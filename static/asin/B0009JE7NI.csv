No wonder it didn't make a lot at the box office, I love Bullock, she is one of my favorite movie stars but this film was just hideous. The only reason I didn't give this movie one star is because the scene with the Dolly Parton was hilarious, practically the only funny scene in the sequel. And what's so great about Regina King? She doesn't seem like a break-out star to me, she's nothing to rave about.

906764,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0009JE7NI,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[6, 8]","It nearly brings me to tears to witness decent actors fall flat on their faces in the middle, correction, right at the start of their ""comeback"" film.  Ergo, I was in need of several Kleenex when I watched Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous because of the horrid direction, acting, and scenario that this film represented.  There was no redeeming value in this film at all.  Normally, I can find one scene in a film that just stood out in my mind, one that perhaps showed that the director had done his homework, or that the actors were having a good time with the script, but alas, this was nowhere to be found in this sequel.  Instead, we are forced to literally watch tumbleweeds roll through the shot after Bullock, Bader, or even King forces a line of comedy from their mouths.  Their timing was horrible.  I kept expecting to hear a laugh track through the film, but there was none.  We, the audience members, having to create our own laughter, but for this film it was definitely impossible.Directors need to realize that if they want to capitalize on the wallets of moviegoers, they need to provide audiences with fresh, original material that gives the viewers that safety-blanket feeling of security that they have spent their money wisely.  This did not happen with Miss Congeniality 2.  Instead, I witnessed a tired Bullock delivering the same old routine from the original, which after watching this disastrous sequel, is a breath of fresh air.  If the repetitive nature wasn't dulling enough, we have to throw in clich&eacute; characters, which can only do clich&eacute; things.  I feel horrible for Diedrich Bader, who is a funny comedian, but was forced into this clich&eacute; gay characters sputtering lines that we have heard time and time again from other products of the Hollywood-recycling machine.  Regina King's character was pointless.  Throughout the entire film I was trying to figure out why she was a major character in this film.  I guess the producers needed someone to counter Bullock's character, but there was no chemistry.  The least they could have done was provide someone that could play off Bullock, instead of against her.  Shatner was, well, Shatner.  He provided nothing fresh to his role other than the fact that it was obvious he needed the cash.  The same can be said for Treat Williams, whom should be hanging his head in shame after this debacle.  Wait, was that Ernie Hudson in this movie?So, we had horrible characters, maybe the story was strong enough to support itself.  WRONG.  The story was just as pointless as the characters.  Bullock, instead of being a model in a pageant this time, is instead a model for the FBI.  Seems very realistic ... doesn't it?!?  It seems like overnight she transforms herself from pageant beauty into sniveling FBI agent back to pageant beauty selling the book about her life.  It seemed random and chaotic, like trying to watch a two-year-old place a square block in a circle entry.  It was painful because I am somewhat of a Bullock fan and to see her grab at this dry material just hurt from the inside.  The main structure of the story was frustrating as well.  Characters were introduced without any story and we were forced to believe them.  The villains of this film were lightweights and provided no humor or fear to anyone in the audience.  It felt as if they let the stand-ins remain in the film while the actors went and played golf.  The timing was horrendous, the structure of this destroyed story was menacing, and there were no jokes that were even worthy of a smile.  From the opening credit sequence through every scene break, I kept thinking to myself it isn't going to get any worse ... alas, I was proven wrong.Finally, I really want to strengthen the idea that jokes need to be funny.  If you tote a comedy as being ""laugh-out-loud"", I expect to be doing that throughout the film.  It felt like amateur night at the comedy club when Bullock walked into every scene.  She should have had a glass of water with her because her delivery was horrible.  Writer Marc Lawrence has done some exceptional work in the past, but somehow he was able to create a story out of all the neglected ideas from his previous work.  It was sad, but there was no humor in this film at all.Overall, this was a huge disappointment for Sandra Bullock as well as the audiences that paid money to see it.  There was nothing of value throughout the entire film.  The jokes were completely absurd and unfunny, while the actors seemed like they just didn't care.  Maybe they were all inside jokes and I just missed the punchline, but nothing was making this old man smile.  Bullock is a great actress, don't get me wrong, but somehow this one caused her to trip on her own two feet and face plant deeply into the concrete floor.  Bader was annoying and completely clich&eacute; ridden, while Regina King proved that she can read cue cards and bring one-dimensional characters to the silver screen.  This was an embarrassment to Hollywood, director John Pasquin (who should never touch another camera again), and everyone involved.  Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous only gave my arm a fabulous twitch (it was the best I could do).Grade: * out of *****",1,Wake up and smell the iced vente decaf caramel

906765,AMIGVTZZIWS6I,B0009JE7NI,Amazon Customer,"[1, 2]","I really wanted to dislike this movie because Miss Congeniality is just one of those films that did not require a sequel.  In making one, all the studio is doing is trying to milk a few more dollars out of a previously good movie.  That being said, it was actually much better than I thought it would be.  While it certainly wasn't as good as Miss Congeniality, it had several funny moments and the interaction between Sandra Bullock and Regina King was great.  At times, they were like a modern day Lucy and Ethel.  Sadly, there just weren't enough of those moments.  The plot was thin and the script seemed to be written by an elementary student.  It's really Bullock and King who make the film watchable.

906766,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0009JE7NI,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I've been thinking about writing this review for some time now and I just now got to doing it.  There have been a lot of negative things said about this film but I want you to forget all of those for a minute.  There are times in life when we just need a laugh, no matter how corny or ridiculous a laugh it really is.  `Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous' gives us just that, laugh after laugh after corny laugh.  Sandra Bullock, aided by the hilarious Regina King, delivers line after line and truly brings on the funny.  I was pleasantly surprised with just how funny this movie really was.  Sure, plot wise it's a bit lame and feels just shy of `been there done that', and I was bummed to see the absence of Michael Caine, but it makes up for all of that with some hysterical performances.In the years that followed the events of the first `Miss Congeniality' film Gracie Hart has become a bit of a celebrity and because of her new status she no longer can work undercover due to her recognizable face.  Instead she becomes the face of the department, going on talkshows and the like to bring good press.  She needs some protection though and that's where Sam Fuller comes in, a hot shot hot headed officer who doesn't like the idea of `protecting' the likes of Gracie Hart.  Yes, Hart has become a bit of a diva (Bullock is just hilarious here, I mean truly hilarious).  Hart changes though when the unthinkable happens.  Her dearest friend and winner of the pageant in the previous film, Cheryl (Miss Rhode Island), and Stan Fields are kidnapped and held for ransom.  She must now try her hardest to rescue them before it is too late.Sandra Bullock and Regina King play off one another beautifully here creating a fun and funny atmosphere that draws the audience in.  Is this film perfect?  No, of course not, but it is a great slice of comedic entertainment.  Sandra Bullock has proven to be the queen of comedy, at least in my book, and this is no exception.  She has a great understanding of what is funny and how to deliver it authentically, never coming across as if she were `acting'.  She's a personable actress who just gets better with each passing film.  Watching her sink into this role is great and I just can't say enough good things about her.  Regina King is another great actress, and while she's not as funny as Bullock here (face it Bullock steals this show) she proves to be a great supporting actress, lending her talents to boost her co-stars performance.So, in the end I can highly recommend this movie, not because it's the most original and innovative comedy out there but because it's funny; and funny deserves some attention.",4,"No, it's not original; yes, it is funny...",1194566400,"11 9, 2007",2007,2661,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'thinking', 'writing', 'review', 'time', 'now', 'just', 'now', 'doing', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'negative', 'things', 'said', 'film', 'want', 'forget', 'minute', 'are', 'times', 'life', 'when', 'just', 'need', 'laugh', 'matter', 'how', 'corny', 'ridiculous', 'laugh', 'really', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', '2', 'Armed', 'Fabulous', 'just', 'laugh', 'corny', 'laugh', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'aided', 'hilarious', 'Regina', 'King', 'delivers', 'line', 'line', 'truly', 'brings', 'funny', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'funny', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'Sure', 'plot', 'wise', 'bit', 'lame', 'feels', 'just', 'shy', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'was', 'bummed', 'see', 'absence', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'up', 'hysterical', 'years', 'followed', 'events', 'first', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', 'film', 'Gracie', 'Hart', 'become', 'bit', 'celebrity', 'new', 'status', 'no', 'longer', 'can', 'work', 'undercover', 'due', 'recognizable', 'face', 'Instead', 'face', 'department', 'going', 'talkshows', 'like', 'bring', 'good', 'press', 'protection', 'where', 'Sam', 'Fuller', 'hot', 'shot', 'hot', 'headed', 'officer', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'idea', 'protecting', 'likes', 'Gracie', 'Hart', 'Yes', 'Hart', 'become', 'bit', 'diva', 'Bullock', 'just', 'hilarious', 'here', 'mean', 'truly', 'hilarious', 'Hart', 'changes', 'when', 'unthinkable', 'happens', 'dearest', 'friend', 'winner', 'pageant', 'previous', 'film', 'Cheryl', 'Miss', 'Rhode', 'Island', 'Stan', 'Fields', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'held', 'ransom', 'must', 'now', 'try', 'hardest', 'rescue', 'too', 'late.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Regina', 'King', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'beautifully', 'here', 'creating', 'fun', 'funny', 'atmosphere', 'audience', 'film', 'perfect', 'No', 'course', 'not', 'great', 'slice', 'comedic', 'entertainment', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'proven', 'be', 'queen', 'comedy', 'least', 'book', 'exception', 'great', 'understanding', 'what', 'funny', 'how', 'deliver', 'authentically', 'never', 'coming', 'were', 'acting', 'personable', 'actress', 'who', 'just', 'better', 'passing', 'film', 'Watching', 'sink', 'role', 'great', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'Regina', 'King', 'great', 'actress', 'not', 'as', 'funny', 'Bullock', 'here', 'face', 'Bullock', 'show', 'be', 'great', 'supporting', 'actress', 'lending', 'talents', 'boost', 'co-stars', 'performance.So', 'end', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'not', 'most', 'original', 'innovative', 'comedy', 'there', 'funny', 'funny', 'deserves', 'attention']",Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous

So her boss has given her the option to be the 'Face of the FBI'.During the show she goes from being a tomboyish figure to being a classy lady that tours the talk shows.

906774,A20IIR0422G3A5,B0009JE7NI,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[4, 8]","`Miss Congeniality 2, Armed and Fabulous' is Sandra Bullock's attempt to star in a sequel which, unlike `Speed 2', doesn't fall flat in the shadow of it's successful father. The attempt is not entirely successful, but it's fun to try to figure out what doesn't work.For starters, we are sorely missing Michael Caine's character of the very talented and very gay Beauty Pagaent consultant who did the original job of converting tomboy agent Gracie Hart into a viable Pagaent contestant. That slot in the story is filled by Diedrich Bader who really does a pretty good job of playing a post `Queer Eye for the Straight Guy' rendition of a gay fashion consultant. We also miss Candice Bergan's character, although that is understandable, as she is probably doing 20 to life in a federal penitentery on a conviction for terrorism and attempted murder. Her role is most dearly missed as the person against which William Shatner's character plays. Missing that interaction, the plot relegates Shatner to just a few very uncomfortable appearances. I hope he was paid well for this gig. It will certainly do nothing for his acting resume.The overall plot premise is reasonable, and a pretty good source of early gags, as FBI agent Hart can no longer work under cover, since her face is so well known from her apearance in the Pageant which was the subject of the first film. The setup continues as Hart is paired with another misfit agent (Regina King) who simply cannot work with any FBI team with which she is assigned. So, we put our two tough nuts together to keep them out of the hair of real agents. The squib on this DVD in my local paper says that the interaction between the two women is one of the few things which works in the movie. This may be true, but even this interaction doesn't work as promised. When the two meet for the first time, the contact immediately creates sparks, but it simply doesn't catch fire. Two agents on the sidelines share comments building some anticipation toward a real donnybrook. But all we get is a little shoving and wordplay.The thing which annoys me the most about the movie is the fact that the primary plot, based on the investigation in Las Vegas to find the kidnapped Miss United States and the emcee (Shatner character) is played out with the tired scenario where the main characters alienate the local FBI command (headed by Treat Williams, another wasted performance) and solve the case while battling both the bad guys and their own command.This annoyance is secondary to the fact that the `bad guys' and their threat is so poorly conceived and executed. Not for once do I believe that the two kidnapped victims are in serious trouble. This is probably due not to the fact that the too little is shown of the heavies, but that too much of the bad guys' action is shown. The perps and the danger in the original movie are kept real, yet well hidden until it is sprung as an effective surprise in the last reel.Comedy can have real danger. In fact, the comedy of peril doesn't really work if the peril isn't believable. Part of what works so well in `Ghostbusters', for example, is that at first Sigourny Weaver, then all of New York City falls under the influence of a burlesqued, but very effective spiritual danger. And, we have no confidence in our heros' ability to save the Big Apple from `Spook Central' and it's minions.Being something of a Sandra Bullock fan, I really can't find a lot missing in her performance. Bullock, Regina King, and Diedrich Bader all carry out their business pretty well. The cuckolded male agent in Las Vegas who becomes the girls' accomplice in their unofficial investigation is a pretty weak role and performance. Ernie Hudson does his usual tall strong black placeholder he has been doing ever since `Ghostbusters'. Most of the weaknesses seem to be in the lame plot and the weak direction.Even the final peril which has agent Hart trapped in a sinking mock galleon is almost totally implausible, from the fact that a simple solution would be to flash their FBI badges for the Treasure Island management to stop the show to the fact that the cannons on the fake galleon would also be fake and probably weight a few dozen pounds rather than the real life several tons they are made out to be.One sure sign that a movie has troubles is when the blooper shots run over the credits are funnier than the movie itself. I also wonder how much money or perks passed to the reviewer who said this movie was `Charming, funny, and even better than the original.' This gent must have little regard for his credibility.Watch it for fun, but spend the price of this movie on a copy of `Ghostbusters' or `Dr. Strangelove'.",4,Good for Sandra Bullock Fans.

906775,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0009JE7NI,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 2]","I'm learning not to listen to film critics. Too many times, as of late, I've watched a movie that these ""film-wise professionals"" have rated as poor or excellent, and completely disagreed with them.Such was the case with this film. Having watched MISS CONGENIALITY when it first came out years ago, I really enjoyed that movie (and so did most critics), but when this sequel showed up and received all kinds of negative press, I stayed away from the theater, not wanting to see something that might diminish my enjoyment of the first flick.But my fears were unfounded ....MISS CONGENIALITY 2 is a good film. It's not great. It's not as good as its predecessor, but it is entertaining, funny and sexy.Sandra Bullock always looks good in my opinion (even when she's stuffed into an FBI agent outfit), and she's got enough attitude and sense of comedic timing that this movie was a nice return to character Gracie Hart, the loveable Fed who infiltrated the Miss America pageant five years ago. And now, after having been seen on national TV, everyone knows her face, thus disrupting her ability to act as an effective agent.So ""the Bureau"" decides to use her as a PR prop and sends her out to give the FBI a morale boost in the public sector. She appears on Regis and Kelly, and even has her own entourage (a gay hair dresser and a make-up specialist.) But when her good friends Miss America (Heather Burns, YOU'VE GOT MAIL, 1998) and Stan Fields (William Shatner, STAR TREK) are kidnaped, she takes the investigation into her own hands with the help of Sam Fuller (Regina King, HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK, 1998), who might remind some of the Gracie Hart we all knew before her pageant days._________________________________________________________________________________________The comedy is spot-on and, at times, laugh-out-loud (especially during a stage scene involving a ""Vegas girl"" and ""Tina Turner"".) The acting is also equally believable.The only issue some might have is the convenient discovery/understanding of where Miss America and Stan Fields might be killed (think about a pirate ship in Las Vegas.)Even so, this film is light and easy viewing with a great touch of laughter.",4,Just Tell The Critics To Shut The #@&* Up!,1137974400,"01 23, 2006",2006,2193,"[""'m"", 'learning', 'not', 'listen', 'film', 'critics', 'Too', 'many', 'times', 'late', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'film-wise', 'professionals', 'have', 'rated', 'poor', 'excellent', 'completely', 'disagreed', 'them.Such', 'was', 'case', 'film', 'Having', 'watched', 'MISS', 'CONGENIALITY', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'years', 'ago', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'so', 'did', 'most', 'critics', 'when', 'sequel', 'showed', 'up', 'received', 'kinds', 'negative', 'press', 'stayed', 'away', 'theater', 'not', 'wanting', 'see', 'something', 'might', 'diminish', 'enjoyment', 'first', 'flick.But', 'fears', 'were', 'unfounded', '.MISS', 'CONGENIALITY', '2', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'predecessor', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'sexy.Sandra', 'Bullock', 'always', 'good', 'opinion', 'even', 'when', 'stuffed', 'FBI', 'agent', 'outfit', 'got', 'enough', 'attitude', 'sense', 'comedic', 'timing', 'movie', 'was', 'nice', 'return', 'character', 'Gracie', 'Hart', 'loveable', 'Fed', 'who', 'infiltrated', 'Miss', 'America', 'pageant', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'now', 'having', 'been', 'seen', 'national', 'TV', 'everyone', 'face', 'thus', 'disrupting', 'ability', 'act', 'effective', 'agent.So', 'Bureau', 'use', 'PR', 'prop', 'give', 'FBI', 'morale', 'boost', 'public', 'sector', 'Regis', 'Kelly', 'even', 'own', 'entourage', 'gay', 'hair', 'dresser', 'make-up', 'specialist', 'when', 'good', 'friends', 'Miss', 'America', 'Heather', 'Burns', 'YOU', 'GOT', 'MAIL', '1998', 'Stan', 'Fields', 'William', 'Shatner', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'are', 'kidnaped', 'investigation', 'own', 'hands', 'help', 'Sam', 'Fuller', 'Regina', 'King', 'HOW', 'STELLA', 'GOT', 'HER', 'GROOVE', 'BACK', '1998', 'who', 'might', 'remind', 'Gracie', 'Hart', 'knew', 'pageant', 'days._________________________________________________________________________________________The', 'comedy', 'spot-on', 'times', 'laugh-out-loud', 'especially', 'stage', 'scene', 'involving', 'Vegas', 'girl', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'acting', 'also', 'equally', 'only', 'issue', 'might', 'have', 'convenient', 'discovery/understanding', 'where', 'Miss', 'America', 'Stan', 'Fields', 'might', 'be', 'killed', 'think', 'pirate', 'ship', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Even', 'so', 'film', 'light', 'easy', 'viewing', 'great', 'touch', 'laughter']",Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous

This is not a falling-down-funny movie, but you're not going to nod off waiting for comedy to happen.Unfortunately, like so many sequels, this movie suffers from the common problem of changing the character.  Sandra Bullock simply isn't the same character as from the first movie.  That always bugs me.  Indeed, in some respects it's like the first movie never happened.  And like so many comedies (well, movies in general), it ignores the way the real world works to either generate laughs or advance the plot.  For example, why would Dolly Parton run away from a person who identifies herself as FBI?  Other than to set up a physical gag, that is.Finally, MC2 is just too long.

It got its laughs by putting Gracie Hart (the always appealing Sandra Bullock) in unfamiliar and ridiculous settings for an FBI agent.  It also had the boy - girl romance thing with her going for another agent.  This bit of fluff, ""Miss Congeniality 2"" is not as good as the first, but is not as bad as its critics claim.  You know it is going to be silly from the title.  Plus you know it is a sequel to a silly movie, so what do you expect?This movie is a buddy film rather than a fish out of water story.  Here, Gracie Hart is all FBI and her media presence does not work as well as the first movie.  She is given Sam Fuller as a bodyguard.  However, Sam Fuller (Roger Ebert notes this is the name a revered movie director who did cameos in many movies as a kind of good luck charm) is a diminutive but fierce and angry woman (played well by Regina King).The specifics of the story are not all that important because it simply provides an excuse for Gracie to be put in ridiculous and embarrassing situations, to have her bosses at the FBI lose faith in her, and for her and Sam to work their way from mutual contempt to best friends.  Since it takes place in Las Vegas they get to put on silly costumes, run through casinos, and do all kinds of things normal people never do.Is it fun?  Yeah, in a diversionary way.

She seemed to have fun with her role as Gracie Hart, and that enthusiasm in her efforts is contagious for the viewer.  I found myself enjoying the mere persona of Bullock's character.  Gracie Hart would be someone people would love as a close friend.  Even her new, slightly (okay, maybe more than slightly) violent partner discovers that in this film.In this film, Miss USA Cheryl Frasier and Pagenat host Stan Fields are kidnapped and Gracie Hart, who because of her extreme fame has been asked to give up undercover assignments and be the spokeswoman for the F.B.I., wants to help in the investigation.Las Vegas F.B.I. supervisor Collins (Treat Williams) is not interested in letting Gracie Hart steal any of the limelight in this high-profile case.  I kept wanting someone to smack this Collins guy!  That means Williams did a fine job in this role.The only problem with this film is that it is almost too much fun and not enough seriousness.  I think people who think this will be more than a comedy, expecting romance, drama, and suspense to somehow evolve, will not enjoy the movie.

906792,AVV1ACH67XI85,B0009JE7NI,"Davalon ""Davalon""","[4, 5]","I am a total Sandra Bullock fan. She has completely won my heart and I've seen every film she's made, and I have to be forced to sit through films. But this film was bizarre on many levels. First off, the film asks us to ""remember"" that Eric Matthews (Benjamin Bratt) had become Gracie's (SB) boyfriend in the first MC-- but in this film, and quite suddenly, I might add, he just drops her, totally. While I ""remembered"" him, when I didn't see his face and just saw Sandy pouting and going through withdrawal pains, it had absolutely no impact whatsoever.The film insists on ""revisiting"" this ""territory"" so that Gracie can have another opportunity to feel ""worthless"" (her word). The fact that MC2 was released five years after MC gave us SO much time and distance that we really could not possibly care about a relationship Gracie was having, especially when we can't see the man she is having it with. On the other hand, I have to take exception with the reviewer who said that Benjamin Bratt was wise not to repeat his role -- why? MC was a big money maker and I don't see that he's won any Oscars in between, so, why not exactly?Also, before I leave this ""area,"" it was insane for the filmmakers to think that the audience would care about or think it funny that Gracie had the same piece of sh** microwave oven and that she was still kicking the door shut (to the point of making the whole thing a crushed mess) -- but now that I think about it, if all she could make for Eric was a frozen chicken pot pie, no wonder he left her (of course, over the phone, with some incredibly lame insane pointless ""excuse"").The next point that's strange is that we are to assume that everyone in the entire world knows who Gracie Hart is -- well, maybe they do, okay, but why did it take the FBI FIVE YEARS to decide to make her the ""FBI Face""? And so, in true sequel fashion, again a gay male stylist Joel (in this case Diedrich Bader, who obviously had a blast playing his part) ""does"" Gracie up -- this time in a manner of seconds -- and voila! Now she's the face of the FBI -- huh? So, we're supposed to assume that after Gracie went through the entire make-over in the first movie that she had learned absolutely NOTHING about rouge and lip gloss? I think not.Anyway, so now Gracie's all dolled up and so she can have protection (from who, herself?), ""Sam"" Fuller (Regina King), an incredibly angry young woman, is hired as her bodyguard. I happen to think that Regina King is enormously talented and should run this planet. I think that she did her best with the material, but to me, it was painfully obvious that she should have just been a lesbian, because that's what this part called for. It was ludicrous to think that this type of woman, especially as she describes herself in the film, is going to be having lots of dates with men.At any rate, some of the fun in this movie is seeing the relationship between Gracie and Sam evolve. Unfortunately there is so much other flotsam and jetsam in the way, that it's really, really hard to care.Okay, so, now Gracie's got a bodyguard, and she's going to Vegas to give a press conference when her one friend in the world, Miss United States Cheryl Frasier(Heather Burns) weirdly wonderful in the first film and tragically pathetic and useless and pointless in the second, is kidnapped, along with Stan Fields (William Shatner) the over-the-top borderline nutcase from the first film who is now amateurish and pathetic in the second.This kidnapping throws Gracie's world into a whirl, and for the next two to three hours (that's how long it felt), she goes against the ""orders"" of her Vegas boss, Treat Williams (who looks damn hot in a suit) and sets out, with the help of a heavily-cajoled Sam, into finding out who-done-it and why.During the course of their ""journey,"" they, natch, end up being female impersonators, just like Nia Vardalos and Toni Collette did in ""Carla and Connie.""The whole inexplicable, convoluted mess of a plot that asks us to believe God knows what about why the two losers were kidnapped is similar to driving us down a road where we suddenly get to a point and there are 10 different ways we can go -- at which point the filmmakers of MC2 said, ""Oh, hell, let's just go down ALL the roads -- at the same time! What's the diff?""While you are trying to make ""sense"" of this ""story,"" you will be reminded several times of Bullock's way with a line -- as well as Bader's and King's. There are several gut-busting jokes that certainly ""helped"" us ""get through"" this ""What would happen if we threw Sandy into an episode of 'Twilight Zone' set in Las Vegas and let her and everybody else in the cast go wild and crazy?""""movie,"" but by the time you get to the end and the fake/phony Miss U.S. ""what do you want"" question is forcibly answered, you simply do not care.[...]",2,"Sandy, Sandy, darling, why?",1153353600,"07 20, 2006",2006,4838,"['am', 'total', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'fan', 'completely', 'won', 'heart', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'made', 'have', 'be',

906795,A2WP0GOTX13MG4,B0009JE7NI,"DJK ver 2.0 ""Reader and Movie Buff""","[0, 0]","'Miss Congeniality 2' is the sequel to, you guessed it, 'Miss Congeniality.'  Sandra Bullock plays Gracie Hart, an FBI agent, that before the events of the original movie, was considered a black sheep in the FBI.  After preventing a bombing at the Miss United States pageant, in which she entered as Miss New Jersey, Hart finds herself working in New York again.  Things turn sour for her after her boyfriend dumps her, and she is approached by the FBI to become 'the Face of the FBI.'  This builds on the change from tomboy to pretty girl from the first movie, and further changes the character.Before long, Hart's friend, and the winner from the Miss United States pageant, is kidnapped.  Hart has been touring the country and making the talk show rounds as the Face of the FBI, escorted by troubled, loner agent Sam Fuller, played by Regina King.  Hart is sent to Las Vegas, the site of the kidnapping, to be the Agency's liason to the media.What made the first movie great was the Tom Boy to Prom Queen transformation of Bullock's character.  In the sequel, we're already at the Prom Queen, and we see Bullock's character become a Diva, which isn't nearly as fun.  Bullock as FBI agent actually seems to regress and becomes what you'd expect of the Prom Queen playing FBI agent.This movie does have its moments.  The Drag Queen Diva lounge is particularly uproarious.  A run in with a famous country singer is also good for some laughs.Overall, its good for a rental, but not repeat viewings.  It just doesn't match the charm of the first movie.  I'd recommend it if you liked the first movie and want to see more of Bullock's character, or if you just like Bullock in general.Overall Grade:  3.25 stars.",3,"A Sequel, BUT....",1124236800,"08 17, 2005",2005,1708,"[""'Miss"", 'Congeniality', '2', 'sequel', 'guessed', 'Congeniality', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Gracie', 'Hart', 'FBI', 'agent', 'events', 'original', 'movie', 'was', 'considered', 'black', 'sheep', 'FBI', 'preventing', 'bombing', 'Miss', 'United', 'States', 'pageant', 'entered', 'Miss', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Hart', 'working', 'New', 'York', 'again', 'Things', 'turn', 'sour', 'boyfriend', 'approached', 'FBI', 'become', ""'the"", 'Face', 'FBI', 'change', 'tomboy', 'pretty', 'girl', 'first', 'movie', 'further', 'changes', 'character.Before', 'long', 'Hart', 'friend', 'winner', 'Miss', 'United', 'States', 'pageant', 'kidnapped', 'Hart', 'been', 'touring', 'country', 'making', 'talk', 'show', 'Face', 'FBI', 'escorted', 'troubled', 'loner', 'agent', 'Sam', 'Fuller', 'played', 'Regina', 'King', 'Hart', 'sent', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'site', 'kidnapping', 'be', 'Agency', 'liason', 'media.What', 'made', 'first', 'movie', 'great', 'was', 'Tom', 'Boy', 'Prom', 'Queen', 'transformation', 'Bullock', 'character', 'sequel', ""'re"", 'already', 'Prom', 'Queen', 'see', 'Bullock', 'character', 'become', 'Diva', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'fun', 'Bullock', 'FBI', 'agent', 'actually', 'regress', 'becomes', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Prom', 'Queen', 'playing', 'FBI', 'agent.This', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'Drag', 'Queen', 'Diva', 'lounge', 'particularly', 'uproarious', 'run', 'famous', 'country', 'singer', 'also', 'good', 'laughs.Overall', 'good', 'rental', 'not', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'just', ""n't"", 'match', 'charm', 'first', 'movie', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'liked', 'first', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'Bullock', 'character', 'just', 'Bullock', 'general.Overall', 'Grade', '3.25', 'stars']",Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous

906800,ANMFFCVZ3KM81,B0009JE7NI,"F. Williams ""TheFarisReel on Facebook""","[1, 4]","I only have two words to sum up my feelings on this film: NOT FUNNY!!!Sandra Bullock reprises her role as FBI agent Gracie Hart in this sequel to her 2000 hit film Miss Congeniality. The first thing you notice in this sub-par sequel is that two key elements from the first film are missing, and those are Benjamin Bratt (as FBI agent Eric Mathews) and ultra wonderful Michael Caine (as Victor Melling); however, after viewing the film I can definitely understand why neither reprised their roles.This time around Hart after trying to return to her normal duties with the force must circum to her popularity. Unable to continue uncover operations due to her stint in the Ms United States pageant, Agent Hart becomes the new face of the FBI. A book deal and television circuit tour follow. Meanwhile, the current Ms United States, Cheryl Frasier (Miss Rhode Island from the first film) again played by Heather Burns; is also on her publicity tour as the reigning pageant winner. Accompanying the reigning Queen is none other than Ms United States Masters of Ceremonies, Mr. Stan Fields played once again by William Shatner.After the reigning Ms United States is kidnapped, Agent Hart is sent to Las Vegas to serve as the FBI's official press flunky. A set of circumstances in which Agent Hart body slams real life Country Western singer Dolly Parton, very similar to her Alamo sequence from the first film; places Agent Hart on the FBI's sh@# list once again. Forced to reestablish her back in the good graces of the FBI, Agent Hart must go against the agency rules and regulation; perform in a drag show with a really big headdress on; and solve the case without anyone else's help all before the reigning queen's ransom time limit expires.This film tries to rely on sight gags and situations to establish comic relief, but fails miserably. For example, we see Agent Hart in a Las Vegas showgirl headdress extending outside the sunroof of a car; rather than having her take off the headdress.... NOT FUNNY. What's even worse, we are forced to endure seeing her Personal Assistant in the same outfit.... REALLY NOT FUNNY!!!!Take the hot poker in the eye.....

Alas, I bought it during a busy time at the five-dollar bin and there were a lot of people shuffling through the selections. I just wanted to get about 10 DVDs and get out of there. A mistake on my part. I picked up some good DVDs, to be sure, but two were real turkeys and this DVD was one of them. I should have know better than pick up a ""Two"" in a series when I hadn't seen the ""One."" My mistake, again, but I've seen Sandra Bullock in other things I've enjoyed and the DVD had a nice-looking cover. This ""Miss Congeniality 2"" DVD was just an awful movie, one of the worst I've seen in months. I guess it was supposed to be a comedy, but genuine laughs were few and far apart. The entire plot was just asinine and the director was locked in and seemingly couldn't do anything with it. A strange thing was that I seemed to be getting into it right at first, but after the first 15 minutes the movie just got worse and worse and by the end it was just pathetic. I could sense that almost the entire cast knew they were walking through a turkey and rescuing it was out of their control. If I had to  give a ""best actor"" award, it would be the to the gay guy who seemed to be the only one having a good time and really into his part of the story. There were small-part appearances by some famous actors, Regis Philbin, William Shattner and Dolly Parton come immediately to mind. My  guess would be that they regretted lending themselves to this kind of embarrassing film atrocity. Surely they wouldn't be needing the money, one would hope.Gary Peterson",1,"A Really Lame Movie.

The film follows the routine formula where simpleton characters offer one-dimensional personalities with very little depth.  This is not because the actors cannot act, but rather because the story as a whole seems fatally flawed in development as seen in poorly made sitcoms.  A fortunate event is that Crash (2004) had a delayed release where Sandra Bullock pulled off a stellar performance, which is proof that she is a very talented actress.  Hopefully, this film will drift into oblivion and not remerge with another sequel with the FBI agent Gracie Hart (Sandra Bullock).Gracie finds her FBI career compromised when people recognize her presence due to the Miss United States beauty pageant show where she competed while solving a crime as an undercover agent.  The FBI is also suffering from some bad press, which compels administration at the FBI to request that Gracie become the new face of the FBI.  This is something she does not want to do, but her options are limited and she agrees to approach her new assignment.  Through her assignment she must be presentable and the FBI hires her a stylist, Joel (Diedrich Bader) with two assistants. In the middle of this she also finds out that her boyfriend is dumping her, which presents a new situation for her that she does not know how to deal with.After ten months of training and talk shows Gracie meets with one of her friends Cheryl (Heather Burns) who most know as Miss United States.  It is a dear reunion, but their ways must part, as they both have to get back to their hectic lives.  Shortly after, Cheryl and Stan Fields (William Shatner), whom we know from the first film, are kidnapped and the kidnappers demand five million dollars for her life.  Gracie is asked to fly to Las Vegas with her newly assigned bodyguard, FBI agent Sam Fuller (Regina King) and no it is not the director, where Cheryl was kidnapped to act as the spokesperson for the FBI press conferences, but she cannot stay out of the loop so she starts her own investigation.Miss Congeniality 2 has moments of humor and some valuable messages.  However, much of the humor seems to evaporate through awkward and crude humor that occasionally feels untimely and out of place.  There are also situations where the film tries to give valuable lessons, but the lessons emerge with simplistic self-importance obvious enough for a toddler to understand.  One should expect a little more from a film that is rated PG-13.  In the end, the film has offered some moments of entertainment, but also moments of awkwardness and narrative clumsiness, which truly hurts the overall cinematic experience.",2,Inelegant Comedy with Graceless Narrative...,1119398400,"06 22, 2005",2005,2826,"['first', 'word', 'lips', 'when', 'thinking', 'sequels', 'hackneyed', 'Miss', 'Congeniality', '2', 'Armed', 'Dangerous', 'word', 'meaning', 'film', 'freshness', 'originality', 'film', 'routine', 'formula', 'where', 'simpleton', 'characters', 'offer', 'one-dimensional', 'personalities', 'very', 'little', 'depth', 'not', 'actors', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'rather', 'story', 'whole', 'fatally', 'flawed', 'development', 'seen', 'poorly', 'made', 'sitcoms', 'fortunate', 'event', 'Crash', '2004', 'had', 'delayed', 'release', 'where', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'pulled', 'off', 'stellar', 'performance', 'proof', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'Hopefully', 'film', 'will', 'drift', 'oblivion', 'not', 'remerge', 'sequel', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Gracie', 'Hart', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', '.Gracie', 'FBI', 'career', 'compromised', 'when', 'people', 'recognize', 'presence', 'due', 'Miss', 'United', 'States', 'beauty', 'pageant', 'show', 'where', 'competed', 'solving', 'crime', 'undercover', 'agent', 'FBI', 'also', 'suffering', 'bad', 'press', 'administration', 'FBI', 'request', 'Gracie', 'become', 'new', 'face', 'FBI', 'something', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'options', 'are', 'limited', 'approach', 'new', 'assignment', 'assignment', 'must', 'be', 'presentable', 'FBI', 'stylist', 'Joel', 'Diedrich', 'Bader', 'two', 'assistants', 'middle', 'also', 'out', 'boyfriend', 'dumping', 'new', 'situation', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'deal', 'with.After', 'ten', 'months', 'training', 'talk', 'shows', 'Gracie', 'meets', 'one', 'friends', 'Cheryl', 'Heather', 'Burns', 'who', 'most', 'know', 'Miss', 'United', 'States', 'dear', 'reunion', 'ways', 'must', 'part', 'have', 'get', 'back', 'hectic', 'lives', 'Shortly', 'Cheryl', 'Stan', 'Fields', 'William', 'Shatner', 'whom', 'know', 'first', 'film', 'are', 'kidnapped', 'kidnappers', 'demand', 'five', 'million', 'dollars', 'life', 'Gracie', 'asked', 'fly', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'newly', 'assigned', 'bodyguard', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Sam', 'Fuller', 'Regina', 'King', 'not', 'director', 'where', 'Cheryl', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'act', 'spokesperson', 'FBI', 'press', 'conferences', 'can', 'not', 'stay', 'loop', 'own', 'investigation.Miss', 'Congeniality', '2', 'moments', 'humor', 'valuable', 'messages', 'However', 'much', 'humor', 'evaporate', 'awkward', 'crude', 'humor', 'occasionally', 'untimely', 'place', 'are', 'also', 'situations', 'where', 'film', 'tries', 'give', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'lessons', 'emerge', 'simplistic', 'self-importance', 'obvious', 'enough', 'toddler', 'understand', 'One', 'should', 'expect', 'little', 'more', 'film', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'end', 'film', 'offered', 'moments', 'entertainment', 'also', 'moments', 'awkwardness', 'narrative', 'clumsiness', 'truly', 'overall', 'cinematic', 'experience']",Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous

Not that the original ""Miss Congeniality"" (2000) was classic cinema art, but at least it had the charm of Sandra Bullock's transformation from a gauche, style-challenged FBI agent into a svelte beauty queen who could stop a criminal with a well-placed knee to the privates, smiling all the while. Memorable turns by Michael Caine and Candice Bergen helped as well. This follow-up, which Benjamin Bratt, Bullock's love interest in the first film, wisely eschewed, finds the star mostly going over old ground, now paired with a grim-faced Regina King and off to Las Vegas to try and rescue Heather Burns, back as Miss United States, and William Shatner, back as Stanley the pageant host, from kidnappers holding them for ransom. Once again there is a flamboyant gay stylist (Diedrich Bader), a skeptical superior (Treat Williams, stiffly playing the Las Vegas bureau chief), fish-out-of-water comedy (King playing a man playing Tina Turner in a drag show), and an explosive conclusion. Bullock is amusing in her new consciousness of style, and she and King occasionally do strike some comic sparks, but a script that tries to get laughs by having the star bring Dolly Parton down with a flying tackle and knee Regis Philbin in the groin is one that's obviously going for the lowest comic denominator.

906814,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0009JE7NI,Lawyeraau,"[1, 1]","As a sequel, this film surprisingly succeeds. Sandra Bullock, with her coltish good looks and her spot on comedic timing, successfully reprises the role of Gracie Hart, FBI agent. In fact, I enjoyed this film even more than I did the prequel, where Gracie Hart infiltrated a national beauty pageant as a contestant, her affableness winning her the award for Miss Congeniality.It now appears, however, that Agent Hart's ability to work effectively as an agent has been compromised by the publicity that she received from her entry into that national beauty pageant. Gracie Hart is now instantly recognizable, whenever she hits the streets, by an adoring public who has taken to her as a duck takes to water.This being the case, the powers that be at the FBI decide to make Agent Hart into a poster girl for the FBI, and she is given a mini entourage to polish their diamond in the rough. By the time they get through with her, Agent Hart is as slick and as polished as a cover girl, temporarily losing sight of why she joined the FBI in the first place.Agent Hart is assigned a bodyguard, problem child agent, Sam Fuller (Regina King), who has some serious anger management issues. They get initially get along together like oil and water, with some funny comedic moments between the two. Ultimately, at the eleventh hour, their relationship evolves into one of mutual respect.When Agent Hart's best friend, Miss United States (Heather Burns), is kidnapped in Las Vegas, along with pageant official Stan Fields (William Shatner), Agent Hart remembers why it was that she joined the FBI in the first place. Although she is brought into the case strictly as a media liaison, she desperately wants to be taken seriously as an agent on the case, Unfortunately, her investigative efforts are stymied by the local FBI chief, Agent Collins (Treat Williams), who views her as expendable fluff.While the storyline may be thin, at times, there are enough memorable moments to sustain the film, not least being the excellent comedic performances given by Sandra Bullock and Regina King. It is a professionally successful pairing of two talented actresses with a flair for the comedic. Sandra Bullock proves, once again, that one can be gorgeous and funny. For Regina King, the role of Sam Fuller is a breakout comedic role for her.Moreover, the supporting cast is likewise funny. William Shatner, who of late has proven himself to have a deft comedic touch, provides some wacky moments. It was also great to see Treat Williams, who is as attractive as ever, playing the role of Agent Collins, the tightly controlled, ego driven, local FBI chief who seeks to wrap up the case successfully for his own personal aggrandizement. Elizabeth Rohm, of Law and Order fame, is a pleasant surprise in the small role of Carol Fields, the FBI agent who is two timing her fellow agent boyfriend with their mutual boss.Although the film has some plot holes and may be implausible, at times, it still provides some enjoyable comedic moments. There are also cameo appearances by Regis Philbin and his wife, Joy. While this film may not be everyone's cup of tea, fans of Ms. Bullock will surely enjoy seeing her in this one.

They ended the original quite perfectly, without ending it hinting a sequel. However, they decided to cash in on the success, and bring out a sequel. Michael Caine turned it down. Benjamin Bratt declined. Only Sandra Bullock, Ernie Hudson, Heather Burns & William Shatner (obviously taking a break from filming his branflakes commercials here in the UK) returned. Really, this should have been another Speed 2 - a complete flop. And it almost did, it got bad reviews in everything I read.I got it three days ago, and I've already watched it twice. I liked this film. OK, it doesn't have the same magic that the original did, which has to be one of my favourite movies, but Sandra Bullock can do no wrong in my eyes. (I'm forgetting about Two Weeks Notice and Murder By Numbers here.) And the mismatched partners haven't worked in years, especially not when they're both females - come on, that hasn't worked since Thelma & Louise. And there are some stereotypes, including the angry black FBI agent (played by Regina King) from a poor background.I didn't like the fact Gracie's character changed so much in the 10-month period that passes in the film. She becomes conceited, and forgets why she originally joined the FBI in the first place. And they completely wrote out Benjamin's character from the first, having him phone Gracie, in one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in the whole movie. Her first 'real' boyfriend, and he dumps her over the phone (the jerk) after only 3 weeks. (Since this starts 3 weeks after the original finished.) Also, if you watch the end credits, there's quite a few outtakes, and it gives the impression there were a lot of scenes which ended up on the cutting room floor. Also, in the kidnapping, even though she gets kidnapped too, Cheryl Frasier (Heather Burns) seems to be implicated in it, but that subplot seems to be forgotton.The storyline's stretched as thinly as possible over the nearly 2 hours it is, but there are quite a few funny moments to keep you going. Michael Caine's character is replaced by Joel (played by Diedrich Bader, who was also in Napoleon Dynamite), a camper, cute version, who comes out with a few funny lines, including genital-shocking taser gun, debriefing and a couple of others. There's also a hilarious cameo from Dolly Parton, which will have you looking to see if it really is her, and of course, the whole Diva Club scene - ""I am not going out there as a woman pretending to be a man pretending to be Tina Turner. I can't afford therapy on my salary."" Also look out for Sandy's now-husband, Jesse James, in the bar scene near the start. And Eileen Brennan, who played Stan's mum in the film, is actually 7 years younger than William.The problem with this film is none of Sandy's funny moments (only her snorts reappear) happen, and some scenes are just too close to the original. When she's talking on the phone to Eric Matthews, she's sticking that flat thing into the microwave door to keep it shut, or the scene where she jumps on Dolly Parton is practically the same as the original, where she jumped on the guy for going for his cigarettes. And plus, in the airport scene, there is definitely a scene cut out somewhere, as Sandy seems to be wearing a pair of very fake boobs under her top, which at one point Regina King adjusts, but they're down at her stomach! That scene fell a bit flat. Plus, a very prominent poster in the same scene is desperately trying to steal some screen time - it's a poster of Miss Congeniality.The finale is absolutely stunning, and breath taking, especially with the water scenes - I was having trouble breathing during these scenes, especially since there was a lot of closeup shots of the actresses. There's another scene tacked on at the end, which is a bit too sickly sweet for my liking, and brings back the ""world peace"" which featured so much in the original.The soundtrack to this, featuring Tina Turner, Pink, and Natasha Bedingfield, is one of the most feel good soundtracks next to Coyote Ugly. But what most surprised me is there is a lot of snippets from other soundtracks including: My Best Friend's Wedding, Two Weeks Notice, Miss Congeniality, Chicken Run (?), Gossip, Sweet November, and I Am Sam.

Yes, she has to go undercover for this operation, and the male-dominated FBI had few options.  However, Gracie pulls it off, and the day is saved.  This transformation is FUNNY, and the story works.In Miss Congeniality 2, Agent Hart's recognition factor is affecting her ability to be a successful agent.

She is given a choice:  be the public relations face of the Bureau, or... a desk job.She choses to be congenial.

She's on a bank stakeout to capture an organized group of bank robbers called The Housewives.  But things go wrong when Gracie is recognized by an adoring fan, and the Housewives almost get away.  Now considered too recognizable to be a field agent, her popularity jeopardizing herself and other agents, FBI Director MacDonald (Ernie Hudson) decides to make Gracie the ""New face of the FBI"", a publicity position.  Agent Eric Matthews has broken up with her (they were together at the end of the first movie) so Gracie decides to take the position.  She's introduced to effeminate Joel Meyers (Diedrich Bader - Office Space, The Beverly Hillbillies) who's going to do a total makeover on her, not just makeup and walking like Victor Melling did, but attitude and public appearance as well.  (Diedrich Bader is fantastic in his role as Meyers)Ten months later, Gracie is making television appearances on Regis's show, author of a book, and traveling everywhere on publicity tours to promote the FBI as a kinder, gentler organization.  Assigned to be her body guard is new agent Sam Fuller (Regina King), a tough, angry, undisciplined agent who no one wants to work with.  Sam doesn't take crap from anybody, and especially dislikes Gracie who is now the epitome of what she hates in women.  When Miss United States Cheryl Frasier and Master Of Ceremonies Stan Fields are kidnapped and held for ransom in Las Vegas, MacDonald sends Gracie there to handle all the press conferences.  But Cheryl is Gracie's friend, and Gracie can't just stand by the sidelines; she's an agent after all.  So Gracie, against MacDonald's wishes, dives headfirst into the investigation, dragging Sam with her.  She's determined to find her friends before the kidnapper kills them.'Miss Congeniality 2: Armed And Fabulous' was a disappointment after the first movie.  It's more stilted and seems to try too hard to be funny, whereas the humor in the first movie flowed naturally.  The plot isn't as well written as the first movie either.  Sandra Bullock still gives an amazing performance, but its wasted in this sequel.  Although, the drag show near the end is pretty hilarious, even if it wasn't necessary to the plot.  William Shatner doesn't look well in this movie, and his role wasn't nearly as cleverly written.  The visit to Stan's mother at the nursing home was funny also.Overall, this sequel was unfortunately a miss, which was disappointing to me.  I liked the Gracie Hart character so well I would have watched a third movie, but Armed And Dangerous was such a flop that a third movie with the character will never happen.  I'm giving the movie 3 stars simply for Sandra Bullock's performance, without her the movie would be 0 stars.  Rent, don't buy.

It's hard to believe this is even related to the first one which was overflowing with belly laughs and originality. The lines they delivered were not even remotely funny but they gave plenty of room after each joke for the audience to laugh. The long pauses were silent in my theatre (partly because everyone had already left to get some popcorn or better amuse themselves). Riding on the success of Miss C 1, the writers made a fatal error. They didn't understand the reason of the success of the first. Sandra Bullock's clumsy and unfeminine character, her perfectly cast side-kicks with hilarious zingers, and a creative plot were what made it a hit. In the second edition, her character was annoying and WAY over done, the side characters were equally grating on the nerves (specifically the cliched gay consultant who had ZERO funny lines), and the plot was far fetched without being enjoyable.

906850,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0009JE7NI,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 8]","Do we really want ""Miss Congeniality 2 - Armed and Fabulous,"" unnecessary sequel while we have the surprisingly entertaining original made five years ago?  It depends on your expectation level.  Keep that very low, and you may like this run-of-the-mill comedy, like watching a TV sit-com extended to lengthy two hours.Excuse my bitter words, but from the beginning to the end ""Miss Congeniality 2 - Armed and Fabulous"" makes wrong steps -- Sandra Bullock's Gracie Hart is back, which is fine.  But as her face is widely known, she cannot do any undercover assignment, so she starts to work on an FBI PR campaign.  Gracie begins to consider herself as celebrity, clad in the expensive costumes like Anna Nicole Smith, and appears on a TV show to promote her (ghost-written) book.In addition to these hackneyed ideas, ""MC2"" tells us that Gracie's friend Cheryl (Heather Burns) and Stan Fields (William Shatner) are kidnapped by two masked guys on the street of Las Vegas, to which Gracie flies for the most unconvinging reason I have heard in the film's history.  Oh, and Sandra Bullock's silly, very silly costumes continue, including one in wheelchair (disguised as an old lady) and one big featherly creature from the Sesami Street.  Oh, dear, I love you Sandra, but not this.[NO CAINE, NO FUN] All these things could have been forgiven if there is chemistry between Sandra Bullock's Gracie and her new 'buddy' Sam Fuller (Regina King, 'Ray').  There is none that reminds me of Benjamin Bratt's good-natured personality here.  To make matters much, much worse, Michael Caine is gone, replaced by 'fashion advisor' Joel (Diedrich Bader) whose mannnerism, based on poor copy of Caine, is just irritating and awfully unfunny.  Finally, when Treat Williams as FBI officer in charge appears with bad acting, the whole film starts to go down to the bottom of the theme parks of Las Vegas, the town which is repeatedly shown on the scree for no other reason than that it is another kind of production placement.The original ""Miss Congeniality"" was not critic's favorite, but it gave Sandra Bullock a prestigious Golden-Globe nomination.  The sequel unwittingly tells us that a good support and decent (if not special) scripts was the key to that, both of which fatally lack in ""Miss Congeniality 2 - Armed and Fabulous.""",2,"Where Is Michael Caine, and a Decent Story?

906851,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B0009JE7NI,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[0, 0]","Miss Congeniality was such a great action comedy, and Sandra Bullock was perfect in it, but the sequel isn't as good, because the characters are not well written, and the performances from the supporting cast is weaker than the original's cast members including Michael Caine, Candice Bergen, and Benjamin Bratt. Sandra Bullock gave her best effort to reprise the role of a tomboy FBI agent, and this time she's not as enjoyable to watch, especially since there's no romance plot for her.Gracie Hart(Bullock) became a celebrity after her undercover stint in the Miss United States pageant, and now she's too famous to go undercover again, since she's recognized and pursued by fans of her best-selling book everywhere. She's assigned to be the PR spokesperson, and she gets to have an expensive wardrobe and go on talk shows. Her ultra-butch bodyguard Sam(Regina King) constantly clashes with her, and they easily get verbal and physical with each other when they disagree.Meanwhile, Gracie's friend Cheryl, the new Miss USA and a slot machine junkie(Stan/William Shatner) got kidnapped by two masked criminals. The criminals sent out a video tape to Gracie to demand a huge ransom in order to release Cheryl and Stan. Then Gracie and Sam would have to go out of their way and perform in a drag show in order to solve the case.Treat Williams played a crooked Las Vegas district FBI boss and he's a vival to Gracie. His role is weak and didn't generate much of a performance. Dolly Parton made a cameo performance as herself being chased and attacked by Gracie in a hotel when she was mistaken for being a D.P. impersonator/criminal. That was probably a funnier moment in this film. Regina King and Sandra Bullock didn't have a whole lot of chemistry, and her Tina Turner drag number was not very convincing. Shatner was totally underused in this film, and he hardly a funny moment or lines to deliver. Overall, I didn't find the jokes to be that funny, and the action was not exciting to watch. I guess the main flaw was the poor script that made this sequel not so worthwhile. You pretty much have to be a die-hard Sandra Bullock fan to enjoy this movie. I think it's time for her to another romantic comedy or a serious drama.",3,Sandra Bullock Didn't Get To Have As Much Fun This Time.,1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,2228,"['Miss', 'Congeniality', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'action', 'comedy', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'was', 'perfect', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'written', 'performances', 'supporting', 'cast', 'weaker', 'original', 'cast', 'members', 'including', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'gave', 'best', 'effort', 'reprise', 'role', 'tomboy', 'FBI', 'agent', 'time', 'not', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'especially', 'romance', 'plot', 'her.Gracie', 'Hart', 'Bullock', 'became', 'celebrity', 'undercover', 'stint', 'Miss', 'United', 'States', 'pageant', 'now', 'too', 'famous', 'go', 'undercover', 'again', 'recognized', 'pursued', 'fans', 'best-selling', 'book', 'everywhere', 'assigned', 'be', 'PR', 'spokesperson', 'have', 'expensive', 'wardrobe', 'go', 'talk', 'shows', 'ultra-butch', 'bodyguard', 'Sam', 'Regina', 'King', 'constantly', 'easily', 'get', 'verbal', 'physical', 'other', 'when', 'disagree.Meanwhile', 'Gracie', 'friend', 'Cheryl', 'new', 'Miss', 'USA', 'slot', 'machine', 'junkie', 'Stan/William', 'Shatner', 'got', 'kidnapped', 'two', 'masked', 'criminals', 'criminals', 'sent', 'out', 'video', 'tape', 'Gracie', 'demand', 'huge', 'ransom', 'order', 'release', 'Cheryl', 'Stan', 'Then', 'Gracie', 'Sam', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'way', 'perform', 'drag', 'show', 'order', 'solve', 'case.Treat', 'Williams', 'played', 'crooked', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'district', 'FBI', 'boss', 'vival', 'Gracie', 'role', 'weak', 'did', ""n't"", 'generate', 'much', 'performance', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'made', 'cameo', 'performance', 'herself', 'being', 'chased', 'attacked', 'Gracie', 'hotel', 'when', 'was', 'mistaken', 'being', 'D.P', 'impersonator/criminal', 'was', 'probably', 'funnier', 'moment', 'film', 'Regina', 'King', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'whole', 'lot', 'chemistry', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'drag', 'number', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'Shatner', 'was', 'totally', 'underused', 'film', 'hardly', 'funny', 'moment', 'lines', 'deliver', 'Overall', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'jokes', 'be', 'funny', 'action', 'was', 'not', 'exciting', 'watch', 'guess', 'main', 'flaw', 'was', 'poor', 'script', 'made', 'sequel', 'not', 'so', 'worthwhile', 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'be', 'die-hard', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'fan', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'think', 'time', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'serious', 'drama']",Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous
