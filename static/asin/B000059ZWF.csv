575459,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B000059ZWF,DVD Verdict,"[2, 4]","Judge Tom Becker, DVD Verdict -- ""Defiance is a reasonably entertaining if forgettable little film. Rather than offering up an action/exploitation-fest, director John Flynn--who's turned out action/exploitation fests like Rolling Thunder, Lock Up, and Out for Justice--keeps everything down a couple of notches here. The result is a film that's a bit too slow-moving and restrained for its own good. Since these character types are so familiar that you can figure out their backstories the minute they open their mouths, you might find yourself checking your watch while waiting for the Souls to show up and trash a convenience store or smack around an old man. While they're definitely menacing loons, the Souls don't really look like they'd be all that hard to take down. The gang could be called the Old Souls; while mischief-making street gangs are usually havens for teens, there's not a soul in the Souls who looks to be under 35. Besides being disco-era stylish, they're agreeably multicultural and drive around in a cool car. Thanks to his pretty-boy good looks, Jan-Michael Vincent was a fairly significant low-tier star in the '70s. With Defiance, the mid-30s Vincent started settling into more mature roles. Tommy Gamble is not exactly a demanding part, but Vincent's tight-lipped, distanced persona serves him well here; plus, he's surrounded by enough enjoyably hammy supporting actors (including Danny Aiello as a loud-mouth local, and Art Carney as a wise and fearless old shopkeeper) to keep things interesting. Defiance comes to us from MGM's DVD-R ""on demand"" line. Picture and audio are acceptable, and the only extra is a trailer that features pretty much every interesting part of the film.""",3,Death Wish-lite with a side of High Noon,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,1712,"['Judge', 'Tom', 'Becker', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'Defiance', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'forgettable', 'little', 'film', 'Rather', 'offering', 'up', 'action/exploitation-fest', 'director', 'John', 'Flynn', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'action/exploitation', 'fests', 'Rolling', 'Thunder', 'Lock', 'Up', 'Out', 'Justice', 'everything', 'down', 'couple', 'notches', 'here', 'result', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'slow-moving', 'restrained', 'own', 'good', 'character', 'types', 'are', 'so', 'familiar', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'backstories', 'minute', 'open', 'mouths', 'might', 'find', 'checking', 'watch', 'waiting', 'Souls', 'show', 'up', 'trash', 'convenience', 'store', 'smack', 'old', 'man', ""'re"", 'definitely', 'menacing', 'loons', 'Souls', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'take', 'down', 'gang', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'Old', 'Souls', 'mischief-making', 'street', 'gangs', 'are', 'usually', 'havens', 'teens', 'not', 'soul', 'Souls', 'who', 'be', '35', 'being', 'disco-era', 'stylish', ""'re"", 'agreeably', 'multicultural', 'drive', 'around', 'cool', 'car', 'Thanks', 'pretty-boy', 'good', 'looks', 'Jan-Michael', 'Vincent', 'was', 'fairly', 'significant', 'low-tier', 'star', ""'70s"", 'Defiance', 'mid-30s', 'Vincent', 'started', 'settling', 'more', 'mature', 'roles', 'Tommy', 'Gamble', 'not', 'exactly', 'demanding', 'part', 'Vincent', 'tight-lipped', 'distanced', 'persona', 'well', 'here', 'surrounded', 'enough', 'enjoyably', 'hammy', 'supporting', 'actors', 'including', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'loud-mouth', 'local', 'Art', 'Carney', 'wise', 'fearless', 'old', 'shopkeeper', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'Defiance', 'MGM', 'DVD-R', 'demand', 'line', 'Picture', 'audio', 'are', 'acceptable', 'only', 'extra', 'trailer', 'pretty', 'much', 'interesting', 'part', 'film']",N/A

I was glad when I saw it finally available on DVD. I'm puzzled though as to why it was released on a DVD-R format. I'm sure that this film was popular (at least in cult status), to warrant a release on standard DVD.

The story line is a little weak.  However, in my opinion this is one of the two best performances that Jan Michael Vincent ever gave.  He is backed up by a very good cast of outstanding character actors.  The music sets the stage for the suspense and the action is good without being grisly.  This may not be high art, but it perhaps serves a higher purpose.  When you come home from a brutal day and you don't want to think...you just want to be entertained....see the downtrodden guy win....see someone beat the odds.....put this movie in your player, unplug your brain, crack a cold one, lean back and enjoy the ride.
