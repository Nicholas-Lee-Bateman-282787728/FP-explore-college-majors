501911,AREUUNVSKKODF,B00000I1OX,"John T. Ehrhart ""JohnOfKaty""","[1, 1]","Well this is definitely one of the weirdest snow ski movies I've ever seen.  And when I first saw it, I tried to cross-referrence the characters in it compared to the ones in the Police Academy movies.  It stars Roger Rose, Yvette Nipar, T.K. Carter, the late Ray Walston, and Martin Mull.  Snowy Peaks I believe which is the name of this ski resort is where it takes place, and they are about to be evaluated on their performance, and when Martin Mull finds out about it, he tries to blackball their safety features so they can close down so he can takeover the ski resort and make his own resort,  it's up to the ski resort to save it's reputation and keep it open.  To me, the funniest part is the guy SUICIDE...the guy with a THREE part personality when he does the snowboard, and rocket skis and a lot of other stunts.  The other funny part is when the ski patrollers pull a prank on their instructor Murray because he's so short, they give him ""growth pills"" making him think he's growing when taking them.  Since this movie was created by Police Academy producer PAUL MASLANSKY, you know it's gotta be a classic!  I hope that it will become a DVD RErelease because it is hilarious and deserves a resurrection!  Another thing that kinda steals the movie is the cute bull dog DUMPSTER cause whenever Murray would fall down, the dog would be there snorting, slobbering and spitting everywhere.  Anyway, I hope they make a DVD for it cause I wanna buy it.",5,Tired of making Police Academy movies eh Mr. Maslansky?,1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,1458,"['Well', 'definitely', 'one', 'weirdest', 'snow', 'ski', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'tried', 'cross-referrence', 'characters', 'compared', 'ones', 'Police', 'Academy', 'movies', 'Roger', 'Rose', 'Yvette', 'Nipar', 'T.K', 'Carter', 'late', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'Martin', 'Mull', 'Snowy', 'Peaks', 'believe', 'name', 'ski', 'resort', 'where', 'place', 'are', 'be', 'evaluated', 'performance', 'when', 'Martin', 'Mull', 'out', 'blackball', 'safety', 'features', 'can', 'close', 'down', 'so', 'can', 'takeover', 'ski', 'resort', 'make', 'own', 'resort', 'up', 'ski', 'resort', 'save', 'reputation', 'keep', 'open', 'funniest', 'part', 'guy', 'SUICIDE', 'guy', 'THREE', 'part', 'personality', 'when', 'snowboard', 'rocket', 'skis', 'lot', 'other', 'stunts', 'other', 'funny', 'part', 'when', 'ski', 'patrollers', 'pull', 'prank', 'instructor', 'Murray', 'so', 'short', 'give', 'growth', 'pills', 'making', 'think', 'growing', 'when', 'taking', 'movie', 'was', 'created', 'Police', 'Academy', 'producer', 'PAUL', 'MASLANSKY', 'know', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'classic', 'hope', 'will', 'become', 'DVD', 'RErelease', 'hilarious', 'resurrection', 'thing', 'movie', 'cute', 'bull', 'dog', 'DUMPSTER', 'cause', 'whenever', 'Murray', 'would', 'fall', 'down', 'dog', 'would', 'be', 'there', 'snorting', 'slobbering', 'spitting', 'everywhere', 'Anyway', 'hope', 'make', 'DVD', 'cause', 'wan', 'buy']",Ski Patrol VHS
