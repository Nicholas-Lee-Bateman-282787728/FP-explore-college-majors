1634653,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B00BHK99JU,,"[0, 0]","KILLING LINCOLN is that rare historical documentary that takes you inside history.  Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard are writing a series of books to breath life back into history. O'Reilly feels that Americans are losing touch with history and children are no longer learning the basics. Here is the documentary version of their book KILLING LINCOLN.Great lengths were taken to ensure as much accuracy as possible in KILLING LINCOLN with authentic looking costumes, locations and sets. Re-enacting a tragic moment in American history is done with the great care. Here is an amazing visual trip back in time. Actors, including Billy Campbell as Abraham Lincoln, take us through these events. Filling in pieces and explaining the history is Tom Hanks. Hanks does a truly fine job in bridging the sequence of events.KILLING LINCOLN is a great history lesson for adults and older children. Anyone fascinated with history will be intrigued by this production. I have read many books on the assassination of Abraham Lincoln so there was no new information for me but it was incredible to see the events ""live"" through historical fact. Most people know John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln in Ford's Theater but few realize this was a larger conspiracy. Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward were both on the hit list that fateful night. How many people know what transpired in Washington, D.C.,. as Lincoln was dying?Here is a visually stunning documentary that brings history to life. Campbell protrays Lincoln as a kind-hearted soft-spoken man with a strong love for his wife and sons and for his country. Maybe Lincoln is idolized and maybe he should be. April 14, 1865 became a decisive moment in American history. Nothing would be the same again.Anyone with an interest in American history should see KILLING LINCOLN. Here is the whole story and we see what happened to the conspirators. Historical records are used rather than conjecture. Was justice served in the sentences carried out on the surviving conspirators? Why did 18 pages disappear from Booth'sfinal diary?Although the extras were interesting, I wish there had been much more on the life of Abraham Lincoln and the fates of the conspirators.It was interesting to see 1865 re-created and how the actors went about their roles. O'Reilly mentions finding out that John Wilkes Booth's fiance was having an affair with Lincoln's oldest son Robert and this anger could have fueled his need to kill Abraham Lincoln. Fascinating, if true, but why not explain the evidence.A great deal of dedication and energy was given to this production of KILLING LINCOLN. It is a remarkable achievement and should been seen by all.",5,FASCINATING EDUCATIONAL ENTERTAINING HONEST,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",2013,2690,"['KILLING', 'LINCOLN', 'rare', 'historical', 'documentary', 'history', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'Martin', 'Dugard', 'are', 'writing', 'series', 'books', 'breath', 'life', 'back', 'history', ""O'Reilly"", 'Americans', 'are', 'losing', 'touch', 'history', 'children', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'learning', 'basics', 'Here', 'documentary', 'version', 'book', 'KILLING', 'LINCOLN.Great', 'lengths', 'were', 'taken', 'ensure', 'much', 'accuracy', 'possible', 'KILLING', 'LINCOLN', 'authentic', 'looking', 'costumes', 'locations', 'sets', 'Re-enacting', 'tragic', 'moment', 'American', 'history', 'done', 'great', 'care', 'Here', 'amazing', 'visual', 'trip', 'back', 'time', 'Actors', 'including', 'Billy', 'Campbell', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'take', 'events', 'Filling', 'pieces', 'explaining', 'history', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Hanks', 'truly', 'fine', 'job', 'bridging', 'sequence', 'events.KILLING', 'LINCOLN', 'great', 'history', 'lesson', 'adults', 'older', 'children', 'Anyone', 'fascinated', 'history', 'will', 'be', 'intrigued', 'production', 'have', 'read', 'many', 'books', 'assassination', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'new', 'information', 'was', 'incredible', 'see', 'events', 'live', 'historical', 'fact', 'Most', 'people', 'know', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'shot', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Ford', 'Theater', 'few', 'realize', 'was', 'larger', 'conspiracy', 'Vice', 'President', 'Johnson', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Seward', 'were', 'hit', 'list', 'fateful', 'night', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'know', 'what', 'transpired', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'dying', 'Here', 'visually', 'stunning', 'documentary', 'history', 'life', 'Campbell', 'Lincoln', 'kind-hearted', 'soft-spoken', 'man', 'strong', 'love', 'wife', 'sons', 'country', 'Maybe', 'Lincoln', 'idolized', 'maybe', 'should', 'be', 'April', '14', '1865', 'became', 'decisive', 'moment', 'American', 'history', 'Nothing', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'again.Anyone', 'interest', 'American', 'history', 'should', 'see', 'KILLING', 'LINCOLN', 'Here', 'whole', 'story', 'see', 'what', 'happened', 'conspirators', 'Historical', 'records', 'are', 'used', 'rather', 'conjecture', 'Was', 'justice', 'served', 'sentences', 'carried', 'out', 'surviving', 'conspirators', 'Why', 'did', '18', 'pages', 'disappear', ""Booth'sfinal"", 'diary', 'extras', 'were', 'interesting', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'life', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'fates', 'conspirators.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', '1865', 're-created', 'how', 'actors', 'went', 'roles', ""O'Reilly"", 'mentions', 'finding', 'out', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'fiance', 'was', 'having', 'affair', 'Lincoln', 'oldest', 'son', 'Robert', 'anger', 'could', 'have', 'fueled', 'need', 'kill', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Fascinating', 'true', 'why', 'not', 'explain', 'evidence.A', 'great', 'deal', 'dedication', 'energy', 'was', 'given', 'production', 'KILLING', 'LINCOLN', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'should', 'been', 'seen']",Killing Lincoln

1634657,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00BHK99JU,Anthony L.,"[1, 1]","Of the 44 presidents of the United States, there have been known assassination plots directed at nineteen of them. Of those, only six have actually been shot. And of those six, four were killed. The four presidents assassinated in office were: Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy.Garfield was shot by a jealous madman, and McKinley by an anarchist, but nobody really hears about Leon Czolgosz or Charles Guiteau. The mysterious and endlessly debatable assassination of beloved president John F. Kennedy bears the brunt of the conspiracy theories, ranging from the good, the bad, and the weird. But it is the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth on April 15th, 1865, that is arguably the most romanticized and famous political killing in US history.For a non-American like me, Killing Lincoln is the perfect blend of information, excellent reenactment, suspense, intrigue, and entertainment. I knew a lot about the assassination of Honest Abe BEFORE I saw the film, but I did not know what went on AFTER the actual shooting at Ford's Theatre at 10:25 AM, April 15th. It turns out that I only knew half the story. The most compelling part of the conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln was, arguably, not Lincoln's actual assassination. It was the slow lead up to it, the conspiratorial meetings, the building obsession of actor John Wilkes Booth, the relatively unknown plan to assassinate Secretary of State William Seward and Vice-President Andrew Johnson (both of which failed), Booth's dramatic escape, the valiant effort of doctors and surgeons to keep Lincoln alive, Booth's hideout and retrospective final days, and his anti-climactic death.Killing Lincoln(based on the book of the same name) may be dramatized to the point of sensationalization, it may be somewhat simplified (though I wouldn't know), it may get some of the details wrong, but it is a well-rounded and brilliantly dramatized portrait of the final days of the most loved president in US History, and one of the most compelling characters in the annals of political crime.If they had acting Oscars for documentaries, Killing Lincoln would surely win a boatload.Billy Campbellgives the most perfect portrayal of Abraham Lincoln I have ever seen, and this includes Daniel Day-Lewis's incredible performance inLincoln. Day-Lewis played Lincoln as a man, full of faults and shortcomings; at times unsure of himself, but with a strong moral compass and as the brilliant manipulator and motivator he was. But Billy Campbell portrays him as the brilliant leader, the eloquent speaker, the devoted president, the humble man, the loving father and husband, and noble but conflicted soul that we all picture and remember him to be. Campbell's is an incredibly dignified, noble, and moving portrayal of the 16th President, and if he provides the heart and soul of the film, then Jesse Johnson as John Wilkes Booth gives the fiery spirit.Johnson is absolutely electrifying as the theatrical and controversial, often mythical man who murdered Abraham Lincoln. Renowned actor, hot-blooded patriot, fervent speaker, brilliant manipulator, charismatic, grandiose, obsessive, conflicted, sympathetic...these are the adjectives that describe the 26 year-old John Wilkes Booth. Jesse Johnson chews the scenery and steals the film with his fiery, fervent acting and brilliant portrayal of Booth. The audience feels simultaneously repulsed, intrigued, sympathetic, and related to the man. From his stunning entrance, Johnson does nothing less than rivet and enthrall the entire film. His is a complex performance, but a sympathetic one. This is the finest Booth ever put to screen, and one of the most memorable antiheroes in recent cinema. You may begin feeling distanced and repulsed by him, but by the end, you cannot help but feel sorry for Booth. He thought he would be a hero like Brutus - slayer of a tyrant, but he has gone down in history as one of the most one-dimensional villains of all time.ProducersRidleyandTony Scott(RIP Tony. You will be missed) and presenter/narrator Tom Hanks seek to change that. They want to explore the true facts and circumstances that led up to Lincoln's assassination, and the the final days of John Wilkes Booth. Not satisfied with ending there, they further explore Booth's co-conspirators and their fates and demises. With historical accuracy, excellent costumes and cinematography, amazing period-accurate dialogues and stunning re-enactments, they have created one of the finest historical documentary films in recent years: Killing Lincoln.My rating? Four and a half Colt Derringers out of Five.P.S. Check out Steven Spielberg's excellent, Oscar-winning, all-star biopicLincoln. Daniel Day-Lewis gives one of his finest performances as the eponymous president. Sadly, the film does not go into any detail of Lincoln's assassination. Watch or read Killing Lincoln for that.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[51, 56]","KILLING LINCOLN (Narr./Hosted Tom Hanks, 2013, 120 minutes, for the History Channel and National Geographic) is a deeply enjoyable reenactor's fondest dream. With a stunningly handsome fellow portraying John Wilkes Booth, this documentary lays out the most complex issues leading up to Booth's assassination of our 16th president skillfully.Tom Hanks offers an almost academic, pitch-perfect narration seated near a nice old table, the way Alastair Cooke used to do Masterpiece Theater introductions. (No fireplace though.) With reenactments and commentary by scholars, this is actually a well rendered educational work. I do not care for education-via-reenactment, as I state every time I get a chance. I think it is tawdry, stupid, badly done, nothing more than a stepping stone for whatever it is stepping on the stones.Here it is done with panache and respect for Lincoln. While I know this is a total tie-in for Steven Spielberg'sLincoln, and I do not begrudge anyone that advantage, this documentary has a zest and accuracy that I really enjoyed. I even loved the man who reenacted the presidential photographer Alexander Gardener, who is the same man who reenacted him in a couple of other Lincoln documentaries from this year and last year.It was just a bit disappointing that the actor who did Lincoln for all of NatGeo's documentaries wasn't in evidence here ... at least I don't think that was him. But then the emphasis is totally on Booth, not on Lincoln at all. If you wish to see the truth as well as know it, or hear it spoken as they probably did at the time, this is your documentary. It ought to be shown at schools, and Tom Hanks deserves some kind of Emmy for his presentation/narration.The Great Hanks, who is half Portuguese, is also a cousin of Lincoln. I realized this because it is my job to know: the Hanks Family became famous for a short while because they reminisced about Lincoln after he was assassinated. Dennis Hanks, Lincoln's first cousin who grew up with him, did a lot of the talking. Tom Hanks is Lincoln's third cousin four times removed.Now if I could only learn about Hanks' Portuguese relatives! I have always wondered if Hanks is Jewish ... and his mother's maiden name, Fraga, suggests Sephardic roots. Hanks was Catholic, later converting to Eastern Orthodoxy.",5,"Booth the murderer, Hanks rides again, the sad story behind the end of Abraham Lincoln",1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,2306,"['KILLING', 'LINCOLN', 'Narr./Hosted', 'Tom', 'Hanks', '2013', '120', 'minutes', 'History', 'Channel', 'National', 'Geographic', 'deeply', 'enjoyable', 'reenactor', 'fondest', 'dream', 'stunningly', 'handsome', 'fellow', 'portraying', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'documentary', 'out', 'most', 'complex', 'issues', 'leading', 'up', 'Booth', 'assassination', '16th', 'president', 'skillfully.Tom', 'Hanks', 'almost', 'academic', 'pitch-perfect', 'narration', 'seated', 'nice', 'old', 'table', 'way', 'Alastair', 'Cooke', 'used', 'do', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'introductions', 'fireplace', 'reenactments', 'commentary', 'scholars', 'actually', 'well', 'rendered', 'educational', 'work', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'education-via-reenactment', 'state', 'time', 'get', 'chance', 'think', 'tawdry', 'stupid', 'badly', 'done', 'nothing', 'more', 'stepping', 'stone', 'whatever', 'stepping', 'stones.Here', 'done', 'panache', 'respect', 'Lincoln', 'know', 'total', 'tie-in', 'Steven', ""Spielberg'sLincoln"", 'do', 'not', 'begrudge', 'anyone', 'advantage', 'documentary', 'zest', 'accuracy', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'loved', 'man', 'who', 'reenacted', 'presidential', 'photographer', 'Alexander', 'Gardener', 'who', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'reenacted', 'couple', 'other', 'Lincoln', 'documentaries', 'year', 'last', 'year.It', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'actor', 'who', 'did', 'Lincoln', 'NatGeo', 'documentaries', 'was', ""n't"", 'evidence', 'here', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'then', 'emphasis', 'totally', 'Booth', 'not', 'Lincoln', 'wish', 'see', 'truth', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'hear', 'spoken', 'probably', 'did', 'time', 'documentary', 'ought', 'be', 'shown', 'schools', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'kind', 'Emmy', 'presentation/narration.The', 'Great', 'Hanks', 'who', 'Portuguese', 'also', 'cousin', 'Lincoln', 'realized', 'job', 'know', 'Hanks', 'Family', 'became', 'famous', 'short', 'while', 'reminisced', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'assassinated', 'Dennis', 'Hanks', 'Lincoln', 'first', 'cousin', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'did', 'lot', 'talking', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Lincoln', 'third', 'cousin', 'four', 'times', 'removed.Now', 'could', 'only', 'learn', 'Hanks', 'Portuguese', 'relatives', 'have', 'always', 'wondered', 'Hanks', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'maiden', 'name', 'Fraga', 'Sephardic', 'roots', 'Hanks', 'was', 'Catholic', 'later', 'converting', 'Eastern', 'Orthodoxy']",Killing Lincoln

That was an interesting approach, particularly for history buffs, but it was a clash of different styles when compared to the exaggerated acting by the principle cast members.

His snarling and hand gesturing reminded me of the TV cartoon character, Snidely Whiplash of many years ago.  I'd have preferred to see Booth as a tormented individual along the lines of Hamlet or Macbeth.The actor who played Lincoln had a tough act to follow, because of Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" having been in theaters so recently.  Daniel D. Lewis's portrayal of Lincoln in that movie should seal that character away on the shelves for decades to come.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 2]","This hybrid docudrama/documentary on Abraham's Lincolns last days and his assassin, actor John Wilkes Booth was made for television and apparently was broadcast on either the History Channel or the National Geographic Channel earlier this year and is now on home video on DVD and Blu-ray. This is a review of the BD edition.Based on the book by TV commentator Bill O'Reilly (and Martin Dugard), and executive produced by directors Ridley Scott and Tony Scott (neither of who directed it), the 96 minute film (listed incorrectly by Amazon at 120 minutes) tries to tell the story using new information unearthed by the authors and - as you will hear, way too many times. In the ""bonus Features"" the director wanted this to be as accurate as possible, down to the makeup on everyone in the film, including those that surrounded Lincoln on his death bed. He even made an exact replica of the gun the Booth used.Whether you feel that actor Billy Campbell has the right build and voice for Lincoln will have to be your own decision. For my taste, Daniel Day Lewis nailed it in Steven Spielberg's recent film ""Lincoln"". But we need to remember that there are no recordings of Lincoln's voice; Edison had not yet invented the phonograph!There are already other reviews here so I'll try not to duplicate their info. I put  the disc in my BD player without knowing anything except that the film was about Lincoln and Booth. It starts with no opening credits and we see Booth shooting the president. (The rest is really flashback). So I assumed it was a docudrama. Then about five minutes into the film Tom Hanks appears - not as an actor in costume, but as a narrator, and - for some reason , he is facing to your right. Anyway he tells you how many days Lincoln has to live. And, he returns periodically to give a bit more info and tell you ""again"" how many days Lincoln has left at that point. I really found this distracting, as did another reviewer.So as for the film, it was okay and it does tell the story.The BD is loaded with LOTS of special features. First there is the full-length commentary by the screenwriter (I have not listened to that). Then there are the following:Interview with O'Reilly - approx.  5 minutesUncovering The Truth: the Making of Killing Lincoln - 22 minutesA series of five ""promotional"" features including the music  Costume, Production design, etc.And finally an ad to visit Virginia (17 seconds!!)O'Reilly has also written a book titled ""Killing Kennedy"" and that film is finished but hasn't aired. And he just signed an agreement with the National Geographic Channel for a film titled ""Killing Jesus"". So there are more ""Killings"" to come.Yes, I learned more about John Wilkes Booth than I learned in school, but this film didn't ""excite"" me as Spielberg's film did! I guess it's all how you ""look"" at history.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",3,"Docudrama about Lincoln and Booth with Tom Hanks as ""annoying"" narrator. - Review of Bluray",1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,2928,"['hybrid', 'docudrama/documentary', 'Abraham', 'Lincolns', 'last', 'days', 'assassin', 'actor', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'apparently', 'was', 'broadcast', 'History', 'Channel', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Channel', 'earlier', 'year', 'now', 'home', 'video', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'review', 'BD', 'edition.Based', 'book', 'TV', 'commentator', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'Martin', 'Dugard', 'executive', 'produced', 'directors', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'who', 'directed', '96', 'minute', 'film', 'listed', 'incorrectly', 'Amazon', '120', 'minutes', 'tries', 'tell', 'story', 'using', 'new', 'information', 'unearthed', 'authors', 'will', 'hear', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'bonus', 'Features', 'director', 'wanted', 'be', 'as', 'accurate', 'possible', 'down', 'makeup', 'everyone', 'film', 'including', 'surrounded', 'Lincoln', 'death', 'bed', 'even', 'made', 'exact', 'replica', 'gun', 'Booth', 'feel', 'actor', 'Billy', 'Campbell', 'right', 'build', 'voice', 'Lincoln', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'own', 'decision', 'taste', 'Daniel', 'Day', 'Lewis', 'nailed', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'recent', 'film', 'Lincoln', 'need', 'remember', 'are', 'recordings', 'Lincoln', 'voice', 'Edison', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'invented', 'phonograph', 'are', 'already', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'so', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'duplicate', 'info', 'put', 'disc', 'BD', 'player', 'knowing', 'anything', 'film', 'was', 'Lincoln', 'Booth', 'opening', 'credits', 'see', 'shooting', 'president', 'rest', 'really', 'flashback', 'assumed', 'was', 'docudrama', 'Then', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'not', 'actor', 'costume', 'narrator', 'reason', 'facing', 'right', 'Anyway', 'how', 'many', 'days', 'Lincoln', 'live', 'periodically', 'give', 'bit', 'more', 'info', 'tell', 'again', 'how', 'many', 'days', 'Lincoln', 'left', 'point', 'really', 'found', 'distracting', 'did', 'reviewer.So', 'film', 'was', 'okay', 'tell', 'story.The', 'BD', 'loaded', 'LOTS', 'special', 'features', 'First', 'full-length', 'commentary', 'screenwriter', 'have', 'not', 'listened', 'Then', 'are', 'following', 'Interview', ""O'Reilly"", 'approx', '5', 'minutesUncovering', 'Truth', 'Making', 'Killing', 'Lincoln', '22', 'minutesA', 'series', 'five', 'promotional', 'features', 'including', 'music', 'Costume', 'Production', 'design', 'etc.And', 'finally', 'ad', 'visit', 'Virginia', '17', 'seconds', ""O'Reilly"", 'also', 'written', 'book', 'titled', 'Killing', 'Kennedy', 'film', 'finished', ""n't"", 'aired', 'just', 'signed', 'agreement', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Channel', 'film', 'titled', 'Killing', 'Jesus', 'are', 'more', 'Killings', 'come.Yes', 'learned', 'more', 'John', 'Wilkes', 'Booth', 'learned', 'school', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'excite', 'Spielberg', 'film', 'did', 'guess', 'how', 'look', 'history.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",Killing Lincoln

It goes in to detail on how the men plotted to kill Lincoln and two other men one was Andrew Johnson.

In real life John Wilkes Booth (Jesse Johnson) was an actor, in this film he left a lot to be desired. The movie starts in the days/months before the assassination and goes up to the death of the assassins. It includes narration by Tom Hanks, who wisely didn't play any roles. Unfortunately the narration added very little to the film, other than make it annoying. Why narrate what is on the screen?There were boring scenes of Booth writing a letter. The dialouge was dry toast. The ending with Booth saying &#34;kill me&#34; as he laid helpless would invoked images of the ultra-liberal book/film &#34;Johnny Got His Gun.&#34; Really Bill, that was an influence on you?I almost turned it off after 10 minutes.
