Fairbanks""","[7, 9]","The second film in which Elvis plays a character named Walter (the first was ""Kid Galahad"", ""The Trouble With Girls"" is a snooze, but a worthy  addition to the King's filmography if only because it represents a complete  change of pace from most of his other 1960's vehicles.  Set in the 1920s,  he's the manager of a  travelling tent show rocked by assorted scandals,  and he's surrounded by a cast of solid professionals (Vincent Price appears  in a cameo).  Slim, relaxed, and impeccably dressedin a white suit,  Elvis looks better here than he has in a decade, and it's no wonder.  By  the time this film entered production, the TV special that would represent  his return from the ashes of low-budget Hollywood pap, was already in the  can, and he had only one more movie to go (""Change of Habit"") before  bidding adieu to the film capital that saw him as nothing more than bait to  reel in an often undiscriminating teenaged audience.",2,"A snooze, but a change of pace for Presley",928108800,"05 31, 1999",1999,940,"['second', 'film', 'Elvis', 'character', 'named', 'Walter', 'first', 'was', 'Kid', 'Galahad', 'Trouble', 'Girls', 'snooze', 'worthy', 'addition', 'King', 'filmography', 'only', 'complete', 'change', 'pace', 'most', 'other', '1960', 'vehicles', 'Set', '1920s', 'manager', 'travelling', 'tent', 'show', 'rocked', 'assorted', 'scandals', 'surrounded', 'cast', 'solid', 'professionals', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'cameo', 'Slim', 'relaxed', 'impeccably', 'dressedin', 'white', 'suit', 'Elvis', 'better', 'here', 'decade', 'wonder', 'time', 'film', 'entered', 'production', 'TV', 'special', 'would', 'represent', 'return', 'ashes', 'low-budget', 'Hollywood', 'pap', 'was', 'already', 'can', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'more', 'movie', 'go', 'Change', 'Habit', 'bidding', 'adieu', 'film', 'capital', 'saw', 'nothing', 'more', 'bait', 'reel', 'often', 'undiscriminating', 'teenaged', 'audience']",The Trouble with Girls VHS
288322,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6301978617,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","A fun musical comedy, THE TROUBLE WITH GIRLS isn't the usual Elvis Presley film but it's completely charming with it's faithful period recreation and fine supporting cast.Presley plays Walter Hale, manager of the traveling ""Chautauqua"" tent-show, circa. 1927, who gets mixed up in the lives of the residents of the latest town to host the show.  Hale finds himself falling in love with Charlene (Marlyn Mason), organiser of the children's activities; whilst trying to help local single mother Nita Bix (Sheree North) when she murders her nasty married boyfriend (Dabney Coleman).  Presley's numbers include ""Swing Down Sweet Chariot"" and ""Clean Up Your Own Backyard"".It's certainly a lot better than some of the other Elvis films from the same period; and seeing Elvis in a more traditional musical is a great treat.  Marlyn Mason, probably one of Presley's most formidable leading-ladies, is stunning (and her rendition of ""Sign of the Zodiac"" is a knockout).  Nicole Jaffe (as the amorous hotel clerk), Vincent Price (eccentric speaker ""Mr Morality""), John Carradine (as a colourful Shakespearian actor), Joyce van Patten (disgruntled former channel swimmer Maude) and Edward Andrews (as Hale's beleaguered assistant) are also fine.  Fans of classic TV shows should keep an eye out for Anissa Jones (""Family Affair"") and Susan Olsen (""The Brady Bunch"").",4,refreshing new Elvis musical,1147478400,"05 13, 2006",2006,1355,"['fun', 'musical', 'comedy', 'THE', 'TROUBLE', 'WITH', 'GIRLS', ""n't"", 'usual', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'film', 'completely', 'charming', 'faithful', 'period', 'recreation', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast.Presley', 'plays', 'Walter', 'Hale', 'manager', 'traveling', 'Chautauqua', 'tent-show', 'circa', '1927', 'who', 'mixed', 'up', 'lives', 'residents', 'latest', 'town', 'host', 'show', 'Hale', 'falling', 'love', 'Charlene', 'Marlyn', 'Mason', 'organiser', 'children', 'activities', 'whilst', 'trying', 'help', 'local', 'single', 'mother', 'Nita', 'Bix', 'Sheree', 'North', 'when', 'nasty', 'married', 'boyfriend', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'Presley', 'numbers', 'include', 'Swing', 'Down', 'Sweet', 'Chariot', 'Clean', 'Up', 'Own', 'Backyard', '.It', 'certainly', 'lot', 'better', 'other', 'Elvis', 'films', 'same', 'period', 'seeing', 'Elvis', 'more', 'traditional', 'musical', 'great', 'treat', 'Marlyn', 'Mason', 'probably', 'one', 'Presley', 'most', 'formidable', 'leading-ladies', 'stunning', 'rendition', 'Sign', 'Zodiac', 'knockout', 'Nicole', 'Jaffe', 'amorous', 'hotel', 'clerk', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'eccentric', 'speaker', 'Mr', 'Morality', 'John', 'Carradine', 'colourful', 'Shakespearian', 'actor', 'Joyce', 'van', 'Patten', 'disgruntled', 'former', 'channel', 'swimmer', 'Maude', 'Edward', 'Andrews', 'Hale', 'beleaguered', 'assistant', 'are', 'also', 'fine', 'Fans', 'classic', 'TV', 'shows', 'should', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'Anissa', 'Jones', 'Family', 'Affair', 'Susan', 'Olsen', 'Brady', 'Bunch']",The Trouble with Girls VHS

I love him in all of his movies (big fan, here) but let's face it. He's a cornball in most of his movies. Most of his movies. Not Live a little, Love a little. And Definitely not this one. Elvis might be at his absolute coolest in this one. The story is entertaining, but it's one that you need to watch all the way through in order to enjoy; miss a few spots, and you'll lose interest. Big deal, though. Make your snacks in advance, go potty, then sit down and watch the movie from beginning to finish. You'll be given a treat as far as the story goes, but then you'll get a bonus: Elvis singing Clean Up Your Own Backyard. For this scene alone, the movie is definitely worth the price. The song is cool, and Elvis is just so damn laid back singin' a little Rockabilly...and the camerawork for this song is totally socks. It really is.It's not a typical Elvis movie like Worlds Fair or Girl Happy or Spinout or even Paradise, Hawaiian Style.

288325,A3NJXCGCLNU808,6301978617,Jeff Smith,"[32, 32]","The Trouble With Girls was a pleasant change of pace for Elvis, who had long grown weary of the typical formula flicks, regardless of how well they did at the box office.The light comedy had a good story to it, and the 1927 setting was great. Elvis is the manager of the traveling Chautauqua, and he blends in well with the rest of the performers, highlighted by Vincent Price, Dabney Coleman and John Carradine.It was nice to see the movie not centered totally around Elvis' singing, although his rendition of &quot;Swing Down Sweet Chariot&quot; was really motivating. &quot;Clean up Your Own Back Yard&quot; was a great song as well, especially when compared to some stinkers he had done in recent movies.I read where they were originally going to call the movie &quot;The Chautauqua.&quot; They should have done so. I agree with another reviewer who said &quot;The Trouble With Girls,&quot; is a deceiving title, making people think it's an &quot;Elvis&quot; movie. This has indeed made it one of his more forgotten and underappreciated efforts. Elvis was in the best physical shape of his life, having come off of the filming of his comeback special, he obviously enjoyed making a different type of movie, and he put more effort into it knowing that his comeback to the stage was just over the horizon once he finished filming &quot;Change of Habit.&quot;And we even see Elvis smoking a cigar. To my knowledge, that is the only time Elvis was seen smoking on screen. Definitely a change from his squeaky clean image from the &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; days.See this movie. It won't win any awards, but it lets Elvis fans see him in a different light as his movie career came to an end.",4,A pleasant change of pace for Elvis,1007942400,"12 10, 2001",2001,1687,"['Trouble', 'Girls', 'was', 'pleasant', 'change', 'pace', 'Elvis', 'who', 'had', 'long', 'grown', 'weary', 'typical', 'formula', 'flicks', 'regardless', 'how', 'well', 'did', 'box', 'office.The', 'light', 'comedy', 'had', 'good', 'story', '1927', 'setting', 'was', 'great', 'Elvis', 'manager', 'traveling', 'Chautauqua', 'well', 'rest', 'performers', 'highlighted', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'John', 'Carradine.It', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'centered', 'totally', 'Elvis', 'singing', 'rendition', 'quot', 'Swing', 'Down', 'Sweet', 'Chariot', 'quot', 'was', 'really', 'motivating', 'quot', 'Clean', 'Own', 'Back', 'Yard', 'quot', 'was', 'great', 'song', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'stinkers', 'had', 'done', 'recent', 'movies.I', 'read', 'where', 'were', 'originally', 'going', 'call', 'movie', 'quot', 'Chautauqua.', 'quot', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'so', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'quot', 'Trouble', 'Girls', 'quot', 'deceiving', 'title', 'making', 'people', 'think', 'quot', 'Elvis', 'quot', 'movie', 'indeed', 'made', 'one', 'more', 'forgotten', 'underappreciated', 'efforts', 'Elvis', 'was', 'best', 'physical', 'shape', 'life', 'having', 'come', 'filming', 'comeback', 'special', 'obviously', 'enjoyed', 'making', 'different', 'type', 'movie', 'put', 'more', 'effort', 'knowing', 'comeback', 'stage', 'was', 'just', 'horizon', 'once', 'finished', 'filming', 'quot', 'Change', 'Habit.', 'quot', 'even', 'see', 'Elvis', 'smoking', 'cigar', 'knowledge', 'only', 'time', 'Elvis', 'was', 'seen', 'smoking', 'screen', 'Definitely', 'change', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'image', 'quot', 'Blue', 'Hawaii', 'quot', 'days.See', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'Elvis', 'fans', 'see', 'different', 'light', 'movie', 'career', 'came', 'end']",The Trouble with Girls VHS

Mainly when the local pharmacist played by Dabney Coleman is murdered, and efforts are made to track the killer down. Sounds like a mystery. Elvis finally solves the mystery and has caught the crook who definetly needed to sober up.

This is not a cheap film. There were over 400 extras used, lots of special effects, and lots of costumes. By the way, what the heck is Marlyn Mason saying to Elvis when the firecrackers go off?

By the opening credits, you already know everyone meant business in making this film; from the costuming to production values to writing to acting to budget). This is no ""Stay Away, Joe!""Interestingly, Elvis is completely relaxed in a way he rarely seems to be in the bulk of his films from the mid-to-late sixties. He's a little rougher around the edges (a newfound love of cigars), but it all works. He's both invested and confident (perhaps knowing he was soon to depart to a new phase of his career after his '68 Comeback Special). Upon watching this particular film, one might agree Elvis certainly could have handled the acting gravitas needed to pull off ""A Star is Born"" in 1975, perhaps very realistically garnering his first Oscar nomination. Sadly, it wasn't to be.But, ""The Trouble with Girls"", along with ""Wild in the Country"" (1961), and ""King Creole"" (1958), feature an Elvis where, upon watching, it's hard to remember how anyone could have viewed him as a poor actor. Of course, all three of these films share common variables: serious actors, talented direction, a tight script, and invested professionals from art design cinematography to costumes.If none of that is enough, it's worth mentioning Elvis is better looking than a thousand movie stars in this film. He is at his physical and charismatic peak in 1969.A great little, sadly too-forgotten, film.",5,Top-Notch All the Way,1219622400,"08 25, 2008",2008,1566,"['had', 'been', 'years', 'seeing', 'Trouble', 'Girls', 'remembered', 'was', 'only', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'film', 'father', 'actually', 'liked', 'grinned', 'ear', 'ear', 'belly', 'laughing', 'opening', 'credits', 'already', 'know', 'everyone', 'meant', 'business', 'making', 'film', 'costuming', 'production', 'values', 'writing', 'acting', 'budget', 'Stay', 'Away', 'Joe', 'Interestingly', 'Elvis', 'completely', 'relaxed', 'way', 'rarely', 'be', 'bulk', 'films', 'mid-to-late', 'sixties', 'little', 'rougher', 'edges', 'newfound', 'love', 'cigars', 'works', 'invested', 'confident', 'perhaps', 'knowing', 'was', 'soon', 'depart', 'new', 'phase', 'career', ""'68"", 'Comeback', 'Special', 'watching', 'particular', 'film', 'one', 'might', 'agree', 'Elvis', 'certainly', 'could', 'have', 'handled', 'acting', 'gravitas', 'needed', 'pull', 'off', 'A', 'Star', 'Born', '1975', 'perhaps', 'very', 'realistically', 'garnering', 'first', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Sadly', 'was', ""n't"", 'be.But', 'Trouble', 'Girls', 'Wild', 'Country', '1961', 'King', 'Creole', '1958', 'feature', 'Elvis', 'where', 'watching', 'hard', 'remember', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'have', 'viewed', 'poor', 'actor', 'course', 'three', 'films', 'share', 'common', 'variables', 'serious', 'actors', 'talented', 'direction', 'tight', 'script', 'invested', 'professionals', 'art', 'design', 'cinematography', 'costumes.If', 'none', 'enough', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Elvis', 'better', 'looking', 'thousand', 'movie', 'stars', 'film', 'physical', 'charismatic', 'peak', '1969.A', 'great', 'little', 'sadly', 'too-forgotten', 'film']",The Trouble with Girls VHS
