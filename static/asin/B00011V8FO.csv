790629,AG2XKBC4ABIWP,B00011V8FO,Babycakes,"[32, 32]","I was enchanted and pleasantly surprised by this film. It is the story of a young woman who develops amnesia following an accident, and is brought home afterwards by her young, handsome, successful husband, who acts cold and distant to her. She later learns they have been sleeping in separate bedrooms for years, and are facing a pending divorce. She cannot get anyone, not even the psychiatrist who treated her both before and after the accident, to share with her why her once-happy marriage fell apart, or why she became abusive to her husband's adolescent sister who lives with them. Then there is the mystery of the dangerous-looking man in the old car who appears to be stalking her.I found both of the main stars to be subtle and believable in their roles. Peter Outerbridge, as the husband, is cautious and coolly courteous, with an underlying sadness and perhaps just a touch of hope that their once happy relationship can yet be restored. Justine Bateman's character is fragile and frightened, and most anxious to win over her forgotten family. Little bits of memories fall into place as she views photo albums, hears stories about the past, and visits familiar places. She falls in love with her husband all over again, and becomes a dear friend to his little sister, but still cannot remember all the details of her former life, and the event or events that transformed her into the monster that she apparently became in the years just before the accident.I have seen hundreds of mystery and romance movies, and read hundreds of books. But the climax during which Justine Bateman's character learns the truth about her past, while not exactly earth-shattering, caught me completely by surprise. This film left me feeling upbeat and warm and fuzzy, with a renewed hope in the power of forgiveness.",5,Touching & Suspenseful Romantic Movie,1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,1809,"['was', 'enchanted', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'film', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'amnesia', 'following', 'accident', 'brought', 'home', 'afterwards', 'young', 'handsome', 'successful', 'husband', 'who', 'cold', 'distant', 'later', 'have', 'been', 'sleeping', 'separate', 'bedrooms', 'years', 'are', 'facing', 'pending', 'divorce', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'anyone', 'not', 'even', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'treated', 'accident', 'share', 'why', 'once-happy', 'marriage', 'fell', 'apart', 'why', 'became', 'abusive', 'husband', 'adolescent', 'sister', 'who', 'Then', 'mystery', 'dangerous-looking', 'man', 'old', 'car', 'who', 'be', 'stalking', 'her.I', 'found', 'main', 'stars', 'be', 'subtle', 'believable', 'roles', 'Peter', 'Outerbridge', 'husband', 'cautious', 'coolly', 'courteous', 'underlying', 'sadness', 'perhaps', 'just', 'touch', 'hope', 'once', 'happy', 'relationship', 'can', 'yet', 'be', 'restored', 'Justine', 'Bateman', 'character', 'fragile', 'frightened', 'most', 'anxious', 'win', 'over', 'forgotten', 'family', 'Little', 'bits', 'memories', 'fall', 'place', 'photo', 'albums', 'hears', 'stories', 'past', 'visits', 'familiar', 'places', 'love', 'husband', 'over', 'again', 'dear', 'friend', 'little', 'sister', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'details', 'former', 'life', 'event', 'events', 'transformed', 'monster', 'apparently', 'became', 'years', 'just', 'accident.I', 'have', 'seen', 'hundreds', 'mystery', 'romance', 'movies', 'read', 'hundreds', 'books', 'climax', 'Justine', 'Bateman', 'character', 'truth', 'past', 'not', 'exactly', 'earth-shattering', 'caught', 'completely', 'surprise', 'film', 'left', 'feeling', 'upbeat', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'renewed', 'hope', 'power', 'forgiveness']",Another Woman
790630,A35IAFK3FDWNNA,B00011V8FO,Carol W.,"[0, 0]",I saw this several years ago on TV and  wanted to buy it.  It's an excellent movie and Justine Bateman does an excellent job. My only negative comment would be that they added a nude scene at the beach with other actors who looked similar to them. We could have done without that!  It did not enhance the movie and the performers did not look like Justine Bateman or her husband. Otherwise a really goood movie.,5,Excellent Harlequin Movie,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,411,"['saw', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'TV', 'wanted', 'buy', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Justine', 'Bateman', 'excellent', 'job', 'only', 'negative', 'comment', 'would', 'be', 'added', 'nude', 'scene', 'beach', 'other', 'actors', 'who', 'looked', 'similar', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'did', 'not', 'enhance', 'movie', 'performers', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'Justine', 'Bateman', 'husband', 'Otherwise', 'really', 'goood', 'movie']",Another Woman
