Even the VHS version of this movie is better than this. Also it seems that it was transferred not from the master tapes, but from Vhs stockpile with bad digital noise at times. But since its finally on DVD , I'll take it, but I'm not very happy with the digital noise artifacts, it makes the movie look , almost cartoonish in darker areas. I'm hoping for a second better release (though i doubt it) and hopefully a blu ray release that is done right. I don't really mind that its full screen, that doesn't bother too much. I'm more concerned with the picture quality. Also there is no trailer for this movie, but trailers for other movies. Also the case it came in is very flimsy.

A perfect 5.1 DVD has music in the first channel, sound effects with some dialog in the second, everything mixed together in the third, track 4 is base, and the last two channels are for rear sounds, sometimes containing a clearer isolated music track.

190424,A2CT2SA6KFE8GC,1573625086,"Stanley Runk ""Runkdapunk""","[2, 3]","I've never been much for Keanu Reeves.  I'd always thought the guy was a throwaway schmuck who somehow got lucky and impressed the right people to get to where he is today.  Not to mention a lousy actor!  Can anyone honestly buy Reeves as an Englishman(in Bram Stoker's Dracula) or a southern lawyer(in The Devil's Advocate)?  Then someone got the hot idea of trying to make Reeves into some kind of action star like in Point Break, Speed and The Matrix!  I don't know who thought this was a good idea, but Reeves is as convincing playing a tough guy or cop as he would be playing Cab Calloway.But it's not so much Reeves' fault, he just isn't put in the right roles.  That's where the Night Before comes in.  This is the ultimate Keanu reeves film.  I used to watch it over and over back when it was constantly played on HBO.  I even had the one sheet poster hanging in my bedroom at one time!It's the best acting Reeves has ever done.  Why?  Because he's totally believable in this role.  This dorky kind of character is what Reeves is born to play.  He's so good in this, he carries the whole film.  Bill & Ted is a close second, and I'll give the guy credit, he was good in River's Edge.  But this is Reeves' masterpiece.It's kinda like a lighter version of Scorsese's After Hours.  Reeves is high school nerd, Winston Connelly.  He wakes up in an alley in a slum part of L.A. and can't remember how he got there.  As he wanders around the streets and has run ins with various characters, bit by bit he remembers what had happened earlier that night.  He had taken the most popular girl in school, Tara, to the prom(she had lost a bet with her friend and as the loser, she had to go to the prom with the school geek.  It's funny coz she pretty much tells Winston this flat out, but he either doesn't care or is too dumb to understand the situation), but through a series of goofy events, he ended up selling her to a pimp and winding up on that pimp's hit list.  Now Winston must find Tara in the wee hours of the morning before he ends up dead, either at the hands of the angry pimp, or Tara's detective father.  During his quest he meets a bunch of odd characters, including a helpful prostitute played by Teresa Saldana.  A subplot appears to have been cut from the film.  I think the idea is that Winston had had sex with Saldana's character the night before, as she hints at this when we first see her.  Plus, I remember the plot description on the back of the VHS box saying that Winston had lost his date, his car, and his virginity all in one night!  Oh, well, it woulda been cool.  I know I'd do Teresa Saldana(and Lori Loughlin for that matter).  In the club scenes we're treated to George Clinton, Bootsy Collins and the P-Funk All stars.  In fact, it's because of this movie that I even know of George Clinton.  If I hadn't had seen The Night Before, I'd probably never had bought a Parliament or Funkadelic album.  They have some awesome songs for the film.  If anyone knows if these songs are available on cd, please let me know.By the end of the night, Winston has gone through a period of self discovery and has become a tougher and more confident guy.  Not to mention Tara now has the hots for him!This is quite the entertaining movie.  I gave it five stars, mostly due to childhood nostalgia, but this film is actually pretty good.  I'm surprised it never became more popular.  Again, Reeves is terrific in this part.  This is a part he was born to play, and as absurd as many of the situations are, he's believable as this character.  Even when he becomes more of a tough guy throughout the night, it really works coz he's so clumsy when trying to be a hero.  Lori Loughlin is a snotty little turd, but man, is she a cutie.The film was directed by Thom Eberhardt, who also made the quirky and fun, Night of the Comet.It's great that Lionsgate has released a batch of ""lost"" films of the 80s, I hope to see more released over time.  The DVD is pretty much bare bones except for an optional Trivia Track which is very disappointing because it barely pertains to the movie at all!  I was hoping for some cool The Night Before fun facts, but it was all lame-o information.  But it is still great to finally have this one out on DVD.
