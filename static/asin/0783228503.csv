Peoples names probably were changed when entering Ellis Island, whatever it took to get into this land.  There were ruthless people who preyed on ths immigrants, and their lack of knowledge about America.  But this is what the immigration experience was all about, it certainly was not a pleasant situation.The cartoons emphasis is on the russian emigres, and their experiences matched what happened to the other new arrivals.

61266,ANGH6401L9Y0T,0783228503,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","Fievel Mouskawitz and his family emigrate to America because in their native Russia the Cossack cats menace them while the Cossacks menace the Muscowitz family of humans under whose porch they live. But Fievel gets lost from the rest of his family during a giant storm that looks like Neptune himself has gotten angry.Fievel survived the storm in a bottle, although even he apparently did not know how he got into the bottle. He washes up on the plinth of the Statue of Liberty, which is being built by a French seagull. (OK, then Siegel. We get a lot of Jewish jokes in here, without ever once actually saying they are Jewish.) The seagull admonishes him to ""never say never"" when he gets discouraged about ever being able to find his family, and then recruits some French floozy pigeons (passenger pigeons?) to carry Fievel to the mainland.Fievel is a very appealing little guy, with a totally cute way, cute voice, cute everything. You may get a little tired of cute by the time the film is over. Fievel's father had told him that there were no cats in America, but they found early on that it was not true. So even though they come close to each other several times, we follow the adventures of Fievel on the one hand and the rest of his family on the other as they become involved in a plot to get rid of the cats in New York.He meets Tony, a street-wise Italian-American mouse who nicknames him Philly, and they go off to try to find his family. They hear an Irish colleen mouse speaking out from a platform which is actually a straw boater hat as she tries to rouse the mice to work together to get rid of the cats. That was the first Fievel learned that there were indeed cats in America. Meanwhile, Tony falls hopelessly in love with the colleen, and rather neglects poor Fievel.Once again, it's too much fun to ruin it by telling you too much of the plot. Things get a little syrupy here and there, but you will love where the voices of Madeleine Kahn and Dom DeLouise show up. I didn't recognize the names of any of the others, but you can't miss those two.",4,Kids and Adults Will Both Have a Great Time,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,2068,"['Fievel', 'Mouskawitz', 'family', 'emigrate', 'America', 'native', 'Russia', 'Cossack', 'cats', 'menace', 'Cossacks', 'menace', 'Muscowitz', 'family', 'humans', 'porch', 'live', 'Fievel', 'lost', 'rest', 'family', 'giant', 'storm', 'Neptune', 'gotten', 'angry.Fievel', 'survived', 'storm', 'bottle', 'even', 'apparently', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'got', 'bottle', 'up', 'plinth', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'being', 'built', 'French', 'seagull', 'OK', 'then', 'Siegel', 'get', 'lot', 'Jewish', 'jokes', 'here', 'ever', 'once', 'actually', 'saying', 'are', 'Jewish', 'seagull', 'never', 'say', 'never', 'when', 'discouraged', 'ever', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'family', 'then', 'French', 'floozy', 'pigeons', 'passenger', 'pigeons', 'carry', 'Fievel', 'mainland.Fievel', 'very', 'appealing', 'little', 'guy', 'totally', 'cute', 'way', 'cute', 'voice', 'cute', 'everything', 'may', 'get', 'little', 'tired', 'cute', 'time', 'film', 'Fievel', 'father', 'had', 'told', 'were', 'cats', 'America', 'found', 'early', 'was', 'not', 'true', 'So', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'other', 'several', 'times', 'follow', 'adventures', 'Fievel', 'one', 'hand', 'rest', 'family', 'other', 'become', 'involved', 'plot', 'get', 'rid', 'cats', 'New', 'York.He', 'Tony', 'street-wise', 'Italian-American', 'mouse', 'who', 'Philly', 'go', 'try', 'find', 'family', 'hear', 'Irish', 'colleen', 'mouse', 'speaking', 'out', 'platform', 'actually', 'straw', 'boater', 'hat', 'rouse', 'mice', 'work', 'together', 'get', 'rid', 'cats', 'was', 'first', 'Fievel', 'learned', 'were', 'indeed', 'cats', 'America', 'Meanwhile', 'Tony', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'colleen', 'rather', 'neglects', 'poor', 'Fievel.Once', 'again', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'ruin', 'telling', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'Things', 'get', 'little', 'syrupy', 'here', 'there', 'will', 'love', 'where', 'voices', 'Madeleine', 'Kahn', 'Dom', 'DeLouise', 'show', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'names', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'two']",N/A

Do not make unnecessary edits.3. If it was a theatrical feature, present it in widescreen.Do you think Universal followed those easy steps?Nope.Here is an incomplete list of changes (without spoilers):-New ""humorous"" sound effects were added to scenes where originally there weren't any. It's not funny.-New voices were added to scenes without dialog (or any noise, for that matter).-The alley mice's voices were re-dubbed. Why???-The cover art was changes from a beautiful theatrical poster by Drew Struzan, only to be replaced with... something MUCH less appealing.As I said, this small list of changes is incomplete. There is more.It should be mentioned that there is also no widescreen. Enjoy your fullscreen!

It was screened at the Jewish Film Festival in Atlanta in February 2011 to celebrate its 25 year anniversary.

For the first time the film is presented in it's original 1:85:1 theatrical widescreen aspect ratio. The colors are bright and the picture quality is stunning and very clear. The picture quality is vastly improved over every other past release. There are a few flaws however that may not bother too many people. There is 99.9% no film grain but in a few scenes the picture looks like some of the characters have edge doubling. Almost as if they used a three strip technicolor master and miss-aligned the strips a tiny bit which caused a double effect or ghosting around the edges of some of the characters throughout the movie which however does not distract from the enjoyment of the film. This film definitely does not have the quality that Disney gives their re-mastered classics but all-in-all this is a great film and the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack is superb. This is a great film recommended for children and adults of all ages.

Unlike other animated films that were made in widescreen and were cropped in pan-and-scan fullscreen (where it crops the sides of the screen), this movie (along with other Don Bluth films from ""The Secret of NIMH"" to ""The Pebble and the Penguin"") was made in fullscreen to begin with. So nothing is cropped out, all the top and bottom of the picture is shown (the widescreen version crops out the top and bottom when shown in that presentation). And one problem I have with it is that they added some new voices and sound effects along with re-dubbed versions of alley mice's voices. That sucks.
