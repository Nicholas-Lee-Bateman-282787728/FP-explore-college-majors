They are all such beautiful uplifting stories that it is hard to turn them down.The movies aren't all of the same quality but they are all enjoyable. Christmas shoes is clearly the headliner here. While some are t as good as others you will still enjoy each of these.This is great as a gift. I also feel that while faith is strong in these DVDs there isn't an overwhelming preachiness to them.

However, it's in this collection, along with The Christmas Hope, another tear-jerker.  Unfortunately Christmas is past now, so I'll watch the other movies next Christmas season.  I've seen all or part of most of these movies on the Hallmark Channel - all good 'family' movies.  But I watched A Christmas Visitor on TV every chance I got, until I purchased this collection.  One word of caution when you watch this one:  at the very end of the movie, make sure you have several tissues nearby - it's hard not to keep tears running down your face.  A wonderful and truly inspirational ending to an outstanding storyline - one of Hallmark's best Christmas movies.  Christmas Hope is another 'sad' movie with an uplifting and happy ending.
