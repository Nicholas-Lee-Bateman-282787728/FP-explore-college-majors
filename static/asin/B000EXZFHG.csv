So much more could have been done to actually give some insight into Entwistles playing that was just frittered away with what is basically an interview and some rambling licks that do nothing to really give us any true insight into the thinking behind the playing.Where is the instruction? It isn't here. Sadly, now, we can't rectify this because John is no longer living to make a truly worthwhile instructional video.Pass to the other side of the road on this one.",1,"A Fan of Entwistle, but not this DVD",1201564800,"01 29, 2008",2008,519,"['How', 'disappointed', 'was', 'watch', 'wasted', 'effort', 'So', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'actually', 'give', 'insight', 'Entwistles', 'playing', 'was', 'just', 'frittered', 'away', 'what', 'basically', 'interview', 'rambling', 'licks', 'do', 'nothing', 'really', 'give', 'true', 'insight', 'thinking', 'playing.Where', 'instruction', ""n't"", 'here', 'Sadly', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rectify', 'John', 'no', 'longer', 'living', 'make', 'truly', 'worthwhile', 'instructional', 'video.Pass', 'other', 'side', 'road', 'one']",John Entwistle: Bass Guitar Master Class

Pearl ""J Pearl""","[15, 17]","John Entwistle demonstrates bass solo and rhythmic techniques by himself, and then jams with lead guitarist Arlen Roth, who questions The Ox further on his approach to bass. This gives viewers the chance to focus on Entwistle's bass playing without having to strain to hear it through the deluge (as John described it) of The Who's power chords, drum assaults and slinky synthesizers. Entwistle emerges as an unselfish innovator who was willing to share his skills with others. His deadpan wit quietly perks up the proceedings as well.",5,Expanding bass solo technique,1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,535,"['John', 'Entwistle', 'bass', 'solo', 'rhythmic', 'techniques', 'then', 'jams', 'lead', 'guitarist', 'Arlen', 'Roth', 'who', 'questions', 'Ox', 'further', 'approach', 'bass', 'chance', 'focus', 'Entwistle', 'bass', 'playing', 'having', 'strain', 'hear', 'deluge', 'John', 'described', 'Who', 'power', 'chords', 'drum', 'assaults', 'slinky', 'synthesizers', 'Entwistle', 'unselfish', 'innovator', 'who', 'was', 'willing', 'share', 'skills', 'others', 'deadpan', 'wit', 'quietly', 'up', 'proceedings', 'well']",John Entwistle: Bass Guitar Master Class
980540,A1ER6IYOMM8VCT,B000EXZFHG,"! MR. KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[8, 13]","I have been playing bass for over 30 years and I have always admired John Entwistle's bass playing. Although I never studied his style (or anyone else's for that matter) I have been told I play a lot like him. After watching this DVD, I can see why these people had come to this conclusion as I use a lot of the same techniques John discovered. I learned to play bass by listening to the songs I wanted to learn and I never learned to read music.I picked this DVD up to see if I could learn a trick or two and get some kind of insight on this musical genius's playing style. Well, you're not going to learn much from this DVD, unless you're just starting out and then watching this might discourage you! It's basically John noodling around for a half hour or so not really showing more than finger positions etc. I would also like to point out that his bass tone sounds terrible and distorted to the point that it isn't enjoyable. It would have been nice if we could see both hands when he is playing as it make it even harder to learn anything while watching either hand. It's interesting to watch a couple of times, but not anything you need to own. John Entwistle was one of the greatest bassist of all time, it's a shame we will never get a true insight to his incredible talent.",2,GREAT BASSIST!

The DVD is great because it is an archive of the creative process of a lost musical genius.  Getting past the few practicable tricks, there's some of John's musical philosophies saved for future generations.  I know it sounds silly, but imagine having Hendrix sit down and dissect his playing, or Mozart discuss his thoughts on composition with someone who asks the questions you would.Its also amazing how video production has changes over the past 20 years.  The picture is good, but you can see the improvements in cameras and tapes.",5,"Damn, I Still Can't Play Like Him.",1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,657,"[""'d"", 'like', 'say', 'DVD', 'made', 'difference', 'playing', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'John', 'Entwistle', 'figure', 'out', 'DVD', 'great', 'archive', 'creative', 'process', 'lost', 'musical', 'genius', 'Getting', 'few', 'practicable', 'tricks', 'John', 'musical', 'philosophies', 'saved', 'future', 'generations', 'know', 'silly', 'imagine', 'having', 'Hendrix', 'sit', 'down', 'dissect', 'playing', 'Mozart', 'discuss', 'thoughts', 'composition', 'someone', 'who', 'questions', 'would.Its', 'also', 'amazing', 'how', 'video', 'production', 'changes', 'past', '20', 'years', 'picture', 'good', 'can', 'see', 'improvements', 'cameras', 'tapes']",John Entwistle: Bass Guitar Master Class
