768875,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,B0000AYL47,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[6, 6]","1940's House andManor Houseare my two favorite entries into the House series for very different reasons. Manor House gives us the ugly reality of class differences and human hierarchies; 1940's House shows us that the best humanity has to offer is still with us and we can all aspire to nobility and sacrifice.Much is made of life on the homefront in England during WWII. Indeed, the English suffered for almost two decades to defeat Hitler and it can be argued that they lost their Empire in part to the depradations of the war. The rationing during WWII is legendary in its austerity and one normal, modern English family volunteers to be the middle-class everyman of that era. The fact that they triumph says something about England's finest hour and the English character in general.The family consists of the grandparents, a happily married couple, their single-parent daughter and two grandsons. The husband stays a week at the house, but has to return to work in the 21st century, leaving the two women to cope on their own. This was not unusual during the war years as men were in the service and sometimes doing jobs that took them away on the homefront. The husband has time to put up the Anderson Shelter, not an easy task and impossible without the help of the neighbors, before leaving the women. The women are determined to live by the restrictions imposed on them, saying that if people could do it then, in fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones, they can certainly do it now. They learn that rationing was no joke and that the women of the house often go hungry to make sure the children eat as well as possible. Everything else is restricted too: hot water, clothing, soap and cleaning supplies, cosmetics and hair dye (the grandmother opines that she has never looked like a granny and worries that her husband won't want to share their single beds) and worst of all cigarettes become almost unavailable, which now as then brings all of the stress and anxiety to the surface and helps everybody to unspool. While the hardships get to them their reactions, even their complaints don't have the same ring as those of participants on other House shows. Most of all, their experience in the WWII house brings real change to their lives.The boys learn to play together, to entertain themselves and to depend on each other and on their families. Brothers are forever and these two are glad to learn it. The mother, formerly doubtful about all of her abilites learns that she does have the strength to cope, come what may and the grandmother learns that more can be done with less and takes these changes back to the 21st century cutting her household bills by 60%. And these changes stay with them, these are good people transformed into even better people and it is a joy to watch. Highly, highly recommended to remind us how lucky we are and how much we can live without - but that we cannot live without each other.

However, I must admit I did not find this series to be quite as compelling as ""Frontier House"".For one thing it was impossible to match the emotional intensity that  London families must have been experiencing during the real German bombings. Going out to the bomb shelters was really more of an inconvience for the Hymers. While British families in World War II were actually in fear of their lives.Also this series lacked the drama created by the often turbulent social interactions of the three neighboring families involved in ""Frontier House"". I have to give the Hymers credit for sticking it out to the end. But I found the mother and daughter to be a bit on the whiny and complaining side at times. On the other hand, the two grandsons maintained a fun, positive attitude throughout and it was a pleasure to watch their zest for life and ability to adjust to a way of life without TV and Playstation. Really great kids!I would still consider this recommended viewing.

768877,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B0000AYL47,Elisabeth,"[4, 4]","This PBS project shows what homelife would've been like during WWII.  When the Hymer family first move into their restyled 1940s house, they are given some time to adjust to their new surroundings and then with no mercy, are subjected to escalating rationing laws, black out laws, fines, and air raids.  This family learns quickly the meaning of hard work.While we watch the family cope with these changes, we hear a narrator explain how other families coped with these intrusions on their life and how deadly some of these measures ended up being.  I found these narrations very informative, but would've liked a little more detail on how women felt working alongside men, doing the same work as them but getting paid less and not getting compensated for injuries.Throughout this whole ordeal, the Hymer family doesn't show much emotion.  Maybe some slight irritation, but were mostly expressionless.  On the one hand, I'm glad they weren't whiny and dramatic like the Clune family of The Frontier House, but on the other hand, being so reserved made them hard to read as well, so I didn't get a sense of who they were as people.  They did, however, take the project seriously and followed all the rules, so I appreciated that.Overall, I felt like this project achieved its objectives.  Thanks to the narration and visuals, I walked away from this film with a good sense of how frustrating and uncertain those times must've felt for those wartime families.",5,Living through a war,1312675200,"08 7, 2011",2011,1457,"['PBS', 'project', 'what', 'homelife', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'WWII', 'When', 'Hymer', 'family', 'first', 'move', 'restyled', '1940s', 'house', 'are', 'given', 'time', 'adjust', 'new', 'surroundings', 'then', 'mercy', 'are', 'subjected', 'escalating', 'rationing', 'laws', 'black', 'laws', 'fines', 'air', 'raids', 'family', 'quickly', 'meaning', 'hard', 'watch', 'family', 'cope', 'changes', 'hear', 'narrator', 'explain', 'how', 'other', 'families', 'coped', 'intrusions', 'life', 'how', 'deadly', 'measures', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'found', 'narrations', 'very', 'informative', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'little', 'more', 'detail', 'how', 'women', 'felt', 'working', 'alongside', 'men', 'doing', 'same', 'work', 'getting', 'paid', 'less', 'not', 'getting', 'compensated', 'injuries.Throughout', 'whole', 'ordeal', 'Hymer', 'family', ""n't"", 'show', 'much', 'emotion', 'Maybe', 'slight', 'irritation', 'were', 'mostly', 'expressionless', 'one', 'hand', ""'m"", 'glad', 'were', ""n't"", 'whiny', 'dramatic', 'Clune', 'family', 'Frontier', 'House', 'other', 'hand', 'being', 'so', 'reserved', 'made', 'hard', 'read', 'as', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'who', 'were', 'people', 'did', 'however', 'take', 'project', 'seriously', 'followed', 'rules', 'appreciated', 'that.Overall', 'felt', 'project', 'achieved', 'objectives', 'Thanks', 'narration', 'visuals', 'walked', 'away', 'film', 'good', 'sense', 'how', 'frustrating', 'uncertain', 'times', 'must', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'wartime', 'families']",N/A

It doesn't talk that much about any political issues going on, but more of what was going on in the home & the roles everyone had.  The family in this series was very enjoyable to watch in that they had a good attitude about the adjustments they had to make.  Unlike Frontier House & Colonial House where the families were annoying to listen too.  In the 1940's House, the family is very ethusiastic about the experience.  A couple of weeks into the project they do get frustrated with the lack of technology, but they don't let that get in the way of keeping the spirts up.

Of the two aforesaid British ""Reality Series"", I really adored ""1940's House"" series.  My adoration of ""1940's House"" was mainly due to my admiration of the Hymers family-- a 21st century family consisting of a man, women, grown daughter and her two (2) sons that went ""back in time"" to live as ""everyday"" folks during World War II in England (in a suburb of London).The Hymers, upon viewing this series, became so very enduring to me.  What resilience and humor they exhibited while faced with many adverse conditions (i.e., disruptive and frightening air raids, extreme physical exhaustion from the work load increases, extreme shortages of food, clothing, basic necessities such as toilet paper, gasoline, heating fuel, water, etc).  I especially grew to adore the mother/grandmother/wife, Lyn.  Lyn, in the series, worked so very hard at home taking on the extreme challenges of running a 1940s household without any of the 21st century  useful gadgets that we all take for granted while , at the same time,  doing volunteer work at a Nursing Home.  She successfully managed the aforesaid maintaining wonderful humor especially about her 1940-style ""knickers""--she, in the series ""1940's House"", is a delight.  Likewise and surprising to me, I really enjoyed the grandsons/sons Ben (age 10) and Thomas (age 7)--always taking all ""hardships"" in their stride and able to see the lighter side of all the deplorable things that were happening; it was just a splendid adventure to the boys.  Compared to the folks in ""Manor House"", I found the family in ""1940's House"" very delightful.NO there is no actual bombing shown in this series only simulations of actual bombings though the speakers installed in the home and in the family's ""air-raid shelter"". The family, of course, reacted to these simulations as if they were ""real"".  What were ""real"" were the shortages, rationings and hardships the family was experiencing.  As Lyn stated at the end of the six (6) weeks they spent recreating ""1940's House"", all of the Hymers really grew to understand and appreciate what the actual families of the 1940s in Britain endured during the ""War Years"".",5,Recreation of World War II by a marvelous 21st century British family,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,2262,"['Having', 'viewed', 'immensely', 'enjoyed', 'PBS', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'Manor', 'House', 'eagerly', 'purchased', 'PBS', '1940', 'House', 'two', 'aforesaid', 'British', 'Reality', 'Series', 'really', 'adored', '1940', 'House', 'series', 'adoration', '1940', 'House', 'was', 'mainly', 'due', 'admiration', 'Hymers', 'family', '21st', 'century', 'family', 'consisting', 'man', 'women', 'grown', 'daughter', 'two', '2', 'sons', 'went', 'back', 'time', 'live', 'everyday', 'folks', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'England', 'suburb', 'London', 'Hymers', 'viewing', 'series', 'became', 'so', 'very', 'enduring', 'What', 'resilience', 'humor', 'exhibited', 'faced', 'many', 'adverse', 'conditions', 'i.e.', 'disruptive', 'frightening', 'air', 'raids', 'extreme', 'physical', 'exhaustion', 'work', 'load', 'increases', 'extreme', 'shortages', 'food', 'clothing', 'basic', 'necessities', 'such', 'toilet', 'paper', 'gasoline', 'heating', 'fuel', 'water', 'etc', 'especially', 'grew', 'adore', 'mother/grandmother/wife', 'Lyn', 'Lyn', 'series', 'worked', 'so', 'very', 'hard', 'home', 'taking', 'extreme', 'challenges', 'running', '1940s', 'household', '21st', 'century', 'useful', 'gadgets', 'take', 'granted', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'doing', 'volunteer', 'work', 'Nursing', 'Home', 'successfully', 'managed', 'aforesaid', 'maintaining', 'wonderful', 'humor', 'especially', '1940-style', 'knickers', 'series', '1940', 'House', 'delight', 'Likewise', 'surprising', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'grandsons/sons', 'Ben', 'age', '10', 'Thomas', 'age', '7', 'always', 'taking', 'hardships', 'stride', 'able', 'see', 'lighter', 'side', 'deplorable', 'things', 'were', 'happening', 'was', 'just', 'splendid', 'adventure', 'boys', 'Compared', 'folks', 'Manor', 'House', 'found', 'family', '1940', 'House', 'very', 'delightful.NO', 'actual', 'bombing', 'shown', 'series', 'only', 'simulations', 'actual', 'bombings', 'speakers', 'installed', 'home', 'family', 'air-raid', 'shelter', 'family', 'course', 'reacted', 'simulations', 'were', 'real', 'What', 'were', 'real', 'were', 'shortages', 'rationings', 'family', 'was', 'experiencing', 'Lyn', 'stated', 'end', 'six', '6', 'weeks', 'spent', 'recreating', '1940', 'House', 'Hymers', 'really', 'grew', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'what', 'actual', 'families', '1940s', 'Britain', 'endured', 'War', 'Years']",N/A

What makes 1940's house particularly unique is that the family isn't just experiencing the household appliances or work ethic or social strata of the day, but are placing themselves in the hands of scientists are particulary interested in wartime Brittain. Brittain was one of the most controlled countries in the world during wartime, but it helped them survive. In this series, the family is subjected to wartime rations, Brittish law (blackout demands and so forth), Bomb raids, and are plunged into the type of hectic schedule the average citizen was expected to keep in order to make sure everyone did their part. The family is made up of a young mother and her two young boys and her parents. Midway, as in many households of the day, the father is sent away for wartime employment and the women are left alone to survive.My husband and I have been watching the house shows (Manor House, Frontier House, etc.) in historical chronological order. This is obviously the last that we watched, and though this is an extremely hard thing for me to say since they're all so interesting, it is the best. I'm sure some will disagree. However, the major difference we have seen that has endeared this particular series to our hearts is the startling difference in attitude of the family involved.Sure, the family becomes cranky and upset from time to time (mostly because of hunger and a shortage of cigarettes) but their mindset from the beginning is clear - we here to reenact war. As the grandmother so positively put it, ""we don't have to worry about our lives, we haven't had any deaths, so the least we can do is subject ourselves to the other hardships that were experienced"". From the beginning the family displays the greatest respect for the project and for the people that truly experienced this period in history. Other House series do give the impression that some of the participants were more interested in stardom than history. Not so with this family. Their sense of duty to the project lends the entire program an appeal missing from other PBS projects.Perhaps one key factor to this resilient attitude is the fact that they are constantly put in contact with those who really experienced what they are reenacting. On top of this, original BBC broadcasts are played on the home radio, with real footage of people who had survived bomb raids. Throughout the program, you see the family literally beginning to change much the way that people who truly lived in that era would have. The oldest boy, who is not even out of elementary school, becomes a small man. The women become stronger and more independent. All say they have learned to look out rather than always in and see those in need around them.This is perhaps one of the greatest war memorials we have ever seen - better than any plaque, or cold stone structure. Here, those involved in the project have done the best they can to place themselves in the shoes of the greatest generation - for the sake of ""just doing it"". My husband and I frequently found ourselves moved to tears.This series would be marvelous for any family to watch together - and would be a fabulous tool in schools. We need to understand what our elders suffered to bring us the freedom and wealth we have today. It is a shame that our society has become so reliant on materialistic stimulation. On top of that, we have brought narcissism to new heights - all while complaining we don't hav enough. We have so much, but are often too lazy to appreciate it. If you watch only one of the ""House"" projects, 1940's House is by far the best.

I have seen 2 of the other House programs...Manor House and Colonial House; but 1940's House is so much better than either of the others.This 'real life family' showed me so much of what it was 'really like' to be a part of that time and place of England, during that horrible war. The family chosen for this task was truly doing everything they could to be faithful to their assignment. With the exception of the little boys who chose to share their schoolmate's non-wartime lunches, this family was doing all they could to follow the rules of this incredible task. Of course, the boys were young and feeling the hunger of the 'wartime rationing'.I am so grateful that PBS continues to provide us with programs of such great quality and education value. I feel so blessed to have this wonderful and inspiring program as a part of my video collection.

768884,A35L81CBN2Z8C0,B0000AYL47,J. R. Neumiller,"[10, 11]","I just finished watching this for the first time, and I really enjoyed it very much. My only previous exposure to a ""House"" documentary was the 1900's house, where a modern day family moves into a Victorian style ""time machine"" house and must carry on life in that milieu.The difference between that show and this one are striking - mostly, because 1940's House had a decided purpose, which was to get through the British World War II. 1900's House had no other purpose than to simply experience the life and do the best they could. It didn't come across so well because of the enormous time and cultural differences. I felt that if that family had had a chance to warm up to the period, they may have done better. Also, I believe 1900 House was the first of its type, so the later shows have benefited from the lessons learned.The Hymers were the perfect family to undergo this treatment. The Grandpa had always dreamed of living in this time period, and his wife, daughter, and two grandsons had excellent temperaments to go along with this. (Unlike 1900 House, where the oldest daughter basically quit about half way through with a thoroughly modern, although just as typical for the period, middle-class attitude about the whole thing.)With 1940 House, you really feel like you're experiencing the war experience. This family's difficulties and trials perfectly underscore the unusual and trying events the actual participants of the time surely underwent. That's what makes this documentary work so well. Their efforts to overcome the difficulties of living under a war-time regimen portrayed so poignantly the realities of those who lived through those times.All five members of this family could so easily have come from that time period. In fact, what struck me so powerfully was that, for all practical purposes, they SHOULD be living in that period. In fact, we all should: for all our modern conveniences, we are so vastly lacking in real substance and meaning in our lives. Its more than a shame or travesty, it's a great evil. A very hateful evil.We can never go back. And which of us will ever face such circumstances as the Hymers, to let us see how much we waste? How little of our lives we truly live. How much real substance we routinely forfeit for the sake of the cheap and the immediate. (These computers be damned, yet.)Though the Hymers never experienced any real threat of death or danger, they gave us a very real taste of the vitality and meaning of the times they recreated. I heard it said once that during the war, mental hospitals saw over 1/3 of all their patients voluntarily leave, due to the power of what was happening around them. People simply could not dwell upon themselves with all the momentous events taking place. Even this documentary references this statistic: during the war years, female suicides decreased by 50%. There was simply too much to do than feel sorry for one's self.A part of me wants to make contact with the Hymers, to let them know how powerfully their experience affected me. I would like to encourage them to continue in the vein they established, and not let modern life ruin their lives.",5,The Best of its Kind,1170374400,"02 2, 2007",2007,3153,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'only', 'previous', 'exposure', 'House', 'documentary', 'was', '1900', 'house', 'where', 'modern', 'day', 'family', 'Victorian', 'style', 'time', 'machine', 'house', 'must', 'carry', 'life', 'milieu.The', 'difference', 'show', 'one', 'are', 'striking', 'mostly', '1940', 'House', 'had', 'decided', 'purpose', 'was', 'get', 'British', 'World', 'War', 'II', '1900', 'House', 'had', 'other', 'purpose', 'simply', 'experience', 'life', 'do', 'best', 'could', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'so', 'well', 'enormous', 'time', 'cultural', 'differences', 'felt', 'family', 'had', 'had', 'chance', 'warm', 'up', 'period', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'Also', 'believe', '1900', 'House', 'was', 'first', 'type', 'later', 'shows', 'have', 'benefited', 'lessons', 'learned.The', 'Hymers', 'were', 'perfect', 'family', 'undergo', 'treatment', 'Grandpa', 'had', 'always', 'dreamed', 'living', 'time', 'period', 'wife', 'daughter', 'two', 'grandsons', 'had', 'excellent', 'temperaments', 'go', 'along', '1900', 'House', 'where', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'basically', 'quit', 'half', 'way', 'thoroughly', 'modern', 'just', 'typical', 'period', 'middle-class', 'attitude', 'whole', 'thing', '1940', 'House', 'really', 'feel', ""'re"", 'experiencing', 'war', 'experience', 'family', 'difficulties', 'trials', 'perfectly', 'unusual', 'trying', 'events', 'actual', 'participants', 'time', 'surely', 'underwent', 'what', 'documentary', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'efforts', 'overcome', 'difficulties', 'living', 'war-time', 'regimen', 'portrayed', 'so', 'poignantly', 'realities', 'who', 'lived', 'times.All', 'five', 'members', 'family', 'could', 'so', 'easily', 'have', 'come', 'time', 'period', 'fact', 'what', 'struck', 'powerfully', 'was', 'practical', 'purposes', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'living', 'period', 'fact', 'should', 'modern', 'conveniences', 'are', 'so', 'vastly', 'lacking', 'real', 'substance', 'meaning', 'lives', 'more', 'shame', 'travesty', 'great', 'evil', 'very', 'hateful', 'evil.We', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'back', 'will', 'ever', 'face', 'such', 'circumstances', 'Hymers', 'let', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'waste', 'How', 'little', 'lives', 'truly', 'live', 'How', 'much', 'real', 'substance', 'routinely', 'forfeit', 'sake', 'cheap', 'immediate', 'computers', 'be', 'damned', 'yet', 'Hymers', 'never', 'experienced', 'real', 'threat', 'death', 'danger', 'gave', 'very', 'real', 'taste', 'vitality', 'meaning', 'times', 'recreated', 'heard', 'said', 'once', 'war', 'mental', 'hospitals', 'saw', '1/3', 'patients', 'voluntarily', 'leave', 'due', 'power', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'People', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'dwell', 'momentous', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'Even', 'documentary', 'references', 'statistic', 'war', 'years', 'female', 'suicides', 'decreased', '50', '%', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'do', 'feel', 'sorry', 'one', 'self.A', 'part', 'make', 'contact', 'Hymers', 'let', 'know', 'how', 'powerfully', 'experience', 'affected', 'would', 'like', 'encourage', 'continue', 'vein', 'established', 'not', 'let', 'modern', 'life', 'ruin', 'lives']",N/A

But, I didn't realize how meaningful it was to be for me. So, immediately after watching it and throwing away my kleenex, I shipped one off to my History-loving Dad. At first, I was concerned that the mom's attitude was going to ruin the purpose of the timetravel to War-Torn 1940's England, but she ended up having the visiting of women who lived through the bombs, the death, the dispair, and the rationing turn her way of thinking almost fully around. It was an awesome and just about perfect choice of the family,too. The couple's grown daughter had just been abandoned by her real-life husband (totally HIS loss - she is an amazing woman)and has two impressionable school-aged boys. As a teacher, I feel no shame in expressing the respect and admiration I have for the way British youngsters behave.

Aside from some exhaustive attention to detail from the BBC which made it, right down to having a shop and shopkeeper all kitted out for the time period, what makes this far superior to all other reality TV re-enactments is the casting.This family is underpinned by a wonderfully witty, acerbic, amusing, constantly bemused, vodka drinking, cigarette smoking modern-day gran. A woman who comes out with such fantastic hilarious one-liners, and such sorrow only moments later as she identifies with the era that she is re-creating, that she should be on the stage.Her grandson, too, is wonderful with an eloquence belying his age as he describes with utter delight and exquisitely precise detail the food his mother now prepares.The best part of the series is the last episode, as we find out what they missed most and how they've changed. And how, according to her grandson, ""Gran went quite barking mad"". Indeed, Gran now wants to now live in the 40s, much to her family's incredulousness.My only small beef is a grating voiced PBS public service announcement cutting across the lovely music during the opening credits thanking everyone for their support. A better way to thank us would be to not ruin an otherwise beautiful piece of work which was already attempting to put us gracefully into the 1940s, only to have us rudely jolted back out. Idiots.

The 1940s House is wonderful with the three generations of the family really committed to living as people did in England during WWII.  I have a much better understanding of the deprivation experienced and high cost to England of the War years and a new appreciation of one of our closest allies.  I highly recommend this DVD to people who enjoy British productions which were shown in the U.S. on PBS.,5,Fantastic view of English life during WWII,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,508,"['am', 'fascinated', 'documentaries', 'have', 'modern', 'families', 'living', 'way', 'people', 'did', 'years', 'past', '1940s', 'House', 'wonderful', 'three', 'generations', 'family', 'really', 'committed', 'living', 'people', 'did', 'England', 'WWII', 'have', 'much', 'better', 'understanding', 'deprivation', 'experienced', 'high', 'cost', 'England', 'War', 'years', 'new', 'appreciation', 'one', 'closest', 'allies', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'British', 'productions', 'were', 'shown', 'U.S.', 'PBS']",N/A
