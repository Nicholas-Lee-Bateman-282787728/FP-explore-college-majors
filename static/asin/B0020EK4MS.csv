1245950,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0020EK4MS,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Table for Three is a film that starts out like a typically unfunny chick flick where every single joke seems to miss the mark, however once the storyline kicks in (about a crazy boyfriend and girlfriend who give their roommate frequent headaches with their many crazy antics) this is when Table for Three improves considerably.Not all the jokes work though.  That's the number one thing you must keep in mind.  I'd say only about 50% of the jokes work for me personally.  This is actually because the guy playing the main character (the guy looking for a roommate) to be somewhat of a weak comedian.  He's not very funny at all- it's how he reacts to the crazy events around him that makes the storyline work.I'm really surprised that the quality of the storytelling very slowly molds into something much better and funnier with time and patience.Alright, so my rating is a weak 4 star overall rating, but still- I was definitely finding myself enjoying Table for Three the more the story moved along, so I consider this movie a *tad* underrated.Pick it up for a minor classic in the comedy genre.",4,"average at first, but improves",1283299200,"09 1, 2010",2010,1097,"['Table', 'Three', 'film', 'out', 'typically', 'unfunny', 'chick', 'flick', 'where', 'single', 'joke', 'miss', 'mark', 'however', 'once', 'storyline', 'kicks', 'crazy', 'boyfriend', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'give', 'roommate', 'frequent', 'headaches', 'many', 'crazy', 'antics', 'when', 'Table', 'Three', 'considerably.Not', 'jokes', 'work', 'though', 'number', 'one', 'thing', 'must', 'keep', 'mind', ""'d"", 'say', 'only', 'about', '50', '%', 'jokes', 'work', 'personally', 'actually', 'guy', 'playing', 'main', 'character', 'guy', 'looking', 'roommate', 'be', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'comedian', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'all-', 'how', 'crazy', 'events', 'storyline', 'work.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'surprised', 'quality', 'storytelling', 'very', 'slowly', 'molds', 'something', 'much', 'better', 'funnier', 'time', 'patience.Alright', 'rating', 'weak', '4', 'star', 'overall', 'rating', 'still-', 'was', 'definitely', 'finding', 'enjoying', 'Table', 'Three', 'more', 'story', 'moved', 'along', 'consider', 'movie', '*tad*', 'underrated.Pick', 'up', 'minor', 'classic', 'comedy', 'genre']",Table For Three
1245951,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0020EK4MS,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","Superman, Brooke Davis (One Tree Hill), Leonard Hofstadter (The Big Bang Theory), Dr. Allison Cameron (House); none of them could save this movie from itself. The man of steel, a vapid California babe, a physicist, and a medical doctor...nothing doing.Table for Three, is supposed to be a sweet romantic movie about a poor guy that acts a lot like Ted Mosby (How I Met Your Mother), he falls in love quickly and wants to get married quickly. He works from home and needs a new room mate. After interviewing a bunch of losers, he finds Mary and Ryan. They seem attentive and nice. The 'hilarity' begins when the pair, a couple since high school, move in. They want to do everything with Scott, especially protect him from falling in love too quickly. It all starts off innocent and happy, but quickly spins out of control with Scott hating the couple.The strange part about this movie, the last 15 minutes are actually kind of a surprise and are half way decent. Some twists happen that almost save the film. Unfortunately, like a comedian telling a joke and then talking after the punch line, the film kept going for another 5 minutes after it should have ended. There is no reason why I had to know that about the happy couple.The cast is uneven. Brandon Routh (Superman Returns) as Scott, sadly delivers his lines dead pan and with very little emotion, it is hard to fell much from his character. Jesse Bradford (West Wing, the creepy Ryan Pierce), is just so irritating. Sophia Bush (One Tree Hill) was sometimes incredibly sexy, horribly cloying, and dumb; not exactly the best combination. Johnny Galecki (Big Bang Theory and Rosanne) was one of the few genuine, believeable interesting characters as a past victim of the Ryan and Mary disease. Jennifer Morrison (House) was absolutely stunning, beautiful, smart, quirky, interesting; and not on the screen nearly enough. The few high spots, Galecki, Morrison and occasionally Bush, were just not enough to salvage the whole film.Technically this is a simple, fairly low budget film. In general light was good. Sound well recorded. Shots were in focus. But there was nothing creative or compelling about framing, camera work, or editing. If it weren't for the language and nudity, this could have passed for a television program.The film is rated R. There is a lot of strong language, and sexual innuendo. There is a scene in a strip club with topless women. At one point Sophia Bush says, 'and I even wore panties' pulling up her dress to show her panties. This is the type of humor in the film. There is no violence or gore. Younger viewers, probably depends a lot on tolerance for language, situations, and nudity.The film is at least 20 minutes too long at one hour and thirty three minutes. The jokes climaxed early and then the comedian kept talking. The pay off was way too late in the film, and then it was diluted with a needless final poke at the happy couple. Most will stop watching after a half hour, Scott is just that boring, and Ryan that irritating.The DVD includes one of those awful making of featurettes where the actors and directors simply retell the whole story. They have nothing to add to an already overdrawn story. Do not watch this featurette before the film, the entire movie is told in roughly 25 minutes.Overall this is not a very good movie. Sophia Bush and Jennifer Morrison are pretty and worth watching. The ending is good. But there is just too much irritation along the way.",3,"Not A Good Movie, Not An Awful Movie",1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,3466,"['Superman', 'Brooke', 'Davis', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'Leonard', 'Hofstadter', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'Dr.', 'Allison', 'Cameron', 'House', 'none', 'could', 'save', 'movie', 'man', 'steel', 'vapid', 'California', 'babe', 'physicist', 'medical', 'doctor', 'nothing', 'doing.Table', 'Three', 'supposed', 'be', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'movie', 'poor', 'guy', 'lot', 'Ted', 'Mosby', 'How', 'Met', 'Your', 'Mother', 'love', 'quickly', 'get', 'married', 'quickly', 'home', 'new', 'room', 'mate', 'interviewing', 'bunch', 'losers', 'Mary', 'Ryan', 'seem', 'attentive', 'nice', ""'hilarity"", 'begins', 'when', 'pair', 'couple', 'high', 'school', 'move', 'want', 'do', 'everything', 'Scott', 'especially', 'protect', 'falling', 'love', 'too', 'quickly', 'innocent', 'happy', 'quickly', 'control', 'Scott', 'hating', 'couple.The', 'strange', 'part', 'movie', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'are', 'actually', 'kind', 'surprise', 'are', 'half', 'way', 'decent', 'twists', 'happen', 'almost', 'save', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'comedian', 'telling', 'joke', 'then', 'talking', 'punch', 'line', 'film', 'kept', 'going', '5', 'minutes', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'reason', 'why', 'had', 'know', 'happy', 'couple.The', 'cast', 'uneven', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'Scott', 'sadly', 'lines', 'dead', 'pan', 'very', 'little', 'emotion', 'hard', 'fell', 'much', 'character', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'West', 'Wing', 'creepy', 'Ryan', 'Pierce', 'just', 'so', 'irritating', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'was', 'sometimes', 'incredibly', 'sexy', 'horribly', 'cloying', 'dumb', 'not', 'exactly', 'best', 'combination', 'Johnny', 'Galecki', 'Big', 'Bang', 'Theory', 'Rosanne', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'genuine', 'believeable', 'interesting', 'characters', 'past', 'victim', 'Ryan', 'Mary', 'disease', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'House', 'was', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'beautiful', 'smart', 'quirky', 'interesting', 'not', 'screen', 'nearly', 'enough', 'few', 'high', 'spots', 'Galecki', 'Morrison', 'occasionally', 'Bush', 'were', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'salvage', 'whole', 'film.Technically', 'simple', 'fairly', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'general', 'light', 'was', 'good', 'Sound', 'well', 'recorded', 'Shots', 'were', 'focus', 'was', 'nothing', 'creative', 'compelling', 'framing', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'were', ""n't"", 'language', 'nudity', 'could', 'have', 'passed', 'television', 'program.The', 'film', 'rated', 'R.', 'lot', 'strong', 'language', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'scene', 'strip', 'club', 'topless', 'women', 'one', 'point', 'Sophia', 'Bush', ""'and"", 'even', 'wore', 'panties', 'pulling', 'up', 'dress', 'show', 'panties', 'type', 'humor', 'film', 'violence', 'gore', 'Younger', 'viewers', 'probably', 'lot', 'tolerance', 'language', 'situations', 'nudity.The', 'film', 'least', '20', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'one', 'hour', 'thirty', 'three', 'minutes', 'jokes', 'climaxed', 'early', 'then', 'comedian', 'kept', 'talking', 'pay', 'off', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'late', 'film', 'then', 'was', 'diluted', 'needless', 'final', 'poke', 'happy', 'couple', 'Most', 'will', 'stop', 'watching', 'half', 'hour', 'Scott', 'just', 'boring', 'Ryan', 'irritating.The', 'DVD', 'one', 'awful', 'making', 'featurettes', 'where', 'actors', 'directors', 'simply', 'retell', 'whole', 'story', 'have', 'nothing', 'add', 'already', 'overdrawn', 'story', 'Do', 'not', 'watch', 'featurette', 'film', 'entire', 'movie', 'told', 'roughly', '25', 'minutes.Overall', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'are', 'pretty', 'worth', 'watching', 'ending', 'good', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'irritation', 'way']",Table For Three

Quickly their effervescent lifestyle begins to wear on Scott's prefered state of meloncholy, and he cannot discern if they are simply this happy or whether they are manipulating his life (or both).Scott's slowly rising suspicions aren't helped by Mary and Ryan's acquaintence Ted (Johnny Galecki) whose experiences with Mary and Ryan make him a walking warning against befriending them.At times the film gets increasingly strange, hilariously surreal and highly entertaining.[...]",5,Why did this not get general theatrical release...?,1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,1071,"['actor', 'who', 'background', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'worked', 'Table', 'Three', 'url', 'report', 'when', 'film', 'hit', 'DVD', 'rented', 'Netflix', 'found', 'amusing', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'outright.It', 'quirkily', 'amusing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'funny', 'theatre', 'direct-to-DVD', 'film.Brandon', 'Routh', 'Scott', 'somewhat', 'hapless', 'fellow', 'life', 'circumstances', 'have', 'resort', 'seeking', 'roommate', 'ending', 'up', 'renting', 'couple', 'Mary', 'Ryan', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'seem', 'sickly', 'sweet', 'two', 'are', 'attached', 'hip', 'Quickly', 'effervescent', 'lifestyle', 'wear', 'Scott', 'prefered', 'state', 'meloncholy', 'can', 'not', 'discern', 'are', 'simply', 'happy', 'are', 'manipulating', 'life', '.Scott', 'slowly', 'rising', 'suspicions', 'are', ""n't"", 'helped', 'Mary', 'Ryan', 'acquaintence', 'Ted', 'Johnny', 'Galecki', 'experiences', 'Mary', 'Ryan', 'make', 'walking', 'warning', 'befriending', 'them.At', 'times', 'film', 'increasingly', 'strange', 'hilariously', 'surreal', 'highly', 'entertaining.', '[', ']']",Table For Three

The story has great plot, moving in good pace stimulating viewer's emotion up and down just to keep it interesting.  I have no choice but to get the Dvd, the only format ( beside Prime ) release.

1245954,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B0020EK4MS,Kevin Killian,"[2, 2]","I liked Brandon Routh in the Superman reboot and I feel he got the shaft after that, the studio treated him terribly so I was rooting for the underdog all the way through this one.  Routh is actually very good as Scott, once you got over the premise that he is supposed to be utterly without friends; surely he is too handsome and personable for that, and yet his dealings with Warners did give him this sad air of one left out in the cold, so who knows, it COULD happen.  Others have commented that he isn't that funny, but he doesn't have to be, Jesse Bradford and Sophia Bush are almost too funny, you get tired watching them steal scenes from each other, and it's a relief when they leave the screen for a moment.The writing has its ups and downs, that's for sure.  If the writing had been better I would have given 5 stars to this film, for it had an original premise, one I don't remember seeing before in any film: how a couple can become a ""couple monster,"" a sort of borg like creature that devours the single and spits them out still halfalive.  My wife and I were looking at ourselves in a terrible paroxysm of guilt thinking of how often we had acted like Ryan and Mary, perhaps not so one-dimensionally, but still.  Maybe the film does have a sort of ancestor in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? which uses some of the same material but gives it a twist with the enigma of the son who may not really be a real person.  I had never seen Sophia Bush before, but here she is splendid and she really seems to be so into the character that she fizzes like a firework, and as for Jennifer Morrison, she is pretty adorable (she is also an actress new to me) and at first I thought she must be the daughter of Jan on The Office, for she shares so many of the veteran actress' mannerisms and facial expressions, while even her vocal register is similar.Yes, it is terribly vulgar, and yes, it is the sort of movie that leaves red herrings gangling all the way through it, but I liked it a lot!  (One thing I thought of was, if Scott could hear Ryan and Mary so clearly every time they had sex, why didn't he mention it to them?  And also, we see him early in the movie with a roommate who has been transferred to another country: didn't he ever hear his roommate getting it on, or is it that maybe he liked it when it was the one guy, but just couldn't deal with this combo?)  (But if they straightened that out, whole layers of plot would have had to go, so, that's comedy for you, it's murder!)",4,Hasta Lasagna,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",2010,2499,"['liked', 'Brandon', 'Routh', 'Superman', 'reboot', 'feel', 'got', 'shaft', 'studio', 'treated', 'terribly', 'was', 'rooting', 'underdog', 'way', 'one', 'Routh', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'Scott', 'once', 'got', 'premise', 'supposed', 'be', 'utterly', 'friends', 'surely', 'too', 'handsome', 'personable', 'yet', 'dealings', 'Warners', 'did', 'give', 'sad', 'air', 'one', 'left', 'out', 'cold', 'who', 'COULD', 'happen', 'Others', 'have', 'commented', ""n't"", 'funny', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Jesse', 'Bradford', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'are', 'almost', 'too', 'funny', 'get', 'tired', 'watching', 'steal', 'scenes', 'other', 'relief', 'when', 'leave', 'screen', 'moment.The', 'writing', 'ups', 'downs', 'sure', 'writing', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'film', 'had', 'original', 'premise', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'film', 'how', 'couple', 'can', 'become', 'couple', 'monster', 'sort', 'borg', 'creature', 'single', 'out', 'still', 'halfalive', 'wife', 'were', 'looking', 'terrible', 'paroxysm', 'guilt', 'thinking', 'how', 'often', 'had', 'acted', 'Ryan', 'Mary', 'perhaps', 'not', 'so', 'one-dimensionally', 'still', 'Maybe', 'film', 'have', 'sort', 'ancestor', 'WHO', 'AFRAID', 'OF', 'VIRGINIA', 'WOOLF', 'same', 'material', 'twist', 'enigma', 'son', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'real', 'person', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'here', 'splendid', 'really', 'be', 'so', 'character', 'firework', 'Jennifer', 'Morrison', 'pretty', 'adorable', 'also', 'actress', 'new', 'first', 'thought', 'must', 'be', 'daughter', 'Jan', 'Office', 'shares', 'so', 'many', 'veteran', 'actress', 'mannerisms', 'facial', 'expressions', 'even', 'vocal', 'register', 'similar.Yes', 'terribly', 'vulgar', 'yes', 'sort', 'movie', 'red', 'herrings', 'gangling', 'way', 'liked', 'lot', 'One', 'thing', 'thought', 'was', 'Scott', 'could', 'hear', 'Ryan', 'Mary', 'so', 'clearly', 'time', 'had', 'sex', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'also', 'see', 'early', 'movie', 'roommate', 'who', 'been', 'transferred', 'country', 'did', ""n't"", 'ever', 'hear', 'roommate', 'getting', 'maybe', 'liked', 'when', 'was', 'one', 'guy', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'deal', 'combo', 'straightened', 'out', 'whole', 'layers', 'plot', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'go', 'so', 'comedy', 'murder']",Table For Three

Routh, absent from the limelight after essaying the Man of Steel three years ago, is very good as a romantic leading man, but the film is derailed by the excessive maneuvering of the couple from hell, when the movie switches from pleasant dramedy to a broad screwball romp that favors sight gags and slapstick over characterization.
