We can all laugh at ourselves.  He was Richard Pryor's right hand man and I can see why good comedy is still possible.  He doesn't mince words and makes everybody laugh in his own unique way.  If you cannot laugh at yourself through his sense of humor than you cannot understand being in America!!!,5,Great Comedy,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,427,"['Even', 'Mr.', 'Mooney', 'comedy', 'cuff', 'still', 'best', 'comedian', 'racism', 'ridiculous', 'everybody', 'can', 'laugh', 'ourselves', 'was', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'good', 'comedy', 'still', 'possible', ""n't"", 'mince', 'words', 'everybody', 'laugh', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'can', 'not', 'laugh', 'sense', 'humor', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'being', 'America']",N/A
