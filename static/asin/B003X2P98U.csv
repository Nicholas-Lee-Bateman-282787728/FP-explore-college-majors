The premise is simple: A stay-at-home mom discovers that her husband is a low-life and has been cheating on her with a much younger woman.  He divorces her and shafts her in the divorce settlement.  After a series of unfortunate events, she becomes homeless.  She makes some new friends and with their help she is able to pull herself up by her bootstraps, so to speak, and begins a new life.  Some elements of the story may be somewhat far fetched, but it is just that, a story.  When my wife and I watch the film, it makes us feel good.  I mean, come on, who doesn't love a happy ending?  Linda Hamilton is an excellent actress and gives a yeoman's effort in this movie.  I gave the film five stars because it is the kind of movie I can watch every year and not get tired of.

They also seemed to celebrate accomplished liars, denial, and a convenient plot point in the guise of the knight in shining armor.  If they had unflinchingly dealt with the plight of the homeless that would have been something in their favor, but they didn't go that route.

Too many criticisms seem to fall into the category of Julie being dense and incapable of recovering on her own. This movie reminds me of how many women in real circumstances get dumped or abused.Can you imagine the shock of being suddenly abandoned, by a spouse who arranged everything in advance to cripple you from fighting back? Shock and disbelief slows anyone. I thought it was obvious that this was what he planned. This movie is an example of what happens to many women, who suddenly find themselves without a spouse, without an income, without true friends or close family. Facing all this while trying to hang on to some scrap of dignity is hard. For some women it's unthinkable to receive charity when they were the ones who proudly gave to charity.Can you imagine trying to sneak a quick wash up in a Wal-Mart restroom, lingering in a public building just to keep warm? Or, going from grocery to grocery to eat sample food? There are women who absolutely would refuse welfare, or help from judgemental family in desperate hope to rise above their situation.While surviving, Julie does meet a man, and yes, he looks to be a decent person for her in the future, but in her abrupt change of circumstances, and with her own grit and determination, she survives.Toward the end of the movie, I saw her future as looking more secure, using her untapped talents and gaining employment.
