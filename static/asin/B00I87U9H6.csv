Secondly, the fine ensemble cast, heartwarming stories, andgreat production values all come together to make this one of the best dramas on television.  With some comedic subplots thrown in here and there, to keep it from being too heavy, it is just the right blend of easy watching.  Very enjoyable fare.",5,Very Entertaining!,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,371,"['First', 'off', 'anything', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'know', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Secondly', 'fine', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'heartwarming', 'stories', 'andgreat', 'production', 'come', 'together', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'dramas', 'television', 'comedic', 'subplots', 'thrown', 'here', 'there', 'keep', 'being', 'too', 'heavy', 'just', 'right', 'blend', 'easy', 'watching', 'Very', 'enjoyable', 'fare']",In The Heat of the Night Season 7

Mr. O'Connor looks like he has indigestion, or that he really doesn't want anyone to buy this package.  I doubt he would be happy with the photo chosen.  More problems noted later...I am a big Carroll O'Connor fan and have been enjoying this, his second successful TV series, on DVD.  Season 7 brings about some big changes:  the Virgil Tibbs (Howard Rollins) character makes only a few appearances, and Althea and Willson Sweet are gone completely (the latter's absence is completely unexplained).  Also, due to corrupt city council manipulation, Bill Gillespie is out as police chief and Hampton Forbes (Carl Weathers) is in.  Gilliespie remains in the mix as the replacement for Newman County Sheriff McCloud, who had a heart attack.  He gets involved with Sparta Police cases much more than McCloud ever did.Carrying over are old friends Bubba, Parker, and Lonnie Jamison, with bigger parts for lovely Crystal Fox and handsome Mark Johnson (Luann and Everett).  Dee and Peake are back too.  And of course the excellent Denise Nicholas returns as councilmember and O'Connor's love interest, Harriet DeLong.Now we get to the problems.  The worst is that not all episodes are here.  Most of the episodes are self-contained so this is not disastrous as it would be for other shows.  But the series built up the slow burning, challenged-by-many romance between the Chief and Ms. DeLong only to OMIT THEIR WEDDING EPISODE!!!  In the last, 2-part episode featuring a psycho cult leader played by Peter Fonda, Bill and Harriet are suddenly leaving on their honeymoon!  I feel like I wasn't invited!There are also huge disparities in picture quality, from scene to scene and shots between scenes, and as usual no special features.  Even though O'Connors Carroll and Hugh are gone, as is Mr. Rollins, even a brief mini-feature with surviving cast members would have been appreciated.  Especially since--despite half the town killing the other half with regularity--this show had a warm, relaxed feel to it.  I would have liked to have heard from Alan Autry, David Ward, and Ms. Nicholas among others.If I could I'd give this three and a half stars, five for the show and two for the subpar presentation.",4,Fine TV Show Poorly Presented on DVD,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,2293,"['Let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'first', 'Was', 'there', 'NO', 'OTHER', 'PHOTO', 'available', 'put', 'cover', 'Mr.', ""O'Connor"", 'indigestion', 'really', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'buy', 'package', 'doubt', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'photo', 'chosen', 'More', 'problems', 'noted', 'later', 'am', 'big', 'Carroll', ""O'Connor"", 'fan', 'have', 'been', 'enjoying', 'second', 'successful', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'Season', '7', 'brings', 'big', 'changes', 'Virgil', 'Tibbs', 'Howard', 'Rollins', 'character', 'only', 'few', 'appearances', 'Althea', 'Willson', 'Sweet', 'are', 'gone', 'completely', 'latter', 'absence', 'completely', 'unexplained', 'Also', 'due', 'corrupt', 'city', 'council', 'manipulation', 'Bill', 'Gillespie', 'out', 'police', 'chief', 'Hampton', 'Forbes', 'Carl', 'Weathers', 'Gilliespie', 'mix', 'replacement', 'Newman', 'County', 'Sheriff', 'McCloud', 'who', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'involved', 'Sparta', 'Police', 'cases', 'much', 'more', 'McCloud', 'ever', 'did.Carrying', 'over', 'are', 'old', 'friends', 'Bubba', 'Parker', 'Lonnie', 'Jamison', 'bigger', 'parts', 'lovely', 'Crystal', 'Fox', 'handsome', 'Mark', 'Johnson', 'Luann', 'Everett', 'Dee', 'Peake', 'are', 'back', 'too', 'course', 'excellent', 'Denise', 'Nicholas', 'councilmember', ""O'Connor"", 'love', 'interest', 'Harriet', 'DeLong.Now', 'get', 'problems', 'worst', 'not', 'episodes', 'are', 'here', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', 'self-contained', 'not', 'disastrous', 'would', 'be', 'other', 'shows', 'series', 'built', 'slow', 'burning', 'challenged-by-many', 'romance', 'Chief', 'Ms.', 'DeLong', 'only', 'OMIT', 'THEIR', 'WEDDING', 'EPISODE', 'last', '2-part', 'episode', 'featuring', 'psycho', 'cult', 'leader', 'played', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'Bill', 'Harriet', 'are', 'suddenly', 'leaving', 'honeymoon', 'feel', 'was', ""n't"", 'invited', 'are', 'also', 'huge', 'disparities', 'picture', 'quality', 'scene', 'scene', 'shots', 'scenes', 'usual', 'special', 'features', 'Even', ""O'Connors"", 'Carroll', 'Hugh', 'are', 'gone', 'Mr.', 'Rollins', 'even', 'brief', 'mini-feature', 'surviving', 'cast', 'members', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'appreciated', 'Especially', 'town', 'killing', 'other', 'half', 'regularity', 'show', 'had', 'warm', 'relaxed', 'feel', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'heard', 'Alan', 'Autry', 'David', 'Ward', 'Ms.', 'Nicholas', 'others.If', 'could', ""'d"", 'give', 'three', 'half', 'stars', 'five', 'show', 'two', 'subpar', 'presentation']",In The Heat of the Night Season 7
