936506,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B000B64TZK,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[1, 1]","'Strip Nude for your Killer' (Nude per l'assassino) begins with an disturbing scene involving a failed abortion - this graphic scene is the opening shot, and if the film had continued in this same vein, I don't think I could have stomached it.  It isn't so much that director Andrea Bianchi lets up throughout the rest of the film, but most of what comes later is at least somewhat conventional for this type of film - lots of disrobing and dismembering.  It is called 'Strip Nude for your Killer' after all, and with pretty good reason.Employees of a modeling agency begin turning up dead, all victims of a leather-clad motorcycle-helmeted killer.  In between, models Edwige Fenech, Femi Benussi and Solvi Stubing, along with photographer Nino Castelnuovo enjoy cavorting around in front of, behind, below and underneath the camera - until, that is, the killings get too close and people begin to wonder who's next.There is an interesting interview included in this Blue Underground edition with co-writer Massimo Felisatti who talks about the film and the director, Bianchi.  While he never comes out and says it plainly, it seemed that Mr. Felisatti thought that Bianchi had gone too far in this film.  While I think that that was probably true at the time the film was released, other than the opening scene, I doubt there's anything here too troubling now - unless gratuitous full-frontal nudity and violent murder scenes are a problem for anyone.  If they are, I'd wonder why they were watching 'Strip Nude for your Killer' in the first place.Unfortunately, despite his effort to shoehorn in as much sex and violence into the film as possible, director Bianchi misses the mark here somehow.  In fact, detouring away from the storyline in order to showcase Femi Benussi and Edwige Fenech only let the air out of any building tension.  It also made it difficult to follow some of the finer elements of the plot, though the resolution still didn't seem terribly surprising when it came.  Even though it's always a pleasure to watch Ms. Fenech and Ms. Benussi, as a complete film, it doesn't rise above mediocre - which is a shame for such an attention getting title.  As an example of Giallo, it probably checks all the right boxes, but it seems as though there must be better yardsticks out there for the genre.  On the other hand, those looking simply for some unadulterated trashy fun from 1970's Italy are certainly in luck.

936510,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B000B64TZK,Dave. K,"[2, 2]","Strip Nude for Your Killer was a rather solid Giallo, but also very flawed at the same time. There are plenty of really well-done moments, but it also takes a while before we get to them. Strip Nude for Your Killer starts off a bit slow with the introduction of the characters, none of which were all that interesting. Though once we get to about the 25-min mark the movie does begin to pick up.Based on a story by Andrea Bianchi, the screenplay was written by Massimo Felisatti, the screenplay is your standard Giallo; Nothing here really stands-out from the norm; though with that said the movie isn't badly written. While the characters lack depth, the mystery aspect is actually pretty good. The investigation scenes work rather well, but it's just the filler scenes that don't work quite as well.Director Andrea Bianchi is able to create some tension, but some of his scenes can drag. The highlight of the movie comes around the 30-min mark the stalk scene was very well done and quite creepy. If only the rest of the movie could have been like that it would have been much better. That's not to say Strip Nude for Your Killer is a bad movie it is actually overall pretty good, but when there are no stalking scenes and when it's not about the investigation some of the scenes lack at times.The final act Andrea Bianchi does manage to deliver some solid tension and atmosphere despite the fact the movie does drag along in the final act. Strip Nude for Your Killer is one of the more sleazy Giallos you can except plenty of nudity and sex scenes while a movie doesn't need that this one did. Take that away and Strip Nude for Your Killer wouldn't work quite as much as it does. The women were good looking so I don't mind, but I couldn't help but feel Bianchi was more interested on sex and nudity rather than suspense, while Strip Nude for Your Killer has some solid tension I couldn't help but feel it could have been so much more.Strip Nude for Your Killer was one of the many Giallos to feature the stunningly beautiful Edwige Fenech. I don't know if you will find a woman more beautiful than Edwige and that also goes for now. Even at 59-years old she is still amazingly beautiful. If you are a fan of Giallos and or Edwige Fenech than by all means check out Strip Nude for Your Killer.In closing, the movie does suffer from some pacing problems and there are moments where the movie seems to drag, but despite those problems the movie works rather well.",3,"Great title, decent movie",1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,2464,"['Strip', 'Nude', 'Killer', 'was', 'rather', 'solid', 'Giallo', 'also', 'very', 'flawed', 'same', 'time', 'are', 'plenty', 'really', 'well-done', 'moments', 'also', 'while', 'get', 'Strip', 'Nude', 'Your', 'Killer', 'bit', 'slow', 'introduction', 'characters', 'none', 'were', 'interesting', 'once', 'get', '25-min', 'mark', 'movie', 'begin', 'pick', 'up.Based', 'story', 'Andrea', 'Bianchi', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Massimo', 'Felisatti', 'screenplay', 'standard', 'Giallo', 'Nothing', 'here', 'really', 'stands-out', 'norm', 'said', 'movie', ""n't"", 'badly', 'written', 'characters', 'lack', 'depth', 'mystery', 'aspect', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'investigation', 'work', 'rather', 'well', 'just', 'filler', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'quite', 'well.Director', 'Andrea', 'Bianchi', 'able', 'create', 'tension', 'scenes', 'can', 'drag', 'highlight', 'movie', '30-min', 'mark', 'stalk', 'scene', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'quite', 'creepy', 'only', 'rest', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'not', 'say', 'Strip', 'Nude', 'Killer', 'bad', 'movie', 'actually', 'overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'when', 'are', 'stalking', 'scenes', 'when', 'not', 'investigation', 'scenes', 'lack', 'times.The', 'final', 'act', 'Andrea', 'Bianchi', 'manage', 'deliver', 'solid', 'tension', 'atmosphere', 'fact', 'movie', 'drag', 'final', 'act', 'Strip', 'Nude', 'Killer', 'one', 'more', 'sleazy', 'Giallos', 'can', 'except', 'plenty', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'movie', ""n't"", 'need', 'one', 'did', 'Take', 'away', 'Strip', 'Nude', 'Your', 'Killer', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'women', 'were', 'good', 'looking', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'Bianchi', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'sex', 'nudity', 'rather', 'suspense', 'Strip', 'Nude', 'Your', 'Killer', 'solid', 'tension', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more.Strip', 'Nude', 'Killer', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'Giallos', 'feature', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Edwige', 'Fenech', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'find', 'woman', 'more', 'beautiful', 'Edwige', 'also', 'now', 'Even', '59-years', 'old', 'still', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'are', 'fan', 'Giallos', 'Edwige', 'Fenech', 'means', 'check', 'out', 'Strip', 'Nude', 'Killer.In', 'closing', 'movie', 'suffer', 'pacing', 'problems', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'movie', 'drag', 'problems', 'movie', 'rather', 'well']",N/A

The coverbox promises more than the film delivers(plus the artwork is great).  It's about a killer in motorcycle gear that kills fashion(Turn To The Left!!) models.  Ya know, typical giallo stuff, but the whole model thing is too close to Bava's Blood and Black Lace.  This was directed by Andrea Bianchi, who as everyone knows, gave us the box office smash, Burial Ground.  Since that film was so silly and out there, I figured this would have a touch of that lunacy as well.  I mean, how can you go wrong with a killer in a motorcycle helmet killing nude chicks(that is if you forget Nail Gun Massacre exists)?  Strangely the film is a tad boring.  It's got a decent amount of bloodletting, moreso than alot of giallos of the time.  It's got that funky soundtrack we all love.

And if we can forgive Nino for his implication with the death resulting from the abortion attempt at the beginning of the film and the aside that he may have been the father and the ending of the film where Ms. Fenech objects to his implication that its better that they think of protection.  Screenwriter Massimo Felisatti says in an interview on Blue Underground's Blu-ray disc that they had wanted to add director Andrea Bianchi as a co-screenwriter to take some of the responsibility for the content of the film from themselves, especially Felisatti, as the director went &#34;too far&#34; with what they had devised for the story.  Bianchi must have loved American cinema as he tries very hard to Americanize the characters Fenech and Castelnuovo play as a &#34;sleuthy&#34; duo, but it does not work totally as most of the film is just Euro-sleaze and not a very good giallo, although it took the plot directly from the granddad of the giallo, the film that wrote down the blueprint for the giallo: Mario Bava's &#34;Blood and Black Lace.&#34;  But where that film put &#34;art&#34; first, this film puts back the &#34;trash&#34; in Euro-trash. But it's a nice attempt to have Edwige and Nino headlining a decent attempt at entertainment.
