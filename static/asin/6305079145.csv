447559,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,6305079145,David E. Levine,"[4, 9]","I remember this production being televised in the mid 1980s and what impressed me was that it was done on a set rather than on a stage. There was no audience, so it was basically a movie of an opera rather than a video of a stage performance. I don't know, if, as in the making of movies, there were multiple takes until the producer (Franco Zeffirelli) and director (James Levine) were satisfied or if it was recorded straight through, as a stage production would be. Regardless, I think the movie style production worked extraordinarily well. Such a production allows for great cinematography, such as closeups of the facial expressions of the singers and switching camera angles, etc.Stratas is compelling, her performance both vocal and acting is moving. Her facial expressions indicate that she truly feels the role as a great movie actress would. Obviously, in casting an opera, paramount is the artistic ability of the performer, not the physical characteristcs. Thus, ""the fat lady"" often sings when if her character were cast in a play or movie, someone younger and more demur would be tapped to play the role. The reason that this movie style production works so well is because Stratas is well cast as Mimi. She is beautiful and her acting is magnificent.Renata Scotto, as Musetta does a convincing job. Her voice was always wonderful. In fact, around the time that this production was filmed, I had seen her in Adriana Lecouvrer at the Metropolitan Opera. I know that this is a huge digression but, I must mention that Scotto was quite a prima donna. You should have seen her well practiced curtseys and bows during the curtain call. Anyway, suffice it to say that a cast that includes Scotto as well as Jose Carreras makes this an all star production. As I noted earlier, the suitability of the singer to the role as an actor is crucial in staging an opera in this manner (as opposed to running the camera while it os performed on stage) but, when this type of production works, it works extraordinarily well. To me, this production is a grand slam.",5,Great cinematography,1109721600,"03 2, 2005",2005,2062,"['remember', 'production', 'being', 'televised', 'mid', '1980s', 'what', 'impressed', 'was', 'was', 'done', 'set', 'rather', 'stage', 'was', 'audience', 'was', 'basically', 'movie', 'opera', 'rather', 'video', 'stage', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'making', 'movies', 'were', 'multiple', 'producer', 'Franco', 'Zeffirelli', 'director', 'James', 'Levine', 'were', 'satisfied', 'was', 'recorded', 'straight', 'through', 'stage', 'production', 'would', 'be', 'Regardless', 'think', 'movie', 'style', 'production', 'worked', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'production', 'great', 'cinematography', 'such', 'closeups', 'facial', 'expressions', 'singers', 'switching', 'camera', 'angles', 'etc.Stratas', 'compelling', 'performance', 'vocal', 'acting', 'moving', 'facial', 'expressions', 'indicate', 'truly', 'feels', 'role', 'great', 'movie', 'actress', 'would', 'Obviously', 'casting', 'opera', 'paramount', 'artistic', 'ability', 'performer', 'not', 'physical', 'characteristcs', 'Thus', 'fat', 'lady', 'often', 'when', 'character', 'were', 'cast', 'play', 'movie', 'someone', 'younger', 'more', 'demur', 'would', 'be', 'tapped', 'play', 'role', 'reason', 'movie', 'style', 'production', 'so', 'well', 'Stratas', 'well', 'cast', 'Mimi', 'beautiful', 'acting', 'magnificent.Renata', 'Scotto', 'Musetta', 'convincing', 'job', 'voice', 'was', 'always', 'wonderful', 'fact', 'time', 'production', 'was', 'filmed', 'had', 'seen', 'Adriana', 'Lecouvrer', 'Metropolitan', 'Opera', 'know', 'huge', 'digression', 'must', 'mention', 'Scotto', 'was', 'quite', 'prima', 'donna', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'well', 'practiced', 'curtseys', 'bows', 'curtain', 'call', 'Anyway', 'suffice', 'say', 'cast', 'Scotto', 'as', 'well', 'Jose', 'Carreras', 'star', 'production', 'noted', 'earlier', 'suitability', 'singer', 'role', 'actor', 'crucial', 'staging', 'opera', 'manner', 'opposed', 'running', 'camera', 'performed', 'stage', 'when', 'type', 'production', 'works', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'production', 'grand', 'slam']",N/A
447560,AAT2JIIADQDUP,6305079145,"DJ McGovern ""Derek McGovern""","[42, 44]","I thoroughly enjoyed this 1982 Zeffirelli production from the Met. It has much to recommend it: passionate singing from the underrated Jose Carreras, terrific acting from Teresa Stratas, an excellent supporting cast, great sets and direction, and first-rate conducting from James Levine.I bought this DVD primarily because of Carreras, and it's a treat to hear him before the onset of his illness and vocal problems. True, he is pushing a little here at times, but his ravishing timbre more than compensates. Pavarotti may have the freer high notes, but Carreras' performance has a passion that most other interpreters lack. By his own admission not the world's greatest actor, he is nevertheless convincing as a young, idealistic poet, and this (along with Stiffelio, Don Jose and Andrea Chenier) ranks as one of his best roles. My only quibble is that he is a little hammy during Mimi's death scene (though few tenors can probably resist such a temptation!)Teresa Statas is the consummate actress, and there is not one moment when her portrayal of Mimi does not ring entirely true. I was unable to hold back the tears during her aria in Act Three, so heartbreaking was her farewell to Rodolfo. Interestingly, she makes her impression without the benefit of a magnificent voice. This is a singing actress rather than a vocal great. Her voice strikes me as somewhat plain of timbre, lacking the beauty of, say, a Mirella Freni, but in this performance, at least, it simply doesn't matter. Her Mimi will stay with you for a long time. (I do, however, agree with one amazon reviewer who thought she looked too ill from the outset. The over-zealous make-up artist should have shown some restraint!)Renata Scotto, in the role of Musetta, has a larger vocal presence, despite a wobbly vibrato when she's under pressure. Hers is a good overall performance, and her comic skills in Act Two add much to the liveliness of the Cafe Scene.The rest of the cast was uniformly good, and the amusing horseplay between the four young Bohemians in Acts 1 and 4 was a real delight. Richard Stilwell as Marcello is outstanding in the reconciliation scene with Musetta in Act 2, and later in his duet (O Mimi, piu non torni) in Act 4 with Carreras.The sound quality is fine, and I had no problem with the slightly dark (but highly atmospheric) visuals.Overall, an excellent Boheme with much to recommend it. (And while you're about it, do check out the 1982 Covent Garden performance with Neil Shicoff and Ileana Cotrubas for an equally well-acted Boheme.)",4,Top-notch production with just a few reservations...,1005264000,"11 9, 2001",2001,2536,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', '1982', 'Zeffirelli', 'production', 'Met', 'much', 'recommend', 'passionate', 'singing', 'underrated', 'Jose', 'Carreras', 'terrific', 'acting', 'Teresa', 'Stratas', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'sets', 'direction', 'first-rate', 'conducting', 'James', 'Levine.I', 'bought', 'DVD', 'primarily', 'Carreras', 'treat', 'hear', 'onset', 'illness', 'vocal', 'problems', 'True', 'pushing', 'little', 'here', 'times', 'ravishing', 'timbre', 'more', 'compensates', 'Pavarotti', 'may', 'have', 'freer', 'high', 'notes', 'Carreras', 'performance', 'passion', 'most', 'other', 'interpreters', 'lack', 'own', 'admission', 'not', 'world', 'greatest', 'actor', 'nevertheless', 'convincing', 'young', 'idealistic', 'poet', 'Stiffelio', 'Don', 'Jose', 'Andrea', 'Chenier', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'only', 'quibble', 'little', 'hammy', 'Mimi', 'death', 'scene', 'few', 'tenors', 'can', 'probably', 'resist', 'such', 'temptation', 'Teresa', 'Statas', 'consummate', 'actress', 'not', 'one', 'moment', 'when', 'portrayal', 'Mimi', 'not', 'ring', 'entirely', 'true', 'was', 'unable', 'hold', 'back', 'tears', 'aria', 'Act', 'Three', 'heartbreaking', 'was', 'farewell', 'Rodolfo', 'Interestingly', 'impression', 'benefit', 'magnificent', 'voice', 'singing', 'actress', 'rather', 'vocal', 'great', 'voice', 'strikes', 'somewhat', 'plain', 'timbre', 'lacking', 'beauty', 'say', 'Mirella', 'Freni', 'performance', 'least', 'simply', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Mimi', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time', 'do', 'however', 'agree', 'one', 'amazon', 'reviewer', 'who', 'thought', 'looked', 'too', 'ill', 'outset', 'over-zealous', 'make-up', 'artist', 'should', 'have', 'shown', 'restraint', 'Renata', 'Scotto', 'role', 'Musetta', 'larger', 'vocal', 'presence', 'wobbly', 'vibrato', 'when', 'pressure', 'Hers', 'good', 'overall', 'performance', 'comic', 'skills', 'Act', 'Two', 'add', 'much', 'liveliness', 'Cafe', 'Scene.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'uniformly', 'good', 'amusing', 'horseplay', 'four', 'young', 'Bohemians', 'Acts', '1', '4', 'was', 'real', 'delight', 'Richard', 'Stilwell', 'Marcello', 'outstanding', 'reconciliation', 'scene', 'Musetta', 'Act', '2', 'later', 'duet', 'O', 'Mimi', 'piu', 'non', 'torni', 'Act', '4', 'Carreras.The', 'sound', 'quality', 'fine', 'had', 'problem', 'slightly', 'dark', 'highly', 'atmospheric', 'visuals.Overall', 'excellent', 'Boheme', 'much', 'recommend', ""'re"", 'do', 'check', '1982', 'Covent', 'Garden', 'performance', 'Neil', 'Shicoff', 'Ileana', 'Cotrubas', 'equally', 'well-acted', 'Boheme']",N/A

All of the singers sing well and act well, Miss Stratas in particular, but there seems to be no real relationships built up during the course of the opera, so that in the final scene the only thing that made me cry was the emotional soaring of Puccini's music, not that Rodolfo had finally lost his beloved Mimi.

447565,AV7Z25U0HUGTU,6305079145,N. Gallimore,"[52, 58]","This version of La Boheme has never been available in England, at least I  have never been able to track down a copy.  I actually bought the DVD  directly from the Met opera shop, ask for Jack and he will give you all the  advice you need, although I should warn you that it is much cheaper to buy  it from amazon.com.  Even more so if you live in Europe, because the  shipping is much less from amazon. I have always loved San Francisco's  Boheme, probably because I am obsessed with Pavarotti and Freni, and I do  believe that this is the most beautifully sung Boheme available on DVD.  However, if you are after an emotive and perfectly executed Boheme in which  the performers and production get right under the skin, of what can be very  &quot;card board cut out characters&quot;, then look no further than this  Met production.  Teresa Stratus has by no stretch of the imagination a  beautiful voice, but her acting and total commitment and understanding of  the role of Mimi counteract this.  She delivers her line at the end of her  Act I aria &quot; Altro dime non le saprei narrare.&quot; absolutely  perfectly.  I have never seen anyone equal it; and her intense portrayal of  Mimi is full of moments like this.  Hers is a truly wonderful performance  and interpretation.  As is Carreras' Rodolfo.  I have always considered  Carreras to be the better actor of the three tenors, and although he can't  match their vocal splendour, he here gives the performance of a life time.  Mind you, try and get a copy of a VHS of him at La Scala in La Forza del  Destino - and you will see it again.  The rest of the cast, with the  exception of Scotto's Musetta, pale into insignificance against these two -  my only major critisism is &quot;why does James Morris look so absurd as  Colline&quot;?  The production by Zeffirelli is excellent.  So in  conclusion, if you want exemplary singing throughout - then go for San  Francisco's production with Pavarotti.  If you want a Boheme from the  heart, then the Met production is for you.

447567,AVWJFHLFGF42W,6305079145,"PhantomOfTheOpera ""Maria""","[6, 8]","I'm relatively new to opera, but still an ardent Carreras-fan who thinks his singing is heavenly and I think he makes a more than convincing Rodolfo here. And his looks at the time is certainly no drawback for him. His acting skills are in my opinion very good; his facial expressions projecting his feelings perfectly. (I prefer a subtle actor instead of someone overacting to compensate for poor voice.)It's heartbreaking watching and listening to him singing in the final scene where Mimi is dying. I can't help but being almost as crushed as him when he realizes that she's actually dead.Since I'm not an ""educated"" opera-listener I can't say it bothered me that he had transposed down ""che gelida manina"". His singing in act III is outstanding; the break-up between Mimi and Rodolfo is heart wrenching. I can feel Rodolfo's despair because he knows Mimi is dying. One of the things that bothered me somewhat in this Boheme is actually Mimi. Teresa Stratas' voice is not something I would call beautiful, by no means. And it disturbed me that she was rotating her tongue in her mouth whenever singing. But apart from that she's actually a sweet Mimi. In my opinion she's a much better actress than singer. And she certainly lookes ill enough for this part. In act IV the duet (O Mimi, tu piu non torni) between Rodolfo and Marcello is outstanding. The duets between Mimi and Rodolfo are also very moving.Renata Scotto was probably the biggest disappointment. I haven't seen her on stage before. To me she seems affected and I think she is just too much; especially in the second act. Her singing is not what I expected. She sounds shrill and squeaky, although I have to admit she sounds better towards the end of the opera.Richard Stilwell as Marcello is a gem. His singing as well as his acting is superb and he makes a very amiable painter. He is someone you would like being your friend. The two other Bohemians portrayed by Allan Monk and James Morris are superb. The ""coat song"" is beautifully sung by James Morris.I have watched this film a few times and each time I discover something new. I have to say I love just watching the facial expressions of the singers, especially the four bohemians'. Sometimes you just get a brief glimpse of it, but it's still hilarious. (Like the look on Carreras' face when the land-owner Benoit knocks on the door in the first act.) I'm sure I will discover a lot of other things about this Boheme the next time I watch it, which probably will be very soon. The more I watch, the more addicted to it I get.So my overall feeling here must be that this Boheme has a very good male cast, but the same thing can't be said about the sopranos. Where were Katia Ricciarelli and Agnes Baltsa at that time? Imagine them as Mimi and Musetta, respectively. Well, one can always dream......Still, I give this Boheme 5 stars.

Any of you who are used to the Carreras of the three tenors, will be  extremely surprized.  He sings with vivacity and dramatic timbre.  As for his vocals being suspect; 1982 was riddled with Carreras's wobbly performances.  This is the season following his taking on Trovatore, a much heavier role which took a toll on his voice. His singing here is, however, spectacular.  Che Gelida manina is transposed a half step down,  but this iis not unusual.  Domingo has always done it and Pavarotti does it on occasion as well.  Pavarotti mentions in his autobiography that the transposition down is standard.As for a comparison between pav and Carreras; there is no comparision.  The unconvincing acting of pavarotti can ruin a boheme on a Dvd with such focus.  Carreras is triumphant and portays his character brilliantly.  It is true, however that after 1981's romp through heroic tenor reperitiore Carreras was never the same.  His eyebrow began to warble and his high notes were no longer as free and glorious.  Nevertheless this Dvd is magnifisant.Even  if Carreras's dramatic timber isn't your cup of tea, he is supported by the fabulous voice of Stratas.  Occasionally her facial expressions bother you but the voice is in glorious condition.SEE THIS DVD,  It is entertainment at it's finest!",5,Bravo,1047859200,"03 17, 2003",2003,1368,"['am', 'disbelief', 'sommeone', 'rated', 'carreras', 'badly', 'la', 'boheme', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'Carreras', 'three', 'tenors', 'will', 'be', 'extremely', 'surprized', 'vivacity', 'dramatic', 'timbre', 'vocals', 'being', 'suspect', '1982', 'was', 'riddled', 'Carreras', 'wobbly', 'performances', 'season', 'following', 'taking', 'Trovatore', 'much', 'heavier', 'role', 'took', 'toll', 'voice', 'singing', 'here', 'however', 'spectacular', 'Che', 'Gelida', 'manina', 'transposed', 'half', 'step', 'down', 'not', 'unusual', 'Domingo', 'always', 'done', 'Pavarotti', 'occasion', 'well', 'Pavarotti', 'mentions', 'autobiography', 'transposition', 'down', 'standard.As', 'comparison', 'pav', 'Carreras', 'comparision', 'unconvincing', 'acting', 'pavarotti', 'can', 'ruin', 'boheme', 'Dvd', 'such', 'focus', 'Carreras', 'triumphant', 'character', 'brilliantly', 'true', 'however', '1981', 'romp', 'heroic', 'tenor', 'reperitiore', 'Carreras', 'was', 'never', 'same', 'eyebrow', 'began', 'warble', 'high', 'notes', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'free', 'glorious', 'Nevertheless', 'Dvd', 'magnifisant.Even', 'Carreras', 'dramatic', 'timber', ""n't"", 'cup', 'tea', 'supported', 'fabulous', 'voice', 'Stratas', 'Occasionally', 'facial', 'expressions', 'bother', 'voice', 'glorious', 'condition.SEE', 'THIS', 'DVD', 'entertainment', 'finest']",N/A
447571,A3N882HVOOPA2I,6305079145,Z. Yang,"[17, 27]","It puzzles me that words like ""standard"" or ""bench mark"" were used in praise of this La Boh'me. Just exactly what is the ""standard"" for this probably most popular opera? The originality of art is anything but to be constrained by some sort of standard. If the good words were for the singing, it still would be too lavish of a saying for this production, at least for ""Che gelida manina"", which was transposed down half a key, and even the replacing B is very short and not so exciting. There are indeed some really good singings, like Stilwell's Mercello. The singing of the two leading roles, however, leaves something to be desired. While Carreras' singing is quite dramatic, it feels that something was missing, not just the top C, but the lyrical sheen and exuberance that otherwise would flow through Rodolfo's vocal lines. Stratas has crafted a convincingly consumptive Mimi. But you'd hope she could bring a bit glow of liveliness to the character in the first two acts when Mimi was not yet too ill, after all Mimi should be a luminous figure. Stratas' lips are shaking noticeably (on DVD) when she sings, which makes you worry. Scotto played an impressive Musetta, and her great acting brought some enjoyable moments on stage.It is very interesting to compare this Zeffirelli's traditional and lavish production with other productions. Although it'll much depend on your taste to decide their effectiveness, among the numerous recordings and stage productions of La Boh'me, you wouldn't want to miss the 1972 studio recording with Pavarotti/Freni, conducted by Karajan, especially if singing is solely what you are looking for. If besides singing, you also want to experience some vigorous Bohemianism on stage and dramatic details revealed by great acting, you definitely want to check out Baz Luhrmann's production for Australian Opera, in which the sets are simple but visually stunning, the characters are sung by new generation singing actors/actresses in fabulous voices.",3,Just Another Boheme,1057795200,"07 10, 2003",2003,1987,"['words', 'standard', 'bench', 'mark', 'were', 'used', 'praise', 'La', ""Boh'me"", 'Just', 'exactly', 'what', 'standard', 'probably', 'most', 'popular', 'opera', 'originality', 'art', 'anything', 'be', 'constrained', 'sort', 'standard', 'good', 'words', 'were', 'singing', 'still', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'lavish', 'saying', 'production', 'least', 'Che', 'gelida', 'manina', 'was', 'transposed', 'down', 'key', 'even', 'replacing', 'B', 'very', 'short', 'not', 'so', 'exciting', 'are', 'indeed', 'really', 'good', 'singings', 'Stilwell', 'Mercello', 'singing', 'two', 'leading', 'roles', 'however', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'Carreras', 'singing', 'quite', 'dramatic', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'not', 'just', 'top', 'C', 'lyrical', 'sheen', 'exuberance', 'otherwise', 'would', 'flow', 'Rodolfo', 'vocal', 'lines', 'Stratas', 'crafted', 'convincingly', 'consumptive', 'Mimi', ""'d"", 'hope', 'could', 'bring', 'bit', 'glow', 'liveliness', 'character', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'when', 'Mimi', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'too', 'ill', 'Mimi', 'should', 'be', 'luminous', 'figure', 'Stratas', 'lips', 'are', 'shaking', 'noticeably', 'DVD', 'when', 'sings', 'worry', 'Scotto', 'played', 'impressive', 'Musetta', 'great', 'acting', 'brought', 'enjoyable', 'moments', 'stage.It', 'very', 'interesting', 'compare', 'Zeffirelli', 'traditional', 'lavish', 'production', 'other', 'productions', ""'ll"", 'much', 'depend', 'taste', 'decide', 'effectiveness', 'numerous', 'recordings', 'stage', 'productions', 'La', ""Boh'me"", 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', '1972', 'studio', 'recording', 'Pavarotti/Freni', 'conducted', 'Karajan', 'especially', 'singing', 'solely', 'what', 'are', 'looking', 'singing', 'also', 'want', 'experience', 'vigorous', 'Bohemianism', 'stage', 'dramatic', 'details', 'revealed', 'great', 'acting', 'definitely', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'Baz', 'Luhrmann', 'production', 'Australian', 'Opera', 'sets', 'are', 'simple', 'visually', 'stunning', 'characters', 'are', 'sung', 'new', 'generation', 'singing', 'actors/actresses', 'fabulous', 'voices']",N/A
