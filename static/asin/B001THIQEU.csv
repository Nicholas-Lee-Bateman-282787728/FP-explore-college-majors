1236399,A2ROMLWDF5V2MV,B001THIQEU,Chris Harvey,"[0, 0]",This has impacted me a lot. It has comedy and hilarious scenes in it. It's all about how Jeff made the show. He works for a trucking company that does  a lot of shipping. The shipper was very fast and prompt with the shipping. They gave me a tracking number for it and so I will order from them again. Cause this was a gift for my dad.,5,I love Jeff Foxowrothy.

I couldn't even watch two episodes, it wasn't really funny, it seemed like it was trying to hard to be a family comedy but fell flat.

We were alittle surprised the entire Second Season was so different from the First Season but both Seasons were very funny.  Too bad the show ended after the Second Season - I think the way the Second Season last show finished it would have made a very interesting & enjoyable Third Season if the show had gotten that chance.
