444517,A2DS7LJI7I58O7,6305021368,Chris,"[0, 0]","This is a good workout that requires the use of toning cords.  Looks deceptively easy, but gives a good workout!  It's around fourty minutes long, and I like that like most of his videos, he includes a variety of people of different sizes and at different levels of fitness.  Makes you feel more at ease and like you're at a ""real""  workout, not working out with taped ""models"".  Plus, it gives you the opportunity to view the workout at different levels of intensity, so you can modify it to your own situation!  Just wish they would release all of these workouts on dvd!",5,A Good Workout,1201737600,"01 31, 2008",2008,572,"['good', 'workout', 'use', 'toning', 'cords', 'Looks', 'deceptively', 'easy', 'good', 'workout', 'fourty', 'minutes', 'long', 'like', 'most', 'videos', 'variety', 'people', 'different', 'sizes', 'different', 'levels', 'fitness', 'Makes', 'feel', 'more', 'ease', ""'re"", 'real', 'workout', 'not', 'working', 'out', 'taped', 'models', 'opportunity', 'view', 'workout', 'different', 'levels', 'intensity', 'can', 'modify', 'own', 'situation', 'Just', 'wish', 'would', 'release', 'workouts', 'dvd']",Tone & Sweat VHS

It is realistic.  Anyone can do it.  My husband is in the Army and he wants his soldiers to do it, because he feels it is that great!!!!  We do it every day, not because we have to, but because we feel so much more energy when we do.  Anyone can find time for this one as it is VERY short.  Only about 30 min and that is counting the time he takes to instruct you on how to use the toning cord.  You can fast forward that part after you fully understand.Best excercise video out there today!!!!!!!!!

My husband bought it a few years ago and when I wanted to lose weight and get toned up, I decided to give it a try - with great skepticism.  I'll admit I was wrong - this is a great tape and Richard Simmons is inspirational, motivational and just funny.This tape uses toning cords and is about 40 minutes in length.  While people criticize his lack of queuing, this particular routine is fairly simple and moves slowly enough through the exercises that when you use it the first time or two, you don't miss but maybe one repetition while watching to see what to do.  After you've done it a few times, you don't need the advance queuing and it's almost a relief not to have a lot of queuing.I'm now in the process of buying other Richard Simmons tapes/DVD's because his routines are fun and he's inspirational and motivational.Since using his tape - in addition to a treadmill, I've lost weight and am seeing results in toning in areas of my body that I've never been able to reach - like my back and shoulders and have more upper body strength.  I've had the worst arms in the world my entire life, but have watched them get tighter and now begin to get some defintion - this is major!  I'm also using his Blast and Tone DVD, which uses weights, and recommend that as well.I really recommend this for anyone who wants to start an exercise program but may be a little reluctant to start out with weights - or anyone who wants to tone.  I'm a Simmons convert - and I was a tough sell.  It's fun, the time goes by quickly and you'll feel and see the results if you stick with it!!",5,Great Toning Workout !,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,1687,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'using', 'tape', '5', 'months', 'think', 'not', 'only', 'great', 'toning', 'workout', 'fun', 'use', 'husband', 'bought', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'wanted', 'lose', 'weight', 'get', 'toned', 'up', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'great', 'skepticism', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'wrong', 'great', 'tape', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'inspirational', 'motivational', 'just', 'funny.This', 'tape', 'toning', 'cords', 'about', '40', 'minutes', 'length', 'people', 'criticize', 'lack', 'queuing', 'particular', 'routine', 'fairly', 'simple', 'moves', 'slowly', 'enough', 'exercises', 'when', 'use', 'first', 'time', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'maybe', 'one', 'repetition', 'watching', 'see', 'what', 'do', ""'ve"", 'done', 'few', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'advance', 'queuing', 'almost', 'relief', 'not', 'have', 'lot', 'queuing.I', ""'m"", 'now', 'process', 'buying', 'other', 'Richard', 'Simmons', 'tapes/DVD', 'routines', 'are', 'fun', 'inspirational', 'motivational.Since', 'using', 'tape', 'addition', 'treadmill', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'weight', 'am', 'seeing', 'results', 'toning', 'areas', 'body', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'able', 'reach', 'back', 'shoulders', 'have', 'more', 'upper', 'body', 'strength', ""'ve"", 'had', 'worst', 'arms', 'world', 'entire', 'life', 'have', 'watched', 'get', 'tighter', 'now', 'begin', 'get', 'defintion', 'major', ""'m"", 'also', 'using', 'Blast', 'Tone', 'DVD', 'weights', 'recommend', 'well.I', 'really', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'start', 'exercise', 'program', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'reluctant', 'start', 'out', 'weights', 'anyone', 'who', 'tone', ""'m"", 'Simmons', 'convert', 'was', 'tough', 'sell', 'fun', 'time', 'quickly', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'see', 'results', 'stick']",Tone & Sweat VHS

Although the toning it isn't as  thorough as his Uptown/Downtown tapes, this is more intense with more reps.  With Richard, it's a good idea to get form pointers from other instructors  (like keeping your wrists straight, taxing your muscles without over-taxing  them, keeping your knees over your ankles). But when you use correct form,  this workout is extremely effective. It's more serious than his other  tapes, but he's as supportive as ever. If you're a beginner, you'll be  surprised when you accomplish all the reps because of his encouragement.  Doing this tape will help you build muscle fast!",4,A surprisingly tough routine,965260800,"08 3, 2000",2000,640,"['one', 'quite', 'workout', 'toning', ""n't"", 'as', 'thorough', 'Uptown/Downtown', 'tapes', 'more', 'intense', 'more', 'reps.', 'Richard', 'good', 'idea', 'get', 'form', 'pointers', 'other', 'instructors', 'keeping', 'wrists', 'straight', 'taxing', 'muscles', 'over-taxing', 'keeping', 'knees', 'ankles', 'when', 'use', 'correct', 'form', 'workout', 'extremely', 'effective', 'more', 'serious', 'other', 'tapes', 'as', 'supportive', 'ever', ""'re"", 'beginner', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'accomplish', 'reps', 'encouragement', 'Doing', 'tape', 'will', 'help', 'build', 'fast']",Tone & Sweat VHS
