1152108,AGEIT17HENDIS,B001662FIW,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","No question, no question at all that it was tough, tough as hell, to be a woman with executive level skills, CEO-type skills in the international diamond business then based in London, or any business for that matter, in the 1960s. But what were you, that woman, to do about it, except endlessly smoke cigarettes and fume. No question, no question at all that the private health insurance racket for serious illnesses in England, or anywhere for that matter, is predicated on providing the least possible help for the sick when all is said and done. Those two hurts, the first held by Demi Moore, the other by Michael Caine (in about his twelve millionth film) around the treatment of his dead wife is what drives the plotline in this film under review, Flawless (as in flawless diamonds or flawless plan, I assume).Naturally, naturally for a suspense thriller these hurts can only be resolved by action, here by criminal action. See Michael, a janitor at the London Diamond Exchange, recruits Demi, a middle- level executive there to a plan that he has cooked up to get revenge for his wife's death on the insurance executive whose policy didn't provide the expected coverage when she developed cancer.  And as part of the package help Demi get even for being passed over when promotion time came up and some lesser guy, lesser male got pushed ahead in that old rat race.The plan: steal a few million dollars in diamonds from the vast haul in the vault as restitution. Hell, their disappearance would never be noticed. He says. And the damn plan worked, worked real well. Except in the end though Michael had a bigger political objective, to ruin that insurance company so he ingeniously stole the contents of the whole vault and held it ransom. And the ransom after much hemming and hawing was paid. Nice work. Except that was not Michael's point in this caper and so Demi wound up with the 100 million dollar ransom which she spent the rest of her life trying to give away to various charities. Yah, I know, far-fetched but what isn't far-fetched is that for once crime did pay, did pay for the side of the angels for a change.",4,Flawless Plan,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,2130,"['question', 'question', 'was', 'tough', 'tough', 'hell', 'be', 'woman', 'executive', 'level', 'skills', 'CEO-type', 'skills', 'international', 'diamond', 'business', 'then', 'based', 'London', 'business', 'matter', '1960s', 'what', 'were', 'woman', 'do', 'endlessly', 'smoke', 'cigarettes', 'fume', 'question', 'question', 'private', 'health', 'insurance', 'racket', 'serious', 'illnesses', 'England', 'anywhere', 'matter', 'predicated', 'providing', 'least', 'possible', 'help', 'sick', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'two', 'hurts', 'first', 'held', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'other', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'twelve', 'millionth', 'film', 'treatment', 'dead', 'wife', 'what', 'plotline', 'film', 'review', 'Flawless', 'flawless', 'diamonds', 'flawless', 'plan', 'assume', '.Naturally', 'naturally', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'hurts', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'resolved', 'action', 'here', 'criminal', 'action', 'See', 'Michael', 'janitor', 'London', 'Diamond', 'Exchange', 'Demi', 'middle-', 'level', 'executive', 'there', 'plan', 'cooked', 'up', 'get', 'revenge', 'wife', 'death', 'insurance', 'executive', 'policy', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'expected', 'coverage', 'when', 'developed', 'cancer', 'part', 'package', 'help', 'Demi', 'get', 'even', 'being', 'passed', 'when', 'promotion', 'time', 'came', 'up', 'lesser', 'guy', 'lesser', 'male', 'got', 'pushed', 'ahead', 'old', 'rat', 'race.The', 'plan', 'steal', 'few', 'million', 'dollars', 'diamonds', 'vast', 'haul', 'vault', 'restitution', 'Hell', 'disappearance', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'noticed', 'damn', 'plan', 'worked', 'worked', 'real', 'well', 'end', 'Michael', 'had', 'bigger', 'political', 'objective', 'ruin', 'insurance', 'company', 'so', 'ingeniously', 'stole', 'contents', 'whole', 'vault', 'held', 'ransom', 'ransom', 'much', 'hemming', 'hawing', 'was', 'paid', 'Nice', 'work', 'was', 'not', 'Michael', 'point', 'caper', 'so', 'Demi', 'wound', 'up', '100', 'million', 'dollar', 'ransom', 'spent', 'rest', 'life', 'trying', 'give', 'away', 'various', 'charities', 'Yah', 'know', 'far-fetched', 'what', ""n't"", 'far-fetched', 'once', 'crime', 'did', 'pay', 'did', 'pay', 'side', 'angels', 'change']",Flawless

1152111,A1N134HXXST079,B001662FIW,"Baking Enthusiast ""Liza""","[9, 11]","Heist films invariably follow a formula of sorts--there's the Plan, the Execution, and the Getaway.  These are the elements that provide the fun in watching capers to begin with.  The cleverer these elements, the more fun.  In ""Flawless,"" the plan requires no maps, no tunneling, no gizmos, and no crew; heck, not even a getaway car.  The execution is nothing more than opening an impenetrable vault, and the getaway is...well, it simply requires the elderly thief to hobble away and shuffle on home.Not a flawless gem, but a gem nonetheless, ""Flawless"" is an entertaining romp through 1960s London where a clever and extremely profitable jewel heist is perpetrated by two unlikely partners in crime.  Michael Caine stars as Mr. Hobbs, a long-time janitor at London Diamond Corporation, a distributor of diamonds to six continents.  Mr. Hobbs will be retiring soon and would like a healthier nest egg than what his pension will provide.  In same company is Demi Moore as Laura Quinn, a career-driven, Oxford-educated manager whose lacquered coiffure can't penetrate the proverbial glass ceiling despite her dedication and brains.  Soon to be ousted, she's persuaded by Hobbs to be his accomplice in the theft of a mere Thermos-ful of stones, just enough to make them both rich, but not enough to make a noticeable dent in Lon Di's two-ton inventory of uncut diamonds.There's far more to this story than meets the eye and we'd be mistaken to think that it's all about the money.  Hobbs' true motivation and the cleverness of the actual heist will surprise.  The film also attempts to inject some social awareness in here, what with the exploitation of S. Africa for its diamonds and the popularity of the film `Blood Diamond.'  It's not for nothing that Hobbs, when speaking about his desire to enrich his underfunded retirement, remarks, ""War and plunder--two reliable sources of income.""  These brief forays into political correctness do not impress, though, and seem oddly ill-advised since they're not dealt with in any meaningful way.The film moves along at a nice, steady pace, neither plodding nor frenetic, and dutifully provides the requisite thrills and plot twists of a heist film.  Caine is no Steve McQueen and Moore is no Faye Dunaway, but it's still an elegant and stylish film that evokes a `60s coolness, ciggy-smoking included, set to the equally cool Dave Brubeck Quartet and their ""Take Five"" jazz piece.  As expected, Caine is a joy to watch in his cockney role (which he can probably do in his sleep).  Moore, now mature and fully-clothed, is classy albeit with a British accent that comes and goes at will.  Together, they're an incongruous but likeable pair, and likeability here is crucial.

The big boys take themselves a little too seriously, there is all of the chain smoking and polished wingtips, and two unlikely partners in crime.  Michael Caine is great as the invisible shuffling janitor in the background, Mr. Hobbs, who patiently and long-sufferingly does the night cleanup.  And Demi Moore, as Laura Quinn, the only female manager of the evil diamond company, who has not only been passed over and over again, but about to be axed.  The two team up to steal a few stones, and get back at the company.  But the plot falls apart for Ms. Quinn when it became apparent to her that Mr. Hobbs has not let her know the exact reason and extent of his plans.  She becomes frantic, guilt and betrayal written all over her face, while being investigated by a detective (Finch) who shows a slight romantic interest in her, while she shows too much interest in the investigation.  The cat/mouse game ends when Finch figures out that Laura and Mr. Hobbs had been seen together, and a panicking Laura attempts to find out what Mr. Hobbs has done with the diamonds.  He only assures her that everything is under control.  But Laura panicks and the gig is almost up as Finch closes in.Laura eventually figures out the scheme, and answers Mr. Hobbs question, ""Are you a giver or a taker?"" and moving onto the rest of her life without the glass ceiling.  Here Mr. Hobbs is like a fairy godfather who solves Ms. Quinn's problems and sets her free to fulfill her destiny.Not to give away the plot, just suffice it to say, that the symbolism of what Mr. Hobbs does with the diamonds is about the funniest thing, as well as the last minute disposal of one magnificant stone.  Just as he leaves his shift, he is called back in a suspenseful moment (leading the audience to think that he is being caught), only to have someone hand him a plunger and ask him to clear the commode.",4,"Comical Heist, Michael Caine is a Gem",1217376000,"07 30, 2008",2008,1984,"['film', 'pretended', 'seriousness', 'political', 'social', 'correctness', 'really', 'quite', 'comical', 'big', 'boys', 'take', 'little', 'too', 'seriously', 'chain', 'smoking', 'polished', 'wingtips', 'two', 'unlikely', 'partners', 'crime', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'great', 'invisible', 'shuffling', 'janitor', 'background', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'who', 'patiently', 'long-sufferingly', 'night', 'cleanup', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'Laura', 'Quinn', 'only', 'female', 'manager', 'evil', 'diamond', 'company', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'been', 'passed', 'over', 'again', 'be', 'axed', 'two', 'team', 'up', 'steal', 'few', 'stones', 'get', 'back', 'company', 'plot', 'apart', 'Ms.', 'Quinn', 'when', 'became', 'apparent', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'not', 'let', 'know', 'exact', 'reason', 'extent', 'plans', 'frantic', 'guilt', 'betrayal', 'written', 'face', 'being', 'investigated', 'detective', 'Finch', 'who', 'slight', 'romantic', 'interest', 'too', 'much', 'interest', 'investigation', 'cat/mouse', 'game', 'when', 'Finch', 'out', 'Laura', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'had', 'been', 'seen', 'together', 'panicking', 'Laura', 'attempts', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'done', 'diamonds', 'only', 'everything', 'control', 'Laura', 'panicks', 'gig', 'almost', 'up', 'Finch', 'closes', 'in.Laura', 'eventually', 'out', 'scheme', 'answers', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'question', 'Are', 'giver', 'taker', 'moving', 'rest', 'life', 'glass', 'ceiling', 'Here', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'fairy', 'godfather', 'who', 'Ms.', 'Quinn', 'problems', 'free', 'fulfill', 'destiny.Not', 'give', 'away', 'plot', 'just', 'suffice', 'say', 'symbolism', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Hobbs', 'diamonds', 'funniest', 'thing', 'as', 'well', 'last', 'minute', 'disposal', 'one', 'magnificant', 'stone', 'Just', 'shift', 'called', 'back', 'suspenseful', 'moment', 'leading', 'audience', 'think', 'being', 'caught', 'only', 'have', 'someone', 'hand', 'plunger', 'ask', 'clear', 'commode']",Flawless

I have never met Moore and can't comment on that aspect, if for no other reason than I don't know if the rumours are well-founded. Her off-screen persona did sometimes come off as the direct antithesis of someone like Audrey Hepburn who always distanced herself from her own fame. Especially when she was married to Willis, Moore appeared to drink in the spotlight of Hollywood fame like an alcoholic reaching for another vodka. Now her star has dimmed somewhat which has allowed her to do what she does best: simply act in high-quality entertaining projects. The main reason Moore has been where she is has to do with her ability as an actress, not her celebrity. In the right part, Moore is as convincing as they come. And in this case she stepped up to the plate with one of the best clean-up hitters of the film industry, Michael Caine.""Flawless"" is my favorite performance by Demi Moore thus far. The film begins with a young journalist meeting an older woman at a modern tavern. In less than a minute, I realized the older woman is Moore with aging makeup to make her seem much older. The older woman says she has not been a free woman until now. Her story begins as a young ambitious executive-want-to-be in the men's world of the diamond trade in 1960. An American who was Oxford-educated, Laura Quin (Moore) had been dedicated to her job at London Diamond for a decade and a half as a high-end negotiator, but had been passed up for promotion on several occasions.One crucial day, a massacre of slave labor in one of the diamond mines run by the London firm threatens to compromise their hold on the trade market. They fear the Russians, who have been in bed with the London firm as a way to control their monopoly, will back out of their trade relations as a way to show support for the laborers. Quin makes an interesting proposal: allow the contract to continue in secret and let the Soviets ""pound their fists"" toward unjust capitalism at the UN. The Firm believes its a good idea, but they also decide she knows too much and should be relieved of her position, since only people in the inner circle should be privy to such information. Quin is informed of her dismissal from Hobbs, the night janitor (Michael Caine) in a kind of clandestine meeting at a movie theatre.Later when the two meet again, the hypothesis of stealing a small amount of diamonds from the firm's vault becomes the main topic of discussion, simply for the money. Hobbs claims he needs a pension, and she'll need it because she'll be unemployed. The vault contains heaps of uncut raw diamonds which have not been measured or cut, presumably straight from the mines. If a few go missing, a thermostat's worth, none will be the wiser save Moore and Caine. Even at a million pounds each, ""They wouldn't even notice that much,"" Hobbs explains.Like most typical Heist movies, the plans are made and the execution keeps you at the edge of your seat. The two seem somewhat ill-chosen for this operation which is one of the key ingredients of heist movies. However, what happens after the heist's completion is what turns this film from a good one to a great one. A remarkable twist occurs in the middle of the film, and from then on, I had no idea where the story was leading, which in my book is where a great film has to go. And the ending is convincing and satisfying. Moore and Caine offer outstanding performances, and the film seems to get more interesting as it goes along. Apparently, this movie was a box office disappointment, which is unfortunate as it deserves much more recognition than it has achieved.",4,Best Heist Movie Since Remake of Ocean's 11: Moore is Flawless,1311811200,"07 28, 2011",2011,3768,"['Rumours', 'have', 'often', 'abounded', 'difficulties', 'people', 'show', 'business', 'have', 'working', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'ego', 'conceit', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'have', 'never', 'met', 'Moore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'aspect', 'other', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'rumours', 'are', 'well-founded', 'off-screen', 'persona', 'did', 'sometimes', 'come', 'off', 'direct', 'antithesis', 'someone', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'who', 'always', 'distanced', 'own', 'fame', 'Especially', 'when', 'was', 'married', 'Willis', 'Moore', 'appeared', 'drink', 'spotlight', 'Hollywood', 'fame', 'alcoholic', 'reaching', 'vodka', 'Now', 'star', 'dimmed', 'somewhat', 'allowed', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'simply', 'act', 'high-quality', 'entertaining', 'projects', 'main', 'reason', 'Moore', 'been', 'where', 'do', 'ability', 'actress', 'not', 'celebrity', 'right', 'part', 'Moore', 'as', 'convincing', 'come', 'case', 'stepped', 'up', 'plate', 'one', 'best', 'clean-up', 'hitters', 'film', 'industry', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Flawless', 'favorite', 'performance', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'thus', 'far', 'film', 'young', 'journalist', 'meeting', 'older', 'woman', 'modern', 'tavern', 'less', 'minute', 'realized', 'older', 'woman', 'Moore', 'aging', 'makeup', 'make', 'seem', 'much', 'older', 'older', 'woman', 'not', 'been', 'free', 'woman', 'now', 'story', 'young', 'ambitious', 'executive-want-to-be', 'men', 'world', 'diamond', 'trade', '1960', 'American', 'who', 'was', 'Oxford-educated', 'Laura', 'Quin', 'Moore', 'had', 'been', 'dedicated', 'job', 'London', 'Diamond', 'decade', 'half', 'high-end', 'negotiator', 'had', 'been', 'passed', 'up', 'promotion', 'several', 'occasions.One', 'crucial', 'day', 'massacre', 'slave', 'labor', 'one', 'diamond', 'mines', 'run', 'London', 'firm', 'compromise', 'hold', 'trade', 'market', 'fear', 'Russians', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'bed', 'London', 'firm', 'way', 'control', 'monopoly', 'will', 'back', 'trade', 'relations', 'way', 'show', 'support', 'laborers', 'Quin', 'interesting', 'proposal', 'allow', 'contract', 'continue', 'secret', 'let', 'Soviets', 'pound', 'fists', 'unjust', 'capitalism', 'UN', 'Firm', 'good', 'idea', 'also', 'decide', 'too', 'much', 'should', 'be', 'relieved', 'position', 'only', 'people', 'inner', 'circle', 'should', 'be', 'privy', 'such', 'information', 'Quin', 'informed', 'dismissal', 'Hobbs', 'night', 'janitor', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'kind', 'clandestine', 'meeting', 'movie', 'theatre.Later', 'when', 'two', 'meet', 'again', 'hypothesis', 'stealing', 'small', 'amount', 'diamonds', 'firm', 'vault', 'main', 'topic', 'discussion', 'simply', 'money', 'Hobbs', 'pension', ""'ll"", 'need', ""'ll"", 'be', 'unemployed', 'vault', 'heaps', 'uncut', 'raw', 'diamonds', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'measured', 'cut', 'presumably', 'straight', 'mines', 'few', 'go', 'missing', 'thermostat', 'worth', 'none', 'will', 'be', 'wiser', 'save', 'Moore', 'Caine', 'Even', 'million', 'pounds', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'much', 'Hobbs', 'most', 'typical', 'Heist', 'movies', 'plans', 'are', 'made', 'execution', 'edge', 'seat', 'two', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'ill-chosen', 'operation', 'one', 'key', 'ingredients', 'heist', 'movies', 'However', 'what', 'heist', 'completion', 'what', 'film', 'good', 'one', 'great', 'one', 'remarkable', 'twist', 'middle', 'film', 'then', 'had', 'idea', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'leading', 'book', 'where', 'great', 'film', 'go', 'ending', 'convincing', 'satisfying', 'Moore', 'Caine', 'offer', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'film', 'get', 'more', 'interesting', 'along', 'Apparently', 'movie', 'was', 'box', 'office', 'disappointment', 'unfortunate', 'much', 'more', 'recognition', 'achieved']",Flawless

No weak plot holes, no imperfect characterizations, no wasted or wasteful verbiage, timing or editing. Just like the stones they manage - it's been cut perfectly.Additionally, if there were ever a film that truly celebrates women WITHOUT the pathetic Hollywood clich&eacute;s that consistently find their way into so called 'empowerment' flicks - this is it. I can't recommend this enough to any woman, young or old, who won't be inspired by Moore's performance as Laura Quinn - the strong, bold and energetic professional consistently pre-judged and passed over by lesser individuals simply because she was female.A revealing peek into the inequalities and injustices that women faced in the early days of the postwar business world. One that is sadly authentic and accurate. But her response to the continual professional and personal indignities is wickedly wonderful.This is likely my favorite performance by Ms. Moore. A quiet and substantial role that should've garnered a lot more attention by the award committees. And for me personally, a major, major uptick in respect for her as a thespian.And yet another sublime role for the inimitable Michael Caine as the quiet Mr. Hobbs, janitor and general nobody. He delivers these performances with such ease that I suspect we take them, and him, for granted. Try to imagine another performer in this role - the list is exceedingly brief.Like any good heist flick, there are several excellent twists - enough for even the most jaded of fans to be kept guessing. Just what is Mr. Hobbs' end game? And what really happened at The London Diamond Exchange all those years ago?A top notch film on so many levels.

Set in 60s era England,  with an English diamond cartel masquerading as DeBeers, and it's protagonist Laura Quinn played by the well cast Demi Moore, the film  captures both the period, and the glass ceiling misery of a woman working in 'a man's world.'The atmosphere of the film is spot on, with gorgeous bank interiors, rainy London nights, and even Quinn's wood-paneled, smoke filled office. Perhaps it's strongest element, the viewer feels immersed in the secretive and foreign world of the diamond broker from the very opening scene in which an African diamond miner unearths a collection of stones, and as the viewer watches a series of vignettes, the largest of them is cut, polished, and mounted in a ring which is then shown on a newly engaged woman's finger. This provides a grounding for the action to follow, and even a subtle hint at the politics of 'conflict diamonds.'The acting is engaging and for the most part spot-on with Moore turning in an especially enjoyable performance as she teeters between supreme self confidence and despair. She is both sexy and intelligent, aptly capturing Quinn's bold ambition and masked with a carefully controlled demeanor and appearance. Michal Cane is also delightful as the night janitor who has selected Quinn as his accomplice, taking advantage of her frustration with watching men inferior to her be promoted repeatedly.The heist itself is not lavish or complex, and fails to capture the imagination until it's true nature is revealed. Unfortunately, it also strains credulity, and when all secrets are revealed, left this reviewer feeling a bit put upon. Another flaw is that the theft and it's subsequent dialogue between between Cane and Moore reveals a cheesy, moralistic and even contrived reason for the theft. This leads into the final conclusion, in which a desperate attempt to re-portray Quinn as a hero, instead turns the film on it's head as the action returns to present day England, and a conversation with a newspaper reporter interviewing Quinn. Quinn then reveals what she has done with the money, in all it's horrid, forced morality.Aside from the last fifteen minutes or so, the film is excellent if a bit slow, and fans of the caper or heist genre owe it to themselves to watch it.

When dedicated, brilliant Laura is once again passed over for promotion by her chauvanistic employers, crooked handyman Mr. Hobbs (Michael Caine) inducts her into his plan to steal millions of pounds worth of uncut diamonds from the seemingly-impregnable company.With achingly beautiful, tense direction supplied by the highly talented Michael Radford (""The Merchant of Venice"", ""1984""), ""Flawless"" is more than a worthwhile thriller/heist movie: it's a brilliant showcase of Moore's talents as a serious actress, and the chemistry between Laura and the enigmatic Mr. Hobbs (Michael Caine, himself on fine form) is palpable and rewarding. A solid supporting cast is made stronger by the presences of Joss Ackland as Laura's intractable C.E.O., and Simon Day as sympathetic detective Boland, both men underpinning the very strong performances given by Moore and Caine, and not allowing ""Flawless"" to become a mere Star Vehicle for either one. But if Caine is great (and, as usual, he's really great), then Moore is truly outstanding: her flinty, cool reading of Laura Quinn is perfectly pitched, and here's hoping that Moore will be cast in more movies of this caliber from now on.The 1960s backdrop, with its technological redundancies, could have, in the hands of a lesser director, become a kind of whimsical playground, but it's a testament to Radford's skill that the tension in ""Flawless"" never lets up: sure, the televisions, safes and security cameras look sixty years old, but thanks to Radford's camerawork, every scene in ""Flawless"" sparkles with its own dramatic, dynamic brilliance.My only issue with ""Flawless"" is the frankly stupid opening-and-closing scenes: Demi Moore in a rubber Old Lady Mask throwing a redundant Women's Lib motto in the audience's collective face. The entire premise of ""Flawless"" is founded on the idea of women taking charge of their own independence, and while in the 1960s timeline this works beautifully, the contemporary scenes of Laura retelling her tale to an irritating young journalist are very jarring - in terms of directorial skill and acting quality, they don't measure up to the main bulk of the picture.Still, that notwithstanding, ""Flawless"" is overall an excellent movie: highly entertaining, it's a sleek and polished blockbuster with excellent central performances and some brilliant direction.

1152156,A387BD735MI50R,B001662FIW,R. Schultz,"[2, 3]","There's nothing really wrong with this film - it just seems to fall sort of flat. There isn't the chemistry there should be between Michael Caine and Demi Moore. And their diamond heist plan is only allowed to move forward by virtue of a couple of highly improbable strokes of good luck - such as having a pair of binoculars fall into Moore's hands at just the right moment.There is also something a little disturbingly harsh and unconvincing about the lighting and make-up work on this film. The stars look prematurely aged at the start of the movie. Then as the scene arcs to Demi Moore as an old woman, she looks even more unconvincing as a senior. Early movies used to do a notoriously bad job of making young people look old. Perhaps it wasn't the fault of the make-up artists. It might be even more difficult to make a young person look old than it is to make an old person look young. In the last decade or so though, the art of make-up and prosthetic devices seemed to grow equal to the task. But now ""Flawless"" set the art back again with Moore's obviously adventitious wrinkles.While this is primarily a caper film, a strong secondary theme is ""You've come a long way, baby!"" This movie is effective at showing how precarious Demi Moore's position was in the 1960's when she was the only female executive in a diamond brokerage firm. She has to walk a thin line between coming up with a stream of innovative, profit-making ideas for the firm - and conforming to corporate culture and consensus. Whichever side of that line she falls on, she is always in danger of being undermined by her male co-workers who assume priority when it comes to corporate advancement.However, I'm not sure the movie makes its case for how much better things are nowadays when it shows modern executive women being powerful simply by virtue of having frequently ringing cell phones and having cultivated a bustling, confident stride.This DVD unfortunately has no full-length Director's commentary, only fragmentary ""Making Of"" commentaries. I would have liked an accompanying voice-over that explained a number of the confusing plot points and filled in what I thought were some missing links in the plot.There were also no English subtitles for this film. Again, I missed those, especially in the early part of the film when Caine and Moore speak in such rapid sotto vocce that I had trouble catching everything they said.All in all, this movie has some merit, but it's sufficient to rent it.

It is a bit slow at times, but it builds to a very satisfying ending.  This film is as much about sexism in the workplace as it is a caper film.  This film is as much about the respect, or lack thereof, given to people based upon their job position and/or length of service to a company, as it is a crime story.  This film is as much a moral tale as it is about an immoral act, stealing.The cast is first-rate with Demi Moore, picture perfect as an early 1960's Londoner trapped in a position in which she is overqualified and passed over for positions in which she is qualified.  She is sexy as ever, but much more understated here.  Michael Caine is, as usual, a total class act and very believable as the long-suffering janitor who spies a chance to get what he thinks he deserves.Now, the plot is not very complicated, but it does have its twists and turns, as any good heist film will have.  It's not as smart as it thinks it is, but it isn't dumb either.  This is a nice divergence from the more loud heist films we are used to getting from Hollywood.

As a product of the 50's and 60's, she is struggling against the testosterone glass of a corporate ceiling in a London diamond firm that controls the entire world's supply of diamonds;  dominated by men she can never hope to unhorse, no matter how much better she might be at the same job, simply because she is a woman.  She has almost accepted this, writes ""goal notes"" to herself in order to keep focused, but she always believes she will prevail because she ""works hard"" and ""must work harder"".  Her defining moment comes when she speaks out during a management meeting that she is barely eligible to attend, with a plan that gives all of ""the smartest men in the room"" pause and learns later that they used her innovative idea to distinct advantage, and in return are not only are planning to fire her to protect the ceiling, but have sabotaged her to another firm that would have hired her - of course, because that would not be good for business if she took her brains elsewhere.  Being a ""Dog in a Manger"" so to speak, is far preferable to a loose dog with not only the smarts but the education to insure a competitor's success .  Since the competitor is laboring under the same ceiling and philosophy as they all are, it's easy to pull it off.  She's ""out""-  but doesn't know it yet.Enter the janitor (Michael Caine) who has been waiting years for such a  moment and for such a motivated person.  (""patience is a virtue"") The janitor whom everyone speaks plainly over the  head of as he goes about his work, because of course, he doesn't have the wits to comprehend what they might be revealing.  And it's not about money.  How he does it and how he doesn't, is a plot extraordinaire.But as an afterthought:  have you, as a film viewer of heists, murders, robberies, etc., sprinkled occasionally, or liberally with clandestine infidelities and other top secret events, ever wondered WHY people obviously smart enough to come up with a blow-your-mind plot always choose to discuss their nefarious plans in a place crawling with potential eavesdroppers?  Do they leap into a car and take a private drive together, slip into a lonely corner of a park, or some other place devoid of security cameras or nosy neighbors to discuss the caper?  No.  They head to the busiest restaurant, movie theatre or pub that they can find and go over the details where anyone with a sharp ear might hear the whole thing.I enjoyed the movie even though Cane's heavy British accent kept me intensely alert all of the time, ear cocked and straining;  and not just because of the plot.",4,"""Hell hath no gentle fury.........""",1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,2724,"['Janitor', 'agenda', 'Demi', 'Moore', 'part', 'brilliant', 'woman', 'executive', 'who', 'had', 'misfortune', 'be', 'born', '40', 'years', 'too', 'late', 'product', '50', '60', 'struggling', 'testosterone', 'glass', 'corporate', 'ceiling', 'London', 'diamond', 'firm', 'entire', 'world', 'supply', 'diamonds', 'dominated', 'men', 'can', 'never', 'hope', 'unhorse', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'might', 'be', 'same', 'job', 'simply', 'woman', 'almost', 'accepted', 'goal', 'notes', 'herself', 'order', 'keep', 'focused', 'always', 'will', 'prevail', 'hard', 'must', 'work', 'harder', 'defining', 'moment', 'when', 'out', 'management', 'meeting', 'barely', 'eligible', 'attend', 'plan', 'smartest', 'men', 'room', 'pause', 'later', 'used', 'innovative', 'idea', 'distinct', 'advantage', 'return', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'planning', 'fire', 'protect', 'ceiling', 'have', 'sabotaged', 'firm', 'would', 'have', 'hired', 'course', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'good', 'business', 'took', 'brains', 'elsewhere', 'Being', 'Dog', 'Manger', 'so', 'speak', 'far', 'preferable', 'loose', 'dog', 'not', 'only', 'smarts', 'education', 'insure', 'competitor', 'success', 'competitor', 'laboring', 'same', 'ceiling', 'philosophy', 'are', 'easy', 'pull', 'off', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet.Enter', 'janitor', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'who', 'been', 'waiting', 'years', 'moment', 'such', 'motivated', 'person', 'patience', 'virtue', 'janitor', 'whom', 'everyone', 'plainly', 'head', 'work', 'course', ""n't"", 'have', 'wits', 'comprehend', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'revealing', 'not', 'money', 'How', 'how', ""n't"", 'plot', 'extraordinaire.But', 'afterthought', 'have', 'film', 'viewer', 'heists', 'murders', 'robberies', 'etc.', 'sprinkled', 'occasionally', 'liberally', 'clandestine', 'infidelities', 'other', 'top', 'secret', 'events', 'ever', 'wondered', 'WHY', 'people', 'obviously', 'smart', 'enough', 'come', 'up', 'blow-your-mind', 'plot', 'always', 'choose', 'discuss', 'nefarious', 'plans', 'place', 'crawling', 'potential', 'eavesdroppers', 'Do', 'leap', 'car', 'take', 'private', 'drive', 'together', 'slip', 'lonely', 'corner', 'park', 'other', 'place', 'devoid', 'security', 'cameras', 'nosy', 'neighbors', 'discuss', 'caper', 'No', 'head', 'busiest', 'restaurant', 'movie', 'theatre', 'pub', 'can', 'find', 'go', 'details', 'where', 'anyone', 'sharp', 'ear', 'might', 'hear', 'whole', 'thing.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'even', 'Cane', 'heavy', 'British', 'accent', 'kept', 'intensely', 'alert', 'time', 'ear', 'cocked', 'straining', 'not', 'just', 'plot']",Flawless

She is a Vice President with the world's largest diamond wholesaler, based in London. She watches in frustration as all of her male co-workers are promoted around her, leaving her with the same responsibilities, the same office, the same schedule. She comes in early every day and leaves last every night, yet her boss Sir Milton Ashtoncroft (Joss Ackland) doesn't seem to notice. Ashtoncroft is a shady character at best, but Quinn realizes she will never be able to get a comparable job anywhere else. Mr. Hobbs (Michael Caine), one of the many janitors, has worked for the same company for years. In his nightly rounds, he has made observations and approaches Ms. Quinn with an idea. He could, with her assistance, steal a small handful of diamonds from the company vault, enough to set them each up for a long time. They could each escape the lives they are trapped in. Quinn is dubious but Mr. Hobbs shows her how he would do it, and she is on board. But it looks like Mr. Hobbs has other ideas and other motives.""Flawless"", directed by Michael Radford (""Il Postino"") is an interesting, overlooked film. At it's heart, ""Flawless"" is a caper film ""based on a true story"", but it presents so many other ideas and themes, making it more complex and watch able.Michael Caine is, as always, great. Mr. Hobbs is the kindly old man you see hobbling along, happy with his place in life, always eager and willing to do his job. But as we learn more and more about him, we see there are many other levels to his character. Caine is a great actor, a subtle actor and he reveals these layers slowly making them more believable and surprising. It isn't Caine's best performance ever, but Mr. Hobbs is immensely watch able.Demi Moore is also good as Laura Quinn, an American woman working for an international firm in London in 1960. She realizes how hard she has to work to maintain this position, so she comes to work early and leaves late, always checking in with security as she does so. But what does this get her? A lot of lonely nights at her flat, eating dinner alone. As the story progresses, we see Quinn's aggravation with her situation, but because she has to still maintain her persona, she can't become too emotional or upset. This becomes an asset to their plan.And when the diamonds are stolen, the company calls in an investigator, Finch (Lambert Wilson). Perhaps the best thing about ""Flawless"" is that everyone is pretty smart; Mr. Hobbs comes up with the plan, Quinn contributes certain qualities and Finch begins to suspect certain people as he tries to figure out how the robbery was accomplished.Michael Radford, who gained a lot of attention with ""Il Postino"", has struggled since, releasing a series of films that were either critically maligned, quickly forgotten by the public, or both. Unfortunately, ""Flawless"" won't change his fortunes, but it is a good film.As the story and the heist proceed, he uses the canvas as a way to introduce many other themes, helping to establish the time and setting for the film. The company Quinn and Hobbs work for is a huge diamond collective based in Botswana. In addition to the heist, the company officers have to handle the press who are circling because of the daily protests about the company's involvement with blood diamonds. Laura Quinn recognizes she is a rarity; a female executive at a large corporation in London, and an American woman at that. So this causes her to be a bit tentative and reluctant to join Hobbs plan. Instead, she would rather continue trying to work hard; continue trying to beat at the glass ceiling. As the story unfolds, and she begins to realize how her male co-workers treat her, she knows she will never rise above her current situation.The story takes some unexpected turns because Hobbs and Quinn aren't honest with one another. And this provides a mild level of excitement. When we finally learn the motive behind the robbery, another theme is introduced.If this film is, as stated, ""based on a true story"", it is a story that far ahead of its time. It is for this reason that I have to wonder how much of this story is based on real events. I suspect not much.

Roberts ""Film Historian""","[2, 5]","The heist thriller ""Flawless"" concerns not so much the planning and execution of a master crime as it does the scandalous hysteria that erupts in the wake of the theft of one-hundred million pounds worth of diamonds.  ""Il Postino"" director Michael Radford and scenarist Edward Anderson have contrived a cold, antiseptic, humor-free, 1960's period-piece thriller that is polished, pretty to look at, but ostensibly pallid.  No, ""Flawless"" is neither ""Rififi"" (1954) nor ""Topkapi"" (1964).  ""Flawless"" won't make your palms perspire in dreadful anticipation.  This is a heist movie where the organization is so corrupt itself that we don't care if they get taken to the cleaners and if some of their leaders take a fatal plunge.  The diamond company here acquires its stones under shady circumstances that the movie ""Blood Diamond"" explored with greater depth and melodrama.The two protagonists, Demi Moore and Michael Caine, are dish rag dull.  We sympathize about their respective plights.  He has a grief-stricken history involving a wife who died from cancer fifteen years ago owing to hospital insurance complications, and she is an 18-year executive at the Diamond company whose gender works against her in a man's world.  The two have struggled their entire lives against an unfair system.  Women will lament the sexual discrimination with which the heroine contends, and the casting of Demi Moore is apt, since she starred in the Michael Douglas movie ""Disclosure"" about reverse sexual discrimination in the workplace.  Michael Caine isn't capable of giving a bad performance.  Indeed, his lowly, blue collar, Al Capp custodian is probably the only thing flawless about ""Flawless.""  Attention-deficient audiences will tire of this painstaking exercise in larceny.""Flawless"" opens appropriately enough with African-American hands dredging up uncut diamonds from mother earth, and Radford traces the passage that the stones make from anonymity to radiate gems set in a ring on a woman's hand.  Indeed, it's a nice way to open a film, but ""Flawless"" is rather tame as heist thrillers go, and the scrupulous attention to detail that distinguishes this tale becomes tiresome.  The plot shifts gears from this opening to a present day sequence in London with an elderly Laura Quinn (Demi Moore of ""G.I. Jane"") sitting down for an interview about being a role model business woman.  The moment that she says she hasn't been in London for 40 years is a red herring to make us think that something else happened.  Unfortunately, this misdirection yields little in the way of anxiety.  Radford transport us back to the 1960s and we see the stuffed shirts that Quinn works with as the only female executive at the London Diamonds Corporation.  A smart, successful, Oxford-educated American she is butting her well-coiffed head against a glass ceiling.  She strikes up an unlikely acquaintance with Mr. Hobbs (Michael Caine of ""The Italian Job"") who sees all and knows all as a custodian.  People speak freely around him because they discount him as a nobody.  Hobbs warns Quinn at one point that she is about to be sacked and she confirms his information in a delightful little sequence.Hobbs engineers a scheme to steal diamonds.  An amusing sequence takes place early in the action when he invites Quinn to a cinema to discuss the plan during a showing of the classic crime caper ""The League of Gentlemen"" (1960) with Jack Hawkins and Richard Attenborough.  This movie effectively establishes a time reference.  Meanwhile, the Corporation installs security surveillance cameras that cycle in 60 second blocks to keep track of all corridors including the one in front of a huge vault door.  This obstacle presents a challenge that keeps Hobbs on his toes, but overall it works to the detriment of the firm.  The flaw is that when the Hobbs character effects entry into the vault, the security guard is so preoccupied with his culinary distractions that he takes his eyes off the security monitors far too long.  Meanwhile, Quinn has to scramble from one phone booth to another to make a call that will continue to distract the guard.  It seems that in her haste to make the first call, she overlooked the fact that the phone cord had been cut!  In the long run, her contribution is disposable.  The suspense that Radford generates is mild.  Again, it isn't the technology that thwarts the crime as much as the foibles of human nature.  Hobbs cleans the place out and the bosses are shocked when they discover their entire inventory has vanished.Later, after the crime has occurred and a well-dressed investigator, Finch (Lambert Wilson), has been summoned to investigate it, Radford tries to build tension between an anxious Quinn and an obdurate Hobbs.  Hobbs refuses to give in.  Cigarette puffing Quinn hangs on tenterhooks and fears the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence.  Indeed, one breathless moment takes place after the robbery, but unless you are on your toes, you may overlook it.  Eventually, in the post-mortem of the crime that Radford presents during the final quarter, we learn how Hobbs disposed of all that ice without lugging it out the door.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers must have gambled that their reticence about the whereabouts of the missing stones would tantalize us.  It doesn't.  Meanwhile, we watch without worry as Quinn runs amok with mild-mannered hysteria trying to find the stones.  Hobbs keeps his head in this crisis and comes off as the harmless, old duffer that he pretends, right down to his limp.  No, he isn't like the villain of ""The Usual Suspects"" who was a chameleon.  The other revelation about what our heroine has been doing for the last forty years is bittersweet.  ""Flawless"" refuses to let you have your cake and enjoy it, too.  In other words, it isn't a lot of fun.",2,"""Flawless"" Has More Than Its Share of Flaws",1227830400,"11 28, 2008",2008,5819,"['heist', 'thriller', 'Flawless', 'concerns', 'not', 'so', 'much',

1152167,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001662FIW,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","""Flawless"" is a well-cast 'heist' movie with a difference - it relies on wit rather than slick action and the leads do a credible job in engaging viewers.Demi Moore plays an executive at a London-based diamond firm, Lon Di, though despite being smart and resilient, she finds herself unable to crack the glass ceiling, being passed over repeatedly in favor of guys less experienced and able. Michael Caine plays a janitor at the same firm who comes up with a plan to steal from the company but needs help. The disgruntled female executive and ambitious janitor team up for an unusual heist. Though Demi Moore's character plays a minimal role in the actual heist, she finds herself astounded when she realises that not only has the janitor managed to pull it off - he has done an amazing feat - the entire diamond collection in the vault disappears! The rest of the story deals with the investigation, how both leads try to escape detection, and explores the real motives behind the heist.Not everything appears to be what it is and this makes ""Flawless"" compelling to watch - Michael Caine is amazing in his role as the soft-spoken but fiercely-determined janitor who seems to harbor some secrets of his own. Demi Moore's character is less complex yet she portrays the 60's era ambitious female exec to the hilt, and her frustrations at being unable to break the gender barrier and get promoted is convincingly portrayed.The plot unfolds slowly but surely and the story is one that engages and makes for a compelling watch.
