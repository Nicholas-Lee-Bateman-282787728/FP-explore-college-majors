It is like a teen soap opera with all the love and sorrow, danger and intrigue.  Thank you for finally bringing this dvd to America.  I had never seen season 1...what a joy!  I already preordered season 1.5.

1516474,A3ADNUE73Q7AUB,B006JN87DE,just my opinion,"[1, 8]",Since the adults are all dead (except for some minor flashbacks) this leaves the whole series populated with kids.  It could have been interesting if it had been written for an adult audience --- but it seems aimed at tweens and teens.Basically - BORINGGGGGGGGGGGGG.Not worth buying unless you absolutely have to have it for your collection.,1,Gangbangers with cool accent and bad makeup,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,341,"['adults', 'are', 'dead', 'minor', 'flashbacks', 'whole', 'series', 'populated', 'kids', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'adult', 'audience', 'aimed', 'tweens', 'teens.Basically', 'BORINGGGGGGGGGGGGG.Not', 'buying', 'absolutely', 'have', 'have', 'collection']","The Tribe: Series 1, Part 1"

I even had facepaint at my wedding inspired by The Tribe. The acting is at times a little if-y, but the characters and plots and setting keep you going, you really get involved with the plot turns and relationships. LOVE the outfits and styles, they helped inspire some of my best looks. Definatly a wonderful childhood memory that I still watch as an adult. I cant WAIT for this to finally be released so us U.S. and Canadian fans can own it! Wish the entire series was coming out all at once, I would so buy that on day one!I have season 1 in Region 2 format, but its hard cuz i can only watch it on my computer and sometimes it still doesnt read the discs right. Cant wait to pop these in to watch on my tv!
