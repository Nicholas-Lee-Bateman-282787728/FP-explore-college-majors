M Sullivan,"[15, 18]","The low budget mediocre acting is somewhat forgivable, but I can't look past the over the top plot and emotional psychosis of the main character. What should have been a quirky romantic comedy turned into an incestuous love fest where everyone is sleeping with everyone else. Not only is it a cliche and tired plot, but far from anything remotely realistic. Furthermore the main character is painful to even watch as she traipses through life being ""easy"" as it were because she's an emotional vampire. In the end we question whether she can be happy with any of the characters, much less the man she ends up with, because she can't ever be happy on her own.None of these characters are exactly role models nor do any of them actually make for an interesting movie.

876482,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,B00070Q82M,Cowboy Buddha,"[49, 57]","I generally enjoy quirky little independent films about modern relationships, but Easy is an exception. It seems to have been marketed as a romantic comedy and, to be fair, there a few nicely comic moments along the way. Unfortunately, the amusing bits would not make up an episode of a tv sitcom. Most of the film is a fairly predictable soap opera with moderately explicit sex scenes which seem to suggest that woman on top is the new missionary position.The leading character is pleasant enough. Her offbeat nature is underlined by her ridiculous job - the sort that only people in movies have. The composition of the rest of the cast screams political correctness and everyone seems to love everybody else regardless of race, creed, or lack of attractiveness. The problem is that I found it difficult to care about any of them. The rather forced emotions of the script made involvement with them impossible. By the time the happy ending is reached, I found myself thinking: ""You could have done that an hour ago."" Possibly, some of the problem is mine - I suspect I am not part of the film's target audience. Even so, Easy is nothing special and offers nothing new.

After spending years as a ""jerk magnet"", she is about to quit the dating scene when lo and behold, two decent guys with real potential come along. Like they say, ""it never rains but it pours"". She is then faced with the opposite problem of deciding which guy would be the better choice. While watching it, I didn't really know how things would turn out because both guys she was into were actually quite likeable. Fortunately everything ends happily. Well it is a romantic comedy. :)I thought customers might want to know the specs for this DVD seeing as Amazon has continued its bad habit of omitting tech specs from newer releases. The DVD is by Screen Media Films. It is in it's original aspect ratio of 1.85.1 (enhanced for widescreen TV). Colors are accurate. There is quite a bit of film grain but not too distracting. My only quibble with the presentation is that black levels are closer to a dull grey so that the transfer lacks a sense of depth and richness. Soundwise it's in 2.0 and 5.1 surround with pretty decent sound reproduction. There are no close captions or subtitles contrary to what it says on the backcover and on Amazon.All in all a very enjoyable movie. Definitely worth a viewing.",4,Love is never Easy...

All of the supporting cast were great, especially John and Mick. However, the main character absolutely stole the show and really draws the audience in to feel her happiness and pain.I am sure that everyone has seen plenty of movies, in their time, that attempt to depict relationships in today's world, and they all fall woefully short of the truth. Most movies attempt to show as much nudity as possible and hold back the emotion; while this movie has some nudity, it is effectively done with Moreau being in the moment, either showing her affection or love for the character she is with. Easy was able to pull off ""classy"" nudity on camera, however ""classy"" nudity may be able to be. I did not feel at any point that it was overdone, nor was the acting overdone.Moreau feels like a friend that everybody has and everybody knows that just wants to be happy, but is confused as to how to arrive at that happiness.
