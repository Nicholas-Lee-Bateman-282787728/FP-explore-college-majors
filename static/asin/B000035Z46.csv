516687,AMICVV9N2U2R4,B000035Z46,Atli Hafsteinsson,"[1, 1]","An Extremely Goofy Movie is a direct-to-video sequel, and it shows. Goofy and his son Max star in another movie about the two coming to terms with each other despite their differences. Therein lies the movie's weakness. A Goofy Movie had already done this. Was there really need for the same scenario to unfold; Max being embarrassed by his dad and learning to accept him? Goofy learning to let go and realize Max was an adult? An Extremely Goofy Movie is about both these things, and not as strongly developed.Max is now going off to college with his friends PJ and Bobby. Max is intensely relieved to be rid of his dad, and looks forward to the three of them winning the College X-Games (involving rollerskating, bicycling and skateboarding among other things). Goofy is on the complete other shoe, depressed about Max moving away from home. This melancholy inadvertently causes him to lose his job at the factory. Realizing that he can only get another job by earning a college degree, Goofy enrolls in Max's college, to his horror. Cue Goofy's lack of parental distance. Things get worse when Goofy ends up being selected to join the Gammas, the X-Games champions and Max's arch-rivals.I found myself very annoyed at both Max and Goofy during this film. Whereas in A Goofy Movie, you both understood and were frustrated by the pair of them, here they both were just bang out of order on so many occasions. Goofy goes beyond just being overly upset about letting Max go off to live his life; he barges into Max's dorm room, takes seats next to his son when Max is inviting a girl to sit there, the list goes on and on. Max is just as frustrating. Here, he is about 50% less mature than he was in A Goofy Movie; snotty and braggy, and very much mean to his father on many occasions. Pride comes before you take a fall, Max. Why, exactly, is winning the X-Games so important to him, anyway? Way more important than college itself, apparently. He's hardly a likeable character at all in this film, which is a bad thing. Annoying as he is as well, I usually found myself on Goofy's side.Furthermore, where is Roxanne? The movie makes no acknowledgement that she even exists, and this after everything Max went through in A Goofy Movie to impress her. Also, Bradley Uppercrust the Third and his posse the Gammas get away with just too many things in the movie. No marginally organized sporting event would let what they do go by unnoticed; they even pull off many tricks with crowds of people around them!Having said all of that, I still enjoy An Extremely Goofy Movie. Goofy is a riot as ever, especially when he gets into that 70s groove of his (being when he last was at college). Him dealing with his son having grown up and going to college really touches a chord with me, being at college myself. Goofy's romance with the ungainly college librarian, Sylvia, is wonderful; we don't often get to see Goofy in love, and he and Sylvia make a cute couple. We have other great supporting characters such as Tank, Bradley's muscle and the two duelling X-game reporters.Finally, the movie LOOKS great! The character animation is all first class, especially for a direct-to-video Disney sequel. Take Return of Jafar and compare the animation in that with An Extremely Goofy Movie; like night and day. The music is alright, and has a distinct 70s flair whenever Goofy is in that mode. It's just a shame that there are no real musical numbers; none of the characters sing in this movie.Overall, An Extremely Goofy Movie is an entertaining, heartwarming watch. It has its shortcomings to match, though, and in the end, it only ends up as average, beautiful in terms of character animation but ugly in terms of story and character development. See it if you must, but don't expect it to hold up on repeat viewings.",3,"Good for what it is, killed by the bad story",1316908800,"09 25, 2011",2011,3805,"['Extremely', 'Goofy', 'Movie', 'direct-to-video', 'sequel', 'Goofy', 'son', 'Max', 'star', 'movie', 'two', 'coming', 'terms', 'other', 'differences', 'Therein', 'movie', 'weakness', 'Goofy', 'Movie', 'had', 'already', 'done', 'Was', 'really', 'need', 'same', 'scenario', 'unfold', 'Max', 'being', 'embarrassed', 'dad', 'learning', 'accept', 'Goofy', 'learning', 'let', 'go', 'realize', 'Max', 'was', 'adult', 'Extremely', 'Goofy', 'Movie', 'things', 'not', 'strongly', 'now', 'going', 'off', 'college', 'friends', 'PJ', 'Bobby', 'Max', 'intensely', 'relieved', 'be', 'rid', 'dad', 'forward', 'three', 'winning', 'College', 'X-Games', 'involving', 'rollerskating', 'bicycling', 'skateboarding', 'other', 'things', 'Goofy', 'complete', 'other', 'shoe', 'depressed', 'Max', 'moving', 'away', 'home', 'melancholy', 'inadvertently', 'lose', 'job', 'factory', 'Realizing', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'job', 'earning', 'college', 'degree', 'Goofy', 'Max', 'college', 'horror', 'Cue', 'Goofy', 'lack', 'parental', 'distance', 'Things', 'get', 'worse', 'when', 'Goofy', 'up', 'being', 'selected', 'join', 'Gammas', 'X-Games', 'champions', 'Max', 'arch-rivals.I', 'found', 'very', 'annoyed', 'Max', 'Goofy', 'film', 'Whereas', 'A', 'Goofy', 'Movie', 'understood', 'were', 'frustrated', 'pair', 'here', 'were', 'just', 'bang', 'out', 'order', 'so', 'many', 'occasions', 'Goofy', 'just', 'being', 'overly', 'upset', 'letting', 'Max', 'go', 'off', 'live', 'life', 'Max', 'dorm', 'room', 'seats', 'son', 'when', 'Max', 'inviting', 'girl', 'sit', 'there', 'list', 'Max', 'just', 'frustrating', 'Here', 'about', '50', '%', 'less', 'mature', 'was', 'A', 'Goofy', 'Movie', 'snotty', 'braggy', 'very', 'much', 'mean', 'father', 'many', 'occasions', 'Pride', 'take', 'fall', 'Max', 'Why', 'exactly', 'winning', 'X-Games', 'so', 'important', 'anyway', 'Way', 'more', 'important', 'college', 'apparently', 'hardly', 'likeable', 'character', 'film', 'bad', 'thing', 'Annoying', 'as', 'well', 'usually', 'found', 'Goofy', 'side.Furthermore', 'where', 'Roxanne', 'movie', 'acknowledgement', 'even', 'everything', 'Max', 'went', 'A', 'Goofy', 'Movie', 'impress', 'Also', 'Bradley', 'Uppercrust', 'Third', 'posse', 'Gammas', 'get', 'away', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'movie', 'marginally', 'organized', 'sporting', 'event', 'would', 'let', 'what', 'do', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'even', 'pull', 'off', 'many', 'tricks', 'crowds', 'people', 'Having', 'said', 'still', 'enjoy', 'Extremely', 'Goofy', 'Movie', 'Goofy', 'riot', 'ever', 'especially', 'when', '70s', 'groove', 'being', 'when', 'last', 'was', 'college', 'dealing', 'son', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'going', 'college', 'really', 'chord', 'being', 'college', 'Goofy', 'romance', 'ungainly', 'college', 'librarian', 'Sylvia', 'wonderful', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'get', 'see', 'Goofy', 'love', 'Sylvia', 'make', 'cute', 'couple', 'have', 'other', 'great', 'supporting', 'characters', 'such', 'Tank', 'Bradley', 'muscle', 'two', 'duelling', 'X-game', 'reporters.Finally', 'movie', 'LOOKS', 'great', 'character', 'animation', 'first', 'class', 'especially', 'direct-to-video', 'Disney', 'sequel', 'Take', 'Return', 'Jafar', 'compare', 'animation', 'Extremely', 'Goofy', 'Movie', 'night', 'day', 'music', 'alright', 'distinct', '70s', 'flair', 'whenever', 'Goofy', 'mode', 'just', 'shame', 'are', 'real', 'musical', 'numbers', 'none', 'characters', 'sing', 'movie.Overall', 'Extremely', 'Goofy', 'Movie', 'entertaining', 'heartwarming', 'watch', 'shortcomings', 'match', 'end', 'only', 'up', 'as', 'average', 'beautiful', 'terms', 'character', 'animation', 'ugly', 'terms', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'See', 'must', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'hold', 'up', 'repeat', 'viewings']",An Extremely Goofy Movie Disney's  VHS

Some of their sequels are remotely good; others are, well, crud.  This one fits into the &quot;good&quot; catagory, especially if you like &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;.  This has the same sort of theme as the former, but presents it in a fresh, new way, unlike some Disney sequels with reused and borrowed plots.  Basiclly, this is an outline of the plot: When Max goes off to collage, Goofy gets fired from his job because he's thinking about him instead of doing the work.  When he applies for a new one elsewhere, he finds out that they won't grant him one because he doesn't have a full collage dagree.  Any Goofy fan can figure out what happens next--Goofy goes to collage.  THE SAME COLLAGE THAT MAX IS ATTENDING.  From there, it just gets funnier and funnier as Goofy falls in love with the librarian (yes, believe it but don't ask), and more.  The nice thing is that this movie is a worthy follow-up to the first, not just some old thing they make in an hour and throw out on the market in a fancy case so they can make some $$.  While not perfect, neither was &quot;Goofy Movie&quot;, and this follows it rather nicely.  It embodies the same youthful spirit that Goofy has always had, and will please the fans.

What we found was that this one has very little panache! ALL the songs in the original were well written, catchy songs that You found yourself humming and singing to yourself all day long. This one...BLAH!! Hardly any tunes at all, and the ones there are not that great at all.The story is cute, and lives up to the original...but all round it is not even close in my books.

516706,AID8OJP77VK6Y,B000035Z46,unicornelia,"[0, 0]","From the great Disney cartoon classic shorts to the modern cartoons, characters like Goofy have been loved by all. Other characters have moved in directions like Goofy's ""Goof Troop"" with Max; Chip & Dale became ""Rescue Rangers"" and met up with Monterey Jack, Gadget, etc.; Pooh created great new movies and the cherished New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. These modernized cartoons have preserved the charm of the original cartoon shorts. ""A Goofy Movie"" was wonderful--the music was well-written, the story was entertaining, sincere, and humorous, the animation was colorful and attractive. ""An Extremely Goofy Movie"" continues the story of modern-day father Goofy and his relationship with his son, Max. Goofy's still as goofy as he was in his original cartoons, and Max would seem to be have been inspired by the young son given to Goofy in some of the short cartoons. This sequel to the Goofy Movie is excellent like the first one. The beginning focuses on Max's departure to college, which is touching. The college itself is fun to watch as it has a very diverse campus. Roxanne, my favorite character in the original, is not featured in this movie, which initially seems a disappointment or discontinuity. However, when one considers that high school crushes are usually not lasting things, and the reality that Roxanne would have been more likely to attend a different school...it seems that for once Disney did move in a more 'real life' direction rather than a 'cute' one, where the two of them would've still been together. I still would have liked to see her again, or hear her name mentioned, or see the graduation ceremony. One can only hope that she moved on to success and happiness; she seems like the type who will. But this movie goes straight into Max's college career and does it well. It DOES lack great music, but the tunes somehow manage to go without being terribly missed. Goofy, in fact, ends up requiring a degree and, of course, much to his son's chagrin, joining him for his first year of college. The overarching plotline of this movie follows Max, PJ, and Bobby's (yes, they all DID go to the same college) ambitious X Games endeavor to unseat Bradley Uppercrust III (one of the few characters I've found who's not only meant to be dislikable but actually is) and his Gammas as the skateboarding kings of the campus. Of course, this intertwines with the theme of father/son bonding and how Goofy wants Max to see that focusing on his goals is the only way to achieve success in his future. To me, the more interesting parts of the movie occur when Goofy falls in love with Sylvia Marpole, the librarian who shares his passion for 70's memorabilia and disco, and when PJ hooks up with the 'beret girl' who hangs out at the Bean Scene Cafe.Goofy falling in love sounds like it would be cliche, predictable, and corny/cheesy, right? Actually, it's not...it's nicely done. Sylvia is quite compatible with him and an interesting, well-developed character (especially for only being introduced in this one film). The same goes for the smart, poetic Beret Girl who sees something in PJ that other girls don't, and becomes his girlfriend. Character design and development in this (and actually, both Goofy Movies) is quite good. Sylvia and Beret (would be nice to call her by a name, but somehow it seems fitting with her that we're not allowed to know her name...hmmm!) reminded me vaguely of Chel from 'The Road to El Dorado.' I am much more impressed with this movie, however.From the great cartoon classics to the modern Goofy Movies that have evolved, it's clear that he's one of those characters who always turns out wonderful animation and never disappoints.",5,"Fun, fun, fun.",1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,3689,"['great', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'classic', 'shorts', 'modern', 'cartoons', 'characters', 'Goofy', 'have', 'been', 'loved', 'Other', 'characters', 'have', 'moved', 'directions', 'Goofy', 'Goof', 'Troop', 'Max', 'Chip', 'Dale', 'became', 'Rescue', 'Rangers', 'met', 'up', 'Monterey', 'Jack', 'Gadget', 'etc', 'Pooh', 'created', 'great', 'new', 'movies', 'cherished', 'New', 'Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'modernized', 'cartoons', 'have', 'preserved', 'charm', 'original', 'cartoon', 'shorts', 'Goofy', 'Movie', 'was', 'wonderful', 'music', 'was', 'well-written', 'story', 'was', 'entertaining', 'sincere', 'humorous', 'animation', 'was', 'colorful', 'attractive', 'Extremely', 'Goofy', 'Movie', 'story', 'modern-day', 'father', 'Goofy', 'relationship', 'son', 'Max', 'Goofy', 'still', 'as', 'goofy', 'was', 'original', 'cartoons', 'Max', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'young', 'son', 'given', 'Goofy', 'short', 'cartoons', 'sequel', 'Goofy', 'Movie', 'excellent', 'first', 'one', 'beginning', 'Max', 'departure', 'college', 'touching', 'college', 'fun', 'watch', 'very', 'diverse', 'campus', 'Roxanne', 'favorite', 'character', 'original', 'not', 'featured', 'movie', 'initially', 'disappointment', 'discontinuity', 'However', 'when', 'one', 'high', 'school', 'crushes', 'are', 'usually', 'not', 'lasting', 'things', 'reality', 'Roxanne', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'likely', 'attend', 'different', 'school', 'once', 'Disney', 'did', 'move', 'more', ""'real"", 'life', 'direction', 'rather', ""'cute"", 'one', 'where', 'two', 'would', ""'ve"", 'still', 'been', 'together', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'again', 'hear', 'name', 'mentioned', 'see', 'graduation', 'ceremony', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'moved', 'success', 'happiness', 'type', 'who', 'will', 'movie', 'straight', 'Max', 'college', 'career', 'well', 'DOES', 'lack', 'great', 'music', 'tunes', 'somehow', 'manage', 'go', 'being', 'terribly', 'missed', 'Goofy', 'fact', 'up', 'requiring', 'degree', 'course', 'much', 'son', 'chagrin', 'joining', 'first', 'year', 'college', 'overarching', 'plotline', 'movie', 'Max', 'PJ', 'Bobby', 'yes', 'DID', 'go', 'same', 'college', 'ambitious', 'X', 'Games', 'endeavor', 'unseat', 'Bradley', 'Uppercrust', 'III', 'one', 'few', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'found', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'meant', 'be', 'dislikable', 'actually', 'Gammas', 'skateboarding', 'kings', 'campus', 'course', 'intertwines', 'theme', 'father/son', 'bonding', 'how', 'Goofy', 'Max', 'see', 'focusing', 'goals', 'only', 'way', 'achieve', 'success', 'future', 'more', 'interesting', 'parts', 'movie', 'occur', 'when', 'Goofy', 'love', 'Sylvia', 'Marpole', 'librarian', 'who', 'shares', 'passion', '70', 'memorabilia', 'disco', 'when', 'PJ', 'up', ""'beret"", 'girl', 'who', 'out', 'Bean', 'Scene', 'Cafe.Goofy', 'falling', 'love', 'sounds', 'would', 'be', 'cliche', 'predictable', 'corny/cheesy', 'right', 'Actually', 'not', 'nicely', 'done', 'Sylvia', 'quite', 'compatible', 'interesting', 'well-developed', 'character', 'especially', 'only', 'being', 'introduced', 'one', 'film', 'same', 'smart', 'poetic', 'Beret', 'Girl', 'who', 'something', 'PJ', 'other', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'girlfriend', 'Character', 'design', 'development', 'actually', 'Goofy', 'Movies', 'quite', 'good', 'Sylvia', 'Beret', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'call', 'name', 'somehow', 'fitting', ""'re"", 'not', 'allowed', 'know', 'name', 'hmmm', 'reminded', 'vaguely', 'Chel', ""'The"", 'Road', 'El', 'Dorado', 'am', 'much', 'more', 'impressed', 'movie', 'great', 'cartoon', 'classics', 'modern', 'Goofy', 'Movies', 'have', 'evolved', 'clear', 'one', 'characters', 'who', 'always', 'out', 'wonderful', 'animation', 'never', 'disappoints']",An Extremely Goofy Movie Disney's  VHS
