Life can get so frustrating and the only thing that gets me through sometimes is my ability to look at the insanity of it all and laugh about it.I still remember the first time my husband and I saw Gabriel Iglesias (a.k.a. Fluffy) on Comedy Central.  His jokes about run-ins with the police made me laugh hysterically, which made my night.  Plus, his laugh is infectious.When I first saw a commercial for Gabriel Iglesias: Stand-Up Revolution, I knew I had to see it.  Hearing him talk about his friends all the time definitely made me eager to put a face with the name.  While I didn't laugh quite as much as I do when Fluffy is on stage, his friends are pretty funny.  I enjoyed this DVD and am glad to have it in my collection.",3,"OK, not great",1322870400,"12 3, 2011",2011,829,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'comedy', 'When', ""'m"", 'asked', 'what', 'favorite', 'thing', 'do', 'answer', 'laugh', 'Life', 'can', 'get', 'so', 'frustrating', 'only', 'thing', 'sometimes', 'ability', 'look', 'insanity', 'it.I', 'still', 'remember', 'first', 'time', 'husband', 'saw', 'Gabriel', 'Iglesias', 'a.k.a', 'Fluffy', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'jokes', 'run-ins', 'police', 'made', 'hysterically', 'made', 'night', 'laugh', 'infectious.When', 'first', 'saw', 'commercial', 'Gabriel', 'Iglesias', 'Stand-Up', 'Revolution', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'Hearing', 'talk', 'friends', 'time', 'definitely', 'made', 'eager', 'put', 'face', 'name', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'when', 'Fluffy', 'stage', 'friends', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'collection']",Gabriel Iglesias Presents: Stand-Up Revolution
