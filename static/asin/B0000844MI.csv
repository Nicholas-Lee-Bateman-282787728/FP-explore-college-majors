733798,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,B0000844MI,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[1, 1]","Friends - The Complete Third Season is definitely a standout season in my opinion. The cast really became like a unit the third season, their chemistry is strong and quite rare. Season 3 is full of gems like the releationship and sad break-up of Ross and Rachel. Joey and Chandler have some new pets - a chick and a duck! Monica tries to get over break-up from Richard and dates a billionaire named Pete towards the end of the season. Phoebe is probably the most genuine and funniest character, love her performance in The One with the Dollhouse. Excellent season, I highly recommend it, enjoy!",5,"""We were on a break!""",1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,594,"['Friends', 'Complete', 'Third', 'Season', 'definitely', 'standout', 'season', 'opinion', 'cast', 'really', 'became', 'unit', 'third', 'season', 'chemistry', 'strong', 'quite', 'rare', 'Season', '3', 'full', 'gems', 'releationship', 'sad', 'break-up', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'Joey', 'Chandler', 'have', 'new', 'pets', 'chick', 'duck', 'Monica', 'get', 'break-up', 'Richard', 'billionaire', 'named', 'Pete', 'end', 'season', 'Phoebe', 'probably', 'most', 'genuine', 'funniest', 'character', 'love', 'performance', 'One', 'Dollhouse', 'Excellent', 'season', 'highly', 'recommend']",Friends: Season 3

733801,A2DRHY9HJ4DE1F,B0000844MI,Ahmed,"[52, 58]","Definitely one of the best and most exciting seasons of Friends, it's the season where Ross and Rachel are; still dating, break-up, and eventually decide to get back together by the season's end. In between lots of events take place, e.g. Monica gets a new boyfriend (Pete the millionaire) and Joey &Chandler; buy birds (a chick and a duck). The season features some of the all-time favourite Friends episodes! I love the packaging! You take it out of the cover and the DVD version is like a folder. It opens up into like 6 pages with the DVDs and episodes listings. I got this for a more expensive price so this price is a lot better! You can also choose to have subtitles (choice is from 4 different languages) or you can choose to have none.The episodes are:Disc 1:The one with the Princess Leia Fantasy- Ross' secret fantasy doesn't stay secret for long after he confides in Rachel. Chandler begins to rekindle his relationship with ex-girlfriend Janice.The one where no one's ready- Ross gets riled when his friends fail to be ready on time for a museum fundraiser.The one with the jam- Monica tries to get over Richard by making jam but she gets obsessed.

733805,AU84JL8P3AQLE,B0000844MI,Big Daniel McFoot,"[2, 7]","I think it is safe to say that I'm a `Friends' fanatic. I've sat glued to the telly through seven seasons and laughed through over one hundred and fifty episodes. So now I want to share my love of this fantastic programme with my fellow Amazainians.`Friends' is an American sitcom about six friends in their early thirties living in New York. The comedy shows them struggle with their careers and ill-fated romances, but they always have their friends to be there for them at the end of the day, which is what the show is all about. The programme is as near to perfect as television gets - hilarious scripts, incredible acting, and not to mention an amazing theme song by the Rembrants, `I'll Be There For You'.So who are the six friends that make this show what it is?MONICA:Courtney Cox plays Monica Geller, the Mother hen of the group. She is incredibly competitive and more than just a little neurotic - she is obsessed with cleaning and keeping order. As a child she was a bit of a compulsive eater, and consequently became extremely overweight, but after hearing Chandler calling her fat as a teenager she took it upon herself to lose the extra pounds (about a hundred of them!). Her love of food inspired her to become a chef, although her career is rather shaky in earlier series. Monica seems to have an attraction for the wrong type of men, which doesn't really help her desire for marriage and a family. However, she found true love at last with Chandler, and season seven ends with their wedding.ROSS:David Schwimmer plays Ross Geller, Monica's geeky elder brother. After doing well at high school and college he became a palaeontologist, and later a professor at New York University. He is a family man at heart, but isn't very good at marriage. His first wife left him ... not for another man, but for another woman! His second marriage didn't work out because he said the wrong name at the alter, and his third marriage to Rachel was only the result of a drunken night in Las Vegas and they were divorced soon after. Oh well, perhaps if he keeps trying he'll get there in the end!RACHEL:Jennifer Aniston plays Rachel Green, who is a bit of a Barbie-doll (in a nice way) and was very spoilt by her father. She ditched her dentist fianc&eacute; Barry at the alter because he looked like `Mister Potato Head' and went to live with her old high school best friend Monica instead. Rachel then got her first ever job as a waitress in the coffee house where the friends hang out, `Central Perk'. She's gone up in the world a lot since then and currently works for Ralph Lauren, where she has her own personal assistant Tag (who she not-very-professionally dated!). Rachel and Ross have an on and off relationship throughout the show, but viewers are still waiting to find out if they ever get back together again.CHANDLER:Matthew Perry plays Chandler Bing, a wisecracking computer programmer. Still mentally scarred by his childhood when he discovered his parents were getting divorced because his father was gay, he is, like Monica, very neurotic but covers his hang-ups by joking. He too has had many relationship difficulties, mostly because he always found nothing but flaws in all the women he dated. Now he has found happiness with Monica, his first successful relationship, and she has succeeded in bringing out the more mature, emotional side to his character. Ahhh.PHEOBE:Lisa Kudrow plays Pheobe Buffay, the hippy folksinger who plays her guitar in the coffee house singing (badly) ridiculous songs like `Smelly Cat'. Pheobe is a masseur, hates her furniture to be mass-produced and often believes she is in contact with her dead grandmother. Ok, so she is pretty weird, but that's hardly surprising considering the upbringing she has had. When Pheobe was only fourteen, her adopted mother committed suicide by putting her head in an oven, and left Pheobe and her twin sister to look after themselves. But considering all that she nearly always manages to have a smile on her face.JOEY:Matt LeBlanc plays Joey Tribbiani, an American-Italian actor who is unemployed the majority of the time and yet still thinks he's `all that'. He found his five minutes of fame as Doctor Drake Ramoray on `Days of our Lives', but his character was killed off by falling down an elevator shaft. He's a bit of a stud when it comes to women, and practically brings a different girl back to his apartment every night. He shared an apartment with Chandler for a few years, although most of the time he couldn't afford to pay his half and borrowed the money from Chandler. Joey doesn't have much in the way of brains or cash, but he's certainly very loveable!Those are the six main characters, and together they make up one of the funniest shows I have ever seen. Every episode has it's own unique shine to it, and I'm usually in stitches all the way through. Definitely a TV show you don't want to miss!",5,I'll Be There For You,1045094400,"02 13, 2003",2003,4900,"['think', 'safe', 'say', ""'m"", 'Friends', 'fanatic', ""'ve"", 'sat', 'glued', 'telly', 'seven', 'seasons', 'laughed', 'one', 'hundred', 'fifty', 'episodes', 'So', 'now', 'want', 'share', 'love', 'fantastic', 'programme', 'fellow', 'Amazainians.', 'Friends', 'American', 'sitcom', 'six', 'friends', 'early', 'thirties', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'comedy', 'struggle', 'careers', 'ill-fated', 'romances', 'always', 'have', 'friends', 'be', 'there', 'end', 'day', 'what', 'show', 'programme', 'as', 'near', 'perfect', 'television', 'hilarious', 'scripts', 'incredible', 'acting', 'not', 'mention', 'amazing', 'theme', 'song', 'Rembrants', ""'ll"", 'Be', ""You'.So"", 'who', 'are', 'six', 'friends', 'make', 'show', 'what', 'MONICA', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'Monica', 'Geller', 'Mother', 'hen', 'group', 'incredibly', 'competitive', 'more', 'just', 'little', 'neurotic', 'obsessed', 'cleaning', 'keeping', 'order', 'child', 'was', 'bit', 'compulsive', 'eater', 'consequently', 'became', 'extremely', 'overweight', 'hearing', 'Chandler', 'calling', 'fat', 'teenager', 'took', 'upon', 'lose', 'extra', 'pounds', 'hundred', 'love', 'food', 'inspired', 'become', 'chef', 'career', 'rather', 'shaky', 'earlier', 'series', 'Monica', 'have', 'attraction', 'wrong', 'type', 'men', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'desire', 'marriage', 'family', 'However', 'found', 'true', 'love', 'last', 'Chandler', 'season', 'seven', 'ends', 'wedding.ROSS', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Ross', 'Geller', 'Monica', 'geeky', 'elder', 'brother', 'doing', 'well', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'became', 'palaeontologist', 'later', 'professor', 'New', 'York', 'University', 'family', 'man', 'heart', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'marriage', 'first', 'wife', 'left', 'not', 'man', 'woman', 'second', 'marriage', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'said', 'wrong', 'name', 'alter', 'third', 'marriage', 'Rachel', 'was', 'only', 'result', 'drunken', 'night', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'were', 'divorced', 'soon', 'Oh', 'well', 'perhaps', 'trying', ""'ll"", 'get', 'there', 'end', 'RACHEL', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Rachel', 'Green', 'who', 'bit', 'Barbie-doll', 'nice', 'way', 'was', 'very', 'spoilt', 'father', 'ditched', 'dentist', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Barry', 'alter', 'looked', 'Mister', 'Potato', 'Head', 'went', 'live', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'best', 'friend', 'Monica', 'instead', 'Rachel', 'then', 'got', 'first', 'ever', 'job', 'waitress', 'coffee', 'house', 'where', 'friends', 'hang', 'out', 'Central', 'Perk', 'gone', 'up', 'world', 'lot', 'then', 'currently', 'Ralph', 'Lauren', 'where', 'own', 'personal', 'assistant', 'Tag', 'who', 'not-very-professionally', 'dated', 'Rachel', 'Ross', 'have', 'relationship', 'show', 'viewers', 'are', 'still', 'waiting', 'find', 'out', 'ever', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'again.CHANDLER', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'Chandler', 'Bing', 'wisecracking', 'computer', 'programmer', 'Still', 'mentally', 'scarred', 'childhood', 'when', 'discovered', 'parents', 'were', 'getting', 'divorced', 'father', 'was', 'gay', 'Monica', 'very', 'neurotic', 'hang-ups', 'joking', 'too', 'had', 'many', 'relationship', 'difficulties', 'mostly', 'always', 'found', 'nothing', 'flaws', 'women', 'dated', 'Now', 'found', 'happiness', 'Monica', 'first', 'successful', 'relationship', 'succeeded', 'bringing', 'out', 'more', 'mature', 'emotional', 'side', 'character', 'Ahhh.PHEOBE', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Pheobe', 'Buffay', 'hippy', 'folksinger', 'who', 'guitar', 'coffee', 'house', 'singing', 'badly', 'ridiculous', 'songs', 'Smelly', 'Cat', 'Pheobe', 'masseur', 'furniture', 'be', 'mass-produced', 'often', 'contact', 'dead', 'grandmother', 'Ok', 'pretty', 'weird', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'considering', 'upbringing', 'had', 'When', 'Pheobe', 'was', 'only', 'fourteen', 'adopted', 'mother', 'committed', 'suicide', 'putting', 'head', 'oven', 'left', 'Pheobe', 'twin', 'sister', 'look', 'considering', 'nearly', 'always', 'have', 'smile', 'face.JOEY', 'Matt', 'LeBlanc', 'Joey', 'Tribbiani', 'American-Italian', 'actor', 'who', 'unemployed', 'majority', 'time', 'yet', 'still', 'found', 'five', 'minutes', 'fame', 'Doctor', 'Drake', 'Ramoray', 'Days', 'Lives', 'character', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'falling', 'down', 'elevator', 'shaft', 'bit', 'stud', 'when', 'women', 'practically', 'different', 'girl', 'back', 'apartment', 'night', 'shared', 'apartment', 'Chandler', 'few', 'years', 'most', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'pay', 'half', 'borrowed', 'money', 'Chandler', 'Joey', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'way', 'brains', 'cash', 'certainly', 'very', 'loveable', 'are', 'six', 'main', 'characters', 'together', 'make', 'up', 'one', 'funniest', 'shows', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'episode', 'own', 'unique', 'shine', ""'m"", 'usually', 'stitches', 'way', 'Definitely', 'TV', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss']",Friends: Season 3
733806,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,B0000844MI,Bookphile,"[2, 2]","While Friends has always struck me as a show that hit the ground running, the third season is where it really hits its stride.  It's at this point that the show becomes about more than funny episodes as it's the season when we really start to learn a lot about the characters.  Perhaps reviewing this season is most easily done by highlighting the episodes that contribute to each character's story arc.Monica's season is off to a bad start as she does her best to try to get over Richard.  It's also the first time that we really begin to see just how desperately she wants to have children, as evidenced by ""The One with the Jam"".  This is a theme that becomes very central to her character, all the way up until the show's final episode.  We also get to see Monica fall in love with a guy to whom she is initially not attracted and who seems to be the perfect man until he begins to pursue a rather suicidal goal.  ""The One with the Tiny T-Shirt"", ""The One with a Chick and a Duck"" and ""The One with the Ultimate Fighting Champion"" are central to this story arc.For Rachel, everything seems to be going really well--except for her job.  The much celebrated Ross and Rachel relationship is in full swing at the start of the season but things start to break down in episodes like ""The One with All the Jealousy"" where Ross can't deal with Rachel's handsome new coworker and friend.  I particularly like how Rachel begins to come into her own this season and realize that she can follow her passion in life rather than marking time at the coffee shop.  While she is happy with Ross, she also begins to appreciate the value of having her own career and of doing something solely for her own fulfillment.Phoebe begins to learn more about her origins in this season and her storyline is very much enhanced by the priceless episodes in which guest star Giovanni Ribisi plays her half brother, who she meets in ""The One with Frank Jr.""  We also find out about Phoebe's past musical career aspirations in ""The One with Phoebe's Ex-Partner"" whose ending is simply classic as said partner sells Phoebe out once more, this time by pitching ""Smelly Cat"" to a kitty litter company.  By the end of the season, Phoebe learns the shocking truth about her parents in ""The One at the Beach"", which is a packed episode due to its advancing multiple plotlines.Joey shows unexpected sensitivity this season when he falls in love with a haughty co-star and then has his heart broken.  It's particularly funny to watch him call all of the women he has slept with in the past (""The One with the Dollhouse"") so that he can apologize to them for treating them the way he himself has just been treated.  ""The One with the Screamer"" is also classic Joey because we are treated to a snippet of a scene from one of the downright awful plays in which he has the lead role.Chandler's on-again-off-again relationship with the sweet but irritating Janice continues into this season with the particularly funny ""The One with the Metaphorical Tunnel"" in which Chandler gets a bit overzealous in his rush to prove he's over his fear of commitment and then commiserates with Rachel and Monica.  Janice exits the scene once more when Joey witnesses something in the hilarious ""The One with the Race Car Bed"" that will ultimately lead to the dissolution of that relationship.  In typical Chandler fashion, he then finds himself finding fault with yet another woman in ""The One with Phoebe's Ex-Partner"", though he is mature enough to admit that he's being rather terrible for it.  At the end of the season, we begin to get a hint of the crush Chandler seems to be developing on Monica when in ""The One with the Beach"" he offers to be her boyfriend if she can't find another.This is also a good season for the development of Ross and we begin to see just how petty he can be--but his pettiness is in equal measure to his kindness.  He lets his outrageous jealousy get the best of him in ""The One with All the Jealousy"" and then he refuses to listen to Rachel and humiliates her at work in ""The One Where Ross & Rachel Take a Break""--and then follows this up by sleeping with another woman.  However, in ""The One with the Tiny T-Shirt"" we see how kind he can be and he follows this up with a selfless act which results in his missing his much-anticipated chance to be on the Discovery Channel.Though there are so many varied plotlines during this season, we are shown over and over examples of the devotion these six people have to one another and I think it can't help but make the average viewer feel a bit envious.",5,A truly great season,1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,4577,"['Friends', 'always', 'struck', 'show', 'hit', 'ground', 'running', 'third', 'season', 'where', 'really', 'stride', 'point', 'show', 'more', 'funny', 'episodes', 'season', 'when', 'really', 'start', 'learn', 'lot', 'characters', 'Perhaps', 'reviewing', 'season', 'most', 'easily', 'done', 'highlighting', 'episodes', 'contribute', 'character', 'story', 'arc.Monica', 'season', 'bad', 'start', 'best', 'try', 'get', 'over', 'Richard', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'begin', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'desperately', 'have', 'children', 'evidenced', 'One', 'Jam', 'theme', 'very', 'central', 'character', 'way', 'show', 'final', 'episode', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'Monica', 'fall', 'love', 'guy', 'whom', 'initially', 'not', 'attracted', 'who', 'be', 'perfect', 'man', 'pursue', 'rather', 'suicidal', 'goal', 'One', 'Tiny', 'T-Shirt', 'One', 'Chick', 'Duck', 'One', 'Ultimate', 'Fighting', 'Champion', 'are', 'central', 'story', 'arc.For', 'Rachel', 'everything', 'be', 'going', 'really', 'well', 'job', 'much', 'celebrated', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'relationship', 'full', 'swing', 'start', 'season', 'things', 'start', 'break', 'down', 'episodes', 'One', 'Jealousy', 'where', 'Ross', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'Rachel', 'handsome', 'new', 'coworker', 'friend', 'particularly', 'how', 'Rachel', 'come', 'own', 'season', 'realize', 'can', 'follow', 'passion', 'life', 'rather', 'marking', 'time', 'coffee', 'shop', 'happy', 'Ross', 'also', 'appreciate', 'value', 'having', 'own', 'career', 'doing', 'something', 'solely', 'own', 'fulfillment.Phoebe', 'learn', 'more', 'origins', 'season', 'storyline', 'very', 'much', 'enhanced', 'priceless', 'episodes', 'guest', 'star', 'Giovanni', 'Ribisi', 'half', 'brother', 'who', 'One', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'also', 'find', 'out', 'Phoebe', 'past', 'musical', 'career', 'aspirations', 'One', 'Phoebe', 'Ex-Partner', 'ending', 'simply', 'classic', 'said', 'partner', 'Phoebe', 'out', 'once', 'more', 'time', 'pitching', 'Smelly', 'Cat', 'kitty', 'litter', 'company', 'end', 'season', 'Phoebe', 'shocking', 'truth', 'parents', 'One', 'Beach', 'packed', 'episode', 'due', 'advancing', 'multiple', 'plotlines.Joey', 'shows', 'unexpected', 'sensitivity', 'season', 'when', 'love', 'haughty', 'co-star', 'then', 'heart', 'broken', 'particularly', 'funny', 'watch', 'call', 'women', 'slept', 'past', 'One', 'Dollhouse', 'so', 'can', 'apologize', 'treating', 'way', 'just', 'been', 'treated', 'One', 'Screamer', 'also', 'classic', 'Joey', 'are', 'treated', 'snippet', 'scene', 'one', 'downright', 'awful', 'plays', 'lead', 'role.Chandler', 'on-again-off-again', 'relationship', 'sweet', 'irritating', 'Janice', 'season', 'particularly', 'funny', 'One', 'Metaphorical', 'Tunnel', 'Chandler', 'bit', 'overzealous', 'rush', 'prove', 'fear', 'commitment', 'then', 'Rachel', 'Monica', 'Janice', 'scene', 'once', 'more', 'when', 'Joey', 'something', 'hilarious', 'One', 'Race', 'Car', 'Bed', 'will', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'dissolution', 'relationship', 'typical', 'Chandler', 'fashion', 'then', 'finding', 'fault', 'yet', 'woman', 'One', 'Phoebe', 'Ex-Partner', 'mature', 'enough', 'admit', 'being', 'rather', 'terrible', 'end', 'season', 'begin', 'get', 'hint', 'crush', 'Chandler', 'be', 'developing', 'Monica', 'when', 'One', 'Beach', 'be', 'boyfriend', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'another.This', 'also', 'good', 'season', 'development', 'Ross', 'begin', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'petty', 'can', 'be', 'pettiness', 'equal', 'measure', 'kindness', 'outrageous', 'jealousy', 'get', 'best', 'One', 'Jealousy', 'then', 'listen', 'Rachel', 'work', 'One', 'Where', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'Take', 'Break', 'then', 'up', 'sleeping', 'woman', 'However', 'One', 'Tiny', 'T-Shirt', 'see', 'how', 'kind', 'can', 'be', 'up', 'selfless', 'act', 'results', 'missing', 'much-anticipated', 'chance', 'be', 'Discovery', 'Channel.Though', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'varied', 'plotlines', 'season', 'are', 'shown', 'examples', 'devotion', 'six', 'people', 'have', 'one', 'think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'make', 'average', 'viewer', 'feel', 'bit', 'envious']",Friends: Season 3

Winner of innumerable television awards, the show features the lives of six friends in their late-twenties/early-thirties living in New York City - Monica Geller (Courteney Cox), Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), and Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry). The six friends spend the majority of their time in a coffee house named ""Central Perk"" or in either Monica's apartment or Joey and Chandler's apartment.The Friends (Season 3) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere where Chandler gets back together with Janice (Maggie Wheeler), and Janice forces Joey to bond with her. This episode also features Ross's Princess Leia fantasy which Rachel fulfills. Episode 57 features a life-long Thanksgiving football rivalry between Ross and Monica, and in the following episode, Rachel quits her job at Central Perk.

NBC welcomed the actors back in September of 1996 with their third season that features more laughs, more tears, and more of our best friends.Monica is utterly heartbroken after having to call off her relationship with Richard. She tries everything that could to get over him, but nothing works until her father comes over to help cheer her up. Chandler has realized that he is crazy about Janice and he promises to continue dating her, instead of dumping her. That is until Joey and Monica find Janice kissing her ex-husband. Chandler confronts her and then realizes that he does not want to stand in their way. So, he lets Janice give her ex-husband a second chance. Ross and Rachel continue to move on in their loving relationship, until a young man named Mark offers Rachel a job at Bloomingdales. Rachel gets the job, where she works as one of two assistants in purchasing. Mark is the other assistant, which sets off a jealous Ross. They argue about it constantly, until Rachel requests that they should take a break. Ross, thinking that she want to break up, goes off to a bar with Chandler and Joey. At this bar, Ross is seduced by Chloe, the girl who works at the copyplace. The next morning, Ross wakes up and receives a phone message from Rachel, apologizing for acting the way she did and wants to end their break and move on with their relationship. That is until Gunther, the geeky platinum blonde boss, who has a major crush on Rachel, spills the beans to Rachel about Ross' one-night stand. Rachel and Ross argue bitterly about it, leading into a heartbreaking ending to their relationship.Monica happens to meet another guy named Pete Becker, who is a millionaire in the computer business. At first, Monica is not attracted to Pete. She likes Pete very much. She claims that Pete has everything she wants in a man, but she is somehow not attracted to him, until they have their first kiss. Their first kiss helped Monica become attracted to Pete. They date for awhile, but Monica breaks up with him when Pete decides that he cares more about becoming The Ultimate Fighting Champion, than he does of her.Joey has not really gotten far with his acting career, since he had been fired from ""Days Of Our Lives"". He had gotten the male lead role in a play entitled, ""Boxing Day"". His co-star, Kate, who plays the female lead role, is dating the director, but she has feelings for Joey, but she hides them by being a b*tch.Phoebe happens to meet her brother, Frank, Jr. Frank is a little out there, but he's a great younger brother. Phoebe cares for him deeply, which is why she becomes so crazed when she finds out that Frank, only 18 years old, is engaged to his high school Home Ec teacher, Alice Knight, who is at the age of 44. But Phoebe realizes that the two are in love, so she lets go. Not only does Phoebe find out about having a younger brother. She finds out that a friend of her mother's claims to know where her father is. Her mother's friend, whose name is also Phoebe, lives in Montak. Phoebe invites the gang down with her for the weekend. What Phoebe finds out that her mother is not her mother, but her stepmother. Her stepmother married her father. Phoebe's real mother is her stepmother's friend, Phoebe. At this time, Rachel begins flirting with Ross, acting like nothing had happened, acting like they never broke up. Ross has already started a relationship with a girl named Bonnie, who is friends with Phoebe. Bonnie used to shave her head quite often. Desperate to have Ross back, Rachel convinced Bonnie to shave her head again, hoping it will turn off Ross and send him running back to Rachel. Ross and Rachel talk about what she did to make Bonnie shave her head, until Rachel confesses that, ""I broke up with you because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you"". She realized it was true and they decided to get back together...after he ends his relationship with Bonnie.There is more fun in this whole season. You have laughed yourselves to death with seasons one and two. Now, it's time to laugh yourself to death with season three. So, buy a copy of the complete third season. Remember, they'll be there for you.

733814,AW7CV7F94ULDU,B0000844MI,"Chris ""www.twitter.com/chrisMibacache""","[1, 2]","The Third Season of Friends, for me, was quite an improvement over Season Two. For Season Two I had a hard time picking the top 5 episodes as none of them were THAT great. Now for Season 3 I can have an easier time as there are more better episodes to pick from.During the third season, one thing that bugged me a bit was Matthew Perry, he was very seriously ill during this season with his Alcohol and drug problems and therefore his physical appearance on the show was extremely gaunt, he was very very thin. Whenever I watch season 3 and I see him all I can think about is the actual trauma going on in his life and that all this Chandler stuff is fake. Anyway apart from that the 3rd season was quite good!Though it contains one of my least favourite epsiodes, The One With The Football (a lot will dissagree..I am NOT a football fan), Season Three has its share of good moments.My Personal Top 5 Episodes are:The One With The Princess Leia FantasyThe One With The Flashback (My Favourite of the Season)The One With Phoebe's EX PartnerThe One Where Ross and Rachel Take A BreakThe One With The Morning AfterSeason Three of the show has a better bunch of shows than the previous I think. Though one other thing the show could've done without was Monica's new relationahip with the ''ultimate fighting champion''(????!?!?!) guy. That wasn't really needed.An emotional episode was The One With The Morning After. The scene with Ross and Rachels final decision to break up where the rest of the friends are stuck in the room has David Schwimmer and Jennifer Anistons best acting to date. You can really feel the emotion there, BELIEVE ME!Oh well, Season Three is pretty good, it starts the trend of good seasons.

733815,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B0000844MI,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 1]","I think most fans of Friends consider Season 3 to be the best.  It certainly sets up much of the ""extended universe"" for the rest of the series.  For example, Tom Sellick returns as Richard, Monica's dentist and ex-boyfriend.  Phoebe's family life becomes more complicated.  The chick and the duck appear as Chandler and Joey's pets.  We start to see behaviour that, on hindsight, foreshadow's the relationship between Monica and Chandler.  And, of course, Ross utters his famous catchphrase to justify why he slept with another girl when he was still in love with Rachel: ""We were on a break!""There are some extremely funny episodes in Season 3.  I especially like the absurdity of the chick and the duck, the storyline of Monica's new boyfriend wanting to become the Ultimate Fighting champion, and Joey's new play (specifically, its self-absorbed director).  Unfortunately, the season spends far too much time on the Ross-Rachel soap opera storyline - the season bogs down for 4 or 5 episodes that are not particularly funny and feel manipulative (of the audience's emotions) on repeated viewings.  Perhaps it's just that I never invested much in the Ross-Rachel relationship because they were my least favourite characters in those seasons.  Not only that, the setup is artificial - we the audience never believe in the possibility of Rachel cheating on Ross with the cute guy at the office, and so have no patience with Ross's jealousy.So, overall, this season is probably the definitive season of Friends.

That's what the writers and cast of FRIENDS accomplished in this memorable third season.The narrative anchor of the season is Ross' and Rachel's breakup.  Their conflicting anger and desire to get back together appear rhythically, right up to the season finale, 'The One at the Beach'.  Who was going to miss the fourth season after the brilliant ending, where Ross has to choose between Rachel - his forever love - and his beautiful latest fling, with her tragically shaved head?  In retrospect, his choice seems inevitable, but as Season Three closed down, they all had us guessing.While Ross and Rachel are figuring themselves out, each of their fellow characters gains greater definition and new depths of humor.  We know them better now, and instantly catch every reference to their distinct packages of loopiness and obsession.The writers must have known by this time what a winner they had, as well as how far to venture without ruining the recipe.  Their confidence shows.By this season, FRIENDS felt to faithful viewers less like a promising sitcom and more like a slice of life, even of our own lives.No doubt about it, Season Three was one of the best.",5,Hitting their stride,1125187200,"08 28, 2005",2005,1196,"['Talk', 'hitting', 'stride', 'what', 'writers', 'cast', 'FRIENDS', 'accomplished', 'memorable', 'third', 'season.The', 'narrative', 'anchor', 'season', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'breakup', 'conflicting', 'anger', 'desire', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'appear', 'rhythically', 'right', 'up', 'season', 'finale', 'One', 'Beach', 'Who', 'was', 'going', 'miss', 'fourth', 'season', 'brilliant', 'ending', 'where', 'Ross', 'choose', 'Rachel', 'forever', 'love', 'beautiful', 'latest', 'fling', 'tragically', 'shaved', 'head', 'retrospect', 'choice', 'inevitable', 'Season', 'Three', 'closed', 'down', 'had', 'guessing.While', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'are', 'figuring', 'fellow', 'characters', 'gains', 'greater', 'definition', 'new', 'depths', 'humor', 'know', 'better', 'now', 'instantly', 'catch', 'reference', 'distinct', 'packages', 'loopiness', 'obsession.The', 'writers', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'time', 'what', 'winner', 'had', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'far', 'venture', 'ruining', 'recipe', 'confidence', 'shows.By', 'season', 'FRIENDS', 'felt', 'faithful', 'viewers', 'less', 'promising', 'sitcom', 'more', 'slice', 'life', 'even', 'own', 'lives.No', 'doubt', 'Season', 'Three', 'was', 'one', 'best']",Friends: Season 3

Ross (David Schwimmer) becomes a really annoying, insensitive, whining weenie; couldn't the writers have come up with a more human, moving reason for his break-up with Rachel (Jennifer Aniston)?  Would a couple of single guys like Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) really lavish so much time and affection on a chick and a duck?  Does anything we see about Monica's (Courtney Cox) new boyfriend, Pete (Jon Favreau), account for his sudden, unquenchable desire to become the world's ultimate fighting champion?  No, but I guess the writers wanted to do an episode about ultimate fighting, so there we have it.Friends fans, before you clobber me with ""unhelpful"" ratings, bear in mind that I did give this season 4 stars.

733820,A3IX9JTCKX7PH,B0000844MI,Deanna,"[214, 220]","""Friends - The Complete Third Season"" is a must-have for any Friends fan! I consider this to be one of Friends' best seasons for two reasons. One, being the sharp and very witty dialogue and happenings (Chandler & Joey acquiring a duck & a chick, Phoebe's boyfriend's ""hanging"" problem, Chandler acting like a woman, etc.). The second, is Ross and Rachel's breakup. David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston were heartbreakingly believable in the parting of one of TV's greatest couples ever.In this collection, you get the following episodes:1. ""The One With the Princess Leia Fantasy""- Monica's still gloomy over her breakup with Richard. Ross tells Rachel about his Princess Leia fantasy.2. ""The One Where No One's Ready""- Ross and Phoebe are the only one's dressed 30 minutes before a museum fundraiser.3. ""The One With the Jam""- Monica tries to get over Richard by making jam. Then she decides that she wants to have a baby on her own, so she gets a list of sperm donors, only to discover Joey is on the list.4. ""The One With the Metaphorical Tunnel""- Ross is shocked when Ben plays with a Barbie doll. Chandler decides to ""go through the tunnel"" and make a commitment to Janice.5. ""The One With Frank Jr.""- Phoebe reunites with her half brother, Frank Jr. The gang discusses who would be on their freebie list (five celebrities they'd be allowed to sleep with and not jeopardize their relationship).6. ""The One With the Flashback""- Janice asks everybody if they've ever almost hooked up, causing the gang to have a flashback to three years earlier. We see Chandler searching for a roommate & hitting on Rachel (who's having cold-feet over her impending marriage), Ross making out on a pool table with Phoebe after he learns his wife is a lesbian and Monica with a crush on Joey.7. ""The One With the Race Car Bed""- Ross is dreading a dinner with Rachel's father. Joey goes with Monica to return a race car bed that was accidentally delivered to her apartment.8. ""The One With the Poking Device""- Rachel and Monica baby-sit Ben for the afternoon, but Monica leaves a knot on his head after bumping him into the wall. Joey tells Chandler that he caught Janice kissing her ex-husband.9. ""The One With the Football""- It's Thanksgiving and the gang goes over to the park to play football and some sibling rivalry between Ross and Monica is reawakened.10. ""The One Where Rachel Quits""- Just before Christmas, Gunther tells Rachel she needs to be retrained as a waitress, so she quits. Monica gets hooked on Mint Treasures that Ross is selling.11. ""The One Where Chandler Can't Remember Which Sister""- A drunk Chandler hooks up with one of Joey's sisters, but he can't recall which one. Rachel meets Mark, who helps her get a job at Bloomingdale's.12. ""The One With All the Jealousy""- Ross gets jealous over the fact that Mark takes Rachel to lunch. Monica goes out with Julio, a hunky co-worker at the 50s diner.13. ""The One Where Monica & Richard Are Friends""- Monica runs into Richard at the video store. Phoebe's new boyfriend unknowingly ""hangs out of his shorts,"" to Chandler's horror.14. ""The One With Phoebe's Ex-Partner""- Phoebe reunites with a former musical collaborator. Chandler meets Ginger, the girl whose wooden-leg Joey threw in a fire.15. ""The One Where Ross & Rachel Take A Break""- After Rachel tells Ross she has to cancel their anniversary plans, he shows up at her office with a picnic basket. She tells him they need to take a break from their relationship and he then sleeps with Chloe, the hot girl from the copy store.16. ""The One With the Morning After""- Ross frantically tries to keep Rachel from finding out what he did, but Gunther spills the beans.17. ""The One Without the Ski Trip""- Rachel invites everybody besides Ross on a ski trip. On their way, the gang gets locked out of the car at a desolate rest stop.18. ""The One With the Hypnosis Tape""- Chandler has been listening to a hypnosis tape that's supposed to help him stop smoking. The only problem is, the tape's geared toward women and he starts acting very feminine.19. ""The One With the Tiny T-Shirt""- Mark confesses his crush to Rachel and asks her out. Ross and Rachel return each other's belongings.20. ""The One With the Dollhouse""- Monica inherits her Aunt Sylvia's dollhouse. Rachel's boss expresses her interest in Chandler.21. ""The One With A Chick & A Duck""- Joey gets a baby chicken (that Chandler names Yasmine). Chandler tries to dump the chick off at a shelter, but ends up bringing home a duck instead.22. ""The One With the Screamer""- Rachel's new boyfriend (Ben Stiller) turns out to have a raging temper, but it only shows in front of Ross.23. ""The One With Ross's Thing""- Ross discovers a growth on his lower back and he goes to see Phoebe's herbalist. Pheeb's is juggling two guys: a firefighter and a teacher.24. ""The One With the Ultimate Fighting Champion""- Pete, Monica's boyfriend, gets whipped in his Ultimate Fighting match. Phoebe asks Rachel if she can set Ross up with her friend, Bonnie, who used to be bald.25. ""The One At the Beach""- Phoebe and the gang head to Montauk, New York, so she can meet an old friend (also named Phoebe) of her mother's. During the trip, Rachel tricks Bonnie into shaving her head, which is a total turn-off for Ross, who ends up kissing Rachel.",5,One of Friends' best seasons!,1042156800,"01 10,

Still, Season three gave us some of the most important hallmark epsiodes in the series-- ""TOW No One's Ready,"" classic Friends and is the beginning of the ""bottle"" epsiode tradition on the show where all six characters were in one room together driving each other crazy; ""TOW the Football,"" a classic Thanksgiving episode where the true dorkiness of the Gellar family is revealed and of course the episodes that marked the beginning of the end (or the beginning of the end of the beginning or something) of Ross and Rachel, ""TOW Ross and Rachel Take a Break"" and ""TOW the Morning After"" Schwimmer and Aniston are both so good and so real in these episodes and I remember mourning the loss of the relationship just as much as Ross and Rachel did. Other hysterical episodes from this season include ""TOW the Flashback,"" ""TOW Frank Jr.,"" ""TOW the Race Car Bed,"" ""TOW Monica and Richard are Just Friends,"" ""TOW Phoebe's ex partner"" and ""The One Without the Ski Trip"" As I said before the episodes that closed the season didn't seem to have the same punch to them that the earlier ones did and it seemed as if the show was becoming more routine and formulamatic (an impression that quickly dissappears with the next stellar season). The actors are also more comfortable in their roles and are beginning to explore different aspects to their characters. Courteney Cox does a commendable job as Monica tries to deal with her break up from Richard, and Matt LeBlanc gives audiences a preview of what's in store for Joey later in the series, as Joey for the first time actually feels a deep attatchment toward a woman (Kate Miller). Lisa Kudrow is still stellar here as Phoebe continues her struggle to find family (a struggle that ends in an unpredictable way in ""TO at the Beach""). Matthew Perry, who I believe was struggling with his addiction at this time,  also shows a different side of Chandler as once committment weary Chandler begins to search for a meaningful relationship. And as mentioned before Schwimmer and Aniston are both so good and real in this season and steal the season with their performances in the episodes dealing with Ross and Rachel's breakup. While the last six episodes or so are not the best in the Friends collection, the season is still worth while and hit some really high points.",4,Comfortable..,1148515200,"05 25, 2006",2006,2531,"['third', 'season', 'Friends', 'showed', 'show', 'had', 'found', 'comfortable', 'groove', 'season', 'wore', 'seemed', 'writer', 'were', 'starting', 'lose', 'spark', 'made', 'first', 'two', 'season', 'such', 'successes', 'Still', 'Season', 'three', 'gave', 'most', 'important', 'hallmark', 'epsiodes', 'series', 'TOW', 'No', 'One', 'Ready', 'classic', 'Friends', 'beginning', 'bottle', 'tradition', 'show', 'where', 'six', 'characters', 'were', 'one', 'room', 'together', 'driving', 'other', 'crazy', 'Football', 'classic', 'Thanksgiving', 'episode', 'where', 'true', 'dorkiness', 'Gellar', 'family', 'revealed', 'course', 'episodes', 'marked', 'beginning', 'end', 'beginning', 'end', 'beginning', 'something', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'TOW', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'Take', 'Break', 'TOW', 'Morning', 'Schwimmer', 'Aniston', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'so', 'real', 'episodes', 'remember', 'mourning', 'loss', 'relationship', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'did', 'Other', 'hysterical', 'episodes', 'season', 'include', 'TOW', 'Flashback', 'TOW', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'TOW', 'Race', 'Car', 'Bed', 'TOW', 'Monica', 'Richard', 'are', 'Just', 'Friends', 'TOW', 'Phoebe', 'ex', 'partner', 'One', 'Ski', 'Trip', 'said', 'episodes', 'closed', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'same', 'punch', 'earlier', 'ones', 'did', 'seemed', 'show', 'was', 'becoming', 'more', 'routine', 'formulamatic', 'impression', 'quickly', 'next', 'stellar', 'season', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'more', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'are', 'beginning', 'explore', 'different', 'aspects', 'characters', 'Courteney', 'Cox', 'commendable', 'job', 'Monica', 'deal', 'break', 'up', 'Richard', 'Matt', 'LeBlanc', 'audiences', 'preview', 'what', 'store', 'Joey', 'later', 'series', 'Joey', 'first', 'time', 'actually', 'deep', 'attatchment', 'woman', 'Kate', 'Miller', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'still', 'stellar', 'here', 'Phoebe', 'struggle', 'find', 'family', 'struggle', 'unpredictable', 'way', 'TO', 'Beach', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'who', 'believe', 'was', 'struggling', 'addiction', 'time', 'also', 'different', 'side', 'Chandler', 'once', 'committment', 'weary', 'Chandler', 'search', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'mentioned', 'Schwimmer', 'Aniston', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'real', 'season', 'steal', 'season', 'performances', 'episodes', 'dealing', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'breakup', 'last', 'six', 'episodes', 'so', 'are', 'not', 'best', 'Friends', 'collection', 'season', 'still', 'worth', 'hit', 'really', 'high', 'points']",Friends: Season 3

There are just too many episodes from this season that are not worth the effort (e.g., &quot;The One Where No One's Ready,&quot; &quot;The One with the Football&quot;).  Part of the problem is the Rachel and Ross relationship dominates things to the point where everybody else ends up in the background, amply illustrated by &quot;The One Without the Ski Trip.&quot;  Nobody else has a decent story arc, which is amply illustrated by the whole bit between Monica and Pete the millionaire.  Compare this with all the things they came up with for season four, and I can rest my case.Best Episodes of the Third Season: &quot;The One With Frank Jr.&quot; just for the &quot;freebie list&quot; (who did you put on your list?); &quot;The One With the Flashback&quot; where we learn what was happening with the gang right before the pilot episode; &quot;The One Where Ross &amp; Rachel Take a Break&quot; just for the cosmic irony that the one time Ross gets lucky with another woman is during the infamous &quot;break&quot; (which was Rachel's idea); &quot;The One with the Morning After&quot; just to watch the Ross frantically trying to keep the secret from Rachel before we get to the inevitable pain of the breakup; &quot;The One with the Hypnosis Tape&quot; where Chandler tries to quit smoking, unaware his tapes are geared towards women; &quot;The One with the Screamer&quot; for the guest appearance of Ben Stiller as Tommy, Rachel's new boyfriend who has a bit of a temper problem; and &quot;The One at the Beach,&quot; more for Phoebe's meeting with an old friend of her mother (Teri Garr) than the strip &quot;Happy Days&quot; board game, but then there is also Rachel tricking Ross's girlfriend Bonnie to shaving her head.Yes, part of what makes &quot;Friends&quot; work is the way all six have their characters down pat, but the series is at its best when there are story arcs that up the ante on their interactions.  Watching Ross and Rachel go down in flames is the defining story line of the third season, but there need to be more for this season to really click.  Besides, the Ross and Rachel thing was getting so old that it is no wonder that the Chandler-Joey-Kathy triangle the next year was so touching or that the Monica and Chandler relationship exploded and took over the series in season five.",4,Ross and Rachel on a break in the weakest &quot;Friends&quot; season,1072656000,"12 29, 2003",2003,2708,"['quot', 'Friends', 'Complete', 'Third', 'Season', 'quot', 'show', 'producers', 'committed', 'idea', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'apart', 'funnier', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'together', 'idea', 'justified', 'quot', 'One', 'where', 'Ross', 'amp', 'Rachel', 'take', 'Break.', 'quot', 'worked', 'can', 'make', 'argument', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'weakest', 'bunch', 'might', 'explain', 'why', 'season', 'four', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'not', 'effort', 'e.g.', 'quot', 'One', 'Where', 'One', 'Ready', 'quot', 'quot', 'One', 'Football', 'quot', 'Part', 'problem', 'Rachel', 'Ross', 'relationship', 'things', 'point', 'where', 'everybody', 'else', 'up', 'background', 'amply', 'illustrated', 'quot', 'One', 'Ski', 'Trip.', 'quot', 'Nobody', 'else', 'decent', 'story', 'arc', 'amply', 'illustrated', 'whole', 'bit', 'Monica', 'Pete', 'millionaire', 'Compare', 'things', 'came', 'up', 'season', 'four', 'can', 'rest', 'case.Best', 'Episodes', 'Third', 'Season', 'quot', 'One', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'quot', 'just', 'quot', 'freebie', 'list', 'quot', 'who', 'did', 'put', 'list', 'quot', 'One', 'Flashback', 'quot', 'where', 'learn', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'gang', 'right', 'pilot', 'episode', 'quot', 'One', 'Where', 'Ross', 'amp', 'Rachel', 'Take', 'Break', 'quot', 'just', 'cosmic', 'irony', 'one', 'time', 'Ross', 'lucky', 'woman', 'infamous', 'quot', 'quot', 'was', 'Rachel', 'idea', 'quot', 'One', 'Morning', 'quot', 'just', 'watch', 'Ross', 'frantically', 'trying', 'keep', 'secret', 'Rachel', 'get', 'inevitable', 'pain', 'breakup', 'quot', 'One', 'Hypnosis', 'Tape', 'quot', 'where', 'Chandler', 'quit', 'smoking', 'unaware', 'tapes', 'are', 'geared', 'towards', 'women', 'quot', 'One', 'Screamer', 'quot', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Tommy', 'Rachel', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'bit', 'temper', 'problem', 'quot', 'One', 'Beach', 'quot', 'more', 'Phoebe', 'meeting', 'old', 'friend', 'mother', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'strip', 'quot', 'Happy', 'Days', 'quot', 'board', 'game', 'then', 'also', 'Rachel', 'tricking', 'Ross', 'girlfriend', 'Bonnie', 'shaving', 'head.Yes', 'part', 'what', 'quot', 'Friends', 'quot', 'work', 'way', 'six', 'have', 'characters', 'down', 'pat', 'series', 'best', 'when', 'are', 'story', 'arcs', 'up', 'ante', 'interactions', 'Watching', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'go', 'down', 'flames', 'defining', 'story', 'line', 'third', 'season', 'there', 'need', 'be', 'more', 'season', 'really', 'click', 'Besides', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'thing', 'was', 'getting', 'so', 'old', 'wonder', 'Chandler-Joey-Kathy', 'triangle', 'next', 'year', 'was', 'so', 'touching', 'Monica', 'Chandler', 'relationship', 'exploded', 'took', 'over', 'series', 'season', 'five']",Friends: Season 3

I am surprised that you are reading this review, because such an action would suggest that you do not have it yet.  And if that is the case, why are you still reading this.  Go get it!  If you're still here (it's possible, I suppose) I will say that I, and many viewers can continue to care about these six fine individuals...sidenote:  now that they've got three seasons under their belt, can it be considered a trilogy.  Anyway, you are treated to an episode full of Star Wars references right out of the gate (how you take them in their context is up to you.)  We are finally treated to several episodes of Maggie Wheeler, whose character Janice is just as memorible as our favorite six.  Then there's Ross getting shot down by Isabella Rossellini...I kid you not.  There's a flashback episode that takes us back to when our favorite four and a half (Joey joins the group at that time and while Rachael is there, she obviously isn't a part of it yet) hung out at a bar (should have had some hangover-like flashbacks...might have been some interesting stories to tell there.  Rachael's fantasy at the end was certainly suggestive.)  And who can forget the racecar bed?  If all these references don't seem to add up, that just proves how great this show really is, because in the episodes, they do...they do all add up.

733849,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B0000844MI,P Magnum,"[7, 9]","The third season of Friends is most notable for the breakup of the Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) relationship that had been a large part of the first two seasons.  As with most TV shows, complacency is the quickest root to cancellation, so the instead of keeping the two together, they break them up.  During the course of the first half of the season Rachel leaves her job as a waitress and meets a good looking guy, Mark (Steven Eckholdt, who now stars on My Big Fat Greek Life), who helps get her a job a Bloomingdale's.  Ross is immediately jealous as he says to Rachel no guy helps a girl just out of the goodness of his heart.  Rachel thinks he is being ridiculous and Ross' impending jealousy puts a strain on their relationship.  The breaking point comes when Rachel tells Ross she has to cancel their anniversary plans because she has to work late, he shows at her office with a picnic style dinner.  Rachel is incensed and she says they should take a break. Ross goes to a party with Joey (Matt LeBlanc) &amp; Chandler (Matthew Perry) and ends up sleeping with Chloe (Angela Featherstone) a  girl who works at a copier store that both Joey and Chandler have the hots for.  Ross tries to hide the affair from Rachel, but eventually she finds out from Gunther (James Michael Tyler), which to an all-night fight that ends up with Rachel leaving Ross.  Ross explains his infidelity by saying ""we were on a break"", which would become a much repeated line that would surface in most subsequent seasons.  The rest of the season deals with the breakup until the season ending episode where the gang goes to the beach in search of Phoebe's (Lisa Kudrow) father and Ross finds out that Rachel still has feelings for him.  While the main plot line is the Ross-Rachel relationship, there are plenty of other great episodes including a flashback episode where we go back to a time set one year before the series began, the introduction of the duck &amp; chick into Chandler &amp; Joey's apartment, a hilarious Thanksgiving episode in which Monica's (Courtney Cox) and Ross' old sibling rivalry comes out in a touch football game, Ben Stiller has a great guest spot as a new boyfriend of Rachel's who screams at Ross and no one believes him about it, Chandler starts smoking again and an episode where he uses a hypnosis tape to help him quit, but it is geared towards women and an early season episode that shows the true greatness of the show  in which the entire episode is spent with Ross trying get everyone ready for an important banquet.  It shows the subtly and genius of the actors and writers to take such a simple plot and expand it out over the course of a half-hour with hilarious results.  Season three is bogged down a bit by the heaviness of the breakup and also a ridiculous plot line involving Monica and Pete (Jon Favreau).  Monica first meets Pete at a diner she is working at and doesn't think much of him, but she goes out with even though she's not all that interested.  It turns out that Pete is a software mogul who incredibly rich.  She dates him and when Monica thinks he's bought her a ring, it turns out he is going to fulfill his dream by entering the extremely violent Ultimate Fighting Championship.  The relationship doesn't really click at all from the start and the ridiculous fighting championship plot is not up the usual high standards of the show.  That being said, Season three is still first rate and continues to include excellent performances by all of the cast members.",5,Freinds Take A Break,1049241600,"04 2, 2003",2003,3532,"['third', 'season', 'Friends', 'most', 'notable', 'breakup', 'Ross', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Rachel', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'relationship', 'had', 'been', 'large', 'part', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'most', 'TV', 'shows', 'complacency', 'quickest', 'root', 'cancellation', 'instead', 'keeping', 'two', 'together', 'break', 'up', 'course', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'Rachel', 'job', 'waitress', 'good', 'looking', 'guy', 'Mark', 'Steven', 'Eckholdt', 'who', 'now', 'My', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Life', 'who', 'get', 'job', 'Bloomingdale', 'Ross', 'immediately', 'jealous', 'Rachel', 'guy', 'girl', 'just', 'goodness', 'heart', 'Rachel', 'being', 'ridiculous', 'Ross', 'impending', 'jealousy', 'strain', 'relationship', 'breaking', 'point', 'when', 'Rachel', 'Ross', 'cancel', 'anniversary', 'plans', 'work', 'late', 'office', 'picnic', 'style', 'dinner', 'Rachel', 'incensed', 'should', 'take', 'break', 'Ross', 'party', 'Joey', 'Matt', 'LeBlanc', 'amp', 'Chandler', 'Matthew', 'Perry', 'up', 'sleeping', 'Chloe', 'Angela', 'Featherstone', 'girl', 'who', 'copier', 'store', 'Joey', 'Chandler', 'have', 'hots', 'Ross', 'hide', 'affair', 'Rachel', 'eventually', 'out', 'Gunther', 'James', 'Michael', 'Tyler', 'all-night', 'fight', 'up', 'Rachel', 'leaving', 'Ross', 'Ross', 'infidelity', 'saying', 'were', 'break', 'would', 'become', 'much', 'repeated', 'line', 'would', 'surface', 'most', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'rest', 'season', 'deals', 'breakup', 'season', 'ending', 'episode', 'where', 'gang', 'beach', 'search', 'Phoebe', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'father', 'Ross', 'out', 'Rachel', 'still', 'feelings', 'main', 'plot', 'line', 'Ross-Rachel', 'relationship', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'great', 'episodes', 'including', 'flashback', 'episode', 'where', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'set', 'one', 'year', 'series', 'began', 'introduction', 'duck', 'amp', 'chick', 'Chandler', 'amp', 'Joey', 'apartment', 'hilarious', 'Thanksgiving', 'episode', 'Monica', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'Ross', 'old', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'out', 'touch', 'football', 'game', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'great', 'guest', 'spot', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'Rachel', 'who', 'Ross', 'one', 'Chandler', 'smoking', 'again', 'episode', 'where', 'hypnosis', 'tape', 'help', 'quit', 'geared', 'towards', 'women', 'early', 'season', 'episode', 'true', 'greatness', 'show', 'entire', 'episode', 'spent', 'Ross', 'trying', 'get', 'everyone', 'ready', 'important', 'banquet', 'subtly', 'genius', 'actors', 'writers', 'take', 'simple', 'plot', 'expand', 'out', 'course', 'half-hour', 'hilarious', 'results', 'Season', 'three', 'bogged', 'down', 'bit', 'heaviness', 'breakup', 'also', 'ridiculous', 'plot', 'line', 'involving', 'Monica', 'Pete', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Monica', 'first', 'meets', 'Pete', 'diner', 'working', ""n't"", 'think', 'much', 'out', 'even', 'not', 'interested', 'out', 'Pete', 'software', 'mogul', 'who', 'incredibly', 'rich', 'when', 'Monica', 'bought', 'ring', 'out', 'going', 'fulfill', 'dream', 'entering', 'extremely', 'violent', 'Ultimate', 'Fighting', 'Championship', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'really', 'click', 'start', 'ridiculous', 'fighting', 'championship', 'plot', 'not', 'usual', 'high', 'standards', 'show', 'being', 'said', 'Season', 'three', 'still', 'first', 'rate', 'include', 'excellent', 'performances', 'cast', 'members']",Friends: Season 3

One of the themes in the beginning of this season is Joey's hate for Janice, at one time he describes it by saying ""When she laughs...it's like I want to tear my arm off so I have something to throw at her"".Phoebe attempts to bond with her trailer trash half brother who thinks that she's a hooker at first.  Soon we get a flash back that takes us back to about 6 months before the Pilot of Season One.After all of that Joey catches Janice kissing the husband she's supposed to be divorcing, Joey is faced with the task of telling his best friend Chandler, then Chandler must, again, break up with her.This is when Rachel quits her job at Central Perk and meets Mark, a man who can get her a job at bloomingdale's.  Ross immediately assumes that Mark wants sex in exchange for the job and gets jelous.  Meanwhile Chandler is fooling around with Joey's sisters and forgetting which one.Ross and Rachel's one year anniversary arrives, but when Rachel is forced to work late Ross brings a picnic to her work.  Rachel gets frustrated and insists that they take a break, when inside she doesn't want to.  Ross ends up going out with Joey and Chandler but yerns for Rachel, he calls to try to make up with her, but when he hears Mark over the phone he assumes the worst (Mark was really just giving Rachel advice).  Ross, depressed and thinking that Rachel is having sex with Mark, sleeps with the Xerox lady.  When Ross finds out the truth that Rachel did not sleep with Mark, they get back together.  Ross tries to cover up the fact that he slept with somebody else but Rachel finds out.After a long fight they break up.It then picks up with a bitter Ross and Rachel, still made at each other.  This is when Joey and Chandler buy a Chick and a Duck and Rachel dates a screaming crazy man in an attempt to get Ross Jelous.  In ends at the beach where Phoebe has found her birth mother and Ross is torn to decide between Rachel (who wants to hook up with him again) and his current girlfriend Bonnie.

It's so much more than just a gang of attractive people going through contrived situations, spouting contrived lines. The writing, acting, direction are all of the highest quality, and that's why it was so popular, year after year after year. It was no promotion stunt that saw each of the stars on $1m an episode by the final season! It's unusual to find a show with 6 lead characters in which all 6 can actually take the lead. Usually, one or two of the characters are head and shoulders above the others, so everything has to revolve around them and when things don't, the show falls flat. Friends really bucks that rule. The dialogue is so sharp and the characters so well drawn that virtually any show, involving any storyline, around any character is a knockout success. Season 3 is one of my favourites. It's both touching and funny how Ross and Rachel finally get it together in season 2 after making viewers wait so long.

Not to put down any of the other series which i love (except for 7 sorry i just lost interest)but 3 is the best in every way.The whole series has good episodes one after the other and in the middle of it all it has the breakdown of the Ross and Rachel relationship which is brilliantly acted by both Schwimmer and Aniston. The comedy is at top form with all 5 friends involved throughout and all not taking too much of the spotlight.

But of course to fans this season will always be known as the season where Ross and Rachel broke up. It was just so memorable and indelible that it echoes to the succeeding episodes of the season.Standouts episode are The One the Morning After (one of my all time favorites, Aniston and Schwimmer were just moving in here, and also the other four friends provide great comic support. Friends at its best), TOW Monica and Richard are just friends (this has always been one of my favorites, all the three storylines were great, but my favorite is the book swap with Joey and Rachel, both were hilarious especially Le Blanc), Tow the giant Poking Device (Perry and Kudrow stole the show), TOW No one's Ready (this is one of those episodes where it just gets better and better as you watch it), Tow the Frank Jr., TOW the Jam (Cox own this episode, very true to her character), Tow the Flashbacks, Tow the screamer, Tow the Chick and the duck, TOW the Ultimate Fighting Champion and TOW the Beach.One of the things that I love about the show is that all six characters have their share of character highs and lows, nobody dominates and actually runs the show, instead once in a while one character emerge as the strongest, but most of the time their complementing each other thus cementing their ensemble as one of the most effective and powerful ever.Grade: A+",5,Friends Season 3: The Breakup Year,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,1463,"['one', 'time', 'favorite', 'seasons', 'Friends', 'love', 'whole', 'atmosphere', 'entire', 'season', 'course', 'fans', 'season', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'known', 'season', 'where', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'broke', 'up', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'memorable', 'indelible', 'succeeding', 'episodes', 'season.Standouts', 'are', 'One', 'Morning', 'one', 'time', 'favorites', 'Aniston', 'Schwimmer', 'were', 'just', 'moving', 'here', 'also', 'other', 'four', 'friends', 'provide', 'great', 'comic', 'support', 'Friends', 'best', 'TOW', 'Monica', 'Richard', 'are', 'just', 'friends', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorites', 'three', 'storylines', 'were', 'great', 'favorite', 'book', 'swap', 'Joey', 'Rachel', 'were', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'Le', 'Blanc', 'Tow', 'giant', 'Poking', 'Device', 'Perry', 'Kudrow', 'stole', 'show', 'TOW', 'No', 'one', 'Ready', 'one', 'episodes', 'where', 'just', 'better', 'better', 'watch', 'Tow', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'TOW', 'Jam', 'Cox', 'own', 'episode', 'very', 'true', 'character', 'Tow', 'Flashbacks', 'Tow', 'screamer', 'Tow', 'Chick', 'duck', 'TOW', 'Ultimate', 'Fighting', 'Champion', 'TOW', 'Beach.One', 'things', 'love', 'show', 'six', 'characters', 'have', 'share', 'character', 'highs', 'lows', 'nobody', 'dominates', 'actually', 'show', 'instead', 'once', 'while', 'one', 'character', 'emerge', 'strongest', 'most', 'time', 'complementing', 'other', 'thus', 'cementing', 'ensemble', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'powerful', 'ever.Grade', 'A+']",Friends: Season 3
