Anderson ""ann0314""","[1, 1]","I originally rented the VHS version and then loved it so much that I rented the DVD the following week and then bought it here at Amazon.com. The DVD version has about an extra hour of footage which most DVD enthusiasts will agree is the beauty of DVD. The movie is enchanting, engaging, and quite funny although not suitable for young audiences. I would say about 10 years old and up atleast. I will say that my 5 year old watched it and really enjoyed it but there were parts that he couldn't watch or hear that were really for more sdult ears. Both myself and my husband laughed at and enjoyed the various plot twists. My husband is a hard sell on anything he thinks may be a ""chick flick"" and was surprising happy with watching this movie not once but 6 times in a 2 week period. I don't want to say too much more because I don't want to take away from the experience, but I will say that it is definitly a most see for those who enjoy ""fantasy"" movies and want to get lost in another reality for a day.

The most prominent character (whether you like it or not) is Wolf, played by the obnoxious Scott Cohen. To be fair, Cohen does his best with what material he's got; with his unshaven wild-eyed demeanor and flowing coat, he actually makes a cool hero... when he's not snarling and muttering about bacon every two seconds.Kimberly Williams is bland at first, but eventually starts to grow on you. Particularly Worthy of note is Daniel Lapaine, playing dual roles as Prince Wendell and the dog. As the retriever trapped in Wendell's stolen body, he steals every scene.The effects budget is good -- for ten years ago -- and is accompanied by gorgeous, Irish-seeming outdoor scenery. (Where did they film this, anyway? It looks great). Story-wise, 10K takes a while to get going:  Things finally pick up when Kimberly & co. begin touring the Nine Kingdoms; my favorites are Little Lamb Village - run by a medieval analog of Paris Hilton - and a cheesy Las Vegas parody called Kissing Town.

Who could endure this many interactions with children's storybook characters?  Luckily, my wife sat me down and we began this lengthy process.  To say the least, I was impressed.  Directors David Carson and Herbert Wise did a spectacular job of bringing the magic and detail of fairy tales to the small screen.  Through the voyages of our three main heroes, we see so many of our childhood escapes.  Places where only our imagination took us before, we are guided through the images of modern television.Imagination is only part of this miraculous tale.  This film keeps with the modern idea of fairy tales with some very dark thematic elements.  The scenes with the Trolls and with Snow White were spellbinding.  You could literally get lost in this film and never want to escape.  John Larroquette and Kimberly Williams are decent in their roles (about average for television), but it is Scott Cohen as the Wolf that literally steals every scene.  He plays his part to the fullest extent.  Ed O'Neill and Rutger Hauer also contribute well to this story.Overall, this was a beautiful (if long) story that continually pushed the boundaries of a television mini-series.  I never knew where it was going to take me next or which fairy tale it would dive right into.  There was never a dull moment and it is a story that can be watched over and over again.

A modern woman from contemporary New York City still living with her father ends up on an adventure beyond her imagining when a gateway between her world and the strange and surreal world of the 9 kingdoms is opened. The 9 kingdoms is an alternate reality where the fairy tales are strangely true and wolves (werewolves actually) do seduce young women, princes are put under wicked spells and dark, deep secrets are hidden behind the villainous wicked queen. (I won't spoil it for you.)One character I love in particular in this is the neurotic Wolf. Wolf is a half-wolf (werewolf) and apparently a descendant of The Big Bad Wolf. Wolf becomes the love interest in the story.There are some amazing acting talents in this mini-series including Diane Weist in her very first villain role. It's shocking to see her out of the sugary sweet motherly role we're used to such as her role as Peg in Edward Scissorhands and the mother role in Lost Boys.Another thing I like is the beautiful yet full figured woman who played Snow White- the actress from the practice. The writers paid close attention to detail in remembering that the original Snow White story's protagonist was fair and plump and they didn't follow the modern trend of the sickly-thin conception of beauty.The fairy tales return to their roots with this mature- yet decent enough for people of all ages- fantasy.

While walking through Central Park, she rescues a dog, actually an enchanted prince in disguise, who has escaped from one of the nine fairytale kingdoms into our world through the magical auspices of a mirror. The requisite evil queen has sent trolls and a werewolf to re-capture the dog and thus the adventure begins with Virginia, her father, the dog Prince Wendell and Wolfy all going back to the nine kingdoms and then trying to find the magic mirror and their way home.All of the classic fairytales and fairytale characters are here, but they have been delightfully twisted for a modern audience. The character wolf is wonderful and funny. During his sojourn in our world he falls for Virginia and seeks therapy for this: ""I don't know if I want to love her or eat her!"" he wails to a stone-faced therapist.The 10th Kingdom is funny, moving and intricate and while others have complained that it drags, I have to disagree with that assessment. I was enchanted as I was meant to be. Appropriate viewing for the entire family as any off-color jokes are designed to be amusing to the adults and over the heads of any little ones. Recommended in its own rite and as a means of introducing children to the classic Grimm tales through further reading.

479983,AO80JEDFYS6MJ,6305818282,A. Reader,"[2, 2]","I stumbled across this miniseries when it was on television.  I was flipping channels and an image of a man being tried by a jury of sheep caught my attention--as I think it would for most people.  I then rented the short version from the video store, but discovered that I would need my own copy, so I ordered the full movie from the NBC store.  If you loved fairy tales as a child, this series is for you.  It answers the question, ""What happened next?"" What happened after Snow White married the prince?  What did the dwarves do after Snow White left them?The movie follows Virginia and Tony Lewis, who travel through a magic mirror to the Nine Kingdoms, where the Grimm Brothers fairy tales are all history, not fantasy.  Virginia and Tony must travel through many of the kingdoms in pursuit of the mirror before they can return home.  The spoofing of fairy tales is excellent, and the more familiar you are with fairy tales, the more you'll enjoy this series.  It can be dark and violent, like all fairy tales, so I wouldn't recommend it for young children.  Unlike fairy tales, there is plenty of humor to move the story along--an appearance by Ann Margaret as a 300-year old Cinderella who has apparently had magic surgery done, three bumbling trolls who believe Virginia to be a powerful witch because they return from the ""10th Kingdom"" (a.k.a. modern day New York) with a stereo that only seems to play ""Saturday Night Fever"" by ""the brothers Gibb,"" and a sheep-song singing contest which features a very suggestive ""Little Bo Peep"" song and a very rousing ""We Will Sheer You"" that Queen is probably not too thrilled about.It's simply delightful IF you are a fan of fairy tales.

479987,A3QVI57VT1VGRO,6305818282,"bensmomma ""bensmomma""","[12, 17]","The 10th Kingdom, so the summaries say, is a mini-series (now out on DVD) about a girl, Virginia, living in New York with her hapless janitor father, who passes through a magic mirror in Central Park and lands in the land of fairy tales, the Nine Kingdoms ruled by descendants of Snow White, Cinderella, and the like, and populated by lascivious wolves, trolls, swamp witches, and fairies.  A wicked witch escapes from prison and enchants Prince Wendell of the 4th Kingdom, putting his spirit into the body of a golden retriever, and the poor retriever's spirit into the body of Wendell.  Virginia, her dad, and Wolf (who has a thing for Virginia as though she were Red Riding Hood), must overcome the Witch and return Wendell to the throne.Since this series seemed a nice blend of adventure and fairy-story, I thought it would be a good family choice, but I was mistaken on two fronts.  First, the screenwriters seem genuinely confused about their audience - much of 10th Kingdom is way to goofy-silly for adults, and a truly surprising amount of it is quite INappropriate for kids.  For example, when Dad and Virginia get lost in the swamp witch's swamp, they eat some magic mushrooms, hallucinate, and think they are hearing Procol Harum's song ""Whiter Shade of Pale.""  I guess someone thought that would be a kind of hip cultural reference, but it was too goofy for this adult, and the hallucinogenic mushrooms took it out of the realm of children.But wait - it gets worse!  Turns out that the Wicked Witch was actually Virginia's MOTHER before she abandoned the family when Virginia was only 7.  Turns out (as the Dad says), ""I loved her so I married her even though she was sleeping around.""  Some fairy-tale marriage, eh? Turns out the big love scene between Virginia and the Wolf consist of him chasing her through the forest, felling her like prey, jumping her bones, and impregnating her with a little wolf (thus convincing her at last to marry him).  Worst of all, turns out the wicked witchmother left because she had tried to drown Virginia in the bathtub, a scene which actually appears on screen.  It's hard to imagine the child who wouldn't be a bit traumatized by this.  I can only assume that the screenwriter(s) had read Bettelheim's famous book, ""The Uses of Enchantment,"" which psychoanalyzes fairytales and deconstructs them as stories about the tortured psychosexual relations between parents and children.Fun up to a point, but kids should NOT watch it, and adults will find it a bit too silly for five stars.",4,Someone has read WAY  too much Bruno Bettelheim,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,2533,"['10th', 'Kingdom', 'summaries', 'say', 'mini-series', 'now', 'out', 'DVD', 'girl', 'Virginia', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'hapless', 'janitor', 'father', 'who', 'magic', 'mirror', 'Central', 'Park', 'land', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Nine', 'Kingdoms', 'ruled', 'descendants', 'Snow', 'White', 'Cinderella', 'like', 'populated', 'lascivious', 'wolves', 'trolls', 'swamp', 'witches', 'fairies', 'wicked', 'witch', 'escapes', 'prison', 'enchants', 'Prince', 'Wendell', '4th', 'Kingdom', 'putting', 'spirit', 'body', 'golden', 'retriever', 'poor', 'retriever', 'spirit', 'body', 'Wendell', 'Virginia', 'dad', 'Wolf', 'who', 'thing', 'Virginia', 'were', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'must', 'overcome', 'Witch', 'return', 'Wendell', 'throne.Since', 'series', 'seemed', 'nice', 'blend', 'adventure', 'fairy-story', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'family', 'choice', 'was', 'mistaken', 'two', 'fronts', 'First', 'screenwriters', 'seem', 'genuinely', 'confused', 'audience', 'much', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'way', 'goofy-silly', 'adults', 'truly', 'surprising', 'amount', 'quite', 'INappropriate', 'kids', 'example', 'when', 'Dad', 'Virginia', 'get', 'lost', 'swamp', 'witch', 'swamp', 'eat', 'magic', 'mushrooms', 'hallucinate', 'think', 'are', 'hearing', 'Procol', 'Harum', 'song', 'Whiter', 'Shade', 'Pale', 'guess', 'someone', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'kind', 'hip', 'cultural', 'reference', 'was', 'too', 'goofy', 'adult', 'hallucinogenic', 'mushrooms', 'took', 'realm', 'children.But', 'wait', 'worse', 'out', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'was', 'actually', 'Virginia', 'MOTHER', 'abandoned', 'family', 'when', 'Virginia', 'was', 'only', '7', 'out', 'Dad', 'loved', 'so', 'married', 'even', 'was', 'sleeping', 'around', 'fairy-tale', 'marriage', 'eh', 'out', 'big', 'love', 'scene', 'Virginia', 'Wolf', 'consist', 'chasing', 'forest', 'felling', 'prey', 'jumping', 'bones', 'impregnating', 'little', 'wolf', 'thus', 'convincing', 'last', 'marry', 'Worst', 'out', 'wicked', 'witchmother', 'left', 'had', 'tried', 'drown', 'Virginia', 'bathtub', 'scene', 'actually', 'screen', 'hard', 'imagine', 'child', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bit', 'traumatized', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'screenwriter', 's', 'had', 'read', 'Bettelheim', 'famous', 'book', 'Uses', 'Enchantment', 'fairytales', 'stories', 'tortured', 'psychosexual', 'relations', 'parents', 'children.Fun', 'up', 'point', 'kids', 'should', 'NOT', 'watch', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'bit', 'too', 'silly', 'five', 'stars']",The 10th Kingdom VHS

479990,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,6305818282,Brent Butler,"[1, 1]","I remembered liking the 10th Kingdom quite a lot when it aired on TV, but it had been 11 years since then, so I was a bit fuzzy on parts of the story line and what I particularly liked. I bought the DVD set quite some time ago, but had not watched it. Recently I discussed with my son if he thought our 11 year old grand daughter might enjoy it. He had also watched it when it originally aired, and so was familiar with it, and agreed that she might. We decided on an informal schedule of get-togethers, and the plan and the program have been a hit with the family (again in some cases).The 10th Kingdom was one of the last of the old style mega-mini-series ... before a mini series mostly became four hours of a story aired on two consecutive nights. We haven't even seen much of that type in a really long while. Evidently reality programming which airs multiple times a week has killed the mini-series, at least for the time being. It runs 10 hours, so its not one of your pop it in the player on a whim selections.Its story is interesting and funny, as a father and his grown daughter are drawn by unusual events into a fairy tale world filled with the descendants of names we're all familiar with. They fall into helping a prince, who has been turned into a dog, reclaim his rightful place, and in doing so they must match wits with an evil witch and her servants.John Larroquette (try typing THAT three times fast) provides much of the comedy as the greedy but good hearted father. Scott Cohen almost steals the show as the always hungry but good hearted werewolf. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is solid as the pretty daughter, often indignant at the actions of others around her, but possessing the good sense to keep everyone somewhat grounded and on course (yes, she's good hearted). Ed O'Neill isn't given a lot to work with as the Troll King, but his three children and their fascination for the BeeGees are VERY funny. Their conjecture and subsequent alibi for being trapped in an elevator could be laugh out loud funny for some. Daniel Lapaine as Prince Wendell see-saws between being the irritating spoiled price, and an engaging hero. Let's just say that similar to Hoffman in Tootsie, he is a better Prince as a dog than he is a Prince as a man. Rutger Hauer provides a seriously scary tone as the murderous Huntsman (not good hearted). Dianne Wiest is also seriously ominous as the Evil Queen (also not good hearted).Throughout most of the 10 hours, our trio of heroes journey through the fairy tale Kingdoms, encountering interesting and amusing situations which will all remind you directly and indirectly of elements of fairy tales by those such as the Grimm brothers or Hans Christian Anderson. This is one of those rare pieces of programming that is equally fun for adults and kids at the same time, while containing no content that parents will have to wince at and hope the kids missed.However, I don't recommend that you pay the full price listed as of the date of this review (more than seventy dollars ... I think listed by an ""Amazon Associate""). There are plenty of used copies to be had for MUCH less. I routinely buy used copies of DVDs and Blu-ray's, and I've never once had cause to regret the money saved.

479997,AB34G6VKP28L,6305818282,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[2, 2]","From talking mirrors to magic beans, werewolves, wishing wells, and troll dust, The 10th Kingdom is an experience you'll never forget. With an all-star cast, incredible special effects by Artisan and a truly unique premise, this modern-day fairy tale will cast a spell over the entire family. It involves laughter, tears, many valuable lessons, and a shocking plot twist. This kind of modern blend between The Princess Bride and Snow White hasn't been successfully done until now... but Hallmark pulls it off with kid gloves.Perky, blue-eyed Virginia Lewis (Kimberly Williams) lives on the edge of Central Park within biking distance of her workplace, a half-rate diner where she spends most of her time. Her father Anthony (John Larroquette), once a successful businessman, is now an underpaid, overworked and often ill-treated janitor at their apartment building. The two share a boring existence, barely standing one another and desiring for a more exciting life. Virginia has resigned herself to the fact that this desire will never come true... but little does she know the adventure that is about to envelope them all in mystery, magic, and danger. The 9 Kingdoms have lived in peace since the imprisonment of the Evil Queen, Prince Wendell White's stepmother. But with the young and selfish prince's coronation forthcoming, he has been asked to make the rounds of his province, including a routine visit to the prison. The Queen (Dianne Wiest) has awaited this moment and formulates a daring plan with the aid of the Troll King.Wendell's manservant is murdered and the prince himself is imprisoned in the body of a dog, stripped of his rights and his voice. In his place, the Queen places an imposter... her doggy friend (Daniel Lapaine). But her plans go terribly wrong when the dog manages to escape into the cellars, and from there through a magic mirror into modern-day New York. After him she sends Burley, Blabberwort, and Bluebell, along with one of the prison inmates, a werewolf imprisoned for 'sheep worrying' (played by Scott Cohen). Prince leaps out of the mirror into the Park at the precise moment Virginia speeds by on her bike. There is a violent collision and she takes the dog with her to work, little knowing a pack of strange magical creatures will soon be on her trail. After that point, strange things begin to happen to Virginia... from a dog that seems to want to tell her something to three trolls who invade her home, terrorize her father, and steal her shoes, and even to a insane guy who breaks into her grandma's apartment and tries to cook her.Through a series of comical and unexplainable events, Virginia, Tony, and Prince are forced to flee through the mirror and into the 9 Kingdoms where nothing is as it seems... talking mushrooms, wishing wells, invisibility shoes, poisoned apples, talking birds, evil huntsmen, and fairy-tale creatures run rampant, from a 200-year-old Cinderella to the Tooth Fairy. The story is alive with myth, humor, and surprisingly two-dimensional characters while packing every gag, fairy tale character, and pun ever invented into a hilariously amusing story with a surprisingly dynamic climax. If you can't see the humor in the werewolves, elves, fairies, trolls, dwarves and blind woodsmen that traipse across the screen, you won't understand the messages that the film also has to offer about family, friendship, loving compassion, and forgiveness.The production is a captivating and highly entertaining saga of mystery, magic, and romance that actually leaves you with something to think about. Hidden beneath the silliness are true lessons about learning to trust yourself and others, forgiveness, not fleeing from your problems, and being courageous even when the stakes are down.

Vegan,"[1, 1]","I find this compared toOnce Upon a Time: The Complete First Season [Blu-ray] a lot, and to a certain point I agree, though it's more of, if you like that, you'll like this, since Once Upon a Time has the fantasy separated from reality, and the 10th Kingdom takes modern day Americans and throws them into Fantasyland.The cast is phenomenal, and the heroes are extremely likable, and the villains you love to hate.

It's about a young waitress who never thinks that anything interesting will ever happen in her life...little did she know that her life was about to change as she knew it.  She enters a magical fairy tale world, and she must learn to adapt to it because she and her father are stuck there until they can figure out a way to get home again.  Along the way they meet a friendly half wolf half human friend, lovingly named Wolf.I have watched this many, many times.  The story is excellent, the action is great, holds you on the edge of your seat, and the acting is just brilliant.  This is one of Scott Cohen's first big acting jobs, but you can't tell!  He plays the part of Wolf and is just wonderful.  This is what got his career kicked up, and you can see why!I loved the characters in this movie, they were all just so great.  And the relationship between Wolf and Virginia is just excellently put together!It was made as a mini-series, and because of this fact, I thought that the movie quality, the acting, and all in all the entire film would be poor...but boy was I wrong!  I fell in love with it the first time I ever saw it, and have even become a bit obsessed with it!I must admit, though, that the first few minutes of the film are kind of slow.  It doesn't start to get really good until around the time that the character ""Wolf"" is introduced.  But, the rest of the movie completely makes up for this slower beginning.This is truly one of the greatest fairy tale stories out there.

As an adult fantasy/sci-fi buff, I'm at a loss to what anyone else would like about this disturbing film.I can simply sum up my feelings by one pivotal scene where a single man commits a brutal act of mass murder to three generations of an entire family. Here we are graphically shown the  murder by magical bow & arrow of every man, women and child totaling over a dozen people. What warranted their death sentence? The crime of poaching! Who were these people? A caravan of Rom, better known as Gypsies. Forget the racist stereotypes of an ethnic group that was targeted for elimination during WW 2, for a moment. Here's a group of people whose only crime is trying to survive in a rather hostile environment. Sure their ethics are far from perfect. But did we need to view an act of mass murder to make a point? Seeing an entire family, including a child, brutally murdered is not my idea of a good time!To add insult to injury, this mass murderer is also a kidnapper and it doesn't take much imagination to conclude, a rapist to boot!I'm very disappointed Hallmark would lend its name to such rotten trash! What does this teach our children?

What would happen if you took all of the major fairy tales (Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Jack and the Beanstalk, Peter Pan, etc), threw in an archaic fable (King Midas), added fables of Wishing Wells and Valentines Day, sprinkled in a little bit of The Lord of The Rings and then put them all in a blender?  Well, the present film answers that question.  You would end up in a fairy-tale world where everything is mystical and magic is as common as springtime rain.The story will take some patience on the part of the viewer as it is very drawn out.  The pacing of it is pretty decent for the most part, however.  One of the most interesting facets is how it takes the viewer through many enchanted realms that represent different fairy tales.  The motifs of all the various fairy tales are almost certain to be depicted at some point along the way.The acting of the film is of a high calibre.  Rutger Haur is a perfect fit as the huntsman while Scott Cohen delivers a considerable performance as a half-wolf.  However, the primary reason to pick up this DVD is Kimberly Williams.  In a word, she is simply adorable as a cross between the girl-next-door and a fairy tale princess.  I've seen her in a few other films and have always been impressed with her charming screen presence.For a HALLMARK movie, the film has a surprising amount of sexual innuendo.  Most of it will not be picked up by children, but it was nonetheless a bit unexpected.  Of course, in a way it is fitting for the film to have it as so many fairy tales deal with sexual coming-of-age (Snow White especially).So, if you still have some kid left in you (and I do hope that is the case!) this DVD will be an elegant addition to your collection.

Although the trolls are ridiculous and stupid, they are still funny.  And maybe the Witch and the Wolf are the only completely convincing actors, but everyone else is above mediocre.  An excellent film overall. Quite enchanting.I was a bit disappointed at the sexual content at the end. Wolf and Virginia have a little romp in the grass, which shows nothing and probably goes over children's heads, but you're going to have to explain why she has a baby in her tummy at the end. I would have been more impressed with the movie if it could have stayed moral to the end in true fairy-tale style. And when you first see the ending with Virginia and Wolf it says they do not live happily ever after and that upset me, but if you listen carefully it's essentially just saying that tragedies and trials come, but they're still together.I especially loved the scene where you hear the song Lighter Shade of Pale and they eat the mushrooms, extremely entertaining, and any drug insinuations are not apparent to children.

480018,AOTMP0OKJOUWI,6305818282,"Emily J. Morris ""Backroads""","[2, 3]","Years and years after this came on tv, I am still in love with this movie.  This is what mini-series are meant to be. Heck, this is what good story-telling is meant to be, I don't care about the medium.  Sure, it's lengthy, but if you are a simpleton with a short attention span it is your own problem.  Length is what this story needed to make its full impact. If they had needed more time, by all means, I would have not complained.This is a show made for the people who love fairy tales (not that the layman wouldn't fall in love with the 9 Kingdoms).  There are jokes and allusions that go surprising beyond your basic Cinderella and Snow White.  I have laughed at the various intricacies that too-well show the nature of fairy tales.The plot is based on fairy tales. Without fairy tales, this movie would not exist, along with so much of our modern culture. What so many people fail to realize is how imbedded into soceity fairy tale and their eternal themes are.  The story itself is a fairy tale, the tale of a servant girl (actually, she's a waitress in Central Park, but close enough) who goes on a journey to a magical world in the attendance of several quirky companions, meets various adventure, and ultimately becomes something more than a ""just a waitress"".  It's a classic fairy tale plot, and it is one that will never die.  It is a story that is timeless.  Not only is the story a fairy tale itself, it's gosh-darn chuck-full of fairy tales, albeit a wild and thoroughly entertaining blend.The 10th kingdom is actually our world, but the other nine exist in a parallel world oddly similar to Europe (the source of many well-known tales and certainly those brought screaming and kicking into the show).  This is the world where fairy tales are real and a part of life.  Most attention is on the 4th kingdom, but the DVD happily provides intricate information on the others until quite the little culture is developed.At first glance, it seems that the fairy tales are wickedly mocked, but closer insight shows a touching respect for all of them. So what is wrong with having a little fun?The main fairy tale is that of Snow White. A major character, Prince Wendell, is the grandson of Snow White.  The woman herself is shown, in an incredible theme that goes beyond the traditional, weakened, damsel-in-distress Snow White.  It's truly powerful and heart-felt what this plot line shows.Beyond the story, there lies the characters.  Wow.  How can you not fall in love with this ragged, weird, and terribly quirky band of characters?  Characters drive this plot with every odd personality flaw available to them.  Their complexity is certainly admirable.  The best part is how 2-dimensional they originally seemed.  Just a bunch of fun goofballs. But as the show progresses, more and more is revealed about each of them until they are entirely human (or wolf, or whatever).  The perfect actors were chosen for each character, and I cannot imagine anyone but them playing their parts.  Applause to all of them for an incredible thespian job!The DVD itself is also very respectable. I mentioned the info on the other kingdoms.  There is also character and actor information.  The making of- feature was delightful, and heck, even the menus rock.This is truly a treasure, and I hope more people learn to recognize it as such.",5,The ultimate fairy tale.,1168214400,"01 8, 2007",2007,3336,"['Years', 'years', 'came', 'tv', 'am', 'still', 'love', 'movie', 'what', 'mini-series', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'Heck', 'what', 'good', 'story-telling', 'meant', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'medium', 'Sure', 'lengthy', 'are', 'simpleton', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'own', 'problem', 'Length', 'what', 'story', 'needed', 'make', 'full', 'impact', 'had', 'needed', 'more', 'time', 'means', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'complained.This', 'show', 'made', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'fairy', 'tales', 'not', 'layman', 'would', ""n't"", 'fall', 'love', '9', 'Kingdoms', 'are', 'jokes', 'allusions', 'go', 'surprising', 'basic', 'Cinderella', 'Snow', 'White', 'have', 'laughed', 'various', 'intricacies', 'too-well', 'show', 'nature', 'fairy', 'tales.The', 'plot', 'based', 'fairy', 'tales', 'fairy', 'tales', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'exist', 'so', 'much', 'modern', 'culture', 'What', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'fail', 'realize', 'how', 'imbedded', 'soceity', 'fairy', 'tale', 'eternal', 'themes', 'are', 'story', 'fairy', 'tale', 'tale', 'servant', 'girl', 'actually', 'waitress', 'Central', 'Park', 'close', 'enough', 'who', 'journey', 'magical', 'world', 'attendance', 'several', 'quirky', 'companions', 'meets', 'various', 'adventure', 'ultimately', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'waitress', 'classic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'plot', 'one', 'will', 'never', 'die', 'story', 'timeless', 'Not', 'only', 'story', 'fairy', 'tale', 'gosh-darn', 'chuck-full', 'fairy', 'tales', 'wild', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'blend.The', '10th', 'kingdom', 'actually', 'world', 'other', 'nine', 'exist', 'parallel', 'world', 'oddly', 'similar', 'Europe', 'source', 'many', 'well-known', 'tales', 'certainly', 'brought', 'screaming', 'kicking', 'show', 'world', 'where', 'fairy', 'tales', 'are', 'real', 'part', 'life', 'Most', 'attention', '4th', 'kingdom', 'DVD', 'happily', 'intricate', 'information', 'others', 'little', 'culture', 'developed.At', 'first', 'glance', 'fairy', 'tales', 'are', 'wickedly', 'mocked', 'closer', 'insight', 'touching', 'respect', 'So', 'what', 'wrong', 'having', 'little', 'fun', 'main', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Snow', 'White', 'major', 'character', 'Prince', 'Wendell', 'grandson', 'Snow', 'White', 'woman', 'shown', 'incredible', 'theme', 'traditional', 'weakened', 'damsel-in-distress', 'Snow', 'White', 'truly', 'powerful', 'heart-felt', 'what', 'plot', 'line', 'shows.Beyond', 'story', 'characters', 'Wow', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'ragged', 'weird', 'terribly', 'quirky', 'band', 'characters', 'Characters', 'drive', 'plot', 'odd', 'personality', 'flaw', 'available', 'complexity', 'certainly', 'admirable', 'best', 'part', 'how', '2-dimensional', 'originally', 'seemed', 'Just', 'bunch', 'fun', 'goofballs', 'show', 'more', 'more', 'revealed', 'are', 'entirely', 'human', 'wolf', 'perfect', 'actors', 'were', 'chosen', 'character', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'playing', 'parts', 'Applause', 'incredible', 'thespian', 'job', 'DVD', 'also', 'very', 'respectable', 'mentioned', 'info', 'other', 'kingdoms', 'also', 'character', 'actor', 'information', 'making', 'of-', 'feature', 'was', 'delightful', 'heck', 'even', 'menus', 'rock.This', 'truly', 'treasure', 'hope', 'more', 'people', 'learn', 'recognize', 'such']",The 10th Kingdom VHS

This series is so bad as to be almost unwatchable...in fact, it is unwatchable. I forced myself to sit through it, since I shelled out considerable cash for it in high hopes that it would be the awe-inspiring series mentioned on the back and in reviews.The problem seems to lie in that the film couldn't decide whether the main audience should be adults or children, and consequently fails miserably to reach either. All of a child's favorite fairy-tale characters are included, which would be fine, but the story had to be ""modernised"", apparently on the presumption that today's ""hip"" kids wouldnt appreciate it and that adults would get bored (it is about 10 hours, after all). So, to spice things up, the writers added gratiuitous sexual innuendo and profanity (like the pathetic ""butt"" kissing episode, but the word used wasn't butt, and I cannot repeat it here since Amazon.com wouldn't allow it and deleted my last review for content...ask yourself if you want your kids watching a film with language Amazon.com won't allow in a review!). How to pick up chicks and pop psychology are thrown in, apparently to amuse the adult audience, but the whole thing just seems grossly patronising and you actually feel a bit insulted and offended while watching. The story line is moronic, and the interplay between the evil queen and her daughter would be deeply disturbing to some children (in short, you are a burden to your parents, and they would do anything, including murder, to get rid of you). The acting is so bad you feel uncomfortable watching it...three notable examples are the babbling, neurotic ""wolf"", the three ""hip"" maniacal troll children and Laroquette's character, who tries and fails to convey that he takes this whole romp seriously. you actually feel sorry for all of the actors in this series, and hope that the poor acting is a result of an irredeemable script and not lack of talent. There are some cute moments, like an obese Snow White (the fairest in the land?) and a geriatric Cinderella (or Sleeping Beauty, I forget) whose youthful face belies bone cracking agony whenever she is invited to dance. All in all, adults will find this film completely unwatchable, and kids will find it weird, incomprehensible or just boring, perhaps a healthy dose of all three.The sad fact is there was SO much potential here, and the special effects really are spectacular (the opening sequence in particular), and the series' failure to deliver just leaves one angry and wanting to mash the tapes into tiny, little bits, especially after ten hours of hoping that it will somehow get better.See ""Arabian Nights"" with Leguizamo and others. It tackles the same theme and manages to deliver with much more humor and entertainment in 1/5 the time.",1,Was I watching the same film as the rest of these folks?,1089331200,"07 9, 2004",2004,2904,"['write', 'wonder', 'possible', 'were', 'two', 'entirely', 'separate', '10th', 'Kingdoms', 'released', 'just', 'bought', 'evil', 'twin', 'version', 'series', 'so', 'bad', 'be', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'fact', 'unwatchable', 'forced', 'sit', 'shelled', 'out', 'considerable', 'cash', 'high', 'hopes', 'would', 'be', 'awe-inspiring', 'series', 'mentioned', 'back', 'reviews.The', 'problem', 'lie', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'main', 'audience', 'should', 'be', 'adults', 'children', 'consequently', 'miserably', 'reach', 'child', 'favorite', 'fairy-tale', 'characters', 'are', 'included', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'story', 'had', 'be', 'modernised', 'apparently', 'presumption', 'today', 'hip', 'kids', 'wouldnt', 'appreciate', 'adults', 'would', 'get', 'bored', '10', 'hours', 'So', 'spice', 'things', 'up', 'writers', 'added', 'gratiuitous', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'profanity', 'pathetic', 'butt', 'kissing', 'episode', 'word', 'used', 'was', ""n't"", 'butt', 'can', 'not', 'repeat', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'would', ""n't"", 'allow', 'deleted', 'last', 'review', 'content', 'ask', 'want', 'kids', 'watching', 'film', 'language', 'Amazon.com', 'wo', ""n't"", 'allow', 'review', 'How', 'pick', 'up', 'chicks', 'pop', 'psychology', 'are', 'thrown', 'apparently', 'amuse', 'adult', 'audience', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'grossly', 'patronising', 'actually', 'feel', 'bit', 'insulted', 'offended', 'watching', 'story', 'line', 'moronic', 'interplay', 'evil', 'queen', 'daughter', 'would', 'be', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'children', 'short', 'are', 'burden', 'parents', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'including', 'murder', 'get', 'rid', 'acting', 'so', 'bad', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'three', 'notable', 'examples', 'are', 'babbling', 'neurotic', 'wolf', 'three', 'hip', 'maniacal', 'troll', 'children', 'Laroquette', 'character', 'who', 'convey', 'whole', 'romp', 'seriously', 'actually', 'feel', 'sorry', 'actors', 'series', 'hope', 'poor', 'acting', 'result', 'irredeemable', 'script', 'not', 'lack', 'talent', 'are', 'cute', 'moments', 'obese', 'Snow', 'White', 'fairest', 'land', 'geriatric', 'Cinderella', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'forget', 'youthful', 'face', 'belies', 'bone', 'cracking', 'agony', 'whenever', 'invited', 'dance', 'adults', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'completely', 'unwatchable', 'kids', 'will', 'find', 'weird', 'incomprehensible', 'just', 'boring', 'perhaps', 'healthy', 'dose', 'three.The', 'sad', 'fact', 'was', 'SO', 'much', 'potential', 'here', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'are', 'spectacular', 'opening', 'sequence', 'particular', 'series', 'failure', 'deliver', 'just', 'one', 'angry', 'wanting', 'mash', 'tapes', 'tiny', 'little', 'bits', 'especially', 'ten', 'hours', 'hoping', 'will', 'somehow', 'get', 'better.See', 'Arabian', 'Nights', 'Leguizamo', 'others', 'same', 'theme', 'manages', 'deliver', 'much', 'more', 'humor', 'entertainment', '1/5', 'time']",The 10th Kingdom VHS

It may be seven hours (417 minutes) long, but it never getsdull. It's fantastic, over the top, and even silly at times, but ifyou have a taste for fairy tales, this is not to be missed. ScottCohen does an incredible job of portraying Wolf, as does DanielLapaine as the dog turned prince (and the dog plays well, too), andall the other actors do a very memorable job. And of course it neverhurts to have a cute leading lady such as Kimberly Williams :) Thetransformation of New York to a fantasy kingdom in the opening titlesis one of the most incredible scenes I've ever seen.I've hadproblems playing this DVD smoothly on my computer, even whenoverclocking my Celeron 300A to 450MHz, and coupled with an ATIXPERT@Play 98, which supports motion compensation. This is certainlythe most demanding DVD I've ever played. It does pay you back withvery good image quality. Sound is only 2.0 Dolby Surround (which isfine by me, since I only have stereo speakers). My sound system isn'tthat good, so I can't really comment on the quality of the sound, butit was clear enough for me.The movie comes on 3 DVDsides. &quot;Disc A&quot; includes 166 minutes plus the specialfeatures - a &quot;making of&quot; featurette, which also includes acouple of bloopers, and textual features about the actors, charactersand the 9 kingdoms. &quot;Disc B&quot; (the other side of A) says itcontains 84 minutes, and &quot;Disc C&quot; 167 minutes. However, Ithink that these figures must be switched. Haven't really measured thetimes, but I think that C was shorter than 2.5 hours, and it certainlycontains less data than B, when viewed in Windows.I thought that itwould have been better to split the DVDs such that the movie is onjust two sides, and leave the special features on the 2nd DVD, ifnecessary (although I don't think it's necessary). This is not a majorcomplaint, however, as you're not likely to see this movie in onesitting, anyway, and I guess that it makes some sense to break it into83 minute episodes (which may be the way it was originallyaired).My biggest complaint is the lack of subtitles. The movie isclosed captioned, but I much prefer subtitles. For one thing, my DVDplayer doesn't support closed captioning. The other thing is thatsubtitles look better. Since the text is available, it shouldn't havebeen too much of a problem to add subtitles. I find subtitles veryhelpful in understanding what the actors are saying.

The effects were cool, granted, and on a very superficial level, it would have been an enjoyable film.  But there were just too many STUPID STUPID things... like the CGI hearts in one scene (sooooo tacky), the trolls singing along to disco music and their very 3-stooges interaction, the terrible overuse of slapstick, the horrible &quot;We will rock you&quot; meets &quot;Miss America&quot; meets Dark Ages set design... oh, it was just too much.  I sat through the whole thing, expecting -- no, hoping desperately -- that it would get better, but at the end, I felt only that I had lost 6.5 hours of my life I'd never get back.  I think the real capper was a scene filmed somewhere in picturesque mountains... and they didn't bother to edit out the POWER LINES.If you think the Three Stooges, Looney Toons, and game shows are High Art, then this is a film for you.

480029,A6DH4F9ACJ62F,6305818282,J. Berry,"[5, 7]","The 10th Kingdom is easily the best fantasy mini series I've seen for a long time. It might seem like an old and tired formula: people from our world are taken to another one to help stop a disaster, but this is handled  so well the whole thing is reinvented.We have the heroine, Virginia, a  New York waitress who lives with her father and longs for something to  happen when she hits a dog in Central Park who isn't really a dog at all.  We have her father, Tony, who is approached by Wolf - supposed minion of  the queen who falls in love with Virginia - and given six wishes, all of  which he uses to great comic effect. And this, you realise, is only the  first episode set in New York.The 10th Kingdom is stuffed full of faery  tale elements which help to keep the story going along and interesting:  trails of breadcrumbs, magic mirrors, dwarves, dragons, a Midas touch,  poisoned apples, evil queens, bad luck and wishes, princesses and quests.  It's the story of Virginia and Tony's struggle to get back to New York,  woven in with Wolf's pining for Virginia, the plottings of the Queen for  Wendel's kingdom and half a dozen little subplots and ideas woven in. Just  when you think the story's getting stale, something else bursts out and  livens everything up.This is a brilliant series with a snappy script and  special effects which add to the story rather than becoming it. The  characters are interesting and fun, and the dialogue is hilarious. This is  well worth buying if you're at all interested in fantasy, but despite the  subject matter some of the scenes may not be suited to fairly young  children.",5,"Truly - um, enchanting",957052800,"04 30, 2000",2000,1622,"['10th', 'Kingdom', 'easily', 'best', 'fantasy', 'mini', 'series', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'might', 'seem', 'old', 'tired', 'formula', 'people', 'world', 'are', 'taken', 'one', 'help', 'stop', 'disaster', 'handled', 'so', 'well', 'whole', 'thing', 'reinvented.We', 'have', 'heroine', 'Virginia', 'New', 'York', 'waitress', 'who', 'father', 'longs', 'something', 'happen', 'when', 'dog', 'Central', 'Park', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'dog', 'have', 'father', 'Tony', 'who', 'approached', 'Wolf', 'supposed', 'minion', 'queen', 'who', 'love', 'Virginia', 'given', 'six', 'wishes', 'great', 'comic', 'effect', 'realise', 'only', 'first', 'episode', 'set', 'New', 'York.The', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'stuffed', 'full', 'faery', 'tale', 'elements', 'help', 'keep', 'story', 'going', 'along', 'interesting', 'trails', 'breadcrumbs', 'magic', 'mirrors', 'dwarves', 'dragons', 'Midas', 'touch', 'poisoned', 'apples', 'evil', 'queens', 'bad', 'luck', 'wishes', 'princesses', 'quests', 'story', 'Virginia', 'Tony', 'struggle', 'get', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'woven', 'Wolf', 'pining', 'Virginia', 'plottings', 'Queen', 'Wendel', 'kingdom', 'dozen', 'little', 'subplots', 'ideas', 'woven', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'story', 'getting', 'stale', 'something', 'else', 'out', 'everything', 'up.This', 'brilliant', 'series', 'snappy', 'script', 'special', 'effects', 'add', 'story', 'rather', 'becoming', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'fun', 'dialogue', 'hilarious', 'well', 'worth', 'buying', ""'re"", 'interested', 'fantasy', 'subject', 'matter', 'scenes', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suited', 'fairly', 'young', 'children']",The 10th Kingdom VHS

Absolutely nothing -- this is a totally engaging and wonderful tale.From the hilarious predicament brought on by the magical dragon dung wishing bean, to discovering an escape clue in a dungeon written by one of the Grimm Brothers, to the heart-wrenching gift of Snow White's rosebud, this movie is a constant delight for lovers of fairytales and for those who still want to believe that no trollish trial, sorcerous snare or mortal misjudgement exists that can't lead an unlikely hero -- or heroine -- to a &quot;happily ever after.&quot;  With a little luck, that is, and a helping hand from some unlikely friends.  Like a repentant &quot;wolf&quot; who must frequently fight his urge to eat toothsome children or shepherdesses.  Or a pampered prince who learns how to be a king thanks to a spell that turns him into a golden retriever.It is perhaps not surprising that this film was more popular in Great Britain than in some other locales.  It's witty without being boringly slapstick, whimsical without being maudlin, mature without being embarassingly crude, wise without being conceited or preachy.  Like the old fairy tales, it offers levels of appreciation and enjoyment that go beyond the instant gratification of seat-shaking special effects or in-your-face social moralising.  This film, little spoken of and available at an incredibly low price, is in my opinion a genuine &quot;Sleeping Beauty.&quot;  If you love fairy tales, I suspect you'll find yourself enthralled with this &quot;continuation&quot; of the old stories.  Consider doing yourself the favour -- you'll be as safe with this one as you would be in a &quot;uh...uh... a brick pig house.&quot;&quot;Ratings&quot; Caveat:  There are two or three examples of mildly &quot;grown-up&quot; language and situations in the course of the film.

Imagine Grimm's Fairy Tales, 200 years on and everything is not Happy Ever After anymore.Virginia and her father, Tony, (from New York) pass  through a magic mirror to aid Prince Wendall, who's been turned into a dog  by an evil Queen.  They are joined and guided on their journey by Wolf who  is half-man, half-wolf.  Initially controlled by the Queen, Wolf changes  his alliance when he's meets Virginia and falls in love with her.The  adventure is fantastic, along with the effects.  Each character is  carefully drawn and essentially the movie is about each of them finding  themselves and then each other.Virginia starts out cold and in tight  control of her emotions, resenting that her mother left her when she was  young. Wolf eventually manages to break through her defence with his  passion and enjoyment of life.Tony starts out a whining coward but ends  up a hero.Prince Wendall starts out spoilt and a snob but by the time  he's restored to human form, he's a wiser man.And Wolf, well, he's a  tortured soul that wants to be good and due to his love for Virginia he  finally manages to overcome his wolfish side - although, thankfully, not  totally!To explain Wolf's dilema it's easier to quote him. While talking  to a therapist about Virginia he says: &quot;I've met a girl that I really,  really like but I don't know whether I want to love her or eat  her.&quot;Scott Cohen who plays Wolf definitely steals every scene he's  in but having said that, the other actors are excellent too and they all  work well together.Lastly, I just wanted to mention Rutger Hauer who  plays the Huntsman.  It's another great baddie role for him and he is just  wonderful - he has such quiet menace!Watch it - it may be long but  you'll be 'wishing on a star' to see it again and again!",5,A Howling Success!,957398400,"05 4, 2000",2000,1861,"['little', 'slow', 'start', 'miniseries', 'soon', 'captivated', 'Imagine', 'Grimm', 'Fairy', 'Tales', '200', 'years', 'everything', 'not', 'Happy', 'Ever', 'anymore.Virginia', 'father', 'Tony', 'New', 'York', 'pass', 'magic', 'mirror', 'aid', 'Prince', 'Wendall', 'who', 'been', 'turned', 'dog', 'evil', 'Queen', 'are', 'joined', 'guided', 'journey', 'Wolf', 'who', 'half-man', 'half-wolf', 'Initially', 'controlled', 'Queen', 'Wolf', 'alliance', 'when', 'meets', 'Virginia', 'love', 'her.The', 'adventure', 'fantastic', 'effects', 'character', 'carefully', 'drawn', 'essentially', 'movie', 'finding', 'then', 'other.Virginia', 'out', 'cold', 'tight', 'control', 'emotions', 'resenting', 'mother', 'left', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'Wolf', 'eventually', 'break', 'defence', 'passion', 'enjoyment', 'life.Tony', 'out', 'whining', 'coward', 'up', 'hero.Prince', 'Wendall', 'out', 'spoilt', 'snob', 'time', 'restored', 'human', 'form', 'wiser', 'man.And', 'Wolf', 'well', 'tortured', 'soul', 'be', 'good', 'due', 'love', 'Virginia', 'finally', 'overcome', 'wolfish', 'side', 'thankfully', 'not', 'totally', 'explain', 'Wolf', 'dilema', 'easier', 'quote', 'talking', 'therapist', 'Virginia', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'met', 'girl', 'really', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'want', 'love', 'eat', 'her.', 'quot', 'Scott', 'Cohen', 'who', 'Wolf', 'definitely', 'scene', 'having', 'said', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'too', 'work', 'well', 'together.Lastly', 'just', 'wanted', 'mention', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'who', 'Huntsman', 'great', 'baddie', 'role', 'just', 'wonderful', 'such', 'quiet', 'menace', 'Watch', 'may', 'be', 'long', ""'ll"", 'be', ""'wishing"", 'star', 'see', 'again', 'again']",The 10th Kingdom VHS

I did laugh, and I myself liked the sexual innuendoes.  But the silliness was a bit much.  Each night I watched, my husband would give it a half hour before he gave up, rolling his eyes, and went to bed to read.  And the special effects were cheesy for the most part, but this didn't bother me.The story was about the young (maybe early twenties) Virginia and her father being transported by a magical mirror into a fairy tale dimension.  And the movie is about their many adventures during their quest to find the mirror to transport them back to Manhattan, which happens to be the 10th Kingdom.  They are accompanied in their quest, for most but not all of the way, by Wolf (a man who is really a werewolf and has a huge crush on Virginia) and and also by the prince who has been changed into a dog by the evil queen.  Some of their adventures are quite entertaining and have humorous moments.My favorite character by far was Wolf.  I found his quirkiness funny and cute and the man himself was very hot.  I have to say if the actor who played Wolf wasn't so good-looking, I might not have kept up watching this very lengthy movie so diligently.  I guess there was no actress hot enough to keep my husband watching.My biggest complaint is the very end.  After watching such a very long movie, especially a fairy tale, I expect a complete happy ending.  Even Lord of the Rings, a much more complex and dramatic film (that truly shouldn't be compaired to this fluffy miniseries anyway), completed their trilogy with a happy ending.  Well, The 10th Kingdom gives us a happy ending, then tears it down with the last line (trust me, this won't ruin the movie for you, but may help take some of the disappointment away when you hear it after sooo many hours of viewing): ""I'd like to tell you we lived happily ever after, but we didn't for long because of more trouble in the Kingdoms soon to happen.  But live life and be complete, even if it's not a long life.  This was just my story and the first book in The 10 Kingdoms""  Huh??  After all these hours of watching, THIS is what I get??  After I was happy with the ending (although, I was already a bit disappointed in the direction it took at the very very ending), the voiceover throws in these lines to ruin it?  This is not an exact quote of the voiceover, but is close enough.  Well, after all that watching, I want a complete story without some voiceover coming in to ruin it by saying things don't last happy for long and there will be a sequel (which I'm confident there will never be).Despite these problems, it was an entertaining watch if you have time on your hands.  I am continuously disappointed with movies I rent, so purchasing this one for $10 with plenty of hours is a good buy.  I don't regret watching this silly fun miniseries, I just have to pretend I didn't see the last minute of it.  And I definitely enjoyed watching Wolf.  But unless you think this is up your alley, there are plenty of other movies and TV DVD sets that are much better.",3,"Entertaining, long, fluffy miniseries",1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,3698,"['have', 'say', 'reading', 'Amazon', 'review', 'first', 'review', 'listed', 'here', 'then', 'buying', 'based', 'high', 'rating', 'overall', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'was', 'expecting', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'silly', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'was', 'willing', 'watch', 'totally', 'different', ""'feel"", 'expected', ""n't"", 'take', 'very', 'seriously', 'silly', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'fairy', 'tales', 'complex', 'plots', 'reference', 'first', 'review', 'here', 'mentioned', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'sold', 'plot', 'so', 'simply', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'could', 'follow', 'yet', 'movie', 'not', 'children', 'adult', 'fairy', 'tale', 'what', 'wanted', 'one', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'silly', 'did', 'laugh', 'liked', 'sexual', 'innuendoes', 'silliness', 'was', 'bit', 'much', 'night', 'watched', 'husband', 'would', 'give', 'half', 'hour', 'gave', 'up', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'went', 'bed', 'read', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'cheesy', 'most', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'me.The', 'story', 'was', 'young', 'maybe', 'early', 'twenties', 'Virginia', 'father', 'being', 'transported', 'magical', 'mirror', 'fairy', 'tale', 'dimension', 'movie', 'many', 'adventures', 'quest', 'find', 'mirror', 'transport', 'back', 'Manhattan', 'be', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'are', 'accompanied', 'quest', 'most', 'not', 'way', 'Wolf', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'werewolf', 'huge', 'crush', 'Virginia', 'also', 'prince', 'who', 'been', 'changed', 'dog', 'evil', 'queen', 'adventures', 'are', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'have', 'humorous', 'moments.My', 'favorite', 'character', 'far', 'was', 'Wolf', 'found', 'quirkiness', 'funny', 'cute', 'man', 'was', 'very', 'hot', 'have', 'say', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Wolf', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'good-looking', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'kept', 'up', 'watching', 'very', 'lengthy', 'movie', 'so', 'diligently', 'guess', 'was', 'actress', 'hot', 'enough', 'keep', 'husband', 'watching.My', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'very', 'end', 'watching', 'such', 'very', 'long', 'movie', 'especially', 'fairy', 'tale', 'expect', 'complete', 'happy', 'ending', 'Even', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'dramatic', 'film', 'truly', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'compaired', 'fluffy', 'miniseries', 'anyway', 'completed', 'trilogy', 'happy', 'ending', 'Well', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'happy', 'ending', 'then', 'down', 'last', 'line', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'movie', 'may', 'help', 'take', 'disappointment', 'away', 'when', 'hear', 'sooo', 'many', 'hours', 'viewing', ""'d"", 'like', 'tell', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'did', ""n't"", 'long', 'more', 'trouble', 'Kingdoms', 'soon', 'happen', 'live', 'life', 'be', 'complete', 'even', 'not', 'long', 'life', 'was', 'just', 'story', 'first', 'book', '10', 'Kingdoms', 'Huh', 'hours', 'watching', 'THIS', 'what', 'get', 'was', 'happy', 'ending', 'was', 'already', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'direction', 'took', 'very', 'very', 'ending', 'voiceover', 'lines', 'ruin', 'not', 'exact', 'quote', 'voiceover', 'close', 'enough', 'Well', 'watching', 'want', 'complete', 'story', 'voiceover', 'coming', 'ruin', 'saying', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'happy', 'long', 'there', 'will', 'be', 'sequel', ""'m"", 'confident', 'there', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'problems', 'was', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'have', 'time', 'hands', 'am', 'continuously', 'disappointed', 'movies', 'rent', 'so', 'purchasing', 'one', '10', 'plenty', 'hours', 'good', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'watching', 'silly', 'fun', 'miniseries', 'just', 'have', 'pretend', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'last', 'minute', 'definitely', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Wolf', 'think', 'up', 'alley', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'movies', 'TV', 'DVD', 'are', 'much', 'better']",The 10th Kingdom VHS

I must have a different idea of what 'family viewing' means as I found it to be in extremely bad taste in parts and to promote (even if subtle) not such great values.  It's a 'realistic' view of fairy tales and certainly tries to shatter the idea the girl marrying the prince and living happily ever after.  Sure that's not always realistic, but these are fairy tales and why try to change a good thing in my opinion.  I really thought a lot of this was nightmare material for some children (and possibly adults).  The characters seem to run from one horror to another and it felt like it would never end.  This may not be a popular review because so many people apparently liked it, but from a Christian perspective I found this movie to be quite disgusting.

480045,A2W6SI073FIRMA,6305818282,KlownArt,"[6, 7]","The Tenth KingdomAfter a television showing on NBC in the late 90s, this cult classic took off. Despite its horrible ratings when appearing on NBC, The Tenth Kingdom has gained a huge following. The original airing showed this series in five two-hour episodes. This video collection shows it on three separate VHS tapes. There are no cuts between the shows. You will see no openings or credits for the show, so it all feels like one big epic tale and not just a television show.Virginia, a young waitress, is living with her father, Tony, and living a fairly normal life. Little do they know that their epic tale was about to unfold. In another dimension, trouble is brewing. Trolls have attacked Snow White Memorial Prison and they have unleashed an Evil Queen. Snow White's killer herself trained this Queen. The Queen quickly explains her plan to take over the Kingdom with the help of the Trolls. Prince Wendell arrives at the prison shortly after in a stop before he reaches his coronation ceremony to be crowned King. The Queen casts a horrible spell on him that makes him trade places with her dog. Wendell escapes in dog form and finds his way to a magic traveling mirror.The mirror leads him to Virginia's world, which is New York. Virginia ends up hitting Wendell with her bike and has to help him. As time goes on, eventually her and her father get sucked into the Fairy Tale world where Wendell is from and must try to escape. They have Trolls, Hunters, and others trying to stop them.This Series isn't one of my favorites. I personally feel that most of the acting just isn't sincere enough. Virginia may be about to be killed, and all she can mutter is ""Ouch, stop hurting me."" There is no real emotion drawn from the characters. The Troll Siblings are very annoying characters. The only real character that I felt developed well is Wolf. Wolf accompanies Virginia on her journey, but he could possibly be under the influence of the Queen. He is probably the only character I liked in this tale.The series is one that progresses well though. Most of Part 1 is boring to watch. Once you pop in the second tape though, it appears to have gotten slightly better. The third tape finally reveals some emotion from Virginia that I wish had been there the entire movie. If you can just stick with it, the series actually turns into a pretty nice show. Most of what happens is predictable, but that doesn't seem to take away from it.Most of the show they are looking for the traveling mirror that just seems to keep escaping their grasps. Virginia often focuses on trying to help others though when she has the mirror and ends up losing it in the process. Eventually, you just get the feeling that they are never going to get that mirror.One huge problem I had with the series was the Evil Queen. In the beginning, she is made to look weak. The Troll King often hinders her, despite her being an all-powerful magical Queen. The Queen never comes off as a threat or as even powerful. With her being the antagonist in the story, this is not good at all.I won't say this is the worst series I've ever watched. I had fun with it, but the acting just isn't sincere enough. The funny parts aren't funny enough and the serious parts aren't serious enough. Still, the story does feel like an epic tale when you look back at all they have done. I wouldn't run out and buy it, but it is something to check into if you have some spare cash.",3,Decent Epic Tale,1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,3435,"['Tenth', 'KingdomAfter', 'television', 'showing', 'NBC', 'late', '90s', 'cult', 'classic', 'took', 'off', 'horrible', 'ratings', 'when', 'appearing', 'NBC', 'Tenth', 'Kingdom', 'gained', 'huge', 'following', 'original', 'airing', 'showed', 'series', 'five', 'two-hour', 'episodes', 'video', 'collection', 'three', 'separate', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'are', 'cuts', 'shows', 'will', 'see', 'openings', 'credits', 'show', 'feels', 'one', 'big', 'epic', 'tale', 'not', 'just', 'television', 'show.Virginia', 'young', 'waitress', 'living', 'father', 'Tony', 'living', 'fairly', 'normal', 'life', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'epic', 'tale', 'was', 'unfold', 'dimension', 'trouble', 'brewing', 'Trolls', 'have', 'attacked', 'Snow', 'White', 'Memorial', 'Prison', 'have', 'unleashed', 'Evil', 'Queen', 'Snow', 'White', 'killer', 'herself', 'trained', 'Queen', 'Queen', 'quickly', 'plan', 'take', 'over', 'Kingdom', 'help', 'Trolls', 'Prince', 'Wendell', 'prison', 'shortly', 'stop', 'coronation', 'ceremony', 'be', 'crowned', 'King', 'Queen', 'horrible', 'spell', 'trade', 'places', 'dog', 'Wendell', 'dog', 'form', 'way', 'magic', 'traveling', 'mirror.The', 'mirror', 'Virginia', 'world', 'New', 'York', 'Virginia', 'up', 'hitting', 'Wendell', 'bike', 'help', 'time', 'eventually', 'father', 'get', 'sucked', 'Fairy', 'Tale', 'world', 'where', 'Wendell', 'must', 'try', 'escape', 'have', 'Trolls', 'Hunters', 'others', 'trying', 'stop', 'them.This', 'Series', ""n't"", 'one', 'favorites', 'personally', 'feel', 'most', 'acting', 'just', ""n't"", 'sincere', 'enough', 'Virginia', 'may', 'be', 'be', 'killed', 'can', 'mutter', 'Ouch', 'stop', 'hurting', 'real', 'emotion', 'drawn', 'characters', 'Troll', 'Siblings', 'are', 'very', 'annoying', 'characters', 'only', 'real', 'character', 'felt', 'developed', 'well', 'Wolf', 'Wolf', 'Virginia', 'journey', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'influence', 'Queen', 'probably', 'only', 'character', 'liked', 'tale.The', 'series', 'one', 'well', 'Most', 'Part', '1', 'boring', 'watch', 'Once', 'pop', 'second', 'tape', 'have', 'gotten', 'slightly', 'better', 'third', 'tape', 'finally', 'emotion', 'Virginia', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'entire', 'movie', 'can', 'just', 'stick', 'series', 'actually', 'pretty', 'nice', 'show', 'Most', 'what', 'predictable', ""n't"", 'seem', 'take', 'away', 'it.Most', 'show', 'are', 'looking', 'traveling', 'mirror', 'just', 'keep', 'escaping', 'grasps', 'Virginia', 'often', 'trying', 'help', 'others', 'when', 'mirror', 'up', 'losing', 'process', 'Eventually', 'just', 'get', 'feeling', 'are', 'never', 'going', 'get', 'mirror.One', 'huge', 'problem', 'had', 'series', 'was', 'Evil', 'Queen', 'beginning', 'made', 'look', 'weak', 'Troll', 'King', 'often', 'being', 'all-powerful', 'magical', 'Queen', 'Queen', 'never', 'off', 'threat', 'even', 'powerful', 'being', 'antagonist', 'story', 'not', 'good', 'all.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'worst', 'series', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'had', 'fun', 'acting', 'just', ""n't"", 'sincere', 'enough', 'funny', 'parts', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'enough', 'serious', 'parts', 'are', ""n't"", 'serious', 'enough', 'Still', 'story', 'feel', 'epic', 'tale', 'when', 'look', 'back', 'have', 'done', 'would', ""n't"", 'run', 'out', 'buy', 'something', 'check', 'have', 'spare', 'cash']",The 10th Kingdom VHS

There are som very funny scenes, like the one where the werewolf has Virginia's grandmother trussed up and ready to cook,the one where Tony is given some wishes and makes the most of his chance to humiliate his obnoxious employer, and the scene where Virgina has to enter a shpeherdess contest and sing a song, &quot;We will, we will shear you&quot;. Virginia's father Tony (John Larroquette) is my favourite character, his commonsense approach to the weird fairytale world is great, (&quot;What is the point of having an evil door?&quot;).  And there is a delightful if strange romance between Virginia (Kimberley Williams) and the wolf (Scott Cohen).  An absolute delight.  Only one regret, at the end of this series there is a hint that there may be furthere adventures to come, but so far we haven't seen any.

480052,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,6305818282,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[225, 239]","Until the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy this movie was the most complex fantasy ever attempted.  In some ways the story does ramble, but the intricate elements are woven together so coherently that they smoothly fit into the quest undertaken by the principal characters.Virginia and Tony Lewis (Kimberly Williams and John Larroquette) live in a New York apartment.  One day a dog enters Virginia's life.  However, the dog is not just any ordinary dog, but Prince Wendell (Daniel Lapaine) changed into a dog by an evil Queen (Dianne Wiest).  Soon trolls enter the story along with magic, and the story begins.Virginia and Tony travel through a magic mirror into the land of the nine kingdoms (with New York being the 10th kingdom.  It takes Virginia and Tony little time to realize that the world they have entered has very different rules from their own.  Their goal is to find a mirror that will allow them to travel back to their own world, and the quest for the mirror forms the heart of the story.Along the way both Virginia and Tony, but most especially Virginia, are on a voyage of discovery about themselves.  Through a series of vignettes they learn the history of the nine kingdoms, and learn there are mysteries related to that history.  One of the most startling revelations is that Virginia and Tony are somehow involved in the nine kingdoms, but it's not until we get well into the movie that we understand the nature of their involvement.The plot is generally coherent and I had little trouble keeping track of the parallel stories.  I admit that there were a few things that confused me when I watched the story in its original television debut, but my confusion was cleared up by watching the DVD version without the commercials and all in one 7+ hour sitting.The acting talent in this movie is phenomenal.  Rutger Hauer plays the Queen's woodsman, with his own poignant story.  Warwick Davis is Acorn, a criminal with a tongue-in-cheek character.  Ed O'Neil is perfect as Relish the Troll King.  Scott Cohen as Wolf took a little getting used to, but once I realized how he fit into the story I enjoyed his antics and characterization.  Camryn Manheim makes an interesting Snow White.  Ann-Margret brings class to Queen Cinderella.  This list is but a fraction of the cast possible by the epic nature of this movie.The story is an adult fairy tale.  There is violence in the movie as well as a number of intense scenes that are likely inappropriate for children below the age of 7 or 8.  However, for everyone else this movie is fun and complicated.  If you enjoy fantasy, and you can be open-minded about how fantasy is approached, this movie could be perfect for you.",5,Complex Epic Fantasy,1068249600,"11 8, 2003",2003,2684,"['Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'movie', 'was', 'most', 'complex', 'fantasy', 'ever', 'attempted', 'ways', 'story', 'ramble', 'intricate', 'elements', 'are', 'woven', 'together', 'so', 'coherently', 'smoothly', 'fit', 'quest', 'undertaken', 'principal', 'characters.Virginia', 'Tony', 'Lewis', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'live', 'New', 'York', 'apartment', 'One', 'day', 'dog', 'Virginia', 'life', 'However', 'dog', 'not', 'just', 'ordinary', 'dog', 'Prince', 'Wendell', 'Daniel', 'Lapaine', 'changed', 'dog', 'evil', 'Queen', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'Soon', 'trolls', 'enter', 'story', 'magic', 'story', 'begins.Virginia', 'Tony', 'travel', 'magic', 'mirror', 'land', 'nine', 'kingdoms', 'New', 'York', 'being', '10th', 'kingdom', 'Virginia', 'Tony', 'little', 'time', 'realize', 'world', 'have', 'entered', 'very', 'different', 'rules', 'own', 'goal', 'find', 'mirror', 'will', 'allow', 'travel', 'back', 'own', 'world', 'quest', 'mirror', 'heart', 'story.Along', 'way', 'Virginia', 'Tony', 'most', 'especially', 'Virginia', 'are', 'voyage', 'discovery', 'series', 'vignettes', 'learn', 'history', 'nine', 'kingdoms', 'learn', 'are', 'mysteries', 'related', 'history', 'One', 'most', 'startling', 'revelations', 'Virginia', 'Tony', 'are', 'somehow', 'involved', 'nine', 'kingdoms', 'not', 'get', 'well', 'movie', 'understand', 'nature', 'involvement.The', 'plot', 'generally', 'coherent', 'had', 'little', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'track', 'parallel', 'stories', 'admit', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'confused', 'when', 'watched', 'story', 'original', 'television', 'debut', 'confusion', 'was', 'cleared', 'up', 'watching', 'DVD', 'version', 'commercials', 'one', '7+', 'hour', 'sitting.The', 'acting', 'talent', 'movie', 'phenomenal', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'Queen', 'woodsman', 'own', 'poignant', 'story', 'Warwick', 'Davis', 'Acorn', 'criminal', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'character', 'Ed', ""O'Neil"", 'perfect', 'Relish', 'Troll', 'King', 'Scott', 'Cohen', 'Wolf', 'took', 'little', 'getting', 'used', 'once', 'realized', 'how', 'fit', 'story', 'enjoyed', 'antics', 'characterization', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'interesting', 'Snow', 'White', 'Ann-Margret', 'brings', 'class', 'Queen', 'Cinderella', 'list', 'fraction', 'cast', 'possible', 'epic', 'nature', 'movie.The', 'story', 'adult', 'fairy', 'tale', 'violence', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'number', 'intense', 'scenes', 'are', 'likely', 'inappropriate', 'children', 'age', '7', '8', 'However', 'everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'fun', 'complicated', 'enjoy', 'fantasy', 'can', 'be', 'open-minded', 'how', 'fantasy', 'approached', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'perfect']",The 10th Kingdom VHS

480058,A3SYT3JC9VH5UZ,6305818282,Marina Michaels,"[3, 3]","I have watched all seven and a half hours (or so) of this miniseries many times, and I still haven't gotten tired of it. And that is from someone who normally only watches even really good movies only once or maybe twice. Why do I love this one so much that it is in my top ten, and is also in my top ten viewed movies of all time?The very basic plot is that Virginia (played by the very talented Kimberly Williams), a young woman still living with her father (played by the equally talented John Larroquette) in New York City, encounters a dog who is actually an enchanted prince from another dimension, the Nine Kingdoms, in which all our fairy tales actually happened.The prince came through a magic traveling mirror to get to New York. He is followed by a trio of trolls, Burly, Blabberwort, and Bluebell, who are a bit less than the brightest bulbs in the bunch. These trolls were sent on the behest of, of course, a wicked queen (played perfectly by Dianne Wiest) who wants to take over the Nine Kingdoms, and she doesn't care who dies on the way. She's also sent Wolf (played wonderfully by Scott Cohen), a man who is part werewolf and considerably brighter than the trolls, after the trolls to make sure they do a good job.Trolls, prince, Wolf, Virginia, and her father all end up back in the Nine Kingdoms. Through various events, Virginia and her father quickly find themselves trapped there, and much of the movie *seems* to be about the two of them, traveling with the prince, trying to find the magic traveling mirror again while being pursued by the trolls and the wicked queen. After many plot twists and turns, the story comes to a grand climax, with everyone getting pretty much what they deserve.I say ""seems to be,"" because there is a much deeper story line going on, which I won't reveal because it would be a major spoiler. Suffice it to say that it is beautifully developed, makes perfect sense, and rounds the story out even more richly. It is partly for this more serious story line that I love this movie so much.  I would love to discuss this story line, but I know a lot of people dislike spoilers. Suffice it to say that it has to do with a theme that not many movies seem to address.In addition, the writing is unaffected and the story is fun. It can seem a bit episodic at times, but each event contributes to our understanding of the characters and their stories. Some of these are low key and gentle; others are not. And I haven't even touched on some of the characters, such as the frightening Huntsman, played by Rutger Hauer, or others, all played well and convincingly.There is plenty of humor in this movie (I especially love how the troll siblings take to the Bee Gees!), but not all fairy tales are free of blood, and this one has some truly chilling moments in it. Because of that, and because of the major story line that I am not revealing, this might not be suitable for smallish children who are easily scared. Otherwise, it is an excellent movie.",5,On my top-ten list; watched many times,1214179200,"06 23, 2008",2008,2991,"['have', 'watched', 'seven', 'half', 'hours', 'so', 'miniseries', 'many', 'times', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'tired', 'someone', 'who', 'normally', 'only', 'even', 'really', 'good', 'movies', 'only', 'once', 'maybe', 'twice', 'Why', 'do', 'love', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'top', 'ten', 'also', 'top', 'ten', 'viewed', 'movies', 'time', 'very', 'basic', 'plot', 'Virginia', 'played', 'very', 'talented', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'young', 'woman', 'still', 'living', 'father', 'played', 'equally', 'talented', 'John', 'Larroquette', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'dog', 'who', 'actually', 'enchanted', 'prince', 'dimension', 'Nine', 'Kingdoms', 'fairy', 'tales', 'actually', 'happened.The', 'prince', 'came', 'magic', 'traveling', 'mirror', 'get', 'New', 'York', 'followed', 'trio', 'trolls', 'Burly', 'Blabberwort', 'Bluebell', 'who', 'are', 'bit', 'less', 'brightest', 'bulbs', 'bunch', 'trolls', 'were', 'sent', 'behest', 'course', 'wicked', 'queen', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Dianne', 'Wiest', 'who', 'take', 'over', 'Nine', 'Kingdoms', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'way', 'also', 'sent', 'Wolf', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Scott', 'Cohen', 'man', 'who', 'part', 'werewolf', 'considerably', 'brighter', 'trolls', 'trolls', 'make', 'sure', 'do', 'good', 'job.Trolls', 'prince', 'Wolf', 'Virginia', 'father', 'end', 'up', 'back', 'Nine', 'Kingdoms', 'various', 'events', 'Virginia', 'father', 'quickly', 'find', 'trapped', 'there', 'much', 'movie', '*seems*', 'be', 'two', 'traveling', 'prince', 'trying', 'find', 'magic', 'traveling', 'mirror', 'again', 'being', 'pursued', 'trolls', 'wicked', 'queen', 'many', 'plot', 'twists', 'turns', 'story', 'grand', 'climax', 'everyone', 'getting', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'deserve.I', 'say', 'be', 'much', 'deeper', 'story', 'line', 'going', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'would', 'be', 'major', 'spoiler', 'Suffice', 'say', 'beautifully', 'developed', 'perfect', 'sense', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'richly', 'partly', 'more', 'serious', 'story', 'line', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'love', 'discuss', 'story', 'line', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'dislike', 'spoilers', 'Suffice', 'say', 'do', 'theme', 'not', 'many', 'movies', 'seem', 'address.In', 'addition', 'writing', 'unaffected', 'story', 'fun', 'can', 'seem', 'bit', 'episodic', 'times', 'event', 'understanding', 'characters', 'stories', 'are', 'low', 'key', 'gentle', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'touched', 'characters', 'such', 'frightening', 'Huntsman', 'played', 'Rutger', 'Hauer', 'others', 'played', 'well', 'convincingly.There', 'plenty', 'humor', 'movie', 'especially', 'love', 'how', 'troll', 'siblings', 'take', 'Bee', 'Gees', 'not', 'fairy', 'tales', 'are', 'free', 'blood', 'one', 'truly', 'chilling', 'moments', 'major', 'story', 'line', 'am', 'not', 'revealing', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'suitable', 'smallish', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'scared', 'Otherwise', 'excellent', 'movie']",The 10th Kingdom VHS

However, once you accept that fact and just go along for the crazy ride, then you will surely love this story. Those wishing for a realistic story or a simple fairytale should look elsewhere. The first 30 minutes of the miniseries moves very slowly, and is a bit boring. However, once you get into the storyline you will enjoy it immensely. The story is basically a compilation of all of the Disney fairytales, the Brothers Grimm stories, Aesops fables, and Mother Goose rhymes, It takes place 200 years after all of the famous fairytale stories concluded. The story in itself is basically a hybrid of the tv show, ""Once Upon A Time"", the movie ""Stardust"", and the tv movie, ""Jack and The Beanstalk - The Real Story"". If you enjoyed any of the previous mentioned stories then you will definitely enjoy this one. It has a great deal of wit, goofiness, and heart. As I stated before, the acting ranged from terribly cheesy, decent, to wonderful. However, all of the characters were charming in their own right. That is why I was able to focus on the story, and zaniness of the characters rather than the quality of the acting. My one complaint would be that they never made a continuation of the story as the ending suggested they would do. Had they avoided the last couple of sentences then everything would have ended nicely. Personally, the Wolf was my absolute favorite character. He was adorable, hilarious, and charming. He was a joy to watch. I also greatly enjoyed the music, especially the use of modern music.

However, it did not do well in the ratings but it did get a lot of fan base on websites etc. I have both the DVD and the VHS and I just absolutely love the DVD version.

480071,A3T0OTH5072YRE,6305818282,"M. Reynard ""kairosdreaming""","[1, 1]","I bounced back and forth from being entertained by this movie, to being utterly bored.  There were just so many flips of character, changes of scene, and other things that made it hard to rate the movie as consistent, and at times I even felt like I was watching a completely different movie.Virginia has grown up with her father in New York City after her mother left them at an early age.  She's bicycling to her job as a waitress when she accidentally hits a dog that runs out in front of her.  She quickly realizes this is no ordinary dog though when a group of trolls and a strange man come after her when she takes him home.  They are chased into a magic portal (along with her father) where they learn the dog is a prince under a spell and an evil queen is trying to kill them and take over the nine kingdoms that are in this world.  Virginia and her father just want to get home, but a strange sense of duty, and a very persistent Wolf who fancies himself in love with Virginia, make getting home difficult.Characters:Kimberly Williams as Virginia LewisJohn Larroquette as Anthony LewisScott Cohen as WolfDianne Wiest as Christine WhiteDaniel Lapaine as Prince WendellRutger Hauer as The HuntsmanHugh O'Gorman, Dawnn Lewis, and Jeremiah Birkett as Burly, Blabberwort, and Bluebell (Trolls)I have to say, the only character I really enjoyed in this movie was Cohen as the Wolf.  There wasn't something so endearing about him, and I just couldn't help think that Virginia didn't deserve him.  Now maybe this is just my knack for picking psychotic men, but I really thought Wolf was cute and worthy of love, despite how strange and sometimes enraged he could become.  At least he honestly did seem to have feelings for Virginia, even if he was spurned so many times.  And he was funny, his mannerisms and little speeches did have a wolfish quality about them and even though some of the humor was groan worthy, he by far was the most entertaining character.  I wish I could say the same for Virginia and her father but they were slightly idiotic and selfish and never seemed to redeem themselves throughout the series.  They'd be on their way to doing something good when one or the other would be distracted by something they wanted instead.  And while I normally like Williams in a lot of her roles, I can't say she did a fantastic job in this one, it was just too all over the place in terms of acting.  Wiest did a good job as the evil Queen and she appeared to be the only other genuine character in this movie that was there to make a point rather than a laugh.I couldn't figure out what the main point of this movie was.  Whether it was just for the comedy, or if there was an actual lesson buried under the humor.  Certainly it was very funny in parts, but it almost had to be to hide the matricide, murder, violence, filicide, and sexual innuendos.  This is not a kid's movie but rather for adults fond of the fantasy genre.  And it doesn't scrimp on the violence because we actually see someone get kicked brutally or a severed head waved around or other like things.  I don't have a problem with such scenes, but I know a lot of people do, and they probably shouldn't watch this series.  I do have to say that the plot was almost a journey, they went from point to point searching for something and while they didn't necessarily learn anything along the way, they still had adventure and it was interesting to watch.  There were a few slow parts (especially when Wolf wasn't there) that I could have done without, but I didn't think there was too much of the movie that shouldn't be there, even if it is hours and hours long (466 minutes).The cinematography was pretty well done in this.  Some of it was cheesy, like the graphics in the Kissing Town, but I think it was supposed to be that way.  And I liked the costuming and other effects that were used to make this movie seem as if it were in a fairy tale kingdom.  And while the graphics for the mirror were a bit sub-par, the rest were well done.  The music, I can't say I particularly enjoyed any of it, but it didn't want to make me rip my hair out either.  It was kind of just there in the background.This was a funny, entertaining show, but it did have a lot of flaws.  I probably wouldn't watch it again, which is why I'm rating it average.  But it did provide some amusement for a one time view.Review by M.

Along with her father, Virginia goes with the dog (whom they've adequately dubbed 'Prince') through a magic mirror into another world.This world of 9 Kingdoms is a fairy-tale kingdom - or really, THE fairy tale kingdom; you meet Snow White, Cinderella, 3 German mice, a nameless woodsman, the shepherd Peeps, and many other well-known fairy tale characters. In their journey to get back home, Virginia and her father encounter werewolves, dwarves, goblins, magic mirrors, an evil stepmother, and a poisoned apple.Adventure, humor, romance, war, and intrigue, this movie is great for children (ages 6-18 proven!) and adults alike.",5,the 10th Kingdom,1072828800,"12 31, 2003",2003,1117,"['Originally', 'viewed', 'television', 'movie', '7', 'hours', 'long', '7', 'hours', 'while', 'get', 'fun', 'called', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'most', 'set', '9', 'Kingdoms', '10th', 'kingdom', 'actually', 'world', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'Virginia', 'father', 'live', 'right', 'Central', 'Park', 'When', 'Virginia', 'dog', 'understand', 'what', 'saying', 'caught', 'up', 'plot', 'take', 'over', 'kingdom', '4th', 'kingdom', 'father', 'Virginia', 'dog', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'adequately', 'dubbed', ""'Prince"", 'magic', 'mirror', 'world.This', 'world', '9', 'Kingdoms', 'fairy-tale', 'kingdom', 'really', 'THE', 'fairy', 'tale', 'kingdom', 'meet', 'Snow', 'White', 'Cinderella', '3', 'German', 'mice', 'nameless', 'woodsman', 'shepherd', 'Peeps', 'many', 'other', 'well-known', 'fairy', 'tale', 'characters', 'journey', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'Virginia', 'father', 'encounter', 'werewolves', 'dwarves', 'goblins', 'magic', 'mirrors', 'evil', 'stepmother', 'poisoned', 'apple.Adventure', 'humor', 'romance', 'war', 'intrigue', 'movie', 'great', 'children', '6-18', 'proven', 'adults', 'alike']",The 10th Kingdom VHS

480093,A4FX5YCJA630V,6305818282,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[15, 28]","I am somewhat hesitant to write a negative review for 'The 10th Kingdom', as it seems everybody else loves this mini-series, and we all know that you don't give helpful votes to reviews that actually *are* helpful, but on whether or not you agree with the reviewer's opinion. And here's mine: the 10th Kingdom did not get good ratings on television, and it was for good reason. Although it is colourful, lively, lengthy and entertaining, it is very deeply flawed, and many times this escapist bit of fantasy brings you jarringly back to reality.Virginia Lewis is a waitress in New York, living with her janitor father Antony Lewis, with a mother that abandoned them when she was just a little girl. Neither of them are particularly satisfied with their lives. Meanwhile, in the parallel lands of the Nine Kingdoms the Crown Prince Wendell White has been trapped inside a labrador's body by the ""Evil Queen"" (the Queen of what exactly?) during a prison visit, and stumbles into an activated Magic Mirror, transporting him to New York City. The Queen makes her escape, sending three trolls, the children of her ally King Relish and another escapee Wolf into New York to retrieve Wendell-in-Dog, whilst she takes Dog-in-Wendell to her estate with a plot to take over the realms.The two stories collide when a disorientated Wendell stumbles through Central Park and is hit by Virginia's bike on her way to work. In the cataclysmic events that follow Virginia gets the fairytale adventure she's always wanted - but it's not exactly what she expected.To go into anymore detail on the story would mean exceeding the number of words I'm allowed in a review - the movie is seven hours long, safe to say: lots of stuff happens. But the plot itself is somewhat choppy and confusing and can be divided into three main chunks: Antony and Virginia escape the police; Antony and Virginia try to find the mirror to send them home; Antony and Virginia save the kingdom. This last plot thread undoubtably sounds the most interesting and exciting, however most of the seven hours is taken up with the two of them travelling through various lands after the mirror; everything they do is somehow motivated by simply wanting to get home again, back to those boring lives they take such great pleasure in complaining about.One wonders why the writers didn't choose to edge into this far more interesting 'kingdom-restoration' narrative rather than the limited wild-goose chase. The reason seems to be (rather shockingly) that the Nine Kingdoms aren't *worth* saving! Throughout the entire story there are barely any sympathetic or worthy people in the fairytale world, and the few that are usually end up dead. To illustrate my point: the governers in Wendell's castle are more interested in Wendell's coronation celebrations than their Prince's safety; the gypsies chase our heroes, intent on murder and then curse them; the dwarfs of the mountain try to execute them twice; the denizens of Kissing Town seem friendly enough, but when a mirror is broken they turn into an angry mob; and a pastorial town has within it murder, theft, a fixed justice system, a fondness for stake-burning, and worse of all: annual beauty pagents! Even the benevolent figure of Snow White is guilty of making her stepmother dance in red-hot slippers.Also in question is the presumption that this is a kid's movie. Perhaps if it had been shot in darker, more mysterious moods and colours I would be more content in this regard (after all, the original fairytales were intented for adults), but the colourful props and costumes and the bright beautiful scenery suggest a children's movie. A warning to parents of young children: this is *not* a kid's movie, and some of the content may be hard on even older viewers. For instance: the trolls are prepared to torture Virginia, a decapitated head is dangled out of a window, a gathering of trolls is painfully poisoned, a tribe of gypsies is graphically murdered (which presumable includes a young boy that Wolf earlier befriended), a grandfather kills his grand-daughter, and a mother repeatedly attempts to kill her own daughter.Despite the huge running time, the protaginists have no depth or development at all. Near the start, Tony seems to have no scruples about sleeping with another man's wife whilst she's under a spell, and at the conclusion, Wendell encourages him to make full use of his status as ""national-hero"" to impress the court ladies eying him up on the other side of the table. Virginia fares a little better, but parents might be shocked to see the 'tail stroking' and the 'hide and seek' game between her and Wolf, and the relationship between her and her father (and her mother for that matter) is never fully realised.However, this movie does succeed in one very important area: it's ENTERTAINING. Most humour is very good - especially Tony's increasing frustration at the quirks and cliches of the fairytale realm, and Wendell's neverending snobbery though he's firmly trapped in the body of a humble dog. The romance between Wolf and Virginia is quite sweet, and out of everyone Scott Cohen puts on the best performance, moving from puppy-dog love to wild frenzy when his werewolf character emerges under the full moon. The scale of the movie is very impressive, as is most of the visual elements: scenery, costumes, makeup and special effects, and most European fairytales are included in one form or another.It's a fun ride throughout, just not as wonderful as other reviewers would have you believe, and as it is, the movie ends with betrayal, insanity, matricide, and an unwanted pregancy...oh, but its a happy ending!",3,Mixed Feelings,1054166400,"05 29, 2003",2003,5653,"['am', 'somewhat', 'hesitant', 'write', 'negative', 'review', '10th', 'Kingdom', 'everybody', 'else', 'mini-series', 'know', 'do',

It never realy crossed my mind to rent it or see it until my friend recommended it to me as one of her favourites. Even then I didn't see it for awhile, until my dad rented it unexpectedly when we were in need of something to watch.With my three younger siblings, and my older sister we started it out, not exactly sure what to expect. The first 15 minutes did not prove to us that this movie was worth watching-especially with my younger siblings in the room. It had a few doo-dads (aptly so quickly into it) that made us sure it had been rated TV 14. So we turned it off, and they all watched something else.But, due to my friend, (who has so much in common with me it's truly frightening) her recommendation of it nagged at me-if she liked it, it must be at least semi-good!So, by my self, I watched the first tape. It was truly amazing to me how much more fun this movie got in it's progression-and by almost the end of the frst tape I found my self in love with it all, the story, truly original, the characters thoroughly loveable, (especially Wolf, who I find temptingly cute. ;) and the movie's magical attribute, that made you never bored in the slightest and on the edge of your pants seat. The trolls halarious and crazy antics and Wolf's love-stricken statements about Virginia had me in fits of laughter.I waited to surmise the magic on the second night, slipping in the rest of the first tape with sweet anticipation. My older sister, who was apprehensive sat down also in interest. I had to explain a bit to her-after all she only saw the first fifteen minutes and was now skipped all the way to the Gypsies, but before long she was also wrapped into it.We finished the first tape and immediately stuck in the second. The beginning of the movie clearly was not the whole thing! We laughed and gasped and bit our nails, having the most fun we've had in a long time. Kissing Town-throughly sickening and funny at the same time (to quote our without-a-doubt favourite character, Wolf 'Everyone falls in love in Kissing Town') and the throughly surprising aspects of the entire thing makes it the funnest and most enchanting movie I've seen in a long time.Pure delightment, fun, and entertainment, The 10th Kingdom will hold you hard once the movie starts up, and it grasps with a hard and exciting grip until the very end. I loved it-and my sister loved it too. We could not have been more mistaken about this movie in our first opinion, and I can't wait to purchase it, to be able to watch it many, many more times.

The 10th Kingdom is something I remember seeing in the video store over and over again when it first came out, but it was never enough to tempt me to watch it. Honestly, I believed it would be a little sub-par on every level, and was biased because it was made-for-TV. Even now, after finally deciding to watch it, I was looking at the case and having second thoughts. Finally, last night, I decided to watch one episode, and if it was no good, I could just turn it off and never look at it again. And you know what? I never turned it off. Not until it was done, and then I wished it had gone on forever. I was hooked almost immediately.I've adore mythology, fairy and folk tales, so it was nice to see so many winks at those stories of old. Especially some of the more original, non-Disney tellings of the better known ones. Like the wicked queen poisoning Snow White three times, with the corset and comb. Not to mention how they weaved in so many others, such as Rapunzel and Little Red Riding Hood. Plus, I'm every bit the sentimental romantic, and the story of Virginia and Wolf was pitch perfect the whole time. theA small word of caution on how this will ""enchant audiences of all ages"": I ended up watching this with my 11-year-old sister, and even though it's from Hallmark and was classified as family entertainment, there were more than a few moments that were clearly meant for adult audiences. The evil villains are truly evil, and there is a good deal of violence and a smattering of language, and the story took the opportunity to explore the wolf's legendary identity in fairy tales as a lecherous predator (see Neil Jordan's film, The Company of Wolves).

The 10th Kingdom clocks in at just under seven hours and I only made it thirty-nine minutes before I resigned myself to the fact that I could by no means in good conscience finish the movie.Allow me to put it plainly: The 10th Kingdom is the worst thing I've seen in memory. There may have been worse. I just can't remember anything as bad.Some may think it unfair of me to judge a story of which I have only experienced 9.35% its entire product, but I can assure that the rest of the movie could be Citizen Kane and the still not redeem the horror foisted upon viewers in the first hour.Where do the problems lie? Chiefly in the acting. Or over-acting. Painful over-acting. The only thing inoffensive to me was Kimberly Williams - though I suspect I may be here influenced by the childhood crush I fostered from her work in Father of the Bride. The story I had no such past affection for and I was thence unable to overlook its stench. Even the musical cues were overwrought and painful.Still, I imagine that ten-year-olds might get a kick out of the show and think the writing witty and urbane. Take that for what it's worth.P.S. Since originally penning my review, I have been subjected to the rest of the movie (as my wife had to watch it at the bequest of her sixth-grade students). Dreadful, dreadful stuff.

Although it's more than 400 minutes long, never once does ""The 10th Kingdom"" get boring or lag in anyway.  The bit near the end with the singing magic mushrooms is funny beyond all reason.And this is also due in part to the superb acting.  Rutger Hauer is chilling as the predatory Huntsman, while Dianne West is ice cold as The Queen.  Ed O'Neill brings just the right mix of evil and idiocy to his role of Relish the Troll King, while Hugh O'Gorman, Dawnn Lewis, and Jeremiah Birkett are hilarious as his children Burly, Blabberwort, and Bluebell.  Daniel Lapaine is very good as both Prince Wendell and the canine impostor, Kimberly Williams gives a great performance as Virginia Lewis, and Scott Cohen almost steals the show as Wolf.The one who DOES steal the show--at least, to me anyway--was John Larroquette as Tony Lewis.  His sarcastic asides and continual flipping between optimism and pessimism make him possibly the best realized character, and John Larroquette does a magnificent job portraying him.All in all, I HIGHLY recommend ""The 10th Kingdom.""

The idea was a tough one to pull off--after all, how do you mess with not just ONE classic fairy tale,  but a whole slew of them!  10th Kingdom works because it treats these  great fairy tales with reverence, wit, and good old fashioned panache; it  combines these gems in a story that is fresh and very well-imagined. Kudos  to the writers, who rarely displayed the kind of smug self-indulgence so  common on tv today. The cast was also superb in every way, particularly  Kimberly Williams, who lights up the screen with both her assured acting  and pixieish charm. John Larroquette scores as well in his role, as does  Dianne Weist as the recalcitrant Mother from Hell. Note the appearance of  Warwick Davis (of Willow, Leprechaun fame) as Acorn!

480119,A2491AQB89D4N5,6305818282,Willard C. Smith,"[10, 17]","I would characterize the 10th Kingdom as a plot-driven epic, not a character-driven story. Plot-driven stories depend on the twists and turns of the story's sequences to keep one's attention. Character-driven stories  depend on the development of the characters in response to the plot to keep  one's attention. Although the 10th Kingdom has all sorts of possibilities  for character development, none of it really pans out. That weakness will  be discussed a little later.The overall strengths and weaknesses of this  story are centered in its plot.  The length of this film should be the  first clue that the story is epic in nature. Although the plot initially  suggests a restoration theme, it soons switches to a search (initially for  the means to return to their own world), and finally becomes (to rephrase  the theme in PC terms) a parent quest.  Cambell's studies on Mythology,  reintroduced to the modern world the epic concept of a son searching for  his father and thus coming to understand his identity. The 10th Kingdom is  really about Virginia searching for her mother and coming to understand her  identity.But this is not a nice fairy tale. Unlike STAR WARS, which had  the same theme, the 10th Kingdom does not concern itself with redemption.  Rather the child becomes directly responsible for the parent's unredemptive  death. This should have been  a tragedy, but everything is neatly swept  under the rug with the excuse that the mother was insane (in other words  beyond redemption), hence the strange Happily Ever After Ending.The  ending of this story could lead to an interesting discussion of the nature  of Fairy Tales in our lives (Happly Ever After, Inspite of insurmountable  barriers), and other dramas, such as INTO THE WOODS, have discussed the  same issues. I understand that the primary purpose of the original Brothers  Grimm was to try to  understand the German national character by examining  its Folk Tales. These were indeed dark stories: recall that Hansel and  Gretel were not sent into the woods by their Step-mother. No, their mother  was responsible for trying to leave them in the woods to die.The Fairy  World of the 10th Kingdom is full of (as Tony puts it) homicidal maniacs.  There is a great suggestion of insanity everywhere. Even Snow White (in the  history of this world) is responsible for torturing her step-mother at her  wedding. A huntsman is tricked into killing his son, yet serves the person  who tricked him instead of seeking revenge. Bo Peep is a little creep and  is killed by her Grandfather. The reason that this horror doesn't become  overbearing is that most everything is played for laughs.The plot  becomes the first major weakness of this epic. We see all sorts of dark  (and also amusing) versions of our fairy tales, but few of them really lend  themselves to any of the quests, rather they seems like unnecessary side  trips. And  there are so many of these side trips that don't seem to add  anything to the story progression, that one begins to wonder if the trips  are simply an excuse for the writer to poke fun at another tale. Well, if  that is what you like, OK, but  one of my children got bored to tears about  half way through the film and gave up. She didn't even care to know how it  turned out in the end.Then there is the problem with the characters. In  this entire cast, there are only two characters who show any level of  multi-dimension. Let me take a moment and explain what I mean by  multi-dimension. It is a character, whose decisions can surprise you  because there are many dimensions to their motives. If the character's  behavior is predictable, then they are one-dimensional. This film is  unfortunately chock-full of single dimensional characters. That is  unfortunate because the potential for better characters is clearly  there.For example, Virginia is described as having changed by being more  self reliant, but anyone who has seen the film knows that isn't true.  Virginia is just as self reliant at the first of the story as at the end.  The only thing is that she may have realized it more, but that doesn't lend  itself to character development. Tony is suppose to have become more brave.  Does anyone really belive that?Is it any surprise that it is the Wicked  Stepmother and Wolf who show any level of multi-dimension, although even  they become predictable near the end of the story.Do I recommend this  film? Yes, but it is not a five star movie.
