1244107,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001VPJZ0O,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","In 2005, ""Grey's Anatomy"" became a critically acclaimed television series that would become ABC's top rated dramas and winner of two Emmy and Golden Globe Awards.Created by Shonda Rhimes (""Private Practice""), the drama series revolves around a group of interns and their experience at Seattle Grace Hospital.  As well, as a few of the other doctors of the hospital.  Throughout the first four seasons, we see these interns become residents and experience relationship problems and also the stress and challenges they had to become a resident doctor.For season five, ""Grey's Anatomy"" received its share of hype on entertainment magazines with rumors swirling of talent who were no longer going to be on the show and that tension was developing on the set.  For this fifth season, the season did start off with stories that seemed a bit farfetched and a tad bit hokey, but for the most part, redeemed itself for the second half with solid storytelling.""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Fifth Season - More Moments"" features 24 episodes (Episodes 79-102) on six discs:VIDEO & AUDIO:""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Fifth Season - More Moments"" is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1) - Enhanced for 16x9 televisions.  When it comes to television drama series, ""Grey's Anatomy"" is one of ABC's highly rated dramas that although filmed in a hospital setting for the most part of the series, season five definitely indulges in beauty during a major wedding scene which featured solid cinematography. And speaking of the wedding, that was one of the most enchanting wedding scenes that I have seen in a drama series.  Absolutely beautiful!For the most part, the series looks good on DVD, nice good closeups and skintones are natural and during low light scenes, I didn't see any major noise or compression artifacts.  For the most part, the fifth season does look very good on DVD.As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and the series is primarily dialogue and music driven.  Dialogue is clean and understandable, while the music has always played a major part for the series and definitely enhances certain scenes.  Personally, I found it much more appealing to have my receiver set at stereo on all channels.The show is presented in English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Fifth Season - More Moments"" includes the following special features:DISC 7:* Dissecting Grey's Anatomy - Unaired Scenes - A total of eleven unaired scenes with optional commentary with Creator/Executive Producer Shondra Rhimes and Executive Producer Betsy Beers.* In Stitches: Season Five Outtakes - (4:03) Season five bloopers.* 100th Episode: Tales from the O.R. - (18:30) The crew and talents talk about working on the show and how grateful they are to the fans.  Staff talk about the making of the series and keeping the medical segments factual and also the big wedding scene.* Heaven Sent - (9:30) For fans of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), this featurette focuses on how Creator/Executive Producer Shondra Rhimes and Executive Producer Betsy Beers hired Jeffrey Dean Morgan for the role.  Jeffrey talks about how he auditioned for the role and the audience reaction and more.JUDGMENT CALL:I have to admit that when ""Grey's Anatomy"" season five started, I thought the series has lost its vibe and was becoming another ""ER"" like-clone where stories would simply become to farfetched and hokey.  But during the second half of the season, things simply changed.  We started to get solid storylines that built-up to the best season finale for ""Grey's Anatomy"" ever.I think part of the mystique about the series this season was the hype and gossip about what was going on behind-the-scenes.  Who is leaving the show?  Who isn't leaving the show?  Would we even care for Izzie due to Katherine Heigl's behavior off-set?  The lesbian storyline.  The brain tumor storyline. Who is disgruntled?  Who isn't being utilized all that much in the show.  So, many things that could have gone wrong... but in the end, it was the writing for the series that managed to win viewers all over again.From the cross-over with ""Private Practice"", the return of Denny, a wedding, many new characters and so much more... But personally, it was those final four episodes that made viewers remember why we stuck with over 100 episodes of this drama series.  Although, I can do without the icicle impaling  or the interns surgically experimenting on each other (which to me was just too campy).As or the DVD, I was expecting episode commentaries (it would have been wonderful to hear commentary for the 1ooth episode and the season finale) and something a bit more for the special features section but for the most part, what is featured is quite satisfactory.Overall, ""Grey's Anatomy - Complete Fifth Season - More Moments"" may have started out a bit hokey and farfetched but the season redeemed itself right at the end and had its most significant season finale ever.  If you are a ""Grey's Anatomy"" fan, one again, another DVD box set worth adding to your collection.",5,"The fifth season started out a bit hokey but by the second half, this series soared to new

1244114,A17V5NNFG7QGKS,B001VPJZ0O,Eve Galewitz,"[4, 4]","Shonda Rhimes outdid herself this season with the Denny-Izzy storyline.  It was practically a movie in and of itself with Ms. Heigl & Mr. Morgan playing their ill-fated romance to death DO US NOT part.  On the other side, Izzy seems to finally made of man of the chip on his shoulder bigger than a boulder Dr. Alex Korev.  Also well played by Justin ChambersMeredith & Derek became almost secondary characters until Derek's breakdown following an unsuccessful surgery - which was not a bad thing as the show tended to rest a little to heavily on McDreamy & Mare and there on-again off-again silliness.  Meredith was much more interesting interacting with her Mom's diaries, dealing with her mixed feelings for the ""chief"" and with her ""person"" Christina Yang.  And speaking of my favorite cold-hearted surgical resident, we finally found out a little about how she got that way through her sudden passion for McArmy surgeon Owen Hunt.  McKidd was a perfect addition to the cast & a great foil for Yang, who needed a man with a little more angst than Mcdreamy & McSteamy provide.McSteamy & little Gray gave Gray's the comic turn it needed to keep from drowning in the drama, with Lexie showing Dr. love 'em and leave 'em Sloan what it feels to be the woman in the relationship.  Also bringing up the comedy factor was the adorable Sara Ramirez as Dr. Callie Torres, who when not fixing broken bones was exploring her sexuality with both genders.Chandra Wilson deserved special praise for taking Dr. Bailey to a whole other level in Season 5.  Watching her compassion while hold a dying child, or like a little girl at Christmas with her new medical equipment or facing divorce she was all over the place emotionally.  What a performance.Eric Stoltz was brilliant as the psycho under Meredith's care, while James Pickens, Jr., as Dr. Richard Webber is the glue that holds it all together as the chief of staff of Seattle Grace.  I hope next season we see a bit more of Dr. Webber & his wife, especially in light of his confession to Meredith about how his relationship with Ellis and effect on her.T.R.

1244126,A26DQ4BMK67XBX,B001VPJZ0O,Lorrie A. Jones,"[0, 2]","I think the whole thing was good.With Christina and Han, the way Christina dealt with Dr. Han was really good, she handled her characterreal well and Dr Han really show he had the soldier trama In his past, plus with his ex fiancee.Dr.O'Malley  , where he is being at that child's level when he wasn't going to have the surgery and pulls the fire alarm and when O'Malley later had to deal with the child again didn't want the I V and he had to show him how it is done and was after he allowed them to do it. then there is Bailey her strong attitude and softness with children hitat the sometime that was a hard role to play. Plus when Richard had to ask patience wives or loved ones for there organ's for the child that needed parts from other donors. That is hard to have to ask the the relative this and the patient is brain dead, not ready to let them go for other sake.Dr. Gray had built a house with candles and then they had to delay there wedding a lot. She was not ready for him yet. She is afraid that Derick doesn't want her crappy children and says yes I do. there was a episode where Derickhad killed a women while she was pregnant and couldn't get her back and got sued from the Husband that wanted hiswife back instead of baby , which I thought was sad , even though he said we could have another child but can't have another child again later. why give up a child that is almost term and you can advance the lungs so the child can survive. They might of been able to keep the child and mother. But that is life's tough choices that we have to be able to except in our lives. The choice of knowing if your child is going to survive and while you wife is critical too. Sometimes you lose them both.Lizzy and her Ghost Fiance that was creepy. She only could see him but not others , so everyone had to think sheis losing it. And talking to herself, plus having sex seine with her dead fiance' is weird to except too.then she finds  out later that she is dieing of cancer due to tumors and that's why her fiance' is there he is her tumor? then they operate on her and then she still see's him again which means another surgery.she also meets her fiance at the elevator, so surgery Goes well and then passes out no pulse. They are reviving her and nothing and this time she meets O'Malley at the elevator. and she hesitates. Then the program leaves you anticipations for next season.Lexy Gray gets together with an older man which happens in real life anyway.Dr. Sloan gets broken which no lady has ever done to him. Then he is fixed. He asks Lexy to move in with him andLexy got the Idea of marriage too.The funny part that he says he is a better girl then her when buying the house.This season has a lot of Kids in it. Which is tear breaking.But they fight to get them well. Which is adrenaline time.Then O'Malley gets hit by a bus by saving a lady almost getting killed .He comes in and you can't even recognize him at all I didn't even know who that was, because I thought he was in listing at the army. Then he writes in Gray's hand three times until it hit her, and she really panicked.Everyone jump right on it and tried to save O'Malley .The part with Alex and Lizzy getting Married was awesome. what a gift to give when she admitted she loved Alex.But down deep I know she will always remember her dead fiance. He gives part of him when she saved her eggs forfertilization later and Alex was very uncomfortable of what he had to do , he said It is not how you make a baby.Derek part where is angry at everyone and himself of the death of the women he killed. Gray never seen him that mad. But she let him alone and they had her come back to him to bring Linzy ex rays to him so he could operate onher since he has a gift for this. So she got him back to surgery.Callie wow what a change from one way to the other way of life. I have seen this in life before , She did do herrole very well with the women in her life. The women were able to live together with Christina and made out to be good roommates so far.Christina is a tough character. Try's not to show her feelings. She does try to keep a professional approach towards things and she goes on. Even if she is hurt for that time she picks herself up and goes on with life.The part with Christina is with Dr Han and his night time episode and he is chocking her.I can not wait for the next season comesHeartfulofmusic",5,Gray's anatomy season 5,1255910400,"10 19, 2009",2009,4391,"['think', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'good.With', 'Christina', 'Han', 'way', 'Christina', 'dealt', 'Dr.', 'Han', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'handled', 'characterreal', 'well', 'Dr', 'Han', 'really', 'show', 'had', 'soldier', 'trama', 'past', 'ex', ""fiancee.Dr.O'Malley"", 'where', 'being', 'child', 'level', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'have', 'surgery', 'fire', 'alarm', 'when', ""O'Malley"", 'later', 'had', 'deal', 'child', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'V', 'had', 'show', 'how', 'done', 'was', 'allowed', 'do', 'then', 'Bailey', 'strong', 'attitude', 'softness', 'children', 'hitat', 'sometime', 'was', 'hard', 'role', 'play', 'when', 'Richard', 'had', 'ask', 'patience', 'wives', 'loved', 'ones', 'child', 'needed', 'parts', 'other', 'donors', 'hard', 'have', 'ask', 'relative', 'patient', 'brain', 'dead', 'not', 'ready', 'let', 'go', 'other', 'sake.Dr', 'Gray', 'had', 'built', 'house', 'candles', 'then', 'had', 'delay', 'there', 'wedding', 'lot', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'yet', 'afraid', 'Derick', ""n't"", 'want', 'crappy', 'children', 'yes', 'do', 'was', 'episode', 'where', 'Derickhad', 'killed', 'women', 'was', 'pregnant', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'back', 'got', 'sued', 'Husband', 'wanted', 'back', 'instead', 'baby', 'thought', 'was', 'sad', 'even', 'said', 'could', 'have', 'child', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'child', 'again', 'later', 'why', 'give', 'up', 'child', 'almost', 'term', 'can', 'advance', 'lungs', 'child', 'can', 'survive', 'might', 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'child', 'mother', 'life', 'tough', 'choices', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'except', 'lives', 'choice', 'knowing', 'child', 'going', 'survive', 'wife', 'critical', 'too', 'Sometimes', 'lose', 'both.Lizzy', 'Ghost', 'Fiance', 'was', 'creepy', 'only', 'could', 'see', 'not', 'others', 'everyone', 'had', 'think', 'sheis', 'losing', 'talking', 'herself', 'having', 'sex', 'seine', 'dead', 'fiance', 'weird', 'except', 'too.then', 'out', 'later', 'dieing', 'cancer', 'due', 'tumors', 'why', 'fiance', 'there', 'tumor', 'then', 'operate', 'then', 'still', 'see', 'again', 'surgery.she', 'also', 'fiance', 'elevator', 'so', 'surgery', 'Goes', 'well', 'then', 'out', 'pulse', 'are', 'reviving', 'nothing', 'time', ""O'Malley"", 'elevator', 'Then', 'program', 'anticipations', 'next', 'season.Lexy', 'Gray', 'together', 'older', 'man', 'real', 'life', 'anyway.Dr', 'Sloan', 'broken', 'lady', 'ever', 'done', 'Then', 'fixed', 'Lexy', 'move', 'andLexy', 'got', 'Idea', 'marriage', 'too.The', 'funny', 'part', 'better', 'girl', 'then', 'when', 'buying', 'house.This', 'season', 'lot', 'Kids', 'Which', 'tear', 'fight', 'get', 'well', 'Which', 'adrenaline', 'time.Then', ""O'Malley"", 'hit', 'bus', 'saving', 'lady', 'almost', 'getting', 'killed', '.He', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'who', 'was', 'thought', 'was', 'listing', 'army', 'Then', 'Gray', 'hand', 'three', 'times', 'hit', 'really', 'panicked.Everyone', 'jump', 'right', 'tried', 'save', ""O'Malley"", '.The', 'part', 'Alex', 'Lizzy', 'getting', 'Married', 'was', 'awesome', 'what', 'gift', 'give', 'when', 'admitted', 'loved', 'Alex.But', 'down', 'deep', 'know', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'dead', 'fiance', 'part', 'when', 'saved', 'eggs', 'forfertilization', 'later', 'Alex', 'was', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'what', 'had', 'do', 'said', 'not', 'how', 'make', 'baby.Derek', 'part', 'where', 'angry', 'everyone', 'death', 'women', 'killed', 'Gray', 'never', 'seen', 'mad', 'let', 'alone', 'had', 'come', 'back', 'bring', 'Linzy', 'ex', 'rays', 'so', 'could', 'operate', 'onher', 'gift', 'got', 'back', 'surgery.Callie', 'wow', 'what', 'change', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'way', 'life', 'have', 'seen', 'life', 'did', 'do', 'herrole', 'very', 'well', 'women', 'life', 'women', 'were', 'able', 'live', 'together', 'Christina', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'roommates', 'far.Christina', 'tough', 'character', 'Try', 'not', 'show', 'feelings', 'try', 'keep', 'professional', 'approach', 'towards', 'things', 'Even', 'hurt', 'time', 'up', 'life.The', 'part', 'Christina', 'Dr', 'Han', 'night', 'time', 'episode', 'chocking', 'her.I', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'next', 'season', 'comesHeartfulofmusic']",N/A

1244138,A2CZXIEBCR4YCY,B001VPJZ0O,The Opinionista,"[141, 143]","SPOILERS---DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO BE SURPRISEDSomewhere halfway through this 5th season, I decided it would be my last. I was even tempted to stop right then and there.  I think this happened around the same time that Izzie was having mind-boggling sex with Denny (the dead ex).  But I decided to wait until the end.  Who knows why?And I am so glad I did.  I have just finished watching the season finale.  I have been downloading the episodes from iTunes since the season will not be out in DVD for a while.  I still wanted to write a review in case you are hesitating to buy this season.So without further delay or hesitation I say BUY IT.  The 2nd half of the season more than makes up for the weaknesses in the first half, and the season finale is so good that it's worth to get it just for this.  Well, to be honest, the season finale is devastating.  So much so that it reignites your desire to watch the show and come back for the 6th Season.But getting back to Season 5....there are a few reasons why this season is very good:1.  The Derek/Meredith situation is resolved and this is great.  It is good to see a happy ending to these 2, especially after 4 years of following their ups and downs.  The show's creator wanted to deliver this to the fans and she made the right call on this. I think people would have been turned off if Meredith and Derek had  split permanently or if their story would have kept being dragged on.2.  What started as the unlikely couple of Sloan and Lexi, has developed into a really nice story line where he sheds his playboy lifestyle for a more committed relationship.  Lexi's character is also growing quite nicely, from an almost defenseless ""little girl"" to a mature woman that centers Sloan.  They are also quite beautiful together as a couple, and well I'm really rooting for them....3.  Cali is finding happiness with Arizona.  I love the Arizona character, and the actress that plays her is absolutely great.  It is a treat to see this couple blossoming.  It was a great decision to get rid of Cali's ex girlfriend...she was a bitter and sad person and not at all matched to Cali's lighthearted nature.  Arizona's bubbly personality is great for Cali.  I love how they wrote in her skating around the hospital....On the other hand she has been instrumental in  Dr. Bailey's discovery of her softer side and her preference for pediatrics as her specialty.4.  Christina and Owen are going through major bumps, but there's an intensity to their relationship that is great to watch, and by the end of the season, it's nice to see how their story evolves.5.  While I was annoyed with Izzie's and Denny's story line, Katherine Heigl gives a great performance towards the end of the season, and so does the actor that plays Alex Karev.  Alex's character, so rough at times, shows an increased sensitivity as Izzie gets sicker, and well, it's heart-wrenching to see his pain.THE BIGGEST SPOILERS FOLLOW....STOP READING....OR ELSE.....6.  The fact that George walks Izzie down the aisle is sweet and poignant.7.  The moment when Meredith realizes that George is John Doe is one of the most powerful scenes I have seen on TV.  I had to watch it a couple of times and plan to go back to it.  She was amazing in that scene.8.  When Izzie faces George, you realize that this could very well be the last time you see these 2 actors together.  One of them will surely die, perhaps both..... and this is just devastating.....Now, apparently in real life, Katherine Heigl has stated that she wants to come back to the show, while Knight has stayed quiet on the subject.  So it's very likely George will die and Izzie will make it.....but it would just be wonderful if they both make it.  It's a credit to the writing that after being fed up with one and indifferent to the other, I now desperately wish for their return.9.  Finally, the most amazing part of this season is that in watching events unfold and listening to Meredith's voice over in the season finale, you realize what a powerful lesson you are learning from the show.  We must tell the people we love how we feel, how important they are to us, how they have changed our lives; because everything can change in  a second.  I plan to do just that as soon as my husband walks in the door tonight.If this can be done by a TV show, then there is greatness in it.I am hooked all over again.
