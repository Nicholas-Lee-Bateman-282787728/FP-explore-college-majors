In reviewing Indian films, I often discover that those of that culture tend to believe those Indian films are great.  I think they are generally bad, and I have seen plenty.  To me, rarely are films from India good, including those Bollywood movies, with the exception of Satyajit Ray, a master director from India.Although this 2000 Bollywood film is much better than some I have seen, it still doesn't impress me.  The story focuses on a little girl abandoned as a baby and who was adopted to a family... a beautiful family at that, and she soon discovers this and is set on finding her birth mother.  The emotions are too fake. The subtitles don't go well either.  Who hears a child, the littlest boy, ask ..from whom?  Whom?The little girl, Amudha,  is very close to her father and we learn it was his intention to adopt her as a baby and then get married. At nine years of age, she is determined to meet her real mother.  So the family makes a trip to guerilla warfare territory of Sri Lanka.  The setting of explosions, ammunition, soldiers, bombs doesn't fit too well in this film.  It was overboard.  If you do not understand the plot on the war, then you may lose out on more of the film and not care.One lengthy Bollywood number; the music always sounds the same and fortunately, the dancing was limited.  Another Bollywood music scene was shortened.  Some of the dialogue was predictable such as the mother admonishing the daughter:  listen to your mother!  Daughter replies: You are not my mother!  Ok, how many times have we heard that.Surprisingly, in these Indian films, the parents can be abusive, hitting or slapping children, but rarely do we see parents actually kiss affectionately with one another.  The acting is ok, and not as bad as most films from India.  This is not a comedy whatsoever.Also, the film is distributed through Film Movement where they bring to us award winning independent film generally boasting good acting, good directing, etc.  This was a mediocre choice of Film Movement  .....

1071245,AK6DETJWUVME6,B000PHX4FQ,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","Saw this lovely movie with subtitles. I've watched a few south Indian films before and have generally been very impressed. It lacks the glamour and over-the-top-ness of mainstream Bollywood films and focus solely on raw human emotion and thought provoking storylines. This particular movie is excellent, one of my personal favorite south Indian films. The music is by the excellent A.R. Rahman and fits well with the story. The relationship of parent to child is portrayed in a realistic manner as opposed to being over the top or cheesy and overly mushy in nature. The acting is great as well. Would definitely recommend this for anyone interested in foreign films.",5,A Peck on the Cheek,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,666,"['Saw', 'lovely', 'movie', 'subtitles', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'few', 'south', 'Indian', 'films', 'have', 'generally', 'been', 'very', 'impressed', 'glamour', 'over-the-top-ness', 'mainstream', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'focus', 'solely', 'raw', 'human', 'emotion', 'thought', 'provoking', 'storylines', 'particular', 'movie', 'excellent', 'one', 'personal', 'favorite', 'south', 'Indian', 'films', 'music', 'excellent', 'A.R', 'Rahman', 'fits', 'well', 'story', 'relationship', 'parent', 'child', 'portrayed', 'realistic', 'manner', 'opposed', 'being', 'top', 'cheesy', 'overly', 'mushy', 'nature', 'acting', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'Would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'foreign', 'films']",A Peck on the Cheek
1071246,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000PHX4FQ,Artist & Author,"[24, 24]","The first thing that comes to my mind about this movie is the utterly realistic dynamics between each member of the family.  We have two adopted daughters, and little Amudha acted and reacted in exactly the same manner as our daughters would under similar circumstances.  My wife, over and over, identified with Indra, the adoptive mother.  The movie accurately depicts not only the normal conflict as a young girl starts to try to change from finding her identity in her mother to creating her own separate identity.  It also accurately depicts the feelings of the mother when the adoptive daughter wants to prefer her birth mother.  For example, when they would get angry at my wife, our daughters would often assert that their 'real' mother wouldn't treat her like this.  The feeling of rejection is hard for an adoptive mother to experience, just as was the pain Indra felt when Amudha rejected her mom for her FANTASY of her birth mother.  The movie also depicts Indra finding solace at times like that in her husband's love for her.There is simply a dynamic between a father and daughter that cannot be duplicated between a mother and daughter.  This was clearly shown in this movie.  Amudha often ran to her dad for reassurance, protection and even guidance in exactly the same manner our daughters would run to me instead of their mother.  The love between father and daughter is so palpable one can almost touch it on screen.  And, that is as it should be as the father is (mostly unconsciously) teaching his daughter what to look for in a husband, and she is learning how to express her love for her future husband by (again, mostly unconsciously) 'practicing' love on her father.  One vibrant example in the movie occurred when they found a woman they thought was Amudha's birth mother.  Amudha literally hid behind her father, just peeking around him to look at this woman.  She sought even stronger emotional protection from her dad when the woman insisted that Amudha was not her daughter, in effect rejecting the little girl.Because the family dynamics are so accurately portrayed, the story itself becomes very real.  Because it takes place in Sri Lanka, where there has been war for twenty-five years, there are quite a few war and battle scenes.  [The highest Tamil leader was killed just two months before we watched this movie, effectively, according to the Sri Lankan government, ending the war.]  Other than some war scenes, there is no reason older children - who can follow subtitles - would not be able to watch it.  The ending is quite emotional, especially when Amudha gives her adoptive mother a peck on the cheek.Every adoptive family should watch this movie.  If one is starting with adoptive children, they would be able to see some very accurate adoptive family dynamics.  If one has older adoptive children, I am sure you will find many of the scenes quite familiar.  One that I can give would be this.  As Amudha is changing clothes in their Sri Lankan's host bedroom, she gets into a fight with her mother.  At that moment, all Amudha could think of was the emotional support she knew her father would give.  So, she scampers into the living room, where Dad is chatting with their host, completely forgetting that she is wearing only panties!  Her dad, wisely, instead of getting after her for being 'indecent' loves her up, and I am sure if the scene had been followed further, talked with her - that it is okay to for her to get mad at her mother, but she has to also listen to and obey her.I cannot imagine anyone who likes movies about families who would not absolutely love this one.  Also, with so many single parent movies, it is refreshing to see the different dynamics between a child and both parents.  I don't think that many people who watch this movie would come away feeling disappointed.  It is too bad that this is little Kannathil Muthamittal's only movie.",5,Utter Realistic (Adoptive) Family Dynamics,1248652800,"07 27, 2009",2009,3908,"['first', 'thing', 'mind', 'movie', 'utterly', 'realistic', 'dynamics', 'member', 'family', 'have', 'two', 'adopted', 'daughters', 'little', 'Amudha', 'acted', 'reacted', 'exactly', 'same', 'manner', 'daughters', 'would', 'similar', 'circumstances', 'My', 'wife', 'identified', 'Indra', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'movie', 'accurately', 'not', 'only', 'normal', 'conflict', 'young', 'girl', 'try', 'change', 'finding', 'identity', 'mother', 'creating', 'own', 'separate', 'identity', 'also', 'accurately', 'feelings', 'mother', 'when', 'adoptive', 'daughter', 'prefer', 'birth', 'mother', 'example', 'when', 'would', 'get', 'angry', 'wife', 'daughters', 'would', 'often', 'assert', ""'real"", 'mother', 'would', ""n't"", 'treat', 'feeling', 'rejection', 'hard', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'experience', 'just', 'was', 'pain', 'Indra', 'felt', 'when', 'Amudha', 'rejected', 'mom', 'FANTASY', 'birth', 'mother', 'movie', 'also', 'Indra', 'finding', 'solace', 'times', 'husband', 'love', 'her.There', 'simply', 'dynamic', 'father', 'daughter', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'duplicated', 'mother', 'daughter', 'was', 'clearly', 'shown', 'movie', 'Amudha', 'often', 'ran', 'dad', 'reassurance', 'protection', 'even', 'guidance', 'exactly', 'same', 'manner', 'daughters', 'would', 'run', 'instead', 'mother', 'love', 'father', 'daughter', 'so', 'palpable', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'touch', 'screen', 'should', 'be', 'father', 'mostly', 'unconsciously', 'teaching', 'daughter', 'what', 'look', 'husband', 'learning', 'how', 'express', 'love', 'future', 'husband', 'again', 'mostly', 'unconsciously', ""'practicing"", 'love', 'father', 'One', 'vibrant', 'example', 'movie', 'occurred', 'when', 'found', 'woman', 'thought', 'was', 'Amudha', 'birth', 'mother', 'Amudha', 'literally', 'hid', 'father', 'just', 'peeking', 'around', 'look', 'woman', 'sought', 'even', 'stronger', 'emotional', 'protection', 'dad', 'when', 'woman', 'insisted', 'Amudha', 'was', 'not', 'daughter', 'effect', 'rejecting', 'little', 'girl.Because', 'family', 'dynamics', 'are', 'so', 'accurately', 'portrayed', 'story', 'very', 'real', 'place', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'where', 'been', 'war', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'war', 'battle', 'scenes', '[', 'highest', 'Tamil', 'leader', 'was', 'killed', 'just', 'two', 'months', 'watched', 'movie', 'effectively', 'according', 'Sri', 'Lankan', 'government', 'ending', 'war', 'Other', 'war', 'scenes', 'reason', 'older', 'children', 'who', 'can', 'follow', 'subtitles', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'ending', 'quite', 'emotional', 'especially', 'when', 'Amudha', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'peck', 'cheek.Every', 'adoptive', 'family', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'one', 'starting', 'adoptive', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'very', 'accurate', 'adoptive', 'family', 'dynamics', 'one', 'older', 'adoptive', 'children', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'find', 'many', 'scenes', 'quite', 'familiar', 'One', 'can', 'give', 'would', 'be', 'Amudha', 'changing', 'clothes', 'Sri', 'Lankan', 'host', 'bedroom', 'fight', 'mother', 'moment', 'Amudha', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'emotional', 'support', 'knew', 'father', 'would', 'give', 'So', 'living', 'room', 'where', 'Dad', 'chatting', 'host', 'completely', 'forgetting', 'wearing', 'only', 'dad', 'wisely', 'instead', 'getting', 'being', ""'indecent"", 'up', 'am', 'sure', 'scene', 'had', 'been', 'followed', 'further', 'talked', 'okay', 'get', 'mad', 'mother', 'also', 'listen', 'obey', 'her.I', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'who', 'movies', 'families', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'absolutely', 'love', 'one', 'Also', 'so', 'many', 'single', 'parent', 'movies', 'refreshing', 'see', 'different', 'dynamics', 'child', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'movie', 'would', 'come', 'away', 'feeling', 'disappointed', 'too', 'bad', 'little', 'Kannathil', 'Muthamittal', 'only', 'movie']",A Peck on the Cheek

Pfleeger,"[2, 2]",Mani Ratnam's Kannathil Muthamittal (A Peck on the Cheek) is an emotional journey for one adoptive family as they attemot to locate the birth mother of their daughter in war torn Sri Lanka.Nine year old Amudha (P.S.

The family dynamic is such that Amudha feels a closer bond with her father G. Thiruchelvan (Madhaven) then she does with her mother Indra (Simran). Amudha becomes more and more interested in finding her biological mother Shyama (Nandita Das)leading the family on a journey of discovery to Sri Lanka.The film is beautifully photographed and well acted but suffers some in its timing and inclusion of a guerilla war plot that seems slightly over the top and not necessary to the films resolution.This is a fine addition to the film movement catalogue and is worth seeking out.,4,Emotional Indian Film,1258934400,"11 23, 2009",2009,919,"['Mani', 'Ratnam', 'Kannathil', 'Muthamittal', 'A', 'Peck', 'Cheek', 'emotional', 'journey', 'one', 'adoptive', 'family', 'attemot', 'locate', 'birth', 'mother', 'daughter', 'war', 'torn', 'Sri', 'Lanka.Nine', 'year', 'old', 'Amudha', 'P.S', 'Keerthana', 'precocious', 'child', 'who', 'ninth', 'birthday', 'wealthy', 'Indian', 'parents', 'are', 'not', 'biological', 'parents', 'family', 'dynamic', 'such', 'Amudha', 'closer', 'bond', 'father', 'G.', 'Thiruchelvan', 'Madhaven', 'then', 'mother', 'Indra', 'Simran', 'Amudha', 'more', 'more', 'interested', 'finding', 'biological', 'mother', 'Shyama', 'Nandita', 'Das', 'leading', 'family', 'journey', 'discovery', 'Sri', 'Lanka.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'well', 'acted', 'timing', 'inclusion', 'guerilla', 'war', 'plot', 'slightly', 'top', 'not', 'necessary', 'films', 'resolution.This', 'fine', 'addition', 'film', 'movement', 'catalogue', 'worth', 'seeking', 'out']",A Peck on the Cheek
