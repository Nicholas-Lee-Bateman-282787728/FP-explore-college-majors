Genre favorite Michael Biehn stars as our crowbar-wielding hero in THE VICTIM, his second outing as both writer and director. Unfortunately, the audience is the one true victim in all of this. THE VICTIM is a mess from the very beginning. The poorly scripted characters and dialog are far from believable, faults that become that much more apparent throughout the grossly overacted performances. When the awkward sex scenes and confusing flashbacks are also taken in to account, it becomes increasingly difficult to remain involved in the plot. The end credits only seem to confirm the cast and crew's half-serious tone, but this isn't clear at any other point in the film. While Biehn and Blanc show a definite appreciation for the genre, this creative team will require much more outside experience to shore up many of the flaws in production.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",2,The Victim,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,1079,"['Annie', 'Kyle', 'front', 'porch', 'deep', 'woods', 'being', 'chased', 'two', 'murderous', 'cops', 'stories', 'begin', 'change', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'up', 'Kyle', 'determine', 'real', 'victim', 'Genre', 'favorite', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'crowbar-wielding', 'hero', 'THE', 'VICTIM', 'second', 'outing', 'writer', 'director', 'Unfortunately', 'audience', 'one', 'true', 'victim', 'VICTIM', 'mess', 'very', 'beginning', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'characters', 'dialog', 'are', 'far', 'believable', 'faults', 'become', 'much', 'more', 'apparent', 'grossly', 'overacted', 'performances', 'When', 'awkward', 'sex', 'scenes', 'confusing', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'also', 'taken', 'account', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'remain', 'involved', 'plot', 'end', 'only', 'seem', 'confirm', 'cast', 'crew', 'half-serious', 'tone', ""n't"", 'clear', 'other', 'point', 'film', 'Biehn', 'Blanc', 'show', 'definite', 'appreciation', 'genre', 'creative', 'team', 'will', 'require', 'much', 'more', 'outside', 'experience', 'shore', 'up', 'many', 'flaws', 'production.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

1551039,A1YXGVAKHLCL26,B008DL4IA6,CryWolf854,"[1, 3]","Michael Biehn what the hell happened to your career?  I mean, seriously, bro, you were in Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, Tombstone, even The Seventh Sign, and now this?  Dude, if you're hoping for a Mickey Rourke comeback, doing D-level dreck like this is not the way to go.I should've known I was in serious trouble by the cheap looking title sequence as well as seeing Biehn's name listed four times.  Did you miss a credit?  Like, maybe scoring or make up or key grip?  But I'm a sucker for punishment, I guess so I went with it.  At $5, I might have just covered this movie's whole production value.So we have these two easy girls Annie (Jennifer Blanc-Biehn, yup the ultimate couch test: marrying the director) and Mary (Danielle Harris, Halloween, Urban Legend) who are out ""partying"" (ie: smoking dope and having sex) in the woods with two cops.  But when Mary is accidentally killed during sex, our two hot blooded lotharios scramble to coverup the crime and eliminating the only witness, Annie.  But Annie overhears this plan and makes good her escape.  She ends up at a lone cabin in the woods where Kyle (Biehn) is shunning the rest of the civilized world.  And this is where the fun is suppose to begin if this movie wasn't as bad as it was.Faults are plenty here.  The biggest one is casting.  Seriously, I don't know what strip club Biehn met Jennifer Blanc in but putting her in the leading roll was a travesty on your part.  She is no Sherry Moon.  This girl can't act; plain and simple.  At one point, she is lying on the floor of the cabin, sobbing as if somebody had just made her Sophie's Choice her children, yet when we see her face as she is wailing, not a single tear.  Not even her eyeliner is running.  Strike One.Which leads to character development.  First off, there is none.  All the main rolls here are as flat as the roads in Kanas.  And we all know that movies of this sort requires characters we are suppose to care for and would like to see come out stronger in the end.  They don't exist here.  Annie and Mary willingly put themselves in the situation.  And while Annie has just met one of the guys, this doesn't stop her from going down on this guy while Mary is having her thin, brittle little neck snapped.  Now, I'm no prude but how much can you like a character who does this?  Yes, I know that there are people like this out there in the world but that is why we usually find their stories being told on The First 48.  People rarely bat an eye when they go missing or turn up dead.  And Annie even winds up in Kyle's bed moments after coming back from trying to find Marry's body.  You would think that she would've learned her lesson but nope, not her.  Strike Two.The last straw here is the whole third act and the so called twist ending.  While violent as it is, since you haven't invested any personality into the characters, you really don't care that they are killed so there really is no payoff.  And the twist can be seen coming a mile away.  All in all, an epic fail.  Biehn, I hope you find your career again or, at least, a noble retirement.  Associating yourself with this so called Revitalized Grindhouse Filmmaking (as in, cheap movies with no redeeming reason to be made or seen by the masses) is not the way you want to go.  Avoid this or only watch it if you feel like you've done something so horrible that self torture is the only way to punish yourself.",1,"Calling It ""Horrible"" Is An Understatement",1354924800,"12 8, 2012",2012,3415,"['Michael', 'Biehn', 'what', 'hell', 'happened', 'career', 'mean', 'seriously', 'bro', 'were', 'Terminator', 'Aliens', 'Abyss', 'Tombstone', 'even', 'Seventh', 'Sign', 'now', 'Dude', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'comeback', 'doing', 'D-level', 'dreck', 'not', 'way', 'go.I', 'should', ""'ve"", 'known', 'was', 'serious', 'trouble', 'cheap', 'looking', 'title', 'sequence', 'as', 'well', 'seeing', 'Biehn', 'name', 'listed', 'four', 'times', 'Did', 'miss', 'credit', 'maybe', 'scoring', 'make', 'up', 'key', 'grip', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'punishment', 'guess', 'so', 'went', '5', 'might', 'have', 'just', 'covered', 'movie', 'whole', 'production', 'value.So', 'have', 'two', 'easy', 'girls', 'Annie', 'Jennifer', 'Blanc-Biehn', 'ultimate', 'couch', 'test', 'marrying', 'director', 'Mary', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'Halloween', 'Urban', 'Legend', 'who', 'are', 'partying', 'ie', 'smoking', 'dope', 'having', 'sex', 'woods', 'two', 'cops', 'when', 'Mary', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'sex', 'two', 'hot', 'blooded', 'lotharios', 'scramble', 'coverup', 'crime', 'eliminating', 'only', 'witness', 'Annie', 'Annie', 'plan', 'good', 'escape', 'up', 'lone', 'cabin', 'woods', 'where', 'Kyle', 'Biehn', 'shunning', 'rest', 'civilized', 'world', 'where', 'fun', 'suppose', 'begin', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'are', 'plenty', 'here', 'biggest', 'one', 'casting', 'Seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'strip', 'club', 'Biehn', 'met', 'Jennifer', 'Blanc', 'putting', 'leading', 'roll', 'was', 'travesty', 'part', 'Sherry', 'Moon', 'girl', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'plain', 'simple', 'one', 'point', 'lying', 'floor', 'cabin', 'sobbing', 'somebody', 'had', 'just', 'made', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'children', 'yet', 'when', 'see', 'face', 'wailing', 'not', 'single', 'tear', 'Not', 'even', 'eyeliner', 'running', 'Strike', 'One.Which', 'character', 'development', 'First', 'off', 'none', 'main', 'rolls', 'here', 'are', 'as', 'flat', 'roads', 'Kanas', 'know', 'movies', 'sort', 'characters', 'are', 'suppose', 'care', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'come', 'out', 'stronger', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'here', 'Annie', 'Mary', 'willingly', 'put', 'situation', 'Annie', 'just', 'met', 'one', 'guys', ""n't"", 'stop', 'going', 'down', 'guy', 'Mary', 'having', 'thin', 'brittle', 'little', 'neck', 'snapped', 'Now', ""'m"", 'prude', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'like', 'character', 'who', 'Yes', 'know', 'are', 'people', 'out', 'there', 'world', 'why', 'usually', 'find', 'stories', 'being', 'told', 'First', '48', 'People', 'rarely', 'bat', 'eye', 'when', 'go', 'missing', 'turn', 'up', 'dead', 'Annie', 'even', 'up', 'Kyle', 'bed', 'moments', 'coming', 'back', 'trying', 'find', 'Marry', 'body', 'would', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'lesson', 'nope', 'not', 'Strike', 'Two.The', 'last', 'straw', 'here', 'whole', 'third', 'act', 'so', 'called', 'twist', 'ending', 'violent', 'have', ""n't"", 'invested', 'personality', 'characters', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'are', 'killed', 'so', 'really', 'payoff', 'twist', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'epic', 'fail', 'Biehn', 'hope', 'find', 'career', 'again', 'least', 'noble', 'retirement', 'Associating', 'so', 'called', 'Revitalized', 'Grindhouse', 'Filmmaking', 'cheap', 'movies', 'redeeming', 'reason', 'be', 'made', 'seen', 'masses', 'not', 'way', 'want', 'go', 'Avoid', 'only', 'watch', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'done', 'something', 'so', 'horrible', 'self', 'torture', 'only', 'way', 'punish']",N/A
1551040,ALTXPRX8OSOJ7,B008DL4IA6,"C. Waters ""darth tater tot""","[0, 0]","First of all, i decided to check the reviews of this movie on Imdb.. I couldn't believe how many ""Biehn-fiends"" were there posing as forum members.  They might also have come onto this site ""caping"" as well.  Many of these people are crew members, or ""passionate fans"" of Micheal Biehn and his wife (Jennifer Blanc-Biehn).These ""said"" ""reviewers"" went to the Scare Fest were the screening of this movie premiered and were told once they left they should go on the forums and ""give their honest opinion"".  Some of these fans were even invited to be on the set of the movie while it was being filmed. Thus, how in the hell do you expect a bunch of biased zealots to 'GIVE AN HONEST OPINION'??""Capes"".. you really should stop.  The film will sell itself. Seriously. Some of us, will get so disgusted at such fraudulent tactics to the point where we probably don't want see the damn film.  Thanks to you.I did rent the movie found that it was half decent.  I did find the reviews from ""real people"" very helpful.  Thus, i knew what to expect from this movie.I will say the driving scenes last between 4-5 mins each.  the ones with flashbacks even longer.The sex? why?  Robert Rodriguez made his directorial debut w/$7,000 ""El Mariachi""?  and he never really included multiple, tawdry sex scenes. I don't know if this movie was targeted for the less than intelligent movie-goer, or just a bunch of horny people that want to see amateur porn.And another thing! Where the hell did the sex scene b/t Mike/Jennifer come from?  Did this chick get turned on by looking at her friend's bracelet? or just getting yelled at by Kyle? It didn't fit in the screenplay, if it did? it could have come much later - or after she took a shower, for gawd's sake.Mike we ladies know you're sexy - and that you can screw for a 54 year old.  Seriously?  Hell, man, you've been in Hollywood like, ""since birth"" almost, and trust me, by the time you make that age in THAT neck of the woods? - you SHOULD know how to screw for a 54 year old.  (55 in real life).It's very obvious that you 2 are proud of each others bodies, and sexual prowess.  With each other - as well as multiple people, it shows.  But we, as the public, don't need to know that.You've worked with Robert Rodriguez as well as Quentin Tarentino in a true grind house flick. Even in one movie: ""Grind House Planet Terror""- yes, you were there - they show the 2 actors at the beginning of a love scene - then leave the rest to the audiences imagination.We didn't have to see Rosie McGowan's MAMMORY'S dangling in front of the camera. Or the constant fellatio simulation with other actors.  All viewers are not about ""that life""..I guess there's a little bit of something for everyone in this movie?  Not bad for $800,000.Oh, and one more thing?  Hypocrisy runs rampant in Hollywood.  I watched the ""behind the scenes"" footage. I wasn't shocked at how Mike and Jennifer were bellowing/ranting at the crew during this project.  Yet, when Christian Bale ""went off"" while filming ""Terminator""?  Guess who wanted to look cool for an interview, and said: ""It's just role, it's not that serious"".. the same guy whom everyone watched yelling/screaming along with his devoted wife for a low budget 12 day vanity project.Here's an example of the wife.  One of the actors was in a pit, obviously hurt.  She's SITTING at the edge of the pit gestures (her arm is extended into the camera next  to the pit) to the actor and demands: ""Will somebody help him???"".  Well, if you were that concerned, you would have gotten off your well-fed behind to help the man yourself.done reviewing.",2,"This film should sell itself.. no ""caping"" please?",1384041600,"11 10, 2013",2013,3607,"['First', 'i', 'decided', 'check', 'reviews', 'movie', 'Imdb..', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'many', 'Biehn-fiends', 'were', 'there', 'posing', 'forum', 'members', 'might', 'also', 'have', 'come', 'site', 'caping', 'as', 'well', 'Many', 'people', 'are', 'crew', 'members', 'passionate', 'fans', 'Micheal', 'Biehn', 'wife', 'Jennifer', 'Blanc-Biehn', 'said', 'reviewers', 'went', 'Scare', 'Fest', 'were', 'screening', 'movie', 'premiered', 'were', 'told', 'once', 'left', 'should', 'go', 'forums', 'give', 'honest', 'opinion', 'fans', 'were', 'even', 'invited', 'be', 'set', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'filmed', 'Thus', 'how', 'hell', 'do', 'expect', 'bunch', 'biased', 'zealots', ""'GIVE"", 'AN', 'HONEST', 'OPINION', 'Capes', '..', 'really', 'should', 'stop', 'film', 'will', 'sell', 'Seriously', 'will', 'get', 'so', 'disgusted', 'such', 'fraudulent', 'tactics', 'point', 'where', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'damn', 'film', 'Thanks', 'you.I', 'did', 'rent', 'movie', 'found', 'was', 'half', 'decent', 'did', 'find', 'reviews', 'real', 'people', 'very', 'helpful', 'Thus', 'i', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'movie.I', 'will', 'say', 'driving', 'scenes', 'last', '4-5', 'mins', 'ones', 'flashbacks', 'even', 'longer.The', 'sex', 'why', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'made', 'directorial', 'debut', 'w/', '7,000', 'El', 'Mariachi', 'never', 'really', 'included', 'multiple', 'tawdry', 'sex', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'targeted', 'less', 'intelligent', 'movie-goer', 'just', 'bunch', 'horny', 'people', 'want', 'see', 'amateur', 'porn.And', 'thing', 'Where', 'hell', 'did', 'sex', 'scene', 'b/t', 'Mike/Jennifer', 'come', 'Did', 'chick', 'get', 'turned', 'looking', 'friend', 'bracelet', 'just', 'getting', 'yelled', 'Kyle', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'screenplay', 'did', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'much', 'later', 'took', 'shower', 'gawd', 'sake.Mike', 'ladies', 'know', ""'re"", 'sexy', 'can', 'screw', '54', 'year', 'old', 'Seriously', 'Hell', 'man', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Hollywood', 'birth', 'almost', 'trust', 'time', 'make', 'age', 'neck', 'woods', 'SHOULD', 'know', 'how', 'screw', '54', 'year', 'old', '55', 'real', 'life', '.It', 'very', 'obvious', '2', 'are', 'proud', 'others', 'bodies', 'sexual', 'prowess', 'other', 'as', 'well', 'multiple', 'people', 'public', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'know', 'that.You', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'as', 'well', 'Quentin', 'Tarentino', 'true', 'grind', 'house', 'flick', 'Even', 'one', 'movie', 'Grind', 'House', 'Planet', 'Terror', 'yes', 'were', 'show', '2', 'actors', 'beginning', 'love', 'scene', 'then', 'leave', 'rest', 'audiences', 'imagination.We', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'Rosie', 'McGowan', 'MAMMORY', 'dangling', 'front', 'camera', 'constant', 'fellatio', 'simulation', 'other', 'actors', 'viewers', 'are', 'not', 'life', '..I', 'guess', 'little', 'bit', 'something', 'everyone', 'movie', 'Not', 'bad', '800,000.Oh', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'Hypocrisy', 'rampant', 'Hollywood', 'watched', 'scenes', 'footage', 'was', ""n't"", 'shocked', 'how', 'Mike', 'Jennifer', 'were', 'bellowing/ranting', 'crew', 'project', 'when', 'Christian', 'Bale', 'went', 'off', 'filming', 'Terminator', 'Guess', 'who', 'wanted', 'look', 'cool', 'interview', 'said', 'just', 'role', 'not', 'serious', 'same', 'guy', 'whom', 'everyone', 'watched', 'yelling/screaming', 'along', 'devoted', 'wife', 'low', 'budget', '12', 'day', 'vanity', 'example', 'wife', 'One', 'actors', 'was', 'pit', 'obviously', 'hurt', 'SITTING', 'edge', 'pit', 'gestures', 'arm', 'extended', 'camera', 'pit', 'actor', 'demands', 'Will', 'somebody', 'help', 'Well', 'were', 'concerned', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'off', 'well-fed', 'help', 'man', 'yourself.done', 'reviewing']",N/A

I get you have a mortgage payment too, but this is record-settingly bad.Sadly, it had potential. I give it 2 stars for the plot overall and the fact that done with better acting and writing, could have been a great True Romance-esque film. It missed the mark by about 5 miles. The only thing that sucked more was the leading lady - literally and figuratively.I'm guessing he wrote, directed, produced and starred in this (as most of the cast also had about 5 jobs per) due to the fact no studio would have green-lighted this. And look at what crap they will go through with. This was so bad, they probably wanted no part of it.The writing is awful, the acting is minging (save for a few parts for Michael Biehn - the only ""real"" actor in the movie). The most amusement for me was the impromptu riff-tracking with my husband. I think the movie is a definite MST3K prime candidate.The leading lady is probably the worst actor I've ever seen in any movie. Ever. Period. Stick to make-up artist, Girl. I do not know for certain by any means, this is simply personal theory, but I got the feeling that some people in the movie may actually have been in some porn at some point. But it might be that the movie is about on par with what little porn I've seen. A lot of unnecessary sex with very strange timing. SPOILER ALERT- when the woman in the film is out looking for her dead friend's body to prove to Biehn that she's telling the truth, she suddenly goes into ""How old are you?"" ""You're pretty sexy for 54. I've always had a thing for older men"" And que unnecessarily gratuitous snogging in 3, 2... Seriously!? She's looking for her dead best friend's body!!! The one she saw murdered less than a few hours ago. And she's turned on by this how?! She later goes on to give a BJ in an effort to buy time before a man is planning to shoot her citing ""At least I'll get to do something I love doing"". (And considering Biehn's age is mentioned by another reviewer not unlike it is in the movie- I'm guessing the author of that review is the same woman).

1551046,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B008DL4IA6,Mark Turner,"[3, 5]","I used to think Michael Biehn was a pretty good actor. But then that was way back when he made THE TERMINATOR and a few other good flicks. Then for some reason he seemed to be around less and less in major motion pictures. In some cases this is a good thing. In his case it led to this film, THE VICTIM.Biehn wrote, co-produced, directed and stars in this film. From the looks of things he should choose just one of those objectives and work harder at it. The result of his wearing so many hats turns out to be a film that doesn't deliver much of anything.Two young strippers are off in the woods with two policemen, one of whom Mary (Danielle Harris) is dating. While having rough sex, the policeman accidentally snaps here neck. Calling his friend over they decide the best thing to do is bury the body and make sure the other girl Annie (Biehn's wife Jennifer Blanc-Biehn) is killed and buried too. Having overheard this she takes off through the woods.Annie gets as far as a lone cabin in the woods where Kyle (Biehn) lives. Somewhat of a hermit, he's there for solitude and to get his life back together. When she tells him her story he tried to convince her to call the other police. A little digging shows that this cop is high in the force and destined to be the next chief. The chance of her story being accepted as truth with no body to show isn't likely.Things go from bad to worse when the two policemen show at Kyle's door. He denies having seen anyone but they don't believe him. They leave, Annie thanks Kyle and of course they head to the bedroom. Why? Because in movies if you appreciate someone's help you immediately have sex with them.Eventually the police and Kyle with Annie along will have a confrontation to settle the matter at hand. The movie is more about getting to that stage of the game in act three and seeing what happens then and who comes out on top. There is one nice twist at the end but by that time you no longer care.The film takes forever to move from one point to the next. A 5 minute sequence of Kyle's driving is used to establish that he lives out in the boonies with no one around. Nice way to run the clock out. Getting from one point to the next involves dialogue that's both lame and pointless. At one point I thought I was watching an episode of WHO'S LINE IS IT where they play the game answer with a question. Back and forth it goes until someone can't come up with another question.Not only is the dialogue boring but the shoot itself lacks quite a bit. Using day for night, a technique where you shoot in daylight and use a blue filter to simulate night time, it's done so poorly that everything is blue, including the headlights of every car. Countless scenes of driving from one spot to another fill the time out in this film that feels like an utter waste of time watching.Not that Hollywood is known for being the center of morality in the world today, but the question that kept popping into my mind was why someone would feel comfortable directing their wife in nude scenes and simulating oral sex on another actor. If you wanted to do this in a personal sex tape (the thing to do these days it seems) fine. But why make a movie that centers around a slutty character and having your spouse fill that role? Only in Hollywood.There is nothing I can think of to recommend this film. What is supposed to be a thriller or suspense film offers little of either. It doesn't even offer a good revenge flick. In the extras Biehn tries to say the film is another grindhouse film. That phrase has gotten far too much usage of late and rather than paying tribute to films of that original genre is used instead for low budget low quality films. THE VICTIM is both of those things, low budget and low quality. Worse yet it's boring.

There's a scene in the movie when she's trying on a bathing suit & she looks pretty sexy, it was definitely the best 5 seconds of the entire flick. As far as the movie, i wonder with movies like these if when they're actually being made that the producers & directors actually think they're making a decent product. I doubt it. So we have our blonde character & Mary(danielle harris), they are strippers who've gone on a outdoor date with 2 local police deputies. Things go bad when blonde girls friend Mary leaves the campsite with one of the cops to have some intimate fun. Some people are calling this a rape, it was not a rape she was a willing participant. Apparently at some point during this session, the cop gets violent & accidently or intentionally kills Mary we never really get a clear picture of what happened because the assault was not shown. Cop calls his buddy who's back at campsite with blonde girl over to ask him what should now be done. Blonde girl overhears what happened & takes off fearing for her own life. She comes upon the cabin of Kyle, a recluse who's also an ex-con. He agree's to assist her so without giving away the entire movie i'll say that I was expecting much more from the movie, I was waiting for somekind of cliffhanger or something but it never happens. Blonde girl doesn't really act like someone who saw her best friend dead, at one point in the movie she blows everything off for some fun in the sack.

1551051,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B008DL4IA6,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[4, 7]","Veteran character actor Michael Biehn's directorial debut is a taunt, fast moving throwback to the thrillers of the 1970's  lovingly dubbed ""savage cinema."" It is raw, violent, full of sex and female nudity, yes it is gratuitous and joyously so. It is also an agreeable enough time waster that manages to avoid becoming offensive or repulsive.Said to have been inspired by his working with Robert Rodriguez on the movie Grindhouse, not necessarily inspired by grind house cinema as has been reported, this film has a low budget guerilla-style look to it that is fully appropriate given the material and adds to it's off white colorfulness. Shot in a speedily manner, eleven days with a budget of $800,000, Biehn's debut is surprisingly well manned.I went into this one knowing nothing about it except that Biehn starred in it and had directed it, and found myself pleasantly surprised with his skill behind the camera. Working with his wife, actress Jennifer Blanc, also a co-producer, I didn't even know that Biehn also wrote the script, which serves as the movie's weakest point.Blanc stars as Annie, a stripper cokehead who along with her best friend Mary (Danielle Harris) are partying with a couple of local cops when things go a little sour, to say the least. Mary ends up dead, the victim of the title, and the officers pursue Annie. She finds refuge with Kyle (Biehn), a recluse who lives alone in the woods and tries to avoid drawing any attention.Biehn is a strong presence, an actor who under different circumstances could have easily become a star and a Hollywood leading man, he dropped off the radar for a while, but thanks to Rodriguez's above mentioned movie he has resurfaced in some worthwhile projects and more high profile films. He adds a legitimacy to this movie and no doubt helped this film get a justifiably better release including dates at a number of film festivals and a brief theatrical run.His lovely wife Blanc does a fine job, but isn't overtly charismatic in the heroine role. Scream queen Harris is always a treat for fans of the genre, sadly she has little to do playing the title role. Mostly Harris' scenes are confined to badly edited, awkwardly placed and poorly written flashbacks.Also the over all pacing is thrown off by the intrusive music on the soundtrack. Even at 83 minutes things do seem to run a little long. The camerawork is solid and it all comes to a satisfactory ending, even if it goes out on a plot twist that becomes apparent to the viewer long before it occurs to our protagonist. With a decent budget and a better script, Biehn could be a decent genre director, I will look forward to future movies from one of our most underrated actors, one who could have been a contender.Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",3,Pretty good for what it's ambitions are,1348704000,"09 27, 2012",2012,2780,"['Veteran', 'character', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'directorial', 'debut', 'taunt', 'fast', 'moving', 'throwback', 'thrillers', '1970', 'lovingly', 'dubbed', 'savage', 'cinema', 'raw', 'violent', 'full', 'sex', 'female', 'nudity', 'yes', 'gratuitous', 'joyously', 'so', 'also', 'agreeable', 'enough', 'time', 'waster', 'avoid', 'becoming', 'offensive', 'repulsive.Said', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'working', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'movie', 'Grindhouse', 'not', 'necessarily', 'inspired', 'grind', 'house', 'cinema', 'been', 'reported', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'guerilla-style', 'look', 'fully', 'appropriate', 'given', 'material', 'white', 'colorfulness', 'Shot', 'speedily', 'manner', 'eleven', 'days', 'budget', '800,000', 'Biehn', 'debut', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'manned.I', 'went', 'one', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'Biehn', 'starred', 'had', 'directed', 'found', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'skill', 'camera', 'Working', 'wife', 'actress', 'Jennifer', 'Blanc', 'also', 'co-producer', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'Biehn', 'also', 'wrote', 'script', 'movie', 'weakest', 'point.Blanc', 'stars', 'Annie', 'stripper', 'cokehead', 'who', 'best', 'friend', 'Mary', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'are', 'partying', 'couple', 'local', 'cops', 'when', 'things', 'go', 'little', 'sour', 'say', 'least', 'Mary', 'up', 'dead', 'victim', 'title', 'officers', 'pursue', 'Annie', 'refuge', 'Kyle', 'Biehn', 'recluse', 'who', 'alone', 'woods', 'tries', 'avoid', 'drawing', 'attention.Biehn', 'strong', 'presence', 'actor', 'who', 'different', 'circumstances', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'become', 'star', 'Hollywood', 'leading', 'man', 'dropped', 'off', 'radar', 'while', 'thanks', 'Rodriguez', 'above', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'resurfaced', 'worthwhile', 'projects', 'more', 'high', 'profile', 'films', 'legitimacy', 'movie', 'doubt', 'helped', 'film', 'get', 'justifiably', 'better', 'release', 'including', 'dates', 'number', 'film', 'festivals', 'brief', 'theatrical', 'run.His', 'lovely', 'wife', 'Blanc', 'fine', 'job', ""n't"", 'overtly', 'charismatic', 'heroine', 'role', 'Scream', 'queen', 'Harris', 'always', 'treat', 'fans', 'genre', 'sadly', 'little', 'do', 'playing', 'title', 'role', 'Mostly', 'Harris', 'scenes', 'are', 'confined', 'badly', 'edited', 'awkwardly', 'placed', 'poorly', 'written', 'flashbacks.Also', 'pacing', 'thrown', 'off', 'intrusive', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'Even', '83', 'minutes', 'things', 'do', 'seem', 'run', 'little', 'long', 'camerawork', 'solid', 'satisfactory', 'ending', 'even', 'out', 'plot', 'twist', 'apparent', 'viewer', 'long', 'protagonist', 'decent', 'budget', 'better', 'script', 'Biehn', 'could', 'be', 'decent', 'genre', 'director', 'will', 'look', 'forward', 'future', 'movies', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', 'one', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'contender.Check', 'reviews', 'moviezonemagazine.com']",N/A

Sub par story, crap acting and bad dialogue make ""The Victim"" a Victim of its own creator ultimately turning this into a bottom of the bin selection.Two stripper party girls (Jennifer Blanc an Danielle Harris) go out with two cops to party in the woods, one of them gets murdered for having a big mouth during a sexual encounter and both cops try to cover it up. Meanwhile the other girl gets away and eventually finds old Biehn in his secluded cabin in the woods and begs him for help which he reluctantly does.The acting is so bad that you can tell they're acting, it made me laugh more than anything. Daniel Harris really should have been the main girl and not the one who got murdered, in the end I think Jennifer Blanc got favoritism for being Biehns wife. ""The Victim"" is not really a horror movie and the one gore scene is actually botched when you see one victim's head smashed in with a rock in one scene than the next scene his head is just covered in blood and not smashed in anymore, too funny. If bad acting and editing mistakes were what they were aiming for, they hit it dead on.If you really want to see ""The Victim"" make sure you rent it, if you skipped ""The Victim"" you missed absolutely nothing worth watching.",2,"""The Victim Here Is You""",1353715200,"11 24, 2012",2012,1450,"['love', 'old', 'Micheal', 'Biehn', 'Aliens', 'Terminator', '2000', 'Biehn', 'definitely', 'game', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'acting', 'here', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'Divide', 'was', 'still', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'efforts', 'Sub', 'par', 'story', 'crap', 'acting', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'make', 'Victim', 'Victim', 'own', 'creator', 'ultimately', 'turning', 'bottom', 'bin', 'stripper', 'party', 'girls', 'Jennifer', 'Blanc', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'go', 'out', 'two', 'cops', 'party', 'woods', 'one', 'murdered', 'having', 'big', 'mouth', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'cops', 'try', 'cover', 'up', 'Meanwhile', 'other', 'girl', 'away', 'eventually', 'old', 'Biehn', 'secluded', 'cabin', 'woods', 'help', 'reluctantly', 'acting', 'so', 'bad', 'can', 'tell', ""'re"", 'acting', 'made', 'more', 'anything', 'Daniel', 'Harris', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'main', 'girl', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'got', 'murdered', 'end', 'think', 'Jennifer', 'Blanc', 'got', 'favoritism', 'being', 'Biehns', 'wife', 'Victim', 'not', 'really', 'horror', 'movie', 'one', 'gore', 'scene', 'actually', 'botched', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'victim', 'head', 'smashed', 'rock', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'scene', 'head', 'just', 'covered', 'blood', 'not', 'smashed', 'anymore', 'too', 'funny', 'bad', 'acting', 'editing', 'mistakes', 'were', 'what', 'were', 'aiming', 'hit', 'dead', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'Victim', 'make', 'sure', 'rent', 'skipped', 'Victim', 'missed', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

Mary (Danielle Harris) is killed during sex by Jim (Ryan Honey) semi-accidentally. The cops decide to kill Annie, who has overheard the conversation and escapes to a cabin occupied by Kyle (Michael Biehn, her real life husband), a man who seemingly has deeper issues than the movie lets on.The production moves into the abduction phase and uses flashbacks to build the girl's character. The questionable aspect as to the identity of the main character i.e. being a possible serial killer is hinted at, but never fully developed to where the audience knows with certainty. We are left with doubt as is Annie.I liked the soundtrack and background music used in the film. They didn't go cheap. When two girls listen to music that sounds like Katy Perry, you know they put out. The character of Kyle was too underdeveloped or under utilized, perhaps Michael was wanting to give more of the story to his wife and not turn this into an ego fest.PARENTAL GUIDE: f-bomb, sex, nudity (Jennifer Blanc-Biehn, the blond from ""The Divide"").",2,"JIM, SHE'S DEAD",1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,1213,"['Two', 'women', 'low', 'moral', 'fiber', 'Mary', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'Annie', 'Jennifer', 'Blanc-Biehn', 'go', 'out', 'date', 'woods', 'two', 'police', 'officers', 'Jim', 'Ryan', 'Honey', 'Cooger', 'Denny', 'Kirkwood', 'Mary', 'Danielle', 'Harris', 'killed', 'sex', 'Jim', 'Ryan', 'Honey', 'semi-accidentally', 'cops', 'decide', 'kill', 'Annie', 'who', 'overheard', 'conversation', 'cabin', 'occupied', 'Kyle', 'Michael', 'Biehn', 'real', 'life', 'husband', 'man', 'who', 'seemingly', 'deeper', 'issues', 'movie', 'on.The', 'production', 'moves', 'abduction', 'phase', 'flashbacks', 'build', 'girl', 'character', 'questionable', 'aspect', 'identity', 'main', 'character', 'i.e', 'being', 'possible', 'serial', 'killer', 'hinted', 'never', 'fully', 'developed', 'where', 'audience', 'certainty', 'are', 'left', 'doubt', 'Annie.I', 'liked', 'soundtrack', 'background', 'music', 'used', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'cheap', 'When', 'two', 'girls', 'listen', 'music', 'Katy', 'Perry', 'know', 'put', 'out', 'character', 'Kyle', 'was', 'too', 'underdeveloped', 'utilized', 'perhaps', 'Michael', 'was', 'wanting', 'give', 'more', 'story', 'wife', 'not', 'turn', 'ego', 'fest.PARENTAL', 'GUIDE', 'f-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Jennifer', 'Blanc-Biehn', 'blond', 'Divide']",N/A

In this case, that person is Michael Biehn (""Terminator,"" ""Aliens"").Party girls Annie (Jennifer Blanc) and Mary (Danielle Harris) find themselves in a life and death situation.  Annie's life is put in jeopardy when she witnesses the rape and murder of her closest friend at the hands of two sheriff's deputies (Ryan Honey, Denny Kirkwood).  With her pursuers closing in, she stumbles across Kyle (Biehn), a recluse living in the middle of the woods.  A rugged loner, Kyle finds the stillness of the woods comforting.  He keeps civilization far away until a single knock on his door throws his solitary life into turmoil.This tawdry film attempts to emulate the grindhouse, exploitation flicks that used to flourish in pre-Disneyfied, 1970's Times Square movie houses.  Rated R, it is extremely violent and tough to watch.  Rape, murder, gunplay, assorted psychopaths, crooked cops, adult language, and cliches built on cliches abound.

This is yet again another movie that has no real substance but is fairly entertaining to watch. The acting is pretty bad and the dialog is not impressive but it does keep you watching till the end. There are a few twists but to me this was still predictable. I have seen worse and for a B-rate horror movie this was not the bad. There are some fairly graphic sexual scenes in this but nothing over the top so if that offends you I would avoid this. All that said it did keep me interested for the whole time.

1551057,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B008DL4IA6,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","It is said that ""The Victim"" is homage to grindhouse movies. Is that so? Despite the story that includes torture and murder, the film itself does not have enough amount of over-the-top violence or whatever makes the exploitation genre so fun. I hate to say this because I like Michael Biehn, star/writer/director of the movie, but ""The Victim"" is simply boring.Michael Biehn plays Kyle Limato, a reclusive man living alone in the woods. One night a terrified woman named Annie (Jennifer Blanc) arrives, screaming for help, saying that her friend Mary (Danielle Harris) was killed, and now she, a murder witness, is being chased by the murders, two sheriff's deputies.I'm not perfectly sure if the film's hammy acting, simple bare bone script and heavy-handed narrative including too frequent flashbacks and musings are all really intentional. I think genuine homage involves a touch of creativity, which ""The Victim"" doesn't seem to have. Or is this just another low-budget thriller striving for the cult status?I don't know.
