1578254,A3AZV05G93JUV4,B008Y1YJ90,90s Kid,"[0, 0]","I saw this film when it came out it theaters...3 times! It was on my Wish List for almost a year and when it finally released I bought it to add to my Blu-Ray collection, Section: Holiday, Sub-section: Christmas.This is one of my Top 5 Christmas films ever. It captures the Magic of Christmastime. I immediately identified with Arthur because we are very similar. I love Christmas as much as he does. It is the most magical time of the year to me and I have felt that way since I can remember. The lights, trees, carols, santa, elves, presents, snow, giving and receiving, gingerbread cookies, stockings, snowmen, skating and sledding, Christmas films, hot chocolate and being home for the holidays.There are about 12-15 Christmas movies I watch each and every year and I am proud to say that Arthur Christmas is now included :)I highly recommend Arthur Christmas for your home during the holiday season. It is a great film for the family to enjoy together.Also, it is nice to see how Santa gets around the world in one night. I still don't understand how he eats that many cookies - his metabolism must be extremely high!",5,Christmas Magic,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",2012,1122,"['saw', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', '3', 'times', 'was', 'Wish', 'List', 'almost', 'year', 'when', 'finally', 'released', 'bought', 'add', 'Blu-Ray', 'collection', 'Section', 'Holiday', 'Sub-section', 'Christmas.This', 'one', 'Top', '5', 'Christmas', 'films', 'ever', 'Magic', 'Christmastime', 'immediately', 'identified', 'Arthur', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'love', 'Christmas', 'as', 'much', 'most', 'magical', 'time', 'year', 'have', 'felt', 'way', 'can', 'remember', 'lights', 'trees', 'carols', 'santa', 'presents', 'snow', 'giving', 'receiving', 'gingerbread', 'cookies', 'stockings', 'snowmen', 'skating', 'sledding', 'Christmas', 'films', 'hot', 'chocolate', 'being', 'home', 'holidays.There', 'are', '12-15', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'watch', 'year', 'am', 'proud', 'say', 'Arthur', 'Christmas', 'now', 'included', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Arthur', 'Christmas', 'home', 'holiday', 'season', 'great', 'film', 'family', 'enjoy', 'together.Also', 'nice', 'see', 'how', 'Santa', 'world', 'one', 'night', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'many', 'cookies', 'metabolism', 'must', 'be', 'extremely', 'high']",N/A

Williams ""mikey's girl""","[0, 0]","This was a surprise because I'm the &#34;Christmas&#34; fanatic in the family, I can't get too much on every level, get that tree up by Thanksgiving, and it doesn't come down till Epiphany. My grandson, 4, introduced me to this and laughed his head off through most of it. I admit I needed to watch it twice before I was able to catch all the adorable asides and visual details that I missed with raucous grandchildren around.This was a labor or love, in the writing, the &#34;updated&#34; Christmas vs traditional Santa and Christmas, it has enormous heart and a poignancy that is never maudlin or contrived. There are so many layers of humor, memory-imagery, visual superlatives that I find I see or hear something new each time I see it. (Yes, I am one of those who can watch Christmas movies regardless of time of year).Of all the creatively handled characters, with their often broad accents, many British or Irish, my grandson adores the present-wrapping elf (Briony?) and I soon realised why. Although there are multiple themes and story lines many of the elves are given specific characteristics and mannerisms, but none as charming and endearing as the wrapping elf. Personally I found Grandsanta the most amusing, but then as an adult this character is one of the pivots between story lines and as such as an adult I found him an often hysterical connection.Very well made, and as I said, with such heart and warmth that one feels like they have been cuddled for 90 minutes with their own grandma in a nice comfy chair.",5,Surprisingly clever and has enormous warmth and heart,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,1529,"['was', 'surprise', ""'m"", '34', 'Christmas', '34', 'fanatic', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'much', 'level', 'get', 'tree', 'up', 'Thanksgiving', ""n't"", 'come', 'down', 'Epiphany', 'My', 'grandson', '4', 'introduced', 'laughed', 'head', 'most', 'admit', 'needed', 'watch', 'twice', 'was', 'able', 'catch', 'adorable', 'asides', 'visual', 'details', 'missed', 'raucous', 'grandchildren', 'around.This', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'writing', '34', 'updated', '34', 'Christmas', 'vs', 'traditional', 'Santa', 'Christmas', 'enormous', 'heart', 'poignancy', 'never', 'maudlin', 'contrived', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'layers', 'humor', 'memory-imagery', 'visual', 'superlatives', 'find', 'see', 'hear', 'something', 'new', 'time', 'see', 'Yes', 'am', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'watch', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'regardless', 'time', 'year', 'creatively', 'handled', 'characters', 'often', 'broad', 'accents', 'many', 'British', 'Irish', 'grandson', 'present-wrapping', 'elf', 'Briony', 'soon', 'realised', 'why', 'are', 'multiple', 'themes', 'story', 'lines', 'many', 'elves', 'are', 'given', 'specific', 'characteristics', 'mannerisms', 'none', 'charming', 'endearing', 'wrapping', 'elf', 'Personally', 'found', 'Grandsanta', 'most', 'amusing', 'then', 'adult', 'character', 'one', 'pivots', 'story', 'lines', 'as', 'such', 'adult', 'found', 'often', 'hysterical', 'connection.Very', 'well', 'made', 'said', 'such', 'heart', 'warmth', 'one', 'feels', 'have', 'been', 'cuddled', '90', 'minutes', 'own', 'grandma', 'nice', 'comfy', 'chair']",N/A

""Arthur Christmas"" explains it all. When a young British child named Gwen poses all these questions and asks for a particular gift for Christmas, the story of Arthur begins.Arthur is the second in line to be the next Santa. He works in the Christmas card division of a massive operation that exists on an equally massive spaceship that houses millions of elves and is quite simply perfect. Although on this night, the operation isn't perfect, there is one child that has been missed. Her gift has been lost in the shuffle. Gwen's bicycle was never delivered. So when Santa and Arthur's brother Steve decide that going back to deliver that one present, to that one child, isn't worth the risk of being detected or something going wrong, Arthur resorts to unorthodox measures to make sure that one child isn't disappointed when she wakes in the morning.""Arthur Christmas"" is an active science fiction technological fun house of events.

1578305,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B008Y1YJ90,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","In November  2011, the British/American 3D animated film ""Arthur Christmas"" was released in theaters.Produced by Aardman Animations and Sony Pictures Animation, the film was co-directed by Sarah Smith (""The Pirates! Band of Misfits"", The League of Gentlemen"", ""The Awful Truth"") and Bary Cook (director of ""Mulan"" and known for visual effects for Disney films such as ""Aladdin"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""The Rescuers Down Under"", ""Tron"") and a screenplay co-written by Smith and Peter Baynham (""Borat"", ""Bruno"", ""Hotel Transylvania"").The animated film would feature voice talent from stars such as as James McAvoy (""X-Men: First Class"", ""Wanted"", ""The Last King of Scotland""), Hugh Laurie (""House, M.D."", ""Stuart Little"", ""Monsters vs. Aliens""), Bill Nighy (""Love Actually"", ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1&#8243;, ""Hot Fuzz""), Jim Broadbent (""Moulin Rouge!"", ""Gangs of New York"", ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe""), Imelda Staunton (""Vera Drake"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""Chicken Run""), Ashley Jensen (""Ugly Betty"", ""Gnomeo & Juliet"", ""How to Train Your Dragon""), Marc Wooton (""Frequently Asked Questions  About Time Travel"", ""Cyberdelic""), Laura Linney (""The Truman Show"", ""Mystic River"", ""Primal Fear""), Eva Longoria (""Desperate Housewives"", ""The Sentinel""), Joan Cusack (""Working Girl"", ""Say Anything"", ""Toy Story 2 & 3&#8243;), Michael Palin (""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", ""Life of Brian"", ""The Meaning of Life"") and many more.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Arthur's Christmas"" is presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen.  ""Arthur's Christmas"" is presented in English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital plus an English - Audio Description Track.If you want the best audio quality, I recommend the Blu-ray release.But overall, the CG animation for ""Arthur Christmas"" by Aardman Animations is pretty much the best animated film that I have seen from the studio.  Textures are well-detailed, everything from the characters to background scenery is amazingly well-detailed and well-animated.  If anything, I had a feeling that this film would look even more incredible on Blu-ray.And as for the audio quality for ""Arthur Christmas"" is well-done as there are quite a number of action-paced segments that utilize the surround channels effectively.  But if you are an audiophile, definitely go lossless as the Blu-ray release of ""Arthur Christmas"" will have a much better and possibly immersive soundtrack.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Arthur's Christmas"" comes with the following special features:Un-wrapping Arthur Christmas - (13:27) Featuring interviews with the cast and crew of ""Arthur Christmas"".Progression Reels - (13:49) Featuring animators commentary and for the featured progression reels for ""Arthur Christmas Unwrapped"", ""Arthur's Office"", ""Grandsanta"", ""Invasion"", ""Trelew"".Elf Recruitment Video - (1:11) An animated video for elf recruitment (and a promotional for ""Arthur Christmas"").EXTRAS:""Arthur Christmas"" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to download the film to your computer or select Apple and Android devices and also stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.JUDGMENT CALL:When it comes to animated films with a Christmas theme, a lot of films that tend to feature Santa often become banal.  Rehashed storylines with predictable endings.  But for Aardman Animations, they wanted to do something different when it comes to an animated Christmas film.Many children often ask how Santa is able to deliver so many presents to people all around the world and what writers Peter Baynham and Sarah Smith did was to answer just that.Unlike other Santa-related films, ""Arthur Christmas"" shows us that there is a line of Claus' members from grandsanta that people are familiar with, when it comes to the sleigh and reindeer.  But now a new generation of Claus that use modern technology that allows them to cover a large area of the world with speed and efficiency.  And how the elves have a big part to play in the wrapping and delivery of the items to various homes.But what if technology goes awry?  In this case, technology doesn't account for one single present and that means a child will be missing out on her Christmas gift?It's a pretty interesting concept to deal with different means of delivering children's presents to various people and how technology comes into play for a modern Christmas storyline.And because of its story, it's an accessible Christmas animated film for both children and adults.  Children will no doubt love watching clumsy Arthur or even the adorable Elves, while adults will understand the concept of Santa retiring, Mrs. Claus wanting her husband to be home and literally pass the torch to their children and of course, Santa having a hard time facing reality that it is probably time to let his children become the next Santa, while he starts his new life becoming more of a husband.It's no doubt a modern tale, mixed in with the classic ""will Santa be able to deliver the presents in time"" storyline.The animation from Aardman Animation and Sony Pictures animation was magnificent.  This is probably the best CG animated film to focus on Christmas and as the animation and the artwork for this film is very detailed and well-done, the voice acting with its talented cast also should be commended but having this British/American collaboration worked very well and was impressed by how things were executed in terms of animation, storyline, voice acting and direction.  I was impressed!As for the DVD, picture and audio quality on DVD is very good, but if you are an audio or videophile, I recommend the Blu-ray release of ""Arthur Christmas"".  The DVD also comes with a few special features and for the most part, ""Arthur Christmas"" is a solid holiday release!Overall, ""Arthur Christmas"" is an animated film that parents will no doubt want to buy for the children to watch over Christmas vacation.It does have a PG-rating mainly for mild rude humor but for the most part, there is nothing terrible, nothing violent that will frighten children.  Granted, there is a scene where Arthur, Grandsanta and Bryony accidentally land in the African jungle and are chased by animals of the wild and there are times where Arthur tends to get himself in a wee bit of trouble (ie. trying to fly with the reindeer) or one scene (which is probably the rude scene of the film), when Steve accidentally delivers a toy to the wrong child and tries to take it back from the child.  This is probably the extend of anything that an be seen as frightening for very young children.  But outside of that, ""Arthur Christmas"" is the perfect Christmas animated film being released on Blu-ray or DVD for the family this year!""Arthur Christmas"" is a fun, adventurous and enjoyable Christmas animated film for the entire family!

The usual result is a painful attempt to update and make the old relevant.Arthur Christmas takes a different approach. Not only does it fully embrace modernity, but it acknowledges the contradictions between the old and the new.In fact it brings it front and center, giving us a story about three generations and a clash of ideologies. All wrapped round a central message that the method doesn't matter, just the end result.And it works. I'm not sure I'd go quite so far as to call it a Christmas classic, but it's really enjoyable. The anachronisms work for the story and it definitely has that seasonal feel.Of course it doesn't hurt that it's funny or that it has a brilliant British voice cast.

I am an American but am accustomed to British entertainment in movies, radio plays, and TV shows; I found it easy to watch, and got all the ""in"" jokes, I think.This movie is based on a family of Santas who have the hereditary title passed down through the male line of the family. The family is obviously intended not as an ideal family, but simply as a normal family with normal family dynamics that children in the UK would be familiar with. This makes it nicely accessible for them.The energy of the story is very good, the characterizations strong and funny, and the ideas engaging. Visuals outstanding. I embrace this movie's contribution to the Christmas movie canon.What didn't I like? All the elder Santas were very self-centered, and that was a little jarring (too much like ordinary people, sadly), and there was no concern for the fate of the reindeer team. Even in an animated film, I find carelessness toward animals disturbing. That I would change, for a fact, were I re-making this movie! It doesn't have to be saccharine, just some kind of reasonable sop to the conscience; children and adults both need that, I think.It still succeeds, though, even with the perceived flaws.

There is the aging Santa who cannot quite grok that it's time for someone else to take the reins. There is the tech-savvy new heir apparent who does not get the recognition he deserves. And the screw-up with a big heart. Their Christmas is complicated by the fact of an undelivered toy, which brings out differing responses from each, and it's these reactions that make them quite human.It's fun to watch the elves on their commando-style operations to get toys to all the kids. And the animation is flawless. There is enough humor and heart to keep you hooked.But there are many stretches where you seem to be bombarded with non-stop noise, albeit a lot of it may be frantic dialogue. These stretches can be auditorily exhausting.Some bits can get tedious, trying to get to the point.The character design and texturing could have been much better. Grandpa Claus looks positively creepy, almost scary and out of place. The elves look rather bland and boring due to their huge, round faces and tiny, far-apart eyes.

The nation's economy has come to depend on the spending; in Britain, without Halloween or Thanksgiving to hold them back, they have decorations up by the end of October.  But, Christmas Is Threatened!Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!Okay.  So that's the idea.  The most likeable characters are British;  the least, the militaristic, gucci-suited erstwhile Santa-to-be is an American militarist.  The whole feature is soaked with an unfortunate militaristic air, we have no Draft so most Americans have no real tie to our overseas adventures;  we can bomb and pillage without any real risk to anybody who matters to most of us, so our culture is getting ever more militarized; kids play games killing people that some suggest are training for the future soldiers they might become.  And it takes over this movie giving what to me was an unwelcome flavor that ruined the film.Basically, beyond the militarism, it's a story of one kid getting missed, the system accidentally missing her toy (sort of like the basis for &#34;Brazil&#34; with less serious consequences).  Arthur, the Romantic Claus, a bumbler extreme is appalled that the kid is going to be averaged out and left without her toy, so he and Gramps---the retired Claus, get out the Old sleigh and reindeer and set off to do it the old fashioned way.They get lost.  It turns out that the Welsh town has its name in several global locations, including Mexico.  Things go wrong.  Gramps has an agenda.

I guess I'm in the minority.The beginning wasn't bad, but soon the story began unraveling. The whole sleigh ride to try to get to Gwen's house (the bulk of the film) was just one unfunny screw-up after another, including a ""joke"" showing a dog mounting a fluffy slipper. I don't mind adult-oriented jokes in children's films, but they at least need to be tasteful and funny! The worst was the reindeer getting hurt and lost during this whole mess, with no explanation as to their fate until the very end of the film. How could Santa (grandpa) leave his reindeer behind like they were disposable??! The UFO tangent was just plain stupid, with the end result being the sleigh gets blown to bits by the military. There were so many moments like that in the film that just took away from the story, without adding anything of substance or relevance. There was nothing gracious or magical to find here, like in the old Christmas classics provided by Rankin-Bass, where the story was clear and endearing, and at a pace that didn't make your head spin.I'd say buy an old Rankin-Bass classic instead, or Polar Express, or the Muppet Christmas Carol.",2,"Rankin-Bass, where are you!!?",1353888000,"11 26, 2012",2012,1248,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'film', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'just', 'meh', 'guess', ""'m"", 'minority.The', 'beginning', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'soon', 'story', 'began', 'unraveling', 'whole', 'sleigh', 'ride', 'try', 'get', 'Gwen', 'house', 'bulk', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'unfunny', 'screw-up', 'including', 'joke', 'showing', 'dog', 'mounting', 'fluffy', 'slipper', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'adult-oriented', 'jokes', 'children', 'films', 'least', 'need', 'be', 'tasteful', 'funny', 'worst', 'was', 'reindeer', 'getting', 'hurt', 'lost', 'whole', 'mess', 'explanation', 'fate', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'How', 'could', 'Santa', 'grandpa', 'leave', 'reindeer', 'were', 'disposable', 'UFO', 'tangent', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'end', 'result', 'being', 'sleigh', 'blown', 'bits', 'military', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'moments', 'film', 'just', 'took', 'away', 'story', 'adding', 'anything', 'substance', 'relevance', 'was', 'nothing', 'gracious', 'magical', 'find', 'here', 'old', 'Christmas', 'classics', 'provided', 'Rankin-Bass', 'where', 'story', 'was', 'clear', 'endearing', 'pace', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'head', 'spin.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'buy', 'old', 'Rankin-Bass', 'classic', 'instead', 'Polar', 'Express', 'Muppet', 'Christmas', 'Carol']",N/A

Arthur (Voiced by X-Men:First Class's and Gnomeo & Juliet's James McAvoy) is the youngest child of what is now the Santa 'Dynasty'. For generations Santa Claus's yearly duties have been passed down, apparently, from son to son. The next son in line for the current Santa (Voiced by Harry Potter's own Jim Broadbent) is supposed to be Steve (Voiced by the always surprising 'House' star Hugh Laurie who also played Dr. Cockroach in the animated Monster'Vs.'Aliens) - but both Steve and Santa has some real issues - the meaning of Christmas and what Santa really is all about!The basic plot - SPOILER ALERT - one child is 'missed' - quite by accident - on Christmas Eve. The movie has an excelletly clever opening with the S-1 Santa Sleigh showing you how Santa presently deliveries 2 Billion presents in one night all over the world. The gags, the jokes, the stunts these elves perform are amazingly clever and funny. The traveling concepts from the new ship to the reindeer are also inventive. Then the film does slows down a bit for the first third and was a little thick in Britishisms....but by the 2nd act and completely through the end the film gains a momentous heart! We learn the true meaning of Santa through Arhur and his grumpy yet strainght-to-the-point 'GrandSanta' (his Grandfather voiced by the ever changing voices of Pirates of the Carabbean's own Bill Nighy) There are some great magical dust gags and some hysterical pet moments as well as an incredible heart warming feeling build up that Christmas is not just Santa and presents but that it all comes from the heart - even Santa's.Also you should note some of the talents voices that also appear as the many Elves in the movie - they include Michael Palin, Robbie Coltrane, Joan Cusack, Andy Serkis and even Eva Longoria as the chief of the Military (yes the world wants to attack Santa because they think he's an alien invasion - that sequence is hysterical) and Laura Linney as the North Pole Computer Voice. An amazingly fun, family and entertaining film - especially for the kids - but adults will walk out with a tear in their eye. Really. In speaking with the production designer Soviet born Evgeni Tomov (who also did the animated film The Tales of Despereaux') and the director - this movie was not intended to be in 3D, but the Studio loved its process and it's production and decided this would be a good 3D addition to their film library.

1578390,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B008Y1YJ90,Marshall Lord,"[3, 3]","This review is based on taking my family to see ""Arthur Christmas"" in the cinema. It is an entertaining animated comedy about how the ""Santa Claus"" operation might be working in 2011 if it is a family business which is trying to move with the times ...The story begins as Gwen, a little girl in Cornwall, is posting a letter to Santa at the North Pole, asking for a bike for Christmas, and adding that she is the only one among all her friends who believes in him, quoting some of the arguments they use. Then we hear the voice of a the person in Santa's correspondence department at the North Pole who is replying to Gwen's letter, as the camera pans through a huge underground complex, beginning with a series of family portraits from the first Santa Claus (St Nicholas) through his descendants who have held the office to the present day: until we reach the office where Arthur, the younger son of the present Santa and the hero of the story, is writing the reply.Santa now delivers presents on Christmas night through a vast high-tech operation run like a benevolent army from a sci-fi film - I don't want to say too much more than this in order to avoid giving away some of the humour when you first see how it works. We are soon introduced to the amazing ""Claus"" family, of which the nominal head is the current, 20th Santa Claus (Malcolm, voiced by Jim Broadbent), who is just completing his 70th Christmas in the job.Other characters include his father ""Grandsanta"" voiced by Bill Nighy, who is now aged 136, and had been the 19th Santa Claus and misses the old ways of doing things: Santa's wife, Mrs Margaret Claus (Immelda Staunton) who is the family's unsung heroine; and his sons, Steve and Arthur, who could not be more different.Steve, who is obviously the architect of the current high-tech Christmas and appears to have been the effective head of the Santa operation for years, dresses and acts like a US Army General, is highly competent and desperate to succeed his father, but seems to have forgotten what Christmas is really about. Arthur is an idealistic, clumsy dreamer who has a knack for causing disasters, but who as much as any other member of the family really cares.Other characters in the Santa operation include a host of elves, particularly Steve's ADC Peter, who is so desperately keen to please that he comes over as a comic parody of a brown-noser, and Bryony, a determined and brave elf from the present-wrapping department who has a strong Scots accent.With two hours to go before dawn, Operation Christmas appears to be complete, with two billion presents delivered, the family and elves back at the North Pole preparing for bed - and then a parcel is found at the North Pole which had fallen off the conveyor belt. It's Gwen's bike - and the one child in her village who believes in Father Christmas is in danger of being the only child in the world who doesn't get a present from Santa this year!But not if Arthur can help it!As always, the Aardman animation is brilliant. The big name voice cast give of their best, and there is a lot of excellent humour.I did feel that the storyline was a little predictable and would have worked better as the plot for a film of about an hour's duration. At times the middle part of the film appeared to have been padded to fill the story out to an hour-and-a-half for a cinematic release.Nevertheless I can recommend this as an entertaining addition to the canon of family Christmas movies, which entertained me and more to the point, my children.",4,"Animated family Christmas comedy from the creators of ""Wallace and Gromit""",1325635200,"01 4, 2012",2012,3525,"['review', 'based', 'taking', 'family', 'see', 'Arthur', 'Christmas', 'cinema', 'entertaining', 'animated', 'comedy', 'how', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'operation', 'might', 'be', 'working', '2011', 'family', 'business', 'trying', 'move', 'times', 'story', 'Gwen', 'little', 'girl', 'Cornwall', 'posting', 'letter', 'Santa', 'North', 'Pole', 'asking', 'bike', 'Christmas', 'adding', 'only', 'one', 'friends', 'who', 'quoting', 'arguments', 'use', 'Then', 'hear', 'voice', 'person', 'Santa', 'correspondence', 'department', 'North', 'Pole', 'who', 'replying', 'Gwen', 'letter', 'camera', 'huge', 'underground', 'complex', 'beginning', 'series', 'family', 'portraits', 'first', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'St', 'Nicholas', 'descendants', 'who', 'have', 'held', 'office', 'present', 'day', 'reach', 'office', 'where', 'Arthur', 'younger', 'son', 'present', 'Santa', 'hero', 'story', 'writing', 'reply.Santa', 'now', 'presents', 'Christmas', 'night', 'vast', 'high-tech', 'operation', 'run', 'benevolent', 'army', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'order', 'avoid', 'giving', 'away', 'humour', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'how', 'are', 'soon', 'introduced', 'amazing', 'Claus', 'family', 'nominal', 'head', 'current', '20th', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Malcolm', 'voiced', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'who', 'just', 'completing', '70th', 'Christmas', 'job.Other', 'characters', 'include', 'father', 'Grandsanta', 'voiced', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'who', 'now', 'aged', '136', 'had', 'been', '19th', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'old', 'ways', 'doing', 'things', 'Santa', 'wife', 'Mrs', 'Margaret', 'Claus', 'Immelda', 'Staunton', 'who', 'family', 'unsung', 'heroine', 'sons', 'Steve', 'Arthur', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'different.Steve', 'who', 'obviously', 'architect', 'current', 'high-tech', 'Christmas', 'have', 'been', 'effective', 'head', 'Santa', 'operation', 'years', 'dresses', 'acts', 'US', 'Army', 'General', 'highly', 'competent', 'desperate', 'succeed', 'father', 'have', 'forgotten', 'what', 'Christmas', 'really', 'about', 'Arthur', 'idealistic', 'clumsy', 'dreamer', 'who', 'knack', 'causing', 'disasters', 'who', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'member', 'family', 'really', 'cares.Other', 'characters', 'Santa', 'operation', 'include', 'host', 'elves', 'particularly', 'Steve', 'ADC', 'Peter', 'who', 'so', 'desperately', 'keen', 'please', 'over', 'comic', 'parody', 'brown-noser', 'Bryony', 'determined', 'brave', 'present-wrapping', 'department', 'who', 'strong', 'Scots', 'accent.With', 'two', 'hours', 'go', 'dawn', 'Operation', 'Christmas', 'be', 'complete', 'two', 'billion', 'presents', 'delivered', 'family', 'back', 'North', 'Pole', 'preparing', 'bed', 'then', 'parcel', 'found', 'North', 'Pole', 'had', 'fallen', 'off', 'conveyor', 'belt', 'Gwen', 'bike', 'one', 'child', 'village', 'who', 'Father', 'Christmas', 'danger', 'being', 'only', 'child', 'world', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'present', 'Santa', 'year', 'not', 'Arthur', 'can', 'help', 'always', 'Aardman', 'animation', 'brilliant', 'big', 'name', 'voice', 'cast', 'give', 'best', 'lot', 'excellent', 'humour.I', 'did', 'feel', 'storyline', 'was', 'little', 'predictable', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'plot', 'film', 'hour', 'duration', 'times', 'middle', 'part', 'film', 'appeared', 'have', 'been', 'padded', 'fill', 'story', 'hour-and-a-half', 'cinematic', 'release.Nevertheless', 'can', 'recommend', 'entertaining', 'addition', 'canon', 'family', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'entertained', 'more', 'point', 'children']",N/A

Also there is no real &#34;villain&#34; in the movie, and nothing that will scare little kids out of their wits.

others.It is an ambitious animated film,and therein lies its' biggest fault;it is  TOO ambitious.The story is overly complicated and filled with gags that after a time fall completely flat.By the time you get to the end you don't care whether Arthur reaches his goal or not.The story revolves around the principal named character of Arthur who is one of the current Santa's sons.His other son Steve runs the control center and is boss over the elves.Steve has become quite ambitious and feels that he is the only rightful heir to becoming the new Santa this year.However when Santa arrives home he announces to one and all he is looking forward to going out next year,much to Steve's chagrin.Son Arthur is kind of the klutz of the family,who has had various jobs within the organization over the years,never settling into one very long.However this year he is Santa's official letter writer.Santa retires to bed,but it comes to Steve's attention that one present has been left undelivered.He tries to downplay it,even convincing his father not to pay attention to it.However Arthur gets wind of it,then Arthur's grandfather,who says he will help Arthur deliver that present in his old sleigh(Santa now uses an ultra sleek and cloaked spacecraft to do his work).Of course Arthur's grandfather has not ridden his sleigh for years and alot of mix ups and upsets occur at first.Eventually they end up stranded on a beach in Cuba as the sleigh circles the earth upside down with,by this time,only three reindeer.By this time most of the North Pole has come alive with the buzz about the undelivered present,embarrassing Steve ever the more.The elves even wake Santa up from his sleep,who confronts Steve and before you know it Santa,Mrs.Claus and Steve are winding their way to deliver the present(a better model of bicycle than Arthur has to deliver).Steve and company end up in the same spot in Mexico that Arthur had been to earlier.Their destination is a town in Cornwall,England and they must hurry before time runs out.Meanwhile Arthur has gained control of the sleigh,picked up his grandfather and they are in the town in Cornwall and attempting to get there with little time left.Arthur arrives just as the sun is peaking over the hills,threatening to wake up the girl the bike is destined for.Santa's ship arrives to block out the sun,which saves the day.Steve,Arthur,Santa and Santa's father invade the home to deliver the bike on time.Arthur asks his dad to stay and watch the girl open her present.It is then apparent by the look on Arthur's face,and his unflinching dedication,that HE should be the new Santa.The animation is quite detailed and very clear,which enhances its' entire look.But this film has just got so many little things going on,they become repetitive and unfunny.How many times does a sleigh have to over-turn to become unfunny?How many near misses does a sleigh have to have to become unfunny,despite the screams of its passengers?And Steve,Santa's own son,becomes a very unlikable character as the movie progresses.He becomes very ambitious,selfish and quite uncaring towards Christmas and children in general.We dislike him not only because of his off-putting personality,and his proclivity towards the modern,but because we expect more from a son of old Saint Nick.By the time the film ends,you can bet your children will be antsy in their seats and one does really not care whether Arthur delivers the present on time,as we have lost our vested interest in the proceedings a long time before.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include two featurettes and an elf recruitment vid.All in all,while the animation is good,the story,the gags and the characterizations leave alot to be desired.This movie will have the small fry squirming in their seats not too far into it.Not recommended.2 1/2-3 stars.",3,A disappointing animated effort,1352592000,"11 11,

Arthur is his youngest son and is a bit if a misfit helper. After a child is missed during the gift delivery, Arthur sets out to make sure she gets her present. This is a fun movie with excellent animation and very effective 3D. The characters are endearing without pandering too much to the child audience. It also provides children some insight into how Santa is able to deliver gifts to millions of children around the world.

I had assumed it would be standard, generically heartwarming Christmas fare. I wasn't at all prepared for what a delightful romp ARTHUR CHRISTMAS actually is. It has its share of heartwarming moments, but what truly impressed me was how non-generic these moments were. Instead, they were based in honest, human emotions, rather than manufactured Christmasy schmaltz. And even better than that, these moments appear side-by-side-and are even more often, merged-with a practically devilish sense of humor. This is an animated Christmas movie with razor-sharp intelligence and a real edge that works its own kind of Christmas magic while simultaneously undercutting the straightforward Christmas magic of other films (even as it paradoxically heightens it). Like a chocolate truffle sprinkled with sea salt, ARTHUR CHRISTMAS is as sweet as it is sharp.ARTHUR CHRISTMAS`s basic premise is that Santa Claus is not, in fact, the immortal, eternally senior citizen purveyor of presents that pop culture would have you believe but rather a title that is passed from generation to generation of the same family. The eponymous Arthur, voiced by James McAvoy, is the lovable screw-up son of the current Santa (Jim Broadbent). Arthur's heart is as large as his klutzy streak and he truly believes in the magic of Santa with all of his soul, something which can't be said for his older brother, Steve (Hugh Laurie), who-with his goatee impeccably trimmed into the shape of a Christmas tree-is corporate, hands-off efficiency personified and heir apparent for the Santa throne, despite the fact that he doesn't like children very much. Thanks to his guidance, the traditional sleigh has been replaced by a spaceship, the S1, loaded with the latest technology and filled with thousands upon thousands of elves, who take care of delivering the gifts to all of the houses with espionage-like perfection while the getting-on-in-years Santa stands by as the company figurehead, taking credit for all of the hard work.But as impressive as all of Steve's glossy new tech is, it doesn't prevent a regrettable mishap: in all of the world, one child is left behind when her present fails to be delivered. While Steve considers that an acceptable loss, hardly a blemish on his gleaming record, Arthur and his ancient Grandsanta (Bill Nighy) refuse to ruin this child's magical day and so, armed with the old sleigh, a group of actual magic reindeer, and Byrony, an enterprising young elf from the Giftwrap Battalion with a never-say-die attitude and a punk sense of style (voiced by the wonderful Ashley Jensen, best known from UGLY BETTY and EXTRAS), they set out to set things right. And while the overall trajectory of the narrative shouldn't be a major surprise to anyone, the delight is in the details. The movie rockets along with a sense of creativity and inventiveness-and often sidesplitting humor-that far outweighs any of its predictable elements, and even those are delivered with such genuine emotion that ARTHUR CHRISTMAS never feels anything less than the most fun, high-spirited, imaginative Christmas movie ever.",5,"Wonderful, extremely clever treat!",1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,3170,"['watched', 'ARTHUR', 'CHRISTMAS', 'only', 'vaguest', 'expectations', 'had', 'assumed', 'would', 'be', 'standard', 'generically', 'heartwarming', 'Christmas', 'fare', 'was', ""n't"", 'prepared', 'what', 'delightful', 'romp', 'ARTHUR', 'CHRISTMAS', 'actually', 'share', 'heartwarming', 'moments', 'what', 'truly', 'impressed', 'was', 'how', 'non-generic', 'moments', 'were', 'Instead', 'were', 'based', 'honest', 'human', 'emotions', 'rather', 'manufactured', 'Christmasy', 'schmaltz', 'even', 'better', 'moments', 'appear', 'side-by-side-and', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'often', 'merged-with', 'practically', 'devilish', 'sense', 'humor', 'animated', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'razor-sharp', 'intelligence', 'real', 'edge', 'own', 'kind', 'Christmas', 'magic', 'simultaneously', 'undercutting', 'straightforward', 'Christmas', 'magic', 'other', 'films', 'even', 'paradoxically', 'chocolate', 'truffle', 'sprinkled', 'sea', 'salt', 'ARTHUR', 'CHRISTMAS', 'as', 'sweet', 'sharp.ARTHUR', 'CHRISTMAS', 's', 'basic', 'premise', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'not', 'fact', 'immortal', 'eternally', 'senior', 'citizen', 'purveyor', 'presents', 'pop', 'culture', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'rather', 'title', 'passed', 'generation', 'generation', 'same', 'family', 'eponymous', 'Arthur', 'voiced', 'James', 'McAvoy', 'lovable', 'screw-up', 'son', 'current', 'Santa', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Arthur', 'heart', 'as', 'large', 'klutzy', 'streak', 'truly', 'magic', 'Santa', 'soul', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'older', 'brother', 'Steve', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'who-with', 'goatee', 'impeccably', 'trimmed', 'shape', 'Christmas', 'tree-is', 'corporate', 'hands-off', 'efficiency', 'personified', 'heir', 'apparent', 'Santa', 'throne', 'fact', ""n't"", 'like', 'children', 'very', 'much', 'Thanks', 'guidance', 'traditional', 'sleigh', 'been', 'replaced', 'spaceship', 'S1', 'loaded', 'latest', 'technology', 'filled', 'thousands', 'thousands', 'elves', 'who', 'take', 'care', 'delivering', 'gifts', 'houses', 'espionage-like', 'perfection', 'getting-on-in-years', 'Santa', 'stands', 'company', 'figurehead', 'taking', 'credit', 'hard', 'work.But', 'as', 'impressive', 'Steve', 'glossy', 'new', 'tech', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'regrettable', 'mishap', 'world', 'one', 'child', 'left', 'when', 'present', 'fails', 'be', 'delivered', 'Steve', 'acceptable', 'loss', 'hardly', 'blemish', 'gleaming', 'record', 'Arthur', 'ancient', 'Grandsanta', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'refuse', 'ruin', 'child', 'magical', 'day', 'so', 'armed', 'old', 'sleigh', 'group', 'actual', 'magic', 'reindeer', 'Byrony', 'enterprising', 'young', 'elf', 'Giftwrap', 'Battalion', 'never-say-die', 'attitude', 'punk', 'sense', 'style', 'voiced', 'wonderful', 'Ashley', 'Jensen', 'best', 'known', 'UGLY', 'BETTY', 'EXTRAS', 'set', 'out', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'overall', 'trajectory', 'narrative', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'major', 'surprise', 'anyone', 'delight', 'details', 'movie', 'along', 'sense', 'creativity', 'inventiveness-and', 'often', 'sidesplitting', 'humor-that', 'far', 'predictable', 'elements', 'even', 'are', 'delivered', 'such', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'ARTHUR', 'CHRISTMAS', 'never', 'anything', 'less', 'most', 'fun', 'high-spirited', 'imaginative', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'ever']",N/A

1578440,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B008Y1YJ90,Sheryl Fechter,"[12, 14]","""Operation: Santa Claus Is Coming To Town""... Is beautifully directed by Sarah Smith. She spins out a whole new animated theme of the Christmas scene, headed-up at and coming out of the North Pole.  What's first asked is: Just who is actually in charge up there?  It would be either the current Santa Claus (Jim Broadbent), who comes down through the generations with each Claus portrait hung on the wall, or the up-and-coming, heir-apparent, eldest son, Steve (Hugh Laurie).While the current Santa (usually awaiting a nap) is more of a position-holder up-north, Steve is in complete control with a militarily disciplined style. With the elves, and everything that needs doing, he's hyped for ""efficiency and productivity"".  The younger and kinder son, Arthur (James McAvoy), obviously operates from the heart. He's in charge of receiving all the letters to Santa and making sure the children are getting what they need; he believes that Santa is the ""Greatest Man Ever"".In a quaint town in England, little apple-cheeked Gwen slips her annual letter to Santa Claus into the post box with the highest of hopes. She begins an opening monologue asking a whole lot of questions about, and of, Santa Claus: ""Why?""-this and ""Why?""-that, including her doubts of whether or not he is even real.  Her friend told her otherwise while Gwen... Still Believes!We see an entirely orchestrated Christmas Eve night enfold... Steve is at the helm and in the complete direction of all 'operations'.  His father is Santa, and he's delivering the toys along with the new, high-tech elves ('1st. Field Elves Battalion'). Steve is choreographing everything behind the scenes, to the most minute of detail.  Upon Santa's return to the North Pole, following so much action, the counts are tallied and everything stands as... ""Mission Accomplished"".This is with the one exception. We soon discover, after Santa's family  finishes their Christmas meal around the table, that a child was forgotten.  That child just happens to be Gwen. She didn't receive her toy and she is still fast asleep.  Arthur is deeply disturbed by this, as he is the one who read her letter, and Santa's own father is also as upset with this situation.  Wisecracking Grandsanta (Bill Nighy) is old-school and came before this new, ultra-controlled way of handling Christmas and handling the children. He may be a lot of things, although he genuinely cares and also for Arthur's position as the 'Number Two Son' in the family. He misses the old ways and traditions held throughout his own generation of being the Head Claus.Arthur and Grandsanta join forces and switch back to the old sleigh  (endeared ""Evie"") and reindeer team in favor of this new, high-flying, techno-ride that Santa is using now. The two of them, along with an elf friend, take off to find the sleeping, and still believing, Gwen.  The race is on...There is plenty to see in this film with the animation and picture quality vividly done. The Christmas Eve scene at the very beginning is Hyperactive; with the elves in unison performing their tasks, jumping off of suspended ropes that seemingly hang from the sky, skiing all over, and viewing through green-glowing, night vision goggles. The North Pole is so well represented by color, light and hustling and bustling  everywhere. Even the dark blue night skies are blanketed in grand style, with a gorgeous mantle of shimmering stars. A truly happy Christmas movie that we enjoyed immensely!  Merry Arthur Christmas...",5,Yes Gwen ...

This one does not bring anything special or new or fun or mysterious or exciting like in many previous one. Moreover, the plot is loose, simple and even absurd.(so absurd that even my 8-year-old sister cried to leave the cinema) It's about the adventure to deliver a gift to a girl, the only one that the delivery system missed. But the adventure was so predictable and boring. I couldn't figure out why the director not think of anything more creative or interesting for the adventure. The plot also ruins the image of Santa Claus by portraying the fight for power in the Santa family. In addition to such bad plot, the expressions of characters are boring. It's like we have seen it a million times before. The same old song. I really hate the main character, quite clumsy and stupid. Maybe my most favorite character is the Grand Santa, who had a Gollum-like look and some fun quotes. But all in all, the characters also have nothing special.
