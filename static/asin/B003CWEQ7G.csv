Let me first say that the previews did not interest me at all. In fact I refused to see this at the theater but eventually agreed to order it on demand. This movie has some very funny lines in it. I'm one of these people that really appreciates funny lines in movies and often repeat them with the kids for days after the movie. I'd say Dwayne Johnson is just okay in the movie but I give him credit for his willingness to produce good family movies (there aren't many left).

It sadly misses a load of potential more often than not.You see, the plot doesn't actually develop around the fantasy adventures of a tooth fairy as much as the previews will lead you to believe.  Instead, for the first 30 minutes or so we see Dwayne Johnson's character going to some kind of fairy school, developing his wings, and being forced to go around the neighborhood collecting teeth underneath kids pillows.  So far, so good.  This makes sense.Many times he will receive urgent messages forcing him to go on tooth-collecting duty *immediately*.  When this happens, he has to stop whatever it is he's doing and go.  Sometimes he's forced to leave while in the middle of talking to his girlfriend and kids, and he doesn't want them finding out he's actually the tooth fairy, so some fairly amusing scenes take place involving Dwayne trying to cover up his growing wings and hiding in the kitchen and behind bushes.I was under the assumption the entire storyline would focus around THIS aspect, which is actually the most appealing way to write a storyline concerning a tooth fairy.  Apparently the movie writers believed otherwise, because then the story shifts in a completely different direction about halfway through and the entire fairy aspect seems to fall by the wayside in favor of Dwayne Johnson playing hockey and trying to concentrate on making goals.  What the heck??I realize hockey players frequently lose teeth while playing aggressively, but to be honest, hockey doesn't have *anything* to do with the entire fairy tale aspect of being a tooth fairy.  At least, not from a childs point of view (unless I missed something somewhere along the way).The writing is just mediocre and most of the jokes are too cheesy to really find any kind of humor in them, but hey, if you like watching the Mighty Ducks series, and enjoy lengthy scenes showing Dwayne turning into a father/husband and trying to win over his family's love, then by all means, check out Tooth Fairy.  Me?  I was expecting a heck of a lot more focus on humorous segments involving a tooth fairy delivering -or failing to deliver- teeth back to a fantasy world.

I've gotta say, he was pretty darn good in Tooth Fairy.Johnson plays Derek, a professional hockey player with the nickname `The Tooth Fairy' which he was given for knocking out so many teeth on the ice. It's more than annoying in movies like this, where we know the character will eventually become the tooth fairy, and for some reason they feel the need to previously deem him with a strictly on the nose nickname; kind of like Tim Allen's character Scott Calvin having the same initials as Santa Clause, if you will. But I'm not a child, so my point here is irrelevant.When Derek makes an un-wanted comment to his girlfriend's daughter about the tooth fairy not being real, he is sentenced to two weeks of `tooth fairy duty'. This sounds a little ridiculous, but we both know this film isn't aimed at you or me, but at the little ones. So looking at it from their point of view, it's on level with the plot of a great film like The Godfather or Saving Private Ryan, in comparison.Derek's girlfriend is played by Ashley Judd and the harbinger of Derek's two weeks of doom, is a head fairy of sorts, played by Julie Andrews. There are plenty of humorous shenanigans to be had with Derek trying to cover up the fact that he is a tooth fairy, between his girlfriend and her two kids; which is to be expected.While in `fairy land', Derek is met by a kind of Q character from the James Bond Franchise. His name is Jerry and he is played by none other, than the legendary Billy Crystal. Thank God he's back!

The Rock (yes I know he doesn't like being called that anymore) is mostly believable as a hockey player turned tooth fairy. There is some silly slapstick humor in this film, that is well meaning.Derek Thompson (Dwayne The Rock Johnson) is a down and out minor league hockey player that is nicknamed ""The Tooth Fairy."" He's an enforcer and knocked out a few teeth in his first season in the minor leagues. He is dating Carly (Ashley Judd - oh time has not been kind to her in this film) who has two children. One night while putting the youngest daughter to sleep, Derek let's slip that the tooth fairy doesn't exist. He is whisked away to tooth fairy land, headed by Julie Andrews, and given a two week punishment of being the tooth fairy. Billy Crystal has a nice cameo appearance.The reason I enjoyed this film so much, my fourteen year old son actually sat through the whole film and laughed a lot. I would guess this film works for younger children. There is a bit of the Christmas stories about this, believe and good things will happen. Maybe the film just struck some nice chords along the way.This film wins for the world's WORST and obvious product placements I've ever seen, how in the world Fender got hosed into supporting this film is beyond me. The boy plays a Fender guitar and Fender amp - that works just fine. But darn it, if there weren't Fender signs at the hockey arena. If this were Pepsi or Coca Cola, everyone would be up in arms for the product placements.The hockey shots were really juiced up too much, they looked a lot like The Mighty Ducks. The special effects were pretty well done, I believed when The Rock shrunk to three inches tall.This is a good for everyone film. There is no slimy double entendre humor that Disney seems to love to throw into their films. The humor is funny for all ages without excluding one age group. Mom and Dad won't have to explain some lame joke because it was over their child's head.Maybe I'm a bit biased; I'm a Rock and Ashley Judd fan.

This was a comedy?Derek Thompson (Dwayne Johnson) aka, THE tooth fairy, is a washed up hockey player who gets his kicks crushing the dreams, hopes, and aspirations of children.  He steals a dollar from his girlfriend's daughter then tells her there's no tooth fairy.  Everything has consequences and he soon finds himself on the bad side of the head tooth fairy, Lily (Julie Andrews).  His punishment, become a real tooth fairy for two weeks.  What follows is a spate of slapstick, tooth jokes, and a whole lot of nastiness on the part of this over-the-hill hockey player.Dwayne, as Derek, spends most of the film whining, pouting, and shouting while ginning like a psychotic lunatic at the oddest of times.  He looked like a maniac.  And let's not forget that he got his kicks from knocking out teeth and destroying the dreams of children; things he obviously enjoyed doing.  Worse.  Every time the audience is led to believe this repugnant idiot finally gets it and is about to be redeemed, he reoffends and does worse.

Neither is the movie.""The Tooth Fairy"" was directed by Michael Lembeck whose background has mostly be in TV except for ""The Santa Clause 2"" and ""The Santa Clause 3."" This is the story of the fall of the mighty ""The Rock"" from the WWE now known as Dwayne Johnson as he goes farther than he has ever gone before into Disneyfication. Formerly an action hero, he has recently been playing opposite the kids in ""Race to Witch Mountain"" and ""The Game Plan"" and now he puts on tights and frilly wings along with macho knee pads to be the Tooth Fairy.Dwayne Johnson's character, Derek Thompson was a former Major League Hockey Player that was dropped down to the minors and is still somewhat revered for his title as ""The Tooth Fairy"" for knocking out opponents' teeth. Annoyed by a lack of respect from fans and a new kid in the league with a bigger reputation than him already that he has to bodyguard, he makes some bad choices. After some bad parenting and almost blabbing to his daughter that the tooth fairy isn't real, Johnson is emasculated into a pink tutu with wings less than 12 minutes into the movie.The set-up feels a great deal like the beginning of the first ""The Santa Clause"" when Tim Allen tried to tell the truth about Santa Claus and got suckered into the job and got sent to a magical land with an elaborate set-up and a big map and people running around in wings and tulle dresses. The similarities are so ridiculous, it's just all been dressed up in a different fantasy character down to helping another fantastical character's career, bonding with a little boy, helping his own career, and fighting with the signficant other with mixed signals from the new job and let's not forget taking on this children's character role without choice. Even after losing the pink dress, Johnson is still in a satin blue top and tights and looks utterly ridiculous. It starts interfering with his life sprouting wings at inopportune times and embarrassing him as he struggles to keep the secret.Thank goodness for the continually magical voice of Julie Andrews entering the scene to give a better face to the Tooth Fairy community. Julie Andrew's hockey watching at the end of the movie got a laugh by using the trick in ""The Princess Diaries"" of bringing royalty down to the less regal level by yelling, ""Knock him on his bum!"" Billy Crystal steps in with a similar voice to the one he used as Miracle Max in ""The Princess Bride"" but terrible jokes. The cameo by Seth MacFarlane is funny but leaves the viewer asking why are you here? Ashley Judd as the girlfriend is kind of sad. She gets one funny sequence where Johnson gets to try out a series of apologies on her with forgetful dust inbetween but just phones in this role to get the check as do most everyone else in it. The assistant parole officer whatever, Tracy played by Stephen Merchant is ultimately creepy, especially when he smiles and should probably frighten small children more than make them smile.Dwayne Johnson luckily has gotten better at comedy and family movies over time, but that still doesn't make it good. By the time he straps on all his hockey equipment to get the job done, you won't be cheering because it's too little too late and Johnson will never seem like a tough guy again. The story and script are the real crime here and he gets through it as best as he can as if he doesn't realize how much it hurts his reputation. It just isn't funny when it is supposed to be and it's been too long since the first ""Santa Clause"" movie which also was just ok at best and this director didn't even do that one, just the sequels so why a repeat performance? ""The Tooth Fairy"" is an annoying movie, but it might keep the kids quiet and leave you alone for a little while. For a more magical evening, go back to ""Ella Enchanted"" or for the boys let them watch hockey with the first ""Mighty Ducks.""Bonus Features:On DVD, it is only the feature in Standard Definition with no extras, but I think the new format of DVD + Blu-Ray + Digital copy is the way of the future and a great way to integrate new technology into the ever changing market. On Blu-Ray, there is audio commentary with director, Michael Lembeck where he reveals that he used the same house for Ashley Judd as he did for Mrs. Clause in the ""Santa Clause"" (which just shows even more how unoriginal this whole movie was!!). He is utterly in love with Julie Andrews' motherly kind nature as he should be and continues to speak about all the effects that are visited in detail in another feature. Then he stops talking and starts watching the movie for long sequences which is something that happens easily in one person commentaries.There is a Tooth Fairy Training Center where children in pink and blue jammies do a cutesy 20 minute workout together complete with ""wing"" warm-up, sneaking past cats, and toothpaste squats interlaced with clips from the movie. I have to give the film props for a creative extra here that gets the kids off the couch!""Fairy-oke"" was something briefly mentioned in the story in Tooth Fairy land and here you can see what that scene would look like fleshed out to ""The Wind Beneath My Wings"" with winged microphones and you can follow the pixie dust fairy wand for the words and sing along. Gag Reel is your typical people laughing, smacking each other, and lots of wings hitting people in the face. In the deleted scenes, Johnson gets more time with the young hockey kid whose dreams he crushed in the beginning of the movie to turn things around and more time with Ashley Judd's son.Behind the Scenes of Tooth Fairy is a nearly 40 minute featurette introduced by the Director and Visual Effects Supervisor to talk about all the special effects used to make Julie Andrews and Dwayne Johnson fly along with all the other little magical sequences with fairy dust. They go into great detail about storyboarding and effects and how to shrink Dwayne Johnson, etc. presented in the driest manner possible.

1336902,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003CWEQ7G,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","I remember when Arnold Schwarzenegger would supplement his action flicks with the occasional comedy. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson probably needs to do the opposite. He's been doing so many kid comedies - or it seems like it - that he's in danger of losing his action hero credentials. Thank goodness, for the versatility of his film career, that FASTER is coming out soon. Meanwhile, TOOTH FAIRY will make the kids chortle. The grown-ups with them will just have to put up with it.The Rock plays a long-in-the-tooth ex-NHL hockey player who's been reduced to playing in the minor league. What he's still got is his pride and his swishy moniker. An enforcer with the reputation for knocking out his opponents' teeth, Derek Thompson is known as the Tooth Fairy (which, by the way, is a nickname I don't think a real hockey player would ever consent to be saddled with). But our guy has been known to yell in the rink: ""You can't handle the tooth!"" If you've seen THE GAME PLAN, then Derek Thompson will be familiar since he's cut from the same cocky mold as Joe Kingman. There's a bit of petty in Derek. His advice to one adoring kid fan: ""Lower your expectations. That's how you're gonna be happy.""One evening, while babysitting his girlfriend's daughter, a peevish Derek commits the bush league move of (almost) telling the little girl that tooth fairies don't exist. For his intent, Derek receives a summons from the Department of Dissemination of Disbelief. Turns out that magic does exist. As punishment for nearly dashing the dreams of a little girl, Derek is consigned to serve a two-week-long stint as an honest-to-gosh tooth fairy. Our hockey player would really rather not do this, but the tooth fairy godmother - as played by a steely, not-to-be-effed-with Julie Andrews - is impossible to disobey. When Derek attempts to give her lip, she cuts him off: ""You just interrupted me again while I was admonishing you for interrupting me."" And our guy is cowed. Off he goes, extracting teeth from under the pillows of sleeping tykes, armed with his dainty pouch heavy with invisibility sprays, shrinking pastes, and amnesia powders. Oh, the Rock.The film throws a crumb down the hockey fan's way by introducing a side story involving Derek's being tasked with protecting the Lansing Ice Wolves' newest star player on the ice. You can imagine how thrilled our dream dasher is. But this means that there are scenes devoted to hockey being played, and somewhere in there Derek comes to realize that he may not be as washed up as he thinks.It says something about how the Rock is so secure about his self-image that he allows people to dress him in tutus and feathery wings and pink slippers. Nowadays he's about as edgy as Carrie Underwood. Like I said, I'm glad FASTER is coming out soon. TOOTH FAIRY has its genuinely funny moments but they don't come often enough. The emotional beats feel really recycled. I guess the Hollywood power brokers still think that the masses haven't gotten fed up yet with a petulant Dwayne Johnson languishing in comedy land. The schmaltz arrives early and sets roots like a bad house guest. For a jerk, Derek eventually gets to bonding with just about everyone in the cast, including his girlfriend's surly son (who can improbably shred like Clapton) and with Tracy, his annoying tooth fairy case worker. It's all executed with the subtlety of a Superman punch. Ashley Judd and Julie Andrews are wasted. I won't even go into Billy Crystal (wasted - in fact, awful). If you want a premise like this done better, take a peek at THE SANTA CLAUSE. No, TOOTH FAIRY does not get a big boy pound. But the 10-and-under kids will eat it up.",3,"""I'm the Tooth Fairy.

I also have alot of kids who come over who are from strict families.  I would have no problem setting down and watching this film with them.  The moral of the story is don't be afraid to dream big because nothing is impossible.  I think it is good to have kids shoot for the stars so I really enjoyed this about the film.  Also, you do get to see the journey of the hockey tooth fairy turning into a real tooth fairy which is really enjoyable.  In addition to this though, you also get to see the journey of his guide trying to turn himself into a real tooth fairy.  I really enjoyed this part of the story, and I really did not expect this part of the plot.  I also found the different inventions that the Rock used as a tooth fairy to be unique and funny.

No.  Is this an indictment of a society which relies on consumerism and marketing to carry out our obligations?  No.  Do I have any idea what the prevous two questions actually mean?  Most definitely no.  This is, however, a movie in which a hockey player, Derek Thompson (Dwayne Johnson, he of the bulging muscles), dresses up in tights and a tutu and sprouts wings from his back.  In other words, it's a cute, inoffensive film, clearly meant to appeal to small children and those adults who can shut off their logical brains for a couple of hours, sit back and enjoy all the pretty colors.  While some of the dialogue is cringe-worthy and some of the moments of hilarity a bit forced, all-in-all it's never better or worse than what it set out to be.We get the familiar story of a man, Derek, who's bitter and selfish, who's had his dreams taken away and because of it, discourages those around him (read:  kids) from dreaming big, because all they'll get for their troubles is disappointment.  Even worse, Derek tells his girlfriend's kids that there is no such thing as a tooth fairy.  In retaliation, he gets a summons for Tooth Fairy duty.  Once it's beaten into his head that the summons (along with the above tights, tutu, and wings) is, in fact, not a dream, he becomes the worst tooth fairy in history.  It takes a severe dose of humility (provided by the always-lovely Julie Andrews) and a bit of ""I'll do it my way"" determination to reawaken the hope and magic hidden away in Derek.  The kids are happy, the romance is saved, and the big finale goes off with a bang.

Dwayne Johnson's conversion from wrestling in the  WWF to cinema never appealed to me.  Since the era of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Steve Reeves, muscle mass alone does not confer an edge on an actor lacking attractive facial appearance, strong personality, and believable expression. Johnson lacked those all. However, the theme of the movie fitted his lack of appeal and meager talent as an actor. I even doubt that Johnson was a good match to a Hockey player. He is tall and disproportionate for a sport that requires short stature and strong legs. In real life, Johnson would have been long gone had he played Hockey.By the moment, the movie started gaining appeal as its main theme became clear.  You could easily relate many people to the lack of appreciation of the essential role of nurturing fantasy in the development of children. The cold-hearted Hockey player led a dry life, where training and competition required objective and realistic planning.  Fantasy has no place in the routine life of an athlete.  Transforming his personal experience as a professional athlete into fitting in a family of two kids and single mom presented a challenge to his rigid and objective mind set.He was nicknamed the ""tooth fairy"" after busting the teeth of another Hockey player. In the family setup, the professional player could not relate to the children fantasy of hiding the tooth under the pillow, expecting the tooth fairy to sneak under the vial of the night to replace the tooth with money. The nicknamed ""tooth fairy"", instead, stole the money from under the pillow of the kid of his girlfriend unaware of its symbolic relevance to a child.In order to break the cold heartedness of a materialistic, rigid adult, he was enlisted, in his dreams, into the boot camp of the school of tooth fairies. His dreams fused with his consciousness.  He must work his way to develop sensibility and understanding of the role of fantasy in raising kids. The tooth fairy school was run by a seasoned Lady Chief tooth fairy. The cold-hearted Hockey player must learn how to fly with wings, vanish by swallowing paste, shrink by spraying magic powder, and turn people amnesic by aerosol sprayer.Every act of arrogant rigidity is penalized by further tooth-picking tasks that require flying, shrinking, vanishing, and altering the minds of others.The movie is a rich lesson in the psychoanalysis of learning how to appreciate the opposite and different views of different generations of human development.",5,A lesson in transforming cold-heartedness into sensible mindedness.,1264377600,"01 25, 2010",2010,2544,"['previews', 'movie', 'were', 'quite', 'discouraging', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'conversion', 'wrestling', 'WWF', 'cinema', 'never', 'appealed', 'era', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Steve', 'Reeves', 'muscle', 'mass', 'alone', 'not', 'confer', 'edge', 'actor', 'lacking', 'attractive', 'facial', 'appearance', 'strong', 'personality', 'believable', 'expression', 'Johnson', 'lacked', 'However', 'theme', 'movie', 'fitted', 'lack', 'appeal', 'meager', 'talent', 'actor', 'even', 'doubt', 'Johnson', 'was', 'good', 'match', 'Hockey', 'player', 'tall', 'disproportionate', 'sport', 'short', 'stature', 'strong', 'legs', 'real', 'life', 'Johnson', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'long', 'gone', 'had', 'played', 'Hockey.By', 'moment', 'movie', 'started', 'gaining', 'appeal', 'main', 'theme', 'became', 'clear', 'could', 'easily', 'relate', 'many', 'people', 'lack', 'appreciation', 'essential', 'role', 'nurturing', 'fantasy', 'development', 'children', 'cold-hearted', 'Hockey', 'player', 'led', 'dry', 'life', 'where', 'training', 'competition', 'required', 'objective', 'realistic', 'planning', 'Fantasy', 'place', 'routine', 'life', 'athlete', 'Transforming', 'personal', 'experience', 'professional', 'athlete', 'fitting', 'family', 'two', 'kids', 'single', 'mom', 'presented', 'challenge', 'rigid', 'objective', 'mind', 'set.He', 'was', 'nicknamed', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'busting', 'teeth', 'Hockey', 'player', 'family', 'setup', 'professional', 'player', 'could', 'not', 'relate', 'children', 'fantasy', 'hiding', 'tooth', 'pillow', 'expecting', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'sneak', 'vial', 'night', 'replace', 'tooth', 'money', 'nicknamed', 'fairy', 'instead', 'stole', 'money', 'pillow', 'kid', 'girlfriend', 'unaware', 'symbolic', 'relevance', 'child.In', 'order', 'break', 'cold', 'heartedness', 'materialistic', 'rigid', 'adult', 'was', 'enlisted', 'dreams', 'boot', 'camp', 'school', 'tooth', 'fairies', 'dreams', 'fused', 'consciousness', 'must', 'work', 'way', 'develop', 'sensibility', 'understanding', 'role', 'fantasy', 'raising', 'kids', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'school', 'was', 'run', 'seasoned', 'Lady', 'Chief', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'cold-hearted', 'Hockey', 'player', 'must', 'learn', 'how', 'fly', 'wings', 'vanish', 'swallowing', 'paste', 'shrink', 'spraying', 'magic', 'powder', 'turn', 'people', 'amnesic', 'aerosol', 'sprayer.Every', 'act', 'arrogant', 'rigidity', 'penalized', 'further', 'tooth-picking', 'tasks', 'require', 'flying', 'shrinking', 'vanishing', 'altering', 'minds', 'others.The', 'movie', 'rich', 'lesson', 'psychoanalysis', 'learning', 'how', 'appreciate', 'opposite', 'different', 'views', 'different', 'generations', 'human', 'development']",Tooth Fairy

Maybe I'm closer to my 2nd childhood than I thought but after seeing the previews a couple of years ago I've been trying to find this movie to rent or buy, but no matter where I've gone, the stores have been out of it. Damn disappointing, truth be told!I've had to be content with watching the previews and trailers over and over and over again, so imagine my delighted surprise when, halleluiah, lo' and behold, 'go tell it on the mountain!', one day I checked Amazon Video on Demand and there it was....THE TOOTH FAIRY!! WOOHOOO!Now I love Dwayne Johnson, no matter what he does (Game Plan: sweet and funny, Grid Iron Gang: a bittersweet tearjerker from the get-go...Rundown, Walking Tall, Scorpion King or Race to Witch Mountain). But Tooth Fairy...omg! It's hilarious!Dwayne's character, Derek Thompson, is a rather cynical minor league hockey player with a rep for bashing any opposing team's players so hard that he invariably knocks out a tooth...or teeth, earning him the nickname, ""The Tooth Fairy"". His cynicism gets him into trouble off the rink, though, when he almost destroys his girlfriend's little daughter's belief in the tooth fairy by stealing the dollar bill her mother left under her pillow and very nearly telling the little girl that the tooth fairy isn't real - of course 'mom' hastily interrupts and saves the day.Derek is an idol and role model to many little aspiring junior league hockey players...and he has a consistent habit of crushing their dreams with that subconscious bitterness he carries at being dropped from the major league, basically telling them that there will always be someone out there ""that's better than you; you'll never make it; just be happy with your mediocre little life"" (sic). Quite frankly, Derek is a jerk. A handsome jerk with a beautiful smile but a jerk nonetheless.One night, Derek finds a summons under his pillow that orders him to appear before the REAL tooth fairy. All of a sudden he ""sprouts wings and flies"", transported to the magical fairy realm, arriving in a pink tutu and ballerina slippers (REALLY?! ""The Rock"" in a tutu? PINK, no less?!!)...WHAAAT?...and from there the movie is just one hilarity after another as he fulfills his two week sentence of having to become a real tooth fairy and pay his debt for being a ""dream crusher"".Of course, at first he's miffed at the whole idea but, as is wont with a good movie, the lesson is there to be learned: get off your high horse, humble yourself, look around and help, rather than hinder, the people who look up to him. He slowly opens his eyes to his faults and actually sees the effect he has had on the innocent.It takes awhile, there are setbacks, but he eventually faces his own disappointments and comes to term with his life. In short, he has an ""Ebenezer moment"" when he unloads his excess baggage and becomes a great man.His short career as a real live tooth fairy comes full circle, from rebellion to grudging surrender, to enjoyment and all the way to embracing the magic.All from starting out in a pink tutu, Dwayne?That man looks good in anything!",5,The preview wasn't even the best part!!!  :),1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,3120,"['have', 'admit', ""'m"", 'old', 'Really', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'closer', '2nd', 'childhood', 'thought', 'seeing', 'previews', 'couple', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trying', 'find', 'movie', 'rent', 'buy', 'matter', 'where', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'stores', 'have', 'been', 'Damn', 'disappointing', 'truth', 'be', 'told', ""'ve"", 'had', 'be', 'content', 'watching', 'previews', 'trailers', 'over', 'again', 'so', 'imagine', 'delighted', 'surprise', 'when', 'halleluiah', 'lo', 'behold', 'tell', 'mountain', 'one', 'day', 'checked', 'Amazon', 'Video', 'Demand', 'was', '.THE', 'TOOTH', 'FAIRY', 'WOOHOOO', 'Now', 'love', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'matter', 'what', 'Game', 'Plan', 'sweet', 'funny', 'Grid', 'Iron', 'Gang', 'bittersweet', 'tearjerker', 'get-go', 'Rundown', 'Walking', 'Tall', 'Scorpion', 'King', 'Race', 'Witch', 'Mountain', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'omg', 'hilarious', 'Dwayne', 'character', 'Derek', 'Thompson', 'rather', 'cynical', 'minor', 'league', 'hockey', 'player', 'rep', 'bashing', 'opposing', 'team', 'players', 'so', 'hard', 'invariably', 'out', 'tooth', 'teeth', 'earning', 'nickname', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'cynicism', 'trouble', 'rink', 'though', 'when', 'almost', 'girlfriend', 'little', 'daughter', 'belief', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'stealing', 'dollar', 'bill', 'mother', 'left', 'pillow', 'very', 'nearly', 'telling', 'little', 'girl', 'fairy', ""n't"", 'real', 'course', ""'mom"", 'hastily', 'interrupts', 'day.Derek', 'idol', 'role', 'model', 'many', 'little', 'aspiring', 'junior', 'league', 'hockey', 'players', 'consistent', 'habit', 'crushing', 'dreams', 'subconscious', 'bitterness', 'being', 'dropped', 'major', 'league', 'basically', 'telling', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'someone', 'there', 'better', ""'ll"", 'never', 'make', 'just', 'be', 'happy', 'mediocre', 'little', 'life', 'sic', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'Derek', 'jerk', 'handsome', 'jerk', 'beautiful', 'smile', 'jerk', 'nonetheless.One', 'night', 'Derek', 'summons', 'pillow', 'orders', 'appear', 'REAL', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'sudden', 'sprouts', 'wings', 'flies', 'transported', 'magical', 'fairy', 'realm', 'arriving', 'pink', 'tutu', 'ballerina', 'slippers', 'REALLY', 'Rock', 'tutu', 'PINK', 'less', 'WHAAAT', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'hilarity', 'two', 'week', 'sentence', 'having', 'become', 'real', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'pay', 'debt', 'being', 'dream', 'crusher', '.Of', 'course', 'first', 'miffed', 'whole', 'idea', 'wont', 'good', 'movie', 'lesson', 'there', 'be', 'learned', 'get', 'high', 'horse', 'humble', 'look', 'help', 'rather', 'hinder', 'people', 'who', 'look', 'up', 'slowly', 'eyes', 'faults', 'actually', 'effect', 'had', 'innocent.It', 'awhile', 'are', 'setbacks', 'eventually', 'own', 'disappointments', 'term', 'life', 'short', 'Ebenezer', 'moment', 'when', 'excess', 'baggage', 'great', 'man.His', 'short', 'career', 'real', 'live', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'full', 'circle', 'rebellion', 'grudging', 'surrender', 'enjoyment', 'way', 'embracing', 'magic.All', 'starting', 'out', 'pink', 'tutu', 'Dwayne', 'man', 'good', 'anything']",Tooth Fairy

1336957,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B003CWEQ7G,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 1]","After watching ""Tooth Fairy"" most adults will wish they had a giant amnesia gun. Or a root canal. Whichever. Why the two star review, then? Younger children will probably find it somewhat amusing depending on their age. It's a movie full of weird situations, terrible jokes, and odd casting, but younger kids will eat it up. First things first: before you can even start watching the film, there are a lot of unbearable previews to get through, most for movies appearing to be worse than this one. The film gets off to a roaring start with Derek ""The Tooth Fairy"" Thompson (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) failing as a washed up former NHL player now playing for the Lansing Ice Wolves. He speaks of himself in the third person and has lots of awful lines like ""You can't handle the tooth!"" It's an exercise in punishing ego. Speaking of punishing, Derek lives to crush the dreams of children, giving lots of advice like ""lower your expectations."" He is a general jerk and is dating a nice woman, Carly (Ashley Judd,) who has two precocious and somewhat spoiled children, Tess (Destiny Grace Whitlock) and Randy (Chase Ellison,) who is unbearably mopey and self-doubting despite his obvious talents at the guitar.Because the film is called ""Tooth Fairy"" there are ridiculous plot developments which get Derek in trouble with the ""Department of Dissemination of Disbelief,"" where head fairy Julie Andrews (!) sentences Derek to two weeks as an actual tooth fairy to help promote the virtues of dreams and fantasy. Derek is assigned a caseworker, Tracy (Stephen Merchant,) who I found to be the most sympathetic character in the film. Tracy explains the history of fairy evolution, why he doesn't have wings but Derek does, and is the butt of numerous jokes, all bad (""My caseworker has wing envy!"") Julie Andrews has some anti-Leprechaun dialogue, and almost as if magically, chief of fairy logistics Billy Crystal (in a ponytail, and whose wife is a Leprechaun) demonstrates how to use amnesia dust, shrinking paste, ""Cat Away,"" and helps Derek learn to fly.While Derek copes with his new life with wings on his back (it's embarrassing to sprout them on a date) he quickly becomes proficient at retrieving teeth from sleeping children. Kids will in particular enjoy Derek's encounter with a cat while he's a couple of inches tall. (Adults may wish the cat was a better hunter.) Of course there are also numerous bits of physical comedy. (Does flushing yourself down a toilet ever seem like a viable means of escape?) The film proceeds slowly, and checks all the boxes in the required kid's movie plotpoint list. To take but one example, Randy is a surly but talented guitarist: Derek accompanies him on drums (!) and helps him have the confidence to win a very predictable talent show after alternatingly telling he's untalented and trying to raise his expectations in a plot that doesn't know what to do about character motivations. In the unsurprising climax, Derek learns that ""dreams are good for everyone"" and stages a major career comeback, landing him in the LA Kings lineup. Julie Andrews even shows up to cheer for him. I never thought I would hear her bellow ""Knock him on his bum!"" at the top of her lungs. Billy Crystal helps with the most unorthodox assist in the history of professional hockey, while the feel-good ending at the concert ties up all the loose strings in the most predictable manner imaginable.The entertainment is far from over, though. I would assert that the most amazing footage on the DVD is in the extras. The extras are mostly tedious, but there is one thing that will stay with you forever or scar you for life depending on your musical sensibilities. ""Tooth Fairy Training Center"" is a tooth fairy oriented workout video for kids, which is a good thing given how sedentary many children are today. There's also a standard trailer. And then there's....""Fairy-oke,"" a musical segment that will sear your brain. If you ever wanted to hear The Rock and a fairy (Tracy) sing a disturbing singalong duet of ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" while standing uncomfortably close to each other, you're in luck. I have heard a lot of outsider music in my life, but nothing since ""My Pal Foot Foot"" by The Shaggs has made such a sonically indelible impression on me; being able to watch the performance only serves to heighten the majesty of the material.""Tooth Fairy"" is silly and modestly fun like a kid's movie should be; in general, though, the script is an amalgam of groan-worthy jokes in a very formulaic plot that only very young children wouldn't find predictable down to the last twist. The odd casting is in and of itself mildly entertaining, and Johnson seems like a genuinely affable guy, but that's not enough to make this film worth your money. ""Tooth Fairy"" is harmless and inoffensive, but is not destined to be a children's classic.",2,"""No Need To Panic...It's Just A Giant Amnesia Gun!""",1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,4861,"['watching',
