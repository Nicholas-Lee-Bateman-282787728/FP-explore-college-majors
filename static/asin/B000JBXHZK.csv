The fireworks are going off and Rocco is playing and Kiefer announced the New Year. How cool would it have been to ring in the new year with Kiefer Sutherland? I'd be excstatic! Just watching it on TV eleven months later makes me grin.Of course, the famous tree climbing incident, which I've seen a gazillion times on youtube, is included in the movie.They travelled on regular airplanes, stayed in cheapest hotels, travelled in taxis (vs limos).

1025935,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000JBXHZK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[16, 21]","Men approaching a certain age sometimes take a moment to reflect on their life's progress.  Some may call it mid-life crisis and it can be typified by actions meant to keep one feeling young--the classic cliche's include buying a sports car or starting to date younger women.  Keifer Sutherland, however, takes things a step further.  He takes a wide-eyed interest in an unknown band and ostensibly becomes their road manager for a two week European tour.  This is the ground covered in the documentary ""I Trust You To Kill Me.""I'm not sure what the original intention of this documentary was, but it clearly becomes upstaged by Keifer Sutherland's participation.  But it was probably Sutherland's attachment that got the cameras rolling in the first place (and if not, certainly he is the name that secured a distribution deal for the film).  For the band is largely superfluous.  I suppose we spend some time with the lead singer, I know that music is his passion.  However, watching a film about an unknown band is not something I would typically do.  At the very least, I'd hoped to walk away with an incisive portrait of a group trying to break onto the scene.  Maybe I'd get a look at the artistic sacrifice or gain deep insight into what living for your music means--but not in ""I Trust You To Kill Me.""  Ultimately, this is a largely superficial peak at the actual musicians--and you watch the band politely while waiting to see what Sutherland will do next.Sutherland doesn't disappoint.  Inebriated for much of the tour, he is mostly there to use his name to help fill venues.  One stop in Iceland where he is interviewed by a local TV station--they ask about his last visit when he was written about continuously as a notorious partier.  That's not much of a stretch because this time around he manages to stumble about, loses his phone, loses his wallet, and in one hotel lobby--he hurls himself into a Christmas tree.  Needless to say, this professionalism eventually ends his connection to the band.  But he'll always remember Europe because he got one of their song titles tattooed in Icelandic covering his entire forearm.Amusing and somewhat sad, I recommend this only for those with an interest in the real Keifer.  At 39, he's still very much an overgrown boy who does what he wants.

It is about his foray into the music production business and focuses alot on one of his potential stars. I never realized that he partied so heavily.

He tries hard to hide pain bubbling within him.  With personal screen/TV success, Mr. K. Sutherland's inner turmoil has subsided, but will remain with him until he draws his last breath.  Yes, if you care to, you will see this in ""I trust You to Kill Me"".Kiefer tries to stay in the background wherever he and 'the band' go. Excellent band musicians, but, Mr. K. Sutherland has endeared himself to fans worldwide, not just by his ability and developed skills,  but by who he is inside his heart and spirit.  The band leader/vocal seems to resent Kiefer's fan adulation.When Kiefer accidentally hurts himself as a child, Kiefer's father laughs.  For a long time afterward, Kiefer deliberately hurts himself, hoping to entice 'accepting' laughter from his father.  Ending credits notes the band fired Kiefer Sutherland.
