It's very sad, no doubt but still deserves to be shown equally like any other film.Anyway, to get to the point, in spite of the fact Gene Hackman and Henry Thomas's characters are the essence of the story, I believe Henry Thomas and Huckleberry Fox hold this film together. The love between them; especially the hugging, always touches my heart. Their relationship is the kind of relationship all siblings across the world should have. As for the rest of the film, I get pissed off at Gene Hackman's character. Not allowing his sons to be with their mother when she's ill, not allowing them to go to their own mother's funeral, telling Andrew not to tell Miles his mother is gone, treating Andrew like someone who doesn't need nurturing when Andrew obviously does need it,taking the word of that selfish, inconsiderate, lying, unfair old hag Mrs. Paley against the word of his own children,. . . the man obviously has his head screwed on wrong. I believe he's totally dispicable!!Thank God for those two beautiful boys. Without them, there wouldn't be any film. Henry and Huckleberry, Andrew and Miles are two of a kind. I wish they'd done more films together.",5,Henry and Huckeberry rule the roost!,1277769600,"06 29, 2010",2010,1296,"['movie', 'be', 'banned', 'eveywhere', 'Banned', 'being', 'sold', 'stores', 'shown', 'television', 'so', 'forth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'very', 'sad', 'doubt', 'still', 'be', 'shown', 'equally', 'other', 'film.Anyway', 'get', 'point', 'spite', 'fact', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'characters', 'are', 'essence', 'story', 'believe', 'Henry', 'Thomas', 'Huckleberry', 'Fox', 'hold', 'film', 'together', 'love', 'especially', 'hugging', 'always', 'touches', 'heart', 'relationship', 'kind', 'relationship', 'siblings', 'world', 'should', 'have', 'rest', 'film', 'get', 'pissed', 'off', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'character', 'Not', 'allowing', 'sons', 'be', 'mother', 'when', 'ill', 'not', 'allowing', 'go', 'own', 'mother', 'funeral', 'telling', 'Andrew', 'not', 'tell', 'Miles', 'mother', 'gone', 'treating', 'Andrew', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'need', 'nurturing', 'when', 'Andrew', 'obviously', 'need', 'taking', 'word', 'selfish', 'inconsiderate', 'lying', 'unfair', 'old', 'hag', 'Mrs.', 'Paley', 'word', 'own', 'children', 'man', 'obviously', 'head', 'screwed', 'wrong', 'believe', 'totally', 'dispicable', 'Thank', 'God', 'two', 'beautiful', 'boys', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'film', 'Henry', 'Huckleberry', 'Andrew', 'Miles', 'are', 'two', 'kind', 'wish', ""'d"", 'done', 'more', 'films', 'together']",Misunderstood VHS

282845,A1432ACW6PZBH1,6301971914,"Jude ""Jude""","[0, 0]","The sadest thing about this movie is that although it is beyond excellent, it was apparently released in 2003 on VHS, but has yet to be released on DVD, in spite of many customers begging for it.Yes, it is a tearjerker, as life often is, but it is never maudlin, like many tearjerkers often are.  The plot is tight, story rings true, and the acting, as mentioned by others, is outstanding.I have long had it connected with another outstanding, but unavilable movie, staring Robert Duvall, in which he played a man living alone in a winter, sheep herder's mountain cabin.  A pregnant woman about to deliver her baby, and freezing to death, knocked on his door, and the story unfolds.  Can't even recall the name of that one (saw it on TV years ago), and as far as I've been able to discover, it's not even available on VHS, much less DVD.  It's not a tearjerker, per se, but the two are connected in my head because they both present sensitive dramas with outstanding performances by a limited cast.  They both fit Aristotle's ""prescription"" for good plays:  few characters, (none unessential to the story), and story taking place in one location, over a limited amount of time. They both leave one contemplating moral values, especially kindness.  As someone said, ""We pass this way but once.""  It is human to fail in our travels, but more importantly, it is equally (or more) human to strive to suceed.I'd also like to know, while on the missing movie subject, why Ayn Rand's ""We the Living"" has never been released in English.

Gene Hackman, who in my opinion is always superb, is somehow even better than ever.  Rip Torn does a wonderful job in a supporting role.
