838626,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0002KPHYM,Acute Observer,"[0, 2]","Pursuit, 1972 filmThe film begins at night with a countdown to 15 hours. An Army convoy halts on the road. Rapid fire kills the soldiers [a large force?]. A truck pulls alongside to load the contents. Next we see a political convention, then an airport with passengers. They watch a film of a political speaker decrying the establishment. It's a small organization that is supported by multi-millionaire James Wright. Federal investigators are on his trail. Who is copying classified governmental information via a computer? Timothy Drew posed as a computer repairman to gain access. Steve Graves wants more time to investigate Wright. They show scenes of San Diego, the planned site of the 1972 Republican Convention. We see cars from that era. Are the investigators following too close?Wright's big limousine goes to the industrial district and buys parts. They arrest Timothy Drew and question him. A deal is made. They watch Wright from another high-rise building. Would a psychiatrist tell about a patient? [Would undercover investigators keep using the same car?] What was an old wringer washing machine doing there? There is a fake example of the use of binary nerve gas. It could kill a million people! Could a double fool the investigators? [No seat belts in use.] They find Wright with two containers in an apartment. ""He did it."" Wright is arrested and questioned, he talks about what he did. [Does he sound sane?] ""Why?"" Can Wright escape? Can they disarm the bomb before 5PM?Steve has a plan to stop the bomb, there is an antidote for nerve gas. Will Steve be able to disarm the gas bomb in time? Was there a scheduled telephone call? Was there another hidden booby trap? A machine can detect the smell of plastic explosives. Will they disarm the bomb before it explodes? And so the Free World is saved by the actions of Federal investigators, again. This is an interesting story even if the premise seems unbelievable (multi-millionaire plans to kill millions). Don't they have a limousine health plan to treat mental illness?This was originally produced as a low-budget TV movie in 1972. The convention planned for San Diego was canceled, instead it was held in the same city as the other party's convention. The Watergate Burglary in June 1972 caused a scandal and President Nixon changed plans to please the broadcast media who didn't want the extra expense in covering another location. Did the broadcast media then downplay the Watergate Burglary? Yes, except for the `Washington Post'.

Michael Crichton had aprescience in his vision and this movie is no exception. Getting hungup on setting the movie ""in the future"" never presented a dilemma forCrichton. He just uses contemporary settings to bring the movie closerto home. The technology may be beyond our means, but it still affectsus all today.The movie stars brilliant and eclectic Ben Gazzara (""The Killing of aChinese Bookie"", ""The Big Lebowski""), Storied great E.G. Marshall (""12Angry Men"", ""Creepshow""), Prolific Martin Sheen (""Apocalypse Now"", ""TheDead Zone"") and Television guest star William Windom (""Star Trek: TheDoomsday Machine"", ""Escape from the Planet of The Apes"").The musical score is even composed by composer-great Jerry Goldsmith.The story revolves around a political activist-millionaire-terroristwho steals a large supply of nerve gas and threatens to release it inSan Diego, which is hosting the Republican National Convention.Sounds simple. The movie is really thrilling for a TV Movie, the storyhas a familiar contemporary feel, the acting and musical score aregood, although the acting has that ""understated 70s"" style to it.The movie was filmed in early 1970s San Diego and for anybody wholoves or lives in San Diego (like me), the movie is a great archivepiece to record how San Diego was 40 years ago. Much more watchablethan ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"".Could the movie have been better? Sure it could. It suffered fromlow-budget syndrome.

Then, while surfing through Amazon's recommendations based on my previous purchases (I had purchased Coma and The Great Train Robbery - both are good solid films directed by Crichton) I saw this. Due to the DVD case art I was expecting a great movie. I was unfortunately disappointed with both the acting and script. It almost makes me sad that Crichton, himself, directed this. The story is good and could make a great movie. This is one of those that I wished Hollywood would adapt and set in the present day.

Those would obviously include &#34;Brian's Song&#34;; &#34;The Night Stalker&#34; and its sequel, &#34;The Night Strangler&#34;; ...and &#34;Pursuit&#34;.I remember being impressed enough with the movie that I went looking for the book by &#34;John Lange&#34; (really Michael Crichton).  The book certainly has a better name -- &#34;Binary&#34; -- and despite the fact that it's a fast read, it's more detailed and intense.  The movie made from it is suspenseful enough, though.  The plot involves a cat-and-mouse game between a driven intelligence agent and his quarry, an extremist millionaire hatching a deadly plot.  As the film begins, and throughout, we see a running countdown clock...although for quite a while we don't know what it's counting down toward.  It turns out that the millionaire fanatic has much, much bigger plans than just a simple bomb or an assassination, though it's up to the intelligence agent, Steven Graves, to figure out just what it is the madman is up to.  And even when Graves has figured it out, it looks like there may be no way to stop it.I found the acting adequate, by several familiar 1970s TV faces, including Ben Gazzara, William Windom, E. G. Marshall and Martin Sheen.  But this is a puzzle mystery, and by its nature that sort of limits the acting range to things like Marshall's smug vanity and Gazzara's intensity and frustration.The movie transfer is poor and looks muddy.  Better than an old VHS tape I had of this movie, but not by much.  To my surprise, there are captions, however, for those who need them.Now if somebody would just release another outstanding Movie of the Week:  &#34;A Cold Night's Death&#34;.",4,"Sort of an early Michael Crichton version of ""24""",1404172800,"07 1, 2014",2014,1801,"['Most', 'ABC', 'Movies', 'Week', 'back', '1970s', 'were', 'pretty', 'forgettable', 'stuff', 'few', 'were', 'worthy', 'being', 'preserved', 'DVD', 'releases', 'would', 'obviously', 'include', '34', 'Brian', 'Song', '34', '34', 'Night', 'Stalker', '34', 'sequel', '34', 'Night', 'Strangler', '34', '34', 'Pursuit', '34', '.I', 'remember', 'being', 'impressed', 'enough', 'movie', 'went', 'looking', 'book', '34', 'John', 'Lange', '34', 'really', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'book', 'certainly', 'better', 'name', '34', 'Binary', '34', 'fact', 'fast', 'read', 'more', 'detailed', 'intense', 'movie', 'made', 'suspenseful', 'enough', 'though', 'plot', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'driven', 'intelligence', 'agent', 'quarry', 'extremist', 'millionaire', 'hatching', 'deadly', 'plot', 'film', 'see', 'running', 'countdown', 'clock', 'quite', 'while', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'counting', 'down', 'out', 'millionaire', 'fanatic', 'much', 'much', 'bigger', 'plans', 'just', 'simple', 'bomb', 'assassination', 'up', 'intelligence', 'agent', 'Steven', 'Graves', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'madman', 'up', 'even', 'when', 'Graves', 'figured', 'out', 'may', 'be', 'way', 'stop', 'it.I', 'found', 'acting', 'adequate', 'several', 'familiar', '1970s', 'TV', 'including', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'William', 'Windom', 'E.', 'G.', 'Marshall', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'puzzle', 'mystery', 'nature', 'sort', 'limits', 'acting', 'range', 'things', 'Marshall', 'smug', 'vanity', 'Gazzara', 'intensity', 'frustration.The', 'movie', 'transfer', 'poor', 'muddy', 'Better', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'had', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'surprise', 'are', 'captions', 'however', 'who', 'need', 'them.Now', 'somebody', 'would', 'just', 'release', 'outstanding', 'Movie', 'Week', '34', 'A', 'Cold', 'Night', 'Death', '34']",Pursuit
