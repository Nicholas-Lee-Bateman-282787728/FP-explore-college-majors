482427,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,6305897786,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[2, 16]","You'd think a film about finding the gateway to Hell might be interesting, but no. The Ninth Gate is a disastrous film and is a film I'm sure Johnny Depp would rather forget. This is probably one of the dumbest (And most boring) religious thrillers ever made. It's inconsistent, jumbled, confused, and not quite sure what it wants to be. Here's my opinion for why I think you should keep this gate closed.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a man who is hired by avid book collectors to track down rare books and investigate their authenticity. He is then hired by a man named Boris Balkan who wants him to investigate the authenticity of a book he recently acquired that supposedly can conjure the devil and open the gateway to Hell. So he gives Dean Corso the book and sends him to Portugal and France to compare it with two other copies that are about the same topic, but have different things about them such as differences in pictures. But then people start dropping dead around Corso, and someone is out to kill him and get the book. Along his journey to finding out the mystery to the Ninth Gate, he meets a mysterious woman who seems to have powers (I couldn't help but shake my head when there were scenes in which she glides down to Corso). Together they are taken on a dangerous journey full of mystery, deceit, and devil worship. The story doesn't go anywhere interesting and you're left bored senseless at the ridiculous plot.MUSIC: This is one of the only areas of the film that actually worked. The musical score was decent and it seemed to fit the mood for the most part, but it was kind of dreary and dull at times.ACTION: This film is very dull. This film can't seem to decide what it wants to be. Sometimes it tries to be a thriller. Sometimes a horror film. Sometimes a mystery. Sometimes it tries to be action. Sometimes it tries to be suspense. The problem here is the fact that none of these areas work. This in turn, turns the film into a garbled and inconsistent mess. It doesn't work as a thriller because well, there is nothing thrilling about it. It's not horror because it just isn't scary at all. It's not mystery because it's a cliched mess in which it doesn't take all that much time to figure out whose behind it. It's not action because it's badly done and full of terrible fight scenes. Then it doesn't work as suspense because you're never afraid (Not to mention excited) about what comes next because you already know what's going to happen. Let's also not forget this film features some of the most pointless sex/nude scenes I've ever seen. They are not done tastefully and they are laughable. Sadly, you can't pull a ""so bad it's good"" value out of this film, so don't even try.ACTING: Johnny Depp is a good actor in most of his films, but he clearly dropped the ball in this film. He looked and sounded bored through the entire film as if wondering to himself, ""Why the hell am I even here? I was in Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands, dammit! Is this what I've reduced myself to?"" The other actors don't fare any better and are actually worse. Many of the actors seem comatose in their roles and display no emotion or believability. Then when the villains get into worshiping Satan you can't help but mock them because it's completely ridiculous and certainly in no way terrifying. When the actors do try and display emotion, they come off as a complete joke. Casting mishaps are aplenty in this film. But then again, I don't know whether I should blame the actors or the script, or maybe both. Still, this area is a complete mess.OVERALL: While it may have a few interesting scenes and decent music, that will never excuse how bad of a mess this film is. It tries to be too many things at one, and it doesn't succeed at any of the genres it tries to be. It's a dreadfully dull film with no mystery or intrigue because you can always guess what happens next thanks to the terrible, cliched script. It has no good acting and you won't care about what happens to any of these people. A dull and thoroughly un-thrilling religious thriller that's also emotionally removed. Skip it.THE GOOD: A few interesting scenes and decent music.THE BAD: Terrible script, bad acting, it's dull and slow-moving, no scares, no mystery, no thrills, no cool action moments, and it's definitely not suspenseful.",2,EYE-ROLLING STUPIDITY  4 OUT OF 10,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,4342,"[""'d"", 'think', 'film', 'finding', 'gateway', 'Hell', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'disastrous', 'film', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'would', 'rather', 'forget', 'probably', 'one', 'dumbest', 'most', 'boring', 'religious', 'thrillers', 'ever', 'made', 'inconsistent', 'jumbled', 'confused', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'be', 'Here', 'opinion', 'why', 'think', 'should', 'keep', 'gate', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Dean', 'Corso', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'man', 'who', 'hired', 'avid', 'book', 'collectors', 'track', 'down', 'rare', 'books', 'investigate', 'authenticity', 'then', 'hired', 'man', 'named', 'Boris', 'Balkan', 'who', 'investigate', 'authenticity', 'book', 'recently', 'acquired', 'supposedly', 'can', 'conjure', 'devil', 'open', 'gateway', 'Hell', 'So', 'Dean', 'Corso', 'book', 'Portugal', 'France', 'compare', 'two', 'other', 'copies', 'are', 'same', 'topic', 'have', 'different', 'things', 'such', 'differences', 'pictures', 'then', 'people', 'start', 'dropping', 'dead', 'Corso', 'someone', 'out', 'kill', 'get', 'book', 'journey', 'finding', 'out', 'mystery', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'who', 'have', 'powers', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'shake', 'head', 'when', 'were', 'scenes', 'down', 'Corso', 'Together', 'are', 'taken', 'dangerous', 'journey', 'full', 'mystery', 'deceit', 'devil', 'worship', 'story', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'interesting', ""'re"", 'left', 'bored', 'senseless', 'ridiculous', 'plot.MUSIC', 'one', 'only', 'areas', 'film', 'actually', 'worked', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'decent', 'seemed', 'fit', 'mood', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'kind', 'dreary', 'dull', 'times.ACTION', 'film', 'very', 'dull', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'decide', 'what', 'be', 'Sometimes', 'be', 'thriller', 'horror', 'film', 'mystery', 'be', 'action', 'be', 'suspense', 'problem', 'here', 'fact', 'none', 'areas', 'work', 'turn', 'film', 'garbled', 'inconsistent', 'mess', ""n't"", 'work', 'thriller', 'well', 'nothing', 'thrilling', 'not', 'horror', 'just', ""n't"", 'scary', 'not', 'mystery', 'cliched', 'mess', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'time', 'figure', 'out', 'not', 'action', 'badly', 'done', 'full', 'terrible', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Then', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'suspense', ""'re"", 'never', 'afraid', 'Not', 'mention', 'excited', 'what', 'next', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Let', 'also', 'not', 'forget', 'film', 'most', 'pointless', 'sex/nude', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'tastefully', 'are', 'laughable', 'Sadly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pull', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'value', 'film', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try.ACTING', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'good', 'actor', 'most', 'films', 'clearly', 'dropped', 'ball', 'film', 'looked', 'sounded', 'bored', 'entire', 'film', 'wondering', 'Why', 'hell', 'am', 'even', 'here', 'was', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'dammit', 'what', ""'ve"", 'reduced', 'other', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'fare', 'better', 'are', 'actually', 'worse', 'Many', 'actors', 'seem', 'comatose', 'roles', 'display', 'emotion', 'believability', 'Then', 'when', 'villains', 'get', 'worshiping', 'Satan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'mock', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'certainly', 'way', 'terrifying', 'When', 'actors', 'do', 'try', 'display', 'emotion', 'come', 'off', 'complete', 'joke', 'Casting', 'mishaps', 'are', 'aplenty', 'film', 'then', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'should', 'blame', 'actors', 'script', 'maybe', 'Still', 'area', 'complete', 'mess.OVERALL', 'may', 'have', 'few', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'decent', 'music', 'will', 'never', 'excuse', 'how', 'bad', 'mess', 'film', 'be', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'one', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'genres', 'be', 'dreadfully', 'dull', 'film', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'can', 'always', 'guess', 'what', 'next', 'thanks', 'terrible', 'cliched', 'script', 'good', 'acting', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'people', 'dull', 'thoroughly', 'un-thrilling', 'religious', 'thriller', 'also', 'emotionally', 'removed', 'Skip', 'it.THE', 'GOOD', 'few', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'decent', 'music.THE', 'BAD', 'Terrible', 'script', 'bad', 'acting', 'dull', 'slow-moving', 'scares', 'mystery', 'thrills', 'cool', 'action', 'moments', 'definitely', 'not', 'suspenseful']",The Ninth Gate

Commentator,"[2, 3]","In its opening scene the film references ""Don Quixote,"" setting the stage for a story of an anti-hero's quest, a tale laced with light mockery of contemporary society.

This movie is for anyone who has ever felt the passion of collecting or experienced how thrilling research can be, and wants a change from the usual Hollywood heroics.The audio and video quality on the DVD is good, and the disc has a lot of bonuses, my favorites being Polanski's full-length, in-depth commentary on the film and the 'gallery' which allows you to scroll through the 'LCF' and 'AT' engravings... which are reproduced in fairly low-resolution, unfortunately.In the end I suspect 'The Ninth Gate' will recieve much the same treatment as 'Vertigo'- be misunderstood by its contemporaries and be rediscovered several decades later when its outstanding production features, superbly constructed plot and acting are finally recognized. I hope history remembers this film as being one of the best of the late 20th century, as well as one of the most revealing of our culture's psychology.I think the sheer number of people who feel compelled to comment on it testifies to its ability to effect people... even if they do hate it.",5,"A Beautiful, Intelligent Film",993081600,"06 21, 2001",2001,1709,"['opening', 'scene', 'film', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'setting', 'stage', 'story', 'anti-hero', 'quest', 'tale', 'laced', 'light', 'mockery', 'contemporary', 'society', 'world', 'embraced', ""'information"", 'age', 'relativistic', 'morality', 'information', 'good', 'what', ""'good"", 'anyway', 'anyone', 'reading', 'discuss', 'film', 'enigmatic', 'plot', 'compare', 'notes', '*real*', ""'variations"", 'engravings', 'seen', 'film', 'please', 'e-mail', 'me.All', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'not', 'average', 'viewer', 'who', 'something', 'blow', 'up', 'second', 'let', 'brain', 'go', 'sleep', 'walk', 'away', 'film', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'feeling', 'inside', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'felt', 'passion', 'collecting', 'experienced', 'how', 'thrilling', 'research', 'can', 'be', 'change', 'usual', 'Hollywood', 'heroics.The', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'DVD', 'good', 'disc', 'lot', 'bonuses', 'favorites', 'being', 'Polanski', 'full-length', 'in-depth', 'commentary', 'film', ""'gallery"", 'scroll', ""'LCF"", ""'AT"", 'engravings', 'are', 'reproduced', 'fairly', 'low-resolution', 'end', 'suspect', ""'The"", 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'will', 'recieve', 'much', 'same', 'treatment', ""'Vertigo'-"", 'be', 'misunderstood', 'contemporaries', 'be', 'rediscovered', 'several', 'decades', 'later', 'when', 'outstanding', 'production', 'features', 'superbly', 'constructed', 'plot', 'acting', 'are', 'finally', 'recognized', 'hope', 'history', 'remembers', 'film', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'most', 'revealing', 'culture', 'psychology.I', 'think', 'sheer', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'compelled', 'comment', 'ability', 'effect', 'people', 'even', 'do', 'hate']",The Ninth Gate

Lot of reasons makes the film worthwhile, one of the reasons being, a brilliant performance from the protagonist 'Dean Curso' played with perfection by Johnny Depp. Depp not only easily steps into Curso's shoes but also breathes a lot of life into the character, you can almost read his mind every time and every moment. A similarly stunning performance from Emmanuelle Seigner and Frank Langella who support Depp completely in making this film worth watching more than just once. Watch out for Lena Olin in a brief but an impressive appearance. The film begins in a slow pace but will make you grow more and more curious every moment as the story suddenly takes on a rapid pace and surprises start to come in.

482445,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,6305897786,atmj,"[0, 1]","This movie had so much potential.  Unfortunately, it never lived up to it.  It was almost emotionless.Johnny Depp plays a suave antique book dealer that excels in screwing people moneywise.  He always gets his book.  His  reputation leads an equally unscrupulous book collector Frank Langella to  seek out his services.  The service he wants him to perform, is to examine  the companion copies of his own rare book to determine the fakes.  Once  this can be determined this book collector wants to own the original at all  costs.  His stress on this extreme is clear, that he would expect Johnny  Depp to kill to obtain this book for him.  He won't take no for an answer,  from Johnny Depp either.The attraction to this book, is that it is  proported to be co-authored by the devil himself and the possessor, would  if properly used gain supernatural (or in this case subnatural?)  powers.The premise was wonderfully set up.  On top of that, the book  that Johnny Depp is entrusted with was apparently obtained in such a  fashion that the owner would kill to get it back.  Unfortunately, Johnny  Depp's character finds this out only at the death of his partner.  His  partner's death amazing resembles a tile in the book.The promise of  this story, is never met, even though, it has many twisted insights: the  mysterious girl on the train, the tiles matching the various deaths that  follow, etc.  But, they are presented in a matter of fact way that there  is no build up of suspense or tension in any fashion.  At one point in  time when Lena Olin's character steals the book from Johnny Depp, Frank  Langella kills her to get it back.  There seems to be no sense or horror  to the killings.  Nor any retribution considered.  One small thing is the  European scenery is beautiful.The main finding Johnny Depp's character  adds is that the books, are all partial fakes.  Each one has non-Lucifer  signed tiles and only by taking the real tiles from each of the books, is a  full set possible.  Of course this happens.  But, not completely.  Frank  Langella's character thinks he has and by taking them to a site (a really  neat abandoned castle in Europe, that's significance is never revealed)  ends up self immolating in a show of omnipotence.Johnny Depp escapes  and his &quot;floating&quot; mystery girl tells him what went wrong and  nudges him to find the key to gain this power himself.  You end on the note  of Johnny Depp reentering the castle where Frank Langella toasted  himself.This movie had so much potential that was wasted, the insight  that all 3 books needed to make up the sum of the single set of real tiles,  the mysterious deaths of the previous owners, etc.  However, there was no  sense of depth from the characters.Johnny Depp's character was so  matter of fact about the deaths happening around him, you would think he  was a hard bitten Army captain rather than an antique book dealer.  His  entire sense of strain was portrayed in alcohol bottles and cigarettes.  Frank Langella's role, as usual was over the top power hungry maniac  wearing a bad set of glasses.Lena Olin's character was a little more  involved, but not much more so, with her playing a not so grieving gold  digging widow, who's dead husband's last living act was to part with a book  that she cherished.The floating mystery girl, according to other  reviewers was Roman Polanski's wife.

E Jackson,"[3, 7]","I admit I'm not knowledgable in religion or devil-worshipping or anything of that nature so I didn't really understand any of the plot that took place throughout the movie.  It all went completely over my head.  Every single bit of it.  I went in assuming the Ninth Gate would be like the Exorcist- you know, taking horror elements and combining them with suspense- but more modernized, and of course, taken from a different angle so any comparisons to the Exorcist be kept to a minimum.Instead it's a slow-moving storyline that revolves around Johnny Depp's character exploring dark dingy areas and libraries, reading book after book... and *more* books.  The only suspense a viewer can possibly comprehend are those experienced in religion and know a thing or two concerning the religious-themed lines being spoken.  These unsuspenseful book reading segments last for over an hour and 20 minutes.  It's mental torture for those who've been confused since the beginning of the film.  By the ending I was completely lost and unassure what really occurred.  I see fire in the background so I assume they're in hell.The suspense never really delivers because the actual plot that builds to these segments never made any sense to me.  This movie was destined to be a letdown for me due to an inability to understand what's even going on (and understand religion for that matter- *all* religions) and I wish I'd known this little fact before going into it.  I think the old man lying dead in the fountain was the lucky one since he realized that only a devil would come up with such a confusing and boring movie, so he knew suicide (or being killed) was the only way to escape.  The other moment of suspense was really oddly executed too- an old lady in a wheelchair going into another room that soon results in an apartment fire.  Strange.  Oh and the old man hanging himself in the beginning?  A devious attempt at luring in viewers, making them assume the rest of the film will be loaded with similar segments.Another problem is that basically everything Johnny Depp stars in doesn't appeal to me in the least.  The Pirates of the Carribean series is the biggest offender.  Sword swinging and... more swinging.  Puts me to sleep.  Everything he stars in feels overblown to the point of being unwatchable, in both the presentation and storyline.I'm not used to movies like the Ninth Gate at all, and if someone would kindly make a list of other similar types of films, I'll be sure to write them down and memorize them so I can avoid them like the plague.  Rosemary's Baby is one.  I assume Jacob's Ladder and the Silence of the Lambs are others.  Anymore?  Oh wait, it's mandatory to avoid the Davinci Code too.

482454,A2SZ86FLBMZPLL,6305897786,"B. Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[4, 5]","Opinions when it comes to movies tend to convey a bit more stridency than those involving music or even television, as if a level of aesthete is involved that is so profound that it evokes a part of one's being... of course, that may just apply to the more catty drama dorks out there.Anyhow, there are many examples too numerous for practical purposes of documenting.  To focus on just one good example would be THE NINTH GATE.  Many people disliked this film, and some did so with a hint of indignation.  It might have been because of raised expectations, either for their adulations of Roman Polanski as a director, or because it was a film featuring the ""divinely magnificent"" Johnny Depp (who actually is an exceptionally good actor with a decent knack for picking projects; comments in quotations were not meant as an affront to Mr. Depp, but to those who overly idolize him), or because this film deals with elements of the supernatural including the Devil.  If in fact you are expecting a terrifying episode of demonic encounters replete with gore and sensationalism, then you might not like this film, which has a more stately pacing and emphasizes ambiance and atmosphere over glitzy special effects.  Others were disappointed because the film only partially reflects the book it was based on (""Club Dumas"", which I actually also read - pretty impressive, huh?), although to be fair, the book's structure would not have really been ideal for close adaptation.I admit that I was really intrigued by the premise, especially when the element of interaction by Lucifer was suggested, because done well it can be fascinating, although it is also runs the big risk of embarrassing failure, given the heightened expectations.  The trailers were effective enough, and Johnny Depp picks good movies more often than not, so I thought it was worth a look.  The movie was not quite what I expected, but still kept my interest, in spite of the aforementioned moderate pacing and a subject matter (rare book appraisals) which I would not have ordinarily found especially fascinating.  It was an intellectual rather than visceral effort, and the acting was actually somewhat effective as it turns out.  Though some have incorrectly characterized the acting as being lackadaisical and/or stilted or uninspiring (among the many adjectives used), the director and actors wisely chose a more understated approach, which is more realistic and less (melo)dramatic.  As a result, Depp was convincing in his role as a mercenary book appraiser not always above unscrupulous methods, and Frank Langella was quite effective in his role as an accomplished but ruthless publisher and collector, whose sophistication almost masks his sinister agenda.  Their nuanced performances were far more appropriate and believable, rather than over-the-top affectations which would have just come off as campy and out of place (Sean Penn and Al Pacino and Tom Cruise need not have auditioned).The story centers on a book titled ""The Ninth Gate of the Kingdom of Shadows"", an obscure but legendary tome rumored to have Lucifer as a contributor.  Depp's character is Dean Corso, a highly sought though morally relaxed appraiser.  He is hired by Boris Balkan (Langella) to find other remaining copies - if they still exist - to determine the book's authenticity.  What seemed initially like a thorough and arduous investigation came to include hazardous intrigue, the interventions of mysterious strangers, untimely deaths, and more danger than Corso was prepared for.  Along the way, the financial appeal of the lucrative assignment gives way to the need for answers to the danger and intrigue, which in turn gives way to a pursuit of something possibly unworldly and beyond belief.  Though some will stubbornly disagree, I think what helps make this film work is the element of ambiguity regarding the book's authenticity and nature, as well as those of at least one other character in the film, and the film's ending itself.As I am not an easy laugh, I tend to be a challenging audience for comedies.  Similarly, I am not an easy scare and do not impress easily when it comes to horror films.  Though I am not sure that this would be accurately categorized as a horror film (it could be more accurately described as a supernatural thriller), I will risk the razzing and aspersions and insults to say that one of the more scary/frightening/evocative (as measured by the goosebump meter) sequences I have ever come across in movies is in this film.  Polanski is regarded by some as a genius, though not all his films are well received.  If you can dispense with any preconceived expectations and approach this with an open mind, there is a decent chance you might find this film's merits as both a creative project and a skillfully crafted effort.",4,"Not what I was expecting, but still good (in a different way)",1183075200,"06 29, 2007",2007,4815,"['Opinions', 'when', 'movies', 'tend', 'convey', 'bit', 'more', 'stridency',

""The Ninth Gate"" is the Polar Opposite to ""Sleepy Hollow"". Both are Exceptional Horror films, both star Johnny Depp, but they are very different Horror films.There is Barely a Scene in the film that Johnny doesn't act in, the film is Entirely His. He plays David Korso, a Unscrupulous finder of Rare Books. He is commissioned by a Strange Collector (Frank Langella) to find out if his book, titled ""The Ninth Gate"", is genuine or fake. His search leads him to a lot of Strange Characters and a few Close Calls.The Whole film has an ""Angel Heart"" feel about it, and it makes a Good Companion piece to that film. The film has a Slow pace, but it Never Lags, it's not Action Packed or Full of Effects, but they Are Both There when Necessary. It's Definitely not for Everyone, you need Patience, a Good night's sleep the Night Before and a Stomach for Satanic stuff.Johnny's Understated Performance looks Utterly Effortless, He Carries this Heavy with Ease. Frank Langella is Appropriately Mysterious and Sinister in his Few scenes, every other performer in the film are limited to few scenes, but they All make the most of their time. Emmanuelle Seigner is Also Mysterious, which is probably due to the fact that she's no a very good Actress. She is Still very Sexy though. Lena Olin breaths life into the film as a Crazed Satanist, she too is quite Good Looking in the film, and she also Acts well. Ultimately, the Thesping is left up to Johnny and his performance will Make or Break the film for you. For me, it Definitely Made it.

He hires nefarious book seller Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) to travel to Europe and examine the other two copies to see if they are originals, or forgeries.

This movie had a decent cast, a pretty good premise, and some tried and true creative personalities behind it. I was  wondering how Roman Polanski had directed the scenes in New York (as he is  permanently ruled off from revisiting these shores due to his indiscretion  with  a minor a couple decades back). Now I learn through a review that the  New York scenes were filmed in Europe (well that explains that!).It  is sad to see how Polanski has slipped, if this film is any indication of  his present-day creative ability. He historically has had an eye for a  script and the energy needed to pull off an idiosincratically appealing  interpretation of whatever text he has chosen to take on. This can be  verified by recalling the major films he has directed: &quot;Knife in the  Water,&quot; &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers,&quot;  &quot;Macbeth&quot;(his paean to his recently deceased wife, Sharon Tate)  &quot;Repulsion,&quot; &quot;Chinatown,&quot; &quot;Rosemary's Baby.&quot;  Not a bad list by any stretch of the imagination. That he should be reduced  to producing and directing such an unimaginative, trite, hackneyed (want  any more synoyms?)  piece of tripe as this is dissapointing and sad to one  of his fans (of whom I still count myself).The plotline has been done  beyond death in recent cinema. There is absolutely nothing original or  fresh on display here. I kept searching for a quirk in character or plot  that would justify my expectations, but sadly none was forthcoming. The  only thing that truly amazed me was how much Frank Langella now resembles a  slightly younger Gore Vidal. He seems to have somehow morphed quite  successfully actually (due to some Satanic pact? Maybe Gore actually sold  his soul to replace the younger Langella?). Emmanuel Sanger (Polanski's  current wife) is an example of cinematic nepotism run rampant. She has got  to be the most wooden, untalented actresses since Marion Davies, and was  cast by Polanski for the same reasons as Hearst insisted on. Her most  intense scenes involve the camera focusing in on her cosmetically altered  eyes engaged in some sort of demonic stare, which ends up looking  incredibly risible, more appropriate to Comedy Central than spine-tingling  horror. The stare serves as a fairly appropriate meatphor for the film as a  whole. There is not a moment of apprehension, much less true horror, about  it. Nothing spooky, nothing chilling, nothing weird... just banal images of  repetetive and unbelievable figments of a poor screenwriter's paltry  imagination.I hope that this film doesn't signal the true eclipse of a  creative and dynamic filmmaker. Other important directors had their share  of clunkers.

He  finds people rare books, appraises collections and is a collector (for  profitable resale only) as well.  However, he has the reputation for being  the &quot;used car salesman&quot; among literary circles.However, his  slimy ways impress Boris Balkan (played with chilling delight by Frank  Langella), a billionaire publisher who has just purchased a book called  &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; from a Gentleman named Tefler.  Problem is the  book belonged to his wife and she wants it back, but I'll explain a little  later.Balkan knows that there are 3 copies of the &quot;The Ninth  Gate&quot; still available and Corso is to track the other two and get them  (at any cost).  Why is this book so valuable?  Because, supposidly it was  co-authored by the Devil himself and shows the way to bring him back to the  &quot;real world&quot; through this gate.So the adventures take him to  Spain, Portugal and France where he meets the other two owners and is  tracked by this mysterious woman, who acts as his guardian angel.  However,  Ms. Tefler with her henchman is also trying to snatch the book at every  opportunity.This was a very good premise in the hands of a very good  director (Roman Polanski of Chinatown fame), so what happened?1. The  story becomes boring and generic at the half way point.  Nothing  spectacular or sinister ever really happens.2. The contents of the book  are never explored.  Of all those pages of text, the pictures are the only  things of any value?3. Johnny Depp was fairly wooden as the lead, and  Emmaunelle Seigner (who plays the Guardian) is too stoic for her role  description.4. The ending is a sham.  It betrays the whole first half  and makes little sense.5. Frank Langella, who is by far the most  sinsister character in the movie disappears and only is heard once every 20  minutes or so on the telephone.This and the other Devil apolcaypse  movies have failed in it's story telling and delivery as well (End of Days  and Stigmata).

Just like the movie, where three copies of one book must be found for the message of the books to make any sense, one must know the story of Polanski and his dance with the devil for this movie to make the mind boggling amount of sense it ultimately does make.I loved the romance with books that the character of Johnny Depp has, being one who tracks down valuable editions and traveling in the circles of readers who value such things. The scenes of wall to wall rare books made my heart race the way some people are excited by football, or pornography, or chocolate. For me, it's books.Depp must track down three copies of one volume to determine their authenticity, for each one is a little different -- only to discover, with his brilliant mind, that all three books work together to manifest the message of the books: the ability to conjure up the devil!You can imagine the imagery that can be lent to such a thesis, and it exists as only Polanski can do it -- Polanski, of course, being the producer of Rosemary's baby and the former husband of the former actress Sharon Tate, and everything that goes along with that. Polanski is not naive when it comes to the oddities of Lucifer, of that I am quite sure. What his relationship is, exactly, is not for me to discern. I will say, though, that there were parts of this movie that reminded me, with discomfort, of Eyes Wide Shut.This movie is not for everyone. It is definitely not for children.

482483,A1MJ682JQH816G,6305897786,Chad A. B. Wilson,"[3, 6]","Roman Polanski is an uneven filmmaker. Somtimes he produces a great, original story that captures the imagination, as inThe Pianist: The Extraordinary True Story of One Man's Survival in Warsaw, 1939-1945(2002) andChinatown (Special Collector's Edition)(1974). Other times, he manages to create creepy psychological drama, as inRosemary's Baby(1968) andThe Tenant(1976). In fact, Chinatown continues to be one of my favorite newer film noirs, and Rosemary's Baby is the ultimate example of how to combine horror and humor in what is ultimately a scary movie.But sometimes Polanski's films are just okay, as inFrantic(1988) and downright bad, as inPirates [Import] (1986). The Ninth Gate (1999) is one of those okay movies.It's based on the book by Arturo Perez-Reverte calledThe Club Dumas, which was recommended to me by my friend J. Mark Bertrand. I loved it. The book was about a conniving book dealer who is researching two books at once--a lost version of a chapter by Dumas and another book called The Ninth Gate. What made Perez-Reverte's version great is the way that the main character, Corso, gets mixed up in both of them. By the end, it's almost as if he can't distinguish fantasy and reality, and so he ends up falling into several strange situations dealing with satanism and Dumas lovers. And they look a lot alike, too.But Polanski removes all of the Dumas stuff and makes the movie solely about Corso and The Ninth Gate, a book supposedly ghostwritten by Lucifer. What he creates here is a creepy movie with a great character. Johnny Depp plays Corso as laid-back yet unscrupulous, and his acting fits the character superbly. For the first hour, the tension is taut and building. And then you learn what is actually happening, or at least what may be happening. And it goes downhill from there.Sure the ending is left open, but it's not necessarily a good thing. Sure there is psychological drama. But by the end, I don't care anymore. The plot has become so ridiculous that I don't care about the characters or whether they manage to actually conjure the devil. And the movie incidentally features one of the stupidest sex scenes on film.So all in all, it's an okay movie.",3,The Gate to Mediocre Filmmaking,1205193600,"03 11, 2008",2008,2190,"['Roman', 'Polanski', 'uneven', 'filmmaker', 'great', 'original', 'story', 'imagination', 'inThe', 'Pianist', 'Extraordinary', 'True', 'Story', 'One', 'Man', 'Survival', 'Warsaw', '1939-1945', '2002', 'andChinatown', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', '1974', 'Other', 'times', 'create', 'creepy', 'psychological', 'drama', 'inRosemary', 'Baby', '1968', 'andThe', 'Tenant', '1976', 'fact', 'Chinatown', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'newer', 'film', 'noirs', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'ultimate', 'example', 'how', 'combine', 'horror', 'humor', 'what', 'ultimately', 'scary', 'movie.But', 'sometimes', 'Polanski', 'films', 'are', 'just', 'okay', 'inFrantic', '1988', 'downright', 'bad', 'inPirates', '[', 'Import', ']', '1986', 'Ninth', 'Gate', '1999', 'one', 'okay', 'movies.It', 'based', 'book', 'Arturo', 'Perez-Reverte', 'calledThe', 'Club', 'Dumas', 'was', 'recommended', 'friend', 'J', 'Mark', 'Bertrand', 'loved', 'book', 'was', 'conniving', 'book', 'dealer', 'who', 'researching', 'two', 'books', 'once', 'lost', 'version', 'chapter', 'Dumas', 'book', 'called', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'What', 'made', 'Perez-Reverte', 'version', 'great', 'way', 'main', 'character', 'Corso', 'mixed', 'up', 'end', 'almost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'distinguish', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'so', 'up', 'falling', 'several', 'strange', 'situations', 'dealing', 'satanism', 'Dumas', 'lovers', 'look', 'lot', 'alike', 'too.But', 'Polanski', 'Dumas', 'stuff', 'movie', 'solely', 'Corso', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'book', 'supposedly', 'ghostwritten', 'Lucifer', 'What', 'here', 'creepy', 'movie', 'great', 'character', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Corso', 'laid-back', 'yet', 'unscrupulous', 'acting', 'character', 'superbly', 'first', 'hour', 'tension', 'taut', 'building', 'then', 'learn', 'what', 'actually', 'happening', 'least', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'happening', 'downhill', 'there.Sure', 'ending', 'left', 'open', 'not', 'necessarily', 'good', 'thing', 'Sure', 'psychological', 'drama', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore', 'plot', 'become', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'manage', 'actually', 'conjure', 'devil', 'movie', 'incidentally', 'one', 'stupidest', 'sex', 'scenes', 'film.So', 'okay', 'movie']",The Ninth Gate

482500,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,6305897786,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[1, 3]","Controversial director Roman Polanski (Rosemary's BabyandChinatown) has a talent for creating suspenseful films that utilize character actors in roles, which allow them to be ambiguous and amorphous. In his thriller, The Ninth gate, he returns to the genres he seems to be the most comfortable with: psychological suspense, and horror. Loosely based upon the bookEl Club Dumas, which was written by acclaimed Spanish author Arturo P&eacute;rez-Reverte, The Ninth Gate is a straightforward mystery/conspiracy with supernatural elements. The screenplay written by Enrique Urbizu, Roman Polanski, and John Brownjohn, greatly simplifies the novel, which was deemed too complex and plot heavy to film in its entirety. However, in spite of this harsh adaptive process the film is quite impressive, though it may be a disappointment for fans of the novel.Dean Corso is an unscrupulous bibliophile and book appraiser, who specializes in rare and highly valuable books. When he is contacted by billionaire Boris Balkan to verify the authenticity of the satanic volume, The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, by seeking out the only other two existing copies. Balkan claims that he purchased his copy from a man named Telfer who committed suicide the day after he sold the book.Corso goes on a mercenary quest that takes him through Europe and he crosses paths with some very strange and unsavory characters. He has a shallow sexual encounter with Telfer's wife, Liana, who desperately wants the book back. Corso also has repeat encounters with an enigmatic and beautiful stranger, who seems to show up whenever he needs help of some sort. Corso soon learns that she is not what she seems.It becomes apparent that Corso is being closely monitored by Boris Balkan, who calls him repeatedly to demand updates on his success, and it's also apparent that Liana Telfer has sent her lethal bodyguard after Corso and the book.While examining and comparing the different copies of the book, Corso stumbles onto a secret. There are subtle differences in the book's illustrations, which serve as symbols or keys to conjuring the Devil, and Corso realizes that all three copies are legitimate but only with all of the illustrations can one understand their true meaning.As people around him start dying, Corso finds himself caught in the middle of a deadly diabolical conspiracy. He soon learns that some books are dangerous, that some mysteries should never be solved, and that some doors are better left unopened.Stylistically, The Ninth Gate has much in common with 1940s film noir, as well as the more sophisticated horror films of the `60s and `70s. The film is very reminiscent of Roman Polanski's other films and yet it never feels redundant or predictable, which in itself is unusual when you consider the genre that he's working within. The film is boosted by a terrific score by Wojciech Kilar, and the combined efforts of the production designer, the costume designer, and the cinematographer. But the film's greatest asset is Polanski's uncanny ability to tell a sensational story while allowing the audience to suspend disbelief.The Ninth Gate features a superb cast, which includes Johnny Depp as Dean Corso, Frank Langella as Boris Balkan, Lena Olin as Liana Telfer, And Emmanuelle Seigner as The Girl.The DVD includes an audio commentary by Roman Polanski, an isolated music score, a featurette, a gallery of satanic drawings, storyboard selections, production notes, cast & crew bios, theatrical trailers and TV spots.Also recommended:The SkullThe Exorcist - The Complete AnthologyThe Complete Omen CollectionThe Seventh SignThe Devil's AdvocateStigmataFrom Hell",4,An Incendiary Thriller,1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,3661,"['Controversial', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Rosemary', 'BabyandChinatown', 'talent', 'creating', 'suspenseful', 'films', 'utilize', 'character', 'actors', 'roles', 'allow', 'be', 'ambiguous', 'amorphous', 'thriller', 'Ninth', 'gate', 'genres', 'be', 'most', 'comfortable', 'psychological', 'suspense', 'horror', 'Loosely', 'based', 'bookEl', 'Club', 'Dumas', 'was', 'written', 'acclaimed', 'Spanish', 'author', 'Arturo', 'P', 'eacute', 'rez-Reverte', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'straightforward', 'mystery/conspiracy', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Enrique', 'Urbizu', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'John', 'Brownjohn', 'greatly', 'novel', 'was', 'deemed', 'too', 'complex', 'plot', 'heavy', 'film', 'entirety', 'However', 'spite', 'harsh', 'adaptive', 'process', 'film', 'quite', 'impressive', 'may', 'be', 'disappointment', 'fans', 'novel.Dean', 'Corso', 'unscrupulous', 'bibliophile', 'book', 'appraiser', 'who', 'rare', 'highly', 'valuable', 'books', 'When', 'contacted', 'billionaire', 'Boris', 'Balkan', 'verify', 'authenticity', 'satanic', 'volume', 'Nine', 'Gates', 'Kingdom', 'Shadows', 'seeking', 'out', 'only', 'other', 'two', 'existing', 'copies', 'Balkan', 'purchased', 'copy', 'man', 'named', 'Telfer', 'who', 'committed', 'day', 'sold', 'book.Corso', 'mercenary', 'quest', 'Europe', 'paths', 'very', 'strange', 'unsavory', 'characters', 'shallow', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'Telfer', 'wife', 'Liana', 'who', 'desperately', 'book', 'back', 'Corso', 'also', 'repeat', 'encounters', 'enigmatic', 'beautiful', 'stranger', 'who', 'show', 'up', 'whenever', 'help', 'sort', 'Corso', 'soon', 'not', 'what', 'seems.It', 'becomes', 'apparent', 'Corso', 'being', 'closely', 'monitored', 'Boris', 'Balkan', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'demand', 'updates', 'success', 'also', 'apparent', 'Liana', 'Telfer', 'sent', 'lethal', 'bodyguard', 'Corso', 'book.While', 'examining', 'comparing', 'different', 'copies', 'book', 'Corso', 'secret', 'are', 'subtle', 'differences', 'book', 'illustrations', 'serve', 'symbols', 'keys', 'conjuring', 'Devil', 'Corso', 'three', 'copies', 'are', 'legitimate', 'only', 'illustrations', 'can', 'one', 'understand', 'true', 'meaning.As', 'people', 'start', 'dying', 'Corso', 'caught', 'middle', 'deadly', 'diabolical', 'conspiracy', 'soon', 'books', 'are', 'dangerous', 'mysteries', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'solved', 'doors', 'are', 'better', 'left', 'unopened.Stylistically', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'much', 'common', '1940s', 'film', 'noir', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'horror', 'films', '60s', '70s', 'film', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'other', 'films', 'yet', 'never', 'redundant', 'predictable', 'unusual', 'when', 'consider', 'genre', 'working', 'film', 'boosted', 'terrific', 'score', 'Wojciech', 'Kilar', 'combined', 'efforts', 'production', 'designer', 'costume', 'designer', 'cinematographer', 'film', 'greatest', 'asset', 'Polanski', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'tell', 'sensational', 'story', 'allowing', 'audience', 'suspend', 'disbelief.The', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'superb', 'cast', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Dean', 'Corso', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Boris', 'Balkan', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'Liana', 'Telfer', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner', 'Girl.The', 'DVD', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'isolated', 'music', 'score', 'featurette', 'gallery', 'satanic', 'drawings', 'storyboard', 'selections', 'production', 'notes', 'cast', 'crew', 'bios', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'TV', 'spots.Also', 'recommended', 'SkullThe', 'Exorcist', 'Complete', 'AnthologyThe', 'Complete', 'Omen', 'CollectionThe', 'Seventh', 'SignThe', 'Devil', 'AdvocateStigmataFrom', 'Hell']",The Ninth Gate

482505,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,6305897786,Cubist,"[4, 6]","Rewatching this movie recently I was struck by how much it improves upon subsequent viewings. The subtle nuances of Johnny Depp's performance reveal themselves only to confirm that he is definitely one of the greatest living actors working today.It's easy to see why mainstream audiences stayed away from this movie. There is an uneasy mix of playful, black humour and serious dread throughout that constantly keeps the viewer off balance -- in a good way. Also, Depp plays a decidedly unlikable character -- right from the start, where he screws a hapless family out of rare, expensive books, establishes that he is an unscrupulous book dealer only in it for the money. However, Depp's own natural charisma maintains interest in his character and even makes him kinda sympathetic in a weird way as he gradually realizes that he is in way over his head.The use of European locations is excellent and effectively establishes an atmospheric vibe that gets me every time. It doesn't hurt that the film is shot by DP extraordinare, Darius Khondji (Seven). Every frame of this movie is beautifully shot.The DVD itself is pretty good.

482509,A1NLLX3IZAQUFI,6305897786,CyberLouis,"[6, 10]","To start, I will confess I was very disappointed with this movie.  I somehow was lead to believe that I was going to see a thriller with a lot  of suspense and a touch of horror.  On the other hand, what I got was a  mystery novel, a very slow moving mystery novel.  It actually took over two  hours to tell a very simple story (which I have reduced to one  paragraph).Three copies exist of the demonic book called &quot;The Ninth  Gate&quot;.  Balkan has acquired one and believes that his may not be  authentic.  He hires Corso (Johnny Depp), some type of book mercenary, to  determine which of the three copies is authentic.  Corso travels to Europe,  views the other two copies, and determines that the three are authentic but  not identical.  All three books have nine similar drawings, but only three  specific drawings of each book are to be used to assemble the nine needed  perform a mysterious incantation.  Corso figures out how to identify the  correct nine drawings.  With this information, Balkan attempts to recite  the incantation, which does not work.  Corso's mysterious follower, who may  be the Devil herself, tells him that Balkan failed because one of the  drawings he had was a forgery.  She then tells Corso where to find the  remaining drawing.  At the end, we see Corso headed to the ruins referenced  in the book, presumably to recite the incantation.  It is assumed the  incantation will give him unlimited power.As simple as this plot is,  this lengthy movie leaves a number of unanswered questions such as: What  exactly is Corso going to do at the end? Who is the woman who mysteriously  followed him throughout the movie?  Why did he not recognize her  immediately (she looked exactly like the drawing in the book)?  Why did she  choose him to have the correct nine drawings?  What exactly is the mystery  of the ninth gate?Perhaps the director assumed most of us had read the  book upon which the movie is based and knew the answers to these questions.  I also believe the director couldn't decide what kind of story he was  telling (mystery, drama, suspense...)  and couldn't develop his characters.  At the end, the protagonist is not any better for what has happened or any  worse; instead, he seems unchanged (and as one-dimensional as he was at the  start).Though his character learned nothing during the move, Johnny Depp  sure did an excellent job as Dean Corso.

To call that acting is to say that Roman Polanski can actually make a good film. Its not possible, frankly, the acting was horrendious. Its been said that you cannot have a terrible Johnny Depp flick, and I whole-heartedly agree. But you can have a very meodiocre one. Even Johnny Depp seemed lost with his lines, as all the actors fumbled through the story, trying desperatly to fulfill their characters actions, and failing dreadful.And don't get me started on the ending. There's nothing too it, we know that Johnny has found the ninth gate, but whats behind it? Where does it go? Only he knows because all the audience is allowed to see is light shining from the doorway, and his figure heading into it. Also, we gather that his guardien angel could or could not be lucifer incarnate. Even the pictures from The book of nine gates isn't very clear on this.Scenes that could have been scary become rather mundane as the film wears on, and actions seem ludacris as women fly, and men punch each other out without seeming to hit each other. Good for movies from the fifty's, but something from nowaday just doesn't cut it.Johnny Depp is interesting to watch however, as the suave indifferent Indiana-Jones type, who is not only sexy but scholery to boot. His complete indifference to what goes on is what makes him unique for everyone else seems to full of melodrama to be of any real help to the script. Such as the Madam Telfar (Lena Olin) who seems to whole-heartedly delight in scratching and clawing every available guy that comes around. Enough was enough when she tried it on Johnny after sleeping with the guy. But second helpings get old.On the whole I thought this could have made a decent thriller, but fell short, however it is good as a rather light-hearted romp of (evil?) proportions.

Misleadingly hyped as the type of action/horror hybrid we are all too familiar with, ""Ninth Gate"" actually revisits the Noir trappings Polanski played with in ""Chinatown,"" and combines it with the tongue-in-cheek Gothic overtones of ""Rosemary's Baby.""Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso, a used book dealer who is pressed into service as an amateur P.I. by multimillionare Balkan (Frank Langella), who hires him to track down and examine alternate versions of a rare Satanic text.

Depp's Corso encounters femme fatales, eccentric cloistered old money and - most charmingly - a series of rather bookish Old World types.

There's a very brief featurette, as well as the ridiculous trailers which explain why ""Ninth Gate"" failed at the box office. More thoughtfully, Artisan included two bonus audio tracks. The first is a director's commentary, the second is a music-only version. There's also a nice gallery containing the Tarot card-like illustrations that figure so heavily in the film. Unfortunately, there are no subtitles nor are there any foreign language subtitles or language tracks.I have no idea how closely ""The Ninth Gate"" resembles the book it is based on.

482517,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,6305897786,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[15, 18]","Let's be clear about ""The Ninth Gate"": the movie is easily one of Roman Polanski's best, and certainly one of the most deliciously creepy, eerie, unsettling and deeply atmospheric films about diabolism and deviltry ever made.With a script drawn from Spanish author Arturo Perez Reverte's quirky ""Le Club Dumas"", ""The Ninth Gate"" is the Faustian tale of an unscrupulous New York dealer in rare books (played with tactful understatement and curiosity by Johnny Depp) commissioned by secretive tycoon and rare book collector Boris Balkan (played to the hilt by Frank Langella, who nearly steals the show)to authenticate his copy of the Nine Gates to the Kingdom of Shadows (De Umbrarum Regni Novem Portis).That innocent-sounding assignment isn't nearly as easy as it sounds. For one thing, there are three copies of the demonic tome, printed by a 17th century Venetian bookbinder (later burned at the stake for his troubles) and reputedly capable of summoning Satan; Balkan wants Corso to examine the two other volumes (one in Spain, the other in Paris) and determine which is the forgery.Another complication lies with Balkan's book: its previous owner hanged himself shortly after selling his volume to Balkan, and his wealthy widow (played by a supple and cat-like Lena Olin) wants it back. And if that weren't enough, as Corso is drawn deeper into the mystery, those around him begin to die horribly and mysteriously.""The Ninth Gate"" is a rich, heady, delicious mystery, and its palpable sense of growing menace is given nice counterpoint by Director of Photography Darius Khondji's (""Se7en"")lush cinematography, which tracks Corso on his quest through a host of forbidding and enchanting locales: from a decaying Spanish manse, to a Parisian occult library, to a Black Mass in a French castle, to a shadowy and seemingly demon-haunted Manhattan (recreated by the exiled Polanski on a backlot), with the action culminating in a ruined French fortress.The look of the film constitutes a character in itself; the Black Mass in Liana Telfer's restored family chateau recalls the orgy sequence in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut (indeed, the films echo each other in their suggestion of malefic, monstrous forces gliding beneath their gilded and luxurious surfaces). This is a film that dwells on its haunted spaces, a film full of moonlit parapets and occult libraries full of leather-bound volumes. Even the woodcut details of the Nine Gates (drawn from Reverte's book) draw the viewer into a world of recondite and forbidden knowledge. Watching the movie is like being granted admittance into a secret society.The creepiness is nicely accentuated by Wojciech Kilar's haunting score, which is by turns engaging and urging Corso on (the ""Bolero"" like theme undergirding Coros's flight to Madrid) and warding him off.It has been said that the best terror is painted on a palette of silence: ""The Ninth Gate"" is a quiet film, a masterwork of atmosphere whose chief terrors are never directly seen. Indeed, Polanski took Reverte's eccentric and erudite ""Club Dumas"" and plumbed and distilled its essence into a creepy, understatedly scary little film, a minutely detailed little cinematic treasure box whose ultimate horror takes some time to truly sink in.All of the performances are well done, even the small ones. Veteran actor Jack Taylor is splendid as the last scion of a dying aristocratic Spanish family, Emmanuelle Seigneur is alternately hideous and gorgeous as the mysterious Girl that hounds Corso's footsteps (watch her face closely in the movie's final minutes), and Barbara Jefford provides an elegant turn as occult maven and scholar Baroness Kessler.There are a few mis-steps, but nothing fatal: the fight between Olin's thug and the Girl by the Seine is clumsily mounted, and the henchman himself, with his platinum blonde hair and effete mannerisms, more closely resembles an extra from a Madonna video than a Satanic assassin, but that's quibbling in a movie this rich and engaging.With that out of the way: Talk about a mismatch between Marketing and Movie! I think most of the problems viewers had with ""The Ninth Gate"" stems from the way the film was advertised; the movie came out around the time of Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""End of Days"", and the marketing campaigns were similar: fire and brimstone quick cuts and heavy metal musical riffs, leading many to the conclusion that both films would offer CGI-demon slaying.""The Ninth Gate"" is not an action movie, nor is it straight horror.

Unfortunately for me that was not the case. While I expected a strong script, I received a weak one. I found myself correctly guessing what was going to happen next on too many scenes. This movie did not keep me in suspense at all. Therefore, I rule it out as a suspense or a thriller. The movie trailers portrayed it as a horror film which is what I expected and wanted to see. But in the end I asked myself, &quot;What happened? Is that all? Wait a minute, there must be more.&quot; The Johnny Depp character was portrayed with a lack of emotion and complete disinterest. I felt as though Mr. Depp were in a hurry to get it over with. He did nothing whatsoever to impress me with his 2 dimensional portrayal. In several scenes he happens accross the murdered bodies of acquaintences, and has no real emotional reaction whatsoever. C'mon, Johnny! At least pretend you're upset. Jeez! In fact the only character portrayed with any real emotion and feeling was the Frank Langella character and we saw much too little of him on screen, alas. And while the movie itself was wonderfully filmed, I was left feeling empty and hollow. It was as though someone had all this extra money laying around and said, &quot;Hey Roman!&quot;(Roman Polanski) &quot;I got all this extra money laying around. How's about making a movie?&quot; The continuing &quot;buildup&quot; left me waiting for a great conclusion only to be left wondering, &quot;What the heck was that?&quot; In short I feel as though 2 hours of my life have been stolen from me.

482525,ARC5GYVVR3J2V,6305897786,Decimated1184,"[2, 3]","Roman Polanski is without a doubt one of the great directors. His contribution to the genre has not been inconsiderable, having included masterworks like the madness point-of-view film Repulsion (1965) and the highly influential Satanic impregnation film Rosemary's Baby (1968), as well as the lesser known but highly absorbing identity-exchange horror film The Tenant (1976), and one non-starter, his heavy-handed venture into knockabout comedy, The Fearless Vampire Killers/Dance of the Vampires (1967). It is almost impossible to discuss Polanski without ever referring to the shadow his personal life casts - the tragic murder of wife Sharon Tate by the Manson Family in 1967 and his enforced flight from the US in 1980 to avoid charges of having sex with a thirteen year-old girl. And seemingly as though banished from Hollywood and the cinematic mainline, Polanski's career since 1980 has languished in a backwater, lacking the brilliance of his earlier work. There was the standout of Death and the Maiden (1995), but the majority of Polanski's work has been generally forgettable efforts such as Pirates (1986), and Bitter Moon (1992). The Ninth Gate is Polanski's long awaited return to the genre. Polanski has called it his ""Rosemary's Baby meets Eyes Wide Shut"", and has also alluded to his admiration for The Saragossa Manuscript (1965). The Eyes Wide Shut analogy seems a contemporary comparison more than anything else. Like Eyes, Gate features conspiracy societies that lavish in occultic ceremony in scarlet and black hooded robes. But with Eyes Wide Shut, Stanley Kubrick was really deconstructing a whole lineage of secret conspiracy society films rather than being one in itself. Gate does come close to Eyes's image of the robed society really being bored social elite dressing up in that it does briefly make contrast between sinister robed societies and a real Satanism, accusing them of only being play Satanists. Gate also include occasional elements of Saragossa with Polanski playing oddly convoluted games of synchronicity as the illustrations from the book start to play out in actuality. And certainly there is the connection to Rosemary's Baby in that both are films about Satanism, although both are also quite different stories. The film that Gate in fact most resembles is Angel Heart (1987) - both films feature an unbeliever on an detective trail involving the occult for a mysterious wealthy benefactor of dialbolic connections in which each contact made in the course of the investigation keeps getting killed. One was hoping that &quot;Gate&quot;would be a much welcomed return to form for Polanski. But while not a bad film by any means, it sits along there with Pirates as one of Polanski's not-quite-rans. It lacks the absorbing directorial flourishes of films like Repulsion, The Tenant or MacBeth. Certainly there is a good deal of accumulating suspense and paranoia familiar to Polanski films like Rosemary's Baby and The Tenant - sinister images of people watching, a pair of feet outside the window of Russo's basement shop dropping a cigarette as they depart and another pair coming and stomping it out - which gives the film a quite engrossing atmosphere. And it is also filled with intriguingly offbeat background characters - the peculiarly friendly twin brothers who finish each other's sentences; the Baroness's butch secretary; the sinister bodyguard with the dyed-blonde hair; the wheelchair-ridden baroness and her casual mention of bored depravities; and of course the enigmatic, supernaturally-empowered figure of Emmanuelle Seigner's apparent guardian angel. But Polanski, while absorbing one, never really ever gives any of the atmosphere the opportunity to play off in a big flourish. You can't deny the film has you quite enwrapped by the end, but the end is where Polanski oddly falters. We see Depp go off to complete the mystery but the film comes to an inconclusive halt. Deliberate ambiguity is left hanging about exactly who Seigner is. And the final image of Depp departing off through the titular gate in a blaze of light drops a frustrating curtain across the show and keeps its transcendent mysteries all deliberately off-stage.

To its credit,&quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; does not rely on post-MTV &quot;Scream&quot; irony or F/X laden gore. Instead, the movie harkens back to the sort of deliberately paced gothic mystery Polanski once excelled at. Johnny Depp's performance as a chain-smoking, semi-alcoholic &quot;rare book&quot; expert earns the film most of its stars. Depp is hired by a mysterious rich eccentric (Frank Langella, with the ham factor cranked to &quot;11&quot;) to authenticate a volume of satanic incantations that may or may not have been co-authored by ol' &quot;Scratch&quot; himself. Much silly Euro-trash themed intrigue ensues,with a denouement oddly similar to the campy &quot;sacrificial ritual&quot; scene in Stanley Kubrick's &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;.

482528,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6305897786,D. Litton,"[1, 2]","There seems to be an over-abundance of movies that start out good and end up disappointing at the finale. This technique of labeling movies has become mainstream nowadays, as is with films like &quot;The Astronaut's Wife&quot; and &quot;Hackers.&quot; Roman Polanski's latest thriller, &quot;The Ninth Gate,&quot; is a prime example of this, and despite a talented cast and gorgeous settings, it takes too long to deliver a less-than-satisfying ending that leaves viewers with more questions than answers. This is a shame, however, because up until the end, the plot builds up an intense amount of suspense that ultimately fizzles out.The movie opens with a man by the name of Andrew Telfer killing himself in his rather elaborate library of antique texts, and a single book is missing from the shelves. Enter Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), who purchased the missing volume from Telfer and has hired Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) to compare it to others out there in order to be assured of its authenticity. Corso is told that the book is believed to be written by Satan himself, and that there are two copies in different places in Europe. Corso sets out to find them, first stopping by the Telfer estate to question Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) about the circumstances surrounding her husband's death. This leads to attempts by Telfer to retreive the book from Corso, and he flees with the book to Portugal, and then France, in search of the other two books. When he does get his hands on them, he learns that each one is different, but that they each hold a special part of the overall key to hell.Accompany to the plot the menacing Liana Telfer, who is constantly following him, and a mysterious woman who appears out of nowhere at random points to help out Corso. All of this makes for two hours of splendid visuals, and a sense that there is always something spooky going on, even when there should not be. Unlike &quot;End of Days,&quot; this Satanic spoof does not rely on gore and blatant special effects to tell its story. Instead, it uses the viewer's uneasiness to make them feel right at home.However, some might suggest that the film is a bit too long to be enjoyable. I myself found it to be a bit tedious in certain places, but when you think you're about to drop off into a slumber, something will happen to keep you in the story once again. It is the ending, and what comes to pass to Corso because of his work, that will come as a shocking letdown. It will leave you with more questions than answers.Acting talent is terrific. Depp seems perfectly cast as the sleepy Dean Corso, always on his feet without a break. Frank Langella is a good Boris Balkan, the man who becomes so insatiably obsessed with Satanic ritual. Olin gives a good performance as Telfer, who keeps Corso on his feet while she attempts to recover the book. And the guardian &quot;angel&quot; is played with mystery and sinister integrity by Emmanuelle Seigner.Roman Polanski has done a fine job of bringing this very macabre picture of the doorway to hell to the screen, but trust me on this: you'll find yourself wanting to close it.",3,This gateway to hell is ultimately disappointing.,977270400,"12 20, 2000",2000,3114,"['be', 'over-abundance', 'movies', 'start', 'out', 'good', 'end', 'up', 'disappointing', 'finale', 'technique', 'labeling', 'movies', 'become', 'mainstream', 'nowadays', 'films', 'quot', 'Astronaut', 'Wife', 'quot', 'quot', 'Hackers.', 'quot', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'latest', 'thriller', 'quot', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'quot', 'prime', 'example', 'talented', 'cast', 'gorgeous', 'settings', 'too', 'long', 'deliver', 'less-than-satisfying', 'ending', 'viewers', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'shame', 'however', 'end', 'plot', 'up', 'intense', 'amount', 'suspense', 'ultimately', 'out.The', 'movie', 'man', 'name', 'Andrew', 'Telfer', 'killing', 'rather', 'elaborate', 'library', 'antique', 'texts', 'single', 'book', 'missing', 'shelves', 'Enter', 'Boris', 'Balkan', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'who', 'purchased', 'missing', 'volume', 'Telfer', 'hired', 'Dean', 'Corso', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'compare', 'others', 'out', 'there', 'order', 'be', 'assured', 'authenticity', 'Corso', 'told', 'book', 'believed', 'be', 'written', 'Satan', 'are', 'two', 'copies', 'different', 'places', 'Europe', 'Corso', 'out', 'find', 'first', 'stopping', 'Telfer', 'estate', 'question', 'Liana', 'Telfer', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'circumstances', 'surrounding', 'husband', 'death', 'attempts', 'Telfer', 'retreive', 'book', 'Corso', 'book', 'Portugal', 'then', 'France', 'search', 'other', 'two', 'books', 'When', 'get', 'hands', 'one', 'different', 'hold', 'special', 'part', 'overall', 'key', 'hell.Accompany', 'plot', 'menacing', 'Liana', 'Telfer', 'who', 'constantly', 'following', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'who', 'nowhere', 'random', 'points', 'help', 'out', 'Corso', 'two', 'hours', 'splendid', 'visuals', 'sense', 'always', 'something', 'spooky', 'going', 'even', 'when', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'Unlike', 'quot', 'End', 'Days', 'quot', 'Satanic', 'spoof', 'not', 'rely', 'gore', 'blatant', 'special', 'effects', 'tell', 'story', 'Instead', 'viewer', 'uneasiness', 'make', 'feel', 'right', 'home.However', 'might', 'suggest', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'found', 'be', 'bit', 'tedious', 'certain', 'places', 'when', 'think', ""'re"", 'drop', 'off', 'slumber', 'something', 'will', 'happen', 'keep', 'story', 'once', 'again', 'ending', 'what', 'pass', 'Corso', 'work', 'will', 'come', 'shocking', 'letdown', 'will', 'leave', 'more', 'questions', 'answers.Acting', 'talent', 'terrific', 'Depp', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'sleepy', 'Dean', 'Corso', 'always', 'feet', 'break', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'good', 'Boris', 'Balkan', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'insatiably', 'obsessed', 'Satanic', 'ritual', 'Olin', 'good', 'performance', 'Telfer', 'who', 'Corso', 'feet', 'recover', 'book', 'guardian', 'quot', 'quot', 'played', 'mystery', 'sinister', 'integrity', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner.Roman', 'Polanski', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'bringing', 'very', 'macabre', 'picture', 'doorway', 'hell', 'screen', 'trust', ""'ll"", 'find', 'wanting', 'close']",The Ninth Gate

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 1]","The physical violence in Roman Polanski's THE NINTH GATGE is so campy and melodramatic it reminds me of. . .Hitchcock.  Polanski is far too superb a filmmaker to half bake the scuffles and fisticuffs unintentionally; to me, it looks to be a throwback to the melodramatic silliness that Hitchcock presented in his films of half a century ago.  I kept waiting for flocks of birds to descend and add to the mayhem confronting our protagonist, but I digress.  THE NINTH GATE is a quirky mixture of suspense, thrills, and a tongue-in-cheek nod to the occult; with Johnny Depp in the lead playing a bewildered and harassed book collector realizing his current gig to authenticate a rare book is approaching the metaphysical realm, this is one fun ride.Three copies of a very rare, very old, book--a book allegedly co-written by the Dark Lord himself; book ""detective"" Dean Corso (Depp) is hired by an eccentric millionaire (a cheeky Frank Langella) to compare his copy to the other two copies in Europe.  Problem is, people start dying as Corso conducts his investigation--and Corso himself constantly faces deadly peril, only to be saved, again and again, by a nameless femme fatale in need of some shampoo (Emmanuelle Seigner).  Corso is stalked, hounded, assaulted, pursued, and then the copy he's been carrying is stolen.  Corso and his companion in turn pursue the thieves, only to find themselves in a country lair with some serious Beezlebub revelers.  Corso's malevolent employer himself appears at the festivities, retrieves the book, and the true deal with the Devil takes place.  The meaning of THE NINTH GATE is revealed, with Corso experiencing a very close encounter with the dark side.  Depp is eccentric, quirky, dazed, and confused; THE NINTH GATE is a satisfying suspense tale, with a possible tribute to the keystone cops physicality of a bygone era.--D.

This current offering came along 30 years after that masterpiece, and while 'The Ninth Gate' is not up there with with Polanski's highest tier work, it's a good enough film combining rare books, European flair, and a sense of adventure. The overall feeling evoked during the first half reminds me of a sophisticated 'giallo' along the lines of Dario Argento's best work. Aside from the European flavor, there is a bevy of odd characters, with too much money and odd sexual appetites, combined with a few other shadowy figures. The overall look of the film leans towards late afternoon and twilight hours, which suit the plot perfectly.Johnny Depp plays New York based book dealer Dean Corso, who is commissioned by wealthy dealer Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), owner of one copy of an exotic manuscript(titled 'The Ninth Gate', naturally), to track down two remaining copies of this work. There are others, with their own agendas, who would also like to get their hands on the remaining manuscripts, which are located in Europe, and provide a setting for some great plot twists throughout Paris and the Iberian peninsula.  Mysterious deaths lead to a double climax, which offers fairly good resolution, but ultimately seems a bit contrived and over-the-top, although it does suggest that Dean Corso's inner soul might become the next portal to the Prince of Darkness.The acting is generally of high caliber, with Depp and Langella leading the pack. Supporting roles, especially the women, are nicely handled. Had this film been directed by a novice, or someone without Polanski's credentials, it might have served as a career booster. As it is, none of the thespians cut quite the distinctive path that Mia Farrow and Ruth Gordon did in 1968, when Lucifer's bambino came into the world.  Nonetheless, pour yourself a nice glass of Cabernet, watch the sun go down, and enjoy this movie for what it is.The Blu-Ray picture is nicely defined, but extras on the Blu-Ray disc are identical to the original issue, meaning brief interviews, and a worthwhile Polanski commentary.

The Ninth Gate is way more enjoyable than iconic movies like Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.  There is unjustified over-analysis of this movie, which stifles enjoyment.The cinematography was excellent, justifying the wide-screen.  The DTS soundtrack was impressive.  Colour saturation was intense, putting the Blu-ray to good effect.  Comments on the Blu-ray version having washed out colours are groundless.  When light streams in behind the actors through library and caf&eacute; windows, there is going to be less colour in areas lit by shafts of light: photography 101.  There are a lot of scenes taking place in libraries, and there is a lot of backlighting in the movie.  There is no colour washout at all: the skin tones are outstanding, as confirmed by the bare bodies of Lena Olin and Emmanuelle Seigner.Lack of features?  Roman Polanski's detailed and non-stop commentary was the best I have heard in a very long time - it is virtually an instructional lecture on movie making.  This commentary, pleasantly, is never once self-serving or self-congratulatory.  It incorporates into the narrative all the relevant material normally found in ""Special Features"".  Besides one gets to watch this marvellous movie one more time, the original feature not having boring moments helps making this exhaustive commentary readily consumable.  The drawings in ""Special Features"" have characters bearing an uncanny resemblance to various actors.Unresolved ending?  Roman Polanski wisely leaves the final encounter between Johnny Depp and the Prince of Darkness to the viewer's imagination.  To be fair, no movie interpretation can possibly come out right, nor can any good come out of it.This Blu-ray does not work on the old Sony BDP-300, but is playable with models Sony BDP-350 and later 2.0 BDPs.Many movies give the feeling ""I could have written this script myself"" or ""another variation of a worn theme"".

482541,A1PY4BCMI543EX,6305897786,E. Barrios,"[2, 2]","Let's face it: Polanski has five, maybe six, movies that have brought him fame in his long career, and ""The Ninth Gate"" isn't one of them. While I enjoyed the intrigue and the riddles behind the engravings found in ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows"", I didn't care for the ambiguity I felt when the credits rolled up. Polanski has left a few obvious questions unanswered, and based on some of the reviews I've read here, I'm not alone in this boat.SPOILER ALERT:To break through my confusion, I had to watch the DVD a few times and read the screenplay. I'm not going to state that I understand the minutiae of TNG, but I think where I'm at in understanding the movie, it's good enough for me.One big question mark for me and many others was the identity of ""The Girl"" with blond hair. Was she ""The Whore of Babylon"" as some have claimed, or a ""witch"" in league with the Devil? Based on clues I've dug up mostly in the script and what I saw in the film, I'm convinced she is the Devil.Another unanswered question had to do with Andrew Telfer's suicide. Why did he hang himself? Polanski provides a not-so-obvious clue by using the character of Baroness Kessler to state, ""If he ever finds out what his wife gets up to in these gatherings, he'll probably kill himself."" Moreover, it's my opinion Telfer found out his wife only married him for his money and to further her Satanic pursuits.There's more but I won't go into it in this review. Half the fun of watching the movie is in trying to figure out what's happening. And that's what Polanski wants you to do. But I think he enjoys trying to be clever and it shows in TNG, but someone should tell him he's really not, and in trying to be clever, he's made the film ambiguous enough where the masses want to tune out.",3,Intriguing & Ambiguous,1370044800,"06 1, 2013",2013,1775,"['Let', 'face', 'Polanski', 'five', 'maybe', 'six', 'movies', 'have', 'brought', 'fame', 'long', 'career', 'Ninth', 'Gate', ""n't"", 'one', 'enjoyed', 'intrigue', 'riddles', 'engravings', 'found', 'Nine', 'Gates', 'Kingdom', 'Shadows', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'ambiguity', 'felt', 'when', 'credits', 'rolled', 'up', 'Polanski', 'left', 'few', 'obvious', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'based', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'here', ""'m"", 'not', 'alone', 'boat.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'break', 'confusion', 'had', 'watch', 'DVD', 'few', 'times', 'read', 'screenplay', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'state', 'understand', 'minutiae', 'TNG', 'think', 'where', ""'m"", 'understanding', 'movie', 'good', 'enough', 'me.One', 'big', 'question', 'mark', 'many', 'others', 'was', 'identity', 'Girl', 'blond', 'hair', 'Was', 'Whore', 'Babylon', 'have', 'claimed', 'witch', 'league', 'Devil', 'Based', 'clues', ""'ve"", 'dug', 'up', 'mostly', 'script', 'what', 'saw', 'film', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'Devil.Another', 'unanswered', 'question', 'had', 'do', 'Andrew', 'Telfer', 'suicide', 'Why', 'did', 'hang', 'Polanski', 'not-so-obvious', 'clue', 'using', 'character', 'Baroness', 'Kessler', 'state', 'ever', 'out', 'what', 'wife', 'up', 'gatherings', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'kill', 'Moreover', 'opinion', 'Telfer', 'found', 'out', 'wife', 'only', 'married', 'money', 'further', 'Satanic', 'pursuits.There', 'more', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'review', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'what', 'Polanski', 'do', 'think', 'trying', 'be', 'clever', 'TNG', 'someone', 'should', 'tell', 'really', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'clever', 'made', 'film', 'ambiguous', 'enough', 'where', 'masses', 'want', 'tune', 'out']",The Ninth Gate

482543,A3M3FG82ZE1J8I,6305897786,"Ed N ""Ed""","[10, 13]","Roman Polanski is a bit of a bizarre filmmaker who tends to make rather macabre and gloomy films.  His &quot;The Tenant&quot; and &quot;Repulsion&quot; illustrate this trait rather bluntly.  And so it is  with his latest offering, &quot;The Ninth Gate,&quot; as well.  The film  looks like a Roman Polanski film right from the very start, with its muted  hues, supernatural themes, and depressing atmosphere.  For some reason, all  of Polanski's films are quite depressing. Oh well.Anyhow, the film  concerns an egocentric book mercenary (for lack of a better term), played  by Johnny Depp, who is hired by an avid and mysterious book collector  (Frank Langella) to authenticate his copy of a very rare and potentially  very powerful book.  The investigation takes Depp's detective all  throughout Europe, and we meet some quite eccentric characters along the  way who fit in perfectly with Polanski's style.  My personal favorites are  an amusing pair of twin book-keepers who shed some light on the book.  There is also a mysterious woman who seems to follow Depp's every steps.  What is her agenda?  Did Langella hire her to keep an eye on Depp?  What is  her interest in the book?  I won't tell - watch the film and find  out.&quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; is rather deliberately paced.  Some TV  ads had depicted it to be a fast-paced, explosion packed, sexual romp.  This is the exact opposite of what the film really is.  The film really  takes its time developing mood and supernatural tone, and for the most  part, it succeeds.  If you're patient and allow the film to establish  itself, then you'll probably enjoy this film.  Unfortunately, most viewers,  jaded by MTV or Hollywood-style quick-editing, may find this movie too  boring and tedious.  That is a pity. Polanski belongs to an old school of  filmmaking, like the late Stanley Kubrick, wherein the craft of the  filmmaking process itself is more important than the number of blockbusting  special effects one can pack in.I found this film to be quite intriguing  and gripping.  It falters a little at the conclusion by becoming perhaps a  little too over-the-top, but overall it is a fine work by a master  filmmaker.As for the newly-released DVD, I have a few comments.  The  picture and sound are quite good, though not reference quality.  There is a  slight graininess to the picture, but that is deliberate and was also  evident on the actual theatrical release (just as in Kubrick's Eyes Wide  Shut, too).  The subwoofers stay quiet for the most part, but then this is  not a loud film (until the ending, anyways).  Polanski contributes a  commentary track, but I find him a little dry and difficult to understand;  I could have used subtitles with him, perhaps.  Unfortunately, there are  *no* subtitles on this DVD.  The disc contains the usual cast/production  notes info and a variety of trailer/teasers, a few of which are Easter Eggs  but nothing special.  There is a nice isolated soundtrack for the score,  though, which is rather eloquent and sets the proper mood for the film.  And there is a small storyboard section and a gallery of artwork from the  film, too.  Overall, it is a well produced DVD, though I would have liked a  few more extras on the DVD.  Still if you liked the film, you'll be happy  enough with this DVD.",4,A Decent Film by Roman Polanski,963878400,"07 18, 2000",2000,3307,"['Roman', 'Polanski', 'bit', 'bizarre', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'make', 'rather', 'macabre', 'gloomy', 'films', 'quot', 'Tenant', 'quot', 'quot', 'Repulsion', 'quot', 'illustrate', 'trait', 'rather', 'bluntly', 'latest', 'offering', 'quot', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'quot', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'film', 'right', 'very', 'start', 'muted', 'hues', 'supernatural', 'themes', 'depressing', 'atmosphere', 'reason', 'Polanski', 'films', 'are', 'quite', 'depressing', 'Oh', 'well.Anyhow', 'film', 'concerns', 'egocentric', 'book', 'mercenary', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'who', 'hired', 'avid', 'mysterious', 'book', 'collector', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'authenticate', 'copy', 'very', 'rare', 'potentially', 'very', 'powerful', 'book', 'investigation', 'Depp', 'detective', 'Europe', 'meet', 'quite', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'way', 'who', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'Polanski', 'style', 'personal', 'favorites', 'are', 'amusing', 'pair', 'twin', 'book-keepers', 'who', 'shed', 'light', 'book', 'also', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'who', 'follow', 'Depp', 'steps', 'What', 'agenda', 'Did', 'Langella', 'hire', 'keep', 'eye', 'Depp', 'What', 'interest', 'book', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'watch', 'film', 'find', 'out.', 'quot', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'quot', 'rather', 'deliberately', 'paced', 'TV', 'ads', 'had', 'depicted', 'be', 'fast-paced', 'explosion', 'packed', 'sexual', 'romp', 'exact', 'opposite', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'film', 'really', 'time', 'developing', 'mood', 'supernatural', 'tone', 'most', 'part', ""'re"", 'patient', 'allow', 'film', 'establish', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'viewers', 'jaded', 'MTV', 'Hollywood-style', 'quick-editing', 'may', 'find', 'movie', 'too', 'boring', 'tedious', 'pity', 'Polanski', 'old', 'school', 'filmmaking', 'late', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'wherein', 'craft', 'filmmaking', 'process', 'more', 'important', 'number', 'blockbusting', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'can', 'pack', 'in.I', 'film', 'be', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'gripping', 'little', 'conclusion', 'becoming', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'overall', 'fine', 'work', 'master', 'filmmaker.As', 'newly-released', 'DVD', 'have', 'few', 'comments', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'not', 'reference', 'quality', 'slight', 'graininess', 'picture', 'deliberate', 'was', 'also', 'evident', 'actual', 'theatrical', 'release', 'just', 'Kubrick', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'too', 'subwoofers', 'stay', 'quiet', 'most', 'part', 'then', 'not', 'loud', 'film', 'ending', 'anyways', 'Polanski', 'commentary', 'track', 'find', 'little', 'dry', 'difficult', 'understand', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'subtitles', 'perhaps', 'Unfortunately', 'are', '*no*', 'subtitles', 'DVD', 'disc', 'usual', 'cast/production', 'notes', 'info', 'variety', 'trailer/teasers', 'few', 'are', 'Easter', 'Eggs', 'nothing', 'special', 'nice', 'isolated', 'soundtrack', 'score', 'rather', 'eloquent', 'proper', 'mood', 'film', 'small', 'storyboard', 'section', 'gallery', 'artwork', 'film', 'too', 'Overall', 'well', 'produced', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'few', 'more', 'extras', 'DVD', 'Still', 'liked', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'enough', 'DVD']",The Ninth Gate

The plot is predictable up until the ending, which is quite startling (and disturbing), but this is not a negative.  It is largely a mood piece, built  around the connotations of occultism, drawing on our own relgious  prejudices to frighten us and to get us thinking about their lack of  complexity (it doesn't, apparently, frighten us, but for the most  fundamentally devout who take these matters seriously).  Aside from  Polanski's sometimes uncomforable portrayl of women (always the Eve in his  films), what is genuis here is Polanski's use of the  ""sex-and-satanism"" theme without risking b-movie takiness. One  should take a glance at the other reviews for a plot summary; here I will  only say that one should not put all her eggs in the plot basket.  See the  film as a nice, eerie, sometimes funny, mood-making event, and you will  enjoy the visual puzzles. I'll also add somewhat of  a spoiler (READ NO FURTHER UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM) . . . if you read Depp's characer as a fallen demon who is being called ""home,"" his motivation (and the movie) falls into place.I should also mention, however, the the DVD version  misrepresents the special features.

482549,AHB9THAKIF5CN,6305897786,Five Angels,"[1, 2]","Unlike the modern film makers that rely on special effects and a surplus of sexual provocation to continue their income status, The Ninth Gate is a throw-back or old school visit back to the times when a film had good acting, a solid/interesting plot, and inventive filming techniques (a quality musical score, as well). Roman Polanski lives up to his reputation with this worthy celluloid adventure.Johnny Depp, Lena Olin, Frank Langella and several other notable actors do an admirable job in playing out this tale that shares intrigue, subtle comedy, and sarcasm. The theme revolves around a ethically-challenged rare book expert, Johnny Depp, that ekes a living by swindling unsuspecting owners from their valuable collections. Eventually, he is retained by a collector to evaluate and establish that his prize piece, a book co-written by Lucifer, himself, is the one and only and that the other two existing books are fakes/copies. Well, let the intrigue begin there and I won't spoil it by providing details. I will say, however, that plot involves such characters as devil worshippers, eccentric debutantes, dubious and unscrupulous book afficianados; all with one thing in common: their desire to obtain these books and the secrets held within.So all are aware, this film has a lot of aspects to it and is interesting because of that, but it is not a fast paced, blur through events. Polanski spends ample time developing the plot so the viewer understands the issues being researched (the devil is in the details, you know). You will follow along with Mr. Depp's character as he investigates the authenticity of these ancient works and the subversive attempts to corrupt his intentions. If you are as interested as I and you are analytical of nature, you will pick up on some of the interesting foreshadowing and premise for the story. There are some things left unexplained, (I cannot explain them myself until I read the book for which this is based) but that is what is so appealing of this work - some of the plot is obvious, some revolves around comedic purposes, and some remains opaque. Finally, the film is shot on location in Prague, Paris, Spain and several picturesque places.In every aspect, this film is a worthy view. You will enjoy the quality of each component of a film with The Ninth Gate. There's much to enjoy, just be an appreciate mood while watching.

He is a unique actor who provides great depth to scenes through his expressions as well as his portrayal. That is never more evident than in &#34;The Ninth Gate&#34;. A combination mystery thriller with just a hint of the supernatural that grows during the story to be the climatic confrontations.If you consider the movie for your entertainment just be aware that there are some nudity and sexual situations that really do not detract from the mystery story but certainly must have added a factor that greatly added to Depp's enjoyment while on the job.The story itself tends to do what I consider considerable &#34;over-laying&#34; and that approach causes the audience (in this case, moi) to have to continually sort out who is who and doing what - but of course that is the very essence of mysteries. The story has a touch of the naivety found in &#34;Rosemary's Baby&#34; with the principal character (Depp) being confused by events at every turn while he struggles to succeed in discovering the puzzle pieces and to make the necessary connections to move the story along. At points the story displays turns that really should have called for higher production values than those captured in the film but I am sure the budget and the producers were watching their shekels as always.Again, if you enjoy Johnny Depp's work as an actor this piece will not disappoint.

So, if a word or two is misspelled, our apologies.FYI Part 2: If you have read ""The DaVinci Code"", then perhaps your choice as Robert Langdon would have been Depp, due to his role in this movie.  I thought so anyways.The acting is on par with a movie such as this.  It's hard to define this as a ""new"" classic or something TCM is going to be airing alongside ""Rosemary's Baby"" as a Thriller Mini-Thon.  However, from the opening sequence to the subject matter, it does a relatively good job at addressing a book in which ""Satan himself"" authored.Frank Langella had a ton of acting chops back in the late 70s, but with this being the only possible exception, he seems to rather be stuck in typecast roles.  Another good actor that apparently prefers this is the underrated, and highly underused Hector Elizondo.  Frank plays Depp's ""employer"" only in the financial sense.  He gets Depp to check on the validity of two other copies of the same book in the hopes he (Langella) has the authentic version.Extensive knowledge of the occult, the devil, or the actual meanings of Lucifer is not needed to have a good time with this movie.  Considering most movies that are made from novels don't necessarily market themselves to the literary students and historians around the world, it's hard to imagine needing to bone up on the topic before viewing.

Very!First of all, we're talking about a basic premise in which we, the audience, are asked to beleive that the devil himself signed drawings in a series of ""ancient manuscripts"".  And that these 400 year-old manuscripts are in pristine condition, looking like they've never even been opened (or photocopied or had cigarette ash dropped on them by former owners, etc).  A suspension of disbelief is absolutely necessary!There's the 'guardian angel' or 'guardian devil' should we say, in the mysterious 'woman' who keeps appearing to help him out of various difficulties and who finally leads him to reach 'the ninth gate'.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The pacing was steady and suspenseful.  The filming was obviously the work of a master.  I loved that we got to 'go to Europe' for the second half of the movie.  The ending was the only problem for me.  I hear people debating both ways - cop-out or stroke of genius?  I'm bound to think the former is more accurate.  However, if we are to beleive that the sudden fade to white is a sudden bringing of the audience into the consciousness of Johny Depp as he enters the ninth gate... well..  It still seems to me like he just couldn't think of any better way to end it.  After all, the movie's been promising to 'raise the devil' for almost two hours and finally we are left with this?  I was a bit let down, whether I should or shouldn't have been.  Still, maybe that was the best way to end it.

482580,A32CY1SIECVT9I,6305897786,James H. Wilson,"[7, 10]","It has been a while since Roman Polanski has created a good movie.  In the Ninth Gate Polanski shows us that he still has the knack for turning out an attractive and interesting film.  The Ninth Gate is a neat razor cut out of a wonderful but convoluted book, The Club Dumas.  The concept of a banned book from the 17th century slowly emerges out of a quest to authenticate a part of The Three Musketeers.In the Ninth Gate our mercenary ""hero"" played by Johnny Depp is immediatly put in harm's way with a charge to authenticate a book supposedly co-authored by the devil. Polanksi skillfully leads us into a suspensful mystery that mid-way through begins to get atmospheric and supernatural.What the movie does not do is toss buckets of blood into the viewer's face as a idiot's version of horror and suspense.  What the movie does do is lead one deeper and deeper into a eerie and scary world of ruthless people and the creepy thought that the book might actually be written by the Devil.  The music is at once beautiful and atmospheric. The supporting cast is perfect, especially Frank Langella who is haughty and villanous.  We are also treated to Emmanualle Seigner who let us think she is an angel, or a demon, or a familiar.The DVD version has a voice over commentary by Polanski who explains the ins and out of the film.

482584,A2NCTHIZTDG4DJ,6305897786,J. Bollen,"[1, 5]","The promotions for this film made it out to be a fast-paced, rock video devil hunter yarn.  Instead, it is has a relaxing pace and a fairly quiet tone while still keeping the audience on their toes.The biggest complaints about this film always come from the MTV generation.  If you want more action and demon-fighting, watch Spawn or End of Days.  I actually enjoyed those two, but that's another story.  There are always those who complain about films that don't take off as soon as they begin and last more than 1 1/2 hours.  Here's my advice to them: just sit still and pay attention for Christ's sake.I always love a break from the pure, fair-haired, boyish hero type.  The Ninth Gate gives the audience a protagonist that some may dislike, but grow to like him as he actually becomes an even worse person during the film's progress.  No actor on this earth could have portrayed Dean Corso better than Johnny Depp.  The gifted Depp seamlessly blends sarcasm, violence, style, and charm into the mercenary book detective.Corso's ally (Emmanuelle Seigner) appears in the form of a beautiful but plainly dressed wandering college student with supernatural powers.  With time, she proves herself to be a trustworthy protector and a perfect match for Corso.  Seigner's performance is comparable to Depp's, as her character's personality parallels Corso's to a certain degree.Frank Langella is also noteworthy of his portrayal of business tycoon Boris Balkan.  Langella lends a strictly professional and calm attitude to his character, but also gives him a hint of eccentricity and a cold, forbidding, and dangerous side that Corso crosses midway through the film.The plot is very original and only grows greater with a well-written script and an eerie, beautiful soundtrack.  The acting is superb, as already described.  The special effects are masterfully done.  Most do not understand the film's finale, and the commentary by Polanski makes it clear that he desires it to remain a mystery.  In a nutshell, though, the image of Corso walking toward the castle suggests that his adventure is just beginning and he is entering even more dangerous territory than before.  Corso's &quot;angel&quot; even tells him near the end that the game is over for Balkan, but not for him.In conclusion, this film is incredible and highly recommended to those who enjoy a leisurely paced thriller.",5,Shear Brilliance.,1010793600,"01 12, 2002",2002,2381,"['promotions', 'film', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'fast-paced', 'rock', 'video', 'devil', 'hunter', 'yarn', 'Instead', 'relaxing', 'pace', 'fairly', 'quiet', 'tone', 'still', 'keeping', 'audience', 'toes.The', 'biggest', 'complaints', 'film', 'always', 'come', 'MTV', 'generation', 'want', 'more', 'action', 'demon-fighting', 'watch', 'Spawn', 'End', 'Days', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'two', 'story', 'are', 'always', 'who', 'complain', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'off', 'as', 'soon', 'begin', 'last', 'more', '1', '1/2', 'hours', 'Here', 'advice', 'just', 'sit', 'still', 'pay', 'attention', 'Christ', 'sake.I', 'always', 'love', 'break', 'pure', 'fair-haired', 'boyish', 'hero', 'type', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'audience', 'protagonist', 'may', 'dislike', 'grow', 'like', 'actually', 'even', 'worse', 'person', 'film', 'progress', 'actor', 'earth', 'could', 'have', 'portrayed', 'Dean', 'Corso', 'better', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'gifted', 'Depp', 'seamlessly', 'sarcasm', 'violence', 'style', 'charm', 'mercenary', 'book', 'detective.Corso', 'ally', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner', 'form', 'beautiful', 'plainly', 'dressed', 'wandering', 'college', 'student', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'time', 'be', 'trustworthy', 'protector', 'perfect', 'match', 'Corso', 'Seigner', 'performance', 'comparable', 'Depp', 'character', 'personality', 'Corso', 'certain', 'degree.Frank', 'Langella', 'also', 'noteworthy', 'portrayal', 'business', 'tycoon', 'Boris', 'Balkan', 'Langella', 'strictly', 'professional', 'calm', 'attitude', 'character', 'also', 'hint', 'eccentricity', 'cold', 'forbidding', 'dangerous', 'side', 'Corso', 'midway', 'film.The', 'plot', 'very', 'original', 'only', 'grows', 'greater', 'well-written', 'script', 'eerie', 'beautiful', 'soundtrack', 'acting', 'superb', 'already', 'described', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'masterfully', 'done', 'Most', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'film', 'finale', 'commentary', 'Polanski', 'clear', 'remain', 'mystery', 'nutshell', 'though', 'image', 'Corso', 'walking', 'castle', 'adventure', 'just', 'beginning', 'entering', 'even', 'more', 'dangerous', 'territory', 'before', 'Corso', 'quot', 'quot', 'even', 'end', 'game', 'over', 'Balkan', 'not', 'him.In', 'conclusion', 'film', 'incredible', 'highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'enjoy', 'leisurely', 'paced', 'thriller']",The Ninth Gate

482588,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,6305897786,Jeff  Farrow,"[4, 6]","[This is the last review in my 31 Days of Halloween 2008 series. It's been fun going down Tombstone Lane & I want to thank you for taking the time to read these humble & horrific offerings. I hope you've had some fun too. I'm already looking forward to next year. More tales of terror & darkness to explore!]Jumpin' J Lucifer, it looks like every Magus & Magatrix on the planet have reveiwed THE NINTH GATE--and some of the naughty kids actually gave the whole plot away.I'll try to be both brief & discreet.The teaming up of Roman Polanski & Johnny Depp was surely a pact made in hell--and I mean that in a GOOD way. Polanski's near obsession with the Diobolical Side often translate into memorable images on film. There are some obvious Satanic images in THE NINTH GATE, and others not so obvious.Johnny Depp deftly plays the role of rare book investigator. It's nice to watch him play a more or less normal human being for a change. There's a very short sequence in the film I really enjoyed: Johnny Depp is waiting in a line (for something, I forgot what--short term memory loss, please bear with me.) Anyway, a little girl is standing next to him, giving him the evil eye. Depp looks down at her and does a very funny Johny Depp sort of double take. It was really cute--and I mean that in a nice way too.Other cast members were excellent as well.On one level the theme of the film is how to conjure up The Living Devil a la ROSEMARY'S BABY. There is another, perhaps more subtle interpretation, i.e. performance of The Great Work. The Great Work is alchemical rather than Satanic. The Great Work is based on positive spiritual concepts like the Gnostic sacrament of The Sacred Marriage; the Hindu Kundalini Yoga, Bhakti Yoga--and, in particular, Tantra Yoga, the Union of Shiva & Shakti.And that's all of the plot I'm going to reveal.The wonderful woodcut images on the pages of the much coveted book in the film are great. I like the way they look & play into the action.[See MERCURIUS The Marriage of Heaven & Earth in the links list below.]Another thing I liked about the movie is how Polanski makes fun of the wealthy Satanists' ridiculous pretentions. To miss that point is to miss the whole thing--and yet the viewer is still left (as in Left-Hand Path) with a reaffirmation that the Key to this Theory of Everything is Lucifer. To many people (who aren't necessarily Satanists), Lucifer represents, the Bringer of Light, a Promethian figure who is actually on the side of humanity in the Struggle for Existence. I  can rate with the mythology of being kicked on the butt out of Heaven.I'll end here with a warning: Watch out for any edited versions of the film. I've seen one on the tube that not only cut out the cute sequence with the little girl, but butchered the sexual images at the conclusion--a desecration that completely demolished the whole point of the movie's theme.Well, that's it.HAVE A HAPPY & HORROR-FILLED HALLOWEEN!Regards,JEFarrowMercurius: The Marriage of Heaven and EarthCarnival Of Lost SoulsRosemary's BabyThe Fearless Vampire Killers, or Pardon Me but Your Teeth Are in My NeckWhat's Eating Gilbert Grape (Special Collector's Edition)Zombies: A Field Guide to the Walking DeadDaimonic Reality: A Field Guide to the OtherworldLuciferian Witchcraft",5,Devil in a Red Dress,1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,3283,"['[', 'last', 'review', '31', 'Days', 'Halloween', '2008', 'series', 'been', 'fun', 'going', 'down', 'Tombstone', 'Lane', 'want', 'thank', 'taking', 'time', 'read', 'humble', 'horrific', 'offerings', 'hope', ""'ve"", 'had', 'fun', 'too', ""'m"", 'already', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'year', 'More', 'tales', 'terror', 'darkness', 'explore', ']', 'Jumpin', 'J', 'Lucifer', 'Magus', 'Magatrix', 'planet', 'have', 'reveiwed', 'THE', 'NINTH', 'GATE', 'naughty', 'kids', 'actually', 'gave', 'whole', 'plot', 'away.I', ""'ll"", 'try', 'be', 'brief', 'discreet.The', 'teaming', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'was', 'surely', 'pact', 'made', 'hell', 'mean', 'GOOD', 'way', 'Polanski', 'near', 'obsession', 'Diobolical', 'Side', 'often', 'translate', 'memorable', 'images', 'film', 'are', 'obvious', 'Satanic', 'images', 'THE', 'NINTH', 'GATE', 'others', 'not', 'so', 'obvious.Johnny', 'Depp', 'deftly', 'role', 'rare', 'book', 'investigator', 'nice', 'watch', 'play', 'more', 'less', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'change', 'very', 'short', 'sequence', 'film', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'waiting', 'line', 'something', 'forgot', 'what', 'short', 'term', 'memory', 'loss', 'please', 'bear', 'Anyway', 'little', 'girl', 'standing', 'next', 'giving', 'evil', 'eye', 'Depp', 'down', 'very', 'funny', 'Johny', 'Depp', 'sort', 'double', 'take', 'was', 'really', 'cute', 'mean', 'nice', 'way', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'excellent', 'well.On', 'one', 'level', 'theme', 'film', 'how', 'conjure', 'up', 'Living', 'Devil', 'la', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'perhaps', 'more', 'subtle', 'interpretation', 'i.e', 'performance', 'Great', 'Work', 'Great', 'Work', 'alchemical', 'rather', 'Satanic', 'Great', 'Work', 'based', 'positive', 'spiritual', 'concepts', 'Gnostic', 'sacrament', 'Sacred', 'Marriage', 'Hindu', 'Kundalini', 'Yoga', 'Bhakti', 'Yoga', 'particular', 'Tantra', 'Yoga', 'Union', 'Shiva', 'Shakti.And', 'plot', ""'m"", 'going', 'reveal.The', 'wonderful', 'woodcut', 'images', 'pages', 'much', 'coveted', 'book', 'film', 'are', 'great', 'way', 'look', 'play', 'action', 'See', 'MERCURIUS', 'Marriage', 'Heaven', 'Earth', 'links', 'list', ']', 'thing', 'liked', 'movie', 'how', 'Polanski', 'fun', 'wealthy', 'Satanists', 'ridiculous', 'pretentions', 'miss', 'point', 'miss', 'whole', 'thing', 'yet', 'viewer', 'still', 'left', 'Left-Hand', 'Path', 'reaffirmation', 'Key', 'Theory', 'Everything', 'Lucifer', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'Lucifer', 'Bringer', 'Light', 'Promethian', 'figure', 'who', 'actually', 'side', 'humanity', 'Struggle', 'Existence', 'can', 'rate', 'mythology', 'being', 'kicked', 'butt', 'Heaven.I', ""'ll"", 'end', 'here', 'warning', 'Watch', 'out', 'edited', 'versions', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'tube', 'not', 'only', 'cut', 'out', 'cute', 'sequence', 'little', 'girl', 'butchered', 'sexual', 'images', 'conclusion', 'desecration', 'completely', 'demolished', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'theme.Well', 'it.HAVE', 'A', 'HAPPY', 'HORROR-FILLED', 'HALLOWEEN', 'Regards', 'JEFarrowMercurius', 'Marriage', 'Heaven', 'EarthCarnival', 'Lost', 'SoulsRosemary', 'BabyThe', 'Fearless', 'Vampire', 'Killers', 'Pardon', 'Me', 'Teeth', 'Are', 'My', 'NeckWhat', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Field', 'Guide', 'Walking', 'DeadDaimonic', 'Reality', 'Field', 'Guide', 'OtherworldLuciferian', 'Witchcraft']",The Ninth Gate

It is a film that I love, but understand that it is not an interesting movie for others. Things I really appreciate, like the anti-movement against rapid cut scenes and numerous close ups, is like a life-saving suck of air for me. A movie about books, that appreciate and put on-screen the finer qualities such as detail shots of the type and illustrations. I see far too many movies today that remind me of what microsoft and apple want the future to be. This movie is like a valentine to book lovers like me, and it is another reason why I adore this movie.The blue ray edition of the ninth gate has some nice additions. I found the audio commentary by Roman Polanski educational. He warms up to the movie after some time; after all, the commentary was done a year after the movie was released. Polanski is inspired to speak more than just about the MO, into what scenes he personally liked the most, and uncovers some of his artistic process.This is a movie that is worth paying attention to. There are many details that I found rewarding to find. The ninth gate has some stirring moments such as the curious energy that is within a womans green eyes, that appear un-human. The pages of the book, make you believe that they take life. You see similarities in the faces of the characters you meet with those within the unholy book. And the sometimes horrific scenes illustrated in the book, seem attached to what happens to our detective. A translation from latin, gives warning to danger from above; and then the unpredictable accident occurs from above. A scafolding falls apart to the danger of anyone below. Another eerie illustration gives chase to an immediate scene that faceplants you directly into the page of the book itself.The ninth gate is a movie that prepares you and intices you, like when you were a child listening to red robinhood. Except this movie is for the adult in you now. It is a story with anticipation, mystery, and unnamed danger lurking around every corner. It borrows iconic moments that we all know and love. A great movie that I highly recommend, but it is a movie that requires some faith on your behalf.

For all the eccentricity, though--and there's plenty of it--this actually isn't too tough to figure out.Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso, a lowlife rare book collector who, like everyone else in the film, wants what he wants when he wants it.  He is a dry, ironic, cynical intellectual whose dominant personality trait is his ego and desire for money.  Depp's performance is amazing despite how little he is given to work with; the laughs never stop as his curt, smartass responses to every question asked flow like a bilious current.Contracted by a power hungry devotee of the Black Arts (Frank Langella in one of his ugliest and most frightening roles) Boris Balkan, his mission is to find an authentic copy of a book called ""The Ninth Gate"", a text  which supposedly leads directly to the presence and power of Satan himself.Here the mad surreality and black humor begin.  It resembles very closely Roman Polanski's 1976 film ""The Tenant"", except this film has an almost complete absence of protagonists or decent characters at all.  Everyone is more less a degenerate. During Corso's ominous escapades and his encounters with thoroughly sinister and foul people (all of whom die when Balkan discovers that they are not cooperating with Corso's search, leading one to believe he is indeed the Devil), a young woman who looks like a raggedy college student follows him constantly.  At first she appears merely scary and irritating, like everyone else in this doomed, musty landscape: when Corso is physically attacked, however, we realize she is not an agent of Balkan's or a college student.  She displays supernatural powers and yet she reacts to the constant deaths that occur with a kind of attentiveness towards Corso's reactions, looking for guilt or disgust and finding none--and she seems pleased.The ending of the movie is so funny and so filthy at the same time that we know Polanski is refusing to compromise one little bit.  Corso, at first a neutral amoral character, becomes obsessed with his quest for the book and gets in Balkan's way--his ending is particularly hilarious.  Polanski also takes a shot at Satanists, as Balkan exclaims to a crowd of them, dressed in pentagrams and black robes: ""Do you really think the Prince of Darkness would manifest himself in the midst of this nonsense?""A good look at Corso's ""Guardian Angel"" at the end reveals just who she is and what her true intentions were the whole time.  I'm not going to reveal what happens, but I am surprised so many viewers were ""dumbfounded"" by this movie.

A book dealer is asked to inspect a rare book to verify its authenticity for its owner. The wealthy book collector, Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) shows Corso his book collection focused on the devil and his prize book is The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, printed in Venice in 1666.Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) tells the owner that two other copies exist but only one is the original version. The original book was supposedly written by Satan and it contains nine engravings that will summon Satan himself. Corso accepts the job but he should not be trusted. He will lie and cheat to buy rare books at a fraction of their real value. Corso travels to Europe to speak to the other owners and look at their books and try to purchase them and at least get to look at them.Corso is authorized to buy the real book at any and all costs, even if illegal. Balkan gives Corso a large check to finance his trip and time. Corso's trip proves both to be enlightening and suspenseful. He is seduced, attacked and his friend is murdered in a ritualistic way as depicted in the book.This is a creepy and suspenseful story. Not each book is identical and perhaps it takes all three to summon Satan. Corso's mission is the basis for the movie and it presents a very good storyline. The acting in the film is outstanding. This really is not a horror film but more of a film about the occult and the beliefs in the devil.

At worst, he's purported to be the father of lies, and one of the fallen angels. This means that anything he tells you is suspect, anything he gives you is suspect, and he probably has the power to make you believe in him. Yikes. Not a safe trip. Not a terribly sane trip, for that matter.Yet that is precisely what Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) desired. He had one copy of ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadow"", and there were three extant. One or all of these books is a forgery, and one or all holds the secret to summoning Satan. He hires Corso (played a bit too understated by Johnny Depp) to research the other texts.The movie is based on the novel ""The Club Dumas"" by Arturo Perez Reverte, which I favorably reviewed.I can't give a similar review to The Ninth Gate for a number of reasons. First, Depp's portrayal of Corso was one dimensional, and Corso was a multi-dimensional character. Whether that's the filmmaker's fault or Depp's I don't know, but Depp's Corso was a dreadful bore.A mysterious girl appeared and became an ally of his, demonstrating supernatural abilities. We are never given ample evidence as to why she might have had an interest in helping Corso, or in what her abilities might have been (never mind her identity). Yet since this is a character from the book, I know why she was there, I have a pretty good idea who she was (and good job to the author on how he handled that!) and her character's interests and abilities could have been better communicated, with very little difficulty.Also, in a rather silly departure from the book (departures are fine...I'm not being a book snob), they substitute an average sized platinum-blonde haired black male for a character in the book who was tall, white, and physically imposing. There's nothing that irritates me more than a ""quota substitute"". I don't think this particular sub had any speaking lines, which makes it that much more of an insult.I love intelligent thrillers. (I didn't care for The Da Vinci Code.) This was a thriller that spent time in libraries, that examined woodcuttings drawn, perhaps, by Lucifer himself - yet I wasn't engaged.In 1999, when the film was released, I couldn't sit through it. After reading The Club Dumas and then discovering that there was a connection between the two, I approached the film again, hoping that understanding where the book was coming from would help. It did not. In fact, it raised more questions.I would give this movie 2.5 stars and round it up to 3; however, I'm reviewing the DVD and the DVD gets a big spanking for not having subtitles.

482605,A1BOJUNFMBWWV5,6305897786,"Jordan Beard ""jjbeard926""","[8, 12]","First off, you don't have to be a fan of Johnny Depp to like this film. However, you should be at least interested in historical mysteries, modern religious explorations or the occult. It will make the movie much more entertaining for you if you like those types of films. That may sound off-putting, but keep in mind that such films as the Indiana Jones series, The Da Vinci Code (best selling novel, movie isn't out yet) and National Treasure all fall into these categories.Having said that, wow, what a great attempt this movie was. I'll explain why I say attempt in a moment. The acting is very good; the story is engaging and entertaining. I looked around the room while watching this movie with some friends and everyone was literally on the edge of their seats even though this really isn't an action film. Through mystery, suspense and intrigue the director is able to draw audiences into the world he has woven. Some of the clues followed and locations visited by the main character (Depp) are real and so for armchair historians there is an added feel of realism and interest. The ideas for this movie are excellent.Now we get to where this is a great attempt but it falls short of being a truly great movie. Until about three fourths of the way through the film everything is going great, acting, directing, special effects, everything is good. Then it almost feels as if they ran out of funds. Special effects are the first to go which is excusable except that they had been so good earlier in the movie you expect it to continue. Then the last five minutes or so of the film is a huge let down. The acting goes to hell next (excuse the pun) with Depp being the only one that remains in character for the whole film, most of his support falls apart. The story takes a turn that I can only assume was meant to be a plot twist, but instead it broke the plot in half and it died.Directing for the last few minutes of the film definitely broke down as well.

Johnny Depp, in a very interesting role, plays Dean Corso, who is essentially a book detective that freelances in appraising and finding rare works.

But what happens on his journey may not be worth the money after all.Not since Rosemary's Baby has Polanski made a picture this eerie. Though not as committed, the film could have been aesthetically darker and more stylized from a visual standpoint. The movie also could have easily gone on without the addition of the mysterious 'Girl' character, who left questions and more to be interpreted by the audience.Frank Langella was probably the single most important ingredient to the overall success in the macabre ambience of the film.

While The Ninth Gate suffers from the typical book to movie problems, it is actually a good movie.  The book is, of course, much better since you get the full story and deeper insights into the characters.  The movie though manages to capture the main elements of the book.  After watching it, I was amazed how much of the book they managed to fit into the movie (in one form or another) even though most of the book was cut out.  &lt;to understand what I mean you have to both read it and watch it...&gt;Johnny Depp did an amazing job as Corso.  He fit exactly the image I had created as I read the book.  All of the nuances of his character came out in the movie - the rumpled, alchoholic, smoker who is both like a wolf and a rabbit...For all of you who have complained about this movie - I agree, the music didn't fit.  The music itself was not bad, but it was used incorrectly.  They tried to make The Ninth Gate a suspense/horror movie when it is anything but.  It is a mystery drama, and it was only the music that created any sort of suspense at all.  More mellow music would have been much better.  As for the ending, I loved it.  It was completely different that the book's ending, but it was still very good.  It provided closure to the movie without having to get into a lot of cheezy explainations.

The story is disturbing and provocative, and ought to set the viewer thinking about the nature of evil, and the thin line between obsession and madness. It's cross-genre, if this worries you, but I understand this has recently been dubbed ""high concept"" by the folks in NYC and Hollywood, so perhaps this movie was a bit before its time, kind of crest of the wave. Consummate actors, Depp and Frank Langella inhabit this nightmare as if they've always been there. Every time I watch The 9th Gate, I see another piece of the underlying mosaic.

The film clearly operates on a three act structure. As many of you readers already would have read chunks of the story, I won't repeat it here. The first act is really good but weak on some levels, glimpses are seen of a film director at his best with his creation. Some touches are brilliant and we can't wait to get more. This is where the thread starts unravelling a bit. The second act. The second act follows the first act the same way with excellent all round touches then going downhill. When the third act comes, With all that happens before the final minutes, this is a very good film which takes its time but when it was over. My first thought was &quot;Huh?&quot;Clearly Polanski put care and love into this as it was to be his comeback kid and maybe somewhere in his fascinating mind,he got lost in a maze somewhere but this was one of the biggest let downs I have had ever watching a movie. I immediately dismissed it as &quot;a piece of crock&quot; the ending just ruined it all. But i kept hearing two stories..one camp stating my views, and the other one proclaiming a film at its best.This intrigued me quite a bit, I certainly saw some magical touches with the music, the cinematography, sets and atmosphere which was very dominant and very classically executed shots but uh uh nope..bad movie.I thought to give it another chance and oh boy this one is quite a thinker or a puzzle,and dont get me wrong , I like smart movies but am still trying to get this one. I purchased the DVD for cheap and saw it again. Yup, same good stuff I saw before but the ending really made me think. I still havent come to a conclusion. I might be an idiot or a smarty for buying this one. But this film really has something going for it, Im very sure of it so you should give this one a chance, even if its a letdown, just be sure to put your thinking hat on and watch this one very very carefully.As for the DVD, this is one of the best video transfers I have ever seen, Artisan has done an excellent job. It has to be seen to be believed how the colors come out, no hints of grain or any scratches, the blacks are perfect and the hues are brilliant. Very little chroma key effects are seen in some scenes but these are few. The sound is your standard 5.1 dolby digital with an aggressive mix. no complaints there and the extras are neat..The commentary by Polanski is entertaining and oh for heaven sakes i wished he explained the end but no...the dude left it to us. maybe it makes movie watching more exciting he thought. :)give this one a go..see what you think but dont dismiss it too easily like nearly everyone else did.",3,eh?,1006819200,"11 27, 2001",2001,2833,"['saw', 'film', 'fellow', 'movie', 'afficionado', 'theaters', 'Having', 'never', 'before', 'seen', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'fim', 'not', 'even', 'rosemary', 'baby', 'so', 'crucify', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'chomp', 'one', 'film', 'clearly', 'three', 'act', 'structure', 'many', 'readers', 'already', 'would', 'have', 'read', 'chunks', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'here', 'first', 'act', 'really', 'good', 'weak', 'levels', 'glimpses', 'are', 'seen', 'film', 'director', 'best', 'creation', 'touches', 'are', 'brilliant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'more', 'where', 'thread', 'unravelling', 'bit', 'second', 'act', 'second', 'act', 'first', 'act', 'same', 'way', 'excellent', 'round', 'then', 'going', 'downhill', 'When', 'third', 'act', 'final', 'minutes', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'My', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'quot', 'Huh', 'quot', 'Clearly', 'Polanski', 'put', 'care', 'love', 'was', 'be', 'comeback', 'kid', 'maybe', 'somewhere', 'fascinating', 'mind', 'got', 'lost', 'maze', 'somewhere', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'let', 'downs', 'have', 'had', 'ever', 'watching', 'movie', 'immediately', 'dismissed', 'quot', 'piece', 'crock', 'quot', 'ending', 'just', 'ruined', 'i', 'kept', 'hearing', 'two', 'stories..one', 'camp', 'stating', 'views', 'other', 'one', 'proclaiming', 'film', 'best.This', 'intrigued', 'quite', 'bit', 'certainly', 'saw', 'magical', 'touches', 'music', 'cinematography', 'sets', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'very', 'dominant', 'very', 'classically', 'executed', 'shots', 'uh', 'uh', 'nope..bad', 'movie.I', 'thought', 'give', 'chance', 'oh', 'boy', 'one', 'quite', 'thinker', 'puzzle', 'dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'smart', 'movies', 'am', 'still', 'trying', 'get', 'one', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'cheap', 'saw', 'again', 'Yup', 'same', 'good', 'stuff', 'saw', 'ending', 'really', 'made', 'think', 'still', 'havent', 'come', 'conclusion', 'might', 'be', 'idiot', 'smarty', 'buying', 'one', 'film', 'really', 'something', 'going', 'Im', 'very', 'sure', 'should', 'give', 'one', 'chance', 'even', 'letdown', 'just', 'be', 'sure', 'put', 'thinking', 'hat', 'watch', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'carefully.As', 'DVD', 'one', 'best', 'video', 'transfers', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Artisan', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'how', 'colors', 'come', 'out', 'hints', 'grain', 'scratches', 'blacks', 'are', 'perfect', 'hues', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Very', 'little', 'chroma', 'key', 'effects', 'are', 'seen', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'sound', 'standard', '5.1', 'dolby', 'digital', 'aggressive', 'mix', 'complaints', 'there', 'extras', 'are', 'neat..The', 'commentary', 'Polanski', 'entertaining', 'oh', 'heaven', 'sakes', 'i', 'wished', 'explained', 'end', 'dude', 'left', 'maybe', 'movie', 'watching', 'more', 'exciting', 'thought', 'give', 'one', 'go..see', 'what', 'think', 'dont', 'dismiss', 'too', 'easily', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'else', 'did']",The Ninth Gate

Fogliani-Ahmed""","[1, 3]","Without being active into the World of Evil (I'll take God anytime, thank you) I was very gladly impressed by this movie. This is the story of a rare book specialist who becomes both entangled and fascinated in his search of the Devil. Johnny Depp stars as Dean Corso. He is subcontracted by publisher mogul Boris Balkan - played here by none other than terrorific Frank Langella. Balkan sends Corso off to Europe with an unusual task: to compare his own copy of &quot;The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows&quot; (a manuscript that has the particular quality of summoning the Devil) with the only two others in existence. And so the game begins.I never even considered Johnny Depp as a good actor, but I was obviously mistaken, to the point where he's much improved. From the very first scenes Depp shows us just how much in command of his acting he is - as much as any good actor can possibly be. Frank Langella is nothing short of genial in his role of the calculating magnate. Lena Olin plays the part of a consumate &quot;dishy&quot; - as Corso puts it -, rich widow who desperately wants to get her own hands on Corso's copy of the sacrosanct book, a copy that used to belong to her husband, who hanged himself not too long ago.So glad this is not a typical Hollywood movie. Johnny Depp aside, it is a Franco-Spanish production with local actors and sites, filmed totally in Europe. I loved the idea of the world of antique books as background for the story. Since I have a passion for book collecting, it was mother's milk to me. Just for that, the film will appeal to collectors worldwide. The leather bindings, the paper, the fantastic engravings... it makes one's mouth water. Moreover, there is superb acting from Depp and Langella; but every single role is extremely well personified, so kudos in numbers go to the casting director. The erotic scene of the castle in flames has to be one of the most impressive ones I've seen in cinema lately, and it will stay in your mind for a while, not because of what is shown but because of what is not.

Both have very moody depictions of a dangerous Europe, and are very effective beyond their plot and screenplay.  Frantic is better - tense and intricate - but the Ninth Gate is still pretty great.  It's not a horror movie - very much closer to Indiana Jones or The DaVinci Code.  Sumptuous and shady.  But it does suffer from two major faults.  First is Polanski's characteristic black humor.  From some rather goofy characters to some jarringly silly moments, like when Langella murders Olin and then spooks the congregation, it's Polanski's peculiar touch but here really undermines what could have been a tense dark movie.  The second major problem is just the overblown ending - secret societies in costumes, rituals to conjure Satan - it all tops a serious and sinister thriller with overblown hokum.

482622,A356TJCTCLDN89,6305897786,Kimberley Wilson,"[7, 10]","I enjoyed Ninth Gate not because it's a great movie --and it certainly is not, but because it's incredibly funny. Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso a seedy book dealer who will do whatever needs doing to get his book for his well heeled clients. He's not a nice man and he's more cunning than smart. His client Mr. Balkan, played by the always fascinating Frank Langella has a book that was supposedly co-written by Lucifer himself and he needs to know if it's authentic. Corso of course, does not believe in such things and is only intersted in his fee.The former owner of the Ninth Gate book wants it back and everyone who has another copy of the book or who Corso talks to about the book ends up dead in horrible ways but Corso is too dumb or too greedy to really be frightened. That's a flaw in the script but it's also unintentionally funny. Any sane person would've realized that this is no ordinary antique book deal and would've quit after the first death. Corso makes a weak complaint to his client and just plods along.The expressions on Depp's face when he finds the bodies is a hoot. Other than those fleeting moments he has no other normal reaction to all the death and menace. It's like he's mildly sedated for the entire movie.Another amusing thing is the lack of understanding about rare books that the movie displays. In real life an antique book expert would not chain smoke over a 300 year old book, nor would he place drinks next to it.When the blonde with the green eyes and huge eyebrows shows up he simply thinks she's been sent by Mr. Balkan to watch him and provide bodyguard service. It never once dawns on him that this girl's uncanny ability to be always be where he needs her and to make things happen might be something more than natural.The movie also features one of the silliest sex scenes ever filmed. Depp appeared to be doing an imitation of a man with a severe case of sudden diarrhea and the scene gets the biggest laugh of the movie.So what is really good about Ninth Gate? Frank Langella, the actress who played the elderly Barroness, the two (Or was it one?) old guys who play the Spanish booksellers and the scenery.What's not so good? The script and direction. Polanski lost his touch years ago and it shows. Still, as long as you don't expect genuine horror or suspense you can have a good time with Ninth Gate.

482632,A2T049UQONS0OY,6305897786,Larry VanDeSande,"[34, 42]","I saw Roman Polanski's ""The Ninth Gate"" -- a horror film often poorly compared to his earlier ""Rosemary's Baby"" -- on a Saturday night when it began at 10 p.m. It is a good flick for late night on a Saturday -- it's about an unscrupulous rare book dealer (Johnny Depp in an effective role) that makes a deal with a similarly unscrupulous collector (Mr. Overactor Frank Langella) to visit Europe and determine if Langella's first edition book is authentic.Only catch is it's a first edition of a book written in the 1500s that portends a visit by the devil from those who read it. Depp takes the case (and a big check with a promise of more to come) and goes on a European travelall to check out the other two books in existence.Strange things begin to happen, weird people start showing up (including a protective angel) and mayhem begins to break out. Depp's investigation leads to death, fire and some interesting discoveries about the books. Langella shows up for a final scene of devil worship where his overacting takes on a new dimension.This is an interesting and fun movie, for the most part. The mystery story is very involving and the European travelogue, through Spain and France, is very interesting. The film has many suspenseful moments and Depp is unusually good in his role.This is a poor man's ""Rosemary's Baby"", however, and it lacks both the fit and finish of Polanski's other venture into devil worship. Still, it is a pretty good late night horror effort, one you can return to a few times to figure out whether that protective angel is actually a member of the devil's brigade or not.",3,An effective mystery; less so as demonic thriller,1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,1606,"['saw', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'horror', 'film', 'often', 'poorly', 'compared', 'earlier', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Saturday', 'night', 'when', 'began', '10', 'p.m', 'good', 'flick', 'late', 'night', 'Saturday', 'unscrupulous', 'rare', 'book', 'dealer', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'effective', 'role', 'deal', 'similarly', 'unscrupulous', 'collector', 'Mr.', 'Overactor', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'visit', 'Europe', 'determine', 'Langella', 'first', 'edition', 'book', 'authentic.Only', 'catch', 'first', 'edition', 'book', 'written', '1500s', 'visit', 'devil', 'who', 'read', 'Depp', 'case', 'big', 'check', 'promise', 'more', 'come', 'European', 'travelall', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'two', 'books', 'existence.Strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'weird', 'people', 'start', 'showing', 'up', 'including', 'protective', 'angel', 'begins', 'break', 'out', 'Depp', 'investigation', 'death', 'fire', 'interesting', 'discoveries', 'books', 'Langella', 'up', 'final', 'scene', 'devil', 'worship', 'where', 'overacting', 'new', 'dimension.This', 'interesting', 'fun', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'mystery', 'story', 'very', 'involving', 'European', 'travelogue', 'Spain', 'France', 'very', 'interesting', 'film', 'many', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'Depp', 'unusually', 'good', 'role.This', 'poor', 'man', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'however', 'fit', 'finish', 'Polanski', 'other', 'venture', 'devil', 'worship', 'Still', 'pretty', 'good', 'late', 'night', 'horror', 'effort', 'one', 'can', 'return', 'few', 'times', 'figure', 'out', 'protective', 'angel', 'actually', 'member', 'devil', 'brigade', 'not']",The Ninth Gate

482634,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,6305897786,Lee Armstrong,"[0, 0]","I liked ""The Ninth Gate"" for its incredibly long credit sequence at the beginning of the film.  The music is dramatic as it sweeps through door after door after door, all of which look exactly the same.  After about the fourth door, it becomes silly and laughter sets in.  It's like listening to an old vinyl record that is skipping, but not getting up to move the needle.After this, the movie goes downhill a bit, but Roman Polanski puts on a good show.  Particularly interesting is the consummation sequence in which his real-life wife Emmanuelle Seigner plays the green-eyed girl & does the deed with Depp to a background of flames.  It's not many men who would want their wives to do that, but Polanski's viewpoint has always been unique.  He is a great filmmaker.  His Best Director Oscar for ""The Pianist,"" nominations for ""Chinatown"" & ""Tess"" plus his screenplay nomination for the legendary ""Rosemary's Baby"" prove the point.  Even if 9th Gate begins to get a bit muddled, he has more than fulfilled his promise since his first film ""Knife in Water"" got a Best Foreign Language Film nomination back in 1963.Johnny Depp is also usually very interesting to watch.  He scored a couple Best Actor nominations for very different roles from ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" in 2003 to ""Finding Neverland"" in 2004.  As book dealer Dean Corso, I found the character's moral ambiguity to make him unattractive.  You couldn't really cheer for him; but he was interesting as he worked his way through the maze of facts in this old book mystery.Frank Langella has had a long career from ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"" back in 1970 to ""Good Night & Good Luck"" in 2005.  As the rich book collector Boris Balkan, he was very cerebral, but lacked a certain evil pizzazz to really make you cheer as he bursts into flames.  It felt more like he was pathetically weird.  Maybe that was what Polanski wanted.Lena Olin is such an interesting actress to watch.  She makes you feel like at any moment she could do almost anything.  She would work again with Depp in ""Chocolat"" and had a sole Oscar nomination in the supporting category in 1989 for ""Enemies: A Love Story.""  The role of Liana Telfer maximizes her strengths.  She goes from making love to Depp to trying to kill him with a hair-trigger temper.  Tony Amoni as her bodyguard with the cropped blond hair makes a visual impression.British stage actress Barbara Jeffords who appeared in films sporadically from ""Hamlet"" in 1959 to ""Madame Bovary"" in 2000, makes a memorable appearance as Baroness Kessler, another book collector.  The last sequence with her wheelchair banging repetitively into the wall as Corso awakes to find the flat aflame is visually brilliant.  James Russo who played Sheriff Poole in one of my favorite films, ""Open Range,"" puts in a good appearance as Bernie the bookseller who doesn't last too long holding onto Corso's rare tome.""The Ninth Gate"" isn't the most dreadful film ever.  Polanski is far too good a director for that to occur.  But it bogs down in plot details that never really seem to fit together.  For instance, how did all the pictures in the books once the three editions came together actually enable Boris Balkan?  Or they didn't, which is why he burned up -- and if that's the case, then was the film really all about something that didn't exist?  Yet, we see the Green Eyed girl flitting about; so we must conclude that something was going on, but what?  Did Depp's Corso become like Mia Farrow in ""Rosemary's Baby""?  Who knows?  After a movie as long as this, it should have been clear.  Perhaps we should just go to ""Pirates 3"" and not worry about it.

First off, I wonder who is that girl (played by Polanski's significant other) suppose to portray and why is she helping Dean, played by Johnny Depp admirably, and not Boris Balkin, the person who hired him to search and enthenticate the Ninth Gate book. I think she suppose to be Satan itself, watching over him if not one of his agent (like a guardian angel's). It seems to be the case since Dean has broken some of the deadly sin's in his ruthless pride for himself only and his lack of care for others. Satan does the choosing but it was ab odd way of showing that in the movie, like why go thru the motions, like why can't she just tell him the missing pieces. And what's with Satan having sex with Dean near the end have anything to do with the Ninth Gate????  Was Dean suppose to give Satan's (multi gendered i persume) a demon child? If so, what does that have anything to do with this movie. This seem to fit another demonic type movie that i saw before but it doesn't fit here...sorry.  Beside, if her face expression during the sex scene is suppose to put fear into our eyes, it could of did a better job since that wasn't even the same person at any point of the face change. If it had, then it might of been more believable but i was left to think 'who is this person DEan is having sex with?'. Well i was let down and maybe some of you feel the same way. This is not a horror movie and it wasn't suppose to be one but was attended to be a pychological thriller and in that, it acheive it in a slow pace way that only Polanki could. There is no doubt that Polanski can direct movies with his wonderful camera angles at making the viewer feel like they are there as well. The ending was a disapointment because it doesn't make sense yet i enjoy the movie nevertheless.If you want to see Polanski's at his best, then read my review on 'Rosemary's Baby', which is one of the best horror movies ever made along with the Exocist, in my opinion.

This film reminds me they are a mystery to me. And about devil or Satan, i am far from knowing them so i don't know if i've ignored something in this movie. 2: How did Dean Corso's journey let him fall in...the hell(?)? i don't think it has been answered very well. If we want to let someone fall down the hell(a so deep and dark place) we have to let him do really bad things. Or don't let him do simple good things. I think we need more stronger evidence here. I guess the director tried to say someone never did things against the law and he could survive cleverly and no one(a good friend) reminded him to go back anyway he left God and was attracted by the world of evil gradually, day by day and suddenly, it is too late to do anything to go back. I think this movie needs more key details to describe this process. And this man should be obvious cleverer than all other people he's met. Yes Dean Corso is clever in this film but maybe he can be cleverer in some aspects. He must be able to tell good and evil. But because nothing can remind him to admire the good feeling when he closes good things so he always ""forgets"" them. The time your conscience should be awoken but it hasn't and the time you shouldn't be tempted but you have . 1: This movie has done some good work. Sometimes it looks like some of my dreams...not really looks like them but the atmosphere. I think it means it has touched our subconscious, they desire beautiful things no matter they exist in a good or evil world. Pure evil doesn't know what good is so it hurts you and takes things from you not for hating you but for it's nature. That's what the woman called ""green eyes"" has done to Dean.

If you are looking for such a thing, you will not find much better that ""The Ninth Gate"".To begin, one precision - this is the adaptation of a great novel, ""Club Dumas"" by the Spanish author Arturo Perez Reverte. The book is amazing but very, very hard to adapt to the screen - so Polanski had to make many changes. As the result, you can now watch a great movie and read a great book, in whatever order you like, without being disappointed by one of them.This movie is about ancient books, people who collect them and people who live by trading them - and it is an amazing thing how passionate this world is. It is a great achievement of Polanski that he managed to keep a very honest pace of events, when placing the action mostly in librairies, bookshops etc. The gallery of persons shown in this movie is, typically for Polanski, made of characters mostly excentrical, frequently upsetting, sometimes very funny, but never, not even once, boring.This is in large part one Johnny Depp show, and this is a great show. His character (Dean Corso, trader in ancient books) is in this movie slightly less antipatic than in the novel, but clearly he is not a totally nice guy. The way Johnny Depp acts in this movie confirms the impression I had for many years now - he is not only handsome, he is simply one of the greatest actors alive (and doesn't even need dreadlocks and gold teeth to prove it).Emmanuelle Seigner plays a character that is totally ambigous (she is just The Girl - we never know what is her name) and I will not reveal anything more about her. She is beautiful, mysterious, tempting but distant and she certainly is leading the main hero somewhere. But we do not know where - until the last image. Lena Olin (Liana Telfer) and Frank Langella (Boris Balkan) are other stars of the show - they are supporting characters and appear less on the screen, but they are both very important.However the real ""hero"" of this movie could only be... a book. This book is called - what else - ""The Nine Gates"" and was written by a heretic alchimist around year 1515. The Inquisition then burned the author with all the copies which was possible to find - and the further we advance in the movie, the most we realise, that for once, for this one time, the Inquisition could very well have done the right thing! You desserve to discover the rest of the story by yourself.This is an amazing movie. Reading some of the previews below I couldn't understand how you can be bored by it? Thanks to Polanski's unique touch there is more atmosphere in every scene of ""Ninth Gate"" that we actually can take in. There is a pair of extremely handsome and talented actors. There is the discreet but beautiful musical score by Wojciech Kilar. There is a deep and very very dangerous mystery. There is an almost sadistic, totally unsuspected twist towards the end. And there is finally, well hidden in the shadows, one writer, who really doesn't need an agent to take care of his bookwriting career.... See this film!

482648,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,6305897786,Marc Cabir Davis,"[6, 10]","Roman Polanski's latest outing as director of the macabre is both amusing and disturbing, though never impressive. 'The Ninth Gate' was expected to be the director's comeback bid after the brilliant 'Death and the Maiden',  and the top-notch star cast (save for Polanski's incredibly untalented  wife) promised much. But what remains at the end of it is a confused,  directionless film with no soul.Johny Depp, who has been seen in better  films such as 'Ed Wood', plays a heartless book dealer, who specializes in  locating and trading valuable and rare books. The role seems interesting  enough at the start of the film, and Depp's emotionless performance is  intriguing, but after a while it just gets to be plain boring. He is hired  by a mysterious satan-obsessed collector who wants him to trace two books  that are supposedly written by Satan himself . If this isn't unbelievable  enough, it gets even worse when Depp jumps at the idea (he does it for the  money, people) and takes off for exotic foreign shores such as Lisbon and  the French Riviera in search of the elusive works of the Devil. He also  seems to have a Guardian Angel of sorts - a blonde puffy woman who follows  him around everywhere. This role is played by Emanuelle Seigner, Polanski's  real life wife, and its difficult to imagine a role more nonsensical. Its  bad enough that Seigner is a depressingly poor actress, but to watch her  drift in and out of the frames with no particular purpose, is quite enough.  She fared far better in 'Bitter Moon' where she was cast aside Hugh Grant  and Kristin Scott Thomas. She held her own in that film, but falters hugely  in this one.Depp's mission is this : armed with one of the books written  by the Devil, he is to trace the other two and compare the contents, to  decide which of the three is the original. This task seems hard to  accomplish, as there are far too many people dying and too many weird  incidents going on for Depp to feel comfortable. He is also followed around  by Seigner and a dark-skinned motorbike-rider who seems to want him dead.  Depp is repeatedly saved by Seigner, who reveals herself as non-human in  one scene where she flies down the staircase rather than walk it (rather  useful, don't you think?). The duo finally discover the secret behind this  whole sorry tale, and the viewer is left wishing that they hadn't. This is  not much of a story to begin with, but as the tale draws to a close, you  begin to wonder if this really is a Polanski production. Everything is  dismal, the lighting is bad, and the performances are third rate. Depp  almost sleepwalks through the entire movie, even during the sex scenes  (pity that they're as short as they are). Seigner, who has grown as an  actress (and I mean this strictly in the physical sense of the term - she  seems to have packed on at least 20 pounds since her last film) is  eminently forgettable in her role as Angel, despite the secrets that are  revealed about her toward the end of the movie (though you probably guessed  it all along). The only time she looks remotely inspired is while shes  riding Depp as they have sex outdoors. Its also the time Depp expresses any  emotion, but its far too late for any of us to begin caring.One wonders  what the message of 'The Ninth Gate' is, and what the purpose behind making  such a film is. The problem with this film is that it starts off looking  terribly good - the opening sequences are very interesting - but half way  down the line, you realize that it lacks any kind of direction. And despite  Depp's dark, brooding role as a man with no conscience, his potrayal of the  character is so ill-acted that its a shame. He could have done better, and  one would say the same of Polanski.Ultimately, the problem with 'The  Ninth Gate ' is that it doesn't know what its about. If you want to know  how a film shouldn't be made, then, by all means, rent this title (but for  heaven's sake, don't buy it!). Personally, I haven't seen a film this  confusing and disappointing, in years.

482651,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,6305897786,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[16, 34]","There are a lot of reasons why I went to see The Ninth Gate. Perhaps top on the list is because the director, Roman Polanski, is the man responsible for the highly disturbing, yet artistically sound Rosemary's Baby. But it's also because of the movie's subject matter, i.e. Beelzebub, the Lord of the Flies, Lucifer, and Mr. Boogedyman...whatever you choose to call him. Satan.You can take a look at the past, oh, twenty-five years, and it's amazing how Satan's popularity fluctuates in pop culture. With movies like Dracula, Rosemary's Baby, Prophecy I & II, and End of Days forming the backdrop of our modern experience, it seems like today's society finds the subject fascinating, if not &quot;cool.&quot; Satan movies are all the rage. So I went to The Ninth Gate to see if the subject matter gets the same distressing treatment found in End of Days-to see if Polanski didn't sacrifice plausibility for pizzazz.He did.The flick follows book dealer/con artist Dean Corso as he attempts to verify the authenticity of a book for book collector/Satan-lover Boris Balkan (who is also filthy rich). The book is called The Ninth Gate, and it was supposedly written by the devil, who even drew the cute little pictures found in the pages. The theory is that if you get all the pictures together and speak some rudimentary Latin, the Dark Angel himself will pop up and shoot the breeze with you for a while. In a twist of what I suppose is irony, the motto of the book found on the title page reads: &quot;Thus let the light shine.&quot; That nutty Satan! He's all into irony.What is redeeming about this film? Two things. The tone, for one, is good. Polanski didn't rush himself, and so he reproduces the same eerily hushed quality found in Rosemary's Baby. Johnny Depp, playing Corso, delivers a well-measured performance in sync with the movie's atmosphere. Unfortunately the tone of the movie demands substance. This film has none. It relies so much on the weight of its subject matter that the audience members are left essentially clueless on some basic plot points.A lot of reviewers are going to harp on the &quot;artistic integrity&quot; of this film, and to its credit, the cinematography and editing are excellent. But good timing and restraint are not workable substitutes for a decent story. Depp's character starts the movie with the type of noncommittal attitude necessary for the plot, but by the end, his indifference is reflected by the audience. Polanski mistook confusion for art. When there's not a strong story to guide the mood, even the best craftsmanship becomes meandering nonsense (see Eyes Wide Shut).However, even with the mish-mash of supernatural gumbo, even with the unfortunate and undecipherable ending, and even with the cartoonish side characters more fitting for a Sandman comic book, the movie at least doesn' t TOTALLY glorify Satanism. I'm all for dissing the devil's fan club. Most worshippers of the devil, it seems to say, are self-indulgent whiners who just need an excuse to hold orgies. What a burn.But that's one brief, fleeting moment in the film. It's an instance of inflated self-awareness that loses steam fast. Polanski gets his jabs in on the devil's followers, but the conclusion of the film makes him seem sympathetic toward the devil himself. As if his acceptance of Satan wasn't enough to distance the movie from the typical non-evil-promoting viewer, that very acceptance is so clouded in distraction and &quot;artistic integrity&quot; that the only thing getting burned when the credits roll is the audience.",1,What A Burn,1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,3562,"['are', 'lot', 'reasons', 'why', 'went', 'see', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'Perhaps', 'top', 'list', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'man', 'responsible', 'highly', 'disturbing', 'yet', 'artistically', 'sound', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'also', 'movie', 'subject', 'matter', 'i.e', 'Beelzebub', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'Lucifer', 'Mr.', 'Boogedyman', 'choose', 'call', 'Satan.You', 'can', 'take', 'look', 'past', 'oh', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'amazing', 'how', 'Satan', 'popularity', 'pop', 'culture', 'movies', 'Dracula', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Prophecy', 'II', 'End', 'Days', 'forming', 'backdrop', 'modern', 'experience', 'today', 'society', 'subject', 'fascinating', 'not', 'quot', 'cool.', 'quot', 'Satan', 'movies', 'are', 'rage', 'went', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'see', 'subject', 'matter', 'same', 'distressing', 'treatment', 'found', 'End', 'Days-to', 'see', 'Polanski', 'did', ""n't"", 'sacrifice', 'plausibility', 'pizzazz.He', 'did.The', 'flick', 'book', 'dealer/con', 'artist', 'Dean', 'Corso', 'verify', 'authenticity', 'book', 'book', 'collector/Satan-lover', 'Boris', 'Balkan', 'who', 'also', 'filthy', 'rich', 'book', 'called', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'was', 'supposedly', 'written', 'devil', 'who', 'even', 'drew', 'cute', 'little', 'pictures', 'found', 'pages', 'theory', 'get', 'pictures', 'together', 'speak', 'rudimentary', 'Latin', 'Dark', 'Angel', 'will', 'pop', 'up', 'shoot', 'breeze', 'while', 'twist', 'what', 'suppose', 'irony', 'motto', 'book', 'found', 'title', 'page', 'reads', 'quot', 'Thus', 'let', 'light', 'shine.', 'quot', 'nutty', 'Satan', 'irony.What', 'redeeming', 'film', 'Two', 'things', 'tone', 'one', 'good', 'Polanski', 'did', ""n't"", 'rush', 'so', 'same', 'eerily', 'hushed', 'quality', 'found', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'playing', 'Corso', 'well-measured', 'performance', 'sync', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'Unfortunately', 'tone', 'movie', 'substance', 'film', 'none', 'so', 'much', 'weight', 'subject', 'matter', 'audience', 'members', 'are', 'left', 'essentially', 'clueless', 'basic', 'plot', 'points.A', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'are', 'going', 'harp', 'quot', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'quot', 'film', 'credit', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'are', 'excellent', 'good', 'timing', 'restraint', 'are', 'not', 'workable', 'substitutes', 'decent', 'story', 'Depp', 'character', 'movie', 'type', 'noncommittal', 'attitude', 'necessary', 'plot', 'end', 'indifference', 'reflected', 'audience', 'Polanski', 'mistook', 'confusion', 'art', 'When', 'not', 'strong', 'story', 'guide', 'mood', 'even', 'best', 'craftsmanship', 'meandering', 'nonsense', 'see', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', '.However', 'even', 'mish-mash', 'supernatural', 'gumbo', 'even', 'unfortunate', 'undecipherable', 'ending', 'even', 'cartoonish', 'side', 'characters', 'more', 'fitting', 'Sandman', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'least', 'doesn', 't', 'TOTALLY', 'glorify', 'Satanism', ""'m"", 'dissing', 'devil', 'fan', 'club', 'Most', 'worshippers', 'devil', 'say', 'are', 'self-indulgent', 'whiners', 'who', 'just', 'need', 'excuse', 'hold', 'orgies', 'What', 'burn.But', 'one', 'brief', 'fleeting', 'moment', 'film', 'instance', 'inflated', 'self-awareness', 'steam', 'fast', 'Polanski', 'jabs', 'devil', 'followers', 'conclusion', 'film', 'seem', 'sympathetic', 'devil', 'acceptance', 'Satan', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'distance', 'movie', 'typical', 'non-evil-promoting', 'viewer', 'very', 'acceptance', 'so', 'clouded', 'distraction', 'quot', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'quot', 'only', 'thing', 'getting', 'burned', 'when', 'credits', 'roll', 'audience']",The Ninth Gate

The acting is good, Depp made a good sleazeball, toeing the line between respectability and going over the deep end.  The  most over the wall character acting is the actor playing Balkan, the man  who hires Depp, but as I found his cornballing funny, I didn't really mind  that he over played his part.The movie moves at a fairly decent pace,  though it does tend to drag a little now and then.  The unveiling of the  plot is handled well, giving you a little bigger piece here and there as  Depp begins to put together the information he is acquiring, and the way he  spots the differences in the books, and begins deciphering the clues.The  bad: Unfortunately, for all that we are told, there is still much we are  not told.  Though pieces of the plot are given to us, much is still  withheld, with holes big enough to drive a car through in the plot.  The  ending itself, without giving anything anyway, which isn't hard not to  since we ourselves are not told what's happening at the end, leaves us  hanging.  I don't know about anyone else, but when I plunk down good money  on a movie, I like to be told what's happening, not given just a vague  possibility about what might or might not have happened.

Since I'm an amateur reviewer I'm not required to see every film, read every book and since time is at a premium I try not to see bad films, read bad books, etc.  But I wasted more than two hours on this insultingly bad movie, and I wish I had my time back.I was watching one of the movie channels.  This film, which I previously knew nothing about, started.  The credits rolled.  Directed by Roman Polanski... good, good - the guy who directed ""Chinatown"".  There's Johnny Depp - great, I like Johnny Depp and all the women at my house aren't going to complain about watching a Johnny Depp movie.  There's Frank Langella - good, I liked him ever since his version of Dracula with Olivier.The movie started off okay, drawing me in with an intriguing story and these compelling actors.  Depp plays Dean Corso, a rare book dealer.  Langella plays Boris Balkan, a rich book collector who wants Corso to track down a rare satanic book. By thirty minutes into the movie I was hooked.Thirty minutes later I thought ""well, THIS is sure getting boring.""  Thirty minutes after that I thought ""this is really getting bad and stupid.""  Thirty minutes after THAT I thought ""this ending is really shaping up to be bad, but I've invested over an hour and a half in this movie and it is bad almost in a train-wreck kind of way.Then it got REALLY bad.  At the end I sat in the room feeling ""I've been HAD!  My time has been STOLEN from me.  I can't believe I sat and watched that.  I can't believe THOSE actors and THAT director could have made something so bad.I felt so burned I looked up other reviews.  Roger Ebert wrote that it ""opens with a spectacularly good title sequence and goes downhill from there--but slowly, so that all through the first hour there is reason for hope, and only gradually do we realize the movie isn't going to pay off.""  Berardinelli of Reelviews was less kind: ""The Ninth Gate has two modes: tedious and moronic, with the two not being mutually exclusive. Then, one-hundred minutes into this seemingly interminable movie (which clocks in at about 2:10), things take a turn for the worse and The Ninth Gate spirals out of control. A jaw-droppingly bad mixture of film noir and the occult, this picture plods and meanders its way through one uninspired scene after another until it reaches an improbable, laughable climax followed by an equally ridiculous denouement.

482658,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305897786,Matthew Horner,"[2, 6]","The Ninth Gate is an intriguing thriller that will put some viewers off because it is a throwback to a time when special effects were not king. There are virtually no F/X here and what few there are ones the movies could easily do thirty years ago. Personally, I enjoy seeing a good story and good acting, so I wasn't much bothered by this. I know that much of today's audience is conditioned to expect lots of graphics and thunderous noises. Knowing beforehand that they are mainly absent here may help some people to enjoy this occult story more.Dean Corso [Johnny Depp] deals in rare books. He's not an intellectual. He's a shrewd operator, and it's all about money. When we first meet him, he is dealing with the greedy children of an incapacitated old man. He does his appraisal, and along the way, he talks them into selling a first edition of Don Quixote for $4,100. He makes a killing on the deal. His next appointment is with Boris Balkan [Frank Langella], a billionaire collector of books. Balkan has purchased one of three existing copies of a book published in 1668. The author was accused of witchcraft and burned at the stake. Balkan alleges that only one of the three copies is authentic, and he offers Dean a fortune to go to Europe in order to examine the others. Dean has no spiritual beliefs. He believes in profit. He doesn't think much about the deal until he notices he is being followed. Next his apartment is ransacked. He gives the book to a friend for safe keeping. This has dire consequences, but Dean decides to go on to Europe anyway. The other half of his pay depends on his going through with the deal. He goes first to Spain and then to Paris. Along the way, everything becomes spooky, and the death toll mounts. Dean starts to believe.Depp, as usual, is great. Wearing eye glasses and sporting graying temples, he is totally believable in the part. Langella has only three scenes, but he makes the most of them. Barbara Jeffers is notable as a rich, hard-nosed book collector who sizes Dean up in about ten seconds.Roman Polanski has lived in France for many years and has returned to his European roots as a film maker. The Ninth Gate has a much slower pace than did his Hollywood classics, Rosemary's Baby and Chinatown. Europeans tend to take their time in telling a story. They like to color things in. I enjoy this from time to time, but the pace will prove to slow for some viewers. I also should tell you that the 'payoff' at the movie's climax is pretty tame and ambiguous by American standards.

482659,A1AMR2GU34OVJP,6305897786,Matthew Newland,"[26, 31]","I love &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;.  I have seen it many times since I first rented it back in the summer of 2000, and after buying it about a year or so later I have always made it a point to view it regularly.  Director Roman Polanski has given us another masterpiece of horror with some good touches of comedy, all wrapped up in a cloak of atmosphere so thick that you could cut it with a knife.  While I am not a die-hard fan of Polanski in the way I am with directors such as Tim Burton, I have seen and enjoyed very much three of his films: &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot;, &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot;, and &quot;Frantic&quot;, and have observed elements found in each of those three movies to be definitely present in this one.  &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; obviously has its maker's fingerprints all over it, which is good news for fans of his work.&quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; works great as a detective story, which is really what it is more a horror film.  Johnny Depp, my favorite actor hands down, takes us on a bizarrely fascinating journey through Portugal and France hoping to track down two of the three remaining copies of a book apparantly written by Satan himself during the Middle Ages.  Along the way, we watch him being followed and see some suspicious setbacks occur, along with his dealings with his employer, a millionaire Satanist by the name of Boris Balkan.The good things I have to say about this film: first, the directing is fantastic, atmospheric and spellbinding.  You will be totally immersed in the goings-on of this film, in spite of its numerous quiet and thoughtful moments and overall slow-moving nature.  The European location work is gorgeous ... we see some beautiful and sinister cities, castles, and countrysides.  The movie looks and feels great.  Also, a bizarre and interesting choice was made to cast the same man as four different characters, who(m) we meet two at a time, first and then again later, in the same location.  Was this supposed to be symbolic or indicate something implicitly to the audience?Second, the musical score by a fellow named Wojciech Kilar is beautiful; its haunting, subtle, and quiet.  It perfectly accents the scenes it plays behind, in no way upstaging the action or even drawing attention to itself.  Also, I loved the soloist (a Korean girl, I understand) who sang during the opening and ending credits.  I find it appalling that during the trailers advertising this film, they played some awful new-metal-crud in an effort to get all the MTV kids into the theater.  As awful as this was, I am very thankful that none of this music found its way into the movie itself ... it would be entirely inappropriate.  Kilar's compositions are spot-on perfect, and nothing else should have been used.Third, I was really taken by the fascinating artwork done for the engravings.  They were almost tarot-cardish, and very bizarre.  I particularly liked the one of the guy hanging by his foot from a noose (and the way it figured into a later scene after we see it for the first time) and the image of the maze with the castle turrets.  The moment when we see the initials &quot;LCF&quot; in tiny letters hidden on particular ones was absolutely chilling.Fourthly and finally, in spite of the fact that Johnny Depp is my favorite actor, I must say that it was Frank Langella as Boris Balkan who stole this movie away.  Balkan is a fascinating character, from his special library (did anyone notice the passcode he entered to unlock its door?) to his attitude toward phony Satanists (his little &quot;Boo!&quot; moment was classic), all the way to his unfortunate end.  His dedication to his beliefs could be both inspiring and frightening (check out what he says to Corso, Depp's character, when he tells him that the book has been stolen from his hotel room), and I enjoyed every moment that had him on the screen.  Langella's Balkan definitely comes away as this movie's most memorable character.  I am now very interested in seeing the version of &quot;Dracula&quot; he did back in the 1970s.One final thing: I found interesting the director's choice to present Satanism in a more objective light than would normally done in films such as these.  I understand that Polanski really has no religious beliefs, so as far as he's concerned one is as good as another.  While I do not agree with this, it certainly makes for an interesting and original approach to the subject matter, and really works for this movie's benefit.Give &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; a try today.

482660,A3PR4ZSBDUL4EG,6305897786,"Matthew S. Schweitzer ""zohoe""","[5, 7]","Roman Pulanski's Ninth Gate is an enjoyable psychological occult thriller that follows in the footsteps of other great films like Rosemary's Baby and Angel Heart.  This is no blood and gore slasher flick.  The film follows the dark quest of rare book detective Dean Corso, played wonderfully here by a mousey and rumpled Johnny Depp in one of his most enjoyable roles.  Corso has been hired by wealthy publisher and self-styled demonologist Boris Balkan, played by a genuinely creepy Frank Langella, to authenticate his newly aquired copy of &quot;The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows&quot;, a 17th century Satanic tome reputed to possess the ability to conjure the Devil himself.  The most enjoyable aspect of the story is how Corso's character changes over the course of his journey to the darkside.  He begins as a shady, self-centered mercenary, interested only in his share of the profit.  He himself seems to be a disgruntled bibliophile who now buys and sells rare volumes without care or affection for the people he works with or the books he swindles from unsuspecting collectors.  By the end of the film, however, Corso has himself become won over with the burning desire which consumes his employer Balkan in his drive to possess the very powers of Hell. A beautiful Lena Olin plays the equally obssessed former owner of the book who desperately wants to re-aquire it from Corso and will stop at nothing to do so.  What results is at times a slow but darkly entertaining tale of brooding mystery as Corso finally discovers the true power of the book and the secrets it contains.There is a truly creepy feel throughout this film that compliments the subject matter quite well.  It does not rely on cheap quick scares or bloody axe murders which has become the bane of lesser films in recent history.  While I enjoy a good scare and plenty of good old fashioned gore, at times it is refreshing to find a movie that is intelligent enough to weave a good story and leave you wanting more.  The film leaves many questions to ponder as we follow Corso's quest to authenticate the Nine Gates.  What role does the Green-Eyed Girl, played by Emmanuelle Seigner, really play here?  Is she Corso's protector or the agent of his doom?  Is she the devil incarnate come to ensure the success of her satanic chosen one?  And what role do the Ceniza brothers, the old twin bookbinders from Spain, have to play in this?  Are they simply what they seem, helpful and knowledgeable about the book and it's unfortunate author Aristide Torchia?  Or are they also more than they appear...agents of the Devil perhaps?  This theme of being more than appearances runs throughout Ninth Gate, reflecting the fact that the Devil frequently works through seemingly innocent means and that appearances are often deceiving.  It reenforces in us the notion that evil and darkness surround us and are always watching, and that Satan is always looking for a few good men.",5,Dark and Moody Tale of the Occult,1010102400,"01 4, 2002",2002,2951,"['Roman', 'Pulanski', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'enjoyable', 'psychological', 'occult', 'thriller', 'footsteps', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Angel', 'Heart', 'blood', 'gore', 'slasher', 'flick', 'film', 'dark', 'quest', 'rare', 'book', 'detective', 'Dean', 'Corso', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'here', 'mousey', 'rumpled', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'roles', 'Corso', 'been', 'hired', 'wealthy', 'publisher', 'self-styled', 'demonologist', 'Boris', 'Balkan', 'played', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'authenticate', 'newly', 'aquired', 'copy', 'quot', 'Nine', 'Gates', 'Kingdom', 'Shadows', 'quot', '17th', 'century', 'Satanic', 'tome', 'reputed', 'possess', 'ability', 'conjure', 'Devil', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'aspect', 'story', 'how', 'Corso', 'character', 'changes', 'course', 'journey', 'darkside', 'shady', 'self-centered', 'mercenary', 'interested', 'only', 'share', 'profit', 'be', 'disgruntled', 'bibliophile', 'who', 'now', 'rare', 'volumes', 'care', 'affection', 'people', 'books', 'unsuspecting', 'collectors', 'end', 'film', 'however', 'Corso', 'become', 'won', 'burning', 'desire', 'employer', 'Balkan', 'drive', 'possess', 'very', 'powers', 'Hell', 'beautiful', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'equally', 'obssessed', 'former', 'owner', 'book', 'who', 'desperately', 're-aquire', 'Corso', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'do', 'so', 'What', 'results', 'times', 'slow', 'darkly', 'entertaining', 'tale', 'brooding', 'mystery', 'Corso', 'finally', 'true', 'power', 'book', 'secrets', 'truly', 'creepy', 'feel', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'quite', 'well', 'not', 'rely', 'cheap', 'quick', 'scares', 'bloody', 'axe', 'murders', 'become', 'bane', 'lesser', 'films', 'recent', 'history', 'enjoy', 'good', 'scare', 'plenty', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'gore', 'times', 'refreshing', 'find', 'movie', 'intelligent', 'enough', 'weave', 'good', 'story', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more', 'film', 'many', 'questions', 'ponder', 'follow', 'Corso', 'quest', 'authenticate', 'Nine', 'Gates', 'What', 'role', 'Green-Eyed', 'Girl', 'played', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner', 'really', 'play', 'here', 'Corso', 'protector', 'agent', 'doom', 'devil', 'incarnate', 'come', 'ensure', 'success', 'satanic', 'chosen', 'one', 'what', 'role', 'do', 'Ceniza', 'brothers', 'old', 'twin', 'bookbinders', 'Spain', 'have', 'play', 'Are', 'simply', 'what', 'seem', 'helpful', 'knowledgeable', 'book', 'unfortunate', 'author', 'Aristide', 'Torchia', 'are', 'also', 'more', 'appear', 'agents', 'Devil', 'perhaps', 'theme', 'being', 'more', 'appearances', 'runs', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'reflecting', 'fact', 'Devil', 'frequently', 'seemingly', 'innocent', 'means', 'appearances', 'are', 'often', 'deceiving', 'notion', 'evil', 'darkness', 'surround', 'are', 'always', 'watching', 'Satan', 'always', 'looking', 'few', 'good', 'men']",The Ninth Gate

It's hard to believe this wickedly restrained Johnny Depp is the same one who floated through PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN.  Depp is an actor with a wide range and an intense desire to play roles one wouldn't originally see him in.  It's hard to tell in the beginning if Depp is a true hero, or is he just as bad as the notorious Frank Langella or the daffy Lena Olin.  Add Emmannuelle Sangier (spelling?) as a guardian angel named Green Eyes and one never really knows what's going on.  Unfortunately, the film is so cerebral it never manages to build any true sense of suspense or terror.  Polanski directs vividly, but with little regard for the emotional input of his characters.  The real star of the movie is the deliciously malevolent musical score.  At times mellow and melancholy, and then buoyant and teasing, it is a true musical score, that adds much to the cinematic goings on.

I think he really has a keener eye these days.Johnny Depp gives his usual dark intensive performance.  If he smokes as much in real life as in this movie, he should be dead from lung cancer within five years.  There is something extremely sexy about this character.  His character is believable as one could be as a book collector/dealer, that does not mind having very little scruples.Who here would not suspect Frank Langella as an avid book collector ""only wanting Depp's character to compare pictures from three volumes of the same satanic book""?I enjoyed the comparisons in the mysteries of the three books, as well as finding the ""girl"" intriguing.  I also admit that the deaths of three collectors of the same devilish book, to be extremely comical.  The look on the face of the strangled wheelchair bound collector brought some humor to a very dark suspensful story.I enjoyed every moment of this movie, mostly because I like movies that delve into the dark closets of the mind.  I did find that the ending left me thinking I had missed something.  So I watched it again, and nope, I didn't miss a thing.

482677,A3CCQKKTL7M189,6305897786,MIKE PHILLIPS,"[1, 2]","Johhny Depp, who has always been known for choosing strange &amp; challenging roles, did something strange in 1999,2000. Over the course of a 12 month period, he starred in 3 films. Usually just the opposite is true.  The Astronauts Wife was totally forgettable, while Sleepy Hollow was  wonderful. The Ninth Gate falls somewhere in the middle. Trying to get back  his glory days of Rosemary's Baby, director Roman Polanski chose another  interesting, supernatural vehicle. I just felt that it lacked a lot of  things that kept it from being as brillant. One of these things,  regretably, was Depp's performance. Only a bit more animated than his  performance in the Astronaut's Wife, Depp sometimes seemed to be sleeping  through this role. He was much more effective in another of his &quot;every  guy&quot; role in the movie Nick of Time. Though the truth is,with this  film, he didn't have a heck of a lot more to work with. Polanski couldn't  seem to make up his mind whether the characters in this movie were supposed  to be cartoony or dramatic. He got an odd mix of the 2. Just listen to  lines like Depp's after he and the dead book owners wife have just finished  mking love ( i can't repeat them here)...but he delivers the line smirking  into the camera like something out of a campy spy movie. There's also the  annoying bit of Polanski not introducing the when &amp; where of any of his  scenes. Depp goes from NY to Portugal to Spain, and Polanski leaves the  viewer wondering just where the character is now, and sometimes how he got  there. Sometimes it feels like the viewer came in in the middle of the  picture, when they have been watching it from the start. However, the film  does hold the viewer's attention ( unlike the somewhat similar, apocolyptic  snoozer End of Days), despite its almost 2 &amp; 1/2 hour length. And some  of the performances are genuinely eerie, like that of Frank Langellas (  just listen to that voice on the phone!).But going for the anti-climactic,  artistic ending was a wrong move. It left me, oddly enough,feeling like I  was taken ( much like Corso's clientele in the movie). The picture was shot  nicely enough &amp; had some terrific music ( that included a bit that  almost sounded like the Jaws theme). I think that Polanski could have given  in and given the viewers a little bit more of a spectacular, Hollywood  ending ( and beleive me, I don't say that often!).",3,"Not Polanski's best, nor Depp's",964137600,"07 21, 2000",2000,2424,"['Johhny', 'Depp', 'who', 'always', 'been', 'known', 'choosing', 'strange', 'amp', 'challenging', 'roles', 'did', 'something', 'strange', '1999,2000', 'course', '12', 'month', 'period', 'starred', '3', 'films', 'Usually', 'just', 'opposite', 'true', 'Astronauts', 'Wife', 'was', 'totally', 'forgettable', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'was', 'wonderful', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'falls', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'Trying', 'get', 'back', 'glory', 'days', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'chose', 'interesting', 'supernatural', 'vehicle', 'just', 'felt', 'lacked', 'lot', 'things', 'kept', 'being', 'brillant', 'One', 'things', 'regretably', 'was', 'Depp', 'performance', 'Only', 'bit', 'more', 'animated', 'performance', 'Astronaut', 'Wife', 'Depp', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'be', 'sleeping', 'role', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'quot', 'guy', 'quot', 'role', 'movie', 'Nick', 'Time', 'truth', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'heck', 'lot', 'more', 'work', 'Polanski', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'characters', 'movie', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'cartoony', 'dramatic', 'got', 'odd', 'mix', '2', 'Just', 'listen', 'lines', 'Depp', 'dead', 'book', 'owners', 'wife', 'have', 'just', 'finished', 'mking', 'love', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'here', 'line', 'smirking', 'camera', 'something', 'campy', 'spy', 'movie', 'also', 'annoying', 'bit', 'Polanski', 'not', 'introducing', 'when', 'amp', 'where', 'scenes', 'Depp', 'NY', 'Portugal', 'Spain', 'Polanski', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'just', 'where', 'character', 'now', 'sometimes', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'Sometimes', 'viewer', 'came', 'middle', 'picture', 'when', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'start', 'However', 'film', 'hold', 'viewer', 'attention', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'apocolyptic', 'snoozer', 'End', 'Days', 'almost', '2', 'amp', '1/2', 'hour', 'length', 'performances', 'are', 'genuinely', 'eerie', 'Frank', 'Langellas', 'just', 'listen', 'voice', 'phone', 'going', 'anti-climactic', 'artistic', 'ending', 'was', 'wrong', 'move', 'left', 'oddly', 'enough', 'feeling', 'was', 'taken', 'much', 'Corso', 'clientele', 'movie', 'picture', 'was', 'shot', 'nicely', 'enough', 'amp', 'had', 'terrific', 'music', 'included', 'bit', 'almost', 'sounded', 'Jaws', 'theme', 'think', 'Polanski', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'given', 'viewers', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'spectacular', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'beleive', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'often']",The Ninth Gate

However, what lies in The Ninth Gate is a creepy, atmospheric suspense/horror film that is more than worth a watch.  Johnny Depp stars as a rare book authenticator named Dean Corso, who becomes employed by a demonologist played by Frank Langella to authenticate a rare book that, according to legend, was written by the devil.  Corso ends up going across Europe when he uncovers a vast conspiracy to find the book, and Depp is at his most cynical in his role.  If it wasn't for Depp than The Ninth Gate would lose most of it's charm; one of the reasons I like Depp so much as an actor is the eclectic roles he takes in some of the daring films he has done.  Films which he powered like Edward Scissorhands, Nick of Time, Sleepy Hollow, and Dead Man are all films that most actors wouldn't dare take a role in, but Depp has always been a daring actor, and The Ninth Gate belongs in that category.  Director Roman Polanski uses some great camera work and the creeped out atmosphere adds to the film, along with the fact that the atmosphere makes you feel like you never know what is lurking around the corner or is just outside the frame of the camera, all of which adds to the suspense making The Ninth Gate a great thriller.

There are no cheap x-effects or grotesque demons, a nice plot-twist at the end and on the whole it can be called &quot;an intellectual thriller&quot;.However, if you HAVE READ the book, the poor plot of the movie can't be even compared with a subtle puzzle of two sub-plots of the book (the Satanist one and the Dumas one) that hold your attention till the last pages, tons of information provided on ancient books, their authors and culture of collecting books, as well as on A Dumas, &quot;the Three Musketeers&quot; and their prototypes.I advise you: 1) Watch this movie 2) Read the wonderful book 3) See for yourself how, for the hundredth time, a good book turned into a mediocre script as a victim for Director's ambition &quot;to please everyone&quot; and not to burden the audience with &quot;intellectual ballast&quot;.

482694,A2TFV7IJSKJPTS,6305897786,Oliver Sheppard,"[14, 17]","- CAUTION: SPOILERS BELOW -I first saw Ninth Gate at the theater in 1999 or 2000 and I'm convinced that that is the best way to see this movie. Lights low, huge picture in front of you, rich, booming sound. The opening credits are great; Polish musician Wojciech Kilar's opening theme is excellent and sets an appropriate tone of weariness and dread. Some of the pluckier parts of the soundtrack don't seem to mesh too well, or seem dated -- but the opening theme is masterfully done.The movie concerns a book dealer's attempts to piece together the three known copies of a medieval tome that was supposedly co-written by Lucifer in 1666. Yes, co-authored by Lucifer himself. Apparently Lucifer likes to sign his name ""LCF,"" the movie shows, and he does engravings, too. Piecing together all Lucifer's drawings in the 3 extant copies of the 'The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows,' a book that reminds of the Necronomicon, enables one to summon the dark lord. Or so the theory goes.Depp does an adequate, low-key job as the unscrupulous book collector in search of the volumes on behalf of a wealthy New York client (Frank Langella). As others have mentioned, you do get the feeling that some sort of unspeakable evil is always JUST around the corner. But after awhile it begins to feel like a big put-on. Is anything going to ever happen or not? The pacing of the plot is deliberate, even langorous, and there is a good amount of suspense and unease, ladled on thick and grey in various European settings. The characters are interesting and even eerie (the two book makers in Portugal, for example).There are some moments, however, where the film seems to devolve into self-parody. For example, when you think of it, Satan himself, sitting around, doing drawings, and planting them in 3 different books -- well, that's kind of absurd, no? Nonetheless, if you don't think about such minutaie too much, you can enjoy the atmosphere and moodiness the movie conjures. One failing of the movie was when Depp's character, Corso, encounters the pack of Satanists at a secluded European mansion. This scene, which should have been climactic, seems to want to play like EYES WIDE SHUT, and it does sort of play that way -- but it's EYES WIDE SHUT as directed for the old 80s TV show Amazing Stories. Kind of hokey. In fact, some moments of this scene are laughably bad: One of the female Satanists, for some reason, hastily strips off her black silk robe and scuttles away naked, as if she'd just seen Godzilla approaching Mt. Fuji. Granted, fleeing is one thing -- but stripping off your clothes as you do so? Why was this put here? What the heck, Roman Polanski? Another Satanist looks like a Renassance Fair enthusiast, in long hair and a pony tail. And when Frank Langella strides into the scene, dressed like lawyer Melvin Belli in the Rolling Stones' GIMME SHELTER, proclaiming, ""Mumbo jumbo! Mumbo jumbo! Mumbo jumbo!"" it's hard not to laugh.The ending also felt antclimactic. I remember in the theater that folks sat in hushed silence as the credits came up, and there was a feeling of disbelief that that confused, ambiguous little bit at the end really was the ending. (You'll know what I mean when you see it.)If someone else other than Roman Polanski had made this movie -- a new director, perhaps -- you'd think, ""Hmm, this was uneven but it had its moments. I can't wait to see what this director does in the next few years."" But since it *is* Polanski and you expect a degree of excellence from him, it's a let down -- of sorts. ROSEMARY'S BABY and REPULSION are far superior to this. But if you have seen THE TENANT, Polanski's last of his unofficial trilogy of which REPULSION & ROSEMARY'S were the first two parts, well, it's about on level with that. THE TENANT was also a good, suspenseful, disturbing movie that nonetheless delivered a confusing, unsatisfying ending and had uneven, silly moments.I'm torn between recommending this or not. I give it 3 stars. I wish I could say 3 and a half. It's not bad. But it just isn't as great as we know Polanski is capable of. Go into it with low expectations and you may be surprised.",3,"Problematic, uneven, yet intriguing and suspenseful movie",1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,4142,"['CAUTION', 'SPOILERS', '-I', 'first', 'saw', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'theater', '1999', '2000', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'best', 'way', 'see', 'movie', 'Lights', 'low', 'huge', 'picture', 'front', 'rich', 'booming', 'sound', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'great', 'Polish', 'musician', 'Wojciech', 'Kilar', 'opening', 'theme', 'excellent', 'appropriate', 'tone', 'weariness', 'dread', 'pluckier', 'parts', 'soundtrack', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'mesh', 'too', 'well', 'seem', 'dated', 'opening', 'theme', 'masterfully', 'done.The', 'movie', 'concerns', 'book', 'dealer', 'attempts', 'piece', 'together', 'three', 'known', 'copies', 'medieval', 'tome', 'was', 'supposedly', 'co-written', 'Lucifer', '1666', 'Yes', 'co-authored', 'Lucifer', 'Apparently', 'Lucifer', 'sign', 'name', 'LCF', 'movie', 'engravings', 'too', 'Piecing', 'together', 'Lucifer', 'drawings', '3', 'extant', 'copies', ""'The"", 'Nine', 'Gates', 'Kingdom', 'Shadows', 'book', 'Necronomicon', 'one', 'summon', 'dark', 'lord', 'so', 'theory', 'goes.Depp', 'adequate', 'low-key', 'job', 'unscrupulous', 'book', 'collector', 'search', 'volumes', 'behalf', 'wealthy', 'New', 'York', 'client', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'do', 'get', 'feeling', 'sort', 'unspeakable', 'evil', 'always', 'JUST', 'corner', 'feel', 'big', 'put-on', 'anything', 'going', 'ever', 'happen', 'not', 'pacing', 'plot', 'deliberate', 'even', 'langorous', 'good', 'amount', 'suspense', 'unease', 'ladled', 'thick', 'grey', 'various', 'European', 'settings', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'even', 'eerie', 'two', 'book', 'makers', 'Portugal', 'example', 'are', 'moments', 'however', 'where', 'film', 'devolve', 'self-parody', 'example', 'when', 'think', 'Satan', 'sitting', 'around', 'doing', 'drawings', 'planting', '3', 'different', 'books', 'well', 'kind', 'absurd', 'Nonetheless', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'such', 'minutaie', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'enjoy', 'atmosphere', 'moodiness', 'movie', 'One', 'failing', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'Depp', 'character', 'Corso', 'pack', 'Satanists', 'secluded', 'European', 'mansion', 'scene', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'climactic', 'want', 'play', 'EYES', 'WIDE', 'SHUT', 'sort', 'play', 'way', 'EYES', 'WIDE', 'SHUT', 'directed', 'old', '80s', 'TV', 'show', 'Amazing', 'Stories', 'Kind', 'hokey', 'fact', 'moments', 'scene', 'are', 'laughably', 'bad', 'One', 'female', 'Satanists', 'reason', 'hastily', 'black', 'silk', 'robe', 'away', 'naked', ""'d"", 'just', 'seen', 'Godzilla', 'approaching', 'Mt', 'Fuji', 'Granted', 'fleeing', 'one', 'thing', 'stripping', 'off', 'clothes', 'do', 'so', 'Why', 'was', 'put', 'here', 'What', 'heck', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'Satanist', 'looks', 'Renassance', 'Fair', 'enthusiast', 'long', 'hair', 'pony', 'tail', 'when', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'scene', 'dressed', 'lawyer', 'Melvin', 'Belli', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'GIM', 'ME', 'SHELTER', 'proclaiming', 'Mumbo', 'jumbo', 'Mumbo', 'jumbo', 'Mumbo', 'jumbo', 'hard', 'not', 'laugh.The', 'ending', 'also', 'felt', 'antclimactic', 'remember', 'theater', 'sat', 'hushed', 'silence', 'credits', 'came', 'up', 'there', 'was', 'feeling', 'disbelief', 'confused', 'ambiguous', 'little', 'bit', 'end', 'really', 'was', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'see', 'someone', 'else', 'other', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'had', 'made', 'movie', 'new', 'director', 'perhaps', ""'d"", 'think', 'Hmm', 'was', 'uneven', 'had', 'moments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'director', 'next', 'few', 'years', '*is*', 'Polanski', 'expect', 'degree', 'excellence', 'let', 'down', 'sorts', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'REPULSION', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'have', 'seen', 'THE', 'TENANT', 'Polanski', 'last', 'unofficial', 'trilogy', 'REPULSION', 'ROSEMARY', 'were', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'well', 'level', 'TENANT', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'suspenseful', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'delivered', 'confusing', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'had', 'uneven', 'silly', 'moments.I', ""'m"", 'torn', 'recommending', 'not', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'wish', 'could', 'say', '3', 'half', 'not', 'bad', 'just', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'know', 'Polanski', 'capable', 'Go', 'low', 'expectations', 'may', 'be', 'surprised']",The Ninth Gate

For instance, it was My Best Friend's Wedding for Julia Roberts, Winter's Bone for Jennifer Lawrence, True Romance for Brad Pitt imho.I really never got the appeal of Johnny Depp until I saw the current movie under consideration, The Ninth Gate. He's gaunt, delicate, selfish, and pretty smart. Not only that, but the movie is directed by Roman Polanksi. Forget Rosemary's Baby; I think Polanski only did that for the entre, and the money of course. For me, his signature piece is Chinatown. But he returns to the occult a la Rosemary's Baby with much of the finesse of Chinatown.I'm not going to go into too much detail but if you're looking for a theater-seat gripping slasher film, don't bother. Personally, I think the movie is far more deeply scary ... it seems to threaten to do the very thing the holy grail, using that term loosely, which everyone in the movie is seeking is supposed to do. Sorry to be so cryptic, trying to avoid spoilers. The pace is slow, yes, but I found it thoughtful ... very involving. Polanski seems to take care with every detail of the film, too, down to the reflections in Depp's glasses.If you're a literary type who can sit still to read a book for a while, this movie may be for you, not the least of reasons being that it is about rare book collectors and sleuths. It perhaps disappoints at the end with an ending that may raise more questions than it answers but could stir debate.

It was like they were cheap paperback editions of last year's bestsellers.  My first shock was his associate's Rare Book Store that was below street level.  What would happen in case of a lengthy downpore?!!?  No one would place such valued tomes in such fragile confines.  Next I noticed that he didn't use gloves when handling the books or when turning the pages (he didn't even wash his hands).  He carries around one of three existing 18th Century (or was it older) books in a canvas satchel.  I noticed in the pouring rain he still had the satchel nonchalantly swinging by his side.  As the movie contined, he would smoke cigarettes while leafing through the pages and studying the various etchings.  It was too much for me.  ARGGHH!

482717,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6305897786,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","As Polanski has become increasingly reclusive and eccentric, I've often wondered exactly what goes through his head when he decides to film something. I've been wondering it more and more over the last two decades or so, as what little output Polanski has released has become increasingly  humorless, bitter, and savage, culminating in the brilliantly unstable  Death and the Maiden in 1994. Something seems to have happened in the past  six years, however. Polanski has given us his finest, and funniest, film  since The Fealress Vampire Killers-- and for much the same reasons.There is a subgenre of film, mostly horror film (but a good number of  what can only be termed &quot;men's adventure&quot; flicks also fall into  this category), that can best be described as &quot;fuzzy.&quot; Everything  about them is fuzzy. The focus is just a tad off. The soundtrack sounds as  if it has been recorded through a wad of cotton. The color is a little off.  You know the genre. Karen Black is probably its most enduring star, and  Dario Argento has directed about eight hundred fuzzy flicks. Many people  see fuzzy and translate to low-quality, thus dismissing a whole subgenre of  often brilliant filmmaking-- Argento, Lucio Fulci, Carpenter's early work,  Wes Craven, early David Lynch, etc. But we often forget where the original  fuzzy came from. Coppola and Corman got together for the classic Dementia  13 (1963), right in the middle of Polanski's trilogy of distressing imagery  (Knife in the Water, The Beautiful Swindlers, and Repulsion). It is  probably from these four films, and their styles of production and  direction, that this whole subgenre came about, and its first true champion  recognized by a wider audience was yet another Polanski all-star  extravaganza, Rosemary's Baby (1968).In The Ninth Gate, Polanski,  who has a lot more money now, has given us the epitome of what makes fuzzy  filmmaking great, but he's ramped up the budget, attracted fantastic  starpower and the highest quality of production, and essentially made a  great seventies satan-worshipper film (remember Ernest Borgnine in The  Devil's Rain? Heh...) in the new century. Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso, a  rare book mercenary of sorts, hired by the shifty-eyed Boris Balkan (Frank  Langella) to track down the two other remaining copies of a book Balkan now  owns. Balkan is convinced that, of these three books, one is an authentic  copy and two are forgeries, and Corso's job is to discover which is the  actual tome in question (and, one can assume from Balkan's persona, to  switch the fake with the authentic one, assuming Balkan has a fake).The truth, of course, is nowhere near as simple as this, and as Corso  goes on his journey, attended by the breathtakingly beautiful nameless  stranger (Polanski's present spouse, Emmanuelle Seigner) and a few people  seemingly less concerned with Corso's welfare (Lena Olin, as the widow of  the original owner of Balkan's copy of the book in question, and her  bodyguard/hired hand/whatever, an unnamed character played by a chap I've  never seen before).The Ninth Gate also falls into another subgenre  of film, and it doesn't have a name, but when you see the film, it  immediately bears comparison to others of its type-- films that there are  two kinds of viewers for, those who will willingly suspend all possible  belief and enjoy the hell out of it, and those who just won't get it. The  film that springs immediately to mind, of course, is The Blair Witch  Project, but that's only because of recency; Cronenberg's masterpiece of  twisted illusion, Videodrome, is a much better comparison when all is said  and done. Similarly to Videodrome, the viewer is always given the sensation  that something is a little off, and that perhaps the real action is always  going on somewhere just off camera; Depp is embroiled in the same kind of  seemingly-predestined confusion as Woods (and it helps that both have this  odd woman following them around and showing up in the oddest places-- in  Woods' case, Debbie Harry was the vixen in question). If you thought  Videodrome was a fantastic piece of work, and that James Woods turned in  the performance of his career, you'll probably walk out of The Ninth Gate  feeling exactly the same way I did about it--&quot;wow.&quot;There's  been a lot made, in the press, of the pace of the movie. &quot;Johnny Depp  runs around Europe looking for old books.&quot; Sure. If you go into a  Roman Polanski flick expecting something that could have been cut from the  same cloth as the Friday the Thirteenth movies, you're bound to be  disappointed. Polanski is a master of the atmospheric horror film, where  the horror is more suggested than splattered, as Rosemary's Baby,  Repulsion, and Death and the Maiden are tribute to. Nothing less should be  expected from The Ninth Gate, and Polanski delivers on all counts. This  isn't a scary film so much as it is a disturbing one, suspenseful at times  (only one car chase, thankfully!), and laugh-out-loud funny at others.Special consideration, come this time next year, should probably be  given to sound and sound effects editing (the ambient soundtrack to the  film is one of the better ones of recent years-- if The Haunting had had  this music, it would have been almost watchable) and Best Supporting Actor  for a person who usually stays behind the camera, Jose Lopez Rodero, in a  double role as the Brothers Ceniza. He-- they-- are one of the film's many  highlights, despite their small role. Cinematography here is wide and  brilliant, as well; Polanski takes us on a whirlwind trip through some of  Europe's most picturesque spots, including the backstreets of Portugal  (where the Cenizas' shop lies) and a stunning collapsing villa that is the  home of Victor Fargas, one of the other owners of the book in question  (played handily by Jack Taylor, best known for acting in those  aforementioned men's adventure titles in Italy). Depp probably still won't  get his well-deserved Best Actor nomination, and his role doesn't really  warrant it, though the panache and humor he brings to it make it that much  the finer; it wouldn't be too much of a surprise to see Polanski up for  either Director or Adapted Screenplay, however.It's probably not for  everyone....",4,Polanski's funniest since The Fearless Vampire

482718,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,6305897786,Robert J. Crawford,"[3, 4]","This film is vintage Polanski:  there is little moral certitude, even if you are dealing with Satan, ruthless and evil acolytes, and a con man, expertly acted by Depp.  Instead, you find a coherent and frightening journey of discovery and ambiguity.  Depp is charged with examining the authenticity of some rare books, which is his profession, though he is also an unscrupulous and sleazy near-thief.  As with all great actors, his every gesture exudes his personal confusion, ambition, and cynical humor - a complete personality and even an entire environment.After witnessing a number of alarming crimes, he single-mindedly pursues his task (for which he is handsomely paid) and blithely ignores the destruction and murderous detritus as if walking though an obstacle course.  Along the way, he keeps running into a mysterious and very beautiful woman, who seems to be protecting him, yet also playfully mocking him before disappearing only to reappear in dangerous moments.  Looking not quite human yet vulnerable to injury, she seems to enjoy the evolution of Depp's character in a violent, unpredictable direction.  There is a frightening scene where she annoints him with her blood.  And the book:  the more he discovers, the deeper he gets in becoming almost a direct participant in the antique illustrations in the book, which he scrutinizes as more manuscripts come to light.  Depp's character emerges as something more than he appeared to be, though entirely lacking in simple definition.  It is truly masterful.The most beautiful aspect of the film is the sense - the feeling - of ominous mystery that pervades it.  In other words, there are many clues that must be interpreted, and the viewer never reaches the point of saying, ""oh, I get it"", which in lesser films is followed by ""that's it?""  I found this delightfully fascinating and evocative, particularly as much of it takes place in a region similar to the one I currently live in in France.  Typical of Polanski, this elevates the film to a higher art than other occult films, much as Rosemary's Baby did.  The mood of the film is completely consistent and demands (and deserves) the viewer's full attention.Warmly recommended.

482727,A269PFYNQB576V,6305897786,Ryan Sutton,"[1, 1]","The Ninth Gate really surprised me. Certainly, its no secret that Polanski is a talented director, but I never imagined anyone could make a half-way decent movie on the subject of satanism. Movies about the occult invariably degenerate into a scene where a bunch of weirdos sit around and chant gibberish. Then if it is really bad, a monster or something will actually appear, and its all down hill from there. If you dont believe me, check out Ghoulies.What really impressed me about the Ninth Gate was something that many people did not care for: the slow pace of the story. Too many movies staring high profile actors are in such a rush to get to the ending, and the ending more often that not is maddeningly predictable. Also, Johnnie Depp's performance as a rare book dealer was quite solid. In spite of the phoney tufts of grey hair, he didn't really look  like someone in his 40s. But something about his mannerisms and the cadence in his voice actually made him seem older. The other stand out performance was Frank Langellia, who was amazingly good as a wealthy satanist obsessed with collecting occult manuscripts. Emmanuelle Seigner (Polanski's wife) played the mystery girl, Depp's sidekick who occaisionally exhibited superhuman powers. I think the movie would have been better without this character - or at least without any characters having superhuman abilities. Seigner is a fine actress, but this is the sort of role that noone could pull off.Incidentally, this movie is based on a novel called ""The Dumas Club"". Although Polanski definitely used this book as a starting point, he discarded many characters and scenes and then inserted his own. Even getting away from a strict comparison of character/scene inventories, the tone of the movie was much creepier and mysterious than the book. Almost all references to Dumas and literature were stripped away, while occult elements of the storyline were emphasized. Also, the movie leaves several key questions unanswered, forcing the audience fill in the blanks. For instance, who (in the movie) was responsible for attempting to destroy copies of the Ninth Gate? Or just as importantly, what motivated them to do this in the first place? Unlike many contemporary directors, Polanski appreciates the importance of creating a little mystery for his audience.",4,Solid Occult Thriller,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,2323,"['Ninth', 'Gate', 'really', 'surprised', 'Certainly', 'secret', 'Polanski', 'talented', 'director', 'never', 'imagined', 'anyone', 'could', 'make', 'half-way', 'decent', 'movie', 'subject', 'satanism', 'Movies', 'occult', 'invariably', 'degenerate', 'scene', 'where', 'bunch', 'weirdos', 'sit', 'chant', 'gibberish', 'Then', 'really', 'bad', 'monster', 'something', 'will', 'actually', 'appear', 'down', 'hill', 'there', 'dont', 'believe', 'check', 'out', 'Ghoulies.What', 'really', 'impressed', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'was', 'something', 'many', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'slow', 'pace', 'story', 'Too', 'many', 'movies', 'staring', 'high', 'profile', 'actors', 'are', 'such', 'rush', 'get', 'ending', 'ending', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'maddeningly', 'predictable', 'Also', 'Johnnie', 'Depp', 'performance', 'rare', 'book', 'dealer', 'was', 'quite', 'solid', 'spite', 'phoney', 'tufts', 'grey', 'hair', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'someone', '40s', 'something', 'mannerisms', 'cadence', 'voice', 'actually', 'made', 'seem', 'older', 'other', 'stand', 'performance', 'was', 'Frank', 'Langellia', 'who', 'was', 'amazingly', 'good', 'wealthy', 'satanist', 'obsessed', 'collecting', 'occult', 'manuscripts', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner', 'Polanski', 'wife', 'played', 'mystery', 'girl', 'Depp', 'sidekick', 'who', 'occaisionally', 'exhibited', 'superhuman', 'powers', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'character', 'least', 'characters', 'having', 'superhuman', 'abilities', 'Seigner', 'fine', 'actress', 'sort', 'role', 'noone', 'could', 'pull', 'off.Incidentally', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', 'called', 'Dumas', 'Club', 'Polanski', 'definitely', 'used', 'book', 'starting', 'point', 'discarded', 'many', 'characters', 'scenes', 'then', 'inserted', 'own', 'Even', 'getting', 'away', 'strict', 'comparison', 'character/scene', 'inventories', 'tone', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'creepier', 'mysterious', 'book', 'Almost', 'references', 'Dumas', 'literature', 'were', 'stripped', 'away', 'occult', 'elements', 'storyline', 'were', 'emphasized', 'Also', 'movie', 'several', 'key', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'forcing', 'audience', 'fill', 'blanks', 'instance', 'who', 'movie', 'was', 'responsible', 'attempting', 'destroy', 'copies', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'just', 'importantly', 'what', 'motivated', 'do', 'first', 'place', 'many', 'contemporary', 'directors', 'Polanski', 'importance', 'creating', 'little', 'mystery', 'audience']",The Ninth Gate

He believes in his percentage and it is what drives him. Dean is summoned to the private library of a very wealthy publisher. There he is offered a huge payday if he will authenticate the publishers copy of  very rare demonic book. There are only three known copies of this book left. Dean is to take the publishers copy and compare it to the other two existing volumes. As soon as Dean leaves the publishers office, his world changes. There are things going on that Dean does not understand. He must be very careful if he is to discover what is really going on.My Opinion:  This is an awesome movie. It's deep and dark and creepy and has a sense of humor. Many things are hidden in this gem. To find its greatness you have to work though it. Many people don't like to do this especially when they are expecting entertainment. Don't be surprised if you don't understand it on the first viewing. It's not that kind of movie. It's not from the point of view that we are used to, so we distort what is going on to make it fit what we are used to. Dean Corso is not a good guy no mater how hard we try to see him as one. I tried. I rented this movie and ran out in the next two days and bought the book and the DVD. It's a kick in the pants. Listen closely to some of the music. It doesn't fit the scary scenes at times. I thought it goofy at first but really like it now. Johnny Depp is at his best fiddling with his glasses as Dean Corso. Maybe he'll let you borrow those glasses so you can see what is really going on too.DVD Quality: Widescreen anamorphic - 2.35:1, DD5.1. Audio and Video are great. Extras include commentary, Making of Documentary, Production Notes, and Trailers.What You Should Do:  Buy this DVD if you can handle working at a movie. The payoff is worth it. If you haven't seen it yet, then don't read any more reviews or spoilers. Jump right into the movie. Don't ruin it for yourself. If you have trouble with deep movies that need some work to figure out, then you should steer clear of this one.Related Movies To Check Out: Jacob's Ladder, The Sixth Sense, Rosemary's Baby",5,"What, The Devil Didn't Show Up?

482736,A1NRHJW5X9COX,6305897786,Scrivener,"[7, 11]","only because the director, Roman Polanski, is an old-fashioned craftsman who knows how to properly build a narrative, create atmosphere, shock you  with an unexpected visual, all the while studiously avoiding cliches . . .  and all without some big stupid explosion billowing in slo-mo while some  jerk runs toward the camera manfully  (again in slo-mo).  Withholding  information from the audience, then revealing it at the unexpected moments,  layering the characters -- in short, professional storytelling in the old  murder-mystery vein -- are lost arts which one typically has to go back to  the early 1980's to find, an era before computer technology and overbearing  camerawork made such painstaking craft no longer necessary to the  attention-span-deprived American audience.  *The Ninth Gate*  is all in the  details, baby.  If such nuances don't impress you, or seem boring to you,  better look elsewhere.  *End of Days*  would be a fine start.  No nuances  there to  &quot;bog&quot;  you down.Having said all that, I must say  that this movie lacked a couple of key ingredients that would have made it  an emotionally satisfying picture.  Number one, having the Depp character  be SUCH a moral blank, especially as the film progresses, only serves to  deflate the tension -- in other words, nothing seems to be at stake.  Depp's soul is already lost; so is going to Hell any sort of change?  Also,  Polanski played his hand a bit early with the Mystery Blonde Girl.  Once  she starts floating in the air and kicking people around a la The  Incredible Hulk, it's no secret that she's a minion of Satan  (or even  Satan Himself -- it scarcely matters).  MORE mystery, not LESS, was needed  where she's concerned.  And the movie is really too long -- especially when  you consider the puzzling finish, which is really a confusing muddle . . .  unnecessarily confusing, I may add.All in all, though, one of the more  satisfying movies of last year, especially for those who enjoy the craft of  filmmaking itself.  Those who require kickboxing matches once per half-hour  and actors floating through the soupy-looking air of CGI  &quot;magic&quot;, need not apply. . . .",4,You may have to be over 30 to enjoy this. . . .,966211200,"08 14, 2000",2000,2176,"['only', 'director', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'old-fashioned', 'craftsman', 'who', 'how', 'properly', 'build', 'narrative', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'shock', 'unexpected', 'visual', 'while', 'studiously', 'avoiding', 'cliches', 'big', 'stupid', 'explosion', 'billowing', 'slo-mo', 'jerk', 'camera', 'manfully', 'again', 'slo-mo', 'Withholding', 'information', 'audience', 'then', 'revealing', 'unexpected', 'moments', 'layering', 'characters', 'short', 'professional', 'storytelling', 'old', 'murder-mystery', 'vein', 'are', 'lost', 'arts', 'one', 'typically', 'go', 'back', 'early', '1980', 'find', 'era', 'computer', 'technology', 'overbearing', 'camerawork', 'made', 'such', 'painstaking', 'craft', 'no', 'longer', 'necessary', 'attention-span-deprived', 'American', 'audience', '*The', 'Ninth', 'Gate*', 'details', 'baby', 'such', 'nuances', 'do', ""n't"", 'impress', 'seem', 'boring', 'better', 'look', 'elsewhere', '*End', 'Days*', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'start', 'nuances', 'there', 'quot', 'quot', 'down.Having', 'said', 'must', 'say', 'movie', 'lacked', 'couple', 'key', 'ingredients', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'emotionally', 'satisfying', 'picture', 'Number', 'one', 'having', 'Depp', 'character', 'be', 'SUCH', 'moral', 'blank', 'especially', 'film', 'only', 'deflate', 'tension', 'other', 'words', 'nothing', 'be', 'stake', 'Depp', 'soul', 'already', 'lost', 'going', 'Hell', 'sort', 'change', 'Also', 'Polanski', 'played', 'hand', 'bit', 'early', 'Mystery', 'Blonde', 'Girl', 'floating', 'air', 'kicking', 'people', 'la', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'secret', 'minion', 'Satan', 'even', 'Satan', 'Himself', 'scarcely', 'matters', 'MORE', 'mystery', 'not', 'LESS', 'was', 'needed', 'where', 'concerned', 'movie', 'really', 'too', 'long', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'puzzling', 'finish', 'really', 'confusing', 'muddle', 'unnecessarily', 'confusing', 'may', 'add.All', 'though', 'one', 'more', 'satisfying', 'movies', 'last', 'year', 'especially', 'who', 'enjoy', 'craft', 'filmmaking', 'who', 'require', 'kickboxing', 'matches', 'once', 'half-hour', 'actors', 'floating', 'soupy-looking', 'air', 'CGI', 'quot', 'quot', 'need', 'not', 'apply']",The Ninth Gate

Johnny Depp was great as Corso and while I dislike Seigneur as the ""Girl,"" she was perfectly creepy for this part.It was totally scary and fascinating at the same time, especially about the obsessions with old books by collectors to the point where morality ceases to exist.  It also points out the emptiness of people's lives where they have to turn to playing with fire, such as seeking out the devil (they can find the devil on any street corner and in Congress and the White House).  Others seek out religion to avoid reality.But, mainly, I loved it for a good horror story that it was.  And the soundtrack was truly wonderful.  It introduced me to the gorgeous voice of Sumi Jo, and made me a fan forever.And it had the benefit of introducing me to the works of Arture Perez-Reverte, a wonderful Spanish author.  The Club Dumas, however, had more going on than the movie, which focused on only one part of the book (much like the film version of East of Eden only focused on the last 100 pages of the book).And the ending was no surprise!b Spoiler AheadCorso wound up exactly where he wanted to go: to Hades to meet the Devil, although he did meet him/her.

482741,ADLN37B0153N,6305897786,Silmarwen,"[3, 5]","Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a book hunter.  He finds rare and valuable old books and sells them.  He has no scruples and doesn't mind ripping off clients or lying to them to make them think that their collection is both more valuable and/or less valuable than it really is.  Corso does not really have morals and doesn't believe that God and Lucifer still have power in this world.  So when Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) approaches Corso and asks him to authenticate a rare book purportedly written by Lucifer himself, Corso takes the job.  Within hours of his acquiring Balkan's copy, Corso's friend is dead and he is being propositioned by Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) whose husband originally owned Balkan's copy.  Corso briefly entertains the notion of backing out, but Balkan's promise of more money keeps him on the job.Once Corso has a chance to examine the book, he notices that 2 of the illustrations in the book are signed &quot;LFR&quot; instead of by the original artist.  Intrigued, he approaches Victor Fargas (Jack Taylor), a rare book collector who owns one of the other 2 copies of the book.  Sure enough, once he has examined it, he notices that 2 different illustrations with subtle, but telling differences were signed &quot;LFR&quot;.  Unfortunately, Fargas is unwilling to part with the book and throws Corso out when he discovers who he is.  But Corso is not so easily dissuaded and, when he returns the following morning, he finds Fargas dead and takes the book.  He then travels to Paris to see Baroness Kessler's (Barbara Jefford) copy, but she refuses to even let Corso see the book, until he explains the differences in illustrations.  She turns up mysteriously dead also and Corso finds himself with all three copies and all of the illustrations labels &quot;LFR&quot;.  Supposedly Corso now has all that he needs to summon Lucifer and gain some of his power, but he doesn't believe in stuff like that, does he?The Ninth Gate is one of those utterly creepy movies that you both love and you hate.  I loved Johnny Depp's performance in this movie.  He was simply amazing in the way he took this character who is scum and made you care for him and made you like him and want him to win.  He starts off bad and he ends up worse, yet I felt myself urging him on and hoping he would end up the winner.  Roman Polanski did a superb job in making everything look threatening and mysterious.  He also throws off the viewers by adding in random things like Emmanuelle Siegner, a girl who follows Corso around.  You never know if she is a friend or a foe or exactly what she is, but you know that she is definitely not a &quot;good&quot; person.  Wojciech Kilar's music was very influential in the film and really makes your flesh crawl with his mesmerizing theme to the film.  However, the movie is missing a tight plot and it kind of meanders around and so you are never quite sure if you understand what is happening or not.  Also, I was not interested in learning about demonology and found the whole idea of conjuring up Lucifer to be ludicrous, but I was fascinated by the movie nonetheless.  Take the time to watch this film and I believe that you will find yourself both entranced and repulsed as I was.",4,A Movie That I Loved...And Hated,1078444800,"03 5, 2004",2004,3226,"['Dean', 'Corso', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'book', 'hunter', 'rare', 'valuable', 'old', 'books', 'scruples', ""n't"", 'mind', 'ripping', 'off', 'clients', 'lying', 'make', 'think', 'collection', 'more', 'valuable', 'and/or', 'less', 'valuable', 'really', 'Corso', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'morals', ""n't"", 'believe', 'God', 'Lucifer', 'still', 'have', 'power', 'world', 'So', 'when', 'Boris', 'Balkan', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Corso', 'authenticate', 'rare', 'book', 'purportedly', 'written', 'Lucifer', 'Corso', 'job', 'Within', 'hours', 'acquiring', 'Balkan', 'copy', 'Corso', 'friend', 'dead', 'being', 'propositioned', 'Liana', 'Telfer', 'Lena', 'Olin', 'husband', 'originally', 'owned', 'Balkan', 'copy', 'Corso', 'briefly', 'notion', 'backing', 'out', 'Balkan', 'promise', 'more', 'money', 'job.Once', 'Corso', 'chance', 'examine', 'book', '2', 'illustrations', 'book', 'are', 'signed', 'quot', 'LFR', 'quot', 'instead', 'original', 'artist', 'Intrigued', 'Victor', 'Fargas', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'rare', 'book', 'collector', 'who', 'one', 'other', '2', 'copies', 'book', 'Sure', 'enough', 'once', 'examined', '2', 'different', 'illustrations', 'subtle', 'telling', 'differences', 'were', 'signed', 'quot', 'LFR', 'quot', 'Unfortunately', 'Fargas', 'unwilling', 'part', 'book', 'Corso', 'out', 'when', 'who', 'Corso', 'not', 'so', 'easily', 'dissuaded', 'when', 'following', 'morning', 'Fargas', 'dead', 'book', 'then', 'Paris', 'see', 'Baroness', 'Kessler', 'Barbara', 'Jefford', 'copy', 'even', 'let', 'Corso', 'see', 'book', 'differences', 'illustrations', 'up', 'mysteriously', 'dead', 'also', 'Corso', 'three', 'copies', 'illustrations', 'labels', 'quot', 'LFR', 'quot', 'Supposedly', 'Corso', 'now', 'summon', 'Lucifer', 'gain', 'power', ""n't"", 'believe', 'stuff', 'Ninth', 'Gate', 'one', 'utterly', 'creepy', 'movies', 'love', 'hate', 'loved', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'performance', 'movie', 'was', 'simply', 'amazing', 'way', 'took', 'character', 'who', 'scum', 'made', 'care', 'made', 'want', 'win', 'bad', 'up', 'worse', 'felt', 'urging', 'hoping', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'winner', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'making', 'everything', 'look', 'threatening', 'mysterious', 'also', 'viewers', 'adding', 'random', 'things', 'Emmanuelle', 'Siegner', 'girl', 'who', 'Corso', 'never', 'know', 'friend', 'foe', 'exactly', 'what', 'know', 'definitely', 'not', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'person', 'Wojciech', 'Kilar', 'music', 'was', 'very', 'influential', 'film', 'really', 'flesh', 'crawl', 'mesmerizing', 'theme', 'film', 'However', 'movie', 'missing', 'tight', 'plot', 'kind', 'meanders', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'understand', 'what', 'happening', 'not', 'Also', 'was', 'not', 'interested', 'learning', 'demonology', 'found', 'whole', 'idea', 'conjuring', 'up', 'Lucifer', 'be', 'ludicrous', 'was', 'fascinated', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'Take', 'time', 'watch', 'film', 'believe', 'will', 'find', 'entranced', 'repulsed', 'was']",The Ninth Gate

Sometimes less is more.Many don't like the pacing of the movie, for Polanski uses many developing shots and slow pans and dollies, but this is effective in creating a certain uneasiness and atmosphere.Polanski is much like Kubrik in his attention to detail and buildup of atmosphere and character, and not all viewers are accustomed to this style or care for it. It all comes down to personal preference I suppose.The DVD is loaded with extras including commentary by Polanski which was very insightful. Highly recommended.

Johnny Depp's acting is good, but his somewhat scrawny body and his aged looks just weren't the reason why this movie kept me in my seat throughout. No doubt the story isn't very realistic - its basically about the forces - mainly the evil forces - in life - greed, lust, power... and Johnny Depp plays an underhanded book dealer who is employed by Balkan (Langella) to go on a trip to Europe to research an ancient Satanic book's authenticity. This entire movie is about Johnny Depp taking one long and life-threatening adventure tackling issues beyond what he normally avoids in real life.Emmanuelle Seigner (and this is just some gossip for you - she's Polanski's wife in real-life!) plays the mysterious woman who appears to help Depp everytime he's faced with a life-or-death situation, and this casts suspicion on her true identity - is she human or is she not? What is she? These are all the questions that Polanski poses to the viewer as you go through the film watching Depp go through his journey which seems to be like a cat-and-mouse chase between him and the greedy people who are after the book's secrets. Seigner is completely mesmerising in her own right. She is very interesting to watch and so charismatic - and rightly so because Polanski filmed her in such a way that drenched her in an even deeper aura of mystery. Olin is good too, she is very convincing in a somewhat shallow role as an out-and-out money-grubbing chic French tramp who bites (literally).There are certainly loads of questions left unanswered in the movie, but I think this is the intention of the director who wants you the viewer to make out the story how you want to see it. If you like a movie that features a great cast (albeit not your usual &quot;teen heart-throb&quot; Hollywood stars) shot in an European countryside backdrop, and a theme about the &quot;dark forces&quot; that leaves you thinking a bit - then you're sure to enjoy watching this.

482752,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,6305897786,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[3, 4]","I enjoyed this story because I like when a story turns into a story about something else. (SPOILER) Corso was hired to compare several books to check for authenticity, but the actual story became how Corso eventually volunteered to become the devil's apprentice - sort of an origin story from the villan's point of view. As I had no idea going in that that was the story's subject, as Corso himself didn't know until the story's end that he would be serving the devil, I liked the way the story unfolded. Though Corso was morally flexible (the story began with him cheating a old sick man out of a valuable collection), I didn't see why the devil would find him so appealing that the devil (she, in this story), would protect Corso until he reached the ninth gate. In other words, except that a movie star played the role, I saw no skill set exhibited that would make Corso so attractive that the devil would protect him, as though he were a valuable commodity. Corso was willing to lie and cheat, but as he is often in the midst of devil worshippers and/or murderers in this story, his behavior, though bad, was lightweight awful when compared to some of the other characters - in other words he didn't seem more evil than the other evildoers, in several instances, he seemed less evil, so apparently, in this film the devil wasn't looking for outright evil.  What characteristics the devil sought then, were not clearly specified, which I didn't like.  Something I did like was how the devil protected her protege; often film villans rat out their team so frequently, the audience wonders how they acquire assistants; it was believable to see a story where the villan takes care of her own.  I  didn't like the way the story ended, with Corso going through the ninth gate - at that point I felt the story was just beginning and I wanted to know his fate.  Also, I didn't understand why Corso wanted to join the devil's team in the end. Corso had sex with the devil right before he joined up, and the audience witnesses that, but the devil wasn't the only person he had sex with in the story, and he seemed to enjoy the other sex as well, so I didn't understand why sex with the devil in and of itself was so appealing that Corso would change his entire way of life.  Story was weak there. Though satan was a character in the film, the film was not at all scary, more a thriller. Overall, I liked the way the story was told - it could have been titled, how I became the devil's apprentice, and I liked that I got to discover that that was the story. After I saw that that was the story, I thought the story should have explained: (1) why did the devil want Corso, and (2) why did Corso want the devil.

Why 9th? What are gates zero to eight for? They are simply plates of engravings that lead the chosen suitor to obtain the 9th plate/gate, which helps the right suitor identify his lover. Rather, should we say the 9th plate is plate zero, the actual plate he needs to find. Ground zero, towards which the other nine plates would lead the suitor.Is this her ultimate companion, the only one admitted thro the gate or is he yet another companion who would help her write another set of puzzles? Rather, is that it - the extraterrestrial, the dragon rider, is going home as she's finally found her lover?",5,An angel in devil's clothing,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,2044,"['People', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'see', 'the/a', 'devil', 'action', 'movie', 'will', 'see', 'none.Satan', 'mocks', 'who', 'worships', 'such', 'being', 'movie', 'secrecy', 'rituals', 'who', 'either', 'worship', 'revile', 'her.Certainly', 'most', 'sacred', 'angels', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'degraded', 'being', 'worshiped', 'humans', 'hide', 'purity', 'mask', 'perceived', 'eternal', 'evil', 'desire', 'persistent', 'companion.Companions', 'finite', 'lives', 'would', 'help', 'find', 'next', 'desired', 'companion', 'companion', 'resourceful', 'enough', 'match', 'puzzle', 'previous', 'companion', 'had', 'devised', 'Others', 'fail', 'one', 'fancies', 'who', 'her.Thro', '9th', 'Gate', 'eternal', 'companion', 'Perhaps', 'extraterrestrial', 'not', 'even', 'call', 'Satan', 'myth', 'Satan', 'producers', 'are', 'using', 'decoys', 'distract', 'audience', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'exquisite', 'deliberately', 'misleading', 'movie', 'using', 'established', 'religious', 'ideas', 'mislead', 'audience', 'finally', 'realising', 'are', 'watching', 'exotic', 'romance', 'movie', 'human', 'extraterrestrial.The', 'unsuspecting', 'chosen', 'one', 'unsuspecting', 'competing', 'suitors', 'unsuspectingly', 'perform', 'rituals', 'Are', 'rituals', 'actually', 'required', 'win', 'heart', 'are', 'rituals', 'simply', 'decoys', 'story', 'rituals', 'also', 'function', 'pointless', 'impediments', 'other', 'suitors', 'chosen', 'Why', '9th', 'What', 'are', 'zero', 'eight', 'are', 'simply', 'plates', 'engravings', 'lead', 'chosen', 'suitor', 'obtain', '9th', 'plate/gate', 'right', 'suitor', 'identify', 'lover', 'should', 'say', '9th', 'plate', 'plate', 'zero', 'actual', 'plate', 'find', 'Ground', 'zero', 'towards', 'other', 'nine', 'plates', 'would', 'lead', 'suitor.Is', 'ultimate', 'companion', 'only', 'one', 'admitted', 'gate', 'yet', 'companion', 'who', 'would', 'help', 'write', 'set', 'puzzles', 'Rather', 'extraterrestrial', 'dragon', 'rider', 'going', 'home', 'finally', 'found', 'lover']",The Ninth Gate

482761,A1FQVUPUE8G30O,6305897786,"""takintime""","[162, 182]","Empty your mind of all preconceived ideas about this film before viewing, and it will be a very worthwhile experience.  It is not a horror film.  It is definitely an occult film that takes a fresh look at the old theme of  His Unholiness making an appearance on earth.  The Ninth Gate has a  superior cast who perform their parts well under the direction of a  director with a worldwide reputation for genius, especially when it comes  to depicting the darker matters of the mind.  The film is what you would  expect from such a combination of human talent.  The strictly human  characters display themselves in such a way that it becomes possible to  read their minds and feel their motives.  In so doing, the necessity  of  the one supernatural character becomes abundantly clear.Johnny Depp  plays Curso, a dealer in and locator of rare books who, as Balkan  (Langella's character) points out, is worthy of trust because his loyalty  can be bought.  Balkan pays the right price to have Depp travel from New  York to Lisbon and Paris in search of the two other copies of a rare book  Balkan has recently acquired--one that was supposedly co-authored by the  Devil and one of his most loyal disciples, the latter of whom was burned at  the stake in the 1600's for his own loyalty.  Balkan insists that he thinks  only one copy of the book is genuine, and he wants to make sure his copy is  the one.It is obvious that Depp has no idea what he is getting himself  into, but for all his cynical disregard of humanity, he becomes the  &quot;innocent&quot; in this story, because he is the one person who  becomes aware and admits early on that he has no idea what he has gotten  into.  Balkan says he obtained his copy of the book in a true sale from the  owner just before the owner committed suicide.  However, the former owner's  widow insists that the book is hers and becomes the first person trying to  kill Curso in an effort to get it back--after the best of feminine wiles  don't get the job done.  At this point Curso's &quot;guardian angel&quot;,  whom he calls Green Eyes, enters the picture in the guise of a wandering  college student whose appearances at first inspire distrust and  apprehension until she begins the rather pleasant habit of repeatedly  saving Curso's life.The mysterious &quot;keys&quot; that will open the  Ninth Gate and let the Devil break through are contained in the set of nine  woodcuts within each book.  The woodcuts each contain interesting jumbled  adaptations of various images from the Tarot's Major Arcana--combinations  that give a clue to anyone familiar with the cards and their meanings that  everyone's traditional ideas regarding the occult were either dead wrong  all along or they are about to undergo--forgive the expression--one hell of  a change. Curso notes that there are significant variations in the woodcuts  in each volume of the three existing copies of the book.  Apparaently some  were drawn by the Devil himself and some by his advocate.Curso also  notes that he is now being hounded not only by the avaricious widow and her  hit man, but also by Balkan, who seems to know his every move, not to  mention having knowledge about the  violent deaths of the owners of the  other two manuscripts.  Finally it is revealed that Balkan and the widow  are involved in a literal battle to the death to become the Master who  controls the Ninth Gate and the group of Devil worshippers who are this  century's congregation of those who have been waiting for that Master since  the book was first printed 350 years earlier.There is humor throughout  this film, providing necessary comic relief at some very tense moments.  That humor is nowhere more evident than in the scene in which the widow  (who has managed to temporarily regain Balkan's copy of the book) is  leading the gathering of pathetic self-styled Satanists in an even more  pathetic, sterotypical black mass.  The scene at its opening is so mundane,  you want to groan.  Then as it progresses, you realize that is part of the  director's intentional imagery to show how stupid the theories about  conjuring up and dealing with Old Scratch have always been.This guy is  supposed to be the all powerful Prince of Darkness, right?  This is the guy  who can take your soul into hell for all eternity if you agree to the  arrangement.  And yet throughout history it is believed that if you draw a  circle around a pentagram on the ground or floor and stand in it, then  mutter a few incantations, the Devil will appear with his forked tail  between his legs and do whatever you ask.  This is the powerful adversary  of the Almighty?  Polanski has a very refreshing spin on that idea.In  The Ninth Gate we see Satan as a stronger contender--one perfectly capable  of appointing his &quot;chosen one&quot; among men.  Tired, evidently, of  insulting requests to preside as Master of Ceremonies at orgies and to give  individual megalomaniacs the power to rule the world, the Devil has decided  to run the show himself and to confer the honors of being his Commander in  Chief on a person who has proven himself a champion on the battlefield of  mundane evil.As for that &quot;obscure&quot; ending, we see Curso  walking alone toward the last eerie combination of Tarot symbols--The Star  (hope) imposed over the twin towers of The Moon (a card generally having to  do with the deepest and sometimes most sinister elements of the occult).  One tower is behind the other, giving the appearance of the two merging  into one Tower (symbol of total destruction).  Evidently the party games  are over.A richly textured, beautifully filmed and well-acted modern  gothic tale.  I highly recommend it.",4,The Prince of Darkness comes into his own,964051200,"07 20, 2000",2000,5703,"['Empty', 'mind', 'preconceived', 'ideas', 'film', 'viewing', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'worthwhile',

So I rented the Blu-ray version of the film to see if it was worth buying.DEAR. GOD.  This may very well be the worst Blu-ray transfer I have EVER seen thus far.  Even worse that the legendary Digital Noise-riddled ""Terminator 2"" Blu-Ray.  I barely got through my favorite 10 minutes of the film before I shut the whole thing off and took it back.  The transfer is an UGLY washed out, aged-looking, and GRAINY-AS-ALL-GET-OUT P.O.S. and it's the only digital-age disc I've actually felt CHEATED on (even early-era DVDs had sharper advantages over video...plus you knew better re-releases would follow when DVD technology picked up, but at this point in technology this is inexcusable).I cannot recommend a Blu-ray title LESS than this one.  For me, Blu-ray is about the VIDEO and AUDIO, not about the film itself.  Even if I think a movie sucks, I'll commend it if the Blu-ray transfer is good (I own ""Transformers"" for cryin' out loud), because that's what people want to know.

482774,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6305897786,T O'Brien,"[6, 8]","The Ninth Gate is a very good psychological thriller/horror movie with an excellent cast.  Dean Corso is a rare book dealer who hunts down and authenticates rare and antique books for clients.  A rich collector, Boris Balkan, hires Corso to hunt down two copies of a book that was supposedly co-written by Lucifer himself.  Corso embarks on a journey that takes him to Spain, Portugal, and France in order to find the other two copies of &quot;The Ninth Gate.&quot;  Almost immediately, Corso begins to notice strange things happening all around him once he takes possession of Balkan's copy.  This was a very enjoyable movie that was billed as your typical horror movie, but is really anything but that.  The movie is beautifully shot with plenty of Gothic themed settings.  The ending of the movie is up for your own interpretation so I won't go into what I thought.  For a very good movie that keeps you guessing throughout, check out The Ninth Gate.Johnny Depp is very good as Dean Corso, the rare book dealer who is only interested in himself and how much money he can earn.  Frank Langella is also very good as Boris Balkan, the rich collector who hires Corso to find the remaining two copies of The Ninth Gate.  Emmanuelle Seigner plays the Girl, a woman who mysteriously follows Corso as he travels across Europe.  The movie also stars Lena Olin, Barbara Jefford, Jack Taylor, and James Russo.  The DVD offers commentary from director Roman Polanski, a making of documentary, production stills/information, and widescreen presentation.

482782,A17B9IJ50LIEVZ,6305897786,"William A. Smith ""Polymath""","[3, 6]","I am not in general particularly fond of Roman Polanski as a directer.In The Ninth Gate, however, he accomplishes something rather special--agenuinely unnerving and haunting intellectual thriller, and one of thevery few films that treats the occult with intelligence and respect.Inevitably, the comparison to Rosemary's Baby has to be made. Let'sstart with the source material. Ira Levin's novel is a well-madepot-boiler; Arturo Perez-Reverte's The Club Dumas, on which The NinthGate is based (the novel is quite different in certain respects) is afirst-rate intellectual thriller, and, frankly, a much superior novel.Rosemary's Baby is more a nightmare of a really, really bad pregnancythan a supernatural film. In addition, it stars two of the mostannoying fingernails-on-the-blackboard actresses imaginable--RuthGordon and Mia Farrow. It's a chick flick with pretensions.The Ninth Gate is superior in every way. Superficially, it's adetective story with occult content and a Faustian subplot. But howmany films deal with the world of rare books-accurately? This film doesnot insult the viewer's intelligence.The script is well written and literate. Boris Balkan, a book collectorobsessed with rare books about the devil, commissions rare book dealerGregory Corso with an unusual task. Balkan has just obtained one ofthree copies extant of ""The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows""--abook printed in 1666 and purportedly based on an actual text by thedevil himself. (The author was burned at the stake for heresy). Balkanwants to verify the authenticity of his copy by comparing it with theother two. This quest becomes more and more perilous as it becomesevident that some sort of singular significance attachs to variationsbetween the three copies in the nine engravings. Balkan attempts to usethe nine engravings to summon Lucifer--and fails. But there issomething about the ninth engraving.....The casting is just about perfect--the only actor who somewhat fallsbelow the mark is Emmanuelle Seigner as The Girl--manifestly Satan'sminion in this demonic Pilgrim's Progress. A former model, Ms. Seigneris beautiful--but boring. Apparently Polanski directed her to play therole flat--but except for the occasional special effect with her eyes,we really do not feel a demonic presence. Fail of direction, oractress? Probably a bit of both. Johnny Depp does a notable job asGregory Corso, a book dealer without a conscience; Lena Olin doesanother turn on her standard over-sexed villain persona as LianaTelfer; Frank Langella is appropriately menacing as Boris Balkan, anarrogant book collector who longs for union with Satan.What makes this film work so well is that overused term atmosphere.There are few films indeed where atmosphere plays so important arole--a just comparison is to another notable supernatural film, one ofthe very few really frightening ghost stories on film--Robert Wise'sThe Haunting. In The Ninth Gate, as in The Haunting, the surroundingare critical characters. Corso, Balkan, and other inhabit spaces thatare frequently strangely empty of other living beings. The barriersbetween the world we know and a numinous world of seductive promise andevil threaten to dissolve at any moment. This is a genuinely beautifulfilm--beautiful to look at and to listen to (the score is also firstrate)--beautiful, seductive, and menacing.Many commentators has disliked the ending--and yet it is the onlypossible one. Corso, having obtained (or has he?) the secret of TheNinth Gate, enters the castle shown in the final engraving, which thendissolves into yellow light. Apotheosis? Transcendence? Damnation?Impossible to say. Anything more definite would be a disappointment.The ending is chilling--in the best way.This is not a film for the literal-minded. There are few comparablefilms--The Devil Rides Out, for one, and perhaps Dead of Night. I doubtif Polanski has ever done anything better--and the The Ninth Gate isone of the very few films about the supernatural that does not insultthe intelligence.

Maybe it could be an apolyptic movie, but it's too secular. Instead, it's what Depp seems to do well: interesting, even exciting, but not very well defined.The plot is straightforward enough: the Mystic Book is out  there, and Depp is tracking it down. He is stalked by agents unknown, death and destruction follow in his path, and I won't spoil the end (not that there are too many credible endings to choose from).This isn't an effects-fest, but Depp holds my interest anyway. He's a lot more believable than most action heroes. For example, his character spends most of his time in libraries, so he's not a physically impressive specimen. Happy to say, he is never called on for feats of superhuman strength. He barely knows which end of a gun to point where - sure enough, his first attempt to act threatening with one fails comically.The one false note was that Depp was always smoking and drinking around the precious books.

Noshie,"[5, 11]","Excellent debutThe movie starts with a book collector writing a note (which we will never know its content) gets up and hangs himself.The movie continues when a book dealer is hired by a rich book collector, to authenticate a personal copy of a rare occult ancient text, rumored to open the gates of hell, saying that only 3 copies have survived through out the years. The dealer must travel to Europe, examine the other 2 copies and retrieve or verify which is the real version. (the investigated copy was originally owned by the collector who hanged himself in the beginning of this movie)The dealer, worried someone stealing the valuable book, puts it in a safe place at a book shop. The next day, the owner of the book shop is dead (and we will never know why or who killed him).The dealer goes to Europe, examines the books and the owners end up dying as well and their books burned. (again we will not know why)Finally the employer of the dealer burns himself and die as well. (I am not sure why either)I believe the producer needed 5 hours to complete the full script in this movie.

I bet you're wondering why I only gave it three stars if it was so great. Well, it really was great.  There some were strengths and  weaknesses.  Let me explain.To begin with, The Ninth Gate had  its strengths.  1. It had a very original and creative plot.  2. Fun,  entertaining, and suspensfull.  3. just flat out GREAT!and thrillingIn addition to The Ninth Gate's strengths, there were weaknesses.  1. Not  a concluding ending.  2. A character's role was unexplained.  3. Did not  xplain how the ninth page was missing.Well, from these 6  descriptions, it may not explain what you wanted to know or find out.  But  there is a good way to find out what I am talking about.  Maybe.....See the  movie!  I hope that this review was of some help to you or inspired you to  see the film.

482790,AFVC03JNPWNPP,6305897786,"""youngvelvet""","[67, 78]",The Ninth Gate is a great film and one of Roman Polanski's most underrated films. Twenty years from now people will give this film the respect it deserves and hail it to be the great film that it is.Fist of all The Ninth Gate is not an action film. It's a slow-paced psychological thriller very similar in tone and style to Polanski's earlier films Chinatown and Frantic. Johnny Depp and Frank Langella both give great performances. Darius Khondji's photography is amazing and it has an even more amazing score by Kilar. The majority of the film was shot on location and is like a guided tour through Europe.Ignore the negative reviews and comments from people who've been brainwashed and blinded by the current Hollywood fast-food style of film making with the intention of only appealing to the lowest common denominator. A review doesn't make a good film better or a bad film worse. A superb film.

I read the book too, and yes, the movie does not do justice to the book, nevertheless I found the movie to be entertaining. Johnny Depp is famous for playing understated roles, and here he plays the ruthless book dealer Corso with a measure of indifference, and yet, his character sucks you into the plot as he ventures deeper into a web of deceit & evil. Frank Langella's Boris Balkan is intellectual and possessed of a greed for forbidden things. Lena Olin as the 'grieving widow' with devilish designs is sexy as always, but nothing more. I found the character of the 'guardian angel' who is always getting Depp out of trouble [played by Polanski's wife Emmanuelle Seigner] to be the most intriguing...her glances and looks [esp those eyes] hint at something more sinister underlying the surface.The score is haunting...one gets the feeling there are malevolent forces at work, and permeable evil throughout the movie. Although some reviews found the movie to be plodding, I didn't...if you are a serious book collector as I am, then you will be able to understand the thrill of the hunt, oftentimes very ardous and slow as you search for that one elusive title...so here Corso's quest in tracking down the other two copies of the Nine Kingdoms & unearthing their secrets...only his quest takes him into a dark, forbidding world filled with devil worshippers, and a stranger who holds the real key to all his questions.",4,"Of books, bibliophiles, and the devil!",1175990400,"04 8, 2007",2007,1519,"['Even', 'movie', 'received', 'fair', 'share', 'scathing', 'reviews', 'must', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'read', 'book', 'too', 'yes', 'movie', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'book', 'nevertheless', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'entertaining', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'famous', 'playing', 'understated', 'roles', 'here', 'ruthless', 'book', 'dealer', 'Corso', 'measure', 'indifference', 'yet', 'character', 'plot', 'ventures', 'web', 'deceit', 'evil', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'Boris', 'Balkan', 'intellectual', 'possessed', 'greed', 'forbidden', 'things', 'Lena', 'Olin', ""'grieving"", 'widow', 'devilish', 'designs', 'sexy', 'always', 'nothing', 'more', 'found', 'character', ""'guardian"", 'angel', 'who', 'always', 'getting', 'Depp', 'trouble', '[', 'played', 'Polanski', 'wife', 'Emmanuelle', 'Seigner', ']', 'be', 'most', 'intriguing', 'glances', '[', 'esp', 'eyes', ']', 'hint', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'underlying', 'surface.The', 'score', 'haunting', 'one', 'feeling', 'are', 'malevolent', 'forces', 'work', 'permeable', 'evil', 'movie', 'reviews', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'plodding', 'did', ""n't"", 'are', 'serious', 'book', 'collector', 'am', 'then', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'thrill', 'hunt', 'oftentimes', 'very', 'ardous', 'slow', 'search', 'one', 'elusive', 'title', 'so', 'here', 'Corso', 'quest', 'tracking', 'down', 'other', 'two', 'copies', 'Nine', 'Kingdoms', 'unearthing', 'secrets', 'only', 'quest', 'dark', 'forbidding', 'world', 'filled', 'devil', 'worshippers', 'stranger', 'who', 'real', 'key', 'questions']",The Ninth Gate
