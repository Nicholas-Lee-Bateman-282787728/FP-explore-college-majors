216139,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300215482,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","This silent film was the first to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. Director William Wellman was a member of the Lafayette Escadrille in the Great War. This picture is dedicated to those airmen. This film begins in a small town where Jack Powell lives. Mary Preston is the girl next door. Jack works on his automobile to make it go faster. [No safety regulations.] There is romantic rivalry. The war came and Jack answered the call for aviators. [No hats then?] Will a picture in a locket bring good luck to Jack? David says farewell to his parents and takes a toy from childhood. The future aviators undergo training in a spinning machine. Boxing instruction provides rough humor about sports. Will Mary join the Women's Motor Corps?Jack and David carry a charm for good luck. Cadet White never does. What happened? Their training begins. Then its time for the Dawn Patrol. Will they meet the 'Flying Circus'? They fly in a V formation. Combat begins at 10,000 feet [the limit for man and machine]. Both sides get victories. Two planes collide. A lack of experience made novices vulnerable. Jack lands his crippled biplane safely. Later the German Gotha bomber takes off to bomb a target escorted by two fighters. Pilots are sent to intercept this bomber. ""Where's everybody?"" Bombs destroy houses in Mervale. David shoots down one Fokker, Jack attacks the bomber from below.After America enters the war the plan is for a ""Big Push"" to win the war. The AEF needs a maximum number of planes and pilots. David and Jack are called to the squadron. Mary finds Jack and tells him of the recall. But Jack is quite drunk. Mary tries a new tactic, and it works. [Does this scene run on too long?] Fate enters the room. Does Dave get a premonition? An argument reveals Jack's feelings for Mary. Did David forget his toy? A German balloon reports on troop movements. Dave shoots down two German planes, but is attacked by two others. The balloonists parachute to safety after Jack destroys their balloons. Dave is shot down over German territory, but survives. [No parachutes for fighter pilots, then.]The squadrons are sent up to take part in the attack. The doughboys attack in force, the tanks lead the way. Will Dave make a daring escape? The Germans retreat from the attack. It is an Allied victory. ""C'est la guerre."" The war ends and Jack returns a hero. A gold star is in Dave's parent's window. Jack returns Dave's toy. Will Jack and Mary live happily ever after?This 1927 silent film is still a great drama. The battle scenes were very impressive. Around that time military thinking believed that a fleet of bombers would win any war. This was not based on any experience. Was this film designed to argue against that theory. [The Battle of Britain proved that fighters could neutralize a fleet of bombers.]",5,The War in the Clouds,1244505600,"06 9, 2009",2009,2813,"['silent', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Director', 'William', 'Wellman', 'was', 'member', 'Lafayette', 'Escadrille', 'Great', 'War', 'picture', 'dedicated', 'airmen', 'film', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'Jack', 'Powell', 'Mary', 'Preston', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'Jack', 'automobile', 'make', 'go', 'faster', '[', 'safety', 'regulations', ']', 'romantic', 'rivalry', 'war', 'came', 'Jack', 'answered', 'call', 'aviators', '[', 'hats', 'then', ']', 'Will', 'picture', 'locket', 'bring', 'good', 'luck', 'Jack', 'David', 'farewell', 'parents', 'toy', 'childhood', 'future', 'aviators', 'undergo', 'training', 'spinning', 'machine', 'Boxing', 'instruction', 'rough', 'humor', 'sports', 'Will', 'Mary', 'join', 'Women', 'Motor', 'Corps', 'Jack', 'David', 'carry', 'charm', 'good', 'luck', 'Cadet', 'White', 'never', 'What', 'happened', 'training', 'begins', 'Then', 'time', 'Dawn', 'Patrol', 'Will', 'meet', ""'Flying"", 'Circus', 'fly', 'V', 'formation', 'Combat', '10,000', 'feet', '[', 'limit', 'man', 'machine', ']', 'sides', 'get', 'victories', 'Two', 'planes', 'collide', 'lack', 'experience', 'made', 'novices', 'vulnerable', 'Jack', 'crippled', 'biplane', 'safely', 'Later', 'German', 'Gotha', 'bomber', 'bomb', 'target', 'escorted', 'two', 'fighters', 'Pilots', 'are', 'sent', 'intercept', 'bomber', 'Where', 'everybody', 'Bombs', 'destroy', 'houses', 'Mervale', 'David', 'shoots', 'down', 'one', 'Fokker', 'Jack', 'bomber', 'below.After', 'America', 'war', 'plan', 'Big', 'Push', 'win', 'war', 'AEF', 'maximum', 'number', 'planes', 'pilots', 'David', 'Jack', 'are', 'called', 'squadron', 'Mary', 'Jack', 'recall', 'Jack', 'quite', 'drunk', 'Mary', 'new', 'tactic', '[', 'scene', 'run', 'too', 'long', ']', 'Fate', 'room', 'Does', 'Dave', 'get', 'premonition', 'argument', 'Jack', 'feelings', 'Mary', 'Did', 'David', 'forget', 'toy', 'German', 'balloon', 'reports', 'troop', 'movements', 'Dave', 'shoots', 'down', 'two', 'German', 'planes', 'attacked', 'two', 'others', 'balloonists', 'parachute', 'safety', 'Jack', 'balloons', 'Dave', 'shot', 'down', 'German', 'territory', '[', 'parachutes', 'fighter', 'pilots', 'then', ']', 'squadrons', 'are', 'sent', 'up', 'take', 'part', 'attack', 'doughboys', 'attack', 'force', 'tanks', 'lead', 'way', 'Will', 'Dave', 'make', 'daring', 'escape', 'Germans', 'retreat', 'attack', 'Allied', 'victory', ""C'est"", 'la', 'guerre', 'war', 'Jack', 'hero', 'A', 'gold', 'star', 'Dave', 'parent', 'window', 'Jack', 'Dave', 'toy', 'Will', 'Jack', 'Mary', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', '1927', 'silent', 'film', 'still', 'great', 'drama', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'impressive', 'time', 'military', 'thinking', 'believed', 'fleet', 'bombers', 'would', 'win', 'war', 'was', 'not', 'based', 'experience', 'Was', 'film', 'designed', 'argue', 'theory', '[', 'Battle', 'Britain', 'proved', 'fighters', 'could', 'neutralize', 'fleet', 'bombers', ']']",N/A

Gregory ""Andrew Gregory""","[1, 1]","Wings, the first and last motion picture to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, is as entertaining and powerful today as it certainly was in 1927. The latest release--in Blu-ray--surpasses any previous versions. Visually, the picture is as clear, sharp, and pristine as it was when it played the road show circuit in its first year of release. The Blu-ray version included the full symphonic score that was created for the original theatrical release, plus the sound effects that were created behind the screen during its original showings. Buddy Rogers and Richard Arlen carry the story well in every scene, but the finest performance of all is that of Clara Bow. Miss Bow creates a fine sense of humor to most of her scenes, plus tears in others. As popular as she was, Bow was misused and woefully underrated by Paramount. In &#34;Wings&#34; Miss Bow demonstrates a screen presence like no other performer of the silent era.People who think they don't like silent motion pictures or black and white pictures will be won over by this title.

216148,A37021SSH9LGY6,6300215482,Barbara J. Wertz,"[4, 4]","Paramount took quite a bit of time to bring WINGS to DVD, but it was well worth the wait.  It's a joy to see this landmark film as it was meant to be seen and heard.I say ""heard"" because silent films were rarely seen in silence.  Large theaters in cities had full orchestras to play either a composed or compiled score for a major film like WINGS.  Slightly smaller theaters would have a theater pipe organ.  A theater organ is a very different thing from a church organ and is capable of some very realistic sound effects.  Neighborhood theaters would have either a piano or a reed organ and the accompanist might make up a score as he/she went along using a personal repertoire of musical motifs appropriate to the action.  Thus the experience of seeing any silent film varied depending on the music that was supplied.  This DVD release offers both an orchestral and an organ score.  Both are excellent.  Watch them both and you'll notice the difference.Clara Bow has top billing in WINGS even though her character is barely necessary to the plot.  She was Paramount's biggest star at the time and WINGS was their ""big picture"" for 1927.  Nonetheless, she brings real charm to the role and her scenes are memorable.  The Motion Picture Production Code was not yet a fact of life and Bow fans watching closely could catch a glimpse of her topless.  Of course no one in 1927 could foresee the day when the pause button on a DVD player would allow viewers to appreciate Ms Bow's beauty at leisure.Charles ""Buddy"" Rogers and Richard Arlen are the male stars who carry most of the plot.  Though both of them were fine actors, neither of them had previously starred in a big-budget film and neither would again.  And then there's the bit part played by a promising young actor by the name of Gary Cooper.  He has barely more than a minute of screen time, but it's a star-is-born minute.The real stars of WINGS are the planes.  Director William Wellman and writer John Monk Saunders had been pilots in World War I and brought both their wartime experience and love of planes to the film.  And they couldn't have done it without the help of the US Army.  (There was no separate air force in those days.)  Much of the location shooting was done in the vicinity of Fort Sam Houston and Kelly Field in Texas, and the battlefield for infantry fighting was constructed on adjoining land.  Army pilots flew in most of the combat sequences, though Hollywood stunt pilots did the crack-ups.  And they did crack up a lot of planes.  These weren't miniature models as had been used in previous air combat films, rear-projection effects as would have been used in lower budget films or CGI effects as would be used today.  They were real pilots crashing real planes at great risk to life and limb, to say nothing of great expense.Even the stars flew combat scenes.  Arlen had served in the Royal Canadian Flying Corps, though he hadn't seen combat.  Rogers learned to fly, though he got terribly airsick.  Cinematographer Harry Perry hit upon the idea of attaching motorized cameras (most cameras in those days were hand-cranked) to the fuselages of the planes so that the pilots could be filmed with the sky or ground behind them.  So, in many scenes, the actors are flying the planes, running the cameras and acting all at the same time.  The result is fabulous.  WINGS deserved its Oscar for Best Production as the Best Picture category was known in 1928. It also received the award for Engineering as special effects were called in those days.For WWI plane buffs there's even a Gotha bomber, the ultimate weapon of the day.  Several shots both on the ground and in the air give a feel for the size of the Gotha as compared to the one-engine planes of the period.  Even seeing a Gotha in a museum can't match that.In reading some reviews on Amazon I notice that some people have trouble getting comfortable with older films and particularly with silents.  Please try to accept these films as the slightly different art form that they are, much as an opera is different from a play.  They should not be colorized (though color tinting and detail painting is completely appropriate) and they should not have dialogue sound tracks grafted onto them.  They have a poetry of their own.  If one can't accept that then don't watch them, but don't suggest that they be butchered to fit modern tastes.One thing that even people who love silents often don't realize is that the original aspect ratio of these films is practically square, something in the range of 1.15:1.  Over the decades these films were copied and recopied onto film stock with more rectangular ratios and we had to accept that as the price of seeing these great old films.  But now many of the studios are releasing these films on DVD in their original aspect ratios.  Sometimes, depending on the make of your equipment, this might require adjusting the aspect ratio of either your DVD player or your TV.  Whether your screen has a 4:3 or a 16:9 aspect ratio you should have black bars on both sides of the picture, which should be almost square, in order to see it without distortion.",5,A landmark of

Ace William ""Wild Bill"" Wellman helmed this great silent about two young men who can't wait to fly through the skies and the Great War which gives them their chance to live their romantic dreams.Wellman's filming of combat in the clouds is still as fresh and exciting as it was when it won the first Academy Award for Best Picture. Sometimes lost, however, when historians talk of this film, is the sweet and innocent romance which frames the film.Clara Bow shines with great energy and charisma as the young sweet Mary Preston. Her ""girl next door"" portrayel of an American girl longing for the love of Jack Powell (Charles ""Buddy"" Rogers) is endearing. Another often forgotten element is the performance of Jobyna Ralston as the lovely rich girl, Sylvia, both Jack and David Armstrong (Richard Arlen) are in love with.Under Wellman's direction, her Sylvia has a tenderness and likability, rather than just the ""rich girl standing in the way"" she might have been in another film. Bow is lively, cute and sexy, but Ralston's Sylvia has some romantically framed scenes which helps her hold her own.For the most part, however, Wellman's film is about males and the bonds often formed during wartime. These flyers are not jaded yet, as in Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" and it is that romantic innocence which makes this an engrossing and sentimental masterpiece of a bygone era.Mary will join the Women's Motor Core and cross paths with her true love. David and Jack will become closer than brothers, one making the ultimate sacrifice and allowing his friend to go on with his life free of guilt. It is the story which is the star here, rather than the actors. Gary Cooper does, however, exude star power in his brief time as the veteren flyer welcoming the two new recruits with a sobering reminder of war.Wellman's famous scenes of open-air planes soaring into battle like graceful wings carrying danger and death are unforgettable. The fact that the two actors actually flew their own planes as this breathtaking footage was shot is astounding. The battles are real and deadly, Wellman showing there was honor in the skies as well as danger.Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of director Wellman here is despite the tragedy and danger clearly shown, he still manages to convey the more romantic aspects of war, or at the very least the romantic notions of it. One of the great films of the silent era, ""Wings"" does not disappoint. An entertaining film which stands on its own, it is also an historical bridge between an innocence which was soon to pass into those cloud filled skies and never return.",5,Romance and Danger in the Skies,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,2711,"['silent', 'film', 'aged', 'well', 'soars', 'skies', 'two', 'hours', 'action', 'romantic', 'drama', 'Ace', 'William', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Wellman', 'helmed', 'great', 'silent', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'fly', 'skies', 'Great', 'War', 'chance', 'live', 'romantic', 'dreams.Wellman', 'filming', 'combat', 'clouds', 'still', 'fresh', 'exciting', 'was', 'when', 'won', 'first', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Sometimes', 'lost', 'however', 'when', 'historians', 'talk', 'film', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'romance', 'film.Clara', 'Bow', 'great', 'energy', 'charisma', 'young', 'sweet', 'Mary', 'Preston', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'portrayel', 'American', 'girl', 'longing', 'love', 'Jack', 'Powell', 'Charles', 'Buddy', 'Rogers', 'endearing', 'often', 'forgotten', 'element', 'performance', 'Jobyna', 'Ralston', 'lovely', 'rich', 'girl', 'Sylvia', 'Jack', 'David', 'Armstrong', 'Richard', 'Arlen', 'are', 'love', 'with.Under', 'Wellman', 'direction', 'Sylvia', 'tenderness', 'likability', 'rather', 'just', 'rich', 'girl', 'standing', 'way', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'Bow', 'lively', 'cute', 'sexy', 'Ralston', 'Sylvia', 'romantically', 'framed', 'scenes', 'hold', 'own.For', 'most', 'part', 'however', 'Wellman', 'film', 'males', 'bonds', 'often', 'formed', 'wartime', 'flyers', 'are', 'not', 'jaded', 'yet', 'Hawks', 'Only', 'Angels', 'Have', 'Wings', 'romantic', 'innocence', 'engrossing', 'sentimental', 'masterpiece', 'bygone', 'era.Mary', 'will', 'join', 'Women', 'Motor', 'Core', 'cross', 'paths', 'true', 'love', 'David', 'Jack', 'will', 'become', 'closer', 'brothers', 'one', 'making', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'allowing', 'friend', 'go', 'life', 'free', 'guilt', 'story', 'star', 'here', 'rather', 'actors', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'however', 'exude', 'star', 'power', 'brief', 'time', 'veteren', 'flyer', 'welcoming', 'two', 'new', 'recruits', 'sobering', 'reminder', 'war.Wellman', 'famous', 'scenes', 'open-air', 'planes', 'soaring', 'battle', 'graceful', 'wings', 'carrying', 'danger', 'death', 'are', 'unforgettable', 'fact', 'two', 'actors', 'actually', 'flew', 'own', 'planes', 'breathtaking', 'footage', 'was', 'shot', 'astounding', 'battles', 'are', 'real', 'deadly', 'Wellman', 'showing', 'there', 'was', 'honor', 'skies', 'as', 'well', 'danger.Perhaps', 'greatest', 'accomplishment', 'director', 'Wellman', 'here', 'tragedy', 'danger', 'clearly', 'shown', 'still', 'convey', 'more', 'romantic', 'aspects', 'war', 'very', 'least', 'romantic', 'notions', 'One', 'great', 'films', 'silent', 'era', 'Wings', 'not', 'disappoint', 'entertaining', 'film', 'own', 'also', 'historical', 'bridge', 'innocence', 'was', 'soon', 'pass', 'cloud', 'filled', 'skies', 'never', 'return']",N/A

216158,A3M5UGU0NGD38D,6300215482,Casey62,"[13, 14]","In 1927 airplanes were big news. Charles Lindbergh made the first non-stop transatlantic flight and Paramount Studios released one of the last, great silent films, WINGS. The unprecedented production of this film epitomized the daredevil spirit of the '20's just as much as did Lindbergh's historic flight. It won the first Academy Award for Best Picture, and its thrilling aerial scenes remain among the finest ever filmed.WINGS tells the story of two WW1 flying buddies (Buddy Rogers, Richard Arlen) and the girls they love (Clara Bow, Jobyna Ralston). This premise serves as the backdrop for the breathtaking sequences that take place on the battlefield and in the sky. While the story is necessarily simple, it's acted out with touching sensitivity so that we're easily moved by all the characters. The radiant Clara Bow is particularly good as the long suffering ambulance driver. Soon to be star Gary Cooper has a brief but memorable scene as a cadet.To those of us who watch a lot of silents, the greatness of WINGS comes as no surprise. Filmmaking in that era was pretty gutsy stuff. CGI was unheard of, and rear projection - or process photography - was still experimental. Often times the only way to get certain shots of a spectacular nature was to film the actual event - no faking it. WINGS was expertly directed by William ""Wild Bill"" Wellman who was himself a WW1 pilot, and whose crew consisted of professional stunt fliers who really took those planes to the heights we see in the film. Even leading stars Buddy Rogers and Richard Arlen had to fly their own planes for many of their scenes.Paramount's Blu-ray of WINGS is jaw dropping - the image clarity leaps from the screen. We must be very close to what audiences saw in 1927. There's two soundtracks: the original, re-recorded score by S. J. Zamecnik with sound effects, and an organ score by Gaylord Carter. I prefer the Zamecnik/sound effects track because it enhances the entire viewing experience. The special features are all excellent: A documentary that raises appreciation for the enormous effort that went into its making; also one on how it was painstakingly restored; and a segment on WW1 dogfighting tactics.This is without question a five star release that fulfills any classic film lover's highest expectations.",5,A SILENT CLASSIC SOARS TO NEW HEIGHTS IN HD,1327536000,"01 26, 2012",2012,2297,"['1927', 'airplanes', 'were', 'big', 'news', 'Charles', 'Lindbergh', 'made', 'first', 'non-stop', 'transatlantic', 'flight', 'Paramount', 'Studios', 'released', 'one', 'last', 'great', 'silent', 'films', 'WINGS', 'unprecedented', 'production', 'film', 'epitomized', 'daredevil', 'spirit', ""'20"", 'just', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'Lindbergh', 'historic', 'flight', 'won', 'first', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'thrilling', 'aerial', 'scenes', 'remain', 'finest', 'ever', 'filmed.WINGS', 'story', 'two', 'WW1', 'flying', 'buddies', 'Buddy', 'Rogers', 'Richard', 'Arlen', 'girls', 'love', 'Clara', 'Bow', 'Jobyna', 'Ralston', 'premise', 'backdrop', 'breathtaking', 'take', 'place', 'battlefield', 'sky', 'story', 'necessarily', 'simple', 'acted', 'out', 'touching', 'sensitivity', 'so', ""'re"", 'easily', 'moved', 'characters', 'radiant', 'Clara', 'Bow', 'particularly', 'good', 'long', 'suffering', 'ambulance', 'driver', 'Soon', 'be', 'star', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'brief', 'memorable', 'scene', 'cadet.To', 'who', 'watch', 'lot', 'silents', 'greatness', 'WINGS', 'surprise', 'Filmmaking', 'era', 'was', 'pretty', 'gutsy', 'stuff', 'CGI', 'was', 'unheard', 'rear', 'projection', 'process', 'photography', 'was', 'still', 'experimental', 'Often', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'certain', 'shots', 'spectacular', 'nature', 'was', 'film', 'actual', 'event', 'faking', 'WINGS', 'was', 'expertly', 'directed', 'William', 'Wild', 'Bill', 'Wellman', 'who', 'was', 'WW1', 'pilot', 'crew', 'consisted', 'professional', 'stunt', 'fliers', 'who', 'really', 'took', 'planes', 'heights', 'see', 'film', 'Even', 'leading', 'stars', 'Buddy', 'Rogers', 'Richard', 'Arlen', 'had', 'fly', 'own', 'planes', 'many', 'scenes.Paramount', 'Blu-ray', 'WINGS', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'image', 'clarity', 'screen', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'close', 'what', 'audiences', 'saw', '1927', 'two', 'soundtracks', 'original', 're-recorded', 'score', 'S.', 'J.', 'Zamecnik', 'sound', 'effects', 'organ', 'score', 'Gaylord', 'Carter', 'prefer', 'Zamecnik/sound', 'effects', 'track', 'entire', 'viewing', 'experience', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'appreciation', 'enormous', 'effort', 'went', 'making', 'also', 'one', 'how', 'was', 'painstakingly', 'restored', 'segment', 'WW1', 'dogfighting', 'tactics.This', 'question', 'five', 'star', 'release', 'classic', 'film', 'lover', 'highest', 'expectations']",N/A

It also marks the apex of the careers of its three stars: Clara Bow, Charles ""Buddy"" Rogers, and Richard Arlen. Buddy Rogers would later marry Mary Pickford and concentrate on Big Band music while Clara Bow made only a few sound films before retiring in 1933 at the age of 28. Richard Arlen stayed in movies a bit longer but is best remembered today as the hero of 1932's THE ISLAND OF LOST SOULS with Charles Laughton. The director William Wellman would go on to quite a distinguished career making such films as THE PUBLIC ENEMY with James Cagney, the 1937 A STAR IS BORN and 1943's THE OX-BOW INCIDENT. He made his last film, LAFAYETTE ESCADRILLE, in 1958.Wellman had actually flown planes during the Great War and so he wanted to make sure that this film captured what it was like to fly and to engage in combat up in the skies. One of the film's great strengths is the outstanding aerial photography which Howard Hughes would copy for HELL'S ANGELS three years later. Another strength is the story itself. While basically one of the first buddy films, WINGS manages not only to capture the horrors of war but the innocence of pre-WWI America as personified by the three main characters. Clara Bow gives a remarkable performance showing that she was more than just a 1920's sex symbol when given a good script and placed in the hands of a capable director like Wellman. By the time the film is over you long for its beginning. The final scenes are among the most moving in all of silent film with an ending that you have waited the whole movie for.After years of bootleg copies from Asia simply transferring the old VHS edition to DVD, Paramount is finally giving WINGS the quality restoration it deserves. Available on both Blu-Ray and DVD, the release will include the film's original orchestral score in a new recording, the old Gaylord Carter organ score from the VHS copy, color tints like those used in 1927, and period sound effects. This is scheduled to be the first of several restorations by Paramount of a number of the studio's legendary films to coincide with the company's 100th anniversary in 2012.POST SCRIPT: With THE ARTIST winning Best Picture this year, that marks 84 years since a silent film has had that honor.",5,And The First Best Picture Oscar...,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,2357,"['WINGS', 'was', 'back', '1927', 'one', 'great', 'anti-war', 'films', 'even', 'war', 'World', 'War', 'also', 'apex', 'careers', 'three', 'stars', 'Clara', 'Bow', 'Charles', 'Buddy', 'Rogers', 'Richard', 'Arlen', 'Buddy', 'Rogers', 'would', 'later', 'marry', 'Mary', 'Pickford', 'concentrate', 'Big', 'Band', 'music', 'Clara', 'Bow', 'made', 'only', 'few', 'sound', 'films', 'retiring', '1933', 'age', '28', 'Richard', 'Arlen', 'stayed', 'movies', 'bit', 'longer', 'best', 'remembered', 'today', 'hero', '1932', 'THE', 'ISLAND', 'OF', 'LOST', 'SOULS', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'director', 'William', 'Wellman', 'would', 'go', 'quite', 'distinguished', 'career', 'making', 'such', 'films', 'THE', 'PUBLIC', 'ENEMY', 'James', 'Cagney', '1937', 'A', 'STAR', 'IS', 'BORN', '1943', 'OX-BOW', 'INCIDENT', 'made', 'last', 'film', 'LAFAYETTE', 'ESCADRILLE', '1958.Wellman', 'had', 'actually', 'flown', 'planes', 'Great', 'War', 'so', 'wanted', 'make', 'sure', 'film', 'captured', 'what', 'was', 'fly', 'engage', 'combat', 'up', 'skies', 'One', 'film', 'great', 'strengths', 'outstanding', 'aerial', 'photography', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'would', 'copy', 'HELL', 'ANGELS', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'strength', 'story', 'basically', 'one', 'first', 'buddy', 'films', 'WINGS', 'not', 'only', 'capture', 'horrors', 'war', 'innocence', 'pre-WWI', 'America', 'personified', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Clara', 'Bow', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'showing', 'was', 'more', 'just', '1920', 'sex', 'symbol', 'when', 'given', 'good', 'script', 'placed', 'hands', 'capable', 'director', 'Wellman', 'time', 'film', 'long', 'beginning', 'final', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'moving', 'silent', 'film', 'ending', 'have', 'waited', 'whole', 'movie', 'for.After', 'years', 'bootleg', 'copies', 'Asia', 'simply', 'transferring', 'old', 'VHS', 'edition', 'DVD', 'Paramount', 'finally', 'giving', 'WINGS', 'quality', 'restoration', 'Available', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'release', 'will', 'include', 'film', 'original', 'orchestral', 'score', 'new', 'recording', 'old', 'Gaylord', 'Carter', 'organ', 'score', 'VHS', 'copy', 'color', 'tints', 'used', '1927', 'period', 'sound', 'effects', 'scheduled', 'be', 'first', 'several', 'restorations', 'Paramount', 'number', 'studio', 'legendary', 'films', 'coincide', 'company', '100th', 'anniversary', '2012.POST', 'SCRIPT', 'THE', 'ARTIST', 'winning', 'Best', 'Picture', 'year', '84', 'years', 'silent', 'film', 'had', 'honor']",N/A

216165,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6300215482,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 5]","As a silent film fan, you tend to accept that a lot of films are lost and those that are not lost, you tend to expect smaller companies releasing them on Blu-ray or DVD.For many years now, there have been three silent films, epics, that I have been awaiting for a DVD video release for a long time.  The three films are Erich von Stroheim's ""Greed"" (1924), King Vidor's ""The Big Parade"" (1925) and William A. Wellman's 1927 film ""Wings"".And I have to admit that I have felt that the studio have been dangling a carrot for silent film fans, teasing us over the years, watching a once in awhile airing on TCM and yet, not knowing when these films will ever see a video release at all.That changed in 2012 as ""Wings"", known as the first Academy Award winning film for ""Best Picture"" (at the time known as ""Most Outstanding Production"") would receive it's HD treatment with a Blu-ray release and also on DVD, after receiving extensive restoration.And not only does William A. Wellman's (known for directing ""The Public Enemy"", ""A Star is Born"", ""The Ox-Bow Incident"") masterpiece look absolutely fantastic in 1080p High Definition, the inclusion of a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack with sound effects literally surprised me, as I was not expecting it.And this is quite interesting as the film was once considered lost until a print was found at the Cinematheque Francaise film archive in Paris, in which the deteriorating nitrate film was transferred to safety film stock, and was re-released in theaters.In 1997, ""Wings"" was selected for preservation in the United Stats National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".""Wings"" is based on the story by John Monk Saunders and the screenplay adaptation was written by Hope Loring and Louis D. Lighton.VIDEO:When it comes to silent films on Blu-ray, I'm not very picky as many silent films have suffered from nitrate damage and neglect.  And the fact is that many companies can't spend millions of dollars on restoration.  So, I have had this ""take what you can get"" attitude towards silent films on Blu-ray and DVD for a long time.But when ""The General"", ""Modern Times"" and ""Metropolis"" were released on Blu-ray, three films that did receive restoration, that's when I have high expectations.  With ""Wings"", it's the same situation.  I know that there was a PhotoPlay restoration done awhile back, but the version featured is a Paramount restoration.The film is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:34:1 aspect ratio), color tinted with black bars on the side.  I was absolutely pleased with the video as visually, this is best I have seen of the film, this is the best I have ever seen of Clara Bow on video and there were no nitrate damage, no warping. I didn't see any scratches or dust which was surprising.  There is no doubt that there was considerable money spent to restore this film and it shows as the film looks clean and visually, stunning!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Wings"" is presented in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (featuring a re-recorded score composed by J.S. Zamecnik (orchestrated and arranged by Domink Hauser, featuring pianist Frederick Hodges and sound effects by Ben Burtt).  There is also a Dolby Digital Stereo 2.0 soundtrack featuring a pipe organ score composed and performed by Gaylord Carter.It's one thing for the film to look amazing in HD but for those with a home theater system, when you watch and have your audio setting set to the lossless version, audiophiles, you are in for a treat. I was absolutely floored by the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless audio. The sound effects...I was not expecting to hear it. But when the LFE (subwoofer) started to rumble and started to hear audio coming from all around me through the surround channels during the aerial dogfighting sequences, my first reaction was amazement and I was shocked because I was not expecting it at all.And I can continue to gush about the lossless soundtrack, while others may not be so thrilled with sound effects and a new re-recorded score, as some absolutely love the Carl Davis score that was featured long ago.  But the expected Gaylor Carter pipe organ score was included (as many people are familiar with his score) and it also sounds good via lossless stereo.So, I'm very pleased that Paramount had decided to include two soundtracks and also really do something different by incorporating the sound effects, what a surprise and I'm impressed!Subtitles are also included in French, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES""Wings"" comes with the following special features:Wings: Grandeur in the Sky - (25:56) A featurette that goes into the making of ""Wings"", the challenges of aerial cinematography of the time and trying to make the film authentic with a $2 million budget (which was a lot at that time).  As well as looking into the success of the film.Restoring the Power and Beauty of Wings - (14:21) A featurette on the restoration of ""Wings"" including the re-recording score by J.S. Zamecnik and the sound effects by Ben BurttDogfight - (12:54) A featurette about the evolution of airplanes, especially those used in World War I.EXTRAS:""Wings"" comes with a slipcover.JUDGMENT CALL:For so many years, I have wanted this film on DVD.  What was easily available and accessible were bad versions of the film available via public domain and suffice to say, the announcement of ""Wings"" on Blu-ray was incredible.As a silent film fan, it's amazing that in these last few years, we have seen the progress of having to see silent film in HD with amazing detail and clarity but most importantly, seeing generations of movie fans taking a chance on silent cinema and enjoying them.While you have your loyal fans who will buy these videos, may they be in Blu-ray, DVD, LD, VHS or actual reels, the fact that Paramount has released ""Wings"" on Blu-ray is fantastic news because it leaves the possibility for other classic Paramount silents to be released on Blu-ray and DVD.And with ""Wings"", this is one film that has evaded video release for a long time and here we are now with the definitive version of the film to date.  The most beautiful version of the film to date and now, I must add, the re-recorded score with sound effects in lossless audio adds another dimension to this Wellman masterpiece.I certainly didn't know what to expect as I watched this film expecting better video quality but when you start hearing machine gun's firing all around you, the engines of airplanes reverberating around your room via the surround channels and hearing that LFE kick in...this is something that you never expect from a silent film.And why that makes me happy is that Paramount is reaching out to two sets of fans.  The hardcore fans who were familiar with Gaylord Carter's pipe organ score (unfortunately, Carl Davis' score was not included) but then also knowing that Blu-ray fans, especially for a silent film, you're going to have to entice them with something extra in order for them to purchase this film.  And sure enough, these fans can enjoy this silent film with a fantastic lossless track with immersive sound effects.And for the silent fans who still haven't upgraded to Blu-ray, add ""Wings"" on the list for another reason why they should upgrade!So, it's one thing to have a wonderful visual presentation and soundtrack, but what about the film?I absolutely enjoyed it as it has a good balance of drama, action and also comedy mixed in.  For Clara Bow fans, the truth is that ""It"" was a wonderful film that showcased Bow's talents but in terms of accessibility, for one of the top actresses in America, it's not easy to find films with Clara.  And ""Wings"" on Blu-ray not only shows us her emotional performance (the Blu-ray does bring out the details of the tears) but also her boundless energy.Of course, Clara Bow, while receiving top billing on the Blu-ray case, the film is primarily featuring Charles ""Buddy"" Rogers and Richard Arlen.  Although I typically dislike this modern term to describe male friendship, yes...""Wings"" is the ultimate ""Bromance"" film.  You get the camaraderie of best friends training to be pilots, knowing they are rivals but managing to get past that and become brothers, watching each other's backs.  And to see how this friendship develops towards the end of the film.Both men performed their roles magnificently and it was interesting to also be treated by a cameo featuring Gary Cooper as Cadet White, while not long at all and years before the actor became popular and would star in films such as  ""High Noon"", ""Sergeant York"", ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"", ""A Farewell to Arms"", to name a few, Cooper's cameo definitely sets things into perspective that war is ugly and death can happen anytime.  It's important to note that also that same year, for Clara Bow's ""It"", Gary Cooper had an uncredited cameo.And while the film features wonderful performances by its three talent for this film (especially this era), there is no doubt that this epic engages its viewers through its visual setting as hundreds of men are engaged in war, while above, we are taken above to the sky with actual aerial cinematography that even makes me wonder how they pulled it off back in 1927.  It did help that director William A. Wellman, writer John Monk Saunders and actor Richard Arlen served in World War I as military advisors (in fact, Arlen would teach as a United States Army Air Forces flight instructor during World War II).  While Buddy Rogers would undergo flight training to prepare him for his role.  And for the most part, the training led to the efficacy of director Wellman trying to achieve authenticity for his film.As for the Blu-ray release, as mentioned... this is the definitive version of ""Wings"" to own for now.  While I would have loved to hear an audio commentary track and see more special features included, as mentioned with my feeling towards silent films, many hardly come with special features and when they do, they are fairly short.  You get three special features that end up as around an hour worth of extra content and you take what you can get.  But it would have been nice to see an audio commentary track, perhaps lobby card and photo gallery.Overall, ""Wings"" is a magnificent Blu-ray release.  For silent fans who have wanted a reason to upgrade to Blu-ray, ""Wings"" can be added to that list for another reason why to upgrade.  A fantastic Blu-ray release that cinema and silent film fans will want to have in their collection!  It is a must-own!",5,"I have one word to describe this Blu-ray release of ""Wings"" and that is ""WOW!""",1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,10523,"['silent', 'film', 'fan', 'tend', 'accept', 'lot',

It's an outstanding achievement in filmmaking during the great era of silent pictures and ultimately speaks for itself for those who are familiar with it.But am I really the only one who is completely outraged over the fact that some modern-day 21st Century idiot at Paramount thought it would be a good idea to insert computer-generated color images of fire and flames coming from the rear of the bi-planes whenever one of them is shot down during the aerial combat sequences??  I consider this little move to be absolutely disgraceful and even disrespectful to not only a legendary film but to classic films in general.  Why must some people degrade our cinema's past by trying to make the films a little more modern and perhaps more appealing to the modern day multiplex moron who doesn't have the patience or the intelligence to appreciate silent films as they were originally created?In the 1980s, they tried to colorize black and white films.  Thankfully, that never really took off and we can probably give partial thanks to filmmakers like Woody Allen.  To take a great film like WINGS and give it a ""modern"" touch (to RAPE it would be a more accurate term!) a-la George Lucas is just WRONG, plain and simple.

216172,A1JCN10T0TPOPH,6300215482,"Esn024 ""esn024""","[8, 13]","Well, here is exactly the type of silent film that most people do not watch nowadays; it's neither a comedy like the Charlie Chaplin movies, nor a horror film like Nosferatu. This, instead, is a typical American action/drama flick, with ample quantities of both.It certainly suffers at times for being a silent film; dialogues have to be displayed on the screen, and this happens quite often because the story here is sometimes quite complex. Not only do the characters talk a lot, but the story also often requires some explaining, and some of the explanations can be quite long.The action sequences are not as &quot;big&quot; as in they would be in movies today, but they are a lot more impressive in their own way. I was just amazed at how they could have shot some of those sequences; I got the impression that the person who was shooting was probably in quite a lot of danger, because I knew that they could not have used special effects in 1927; what I was seeing was the real thing. It was quite exhilirating to see those old, unsafe, WW1 planes in the air.  I do not think that any director today would be crazy enough to duplicate something like this with real planes, so this is probably the only chance anyone has to see these planes in action, and feel like you're right in the thick of a dogfight.That having been said, the film does stretch out for a bit too long sometimes. It never really gets boring, but it never really gets particularly interesting for most of the movie either. Most of the time, it's just entertaining enough to keep you watching it.The reason I gave it a &quot;4&quot; is because the ending, when it comes, is quite good (don't let anybody spoil it for you; watch for yourself), and also because of the action sequences. The film is also quite funny in a few spots, notably in any scene with the patriotic Dutch aviator (I wish we had seen more of him), and in the Paris &quot;drunken man&quot; scene.Overall, not a bad movie, and one that I know others may like more than me; so go ahead and see it (don't forget, though; it's 131 minutes)!",4,"A bit above average, I guess.",1083888000,"05 7, 2004",2004,2079,"['Well', 'here', 'exactly', 'type', 'silent', 'film', 'most', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'nowadays', 'comedy', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'movies', 'horror', 'film', 'Nosferatu', 'instead', 'typical', 'American', 'action/drama', 'flick', 'ample', 'quantities', 'both.It', 'certainly', 'times', 'being', 'silent', 'film', 'dialogues', 'have', 'be', 'displayed', 'screen', 'quite', 'often', 'story', 'here', 'sometimes', 'quite', 'complex', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'characters', 'talk', 'lot', 'story', 'also', 'often', 'explaining', 'explanations', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'long.The', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'not', 'quot', 'big', 'quot', 'would', 'be', 'movies', 'today', 'are', 'lot', 'more', 'impressive', 'own', 'way', 'was', 'just', 'amazed', 'how', 'could', 'have', 'shot', 'sequences', 'got', 'impression', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'shooting', 'was', 'probably', 'quite', 'lot', 'danger', 'knew', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'used', 'special', 'effects', '1927', 'what', 'was', 'seeing', 'was', 'real', 'thing', 'was', 'quite', 'exhilirating', 'see', 'old', 'unsafe', 'WW1', 'planes', 'air', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'director', 'today', 'would', 'be', 'crazy', 'enough', 'duplicate', 'something', 'real', 'planes', 'probably', 'only', 'chance', 'anyone', 'see', 'planes', 'action', 'feel', ""'re"", 'right', 'thick', 'dogfight.That', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'film', 'stretch', 'out', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'sometimes', 'never', 'really', 'boring', 'never', 'really', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'most', 'movie', 'Most', 'time', 'just', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'keep', 'watching', 'it.The', 'reason', 'gave', 'quot', '4', 'quot', 'ending', 'when', 'quite', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'anybody', 'spoil', 'watch', 'also', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'funny', 'few', 'spots', 'notably', 'scene', 'patriotic', 'Dutch', 'aviator', 'wish', 'had', 'seen', 'more', 'Paris', 'quot', 'drunken', 'man', 'quot', 'scene.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'one', 'know', 'others', 'may', 'like', 'more', 'so', 'go', 'ahead', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', '131', 'minutes']",N/A

(note: this was my first ever viewing of the entire film, after seeing a clip years ago: the ""swing"" scene at the beginning. Wonderful.) Oh, one more thing: I've read that this film was done in an early version of (gasp!) widescreen, 'Magnascope'. I have a (film) book, which shows a scene from approx. 1'58""45 sec. into the film, and comparing the 2 images, find that my dvd copy has about 30% of the photograph content. Oye! The picture MAY be just a photo that is not representative of the aspect ratio, but if it IS the actual film frame, I am hoping it is still available in someone's vault (someone should check in Buenos Aires!*).

216191,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6300215482,Martin Asiner,"[9, 9]","WINGS has most of the virtues and only a few of the vices of the silent movie.  The lack of speech requires the audience to pay close attention to subtle nuances of facial expression and scene change.  Director William Wellman managed to create an impressive recreation of a war that was silent on the screen but not in the mind.  The plot, though thin, still carries the movie to the point where the real stars come in--the exciting dogfights that still resonate with visual power.  Clara Bow is the marquee star but she disappears after the first half, only to reappear minutes before the closing credits.  Charles Rogers, who bears a stunning resemblance to Robert Downey Jr., plays Jack, the object of her love, who in turn loves Sylvia, played by Jobyna Ralston.  Richard Arlen is David, who also loves Sylvia.  Mary (Bow) loves Jack (Rogers) but confusingly tells David that she loves him.  The love quadrangle becomes even more tangled when Jack effortlessly and conveniently switches affection from Sylvia to Mary.  Once, however, the viewer rolls with the numerous romantic plot twists, he can see that the aerial fight scenes form the collective real star of the film.  And beyond them lies an anti-war subtext in whose carnal viciousness prefigures the much later graphic killing fields of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  To appreciate WINGS, one must view it as contemporary audiences did.  To them, WINGS was a movie whose plot was secondary to the then state of the arts special effects.  The result was a convincing and viscerally effective film that is worth the while to view, even after nearly seventy-five years.",4,Wings: A Worthy First Best Picture Winner,1030924800,"09 2, 2002",2002,1621,"['WINGS', 'most', 'virtues', 'only', 'few', 'vices', 'silent', 'movie', 'lack', 'speech', 'audience', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'facial', 'expression', 'scene', 'change', 'Director', 'William', 'Wellman', 'managed', 'create', 'impressive', 'recreation', 'war', 'was', 'silent', 'screen', 'not', 'mind', 'plot', 'thin', 'still', 'movie', 'point', 'where', 'real', 'stars', 'come', 'exciting', 'dogfights', 'still', 'resonate', 'visual', 'power', 'Clara', 'Bow', 'marquee', 'star', 'first', 'half', 'only', 'reappear', 'minutes', 'closing', 'credits', 'Charles', 'Rogers', 'who', 'stunning', 'resemblance', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Jack', 'object', 'love', 'who', 'turn', 'loves', 'Sylvia', 'played', 'Jobyna', 'Ralston', 'Richard', 'Arlen', 'David', 'who', 'also', 'Sylvia', 'Mary', 'Bow', 'Jack', 'Rogers', 'confusingly', 'David', 'love', 'quadrangle', 'even', 'more', 'tangled', 'when', 'Jack', 'effortlessly', 'conveniently', 'switches', 'affection', 'Sylvia', 'Mary', 'Once', 'however', 'viewer', 'rolls', 'numerous', 'romantic', 'plot', 'twists', 'can', 'see', 'aerial', 'fight', 'scenes', 'form', 'collective', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'anti-war', 'subtext', 'carnal', 'viciousness', 'much', 'later', 'graphic', 'killing', 'fields', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'appreciate', 'WINGS', 'one', 'must', 'view', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'did', 'WINGS', 'was', 'movie', 'plot', 'was', 'secondary', 'then', 'state', 'arts', 'special', 'effects', 'result', 'was', 'convincing', 'viscerally', 'effective', 'film', 'while', 'view', 'even', 'nearly', 'seventy-five', 'years']",N/A

216193,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6300215482,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","""Wings"" is an excellent film that deserved its Oscar for ""Best Production"" (the equivalent of ""Best Picture"") at the very first Oscars ceremony. The acting is terrific; Clara Bow proved she was much more than a romantic symbol--in all her scenes I couldn't take my eyes off of her; her acting was all THAT good. We get superb performances from the other actors as well. The sets were great and they went to great lengths to make the film as true to real life as possible; that in and of itself is a marvelous feat because the war scenes were usually very elaborate. The choreography and especially the cinematography couldn't have been better; that aerial photography really impressed me. The musical score enhances the film and the plot moves along very well; I was never bored.When the action begins, we quickly meet the principle characters of the story. Jack Powell (Charles 'Buddy' Rogers) is obsessed with his dreams of flying and racing cars; he simply doesn't notice the beautiful Mary (Clara Bow) who lives just next door and who loves him very much. David Armstrong (Richard Arlen) is the son of the wealthiest family in their small town; he and Sylvia (Jobyna Ralston) love each other so much yet Sylvia inevitably tries her best to fend off unwanted advances from Jack. Jack also loves Sylvia without realizing that Sylvia and David are true sweethearts.If that sounds like it could get a little complicated, things get far more complicated when America enters The Great War. Jack and David enlist; they want to be fighter pilots. During training Jack is not too fond of David; but they eventually become close friends and fly missions together in their planes. It also isn't long before Jack and David realize that war is not fun and games; early on they lose their new pal Cadet White (Gary Cooper) and the dogfights they have with the German enemy planes are downright scary--Jack, David and the other pilots could be killed at any moment. Indeed, it is ""kill or be killed;"" this is the way things are in war. This is also the point in the film that we first see its message--that war is horrific, terrible and never to be entered into lightly.I've left some of the plot out to keep it interesting for you; and I won't say too much more to avoid any spoilers. However, suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how Jack's friendship with David plays out; we also see how Mary helps people as an ambulance driver in France where Jack and David are fighting.Look also for fine performances by Ed Brendel as Herman Schwimpf; Henry B. Walthall as David's father and Julia Swayne Gordon as David's mother. Hedda Hopper is on screen for all of five or six seconds as Jack Powell's mother.I highly recommend ""Wings"" for anyone who appreciates first-rate silent film; and fans of the actors would do well to get this for their collections.

The plot she is tied to is very weak and I don't think the conclusion helps it too much (Clara's character leaving the war and her love interest changing his affections so effortlessly once he returned home). Her sexy image is really toned down as well. One scene has her luring her drunken boyfriend (a very funny drunken boyfriend) from a Paris night club in a skimpy number. The dress didn't fit the character's girl-next-door image at all.The real storyline is between pals Jack Powell and David Armstrong (played expertly by Buddy Rogers and Richard Arlen). Anyone interested in the First World War will find this film a real treat! The training scenes I found particularly interesting. Then there are the many aerial fighting scenes. They are so well done they look like documentary footage. Scenes shot from the pilot's point of view put the viewer right into the action! Scenes like these make the &quot;two guys in love with the same girl&quot; plot seem so insignificant.You also get two brief but excellent performances by a very young Gary Cooper and an aged Henry B. Walthall from Birth of A Nation fame.

It has all the ingredients and depth of any of Hollywood's actioners produced in the new millennium. In fact the formula of this film has been repeated and aped without any new invention. Just look at ""Flyboys"" to see how little action films have progressed since 1927. Under America's present administration certain productions have the unsubtle flavour of propaganda vehicles. Germans are treated as out and out villains just as they were in silent pictures before and during the First World War. Have we advanced at all in the medium of film?Oh yes, we now have C.G.I.For the most part the flying sequences in ""Wings"" are shot using real planes with the leading actors actually in the cockpits and in the air! The result is authentic and exhilarating! Computer Generated Effects are no match for the real thing and ""Wings"" proves it hands down. The pilots used for the acrobatic and dogfight scenes were veterans of World War One and their skill is awe-inspiring. A camera mounted on the nose of a plane captures with shocking clarity the death of a pilot and the ensuing free fall. The moment is so real, with the swirling vistas behind the pilot, that the line between art and reality is blurred. This is real film making!The acting is very good as well. There are none of the hammy performances that are normally associated with the silent era. Clara Bow is wonderful and quite modern! An early appearance by a strikingly hansom Gary Cooper is a great bonus.After a wonderful restoration of ""Wings"" done by Kevin Brownlow at Photoplay, could not Paramount release a DVD of this classic film with orchestral score, documentaries and commentary by Kevin Brownlow?

Read the other reviews for character development, story, etc. because that is not what I'm reviewing here.This review is not about the great movie.  It is about the very bad DVD I received.  I took delivery yesterday and popped it into my Sony BluRay player. The machine chugged and loaded and chugged some more, finally, FINALLY giving me the opening setup screen.  No command except Play (scene selection, setup, etc) would work.  I thought I had dead batteries in my clicker, so I replaced them.  Still, nothing.  So, I pressed 'play,' and all was well until I decided to pause the DVD to use the facilities.  The pause button was disabled, even to giving me a message on the screen that my input is presently forbidden.  So, I had to let it play while out of the room, or start over, as the resume function was disabled, too.The display on my player usually counts the time and the chapter.  Not with this BluRay disc.  All that displayed, for the entire length of the movie, was 'MENU.'  Go figure.  Then, at approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes into the film, the whole movie simply stopped.  It would not obey any clicker command, and I ended up having to unplug my machine and plug it back in to get it to eject.  The problem is NOT my player: everything else works fine.I'm grateful that Amazon gave me a 30 day rental of the film on their on-demand service.  I ended up watching the last hour of the movie via my Roku streaming device.  I conclude that somebody really dropped the ball in quality control here.Figuring that Amazon might have an Amazon-on-demand version, since they did give me the movie on a 30 day rental, I was surprised and disappointed to find that no on-demand version exists for separate purchase.  So, I went over to my iTunes account, and bought it again, in HD, and downloaded it to my hard drive.I don't know where the mess was made, but a mess was surely made.  Please fix the disc quality, and please provide an on-demand version.  Sorry Amazon, you sold me a lemon and you lost my business to iTunes over it.

Wings was the first - and what a way to start the whole process! I'm embarrassed to admit I had never seen more than a few snippets of it, until I watched the newly restored version in 2012. Put together by film historian Kevin Brownlow for the 85th anniversary of its release, it premiered at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival in April of that year. No doubt about it, Wings is a singular film achievement, one that's unlikely to be duplicated. It's a movie that received more support - logistical and financial - from the U.S. government than any other. Shot entirely at or around Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, the production included thousands of soldiers as extras, hundreds of military aircraft, real artillery barrages, and astounding aerial sequences. Together, these elements plant Wings firmly among America's movie treasures. But don't sell the story short, because it's also part of the movie's greatness. Basically, it's a wartime love triangle starring the adorable Clara Bow as a smalltown girl, and Charles ""Buddy"" Rogers and Richard Arlen as her two competing suitors. Arlen had been a pilot in France during World War I, but Rogers had never even been in a plane. I bring this up because many of the aerial shots in the movie were flown - and photographed - by the two actors themselves under the supervision of Wellman, himself a fighter pilot in the war. That meant Rogers had to learn to fly, and he does it so well that some of his sequences are positively breathtaking. But it's the melodrama that takes things over the top.

216208,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6300215482,Randy Keehn,"[2, 2]","Much note has already been made of the fact that ""Wings"" won the very first ""Best Picture"" Oscar.  It's worth repeating since that, and the presence of Gary Cooper in a minor role were the reasons I chose to watch it.  For the record, I thought I might have trouble picking out Cooper but he was the main focus on the screen in the brief time he appeared.  Clara Bow was the main star in name and billing although hers was essentially a supporting role.  Some may disagree with that but I felt the real strength of ""Wings"" was the aerial combat and its' brilliant camera work.  The essential story is two rivals for the hand of the other girl they left behind and how their competion turned them into flyering Aces.  The script was above the standard of its' day (although this is no ""Grand Illusion"").Near the end the story takes an unusual twist which led to a most bizarre extended scene.  For the record, this is a silent movie and my wife came into the room wanting to hear (on the radio) the high school baseball team play in the state championship game (they won 1-0) so I turned the sound completely off while I watched the ending.  I probably missed some very sad music that could have changed my perspective of the scene in question and I certainly understood the cameraderie that had developed between the two men and the poignant circumstances.  However, I couldn't help but think that I was watching the most expressive love scene between two men in the first 50-60 years of Cinema.

216209,A2TY359PR45ATP,6300215482,"R. Edward Merrell, Jr. ""emerrell2""","[1, 1]","This new Blu-Ray version of this classic silent film has been perfectly - and I'm sure painstakingly - restored and remastered, a monumental accomplishment, especially considering the age of the negative. This film won the first Academy Award for Best Picture - called Best Production back then - and is the only silent film to hold that honor. It was directed by the great William &#34;Wild Bill&#34; Wellman, who was himself a WW I combat pilot...as was co-star, Richard Arlen. The story features an excellent love story (both on and off the screen) - Richard Arlen began a romance w/Jobyna Ralston, who played his on-screen love interest, Sylvia, and later married her. Clara Bow's character, Mary, was in love w/Jack, the Buddy Rogers character, who was also in love w/Sylvia. Bow, off screen, began an affair w/Gary Cooper, who had a small but important role in the film...he made the most of it and it proved to be his breakout role. The best part of the film are the scenes featuring aerial combat...and they are among the best in cinema! The fragile WW I fighters and bombers were not much more than wood, canvas and glue, enclosing an engine and an open cockpit, with a machine gun mounted, usually in front of the pilot. The pilot had little protection and when he or his plane was shot up, he went down with it...there were no parachutes. There were no special effects in 1927 to replicate air combat...what you see on the screen is what was actually filmed. I think this is only the second silent era film I've watched all the way through. If you watch it you will note right away that the actors over-act their parts to compensate for the lack of audible dialogue. I'm not a big fan of silent films but this one is so exquisitely crafted and has been so superbly restored, I found it to be a joy to watch. My highest recommendation. -",5,"""Do you know what you can do when you see a falling star?",1360540800,"02 11, 2013",2013,1847,"['new', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'classic', 'silent', 'film', 'been', 'perfectly', ""'m"", 'sure', 'painstakingly', 'restored', 'remastered', 'monumental', 'accomplishment', 'especially', 'considering', 'age', 'negative', 'film', 'won', 'first', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'called', 'Best', 'Production', 'back', 'then', 'only', 'silent', 'film', 'hold', 'honor', 'was', 'directed', 'great', 'William', '34', 'Wild', 'Bill', '34', 'Wellman', 'who', 'was', 'WW', 'combat', 'pilot', 'was', 'co-star', 'Richard', 'Arlen', 'story', 'excellent', 'love', 'story', 'screen', 'Richard', 'Arlen', 'began', 'romance', 'w/Jobyna', 'Ralston', 'who', 'played', 'on-screen', 'love', 'interest', 'Sylvia', 'later', 'married', 'Clara', 'Bow', 'character', 'Mary', 'was', 'love', 'w/Jack', 'Buddy', 'Rogers', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'love', 'w/Sylvia', 'Bow', 'off', 'screen', 'began', 'affair', 'w/Gary', 'Cooper', 'who', 'had', 'small', 'important', 'role', 'film', 'made', 'most', 'proved', 'be', 'breakout', 'role', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'are', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'aerial', 'combat', 'are', 'best', 'cinema', 'fragile', 'WW', 'fighters', 'bombers', 'were', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'wood', 'canvas', 'glue', 'enclosing', 'engine', 'open', 'cockpit', 'machine', 'gun', 'mounted', 'usually', 'front', 'pilot', 'pilot', 'had', 'little', 'protection', 'when', 'plane', 'was', 'shot', 'up', 'went', 'down', 'were', 'parachutes', 'were', 'special', 'effects', '1927', 'replicate', 'air', 'combat', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed', 'think', 'only', 'second', 'silent', 'era', 'film', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'way', 'watch', 'will', 'note', 'right', 'away', 'actors', 'over-act', 'parts', 'compensate', 'lack', 'audible', 'dialogue', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'silent', 'films', 'one', 'so', 'exquisitely', 'crafted', 'been', 'so', 'superbly', 'restored', 'found', 'be', 'joy', 'watch', 'highest', 'recommendation']",N/A

216212,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,6300215482,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","Wings(released Aug/27)has always been touted as the winner of the first Best Picture award.Technically this is not the case.When they won their award in 1929 it was for the Most Outstanding Production for 1927/28.It was a year later that a Best Production award was instituted and the Academy decided retrospectively that that was to be the equivalent award.A year after that,this was again changed to Best Picture,whose namesake it has remained to this day.No matter,this was the start of Hollywoodland's(after /49,Hollywood's)self congratulatory back slapping.Wings has been restored magnificently by Paramount,this their first release in their 100th birthday celebration.The original tinting and length is back.The only thing you won't see,as in the original theatrical release,is one of the early uses of Magnascope,a widescreeen effect used in some sequences.Starring in this extravaganza is Charles Buddy Rogers,who became better known as a bigband leader and went on to steal Mary Pickford's heart in real life.Richard Arlen was a Paramount contract player at the time and he went on to marry his Wings co-star Jobyna Ralston,well known as a staple in many a Harold Lloyd film.Gary Cooper got his career start in this film,at the time the boyfriend to the star of the picture Clara Bow.Clara eats up the scenery every moment she is in the film.It is a testimony to Clara's emoting and acting skills in general that we get so involved,that we literally want to reach out and dry those tears away from her eyes.To top this,she is in and out of the film throughout its run,with far less screen time than her co stars Arlen and Rogers.But when you think of Wings,Clara is pretty much the first person you think of.William Wellman of course directs and this is,to my knowledge,one of only two Wellman silents that still exist,which speaks volumes about film preservation.It was the the French Cinemateque that rescued Wings originally and it was the George Eastman House that rescued Wellmans other 1928 classic Beggars of life,starring Wings co star Arlen along with the iconic Louise Brooks.If it was not for these institutions,certainly not Paramount,we would have neither film to view today.A sorry commentary,indeed.The plot of this film starts out with Rogers as Jack,who longs to be a pilot.He has a secret love in Clara(Mary),who lives next door and is always hanging around him,but is hardly noticed by the car tinkerer.Jack and another richer kid Arlen(David),vie for the affections of Ralston(Sylvia).However it is David that has really stolen the heart of Sylvia.When War comes and both boys volunteer for active duty,Sylvia doesn't have the heart to crush Jacks feelings.Over there,both are accepted into pilot training and become rivals.After a fist fight during training,Jack and David become fast friends and they are inseparable flying buddies from then on.The War is a bitter pill to swallow at times as they see some of their closest friends get killed,and every mission could be their last.Mary in the meantime has also joined as an ambulance driver and is wandering the small towns of the French countryside,helping where she's needed.She herself gets into some close scrapes,such as coming into a town which is seemingly deserted,only because the troops have taken shelter from an incoming German bomber.She dives under her truck narrowly escaping death.Out of the sky comes Jack who has made quite a rep for himself in the air and on the ground.One of the soldiers recognizes the shooting star logo on the side of his plane;the exact same one Mary drew on his car back home.Mary instantly shouts up to Jack,who of course flies off unawares.On a furlough in Paris Jack and David live it up to the max.David gets lucky while Jack never quite gets there(though he will always think he did),as he is just too drunk;seeing bubbles in everything.Mary happens to find Jack,tempts him away from a pretty French mademoiselle,and gets him to bed to sleep it off.However some MPs burst in on the two while Mary is changing back to her uniform and Mary is summarily sent back home.The war continues and one day David is having a premonition that he is not coming back from their next mission alive.Jack poo-poos it and during a subsequent conversation,the two get into an argument over a picture of Sylvia Jack carries in his locket.They fly into the skies not speaking to each other.While airborne the two get separated when David ends up taking on a squadron of German planes by himself,while Jack carries on to the target of some observation balloons and destroys them.David gets wounded and is shot down and goes on the run behind German lines.Jack is devastated and when a German plane drops a note saying David was shot down and seemingly dead,Jack goes on a path of revenge for his buddy.Meanwhile David manages to steal a German plane and escape towards American lines.Jack who has been on the prowl shooting up everything he sees that is enemy,spies this plane going towards his lines.He pursues the plane and shoots it down.Landing to get the insignia off the plane rear rudder,he finds out it is David who he shot down,and who is dying before his eyes.They have a tearful and heartfelt last few moments together,as David tries to assuage Jacks guilt.The War ends and Jack returns a hero.However the inevitable meeting with Davids parents comes and he is in tears.Realizing Jacks grief and remorse the two grieving parents reconcile their feelings towards the man who killed their son.Jack returns home and Mary,of course,is there still waiting;a little older and a little more reticent than her younger self.However Mary's undying love for Jack has never waned and Jack finally realizes that his true love was just across the fence all the time.Wellman put great effort into his spectacular flying sequences and it certainly shows.I think the pictures main failing is that the sub stories of the relationships between the men and the men and women,never quite gets the same loving attention.Wellman also brought in comic El Brendel as Herman Scwimpf,the colourful ""foreigner"" who washes out in pilot training,but he was superfluous.There was enough comedy in the plot already,especially when Clara was on the scene.Having said that,there is no doubt the film packs a wallop even today.It has everything from drama,to comedy,to pathos and everything in between.While the film may seem a little uneven,it is still over all a well crafted picture and deserves the many laurels it has received over time and its place in cinematic history.Technically speaking the film has been restored beautifully and the picture,while showing its age from time to time,is generally crisp and amazingly clear.The only extra(and this for Paramount's first 100th anniversary release at that!)is a featurette about the film's history and making by some ""experts"".All in all this a film must have for every film buff out there.It has been restored to pristine condition and its story pulls you in almost from the start.All the stars do a great job but Clara is simply amazing to behold and it is fitting that she should have been in the first film to get the Most Outstanding Picture award(later to become Best Picture).While I would like to think this may be a trend to further restoration and release of more silent film titles(I would love to see a restored Beggars of Life,Paramount!),I am not holding my breath.",5,Wings-an absolute

Everyone seems to agree, at least, that the flight sequences are amazing --- some of the best ever filmed.  Wellman  held up production so that the skies would look just right behind the  planes. Quite striking...  If you're a Clara Bow fan, she's not really in  this quite enough, but she is certainly adorable and looks great in her  uniform.  One complaint I've heard about this film is that Buddy Rogers  isn't a compelling enough actor.  This is hogwash, I think, and I can't  understand why I keep reading it.  He's perfectly charming, and very  moving, in a couple of scenes in particular.  Adding to the enjoyment are a  few unique directorial choices --- the bizarre bubbles floating all around  in the drunk scene and some very strange camera movements for example.  It's nice to see Gary Cooper (VERY briefly) so young, too.  Apparently he  &quot;stole&quot; the scene he was in, and had everyone talking about him.  Really, he just sort of pops in for a minute and looks handsome and sweet,  but it's nice to see him nonetheless...

216219,A37S3ACL57LN62,6300215482,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[3, 3]","Wings has always been one of my favorite silent movies. It deserves every bit of acclaim that it received at the time of its release, including the first Oscar for best picture. It concerns a group of young people (Buddy Rogers, Richard Arlen, and Clara Bow) who join the military to fight in WWI. The men become fliers and Bow is a driver who pines for Rogers. Director William Wellman did a phenomenal job illustrating the story with real flight sequences and an attention to detail that is now available to behold in a clear and astoundingly restored print.I can't rave enough about this restoration. The first time I saw this film, it was on VHS, and the print was not tinted, nor was it fully restored. Several scenes had deterioration and almost all of them had the usual artifacts and scratches. But it was a highly watchable print, and I saw it many times. This blu-ray print puts that one to shame, and in fact, I can't recall seeing such a transformation in a silent film ever. There isn't a single blight on a single frame. All of the scratches are gone, and the scenes are brought to life with beautiful tinting, which was done according to the notes from the original screenings. The original score has also been recorded to provide the most accurate experience to date of what it would have been like to see the film in 1927. But for those of you who saw and loved the older edition, the Gaylord Carter organ score is available too.The only issue I had with the blu-ray was a minor one. I watched it on my PS3, and for some reason, this movie does not fast forward, rewind, pause, or play the way any other disk does. I had to pull up the menu to make these options work.",5,The Most Beautiful Restoration of a Silent I Have Ever Seen,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,1685,"['Wings', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'silent', 'movies', 'bit', 'acclaim', 'received', 'time', 'release', 'including', 'first', 'Oscar', 'best', 'picture', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'Buddy', 'Rogers', 'Richard', 'Arlen', 'Clara', 'Bow', 'who', 'join', 'military', 'fight', 'WWI', 'men', 'become', 'fliers', 'Bow', 'driver', 'who', 'Rogers', 'Director', 'William', 'Wellman', 'did', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'illustrating', 'story', 'real', 'flight', 'sequences', 'attention', 'detail', 'now', 'available', 'behold', 'clear', 'astoundingly', 'restored', 'print.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rave', 'enough', 'restoration', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'VHS', 'print', 'was', 'not', 'tinted', 'was', 'fully', 'restored', 'Several', 'scenes', 'had', 'deterioration', 'almost', 'had', 'usual', 'artifacts', 'scratches', 'was', 'highly', 'watchable', 'print', 'saw', 'many', 'times', 'blu-ray', 'print', 'one', 'shame', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'such', 'transformation', 'silent', 'film', 'ever', ""n't"", 'single', 'blight', 'single', 'frame', 'scratches', 'are', 'gone', 'scenes', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'beautiful', 'tinting', 'was', 'done', 'according', 'notes', 'original', 'screenings', 'original', 'score', 'also', 'been', 'recorded', 'provide', 'most', 'accurate', 'experience', 'date', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'see', 'film', '1927', 'who', 'saw', 'loved', 'older', 'edition', 'Gaylord', 'Carter', 'organ', 'score', 'available', 'only', 'issue', 'had', 'blu-ray', 'was', 'minor', 'one', 'watched', 'PS3', 'reason', 'movie', 'not', 'fast', 'forward', 'rewind', 'pause', 'play', 'way', 'other', 'disk', 'had', 'pull', 'up', 'menu', 'make', 'options', 'work']",N/A
