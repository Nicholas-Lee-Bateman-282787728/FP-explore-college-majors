1654156,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B00D7AM2YW,a,"[0, 0]","""Line of Duty"" is a self-contained, five-episode miniseries that's both intense and intelligent, making up for a lack of action with compelling character studies and realistic performances.  Over the past few months I have become a big fan of the UK programming released stateside by Acorn Media.  (Other Acorn titles worth checking out include The Fall, Jack Irish, and Jack Taylor series).  Unlike those other ""Series One"" installments, however, ""Line of Duty"" wraps itself up very nicely, complete with concluding text that ties up all the loose ends.  I figured there would be something of a cliffhanger or at least a few lingering questions to warrant a second series.  Instead this feels more like a well-executed miniseries, and yet as I type this we are only four days away from the UK premiere of Series Two. That said, having enjoyed Series One, I am eager to catch up with whatever characters return for the second go-round.I watched this series with my spouse, and we discussed each of the five episodes.  One of us got engaged with the storyline front the start, caring for (at least a few of) the characters and eager to see how things ended up.  The other was less enthused and actually considered abandoning the series after the first hour-long episode.  The reason?  Primarily, it was a case of too many characters, introduced way too fast, with too much heavily-accented dialogue.  In the end, we both stuck with the program, and we were both fans by the conclusion of Episode Five.  Our conclusion is that you just have to give it a chance, and even if the first episode doesn't quite meet expectations, things dramatically improve by around the middle of Episode Two.Most Acorn Media titles include some type of special feature.  ""Line of Duty"" delivers a full hour of additional content, divided between behind-the-scenes footage and some rather bland but ultimately worthwhile talking head interviews with the main cast and creators.  For us, the English subtitles -- thankfully found on virtually all of Acorn Media's titles -- are the best special features since the accents and rapid-fire dialogue make it difficult at times to follow the story.  All in all, you're getting a little over six hours of entertainment that really is just as good if not better than the best crime dramas on American television.",5,"Compelling, character-driven miniseries",1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,2332,"['Line', 'Duty', 'self-contained', 'five-episode', 'miniseries', 'intense', 'intelligent', 'making', 'up', 'lack', 'action', 'compelling', 'character', 'studies', 'realistic', 'performances', 'past', 'few', 'months', 'have', 'become', 'big', 'fan', 'UK', 'programming', 'released', 'stateside', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'Other', 'Acorn', 'titles', 'checking', 'out', 'include', 'Fall', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'Jack', 'Taylor', 'series', 'other', 'Series', 'One', 'installments', 'however', 'Line', 'Duty', 'up', 'very', 'nicely', 'complete', 'concluding', 'text', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'cliffhanger', 'least', 'few', 'lingering', 'questions', 'warrant', 'second', 'series', 'Instead', 'more', 'well-executed', 'miniseries', 'yet', 'type', 'are', 'only', 'four', 'days', 'away', 'UK', 'premiere', 'Series', 'Two', 'said', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'Series', 'One', 'am', 'eager', 'catch', 'up', 'characters', 'return', 'second', 'go-round.I', 'watched', 'series', 'spouse', 'discussed', 'five', 'episodes', 'One', 'got', 'engaged', 'storyline', 'start', 'caring', 'least', 'few', 'characters', 'eager', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'ended', 'up', 'other', 'was', 'less', 'enthused', 'actually', 'considered', 'abandoning', 'series', 'first', 'hour-long', 'episode', 'reason', 'Primarily', 'was', 'case', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'introduced', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'too', 'much', 'heavily-accented', 'dialogue', 'end', 'stuck', 'program', 'were', 'fans', 'conclusion', 'Episode', 'Five', 'conclusion', 'just', 'have', 'give', 'chance', 'even', 'first', 'episode', ""n't"", 'quite', 'meet', 'expectations', 'things', 'dramatically', 'improve', 'middle', 'Episode', 'Two.Most', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'titles', 'include', 'type', 'special', 'feature', 'Line', 'Duty', 'full', 'hour', 'additional', 'content', 'divided', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'rather', 'bland', 'ultimately', 'worthwhile', 'talking', 'head', 'interviews', 'main', 'cast', 'creators', 'English', 'subtitles', 'thankfully', 'found', 'virtually', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'titles', 'are', 'best', 'special', 'features', 'accents', 'rapid-fire', 'dialogue', 'make', 'difficult', 'times', 'follow', 'story', ""'re"", 'getting', 'little', 'six', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'really', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'best', 'crime', 'dramas', 'American', 'television']","LINE OF DUTY, SERIES 1"

These are just a few words to describe Line of Duty Series 1, a thrill-ride through corruption, obsession and justice.Tony Gates seems like a good cop, but he isn't all he seems. Tony is thrust into a trap of his own making, and must outwit his fellow cops to protect what he loves the most.Enough to get you interested? I hope so! This series is taut, thrilling and I don't want to give away a minute of what happens.There were a few times I sat back, jaw open, thinking, Did that really just happen?!? The unexpected turns kept me interested through the short series. I could not stop watching. I will say I had an idea of the whodunit at the end and some fans of the police procedural genre may also figure it out. But the journey to get there is one not to regret.The story is told a lot like The Killing, except it is much shorter. I appreciated fewer episodes. Things stayed focused, intense, without going too far off the beaten path. Some might say you need extra time for red herrings, but I say Line of Duty offered enough twists to hold its own in half the time of The Killing.A surprisingly twisted plot with rogue characters will keep viewers guessing to the bloody end.Fans of The Killing and is European counterpart should definitely check out this series!",5,Fans of The Killing should check this out,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,1300,"['Intense', 'Gritty', 'Compelling', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'words', 'describe', 'Line', 'Duty', 'Series', '1', 'thrill-ride', 'corruption', 'obsession', 'justice.Tony', 'Gates', 'good', 'cop', ""n't"", 'all', 'Tony', 'thrust', 'trap', 'own', 'making', 'must', 'outwit', 'fellow', 'cops', 'protect', 'what', 'most.Enough', 'get', 'interested', 'hope', 'so', 'series', 'taut', 'thrilling', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'minute', 'what', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'sat', 'back', 'jaw', 'open', 'thinking', 'Did', 'really', 'just', 'happen', 'unexpected', 'turns', 'kept', 'interested', 'short', 'series', 'could', 'not', 'stop', 'watching', 'will', 'say', 'had', 'idea', 'whodunit', 'end', 'fans', 'police', 'procedural', 'genre', 'may', 'also', 'figure', 'out', 'journey', 'get', 'one', 'not', 'regret.The', 'story', 'told', 'lot', 'Killing', 'much', 'shorter', 'appreciated', 'fewer', 'episodes', 'Things', 'stayed', 'focused', 'intense', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'beaten', 'path', 'might', 'say', 'need', 'extra', 'time', 'red', 'herrings', 'say', 'Line', 'Duty', 'offered', 'enough', 'twists', 'hold', 'own', 'time', 'Killing.A', 'surprisingly', 'twisted', 'plot', 'rogue', 'characters', 'will', 'keep', 'viewers', 'guessing', 'bloody', 'end.Fans', 'Killing', 'European', 'counterpart', 'should', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'series']","LINE OF DUTY, SERIES 1"

The award winning Detective Chief Tony Gates has been lauded as the top cop of the year, even as internal affairs is questioning his unrealistically high rate of case closures. They are sure he is laddering-cherry picking the cases that he can solve and also add additional charge and case-solutions to at the same time. Gates is not the only one who sees how the system really works and uses it to advantage--a female officer hears of a job opening and refers to her high chance of being hired due to &#34;gender balance&#34; quotas.

Sometimes cops are bad. &#34;Officer of the Year&#34; Tony Gates is under suspicion of corruption. Another officer, Arnott, is being investigated for directing a police beak-in on a London terrorist cell. Problem. Wrong flat. An innocent Muslim is gunned-down while holding his crying baby boy. Arnott is transferred, and he'd like to pop Tony Gates. Tony Gates isn't clean. He cheats on his wife and two daughters with a mistress. Tony's girlfriend has too much to drink one night, and plows into a wealthy Londoner in her car(or did she want to rub-out a business enemy?). Tony deletes the hit-and-run computer file on his girlfriend. He may also be involved in a gang-land murder. Tony Gates is an arrogant policeman, and he is complex. Dark and edgy, &#34;Line of Duty&#34; builds to a stunning climax, a showdown you won't expect...Lennie James is very good as Tony Gates, but Martin Compston, as Arnott, is all &#34;rolling eyes&#34;, and weird smirks. DVD extras include interviews with the writer, directors, and the cast(47 minutes), and behind-the-scenes footage(10 minutes).

1654168,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00D7AM2YW,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[0, 0]","""Line Of Duty""(BBC/Acorn Media, 2012). . .British TV has gotten quite grim and graphic in the last couple of decades, as seen in this taut, tense police thriller about a celebrated English police detective under investigation for possible corruption and tampering with evidence. This five-part series features a strong cast of actors (all little known to American eyes, which I for one find to be a plus) portraying complex characters, each morally challenged to different degrees by the tensions between professional duty and real-world efficiency, where crime stats often interfere with crime fighting. Like HBO's ""The Wire,"" or ""Prime Suspect,"" ""Luther,"" and other modern British cop shows, this is a dark, frequently upsetting drama, slowly ratcheting up from uncomfortable ethical dilemmas to gruesome, almost nauseating violence. It's quite well written, very well acted and impeccably produced. Highly recommended, though perhaps not for the faint of heart.

There's no quibble about whether &#34;Line of Duty&#34; is good or not, though: it's terrific.  Lennie James (from the films Snatch, 24 Hour Party People, and the TV shows &#34;Walking Dead,&#34; &#34;Jericho&#34; and &#34;Low Winter Sun,&#34; among others) is unabashedly great as DCI Tony Gates. Adrian Dunbar, who was ubiquitous in the 1990s and who I now periodically wonder what's happened to, makes an appearance as Superintendent Hastings, and the rest of the supporting cast is quite good. It's a gritty, sometimes graphic police drama, plenty of tension both on and off the job. There are some credulity issues here, plot lines where it's difficult to suspend belief, but my biggest beef, which I will be vague about as to avoid spoilers, is the frequent use of the old-fashioned noir &#34;dames ain't nothing but trouble&#34; trope. It's such a modern story that the trope seems out of place, and used in such a way that it feels like they had trouble writing the female characters.

Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure) is an overworked, under-appreciated young female cop struggling for respect in the male-dominated world of New Scotland Yard. Tony Gates (Lennie James) is a veteran cop; brash, confident, with a cadre of almost-sycophantic ;underlings that he trusts implicitly - and a closet skeleton that he wants to keep hidden. Gates also has the best 'solved' record in the department. So, of course, Internal Affairs targets him. Nobody is THAT good.Arnott, after his sensationalized blunder, is reassigned to Internal Affairs, where he will be effectively out of the public eye. Kate Fleming is also recruited to infiltrate Gates' loyal little unit, to scope out whatever dirt she can find about him. And as things turn out, it happens that the infidelity that Gates is trying to keep hidden has far more behind it than a quick fling.Engrossing and dark, tightly written and absorbing, 'Line of Duty' draws the viewer into a slimy underbelly of London crime that slowly expands into a vast stinking cesspool of personnel and events. Certainly none of the law-enforcement components of this tale have any idea at the beginning of the scope of the matter, nor how everything is connected; and the viewer is torn between disgust over Gates' weakness in getting involved in something he could easily - and with prudence - have avoided, and a certain degree of sympathy for him as he struggles desperately to conjure up a way out of his predicament.British crime dramas represent some of the best writing of the genre, and 'Line of Duty' is no exception. The viewer can identify with each protagonist, and one comes away from viewing this with the feeling that the audience has been treated with respect and a regard for intelligence.

BUT if you are looking for an intelligent and well crafted dramatic thriller with its share of chase scenes and intrigue, then this is your kind of show.Brits do these wonderful short &#34;mini-series&#34; (my word, not theirs). They take well written scripts with well developed, fully realized characters and find actors who can portray them and then let them have at it.Some British mini-series (i.e. Sherlock, which has three episodes to a season instead of our 22 in the States) are short some are longer, but by and large, my experience has led me to realize that the writing is far superior to what we have on U.S. television.  Also, these shorter series are more satisfying and keep the show and characters fresh and keep us from getting bored (who can remember how irritating we all felt being strung along for &#34;Lost&#34; or &#34;Heroes&#34;?).Line of Duty centers on a Chief Inspector who has been cherry picking his cases so he can be &#34;Policeman of the Year&#34;. This sparks an internal affairs investigation, which is intended to get him reprimanded.

Well developed plot, sub-plots, and characters that remain edge-of-the-seat scary for hours. It's hard to tread water in quicksand when it's sucking the life out of you. It's not the typical bad cop-good cop drama.Fingers bolt-cuttered, neck slashing, drugs, language and other bad boy stuff makes this intense crime suspense and not for the kiddies.Martin Compston (Monarch of the Glen) leads as DS Arnott, new AC-12 (anti-corruption unit) after a bungled raid. His boss is Hastings (Adrian Dunbar) and Arnott gets lost of double agent style help for his first case, DCI Gates (Lennie James) from DC Fleming (Vicky McClure). Gina McKee plays a business woman, crook, & mistress well enough for an award. The list is endless as 23 characters appear frequently. You meet them all personally. Some could give you nightmares.SDH SUBTITLES for all:1 Arnott in disgrace is transferred to AC-12 and given a ""very special"" case. DCI Gates wins the medal as hero, is exemplarly, an ace in arrests but is it all true? His private life makes him suspect, including his on-the-side lover, Jackie (Gina McKee-Forsyte Saga).2 Gates prizes his job & kids. Will he lose both? Jackie's cop connection is discovered and a link to crime deepens arriving with deadly potential.3 After regaining consciousness Gates mishandles evidence. His ""old flame"" as he claims, disappears. Arnott's queries are ""over the line"". Gates puts on investigative pressure only to have it backfire on himself.4 Money laundering case goes to Fraud Squad.

If you like the early writing of author James Patterson(back when he was really good), then you're going to love this series. This is a British police drama(dark crime drama), but don't let that sway you from buying it. There is plenty of drama and plenty suspense to go along with a healthy dose of twists and turns. Add to that that I really dig actor Lennie James. He's superb in this and even the supporting cast is excellent. Even though there are only 5 episodes it deals with something different each time(drug dealing, police corruption, terrorism, etc.), but there are several different plots in these episodes that weave their way through to the end leaving you wanting even more.Which is my only complaint... why only 5 episodes? Arrggghhh! I am ridiculously addicted the this show and fornunately Series 2 with be coming out this year. Way to go Acorn! From what I've read/researched there is to be a whopping 6 episodes for Series 2. Why can't they make it 12 or 16 episodes, like The Walking Dead, which Lennie James is also in? I just hope they don't do like BBC did to one of my other favorite British television series, Ripper Street, and axe it after just two seasons. Shameful!

1654179,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00D7AM2YW,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","(Insert cusswords here to reflect amazement.) What a ripper of a show is BBC2's Line of Duty. It's a cop show with so much grit I feel like I just toured a sandblaster emporium. Line of Duty, be aware, isn't for the squeamish. The violence comes infrequently but with shocking abruptness. And Lennie James, scintillating as he's been for a while now, still doesn't get his propers. Guy can act the hell out of any scene.But let's table Lennie James and whom he plays for a mo. The first episode opens with a botched antiterrorist raid. An unarmed and innocent man goes down, chest dotted with a policeman's bullets. And here's Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott (Martin Compston), on-scene coordinator, not inclined to sweep things under the rug, much to the ire of his supervising officer. DS Arnott has got righteous conviction on his side, much good may it do him. And when he's reassigned to the anti-corruption unit and promptly tasked with investigating Britain's most decorated copper, well, now he's really got to brace for those sidelong glances cast by his peers.We each sow our seeds of destruction, ain't it so? How shady is Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates (Lennie James), recipient of ""Officer of the Year"" in his district? Certainly his professional conduct seems beyond reproach. But DS Arnott's new boss, Superintendent Hastings (Adrian Dunbar), is dusting off that bromide about something being ""too good to be true."" He suspects Gates is dirty. He sics DS Arnott on him. He says, ""No one's that good. What's his secret, Steve?""Line of Duty attempts a realistic approach but is, of course, understandably undermined by the need to put on an entertaining show. So some scenes are sensationalized, hyper-realized. It's an expos&eacute; on corruption within the British police force, and not only corruption in the sense that bent coppers are on the take but rather also in the sense that the system itself is corrupted by administrators more concerned with tweaking the crime stats than properly solving cases. The term ""laddering"" plays a key role. ""Laddering"" is defined by a top brass as the ""buffing up of our figures to make it look like more crimes have been solved."" That's awesome.Were Line of Duty only about the cat and mouse games between the disgraced cop and the decorated cop, it'd still be must-see viewing. We're treated to many highly charged moments between James and Compston. But then throw in the twists and big reveals and a gut-churning cliffhanger ending or two (two words: ""extreme manicure""), and the show's watchability reaches addictive proportions. I only intended to watch one episode per night. I ended up marathoning the series; I wasn't at all right for work the next morning. I'd talked up the two leads, but there's a third core character. I won't go too much into DS Kate Fleming's (Vicky McClure) arc. I'll say that we don't learn the most important thing in her personal life until this first series' final minutes.We're soaked in the grimy, unctuous feel of it. It's a cop world populated by deceivers and obfuscaters and the straight-up corrupt, the righteous cops stifled by the paper pushers and bean counters and gladhanders in their midst. And if you're not sure how ostracized are the officers working in the anti-corruption unit, well, this show may open your eyes. But bring along one of those Gallagher tarps lest you catch them looks of utter disdain and, also, the flying sputum.Don't fret, these coppers also look into crimes committed not internal of the precinct: serial break-ins, brutal homicides, drug deals. And it's crazy how a routine car accident escalates into a damning in-house conspiracy. In five episodes, Line of Duty reminds us all over again that Hell is paved with good intentions. It documents the sometimes tattered loyalty of those who serve in the front line and the crippling inertia of bureaucracy. For whatever reason, I got a kick out of those scenes in which that one beat cop would always minimize a potential crime because she just didn't want that deluge of paperwork.Line of Duty was reportedly the best-performing drama series on the BBC2 in ten years. You bet your puppy there'll be a Series 2. I look forward to a fresh batch of bent coppers and cover-ups and supremely etched characters and ever shifting allegiances and my losing sleep and DS Arnott's boss cautioning him all over again: ""A little decorum please, DS Arnott."" Because, occasionally, DS Arnott tends to lose his sh--. It's fun.Some parting thoughts/observations/whatever (and, yeah, some SPOILERS for this bit):- It bugs me that, in episode 5, DS Arnott suddenly develops a man crush on Gates; yeah, Gates rescued him but did Arnott forget that it was Gates who gave him up to those finger-chopping loons just some minutes before? DS Arnott's change of heart seems very much a plot device to set things in motion for the finale.- I thought I'd never loathe another minor as much as I loathe King Joffrey, but that punk kid on the BMX really boils my blood pressure.- So I guess that special needs person still has that corpse in his freezer, huh?The DVD set's bonus stuff:- Behind the scenes footage (00:09:58 minutes)- Interviews

I am a fan of a wide variety of British dramas, comedies, and mysteries, but this one just didn't draw me in.  The characters are fairly complex.  The story revolves around DCI Gates, who appears to be the poster boy for excellent police work.  He is investigated by the UK version of Internal Affairs.  Is Gates as clean as he appears to be or does the Superintendent (IA) just have it in for him?  If you still care after about 30 minutes, then this series is for you.  It is certainly dark, gritty, edgy, and all the other trendy adjectives for drama these days.  Unfortunately, not a one of the characters is remotely likable.  Even Gates, who is set up to be the hero is himself cheating on his wife.  His mistress is the one who leads him into temptation to skirt the law (I'll avoid spoilers here).A little bit of Midsomer Murders, only without the good characters and humor.  Perhaps a little bit of The Last Enemy, without the techno-thriller aspects.  Maybe some Rebus thrown in?

DCI Gates looks like the perfect cop from the outside: good numbers, Policeman of the Year, and a family man.  DS Arnott's had a tough go, having once been a rising star of the anti-terrorism unit until a mistake puts him out of the game.  Anti-Corruption may be his ticket to bigger and better things and so he gets pulled into Gates's circle looking for any edge that will help AC and bring down the man that looks so perfect.  In the mix is DC Fleming, the lone female of Gates's squad to help the department numbers look better and a determined cop herself.Line of Duty isn't always the most gripping of shows all the time, nor is it the tensest of thrillers from start to finish.  What it does well is give you a story that's got a few twists and turns every time you start to get comfortable and make you feel something toward the characters.  With only five one hour episodes to get it right, the writers make each second count and each story arc connect in some way to the greater whole up through the final heart-pounding moments.  You'll love and loath each character in turn right to the very end.  The casting in Line of Duty is superb and filled with vaguely familiar faces from other British dramas who all play their parts with gusto.  With its subject matter you may feel like you're inundated with too much cop action, but that fact that it's police investigating other police actually helps set this show apart from other cop dramas.  The only problem may be that, at times, the plot seems a little off the rails and slightly unbelievable.  If you're a fan of British drama that attempts to keep it real (by which I mean the inclusion of drugs, swearing, and violence) instead of light and humorous, particularly the investigative kind of drama, check this one out.",4,Cop vs Cop Crime Drama,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,1885,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'police', 'police', 'investigating', 'Line', 'Duty', 'right', 'series', 'DCI', 'Gates', 'perfect', 'cop', 'outside', 'good', 'numbers', 'Policeman', 'Year', 'family', 'man', 'DS', 'Arnott', 'had', 'tough', 'go', 'having', 'once', 'been', 'rising', 'star', 'anti-terrorism', 'unit', 'mistake', 'game', 'Anti-Corruption', 'may', 'be', 'ticket', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'so', 'pulled', 'Gates', 'circle', 'looking', 'edge', 'will', 'help', 'AC', 'bring', 'down', 'man', 'so', 'perfect', 'mix', 'DC', 'Fleming', 'lone', 'female', 'Gates', 'squad', 'help', 'department', 'numbers', 'look', 'better', 'determined', 'cop', 'herself.Line', 'Duty', ""n't"", 'always', 'most', 'gripping', 'shows', 'time', 'tensest', 'thrillers', 'start', 'finish', 'What', 'well', 'give', 'story', 'got', 'few', 'twists', 'time', 'start', 'get', 'comfortable', 'make', 'feel', 'something', 'characters', 'only', 'five', 'one', 'hour', 'get', 'right', 'writers', 'make', 'second', 'count', 'story', 'arc', 'connect', 'way', 'greater', 'whole', 'up', 'final', 'heart-pounding', 'moments', ""'ll"", 'love', 'loath', 'character', 'turn', 'right', 'very', 'end', 'casting', 'Line', 'Duty', 'superb', 'filled', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'other', 'British', 'dramas', 'who', 'play', 'parts', 'gusto', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'feel', ""'re"", 'inundated', 'too', 'much', 'cop', 'action', 'fact', 'police', 'investigating', 'other', 'police', 'actually', 'set', 'show', 'apart', 'other', 'cop', 'dramas', 'only', 'problem', 'may', 'be', 'times', 'plot', 'little', 'off', 'rails', 'slightly', 'unbelievable', ""'re"", 'fan', 'British', 'drama', 'keep', 'real', 'mean', 'inclusion', 'drugs', 'swearing', 'violence', 'instead', 'light', 'humorous', 'particularly', 'investigative', 'kind', 'drama', 'check', 'one', 'out']","LINE OF DUTY, SERIES 1"

Corn ""reviewer""","[0, 0]","If you like shows like Law and Order, generally moving at a brisk pace and neatly concluded in an hour,  you might not have the patience for Line of Duty. Sticking with all 5 episodes requires not only a major time commitment but an interest in the characters. I watched the entire series during a record snow storm. Along the way, I went from thinking this might be just a mildly diverting way to pass the time to deciding it was definitely rewarding.Creator Jed Mercurio wanted to create a  realistic ""behind the scenes"" look at police work, complete with ambition, conspiracies, and mistrust in the department (he revealed this goal in the bonus features included with the DVD set). As a result, there  are often no clear lines between  "" good"" cops and "" bad"" ones. Even the best frequently find themselves making significant compromises that make it difficult to maintain the highest ideals.Some might be put off by this. But I found Line of Duty's portrayal of police work far more interesting than the less complicated police shows which move at a brisk clip. They're too formulaic for my taste.Two men stand out in Line of Duty. They are internal affairs officer Steve Arnott and chief inspector Tony Gates. Arnott is determined to discover the secrets behind the heroic image Gates presents to the world. Along the way, plot twists abound, too many to describe here. Seemingly unrelated events turn out to be connected down the line. If one doesn't pay close attention, those connections might slip by. .There are some plot developments that do seem a bit hard to swallow. Those keep me from giving Line of Duty a full 5 stars. But the episodes are still very watchable and thought-provoking. I don't want to dissuade anyone from viewing them because of some plot bobbles here and there.",4,"Complex, intriguing  plot but it was primarily the characters which kept me watching",1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,1796,"['like', 'shows', 'Law', 'Order', 'generally', 'moving', 'brisk', 'pace', 'neatly', 'concluded', 'hour', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'patience', 'Line', 'Duty', 'Sticking', '5', 'episodes', 'not', 'only', 'major', 'time', 'commitment', 'interest', 'characters', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'record', 'snow', 'storm', 'way', 'went', 'thinking', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'mildly', 'diverting', 'way', 'pass', 'time', 'deciding', 'was', 'definitely', 'rewarding.Creator', 'Jed', 'Mercurio', 'wanted', 'create', 'realistic', 'scenes', 'look', 'police', 'work', 'complete', 'ambition', 'conspiracies', 'mistrust', 'department', 'revealed', 'goal', 'bonus', 'features', 'included', 'DVD', 'set', 'result', 'are', 'often', 'clear', 'lines', 'good', 'cops', 'bad', 'ones', 'Even', 'best', 'frequently', 'find', 'making', 'significant', 'compromises', 'make', 'difficult', 'maintain', 'highest', 'ideals.Some', 'might', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'found', 'Line', 'Duty', 'portrayal', 'police', 'work', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'less', 'complicated', 'police', 'shows', 'move', 'brisk', 'clip', ""'re"", 'too', 'formulaic', 'taste.Two', 'men', 'stand', 'out', 'Line', 'Duty', 'are', 'internal', 'affairs', 'officer', 'Steve', 'Arnott', 'chief', 'inspector', 'Tony', 'Gates', 'Arnott', 'determined', 'discover', 'secrets', 'heroic', 'image', 'presents', 'world', 'way', 'plot', 'twists', 'abound', 'too', 'many', 'describe', 'here', 'Seemingly', 'unrelated', 'events', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'connected', 'line', 'one', ""n't"", 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'connections', 'might', 'slip', 'are', 'plot', 'developments', 'do', 'seem', 'bit', 'hard', 'swallow', 'keep', 'giving', 'Line', 'Duty', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'watchable', 'thought-provoking', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'dissuade', 'anyone', 'viewing', 'plot', 'bobbles', 'here', 'there']","LINE OF DUTY, SERIES 1"
1654192,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00D7AM2YW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[28, 29]","Every once in a while, you discover a series that really surprises you.  For me, the five part British police drama ""Line of Duty"" was one of those experiences.  Having seen so many films and TV shows based on a similar premise (cops coloring outside of the lines and those that would pursue them), I didn't have particularly high expectations that this could provide much new to the topic.  I just hoped it would be slick and entertaining.  From the get-go, though, this high octane procedural came out of the gate swinging and its intensity never relented.  Providing as many, if not more, plot twists and big confrontations than a regular season on traditional network TV, these five parts took me on a complete and satisfying journey.  Sure, some of the plot points stretched credibility at times.  The lead investigators on both sides are each allowed to behave incredibly unprofessionally without repercussions and the criminal plot threads get particularly convoluted.  But I didn't care due to sheer entertainment value.  In some ways, my brain is telling me that I should value this experience at 4 stars due to these slight reservations.  But I'm rounding my 4 1/2 star rating up instead for the simple reason that ""Line of Duty"" so supremely exceeded my expectations.At the beginning of ""Line of Duty,"" we meet Martin Compston as DS Steve Arnott.  Working with a counter-terrorism unit, a mission goes horribly awry and he is left to twist in the wind when he won't back an untruthful cover story.  This principled, though incredibly unpopular, stand leads to an appointment in the British equivalent of Internal Affairs.  His attention is focused on the city's most decorated officer, DCI Tony Gates (played with great swagger by Lennie James).  James' successful stats are especially high and he works a team with seeming autonomy.  The other lead is the ambitious DC Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure) who appears to have an agenda of  her own.  A series of brutal murders rock the drug world and a random hit and run with a car reported stolen figure prominently in early episodes.  Although married, James is involved in an affair with a wealthy entrepreneur (the reliable Gina McKee).  On closer inspection, she might be involved in some unpleasant dealings of her own.  I won't reveal any major plot points.  Suffice it to say, all of the disparate plot threads intertwine with efficiency and James is in the middle of it all.  As James and Compston square off repeatedly, maybe the bigger crimes will devour them both.""Line of Duty"" is gritty, fast paced, and holds plenty of surprises.  Each episode ends with a pretty significant cliffhanger and the finale wraps things up with precision.  There is quite a bit of violence in ""Line of Duty"" and much of it caught me unaware.  In dramas of this kind, I always feel that I know exactly where the story is headed.  Here, I felt slightly more uncertain.  Compston, with his puppy dog looks and big eyebrows, has a quiet intensity that works.  As he is pushed to extremes, it could sometimes become a little too one note.  McClure navigates a difficult role (note: I didn't say much about her, that's for you to find out) effectively and believably.  And the supporting cast is nicely drawn and memorable.  From the street toughs to the front line officers, the smaller roles had surprising depth and dimension which helped distinguish this piece immensely.  And then there is James.  A great character actor who has been in almost everything (currently a lead on AMC's new Low Winter Sun), James is absolutely magnetic.  A real antihero whom you don't know whether you should root for or despise, he will definitely keep you guessing.  ""Line of Duty"" may not necessarily be the best show I've seen this year, but it is easily one of the most entertaining.

But, like peeking into the vanity closet in a new acquaintance's powder room and discovering a whole lot of tubes of some pretty unsettling ointments, it rapidly becomes clear the renowned and respected Chief Inspector has been screwing around with appreciably more than crime statistics. Comprised of five episodes spanning two disks, the serialized drama hastily progressed to a somewhat equivocal conclusion. The second disk also includes a bonus features section that I had no motivation to watch.&lt;End of short attention span review>My curiosity was sparked when I noticed Lennie James, who I liked in his featured role as a brooding, mysterious and secretive operative in the abbreviated post-apocalyptic U.S. drama Jericho, appeared to be the lead actor. After this outing, I'm going to have to look for other programs where he has a significant part because based on his performance here there's little indication his range is all that expansive although neither the plotting nor dialogue gave him much of a shot.Also playing a major role here is actress Vicky McClure who might not be a Helen Mirren but she has impressed me as a curvier, more emotive Courteney Cox, which is a good thing.

The only cloud in Gates's sky is his extra-marital relationship with a cunning businesswoman, a relationship from which Gates tries to extricate himself. But the woman is loath to let him go, and not simply for reasons of love. She has invested her body and money to cultivate a relationship with someone in law enforcement who can do her favors, and she means to get a return on her investment. You know Gates's relationship with this woman is going to prove to be a big problem and that his efforts to deal with her likely will pull him into deeper water. The setup to this point is promising and plausible. And, then, for me, plausibility was jettisoned. [spoiler alert!] The girlfriend is killed in Gates's presence by masked thugs who knock Gates unconscious, press a knife into his hand to get his fingerprints on it, and cart her body away to be refrigerated against the day it, and the knife, will be turned over to police if Gates doesn't do the bidding of the mysterious criminal mastermind behind all this, who gives Gates orders over cell phones conveyed to Gates by a mouthy, adolescent hoodlum on a bicycle. (No, I'm not making this up.) In the meantime, the equivalent of Internal Affairs begins investigating Gates's connection to his girlfriend, now missing. Between that investigation and the demands of the mysterious criminal mastermind, Gates soon finds himself pushed to increasingly desperate measures to keep his universe from collapsing in on him. What's a guy to do? I didn't really care. There's graphic violence and heaping doses of cynicism (there's no one among the police rank and file who would snitch on criminal behavior in their ranks, and there's no one in police leadership who's not a politician first and a police officer second).

The involvement of the main character in an investigation for corruption.  The involvement of supporting characters in a love-him or hate-him skirmish.  I mean, can we get some new material here?  Second, the acting is hit and miss.  Sure, some of the acting is competent and intriguing.  Three of the main characters are good and the actors are talented, given the over-the-top screenplay.  But Luther's characters and acting is just better.  And more convincing.  Ultimately, even within watching the series (and not merely reflecting on it afterwards) I find myself asking why make this series in the first place?

It is violent, prepare yourself. Not much to smile about in these five episodes.The series starts off with a terrorist case that was bungled by the police, and a cover-up is underway. Except DS Arnott, played by, Martin Compston, one of the bunglers won't play and wants to tell the truth. He is transferred to A-12,  the Corruption Unit. This is not a popular unit, investigating your own.  DS Arnott , as it turns out has an 'off' and 'on' personality, sometimes he is with his team, and sometimes he is not. What he does have is a brilliant investigative mind, and a good boss, DCI Hastings. Hastings is after DCI Tony Gates, he believes what is purported to be all good, is in fact a method of inventing statistics and cases to make Gates look good. His mission is to bring Gates down, and it doesn't take much. However, to get there takes five harrowing episodes, blood and gore, manipulation, police cover- ups, and a great deal of  disbelief. As I said, this is really dark, you will need to take some breaks. Prepare.Lennie James as Tony Gates is superb, we watch him manipulate us right before our eyes. Gina McGee, as Jackie, Gates lover, is the perfect mistress , Vicky McLure, plays Kate, the officer undercover who plays up to Gates, is in a position to find the truth, and she never wavers, ever! DS Arnott, has the series play around his investigation, however, his wishy-washy character takes away from his performance. This series is true grit, what we believe may really occur in the real world of policing in the UK.  Series Two has been given a green light by BBC2, look forward to the next session.

1654207,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B00D7AM2YW,Richard B. Schwartz,"[0, 0]","This is wonderful stuff, but not for the faint of heart.  DCI Tony Gates (Lennie James) has just received an officer-of-the-year award for his closing of cases.  The AC (anti-corruption) unit is skeptical.  Has Tony been laddering (i.e. multiplying the charges with each case so that the closure numbers skew skyward)?This is the least of Tony&#8217;s problems.  A happily-married man with two daughters on whom he dotes, Tony is irresistibly drawn to a wealthy woman who lusts after him (and the good he can do her within the force).  She is corrupt, a property owner/manager in league with a drug ring which uses her properties to launder money.  Tony is investigating a triple murder involving rival dealers and has not yet seen that all of these activities are connected and all, ultimately, involve him.And herein lies the drama.  We have a great copper who is also a human being, drawn into a circle of corruption by his human inclinations, but protective of his honor, integrity and, in particular, his family.  The AC unit (cf. &#8216;internal affairs&#8217; in the U.S.) is hounding him; the villains are hounding him; he is tormented by his complicity in crime but determined to do the right thing and close the case, even if this will come at a significant cost.Thus, the story concerns honor and ultimately very few individuals in the force and in the world that they investigate possess it or value it.  The corruption, finally, is omnipresent.The writing and pacing are superb.  This is riveting, personal drama along with gruesome and gritty action.  The villains&#8217; trademark, e.g., is the severing of fingers with a set of bolt cutters and a little dismemberment of full bodies causes them little loss of sleep.  They are hateful to the core and the shadowy presence that directs their activities (&#8220;Tommy&#8221;) is a disembodied voice on a series of burner cellphones.Nearly all of the principal characters are compromised in some way and their attempt to do the right thing while wallowing in a cesspit of corruption makes for heartbreaking drama.This is all exacerbated by the nature of contemporary British policing.

1654209,A2UYGOYMV73826,B00D7AM2YW,Rushmore,"[0, 0]","This series feels a lot like classic Greek tragedy to me with its themes of hubris, revenge and sacrifice.  We begin with Tony Gates getting the Officer of the Year award.  Although he is getting an awful lot of hype and we don't know much about him at this point, he seems like a pretty good guy.  We also see a horribly botched counter-terrorism operation, resulting in the death of an innocent man.  When Steve Arnott, the officer giving the orders at the counter-terrorism op, refuses to shade the truth about errors that were made, he is moved to the anti-corruption unit AC-12.  The target of their new investigation is none other than the Officer of the Year Tony Gates.The overriding motif in this series is covering up the truth.  Initially the thrust of the investigation against Tony is laddering, or piling on additional charges to every crime to enhance the conviction rate.  Tony's team are hard workers and seem to worship their boss.  Initially the investigation seems sort of petty.  But Tony has dark secrets.  His mistress Jackie gets in some bad trouble and Tony covers it up.  As more and more pressure is brought to bear on Tony from all sides, we see that some members of his team are not all that loyal - notably Kate who joins Tony's team but in truth is working on the anti-corruption investigation against him.There are lots of characters in this show, and they are all flawed in some way.  Initially Tony thinks he can have everything his way because he is simply the greatest.  As the chinks in his armor start to show, he becomes increasingly desperate.  Steve is way too eager to redeem himself and not the smoothest negotiator.  Kate is a pretty cool customer.  She's hard to read but ultimately her ambition might be more motivation than getting to the truth.  The performances are all good but I would single out Vicky McClure providing the most nuanced and intriguing work as Kate.This is an adult show with adult themes and a fair amount of pretty graphic violence.  The plot is complex and I will be thinking about it for some time.  I liked this show more than my spouse who kept trying to poke holes in the plot.

The problem is fitting into 1 hour episodes a concise story about solving crimes. This is more like a long movie though, with 5 hours to fit in a story that lacked plausibility but made up for it in complexity.The most compelling character in the story was Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Tony Gates, played very nicely by Lennie James. He's the most developed character. He means well but keeps getting himself in deeper and deeper trouble. The rest of the characters don't get quite as much attention because the focus is on the crimes being solved and on the destruction of DCI Gates.I think they tried to develop Detective Sergeant Arnott, but he just wasn't actually that interesting except in how he dealt with DSI Gates.It twists, it turns.

1654216,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00D7AM2YW,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 1]","LINE OF DUTY. This British  television series,  an intriguing crime drama, is a BBC production. Lives and reputations are at risk  in this high-stakes  thriller. DCI Tony Gates seems like an exemplary cop. But Superintendent Ted Hastings,  who heads the anticorruption unit, wonders. Is Gates really that good? He&#8217;s got the best crime stats on the force, and a top team working under him.  But is he really that clean?  The police procedural, created and written by Jed Mercurio, filmed in little-seen Birmingham, comes as a box set, 5 episodes, 305 minutes, full color, on 2 DVDs.  With interviews with the writer, directors, and cast members, and subtitles, thank you Acorn/RLJ.  For mature audiences only.Now, if you&#8217;ll forgive me, I am going to run the plot summary of this British mystery given by its makers, World Productions, to IMDb.  &#8220;Following one multi-stranded investigation over five hours, Line Of Duty sees Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott (Martin Compston) transferred to AC-12, a fictional anti-corruption unit, after a mistaken shooting during a counter-terrorist operation. Alongside Detective Constable Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure), they are assigned to lead an investigation into the alleged corruption by a popular and successful officer, Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates (Lennie James). While Gates cleverly manipulates his unit's figures, DS Arnott questions whether Gates is being made a scapegoat for a culture of institutionalised [sic] spin, or is guilty of darker corruption?&#8221;The episodes are as follows:Disc 1Episode 1DS Steve Arnott, (Martin Compston, MONARCH OF THE GLEN),  is thrilled to be joining the anticorruption unit after his disgraced performance in the anti-terrorism unit, during which an innocent man was killed.  That is,  he&#8217;s thrilled until he learns the target of his first investigation is to be the esteemed and respected DCI Tony Gates, (Lennie James, THE WALKING DEAD).  Arnott&#8217;s boss, Ted Hastings, insists the investigation must go on: perhaps a look into Gates&#8217; private life will prove fruitful.Episode 2New team member DC Kate Fleming, (Vicky McClure, BROADCHURCH), wins Gates&#8217; trust, then begins to pay close attention to his work. As he scrambles to cover his tracks, Gates fears he is about to lose the two most important things in his life&#8212;his job and his family.Episode 3Gates witnesses  a murder,  realizes he is being ensnared into a corrupt world. Meanwhile, an increasingly confrontational Arnott, determined to bring the higher-ranking officer down, closes in on him, throwing caution to the wind; then walks away from the case in a state of angry depression.Disc 2Episode 4Arnott may be off the case,  but Fleming continues to play on her relationship with her supposed boss. In so doing, she brings on herself the attentions&#8212;and suspicions&#8212;of Gates&#8217;s loyal lieutenant, DC Morton.Episode 5Tensions erupt between Hastings, Arnott, and Fleming as they decide on the case&#8217;s next steps. Gates. who is unwilling to passively await his fate,  goes on the run.Also playing prominent parts in this  thriller are the now reliable veteran Adrian Dunbar, ASHES TO ASHES,  as Hastings, chief of the anti-corruption unit, and Gina McKee, THE FORSYTE SAGA, as Jacqueline Laverty, property developer, Gates&#8217; bit on the side.

The corrected review is below.There are already a number of reviews of the brilliantly written, acted and directed thriller here on Amazon - quite a few with more detail than I think necessary for you to enjoy it  - and so I hope to provide you with enough info to understand the show but don't look for me to give any ""spoilers"". This review is based on the DVD version, which contains ""bonus features"" not on the Amazon Instant version. (Additional note: While I review many DVDs here on Amazon - including quite a few BBC dramas from Acorn, this title was sent to me by Amazon under their Vine Reviewer program)""Line of Duty"" is a five-episode mini-series that aired on the BBC in 2012. Each of the episodes runs 61 minutes. This is not a mystery series (the crime that starts it all takes place in the first 10 minutes of the first episode and the viewer knows the culprit. This is a police procedure show, and one with thrilling action. (I'll stop here for a moment to say that there are graphic violence moments here stronger than I ever remember in a TV series (cable or not), and viewers should be aware of this, though the script and acting make it worth watching. The cast will be mostly unknown to American viewers, though one of the characters - DC Nigel Morton - is played by Neil Morrissey,  a veteran British comedian, here making his first dramatic role.The David has a wealth of ""bonus features"" - which you should only watch after you have seen the show (which is the first in a continuing series). There are eight ""Q&A; Interviews"" with the lead actors as well as the Writer/Producer and each of the two Directors (one directed the first three episode; another directed the last two - though I didn't notice much difference.) These total 47 minutes. The other ""bonus"" is 10 minutes of ""behind-the-scenes footage"" which consists of raw footage of certain scenes without any amplified dialogue.There is an ""English Subtitles"" option which may be helpful for those not used to varying British accents.Well there you have it. The basics you need to begin watching this exciting series; one of the best from the Acorn catalog.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Review of the DVD and Bonus Features of this SUPERB Thriller - NO spoilers in this review,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,2353,"['NOTE', 'revised', 'details', 'review', '2/18/14', 'when', 'reader', 'pointed', 'out', 'confused', 'name', 'one', 'actors', 'corrected', 'review', 'below.There', 'are', 'already', 'number', 'reviews', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'acted', 'directed', 'thriller', 'here', 'Amazon', 'quite', 'few', 'more', 'detail', 'think', 'necessary', 'enjoy', 'so', 'hope', 'provide', 'enough', 'info', 'understand', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'give', 'spoilers', 'review', 'based', 'DVD', 'version', 'bonus', 'features', 'not', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'version', 'Additional', 'note', 'review', 'many', 'DVDs', 'here', 'Amazon', 'including', 'few', 'BBC', 'dramas', 'Acorn', 'title', 'was', 'sent', 'Amazon', 'Vine', 'Reviewer', 'program', 'Line', 'Duty', 'five-episode', 'mini-series', 'aired', 'BBC', '2012', 'episodes', '61', 'minutes', 'not', 'mystery', 'series', 'crime', 'place', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'first', 'episode', 'viewer', 'culprit', 'police', 'procedure', 'show', 'one', 'thrilling', 'action', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'here', 'moment', 'say', 'are', 'graphic', 'violence', 'moments', 'here', 'stronger', 'ever', 'remember', 'TV', 'series', 'cable', 'not', 'viewers', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'script', 'acting', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'cast', 'will', 'be', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'American', 'viewers', 'one', 'characters', 'DC', 'Nigel', 'Morton', 'played', 'Neil', 'Morrissey', 'veteran', 'British', 'comedian', 'here', 'making', 'first', 'dramatic', 'role.The', 'David', 'wealth', 'bonus', 'features', 'should', 'only', 'watch', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'first', 'continuing', 'series', 'are', 'eight', 'Q', 'A', 'Interviews', 'lead', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'Writer/Producer', 'two', 'Directors', 'one', 'directed', 'first', 'three', 'episode', 'directed', 'last', 'two', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'much', 'difference', 'total', '47', 'minutes', 'other', 'bonus', '10', 'minutes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'footage', 'raw', 'footage', 'certain', 'scenes', 'amplified', 'dialogue.There', 'English', 'Subtitles', 'option', 'may', 'be', 'helpful', 'not', 'used', 'varying', 'British', 'accents.Well', 'there', 'have', 'basics', 'need', 'begin', 'watching', 'exciting', 'series', 'one', 'best', 'Acorn', 'catalog.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']","LINE OF DUTY, SERIES 1"

1654219,A2WW57XX2UVLM6,B00D7AM2YW,Talvi,"[0, 0]","Line of Duty series one includes five 60-minute episodes of this British thriller (now commissioned for a second season). There is murder, torture, and a lot of unpleasantness as a bunch of crime-related subplots begin to weave together in a tightly plotted overall story arc that keeps you guessing.I really enjoyed The Forsyte Saga, and recognized Gina McKee. She was luminous but cold in that series, someone you sympathized with but couldn't empathize with. In Line of Duty she plays Jackie Laverty, a woman who uses her sexuality to manipulate her lover.I also recognized Lennie James from The State Within (fantastic, suspenseful UK mini-series with Jason Isaacs) as well as from the US series Jericho (starring Skeet Ulrich). Lennie James is a scene-stealer in everything he's in, including this. I find him riveting, though I swing from liking him to disliking him and back. I consider that the sign of a good actor.Line of Duty is not action-packed. It's a drama, and it feels very real. You find yourself puzzling things out alongside the detectives as they work through several different criminal investigations. And just when you start going with the flow, the series throws in another surprise twist.Although brutal at times, there is a good deal of suspense as the main characters weave an intricate trail of lies and deception.  You watch one of the detectives dig himself a deeper and deeper hole and you gradually become more certain that he will never be able to dig himself out.  Still, I was so impressed with the surprises woven in as the story progressed that even then I didn't count on his fate being sealed.Fans of The Fall or Spooks might enjoy this procedural drama. It's all about wending your way through the individual investigations and finding your way to the overall story arc via the subtle clues dropped throughout.  Yes, there are some areas where credibility will be stretched (a detective being caught out lying during an inquiry as well as running an investigation when he's involved with the victim but not getting suspended) - but in all, well worth the watch.One side note - if you don't like what my sister refers to as ""shakes the cameraman"" photography, you won't like this.

More in line what the mini-series format that has been popular in the U.S.A. over time (for example, Roots, the Hatfields and the McCoys, etc.)  Working with a much shorter timeline to fill seems to help the U.K. productions keep up their quality while still giving them more than a typical U.S.A. made for TV movie would have available.  While I might not like that these series seem to end just as quickly as they start, I do appreciate that they do a great job of telling the story they are intended to tell.In the case of Line of Duty: Series 1, the story they have to tell starts fairly quickly and by the end of the first episode you'll likely find yourself engrossed in the story, ready to jump right into the second episode.  What you find in that watching is that appearances are incredibly deceiving.  While viewers initially may be lead to believe that we're going to be watching an in carriage of justice, perhaps we shouldn't rush to such quick judgment.  By the end of the 3rd episode we'll be absolutely hooked as we ride along with the twists and turns that are playing out on the screen.Viewers should be warned that there are more than a few scenes that are violent and disturbing.  This isn't a series for the squeamish among us.  Giving away details in that area would be ruinous to the enjoyment of watching the series play out, so I'm trying to avoid the spoilers that might otherwise slip through here.  I would just note that as wife 2.0 and I watched it was difficult to get through at least one torturous scene and we both found ourselves fairly well shocked more than a few other times as well.I'd like to have seen this on Blu-ray rather than on upconverted DVD playback, but I don't think the picture quality on the DVD discs (2 in the package) was bad at all.  5 episodes total, 3 on the first disc, 2 on the second.  Bonus material (interviews with the cast, writer, directors, etc.) adds nearly an hour of additional material to the package.NOT RATED.  Were this material rated, I would expect at least a warning for the violence*, and perhaps one for sexual content.  I don't think there was much objectionable language.  U.S.A. viewers may find the dialogue a little difficult to adjust to due to the U.K. accents, but it isn't that hard to understand.  SDH subtitles are also available and may assist viewers in understanding the dialogue in some cases.(*While un-rated, the package does indicate that the material does contain coarse language and disturbing images)",4,Quality shines through,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,2849,"['One', 'things', 'like', 'even', 'find', 'little', 'frustrating', 'times', 'U.K.', 'programming', 'rather', 'straining', 'stretching', 'make', 'series', 'work', 'longer', 'season', 'such', 'happens', 'U.S.A.', 'productions', 'instead', 'concentrate', 'quality', 'typically', 'plan', 'out', 'season', 'series', 'much', 'smaller', 'number', 'episodes', 'More', 'line', 'what', 'mini-series', 'format', 'been', 'popular', 'U.S.A.', 'time', 'example', 'Roots', 'Hatfields', 'McCoys', 'etc', 'Working', 'much', 'shorter', 'timeline', 'fill', 'help', 'U.K.', 'productions', 'keep', 'up', 'quality', 'still', 'giving', 'more', 'typical', 'U.S.A.', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'available', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'series', 'seem', 'end', 'just', 'as', 'quickly', 'start', 'do', 'appreciate', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'are', 'intended', 'tell.In', 'case', 'Line', 'Duty', 'Series', '1', 'story', 'have', 'tell', 'starts', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'end', 'first', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'find', 'engrossed', 'story', 'ready', 'jump', 'right', 'second', 'episode', 'What', 'find', 'watching', 'appearances', 'are', 'incredibly', 'deceiving', 'viewers', 'initially', 'may', 'be', 'lead', 'believe', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'watching', 'carriage', 'justice', 'perhaps', 'should', ""n't"", 'rush', 'such', 'quick', 'judgment', 'end', '3rd', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'be', 'absolutely', 'hooked', 'ride', 'along', 'twists', 'turns', 'are', 'playing', 'out', 'screen.Viewers', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'violent', 'disturbing', ""n't"", 'series', 'squeamish', 'Giving', 'away', 'details', 'area', 'would', 'be', 'ruinous', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'series', 'play', ""'m"", 'trying', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'might', 'otherwise', 'slip', 'here', 'would', 'just', 'note', 'wife', '2.0', 'watched', 'was', 'difficult', 'get', 'least', 'one', 'torturous', 'scene', 'found', 'fairly', 'well', 'shocked', 'more', 'few', 'other', 'times', 'well.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'Blu-ray', 'rather', 'upconverted', 'DVD', 'playback', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'discs', '2', 'package', 'was', 'bad', '5', 'episodes', 'total', '3', 'first', 'disc', '2', 'second', 'Bonus', 'material', 'interviews', 'cast', 'writer', 'directors', 'etc', 'nearly', 'hour', 'additional', 'material', 'package.NOT', 'RATED', 'Were', 'material', 'rated', 'would', 'expect', 'least', 'warning', 'violence*', 'perhaps', 'one', 'sexual', 'content', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'much', 'objectionable', 'language', 'U.S.A.', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'dialogue', 'little', 'difficult', 'adjust', 'due', 'U.K.', 'accents', ""n't"", 'that', 'hard', 'understand', 'SDH', 'subtitles', 'are', 'also', 'available', 'may', 'assist', 'viewers', 'understanding', 'dialogue', 'cases', '*While', 'un-rated', 'package', 'indicate', 'material', 'contain', 'coarse', 'language', 'disturbing', 'images']","LINE OF DUTY, SERIES 1"

The series focuses on Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates, who has an impeccable record solving crimes. The anti-corruption unit of the police force thinks his accomplishments are too good to be true and sets out to investigate the way he goes about getting access to the information that leads to his many arrests.A number of violent murders takes place and Gates investigates them as he is being investigated by the anti-corruption unit. As events progress, it becomes clear that no one is perfectly clean. The writers manage to create and sustain suspense by planting actual clues, red herrings, and assorted suspicions, making for clever, sharply conceived plot developments.The show is at its best revealing the inner workings of the police department, complete with its various divisions and factions within them. Characters are not painted in broad strokes of ""good"" or ""bad."" They are textured and come across as actual, flawed individuals. The police milieu allows for plenty of action and numerous story lines are intertwined artfully.Unlike many American cop shows, plots are complex and are not resolved automatically within a one-hour time limit. The writers take their time, and American viewers might be a bit impatient if they're used to neat, quick ""tied up with a bow"" plot resolutions.Performances are uniformly strong.

1654222,A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I,B00D7AM2YW,Veil_Lord,"[0, 0]","First thing I have to mention, the DVDs I received didn't work in my player.  No problem with any other discs, but for whatever reason these were a no go.  I ended up having to watch on my laptop which was less than thrilling.  I'm hoping I got a set with a minor defect, but just so anyone who has a similar problem knows watching it in a computer should still work.If you haven't watched many British shows, on average they tend to be better than American shows; there are plenty of arguments why, whether it's that in the US we only really get to see their good ones, if it's due to the BBC being able to give chances networks here won't take, or I'm sure everybody has their own theory; I'd argue it's at least in part because they do far fewer episodes so they have the good stuff more condensed.  This series is only 5 hours long, but they are real hours, a hair over 60 minutes each.  It's more like watching a very compelling double feature movie than a TV series.  I found myself watching the entire first disk (3 episodes) when I'd meant to only watch one.The thumbnail for the series, one man is involved in a botched counter-terrorism job, doesn't want to cover up the truth, and ends up recruited by essentially Internal Affairs.  The head of that department is targeting a hot shot detective who he thinks is a little too good, for reasons I was never quite clear on.  Purely by coincidence, at the same time that detective is cheating on his wife and begins to have a far more complicated life where he actually is starting to get a little dirty, so the probe comes at the worst possible time.  I don't want to get too far into it and spoil anything, but there's also an informant in the detective's group which adds another layer on top of things as the mole tries to push from the inside, the investigators are pushing from the outside, and this little complication in the detective's life continues to spin further out of his control.I found the acting to be generally quite good, but was sometimes confused by people's motivations seeming to turn on a dime in another direction.  It's possible it's more a cultural thing I didn't get and watching it again it will make more sense, but still those moments were few and far between.  There is a fair amount of sex, violence, and poo involved so this isn't for the kids.  It was nice that they could push things a little further into realism than you'd see on NBC.What may really make or break it for you is the ending.  I won't tell you which way it goes, but depending on whether you like happy endings where everything is neatly wrapped up with a villain's confession, dystopian endings where bad guy comes out on top in the end, or a mix of the two where things do a funky twist at the very end, you may find yourself either amused or very highly irritated by how things work out.  My advice, if you do have a problem with how it ends just ignore it.  The lead up to the ending is easily worth watching and it's not worth getting hung up on the last 15 mins of the show.",4,Compelling Drama - You'll Either Really Love Or Really Hate The Ending,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,3040,"['First', 'thing', 'have', 'mention', 'DVDs', 'received', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'player', 'problem', 'other', 'discs', 'reason', 'were', 'go', 'ended', 'up', 'having', 'watch', 'laptop', 'was', 'less', 'thrilling', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'got', 'set', 'minor', 'defect', 'just', 'so', 'anyone', 'who', 'similar', 'problem', 'watching', 'computer', 'should', 'still', 'work.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'many', 'British', 'shows', 'average', 'tend', 'be', 'better', 'American', 'shows', 'are', 'plenty', 'arguments', 'why', 'US', 'only', 'really', 'get', 'see', 'good', 'ones', 'due', 'BBC', 'being', 'able', 'give', 'chances', 'networks', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', ""'m"", 'sure', 'everybody', 'own', 'theory', ""'d"", 'argue', 'least', 'part', 'do', 'far', 'fewer', 'episodes', 'have', 'good', 'stuff', 'more', 'condensed', 'series', 'only', '5', 'hours', 'long', 'are', 'real', 'hours', 'hair', '60', 'minutes', 'more', 'watching', 'very', 'compelling', 'double', 'feature', 'movie', 'TV', 'series', 'found', 'watching', 'entire', 'first', 'disk', '3', 'episodes', 'when', ""'d"", 'meant', 'only', 'watch', 'one.The', 'thumbnail', 'series', 'one', 'man', 'involved', 'botched', 'counter-terrorism', 'job', ""n't"", 'want', 'cover', 'up', 'truth', 'up', 'recruited', 'essentially', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'head', 'department', 'targeting', 'hot', 'shot', 'detective', 'who', 'little', 'too', 'good', 'reasons', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'clear', 'Purely', 'coincidence', 'same', 'time', 'detective', 'cheating', 'wife', 'have', 'far', 'more', 'complicated', 'life', 'where', 'actually', 'starting', 'get', 'little', 'dirty', 'probe', 'worst', 'possible', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'too', 'far', 'spoil', 'anything', 'also', 'informant', 'detective', 'group', 'layer', 'top', 'things', 'mole', 'push', 'inside', 'investigators', 'are', 'pushing', 'outside', 'little', 'complication', 'detective', 'life', 'spin', 'further', 'control.I', 'found', 'acting', 'be', 'generally', 'quite', 'good', 'was', 'sometimes', 'confused', 'people', 'motivations', 'seeming', 'turn', 'dime', 'direction', 'possible', 'more', 'cultural', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'watching', 'again', 'will', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'still', 'moments', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'fair', 'amount', 'sex', 'violence', 'poo', 'involved', 'so', ""n't"", 'kids', 'was', 'nice', 'could', 'push', 'things', 'little', 'further', 'realism', ""'d"", 'see', 'NBC.What', 'may', 'really', 'make', 'break', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'way', 'depending', 'happy', 'endings', 'where', 'everything', 'neatly', 'wrapped', 'up', 'villain', 'confession', 'dystopian', 'endings', 'where', 'bad', 'guy', 'out', 'top', 'end', 'mix', 'two', 'where', 'things', 'do', 'funky', 'twist', 'very', 'end', 'may', 'find', 'amused', 'very', 'highly', 'irritated', 'how', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'My', 'advice', 'do', 'have', 'problem', 'how', 'just', 'ignore', 'lead', 'up', 'ending', 'easily', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'worth', 'getting', 'hung', 'up', 'last', '15', 'mins', 'show']","LINE OF DUTY, SERIES 1"

Each of the five episodes concludes with an appropriate cliff hanger. It's not for those who might be squeamish about finger amputation, but American audiences will find the amount of violence to be within their norm. What the storyline lacks in plausibility, it makes up for in its patient and insightful exploration of DCI Tony Gates's excruciating moral dilemmas, which lead an essentially good man to sacrifice at least some of his most cherished values. In this series that probes race issues with an admirably light hand, there is very little black and white; loads of gray. Gates's development as a character--and the magnificent acting of Lennie James--make each episode worth watching, even though the whole is something of a knock-off of &#34;Luther&#34; (and James doesn't have the charisma or star power of Idris Elba).

While the basic elements of the story might not be completely original, the storytelling, direction and particularly the acting of Lennie James (&#34;The Walking Dead&#34;) as Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates. Sometimes craft trumps originality and, while the elements may be familiar, the execution provides enough twists and turns to keep the series interesting at all times. As with &#34;Luther&#34;, Gates is a complex individual not entirely pure but of pure intent. Gates knows he's the good guy but he also knows that he has to, sometimes, take short cuts to get the results he wants.SPOILERS:Pursued by the anti-corruption unit, Gates has an unusually high conviction rate which the head of the unit believes Gates is achieving by using &#34;laddering&#34; i.e., inflating the crimes those he arrests. Unfortunately for Gates that might not be the worst of his indiscretions--he carried on an affair with a woman who had a connection with a crime boss and this puts the married Gates at risk as he tries to protect her.END OF SPOILERS:The DVD looks quite nice with a very good transfer. Audio remains clear but for those that can't understand the audio subtitles are available.The only special features are an excellent 47 minute series of interviews with cast, crew, the writer/producer Jed Mercurio and the directors of the series.

1654226,A2PK1GE7ESGIQP,B00D7AM2YW,Where is my package anyway?,"[0, 0]","BOTTOM LINE: Worth it to see an excellent performance by Lennie James but series may not be what you expect.Lennie James as Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates may bring many viewers to Line of Duty but unfortunately he is featured less in the series than he is on the DVD cover art. Viewers spend a lot of time with the other two cast members in the image, Martin Compston and Vicky McClure, and their characters are easy to dislike. A lot.Similarly, only at the beginning and end of the series do you get to see Gates be as dynamic and clever as one would assume he would have to be to warrant so much attention from the forces focused on him. Most of the rest of the time viewers may wonder how a seasoned cop could have so little instinct about so much that so many people get to take a bite out of him. Sometimes fewer episodes along with the longer running time works out well for BBC dramas because each episode is so richly packed. This time the limit works against the series because it feels like so much of the story is missing.Line of Duty series 1 is worth picking up just for James' deep performance but it would have been more enjoyable if the character he was given to play was as good, bad, brilliant or all of the above as one might have hoped and expected.
