It was not entertaining at all, acting was fair in some places, plot is typical for this kind of movie. I don't like it. Come on every civilian made like so many head shots compare to the Swat team in the end of the movie which made none lol. Even when people have no ammo left, it was looking so ridiculous. Similar to other movies. The last zombie wave and gunshots were pathetic. I was counting minutes til the titles would be rolling. Verdict: No satisfaction from the movie, plain waste of time. What about the bunch of teenagers in this boring, bad movie(as the main characters)? They are not quite good at acting.

972786,AF342RETPCOK7,B000EHQ7YW,Adam Lambert,"[4, 10]",I must say I was very happy when this movie came out on dvd I saw it on sci-fi and I loved it. Don't get me wrong this does not compare to the first two return of the living dead films but is still a good movie. But I must say I liked it better than part three. Part three didn't have enough zombies but it was still a decent movie. this film has a slow start but once it gets going it is half way decent. My only complaint is this movie was suppose to be like the first two but it wasn't a hundred percent. First off the zombies in return of the living dead part one and two ran so that was like their trademark (Not to mention eating only brains this one doesn't do that). Also I was hoping to see zombies come out of the ground with the trioxin mist going throughout the cemetary. To me that is what made the first two so cool. But despite those minor flaws this is still a good movie. I actually give this movie a four and a half star rating. But of course cdnow doesn't give half ratings so I gave it four stars. The zombies in this movie I thought were cool though I thought the old man bum zombie was cool. I also liked the scene with the rat. The characters were good too I liked the Carlos character I thought he was kind of funny. The story was moreless a continuation of part three where they were trying to use the zombies as weapons. But overall I thought this was a good film a nice addition to the return of the living dead series. I hope part five comes out on dvd soon I liked that one too.,4,It's not that bad!,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,1507,"['must', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'dvd', 'saw', 'sci-fi', 'loved', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'compare', 'first', 'two', 'return', 'living', 'dead', 'films', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'must', 'say', 'liked', 'better', 'part', 'three', 'Part', 'three', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'zombies', 'was', 'still', 'decent', 'movie', 'film', 'slow', 'start', 'once', 'going', 'half', 'way', 'decent', 'only', 'complaint', 'movie', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'first', 'two', 'was', ""n't"", 'hundred', 'percent', 'First', 'zombies', 'return', 'living', 'dead', 'part', 'one', 'two', 'ran', 'so', 'was', 'trademark', 'Not', 'mention', 'eating', 'only', 'one', ""n't"", 'do', 'Also', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'zombies', 'come', 'ground', 'trioxin', 'mist', 'going', 'cemetary', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'two', 'so', 'cool', 'minor', 'flaws', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'actually', 'give', 'movie', 'four', 'half', 'star', 'rating', 'course', 'cdnow', ""n't"", 'give', 'half', 'ratings', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'zombies', 'movie', 'thought', 'were', 'cool', 'thought', 'old', 'man', 'bum', 'zombie', 'was', 'cool', 'also', 'liked', 'scene', 'rat', 'characters', 'were', 'good', 'too', 'liked', 'Carlos', 'character', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'funny', 'story', 'was', 'moreless', 'continuation', 'part', 'three', 'where', 'were', 'trying', 'use', 'zombies', 'weapons', 'overall', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'nice', 'addition', 'return', 'living', 'dead', 'series', 'hope', 'part', 'five', 'out', 'dvd', 'soon', 'liked', 'one', 'too']",Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis

The second is my favorite movie of all time, because it was great sequel that brought back a lot of actors and comedy elements from the original. And it had awesome looking zombies. The third one had a serious plot and seemed like a thinly disguised sequel to Re-animator. And the forurth entry tries to make fun of the Resident Evil movies (And in my opnion those movies are allready a parody of themselves) were a group of teenagers must fight against zombies created by a mad scinetist. These zombies are not the buried, skeletal corpses we all know and love like in the first two entries, but a cross between zombies and cyborgs. And to make it worse, the zombies can be easily killed by a braking the neck. Come on, that dosen't even work on Romero's zombies! Seems like all the recent sequels of the great horror flicks of the 80's sucks.

972790,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000EHQ7YW,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[48, 56]","I remember watching the original Return of the Living Dead in 1985. That zombie movie played on the premise that Night of the Living Dead actually happened. It was a great twist and interesting idea. The zombies in that film weren't shambling and dumb like the one's in Romero's film. Instead these zombies were pretty quick and could talk and formulate plans and traps. Also these zombies couldn't be killed by destroying the brain. It was the birth of the superzombies and it made for a fun experience. One thing it also had was a nice dose of comedy mixed in with the horror.A few years later they had a sequel to Return of the Living Dead that was a good second helping. Nothing to write home about but it was a fun gory flick. Then came a second sequel which dropped the comedy and instead tried to be Romeo and Juliet meets brain-eating zombies. Other than the usual gore and bloodsplatter this second sequel was an utter failure. It took over 10 years for someone to try making a couple more sequels, but sure enough someone found a way to do it. They even found a good enough director in Ellory Elkayem (he directed the fun, campy giant spider monster flick Eight-Legged Freaks). There was talk that this third sequel will return the ROTLD franchise back to its roots of horror mixed with comedy. I was stoked about the news. Then when it came time to see Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis, I found out that it was going to go direct-to-cable. This usually means bad news all around about the overall quality of the finished film, but I was still going to give it a chance.I finally saw its premiere on Sci-Fi channel in 2005 and all my low expectations weren't even reached by the what I saw on the TV. The movie starts off well enough and right from the get-go they don't hide the fact that the film is taking place in some Eastern European country. Peter Coyote the --- only actor with any sort of talent --- makes his appearance in this scene and there's not even any attempt to make his character abit mysterious of whether he's a good guy or a bad guy. Coyote's scientist role in the film screams evil mad scientist. The rest of the cast seemed like it was randomly picked from a college campus and from the streets of Romania. The dialogue was bad enough but having them read out loud by amateurs just made it all worse.The whole premise of the film outside of reintroducing newcomers to the zombifying effects of Trioxin seemed like the writers were trying to emulate Resident Evil instead of Return of the Living Dead. There's the mega-corporation which deals with everything known to man and also research and develops illegal biowarfare technology like zombies armed with hi-tech weapons. Resident Evil did this better (thats not saying much) so it goes without saying that ROTLD4: Necropolis just didn't know what it wanted to be. There wasn't any of the comedy that made the first two films in the franchise so fun to watch. It looked as if they tried to make a serious zombie movie and instead it turned out to be seriously bad.Even the zombies themselves ended up being inconsistent with the zombies from the first two films. Some seemed smart enough but most were of the Romero kind which goes against everything that is ROTLD. Their feeding habits even changed from eating nothing but brains but to eating other parts of the body.And they're not indestructible anymore. Shooting these zombies in the head will drop them like a sack of bricks.There really wasn't anything fun about this sequel. I would've given it a second star if they just made the zombies right and added a higher gore-quotient. Zombie movies are suppose to be dumb, gory fun but instead Return of the Living Dead 4: Necropolis just ends up being dumb, horrible and awful. I had alot of hope in Ellory Elkayem as an up-and-coming genre director, but cranking out this film after making such a fun one in Eight-Legged Freaks is a mystery and saddening. I wouldn't recommend this film as a rental on dvd. Just go rent the original two films in the series and leave this one alone.",1,Everything about this ROTLD sequel went wrong on every level,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,4078,"['remember', 'watching', 'original', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', '1985', 'zombie', 'movie', 'played', 'premise', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'actually', 'happened', 'was', 'great', 'twist', 'interesting', 'idea', 'zombies', 'film', 'were', ""n't"", 'shambling', 'dumb', 'one', 'Romero', 'film', 'Instead', 'zombies', 'were', 'pretty', 'quick', 'could', 'talk', 'formulate', 'plans', 'traps', 'Also', 'zombies', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'killed', 'destroying', 'brain', 'was', 'birth', 'superzombies', 'made', 'fun', 'experience', 'One', 'thing', 'also', 'had', 'was', 'nice', 'dose', 'comedy', 'mixed', 'horror.A', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'had', 'sequel', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', 'was', 'good', 'second', 'helping', 'Nothing', 'write', 'home', 'was', 'fun', 'gory', 'flick', 'Then', 'came', 'second', 'sequel', 'dropped', 'comedy', 'instead', 'tried', 'be', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'brain-eating', 'zombies', 'Other', 'usual', 'gore', 'bloodsplatter', 'second', 'sequel', 'was', 'utter', 'failure', 'took', 'over', '10', 'years', 'someone', 'try', 'making', 'couple', 'more', 'sequels', 'sure', 'enough', 'someone', 'found', 'way', 'do', 'even', 'found', 'good', 'enough', 'director', 'Ellory', 'Elkayem', 'directed', 'fun', 'campy', 'giant', 'spider', 'monster', 'flick', 'Eight-Legged', 'Freaks', 'was', 'talk', 'third', 'sequel', 'will', 'return', 'ROTLD', 'franchise', 'back', 'roots', 'horror', 'mixed', 'comedy', 'was', 'stoked', 'news', 'Then', 'when', 'came', 'time', 'see', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', '4', 'Necropolis', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'direct-to-cable', 'usually', 'bad', 'news', 'overall', 'quality', 'finished', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'give', 'chance.I', 'finally', 'saw', 'premiere', 'Sci-Fi', 'channel', '2005', 'low', 'expectations', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'reached', 'what', 'saw', 'TV', 'movie', 'off', 'well', 'enough', 'right', 'get-go', 'do', ""n't"", 'hide', 'fact', 'film', 'taking', 'place', 'Eastern', 'European', 'country', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'only', 'actor', 'sort', 'talent', 'appearance', 'scene', 'not', 'even', 'attempt', 'make', 'character', 'abit', 'mysterious', 'good', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'Coyote', 'scientist', 'role', 'film', 'screams', 'evil', 'mad', 'scientist', 'rest', 'cast', 'seemed', 'was', 'randomly', 'picked', 'college', 'campus', 'streets', 'Romania', 'dialogue', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'having', 'read', 'out', 'loud', 'amateurs', 'just', 'made', 'worse.The', 'whole', 'premise', 'film', 'reintroducing', 'newcomers', 'zombifying', 'effects', 'Trioxin', 'seemed', 'writers', 'were', 'trying', 'emulate', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'instead', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', 'mega-corporation', 'everything', 'known', 'man', 'also', 'research', 'illegal', 'biowarfare', 'technology', 'zombies', 'armed', 'hi-tech', 'weapons', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'did', 'better', 'thats', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'saying', 'ROTLD4', 'Necropolis', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'wanted', 'be', 'was', ""n't"", 'comedy', 'made', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'franchise', 'so', 'fun', 'watch', 'looked', 'tried', 'make', 'serious', 'zombie', 'movie', 'instead', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'seriously', 'bad.Even', 'zombies', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'inconsistent', 'zombies', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'seemed', 'smart', 'enough', 'most', 'were', 'Romero', 'kind', 'everything', 'ROTLD', 'feeding', 'habits', 'even', 'changed', 'eating', 'nothing', 'brains', 'eating', 'other', 'parts', 'body.And', ""'re"", 'not', 'indestructible', 'anymore', 'Shooting', 'zombies', 'head', 'will', 'drop', 'sack', 'bricks.There', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'fun', 'sequel', 'would', ""'ve"", 'given', 'second', 'star', 'just', 'made', 'zombies', 'right', 'added', 'higher', 'gore-quotient', 'Zombie', 'movies', 'are', 'suppose', 'be', 'dumb', 'gory', 'fun', 'instead', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', '4', 'Necropolis', 'just', 'up', 'being', 'dumb', 'horrible', 'awful', 'had', 'alot', 'hope', 'Ellory', 'Elkayem', 'up-and-coming', 'genre', 'director', 'cranking', 'out', 'film', 'making', 'such', 'fun', 'one', 'Eight-Legged', 'Freaks', 'mystery', 'saddening', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'rental', 'dvd', 'Just', 'go', 'rent', 'original', 'two', 'films', 'series', 'leave', 'one', 'alone']",Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis

Twenty Eight Days I found slightly disappointing but it was followed by all these other more fun ones and I thought possibly this new entry to Return of the Living Dead might have been worthy of carrying on the line. `Fraid not.This rather weak effort fell short not because of lack of good make-up work or abundance of squibs. A sophomoric script lacking any humor or irony is the basic problem. This is unworthy of the Return of the Living Dead label that was so well play in versions 1, 2 and 3. They WERE funny and ironic which made the gross all that much grosser. Also, they were more liberal with the sexual content, in 1 certainly. 2, which was more like this new entry, was directly targeted at a much younger crowd. But 2 managed to generate some tension where this new one had me just waiting for the end. Fist fighting with zombies will never become fashionable. They tried to throw a couple of surprises in by leaving a couple of deadmeats alive and making a couple of, supposedly, unexpected kills but this just leaves you even more unsatisfied.

This fourth film pits a new group of teenagers against a zombie horde that has been created by a hi-tech weapons manufacturer with the intent of turning the undead into mechanical bio-weapons. The plot and characters have been streamlined down to their most basic forms, and have only been introduced as filler to pad out the run time until the inevitable zombie outbreak. Once the flood gates are opened, however, the film skates by thanks to a surprising amount of bloody gore. All of the gut-munching, head-exploding action is created in frame using practical effects, which is a welcome change from the exploited computer effects that are commonly used in such low-budget zombie efforts. The film builds up to a final anti-climactic battle between the surviving teens and the two weapon-clad undead soldiers, neither of which prove to be formidable foes against the unarmed kids. After putting aside the stock ingredients in this bland entry, the hardcore zombie fan will find just enough gore to make this one worth a watch.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",2,Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,1229,"['2005', 'rights', 'RETURN', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD', 'series', 'were', 'bought', 'up', 'shipped', 'out', 'Romania', 'two', 'back-to-back', 'video', 'releases', 'expectantly', 'poor', 'results', 'fourth', 'film', 'new', 'group', 'teenagers', 'zombie', 'horde', 'been', 'created', 'hi-tech', 'weapons', 'manufacturer', 'intent', 'turning', 'undead', 'mechanical', 'bio-weapons', 'plot', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'streamlined', 'most', 'basic', 'forms', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'introduced', 'filler', 'pad', 'out', 'run', 'time', 'inevitable', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'flood', 'gates', 'are', 'opened', 'however', 'film', 'skates', 'thanks', 'surprising', 'amount', 'bloody', 'gore', 'gut-munching', 'head-exploding', 'action', 'created', 'frame', 'using', 'practical', 'effects', 'welcome', 'change', 'exploited', 'computer', 'effects', 'are', 'commonly', 'used', 'such', 'low-budget', 'zombie', 'efforts', 'film', 'up', 'final', 'anti-climactic', 'battle', 'surviving', 'teens', 'two', 'weapon-clad', 'undead', 'soldiers', 'prove', 'be', 'formidable', 'foes', 'unarmed', 'kids', 'putting', 'aside', 'stock', 'ingredients', 'bland', 'entry', 'hardcore', 'zombie', 'fan', 'will', 'find', 'just', 'enough', 'gore', 'make', 'one', 'worth', 'watch.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis
972796,A21VGNU5959O85,B000EHQ7YW,CaterpillarGirl,"[3, 4]","There are some things that are sacred to me, and the genre of zombie films is one of them. When George Romero and John Russo the original writers of ""night of the living dead"" had a dispute over how to handle a sequel, they decided to split up and from then on Romero's Films would be known with the title ending in ""the dead"" and Russo got ""the living dead"" While still having the original film to reference. George went on to make Dawn, Day Land and the upcoming Diary of the Dead all sticking to his original zombie formula: lurching, hungry, dumb, and basically empty vessels of putridity and few words. Russo went on to write Return of the Living Dead, which he eventually gave control to Tobe Hooper who eventually gave it to Dan O'Bannon to rewrite and direct.  Return took a whole different path than the original, the zombies were juicer, they talked, were faster and more intelligent. There was no more unexplainable event that caused the dead to walk; we now had Trioxin a military made chemical used originally to get rid of marijuana plants (actually based on the chemical Agent Orange). Unlike Night of the living dead, the zombies in Return cannot be killed by a shot to the head, rendering them ""immortal"" unless blown to bits.  That film made 14 million.Return, and Return II were amusing, funny, completely different than Romero's commentary on Society in his films. They have been called ""SplatStick"" for that reason.Return II was written and directed by Ken Wiederhorn in 1988 and it followed the first even had some of the same actors and while it was no masterpiece it was still a well done film that made 9 million at the box office, and then came Return III five years later in 1993 written by John Penney and Directed by Brian Yuzna  it had little resemblance to the two before it the only plot line surviving is the use of the Trioxin. It wasn't comedic but rather a doomed love story which again redefined the zombie M.O. It was poorly shot, had terrible if not laughable special effects (I have seen better zombie masks at the dollar store) and seemed to just be one big S&M; hot mess. At this point we all got the feeling the series had lost its momentum, unlike Romero's Films which still have, pardon the pun, all the life left in them. Return 3 cost 2 million to make but it only made back 54,000.The Fourth Installment proves this series is....well dead. Necropolis, written by William Butler and Aaron Strongoni Directed by Ellory Elkayem. This installment still has the Ole Trioxin Oops, but has now made the zombies more destructible, perhaps even weaker than the Original Night of the living dead zombies. They can be killed by a few punches!! The movie is inconsistent, has poor effects, worse acting and is an affront to zombie lovers everywhere. Gone was the humor, the zombies being even slighty scary, and the continuation of the original Return. Its like they hadn't even watched the originals, but instead decided to make a lame teenage semi-medical disaster stinker. There is another film coming out soon, or has come out called ""Return of the Dead: Rave from the Grave"" egads, its about the same evil scientist played by peter coyote one year later, and now the Trioxin has been manufactured into a drug called ""Z"" and whoever takes it, turns into a zombie.

I chose to check it out and it is, next to Day of the Dead:Contagium the WORST horror remake I've ever seen and I've seen plenty! This one has more mistakes than an abortion clinic seriously. Don't even mention the horrendous acting and plot. I mean, the 1985 original ""Return of the Living Dead"" had pretty lousy acting but gosh darn it had Mr.Pathmark!!! That's a plus in my book, not to mention it's actually a GOOD movie. This is horrible in every which way, in the beginning of this flick a zombie can only be airholed by the famous shot to the head. A few zombies take body shots only to keep trudging forth. BUT all of a sudden towards the middle, they start dropping like flies when shot anywhere BUT the head. That did it for me. It just got cheesier as the movie went on and on. The ONLY reason it gets 2 stars is that the special effects are actually pretty good, pretty authentic compated to others. And there are a few scenes that showcase these efx, like a steamroller squashing a head into raspberry jam! Other than that, stick to the 4 star winners like ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Day of the Dead"" and of course the granpappy of them all, ""NIGHt of the Living Dead.""

Return of the Living Dead has to be one of the more ingenious ideas when it comes to the genre. I can say that long gone are the days of the indestructible Zombies from the films past. Now we get the Zombies that can be killed with a shot to the head. Still lets not argue these semantics and lets get down to the Nitty Gritty of the film itself.Filmed in Romania and Ukraine, the film has a natural style to it's look. It really doesn't need a whole lot in the way of sets, nor did it really have a whole lot in the way of sets. Most of what you see here is natural surroundings. The acting in the film was not half bad and the dialogue actually was not too bad either. If you are going to make a crazy style Teenage Zombie Flick, this is how to do it and make it work . . . just don't call it ""Return of the Living Dead"". In a sad twist, this film sits in the same category as films before it like Halloween III. Had Halloween III released under a different title, the film might have done better. People looking for Michael Myers wouldn't have been so angry. As a spooky film on it's own, it's a fairly well done movie that is worth watching. The same can be said here. Return of the Living Dead Necropolis is not a horrible Zombie film on it's own, but as a sequel in the franchise, it is just bad. The people responsible for the film seem to have ignored every ""Rule"" for the Zombies set up in the first three films, trying to rewrite the mythology of the series and falling flat on their faces in doing so.Still, as a Zombie film on it's own, it isn't a horrible film and can still be enjoyed if this is your thing. I am into more hardcore Zombie films than this, but I can still appreciate it for what it is. Mistitled, but not horrible and worth a watch.

It seems like the filmmakers may have watched(and for the most part ignored)the first 3 movies.

Unlike Romero's films, the Return films have now gone down the path of utter disgrace.Everything in Necropolis destroys everything that parts 1-3 of the series grounded. The zombies can be killed with a shot to the head now, yet a severed limb can exist without a brain? Some zombies have no control over any bodily function, yet another zombie can talk, recall memories, and have the urge to fight a victim for pure spite and never act upon taking a bite out of him? And what the heck was with the ""oh, let's think we're funny and spoof the first one"" with the whole ""Send more security"" bit?If anything could have saved that mess, it should have been the characters. No, not at all. There may have been one character I cared about, but in the end, she didn't even matter. And the one character they tried to play as sweet and innocent and then turn her into a ""foul-mouthed tough chick"", that was a big joke. And one thing about the plot - in a way - is how can a guy see his thought-to-be-dead parents as now biological weapons be blowns to pieces and his little brother with his head ripped open and act like he doesn't give two cents about it, yet when the girl he supposedly likes is gunned down, he acts like it's the end of the world?No ma'ams and sirs.

You basically go into these knowing what to expect, but every now and then, you get one that manages to redefine what horror really is.

The story is about a scientist who finds a few Russians (I think) who have 3 of the zombie chemical canisters in their possession. He buys them wanting to create zombie soldiers for the future. The main star of the film is the scientists nefue, whom he lives with and does not know what his uncle does at the research facility. One of the kids friends ends up having a motorcycle accident and is taken away in an ambulance. When the son arrives at the hospital to see his friend, he is informed that his friend had an allergic reaction to the pain killers and was pronounced DOA. While he sits waiting in morning at the hospital, his friend rings him to say his so called dead friend was taken to the research facility she works at as a monitor guard, and they decide to get some friends together to rescue his friend from the facility. The only thing is, the facility is not just doing the kind of research the claim, and you can guess what is inside, and what ends up being released. All hell breaks loose and a zombie infestation riots the building.Now, I know a lot of people have been slamming this movie saying it broke all the rules. And yes, it does. I was not a fan of the fact that you can now shoot a zombie in the head, and it will die. In the first 2 or 3 movies, you couldn't kill them, shoot them anywhere, they still run around like a headless chicken... but I thought maybe, maybe the scientist did something to the chemical so that if it reanimated the corpses, or infected the living, the dosage is different and they can be stopped now, provided the brain is damaged? Of coarse, this is NOT the explanation at all, the makes of this film just didn't do their homework, but when I looked at it that way, the movie is not all that bad. It has blood and guts and a few decent moments.. yet again, there are some down right stupid moments too, but in defense of that, all 5 of these movies are guilty of that.I dunno, it may just be me, but I thought this wasn't that bad of a movie. Maybe if you look at it as a separate movie to the ROTLD films, you may enjoy it. There where some rules not followed, and that really did not sit well with fans, but overall, I have seen way worse zombie films, and I don't think this one deserves to be slammed as a 1 star cluster %$#@. It was entertaining enough from start to finish, and I think the only thing that needed to be changed was when a zombie is shot in the head and goes down, he/she gets back up eventually. But oh well, what can you do, it's not like someone will ever officially change it... I mean look at what a disaster that so called comedy version of that Zombie on the island of kids graduation rave party movie was.

The 1985 comedy/horror classic, it's lesser but even more comedy-laden sequel, and the third film which traded in the laughs for all out shocks and gore.  All three films were good in varying degrees, which is why the idea that a made for the Sci-Fi Channel sequel will surely leave you thinking that the results of this will be anything less than comprehensible.  Filmed in Romania, Peter Coyote is the only recognizable face as a mad scientist whose teenage nephew and his friends get mixed up with the local evil company; which leads to zombies running amok.  Make no mistake that Return of the Living Dead 4 is beyond bad with a few good moments (when two friends come across a former female friend turned zombie, the one yells at the other one to shoot her, as the other responds ""but I lost my virginity to her!"") but what else did you expect?

While it would have been preferable to have Dan O'Bannon back in the big chair, Elkayem (Eight-Legged Freaks) was a good second-string choice; the man already has a demonstrated ability to blend horror and humor. Which is why the straightforward dramatic nature of this flick is so surprising.Don't get me wrong, there's humor. (What would a TROTLD flick be without a ""send more security guards!"" line?) However, Elkayem and scriptwriters William Butler and Aaron Strongoni (who previously collaborated on last year's Madhouse)  had a lot they wanted to get accomplished here, and when something fell by the wayside due to time constraints, it ended up being the slapstick.Thus, what we end up with is a straight horror flick that rarely feels as if it has anything to do with the TROTLD franchise. It's amusing enough, in its way, but it really wouldn't stand on its own without the power of the franchise behind it.Much of this has to do with the acting. It's extremely hard to figure out what the usually underrated Peter Coyote (recently of the short-lived, but wonderful, The Inside) was thinking in this flick; he walks around with a look on his face that says someone in the room just passed very nasty gas, which would be understandable if the look didn't persist in scenes where he was alone. The rest of the cast, mostly comprised of the usual young-and-beautifuls one expects in a horror flick, do their jobs capably, but nothing more than that.While the movie does have an appealing ""turn your brain off and enjoy the fun"" quality to it, it's not well-done enough or seamless enough to really allow you to turn off your brain (in the way, say, C.H.U.D. 2 was).A much better flick than Return of the Living Dead 2, but not even close to the quality of the original. ** ",3,"Tries, but does not succeed.",1148342400,"05 23, 2006",2006,2056,"['Return', 'Living', 'Dead', '4', 'Necropolis', 'Ellory', 'Elkayem', '2005', 'been', 'twelve', 'years', 'anyone', 'poured', 'new', 'blood', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', 'franchise', 'one', 'best', 'overlook', 'woefully', 'ill-thought-out', 'second', 'film', 'horror/humor', 'blends', 'business', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'preferable', 'have', 'Dan', ""O'Bannon"", 'back', 'big', 'chair', 'Elkayem', 'Eight-Legged', 'Freaks', 'was', 'good', 'second-string', 'choice', 'man', 'already', 'demonstrated', 'ability', 'blend', 'horror', 'humor', 'Which', 'why', 'straightforward', 'dramatic', 'nature', 'flick', 'so', 'surprising.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'humor', 'What', 'would', 'TROTLD', 'flick', 'be', 'send', 'more', 'security', 'guards', 'line', 'However', 'Elkayem', 'scriptwriters', 'William', 'Butler', 'Aaron', 'Strongoni', 'who', 'previously', 'collaborated', 'last', 'year', 'Madhouse', 'had', 'lot', 'wanted', 'get', 'accomplished', 'here', 'when', 'something', 'fell', 'wayside', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'slapstick.Thus', 'what', 'end', 'up', 'straight', 'horror', 'flick', 'rarely', 'anything', 'do', 'TROTLD', 'franchise', 'amusing', 'enough', 'way', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'stand', 'own', 'power', 'franchise', 'it.Much', 'do', 'acting', 'extremely', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'usually', 'underrated', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'recently', 'short-lived', 'wonderful', 'Inside', 'was', 'thinking', 'flick', 'look', 'face', 'someone', 'room', 'just', 'passed', 'very', 'nasty', 'gas', 'would', 'be', 'understandable', 'look', 'did', ""n't"", 'persist', 'scenes', 'where', 'was', 'alone', 'rest', 'cast', 'mostly', 'comprised', 'usual', 'young-and-beautifuls', 'one', 'horror', 'flick', 'do', 'jobs', 'capably', 'nothing', 'more', 'movie', 'have', 'appealing', 'turn', 'brain', 'enjoy', 'fun', 'quality', 'not', 'well-done', 'enough', 'seamless', 'enough', 'really', 'allow', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'way', 'say', 'C.H.U.D', '2', 'was', '.A', 'much', 'better', 'flick', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', '2', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'quality', 'original', '**']",Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis

It is a film made for fun, and most audiences know that before watching it. Ironically, the fourth entry of the `ROTD' series, made after more than 10 years since the third one, is not much fun. It's not funny enough, campy enough, let alone scary enough. Well, I like the Russian mafia zombie growling `BRAAAAINNN!!!' but that does not amount to much.[THE FORMAT] is a familiar one. One big company, one secret experiment, lots of the un-deads eating human's brains. Motorcycle-riding high school students sneak into the company's facility in order to rescue their friend who is brought there after he is badly injured. Please don't ask me how they manage to break into the building riding the bikes, or manage to forge ID cards. This silly story must be believed for the director is Ellory Elkayem, whose previous film as jolly sci-fi film `Eight Legged Freaks,' in which giant spiders attacked humans.However, the film lacks the tongue-in-cheek attitudes seen in `Eight Legged Freaks,' the very thing that should have made this `Necropolis' more entertaining. The first half of it is just boring, edited clumsily, and very slow. The second half gets better with the teenagers' bloody fight against zombies and ""zombie soldier unit,"" but these zombie attack scenes are at best inferior copies of George A. Romero without humor or irony. It is like watching clones of Romero's `Land of the Dead' or Zack Snyder's `Dawn of the Dead,' and perhaps those superior films, made primarily to scare the audiences, have more funny scenes than `Necropolis' which just doesn't know why it was made in the first place.[SHOT IN ...] Talking about scary, `Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis' has one scary part. That is the opening set in Chernobyl, Ukraine, where the story begins. In the deserted nuclear power station, Peter Coyote's scientist purchases green, slimy toxic waste which turns humans into zombies.
