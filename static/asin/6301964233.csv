275869,A2GK7QG6O5OKZ4,6301964233,Alan clayton,"[2, 2]","When viewed on T.V. Garbo's first sound film has always seemed to me rather creaky, its pacing at times laboured, and the actress herself in many scenes awkward and ill at ease. On this American sourced disc almost all of these reservations disappear - Marie Dressler's performance in particular springs to life. Picture and sound are both very clear, and there are optional English subtitles if at times  accents (not only Garbo's) seem a barrier to clarity. Directed by Clarence Brown, the film at last seems to deserve its reputation, and is no longer obscured by technical shortcomings. For me, her performance remains a slight if lesser problem. But, the purchaser here also has Garbo's second talkie, again Anna Christie, directed by Jacques Feyder, made back to back for the German market, and utilising similar though not always identical  sets, but, Garbo apart, different actors, costumes, and camera set-ups. This hitherto hard to find film has long had the reputation of being superior to Brown's film, and was the reason for my purchase of this disc. Garbo certainly seems much more relaxed, and more clearly inhabits her role, aided in part by two very different male leads, to both of whom she seems to find it easier to react. The print quality here is not the equal of the first version, hence 4 stars instead of 5, but it is fully subtitled, and the film's direction, as well as most of the performances, I thought more convincing, and the film deserves its reputation. Each film gains from viewing the other, and the whole thing has been a most pleasant surprise.

275870,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,6301964233,Alex Udvary,"[4, 6]","""Garbo Talks"" - that was the tagline when this movie opened in 1930. It was Greta Garbo's first talking picture after most movie studios were starting to make the big switch to sound pictures. ""Anna Christie"", if only for that one reason only, was a major motion picture event, yet somehow I feel the movie is dated and doesn't quite take as many chances as other movies from the time period.Oh I know what many of you are thinking, hey what's wrong with you? How could a movie take too many chances when there was a production code in effect? My answer to you is the production code didn't come until 1933 this movie was made in 1930. Have you ever seen ""Grand Hotel""? ""Paid""? ""Possessed (1931)""? All of those movies took chances. They showed images that were truly ahead of their time. They tackled issues head on. ""Anna Christie"" I think could have been a great movie but it just doesn't risk enough.Garbo plays the title character a girl who hasn't seen her father, Chris (George F. Marion) in 15 years after he sent her to live with some relatives in St. Paul. Anna comes back to her father after being in the hospital and says she's sick. But her father doesn't exactly know what kind of life she has been leading while away. He think she was a nurse when in fact she was a prostitute.Chris, a sailor, decides that Anna might enjoy life on the sea. Out in the fresh air her health might improve. Things go along fine until a violent storm brings Matt into their life after they rescue him out at sea. Matt (Charles Bickford) falls for Anna and after a while tells her he wants to marry her. And soon Anna must decide whether or not she should tell Matt and her father about her past life.While reading this review the movie might sound pretty brave but wait until to you see it.The movie is based on a play by Eugene O' Neil and was directed by Clarence Brown who had worked with Garbo on several other pictures including ""Anna Karenina"", ""Romance"" and ""Devil in the Flesh"". Brown though was a really great director. I'm not sure how well known he is to today's audience but with such films as ""Wife vs Secretary"" (With Clark Gable and Jean Harlow) and ""Possessed"" (Also with Gable and Joan Crawford) he proved his status as an ""A"" list director.But ""Anna Christie"" is a different matter. The film's most powerful moments are in the climax. The rest of the movie just floats along. I wasn't involved in what was happening to these people. Garbo is fine though, she always had an amazing screen presence to her. Your eyes just tend to follow her, she had the true makings of a star. But you can't say that about everyone else in this. I found George F. Marion annoying. Was that accent real?In a surprise role Marie Dressler plays a woman who was living with Chris before Anna arrives. It is a surprise because for those who don't know Dressler was something of a comic. She appeared with Charlie Chaplin in his first film in 1914, yes she's that old. And is probably best known for co-starring with Jean Harlow in that sparkling 1930s all-star comedy ""Dinner at Eight"". At one time believe it or not she was a top box-office draw. But in this movie she tries to play it straight. Sure she has a few mild attempts at comedy, but she not as broad as she usually is. And I think she pulls the role off quite nicely. One almost wonders what would have happen she if played more of these kinds of roles.I hate to sound like I hate this movie. It is worth seeing. The final moments are strong, Garbo is good, the dialogue is so-so, and Brown pulls things together nicely. And despite whatever complaints I may have the movie was up for three Oscars, ""Best Director"" and Garbo was up for ""Best Actress"", her first nomination.Bottom-line: Moderately entertaining Clarence Brown\Greta Garbo film take just doesn't take enough chances. Could have been a powerhouse of a movie instead is just average.",3,"""Garbo Talks!""",1118188800,"06 8, 2005",2005,3896,"['Garbo', 'Talks', 'was', 'tagline', 'when', 'movie', 'opened', '1930', 'was', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'first', 'talking', 'picture', 'most', 'movie', 'studios', 'were', 'starting', 'make', 'big', 'switch', 'sound', 'pictures', 'Anna', 'Christie', 'only', 'one', 'reason', 'only', 'was', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'event', 'somehow', 'feel', 'movie', 'dated', ""n't"", 'quite', 'take', 'many', 'chances', 'other', 'movies', 'time', 'period.Oh', 'know', 'what', 'many', 'are', 'thinking', 'hey', 'what', 'wrong', 'How', 'could', 'movie', 'take', 'too', 'many', 'chances', 'when', 'was', 'production', 'code', 'effect', 'answer', 'production', 'code', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', '1933', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1930', 'Have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'Paid', 'Possessed', '1931', 'movies', 'took', 'chances', 'showed', 'images', 'were', 'truly', 'ahead', 'time', 'tackled', 'issues', 'head', 'Anna', 'Christie', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'risk', 'enough.Garbo', 'title', 'character', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'father', 'Chris', 'George', 'F.', 'Marion', '15', 'years', 'sent', 'live', 'relatives', 'St.', 'Paul', 'Anna', 'back', 'father', 'being', 'hospital', 'sick', 'father', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'life', 'been', 'leading', 'away', 'think', 'was', 'nurse', 'when', 'fact', 'was', 'prostitute.Chris', 'sailor', 'Anna', 'might', 'enjoy', 'life', 'sea', 'fresh', 'air', 'health', 'might', 'improve', 'Things', 'go', 'along', 'fine', 'violent', 'storm', 'Matt', 'life', 'rescue', 'out', 'sea', 'Matt', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'Anna', 'while', 'marry', 'soon', 'Anna', 'must', 'decide', 'not', 'should', 'tell', 'Matt', 'father', 'past', 'life.While', 'reading', 'movie', 'might', 'sound', 'pretty', 'brave', 'wait', 'see', 'it.The', 'movie', 'based', 'play', 'Eugene', 'O', 'Neil', 'was', 'directed', 'Clarence', 'Brown', 'who', 'had', 'worked', 'Garbo', 'several', 'other', 'pictures', 'including', 'Anna', 'Karenina', 'Romance', 'Devil', 'Flesh', 'Brown', 'was', 'really', 'great', 'director', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'well', 'known', 'today', 'audience', 'such', 'films', 'Wife', 'vs', 'Secretary', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'Possessed', 'Also', 'Gable', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'proved', 'status', 'A', 'list', 'director.But', 'Anna', 'Christie', 'different', 'matter', 'film', 'most', 'powerful', 'moments', 'are', 'climax', 'rest', 'movie', 'just', 'floats', 'along', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'people', 'Garbo', 'fine', 'always', 'had', 'amazing', 'screen', 'presence', 'eyes', 'just', 'tend', 'follow', 'had', 'true', 'makings', 'star', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'everyone', 'else', 'found', 'George', 'F.', 'Marion', 'annoying', 'Was', 'accent', 'real', 'surprise', 'role', 'Marie', 'Dressler', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'living', 'Chris', 'Anna', 'surprise', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Dressler', 'was', 'something', 'comic', 'appeared', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'first', 'film', '1914', 'yes', 'old', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'co-starring', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'sparkling', '1930s', 'all-star', 'comedy', 'Dinner', 'Eight', 'one', 'time', 'believe', 'not', 'was', 'top', 'box-office', 'draw', 'movie', 'play', 'straight', 'Sure', 'few', 'mild', 'attempts', 'comedy', 'not', 'as', 'broad', 'usually', 'think', 'role', 'quite', 'nicely', 'One', 'almost', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happen', 'played', 'more', 'kinds', 'roles.I', 'hate', 'sound', 'hate', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'final', 'moments', 'are', 'strong', 'Garbo', 'good', 'dialogue', 'so-so', 'Brown', 'pulls', 'things', 'together', 'nicely', 'complaints', 'may', 'have', 'movie', 'was', 'up', 'three', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Director', 'Garbo', 'was', 'up', 'Best', 'Actress', 'first', 'nomination.Bottom-line', 'Moderately', 'entertaining', 'Clarence', 'Brown\\Greta', 'Garbo', 'film', 'take', 'just', ""n't"", 'take', 'enough', 'chances', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'powerhouse', 'movie', 'instead', 'just', 'average']",Anna Christie VHS
275871,A9TARC4EV6EXK,6301964233,"antistat ""kensboy""","[2, 4]","This remarkably moving film was Greta's talkie debut.  It holds up not only as her finest screen performance but as the best film production of a Eugene O'Neill play.  The supporting cast is superb, the magnificent Marie Dressler, in particular, delivering a performance for the ages.  Director Clarence Brown succeeds in creating a mood of melancholy and muted hope that, along with the fine writing and brilliant acting, makes it one of the classics of American Film making.  And yet, through the years, the reputation of this movie has faded because of an odd assembly of inaccurate impressions.  Four trends in particular have combined to unfairly diminish the appreciation of this wonderful film.  1. The decline of Eugene O'Neill's reputation.  Anna Christie won the Pulizer Prize in 1922.  O'Neill was considered to be to playwriting what Hemingway and Faulkner would later become to novels, the American who could stand comparison with Europe's finest.  His fall from that position has been precipitous.  Today it's common place to hear people comment on how dated his plays are and, more devastatingly, how boring.  I'm not going to argue the point on O'Neill generally, but as far as Anna Christie itself goes, I find it involving, meaningful and universal.  So if you haven't seen the movie before, leave any O'Neill preconception behind and you'll find that Brown, O'Neill and Garbo can slice your soul in this powerful production.  2. Greta didn't like the movie.  According to Mark A. Vieira in his brilliant Greta Garbo: A Cinematic Legacy, her quote to a fellow Swede after she saw the movie was, ""Isn't it terrible?!  Who ever saw Swedes act like that""  Her concern that it was an unflattering portrait of her countrymen troubled her throughout the production.  However, it wasn't the responsibility of O'Neill, Brown or Garbo herself to present an idealized picture of Swedes but to tell the truth.  And in answer to Greta's question, ""Who ever saw Swedes act like that?"" let me answer.  I have.  I'm quite sure Greta's unenthusiastic reaction to the movie has hurt it more and more as her status as infallible icon has grown.  3. Greta liked the German version better.  In all due respect, I find that observation absurd.  It may be more accessible to German and Scandinavian audiences but it is not better than the English version.  English speaking viewers who express this view I feel are being insincere or arty or are simply parroting something Greta said. 4. The bigger than life image of Garbo.  In the eight decades since this movie premiered, Greta Garbo has become an international icon of indisputable significance.  Her adoring fans look back towards her as an unrivaled symbol of film magic.  And so they tend to like the movies where she is bigger than life, magical, iconic.  Grand Hotel, Anna Karinina, Camille and the ridiculously overrated Queen Christina have become the movies that they love.  They're much more comfortable with Greta playing a ballerina, a member of Russian aristocracy, a Queen or a consort of princes than a down and out, lowlife prostitute.  I hear people describing her performance in Anna Christie as ""depressing"" and ""dreary.""  And yet, in that remarkable first scene in the bar, she most successfully creates a real human being, one we can recognize, understand, love and weep for.",5,"A Great, Underrated Film",1270252800,"04 3, 2010",2010,3345,"['remarkably', 'moving', 'film', 'was', 'Greta', 'talkie', 'debut', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'finest', 'screen', 'performance', 'best', 'film', 'production', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'play', 'supporting', 'cast', 'superb', 'magnificent', 'Marie', 'Dressler', 'particular', 'delivering', 'performance', 'ages', 'Director', 'Clarence', 'Brown', 'creating', 'mood', 'melancholy', 'muted', 'hope', 'fine', 'writing', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'one', 'classics', 'American', 'Film', 'making', 'yet', 'years', 'reputation', 'movie', 'faded', 'odd', 'assembly', 'inaccurate', 'impressions', 'Four', 'trends', 'particular', 'have', 'combined', 'unfairly', 'diminish', 'appreciation', 'wonderful', 'film', '1', 'decline', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'reputation', 'Anna', 'Christie', 'won', 'Pulizer', 'Prize', '1922', ""O'Neill"", 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'playwriting', 'what', 'Hemingway', 'Faulkner', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'novels', 'American', 'who', 'could', 'stand', 'comparison', 'Europe', 'finest', 'fall', 'position', 'been', 'precipitous', 'Today', 'common', 'place', 'hear', 'people', 'comment', 'how', 'dated', 'plays', 'are', 'more', 'devastatingly', 'how', 'boring', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'argue', 'point', ""O'Neill"", 'generally', 'as', 'far', 'Anna', 'Christie', 'find', 'involving', 'meaningful', 'universal', 'So', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'leave', ""O'Neill"", 'preconception', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Brown', ""O'Neill"", 'Garbo', 'can', 'slice', 'soul', 'powerful', 'production', '2', 'Greta', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'According', 'Mark', 'A.', 'Vieira', 'brilliant', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'Cinematic', 'Legacy', 'quote', 'fellow', 'Swede', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'Who', 'ever', 'saw', 'Swedes', 'act', 'concern', 'was', 'unflattering', 'portrait', 'countrymen', 'troubled', 'production', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'responsibility', ""O'Neill"", 'Brown', 'Garbo', 'present', 'idealized', 'picture', 'Swedes', 'tell', 'truth', 'answer', 'Greta', 'question', 'Who', 'ever', 'saw', 'Swedes', 'act', 'let', 'answer', 'have', ""'m"", 'quite', 'sure', 'Greta', 'unenthusiastic', 'reaction', 'movie', 'hurt', 'more', 'more', 'status', 'infallible', 'icon', 'grown', '3', 'Greta', 'liked', 'German', 'version', 'better', 'due', 'respect', 'find', 'observation', 'absurd', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'accessible', 'German', 'Scandinavian', 'audiences', 'not', 'better', 'English', 'version', 'English', 'speaking', 'viewers', 'who', 'express', 'view', 'feel', 'are', 'being', 'insincere', 'arty', 'are', 'simply', 'parroting', 'something', 'Greta', 'said', '4', 'bigger', 'life', 'image', 'Garbo', 'eight', 'decades', 'movie', 'premiered', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'become', 'international', 'icon', 'indisputable', 'significance', 'adoring', 'fans', 'look', 'back', 'towards', 'unrivaled', 'symbol', 'film', 'magic', 'so', 'tend', 'like', 'movies', 'where', 'bigger', 'life', 'magical', 'iconic', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'Anna', 'Karinina', 'Camille', 'ridiculously', 'overrated', 'Queen', 'Christina', 'have', 'become', 'movies', 'love', ""'re"", 'much', 'more', 'comfortable', 'Greta', 'playing', 'ballerina', 'member', 'Russian', 'aristocracy', 'Queen', 'consort', 'princes', 'down', 'out', 'lowlife', 'prostitute', 'hear', 'people', 'describing', 'performance', 'Anna', 'Christie', 'depressing', 'dreary', 'yet', 'remarkable', 'first', 'scene', 'bar', 'most', 'successfully', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'one', 'can', 'recognize', 'understand', 'love', 'weep']",Anna Christie VHS

The marketing of the film ensured that this was a major cinematic event and the film was a box office smash but it does not really stand the test of time.Based on a depressing Eugene O'Neill play, this is an unusual piece for Garbo because she plays a contemporary figure surrounded by 3 character actors in demanding parts. She suffers by comparison. George Marion as her father and Marie Dressler as his mistress create incredibly real people. The scenes with Dressler are wonderful; Garbo, the mistress of underacting, with Dressler, the mistress of overacting, and meeting in the middle with genuine rapport. Charles Bickford as the boorish Irish lover is good too but he has no charisma, no screen magnetism. It is just not convincing that Garbo could fall for him. The film has endless talk, little action, a static camera and a soundtrack which is often hard to understand. Garbo's unease with American slang is obvious with some of her line readings emphasising the wrong words. The story has a poor ending, moving from hysteria to rationalisation in the flick of an eye and with what has gone on before, it is easy to speculate that this motley group have got lots of bad times ahead.The print of the film is surprisingly good and far superior to other Garbo DVDs of later talkies.

275876,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6301964233,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 5]","""Anna Christie"" is a 1930 film of a 1922 Pulitzer prize winning Eugene O'Neill play.  This was the second filming of the play, an early silent film having been directed by Thomas Ince in 1923. It stars Greta Garbo with George Marion, Charles Bickford, and Marie Dressler.This film was Garbo's first talkie. Prior to this Garbo had been in nearly 20 silent films, starting as early as 1920. Her best known silent films were ""Flesh and the Devil"" (1926) which was directed by Clarence Brown, and ""Love"" (1927) in which she co-starred with John Gilbert. She was nominated 3 times for an Oscar (""Anna Christie"", ""Camille"", and ""Ninotchka"") but never won. She is listed #5 on the AFI's list of Greatest Actresses. Her salary for"" Anna Christie"" was $250,000.George Marion appeared in the original play and in the silent film of the same name (1923). He reprises his role in the 1930 film. Marion appeared in 35 films, mostly in the silent era. In 1930 alone he appeared in 8 films, including Oscar winning ""The Big House"". Marion plays Garbo's father.Crusty Charles Bickford appeared in nearly 100 films. ""Anna Christie"" was his fourth film. He was nominated for an Oscar three times (""Song of Bernadette"" in 1943, ""The Farmer's Daughter"" in 1947, and ""Johnny Belinda"" in 1949), and each time, the actress who played opposite him won the Oscar for Best Actress - Jennifer Jones, Loretta Young, and Jane Wyman. Bickford plays a sailor who falls in love with Grabo, unaware she was a prostitute.Marie Dressler was a major star of the silent era. She started in films in 1910 at the age of 42 and was famous for her Tillie films (1914, 1915, 1917) and later won the Oscar for her role as Min in ""Min and Bill"" (1930) opposite Wallace Beery, and was nominated in 1932 for ""Emma"". Her final film performance was as ""Tugboat Annie"" (1933) opposite Beery again. Dressler plays the girlfriend of Garbo's father.Clarence Brown directs. Brown was a well known silent film director (""Last of the Mohicans"", ""Flesh and the Devil""). He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times (""Anna Christie"", ""A Free Soul"", ""The Human Comedy"", ""National Velvet"", and ""The Yearling"") but never won. His films earned 38 Oscar nominations and 9 wins, but never for Director. This was his second film with Garbo and they would work together on 4 more films. He loved working with actresses, and also worked with Joan Crawford 6 times.Williams Daniels is the cinematographer. Garbo insisted he shoot all her films, which he did, except for 2 (""Conquest"", ""Two-faced Woman"") which turned out to be flops at the box office. When not working with Garbo, Daniels was a favorite of Erich von Stroheim, who was Garbo's favorite director (even though she made 6 films with Brown). Daniels lensed more than 150 films. He was nominated 3 times (""Anna Christie"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""How the West was Won"") and won once (""Naked City"" in 1948).Irving Thalberg produced. Known as ""The Boy Wonder"", Thalberg transformed MGM into the powerhouse it became. He sponsored the Marx Brothers as well as films such as ""The Big Parade"" (1925), ""Grand Hotel"" (1932), ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935), ""San Francisco"" (1936), and ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1936).Although the staging for Garbo's entrance is great, with the audience waiting  to see her saunter up to the bar and say ""Gif me a viskey, and don't be stingy baby"", by today's standards it's a little too long to wait for the headliner to appear. Nonetheless, the public and critics were excited. The New York Tribune called her voice ""deep, husky contralto that possesses every bit of that fabulous poetic glamour..."" BTW - her husky voice was part of her act. In real life her voice was quite high, but she practiced for years to develop a deep voice so that she could make the transition to sound films.The film received 3 Oscar nominations (Actress, Director, Cinematography) but didn't win. As was common in 1930 films, the camera is relatively static and rather than film oriented, this is more of a filmed play. As well, many of the actors came from the silent film era, so the acting tends to be exaggerated. Although there are some early 30s films that resemble more modern film techniques (e.g., ""Public Enemy"", ""Grand Hotel""), this is not one of them.The film has historic value as the first Garbo talkie, and there is another great performance from Marie Dressler. It's also great to see photos of the New York skyline in 1930. But otherwise the film fails to hold up by more modern standards.",2,"Garbo talks, I nap",1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,4496,"['Anna', 'Christie', '1930', 'film', '1922', 'Pulitzer', 'prize', 'winning', 'Eugene', ""O'Neill"", 'play', 'was', 'second', 'filming', 'play', 'early', 'silent', 'film', 'having', 'been', 'directed', 'Thomas', 'Ince', '1923', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'George', 'Marion', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'Marie', 'Dressler.This', 'film', 'was', 'Garbo', 'first', 'talkie', 'Prior', 'Garbo', 'had', 'been', 'nearly', '20', 'silent', 'films', 'starting', 'as', 'early', '1920', 'best', 'known', 'silent', 'films', 'were', 'Flesh', 'Devil', '1926', 'was', 'directed', 'Clarence', 'Brown', 'Love', '1927', 'co-starred', 'John', 'Gilbert', 'was', 'nominated', '3', 'times', 'Oscar', 'Anna', 'Christie', 'Camille', 'Ninotchka', 'never', 'won', 'listed', '5', 'AFI', 'list', 'Greatest', 'Actresses', 'salary', 'Anna', 'Christie', 'was', '250,000.George', 'Marion', 'appeared', 'original', 'play', 'silent', 'film', 'same', 'name', '1923', 'role', '1930', 'film', 'Marion', 'appeared', '35', 'films', 'mostly', 'silent', 'era', '1930', 'alone', 'appeared', '8', 'films', 'including', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Big', 'House', 'Marion', 'Garbo', 'father.Crusty', 'Charles', 'Bickford', 'appeared', 'nearly', '100', 'films', 'Anna', 'Christie', 'was', 'fourth', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'three', 'times', 'Song', 'Bernadette', '1943', 'Farmer', 'Daughter', '1947', 'Johnny', 'Belinda', '1949', 'time', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'opposite', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'Jane', 'Wyman', 'Bickford', 'sailor', 'who', 'love', 'Grabo', 'unaware', 'was', 'prostitute.Marie', 'Dressler', 'was', 'major', 'star', 'silent', 'era', 'started', 'films', '1910', 'age', '42', 'was', 'famous', 'Tillie', 'films', '1914', '1915', '1917', 'later', 'won', 'Oscar', 'role', 'Min', 'Min', 'Bill', '1930', 'opposite', 'Wallace', 'Beery', 'was', 'nominated', '1932', 'Emma', 'final', 'film', 'performance', 'was', 'Tugboat', 'Annie', '1933', 'opposite', 'Beery', 'again', 'Dressler', 'girlfriend', 'Garbo', 'father.Clarence', 'Brown', 'directs', 'Brown', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'silent', 'film', 'director', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'Flesh', 'Devil', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', '5', 'times', 'Anna', 'Christie', 'Free', 'Soul', 'Human', 'Comedy', 'National', 'Velvet', 'Yearling', 'never', 'won', 'films', 'earned', '38', 'Oscar', 'nominations', '9', 'wins', 'never', 'Director', 'was', 'second', 'film', 'Garbo', 'would', 'work', 'together', '4', 'more', 'films', 'loved', 'working', 'actresses', 'also', 'worked', 'Joan', 'Crawford', '6', 'times.Williams', 'Daniels', 'cinematographer', 'Garbo', 'insisted', 'films', 'did', '2', 'Conquest', 'Two-faced', 'Woman', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'flops', 'box', 'office', 'When', 'not', 'working', 'Garbo', 'Daniels', 'was', 'favorite', 'Erich', 'von', 'Stroheim', 'who', 'was', 'Garbo', 'favorite', 'director', 'even', 'made', '6', 'films', 'Brown', 'Daniels', 'lensed', 'more', '150', 'films', 'was', 'nominated', '3', 'times', 'Anna', 'Christie', 'Cat', 'Hot', 'Tin', 'Roof', 'How', 'West', 'was', 'Won', 'won', 'once', 'Naked', 'City', '1948', '.Irving', 'Thalberg', 'produced', 'Known', 'Boy', 'Wonder', 'Thalberg', 'transformed', 'MGM', 'powerhouse', 'became', 'sponsored', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'as', 'well', 'films', 'such', 'Big', 'Parade', '1925', 'Grand', 'Hotel', '1932', 'Mutiny', 'Bounty', '1935', 'San', 'Francisco', '1936', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', '1936', 'staging', 'Garbo', 'entrance', 'great', 'audience', 'waiting', 'see', 'saunter', 'up', 'bar', 'say', 'Gif', 'viskey', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'stingy', 'baby', 'today', 'standards', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'wait', 'headliner', 'appear', 'Nonetheless', 'public', 'critics', 'were', 'excited', 'New', 'York', 'Tribune', 'called', 'voice', 'deep', 'husky', 'contralto', 'bit', 'fabulous', 'poetic', 'glamour', 'BTW', 'husky', 'voice', 'was', 'part', 'act', 'real', 'life', 'voice', 'was', 'quite', 'high', 'practiced', 'years', 'develop', 'deep', 'voice', 'so', 'could', 'make', 'transition', 'sound', 'films.The', 'film', 'received', '3', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Actress', 'Director', 'Cinematography', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'was', 'common', '1930', 'films', 'camera', 'relatively', 'static', 'rather', 'film', 'oriented', 'more', 'filmed', 'play', 'well', 'many', 'actors', 'came', 'silent', 'film', 'era', 'acting', 'tends', 'be', 'exaggerated', 'are', 'early', '30s', 'films', 'resemble', 'more', 'modern', 'film', 'techniques', 'e.g.', 'Public', 'Enemy', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'not', 'one', 'them.The', 'film', 'historic', 'value', 'first', 'Garbo', 'talkie', 'great', 'performance', 'Marie', 'Dressler', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'photos', 'New', 'York', 'skyline', '1930', 'otherwise', 'film', 'hold', 'up', 'more', 'modern', 'standards']",Anna Christie VHS
275877,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6301964233,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","Although it is overshadowed by the artistry of Eugene O'Neil's later works, ANNA CHRISTIE has remained a favorite on the world scene since its 1921 stage debut.  It has received no fewer than three major Broadway revivals and has been filmed in various languages no less than eight times, and when regional, university, and community theatres do an O'Neil drama they often select this one over O'Neil's considerably more ambitious--and difficult--works.The film version that is best recalled is the 1930 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production starring Greta Garbo.  MGM feared that audiences would reject Garbo for her Swedish accent, and ANNA CHRISTIE was very specifically selected for her talkie debut because the character was Swedish and would naturally have a Swedish accent.  Ironically, by the time the film was made Garbo was so fluent in English that her Swedish accent was a little too soft for the part, and she actually had to ramp it up to be convincing in the role.  Publicized with the tag line ""GARBO TALKS!"" the film was a great success, and Garbo would continue as a great star for another decade.The play was and is a gritty melodrama, and although MGM romanticized the characters and added more than a little gloss, the story remained very close to the original stage success.  Anna (Garbo) has been raised by her mother's family on a farm while her father Chris (George F. Marion, reprising his Broadway performance) worked as a sailor.  He has grown old on the New York waterfront, the captian of a coal barge who lives with a decayed but genial prostitute named Marthy (Marie Dressler.)  When he receives word that his now-adult daughter is on her way to New York, he asks Marthy to leave, lest she prove a bad influence on the girl.  When Marthy meets Anna she recognizes that Anna is a prostitute, but she says nothing, and Anna goes to live with her father on the coal barge, where exposure to wind and water gradually make her feel clean.  She eventually meets and falls in love with a sailor, Matt (Charles Bickford)--but she realizes that she cannot live the lie and in burst of anger and guilt tells both her father and Matt about her past.  It was pretty hot stuff at the time, and within a few years censorship would make it impossible to re-release the film.The MGM production was actually filmed in three different versions.  The best known is the English-language talkie, but many theatres were still without sound technology in 1930, and this version was also released in a silent version--a fact which may account for Garbo's excessive use of silent-movie mannerisms throughout the film.  At the same time, however, MGM released a German-language version in Europe, again starring Garbo but with a different supporting cast; the studio never considered a silent cut of this version; Garbo's performance is more subtle and the film has a harsher, less romanticized tone.  Garbo is said to have preferred the German-language version of the film, and in some ways it is indeed superior to the English version.The German version was not a shot-for-shot copy of the English version, but both films shared a common trait.  There is a notion that the camera was fixed in place for early talking films, and that this resulted in movies with an extremely static quality.  That is not really true, but it is true that sound was still a difficult technology in 1930, and very few directors cared to further complicate their shooting schedules with difficult camera work.  ANNA CHRISTIE is indicative of this fact, and although the camera angle changes frequently, these changes are done as straight cuts.  The camera itself does not move; there are no tracking shots, no dolly shots, no overhead boom shots, no zoom shots of any kind.  This absence of what you might call camera vocabulary does become a little wearing toward the end of the film--be it English or German.The DVD release offers the English version on one side of the DVD and the German version on the other.  Neither have been significantly restored, but both are in good condition and fans will find the comparison fascinating.  The German version does not include the opening scene between Chris and Marthy, and it uses several shots from the English version, with the German actors dubbing in the voices and the film darkened in order to prevent German audiences from noticing the change in actors.  Although both versions have a certain visual clunkiness, the simple power of O'Neil's story remains, and Garbo faces the dreaded microphone with considerable aplomb, while Marie Dressler walks off with her every scene in the English version.  Recommended--but it will probably be best enjoyed by fans of the playwright, the actors, or early ""pre-code"" talkies.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,English and German Versions of the Garbo

275878,A2PR6NXG0PA3KY,6301964233,Giordano Bruno,"[1, 2]","... in staging Eugene O'Neil's 1920 drama ""Anna Christie"" is that it's a corny, dated melodrama. On the other hand, it's one of the best corny, dated melodramas in the repertoire. The language is undercooked. The central character Anna -- not Magdalena but close, a ruined woman of virtue -- is no longer plausible to psychologically sophisticated audiences. The drunken Swede, her father, with his vaudeville accent, and the roister-boister Irish sailor, her lover, with his brogue, are by now such overdrawn stereotypes that a modern viewer/reader will need to chuckle indulgently at the naivete of the American theater just ninety years ago. And then -- shades of Hell for a director in 2011! -- the play has a happy ending!Any temptation to update the drama and pop the corn has to be resisted. ""Anna Christie"" is a period piece -- far more so than a Shakespeare comedy -- utterly time- and culture-bound. It's a porthole through which to view the mentality of America in its pre-modern rusticity. It needs to be corny because America in 1920 was all corn. It wants to be a melodrama because only melodrama seemed real to Americans then ... and I'm not sure much has changed in the worldview of Americans since. In short, dear director/producer, don't fight it! Play it as it is.Perhaps that's why the 1930 adaptation of ""Anna Christie"" as a film was so paradigmatically perfect. It starred two veteran vaudeville exaggerators, George Marion as the sodden sailor father and Marie Dressler as his tramp trollop, along with Greta Garbo in her 'talkie' debut. Not only did Garbo come naturally to her Swedish accent but her human instincts were pure melodrama. The 'Magdalena' role of Anna Christie suited her perfectly because, I think, she ""believed"" in the archetype. Film-making in 1930, like the stage in 1920, was less than a generation past vaudeville, just emerging from the bombast and bathos of 19th Century theatrics. The script, the dramaturgy, the cinematography, and the acting styles are 'all of a piece.' Once again, dear viewer, don't fight it! Take it as it is!This is one of the great films of its era. One of the few, aside from the comedies of Chaplin and Keaton, that stand the test of time artistically. Thus I'm surprised to note how many 'luke warm' four-star reviews ""Anna Christie"" has attracted.

She swifts perfectly between radiant expressions of hope and innocence, and the sad knowledge of being 'doomed' by her past.The shortest possible synopsis would be this: Anna Christie admits to her father and fiance-to-be that she 'was in the house'. 'Yes, in that kind of house'. And when they hear this, they all want her to 'beat it'. I wouldn't spoil much by revealing that there actually is a happy ending. It involves a very funny moment, when Anna is making an oath upon the catholic cross, and suddenly admits that she isn't catholic.

Based on the gloomy play of the same name by Eugene O'Neill, this film has not aged all that well. Being an early talkie, it still reeks of some of the archness of expressions found in the silent films.Moreover, while Greta Garbo is herself understated in her unique acting style, some of her co-stars were less restrained. Marie Dressler is over the top hammy as an aging, boozy river tramp. George F. Marion as Old Chris, Anna Christie's father, is a caricature of an old Swedish seaman.  Charles Bickford, on the other hand, does a fine job as the Irish sailor who falls in love with Anna. Even his Irish brogue is believable, and his performance is the one that seems most comfortable in an early talky and withstands the test of time.The story is a simple one. Anna Christie has had a hard scrabble life, and at the ripe old age of 20, having lived as a prostitute, she seeks out her father, whom she has not seen since she was five. While on board her father's barge, she meets an Irish sailor and they fall in love, he believing her to be a good and virtuous woman.  When the truth comes out, the you know what hits the fan.This dark, moody film is worth seeing if one is a fan of Greta Garbo's or has a penchant for early talkies.

The film stars Greta Garbo in her first speaking role on film; and we get great performances from Charles Bickford, George F. Marion and Marie Dressler. The plot moves along at a good pace and I never felt bored; indeed, it was tough for me to take my eyes off Garbo! She gives a stunning performance. The choreography worked well although the cinematography was somewhat limited by the technology of the day.When the action starts, we meet Chris Christofferson (George F. Marion) and his friend Marthy Owens (Marie Dressler) who pal around and get drunk quite a lot at the local bar near the harbor where Chris works on a barge. It's been fifteen years since Chris sent his daughter Anna to the Midwest so that she ""could be safe inland;"" and they have had very limited contact since that time. Chris hasn't exactly tried to live up to being a good father; he never once in fifteen years traveled west to see his daughter.One day Chris and Marthy are at the local bar when Chris gets a letter from Anna that says she's coming home. He and Marthy wonder what she'll be like; and it isn't long before Anna (Garbo) makes her grand entrance when the bartender opens the ladies door entrance to the pub. Anna and Marthy strike up conversation and when Anna's father Chris soon comes he is happy to see Anna. He wants Anna to try to live with him on his barge although Anna has her doubts. In addition, Anna says she's been ill but she doesn't reveal too many details of her illness.For a while Anna and her father Chris travel on the barge; and after a very bad storm they rescue some sailors--including Matt Burke (Charles Bickford). Matt almost instantly falls in love with Anna; and she feels the same way about him. However, even after a some time and an especially magical day at New York's Coney Island amusement park, Anna is reluctant to marry Matt--and this causes a great deal of tension. The tension mounts even higher when Anna's father Chris wants her to remain with him.One powerful scene comes when Anna's father has her by one arm and Matt Burke has her by the other arm; they are both trying to pull Anna in their direction as if she were property! This leads Anna to reveal to them the truth about what she's really been doing for the last few years to make ends meet as well as what she ""truly"" had to do to earn her keep at her relative's home in the Midwest.What will Anna's father Chris and Matt Burke say when they realize what Anna has been doing? Will they still love Anna or will they both want to be rid of her? What about Marthy--how does she figure into all of this? Will Anna marry Matt after some type of reconciliation? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!Anna Christie remains one of the best early talkie films; and it's one of the most well known films Greta Garbo ever made.

I had remembered seeing that one of her movies was based on a Eugene O'Neill play and realized that this had to be the one.  This is a story of a small collection of life's misfits who try to take a chance at moving up the ladder only to discover they are where they belong.  It's a depressing idea and the movie conveys thet depression.  Garbo is good but, if anything, she's deminished by the quality of the rest of the cast.  I was most impressed with George F. Marion who played her father.  I never heard of this guy but he was outstanding in his role.  Charles Bickford continues to show me that he was a sort of Marlon Brando of his day.  Finally, Marie Dressler is quite impressive as the father's live-in girlfriend who moves out when he hears his daughter is coming for a visit.

Bette Davis, who was a devout &quot;Garbomaniac&quot; (as Garbo fans were called in the thirties), once stated about Garbo's acting: &quot;What Garbo did on the screen was sheer witchcraft... I cannot analyze this woman's acting&quot;. In her first sound film, after what seems an eternity, Garbo finally comes into view, weary and cynical, she says to the bartender: &quot;Gif me a viskey - chinger ale on the side. And don't be stingy, baby!&quot;. Her voice was blissfully right on target! This 1930 antique is very talky and reminds one of a silent movie with dialogue. If it were not so well-acted, it would be very tiresome indeed. Garbo's voice was noted as being in strange and beautiful accord with the Garbo personality of the silent pictures. Garbo had, more than than any other actress on the screen in the early thirties, the ability to emit the power of suggestion, and, in infinite degrees, expose the isolated mysteriousness of the human soul. Charles Bickford does quite well as the Irish seaman, and as the the old waterfront hag, Marthy Owens, Marie Dressler put an infinite amount of detail in her excellent (albeit a bit hammy) characterization; Garbo was so impressed by Dressler's performance that she personally brought a bouquet of chrysanthemums to Dressler's home in appreciation.
