1606299,A518CRYX4QKAH,B00A7F0LDY,Bookworm936,"[0, 1]","The movie is boring.  The plot isn't original.  It's about a girl who has a crush on a soccer player who doesn't return her feelings then bad things start to happen to his friends.  What made the movie a snoozer for us is there isn't any suspense.  The tormenting of the friends is very mild compared to other movies in the genre.  His friends open their curtains to find writing on their window stating ""He's Mine"".  Ohh then his girlfriend's nude pic gets sent to everyone in school.  And the most frightening is when his iPhone gets dropped in the swimming pool.The twist ending where the stalker isn't who you think she/he is didn't do much to redeem the movie.  I would recommend a rental as opposed to purchasing it outright.  If you want a ""fatal attraction""/crush gone wrong movie I would recommend Fatal Attraction or Crush (staring Alicia Silverstone).  Fatal Attraction and Crush (with Alicia Silverstone) are older movies but they are well done and suspensefull.

Crush is one of those films that I can easily imagine a bunch of teenage girls watching while at a slumber party.Lucas Till is dreamy. Crystal Reed is angsty. There's a few false scares throughout, but nothing too terribly suspenseful. The dialogue, the interactions between the characters and the overall characterizations have been simplified for its target audience. Ohhhh .....and there's a twist.Surprisingly though, Crush is well made and well acted. A lot better made and acted then the genre requires of it. However, it's too mild mannered in its approach. It's unimaginative and an unnecessary addition to the genre. It's teen audience will, at the least, find Crush watchable, but that's because they really don't know any better.

One of my all time favorite movies is Fatal Attraction WHICH IS WAY BETTER THAN THIS FILM!! This film copied greatly from that Kathy Bates movie Misery.  The problem more than anything else is that the film was boring.  If it were exciting it wouldn't even matter how silly it was concocted.  The girl you think at first will be the psycho but isn't reminded me of Jodi Arias, she was really good in her role but just couldn't save this film from going down.  Admittedly it was so dull and I watched it after been up too many hours so I kind of went in ""half sleep orbit"" after the ""big twist I read about in other reviews"" which was still dull but would never be inspired to watch this disaster again.  If you want to watch a really great thriller of this genre I suggest BASIC INSTINCT OR FATAL ATTRACTION.  I purchased this off other reviews that spoke to how great this was so I went in with an wide open mind but perhaps too high of expectations.

Now, he has to balance rehabilitation with friends, schoolwork, and a mysterious new crush, whose obsession with him threatens to destroy everything! From the very beginning, CRUSH plays into the same tired old cliches that frequent the thriller genre, first by introducing us to a group of well-groomed but utterly predictable teen stereotypes who make few attempts to gain our support. Lucas Till takes on the role of the pretty boy athlete against Crystal Reed's oddball loner, whose strange behavior leaves no room for ambiguity in the first and second acts. Right when it seems that everything has been figured out, however, writer Sonny Mallhi and director Malik Bader throw us for an unexpected loop that few will see coming. Some may say that the twist ending is a cheap cop out with insufficient clues, but at least it makes for a nice surprise.

1606317,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B00A7F0LDY,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[7, 8]","I really loved a great deal about this movie and I still think it's very worthwhile.  However, there is a flaw that prevented it from becoming a small cult classic.  They try way too hard to keep the audience off balance.  I never thought I would call that a flaw.  This is a very rare instance where they should have kept the plot slightly more derivative and stuck with the formula.  I won't give spoilers.  I just kept thinking through the first half of the movie how much better it seemed than impressions I formed from reviews.  A certain moment arrives in the movie and it simply changes the atmosphere, not because it was implausible, but because it simply tried too hard.  It's like when I made this girl I liked in college two cheesecakes for her birthday.  I was completely genuine, the cheesecakes were awesome, but sometimes it's just too much and you can guess the effect.THE GOOD: With that out of the way, I want to say how much this movie really had going for it.  Crystal Reed is very, very good as the creepy quiet girl with the crush.  Yet, in the fantasy scene where she imagines herself with confidence, the transformation is astounding and she is so gorgeous and nice it's heartbreaking.  It's just a fleeting glimpse for the audience to see what could be, but isn't.  Lucas Till as the object of her desire is also terrific.  The temptation to turn him into such an adonis that the audience secretly hates him is thankfully avoided.  He is appropriately handsome enough to attract a fanatic admirer, athletic and sympathetic.  I have loved Sarah Bolger ever since I saw her in Tudors and she definitely isn't a disappointment in this movie.  All the performances were spot on and deserve all the praise that can be given.  Crystal Reed as the primary is really the one that sells it though.  The characters and plot are really well fleshed out and would have carried the movie well without one or two extra twists.  I really thought the music soundtrack to this movie was great too.  All in all a terrific movie regardless with much to recommend it.THE PLOT:  It starts simple enough that I don't have to give a lot of details.  A high school soccer star attracts a ardent admirer (some would say stocker).  At conflict is the soccer star's popular and beautiful female friend who is trying hard to be more to him than just a friend. The popular girl becomes an obvious rival and obstruction to the admirer from afar.

It's swifter than the eye can capture, and it's more sinister than any thuggish attack could ever be.After a shocker of an opening sequence, the movie proceeds at a slower pace for a while. We see the very socially awkward and involute Bess yearning after the handsome jock in her school. The tension builds as we wonder how far her obsession has taken her in the past and is taking her in the present. Almost everyone is suspect though.This is a good effort at a psychological thriller. The protagonists really talk with each other - or at least exchange more telling texts. So we get to know them better than we do in the average thriller that's being cranked out. Their motivations aren't always very clear or consistent, and the writers perhaps did some reaching for a different, interesting resolution. But I think you'll find this movie worth your time.One warning: Don't look too closely at the jacket of the DVD, so no part of the ending will be revealed to you.",4,Where Death Strikes with Shocking Suddenness,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,1080,"['know', 'coming', 'when', 'homicide', 'hits', 'movie', 'speed', 'rattlesnake', 'strike', 'swifter', 'eye', 'can', 'capture', 'more', 'sinister', 'thuggish', 'attack', 'could', 'ever', 'be.After', 'shocker', 'opening', 'sequence', 'movie', 'proceeds', 'slower', 'pace', 'while', 'see', 'very', 'socially', 'awkward', 'involute', 'Bess', 'yearning', 'handsome', 'jock', 'school', 'tension', 'wonder', 'how', 'far', 'obsession', 'taken', 'past', 'taking', 'present', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'suspect', 'though.This', 'good', 'effort', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'protagonists', 'really', 'talk', 'other', 'least', 'exchange', 'more', 'telling', 'texts', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'do', 'average', 'thriller', 'being', 'cranked', 'out', 'motivations', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'very', 'clear', 'consistent', 'writers', 'perhaps', 'did', 'reaching', 'different', 'interesting', 'resolution', 'think', ""'ll"", 'find', 'movie', 'time.One', 'warning', 'Do', ""n't"", 'look', 'too', 'closely', 'jacket', 'DVD', 'part', 'ending', 'will', 'be', 'revealed']",Crush

1606321,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00A7F0LDY,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 3]","The film centers around Bess (Crystal Reed) and her crush on Scott (Lucas Till). Bess is the socially awkward new kid. She seemingly lives alone in a house while working at a book store. Scott has looks, brains, and athletic ability. All the girls drool over him. Jules (Sarah Bolger) is his girlfriend who he breaks up with because he needs to concentrate. (Seriously, can you believe a guy wrote this?)Other people include teammate Casey (Preston Davis) who believes Scott is a ball hog. Scott's dad is protective and is always going out to work. And Jeffrey (Reid Ewing) has a crush on Bess. Their relationship is encouraged by an older woman and confidant (Meredith Salenger) who works at the bookshop.Accidents happen to people around Scott. We get to see the arm or hand of the person who is revealed to us about an hour into the film when our fairly decent mystery turns into ""Misery.""I couldn't help think that the song ""Love Stinks"" would have made a good title track had they made this film 30 years ago...before the target audience existed. The film covers the many aspect of teen angst as we see it cross the line from ""cute to creepy."" As part of the older crowd, I had to laugh when two teens standing on opposites sides of a glass door opt to have a conversation by texting. Open your mouths!At one point Scott finds a note in his locker. The movie didn't give me tie to read it. I had to pause the film.I like quirky crush films where we know who the killer is and see the odd if not comical things she does. This isn't that film and it would have worked better my way. This is a film for those girls whose first crush still weighs heavy.Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb. No nudity.
