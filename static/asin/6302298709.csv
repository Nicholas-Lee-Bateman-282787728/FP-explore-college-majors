Judd Nelson and Bill Paxton are great actors and really try hard to work with what they have or I wouldn't even give it two stars. Want to watch some good unusual SciFi?

306416,A2O7P0578BBFBB,6302298709,K. Doyle,"[1, 1]","I found this new for $3 at Big Lots, but I'm afraid it wasn't even worth that.  I don't know what kind of sense of humor you need to have to find this funny, but whatever it is it's clear I don't have it, and am no doubt better off because of it.Perhaps writer/director Adam Rifkin fancied himself a cross between David Lynch and John Waters, but it ends up an extraordinarily lame and humorless imitation, with the worthwhile features of neither.  The movie would be full of ""droll"" surrealist or absurdist humor, if anything in it was actually the least bit funny.  The protagonist is intentionally a incredibly lousy comedian, but everything about this movie is about as funny as the complete dud jokes he tells-- I felt about the way the deadpan patrons of Sid's nightclub look at the beginning of the movie.  Painfully unfunny to the point that I couldn't even tell what was *supposed* to be funny, and that which was apparently supposed to be shocking was simply pathetic in the attempt (except the necrophilia, which was a little on the sick side for my tastes).I can laugh at a lot, I find much humor in Lynch and Waters for instance, and can at least understand what is supposed to be funny in movies like ""Airplane,"" though I find it mostly to be an endless collection of ""groaners.""  I don't offend or shock easily, but perhaps that's the problem here.  Frankly, I couldn't even identify something worth groaning about.  And I found Bill Paxton's hyperactive screaming character mostly just annoying.  In the hopes that I would find at least SOMETHING in the movie funny I sat through it to the end, and even when the ""jokes"" were supposed have gotten better at the very end (I could tell that much at least), still found nothing redeeming.  The director's ""introduction"" extra was incredibly amateurish and lame as well.The Q&A; extra reveals that his motivation may have been to make the viewer uncomfortable and resent him for it (based on a feeling he got from a friend who did a bad standup gig), but I wouldn't say it even had that effect on me-- it didn't have the fascination of a train wreck, more like watching the paint dry on a lead balloon.Even the surreal world that sets the stage is poorly done, with the overuse of the same droll ""Blumps"" product gags (they might as well have used, ACME), bad tv programs, an itchy & scratchy cartoon equivalent, Dr. Scurvy reminds of the dentist in Little Shop of Horrors (but far less funny), everything here has been done much better elsewhere.",1,Beneath the valley of the UltraLame,1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,2509,"['found', 'new', '3', 'Big', 'Lots', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'worth', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'sense', 'humor', 'need', 'have', 'find', 'funny', 'clear', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'am', 'doubt', 'better', 'it.Perhaps', 'writer/director', 'Adam', 'Rifkin', 'fancied', 'cross', 'David', 'Lynch', 'John', 'Waters', 'up', 'extraordinarily', 'lame', 'humorless', 'imitation', 'worthwhile', 'features', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'full', 'droll', 'surrealist', 'absurdist', 'humor', 'anything', 'was', 'actually', 'least', 'bit', 'funny', 'protagonist', 'intentionally', 'incredibly', 'lousy', 'comedian', 'everything', 'movie', 'as', 'funny', 'complete', 'dud', 'jokes', 'felt', 'way', 'deadpan', 'patrons', 'Sid', 'nightclub', 'look', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Painfully', 'unfunny', 'point', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'what', 'was', '*supposed*', 'be', 'funny', 'was', 'apparently', 'supposed', 'be', 'shocking', 'was', 'simply', 'pathetic', 'attempt', 'necrophilia', 'was', 'little', 'sick', 'side', 'tastes', '.I', 'can', 'laugh', 'lot', 'find', 'much', 'humor', 'Lynch', 'Waters', 'instance', 'can', 'least', 'understand', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'movies', 'Airplane', 'find', 'mostly', 'be', 'endless', 'collection', 'groaners', 'do', ""n't"", 'offend', 'shock', 'easily', 'perhaps', 'problem', 'here', 'Frankly', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'identify', 'something', 'groaning', 'about', 'found', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'hyperactive', 'screaming', 'character', 'mostly', 'just', 'annoying', 'hopes', 'would', 'find', 'least', 'SOMETHING', 'movie', 'funny', 'sat', 'end', 'even', 'when', 'jokes', 'were', 'supposed', 'have', 'gotten', 'better', 'very', 'end', 'could', 'tell', 'that', 'much', 'least', 'still', 'found', 'nothing', 'redeeming', 'director', 'introduction', 'extra', 'was', 'incredibly', 'amateurish', 'lame', 'well.The', 'Q', 'A', 'extra', 'reveals', 'motivation', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'make', 'viewer', 'uncomfortable', 'resent', 'based', 'feeling', 'got', 'friend', 'who', 'did', 'bad', 'standup', 'gig', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'even', 'had', 'effect', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'fascination', 'train', 'wreck', 'more', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', 'lead', 'balloon.Even', 'surreal', 'world', 'stage', 'poorly', 'done', 'overuse', 'same', 'droll', 'Blumps', 'product', 'gags', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'used', 'ACME', 'bad', 'tv', 'programs', 'itchy', 'scratchy', 'cartoon', 'equivalent', 'Dr.', 'Scurvy', 'dentist', 'Little', 'Shop', 'Horrors', 'far', 'less', 'funny', 'everything', 'here', 'been', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'elsewhere']",Dark Backward VHS

A garbageman named Marty who aspires to be a comedian (but isn't at all funny) develops a physical deformity that makes him a hit (but he still isn't funny). The bad jokes are bad enough that you have to laugh. And the cast includes a lot of people you know in roles that are unlike anything you've ever seen them do. For example, James Caan plays an inept doctor who sees the arm growing out of Marty's back and puts a small bandage on it.

306418,A3PKYCD2WJL94H,6302298709,"M. Williams ""Ghost Writer""","[9, 9]","Cult director Adam Rifkin (Never on a Tuesday, The Chase, Detroit Rock City) delivers once more. Those of you familiar with his work will undoubtedly be familiar with his oddball characters and outlandish plots. For those of you new to his work, 'The Dark Backward' is the best place to begin.Marty Malt (Judd Nelson) is the worst stand-up comic in the entire world. He is equally terrible at his day job, a garbage collector. It seems that Marty is not destined for stardom ... until one day something strange happens that changes his life forever.His accordian playing, garbage-collecting co-worker, Gus (Bill Paxton), notices a lump growing out of Marty's back while they are doing the rounds. This odd growth is diagnosed by the disturbingly incompetent Doctor Scurvey (James Caan) as a third arm.What would normally be an embarrassingly freakish human deformity, turns out to be Marty's comedic calling. Before, Gus was his sole fan; now he has a mass following. Enter the slimy Dirk Delta (Rob Lowe), who offers Marty the chance of Holywood stardom. So begins a successful career in comedy ... ?Seemingly straight out of a Ray Bradbury short tale, Rifkin's film is furnished with carnivalesque characters. You will be astounded and revolted by characters like 'the fat woman', 'the muscle man', and 'the human xylophones'. Rob Lowe is unrecognizable in his role as slick Hollywood bigwig (a role he would later reprise in 'Wayne's World' and 'Tommy Boy'). James Caan is frighteningly brilliant as Dr. Scurvey, and leading man, Judd Nelson, puts in his best performance since 'St. Elmo's Fire' and 'The Breakfast Club' (look out for Judd's oddball cameo in Rifkin's 'Never on a Tuesday').'The Dark Backwards' is arguably Rifkin's best film, not having directed anything since to equal it. It is certainly his strangest movie since 'Never on a Tuesday'. If you are a fan of cult movie directors like David Lynch and John Waters, check this film out. If you are afraid of zombies, freaks, midgets and men with three arms I suggest you look elsewhere.Cast: Judd Nelson, Bill Paxton, Rob Lowe, James Caan, Lara Flynn Boyle, Wayne Newton, et al",5,Dark Comedy and Carnivalesque,1080950400,"04 3, 2004",2004,2144,"['Cult', 'director', 'Adam', 'Rifkin', 'Never', 'Tuesday', 'Chase', 'Detroit', 'Rock', 'City', 'once', 'more', 'familiar', 'work', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'be', 'familiar', 'oddball', 'characters', 'outlandish', 'plots', 'new', 'work', 'Dark', 'Backward', 'best', 'place', 'begin.Marty', 'Malt', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'worst', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'entire', 'world', 'equally', 'terrible', 'day', 'job', 'garbage', 'collector', 'Marty', 'not', 'destined', 'stardom', 'one', 'day', 'something', 'strange', 'life', 'forever.His', 'accordian', 'playing', 'garbage-collecting', 'co-worker', 'Gus', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'lump', 'growing', 'Marty', 'back', 'are', 'doing', 'rounds', 'odd', 'growth', 'diagnosed', 'disturbingly', 'incompetent', 'Doctor', 'Scurvey', 'James', 'Caan', 'third', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'embarrassingly', 'freakish', 'human', 'deformity', 'out', 'be', 'Marty', 'comedic', 'calling', 'Gus', 'was', 'sole', 'fan', 'now', 'mass', 'following', 'Enter', 'slimy', 'Dirk', 'Delta', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'who', 'Marty', 'chance', 'Holywood', 'stardom', 'So', 'successful', 'career', 'comedy', 'Seemingly', 'straight', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'short', 'tale', 'Rifkin', 'film', 'furnished', 'carnivalesque', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'astounded', 'revolted', 'characters', ""'the"", 'fat', 'woman', 'muscle', 'man', 'human', 'xylophones', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'unrecognizable', 'role', 'slick', 'Hollywood', 'bigwig', 'role', 'would', 'later', 'reprise', ""'Wayne"", 'World', 'Boy', 'James', 'Caan', 'frighteningly', 'brilliant', 'Dr.', 'Scurvey', 'leading', 'man', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'best', 'performance', ""'St"", 'Elmo', 'Fire', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'look', 'out', 'Judd', 'oddball', 'cameo', 'Rifkin', ""'Never"", 'Tuesday', 'Dark', 'Backwards', 'arguably', 'Rifkin', 'best', 'film', 'not', 'having', 'directed', 'anything', 'equal', 'certainly', 'strangest', 'movie', ""'Never"", 'Tuesday', 'are', 'fan', 'cult', 'movie', 'directors', 'David', 'Lynch', 'John', 'Waters', 'check', 'film', 'out', 'are', 'afraid', 'zombies', 'freaks', 'midgets', 'men', 'three', 'arms', 'suggest', 'look', 'elsewhere.Cast', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'James', 'Caan', 'Lara', 'Flynn', 'Boyle', 'Wayne', 'Newton', 'al']",Dark Backward VHS

It's not scary at all so I don't know why it's considered a comedic horror but it has its moments. What wins you over is Judd Nelson as the lead character.

306420,AXV9GS0TMSVW,6302298709,Poor Napoleon,"[0, 0]","The Dark Backward is a strange movie.  I remember being somewhat curious when the movie came out.  As I was a mere teenager at the time, I didn't see it then and only got bits and pieces from fellow family members.  They were dissapointed, but nonetheless took perverse pleasure in the pure insanity of the film.  It might be worthy of cult status.  That said, it's not perfect, but between Bill Paxton and Adam Rifkin, there's something sickningly genuis about the film, in spite of its flaws.The film deals with a struggling comedian played by Nelson who is insanely bad.  Yet his ""friend,"" played by Bill Paxton cheers him on, taking a sick pleasure in it.  In the midst of all this, Nelson's character grows a third arm.  All sorts of insanity ensues.  It doesn't all work.  The thing that keeps me coming back to the movie (and at times looking away) is Bill Paxton.  His performance is profane and hilarious.  He really gets so deep into his character that it's almost perverse to watch what he does.  If the film was better received upon its release, Paxton would've garnered much praise.But the film seems disjointed and that keeps it just short of being revisited by cult film enthusiasts.  Yet its strange nature makes it worth a watch on its own.  Perhaps the strangest thing about the film, to me (besides Wayne Newton), was the fact that Rifkin manages to craft a good moral and theme to the film in the end - something you usually don't see with such a dark comic film.  It's hard to reccommend for repeat viewings, but if you're into the bizarre, sometimes sick and twisted - this film is worth a viewing.

306421,A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,6302298709,"Schtinky ""Schtinky""","[18, 19]","The Dark Backward is a sickly twisted comedy of ridiculous and nauseatingly gross proportions that will leave you laughing until you cry and barfing up your lunch.Judd Nelson plays Marty Malt, an extremely bad BAD stand up comedian.  Don't expect the Judd Nelson from The Breakfast Club either; as Marty he is a sweaty, Jeffrey Combs type character and plays the role very, very well.  His best friend is Gus, played expertly by Bill Paxton, a greasy and disgusting accordion player whose girlfriend Nicolette weighs over 400 pounds.Marty and Gus work as Trash Collectors during the day, and while working Gus spies a lump on Marty's back, like a boil.  Marty goes to visit Dr. Scurvy, outlandishly played by James Caan, who puts a band-aid over it and charges Marty $200.00.Gus manages to bring talent scout Jackie Chrome (played by Wayne Newton) in to hear Marty's routine, and Jackie walks out on it, telling Gus that Marty is the worst comedian he has ever heard.  Marty is crushed but Gus keeps his good spirits about it all.  Marty's ""lump"" grows some more, and Gus discovers he now has a hand growing out of his back, like a baby's hand.  When Marty goes to see Dr. Scurvy again, Dr. Scurvy again places a band-aid over the baby hand and accuses Marty of ""picking at it"".  Marty's waitress girlfriend, Rosarita, played by Laura Flynn Boyle, leaves him because she can't date a man with a three hands.The hand grows into a full sized arm, and Jackie Chrome winds out taking on Marty as a client, turning him into Desi The Three Armed Wonder Comedian.  Gus joins up as a sidekick to play his accordion inbetween Marty's terrible jokes.  Watch for Rob Lowe to show up in a cameo role as Hollywood Bigwig Dirk Delta.This is a tongue in cheek, very dark comedy with scenes of pure grossness.  The entire background of the film is seedy, filthy, and nauseating.  From the grimy offices of Dr. Scurvy to Marty's mother's apartment where he clips her toenails while she chainsmokes though on oxygen, to the trash filled streets they are supposed to be cleaning, to the seedy bars and lounges, it is plain that there is a great amount of detail focused onto the overall atmosphere of the film, setting the perfect mood for the plot.  Pay attention!All throughout the movie we see the omnipresent Blump's, a company so encompassing that it owns the garbage company Gus and Marty work for, and also manufactures such delicacies as Liquid Bacon.  Go ahead and make the connection, I did.  Gus is the grossest imaginable character, even finding an old lunch pail in the landfill, opening it up, and eating the sandwich that was inside.  Gus will eat anything.  Also not to be missed is Marjorie Zipp and the Human Xylophone as they audition in Jackie Chrome's office.  There are some hilarious twists in the plot, and an ironic ending, and some amazingly good acting throughout from this stellar cast.The overall filth of the atmosphere and the disgusting physical and mental attributes of the characters make for one bizarre flick.  Very funny movie, but only for those with sick and twisted funny bones.  I wish it was available on DVD.

306423,A2JZ95HC089B9Z,6302298709,"S Shepark ""redclayrambler""","[0, 3]","Thank you so much for the upcoming DVD release!! ""The Dark Backward"" is one of the darkest, most transgressive, brilliant films of the 80s and it has a significant cult reputation. The DVD release is long overdue. I searched endlessly to find my VHS copy and ended up paying a fortune on ebay. I am soooo glad it is finally coming out.I am an indie film maker myself and I was very influenced by the look and feel of this film, and have watched it over and over. It is beautifully textured and dense with sinister imagery and sound that really gives it an ""out there"", disturbing feel.It makes me a bit sad, however. When a film is released to DVD it means it is becoming more a public property for every average joe who doesn't know or respect film and less ""our film"" (the secret of film buffs who have good taste). Sad, because now its greatness will be diluted and every idiot will rent it, thinking its an Adam Sandler comedy or something, and not understand or appreciate it.It doesn't matter though, confrontation art is not meant to be understood by a mass audience.",5,DVD release!!!!!!!
