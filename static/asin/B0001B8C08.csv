798773,A3QNER0M9CJ22N,B0001B8C08,"Anna Robb ""SaraShaw""","[4, 5]","Sarah Jessica Parker stars as a teenager having trouble getting over the death of her father. As this movie starts Lori is upset that her mother is considering getting married to someone else given the premature death of her father just a few years ago. All of that is put on hold when the girl witnesses a small plane crash while she is out riding her horse one day. She goes over to check on the two in the plane crash and gets help. After help arrives and she is dismissed - while walking back home - she discovers the pilot (Terry) walking though the woods. She takes him to the hospital to get him help and they have a great conversation -- only eventually she discovers that Terry is dead and she has been talking to a goast. Both are shocked and Lori passes out.Cut to a few weeks later she is sure she was dreaming or something but Terry shows up. He apparently went to his funeral and has discovered that she is the only one that can see him. Accordingly he needs her to contact his family etc. Also since it has now been weeks he is sure that she must play a role in the reason he has not moved on. So they embark on trying to figure out why he hasn't moved on and how to get that to happen. While the two try to do this they fall in love and also the goast helps Lori be a bit more accepting of her mother's decision to marry another man and to accept her dad's death.Eventually the goast does move on and there is a great twist at the end that excellently explains how this girl could have been talking to a goast. It is also implied that she had this experience as a direct result of her dead father trying to send her a message about letting go. Additionally the pilot is not dead (although the plane crash was real) and Lori now has the opportunity to meet the real man and embark on a relationship with him.This is not a fluf movie. I thought the scripting was thoughtful and accurate. For example when the girl first determines that the goast is real - she is scared! As anyone would be. He has to calm her down. Too many fluf movies such as ""just like heaven"" have the characters totally accepting of seeing a goast -- for plot purposes. Another issue that wasn't ignored was that Terry was older than her and he was aware of that. Both actors do a wonderful job. Sarah Jessica Parker was wonderful here.I wish that Hollywood would remake this well with great stars of today such as Kirsten Stewart / Wentworth Miller. It was a truely smart romantic story with an unexpected message.",5,Excellent Movie,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,2501,"['Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'teenager', 'having', 'trouble', 'getting', 'death', 'father', 'movie', 'Lori', 'upset', 'mother', 'considering', 'getting', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'given', 'premature', 'death', 'father', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'put', 'hold', 'when', 'girl', 'small', 'plane', 'crash', 'out', 'riding', 'horse', 'one', 'day', 'check', 'two', 'plane', 'crash', 'help', 'help', 'arrives', 'dismissed', 'walking', 'back', 'home', 'pilot', 'Terry', 'walking', 'woods', 'hospital', 'get', 'help', 'have', 'great', 'conversation', 'only', 'eventually', 'Terry', 'dead', 'been', 'talking', 'goast', 'are', 'shocked', 'Lori', 'out.Cut', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'sure', 'was', 'dreaming', 'something', 'Terry', 'up', 'apparently', 'went', 'funeral', 'discovered', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'Accordingly', 'contact', 'family', 'etc', 'Also', 'now', 'been', 'weeks', 'sure', 'must', 'play', 'role', 'reason', 'not', 'moved', 'embark', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', ""n't"", 'moved', 'how', 'get', 'happen', 'two', 'try', 'do', 'fall', 'love', 'also', 'goast', 'Lori', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'accepting', 'mother', 'decision', 'marry', 'man', 'accept', 'dad', 'death.Eventually', 'goast', 'move', 'great', 'twist', 'end', 'excellently', 'how', 'girl', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'talking', 'goast', 'also', 'implied', 'had', 'experience', 'direct', 'result', 'dead', 'father', 'trying', 'send', 'message', 'letting', 'go', 'Additionally', 'pilot', 'not', 'dead', 'plane', 'crash', 'was', 'real', 'Lori', 'now', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'real', 'man', 'embark', 'relationship', 'him.This', 'not', 'fluf', 'movie', 'thought', 'scripting', 'was', 'thoughtful', 'accurate', 'example', 'when', 'girl', 'first', 'goast', 'real', 'scared', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'calm', 'down', 'Too', 'many', 'fluf', 'movies', 'such', 'just', 'heaven', 'have', 'characters', 'totally', 'accepting', 'seeing', 'goast', 'plot', 'purposes', 'issue', 'was', ""n't"", 'ignored', 'was', 'Terry', 'was', 'older', 'was', 'aware', 'actors', 'do', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'was', 'wonderful', 'here.I', 'wish', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'remake', 'well', 'great', 'stars', 'today', 'such', 'Kirsten', 'Stewart', '/', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'was', 'truely', 'smart', 'romantic', 'story', 'unexpected', 'message']",N/A

I seriously doubt that a movie of this kind could be made today because current audiences seem to expect and only respond to ""in your face"" entertainment. Somewhere Tomorrow is a truly exceptional film filled with magic and wonder! Highly recommended to viewers who enjoy simple, straight forward ""fairytales"" come to life. A great date movie and a very cool early 80's time capsule!I would like to note that there are several versions of this film available on DVD. I am only familiar with the 89 minute release from ""Legacy Entertainment"". I'm mentioning this fact because the running times listed for this film range from 89 minutes to 91 minutes depending on which DVD you buy. I have yet to determine if there's actually 2 extra minutes of footage contained in the 91 minute version. My guess is that it has been time expanded or the production company is taking into consideration the ""menu"" or ""titles"" as part of the running time.Unfortunately the transfer quality for the ""Legacy Entertainment"" version is very poor. I have not tried one of the other releases to compare quality. I would also recommend staying away from most other titles released by ""Legacy Entertainment"" because the quality can be quite horrible (worse than if you used an old VHS rental tape as the master).I can only give three stars because of the poor DVD transfer.",3,Lost 80's gem!

It is so soft that I had to put one of my stereo speakers to my ear to hear it.  Hopefully when you buy it through Amazon you will get decent volume.The plot fits in pretty well with all of the books about life after death, beginning with Raymond Moody's Life After Life and, even before that, Seth Speaks, and running right through to the excellent books by Michael Newton.  The premise is that after we die we leave our bodies and continue to exist.  Don't expect too close an agreement with those books, though.  This is, after all, just a story.  There is no claim to accuracy.There is a plane crash.  It appears that both young men in the plane survived the crash, but then we see scenes indicating that one of the men died.  Sarah Jessica Parker's character is the only person who sees him, apparently as a ghost.  And she falls in love with him.Why hasn't he gone on to Heaven, or wherever the dead are supposed to go?  Is he there to help split up the budding romance between Sarah's mom and her cop boyfriend?  Might he be there just to calm Sarah down about the upcoming marriage her mom is contemplating?  Sarah is deeply hurt by the possibility that her mom may forget Sarah's deceased father and marry another man.There is a surprise ending.  I won't ruin it for you, but all I will say is that before you reach the last few minutes of the film, you don't know everything, or as Yogi said, It ain't over til it's over.It's really a heartwarming story.  I disagree with the other reviewer on this site, who described this film as a bit of fluff.  It is more than that.  I also notice that the other reviewer gave it the same five star rating that I did, so perhaps he sees it as more than just a bit of fluff.  It's a beautiful story.How close is it to reality?

Romance weaves with the supernatural in this sensitive tale of a fate with circumstance. Sarah Jessica Parker (Sex in the City) plays a young girl, mourning over the loss of her father. Nothing it seems can break her sorrow. Fate intervenes one day in the form of a small plane crash that takes the life of a young man, who rather than ascending to the great beyond, finds himself still on earth and the object of Sarah Jessica Parker's affections. Together they must find out why he remains earthbound and unravel the mystery. Will answers be found ? Can love survive beyond death ? You will be touched by the answers as this compelling drama unfolds.I'd guess the film is/was made for TV. Also look for Elizabeth Shue, in her film debut. A interesting note is Sarah Jessica Parker performs two onscreen songs in the film. (Not too shabby I might add.) One with her male co-star playing guitar and a solo accompanied by a piano.

798783,A1K94LXX833JTT,B0001B8C08,Sanpete,"[1, 1]","This is a review of the Digiview edition of this movie, which is still available here and there, for very little cash.  The picture quality of this version is OK, about what you'd expect for the price, i.e. a little soft, somewhat grainy, colors not very saturated, but still fine to watch for the story.  The sound is clear mono (if it's stereo, as the box says, I couldn't detect it), with a little static in a couple places but otherwise OK.  The production values for a low budget film are pretty good.  There are at the moment a couple other editions available through Amazon, including one that a reviewer (Luke73) says is better (theGuilty Pleasures/Media Blastersrelease), so it might be worth the extra cash for you if you're particular.Other reviews do a good job explaining the plot.  I'll just add that this is apparently pitched at a high school age audience but is well enough done for older folks to enjoy, if you go in for this kind of thing.  It's a romantic comedy/drama with some serious themes about death treated in a way that's very optimistic, to say the least.  I thought it had some originality, some good humor, no gaping holes that you can't fill in with a little effort, if you're so inclined.  Don't be put off by the singing that runs over the menu at the beginning.  The movie's better than that (though I do wonder why the singing ended up in it at all).  Despite what the box says, this is rated PG, has a ""family film"" feel, with just a little of what might be considered very mild adult situations.If you like this one and want to see something with some similar themes, but pitched at a far higher level, try Truly, Madly, Deeply (unfortunately hard to find at the moment).",4,Worth the price,1159488000,"09 29, 2006",2006,1709,"['review', 'Digiview', 'edition', 'movie', 'still', 'available', 'here', 'there', 'very', 'little', 'cash', 'picture', 'quality', 'version', 'OK', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'price', 'i.e', 'little', 'soft', 'somewhat', 'grainy', 'colors', 'not', 'very', 'saturated', 'still', 'fine', 'watch', 'story', 'sound', 'clear', 'mono', 'stereo', 'box', 'could', ""n't"", 'detect', 'little', 'static', 'couple', 'places', 'otherwise', 'OK', 'production', 'values', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'moment', 'couple', 'other', 'editions', 'available', 'Amazon', 'including', 'one', 'reviewer', 'Luke73', 'better', 'theGuilty', 'Pleasures/Media', 'Blastersrelease', 'might', 'be', 'extra', 'cash', ""'re"", 'particular.Other', 'reviews', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'plot', ""'ll"", 'just', 'add', 'apparently', 'pitched', 'high', 'school', 'age', 'audience', 'well', 'enough', 'done', 'older', 'folks', 'enjoy', 'go', 'kind', 'thing', 'romantic', 'comedy/drama', 'serious', 'themes', 'death', 'treated', 'way', 'very', 'optimistic', 'say', 'least', 'thought', 'had', 'originality', 'good', 'humor', 'gaping', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fill', 'little', 'effort', ""'re"", 'so', 'inclined', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'singing', 'menu', 'beginning', 'movie', 'better', 'do', 'wonder', 'why', 'singing', 'ended', 'up', 'what', 'box', 'rated', 'PG', 'family', 'film', 'feel', 'just', 'little', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'very', 'mild', 'adult', 'situations.If', 'one', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'similar', 'themes', 'pitched', 'far', 'higher', 'level', 'try', 'Truly', 'Madly', 'Deeply', 'unfortunately', 'hard', 'find', 'moment']",N/A
