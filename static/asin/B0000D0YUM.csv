The story is about a man who loses his wife just as they leave the church. I would have loved to have seen the bloopers, because there were many fun actors and I'm sure that laughs weren't few. The story starts sadly and ends with a person dying for another. It's a melodrama and I loved it! It's a Thanksgiving kind of movie, but without the football players.",5,Warms the Heart,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",2007,425,"['as', 'sweet', 'halmark', 'card', 'loved', 'halmark', 'store', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'just', 'leave', 'church', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'bloopers', 'were', 'many', 'fun', 'actors', ""'m"", 'sure', 'laughs', 'were', ""n't"", 'few', 'story', 'sadly', 'person', 'dying', 'melodrama', 'loved', 'Thanksgiving', 'kind', 'movie', 'football', 'players']",Book Of Days

The acting in this movie was decent. The story line was a bit unusual. Didn't have a lot of action or special effects. However it will make you think and maybe feel something. Especially if you have ever lost someone that you loved dearly. And if you ever questioned God about why.Sincerely yours,Kristy Star Sisk",5,It was in excellent condition and was an O.K. movie,1231632000,"01 11, 2009",2009,416,"['like', 'Wil', 'Wheaton', 'Mainly', 'reasons', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Stand', 'Me', 'books', 'web', 'blog', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'decent', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'bit', 'unusual', 'Did', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'However', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'maybe', 'feel', 'something', 'Especially', 'have', 'ever', 'lost', 'someone', 'loved', 'dearly', 'ever', 'questioned', 'God', 'why.Sincerely', 'yours', 'Kristy', 'Star', 'Sisk']",Book Of Days
