Dubs are ""best available source"" and can vary from very good to only fair.In the most interesting made-for-TVer A CHRISTMAS WITHOUT SNOW, a divorcee from Nebraska relocates to San Francisco, where she rediscovers the spirit of Christmas through her inner-city church's choir. Their plans to perform Handel's Messiah are disrupted by vandalism.Zoe Jensen (Learned) temporarily leaves her young son with his worried grandma and heads west to seek a teaching job. With no positions available, Zoe does clerical work at a number of offices. She joins a choir led by taskmaster Ephraim Adams (Houseman). As they rehearse a challenging Christmas concert program, tensions arise within the group.Classically-trained Muriel (Curtin) bristles when she's passed over as solo soprano in favor of an amateur with a much softer voice. Elderly Inez (Nelson), a member for decades, can no longer carry a tune. Mr. Adams deftly handles both these issues, but little can be done when the church's pipe organ is severely damaged by an unknown attacker.A young African-American baritone is arrested by police after being wrongly accused of the crime by another member. Worse, the cheesy electronic organ on 60 days trial keeps receiving police radio calls during mass! With no repair company available in time and their substitute organ malfunctioning, things look pretty bleak. And then, Mr. Adams suffers a stroke...Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.6) A Christmas Without Snow (TV-1980) - Michael Learned/John Houseman/James Cromwell/Valerie Curtin/Calvin Levels/Ruth Nelson/Ed Bogas",4,"Ephraim Adams: ""There is no higher reason for singing than the love of doing it.""",1261699200,"12 25, 2009",2009,1703,"['Budget', 'label', 'discs', 'such', 'offer', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'other', 'bonus', 'features', 'Dubs', 'are', 'best', 'available', 'source', 'can', 'vary', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'fair.In', 'most', 'interesting', 'made-for-TVer', 'A', 'CHRISTMAS', 'WITHOUT', 'SNOW', 'divorcee', 'Nebraska', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'spirit', 'Christmas', 'inner-city', 'church', 'choir', 'plans', 'perform', 'Handel', 'Messiah', 'are', 'disrupted', 'vandalism.Zoe', 'Jensen', 'Learned', 'temporarily', 'young', 'son', 'worried', 'grandma', 'heads', 'west', 'seek', 'teaching', 'job', 'positions', 'available', 'Zoe', 'clerical', 'work', 'number', 'offices', 'choir', 'led', 'taskmaster', 'Ephraim', 'Adams', 'Houseman', 'rehearse', 'challenging', 'Christmas', 'concert', 'program', 'tensions', 'arise', 'group.Classically-trained', 'Muriel', 'Curtin', 'when', 'passed', 'solo', 'soprano', 'favor', 'amateur', 'much', 'softer', 'voice', 'Elderly', 'Inez', 'Nelson', 'member', 'decades', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'carry', 'tune', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'deftly', 'issues', 'little', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'when', 'church', 'pipe', 'organ', 'severely', 'damaged', 'unknown', 'attacker.A', 'young', 'African-American', 'baritone', 'arrested', 'police', 'being', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'crime', 'member', 'Worse', 'cheesy', 'electronic', 'organ', '60', 'days', 'trial', 'keeps', 'receiving', 'police', 'radio', 'mass', 'repair', 'company', 'available', 'time', 'substitute', 'malfunctioning', 'things', 'look', 'pretty', 'bleak', 'then', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'stroke', 'Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '6.6', 'Christmas', 'Without', 'Snow', 'TV-1980', 'Michael', 'Learned/John', 'Houseman/James', 'Cromwell/Valerie', 'Curtin/Calvin', 'Levels/Ruth', 'Nelson/Ed', 'Bogas']",N/A

675343,AVVXC6B1O3CLU,B00005QJHV,Milkyway Movie Lover,"[1, 1]","Before I can talk about the movie I think its really important to alert people that this particular offering of the DVD comes NOT in a case but a thin cheap cardboard outter shell that would be more precisely decribed as hard paper. So if you're like me and collect movies and keep them on shelves, you won't be able to find this one easily or ever see what it is unless you notice it squeezed in there almost hidden and pull it out to see what it is. I was pretty disappointed by that alone because if they arent going to give you a case it seems only fair someone should warn you. I blame Amazon for not making it known on their site when buying it. So my first recommendation is to buy another version, its the same movie just different art, and no case.  The movie itself has practically nothing to do with Christmas, a VERY misleading title. You expect some Christmas connections, maybe a tree decorated or some Christmas related anything, but the closest it comes is that the choir is supposed to be learning their song for the Christmas service but other than that small mention, its just a story line someone came up with to make a movie. add some dramatic scenes and tie a few others together and whip it all together and get suckers like me to buy it thinking they're getting a Christmas movie.  But dont get me wrong, the key character does a fine acting job and there is a nice involvement with the other people in the choir, and in fairness the total acting of them collectively make it seem Very Believable, great casting really made it seem like a real choir bunch, not some perfect star actors but an almost motly crew of average every day people like you and me. It wasnt a bad movie, I kept watching it, didn't care for the preacher though, he's better in other roles but its just my opinion, but hey, its my review. It was ok like I said, but I probably wont ever watch it again, just not enough fun.  I guess if you like a dramatic tale more than a memorable experience then go for it. but although it does deserve 3 stars, as far as being one to own, I'd say 2 stars, barely, in that department. And before I forget to mention, the video transfer truly sucks! at times the bottom of the picture flips up like on an olf 8 mm projector and you realize they transfered it in some low cost, rapid fire, screwed up, cheapo chintzy method which should never be done if being sold for money, might be acceptable if it was a free handout, but if you paid for it you deserve better!",3,Not a Christmas movie,1257552000,"11 7, 2009",2009,2494,"['can', 'talk', 'movie', 'think', 'really', 'important', 'alert', 'people', 'particular', 'offering', 'DVD', 'NOT', 'case', 'thin', 'cheap', 'cardboard', 'outter', 'shell', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'precisely', 'decribed', 'hard', 'paper', 'So', ""'re"", 'collect', 'movies', 'keep', 'shelves', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'find', 'one', 'easily', 'ever', 'see', 'what', 'notice', 'squeezed', 'almost', 'hidden', 'pull', 'out', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'pretty', 'disappointed', 'alone', 'arent', 'going', 'give', 'case', 'only', 'fair', 'someone', 'should', 'warn', 'blame', 'Amazon', 'not', 'making', 'known', 'site', 'when', 'buying', 'first', 'recommendation', 'buy', 'version', 'same', 'movie', 'just', 'different', 'art', 'case', 'movie', 'practically', 'nothing', 'do', 'Christmas', 'VERY', 'misleading', 'title', 'expect', 'Christmas', 'connections', 'maybe', 'tree', 'decorated', 'Christmas', 'related', 'anything', 'closest', 'choir', 'supposed', 'be', 'learning', 'song', 'Christmas', 'service', 'other', 'small', 'mention', 'just', 'story', 'line', 'someone', 'came', 'up', 'make', 'movie', 'add', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'tie', 'few', 'others', 'together', 'whip', 'together', 'get', 'suckers', 'buy', 'thinking', ""'re"", 'getting', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'key', 'character', 'fine', 'acting', 'job', 'nice', 'involvement', 'other', 'people', 'choir', 'fairness', 'total', 'acting', 'collectively', 'make', 'seem', 'Very', 'Believable', 'great', 'casting', 'really', 'made', 'seem', 'real', 'choir', 'bunch', 'not', 'perfect', 'star', 'actors', 'almost', 'motly', 'crew', 'average', 'day', 'people', 'wasnt', 'bad', 'movie', 'kept', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'preacher', 'better', 'other', 'roles', 'just', 'opinion', 'hey', 'review', 'was', 'ok', 'said', 'probably', 'wont', 'ever', 'watch', 'again', 'just', 'not', 'enough', 'fun', 'guess', 'like', 'dramatic', 'tale', 'more', 'memorable', 'experience', 'then', 'go', 'deserve', '3', 'stars', 'as', 'far', 'being', 'one', 'own', ""'d"", 'say', '2', 'stars', 'barely', 'department', 'forget', 'mention', 'video', 'transfer', 'truly', 'times', 'bottom', 'picture', 'up', 'olf', '8', 'mm', 'projector', 'realize', 'transfered', 'low', 'cost', 'rapid', 'fire', 'screwed', 'up', 'cheapo', 'chintzy', 'method', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'done', 'being', 'sold', 'money', 'might', 'be', 'acceptable', 'was', 'free', 'handout', 'paid', 'deserve', 'better']",N/A
