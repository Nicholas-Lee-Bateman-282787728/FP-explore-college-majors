The twists and turns kept me interested and wanting to go to the next episode. I just wish they had extended the ending for one more episode but *sigh* they didn't.,4,E's Otherwise,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,261,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'departure', 'what', 'usually', 'watch', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'twists', 'kept', 'interested', 'wanting', 'go', 'next', 'episode', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'extended', 'ending', 'one', 'more', 'episode', '*sigh*', 'did', ""n't""]",E's Otherwise: Complete Collection

1024389,A1LPKQWRHTAHQN,B000J3FBT8,Frankie D,"[0, 0]",This is an enjoyable anime. Good players in it. Good action scences and the art is done well. Only problem is that it did not havea good ending. Nothing was settled. The battle still continues. Still a good anime to watch,4,Cool anime,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,221,"['enjoyable', 'anime', 'Good', 'players', 'Good', 'action', 'scences', 'art', 'done', 'well', 'Only', 'problem', 'did', 'not', 'havea', 'good', 'ending', 'Nothing', 'was', 'settled', 'battle', 'still', 'Still', 'good', 'anime', 'watch']",E's Otherwise: Complete Collection
1024390,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B000J3FBT8,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[2, 2]","Kai is an Esper, aka an E's. He takes a job working for a group of E's soldiers that catch criminal Espers. He does this to get good treatment for his sick sister. He soon discovers that the organization he works for is evil. He abandons them and begins to live with Yuki and his adopted little sister Asuka. He soon learns that life is more than just pain and suffering. His peaceful life is not going to last long. His old comrades are after him, and he has to rescue his little sister from the evil ASHURUM organization.This anime started off very good. It reminded me of S-CRY-ed, which also kind of stunk. The voice acting, animation, and soundtrack are all pretty good in E's Otherwise. I admit that I got it because I saw the impressive voice actors that played roles in it. The story is just a total bomb. It moves really slow, and relationships between the characters never develop. It just cruises along at a mediocre pace and doesn't heat up. The ending is also really hollow. It looks like they ran out of money to finish it or something. I may watch it again and see if my opinion changes. But you shouldn't have to do that to find something enjoyable. I have to admit it, but this is an anime that I should have passed on.",3,Kind of Lame,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,1236,"['Kai', 'Esper', 'aka', 'E', 'job', 'working', 'group', 'E', 'soldiers', 'catch', 'criminal', 'Espers', 'get', 'good', 'treatment', 'sick', 'sister', 'soon', 'organization', 'evil', 'live', 'Yuki', 'adopted', 'little', 'sister', 'Asuka', 'soon', 'life', 'more', 'just', 'pain', 'suffering', 'peaceful', 'life', 'not', 'going', 'last', 'long', 'old', 'comrades', 'are', 'rescue', 'little', 'sister', 'evil', 'ASHURUM', 'organization.This', 'anime', 'started', 'off', 'very', 'good', 'reminded', 'S-CRY-ed', 'also', 'kind', 'stunk', 'voice', 'acting', 'animation', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'E', 'Otherwise', 'admit', 'got', 'saw', 'impressive', 'voice', 'actors', 'played', 'roles', 'story', 'just', 'total', 'bomb', 'really', 'slow', 'relationships', 'characters', 'never', 'develop', 'just', 'along', 'mediocre', 'pace', ""n't"", 'heat', 'up', 'ending', 'also', 'really', 'hollow', 'ran', 'money', 'finish', 'something', 'may', 'watch', 'again', 'see', 'opinion', 'changes', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'do', 'find', 'something', 'enjoyable', 'have', 'admit', 'anime', 'should', 'have', 'passed']",E's Otherwise: Complete Collection
1024391,AFV2584U13XP3,B000J3FBT8,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[1, 1]","I actually felt this was a very entertaining and exciting sci-fi, paranormal anime series and well worth the price.  The stories main character is Kai Kudou is young paranormal psychical boy whose power at first doesn't seem all that great actually begins to build in power that few can equal him in a paranormal psychical battle.  The story is a little in the future with normal people and people with psychical paranormal abilities but people with these abilities are treated with a majority of hatred, fear, and are usually shunned by normal people. Thus ASHURUM is created to supposedly help these special people with their abilities and have them live their lives in the world as a productive and helpful members of society.  Of course there is a darker mission and reason for what ASHURUM does and why they are training the psychical paranormal children with more militaristic and lethal training then they are telling anyone.  The series is dramatic, action packed, with plenty of battles, and a few comedic scenes to lighten the show a a little.  The show reminds me a little of the X-men comics and movies in their telling of the struggles between mutants and normal humans.  The video is clear and clean so no complaints with the picture quality and the voice actors for the subbed and dubbed did a great job so kudos to them.So if you like the animes like X/Clamp or Witch Hunter Robin this series set might be a good choice for your collection as well...",5,An Entertaining Sci-Fi Anime With A Little Morality Story Built In,1225843200,"11 5, 2008",2008,1466,"['actually', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'sci-fi', 'paranormal', 'anime', 'series', 'well', 'price', 'stories', 'main', 'character', 'Kai', 'Kudou', 'young', 'paranormal', 'psychical', 'boy', 'power', 'first', ""n't"", 'seem', 'great', 'actually', 'build', 'power', 'few', 'can', 'equal', 'paranormal', 'psychical', 'battle', 'story', 'little', 'future', 'normal', 'people', 'people', 'psychical', 'paranormal', 'abilities', 'people', 'abilities', 'are', 'treated', 'majority', 'hatred', 'fear', 'are', 'usually', 'shunned', 'normal', 'people', 'Thus', 'ASHURUM', 'created', 'supposedly', 'help', 'special', 'people', 'abilities', 'have', 'live', 'lives', 'world', 'productive', 'helpful', 'members', 'society', 'course', 'darker', 'mission', 'reason', 'what', 'ASHURUM', 'why', 'are', 'training', 'psychical', 'paranormal', 'children', 'more', 'militaristic', 'lethal', 'training', 'then', 'are', 'telling', 'anyone', 'series', 'dramatic', 'action', 'packed', 'plenty', 'battles', 'few', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'lighten', 'show', 'little', 'show', 'little', 'X-men', 'comics', 'movies', 'telling', 'struggles', 'mutants', 'normal', 'humans', 'video', 'clear', 'clean', 'so', 'complaints', 'picture', 'quality', 'voice', 'actors', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'so', 'kudos', 'them.So', 'like', 'animes', 'X/Clamp', 'Witch', 'Hunter', 'Robin', 'series', 'set', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'collection', 'as', 'well']",E's Otherwise: Complete Collection
