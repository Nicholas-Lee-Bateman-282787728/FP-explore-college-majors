O'DELL ""njsquarebear""","[1, 2]","I gave this four stars, probably because there are so FEW Christmas musicals on the market, and because it is interesting to see a filmed version of a stage (off-Broadway) musical, with the interaction between the actors and audience.  That said, I had hoped this show would be better; while I never saw NUNSENSE, my parents did, and raved up and down about the show.  (Ironically this taping seems filled with JUST folks of my parents age, so maybe it is just ME? LOL)  Nuncrackers has its good and amusing moments... though I was disappointed with Rue, I didn't think she added much to the show (though a better script would have helped).  John Ritter adds nothing to this show - except his name and face, really, and was the big disapointment!  The songs aren't bad, though none are all that great either... the supporting staff of other 'nuns' and 'students' do a great job with the material they were given (script and songs).  I suppose I'd rate this - if I could, really - at 3-1/2 stars.",4,At times amusing... enjoyable holiday fare...,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,995,"['gave', 'four', 'stars', 'probably', 'are', 'so', 'FEW', 'Christmas', 'musicals', 'market', 'interesting', 'see', 'filmed', 'version', 'stage', 'off-Broadway', 'musical', 'interaction', 'actors', 'audience', 'said', 'had', 'hoped', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'never', 'saw', 'NUNSENSE', 'parents', 'did', 'raved', 'up', 'down', 'show', 'Ironically', 'taping', 'filled', 'JUST', 'folks', 'parents', 'age', 'maybe', 'just', 'ME', 'LOL', 'Nuncrackers', 'good', 'amusing', 'moments', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Rue', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'added', 'much', 'show', 'better', 'script', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'John', 'Ritter', 'nothing', 'show', 'name', 'face', 'really', 'was', 'big', 'disapointment', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'none', 'are', 'great', 'supporting', 'staff', 'other', ""'nuns"", ""'students"", 'do', 'great', 'job', 'material', 'were', 'given', 'script', 'songs', 'suppose', ""'d"", 'rate', 'could', 'really', '3-1/2', 'stars']",N/A

Apart from being great comedians, these nuns and Father Virgil have great voices. Wish I could say the same for Rue McLachanan. Favorite moments:1. Intro2. ""A time when Robert Anne sneaks out to Clancy's for a beer""3. Ball-breaker4. Secret Santa5. ""We'll fix it in the edit.""6. Santa Ain't Comin' to Our House7. Sister Julia, Child of God8. The Nutcracker (Take Two)9. Jesus Was Born in Brooklyn (very moving)10. In The Convent11. We Three Kings of Orient Are Us (with references to Tom Cruise and Harrod's and a salad shooter)12. Catholic Home Shopping Service13. It's Better to Give Than it Is To ReceiveThese are the specifics but I haven't been too specific about them because I don't want to ruin it for y'all. So what are you all waiting for? Get this DVD but get it around Christmas because it'll look weird if you do it at this time of year. Also, there is a special video insert cameo by John Ritter.

The show is full of original songs by Dan Goggin, the creator of ""Nunsense,"" is directed by David Stern who did the original so he knows how to work this material to its best advantage, and all the songs have the same feel as Goggin's original tunes although perhaps not quite as catchy overall. But with great titles such as ""The Twelve Days Prior to Christmas"" you can expect some funny stuff.Of all the incarnations of ""Nunsense,"" I would place this a solid third behind ""Nunsense,"" and ""Nunsense 2: the Sequel"" and miles above both the Vicki Lawrence ""Nunsense Jamboree"" and the oh-why-did-they-do-that ""Nunsensations!
