1634319,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,B00BF7FGNI,"Greg Ehrbar ""'MouseTracksOnline'""","[15, 18]","It's too easy to take a production like Foodfight! and lob snarky comments at it. Well okay, just one. The characters in this film over-move, like Ed Grimley on that Saturday Night Live sketch when he found out he was going to meet Pat Sajak.But snark is too easy. Figuring out how it happened is almost unfathomable. Let's start with the premise, which is something like those Warner cartoons in which a grocery store came to life after hours and the products sang and danced on the shelves.In this case, the aisles become like multi-national city streets. The lead character (voiced by Charlie Sheen either within a very short one-take recording session or deliberately to sound cool and detached) is a cross between Indiana Jones and McGruff the Crime Dog.All of the primary characters are fictional product icons, while a procession of actual food and grocery item characters, including Mister Clean, Charlie the Tuna and Mrs. Butterworth make cameos. Endless images of real logos and packages make appearances throughout. Perhaps the idea was to have the product placement cover the budget.But the budget and the whole production were apparently a total bust. The film was eventually put up for auction and got a limited release overseas, even though it was finished seven years ago.Much of it doesn't even look finished -- characters and objects shake, overlap and often don't look anchored in their settings. The characters don't seem in scale with each other, nor from scene to scene.The creepy villains look grotesque, but so do some of the ""nice"" characters -- like the evil Mister X and the grocery store manager. Even the copyrighted characters are mere shadows of their former selves as we saw them in commercials. All seem made of PVC and have eyes like marbles.There are moments in which one might glimpse at what could have been. The premise is kind of clever and there are some amusing moments, like an army of ketchup tanks, along with some spectacular graphics of the cityscape. The concrete objects far exceed the ""living ones"" in design and execution.But the script is splattered with lines like ""What the fudge!"" ""You cold-farted itch!"" and famous tag lines that might have worked if used more judiciously. And you can look forward to flatulence and a long-playing belch.I don't like to dump on movie misfires when they're often the product of hard work by good people. And some of these films are fascinating, even likable, despite how the don't, or didn't, work. Often there's more to learn from misses than from hits.The credits for Foodfight! include some of the best talent in the business. I cannot imagine everyone who was brought into this project had any idea what might have been going on behind the scenes, nor how the ""final"" film would turn out.",2,Foodfight! misfires beyond imagination,1368748800,"05 17, 2013",2013,2780,"['too', 'easy', 'take', 'production', 'Foodfight', 'lob', 'snarky', 'comments', 'Well', 'okay', 'just', 'one', 'characters', 'film', 'over-move', 'Ed', 'Grimley', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'sketch', 'when', 'found', 'was', 'going', 'meet', 'Pat', 'Sajak.But', 'snark', 'too', 'easy', 'Figuring', 'out', 'how', 'happened', 'almost', 'unfathomable', 'Let', 'start', 'premise', 'something', 'Warner', 'cartoons', 'grocery', 'store', 'came', 'life', 'hours', 'products', 'sang', 'danced', 'shelves.In', 'case', 'aisles', 'become', 'multi-national', 'city', 'streets', 'lead', 'character', 'voiced', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'either', 'very', 'short', 'one-take', 'recording', 'session', 'deliberately', 'sound', 'cool', 'detached', 'cross', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'McGruff', 'Crime', 'Dog.All', 'primary', 'characters', 'are', 'fictional', 'product', 'icons', 'procession', 'actual', 'food', 'grocery', 'item', 'characters', 'including', 'Mister', 'Clean', 'Charlie', 'Tuna', 'Mrs.', 'Butterworth', 'make', 'cameos', 'Endless', 'images', 'real', 'logos', 'packages', 'make', 'appearances', 'Perhaps', 'idea', 'was', 'have', 'product', 'placement', 'cover', 'budget.But', 'budget', 'whole', 'production', 'were', 'apparently', 'total', 'bust', 'film', 'was', 'eventually', 'put', 'up', 'auction', 'got', 'limited', 'release', 'overseas', 'even', 'was', 'finished', 'seven', 'years', 'ago.Much', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'finished', 'characters', 'objects', 'shake', 'overlap', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'anchored', 'settings', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'scale', 'other', 'scene', 'scene.The', 'creepy', 'villains', 'look', 'grotesque', 'so', 'do', 'nice', 'characters', 'evil', 'Mister', 'X', 'grocery', 'store', 'manager', 'Even', 'copyrighted', 'characters', 'are', 'mere', 'shadows', 'former', 'selves', 'saw', 'commercials', 'seem', 'made', 'PVC', 'have', 'eyes', 'are', 'moments', 'one', 'might', 'glimpse', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'premise', 'kind', 'clever', 'are', 'amusing', 'moments', 'army', 'ketchup', 'tanks', 'spectacular', 'graphics', 'cityscape', 'concrete', 'objects', 'far', 'exceed', 'living', 'ones', 'design', 'execution.But', 'script', 'splattered', 'lines', 'What', 'fudge', 'cold-farted', 'itch', 'famous', 'tag', 'lines', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'used', 'more', 'judiciously', 'can', 'look', 'forward', 'flatulence', 'long-playing', 'belch.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'dump', 'movie', 'misfires', 'when', ""'re"", 'often', 'product', 'hard', 'work', 'good', 'people', 'films', 'are', 'fascinating', 'even', 'likable', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'more', 'learn', 'misses', 'hits.The', 'credits', 'Foodfight', 'include', 'best', 'talent', 'business', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'everyone', 'who', 'was', 'brought', 'project', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'scenes', 'how', 'final', 'film', 'would', 'turn', 'out']",Foodfight!

1634324,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00BF7FGNI,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","When I was browsing through the video store, I noticed FOODFIGHT! It listed Charlie Sheen, Hilary Duff, and Eva Longoria as voices and the cover featured such iconic advertising characters as Charlie Tuna and Mrs. Butterworth. Based upon the description of the movie on the back cover, I thought FOODFIGHT! would be kind of like Toy Story, but with advertising icons. Not only that, but additional voices for the movie were provided by Christopher Loyd, Chris Kattan, Wayne Brady, and Harvey Fierstein. Based upon all of this, you would think that FOODFIGHT! would at least be a half-way decent animated movie. That&#8217;s what I thought, but boy was I ever wrong. FOODFIGHT! turned out to be the worst animated movie I have ever seen.Dex Dogtective&#8217;s (Charlie Sheen) life goes downhill after his girlfriend, Sunshine Goodness (Hilary Duff) disappears right before he proposes to her. Months later, there&#8217;s a new group of items in Marketropolis (the supermarket where the story takes place). These items are Brand X and Brand X&#8217;s most prominent icon is Lady X (Eva Longoria). Classic icons (called &#8220;Ikes&#8221; in the movie) are killed off and expired one-by-one and their products replaces with Brand X merchandise. After his best friend Daredevil Dan (Wayne Brady) disappears, Dex comes out of his slump and starts an investigation that ultimately ends up leading to all out war in the aisles of Marketropolis. Don&#8217;t be fooled, though. This synopsis is actually better than the movie really is.The animation in the film is horrendous. There are parts in the movie where the film is clearly unfinished: you can see the white lines of where scenery in the movie was going to be created, but was never inserted. For instance, there are several times where there is a building, but the building isn&#8217;t completely colored and you can see lines (like in a blueprint) that form the building, but the building is incomplete.For about a third of the movie, the voices don&#8217;t directly match up with what the characters are saying: their lips either move to fast or too slow. This part of the film might make for a good drinking game, but everyone participating would be passed out before the movie was even half over.The dialogue is atrocious and sounds like someone translated the script from a foreign language, but didn&#8217;t bother to adapt what was said into comprehensible English.FOODFIGHT! is supposed to be a children&#8217;s movie, but there&#8217;s actually a lot in the film that I would be uncomfortable having a child watch. For instance, there are several jokes made in the movie that are heavy with sexual overtones and euphemisms. FOODFIGHT! gives Shakespeare a run for his money in number of double entendres used in a story. There is some violence, however, it&#8217;s not real violence. Yet, the film is full of imagery stolen straight out of history from Nazi Germany. There are a couple of scenes that are taken directly from TRIUMPH OF THE WILL.It&#8217;s a wonder FOODFIGHT! ever got made. The movie was actually &#8220;completed&#8221; about ten years before it was released on DVD in the U.S., mostly due to legal troubles. After seeing it, one almost wonders why anyone would bother over a movie so bad. There isn&#8217;t anything in FOODFIGHT! worth fighting about.",1,The Worst Animated Movie of All Time,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,3328,"['When', 'was', 'browsing', 'video', 'store', 'noticed', 'FOODFIGHT', 'listed', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'voices', 'cover', 'featured', 'such', 'iconic', 'advertising', 'characters', 'Charlie', 'Tuna', 'Mrs.', 'Butterworth', 'Based', 'description', 'movie', 'back', 'cover', 'thought', 'FOODFIGHT', 'would', 'be', 'kind', 'like', 'Toy', 'Story', 'advertising', 'icons', 'Not', 'only', 'additional', 'voices', 'movie', 'were', 'provided', 'Christopher', 'Loyd', 'Chris', 'Kattan', 'Wayne', 'Brady', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'Based', 'would', 'think', 'FOODFIGHT', 'would', 'least', 'be', 'half-way', 'decent', 'animated', 'movie', '8217', 's', 'what', 'thought', 'boy', 'was', 'ever', 'wrong', 'FOODFIGHT', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'worst', 'animated', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.Dex', 'Dogtective', '8217', 's', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'life', 'downhill', 'girlfriend', 'Sunshine', 'Goodness', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'right', 'Months', 'later', '8217', 's', 'new', 'group', 'items', 'Marketropolis', 'supermarket', 'where', 'story', 'place', 'items', 'are', 'Brand', 'X', 'Brand', 'X', '8217', 'most', 'prominent', 'icon', 'Lady', 'X', 'Eva', 'Longoria', 'Classic', 'icons', 'called', '8220', 'Ikes', '8221', 'movie', 'are', 'killed', 'off', 'expired', 'one-by-one', 'products', 'replaces', 'Brand', 'X', 'merchandise', 'best', 'friend', 'Daredevil', 'Dan', 'Wayne', 'Brady', 'Dex', 'slump', 'investigation', 'ultimately', 'up', 'leading', 'out', 'war', 'aisles', 'Marketropolis', 'Don', '8217', 'be', 'fooled', 'though', 'synopsis', 'actually', 'better', 'movie', 'really', 'is.The', 'animation', 'film', 'horrendous', 'are', 'parts', 'movie', 'where', 'film', 'clearly', 'unfinished', 'can', 'see', 'white', 'lines', 'where', 'scenery', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'created', 'was', 'never', 'inserted', 'instance', 'are', 'several', 'times', 'where', 'building', 'building', 'isn', '8217', 'completely', 'colored', 'can', 'see', 'lines', 'blueprint', 'form', 'building', 'building', 'incomplete.For', 'third', 'movie', 'voices', 'don', '8217', 'directly', 'match', 'up', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'saying', 'lips', 'move', 'fast', 'too', 'slow', 'part', 'film', 'might', 'make', 'good', 'drinking', 'game', 'everyone', 'participating', 'would', 'be', 'passed', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'even', 'over.The', 'dialogue', 'atrocious', 'someone', 'translated', 'script', 'foreign', 'language', 'didn', '8217', 'bother', 'adapt', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'comprehensible', 'English.FOODFIGHT', 'supposed', 'be', 'children', '8217', 's', 'movie', 'there', '8217', 's', 'actually', 'lot', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'having', 'child', 'watch', 'instance', 'are', 'several', 'jokes', 'made', 'movie', 'are', 'heavy', 'sexual', 'overtones', 'euphemisms', 'FOODFIGHT', 'Shakespeare', 'run', 'money', 'number', 'double', 'entendres', 'used', 'story', 'violence', 'however', '8217', 'not', 'real', 'violence', 'film', 'full', 'imagery', 'stolen', 'straight', 'history', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'are', 'taken', 'directly', 'TRIUMPH', 'THE', 'WILL.It', '8217', 's', 'wonder', 'FOODFIGHT', 'ever', 'got', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', '8220', 'completed', '8221', 'ten', 'years', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'U.S.', 'mostly', 'due', 'legal', 'troubles', 'seeing', 'one', 'almost', 'wonders', 'why', 'anyone', 'would', 'bother', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'isn', '8217', 'anything', 'FOODFIGHT', 'worth', 'fighting', 'about']",Foodfight!
