Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 2]","I did miss the group gatherings that were throughout the first film, because it really allowed us to see where some of the jokes originated and how these friends interact, and honestly, I think it hurt this film.  The friendships were there, it was obvious, but it just didn't come through the television as predominately as the first.  Also, they were all trying new material this outing.  You could tell, because the comfort level was a bit off.  It was as if they were wondering to themselves if the joke would work, or if people were applauding because of who they were not what they were saying.  Maybe this second film was rushed due to the overwhelming popularity of the original, but it wasn't the same.One keen observation that can be made about this second film was the audience seemed to be whiter collar than redneck.  Half the fun of the original was seeing the audience reacting and laughing at the people that just looked like these comedians were taking a moment of their life and speaking it on stage.  While that may seem mean and morbid, I found that it worked well with the comedians.  A bit of irony if you don't mind, here we have comedians making fun of the people that are laughing at them.  What a strange, continuously circling world we live in.  In this film, the audience seemed more glamorized and you could tell that they were laughing at the people, not so much the jokes.  This can been seen because Foxworthy didn't do any of his patented ""redneck"" jokes, it was as if he modified the joke into the ""married/gay"" routine just for this audience ... as well as what I was saying about new material.Overall, I thought that this was a decent outing, just not quite containing the same insanity as the first.  I especially did not enjoy the fact that it ended in a very similar fashion as the first.  I just thought that originality and creativity were forgotten about just to capitalize yet again on the popularity of the original.  I wouldn't mind seeing these guys in concert live, but it may make me hesitate for a moment to consider renting another one of their films.  I, sigh, cannot wait to see more of Larry the Cable Guy and with him doing a voice in the next Pixar film Cars, I know that he is going to be the breakout star of the entire endeavor.  If you liked the first film, I don't think it would be unwise to see this film, just be prepared for not as much hilarity as the first provided.Grade: *** out of *****",3,I told you to wait in the Truck!,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,2455,"['did', 'miss', 'group', 'gatherings', 'were', 'first', 'film', 'really', 'allowed', 'see', 'where', 'jokes', 'originated', 'how', 'friends', 'interact', 'honestly', 'think', 'film', 'friendships', 'were', 'there', 'was', 'obvious', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'television', 'as', 'predominately', 'first', 'Also', 'were', 'trying', 'new', 'material', 'outing', 'could', 'tell', 'comfort', 'level', 'was', 'bit', 'off', 'was', 'were', 'wondering', 'joke', 'would', 'work', 'people', 'were', 'applauding', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'Maybe', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'rushed', 'due', 'overwhelming', 'popularity', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'same.One', 'keen', 'observation', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'second', 'film', 'was', 'audience', 'seemed', 'be', 'whiter', 'collar', 'redneck', 'fun', 'original', 'was', 'seeing', 'audience', 'reacting', 'laughing', 'people', 'just', 'looked', 'comedians', 'were', 'taking', 'moment', 'life', 'speaking', 'stage', 'may', 'seem', 'mean', 'morbid', 'found', 'worked', 'well', 'comedians', 'bit', 'irony', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'here', 'have', 'comedians', 'making', 'fun', 'people', 'are', 'laughing', 'What', 'strange', 'continuously', 'circling', 'world', 'live', 'film', 'audience', 'seemed', 'more', 'glamorized', 'could', 'tell', 'were', 'laughing', 'people', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'jokes', 'can', 'been', 'seen', 'Foxworthy', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'patented', 'redneck', 'jokes', 'was', 'modified', 'joke', 'married/gay', 'routine', 'just', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'saying', 'new', 'material.Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'outing', 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'containing', 'same', 'insanity', 'first', 'especially', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'ended', 'very', 'similar', 'fashion', 'first', 'just', 'thought', 'originality', 'creativity', 'were', 'forgotten', 'about', 'just', 'capitalize', 'yet', 'again', 'popularity', 'original', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'guys', 'concert', 'live', 'may', 'make', 'hesitate', 'moment', 'consider', 'renting', 'one', 'films', 'sigh', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'more', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'doing', 'voice', 'next', 'Pixar', 'film', 'Cars', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'breakout', 'star', 'entire', 'endeavor', 'liked', 'first', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'unwise', 'see', 'film', 'just', 'be', 'prepared', 'not', 'much', 'hilarity', 'first', 'provided.Grade', '***', '*****']",N/A

Billing""","[4, 5]","After watching, and thoroughly enjoying, the first Blue Collar Comedy Tour, I was expecting big things from their second DVD. Like many sequels, The Blue Collar Comdey Tour Rides Again wasn't nearly as good as the first. In fact my biggest impression was that it was thrown together in order to get it out in time for Holiday Shoppers.For starters, TBCCTRA is obviously lacking the entertaining scenes, between the stand up bits, which showcased the boys hanging out, going to the mall, etc. In my honest opinion, these scenes, from the original, were every bit as funny as the stand up performances themselves. There is only one such scene at the beginning of TBCCTRA and that is it. Another thing,noticably absent from this DVD, is the extra features and featurettes. There are none.In addition, the stand up routines themselves, except for Larry The Cable Guy's performance, just aren't as funny. Bill Engvall, known for his witty ""There's your sign,"" bits only has three in his performance and they aren't that funny. Ron White is entertaining but most of his stand up material is not anything new. The majority comes from his ""They Call Me Tater Salad"" DVD. Jeff Foxworthy was pretty funny but I'll echo, what another reviewer stated, about him not seeming to want to be there. His trademark ""You Might Be A Redneck"" bits were noticably absent from his routine. Finally, the finale, which features all four comedians, was brief and only mildly humorous.I'd recommend skipping this one or just renting it.

There were some funny bits, but I found the show in general a bit more crude and in some cases, a bit mean.For instance, I was wondering during Bill Engvall's routine if there is trouble in his paradise. He was considerably more sarcastic and almost nasty at times when speaking of his wife. He wasn't like that in the first one.I noticed Jeff Foxworthy had a few zingers for his wife also. Nothing major in his case, still...  He was funny, of course, as was Bill. I didn't think the changes were for the better, though.Larry had some major misses and some hits. I think he should review tapes of his performances to get a better idea of what works and what doesn't. Very crude occasionally, but still comes across as basically a nice guy. What also keeps coming across is that under that dumb country boy pose, is a man who is probably a college graduate with a masters in Economics or something. The boy definately is not what he seems on surface.Ron White was disappointing. The main reason I got saw this second one was how hysterical he was in the first. I even bought his DRUNK IN PUBLIC cd. A lot of his material from this DVD was from that cd, with some occasional additions. He was still funny but needs to work on his chronological order when it comes to wives. The new one must not care that he still refers to the ex as his wife. On the surface he appears to be doing well: better clothes, less drinking, cigars instead of cigarettes. Maybe the new wife is having some influence after all. I wish he'd had all new material (my husband said he didn't need new material cuz what he had was still very funny.  You decide.)  but he was still a hoot.  (NOTE: I SAW WHITE IN CONCERT IN 2007 AND HE WAS WONDERFUL! IF YOU GET THE CHANCE, BY ALL MEANS, GO!)If you can only buy one, get the first one.

856644,A8TM0MI3D9T29,B00062IDO2,Brett Corkins,"[2, 2]","This is everything I expected and more. Every comedian on here is histerical with their own distinct brand of comedy. The show starts off with Bill Engvall, my personal favorite. With just one joke he topped his entire set in the first Blue Collar film. That joke was the Dorkfish bit, I had tears in my eyes afterwards. His entire set is equally, if not funnier, than in his own DVDs. Ron White follows with his stand out humor. His humor consists more of sarcasm than outright jokes. His set is over the top and he talks about everything from dead dogs to married life. While there isn't a joke that stands out to me such as Bill's Dorkfish bit, his time was well spent. Everything that comes out of his mouth will make you at least chuckle. The infamous Jeff Foxworthy comes after Ron. He doesn't seem to be up to par with the other comedians or with his older material but it is undeniably funny. His bit about real-life hunting as opposed to TV hunting more than makes up for his less than stellar set. The ever popular Larry The Cable Guy rounds out the solo sets. Larry's set effortlessly suprasses anything he has previously done. He was probably my second favorite of the night. Every joke he told killed and was absolutely hilarious. It was also funny to see him apologizing for what he said after a few jokes. He definitely had a stand out night that night. The most disappointing thing about this DVD is the final part where all the guys get back on stage together and tell some jokes. This part is the only part in the film that fell drastically short of living up to it's predecessor. The first film's ""reunion"" part was arguably the best part, however with this it's the only part I wouldn't mind not watching. One thing missing was Jeff's always funny You Might Be A Redneck jokes. Bill did fit his Here's Your Sign jokes in so that makes up for it in a small portion. Overall this is definitely worthy of the Blue Collar logo.

This follow-up to the overwhelmingly successful 2003 Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie features the hilarious return of popular comics Ron White, Bill Engvall, Jeff Foxworthy, and Larry The Cable Guy. If this show doesn't make you laugh, then you've got serious problems.Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again kicks off with the tour bus rolling down a Colorado highway. The four comedy superstars decide to draw numbers from a hat to decide who will go first, second, third, and fourth... Larry The Cable Guy draws seven-and-a-half - but that's the hat size tag!You'll have to watch this movie for yourself to see in which order the comics perform. But I'll tell you right now that it doesn't really matter. With Larry's ""Git-R-Done"" tagline and ""Lord, I apologize"" warnings, Ron White's liquor induced truth-telling, Bill Engvall's dissection of relationships, and Jeff Foxworthy's classic comedy - you won't find a dull moment. I'd love to provide you with an anecdote (but if I knew the difference between an anecdote and antidote, then my childhood friend would still be alive). So instead, I'll avoid examples and leave the individual jokes for your surprise enjoyment...However, I will fill you in on the great ending. One of the more hilarious segments of the show is where the four comics gather on stage following their individual performances. In the original Blue Collar Comedy Tour, the men told personal stories. In Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again, Larry The Cable Guy plays (or at least attempts to play) a guitar while each of the men finishes the quotation ""I believe..."" in a song by the same name. It's a funny exchange with some great one-liners, such as ""I believe... that if you can't say something nice, then you must be talking about Hillary Clinton"" (Jeff Foxworthy) and ""I believe... if life gives you lemons, you should make lemonade. Then go find someone who life gave vodka to and have a big-ass party!"" (Ron White)Just as good as the original (an extremely rare occurrence in movie sequels), Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again is two hours of non-stop laughs, and if you have to ask why, then ""here's your sign""!

I was laughing so hard I had to rewind the DVD because I kept missing the next joke.Each comedian was in their usual ""roles"" with Bill Engvall being kind of the everyman, Ron White the alcoholic, cigar puffing derelict, Foxworthy - mostly joking about families and married life, and Larry the Cable guy, the ultimate caricature of a real dumb Southern redneck.The only disappointing part of the show was that I did not find the encore where the four comedians sit down together to tell jokes very funny.  The encore in the previous DVD (The Blue Collar Comedy Tour) was the best part of the entire show.  Here it's just kind of flat.Nevertheless, the stand-up comedy acts were great and had me laughing throughout.",5,Laugh Out Loud Funny,1111017600,"03 17, 2005",2005,1151,"['Blue', 'Collar', 'Comedy', 'Tour', 'Rides', 'again', 'comedians', 'Ron', 'White', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'Jeff', 'Foxworthy', 'are', 'again', 'doing', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'shtick', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'four', 'have', 'new', 'material', 'whole', 'new', 'set', 'jokes', 'fun', 'previous', 'show.All', 'four', 'comedians', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'was', 'top', 'funny', 'exaggerated', 'southern', 'drawl', 'dumb', 'jokes', 'was', 'laughing', 'so', 'hard', 'had', 'rewind', 'DVD', 'kept', 'missing', 'next', 'joke.Each', 'comedian', 'was', 'usual', 'roles', 'Bill', 'Engvall', 'being', 'kind', 'everyman', 'Ron', 'White', 'alcoholic', 'cigar', 'puffing', 'derelict', 'Foxworthy', 'mostly', 'joking', 'families', 'married', 'life', 'Larry', 'Cable', 'guy', 'ultimate', 'caricature', 'real', 'dumb', 'Southern', 'redneck.The', 'only', 'disappointing', 'part', 'show', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'encore', 'where', 'four', 'comedians', 'sit', 'down', 'together', 'tell', 'jokes', 'very', 'funny', 'encore', 'previous', 'DVD', 'Blue', 'Collar', 'Comedy', 'Tour', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'entire', 'show', 'Here', 'just', 'kind', 'flat.Nevertheless', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'acts', 'were', 'great', 'had', 'laughing']",N/A

At one point, Bill Engvall begins to crack himself up while improvising, which was funny.Bill Engvall's - (Here's your sign!) Ironic wit is easy to enjoy and very funny. Among his bits are: DorkFish, Deerhunting with your Wife, Men are Simple Creatures, Pillow TalkRon White - (sober or soused?) Ron is dark, sarcastic, and mean. Among his funny bits are: Waiting for the In-Laws to die, Garth Brooks and Camping, and Trolling for a new father-in-law in the retirement home.Jeff Foxworthy - I find Jeff the funniest of the bunch with a fresh-faced, wide-eyed, good-natured view of the absurd. His material was all new and fresh. His act included some hilarious pieces: Hoo-Hoos are Poisonous, Hunting at Home, Oreo GenerationLarry-The-Cable Guy - Git R Done! I don't care who you are, this is funny. Rude, crude, and socially unacceptable, Larry is the most juvenile of the group. His stories mostly involve his inbred, wild family: his sister, aunt, Grandma, and all the other zanies from double-wide heaven provide ample anecdotes with one-liners cascading one after another.A lot of fun.

This is the sequel to ""The Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie"", and like most sequels, at least in my opinion, does not equal the original.  Don't get me wrong, it's funny and worth buying, it just doesn't have the same gut busting affect that the first one does.This DVD features the same four comedians as the first one, Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, Larry the Cable Guy and Ron White.  Contrary to the first one, I found Ron White and Larry the Cable Guy to be the funniest of the four this time around.  It's most likely because I'd heard most of Foxworthy's routine on his newest album so I pretty much knew how his jokes went and Engvall's just didn't seem to have a certain bite to them or something I don't know.I also wish they would have done some ""You Might Be a Redneck If"" routines and told stories at the end when they all come out together like last time instead of doing the ""I Believe"" song.

As I've said in the review for the first movie, some of the things (in my opinion) that make these guys funny is the fact that they look like they're having fun and they make a lot of jokes about stuff that happens. Larry the Cable Guy is kind of your stereotypical stupid southerner, but he's great (ex.""I was living with this girl for about three months till she found out I was there).
