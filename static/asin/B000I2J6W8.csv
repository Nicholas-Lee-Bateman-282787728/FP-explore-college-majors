There are just a lot of episodes that I consider classics in this season. This is the season when Tim gets his Ph.D that makes both Jill and Wilson jealous and this is also the season that has the famous episode about how Randy may have cancer. Whether it is funny or very serious, some of the best episodes are in this season. One of my favorite episodes is ""The Look"". You can't beat the reaction given by Al and Benny when they see it for the first time. You gotta see it for yourself, I couldn't stop laughing! This season also has the first appearance of Tim's mom.

It has slapstick humor for dad, soft and tender moments for mom, and kids antics for my children. What I like about this program is that the writing is sincere where you can relate to the characters. There is not one episode where my side does not hurt from laughter even after watching them over and over.Each episode runs about 22 minutes in length. And each one leaves you to wonder how does this guy still have a tool show? It must be Al. What I like about this season is the addition of Tim's brother's family in some of the episodes.
