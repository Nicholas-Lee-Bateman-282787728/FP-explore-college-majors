1182237,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B001DN0UPI,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","I must say. Suzuka is one mean and uppity gal. I found it really difficult to sympathize with the main character's infatuation with her. I understand that sometimes one cannot help but love another person, despite circumstance. But she is genuinely mean to him. We see later that there was something in her past that helped to spark this kind of attitude, and then when the viewer is ready to forgive her, she gets even worse! So I had a hard time stomaching this show because I just couldn't stand her.But being a fan of track and field, I did enjoy the periphery story. I did also like most of the characters in the series as well. The animation is pretty good and the voice acting (in the Japanese) is solid. The music confused me because I kept thinking it was from another series and they were re-using it. Maybe it was just similar to something else like Clannad.But when Akitsuki says anything nice, Suzuka basically turns on him and lashes out in mean ways. Such as when his family puts her up for the night, and he offers to show her around, she gripes at him and tells him to leave her alone. Later she asks to stay another night so she can see the fireflies. Of course, this was not a nice gesture, but a way of breaking apart two other happy people. Jeez. But she gets so upset and standoffish when he becomes interested in someone else after overhearing her say she dislikes him. I mean, can you blame the poor guy?All in all a decent show, but I really cringe at how rotten Suzuka is to Akitsuki and how often he just seems to take it or how he continues to try and befriend her. I kept waiting for someone to slap her. But I finished the series because I was invested in watching already, and the track scenes were nice.  Though in the end, the actual story arc involving Akitsuki was left unfinished.I understand Suzuka's reasons for being the way she is, as it is revealed in her back story.  But it's really tough to watch at times.  So don't hate me for the 'okay' review.  I know that love is blind and all, and the viewer is really behind Akitsuki and rooting for him because of his stubborn good nature.  I give the first half of the show 2 stars and the second half 4 stars.  It does improve about halfway through, right about the time where Akitsuki offers that special someone a birthday present.  From then on the series improves drastically.Overall I wouldn't have missed anything by not watching this. If you like track an field, then it's a good watch. But for teen romance, look at other series: Clannad (one of the best ever), Haruhi Suzuyama, High School Rumble, etc...",3,At least it ends well...,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,2601,"['must', 'say', 'Suzuka', 'one', 'mean', 'uppity', 'gal', 'found', 'really', 'difficult', 'sympathize', 'main', 'character', 'infatuation', 'understand', 'sometimes', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'love', 'person', 'circumstance', 'genuinely', 'mean', 'see', 'later', 'was', 'something', 'past', 'helped', 'spark', 'kind', 'attitude', 'then', 'when', 'viewer', 'ready', 'forgive', 'even', 'worse', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'stomaching', 'show', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'her.But', 'being', 'fan', 'track', 'field', 'did', 'enjoy', 'periphery', 'story', 'did', 'also', 'most', 'characters', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'animation', 'pretty', 'good', 'voice', 'acting', 'Japanese', 'solid', 'music', 'confused', 'kept', 'thinking', 'was', 'series', 'were', 're-using', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'similar', 'something', 'else', 'Clannad.But', 'when', 'Akitsuki', 'anything', 'nice', 'Suzuka', 'basically', 'out', 'mean', 'ways', 'Such', 'when', 'family', 'up', 'night', 'show', 'around', 'leave', 'alone', 'Later', 'stay', 'night', 'can', 'see', 'fireflies', 'course', 'was', 'not', 'nice', 'gesture', 'way', 'breaking', 'apart', 'two', 'other', 'happy', 'people', 'Jeez', 'so', 'upset', 'standoffish', 'when', 'becomes', 'interested', 'someone', 'else', 'overhearing', 'say', 'mean', 'can', 'blame', 'poor', 'guy', 'decent', 'show', 'really', 'cringe', 'how', 'rotten', 'Suzuka', 'Akitsuki', 'how', 'often', 'just', 'take', 'how', 'try', 'befriend', 'kept', 'waiting', 'someone', 'slap', 'finished', 'series', 'was', 'invested', 'watching', 'already', 'track', 'scenes', 'were', 'nice', 'end', 'actual', 'story', 'arc', 'involving', 'Akitsuki', 'was', 'left', 'unfinished.I', 'understand', 'Suzuka', 'reasons', 'being', 'way', 'revealed', 'back', 'story', 'really', 'tough', 'watch', 'times', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', ""'okay"", 'review', 'know', 'love', 'blind', 'viewer', 'really', 'behind', 'Akitsuki', 'rooting', 'stubborn', 'good', 'nature', 'give', 'first', 'half', 'show', '2', 'stars', 'second', 'half', '4', 'stars', 'improve', 'halfway', 'right', 'time', 'where', 'Akitsuki', 'special', 'someone', 'birthday', 'present', 'then', 'series', 'drastically.Overall', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'missed', 'anything', 'not', 'watching', 'like', 'track', 'field', 'then', 'good', 'watch', 'teen', 'romance', 'look', 'other', 'series', 'Clannad', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'Haruhi', 'Suzuyama', 'High', 'School', 'Rumble', 'etc']",Suzuka

EX: Love Hina that main character is so ignorant and dorky. There is usually a lot of poor comedy as well. This series is different, sure the main character is a dork, but not too much to where I was turned off.The story starts out like this. Yamato(the main character) goes to tokyo to attend high school and sees this beautiful girl(Suzuka other main character) on a track field while walking to his new apartment. He instantly falls in love with her. On his way home he trys to figure out ways to introduce himself to her and when he makes it to his new home he finds out she lives next door to him. He goes through many challenges to win over Suzuka's heart, but she is just so stubborn. Then Yamato finally finds out what is the matter with Suzuka.It is a wonderful story that any one that has been to high school and has liked someone can relate to. This series reminded me of how you are so close to the things you want to have, but yet you can not reach them. If you like drama/comedy series then you will enjoy this one. It only cost me about $15 so it was not much, but it was worth every penny. This is a series that ages 10 and up can watch.

1182248,AIO0Y6M8CLEKF,B001DN0UPI,MarkoSion,"[8, 8]","I remember buying the first DVD of this series at a DVD sale at a local video score.  I thought I give it a try.  Having not read the manga for Suzuka, my opinion might be a little short-sighted since I heard more rave reviews for the comic strips due its detailed development of the characters and plot.  Basically, I bought series this fresh with no background of the story.Overall, its a mixed bag:  its plot is enjoyable overall yet you have to be patient for the story to unfold. The Suzuka series here suffers from some pacing issues and slow character development.  The story later does give a significant backdrop to Suzuka's personality so we begin to empathize with her more.  Yet the beginning starts off rough, with the two main characters not hitting it off and Asahina (Suzuka) seeming so cold that the foundation of their storyline starts awkward.  Also, the beginning throws a huge smokescreen with the whole bathhouse comedic sub-plot.  It made no sense and makes viewers confused if this is a lovestory or a fan-service ATM machine.  Also, Asahina, I felt, was a flat character who spews venom towards everyone and lacks any depth, even with her haunted past.  By the time her story is known, I felt it was too late to save her character, she just lacks depth and just runs her mouth.  Akitsuki, meanwhile, is portrayed as an annoying loser who just pesters everyone.  His internal gripes and love-moments with Suzuka make him seem obsessive rather a lovable/loser hero.  The whole point of these ""love-chase"" kind of series is to believe that the hero has qualities that will ultimately shine.  Akitsuki, throughout the anime, doesn't really have that.  He just yells and runs back to her over, and over again.  We are supposed to believe in him, but in the end we exasperate in desperation at his fallacies and bumpkiss exploits to try to win his crush.The only major credit I give to the series are the supporting characters.  I believe they hold it together where the two main characters lack real substance.  Honoka is cute and loveable; you root for her and feel her pain during her roller-coaster feeling battle and towards the end SHE is the lynchpin who makes the story finish well.  Miki Hashiba is charming yet a good supporter of both Asahina and Akitsuki.  Hattori is as a fool (when it comes to his philosophy on girls) as wise in helping Akitsuki in his troubles.  The whole sub-plot of track and field develops well, which I believe in itself is a minor character:  the idea of how far you push yourself to reach your goal/love, the pain, the determination, the grit to finish well.  The perfection-drive to fix your wrongs in your technique.  It fits well and nicely, as Akitsuki realizes the joy of running changes his perspective on his love for Asahina.Overall, would I recommend this one?  If you want a more serious plot line, I think this one will do you well.  If you are looking for something more light-hearted, Suzuka is not for you.  I thought this was not a bad anime; there were some really great moments of laughter and ""ahhhh,"" but the character development needs work, especially the two main characters.

The animation is pretty cheap, and theres not that many good moments in the show.  I myself bought it on a whim because I though I would find the Track & Field elements interesting, and I did.  However just as you get into those elements, the romance/SOL kicks back in.  which I would'nt mind if it was actually well done, however the way the characters & romance are portrayed in this Anime is fairly weak.  And again, the series feels Bipolar at times, it wants to be a SOL/Romance & a Sports anime, and kind of fails at both.  Overall its decent enough for what it is I guess, I'd give it a solid C.  However, I would stick to the Manga for this particular series, which I have heard many say is far better, and has nicer art, lol.",1,Cliches Galore.,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,819,"['bought', 'Suzaka', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'have', 'say', 'pretty', 'weak', 'show', 'animation', 'pretty', 'cheap', 'not', 'many', 'good', 'moments', 'show', 'bought', 'whim', 'would', 'find', 'Track', 'Field', 'interesting', 'did', 'However', 'just', 'get', 'elements', 'romance/SOL', 'back', ""would'nt"", 'mind', 'was', 'actually', 'well', 'done', 'however', 'way', 'characters', 'romance', 'are', 'portrayed', 'Anime', 'fairly', 'weak', 'again', 'series', 'Bipolar', 'times', 'be', 'SOL/Romance', 'Sports', 'anime', 'kind', 'fails', 'decent', 'enough', 'what', 'guess', ""'d"", 'give', 'solid', 'C.', 'However', 'would', 'stick', 'Manga', 'particular', 'series', 'have', 'heard', 'many', 'say', 'far', 'better', 'nicer', 'art', 'lol']",Suzuka

Sure, it has those things, but there is a lot more. It tells the story of a boy caught up with the fantasy of being with the one girl in school everyone dreams of being with, but never says it out loud. The story comes together a little slow, but you eventually get into it and even begin to cheer for the main character as he strives not only to win over Suzuka, but also accomplish his own track and field goals. There are a few rather funny moments in the series so it doesn't become overly serious except when it needs to be. When it all ends, you expect it, but it's still just as satisfying.

The characters seem to mature and steadily progress to the finishing line in this story. The colors and music helped with the telling of the main story and the characters own story to bring the two hearts together to be one whole heart. We all have to go through daily trials that make us question whether or not the goal you set that day is really attainable fot the long run. But sometimes we are so focused on the goal that we fail to realize how other people we interact with daily may have a profound influence in our lives and helping us to realize what is really important to us in reaching this goal.
