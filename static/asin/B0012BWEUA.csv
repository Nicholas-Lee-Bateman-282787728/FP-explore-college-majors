1136262,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B0012BWEUA,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[5, 6]","What I found the most interesting in this film was the careful documentation of the varied positions Hillary Clinton has taken on so many issues. These are not just quotations, mind you; they're news clips of Hillary at public appearances, where she contradicts herself over and over again, on any number of questions and issues.Many concern Hillary's involvement in the Whitewater real estate scandal, illicit commodities trading, cover-ups of Bill's infidelities, and the like.Then there's the matter of why, exactly, in February 1999 Bill Clinton did not order U.S. forces to bomb bombing a falcon training camp in the Afghan desert where Osama bin Laden was hunting with Dubai sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. And why ABC television, a Disney company subsidiary, suddenly killed its docudrama mini series, ""The Path to 9/11,"" virtually on the eve of its airing.And portions of the film concern unresolved questions about TWA flight 800, which according to witnesses, was shot down in the Atlantic Ocean on July 17, 1996 12 minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy airport en route to Italy.I don't give much credence to theories proposed as to who might have perpetrated such an act.Nevertheless, the eyewitness testimonies, together with those from employees of TWA and former national security officials, do raise serious questions on why the the Federal Bureau of Investigation did not fully investigate this matter, but rather effectively silenced witnesses. Consequently. the National Transportation Safety Board announced on November 17 1997 that there had been no evidence of criminality.In fact, there appears to have been a great deal of evidence, certainly of foul play. And dozens of these credible scraps of data are included in the film, along with film and testimony concerning the corroborating evidence. At the very least, many plausible questions remain.What interested me the most, however, was Bill Clinton's pardon of 16 convicted FALN terrorists, whose organization claimed responsibility for bombing the Fraunces Tavern in New York on January 24, 1975. The incident killed four innocent civilians and seriously wounded 60 others. Some of the FALN members were serving 50 year sentences that were commuted---evidently because Hillary Clinton heavily lobbied Bill to do so, at the request of Hispanic leaders in New York.In 1999, when those pardons were granted, Hillary Clinton was merely ""exploring"" the possibility of moving to New York State and running for Senator.My biggest problem with this film is the opening, which goes on for a good 10 to 12 minutes, during which many pundits and former political advisers make pithy comments on Hillary's inappropriateness for office. But during that span, none of the speakers are identified, and no facts are given, only opinion.After that, the film is composed entirely of interviews, identified film clips----and tons of facts.Contrary to the opinion of some reviewers, the issues and questions in raised in this film are by and large substantiated with facts, dates, newspaper clips and news reels. It would be a mistake to dismiss it simply because of the film's etiology.",4,Interesting,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,3160,"['What', 'found', 'most', 'interesting', 'film', 'was', 'careful', 'documentation', 'varied', 'positions', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'taken', 'so', 'many', 'issues', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'quotations', 'mind', ""'re"", 'news', 'clips', 'Hillary', 'public', 'appearances', 'where', 'over', 'again', 'number', 'questions', 'issues.Many', 'concern', 'Hillary', 'involvement', 'Whitewater', 'real', 'estate', 'scandal', 'illicit', 'commodities', 'trading', 'cover-ups', 'Bill', 'infidelities', 'like.Then', 'matter', 'why', 'exactly', 'February', '1999', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'did', 'not', 'order', 'U.S.', 'forces', 'bomb', 'bombing', 'falcon', 'training', 'camp', 'Afghan', 'desert', 'where', 'Osama', 'bin', 'Laden', 'was', 'hunting', 'Dubai', 'sheikh', 'Mohammed', 'bin', 'Rashid', 'Al', 'Maktoum', 'why', 'ABC', 'television', 'Disney', 'company', 'subsidiary', 'suddenly', 'killed', 'docudrama', 'mini', 'series', 'Path', '9/11', 'virtually', 'eve', 'airing.And', 'portions', 'film', 'concern', 'unresolved', 'questions', 'TWA', 'flight', '800', 'according', 'witnesses', 'was', 'shot', 'down', 'Atlantic', 'Ocean', 'July', '17', '1996', '12', 'minutes', 'taking', 'off', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'airport', 'en', 'route', 'Italy.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'credence', 'theories', 'proposed', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'perpetrated', 'act.Nevertheless', 'eyewitness', 'testimonies', 'together', 'employees', 'TWA', 'former', 'national', 'security', 'officials', 'do', 'raise', 'serious', 'questions', 'why', 'Federal', 'Bureau', 'Investigation', 'did', 'not', 'fully', 'investigate', 'matter', 'rather', 'effectively', 'silenced', 'witnesses', 'Consequently', 'National', 'Transportation', 'Safety', 'Board', 'announced', 'November', '17', '1997', 'had', 'been', 'evidence', 'criminality.In', 'fact', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'deal', 'evidence', 'certainly', 'foul', 'play', 'dozens', 'credible', 'scraps', 'data', 'are', 'included', 'film', 'film', 'testimony', 'concerning', 'corroborating', 'evidence', 'very', 'least', 'many', 'plausible', 'questions', 'interested', 'most', 'however', 'was', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'pardon', '16', 'convicted', 'FALN', 'terrorists', 'organization', 'claimed', 'responsibility', 'bombing', 'Fraunces', 'Tavern', 'New', 'York', 'January', '24', '1975', 'incident', 'killed', 'four', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'seriously', 'wounded', '60', 'others', 'FALN', 'members', 'were', 'serving', '50', 'year', 'sentences', 'were', 'commuted', '-evidently', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'heavily', 'lobbied', 'Bill', 'do', 'so', 'request', 'Hispanic', 'leaders', 'New', 'York.In', '1999', 'when', 'pardons', 'were', 'granted', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'was', 'merely', 'exploring', 'possibility', 'moving', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'running', 'Senator.My', 'biggest', 'problem', 'film', 'opening', 'good', '10', '12', 'minutes', 'many', 'pundits', 'former', 'political', 'advisers', 'make', 'pithy', 'comments', 'Hillary', 'inappropriateness', 'office', 'span', 'none', 'speakers', 'are', 'identified', 'facts', 'are', 'given', 'only', 'opinion.After', 'film', 'composed', 'entirely', 'interviews', 'identified', 'film', 'clips', 'tons', 'facts.Contrary', 'opinion', 'reviewers', 'issues', 'questions', 'raised', 'film', 'are', 'large', 'substantiated', 'facts', 'dates', 'newspaper', 'clips', 'news', 'reels', 'would', 'be', 'mistake', 'dismiss', 'simply', 'film', 'etiology']",Hillary The Movie

1136266,AI54XO5Z755FH,B0012BWEUA,"Drake-by-the-Lake ""movie critic""","[10, 43]","I watched over half the show so far, and basically it's an amateurproduction. A video clip repeated throughout the film shows yellowedold newspaper clippings with headlines like ""Lies"" and ""Apologizes""and stuff like that, in most cases without identifying the newspapers.They keep repeating ominous words in ominous tones, like ""lies,""""deception,"" etc. over and over again, to the point of being annoying.Anytime Hillary's voice is replayed, they distort the sound wave tomake it seem harsh and irritating. I think the producerseither are stupid themselves, or think the viewing audience is stupid.In the case of old school conservatives, like McCain, they aremistaken. McCain conservatives have a brain, and won't be impressed bythis film.Also, somebody apparently thinks Ann Coulter has more charisma than ahyena. Well, she doesn't. She reminds me of the wife of the commandantat Buchenwald, who ordered a lampshade fashioned out of human flesh.They repeatedly interview the former associate editor of theWashington Times, a paranoid right-wing rag in the D.C. area. I'veread it before and was not impressed with the newspaper. If these arethe Clinton's critics, Bill and Hillary have an easy road ahead ofthem.The only good part to the show so far was Travelgate. I didn't likehow Bobby Zale [sp?] was treated, but it remains unclear whetherHillary caused his prosecution or not. At any rate what the hell wasBobby doing not having a record of $14,000? Not many Americans can beso lucky as to forget where they placed fourteen grand. Maybe aftermany years of such a cushy job with nice perks, he had grown corruptand got caught with his fingers in the till.I'm going to watch the rest of the show this morning and see whetherthey have anything better against Hillary. So far, the main basis theyhave for hating Hillary is that she is not a conservative. They keeprepeating these old clips when she was making a face or having a badhair day. It is really low-level political propaganda at the level ofGoebbels. Really an amateurish production, grabbing at straws, thatpersuades me that the Democrats are right on most of the issues.Hint: anytime you feature Ann Coulter, you've tossed your credibilityout the window. She called presidential candidate Edwards a ""f4gg0+""and just runs off at the mouth every opportunity she gets.
