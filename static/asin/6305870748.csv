His skills and deep philosophy are heralded by family members, training partners, students, and opponents. He is truly a one of a kind individual, but very much like an ""average"" man his age. In the documentary ""Choke"", Gracie allows cameras into his mental and physical preparation for the Japan Vale Tudo 95 tournament. There is great footage of Helio Gracie and of his opinions and observations on Rickson and fighting in general. Also, Rickson's family is covered too; bringing the human aspect to a warrior that has dangerous encounter on the horizon. But it is Rickson himself that is the show and displays a kind of candor that the viewer can relate to. Here is a fighting machine in a dangerous sport, but the man within the machine is as spiritually grounded as they come.Covered also are two other fighters, Koichiro Kimura and Todd Hays. Kimura is a shootfighter willing to risk his health in an event with limited rules. He is confident despite doubt from others. Todd Hays is a kickboxer with goals of Olympic Gold in bobsledding. His intentions are to cash in on the tournament to fund his future dreams of glory.A good look into preparation of an MMA event along with excellent behind the scenes footage too.

(&quot;Vale Tudo&quot; is Portuguese for &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, but the rules are not quite that extreme.)The video takes an in depth look at 3 of the participants.1 - Todd Hays is an all around gifted athlete, with a background in kickboxing.  His mixture and fear are apparent as he attempts to use this event to pay for his Olympic bobsleading dreams.2 - Koichiro Kimura is a Japanese amateur shootfighting champion, who wants nothing more than to test himself against the best.  You get to meet his parents, who are affraid he'll die in the ring.3 - Rickson Gracie is the defending champion, as well as the best of the famous Gracie family.
