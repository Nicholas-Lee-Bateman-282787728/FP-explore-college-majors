X-Files is great don't get me wrong but there is something much more real about Millenium. Sometimes it would get into the supernatural but even then it was more about what we as human beings are capable of. Seriously creepy stuff and without an R rating (though sometimes I wonder how).Of course, Lance Henriksen was born for this role. He's an actor capable of exuding great warmth but also can give a look that says &quot;If you only knew what I know...&quot; Lance is the man. It's too bad he never received a personal Emmy for this role.Even though this isn't really horror, horror directors everywhere should watch this and take notes. Hell, any director could learn from this.

823770,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B000244E2O,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[4, 5]","'Millenium' was one of the finest shows in recent television history.  Created by 'X-Files' mastermind Chris Carter, the show ran on Fox for, sadly, only three seasons.  'Millenium' was one of the grittiest, goriest, and most disturbing shows ever on a network station.The show is filled with violent imagery, symbolic meaning, lots of murders, and a little yellow house.  This first season is basically a murder-of-the-week type format, but along the way bits of the series mythology are slowly dropped.  This mythology would become the series' story arc over its final two seasons and the series moves away a bit from the one-serial-killer-per-episode.Lance Henrickson is simply stunning as Frank Black.  Henrickson rises above his B-movie roots and creates one of the most interesting and complex characters I've ever had the pleasure of seeing.  His performance is fabulously understated and completely believable.  Henrickson's performance makes you believe that Frank Black could be a real person.The only knocks on the show are occassional gaps in narrative and Frank's extremely annoying wife and daughter.  But all the good points outweigh the bad ones.  This was one of the best shows on television, but it was ahead of its time and unfortunately was canceled after three years.  This first year is a wonderful lead-in to the the stellar second and third seasons.So all I have to say is this:  Frank Black is a pimp.",5,Frank Black Is A Pimp,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,1426,"[""'Millenium"", 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'shows', 'recent', 'television', 'history', 'Created', 'X-Files', 'mastermind', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'show', 'ran', 'Fox', 'sadly', 'only', 'three', 'seasons', ""'Millenium"", 'was', 'one', 'grittiest', 'goriest', 'most', 'disturbing', 'shows', 'ever', 'network', 'station.The', 'show', 'filled', 'violent', 'imagery', 'symbolic', 'meaning', 'lots', 'murders', 'little', 'yellow', 'house', 'first', 'season', 'basically', 'murder-of-the-week', 'type', 'format', 'way', 'bits', 'series', 'mythology', 'are', 'slowly', 'dropped', 'mythology', 'would', 'become', 'series', 'story', 'arc', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', 'series', 'away', 'bit', 'one-serial-killer-per-episode.Lance', 'Henrickson', 'simply', 'stunning', 'Frank', 'Black', 'Henrickson', 'B-movie', 'roots', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'complex', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'performance', 'fabulously', 'understated', 'completely', 'believable', 'Henrickson', 'performance', 'believe', 'Frank', 'Black', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'person.The', 'only', 'show', 'are', 'occassional', 'gaps', 'narrative', 'Frank', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'wife', 'daughter', 'good', 'points', 'outweigh', 'bad', 'ones', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'television', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'canceled', 'three', 'years', 'first', 'year', 'wonderful', 'lead-in', 'stellar', 'second', 'third', 'seasons.So', 'have', 'say', 'Frank', 'Black', 'pimp']",Millennium - The Complete First Season
823771,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000244E2O,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[6, 6]","In the 1996 fall TV season, Chris Carter --- at the height of The X-Files success --- decided to take a gamble and come out with another drama series. What he ended up releasing is Millennium. This series takes the conspiracy and monster-of-the-week formula of The X-Files and lets it run. This series is about serial killers and mass murderers. They are the monsters-of-the-week. There's no aliens or mutants, just normal looking individuals who have a few things missing in the head.It stars Lance Henriksen as a burnt-out former FBI profiler (agents who delve into the minds of serial killers to figure out how they tick in order to catch future killers) named Frank Black who has resettled in a quaint and quiet neighborhood of Seattle, WA. But whatever caused him to retire from the FBI hasn't stopped him from helping police agencies on the behest of a private law-enforcement group called The Millennium Group.Each week, Frank is called in to help in a murder investigation that has the look of a ritualistic killing. This series really pushes the boundaries of whats allowed on TV with some of the very disturbing images they show on each episode. The images are not gratuitous since it helps the viewer see what Frank sees. It also helps explains how such images and thoughts can numb a person to the degradation and evil all around them. I would be burnt-out just like Frank is I had to see those things in my head all the time. But with the help of his co-workers within the The Group, he prevails and stays out of the abyss for one more day.Lance Henriksen's Frank Black is the series. Lance seems perfect in the role of Frank Black. The weathered, lined face that seem to have seen more than it should have and his low, gravelly voice makes Frank Black his. I cannot see the Frank character being played by anyone else.Millennium is a series that takes abit of daring to watch and sit through. A series about looking into the minds of serial killers is not for everyone, but should at least be tried. The acting and writing is top-notch. The perpetual doom of the night scenes and the sunny dispositions of the day scenes at Frank's yellow-painted home makes Millennium one of the better-looking series to date. Chris Carter took a daring chance with this series and I think he succeeded. I recommend this series for fans of The X-Files. It is a much superior series to the other serial killer drama, The Profiler.",5,A trip down the darker side of Chris Carter's mind...,1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,2427,"['1996', 'fall', 'TV', 'season', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'height', 'X-Files', 'success', 'decided', 'take', 'gamble', 'come', 'out', 'drama', 'series', 'What', 'ended', 'up', 'releasing', 'Millennium', 'series', 'conspiracy', 'monster-of-the-week', 'formula', 'X-Files', 'run', 'series', 'serial', 'killers', 'mass', 'murderers', 'are', 'monsters-of-the-week', 'aliens', 'mutants', 'just', 'normal', 'looking', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'few', 'things', 'missing', 'head.It', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'burnt-out', 'former', 'FBI', 'profiler', 'agents', 'who', 'delve', 'minds', 'serial', 'killers', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'tick', 'order', 'catch', 'future', 'killers', 'named', 'Frank', 'Black', 'who', 'resettled', 'quaint', 'quiet', 'neighborhood', 'Seattle', 'WA', 'caused', 'retire', 'FBI', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'helping', 'police', 'agencies', 'behest', 'private', 'law-enforcement', 'group', 'called', 'Millennium', 'Group.Each', 'week', 'Frank', 'called', 'help', 'murder', 'investigation', 'look', 'ritualistic', 'killing', 'series', 'really', 'boundaries', 'whats', 'allowed', 'TV', 'very', 'disturbing', 'images', 'show', 'episode', 'images', 'are', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'viewer', 'see', 'what', 'Frank', 'also', 'explains', 'how', 'such', 'images', 'thoughts', 'can', 'numb', 'person', 'degradation', 'evil', 'would', 'be', 'burnt-out', 'just', 'Frank', 'had', 'see', 'things', 'head', 'time', 'help', 'co-workers', 'Group', 'abyss', 'one', 'more', 'day.Lance', 'Henriksen', 'Frank', 'Black', 'series', 'Lance', 'perfect', 'role', 'Frank', 'Black', 'weathered', 'lined', 'face', 'seem', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'low', 'gravelly', 'voice', 'Frank', 'Black', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'Frank', 'character', 'being', 'played', 'anyone', 'else.Millennium', 'series', 'abit', 'daring', 'watch', 'sit', 'A', 'series', 'looking', 'minds', 'serial', 'killers', 'not', 'everyone', 'should', 'least', 'be', 'tried', 'acting', 'writing', 'top-notch', 'perpetual', 'doom', 'night', 'scenes', 'sunny', 'dispositions', 'day', 'scenes', 'Frank', 'yellow-painted', 'home', 'Millennium', 'one', 'better-looking', 'series', 'date', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'took', 'daring', 'chance', 'series', 'think', 'succeeded', 'recommend', 'series', 'fans', 'X-Files', 'much', 'superior', 'series', 'other', 'serial', 'killer', 'drama', 'Profiler']",Millennium - The Complete First Season
823772,A24AUMQRP4P5EE,B000244E2O,Aydin Dilber,"[3, 9]","It is easy to see after viewing the 3 seasons why this show was then cancelled even if was done by Chris Carter of X-Files and 9 seasons fame. Do not get me wrong the show is quite good and addictive but it turns to too much different things in 3 seasons. The atmosphere is X-Files (no wonder with Chris Carter directing and Mark Snow doing the musical score) so if you like X-Files you are going to like this. However as said too many changes from season to season more than likely lost the audience on the road.The first season is probably the best (Chris Carter left after...) as it is a dark murder mystery investigation show. Character well defined and well acted. Also the problem Frank Black has reconciling family life with a wife and daughter with his work investigating serial killers and the very evil of humanity is well shown. The millenium group at this point is nothing out of the ordinary only ex-law enforcement agents consulting on particular crimes.The second season after Chris Carter leaves takes definitely a total different twist. The murder investigations take backseat to the mystery of the millenium group. A lot of mystical and religious elemnts are introduced and also ""funky"" episodes like 'Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense' or 'Satan Got Behind Me' that do not quite fit with the nature of the show and are to say the least distracting. All in all not as good as the first season but still enjoyable. One more thing the last episode is not very believable and is not really explained well in the third season. Warning spoiler----> Frank's Wife dies in this episode.The third season then it turns to 'X-Files Mulder & Sculley wannabe"". Frank is back to FBI is paired with another female agent Emma Hollis but no chemistry like Mulder and Sculley, the episodes turn also to look X-Filish but without capturing the spirit of X-Files. So the show albeit it gains in suspense it goes down the drain at this point for lack of originality and too many twists and turns.",3,Why this show was cancelled - my opinion,1106611200,"01 25, 2005",2005,1989,"['easy', 'see', 'viewing', '3', 'seasons', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'then', 'cancelled', 'even', 'was', 'done', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'X-Files', '9', 'seasons', 'fame', 'Do', 'not', 'get', 'show', 'quite', 'good', 'addictive', 'too', 'much', 'different', 'things', '3', 'seasons', 'atmosphere', 'X-Files', 'wonder', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'directing', 'Mark', 'Snow', 'doing', 'musical', 'score', 'so', 'like', 'X-Files', 'are', 'going', 'like', 'However', 'said', 'too', 'many', 'changes', 'season', 'season', 'more', 'likely', 'lost', 'audience', 'road.The', 'first', 'season', 'probably', 'best', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'left', 'dark', 'murder', 'mystery', 'investigation', 'show', 'Character', 'well', 'defined', 'well', 'acted', 'Also', 'problem', 'Frank', 'Black', 'reconciling', 'family', 'life', 'wife', 'daughter', 'work', 'investigating', 'serial', 'killers', 'very', 'evil', 'humanity', 'well', 'shown', 'millenium', 'group', 'point', 'nothing', 'ordinary', 'only', 'ex-law', 'enforcement', 'agents', 'consulting', 'particular', 'crimes.The', 'second', 'season', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'definitely', 'total', 'different', 'twist', 'murder', 'investigations', 'take', 'backseat', 'mystery', 'millenium', 'group', 'lot', 'mystical', 'religious', 'elemnts', 'are', 'introduced', 'also', 'funky', 'episodes', ""'Jose"", 'Chung', 'Doomsday', 'Defense', ""'Satan"", 'Got', 'Me', 'do', 'not', 'quite', 'fit', 'nature', 'show', 'are', 'say', 'least', 'distracting', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'last', 'episode', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'not', 'really', 'explained', 'well', 'third', 'season', 'Warning', 'spoiler', '>', 'Frank', 'Wife', 'episode.The', 'third', 'season', 'then', 'X-Files', 'Mulder', 'Sculley', 'wannabe', 'Frank', 'back', 'FBI', 'paired', 'female', 'agent', 'Emma', 'Hollis', 'chemistry', 'Mulder', 'Sculley', 'episodes', 'turn', 'also', 'look', 'X-Filish', 'capturing', 'spirit', 'X-Files', 'show', 'gains', 'suspense', 'down', 'drain', 'point', 'lack', 'originality', 'too', 'many', 'twists', 'turns']",Millennium - The Complete First Season
823773,A2EWA6WBOJO1QC,B000244E2O,"bdlion ""Have Gun Will Travel""","[6, 6]","Thank God for intelligent television shows like ""Millennium."" As any fan of this dark yet compelling show already knows, Millennium is a bleak, gritty and gruesome show, but not entirely without hope. Hope is a constant message in this show, the hope that Good can triumph over Evil, and that Man, with all his flaws, is still capable of selfless acts.The most striking thing about Millennium isn't the graphic nature  of the episodes, which are unnerving and striking. It is the sheer intelligence and suspense created in each episode that lasts in one's memory long after the last disc has been played. Chris Carter, the late 90's Rod Serling, has to take most of the credit for having the strength and courage to create an intellectual show with such raw and disturbing subject matter. How he got this show on the air to begin with is a minor miracle.This is not an easy show to watch, as the horrors depicted are quite graphic. What is rewarding is watching venerable actor Lance Henriksen at his finest as the tortured Frank Black. A thousand exhausting and terrible events lie etched in his craggy face. He bears the eyes of a man who has seen too much, and cannot unsee these horrors.Overall, a creepy, moody existentialist masterpiece. Television today, with few exceptions, is relegated to moronic and mindless fare in the form of so-called ""reality"" shows, truly the sugar-high of the masses. A recent news article lauded the extreme success of television shows released on DVD. The reason being is the lack of quality television programs today, while excellent, smart television entertainment is a thing of the past.  Kudos to Fox Studios for releasing Millennium on DVD. I hope the other seasons follow soon. I would rather watch my favorite television shows on DVD time and again than waste a minute on today's dreck.Favorite quote, from the episode ""Weeds:""Woman: ""Why is the killer doing this?

823775,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B000244E2O,C. Middleton,"[9, 9]","Millennium was one of the better television series to air in the nineties. For creator, producer and writer of many of the episodes, Chris Carter, (The X Files) this was a canny and timely show with the hysterics of Y2K spreading across the world, and the many people predicting the end of the planet by the year 2000. For many, this well-made series fed and played on our apocalyptic fears, using the occult, religion, torture, death and destruction as its main themes. For most of us, thankfully, the international computer networks did not fail, and the world did not destroy itself - at that point in time, anyway. However Millennium was extremely well written and produced, and the writer's certainly did their research, delving into biblical prophecy and the many legends and folklore of the esoteric, giving the series a solid credibility that endures today.Frank Black is a retired FBI agent with a gift. He is not your standard ""profiler"", using his psycological knowledge of the human mind to then `enter' the mind of an evil killer. Frank goes a step further, and as he confesses in the pilot series, he has the cursed gift of actually ""becoming"" the evil he so often seeks. He ""knows"" evil and experiences it to the depths of his soul. That's why so many of the evil characters in the series can `recognize' Frank Black; they know that he knows, they often see him as a type of kindred spirit, and as a result, relate and open up to him when other's cannot even get close. To contrast this gift, Frank has a loving home life, a beautiful and understanding wife and lovely daughter. Jordan is a miracle child, as she wasn't supposed to happen, but there's a twist - Jordan seems to have the gift as well, which causes some interesting problems as the series unfolds.In the first season, the viewer is introduced to the Millennium Group, an organization consisting of ex law enforcement, consulting various local police force agencies on particularly difficult or bizarre cases. Frank is a member of Millennium Group, who on the surface seem to be forthright and transparent in their capacity, however, as the series continues, especially once the second season begins, the organization becomes more mysterious, conspiratorial and dark, and not as straightforward as we were first led to believe.This is a six-disc set containing 21 episodes. Depending on personal taste and sensibility, some episodes are better than others, but all of them, to my mind, maintain a high quality in terms of direction, acting and overall production value. If you are a Millennium fan, this collection is a must, as one can simply pull it off the shelf occasionally and enjoy time and again.",5,Playing On Our Apocalyptic Fears,1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,2683,"['Millennium', 'was', 'one', 'better', 'television', 'series', 'air', 'nineties', 'creator', 'producer', 'writer', 'many', 'episodes', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'X', 'Files', 'was', 'canny', 'timely', 'show', 'hysterics', 'Y2K', 'spreading', 'world', 'many', 'people', 'predicting', 'end', 'planet', 'year', '2000', 'many', 'well-made', 'series', 'fed', 'played', 'apocalyptic', 'fears', 'using', 'occult', 'religion', 'torture', 'death', 'destruction', 'main', 'themes', 'most', 'thankfully', 'international', 'computer', 'networks', 'did', 'not', 'fail', 'world', 'did', 'not', 'destroy', 'point', 'time', 'anyway', 'However', 'Millennium', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'written', 'produced', 'writer', 'certainly', 'did', 'research', 'delving', 'biblical', 'prophecy', 'many', 'legends', 'folklore', 'esoteric', 'giving', 'series', 'solid', 'credibility', 'today.Frank', 'Black', 'retired', 'FBI', 'agent', 'gift', 'not', 'standard', 'profiler', 'using', 'psycological', 'knowledge', 'human', 'mind', 'then', 'enter', 'mind', 'evil', 'killer', 'Frank', 'step', 'further', 'pilot', 'series', 'cursed', 'gift', 'actually', 'becoming', 'evil', 'so', 'often', 'evil', 'depths', 'soul', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'evil', 'characters', 'series', 'can', 'recognize', 'Frank', 'Black', 'know', 'often', 'see', 'type', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'result', 'relate', 'open', 'up', 'when', 'other', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'get', 'close', 'contrast', 'gift', 'Frank', 'loving', 'home', 'life', 'beautiful', 'understanding', 'wife', 'lovely', 'daughter', 'Jordan', 'miracle', 'child', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'happen', 'twist', 'Jordan', 'have', 'gift', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'problems', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'viewer', 'introduced', 'Millennium', 'Group', 'organization', 'consisting', 'ex', 'law', 'enforcement', 'consulting', 'various', 'local', 'police', 'force', 'agencies', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'bizarre', 'cases', 'Frank', 'member', 'Millennium', 'Group', 'who', 'surface', 'seem', 'be', 'forthright', 'transparent', 'capacity', 'however', 'series', 'especially', 'once', 'second', 'season', 'organization', 'more', 'mysterious', 'conspiratorial', 'dark', 'not', 'as', 'straightforward', 'were', 'first', 'led', 'believe.This', 'six-disc', 'set', 'containing', '21', 'episodes', 'Depending', 'personal', 'taste', 'sensibility', 'episodes', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'mind', 'maintain', 'high', 'quality', 'terms', 'direction', 'acting', 'overall', 'production', 'value', 'are', 'Millennium', 'fan', 'collection', 'must', 'one', 'can', 'simply', 'pull', 'off', 'shelf', 'occasionally', 'enjoy', 'time', 'again']",Millennium - The Complete First Season
823776,A2BT578J4IZOK6,B000244E2O,"Craobh Rua ""Craobh Rua""","[7, 7]","Created by Chris Carter, ""Millennium"" first appeared on television in 1996. It stars Lance Henriksen as Frank Black, a former FBI Agent who specialised in profiling serial killers. Frank retired from the Bureau after suffering a breakdown and moved from Washington to Seattle. His wife, Catherine, is a clinical social worker and the couple have a daughter called Jordan.Although no longer an agent, Frank hasn't completely severed his ties with the world in which he once worked. He has joined a team of ex-law enforcement agents known as the ""Millennium Group"". Little of the Group's history or structure is given away during the first season, though it does appear to be well connected and has access to a great deal of information. However, only very few members other than Frank are introduced - his main contact is Peter Watts, played by Terry O'Quinn. Nevertheless, those who work for the group appear to be happy to lend their expertise to whatever investigation requires their help. A cop in Seattle before he joined the Bureau, Frank occasionally works with Bob Bletcher - a friend and former colleague at the Seattle PD's homicide department. Given Frank's experience, the bulk of his work continues to focus on suspected serial killers. He also has a very useful gift that helps with investigations. When, for example, he visits a crime scene or views a body, Frank can see what the killer saw - something he describes as both a gift and a curse. However, he is not supposed to be a psychic, nor is his ability supposed to be a form of telepathy : he was simply a very gifted individual who could 'put himself' in the killer's head.In addition to the pilot and the twenty-one episodes of season one, there are some special features on the sixth disc. It's always nice when the extras aren't just out-takes, and the team behind Millennium have clearly put some effort in. There are commentaries on the pilot and another episode (""Gehenna""), though two of the documentaries (one on the making of season one and another on the creating the logo and the title sequence) were what I found most interesting.Given that Chris Carter also created ""The X-Files"", it's perhaps a little unusual that - for this season at least - there isn't anything unusual about the show ! Carter wanted to create a murder-mystery show with a cohesive idea, but without a paranormal thread. Unlike its more famous sibling, ""Millennium"" didn't feature alien autopsies, werewolves, liver-eating mutants or 'black oil' : with only occasional exceptions, the villains are human serial killers.

Frank possesses a unique insight into the criminal mind that allows him to adopt a murderer's viewpoint and make intuitive leaps about his motivations and intentions.  This may seem like a rather convenient ability for moving a plot along, but it also allows creator Chris Carter and his staff to keep a tight focus on the psychology of evil men without relying too heavily on forensic procedure, thus distinguishing itself from other crime dramas.  Hendrikson is the perfect choice for the leading role; his steadiness in the face of horror and his love for his family (Megan Gallagher and Brittany Tiplady) provide a bright spot in the darkness.  Terry Quinn also shines as fellow Millennium Grouper Peter Watts; he will get a lot more to do in the next season.  Standout episodes include ""Pilot"" (Frank's first case for the Group), ""The Judge"" (a man enlists ex-cons to kill for him), ""Lamentation"" (a pivotal episode that introduces the evil Lucy Butler), ""Maranatha"" (a possible Anti-Christ moves through the Russian underworld), and ""Paper Dove"" (a serial killer with mommy issues).",4,Makes me nostalgic for Y2K,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,1410,"['Frank', 'Black', 'Lance', 'Hendrikson', 'former', 'FBI', 'profiler', 'job', 'Millennium', 'Group', 'private', 'law', 'enforcement', 'consultancy', 'firm', 'cataclysmic', 'confrontation', 'good', 'evil', 'coming', 'one', 'top', 'operatives.This', 'grim', 'atmospheric', 'crime', 'drama', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'dark', 'tastes', 'Frank', 'unique', 'insight', 'criminal', 'mind', 'adopt', 'murderer', 'viewpoint', 'make', 'intuitive', 'leaps', 'motivations', 'intentions', 'may', 'seem', 'rather', 'convenient', 'ability', 'moving', 'plot', 'also', 'creator', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'staff', 'keep', 'tight', 'focus', 'psychology', 'evil', 'men', 'relying', 'too', 'heavily', 'forensic', 'procedure', 'thus', 'distinguishing', 'other', 'crime', 'dramas', 'Hendrikson', 'perfect', 'choice', 'leading', 'role', 'steadiness', 'face', 'horror', 'love', 'family', 'Megan', 'Gallagher', 'Brittany', 'Tiplady', 'provide', 'bright', 'spot', 'darkness', 'Terry', 'Quinn', 'also', 'fellow', 'Millennium', 'Grouper', 'Peter', 'Watts', 'will', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'do', 'next', 'season', 'Standout', 'include', 'Pilot', 'Frank', 'first', 'case', 'Group', 'Judge', 'man', 'ex-cons', 'kill', 'Lamentation', 'pivotal', 'episode', 'evil', 'Lucy', 'Butler', 'Maranatha', 'possible', 'Anti-Christ', 'moves', 'Russian', 'underworld', 'Paper', 'Dove', 'serial', 'killer', 'mommy', 'issues']",Millennium - The Complete First Season

The first season deals with serial killers and mass murderers(the formulaic ""monster of the week"" is present). The purely adult content found in all of the 22 episodes may be too strong for some. To me, it's perfect. I haven't seen a network show with this much strong adult content since ""24"" and ""House"".The brilliant Lance Henriksen stars as Frank Black, a crinimal profiler who joins the Millennium Group and investigates with Detective Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich), Detective Keibelhouse (Stephen James Lang) and a partner from the Millenium Group, Peter Watts (the perfectly cast Terry O'Quinn). At home, Frank Black realxes with his wife, Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and their daughter, Jordan (Brittany Tiplady). The balance between the dark and gruesome realities of the outside world and the light and peaceful comforts of the Black Family's yellow house is flawless. But even the yellow house becomes infected with crime during the episode ""Lamentation"".Each episode has its moments. My favorites are ""Pilot"" ""Dead Letters,"" ""522666,"" ""Wide Open,"" ""The Wild and the Innocent,"" ""Force Majeure,"" ""The Thin White Line,"" ""Walkabout,"" and ""Maranatha."" They are so full of suspense and some gory killings that your kids will have severe nightmares if you let them watch them (or if they watch them without you knowing it).

You will feel fright like never before watching some of these episodes. Chris Carter has an out of this world gift for touching nerves of true horror within you. The seemingly impossible catasrophes are shown to be quite possible, and you'll come away from each show wondering if it ever &quot;really could be&quot;...In the first season, viewers get to know Frank Black and his family. We learn about his work in the FBI, his move to Seattle from D.C. where he wants to start fresh on a road less littered with crime and ugliness. Alas, what would the show be without these things!?Frank soon becomes involved in one grisly case after another, helping the secretive Millennium Group solve some pretty weird crimes through his gift of sight through the killer's eyes. We feel his anguish as he witnesses murders too horrid to relive, and we empathize with his inner fears about losing his family to a psycho from his past.Lots of out of this world concepts, blood and gore, creepy devilish story lines...this first season was risque for tv at the time, and by the time the show had its finale, we saw just about everything shy of an NC-17 Rating on television. I hope the rest of the seasons are released soon, because you'll watch this set in a week if you're a die-hard fan like we are. Six DVD's in all, plenty of special features, including behind the scenes making of the pilot and interviews with the primary characters.

823790,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000244E2O,General Zombie,"[12, 12]","I remember watching the ""Millennium"" premiere way back in `96.  I would've had to have been twelve at the time, and though I'd watched ""The X-Files"" from the very beginning and had long had a predilection for horror-oriented entertainment, ""Millennium"" proved a bit much.  The pilot. . .disturbed me.  As did the next episode. And the next, and pretty much every episode I watched of it at the time. Nothin' but serial killers, so it seemed, and the lead was apparently dead as well. It was all just too damned depressing, and I watched it less and less over time.  Nevertheless, it did make a strong impression on me, and I never forgot it.  Still, I didn't think about ""Millennium"" too much for many years, but with the recent DVD revolution, nothing  is going to be forgotten or unavailable for very long, and I recently got through my long-overdue viewing of the first season.  I must say, I'm quite impressed.  At nearly twice my prior age, it doesn't even have a shadow of the original impact, but ""Millennium"" is still an impressively dark, gruesome TV show, particularly in its first season.  And, more to the point, it's just flat-out good.""Millennium"" focuses on one Frank Black and his family as they move to a new home in Seattle.  Frank is a former profiler for the FBI, and this move represents a new beginning for him, his wife Catherine and their young daughter Jordan.  They live in a cute little yellow, suburban house in a picturesque neighborhood with friendly neighbors seemingly transplanted from a `50s sitcom.  Still, as a killer-hunter, Frank is intuitively in tune with the darker side of life, and he can't escape it.  He hasn't really abandoned his old occupation anyway, and he now works as a consultant with the Millennium group which basically amounts to continuing work as a serial killer profiler, but with a, well, millennial bent.  They think that the increase in violent, disturbing crime a symptom of the impending apocalypse, though we don't hear too much more about this during this season.  As it turns out, these elements work best when they're just under the surface, adding a subtle, binding element to the season as a whole.It's difficult to define just what makes ""Millennium"" so effective and so different from most everything else on TV.  It's not one thing, but rather just the overall milieu of the show, an accumulation of a thousand different details.  ""Millennium"" is an admitted ""Seven"" cash-in, and it generates the bleak tone in much the same way, with darkened corridors and endless rain, with biblical and general religious themes, both overt and covert, with a contrast between an idealized, middle class life and the degeneracy of the world as a whole etc.  This final contrast is an aspect which I particularly enjoy.  For whatever reason, the ideas of both utter purity and total depravity particularly intrigue.  Perhaps we don't have much of either in day to day life, at least not in suburban, middle-class American life, but that just makes it all the more interesting I guess.  Still, when it comes to looking at light vs. dark,  ""Millennium"" is much more intimate with the dark.  While it's not shocking the way it once was, ""Millennium"" still proves to be easily the darkest show I've ever seen on network television or non-premium cable.  Though we don't get to see most of it it in much detail, we've got plenty of bad stuff: eyes and mouths are shown shut while the victims are still alive; families are slaughtered while the children are forced to watch; clergyman are burned and tortured alive; teens forced to drink the blood of others; organs are stolen from still-conscious victims etc.  And that's just a small taste of the unremitting grisliness of the show.Lance Henriksen's performance as Frank Black is the key to ""Millennium"".  Henriksen doesn't seem to have a whole lot of range, but what he does he does well, and this show contains some of the best work I've seen of his.  He has to walk a thin line, since Frank is a quiet, largely humorless and cold figure, but Henriksen still imbues him with a certain amount of life, and never makes him seem bored or indifferent.  He isn't dull, but intense and thoughtful  Megan Gallagher is Frank's wife Catherine, and she's not as good, though  still adequate.  Her relative weakness is probably more a fault of how her character was written than how she was performed, but it's a concern either way.  She's just a bit of a drag and a worry wort, frankly.  I'm not sure what Frank sees in her, honestly, though it may have something to do with her being 20 years younger than him.  (Way to go Frank! Put those psychic profiling powers to good use!)  Still, even if I don't especially care about her as a character, I buy that Frank does, and that's good enough.  The other recurring characters are mostly cops, of sorts, and most of them don't make too strong of an impression other than Terry O'Quinn as Peter Watts, Frank's major contact in the Millennium group.  He's not as prominent this season as he'd become, but he O'Quinn still gives nuanced, sympathetic performances which adds a bit more life to the show.Truth be told, I have a hard time coming up with specific standout episodes.  They are all pretty similar, for the most part.  And no, not every episode deals with a crazed killer of some sort, but most of them do.  The ""Pilot"" is still particularly effective, with plenty of nasty ideas, though it is perhaps a bit too obviously derivative of ""Seven"", even as this show goes.  I also especially like ""The Wild and the Innocent"", one of the more unique, episodes, involving a young couples murderous trek across the south in search of their stolen child, and ""Lamentation"", an episode which initially looks like a typical ""Silence of the Lambs"" knockoff, but which moves in unexpected directions and helps bolster the supernatural angle of the show which steadily comes into greater play as the season progresses.  On the plus side, part of the reason why there aren't many particular standouts in my book  is because there are no obvious dud episodes either.On the downside, ""Millennium"" doesn't maintain this quality forever.  Season 2 sees Carter cease to be much involved, and the show moves in a less bleak, more conventionally ""X-Files""-esque direction with some rather bizarre plot developments.  It's far from bad, and perhaps this formula would wear thin after a while, but season 2 is still not as good as the first.  Still, this is what we've got, and it's more than good enough.  Hell, it's pretty surprising that they were able to keep it this unrelenting morbid for as long as they did, so we should consider ourselves lucky to have this much.  Anyway, it you're a fan of pitch-black, horror themed entertainment, you'd be pretty damn stupid not to check out ""Millennium""",5,"4.5.

823793,A1WIZ78S4T2AP2,B000244E2O,J.D.,"[6, 6]","I was 13 when ""Millenium"" premiered and there were certain things I couldn't understand. This series isn't for a 13 year old. I was very excited when the series came out on DVD, and now as a 21 year old I found this ""Millenium"" a harsh, gritty series about a tortured man and his ability.If you didn't know already, the series is about Frank Black, an ex-FBI agent who specializes in sexual homicide. He now works for the shady Millenium Group who are retired FBI, CIA, etc. Frank sees what the killer sees (literally) and his ability helps solve cases and find murderers. The story later arcs into an end times/Nostradamus background, and it works.This is a severely gritty and at times gory series. The pilot episode features people being buried alive and being bled for the satisfaction of the killer. If anything, this series accurately shows us how a serial killer works (if you're into that kinda stuff). You'll see severed body parts, demons, gruesome murders - all stuff that you might not have expected on TV in '96-97 - but, if you've got the stomach for it, you'll find it very rewarding. There's little to no continuity in the series - it's all about Frank nabbing the killer from episode to episode.Lance Henriksen (Frank) has the voice for the part, and constantly leads and takes over every show. He's an underappreciated actor and deserved his Golden Globe nod for his portrayal of Frank. Megan Gallagher and Bill Smitrovich play adequate supporting roles as Frank's wife and friend/detective. Still, the series is all about Frank and his ability.There are some stand out episodes, most that come during the second half of the season. ""The Thin White Line"" is my favorite, where Frank must go back and talk to a serial killer that murdered some of his fellow agents 20 years ago while he worked for the FBI. Meanwhile, the killer's former bunkmate is on a killing spree. Episodes like that are incredible. The second season changed the story arc totally, focusing more on the Millenium Group, but season one is a great setup season and really sets the mold for a series like ""CSI.""",4,"Terrific, gritty series",1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,2097,"['was', '13', 'when', 'Millenium', 'premiered', 'were', 'certain', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'series', ""n't"", '13', 'year', 'old', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'when', 'series', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'now', '21', 'year', 'old', 'found', 'Millenium', 'harsh', 'gritty', 'series', 'tortured', 'man', 'ability.If', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'already', 'series', 'Frank', 'Black', 'ex-FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'sexual', 'homicide', 'now', 'shady', 'Millenium', 'Group', 'who', 'are', 'retired', 'FBI', 'CIA', 'etc', 'Frank', 'what', 'killer', 'sees', 'literally', 'ability', 'solve', 'cases', 'find', 'murderers', 'story', 'later', 'arcs', 'end', 'times/Nostradamus', 'background', 'severely', 'gritty', 'times', 'gory', 'series', 'pilot', 'episode', 'people', 'being', 'buried', 'alive', 'being', 'bled', 'satisfaction', 'killer', 'anything', 'series', 'accurately', 'how', 'serial', 'killer', 'works', ""'re"", 'kinda', 'stuff', ""'ll"", 'see', 'severed', 'body', 'parts', 'demons', 'gruesome', 'murders', 'stuff', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'expected', 'TV', ""'96-97"", ""'ve"", 'got', 'stomach', ""'ll"", 'find', 'very', 'rewarding', 'little', 'continuity', 'series', 'Frank', 'nabbing', 'killer', 'episode', 'episode.Lance', 'Henriksen', 'Frank', 'voice', 'part', 'constantly', 'leads', 'over', 'show', 'underappreciated', 'actor', 'deserved', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'nod', 'portrayal', 'Frank', 'Megan', 'Gallagher', 'Bill', 'Smitrovich', 'play', 'adequate', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Frank', 'wife', 'friend/detective', 'Still', 'series', 'Frank', 'ability.There', 'are', 'stand', 'out', 'episodes', 'most', 'come', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'Thin', 'White', 'Line', 'favorite', 'where', 'Frank', 'must', 'go', 'back', 'talk', 'serial', 'killer', 'murdered', 'fellow', 'agents', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'worked', 'FBI', 'Meanwhile', 'killer', 'former', 'bunkmate', 'killing', 'spree', 'Episodes', 'are', 'incredible', 'second', 'season', 'changed', 'story', 'arc', 'totally', 'focusing', 'more', 'Millenium', 'Group', 'season', 'one', 'great', 'setup', 'season', 'really', 'mold', 'series', 'CSI']",Millennium - The Complete First Season

In retrospect, I think it was one of the best series ever made and benefited from the experience gained by Chris Carter during the making of the X-Files. My friends who watched the series in 1996 said even though it was excellent they had to stop watching it because it affected their sleep! That was about the best endorsement one could give to this type of TV series.Although intrigued by the topic I did not watch it in 96 as I had other fish to fry and other television commitments to keep, but I did rent it and ultimately purchased it from Amazon. I really liked this show and feel Lance Hendrickson was the perfect choice for the role of Agent Frank Black bearing the weight of the world on his shoulders. I also felt the role of his wife was essential for the series, and gave Agent Black a greater purpose and a place to recover from the debilitating effects of his job. I regretted the choice the writers made in killing her character.  This was a truly creepy series and I subsequently purchased the second and third seasons of Millenium. I felt that seasons one and two were the best of the three.I recently watched the entire first and second seasons over again, and the second was darker and more twisted than I remembered from my first screening.

But none of this is gratuitous.

The contrasts between what Frank Black does to support his family and his life at home with them are most poignantly presented and some primal issues are raised:  how do you rear a child into a world of horror that you see so deeply into?  what do you tell her?  how can love survive in this world?  how do you keep insanity at bay?  how do you deal with the contrasts themselves?

823806,A1294FZ6I4M5XH,B000244E2O,Mark Douglas,"[3, 4]","Chris Carter likes to make TV shows about The Truth. 'The X-Files' of course dealt with the truth about aliens and UFOs. And MILLENNIUM is his look at the nature of evil. Whether humans are responsable for creating it within themselves and others or whether there is a higher (or should I say ""lower"") power at work.Overall, MILLENNIUM is one of those shows I just have good memories about. Whatching a new thriller every week, it was great! But then years later after buying this box set and watching the first few episodes I found myself wondering if my memory was right or not!The first half of Season 1 of MILLENNIUM shows the direction creator Chris Carter was really after. A weekly drama featuring serial killers with a design in the vein of films like 'Se7en' and 'Silence of the Lambs' trying to figure out what drives this men to such pure evil. The problem though is that serial killers can get quite old after we've since been exposed to shows like CSI. Sure, MILLENNIUM was first, but we're watching it on DVD here. So after 10 episodes in a row of serial killers is this an indication of what the rest if the season, and the whole series is going to be like? The answer is HELL NO!In the second half of Season 1 it seems that some producers realised that they needed some variety - or maybe it was just that they felt more in comfortable with the characters letting them experiment a bit. But MILLIENNIUM finally kicks into overdrive and mostly drops finding serial killers and starts taking advantage of the emotional connection we have with the characters.Starting with Disc #4 we get into the episodes that feature doomsday cults and more emotional content instead of the unknown victims and killers of the first few discs. Sure there are still killings, but it's a lot less formulaeic and there are actual subplot arcs which start here including one that may reveal why there are so many killers living very near Frank and his family! Something to do with the true face of evil perhaps? ;)The image quality of the DVD seems to be mastered from video masters and because of the long runtime, the compression is a big higher than normal. This means that a lot of the time you'll get little instances where the image degrades because of a fade within the show. All that happens is that details become blocky and straight lines become jagged. I am pleased to say however that I noticed it becomes less common in the later episodes.The sound is simple stereo tho it serves it's purpose. Surround would have been better but I doubt it wouldn't be worth the money for Fox to remaster all the episodes for a not-so-popular show.The extras are alright. They do have a couple of commentaries (sorry, haven't listened to them yet) and a couple of featurettes. The documentary on making MILLENNIUM Season 1 goes for 48 minutes and tells the basic story of how it was developed and features interviews with key creative people like directors and writers talking annecdotes in the context of some key episodes. NB: Notice how the interviewees refer to Morgan/Wong episodes a lot, but those two guys don't feature in this documentary. They are who took control of season 2 and made it all supernatural despite what Chris Carter wanted.The other featurettes are one on real life profilers and a talk about the logo and title sequence by the relavent designers. Okay, but not enthralling. Also on my copy is a behind the scenes look at the recent movie Aliens Vs. Predator. Just promo for Fox I guess.Overall this season served as a great preface for the(...)SECOND season (due out early 2005 by the way).

Now that I'm 20, I purchased this very nice dvd set for under $45 at a local store. This is without a doubt one of the best criminal thriller shows ever made, with some of the episodes dealing with the coming apocalypse rather than just serial killers. I can't believe the gore they allowed on regular cable for this show. You would expect this from an HBO show, but back when Fox actually had good shows on they had the guts to  raise the bar in terms of TV violence. Bravo! Lance Henriksen is brilliant in the role of Frank Black and is always on target with his line delivery and facial expressions. He is the 1st half of what makes this show work. The 2nd half includes a great supporting cast (including the serial killers), the movie-like feel to each episode, the music by Mark Snow of X-Files fame, and the consistency of great episodes with only 3 or 4 of the 22 being average. I haven't seen any episodes from the second season, which I heard is even better than this one, so I can't wait until it comes out.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[21, 21]","I can honestly say that I have waited a long time for Fox to finally have the good sense to bring the cult hit show Millennium to DVD, and now finally it's here.  Created by X-Files creator Chris Carter, Millennium stars Lance Henriksen (you've seen him before in Pumpkinhead, Aliens, Terminator, Near Dark, and he's in the upcoming Alien VS Predator) as former FBI profiler Frank Black who has since moved his family to Seatle.  There, he joins the mysterious Millennium group: a seemingly group of crime busters who investigate some mysterious and brutal crimes.  However, just like on Carter's X-Files, nothing is as it seems, and Carter weaves a web of conspiracy that it soon becomes clear that Frank doesn't know who he can trust.  Henriksen is perfect in his Emmy nominated role, giving what very well could be his best performance ever, and he managed to keep doing it every week until the series' end.  At the time the show premiered, Fox was turning out new shows every season to be a double header with the X-Files (remember Space: Above and Beyond? or Strange Luck?), most of which lasted shortly, but Millennium lasted for a good few seasons until it's ultimate end.

823814,A341BG8RMH8QW,B000244E2O,NotATameLion,"[9, 13]","The first season of Millenium was amongst the greatest seasons of any show ever on television--bar none. Gruesome, yes, but ringing with some of the best writing anywhere, and from Lance Henriksen--a brilliant portrayal of a haunted and broken man. For one brief moment Chris Carter could do no wrong.But man did that moment crash and burn!Please permit me to rail for a moment, and then end with what I feel are some salient and timely remarks:Let us begin by never forgetting what was once within our grasp--truly creative shows (like the X-files and Millenium) that as part of network television gave the public at large strong stand-alone stories while trying to forge them into larger narratives. This has been lost to us now. Worthy shows, those like Six Feet Under and especially Carnival, still carry this on--but for a price on premium cable.Why has our culture at large turned away from that which makes us think for periods of longer than sixty minutes? Is it like the vast turning away from Christianity that has not been tried and found wanting, but rather tried and found hard? Perhaps.But just perhaps it is yet another symptom of a culture ""on the move."" Perhaps even the water-cooler phenomenon has been absorbed and left behind by the ever-consuming but rarely producing ""mobile society."" Even protracted narrative is becoming too intrusive in our increasingly insular lives.We have found it too jarring, to disconcerting and have therefore slammed yet another drawer shut in our lives of compartmentalization. As children of the Most Creative, shutting out the creative is just one more symptom that shows how far we are from what we were and are made to be. What a shame.It does not help that neither Millenium or the X-files finished strongly. I would argue that Millenium, for all the possibilities the initial concept had, fell hardest. The final episodes of the X-files S-U-C-K-E-D, but at least Reyes and Doggett had some good story lines before Carter and the gang gave them a disparate and unworthy Cheers-esque send off.Yet the success of shows like Six Feet Under, Carnival and The Sopranos should be a wake up call to the culture mongers at the big four. There is power in story. There is living water still left in the well of creativity.This first season of Millenium proves my point. No matter where this show ended up (as part of one of the weaker X-files episodes ironically) it was great in the beginning. Hence the four stars.It is not about eating bugs or getting voted off the island. It is about being creatures made in the image of perfection. Imitation is not about flattery; it is what we were made for.The first season of Millenium is amongst the most creative things ever to have been on TV. It may give you nightmares or make you look around corners a bit too much, but I give it a strong recommendation. I'm glad its finally on DVD.",4,THE IMPORTANCE OF FINISHING WELL,1092009600,"08 9, 2004",2004,2879,"['first', 'season', 'Millenium', 'was', 'greatest', 'seasons', 'show', 'ever', 'television', 'bar', 'none', 'Gruesome', 'yes', 'ringing', 'best', 'writing', 'anywhere', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'haunted', 'broken', 'man', 'one', 'brief', 'moment', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'could', 'do', 'wrong.But', 'man', 'did', 'moment', 'crash', 'burn', 'Please', 'permit', 'rail', 'moment', 'then', 'end', 'what', 'feel', 'are', 'salient', 'timely', 'remarks', 'Let', 'begin', 'never', 'forgetting', 'what', 'was', 'once', 'grasp', 'truly', 'creative', 'shows', 'X-files', 'Millenium', 'part', 'network', 'television', 'gave', 'public', 'large', 'strong', 'stand-alone', 'stories', 'trying', 'forge', 'larger', 'narratives', 'been', 'lost', 'now', 'Worthy', 'shows', 'Six', 'Feet', 'especially', 'Carnival', 'still', 'carry', 'price', 'premium', 'cable.Why', 'culture', 'large', 'turned', 'away', 'think', 'periods', 'longer', 'sixty', 'minutes', 'vast', 'turning', 'away', 'Christianity', 'not', 'been', 'tried', 'found', 'wanting', 'rather', 'tried', 'found', 'hard', 'Perhaps.But', 'just', 'perhaps', 'yet', 'symptom', 'culture', 'move', 'Perhaps', 'even', 'water-cooler', 'phenomenon', 'been', 'absorbed', 'left', 'behind', 'ever-consuming', 'rarely', 'producing', 'mobile', 'society', 'Even', 'protracted', 'narrative', 'becoming', 'too', 'intrusive', 'increasingly', 'insular', 'lives.We', 'have', 'found', 'too', 'jarring', 'disconcerting', 'have', 'therefore', 'slammed', 'yet', 'drawer', 'shut', 'lives', 'compartmentalization', 'children', 'Most', 'Creative', 'shutting', 'out', 'creative', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'symptom', 'how', 'far', 'are', 'what', 'were', 'are', 'made', 'be', 'What', 'shame.It', 'not', 'help', 'Millenium', 'X-files', 'finished', 'strongly', 'would', 'argue', 'Millenium', 'possibilities', 'initial', 'concept', 'had', 'fell', 'hardest', 'final', 'episodes', 'X-files', 'S-U-C-K-E-D', 'least', 'Reyes', 'Doggett', 'had', 'good', 'story', 'lines', 'Carter', 'gang', 'gave', 'disparate', 'unworthy', 'Cheers-esque', 'send', 'success', 'shows', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Carnival', 'Sopranos', 'should', 'be', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'culture', 'mongers', 'big', 'four', 'power', 'story', 'living', 'water', 'still', 'left', 'well', 'creativity.This', 'first', 'season', 'Millenium', 'point', 'matter', 'where', 'show', 'ended', 'up', 'part', 'one', 'weaker', 'X-files', 'episodes', 'ironically', 'was', 'great', 'beginning', 'Hence', 'four', 'stars.It', 'not', 'eating', 'bugs', 'getting', 'voted', 'island', 'being', 'creatures', 'made', 'image', 'perfection', 'Imitation', 'not', 'flattery', 'what', 'were', 'made', 'for.The', 'first', 'season', 'Millenium', 'amongst', 'most', 'creative', 'things', 'ever', 'have', 'been', 'TV', 'may', 'give', 'nightmares', 'make', 'look', 'corners', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'give', 'strong', 'recommendation', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'DVD']",Millennium - The Complete First Season

823816,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000244E2O,OverTheMoon,"[14, 14]","The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. Between 1996 and 1997 the X-Files creators made a new type of television show with the same high quality production values called Millennium.At around 950 minutes per box, you are looking at 3 boxes with approx. 47 hours worth of viewing. So you have 2 days of non-stop Millennium if you get the whole collection. Millennium finished in Season 3 in 1999, a 3 season span is still considered a very good run (when compared to most television shows that only last a season) but paled in comparison to its contemporary X-Files parent than ran for 9 seasons and one movie. There is also one crossover episode with the X-Files. It should be seen last after the end of Millennium Season three and is found in the X-Files Season seven, episode four: Millennium.The X-Files creator Chris Carter wanted to concentrate on human evil rather than just the paranormal and so developed the idea of a new show with more adult themes than what his mainstream creation, the X-Files, was doing at the time. This meant that instead of aiming at a teenage and family audiences Carter would create stories about extreme iniquity aimed squarely at adults. The result is a very dark, scary and often mind shattering experience. You don't enjoy Millennium, you go through with it.Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is a former homicide detective turned private investigator with the Millennium group who hunts killers using his special profiling techniques. The series is set during the end of the 1990s and is focused on the end time events as expected by apocalyptic cults in the run-up to the year 2000. While working on individual cases Frank Black is sometimes teamed up with members of the Millennium group such as Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn), works alongside Lt. Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) and often talks about his work with his wife Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher) and entertains his daughter Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady), both who are being threatened by a mysterious serial killer at large whom Frank cannot trace. Most episodes play along with the theme of Frank Black being called to investigate a case only for his family to become involved while he is trying his best to keep them away from what he does.The DVD case is nothing special but more importantly the six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically Millennium is sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are usually 4 episodes per disc, and 6 discs in total for a grand total of 22 episodes (last disc has only 2 episodes). There are no commentaries and no bonus material. They could have at least provided us with the Millennium remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. Since the show was shot in full frame, these dimensions are retained.Millennium: Season one is as hard as adult dramas can get. It frequently contains sex related crime themes and horror. In many ways the show is more disturbing than expected coming from its X-Files production background. Millennium is devoid of any humour, is often very squeamish and many episodes push the psychological boundaries beyond disturbing. While some episodes are somewhat tame on the gore and psychological peril, other episodes are the kind you wished you never saw. When Millennium pushes the tension factor up it usually decides to go well beyond the 10. For this reason you never know if the episode you are watching will be an interesting one or an episode that just suddenly turns very nasty without warning. It is hard to imagine another television series that hit as hard as Millennium did when it was first aired.Season one of Millennium is about the Millennium group, cults, troubled profilers, priest murders, body parts, serial bombers, funeral murders, incest, security systems, child kidnapping, sins, rape drugs, related suicides, copycat killers, kidnappers, filicide, hallucinogens, prison escapees, Satanism, animal mutilations, the apocalypse and matricide.The most popular episodes are Gehenna, The Judge, Weeds, `Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions' and Maranatha. Broken World stands out as probably the most edge-of-your-seat thriller episode that Millennium has to offer. Lamentation has a shocking twist.Overall Millennium is certainly not for everybody. Even some fans of the X-Files will find that its core theme of sex crimes and violence is as far from Mulder and Skully as you can get, however if you like the production values of the X-Files then Millennium is just that and then some more. Not many people will want to get inside the head of Frank Black but if you find that a tough gritty crime thriller series is your cup of tea then it doesn't get much tougher than Millennium.",5,You don't enjoy Millennium.

Chris Carter is never one to pull punches on a commentary as we have witnessed on a couple of the XFILES discs. Here he and David Nutter extend a much deserved thank you to the cast crew, as well as bringing new light to the material. After sitting through the first two episodes again I am blown away by the level of detail and care that are evident on the screen, seemingly every production descision was lovingly and thoughtfully made.

Rose ""Rainman""","[6, 7]","Now for me to say that is sacrilegious but to be honest, there are episodes of the first season of Millennium that outdo the best of the best of the X-Files. Sometimes it's like comparing Angel to Buffy! Buffy is great, groundbreaking, fantastic but there are episodes of Angel that are just unbelievably amazing! Same goes for Millennium!First, there's the writing. Chris Carter was channeling some amazing juju when he came up with the show. The episodes he writes (and many of the other ones) are tight. Almost perfect examples in great TV writing! Secondly, the mood. The whole show is about atmosphere. It's about descending to another level for an hour and just surrounding yourself in a great, creepy story. This is done by lighting, cinematography, editing, and Mark Snow's great soundtrack! Even Mark goes one better from the X-Files and delivers truly fantastic and mood-setting music. Lastly and most importantly, there's the acting. Lance Henriksen is so believable as Frank Black. He utterly makes you believe. Megan Gallagher and a younger Terry O'Quinn (with hair!) make for a amazing cast. But it's all about Lance! He's the reason that you watch.This show isn't for everyone.

Unfortunately, it made the same mistake X-Files did and the plots just went too far overboard with all the conspiracy theory nonsense.  Millennium was at its best getting into the minds of people, and why they do some of the things they do.  Frank Black walks a tightrope dealing with it all.

It did not blow me away at first, but I was certainly intrigued.  As I watched I found that I did enjoy this series, though not quite as much as the X-Files.  The reason for the 3-star rating is mainly because while I enjoy the one-off, serial killer of the week, format, I am a big fan of mythology arcs.  If this season had focused a bit more on mythology it would have earned another star.  That said, the few episodes that were hinting at an underlying, connected story we among my favorites, and the episodes leading up to the finale were quite good.

823827,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,B000244E2O,Robert Blake,"[5, 6]","10 years after it first premiered ""Millennium"" is finally beginning to receive the kind of recognition it first deserved. Chris Carter's second creation after the highly successful ""The X-Files"" is a brilliant look at evil and the kind of madness present in our world. The show only lasted 3 seasons and it wasn't cancelled due to low quality, it simply could not compete with it's big brother. ""The X-Files"" is easily the most influential, popular TV drama of the 90's, but ""Millennium"" is now beginning to really flower with the kind of cult status that has saved countless movies and TV shows from being forgotten. Lance Henriksen is a masterful casting choice as Frank Black, a retired FBI profiler who now works with the Millennium Group, a consulting group that helps with serial murder cases but believes the world is edging over so closer to an unclear apocalypse. The concept in 1996 was intriguing, especially since the actual millennium was only a few years away, but now in the post-September 11 world it's downright frightening, since one year into the millennium a horrific terror did in fact come to pass and the world has completely been turned around with wars brewing and cultures clashing. A total apocalypse? Probably not, but not exactly things that should be brushed away. Shining episodes in Seasone One include the acclaimed ""Pilot"" episode which Carter still states best represents what he wanted to do with the series and ""Weeds,"" a powerful story that shows how violence and terror can still find it's way into the most pleasant-looking society. With ""Millennium"" Carter uses fiction to touch upon a frightening reality which is that people have forgotten what evil is or that it even exists. Science and liberalism have made people try and discard the idea that true evil exists, and as much as science has been a blessing, there are still terrible things in the world we simply cannot explain with any secular means. Black has been cursed with the gift of being able to look into the killer's mind and see the terror. The production credits of ""Millennium"" are superb and with it's haunting music by ""X-Files"" maestro Mark Snow, stellar scripts and edgy cinematography, ""Millennium"" is one of those special shows produced with an eye towards the cinematic instead of just regular TV. Had Carter not been tied down by his growing responsibilities to ""The X-Files"" (including the making of the movie in 1998), ""Millennium"" would no doubt have found better footing.

823832,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B000244E2O,Tim Janson,"[1, 1]","Millennium was, and remains one of the scariest TV shows ever. It had an air of creepiness that permeated the show for its entire run. Some shows can do this for an episode or two, but to do it over three seasons is quite an accomplishment. Frank Black, a former FBI agent just wants to escape that life and moves to Seattle with his family. But Franks ability for not only profiling serial killers, but to put himself in their heads, soon leads him to the Millennium Group, and the apocalyptic approaching year 2000.Lance Henrickson was perfect as Frank Black. His perfectly downplayed, even morose character fit the tone of the show perfectly. He was certainly a hero, but one who no longer wanted a life of pursuing killers and even WORSE things. Terry O'Quinn, a marvelous character actor plays Peter Watts, Franks contact with the Millennium group.Throughout its brief three year run the show would consistently make for outstanding, spine-chilling TV. There has been nothing remotely like it since. Towards the end of the final season Frank even had a crossover with Mulder and Scully from the X-files.The set comes with all season one 22 episodes. There is commentary on two of the episodes and a few other features. Personally I would have loved to have had commentary on more than two episodes simply because I found this show and its characters to unique that I wanted to have more insight into them.Season One HighlightsThe PilotFrank Black, his wife Catherine, and their daughter Jordan move to Seattle. When Frank reads of the murder of a peep show dancer, he goes to the Seattle PD to meet with Bob Bletcher - Frank used to work Seattle Homicide with Bletcher before joining with the FBI. Frank has insight on the case - he has the ability to place himself in the mind of these killers. When another victim is found, Frank helps leads them to a buried coffin marked with the word Peste. Peter Watts, of the Millennium Group, whom Frank is consulting for, examines the dancer's body and finds a needle prick. Frank analyzes a video tape from the peep show and is able to pick out the words the killer spoke as he watched the dancer - verses from Yeats, the Bible, Nostradamus. He believes he is fulfilling prophecy.Dead LettersFrank and a new candidate for the Group track a killer who leaves microscopic messages. Frank sees himself in the young recruit, who is battling many demons of his own, and who almost throws the case due to his erratic and violent behavior.Kingdom ComeFrank investigates the death of clergy, killed by means of medieval torture. Frank realizes the cross-country deaths must be related, and ties the killings to one man, and his gradual loss of faith.The JudgeA self-appointed judge recruits young ex-cons to mete out his version of justice - avenging the wrongfully accused and abused by killing and mutilating the &quot;guilty&quot;. The Judge's justice backfires on him when one of his charges accuse and convict him of hypocrisy.522666A crazed bomber, who gets sexual pleasure from watching his creations explode in public places, leaves the phone tones 522666 as his signature. Frank is called in to help find the bomber, but it is Frank's life that's on the line as the bomber takes a liking to Frank and works him into his plan to gain fame.Blood RelativesA bizarre grave side murder calls for the talents of both Frank and Catherine. Frank homes in on a suspect, a recent parolee and victim of the foster care system; but though he admits to attending funerals, he contends his innocence. Frank realizes that the boy did not commit the crimes, but an older boy infatuated with him did.The Wild and the InnocentA reopened murder case takes Frank to rural Missouri, where he's soon in pursuit of a different killer who's on the run with a mysterious young woman on a determined quest.Force MajeureThe similarity in the suicides of a group of co-eds leads Frank and Peter to a mysterious group headed by a man in an iron lung. Odder still, all members of the group appear to be clones of one another.The Thin White LineFrank is forced to confront painful memories of his early days in the FBI, when a jailed killer appears to be committing more crimes from prison.WalkaboutAfter participating in a bizarre drug trial, which he does not remember, Frank tries to figure out the connection between the drug and a series of deaths. He uncovers a devious plan and the motives of the man behind it.LamentationFrank is called by the FBI to help find escaped serial killer Ephraim Fabricant, who Frank helped put away years ago. He was under sedation after donating a kidney to his sister. Peter Watts helps out and finds that Fabricant married a pen pal, Lucy Butler. Lucy insists she has not seen Fabricant. While there, Lucy gets email that contains reference to Frank's home address -- he calls Catherine, who is safe. He asks her to look in the mail - photos of an Asian judge are in an unmarked envelope. Fabricant walks into a hospital drenched in blood - someone removed his second kidney. Catherine finds it in her fridge. She sees a woman in her house, who looks like Lucy.Broken WorldFrank has the opportunity to stop a serial killer before any humans become involved after a series of horse mutilations tips him off.MaranthanaFrank travels to New York City, to help investigate the deaths of Russian immigrants. The investigation leads to a man responsible for Chernobyl, who many in the community believe is the anti-Christ.",5,SCARIEST TV SHOW...EVER!!!,1090800000,"07 26, 2004",2004,5473,"['Millennium',

823834,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000244E2O,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 2]","Chris Carter's first follow up series to his hit &quot;The X-Files&quot; used a concept that would have seemed right at home on his other series; as the Millennium arrives, it seems that strange things are beginning to happen and that, maybe, these strange things represent some sort of conspiracy that will, ultimately, lead to the end of the world. Frank Black, former profiler, gets called back into service to help the Millennium Group which is to Black what the FBI is to &quot;The X-Files&quot;. These bizarre occurances include kidnappings, serial murders with unusual circumstances, ritualistic sacrifices and many of the other things that Mulder and Scully might experience themselves. Except that Black begins to notice strange things happening within the Millennium Group itself suggesting that it may be playing a part in the larger scheme of things.Much darker in tone and set on the west coast (as opposed to &quot;The X-Files&quot; primary setting in Washington DC), &quot;Millennium&quot; had a strong first season with Carter working with many of the folks that contributed to the strangest and darkest episodes of &quot;The X-Files&quot;. My only complaint is that &quot;Millenium&quot; tends to take less risks than &quot;The X-Files&quot; by turning genre conventions on their heads and playing with the very format that it works within.That said, &quot;Millennium&quot; didn't have as much time to grow up and it did so in a very public forum whereas &quot;The X-Files&quot; rose from obscurity to become a powerhouse series. Expectations were high for this fine series and comparisons to its sister production put &quot;Millennium&quot; at a disadvantage for most critics. Borrowing the look, feel and texture of David Fincher's &quot;Sev7n&quot; and combining it with the tone of its sister series meant that comparisons were going to happen.Lance Henriksen (&quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Near Dark&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;) plays Black with an edge just poking up beneath his calm, placcid surface. His anchor to reality and sanity are his wife and daughter. Terry O'Quinn (&quot;The Stepfather&quot; and &quot;The X-Files: Fight the Future&quot;) plays Black's &quot;boss&quot; the person that Black reports to throughout the first season.Priced just right (unlike &quot;The X-Files&quot;)&quot;Millennium&quot; looks quite good on DVD. The dark look of the series can be a challenge for transfer to DVD particularly when four episodes reside on each disc but the transfers look detailed with sharp image and nice contrast as well as solid blacks. There are some digital artifacts (due to the compression used and the high level of detail in the dark images) but they aren't distracting. We get a couple of nicely done commentary tracks that discuss the challenge of producing this series and a couple of nice featurettes that enlighten fans a bit more about the genesis of the series itself.A nicely done set that will wet any fan's appetite for more, this is the first of set of the three seasons that will appear on DVD. Hopefully Fox will include the concluding one hour episode that aired as a part of &quot;The X-Files&quot; so fans of this series (who might not be X-fans)can have the closing chapter of the show.",4,The Millennium appears...,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,3270,"['Chris', 'Carter', 'first', 'follow', 'up', 'series', 'hit', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'used', 'concept', 'would', 'have', 'seemed', 'right', 'home', 'other', 'series', 'Millennium', 'strange', 'things', 'are', 'beginning', 'happen', 'maybe', 'strange', 'things', 'represent', 'sort', 'conspiracy', 'will', 'ultimately', 'lead', 'end', 'world', 'Frank', 'Black', 'former', 'profiler', 'called', 'back', 'service', 'help', 'Millennium', 'Group', 'Black', 'what', 'FBI', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'bizarre', 'occurances', 'include', 'kidnappings', 'serial', 'murders', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'ritualistic', 'sacrifices', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'might', 'experience', 'Black', 'notice', 'strange', 'things', 'happening', 'Millennium', 'Group', 'suggesting', 'may', 'be', 'playing', 'part', 'larger', 'scheme', 'things.Much', 'darker', 'tone', 'set', 'west', 'coast', 'opposed', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'primary', 'setting', 'Washington', 'DC', 'quot', 'Millennium', 'quot', 'had', 'strong', 'first', 'season', 'Carter', 'working', 'many', 'folks', 'contributed', 'strangest', 'darkest', 'episodes', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'only', 'complaint', 'quot', 'Millenium', 'quot', 'take', 'less', 'risks', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'turning', 'genre', 'conventions', 'heads', 'playing', 'very', 'format', 'said', 'quot', 'Millennium', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'grow', 'up', 'did', 'so', 'very', 'public', 'forum', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'rose', 'obscurity', 'become', 'powerhouse', 'series', 'Expectations', 'were', 'high', 'fine', 'series', 'comparisons', 'sister', 'production', 'put', 'quot', 'Millennium', 'quot', 'disadvantage', 'most', 'critics', 'Borrowing', 'look', 'feel', 'texture', 'David', 'Fincher', 'quot', 'Sev7n', 'quot', 'combining', 'tone', 'sister', 'series', 'meant', 'comparisons', 'were', 'going', 'happen.Lance', 'Henriksen', 'quot', 'Aliens', 'quot', 'quot', 'Near', 'Dark', 'quot', 'quot', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Third', 'Kind', 'quot', 'Black', 'edge', 'just', 'poking', 'up', 'calm', 'placcid', 'surface', 'anchor', 'reality', 'sanity', 'are', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'quot', 'Stepfather', 'quot', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'Fight', 'Future', 'quot', 'Black', 'quot', 'quot', 'person', 'Black', 'first', 'season.Priced', 'just', 'right', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'quot', 'Millennium', 'quot', 'quite', 'good', 'DVD', 'dark', 'look', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'challenge', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'particularly', 'when', 'four', 'episodes', 'reside', 'disc', 'transfers', 'look', 'detailed', 'sharp', 'image', 'nice', 'contrast', 'as', 'well', 'solid', 'blacks', 'are', 'digital', 'artifacts', 'due', 'compression', 'used', 'high', 'level', 'detail', 'dark', 'images', 'are', ""n't"", 'distracting', 'get', 'couple', 'nicely', 'done', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'discuss', 'challenge', 'producing', 'series', 'couple', 'nice', 'featurettes', 'enlighten', 'bit', 'more', 'genesis', 'series', 'itself.A', 'nicely', 'done', 'set', 'will', 'wet', 'fan', 'appetite', 'more', 'first', 'set', 'three', 'seasons', 'will', 'appear', 'DVD', 'Hopefully', 'Fox', 'will', 'include', 'concluding', 'one', 'hour', 'episode', 'aired', 'part', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'fans', 'series', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'X-fans', 'can', 'have', 'closing', 'chapter', 'show']",Millennium - The Complete First Season

Is there some real evil entity, a ""devil"" if you will, that helps create these people without concience who can kill without remorse?  Could the serial killer phenomena be part of something bigger at work?  Frank Black begins to wonder.And as this series unfolds, (especially in season 2) it is apparent that the Millennium Group has some ideas on the topic as well.  Frank Black works for them as a consultant in Seattle, Washington.  In fact, Frank and the group find a great number of killers who believe they are playing some part in the apocalypse as described in the book of Revelation or the writings of Nostrodamas.  Not all of them, but these people obviously see things ""differently,"" and it's Franks job to see what they see so he can catch them before they kill again.That is the intriguing premise, and maybe it wasn't as accessible to some as the UFO mythology of the X-files, but they missed out.Was the show dark?  Certainly.  But it was brilliantly acted and directed too.  Each episode is better than most movie thrillers about cops vs. killers I've seen.  I'm not dumping on The X-files.  I was a fan of that show too, but really the first season of X-files was sort of uneven (see my review of that boxed set).  Millennium was top notch from season one.  And season two was even better.  I think Chris Carter must really be proud of this show.  He and everyone involved, Lance Henriksen, ALL of the actors, the producers, the music of Mark Snow...it all adds up to a landmark show that deserves it's due.And now it gets it on DVD.",5,A Truly Bold and Intense drama series.

Dillon,"[7, 7]","From its somber music by Mark Snow and the jarring images during its credits to its high standard of storytelling, direction and acting, ""Millennium"" set a new standard for excellence on television.Frank Black was a man cursed with a horrible ability to see within the minds of human monsters.  He continually wrestled with demons from within and without, grounded by the love of his family.The weekly excursions into the heart of darkness turned off some viewers who were unwilling to venture there but enthralled others who were willing to take the trip.  Three of these episodes have haunted me since I first saw them back in 1996 and 1997: ""The Pilot"", ""The Thin White Line"" and ""Lamentation.""  At its best, ""Millennium"" was the finest hour on televsion.  It is a series that I sorely miss and thankfully the first season is now available on DVD.

Some of the content is difficult to stomach let alone realize it was on TV*. (*See the Pilot)Lance Hendrickson has that `instant credibility' that is missing from exactly 99.99% of current television. He is a great lead and simply has the exact chemistry the show demands.The imagery of the show is so unique it is in and of itself a work of art. How many shows could you turn the sound down on and simply `experience`?? Few. Current shows? None.Megan Gallagher is also a plus, she is beautiful and simply seems at home in the confines of the set. `Jordan`, the daughter is also pretty good at times, but seems to be a bit young for the show. Terry O' Quinn, ahh, the Stepfather return-eth! Great. I love this guy a lot too. The villains are also almost always up to par, which is crucial to a show of this nature. Love the Judge!Fair extra's, wonderful packaging (much better than the awkward-flimsy-cardboard X-files-junk), the price is spot on, and it has great picture and sound. Wow, I still can't believe I own this!That there weren't 15 or 20 seasons of the X-files to be made for DVD or this may never have come out... (did all 9 seasons @ $1?0 a pop, really need to come out before this superior show...?)Special kudos to the young actress who played the young mother in the episode which should have been titled simply... `Angel.' I didn't take the time to find the name in the credits but she really is gifted.I OWN SEASON ONE OF MILLENNIUM!Lows:Few. But here goes...Ok, the casting seems a bit stiff in terms of the people Lance (Frank Black) works with. They seem fairly `typical TV show' cardboard cut outs. Stiff cop types that seem more like human road blocks/speed bumps than actors, the X-files seems to suffer from this same problem. ""I don't know Frank...."" You'll hear a lot of... even though he's always right!Most of the shows are fairly `anti-climatic'.As much as I love Frank and Katherine separately I must say the chemistry between them is generally lacking. It is serviceable, but often flat. More like a cool professionalism than a marriage. I can understand the character Frank being dark, but there just should be more moments of levity, probably more the writers fault than the actors. The show needs to be somber but that approach is often taken to an extreme.Waiting another Millennium for season II!In Conclusion:If you are even on the fence about this show, don't be. I often have `romantic' notions of old shows I used to watch that sometimes don't pan out (I won't even go into the Land of the Lost DVD fiasco), but on the strength of Lance Hendrickson alone, this is a worthy buy on all counts.",5,I waited a Millennium for this!,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,2798,"['Highs', 'as', 'cryptic', 'remember', '96', 'encounter', 'still', 'lot', 'going', 'terms', 'being', 'something', 'cutting', 'edge', 'television', 'content', 'difficult', 'stomach', 'let', 'alone', 'realize', 'was', 'TV*', 'Pilot', 'Lance', 'Hendrickson', 'instant', 'credibility', 'missing', 'exactly', '99.99', '%', 'current', 'television', 'great', 'lead', 'simply', 'exact', 'chemistry', 'show', 'demands.The', 'imagery', 'show', 'so', 'unique', 'work', 'art', 'How', 'many', 'shows', 'could', 'turn', 'sound', 'down', 'simply', 'experience', 'Few', 'Current', 'shows', 'None.Megan', 'Gallagher', 'also', 'plus', 'beautiful', 'simply', 'home', 'confines', 'set', 'Jordan', 'daughter', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'times', 'be', 'bit', 'young', 'show', 'Terry', 'O', 'Quinn', 'ahh', 'Stepfather', 'return-eth', 'Great', 'love', 'guy', 'lot', 'too', 'villains', 'are', 'also', 'almost', 'always', 'par', 'crucial', 'show', 'nature', 'Love', 'Judge', 'Fair', 'wonderful', 'packaging', 'much', 'better', 'awkward-flimsy-cardboard', 'X-files-junk', 'price', 'spot', 'great', 'picture', 'sound', 'Wow', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'own', 'were', ""n't"", '15', '20', 'seasons', 'X-files', 'be', 'made', 'DVD', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'did', '9', 'seasons', '@', '1', '0', 'pop', 'really', 'need', 'come', 'out', 'superior', 'show', 'Special', 'kudos', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'young', 'mother', 'episode', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'titled', 'simply', 'Angel', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'find', 'name', 'credits', 'really', 'gifted.I', 'OWN', 'SEASON', 'ONE', 'OF', 'MILLENNIUM', 'Lows', 'Few', 'here', 'Ok', 'casting', 'bit', 'stiff', 'terms', 'people', 'Lance', 'Frank', 'Black', 'seem', 'fairly', 'typical', 'TV', 'show', 'cardboard', 'cut', 'outs', 'Stiff', 'cop', 'types', 'seem', 'more', 'human', 'road', 'blocks/speed', 'bumps', 'actors', 'X-files', 'suffer', 'same', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Frank', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'lot', 'even', 'always', 'right', 'Most', 'shows', 'are', 'fairly', ""anti-climatic'.As"", 'much', 'love', 'Frank', 'Katherine', 'separately', 'must', 'say', 'chemistry', 'generally', 'lacking', 'serviceable', 'often', 'flat', 'More', 'cool', 'professionalism', 'marriage', 'can', 'understand', 'character', 'Frank', 'being', 'dark', 'there', 'just', 'should', 'be', 'more', 'moments', 'levity', 'probably', 'more', 'writers', 'fault', 'actors', 'show', 'be', 'somber', 'approach', 'often', 'taken', 'extreme.Waiting', 'Millennium', 'season', 'II', 'Conclusion', 'are', 'even', 'fence', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'often', 'have', 'romantic', 'notions', 'old', 'shows', 'used', 'watch', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'pan', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'go', 'Land', 'Lost', 'DVD', 'fiasco', 'strength', 'Lance', 'Hendrickson', 'alone', 'worthy', 'buy', 'counts']",Millennium - The Complete First Season

They move to Seattle but a peaceful existence is made difficult by Frank's talents in solving serious crimes, often involving serial killers and even otherworldly phenomena. He finds himself drawn into helping the secretive Millenium group, comprising former officers and federal agents. Terry O'Quinn plays Peter Watts, Frank's main link to the group.
