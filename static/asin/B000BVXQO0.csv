Although it might take you a few times doing it to pick up all the dance moves, I still highly recommend it. Another awesome plus is the instructor are very positive and upbeat (and a little silly!) I will definitely be purchasing more in the YBB series.",5,Great & FUN!,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,371,"['Love', 'workout', 'not', 'burlesque', 'style', 'thought', 'still', 'love', 'very', 'fun', 'moving', 'might', 'take', 'few', 'times', 'doing', 'pick', 'up', 'dance', 'moves', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'awesome', 'instructor', 'are', 'very', 'positive', 'upbeat', 'little', 'silly', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'purchasing', 'more', 'YBB', 'series']",N/A

I did not even break a sweat or feel like it was even the least bit challenging. I felt that the movement were choppy and just didn't blend from one exercise to the next. There was some eastern ""OM"" type breathing and exercises which I thought were just weird. There wasn't much burlesque/cabaret to it. I thought it would be fun but it just wasn't all that fun in my opinion.",2,Choppy aerobic workout,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,468,"['cute', 'music', 'people', 'video', 'workout', 'just', 'not', 'much', 'workout', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'break', 'sweat', 'feel', 'was', 'even', 'least', 'bit', 'challenging', 'felt', 'movement', 'were', 'choppy', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'blend', 'one', 'exercise', 'next', 'was', 'eastern', 'OM', 'type', 'breathing', 'thought', 'were', 'just', 'weird', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'burlesque/cabaret', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'fun', 'opinion']",N/A
950940,A23LYK2N6DNIW7,B000BVXQO0,P. Kalafarski,"[0, 0]","I want to like this DVD, especially since everyone seems to be having such a great time, but it has too many things wrong with it.  It was a library loan, and I chose to do it one evening when my regular cardio class was cancelled.  First off, it's 30 minutes long....really, a 30 minute DVD?  With no extra features?  That's pretty cheap.  And only 30 minutes for cardio?  That's not a long time, you really don't start sweating and getting the heart rate going enough to do any good until the 20 minute mark so an extra 10 is not really all that beneficial.  And while I never had dance lessons I've always caught onto steps quickly....if they're explained to me, just once is all I need but I need it.  With only a 30 minute routine (did I mention it's only 30 minutes long?) there would have been plenty of time available on the disc for a quick optional demonstration of the moves.  The fact is, I can't benefit from a workout if I'm standing studying how to do the moves, you can't just call out ""come hither"" and expect me to know what you're doing.  Finally, fine if you want to throw in all that yoga language but know that many of us are not yoga-savvy and an explanation of the terms you are using would have been educational for me as well as to help me understand why the move is helpful and what it does.  No explanation of terms, no demonstration of moves and too short a cardio workout.  However, what I did do was fun, and I suppose plenty of people would overlook my complaints...or do it enough times that they finally get the moves even without a demonstration.  But if you're looking for good cardio, I think there are better DVDs out there.",3,Not Enough Demonstration of Moves,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,1662,"['want', 'like', 'DVD', 'especially', 'everyone', 'be', 'having', 'such', 'great', 'time', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'wrong', 'was', 'library', 'loan', 'chose', 'do', 'one', 'evening', 'when', 'regular', 'cardio', 'class', 'was', 'cancelled', 'First', '30', 'minutes', 'long', '.really', '30', 'minute', 'DVD', 'extra', 'features', 'pretty', 'cheap', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'cardio', 'not', 'long', 'time', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'sweating', 'getting', 'heart', 'rate', 'going', 'enough', 'do', 'good', '20', 'minute', 'mark', 'extra', '10', 'not', 'really', 'beneficial', 'never', 'had', 'dance', 'lessons', ""'ve"", 'always', 'caught', 'steps', 'quickly', ""'re"", 'explained', 'just', 'once', 'need', 'need', 'only', '30', 'minute', 'routine', 'did', 'mention', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'long', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'plenty', 'time', 'available', 'disc', 'quick', 'optional', 'demonstration', 'moves', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'benefit', 'workout', ""'m"", 'standing', 'studying', 'how', 'do', 'moves', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'call', 'out', 'come', 'hither', 'expect', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'Finally', 'fine', 'want', 'throw', 'yoga', 'language', 'know', 'many', 'are', 'not', 'yoga-savvy', 'explanation', 'terms', 'are', 'using', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'educational', 'as', 'well', 'help', 'understand', 'why', 'move', 'helpful', 'what', 'explanation', 'terms', 'demonstration', 'moves', 'too', 'short', 'cardio', 'workout', 'However', 'what', 'did', 'do', 'was', 'fun', 'suppose', 'plenty', 'people', 'would', 'overlook', 'complaints', 'do', 'enough', 'times', 'finally', 'get', 'moves', 'even', 'demonstration', ""'re"", 'looking', 'good', 'cardio', 'think', 'are', 'better', 'DVDs', 'there']",N/A
950941,A3T2G352GLIEZZ,B000BVXQO0,"The Legend Of Megadon ""MEGAN""","[6, 12]","I think giving this 2 stars is kind because the instructor was very annoying. Gillian did not shut up. She made noises and said very lame things throughout the dvd. I was also dissappointed because I expected an intense dance routine. It was mild to say the least I did not break a sweat. The dance moves were more modern than cabert or burlesque. The workout was not that long either. But if you can stand listing to Gillian flap her gums for about 25 mintes this is a good warm up or for a light day. I am usually kind and postive in my reviews, but this one made me scream shut up at the tv a few times, my kids were also commenting on how annoying the isntructor was. This is my 1st YBB dvd and I am so disappointed after all the good thing's I heard. And this dvd is so cheesy with new age yoga yuppie spiel added in. I love yoga don't het me wrong but the yoga section did not leave me feeling calm, it left me with ringing ears from all of the squealing. This one was just very cheesy. If you want a good sweat from dancing try Zumba instead.

950942,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B000BVXQO0,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[4, 6]","I love the ""zen, in the moment, let's enjoy working out, enjoy your body"" feel of Teigh McDonough & Gillian Marloth. This is about the same easy pace, easy to mimic as their Light & Easy & Latin workouts.It's set like the picture with at least 6 other women & 1 in good shape guy all in their 20s or early 30s. Most of the women are in great shape or only a few extra pounds so that their excitement & enthusiasm is high & contagious. In the Easy or Latin workouts, the ones who were more then say 30 lbs overweight got tired & barely moved which put a damper on your own enthusiasm.It starts with only a tiny second of kundalini yoga (much too short), then it's all mostly cabaret dance. There is a woman in the row behind between Teigh & Gillian who looks to have dance school experience & since she doesn't have to teach like them, she seems to get into it the most with a lot of grace & makes the moves look more hip then they are. The moves are very simplified, cutsy, silly, only a few moves that would be considered sexy.I loved the end point of the small amount of ballet & end stretching. I hope they have workout with that emphasized.This is great for beginners/those who are out of shape & low endurance or those who are looking for something light, easy & fun. Doing this will make you feel more positive & even want to workout more!I hope Teigh & Gillian put out more of their Master series or more workout with ballet or balancing exercises.",4,"All easy dance moves, easy pace, tiny bit of balancing ballet moves",1185840000,"07 31, 2007",2007,1455,"['love', 'zen', 'moment', 'let', 'enjoy', 'working', 'out', 'enjoy', 'body', 'feel', 'Teigh', 'McDonough', 'Gillian', 'Marloth', 'same', 'easy', 'pace', 'easy', 'mimic', 'Light', 'Easy', 'Latin', 'workouts.It', 'set', 'picture', 'least', '6', 'other', 'women', '1', 'good', 'shape', 'guy', '20s', 'early', '30s', 'Most', 'women', 'are', 'great', 'shape', 'only', 'few', 'extra', 'pounds', 'so', 'excitement', 'enthusiasm', 'high', 'contagious', 'Easy', 'Latin', 'workouts', 'ones', 'who', 'were', 'more', 'then', 'say', '30', 'lbs', 'overweight', 'got', 'tired', 'barely', 'moved', 'put', 'damper', 'own', 'enthusiasm.It', 'only', 'tiny', 'second', 'kundalini', 'yoga', 'much', 'too', 'short', 'then', 'mostly', 'cabaret', 'dance', 'woman', 'row', 'Teigh', 'Gillian', 'who', 'have', 'dance', 'school', 'experience', ""n't"", 'have', 'teach', 'get', 'most', 'lot', 'grace', 'moves', 'look', 'more', 'hip', 'then', 'are', 'moves', 'are', 'very', 'simplified', 'cutsy', 'silly', 'only', 'few', 'moves', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'sexy.I', 'loved', 'end', 'point', 'small', 'amount', 'ballet', 'end', 'stretching', 'hope', 'have', 'workout', 'emphasized.This', 'great', 'beginners/those', 'who', 'are', 'shape', 'low', 'endurance', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'light', 'easy', 'fun', 'Doing', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'more', 'positive', 'even', 'want', 'workout', 'more', 'hope', 'Teigh', 'Gillian', 'put', 'out', 'more', 'Master', 'series', 'more', 'workout', 'ballet', 'balancing', 'exercises']",N/A
950943,AATP629AVSJJU,B000BVXQO0,Tymala,"[1, 1]","These girls are hilarious! When did you ever laugh and enjoy yourself during a workout? My friend and I have so much fun laughing with these girls and watching the guy in the back do the routine as well. Pure comedy! As for the workout, they are quite creative. I love the beginning with the drums and mantras; this actually attracted me to kundalini yoga in which I have also started doing. I wish they had more yoga tapes because they are kind of calming and soothing in the beginning with the combo of Ravi's drums. And then the cardio is an easy to follow dance routine that will also crack you up. Come on- don't we need a bit of cheesiness and laughs to motivate ourselves? The best issue is that I believe this series is perfect for beginners or in my case (injured in the shoulder). They do not do any moves that are taxing to the joints and the intensity is low enough for someone starting an aerobic program.As another viewer stated, you can do the cardio twice or increase your own intensity. I usually do the moves bouncing or with more high-impact moves. I have had to put my exercise regime on hold for several months due to my injury and now have to do more careful routines that will not complicate my shoulder that loves to dislocate. This routine delivers for me. I can do most of this without moving my bad arm and I do not have to bounce, but it still gives me some cardio. I am using this routine with yoga and other moderate or low key exercises to keep me in shape until after my upcoming surgery. The ballet is also great in the end to help do some toning. These girls are just so motivational and I think that this should be someone's first choice who needs to work up their fitness levels and get some motivation. Or for the more advanced exerciser who wants to have fun and turn the routine up a notch with higher intensity. Another reviewer does this routine with her daughter. I think this is a great idea for those who want to laugh and bond with their kids. I have enough fun doing this with my friend.
