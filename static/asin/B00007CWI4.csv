One likes to arrange dates in internet chatrooms; the other wants to get to know the other person first.  The former gets ""dates"" - in a back area of an adult theater and with an 18-year-old nominally straight guy who plays baseball; the latter pines away at home.  The roommates claim not to like each other.  An underutilized, cute friend of the reserved roommate shows him how to get on the internet.  Both roommates end up in the same chatroom.  Try guessing the rest.To its credit, this very earnest film flies through its motions in about 65 minutes.  Snickers help one get past the wooden script and acting lulls.  There are lots of skin shots, and the casting is attractive, though some of the sex scenes may not convince.  (Maybe the two interviews in the extras section help explain that - both actors say they are straight and have never done this sort of thing before.)While the movie clearly wants to show why getting to know someone before sex is better than a quickie through the internet, the roommate who holds back is not shown succeeding at getting much more than computer advice from a friend, who is told in turn that friendship is not enough to get any sex.  The payoff for the slow-going roommate seems no better than the web-shopper's.  It is not even clear the roommates will continue to tolerate each other.Worthy, but trite...",2,After-School Formula,1041465600,"01 2, 2003",2003,1408,"['Two', 'good-looking', 'gay', 'guys', 'are', 'roommates', 'Manhattan', 'One', 'arrange', 'dates', 'internet', 'chatrooms', 'other', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'person', 'first', 'former', 'dates', 'back', 'area', 'adult', 'theater', '18-year-old', 'nominally', 'straight', 'guy', 'who', 'baseball', 'latter', 'pines', 'away', 'home', 'roommates', 'claim', 'not', 'like', 'other', 'underutilized', 'cute', 'friend', 'reserved', 'roommate', 'how', 'get', 'internet', 'roommates', 'end', 'up', 'same', 'chatroom', 'Try', 'guessing', 'rest.To', 'credit', 'very', 'earnest', 'film', 'flies', 'motions', '65', 'minutes', 'Snickers', 'help', 'one', 'get', 'wooden', 'script', 'acting', 'lulls', 'are', 'lots', 'skin', 'shots', 'casting', 'attractive', 'sex', 'scenes', 'may', 'not', 'convince', 'Maybe', 'two', 'interviews', 'extras', 'section', 'help', 'explain', 'actors', 'say', 'are', 'straight', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'sort', 'thing', 'movie', 'clearly', 'show', 'why', 'getting', 'know', 'someone', 'sex', 'better', 'quickie', 'internet', 'roommate', 'who', 'back', 'not', 'shown', 'succeeding', 'getting', 'much', 'more', 'computer', 'advice', 'friend', 'who', 'told', 'turn', 'friendship', 'not', 'enough', 'get', 'sex', 'payoff', 'slow-going', 'roommate', 'better', 'web-shopper', 'not', 'even', 'clear', 'roommates', 'will', 'continue', 'tolerate', 'other.Worthy', 'trite']",Breaking The Cycle

726907,A2NT3FUNOPX8HP,B00007CWI4,RSMM,"[5, 7]","""Breaking the Cycle,"" is poor, simulated, soft-core gay male erotica shot on video (not film). It attempts to be a romantic comedy with the ""message"" that surfing the internet for casual sex is no way to find a long-term relationship, hardly an earth-shattering piece of information. The guys are pleasant-looking but the acting is laughable. 10% Productions uses straight actors playing gay; nothing unusual there, but interviews with two of them reveal that they were very uncomfortable doing so. It is obvious that no one received much coaching because the simulated erotic scenes are clumsy and the guys are apparently nervous even about being seen kissing; as a result, they look like they have never kissed anyone, male or female. Everything about their participation is a real turn-off. Irresponsibly, nowhere is there a hint of safe-sex practices. The two principals are supposed to be roommates who are actors having trouble finding work. That premise is the only candid aspect of this mess: who would hire such talentless hacks?
