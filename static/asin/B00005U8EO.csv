683553,A172FVEA83DHOP,B00005U8EO,Amazon Customer,"[15, 15]","Pryor was brilliant in this set. However, as other reviewers have pointed out, his audience seemed to be composed of the inhabitants of every podunk village in Louisiana, who saw attendance at his show as the crowning moment of their lives, and wanted to make sure Pryor and the rest of the world knew just how momentous it was by announcing it at the top of their lungs, never stopping their celebration long enough to actually listen to Pryor's routine. He had to contend with a constant barrage of drunken heckling but he still managed to weave spellbinding stories and make brilliant impromptu observations about everyday life. In fact, he frequently turned the boorish behavior of the audience to his advantage, and constructed several brilliant bits of business from their sometimes bizarre antics. Still, it was particularly sad to watch the contrast between the profundity of Pryor's depiction of a broken down junkie and the audience's complete incomprehension of what Pryor was revealing. All the same, Pryor manages to transcend his audience's limitations and create a world of characters and experiences that was fascinating, touching and hilarious. If you can manage to do the same, and overlook the audience and immerse yourself in Pryor's world, it will be well worth the effort.

Pryor's last concert film, and not one of his better ones. Some interesting moments though. Mudbone appears in one of his rare filmed skits (compare this with the ""Richard Pryor Show"" DVD which repeats the classic Mudbone performance from ""Is It Something I Said""). There is a really interesting moment when Pryor talks to a fiddler crab that crawls on his stool that is the kind of one-man theater that distiguished Pryor from his cursing copycats who had all of the profanity but none of the profundity of the master. He also does a frightfully accurate rendition of a junkie going on a nod. You can tell that he knows what he's talking about. In either case, this is for fans only.

683557,A29VIAU00NGBPM,B00005U8EO,"L. Peters ""MuscleHead""","[2, 2]","Richard Pryor Here and Now demonstrates that he's arguably the greatest stand-up comic of all time.  It's true that this concert is by far weaker than Live in Concert and Sunset Strip.  There are more slow spots here and the frequent interruptions and distractions by the obnoxious audience throw Pryor off of his rhythm.  Part of what makes this fascinating to watch is how Pryor handles these people and saves the film.  A lesser comedian would have been crushed.  Richard Pryor, even when not in top form and with so much working against him still manages to be very funny.  ""This ain't Johnny Carson MFs!!!""  Prudish people with an aversion for adult language and content, or uncomfortable with in-your-face discussions of race relations or the dark side of American history shouldn't watch this or any other Richard Pryor concert.",4,Still on fire,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,835,"['Richard', 'Pryor', 'Here', 'Now', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'stand-up', 'comic', 'time', 'true', 'concert', 'far', 'weaker', 'Live', 'Concert', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'are', 'more', 'slow', 'spots', 'here', 'frequent', 'interruptions', 'distractions', 'obnoxious', 'audience', 'throw', 'Pryor', 'rhythm', 'Part', 'what', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'how', 'Pryor', 'people', 'film', 'lesser', 'comedian', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'crushed', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'top', 'form', 'so', 'much', 'working', 'still', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Johnny', 'Carson', 'MFs', 'Prudish', 'people', 'aversion', 'adult', 'language', 'content', 'uncomfortable', 'in-your-face', 'discussions', 'race', 'relations', 'dark', 'side', 'American', 'history', 'should', ""n't"", 'watch', 'other', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'concert']",Richard Pryor Here and Now
683558,A4LZ4IDYG496U,B00005U8EO,Mo Lindsey,"[24, 25]","People say that HERE & NOW didn't make as big an impact as his other concert films , particularly LIVE ON SUNSET STRIP , but I found the film very enjoyable. The excited (maybe drunken) hecklers would sometimes interrupt Pryor's routine early in the film but he rolls with the hecklers garnering applause at times.The beauty of Pryor's stand-up is that he seems to share seriously revealing aspects of his personal life for the sake of comedy and entertainment. The moment when he is talking about the junkies are an example of that. The routine changes from stand-up to captivating theatre when he talks about the junkie ""Motif"". Pryor gets into character and when he begins to roll his sleeve up indicating he is about to 'shoot up' it goes from comedy to commentary. You clearly see the sad reality painted by him yet he doesn't go too far out of the comedic light to still make you laugh. He walks that fine line between funny and seriousness. That is part of the reason why Pryor is considered a comedy genius and I haven't seen another comedian do that better.The DVD is a two-sided disc with widescreen on one side and full screen on the other. The audio is digital mono with english and french subtitles (at least on the disc I own).People say that this isn't his best stand up routine but that doesn't mean it is bad stand up. Pryor has stand up routines that are tough to measure up to so it really isn't fair to belittle this film by comparing it to his other shows even though in HERE & NOW he is very much open , spontaneous , and connected with the audience. To me HERE & NOW is very funny enlightening , and revealing.",4,THIS FILM IS UNDERAPRRECIATED!
