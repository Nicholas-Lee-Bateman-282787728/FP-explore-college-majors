It does an excellent job of maintaining the tension, keeping you wondering what crazy thing is going to happen next. Definitely some horror movie stereotypes too, it even plays on them. For example, before entering the haunted building, the lead character says something along the lines of ""we are those stupid people"", a not too subtle comment on how you always want to say ""why do they do such dumb things?"" when you watch these type movies. Yes, they do plenty of dumb things, and yes, you can make a pretty good guess what is going to happen next in many of the scenes, but you are wrong enough that that tension stays with you.

Because that's exactly what you will do if you manage to sit through the whole thing. You will boo. You will hiss, and if you have any rotten vegetables lying around, you might even throw them at the television.'Twas a dark and stormy night... Four teens decide to go into a haunted asylum on Halloween. Gee, now that's original. Never seen that before. It's such a blatant plot contrivance that I think the director actually tried to make it seem more plausible by having the main character say, ""I guess we really are those people."" Didn't self-referencing horror movies go out with the SCREAM franchise? Apparently nobody notified the big brains behind this unspooky spectacle.Everybody gets trapped in the asylum and there's some kind of ghost thing that can possess you and make you see creepy stuff like dead dogs and evil clowns.Meanwhile, elsewhere in the asylum, there's some vigilante guy who's going around with a loaded gun, trying to find his missing sister. Anyone want to tell me why he decided to wait until Halloween night to undertake this mission? Vigilante-Boy manages to talk some kind of has-been actor turned cop to go along with him. So this actor/cop drives Vigilante-Boy to the asylum, but then refuses to go inside. He sits outside in the car and doesn't budge, even when he hears multiple gunshots coming from the interior. Some cop, this guy.So eventually, actor/cop goes in. He shoots some of the possessed teenagers and saves the day. The big bad ghost reveals himself as one of the former inmates of the asylum (big shock) and tries to possess one of the kids so he can escape.

931923,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B000ARFQ0C,Micheal Hunt,"[0, 0]","Lately I think I have been renting some of the all time worst b-grade horror movies known to man, not on purpose, it just seems the local Blockbuster really knows how to pick the ones with covers on them that grab your eye only to disappoint you completely by stealing away your money and 2 hours of your life you will never get back. (Hence, The Quick & The Undead)So, unless I've just been tuned down to seeing such drivel and this movie just seemed better then the others, then I can honestly say this is one of the better b-graders I've seen for a while.The story is really nothing original, in fact it's pretty much a combination of a whole bunch of things you probably have seen before. To give you a run down, it kind of starts off the way Scream did, then into a similar plot to House On Haunted Hill (the remake), Then into somewhat of a Gothika\Nightmare On Elm St (5, I think, mightve been 6) and then bit's of The Thing and Shocker.Tho I could easily say it just rips off other movies, it does blend them in well to make it it's own. I sort of just thought to myself, ""stop comparing this to House On Haunted Hill, and think of it as a spin off or sequel or something"" and that worked for me.Basic story is, Halloween night, college kids, or teens, who can tell these days? They go into a haunted shut down hospital, others get involved, turns out it really is haunted, they get locked in, and they cant get out (duh) but luckily one of the characters has visions and can figure out whats going on and what to do.But don't think I'm trying to say this movie is just like every other film cause it has the same plot seen a billion times.I thought for a film that was on a pretty low budget, they actually did a pretty good job. There was some crappy acting here and there, but when was the last time a horror movie has an actor nominated for best actor in a movie? So, those complaining about it, shut up already and live with it, it was far from the worst acting anyone has ever seen.The effects where pretty awesome, there should be enough for the gore lover fan of bits of cow intestines and rat guts poured against the wall. And they have done a good job not going overboard with CGI ghosts, and trying to do whatever they can in real time as possible.I think it's best to say that if you liked the 199something remake of House On Haunted Hill, then this one might interest you too. It's far from being as good as it, but it's a hell of a lot better then some $#!% like Slaughterhouse Massacre, there is no unneeded nudity in this film which makes it SO refreshing to see them not using cheap tactics to get teenage males attention to see this thing and make everyone else's eyes roll. Tho, for the pervs, there is a bra shot :O...big deal, get a job already.There is also some featurettes included, interviews with the cast and crew, make up effects and some stories about the actual hospital they shot the film in, the crew claiming what they have seen... which is there imagination fueled by fear, but eyy, this a review, not a scientific explanation.The only thing i think this film lacked was it needed a better ending, It could have been a lot better then what it was, and less confusing. But euhh, it's done now, printed and completed and when have you ever heard of a movie that had scenes re-done in later time? So, why indulge into it further, theres nothing we can do about it now.Overall, like I said, rent it if you liked House On Haunted Hill. &lt;ASIN: B00003CWRF>",3,"If you liked ""House On Haunted Hill"" you may like this film!",1194912000,"11 13, 2007",2007,3494,"['Lately', 'think', 'have', 'been', 'renting', 'time', 'worst', 'b-grade', 'horror', 'movies', 'known', 'man', 'not', 'purpose', 'just', 'local', 'Blockbuster', 'really', 'how', 'pick', 'ones', 'covers', 'eye', 'only', 'disappoint', 'completely', 'stealing', 'away', 'money', '2', 'hours', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'back', 'Hence', 'Quick', 'Undead', 'So', ""'ve"", 'just', 'been', 'tuned', 'down', 'seeing', 'such', 'drivel', 'movie', 'just', 'seemed', 'better', 'then', 'others', 'then', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'one', 'better', 'b-graders', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while.The', 'story', 'really', 'nothing', 'original', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'combination', 'whole', 'bunch', 'things', 'probably', 'have', 'seen', 'before', 'give', 'run', 'down', 'kind', 'starts', 'way', 'Scream', 'did', 'then', 'similar', 'plot', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'remake', 'Then', 'somewhat', 'Gothika\\Nightmare', 'Elm', 'St', '5', 'think', 'mightve', 'been', '6', 'then', 'bit', 'Thing', 'Shocker.Tho', 'could', 'easily', 'say', 'just', 'rips', 'off', 'other', 'movies', 'blend', 'well', 'make', 'own', 'sort', 'just', 'thought', 'myself', 'stop', 'comparing', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'think', 'spin', 'off', 'sequel', 'something', 'worked', 'me.Basic', 'story', 'Halloween', 'night', 'college', 'kids', 'teens', 'who', 'can', 'tell', 'days', 'go', 'haunted', 'shut', 'down', 'hospital', 'others', 'get', 'involved', 'out', 'really', 'haunted', 'get', 'locked', 'cant', 'get', 'out', 'duh', 'luckily', 'one', 'characters', 'visions', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'whats', 'going', 'what', 'do.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'trying', 'say', 'movie', 'just', 'like', 'other', 'film', 'cause', 'same', 'plot', 'seen', 'billion', 'times.I', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'low', 'budget', 'actually', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'was', 'crappy', 'acting', 'here', 'there', 'when', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'horror', 'movie', 'actor', 'nominated', 'best', 'actor', 'movie', 'So', 'complaining', 'shut', 'up', 'already', 'live', 'was', 'far', 'worst', 'acting', 'anyone', 'ever', 'seen.The', 'effects', 'where', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'gore', 'lover', 'fan', 'bits', 'cow', 'intestines', 'rat', 'guts', 'poured', 'wall', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'not', 'going', 'CGI', 'ghosts', 'trying', 'do', 'can', 'real', 'time', 'possible.I', 'think', 'best', 'say', 'liked', '199something', 'remake', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'then', 'one', 'might', 'interest', 'too', 'far', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'hell', 'lot', 'better', 'then', '%', 'Slaughterhouse', 'Massacre', 'unneeded', 'nudity', 'film', 'SO', 'refreshing', 'see', 'not', 'using', 'cheap', 'tactics', 'get', 'teenage', 'males', 'attention', 'see', 'thing', 'make', 'everyone', 'else', 'eyes', 'roll', 'Tho', 'pervs', 'bra', 'shot', 'O', 'big', 'deal', 'get', 'job', 'also', 'featurettes', 'included', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'make', 'up', 'effects', 'stories', 'actual', 'hospital', 'shot', 'film', 'crew', 'claiming', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'imagination', 'fueled', 'fear', 'eyy', 'review', 'not', 'scientific', 'explanation.The', 'only', 'thing', 'i', 'think', 'film', 'lacked', 'was', 'needed', 'better', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'what', 'was', 'less', 'confusing', 'euhh', 'done', 'now', 'printed', 'completed', 'when', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'movie', 'had', 'scenes', 're-done', 'later', 'time', 'So', 'why', 'indulge', 'further', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'now.Overall', 'said', 'rent', 'liked', 'House', 'Haunted', 'Hill', 'lt', 'ASIN', 'B00003CWRF', '>']",N/A

The film hits on the classic cliche scenes. I thought the beginning was ""Scarey Movie."" The best way to enter the hospital is from the funeral home. One kid is rigging the hospital to be scary for the other four. And there are other people looking for some missing girls they believe are in the hospital too.I thought the film was fairly decent, a good effort that held my interest for about the first hour. After that it repeated too much of the same formula. The script needed some middle relief. Take heed. There are some plot spoiler reviews that tell you why the place is haunted. Good blood splatter. It is a story of what happens when you use an non-certified elevator, because they always stop on the haunted floor.

As in most of these types of movies, some make it out alive and some don't. There is inventiveness in the manner of deaths, and also the destruction (albiet temporarily) of ghosts. The movie made me jump on several occasions and two friends I know who saw it loved it and another who had to stop around the 30 minute mark as she was getting too creeped out. There is a fair amount of blood and gore in the unrated version I saw, but no nudity.
