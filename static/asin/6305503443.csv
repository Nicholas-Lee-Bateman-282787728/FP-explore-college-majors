Good movie with great gymnastics, with a very young Keanu Reeves establishing that he would become a big star someday. This edition of the movie was watchable, too, an 8/10 on the viewing scale. Other DVDs and VHS tapes are so poorly transferred you can't sit through them - believe me, I bought all of them!",4,No visine needed.,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,400,"['Dream', 'Believe', 'sort', 'Flashdance', 'gymnastics', 'crowd', 'good', 'thing', 'Good', 'movie', 'great', 'gymnastics', 'very', 'young', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'establishing', 'would', 'become', 'big', 'star', 'someday', 'edition', 'movie', 'was', 'watchable', 'too', '8/10', 'viewing', 'scale', 'Other', 'DVDs', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'transferred', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'believe', 'bought']",Dream to Believe VHS

467615,A35JTKKSBNW100,6305503443,"Miss Hater ""Avid Reader""","[0, 0]","I got this movie because I'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves. It is always great to see him in anything but I didn't expect that much from the film. I was pleasantly surprised. I found myself really getting into the story and rooting for Robin in her struggle. When she did her final routine I was actually nervous, just hoping she'd make it. Keanu was great and very adorable as Robin's supportive boyfriend Tommy. Tommy and Robin made a cute couple and I enjoyed their love story. I also liked her relationship with her close friend ,played by Jessica Steen. I've heard people complaining this isn't a realistic gymnastics movie but I have no interest in gymnastics so I couldn't care less.

467617,AZ300ONBPTWBZ,6305503443,Pygar,"[0, 2]","I have seen 1.33:1 vhs releases, and 1.77:1 dvd from overseas.  I wonder what aspect ratio the dvd's really are listed here.  You can't trust amazon's info.Here is the rub.After compareing the vhs and wide dvd, I have determined the aspect ratio of the celuloid negative is about 1.66:1.  The wide dvd I have seen was cut on the top and bottom.  The vhs is not cut on the top and bottom, but is cut on the sides.  So neither is correct.Studio's are releasing most everything 1.77:1 (16x9) which is a compromize between 35mm and 70mm film.I would much rather they release things ""the extact size of the celuloid negative"" Period.  When high end dvd players first came out, there was a lot of choices for zooming. 1.2x, 1.4x etc.. This worked well for the odd sized dvd's like ""countess dracula"" which was 1.66:1.  Now they just crop everything to 1.77 no matter the size.This ruins films shot in 1.33:1 and 1.66:1.",3,Good Olivia movie. questionable dvd,1309651200,"07 3, 2011",2011,913,"['have', 'seen', '1.33:1', 'vhs', 'releases', '1.77:1', 'dvd', 'overseas', 'wonder', 'what', 'aspect', 'dvd', 'really', 'are', 'listed', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'trust', 'amazon', 'info.Here', 'rub.After', 'compareing', 'vhs', 'wide', 'dvd', 'have', 'determined', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'celuloid', 'negative', '1.66:1', 'wide', 'dvd', 'have', 'seen', 'was', 'cut', 'top', 'bottom', 'vhs', 'not', 'cut', 'top', 'bottom', 'cut', 'sides', 'correct.Studio', 'are', 'releasing', 'most', 'everything', '1.77:1', '16x9', 'compromize', '35mm', '70mm', 'film.I', 'would', 'much', 'rather', 'release', 'things', 'extact', 'size', 'celuloid', 'negative', 'Period', 'When', 'high', 'end', 'dvd', 'players', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'lot', 'choices', 'zooming', '1.2x', '1.4x', 'etc..', 'worked', 'well', 'odd', 'sized', 'dvd', 'countess', 'dracula', 'was', '1.66:1', 'Now', 'just', 'crop', 'everything', '1.77', 'matter', 'size.This', 'films', 'shot', '1.33:1', '1.66:1']",Dream to Believe VHS

467619,AF6MWBGDVB39Y,6305503443,The Whatever Dude,"[6, 7]","I only today, picked this up at the 99 cents only store today, and I still think I got ripped off. ""Dream to Believe"" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and $1 is just too freakin' expensive for this. This film is probably only notable for 2 things: 1. It has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. It's directed by Paul Lynch, the man who also did Promo Night. Now onto the movie.It's about a girl named Robin (Played by Olivia D'Abo) who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her father's life. So the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments, she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named Tommy (Played by Keanu.) Robin, when not in training, works part-time, along with her mother and stepsister, at a Laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather. Eventually she is chosen to compete.Overall, Keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star, and it's also not one of the worst movies ever, but still far from good. The DVD itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old VHS and towards the end, the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over, it fades to black, even though sound can still be heard. So this can probably be passed as a bootleg. The DVD artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of Keanu and Olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie, as it's also not in the movie itself, so the cover's obviously photoshopped. In any case, avoid at all costs, unless you're a Keanu fanatic. I probably won't be hanging to it any longer. I'm probably gonna give it to The Cinema Snob, who's a great YT critic btw. Hey, if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight, feel free to donate to him to keep his show running.",2,Possibly the nadir of Keanu's carreer...and he was just getting started.,1223424000,"10 8, 2008",2008,1870,"['only', 'today', 'picked', 'up', '99', 'cents', 'only', 'store', 'today', 'still', 'think', 'got', 'ripped', 'off', 'Dream', 'Believe', 'pretty', 'boring', 'unrealistic', 'gymnastics', 'drama', '1', 'just', 'too', 'freakin', 'expensive', 'film', 'probably', 'only', 'notable', '2', 'things', '1', 'young', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', '2', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Lynch', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'Promo', 'Night', 'Now', 'movie.It', 'girl', 'named', 'Robin', 'Played', 'Olivia', ""D'Abo"", 'who', 'badly', 'injured', 'car', 'accident', 'also', 'cost', 'father', 'life', 'accident', 'competing', 'gymnastic', 'tournaments', 'often', 'picked', 'classes', 'eventually', 'wild', 'kid', 'named', 'Tommy', 'Played', 'Keanu', 'Robin', 'when', 'not', 'training', 'part-time', 'mother', 'stepsister', 'Laundromat', 'owned', 'abusive', 'stepfather', 'Eventually', 'chosen', 'compete.Overall', 'Keanu', 'alone', 'catchy', '80s', 'tunes', 'are', 'what', 'giving', '1', 'star', 'also', 'not', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'ever', 'still', 'far', 'good', 'DVD', 'not', 'getting', 'medals', 'be', 'sourced', 'old', 'VHS', 'towards', 'end', 'sound', 'sync', 'when', 'end', 'credits', 'are', 'almost', 'black', 'even', 'sound', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'heard', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'passed', 'bootleg', 'DVD', 'artwork', 'sense', 'either', 'what', 'be', 'recent', 'photos', 'Keanu', 'Olivia', 'background', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'also', 'not', 'movie', 'so', 'cover', 'obviously', 'photoshopped', 'case', 'avoid', 'costs', ""'re"", 'Keanu', 'fanatic', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'hanging', 'longer', ""'m"", 'probably', 'gon', 'give', 'Cinema', 'Snob', 'who', 'great', 'YT', 'critic', 'btw', 'Hey', 'have', 'crappy', 'movies', 'longer', 'want', 'sight', 'feel', 'free', 'donate', 'keep', 'show', 'running']",Dream to Believe VHS
