This story delves into how the conflict between Rosa fighting with the NAACP affected her family. Although some may find it to be a borderline story about relationships, I liked the story for that exact reason. It gave me a different view of how to look at a political situation that can hinder the people around you (for example, job loss, physical danger, voting rights). The focus of the story was on how Rosa Parks grew up not being able to understand the tactics of Jim Crow laws. Because her mother was just as strong as she, and her husband was initially a fighter as well, even someone who was unfamiliar with her would understand how she became so politically active.Instead of creating the book in a documentary, it was entertaining, sometimes romantic, political, controversial, and informative all wrapped into one movie. Angela Bassett was a great choice to play Rosa Parks and I loved Peter Francis James as her husband, Raymond Parks. This was the first time I'd seen this actor in anything and it made me want to become more familiar with his projects.Overall, great job. A friend of mine said that too many parts were left out about how Rosa Parks dealt with poverty later on, and I would surely like to see another movie go into the next segment of her life. Had it been in this one, it might've dragged on, but I would've enjoyed seeing that in the extras. The extras were rather disappointing--things like timelines are something I can find in an African American dominated textbook (they tend to be more accurate than the biased books that the Board of Education enforces). I would've liked to have seen actual interviews with Rosa Parks or how the actors were affected by doing a movie on this icon.From the segments I got, it does make me want to move on and read more about her though.",5,Something to Share,1151971200,"07 4, 2006",2006,1887,"['history', 'bus', 'incident', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'story', 'how', 'conflict', 'Rosa', 'fighting', 'NAACP', 'affected', 'family', 'may', 'find', 'be', 'borderline', 'story', 'relationships', 'liked', 'story', 'exact', 'reason', 'gave', 'different', 'view', 'how', 'look', 'political', 'situation', 'can', 'hinder', 'people', 'example', 'job', 'loss', 'physical', 'danger', 'voting', 'rights', 'focus', 'story', 'was', 'how', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'grew', 'up', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'understand', 'tactics', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'laws', 'mother', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'strong', 'husband', 'was', 'initially', 'fighter', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'would', 'understand', 'how', 'became', 'so', 'politically', 'active.Instead', 'creating', 'book', 'documentary', 'was', 'entertaining', 'sometimes', 'romantic', 'political', 'controversial', 'informative', 'wrapped', 'one', 'movie', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'was', 'great', 'choice', 'play', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'loved', 'Peter', 'Francis', 'James', 'husband', 'Raymond', 'Parks', 'was', 'first', 'time', ""'d"", 'seen', 'actor', 'anything', 'made', 'want', 'become', 'more', 'familiar', 'projects.Overall', 'great', 'job', 'friend', 'mine', 'said', 'too', 'many', 'parts', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'how', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'dealt', 'poverty', 'later', 'would', 'surely', 'like', 'see', 'movie', 'go', 'next', 'segment', 'life', 'Had', 'been', 'one', 'might', ""'ve"", 'dragged', 'would', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'extras', 'extras', 'were', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'things', 'timelines', 'are', 'something', 'can', 'find', 'African', 'American', 'dominated', 'textbook', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'biased', 'books', 'Board', 'Education', 'enforces', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'actual', 'interviews', 'Rosa', 'Parks', 'how', 'actors', 'were', 'affected', 'doing', 'movie', 'icon.From', 'segments', 'got', 'make', 'want', 'move', 'read', 'more', 'though']",N/A
