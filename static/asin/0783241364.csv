70190,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0783241364,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","The answer is, no, she is not great. Not by a long shot. This movie doesn't work on any level. Bette Midler and Nathan Lane are two of the most over-the-top scenery chewers to ever hit the silver screen. In the right vehicle they would both be fabulous, but this wasn't it. Here the tone and mood are all wrong.It is the story of trashy best selling novelist Jacqueline Susann (Bette Midler) and her press agent/husband Irving Mansfield (Nathan Lane). He seems to be the one asking 'Isn't She Great,' but he never seems to hear that people are saying 'no she is not.' In spite or because of her lack of literary talent, she becomes a huge success. Cancer and an autistic child were personal burdens she had to bear. Why then is the tone so slap stick? It doesn't work. It is like Springtime for Hitler, but without the laughs. At one point Truman Capote is shown on TV saying Jacqueline Susann's novels aren't writing, they are just typing (he really said it about Jack Kerouac, but it would be better applied to Susann). Capote was a great writer, in spite of his flaws, and the movie about him won an Oscar for Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Capote was a much better movie than Isn't She Great.I thought the movie might be good, or else it would be so bad that it would be entertaining, like something Joe Eszterhas would do. It was not bad enough to be entertaining, it was just apalling watching Midler and Lane mugging, thinking they were doing so fantastic. The tagline is talent isn't everything. Unfortunately, lack of talent IS everything when it comes to Isn't She Great (what, no question mark?).The Rose(1979) .... Bette Midler was nominated for an Oscar for playing Mary Rose FosterFor the Boys(1991) .... Bette got another nomination for playing Dixie Leonard, but Martha Raye claimed it was a rip off of her life story, and threatened to sue.The Birdcage(1996) ....

70193,A3IKSXORTDGVH5,0783241364,Edmond Gauthier,"[3, 6]","Many reviewers are confused as to why this film had a competent cast yet ended up as such a stinker, but the answer seems rather obvious:The Casting Director of this bomb was an idiot.I've seen this kind of thing happen before, where certain talent is chosen to play certain roles, but then later on in the development process the Casting Director has a ""brain storm"" about how to make it ""better,"" as it were. Very rarely does this strategy ever work.It seems that this was why you had Stockard Channing (a Jackie double, no less!) on board in the first place, because she seems to have been first cast as Jackie. Take some of the blame off the CD by guessing that Midler's agent later demanded that his client play Jackie instead of her friend? Possible.But at any rate, the result was a dud, and the CD still should never have allowed it. (It could also be argued that Cleese and Pierce's parts may have been switched, but we need no further reason to call it a day on this one.)That's because the real mixup is that Channing would have played a much better Jackie, that's all. Heck, even fellow cast member Amanda Peet would've played a better Jackie!And as for Midler doing these lame bios, enough, already! She's already done a crappy Gypsy remake, playing Gypsy Rose Lee's mom, a crappy Janice Joplin ripoff (The Rose), a crappy Francis Langford USO gal thing (For The Boys).

Part of the problem is a story which can't decide whether to be funny or serious. You feel badly for Susann and her husband Irving Mansfield after their son Guy has to be institutionalized but that sympathy evaporates when they visit the hapless child only to perform their schtick in front of him. Bette Midler is padded and overly made-up to look like a fat yenta but she veers toward self-parody.

Jackie was a really pretty woman. Bette Midler can look fairly attractive but,let's face it, she was never a pretty woman.  And, she is much,much too manic.  Just chewing scenery right and left. Just horrible casting.  I figure Bette must have financed this movie herself.  And, while Nathan Lane is charming he doesn't convey Irving very well.  It is too much like a comedy instead of the story of her life.  Sure they throw in sad things but those parts clash with the comedy parts.  David Hyde Pierce, as always, steals every scene he is in.

Just so you know, they also said that Miss Channing would look the role?  Honestly, did they watch the same movie?This movie is hillarious.  A true gem in the motion picture category.  Bette Midler is absolutely hillarious as the awesomely witty, edgey, and modern autor of the all time pop culture novel, &quot;Valley of the Dolls.

The film is very light. John  Cleese's is very well cast as her eccentric publisher. My main  disappointment is that the film ends too early.

70203,ATZONTF6SUZEP,0783241364,Matthew Patton,"[6, 9]","The title comes from the phrase that Jacqueline Susann's husband, Irving Mansfield, uttered about his wife at every possible turn.  The story is based, rather vaguely, on an article by writer and editor Michael Korda titled ""Wasn't She Great?""  (His final assessment?  Not really, but she was certainly, er, colorful).  Korda had been Susann's editor for her second novel THE LOVE MACHINE, and an aghast-yet-fascinated witness to the publicity juggernaut that the writer and her husband launched to sell the book (much as they had for her previous effort, VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, only now they had a pink jet to cart them around).In short, there is material for an interesting movie here, but although the movie is a harmless time-passer, it's not something you have to see, either.  To begin with, the tense, angry Susann, the human equivalent of an overloaded watch spring, is played by a jolly and rather-too-zaftig Bette Midler (not too zaftig to be seen mind you, just to be playing a woman who seemed to live on booze, tobacco, and mood-altering prescription drugs).  The real Susann, who arrived in New York with a high-school diploma, a pot habit, a complicated relationship with her father, and a burning desire to Be Famous, spent most of her life chasing the fame at the cost of a happy and productive life; she did bit parts in plays, became a married, but faithless, nightclub showgirl, knocked around in television.  And by her late forties was at about the same place as she had been over 20 years earlier.  The anger and frustration of those years was apparently drained into her names-changed showbiz potboilers, full of unhappy, promiscuous people who hop from bed to bed when they aren't too stoned on pills and booze to walk in a straight line (mind you, I haven't actually read any of the books--the closest I've come is a spoofy review that Calvin Trillin did of one of the novels and sitting through the last half hour of the movie version of VALLEY, appropriately while stoned on pain-killers and nursing a broken ankle--as I remember, Sharon Tate was pretty and very touching and Patty Duke yelled a LOT).It's rather hard to reconcile such bile with this movie (written by Paul Rudnick) about a nice Jewish lady who writes a naughty little novel and helps everybody, including her up-tight WASP-y editor (David Hyde-Pierce) to overcome their sexual hangups, fitting all of this in between weeping over the fate of her autistic son and popping by Central Park to chat with God (Susann did have an autistic son and she did have the odd chat with the Deity, but if you want the lowdown of how they fit into her rather dark life story, better to check out Barbara Seaman's LOVELY ME, one of the best biographies I've ever read about a writer I have no interest in reading).  That lady, as I've mentioned before, is played very agreeably by Bette Midler, and Nathan Lane is just as affable playing her husband.  Hyde-Pierce is basically doing a re-mix of Niles Crane, but he is such an assured and appealing actor that you really don't care.  There are also amusing turns by Stockard Channing as an actress friend of Midler's and John Cleese as an eccentric publisher.

Most of the reviews say the acting is overdone...ok, I concede that.  But thats the way Miss Susann lived much of her life, and Bette Midler is really the only actress I know who can act pushy enough to pull this role off...and she does so in a great way.  The first point she really shows her stuff is in the game show scene where she really does a great job of telling off the ditzy dumb blond actress she has to sit with (although later in the film, she actually befriends her!) Her emotional conversations with God and visits with her autistic son bring out the more touching moments of the film.  Also, watch carefully the scene at the Waldorf...you'll catch a glimpse of Eugene Levy (the father in the movie American Pie) sitting at one of the guest tables!Why can't I give this film 5 stars?  Only because I thought some things were left out that could have added to the quality of the film...such as Susann's passionate involvement with Ethel Merman, and the time spent writing her other stories (this movie focuses exclusively on Valley of the Dolls and says little about her other works).

I mean BIG.But I can't really say that I am biased, because ANY film with her radiates such warmth, and energy, and this one is no different. This movie isn't very thought-provoking, but it is sincere,hilarious, but at the same time very, very fragile.All the costars did a solid job, but this is Bette's party, this is her movie. I won't give away the plot, but it's about a writer, Jackie Susan (she wrote 'Valley of the Dolls&quot;), in the 60's, and she is in every sense of the word a rockstar.Over the top,dramatic, in your face, flashy, but with lots of heart and soul.She keeps getting rejected, 'till she finally gets her chance at becoming what she aspires to be- a writer.

70210,A14HHOT9999Z22,0783241364,"Stephen M. Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[4, 7]","This film version of the lifestory of Jacqueline Susann is deplorable in every way. What were these people thinking of? And did this movie actually make into the theatres? Even as a fan of Midler and Susann, it was a completely disappointing experience, with Midler, whose standard schtick is wearing thin these days, playing little more than a parody of herself. If we hadn't already known it was supposed to be about Jacqueline Susann, it would never have become apparent, since Midler misses the mark entirely - beginning with her physical type. As a gifted and presumably self-respecting actress, Midler should have abandoned the project after watching the first rushes. What also should have become apparent from the first rushes, is that Stockard Channing, who seems to play a comglomerate of Susann's women friends, should have played Susann herself. She has the range and skill and look to pull it off - Midler's a great entertainer, but Channing is a far better actress. As Irving Mansfield, Susann's husband and agent, Nathan Lane is well on his way to become the male Bette Midler - a parody of himself, and as predictable as he can be. Lane is just lame in this. The script was a few funny exchanges, but in the hands of Midler and Nathan Lane's overacting, *any* script would get lost. It is much more of a fictionalized account of Susann's life - the episodes of spending time on the *Christina* with Ari and Jackie Onassis are completely fabricated - but it's all for naught anyway. As for the all-important costuming - it is a split decision. Technically many of the clothes were absolutely perfect - they just looked ridiculous on Midler. Jacqueline Susann was fastidious about her fashion appearance, such as it was, and many of the clothes seemed to be exact replicas of the originals. On Susann, the styles were garish and over-the-top, emphasizing her rock-hard desire to succeed at any cost. On Midler, the same clothes were ludicrous. I admire Midler for being unafraid to look ludicrous - it's been her calling card for decades - but the ugly reality is that Midler, who is gloriously Ruebenesque, needed to shed more than a few pounds to pull off Susann's look. The Truman Capote character, played by Sam Street, was fabulous - for his entire 30 seconds onscreen, and while the film's reference to the famous feud between Capote and Susann was briefly touched on, it is exactly the sort of incident of Susann's life that is completely obliterated by this fiasco. John Cleese is wasted as Susann's publisher, and Hyde-Pierce is his usual Niles-like anal-retentive self. The producers were right on the money a few times -- music by Burt Bacharach and sung by Dionne Warwick was an excellent choice, if only they had used ALL of Bacharach's Sixties style music instead of any of the dreary new stuff.

What attracted such talents as Bette Midler, Nathan Lane, and Stockard Channing to this ludicrous script by the usually competent Paul Rudnick?  What inspired director Andrew Bregman (""The Freshman"") to add this piece of fluff and nonsense to his resume?  It's no surprise that the film remained shelved for some time after its completion, and disappeared from screens soon after its release . . . sadly, it's not even bad enough to be funny. Allegedly a bio of trash novelist Jacqueline Susann of ""Valley of the Dolls"" infamy, ""Isn't She Great"" plods along from Susann's (Midler) first meeting with the man she eventually married, Irving Mansfield, (Lane, miscast as anyone's husband) until her death from cancer in 1974.  Midler is forced to spend several scenes conversing with a tree she imagines to be God; moments the couple spend with their autistic son seem to have been included simply to keep the audience from asking, ""Whatever happened to the kid?;"" Channing, as Susann's gal pal, periodically flits in and out looking terrific but with absolutely nothing to do. Reality simply doesn't exist here. The newlywed Mansfields are apparently struggling to make it - publicist Irving's biggest client is Perry Como's ex-brother-in-law, a juggler, no less, and the highlight of Jackie's acting career is a one-time appearance on the ""celebrity"" panel of a TV quiz show called ""What's My Job?,"" yet they live in the lap of luxury in a highrise, have breakfast delivered, and eat at Lindy's on a regular basis - long before ""Dolls"" hits the best-seller lists.  Rudnick's script promises drama, but never delivers - Mansfield's jealousy of his wife's success, for example, is suggested, but never developed.  No one in the cast makes any effort to rise above the weak material - they either sleepwalk or bulldoze their way through scenes, as if they were resigned to this being a lost cause.  Only one true moment is to be found in this disaster - during the premiere of the film version of ""Dolls,"" Susann turns to her husband and mutters, ""I HATE this movie!"" . . . so believably that Midler no doubt is describing this whole, sorry mess.",1,ISN'T THIS DREADFUL?,1099526400,"11 4, 2004",2004,2268,"['Truly', 'bad', 'movies', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'how', 'often', 'do', 'boast', 'credits', 'as', 'outstanding', 'found', 'Is', ""n't"", 'Great', 'What', 'attracted', 'such', 'talents', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'Nathan', 'Lane', 'Stockard', 'Channing', 'ludicrous', 'script', 'usually', 'competent', 'Paul', 'Rudnick', 'What', 'inspired', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Bregman', 'Freshman', 'add', 'piece', 'fluff', 'nonsense', 'resume', 'surprise', 'film', 'remained', 'shelved', 'time', 'completion', 'disappeared', 'screens', 'soon', 'release', 'sadly', 'not', 'even', 'bad', 'enough', 'be', 'funny', 'Allegedly', 'bio', 'trash', 'novelist', 'Jacqueline', 'Susann', 'Valley', 'Dolls', 'infamy', ""n't"", 'Great', 'plods', 'Susann', 'Midler', 'first', 'meeting', 'man', 'eventually', 'married', 'Irving', 'Mansfield', 'Lane', 'miscast', 'anyone', 'husband', 'death', 'cancer', '1974', 'Midler', 'forced', 'spend', 'several', 'scenes', 'conversing', 'tree', 'be', 'God', 'couple', 'spend', 'autistic', 'son', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'simply', 'keep', 'audience', 'asking', 'happened', 'kid', 'Channing', 'Susann', 'gal', 'pal', 'periodically', 'looking', 'terrific', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'Reality', 'simply', ""n't"", 'exist', 'here', 'newlywed', 'Mansfields', 'are', 'apparently', 'struggling', 'make', 'publicist', 'Irving', 'biggest', 'client', 'Perry', 'Como', 'ex-brother-in-law', 'juggler', 'less', 'highlight', 'Jackie', 'acting', 'career', 'one-time', 'appearance', 'celebrity', 'panel', 'TV', 'quiz', 'show', 'called', 'What', 'Job', 'yet', 'live', 'lap', 'luxury', 'highrise', 'have', 'breakfast', 'delivered', 'eat', 'Lindy', 'regular', 'basis', 'long', 'Dolls', 'best-seller', 'lists', 'Rudnick', 'script', 'drama', 'never', 'delivers', 'Mansfield', 'jealousy', 'wife', 'success', 'example', 'suggested', 'never', 'developed', 'one', 'cast', 'effort', 'rise', 'weak', 'material', 'sleepwalk', 'bulldoze', 'way', 'scenes', 'were', 'resigned', 'being', 'lost', 'cause', 'Only', 'one', 'true', 'moment', 'be', 'found', 'disaster', 'premiere', 'film', 'version', 'Dolls', 'Susann', 'husband', 'mutters', 'HATE', 'movie', 'so', 'believably', 'Midler', 'doubt', 'describing', 'whole', 'sorry', 'mess']",N/A
