1596981,A2VMT89TCSF105,B009INALQS,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[9, 16]","[This is not a review of this particular product (which neither me nor anybody else has seen - yet), but a general comment on the two first seasons of ""Finding Bigfoot"".]""Finding Bigfoot"" is a typical American TV show, somewhere in the twilight zone between documentary, reality TV and scripted entertainment. Somewhat surprisingly, given the ""unscientific"" subject matter, it's aired on Animal Planet. But then, we *are* tired of lions, wildebeests and Yellowstone wolves, aren't we?""Finding Bigfoot"" follows a research team of four people whose mission is to find Bigfoot (a.k.a. Sasquatch), an elusive ape or ape-man supposedly roaming the wilder parts of the United States. Mainstream science regards Bigfoot as a silly tall-tale or hoax, while Native Americans consider it to be a supernatural spirit-being. The Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO), to which the research team belongs, firmly believes that the Sasquatch is a real, flesh-and-blood creature unknown to science. Thus, the BFRO are ""cryptozoologists"".The team in ""Finding Bigfoot"" is led by BFRO's founder Matt Moneymaker. He is assisted by two true believers, Cliff Barackman and the inimitable Bobo. The fourth member is a house sceptic, Ranae Holland. All episodes are built around the same concept: the BFRO travels to some God-forsaken part of the United States or Canada, investigates possible Bigfoot footage, interviews local eye-witnesses and finally attempts to find a Sasquatch themselves, using various decidedly unorthodox research methods which would give a real zoologist the creeps. Each episode also contain Matt Moneymaker's wild speculations about Bigfoot's habits, Bobo's one-liners about ""this forest being soooo squatchy"" and Ranae's (failed) attempts to keep the other team-members down to earth.I admit that ""Finding Bigfoot"" is entertaining - if you have the right sense of humour. I mean, Bobo is quite the character! The most interesting part of each episode is the stories of the local eye-witnesses. In fact, it's a pity ""Finding Bigfoot"" doesn't feature more of these. Matt's and Bobo's speculations about Bigfoot's behaviour are also interesting, but perhaps for other reasons (see further below).The biggest problem with shows like this is, of course, that ""the show must go on"". Even when the evidence for Bigfoot is hopelessly thin, the team members simply *must* roam the local forests and pretend to see or hear something. Since the nocturnal expeditions tend to get somewhat dull after a couple of episodes, the team also have to come up with stranger and stranger ideas about how to lure the elusive creature closer. How about a live monkey in a cage, or a radio-controlled toy deer? Since Animal Planet has no plans to discontinue the show, I suppose this works - for the ratings.Personally, I think BFRO are out on a wild goose chase. I suppose it's *possible* that an unknown primate is lurking around somewhere in the Rockies (few things are absolutely impossible on this strange planet), but many eye-witness reports are biologically impossible or absurd. One honest eye-witness claims to have seen an adult Bigfoot in a tree. The house sceptic Ranae points out that the tree branches aren't large enough to hold a creature the size of a gorilla. Another witness has seen a 10 - 11 feet tall Bigfoot in broad daylight in a small patch of forest surrounded by open country - so how come nobody else saw it? Very often, the Sasquatches are drawn to human habitat, as if they wanted contact. They peek into windows, lurk around campfires, show up close to playgrounds or in the middle of Suburbia (sic). This is inconsistent with an elusive creature whose main chance of survival is to avoid human contact as much as possible. It's also curious that no ""squatch"" has ever been caught or killed if they so consistently leave the pristine wilderness. Note also that Bigfoot reports are coming in from all 50 states of the Union. These creatures are just as home on mountain tops in the Pacific Northwest as in the tropical swamps of Florida, and are even reported from Rhode Island (which is ""squatchy as hell"" according to Bobo).The elusive character of Bigfoot presumably also explains the BFRO's rather strange speculations about their habits. Moneymaker claims that Bigfoot can mimic the sounds of coyotes and wolves, thus in effect fooling anyone who wants to locate the creature. Bobo at one point says that Bigfoot can eat goose and ducks by diving underwater and pull them down by their legs! Is Bigfoot amphibious? This must be a stranger ape than the aberrant species known as ""Homo sapiens""...That being said, I'm nevertheless fascinated by Bigfoot sightings. (I'm also childishly fascinated by the antics of the BFRO researchers!) There is some suggestive physical evidence that something strange is really going on beyond the city limits, including the famous Patterson-Gimlin film. But above all, there seems to be a paranormal aspect to much of the Bigfoot phenomenon. Matt Moneymaker makes an interesting comment in the North Carolina episode. He claims that sasquatches are often seen around power lines, and speculates that they somehow use powerlines as their ""highways"" when moving up and down the country. Maybe. Or maybe there is a connection between paranormal phenomena and electricity... ;-)I'm not sure how to rate ""Finding Bigfoot"", but since these guys actually made me watch most episodes on Youtube, I suppose I have to give it four stars. Thanks for the Bigfootainment! However, I feel more ""fringey"" than the indefatigable explorers of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization...",4,Bigfootainment,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,5629,"['[', 'not', 'review',

1596984,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B009INALQS,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 5]","FINDING BIGFOOT is awfully scattered about on Amazon ~ so I'm doing a generic review for several of them.This has become one of my favorite shows. It does me no harm nor embarrasses me to compare the show to Cousteau's work or Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom with the equally great Marlin Perkins. Here, the explorers except one are amateurs. ""Bobo"" Fay, a man I know I recognize from TV or film from his work as a stuntman, is great comic relief and a Sasquatch believer extraordinaire.Matt Moneymaker, who may or may not have relatives in my hometown, is the self-proclaimed ""leader"" (the others lashed him over that mistake, since they consider themselves co-workers/equals). Ranae Holland, a lady I admire deeply, is the scientist (a field biologist who used to study birds, I think). The last good fellow is where I run into my usual trouble: I can't recall his name but I think it's Matt.Matt is the reticent fellow--talks the least but works just as hard. This team comprises the Bigfoot Field Research Organization (hope I got that right, I always reverse ""field"" and ""research"" but I am accustomed to the arrangement ""field research""). They go to particular places, meet with the witnesses town-meeting style, then get to investigating the three most credible witnesses.All of that is basically what the show is; however, I compare it to the other great shows of my youth because these folks are going out and doing the work those Old School greats also did for TV. One day, I know it will occur, they'll find and film a real Sasquatch. Some may disagree with me, but I believe Roger Patterson's 1967 film is the only authenticated and proved documentary of a real Sasquatch.In the first season, you may witness squabbles. That was unfortunate and I know the whole crew lashed out at their producer for showing that--they also nailed him for making them look stupid, which unfortunately he did. It seems they demanded a more honest, higher quality show.GOOD for them! If the story is true, my impression was they were ready to walk sometime after the 2nd season if things didn't change. For me, that is all I need to know I am seeing real explorers looking for a REAL animal. That's right, I said ""real"". The Sasquatch is real--but I often wonder if my generation will ever see another aside from Patterson's Bigfoot (who is nicknamed ""Patty"").Get this and just enjoy the relaxing pleasure of watching field workers who are not afraid of anything. The creepy locations where they find themselves often startles me, and watching Bobo, who is around 6'6"" and I will not hazard a guess as to his weight, running around in the wilderness...to use his expression, that is as ""squatchy"" as you can get.PERSONAL NOTES: I have given kudos to Matt Moneymaker for speaking out against David Paulides, and if you read my reviews of Paulides' books you'll know why:Missing 411-Western United States & Canada: Unexplained Disappearances of North Americans that have never been solvedandMissing 411- Eastern United States: Unexplained disappearances of North Americans that have never been solved.However, my big hero is Ranae Holland, an out-and-proud lesbian who clearly misses her deceased father. She always speaks of watching Bigfoot shows with him on TV--and he seems to have been a believer. That is touching, and I admire Holland greatly.UPDATE OF AWESOMENESS: Yes, I wrote awesomeness and I meant it. At the start of FINDING BIGFOOT's 4th season, a new special was aired that explored the cast members. It made my day to learn about them all, and I'm sharing it with you:MATT MONEYMAKER as it turns out is a lawyer. Well, at least he graduated from law school and that made me admire him so much more--and it explains his manner of speaking plus his bossy attitude. What I loved about Matt, the only married cast member, is his wife is an M.D. and surgeon!CLIFF BARACKMAN gained much more respect in my estimation when I learned he produces fun DVDs about his own personal, off-show Bigfoot expeditions. They are hilarious and I think Animal Planet ought to share them. Cliff also holds a degree in jazz music and is a fine musician.BOBO FAY happens to be something of a chef, and in his heyday was a hell of a surfer. It saddened me to learn that his back is causing such trouble that he requires surgery.RANAE HOLLAND, about whom I learned nothing more than she seems more antisocial than I first assumed, apparently does love meeting and talking with people. Yet she avoided allowing the cameras into her Seattle home (the others welcomed the cameras in). As usual, though, Ranae managed to somehow say little yet make it all about how fantastic her physique is....But I know better than to simply 'judge a book by its cover'!",5,"This is the 21st

I also watch live every Sunday night when it comes on Animal Planet TV. Yes, I make popcorn and proceed to sit through Matt, Bobo, Ranae and Cliff as they eagerly anticipate finding some evidence of this elusive creature. It is very informative too! I especially appreciate the hard lab evidence that they encounter as in the recent episode where the team took some hair fibers that were given to them, to a lab for DNA processing. It is fun to watch and entertaining to say the least. Bobo makes the best squatch call because it is the deepest and strongest sounding. IMHO...
