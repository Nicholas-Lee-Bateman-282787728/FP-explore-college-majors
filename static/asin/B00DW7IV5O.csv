1662152,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00DW7IV5O,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[17, 17]","Somewhere in Illinois there is a 30-year-old tradition (give or take a few years). It revolves around two childhood best friends Kat and Samwise (yes, named after the hobbit). The tradition began in 1984 when they were four years old and their dads brought over a children's dinner table. From then on, Kat and Sam shared Christmas Eve at the children's table. We're presented with a plot conceit in which we watch our two leads' lives intersect for only one night a year (""Like Brigadoon,"" to quote Kat). And that night is always Christmas Eve. It's told mostly in episodic flashbacks and bookended by a present-day storyline in which Sam returns home after five years away.Maybe the huge frustration about this movie is why the long wait? Why did it take 30 years (give or take) for these two obvious soul mates to get together? The glib answer, of course, is that then there'd be no movie. ""Contrive, writers, contrive!!"" must've urged them studio producers. Maybe you should watch this during the holidays. Then you'd be more forgiving about the manipulative, string-it-out plot. Danica McKellar (""Kat Patton"") and Dustin Mulligan (""Sam Reid"") easily win you over. Dustin is effortlessly charming. Aspiring great romancers should take note of the things Dustin's character does in his time with Kat. Danica McKellar, well, it's Danica McKellar. She's sweet and lovely and can act with fine drama or be engagingly playful. Should I even mention that she's a math whiz in real life? She and Dustin sparkle in the small moments and in the big emotional moments.I love that there are literary references. There's one in particular, drawn from Dickens' Great Expectations, that applies to Lea Thompson's character. I gaze at Lea Thompson and feel the age in my bones. Wasn't too long ago, seems like, when I was mooning over her inSome Kind of Wonderful (Special Collector's Edition)and, yes, I'm not ashamed,Howard the Duck. Here, she has a stand-out scene in which she consoles a devastated Kat and gives her some good advice. However, my favorite reference has to do with a grown-up Sam's asking a bunch of children gathered around the table this all-important question: ""What is best in life?"" If you know the proper response to that, then you, dear reader, are my brother forever more. Or sister. Whichever. The ""Best Life"" game is something that Kat and Sam have played all their lives.This is a Lifetime movie, but hold up, it's one of the good Lifetime movies, despite the hiccups. Okay, one thing that had me raising an eyebrow was the intense argument between Kat and Sam that came out of nowhere and took a crushingly ugly turn. Also I question that these two, being such fast friends, wouldn't actually know more details about each other's job. And I never did get why each Christmas Eve is spent at Lea Thompson's house. But you know what? Ultimately I didn't care about the nitpicks. The two leads strike up such good chemistry and their Christmas Eve interludes are so much fun to watch that I was won over pretty much from jump. The best scene - in a film full of wonderful scenes - has to be the Kat & Sam dance. That scene alone puts a lid on a heap of plot holes.",4,(Belated) Love at the Christmas Table,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,3181,"['Somewhere', 'Illinois', '30-year-old', 'tradition', 'give', 'take', 'few', 'years', 'around', 'two', 'childhood', 'best', 'friends', 'Kat', 'Samwise', 'yes', 'named', 'hobbit', 'tradition', 'began', '1984', 'when', 'were', 'four', 'years', 'old', 'dads', 'brought', 'over', 'children', 'dinner', 'table', 'then', 'Kat', 'Sam', 'shared', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'children', 'table', ""'re"", 'presented', 'plot', 'conceit', 'watch', 'two', 'leads', 'lives', 'intersect', 'only', 'one', 'night', 'year', 'Brigadoon', 'quote', 'Kat', 'night', 'always', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'told', 'mostly', 'episodic', 'flashbacks', 'bookended', 'present-day', 'storyline', 'Sam', 'home', 'five', 'years', 'away.Maybe', 'huge', 'frustration', 'movie', 'why', 'long', 'wait', 'Why', 'did', 'take', '30', 'years', 'give', 'take', 'two', 'obvious', 'soul', 'mates', 'get', 'together', 'glib', 'answer', 'course', 'then', ""'d"", 'be', 'movie', 'Contrive', 'writers', 'contrive', 'must', ""'ve"", 'urged', 'studio', 'producers', 'Maybe', 'should', 'watch', 'holidays', 'Then', ""'d"", 'be', 'more', 'forgiving', 'manipulative', 'string-it-out', 'plot', 'Danica', 'McKellar', 'Kat', 'Patton', 'Dustin', 'Mulligan', 'Sam', 'Reid', 'easily', 'win', 'Dustin', 'effortlessly', 'charming', 'Aspiring', 'great', 'romancers', 'should', 'take', 'note', 'things', 'Dustin', 'character', 'time', 'Kat', 'Danica', 'McKellar', 'well', 'Danica', 'McKellar', 'sweet', 'lovely', 'can', 'act', 'fine', 'drama', 'be', 'engagingly', 'playful', 'Should', 'even', 'mention', 'math', 'whiz', 'real', 'life', 'Dustin', 'sparkle', 'small', 'moments', 'big', 'emotional', 'moments.I', 'love', 'are', 'literary', 'references', 'one', 'particular', 'drawn', 'Dickens', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'character', 'gaze', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'feel', 'age', 'bones', 'Was', ""n't"", 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'mooning', 'inSome', 'Kind', 'Wonderful', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'yes', ""'m"", 'not', 'ashamed', 'Howard', 'Duck', 'Here', 'stand-out', 'scene', 'devastated', 'Kat', 'good', 'advice', 'However', 'favorite', 'reference', 'do', 'grown-up', 'Sam', 'asking', 'bunch', 'children', 'gathered', 'table', 'all-important', 'question', 'What', 'best', 'life', 'know', 'proper', 'response', 'then', 'dear', 'reader', 'are', 'brother', 'forever', 'more', 'sister', 'Best', 'Life', 'game', 'something', 'Kat', 'Sam', 'have', 'played', 'lives.This', 'Lifetime', 'movie', 'hold', 'up', 'one', 'good', 'Lifetime', 'movies', 'hiccups', 'Okay', 'one', 'thing', 'had', 'raising', 'eyebrow', 'was', 'intense', 'argument', 'Kat', 'Sam', 'came', 'nowhere', 'took', 'crushingly', 'ugly', 'turn', 'Also', 'question', 'two', 'being', 'such', 'fast', 'friends', 'would', ""n't"", 'actually', 'know', 'more', 'details', 'other', 'job', 'never', 'did', 'get', 'why', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'spent', 'Lea', 'Thompson', 'house', 'know', 'what', 'Ultimately', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'nitpicks', 'two', 'leads', 'strike', 'up', 'such', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'interludes', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'was', 'won', 'pretty', 'much', 'jump', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'full', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'be', 'Kat', 'Sam', 'dance', 'scene', 'alone', 'lid', 'heap', 'plot', 'holes']",Love at the Christmas Table
