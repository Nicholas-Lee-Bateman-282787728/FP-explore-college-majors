723585,A1SWMOHC2S4HB5,B00006SFMG,"Raina Singh ""Mmmarshmallow""","[24, 25]","Now, I'm not really bothered that this DVD isn't traditional Yoga; especially since I was a big fan of Denise's other Yoga DVD, 'Fat Blasting Yoga', but most of the workout on this DVD is a carbon copy from Fat Blasting Yoga, so I can't help but feel a bit cheated.Also, I'm not totally convinced that this workout targets the lower body as it claims to.  It does a good job of stretching out the body, though intense lower body blast?  Hmmmm, I don't think so.So if its not Yoga, and its not a lower body toning workout... then what is it?What I reckon would be an accurate description of this DVD is an all-over stretching workout, with an infusion of pilates, ballet and mild (thats MILD, don't expect Billy Blanks here) cardio.  I have found that it does get the heart rate up, but I wouldn't recommend it as a sole source of cardio.  Call it a 'Jack of All Trades' workout, it does a bit of everything, but nothing is a speciality.All in all, I think this workout is good... but not for the reasons that its advertised for.  For those of you that complain about Denise Austin's personality, then for goodness sake, DON'T buy her DVDs!  She will not transform her personality for the production of any single DVD, and there is no exception in this DVD.  She is her usual bright, bubbly self (though some of you will say hyper, annoying, ditzy, etc etc) - and this doesn't bother me, since I am able to look past the instructor and do a workout based on its merits (if you REALLY can't stand her voice but like her workouts, put the darn TV on mute!).I'm glad I got this DVD, and will make great use of it, since even though I don't think it does what its advertised to do, there are benefits from the workout that I'll gladly receive regardless.  I'm not bothered that its not meditive, not well instructed, and not really Yoga.  If it makes me stop spending time writing reviews on Amazon to get up and exercise, its gotta be good for me in some way!",3,Errr... not Yoga... and not for the Buns?,1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,1955,"['Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'bothered', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'traditional', 'Yoga', 'especially', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'Denise', 'other', 'Yoga', 'DVD', ""'Fat"", 'Blasting', 'Yoga', 'most', 'workout', 'DVD', 'carbon', 'copy', 'Fat', 'Blasting', 'Yoga', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'bit', 'cheated.Also', ""'m"", 'not', 'totally', 'convinced', 'workout', 'lower', 'body', 'good', 'job', 'stretching', 'out', 'body', 'intense', 'lower', 'body', 'blast', 'Hmmmm', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.So', 'not', 'Yoga', 'not', 'lower', 'body', 'toning', 'workout', 'then', 'what', 'What', 'reckon', 'would', 'be', 'accurate', 'description', 'DVD', 'all-over', 'stretching', 'workout', 'infusion', 'pilates', 'ballet', 'mild', 'thats', 'MILD', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'here', 'cardio', 'have', 'found', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'sole', 'source', 'cardio', 'Call', ""'Jack"", 'All', 'Trades', 'workout', 'bit', 'everything', 'nothing', 'speciality.All', 'think', 'workout', 'good', 'not', 'reasons', 'advertised', 'complain', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'personality', 'then', 'goodness', 'sake', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'buy', 'DVDs', 'will', 'not', 'transform', 'personality', 'production', 'single', 'DVD', 'exception', 'DVD', 'usual', 'bright', 'bubbly', 'self', 'will', 'say', 'hyper', 'annoying', 'ditzy', 'etc', 'etc', ""n't"", 'bother', 'am', 'able', 'look', 'instructor', 'do', 'workout', 'based', 'merits', 'REALLY', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'voice', 'workouts', 'put', 'darn', 'TV', 'mute', '.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'got', 'DVD', 'will', 'make', 'great', 'use', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'what', 'advertised', 'do', 'are', 'benefits', 'workout', ""'ll"", 'gladly', 'receive', 'regardless', ""'m"", 'not', 'bothered', 'not', 'meditive', 'not', 'well', 'instructed', 'not', 'really', 'Yoga', 'stop', 'spending', 'time', 'writing', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'get', 'up', 'exercise', 'got', 'ta', 'be', 'good', 'way']",N/A
723586,A3O930D1JAQEKV,B00006SFMG,ReaderInChicago,"[16, 17]","I never would have purchased this DVD if I had read the other reviews, so I am glad I didn't because this workout kicked my butt!Contrary to what some of the other reviewers say, there is a LOT of yoga in this DVD.  It is NOT a traditional yoga video, true...and there is NO yoga instruction.  If you have never done yoga before, make sure to get an instructional video FIRST or you will not be able to follow along.  You might also consider getting one by Denise Austin (who I agree can be very annoying) because some of the names she uses for the poses are not consistant with traditional yoga you'll find on typical yoga videos.Again, contrary to some other reviewers, I found that it worked my lower body considerably.  Sure... not as much as machines at the gym, but for a yoga tape ... YES!  I could see how someone who didn't put forth much effort might think that it doesn't, but if you keep your butt contracted throughout (and she reminds you on a regular basis) you WILL feel the burn.  You might not want to use this DVD as your sole workout, but it is definitely one I will use as an integral part of my overall weekly routine.Finally, Denise Austin has some weird quirks that some other reviewers have noted.  Her eyes DO look possessed! And she has this bizarre way of talking that can be quite annoying.  However, I liked the workout SO much that I was able to look beyond her weirdness and get the most out of this DVD.I gave this DVD 5 stars despite some of the negative things I have stated because I think a lot of the lower star reviews were grossly unfair.  I'm glad for the impulse purchase I made at the store.  I'll be using this several times a week as part of my overall exercise program.",5,glad I didn't read other reviews before purchasing,1134432000,"12 13, 2005",2005,1715,"['never', 'would', 'have', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'had', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'am', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'workout', 'kicked', 'butt', 'Contrary', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'LOT', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'NOT', 'traditional', 'yoga', 'video', 'true', 'NO', 'yoga', 'instruction', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'yoga', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'instructional', 'video', 'FIRST', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'along', 'might', 'also', 'consider', 'getting', 'one', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'who', 'agree', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'annoying', 'names', 'poses', 'are', 'not', 'consistant', 'traditional', 'yoga', ""'ll"", 'find', 'typical', 'yoga', 'videos.Again', 'contrary', 'other', 'reviewers', 'found', 'worked', 'lower', 'body', 'considerably', 'Sure', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'machines', 'gym', 'yoga', 'tape', 'YES', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'someone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'forth', 'much', 'effort', 'might', 'think', ""n't"", 'keep', 'butt', 'contracted', 'regular', 'basis', 'WILL', 'feel', 'burn', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'use', 'DVD', 'sole', 'workout', 'definitely', 'one', 'will', 'use', 'integral', 'part', 'overall', 'weekly', 'routine.Finally', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'weird', 'quirks', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'eyes', 'DO', 'look', 'possessed', 'bizarre', 'way', 'talking', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'annoying', 'However', 'liked', 'workout', 'SO', 'much', 'was', 'able', 'look', 'weirdness', 'get', 'most', 'DVD.I', 'gave', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'negative', 'things', 'have', 'stated', 'think', 'lot', 'lower', 'star', 'reviews', 'were', 'grossly', 'unfair', ""'m"", 'glad', 'impulse', 'purchase', 'made', 'store', ""'ll"", 'be', 'using', 'several', 'times', 'week', 'part', 'overall', 'exercise', 'program']",N/A
723587,A1A9TE0NBFFYI,B00006SFMG,Teresa Moon,"[1, 2]",I bought this tape about 9 months ago. I had been doing Yoga and Pilates for about 2 years using Denise Austin videos and dvds.  This summer I joined a national gym and did Yoga and Pilates several times a week. Her tapes prepared me well for my hour long Yoga and Pilates clases.  I discontinued my gym membership 6 months later due to cost and feel very confident that I will continue my level of exercise using her tapes and DVDs. This tape has many of the Yoga exercises that we were doing in class. I do not feel this tape is best used by a person new to Yoga due to the pace.This tape is only 30 minutes long so the pace is pretty fast.I feel this tape is better used by someone who has been Yoga for a period of time.

Some of the poses are held literally for a few seconds.  Considerable flexibility and balance are required.  The cueing is not well done, leaving me rushing to catch up.  I found that the two girls working out with Denise looked much more natural in the yoga poses than Denise herself.I will probably keep doing this workout from time to time, just to add some variety to my workouts.

If I had to hear one more ditzy phrase about my buns (""C'mon! Tight tushies here!""), I would have...well, you get the idea. Denise Austin teaching yoga is just too weird and I couldn't take her seriously. She never mentions how to breath properly (essential to yoga), let alone when. If you're a regular yoga practioner, be advised that all of these moves are found in your regular practice.Basically, I really disliked this dvd. However, I gave it 2 stars because if you're into aerobics and pilates, you'd probably really like it and get a good workout.Someone mentioned that they didn't like the ""new age way"" that yoga was presented.

I highly recommend this product, though not as a core workout for your exercise regimen. Many people disregard stretching, but it is a very vital part of a good workout: it tones, even if you don't feel a burn, and it helps your muscles to be more flexible and discourages cramping. If you do keep your bum muscles clamped, the burn and the results are near immediate. Toning is also provided for the upper-body, abs, and especially the thighs. I become easily bored with workouts, and have to change things up to keep myself interested, and this product is a nice change to most typical pilates and yoga lower body workouts.
