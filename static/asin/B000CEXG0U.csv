958216,A15E01890A5IX5,B000CEXG0U,Alison Leigh,"[3, 4]","The BBC's 2005 remake of Charles Dickens's Bleak House leaves little to be desired. There is a wonderful cast, featuring great talents such as Charles Dance, Gillian Anderson, and newcomer Anna Maxwell Martin, who all put in fantastic performances. Even better, the script is written by the ultimate BBC dramatizer, the incomparable Andrew Davies.Bleak House is both a Victorian drama and murder mystery, centering on the Court of Chancery's Jarndyce & Jarndyce, a settlement case which has garnered and ultimately crushed dreams and expectations through its long and trying duration. In the mean time its proceeds are being steadily dried up by both court costs and greedy lawyers. The movie also tells the story of Lady Dedlock, an aristocratic beauty, whose secret past threatens to destroy an entire family legacy.Bleak House is wonderfully entertaining and I highly recommend it to everyone who likes period pieces and murder mysteries. It is a bit on the dark side, but it contains a wonderful script, sets, costumes, and acting.",5,Another spectacular offering from the BBC,1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,1035,"['BBC', '2005', 'remake', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Bleak', 'House', 'little', 'be', 'desired', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'featuring', 'great', 'talents', 'such', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'newcomer', 'Anna', 'Maxwell', 'Martin', 'who', 'put', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'Even', 'better', 'script', 'written', 'ultimate', 'BBC', 'dramatizer', 'incomparable', 'Andrew', 'Davies.Bleak', 'House', 'Victorian', 'drama', 'murder', 'mystery', 'centering', 'Court', 'Chancery', 'Jarndyce', 'Jarndyce', 'settlement', 'case', 'garnered', 'ultimately', 'crushed', 'dreams', 'expectations', 'long', 'trying', 'duration', 'mean', 'time', 'proceeds', 'are', 'being', 'steadily', 'dried', 'up', 'court', 'costs', 'greedy', 'lawyers', 'movie', 'also', 'story', 'Lady', 'Dedlock', 'aristocratic', 'beauty', 'secret', 'past', 'threatens', 'destroy', 'entire', 'family', 'legacy.Bleak', 'House', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'highly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'who', 'period', 'pieces', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'bit', 'dark', 'side', 'wonderful', 'script', 'sets', 'costumes', 'acting']",N/A

This is right up there with Pride & Prejudice and North & South.  I watched a little bit each night and every day at work, I was happy at the prospect of coming home to have the treat of watching another segment of the movie (I watched it on Masterpiece Theatre via my DVR but am buying it since it's a ""keeper"").  It's a great mix of a little bit of everything.  Some scenes show the dirty side of Victorian-era London, some are dark and ""Gothic-like"", the daytime outdoor scenes in the country are light and airy ""eye candy"" - these ones remind me of some Jane Austen movies (P&P, Sense & Sensibility, Emma).  The central theme of the movie revolves around a lawsuit and a mystery.  I don't want to spoil it and it looks like enough is said on the subject anyway with all of the other reviews here.  For me, the best part about this mini-series was the assortment of oddball supporting characters who were perfectly cast - the nerdy, ambitious and awkward ""Mr. Guppy"" and my favorite - the irritable, cantankerous, miserable, ""Mr. Smallweed"".  He can't walk but instead of using a wheelchair, he gets carried about in a chair, cursing and whipping the person carrying him and then constantly asks his granddaughter to ""shake him up"" because his bones are aching and settling.  So Judy shakes him and you hear these crunching noises, like when you're being adjusted at the chiropractor - it is simply HILARIOUS!  I loved everything about this movie.  The movie started out a bit slow when ""explaining"" the Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce case but it was necessary to the plot.  After that though, it was all very fast-paced, never boring.

958225,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B000CEXG0U,Andrew Raker,"[2, 2]","I really enjoyed watching this film. I thought both the acting and scriptwriting were marvelous. If I wrote the script,  I do not believe I could have written a better one  than Andrew Davies'.Now, many people have written positive reviews explaining why they found this adaptation very entertaining or otherwise worthy of 5 starts. Therefore, I do not want to repeat.Instead, I will point out a few characteristics/particulars that stood out to me in this adaptation:Positive characteristics:1.This adaptation really narrates Dickens' massive novel well. In other words, it is really difficult for a film adaptation to effectively show how the many subplots (and characters) interact. This film is brilliant in showing the interaction.2.The acting  was wonderful in this film. While I think the 1985 adaptation was very intelligent and contained above-average acting, the acting in this 2005 adaptation was even better. (I think this is especially true with Gillian Anderson in comparison to Diana Rigg.)3.This adaptation is very thorough. Many minor characters are included, which are entirely left out in the 1985 adaptation. Additionally, more screen-time is given to minor actors like Mr. Guppy and Inspector Bucket.4.This adaptation does not spend nearly as much time showing Inspector Buckett searching for Lady Dedlock after her secret was exposed. (I always found that part of the 1985 adaptation to be boring.)5.This adaptation really reminded me of Andrew Davies' adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. While this may appear irrelevant, I think it is worth noting that action in this 2005 adaptation is generally ENACTED/SHOWN rather than TOLD. Also, like in Pride & Prejudice, the major houses seem to appear (in Bleak House with music/noise)  at the beginning of nearly every locality shift.Negative characteristics:1.The 2005 adaptation did not show the poverty of the lower classes as effectively and prolongedly as the 1985 adaptation (for example: fog and pollution - present in every city scene in the 1985 adaptation - are not shown in this adaptation). While I am not criticizing this, I think it is a detail worth noting.2.The court scenes in this 2005 adaptation were not as prolonged or interesting (from the standpoint of criticism of Chancery and lawyers) as the 1985 adaptation. [However, I disagree with the two reviewers who gave this adaptation 1 star because of this one detail.]Neutral characteristics:1.The mood of the 2005 adaptation is simply not as ""bleak"" as the mood in the 1985 adaptation. In other words, the 1985 adaptation appears  to do a better job criticizing the culture and legal system of Britain, where the 2005 adaptation focus more on characters and plot - making certain the plot and subplots are well-explored.2.The 2005 adaptation is very easy to follow. Some might call it slightly boring because it is so predictable for those who have read the novel. In contrast, the 1985 adaptation is sequenced more like a film adaptation of a mystery novel with its fog, mist, poverty, and overall eccentric Dicksonian characters. Part of this is because the 1985 adaptation does not show the character interactions and subplots as well as the 2005 adaptation. However, I think the 1985 adaptation did strive to maintain some suspense under the pretext of a mystery.In conclusion, I think both adaptation are very interesting. However, in my opinion, the 2005 adaptation is better than the 1985, especially from a plot accuracy standpoint.",5,Very Enjoyable Film Series,1250726400,"08 20, 2009",2009,3478,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'thought', 'acting', 'scriptwriting', 'were', 'marvelous', 'wrote', 'script', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'better', 'one', 'Andrew', ""Davies'.Now"", 'many', 'people', 'have', 'written', 'positive', 'reviews', 'explaining', 'why', 'found', 'adaptation', 'very', 'entertaining', 'otherwise', 'worthy', '5', 'starts', 'Therefore', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'repeat.Instead', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'few', 'characteristics/particulars', 'stood', 'out', 'adaptation', 'Positive', 'characteristics:1.This', 'adaptation', 'really', 'Dickens', 'massive', 'novel', 'well', 'other', 'words', 'really', 'difficult', 'film', 'adaptation', 'effectively', 'show', 'how', 'many', 'subplots', 'characters', 'interact', 'film', 'brilliant', 'showing', 'interaction.2.The', 'acting', 'was', 'wonderful', 'film', 'think', '1985', 'adaptation', 'was', 'very', 'intelligent', 'contained', 'above-average', 'acting', 'acting', '2005', 'adaptation', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'think', 'especially', 'true', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'comparison', 'Diana', 'Rigg', '3.This', 'adaptation', 'very', 'thorough', 'Many', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'entirely', 'left', 'out', '1985', 'adaptation', 'Additionally', 'more', 'screen-time', 'given', 'minor', 'actors', 'Mr.', 'Guppy', 'Inspector', 'Bucket.4.This', 'adaptation', 'not', 'spend', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'showing', 'Inspector', 'Buckett', 'searching', 'Lady', 'Dedlock', 'secret', 'was', 'exposed', 'always', 'found', 'part', '1985', 'adaptation', 'be', 'boring', '5.This', 'adaptation', 'really', 'reminded', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'adaptation', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'may', 'appear', 'irrelevant', 'think', 'worth', 'noting', 'action', '2005', 'adaptation', 'generally', 'ENACTED/SHOWN', 'rather', 'TOLD', 'Also', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'major', 'houses', 'seem', 'appear', 'Bleak', 'House', 'music/noise', 'beginning', 'nearly', 'locality', 'shift.Negative', 'characteristics:1.The', '2005', 'adaptation', 'did', 'not', 'show', 'poverty', 'lower', 'classes', 'effectively', 'prolongedly', '1985', 'adaptation', 'example', 'fog', 'pollution', 'present', 'city', 'scene', '1985', 'adaptation', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'adaptation', 'am', 'not', 'criticizing', 'think', 'detail', 'noting.2.The', 'court', 'scenes', '2005', 'adaptation', 'were', 'not', 'prolonged', 'interesting', 'standpoint', 'criticism', 'Chancery', 'lawyers', '1985', 'adaptation', '[', 'However', 'disagree', 'two', 'reviewers', 'who', 'gave', 'adaptation', '1', 'star', 'one', 'detail', ']', 'Neutral', 'characteristics:1.The', 'mood', '2005', 'adaptation', 'simply', 'not', 'bleak', 'mood', '1985', 'adaptation', 'other', 'words', '1985', 'adaptation', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'criticizing', 'culture', 'legal', 'system', 'Britain', 'where', '2005', 'adaptation', 'focus', 'more', 'characters', 'plot', 'making', 'certain', 'plot', 'subplots', 'are', 'well-explored.2.The', '2005', 'adaptation', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'might', 'call', 'slightly', 'boring', 'so', 'predictable', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'novel', 'contrast', '1985', 'adaptation', 'sequenced', 'more', 'film', 'adaptation', 'mystery', 'novel', 'fog', 'mist', 'poverty', 'overall', 'eccentric', 'Dicksonian', 'characters', 'Part', '1985', 'adaptation', 'not', 'show', 'character', 'interactions', 'subplots', 'as', 'well', '2005', 'adaptation', 'However', 'think', '1985', 'adaptation', 'did', 'strive', 'maintain', 'suspense', 'pretext', 'mystery.In', 'conclusion', 'think', 'adaptation', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'However', 'opinion', '2005', 'adaptation', 'better', '1985', 'especially', 'plot', 'accuracy', 'standpoint']",N/A

To my great good fortune, I did not come upon Dickens until college, and then I was introduced through this, arguably his finest novel. For BLEAK HOUSE is as complex - though never as obfuscating - as the lawsuit that lies at the center of its plot. Dozens and dozens of characters are caught up in the trap of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce: noble lords and ladies, penniless madwomen, hypocrites, lawyers, monsters and innocents alike spread throughout the pages of this magnificent, lengthy novel. I remember years ago watching the first BBC version with Diana Rigg as Lady Dedlock and thinking, ""Well, they've butchered it to pieces, but I guess this is the best one can hope for. At least the acting is good!"" At last, a new version has come along that tops the original in every way. It feels more complete in terms of story, it perfectly captures the foggy atmosphere of dread and gloom, and under the guidance of a great production team, Andrew Davies' fine script brings the book to life in ways that the Rigg version could not.This was one of the very first whodunnits ever created, but of course it's so much more than that.

She is quite the fan of Dickens, having discovered him not long ago and is impressively working her way through his catalog.  As for myself, I've enjoyed the few novels of his that I've read, but as far as the adaptation goes, when I see the words 'BBC' and 'Classic Literature', my eyes start to glaze over.No worries though as I was caught up in the series almost immediately.  Dickens always was a bit keen on melodrama, considering most of his output was serialized in the papers first, and 'Bleak House' might even outdo some of his other works in that regard, but that's a minor distraction if at all.  What makes the adaptation stand out so well, in my mind, are both the casting and the editing.'Bleak House' is a sprawling novel, filled with rich characters that can be difficult to keep track of if you don't pay attention - at least at first.  As an 8 1/2 hour miniseries though, the director had time to explore these people's idiosyncrasies and help the viewer differentiate between them.  But what faces the casting director found!  Several times throughout the series, both my fianc&eacute;e and I commented on the actors and how they very nearly carried their roles on their face alone.  I'm sure the magic of makeup had a lot to do with this also, and the actors themselves did excellent work, but still I was amazed at the variety.  Perhaps I'm a victim of Hollywood's generic casting, where, if you aren't the star, then the goal is to find the most non-descript faces around so there isn't any doubt as to who is the leading lady or leading man.Not only is 'Bleak House' filled with dozens of important characters, it is also a complex story - mostly written as a condemnation of the British court system at the time.  The directors chose, wisely I think, to concentrate more on the story of Esther Summerson, an orphan with a mysterious past.  Keeping these storylines from helplessly tangling with one another was a major success, one that I think you can point to the film editor for.  I won't say it was perfect (the crashing sounds accompanying the jerky transitional establishing shots got to be a distraction by film's end), but each brief segment of the story served its purpose by advancing the plot and keeping up interest.

Andrew Davies, the screenwriter, is able to move each scene along at a brisk pace, skillfully edited, but without sacrificing the rich subtleties of Dickens' language and characters. It's absolutely amazing how this modern speed has benefited this production. It's infused with refreshingly intelligent dialogue, characters that are sharply drawn and guided by their objectives that are clearly understood from the moment you meet them. Together, they give the story exuberance, vibrance, and intensity to situations that are utterly dismal or even horrifying. The story intensifies with the introduction of each character and it's absolutely thrilling to watch someone who's seemingly trivial become vastly important to someone who, on a social level, would normally have nothing to do with them. This story has it all: juicy secrets, lies, death, murder, blackmail- I can't recommend it enough! There's a fabulous cast: Charles Dance ( Mr Tulkinghorn) & Burn Gorman (Guppy) are most impressive. Philip Davis as Smallweed is so wonderfully yucky, he's just a huge belligerant blister and always out for personal gain. I was also shocked but delightfully surprised with Gillian Anderson as Lady Deadlock. We see a woman who, by birth is naturally distant, a cold but dutiful wife, and obviously depressed but very careful not to draw attention to herself. We know Lady Deadlock has a champion poker face, but what is important, what is so intriguing, is when we see a crack in the mask. Gillian is a smart actress to craft the movements of this self-controlled woman as if her life depended on them--and it does. I could go on and on about this wonderful character. It's maddening not to discuss the plot, the story being so utterly compelling. Adaptations of this kind are very rare. Thank you BBC.

This is based on the Charles Dickens classic, which was first published as a serialized novel and is now available in one rather large volume, and has been adapted by the brilliant Andrew Davies.  Bleak House is the typical Dickensian offering featuring a Victorian gothic atmosphere and a plot with mystery, intrigue, romance and tragedy with quite a few eccentric characters thrown into the mix.  Lady Dedlock (Gillian Anderson) hides a terrible secret that could ruin her reputation and make her husband a laughingstock among his peers, and she'd do just about anything to obtain some rather incriminating letters.  But the ruthless Mr. Tulkinghorn (Charles Dance) tries to get his hands on them first to gain power over the condescending lady.  Meanwhile, Esther Summerson (Anna Maxwell Martin) is the maid of two young cousins hoping to sort out an old will dispute and obtain their estates.  Esther hopes to get some answers from Mr. John Jarndyce (Denis Lawson) regarding her parentage, but discovers something quite unexpected from different sources.  The Jarndyce and Jarndyce estate case is prolonged and often postponed by the courts, where greedy lawyers take advantage of the situation.  The lives of all of the characters are connected somehow and what we get is a dark, compelling story centered on secrets and a corrupt legal system that literally dries up the hopes of getting justice.The above synopsis is kind of sketchy, but that is because I don't want to give away any important plot points or twists and turns.  I know how frustrating it is to read a review of a product with detailed spoilers and I don't want to do that to the potential viewer.  Anyway, Bleak House is one of the best BBC productions I have seen. I've seen quite a few and have yet to find one that bombs.  This one almost takes the place of North and South and Pride and Prejudice as my absolute favorites.  This one comes to a close third.  It's got fifteen half-hour episodes that keep you glued to the television.  The production quality is top notch -- excellent cinematography (which was shown in high-definition), great dark sets that create the perfect tone, gorgeous Victorian wardrobe and beautiful scenery of the countryside.  The cast couldn't be better.  Gillian Anderson is brilliant as Lady Dedlock.  I know Anderson is most famous for her role in The X-Files, but she has shown her range as an actress with this role and her portrayal of Lily Bart in The House of Mirth, which I watched some days ago.  She has a very expressive face and can transmit many emotions with her eyes.  Anna Maxwell Martin (who played Bessy Higgins in North and South) is another marvel as Miss Summerson.  She plays a rather complex character with a heart of gold and a sense of loyalty for her friends.  She is a very compelling heroine.  Denis Lawson is wonderful as Mr. Jarndyce and Charles Dance is flawless as the villainous Mr. Tulkinghorn.  I was also impressed with the actors who played the eccentric characters, like Burn Gorman as the infatuated Guppy, Philip Davies as the irritating Mr. Smallweed (I cracked up whenever he asked his granddaughter to ""shake him up"") and Pauline Collins as Miss Flite, the one with several birds waiting to be freed.  This is a rather dark miniseries, there is some tragedy and various rather poignant scenes here, and the backdrop of the Victorian justice system is very insightful.  All in all, as said earlier, this is a true masterpiece and I cannot recommend it enough.  However, I do recommend that you read the novel first, for you may become lost keeping track of the plot lines and characters.",5,An absolute masterpiece!,1162080000,"10 29, 2006",2006,3810,"['saw', 'bit', 'show', 'when', 'aired', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'PBS', 'then', 'decided', 'wait', 'DVD', 'series', 'had', 'already', 'begun', 'wanted', 'see', 'based', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'classic', 'was', 'first', 'published', 'serialized', 'novel', 'now', 'available', 'one', 'rather', 'large', 'volume', 'been', 'adapted', 'brilliant', 'Andrew', 'Davies', 'Bleak', 'House', 'typical', 'Dickensian', 'offering', 'featuring', 'Victorian', 'gothic', 'atmosphere', 'plot', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'romance', 'tragedy', 'few', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'thrown', 'mix', 'Lady', 'Dedlock', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'terrible', 'secret', 'could', 'ruin', 'reputation', 'make', 'husband', 'laughingstock', 'peers', ""'d"", 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'obtain', 'rather', 'incriminating', 'letters', 'ruthless', 'Mr.', 'Tulkinghorn', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'get', 'hands', 'first', 'gain', 'power', 'condescending', 'lady', 'Meanwhile', 'Esther', 'Summerson', 'Anna', 'Maxwell', 'Martin', 'maid', 'two', 'young', 'cousins', 'hoping', 'sort', 'out', 'old', 'will', 'dispute', 'obtain', 'estates', 'Esther', 'get', 'answers', 'Mr.', 'John', 'Jarndyce', 'Denis', 'Lawson', 'regarding', 'parentage', 'discovers', 'something', 'quite', 'unexpected', 'different', 'sources', 'Jarndyce', 'Jarndyce', 'estate', 'case', 'prolonged', 'often', 'postponed', 'courts', 'where', 'greedy', 'lawyers', 'take', 'advantage', 'situation', 'lives', 'characters', 'are', 'connected', 'somehow', 'what', 'get', 'dark', 'compelling', 'story', 'centered', 'secrets', 'corrupt', 'legal', 'system', 'literally', 'up', 'hopes', 'getting', 'justice.The', 'synopsis', 'kind', 'sketchy', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'important', 'plot', 'points', 'twists', 'turns', 'know', 'how', 'frustrating', 'read', 'review', 'product', 'detailed', 'spoilers', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'potential', 'viewer', 'Anyway', 'Bleak', 'House', 'one', 'best', 'BBC', 'productions', 'have', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'have', 'yet', 'find', 'one', 'one', 'almost', 'place', 'North', 'South', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'absolute', 'one', 'close', 'third', 'got', 'fifteen', 'half-hour', 'episodes', 'keep', 'glued', 'television', 'production', 'quality', 'top', 'notch', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'was', 'shown', 'high-definition', 'great', 'dark', 'sets', 'create', 'perfect', 'tone', 'gorgeous', 'Victorian', 'wardrobe', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'countryside', 'cast', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'better', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'brilliant', 'Lady', 'Dedlock', 'know', 'Anderson', 'most', 'famous', 'role', 'X-Files', 'shown', 'range', 'actress', 'role', 'portrayal', 'Lily', 'Bart', 'House', 'Mirth', 'watched', 'days', 'ago', 'very', 'expressive', 'face', 'can', 'transmit', 'many', 'emotions', 'eyes', 'Anna', 'Maxwell', 'Martin', 'who', 'played', 'Bessy', 'Higgins', 'North', 'South', 'marvel', 'Miss', 'Summerson', 'rather', 'complex', 'character', 'heart', 'gold', 'sense', 'loyalty', 'friends', 'very', 'compelling', 'heroine', 'Denis', 'Lawson', 'wonderful', 'Mr.', 'Jarndyce', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'flawless', 'villainous', 'Mr.', 'Tulkinghorn', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'Burn', 'Gorman', 'infatuated', 'Guppy', 'Philip', 'Davies', 'irritating', 'Mr.', 'Smallweed', 'cracked', 'up', 'whenever', 'asked', 'granddaughter', 'shake', 'up', 'Pauline', 'Collins', 'Miss', 'Flite', 'one', 'several', 'birds', 'waiting', 'be', 'freed', 'rather', 'dark', 'miniseries', 'tragedy', 'various', 'rather', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'here', 'backdrop', 'Victorian', 'justice', 'system', 'very', 'insightful', 'said', 'earlier', 'true', 'masterpiece', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'enough', 'However', 'do', 'recommend', 'read', 'novel', 'first', 'may', 'become', 'lost', 'keeping', 'track', 'plot', 'lines', 'characters']",N/A

This 15 part series which is available on three discs immediately captured our imagination as we started watching it.The screenplay by Andrew Davies, based on Charles Dickens novel, compelling captures the dark side of London and the callous indifference to the value of human life exhibited by many during the time of the story which has been estimated to be around 1827. Mr. Davies, who also did the screenplay for BBC's version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" which featured Colin Firth, provides a solid foundation for excellent acting by many familiar British actors.My wife especially found the occasional loud sounds which seemed to announce a change of scenes to be annoying; I jokingly referred to them as chapter headings in bold font. The sounds didn't bother me although they were sometimes rather jarring I'll have to admit. Other than that rather minor point I found the entire series to be captivating; we sometimes felt a driving desire to continue to the next episode and found ourselves spending more time than anticipated watching the series because we were really curious as to what would happen next.This BBC production combines good writing and acting resulting in a powerful story.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","Out of all Charles Dickens' novels, &#34;Bleak House&#34; is the most daunting to adapt -- a complicated book with many characters and multiple storylines.And the latest BBC adaptation of that novel more or less captures the story: a grey, misty experience where unpleasant secrets are buried just under the surface. Some of the details are trimmed off, but the story is compelling and dramatic and the talented cast -- with Anna Maxwell Martin, Gillian Anderson and Denis Lawson in the spotlight -- are more than enough to drive it forward.The bizarre case of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce has been dragging on for years, and the latest claimants are a pair of orphans, Richard (Patrick Kennedy) and Ada (Carey Mulligan). An unrelated orphan, Esther Summerson (Martin) is hired to be Ada's companion, and all three are moved into the home of the wealthy John Jarndyce (Lawson). Richard and Ada fall in love, but his aimless ways throw their future into doubt, especially when he runs through three potential careers in a matter of weeks.At the same time, wealthy and bored Lady Dedlock (Anderson) recognizes the handwriting of a mysterious opium addict known only as Nemo (whose actual name turns out to be Captain Hawdon), and begins making inquiries about the circumstances of his life and death. Her husband's sinister lawyer Mr. Tulkinghorn  (Charles Dance) notices her interest, and begins gathering information about whatever she's keeping secret.That secret involves Esther, who is struggling with a one-two punch of losing the man she loves (to the navy, not to death) and disfiguring smallpox. And after Tulkinghorn threatens to reveal Lady Dedlock's secret, he's found dead -- and Lady Dedlock soon finds herself the primary suspect.Even though &#34;Bleak House&#34; is a pared-down version of the novel, there is still a wealth of important characters and subplots that are hard to summarize -- there's Caddy and her quest to escape her mom, her marriage and baby; the weird old lady with the dozens of birds and the creepy landlord; and the whole odd situation with Lady Dedlock and her two maids -- one of whom she seems to see as a surrogate daughter.While the story initially seems cluttered with lots of extra subplots, they all slowly wind together into the main ones, which are on the orphans/Jarndyce Vs. Jarndyce, and Esther's secret connection to Lady Dedlock. Even small scenes and characters are often a part of this. Perhaps &#34;Bleak House's&#34; biggest problem is that it's... well, bleak. Everything is grey and shadowy, which sometimes makes it hard to see what's going on. The only well-lit scenes -- perhaps symbolically -- are at Bleak House when Jarndyce is around.The acting in this is quite good, especially from the three lead characters. Martin is well-cast as the quiet, rather downtrodden Esther, whose purity acts like a candle to moths -- at least three guys develop feelings for her, ranging from Guppy's temporary stalker-crush to Jarndyce's sweet self-sacrificing love. Lawson also adds some dimension to Dickens' stock kindly-uncle figure -- Jarndyce is a genuinely good man, but also somewhat moody and awkward.And of course, Gillian Anderson as Lady Dedlock. She's kind of wooden when she complains about boredom, but is pretty excellent when she has something to work with -- icy and haughty, but with deep currents under her alabaster face. Mulligan and Kennedy do acceptable jobs, but at times their characters feel like naive annoyances to the characters who have actual problems.&#34;Bleak House&#34; strips down a bit of the story, but the complicated core of Dickens' novel is intact -- complicated subplots, a solid cast and a dramatic period-soap-opera presentation.

Unlike the more sedate series of the 1980s (with Diana Rigg and Denholm Elliott), this version draws you deeply into the characters' emotions. You laugh when Guppy proposes marriage, you cry when Esther weeps, you get mad at the Chancery Court. This is what drama is supposed to do, so in that sense the series was a rousing success.The casting was virtually flawless. Gillian Anderson did a superb job as the remote, but anguished, Lady Dedlock. Charles Dance made a thoroughly nefarious Tulkinghorn, and Nathaniel Parker a quirky, yet devious, Skimpole. The only character who marched out of step was Esther, who, unfortunately, bore no resemblance to her mother. (A crucial plot point was that Esther was supposed to have been the spitting image of the great beauty. Not only was she unaccountably plain in this version, she showed none of her mother's backbone.)Unfortunately, the jarring soundtrack (imagine an anvil being struck by a cannonball),one-second scene shifts, and trendy hand-held camera work interjected a look that was entirely inconsistent with the period. And the omission of dialogue which would have clarified the convoluted story line resulted in outright confusion at times. (Dickens wrote Bleak House as an overlong expose of Britain's corrupt judiciary, a theme which would have lent more coherence to this production, but which was often lost in the throes of high melodrama.) With a little more subtlety in the directing, less trendy filming, and a period-appropriate sound track this series could have been truly magnificent.",4,"Strong actors, jarring soundtrack, trendy filming",1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,1628,"['remake', 'Dickens', 'Bleak', 'House', 'was', 'notable', 'powerful', 'acting', 'more', 'sedate', 'series', '1980s', 'Diana', 'Rigg', 'Denholm', 'Elliott', 'version', 'deeply', 'characters', 'emotions', 'when', 'Guppy', 'proposes', 'marriage', 'cry', 'when', 'Esther', 'get', 'mad', 'Chancery', 'Court', 'what', 'drama', 'supposed', 'do', 'so', 'sense', 'series', 'was', 'rousing', 'success.The', 'casting', 'was', 'virtually', 'flawless', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'remote', 'anguished', 'Lady', 'Dedlock', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'made', 'thoroughly', 'nefarious', 'Tulkinghorn', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'quirky', 'yet', 'devious', 'Skimpole', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'marched', 'step', 'was', 'Esther', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'bore', 'resemblance', 'mother', 'crucial', 'plot', 'point', 'was', 'Esther', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'been', 'spitting', 'image', 'great', 'beauty', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'unaccountably', 'plain', 'version', 'showed', 'none', 'mother', 'backbone', 'Unfortunately', 'jarring', 'soundtrack', 'imagine', 'anvil', 'being', 'struck', 'cannonball', 'one-second', 'scene', 'shifts', 'trendy', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'work', 'interjected', 'look', 'was', 'entirely', 'inconsistent', 'period', 'omission', 'dialogue', 'would', 'have', 'clarified', 'convoluted', 'story', 'line', 'resulted', 'outright', 'confusion', 'times', 'Dickens', 'wrote', 'Bleak', 'House', 'overlong', 'expose', 'Britain', 'corrupt', 'judiciary', 'theme', 'would', 'have', 'lent', 'more', 'coherence', 'production', 'was', 'often', 'lost', 'throes', 'high', 'melodrama', 'little', 'more', 'subtlety', 'directing', 'less', 'trendy', 'filming', 'period-appropriate', 'sound', 'track', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'magnificent']",N/A

The direction, production, music and acting are all performed at the highest level.It is 15 episodes from Masterpiece Theatre and that may seem like a lot (it did to me when I first thought of watching it) but believe me when I say it goes by incredibly fast.

958287,A9MAUO67ABVOB,B000CEXG0U,"F. Behrens ""Frank Behrens""","[245, 257]","For once, I am happy to find a remake of a fine old Masterpiece Theatre offering that is as good as the original. ""Bleak House"" is currently available on an DVD with Diana Rigg as the most familiar name; and except for some incomprehensible line readings by a young character named Joe, it is a very good account of the Dickens novel. Having already appeared on Public Television, the remake has Gillian Anderson (yes, the one from ""X-Files"") as Lady Dedlock, and a cast of 80 speaking roles, many of which are played by actors that will send you searching the cast listings that go by too quickly at the end of each episode.The eight parts will be shown so that the first and last will run two hours and the four in between an hour each. I found the complex plot actually easier to follow in this version than I did in the earlier one. And while I prefer Rigg to Anderson, I think I can easily recommend this new adaptation over the other.The story--lawyers will hate it--involves the infamous Court of Chancery in which disputes over estates can be buried for years until the lawyers' fees make further legalizing unnecessary. Against this background, the case of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce being a major part of it, we have the story of John Jarndyce (Denis Lawson), his ward Ada (Carey Mulligan), her companion Esther (Anna Maxwell Martin), and Ada's beloved Richard (Patrick Kennedy).The latter becomes obsessed with the case, while Esther becomes involved in the mysterious past of Lady Dedlock, who happens to recognize the handwriting on some legal documents delivered by the utterly immoral family solicitor Tulkinghorn (Charles Dance). I will not reveal any more of the plot, lest it spoil your enjoyment. You will wind up guessing much of it, but it is a lot of fun--unless you are a lawyer.Peripheral to the plot are the usual cast of Dickens ""characters"": Krook the junkman (Johnny Vegas) who finds some incriminating letters (and dies the strangest death in all fiction), Smallweed the moneylender (Phil Davis) who cannot walk by himself and must be  ""shaken up"" by his weird niece every few minutes and who gets the letters, and Miss Flite ( Pauline Collins) who looks forward to ""judgment day"" when her case will finally be settled and she can set her birds free.Most interesting of all is the policeman Bucket (Alun Armstong), the first real detective in English fiction. Although he looks like a toady for the rich, he does his job and does it well, solving a murder case and being considerate to a certain lady who would suffer if her connection with the case should come out.Of course, the arm of coincidence in Dickens is a long one; and while a good deal of the plot does strain credulity, the acting and period ambience are of the highest level. The only thing that annoyed me was the director segmenting his ""establishing shots"" (exterior views of buildings to let us know where we are) into two or three rapid cuts with some electronic ""whoosh"" for each one.

Presumably, this was done to attract and keep the attention of the masses (or the American market).  While a little annoying, one gets used to it.  Furthermore, the rest of this is simply marvelous so you can overlook these little annoyances.So many standout performances, I almost don't know where to start.  I guess I would single out Charles Dance as Tulkinghorn as being my favorite.  Gillian Anderson was a revelation.  She simply transformed herself for this role and embodied the character of Lady Dedlock.  A few people in smaller roles, such as Burn Gorman as Guppy, and Nathaniel Parker as Skimpole, almost stole whatever scenes they are in.  Really, every performance was fantastic.Perhaps, the one somewhat weak link would be Anna Maxwell Martin as Esther.  I think she is a fine actress.  However, as others have pointed out, she might not have been the best choice for this role.  I was almost a bit confused when I first saw this (I hadn't read the book at the time) in that I couldn't figure out why everyone kept noticing the physical resemblance between her character and Lady Dedlock.

Making this film rather ""easy"" to follow in terms of plot, characters and mood is just the way it is presented in a series format. There are 8 episodes, each approximately 30 minutes long, which allows someone to easily leave and then pick up the story again.As with any Dickens' book, there are many plots to follow. The main one is Esther Summerson's arriving as the house of Jarndyce and trying to not only discover who she is (her background), but come to terms with the events of her ""disgraceful"" birth and her mother, who she has never met. Other subplots include Jarndyce's influence over Esther and the other two orphans who comes to stay, Ada Claire and Richard Carstone, as well as the seemingly never-ending case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, which seems to have an ill-effect on those who become too obsessed with it. As the story unfolds, Esther discovers more and more about her mysterious past. Like many of Dickens books, there are many references to untimely and strange deaths, mysteries that need to be resolved, cased that need to be closed, and a bevy of villains and heroes.Likewise, there are many interesting and eccentric characters to keep track of. We have mysterious Lady Dedlock (Gillian Anderson), callous lawyer Tulkinghorn, greedy Smallwood, scatterbrained Miss Flite, odd and unusual Guppy, noble characters like Captain George and Allan Woodcourt, orphan boy Jo, and quick-witted Detective Bucket among others.This is a magnificent series that captures the essence of Dickens. While the film itself is quite long, it doesn't seem long because there is so much to tell. What makes the story a joy to watch are the detailed scenery, lighting, costumes and superb acting.

I thought it worked out well and the subsequent audience viewing figures were impressive taking into consideration other distractions for those seeking stimulating entertainment over the holidays.Speaking as a mere chap I was particularly taken with the unyielding and perhaps unnerving close-ups of the beautiful scrubbed faces of the actresses playing Esther and Ada.  Neither a beauty in the contemporary sense but I found their expressions of raw emotion a fine tribute to the sublime art of acting.  Rick's death in the last episode was particularly moving in this case and I was genuinely moved here - and the grieving ladies weren't the only one's to shed a tear...,5,What the Dickens...,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,1226,"['excellent', 'series', 'view', 'think', 'Dickens', 'novels', 'translate', 'well', 'television', 'medium', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see', 'one', 'made', 'Britain', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'stinker', 'Bleak', 'House', 'was', 'broadcast', 'Christmas', 'holidays', 'here', 'UK', '30', 'minute', 'episodes', 'unusual', 'zooming-ins', 'odd', 'camera', 'seem', 'disturb', 'reviewers', 'was', 'deliberate', 'attempt', 'part', 'director', 'grip', 'attention', 'short', 'attention-span', 'average', 'modern', 'viewer', 'end', 'episode', 'cliff-hanger', 'moment', 'thought', 'worked', 'out', 'well', 'subsequent', 'audience', 'viewing', 'figures', 'were', 'impressive', 'taking', 'consideration', 'other', 'distractions', 'seeking', 'stimulating', 'entertainment', 'holidays.Speaking', 'mere', 'chap', 'was', 'particularly', 'taken', 'unyielding', 'perhaps', 'unnerving', 'close-ups', 'beautiful', 'scrubbed', 'actresses', 'playing', 'Esther', 'Ada', 'beauty', 'contemporary', 'sense', 'found', 'expressions', 'raw', 'emotion', 'fine', 'tribute', 'sublime', 'art', 'acting', 'Rick', 'death', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'particularly', 'moving', 'case', 'was', 'genuinely', 'moved', 'here', 'grieving', 'ladies', 'were', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'shed', 'tear']",N/A

Perkins ""wide reader""","[2, 2]","SPOILERS FOLLOWThis is a rare thing:  A very good film of a classic story, brimming with modern flair which doesn't detract from or attempt to dilute the original story and themes.  Expertly cast and shot, it demands repeat viewing both for the enjoyable twistings of plot, and to savor true, old-fashioned acting.The film is based on Charles Dickens' dramatic book of the same name, and features an array of established actors as well as some younger ones who have worked on other projects.  The unlikely casting of Gillian Anderson as Lady Dedlock works well, as she perfectly embodies her character.  Additionally, Carey Mulligan, who has more recently attracted notice for her work in ""An Education"" makes for a charming Ada Clare.  Denis Lawson, though not a widely publicized actor in the United States, had a bit part years ago in George Lucas's original ""Star Wars"" film.  Here, he plays the pivotal and meaty role of John Jarndyce, and he plays it extremely well, being both frankly kind and pained by the miserable grinding of the lawsuit which bears his name.  Burn Gorman, who here plays the sizable role of William Guppy, is the sort of young actor who comes along once in a very great while and inspires confidence that he could develop into an acting giant over time. In this production, he drives home the odd combination of slippery untrustworthiness and genuine sympathy the viewer conflictingly feels toward Guppy.  Mr. Gorman also had a significant part in the British science fiction show ""Torchwood.""  Lastly, Anna Maxwell Martin as Esther Summerson and fabulous character actors Charles Dance and Alun Armstrong as, respectively, Tulkinghorn and Inspector Bucket, give solid performances that add to the professional sheen of this production.The picture and sound of the Blu-Ray Disc is pristine, with extremely bright colors popping off of the screen.  Additionally, the sound mix is very rich and satisfactory, worthy of a film produced for the theater rather than television.I can't recommend this film highly enough if you appreciate creative and faithful literary adaptations.",5,A classic filmed in a modern style with awesome results,1263168000,"01 11, 2010",2010,2104,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWThis', 'rare', 'thing', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'classic', 'story', 'brimming', 'modern', 'flair', ""n't"", 'detract', 'attempt', 'dilute', 'original', 'story', 'themes', 'Expertly', 'cast', 'shot', 'repeat', 'viewing', 'enjoyable', 'twistings', 'plot', 'savor', 'true', 'old-fashioned', 'acting.The', 'film', 'based', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'dramatic', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'array', 'established', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'younger', 'ones', 'who', 'have', 'worked', 'other', 'projects', 'unlikely', 'casting', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Lady', 'Dedlock', 'well', 'perfectly', 'character', 'Additionally', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'who', 'more', 'recently', 'attracted', 'notice', 'work', 'Education', 'charming', 'Ada', 'Clare', 'Denis', 'Lawson', 'not', 'widely', 'publicized', 'actor', 'United', 'States', 'had', 'bit', 'part', 'years', 'ago', 'George', 'Lucas', 'original', 'Star', 'Wars', 'film', 'Here', 'pivotal', 'meaty', 'role', 'John', 'Jarndyce', 'extremely', 'well', 'being', 'frankly', 'kind', 'pained', 'miserable', 'grinding', 'lawsuit', 'name', 'Burn', 'Gorman', 'who', 'here', 'sizable', 'role', 'William', 'Guppy', 'sort', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'along', 'once', 'very', 'great', 'inspires', 'confidence', 'could', 'develop', 'acting', 'giant', 'time', 'production', 'home', 'odd', 'combination', 'slippery', 'untrustworthiness', 'genuine', 'sympathy', 'viewer', 'conflictingly', 'Guppy', 'Mr.', 'Gorman', 'also', 'had', 'significant', 'part', 'British', 'science', 'fiction', 'show', 'Torchwood', 'Lastly', 'Anna', 'Maxwell', 'Martin', 'Esther', 'Summerson', 'fabulous', 'character', 'actors', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'respectively', 'Tulkinghorn', 'Inspector', 'Bucket', 'give', 'solid', 'performances', 'add', 'professional', 'sheen', 'production.The', 'picture', 'sound', 'Blu-Ray', 'Disc', 'pristine', 'extremely', 'bright', 'colors', 'popping', 'screen', 'Additionally', 'sound', 'mix', 'very', 'rich', 'satisfactory', 'worthy', 'film', 'produced', 'theater', 'rather', 'television.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'film', 'highly', 'enough', 'appreciate', 'creative', 'faithful', 'literary', 'adaptations']",N/A

My kids got into the mystery elements of the tale, and my husband liked all the odd characters. As the only member of my household to have read the book, I withhold one star on my review because I felt much of the book's depth was missing. Yes, I realize Dickens' books are so ""meaty"" it's almost impossible to squeeze it all in, but I ended up having to explain a lot of what was going on to my family as we were watching. They didn't get what was going on with the whole Jarndyce case at all. So overall, I'd say the film was well done and worth buying for one's collection, but I think it could have done a few things better. The comedic characters, particularly Guppy and Inspector Bucket, just about stole the show. My husband and kids sure seemed to think so. I felt that Gillian Anderson's portrayal of Lady Dedlock was lovely, but I didn't much care for the actress who played Esther. I don't want to spoil the mystery, but there was something about Esther's appearance that was crucial to the plot, and this actress lacked those features.

But despite its showy jump-cuts and narrative drive, it's not really a very true adaptation of the original Dickens novel: for one thing, there's very little of the polluted fog (what we would call smog today) that completely permeates Dickens's London from the novel's opening words, and all the rooms look carefully swept--the London poor live on far too clean and grand a scale (Mr. Krook's rag-and-bone shop practically looks inviting in this adaptation). While you have the narrative drive here akin to a mid-Victorian sensation novel you miss much of the atmosphere. Gillian Anderson works hard as the haughty Lady Dedlock, and she's genuinely affecting, but when you compare her to Diana Rigg in the 1985 BBC version (which is general is far truer in feeling to the original source material, although it leaves key characters like the Jellybys out) she seems to be trying too hard.",3,Where's the fog?,1234483200,"02 13, 2009",2009,1236,"['startling', 'overrated', '2005', 'BBC', 'version', 'Dickens', 'most', 'complex', 'novel', 'certainly', 'excited', 'many', 'people', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'absolutely', 'excellent', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'sinister', 'Tulkinghorn', 'Timothy', 'West', 'devoted', 'Sir', 'Leicester', 'Dedlock', 'Anna', 'Maxwell', 'Martin', 'loving', 'warm', 'Esther', 'Summerson', 'showy', 'jump-cuts', 'narrative', 'drive', 'not', 'really', 'very', 'true', 'adaptation', 'original', 'Dickens', 'novel', 'one', 'thing', 'very', 'little', 'polluted', 'fog', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'smog', 'today', 'completely', 'Dickens', 'London', 'novel', 'opening', 'words', 'rooms', 'look', 'carefully', 'swept', 'London', 'poor', 'live', 'far', 'too', 'clean', 'grand', 'scale', 'Mr.', 'Krook', 'rag-and-bone', 'shop', 'practically', 'inviting', 'adaptation', 'have', 'narrative', 'drive', 'here', 'mid-Victorian', 'sensation', 'miss', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'hard', 'haughty', 'Lady', 'Dedlock', 'genuinely', 'affecting', 'when', 'compare', 'Diana', 'Rigg', '1985', 'BBC', 'version', 'general', 'far', 'truer', 'feeling', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'key', 'characters', 'Jellybys', 'out', 'be', 'trying', 'too', 'hard']",N/A

Certainly there are some unnecessary and grandiose shots that accompany a slightly out-of-context whoosh. But for a story that jumps from place to place, a referential setting is quite helpful. That I did not mind.What I did mind was Gillian Anderson. I have never seen as much as one minute of X-Files, so I have no preconceptions. I found her annoying, cloying, and silly. Long stares, abrupt head turns, and choppy little remarks (seemingly written to never allow her accent to fade) were the extent of her acting. And a shame, because it reduces one of Dickens' most tragic and fully realized heroines into much less.  All the flaws usually ascribed to a Dickens novel are here, the beyond-outrageous coincidences, the saintly women, the goofy names, the plot that ties too much together. But Dickens also managed in this case to create a woman neither saint nor sinner, and that creation is much diminished in this version. How could her husband have loved such an iceberg?But the flaws in Anderson's work are overwhelmed by the glories seen elsewhere. No need to mention names, nearly everyone is spectacularly convincing. Small characters leap off the screen, with mannerisms and phrases that make them seem more real than is often the case with Dickens. And the look! Wow, This is a dark novel, and this is dark film. People in pre-electric England lived in a gloomy world with long, frightening nights illuminated by feeble candles. And most of this tale takes place in just such an environment. Scary, with danger close by, and good reason to be afraid.Andrew Davies did a wonderful job, as he has done elsewhere. And giving this complicated tale 6 hours serves it well. I only wish other BBC novels could get this much space to breathe.Wish we had a more detailed scale that 1-5, for there are few 5 star films.

Read the Amazon editorial review above, I agree with all of it.Dickens can be difficult to translate to film.  His cartoonish drawings of his characters, both literal and literary, are the stuff of political lampoon.  And he IS interested in politics; the politics of class, culture, the legal system, and how his characters are trapped in them, by situation, and by their own human choices.  His characters and story lines are so intricate that they must have been manna for the readers of his (no tv, no film) time period, but they can sometimes be dry and dull for a modern audience.Enter the skillfull writing of THE MASTER ADAPTOR  Andrew Davies, and a production that careens and slams prison doors from one story to another, and we are briskly carried along... in this story of secrets, blackmail, and the endless wait for the legal system to do... something... anything.As with most BBC casting, it is excellent... every single character not only LOOKS as they should, but can really act.  Nice to see Gillian Anderson break through and prove that yes, american actresses really CAN run with the best of them, if they get the chance to.  Anna Maxwell Martin as our lead protagonist is simply wonderful.  She has the kind of looks that we do not get to see in the hollywood casting system.  Her character does not rely on her appearance, because she knows she can not, but she becomes so dear to us, we care deeply about her, and her complexity and calm in the midst of chaos reveal her true inner beauty.  Through her we see the souls of others as they respond to her.Dickens is VERY interested in the devastation of the Brittish class system, and the costumes and sets bring this all darkly to life, from the filth and disease of the street urchins, the tattered foppishness of a dance instructor, the soldiers barracks and stark sleeping compartments, to the cluttered new money oppulence of Bleak House and the old dusty money feel of the house of the local aristocracy.The beginning is slow... neccessary to introduce the whole population of characters, and just when you think the train will never take off, it speeds into overdrive, and you scream with dizzy joy like a roller coaster ride.  We get all the benefits of todays cinematic language and style in telling, while losing none of the story and atmosphere.

It was originally published in 20 segments in a magazine and so it lends itself better, in my opinion, to a miniseries than even reading it. There are so many characters, the story is as complex as the interminable case of Jarndyce vs Jarndyce and the ending is somewhat bittersweet. In a way, it's very modern in its darkness and it is an awful lot like ""Downton Abbey"" (an estate tied up in a court case and the reversals of fortune of the heirs, illegitimate high-born daughters, several suspicious deaths, well, if someone were to accuse Fellowes of borrowing heavily from ""Bleak House"" I would probably nod agreement.)After trying to read ""Bleak House"" and even using an audiobook, I confess that I pretty much gave up on it. And I'm a huge fan of big books and Dickens. But ""Bleak House"" was, frankly bleak. This miniseries, however, is done so well, cast so beautifully and paced in a way that makes the dragging story exciting. The direction is what makes it, and the cinematography too. Fast segues between scenes, a dark overtone, close-ups on the wonderful faces of the actors and modern music in a very gothic-dark mood lend just the right air of nastiness, confusion, suspicion and doubt to this story. It has a sort of happy ending, but it's almost a surprise. Sometimes, one expects EVERYONE to be dead at the end.Well done!

Lewis (my favorite author) was asked in a letter which was his favorite Dickens novel, he said ""I think I'd have to place Bleak House at the top."" Suffice it to say that this wonderful BBC production does justice to Dickens' magnificent literary work -- and that is no mean achievement. Some have objected to the modern stylistic touches utilized in the filming, but I rather enjoyed them, and never felt they took away from the altogether classic nature of the story. The acting was superb all around, the writing superlative, and the original material (thank you, Charles) is some of the finest the English language has given shape to. I hesitate to single out any of the performances from the rest (so fine were they all), but if pressed I might say that Martin, Lawson, Gorman, and Dance were so excellent they could hardly have been better. But several others were also terrific ('Krook', 'Smallweed', 'Woodcourt', 'Sergeant George' ... oh, bother, I could go on), and there was no real weak link in the chain. Since it is not often mentioned I might add that the musical theme, with its air suggesting intrigue and forboding, maintains the high standard of this drama.

I got my copy from England, where the price is advantageous.  This was a risk, because it might have been blocked for use only in Region B.  Thankfully, this set turned out to be region-free.Stretched out to three discs in blu-ray just as in DVD, the picture seems to enjoy having plenty of disc space.

The book basically reads itself, it is fast paced and full of intricate plot twists and sub-plots.  The novel centers around the famous trial of Jarndyce and Jarndyce and two young orphans whose fate and fortune may depend upon the trial. The fate of young Esther Summerson is also centered around the story and this young brave heroine quickly works her way into our hearts.  Dickens does an excellent job of blending his wide range of characters together to create a Gothic classic.I had high expectations for this mini-series, and I was very excited when I learned that Andrew Davies was involved.  I have enjoyed all of his mini-series including Pride & Prejudice and Sense & Sensibility. I was extremely interested to see how he would capture the voice and tone of the novel and connect all the plots together into a short mini-series.  Even though this mini-series is a longer one there is not a wasted minute.  It moves fast and keeps the spirit of the novels.  The casting is magic and I love Gillian Anderson as Lady Dedlock, she was a true ace.

He was wonderful in one of the Alien series with Sigourney Weaver, playing the disgraced and shamed Dr. Sentenced to an off world prison colony, at the very beginning of his medical career. His care and devotion to the prison's patients and to Ms. Weaver in the face of doom, adversity and Xenomorphs, should have won him an academy award.He delivers a performance no less gripping in ""Bleak House"", as the cold and ruthless Lawyer Mr. Tulkinghorn. His wonderful voice (the Xenomorph's is a little more shrill) and his cold, heartless manner is similar to that of a Xenomorph (Alien). He is handsome, yet, loathsome in his silk and satin frippery, while he destroys one character after another. The terrible treatment of his Legal Assistant, is just deplorable.The dispatching of Lady Tulkinghorn, is a performance built on what must have been a hard and uncaring Edwardian based childhood. We never know why Mr. Tulkinghorn is so dreadful. (I have not read the book). We are not shown any glimpses from his past in the story of Bleak House, we can only wonder what possible deformities in his own childhood/life could have led him to become such a despicable person?But, it is the silkiness of his performances in both movies that I love. Mr. Dance can move seamlessly from a drug dependent Dr. who is managing the health care of several crazed, demented and murderous patients/criminals to the satin tongued, silk swathed Attorney with no more heart or kindness than the Alien Monster itself.Both characters (Mr. Tulkinghorn and the Alien, Xenomorph) are repeatedly dressed in black, both have large, formidable teeth, which they do not hesitate to use at every available opportunity. They are both capable of turning up in the most inconvenient places and of sussing out their victims, with brutal regularity. They show no mercy and both seem to be completely indestructible. Once they have decided on a victim(s), the chase never wears them down, they never weaken or even consider their behavior might be viewed by society, as unpleasant. Both Mr. Tulkinghorn and the Xenomorph, deliver bone chilling performances that are worthy of every accolade.I know that is it rather odd to compare a character from a futuristic, sci-fi movie to a Victorian character from a Charles Dickens story, but they are almost one in the same in nature, style and dress.

Dickens is a social critic and his representation of social classes and money is an absolute delight to me as he wove humanism into real characters and some of his characters are exceptionally unique and have become social caricatures to us today.This is a story of true love on many levels, often denied because of social class.

The BBC is arguably one of the best at turning a novel into a miniseries for TV. Combine the two and you have BLEAK HOUSE. The injustice in this case is the legal system that was known for dragging out the settlement of wills and estates until there was nothing left for the rightful heirs. The story begins in the Court of Chancery where the lawyers would meet regularly to give the court updates on their cases and get their fees approved. The heirs would be there, also, in hopes of some good news about their case, only to hear that 'progress was being made' and here's your invoice for services. The case in the story is Jarndyce and Jarndyce, a very large estate that has been contested for decades because there is a dispute over the will. Many have been ruined by the cost of the suit and many have given up, including John Jarndyce, an independently wealthy heir. He brings into his household a young man and woman, orphans and cousins, who are heirs and still hopeful of a settlement. Along with them comes a young lady who will be their personal attendant. From there the story takes many twists and turns as the lawsuit 'progresses' and so do their lives. It takes you from the country estates of the aristocrats to the squalid slums of the homeless as the plot emerges and expands. You experience the entire social strata of England during the story and how they are affected by the law. The acting is superb as well as the costumes, the music and the sets. It is 7.5 hours long so it is a commitment to watch but yet you can hardly stop watching. It is well worth the investment of time. A great story told by some of the best in the business.

Gillian Anderson refocuses her considerable acting chops to bring the luckless Lady Dedlock to perfect fruition. The relative scarceness of her scenes, and their critical importance to the story, makes her appearances even more tantalizing. The entire cast once again proves the English theatre tradition thriving, and is directed with consummate skill, and pride of detail. I love the redoubtable Pauline Collins as the quintessential Miss Flite, and Charles Dance is incendiary as the heartless Tulkinghorn. Anna Maxwell Martin (Esther Summerson) is a marvel to watch; she corners a self-assurance most actors only dream of, with ownership of every nuance of face and inflection - it's a huge performance of requisite Dickensian depth, perfectly tuned and delivered with the most gifted ease imaginable. It's worth every minute just to watch her copiously in her many scenes. Dickens' many minor characters never fail to justify their presence in his novels, however extravagant, and Bleak House has its profuse share. It's amazing how beguilingly the BBC has forged its remarkable history of mini-series of English literature; I can think of few, if any, failures. Bleak House is, bar none, one of its masterpieces.

This mini-series adaptation of the Dickens story is simply one of the best BBC miniseries I've seen.  I've not read the original, so I don't know if the adaptation is any good or not, but the screenplay is a masterpiece.  Additionally, this thing was excellently cast and produced 19th century period piece.The story follows the various personalities who have an interest in the long-adjudicated case of the great Jarndyce estate.  Some of those personalities, potential heirs, live in Bleak House, the home of John Jarndyce (Denis Lawson).  Mr. Jarndyce has agreed to serve as guardian of some of the younger claimants in the Jarndyce estate case, Ada Claire (Carey Mulligan) and Richard Carstone (Patrick Kennedy).  Accompanying these youth is a young woman who is their companion and housekeeper, Esther Summerson (Anna Maxwell Martin).The story is populated with manipulative lawyers (Charles Dance is wonderful as hardball legal man Mr. Tulkinghorn), hardnosed law enforcement types, and the great unwashed masses of the London social underbelly.  We also get to meet some of the London area upper-crust in their country house settings such as Sir Lester Dedlock and his lady (Gillian Anderson).  I particularly enjoyed Nathaniel Parker's Harold Skimpole, an obsequious hanger-on of the rich and famous who wanders about like a child but is actually quite a clever leech of a man.What relation does the mysterious law writer ""Nemo"" have with the Jarndyce case?

That said, the acting was good w/the exception of Gillian Anderson.  The DVD jacket describes her character, Lady Dedlock, as an ice cold aristocratic beauty.  Ok.  Had Anderson played the part that way, I would agree.  Instead, she came across as robotic and even that is a compliment to her acting.  She has an incredible talent for speaking w/out moving her lips and for sucking in her cheeks, apparently to appear even thinner than she already is.  When she finally did show some emotion (at least I think it was emotion because a tear escaped her eye and ran down her cheek), I wondered how long she had to sniff an onion before the director yelled ""Action!"".  She not only doesn't move her lips when speaking, she doesn't move her body either.  I've never seen anything like it.

If you love dark Victorian mysteries this is a must see. I remember hearing promos for the show stating its starring Gillian Anderson but I thought it was some English actress with the same name as Scully from the X-files. What a shock when I realized I watched Scully for I did not realize it at the time it was her. Ms. Anderson becomes Lady Dedlock replacing her FBI professional pant suits outfits for a Victorian frock. Although common elements to both characters are repressed emotions and icy personalities. I have not read the novel but the show is emphasizing the mystery aspects of the story with Lady Dedlock trying to hide a secret from her past, how everybody's fate is somehow bound into the Jarndyce case over disputed wills and what role if any Esther plays in all of this. Also, the series focuses a sharp eye on the byzantine legal world of Victorian England that makes the US legal system seem the epitome of efficiency. Charles Dance is great as the ruthless barrister Tulkinghorn who sets his sights on uncovering Lady Dedlock's secret. Anne Maxwell Martin is great as the innocent and virtuous Esther Summerson. Besides Ms. Anderson some might recognize Mr. Dance who has seen roles in various movies and TV series including the villain in the Eddie Murphy Buddhist action-adventure movie The Golden Child,  and Denis Lawson, who plays the benevolent John Jarndyce, was Wedge Antilles in the original Star Wars movies. Like any Dickens novel this TV series is filled with interesting often eccentric secondary characters from the young law clerk Mr. Guppy to Miss Flite.The atmosphere is dark with lots of mist, fog and rain as one would expect in a Victorian novel. You have the contrast of the romantic elegant world of Lady Dedlock's estate and the cozy feeling of Bleak House estate with the grim, mud and muck that the lower classes lived in. The period costumes and sets are top notch. The series for me captures the essence of the Victorian period.

Indeed, the sound of prison doors slamming shut united different story elements surrounding the main characters in the series:  young lovers caught up in the prison of an unrelenting legal battle, a young woman caught in the prison of her illegitimate station in life, a proper lady trapped in an unhappy prison of wealth and means, an honorable soldier living in the prison of opium addiction, etc.  As for the other reviewer who complained that the direction and editing of the program was jarring and called the program ""Masterpiece Theatre for the MTV generation,"" I say if you have enough time to count the length of the shots instead of following the storyline, then you have missed the point!  Far from being Dickens reduced to sound-bites, this series patiently and deftly allowed the characters to ripen and come into full bloom rather than just exist as caricatures.

But I will tell you, I was looking for a mini-series. Something to enjoy over time, like a long book. Well, Bleak House more than fit the bill, although I only managed to spread it over three evenings, I just kept wanting to watch it.If you are looking for something wonderful, that your mind will harken back to over and over, look no further. I'd love to go back and watch this again, for the first time. I admit, I was a little confused right at the beginning of the movie, but no worries, it all works out. As a viewer of many types of movies, I'm used to not trusting the 'good guy' to really be good, or the bad guy to not be seen as a good guy. So, because I enjoyed Denis Lawson as John Jarndyce sooooo much, I will tell you that he is indeed, a good guy. So, fear not when you watch this, his character is one you can trust and enjoy. I think he was my very favorite character in the entire series. He could be on Friends, he's such a good friend.Also, there are so many victorian style movies about love and loss, just the typical romance and then death. This movie is very different. Yes, you have all of that, but a mystery as well! There are turns and surprises, beautiful, absolutely stunning scenery and period appropriate clothing and settings. Many settings as well, not just one room in a house. So if you go in for the beauty of such films, again, you will not be disappointed.On to the other actors. I was actually put off by the idea of Gillian Anderson being Lady Dedlock. I've seen her in many episodes of X-Files and it was always hard for me to imagine her as anyone else. She did do a very good job in BH, but why they didn't give the role to someone with a real accent, I'm not sure. Plus, just to me, her fame made her stand out in the move, like a sore thumb kind of. But overall she was enjoyable and it all came together.Now, this was the first movie I had seen Anna Maxwell Martin in. As soon as it was over, I searched for all the movies she has been in and am currently going through them. I also looked her up and 'liked' her on Facebook. She was that good and made a deep impression on me. A fine actress, you will enjoy her.Now if you are not convinced, just consider the names for characters in this movie. Who would not want to watch a movie with people named things like Snagsby, Badger, Dancer, Skimpole, Jellyby!?  And of course, my favorite, Guppy. In all, he is a really good character as well. I didn't trust him to be good or bad, but by the end he was in my heart. What a wonderful, well-thought out character, perfectly played by Burn Gorman.In all, this is well worth the time and cost of the DVD. I'll admit, I didn't have my husband watch because I thought it would be more of a chick-flick romance, but I'm sure he's going to enjoy Bleak House.

I caught this production by chance on Masterpiece Theatre (actually at the time of my writing this I haven't even seen the whole thing... there's two more glorious episodes to go and I can't wait!) and since I missed the first hour of the first episode I decided to read the book to at least catch me up to the point I came in on.  Now after viewing each episode I go back and read the corresponding sections in the book to get all of the details.  One of the things I love about the book that is difficult to translate in the movie is Dickens' satirical humor and insightful commentaries on human nature ... I love it!!!  The movie is excellent... I already know I will buy the DVD.  I'm just enjoying the suspense right now of waiting until Sunday to see the next episode; for the first time ever I'm actually looking forward to the END of the weekend.

This time  I caught a lot of the wonderful little details that I missed then..Besides all the amazing actors who played the principle roles I'd like to give a shout out to some of the wonderful supporting actors.  Dickens drew some fascinating and humorous characters but in the hands of lesser actors they could have been played as cartoonish cliches.  Here the acting, (and directing,, no doubt) is so expert that we are privileged to see fully realized individuals who are totally believable even as they are sometimes bizarre.  The names are very funny, too....Dickens had the talent of giving just the right sounding names that define the character.  I loved the wonderful Guppy!  At first he was just an annoying upstart but after a while I became very fond of him, due in large part to his hilarious way of exiting a room!  What a great performance...reminded me of Groucho Marx.Likewise the fellow who played Smallweed (anther perfect name).  Who could forget his terrible teeth and &#34;Shake me up, Judy!&#34;  Even Judy, his grandaughter who does very little but shake him up, projects a very vivid sense of who she is.  Maybe the actor who got the most out of the smallest role was the fellow who played Mercury, the butler for the Dedlocks.  In a few brief scenes, with just a few facial expressions he manages to speak volumes about the class system.  (Another great name...Mercury).  I also loved Miss Flite.....her incantation of the names of her birds, ranging from the blissfull to the terrifying is truly chilling.  Tulkinghorn's clerk, also tells us a lot with just a few facial expressions....such fine acting!As other fine reviews have mentioned the principle actors I won't go into detail about them...only to laud their excellent performances.  The only exception, for me, was the one-tone performance of Gillian Anderson, who seemed to me to be trying too hard.  Maybe she felt out of her depth with the exceptional English cast?.I had to think of how Dickens would be amazed at how I can sit in my living room in 2014, in rural New Mexico, U.S.A. and totally enter into the world that he created out of his imagination so long ago!

It's tremendously long and complex.)So I looked forward to seeing a good video adaptation.The 1991 Diana Rigg version was a disappointment.  Far too dark.  Far too muddled in handling the many interweaving plots.But this ""Bleak House""--the Gillian Anderson version--is superb.First, it doesn't simplify.  It retains almost all the many, many characters, even though some period satire is lost.  (Mr. Chadband, for example.)  This conveys the huge sprawling complexity of Dickens's world.Second, it is both bright and dark visually--moving from glorious pastoral and rustic scenery to the dark typhoid misery and mud of Tom All Alone's.  This is thematically important, because the book is both very optimistic and darkly hopeless.Third, it knows which characters are key.  This version makes much of Mr. Tulkinghorn.  He becomes the evil lynchpin of all the many plots.  He is played wonderfully well by Charles Dance.It also does an excellent job with Esther Summerson--a hard character to make real, but absolutely pivotal to the plot and the theme of judging by character rather than class (and also the theme of the inevitable links between class).Likewise with the smooth faux-childish Harold Skimpole.Fourth, it moves the big and clumsy action along rippingly.  Quick jump-cuts, rapid changes, and unusual camera angles zoom the plots along at a rapid clip.This is the brilliant version of ""Bleak House"" I have been waiting for.

Simply by virtue of being a Dickens adaptation, it wins that race handily.I will also acknowledge that Andrew Davies' script was fine. And the actors, especially Charles Dance and Ms Anderson, were quite good.But how is one to really tell, given the direction and editing of this program? It was positively jarring. At one point, I began to count the length of shots. I never got beyond four seconds. FOUR SECONDS? Is this Masterpiece Theatre for the MTV generation? Does Masterpiece Theatre actually compete for the same target audience, as say, X-Men movies?Even more annoying (to say nothing of pretentious) was the zooming, sweeping shots that moved the action from one locale to another (accompanied by ""action movie"" sound effects!). It was totally out of character for a Victorian period piece, and apparently was an attempt to somehow make the story seem to be moving faster than it actually was (or for that matter, faster than it needed to move).This mini-series was not dreadful, and I guess these flaws were not deal-breakers for me. After all, wife and I did watch all the episodes despite them. But I think this ridiculous direction and editing will keep us from buying it.

958424,ABXBWSPM6YHAI,B000CEXG0U,"Rebecca Huston ""telynor""","[22, 22]","The time is the 1840's in Victorian England. The film opens with a court case being heard in what was then known as Chancery. A row of justices are hearing the case of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce, where an inheritance from several generations ago has the trouble of having several claimants, all of whom may be the correct ones. The case has dragged on for so long that people have committed suicide over the outcome, and others have grown withered and old waiting for a decision. As for the lawyers, they're estastic -- each one will be getting paid off first, and the longer they drag it all out, the more they'll get.The story centers around two young people, Richard Carstone (Partrick Kennedy) and Ada Clare (Carey Mulligan), who are cousins and fellow claimnants to the Jarndyce inheritance. The courts have deemed that they are too young to be on their own, so another relation, John Jarndyce (Denis Lawson) has offered them his guardianship and a home at his estate, Bleak House. As it would not be seemly for Ada to be alone, he has invited another young woman, Esther Somerson (Anna Maxwell Martin) to be her companion, and as we discover, to help him run his house. Bleak House, we discover, is actually quite pleasant, and Mr. Jarndyce is one of those people we like to meet in the real world -- he warns both Richard and Ada that to pin their hopes on the endless case is foolishness, and instead do as he did and make their own way in the world. But young Richard, as we see, is feckless and more than a little stupid -- he can't turn away his hopes of the money, and so plays at picking a profession whether it is law, or medicine, or anything else that would turn a living. We are also introduced to a friend of Jarndyce's -- Mr. Skimpole (Nathaniel Parker) who claims to be 'innocent as a child in all things' and who happily battens off of others, in the most odious fashion.On a neighboring estate, that of Sir Lester Dedlock (Timothy West) and his wife, Lady Dedlock (Gillian Anderson), there is also interest in the case. They are visited by their lawyer, Mr. Tulkinghorn (Charles Dance), who begins his own hunt when Lady Dedlock faints at the signt of the handwrighting on one of the legal briefs. Immediately, we're curious as to the why and who.The who is Mr. Nemo (John Lynch), a law writer who makes a scanty living by copying out documents for the lawyers. He's also a sad, beaten man who finds solace only in opium. His neighbor, Miss Flite (Pauline Collins), a distressed gentlewoman, has her caged birds for company as her own claim goes on forever in the chancery courts, with little hope for the future as well. And Mr. Nemo's only friend it seems, is Joe, a young streetsweeper who has a very fateful encounter with Lady Dedlock herself at the end of the first two hour segment.As we discover, not everyone in this tale will end happily or rich. Money, in some form or another, is the constant worry of this tale, along with a general condemnation of the law profession -- one result of Dickens' novel was that it created such an outpouring of anger at the Chancery Courts that the system was finally reformed.This one is a cold, chilling portrayal of the two extremes of early Victorian England. At one end you have the ease of the Dedlocks, John Jarndyce and Mr. Tulkinghorn. At the other is the grinding poverty of Mr. Nemo, Miss Flyte, and Joe. In between there are the uncertain futures of Ada, Richard and Esther, and indeed most of the characters in the novel. Money, and the lack of it, is one of the major themes of the story, along with family secrets, greed and outright lies.Some critics state that this was probably Dickens' finest novel. I'm inclined to agree, all of the characters are complex, with their own stories and desires giving them voice and depth. Too, Dickens' own wit and scathing humor is pretty evident in the dialog, and the names of the various characters throughout.This version comes in at 510 minutes, in a DVD transfer that is quite nearly perfect. The lighting at times is haunting with the use of polarized filters, the sound is crisp, and the acting top notch. Whoever did the casting in this was dead-on in their approach -- the most intriguing of the characters, Lady Dedlock and Esther, are perfect. Costuming and set design are perfect for the period. Too, the art directors were careful in not wallowing in the poverty-stricken parts of the story, nor in moralizing, they just show things as they were, and let the audience make up their own mind in what can be right or just.Another version of this was adapted for PBS/Masterpiece Theatre back in 1985, with Diana Rigg as the cold Lady Dedlock.DVD extras include: subtitles in English,This miniseries is one of the reasons why PBS?s Masterpiece Theatre and the BBC remain the gold standard as far as I am concerned.

Thus, the civil Court-house is the Bleak-house. We see the civil-lawyer-cartel is not interested in justice, but in making lots of money for themselves. The young man believes if he writes a clearer presentation, files another paper, then the Court will be just. We watch the young man's health ruined, his relationships ruined with his wife, children and friends. While the civil-lawyer-cartel gets richer. There is a humorous scene at the end, when the young man realizes he has been strung along.Mr. Dickens wrote Bleak House to expose the self-serving, cartel of civil-trial-lawyers, and lawyers in black-robes who deny the poor an unbiased hearing before a jury in civil-Court. This 2005 version, written by lawyers, shows the main character's home with dark furnishings, dimly lit only by candlelight, for a Bleak House to hide Mr. Dickens's true message.

Certainly, there is a lot to say and explain and show in a Dickens epic...his books were huge and his plots were thick.However, this adaptation of ""Bleak House""...a book I never read, having been warned it was one of his toughest to get through...is inspired.  It is quite ""talky"" but given its low budget, there is a really effort to make it cinematic.  The camera never sits still, there are abrupt scene changes, and it is lit and designed in a way that makes us understand that 150 years ago, everything was simply kinda grimy.  True, the lower your ""class"" the more grime you lived in...but even the wealthy lived in dark, cold homes, blackened by soot and made dim by interior lighting that was perhaps not quite as advanced as what we have today.  The world of this series feels a little ""bleak.""But the best part of this show are the fantastic performances.  Dickens always concocted the most delightfully over-the-top characters...and so often they are portrayed that way...OVER the top!  It can be fun in the hands of a good actor...but often a lot of the humanity goes out of it.  But in this version, everyone is firmly rooted in reality.  There are some outrageous characters whose actions are perhaps a bit hard to believe...but they are lovingly acted.  The leads (and Gillian Anderson...while quite important, is not the lead) are stellar.  Charles Dance, always a good villian, probably turns in his best performance here...he's quite a frightening man...certainly the most evil of lawyers!And Gillian Anderson brings a lot of shadings to her role.  Anyone who only knows her from X-Files will be quite surprised.  She appears to have aged a great deal, and grown gaunt.  A lot of this is makeup, but a lot is her very body language.  Her character, at least early on, is mostly bored...almost to the point of suicide, one thinks.  And Anderson makes us feel the weight of that boredom on her character.  Mrs. Dedlock is aptly named!This is a densely plotted story, and required careful attention to keep up with.  But for an audience willing to make the investment, you will be richly rewarded by a most modern BBC mini-series...one that feels very little like any that have come before.

958431,A1O8GCHZD1WX7F,B000CEXG0U,Robert Hardaway,"[3, 4]","I refuse to let this film's two serious deficiencies ruin it for be, and still recommend it with four stars plus. The first deficiency is the director's seemingly pathological determination to ruin a fine production with exasperating whooshing and screeching noises between scenes, and amateurish jiggling of the camera, which are apparently designed to give convey a sense of urgency to the story, but in fact  render  a feeling of queasiness. Average takes last only two to three seconds, again imposing only a sense of dizziness on the hapless viewer. In film school the first lesson taught is to keep the camera still and let the story tell itself with distracting attention to the cameraman. If viewers were interested in this kind of ""fast and furious"" they would watch American films  of that I'll, and would not be watching such fine productions as this of one of Dickens's literary masterpieces. The only other deficiency is the portrayal of Esther !s character who is most obviously not suited to the role, not least because she bares not even the remotest resemblance to the beautiful Lady Dedlock (played exquisitely by Anderson), a mossy critical element of the plot. Ithis is especially disconcerting in light of  how appealing the actress played esther in the1985  production with Riiggs. In everry other respect this production is magnificent-- exquisite costumes, gorgeous and authentic settings, outstanding acting by all the other characters. The only other bit of constructive criticism I might offer is in the editing, which often resulted in confusion and discontinuity in the story, especially in the first several episodes. That I still award a four star plus in spite of these glaring deficiencies is a tribute to what is in every other respect a magnificent production superior to 99% of the Hollywood fare inflicted upon us these days.",4,Refuse to let it's deficiencies ruin this wonderful  film,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,1862,"['refuse', 'let', 'film', 'two', 'serious', 'deficiencies', 'ruin', 'be', 'still', 'recommend', 'four', 'stars', 'first', 'deficiency', 'director', 'seemingly', 'pathological', 'determination', 'ruin', 'fine', 'production', 'exasperating', 'whooshing', 'screeching', 'noises', 'scenes', 'amateurish', 'jiggling', 'camera', 'are', 'apparently', 'designed', 'give', 'convey', 'sense', 'urgency', 'story', 'fact', 'render', 'feeling', 'queasiness', 'Average', 'last', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'seconds', 'again', 'imposing', 'only', 'sense', 'dizziness', 'hapless', 'viewer', 'film', 'school', 'first', 'lesson', 'taught', 'keep', 'camera', 'still', 'let', 'story', 'tell', 'distracting', 'attention', 'cameraman', 'viewers', 'were', 'interested', 'kind', 'fast', 'furious', 'would', 'watch', 'American', 'films', ""'ll"", 'would', 'not', 'be', 'watching', 'such', 'fine', 'productions', 'one', 'Dickens', 'literary', 'masterpieces', 'only', 'other', 'deficiency', 'portrayal', 'Esther', 's', 'character', 'who', 'most', 'obviously', 'not', 'suited', 'role', 'not', 'least', 'not', 'even', 'remotest', 'resemblance', 'beautiful', 'Lady', 'Dedlock', 'played', 'exquisitely', 'Anderson', 'mossy', 'critical', 'element', 'plot', 'Ithis', 'especially', 'disconcerting', 'light', 'how', 'appealing', 'actress', 'played', 'esther', 'the1985', 'production', 'Riiggs', 'everry', 'other', 'respect', 'production', 'magnificent', 'exquisite', 'costumes', 'gorgeous', 'authentic', 'settings', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'other', 'characters', 'only', 'other', 'bit', 'constructive', 'criticism', 'might', 'offer', 'editing', 'often', 'resulted', 'confusion', 'discontinuity', 'story', 'especially', 'first', 'several', 'episodes', 'still', 'award', 'four', 'star', 'spite', 'glaring', 'deficiencies', 'tribute', 'what', 'other', 'respect', 'magnificent', 'production', 'superior', '99', '%', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'inflicted', 'days']",N/A

Actors and actresses go without makeup (all but some mute lipstick), not even powder for the nose. This naturalness, combined with the grittiness of typical poor and lower middle class England of the early Victorian era, is so engaging see (not a time period seen too much in cinema). It isn't Hollywood, it's that periodic piece where you wonder if you were actually there watching it unfold.The realistic touches include the mud splatter on coaches, to the rumple dandy look of Guppy the clerk. The actors and actresses also have chapped lips to offer an even more emaciated feel. The production crew did their homework and tried to make the scene appear standard for the time. No gloss, no idealistic fantasy...stark reality.Cinematography of ""Bleak House"" sneaks up on you, as well. Totally surprised seeing the various camera angles for artistic views -- from the carriage window, to the dank dark hall of a flophouse (with candles in tow). The shots of Tulkinghorn make him look ever the rogue, right down to evilness of the icy blue eyes (don't meet him after dark!).

Sunday night Masterpiece Theatre has become a regular habit, initially b/c my options were restricted to only 13 channels through Charter's Limited Basic Cable/Internet package...now b/c the productions are so darn good! Gillian Anderson is wonderful as Lady Dedlock. She never quite nails the British accent, but her acting is so good, that her ""uppercrust"" American accent does not detract from her overall stellar performance.  Like so many Dickens' novels, timing, or rather bad timing, is everything.  Lady Dedlock abandons her estate b/f witnessing her husband's reaction to her past life. She was convinced that he could not love her knowing her ""shame."" I was heartbroken when she died before realizing how much her husband loved her and how little he cared about other people's opinions of her.  Esther got a chance to hold her mother before Lady Dedlock died in her arms.Lady Dedlock had transferred her motherly affections onto her lady's maid (a very young woman about the same age as Esther), since she thought a relationship with her real daughter impossible.  You can tell how much it meant to Esther when she discovered she had an indelible place in her mother's heart:  she found a handkerchief monogrammed ""E"" among Lady Dedlock's belongings.I never read Bleak House, so I did not know ""whodunnit.""  I regret that I briefly suspected Lady Dedlock b/c all of the evidence pointed towards her.

Wood ""Film scholar and vintage mov...","[17, 19]","Running just under eight hours, in 30 minute doses, the BBC's television adaptation of  Charles Dickens' mammoth novel BLEAK HOUSE is a stupendous success.  Though it has been cast to perfection and is gloriously crafted, its chief asset is a brilliant teleplay by Andrew Davies that makes a 1000 page novel exciting, engrossing, and fully understandable.  And co-directors Justin Chadwick and Susanna White make the action move furiously fast.  This is television at its finest, and Dickens would be enthralled.At the center of BLEAK HOUSE is the court case of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce, which has been dragging on for decades.  Three very sympathetic young people are potential heirs to a vast estate:  Ada Claire (Carey Mulligan), Richard Carstone (Patrick Kennedy), and Esther Summerstone (Anna Maxwell Martin).  Esther has mysterious parentage, hence a need for a true and up-to-date family will.  The young heroines are staying with likeable and wealthy John Jarndyce (Denis Lawson).  Family lawyer Tulkinghorn (magnificent Charles Dance) deals with an unpleasant money lender named Smallweed (Phil Davis), who may or may not have the original will in his possession that could hold the key to the whole case.  Tulkinghorn sets about comparing handwriting in all the documents he can lay his hands on, while Smallweed berates his timid clerk Mr. Guppy.  Lady Dedlock (the fabulous Gillian Armstrong) is also a key figure in the action.  Is she guilty or not guilty of a major murder that takes place 2/3 of the way through?  And what is her relationship to Esther?The audience knows more than the characters, so we have a lot of suspense.  But even the audience is caught off-guard when the mysterious past of Lady Dedlock is finally revealed.  Writer Davies is also superb at focusing major attention on the important characters and keeping the lesser characters in the background.  These include the timid law clerk Mr. Guppy, a nasty French maid who is a key murder suspect, police inspector Bucket (Alun Armstrong), and bird lover Miss Flite (Pauline Collins). Warren Clarke (A CLOCKWORK ORANGE a long time ago) has a small role.  The cast is mostly unknown to me, except for the never-better Charles Dance and Gillian Armstrong.  The ending is a very ironic, yet also happy one.As stated above, this is the 15 part British television version of BLEAK HOUSE, in convenient 30 minute segments in case you want to do one a night after work and dinner.  I got caught up in the exhilarating and atmospheric story fast and did the whole thing in three nights.  It comes in three equally convenient parts in the DVD boxed set--175 minutes, 145 minutes, and 145 minutes.  You can even hit ""Play All"" and do all three hours or two-and-a-half hours without moving from your chair or bed, except for a bathroom or food break as an episode break.  For ""Masterpiece Theatre"" on American public television, I believe it was in 60 minute doses with recaps at the beginning of each episode.  Those recaps are not on the DVD, seemingly were not shown on the BBC presentation, and could be helpful.  But watch this whole supremely watchable and glorious Dickens adaptation in three consecutive nights, as I did on DVD, and you should have no problem in following the intricate story.  It is all an irresistible invitation to tackle the huge novel.  Don't let the eight hour length scare you off.  This is as exciting and gripping as mystery television gets.

Adapted from the Charles Dickens novel, and formed around the internal furor of a long-drawn out inheritance court case bogged down with legalese and Jarndyces & Jarndyces, this is the tumultuous tale of a good man (a Jarndyce himself but of an entirely different sort) struggling to be the rudder to a family full of dysfunctional individuals whom he does his best to assist, protect and guide with his experience, his money and his natural wisdom.  He suffers from his own past and his own set of personal demons: his brother committed suicide over a matter of the finances which haunts him and will forever haunt him.  He has become benefactor to an ""orphan"" girl of whom little is known by anyone except himself; he recognizes in this girl the same intelligence, solid character that he himself possesses; the age difference is vast, however, and being the man he is inside, knows that it can never be and that a twist of time has prevented him from a true happiness with a like-minded woman.Beyond this is the interwoven secret of the fading but still elegantly beautiful ""Lady Dedlock"", splendidly cast with Gillian Anderson; possessed of a secret that will have an impact on many of their lives. Married to a kind, older man who adores her, and whom she cannot bear to hurt, her very countenance gives us the listlessness of her compromised marital situation.  But the secret she internalizes can no longer be contained when the lady recognizes by chance familiar handwriting as she reads a document that was written in a lovely, scripted hand by a ""law writer"" in the Jarndyce case. This ""page from her past"" we immediately discern is emotionally disturbing to her because she faints away, allowing another, less romantically inclined lawyer a glimpse into her psyche which would be better obscured from his sharp intuition.  We see the person who performed the service of the ""copier"" - obviously of good breeding and character gone awry, he is a broken individual, irreparably damaged by the drug of choice of that day, Opium - who has succumbed to disappointment in his life and lost everything of importance to him, including his soul.This is a nutshell review, and I have either omitted or failed to immediately recognize for what they were some of the subtleties in the film; this was the first time I had viewed it, and it is one that should be watched again to obtain full benefit, which I intend to do.

It brought brevity to this very long novel, but sacrificed none of the the drama, pathos, and yearning in each of the characters.

958454,A1M0OSCFOAMAZO,B000CEXG0U,taaj,"[0, 0]","I believe Dickens pioneered the soap opera and was absolutely brilliant at it. In Bleak House, he takes a whole bunch of unrelated characters and creates stories around them that weave in and out of each other then come together at the end. His formula always includes a Goodie Two Shoes. It's usually a poor child, but in this case it's John Jarndyce, a rich older gentleman who doesn't see status, wealth, family name or customs as barriers to doing the right and good thing for people. That's refreshing because Dickens can paint all rich people with a dark and evil brush. There has to be a dark, evil rich villain in a Dickens book though and that is the lawyer, Mr. Tulkinghorn. There are other baddies as well, but none so scary as Mr. Tulkinghorn. He is just mean for the sake of being mean. Another Dickens theme is that money corrupts. That is here as well. It's never preachy, but he gets his message across. In short, the Dickens formula is definitely at work in Bleak House, but he uses his elements in such a different way that it never feels like you are redoing Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby, Little Dorrit or any of the others. If you like Dickens, you will like this. The acting is fine. The settings definitely generate the appropriate feel and the story is top notch.

Almost every shot, every sound, every word hints that something else is left unseen or unsaid, that things are hidden and hidden for a reason, often resulting in tragedy.Each half-hour episode opens with a dreamy haunting theme. Situation shots do not zoom in smoothly but with a staccato that jars us awake. Protagonists pair off in shadows. The unsteady camera stares at faces up close from low angles, peering into cracked doors or between curtains. The feel of the thing is fast, edgy, and nervous.The production is carried with impeccable attention to period details yet its drama feels so modern we can hardly recognize this as Dickens.

958474,A347MRCA48RV4J,B000CEXG0U,wiser consumer,"[0, 2]","This adaptation of Bleak House is very well done in many ways, but it's been modified, sometimes considerably so, from Dickens' portrayal of the characters.  Trooper George, for instance, is no longer a ""gentle giant"" but a normal-sized hothead.  Esther and Lady Dedlock's resemblance to one another was remarkable in the book and is a key part of the story, but that is all but lost in this showing.  Perhaps the same actress should have played both parts.I do enjoy this BBC version and will probably keep it.  But, I would like to have seen something to this effect on the package: ""Charles Dickens, as loosely adapted by Andrew Davies.""  I prefer my Dickens straight.Addendum:  Not satisfied with this BBC version, and being a fan of Dickens who believes that, despite his shortcomings as a story-teller, anyone who thinks they can improve on him is pretentious, I ordered the earlier Diana Rigg BBC version.  I was not disappointed.That version is more faithful to the book, not only in its rendering of the story, but also the conditions in Dickens' London --- the environments in which the various characters interact.This critique is no criticism of the actors themselves --- they're a fine lot --- but is a criticism of Andrew Davies' adaptation.  If this version was intended to make Dickens more palatable to a younger audience, they would do well to read the book.

958477,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000CEXG0U,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","The BBC's 2005 adaptation of Charles Dickens' Bleak House is one of the best novel to screen adaptations I've seen in recent years. It is the perfect blend of skilled writing, a credible and amazing cast, and high atmosphere. As an avid fan of BBC period dramas, I have to say this adaptation of Bleak House is as close to perfect as I've seen, and I've viewed many BBC adaptations.Andrew Davies, who also wrote the screenplay for the memorable 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice (starring Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet), pens the screenplay here, and what an accomplishment! He perfectly captures the story in all of its complexities, not to mention the sheer size in terms of characters. Davies appears to possess the innate ability to manipulate the story contained within the novel to serve the purposes of dramatization, quite a feat considering the depth of the story and the time constraints inherent in the film medium. This adaptation is eight hours in length. Consequently, some minor characters have been culled from this adaptation, though not, in my opinion, to the detriment of the story. Some of the story arcs are also diminished, necessitated by the constraints of adapting a story within a novel to the screen.Dickens' novel dealt with the theme of judicial reform, and this is brilliantly portrayed in the BBC adaptation. The heart of the story centers around the years' long litigation in the case of Jarndyce v Jarndyce, focusing on inheritance issues, and overtly criticizing the painfully slow judicial process.In the screen adaptation, Anna Maxwell Martin portrays Esther Summerson, the heroine of the story. At the beginning of the story, Esther travels to Bleak House, the residence of John Jarndyce (Denis Lawson) together with Ada Clare (Carey Mulligan) and Richard Carstone (Patrick Kennedy), cousins who are also Jarndyce's wards. Esther is to be Ada's companion and comes under the guardianship of Jarndyce. The two cousins, Ada and Richard are beneficiaries under one of the stipulation's in one of the wills in the case of J v J, and Jarndyce is to be a beneficiary in another will in the same case.There's another beneficiary under one of the wills in J v J - a Lady Deadlock (brilliantly portrayed by Gillian Anderson), who is married to Sir Dedlock (Timothy West), and who proves to be closely connected to Esther. Then there are the villains of course, and this story has some truly wicked ones - sly lawyer Tulkinghorn (Charles Dance), money lender Smallweed (Philip Davis), etc.There are many other memorable characters, all well-cast and credibly portrayed, lending this production a rich feel in terms of characterization. It is also rich in period details, and brings Dickens' England alive. The only downside to this production is the way some plotlines resolve all too quickly, diminishing the emotional impact upon the viewer. Other than that, I can't recommend this series enough, especially for fans of Charles Dickens' works, and also fans of high quality British period dramas.",5,"A faithful, well-written, and well-cast adaptation of Dickens' classic novel",1350518400,"10 18, 2012",2012,3067,"['BBC', '2005', 'adaptation', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'Bleak', 'House', 'one', 'best', 'novel', 'screen', 'adaptations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recent', 'years', 'perfect', 'blend', 'skilled', 'writing', 'credible', 'amazing', 'cast', 'high', 'atmosphere', 'avid', 'fan', 'BBC', 'period', 'dramas', 'have', 'say', 'adaptation', 'Bleak', 'House', 'as', 'close', 'perfect', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'many', 'BBC', 'adaptations.Andrew', 'Davies', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'memorable', '1995', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'starring', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'Mr.', 'Darcy', 'Jennifer', 'Ehle', 'Elizabeth', 'Bennet', 'screenplay', 'here', 'what', 'accomplishment', 'perfectly', 'story', 'complexities', 'not', 'mention', 'sheer', 'size', 'terms', 'characters', 'Davies', 'possess', 'innate', 'ability', 'manipulate', 'story', 'contained', 'novel', 'serve', 'purposes', 'dramatization', 'quite', 'feat', 'considering', 'depth', 'story', 'time', 'constraints', 'inherent', 'film', 'medium', 'adaptation', 'eight', 'hours', 'length', 'Consequently', 'minor', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'culled', 'adaptation', 'not', 'opinion', 'detriment', 'story', 'story', 'arcs', 'are', 'also', 'diminished', 'necessitated', 'constraints', 'adapting', 'story', 'novel', 'screen.Dickens', 'novel', 'dealt', 'theme', 'judicial', 'reform', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'BBC', 'adaptation', 'heart', 'story', 'centers', 'years', 'long', 'litigation', 'case', 'Jarndyce', 'v', 'Jarndyce', 'focusing', 'inheritance', 'issues', 'overtly', 'criticizing', 'painfully', 'slow', 'judicial', 'process.In', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Anna', 'Maxwell', 'Martin', 'Esther', 'Summerson', 'heroine', 'story', 'beginning', 'story', 'Esther', 'Bleak', 'House', 'residence', 'John', 'Jarndyce', 'Denis', 'Lawson', 'together', 'Ada', 'Clare', 'Carey', 'Mulligan', 'Richard', 'Carstone', 'Patrick', 'Kennedy', 'cousins', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'Jarndyce', 'wards', 'Esther', 'be', 'Ada', 'companion', 'guardianship', 'Jarndyce', 'two', 'cousins', 'Ada', 'Richard', 'are', 'beneficiaries', 'one', 'stipulation', 'one', 'wills', 'case', 'J', 'v', 'J', 'Jarndyce', 'be', 'beneficiary', 'will', 'same', 'case.There', 'beneficiary', 'one', 'wills', 'J', 'v', 'J', 'Lady', 'Deadlock', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'who', 'married', 'Sir', 'Dedlock', 'Timothy', 'West', 'who', 'be', 'closely', 'connected', 'Esther', 'Then', 'are', 'villains', 'course', 'story', 'truly', 'wicked', 'ones', 'sly', 'lawyer', 'Tulkinghorn', 'Charles', 'Dance', 'money', 'lender', 'Smallweed', 'Philip', 'Davis', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'memorable', 'characters', 'well-cast', 'credibly', 'portrayed', 'lending', 'production', 'rich', 'feel', 'terms', 'characterization', 'also', 'rich', 'period', 'details', 'Dickens', 'England', 'alive', 'only', 'downside', 'production', 'way', 'plotlines', 'resolve', 'too', 'quickly', 'diminishing', 'emotional', 'impact', 'viewer', 'Other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'series', 'enough', 'especially', 'fans', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'works', 'also', 'fans', 'high', 'quality', 'British', 'period', 'dramas']",N/A
