I had this double feature laying around so I popped in the disc and away we go.The Pit may be a cult classic to some, but I found it pretty boring. A young boy talks to a teddy bear and has a pit with hungry monsters in it. He kills all the people that is mean to him and accidentally kills his caretaker, who is was obessed with. The thing I dont understand is they start the movie with a scene that is in the middle of the film for no reason whatsoever. A very weird film and one i'd probably never watch again.Hellgate was considered by most reviewers to be the worst of the lot. It features Horseshack from Welcome Back Kotter. It starts off with a vintage campfire with people telling ghost stories. It does start off pretty well but I fell asleep within the first twenty minutes. When I woke up, the movie was weird but looked good. It was very, very, very strange and I can see why people never talk about this film. I might try to watch it again because the last half hour was pretty unique.Overall, The Pit was decent and watchable. Hellgate was very unique and strange but again its watchable at least once. For 80's horror films this scrape the bottom of the barrel. The price is right for the double feature and if you can get if for a good price used, then buy it.",2,"Two great concepts, two bad movies",1246665600,"07 4, 2009",2009,1374,"['weather', 'being', 'more', 'fall', 'where', 'reside', 'fell', 'watching', 'horror', 'films', 'had', 'double', 'feature', 'laying', 'so', 'popped', 'disc', 'away', 'go.The', 'Pit', 'may', 'be', 'cult', 'classic', 'found', 'pretty', 'boring', 'young', 'boy', 'talks', 'teddy', 'bear', 'pit', 'hungry', 'monsters', 'people', 'mean', 'accidentally', 'kills', 'caretaker', 'who', 'was', 'obessed', 'thing', 'dont', 'understand', 'start', 'movie', 'scene', 'middle', 'film', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'very', 'weird', 'film', 'one', 'i', ""'d"", 'probably', 'never', 'watch', 'again.Hellgate', 'was', 'considered', 'most', 'reviewers', 'be', 'worst', 'lot', 'Horseshack', 'Welcome', 'Back', 'Kotter', 'vintage', 'campfire', 'people', 'telling', 'ghost', 'stories', 'start', 'off', 'pretty', 'well', 'fell', 'asleep', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'When', 'woke', 'up', 'movie', 'was', 'weird', 'looked', 'good', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'strange', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'never', 'talk', 'film', 'might', 'try', 'watch', 'again', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'was', 'pretty', 'unique.Overall', 'Pit', 'was', 'decent', 'watchable', 'Hellgate', 'was', 'very', 'unique', 'strange', 'again', 'watchable', 'least', 'once', '80', 'horror', 'films', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'price', 'right', 'double', 'feature', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'price', 'used', 'then', 'buy']",The Pit/Hellgate

832553,A2FPDWTD9AENVK,B0002F6B24,Carl Manes,"[0, 2]","The abysmal FX in this late-80s schlocker attempt to outmatch the terrible script and acting, but the bar has already been set incredibly high. HELLGATE follows a group of friends that are lured into a cursed ghost town by a mysterious woman in white. It isn't long before the town's ghostly inhabitants set in on the intruders. For some inexplicable reason, the dialog is all read phonetically, with every syllable being pronounced in a series of incredibly unnatural performances. Scenes are hilarious when they shouldn't be, and terribly unfunny where they should be. Watching the film on mute may actually have made for a more rewarding viewing experience, where the imagination could make up for the poor writing. On top of everything else, HELLGATE boasts the most unattractive cast this side of MADMAN. The only remotely positive aspects of the film involve some of the most random gore ever filmed (including a mutant zombie turtle) and a series of surreal dream-like sequences in the ghost town that recall the Horror classic CARNIVAL OF SOULS.

Now i got the new dvd and gave it another mature chance, and the result is intresting.First off, the pit was filmed in september thru october of 1979, and it shows. The film also deals with some realistic issues such as, bad parenting, mean adults, bullying, and a hint of child molestation. The film is intresting. The movie goes bad once the babysitter dies. then it goes in another goofy direction and flat out sucks. But the first hour is cool.  Now on the transfer of the dvd is pretty good, colors look a little washed. but the picture is clean .. the audio is good enough.. check it out.there is however one phony thing, everytime someone is thrown into the pit and devoured by the little monsters , no one screams!!!! except the babysitter. but 4 people before her dont scream, at least scream, the director needed to fix this and it would be more frightening and real..  Also, the babysitter has a boyfriend but she two times with his friend, which makes her look shady, after acting to goodie goodie.

832557,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0002F6B24,Jeffrey Leach,"[19, 22]","Once upon a time, a young (but rapidly aging, sadly) schlock film lover by the name of Jeff Leach discovered DVD. And life was good. Then Jeff discovered discs released by an entity named MGM that contained two cheesefests on a single DVD. And life was better. One day, while Jeff rubbed his hands together and cackled with glee over the idea that he could watch two pictures with Shelley Winters--""What's the Matter with Helen?"" and ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"" as an example--in a single day, he heard a voice come down from on high. The voice said in commanding tones, ""You have done well with this discovery, but there is another truth. Go forth and find the double feature Anchor Bay discs. If you thought MGM's discs were schlocky, you haven't seen anything yet."" Jeff wondered at what he had heard. He went forth into the world to find these marvels, suspecting that perhaps the voice was mistaken. What was this madness called Anchor Bay? Who dared attempt to match the marvels wrought by MGM? Infidels! Yet the truth the voice spoke of was exactly that, truth, and Jeff discovered these fabled discs. The truth shall set you free!Free to have your mind filled with images of pure schlock, that is! ""The Pit"" and ""Hellgate"" do indeed fill a single disc in Anchor Bay's ""Drive In"" DVD series. Two films. Three plus hours of cheese. Here we go!""The Pit,"" certainly one of the weirdest films to grace the silver screen, stars helmet haired Sammy Snyders as Jamie Benjamin, a supremely troubled pre-teen who has made a most interesting discovery out in the woods. A pit exists, you see, a pit that contains odd little troll shaped creatures with a hunger for meat. When we first meet up with Jamie, we see him pushing a bully into the pit. Then we get the backstory. Jamie is a problem child, a real weirdo that his teachers and neighbors view with suspicion and alarm. Even his parents worry about him. It makes sense. Jamie carries on conversations with his teddy bear, owns a bunch of slithery reptiles, and has an obsession with girls that would make a porn addict sit up and take notice. Watch what he does to his sultry school librarian in the hope of getting a few cheesecake snapshots! Sick, I tell you, sick! Then there is the attention Jamie heaps on his babysitter Sandy O'Reilly (Jeannie Elias). He watches her while she sleeps, asks really disturbing questions, and leaves messages on the mirror in the bathroom while she takes a shower. Paging David Berkowitz!Flip the disc over and watch ""Hellgate,"" a movie that greatly disappoints when compared to the wacky weirdness of ""The Pit."" Note to self: when you've sunk to watching horror films starring Ron Palillo of ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" fame, it's time to hang up the remote. Yes, ""Hellgate"" stars Horshack as Matt, a graduate student who stumbles over a horrible little amusement park type town with a few of his brain dead friends. What happens? Oh, not much. The owner of the park found some magical crystal that initially turns goldfish into exploding monstrosities, but he manages to master the power of this object and thus resurrect his dead daughter Josie (Abigail Wolcott). His daughter then haunts the roads around the town, luring in travelers for a little bit of lovin' and a whole lotta dyin'! Course, she didn't count on meeting up and falling in love with the hunk o' burnin' love that is Ron Palillo! This unexpected romance leads to all sorts of nonsense, some of which actually involves a bit of violence, but the movie mostly tries to play for laughs. Watch for the hoofers shaking their skirts in the dancehall! Watch for ham-fisted acting and dumb dialogue! Watch that dude spend half the film sharpening objects to challenge the owner of Hellgate only to die immediately when he shows up to do battle!""The Pit"" is by far the better picture on the disc. Snyders is an odd duck made all the odder by a script obviously written by someone who took the brown blotter at Woodstock. We get a little girl calling Jamie a ""funny person"" not once but twice, meat, a teddy bear that commands the living to kill, and some serious gore when the troll like creatures go on a killing spree! Wait, there's more! We get an old lady in a wheelchair dumped in the pit! We get Sandy's boyfriend falling into the pit as though he couldn't possibly have seen a hole in the ground the size of Australia! We get a conclusion taken straight out of the Twilight Zone! Oh yeah! Schlockfest central here, folks! How could a lame movie like ""Hellgate"" compare with such a film? Easy--it can't. Placing these two films side by side is like comparing the intellectual powers of Anna Nicole Smith and Stephen Hawking. Can't be done.Anchor Bay does a nice job with both movies in terms of picture quality. Both are in widescreen. While no one expects anything on these double feature discs in the extras department, we do get a poster and still gallery on ""The Pit."" We get nothing in the way of extras for ""Hellgate"" unless you count the heartache you'll carry with you for days afterwards. After watching the disc, I began wondering about that voice I heard telling me to go and find this DVD. Was it the voice of the Supreme Being, or the voice of Jamie's teddy bear? I'm not sure, but I've got a sudden craving to lure my enemies into a forest in the hopes that I'll find a pit there...",4,Three hours of widescreen schlock!,1129334400,"10 15,

832558,A1OYNQNK3ZM5QB,B0002F6B24,J. Meeley,"[0, 0]","This review is for ""The Pit"" only:Being a fan of both horror and grindhouse films, I've seen more than my share of strange movies. And while I won't go so far as to say ""The Pit"" tops them all, it is certainly high up the totem pole of weirdness.The story revolves around a young boy named Jamie (played by Sammy Snyders), who is an odd sort of kid. Ostracized by the other kids, and even some of the adults, because of his unusual behavior, he finds friendship with his teddy bear (who speaks to him) and a small group of creatures that dwell in a nearby pit. But when he finds out what their diet consists of, all those who haven't been nice to Jamie end up finding themselves on the menu!Almost from the start, the film has a very eerie and creepy tone to it. Jamie's erratic behavior tells you there is something not quite right here. Sammy Snyders really does a superlative job in portraying Jamie as a strange outsider. He's alone in his own little world and he has no problem with it at all. It's all the ""normal people"" who bug him. But when his crush on the babysitter, Sandy (played by Jeannie Elias), is threatened by her seeing him as just a kid and wanting to be with other men, eerie takes a turn into the outlandish. Unfortunately, how that is presented to us isn't always on an even keel. Jamie's luring his ""foes"" to the pit to feed them to his ""friends,"" ranges from the scary (like what he does to the bully and his girlfriend) to the unintentionally hilarious (like how he handles the blind woman in a wheelchair). But for the first two acts, things remain coherent an entertaining, even if a bit rough in the execution. But at the end of the second act, with the death of Sandy, things go completely off the rails.The last act of the film is almost a hodgepodge of situations, that often don't show how they are connected or even make much sense. The police investigating the disappearance of those Jamie has fed to the trolls, is absolutely ridiculous. To call it ""keystone cops work,"" would be to insult incompetent police. Then, Jamie lets the creatures loose, but they don't go far or do very much. The mass slaughter of them is very anti-climactic, to say the least. And the end, where Jamie goes to live with his grandparents and we see his ultimate fate, just comes completely out of left field. What happened to his parents? Why didn't he move with them to Seattle? Was ""Teddy's"" voice only in Jamie's head or was there something else at work? And how many other pits full of these creatures are there? All questions to which we never get the answers. It's like the director just didn't know how to end it, so they just filled the last 20-25 minutes with pointless scenes that go nowhere and have no rhyme or reason. It drags down the film's enjoyment a bit and leaves you with a less than satisfying feeling, even though the rest of it has been interesting and entertaining.As I said, ""The Pit"" is certainly among one of the most peculiar films I've seen, if not the most peculiar. And while the final act is a cluttered and disappointing jumble, the film's first two acts are engaging and it does keep you entertained throughout its 97 minute run time (something you can't say about many other ""normal"" horror films). I'd mildly recommend this for horror fans looking for a less-than-usual experience, due to its off-the-wall style and format. It is certainly one of the most unique specimens in the annals of horror cinema, that I have ever come across.",3,Who wouldn't love a story about a boy and his monsters?,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,3485,"['review', 'Pit', 'only', 'Being', 'fan', 'horror', 'grindhouse', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'share', 'strange', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'Pit', 'certainly', 'high', 'totem', 'pole', 'weirdness.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'young', 'boy', 'named', 'Jamie', 'played', 'Sammy', 'Snyders', 'who', 'odd', 'sort', 'kid', 'Ostracized', 'other', 'kids', 'even', 'adults', 'unusual', 'behavior', 'friendship', 'teddy', 'bear', 'who', 'small', 'group', 'creatures', 'dwell', 'nearby', 'pit', 'when', 'out', 'what', 'diet', 'consists', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'nice', 'Jamie', 'end', 'up', 'finding', 'menu', 'Almost', 'start', 'film', 'very', 'eerie', 'creepy', 'tone', 'Jamie', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'tells', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'here', 'Sammy', 'Snyders', 'really', 'superlative', 'job', 'portraying', 'Jamie', 'strange', 'outsider', 'alone', 'own', 'little', 'world', 'problem', 'normal', 'people', 'who', 'bug', 'when', 'crush', 'babysitter', 'Sandy', 'played', 'Jeannie', 'Elias', 'threatened', 'seeing', 'as', 'just', 'kid', 'wanting', 'be', 'other', 'men', 'eerie', 'turn', 'outlandish', 'Unfortunately', 'how', 'presented', ""n't"", 'always', 'even', 'keel', 'Jamie', 'luring', 'foes', 'pit', 'feed', 'friends', 'scary', 'what', 'bully', 'girlfriend', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'how', 'blind', 'woman', 'wheelchair', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'things', 'remain', 'coherent', 'entertaining', 'even', 'bit', 'rough', 'execution', 'end', 'second', 'act', 'death', 'Sandy', 'things', 'go', 'completely', 'rails.The', 'last', 'act', 'film', 'almost', 'hodgepodge', 'situations', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'show', 'how', 'are', 'connected', 'even', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'police', 'investigating', 'disappearance', 'Jamie', 'fed', 'trolls', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'call', 'keystone', 'cops', 'work', 'would', 'be', 'insult', 'incompetent', 'police', 'Then', 'Jamie', 'creatures', 'loose', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'do', 'very', 'much', 'mass', 'slaughter', 'very', 'anti-climactic', 'say', 'least', 'end', 'where', 'Jamie', 'live', 'grandparents', 'see', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'just', 'completely', 'left', 'field', 'What', 'happened', 'parents', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'Seattle', 'Was', 'Teddy', 'voice', 'only', 'Jamie', 'head', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'work', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'pits', 'full', 'creatures', 'are', 'there', 'questions', 'never', 'get', 'answers', 'director', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'end', 'just', 'filled', 'last', '20-25', 'minutes', 'pointless', 'scenes', 'go', 'nowhere', 'have', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'down', 'film', 'enjoyment', 'bit', 'less', 'satisfying', 'feeling', 'even', 'rest', 'been', 'interesting', 'entertaining.As', 'said', 'Pit', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'peculiar', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'most', 'peculiar', 'final', 'act', 'cluttered', 'disappointing', 'jumble', 'film', 'first', 'two', 'acts', 'are', 'engaging', 'keep', 'entertained', '97', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'about', 'many', 'other', 'normal', 'horror', 'films', ""'d"", 'mildly', 'recommend', 'horror', 'fans', 'looking', 'less-than-usual', 'experience', 'due', 'off-the-wall', 'style', 'format', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'specimens', 'annals', 'horror', 'cinema', 'have', 'ever', 'come']",The Pit/Hellgate

832561,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B0002F6B24,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","This totally random WTF-style horror movie is often intentionally funny and embraces its own campiness with extra cheese.  If you love bad old school horror, then you should embrace this, too.This rather tasteless, tactless schlock flick begins when in 1957 when some bikers kidnap a local young beauty named Josie and bring her to the town of Hellgate.  Things get out of hand during a rape-y game of cat and mouse and Josie is accidentally killed.  Josie's bereft father comes across some dumb magical glowy crystal which reanimates the dead and turns goldfish and sea turtles into giant mutant zombie monsters that explode.With his newfound powers of resurrection, he brings his daughter back as a slutty well-preserved zombie that lures men to Hellgate to enjoy...ummmm...her.  The down side is that now you have to meet her father, who looks a bit like Dr. Doom with chunks of metal on his face and a metal arm--evidently replacement parts for injuries suffered from his exploding reanimated zombie pets.  Dad gets homicidal whenever Josie drops her top.Well after 37 years of her slutty antics, Josie meets Matt (Ron Palillo; Friday the 13th Part VI), takes him home, drops her top and decides that she really likes him.  So she keeps her dad at bay while he makes his escape.  But Matt decides to return for Josie and brings his buddy and their girlfriends.  Why he'd bring his girlfriend with him to get together with an even hotter girl is beyond me.  Now furious with Matt's return, dad raises all of the dead in the local cemetery as zombies to take care of him.Needless to say, the acting hurts.  But the cast makes up for it with loads tasteless nudity to remind us that they clearly weren't hired for their gifts for dialogue.There were some fine attempts at gore including some dismemberment.  There were also some very cheesy gore scenes including a lame strangulation.  Other special effects include such highlights as a rubber bat being shaken from fishing line (that we can see), crystals that shoot lasers, and coloring a bodybuilder's hair gray as the sole effort to make him look 37 years older (since he was in the 1957 scene).This movie is often intentionally funny and embraces its own campiness with extra cheese.

I mean, c'mon, we can't take it THAT seriously, and on that level, it works! It's not everyone's type of story, but &#34;The Pit&#34; is blackly humorous and unusual, and that goes a long way for me, as it never really stoops to slasher movie or monster movie clich&eacute;s. It is, albeit, rather hastily resolved, with a twist ending that is superfluous--I mean, really, what are the odds that the little girl has...oh never mind.&#34;Hellgate&#34; has been termed unwatchable by some reviewers here, but I don't know that that's entirely true.

832567,AT7W1EXT0PF2Y,B0002F6B24,The Patriarch,"[1, 2]","Why is this movie such a pile of crap? Because it had so much potential. Any fan of B horror movies would be intrigued by the premise: A boy with a crush on his babysitter leads people into a pit filled with flesh eating creatures under the direction of his talking teddy bear. What B movie fan wouldn't rush out to hunt this baby down? However, what we're given is such a boring and uneventful waste of time it's a total let down.First we start with a clip of the movie that happens later on. What movie has this ever worked successfully in? It's like when a novel has a random page from later on in the book at the very beginning. What's the point? Why would I care what happens near the end when I don't even know who the characters are yet? So this movie is a lot like that, only worse because it's a movie and a bad one at that. It's not even different footage or camera angles, it's just the same exact footage tacked on at the beginning. It looks completely out of place because there's not any opening credits, or even a black screen with: S**t films Presents..."" Nope, it just throws you into this thing completely unprepared.Another faux pas of this egregiously bad film is that fact that instead of the murders taking place throughout the movie, they happen all at once in a time-frame of about ten minutes. There's no suspense, surprise, or ingenuity in any way. And because this happens near the end of the film, most of the movie is boring dialogue and by the time of the murders we don't even care anymore.So without further ado I'll provide my usual synopsis of this film to prevent you from having to see it if you're only mildly interested. So let's start this piece of crap shall we?Now as I said, it starts with part of the movie from later on. A birthday party to be exact. And within the first minute of this flash-forward we have a short flashback to make things even more confusing. The first thing you'll immediately notice is the bad acting. The one boy's voice sounds like he's doing an imitation of a cartoon dog. So to get to the point, Jamie, the anti-hero of this movie leads a boy and girl that pick on him into the pit where they are devoured. Of course we don't see them being devoured, just being pushed into the pit.Finally we have the credit sequence which should have taken place 3 minutes ago. At least the movie has a cool theme song, but the only problem is it's the only song. I understand this movie is low budget, but even the no-budget movie Manos: the Hands of Fate had a full soundtrack! So now we're in detention, for whatever reason, where Jamie is being punished for something and it seems he cut out some naked chick from a library book. His teacher claims the librarian will ""find a way to repair it."" How the heck do you 'repair' a book with something cut out of it? And why does the library have nudie books in it anyway! Even if they are classified as ""art?""Jamie is completely unlikable and does nothing but play stupid pranks on people. Of course, Jamie seems to be hated by everyone, even before they know him! His mom talks to his new baby sitter and we have the same flashback from earlier on. We're only 7 min. into this and they've shown the same flashback twice.After a longwinded discussion with the babysitter, Jamie's parents finally leave. Jamie immediately takes the opportunity to hit on his new caregiver. Good luck, Jamie, I've dealt with ice-princesses like her before. She's even some kind of feminist as she won't let Jamie help her out.  Jamie confides in his Teddy Bear about all this. Teddy seems to think she's hot too so he encourages Jamie to go for it. Teddy gets the idea to peek on her while she's undressed in the bathroom. I could have used a Teddy of my own when I was his age.After some peeping-Tom shenanigans, Jamie tells his babysitter about the things in the pit. He calls them Tra-la-logs. They're supposed to be Troglodytes I guess, or some other missing link in evolution mythology. So Jamie goes to visit the Tra-la-logs and he attempts to hold an actual conversation with them. He introduces himself to them as ""The boy with the terrarium at home."" Wow, isn't he special?So yeah, that's the meat of this film. Jamie and the babysitter hanging around talking. They're pretty much the only two major characters in the whole movie. I guess you can count Teddy as number 3. Jamie also has a couple confrontations with the girl next door to help break the monotony.We're deeply entrenched in Act 2 now and still nothing has happened. Jamie for some reason gets the idea to try and feed the Tra-la-logs. When candy doesn't work he tries meat which they really like. We don't really get to see the Tra-la-logs up close, but they kind of look like midgets underneath hair-covered carpets. So Jamie has to go around finding money to buy meat for the them and...why am I watching this? Seriously, I'm watching Jamie buying meat from a butcher shop now. This isn't entertaining! This is boring and uneventful! At least Teddy chimes in and makes things a little entertaining from time to time. Teddy's a frikkin stuffed bear and he's the best character in this film!So Jamie does some more peeping-Tom hijinx and tricks the librarian into taking her top off while he takes a couple Polaroids. Teddy exclaims, ""I'm going to look at these a lot."" Man that is one deranged Teddy!We finally reach the part of the film where Jamie begins to feed his neighbors to the Tra-la-logs. It's kinda strange though because there's like cartoon music that plays in the background. This part just speeds on by as Jamie kills them all off in rapid succession. Then we come to the part of the movie that started out this film fiasco, the part with the party and the boy and girl he tricks into falling into the pit. But what's the point of watching it? I mean, we've already seen it once.That pretty much ends this movie. He kills a couple more people, and there's the obligatory ironic ending. Pretty standard stuff. To sum things up, this film is just one big let down. I felt like I was keeping down vomit the whole time while watching it. It has that icky 70s feel throughout it that really sets you off your food.The crap icing on this piece of garbage DVD is that fact that they tack on another movie, He11gate, to make it seem like, ""Oh, well this movie was crap, but maybe this second feature will be good."" Then it turns out the extra movie is even worse than the first. At least the Pit had a cool premise, He11gate doesn't seem to have a premise at all. I couldn't even sit through the thing, so I kept it on in the back ground while I got some work done. I don't remember anything happening.",3,It's the pits!,1198281600,"12 22, 2007",2007,6669,"['Why', 'movie', 'pile', 'crap', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'fan', 'B', 'horror', 'movies', 'would',

832568,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B0002F6B24,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[9, 11]","I would love to know what committee at Anchor Bay Entertainment sits down and decides on what movies they will release and why.  With that being stated, this double movie feature from the horror vault of Anchor Bay is awesome.  There are two cult classics here that are both great for the horror/campy/strange/atypical lover in you!The movies are as follows:THE PIT (1981) is about a boy twelve years of age named Jamie Benjamin who looks like a younger version of Beck (two turn tables and a microphone).  It is safe to proclaim Jamie is a bit eccentric to say the very least.  Jamie is the victim of jokes and ridiculed by peers and adults.  Also he doesn't have any friends, except for his good pal Teddy, who just happens to be a ""Teddy Bear"".  Unlike other plush animals, Teddy is able to talk to Jamie via telepathy.  Teddy makes many suggestions to Jamie about how to ""approach things"" in life, the advice isn't always pro-social.  Jamie also knows about a strange pit in the woods near his house where four to five trolls live.  Jamie also has a strange obsession with sex, which he tries to display with his babysitter.  Once Jamie is pushed to his limit, which isn't that far of a trip, he figures out the perfect form of revenge for everyone that has ever made a fool out of him.The Pit is hands down one of the most bizarre, peculiar, disturbing and creepy movies I have ever seen.  I wouldn't say it is scary, just weird and eerie.  It is all the elements together that make it so odd: trolls, talking teddy bear, Jamie's behaviors, ghosts, characters who almost seem moot and the jovial music played throughout the film that really doesn't fit.  The movie itself almost seems like a mixture of an after school special + Grimm's fairy tale + fable + rejects Muppets, no jiving.  This motion picture should be watched just for the ""I can't believe what I am watching aspect"".  Overall, The Pit is a cult classic that will make the viewer ask, ""Where did the inspiration for this come from""?HELLGATE (1980) is about three friends telling ghost stories/legends in a log cable while they wait for their friend Matt.  The ghost story/legend that sticks out is about a tourist attraction town called Hellgate that closed down thirty years prior.  This happened when the owner of Hellgate (who is a diet John Astin) watched his daughter being murdered by a biker gang.  The legend states that this tourist attraction is now haunted and it is taboo to go there now.  Hellgate is only several miles from where the friends are staying.  Meanwhile, Matt is on his way to meet his friends when he sees an arcane and beautiful girl walking along the road named Josie.  The interesting factor is that Josie is the owner of Hellgate's daughter who was killed many years ago.  Josie has this Tori Amos thing going on about her and seems very pale when Matt picks her up in his car.  So Tori, I mean Josie brings Matt back to Hellgate and tries to lure him with sex.  To make a long story short, Matt leaves Hellgate without Josie and meets up with his friends.  Matt and his friends then go back to save Josie, rather Matt wants to and his friends are just there for the cheap thrill.  Will Matt and his friends make it out of the haunted town of Hellgate or not?  Will Josie come with them or not?  Is Tori, I mean Josie good or evil?Hellgate is very cheesy and has a wonderful B movie quality about it.  I was laughing out loud at some of the special effects and loop holes in plot that were so big ""you can fly a spaceship through"".  There are zombies in this movie which is almost always a positive in any horror movie, in Hellgate it is definitely a good thing.  I wouldn't say this movie is scary, but there are some creepy moments due to some lighting and situations. The characters are all pretty much flat and one dimensional.  Consequently, that is alright since I was expecting anything wonderful in the ""character development"" department when I was watching this movie.  Overall, a nice little horror flick that gives you a bit of everything: zombies, blood, nudity, interesting scenery and a zombie turtle (don't ask).The DVD itself is dual sided and the only special features are a poster/still gallery for THE PIT, there is no special features for HELLGATE.  Out of the two movies, THE PIT is definitely more unique, but HELLGATE will provide wonderful entertainment.  I found this to be a wonderful investment in the DVD department and see myself watching both of these movies again.  I am glad Anchor Bay is able to restore these lost gems and present them to a whole new generation of viewers.",5,"Two cult classic gems, one DVD",1186358400,"08 6, 2007",2007,4608,"['would', 'love', 'know', 'what', 'committee', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Entertainment', 'down', 'decides', 'movies', 'will', 'release', 'why', 'being', 'stated', 'double', 'movie', 'feature', 'horror', 'vault', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'awesome', 'are', 'two', 'cult', 'classics', 'here', 'are', 'great', 'horror/campy/strange/atypical', 'lover', 'movies', 'are', 'PIT', '1981', 'boy', 'twelve', 'years', 'age', 'named', 'Jamie', 'Benjamin', 'who', 'younger', 'version', 'Beck', 'two', 'turn', 'tables', 'microphone', 'safe', 'proclaim', 'Jamie', 'bit', 'eccentric', 'say', 'very', 'least', 'Jamie', 'victim', 'jokes', 'ridiculed', 'peers', 'adults', 'Also', ""n't"", 'have', 'friends', 'good', 'pal', 'Teddy', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'Teddy', 'Bear', 'other', 'plush', 'animals', 'Teddy', 'able', 'talk', 'Jamie', 'telepathy', 'Teddy', 'many', 'suggestions', 'Jamie', 'how', 'approach', 'things', 'life', 'advice', ""n't"", 'always', 'pro-social', 'Jamie', 'also', 'strange', 'pit', 'woods', 'house', 'where', 'four', 'five', 'trolls', 'live', 'Jamie', 'also', 'strange', 'obsession', 'sex', 'display', 'babysitter', 'Once', 'Jamie', 'pushed', 'limit', ""n't"", 'far', 'trip', 'out', 'perfect', 'form', 'revenge', 'everyone', 'ever', 'made', 'fool', 'him.The', 'Pit', 'hands', 'down', 'one', 'most', 'bizarre', 'peculiar', 'disturbing', 'creepy', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'scary', 'just', 'weird', 'eerie', 'elements', 'together', 'make', 'so', 'odd', 'trolls', 'talking', 'teddy', 'bear', 'Jamie', 'behaviors', 'ghosts', 'characters', 'who', 'almost', 'seem', 'moot', 'jovial', 'music', 'played', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'fit', 'movie', 'almost', 'mixture', 'school', 'special', '+', 'Grimm', 'fairy', 'tale', '+', 'fable', '+', 'rejects', 'Muppets', 'jiving', 'motion', 'picture', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'am', 'watching', 'aspect', 'Overall', 'Pit', 'cult', 'classic', 'will', 'make', 'viewer', 'ask', 'Where', 'did', 'inspiration', 'come', 'HELLGATE', '1980', 'three', 'friends', 'telling', 'ghost', 'stories/legends', 'log', 'cable', 'wait', 'friend', 'Matt', 'ghost', 'story/legend', 'sticks', 'out', 'tourist', 'attraction', 'town', 'called', 'Hellgate', 'closed', 'down', 'thirty', 'years', 'prior', 'happened', 'when', 'owner', 'Hellgate', 'who', 'diet', 'John', 'Astin', 'watched', 'daughter', 'being', 'murdered', 'biker', 'gang', 'legend', 'tourist', 'attraction', 'now', 'haunted', 'taboo', 'go', 'there', 'now', 'Hellgate', 'only', 'several', 'miles', 'where', 'friends', 'are', 'staying', 'Meanwhile', 'Matt', 'way', 'meet', 'friends', 'when', 'arcane', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'walking', 'road', 'named', 'Josie', 'interesting', 'factor', 'Josie', 'owner', 'Hellgate', 'daughter', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Josie', 'Tori', 'Amos', 'thing', 'going', 'very', 'pale', 'when', 'Matt', 'up', 'car', 'So', 'Tori', 'mean', 'Josie', 'Matt', 'back', 'Hellgate', 'tries', 'lure', 'sex', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'Matt', 'Hellgate', 'Josie', 'up', 'friends', 'Matt', 'friends', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'save', 'Josie', 'rather', 'Matt', 'friends', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'cheap', 'thrill', 'Will', 'Matt', 'friends', 'make', 'haunted', 'town', 'Hellgate', 'not', 'Will', 'Josie', 'come', 'not', 'Tori', 'mean', 'Josie', 'good', 'evil', 'Hellgate', 'very', 'cheesy', 'wonderful', 'B', 'movie', 'quality', 'was', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'special', 'effects', 'loop', 'holes', 'plot', 'were', 'so', 'big', 'can', 'fly', 'spaceship', 'are', 'zombies', 'movie', 'almost', 'always', 'positive', 'horror', 'movie', 'Hellgate', 'definitely', 'good', 'thing', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'movie', 'scary', 'are', 'creepy', 'moments', 'due', 'lighting', 'situations', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'flat', 'one', 'dimensional', 'Consequently', 'alright', 'was', 'expecting', 'anything', 'wonderful', 'character', 'development', 'department', 'when', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'Overall', 'nice', 'little', 'horror', 'flick', 'bit', 'everything', 'zombies', 'blood', 'nudity', 'interesting', 'scenery', 'zombie', 'turtle', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', '.The', 'DVD', 'dual', 'sided', 'only', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'poster/still', 'gallery', 'THE', 'PIT', 'special', 'features', 'HELLGATE', 'two', 'movies', 'THE', 'PIT', 'definitely', 'more', 'unique', 'HELLGATE', 'will', 'provide', 'wonderful', 'entertainment', 'found', 'be', 'wonderful', 'investment', 'DVD', 'department', 'see', 'watching', 'movies', 'again', 'am', 'glad', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'able', 'restore', 'lost', 'gems', 'present', 'whole', 'new', 'generation', 'viewers']",The Pit/Hellgate
