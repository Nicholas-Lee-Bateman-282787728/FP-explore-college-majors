1204704,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B001IXXYD8,Amit Talpade,"[0, 1]","If you are not familiar with Russell Peters, he is a Canadian of Indian ancestry. So much of the material in his stand up routines highlights traits and peculiarities about Indian people. He puts funny twists to everyday happenings in the life of an Indian. His jokes also attack other races, especially Chinese. During this routine he directs his comedy on an audience member who has to leave the auditorium for some reason, a funny bit which made you squirm at her plight.  Although I enjoyed Comedy Now starring Peter Russell more, this is not a bad effort. I never had a chance to see the extras but I will at a later date. I gave this show 3 stars 121509",3,Good in parts....,1260835200,"12 15, 2009",2009,659,"['are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Russell', 'Peters', 'Canadian', 'Indian', 'ancestry', 'So', 'much', 'material', 'stand', 'up', 'routines', 'highlights', 'traits', 'peculiarities', 'Indian', 'people', 'funny', 'twists', 'everyday', 'happenings', 'life', 'Indian', 'jokes', 'also', 'attack', 'other', 'races', 'especially', 'Chinese', 'routine', 'comedy', 'audience', 'member', 'who', 'leave', 'auditorium', 'reason', 'funny', 'bit', 'made', 'squirm', 'plight', 'enjoyed', 'Comedy', 'Now', 'starring', 'Peter', 'Russell', 'more', 'not', 'bad', 'effort', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'extras', 'will', 'later', 'date', 'gave', 'show', '3', 'stars', '121509']","Red, White and Brown"

1204706,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001IXXYD8,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[17, 19]","Gut-bursting, pee-in-your pants comedy!  It's that hilarious, enjoyable and extremely funny!  Russell Peters is unleashed in `Red, White & Brown'.  One of the top comedians right now and he truly delivers with his latest DVD release!The Canadian stand-up comic won people over with his Comedy Central special ""Russell Peters: Outsourced"" back in 2006 and now the guy is just red hot!His latest DVD release ""Red, White and Brown"" was recorded live at a sold-out audience at the WaMu Theater at Madison Square Garden and features material from his ""HOMECOMING TOUR"" and features 20 additional minutes not shown on the Comedy Central broadcast and also includes a full-length CD of the performance.Featured on the DVD are the following segments:1. Mele Mel Intro2. DDR3. Blame the Media4. Cheap Indians Pt. 25. Louis Vuitton6. Race vs. Culture7. West Indians8. Body Hair9. World Cup10. Deaf People11. CreditsNo one is spared in the audience.  People in the audience of different ethnicity will be picked and utilized into his comedy routine as well as anyone in the audience.  May it be the woman who gets up to go to the bathroom, to the man who brought his child to the performance, Russell Peters has a competent flow of comedy in which the pacing on the DVD is full of non-stop fun, one joke after the other and no pausing of laughter. Peter's comedy delivery, facial expressions of his comedy routine was done very well.The accompany CD features the performance but where the DVD is about 1 hr. and 19 minutes, the CD is about 57 minutes long.  So, more or less, the Comedy Central edited performance is probably what is featured on the CD and I've already listened to it several times.  It's a very good comedy CD and even without the visuals of the DVD, the jokes are just as funny and hearing the audience laughing, gasping and cheering at each joke is heard clearly.Overall, ""Red, White and Brown"" is an enjoyable,  fun and fantastic performance.  Russell Peters was on top of his game that night and it showed.  You can't help but laugh at his comedy!VIDEO & AUDIO:Part of what makes a comedy performance on DVD work effectively is to show the audience and ""Red, White and Brown"" definitely has a good number of cameras to get close ups of reactions to closeups of the people that Peters targets for his jokes and a good angles from different parts of the venue and of course close up of Peters.  Editing was done really well and thus you get good cuts of Peters and then various audience reaction.The lighting was done really well inside the venue and overall a very good choice for venue for the performance.As for the audio, the audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround and English Stereo.  You can clearly hear Peters and the audience laughing and gasping, clapping at the jokes.SPECIAL FEATURES:There are a good number of special features included on this release.  Included are:* Featurette: White Jacket Bootleg  - This segment features about 10 minutes of comedy focusing on ""Women are Thinkers"" and ""David and Vickey"".  Both have optional commentary featuring Russell Peters, Clayton Peters and Director Jigar Talati.  I have to say that the segment on ""David and Vickey"" was just hilarious.  Two co-workers come to watch the show and Peters was just relentless in using these two in his bit.  Well-done!* Featurette: Support the Troops - This features comedy on the ""USS Eisenhower"" and ""Saddam's Bitches in a Building"" (with optional commentary featuring Russell Peters, Clayton Peters and Director Jigar Talati).* Deleted Scenes: This feature scenes that were deleted from the extended play of ""Red, White and Brown"" but nevertheless, these additional scenes are equally as funny.Additional Scenes: Filipino MomAdditional Scenes: Indians and FilipinosAdditional Scenes: Ethnic PhotosAdditional Scenes: Arab-A-PhobiaI was definitely pleased with Russell Peters ""Red, White and Brown"", his ability to continuously showcase joke after joke, incorporate the audience into his comedy routine quickly, no pausing just a smooth flow of comedy.Again this comedy is no holds barred, Chinese, Indians, Jewish, African-American, Latino, Filipino, Italians, etc.  Peters goes all out and overall, manages to have one well-done performance on DVD and also on CD.As mentioned, a good comedy DVD needs to have good editing, good lighting, audience participation and a various camera angles and everything else to work well.  In this case, the venue, editing, the various camera angles and audience participation was perfect.  Sound is clear on both the DVD and CD and you can't ask for anything more.  On the DVD, you get a good number of special features and the optional commentary for the featurettes as well.I have no doubt in my mind that we will see more of Russell Peters in the near future.  The man is one of the top comedians in North America right now and watching this... joke after joke and the way he presented it, everything worked on this DVD.  Hilarious, no holds barred comedy at its best!So, you're definitely going to get your money's worth for this DVD release.  Russell Peter's ""Red, White and Brown"" is highly recommended!",5,"Gut-bursting, pee-in-your pants comedy!

Viewing the video a couple of times did not diminish how funny this comic genius it!.  I guess my ""mind was blasted.""  Peters knows how to play the audience well and things that happen in the audience only seemed to add to the jokes without any letup in the pace.  Russell is a master of capturing different ethnic accents and no matter who he picked on, it seemed that those people laughed out loud.Now I know that an Indian ghost is not scary and that there are different levels of cheapness among ethnicities.  There is about 40 minutes of bonus features including routines from different shows, Russell taking a military plane to an aircraft carrier and scenes from his upcoming documentary.
