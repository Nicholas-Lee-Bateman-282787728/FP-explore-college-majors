Unless you've seen the zombie/alien movie ""Undead"" the plots are similiar, a comet that contains some deadly parisite that ends up turning people into zombies, but in this the parisites are using Men as ther reproducing vesil(trust me you dont want to know).  The Back of the dvd hypes this movie almost as much as ""Zombie Diaries"", the back says ""2 billions zombies and only 11 survivors"" Im thinking ""SWEET!!!! THERES GOING TO BE AN ALL OUT BATTLE!!!"" Its nothing like that, I must say the acting was better than I thought it would be, and there were some funny lines.  But instead of having a large amount of extras as Zombies theres about 50 if that. Some they just half-assed it, if you push pause on some scenes, there we little if any make-up on some people.  Just people making stupid faces, some scenes I could have done without, theres a few scenes where the survivors are investigating why the Genitals are fall off of the infected men..............

1114159,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000XFVIOO,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 0]","Well, it's different - you have to give Days of Darkness that much.  The zombies on display here may look like your basic stereotypical zombies, but they aren't - just trust me on that.  These zombies aren't going to scare anybody, but they're more than capable of eliciting a few ""yuck"" reactions from viewers - and that turns out to be the film's saving grace.  The first half of Days of Darkness is a train wreck in the making, but writer/director Jake Kennedy eventually manages to pull the whole story from the very brink of bad movie infamy.  I'm not saying this is a great zombie movie, but it does succeed in hollowing out a nice little niche for itself in the genre - which is quite a feat, in my opinion.  The shear weirdness of the story makes Days of Darkness worth watching.Days of Darkness stumbles badly out of the gate, making the viewer feel as if he/she must have missed a major scene or two at the beginning.  After camping out atop a remote hill somewhere, a young couple wake up to find their car covered in a strange dust, and then before you can say ""Bob's your uncle,"" they're being attacked by zombies.  Suddenly, a stranger shows up, starts bashing zombies left and right, and then leads our young lovers to a survival headquarters at an abandoned microwave station house of some kind.  There, they meet up with quite a collection of characters.  Besides your basic stereotypical characters (""bully with a gun"" fellow, ""preacher man"" guy, the ""tough chick""), there's also a quite outspoken former adult movie actress and her teenaged virgin daughter.  Naturally, they all spend a lot of time arguing about what to do.  At this point, about a third of the way through the film as a whole, I must admit I was not thinking kind thoughts about Days of Darkness.  Not only were the characters ignoring the heck out of me, I was still waiting for an explanation as to what set the zombie apocalypse in motion.  (Actually - having read the plot summary - I knew it started with the crash or near collision of a comet with Earth, but I was still expecting a little elaboration on the subject.)Finally, at about the midpoint of the movie, things finally got a little more interesting.  Some really unusual - and pretty nasty - things happen to the bodies of these zombies, things that made me say ""That is just wrong"" more than once.  And it's not just the zombies - really weird things are happening to some of the survivors, as well.  This definitely ain't George Romero's dawn, day, or night of the living dead.  Be prepared for a lot of bickering among the survivors, especially early on before their numbers start dwindling.  Slogging through it won't be easy, but it will all be worth it once you reach the point where the examination of dead zombie bodies begins.I have to subtract some points for all of the ""this movie sucks"" moments early on, but even a day after watching Days of Darkness I have to admit that I actually sort of enjoyed the overall experience.  Say what you will about the dialogue and plot (and, in all honesty, there's plenty to say about both), but you have to give writer/director Jake Kennedy some credit for daring to make a different kind of zombie film.",3,Oddly appealing despite a plethora of problems,1242086400,"05 12, 2009",2009,3206,"['Well', 'different', 'have', 'give', 'Days', 'Darkness', 'much', 'zombies', 'display', 'here', 'may', 'look', 'basic', 'stereotypical', 'zombies', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'trust', 'zombies', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'scare', 'anybody', ""'re"", 'more', 'capable', 'eliciting', 'few', 'yuck', 'reactions', 'viewers', 'out', 'be', 'film', 'saving', 'grace', 'first', 'half', 'Days', 'Darkness', 'train', 'wreck', 'making', 'writer/director', 'Jake', 'Kennedy', 'eventually', 'pull', 'whole', 'story', 'very', 'brink', 'bad', 'movie', 'infamy', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'great', 'zombie', 'movie', 'succeed', 'hollowing', 'out', 'nice', 'little', 'niche', 'genre', 'quite', 'feat', 'opinion', 'shear', 'weirdness', 'story', 'Days', 'Darkness', 'worth', 'watching.Days', 'Darkness', 'stumbles', 'badly', 'gate', 'making', 'viewer', 'feel', 'he/she', 'must', 'have', 'missed', 'major', 'scene', 'two', 'beginning', 'camping', 'out', 'remote', 'hill', 'somewhere', 'young', 'couple', 'wake', 'up', 'find', 'car', 'covered', 'strange', 'dust', 'then', 'can', 'say', 'Bob', 'uncle', ""'re"", 'being', 'attacked', 'zombies', 'Suddenly', 'stranger', 'up', 'bashing', 'zombies', 'left', 'right', 'then', 'young', 'lovers', 'survival', 'headquarters', 'abandoned', 'microwave', 'station', 'house', 'kind', 'meet', 'up', 'quite', 'collection', 'characters', 'basic', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'bully', 'gun', 'fellow', 'preacher', 'man', 'guy', 'tough', 'chick', 'also', 'quite', 'outspoken', 'former', 'adult', 'movie', 'actress', 'teenaged', 'virgin', 'daughter', 'Naturally', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'arguing', 'what', 'do', 'point', 'third', 'way', 'film', 'whole', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'not', 'thinking', 'kind', 'thoughts', 'Days', 'Darkness', 'Not', 'only', 'were', 'characters', 'ignoring', 'heck', 'was', 'still', 'waiting', 'explanation', 'what', 'set', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'motion', 'Actually', 'having', 'read', 'plot', 'summary', 'knew', 'started', 'crash', 'collision', 'comet', 'Earth', 'was', 'still', 'expecting', 'little', 'elaboration', 'subject', 'Finally', 'midpoint', 'movie', 'things', 'finally', 'got', 'little', 'more', 'interesting', 'really', 'unusual', 'pretty', 'nasty', 'things', 'happen', 'bodies', 'zombies', 'things', 'made', 'say', 'just', 'wrong', 'more', 'once', 'not', 'just', 'zombies', 'really', 'weird', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'survivors', 'as', 'well', 'definitely', 'ai', ""n't"", 'George', 'Romero', 'dawn', 'day', 'night', 'living', 'dead', 'Be', 'prepared', 'lot', 'bickering', 'survivors', 'especially', 'early', 'numbers', 'start', 'dwindling', 'Slogging', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'easy', 'will', 'all', 'be', 'once', 'reach', 'point', 'where', 'examination', 'dead', 'zombie', 'bodies', 'begins.I', 'have', 'subtract', 'points', 'movie', 'moments', 'early', 'even', 'day', 'watching', 'Days', 'Darkness', 'have', 'admit', 'actually', 'sort', 'enjoyed', 'overall', 'experience', 'Say', 'what', 'will', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'honesty', 'plenty', 'say', 'have', 'give', 'writer/director', 'Jake', 'Kennedy', 'credit', 'daring', 'make', 'different', 'kind', 'zombie', 'film']",Days Of Darkness

1114161,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B000XFVIOO,Howard M. Kindel,"[0, 0]","I'm beginning to think that so-called ""Zombie Movie Fans"" merely make that claim to give credence to their penchant for panning every movie they come across.  I grant that there really is such a thing as a ""Golden Age"" of zombie movies; and that virtually everything that's come after - save the first wave of zombie comedies - is mostly a poor copy of, say, Romero's or Bava's or one of the other masters of the genre's ground-breaking work (although even Romero failed to make the grade among zombie fans with his latest - and far more original - entires).  Consequently, I long ago stopped asking if such and such a new zombie movie is as good as ""Night Of The Living Dead"" or ""Demons.""  And guess what happened?  By not trying to make ridiculous comparisons to the masters' works, I was able to appreciate each new entry on its own merits.""Days Of Darkness"" is a good zombie movie, with a unique take on how it all came about.  In fact, it's one of the few zombie movies that actually dissects how these flesh-eating mutants came to be.  True, we don't really need to know that in order to enjoy the film; but it's not entirely irrelevant. Nor is the acting anywhere near as bad as some reviewers insist.  I mean, come on: zombie movies are not Shakespeare or Ibsen or Chekhov.  What level of acting would you expect from characters whose entire reason-for-being is to keep from being eaten?  How do you think real people would react if being hunted by an army of zombies?  Would they go into a Hamlet-like soliloquy or rage like King Lear against the unfairness of it all?  Of course some actors just happen to be first-rate - like Woody Harrelson.  But I seriously doubt if this film's budget could have induced Harrelson to join the cast.Bottom line: take the movie you're watching at face value.  This one held my attention and kept me guessing who would survive and who wouldn't.  That's enough for me to enjoy the movie. If it's first rate I want, I'll watch an adaptation of a Thomas Hardy work.  But if it's merely entertainment, something like ""Days Of Darkness"" fills the bill just fine.Oh, one last thing: most reviewers who pan these lesser zombie movies like to think of Sam Raimi as the real master of the entire horror genre.  Well, I don't.  To me, his ""Evil Dead"" series doesn't hold a candle to Romero or Bava at their best.",5,When Enough Is Not Enough,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,2346,"[""'m"", 'beginning', 'think', 'so-called', 'Zombie', 'Movie', 'Fans', 'merely', 'make', 'claim', 'give', 'credence', 'penchant', 'panning', 'movie', 'come', 'grant', 'really', 'such', 'thing', 'Golden', 'Age', 'zombie', 'movies', 'virtually', 'everything', 'come', 'save', 'first', 'wave', 'zombie', 'comedies', 'mostly', 'poor', 'copy', 'say', 'Romero', 'Bava', 'one', 'other', 'masters', 'genre', 'ground-breaking', 'work', 'even', 'Romero', 'failed', 'make', 'grade', 'zombie', 'fans', 'latest', 'far', 'more', 'original', 'entires', 'Consequently', 'long', 'ago', 'stopped', 'asking', 'such', 'new', 'zombie', 'movie', 'as', 'good', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Demons', 'guess', 'what', 'happened', 'not', 'trying', 'make', 'ridiculous', 'comparisons', 'masters', 'works', 'was', 'able', 'appreciate', 'new', 'entry', 'own', 'merits', 'Days', 'Darkness', 'good', 'zombie', 'movie', 'unique', 'take', 'how', 'came', 'about', 'fact', 'one', 'few', 'zombie', 'movies', 'actually', 'how', 'flesh-eating', 'mutants', 'came', 'be', 'True', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'know', 'order', 'enjoy', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'irrelevant', 'acting', 'anywhere', 'as', 'bad', 'reviewers', 'insist', 'mean', 'come', 'zombie', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'Shakespeare', 'Ibsen', 'Chekhov', 'What', 'level', 'acting', 'would', 'expect', 'characters', 'entire', 'reason-for-being', 'keep', 'being', 'eaten', 'How', 'do', 'think', 'real', 'people', 'would', 'react', 'being', 'hunted', 'army', 'zombies', 'Would', 'go', 'Hamlet-like', 'soliloquy', 'rage', 'King', 'Lear', 'unfairness', 'course', 'actors', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'first-rate', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'film', 'budget', 'could', 'have', 'induced', 'Harrelson', 'join', 'cast.Bottom', 'line', 'take', 'movie', ""'re"", 'watching', 'face', 'value', 'one', 'held', 'attention', 'kept', 'guessing', 'who', 'would', 'survive', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'enough', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'first', 'rate', 'want', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'adaptation', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'work', 'merely', 'entertainment', 'something', 'Days', 'Darkness', 'bill', 'just', 'fine.Oh', 'one', 'last', 'thing', 'most', 'reviewers', 'who', 'pan', 'lesser', 'zombie', 'movies', 'think', 'Sam', 'Raimi', 'real', 'master', 'entire', 'horror', 'genre', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'Evil', 'Dead', 'series', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'Romero', 'Bava', 'best']",Days Of Darkness

1114169,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000XFVIOO,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","Days of Darkness (Jake Kennedy, 2007)The tagline for this flick is ""2 billion zombies. 11 humans. Get ready to rumble."" That should probably clue you in to the fact that you're not supposed to take this movie seriously. Yet it seems a lot of people did, and I'm not entirely sure why. Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that this movie, thanks to its stars--Tom Eplin and Sabrina Gennarino, both of whom have appeared in soap operas in the recent past--attracted a crowd to this movie who may not be used to horror movies, and certainly not to low-budget ones made by people enough in love with the genre that the movie is peppered with in-jokes. To be fair, there are some movies like this that attract the non-horror crowd successfully (okay, I can only think of one, Final Destination), but really, flicks like this are made by horror fans for horror fans. I realize I should take points off for that sort of thing when I'm reviewing a movie, but you know, I had an awful lot of fun with this movie, and I'm inclined to simply take it for what it is, which is a slight, shallow, incredibly fun zombie flick with a really, really warped sense of humor. In other words, a movie that was pretty much tailor-made for me.It even starts off with one of my favorite conceits--the world goes to hell while the protagonists aren't looking. Steve (TV character actor Travis Brorsen) and Mimi (Roshelle Pattison from the forthcoming, and highly-anticipated, Child Reduction Act) are up on a mountain high above the city camping. They fall asleep, wake up until the next morning, and pow. What happened during the night? The opening credits lead me to believe it had something to do with a weird blue meteor, but I'm not entirely sure. Not that it matters. We see the result, and that's enough. The result: everyone in the world (well, except nine others, as you can tell from the tagline) has become the living dead. Of course, these two hook up with the other nine after getting saved from their first zombie attack. You've seen these archetypes in many a zombie film before, most transparently in Romero's Day of the Dead; there's the militaristic folks who want to blow everything up, the curious scientific types, those who just want to curl up in a little ball until it all goes away, etc. As with all good zombie movies, the zombies themselves are usually backdrop, and the real action of the film centers on the interactions between the survivors. And man, I'll tell you, some of these folks are downright creepy, especially for a movie as otherwise lighthearted as this. That's one of the things that, in my opinion, really makes this movie work, despite its many flaws; these characters are really interesting. Despite the movie being basically plotless, and much of the acting being of the competent-at-best variety, these characters are just plain fascinating, both in the ways they interact and their personalities.Of course, as the movie's IMDB rating and many of its comments there show, the public thinks much differently when it comes to Days of Darkness. So I can't just recommend it for everyone. But if you're a fan of silly zombie movies, this is an absolute must, and I think even the casual horror fan will get something out of it. Just don't go in expecting the next Return of the Living Dead and you should be fine. *** ",4,"Not bad for being ""that soap opera zombie movie""...",1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,3346,"['Days', 'Darkness', 'Jake', 'Kennedy', '2007', 'tagline', 'flick', '2', 'billion', 'zombies', '11', 'humans', 'Get', 'ready', 'rumble', 'should', 'probably', 'clue', 'fact', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'take', 'movie', 'seriously', 'lot', 'people', 'did', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'why', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'fact', 'movie', 'thanks', 'stars', 'Tom', 'Eplin', 'Sabrina', 'Gennarino', 'whom', 'have', 'appeared', 'soap', 'operas', 'recent', 'past', 'attracted', 'crowd', 'movie', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'used', 'horror', 'movies', 'certainly', 'not', 'low-budget', 'ones', 'made', 'people', 'enough', 'love', 'genre', 'movie', 'peppered', 'in-jokes', 'be', 'fair', 'are', 'movies', 'non-horror', 'crowd', 'successfully', 'okay', 'can', 'only', 'think', 'one', 'Final', 'Destination', 'really', 'flicks', 'are', 'made', 'horror', 'fans', 'horror', 'fans', 'realize', 'should', 'take', 'points', 'off', 'sort', 'thing', 'when', ""'m"", 'reviewing', 'movie', 'know', 'had', 'awful', 'lot', 'fun', 'movie', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'simply', 'take', 'what', 'slight', 'shallow', 'incredibly', 'fun', 'zombie', 'flick', 'really', 'really', 'warped', 'sense', 'humor', 'other', 'words', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'tailor-made', 'me.It', 'even', 'one', 'favorite', 'conceits', 'world', 'hell', 'protagonists', 'are', ""n't"", 'looking', 'Steve', 'TV', 'character', 'actor', 'Travis', 'Brorsen', 'Mimi', 'Roshelle', 'Pattison', 'forthcoming', 'highly-anticipated', 'Child', 'Reduction', 'Act', 'are', 'up', 'mountain', 'high', 'city', 'camping', 'fall', 'asleep', 'wake', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'pow', 'What', 'happened', 'night', 'opening', 'credits', 'lead', 'believe', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'weird', 'blue', 'meteor', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'Not', 'see', 'result', 'enough', 'result', 'everyone', 'world', 'well', 'nine', 'others', 'can', 'tell', 'tagline', 'become', 'living', 'dead', 'course', 'two', 'hook', 'up', 'other', 'nine', 'getting', 'saved', 'first', 'zombie', 'attack', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'archetypes', 'many', 'zombie', 'film', 'most', 'transparently', 'Romero', 'Day', 'Dead', 'militaristic', 'folks', 'who', 'want', 'blow', 'everything', 'up', 'curious', 'scientific', 'types', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'curl', 'up', 'little', 'ball', 'away', 'etc', 'good', 'zombie', 'movies', 'zombies', 'are', 'usually', 'backdrop', 'real', 'action', 'film', 'centers', 'interactions', 'survivors', 'man', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'folks', 'are', 'downright', 'creepy', 'especially', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'lighthearted', 'one', 'things', 'opinion', 'really', 'movie', 'work', 'many', 'flaws', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'interesting', 'movie', 'being', 'basically', 'plotless', 'much', 'acting', 'being', 'competent-at-best', 'variety', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'fascinating', 'ways', 'interact', 'personalities.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'IMDB', 'rating', 'many', 'comments', 'show', 'public', 'thinks', 'much', 'differently', 'when', 'Days', 'Darkness', 'So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'recommend', 'everyone', ""'re"", 'fan', 'silly', 'zombie', 'movies', 'absolute', 'must', 'think', 'even', 'casual', 'horror', 'fan', 'will', 'get', 'something', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'next', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', 'should', 'be', 'fine', '***']",Days Of Darkness

A fortunate few are hiding out at some sort of base, occasionally getting into heart-pounding squalls with the zombies.What makes this movie so interesting is how it's able to focus on the characters (some more likeable than others), and still have moments that will make you jump, shudder, etc.I noticed a solid Romero influence on this movie, which is equally as impressive as the emotional content and zombie terror.

1114174,A2W82ICVTTYAOY,B000XFVIOO,Zombob,"[1, 1]","Where's Donald Sutherland and Leonard Nimoy?1) ACTING: I felt that for a low / no budget indie, the acting wasn't really all that bad. A lot of times, the acting sets the tone for a movie, and if it's not all that good, that really puts the viewer in a mindset where he / she possible might not give the movie a chance. The actors here aren't going to be winning any Oscars anytime soon, but they were okay.2) PRODUCTION: First things first: I have to comment on the script. While watching this movie, I had this overwhelming sense of Deju Vu...similar scenes in different movies from the past kept running through my mind. Not that I was insulted by this, but I found it to be kind of distracting, as I kept wondering while viewing different scenes if I had seen it before. With the many plot devices that were in this movie, I don't really know if I can say that this is a ""ZOMBIE"" movie. It's more like an attack from outer space that also includes zombies. I really felt like I was watching yet ANOTHER unnecessary version of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Too much ""alien invaders,"" and not enough ""zombies.""Additionally, the characters were kind of stock. I know it is difficult to have characters we haven't seen before, but it seems like there is always a ""set"" group. I think that this made it difficult for any real character development. The filming was fine, the mood and the tone of the movie was okay, and there were no real lighting issues.The gore was good, but sadly, very minimal for a ""zombie"" movie. Now, I'm not asking for the gore /blood quantities of the Italian 1970's zombie flicks, but in a zombie movie, there should be a good amount of blood and gore.3) ZOMBIES: A mixture of shamblers and runners (for the minimal time they are on screen). The zombie make up is almost non-existent, as they seem to be just covered in blood. Not even the ""pale face, raccoon eyes"" make up is here.4) THE CAUSE: Alien Micro-organism infested comet from outer space.5) NUDITY: None.FINAL: While I don't hate this movie, I really can't praise it, either. I wanted a zombie movie and got a science fiction movie. If I wanted to see 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' again, I would've rented it. It wasn't a bad movie, I felt that it just wasn't a zombie movie. It was very reminiscent of Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead,' with all the human drama, but with a sci-fi twist. As a zombie movie, not real impressed. As a science fiction alien invasion from outer space movie, not all that bad. While I have my reservations regarding the director / writer, if he decides that his next movie will be a ZOMBIE movie, I'll be there.RATING: 2.5 out of 5",2,A review from Zombiefans!,1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,2656,"['Where', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', '1', 'ACTING', 'felt', 'low', '/', 'budget', 'indie', 'acting', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'bad', 'lot', 'times', 'acting', 'sets', 'tone', 'movie', 'not', 'good', 'really', 'viewer', 'mindset', 'where', 'possible', 'might', 'not', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'actors', 'here', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'winning', 'Oscars', 'anytime', 'soon', 'were', 'okay.2', 'PRODUCTION', 'First', 'things', 'first', 'have', 'comment', 'script', 'watching', 'movie', 'had', 'overwhelming', 'sense', 'Deju', 'Vu', 'similar', 'scenes', 'different', 'movies', 'past', 'kept', 'running', 'mind', 'Not', 'was', 'insulted', 'found', 'be', 'kind', 'distracting', 'kept', 'wondering', 'viewing', 'different', 'scenes', 'had', 'seen', 'many', 'plot', 'devices', 'were', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'can', 'say', 'ZOMBIE', 'movie', 'more', 'attack', 'outer', 'space', 'also', 'zombies', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'yet', 'ANOTHER', 'unnecessary', 'version', ""'Invasion"", 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'Too', 'much', 'alien', 'invaders', 'not', 'enough', 'zombies', 'Additionally', 'characters', 'were', 'kind', 'stock', 'know', 'difficult', 'have', 'characters', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'always', 'set', 'group', 'think', 'made', 'difficult', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'filming', 'was', 'fine', 'mood', 'tone', 'movie', 'was', 'okay', 'were', 'real', 'lighting', 'issues.The', 'gore', 'was', 'good', 'sadly', 'very', 'minimal', 'zombie', 'movie', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'asking', 'gore', '/blood', 'quantities', 'Italian', '1970', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'zombie', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'good', 'amount', 'blood', 'gore.3', 'ZOMBIES', 'mixture', 'shamblers', 'runners', 'minimal', 'time', 'are', 'screen', 'zombie', 'make', 'up', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'seem', 'be', 'just', 'covered', 'blood', 'Not', 'even', 'pale', 'face', 'raccoon', 'eyes', 'make', 'up', 'here.4', 'CAUSE', 'Alien', 'Micro-organism', 'infested', 'comet', 'outer', 'space.5', 'NUDITY', 'None.FINAL', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'movie', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'praise', 'either', 'wanted', 'zombie', 'movie', 'got', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'wanted', 'see', ""'Invasion"", 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'again', 'would', ""'ve"", 'rented', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'felt', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'zombie', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Romero', ""'Night"", 'Living', 'Dead', 'human', 'drama', 'sci-fi', 'twist', 'zombie', 'movie', 'not', 'real', 'impressed', 'science', 'fiction', 'alien', 'invasion', 'outer', 'space', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'have', 'reservations', 'regarding', 'director', '/', 'writer', 'next', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'ZOMBIE', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'there.RATING', '2.5', '5']",Days Of Darkness
