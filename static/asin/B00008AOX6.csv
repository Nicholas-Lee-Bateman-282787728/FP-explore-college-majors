These episodes are from Married...With Children's fourth season and I saw them both when they first aired. In ""Raingirl"",Kelly Bundy(Christina Applegate),takes a job on a TV news program as a ""weather bunny"". Her superiors realize how dyslexic Kelly is. Instead of saying ""storm"",she says ""strom"". Also she pronounces ""Chicago"" ""chick ago"". She was under contract for three years with an annual salary of $250,000 but her contract was revoked shortly after taking the job. Kelly's brother Bud(David Faustino) conducts a tour of the Bundy home(the tourists are Bud's high school buddies) and the buddies wave to Bud's and Kelly's mother Peggy(Katey Sagal) but not their father Al(Ed O'Neill). Kelly could have been making more money then Al as a shoe store manager. In ""Who'll Stop The Rain?"",Al goes to war against the Bundys' roof to plug up a hole and fix the television antenna atop it. Al,in his ""moron on the roof suit"",as Peggy calls it,falls off the Bundys roof,landing in the backyard. In another scene,Al and Peggy are in their bed and Al has a frying pan over his head to catch the dripping rainwater falling through the hole in the roof. After many pleas to call a profesional plumber,Al does no such thing. That's why he went up on the roof himself. This episode was also one of David Garrison's last. In this same episode,Garrison as former accountant Steve Rhoades,brings a gerbil from a pet store he now works at to the Bundy household. The female,poisonous creature attacked his wife Marcy(Amanda Bearse) after Steve placed her on Marcy's back. Steve told Marcy that the creature,that he thought was male and non-poisionous was just playing. Marcy ended up with a large lump on her back. After Garrison departed from the series in late 1989,it was written that Steve and Marcy got divorced and Steve became a forest ranger. But Marcy re-married a short time later. Long Branch,New Jersey-born Garrison returned to New York City to do a broadway show(he commuted from NYC to California to do MWC). He was later succeeded by Ted McGinley,late of Happy Days,who would play playboy Jefferson D'Arcy,who'd become Marcy's second husband and stick with her through the 1997 cancellation. The other episodes are awesome!

737844,A33UCQJ1QHU8B,B00008AOX6,Andy Radke,"[29, 32]","Despite the overwhelming public response to have this great season released in the form of complete season sets following the release of ""Married With Children: The Most Outrageous Episodes, Vol. 1"", it seems that our cries have fallen on deaf ears.  Columbia/Tri-Star has decided to go ahead with a 2nd compilation set containing ONLY 5 meazily episodes.  I love this show to death, but while lesser known sitcoms are getting the Royal treatment, the show that was innovative on so many levels recieves a paltry 5 episodes per disk.For those who are interested, the episodes contained on this disk are as follows:""A Man's Castle""""Raingirl""""Have You Driven A Ford Lately""""If Al Had A Hammer""""Who'll Stop The Rain?""This disk, same as the first, features a ""Salute To Sinatra"" as well as extra trailers.Why Columbia/Tri-Star would continue releasing this show in this calabre is beyond me.  It's a perennial classic which definitely deserves the full season treatment.  Geez, if ""Sports Night"", ""Felicity"" and ""Larry Sanders"" can be granted full season sets, then why on earth can't they do the same with this one.

There was a time when characters tied together, creating the most intelligent show on the air. Most of the episodes on this DVD are misguided tripe, the kind of episodes which eventually made me stop MWC long before it was taken off the air. And given all the reasons, I place the blame squarely on Fox, for ruining such a show.I agree that Steve's departure was a big loss, but I disagree that Jefferson ruined the show. Some of his early stuff, like ""You know in prison I could've had her silence for 3 cigarettes,"" is MWC-worthy hilarious. I don't think it was Jefferson who was responsible for the show's demise. One day (first episode of season 7) MWC just stopped being MWC. The rest was just a spinoff - and not in that funny Top of the Heap way.And here we are again, with a ""greatest hits"" set. You're wrong if you think being a die-hard MWC fan requires you to buy this DVD. These DVD's were made for the casual viewers, people who don't really understand the show, but like the occasional humor. These people would watch Dharma and Greg just as gladly.As a long-time MWC fan, I think Fox owes to the show's fans to produce decent sets. I'm glad people got together to give this DVD an average rating of 2.5 stars, because it doesn't deserve more than that. Release ""greatest hits"" collections when you're done putting out season sets. As for those who claim buying this DVD will help convince Fox to make season sets - don't pee on my shoe and tell me it's raining.",1,Please do not encourage fox in ripping people off,1046217600,"02 26, 2003",2003,1738,"['Bud', 'said', 'Am', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'emperor', 'not', 'wearing', 'underwear', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'idiotic', 'NOMAAM', 'skits', 'one-sided', 'propagandistic', 'humor', 'Married', 'Children', 'spinoff', 'featured', 'spinoff', 'being', 'seasons', '7', '12', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'characters', 'tied', 'together', 'creating', 'most', 'intelligent', 'show', 'air', 'Most', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'are', 'misguided', 'tripe', 'kind', 'episodes', 'eventually', 'made', 'stop', 'MWC', 'long', 'was', 'taken', 'off', 'air', 'given', 'reasons', 'place', 'blame', 'squarely', 'Fox', 'ruining', 'show.I', 'agree', 'Steve', 'departure', 'was', 'big', 'loss', 'disagree', 'Jefferson', 'ruined', 'show', 'early', 'stuff', 'know', 'prison', 'could', ""'ve"", 'had', 'silence', '3', 'cigarettes', 'MWC-worthy', 'hilarious', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'Jefferson', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'show', 'demise', 'One', 'day', 'first', 'episode', 'season', '7', 'MWC', 'just', 'stopped', 'being', 'MWC', 'rest', 'was', 'just', 'spinoff', 'not', 'funny', 'Top', 'Heap', 'way.And', 'here', 'are', 'again', 'greatest', 'hits', 'set', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'think', 'being', 'die-hard', 'MWC', 'fan', 'buy', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'were', 'made', 'casual', 'viewers', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'understand', 'show', 'occasional', 'humor', 'people', 'would', 'watch', 'Dharma', 'Greg', 'just', 'gladly.As', 'long-time', 'MWC', 'fan', 'think', 'Fox', 'show', 'fans', 'produce', 'decent', 'sets', ""'m"", 'glad', 'people', 'got', 'together', 'give', 'DVD', 'average', 'rating', '2.5', 'stars', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'more', 'Release', 'greatest', 'hits', 'collections', 'when', ""'re"", 'done', 'putting', 'out', 'season', 'sets', 'who', 'claim', 'buying', 'DVD', 'will', 'help', 'convince', 'Fox', 'make', 'season', 'sets', 'do', ""n't"", 'pee', 'shoe', 'tell', 'raining']","Married with Children, Vol. 2 - The Most Outrageous Episodes"
