242671,A1DQ3KRA6AD4KI,6301008804,erica2,"[1, 4]","My son and I watched about 20 minutes of this. I had to turn it off because it seemed to be giving the message that life is all about obtaining money and power i.e. fame and fortune. All these pathetic characters are trying to win a talent show and lift themselves up out of mediocrity and they fix on Clifford to help him do it because he's such an oddity in the larger world. The emphasis that life is all about winning big and then having it made for life (free dog food for the rest of Clifford's life) seemed to be reinforcing one of the sickest myths of U.S. culture, that becoming a star is where it's at. If that's what you believe life is all about and you want to teach that to your kids, this might be the movie for you, although, based on the reviews, other people had problems with it for other reasons. Anyway, I couldn't in good conscience let my son continue to watch it. Maybe in the end they had a turn around and it didn't actually promote the warped values it seemed to at the beginning but the way the plot seemed to be moving made me turn it off. My son didn't much mind and quickly returned to his beloved Thomas.",1,had to turn it off,1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,1136,"['son', 'watched', '20', 'minutes', 'had', 'turn', 'off', 'seemed', 'be', 'giving', 'message', 'life', 'obtaining', 'money', 'power', 'i.e', 'fame', 'fortune', 'pathetic', 'characters', 'are', 'trying', 'win', 'talent', 'show', 'lift', 'mediocrity', 'fix', 'Clifford', 'help', 'do', 'such', 'oddity', 'larger', 'world', 'emphasis', 'life', 'winning', 'big', 'then', 'having', 'made', 'life', 'free', 'dog', 'food', 'rest', 'Clifford', 'life', 'seemed', 'be', 'reinforcing', 'one', 'sickest', 'myths', 'U.S.', 'culture', 'becoming', 'star', 'where', 'what', 'believe', 'life', 'want', 'teach', 'kids', 'might', 'be', 'movie', 'based', 'reviews', 'other', 'people', 'had', 'problems', 'other', 'reasons', 'Anyway', 'could', ""n't"", 'good', 'conscience', 'let', 'son', 'continue', 'watch', 'Maybe', 'end', 'had', 'turn', 'around', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'promote', 'warped', 'values', 'seemed', 'beginning', 'way', 'plot', 'seemed', 'be', 'moving', 'made', 'turn', 'off', 'son', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'mind', 'quickly', 'returned', 'beloved', 'Thomas']",N/A

With very little conflict, the film struggles to keep pace over its (extremely short) running time. The educational factor of the show (""Read Books Kids!"") is completely missing and the few jokes that appeared were pretty predictable. This may entertain an undeserning three-year-old but not mine and there is absolutely nothing there for adults. With the advent of the likes of Toy Story, I thought that this kind of bland rubbish had ceased to be made.The plot has potential but the bland script and even blander characters scupper any chances of interest. The voice cast are generally poor (the show's cast seem to have been replaced and John Goodman is wasted) and the only character who shows any potential at all - a ferret - is an obvious rip-off of The Lion King's Timon.  The animation is, if anything, of a lower standard than the show in places and the general feel is ""why on earth has this been given a cinema release?"" Many of these flaws may be diminished on TV but with high quality Direct to Retail animations coming out of Warners (Scooby-Doo especially), how did this stand out as being better?The word is BLAND.",1,Clifford's Really Bland Movie,1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,1554,"['took', 'three-year-old', 'see', 'cinema', 'would', 'like', 'make', 'two', 'points', 'trip', 'reflect', 'quality', 'film.1', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'people', 'entire', 'auditorium2', 'fell', 'asleep', 'half', 'way', 'filmHe', 'TV', 'show', 'often', 'sit', 'watch', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'show', 'edge.The', 'lack', 'edge', 'however', 'one', 'major', 'downfalls', 'movie', 'very', 'little', 'conflict', 'film', 'keep', 'pace', 'extremely', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'educational', 'factor', 'show', 'Read', 'Books', 'Kids', 'completely', 'missing', 'few', 'jokes', 'appeared', 'were', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'may', 'entertain', 'undeserning', 'three-year-old', 'not', 'mine', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'there', 'adults', 'advent', 'likes', 'Toy', 'Story', 'thought', 'kind', 'bland', 'rubbish', 'had', 'ceased', 'be', 'made.The', 'plot', 'potential', 'bland', 'script', 'even', 'blander', 'characters', 'scupper', 'chances', 'interest', 'voice', 'cast', 'are', 'generally', 'poor', 'show', 'cast', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'John', 'Goodman', 'wasted', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'potential', 'ferret', 'obvious', 'rip-off', 'Lion', 'King', 'Timon', 'animation', 'anything', 'lower', 'standard', 'show', 'places', 'general', 'feel', 'why', 'earth', 'been', 'given', 'cinema', 'release', 'Many', 'flaws', 'may', 'be', 'diminished', 'TV', 'high', 'quality', 'Direct', 'Retail', 'animations', 'coming', 'Warners', 'Scooby-Doo', 'especially', 'how', 'did', 'stand', 'out', 'being', 'better', 'word', 'BLAND']",N/A
