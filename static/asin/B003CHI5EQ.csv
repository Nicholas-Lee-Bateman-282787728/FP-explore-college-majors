I ordered this 2 months ago, and I was too P'ed off to even come here and complain...I guess finally I can forget about this GROSS MISTAKE on my part for buying, opening and watching this DVD.I already have all this stuff on tape from my own recordings and to think that I paid $13.49 for something I already have and something that was originally free in the first place...really SUCKS.It can't be sent back now because it's opened and I wouldn't think of selling it to anyone, BUT because it's MICHAEL, I will put it with all the other items that I have to remember him by and live this stupid mistake down.Making and Selling this DVD was literally a CRIME...honestly!",1,Unless you don't own a TV...,1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,1373,"['have', 'been', 'living', 'rock', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'interviews', 'would', 'be', 'NEWS', 'BUT', 'not', 'who', 'followed', 'Michael', 'move', 'TOTAL', 'RIP', 'OFF', 'person', 'who', 'put', 'DVD', 'here', 'sale', 'knew', 'one', 'would', 'buy', 'gave', 'CONTENTS', 'KNOW', 'WHY', 'interviews', 'were', 'FREE', 'Television', 'Oprah', 'CRAPPY', 'tribute', 'interview', 'mean', 'what', 'WRONG', 'whoever', 'are', 'MAKING', 'A', 'DVD', 'sale', 'NONSENSE', 'when', 'was', 'regular', 'TV', 'completely', 'undermined', 'MICHAEL', 'TRIBUTE.I', 'made', 'MISTAKE', 'HOPING', 'interviews', 'DVD', 'were', 'ones', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'stupid', 'slap', 'face', 'ordered', '2', 'months', 'ago', 'was', 'too', ""P'ed"", 'even', 'come', 'here', 'complain', 'guess', 'finally', 'can', 'forget', 'GROSS', 'MISTAKE', 'part', 'buying', 'opening', 'watching', 'DVD.I', 'already', 'have', 'stuff', 'tape', 'own', 'recordings', 'think', 'paid', '13.49', 'something', 'already', 'have', 'something', 'was', 'originally', 'free', 'first', 'place', 'really', 'SUCKS.It', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'sent', 'back', 'now', 'opened', 'would', ""n't"", 'think', 'selling', 'anyone', 'BUT', 'MICHAEL', 'will', 'put', 'other', 'items', 'have', 'remember', 'live', 'stupid', 'mistake', 'down.Making', 'Selling', 'DVD', 'was', 'literally', 'CRIME', 'honestly']",N/A

What I found is for two hours you get three interviews1. MJ's interview with at large with Geraldo-Mind you this is during the 2005 trial. Great reference to have, besides Geraldo is one of my favorite interviewers.2. Brad Wallace of 60 minutes interview with MJ- one word ""distastful"" out of all the interviews to be had they pull this one out of the hat. Pathetic, or desperate I am not sure, maybe both because the last interview will leave a bad taste in your mouth.3.. This is with one of my least favorite people as well as a interviewer-It is Oprahs ""remembering Michael"" so called tribute. When she throw stones at MJ's 1993 interview picking him apart. Showing how bias she truly is when speaking about MJ. I am not her fan, so to those who have a distaste for someone picking apart the ""king of pop"" this dvd isn't for you.I am going to see if I can take it back and get a refund.. I am Truly disappointed in their choices of interviews, you would think they could of picked ones that flattered MJ, not rake him over, besides he is not here to defend himself.This appalls me.. So my advice to you is don't buy this garbage..",1,"""Disappointed""",1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,1252,"['When', 'received', 'dvd', 'today', 'was', 'skeptical', 'yet', 'excited', 'hoping', 'were', 'Jet', 'interviews', 'other', 'What', 'found', 'two', 'hours', 'get', 'three', 'interviews1', 'MJ', 'interview', 'large', 'Geraldo-Mind', '2005', 'trial', 'Great', 'reference', 'have', 'Geraldo', 'one', 'favorite', 'interviewers.2', 'Brad', 'Wallace', '60', 'minutes', 'interview', 'MJ-', 'one', 'word', 'distastful', 'interviews', 'be', 'had', 'pull', 'one', 'out', 'hat', 'Pathetic', 'desperate', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'maybe', 'last', 'interview', 'will', 'leave', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth.3..', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'people', 'as', 'well', 'interviewer-It', 'Oprahs', 'remembering', 'Michael', 'so', 'called', 'tribute', 'When', 'throw', 'stones', 'MJ', '1993', 'interview', 'picking', 'apart', 'Showing', 'how', 'bias', 'truly', 'when', 'speaking', 'MJ', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'so', 'who', 'have', 'distaste', 'someone', 'picking', 'apart', 'king', 'pop', 'dvd', ""n't"", 'you.I', 'am', 'going', 'see', 'can', 'take', 'back', 'get', 'refund..', 'am', 'Truly', 'disappointed', 'choices', 'interviews', 'would', 'think', 'could', 'picked', 'ones', 'flattered', 'MJ', 'not', 'rake', 'over', 'not', 'here', 'defend', 'himself.This', 'appalls', 'me..', 'So', 'advice', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'garbage..']",N/A
