Even after it went off the air I watch it faithfully in syndication on the family channel.  My three year old daughter is also now a fan.  It is great to have these on DVD.  The freedom to watch them when I want just makes it more enjoyable.  Having a rough day?  Throw on Whose Line.  Having friends over and not sure what to do?  Throw on Whose Line.  Whose Line may just be the answer to many tough questions in life.  Great comedy from some of the most talented Improvers of the day.
