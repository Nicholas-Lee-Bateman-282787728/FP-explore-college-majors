Since the mains caracter are looking to find the lost memory fragment of Sakura, sometime they may arrive in some places were they will not succed. You really still feel that the story is alway there in each episode. There are some problems with this anime : 1) no real end, it would need another season at least. 2) We dont know how many fragment there is so the anime could continue for years like a soap opera.Still, I was highly entertain by that anime, each world visited was fun to discover.

I wish that anime fans would do their job, so the rest of us can know what we are buying.Everything here is encoded at 1080p/24 but the source quality varies.Season One is your typical standard definition upscale but Season Two is native 720p HD (upscaled to 1080p/24 for Blu-Ray release, which in my opinion companies should not do, but the Japanese are the ones doing this on everything so it is their fault, not Funimation's). The ""Next Episode"" and Episode Title still slides on Season One are also in HD (which doesn't mean much, just pointing it out).The opening/ending credits on Season One are upscaled SD, and so is the overlayed credit text. The animation is also messed up in a really weird way. This happens regularly on encoded anime (it shouldn't though, there's no excuse) but it is not the common 24 fps --> 30 fps stutter that is caused by an improper 30p encode of a 24p source. I think the opening/ending is double-stuttering, that is to say the source went from 24p to 30p (when Funimation put their overlayed credits) and back to 24p for encoding. The textless opening/ending credits, which are thankfully included, animate perfectly and are encoded at 24p.No problems with Season Two, other than my wish to see native 720p anime encoded at 720p.Haven't watched the Princess of Birdcage Kingdom movie yet.I won't give a detailed review of the show itself because I hated this series. :) Good thing I only paid $30 for it. I'm generally not a fan of Clamp works and have never read the manga, and would never want to. I usually like Bee Train anime though: this is the first one that I have not liked. Their slow directing style either does not work with Clamp's story, or they just did a lazy job and made poor decisions for this series. It seems as though Tsubasa Chronicle neither satisfied Clamp fans nor Bee Train fans, so I'm surprised that there are still as many people that like this show as there are (there are also many people who hate this show, mostly Clamp fans).",3,"A review of the Blu-Ray video quality, because no one else did it right...",1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,2130,"['product', 'been', 'out', 'while', 'now', 'am', 'sad', 'be', 'who', 'finally', 'proper', 'review', 'video', 'quality', 'wish', 'anime', 'fans', 'would', 'do', 'job', 'rest', 'can', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'buying.Everything', 'here', 'encoded', '1080p/24', 'source', 'quality', 'varies.Season', 'One', 'typical', 'standard', 'definition', 'upscale', 'Season', 'Two', 'native', '720p', 'HD', 'upscaled', '1080p/24', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'opinion', 'companies', 'should', 'not', 'do', 'Japanese', 'are', 'ones', 'doing', 'everything', 'fault', 'not', 'Funimation', 'Next', 'Episode', 'Episode', 'Title', 'still', 'Season', 'One', 'are', 'also', 'HD', ""n't"", 'mean', 'much', 'just', 'pointing', 'out', '.The', 'opening/ending', 'credits', 'Season', 'One', 'are', 'upscaled', 'SD', 'so', 'overlayed', 'credit', 'text', 'animation', 'also', 'messed', 'up', 'really', 'weird', 'way', 'regularly', 'encoded', 'anime', 'should', ""n't"", 'though', 'excuse', 'not', 'common', '24', 'fps', '30', 'fps', 'stutter', 'caused', 'improper', '30p', 'encode', '24p', 'source', 'think', 'opening/ending', 'double-stuttering', 'say', 'source', 'went', '24p', '30p', 'when', 'Funimation', 'put', 'overlayed', 'credits', 'back', '24p', 'encoding', 'textless', 'opening/ending', 'credits', 'are', 'thankfully', 'included', 'animate', 'perfectly', 'are', 'encoded', '24p.No', 'problems', 'Season', 'Two', 'other', 'wish', 'see', 'native', '720p', 'anime', 'encoded', '720p.Have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Princess', 'Birdcage', 'Kingdom', 'movie', 'yet.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'detailed', 'review', 'show', 'hated', 'series', 'Good', 'thing', 'only', 'paid', '30', ""'m"", 'generally', 'not', 'fan', 'Clamp', 'works', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'manga', 'would', 'never', 'want', 'usually', 'Bee', 'Train', 'anime', 'first', 'one', 'have', 'not', 'liked', 'slow', 'directing', 'style', 'either', 'not', 'work', 'Clamp', 'story', 'just', 'did', 'lazy', 'job', 'made', 'poor', 'decisions', 'series', 'Tsubasa', 'Chronicle', 'satisfied', 'Clamp', 'fans', 'Bee', 'Train', 'fans', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'are', 'still', 'many', 'people', 'show', 'are', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'hate', 'show', 'mostly', 'Clamp', 'fans']",Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle: Collected Memories

The images are blurry, the lines are fuzzy, colors washed out, everything as a glow around it, there is noticeable gradient banding, and artifacting during many scenes. If you own the DVDs, stick with them as they are the best quality available.If you want a HD version of this anime wait for the official release from the studio, not some cheap Funimation weekend project. I ended up returning the two part sets, because I am not going to pay for this horrible mess of a release.I added a few screenshots to the images section to show how bad this release is.
