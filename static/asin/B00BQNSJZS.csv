1637610,A3CW0ZLUO5X2B1,B00BQNSJZS,"35-year Technology Consumer ""8-tracks to 802.11""","[0, 0]","To quickly categorize ""Arcadia"" as a either a ""road movie"" or a coming of age story means falling short of the richly textured examination it offers of a family in crisis.The movie opens with father Tom loading his three kids (9-year old son Nat and two older sisters: 12-year old Greta and late teen Caroline) for a trip in an aging station wagon from the east coast to Arcadia, California. Left behind is their dog and the family's mom. Mom is promised to join them later. The absence of mom becomes a major piece of tension in the movie, and other dogs will appear along the way as reminders of what they have left behind.Tom is variously philosophical, angry and irrational as he deals with a vague job offer, and intermittently lashes out at his kids, telephone callers, a waitress, en route family friends and a park ranger on their way west. While the children's portion of this story is centered on middle child Greta, each of the three kids face unhappy, revealing and necessary truths about themselves, their parents and their lives during this trip.""Arcadia"" offers plenty of ambiguity about the state of Tom's professional and marital, and parental competence as he moves his kids west on the cheap.Any further discussion of plot details could jeopardize enjoyment of this bittersweet story. As with the best books and movies, things and people aren't often what they seem, and sometimes the way they change can surprise us.This movie is subtle and understated. The road memes are awesomely portrayed, the characters are rich and believable.

As is almost always the case, John Hawkes' acting is persuasive and amazing.  He always becomes the character he plays and this one is  conflicted but resolute in his belief that he is doing the right thing and that nothing else matters.  The young actress playing Greta is also wonderfully heartbreaking in this role.

He takes his children from their beds in the middle of the night and leaves with them on a road trip cross-country to their new destination. He tells them that their mother will be meeting them in California. However, as the road trip progresses, things are not quite as they seem. Tom has an anger problem and is not very straight shooting with his three children. Greta, the twelve year old, is the person with whom we identify most. In a sense, it is through her eyes that we see this movie unfold. She is on the cusp of adolescence and is leaving her childhood behind with every mile that they travel. She counters her dad's comments and it is with her that he gets most angry.The movie is a steady progress of the life of this family as they move together and apart and then together again. Truth becomes unmasked and forgiveness becomes a viable way to negotiate changes. The movie moves slowly but steadily to fruition in both a melodic and dystonic manner.

1637613,AUX7KVELDYZZ6,B00BQNSJZS,"Brett H ""pentangle""","[1, 2]","When Tom (John Hawkes) bundles his three children, Caroline (Kendall Toole), Greta (Ryan Elise Simpkins) and Nat (Ty Simpkins) into his car at the break of day, for a three thousand mile road journey to Arcadia, Los Angeles, California, he is promising them a new life and a bright tomorrow.  After being unemployed he has finally managed to find a job in Arcadia and needs the family to relocate.  Mum is noticeable by her absence, but Tom tells the children she will be following later.There are tensions on the journey and Tom is clearly on edge, as he fights with another motorist and shows other signs of being under pressure, including, at one stage, leaving Greta on a deserted road in the middle of nowhere.  Meanwhile doubts begin to creep in as to what has happened to Mother since she appears to be uncontactable by phone, and Tom's explanations seem increasingly doubtful to the children.John Hawkes and Ryan Simpkins put in masterful performances and in truth the main action is in the relationship between these two.  As far as Greta is concerned this is a coming of age movie, exemplified symbolically in Walnut Canyon, as her stuff toy is discarded.  The other two main characters are really in supporting roles, but both also deliver very adequate performances.This is not a fast moving film, but it is very well filmed and the pace is very measured.

1637614,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B00BQNSJZS,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Arcadia is a long slow moving film about a father that decides to move his three children from the east coast to California. This is a depressing film that sadly has few bright moments.The film opens with the father waking his three children up and telling them it is time to get in the car, they are leaving for California. There was, what I thought would be a critical detail during the opening montage of the father tossing a ball to his daughter Greta (she had many names in the film, almost too many to count). The girl turns as her father says, catch. She catches the ball in another sequence and the ball is black, almost burned on two sides. The construct of the ball catching was repeated a few times in the film, but was never repeated as the bookend to the film. There was never resolution of why that ball was black. Although this may sound a bit odd, I felt cheated with the director not completing that thread.This is an incredibly rare moment for me. I have watched around 40 Film Movement films, there are possibly two that I didn't care for. All the others were masterpieces, films I loved watching and couldn't get enough of. Tonight, I watched a film that I didn't like. From a pure story line perspective, within minutes it was clear the father was running from something. About midway through the film it became clear what was happening and there were two possible endings, the father was lying or the father was telling the truth. To me a film that leaves only two possible endings at the middle point has taken all the interest out of the film.From a character standpoint, the father was a jerk and incredibly unlikeable. He had the personality of an alcoholic that one moment would be sweet and wonderful and another nasty petty person. The children were victims and it was difficult to have a lot of compassion for them. Greta stared off in the distance a lot, and was in deep thought. At one point her sister teases her for loving Emo music. Sometimes I felt sorry for Greta, which is not a good feeling to get from a character.From a film standpoint, there were just way too many shots of moving countryside from the car window. There was a lot of shaky handheld camera work. The audio was not clear most of the time. Oddly, I thought at first the hour and a half film was about 20 minutes too long. But after seeing the short included on the DVD, it is clear the film is an hour and 10 minutes too long (more on the short at the bottom of this review).The acting was reasonably good. Greta and her young brother are excellent actors. John Hawkes played the father, and given his long filmography, it was expected that he would do an excellent job. I was disappointed with the older daughter played by Kendall Toole. Compared to the other actors, she was stiff and was the least believable.There was a strange inappropriate homage to The Brown Bunny. A stuffed rabbit is central to both films. And there is a horrifically long car ride where not much happens in both films. There were even some stylistic film elements that were similar. Both are a form of coming of age films. And they both have a 1970 / 80's feel to them. Of course there is no graphic climatic scene in Arcadia.The film is unrated. It would have an R rating for the strong language. A mature younger viewer that understands emotional distress would probably be fine watching the film. On the other hand, violence and some of the other things that make a film R rated are easy for younger viewers to deal with. There is a strong psychological message in this film that sensitive younger viewers would probably have difficulty with.Sadly, I just didn't care for this film. I kept thinking I was going to cry, but yet I didn't. Looking back, it didn't happen because I didn't feel a connection with Greta. Not because what was happening to her was bad, but because it just took so darn long to get to that point. I felt like I just took a many day trip across the country in a nasty old station wagon with no air conditioning.The DVD includes the classic Film Movements Short. Normally this is a 20 minute film that is either one of the worst films ever made, extends the theme of the main film, or is a masterpiece (these shorts are all over the map). Tonight the short is....wait for it... the 20 minute version of this film, Little Canyon. Honestly, this film works. It is exactly the right length; it covers the exact same territory with more feeling. The ending is different; sadly it goes the opposite direction, a bad thing. If I had known the short was the same film, I could have saved an hour and ten minutes.In a way the short is an interesting study. If I loved Arcadia, the source material for the longer film would have been magnificent. Instead, there was no way I was going to watch another version of the same film for another twenty minutes. I used fast forward to see that these were the same film.I feel bad about this film. I love the Film Movement series. It is one of the most incredible uses of film today. They rank right up there with the Criterion Collection in finding meaningful incredible films and then presenting them to a larger audience. I am confident that this is one anomaly in a long history of greatness. There were previews of two films that look incredibly good.I was provided a sample for review.",3,Didn't Care For The Film,1373673600,"07 13, 2013",2013,5332,"['Arcadia', 'long', 'slow', 'moving',

1637615,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00BQNSJZS,Grady Harp,"[4, 4]","Olivia Silver cautiously expanded her prize winning short film `Little Canyon' into a meticulously crafted full length film, changed the name to ARCADIA , and found a fine cast to direct for this ensemble work. It is sensitively written, directed and acted and should become a cult film for those who love quiet meaningful dramas.In a New England town Tom (John Hawkes, so brilliant as the quadriplegic virgin in `The Sessions') is gathering his three young children - Caroline (Kendall Toole) Greta (Ryan Simpkins0 and Nat (Ty Simpkins) - into his station wagon to move to California: he has been out of work for six months and landed a job in Arcadia, California. His wife is not joining them on the trip but Tom assures the children she will join them in California. Each of the three children must leave behind something important to them and each takes with them the hope that things will be better in California. Tom does not tell them truthfully why their mother is not with them on the trip - that truth comes out at the end of the film. Caroline handles the concept of the move best, though she leaves behind her boyfriend. Greta is the one who is in that zone of changing from girl to woman: she still carries her toy bunny and her box of photos with her, and on the trip she enters the terrors of puberal changes. Nat is encased in the innocence of childhood and that state is threatened at several points during the trip. The interaction of this four-member family is tense but there is an underlying love that shines through, even though Tom's manner of being both father and mother is not without flaws. ARCADIA is a true coming of age story for all four characters and the sensitivity each of these fine actors brings to the story is magical.In a time when movies are so concentrated on potty mouth guy films and gal films or shoveling expensive special effects mega pictures to predict the end of mankind, ARCADIA glows with intelligence and finesse. It is quietly one of the finest films of the year.

We get so used to the fast paced, punch-line filled movies from the big studios that it is such a pleasure to watch a movie that just 'is'.Arcadia is a soft spoken movie about a family (minus mom) driving over 3,000 miles in a beat up and over packed station wagon (with the crock pot precariously balanced between the two kids in the back seat) to their new home and life in Arcadia, California. They leave a bunch of belongings behind with the premise that mom will be joining them soon. We never see mom and she never answers the phone. About halfway through I started to realize that something was not right with dad's story.Tom (dad) is doing his best, and often failing, at keeping his three kids happy and excited about their new adventures. He is often behind the scenes arguing and the true picture of their family's troubles slowly comes out.Twelve-year-old Greta is charming, beautiful and commands the screen. Her older sister and younger brother are the perfect compliment to the family dynamic.

1637618,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BQNSJZS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Through the years, we've seen John Hawkes transform from one of our most reliable character actors into a bona fide leading man. Whether scary (Winter's Bone) or sympathetic (The Sessions), he is just so natural in front of the camera. There is no artifice, no grandstanding, he simply embodies each new character in a very organic way. His presence in Olivia Silver's tiny slice-of-life saga ""Arcadia"" was its primary selling point in my estimation. How ""The Sessions"" did not net him a Best Actor nod at the Oscars (he was amply rewarded elsewhere) is still one of last year's most perplexing oversights. ""Arcadia"" is simultaneously a coming-of-age tale, a familiar story of family dysfunction, and a road trip narrative. Hawkes and his two children are making a cross country journey to a land of new hopes and promises. Arcadia, California is painted as an idyllic destination that will bring prosperity and happiness to the clan. Although Hawkes is the headliner, it is through the eyes of twelve year old Greta (an effective Ryan Simpkins) that most of the action unfolds. On this journey, she will begin to come to grips with the truths inherent in her family.""Arcadia"" begins on a very upbeat note. As the trio of lead characters embark on their trip, they are filled with a true sense of adventure. The mother, however, is notably absent but is said to be joining them at a later date. Silver's screenplay clues the viewer fairly early that all is not roses and sunshine in this situation. As the film progresses, tensions escalate as relations between Hawkes and Simpkins start to break down. Simpkins resents being kept in the dark, and Hawkes is struggling to maintain an illusion. An ill-fated trip to the Grand Canyon causes a final melt down. And before the family reaches Arcadia, they will have to deal with some unpleasantness, some truth, and start to communicate in a more effective way. ""Arcadia"" is not a big plot driven movie, it is more about how characters evolve in difficult periods. Even if we love and want to protect those in our immediate family, it is not always within our power to prevent the hurt.As I mentioned, part of what makes ""Arcadia"" so effective is its realness. You feel as if you are trapped in this deteriorating road trip as one its participants. Hawkes is good at both the manic moments and the angriest outbursts, and Simpkins is always believable as a girl who starts to question what is before her. Their exchanges are the movie's strongest and most memorable moments. The DVD release also includes the 20 minute short film ""Little Canyon"" as its Bonus feature. This is Silver's original idea that was expanded into feature film length. I'd recommend watching ""Arcadia"" first, however, so as not to spoil one of the movie's highlights with the short version. It starts out at a very critical juncture in the full length story. Overall, ""Arcadia"" is a small film with modest ambitions. By keeping things scaled down, it works very well. It may not be for everyone due to its methodical pacing and lack of significant plotting. But for those that enjoy the spirit of indie films, this character study has a nice pay off.

1637619,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00BQNSJZS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 2]","I was immediately worried about Harrison, the stuffed rabbit that 12-year-old Greta (Ryan Simpkins) constantly carries around when we meet her at the start of writer-director Olivia Silver's ""Arcadia.""  In the opening minute of this 2013 film it becomes clear that Greta is the focal character, that her stuffed animal is a symbol of her youthful innocence, and that whatever is about to happen, it is not going to be good.  Early one morning her father loads Greta, her older sister and young brother, plus all their wordly possessions, into a dented blue station wagon to drive across the country to California, a new job, and a new life, one in which he promises their absent mother will be joining them.  This sounds like a good thing, but the father's words ring hollow, because Silver is providing subtle clues that create a sense of unease.  Plus, the whole idea of a family driving to the promised land in California reminds me of the Joads in ""The Grapes of Wrath,"" and we all remember how well that worked out.As Tom, the father, John Hawkes is able to make the mercurical changes from being charming to being on the verge of exploding, similar to what he did in ""Martha Marcy May Marlene.""  Such characters are well established creatures, but Hawkes is able to pull off both parts of the equation well enough, especially the charming part, that for once I am willing to indulge in the possibility that there might actually be some good in him.  But his constant explosions over everything from the amount of wine in his glass to the cost for visiting the Grand Canyon make both us and Greta wary.There is sort of Goldilocks and the Three Bears subtext to the interaction between Tom and his kids as he tries to weave his magic.  For Caroline (Kendall Toole) his constant stories and perpetual promises are too little and for Greta they becoming too much and more so by the minute and the mile, while for Nat (Ty Simpkins, Ryan's brother), the youngest and who eats up each and every syllable Dad utters, they are just right.  Greta is the middle child, not just in terms of age, but in terms of making the transition from the innocence of youth represented by Nat to the already world weary Caroiline.Ryan Simpkins has over a dozen film credits on her resume already (""Gardens of the Night,"" ""Sherry Baby,""Revolutionary Road),"" which matters because this movie hinges on her performance as Greta.  I would not be surprised if she has the least amount of dialogue of any of the four family members in that station wagon, because Silver's approach in this film is to show rather than tell, which requires Simpkins to say little but observe much.  We, as the audience, invest her silent looks with significance, but both the character and her creator are loath to provide too many details as to what she is actually thinking, although her absent mother is a major part of the equation, especially as every mile driven seems to be lengthening rather than shortening the distance between them.  Simpkins' performance is on a par with those in her age group that have been nominated for Oscars, such as ""Whale Rider"" and ""Beasts Of The Southern Wild,"" where the ability to deliver a line takes a secondary importance to being able to evoke authentic feelings in the audience.What is clear, is that Greta is growing up and that when she gets out of that station wagon in California she will not be the same girl who began that trip.  As you might suspect, her personal Rubicon comes in the latter part of the journey, and involves Harrison.  Silver is able to do much more with the symbolism of that rabbit with that one moment, with which she is able to offer up the sort of lyrical grace note you want to have in a story where you have such great sympathy for a young girl growing up faster than she should have to.The DVD includes ""Little Canyon,"" the 20 minute short by Silver that was her thesis film and the basis for ""Arcadia.""  My recommendation is to watch this after you see the movie because I think it is more interesting to go back and see the basis for the movie and to consider in retrospect the way Silver fleshed out the narrative and went beyond the original ending, rather than constantly being aware of all that has been added.  Either way, what you will find is that Silver preserves the lyrical essence of the original.The genesis of these films was an assignment Silver's first year of graduate film school at UCLA where she was asked to sit down and write the first dream or memory that came to mind, and she wrote down a memory of arriving in California after a five day cross-country trip in the family's run-down station wagon.  The importance of memory is established at the start of ""Arcadia,"" and our sympathy for Greta is such that we hope by the time we get to the final credits that she will have some good memories of her family or the trip or just something in her life.This is an engaging first film, a rough little gem with some nicely polished moments.  This speaks well for Silver's future as a filmmaker, because the history of Hollywood seems to clearly indicate that it is better to establish a foundation upon which to build rather to go super nova with your first effort and have a slim chance of going in any other direction than down.",4,A lyrical film about a young girl on a cross-country trip,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,5284,"['was',

1637620,A2EMIIHBL60K7L,B00BQNSJZS,Luanne Ollivier,"[0, 1]","This is director Olivia Silver's debut feature film. Silver produced a short film for her thesis based on a memory from her own childhood - pulling into her family driveway after a cross country road trip.In Arcadia, Tom wakes his three children very early and piles them into the family station wagon, to start their journey from New England to California. Tom has accepted a new job after being jobless for over six months. They seem ill prepared as they head out, with packing still being thrown together in the last few minutes. Twelve year old Greta grabs her stuffed bunny Harrison and her memory box. Nine year old Nat is doted upon and very attached to Greta. Caroline is older and sits up front with Dad, navigating and talking on the phone. What's missing? Mom. But, Tom promises, Mom will be joining them soon.Right from the beginning, we get a sense that something is 'off'. As the journey progresses, Greta continues to question where their mother is and why they can't reach her. Tom keeps deflecting the questions and tries to jolly the kids along, telling stories, making promises and talking about their new house. But the more he tries to pretend nothing is wrong, the worse things get.Academy Award nominee John Hawkes's portrayal of  Tom was excellent. Despite his upbeat mood, there is an underlying sense of danger and the feeling that Tom is only barely holding things together. There are several disturbing scenes where he 'loses' it. What is lost is innocence - that of Greta. This trip is a coming of age for her as childhood is left behind and she is forced to confront many truths about her family. Ryan Simpkins was phenomenal and stole the show for me. Nat was played by her brother Ty Simpkins, making the ties between them even more believable.I'm sure if I looked closely at the cars, I could put a year on the movie. But I didn't - and I couldn't. The station wagon brought back my own memories of family road trips. Scenes shot from inside the car looking out at the scenery captured the 'real' feeling of the film. Sepia tones, washed out landscapes and tired buildings all echoed the run down, worn out sense that surrounds Tom.Silver cleverly manipulates our emotions and then surprised me at the end with a turn I didn't see coming.

Filled with amazing actors and a subtly moving plot, 'Arcadia' is one step ahead of most independent films.Tom (Academy Award nominated actor John Hawkes; &#34;The Sessions&#34;, &#34;Winter's Bone&#34;) plays the father who abruptly gathers his three children into an old station wagon to travel from New England to Arcadia, California.Tom has a new job and Mom won't be joining them until later, adding to the mystery. Eldest sister, Caroline (Kendall Toole in a breakout performance) is joined by moody, middle daughter Greta (played with explosive calmness by Ryan Simpkins - (&#34;Revolutionary Road&#34; and &#34;Surveillance&#34;, which gave her a Best Actress award at the NYC Film Festival - the first child to ever win). The youngest member of the family is Ty Simpkins (&#34;Iron Man 3&#34; and Ryan's real little brother).The journey is full of Tom filling the time exalting an assortment of wild stories, assurances and a great new life. Caroline is slightly removed, having just left her boyfriend behind. Greta is a quietly smoldering pre-teen having her own personal issues and Nat is the young innocent observer. Tom's moods are unexplainable and disturbing, frequently trapping his three children in dangerous and confusing situations.Although a low budget film that doesn't make an effort to make the cross country scenery seem like anything other than southern California, it focuses on a strong and sophisticated plot.Director Olivia Silver does a wonderfully balanced and painful job of story-telling.

Hawkes, who has been working in film since the late 80's, seems to be finally getting his due lately: his turns in Winter's Bone, The Sessions, and Martha Marcy May Marlene have all made really good movies great ones. Here, he's turning in good work again as an imperfect, defensive father doing his best to keep his children sane as they move to California.Arcadia centers around a father and his three children (two daughters, and a son) as they travel to the eponymous town on the west coast. By and large, the film is a coming of age story wrapped in a family road-trip plot. It's a small budget indie film, but it never feels like aspects of the movie were hindered for the sake of the budget. What matters here is the characters - how they develop across this 3,000 mile road trip and how they interact with one another. There are few diversions along the way, but they serve more as ways to examine how the father-children dynamic working throughout the road trip.Aside from Hawkes, the performances of the children are really quite good. The youngest child, Nat (played by the excellent Ty Simpkins), has some particularly precocious things to say, but the writing and the performance never lets his interactions come across as trite, contrived, or too on-the-nose. The daughters are good too: Ryan Simpkins' moody teenager never comes across as too angry or unsympathetic, and Kendall Toole plays well as eldest child although she never gets the screen time/lines she deserves.As a debut (Olivia Silver as writer and director), Arcadia is very tastefully crafted and confident. The story here is simple, and it is well paced and shot. The gritty, handheld camera work is reminiscent of Martha Marcy May Marlene, and it serves to make the film's setting look bleak and timeless. Information is divulged slowly throughout the movie, and doing so slowly changes the way characters are seen. The movie gets better as it goes on, and it earns real pathos in its final moments.The best parts of Arcadia come from the small details: the middle daughter, in one letter to her mother writes ""no big arguments"", although you have to look to see it; the father goes behind his daughters and locks their car doors when exiting; Caroline quickly ordering meatloaf at a restaurant (the same meal her father orders). The story easily works as a whole, but what makes this movie worth seeing is its performances and its attention to detail. I would recommend this film to anyone interested in independent cinema or anyone who enjoys character studies.DVD extras:Arcadia comes with a few nice bonuses: biographies of the main cast, a trailer of the movie, and the short film on which the feature is based. The short film, Little Canyon, is more or less a condensed version of Arcadia. Although the cast (with the exception of Toole) is different, many of the shots and dialog are recreated in the feature-length version.",5,Captivating Little Film with a Great Cast,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,2992,"['promotion', 'materials', 'Arcadia', 'centers', 'presence', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'Hawkes', 'who', 'been', 'working', 'film', 'late', '80', 'be', 'finally', 'getting', 'due', 'lately', 'turns', 'Winter', 'Bone', 'Sessions', 'Martha', 'Marcy', 'May', 'Marlene', 'have', 'made', 'really', 'good', 'movies', 'great', 'ones', 'Here', 'turning', 'good', 'work', 'again', 'imperfect', 'defensive', 'father', 'doing', 'best', 'keep', 'children', 'sane', 'move', 'California.Arcadia', 'centers', 'father', 'three', 'children', 'two', 'daughters', 'son', 'travel', 'eponymous', 'town', 'west', 'coast', 'large', 'film', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'wrapped', 'family', 'road-trip', 'plot', 'small', 'budget', 'indie', 'film', 'never', 'aspects', 'movie', 'were', 'hindered', 'sake', 'budget', 'What', 'here', 'characters', 'how', 'develop', '3,000', 'mile', 'road', 'trip', 'how', 'interact', 'one', 'are', 'few', 'diversions', 'way', 'serve', 'more', 'ways', 'examine', 'how', 'father-children', 'dynamic', 'working', 'road', 'trip.Aside', 'Hawkes', 'performances', 'children', 'are', 'really', 'quite', 'good', 'youngest', 'child', 'Nat', 'played', 'excellent', 'Ty', 'Simpkins', 'particularly', 'precocious', 'things', 'say', 'writing', 'performance', 'never', 'interactions', 'come', 'trite', 'contrived', 'too', 'on-the-nose', 'daughters', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'Ryan', 'Simpkins', 'moody', 'teenager', 'never', 'across', 'too', 'angry', 'unsympathetic', 'Kendall', 'Toole', 'well', 'eldest', 'child', 'never', 'screen', 'debut', 'Olivia', 'Silver', 'writer', 'director', 'Arcadia', 'very', 'tastefully', 'crafted', 'confident', 'story', 'here', 'simple', 'well', 'paced', 'shot', 'gritty', 'handheld', 'camera', 'work', 'reminiscent', 'Martha', 'Marcy', 'May', 'Marlene', 'make', 'film', 'setting', 'look', 'bleak', 'timeless', 'Information', 'divulged', 'slowly', 'movie', 'doing', 'so', 'slowly', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'seen', 'movie', 'better', 'real', 'pathos', 'final', 'moments.The', 'best', 'parts', 'Arcadia', 'come', 'small', 'details', 'middle', 'daughter', 'one', 'letter', 'mother', 'big', 'arguments', 'have', 'look', 'see', 'father', 'daughters', 'locks', 'car', 'doors', 'when', 'exiting', 'Caroline', 'quickly', 'ordering', 'meatloaf', 'restaurant', 'same', 'meal', 'father', 'orders', 'story', 'easily', 'whole', 'what', 'movie', 'seeing', 'performances', 'attention', 'detail', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'interested', 'independent', 'cinema', 'anyone', 'who', 'character', 'studies.DVD', 'extras', 'Arcadia', 'few', 'nice', 'bonuses', 'biographies', 'main', 'cast', 'trailer', 'movie', 'short', 'film', 'feature', 'based', 'short', 'film', 'Little', 'Canyon', 'more', 'less', 'condensed', 'version', 'Arcadia', 'cast', 'exception', 'Toole', 'different', 'many', 'shots', 'dialog', 'are', 'recreated', 'feature-length', 'version']",Arcadia
1637623,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B00BQNSJZS,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 2]","Tom has been unemployed for some time, when he decides to pack his three kids up in his old station wagon and drive to Arcadia in California, where he says he has the best offer ever for a job. This entails a 2,800 mile road trip from New England. First off they leave the dog; he tells the kids that their mom will bring him when she comes.His eldest daughter Caroline is more upset about leaving her boyfriend behind, Greta who is twelve is having the worst time, questioning everything and having a constant refrain of `when will mom join us'. Little nine year old Nat is just full of verve and seemingly enjoying the adventure with a special promise of seeing the grand Canyon. It is clear that Tom is having problems, with furtive calls on the phone and mood swings that serious anger management might be needed to address. The scenery changes and the atmosphere gets ever charged as pieces of the puzzle that Greta is trying to figure out, start to make themselves tangible through glimpses of evidence and overheard conversation, and still the road goes on.This is a beautifully simple tale on first glance, then the layers start to get pulled back and you realise that a quietly moving story is developing and that the deep emotion involved with families runs very deep indeed. Director Olivia Silver has made a very moving and engaging film, which is based on her 20 minute short film `Little Canyon' which is also included on this disc. The performances from all are excellent especially John Hawkes as Tom (`Lincoln' and `American Gangster') he comes across as completely believable despite his sometimes erratic and borderline violent behaviour. The kids are great too Ty Simpkins as Nat is terrific as indeed is Ryan Simpkins who at the age of 14 is too talented by half and can only get better with age, I hope.With a run time of 91 minutes, it is both well balanced and paced, sometimes when a short is made into a feature it can seem to be a bit laboured, but thankfully not in this case as the story has been broadened and embellished, but in a rather good way. Quick mention of the cinematography, which is actually excellent but understated - you only notice the nice touches on subsequent viewing, which is always appreciated. I received a copy for review purposes for which I am grateful as this is a wonderfully accomplished film that I can only recommend.",4,Moving Coming of age Road Trip,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,2378,"['Tom', 'been', 'unemployed', 'time', 'when', 'pack', 'three', 'kids', 'up', 'old', 'station', 'wagon', 'drive', 'Arcadia', 'California', 'where', 'best', 'offer', 'ever', 'job', '2,800', 'mile', 'road', 'trip', 'New', 'England', 'First', 'leave', 'dog', 'kids', 'mom', 'will', 'bring', 'when', 'comes.His', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Caroline', 'more', 'upset', 'leaving', 'boyfriend', 'Greta', 'who', 'twelve', 'having', 'worst', 'time', 'questioning', 'everything', 'having', 'constant', 'refrain', 'when', 'will', 'mom', 'join', 'Little', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'Nat', 'just', 'full', 'verve', 'seemingly', 'enjoying', 'adventure', 'special', 'promise', 'seeing', 'grand', 'Canyon', 'clear', 'Tom', 'having', 'problems', 'furtive', 'calls', 'phone', 'mood', 'swings', 'serious', 'anger', 'management', 'might', 'be', 'needed', 'address', 'scenery', 'changes', 'atmosphere', 'ever', 'charged', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'Greta', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'start', 'make', 'tangible', 'glimpses', 'evidence', 'overheard', 'conversation', 'still', 'road', 'on.This', 'beautifully', 'simple', 'tale', 'first', 'glance', 'then', 'layers', 'start', 'get', 'pulled', 'back', 'realise', 'quietly', 'moving', 'story', 'developing', 'deep', 'emotion', 'involved', 'families', 'very', 'deep', 'indeed', 'Director', 'Olivia', 'Silver', 'made', 'very', 'moving', 'engaging', 'film', 'based', '20', 'minute', 'short', 'film', 'Little', 'Canyon', 'also', 'included', 'disc', 'performances', 'are', 'excellent', 'especially', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'Tom', 'Lincoln', 'American', 'Gangster', 'completely', 'believable', 'sometimes', 'erratic', 'borderline', 'violent', 'behaviour', 'kids', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'Ty', 'Simpkins', 'Nat', 'terrific', 'indeed', 'Ryan', 'Simpkins', 'who', 'age', '14', 'too', 'talented', 'half', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'better', 'age', 'hope.With', 'run', 'time', '91', 'minutes', 'well', 'balanced', 'paced', 'sometimes', 'when', 'short', 'made', 'feature', 'can', 'seem', 'be', 'bit', 'laboured', 'thankfully', 'not', 'case', 'story', 'been', 'broadened', 'embellished', 'rather', 'good', 'way', 'Quick', 'mention', 'cinematography', 'actually', 'excellent', 'understated', 'only', 'notice', 'nice', 'touches', 'subsequent', 'viewing', 'always', 'appreciated', 'received', 'copy', 'review', 'purposes', 'am', 'grateful', 'wonderfully', 'accomplished', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'recommend']",Arcadia

We have a father, two daughters and a son traveling to California, but the mother is missing. He tells them mom will soon be with them, but somehow we know that is not going to happen.Even with the excellent acting it is hard to relate or even sympathize with the characters, especially with no real addition to the storyline.The acting is superb by everyone. What is missing is a soundtrack that is even. At points when the actors are talking softly it is hard to discern everything that they are saying which makes one feel they are missing out on part of the plot. There are no subtitles to help out with this problem either.There is an interesting bonus 20 minute film that is the basis for which the longer movie was created. . There are also bios of the director and actors and a movie trailer.I was asked to review this DVD and given a copy for examination.
