928955,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000AMJG5I,andy8047,"[23, 25]","There is nothing much different than what happened during season 3. However,Zara Cully as George Jefferson's(Sherman Hemsley) mother Olivia,passed away in February 1978 at age 86. The death of Olivia was written into the series. The Jeffersons' son Lionel(Damon Evans) and Jenny Willis(Berlinda Tolbert) are still husband and wife. Jay Hammer joins the cast as Jenny's brother Allan Willis,the ""white sheep"" of the family. Allan has more of his father Tom's(Franklin Cover) skin,while Jenny has more of Tom's wife Helen's(the late Roxie Roker). Allan was a guest character in one episode from the first season,played by Andrew Rubin. George still occasionally dances on English neighbor Harry Bentley's(Paul Benedict) back when it acts up. This would also be the last season for DE. After DE's departure,Lionel would be occasionally mentioned until Mike Evans(no relation to Damon),who was Lionel originally,returned for the 1979-80 and 1980-81 seasons. ME first played Lionel on a recurring basis on the Jeffersons' parent show All In The Family. One highlight from this season is where George and his wife Louise(the late Isabel Sanford) are being threatened with homicide. George and Louise were tied to two(one each) of their kitchen table chairs. We still hear ""honky"" and ""zebra"" coming out of George's mouth. The ""honkies"" are Tom,Harry,doorman Ralph Hart(a recurring character played by Ned Wertimer) and landlord H.W. Whittendale. The ""zebras"",of course, are Jenny and Allan. In George's eyes,Allan is ""missing his stripes"". That's what George said in that first season episode,which in fact,was the thirteenth episode of the series and the first season finale. I dedicate this item to the memories of Cully,Roker and Sanford. Roker succumbed to breast cancer at age 66 in December 1995 and Sanford succumbed to natural causes at age 86,like Cully,in July 2004. By the way,Marla Gibbs as the Jeffersons' live-in housekeeper Florence Johnston is officially a Jeffersons cast member. I incorrectly mentioned that in the review for the season 3 set. It just so happened that during the third season,Florence was evicted from her apartment and sought residence with the Jeffersons.",5,Isabel and Sherman are movin' on up to season 4!,1123027200,"08 3, 2005",2005,2186,"['nothing', 'much', 'different', 'what', 'happened', 'season', '3', 'However', 'Zara', 'Cully', 'George', 'Jefferson', 'Sherman', 'Hemsley', 'mother', 'Olivia', 'passed', 'away', 'February', '1978', 'age', '86', 'death', 'Olivia', 'was', 'written', 'series', 'Jeffersons', 'son', 'Lionel', 'Damon', 'Evans', 'Jenny', 'Willis', 'Berlinda', 'Tolbert', 'are', 'still', 'husband', 'wife', 'Jay', 'Hammer', 'cast', 'Jenny', 'brother', 'Allan', 'Willis', 'white', 'sheep', 'family', 'Allan', 'more', 'father', 'Tom', 'Franklin', 'Cover', 'skin', 'Jenny', 'more', 'Tom', 'wife', 'Helen', 'late', 'Roxie', 'Roker', 'Allan', 'was', 'guest', 'character', 'one', 'episode', 'first', 'season', 'played', 'Andrew', 'Rubin', 'George', 'still', 'occasionally', 'dances', 'English', 'neighbor', 'Harry', 'Bentley', 'Paul', 'Benedict', 'back', 'when', 'up', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'last', 'season', 'DE', 'DE', 'departure', 'Lionel', 'would', 'be', 'occasionally', 'mentioned', 'Mike', 'Evans', 'relation', 'Damon', 'who', 'was', 'Lionel', 'originally', 'returned', '1979-80', '1980-81', 'seasons', 'ME', 'first', 'played', 'Lionel', 'recurring', 'basis', 'Jeffersons', 'parent', 'show', 'All', 'Family', 'One', 'highlight', 'season', 'where', 'George', 'wife', 'Louise', 'late', 'Isabel', 'Sanford', 'are', 'being', 'threatened', 'homicide', 'George', 'Louise', 'were', 'tied', 'two', 'one', 'kitchen', 'table', 'chairs', 'still', 'hear', 'honky', 'zebra', 'coming', 'George', 'mouth', 'honkies', 'are', 'Tom', 'Harry', 'doorman', 'Ralph', 'Hart', 'recurring', 'character', 'played', 'Ned', 'Wertimer', 'landlord', 'H.W', 'Whittendale', 'zebras', 'course', 'are', 'Jenny', 'Allan', 'George', 'eyes', 'Allan', 'missing', 'stripes', 'what', 'George', 'said', 'first', 'season', 'episode', 'fact', 'was', 'thirteenth', 'episode', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'finale', 'dedicate', 'item', 'memories', 'Cully', 'Roker', 'Sanford', 'Roker', 'succumbed', 'breast', 'cancer', 'age', '66', 'December', '1995', 'Sanford', 'succumbed', 'natural', 'causes', 'age', '86', 'Cully', 'July', '2004', 'way', 'Marla', 'Gibbs', 'Jeffersons', 'live-in', 'housekeeper', 'Florence', 'Johnston', 'officially', 'Jeffersons', 'cast', 'member', 'incorrectly', 'mentioned', 'review', 'season', '3', 'set', 'just', 'so', 'happened', 'third', 'season', 'Florence', 'was', 'evicted', 'apartment', 'sought', 'residence', 'Jeffersons']",N/A

In this hilarious season of this landmark sitcom, George learns an old Navy pal is in town, only to find things have changed, with Eddie Stokes now being named Edie Stokes in the episode ""Once A Friend"". Louise has a difficult time in believing George, & this is just one of many must-see moments during this pivotal season. Season Four is pivotal in that this is Damon Evans' third & final season in the role of Lionel Jefferson. What's remarkable, is both Lionels, played by Mike & Damon Evans (no relation), appeared in exactly the same number of episodes apiece (39 episodes each). We're also introduced to two new characters this season - Marcus Henderson (played by Ernest Harden, Jr.) & Leroy (last name unknown - played by Vernon Washington). Marcus makes his first appearance in the episode ""George's Help"", where Louise, through a youth employment program offered by her employer, the Help Center, convinces George to hire a young upstart from George & Louise's old neighborhood, only to find Marcus is in trouble for theft, but George continues to keep the young man in his hire. George, concerned that he won't be remembered after he's gone, has a statue made of his likeness in ""George's Legacy"", only to be mocked by his friends. There's a special Christmas episode where George visits his old apartment complex in Harlem, finding sentimental value in that he's been secretly sending money & gifts to the family living at that address for years, unbeknownst to Louise. George also opens his own office in the two-part season opener ""The Grand Opening"", complete with a surprising, cliffhanger-type plot that's a must-see. There's also a three-part episode that appears near the end of this season titled ""George & Louise In A Bind"", featuring retrospective moments from ""All in the Family"" & ""The Jeffersons"". This would also be Zara Cully's final season, as she passed away mid-season. Zara's last appearance was in the episode ""The Last Leaf"", where Louise misplaces an important keepsake. In summation, there are many happy & bittersweet moments this season, as ""The Jeffersons - The Complete Fourth Season"" is perhaps the most climactic & pivotal season of the sitcom's eleven-season run. Also, this is the first season where Marla Gibbs appears in the show's opening credits, although she officially became part of the cast the previous season as the Jeffersons' sassy, wisecracking maid. This is such an important, milestone season, that it mustn't go without notice in your all-important DVD library.

928964,A1QJHZUUMKZYZG,B000AMJG5I,"K. J. Bryant ""peachycream""","[12, 12]","The Jeffersons remains one of the greatest TV shows in history. Although it was a comedy, the show dealt with real issues (like racism), self reliance (Geoge Jefferson being a business owner), serious problems (crime) and etc. This season has always been one of my favorite because George increasingly struggles to connect his past with his present/future (for example, watch 'Once A Friend', '984 W. 124th St.,Apt 5C', and 'George's Legacy'. Louise leaves her poor past behind, but continues to be a sweet, classy lady (watch 'George's Help'). Florence continues to become an important part of the show, including stealing some scenes (watch the funny 'Florence's Union'). Speaking of 'Florence's Union' that episode has one of the funniest and most memorable line ever...""Let the door knob hit you"",...(you know the rest)!On a sadder note, Mother Jefferson (Zara Cully) passes away this season. I believe her last appearance was the 'The Last Leaf' and you could tell she was very ill. She had lost that spark, but not her sass. I didn't realize how brave she was to continue to work while in pain (she had cancer), until now. The show (kind of) paid tribute to her during episode 24 'George and Louise In A Bind, Pt.2', but did not mention she had died or did not do a storyline around her death. I never understood why because she was a strong part of the show (and George's life). I can't recall them even acknowledging her death, until seasons later. This was a first sign of CBS lack of respect for this show and the cast. This brings me to another point, there are no extras, no tributes to the stars who have passed on, no behind the scenes footage and no interviews on this DVD. Columbia videos, we have lost four cast members, and you never gave the show a proper send off (which is considered one of the most shocking action in TV History) the least you can do for the fans is allow the remaining cast to have their say and pay tribute to Ms. Cully, Ms. Roker, Ms. Sanford and Mr. Cover.",5,One of the Best Shows Ever!!,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,1999,"['Jeffersons', 'one', 'greatest', 'TV', 'shows', 'history', 'was', 'comedy', 'show', 'real', 'issues', 'racism', 'self', 'reliance', 'Geoge', 'Jefferson', 'being', 'business', 'owner', 'serious', 'problems', 'crime', 'etc', 'season', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'George', 'increasingly', 'connect', 'past', 'present/future', 'example', 'watch', 'Friend', 'W.', '124th', 'St.', 'Apt', '5C', 'Legacy', 'Louise', 'poor', 'past', 'be', 'sweet', 'classy', 'lady', 'watch', ""'George"", 'Help', 'Florence', 'become', 'important', 'part', 'show', 'including', 'stealing', 'scenes', 'watch', 'funny', ""'Florence"", 'Union', 'Speaking', ""'Florence"", 'Union', 'episode', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'memorable', 'line', 'ever', 'Let', 'door', 'knob', 'hit', 'know', 'rest', 'sadder', 'note', 'Mother', 'Jefferson', 'Zara', 'Cully', 'away', 'season', 'believe', 'last', 'appearance', 'was', ""'The"", 'Last', 'Leaf', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'very', 'ill.', 'had', 'lost', 'spark', 'not', 'sass', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'brave', 'was', 'continue', 'work', 'pain', 'had', 'cancer', 'now', 'show', 'kind', 'paid', 'tribute', 'episode', '24', ""'George"", 'Louise', 'A', 'Bind', 'Pt.2', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'had', 'died', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'storyline', 'death', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'was', 'strong', 'part', 'show', 'George', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'even', 'acknowledging', 'death', 'seasons', 'later', 'was', 'first', 'sign', 'CBS', 'lack', 'respect', 'show', 'cast', 'point', 'are', 'extras', 'tributes', 'stars', 'who', 'have', 'passed', 'scenes', 'footage', 'interviews', 'DVD', 'Columbia', 'videos', 'have', 'lost', 'four', 'cast', 'members', 'never', 'gave', 'show', 'proper', 'send', 'considered', 'one', 'most', 'shocking', 'action', 'TV', 'History', 'least', 'can', 'do', 'fans', 'remaining', 'cast', 'have', 'say', 'pay', 'tribute', 'Ms.', 'Cully', 'Ms.', 'Roker', 'Ms.', 'Sanford', 'Mr.', 'Cover']",N/A

928973,A303U1MOXG5R1F,B000AMJG5I,Sylviastel,"[0, 1]","The Jeffersons television show was a huge success and would have continued had the CBS network allowed them another season. The same group of crew members behind the Jeffersons moved on to Married with Children. The Jeffersons is set on the Upper East Side of New York City with Sherman Helmsley (who deserved an Emmy) for his role as George Jefferson, the loud-mouthed obnoxious dry cleaner entreprenuer with a small chain of 7 stores. They have the wonderful Marla Gibbs as Florence Johnston, their live-in housekeeper, and of course the amazing Isabel Sanford as Louise ""Weezy"" Jefferson as George's wife. As Weezy, Sanford not only holds her own but is responsible for much of the common sense in the Jeffersons household. Of course, their building has their share of neighbors like the interracial couple, the Willises, who become family when their daughter Jenny married the Jeffersons' son, Lionel. After that, we don't see much of the younger Jeffersons. Paul Benedict plays British neighbor and bachelor who lives next door who uses George's feet to help him with his back problem. The Willises played by Franklin Cover and Roxie Roker (Lenny Kravitz's mother) play a thankless role because interracial romances are quite rare to see in the 1970s. They do exist but as Michele Greene from L.A. Law realized that a lesbian kiss got less attention than her interracial kiss with Blair Underwood, an African American actor. Of course, those prejudices still exist but I think the Willises helped set precedent about interracial couples as being real and non-threatening as well to the community like the way that homosexual and lesbian couples are seen today. The Willises make us more tolerant or helps educate the audience. I can't forget Zara Cully who is on less in this season possibly because of her failing health. Her role as Mother Jefferson and criticisms of her daughter-in-law Louise are unforgettable. Marla Gibbs helped establish the same collaboration with Sherman Helmsley. In this season, the grand opening of Jefferson offices in a two episode deal has a kidnapping and ransom of Mrs. Jefferson but the kidnappers napped the wrong woman. The show also tackled transgender issue with George's old navy buddy, Eddie, who now goes by Edie. Some shows might be tacky but the Jeffersons like their sister show, All in the Family, did a subtle but brilliant job and Veronica Redd does an outstanding guest performance in this role. The next episode is entitled George's Help which features Louise getting involved at the Help Center and helping hiring Marcus who becomes like another son to George in the process. Who can forget George's legacy where he creates a bust of himself? The episodes are wonderful but my only grievance with Jeffersons and Good Times is that they don't have subtitles like French and Spanish but either way, I wouldn't give them up for the world.",5,Fish don't fry in the kitchen!
