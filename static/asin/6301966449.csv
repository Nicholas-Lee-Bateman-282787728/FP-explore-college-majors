277180,A2WLZD9BY669HY,6301966449,Candace Scott,"[7, 15]","Though &quot;Equus&quot; was masterful when seen on the broadway stage, it suffers dreadfully in this screen translation. It's curious because Sidney Lumet had a winning screen track record and Burton had honed his role as Dysart on the NY stage, after taking over the role from Tony Perkins. But something is sadly amiss here.Some of the problems are the dank, sterile way in which many scenes were filmed. The viewer almost becomes claustrophic when Dysart interogates and analyzes the boy, ably played by Peter Firth. The sets seem absurdly cheap for such a production, with sofas, chairs and walls reminscent of something out of &quot;General Hospital.&quot; The stable scene where Firth blinds the horses takes the concept of gratuitous violence to a new level. Again, this scene worked beautifuly on stage, but is numbing and troubling when viewed in the movie version.Burton's performance was widely praised at the time of release and he was nominated for his seventh Academy Award. He didn't win (Richard Dreyfuss won instead). The performance is uneven and Burton never seems completely comfortable in the role. Ultimately, the viewer is confused with an overly avant-garde approach to the production and the fact that it's hard to care much for boy or his predicament.

277181,A2QZQBINBG6B5N,6301966449,Charles S. Houser,"[35, 39]","Hollywood gets mixed reviews on its ability to present plausible psychiatrist-patient relationships on film. On the tacky end of the scale are DAVID AND LISA and FINAL ANALYSIS; on the &quot;deeply moving&quot; end of the scale are ORDINARY PEOPLE and GOOD WILL HUNTING. Most, like THE THREE FACES OF EVE fall somewhere in the middle--interesting though unsubtle stories that reduce the patient's neurosis to a single mystery that needs to be unlocked by an indefatiguable professional who is egoless and has the blank personality to prove it.Sidney Lumet's adaptation of the Peter Shaffer's stage play EQUUS is exceptional for its ability to transport to film the full emotional complexity and intensity of a psychiatrist's relationship with one of his patients. And this is done almost entirely through the skill of the actors: Richard Burton as the psychiatrist Dr. Martin Dysart, Peter Firth as the disturbed stable boy who inexplicably blinded several of the horses in his care, Colin Blakely and Joan Plowright as the boy's religiously incompatible parents, and Eileen Atkins as a judge who has asked Dr. Dysart to take on this challenging case. This is not to minimize other contributions--the cinematography is exceedingly intelligent and unobtrusive. It's simply to say that Lumet seems to have realized that he had assembled a dream cast and made every effort to stay out of their way and to let each actor shine. Burton's performance is perhaps the best of his film career. Though intense at times, he is completely devoid of the stagey &quot;haminess&quot; that has marred some of his other film performances. Firth, as the patient, moves easily from jingle-singing dissociated boy, to surly rebellious youth, to a sort of highly eroticized mythic being. It is truly fascinating to watch. Because the psychiatrist has issues of his own, and because the story is as much about his coming to terms with his own demons as with those of his patient, EQUUS is not your typical Hollywood psychotherapy movie. It delves into the mythology and religion as well as the human condition. In the end, the film gives you a lot to think about after you've hit the stop button on your remote.

277183,A30AO422P01XK0,6301966449,Daniel Mackler,"[5, 8]","Equus offers a gripping view into the mind of a disturbed and at times psychotic teenage boy - and into the psyche of his conflicted therapist.  Although the movie is well worth watching, I only gave it four stars because of several of its flaws.My main criticism is that the movie strayed into idealization of the therapist and the therapy.  Yes, the therapist (played brilliantly by Richard Burton) was passionate, earnest, committed, and struggling to be honest both with himself and the boy, and yes, the movie partially succeeds at highlighting the therapist's vulnerability, hypocrisy, and stuckness, but at times he violated the boy in ways the movie not only didn't address, but even presented as being therapeutically necessary.For starters, Equus minimized the therapist's sporadically combative - and thus untherapeutic - behavior.  At points he rejected the already abused and frightened boy (threw him out of the office for not behaving ""properly""), manipulated him (hypnotized him on the sly - as if the boy, desperate for love, could refuse!), tricked him (gave him a false ""truth drug"" - with false promises of a cure - to make him talk), and even brutalized him (screamed at him and bullied him to force him into revealing the horrors of his past for the sake of ""healing"").  Although this made for good drama it utterly fails to show, much less even hint at, how a slow and gentle and safe therapeutic approach could have so much more effectively helped the boy discover and integrate his true self.  Forget all the trickery and rage and pressure to make the boy ""normal"" - which only repeat the horrors perpetrated on him by his troubled parents - just honor him and honor his natural healing process.My experience has shown me that the greatest results are achieved with no therapeutic violation of the patient.  Although the ""blast your way to healing"" approach plays to the public's idea of an actively engaged, virtuoso therapist who stops at nothing to ""save the patient,"" it disguises (much more than the movie addressed) a therapist's grandiosity, insecurity, hidden agenda, impatience, and split-off self-hatred - and risks terrible consequences for the patient.  Had the boy killed himself during or after the therapy - a likelihood which struck me several times in the film - I would have partially blamed the therapist.I was not surprised that after the boy finally admitted to blinding the horses, and admitted his back story that drove him to do it, he had a complete breakdown and went into catatonic shock - and ""needed"" to be drugged.  And this is considered good therapy, even healing?  Hardly.  For starters, it's based on the fanciful idea that simply getting someone to admit what happened to them, by hook or by crook, is enough to catalyze healing.  If only that were the case!  This is where the psychological detective story element of the movie took precedence over a real chance to demonstrate good therapy.And then there is the nudity.  A little might have been relevant, but it was gratuitous to repeatedly show the teenage boy's fully naked body in the film - much less to show overt sex between him and the girl who participated in driving him over the edge.  But perhaps the biggest violation was that the psychiatrist's manipulations got the boy to undress to full nudity right in a therapy session!  Talk about malpractice!Although they initially presented this therapist as being the best there is (the only therapist ""within a hundred miles"" who could help the boy), I could only hope this wasn't the case.  And if it was, what a terrible - yet probably realistic - indictment of the modern mental health system.",4,"Excellent Movie, Partially Flawed Therapy",1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,3666,"['Equus', 'gripping', 'view', 'mind', 'disturbed', 'times', 'psychotic', 'teenage', 'boy', 'psyche', 'conflicted', 'therapist', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'only', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'several', 'flaws.My', 'main', 'criticism', 'movie', 'strayed', 'idealization', 'therapist', 'therapy', 'Yes', 'therapist', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'was', 'passionate', 'earnest', 'committed', 'struggling', 'be', 'honest', 'boy', 'yes', 'movie', 'partially', 'highlighting', 'therapist', 'vulnerability', 'hypocrisy', 'stuckness', 'times', 'violated', 'boy', 'ways', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'did', ""n't"", 'address', 'even', 'presented', 'being', 'therapeutically', 'necessary.For', 'starters', 'Equus', 'minimized', 'therapist', 'sporadically', 'combative', 'thus', 'untherapeutic', 'behavior', 'points', 'rejected', 'already', 'abused', 'frightened', 'boy', 'threw', 'office', 'not', 'behaving', 'properly', 'manipulated', 'hypnotized', 'sly', 'boy', 'desperate', 'love', 'could', 'refuse', 'tricked', 'gave', 'false', 'truth', 'drug', 'false', 'promises', 'cure', 'make', 'talk', 'even', 'brutalized', 'screamed', 'bullied', 'force', 'revealing', 'horrors', 'past', 'sake', 'healing', 'made', 'good', 'drama', 'utterly', 'show', 'much', 'less', 'even', 'hint', 'how', 'slow', 'gentle', 'safe', 'therapeutic', 'approach', 'could', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'effectively', 'helped', 'boy', 'discover', 'integrate', 'true', 'self', 'Forget', 'trickery', 'rage', 'pressure', 'make', 'boy', 'normal', 'only', 'repeat', 'horrors', 'perpetrated', 'troubled', 'parents', 'just', 'honor', 'honor', 'natural', 'healing', 'process.My', 'experience', 'shown', 'greatest', 'results', 'are', 'achieved', 'therapeutic', 'violation', 'patient', 'blast', 'way', 'healing', 'approach', 'public', 'idea', 'actively', 'engaged', 'virtuoso', 'therapist', 'who', 'nothing', 'save', 'patient', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'addressed', 'therapist', 'grandiosity', 'insecurity', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'impatience', 'split-off', 'self-hatred', 'risks', 'terrible', 'consequences', 'patient', 'Had', 'boy', 'killed', 'therapy', 'likelihood', 'struck', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'partially', 'blamed', 'therapist.I', 'was', 'not', 'surprised', 'boy', 'finally', 'admitted', 'blinding', 'horses', 'admitted', 'back', 'story', 'drove', 'do', 'had', 'complete', 'breakdown', 'went', 'catatonic', 'shock', 'needed', 'be', 'drugged', 'considered', 'good', 'therapy', 'even', 'healing', 'Hardly', 'starters', 'based', 'fanciful', 'idea', 'simply', 'getting', 'someone', 'admit', 'what', 'happened', 'hook', 'crook', 'enough', 'catalyze', 'healing', 'only', 'were', 'case', 'where', 'psychological', 'detective', 'story', 'element', 'movie', 'took', 'precedence', 'real', 'chance', 'demonstrate', 'good', 'therapy.And', 'then', 'nudity', 'little', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'relevant', 'was', 'gratuitous', 'repeatedly', 'show', 'teenage', 'boy', 'fully', 'naked', 'body', 'film', 'much', 'less', 'show', 'overt', 'sex', 'girl', 'who', 'participated', 'driving', 'edge', 'perhaps', 'biggest', 'violation', 'was', 'psychiatrist', 'manipulations', 'got', 'boy', 'undress', 'full', 'nudity', 'right', 'therapy', 'session', 'Talk', 'malpractice', 'initially', 'presented', 'therapist', 'being', 'best', 'only', 'therapist', 'hundred', 'miles', 'who', 'could', 'help', 'boy', 'could', 'only', 'hope', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'was', 'what', 'terrible', 'yet', 'probably', 'realistic', 'indictment', 'modern', 'mental', 'health', 'system']",Equus VHS
277184,A2GYX971VETQBV,6301966449,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[7, 8]","""Equus"" restored my faith in Sidney Lumet after watching a few of his films that bombed.  Lumet transfers the stage play beautifully to the screen, exploring an interesting case of a boy who has blinded six horses.  Richard Burton is magnificent and one of the only actors that can carry on long-winded dialogues with conviction.  Equally able is the deranged boy (played by Peter Firth) who cross-examines Burton, knocking him off his feet in a similar manner to Matt Damon in ""Good Will Hunting.""""Equus"" explores what it means to be normal.  Burton's character realizes that being normal, to a certain degree, is having abnormalities.  Peter Firth's character has a worship that is more passionate and alive than most human beings ever feel-certainly more than Burton's character.  Burton longs to have the boy's passion and yet realizes that he is trying to free the boy from these feelings as he is doing so.  He muses over the meaning of his life and the therapy he gives.  If he can never understand ""why"" a child acts the way it does, is there any point to therapy?While this movie starts out with a completely absurd and twisted plot, it eventually fades into a very believable plot line.  As Burton pulls the information from Firth's head and we witness the boy's instable home life and threatening religious background, the plot becomes normal and we come to understand the boy's situation.  The movie becomes clear as the boy's troubles become clear.  The effect of this is that we experience the therapy along with Peter Firth.  This is masterfully done and Lumet should be applauded.My only complaint about the movie is that it is a little long-winded.  However, the dialogue is top-notch and the acting is incredible.

The scene where Strang blinded those horses, well, I couldn't look at it. I intensely dislike seeing animals harmed for any reason other than food or self-defense. For much of the movie, I sat there invoking curses upon what I interpreted as a betrayal of my expectations.But then, Dr. Dysart (brilliantly portrayed by Richard Burton) shared his revelation about his patient. He understood that, as lost and in pain as the boy Strang was, as deviant as his behavior was, as horrible and unspeakable as his crime was, there was, under it, a finger pointing at the dull mediocrity that the rest of us live in. Most people sleepwalk through their lives. No passion, no joy, no pain, no purpose. These agonies and ecstasies are essential to the fullness of a human life. Yet, Strang was a product of a society that could not provide even a passable facimilie of these human feelings. Thus, the law of conservation of energy being equally applicable to psychology, that energy had to go somewhere. For Strang, he fabricated a false idol to which he attached sexual imagery - yet another energy he was ill equipped to channel. This disingenuous idolatry was the only passion in his life, and he took it as far as it could go.Dysart was then forced to face his own ugly truth. That of an utterly empty life. Strang's mocking looks told him, when Dysart could finally understand, that while Dysart was comfortably trapped in a mediocre world wherein he would look at drawings of centaurs in dusty, clinically devised books, Strang was running wild in the night trying to become one.It was when I realized this that I understood that the unforgivable attacks on the innocent horses was, on the one hand, incidental. On the other hand, it was the inevitable result of the boy's headlong dive into his passion. His incapacity to resolve the paradox he was forced into by circumstance combined with temperament and inclination. He was a moth that fell in love with the flame, and was consumed by it.This is the difference between the millions of boxing fans who sit in front of the TV drinking beer and watching the title fight, and those few who go out into the ring and get beaten to a pulp in a real fight. This is the difference between those who attend the occasional religious service on holidays or whenever, and those who immerse themselves in their spiritual practice irregardless of the cost. They have a real love, a real passion, and no matter what, they are living a real life; while most simply exist as automatons without minds, without hearts, without spirit.This, I believe, is what ""Equus"" is saying.",4,A good stiff jolt,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",2009,2773,"['borrowed', 'movie', 'library', 'apart', 'description', 'case', 'knew', 'nothing', 'about', 'it.Well', 'scenes', 'pagan', 'bestiality', 'were', 'disturbing', 'enough', 'scene', 'where', 'Strang', 'blinded', 'horses', 'well', 'could', ""n't"", 'look', 'intensely', 'seeing', 'animals', 'harmed', 'reason', 'other', 'food', 'self-defense', 'much', 'movie', 'sat', 'there', 'invoking', 'curses', 'what', 'interpreted', 'betrayal', 'expectations.But', 'then', 'Dr.', 'Dysart', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'shared', 'revelation', 'patient', 'understood', 'that', 'lost', 'pain', 'boy', 'Strang', 'was', 'as', 'deviant', 'behavior', 'was', 'horrible', 'unspeakable', 'crime', 'was', 'was', 'finger', 'pointing', 'dull', 'mediocrity', 'rest', 'live', 'Most', 'people', 'sleepwalk', 'lives', 'passion', 'joy', 'pain', 'purpose', 'agonies', 'ecstasies', 'are', 'essential', 'fullness', 'human', 'life', 'Strang', 'was', 'product', 'society', 'could', 'not', 'provide', 'even', 'passable', 'facimilie', 'human', 'feelings', 'Thus', 'law', 'conservation', 'energy', 'being', 'equally', 'applicable', 'psychology', 'energy', 'had', 'go', 'somewhere', 'Strang', 'fabricated', 'false', 'idol', 'attached', 'sexual', 'imagery', 'yet', 'energy', 'was', 'ill', 'equipped', 'channel', 'disingenuous', 'idolatry', 'was', 'only', 'passion', 'life', 'took', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'go.Dysart', 'was', 'then', 'forced', 'face', 'own', 'ugly', 'truth', 'utterly', 'empty', 'life', 'Strang', 'mocking', 'told', 'when', 'Dysart', 'could', 'finally', 'understand', 'Dysart', 'was', 'comfortably', 'trapped', 'mediocre', 'world', 'wherein', 'would', 'look', 'drawings', 'centaurs', 'dusty', 'clinically', 'devised', 'books', 'Strang', 'was', 'running', 'wild', 'night', 'trying', 'become', 'one.It', 'was', 'when', 'realized', 'understood', 'unforgivable', 'attacks', 'innocent', 'horses', 'was', 'one', 'hand', 'incidental', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'inevitable', 'result', 'boy', 'headlong', 'dive', 'passion', 'incapacity', 'resolve', 'paradox', 'was', 'forced', 'circumstance', 'combined', 'temperament', 'inclination', 'was', 'moth', 'fell', 'love', 'flame', 'was', 'consumed', 'it.This', 'difference', 'millions', 'boxing', 'fans', 'who', 'sit', 'front', 'TV', 'drinking', 'beer', 'watching', 'title', 'fight', 'few', 'who', 'go', 'out', 'ring', 'get', 'beaten', 'pulp', 'real', 'fight', 'difference', 'who', 'attend', 'occasional', 'religious', 'service', 'holidays', 'whenever', 'who', 'immerse', 'spiritual', 'practice', 'irregardless', 'cost', 'have', 'real', 'love', 'real', 'passion', 'matter', 'what', 'are', 'living', 'real', 'life', 'most', 'simply', 'exist', 'automatons', 'minds', 'hearts', 'spirit.This', 'believe', 'what', 'Equus', 'saying']",Equus VHS

At the same time...  soliloquies says something too.  This felt like a stage play adaptation.  There are lots of long speaking bits and very few settings.  I'm not against adapted stage plays, but this didn't feel like a movie, and it's strong points made me more curious about seeing it as a play than anything else.Equus unfolds from a therapist asked to analyze and work with a teenage boy who had a seemingly normal life, who suddenly and for no apparent reason gouged out the eyes of several horses at a stable where he worked part time.  The therapist, meanwhile narrates about his dreams and oddities, and finds in the teen parrallels to himself.  The movie is as much about the therapist as about the teen.Something that for me was weak about this movie is that it seemed to be trying way too hard to be sexual.  The teen is naked in approaching half his scenes.  He rides horses naked.  He stands naked next to horses and pets them during some long narration.  He falls back completely naked into blackness in some type of visual methaphor over and over again during some long narration.  He gets naked in therapy, which I'm assuming is OK only because this is set in England, and therapy is run differently there.  Beyond the copious nudity, some of the language is, once again, over the top.  In a flashback showing his quirks preceeding the blinding, he's whipping himself (probably naked here too) and screaming some type of geneology for Equus (his personal god).  This geneology is a bit over the top as most of it reads like ""Pankus begat Spankus...  Spankus begat Equus.""  Seriously, ""Spankus"" is in there.I recommend avoiding this movie, although maybe be open to it as a play.

Something, however, went horribly wrong in translating the play to the screen. Nothing seems to work. For example, the blinding of the horses in the stage production is totally believable and so overpowering. Using men wearing metal horses' heads works completely. The similar scenes in the movie with actual horses are so brutal as to be almost unwatchable. The nudity is not at all gratuituous in the play but seems unnecessary in the movie adaptation. The spare set complements the acting in the play and is so effective. That is all of course lost in the movie version. Martin Dysart's talking to the audience is so moving in the play; in the movie it comes off simply as both artificial and boring. (It doesn't help matters that Burton has three volumnes: loud, much louder and too loud.) The psychiatrist's musings as to whether the young man should be &quot;fixed&quot; and brought into the mainstream but never be able to &quot;run&quot; free again are at the heart of the play; here they just appear trite.Not every great work of art can be translated into another medium.

He must be nuts, the thinking goes, and suitable mental health is sought.Richard Burton's character, Dr. Martin Dysart, doesn't just try to help his severely neutrotic and psychotic patients, he often leads them in a dysfunctional romp through the nethermind and disregards ordinary boundaries.""Why me?"" Dysart asks the referring professional when requested to involve himself with this particularly difficult, horse-maiming patient.  She's already told him once, but he wants to hear it again, maybe in a new way.  The answer is naturally because he's the best.  He doesn't argue.And so Dr. Dysart sluthes his way through the mind of young Alan, through his broken Stepford mum and embarrassed, muttering dad, and through the evidences of a life that not only has taken the road less travelled, but has gone crashing through the underbrush of a dark, sharp wood where no one else goes.When Alan awakens from a nightmare to see Dysart standing above him, he wasn't the only one who wondered, WTF?  In fact, Dysart's apparent conversion from general shrink to field forensic psychiatrist who just happens to be everywhere he needs to be was just a little odd.  His obsession with the Strang case, however, became understandable.Firth was excellent in this, the best part actually.  I was afraid after the introduction that Burton's Dysart would be overwrought, but he settled into it well enough with occasional relapses into overacting.  The complex repressed sexual themes were interesting and this film will probably appeal to fans of Burton and people interested in well-written tales of the mentally ill.

277202,A2NT656K8QYTX3,6301966449,"PDC ""PoeBoy""","[1, 1]","Having seen Anthony Hopkins live in the stunning original John Dexter staging of Peter Shaffer's powerful, mythic psychodrama, I had unfairly high expectations when I originally saw Sidney Lumet's fine though slightly flawed film version.However, on the positive side, I had no complaints whatsoever about the performances, for Harry Andrews, Colin Blakely, Joan Plowright, Jenny Agutter and Eileen Atkins comprised the finest supporting cast one could possibly hope for. And the play's original Allan Strang - Peter Firth - and Broadway's Tony- winning Dr. Martin Dysart - Richard Burton (also Oscar-nominated) - were simply magnificent.My reservations had strictly to do with certain cinematic choices which the very talented and versatile Mr. Lumet made in adapting Shaffer's electrifying play to another medium. For, as originally staged, 'Equus' approached Greek tragedy in its highly stylized and expressionistic staging with the horses played unforgettably by actors clad in dark brown ""track-suits"" and wearing both steel-and-leather horse-masks - like glittering, skeletal sculptures - and iron-and-steel ""hooves"" which gave them intimidating height and an unearthly, graceful, godlike ominousness.Yet, in the film version, the horses are merely...well, horses. And beautiful as they are, and though often stunningly photographed, we still see those sweet, expressive, long-lashed eyes which are hideously put out in the film's blood-drenched climax - a scene which was paradoxically more powerful onstage for being stylized, balletic, and completely bloodless, with the boy MIMING the blinding of the unfortunate animals which in his tortured mind he sees as vengeful, accusing deities. And this approach was also quite sensibly used in the recent Broadway revival starring Daniel Radcliffe and Richard Griffiths. And what was psychologically and emotionally shattering on the stage became gruesome and all but unwatchable in the film.And yet a valid case can also be made for unflinchingly showing Alan's horrific crime for exactly what it is, with no punches (or, in this case, stabs) pulled. But be forewarned.I also found myself wishing the film had been made in black and white and wondering what David Lynch might have done with it, employing the same cinematic vocabulary he employed in his amazing film of 'The Elephant Man'.But all this is idle speculation, for Lumet's film is what it is and contains many wonderful cinematic flourishes of its own, including some infrequent though welcome moments of stylization, and a number of bravura set-pieces. The most memorable of these is Alan's ritualistic, naked midnight ride, shot in one long exhilarating take, which achieves both the requisite mythic power and a raw erotic intensity which not only equals but in some ways surpasses the equivalent sequence in the play. Other standout moments have as much to do with Richard Burton's towering and eloquent performance - fully the equal of Anthony Hopkins' virtuoso stage portrayal - as they do with Lumet's direction. And the sheer poetry of that wonderful Welsh vocal instrument - again, at the very least, the equal of fellow Welshman Hopkins - was music to my ears. But what stays with me most are the extraordinary moments when Burton's Dysart simply stares out with infinite sadness, loss, disillusionment and profound longing at the world he has somehow settled for. This is quite simply one of Burton's finest film performances, on a level with 'Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?' and '1984'.So, on balance, and with my several reservations aside, this is an excellent, beautifully acted film of a thrilling, riveting play and that is reason enough to seek it out.

277203,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6301966449,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 3]","Equus (Sidney Lumet, 1977)I have to admit that at first, I was kind of unimpressed with Equus. Richard Burton narrating the first dream bit... it just didn't work. It seemed overdone, the symbolism was way too naked, this just wasn't Peter Shaffer. No subtlety. No tact. For that matter, come to think of it, this wasn't Sidney Lumet, either. It was about ten minutes later, during the bit where Alan Strang (Peter Firth) is relaying his first experience with a horse, that the movie really fell into place. I think that has a great deal to do with Firth and not nearly as much to do with Burton, though he does grow into his role as the movie progresses. Firth, on the other hand, gives a powerful, terrifying performance from the get-go here. His mentally disturbed Strang is a perfect fit for Shaffer's celebrated meditation on the potential damage of the mixture of sex and religion. And while Equus, thanks in no small part to its slow, unworkable beginning, never quite reaches the heights of Dog Day Afternoon or Twelve Angry Men, but it remains a powerful and disturbing film, once it takes off. And take off it does.The cast entire do a very good job here. Joan Plowright is almost as distressing as Firth, despite being supposedly sane, while Colin Blakely plays her blustering, ineffectual husband excellently. Jenny Agutter (once again fulfilling her role as, in the immortal words of Jeff Murdock, ""an advertisement for nudity!"") makes a perfect love interest for Strang, teasing and coy, but willing to take the upper hand when necessary, while Burton, once he warms to the role, makes a fine psychotherapist. But what sets this apart is Lumet's interesting decision to keep Alan Strang at the same age in his flashbacks, rather than taking the more conventional choice of casting six-year-old and twelve-year-old actors to play earlier versions of the sixteen-year-old Strang; the scene I mentioned earlier, where Strang recounts his first experience with a horse, is just monumental. While it probably would be had they cast another character, by keeping Firth, the scene also gains an unsettling quality of imbalance; you know he's supposed to be six, but there he is, still his adult self. Amazing stuff.The subject matter, in today's political climate in both Britain and America, is probably deeply unpopular; if anything, that's even more a reason to get your hands on a copy of this at your earliest convenience and indulge yourself. ****",4,Once it gets rolling... pow!,1184025600,"07 10, 2007",2007,2460,"['Equus', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', '1977', 'have', 'admit', 'first', 'was', 'kind', 'unimpressed', 'Equus', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'narrating', 'first', 'dream', 'bit', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'seemed', 'overdone', 'symbolism', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'naked', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'Peter', 'Shaffer', 'subtlety', 'tact', 'matter', 'come', 'think', 'was', ""n't"", 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'either', 'was', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'later', 'bit', 'where', 'Alan', 'Strang', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'relaying', 'first', 'experience', 'horse', 'movie', 'really', 'fell', 'place', 'think', 'great', 'deal', 'do', 'Firth', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'Burton', 'grow', 'role', 'movie', 'Firth', 'other', 'hand', 'powerful', 'terrifying', 'performance', 'get-go', 'here', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'Strang', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Shaffer', 'celebrated', 'meditation', 'potential', 'damage', 'mixture', 'sex', 'religion', 'Equus', 'thanks', 'small', 'part', 'slow', 'unworkable', 'beginning', 'never', 'quite', 'heights', 'Dog', 'Day', 'Afternoon', 'Twelve', 'Angry', 'Men', 'powerful', 'disturbing', 'film', 'take', 'off', 'cast', 'entire', 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'almost', 'as', 'distressing', 'Firth', 'being', 'supposedly', 'sane', 'Colin', 'Blakely', 'blustering', 'ineffectual', 'husband', 'excellently', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', 'once', 'again', 'fulfilling', 'role', 'immortal', 'words', 'Jeff', 'Murdock', 'advertisement', 'nudity', 'perfect', 'love', 'interest', 'Strang', 'teasing', 'coy', 'willing', 'take', 'upper', 'hand', 'when', 'necessary', 'Burton', 'once', 'role', 'fine', 'psychotherapist', 'what', 'apart', 'Lumet', 'interesting', 'decision', 'keep', 'Alan', 'Strang', 'same', 'age', 'flashbacks', 'rather', 'taking', 'more', 'conventional', 'choice', 'casting', 'six-year-old', 'twelve-year-old', 'actors', 'play', 'earlier', 'versions', 'sixteen-year-old', 'Strang', 'scene', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'where', 'Strang', 'first', 'experience', 'horse', 'just', 'monumental', 'probably', 'would', 'be', 'had', 'cast', 'character', 'keeping', 'Firth', 'scene', 'also', 'gains', 'unsettling', 'quality', 'imbalance', 'know', 'supposed', 'be', 'six', 'there', 'still', 'adult', 'self', 'Amazing', 'stuff.The', 'subject', 'matter', 'today', 'political', 'climate', 'Britain', 'America', 'probably', 'deeply', 'unpopular', 'anything', 'even', 'more', 'reason', 'get', 'hands', 'copy', 'earliest', 'convenience', 'indulge', '****']",Equus VHS

(I haven't seen it onstage but I have read the play).I'm a big fan of Richard Burton when he's ""there"" for a role.What I mean by that is that Burton sometimes took roles that were so far beneath him for either money or something to do, like THE EXORCIST II or too many others.But EQUUS, like BECKET and WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, really taps into the pain and rage and helplessness that Burton allows to seethe to the surface.Another great performance from him.The second thing I like is the idea behind the story: I see EQUUS as a young man trying to find God--something to believe in--with a father who denies him that freedom.  When the brusque father abruptly rips his son's painting of Jesus down, the son is made to feel that his spiritual side is weak and unacceptable.  Then he replaces God with his private horse god Equus.Burton's beaten, bankrupt doctor recognizes the passion of the boy...and sees the emptiness of his own ""beliefs.""""His stare says, 'At least I galloped, when did you?'""

I am a big movie fan but I wish I could take back watching this crap. Watch it if you think that someone worshipping a horse as God makes a good story?

277208,A355ILYSF7287Z,6301966449,Webster Forrest,"[4, 8]","The script is full of ideas and keeps one awake and thinking, and Richard  Burton's rich development of the character is an intellectual feast. There  are also many ideas which are wonderfully presented and connected with each  other purely through visual storytelling. From that point of view it's a  much better film than I had expected.On the down side, Joan Plowright  is overrated by general standards - perhaps it was a highlight for her, but  in comparison with Burton she is emotionless. Peter Firth's performance is  terribly overrated: his approach to the role is horribly external and  stagey, complete with some stock 'stick-walk' for the mental patient he  portrays, which is just maddening. His most marketable contribution to the  film is visible in the many scnes he performs 'al fresco'.This movie is  definately worth buying - because it deservs repeated viewings. It's a pity  the character of Alan (Peter Firth) isn't better portrayed: he's just by  far too stagey and deliberate. Buy it for the writing, buy it for Burton,  but know it's flawed.",3,"Nice for certain things, but not a complete success",964569600,"07 26, 2000",2000,1066,"['script', 'full', 'ideas', 'one', 'awake', 'thinking', 'Richard', 'Burton', 'rich', 'development', 'character', 'intellectual', 'feast', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'ideas', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'presented', 'connected', 'other', 'purely', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'point', 'view', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'down', 'side', 'Joan', 'Plowright', 'overrated', 'general', 'standards', 'perhaps', 'was', 'highlight', 'comparison', 'Burton', 'emotionless', 'Peter', 'Firth', 'performance', 'terribly', 'overrated', 'approach', 'role', 'horribly', 'external', 'stagey', 'complete', 'stock', 'mental', 'patient', 'just', 'maddening', 'most', 'marketable', 'contribution', 'film', 'visible', 'many', 'scnes', ""fresco'.This"", 'movie', 'definately', 'worth', 'buying', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'pity', 'character', 'Alan', 'Peter', 'Firth', ""n't"", 'better', 'portrayed', 'just', 'far', 'too', 'stagey', 'deliberate', 'Buy', 'writing', 'buy', 'Burton', 'know', 'flawed']",Equus VHS
