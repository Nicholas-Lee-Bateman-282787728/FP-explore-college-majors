427365,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,6304509405,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[9, 9]","I know that alot people probably have seen this and thought it was ridiculous or have seen it on the movie store shelf and ignored it. This is such a funny movie-- Fran Drescher is the main draw, but Timothy Dalton as the angry, dictator/president father of three is hilarious as well. There's one scene where he tells one of his advisors to ""Talk to the hand."" It's funny because it's a rigid Timothy Dalton doing this. And also because NO ONE does this anymore.Drescher stars as Joy Miller, an aspiring beautician. While she's teaching a beauty class, the classroom goes up in flames because a student was smoking and caught the mannequin head on fire. Another student attempts to put the fire out by using a can of hairspray. Oops. Joy saves the animals that are in the classroom and ends up on the front page, and because she's such a dedicated ""teacher,"" is offered a job teaching the children of the Slovetzian president, Pochenko (Dalton). Joy has several meet-cutes with this seemingly cold, brutal president, who acts more like a dictator. We come to find that he's not as rigid as we think.It's Beauty and the Beast meets The King and I. It's not executed as well as the previously mentioned, this movie stutters through their romance (remind me why she instantly likes him so much??) and there's an unnecessary story about a ""rebel"" boyfriend of the president's daughter, which turns into a giant rigamaroll. Though all in all, this movie is a good laugh.

427405,A14OB7YKMPBJLW,6304509405,Susan Fong,"[7, 7]","""The Beautician and the Beast"" is a warm and surprisingly touching romantic comedy/drama.  It's a modern day cinderella story as well as a variation on the age-old ""Beauty and the Beast"" fable.Fran Drescher as Joy Miller is a delight as the beautician from Queens who is stunning to look at but whose voice is a distinctive blend of nasal/New York.  Believing that she is a public school teacher when in fact she is a beauty school teacher, Joy is mistakenly recruited by a representative of the dictator of a small eastern European country as a  teacher for his children.  The dictator is played by Timothy Dalton who somewhat resembles a youthful and very sexy Laurence Olivier.  There is  ferociousness tempered by a childlike vulnerability in Dalton's vigorous performance.Joy may not have a university degree in education, but she has plenty of street smarts.  She has a patient and understanding nature yet doesn't hesitate to speak her mind especially when a wrong is committed. Joy makes an enduring impression upon the dictator's children and especially upon the tyrannical father himself.This movie improves with age because it reminds us that entertainment  does not have to be profanity-laced, violent, or sexually explicit to hold your interest.  Instead, its depiction of people and relationships is gentle and humane.  Additionally, ""The Beautician and the Beast"" is a visual treat with impressive photography, sets, and costumes.  It also has a lush and romantic musical score.Amongst so many unimaginative, big-budget Hollywood movies and their equally unimaginative, big-budget sequels, ""The Beautician and the Beast"" shines like a diamond in the rough.  It's a film that your whole family can watch and feel good about.
