Whether he's thwarting transvestite enenmies as a pet detective or slipping into a mask and into Cameron Diaz's pants, Carrey's got the style, wit, and physical humor one needs to get rich. Which is why Jim surprised us all with this very dark venture into psycology and television, &quot;The Cable Guy&quot;. Sure the film is at times, plain Jim Carrey (overacted melodramatics for laughs), but nside is a wonderful descent into the cable guy's infested mind: his mother's abandonment; his knowledge that &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; always gets the chicks; his memory of all the words to Jefferson Airplane hits; and why he ultamatly befriends and stalks Matthew Broderick. It's also cool to know that Mr. Ben Stiller directed it, who goes on to play a part in a recent dark/humor film, &quot;The Royal Tennenbaums&quot;. And sure, most of the film is an excuse for Carrey to show himself off, and that he does. Credit also goes to Jack Black and Owen Wilson for turning in good performances.&quot;The Cable Guy&quot; is a social commentary flick; it's own self parodying makes evidence of that(Carrey, at the end: &quot;Think about it: this sure is a great place for an ending&quot;).

Even in an episode of ""The Simpsons"", Homer said that this movie nearly ruined Jim Carry's career and then rips the original Cable Guy script.  Even at amazon.com, it you go to the movie ""Liar Liar"", it says that ""Liar Liar"" made up for a disappointing ""Cable Guy"".  But I liked this movie.  Anyway here is how the movie is.Matthew Broderick plays Steven, a man who recently got dumped by his girlfriend, Robin (Leslie Mann) and kicked out of her home but they do not totally hate each other, they are just not a couple.  While Steven is moving in his new place all he wants is just some cable. When the cable guy (Jim Carry) installs his cable Steven becomes his ""Preferred Customer"".  The Cable guy seems to be a little weird.  One he is a huge movie and TV freak about everything that has been shown on TV and is very generous to Steve.  He is so generous that gives Steven free stuff like the cable, cost Steve a dime a dime, and gave him a totally new entertainment center.  Steven's friend, Rick (Jack Black from ""Shallow Hal"") notices that there is something not right about this cable and wants to find out what it is.  Anyway after Seven finds out that the cable guy or ""Chip Douglas"" as he says his name is does something real terrible and horrible to him, Steven wants him to get out his life.  After the cable guy starts tries to make things up , Steven knows he can't have room in his life for another friend and tries to get Chip to understand in a friendly way.  But although Steven didn't mean any harm when he said that, that is when the horror starts.  First Chip gets the police to arrest Steve because that new entertainment center he had seems to be stolen!  And then Chip makes him look stupid in jail, gets him fired from his job, makes him look like an idiot in front of his family, and ruins his relationship with Robin.  What makes this more ironic is that Rick finds out that Chip doesn't even work for the Cable Company and his name isn't even Chip!  Who is this guy?  What does he want? Why is he stalking Steven?As you can see, ""The Cable Guy"" is a very twisted and bizarre movie but hilarious.

164878,A7NBCYVPM10U7,0800141687,Bill Jones,"[6, 7]","Prior to the hugely successful &quot;Liar Liar&quot;, Jim Carrey made the darkly funny &quot;Cable Guy&quot;.  It was a big disappointment at the box office and most critics dismissed it, but I think it's one of Carrey's best  films.Mathew Broderick stars opposite Carrey as Steve.  As the movie  opens Steve's just broken up with his girlfriend and is moving into a new  apartment.Carrey plays the title character, a lisping psycho who worms  his way into Steve's life after installing his cable.  Carrey doesn't have  any friends, just &quot;preferred customers&quot;, and he's soon all over  Steve (who is somewhat vulnerable), terrorizing his friends, and finally  taking over his life.What I like about &quot;Cable Guy&quot; is that,  unlike previous Carrey vehicles, this one has some ideas.  In a flashback  we learn that TV is a poor substitute for loving parents when we see  Carrey's mother trotting off to a bar, leaving the young kid alone with the  television, which mom refers to as the &quot;babysitter&quot;.  There's a  nice little message about the dehumanizing effects of TV and what a friend  of mine calls &quot;second-hand living&quot;.At the same time, the movie  is a comedy and I enjoyed trying to catch all the obscure references  Carrey's constantly making to old TV shows.  In one terrific scene, at a  &quot;Medieval Times&quot; restaurant, the pair play out a battle that  references a specific scene in a &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode, that even  goes so far as to include the same background music.

164879,AB82EKHDKP2H8,0800141687,"""bixman71""","[2, 2]","I am a fan of Jim Carrey and have seen a lot of his movies, including Once Bitten(the first Carrey movie i saw), both Ace Venturas, The Mask, parts of Dumb and Dumber, Liar Liar, Me, Myself & Irene and this. Most people think this is one of Carrey's worst, if not his worst, movies...In this comedy hit, Carrey plays Chip Douglas, a psychotic cable installer who compares everything in his life to televison. His lush mother chose the bar over her son and left him to be raised by TV. As he becomes an adult, TV is all he knows. Among his other flaws, he considers a friend to be someone who spends all their time with one person because it was the way he saw on televison. Matthew Broderick plays alongside comedy legend Carrey as unsuspecting archcitect Steve Kovacs, who has recently broken up with his girlfriend. When Steve calls the cable company to ask about getting his cable hooked up, they are over an hour late. And when the ""Cable Guy""(Carrey) shows up, Steve is taking a shower. Steve says he wants all the movie channels, for which he offers Douglas fifty dollars, which Douglas refuses. Instead, he offers to hook them up for free. As the movie progresses, Steve wishes he had given him the fifty dollars when he had the chance because now he is Chip's and Chip has no intention to let him go. Midway through the movie, Chip takes the attitude of a father who disapproves of something his son does. In other words, if Chip doesn't like it, Steve won't do it. This attitude becomes apparent in a scene when Chip leaves a message on Steve's answering machine to call him when he gets home. When Steve fails to do so, an angry Chip shows up at his apartment asking why he didn't. Late in the movie, Chip believes he will be a better friend to Steve if he can get him back together with his estranged girlfriend. But Chip's idea of doing this is to keep all of Steve's other friends away from him. When Steve tries to put Chip out of his mind, Chip responds by saying he can be Steve's best friend or his worst enemy...This movie is a perrfect example of just how important it is to have better famliy relationships.

Newby ""spikescreed""","[4, 4]","Odds are, if you are contemplating purchasing this movie on Blu-Ray, you probably already like it so I won't bother reviewing the film. Suffice it to say that this is one of my all-time favorite comedies.Because of its rejection by audiences upon its release, this film was never given a proper release on DVD. A bare-bones copy exists and is worth every penny of the $5 you probably spent on it. I was shocked to hear of a Blu-Ray release given its previous reputation as a mediocre comedy by a bunch of people with little experience (and Jim Carrey acting out of character). I never agreed with that reputation and therefore was pleased to see so much effort was being put into this new release.All efforts paid off in a big way. The sound and picture are about as good as its gets in HD. Colors are crisp, contrast is sharp, and every nook and cranny is observable. While that is a draw in itself, the special features are what merit the upgrade from the DVD. Commentary by Judd Apatow, Ben Stiller, and Jim Carrey provides insight into the making of the film and demonstrates how much fun it must have been to work with the three of them together. Their childish banter and constant joking make for a delightful listen, and their reactions to the film are almost as hilarious as the film itself. The best part is that they keep going and going until the movie's end cuts them off. The deleted/extended scenes offer a vision of the film which could have been much darker as well as fills in the gaps left by the theatrical trailer (which featured a lot of cut scenes in it). The gag reel is very funny and shows off Carrey's typical off-screen antics. The behind-the-scenes features offer a chance for fans to witness how the film came together. Coupled with the commentary, a fully developed concept of the movie emerges, one that demonstrates just how ahead of its time this film was.I would recommend that any fan of this film spend the money and upgrade from their DVD copy.

It changed the 2.35:1 aspect ratio down to 4:3 and gave no special features.Finally we get the release that this underrated dark comedy masterpiece deserves, complete with commentary, deleted scenes, gag reel, etc.  Also, the commentary isn't some crappy pre-release commentary that has been sitting in a can for 15 years, it is very recent and interesting because they give some very honest insight into their lives at the time of making the film and they reflect on how poorly the film was received.  Jim Carrey also mentions that this is the first commentary that he has ever done and he, ben stiller, and judd apatow briefly discuss the perks and the price of fame.Hopefully we'll get a good release of Ace Ventura next.",5,THE BLURAY!!!,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,1186,"['was', '10', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'theaters', 'thought', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Apparently', 'others', 'did', 'not', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'least', '10', 'times', 'just', 'like', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'never', 'old', 'consider', 'be', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'best', 'performance', 'given', 'alot', 'consideration..', 'history', 'film', 'interesting', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'originally', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'vehicle', 'instead', 'Jim', 'Carrey', '.The', 'DVD', 'was', 'pathetic', 'changed', '2.35:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'down', '4:3', 'gave', 'special', 'features.Finally', 'get', 'release', 'underrated', 'dark', 'comedy', 'masterpiece', 'deserves', 'complete', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'etc', 'Also', 'commentary', ""n't"", 'crappy', 'pre-release', 'commentary', 'been', 'sitting', 'can', '15', 'years', 'very', 'recent', 'interesting', 'give', 'very', 'honest', 'insight', 'lives', 'time', 'making', 'film', 'reflect', 'how', 'poorly', 'film', 'was', 'received', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'also', 'first', 'commentary', 'ever', 'done', 'stiller', 'judd', 'apatow', 'briefly', 'discuss', 'perks', 'price', 'fame.Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'get', 'good', 'release', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'next']",N/A

This movie was dark and friggin' hilarious.  Jim really gets into his characters and makes them believable.  Matthew Broderick was very good as the sober Steven whose life was turned upside down by this lunatic.  The bathroom beating was my favorite.  Good cameos by Stiller and the then little-known Owen Wilson.  It was topped off by an excellent ending in the helicoptor.

164884,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0800141687,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","(To be read with the pompous tone of James Lipton) Upon initial release, The Cable Guy was met with a barrage of bad reviews. People were expecting the rubber faced whacky comedian of Ace Ventura, Pet Detective, but this was a much darker brew. Much, much darker. Plus, there was a backlash when it was revealed that Carrey was paid twenty million for his role--at the time an unheard of amount. As time wore on it garnered a substantial cult following, and Chip Douglas (if that is his real name, and I'm pretty sure it wasn't, because The Cable Guy acquired all of his aliases from old TV programs, and Chip Douglas was a character on My Three Sons) got the last laugh.The importance of tone in the success or failure of a dramatic work, whether for television, stage, or the silver screen, cannot be over estimated. In a saxophone section the Baritone, Alto, and Tenor Saxes should all have unique sounds, but their tones must also blend. Sometimes one or more players in an ensemble will have a radically different tone that makes them stand out, the classic example being Michael Richards as Cosmo Kramer on Seinfeld--he holds the patent on The Whacky Neighbor archetype. Another example would be Will & Grace with one comic tone while Jack & Karen, somehow still inhabiting the same universe, are using a much broader and even cartoonish tone. Carrey's Cable Guy is way over the top, but he nonetheless manages to maintain his balance on this amazing tight wire act. Notice how his character has a lisp, for instance, and he maintains it throughout. This is very difficult for your average actor, but Carrey carries it off without a hith-th-th.Another important consideration is dynamics. If you start out loud, then you have nowhere to go. From the moment Carrey delivered his first line, ""Caaable Guuuy!"" I was concerned for him. Was he setting a trap for himself? Pace yourself, but brace yourself: Carrey starts at forte and crescendos to fortissississississimo. Matthew Broderick et al are like a comfortable realistic backdrop that sets off the histrionics of Carrey's Cable Guy nicely. Even Jack Black gives a most understated performance as rival best friend Rick. Janeane Garofalo in a small but effective cameo as Medieval Times Waitress also manages to keep her eye rolls in check.-------------Steven: Can I get a knife or fork?Wench: There were no utensils in medieval times, hence there are no utensils AT Medieval Times. Would you like a refill on that Pepsi?Steven: There were no utensils but there was Pepsi?Wench: Dude, I got a lot of tables.======================Garofalo gives just enough attitude to let you know what she thinks of an establishment that doesn't provide utensils (since that wouldn't be in keeping with the Medieval Times theme, yet serves Pepsi) without imperiling her waitress job. Total authenticity. I've seen this waitress in real life many times--in fact she has just this moment served me a doppio espresso at Starbuck's!Yes, The Medieval Times restaurant scene! One of several brilliant, super fantastic scenes in The Cable Guy. Without giving away too much, I must say that during the fight Jim Carrey and Matthew Broderick use weapons similar to those used in the ""Star Trek"" (1966) episode entitled ""Amok Time"". In that episode Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock are forced to battle for the amusement of on looking aliens. What is so fantastically brilliant about this scene in The Cable Guy is that Jim Carrey is so into it that he starts to sing the music, and when the actual music from that episode enters on the sound track he is perfectly in tune--perfectly in sync with it. There is also an earlier reference to The Silence of the Lambs that Jim Carrey totally improvised (cracking up Matthew Broderick) that director Ben Stiller wisely left in the final ""cut."" Andy Dick also has a most amusing cameo as the host of Medieval Times.The Karaoke scene is also a standout:-------------------Chip Douglas: You might recognize this song as performed by Jefferson Airplane, in a little rockumentary called ""Gimme Shelter,"" about the Rolling Stones and their nightmare at Altamont. That night the Oakland chapter of the Hell's Angels had their way. Tonight, it's my turn.===========================And have his way, he does. He launches into a jaw dropping version of Grace Slick's ""Somebody to Love"" that works on so many levels. Of course it expertly skewers the whole Karaoke scene, but it shows also his over-the-top commitment to his performance, and how that zeal translates into troubling stalker tendencies. It shows his vulnerable side as well. It also hammers home the point that tone is paramount, as well as delivers a practical hands-on demonstration in how to achieve that Grace Slick vibrato!The Cable Guy also works on multiple levels. It is a great dark comedy, and also kind of a thrilling thriller. Is it a dramedy or a comma? No, it transcends mere punctuation. There are philosophical questions posed, as well as psychological ones. There is a whole Love/Hate thing with television that pays tribute to the classic TV programs we grew up with, but also asks what kind of effect using TV as a babysitter or a substitute for actual human contact has had. Are we becoming more isolated as our technology improves? Can you keep a best friend on video tape? What Brave New World is this?----------------Chip Douglas: The future is now! Soon every American home will integrate their television, phone and computer. You'll be able to visit the Louvre on one channel, or watch female wrestling on another. You can do your shopping at home, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend from Vietnam. There's no end to the possibilities!========================I emphatically and whole heartedly award The Cable Guy an unequivocal five stars! My highest possible rating.--------Chip Douglas: What a place for an ending, huh?

164897,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0800141687,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 2]","In 1996, Ben Stiller who was known for his TV series ""The Ben Stiller Show"" and the 1994 film ""Reality Bites"" directed a dark comedy starring Matthew Broderick (""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""Glory"", ""Godzilla"") and Jim Carrey (""Ace Ventura"", ""Dumb & Dumber"", ""The Mask"", ""In Living Color"") in the role of the antagonist.  The film would also star Jack Black, Leslie Mann, Janeane Garofalo, Owen Wilson, George Segal and Andy Dick.Despite the split reviews from film critics, ""The Cable Guy"" which was budgeted at $47 million ($20 million went to Jim Carrey alone) would earn over $102 million in the box office.The film revolves around Steven M. Kovacs (played by Matthew Broderick), who had recently moved out of his girlfriend Robin Harris' (played by Leslie Mann) apartment.  On the first day of moving in to his new apartment, he waits for the cable guy to arrive.  His friend Rick (played by Jack Black) tells him that if he slips the cable guy $50, he can get free cable channels.When the cable guy arrives, Steven is shocked about how strange this guy is.  The Cable Guy, Ernie ""Chip"" Douglas (played by Jim Carrey) ends up rearranging Steven's apartment (in order to get the best viewing area) and when he leaves, Steven tries to ask Chip about something he has heard about free cable.  At first, Chip tries to make Steven feel bad for bringing something up illegal but needless to say, Chip likes to have fun with Steven.  And Steven ends up calling Chip a friend.This triggers something within Chip and now as a ""friend"" to Steven, he wants to take him on a trip to see the satellite where cable is beamed from.  At first Steven is reluctant but he goes.  The two hang out and Steven starts to learn some strange details about Chip.The following day, as Steven has a date with Robin and invites her to his home to watch a movie, he sees dozens of messages left by Chip.  Steven ignores it.  While he and Robin try to watch cable, the cable seems to be off.  When he calls Chip to check on it, within seconds, Chip is there and reveals that he turned off Steven's cable because Steven was not a good friend and didn't return his call.  But in order to fix the relationship, Chip tells Steven that he must hang out with him the next night and Steven agrees.Needless to say, things between Steven and Robin are still not good and she wants her space.  To make him happy, Chip takes Steven out to a restaurant known as ""Medieval times"" and the two partake in knight suits and go into battle.  Chip and Steven do battle and Chip seems quite brutal but in the end, Steven wins and their friendship gets stronger (in Chip's mind).The following day, Steven is shocked to find out that Chip had broken into his house and installed a full entertainment system.  Upset that Chip broke into his house, Steven makes it up to him by throwing a karaoke party at his pad and introduces him to a woman named Heather.  Thinking that Heather was a good friend of Chip's, needless to say, Steven and Heather have a good time with each other.  That is until the next morning when Chip reveals that since he treated him and paid for it, he can do the same for him next time.  Shocked, Steven is angered that Chip had hired a prostitute.  Steven then kicks Chip out of his life.Chip wants to make it up to Steven, so Chip feels to get Steven back is by getting Robin back with him.  So, while Robin is on a date with a guy (played by Owen Wilson), when he goes to the restroom, Chip beats him up and threatens him.  When Chip goes to meet with Robin, he convinces her to get back with Steven.But as Steven shows his gratitude towards Chip, Steven feels that Chip is way too strange for him and tells him that he has no room in his life for another friend.And now, Chip starts stalking Steven and Robin until he gets Steven's attention and gets their friendship back, by any means necessary.VIDEO:""The Cable Guy: 15th Anniversary Edition"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  On Blu-ray, the film looks very good.  You can see quite a bit of detail, especially when you see Steven and Chip in their knight outfits, you can see the beads of water from the rain on Chip's leather jacket and the detail of the leather.  You can see the skin pigments on the characters, as well as the rain or grime (towards the end of the film) on the characters.  There was one scene during the deep rain and you see a bit of steam rising and during that moment I saw a bit of banding but for the most part, this film looks very good on Blu-ray.  There is a good amount of grain, blacks are nice and deep (and there are a lot of scenes shot during the dark) and scenes that will occasionally showcase color.But overall, watching this film in HD, I'm confident that the Blu-ray looks much better than its 1997 DVD counterpart.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Cable Guy: 15th Anniversary Edition is presented in English, French 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  For the most part, the film is dialogue and musically driven through the front and center channels.  Dialogue is crystal clear as is the music by John Ottman (""X2', ""Superman Returns"", ""The Usual Suspects"").Where the surround does come into play is more towards the second half of the film, where rain and thunderstorms can be heard through the surround channels.  When Chip is on top of the Satellite tower, you can hear his echoes coming through the surround channels, you can hear the thunder, the helicopter's spinning blades also quite clearly through the surround channels as well.  I didn't notice any LFE but for the most part, the lossless audio was good for this type of film.Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean and Thai.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Cable Guy: 15th Anniversary Edition"" comes with the following special features (presented in standard definition, English stereo and optional Spanish subtitles):** Audio Commentary - A hilarious and informative commentary by Judd Apatow, Jim Carrey and Ben Stiller.* Gag Reel - (6:31) Bloopers during the filming of ""The Cable Guy"".* HBO First Look - (24:14) The original HBO First Look on the making of ""The Cable Guy"".* Deleted/Extended Scenes - (24:03) Featuring nine extended and deleted scenes.* Comedy Central Canned Ham Presents: The Cable Guy - (21:38) Judd Apatow interviews the cast and crew of ""The Cable Guy"".* Rehearsals: (17:14) Rehearsals for the following scenes: Basketball, Medieval Times, Breakfast, Ending Mud Fight, Karaoke Alt. - Bust A Move* Nightmare Camera Test - (1:15) Jim Carrey testing out his nightmare eyes and look on the camera.* Leslie Mann Audition - (3:01) Judd Apatow auditioning Leslie Mann for the role (note: Both would meet for the first time and eventually got married).* ""Leave Me Alone"" Music Video - (4:34) Jerry Cantrell's music video for ""Leave Me Alone"".* Original Theatrical Trailer - (2:28) The original theatrical trailer for ""The Cable Guy"".JUDGMENT CALL:When I first saw this film back in 1996, I was freaked out!It was one thing to get used to Jim Carrey on ""In Living Color"", ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Mask"" but his character role of the Cable Guy was just too bizarre and disturbing. And it didn't help matters much as I knew someone that had similar qualities to Chip, that freaked me out even more.But as far as black comedies go, typically I'm all for it, but somehow, ""The Cable Guy"" was frightening and one can only imagine the possibilities if this film was made into a horror/thriller film.  Jim Carrey knows how to play creepy guys and in the case of ""Chip"", possibly one of the most disturbing characters to watch in a comedy.But here we are 15 years later with the release of ""The Cable Guy: 15th Anniversary Edition"" and as I was in 1996, here we are in 2011 and I still find the film hilarious and Carrey's character more disturbing as ever.But watching it again, I think there was a time when Carrey used to be too obnoxious and overplayed his characters.  While ""The Mask"" was tolerable, I felt that his version of Riddler in ""Batman Forever"", the Grinch in ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and Lloyd Christmas in ""Dumb & Dumber"" were too over-the-top.  As the Cable Guy, it was too obnoxious and too creepy and for some, I guess the fact that he was quite audacious does help for the role.  I felt that the character of Steven must have been too sympathetic because there are constant red flags all over the place when he first met Chip.  What could have been a hilarious comedy becomes too dark to the point that I felt uncomfortable watching this film.If ""The Cable Guy"" was a horror film, I would have felt that Chip would be much more creepier than Jason and Freddie, because we know that disturbing individuals like Chip do exist.  Could you imagine if ""The Cable Guy"" became the bromance version of ""Fatal Attraction""?If there was a benefit to this film and for its talent, everyone went on to bigger things.  May it be Ben Stiller, Matthew Broderick, Jim Carrey, Jack Black, Owen Wilson and even producer Judd Apatow, not too say that the ""Cable Guy"" launched their careers but it sure did showcase their potential of going on to do bigger projects, especially for Jack Black and Owen Wilson.As for the Blu-ray release of ""The Cable Guy"", the 15th Anniversary has over 50-minutes of never-before-seen extras.  The picture and audio quality is the strong points of this 15th Anniversary Edition release, while the special features does show its age, it would have been nice to have an interview with Stiller, Apatow or some of the cast members 15 years later or something shot recently to celebrate the film's 15th year anniversary.Overall, ""The Cable Guy"" is one of those films that you will either enjoy or dislike, similar to the 50/50 split from the film critics and it has been the case for many Judd Apatow and Ben Stiller films, it all comes down to whether you enjoy black comedy.  For me, I loved the first half of the film, I loved the humor, especially when Chip mimics ""The Silence of the Lambs"" to even the most crazy scene when he meets Steven in jail.  But the enjoyable comedy side of ""The Cable Guy"" tends to get left behind in the first half as the film starts to delve to focusing on Chip as we see a much more of a pest than ever.Once again, if it's a good thing or bad thing is up to the viewer but for me, the film had its share of audaciously funny moments but Carrey's character became more psychopathic, more disturbing as the film progressed.If you are a big fan of ""The Cable Guy"", then the 15th Anniversary Edition on Blu-ray is for you!",4,Blu-ray: 15 years later and this film still creeps me out!,1300233600,"03 16,

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[0, 0]","THE CABLE GUY is as dark as deep space and creepier than walking into a nest of fiddlebacks; Jim Carrey's eerie portrayal of an off-center cable technician--complete with thick lisp and impish grin, mind you--who inexplicably attaches himself to one of his customers tweaks the ""ick"" factor in spades.  This movie has a decided edge--a quirky, satirical spoof of our TV-addicted culture (even before the onslaught of reality TV), but it's also funny.  Outrageously funny.  Carrey's cable guy--who uses aliases of characters from former TV shows--is hysterically funny, and he's augmented by sidekick Matthew Broderick, playing the overwhelmed recipient of the cable guy's intentions.  Broderick is golden himself, as he's lavished with all this sudden attention until his life begins to unravel before his eyes.  Naturally the plot is going to rush headlong towards a creepy, dark, over-the-top ending (which it does), yet Carrey's character is given one last comedic gem as he's being treated by an unsuspecting emergency technician.Rinse, repeat, use again.From dueling one another to the delight of a medieval restaurant crowd, to playing a very adult word game, Carrey and Broderick aptly carry the freight.  Other cast members include Leslie Mann playing Broderick's lukewarm love interest, Owen Wilson as a soon-to-be-dispatched date candidate, and crafty veteran George Segal as Broderick's father.  It's very surprising to see a young Jack Black in a straight man role as Broderick's concerned best friend, and director Ben Stiller gets in on the fun making a cameo as a former child star on trial for murdering his twin brother--a trial sensationalized on every cable channel.  Yes, THE CABLE GUY is disturbing and creepy, but if you like occasional comedies that venture over to the dark side, this film is a must-see.--D.

However, I felt like this was one of the funniest movies in a long time and still consider it hilarious. Jim Carey plays Chip Douglas, an unstable man that has been raised on television and currently works for a cable company. The dialogue and contrasting styles of Jim Carey and Matthew Broderick are great. Broderick wants to find love and success in his work, but finds that Carey wants to be buddies with him following a routine cable service.What makes this movie a winner in my mind is that it is a dark comedy aimed at showing how much television exploits the average American person's mind. Some of the funniest scenes are of Ben Stiller and his court case that appear on television, and the depiction of the average person's craving to follow a murder case. It is disturbing at times, but this is not a movie that takes itself too seriously.Finally, Carey plays his role as a cable guy to perfection, and some of the funniest parts of the movie are just his zany antics. For instance, he takes Broderick to see Medievel Times (it is obvious that Carey has been there many times) and they wind up having their names chosen as the two to perform a jousting competition to the many in attendance.

164908,A19JYLHD94K94D,0800141687,Itamar Katz,"[5, 6]","The Cable Guy is a better film than it pretends to be. It's important to remember that it was made before Carrey began to show its dramatic side in excellent films like The Truman Show, Man On The Moon and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. The Cable Guy was thrown into the pile of low-brow oddball comedies he was famous for like Ace Ventura and Dumb & Dumber. As such, it just wasn't funny enough; and it was way too dark to appeal to Carrey's young and comedy loving films. I can certainly say that at the age of 12, it sure didn't appeal to me. That's because The Cable Guy's biggest problem is that it's not quite sure what kind of film it's supposed to be; it wobbles from oddball comedy to psychological thriller, never really achieving focus in any one genre, never really being realized enough to be able to consider it a genre-transcending, solitary creation.Still - The Cable Guy has its many merits, and it's an interesting enough creation to be worth the watch. And it's certainly not a comedy for kids. In fact it's a much more intelligent film, one that deals with the destructive effect television may or may not have had on many of the post-TV era children, but more importantly than that it deals with loneliness, insanity and exploitation. And Carrey's performance - laden though it is with his trademark physical humor, perfectly fit for the role - is good and dark enough to hit that. The Cable Guy is one of Carrey's most fascinating characters, and he's as dark and distressed as he is pathetic and laughable; the entire film in fact is much darker and more disturbing as may be apparent in first sight. A supporting cast filled with familiar comedians and frat-packers - Jack Black, Owen Wilson, George Segal, Andy Dick, Jeneane Garofalo, David Cross - doesn't help in detaching the film from its crippling `comedy' label. Still, they all get the job done; in fact, Mathew Broderick, who plays straight man for Carrey, is probably the most forgettable actor in the film - which is probably for the best, because he plays the ultimate everyman loser, and he too does what he has to do.It only occurred to me after re-watching it that The Cable Guy has very much in common with a more recent film that also deals with maddening loneliness and longing for human companionship - One Hour Photo starring Robin Williams. Like that film, The Cable Guy never really reaches the full of its potential, and has a story that's unbalanced and unstructured, and so remains an unsatisfying experience; but like One Hour Photo, The Cable Guy has a stellar enough lead performance and enough good points to be worth the watch. In fact, it's much easier to appreciate it now with a decade's hindsight, now that we've seen a lot more range from Jim Carrey. The film certainly has its moments of brilliance; the Sam Sweet side-plot (with a good and minor cameo from director Ben Stiller) and its conclusion is a wonderful touch, that compliments the ending and its point, and Jim Carrey's karaoke scene - beyond the obvious chuckles you may get from his lisping and catatonic singing - is also a disturbing one, and one shouldn't overlook the choice of a song (Jefferson Airplane's `Somebody To Love'). The Cable Guy is not as good as it might have been but it's a daring creation, certainly the most daring one for Stiller as a director. Not exactly one for the ages but a unique and interesting film that's worth the watch.",4,Someone has to kill the babysitter,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,3435,"['Cable', 'Guy', 'better', 'film', 'be', 'important', 'remember', 'was', 'made', 'Carrey', 'began', 'show', 'dramatic', 'side', 'excellent', 'films', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Man', 'Moon', 'Eternal', 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'was', 'thrown', 'pile', 'low-brow', 'oddball', 'comedies', 'was', 'famous', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'such', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'enough', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'dark', 'appeal', 'Carrey', 'young', 'comedy', 'loving', 'films', 'can', 'certainly', 'say', 'age', '12', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'appeal', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'biggest', 'problem', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'kind', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'oddball', 'comedy', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'never', 'really', 'achieving', 'focus', 'one', 'genre', 'never', 'really', 'being', 'realized', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'consider', 'genre-transcending', 'solitary', 'creation.Still', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'many', 'merits', 'interesting', 'enough', 'creation', 'be', 'watch', 'certainly', 'not', 'comedy', 'kids', 'fact', 'much', 'more', 'intelligent', 'film', 'one', 'destructive', 'effect', 'television', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'many', 'post-TV', 'era', 'children', 'more', 'importantly', 'loneliness', 'insanity', 'exploitation', 'Carrey', 'performance', 'laden', 'trademark', 'physical', 'humor', 'perfectly', 'fit', 'role', 'good', 'dark', 'enough', 'hit', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'one', 'Carrey', 'most', 'fascinating', 'characters', 'dark', 'distressed', 'pathetic', 'laughable', 'entire', 'film', 'fact', 'much', 'darker', 'more', 'disturbing', 'may', 'be', 'apparent', 'first', 'sight', 'supporting', 'cast', 'filled', 'familiar', 'comedians', 'frat-packers', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'George', 'Segal', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'Jeneane', 'Garofalo', 'David', 'Cross', ""n't"", 'help', 'detaching', 'film', 'crippling', 'comedy', 'label', 'Still', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'fact', 'Mathew', 'Broderick', 'who', 'straight', 'man', 'Carrey', 'probably', 'most', 'forgettable', 'actor', 'film', 'probably', 'best', 'ultimate', 'everyman', 'loser', 'too', 'what', 'do.It', 'only', 'occurred', 're-watching', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'very', 'much', 'common', 'more', 'recent', 'film', 'also', 'maddening', 'loneliness', 'longing', 'human', 'companionship', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'starring', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'film', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'never', 'really', 'full', 'potential', 'story', 'unbalanced', 'unstructured', 'so', 'unsatisfying', 'experience', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'stellar', 'enough', 'lead', 'performance', 'enough', 'good', 'points', 'be', 'watch', 'fact', 'much', 'easier', 'appreciate', 'now', 'decade', 'hindsight', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'more', 'range', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'film', 'certainly', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'Sam', 'Sweet', 'side-plot', 'good', 'minor', 'cameo', 'director', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'conclusion', 'wonderful', 'touch', 'ending', 'point', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'karaoke', 'scene', 'obvious', 'chuckles', 'may', 'get', 'lisping', 'catatonic', 'singing', 'also', 'disturbing', 'one', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'choice', 'song', 'Jefferson', 'Airplane', 'Somebody', 'Love', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'daring', 'creation', 'certainly', 'most', 'daring', 'one', 'Stiller', 'director', 'Not', 'exactly', 'one', 'ages', 'unique', 'interesting', 'film', 'watch']",N/A

I had heard so many mixed reviews about it, I was sure I wouldn't like it, yet I saw this last night and really loved it.As a fan of Jim Carey, it was a refreshing change to see him play a darker character (while still being comedic).  Mathew Broderick who is always fantastic in anything he does, plays Steven Kovacs who is waiting for the cable guy to come and install cable to his new pad.  Jim plays said cable guy and his power over people is that he gives them free cable.  He does this for Steven and so makes him become his friend.I found the ending sad (not as in crying sad) as Jims character explains why he's the way he is.  This really is a great movie (look out for the always together duo of Stiller and Wilson, George Segal, Eric Roberts, Andy Dick and Jack Black to name a few).

So why do so many people slate this movie? We currently sell it at work, and I've gone to buy it a couple of times, only to be put off by someone telling me ""it's not the Jim Carrey we know & love"". HOW exactly? Is he not funny? Is he not as rubber faced as ever? Sure a couple of his more recent movies haven't got good reviews, but who's to say you won't like them as soon as you soon see them? Personally, Liar Liar & Bruce Almighty will always be my favourites. Liar Liar is hilarious.What will happen if you slip the cable guy $50? You'll get all the film channels (including the dirty ones) for free. And if you're unlucky, you'll also get a new friend. Enter the very lonely, eccentric, Jim Carrey as a loveable cable guy, who speaks with a lisp, and is desperate for a friend. He latches onto Matthew Broderick when he mistakenly asks him his name. He then discovers that Jim's character (does he ever give his REAL name? There's Chip, there's Larry - lets call him Chip) will not leave him alone. They're now friends for life.Friends for life can mean different things. It can mean supporting someone through the good times & the bad. But it can also mean phoning someone 11 times and leaving 11 messages on their machine; cutting off their cable cos they won't answer their phone; landing them in jail and being irritating. Jim does this role to perfection, pulling the funniest faces which you just can't help but smile at, playing basketball (which he can't actually PLAY!), and ab-libbing. One of the latter's examples is during the scene at Medieval Times (look out for Janeane Garofalo!) where Chip asks for Steven's (Matthew Broderick) chicken skin and then performs his Silence of the Lambs impression was all improvised. During one take, Jim asked for the chicken skin out of nowhere. After doing the ""Silence of the Lambs"" bit, director Ben Stiller loved it and wanted to keep it in the film even though it wasn't in the script. If you look at Matthew's face during this scene, you can tell he is cracking up. His reaction is a genuine laugh.I had no idea before watching this film that Ben Stiller was a director first, before he became an actor and churned out a million movies a year. (Even if he does include himself in this film - see if you can spot him.) Look out for Owen Wilson too, who stars as an arrogant jerk who gets him comeuppance.The movie is very funny, but the most memorable scene is Jim's outrageous performance of ""Don't You Want Somebody to Love"". You'll never hear this song again, without seeing his outrageous, OTT performance. It will definitely put a smile on your face.For many people, you're either gonna love or hate this movie.

I saw this film twice  in theaters and before DVD came out, bought the laserdisc to view it in the  original Widescreen 2:35.1 aspect ratio.  Perhaps it was too creepy for the  masses, but I saw it as a very surreal look into living life through your  TV.  I really felt for this guy.  The fact that he didn't have a father and  his mother was basically a lush, affected his social skills to the point of  becoming TV cliche's and losing his true identity in the process.  I don't  think he even knew his real name to tell you the truth.  People keep  criticizing the beating in the bathroom.  I just don't get why.  It's easy  to understand why he did it.  To him, Steve is his best friend and he wants  to help him out.  He knows Steve wants Robin, so what does he do?  In his  own psychotic way, he's making sure no one tries to steal her away from  Steven, thereby making sure she comes back to him and in that thinking, he  figures Steve will want to be his friend even more.  It's crazy, I know,  but, then again, so is the character, and that's why it works.  I mean,  he's following Steven around (stalking).  The basketball court scene, for  instance (you didn't actually believe he comes there all the time did you?)  is the perfect example.  Just how long was he stalking him before he  followed him there?  This is a guy desperate for human contact because, in  the end, people need people.  I really understood that about this film,  especially when Steven says to him, &quot;Everybody gets lonely&quot; and  he replies, &quot;Yeah, but I get really lonely,&quot; and presumedly jumps  to his death onto the huge satellite dish.  It's dark humor at it's finest  because it really grabs you, makes you laugh and then lets you really think  hard about what our society is based on as far as values and tolerable  living conditions.  Take another look, it's there.  But the DVD is lacking  in Special Features.  I mean, for crying out loud, with all the Special  Edition's being released (Feeling Minnesota? ) you'd think  Columbia/TriStar could find the time to release one of The Cable Guy.  I  could sure go for a nice audio commentary with Jim Carrey and Ben Stiller.  And how 'bout deleted scenes and outakes (there must be tons of em) music  videos (Hey Man, Nice Shot by Filter (basketball scene)) and a making of  featurette.  Basically everything you get on the Collector's Edition of  Liar Liar (by Universal Pictures).  Let me also add that it's the only Jim  Carrey movie they own.  So let's get it out there.  And  remember....&quot;The name is Spock.  If we do not fight to the death, they  will kill us both.

A very dark comedy not too different from Steve Martin's earlier film, 'The Lonely Guy' with perhaps a little more erotic innuendo.  A film enjoyed probably by those who really have an appreciation for satire and dark humor.Carrey plays a lonely cable guy who has no life outside of his routine job.  After installing cable for a man who just broke up with his girlfriend (Matthew Broderick), he becomes obessessed in having him as a friend at any cost.  Broderick's character is clearly weary of the cable weirdo but at first tries to be polite, almost pitying him for having such a pathetic existence.  Things start getting too close for comfort until Carey's character goes completely mad.  One of the best scenes is when they're fighting a duel in a medieval show circus and Carrey is madly singing the fighting music from the original Star Trek series; analogizing their duel to one between Spock and Kirk where they'rer fighting with fancy pike-axes.

164930,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0800141687,Reviewer,"[27, 33]","Jim Carrey is ""The Cable Guy"" in this dark comedy from director Ben Stiller.  In one of his best (and underrated) performances, Carrey stars as a lonely, pathetic and very disturbed individual desperately in need of  friendship and some very serious psychiatric care.  Neglected by his mother  as a child, and left in the care of the ""babysitter"" (the television) for  nurturing, he has grown into adulthood as a man orbiting somewhere along  the fringes of reality.  Even his name is an enigma; using various aliases  from the sitcoms he grew up with, he is ""Chip Douglas"" (My Three Sons) when  he happens into the life of the unsuspecting Steven Kovacs (Matthew  Broderick).  Steven is coping with problems of his own; when he  proposes to his girlfriend, Robin (Leslie Mann), she responds by kicking  him out of their apartment.  Steven rents a new place and, of course, has  to get the cable hooked up.  Enter the Cable Guy.  Acting on the advice of  his friend, Rick (Jack Black), Steven approaches Chip with the idea of  setting him up with free movie channels for a fifty dollar gratuity.  ""Ever  hear of anything like that?"" he inquires.  Chip responds with a feigned  admonition about ""Illegal cable,"" then readily agrees to ""Juice him up.""  Unwittingly, Steven thereby forms a bond with Chip, who he later learns can  be ""His best friend, or his worst enemy.""  For comedy to work, it  must be taken seriously; real laughs come from playing it straight, and  Stiller is a master of this technic (As both actor and director).  He is to  be commended here for extracting a tempered performance from Carrey by  reining in his natural tendency toward over exuberance (which has worked  for him in other projects, but would have been detrimental here).  There  are some hilarious moments in this film:  Chip throwing a Karaoke party for  Steven; a scene that takes place at a Medieval Times restaurant (with a  terrific cameo by Janeane Garofalo as their waitress); and a bit with  ongoing news coverage of a murder trial in which Stiller plays twin  brothers Stan and Sam Sweet.  But there are just as many uncomfortable  moments, which tend to leave the viewer somewhat uneasy, such as the scene  in which Chip dupes Steven's family into playing ""Porno Password.""  We feel  Steven's discomfort as well as his frustration with his own inability to  control what ultimately becomes an ugly situation.  Or when Chip confronts  Robin's date (Owen Wilson) in the restroom of a restaurant.  There is an  edgy humor to these scenes, but the underlying hostility has an unnerving  effect.  With a supporting cast that includes George Segal and Diane  Baker (as Steven's parents), Andy Dick (as the Medieval Host), and Eric  Roberts (as himself), ""The Cable Guy"" is a tense and entertaining film.  Some Jim Carrey fans may be a bit put off by this one, though, for it is  not the typical Carrey offering.  This is a glimpse at the effects of a  deranged mind.  It is a dark and somewhat disturbing movie, and in the end,  issues are left unresolved; but addressing Chip's psychoses was never  intended here.  This film was made, not to enlighten, but to entertain; and  in that, it succeeds.  If it is just laughs and light fare you're looking  for, however, be advised:  this is definitely not where you want to go.",3,Let Carrey &quot;Juice you up...&quot;,956275200,"04 21, 2000",2000,3313,"['Jim', 'Carrey', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'dark', 'comedy', 'director', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'one', 'best', 'underrated', 'performances', 'Carrey', 'lonely', 'pathetic', 'very', 'disturbed', 'individual', 'desperately', 'need', 'friendship', 'very', 'serious', 'psychiatric', 'care', 'Neglected', 'mother', 'child', 'left', 'care', 'babysitter', 'television', 'nurturing', 'grown', 'adulthood', 'man', 'orbiting', 'somewhere', 'fringes', 'reality', 'Even', 'name', 'enigma', 'using', 'various', 'aliases', 'sitcoms', 'grew', 'up', 'Chip', 'Douglas', 'Three', 'Sons', 'when', 'life', 'unsuspecting', 'Steven', 'Kovacs', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Steven', 'coping', 'problems', 'own', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'Robin', 'Leslie', 'Mann', 'kicking', 'apartment', 'Steven', 'new', 'place', 'course', 'get', 'cable', 'hooked', 'up', 'Enter', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'Acting', 'advice', 'friend', 'Rick', 'Jack', 'Black', 'Steven', 'Chip', 'idea', 'setting', 'up', 'free', 'movie', 'channels', 'fifty', 'dollar', 'gratuity', 'Ever', 'hear', 'anything', 'Chip', 'feigned', 'admonition', 'Illegal', 'cable', 'then', 'readily', 'Juice', 'up', 'Unwittingly', 'Steven', 'thereby', 'bond', 'Chip', 'who', 'later', 'can', 'be', 'best', 'friend', 'worst', 'enemy', 'comedy', 'work', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'real', 'come', 'playing', 'straight', 'Stiller', 'master', 'technic', 'actor', 'director', 'be', 'commended', 'here', 'extracting', 'tempered', 'performance', 'Carrey', 'reining', 'natural', 'tendency', 'exuberance', 'worked', 'other', 'projects', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'detrimental', 'here', 'are', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'film', 'Chip', 'throwing', 'Karaoke', 'party', 'Steven', 'scene', 'place', 'Medieval', 'Times', 'restaurant', 'terrific', 'cameo', 'Janeane', 'Garofalo', 'waitress', 'bit', 'ongoing', 'news', 'coverage', 'murder', 'trial', 'Stiller', 'twin', 'brothers', 'Stan', 'Sam', 'Sweet', 'are', 'just', 'many', 'uncomfortable', 'moments', 'tend', 'leave', 'viewer', 'somewhat', 'uneasy', 'such', 'scene', 'Chip', 'Steven', 'family', 'playing', 'Porno', 'Password', 'feel', 'Steven', 'discomfort', 'as', 'well', 'frustration', 'own', 'inability', 'control', 'what', 'ultimately', 'ugly', 'situation', 'when', 'Chip', 'confronts', 'Robin', 'date', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'restroom', 'restaurant', 'edgy', 'humor', 'scenes', 'underlying', 'hostility', 'unnerving', 'effect', 'supporting', 'cast', 'George', 'Segal', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'Steven', 'parents', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'Medieval', 'Host', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'tense', 'entertaining', 'film', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'put', 'off', 'one', 'though', 'not', 'typical', 'Carrey', 'offering', 'glimpse', 'effects', 'deranged', 'mind', 'dark', 'somewhat', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'end', 'issues', 'are', 'left', 'unresolved', 'addressing', 'Chip', 'psychoses', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'here', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'not', 'enlighten', 'entertain', 'just', 'laughs', 'light', 'fare', ""'re"", 'looking', 'however', 'be', 'advised', 'definitely', 'not', 'where', 'want', 'go']",N/A

He would leave paper notes on my door saying ""why have you not answered your phone? What happened to you?"" I bought a caller ID unit just to avoid him! He would call from other places like pay phones to try to get me on the phone. It was always ""Hey, if you are not busy let's go do something"" and if I said no he got mad and said ""Why not? What are you going to do, just stay home and do nothing?"".Needless to say, I had to end contact with this person completely. A little socialization just led up to this person wanting to hang out constantly. One time he came over and wanted me to see a movie and I politely refused. He got pissed off like a 2-year-old child and slammed the door on his way out.Carrey's character in this movie is so eerily similar to this former friend of mine that I just have to laugh every time!

The critics didn't like it, though, and there's a reason why. It's because Jim was paid 20 million dollars to play this part, and it's not a very good reason, at that. If Jim hadn't been the first person to earn so much for one movie, somebody else would have come along. Probably that jackal Adam Sandler. Besides, that's chicken feed compared to what some actors make today.Carrey plays a slightly deranged, extremely perverted cable television installer, who becomes obsessed with his clients. One in particular, a bachelor (Matthew Broderick), gets pushed to the edge of his own sanity when The Cable Guy won't leave him alone. The film's comedy gets darker, and more sinister throughout as we see Carrey's slow but sure spiral into madness.This is an exceptional parody of stalker films in general, in the twisted traditions of such films as Psycho, Cape Fear, Fatal Attraction, and Play Misty For Me. Here we see a different side of Jim Carrey. Those who crave a break from such obnoxious, over-the-top characters as Lloyd Christmas, and Ace Ventura should pop in The Cable Guy. Trust me!

164949,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,0800141687,Wheelchair Assassin,"[28, 30]","""The Cable Guy,"" as most know by now, was a major departure for Jim Carrey.  The rubber-faced goofball of hits like ""Dumb And Dumber"" and ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" was still present, but he was appearing in a radically different form.  With Carrey playing a cable installer fixated on an unsuspecting customer, ""The Cable Guy"" is easily his darkest movie.  However, I've got a soft spot for a good black comedy, and this one is about as black (and as good) as they come.Although goofy behavior had been Carrey's trademark since his ""In Living Color"" days (remember Fire Marshal Bill?), ""The Cable Guy"" was the first movie in which his madcap antics hinted at something dark beneath the surface.  Indeed, by playing such a twisted character, Carrey was finally able to let loose and reveal the full range of his comedic gifts (aren't bad guys always more fun?).  In contrast to the likes of ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Dumb And Dumber,"" which were basically just live-action cartoons (albeit amusing ones), ""The Cable Guy"" provides Carrey with a creepy, unsettling vehicle where he gets to show some real malevolence.  When Carrey plays basketball prison-style while Filter's ""Hey Man Nice Shot"" plays in the background, it's both hilarious and disturbing at the same time.  And even when Carrey hams it up, as when he does a vibrato-heavy rendition of Jefferson Airplane's ""Somebody To Love"" while a group of freaky friends dances around him, there's an undercurrent of the surreal.In an equally dramatic departure from Carrey's norm, ""The Cable Guy"" even had a message mixed in with all its weirdness.  It turns out Carrey's nameless cable installer, who gets his pseudonyms from old TV shows, was left by his mother to be raised by the TV, and has attachment issues stemming from his inability to relate to others.  The plot is set against the backdrop of a former child star's trial for killing his twin brother, and director Ben Stiller (who also plays the murderous brother) takes several opportunities for  pointed satire of our TV-addled culture.  It's not until the end that the subject is addressed at length, but the pernicious effects of TV are a prominent theme of the movie.  When the cable guy laments in his closing monologue that he learned about the facts of life from watching ""The Facts Of Life,"" it's strangely poignant.And how about a hand for Matthew Broderick as Steven Kovacs, the unfortunate object of Carrey's fixation?  It's hard to believe this guy almost faded into obscurity in the five years or so after ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off.""  If not for his classic turn in ""Election,"" I'd say Steven was the role Broderick was born to play.  At first Steven just regards the cable guy as a nuisance, but his annoyance over his new friend's increasingly creepy behavior grows as the film wears on until it turns to outright fear and desperation, and Broderick captures it perfectly.  Few, if any actors, make a better hapless guy than Broderick, which is especially ironic given that he became a star playing the uber-cool Ferris Bueller.Watching this movie, it's hard to believe it was such a letdown at the box office.  I firmly believe entertainers should be rewarded for taking risks, but apparently Carrey's fans weren't quite ready for him to play such a troubled character in such a dark movie.  That's too bad, because those who haven't seen this movie are really missing out.

Every actor delivers in this film, and the darkness in the comedy is amazing.Jim Carrey and Matthew Broderick make an amazing duo. I've never understood why this movie got passed over by so many people. I think because at the time Jim Carrey was the guy everyone wanted to be their buddy, and suddenly he came out as the bad guy and was brilliant at it, but no one wanted to see him that way.The jabs this movie takes at our society as a whole and the way we are with television are also blatant and brilliant. The ending is quite obvious, but that's the whole point.Plus, it has both Jack Black and Kyle Gass from Tenacious D, both David Cross and Bob Odenkirk from Mr. Show, Andy Dick, Janine Garafolo, and Ben Stiller as killer twins that everyone's obsessed with on the news.Jim Carrey brings so much deep-down pain to his character and so much energy to the screen.
