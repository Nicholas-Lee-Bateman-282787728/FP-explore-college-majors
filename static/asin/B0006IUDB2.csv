869484,A32GCOTGFJ9XC3,B0006IUDB2,"Alex Honda ""onyx575""","[13, 13]","This is a great behind-the-scenes look at one of the biggest musical events of the twentieth century.The documentary WE ARE THE WORLD: THE STORY BEHIND THE SONG (on dvd #1) is narrated and hosted by Jane Fonda and appears to have been made shortly after the historic recording session, which happened on January 28, 1985. Showing the celebrities arriving, meeting and greeting, and of course the recording of the song ""We Are The World,"" as well as  pre-writing and arrangement stages that took place days before(between Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie and Quincy Jones), viewers get a fly-on-the-wall experience of what went on that night.It really is remarkable to see so many artist from different generations and musical styles combining forces for a greater cause. Where else would you see Bob Dylan, Diana Ross, Kenny Rogers, The Pointer Sisters, Paul Simon, Tina Turner, and Ray Charles, among many others, singing together on one song? The documentary shows the actual breakdown of the recording of the chorus parts, the solos and the very short rehearsal sessions that took place that one night. The recording was done in three parts: the chorus, the line of solo artists that we see in the video, and additional solos by artists that were included after.  The actual edited music video is also included.On dvd #2 there is a ten-year anniversary documentary/interview with Harry Belafonte and this is curious to watch. As another reviewer pointed out, during this documentary Belafonte continues to point out how he got the idea and wanted to do something about the famine plaguing Ethiopia etc., but never once does he mention Bob Geldof. For those of you who remember that time, it was Bob Geldof (BOOMTOWN RATS) and Midge Ure(ULTRA-VOX) who started this whole thing with the song ""Do They Know It's Christmas"" that had many British singers/musicians(as well as American artists Jody Watley and Kool & the Gang and Irish band U2) contributing their talents and collaborating on that single. The British/Irish/American supergroup was called ""BAND AID"" and was created to help with relief aid to those starving in Ethiopia. The single ""DO THEY KNOW..."" was released in December 1984 and went to number one almost a month and a half before WE ARE THE WORLD was recorded.It really has nothing to do with the enjoyment of watching these documentaries or saying which was better BAND AID or USA FOR AFRICA...and really small potatoes in the grand scheme of things...it's just a little troubling to see someone taking credit for a historic event without even mentioning Geldof or Band Aid (who historically were the pre-cursors to ""We Are The World""). The documentary also includes the problems that happened with logistics and controversy of why some of the aid money never reached its destination that surrounded USA FOR AFRICA and talks about HANDS ACROSS AMERICA.Additional footage is also included on dvd #2 including a live 1986 ""American Music Awards"" performance of WE ARE THE WORLD; Belafonte, Jackson, Richie and Jones accepting various awards for the song; and the ""Live Aid"" concert performance of that song. Also included is a booklet that gives an hour-by-hour play-by-play description of the recording session, which is a reprint of a 1985 LIFE magazine cover story.Unless you actually remember this moment in time, or perhaps a huge fan of one of the artists who appear on WATW, this might not be enjoyable to watch.",4,Great Behind-The-Scenes...,1179100800,"05 14, 2007",2007,3435,"['great', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'one', 'biggest', 'musical', 'events', 'twentieth', 'century.The', 'documentary', 'WE', 'ARE', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'STORY', 'BEHIND', 'THE', 'SONG', 'dvd', '1', 'narrated', 'hosted', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'shortly', 'historic', 'recording', 'session', 'happened', 'January', '28', '1985', 'Showing', 'celebrities', 'arriving', 'meeting', 'greeting', 'course', 'recording', 'song', 'Are', 'World', 'as', 'well', 'pre-writing', 'arrangement', 'stages', 'took', 'place', 'days', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Lionel', 'Richie', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'viewers', 'get', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'experience', 'what', 'went', 'night.It', 'really', 'remarkable', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'artist', 'different', 'generations', 'musical', 'styles', 'combining', 'forces', 'greater', 'cause', 'Where', 'else', 'would', 'see', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'Pointer', 'Sisters', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'many', 'others', 'singing', 'together', 'one', 'song', 'documentary', 'actual', 'breakdown', 'recording', 'chorus', 'parts', 'solos', 'very', 'short', 'rehearsal', 'sessions', 'took', 'place', 'one', 'night', 'recording', 'was', 'done', 'three', 'parts', 'chorus', 'line', 'solo', 'artists', 'see', 'video', 'additional', 'solos', 'artists', 'were', 'included', 'actual', 'edited', 'music', 'video', 'also', 'included.On', 'dvd', '2', 'ten-year', 'anniversary', 'documentary/interview', 'Harry', 'Belafonte', 'curious', 'watch', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'documentary', 'Belafonte', 'point', 'out', 'how', 'got', 'idea', 'wanted', 'do', 'something', 'famine', 'plaguing', 'Ethiopia', 'etc.', 'never', 'once', 'mention', 'Bob', 'Geldof', 'who', 'remember', 'time', 'was', 'Bob', 'Geldof', 'BOOMTOWN', 'RATS', 'Midge', 'Ure', 'ULTRA-VOX', 'who', 'started', 'whole', 'thing', 'song', 'Do', 'Know', 'Christmas', 'had', 'many', 'British', 'singers/musicians', 'as', 'well', 'American', 'artists', 'Jody', 'Watley', 'Kool', 'Gang', 'Irish', 'band', 'U2', 'contributing', 'talents', 'collaborating', 'single', 'British/Irish/American', 'supergroup', 'was', 'called', 'BAND', 'AID', 'was', 'created', 'help', 'relief', 'aid', 'starving', 'Ethiopia', 'single', 'DO', 'THEY', 'KNOW', 'was', 'released', 'December', '1984', 'went', 'number', 'one', 'almost', 'month', 'half', 'WE', 'ARE', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'was', 'recorded.It', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'documentaries', 'saying', 'was', 'better', 'BAND', 'AID', 'USA', 'FOR', 'AFRICA', 'really', 'small', 'potatoes', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'just', 'little', 'troubling', 'see', 'someone', 'taking', 'credit', 'historic', 'event', 'even', 'mentioning', 'Geldof', 'Band', 'Aid', 'who', 'historically', 'were', 'pre-cursors', 'Are', 'World', 'documentary', 'also', 'problems', 'happened', 'logistics', 'controversy', 'why', 'aid', 'money', 'never', 'reached', 'destination', 'surrounded', 'USA', 'FOR', 'AFRICA', 'talks', 'HANDS', 'ACROSS', 'AMERICA.Additional', 'footage', 'also', 'included', 'dvd', '2', 'including', 'live', '1986', 'American', 'Music', 'Awards', 'performance', 'WE', 'ARE', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'Belafonte', 'Jackson', 'Richie', 'Jones', 'accepting', 'various', 'awards', 'song', 'Live', 'Aid', 'concert', 'performance', 'song', 'Also', 'included', 'booklet', 'hour-by-hour', 'play-by-play', 'description', 'recording', 'session', 'reprint', '1985', 'LIFE', 'magazine', 'cover', 'story.Unless', 'actually', 'remember', 'moment', 'time', 'perhaps', 'huge', 'fan', 'one', 'artists', 'who', 'appear', 'WATW', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'watch']",We are the World - The Story Behind the Song

869491,A10DQWWRKGQ6FY,B0006IUDB2,"Eric B. Gordon ""The greatest thing we ever ha...","[1, 1]","It was April 5, the observed Good Friday of 1985.  Within an hour's time 8,000 separate radio stations had made at least one broadcast of this song called ""We Are the World,"" a seven-minute song by an organization called USA for Africa.  It was produced by Quincy Jones, written by Michael Jackson & Lionel Richie and featured both their voices, plus those of Tina Turner, Bruce Springsteen, Willie Nelson, Kenny Loggins, Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross and so many others.  The purpose of the single was to spread public awareness in the western world of famine in third-world African nations, such as Ethiopia.  It's very likely that, if there were any followers of American popular music that hadn't listened to ""We Are the world"" or heard of USA for Africa prior to this date, the chances are good that they knew about both afterwards.  And, this documentary hosted by Jane Fonda would serve to enhance that knowledge upon its release later that year.I was five years old at the time of We Are the World's popular period.  I was too young to know the meaning of starvation or where Africa was.  I do remember hearing the song very often, both on the radio and the tape player.  After we obtained a copy of this special, the whole family watched it regularly (it became one of those staples that I couldn't get away from).  One reason for this is that, it featured Jane Fonda.  I'd previously only heard her voice in audio form.  This was the first instance where I remember seeing her in front of a camera.  Also, it was excellent to see how Quincy Jones looked and to get a glimpse of people such as Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Tina Turner and Kenny Rogers in the same studio together.Twenty years later, I'd become a musician and learned a considerable amount about writing, arranging, recording and performing.  Looking back, I came to understand how significant this documentary was, being my first acquired knowledge of the recording process or what it's like being in a studio.  Also, the song and the way it was recorded harkens back in my mind to the Beatles' original version of ""Hey Jude"" from 1968.  I've never worked in a top-grade studio (all my experiences have been in project studio environments) or in audiovisual, but I do have ultimate respect for all the artists, musicians, engineers, filmmakers and crew that had a hand in the song and the videotaping of the sessions.  I'm in all their debts, as are so many of us whether or not we know it.  Someday, I hope to work in big studios (like A&M; or Lion Share) and to work with the likes of Quincy Jones or Humberto Gatica.  I'd never be able to produce another ""We Are the World,"" but I also wouldn't want to.  It's not necessary, anymore than an interest in producing another ""Hey Jude.""",5,It Was 1985.,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,2772,"['was', 'April', '5', 'observed', 'Good', 'Friday', '1985', 'hour', 'time', '8,000', 'separate', 'radio', 'stations', 'had', 'made', 'least', 'one', 'broadcast', 'song', 'called', 'Are', 'World', 'seven-minute', 'song', 'organization', 'called', 'USA', 'Africa', 'was', 'produced', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'written', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Lionel', 'Richie', 'featured', 'voices', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'purpose', 'single', 'was', 'spread', 'public', 'awareness', 'western', 'world', 'famine', 'third-world', 'African', 'nations', 'such', 'Ethiopia', 'very', 'likely', 'were', 'followers', 'American', 'popular', 'music', 'had', ""n't"", 'listened', 'Are', 'world', 'heard', 'USA', 'Africa', 'prior', 'date', 'chances', 'are', 'good', 'knew', 'afterwards', 'documentary', 'hosted', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'would', 'serve', 'enhance', 'knowledge', 'release', 'later', 'year.I', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'Are', 'World', 'popular', 'period', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'know', 'meaning', 'starvation', 'where', 'Africa', 'was', 'do', 'remember', 'hearing', 'song', 'very', 'often', 'radio', 'tape', 'player', 'obtained', 'copy', 'special', 'whole', 'family', 'watched', 'regularly', 'became', 'one', 'staples', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'One', 'reason', 'featured', 'Jane', 'Fonda', ""'d"", 'previously', 'only', 'heard', 'voice', 'audio', 'form', 'was', 'first', 'instance', 'where', 'remember', 'seeing', 'front', 'camera', 'Also', 'was', 'excellent', 'see', 'how', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'looked', 'get', 'glimpse', 'people', 'such', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'same', 'studio', 'together.Twenty', 'years', 'later', ""'d"", 'become', 'musician', 'learned', 'considerable', 'amount', 'writing', 'arranging', 'recording', 'performing', 'Looking', 'back', 'came', 'understand', 'how', 'significant', 'documentary', 'was', 'being', 'first', 'acquired', 'knowledge', 'recording', 'process', 'what', 'being', 'studio', 'Also', 'song', 'way', 'was', 'recorded', 'harkens', 'back', 'mind', 'Beatles', 'original', 'version', 'Hey', 'Jude', '1968', ""'ve"", 'never', 'worked', 'top-grade', 'studio', 'experiences', 'have', 'been', 'project', 'studio', 'environments', 'audiovisual', 'do', 'have', 'ultimate', 'respect', 'artists', 'musicians', 'engineers', 'filmmakers', 'crew', 'had', 'hand', 'song', 'videotaping', 'sessions', ""'m"", 'debts', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'not', 'know', 'Someday', 'hope', 'work', 'big', 'studios', 'A', 'M', 'Lion', 'Share', 'work', 'likes', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'Humberto', 'Gatica', ""'d"", 'never', 'be', 'able', 'produce', 'Are', 'World', 'also', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'not', 'necessary', 'anymore', 'interest', 'producing', 'Hey', 'Jude']",We are the World - The Story Behind the Song

Harry Belafonte takes us through the decision making process that ensured that every dollar donated ended benefiting the people of Africa. This video is highly educational and an eye opening experience.The stars that join for this effort are: Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Kenny Rogers, James Ingram, Tina Turner, Billy Joel who arrives at the concert in the company of Christie Brinkley, Diana Ross, Dionne Warwick, Willie Nelson, Al Jarreau, Bruce Springsteen, Kenny Loggins, Steve Perry, Daryl Hall, Huey Lewis, Cyndi Lauper, Kim Carnes, Bob Dylan and Ray Charles. Also singing as part of the chorus we were delighted to see Dan Aykroyd, Harry Belafonte, Lindsey Buckingham, The News, Sheila E, Bob Geldof, Jackie, Tito, Randy, LaToya and Marlon Jackson, Waylon Jennings, Bette Midler, John Oates, Jeffrey Osborne, The Pointer Sisters and Smokey Robinson.As we heard the song created for such a worthy cause we realized that ""there comes a time, when we head a certain call, when the world must come together as one because there are people dying and it is time to lend a hand to life... the greatest gift of all.""And we are glad that we invested in this effort because ""we can't go on, pretending day by day, that someone, somewhere will soon make a change."" It is up to us because ""we are all part of God's great big family, and the truth is that we have come to understand that love is all we need.""Don't miss it, it is simply magnificent!",5,"A worthy effort, a highly humanistic endeavor, don't miss it!",1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,2724,"['recent', 'death', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'brought', 'memories', 'collaboration', 'brought', 'many', 'artists', 'produce', 'Are', 'World', 'decided', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'honor', 'King', 'Pop.We', 'are', 'world', 'was', 'created', 'raise', 'necessary', 'funds', 'help', 'Ethiopia', 'back', '1985', 'was', 'suffering', 'consequences', 'unusual', 'lack', 'rain', 'political', 'decisions', 'did', 'not', 'advance', 'needs', 'people.Jane', 'Fonda', 'reasons', 'production', 'are', 'world', 'simply', 'magnificent', 'self', 'viewers', 'engage', 'effort', 'eliminate', 'famine', 'world.The', 'video', 'in-depth', 'look', 'making', 'video', 'how', 'powerful', 'stars', 'left', 'egos', 'door', 'collaborated', 'create', 'one', 'best', 'pieces', 'ever', 'performed.Michael', 'Jackson', 'Lionel', 'Richie', 'wrote', 'song', 'thanks', 'help', 'producer', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'were', 'able', 'attract', 'super', 'talent', 'contribute', 'time', 'voices', 'hope', 'selling', 'enough', 'records', 'make', 'difference.Disc', '1', 'documentary', 'narrated', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'ending', 'final', 'version', 'song', 'released', 'world.Disc', '2', 'Africa', 'witness', 'devastation', 'sickness', 'resulting', 'famine', 'Harry', 'Belafonte', 'decision', 'making', 'process', 'ensured', 'dollar', 'donated', 'ended', 'benefiting', 'people', 'Africa', 'video', 'highly', 'educational', 'eye', 'opening', 'experience.The', 'stars', 'join', 'effort', 'are', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Lionel', 'Richie', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'James', 'Ingram', 'Tina', 'Turner', 'Billy', 'Joel', 'who', 'concert', 'company', 'Christie', 'Brinkley', 'Diana', 'Ross', 'Dionne', 'Warwick', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Al', 'Jarreau', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'Kenny', 'Loggins', 'Steve', 'Perry', 'Daryl', 'Hall', 'Huey', 'Lewis', 'Cyndi', 'Lauper', 'Kim', 'Carnes', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Also', 'singing', 'part', 'chorus', 'were', 'delighted', 'see', 'Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'Harry', 'Belafonte', 'Lindsey', 'Buckingham', 'News', 'Sheila', 'E', 'Bob', 'Geldof', 'Jackie', 'Tito', 'Randy', 'LaToya', 'Marlon', 'Jackson', 'Waylon', 'Jennings', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'John', 'Oates', 'Jeffrey', 'Osborne', 'Pointer', 'Sisters', 'Smokey', 'Robinson.As', 'heard', 'song', 'created', 'such', 'worthy', 'cause', 'realized', 'time', 'when', 'head', 'certain', 'call', 'when', 'world', 'must', 'come', 'together', 'one', 'are', 'people', 'dying', 'time', 'lend', 'hand', 'life', 'greatest', 'gift', 'are', 'glad', 'invested', 'effort', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'pretending', 'day', 'day', 'someone', 'somewhere', 'will', 'soon', 'make', 'change', 'are', 'part', 'God', 'great', 'big', 'family', 'truth', 'have', 'come', 'understand', 'love', 'need', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'simply', 'magnificent']",We are the World - The Story Behind the Song

And then, music legends generously donated their talents to an urgent cry for help. The rest is history.The first DVD contains the documentary We Are The World: The Story Behind The Song. It's a really in depth look at the recording process. After going on a star trip meeting other stars, the singers get down to the gruelling process of recording.It was really tedious for them to sing their parts over and over, but the reality is hard work. Some got visibly tired as they came straight from the awards show and worked from night till morning.Of course, you get the music video here. Quality is very good, just like they released it yesterday. There are plenty of extras like individual artists recording their parts. Believe me, there are A LOT for your viewing pleasure, though some are repeated from the main feature.DVD 2 details the journey to Africa and the geographical, logistical and other difficulties faced in bringing aid to people. A very eye opening documentary.The best parts for me are the Grammy and American Music Awards presentation. The latter had Diana Ross gathering the music artists to sing the song as a group. As the camera travels round the stage, there's a glimpse of a very young Whitney Houston, then a rising star.Another special feature are three Live Aid recordings by BBC and MTV, the most comprehensive one from ABC. The sound system is pretty volatile, you cannot hear Harry Belafonte sing. Artists who did not sing on the record are here live - Sheena Easton, Patti LaBelle, Melissa Manchester. But someone let out what sounded like a large belch during the performance plus other weird noises. Couldn't Image have edited it out?

Documenting a cluster of American hitmakers creating a pop single to help aid the African famine plight (Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie and Quincy Jones worked up the original demo after seeing the success of Band Aid's similar musical juggernaut), the greatest moments on this two disc set are the outtakes from two of the bigger rock stars involved in the recording of the 1985 hit. Bob Dylan is shown looking incredibly uneasy and unimpressed when an impromptu rendition of the Banana Boat Song breaks out amongst the gathered throng, while his solos show a man desperately unsure of his own ability until Quincy Jones reassures him. On the flipside of the coin Bruce Springsteen is seen on the extra footage giving a powerful first take of his lines, somehow balancing passion with anguish in a way the irksome Al Jarreau couldn't dream of. All up, this isn't as wearing as it could well have been.
