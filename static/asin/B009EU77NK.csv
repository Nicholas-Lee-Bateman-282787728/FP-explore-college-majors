1596185,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B009EU77NK,Paul Allaer,"[6, 7]","""For a Good Time, Call..."" (2012 release; 85 min.) brings the story of two girls down on their luck. Katie (played by Ari Graynor) lives in a fabulous apartment in New York which she no longer can afford. Lauren (played by Lauren Miller) has just been told by her boyfriend that he wants to ""evaluate"" their relationship and she needs to move out. A mutual friend, Jesse (played by Justin Long), brings the girls together and even though they have an unpleasant history together from their college days, they really have no choice but to try to make things work. And how they do! Lauren finds out that Katie, in order to make some extra money, works on the side as a phone sex operator. Lauren figures out that if they do this on their own, they'll make much more money.While a heavy emphasis is made in the promotional materials for the movie (both on the poster and in the trailer) about the sex phone operation, the movie is in fact much more about how two girls who used to hate each other become unlikely best friends 10 years later. In that sense, the movie is the female version of a ""brocom"".Lauren Miller, in addition to starring, also co-wrote and co-produced the movie. She is the wife of Seth Rogen, who appears (uncredited) in a short but hilarious cameo. I had first noticed her in last year's ""50/50"" movie, and with this she simply confirms that she is a rising star in the Hollywood indie scene. Kudos as well for Ari Graynor, who shines as Lauren's room mate and comes across like a Bette Midler reincarnated. But a special shout-out to Justin Long, who is just fantastic as Jesse. I also want to point out that the soundtrack plays a big role in the movie, and features plenty of indie talent such as Unknown Mortal Orchestra, the Generationals, High Highs, and Los Campesinos!, just to name those. With its light-hearted touch, it is just the perfect end-of-Summer/early Fall movie when everyone's grown tired of big budget action hero movies and never-ending explosions.",4,"Light-hearted ""sisters"" comedy",1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,1991,"['Good', 'Time', 'Call', '2012', 'release', '85', 'min', 'story', 'two', 'girls', 'down', 'luck', 'Katie', 'played', 'Ari', 'Graynor', 'fabulous', 'apartment', 'New', 'York', 'no', 'longer', 'can', 'afford', 'Lauren', 'played', 'Lauren', 'Miller', 'just', 'been', 'told', 'boyfriend', 'evaluate', 'relationship', 'move', 'out', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Jesse', 'played', 'Justin', 'Long', 'girls', 'together', 'even', 'have', 'unpleasant', 'history', 'together', 'college', 'days', 'really', 'have', 'choice', 'try', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'how', 'do', 'Lauren', 'out', 'Katie', 'order', 'make', 'extra', 'money', 'side', 'phone', 'sex', 'operator', 'Lauren', 'out', 'do', 'own', ""'ll"", 'make', 'much', 'more', 'money.While', 'heavy', 'emphasis', 'made', 'promotional', 'materials', 'movie', 'poster', 'trailer', 'sex', 'phone', 'operation', 'movie', 'fact', 'much', 'more', 'how', 'two', 'girls', 'who', 'used', 'hate', 'other', 'become', 'unlikely', 'best', 'friends', '10', 'years', 'later', 'sense', 'movie', 'female', 'version', 'brocom', '.Lauren', 'Miller', 'addition', 'starring', 'also', 'co-wrote', 'co-produced', 'movie', 'wife', 'Seth', 'Rogen', 'who', 'uncredited', 'short', 'hilarious', 'cameo', 'had', 'first', 'noticed', 'last', 'year', '50/50', 'movie', 'simply', 'rising', 'star', 'Hollywood', 'indie', 'scene', 'Kudos', 'as', 'well', 'Ari', 'Graynor', 'who', 'Lauren', 'room', 'mate', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'reincarnated', 'special', 'shout-out', 'Justin', 'Long', 'who', 'just', 'fantastic', 'Jesse', 'also', 'want', 'point', 'out', 'soundtrack', 'big', 'role', 'movie', 'features', 'plenty', 'indie', 'talent', 'such', 'Unknown', 'Mortal', 'Orchestra', 'Generationals', 'High', 'Highs', 'Los', 'Campesinos', 'just', 'name', 'light-hearted', 'touch', 'just', 'perfect', 'end-of-Summer/early', 'Fall', 'movie', 'when', 'everyone', 'grown', 'tired', 'big', 'budget', 'action', 'hero', 'movies', 'never-ending', 'explosions']","For a Good Time, Call..."

When they meet they remember they hate each other and it becomes tense, until they find a way to make more money then they ever dreamed of. The preview to this movie made it look very funny to me and I was excited about watching this. The cameos were great and the movie was funny but it was a little more girly then I was expecting. This is more then a movie about phone sex, its about friendship and being true to yourself. As cheesy as that sounds watch it and you will see what I mean.
