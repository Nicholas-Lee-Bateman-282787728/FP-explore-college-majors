I'm a HUGE fan of all things BigFoot and especially love hokey BigFoot flicks that I can sit back, enjoy, and harken back to my days as a kiddo watching Saturday afternoon creature features and ""In Search Of."" This puzzling collection of scenes (I won't even call it a film or movie) is really not enjoyable in any sense of the word.  Even really BAD BigFoot movies (and hey, aren't they all folks?) can be entertaining in their own atrocious ways.  But the underlying foundation of any BigFoot movie is...well...you know...BigFoot.  Not so with this peculiar video assemblage that wishes it was the Blair Witch Project.  Instead we have the 1970's era wierd lights and interdimensional meanderings of (apparently) demonic creatures that perhaps, just maybe, are fighting with (unseen) BigFoot and humans. I think.  But in actuality, I just gave up on caring about halfway through, when there had been zero BigFoot action and lots and LOTS of bad acting, especially the grizzled old fart they have playing the mountain man.  He reminded me most of the guy from Mark Borchardt's movie Coven (Google it) in overall demeanor and level of ham. However, whereas Borchardt's buddy only got a few minutes of screen time, the maestro in this flick has WAY too much screen time to practice his ""ACTIIINNGG!"" Predictably, none of the characters here behave like real people and none of the action is especially interesting, suspensful, or entertaining.  Again, there is NO BigFoot.  This blunt fact is even screamed at the end by one of the actors who hollers to no one in particular that ""IT'S NOT BIGFOOT!!!""  Great.  Cool. Ok. So why in the hell is the movie titled ""BIGFOOT something something?""  Is this like a final middle finger in the face of the paying audience? I have no idea and at this point, I've surrendered too many synapses to the pathogen that is this release to ponder it further.  I'll keep an eye out for the writer and director's next film, which I understand is to be called ""YETI something something"" but will focus instead on very aggressive, invisible salamanders.",1,"""IT'S NOT BIGFOOT!!!""

The film is genuinely creepy and very suspenseful at times without relying on the old &#34;cat jumps out&#34; in a moment of staged tension. If you pay attention you catch shadowy figures move across the background from time to time, lending to the creepy stalking feel of the movie. The nighttime assault on the cabin is probably the best such scene I've ever seen in a bigfoot movie. It was great. There are a lot of questions left unanswered, which annoys some viewers. I was loving the whole thing right up until then end, which I found really disappointing; certainly it was a different approach, but I didn't like it one bit, although I THINK I got it after a little thought.

The acting is, as one reviewer put is, one-dimensional (in fact, if you're interested in a great case study for one dimensional acting from an entire cast, this is it - though the lead acotr and actress are perhaps the worst of the lot and would be better suited to cheesy commercials), there are NO scares, and they couldnt even make this remotely believable (and yes, I do get the irony in that comment when discussing a Bigfoot movie).

1584475,A185QFJRTB5W93,B00930LJ1W,"TrailsEndWild ""Writer/Researcher""","[6, 9]","Okay, in the same style as other ""found footage"" types of films, Bigfoot: The Lost Coast Tapes does not have the best acting in the world.  The thing is, these folks are not supposed to be actors.  They are supposed to be people acting like actors which typically (in real life) leads to bad acting.  It is because of this simple premise that the film works.  The Drybeck character stole the show.  Also, the nods to Loren Coleman (cryptozoologist) were quite humorous.  There is enough horror and ""shock"" moments to keep many in the genre happy, as well as some images that are just plain cool.  I will not reveal any of them (because I want ot keep this spoiler free), but all I can say is: always watch the background!  Also look for the subtle imagery and foreshadowing (Hey, is that a pine tree with missing branches? What does that have to do with anything? It's called a clue to the reveal, pass it on!) I understand why the spoon-fed masses are so unhappy with the ending.  It doesn't give them what they expected.  True cryptid or cryptozoology fans will be blown away by the ending.  Yeah, all you other people out there who are bashing the ending, here is a hint: IT ACTUALLY DOES MAKE SENSE!  But I'd guess you'd have to read a book or do a little research on your own to understand.  The haters can go back to watching their Hollywood schlock (or maybe some hockey where they might pick up another clue).  This film is made for a niche audience.  I for one found it an awesome way to kill an hour and a half.
