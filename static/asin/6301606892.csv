258039,A34VV92TSLC37R,6301606892,Adam Craig,"[0, 4]","Casualties of War stars Michael J. Fox in one of his first ""serious"" roles as an actor, along with Sean Penn who is great in the film.  The film follows a group of young soldiers, led by Penn on a mission in Vietnam, in which Sergeant Meserve (Penn) decides to kidnap a young Vietnamese girl whom he claims is VC so the soldiers can ""have some fun"" along the way of their new mission.The episode with the kidnapped girl is the meat of the film, with a very good beginning and a somewhat disappointing ending sandwiching the shocking, very well-done middle.  The film does feature some great acting, and De Palma, as always, finds a way to shock and maybe disgust his viewers.  The main problem with the movie is that it just never feels really complete.  After the incident, we are taken back to base camp, where Fox has to decide whether to report the incident to his superiors.  While the film does an admirable job of trying to show the dilemma that Fox is facing, the viewer is ultimately left uncaring, due to the lagtime between the incident and the vindication that finally comes near the end of the film.While Casualties of War is definitely not a bad film, it had the unfortunate distinction of being released at the same time as Full Metal Jacket, Born of the Fourth of July, and Platoon.  And compared to those, the film doesn't quite stand up.  It is an admirable attempt by De Palma to truly transcend genres, but I think that I, and all other De Palma fanboys, hope that he just sticks to his bread and butter.",3,De Palma's foray into Vietnam has mixed results,1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,1524,"['Casualties', 'War', 'stars', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'one', 'first', 'serious', 'roles', 'actor', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'who', 'great', 'film', 'film', 'group', 'young', 'soldiers', 'led', 'Penn', 'mission', 'Vietnam', 'Sergeant', 'Meserve', 'Penn', 'kidnap', 'young', 'Vietnamese', 'girl', 'whom', 'VC', 'soldiers', 'can', 'have', 'fun', 'way', 'new', 'mission.The', 'episode', 'kidnapped', 'girl', 'meat', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'beginning', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'sandwiching', 'shocking', 'very', 'well-done', 'middle', 'film', 'feature', 'great', 'acting', 'De', 'Palma', 'always', 'way', 'shock', 'maybe', 'disgust', 'viewers', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'just', 'never', 'feels', 'really', 'complete', 'incident', 'are', 'taken', 'back', 'base', 'camp', 'where', 'Fox', 'decide', 'report', 'incident', 'superiors', 'film', 'admirable', 'job', 'trying', 'show', 'dilemma', 'Fox', 'facing', 'viewer', 'ultimately', 'left', 'uncaring', 'due', 'lagtime', 'incident', 'vindication', 'finally', 'end', 'film.While', 'Casualties', 'War', 'definitely', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'had', 'unfortunate', 'distinction', 'being', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'Platoon', 'compared', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'stand', 'up', 'admirable', 'attempt', 'De', 'Palma', 'truly', 'transcend', 'genres', 'think', 'other', 'De', 'Palma', 'hope', 'just', 'bread', 'butter']",N/A

258047,A24F1UX8ZT5IXY,6301606892,C.J. Hustwick,"[8, 10]","While ""Casualties of War"" is not nearly as well know or respected as ""Platoon"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", or ""Apocalypse Now"" I think it is the best of the major Vietnam films. This is an unsparing indictment of the dehumanization of war, and Sean Penn is the most realistic villain of any of the films. It irks me that if this were European, or made a couple of decades earlier, it would be considered a masterpiece -- meanwhile anything Stanley Kubrick touched turned to cinematic gold.Things get off to a bit of a rocky start as De Palma frames the story as a flashback, starting out with a couple of scenes involving combat and warfare heroics. While the action is impressive, the direction is melodramatic and even a bit hammy. On the other hand, it's almost like De Palma is recreating some of the mood and spirit of a 1940s war film -- it's not gritty or cynical like ""Platoon"" or many other recreations of Vietnam. I have to think this was intentional. Still, I am not a Michael J. Fox fan in any way.But the story starts solidifying and things get really underway once the seemingly stoic and courageous sergeant, played by Sean Penn, comes up with the idea of ""requisitioning"" a Vietnamese girl for some ""portable R&R;"" on their next mission into the bush. What proceeds is an incredibly harsh, gut-wrenching portrayal of desperate, confused young men abusing, raping, and eventually murdering an innocent young woman. The aftermath of the rape is the best directing De Palma has ever done. Thuy Thu Le should always be remembered for her performance. Like others have said before me, it's almost difficult to take as a passive viewer -- it is truly one of the most powerful moments in any film I have ever seen.This is not a ""sideshow"" of war -- this true story cuts to the very sickness of war itself, and the toll it takes on all human life. Much more than the bloated & contrived ""Apocalypse Now"", or the somewhat aloof ""Full Metal Jacket"", De Palma's film pins the viewer in some unbelievably tense and realistic scenes of bullying, intimidation, and savagery. This is the true face of war stripped of its theatrics and machismo. This is the by-product of men pushed past the brink of their morals and humanity. It is the very same thing at the heart of Oliver Stone's excellent film, ""Platoon."" But I believe it is explored in more depth here.Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn are both very good in their roles --  I think it is by far the best work either actor has ever done. Fox, although wince-inducing as an infantry soldier at the beginning of the film, eventually earns his keep as a young man trying to maintain his composure as the world turns to hell around him. Sean Penn's portrayal of a charming and sadistic leader is spot-on. This is exactly how bullies act, exploiting people's weaknesses and preying on the need for acceptance. They make it all so simple if you follow their lead, but if you don't, then you'd better be able to fight until the end. Robert Duvall strutting shirtless on the shores of a river delta has nothing on this. And the thing is, I still think that you have to view Penn's character ambiguously. He is obviously a very feeling person -- unlike, say, Tom Berenger's character in ""Platoon"".I am a supporter of our armed services, but unfortunately it would seem that after a horrendous string of incidents in Iraq, Okinawa, and despicable sexist conduct about the U.S.S. Enterprise by its captain, our military is still infested with the kind of deplorable soldiers as are portrayed in this film. ""Casualties of War"" was meant to be a wake-up call and a harsh indictment of militarism gone horribly wrong, all the way from the privates on up the chain of command. Our military is more harmed by men of such low caliber than can be repaired by billions of dollars in defense spending.I honestly think this film is superior to ""Paths of Glory"", and for me rests right alongside ""Das Boot"" as one of the most powerful anti-war films ever made.  I normally do not write reviews which are this long, but ""Casualties of War"" has never been given the credit it deserves, and watching it over twenty years since its theatrical release, I found it more meaningful than ever before.",5,One of the Most Brutal War Films Ever Made,1299196800,"03 4, 2011",2011,4216,"['Casualties', 'War', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'respected', 'Platoon', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'think', 'best', 'major', 'Vietnam', 'films', 'unsparing', 'indictment', 'dehumanization', 'war', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'most', 'realistic', 'villain', 'films', 'were', 'European', 'made', 'couple', 'decades', 'earlier', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'masterpiece', 'meanwhile', 'anything', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'touched', 'turned', 'cinematic', 'gold.Things', 'get', 'bit', 'rocky', 'start', 'De', 'Palma', 'story', 'flashback', 'starting', 'out', 'couple', 'scenes', 'involving', 'combat', 'warfare', 'heroics', 'action', 'impressive', 'direction', 'melodramatic', 'even', 'bit', 'hammy', 'other', 'hand', 'almost', 'De', 'Palma', 'recreating', 'mood', 'spirit', '1940s', 'war', 'film', 'not', 'gritty', 'cynical', 'Platoon', 'many', 'other', 'recreations', 'Vietnam', 'have', 'think', 'was', 'intentional', 'Still', 'am', 'not', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'fan', 'way.But', 'story', 'solidifying', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'underway', 'seemingly', 'stoic', 'courageous', 'sergeant', 'played', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'up', 'idea', 'requisitioning', 'Vietnamese', 'girl', 'portable', 'R', 'R', 'next', 'mission', 'bush', 'What', 'incredibly', 'harsh', 'gut-wrenching', 'portrayal', 'desperate', 'confused', 'young', 'men', 'abusing', 'raping', 'eventually', 'murdering', 'innocent', 'young', 'woman', 'aftermath', 'rape', 'best', 'directing', 'De', 'Palma', 'ever', 'done', 'Thuy', 'Thu', 'Le', 'should', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'performance', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'almost', 'difficult', 'take', 'passive', 'viewer', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'moments', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen.This', 'not', 'sideshow', 'war', 'true', 'story', 'cuts', 'very', 'sickness', 'war', 'toll', 'human', 'life', 'Much', 'more', 'bloated', 'contrived', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'somewhat', 'aloof', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'De', 'Palma', 'film', 'viewer', 'unbelievably', 'tense', 'realistic', 'scenes', 'bullying', 'intimidation', 'savagery', 'true', 'face', 'war', 'stripped', 'theatrics', 'machismo', 'by-product', 'men', 'pushed', 'brink', 'morals', 'humanity', 'very', 'same', 'thing', 'heart', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'excellent', 'film', 'Platoon', 'believe', 'explored', 'more', 'depth', 'here.Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'think', 'far', 'best', 'work', 'actor', 'ever', 'done', 'Fox', 'wince-inducing', 'infantry', 'soldier', 'beginning', 'film', 'eventually', 'keep', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'maintain', 'composure', 'world', 'hell', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'portrayal', 'charming', 'sadistic', 'leader', 'spot-on', 'exactly', 'how', 'bullies', 'act', 'exploiting', 'people', 'weaknesses', 'preying', 'need', 'acceptance', 'make', 'so', 'simple', 'follow', 'lead', 'do', ""n't"", 'then', ""'d"", 'better', 'be', 'able', 'fight', 'end', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'strutting', 'shirtless', 'shores', 'river', 'delta', 'nothing', 'thing', 'still', 'think', 'have', 'view', 'Penn', 'character', 'ambiguously', 'obviously', 'very', 'feeling', 'person', 'say', 'Tom', 'Berenger', 'character', 'Platoon', '.I', 'am', 'supporter', 'armed', 'services', 'unfortunately', 'would', 'seem', 'horrendous', 'string', 'incidents', 'Iraq', 'Okinawa', 'despicable', 'sexist', 'conduct', 'U.S.S', 'Enterprise', 'captain', 'military', 'still', 'infested', 'kind', 'deplorable', 'soldiers', 'are', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Casualties', 'War', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'wake-up', 'call', 'harsh', 'indictment', 'militarism', 'gone', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'way', 'privates', 'chain', 'command', 'military', 'more', 'harmed', 'men', 'such', 'low', 'caliber', 'can', 'be', 'repaired', 'billions', 'dollars', 'defense', 'spending.I', 'honestly', 'think', 'film', 'superior', 'Paths', 'Glory', 'right', 'Das', 'Boot', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'anti-war', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'normally', 'do', 'not', 'write', 'reviews', 'are', 'long', 'Casualties', 'War', 'never', 'been', 'given', 'credit', 'watching', 'twenty', 'years', 'theatrical', 'release', 'found', 'more', 'meaningful', 'ever']",N/A

258049,A8YSA65M8ILK2,6301606892,"cobaltspectre ""Water Rabbit""","[3, 8]","First off, I sincerely respect Penn's acting skills; and, while I like Michael J. Fox personally and find him appealing in lighter roles such as ""Back to the Future,"" he projected to me the aura of one of those soldiers destined not to survive the rigors of prolonged combat.  With my respect for Penn undiminished, far more than in other films of the genre that I've seen, I could never stop seeing these ""soldiers"" as actors playing a part; the female victim was the only character who allowed me to totally suspend disbelief (all the worse for me).As another reviewer observed, casting the roles of participants of a real-world atrocity with actors of a different race seems to go beyond my idea of permissible Hollywood license and deep into propaganda territory.  Portraying genuine minority heroes with white actors would provoke outraged protests from whichever community was denied their rightful reflected glory.  If this film is to be taken seriously as history, as it strives to be, I don't accept that they needed big-name star power to attract an audience, or that they just couldn't find any actors of the appropriate race talented enough to play their real-world counterparts.  ""Whitewashing"" the racial component in what purports to be a true story is, to the extent it was done, inexcuseable.  The producers could have easily fictionalized anything they liked and populated it with a squad of the most popular and convenient societal scapegoat figures imaginable and made a movie representative of the issue(s) they wished to address.  But, instead, they chose give their creation the added dramatic weight of a story that is supposed to have really happened as presented, forcing you to witness an atrocity that is not fiction.  I believe that the price demanded for such additional dramatic weight is the utmost faithfulness to the facts, including those that the creators might wish were different.Rape and other atrocities have been commonplace in warfare for as long as there has been warfare, and no side can claim innocence.  That's an age-old truism.  It's not pretty subject matter, but neither is just about anything else in war.  When your life has been reduced to little more than grim survival, and virtually all moral landmarks have been eradicated for expediency, except to follow orders, normal social conventions can't seem very real, anymore.  Like most of the audience, I was not in that situation, so, like most of the audience, I can only be disgusted by what I see unfold in this film.  I find violence against defenseless non-combatants to be particularly objectionable.  No doubt, far worse things have been carried out in times of war, and I'm relieved that I don't have to carry the memory of them around with me as I've carried the memory of the atrocities portrayed in this film around with me for the 20 years since I saw it in the theater.  It received favorable reviews, and I was anxious to see Penn in another film.  But, in hindsight, I wish I'd never seen it.  I would have been more comfortable watching a symbolic, representative piece of fiction than having to bear in mind that the experiences portrayed by the actress in this film actually happened to someone.I knew that war was an ugly, arbitrary, violent, tragic, and often sadistic place to be without seeing this film.  I've read All Quiet on the Western Front, countless non-fictional accounts of WWII, viewed numerous historic war documentaries utilizing contemporary combat footage, and watched countless Hollywood products such asPaths of Glory,Apocalypse Now - The Complete Dossier (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition),Platoon (Special Edition),Full Metal Jacket, and myriad other films (of all genres).  And, while I was fortunate enough not to have to be in this kind of environment, myself, many of the people who've passed through my life had all manner of personal experiences to tell me about WWII, the Korean War, Vietnam, and Desert Storm.  I learned all that a person really needs to know about war without this film.  All I can say this added to the pile was a mild case of post-traumatic vicarious stress disorder, a condition that, for all I know, exists only in me from watching this movie.  I can't think of who needs to see this film.  If you're already emotionally numb enough not to be bothered by it, then the message will be lost on you; and if you're at all sensitive, this will just upset you.  It doesn't work as an action movie, since the central crime runs through virtually the whole thing like a huge scratch on the print; it doesn't give you any satisfied sense of justice being done in the end, because the system is just as bad after the experience, and the punishments, when they weren't dismissed on technicalities, were ultimately dwarfed by the crime.  I won't totally trash this film because it is photographed competently, and the acting is fully adequate.  But I can't recommend one of the few films I wish I could erase from my memory.",2,Overkill,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,4991,"['First', 'sincerely', 'respect', 'Penn', 'acting', 'skills', 'like',

258050,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,6301606892,Cubist,"[5, 8]","Casualties of War came out towards the end of the trend of Vietnam War movies in the 1980s after the likes of Oliver Stone, Stanley Rubric and others had tried their hand at it. By the time Brian De Palma's film came out the public had grown tired of this sub-genre and, despite glowing reviews from critics, Casualties did not perform as well as hoped at the box office. The theatrical version wasn't quite the cut that De Palma would have preferred and this new ""Extended Cut"" presents his original intentions.Michael J. Fox was primarily known as a sitcom actor and for a string of lightweight comedies (Teen Wolf, The Secret of My Success, et al) but the underrated (if not flawed) Bright Lights, Big City hinted at a capacity for drama that he showcased to greater effect in Casualties. Fox does a nice job of conveying the moral dilemma that his character faces. He is the film's moral centre and the one we are meant to identify with. His scenes with Penn have the requisite intensity with Fox wisely underplaying to Sean Penn's over-the-top Sergeant.Penn plays the obvious villain of the film and is a real monster. You can see it often in the psychotic gleam in his eyes. At times, his performance veers into caricature as he lays on the New York accent a little too thick and his grotesque facial expressions are a little too garish to be believable. That being said, one has to admire his fearlessness as an actor to play such a truly unlikable character.Penn (and the rest of the cast) are let down by David Rabe's screenplay. He has essentially written a morality play but it resorts to broad strokes when shades of gray would have been much more effective (as in Mystic River which showcased Penn's talents much more effectively). Rabe does a good job with the relationships between the soldiers and how the younger, more inexperienced ones are subservient to the veterans because that is their right - they've earned it due to their experience in combat. Casualties of War is a flawed film but a visually interesting one as is customary with De Palma's body of work. He expertly uses the entire widescreen frame in many scenes showing off his command of composition. It's a shame that the content of the film wasn't up to the same quality as the style.This new ""Extended Cut"" runs six minutes longer than the previous edition and mixes some of the deleted scenes from that DVD and some original footage never seen before.New to this edition is ""Eriksson's War - A Conversation with Michael J. Fox,"" an interview where Fox talks about how he got involved in the film and what attracted him to it. This is an excellent interview with the actor as he recounts several good anecdotes.""The Making of Casualties of War"" largely features De Palma talking about the movie. He had wanted to make it since he read the original article in 1969 but the opportunity to film it did not present itself until he was able to parlay the success of The Untouchables.",4,Not without its flaws...,1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,2962,"['Casualties', 'War', 'came', 'out', 'end', 'trend', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'movies', '1980s', 'likes', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Stanley', 'Rubric', 'others', 'had', 'tried', 'hand', 'time', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'public', 'had', 'grown', 'tired', 'sub-genre', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'critics', 'Casualties', 'did', 'not', 'perform', 'as', 'well', 'hoped', 'box', 'office', 'theatrical', 'version', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'cut', 'De', 'Palma', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'new', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'original', 'intentions.Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'was', 'primarily', 'known', 'sitcom', 'actor', 'string', 'lightweight', 'comedies', 'Teen', 'Wolf', 'Secret', 'My', 'Success', 'et', 'al', 'underrated', 'not', 'flawed', 'Bright', 'Lights', 'Big', 'City', 'hinted', 'capacity', 'drama', 'showcased', 'greater', 'effect', 'Casualties', 'Fox', 'nice', 'job', 'conveying', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'character', 'film', 'moral', 'centre', 'one', 'are', 'meant', 'identify', 'scenes', 'Penn', 'have', 'requisite', 'intensity', 'Fox', 'wisely', 'underplaying', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'over-the-top', 'Sergeant.Penn', 'obvious', 'villain', 'film', 'real', 'monster', 'can', 'see', 'often', 'psychotic', 'gleam', 'eyes', 'times', 'performance', 'veers', 'caricature', 'New', 'York', 'accent', 'little', 'too', 'thick', 'grotesque', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'garish', 'be', 'believable', 'being', 'said', 'admire', 'fearlessness', 'actor', 'play', 'truly', 'unlikable', 'character.Penn', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'let', 'down', 'David', 'Rabe', 'screenplay', 'essentially', 'written', 'morality', 'play', 'broad', 'strokes', 'when', 'shades', 'gray', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'Mystic', 'River', 'showcased', 'Penn', 'talents', 'much', 'more', 'effectively', 'Rabe', 'good', 'job', 'relationships', 'soldiers', 'how', 'younger', 'more', 'inexperienced', 'ones', 'are', 'subservient', 'veterans', 'right', ""'ve"", 'earned', 'due', 'experience', 'combat', 'Casualties', 'War', 'flawed', 'film', 'visually', 'interesting', 'one', 'customary', 'De', 'Palma', 'body', 'work', 'expertly', 'entire', 'widescreen', 'frame', 'many', 'scenes', 'showing', 'off', 'command', 'composition', 'shame', 'content', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'same', 'quality', 'style.This', 'new', 'Extended', 'Cut', 'six', 'minutes', 'longer', 'previous', 'edition', 'mixes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'original', 'footage', 'never', 'seen', 'before.New', 'edition', 'Eriksson', 'War', 'Conversation', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'interview', 'where', 'Fox', 'talks', 'how', 'got', 'involved', 'film', 'what', 'attracted', 'excellent', 'interview', 'actor', 'several', 'good', 'anecdotes', 'Making', 'Casualties', 'War', 'largely', 'De', 'Palma', 'talking', 'movie', 'had', 'wanted', 'make', 'read', 'original', 'article', '1969', 'opportunity', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'present', 'was', 'able', 'parlay', 'success', 'Untouchables']",N/A

258054,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,6301606892,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","{4.5 stars}CASUALTIES of WAR is one of the very best of the late 80s Vietnam films. Being all about the rape and murder of a young Vietnamese girl by U.S. troops, it's understandable why this film produced much controversy and why there are so many quasi-political reasons for liking/disliking it. CASUALTIES of WAR is ""based on"" something that actually happened, and I'm sure there are some departures from how exactly it all happened. While the critical aspects are obviously factual, I'm appraising this film simply as a drama and will let others quibble about how true or untrue the specifics are.Though he comes across as just a little TOO squeaky-clean, Michael J. Fox is decent in the lead role of Private Eriksson. I've noticed a number of criticisms of Sean Penn's portrayal of young charismatic Sergeant Meserve, but I find him to be an utterly convincing and memorable character and think this is one of Penn's very best performances, which is saying a lot. Those who play the other four soldiers in the understrength squad are similarly real, as are many of the supporting cast, particularly Dale Dye as Captain Hill and Ving Rhames as Lieutenant Reilly. Thuy Thu Le's strong performance as the victim is also noteworthy.Viewed simply as a war film, CASUALTIES of WAR has all the elements that anyone would look for in that genre. Before the pivotal event occurs, there is a lot of gripping combat footage of different types in different locations and situations with all the necessary plot, character development, and sense of place. Fine script too, believably quirky without falling to the stereotypical ""soldier-talk"" we often encounter in films of this sort. There are also many themes to analyze if you're into it, especially in what this film shows us about the ironies of military ""justice."" And let's not forget the basic conflict of CASUALTIES of WAR. A crime of this nature can never be justified, of course, but this film does the best that can be done in showing the how and why of it all. Some have objected because they think it makes our troops look bad. It's an unavoidable fact, however, that a number of crimes of this magnitude did in fact occur during the Vietnam War, and they occurred more often than we'd probably like to think. At the same time, I do not think it's ever suggested that all or even most American troops in that war committed acts like the one shown here.Finally, CASUALTIES of WAR has a darkly beautiful ending.",5,"""Go to hell. . .SIR!""",1397174400,"04 11, 2014",2014,2464,"['4.5', 'stars', 'CASUALTIES', 'WAR', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'late', '80s', 'Vietnam', 'films', 'Being', 'rape', 'murder', 'young', 'Vietnamese', 'girl', 'U.S.', 'troops', 'understandable', 'why', 'film', 'produced', 'much', 'controversy', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'quasi-political', 'reasons', 'liking/disliking', 'CASUALTIES', 'WAR', 'based', 'something', 'actually', 'happened', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'departures', 'how', 'exactly', 'happened', 'critical', 'aspects', 'are', 'obviously', 'factual', ""'m"", 'appraising', 'film', 'simply', 'drama', 'will', 'let', 'others', 'quibble', 'how', 'true', 'untrue', 'specifics', 'as', 'just', 'little', 'TOO', 'squeaky-clean', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'decent', 'lead', 'role', 'Private', 'Eriksson', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'number', 'criticisms', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'portrayal', 'young', 'charismatic', 'Sergeant', 'Meserve', 'find', 'be', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'memorable', 'character', 'think', 'one', 'Penn', 'very', 'best', 'performances', 'saying', 'lot', 'who', 'play', 'other', 'four', 'soldiers', 'understrength', 'squad', 'are', 'similarly', 'real', 'are', 'many', 'supporting', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Dale', 'Dye', 'Captain', 'Hill', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'Lieutenant', 'Reilly', 'Thuy', 'Thu', 'Le', 'strong', 'performance', 'victim', 'also', 'noteworthy.Viewed', 'simply', 'war', 'film', 'CASUALTIES', 'WAR', 'elements', 'anyone', 'would', 'look', 'genre', 'pivotal', 'event', 'lot', 'gripping', 'combat', 'footage', 'different', 'types', 'different', 'locations', 'situations', 'necessary', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'sense', 'place', 'Fine', 'script', 'too', 'believably', 'falling', 'stereotypical', 'soldier-talk', 'often', 'encounter', 'films', 'sort', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'themes', 'analyze', ""'re"", 'especially', 'what', 'film', 'ironies', 'military', 'justice', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'basic', 'conflict', 'CASUALTIES', 'WAR', 'crime', 'nature', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'justified', 'course', 'film', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'showing', 'how', 'why', 'have', 'objected', 'think', 'troops', 'look', 'bad', 'unavoidable', 'fact', 'however', 'number', 'crimes', 'magnitude', 'did', 'fact', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'occurred', 'more', 'often', ""'d"", 'probably', 'like', 'think', 'same', 'time', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'ever', 'suggested', 'even', 'most', 'American', 'troops', 'war', 'committed', 'acts', 'one', 'shown', 'here.Finally', 'CASUALTIES', 'WAR', 'darkly', 'beautiful', 'ending']",N/A
258055,A35YWA2V4QHOJ3,6301606892,"D. Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[19, 24]","This is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen.  It is a war movie that goes so far beyond war itself that Vietnam almost seems an afterthought.  This DVD does not showcase an specific battle or heroic stand, nor does it document any significant persons or events in the war.Rather, the approach of this story is far more basic:  what is the relationship between men &amp; women during wartime?  Is it different than during peace?  What if the woman in question is suspected of being the enemy?  What is the typical response of the military hierarchy to an alleged crime?  What can be done to minimize the opportunities of military units abusing their power and control?  (After all, armies are frequently misogynistic to begin with).Michael J. Fox belongs in a war movie just about as much as Winnie the Pooh is at home in an action movie.  However, it is for this very reason that Fox is perfect in this film.  This is not a plot that tells of manly men doing manly wartime things.  Fox' character is an average-Joe human who is mainly consumed with the notion of getting back home in one piece as opposed to being shipped back in a body bag.On a patrol, his detail (led by the masterful actor Sean Penn) decides to kidnap a Vietnamese girl whom they believe to be VC.  They use this premise (misguided or not) to justify their having their way w/her while Fox and the viewer watch helplessly.This is one of the most poignant war movies you will ever see.  The issue it addresses is very relevant despite being distasteful.  I cringe to think that the episode depicted was hardly an isolated case, whether it be a crime inflicted by the US military or any other standing army in the history of warfare.In sum, this is a jolting reminder to us that warfare and ethics are inherently unhappy bedfellows.

258056,A3KDGJX43RU5MK,6301606892,D. W. MacKenzie,"[57, 59]","Casualties of War is a unique film. There are many films that depict wartime atrocities. This one stands above the rest because of it's character development. We get to know the guilty parties, and they are not purely evil, but are in many ways quite ordinary. They seem like regular US GI's at first, just trying to survive day by day.Sean Penn's character (Sgt Meserve) leads them into an abyss, and only one of them (Eriksson, played by Micheal J Fox) refuses to enter. The others commit murder and rape, while Eriksson cringes. The separate perpetrators display trepidation, anxiousness, remorse and the lack thereof. Other characters exhibit cynicism and callousness. Their victim shows her fear alone.This film is effective because it shows all but one of the soldiers as having different and human sides. Eriksson and Diaz (John Leguizamo) know that what is happening is wrong, but one fails to stop it, and the other participates. Meserve comes up with absurd lies to try to justify what they are doing, not only for Eriksson, but for the others, and it seems even for himself. Only one character in this film (Clark) is completely inhuman. His sadistic fervor and amoral smugness makes him appear as a monster, plain and simple.This film is effective because it shows seemingly normal men in a descent into utter barbarism. Thuy Thu Le sets the mood for this by portraying the terror of their victim so well. Sympathy for the victim will surely make anyone cringe. But, it is by showing that the perpetrators, except Clark, are like most anyone that this film has its' strongest affect. How would we each fare if faced by such a situation? Who among us would stand against it? Who would succumb to it? This film strikes deeper than any horror film, with obviously inhuman monsters. It shows real people who become monsters, and is therefore vastly more effective- even more so because it all really happened.",5,Truth is more Shocking than Fiction,1051574400,"04 29, 2003",2003,1917,"['Casualties', 'War', 'unique', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'films', 'depict', 'wartime', 'atrocities', 'one', 'rest', 'character', 'development', 'get', 'know', 'guilty', 'parties', 'are', 'not', 'purely', 'evil', 'are', 'many', 'ways', 'quite', 'ordinary', 'seem', 'regular', 'US', 'GI', 'first', 'just', 'trying', 'survive', 'day', 'day.Sean', 'Penn', 'character', 'Sgt', 'Meserve', 'abyss', 'only', 'one', 'Eriksson', 'played', 'Micheal', 'J', 'Fox', 'enter', 'others', 'commit', 'murder', 'rape', 'Eriksson', 'cringes', 'separate', 'perpetrators', 'display', 'trepidation', 'anxiousness', 'remorse', 'lack', 'thereof', 'Other', 'characters', 'exhibit', 'cynicism', 'callousness', 'victim', 'fear', 'alone.This', 'film', 'effective', 'one', 'soldiers', 'having', 'different', 'human', 'sides', 'Eriksson', 'Diaz', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'wrong', 'one', 'stop', 'other', 'participates', 'Meserve', 'up', 'absurd', 'lies', 'try', 'justify', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'not', 'only', 'Eriksson', 'others', 'even', 'Only', 'one', 'character', 'film', 'Clark', 'completely', 'inhuman', 'sadistic', 'fervor', 'amoral', 'smugness', 'appear', 'monster', 'plain', 'simple.This', 'film', 'effective', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'men', 'descent', 'utter', 'barbarism', 'Thuy', 'Thu', 'Le', 'mood', 'portraying', 'terror', 'victim', 'so', 'well', 'Sympathy', 'victim', 'will', 'surely', 'make', 'anyone', 'cringe', 'showing', 'perpetrators', 'Clark', 'are', 'most', 'anyone', 'film', 'strongest', 'affect', 'How', 'would', 'fare', 'faced', 'such', 'situation', 'Who', 'would', 'stand', 'Who', 'would', 'succumb', 'film', 'deeper', 'horror', 'film', 'obviously', 'inhuman', 'monsters', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'become', 'monsters', 'therefore', 'vastly', 'more', 'effective-', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'really', 'happened']",N/A

It wasn't really until the entrance of the Vietnamese actress that things started to 'get real' in terms of acting.  From the point where she enters, you can feel the tension in the air, and seems to bring the boys to a whole new level.  Her acting is fantastic.  They couldn't have found better for the part.  She was completely beleivable and truly heartbreaking in her unaffected playing out of the role.I liked Michael J Fox in this a lot too, and I didn't think I would at first.  Seeing the ex-Family Ties sit-com star suddenly out in the jungles of Vietnam was testing my powers of forgetfulness (i.e. my ability to forget all the shows I'd already seen him in, mostly comedy).  He plays the protagonist in this one.  Again, I wasn't really buying it in the beginning, but as the movie continued, so did my appreciation for Michael J Fox.  Of course, it's natural that we side with the good guy, and he is 'the hero' in this movie, but besides the fact that we sympathize with his plight, his acting is serious and his presence beleivable.  I won't say that all the scenes in this movie are beleivable, especially from a military perspective.  It's obviously Hollywood in more than one instance, but it was still great to see Fox's powers bearing down on a dramatic role once the movie really got started.And once the story got started, there really was no turning away from it, much as you hate to witness what you know is going to go down.  When that happens, the intrigue continues with the dilemma of what to do next - ignore it or seek justice?Sean Penn was ok (was that a Brooklyn accent?) though some of the other supporting actors (John C Reilly in particular) kind of bugged.  At least at this point, we've seen their faces in so many different movies, that it becomes difficult to disassociate them from prior, or (as this movie was from '89) later performances and beleive them in this one.  Often they seemed to have a kind of self-conscous 'acting-ness' in their acting.  In other words, it didn't seem natural.  It seemed like Hollywood actors pretending to be soldiers in Vietnam, and I don't know if this was due to their already being established screen personalities, or too much 'acting' on their parts.  By contrast, the same could not be said of the Vietnamese girl.  And it was probably she (and her acting) that helped bring out better performances from some of the others.This dvd has worthwhile special features which include 'A Conversation with Michael J Fox' and 'The Making of Casualties of War' which gives us interview time with Brian DePalma.

258069,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,6301606892,J from NY,"[6, 6]","Brian De Palma's ""Casualties of War"" is not easy to watch, even for the most seasoned of ""cineastes"".  Under the influence of war and the warmakers human beings are capable of behavior that defies comprehension.  And the behavior of these men, with the mysterious exception of Pvt Errikson (Michael J. Fox), is indeed beyond comprehension.How any decent veteran or man could object to this film also defies comprehension.  It is not anti-military or anything of that kind.  On the contrary, one would have to say after a thorough review of the actual story behind the rape, torture and murder of this Vietnamese girl (she was between the ages of 16 and 18), Pvt Errikson (whoever he really is) is an example of the greatest and most courageous form of patriotism: an attempt, even in the deadliest of situations, to uphold the Constituion and military law under the most dire of circumstances.  Sean Penn plays Sgt. Meserve, a terrifying Platoon leader who, after suffering a loss in his unit, becomes a bloodthirsty monster and submits to Moloch: he proposes that the 5 men kidnap a ""VC whore"" from her village for some ""portable rest and relaxation."" Clarke (Don Harvey) who seems lacking in any conscience at all, is all for it.  Diaz (John Leguizamo in his first role) knows what the platoon is doing is wrong, but is unwilling to witness to this , too afraid or too indifferent to take a stand. Hatcher (John C. Reilly) is none too bright puppet who comments to Errikson that he ""feels like a viking"" engaging in this activity.This leaves Pvt. Erikkson completely alone.  This really is one of the worst situations a person can be put in and I cannot believe he managed to survive. His attempts to stop the repeated rapes upon the girl (played wonderfully in a demanding role by Thuy Thu Le Oanh) are foiled under threat of death.  Still he tries, and still he fails, and there is no blaming him--how could he have?  A priest whom the real Errikson met with lamented this, but the only option here would have been him killing the entire platoon or throwing himself in front of the bullets that killed her, in which case there would have been no one around to bring these ""soldiers"" to justice. Dale Dye and Ving Rhames do ominously good jobs as Errikson's military superiors who tell him to keep his mouth shut, even promising to get him out of Vietnam if he'll just get over what an unfortunate incident this brutal rape and murder of an innocent was.  This movie is, to my mind, as good as ""Serpico"", ""On the Waterfront"", or any film about one man who maintains his basic moral integrity in horrendous situations.This whole story emerged from an article that journalist Daniel Lang wrote in 1969, which is also a book.  Errikson met with him at some point and recounted the events. In reality, unlike in the film, Sgt. Meserve did not save Errikson's life and had not recently lost a bunch of men.  That's to make him more human in the movie.  Also, these guys received stiff sentences in the tribunal and sentenced to the stockade in Fort Leavenworth: however, their sentences were commuted to almost nothing.  Clarke, the man who joked about gutting the girl three times, was let out after 8 years so he could ""pursue a career in literature and philosophy"".

Why do so many truly great stories take soooooo long to reach the screen? Is it because studio executives believe everything must be dummy-downed or that American audiences can't bear to watch a real horror story like ""Casualties of War""?And this is a truly gut-wrenching story. You don't just watch this movie, turn the ""off"" switch and that's it. This story stays with you. It should.""Casualties of War"" depicts, painfully and directly, the dehumanizing nature of war. Yet, through Michael J. Fox's character (Eriksson), we see that even under these extreme circumstances, the most courageous people cling to their humanity. They don't completely resign from the human race.Personally, I consider this film far superior to any other made about the Vietnam war -- better than the much overrated ""Platoon"" and even ""Apocalypse Now.""For ""Casualties of War"" puts a very real human face on its story. While much has been said about Sean Penn's menacing and Michael J. Fox's tormented performances -- both are excellent -- I won't soon forget Thuy Thu Le, the actress who portrayed the innocent girl raped and butchered.I'm flabbergasted that one critic called this film ""unbearable"" because the victim was given so little to say and was so passive. Just how aggressive was this tiny ""girl"" supposed to be when confronted by an armed squad? She spoke but no one could understand her. They didn't care what she had to say. She wasn't human to them. And that's the whole point.What will haunt me when I recall this movie is the expressions on Thuy Thu Le's face. Horrified. Frighted. Confused. Innocent.Her performance, indeed, makes ""Casualties of War"" unbearable, from her screams as she's taken in the black of night, to her wide-eyed fear as she quakes when Michael J. Fox cleans her wounds. Thuy Thu Le's performances makes you wince.I commend De Palma for not flinching. He didn't try to soften the blows. He wanted us to be disturbed by what we witness.We care desperately for this girl. We want her to be saved. We want someone to do the right thing.And we know she is doomed.I'm surprised some studio huncho didn't say, ""The hell with the true story. We can't make a movie in which the girl isn't saved.""In the end, we as an audience are faced with the painful fact Eriksson must live with -- that she could have and should have been saved, but wasn't. Eriksson realized, even in war, that there is still a line between right and wrong. He had the courage not to cross it, yet he will be forever guilt-strickened by his failure to stop the others who did.""Casualties of War"" is a masterpiece, and as I look at it again with fresh eyes on DVD, I'm still amazed it did not receive more acclaim.

Fox) rebels against his commanding officer (Sean Penn) and other members of his patrol when they kidnap a defenceless Vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Le) and subject her to a terrifying physical ordeal.Unfairly overshadowed by the simultaneous theatrical release of Oliver Stone's pompous (but still impressive) BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY (1989), Brian DePalma's CASUALTIES OF WAR recreates a harrowing incident from the Vietnam conflict - first reported in 'New Yorker' magazine in 1969 - in which a group of otherwise decent men succumbed to their own worst impulses and committed a terrible crime. Filmed with typical cinematic bravado by master craftsman DePalma, the movie uses every inch of the scope frame to convey both the duality of the landscape (vast swathes of breathtaking countryside, where sudden death lurks around every corner) and the moral vacuum which stretches the two central characters (Fox and Penn) to breaking point.Crafted with blistering simplicity by screenwriter David Rabe (himself a Vietnam veteran and author of the acclaimed stageplay 'Streamers'), the soldiers are depicted as brave individuals whose principles have been shattered by their traumatic combat experiences, leaving Fox to essay the role of peacemaker in a world where all the rules have been turned upside down. Thu Le - a model with no prior acting experience - is truly heartbreaking as the soldiers' terrified prisoner, and her ultimate fate is so horrific (arguably the most disturbing set-piece of this director's entire career), many viewers will be too appalled to see the film through to its inevitable conclusion.

The movie has it's limitations (hence only 4 stars). Illogically the mainly white soldiers wander around the jungles of Vietnam at night without the safety benefit of any camoflauging blackface? And some of the scenes and acting are uneven and do not always fit together well. Despite these shortcomings it is still a good movie. Ennio Morricone's score adds to the emotional weight of the film and many of the actors do give good performances. Ving Rhames, Dave Dye and Sean Penn as the Sergeant are all excellent.Michael J. Fox takes a break from his usual comedy roles to give a capable performance as PFC Erikson. Erikson faces a personal crisis when his Sergeant hatches a plan to kidnap a Vietnamese girl and take her out on patrol with the squad in order to abuse her sexually. The others in the squad jump right in and follow the Sergeants lead and brutally assualt the girl. PFC Erikson puts himself in jeopardy when he refuses to take part. He immediately finds himself an outcast as he senses his buddies are growing reluctant to watch his back.This movie is not nearly as good as Platoon or Full Metal Jacket but is much better than the pretentious Hamburger Hill. These movies were all released in the late 80s when all of a sudden filmakers wanted to get the Vietnam story out there. The movie, to me, does not glorify war, nor is it anti war. It is about how one person fights to stay true to his moral beliefs even when everyone seems to have abandoned their beliefs. The moral implications the movie examines, albeit on a much smaller scale, are somewhat reminescent of Schindlers List. What would a moral person do during extraordinary circumstances when everyone around them seems to have abandoned their humanity. When people around them have no problem murdering, raping or enslaving vulnerable persons.

Much more believable than ""Platoon"", which relegated many of its characters to cartoonish caricatures, such as Junior and Bunny. In THIS film, the personalities are very recognizable as the very sort of young men who either enlisted or were drafted into that war. The characters of Meserve, Clark, Diaz, Hill and others are clearly drawn on real people and are recognizable as post war personalities, peculiar to the sixties especially, of not particularly high character.After repeated frustrations in battle, and spurred by the death of one of their number at the hands of the VC, Meserve, CO of the platoon, decides to abduct and gang rape a Vietnamese girl as revenge for the death, something most of the rest of the platoon thinks is a good idea. Ericksson, the new guy with the moral standards, opts out of the gang rape, and he thinks he has an ally in Diaz, a hispanic private of peripheral importance to the story, but when pressed by Meserve to join in, he quickly abandons Ericksson, who is left alone to report the incident to the brass of the company.He's met with stonewalling and sympathy for the PERPETRATORS, rather than cooperation, and he readily feels like HE is being cast as the villain, trying to spoil the ""fun"" of the others. Throughout all this, he has but ONE ally, a fella from another company who seems to think just like he does. Someone along the chain of command, though, also must have been in his corner, because after the girl is shot and killed by Meserve, he and the rest are all brought up on charges for the rape and murder of a civilian.Ericksson also has to endure Cpl.Clarke, a character who's actually a little more menacing than Meserve, with sunken eyes and the look and behavior of a drugged-up madman. Oddly enough, at first, just like in Platoon, Ericksson actually ADMIRES Meserve for saving his life, like Taylor initially admired Barnes, but empirical experience soon reveals what a dangerous group he's a part of. The psycho-drama, pathos and tension of this film is palpable, and it has to be one of the best Vietnam war movies as far as drama is concerned, and is definitely one of the best De Palma movies.Make sure only the people you know with the strongest stomachs watch this film, because it IS grueling in parts.

It cannot dream of holding a candle to Platoon or Saving Private Ryan, but if this is your first in the war-is-literally-and-viscerally-hell genre, be prepared to be engaged.The story line is harrowing -- four misguided American GIs in the Vietnam war get all worked up and rape+murder a woman prisoner. The fifth GI, a ""good one"" (played by an unwittingly chocolate-boyish and out-of-place M.J. Fox) is more moralistic than the four, which soon morphs into a game of libido versus ethics.The overall effect is a mixed bag. Confrontations between commanding officers and soldiers are effective, despite their sketchy outcomes. Fox also delivers an atrocious holier-than-thou speech around the middle. The ending resolution is patchy and forced, which makes one wonder if the movie should perhaps have simply recorded the incident and ended as the group returned to base.Barring Sean Penn's hearty attempts at a Bronx accent and the essence of conscience that permeates the film, there really is rather sparse material to base my recommendation on.

The girl is victimized in ""revenge"" for a previous attack upon this squad by the Viet Cong. All but one soldier in the squad participates in the rape/murder.  That soldier is played by Michael J. Fox.  Fox is excellent as the sole conscience amongst the squadron.Fox's character is so horrified by what he sees, that he is compelled to report this atrocity to his commanders.  As a result, he is vilifed by his peers and by certain superiors.  A trial of the other squadron members ensues.  I will not give away the outcome.Sean Penn as the instigator of the rape/murder is brilliant in his portrayal of the sadistic and ruthless soldier.  And Thuy Thu Le who plays the murdered Vietnamese girl is obviously a talented young actress with great emotional depth.  The rape scene itself is quite graphic and disturbing.But unfortunately, the way in which the Vietnamese girl's role is written and directed makes this character more unbearable than the rape itself.  And that should NOT be. The rape is a horrific and vile act.  But this girl's continual whimpering, coughing, clinging, and totally passive behavior is what finally became unbearable for me as the viewer.De Palma and David Rabe give the Vietnamese girl no strength,  smarts, or even a smidgeon of dignity.  The girl has the opportunity to flee when Michael J. Fox's character unties her.  But she does nothing but run back to him and thus sets herself up for more torture by the rest of the squad.Perhaps that is how the incident actually happened.

258092,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,6301606892,The Mysterious Traveler,"[5, 25]","CASUALTIES OF WAR (1989) Directed by Brian De Palma. Script by David Rabe. Score by Ennio Morricone.Starring Michael J. Fox, John C. Reilly, John Leguizamo, Ving Rhames, Sherman Howard, Amy Irving, Stephen Baldwin and Sean Penn.This, based on a true story--or rather something written during the Vietnam War for The New Yorker by someone who wanted to undercut morale and hinder the War effort---film tells the story of a group of five soldiers who, when sent on a recon patrol, four of whom kidnap, rape and then murder a Vietnamese girl. Upon returning from the patrol, the fifth soldier names names and testifies against them before a military committee resulting in their conviction.By 1989, The Left was horrified that, due to the Rambo films among others, their Vietnam War smear on American soldiers--that they were all drooling drug addicted incompetent suppressed homosexual Nazi baby killers--was being discredited and discarded to the trash heap of false history. So, digging up Comrade Rabe who spent the Vietnam War years creating the smears that The Party used to aid their Little Red Brothers in North Vietnam to write the script, this film was produced portraying American Soldiers as being drooling drug addicted incompetent suppressed homosexual Nazi baby killers.Utterly stuck in a fraudulent past, the film might just as well be made in 1969 rather than 89 for all that it acknowledges that 20 years have past and the Communist conquest of Indochina was a humanitarian disaster of Biblical proportions. But no. Communism may fall in Moscow but Party Discipline goes on forever. The film is so retro that, at one point, a character actually paraphrases John Kerry by describing the Americans as Genghis Khans.Really.As might be expected, the adherence to the Party Line hurts the film dramatically in many ways. DePalma's two main battle scenes are off in a way that is hard to put one's finger on---presumably because his sympathies are with the Reds rather than the Americans who are so incompetent here that they kill as many of themselves than they do of the enemy. In any case, there is no suspense or verve in these scenes. Rabe's dialogue...especially in the first 30 minutes is very bad and very fake in that Clifford Odets sing song repetition rhythm sort of way with characters basically saying the same thing over and over again while stopping short of clapping their hands while doing so. Why DOES the Left feel the need to repeat everything at least three times in their melodramas?? A core belief that the rabble are so ignorant that they can only be indoctrinated by constant repetition?? My my such affection for those they claim that they are trying to liberate.The film does not really come alive until the hour long kidnaping rape and murder sequence which DePalma/Rabe linger over with graphic detail and disturbing almost and probable gleeful relish. This sequence is far more brutal and detailed than anything in say THE KILLING FIELDS or indeed any filmed....of the very few... Communist atrocity in American film from easily 1970 to the present day, indicating, since the Reds did the similar and worse as their ideology dictated to literally millions of Orientals like the girl here......and still do to this day, that DePalma/Rabe really do not give a damn about this girl's tragedy other than as someone to be exploited, used and discarded for the Party and the Cause. If these criminals had not raped and murdered her, DePalma and Rape probably would have done so themselves......which in a way they do.......While Fox and the actress who plays the girl are quite good--though at one point she is dubbed by Amy Irving, one cannot say as much for the rest of the cast. While Penn's reputation is an utter mystery to me--here his performance is a bizarre cross between Huntz Hall and Rondo Hatton--, one should attempt to be fair and state that no one has any real characters to play. Everyone is an old Moscow generated propaganda construct of how the Left likes to portray the American Military. In general, the American soldier is either a hysterical incompetent or a faceless bureaucrat. If he is Black, he is either a victim of racism or high on pot(and hence absolved of any responsibility of their involvement in the War). Fox plays the decent but impotent American(presumably the noncommunist Democrat) who is incapable of stopping his fellow Americans from ""raping Vietnam."" And the four criminal soldiers are respectively...a sergeant(played by Penn) who is an effective soldier but also insane and with suppressed homosexual tendencies(He is driven over the edge when his beloved Black friend is killed by the Vietcong) aka the Gay smear, a corporal who is racist and talks of exterminating all the Vietnamese aka the Nazi smear, the third soldier(played by Reilly) is close to being retarded--unlike members of the Left who are all ""intellectuals"" and finally the fourth played by Lequizamo who is just easily led--unlike the Left who were all ""rebels."" It is all so narcissistic, masturbatory and very familiar. DePalma liked this film so much that he recently remade it as REDACTED only changing the setting to Iraq.NOTE. Modern viewers of the film may be upset by DePalma having the truth about the crime being revealed and action taken only when Fox tells it to a Chaplain. That would have to changed today with the Priest being portrayed as a drunken pedophile who tries to rape Fox.A Hollywood supports the troops film.See it or not",1,A Classic Hollywood Supports the

Not many people realize that ""Sven Eriksson"" is a real person who actually experienced much of what Michael J. Fox's character went through in the movie.But does it work as a movie?  For the most part, yes.  The two glaring problems with Casualties is the ending and some of the soundtrack music which DePalma uses to excess.The ending, as it's explained within the DVD extras, is purposely presented as uplifting.  We see Eriksson on a San Francisco BART train awaking from his bad dream/memories.  He sees a girl who could be the one who was murdered and raped in Vietnam.  He calls out the Vietnamese girl's name.  The woman responds that he must have had a bad dream, but it's all over now.  And then we get the ""uplifting"" music that rises to a crescendo.Upon viewing the movie for a second time this ending is particularly bad.  DePalma argues in the DVD extras that this positive ending was meant as a way to give the audience some relief.  However, it's so hammy that it belittles the true story that precedes it.  It's all a dream, it's all over, everything is now OK.  But everything is not OK and everything is not over.Which brings me to the one thing that this DVD should have offered - more information about the true story behind the movie.  Why not go to Vietnam and show where the incidents actually took place?  ""Eriksson"" is actually a pseudonym of the real man who has apparently been in hiding due to death threats from the men he helped put in prison.  How about some more information about where these men are today?  Perhaps nothing more can be offered about Eriksson, but at least we could have been shown in the DVD what happened to the men who committed the crimes.I give the DVD five stars because this story is important.  Americans so quickly forget these kinds of true stories.  We quickly sweep them under the rug and say it doesn't matter.

I like it and it has plenty of action in it and all, but unlike some other low-star reviews, this movie does not portray ALL American soldiers as murderers and rapists. In Vietnam, there were a few GI's who were a little f**ked in the head and what they did to quite a few Vietnamese villagers in revenge for their buddies being killed went far beyond the ways of justice. Take the My Lai incident in '68 when 2Lt. Calley's platoon was responsible for murdering over 500 villagers, including rape cases on a few people too. Not every American soldier in that platoon decided to get involved, but there are a few nutcases that decided to not let anything stop them in their goal of vengeance. So I remember that this movie didn't recklessly place the average American soldier in the level of some wannabe criminal. Soldiers like Michael J. Fox's character in the movie made their attempts to stop these crimes from taking place, but they still happened, and this movie, which is a pretty big action-thriller, will remind everyone of that.",4,The Vietnam Experience,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,1194,"['watched', 'movie', 'long', 'ago', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'scenes', 'just', 'got', 'mail', 'today', 'thought', 'should', 'say', 'few', 'things', 'movie', 'plenty', 'action', 'other', 'low-star', 'reviews', 'movie', 'not', 'portray', 'American', 'soldiers', 'murderers', 'rapists', 'Vietnam', 'were', 'few', 'GI', 'who', 'were', 'little', 'f**ked', 'head', 'what', 'did', 'quite', 'few', 'Vietnamese', 'villagers', 'revenge', 'buddies', 'being', 'killed', 'went', 'far', 'ways', 'justice', 'Take', 'My', 'Lai', 'incident', ""'68"", 'when', '2Lt', 'Calley', 'platoon', 'was', 'responsible', 'murdering', '500', 'villagers', 'including', 'rape', 'cases', 'few', 'people', 'too', 'Not', 'American', 'soldier', 'platoon', 'decided', 'get', 'involved', 'are', 'few', 'nutcases', 'decided', 'not', 'let', 'anything', 'stop', 'goal', 'vengeance', 'remember', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'recklessly', 'place', 'average', 'American', 'soldier', 'level', 'wannabe', 'criminal', 'Soldiers', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', 'character', 'movie', 'made', 'attempts', 'stop', 'crimes', 'taking', 'place', 'still', 'happened', 'movie', 'pretty', 'big', 'action-thriller', 'will', 'remind', 'everyone']",N/A

The Americans are seen as barbarians who are ignorant of everything, including the customs of the country. ""Casualties of War"" was made in 1989, long before America's current misadventures in Iraq. But just substitute desert wasteland for humid jungle to sense the deja vu this film evokes today. Everything has changed. Nothing has changed.Cast against type, Michael J. Fox is just fine, surprisingly, as a GI who applies morality to human behavior whatever the circumstance, in this case another unnecessary American war, in Vietnam. Sean Penn is even finer, unsurprisingly, as the sergeant who orders his squad to kidnap, rape and murder a civilian girl because war excuses everything, even blood lust. Fox does not participate and for that is punished by his squad and his conscience. When he tells the high command, he is dismayed to discover that ""nobody cares."" Is there a parallel here?""Casualties of War"" stings like truth. Playwright David Rabe based his script on New Yorker reportage, later enlarged into a book. Brian DePalma directs with his usual fluidity and appreciation of horror, notably the victimization of the girl, a touching Thuy Thu Le standing-in for an entire people. Fox's work is poignant in light of the actor's later ill health, and there's subtle support from John C. Reilly and John Leguizamo.

Fox as Eriksson, a member of an American squadron stationed in the deepest jungles of Southeast Asia. After his friend is killed in war, Sgt. Meserve (played by Sean Penn) wants revenge, so he leads his men to invade the home of a young vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Lee), and to take her so that the squad can ""have a little fun"". Throughout the film, the squad (excluding Eriksson) repeatedly gags, ties up, and rapes the innocent girl. When it's Eriksson's turn to take a shot at the girl, he doesn't want to do so. He tries his hardest to comfort the girl, and to make sure she stays alive. Eriksson decides to try to help her escape the hell she is going through, but he can't help her by himself. After the squad kills the girl, Eriksson tries to report the tragedy that he has witnessed, and bring justice to the front line, but his fellow soldiers loathe him for trying to do so. Definitely a must see.
