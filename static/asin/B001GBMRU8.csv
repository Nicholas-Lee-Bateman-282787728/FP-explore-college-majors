1193849,ACNW8I17RDNCW,B001GBMRU8,"Ed Mann ""Review Mann""","[7, 7]","I had the good fortune of attending the premiere of this film. Doug McIntyre is a radio man by trade, as I am, and I also play the instrument Jack Sheldon works so hard to get good at, so I was thrilled to hear of the finished product and more thrilled to see it. I now have two copies (well, one, but Doug owes me another. You see, there was some confusion in shipping... but I digress). So I come at this review knowing Sheldon's work well while gaining a new perspective on a colleague whose work I already admire, but this film outstrips all preconceived notions of what I thought Trying to Get Good would be. It's tremendous.Jack Sheldon's story is multi-faceted, like a diamond, really. You look at him from one angle and you see the comedian, the storyteller who will go as far as he wants to get a laugh, almost putting Merv Griffin in debt to the FCC (if that were possible). Turn him around and you hear a singer of amazing depth and warmth where the lyrics pour out like warm syrup and stick to your heart. Face him and you see the love of his life, his trumpet, where his skills, his true personality can glow on every level; you see his adoration of melody, his technical prowess, his individuality, yet in plain view is his dissatisfaction with performance, his desire to improve. It's as if he must, MUST get the proper response from every phrase and looks as a child might to his mother for approval. He'll seem to regard the end of a phrase as if just hearing it in full, as if someone else had played it. While on stage in one segment, he mentions to his teacher (yes, he takes lessons to this day) and says, ""I know, Uan, I was sharp. I fixed it."" Astounding coming from a legend like Jack, yet not terribly surprising. What artist doesn't strive to be better?Tragedy punctuated his life with the loss of family members, a divorce, a bout with the bottle and drugs, and only a relatively short part of the film is devoted to this subject, but at 76 (or so), he's as good a performer as I remember him on Merv. He can be seen live here in Los Angeles most evenings. And his love of LA is covered beautifully in the film.After the premiere, I approached Jack and told him how he had been an inspiration to me in my early playing days, and again with my recent reintroduction to music. He asked me, ""What do you play?"" I said, ""Trumpet."" Jack paused, grinned and said, ""Hard, isn't it?"" Great movie, Doug and Penny. Do more.",5,"Jack is not only a bill, he's money",1227139200,"11 20, 2008",2008,2440,"['had', 'good', 'fortune', 'attending', 'premiere', 'film', 'Doug', 'McIntyre', 'radio', 'man', 'trade', 'am', 'also', 'play', 'instrument', 'Jack', 'Sheldon', 'so', 'hard', 'get', 'good', 'was', 'thrilled', 'hear', 'finished', 'product', 'more', 'thrilled', 'see', 'now', 'have', 'two', 'copies', 'well', 'one', 'Doug', 'see', 'was', 'confusion', 'shipping', 'digress', 'come', 'review', 'knowing', 'Sheldon', 'work', 'well', 'gaining', 'new', 'perspective', 'colleague', 'work', 'already', 'admire', 'film', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'what', 'thought', 'Trying', 'Get', 'Good', 'would', 'be', 'tremendous.Jack', 'Sheldon', 'story', 'multi-faceted', 'diamond', 'really', 'look', 'one', 'angle', 'see', 'comedian', 'storyteller', 'who', 'will', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'get', 'laugh', 'almost', 'putting', 'Merv', 'Griffin', 'debt', 'FCC', 'were', 'possible', 'Turn', 'around', 'hear', 'singer', 'amazing', 'depth', 'warmth', 'where', 'lyrics', 'pour', 'out', 'warm', 'syrup', 'stick', 'heart', 'Face', 'see', 'love', 'life', 'trumpet', 'where', 'skills', 'true', 'personality', 'can', 'glow', 'level', 'see', 'adoration', 'melody', 'technical', 'prowess', 'individuality', 'yet', 'plain', 'view', 'dissatisfaction', 'performance', 'desire', 'improve', 'must', 'MUST', 'get', 'proper', 'response', 'phrase', 'child', 'might', 'mother', 'approval', ""'ll"", 'seem', 'regard', 'end', 'phrase', 'just', 'hearing', 'full', 'someone', 'else', 'had', 'played', 'stage', 'one', 'segment', 'teacher', 'yes', 'lessons', 'day', 'know', 'Uan', 'was', 'sharp', 'fixed', 'Astounding', 'coming', 'legend', 'Jack', 'yet', 'not', 'terribly', 'surprising', 'What', 'artist', ""n't"", 'strive', 'be', 'better', 'Tragedy', 'punctuated', 'life', 'loss', 'family', 'members', 'divorce', 'bout', 'bottle', 'drugs', 'only', 'relatively', 'short', 'part', 'film', 'devoted', 'subject', '76', 'so', 'as', 'good', 'performer', 'remember', 'Merv', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'live', 'here', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'most', 'evenings', 'love', 'LA', 'covered', 'beautifully', 'film.After', 'premiere', 'approached', 'Jack', 'told', 'how', 'had', 'been', 'inspiration', 'early', 'playing', 'days', 'again', 'recent', 'reintroduction', 'music', 'asked', 'What', 'do', 'play', 'said', 'Trumpet', 'Jack', 'paused', 'grinned', 'said', 'Hard', ""n't"", 'Great', 'movie', 'Doug', 'Penny', 'Do', 'more']",TRYING TO GET GOOD - the Jazz Odyssey of Jack Sheldon

Sound and picture quality are excellent, there's a nice helping of Jack playing and singing with his big band of the 00s, and lots of folks say nice things about him, including legendary composer Johnny Mandel (who Jack helped win an Oscar for The Shadow of Your Smile with a gorgeous solo on a melody written with him in mind), Clint Eastwood, Billy Crystal, Bill Henderson, Merv Griffin, Ross Tompkins, and Dave Frishberg. The only thing missing was a more generous helping of Jack's crazy comedy -- he's one of the funniest men alive, and many of the guests talked ABOUT it, but the producers of the video apparently felt it was too blue to take a chance on. Or maybe they didn't have the video of it. Whatever the reason, we get to hear only hints of the greatness of his comedic mind.

1193856,A6FIAB28IS79,B001GBMRU8,Samuel Chell,"[6, 7]","Well over 99% of the public is clueless about the music and significance of Charlie Parker, whose name in the jazz history books and a Hollywood biopic treatment assure at least some hope of recognition among the remaining 1%. But with Sonny Stitt or Harold Land or Hank Mobley (extraordinarily gifted saxophonists--and oft-documented on record) that 1% comes ever closer to verging on a cipher, an all-but-measurable fractional figure.  Among brilliant trumpet players of the past half century, Jack Sheldon is almost as  ""anonymous"" as the scandalously neglected Kenny Dorham or Bill Hardman.  Even those familiar with his name are as apt to respond to his screen persona (as star of a television comedy series or main chum of the late Merv Griffin) or to his speaking voice (featured on numerous commercials and children's television programs) as to his trumpet artistry, which is arguably of the same level as Miles or Dizzy or Clifford Brown.All it takes is two notes--sometimes no more than one--played by Jack during a filler-phrase gleaming through a full orchestral setting on a Peggy Lee recording for an alert listener to recognize that inimitable sound.  To say that he deserves the listener's undivided attention should go without saying, yet on a popular video site Jack can be seen playing recently under the most insensitive conditions--in a spaghetti restaurant where his trumpet is drowned out by crowd chatter.  It's high time, and gratifying, to see a film calling attention to Jack Sheldon's formidable, even prodigious, talents along with a journey that could easily be seen as archetypal--a creative musician seeking mastery of his craft and an outlet for significant self-expression in a milieu which frankly rewards neither.  At the same time, watching this film will leave some Sheldon fans feeling ambivalent--like experiencing another preachment to the choir.  It can only be hoped that viewers of this film will be motivated to seek out the best work not only of Sheldon but other neglected, even nearly forgotten jazz masters.  (Bear in mind that much of Jack's best work is recorded under the name of some other leader (""The Curtis Counce Group"" is a personal favorite, though ""Smack Up"" under the name of Art Pepper is another sterling example.)It's easy to ""blame"" Jack for getting side-tracked during his career--taking on the roles of stand-up comedian, jokester, and ""character"" actor at the expense not so much of his art (his trumpet has never failed him, even if his judgment occasionally has--it's the mass public that needs to ""try to get good"") but of the reverence that is due a creative, singular musician in an indigenous American art form that, despite the odds, has produced no small number of contenders for hall-of-fame honors.  But when you see the sobering list of embittered and self-destructive young men--and women--who could not handle the indifference and rejection let alone the poisonous substances they turned to for escape, you can only marvel not simply that Jack Sheldon became good but that he survived long enough to claim such greatness as his own (not that he ever would--he's much too modest or, some would say, insecure for that).  Lest there be doubts about Sheldon's ""seriousness"" as an artist--and at one time, some of us had them--""Trying to Get Good"" makes it plain that while Jack had his share of distractions, his was a muse that could never be accused of complacency.",5,Uplifting sermon (even if it's to the choir),1261440000,"12 22, 2009",2009,3444,"['Well', '99', '%', 'public', 'clueless', 'music', 'significance', 'Charlie', 'Parker', 'name', 'jazz', 'history', 'books', 'Hollywood', 'biopic', 'treatment', 'assure', 'least', 'hope', 'recognition', 'remaining', '1', '%', 'Sonny', 'Stitt', 'Harold', 'Land', 'Hank', 'Mobley', 'extraordinarily', 'gifted', 'saxophonists', 'oft-documented', 'record', '1', '%', 'ever', 'closer', 'verging', 'cipher', 'all-but-measurable', 'fractional', 'figure', 'brilliant', 'trumpet', 'players', 'past', 'half', 'century', 'Jack', 'Sheldon', 'almost', 'anonymous', 'scandalously', 'neglected', 'Kenny', 'Dorham', 'Bill', 'Hardman', 'Even', 'familiar', 'name', 'are', 'apt', 'respond', 'screen', 'persona', 'star', 'television', 'comedy', 'series', 'main', 'chum', 'late', 'Merv', 'Griffin', 'speaking', 'voice', 'featured', 'numerous', 'commercials', 'children', 'television', 'programs', 'trumpet', 'artistry', 'arguably', 'same', 'level', 'Miles', 'Dizzy', 'Clifford', 'Brown.All', 'two', 'notes', 'sometimes', 'more', 'one', 'played', 'Jack', 'filler-phrase', 'gleaming', 'full', 'orchestral', 'setting', 'Peggy', 'Lee', 'recording', 'alert', 'listener', 'recognize', 'inimitable', 'sound', 'say', 'listener', 'undivided', 'attention', 'should', 'go', 'saying', 'yet', 'popular', 'video', 'site', 'Jack', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'playing', 'recently', 'most', 'insensitive', 'conditions', 'spaghetti', 'restaurant', 'where', 'trumpet', 'drowned', 'out', 'crowd', 'chatter', 'high', 'time', 'gratifying', 'see', 'film', 'calling', 'attention', 'Jack', 'Sheldon', 'formidable', 'even', 'prodigious', 'talents', 'journey', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'seen', 'archetypal', 'creative', 'musician', 'seeking', 'mastery', 'craft', 'outlet', 'significant', 'self-expression', 'milieu', 'frankly', 'same', 'time', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'Sheldon', 'fans', 'feeling', 'ambivalent', 'experiencing', 'preachment', 'choir', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'hoped', 'viewers', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'motivated', 'seek', 'out', 'best', 'work', 'not', 'only', 'Sheldon', 'other', 'neglected', 'even', 'nearly', 'forgotten', 'jazz', 'masters', 'Bear', 'mind', 'much', 'Jack', 'best', 'work', 'recorded', 'name', 'other', 'leader', 'Curtis', 'Counce', 'Group', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Smack', 'Up', 'name', 'Art', 'Pepper', 'sterling', 'example', 'easy', 'blame', 'Jack', 'getting', 'side-tracked', 'career', 'taking', 'roles', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'jokester', 'character', 'actor', 'expense', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'art', 'trumpet', 'never', 'failed', 'even', 'judgment', 'occasionally', 'mass', 'public', 'try', 'get', 'good', 'reverence', 'due', 'creative', 'singular', 'musician', 'indigenous', 'American', 'art', 'form', 'odds', 'produced', 'small', 'number', 'contenders', 'hall-of-fame', 'honors', 'when', 'see', 'sobering', 'list', 'embittered', 'self-destructive', 'young', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'handle', 'indifference', 'rejection', 'let', 'alone', 'poisonous', 'substances', 'turned', 'escape', 'can', 'only', 'marvel', 'not', 'simply', 'Jack', 'Sheldon', 'became', 'good', 'survived', 'long', 'enough', 'claim', 'such', 'greatness', 'own', 'not', 'ever', 'would', 'much', 'too', 'modest', 'would', 'say', 'insecure', 'Lest', 'there', 'be', 'doubts', 'Sheldon', 'seriousness', 'artist', 'one', 'time', 'had', 'Trying', 'Get', 'Good', 'plain', 'Jack', 'had', 'share', 'distractions', 'was', 'muse', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'accused', 'complacency']",TRYING TO GET GOOD - the Jazz Odyssey of Jack Sheldon
