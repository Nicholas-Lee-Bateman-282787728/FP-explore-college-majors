1164929,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,B0019X3YZA,Crazy Jim,"[23, 23]","This is not a sequel to the Hype Williams film, ""Belly"" at all. It's a movie called Millionaire Boyz Club that was packaged as a sequel by Lionsgate in hopes of selling a few more copies. Perhaps we could let all this go, if this were actually a good film but it's not. This is the kind of movie that completely ignores logic at any cost.Where should we start? The movie stars The Game, who is a real good rapper but still needs work in the leading man department, as an ex-con named G. At the start of the film, he is told that he needs to be employed or he will go back to prison. After going to several job interviews dressed up like he's going to play ball at Rucker's Park, he gives up on the job hunt and starts dealing drugs and killing people. He still isn't employed so according to what was said earlier in the movie, he should be back in prison for parole violation.As the movie moves further, he is now the city's third biggest drug dealer and the Feds are setting up an elaborate plot to catch him. Why? Why waste man hours and tax dollars chasing someone who is.... ON PAROLE!!! They could just send him back with one phone call but then we wouldn't have a movie, would we? Instead, they send in a female agent (played by Shari Headley from Coming To America) to infiltrate his gang. Of course, she falls for him. Despite the fact that their whole relationship consists of them playing dominoes, walking through a college campus, and having sex in his apartment, we're supposed to believe that they are now heads over heels in love.This whole movie takes place in some ridiculous rap music video alternate reality. This guy is on parole for dealing drugs but is able to kill people in broad daylight, deal drugs, carry unregistered machine guns, and move into a pricey apartment without anyone being the wiser. The guy has no legal job and the Fed's are supposedly monitoring him at every corner but they can't manage to find any evidence that will stick. It's pretty bad. On top of all this, the movie is supposed to be narrated by the main character but the person narrating is obviously not The Game.I guess if you're looking for 70 minutes of illogical plot developments, played-out cliches, and hood movie stereotypes then this is the movie for you.",1,"""Belly 2"" DVD review!",1220054400,"08 30, 2008",2008,2268,"['not', 'sequel', 'Hype', 'Williams', 'film', 'Belly', 'movie', 'called', 'Millionaire', 'Boyz', 'Club', 'was', 'packaged', 'sequel', 'Lionsgate', 'hopes', 'selling', 'few', 'more', 'copies', 'Perhaps', 'could', 'let', 'go', 'were', 'actually', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'kind', 'movie', 'completely', 'logic', 'cost.Where', 'should', 'start', 'movie', 'Game', 'who', 'real', 'good', 'rapper', 'still', 'work', 'leading', 'man', 'department', 'ex-con', 'named', 'G.', 'start', 'film', 'told', 'be', 'employed', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'prison', 'going', 'several', 'job', 'interviews', 'dressed', 'up', 'going', 'play', 'ball', 'Rucker', 'Park', 'up', 'job', 'hunt', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'killing', 'people', 'still', ""n't"", 'employed', 'so', 'according', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'earlier', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'back', 'prison', 'parole', 'violation.As', 'movie', 'further', 'now', 'city', 'third', 'biggest', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Feds', 'are', 'setting', 'up', 'elaborate', 'plot', 'catch', 'Why', 'Why', 'waste', 'man', 'hours', 'tax', 'dollars', 'chasing', 'someone', 'who', 'PAROLE', 'could', 'just', 'send', 'back', 'one', 'phone', 'call', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'would', 'Instead', 'send', 'female', 'agent', 'played', 'Shari', 'Headley', 'Coming', 'America', 'infiltrate', 'gang', 'course', 'fact', 'whole', 'relationship', 'playing', 'dominoes', 'walking', 'college', 'campus', 'having', 'sex', 'apartment', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'are', 'now', 'over', 'heels', 'love.This', 'whole', 'movie', 'place', 'ridiculous', 'rap', 'music', 'video', 'alternate', 'reality', 'guy', 'parole', 'dealing', 'drugs', 'able', 'kill', 'people', 'broad', 'daylight', 'deal', 'drugs', 'carry', 'unregistered', 'machine', 'guns', 'move', 'pricey', 'apartment', 'anyone', 'being', 'wiser', 'guy', 'legal', 'job', 'Fed', 'are', 'supposedly', 'monitoring', 'corner', 'ca', ""n't"", 'manage', 'find', 'evidence', 'will', 'stick', 'pretty', 'bad', 'top', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'narrated', 'main', 'character', 'person', 'narrating', 'obviously', 'not', 'Game.I', 'guess', ""'re"", 'looking', '70', 'minutes', 'illogical', 'plot', 'developments', 'played-out', 'cliches', 'hood', 'movie', 'then', 'movie']",Belly 2: Millionaire Boyz Club

1164933,A8SCX6VUTE05H,B0019X3YZA,"Nuisance ""the rebel""","[3, 3]","Belly was an okay movie. Hype Williams chose style over substance with that flick. While it was visually pleasing the movie didnt give you anything you hadnt seen before. The only difference between that and this monstrosity is the last 10 minutes with Ben Chavis and DMX. That made all the difference between the two movies. Belly started out ignorant and somewhat gained a conscious. Belly 2, or should I call it what it really is : Billionaire Boyz Club is dumb from beginning to end.Plot/story: G(played by The Game) is just released from jail and goes back to a life of crime after failing to get a job on several occasions.Opinion: This movie is awful and is BORING beyond belief. The acting is wooden and the dialogue is the hood lingo dumbed down to an excess. One positive thing I can say about this movie: Shari Headley is still FINE after all these years but she is wasted on this low budget bore as well as Ed O'Ross who gives the most hammiest performance of his career. He plays a crooked cop so unconvincingly that its rivals Danny Aiello's crooked cop routine in Harlem Night in badness. Shari Headley plays Alexis, an undercover agent who end up falling for ""G"" even though he is about as charming as a rottweiler with rabies. They have about as much chemistry as fire and water and the sex scene they have in the movie is so bad that it makes Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck's crappy sex scene in Gigli seem steamy and arousing. I laughed so hard, I almost pooped and pissed in my pants at the same time. I also laughed my a** off when I saw Bryce from the R&B; group, Groove Theory, playing a crime boss with JHERI CURLS! Yeah THAT Bryce. Game's acting is just as bad as Nas and T-Boz's acting in the original Belly. He was terrible in Waist Deep but his performance there was better than it was in here. Stick to the microphone, kiko! Closing comments: Dont let my comments as well as the other negative comments about this movie be in vain. Its 76 minutes of pure boredom and you know a movie is bad when the mindless violence in it bores you to tears. 76 minutes of pure boredom guaranteed to put you to sleep and make you dumber than you were before you watched it.TWO THUMBS DOWN!",1,Belly Up,1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,2203,"['Belly', 'was', 'okay', 'movie', 'Hype', 'Williams', 'chose', 'style', 'substance', 'flick', 'was', 'visually', 'pleasing', 'movie', 'didnt', 'give', 'anything', 'hadnt', 'seen', 'only', 'difference', 'monstrosity', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'Ben', 'Chavis', 'DMX', 'made', 'difference', 'two', 'movies', 'Belly', 'started', 'out', 'ignorant', 'somewhat', 'gained', 'conscious', 'Belly', '2', 'should', 'call', 'what', 'really', 'Billionaire', 'Boyz', 'Club', 'dumb', 'beginning', 'end.Plot/story', 'G', 'played', 'Game', 'just', 'released', 'jail', 'back', 'life', 'crime', 'failing', 'get', 'job', 'several', 'occasions.Opinion', 'movie', 'awful', 'BORING', 'belief', 'acting', 'wooden', 'dialogue', 'hood', 'lingo', 'dumbed', 'down', 'excess', 'One', 'positive', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'Shari', 'Headley', 'still', 'FINE', 'years', 'wasted', 'low', 'budget', 'bore', 'as', 'well', 'Ed', ""O'Ross"", 'who', 'most', 'hammiest', 'performance', 'career', 'crooked', 'cop', 'so', 'unconvincingly', 'rivals', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'crooked', 'cop', 'routine', 'Harlem', 'Night', 'badness', 'Shari', 'Headley', 'Alexis', 'undercover', 'agent', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'falling', 'G', 'even', 'about', 'as', 'charming', 'rottweiler', 'rabies', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'chemistry', 'fire', 'water', 'sex', 'scene', 'have', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'crappy', 'sex', 'scene', 'Gigli', 'seem', 'steamy', 'arousing', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'almost', 'pooped', 'pissed', 'pants', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'laughed', 'a**', 'when', 'saw', 'Bryce', 'R', 'B', 'group', 'Groove', 'Theory', 'playing', 'crime', 'boss', 'JHERI', 'CURLS', 'Yeah', 'Bryce', 'Game', 'acting', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'Nas', 'T-Boz', 'acting', 'original', 'Belly', 'was', 'terrible', 'Waist', 'Deep', 'performance', 'was', 'better', 'was', 'here', 'Stick', 'microphone', 'kiko', 'Closing', 'comments', 'Dont', 'let', 'comments', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'negative', 'comments', 'movie', 'be', 'vain', '76', 'minutes', 'pure', 'boredom', 'know', 'movie', 'bad', 'when', 'mindless', 'violence', 'tears', '76', 'minutes', 'pure', 'boredom', 'guaranteed', 'put', 'sleep', 'make', 'dumber', 'were', 'watched', 'it.TWO', 'THUMBS', 'DOWN']",Belly 2: Millionaire Boyz Club

Though compared to the East Coast, the West Coast is totally a different world and very very laid back and not as helter skelter as out east so some may find this movie laid back and boring.  The acting is subpar, which is sort of surprising considering that Michael K. Williams (Omar from the Wire) and Felicia Pearson (Snoop from the Wire) is either co-starring or making a cameo in this movie.  The Game won't be confused as a great actor.  Novice at best but the fact they do have some decent actors and actresses in this film who are terrible.  I don't know per se if it's them or the director or the screenwriters, this movie basically turned into an overglorified State Property.  However, it wasn't all bad and I've seen a lot worse hood flicks than this.  However, for those hyped off the first belly because of the energy DMX brought to the first one will be sadly disappointed by this one with Game's lack of energy and the director's lack of creativity with the characters.
