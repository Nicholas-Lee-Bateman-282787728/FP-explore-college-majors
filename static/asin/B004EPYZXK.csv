So what went wrong? Well, I found Apollo 18 to be -- gasp! -- kinda boring; despite some eerily suspenseful images, the movie takes way too long to achieve liftoff. Apollo 18 is the only surviving footage of NASA's final moon mission -- a mission that went so horribly wrong that the U.S. Government has denied its existence ever since. But what did those intrepid explorers find on earth's only satellite? I won't give it away, if you are crazy enough to watch it.

Otherwise, you are paying too much to see what amounts to nothing. Plus, if you have spent money to buy a hi-def television, this movie will irritate you even more, since you will spend the whole movie thinking you are back in 1982....with a broken 8mm movie reel....static, film spots and all.I'll admit that the movie sounded like it might be interesting when I read the back of it at the video store. I became wary when all the previews were for zombie movies, (bad zombie movies at that) but figured, ok. I rented a horror movie, I should expect them to preview other horror movies. However, this is not a horror movie, unless you would put ""The Goonies"" in the horror section. My seven year old daughter would have loved this movie, and she wouldn't have blinked an eye or worried one bit about being scared.I have to agree with another reviewer who said the whole ""found footage"" thing is getting old. The sad thing is, when I was done watching the movie (yes, I watched it all, unfortunately) I thought, Gee, too bad. This could have been a much better movie. The whole premise of 'scary stuff on the moon' could have been a thriller, if it had been done right.All in all, do yourself a favor and don't buy this movie until you have rented it first.

1401918,A2SWW3OWEGLN2O,B004EPYZXK,Andrew Kear,"[4, 5]","I originally saw this film displayed at the checkout counter at Rite Aid, so my expectation of the film was low. I bought it realizing that sometimes these unknown films are hidden treasures. Apollo 18 was not one of those films. The one thing I have to commend the filmmakers for was creating a realistic depiction of the 70's space program. The grainy simulated stock footage certainly gave the impression the footage was actually from the 70s. I should mention the production design and the simulated lunar surface have never been more realistically created as they are in this film. The filmmakers obviously studied meticulously the Apollo flights, which are now approaching forty years old.  Obviously, the filmmaker's eye for realism was done in order to make this a realistic horror film in the tradition of the Blair witch project, and several paranormal activity movies.However, Apollo 18 falls short in the area of drama. There are only a few shocks in the film, while the rest of the story malingers on. Apparently, the astronauts along with a Soviet counterpart craft are sent to the moon to expose a contaminated life form. The astronaut's nemesis turns out to be spider-like creatures that hatch out of lunar rocks. To say this is ludicrous is an understatement. For the rest of the film basic science is thrown out the window and replaced with cheap thrills. The spider creatures themselves are generic looking CGI effects. The rest of the film resembles Alien, where the space spiders chase the hapless astronauts through the ship. None of the astronauts are allowed home.How could the filmmakers in this day and age even contemplate any living organism on the moon? Maybe if the film was set on Mars it would at least be a bit more believable. This plot scenario would have worked better in the 50s, but today it is just silly. Then again there are those who still believe we did not land on the moon.

1401924,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B004EPYZXK,blackaciddevil,"[1, 2]","""Found footage"" horror films are a dime a dozen these days are words well spoken. Seems everywhere you look that some director is going that route. Sometimes, it makes me wish there was never a Blair Witch Project ever made for everyone to follow. Course, there was and, like remakes, it's something everyone is doing to make a buck filmwise these days. Despite that, there have actually been some original ones that were worth the effort to be made. So, where does Apollo 18 fit in, in all this?Apollo 18 tells the story of a covert moon landing. The crew is tasked with setting up security cameras around the moon for national security reasons that are kept secret. While one is left in orbit, two of the astronauts land on the moon and begin their mission. Yet, during their mission, strange events begin to happen that suggest they are not alone there. When they come across a soviet ship, they assume that it is the soviets causing these strange events but they, all too soon, find out that it is something else.I'll admit, I was taken in by the story. For the most part, the movie provided an ominous, spooky atmosphere. The way the movie was made actually made it seems like it was the 'real' thing..with all its' camera angles and different perspectives. It really drove home til....&lt;SPOILER ALERT> we find out that that 'something else' was actually killer alien rocks(huh?)? Wha..? Mmmkay. I could buy killer aliens...or them coming across some other alien conspiracy...but killer alien rocks(and that's why they took samples from the moon)? Come on.

So, when I heard about a found footage movie based on space, well, I was excited. Space is scary. We don't know what's going on out there. And, for a little bit, Apollo 18 did an amazing job at bringing that scariness to us. That is, until we see what's going on.I'll be frank, Apollo 18 is bad. They do nothing to make us care about any of the characters, you won't even remember any of their names. The only thing they did right was the moral dillemmas they created. While watching the movie I kept thinking how stupid they were, how if it was me I would just kill him at the first sign of infection. Yet, when I really thought about it, I would've done the exact same thing as the character. It all goes back to my initial thought, space is scary. There's no one out there to save you if something goes wrong. That's the only thing they did right though. The ending was nothing short of aggrivating and I was so irritated at how dumb they were about everything.It may just be me, but if I'm on the moon and weird stuff starts happening the last thing I would do is leave my lander and start investigating. Nevermind the fact that...SPOILER ALERTThey found a Russian lander with blood in it and a dead astronaut. No way. I'd cash out and sit in my lander till I was radioed to leave.

Nearly 30 years later, their footage has been found. If you aren't already a fan of the ""found-footage"" genre, APOLLO 18 is unlikely to change that fact, but for anyone who enjoys watching in horror through the shaky first-person perspective of the camera will find this to be another fresh new take on the format. Director Gonzalo L&oacute;pez-Gallego has taken great care in making every scene feel authentic by properly aging the footage and dressing down the technology to fit the early 1970's. The cramped space station and craterous moon setting add the the believability, and allow for a suspension of disbelief as we travel alongside the cosmonauts in zero-gravity. While this particular style does lend credibility to the plot, it is also cause for a lot of expected slow-downs in the pace, with the action being spread thin throughout the entire run-time. Fear and paranoia do set in much like in THE THING once the men discover that there is life on other worlds.

The three astronauts could tell no one about the mission &#8211; not even their families.  Unfortunately, shortly after making a successful lunar landfall, the astronauts discover that they aren&#8217;t alone up there &#8211; and that the government already knew about it.  The best of America&#8217;s best reached the pinnacle of their dreams, only to find out they were nothing more than expendable guinea pigs for a circle of lying government officials.  For me, Apollo 18 represents the ultimate &#8220;found footage&#8221; concept.  We&#8217;re talking about a secret lunar mission here, and that pretty much trumps any concept involving teenagers falling victim to some unknown force out in the middle of the woods.  It just doesn&#8217;t get any more isolated than sitting on the moon without any comm signal to Earth or even to the lunar orbiter.  I can&#8217;t say that this movie met all of my lofty expectations &#8211; but it does represent a pretty darn good and certainly entertaining attempt.As the story goes, everything about this mission was indeed secret &#8211; until recently, when someone uploaded dozens of hours of footage to a website called lunartruth.com.  This movie, we are told, comes out of that extraordinary footage.  The filmmakers do a good job in terms of special effects, making the various pieces of footage look as if they came from different quality cameras.  You don&#8217;t see these guys bounding across the barren tundra because of the reduced gravity, but that would have been difficult to recreate &#8211; especially in those bulky vintage spacesuits &#8211; anywhere but the surface of the moon itself.  The astronauts are fairly stoic, as well &#8211; certainly much less so than some of the real Apollo astronauts were.  They&#8217;re committed to the mission, though, installing the DOD scanners and cameras and searching around the area.  That all changes when they find someone else&#8217;s footprints in the sand.  Those tracks lead them to some rather extraordinary discoveries.  They demand answers from the guys back on Earth, but few are forthcoming &#8211; and then they lose all communications whatsoever.  The only thing they do know is that people from the DOD &#8211; and presumably at least some of their NASA bosses &#8211; knew what they would encounter but didn&#8217;t share any of that information with them.The movie isn&#8217;t all that scary or creepy, but there&#8217;s plenty of mystery and suspense on hand once things begin to fall apart.  The acting is superb, which contributes to the sense of realism the film holds throughout its running time.  In the end, while the story may be pure science fiction, it&#8217;s all too easy to believe that the government would actually do something like this.",4,Compelling and realistic story of a top secret mission to the moon,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,3140,"['know', '8217', 's', 'hard', 'do', 'try', 'imagine', 'U.S.', 'government', 'would', 'actually', 'lie', 'American', 'people', '17', 'was', 'not', 'final', 'lunar', 'mission', '1974', 'Apollo', '18', 'was', 'launched', 'part', 'top', 'secret', 'Department', 'Defense', 'mission', '8211', 'ostensibly', 'put', 'kind', 'fancy', 'new', 'radar', 'tracking', 'equipment', 'South', 'Pole', 'moon', 'three', 'astronauts', 'could', 'tell', 'one', 'mission', '8211', 'not', 'even', 'families', 'Unfortunately', 'shortly', 'making', 'successful', 'lunar', 'landfall', 'astronauts', 'discover', 'aren', '8217', 'alone', 'there', '8211', 'government', 'already', 'knew', 'best', 'America', '8217', 'best', 'reached', 'pinnacle', 'dreams', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'were', 'nothing', 'more', 'expendable', 'guinea', 'pigs', 'circle', 'lying', 'government', 'officials', 'Apollo', '18', 'ultimate', '8220', 'found', 'footage', '8221', 'concept', '8217', 're', 'talking', 'secret', 'lunar', 'mission', 'here', 'pretty', 'much', 'concept', 'involving', 'teenagers', 'falling', 'victim', 'unknown', 'force', 'middle', 'woods', 'just', 'doesn', '8217', 'get', 'more', 'isolated', 'sitting', 'moon', 'comm', 'signal', 'Earth', 'even', 'lunar', 'orbiter', 'can', '8217', 't', 'say', 'movie', 'met', 'lofty', 'expectations', '8211', 'represent', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'story', 'everything', 'mission', 'was', 'indeed', 'secret', '8211', 'recently', 'when', 'someone', 'uploaded', 'dozens', 'hours', 'footage', 'website', 'called', 'lunartruth.com', 'movie', 'are', 'told', 'extraordinary', 'footage', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'terms', 'special', 'effects', 'making', 'various', 'pieces', 'footage', 'look', 'came', 'different', 'quality', 'cameras', 'don', '8217', 'see', 'guys', 'bounding', 'barren', 'tundra', 'reduced', 'gravity', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'recreate', '8211', 'especially', 'bulky', 'vintage', 'spacesuits', '8211', 'anywhere', 'surface', 'moon', 'astronauts', 'are', 'fairly', 'stoic', 'well', '8211', 'certainly', 'much', 'less', 'so', 'real', 'Apollo', 'astronauts', 'were', '8217', 're', 'committed', 'mission', 'though', 'installing', 'DOD', 'scanners', 'cameras', 'searching', 'area', 'changes', 'when', 'find', 'someone', 'else', '8217', 's', 'footprints', 'sand', 'tracks', 'lead', 'rather', 'extraordinary', 'discoveries', 'demand', 'answers', 'guys', 'back', 'Earth', 'few', 'are', 'forthcoming', '8211', 'then', 'lose', 'communications', 'only', 'thing', 'do', 'know', 'people', 'DOD', '8211', 'presumably', 'least', 'NASA', '8211', 'knew', 'what', 'would', 'encounter', 'didn', '8217', 'share', 'information', 'them.The', 'movie', 'isn', '8217', 'scary', 'creepy', 'there', '8217', 's', 'plenty', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'hand', 'once', 'things', 'begin', 'fall', 'apart', 'acting', 'superb', 'sense', 'realism', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'end', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'pure', 'science', 'fiction', '8217', 's', 'too', 'easy', 'believe', 'government', 'would', 'actually', 'do', 'something']",Apollo 18

Apollo 18 is the latter. The premise is that moon rocks are deadly aliens waiting to turn you into blood dripping guys with blood shot eyes! I guess whoever wrote the screenplay of this godforsaken movies couldn't quite make up their minds: zombies or hemorrhagic plague victims who miraculously no longer need air. Next off there is zero atmosphere on the moon. Sorry there is no life. If there was any life at one time it was sterilized by the sun's radiation billions of years ago. If there is any life, it would be microbial and it would have a hard time knocking over flags and tipping over land rovers! Next the government has sent four previous Apollo missions to the moon. By that time if something kinky is going on do you think they would send three of the most highly (and expensively) trained men on earth to certain death just to set up a bunch of monitoring cameras? Please! A simple quarantine would do! The aliens don't have factories building rocket ships! And if the moon rocks are so dangerous, what are the astronauts doing bring MORE back to earth? Duh? Sorry, tea-party fantasies aside, even the U.S. government is not that moronic.This is a depressing and boring film that leaves you feeling empty when you leave the theater.

1401949,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B004EPYZXK,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","APOLLO 18 (Dir. Gonzalo L&oacute;pez-Gallego, Writ. Brian Miller, Prod. the Weinstein brothers, 2011, 87 minutes) is a really spectacular technical and artistic achievement. One of the best I have ever watched, in fact. Purporting to be stolen classified footage leaked onto the internet in 2011, it tells the story of the 3-man mission to the moon, Apollo 18, set in the mid-1970s.Let me offer a disclaimer regarding an erroneous attitude that seems to be running rampant through the other reviews of APOLLO 18: this film in my view is NOT a ""found footage"" mockumentary. Stupid things like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and all its evil offspring do not come close to APOLLO 18. This is an artistic coup-de-grace; it also says it is official government footage stolen from the DOD. So please do not compare it to ""found"" movies.Never does it depart from its frames of footage, never does it try to be a mockumentary (which is what I would call it, technically) and never is there any anachronism. Best of all, never is there even remotely mediocre acting - it is all 100% believable.Also, though I am spoiling the heck out of this anyway, I have to say this film does something else unique: it is the only film that coaxes you to a website. When you go there, the site purports to have been censored and refers you back to the film itself. Genius!Landing on the moon, Capt. Ben Anderson (the super-gorgeous Warren Christie) and Cmdr. Nate Walker (that great craggy-faced dependable Lloyd Owen) find evidence of Russians who've been there first. Later they find one dead Russian cosmonaut and a bunch of space spiders. That's right, space spiders. Meanwhile on the main capsule monitoring is Lt. Col. John Grey (the equally impressive Ryan Robbins).One problem - really the only one - this film has is its lack of internal logic. That is to say, the cosmonauts surmise on their own that the Department of Defense sent them on this mission to die on the moon as victims of the aliens. The trouble is that's where the film went haywire with its own otherwise flawless internal mechanics. Space spiders a la ALIEN?? Seriously? Alien-possessed astronauts? Sheesh. What a waste of fantastic material. The only clue I have about all this is someplace where I read this mission reveals the reason we have never returned to the moon.That is about as believable as the idea that we have never really been to the moon in the first place.This thing had me so riveted and tense I developed a stomach ache, and I did read the beleaguered NASA's forced statement that this was not a documentary but a work of fiction. Also there is no score, just very realistic sound. THAT is good stuff ... but I cannot get over the weak and silly payoff. What are we supposed to take away from the internal logic of the story? The government screws over its heroes? It lies to everyone, even to itself? There are giant space spiders living on the moon? Wikileaks is a marvel and Julian Assange is a hero?What the film does actually show is the cosmonauts setting up listening equipment that then does not function; soon they are cut off from Houston and their transmissions are jammed. So something's awry.Aside from all that and the officers' guesses as to what has been done to them, the viewer ends up no wiser than they. The parting scene, which is JFK's actual speech in which he said we go to the moon because it is difficult, was no more illuminating - though I got a kick from the epilogue shots showing the 3 astronauts and saying they had 'officially' died in mundane missions on earth.Now a word about the ""hand-held camera work"" so many people mention. The camera work here is not all hand-held and it is sheer folly to believe that. Much of it is well-placed, stable camera footage very much like that we get to see from all the manned space missions on TV. Let me tell you a little secret: the director and cinematographer knew exactly what they were doing; they knew exactly how to do it. So you may expect some hand-held footage. The rest is simply too real and too good to try to kill by explanation here. SEE it for yourself.What this film did show me in my devious moments is that the original moon landing might very well have been faked if they used people as talented as this film used. I thought of that because in a very good book I recently read, it was mentioned that Stanley Kubrick was the culprit behind the ""fake footage"" of the moon landings. And yes, I am a solid believer that we went to the moon and men walked there.The only other thing that left me impressed but wanting way more was the delightful Warren Christie. That man is so gorgeous he'd make the statue of Winston Churchill turn gay. I wanted to see more of him, but there is one hilarious and revealing scene that showed me plenty of one of Christie's fabulous assets. Oh ... aside from his great acting, that is.My advice is you see this PG-rated, super-spooky and totally illogical piece of genius. I cannot say how they did it, but they made this look so real that I'm glad we have recognizable actors. They could have really fooled me for a few seconds had they used only talented amateurs.",5,"Houston, PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1350172800,"10 14, 2012",2012,5156,"['18', 'Dir', 'Gonzalo', 'L',

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 1]","APOLLO 18:As I've said elsewhere, I think it's hard not to enjoy a quality conspiracy, and mankind's only manned off-world moon missions have been the subject of quite a few.  First, there's the one that claims that the United States never went to moon, that it was all faked, shot on a soundstage somewhere in California, Arizona, or New Mexico.  Then, there's the one that claims the Apollo missions were actually the cover story; what really happened was that we went to moon to discover who had been there before.  Of course, there's another one - related and similar - that claims the photography from the moon has been censored or edited to remove evidence of the moon's original colonization by a master race.  Then, there's the fact that the moon is hollow.  And then there's this other one ...I think you get the point.  For ever story about the moon, there are probably dozens of others, and they all point to some grand conspiracy relating to NASA's cover-up of either (A) life out there or (B) things are not what they seem.What APOLLO 18 does it does reasonably well, and that's basically to present a classic conspiracy story.  It takes the significant elements of several of these conspiracies - that some Apollo missions were done in secret, that mankind did in fact find life on that presumed lifeless rock - and stirs them all up into one hefty mix.  The makers presume that the footage from one of these secret missions was somehow miraculously returned to Earth, leaked onto the internet, and spliced together into a complete whole.  As is the case in these ""found footage"" films, it has a tendency to be all `herky' and `jerky' cam coverage, and APOLLO 18 is no exception to that rule.  If you look too closely, you may see the strings being pulled behind the curtains, but, out front, it's just your basic ""boy-meets-monster"" story.  There's nothing wrong with it on that level; don't ask too many questions, and you're bound to be entertained, if only mildly.The disc includes a good handful of alternate endings which, sadly, gives the sense that the creators weren't entirely sure which way they wanted to go with the yarn they were spinning.  While I found that a bit of a disappointment, I also shrug it off because, minimally, I admire them for their creativity.  There are also a handful of deleted and/or extended scenes worth viewing; while they don't add much to the basic premise, there are a few that flesh out these characters (or ""victims"", if you prefer) quite well.

I went in with relatively low expectations since there are very few found footage movies that actually entertain me. Going all the way back to The Blair Witch I have found the technique more annoying than anything else.In this case it was used quite effectively as they cut from camera to camera to show footage of the crew as they encountered... strange happenings on the moon. But the fundamental problem remains which is that it's distracting from the story.I spent a lot of time thinking about the cleverness of how they mimicked the 70s film reel look and the graininess of this sort of footage. It also distanced me from the characters because I was always conscious I was looking at them through a camera.The idea was clever, the acting and script more than serviceable and at times there was a fair amount of tension.

This is a shame as there are some aspects of this that are genuinely good, but, at the end of the day, it fails.Here's the scoop. An Apollo mission is sent to the moon at the behest of the D.O.D. Getting there is fine but upon their arrival they find the Russians had already been there and something obviously went wrong. Before long things start going wrong for them as well.This is actually directed quite well. The mixture of film and video footage does give the viewer the feeling of being there with the crew. The sets are good. I felt as though I were on the moon and in the landing module. The acting was real tasty as well. All three of the primary players gave very natural, compelling performances. The scares, however, were cheap. They were almost all of the ""jump"" variety. There were a few things that were scary/creepy but not enough. That is a shame because, given the premise, this could have driven the creepy dial to 11.The problem comes in at the script level. The writers tried to be subtle in the way the various plot points were introduced but, at the end, I was confused. What was the point of the mission? This is difficult to write about so as not to introduce spoilers, but, were these guys merely bait? How much did the D.O.D. know before they introduced the mission? Some of the script pointed in the direction of us checking out if the Russians had, in fact, gone there. Other plot points pointed indicated that the D.O.D. knew what these guys would find when they got there. If that's the case, then what was the point?This didn't hurt to watch by any means but I felt as though my time would have been better spent elsewhere.",3,Good in all the Wrong Places,1315008000,"09 3, 2011",2011,1751,"['Here', 'have', 'found', 'footage', 'movie', 'nothing', 'expand', 'explore', 'genre', 'shame', 'are', 'aspects', 'are', 'genuinely', 'good', 'end', 'day', 'scoop', 'Apollo', 'mission', 'sent', 'moon', 'behest', 'D.O.D', 'Getting', 'fine', 'arrival', 'find', 'Russians', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'something', 'obviously', 'went', 'wrong', 'long', 'things', 'start', 'going', 'wrong', 'well.This', 'actually', 'directed', 'quite', 'well', 'mixture', 'film', 'video', 'footage', 'give', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'being', 'crew', 'sets', 'are', 'good', 'felt', 'were', 'moon', 'landing', 'module', 'acting', 'was', 'real', 'tasty', 'as', 'well', 'three', 'primary', 'players', 'gave', 'very', 'natural', 'compelling', 'performances', 'scares', 'however', 'were', 'cheap', 'were', 'almost', 'jump', 'variety', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'were', 'scary/creepy', 'not', 'enough', 'shame', 'given', 'premise', 'could', 'have', 'driven', 'creepy', 'dial', '11.The', 'problem', 'script', 'level', 'writers', 'tried', 'be', 'subtle', 'way', 'various', 'plot', 'points', 'were', 'introduced', 'end', 'was', 'confused', 'What', 'was', 'point', 'mission', 'difficult', 'write', 'about', 'so', 'not', 'introduce', 'spoilers', 'were', 'guys', 'merely', 'bait', 'How', 'much', 'did', 'D.O.D', 'know', 'introduced', 'mission', 'script', 'pointed', 'direction', 'checking', 'out', 'Russians', 'had', 'fact', 'gone', 'there', 'Other', 'plot', 'points', 'pointed', 'indicated', 'D.O.D', 'knew', 'what', 'guys', 'would', 'find', 'when', 'got', 'there', 'case', 'then', 'what', 'was', 'point', 'did', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'watch', 'means', 'felt', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'spent', 'elsewhere']",Apollo 18

This is a spooky, creepy flick. Which I really liked.The movie early on has just the right amount of liking the main characters and connecting with their friendship together. So much more than most movies that are plot driven.Yes, there were a couple of times something could have popped out of the dark and scared the viewer, but it didn't happen and I think that was part of the suspense because I was expecting it.The special effects were good, making the setting and ""things happening"" believable.The acting was well done. Better than most SciFy Channel movies.For me there were one or two plot holes, but they weren't so critical it didn't ruin the movie for me.OVERALL: Without giving too much away, I liked the entire premise of the story and the explanation of why this was the last visit to the moon.

1401957,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B004EPYZXK,Erik North,"[57, 66]","Suppose, following the official final lunar mission of Apollo 17 in December 1972, that the once-aborted Apollo 18 mission had been taken over by the Pentagon and sent to the Moon on a highly secret mission?  That's the premise behind the 2011 film APOLLO 18, a film that is not only a conspiracy tract, but also something of an outer-space shocker a la the 1979 blockbuster ALIEN.The premise of this pseudo-documentary sci-fi enterprise is that, under a cloak of secrecy so great that apparently not even the same American media that uncovered the truth of Watergate knows about, the Department of Defense sent a three-man crew to the Moon on Apollo 18 in December 1974 on an errand that the crew clearly knew nothing about beforehand.  Everything seems to go well at first; the two men (Warren Christie; Lloyd Owen) who land on the Moon in the lunar module ""Liberty"" make their landing as routine as anything we saw during the real Apollo program (with the exception, of course, of the Apollo 13 mission of 1970, which almost took a fatal turn).  But once they get there, they discover what would appear to be an actual Russian lunar module a mere three miles from their landing site; and when they enter the module, they see the interior is in a shambles, with blood over the control panels, and a couple of very dead Russian cosmonauts.  Even more, Own and Christie discover tracks made on the Moon's surface that are neither theirs nor those of the cosmonauts--indicating, of course, extra-terrestrial life (a premise that defies a lot of scientific credibility since, at least during the actual Apollo missions, no evidence of such a thing was ever found on the Moon's airless surface).  But then the extra-terrestrial creatures, which look like mini-crabs, appear out of the lunar rocks, and then....Basically a combination of various conspiracy-type sci-fi films (e.g. HANGAR 18, CAPRICORN ONE) , legitimate sci-fi (2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY; ALIEN), docudrama (APOLLO 13), and ""found horror footage"" (THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT), APOLLO 18  was largely financed by the very independent brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein for what was an extremely paltry amount, $5 million.  Given its attempts at BLAIR WITCH-style tactics (shaky cameras; grainy video; strobe lights) and working with technology that existed back in the mid-1970s, the makers of APOLLO 18 have sought to exploit that market of so-called ""found film"" footage that popped up after BLAIR WITCH's sudden and huge success in 1999.  The finished product has many of the same flaws and high points of BLAIR WITCH; the acting by the three principal actors cannot be expected to be on the level of Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, or Bill Paxton in APOLLO 13.  And it certainly has too many credibility gaps to either be as enlightening as ""2001"" or as scary as ALIEN, though, strangely, the brief moments when the lethal crab-like creatures do appear in person (mostly, they are implied) give off a shock factor not far removed from THE BIRDS or JAWS, which is far better than most horror films of recent vintage have managed to do.Not surprisingly, both NASA and the Pentagon disavowed giving the makers of APOLLO 18 any help in its making, and it's just as well.  This movie is no masterpiece by any reasonable definition of the term, even given a budget that, by today's sci-fi standards, is very low indeed.  As an experiment in combining conspiracy theories, pseudo-documentary techniques, legitimate sci-fi, and horror, however, it does succeed in certain ways that very few others of its type ever dreamed of.",4,"No Masterpiece (To Say The Least), But Good Enough For What It Is",1315440000,"09 8, 2011",2011,3567,"['Suppose', 'following', 'official', 'final', 'lunar', 'mission', 'Apollo', '17', 'December', '1972', 'once-aborted', 'Apollo', '18', 'mission', 'had', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'Pentagon', 'sent', 'Moon', 'highly', 'secret', 'mission', 'premise', '2011', 'film', 'APOLLO', '18', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'conspiracy', 'tract', 'also', 'something', 'outer-space', 'shocker', 'la', '1979', 'blockbuster', 'ALIEN.The', 'premise', 'pseudo-documentary', 'sci-fi', 'enterprise', 'cloak', 'secrecy', 'so', 'great', 'apparently', 'not', 'even', 'same', 'American', 'media', 'uncovered', 'truth', 'Watergate', 'knows', 'Department', 'Defense', 'sent', 'three-man', 'crew', 'Moon', 'Apollo', '18', 'December', '1974', 'errand', 'crew', 'clearly', 'knew', 'nothing', 'beforehand', 'Everything', 'go', 'well', 'first', 'two', 'men', 'Warren', 'Christie', 'Lloyd', 'Owen', 'who', 'land', 'Moon', 'lunar', 'module', 'Liberty', 'make', 'landing', 'as', 'routine', 'anything', 'saw', 'real', 'Apollo', 'program', 'exception', 'course', 'Apollo', '13', 'mission', '1970', 'almost', 'took', 'fatal', 'turn', 'once', 'get', 'there', 'discover', 'what', 'would', 'appear', 'be', 'actual', 'Russian', 'lunar', 'module', 'mere', 'three', 'miles', 'landing', 'site', 'when', 'enter', 'module', 'see', 'interior', 'shambles', 'blood', 'control', 'panels', 'couple', 'very', 'dead', 'Russian', 'cosmonauts', 'Even', 'more', 'Own', 'Christie', 'discover', 'tracks', 'made', 'Moon', 'surface', 'are', 'theirs', 'cosmonauts', 'indicating', 'course', 'extra-terrestrial', 'life', 'premise', 'lot', 'scientific', 'credibility', 'least', 'actual', 'Apollo', 'missions', 'evidence', 'such', 'thing', 'was', 'ever', 'found', 'Moon', 'airless', 'surface', 'then', 'extra-terrestrial', 'creatures', 'look', 'mini-crabs', 'appear', 'lunar', 'rocks', 'then', '.Basically', 'combination', 'various', 'conspiracy-type', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'e.g', 'HANGAR', '18', 'CAPRICORN', 'ONE', 'legitimate', 'sci-fi', '2001', 'SPACE', 'ODYSSEY', 'ALIEN', 'docudrama', 'APOLLO', '13', 'found', 'horror', 'footage', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'APOLLO', '18', 'was', 'largely', 'financed', 'very', 'independent', 'brothers', 'Harvey', 'Bob', 'Weinstein', 'what', 'was', 'extremely', 'paltry', 'amount', '5', 'million', 'Given', 'attempts', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH-style', 'tactics', 'shaky', 'cameras', 'grainy', 'video', 'lights', 'working', 'technology', 'existed', 'back', 'mid-1970s', 'makers', 'APOLLO', '18', 'have', 'sought', 'exploit', 'market', 'so-called', 'found', 'film', 'footage', 'popped', 'up', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'sudden', 'huge', 'success', '1999', 'finished', 'product', 'many', 'same', 'flaws', 'high', 'points', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'acting', 'three', 'principal', 'actors', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'expected', 'be', 'level', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'APOLLO', '13', 'certainly', 'too', 'many', 'credibility', 'gaps', 'either', 'be', 'as', 'enlightening', '2001', 'as', 'scary', 'ALIEN', 'though', 'strangely', 'brief', 'moments', 'when', 'lethal', 'crab-like', 'creatures', 'do', 'appear', 'person', 'mostly', 'are', 'implied', 'give', 'off', 'shock', 'factor', 'not', 'far', 'removed', 'THE', 'BIRDS', 'JAWS', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'recent', 'vintage', 'have', 'managed', 'do.Not', 'surprisingly', 'NASA', 'Pentagon', 'disavowed', 'giving', 'makers', 'APOLLO', '18', 'help', 'making', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'masterpiece', 'reasonable', 'definition', 'term', 'even', 'given', 'budget', 'today', 'sci-fi', 'standards', 'very', 'low', 'indeed', 'experiment', 'combining', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'pseudo-documentary', 'techniques', 'legitimate', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'however', 'succeed', 'certain', 'ways', 'very', 'few', 'others', 'type', 'ever', 'dreamed']",Apollo 18

Thankfully however, ""Apollo 18"" manages to distinguish itself enough to stand on it's own legs, and deliver a satisfying experience.""Apollo 18"" follows the tale of the final, top-secret mission to the moon.  Assembled from top-secret footage taken during the mission itself, we follow the three astronauts as they head to the moon to put up several audio recorders, so the good old US of A can get an edge on those pesky commies in Russia.  However, shortly after landing, they make a shocking discovery and realize that their mission has become incredibly dangerous.There's a lot that can't be said about ""Apollo 18"" without giving away some nice surprises, but I can say this:  ""Apollo 18"" has the advantage of multiple camera angles and intimacy going for it.  Unlike similar films, the action here is filmed from multiple angles (mounted cameras in the spaceship, hand held, cameras on suits, etc.), so that we constantly have new things to look at, rather then shaky footage shot from a single camera.  I also really enjoyed the sense of loneliness that the movie creates:  We never leave the three astronauts, and as the film goes on, the tension and dread really build, and culminates in a very memorable climax.For all that it gets right, there are a few areas where ""Apollo 18"" stumbles:  For one thing, it's not all that scary.  Creepy yes, and with a great atmosphere of dread, but there are few outright scares (though the scenes with a strobe light are REALLY well done).  The main characters also are fairly generic (the all around nice guy, the chipper pilot, the determined commander), but because there are only three of them, we're still interested in what happens to them, so that can be forgiven.All in all, ""Apollo 18"" manages to carve it's own unique identity in the found footage genre.  Despite the lack of genuine terror, it's sense of isolation and dread goes a long way to creating a very effective atmosphere.

George Lucas acheived a very similar effect with his award winning film 'American Graffiti when he purposely used cheap film stock to duplicate the effect of low budget, drive-in movies of the early sixties. photography in 'Apollo 18' is used to similar effect, and with stunning result.this was a very impressive work of current cinema. unfortunately people these days don't want realism in Sci Fi.

The movie displays the ""found footage.""First and foremost, I hated the filming techniques.  I get what they were attempting, but I wanted to hurt someone when it was finished.  Far too much choppy, shaky, grainy footage that jumped around like the camera was in a 10-foot blender.  The discontinuity between cuts reminded me of a security camera at the mall.  While it added an authentic feel to everything, it also distracted significantly.  The action is never seen.  The movement is cursory.  Then there's the great reveal that barely happened.  Implausible or not, the antagonist of a film needs to eventually be revealed and placed on display.  Otherwise the buildup is all for naught.  Imagine Jaws where all you see is the fin the entire movie.  At a certain point we need to see more than subliminal evil.The positives of this film are minimal.  The actors played the All-American, big man on campus role pretty well.  For NASA cream of the crop they were believable.  Sets were cramped, claustrophobic, and space-age, exactly what a space neophyte expects.  It's clear that the hall pass given by NASA was liberally used to cull source material for realistic set pieces and ideas.  A few jump scares are thrown in, but the timing may as well have been on a zoetrope they were so predictable.  Beyond that, there isn't much to like.The morose ending not only fills conspiracy theorists tin foil caps, but leaves a massive plot-hole that needs a backhoe to cover up.

1401977,APZC5PRJVM0PY,B004EPYZXK,JD,"[16, 25]","SPOILER ALERT - SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW (you have been warned)I really wanted to like this movie.  I like sci-fi and I like the occasional scary movie so even seeing that it was not getting good press I decided to chance it.First off, this is one of those shaky-cam films and that just isn't a good gimmick.  The premise is that this is recovered footage, blah blah blah, but it is just a film style that is unpleasant for me, even when it is done well (and this is not well done).  There is a lot of blurred video that cuts abruptly and makes it hard to watch.  In addition, the audio doesn't match what you are seeing.  Sure, when someone talks the audio syncs up perfectly, but other times the audio track carries on and on all the time with radio messages while the videos are cutting and jumping all over the place.  If the video is cutting then the audio should as well.  And it does cut (complete with ear-numbing pops, squeals and blasts of static) but it doesn't do it at the same time the video does.  So not only is it shaky cam but the audio doesn't help matters any.  It is not a long movie but it is tiring to watch.The movie starts out well enough and builds up the tension steadily but then near the end it just jumps into fast forward and ten minutes later you are done.  Watching it feels like a lot of work for very little payoff.  Almost as if they spent all their energy just setting up the introduction and then just slammed out an ending as soon as they could.The ending (and really the whole plot) is just not that good.  This is one of those movies that gives you only a brief glimpse of menace and then never really has it materialize into something you can understand or appreciate.  It felt almost like they understood how implausible it all was and so they didn't offer you anything substantial as a way to avoid having you tear holes into it - and boy, you can really tear holes in this movie.The whole premise (SPOILERS!!!) is that certain rocks on the moon ""feel odd"" and then sprout legs and attack you when you are about to escape.  The Department of Defense, with an unspecified level of help from the Russians, know something is up there killing cosmonauts and so someone at NASA or DOD or something figures they should send some more fresh meat up there without giving them any warning and only the most basic of instructions (""hey you, set up these motion cameras in case some Russians happen to walk in front of them"").  Not sure what the goal there would be because if they knew there was something up there it would seem like they would want to have a well-informed and well-trained crew to get the most info possible but then you wouldn't have an Apollo 18 movie so...",1,Not a good movie,1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,2706,"['SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'SPOILERS', 'MAY', 'FOLLOW', 'have', 'been', 'warned', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'sci-fi', 'like', 'occasional', 'scary', 'movie', 'so', 'even', 'seeing', 'was', 'not', 'getting', 'good', 'press', 'decided', 'chance', 'it.First', 'off', 'one', 'shaky-cam', 'films', 'just', ""n't"", 'good', 'gimmick', 'premise', 'recovered', 'footage', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'just', 'film', 'style', 'unpleasant', 'even', 'when', 'done', 'well', 'not', 'well', 'done', 'lot', 'blurred', 'video', 'abruptly', 'hard', 'watch', 'addition', 'audio', ""n't"", 'match', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'Sure', 'when', 'someone', 'audio', 'syncs', 'up', 'perfectly', 'other', 'times', 'audio', 'track', 'time', 'radio', 'messages', 'videos', 'are', 'cutting', 'jumping', 'place', 'video', 'cutting', 'then', 'audio', 'should', 'as', 'well', 'cut', 'complete', 'ear-numbing', 'pops', 'squeals', 'blasts', 'static', ""n't"", 'do', 'same', 'time', 'video', 'So', 'not', 'only', 'shaky', 'cam', 'audio', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'not', 'long', 'movie', 'tiring', 'watch.The', 'movie', 'out', 'well', 'enough', 'up', 'tension', 'steadily', 'then', 'end', 'just', 'fast', 'forward', 'ten', 'minutes', 'later', 'are', 'done', 'Watching', 'lot', 'work', 'very', 'little', 'payoff', 'spent', 'energy', 'just', 'setting', 'up', 'introduction', 'then', 'just', 'slammed', 'out', 'ending', 'as', 'soon', 'could.The', 'ending', 'really', 'whole', 'plot', 'just', 'not', 'that', 'good', 'one', 'movies', 'only', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'menace', 'then', 'never', 'really', 'materialize', 'something', 'can', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'felt', 'almost', 'understood', 'how', 'implausible', 'was', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'offer', 'anything', 'substantial', 'way', 'avoid', 'having', 'tear', 'holes', 'boy', 'can', 'really', 'tear', 'holes', 'movie.The', 'whole', 'premise', 'SPOILERS', 'certain', 'rocks', 'moon', 'feel', 'odd', 'then', 'sprout', 'legs', 'attack', 'when', 'are', 'escape', 'Department', 'Defense', 'unspecified', 'level', 'help', 'Russians', 'know', 'something', 'there', 'killing', 'cosmonauts', 'so', 'someone', 'NASA', 'DOD', 'something', 'figures', 'should', 'send', 'more', 'fresh', 'meat', 'there', 'giving', 'warning', 'only', 'most', 'basic', 'instructions', 'hey', 'set', 'up', 'motion', 'cameras', 'case', 'Russians', 'happen', 'walk', 'front', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'goal', 'would', 'be', 'knew', 'was', 'something', 'up', 'would', 'seem', 'would', 'want', 'have', 'well-informed', 'well-trained', 'crew', 'get', 'most', 'info', 'possible', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'Apollo', '18', 'movie', 'so']",Apollo 18

However, upon closer inspection, the lone Russian cosmonaut is discovered in a cave some distance from his lunar module.  He is not alive.  What begins next is a struggle for survival for the Americans as they are forced to deal with strange alien beings who menace their ship and begin to infect the astronauts themselves.

In Apollo 18 we learn that NASA and the Department of Defense sent a secret manned mission to the moon in 1974 in order to install a device to spy on Russian communications. The men were outfitted with Kodachrome hand-held cameras in order to document the mission. They never made it back to Earth. A space conspiracy website called &#8220;The Lunar Truth&#8221; somehow obtained 84 hours of footage from this mission and edited it down to 90 minutes before uploading it onto their website. Apollo 18 is a found footage movie detailing the fate of the astronauts.I love stories that take place in isolated settings and the surface of the moon is about as isolated as you can get. Apollo 18 is yet another &#8220;found footage&#8221; tale and a fairly effective one at that. The isolation of the moon combined with the claustrophobic interior of the space capsule heightens the tension once otherworldly dangers are encountered. Apollo 18 takes a while to get going and in the interim we watch the 3 astronauts go through the machinations of their job while exchanging stilted conversation about their lives back on Earth. The scares are mostly of the things-that-go-bump-in-the-night variety but they work well here. The final 10 minutes are especially tense/gripping. The found &#8220;footage&#8221; looks terrific and matches the look of real moon landing footage that we have seen all of our lives.

The answer, if I understood one of the alternate endings, is that the astronaut in the command module did manage to return, although the theatrical ending makes this anything but clear.Finally I must commend the makers of the DVD for including a full complement of bonus features, including deleted scenes, alternate endings, and director's commentary.So if you like ""Bugs in Space"" movies, you may enjoy this minor effort, which is certainly worth a rental if not perhaps a purchase.",3,Bugs in Space,1325635200,"01 4, 2012",2012,902,"['Apollo', '18', 'budget', 'version', 'Alien', 'done', 'found', 'footage', 'style.If', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'movies', 'featuring', 'creepy', 'crawlers', 'space', ""'ll"", 'find', 'tense', 'entertaining', 'not', 'thrilling', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'not', 'much', 'new', 'here', 'either.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'raised', 'question', 'how', 'footage', 'space', 'mission', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'none', 'three', 'astronauts', 'returned', 'earth', 'answer', 'understood', 'one', 'alternate', 'endings', 'astronaut', 'command', 'module', 'did', 'manage', 'return', 'theatrical', 'ending', 'anything', 'clear.Finally', 'must', 'commend', 'makers', 'DVD', 'including', 'full', 'complement', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'endings', 'director', 'commentary.So', 'like', 'Bugs', 'Space', 'movies', 'may', 'enjoy', 'minor', 'effort', 'certainly', 'worth', 'rental', 'not', 'perhaps', 'purchase']",Apollo 18

As a result I was eager to see the movie, so about a week ago I rented it from the local Redbox.  It was barely worth the $1.20 it cost to rent.Other reviewers here have gotten more into the technical aspects of the movie, so I don't feel the need to re-hash what has already been said. See, for instance, Ian's ""Houston, we have a REALLY big problem"" review of 9-2-2011. While I agree with his assessment of the mechanics of the movie, I disagree with his overall recommendation of it. Here's why:First, the movie is only 1-1/4 hours long, so it draws to a close before you even know it.  The shortness is only intensified by the fact that the first 20 minutes of the movie are spent showing you what is made to look like archival footage from NASA.  So yeah, you get to see some astronauts, Mission Control, etc.  In my estimation, those 20 minutes effectively did little more than serve as filler--which tells you how anemic the movie actually is.  So when you factor out those essentially pointless 20 minutes, you're left with a film that is really less than an hour long.  This is not much time to develop anything of substance.Second, the movie just isn't scary. It's moderately suspenseful at times, but that's as hair-raising as it gets.  If the whole point of a horror movie is to generate...well, horror and fear...then what's the use of producing a horror movie that fails to deliver on its primary purpose?Third, I found the movie predictable at certain crucial moments.  I don't want to spoil it by offering specifics, but if the viewer can see some of the important plot twists or developments coming down the pike, it certainly lessens the experience and mimimizes the scare or suspense value.So despite the reviewers who give this movie three or more stars, I would HIGHLY recommend to the potential buyer that you RENT IT first.

NASA did some Apollo missions to the moon, most notably Apollo 11 and 13, others were canceled due to budget reasons and the last official Apollo mission was 17 done in 1972. According to this film though there was a secret mission in 1974 where a couple of astronauts went up to the moon thanks to the U.S. Dept. of Defense's money and they go to the south side of the moon.Of course according to the makers this is actual NASA footage uncovered in 2011 and shows the reason we've never gone back to the crater filled moon over our planet. After landing they goof around a bit on the surface then weird things start to happen, like scary noises, odd shadows and shapes appearing out of the corner of their eye and the typical horror cliches as both guys freak out as they are by themselves against an unknown terror.This movie is not what I would call an artistic success, due to the PG-13 rating there's a lot of cuts from anything reasonably scary, most of the time the camera goes all static or blank when something terrifying is supposed to be occuring.

1401991,AHR9GFUXXEHY0,B004EPYZXK,Jon Thompson,"[1, 2]","Technically there's really nothing all that wrong with this film. It uses the ""found footage"" format (crudely shot amateur video from a single limited point of view as if someone captured it on a home movie camera), which is fine and in this case fits the overall intent of the story.Nothing much wrong with the acting either. In fact the performances are quite passable.The visuals and effects work okay as well. Nothing too spectacular was required but what there is works just fine.The problem isn't even with the story itself, though there's nothing really new here. An Apollo crew goes on a secret mission to the moon and encounters alien creatures.What sinks the entire enterprise is the overall of the project. It is unrelentingly grim, certainly not the sort of thing you want to watch for entertainment.You get the feeling it is something rather dark and unpleasant just by looking at the poster. A previously unknown Apollo moon mission that you've never heard about before which, logic tells you, must have been lost with all hands. That's kind of depressing to consider and it's what you realize just from the poster.Not that it couldn't have been a tragedy, like one of the Shakespeare plays were everyone dies in the end, like Romeo & Juliet or Hamlet. Both of those are great works, full of engaging thoughts and idea.But what's missing in Apollo 18 is any sense of heroism or transcendant sacrifice. Basically it's a trio of ordinary guys who got lied to by those they work for (NASA, the US government) and callously sent to their deaths in the interests of... well, we never find out why (another problem). Mostly what we get is three guys in a tight spot struggling to stay alive, even though we already know they are all going to die in the end.And they do exactly what real people in such circumstances would do... panic, rage, totally freak out, try anything they can think of to survive. None of them have any kind of epiphany about the need to sacrifice themselves, none of them do anything particularly noble. They're just a trio of already doomed guys wasting their time and effort trying to stay alive. That's not what I would call entertainment. You get about the same feeling you would if you stabbed an animal in the gut and then just watched it suffer and slowly bleed to death.I could consider it an unsuccessful attempt to do what others managed to pull off in the original Director's cut of ""Butterfly Effect"". For the theatrical release of that one the studio required the filmmakers to tack on a silly ""happy ending"" which totally negated the entire rest of the story. In the original cut, the lead character dies. But he does so willingly because he understands he must to help or save others, which elevates it to a kind of heroic, nobel self-sacrifice. True, it's also pretty grim to watch but there is a feeling of something transcendant going on (despite how unpleasant the outcome is.) In the case of Apollo 18 there's no such ""moral"" or ""point"" to things.If you really want to get the major feeling raised by this movie, watch the TV news for the next story about a bunch of miners trapped alive in a collapsed tunnel, where they make it plain there's no way they're going to ever be rescued. It feels a lot like that. And the miners would be a lot easier on your wallet, being TV news and thus free.",2,"Good idea, bad idea, bland idea",1330387200,"02 28, 2012",2012,3343,"['Technically', 'really', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'film', 'found', 'footage', 'format', 'crudely', 'shot', 'amateur', 'video', 'single', 'limited', 'point', 'view', 'someone', 'captured', 'home', 'movie', 'camera', 'fine', 'case', 'overall', 'intent', 'story.Nothing', 'much', 'wrong', 'acting', 'fact', 'performances', 'are', 'quite', 'passable.The', 'visuals', 'effects', 'work', 'okay', 'as', 'well', 'Nothing', 'too', 'spectacular', 'was', 'required', 'what', 'works', 'just', 'fine.The', 'problem', ""n't"", 'even', 'story', 'nothing', 'really', 'new', 'here', 'Apollo', 'crew', 'secret', 'mission', 'moon', 'encounters', 'alien', 'creatures.What', 'entire', 'enterprise', 'overall', 'project', 'unrelentingly', 'grim', 'certainly', 'not', 'sort', 'thing', 'want', 'watch', 'entertainment.You', 'get', 'feeling', 'something', 'rather', 'dark', 'unpleasant', 'just', 'looking', 'poster', 'previously', 'unknown', 'Apollo', 'moon', 'mission', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'tells', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'hands', 'kind', 'depressing', 'consider', 'what', 'realize', 'just', 'poster.Not', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'tragedy', 'one', 'Shakespeare', 'plays', 'were', 'everyone', 'dies', 'end', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Hamlet', 'are', 'great', 'works', 'full', 'engaging', 'thoughts', 'idea.But', 'what', 'missing', 'Apollo', '18', 'sense', 'heroism', 'transcendant', 'sacrifice', 'Basically', 'trio', 'ordinary', 'guys', 'who', 'got', 'lied', 'work', 'NASA', 'US', 'government', 'callously', 'sent', 'deaths', 'interests', 'well', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'problem', 'Mostly', 'what', 'get', 'three', 'guys', 'tight', 'spot', 'struggling', 'stay', 'alive', 'even', 'already', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'die', 'end.And', 'do', 'exactly', 'what', 'real', 'people', 'such', 'circumstances', 'would', 'do', 'panic', 'rage', 'totally', 'freak', 'out', 'try', 'anything', 'can', 'think', 'survive', 'None', 'have', 'kind', 'epiphany', 'need', 'sacrifice', 'none', 'do', 'anything', 'particularly', 'noble', ""'re"", 'just', 'trio', 'already', 'doomed', 'guys', 'wasting', 'time', 'effort', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'entertainment', 'get', 'same', 'feeling', 'would', 'stabbed', 'animal', 'gut', 'then', 'just', 'watched', 'suffer', 'slowly', 'bleed', 'death.I', 'could', 'consider', 'unsuccessful', 'attempt', 'do', 'what', 'others', 'managed', 'pull', 'off', 'original', 'Director', 'cut', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'theatrical', 'release', 'one', 'studio', 'required', 'filmmakers', 'tack', 'silly', 'happy', 'ending', 'totally', 'negated', 'entire', 'rest', 'story', 'original', 'cut', 'lead', 'character', 'dies', 'so', 'willingly', 'must', 'help', 'save', 'others', 'kind', 'heroic', 'nobel', 'self-sacrifice', 'True', 'also', 'pretty', 'grim', 'watch', 'feeling', 'something', 'transcendant', 'going', 'how', 'unpleasant', 'outcome', 'case', 'Apollo', '18', 'such', 'moral', 'point', 'things.If', 'really', 'want', 'get', 'major', 'feeling', 'raised', 'movie', 'watch', 'TV', 'news', 'next', 'story', 'bunch', 'miners', 'trapped', 'alive', 'collapsed', 'tunnel', 'where', 'make', 'plain', 'way', ""'re"", 'going', 'ever', 'be', 'rescued', 'lot', 'miners', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'easier', 'wallet', 'being', 'TV', 'news', 'thus', 'free']",Apollo 18

1401997,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004EPYZXK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Utilizing the increasingly popular ""found footage"" genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation, ""Apollo 18"" takes an interesting story and serves up exactly what you might expect. That is both a compliment and a criticism. Neither particularly good or bad, this is a film with limited ambition or originality--but it still works rather effectively if you've got nothing better lined up for entertainment. I watched this with a friend, and when the movie ended--he turned to me and said ""well, that was just what I thought it would be."" It's not that either of us hated the film--far from it--we simply thought it lacked any real element of surprise. It's reasonably well made, the actors are appealing enough (if not explored in much depth), and the effects are solid. It just lacks impact from a plotting standpoint.The film gives us a cursory introduction to the three astronauts who will be journeying to the moon on Apollo 18. In flight, they banter mildly--but things get more serious when they arrive at their destination. The two men who go to the surface start to experience unsettling hallucinogenic dreams. Were they exposed to a strange mineral? Or might there be some other life form wrecking havoc with their lucidity. Battling darkness, the unknown, and constant communication problems--the men soon realize that they may well be in jeopardy. Again, nothing comes as a particular surprise to the viewer so the execution of the plot is key. The actors do well in increasingly panicked performances, but there is little to distinguish this from countless other pictures. All plays out precisely as you know it will.Don't expect complicated explanations or any type of developed mythology--everything must just be accepted at face value. Clocking in at just under ninety minutes, the movie is easy enough to watch with a minimum of commitment. I certainly enjoyed aspects of the film, but it's nothing that I'd go out of my way to watch again. But if you like the genre, you might give this a try. But be warned. If you've seen the trailer or the advertisements, you absolutely know what to expect--so don't set your sights much higher!

Which live in space but can function just fine in an atmosphere, and which happen to be able to eat humans?  What do they normally live on and how is it they can digest us, when they aren't native to our planet?  Also the military sent astronauts there but then refused to let them return with the organisms they were presumably sent to bring back?  I don't get it.  (Maybe they were trying to avoid getting too close to the premise in ""Aliens"".)  Also, the idea of these space beasties attacking astronauts on the Moon was reminiscent of the movie Red Planet, almost like the idea was borrowed from there.That said, the producers obviously did their homework.  The moonwalks etc. look very realistic (though the guys do seem to be walking in Earth gravity from time to time).  The Soviet lander was right, which is impressive since it's pretty obscure, and it was indeed a one-man lander and was called the LK.  The fact that the astronauts identified it as an ""LK-Proton"" is curious (since the Proton is a rocket, not a spacecraft), but it would be understandable that a 1970s astronaut wouldn't have all the terminology right since the Soviet lunar program was top secret.  A Soviet lunar landing, had one actually happened, probably would have been lifted on Proton rockets (since the N1 Moon rocket was a failure)--also, the Soviets' unmanned lunar flyby tests were lifted on Protons.I would really like to give this 2.5 stars, because it's so well-done technically; too bad half stars aren't available.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Dimension Films head Bob Weinstein ""balked at the idea"" that the film was a work of fiction, stating that ""We didn't shoot anything; we found it. Found, baby!"" The production comes across as very amateur as a result which is hard to swallow because most of us don't bring handheld cameras to the moon. The Blair Witch Project is more convincing because the low-budget props and acting worked in the forest but doesn't work in space. When I saw Blair Witch I could deal with the premise because that movie doesn't ask the audience for too much but it is so obvious that this is not the ""lost footage"" from the Apollo 18 mission in 1974 that the whole idea comes across as cheesy. Even Paranormal Activity seems more ""real"" and offers some decent jump scares. This film is suspense-free and not scary at all. The props look like Radio Shack quality. It is apparent the actors are pushing buttons on a children's toy when it is supposed to be a computer worthy of a space flight (however antiquated the technology might seem to us now). The filmmakers tried to capitalize on the theme, popularity and dialogue from the excellent Apollo 13. If I hear, ""the LEM, the LEM, we have to get back to the LEM"" one more time I will scream in a place no one can hear me. Admittedly, the Blu-ray picture and audio quality are fairly good.

It seems however, that some conspiracy theory passionates found ""lost footage"" filmed during this mission - the film is supposed to be a kind of ""you tube"" viewing of those miraculously recovered tapes...Three astronauts were send to the Moon in ""Apollo 18"", which officially was an unmanned probe - it was necessary to invent this cover story to deceive the public, as it is a little bit hard to conceal the take-off of a Saturn V giant rocket from Cape Canaveral... Commander Nathan Walker and Captain Ben Walker were supposed to land on the Moon and deploy some special electronic captors for the Department of Defense (the official reason why this mission is so secret) - Lieutenant-Colonel John Grey was supposed to stay in the orbiter and wait for the return (the same procedure as in real lunar manned mission).Well, as you can see on the cover, at least one of them will land on Moon and he will have a great number of reasons to regret it... No more spoilers here.Now, visually this film is a very good thing - the ""lost footage"" seems really like something that could really have been taken during a genuine lunar mission. Spaceships interiors and lunar landscape were well done, no argument there. Actors were unknown to me, but they did a good job. Sound editing was particularly well done and acoustics play an important role in this film - freaky interferences which plague radio communications during most of the film were really well thought and conceived.However, I must say that I didn't care for most of the scenario. Some limited SPOILERS here. Really, people, would it really hurt that in at least one SF film people who are send on a mission are actually briefed about the REAL reasons for their mission? Virtually everything that happens past the first 30 minutes is such a ""clich&eacute;"", that we can anticipate EVERY single development until the final credits... It is amazing, how one can combine a rather original initial idea (a secret lunar mission) with every and each one of the un-original, stereotyped, saw-it-all-one-thousand-times-before, yawn+fastforward tricks.Some reviewers didn't like the general scientific idea behind the scenario, but I for one rather appreciated it. Possible HUGE SPOILER ahead: if you are concerned about the scientific realism of this film, please go on the internet and look up the very real living creatures called ""tardigrades"", most complex of all currently known polyextremophiles... But if you didn't see this film yet, you may want to postpone this research for after the viewing. However, once again, the excellent initial idea of hasards lurking on the Moon was wasted by the following accumulation of all possible and imaginable ""clich&eacute;s"".So bottom line, I personally found this film OK, but somehow disappointing. But one can not deny it some originality in the general ideas and the visual and acoustic aspects are pretty well done indeed. Therefore, if you are into SF and/or horrors, you are encouraged to see it and make up your own mind. Otherwise do not bother. In any case I will not keep this DVD for any future viewings.",3,"""Blair Witch Project"" goes to the Moon to capture nice imagery and sounds - but the scenario sucks as bad as space vacuum...",1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,3516,"['had', 'very', 'mixt', 'feelings', 'when', 'finished', 'watching', 'film', 'rate', 'three', 'stars', 'OK', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'enough', 'hate', 'also', 'certainly', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'liked', 'Below', 'more', 'impressions', 'limited', 'SPOILERS.As', 'learn', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'story', 'Apollo', '18', 'lunar', 'mission', 'officially', 'never', 'took', 'place', 'however', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'found', 'lost', 'footage', 'filmed', 'mission', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'kind', 'tube', 'viewing', 'miraculously', 'recovered', 'tapes', 'Three', 'astronauts', 'were', 'send', 'Moon', 'Apollo', '18', 'officially', 'was', 'unmanned', 'probe', 'was', 'necessary', 'invent', 'cover', 'story', 'deceive', 'public', 'little', 'bit', 'hard', 'conceal', 'take-off', 'Saturn', 'V', 'giant', 'rocket', 'Cape', 'Canaveral', 'Commander', 'Nathan', 'Walker', 'Captain', 'Ben', 'Walker', 'were', 'supposed', 'land', 'Moon', 'deploy', 'special', 'electronic', 'captors', 'Department', 'Defense', 'official', 'reason', 'why', 'mission', 'so', 'secret', 'Lieutenant-Colonel', 'John', 'Grey', 'was', 'supposed', 'stay', 'orbiter', 'wait', 'return', 'same', 'procedure', 'real', 'lunar', 'manned', 'mission', '.Well', 'can', 'see', 'cover', 'least', 'one', 'will', 'land', 'Moon', 'will', 'have', 'great', 'number', 'reasons', 'regret', 'No', 'more', 'spoilers', 'here.Now', 'visually', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'lost', 'footage', 'really', 'like', 'something', 'could', 'really', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'genuine', 'lunar', 'mission', 'Spaceships', 'interiors', 'lunar', 'landscape', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'argument', 'there', 'Actors', 'were', 'unknown', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Sound', 'editing', 'was', 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'acoustics', 'play', 'important', 'role', 'film', 'freaky', 'interferences', 'plague', 'radio', 'communications', 'most', 'film', 'were', 'really', 'well', 'thought', 'conceived.However', 'must', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'most', 'scenario', 'limited', 'SPOILERS', 'here', 'Really', 'people', 'would', 'really', 'hurt', 'least', 'one', 'SF', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'send', 'mission', 'are', 'actually', 'briefed', 'REAL', 'reasons', 'mission', 'Virtually', 'everything', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'such', 'clich', 'eacute', 'can', 'anticipate', 'EVERY', 'single', 'development', 'final', 'credits', 'amazing', 'how', 'one', 'can', 'combine', 'rather', 'original', 'initial', 'idea', 'secret', 'lunar', 'mission', 'one', 'un-original', 'stereotyped', 'saw-it-all-one-thousand-times-before', 'yawn+fastforward', 'tricks.Some', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'general', 'scientific', 'idea', 'scenario', 'one', 'rather', 'appreciated', 'Possible', 'HUGE', 'SPOILER', 'ahead', 'are', 'concerned', 'scientific', 'realism', 'film', 'please', 'go', 'internet', 'look', 'up', 'very', 'real', 'living', 'creatures', 'called', 'tardigrades', 'most', 'complex', 'currently', 'known', 'polyextremophiles', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'yet', 'may', 'want', 'postpone', 'research', 'viewing', 'However', 'once', 'again', 'excellent', 'initial', 'idea', 'hasards', 'lurking', 'Moon', 'was', 'wasted', 'following', 'accumulation', 'possible', 'imaginable', 'clich', 'eacute', '.So', 'bottom', 'line', 'personally', 'found', 'film', 'OK', 'somehow', 'disappointing', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'originality', 'general', 'ideas', 'visual', 'acoustic', 'aspects', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'indeed', 'Therefore', 'are', 'SF', 'and/or', 'horrors', 'are', 'encouraged', 'see', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'Otherwise', 'do', 'not', 'bother', 'case', 'will', 'not', 'keep', 'DVD', 'future', 'viewings']",Apollo 18
1402009,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B004EPYZXK,magellan,"[37, 54]","I have been reviewing on Amazon for 13 years, have posted almost 1600 reviews, including those for several hundred movies, am a former Top 50 reviewer (under the original ranking system, not the new one, which rates you higher the more positive votes you get, and so discourages more objective and especially justifiably negative reviews), and this is one of the few times I've ever given anything a one-star review.First of all, I admit to being easily entertained when it comes to movies and am not that critical of them usually, and if a movie has ANYTHING going for it at all I usually rate it three stars. To earn a two-star or one-star rating from me a movie really has to be almost incredibly bad with practically no redeeming qualities at all.Unfortunately I have to admit that this movie manages that in spades. If the movie was actually worth watching, the shaky, jerky, amateurish camera work a la the ""Blair Witch Project"" and other similar ""found footage"" movies might have been forgivable, but in this case just manages to make the increasingly implausible and nonsensical plot and story line even more annoying to watch.&lt;&lt;Spoiler alert!!!>>Three astronauts are sent to the moon on a dangerous secret mission without being told by the DOD what they're up against. This makes no sense at all. We know this since the deputy director of defense admits they understood the situation and what happened to the Russian astronauts before the American astronauts arrived.As time goes on (at least the movie does a decent job of building up the suspense, I'll give it that much) the threat is eventually revealed to be a bizarre new life form that looks like ordinary moon rocks--except that they can suddenly sprout legs, climb into your space suit, and eat your face. Horrors.When the you-know-what hits the proverbial fan (hard to do in an airless environment but this movie manages even that) the director tells the two remaining astronauts that they've been contaminated and that they can't be recovered. Really? Maybe they should have told them the Russian astronauts had encountered a deadly threat so that they could have taken steps to protect themselves in the first place.The desolate Lunar landscape is rendered realistically, though, as well as the interior scenes of the landing module. At least that much came off well. But the movie takes a long time to ramp up and once it gets going--basically in the last 30 minutes--it's almost over. Fortunately.As an homage to the sci-fi and horror genre of the 50s and 60s with its cheesy monsters, bad acting, silly plots, and hokey special effects, this movie might be forgivable, but even ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" manages to be entertaining in its bumbling sort of way, which this movie is not. If you're looking for ""Plan 10 1/2 from Outer Space"" then this movie might be for you. Otherwise commit it to the depths of space from whence hopefully it will never return--or at least, like Haley's Comet--only once every 76 years. ;-(",1,In space no one can hear you yawn...,1325289600,"12 31, 2011",2011,3001,"['have', 'been', 'reviewing', 'Amazon', '13', 'years', 'have', 'posted', 'almost', '1600', 'reviews', 'including', 'several', 'hundred', 'movies', 'am', 'former', 'Top', '50', 'reviewer', 'original', 'ranking', 'system', 'not', 'new', 'one', 'rates', 'higher', 'more', 'positive', 'votes', 'get', 'so', 'more', 'objective', 'especially', 'justifiably', 'negative', 'reviews', 'one', 'few', 'times', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'given', 'anything', 'one-star', 'review.First', 'admit', 'being', 'easily', 'entertained', 'when', 'movies', 'am', 'not', 'critical', 'usually', 'movie', 'ANYTHING', 'going', 'usually', 'rate', 'three', 'stars', 'earn', 'two-star', 'one-star', 'rating', 'movie', 'really', 'be', 'almost', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'practically', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'all.Unfortunately', 'have', 'admit', 'movie', 'spades', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'worth', 'watching', 'shaky', 'jerky', 'amateurish', 'camera', 'work', 'la', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'other', 'similar', 'found', 'footage', 'movies', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'forgivable', 'case', 'just', 'make', 'increasingly', 'implausible', 'nonsensical', 'plot', 'story', 'line', 'even', 'more', 'annoying', 'watch.', 'lt', 'lt', 'Spoiler', 'alert', '>', '>', 'Three', 'astronauts', 'are', 'sent', 'moon', 'dangerous', 'secret', 'mission', 'being', 'told', 'DOD', 'what', ""'re"", 'up', 'sense', 'know', 'deputy', 'director', 'defense', 'admits', 'understood', 'situation', 'what', 'happened', 'Russian', 'American', 'astronauts', 'arrived.As', 'time', 'least', 'movie', 'decent', 'job', 'building', 'up', 'suspense', ""'ll"", 'give', 'much', 'threat', 'eventually', 'revealed', 'be', 'bizarre', 'new', 'life', 'form', 'ordinary', 'moon', 'rocks', 'can', 'suddenly', 'sprout', 'legs', 'climb', 'space', 'suit', 'eat', 'face', 'Horrors.When', 'you-know-what', 'hits', 'proverbial', 'fan', 'hard', 'do', 'airless', 'environment', 'movie', 'even', 'director', 'two', 'remaining', 'astronauts', ""'ve"", 'been', 'contaminated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'recovered', 'Really', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'told', 'Russian', 'astronauts', 'had', 'encountered', 'deadly', 'threat', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'steps', 'protect', 'first', 'place.The', 'desolate', 'Lunar', 'landscape', 'rendered', 'realistically', 'though', 'as', 'well', 'interior', 'scenes', 'landing', 'module', 'least', 'much', 'came', 'off', 'well', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'ramp', 'up', 'going', 'basically', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'almost', 'Fortunately.As', 'homage', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'genre', '50s', '60s', 'cheesy', 'monsters', 'bad', 'acting', 'silly', 'plots', 'hokey', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'forgivable', 'even', 'Plan', '9', 'Outer', 'Space', 'be', 'entertaining', 'bumbling', 'sort', 'way', 'movie', 'not', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Plan', '10', '1/2', 'Outer', 'Space', 'then', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'Otherwise', 'commit', 'depths', 'space', 'whence', 'hopefully', 'will', 'never', 'return', 'least', 'Haley', 'Comet', 'only', 'once', '76', 'years']",Apollo 18

1402012,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004EPYZXK,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Ever since THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT ""lost footage"" movies have become a genre unto themselves. Some have done well at the box office, some have received no notice and others just exist. Then there are films like APOLLO 18 that use the device well but just sit there.APOLLO 18 is supposed to be comprised of footage that was secreted away after the failed expedition to the moon. So secret was the mission that the blast off was hidden as a mission to launch a satellite rather than a trip to the moon. Even the astronaut's families weren't told they were going to the moon.All goes well at first. The team gets into space without a problem. The two man team landing on the moon's surface have a bit of difficulty but manage to land without a hitch. The moon rover works fine and they collect samples without error. But something goes wrong eventually.The two men on the surface come across another space ship on the moon. This one is Russian and something happened. To begin with, no one knew that this ship was here or even that the Russian's launched a moon expedition. Secondly, the interior of the ship has been trashed. After a bit of searching, the pair follows footsteps that lead them to the dead cosmonaut, his suit ripped and his helmet smashed.Other odd things happen as well. A moon rock supposedly locked away in storage is found in the landing module. The flag they planted disappears. And eventually one of the astronauts comes down with some space disease where he sees things and is wounded.What could have been a film that makes you wonder are they really seeing things or are they hallucinating becomes instead a movie that lets you have glimpses that yes indeed, there are creatures on the moon. These start with things we viewers see in the periphery of the cameras lens, items that are just at the rims of our visibility. Something moves or something falls and while the main characters aren't aware we most certainly are.Eventually the question is posed will NASA try to bring these men back or leave them stranded in space? Will they allow them to die fearing what they might bring back to Earth or will they rescue them?As with another lost footage film, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, this one plays off the spooks of being stranded in a world where you have no control over what's happening around you. Unlike that film it doesn't really scare you or make you jump with the exception of one loud noise that surprises you. Whoopee.Confined to a small cabin and a few feet of the moon's surface, the movie feels cramped and stagnant like the air in the capsule. It doesn't offer enough scares to frighten and doesn't develop the characters enough to make you feel concern for their plight. Sure we see scenes of them with their families at the beginning but since it was more like home movies we don't get enough chance to form a bond with them. In so doing we end up just not caring.At the end of the day APOLLO 18 just doesn't hold up. It never holds your interest enough. The scares just aren't scary. The ""real life footage"" feels repetitive and the items at the edges make you feel more like you're playing Where's Waldo rather than seeing some creature in a space capsule.If you feel the need to see all movies that qualify as horror or all movies that are the ""lost footage"" genre, then you'll want to rent this one. If not there are plenty of other good movies worth renting. Long before the end of this one I could tell that it was one I'd never watch again.",2,MISSION NOT ACCOMPLISHED,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,3481,"['Ever', 'THE', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH', 'PROJECT', 'lost', 'footage', 'movies', 'have', 'become', 'genre', 'unto', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'have', 'received', 'notice', 'others', 'just', 'exist', 'Then', 'are', 'films', 'APOLLO', '18', 'use', 'device', 'well', 'just', 'sit', 'there.APOLLO', '18', 'supposed', 'be', 'comprised', 'footage', 'was', 'secreted', 'away', 'failed', 'expedition', 'moon', 'So', 'secret', 'was', 'mission', 'blast', 'off', 'was', 'hidden', 'mission', 'launch', 'satellite', 'rather', 'trip', 'moon', 'Even', 'astronaut', 'families', 'were', ""n't"", 'told', 'were', 'going', 'moon.All', 'well', 'first', 'team', 'space', 'problem', 'two', 'man', 'team', 'landing', 'moon', 'surface', 'have', 'bit', 'difficulty', 'manage', 'land', 'hitch', 'moon', 'rover', 'fine', 'collect', 'samples', 'error', 'something', 'wrong', 'eventually.The', 'two', 'men', 'surface', 'come', 'space', 'ship', 'moon', 'one', 'Russian', 'something', 'happened', 'begin', 'one', 'knew', 'ship', 'was', 'here', 'even', 'Russian', 'launched', 'moon', 'expedition', 'Secondly', 'interior', 'ship', 'been', 'trashed', 'bit', 'searching', 'pair', 'footsteps', 'lead', 'dead', 'cosmonaut', 'suit', 'ripped', 'helmet', 'smashed.Other', 'odd', 'things', 'happen', 'as', 'well', 'moon', 'rock', 'supposedly', 'locked', 'away', 'storage', 'found', 'landing', 'module', 'flag', 'planted', 'disappears', 'eventually', 'one', 'astronauts', 'down', 'space', 'disease', 'where', 'things', 'wounded.What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'film', 'wonder', 'are', 'really', 'seeing', 'things', 'are', 'hallucinating', 'becomes', 'instead', 'movie', 'have', 'glimpses', 'yes', 'indeed', 'are', 'creatures', 'moon', 'start', 'things', 'viewers', 'see', 'periphery', 'cameras', 'items', 'are', 'just', 'rims', 'visibility', 'Something', 'moves', 'something', 'falls', 'main', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'aware', 'most', 'certainly', 'are.Eventually', 'question', 'posed', 'will', 'NASA', 'try', 'bring', 'men', 'back', 'leave', 'stranded', 'space', 'allow', 'die', 'fearing', 'what', 'might', 'bring', 'back', 'Earth', 'will', 'rescue', 'lost', 'footage', 'film', 'PARANORMAL', 'ACTIVITY', 'one', 'spooks', 'being', 'stranded', 'world', 'where', 'have', 'control', 'what', 'happening', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'scare', 'make', 'jump', 'exception', 'one', 'loud', 'noise', 'Whoopee.Confined', 'small', 'cabin', 'few', 'feet', 'moon', 'surface', 'movie', 'feels', 'cramped', 'stagnant', 'air', 'capsule', ""n't"", 'offer', 'enough', 'scares', 'frighten', ""n't"", 'develop', 'characters', 'enough', 'make', 'feel', 'concern', 'plight', 'Sure', 'see', 'scenes', 'families', 'beginning', 'was', 'more', 'home', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'chance', 'form', 'bond', 'so', 'doing', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'not', 'caring.At', 'end', 'day', 'APOLLO', '18', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'never', 'interest', 'enough', 'scares', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'scary', 'real', 'life', 'footage', 'feels', 'repetitive', 'items', 'edges', 'make', 'feel', 'more', ""'re"", 'playing', 'Where', 'Waldo', 'rather', 'seeing', 'creature', 'space', 'capsule.If', 'feel', 'need', 'see', 'movies', 'qualify', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'lost', 'footage', 'genre', 'then', ""'ll"", 'want', 'rent', 'one', 'not', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'good', 'movies', 'renting', 'Long', 'end', 'one', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'one', ""'d"", 'never', 'watch', 'again']",Apollo 18

Kepler,"[2, 2]","When I saw this on opening day in a theater with about a dozen other people present, I found it to be both not as bad as I had feared, and not as good as I had hoped.  Credit must be given for the cleverness of combining the seemingly exhausted found-footage horror genre, with the realistic historic space exploration genre, while using a significant amount of real archival footage and using mostly period-accurate equipment to capture the new footage.  The result is something that costs very little to make, yet is fairly convincingly real more often than expected.  This is also clever in that it appeals in different ways to the established audiences for found-footage horror, science fiction, docudrama, and conspiracy theory drama audiences.  With just a modest initial weekend draw on each of those special-interest audiences, the film easily made back it's estimated 5 million dollar budget. Two big caveats which may be very specific to a very small population other than myself: I am a sucker for anything Apollo-related, and I don't care that the film was never for even a moment even slightly scary.  I don't go to movies to squeal like a schoolgirl at cheap scare tactics, so I was not disappointed when my pulse remained steady. And after all of that rather jaded criticism, I must say it really was an honest and mostly successful attempt to make an interesting and involving film.  No offense to the director, but this is very much a film created through a combination of many hours of largely improvised performances from good, understated actors, and a very fast-working and creative editing and audio post production team.  The only significant failure of this film was in not conveying any real sense of just how terrifying it must have been for the real Apollo astronauts, even on missions that went mostly by the book.  It is hard to imagine just how absolutely hostile to human life the environment outside of those tiny spacecraft and EVA suits really is.  The unusually lengthy selection of cut, extended, and alternate scenes on this DVD/Blu-Ray release are an enjoyable diversion, giving much insight into the process of making the film.",4,Appeals to several disparate audiences,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",2012,2166,"['When', 'saw', 'opening', 'day', 'theater', 'dozen', 'other', 'people', 'present', 'found', 'be', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'had', 'feared', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'had', 'hoped', 'Credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'cleverness', 'combining', 'seemingly', 'exhausted', 'found-footage', 'horror', 'genre', 'realistic', 'historic', 'space', 'exploration', 'genre', 'using', 'significant', 'amount', 'real', 'archival', 'footage', 'using', 'mostly', 'period-accurate', 'equipment', 'capture', 'new', 'footage', 'result', 'something', 'very', 'little', 'make', 'fairly', 'convincingly', 'real', 'more', 'often', 'expected', 'also', 'clever', 'appeals', 'different', 'ways', 'established', 'audiences', 'found-footage', 'horror', 'science', 'fiction', 'docudrama', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'drama', 'audiences', 'just', 'modest', 'initial', 'weekend', 'draw', 'special-interest', 'audiences', 'film', 'easily', 'made', 'back', 'estimated', '5', 'million', 'dollar', 'budget', 'Two', 'big', 'caveats', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'specific', 'very', 'small', 'population', 'other', 'am', 'sucker', 'anything', 'Apollo-related', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'even', 'moment', 'even', 'slightly', 'scary', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'movies', 'squeal', 'schoolgirl', 'cheap', 'scare', 'tactics', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'when', 'pulse', 'remained', 'steady', 'rather', 'jaded', 'criticism', 'must', 'say', 'really', 'was', 'honest', 'mostly', 'successful', 'attempt', 'make', 'interesting', 'involving', 'film', 'offense', 'director', 'very', 'much', 'film', 'created', 'combination', 'many', 'hours', 'largely', 'improvised', 'performances', 'good', 'understated', 'actors', 'very', 'fast-working', 'creative', 'editing', 'audio', 'post', 'production', 'team', 'only', 'significant', 'failure', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'conveying', 'real', 'sense', 'just', 'how', 'terrifying', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'Apollo', 'astronauts', 'even', 'missions', 'went', 'mostly', 'book', 'hard', 'imagine', 'just', 'how', 'absolutely', 'hostile', 'human', 'life', 'environment', 'tiny', 'spacecraft', 'EVA', 'suits', 'really', 'unusually', 'lengthy', 'selection', 'cut', 'extended', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'DVD/Blu-Ray', 'release', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'diversion', 'giving', 'much', 'insight', 'process', 'making', 'film']",Apollo 18

Also the vast immensity of being alone--the moon has never appeared more desolate and foreboding.  The videography is quite well done---it's claustrophobic but visually creative.  The crab-like creatures aren't shown very much but their sheer presence is ominous and unnerving.

Apollo 18. 3 Astronauts where sent to the moon to plant some sort of spy device... only they discover that may not have been the reason they where sent there after all, especially when they discover something else might be on the moon with them?That may sound interesting, but let me tell you, for most of the movie, you are just bored to death waiting for something to happen as you are treated to annoying sound effects of heavy breathing and what sounds like someone dropping a coin into the porcelain rim of a toilet bowl. What this movie needed was for Jason Voorhees to pop up and say ""...."" and then slaughter these guys 5 mins into the movie and end it right there, but instead you have to sit through the done to death boring scenes where a small shadow or a blurry image show up now and then before you see what is actually happening... which is not worth the wait, it's a stupid idea, and I wish I could just say what it is so you too can hear how lame it sounds, but that would be spoiling the movie for anyone who wants to go against me and check out the film anyway.It must be a pretty boring time for movies if this was the one that sounded the most interesting amongst what is currently a new release.

I was so disappointed to see the concept wasted. So, then when I heard about Apollo 18, I thought someone had resuscitated the idea. Finally I'd get to see a movie maybe close to that first half of a preview which had blown me away...But this is not a good movie. First of all, I hesitate to call it a feature length film. The credits start rolling at 1 hour and 19 minutes. The plot is boring and slow and boring and also boring. It's also boring and it will bore you. Then it will make you bored. There are no surprises. You won't care about any of the characters. There are no interesting visuals or designs. Be careful what posture you watch the film in.

When the director of the film is a non-American you can then double the one star reviews. With the recent cancellation of America's Apollo missions you can then double again the one star reviews. I'm not sure if there is any other topic that most Americans are so hyper sensitive about than the Apollo moon landings. It's so extreme to be bordering on maniacal. The mere mention to someone that the moon landings might have been staged sends most Americans into a hyper frenzy to the point that the topic can't be discussed or debated without Apollo supporters throwing barbs and punches. So you know a movie such as this is going to get most people writing a negative review whether the movie deserves one or not. Sure the reviewer will claim the film is implausible or boring or what have you, but the heart of it is that they don't like America's most storied historical achievement (assuming of course that it actually happened) being tarnished in any way, shape or form - especially by a non-American.As for the movie itself I found it very entertaining and very suspenseful.

message.This is the conspiracy theorists playground and right up their alley.Nice try guys,but no cigars for any of you.Technically speaking,the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1,with some parts being full frame to simulate the camera technology of the 70s.Extras include multiple endings,several deleted and alternate scenes and commentary.All in all a complete waste of 86 minutes of film time and yours.",1,A conspiracy theorists dream!,1362096000,"03 1, 2013",2013,4210,"['18', 'released', 'Sept/11', 'Warren', 'Christie', 'Captain', 'Benjamin', 'Anderson', 'Lloyd', 'Owen', 'Commander', 'Nathan', 'Walker', 'Ryan', 'Robbins', 'Lieutenant', 'Colonel', 'John', 'Grey', 'Andrew', 'Airlie', 'Mission', 'Control', 'Michael', 'Kopsa', 'Deputy', 'Secretary', 'Defense.This', 'film', 'yet', '*sigh*', 'ANOTHER', 'prodigy', 'long', 'ever', 'growing', 'line', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'old', 'bait', 'switcheroo', 'fuzzy', 'fast', 'camera', 'cuts', 'dark', 'spooky', 'lighting', 'strange', 'noises', 'coming', 'etc.', 'etc.It', 'SO', 'predictable.This', 'latest', 'incarnation', 'moon', 'mission', 'never', 'officially', 'existed.The', 'opening', 'tells', 'movie', 'made', 'footage', 'inference', '34', 'real', '34', 'was', 'uploaded', 'certain', 'web', 'site', 'couple', 'years', 'ago.The', 'film', 'shot', 'using', 'aging', 'techniques', 'quite', 'common', 'use', 'today', 'make', 'look', '70s', 'film', 'stock.We', 'follow', 'three', 'astronauts', 'pre', 'flight', 'families', 'lift', 'off', 'journey', 'orbital', 'path', 'moon', 'two', 'astronauts', 'final', 'descent', 'landing.This', 'classified', 'mission', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'could', 'install', 'early', 'warning', 'instruments', 'detect', 'Soviet', 'missiles.Everything', 'up', 'moment', 'install', 'devices', 'smoothly.Of', 'course', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'last', 'forever', 'cue', 'creepy', 'noise', 'interference', 'intercoms', 'coming', 'find', 'strange', 'tracks', 'lunar', 'surface.They', 'also', 'find', 'Russian', 'space', 'module', 'landed', 'flight', 'pilot', 'dead', 'nearby', 'crater.The', 'officials', 'back', 'home', 'give', 'so', 'much', 'info', 'obvious', 'knew', 'Russians', 'mission.They', 'start', 'find', 'things', 'moved', 'around', 'LEM', 'communications', 'totally', 'fail.They', 'wake', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'find', 'U.S.flag', 'gone', 'ROVER', 'been', 'tipped', 'over.One', 'out', 'investigate', 'suddenly', 'reports', 'something', 'helmet', 'falls.The', 'other', 'out', 'in.He', 'limited', 'memory', 'recall', 'what', 'just', 'happened', 'find', 'laceration', 'rib', 'cage.In', 'fact', 'something', 'skin.They', 'manage', 'pull', 'out', 'brief', 'screeching', 'noise', 'look', 'down', 'just', 'lunar', 'rock.The', 'astronaut', 'infection', 'LEM', 'now', 'been', 'disabled', 'something', 'unknown', 'head', 'Russian', 'capsule.Along', 'way', 'ROVER', 'turned', 'infected', 'astronaut', 'wanders', 'off.The', 'other', 'looks', 'watches', 'pulled', 'crater', 'unseen', 'forces.He', 'watches', 'rocks', 'start', 'coming', 'life', 'around', 'him.He', 'flees', 'Russian', 'module', 'securely', 'inside.He', 'contact', 'third', 'astronaut', 'who', 'been', 'circling', 'moon', 'agree', 'rendezvous.Transmission', 'Earth', 'now', 'recommenced', 'NASA', 'warning', 'third', 'astronaut', 'not', 'rendezvous', 'compatriot.He', 'superiors', 'buddy', 'return.However', 'way', 'see', 'rocks', 'Russian', 'capsule', 'start', 'rise', 'come', 'life', 'attack', 'astronaut.In', 'distress', 'can', 'not', 'control', 'Russian', 'capsule', 'craft', 'crashes', 'other', 'most', 'likely', 'killing', 'both.The', 'film', 'typed', 'post', 'script', 'are', 'told', 'official', 'reasons', 'death', 'astronauts', 'earth', 'born', 'accidents', 'bodies', 'recovered.It', 'also', 'mentions', 'lunar', 'material', 'actually', 'brought', 'back', 'moon', 'been', 'given', 'away', 'foreign', 'countries', 'alot', 'simply', 'disappeared.I', 'must', 'say', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watched', 'lunar', 'landings', 'way', 'back', 'day', 're-creation', 'pretty', 'good', 'so', 'far', 'equipment', 'used', 'personal', 'story', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'predictable', 'quite', 'pedestrian', 'best.It', 'yet', 'case', 'taking', 'half', 'truths', 'inferences', 'making', 'grand', 'leaps', 'logic', 'convey', '34', 'truthful', '34', 'message.This', 'conspiracy', 'playground', 'right', 'up', 'alley.Nice', 'try', 'guys', 'cigars', 'you.Technically', 'speaking', 'film', 'w/s', 'a/r', '1:85:1', 'parts', 'being', 'full', 'frame', 'simulate', 'camera', 'technology', '70s.Extras', 'include', 'multiple', 'endings', 'several', 'deleted', 'alternate', 'scenes', 'commentary.All', 'complete', 'waste', '86', 'minutes', 'film', 'time', 'yours']",Apollo 18

I don't hate those movies perhaps as much as I should, especially given that I am prone to motion sickness. And for most of its length, Apollo 18 is a run-of-the-mill found-footage horror film, nothing special, nothing great. Then you get to the end of the movie, and if you have any shred of suspended disbelief left, you will start throwing things at the screen and demanding your money back. Even if it's your TV screen and you pay eight bucks a month for Netflix and you watch enough movies that you actually paid all of about three cents to watch this.Plot: There were officially seventeen Apollo missions. Supposedly, Apollo 18 posits, there was in fact an eighteenth Apollo mission in 1974. (Never mind that shakycams in 1974 would have been a bit larger than shakycams today.) Ben Anderson (This Means War's Warren Christie), Nate Walker (Miss Potter's Lloyd Owen), and John Grey (Passengers' Ryan Robbins) were the personnel; Grey staying in orbit around the moon, while Anderson and Walker touched down ostensibly to deliver some sort of listening equipment. When they get to the surface, however, they discover that it's possible what they were told they were sent to do and what they were actually sent to do are two very different things...All well and good, and it is certainly the case that any number of found-footage movies, including The Blair Witch Project, have devised mind-stretching &#8220;how this footage got out to the public&#8221; backstories for the footage finally making it to the public, Brian Miller, the guy behind Apollo 18, didn't even try; if you don't get to the end of this movie and ask yourself where that particular piece of the puzzle disappeared to, you're way better at suspending disbelief than I am. For that matter, things get silly about half an hour before that, but this is a horror movie, you have to expect that sort of thing. And until then, if you can shunt aside the fact that this is for the most part the plot of an old X-Files episode (telling you which would give the game away, and to be fair to the movie I didn't realize this until a couple of days after I'd finished the movie), it's decently-acted if not great, it draws on the time period it's set in as part of constructing the mystery at the heart of the film, and the creepies are effective and not overused&#8212;a rarity in this sort of film. I wish I could tell you &#8220;it's Frost/Nixon meets The Blair Witch Project!&#8221; and, had this gone through another rewrite or two with an eye towards believability and continuity, it might have been. Unfortunately, it's not, so you're stuck with the skeleton of what might have been and a not-too-terrible first act. **",2,"To the moon, Warren!",1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,2907,"['18', 'Gonzalo', 'L', 'oacute', 'pez-Gallego', '2011', 'had', 'somehow', 'missed', 'forgotten', 'Apollo', '18', 'yet', 'shakycam-found-footage', '8220', 'mockumentary', '8221', 'even', 'realizing', 'kept', 'watching', 'anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'movies', 'perhaps', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'especially', 'given', 'am', 'prone', 'motion', 'sickness', 'most', 'length', 'Apollo', '18', 'run-of-the-mill', 'found-footage', 'horror', 'film', 'nothing', 'special', 'nothing', 'great', 'Then', 'get', 'end', 'movie', 'have', 'shred', 'suspended', 'disbelief', 'left', 'will', 'start', 'throwing', 'things', 'screen', 'demanding', 'money', 'back', 'Even', 'TV', 'screen', 'pay', 'eight', 'bucks', 'month', 'Netflix', 'watch', 'enough', 'movies', 'actually', 'paid', 'about', 'three', 'cents', 'watch', 'this.Plot', 'were', 'officially', 'seventeen', 'Apollo', 'missions', 'Supposedly', 'Apollo', '18', 'posits', 'was', 'fact', 'eighteenth', 'Apollo', 'mission', '1974', 'Never', 'mind', 'shakycams', '1974', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'larger', 'shakycams', 'today', 'Ben', 'Anderson', 'Means', 'War', 'Warren', 'Christie', 'Nate', 'Walker', 'Miss', 'Potter', 'Lloyd', 'Owen', 'John', 'Grey', 'Passengers', 'Ryan', 'Robbins', 'were', 'personnel', 'Grey', 'staying', 'orbit', 'moon', 'Anderson', 'Walker', 'touched', 'down', 'ostensibly', 'deliver', 'sort', 'listening', 'equipment', 'When', 'get', 'surface', 'however', 'discover', 'possible', 'what', 'were', 'told', 'were', 'sent', 'do', 'what', 'were', 'actually', 'sent', 'do', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'things', 'well', 'good', 'certainly', 'case', 'number', 'found-footage', 'movies', 'including', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'have', 'devised', 'mind-stretching', '8220', 'how', 'footage', 'got', 'out', 'public', '8221', 'backstories', 'footage', 'finally', 'making', 'public', 'Brian', 'Miller', 'guy', 'Apollo', '18', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'end', 'movie', 'ask', 'where', 'particular', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'disappeared', ""'re"", 'way', 'better', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'am', 'matter', 'things', 'get', 'silly', 'hour', 'horror', 'movie', 'have', 'expect', 'sort', 'thing', 'then', 'can', 'shunt', 'aside', 'fact', 'most', 'part', 'plot', 'old', 'X-Files', 'episode', 'telling', 'would', 'give', 'game', 'away', 'be', 'fair', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'couple', 'days', ""'d"", 'finished', 'movie', 'decently-acted', 'not', 'great', 'time', 'period', 'set', 'part', 'constructing', 'mystery', 'heart', 'film', 'creepies', 'are', 'effective', 'not', 'overused', '8212', 'rarity', 'sort', 'film', 'wish', 'could', 'tell', '8220', 'Frost/Nixon', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', '8221', 'had', 'gone', 'rewrite', 'two', 'eye', 'towards', 'believability', 'continuity', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Unfortunately', 'not', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'skeleton', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'not-too-terrible', 'first', 'act', '**']",Apollo 18

Not only do they discover that the USSR has been there first, but they find a number of mysterious observations of seemingly natural phenomena.  The astronauts on the ground begin to suspect that they are not being told the full story of why they are there, with tragic results.In spite of the fact that none of the actors are well knowns, they do a very good job.

Apollo 18 is cancelled circa 1974...or is it? Perhaps it actually launched as a secret Department of Defense mission, so secret that the crew may not even be aware of why they are really heading to the moon. Once at the moon they embark on their supposed mission, but find that there is more to the task than what they signed up for.It's unfortunate that there's currently not a running format likeTales from the Cryptthat writers and directors can go to in order to present cool concepts like the one in Apollo 18, because this movie would have made a pretty good 26 minute short versus the hour and 26 minute long feature film. All of the story content and action could easily have been condensed into less than a half hour, which--done the right way--could have made for a creepy, edge of your seat thrill of a ride. But after 90 minutes of jumpy, static-filled, hand-held camera work with only moments of action at a time...the only time I found myself on the edge of my seat was as I was slipping off my couch in a doze.Sio if there's absolutely nothing else on TV and you see that Apollo 18 is starting on one of the premium cable channels, well...you can see for yourself whether I am right or wrong.

O'Blenis,"[5, 7]","One of the more unusual entries in the found-footage field, Apoloo 18 pieces together footage of a secret final mission to the moon in the 1970s, launched at night under cover of a routine satellite launch.  Using tapes and film reels from before the mission launch on Earth as well as material recorded onboard the moon lander, the orbiting ship and even cameras and microphones on and in the astronauts's space suits, the movie follows the events on that fateful mission and reveals the meaning behind the film's tagline, ""There's a reason we've never been back to the moon.""The small crew believes they're being sent to the moon to set up equipment that will serve as part of a space-based early warning system against a potential Russian missile attack.  After setting down, the astronauts make the surprise discovery of a Russian craft already in the vicinity, apparantly a recent landing, hastily abandoned and with no sign of the cosmonauts themselves.  From there, they go from simply making surprise discoveries to suspecting that there's A Lot about this mission that the higher-ups never told them, as findings and unexplained happenings on the moon's surface go from the merely unexpected to the baffling and eerie.Sometimes a movie rises and falls on how well it can make the really 'out there' seem real and credible.  If one was to just write down some of what happens in the movie's final stages it might sound preposterous to someone who hasn't seen the movie, but here the filmmakers make it work.  Well, to me they certainly did.  Judging by the unexpectedly low ratings the film often receives, obviously not everyone feels that way, but I thought the end stages and resolutions came off far more engaging and authentic than a number of other higher-profile, more widely seen space-based movies.The small cast does a great job, great suspense, the search for the fate of the missing cosmonauts, the conflict between the astronauts stuck in the unknown and the mission controllers back on Earth guiding them, and the final answers about what was really found on the moon that caused both the US and the Soviet Union to abruptly abandon the largest part of their fiercely competitive, multi-billion dollar space race, successfully round out this imaginative and surprisingly effective horror/science fiction hybrid.",5,SO Much Better Than It Gets Credit For,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,2333,"['One', 'more', 'unusual', 'entries', 'found-footage', 'field', 'Apoloo', '18', 'pieces', 'together', 'footage', 'secret', 'final', 'mission', 'moon', '1970s', 'launched', 'night', 'cover', 'routine', 'satellite', 'launch', 'Using', 'tapes', 'film', 'reels', 'mission', 'launch', 'Earth', 'as', 'well', 'material', 'recorded', 'moon', 'lander', 'orbiting', 'ship', 'even', 'cameras', 'microphones', 'astronauts', 'space', 'suits', 'movie', 'events', 'fateful', 'mission', 'meaning', 'film', 'tagline', 'reason', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'back', 'moon', 'small', 'crew', ""'re"", 'being', 'sent', 'moon', 'set', 'up', 'equipment', 'will', 'serve', 'part', 'space-based', 'early', 'warning', 'system', 'potential', 'Russian', 'missile', 'attack', 'setting', 'down', 'astronauts', 'make', 'surprise', 'discovery', 'Russian', 'craft', 'already', 'vicinity', 'apparantly', 'recent', 'landing', 'hastily', 'abandoned', 'sign', 'cosmonauts', 'there', 'go', 'simply', 'making', 'surprise', 'discoveries', 'suspecting', 'Lot', 'mission', 'higher-ups', 'never', 'told', 'findings', 'unexplained', 'happenings', 'moon', 'surface', 'go', 'merely', 'unexpected', 'baffling', 'movie', 'how', 'well', 'can', 'make', 'really', 'seem', 'real', 'credible', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'write', 'down', 'what', 'movie', 'final', 'stages', 'might', 'sound', 'preposterous', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'here', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'work', 'Well', 'certainly', 'did', 'Judging', 'unexpectedly', 'low', 'ratings', 'film', 'often', 'obviously', 'not', 'everyone', 'feels', 'way', 'thought', 'end', 'stages', 'resolutions', 'came', 'off', 'far', 'more', 'engaging', 'authentic', 'number', 'other', 'higher-profile', 'more', 'widely', 'seen', 'space-based', 'movies.The', 'small', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'great', 'suspense', 'search', 'fate', 'missing', 'cosmonauts', 'conflict', 'astronauts', 'stuck', 'unknown', 'mission', 'controllers', 'back', 'Earth', 'guiding', 'final', 'answers', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'found', 'moon', 'caused', 'US', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'abruptly', 'abandon', 'largest', 'part', 'fiercely', 'competitive', 'multi-billion', 'dollar', 'space', 'race', 'successfully', 'round', 'out', 'imaginative', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'horror/science', 'fiction', 'hybrid']",Apollo 18

pretty authentic in it's portrayal of a moon mission gone wrong (granted, I've never done any serious studying of any actual moon mission films, so enthusiasts of moon mission imagery will probably be able to pick this thing apart till the cows come home, but for the average viewer, I found it pretty real, I mean, at least the space suits didn't look like someone's mom had sewn them together with some bed sheets, which is always a plus in my book).But  that being said, this is not a film for people looking for a non-stop action rush, this is a slower burn type of film, in the same vain as the recent, Paranormal Activity movies, but in space.So if you like stuff to do with the moon landings and have a thing for revisionist history/conspiracy theories, then this film is your cup of tea (or, Tang, as it were, and if you didn't get that reference, then you're not as big a moon mission aficionado as you may have thought you were before you started to read this review '***SPOILER ALERT*** (go and watch the film, then come back and read this as I think you'll find it quite interestingly compelling)Okay, so here's my BIG overall problem with this film (and correct me if I'm wrong here) but what we're watching is supposedly, ""Found Footage"" taken during this ill fated mission, film footage, not video sent back to mission control on earth, cameras with actual film cartridges in them that have to be developed before they can be run through a projector to be watched (keeping in mind that this was way before digital camera technology came into existence).So here's my problem; how, if the film from the moon cameras (you know, the ones showing Ben meandering about the moon's surface trying to avoid his demented colleague and the rock spider/crab creatures, in his mad attempt to reach the Russian space ship and escape the lunar horror of it all) is still actually in the cameras (as we never see Ben getting the film from them, during his frantic flight for survival) and then what film Ben did manage to bring with him in the Russian space craft was blown up when the Russian craft and the moon obiter crashed, then how are we watching any of this footage???Let's see, we have some footage stranded on the moon, and the rest has been atomized in the collision between the two ships in lunar orbit, and even if, let's say for the sake of argument, that another mission went back to the moon, better prepared to fight off the, ""Moon Mites"", then all that they would have is the stuff taken on the moon's surface and nothing taken from inside the space ships because that has been lost in the collision of the two ships in orbit.So there you have the BIGGEST deterrent to the possible believability of this movie, the one thing that they shot themselves in the foot with, the lack of any explanation as to how any surviving footage could have, well, made it's way back to earth to be, ""Leaked"" to the internet in the first place (had they been using video cameras everywhere that sent video images and sound, back to mission control then sure, this would have been plausible, but the fact that at one point Ben is gathering up film cartages to be taken back to earth (before everything went, ""Loopy"") and we never see him bring said film cartridges to the Russian ship at the end (and like I mentioned, even if he had, the ship collides with the lunar orbiter in orbit around the moon) so anyway you slice it, the film could never have made it back to Earth.Also, really, rock creatures, hasn't that been done to death, but I guess that is the only way they could try and add a, ""Chill"" factor to the films end by indicating that lots of moon rocks have made their way to earth during the previous 17 Apollo missions and could in fact be rock creatures as well (but the stupid flaw in this theory is that it is indicated that the rocks that are these creatures, are from a recent impact site, which would indicate that the rock creatures were not indigenous to the moon but travelled there on this meteor or asteroid piece of space junk, which would also mean that they weren't present during the other 17 Apollo missions if this impact site was recent).",4,Good

1402051,AOE0XMITAJWDT,B004EPYZXK,Terry Sunday,"[2, 3]","I didn't see ""Apollo 18"" when it hit the theatres in September 2011 because it garnered almost uniformly horrible reviews on RottenTomatoes. I decided not to pay to see a movie that was panned so badly. But after it came out on DVD, I finally succumbed to curiosity and checked it out of the library. I must say it's not as bad as I expected.Appealing to my space geekiness, ""Apollo 18"" features very realistic spaceflight hardware. The Apollo Service and Lunar Modules, the Lunar Roving Vehicle and the astronauts' spacesuits are very accurate, detailed and well-done. We rarely see the spacecraft exteriors, but the interior sets are great. While many viewers may not know it, the Soviet LK lander that plays a major role in ""Apollo 18"" represented real hardware. Despite denying it was in a race with the U.S., the Soviet Union tried feverishly to develop its huge, ill-fated N1 rocket specifically to launch manned spacecraft to the moon. The LK was the equivalent of the Apollo LM, and would have taken a cosmonaut down to the surface and back. ""Apollo 18"" depicts the LK very accurately. The scenes of it on the lunar surface convey a chilling sense of ""what might have been.""The physical and digital lunar surface sets in ""Apollo 18"" are also striking. It's a far more rugged and rocky area than the actual Apollo landing sites, but the rationalization is that the Apollo 18 LM landed near the moon's heavily cratered South Pole. The combination of starkly beautiful gray-and-black landscapes and dramatic low-angle sunlight provides fantastic-looking, evocative images of the lunar surface. In short, the photography, lighting and visual effects in ""Apollo 18"" are superb, and they integrate perfectly with the occasional genuine NASA footage.But there are many problems with the film. As one who never saw ""The Blair Witch Project"" or ""Paranormal Activity"" (although I will cop to seeing ""Cloverfield""), I think the ""found footage"" moviemaking concept is a gimmick that has outlived its novelty. There's no reason to use it in ""Apollo 18."" The jerky hand-held camera shots, lens flares, over- and under-exposures, light leaks, color shifts and scratched film get tiresome pretty quickly. I believe the movie would have been MUCH better as a straightforward, conventionally filmed narrative. It's also way too short. Its scant 86 minutes of run time includes--I'm not making this up--more than 10 minutes of closing credits, so it's basically 76 minutes long! The plot unfolds so quickly that the viewer never really gets to know the characters, and everything seems rushed. The film should be about 30 to 45 minutes longer. The ""monsters"" are almost laughably lame. The filmmakers have an interesting idea for life forms that exist in the perpetual darkness of a lunar polar crater, but they never do much to develop it in detail. Also, the audio sucks, with wild variations of levels, indistinct and mumbled dialogue, interminable screaming and constant weird noises. The only way I could watch ""Apollo 18"" was to crank the volume down low and turn on the subtitles.I'm glad I didn't waste time or money seeing ""Apollo 18"" at the theatre, but I'm equally glad I caught it on DVD. It's not a bad movie, but in my opinion it could have been much better. The story is intriguing, but the telling of it suffers from extreme brevity, distracting cinematic techniques, a dreadful soundtrack and slipshod editing in a few places (as the filmmakers admit in the audio commentary). Excellent production values and superb special effects are not enough to save it, just as the incalculable benefits of exploring another world were not enough to save the REAL Apollo 18 from the budgetary axes of shortsighted politicians.",3,"Not Too Bad, but Could Have Been Much Better",1327276800,"01 23, 2012",2012,3721,"['did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Apollo', '18', 'when', 'hit', 'theatres', 'September', '2011', 'garnered', 'almost', 'uniformly', 'horrible', 'reviews', 'RottenTomatoes', 'decided', 'not', 'pay', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'panned', 'so', 'badly', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'finally', 'succumbed', 'curiosity', 'checked', 'library', 'must', 'say', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'expected.Appealing', 'space', 'geekiness', 'Apollo', '18', 'features', 'very', 'realistic', 'spaceflight', 'hardware', 'Apollo', 'Service', 'Lunar', 'Modules', 'Lunar', 'Roving', 'Vehicle', 'astronauts', 'spacesuits', 'are', 'very', 'accurate', 'detailed', 'well-done', 'rarely', 'see', 'spacecraft', 'exteriors', 'interior', 'sets', 'are', 'great', 'many', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'Soviet', 'LK', 'lander', 'major', 'role', 'Apollo', '18', 'represented', 'real', 'hardware', 'denying', 'was', 'race', 'U.S.', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'tried', 'feverishly', 'develop', 'huge', 'ill-fated', 'N1', 'rocket', 'specifically', 'launch', 'manned', 'spacecraft', 'moon', 'LK', 'was', 'equivalent', 'Apollo', 'LM', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'cosmonaut', 'down', 'surface', 'back', '18', 'LK', 'very', 'accurately', 'scenes', 'lunar', 'surface', 'chilling', 'sense', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'physical', 'digital', 'lunar', 'surface', 'sets', 'Apollo', '18', 'are', 'also', 'striking', 'far', 'more', 'rugged', 'rocky', 'area', 'actual', 'Apollo', 'landing', 'sites', 'rationalization', 'Apollo', '18', 'LM', 'landed', 'moon', 'heavily', 'cratered', 'South', 'Pole', 'combination', 'starkly', 'beautiful', 'gray-and-black', 'landscapes', 'dramatic', 'low-angle', 'sunlight', 'fantastic-looking', 'evocative', 'images', 'lunar', 'surface', 'short', 'photography', 'lighting', 'visual', 'effects', 'Apollo', '18', 'are', 'superb', 'integrate', 'perfectly', 'occasional', 'genuine', 'NASA', 'footage.But', 'are', 'many', 'problems', 'film', 'one', 'who', 'never', 'saw', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'will', 'cop', 'seeing', 'Cloverfield', 'think', 'found', 'footage', 'moviemaking', 'concept', 'gimmick', 'outlived', 'novelty', 'reason', 'use', 'Apollo', '18', 'jerky', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'shots', 'flares', 'over-', 'under-exposures', 'light', 'leaks', 'color', 'shifts', 'scratched', 'film', 'get', 'tiresome', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'believe', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'MUCH', 'better', 'straightforward', 'conventionally', 'filmed', 'narrative', 'also', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'scant', '86', 'minutes', 'run', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'making', 'up', 'more', '10', 'minutes', 'closing', 'credits', 'basically', '76', 'minutes', 'long', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'so', 'quickly', 'viewer', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'characters', 'everything', 'rushed', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'about', '30', '45', 'minutes', 'longer', 'monsters', 'are', 'almost', 'laughably', 'lame', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'interesting', 'idea', 'life', 'forms', 'exist', 'perpetual', 'darkness', 'lunar', 'polar', 'crater', 'never', 'do', 'much', 'develop', 'detail', 'Also', 'audio', 'sucks', 'wild', 'variations', 'levels', 'indistinct', 'mumbled', 'dialogue', 'interminable', 'screaming', 'constant', 'weird', 'noises', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'watch', 'Apollo', '18', 'was', 'crank', 'volume', 'down', 'low', 'turn', 'subtitles.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'seeing', '18', 'theatre', ""'m"", 'equally', 'glad', 'caught', 'DVD', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'opinion', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'story', 'intriguing', 'telling', 'extreme', 'brevity', 'distracting', 'cinematic', 'techniques', 'dreadful', 'soundtrack', 'slipshod', 'editing', 'few', 'places', 'filmmakers', 'admit', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Excellent', 'production', 'values', 'superb', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'just', 'incalculable', 'benefits', 'exploring', 'world', 'were', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'REAL', 'Apollo', '18', 'budgetary', 'axes', 'shortsighted', 'politicians']",Apollo 18

The movie cleverly combines actual film footage of NASA with their own track over and their own film. They were careful enough to use side lighting to create the long shadows seen in the NASA films. I appreciate it when they do their homework. The cameras have been put in place. This avoids much of that sea sick motion you get from the other reality (translate:cheap) type movies.Now the reason why they really went there was to check on the Russians who have landed a LEM (looks like a diving bell) on the moon. The crew was not informed about this so they really panicked when they found another set of footprints. What we know:1)The Russian is dead, apparently killed.2) There is a strange rock that seems to move on its own, but we don't see it move.3) There is a strange crater/shaft made from different rock which is at the heart of the problem.4) There are communication issues and there appears to be strange going-ons outside the LEM that suggests visitors.Now I hate hand held reality movies. My finger is on the fast forward button more than a lab rat pressing for cheese. But this one held my interest.

Directed by Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego, ""Apollo 18"" is visually impressive, with footage that looks authentic, but its storytelling is just boring.The film needs someone like Duncan Jones, who knows how to grab our attention by effectively developing the film's original concept, or perhaps a more conventional narrative style that does not rely on frequent POV shots.",2,Mission So Boring,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,1080,"['Yet', 'found', 'footage', 'genre', 'movie', 'Apollo', '18', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'cancelled', 'Apollo', '18', 'mission', 'potential', 'better', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'Co-produced', 'Timur', 'Bekmambetov', 'Night', 'Watch', 'Wanted', 'mocumentary', 'story', 'three', 'astronauts', 'top', 'secret', 'mission', 'moon', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'fashion', 'end', 'result', 'dull', 'thrill-less', '86-minute', 'ride.Those', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'something', 'intelligent', 'Forbidden', 'Planet', 'more', 'recently', 'Moon', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'how', 'film', 'opening', 'surely', 'promising', 'quickly', 'series', 'set-pieces', 'are', 'unimaginative', 'predictable', 'heavily', 'dependent', 'cheap', 'fright', 'techniques', 'Directed', 'Gonzalo', 'Lopez-Gallego', 'Apollo', '18', 'visually', 'impressive', 'footage', 'authentic', 'storytelling', 'just', 'boring.The', 'film', 'someone', 'Duncan', 'Jones', 'who', 'how', 'grab', 'attention', 'effectively', 'developing', 'film', 'original', 'concept', 'perhaps', 'more', 'conventional', 'narrative', 'style', 'not', 'rely', 'frequent', 'POV', 'shots']",Apollo 18

Taking the ""found footage"" and conspiracy theor to absurd extremes, the makers of ""Apollo 18"" propose that the space program continued AFTER Apollo 17 and a secret DOD mission was sent up to set up ICBM monitoring devices on the moon. There was one problem. The astronauts found out we aren't alone.The film itself has plot holes big enough to fly the now retired space shuttle through and the film is all set up with very little in the way of plot development. The main flaw that dogs ALL found footage type of films also exists here--we really can't have much in the way of dramatic developments because we can't SEE everything that has happened outside the scope of the camera shooting the ""real"" drama. The film feels padded at a paltry 90 minutes and seems twice as long. The premise and execution might have worked well as an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""The Outer Limits"" but without any major plot developments over the course of 90 minutes (look their doing another EVA)the film feels 89 minutes too long.There's the kernal of a good idea in ""Apollo 18"" but because of the execution and decision to shoot it as a ""found footage"" type of film, the plot isn't allowed to pop to life and fulfill its potential. ""Apollo 18"" would have worked much better as a science fiction or horror thriller shot like ""Alien"".If you bought the Blu-ray for this you've wasted your money as the image quality is comparable to a standard DVD. The director does a nice job of mixing real NASA footage with the soundstage footage of the Apollo 18 crew exploring the surface of the moon but, honestly, the BD doesn't provide an improvement in image quality making it worth the extra expense.Most of the special features aren't anything to radio home about either as they include an audio commentary with director Gonzalo L&oacute;pez-Gallego and editor Patrick Lussier, deleted and alternate scenes and alternate endings.

In the beginning, you are chewing your nails wondering what is happening. Honestly, in all of these outer space sci fi horror/suspense movies, I am usually disappointed with the outcome. This was no different. This movie could have been much better. When you find out the source of the suspense, it's kind of a let down. Then it goes from that to predictable. You can just see what's coming next & it does. Since most of this movie is grainy old film, Blu-Ray won't be much of an investment. What made this story sound good was that we all know & believe that the Dept of Defense would conduct secret missions, could send men to the moon or anywhere else without even their family knowing. This gave the basis of the movie, and the fact that it was going to be a space mission, a lot of potential. Eventually it just turns out to be another cheesy scifi movie.

There was a single, nearly insurmountable  problem: if the movie was constructed of ""found footage"" left behind by the guys on the last mission to the moon, who went to the moon to fetch the cameras?  Even if there was a TV camera sending footage back to NASA on Earth in such a way no one else would pick it up, there would only be one feed....which fails to account for all the camera angles.  (Most footage we have of the moon landings was taken by film cameras not TV cameras.)  And for critical periods of the movie, they are out of touch with Earth anyway.
