How does it really stack up? In my opinion, not very well. While the show is entertaining, in a way, it falls apart pretty quick.Let me preface things by saying, yes, I have read all five of the novels in the series that are currently out. The books are nothing shy of incredible. The stories are balanced and I have to give credit to George RR Martin for being able to juggle all these characters and stories into one book series. That, in and of itself, is no small feat.The characters in the show are pretty much as they are in the books, not a whole lot of differences overall. However the whole thing with Sir Loris and Renley Boratheon was a bit jarring since it really never came up in the novels. Was it suggested in the books? It's possible, but I really don't remember that happening. Also there are several characters missing from the whole story that are critical characters even though they are &#34;second line&#34; characters at best. Moon Boy, Patch Face, and Strong Belwas are all missing. There are a number of inconsistencies in the plot line of the show. The first big one was Catlin Stark's meeting with Tirion at the Inn in book one (season one).I'm going to throw up the huge ((SPOILER ALERT)) signal here. Yes, Jeoffrey is a royal masterpiece of evil (literally). He is in the books and he's ten times worse in the TV series. In the second season he takes to torturing and maiming ladies-of-the-evening. It's downright sick and I think the point is a bit too-overdrawn in the TV series. In the third season he takes up murdering these same kinds of women with his crossbow just for fun. Now, don't twist my words here, but in the book he only killed cats with his crossbow. Either way, it's horrible, and it's used as a plot device to make you hate Joffrey. While it does work I find it a bit disturbing that in a television show such as this killing domesticated animals is looked upon as sacreligeous and disgusting but the same kid killing and maiming women is looked over as just a convenient plot device. It just seems a bit out of balance to me. You can take your fingers out of your ears now. ((END SPOILERS))While I know it's a TV show and they're not going to go and be 100% accurate to the book the differences become more and more inconsistent and jarring as the show goes on. I've watched the first three seasons (this boxed set only contains the first two) so I thought it might be a good idea to mention it. As the seasons go it becomes more and more apparent that the show has a lot of content and the amount of time they are spending on it isn't nearly enough. It has been said that the series is planned to only on on for a total of seven seasons. Season four is currently debuting on HBO and that only takes us up through the end of the third book and through a bit of the fourth (though admittedly the fourth book is a pretty tedious read). With the release date for the sixth book nowhere in sight, and supposedly at least one more book after that remaining in the series, I'm becoming very wary that this series will devolve into speculative screen writing rather than getting the info from the original creator (Mr. Martin). As such my hopes for this show to be truly memorable are rather low.The show is entertaining but only just so.",2,Not all it's cracked up to be...,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,3386,"['Yes', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'violence', 'shocking', 'amounts', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'How', 'really', 'stack', 'up', 'opinion', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'show', 'entertaining', 'way', 'apart', 'pretty', 'quick.Let', 'preface', 'things', 'saying', 'yes', 'have', 'read', 'five', 'novels', 'series', 'are', 'currently', 'books', 'are', 'nothing', 'shy', 'incredible', 'stories', 'are', 'balanced', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'George', 'RR', 'Martin', 'being', 'able', 'juggle', 'characters', 'stories', 'one', 'book', 'series', 'small', 'feat.The', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'are', 'books', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'differences', 'overall', 'However', 'whole', 'thing', 'Sir', 'Loris', 'Renley', 'Boratheon', 'was', 'bit', 'jarring', 'really', 'never', 'came', 'up', 'novels', 'Was', 'suggested', 'books', 'possible', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'happening', 'Also', 'are', 'several', 'characters', 'missing', 'whole', 'story', 'are', 'critical', 'characters', 'even', 'are', '34', 'second', 'line', '34', 'characters', 'best', 'Moon', 'Boy', 'Patch', 'Face', 'Strong', 'Belwas', 'are', 'missing', 'are', 'number', 'inconsistencies', 'plot', 'line', 'show', 'first', 'big', 'one', 'was', 'Catlin', 'Stark', 'meeting', 'Tirion', 'Inn', 'book', 'one', 'season', 'one', '.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'throw', 'up', 'huge', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'signal', 'here', 'Yes', 'Jeoffrey', 'royal', 'masterpiece', 'evil', 'literally', 'books', 'ten', 'times', 'worse', 'TV', 'series', 'second', 'season', 'torturing', 'maiming', 'ladies-of-the-evening', 'downright', 'sick', 'think', 'point', 'bit', 'too-overdrawn', 'TV', 'series', 'third', 'season', 'up', 'murdering', 'same', 'kinds', 'women', 'crossbow', 'just', 'fun', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'twist', 'words', 'here', 'book', 'only', 'killed', 'cats', 'crossbow', 'way', 'horrible', 'used', 'plot', 'device', 'make', 'hate', 'Joffrey', 'work', 'find', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'television', 'show', 'such', 'killing', 'domesticated', 'animals', 'looked', 'sacreligeous', 'disgusting', 'same', 'kid', 'killing', 'maiming', 'women', 'looked', 'as', 'just', 'convenient', 'plot', 'device', 'just', 'bit', 'balance', 'can', 'take', 'fingers', 'ears', 'now', 'END', 'SPOILERS', 'know', 'TV', 'show', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'go', 'be', '100', '%', 'accurate', 'book', 'differences', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'inconsistent', 'jarring', 'show', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'boxed', 'set', 'only', 'first', 'two', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'mention', 'seasons', 'go', 'more', 'more', 'apparent', 'show', 'lot', 'content', 'amount', 'time', 'are', 'spending', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'enough', 'been', 'said', 'series', 'planned', 'only', 'total', 'seven', 'seasons', 'Season', 'four', 'currently', 'debuting', 'HBO', 'only', 'up', 'end', 'third', 'book', 'bit', 'fourth', 'admittedly', 'fourth', 'book', 'pretty', 'tedious', 'read', 'release', 'date', 'sixth', 'book', 'nowhere', 'sight', 'supposedly', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'book', 'remaining', 'series', ""'m"", 'becoming', 'very', 'wary', 'series', 'will', 'devolve', 'speculative', 'screen', 'writing', 'rather', 'getting', 'info', 'original', 'creator', 'Mr.', 'Martin', 'such', 'hopes', 'show', 'be', 'truly', 'memorable', 'are', 'rather', 'low.The', 'show', 'entertaining', 'only', 'just', 'so']",N/A
