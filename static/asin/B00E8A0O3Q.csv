1665094,A1PN1R385J3NP,B00E8A0O3Q,Aaron Small,"[5, 8]","Guitar icon SLASH, who made a name for himself with GUNS N' ROSES, VELVET REVOLVER, and then as a solo artist, has launched his own horror movie production company, Slasher Films, and Nothing Left To Fear is their first endeavour. To be clear, Slash does not star in the movie; he co-produced the 100-minute feature, and co-wrote the musical score. Directed by Anthony Leonardi III, Nothing Left To Fear was inspired by the legend of Stull, Kansas - one of the Seven Gates of Hell. The story centers on a pastor relocating his family from the big city to a small town, where unbeknownst to them, the locals are not what they seem. After moving into their new house, his eldest teenage daughter experiences gruesome nightmares, but a fate far worse befalls her sister - demonic possession. Whilst paying tribute to traditional elements of the genre, Nothing Left To Fear also employs a few new twists, resulting in a truly gripping ride. Despite a lengthy beginning which serves to establish the characters, the spook-you moments are genuine and not forced. Then when the carnage is unleashed, it's done incredibly well. While blood is spilled, it's not graphic or gory, making the viewer realize this ""fictional story"" could actually be fact. Filmed on location in Louisiana, Nothing Left To Fear combines superb casting, an excellent script, and terrific cinematography. Ultimately this is a killer piece, and simultaneously comes to a conclusive ending, while presenting the opportunity for a sequel. Finally, don't leave the theater, or press stop at home, before the credits roll. Cause if you do, you'll miss the brand new song, titled `Nothing Left To Fear', from Slash and Myles Kennedy.",4,Nothing Left To Fear,1380240000,"09 27, 2013",2013,1694,"['Guitar', 'icon', 'SLASH', 'who', 'made', 'name', 'GUNS', 'N', 'ROSES', 'VELVET', 'REVOLVER', 'then', 'solo', 'artist', 'launched', 'own', 'horror', 'movie', 'production', 'company', 'Slasher', 'Films', 'Nothing', 'Left', 'Fear', 'first', 'endeavour', 'be', 'clear', 'Slash', 'not', 'star', 'movie', 'co-produced', '100-minute', 'feature', 'co-wrote', 'musical', 'score', 'Directed', 'Anthony', 'Leonardi', 'III', 'Nothing', 'Left', 'Fear', 'was', 'inspired', 'legend', 'Stull', 'Kansas', 'one', 'Seven', 'Gates', 'Hell', 'story', 'centers', 'pastor', 'relocating', 'family', 'big', 'city', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'unbeknownst', 'locals', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'seem', 'moving', 'new', 'house', 'eldest', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'gruesome', 'nightmares', 'fate', 'far', 'worse', 'sister', 'demonic', 'possession', 'Whilst', 'paying', 'tribute', 'traditional', 'elements', 'genre', 'Nothing', 'Left', 'Fear', 'also', 'few', 'new', 'twists', 'resulting', 'truly', 'gripping', 'ride', 'lengthy', 'beginning', 'establish', 'characters', 'spook-you', 'moments', 'are', 'genuine', 'not', 'forced', 'Then', 'when', 'carnage', 'unleashed', 'done', 'incredibly', 'well', 'blood', 'spilled', 'not', 'graphic', 'gory', 'making', 'viewer', 'realize', 'fictional', 'story', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'fact', 'Filmed', 'location', 'Louisiana', 'Nothing', 'Left', 'Fear', 'combines', 'superb', 'casting', 'excellent', 'script', 'terrific', 'cinematography', 'Ultimately', 'killer', 'piece', 'simultaneously', 'conclusive', 'ending', 'presenting', 'opportunity', 'sequel', 'Finally', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'theater', 'press', 'stop', 'home', 'credits', 'roll', 'Cause', 'do', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'brand', 'new', 'song', 'titled', 'Nothing', 'Left', 'Fear', 'Slash', 'Myles', 'Kennedy']",N/A
1665095,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B00E8A0O3Q,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[2, 3]","Well there's not much new here. &#34;Nothing Left To Fear&#34; tells a fairly silly story of a small town with a deadly secret, and when a new pastor and his family arrive they get tangled up in a web of kidnapping, blood sacrifice and possession.There are spoilers in this review.The first 15 minutes or so will give you a hint of what's to come...one of the characters has a nightmare in which a woman appears and in a &#34;surprise shock&#34; effect, the woman's eyes turn to sunken black and her mouth gapes open, also black. Oh, really, give me a break... This effect has been recycled and recycled in horror movies now for almost a decade, and it's really time some new ideas surfaced. Anyway, the family start to realise something is wrong, but they take their sweet time about it, and it's unsurprising to see that they are soon at the mercy of the entire town and their terrible secret rite that has been planned all along. The secret rite itself really doesn't make a lot of sense, and what made me laugh at first is that the rite is done twice, once to unleash a horrible evil, and then repeated at some arbitrary point later in the film, this time to seal the evil back up again. Umm...wouldn't it have saved time just not to do the secret rite at all? Like, ever? Ok, I assume that without the secret rites being done at all, something far worse would go on, but there's no sense of what this might be, the script just makes the townsfolk in to cheerless bystanders and the main &#34;bad guys&#34; into characterless goons.The lame script doesn't really help. Dozens of horror movie standard scenes are poured into the mix. Chase scenes where characters don't do anything logical that would actually result in them getting away, like driving out of town. Lots and LOTS of shots of blackened eyes and gaping black mouths. Waaay too many of these. And the dialogue doesn't help either. Girl: &#34;Something's going on here, what is it? &#34; Boy: &#34;Not now. I have to go&#34;. Great stuff. Boy: &#34;There's something I have to tell you.&#34; Girl: &#34; What is it?&#34; Girls kid brother, barging in: &#34;Hey sis, come quick, something's up!&#34; Damned kid brothers and their bad timing!The acting is only passable, but what I did like is the fact that the possession takes a hold of what seemed to be an almost throwaway supporting character at the start of the movie. There are some good sceens when this character is just starting to become ill, and these are more creepy than the full scale goof-out that happens in the last 30 minutes of the film, which is all CGI and really shows that this is not the medium of choice for quick horror effects, and you can spot every bit of CGI every time.Although it's competently filmed and looks n ice and professional, it doesn't show any originality at all, it just screams &#34;Bandwagon&#34;. There are loads of 'small town secret&#34; horror films out there, like &#34;The Shrine&#34;, which this movie shares many elements with, but &#34;The Shrine&#34; is far superior, better made and with a better plot. Sorry folks, I guess you could have fun renting this out but I don't think it is going to hang around in the memory.",2,Too many cliches,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,3190,"['Well', 'not', 'much', 'new', 'here', '34', 'Nothing', 'Left', 'Fear', '34', 'fairly', 'silly', 'story', 'small', 'town', 'deadly', 'secret', 'when', 'new', 'pastor', 'family', 'arrive', 'get', 'tangled', 'up', 'web', 'kidnapping', 'blood', 'sacrifice', 'possession.There', 'are', 'spoilers', 'review.The', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'will', 'give', 'hint', 'what', 'come', 'one', 'characters', 'nightmare', 'woman', '34', 'surprise', 'shock', '34', 'effect', 'woman', 'eyes', 'turn', 'sunken', 'black', 'mouth', 'gapes', 'open', 'also', 'black', 'Oh', 'really', 'give', 'break', 'effect', 'been', 'recycled', 'recycled', 'horror', 'movies', 'now', 'almost', 'decade', 'really', 'time', 'new', 'ideas', 'surfaced', 'Anyway', 'family', 'start', 'realise', 'something', 'wrong', 'take', 'sweet', 'time', 'unsurprising', 'see', 'are', 'soon', 'mercy', 'entire', 'town', 'terrible', 'secret', 'rite', 'been', 'planned', 'along', 'secret', 'rite', 'really', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'what', 'made', 'laugh', 'first', 'rite', 'done', 'twice', 'once', 'unleash', 'horrible', 'evil', 'then', 'repeated', 'arbitrary', 'point', 'later', 'film', 'time', 'seal', 'evil', 'back', 'up', 'again', 'Umm', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'saved', 'time', 'just', 'not', 'do', 'secret', 'rite', 'ever', 'Ok', 'assume', 'secret', 'rites', 'being', 'done', 'something', 'far', 'worse', 'would', 'go', 'sense', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'script', 'just', 'townsfolk', 'cheerless', 'bystanders', 'main', '34', 'bad', 'guys', '34', 'characterless', 'goons.The', 'lame', 'script', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'Dozens', 'horror', 'movie', 'standard', 'scenes', 'are', 'poured', 'mix', 'Chase', 'where', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'logical', 'would', 'actually', 'result', 'getting', 'away', 'driving', 'town', 'Lots', 'LOTS', 'shots', 'blackened', 'eyes', 'gaping', 'black', 'mouths', 'Waaay', 'too', 'many', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'Girl', '34', 'Something', 'going', 'here', 'what', '34', 'Boy', '34', 'Not', 'now', 'have', 'go', '34', 'Great', 'stuff', 'Boy', '34', 'something', 'have', 'tell', 'you.', '34', 'Girl', '34', 'What', '34', 'Girls', 'brother', 'barging', '34', 'Hey', 'sis', 'come', 'quick', 'something', 'up', '34', 'Damned', 'kid', 'brothers', 'bad', 'timing', 'acting', 'only', 'passable', 'what', 'did', 'like', 'fact', 'possession', 'hold', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'almost', 'throwaway', 'supporting', 'character', 'start', 'movie', 'are', 'good', 'sceens', 'when', 'character', 'just', 'starting', 'become', 'ill', 'are', 'more', 'creepy', 'full', 'scale', 'goof-out', 'last', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'CGI', 'really', 'not', 'medium', 'choice', 'quick', 'horror', 'effects', 'can', 'spot', 'bit', 'CGI', 'competently', 'filmed', 'n', 'ice', 'professional', ""n't"", 'show', 'originality', 'just', 'screams', '34', 'Bandwagon', '34', 'are', 'loads', ""'small"", 'town', 'secret', '34', 'horror', 'there', '34', 'Shrine', '34', 'movie', 'shares', 'many', 'elements', '34', 'Shrine', '34', 'far', 'superior', 'better', 'made', 'better', 'plot', 'Sorry', 'folks', 'guess', 'could', 'have', 'fun', 'renting', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'going', 'hang', 'around', 'memory']",N/A

1665097,A1H7TF4P1FUC4P,B00E8A0O3Q,Big Johnson,"[3, 4]","I don't have much to add to these already great reviews except to say the movie is a complete knock off mostly of the HALLOWEEN franchise (in addition to the others you guys mentioned).1. Remember in Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers; and the other movies, it was explained that Michael was to kill all of his family as a sort of sacrifice to ward off a greater evil or destruction to the world? Same thing with her. He had the curse of the &#34;thorn&#34; or something like that; she had a big tooth that looked like a thorn in a cake. She also had the lemonade curse and others.2. Also, that Michael kind of quietly stalks his victims, but is always tricked somehow and near-killed allowing the others to get away? The demon in this movie was tricked into the church to &#34;close the door.&#34; Notice Michael always comes back to try to complete his mission of getting the family member.It's the same basic story. Basically, when Michael misses his victim, he starts killing others around. I swear to you on this movie on the part where her little brother got inside the house, I thought the demon was going to &#34;break the norm&#34; somehow and go inside the blood-marked X house to get its prey.Basically the same as Halloween series.If I had never seen other horror movies, I'd have liked this movie a lot as everything would not have been so familiar.A decent, morality in the grey area type of horror movie. Pretty good considering since the end of the Cold War, there is less of a polarized world. Less of a &#34;Good and Evil&#34; world of black and white. It's a grey area. Watch movies from the 1950s through the early 1970s especially, and in general from the 1950s to 1990 and you see that simple conception of evil and good. In this movie, it's hard to call anyone evil at the end except the demon itself. I'd still wish to find some other way than sacrificing other families.",3,"Moral Gray Area Kind of Movie and Same plot line as other movies, especially HALLOWEEN;",1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,1894,"['do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'add', 'already', 'great', 'reviews', 'say', 'movie', 'complete', 'knock', 'off', 'mostly', 'HALLOWEEN', 'franchise', 'addition', 'others', 'guys', 'mentioned', '.1', 'Remember', 'Halloween', 'Curse', 'Michael', 'Myers', 'other', 'movies', 'was', 'explained', 'Michael', 'was', 'kill', 'family', 'sort', 'sacrifice', 'ward', 'off', 'greater', 'evil', 'destruction', 'world', 'Same', 'thing', 'had', 'curse', '34', 'thorn', '34', 'something', 'had', 'big', 'tooth', 'looked', 'thorn', 'cake', 'also', 'had', 'lemonade', 'curse', 'others.2', 'Also', 'Michael', 'kind', 'quietly', 'victims', 'always', 'tricked', 'somehow', 'near-killed', 'allowing', 'others', 'get', 'away', 'demon', 'movie', 'was', 'tricked', 'church', '34', 'close', 'door.', '34', 'Notice', 'Michael', 'always', 'back', 'try', 'complete', 'mission', 'getting', 'family', 'member.It', 'same', 'basic', 'story', 'Basically', 'when', 'Michael', 'victim', 'killing', 'others', 'swear', 'movie', 'part', 'where', 'little', 'brother', 'got', 'house', 'thought', 'demon', 'was', 'going', '34', 'break', 'norm', '34', 'somehow', 'go', 'blood-marked', 'X', 'house', 'get', 'prey.Basically', 'same', 'Halloween', 'series.If', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'everything', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'familiar.A', 'decent', 'morality', 'grey', 'area', 'type', 'horror', 'movie', 'Pretty', 'good', 'considering', 'end', 'Cold', 'War', 'less', 'polarized', 'world', 'Less', '34', 'Good', 'Evil', '34', 'world', 'black', 'white', 'grey', 'area', 'Watch', 'movies', '1950s', 'early', '1970s', 'especially', 'general', '1950s', '1990', 'see', 'simple', 'conception', 'evil', 'good', 'movie', 'hard', 'call', 'anyone', 'evil', 'end', 'demon', ""'d"", 'still', 'wish', 'find', 'other', 'way', 'sacrificing', 'other', 'families']",N/A

Also, the effects of the black smoke swirls inky strands aren't that great.  Looks like the demon dabbed on a bit too much black eye shadow. The movie also leaves the viewer to assume the rituals haven one right after another.  The town knows they happen and all look unhappy about it but no one tries to do anything about it.  The demon lives in a well and must be appeased and that is all we really know about that.  Why they have a tooth and where they got it much less who got it is never revealed.  Why the red X on the door is never revealed.  I'm guessing it is similar to The Village as to why the X is there.  The whole town was afraid yet no one tried to leave.  Even the remaining family member stayed to see it done over and over and over.  Why would one stay in a town that destroyed their family?

1665101,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00E8A0O3Q,C. Sawin,"[4, 7]","Making the adjustment from living in a big city to moving to a small town in the country can be a little overwhelming, but that's just what Pastor Dan (James Tupper), his wife Wendy (Anne Heche), and their three kids Rebecca (Rebekah Brandes), Mary (Jennifer Stone), and Christopher (Carter Cabassa) are currently in the middle of as they relocate to Stull, Kansas where Dan plans on filling in the shoes for the retiring Pastor Kingsman (Clancy Brown). Rebecca suddenly finds herself infatuated with a boy named Noah (Ethan Peck) whose strange behavior only seems to intrigue and attract her to him even more. Soon Rebecca starts having bizarre yet vivid dreams and Mary comes down with an illness that she can't seem to get rid of. As Mary's condition begins to worsen, it becomes clear that the town of Stull has chosen this family as a sacrifice for a ritual they've performed many times before.Glancing at the Blu-ray cover for ""Nothing Left to Fear,"" you expect another run of the mill direct-to-DVD horror film when in fact the film may be a bit more detrimental to the horror genre than it leads on. From the very beginning you can detect shades of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""The Wicker Man,"" but then the film ventures off into unexplored territory. Take a minute to let that soak in. A horror movie that isn't foreign, didn't get a wide theatrical release, and that mostly went undetected by just about everyone until now actually offers something fresh that we haven't seen recycled over and over again in the cookie cutter horror that gets dropped into theaters every year. This should be like winning the lottery for horror fans, but ""Nothing Left to Fear"" has a bitter, dissatisfying, and clunky center that it's never able to overcome.You notice little details as the story progresses. Rebecca's dreams, especially the sheep dream, are fairly extraordinary. The cinematography is particularly well done for a film that was seemingly just dropped onto movie shelves. The camera work seems to flourish most out in open spaces; out in the trees or climbing stairs to a tower in the middle of nowhere. There is this brilliant transition at the end of the film involving the sun and the sky that literally bridges the big climactic sequence to the final scene in the film.Mary's transformation is the big selling point though. The special effects are very touch and go, which you'll either find surprisingly decent or completely loathe with really no middle ground in between. The blackness that seeps through the ground and every surface Mary touches is interesting to watch at times, but kind of confusing. It takes on several different shapes and consistencies; sometimes being like a mist or rolling fog, other times it's a thick liquid like tar, and finally it's like a living shadow that absorbs everything it touches. Some of the creature effects are practical that include prosthetics, but most of it is very obviously computer animated and looks a little cheap at times.Regrettably though, ""Nothing Left to Fear"" isn't able to follow through with the potential it's only able to slightly tinker with rather than completely molding it into something of its own. Nothing in the film is explained very well. While it's easy to piece a few things together as they happen (there's a possession and a demonic transformation after all), you comprehend more after reading the summary on the back of the Blu-ray cover than you do after watching the entire film. The cast also seems to mostly be a waste. Anne Heche, other than showing fear in a single scene, otherwise delivers a disposable performance. While Clancy Brown is mostly forgettable despite usually being one of the highlights of any project he chooses to be a part of.There's a uniqueness to ""Nothing Left to Fear"" that gets your hopes up, but by the time it's over the metaphorical throat of those hopes has been slit from ear to ear. The film seems to make a mockery of you as you figuratively bleed out and a new song from Slash plays over the end credits. ""Nothing Left to Fear"" can't just take pride in being a bad horror film. It tries to pull the ol' switcheroo on its audience and even throws in a few tasty leads including an impressively monstrous creature you're unable to predict, a fascinating story that seems to be taking a new and untraveled path, and surreal yet beautiful visuals. But the trail eventually runs very cold very fast and all you're left with is your limp manhood in your hand and no satisfaction.Special features on the Blu-ray include audio commentary from Producer/Composer Slash, Composer Nicholas O' Toole, and director Anthony Leonardi III and a 16-minute Behind the Scenes featurette that mostly focuses on Slash, the cast, and producers having conversations about discovering the town to shoot the film in, securing the cast, finding a director, and the creature effects.",2,An original vision that succumbs to nothingness,1381363200,"10 10,

1665110,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B00E8A0O3Q,Kane's Review,"[4, 6]","When I first saw this movie on the shelf at Best Buy I said to myself ""Great. Another possession film."" but out of curiosity, I picked it up and read the plot of the film on the back and it actually didn't sound that bad. So I decided to check out Amazon reviews before buying it and seeing how many mixed reviews there were, I decided the only way to truly know for myself is to buy it. It came in the mail today and I was actually impressed with it.Pastor Dan has is relocating from big city to small town with his wife, Wendy and 3 kids Mary, Rebecca, and Christopher to the town of Stull, Kansas where Dan is scheduled to replace retiring pastor Kingsman at the local church. Rebecca ends up be-friending one of a very strange local, whom she becomes very close with, very quickly. Before long, Rebecca is haunted by vivid, paranormal visions and Mary comes down with a strange sickness that gets worse over time. The family soon realizes that they were ""selected"" by the town of Stull to be sacrificed to ""close the gate"" that will prevent Satan from taking over the world. One night at the town's Summer Festival, Mary has her drink drugged and is kidnapped by a townsman and taken to be sacrificed, which is where it all starts.The effects for Mary's possession were so-so but because this is not the highest budgeted of movies, I didn't expect it. From the time Mary's body is possessed, only her family can save her from the evil that awaits them but even they may not be enough to stop the inevitable from happening.Right off the bat, I want to say that this is not your typical possession film. Yes it does revolve around a female who has been possessed by a demon, but the overall story of the movie is what makes it different from the 80 other possession films you could find. Unlike other possession films, Nothing Left To Fear gives off a ""You're on your own"" vibe, leaving the family to fight their own battle whereas all the others commonly involve a priest, bibles, crucifixes, holy water, etc. You'll find none of that here. Just a good plot with semi-decent effects that overall make for a pretty decent movie.The film also features the song Nothing Left To Fear by Slash and Myles Kennedy in the credits, which is a very addicting song that can take anyone in with its mellow yet spine tingling vibe",4,There Will Be Nothing Left To Fear,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",2013,2320,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'shelf', 'Best', 'Buy', 'said', 'myself', 'Great', 'possession', 'film', 'curiosity', 'picked', 'up', 'read', 'plot', 'film', 'back', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'bad', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'buying', 'seeing', 'how', 'many', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'were', 'decided', 'only', 'way', 'truly', 'know', 'buy', 'came', 'mail', 'today', 'was', 'actually', 'impressed', 'it.Pastor', 'Dan', 'relocating', 'big', 'city', 'small', 'town', 'wife', 'Wendy', '3', 'kids', 'Mary', 'Rebecca', 'Christopher', 'town', 'Stull', 'Kansas', 'where', 'Dan', 'scheduled', 'replace', 'retiring', 'pastor', 'Kingsman', 'local', 'church', 'Rebecca', 'up', 'be-friending', 'one', 'very', 'strange', 'local', 'whom', 'very', 'close', 'very', 'quickly', 'long', 'Rebecca', 'haunted', 'vivid', 'paranormal', 'visions', 'Mary', 'down', 'strange', 'sickness', 'worse', 'time', 'family', 'soon', 'were', 'selected', 'town', 'Stull', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'close', 'gate', 'will', 'prevent', 'Satan', 'taking', 'over', 'world', 'One', 'night', 'town', 'Summer', 'Festival', 'Mary', 'drink', 'drugged', 'kidnapped', 'townsman', 'taken', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'where', 'starts.The', 'effects', 'Mary', 'possession', 'were', 'so-so', 'not', 'highest', 'budgeted', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'time', 'Mary', 'body', 'possessed', 'only', 'family', 'can', 'save', 'evil', 'even', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'stop', 'inevitable', 'happening.Right', 'off', 'bat', 'want', 'say', 'not', 'typical', 'possession', 'film', 'Yes', 'revolve', 'female', 'who', 'been', 'possessed', 'demon', 'overall', 'story', 'movie', 'what', 'different', '80', 'other', 'possession', 'films', 'could', 'find', 'other', 'possession', 'films', 'Nothing', 'Left', 'Fear', 'off', ""'re"", 'own', 'vibe', 'leaving', 'family', 'fight', 'own', 'battle', 'others', 'commonly', 'involve', 'priest', 'bibles', 'crucifixes', 'holy', 'water', 'etc', ""'ll"", 'find', 'none', 'here', 'Just', 'good', 'plot', 'semi-decent', 'effects', 'overall', 'make', 'pretty', 'decent', 'movie.The', 'film', 'also', 'song', 'Nothing', 'Left', 'Fear', 'Slash', 'Myles', 'Kennedy', 'credits', 'very', 'addicting', 'song', 'can', 'take', 'anyone', 'mellow', 'yet', 'spine', 'tingling', 'vibe']",N/A

1665112,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00E8A0O3Q,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[0, 0]","I normally avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I've decided to include a handful in this one because I'd like to be very clear about why I think you shouldn't watch this movie. I'll list the spoilers in the order they occur in the film, so if you don't want to read any major plot points, you can get about halfway down the list and still be fine. Otherwise, if you also hate spoilers, go read another review.The plot concerns a young pastor and his perfect family as they move to a new town in rural Kansas where he will be taking over as the town preacher as the current, older man of God finally retires. Unfortunately, this very spiritual town harbors an evil secret that will threaten the lives of our fresh-faced newcomers.PROBLEM #1 -- CHARACTERS: The characters in this film are little more than mannequins. Only the exiting pastor has anything approaching a personality. The new family is so flawless and cutesy and filled with aw-shucks playfulness that they don't seem real. They're about as bland as they could get without being called Characters 1 through 5. The oldest daughter, Rebecca, begins to get hints that something is off about the town when she befriends local heartthrob, Noah, who's main character trait is that he occasionally stares off into space with a sullenly weird expression on his face. Noah's definitely a looker (you can tell -- especially by his voice -- that actor Ethan is related to Gregory Peck), but he's a one-note character as well.PROBLEM #2 -- PACING: For a movie where you have some idea of what to expect, the movie takes its sweet time, relying on cheesy dream segments and misleading musical cues to make it seem like scary things are happening for the first hour of the film. Aside from this, nothing really goes on other than a bad piece of cake and a wayward tooth.PROBLEM #3 -- ONE SCARY IDEA: The movie is about a gate that exists in the town that must be closed. But first, it must be opened. Huh? The youngest daughter, Mary, is &#34;chosen&#34; by a pastry to be the one who is possessed, and so she is drugged, abducted, and tied to a post while the pastor opens the gate and allows the girl to be possessed. This includes the same scary effect that you've seen in nearly every cheesy horror movie or fake-out scream clip on YouTube where you think you're watching kittens or something and then a ghoul jumps out at you. Dark eyes, overlong jaw, dark mouth. This is the movie's only scary card, and it plays it over and over and over.PROBLEM #4 -- LAZY WRITING: Nothing about this ritual is explained. Why it exists, how it started, what it means ... people keep saying &#34;the gate must be closed!&#34; but it seems a whole lot like they were the ones who opened it. Any specific details about the back story are dismissed by the old Pastor Kingsman who simply says, &#34;This is the way things have always been.&#34; This is what I call lazy screenwriting. I don't think films always need to provide answers, but when the crux of your film's plot and basic source of scares is vague, confusing, and filled with complex and unexplained rules, then it becomes more annoying than spooky.PROBLEM #5 -- MAJOR PLOT HOLES CAUSED BY MANIPULATIVE STORYTELLING: When things finally start to get going at around the sixty minute mark, Mary -- possessed by the demon or whatever -- goes around sucking the lifeforce out of her family members while making a sound like a car's slightly-wonky transmission. Rebecca and her little brother, Chris, watch as their dad is turned into ashes before their eyes. Terrified, Noah drives them hastily away as Mary begins to come after them. Then, about a block and a half away, Rebecca demands that Noah stop the car so that she can get out and scream about everything. With a hellspawn approaching her a block and a half away. Everything about this scene was so awkwardly contrived to make things tense, that it was just another nuisance. I could picture the writer thinking, &#34;I don't want them to get away from the demon so easily. Should the car stall? Should the demon have super speed? No. Those are cheesy and lame. I've got an idea! I'll have the blonde spaz out and demand to yell on the street instead of while they escape! For no reason!&#34;This is followed by one of the weirdest plot holes, wherein the demon catches up to them, Chris runs out of the car to find refuge in a house, and Rebecca and Noah run BACK to the car, and drive off, leaving Chris stranded even though they all had plenty of time to escape together. I don't know about you, but when characters abandon an eight year old boy to a demon for no reason, it tends to cast them in a negative light. This, of course, was done solely to make things creepier and to show how the whole town is callously in on the murder of this one family, but it's shoehorned stupidly into the script. So stupidly that, a minute after Noah nearly escapes the demon, Noah and Rebecca are shown driving back to where they left Chris. Yeah. They abandoned him and then decided, &#34;Wait. What are we, monsters? Let's go back. Oops. He's cornered by that demon thing.&#34;PROBLEM #6 -- PREDICTABILITY: The script doesn't try to do anything new or unique with its story, which is never fully fleshed out anyway. But the so-called &#34;twist&#34; that the movie tries to employ at the ending is so dumb and obvious (and actually a little full of itself), that it's the last in a long line of painful eye rollers.I picked up this flick to watch it because I found it on what I thought was a reputable list of &#34;Best Scary Movies of 2013 That You've Never Heard Of,&#34; but I now think there is a reason I never

1665113,AAPT0IT4F8ABH,B00E8A0O3Q,Matthew Scott Baker,"[5, 9]","I had no idea Slash from Guns `N Roses had started a production company until I received his first release in the mail last week.  This film, NOTHING LEFT TO FEAR, intrigued me from the start, especially when it mentioned Stull, Kansas.  The urban legends around Stull have fascinated me for a long time, and this newest addition to the canon is a welcome one.  The film itself is a great debut, and any horror fan should be proud to have it in their collection.I love the simplicity of the story in this film.  I think that's part of what makes the movie so creepy to me; granted, it's a somewhat familiar storyline, but there are enough unique elements here to garner your attention.NOTHING LEFT TO FEAR is shot well and has a truly creepy feel to it.  This feeling conveys well onscreen and transfers quickly to the audience.  I particularly like the locale in which the film is shot; it is not Stull, but rather a small town in Louisiana.  The any-town USA vibe that it gives off, however, cannot be ignored.The acting is good and the special effects are nice, although there were way too many CG effects and not enough practical.

However, it could have been a much better movie if they had actually included other parts of the legend. Stull, Kansas over the past couple of centuries has been notorious for nefarious, creative, and frightening tales that are associated with the town and it's people. Having read many of the tales, I expected at least a few of them to make their way into the movie. However, none of them were in it. They made a passing mention of the Gates of Hell, however, the characters never even attempted to explain anything regarding the town or it's traditions. The only excuse they give for their actions is that it's ""God's will"", and it's for the good of all man. That being said, the acting was decent, the effects were as expected and good, however, the story was quite boring at times.

1665127,A1Q3GEO516I4VK,B00E8A0O3Q,Twisted Slasher,"[2, 3]","It's not often that a movie outright pisses me off.  I see a lot of bottom-of-the-barrel movies for some odd reason, but very few of them make me outright angry for watching them.Nothing Left To Fear made me angry.  I think the biggest reason why is the movie actually starts off well, has likable characters (at first), establishes a good Christian community (at first), looks good and has decent actors.  If the film actually made better use of the people in the main family and continued with being a Christian horror film, it probably could have been good.The problems start when Rebecca (one of the two not-so-teenage daughters) starts having weird dreams.  There turns out to be no reason for her to have these dreams except for perhaps plot convenience and cheap foreshadowing.Second, the story centers around a ritual the town has to perform every once in a while (annually?  bi-annually?  whenever Clancy Brown gets bad vibes?  who knows).  This wouldn't be a bad thing if it ever became clear what the details of the ritual were.  In a good horror story like the video game Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly, the details are very clear: One twin sister has to kill the other twin to appease the god of the village and to keep it from coming out and killing everyone.  Simple, scary and to the point, right?Here, there never seems to be any clear reasoning behind the ritual, except that it's ""God's will.""  Moreover, the ritual is centered around which family member eats a piece of cake with a demon tooth in it.  I wish I were making that up.  Anyway, so the person who eats the tooth-cake (Rebecca's sister Mary) is the chosen one for the ritual, and is subjected to being impregnated by a demon residing in a well.  After a bit of time, the possessed family member then has to go around killing all the non cake-eating members of the family, except for one remaining member, whose blood is then used in the same well to draw the demon back into it for another period of time.  I'm not sure if it matters which family member lives or not, but if it did, the movie never addresses it. Actually, what would have happened if one of the family members turned out to be adopted?  Would the ritual have failed miserably then?As soon as the hell starts breaking loose in the film, the two most likable characters in the family are immediately killed off in unspectacular fashion.  Soon after, the audience is treated to Rebecca abandoning her kid brother Christopher to her demon sister, basically leaving him to die.  In the next scene, she is not seen as distraught, or even concerned, about her brother being in danger.  This scene is particularly horrible because Christopher was the smart one begging Rebecca and her boyfriend to not stand and argue outside the car while a homicidal demon is approaching, and instead do the smart thing and drive far, far away from the demon.So yes, after this scene Rebecca becomes incredibly hateable, and that's bad news because of course she's the main character.  So when it gets to that, what's the point of even caring anymore?  The ending of the movie plays in predictable fashion and the final scene shows the cycle of the ritual will continue; in fact, it's basically a repeat of a similar scene shown earlier in the film.  So there's no good payoff, no lessons learned, and no point to watching Nothing Left to Fear.",2,"The longer the movie goes on, the worse it gets",1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,3371,"['not', 'often', 'movie', 'outright', 'pisses', 'see', 'lot', 'bottom-of-the-barrel', 'movies', 'odd', 'reason', 'very', 'few', 'make', 'outright', 'angry', 'watching', 'them.Nothing', 'Left', 'Fear', 'made', 'angry', 'think', 'biggest', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'actually', 'off', 'well', 'likable', 'characters', 'first', 'good', 'Christian', 'community', 'first', 'good', 'decent', 'actors', 'film', 'actually', 'made', 'better', 'use', 'people', 'main', 'family', 'continued', 'being', 'Christian', 'horror', 'film', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good.The', 'problems', 'start', 'when', 'Rebecca', 'one', 'two', 'not-so-teenage', 'daughters', 'having', 'weird', 'dreams', 'out', 'be', 'reason', 'have', 'dreams', 'perhaps', 'plot', 'convenience', 'cheap', 'foreshadowing.Second', 'story', 'centers', 'ritual', 'town', 'perform', 'once', 'while', 'annually', 'bi-annually', 'whenever', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'bad', 'vibes', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'ever', 'became', 'clear', 'what', 'details', 'ritual', 'were', 'good', 'horror', 'story', 'video', 'game', 'Fatal', 'Frame', '2', 'Crimson', 'Butterfly', 'details', 'are', 'very', 'clear', 'One', 'twin', 'sister', 'kill', 'other', 'twin', 'appease', 'god', 'village', 'keep', 'coming', 'out', 'killing', 'everyone', 'Simple', 'scary', 'point', 'right', 'Here', 'never', 'be', 'clear', 'reasoning', 'ritual', 'God', 'will', 'Moreover', 'ritual', 'centered', 'family', 'member', 'piece', 'cake', 'demon', 'tooth', 'wish', 'were', 'making', 'up', 'Anyway', 'person', 'who', 'tooth-cake', 'Rebecca', 'sister', 'Mary', 'chosen', 'one', 'ritual', 'subjected', 'being', 'impregnated', 'demon', 'residing', 'well', 'bit', 'time', 'possessed', 'family', 'member', 'then', 'go', 'around', 'killing', 'non', 'cake-eating', 'members', 'family', 'one', 'remaining', 'member', 'blood', 'then', 'used', 'same', 'well', 'draw', 'demon', 'back', 'period', 'time', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'family', 'member', 'lives', 'not', 'did', 'movie', 'never', 'Actually', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'one', 'family', 'members', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'adopted', 'Would', 'ritual', 'have', 'failed', 'miserably', 'then', 'As', 'soon', 'hell', 'breaking', 'loose', 'film', 'two', 'most', 'likable', 'characters', 'family', 'are', 'immediately', 'killed', 'off', 'unspectacular', 'fashion', 'Soon', 'audience', 'treated', 'Rebecca', 'abandoning', 'kid', 'brother', 'Christopher', 'demon', 'sister', 'basically', 'leaving', 'die', 'next', 'scene', 'not', 'seen', 'distraught', 'even', 'concerned', 'brother', 'being', 'danger', 'scene', 'particularly', 'horrible', 'Christopher', 'was', 'smart', 'one', 'begging', 'Rebecca', 'boyfriend', 'not', 'stand', 'argue', 'car', 'homicidal', 'demon', 'approaching', 'instead', 'do', 'smart', 'thing', 'drive', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'demon.So', 'yes', 'scene', 'Rebecca', 'incredibly', 'hateable', 'bad', 'news', 'course', 'main', 'character', 'So', 'when', 'what', 'point', 'even', 'caring', 'anymore', 'ending', 'movie', 'predictable', 'fashion', 'final', 'scene', 'cycle', 'ritual', 'will', 'continue', 'fact', 'basically', 'repeat', 'similar', 'scene', 'shown', 'earlier', 'film', 'good', 'payoff', 'lessons', 'learned', 'point', 'watching', 'Nothing', 'Left', 'Fear']",N/A
