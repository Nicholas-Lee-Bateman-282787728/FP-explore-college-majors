515142,AXKLJRDTPJCA7,B00002ND7R,Boss Fan,"[57, 57]","I have seen Tom Petty and the boys live many times and I'm a naturalist fan - that is, I don't just like the hits and often feel the overlooked stuff is better or as good as the standards.  Petty and Co. make great albums, but where they shine is live, so when I say this is the best of the live DVDs I am basing that on three things.  1)The accuracy to which it captures a true Heartbreakers show, 2)How many times one would watch/listen to it and 3) should anyone other than Petty die-hards need apply.First, the performance takes place at the Filmore which is a theatre/club.  This does not allow the band to play as they do in arenas, but the whole thing works.  There is energy, but also a intimate feel - very nice.  It also does what good concert DVDs should do and makes the viewer feel, if not like they are there, at least what it must have been like to be there (to be fair, this is an eassier feat given the club setting vs, say, a stadium).  This also reminded me of Petty's hilarious performance on VH1's Storytellers from around the same time.  Anything that makes me think of that is aces in my book (if only that were on DVD).The songs are great and great to hear live.  Since there is no recent live Petty album this can double as such.  The opening one-two punch of ""Jammin' Me"" and ""Runnin' Down a Dream,"" kicks ass!  This how a show I saw on that tour began and as far as I'm concerned its how every show should begin.  And while we're talking about it, this version of ""Jammin' Me"" is so good it gave me a new found respect for a song that always seemed like an oddity in the Heartbreakers stash.  Don't get me wrong, it rocks (love Mike's guitar and the more agressive vocal from Tom), but it doesn't jive well inserted with their hits - chronologicly it falls somewhere between ""Don't Come Around Here..."" and ""Free Fallin',"" but its not just that; it feels rather 80s-ish, whereas most of their other singles have more of a timeless feel.  But here the tune is loose, loud, and we are having fun watching it because the boys are having fun playing it.  We also get great songs from the underrated ""Echo,"" and thank God for some tracks from ""She's the One.""  There is something of a lull just before the encores where they play at least one too many slow songs in a row, but they soon ralley for a set of rockers, including a harder ""You Wreck Me.""There are of course too many Petty Hits to fully include them all here so some may be bummed their favorite song didn't make the cut, but that alomst goes without saying for any long-running act at a live show; that's the way it goes, but what is here is all done so well, the set feels complete.Second, I have had this since it came out in fall of '99.  I'm writing the review now because I am watching it again, as I do often.  It doesn't get old and DVD is great cause you can jump right to the ""Jammin' Me's"" and the ""Mary Jane's"" of the set.  I use it as much as a live album to listen to as I do a concert to watch.  I wish it were available on CD.And thirdly, fans, and I obviously am one, won't be disapointed; and non-fans may just be converted.  The guys had their A-Game on this night.I have seen some reviews complaining about the filming; cuts, shakiness, etc...  I may have comented on that myself way back when, but I honestly haven't thought twice about it.  In my opinion its neither a plus or a minus.The other Petty DVDs are good as well, but this is the only one that depicts a typical live show.  The Soundstage one is filled with covers and light on Heartbreakers hits (which isn't a bad thing, I rather enjoy hearing some of that stuff, but its from PBS so there is a slow, artsy-fartsiness to the whole thing) and ""Live at the Olympic"" is a run-through of the ""Last DJ"" album cover to cover with 5 or so bonus past hits at the end as encores.  I like ""Last DJ,"" but many didn't.  If you are one of those, skip that DVD.Regardless, this Filmore one would be the one to have anyway.

515143,A3NTNZJXQRN7QE,B00002ND7R,Bruce P. Barten,"[0, 3]","I am evaluating this as a small part of an old Tom Petty collection.  I wish more of my music collection was on DVD so I had more opportunity to see who was producing the music, and how it was done.  On this DVD, the guitar solo by Bo Diddley while Tom Petty is singing ""Mona"" is filmed well enough to convince me that Bo Diddley was doing plenty of notes, even when he wasn't singing.  Musically, I was trained to understand Mozart and his ilk, a standard selection of melodic phrases that sound like a single composer always had the tune in mind, so I am amazed that Tom Petty can sing that song like it has a tune, which it does, but in a blues idiom that never sticks in my mind firmly enough to whistle, while there is so much else going on.There is some audience interaction, with Tom telling the crowd, ""I have to sing a song right now,"" when some introduction gets some of the people excited enough for Tom to feel it, too.  2003 might be a big year for me to witness how people recover from mistakes.  The beginning of ""Even the Losers,"" (selection 11) starts with a nice guitar part, but the first verse wasn't perfect, so it went into a few attempts, and a lot of the trouble seem to fall on expecting any one person to accomplish so much within a short period of time.  Music can be great when it is simple, but Tom Petty is the kind of creative genius who would rather startle people with something way beyond whatever was expected.  Anticipation is such a large part of appreciating his music that ""The waiting is the hardest part"" became a favorite line in the video ""Pack Up the Plantation.""  That was a long time ago, and I might not like anything that has been recorded since 1999 as much as I liked ""Needles and Pins,"" an old tune that was a big reason I bought ""Pack Up the Plantation"" as a double LP before discovering that it wasn't on the Plantation video.  What is great in ""Needles and Pins"" was ""I saw her face, it was a face I loved.""  I think people who listen to music feel that way so often that I'm surprised how often I had to ask myself, *whose face was that?* before I knew that only four of the faces in this DVD concert were older versions of people on the ""Pack Up the Plantation"" tour.""Jammin' Me"" is not one of my favorite songs, but it names enough people to show what kind of society we live in, in a way that might even hurt, if people don't know what you're doing.  Tom Petty found a way of using people's names in his song ""Swingin' "" that must have been new in 1999, but which I seem to emulate in a lot of reviews.  Sonny Liston and Benny Goodman went down swinging to different beats, and too many of my reviews have come out like ""Mary Jane's Last Dance.""  I don't think people should make up their mind about that song by the weird video that introduced it to MTV viewers.  This performance reduces the song to its musical elements, and this kind of DVD is best for people who are most curious about how they do that on a musical level.  It's not creepy when they are just singing it.  People who freaked out ought to lighten up already.",4,"Like real life, good enough for DVD",1044057600,"02 1, 2003",2003,3086,"['am', 'evaluating', 'small', 'part', 'old', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'collection', 'wish', 'more', 'music', 'collection', 'was', 'DVD', 'had', 'more', 'opportunity', 'see', 'who', 'was', 'producing', 'music', 'how', 'was', 'done', 'DVD', 'guitar', 'solo', 'Bo', 'Diddley', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'singing', 'Mona', 'filmed', 'well', 'enough', 'convince', 'Bo', 'Diddley', 'was', 'doing', 'plenty', 'notes', 'even', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'singing', 'Musically', 'was', 'trained', 'understand', 'Mozart', 'ilk', 'standard', 'selection', 'melodic', 'phrases', 'sound', 'single', 'composer', 'always', 'had', 'tune', 'mind', 'am', 'amazed', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'can', 'sing', 'song', 'tune', 'blues', 'idiom', 'never', 'sticks', 'mind', 'firmly', 'enough', 'whistle', 'so', 'much', 'else', 'going', 'audience', 'interaction', 'Tom', 'telling', 'crowd', 'have', 'sing', 'song', 'right', 'now', 'when', 'introduction', 'people', 'excited', 'enough', 'Tom', 'feel', 'too', '2003', 'might', 'be', 'big', 'year', 'witness', 'how', 'people', 'recover', 'mistakes', 'beginning', 'Even', 'Losers', 'selection', '11', 'nice', 'guitar', 'part', 'first', 'verse', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'went', 'few', 'attempts', 'lot', 'trouble', 'seem', 'fall', 'expecting', 'one', 'person', 'accomplish', 'so', 'much', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'when', 'simple', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'kind', 'creative', 'genius', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'startle', 'people', 'something', 'way', 'was', 'expected', 'Anticipation', 'such', 'large', 'part', 'appreciating', 'music', 'waiting', 'hardest', 'part', 'became', 'favorite', 'line', 'video', 'Pack', 'Up', 'Plantation', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'anything', 'been', 'recorded', '1999', 'as', 'much', 'liked', 'Needles', 'Pins', 'old', 'tune', 'was', 'big', 'reason', 'bought', 'Pack', 'Up', 'Plantation', 'double', 'LP', 'discovering', 'was', ""n't"", 'Plantation', 'video', 'What', 'great', 'Needles', 'Pins', 'was', 'saw', 'face', 'was', 'face', 'loved', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'listen', 'music', 'feel', 'way', 'so', 'often', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'how', 'often', 'had', 'ask', '*whose', 'face', 'was', '*', 'knew', 'only', 'four', 'DVD', 'concert', 'were', 'older', 'versions', 'people', 'Pack', 'Up', 'Plantation', 'tour', 'Jammin', 'Me', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'songs', 'names', 'enough', 'people', 'show', 'what', 'kind', 'society', 'live', 'way', 'might', 'even', 'hurt', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'found', 'way', 'using', 'people', 'names', 'song', 'Swingin', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'new', '1999', 'seem', 'emulate', 'lot', 'reviews', 'Sonny', 'Liston', 'Benny', 'Goodman', 'went', 'down', 'swinging', 'different', 'beats', 'too', 'many', 'reviews', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'Last', 'Dance', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'people', 'should', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'song', 'weird', 'video', 'introduced', 'MTV', 'viewers', 'performance', 'song', 'musical', 'elements', 'kind', 'DVD', 'best', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'most', 'curious', 'how', 'do', 'musical', 'level', 'not', 'creepy', 'when', 'are', 'just', 'singing', 'People', 'who', 'freaked', 'out', 'ought', 'lighten', 'up', 'already']",N/A

It's not flashy, it's just your straight-forward concert with strong performances from many stops along his illustrious career. He lets each of his bandmates deliver their performances without gimmicks and without over-production. The guitar work by Mike Campbell is stellar as you would expect from Petty's co-captain. The rest of the hearbreakers deliver as well.This is a great DVD for either the casual Petty fan, or the die-hard. As the years go by, I find myself listening to Tom Petty (and the Heartbreakers) more and more, and appreciating his writing and musicianship and understated singing more and more as well.Tom is like a comfortable garment that just fits better and better and gets more comfortable with each wearing. No disrespect intended here, please understand, I think Petty is a genius. He has grown over the many years he has been entertaining us into something greater than we imagined possible.There are some good performances on this disc, and some great performances. ""Jammin' Me"", ""Swingin'"" ""Mary Jane's Last Dance"" and ""You Wreck Me"" are all incredible performances, caught forever on this DVD for repeated viewing and listening.

The concert has a good mix of old and new tracks and shows how tight the band are and Mike Campbells great guitar work. If you're looking for a Tom Petty Live album and are unsure what one to go for, I'd say this is a good place to start. Love the music, love the band, loved the DVD.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",5,Great Live Performance,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,424,"['Tom', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'playing', 'good', 'honest', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'concert', 'good', 'mix', 'old', 'new', 'tracks', 'how', 'tight', 'band', 'are', 'Mike', 'Campbells', 'great', 'guitar', 'work', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'Live', 'album', 'are', 'unsure', 'what', 'one', 'go', ""'d"", 'say', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'Love', 'music', 'love', 'band', 'loved', 'DVD.Feel', 'free', 'check', 'out', 'blog', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'profile', 'page']",N/A
