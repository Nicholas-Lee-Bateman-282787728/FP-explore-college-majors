1444399,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0056YMDVE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","I guess when it comes to holiday programming, you could say that I'm fairly old fashioned.  The classics that I grew up with when there weren't as many television options became yearly traditions--by familiarity, if not always quality.  Today, with hundreds of stations to select from, kids can be more choosy.  And yet, I'm still rarely blown away by the options presented.  When Dreamworks, therefore, adopted two of its film franchises into new Halloween spectaculars--I was a bit skeptical.  The original ""Shrek"" was one of my all time beloved movies although the series was beginning to show wear, while ""Monsters vs Aliens"" may have had its moments but it wasn't a particular favorite of mine.  I was, therefore, pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed these two brief specials.  ""Scared Shrekless"" and ""Monsters vs Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins From Outer Space"" can be purchased individually, but certainly qualify as a better deal in a combination pack if you want both.  Note:  These aired as 30 minutes specials with commercials--so approximate running times are about 22 minutes each if that makes a difference in your buying choice.In ""Monsters vs Aliens:  Mutant Pumpkins From Outer Space,"" Susan (Reese Witherspoon) and her team of wacky cohorts are now government operatives.  Near Halloween, an alien presence is detected in Susan's hometown and the crew is dispatched.  While everything appears calm, soon innocent jack-o-lanterns are revealed to be nefarious aliens with a cunning plot to take over the world.  Fast and funny, with plenty of gourd guts, this showdown is well orchestrated and gives every member of the team a chance to shine.  The addition of Susan's family adds some amusement--obviously, their little girl isn't so little anymore.  Fun for the little ones, it is still engaging to older audiences with sly references to Gremlins, Psycho, Halloween and other genre classics and in-jokes.  Truthfully, I enjoyed this twenty-two minutes of mayhem more than I did the entire feature film.  By cutting out the extraneous plotting, they've devised a tight and economical comedy special that really delivers and has heart as well.

I was just lamenting the fact that I couldn't find it being broadcast on my local stations this Halloween Season. But now! Here it is.If you liked the original movie, this holds all of the fun, light thrills and goofy comedy as the original. All the characters are present and a few more. The Mstant Pumpkins are hilarious, growing bigger and stronger by eating Halloween candy.This is only a 22 minute TV Show, so don't be disappointed by the short length. It was originally just aired on TV. But its worth it. Not too scary but not The Great Pumpkin kind of tame.

This would make a great seasonal family film for the kids as it lacks the traditional frightening features of traditional movies at this time. The movie starts out with aliens accidentally mutating pumpkins in Modesto, by disposing of their waste. The monsters are called on to save the world. The mutant pumpkins eat candy.Most of the humor is geared toward the younger crowd, with only a few jokes that only mom and dad might get. ""If they give you candy, they are human.
