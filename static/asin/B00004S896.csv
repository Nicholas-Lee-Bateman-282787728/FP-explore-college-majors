John LaR was just fine, seeming to grasp the importance of Lost in Space to its fans. he also seemed to blend in with the inside humour.I would have liked to have seen some outtakes, but you can't have it all.As stated by another, the colour was great. Seeing Guy Williams doing the interview was very enlightening to me. He's been described as a 50's/60's George Cluny. Bull! He is an Errol Flynn if there ever was one, and that screen test mkaes him seem more akin to Flynn in that cocky way. Cluny does not have the features of those two, nor could he be considered a looker at all, in comparison.To see Johnathon Harris have some fun again was great. At the time of the 1997 movie he was asked if he did a cameo in the film. His answer was, ""Cameos? We do not do cameos!""Mumy actually seemed like a kid again, which is strange for all  the growing up he had to do. He was fine.All of the interviews were much appreciated, but a tad too short.Watching this made me decide to get all of the DVD's of the three seasons, but I am going to wait to see if there is a package of all of them when the second half of the third season hits.

549454,A2Z65D8FBYDY63,B00004S896,Donald J. Wurzelbacher,"[34, 38]","It seems a shame that such an enjoyable series has often been treated so poorly overall. The main problem with this retrospective is that John Laroquette, who has nothing at all to do with ""Lost in Space"" is our host. It's also a shame that many other cast members from the original series did not make an appearance on this special.... Perhaps it was a way to remind folks about the theatrical version which was mostly a flop at the box office.I enjoy watching ""Lost in Space"" and so as a viewer it would have been great to see the original cast members sitting down discussing the show and interesting tidbits that went on while showing clips from the series. Unfortunately, that's not what happened.The most enjoyable part of the DVD in my opinion was seeing Will, Dr. Smith and the robot together in character at the end. It was a short scene, but it did show that nobody missed a beat with their characters even after all these years.The ""Bonus Footae"" became quite boring after awhile. Unfortunately there was no sound and it was just long, overly-extended scenes of the cyclops giant, the chariot, and the Jupiter 2. However, the bonus of Guy Williams being interviewed by Irwin Allen was indeed worth watching. The third bonus of getting the set together for the Jupiter 2 when Will, the robot, and Dr. Smith do their final skit at the end of the show was also a treat.If you enjoy ""Lost in Space"", this is one of the few specials you can find on the subject so it's the best we can do. I have heard that the DVD called 'The fantasy worlds of Irwin Allen' is a better retrospective of the series. ...BR>Finally, with the recent death of Jonathan Harris, it is nice to see his final appearance as Dr. Smith captured forever.

549455,A28B47KE7UJDZH,B00004S896,e1x56u$*w#,"[15, 16]","After reading the many lukewarm reviews here, I didn't have very high expectations for this DVD of a 1998 documentary produced in part to hype the Lost In Space motion picture released around that time. But after hearing that there was one last scene on here with the 1960s Dr. Smith and Will Robinson in character circa 1998, I knew I HAD to have this.Turned out the documentary itself wasn't half as bad as I had been dreading. In fact I'd say overall it's pretty decent. Yeah, so John Laroquette is irrelevant to LIS, but I've seen many other documentaries hosted by people equally unrelated to their subject matter (--hell, Bill Mumy himself sometimes acts as host of Biography). At least Laroquette wasn't particularly irritating here like he could have been.Maybe if you're a hardcore LIS fan who has read every book and article available on the subject, then there probably won't be much new here for you. But as someone who always enjoyed the show but hasn't really gotten into the fandom side of things, this documentary was just right for me and I picked up many a new fact here and there (eg.: John ""Star Wars"" Williams did the music for LIS too? I did not know that. And the guy who did the robot's voice was a completely different person from the one inside the suit? I did not know that either.)It was great seeing the remaining cast members as they looked in 1998 and finding out what they had been doing during all the years since.  I also found this documentary very useful when trying to educate friends brand new to the classic LIS with more background info on the show. It really helps to show them how important this show is to many people (yes, I am NOT a freak for liking this!), and why. After watching this, they are not quite so dismissive of the show and are more willing to try and give it a chance.Bonus material includes the original network promo presentation for potential advertisers (now also available on one of the LIS TV show DVDs), some SFX footage they shot of the giant cyclops for the show's pilot (I was surprised it was in colour. Did they shoot all the B & W shows in colour first?), and Guy Williams' screen test for Irwin Allen to get the part of Prof. John Robinson (my squeaky-clean image of Prof. Robinson is forever destroyed thanks to a moment when Williams seems intent on revealing to Irwin Allen the tender young age he lost his virginity at. Gah!)But the real highlight here is of course the scene with Will and Dr. Smith. Both actors deliver their lines as convincingly as if they had just walked off the 60s set, and the Jupiter II mock-up they are in looks quite authentic too. The scene is over in a brief couple of minutes and the ending is a little silly, but I have to say it was really great just to get one final glimpse of them. It will be the last, unfortunately, due to the death of Jonathan Harris just months after. I really wish they had done more like this and sooner, but I guess something is better than nothing....So for me, this disc was the perfect way to complete my LIS DVD collection. Just like the extra disc included especially for the fans in the Space 1999 DVD Megaset, it adds that last little something extra that's really nice to have. I think that this is one of those obscure titles that will be highly sought-after by fans after it goes out of print, so grab it while you can.(--And for any people reading this from the DVD-making biz, howsabout releasing the episode of the 80s gameshow ""Family Feud"" that they mention in this documentary, where the cast of LIS were guests? I'd buy that!)",5,I liked it.
