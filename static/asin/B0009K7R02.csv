This transfer to DVD is ok and the picture does appear to be cropped somewhat, but it's not severe, and does not ruin the presentation. Some of the episodes are real treats and the lessons are as relevant today as they were in the 70's. I enjoyed this as a boy and now my son enjoys it as well. I definitely recommend all three of the seasons if you enjoy eastern mysticism or martial arts.",5,A forgotten treat.,1174780800,"03 25, 2007",2007,544,"['When', 'was', 'younger', 'would', 'watch', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'upper', 'UHF', 'channels', 'even', 'boy', 'loved', 'story', 'Caine', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'ok', 'picture', 'appear', 'be', 'cropped', 'somewhat', 'not', 'severe', 'not', 'ruin', 'presentation', 'episodes', 'are', 'real', 'treats', 'lessons', 'are', 'relevant', 'today', 'were', '70', 'enjoyed', 'boy', 'now', 'son', 'as', 'well', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'three', 'seasons', 'enjoy', 'eastern', 'mysticism', 'martial', 'arts']",Kung Fu - The Complete First Three Seasons

We both loved to watch the reruns of Kung Fu when we were youner and we still love watching them together. The quality is as good as I remember them to be. (not up to today's standards) but good enough. I imagine these were low budget productions originally.

907130,A6T098A9B0GZC,B0009K7R02,"Robbi Dobbi ""Quality, Value, Community!""","[14, 14]","Not only will you enjoy the full three-season run, which includes the 2-hour pilot show, but there are many special features, interviews, and extras throughout the three seasons. Being older, wiser, one tends to see the little guffaws in wardrobe, mis-matched stand-ins and crew members getting into the shot. In one such scene Caine is fighting a man (the actor's stand-in) and the man is seen standing idly by watching ""himself"" fight Caine. Too Funny. The temple scenes are the greatest value to me. Yes, they guzzied up the old ""castle"" from Camelot to make it look like a Chinese Buddhist temple, but it looks great anyway. One thing I caught though that is historically inaccurate, Carradine is always talking about the Tao, and so are his masters, even quoting Lao Tzu in many cases. However, Lao Tzu would have been a contemporary of the Shaolin sect and his writings would not have been widely published so that monks would use his quotes as ""sage wisdom"". Also, Shaolin was a Ch'an (Zen in Japanese)Buddhist temple, and would not have had an interest in Lao Tzu or Taoism. That notwithstanding, I highly recommend these for anyone who enjoys Asian culture, Taoism, martial arts, etc. Everyone can find something within this series, and within themselves that they didn't know existed previously.

907131,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,B0009K7R02,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[10, 12]","The concept of the series is of a quiet humble man who avoids action at almost any cost... Caine (David Carradine) was taught a good soldier is not violent, a fighter is not angry, and a victor is not vengeful...Caine runs a long way with a price on his head for murder... He comes to the American West where he travels the countryside facing many pillars of violence... He effectively inspires the character with infrequently found qualities for an action hero: grace and self-control, suppleness and rhythmic endurance, speed and patience, tenacity and power...For several years in the Shaolin Temple, Caine learns to exercise and develop his inner strength... He learns to make powerful the force of his body... Yet he was taught to reverence all against whom he may use such force... He comes to know how weakness prevails over strength, how gentleness conquers, how he seeks victory in contention...With an emphasis on Buddhist philosophy, ""Kung Fu"" is a morality play, a magic show, combining the Western genre with martial arts...",4,"""What happens in a man's life is already written...
