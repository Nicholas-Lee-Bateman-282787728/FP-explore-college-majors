481113,A62G4QX6XQVLP,6305847118,Anyechka,"[6, 6]","I really enjoyed this film, which provides a fascinating outlet into the private world of John and Yoko in 1971 during the making of one of his most famous solo albums (and which is probably tied with W&B; as my second-favorite solo album of his, second only to POB).  However, it is disappointing to find out that a lot of the footage actually came from other videos which have already been released.  For people who don't know that or who haven't seen these other films yet, that's not going to be a really big or important concern, but for those who do know better, it is somewhat misleading and deceptive.  What's the point in taking a bunch of recycled footage and padding it out with some new stuff while passing it off as an entirely new product?The video as it stands, however, is a delight to behold.  Even though I would have liked seeing a lot more footage of the making of 'Imagine,' the scenes that are there are fantastic, showing what went on behind the scenes.  We see John doing rough takes, cursing out the other musicians because they're not doing things right, playing back what he just recorded, changing parts of the songs, all of the usual things that musicians do while making an album but which their fans usually don't get to be privy to.  We also see footage of John and Yoko around their house, relaxing and having fun together, meeting with celebrity friends, and talking to fans.  John explains to one of these fans that he's just a regular guy and isn't special or a demigod just because he's a musician, that most of the time he's singing about his own life, not anyone else.  If a fan can relate his songs to one's own life, that's one thing, but it's not as though he deliberately wrote these songs because he felt the pain and life experiences of people he's never met.  The John we see here is such a multifaceted human being, more proof of why he's the person I admire most.  He could be funny, sweet, sarcastic, angry, brutally honest, gentle, tender, silly, and professional, and all of those sides of him just made him a flawed human being like any other person.There's also an interview with John and Yoko included as a bonus feature.  They're talking about love, sex, and relationships, in a very honest and realistic way.  Although some people might not like some of their views, if one looks honestly at society and reality, there can be no denying that all of the things they say in this interview are true.  For example, celebrities using sex appeal to sell their movies or music is nothing new and has been going on for ages.  One can have love without sex and sex without love.  How high one's hemline is or what age one became sexually active at isn't something that should assume great importance when one thinks about serious issues in the world, like hunger and war.  Many times people throw up minor issues like that to deflect responsibility away from dealing with the harder things.  People might strategically cover up a picture of naked people because they don't want kids to see that, but that just sends a message that the human body and sexuality are shameful, unnatural, and disgusting, and as John said, he and all of his friends had already seen dirty pictures and heard stories about sex by the time they were eight years old anyway.  This was a really insightful interview, even though some people might be off-put by what they're saying.All in all, I'd recommend this disc, but only if you haven't already seen the other videos that a lot of this footage was pulled from.  I agree that this does kind of straddle the fence between the casual viewer, who might not be interested in it, and the hardcore fan, who will want it regardless but be disappointed because it contains so much footage from other films.",4,Somewhat misleading,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,3774,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'fascinating', 'outlet', 'private', 'world', 'John', 'Yoko', '1971', 'making', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'solo', 'albums', 'probably', 'tied', 'W', 'B', 'second-favorite', 'solo', 'album', 'second', 'only', 'POB', 'However', 'disappointing', 'find', 'out', 'lot', 'footage', 'actually', 'came', 'other', 'videos', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'released', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'films', 'yet', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'really', 'big', 'important', 'concern', 'who', 'do', 'know', 'better', 'somewhat', 'misleading', 'deceptive', 'What', 'point', 'taking', 'bunch', 'recycled', 'footage', 'padding', 'out', 'new', 'stuff', 'passing', 'off', 'entirely', 'new', 'product', 'video', 'however', 'delight', 'behold', 'Even', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'seeing', 'lot', 'more', 'footage', 'making', ""'Imagine"", 'scenes', 'are', 'are', 'fantastic', 'showing', 'what', 'went', 'scenes', 'see', 'John', 'doing', 'rough', 'cursing', 'out', 'other', 'musicians', ""'re"", 'not', 'doing', 'things', 'right', 'playing', 'back', 'what', 'just', 'recorded', 'changing', 'parts', 'songs', 'usual', 'things', 'musicians', 'do', 'making', 'album', 'fans', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'be', 'privy', 'also', 'see', 'footage', 'John', 'Yoko', 'house', 'relaxing', 'having', 'fun', 'together', 'meeting', 'celebrity', 'friends', 'talking', 'fans', 'John', 'one', 'fans', 'just', 'regular', 'guy', ""n't"", 'special', 'demigod', 'just', 'musician', 'most', 'time', 'singing', 'own', 'life', 'not', 'anyone', 'else', 'fan', 'can', 'relate', 'songs', 'one', 'own', 'life', 'one', 'thing', 'not', 'deliberately', 'wrote', 'songs', 'felt', 'pain', 'life', 'experiences', 'people', 'never', 'met', 'John', 'see', 'here', 'such', 'multifaceted', 'human', 'being', 'more', 'proof', 'why', 'person', 'admire', 'most', 'could', 'be', 'funny', 'sweet', 'sarcastic', 'angry', 'brutally', 'honest', 'gentle', 'tender', 'silly', 'professional', 'sides', 'just', 'made', 'flawed', 'human', 'being', 'other', 'person.There', 'also', 'interview', 'John', 'Yoko', 'included', 'bonus', 'feature', ""'re"", 'talking', 'love', 'sex', 'relationships', 'very', 'honest', 'realistic', 'way', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'views', 'one', 'honestly', 'society', 'reality', 'can', 'be', 'denying', 'things', 'say', 'interview', 'are', 'true', 'example', 'celebrities', 'using', 'sex', 'appeal', 'sell', 'movies', 'music', 'nothing', 'new', 'been', 'going', 'ages', 'One', 'can', 'have', 'love', 'sex', 'sex', 'love', 'How', 'high', 'one', 'hemline', 'what', 'age', 'one', 'became', 'sexually', 'active', ""n't"", 'something', 'should', 'assume', 'great', 'importance', 'when', 'one', 'serious', 'issues', 'world', 'hunger', 'war', 'Many', 'times', 'people', 'throw', 'up', 'minor', 'issues', 'deflect', 'responsibility', 'away', 'dealing', 'harder', 'things', 'People', 'might', 'strategically', 'cover', 'up', 'picture', 'naked', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'kids', 'see', 'just', 'message', 'human', 'body', 'sexuality', 'are', 'shameful', 'unnatural', 'disgusting', 'John', 'said', 'friends', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'dirty', 'pictures', 'heard', 'stories', 'sex', 'time', 'were', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'anyway', 'was', 'really', 'insightful', 'interview', 'even', 'people', 'might', 'be', 'off-put', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying.All', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'disc', 'only', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'other', 'videos', 'lot', 'footage', 'was', 'pulled', 'agree', 'kind', 'straddle', 'fence', 'casual', 'viewer', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'interested', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'who', 'will', 'want', 'regardless', 'be', 'disappointed', 'so', 'much', 'footage', 'other', 'films']","Gimme Some Truth - The Making of John Lennon's ""Imagine"""
481114,A3NUA12GI8OFU1,6305847118,Colin Klein,"[55, 56]","As with almost every archival Beatles-related release, this is another product that tries to straddle the line of being for the collector and the casual fan both (leaving neither really happy with the end result). Once again they have erred on the favor of the casual fan, who will not be the  one buying the majority of this release. Capitol/EMI never seem to learn  from the great bootlegs how to compile really good releases.If you have  Imagine (the videos film), and Imagine (the documentary film), and Yoko Ono  Then and Now, and the John Lennon videos collection, then you already have  more of THIS video than you SHOULD have. The NEW stuff in this video is  GREAT! Where is the rest of it? I could have gone for way more recording  scenes, this hardly shows George playing, no King Curtis, no Badfinger.  Just enough to tease us, then back to more recycled footage. Obviously  these people filmed everything they did almost all the time, so why do we  have to keep seeing the same scenes over and over again in each (NEW?)  product. I am all for putting things in context, but the old stuff makes  the basis for this dvd, not the new stuff. Just enough is left out of each  product that you have to buy all of them, but once you have them it's  pretty redundant. Of course the casual fan is not going to care because  they will only see one of the versions, but for the rest of us this is  getting really old. They also took the cheap way out and left in all the  dust, hairs, scratches, and streaks in the video too, rather than cleaning  it up like Yellow Sub. And, unlike Yellow Sub, the 5.1 soundtrack is not  that big of a deal musically, and not that sonically different from the cd  remaster.The extra interview is nice, since they went out of their way  to make that complete. I just wish as much thought would have gone into the  main feature. Do you need this? Yes. If it's the only Lennon video you  have, you'll probably be pretty happy, and it's much better than the videos  version Imagine. If you have all the others, you still need this because  there is just enough new to re-sell you the old again.",4,geared to the casual fan AGAIN,957225600,"05 2, 2000",2000,2125,"['almost', 'archival', 'Beatles-related', 'release', 'product', 'straddle', 'line', 'being', 'collector', 'casual', 'fan', 'leaving', 'really', 'happy', 'end', 'result', 'Once', 'again', 'have', 'erred', 'favor', 'casual', 'fan', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'buying', 'majority', 'release', 'Capitol/EMI', 'never', 'seem', 'learn', 'great', 'bootlegs', 'how', 'compile', 'really', 'good', 'releases.If', 'have', 'Imagine', 'videos', 'film', 'Imagine', 'documentary', 'film', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'Then', 'Now', 'John', 'Lennon', 'collection', 'then', 'already', 'have', 'more', 'THIS', 'video', 'SHOULD', 'have', 'NEW', 'stuff', 'video', 'GREAT', 'Where', 'rest', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'more', 'recording', 'scenes', 'hardly', 'George', 'playing', 'King', 'Curtis', 'Badfinger', 'Just', 'enough', 'tease', 'then', 'back', 'more', 'recycled', 'footage', 'Obviously', 'people', 'filmed', 'everything', 'did', 'almost', 'time', 'so', 'why', 'do', 'have', 'keep', 'seeing', 'same', 'scenes', 'over', 'again', 'NEW', 'product', 'am', 'putting', 'things', 'context', 'old', 'stuff', 'basis', 'dvd', 'not', 'new', 'stuff', 'Just', 'enough', 'left', 'product', 'have', 'buy', 'once', 'have', 'pretty', 'redundant', 'course', 'casual', 'fan', 'not', 'going', 'care', 'will', 'only', 'see', 'one', 'versions', 'rest', 'getting', 'really', 'old', 'also', 'took', 'cheap', 'way', 'left', 'dust', 'hairs', 'scratches', 'streaks', 'video', 'too', 'rather', 'cleaning', 'Yellow', 'Sub', 'Yellow', 'Sub', '5.1', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'musically', 'not', 'sonically', 'different', 'cd', 'remaster.The', 'extra', 'interview', 'nice', 'went', 'way', 'make', 'complete', 'just', 'wish', 'as', 'much', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'main', 'feature', 'Do', 'need', 'Yes', 'only', 'Lennon', 'video', 'have', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'pretty', 'happy', 'much', 'better', 'videos', 'version', 'Imagine', 'have', 'others', 'still', 'need', 'just', 'enough', 'new', 're-sell', 'old', 'again']","Gimme Some Truth - The Making of John Lennon's ""Imagine"""

A small amount of the footage has been seen on the 1988 theatrical release of IMAGINE,  however, those parts are greatly expanded upon in this DVD.  The sound is  incredible to listen to in 5.1 surround sound especially with headphones on  as I am listening to it now.  It truly makes you feel as if you are hearing  the CD for the first time and the video only makes you appreciate the songs  even more.  The only negative portion is when Lennon seems extremely  impatient during the background vocals of OH YOKO.  His temper is soaring  and Phil Spector looks as if he would rather be somewhere else.  However  this is important to see because it shows that creating art is not an easy  task and keeping your temper intact is a tough one to master even by this  master.

481118,A1WYIDGR8ZG21X,6305847118,Thomas Lapins,"[2, 2]","I was pleased to see a grammy go to &quot;Gimme Some Truth&quot;. If you remember, at the 1981 grammys, John and Yoko won a grammy for &quot;Double Fantasy&quot;. Good to hear the names John Lennon and Yoko Ono at a grammy awards show. Lennon's &quot;Imagine&quot; and Harrison's &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; were the two solo Beatles LP's I played the most. &quot;Imagine&quot; (the LP) was tender and cutting, and now to see the making of the DVD documentary &quot;Imagine&quot; I better understand Lennon's mood at the time: tense and terse then suddenly tender, ready to rip apart a technician for screwing up something or other, then an ocean of gentleness. If you loved John and Yoko, as millions of us did, this takes you inside their world, behind the hype and media veils created by their music and persona. You can't hide for long when the camera's eye is following your every move. John and Yoko loved their media events, this documentary falls into that category, thirty years later. The events of December 8, 1980 give a heightened perspective to this footage. It's really interesting to see the faces of so many studio players I've only heard in passing or on LP jackets. It's interesting to see how Yoko is dismissed by many of the session players. She has to be extra assertive to make her point (it unfortunately has taken the public thirty years to catch up with this brilliant woman). As a young man John and Yoko were the only two who made any sense to me, and I treasure seeing their music and relationship on DVD.
