I think we all have a little OCD in us.,5,Monk - Season One,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",2013,128,"['what', 'can', 'say', 'Monk', 'nuts', 'watching', 'so', 'funny', 'think', 'have', 'little', 'OCD']",Monk: Season One
809054,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B0001KL5IU,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 2]","My wife, Jen, likes to wash her hands.  Let me explain further.  Every time we eat, touch a stray cat, lick the trashcans, or just plain hug, she likes to wash those cute little nubbins of hers with anti-bacterial soap.  Strange?  How about this personal story.  Dented cans.  Heard of them?  Well, every time we are at the grocery store, when it comes to the cans, we must inspect, feel, and insure that no dents are hiding for fear of a little disease known as botulism.  These are the things I love the most, but I wouldn't call them crazy - to her face at least.  With these little idiosyncrasies in place, we have been itching to see a TV series that has been awarded several accolades through its already planned six seasons, aptly titled ""Monk"".  It is a simple show, or at least the first season is, in which a highly intelligent detective overcomes his phobias (as far ranging as they are) to solve crimes and give us the classic ""Scooby-Doo"" ending, where Monk typically pulls the mask of some unsuspecting criminal.  As stated before, this is a simple show, not your run-of-the-mill ""CSI"" where bodies co-exist with blood and scantily clad women, this is more along the PG rated level, but please, don't be discerned, this is smarter, funnier, and more exciting than Grissom saying, ""There is always a clue"".  In my eyes, there is always a Monk.Tony Shalhoub, who typical stands behind the leading man in most films, takes helm of this originally small series, and transforms it into a masterpiece.  He masters the mannerisms of someone that may be experiencing the phobias and compulsions that do exist in the modern world.  Alas, he at times does over-push the limits, but it works because it isn't some big name star trying to outwit himself each time.  There is a heart to Shalhoub's character, which, in my eyes, makes for better watching than gritty realism.  This first season doesn't even begin to scratch the surface on the possibilities that Monk has in store for us.  What brings this series into full swing, and pulls the viewer closer to Monk is the unknown of his past.  Through each episode we are given small nibbles of the past; how he lost his wife, the birth of his condition, and his reasoning for being discharged from the force.  We grow with this in the first episode, and it only gets better in time ... I mean with each episode.If I were to complain, it would be a very small two - meaning I only have two small issues with the show.  The first being the change of structure from the original premiere.  Originally, we didn't see the culprit until the very ending, allowing Monk to bask in the glow of his own discoveries - I liked this opportunity.  It allowed me to solve the clues with Monk and see if his eyes were similar to mine.  The second has to do with continuity, and I feel that this may be an issue with my own personal preference, but I would have liked to have smaller sub-plots which would have led to a surprising cliffhanger of a season finale.  I loved the story of Monk and his lost wife, but I wanted more to do with this, more meat to go with the potatoes of the show.  There was one episode, ""Mr. Monk meets Dale the Whale"" in which we are given a glimpse of the darkness surrounding the events leading to Monk's wife's death, but that is it.  It was almost as if that episode went too far, and afterwards they pulled back too quickly.  Again, those were small issues compared the the impressiveness of this first season.  It has plenty of room to grow, and I think each of our main central characters, Disher, Stottlemeyer, and even Sharona will continue to impress as we grow with them.Overall, I am eager (yet, oddly, not jumping) to begin the next season.  I wanted a stronger finisher than what was presented, but with ""Monk"" it isn't about the bells and whistles, it is about solving crimes and overcoming obstacles that maybe are normal challenges in our lives.  The bombardment of celebrity involvement near the end (Willie Nelson, Amy Sedaris, and Tim Daly) only shows the growth and popularity that this program was already beginning to see near the end of the first season.  Again, I am excited, but not ""Lost"" excited about our next season.  I want to see ""Monk"" grow - it has the potential - let's see if the creators take it to that next level.Keyboards kinda gross - Monk would be disappointed.Grade: **** out of *****",4,"Monk rubs the lotion on his hands, as Stottlemeyer would say!",1178928000,"05 12, 2007",2007,4392,"['wife', 'Jen', 'wash', 'hands', 'Let', 'explain', 'further', 'Every', 'time', 'eat', 'stray', 'cat', 'lick', 'trashcans', 'just', 'plain', 'hug', 'wash', 'cute', 'little', 'nubbins', 'hers', 'anti-bacterial', 'soap', 'Strange', 'How', 'personal', 'story', 'Dented', 'cans', 'Heard', 'Well', 'time', 'are', 'grocery', 'store', 'when', 'cans', 'must', 'inspect', 'feel', 'insure', 'dents', 'are', 'hiding', 'fear', 'little', 'disease', 'known', 'botulism', 'are', 'things', 'love', 'most', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'crazy', 'face', 'least', 'little', 'idiosyncrasies', 'place', 'have', 'been', 'itching', 'see', 'TV', 'series', 'been', 'awarded', 'several', 'accolades', 'already', 'planned', 'six', 'seasons', 'aptly', 'titled', 'Monk', 'simple', 'show', 'least', 'first', 'season', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'detective', 'phobias', 'far', 'ranging', 'are', 'solve', 'crimes', 'give', 'classic', 'Scooby-Doo', 'ending', 'where', 'Monk', 'typically', 'mask', 'unsuspecting', 'criminal', 'stated', 'simple', 'show', 'not', 'run-of-the-mill', 'CSI', 'where', 'bodies', 'co-exist', 'blood', 'scantily', 'clad', 'women', 'more', 'PG', 'rated', 'level', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'discerned', 'smarter', 'funnier', 'more', 'exciting', 'Grissom', 'saying', 'always', 'clue', 'eyes', 'always', 'Monk.Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'who', 'typical', 'stands', 'leading', 'man', 'most', 'films', 'helm', 'originally', 'small', 'series', 'masterpiece', 'mannerisms', 'someone', 'may', 'be', 'experiencing', 'phobias', 'compulsions', 'do', 'exist', 'modern', 'world', 'Alas', 'times', 'over-push', 'limits', ""n't"", 'big', 'name', 'star', 'trying', 'outwit', 'time', 'heart', 'Shalhoub', 'character', 'eyes', 'better', 'watching', 'gritty', 'realism', 'first', 'season', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'scratch', 'surface', 'possibilities', 'Monk', 'store', 'What', 'series', 'full', 'swing', 'viewer', 'closer', 'Monk', 'unknown', 'past', 'episode', 'are', 'given', 'small', 'nibbles', 'past', 'how', 'lost', 'wife', 'birth', 'condition', 'reasoning', 'being', 'discharged', 'force', 'grow', 'first', 'episode', 'only', 'better', 'time', 'mean', 'episode.If', 'were', 'complain', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'small', 'two', 'meaning', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'small', 'issues', 'show', 'first', 'being', 'change', 'structure', 'original', 'premiere', 'Originally', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'culprit', 'very', 'ending', 'allowing', 'Monk', 'bask', 'glow', 'own', 'discoveries', 'liked', 'opportunity', 'allowed', 'solve', 'clues', 'Monk', 'see', 'eyes', 'were', 'similar', 'mine', 'second', 'do', 'continuity', 'feel', 'may', 'be', 'issue', 'own', 'personal', 'preference', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'smaller', 'sub-plots', 'would', 'have', 'led', 'surprising', 'cliffhanger', 'season', 'finale', 'loved', 'story', 'Monk', 'lost', 'wife', 'wanted', 'more', 'do', 'more', 'meat', 'go', 'potatoes', 'show', 'was', 'one', 'episode', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Dale', 'Whale', 'are', 'given', 'glimpse', 'darkness', 'surrounding', 'events', 'leading', 'Monk', 'wife', 'death', 'was', 'almost', 'episode', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'afterwards', 'pulled', 'back', 'too', 'quickly', 'Again', 'were', 'small', 'issues', 'compared', 'impressiveness', 'first', 'season', 'plenty', 'room', 'grow', 'think', 'main', 'central', 'characters', 'Disher', 'Stottlemeyer', 'even', 'Sharona', 'will', 'continue', 'impress', 'grow', 'them.Overall', 'am', 'eager', 'yet', 'oddly', 'not', 'jumping', 'begin', 'next', 'season', 'wanted', 'stronger', 'finisher', 'what', 'was', 'presented', 'Monk', ""n't"", 'bells', 'whistles', 'solving', 'crimes', 'overcoming', 'obstacles', 'maybe', 'are', 'normal', 'challenges', 'lives', 'bombardment', 'celebrity', 'involvement', 'end', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'Tim', 'Daly', 'only', 'growth', 'popularity', 'program', 'was', 'already', 'beginning', 'see', 'end', 'first', 'season', 'Again', 'am', 'excited', 'not', 'Lost', 'excited', 'next', 'season', 'want', 'see', 'Monk', 'grow', 'potential', 'let', 'see', 'creators', 'take', 'next', 'level.Keyboards', 'kinda', 'gross', 'Monk', 'would', 'be', 'disappointed.Grade', '****', '*****']",Monk: Season One

809062,A1YB29BIDULEYE,B0001KL5IU,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[0, 0]","I received this as a gift recently. If you're on this page, you probably already know that this is about a detective who has many gifts of observation, but he is also plagued with tragic limitations that prevent him from functioning on his own. (Or for that matter from doing what he does officially for the police dept of San Francisco.)What makes this show so great is that there is a WONDERFUL chemistry between the 4 main characters. Monk is lovable (if also annoying). But he does the best he can with what he has despite his limitations. It is also refreshing to see a hero who is flawed and has limitations, but does his best. Stottlemeyer is a great voice of reason. He often reminds us of the painful truth that Monk can't function on his own, but even if he hurts us with this truth, he is right. And while harsh at times, he is usually fair. And he is certainly not without compassion at times.Sharona is GREAT as Monk's nurse and helper. She works for him and is compassionate. But yet she is not afraid to tell him to cut something out. And to add to the comedy, sometimes the right looking guy distracts her from her duties. Disher is also great. He is the young cop who is eager to please his boss. And sometimes he messes up. BUT, other times he really comes through. In ""The Billionaire Mugger,"" Disher (with extreme courage) tackles an armed man.I like the pilot. A bodyguard of the candidate for mayor is killed. Is the candidate for mayor in danger, or is this part of another picture? ""Mr. Monk and the Psychic"" is a great episode where the eccentric Monk convinces his friends that the well connected police commissioner probably killed his wife. ""Dale the Whale"" is an interesting episode. How could an 800 man who can't leave his bed have performed an act of murder miles away?Moving on there is a creepy  episode that takes place at an amusement park. Could a cop have really killed someone there? The evidence says yes. But Stottlemeyer knows better. I didn't much like where Monk goes to the asylum.  ""Mr. Monk and the Other Woman"" is a great episode where Monk explores the possibility of falling in love again. But is the woman he finds attractive guilty of murdering several people?""Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger"" is a great episode full of comedy and suspense. It also explores some bounced check issues between Monk and Sharona. ""The Marathon Man"" was another episode I didn't like at all. Sorry. But then I really enjoyed ""Mr. Monk takes a Vacation."" That was an interesting episode where Monk is 'somewhat enjoying' his vacation with Sharona, but yet there is a murder at the resort. Sharona is understandably annoyed at her vacation being interrupted. But Monk finds a valuable ally in the spunky female detective at the hotel.""The Earthquake"" is a great episode where we meet Sharona's sister, and Sharona finds herself fighting her sister over a nice guy. (But is he a little too nice?) ""The Red Haired Stranger"" was another episode I have to admit I didn't like at all. In the 12th and final episode, Monk deals with an interesting case where someone murdered a woman and 'took her place.' It wasn't my favorite episode but I like how the defeated villain had to offer Monk a bit of respect.Overall 3 episdoes I did NOT like at all. 1 so so episode. And the other 8 were great. So overall, I'd say it's a good package.Another thing this series does well is that for the most part, it avoids being too funny. As funny as this series gets, there are several moments of sadness that prevent the series from becoming a farce. And perhaps the best thing about this show is the chemistry. We know that all 4 characters need each other.

When I read of some of the other actors that were considered for this role, I just shudder. This brilliant show that has entertained us for several years now would most likely have gone down the tubes after a few shows with someone like Michael Richards in the role. He would have overplayed Monk's idiosyncrasies to the point that they would have become tiring to the audience VERY quickly. With Tony, they are a constant backdrop that provide just the right balance of comedy, sympathy for his problems, and dramatic device on occasion.The show is quite well acted, and the mysteries are solid. I find very little in the way of plot holes, and normally I can find enough of those in a mystery show or movie to make it look like Swiss cheese!

809065,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0001KL5IU,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[0, 0]","One of the more clever television creations of the new millennium, Monk combines the high-grade suspense of a traditional TV drama with the quirky humor of a big screen comedy. Originally developed for ABC, the show became an instant prime-time lynchpin for the USA network, proving itself one of the more successful shows on cable TV...In Monk, Tony Shalhoub stars in the title role of Adrian Monk, a former San Francisco detective placed on psychiatric leave. A true legend in the community, Monk solves unsolvable crimes via his towering intellect, photographic memory, and meticulous observations. But the one case that alludes Monk is the 1997 murder of his wife Trudy, which forever altered Monk's capacity to perform his job. Suffering from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder and a number of odd phobias, Monk requires a personal assistant, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram), for even his most basic daily activities. Yet Monk remains a police consultant on difficult cases, and he hopes to persuade Capt. Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) to give him his old job back. But Stottlemeyer and colleague Lt. Randall Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford), harbor doubts about Monk's mental faculties. As Monk solves cases though, those doubts dissipate and Stottlemeyer and Disher learn to appreciate Monk's special talents - despite his inability to cope with the day-to-day activities of a normal detective... Nevertheless, he remains a de facto investigator as he and Sharona aid the San Francisco police department in solving numerous high profile cases...The Monk (Season 1) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Mr. Monk and the Candidate"" in which the audience first learns the background of Adrian Monk, a modern day Sherlock Holmes beset by mental problems. After Monk solves a mysterious murder simply by looking at the crime scene, Capt. Stottlemeyer enlists him to help in the investigation of a failed assassination attempt of mayoral candidate Warren St. Claire...Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger"" in which Monk investigates the death of a billionaire shot while trying to mug a police officer, and ""Mr. Monk and the Earthquake"" in which Monk investigates the murder of a wealthy businessman (which occurred during an earthquake) while suffering verbal difficulties as a result of the earthquake's numerous aftershocks...Below is a list of episodes included on the Monk (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (Mr. Monk and the Candidate: Part 1)Episode 2 (Mr. Monk and the Candidate: Part 2)Episode 3 (Mr. Monk and the Psychic)Episode 4 (Mr. Monk Meets Dale the Whale)Episode 5 (Mr. Monk Goes to the Carnival)Episode 6 (Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum)Episode 7 (Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger)Episode 8 (Mr. Monk and the Other Woman)Episode 9 (Mr. Monk and the Marathon Man)Episode 10 (Mr. Monk Takes a Vacation)Episode 11 (Mr. Monk and the Earthquake)Episode 12 (Mr. Monk and the Red-Headed Stranger)Episode 13 (Mr. Monk and the Airplane)The DVD Report",5,"Truly original, truly hilarious!",1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,3033,"['One', 'more', 'clever', 'television', 'creations', 'new', 'millennium', 'Monk', 'high-grade', 'suspense', 'traditional', 'TV', 'drama', 'quirky', 'humor', 'big', 'screen', 'comedy', 'Originally', 'developed', 'ABC', 'show', 'became', 'instant', 'prime-time', 'lynchpin', 'USA', 'network', 'proving', 'one', 'more', 'successful', 'shows', 'cable', 'TV', 'Monk', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'stars', 'title', 'role', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'former', 'San', 'Francisco', 'detective', 'placed', 'psychiatric', 'leave', 'true', 'legend', 'community', 'Monk', 'unsolvable', 'crimes', 'towering', 'intellect', 'photographic', 'memory', 'meticulous', 'observations', 'one', 'case', 'Monk', '1997', 'murder', 'wife', 'Trudy', 'forever', 'altered', 'Monk', 'capacity', 'perform', 'job', 'Suffering', 'severe', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'number', 'odd', 'phobias', 'Monk', 'personal', 'assistant', 'Sharona', 'Fleming', 'Bitty', 'Schram', 'even', 'most', 'basic', 'daily', 'activities', 'Monk', 'police', 'consultant', 'difficult', 'cases', 'persuade', 'Capt', 'Leland', 'Stottlemeyer', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'give', 'old', 'job', 'back', 'Stottlemeyer', 'colleague', 'Lt.', 'Randall', 'Disher', 'Jason', 'Gray-Stanford', 'harbor', 'doubts', 'Monk', 'mental', 'faculties', 'Monk', 'cases', 'doubts', 'dissipate', 'Stottlemeyer', 'Disher', 'learn', 'appreciate', 'Monk', 'special', 'talents', 'inability', 'cope', 'day-to-day', 'activities', 'normal', 'detective', 'Nevertheless', 'de', 'facto', 'investigator', 'Sharona', 'aid', 'San', 'Francisco', 'police', 'department', 'solving', 'numerous', 'high', 'profile', 'cases', 'Monk', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'number', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Candidate', 'audience', 'first', 'background', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'modern', 'day', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'beset', 'mental', 'problems', 'Monk', 'mysterious', 'murder', 'simply', 'looking', 'crime', 'scene', 'Capt', 'Stottlemeyer', 'help', 'investigation', 'failed', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'mayoral', 'candidate', 'Warren', 'St.', 'Claire', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'include', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Billionaire', 'Mugger', 'Monk', 'death', 'billionaire', 'shot', 'trying', 'mug', 'police', 'officer', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Earthquake', 'Monk', 'murder', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'occurred', 'earthquake', 'suffering', 'verbal', 'difficulties', 'result', 'earthquake', 'numerous', 'aftershocks', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'Monk', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Candidate', 'Part', '1', 'Episode', '2', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Candidate', 'Part', '2', 'Episode', '3', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Psychic', 'Episode', '4', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Meets', 'Dale', 'Whale', 'Episode', '5', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Goes', 'Carnival', 'Episode', '6', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Goes', 'Asylum', 'Episode', '7', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Billionaire', 'Mugger', 'Episode', '8', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Other', 'Woman', 'Episode', '9', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Marathon', 'Man', 'Episode', '10', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Vacation', 'Episode', '11', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Earthquake', 'Episode', '12', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Red-Headed', 'Stranger', 'Episode', '13', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'Airplane', 'DVD', 'Report']",Monk: Season One

But Monk does owe his outstanding deductive reasoning skills to Holmes and, more directly, to Conan Doyle. The only derivative aspect that marks the show is that very skill. That being said, it is easy to forgive the series this fact. Most modern day mystery minded television and literature nods to Conan Doyle and, beyond him, Poe. And when something works so well and so effectively, why change it? It's still just as exhilirating to have Monk point out the origin of a callus on the left forefinger as it was when Rathbone in the guise of Holmes did something quite similar. As far as I'm concerned, it makes for great television (or film, for that matter.)But what's the real reason to watch MONK? Because it is undoubtedly one of the absolute funniest television shows that you will ever hope to watch. In actuality there is nothing humorous about OCD. But the show not being reality, and the intelligence, emotion, and determination behind Monk's character, seem to make it okay to laugh. And laugh you will. Not smile, not chuckle, but full on contagious laughter. The kind that creates a well of euphoria in the pit of your stomach after you've finished. The kind that comes forth again when you recall a particular scene or bit of dialogue the next day. And what's even better is that the comedy inherent in Monk owes nothing to the slapstick that always prompted laughter in &quot;comedies&quot; of the past. It's intelligent and thoughtful. And it's carried off beautifully by Tony Shalhoub.Shalhoub is adorable. He makes you believe in his character and you rally behind him whenever he encounters something he is afraid of. He deserves every accolade he garners for this show. And each of the cast members that surrounds him adds to the overall delight and humor of MONK.I can only hope and cross my fingers that this show will remain on the air for a long time to come. And that they will manage to keep it as fresh and as funny as it is. My suggestion would be to watch the new season--it's even funnier than the first--at the same time as the episodes included in this first season set.

809076,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B0001KL5IU,David Girod,"[2, 2]","Monk's first season is some of the best comedy/drama that has been on TV in years. Tony Shaloub is a gifted actor, and breathes life and believability into the character of Mr. Monk. Monk's daily struggle with OCD is at time funny and because of Tony Shaloub's portrayal, touching. We can see that Monk hates being trapped by his OCD, even if the disease is a contributing factor to his Sherlock Holmesian power of observation. All of the episodes in season one are enjoyable. Watching Monk chase a suspect through a sewer in &quot;Mr. Monk and the Candidate&quot; is hilarious. The interaction between Monk and his nurse/assistant Sharona is fun to watch. In episodes &quot;Mr. Monk takes a Vacation&quot; and &quot;Mr. Monk and the Airplane&quot;, the back and forth between the characters is a riot. I think the highlight of this box set is &quot;Mr. Monk and Red Headed Stranger&quot;. Some of the subtle jokes about Willie Nelson are great!! And the ending of that episode is very touching. Ted Levine, the actor who played the serial killer in &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; plays Detective Stottlemeyer (sp?), and is really good at playing the straight man to Monk.If you enjoy mysteries, that don't involve shoot outs and soap opera (NYPD Blue), or mysteries that don't just pander to the geriatric set (Diagnosis Murder &amp; Matlock), then Monk is for you.

But no other is as quirky as Adrian Monk, the obsessive-compulsive detective.And the first season of ""Monk"" succeeds in bringing an odd twist to the traditional detective TV show. Tony Shalhoub shines as everyone's favorite obsessive-compulsive detective, solving the case with his gift/curse and his willingness to go anywhere... that doesn't have germs.Adrian Monk's wife Trudy was killed in a car-bombing, and the devastated detective fell apart completely and had to leave the police force. Years later, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is partially recovered, but he still is obsessive-compulsive and has dozens of phobias. The only way he manages is with his assistant Sharona (Bitty Schram) babysitting him.When a politician is nearly killed in a mystery shooting, the police are baffled. So Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) reluctantly calls in his old pal to solve the case. From then on, Monk is called in for dozens of bizarre, baffling cases. His excellent memory and his OCD (""It's a gift.... and a curse"") allow him to see patterns and details where other people see nothing.The cases that follow are no less confounding -- Monk must deal with a supposed psychic, a grotesquely obese financier who is unable to get out of bed, a stabbing on a Ferris wheel, a murder in an asylum, a billionaire mugger, a marathon alibi, a vacation gone wrong, an earthquake, a date, a murderous Frenchman, and a murder seemingly committed by Willie Nelson.""Monk"" is the sort of show that usually gets cancelled after five episodes -- it's well-written, amusing, and smart. So by TV standards, the fact that it lasted even one season -- let alone several -- is nothing short of miraculous. The first season is not quite the best, but it's a thoroughly solid basis for this comedy/mystery series.There are gunfights and pperwork, like on any cop show, but the main focus here is on detecting. And the writers are skilled at coming up with all sorts of bizarre or unsolvable crimes, which only Monk could unravel. Not to mention the dialogue, which leans heavily on dry humour (""You've got to be a little skeptical, Sharona. Otherwise you end up believing in everything -- UFOs, elves, income tax rebates..."")But the series wouldn't be what it is without Tony Shalhoub. He played weird roles in movies like MIB and ""Galaxy Quest,"" and so he knows how to balance out Monk's weirdness and genius without leaning too heavily on either. And he does a brilliant job with Monk's devotion to his late wife Trudy, which is so strong and pure that you'd never known years had passed.Schram serves as the Watson to Monk, and her hard-edged New York single mom is a nice foil -- especially since it's her job to keep him in contact with reality. And while Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford seem rather cold to Monk initially, once they warm up they become excellent police counterpoints to Monk, as genial police chief Stottlemeyer and his earnest (if slightly goofy) sidekick Randy Disher.The first season of ""Monk"" is a solid start to a smart, unique comedy/mystery serie, with plenty of unsolvable crimes and strange problems.

Even the so-called ""serious"" dramas, such as ""The West Wing"" and ""ER"" are basically a clumsy piling on of stale platitudes and disease and/or crisis of the week ephemeral plotting. As for ""reality"" shows, I have nothing to say about that sorry genre save that, strangely, I have never been plucked out of my boring life, put on a deserted isle, surrounded by a dozen hot babes while eating worms and maggots, in hopes of working for Donald Trump, should I emerge victorious.Then, all of the sudden, in the Summer of 2002, my wife and I stumbled across this show, ""Monk."" What can I say? ""Monk"" is one of those programs that only comes along every generation or so. It is so gratifying to finally watch a program that mixes light comedy, captivating mystery, taut suspense and intelligent dialogue. Bravo!""Monk"" revolves around its central character, the eccentric savant and super-sleuth, Adrian Monk, played with understated erudition by Tony Shalhoub. Monk, who's been felled by the tragic murder of his beautiful wife, Trudy, has a tough time being reinstated to the San Francisco Police Department because of his Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Half Perry Mason and half Felix Unger, he is a walking library of esoteric information hindered by a thousand phobias.His nurse, gal-Friday and sidekick is the streetwise and sexy Sharona Fleming, who's on hand to help Adrian overcome his OCD and to dispense antibacterial wipes to protect him from viral infection and dangerous human elements after shaking hands. Monk's OCD provides a lot of comedic moments and plot points, but without ever becoming preachy or belittling.Monk and Sharona are definitely television's best couple, even though their relationship is platonic. While he exists almost exclusively in his own cerebral and abstract world, world-wise Sharona provides the intuition to navigate him through the world populated by the rest of humanity. She's also the perfect foil for his awkward personality quirks. Without Sharona, Monk would literally be incomplete.Ted Levine plays Monk's former boss, Captain Stottlemeyer, with gruff aplomb. Reluctantly, he hires Monk free lance as a consultant when the SFPD can't crack the case. Jason Gray-Stanford gives more comic relief as the boyish Disher, an earnest yet somewhat slow-witted detective on the force who would never solve one of Monk's mysteries, even if given 1000 years.In this boxed set are 12 episodes from the first season, including the pilot, ""Mr. Monk and the Candidate,"" so buyers, please, you don't need to buy the pilot episode separately, unless you are a completist with OCD, like Adrian Monk. The best episodes are: ""Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum,"" which features an offbeat guest appearance by Kevin Nealon; ""Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger,""; ""Mr. Monk Takes a Vacation; and, most hilariously, ""Mr. Monk and the Airplane,"" in which our hero manages to annoy all the plane's passengers with his finicky behavior while solving a murder.""Monk"" is superbly cast and brilliantly executed. The photography is gorgeous, the filmstock ripe with rich hues and deep shadows. I disagree with one previous reviewer who implied that the sound ""suffices,"" because it is merely in Dolby 5.1 stereo.

James Franciscus played Mike Longstreet, an insurance investigator, whose beloved wife was killed by the same bomb that blinded him.  This, too, was an excellent (though short-lived) series in which the main character struggled with a disability, even using it to his advantage in solving crimes.  Like Adrian Monk, Mike Longstreet also had a network of caring, multi-skilled friends helping him.  That series was completely serious, though, with none of the quirky humor of MONK.  (Nevertheless, I'd like to have it on DVD, too.)If you know--or live with--someone with compulsions similar to Adrian Monk's, you will watch MONK and smile in recognition...and no little sadness.

809094,A2J6M8AG7RYYEO,B0001KL5IU,Josh Bozeman,"[7, 8]","Monk is one of the best tv series out there- I'd even go further and say, it's one of the best tv series ever.  The writing is brilliant- subtle comedy and some dark humor found throughout every episode...the concept is original- a genius detective with OCD, who battles the disease while trying to solve complex cases for the police...all while trying to get his life back on track to the point where he can rejoin the force.Shaloub is a wonderful actor who does the character of Adrian Monk complete justice.  He's been awarded for his role with an emmy, and it's well deserved.  The rest of the cast are just as wonderful, filling out the areas that Monk can't fill himself very nicely.The series is very professional in it's look- the dp on this series has done a great job...and it really helps that after season 1, they moved actual shooting to San Francisco, instead of the, almost surely, Canadian city they used as a look-alike.The series also has great music, most of the scoring done by the guy who did the original season 1 theme song- a much better version than the dark Randy Newman theme used for season 2 and ever since.There is nothing bad to say about this series- it's always a joy to watch Monk solve the crimes, dealing with his disease, and lauhging along with everything that takes place.  This is the very definition of great television.A note about the DVD itself, and why I would rate the set a 2 or 3 and the show a 5- there's very little here added on.  You would think that a hit series like this would have some commentaries or indepth behind-the-scenes stuff, but all it has is 4 or 5 short behind-the-scenes segments about the show and about the illness and how the creators came up with the idea.  There are no commentary tracks, nor any longer documentary-style segments on the set.  The audio is dolby 5.1, I believe, and it's in letterbox- very nice for both, but I would have liked to see some commentary tracks, and more bonus material- it's a little weak for such a popular series if you ask me.",5,"5 stars for the show, 2 or 3 for the DVD itself",1093046400,"08 21, 2004",2004,2034,"['Monk', 'one', 'best', 'tv', 'series', 'there-', ""'d"", 'even', 'go', 'further', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'tv', 'series', 'ever', 'writing', 'brilliant-', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'dark', 'humor', 'found', 'episode', 'concept', 'original-', 'genius', 'detective', 'OCD', 'who', 'disease', 'trying', 'solve', 'complex', 'cases', 'police', 'trying', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'track', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'rejoin', 'force.Shaloub', 'wonderful', 'actor', 'who', 'character', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'complete', 'justice', 'been', 'awarded', 'role', 'emmy', 'well', 'deserved', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'just', 'wonderful', 'filling', 'out', 'areas', 'Monk', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fill', 'very', 'nicely.The', 'series', 'very', 'professional', 'look-', 'dp', 'series', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'really', 'season', '1', 'moved', 'actual', 'shooting', 'San', 'Francisco', 'instead', 'almost', 'surely', 'Canadian', 'city', 'used', 'look-alike.The', 'series', 'also', 'great', 'music', 'most', 'scoring', 'done', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'original', 'season', '1', 'theme', 'song-', 'much', 'better', 'version', 'dark', 'Randy', 'Newman', 'theme', 'used', 'season', '2', 'ever', 'nothing', 'bad', 'say', 'series-', 'always', 'joy', 'watch', 'Monk', 'solve', 'crimes', 'dealing', 'disease', 'lauhging', 'along', 'everything', 'place', 'very', 'definition', 'great', 'television.A', 'note', 'DVD', 'why', 'would', 'rate', 'set', '2', '3', 'show', '5-', 'very', 'little', 'here', 'added', 'would', 'think', 'hit', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'commentaries', 'indepth', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stuff', '4', '5', 'short', 'behind-the-scenes', 'segments', 'show', 'illness', 'how', 'creators', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'are', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'longer', 'documentary-style', 'segments', 'set', 'audio', 'dolby', '5.1', 'believe', 'letterbox-', 'very', 'nice', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'more', 'bonus', 'material-', 'little', 'weak', 'popular', 'series', 'ask']",Monk: Season One

Little did I know what I was missing.Tony Shalhoub stars as Adrian Monk, a former police detective no longer on the force because of his obsessive-compulsive disorder and his phobias.  He does still consult on some of their most bizarre cases, however.  For example, how could an 800-lb. man commit murder?  Why was a billionaire killed while mugging a man on a date?  Did a fellow airline passenger really kill his wife?  How could a man commit murder and run a marathon at the same time?This series falls into the classic puzzle mystery genre, my personal favorite.  Sometimes I have an idea why or how, but it takes the ending for me to know for sure.  More often then not, I'm stumped.  Along the way, we get plenty of laughs at the various situations we find Mr. Monk in.  The obsessive-compulsive disorder and his fears are handled just right.  They provide the clues needed and humor without being over the top or annoying.Of course, the series is helped by its actors.  Tony Shalhoub is excellent as Monk with a performance just slightly understated.  He deserved his Emmy win for this season.  Just as praise worthy is Bitty Schram as Monk's nurse Sharona.  She mixes exasperated and compassionate while providing a strong sidekick character that doesn't get lost behind the lead.  Ted Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford as the police Monk helps and Stanley Kamel as Monk's shrink are equally excellent.The writing is sharp and manages to find humor without mocking Monk, a subtle but clear distinction.This DVD set is great for old and new fans alike.  All twelve first season episodes are present, including the previously released two-hour pilot.  They're presented in widescreen and look sharp.  The sound, while presented in 5.1 surround, is nothing spectacular.  Still, it gets the job done.  Disc four has some short extras discussing the creation of the show, obsessive-compulsive disorder, the cast and crew's obsessions, the Emmy win, and the casting of Bitty Schram and Ted Levine.  I would have loved a commentary track or two and some outtakes, but they aren't to be found here.While the extras could have been just a tad better, this set is a must have for those who love light mystery.  It was nice to catch the cases I'd missed.  This is one mystery show you can watch time and time again for the humor and character even if you remember how it ends.",5,Off to a Strong Start,1087603200,"06 19, 2004",2004,2444,"['blew', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'watching', 'show', 'second', 'season', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'missing.Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'stars', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'former', 'police', 'detective', 'no', 'longer', 'force', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'phobias', 'still', 'consult', 'most', 'bizarre', 'cases', 'however', 'example', 'how', 'could', '800-lb', 'man', 'commit', 'murder', 'Why', 'was', 'billionaire', 'killed', 'mugging', 'man', 'date', 'fellow', 'airline', 'passenger', 'really', 'kill', 'wife', 'How', 'could', 'man', 'commit', 'murder', 'run', 'marathon', 'same', 'time', 'series', 'classic', 'puzzle', 'mystery', 'genre', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Sometimes', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'how', 'ending', 'know', 'sure', 'More', 'often', 'then', 'not', ""'m"", 'stumped', 'way', 'get', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'various', 'situations', 'find', 'Mr.', 'Monk', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'fears', 'are', 'handled', 'just', 'right', 'provide', 'clues', 'needed', 'humor', 'being', 'top', 'annoying.Of', 'course', 'series', 'helped', 'actors', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'excellent', 'Monk', 'performance', 'just', 'slightly', 'understated', 'deserved', 'Emmy', 'win', 'season', 'Just', 'praise', 'worthy', 'Bitty', 'Schram', 'Monk', 'nurse', 'Sharona', 'mixes', 'exasperated', 'compassionate', 'providing', 'strong', 'sidekick', 'character', ""n't"", 'get', 'lost', 'lead', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'Jason', 'Gray-Stanford', 'police', 'Monk', 'Stanley', 'Kamel', 'Monk', 'shrink', 'are', 'equally', 'excellent.The', 'writing', 'sharp', 'manages', 'find', 'humor', 'mocking', 'Monk', 'subtle', 'clear', 'distinction.This', 'DVD', 'set', 'great', 'old', 'new', 'fans', 'alike', 'twelve', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'are', 'present', 'including', 'previously', 'released', 'two-hour', 'pilot', ""'re"", 'presented', 'widescreen', 'look', 'sharp', 'sound', 'presented', '5.1', 'surround', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'Still', 'job', 'done', 'Disc', 'four', 'short', 'extras', 'discussing', 'creation', 'show', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'disorder', 'cast', 'crew', 'obsessions', 'Emmy', 'win', 'casting', 'Bitty', 'Schram', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'commentary', 'track', 'two', 'outtakes', 'are', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'extras', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'tad', 'better', 'set', 'must', 'have', 'who', 'love', 'light', 'mystery', 'was', 'nice', 'catch', 'cases', ""'d"", 'missed', 'one', 'mystery', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'humor', 'character', 'even', 'remember', 'how']",Monk: Season One

809112,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0001KL5IU,Mitch Weaver,"[12, 15]","Meet Adrian Monk ( Tony Schloub). He is a man who has a countless number of phobias with being afraid of everything from heights and germs to milk. Adrian is also the greatest private detective around with a photographic memory and such a great eye for detail that it is almost creepy. As Adrian says, ""it's a gift and a curse"". Adrian used to be a homocide detective for the San Francisco Police Department, until his wife Trudy was killed in a car bomb. Three years have passed since, and Adrian's fears have made it impossible to be on the force. Adrian is now a private consultant for the department and assists Captain Leland Stottlemeyer ( Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Randall Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford). Also along for the ride is Monk's nurse/personal assitant Sherona Flemming ( Bitty Schram)who keeps Monk in line and helps him with each case.If you were to describe private detective Adrian Monk, it would probably be along the lines of ""Sherlock Holmes being afraid of everything"". This is what makes ""Monk"" one of the best shows that is currently on television. It is hard to classify what type of show Monk really is. Some people including myself watch the show for the cases that Monk solves. Each case is very unpredictable and you actually have a great time trying to solve the case before Monk does. Others watch the show because it tends to be quite funny at times. Tomy Schloub is an amazing actor and is extremely versatile. He made a name for himself playing the character Antonio on the show ""Wings"". He brings the same comic genius to the character Adrian Monk. Bitty Schram is also brilliant as Sherona. Watching her take care of Monk is hilarious. They almost appear to be like the ""Odd Couple"" at times. Ted Levine and Jason Gray-Stratford are excellent as well.Overall, ""Monk"" is one of my all time favorite shows. The actors involved are superb, each case is completely unpredictable, and the laughs are non stop. All I can say, is that it is about time that Monk is coming to DVD. The 13 episode first season is great from start to finish, and it deserves the DVD treatment. There is no word on what the extras will be yet, but the show is worth owning just for the episodes alone.

VERY glad to receive the first season of Monk -- which I didn't catch on USA Network -- as a present.So why only four stars? Perhaps I received a slightly defective DVD, but on my player, some of the dubbing is off. Enough that it is noticeable and annoying. Also, the special features portion did not have sound. There was music, but no voices.Fortunately, I was able to borrow someone else's copy of the DVD to hear the special features. To me, this is one of the greatest things about DVDs -- those special features, and Monk First Season is no exception to this.Overall, this season is great for your collection, whether you've seen the episodes before or never seen Monk in your life. It is so much fun watching Monk work and &quot;play&quot; that you will be lost in his world. And your problems could never be as bad as his!My personal favorite episode is Mr. Monk and the Airplane. In this episode, Monk is forced to fly with Sharona. The entire episode takes place on the airplane where his fears, compulsions, and obsessions take full force, and where he manages to solve a couple mysteries. As a person with a fear of flying myself, this episode had me laughing all the way through.This show only gets better over time. The first season was good. The second season was great! And the third season -- well, you catch my drift. Slowly we learn about Monk's real life -- and Sharona's, too. Will Monk ever solve the mystery closest to him -- what happened to his wife Trudy?

And there is one funny zinger about Nelson's prior IRS problems.The plot is also very predictable.  A man is killed in a dead end alley.  In the alley is a blind witness and someone who is angry with the dead man.  No one else is seen entering or leaving.

It is the only mystery that Monk cant solve and because of that and the loss of his wife, he is forced to leave the force and get help.But the series is far from depressing. Monk actually takes part in some of the most bizarre murders in San Francisco's history [Where the series takes place] whenever the police are stumped. He goes from place to place with his nurse and good friend, Sharona Flemming, as he questions the suspects.In the end of each episode, he manages to prove the guilty murderer why and how he or she, or sometimes both, did the crime. And each time he solves it the ending is still surprising and has lots of twists that all tie in the weird clues that Monk finds in the beginning and middle of each episode.The set includes four DVDs with 3 episodes each:Disk one: Mr. Monk and the Candidate, Mr. Monk meets the psychic, Mr. Monk meets Dale the whale.Disk two: Mr. Monk  goes to the carnival, Mr. Monk goes to the asylum, Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger.Disk three: Mr. Monk and the other woman, Mr. Monk and the Marathon Man, Mr. Monk takes the vacation.Disk four: Mr. Monk and the Earthquake, Mr. Monk meets the Red Headed stranger [Special guest Willie Nelson], and Mr. Monk and the airplane.Each episode is about 45 minutes, besides the opening which is about an hour and a half.

His portrayal of Monk is nothing less that Academy style.  The way he pieces together minute clues makes you take a closer look at the world around you.Losing his wife Trudy sends the man over the edge and his compulsions seem to get the better of him. It is worth continuing the series because the first few seasons are focused on his detective skills.  4 and 5 brink his true personality to life as he begins to cope with his wife's death.The subtle humor of this masterful series makes it a must watch.,5,"Well done, exceptional acting, great storylines.",1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,598,"['Monk', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'savant', 'detective', 'love', 'Tony', 'Shaloub', 'series', 'portrayal', 'Monk', 'nothing', 'Academy', 'style', 'way', 'together', 'minute', 'clues', 'take', 'closer', 'look', 'world', 'you.Losing', 'wife', 'Trudy', 'man', 'edge', 'compulsions', 'seem', 'get', 'better', 'worth', 'continuing', 'series', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'are', 'focused', 'detective', 'skills', '4', '5', 'brink', 'true', 'personality', 'life', 'cope', 'wife', 'death.The', 'subtle', 'humor', 'masterful', 'series', 'must', 'watch']",Monk: Season One
809142,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0001KL5IU,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 2]","I enjoy reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.  There is a part of me that always wanted to have the ability that Holmes' does to come to a crime or mystery and notice what even very keen minds overlook and be able to successfully solve the mystery.  Holmes has been the model of many a television detective Columbo to Jessica Fletcher and served as the current reigning king of cable television, Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub).The first season DVD set of MONK follows Monk as he returns to public life seven years after the murder of his beloved wife, Trudy.  The two-part series opener sets the stage for the rest of the series.  Monk was a brilliant homicide detective in the San Francisco police department before his wife's death. In fact, he solved every case he was assigned to.  Monk was always an unusual character, but after Trudy's death, all of his disorders and phobias became accentuated.  Through the assistance of a nurse, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram), Monk was able to return to public life and the first episode features his first case as a private consultant hired by his former commander, Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine).There are two things that really set MONK apart from other shows that came before it.  One is the writing.  Unlike most previous television detectives, e.g. Columbo, Monk is who he is.  He doesn't pretend to be less intelligent than he is and his obsessions and phobias are all real. The unusual places and situations that Monk finds himself in are often humorous because of this.  In the hands of lesser writers, these situations could be used solely for comic effect to mock Monk, but they never are.  Comical and funny things happen, but Monk and most of the rest of the cast are never mocked (the only exception to this being Randy Disher-portrayed by Jason Gray-Stanford-who sometimes eats crow because of his Barney Fife-type personality).The other thing that really stands out about MONK is the superb acting, especially Tony Shalhoub.  Monk could easily have just been played as a caricature and the show would have still been a good show.  However, Shalhoub never played Monk that way and his performance truly brings Monk to life.  As quirky, odd, and unusual Monk is, he seems like a real person and reminds viewers and fans of people in their own lives.  Shalhoub has so far won three Emmy's for his portrayal of Adrain Monk and has been nominated several times more. It's not difficult to understand why.The first season includes the following episodes:Episode 1--""Mr. Monk and the Candidate, Part I""--Monk returns to public life after being called on to investigate the attempted assassination of a mayoral candidate and the murder of his bodyguard.Episode 2--""Mr. Monk and the Candidate, Part II""--Monk solves the case.  Involves an exciting chase through the sewers and features one of the few times in the entire series where Monk shoots a weapon.Episode 3--""Mr. Monk and the Psychic""--Dolly, a false psychic with a record wakes up one morning in her car next to a murder scene. She claims that the dead woman lead her there to find her, but Monk suspects there more to the story that Dolly doesn't know.Episode 4--""Mr. Monk Meets Dale the Whale""--Dale Biederbeck is to Monk as Moriarty is to Sherlock Holmes.  Dale is a Whale of a man, weighing over 800 lbs. who is unable to leave his bed.  But, Dale the Whale is also a very wealthy and extremely intelligent person who has been suspected of being the mastermind of many past crimes.  The murdered judge called 911 and clearly states that Dale the Whale is trying to kill her and a ten-year boy eyewitnesses a huge, fat man roaming around the house.  But how could Dale the Whale have killed the judge if he can't even get out of bed?  Monk figures out how.Episode 5--""Mr. Monk Goes to the Carnival""--Monk hates carnivals and circuses, but when a friend of Stottlemeyer is framed for a crime at a carnival, Monk takes the case and in doing so tries to prove to the Captain that he's ready to be reinstated to the police force.Episode 6--""Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum""--when Monk comes home to an apartment that's not his, Sharona and the Captain convince him to check into an asylum.  While there, Monk becomes convinced that chief psychiatrist committed a murder committed a murder on the grounds years ago.Episode 7--""Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger""--a local software billionaire is shot by an ex-police officer in what appears to be a random mugging during which a police officer flees the scene of the crime.  Nothing in the case makes any sense.  Meanwhile, after her paycheck bounces, Sharona quicks working for Adrian.Episode 8--""Mr. Monk and the Other Woman""--a series of murders leads Stottlemeyer to believe that a blonde woman who looks a little like Monk's wife Trudy is the culprit.  However, he only has circumstantial evidence and a hunch and to make matters worse, Monk finds himself falling for the woman.Episode 9--""Mr. Monk and the Marathon Man""--a woman is murdered during the San Francisco marathon and the prime suspect is her lover.  The problem is that the man was running in the marathon during the time of the murder.Episode 10--""Mr. Monk Takes a Vacation""--Monk takes a vacation with Sharona and her ten-year-old son, Benjy.  Benjy is convinced he sees a man murdered through a window, but there's no body or evidence.  Sharona thinks that Benjy's imagination is running on overtime and that he has grown attached to Monk, but Adrian believes Benjy and tries to help him solve the crime.Episode 11--""Mr. Monk and the Earthquake""--a major earthquake in San Francisco leaves Monk shaken, but believes that a murderer has used the disaster as a cover-up for his crime.  Also, Monk meets Sharona's sister.Episode 12--""Mr. Monk and the Red-Headed Stranger""--after a verbal confrontation with his manager, Willie Nelson becomes the prime suspect in the man's murder, but the only witness to the crime is a blind woman.Episode 13--""Mr. Monk and the Airplane""--tricked by Sharona into taking a trip to visit her aunt in New Jersey, Monk becomes convinced that a fellow passenger murdered his wife and the woman sitting next to him is an imposter.  Monk has to solve the case and the body has to be found before the plane leaves and the suspected couple leaves for Europe.The DVD includes five behind the scenes featurettes and that's it. They are all very short and not very entertaining or informative.  The only two I found any interest in were ""Mr. Monk and His Origins"" because it gives some information about the creation of the character and ""Mr. Monk and His Partners in Crime"" because it has actors from the show (not Tony Shalhoub) talking about their characters.",5,Introducing Adrian Monk,1235260800,"02 22, 2009",2009,6725,"['enjoy', 'reading', 'Sir', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle',
