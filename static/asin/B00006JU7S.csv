718992,ANGH6401L9Y0T,B00006JU7S,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[2, 2]","Audrey Hepburn is incandescent in this movie. She seems like a silly, if charming, child at the beginning, and a wise but still charming woman grown at the end. In between is 208 minutes (nearly 3 1/2 hours) of grand scope. Lavish sets and locations, marvelous costumes, magnificent actors, and of course a towering story. Henry Fonda and Mel Ferrer are both worthy of the love lavished on them.Yes, with 3 1/2 hours of Russian intensity, it can get tedious at times. But the basic story is of the Emperor Napoleon's ill-fated invasion of Russia. The Russians fall back and fall back, leaving nothing but burned countryside behind them, all the way to Moscow. Napoleon is furious when there is no one left in Moscow to surrender to him. His ego is bruised beyond repair. Eventually he realizes that winter is coming and he'd better get back to France. But of course, it's a very, very long march, and the snows catch him. The Russian Army did very little; Mother Russia and her snow did it all.The story is as much about complex romantic situations as about the war. Like Scarlett O'Hara (but with much more class), Natasha returns to her ruined home, determined to rebuild her home and her family and her life. In fact, this movie has a great deal in common with Gone With the Wind, a fact which may have occurred to others before me. I'm a bit slow at times.Four stars.

718993,A1XNXHTPQRACRO,B00006JU7S,Barry C. Chow,"[21, 22]","This is a tough one. In this film adaptation of one of the greatest of the literary classics, one is left wondering whether the magic that one feels comes from the film or is carried over from the novel. For those of us who have read the novel, the artistic license that King Vidal takes is difficult to swallow. Even if we understand that something must inevitably be sacrificed in the distillation of such a massive tome, the abridgement of so much literary genius is troubling. Whole characters, episodes and entire subplots are missing, to say nothing of the larger drama of an ancient and honourable culture teetering on the brink of ruin. As hard as the film tries, it misses this sense of awful grandeur and fails to invoke the overwhelming sweep of history conveyed so well in the novel.Where it succeeds is in the smaller stories: the lives of the key protagonists, their loves, passions, accomplishments and deaths. We see some admirable performances, especially by Audrey Hepburn as Natasha. She is stunning as a precocious innocent who journeys into womanhood through the brutality of war. Henry Fonda at first seems miscast as a gangly nebbish Peter, until you see him decisively defending Natasha's honour and then confessing his love to her, or clinging to life and hope as a grimly determined prisoner of war. And Mel Ferrer invests his Andrew with what I think is just the right mixture of aloofness, sensitivity, passion and angst. When he first asks Natasha to dance, standing there in his uniform of white and serge, you can understand how Audrey Hepburn fell in love with him in real life. Their scenes together show the tension and tenderness of a real couple, and bring a believable romantic chemistry to the screen. Then there is the splendid cast of supporting actors from Natasha's endearing parents to Andrew's martinet of a father to Herbert Lom's surprisingly complex and sympathetic Napoleon. They don't make character actors like these anymore.It goes without saying that the plot is magnificent. But this is once again more of a tribute to the novel than the film. Only an idiot could have hashed such a wonderful story.However, this film is no more about plot than it is about politics. I always felt that Tolstoy's choice of title does his novel an injustice, giving it the air of a political treatise that belies its humanity. War and Peace is only peripherally about either war or peace. While his book does polemicize about war, politics and history, it really only finds its stride when focusing on its ageless themes of hope, love, loss and redemption. And because his characters are constructed so skilfully, we care for them and feel their emotions as if they were our own. To this extent, the film largely succeeds. It is true enough to the heart of the characters that it effectively conveys the novel's essence, even if it doesn't adhere strictly to the novel itself.It's not perfect. For one thing, it contains irritating affectations that are simply unnecessary. For example, Napoleon is shown directing his army in the midst of the battlefield while reclining and with his legs propped up on a footstool. In fact, Napoleon never showed such contempt for his soldiers and often placed himself dangerously near the front lines astride a white charger as an example of courage and trust in his men. And this movie, like Gone with the Wind, to which it is often compared, commits the sin of glossing over the treatment of its underclass. The front line Russian soldier was a starved, ill-equipped peasant pressed into service and kept from deserting with whippings and the threat of death. The movie focuses on the lives and loves of the nobility to the exclusion of practically all else, and this is one area where the film could have gained by departing from the novel.This is more than a ""period"" film and even those who are allergic to such fare might wish to give it a chance. In all, it is a fine film to be admired more for its characterizations than its accuracy. It comes off especially well when compared to its contemporary ""epics"" like Cleopatra, or Ben Hur, because the characters were created not by Hollywood screenwriters, but by a literary genius, and are thus imbued with an almost Shakespearean presence. However, it will not appeal to people with unbending views about either their literature or their history. Tolstoy's novel subsumed his characters to the larger story of a Russia under siege. This is why he populated the world of his novel with so many people. In this film, Hollywood justifies the presence of its big stars by ignoring the larger canvass to concentrate on the lives of a select few. The result is a film much reduced in scope from the spirit of the novel, but still effective in its diminished way.",4,A Flawed Though Underrated Gem,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,4783,"['tough', 'one', 'film', 'adaptation', 'one', 'greatest', 'literary', 'classics', 'one', 'left', 'wondering', 'magic', 'one', 'film', 'carried', 'novel', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'novel', 'artistic', 'license', 'King', 'Vidal', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'Even', 'understand', 'something', 'must', 'inevitably', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'distillation', 'such', 'massive', 'tome', 'abridgement', 'so', 'much', 'literary', 'genius', 'troubling', 'Whole', 'characters', 'episodes', 'entire', 'subplots', 'are', 'missing', 'say', 'nothing', 'larger', 'drama', 'ancient', 'honourable', 'culture', 'teetering', 'brink', 'ruin', 'As', 'hard', 'film', 'tries', 'sense', 'awful', 'grandeur', 'invoke', 'overwhelming', 'sweep', 'history', 'conveyed', 'so', 'well', 'novel.Where', 'smaller', 'stories', 'lives', 'key', 'protagonists', 'loves', 'passions', 'accomplishments', 'deaths', 'see', 'admirable', 'performances', 'especially', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Natasha', 'stunning', 'precocious', 'innocent', 'who', 'womanhood', 'brutality', 'war', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'first', 'miscast', 'gangly', 'nebbish', 'Peter', 'see', 'decisively', 'defending', 'Natasha', 'honour', 'then', 'confessing', 'love', 'clinging', 'life', 'hope', 'grimly', 'determined', 'prisoner', 'war', 'Mel', 'Ferrer', 'Andrew', 'what', 'think', 'just', 'right', 'mixture', 'aloofness', 'sensitivity', 'passion', 'angst', 'When', 'first', 'Natasha', 'dance', 'standing', 'there', 'uniform', 'white', 'serge', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'fell', 'love', 'real', 'life', 'scenes', 'together', 'show', 'tension', 'tenderness', 'real', 'couple', 'bring', 'believable', 'romantic', 'chemistry', 'screen', 'Then', 'splendid', 'cast', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Natasha', 'endearing', 'parents', 'Andrew', 'martinet', 'father', 'Herbert', 'Lom', 'surprisingly', 'complex', 'sympathetic', 'Napoleon', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'character', 'actors', 'anymore.It', 'saying', 'plot', 'magnificent', 'once', 'again', 'more', 'tribute', 'novel', 'film', 'Only', 'idiot', 'could', 'have', 'hashed', 'wonderful', 'story.However', 'film', 'more', 'plot', 'politics', 'always', 'felt', 'Tolstoy', 'choice', 'title', 'novel', 'injustice', 'giving', 'air', 'political', 'treatise', 'humanity', 'War', 'Peace', 'only', 'peripherally', 'war', 'peace', 'book', 'polemicize', 'war', 'politics', 'history', 'really', 'only', 'stride', 'when', 'focusing', 'ageless', 'themes', 'hope', 'love', 'loss', 'redemption', 'characters', 'are', 'constructed', 'so', 'skilfully', 'care', 'feel', 'emotions', 'were', 'own', 'extent', 'film', 'largely', 'true', 'enough', 'heart', 'characters', 'effectively', 'conveys', 'novel', 'essence', 'even', ""n't"", 'adhere', 'strictly', 'novel', 'itself.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'one', 'thing', 'irritating', 'affectations', 'are', 'simply', 'unnecessary', 'example', 'Napoleon', 'shown', 'directing', 'army', 'midst', 'battlefield', 'reclining', 'legs', 'propped', 'up', 'footstool', 'fact', 'Napoleon', 'never', 'showed', 'such', 'contempt', 'soldiers', 'often', 'placed', 'dangerously', 'front', 'lines', 'white', 'charger', 'example', 'courage', 'trust', 'men', 'movie', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'often', 'compared', 'sin', 'glossing', 'treatment', 'underclass', 'front', 'line', 'Russian', 'soldier', 'was', 'starved', 'ill-equipped', 'peasant', 'pressed', 'service', 'kept', 'deserting', 'whippings', 'threat', 'death', 'movie', 'lives', 'loves', 'nobility', 'exclusion', 'practically', 'else', 'one', 'area', 'where', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'gained', 'departing', 'novel.This', 'more', 'period', 'film', 'even', 'who', 'are', 'allergic', 'such', 'fare', 'might', 'wish', 'give', 'chance', 'fine', 'film', 'be', 'admired', 'more', 'characterizations', 'accuracy', 'off', 'especially', 'well', 'when', 'compared', 'contemporary', 'epics', 'Cleopatra', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'characters', 'were', 'created', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'screenwriters', 'literary', 'genius', 'are', 'thus', 'imbued', 'almost', 'Shakespearean', 'presence', 'However', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'people', 'unbending', 'views', 'literature', 'history', 'Tolstoy', 'novel', 'subsumed', 'characters', 'larger', 'story', 'Russia', 'siege', 'why', 'populated', 'world', 'novel', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'film', 'Hollywood', 'presence', 'big', 'stars', 'ignoring', 'larger', 'canvass', 'concentrate', 'lives', 'select', 'few', 'result', 'film', 'much', 'reduced', 'scope', 'spirit', 'novel', 'still', 'effective', 'diminished', 'way']",N/A
718994,A1KC9VBLF4J93G,B00006JU7S,Benoit Racine,"[8, 8]","This film came out on DVD this month and I rushed to buy it. This version is the first to render all the detail and perfection of Jack Cardiff's a-ma-zing compositions and brilliant, varied photography. As a collection of definitive, memorable images, this film is better than any comparable historical epic of the period and even gives GWTW a run for its money. King Vidor's direction is a series of `tableaux vivants' where the characters are not posing but acting in a very natural, period-specific way. I have never had a problem with this adaptation of Tolstoy's novel. I think it is a wonderful introduction to the period and the novel and that it is a very poetic, very original work in its own right. The most conspicuous handicap of this movie, in my opinion, besides a few rough patches in the generally pristine celluloid - Natasha unevenly shifts from light to dark while waiting for a dancing partner at the ball and she has a hole in her nose at the opera - is its soundtrack (in glorious mono). The barely hi-fi recording of dialogues and music sounds pinched, hollow and tinny and it always has in every version I have ever seen: in the theatres, on TV and on video. Even the soundtrack album is an abomination. As limited as it is, this soundtrack is at least free of static and scratches. In some scenes, however, before the necessary adjustments (With a Dolby 5.1 receiver, try the ""Mono Movie"" CD setting and amplifying the ""surround effects"" and subwoofer volume to a maximum), Audrey Hepburn's and Mel Ferrer's voices actually hurt your ear. Nino Rota's very Russian-sounding score is serviceable and melodic, although rather sparse in its orchestration and in the number of players. But maybe that's his hommage to Mozart's simplicity... One can only wonder what `War and Peace' could have sounded like with a cohort of Hollywood arrangers, decent recording facilities and lavish, varied orchestrations in true high fidelity and stereophonic sound. According to Lukas Kendall of `Film Score Monthly', the original recording elements of the soundtrack have long ago disappeared, which is the common lot of international, independent co-productions of the era. Someone somewhere is certainly guilty of skimping on quality or embezzlement for this 1956 movie to sound so much worse than a 1939, pre-hi-fi epic like GWTW.

718995,A2XFA2HIIKS5G2,B00006JU7S,Bentley,"[4, 4]","I guess I am a purist when it comes to the classics. I like the movie script to follow the original work which I am sorry to say this movie does not. From the first scene in the movie, it is almost like they took extracts from all of the book's events and rearranged the entire timeline. Some of the scenes never happened, others did not happen as they were portrayed, there are many lines in the movie which never were uttered by any of Tolstoy's characters and to me the choices of actors for some of the roles were very misguided. Who in their right mind would choose Henry Fonda as Pierre (he sounds like he is from Kansas). Pierre was described all through Tolstoy's epic as being fat, slovenly, very large, etc., wide of girth. Though Henry Fonda was a very fine actor, they seemed to have missed their mark. There were many such misses.Of course, the scenery and the action shots are also very dated. But if the script had followed Tolstoy's work, I would have been happy; but it did not.The only saving grace was of course Audrey Hepburn who to me was a perfect Natasha. I wish that they had had a younger actress playing the younger Natasha who plays with dolls but they only used Miss Hepburn for the entire sequence of events.Ms. Hepburn was wonderful in this role, beautiful and so full of life. I think that she and Mel Ferrer were the two (2) jewels of this film and at the time I believe they were actually married.I think as a true depiction and adaptation of Tolstoy's masterpiece this movie production failed. But as an entertaining and whimsical portrayal of extracts of this fine book and as pure entertainment with some very fine actors even if it was sadly a broad detour from the book itself, I would give it three stars for the efforts of Ferrer and Hepburn alone.Be forewarned if you are counting on an accurate depiction of the book. It is just the Hollywood version with all of its literary liberties fully exploited.

Cremin,"[4, 4]","It's odd that this movie runs three hours and twenty eight minutes and it's considered the short, condensed version of Tolstoy's literary masterpiece.  The novel is actually much better known and deserves to be.  As much I acknowledge King Vidor as the one of the pioneer directors and a maverick who went his own way throughout his career, this movie is a bit of a disappointment.  After all, this is the same director who directed ""The Big Parade"", the anti war movie that launched MGM.King Vidor was not your typical Texan.  Movies he made just before this was ""Duel in the Sun"" for Selznick and ""The Fountainhead"" written by Ann Rand.  This ""War and Peace"" was made in Italy and was produced by Dino deLaurentis.  Vidor and six other writers had the tast of condensing Tolstoy's classic, eliminating major subplots and streamling the storylines of the three protangonists.The main protangonist in the book is Pierre Bezahov, here played by Henry Fonda.  In 1968, Sergie Bondachuk played Pierre and wrote and directed a nine hour and much better movie than this one.  Sergie even looked more like the book Pierre.  Fonda could have played him more accurately, after all, he made ""The Wrong Man"" around the time and he was no longer a spring chicken.  But here, he's dashing even when he wins a duel literally by accident. However, he does his best work when forced to walk as a prisoner to the French.  He shows dignity in such adject conditions.Audrey Hepburn should have been perfect as Natasha and at times, is.  However, it's not very convincing that she's just a naive little girl in the beginning and a woman who's been though a lot at the end.  Not that's not her fault.  Vidor with makeup artists, etc. should have created that illusion.  In fact, the story is supposed to take seven years and this movie doesn't convince us of that at all.Mel Ferrer was Audrey's leading man offscream but he's missing the meloncholy about Andrei is supposed to project.  He does have passible good looks and be standoffish but not really much else.However, he and Andrey do look well together and she also has excellent rapport with Fonda.  Herbet Lom plays an interesting Napolean.  Anita Ekberg looks beautiful and is not asked to do much else.The battle scenes are very well done and there is good levity when Fonda appears as a spectator.  Ferrer's death scene is way too long and a bit unforgivable as some interesting bits of Tolstoy could have gone in.Tolstoy's musing about life are basically unfilmable but something could have gone in.  Instead, the movie ends with Henry and Natasha reunited. However, the main parts of the basic story were covered.I just wish it had more the transcendance that the ending of ""The Crowd"" did.

719005,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00006JU7S,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[12, 12]","This audacious endeavor to bring Leo Tolstoy's brilliant epic novel ""War and Peace"" to the silver screen deserves kudos. Director King Vidor manages, superbly, to coherently condense the novel's almost 1500 pages into 208 minutes of viewing time. Here he successfully captures the flavor of Russia at war and at peace from 1805, around the time of the Battle of Austerlitz, where Napoleon and his army of the First French Empire engaged the armies of the Russian and Austrian Empires to Napoleon's invasion of Mother Russia, and Moscow itself, in 1812.The focus is on the social, political, and military upheavals of this period in Russia...with some philosophy thrown in. Co-producers Paramount Pictures, Carlo Ponti, and Dino de Laurentiis apparently spent over six million dollars to make this cinematic extravaganza. The phenomenal battle scenes, directed by Mario Soldati, reflect the cost and the effort as, at times, they appear to be taken from newsreels - in living Technicolor. They are detailed and, frequently, heartrending in nature.One of the major differences between the book and the movie is that while Tolstoy was able to write, in depth, about the lives of five Russian families - both noble and peasant, fleshing out each character brilliantly, director Vidor has had to concentrate, out of necessity, on just a few representative characters from the aristocratic Rostov and Bolkonsky families and Pierre Bezuhov. Pierre begins life as the natural son of a prince and goes on to become legitimized and made, unexpectedly, the extremely wealthy heir to a title and large fortune when his father dies. The serfs and their historic plight are way underrepresented here, however.Henry Fonda does a good job in his role as Pierre Bezuhov, probably the central character of both book and film - although he comes across as much more of a Yankee than a Russian or European. Beginning as a somewhat befuddled, carefree outsider - an observer of others with a philosophical nature, he becomes burdened with his newfound responsibilities as a nobleman. He aspires to free his peasants from their lives of drudgery and to improve his many estates, but accomplishes little as he becomes mired down in a marriage with a sophisticated, shallow, immoral women whom he comes to despise. He is an intimate friend of the Rostov family.Audrey Hepburn is at her best here as Natasha Rostov, an exuberant adolescent who grows into a beautiful, vivacious woman. Hepburn demonstrates her ability to capture a wide range of moods and emotions as Natasha matures and experiences love, joy, profound sorrow and loss.Mel Ferrer is the proud, somewhat cynical, tragic Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. Descended from a military family, his only sense of romance is related to war and heroism. This romanticism does not last as he becomes exposed to the true horrors of the battlefield. While Ferrer is not my idea of a talented actor, he does carry this part off well. Prince Andrei is not called upon to portray a variety of emotions.Although Vidor's ""War and Peace"" is far from perfect, I think he does an admirable job of capturing Tolstoy's major themes of family relationships, social and political change as a result of war and as the younger generation comes of age. While much of Tolstoy's spiritual and philosophical thoughts and theories are absent here, ""War and Peace"" works well as a romantic epic... of Russia before, during and after tremendous upheaval.This is a colorful and entertaining movie with no pretensions of being profound. And then there's Audrey Hepburn...reason enough to rent the epic production.JANA",4,A Highly Entertaining Hollywood Interpretation of Tolstoy's Epic Novel.,1154995200,"08 8, 2006",2006,3613,"['audacious', 'endeavor', 'bring', 'Leo', 'Tolstoy', 'brilliant', 'epic', 'novel', 'War', 'Peace', 'silver', 'screen', 'kudos', 'Director', 'King', 'Vidor', 'superbly', 'coherently', 'condense', 'novel', 'almost', '1500', 'pages', '208', 'minutes', 'viewing', 'time', 'Here', 'successfully', 'flavor', 'Russia', 'war', 'peace', '1805', 'time', 'Battle', 'Austerlitz', 'where', 'Napoleon', 'army', 'First', 'French', 'Empire', 'engaged', 'armies', 'Russian', 'Austrian', 'Empires', 'Napoleon', 'invasion', 'Mother', 'Russia', 'Moscow', '1812.The', 'focus', 'social', 'political', 'military', 'upheavals', 'period', 'Russia', 'philosophy', 'thrown', 'Co-producers', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'Carlo', 'Ponti', 'Dino', 'de', 'Laurentiis', 'apparently', 'spent', 'six', 'million', 'dollars', 'make', 'cinematic', 'extravaganza', 'phenomenal', 'battle', 'scenes', 'directed', 'Mario', 'Soldati', 'reflect', 'cost', 'effort', 'times', 'appear', 'be', 'taken', 'newsreels', 'living', 'Technicolor', 'are', 'detailed', 'frequently', 'heartrending', 'nature.One', 'major', 'differences', 'book', 'movie', 'Tolstoy', 'was', 'able', 'write', 'depth', 'lives', 'five', 'Russian', 'families', 'noble', 'peasant', 'fleshing', 'out', 'character', 'brilliantly', 'director', 'Vidor', 'had', 'concentrate', 'necessity', 'just', 'few', 'representative', 'characters', 'aristocratic', 'Rostov', 'Bolkonsky', 'families', 'Pierre', 'Bezuhov', 'Pierre', 'life', 'natural', 'son', 'prince', 'become', 'legitimized', 'made', 'unexpectedly', 'extremely', 'wealthy', 'heir', 'title', 'large', 'fortune', 'when', 'father', 'dies', 'serfs', 'historic', 'plight', 'are', 'way', 'underrepresented', 'here', 'however.Henry', 'Fonda', 'good', 'job', 'role', 'Pierre', 'Bezuhov', 'probably', 'central', 'character', 'book', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'Yankee', 'Russian', 'European', 'Beginning', 'somewhat', 'befuddled', 'carefree', 'outsider', 'observer', 'others', 'philosophical', 'nature', 'burdened', 'newfound', 'responsibilities', 'nobleman', 'free', 'peasants', 'lives', 'drudgery', 'improve', 'many', 'estates', 'little', 'mired', 'down', 'marriage', 'sophisticated', 'shallow', 'immoral', 'women', 'whom', 'despise', 'intimate', 'friend', 'Rostov', 'family.Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'best', 'here', 'Natasha', 'Rostov', 'exuberant', 'adolescent', 'who', 'beautiful', 'vivacious', 'woman', 'Hepburn', 'ability', 'capture', 'wide', 'range', 'moods', 'emotions', 'Natasha', 'matures', 'experiences', 'love', 'joy', 'profound', 'sorrow', 'loss.Mel', 'Ferrer', 'proud', 'somewhat', 'cynical', 'tragic', 'Prince', 'Andrei', 'Bolkonsky', 'Descended', 'military', 'family', 'only', 'sense', 'romance', 'related', 'war', 'heroism', 'romanticism', 'not', 'last', 'exposed', 'true', 'horrors', 'battlefield', 'Ferrer', 'not', 'idea', 'talented', 'actor', 'carry', 'part', 'off', 'well', 'Prince', 'Andrei', 'not', 'called', 'upon', 'portray', 'variety', 'emotions.Although', 'Vidor', 'War', 'Peace', 'far', 'perfect', 'think', 'admirable', 'job', 'capturing', 'Tolstoy', 'major', 'themes', 'family', 'relationships', 'social', 'political', 'change', 'result', 'war', 'younger', 'generation', 'age', 'much', 'Tolstoy', 'spiritual', 'philosophical', 'thoughts', 'theories', 'are', 'absent', 'here', 'War', 'Peace', 'well', 'romantic', 'epic', 'Russia', 'tremendous', 'upheaval.This', 'colorful', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'pretensions', 'being', 'profound', 'then', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'reason', 'enough', 'rent', 'epic', 'production.JANA']",N/A

Some, including some in Russia, see him as the wave of things to come.

719012,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00006JU7S,Linda Linguvic,"[4, 5]","I recently read this epic novel by Leo Tolstoy, all 1350 pages of it.  I loved it and consider it one of the greatest books of all time.  Therefore, I must say I was skeptical about any movie based on the book but I was willing to give this 1956 version a chance.  Frankly, I was delightfully surprised.  This 3-1/2 hour film captured the essence of the book.  The sets and costumes were great, the battle sequences expertly captured, and the actors all did a fantastic job of giving depth to the characters.Set in the early 19th Century in Russia, Audrey Hepburn is cast as Natasha, an impetuous aristocratic young woman.  She plays her role like a breath of fresh air and is so pretty that it was hard to take my eyes off her.  There is a great ballroom scene where she meets and falls in love with Prince Andrei, played by Mel Ferrer, who is a titled widower who wants to marry her immediately. However, his father insists the couple wait a year because she is so young.  During that time a flirtation with another man leads to a dissolution of the relationship.  Another important character is Pierre, played by Henry Fonda, an illegitimate son of a wealthy aristocrat who unexpectedly inherits a fortune and makes a bad marriage to a avaricious and unfaithful wife.In the meantime, war is coming to Russia in the shape of Napoleon's army.  Prince Andrei goes to war. And Pierre, even though he is not a soldier, experiences the battlefield.  Eventually Napoleon enters Moscow.  Everyone flees, include Natasha and her family and these scenes capture the essence of the horror of war and its effect both on the soldiers and on the populace.Of course, not all the details of the literary masterwork can be captured in a film.

719014,A1D90MKRWB0ZKP,B00006JU7S,March boy,"[2, 2]","Academy award nominations: Director-King Vidor, Costume Design and Cinematography.March boy nominations: Cinematography, Costume Design, Set Design and Original Score.Wins: Leading Actress-Audrey Hepburn and Supporting Actor-Herbert Lom.King Vidor&#8217;s War and Peace is just one of those nutty &#8216;campy&#8217; movies that grab me. I would by no means call it a terrific or groundbreaking piece of cinema but I think it is well worth watching nonetheless.Some of the acting is as professional cineastes have said, less than perfect. Henry Fonda (Pierre) seems more American country farmer than European aristocrat, Mel Ferrer (Prince Andre) has a tendency to stare off in space and say his lines in a harsh, flat monotone (he does get better towards the end, though, especially when he&#8217;s with Audrey Hepburn) Jeremy Brett (Nicholas) says some of his lines a little too fast and Anita Ekberg&#8217;s blond bimbo wife Helene is syrupy and supremely annoying (although it is somewhat appropriate given the extreme unlikableness of the character) but what makes this movie special is the intelligence and overall scope of the script&#8212;how it summarizes one of the longest novels I&#8217;ve ever read and does full justice to the plot. There are several scenes right out of the book; Natasha on the balcony, declaring her love for Andre, Pierre&#8217;s duel with Fyodor Dolokov, (He even says &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to use this gun. Show me. I just forgot&#8221;) Natasha begging Andre and Pierre&#8217;s forgiveness, the deathbed vigil in the monastery, etc.)Purists of classic literature (like Jane Eyre, Sense and Sensibility, etc.) who complain about movies not putting in every little detail of the book are not using their heads. Literature and film are two very different mediums of art. The purpose of a book is to add detail and richness (every incidental, unnecessary subplot and peripheral character) to the story; the purpose of a movie is to summarize, to keep everything brief, concise and to the point. If you try to cram ever little detail you usually end up with a very boring movie.There are some good strong supporting performances mostly from Oscar Homolka as the elderly general Kutuzov and Helmut Dantine and Vittorio Gassman as the libertine soldiers, Fyodor and Anatole. Gassman is extremely handsome and simply oozes roguish charm and masculinity; I could feel the hairs of the back of my neck stand up when he&#8217;s stalking Audrey Hepburn at the party. John Mills is warm and endearing as the Christian prisoner Pierre makes friends with near the end of the film.Best of all though, is Herbert Lom&#8217;s energetic characterization of Napoleon Bonaparte who delivers his lines with just the right amount of wit, spark and dramatic flourish. He has the scariest eyes, especially towards the end when he says the title of my review.I wish Audrey Hepburn had won an Academy award for Natasha Rostov in War and Peace instead of Princess Ann in Roman Holiday. Her performance in this movie was actually an improvement on her ing&eacute;nue roles in her previous romantic comedies because she got to play a more complex character. She does so much with the soft, soothing sound of her voice and her subtle facial expressions. What I love best about her performance is that she doesn&#8217;t sanctify her character. She can be silly, annoying and say a lot of nonsense but what makes her special is how she endears herself to her family and three suitors; how she slowly grows in a wiser and more sensible woman; the number of lessons she learns throughout the film such as maturity, constancy, responsibility and being wise in matters of the heart.And her character transformation doesn&#8217;t just happen all of a sudden like a light turned on and off. Yes, Pierre saving her from Anatole is a major wake-up call for her but there are still several shades of gray throughout the first half of the film (as opposed to just black and white) that foreshadow the fully accomplished woman that is to come, like:1. When she tells Pierre at the beginning she would vote for him for Prime Minister because his heart is pure.2. When she goes down the stairs right before Andre&#8217;s proposal. Her off-screen voice says &#8220;Is it possible that I Natasha am to become the wife of this strange, dear clever man whom even my father looks up to? Can it be true that now I am grown up (and here come the kicker line) and on me lies the RESPONSIBILTY OF MY EVERY WORD AND DEED?&#8221;3. Anatole dancing with her alone after she has entered the engagement with Andre. He declares his love for her. She gets an uneasy look on her face and runs out of the room begging her father to take her home. Even though she&#8217;s still the silly, nave, namby pamby twit, at this point, she senses something is not right&#8212;she has given this man too much attention.Hepburn has so many terrific moments like the tense, disturbing interactions with Anatole, the final scene where her face radiates with joy now that Pierre has come back and that scene where she&#8217;s crying uncontrollably and begging Pierre&#8217;s forgiveness for trying to elope with Anatole just slays me every time. I have no problem with Ingrid Bergman winning Best Leading Actress for her broad, grand, showy turn in Anastasia but it&#8217;s a crying shame Audrey Hepburn didn&#8217;t even get nominated.Nino Rota&#8217;s music contains rich, beautiful, pseudo classical melodies. Jack Cardiff&#8217;s shot composition is superb&#8212;rich shades of earth and flesh tones, gray, tan, brown and green. My favorite shot is when Prince Andre dies. The monastery is very simple and stoic&#8212;greyish white walls, a dark brown floor and arches in the back with radiant shafts of reddish orange light. I&#8217;ve never really cared for Mel Ferrer&#8217;s cold, detached style but in that one scene he really gives a great performance. The gentle, wistful, airy way he gives his final speech always gets to me. &#8220;I had a wonderful dream. I dreamt that I died. I saw an open door with light shining from it. Then I awoke. Yes, death is an awakening. You see? It&#8217;s all so simple.&#8221;What I like about King Vidor&#8217;s direction is how he doesn&#8217;t opt for slicked up costumes and sets. He&#8217;s not afraid to make the Rostov&#8217;s mansion simple and elegant and the interiors of the Moscow invasion scenes dirty, gritty and realistic.I recommend this movie. It definitely has its flaws (hence my three star rating) but there is still much to admire and enjoy.",3,"&#8220;I warn you gentlemen, I cannot sit here and watch my army decay.&#8221;",1399334400,"05

Later this lack of emotion or evolvement shines forth as he goes though many hardships as a prisoner of Napoleon. Mel Ferrer as Prince Andrei, then Audrey Hepburn's real husband, has the same problem as Henry Fonda, he drifts in & out of character. I believe the problem with the main male actors is that they played it too straight. The woman who played Prince Andrei's 1st wife did the worst, she over acted like a silent movie star. The supporting cast does a great job, specially the actor playing Nepoleon. This is exactly what I think Nepoleon looked & acted like in the early 19th century.

Mel Ferrer?But it was free and so I watched it one summer night when I didn't have anything else to do.  Low expectations make for happy surprises.  Henry Fonda has the most American, nasal, reedy, accent but after a while I could get past that as he did a good job of playing the sincere, good Pierre who goes from being a philosopher who stands back from the action of life to one who enters the realm of love and war and learns a lot.  Fonda is always good at playing ""sincere"" in any culture.Audrey Hepburn shines as Natasha, whose luminous charm lights up the screen as her presence lightens the lives of those around her.  One of the best scenes in the film is the ball where Natasha dances almost magically, while her Prince Charming, Andrei, watches transfixed.  It's her first ball, her first love and she is full of beauty and the love of love.  Hepburn, trained as a classical ballerina, is just perfect here.I admit I got a bit tired of her by the end, though.  Her particular brand of quixotic charm palled a bit after three hours.Mel Ferrer, Hepburns' real life husband at the time, is ok for the part.  We don't see a lot of him, which is probably just as well, as his acting ability seems rather limited to looking handsome.I loved the small bit of John Mills as the philosophical peasant.  He seemed to embody Tolstoy's philosophy of life and I wish we'd seen more of him.  His was, frankly, the only death I really mourned.When you think that this was made in Hollywood in the 50's, it's not so bad.

Since then, of course, there have been dozens of other epic films whose special effects were aided and enhanced by technologies then unavailable to Vidor and his crew. However, given the scope and depth of Tolstoy's examination of Russia in the 1805-1815 time period, even a film produced today could not possibly do full justice to his novel. My rating takes into full (and respectful) account when this film was made; also, I admit being charmed by Audrey Hepburn's style and grace in the role of Natasha. However, Vidor's direction seems to me uninspired, at times listless, and Henry Fonda (one of my favorite actors) is woefully miscast as Pierre. However, there are several magnificent, truly memorable scenes. The cast and crew are inevitably multi-national, adding at least some seasoning to a bland screenplay. Strong performances in a supporting role are provided by Vittorio Gassman (Anatole), Oscar Homolka (General Kutuzov), and Herbert Lom (Napoleon). Jack Cardiff and Aldo Tonti's cinematography is first-rate. ""All things considered,"" the film is often entertaining despite a running time of 208 minutes.

As his career progressed, his films became increasingly grand in terms of narrative scope and visual bravura...Tolstoy and Vidor tell the epic story through a handful of major characters...As Napoleon Bonaparte prepares to invade Russia, Pierre Bezukhov (Henry Fonda), an aristocrat so liberal in his views, visits his friend Count Rostov (Barry Jones) and his radiant, young daughter Natasha (Audrey Hepburn). They all witness 'those handsome Russian men marching away to fight, to be killed.'When his father dies, Pierre falls under the spell of the attractive Helene (Anita Ekberg) and finds himself unable to resist her passionate response... He marries her even though everybody knows that she's fooling around on him with Dolokhov (Helmut Dantine).His closest friend, Prince Andrei Bolkonsky (Mel Ferrer), achieves success as a soldier under General Kutuzov (Oscar Homolka) but returns wounded, a condition made the worse by the death of his wife in childbirth...With his own marriage ended by the adultery of his woman, Pierre introduces the grieving Andrei to Natasha, and the pair fall in love... But before they can marry, Andrei goes to fight the invading French and the pacifistic Pierre goes along as an observer...The motion picture deals with war and its effect on people... It contains many marvelous pictorial moments as the colorfully uniformed regiments marching through the excellent streets of Moscow; snowy landscapes; a magnificent Ballroom sequence; and most of all, Napoleon's forces at the epic battle of Borodino; the march on Moscow and the tragic retreat of Napoleon's army through the Russian winter...Most of the military side of the story takes place in the second half, and it seems slow to arrive, but the battle of Borodino is fairly well handled... It is focused (through Pierre's eyes) with long shots of the invading and retreating French troops...Audrey Hepburn whose boyish figure provided a refreshing antidote to the film, is lovely as Natasha... Her flaming innocence and blossoming sensuality set her sweet heart ablaze... This charming spirit, with so much enthusiasm and romanticism, is full of life and true love... Hepburn matures from an impulsive, kind-hearted teen-ager, to an understanding woman who uses her courage and impetuousness to love, to care, and to serve...Henry Fonda is pure, brave, and noble... He projects with sincerity the confusion of an honest man caught up in an angry twist of history... He witnesses the horrific events of war, experiencing days of misery as a prisoner of war... His remarkable adventures lead him to understand at least part of the mysteries of life, humanity, love and loyalty... Pierre is strikingly different from others, with a deep love and esteem for his country and his sweetheart...Mel Ferrer is the sensitive prince who doesn't come around until he meets the sweet Natasha... Andrei is intelligent but arrogant... He ignores the feelings of his wife and fails to carry out his responsibility as a husband...Vittorio Gassman is the legendary seducer, darkly handsome, sensuous, magnetic, who lives in a world of debauchery... Anatole is a man dangerous to love, impossible to resist...Herbert Lom is the 'greatest man of Europe' who sees his men walking hardly under fatiguing conditions through the snowy fields of Russia... Napoleon had a tough decision to make...Oskar Homolka is General Kutuzov who forms a reasoned judgment against an enemy who has a larger, more efficient force... It is unclear whether he did this out of weakness or whether it was part of a brilliant strategy with the purpose of drawing Napoleon's army way beyond their means of supply for the winter, which Bonaparte had not prepared for...Anita Ekberg is Helene, the charming and reckless libertine who goes to a world of cheats and insults her husband's ego making his life depressed and miserable...Helmut Dantine is Dolokhov, the officer, challenged for a duel, who puts on view the better side of his character much later...Tulio Carminati is Prince Vasili Kuragine, a man of the world who familiarizes himself with people who are influential and tries to obtain favor from them...Barry Jones is Count Rostov, a loving family man and an excellent friend... He is indulgent towards his family and provides them comforts and luxuries of life...Wilfrid Lawson is Prince Bolkonsky, a despot aristocrat who imposes his authority on his son without caring for his feelings..May Britt is Sonya, the tender young girl who is devoted to the Rostov family and loves Nicholas...John Mills is Platon, the cheerful Russian peasant whose philosophies comfort Pierre...Vidor's 'War and Peace' is massive in scale, faithful to the larger historical events...

This is deffinitely more you romantic version of the story.  Battle scenes are pretty much limited to a fairly impressive, albeit short Borodino sequence.

The movie so oddly constructed, and of course so poor in language and feeling as if not to be spoken of in the same breath with the book, nonetheless has its virtues. Its picture of the opening ball, its world of bright color and costume enabled me to 'image' in my own mind its world as I had not been able to in reading the book.One of the things which most struck me in watching the film was my sense of comparison of the images on the screen, with the images in my mind of the characters as I had somehow 'thought of them' from reading the book.Henry Fonda was certainly not 'Pierre'. He was too thin and did not have the overall bearish strength , the Tolstoyan power that the book makes Pierre have. On the other hand , Audrey Hephburn as Natasha in the film replaced any picture I might have had in my mind, and became 'Natasha'.
