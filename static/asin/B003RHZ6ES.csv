1361082,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B003RHZ6ES,DanD,"[1, 4]","GOOD is one of those movies that, unfortunately, aims too high.  If it had tried to be merely a personal drama set against the rise of Nazism, it would have been spectacular.  Unfortunately, it reaches high, purposely intending to be a commentary on guilt and humanity.  This leads to some contrived dialogue and situations that weigh the movie down.Still, the film has its strong points.  The story of a German professor coping with the pressures to join the Party (and the Party's interest in his novel, and the eugenics preached within), the film provides ample opportunity for its cast to shine.  Viggo Mortensen shines as Professor Halder, giving an understated performance that is admirable.  As his Jewish friend, Jason Isaacs shines; cast against type, he is a wonder in the few scenes he's given.  Jodie Whittaker, as Halder's love interest, holds her own amongst the greats.  The entire cast performs admirably--especially Mark Strong, in his too-brief role.While the performances are stellar, the rest of the film lags behind.  The plot is non-linear at first, and it's hard to tell when the flashbacks stop.  There is an entire subplot with an infirm mother (acted wonderfully by Gemma Jones) is completely unnecessary; she's used to display Halder's humanity, but if the script had been what it should've been, her character wouldn't have been necessary.  These errors are largely unforgivable, given the effort the cast puts into it.  If the movie had been more modest, hadn't reached for the stars, it would've been much stronger, much more streamlined and accessible.  As it is, GOOD is worth seeing for the acting, but as a morality play, it falls too far short.",3,"""I'm a Jew, you're a Nazi.

Michael Elkins""","[8, 18]","Although this film depicted events that occurred in the 1930s in Germany as the Nazis have come into power, it is in many ways a cautionary warning of how easily things can change in any society, including our own, once people, no matter how ""good"" they may be, choose to travel step by step down one path over another.For example, one scene depicted a college literature professor being informed that certain works in his class curriculum were no longer considered acceptable.  At the same time his students were rushing to the classroom window to watch as piles of books were being burned outside.  This scene brought to my mind the recent publicity surrounding the threatened burning of Korans in Gainesville, Florida.  While many probably chalked this up as merely the actions of one misguided individual, there will certainly be others who will now take up his cause.  Recent news stories have also mentioned certain school boards trying to sculpt history books to conform with their own ideas of how American history should be portrayed, rather than how it actually was.  How many of us again took little notice of the story and merely ascribed those actions to a few misguided individuals who, fortunately, live somewhere else?  How many Germans do you think felt the same whenever they read initial news stories of books being burned?One of the main characters in this film, a Jewish psychoanalyst, is at first spared some of the harshest anti-Semitic Nazi measures due to having served in the German army in World War I.  Tragically, any protection that his status as a war veteran provided him was short-lived.  Many news stories during the recent New York Islamic Center controversy have reminded us that many Muslims have served honorably in our military over the past few years.  How many of today's Beckian conspiracy-minded fanatics will ignore the service provided by these individuals and see them merely as having been engaged as mole agents in some sort of anti-American plot?I am certain that many of those drawn to the Nazis in the 1930s felt that they were ""good"" and patriotic citizens.  I am sure that many of the ""good"" Americans waving their Tea Party flags at their rallies feel the same way.  Nevertheless, the same sort of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric being spewed and ingested daily by many of these ""good"" Americans is very similar to the anti-Semitic propaganda that brought the Nazis to power and kept them in power.

1361085,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,B003RHZ6ES,Dr. James Gardner,"[4, 8]","The true story of the Nazi euthanasia movement has yet to be written, much less filmed, and ""Good"" does nothing to improve that situation. It confuses the euthanasia movement with the mass extermination of the Jews, and confuses the timelines for the development of both. It also blurs some of the major contributors to the program.Here is a much abbreviated version of the story -The Nazi euthanasia movement begins in the late 19th Century in the efforts of Americans to improve their medical training in the wake of the deaths during the Civil War. Flash forward to the 1880s and 1890s when American students went to Germany to be educated and came back to the U.S. to eventually head the prominent East coast Medical schools.The euthanasia movement in the U.S. and the mass sterilizations of the ""feebleminded"" was very strong at the turn of the 20th Century. The first law was passed in 1907 in Indiana. The German physicians were in awe of the Americans who took their theories and actually began to apply them.Flash forward to the post WW 1 German emphasis on the ""volk"" and the scapegoats for the loss of the war. Then in 1927 the US Supreme Court upheld sterilization laws. Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote - ""It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.""Sterilization spread like wildfire in the US to the point where 60,000+ people were sterilized. The Carnegie Institution encouraged dissemination of this work throughout the world, but especially in Germany where it found most fertile ground. . It's even quoted in ""Mein Kampf"" which was written in 1924. The Rockefeller Foundation was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund German research, including Dr. Ernst Rudin (who became one of Hitler's right hand men) and Dr. Josef MengeleBack in Germany in 1932 an ambitious Adolph Hitler was making deals with every group he could for their support. The deal with the German Medical Association was to allow them the right to take a life.January 1, 1933. Hitler takes over and his very first act is to give the German physicians the right to terminate life. July 14, 1933. Germany passes the first sterilization laws, setting up more than 200 Hereditary Health Courts. Within 2 years 1% of the population had been sterilized, half for ""feeblemindedness"".The sterilization movement preceded the extermination camps, but the target was the same. As early as 1935 the issue came up (killing the ""life unworthy of life""), but Hitler was reluctant to do anything so severe during peace time, but it was clearly on his agenda when war came. In preparation, Hitler began registering all people with disabilities, assisted by IBM. With the outbreak of the war in September 1939, the extermination of the feebleminded was authorized by Hitler in  October. By August 1941 more than 70,000 people had been killed under the authority of Dr. Karl Brandt and Philip Bouhler (his character appears in the film).To carry out these mass exterminations the Nazi devised various methods including legal injection, carbon monoxide gas delivered in sealed vans, and finally the gas chamber. As the numbers increased so did the targets, now expanded to gypsys, mental patients, relatives of mental patients, and finally soldiers who returned from the Russian front and were severely disabled.As the killings spread, opposition grew, and in the summer of 1941 there were major disruptions and Hitler announced the end of the extermination program. No sooner had the program been closed than the gas chambers were dismantled and shipped to the concentration camps, where their new targets were the Jews.Looked at from the POV of history, it's clear that ""Good"" is a distortion of history. That being said, is it a good film? IMO - no. Mortensen is not convincing as an academic, and since he is in almost every scene, this is a problem. Mortensen is a good actor, but his parts in films like ""Leatherface"", ""Carlito's Way"", ""The Prophecy"", ""Lord of the Rings"", etc. are not exactly Ivory tower types. Indeed, if the purpose of the film is to expose the German academics for their complicity in the holocaust, the near complete absence of any feeling about academia speaks against the value of the film.There are many other problems with the film, including a poor musical score and jumps back and forth in time that can be confusing. But it's not completely worthless - there are fine performances from Jason Issacs as a Jewish friend, Jodie Whittaker as a student, and Mark Strong as Philip Bouhler.It's good to have films about the Nazis and the Holocaust, but they should be good films and they should try to adhere to history. As I said in my opening remarks, the true story of the Nazi euthanasia movement has yet to be written, much less filmed.",2,Distortion of history,1313971200,"08 22, 2011",2011,4918,"['true', 'story',

1361086,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B003RHZ6ES,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","C.P. Taylor's 1981 play GOOD, which is typically performed on an almost bare stage with considerable live music to accompany the story, is very consistently ranked among the finest of twentieth century plays.  Unfortunately, not all plays translate well into movies, and when shorn of its distinctly theatrical style and blown up onto the screen, the result is slow moving and somewhat ho-hum.Set in 1930s Germany, GOOD is the story of likeable professor John Halder (Viggo Mortensen) who must contend with a mentally ill wife and increasingly senile mother.  His relationship with the two has previously inspired a novel that seems to encourage euthanasia, and when the Nazis come to power they seize upon the book as justification for their own, more extreme ideas in that direction.  Although John disapproves of the Nazis, he is flattered by their interest in his work and joins the party in order to produce further writings.  These in turn gain him more prestige, more money, more career opportunities.  He rationalizes his behavior by a sincere belief Hitler is a fool and the more extreme attitudes of the party will ""blow over"" in time.  In the process, he essentially abandons his wife, his mother, and a Jewish friend, and little by little he is drawn further and further into the darkness, all the while convinced that what he does is for a greater good.Several of the supporting players are especially fine, particularly Gemma Jones, Anastasia Hille, and Jodie Whittaker; Jason Isaacs is also excellent.  But the film rests on the shoulders of Mortensen, who seems unable to play the character as a genuinely warm, likeable individual.  Since the major impact of the story rests on our reaction to Mortensen's seduction by the Nazis, Mortensen's failure on this point undercuts the entire film.

GOOD is a film that suggests how the good common people responded to the rise of the Third Reich - the Nazi party with its loathsome guardianship in the Gestapo.  It suggests how personal needs could cloud the mind to see only the benefits of a new order that would eventually destroy millions of people and attempt to transform the world in a new social order. And it is painful to watch the disease progress into every aspect of life in Germany.John Halder (Viggo Mortensen) is a professor of literature and a writer of novels: his latest novel is a fictional story about a man who, out of love for his suffering wife, assists her dying.  This novel catches the eye of Hitler and the Reichminister Bouhler (Mark Strong) who encourages Halder to draft a paper describing how euthanasia is a good and righteous act - a paper that will eventually 'justify' the massacre of Jews and other 'undesirables'. Halder's life is in such upheaval (his mother (Gemma Jones) is dying of tuberculosis while living with Halder and his piano obsessed wife Helen (Anastasia Hille) whom he divorces, Halder finds happiness only with a student Anne (Jodie Whittaker) who is fascinated with the Nazi party, and Halder's only close friend is psychiatrist Maurice Israel Gl&uuml;ckstein (Jason Issacs) who is Jewish and loathes the Nazi party.  Because of Halder's needs in life and also because of the glory he feels being praised for his novel, he agrees to be an 'advisor' to the party. His confr&egrave;res include Adolph Eichmann (Steven Elder) and Josef Goebbels (Adrian Schiller) and slowly the good man John Halder becomes immersed in the Nazi party.Maurice, being Jewish and detesting John's alliance with the Nazis, must escape Germany as the Jewish purge begins.  His only hope is aid from Halder's Nazi affiliation and he desperately seeks Halder's help.  Halder is unable to come to Maurice's aid; Maurice is evacuated and Halder's inspection of the concentration camps makes him face his worse fear about his selling out his morals and honor and his losing his closest friend.GOOD began as a play by C.P. Taylor and was transformed into a screenplay by John Wrathall.  Vicente Amorim directs a cast of mixed experience, but from Mortensen and Isaacs and Jones he draws fine performances.  Throughout the film Halder has aural delusions: at times of stress he hears music, a factor that in retrospect makes us question his own stability.  The music he hears is a sad rewriting of the works of Gustav Mahler -' Die Zwei Blauen Augen von meinem Schatz', and 'O Mensch!'  from the Mahler 3rd Symphony (both sung in English translations by people on the street!), bit and pieces of score quoting phrases from Mahler in a very pedestrian arrangement, and finally orchestral recordings of moments from Mahler's Symphonies No.1 and No.3.  The pedestrian quality of the score weights the film down. The cinematography  by Andrew Dunn is fine (the film was shot in Hungary).  Overall, it feels like this is a strong idea of a statement of what happens to the minds common men in times of crises. For this viewer it simply doesn't accomplish its goal, despite the worthy attempt Viggo Mortensen makes.

The protagonist is a university professor who steadily compromises his principals to get ahead and make his life easier. This is a pretty good topic but it's not explored in the best manner. Some people may have experienced this time in this way but some things seemed quite unlikely.

It isn't immediately clear from the outset that it's his elderly mother in the home, but her role as an antagonist is contrasted beside his Jewish friend and fellow professor, who like himself is a veteran of the first world war.One has to expect that the main plot of a friendship between a Nazi and his marginally Jewish friend (he describes himself) is probably not going to end well.

1361091,A2EBR70V6P9W0N,B003RHZ6ES,"karhill54 ""karhill54""","[4, 5]","MINOR SPOILERS BELOW YOU HAVE BEEN WARNEDViggo Mortensen wonderfully portrays John Halder, a mild-mannered scholar who has no Walter Mitty-like aspirations; he really would just like to be left alone with his books, papers and literature classes. Instead, he's saddled with a demanding and dysfunctional home-life and uncomfortable attention from the Nazis, who ""request"" that he write a serious paper to publicly validate the idea of humane euthanasia about which he wrote a fictional novel some years before. He also has a good friend in psychoanalyst Maurice Gluckstein, who is, of course, Jewish.I was hoping, at least from what I had seen of the trailers, that it would be more about the friendship of the 2 men who are slowly pulled in different directions due to forces neither of them can control. Instead it is really more about John's life of mounting compromise -- his family, his professional life, a political life he does not want -- only one of which is his friendship with Maurice. Of course, as expected it turns out to be the one compromise with which he has the most difficulty. He does come to realize it and try to correct it, but by then it's too late. After that, the movie ends rather abruptly. We never find out what happens to John or Maurice, only where the filmmakers chose to stop filming. In an odd twist, John appears to hallucinate a certain piece of music 3 or 4 times during the film, but it is not explained to the viewer why this happens or how it is significant to John in particular or the film in general.Viggo Mortensen shines and rises above everything he appears in and this is no exception; he portrays the sensitive side of any of his characters so believably. Jason Isaacs gets a part he can really chew on and display his talents away from his tiny, bit-part in the Harry Potter movies, but even here he still gets too little screen time. Everyone else is also very good, especially Gemma Jones as John's mentally and physically ailing mother, who in the end does not die the way you expect her to.

He is dealing with a neurotic wife and demanding children, balancing home and work, and is dedicating time to caring for his increasingly frail and senile mother. Hitler has just come to power. He begins an affair with his student, Anne Hartman, more as a distraction than anything else, and maintains his friendship with Maurice Gluckstein, his former psychoanalyst. He decries Nazi book-burnings and dismisses the Fuhrer as a ""joke.""In an attempt to establish its credibility, the new government is seeking out experts to endorse its policies, and they trip across Johnnie's sensitively written 1920s novel of a husband who aids his terminally ill wife in an assisted suicide.Although Johnnie despises Naziism he is flattered by the attention paid to his novel, and accepts (with misgivings) an honorary commission in the SS. This opens the door to promotions at the University. He becomes Dean of Literature after the former Dean, Herr Mandelbaum ""leaves in such a hurry.""

Grateful perhaps that this odd little story was finally over.In a world where a criminal endeavor on the scale of the 1930's German Nazi movement is even possible, it's good for movies to explore every angle of the human condition. There will always be stories about WWII and they certainly need not all be about action, adventure, daredevil heroes, explosives and the huddled masses. This movie tries to show how an Everyman can be intellectually seduced by such a movement...... but for me it ultimately fails because that man is shown here to abandon all that he purports to hold dear, for seemingly no other reason than the lunatics in charge asked him to do so.

He agrees to write a position paper on euthanasia for the SS and thus begins his slow, but steady downfall as one by one he compromises all that he believes to be good and truthful.So far, so good.  Unfortunately, the film is badly directed and edited.  It moves forward and backward in fits and starts as we get a glimpse at the professor's dysfunctional family life.  At his core the professor is weak and shallow.  His good friend, a Jewish psychiatrist, is systematically destroyed by the Nazis as the professor watches from the sidelines.  The professor, now an SS man himself, has the power to help his friend, but does nothing - a sad commentary on all the ""good"" Germans who watched as their Jewish friends were first persecuted and then murdered.The film tries to show how easy it would be for the average German citizen to be taken in by the Nazis, but the professor's story is confusing and badly told.  His life is a muddle, as is his thinking.

1361108,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B003RHZ6ES,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 4]","Viggo Mortensen is Professor John Halder, a mild-mannered professor teaching literature (including Marcel Proust) at a university in Berlin. It is 1937, at the time of the rise of the Third Reich. One day John is summoned by the head of Nazi Censorship Committee Bouhler (Mark Strong), who tells him John's recent novel (involving the theme of euthanasia) had greatly impressed Hitler himself. Bouhler then asks him to write a paper for the Nazi party.John's best friend is a Jewish psychiatrist named Maurice Gluckstein (Jason Isaacs). Maurice needs a train ticket to Paris, but to buy one he also needs a permit that his friend John, now furthering his political career, can obtain.""Good,"" based on a C. P. Taylor play, is a drama about morality. The film's message is clear and universal, but as a drama the narrative falls flat and most supporting characters remain one-dimensional. The character of Anne, a student attracted to Professor Halder (played by Jodie Whittaker, impressive in ""Venus"" opposite Peter O'Toole) is underwritten, and so is Freddie, a Nazi officer played by Steven Mackintosh.But to me the most disappointing part of the film was the central character Professor John Halder. Viggo Mortensen with his understated performance is not bad, but the way how his character, a ""good"" man seduced by something he initially distances himself from, finally comes to be what he is should be explored more deeply. He is in conflict, but with what?In short, what the film lacks is credible character development in the protagonist, and perhaps equally importantly, confidence in the material the film deals with.",3,A Good Man in 1937 Berlin,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,1625,"['Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Professor', 'John', 'Halder', 'mild-mannered', 'professor', 'teaching', 'literature', 'including', 'Marcel', 'Proust', 'university', 'Berlin', '1937', 'time', 'rise', 'Third', 'Reich', 'One', 'day', 'John', 'summoned', 'head', 'Nazi', 'Censorship', 'Committee', 'Bouhler', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'who', 'John', 'recent', 'novel', 'involving', 'theme', 'euthanasia', 'had', 'greatly', 'impressed', 'Hitler', 'Bouhler', 'then', 'write', 'paper', 'Nazi', 'party.John', 'best', 'friend', 'Jewish', 'psychiatrist', 'named', 'Maurice', 'Gluckstein', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'Maurice', 'train', 'ticket', 'Paris', 'buy', 'one', 'also', 'permit', 'friend', 'John', 'now', 'furthering', 'political', 'career', 'can', 'obtain', 'Good', 'based', 'C.', 'P.', 'Taylor', 'play', 'drama', 'morality', 'film', 'message', 'clear', 'universal', 'drama', 'narrative', 'falls', 'flat', 'most', 'supporting', 'characters', 'remain', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'Anne', 'student', 'attracted', 'Professor', 'Halder', 'played', 'Jodie', 'Whittaker', 'impressive', 'Venus', 'opposite', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'underwritten', 'so', 'Freddie', 'Nazi', 'officer', 'played', 'Steven', 'Mackintosh.But', 'most', 'disappointing', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'central', 'character', 'Professor', 'John', 'Halder', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'understated', 'performance', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'how', 'character', 'good', 'man', 'seduced', 'something', 'initially', 'finally', 'be', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'explored', 'more', 'deeply', 'conflict', 'what', 'short', 'what', 'film', 'credible', 'character', 'development', 'protagonist', 'perhaps', 'equally', 'importantly', 'confidence', 'material', 'film', 'deals']",N/A
