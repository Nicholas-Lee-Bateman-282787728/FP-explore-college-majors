1061546,AQUU8S55JGY2H,B000NY0YJU,Aco,"[6, 7]","What makes Longford work is the focus it has on character instead of history. But it's sparse interest in context also left me wanting more. Almost within a vacuum we see Lord Longford, beautifully portrayed by Jim Broadbent, seek to redeem notorious murderer Myra Hindley, deftly handled by Samantha Morton.His commitment to her rehabilitation and acceptance of Christ effectivelty ruins his career and name, but this film skips over such internalized psychology, instead presenting a man who is pious to a fault and maybe even mentally unable to recognize his critics. There is, among other themes, an interest in psychological instability, and the myopia of piety.But the flip side of social hypocrisy is equally relevant. Regarding our own age (Longford begins in the late 60's, concludes around the turn of the century) the advocacy of Christianity by our leaders (Bush) must be taken with a grain (or two) of salt when looking at their record of governance. Men like Lord Longford are rare. He steadfastly stood by his Christian principals. Based on his love and appreictaion for Christ his interest in prisoners was genuine. Only after recognizing the complexity of Myra Hindley, and the ease with which he could be used, does his mission break out of it's vacuum into the wider world.I honestly was expecting a longer, more historically involved film. Having no knowledge of the Moor Murders, or Longford, when I saw the preview on HBO, I was curious, and thought this would be a 2-part/3-hour piece. It could have been longer, as it is about 90 minutes, and doesn't delve into who the killers were, their motives, the victims, the era, the environment, etc. Nor is there focus on Longford before the crimes. We do see how his relationship to Hindley relates to his wife (the excellent Lindsay Duncan). Their marriage is one of the truly lovely apects of Longford, and offers a key into the man he was. Other than a few scenes (including a terrifc moment at his daughter's book party) his family is cursory, as is the era in England. In this way I did seek more context. There is mention of Longford's family history of mental illness, and no attention is paid to the capture, trial or hysteria of the Moor Murders beyond the jeers Myra Hindley receives throughout the film.Without hestitaion Jim Broadbent is one of our best actors. He always stands out, and can bring pathos to a clown as easily as dignity and honor to a fool. Samantha Morton, who also has never been bad, takes her mutedness to a woman who may be a callous calculating femme fatale, or maybe a mental wreck or merely an ignorant woman, I'm not sure. Andy Serkis is terrific, in two scenes only, as Ian Brady, her accomplice, and the apparent murderer. But the complexity of Brady and Hindley is a not dealt with here, unfortunately.",4,Any regrets?,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,2811,"['What', 'Longford', 'work', 'focus', 'character', 'instead', 'history', 'sparse', 'interest', 'context', 'also', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'Almost', 'vacuum', 'see', 'Lord', 'Longford', 'beautifully', 'portrayed', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'seek', 'redeem', 'notorious', 'murderer', 'Myra', 'Hindley', 'deftly', 'handled', 'Samantha', 'Morton.His', 'commitment', 'rehabilitation', 'acceptance', 'Christ', 'effectivelty', 'career', 'name', 'film', 'such', 'internalized', 'psychology', 'instead', 'presenting', 'man', 'who', 'pious', 'fault', 'maybe', 'even', 'mentally', 'unable', 'recognize', 'critics', 'other', 'themes', 'interest', 'psychological', 'instability', 'myopia', 'piety.But', 'flip', 'side', 'social', 'hypocrisy', 'equally', 'relevant', 'Regarding', 'own', 'age', 'Longford', 'late', '60', 'turn', 'century', 'advocacy', 'Christianity', 'leaders', 'Bush', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'grain', 'two', 'salt', 'when', 'looking', 'record', 'governance', 'Men', 'Lord', 'Longford', 'are', 'rare', 'steadfastly', 'stood', 'Christian', 'principals', 'Based', 'love', 'appreictaion', 'Christ', 'interest', 'prisoners', 'was', 'genuine', 'Only', 'recognizing', 'complexity', 'Myra', 'Hindley', 'ease', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'mission', 'break', 'vacuum', 'wider', 'world.I', 'honestly', 'was', 'expecting', 'longer', 'more', 'historically', 'involved', 'film', 'Having', 'knowledge', 'Moor', 'Murders', 'Longford', 'when', 'saw', 'preview', 'HBO', 'was', 'curious', 'thought', 'would', 'be', '2-part/3-hour', 'piece', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', '90', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'delve', 'who', 'killers', 'were', 'motives', 'victims', 'era', 'environment', 'etc', 'there', 'focus', 'Longford', 'crimes', 'do', 'see', 'how', 'relationship', 'Hindley', 'relates', 'wife', 'excellent', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'marriage', 'one', 'truly', 'lovely', 'apects', 'Longford', 'key', 'man', 'was', 'Other', 'few', 'scenes', 'including', 'terrifc', 'moment', 'daughter', 'book', 'party', 'family', 'cursory', 'era', 'England', 'way', 'did', 'seek', 'more', 'context', 'mention', 'Longford', 'family', 'history', 'mental', 'illness', 'attention', 'paid', 'capture', 'trial', 'hysteria', 'Moor', 'Murders', 'jeers', 'Myra', 'Hindley', 'film.Without', 'hestitaion', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'always', 'out', 'can', 'bring', 'pathos', 'clown', 'as', 'easily', 'dignity', 'honor', 'fool', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'who', 'also', 'never', 'been', 'bad', 'mutedness', 'woman', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'callous', 'calculating', 'femme', 'fatale', 'maybe', 'mental', 'wreck', 'merely', 'ignorant', 'woman', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Andy', 'Serkis', 'terrific', 'two', 'scenes', 'only', 'Ian', 'Brady', 'accomplice', 'apparent', 'murderer', 'complexity', 'Brady', 'Hindley', 'not', 'dealt', 'here', 'unfortunately']",Longford

1061549,A21IS781UXBCLD,B000NY0YJU,Charles Blaine Fielding,"[4, 12]","This is a deeply dishonest and superficial HBO made -for-television movie about a marginal crank who gratutiouly intruded into  the infamous 1960s Moors Child Murders case. To understand the magnitude of Longford's errors it is necessary to understand what really happened and the true character of Myra Hindley's pathology, rather than the film-makers' romantic fantasy of both these evil twins.""Don't... Please God help me"".10 year old Lesley Ann Downey pleading to God as Myra Hindley and Ian Brady abuse her in Hindley's home.Lesley Ann Downey ,age 10, went missing Dec. 26, 1964 after being abducted by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. They took her to Hindley's home where she  was forced to strip naked naked.Writer Colin Wilson describes how: they  took 9  "" photographs of Lesley Ann ... from 6 feet away standing on a bed, naked, legs apart, hands outstretched, clothed in nothing but a pair of socks while Brady and Hindley stood by sneering and laughing"" at her.  The little girl was ""wearing a gag, with a terrified look in her eyes"". At The Gates of Janus 290Lesley Ann's also pleaded on the 17 minute tape Brady and Hindley made: "" ... Ooh, it's cold, can I go home now""?  They had sadistically put her in an unheated room with an open window.When Lesley Ann begged  "" Please don't make me get undressed again"" Myra Hindley  shot back, ""If you don't shut your mouth and stop crying I'll give you another good hiding"".Brady later asserted  that also she insisted Lesley Ann call them mommy and daddy.Lesley's head was caved in by Brady and Hindley. At p.296.THE KEY DOUBLE STANDARD : Longford would have it that the God who ingored Lesley Ann's pleas did grant redemption immediately  to Myra Hindley. If so, Longford's God is Himself a grotesque obscenity.Twelve year-old John Kilbride, another victim of Brady and Hindley,  was buried on the Moors with his pants and underwear pulled down pulled down around his ankles. The 17 year-old  Evans was hacked to death by Brady while Hindley watched.For this and four other child murders,  Myra Hindley received a life sentence. Note the gross disproportion beween Hindley's life imprisonment and the five tortured, terrified and murdered children-  not to mention the pain inflicted on their families. Hindley's punishment was mild indeed compared to her crimes.Her release from prison- so ardently sought by Longford-  would have been an insult and trivialization of the dead children's suffering.Myra Hindley told the police about her relationship to Brady : ""Where he has gone I have gone.""  It does seem implausible that Hindley would have killed on her own. She needed her partner Brady.But  Hindley was Brady's all too willing accomplice, a free moral agent who chose to put her patholgical attachment to Brady above the lives of five children.The only thing Hindley could not abide was Brady's indifference.And  Motive in any event  is not an element of a crime. Only Intent is. Whether she helped Brady torture and kill children to impress him is irrelevant.  And on the tape she is certainly enjoying tormenting little Lesley Ann.Brady and Hindley  are the first of  a depressingly long line  modern child serial killers. And Myra Hindley the first woman serial child killer..Neither British society nor the legal profession were prepared to handle them.Brady and Hindley were cowards who only attacked the most vulnerable.Emlyn Williams  in his study of them stresses Brady's grandiosity. He was a very heay drinker, if not an alcoholic and a bastard.By  abducting and  killing children,  Brady sought to assert a secret  superiority over the helpless children  and Society. See his lording it over the tiny Lesly Ann. And of course his vassel Hindley.  He was a coward and ineffectual. He never made a penny from his grandoise plans.And he and Hindley surrendered meekly to the police.  Both were entirely non- violent in the presence of authority.""What tape"" ? Quote by Longford.The movie assumes Longford is an interesting character. Actually, he was just a silly crank and religious fanatic of the worse kind.Longford was not even  aware of the tape and indifferent to it. His willful ignorance about Hindley went beyond mere stupidity or gullibility to a kind od blissful fantasy romance he invented about Myra Hindley.In his rush to absolve Hindley of all responsibilty for the torture and murder of the  five children, Longford bizarrely ingored all the  the evidence of her participation in the crimes.He exonerated her for crimes that he refused to ascertain had even happened.Yet the movie offers Longford as a laudatory figure for no apparent reason.The buffonish Longford  led a life of easy privilge and unearned deference, a  Bertie Woster of upper class twits.Longford had a grandoise ego as large as Ian Brady's. A morally superior prig, he was actually quite  shallow and  of almost sublimely stupid.After being re-admitted to the Catholic Church {an obscenity in  itself}, Hindley tells Longford: "" at least I know in the eyes of God I am forgiven"". Longford replies: ""Well, if you are forgiven by God who are we to to condemn you""?  Longford purports not only to know God's will, but to be His representative on earth.And who appointed this moral imbecile to speak as we"" ?The dramatic license in ""Longford is a license to kill.The movie- makers posit an ambiguity about Hindley that is non- existent.Both Brady and Hindley were classic psychopaths who wore masks of normality in their trivial daily lives. They were both adept at presenting a facade of normality. They led lives of lower middle class respectibilty and  stupifying banality in Mancheste .Hindley and Brady were  also model employees at the same time they were abducting, torturing and murdering children. .Samantha's Morton's intentionally misleading portrayal of Hindley as soft and feminine. She was in reality mannish and brusque. And a congenital liar.Hindley was simply a self- interested manipulator and liar. She played the gullible Longford liike a violin.Hindley never did anything that was not in her own interest. She lied at the trial in 1966, and she even lied to Longford.And she could have left the relationship with Brady at any time.Now she is a nice young woman"". Longford asserted in the mid- 1980s. But  Hindley had to choice but to be ""well behaved""- compliant- in prison. This is hardly evidence of reform. It is just like her being a good employee from 1963 to 1965, and her otherwise normal life while she moonlighted as a child torturer and killer.So  ho cares whether Hindley ""reformed"" when she no choice ? Many criminals are well- behaved in prison. It is hardly relevant to their conduct outside.Compare the sadistic Dr. Joseph Mengele who  led a blameless life until age 32. Only then did he begin his fiedish medical  ""experiments"" on Jewish children. And they lasted less than two years. After the war he escaped to South America where he led a furtive and harmless life until his death of old age. Did God forgive him too?American serial killer Ted Bundy was a well liked figure in his daily life while killing young women at night, and his long term sleep-in girlfriend wrote a laudatory biography of him even after his crimes had been revealed.Longford asserted too: "" killers of this kind almost always have a prior history of offending"". She did- in fact five times! She started killing when she was age 21. Longford  distorts the facts here yet again.{Longford also hypocritically says ""only God can take a human life"", being completely indifferent to Hindley's having done it five times}.Hindley's life imprisonment was small potatoes compared to  the five children she helped torture and murder.The Law is about secular Justice, not religious redemption. Indeed Redemption is for God- assuming there even is one-  but  in the afterlife.If Longford wants to forgive Hindley- or Adolf Hitler for that matter- is his personal perogative. But he can hardly expect Socity to bow to his his own peculiar brand of theology.And in fact Longford was almost totally isolated in his love for Hindley and his quest to return her to her life of banal normality.No one else- including the Catholic Church-ever supported his quest to free Hindley, except fort his equally ditzy wife.  ""Lady"" Longford however merely revealed herself to be yet another upper- class British twitwith her bizarre- and untrue-  ""feminism"" that assumes women are incapable of Evil unless in thrall to a male.There is no evidence or reason to believe Hindley was ever molested by her father or tried to escape Brady. This is more made-up ""evidence"" by Missus Longford, probably from more self-serving lies by Hindley herself.Ironically, Ian Brady is the most reliable and insightful character in the movie among this motley crew of fools.He knew Hindley for the manipulative liar she is. But- and not surprisingly- Longford rejects his help in order to perserve his fantasy of Hindley's ""redemption"".Brady offers him the letters Hindley wrote, but Longford ignores them.The screenwriter and  director during  their mostly irrelevant commentary on the DVD do not say if Brady's letters from Hindley were geniune. But Brady is shown to have intimate knowledge of Hindley's life in prison. And the letters show she was clearly manipulating Longfoed and regarded him with contempt. Not only did Longford ignore the letters, but he never even questioned Hindley about them. Yet more evidence od what a self- deluded crank he was.So why believe Hindley and not Brady ?{Incidentally, The real Brady was much less that the out-sized monster that the fim-makers created  in the ""Longford"" movie. He was no Nietzchean Superman as he fancied hinself, but a cowardly weakling who attacked only children from ambush, and caved in meekly when confronted by authority}.The film-makers also dishonestly portray the opponents of releasing Myra Hindley as animalistic cretins, while Longford and his screwy wife are  bathed in an aura of holiness and goodness. Not one reasoned advocate of keeping Hindley in prison is ever offered by the film-makers.Longford was  every bit as perverse as Hindley and Brady.  Championing Hindley was a only way for the ego-maniacial Longford to get public attention after his increasing political irrelevancy. Too bad he did not pick a worthy cause to bestow his dubious blessings on. But then no one would have paid him any attention. And attention was what he most obviouly craved.Conclusion:A very shallow and dishonest movie about a very shallow man.that omits key facts and distorts the evidence.Yet the writer and director ask us to admire Longford, though he was merely  a comic buffon of near total ineffectiveness-  except of course  for the further misery he inflicted on the victims' families. But Longford was indiffernt to that- as are the film-makers.Perhaps next they can make a movie about Adolf Hitler's love of dogs.For more truthful accounts of Myra Hindley see:Emlyn Williams, Beyond Belief; a Chronicle of Murder and Its Detection { 1967}. This is still the best account of the Moors Murders written only two years after the murders and baesd on contemorary accounts and interviews.  {Williams was also the author of the play and 1937 movie ""Night Must Fall"" portraying one of the first psychopathic murderers.}""See  No Evil: the Story of the Moors Murders"" {2006} on DVD It also largely ingnores the actual crimes, but is far more factual  in its portrayal of the case, and of Hindley.",1,CHAMPION OF CHILD TORTURERS AND MURDERERS,1226880000,"11 17, 2008",2008,11477,"['deeply', 'dishonest', 'superficial', 'HBO', 'made',

1061550,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000NY0YJU,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[8, 12]","Lord Langford was a lot of things in this film, but to me he succeeded at being one of those things more than any other. His crusades and pet causes may have been wildly misguided, but through them he was able to remind our oh so Christian society just how un-Christian they really are. Jim Broadbent goes above and beyond the call of duty in this HBO movie to play Longford as a conflicted, maddening man who learns the hard way that even the most selfless acts of compassion can bite you in the rear end. And when they do there will always be those there ready to pile on to your failures. The film is the nearest of misses for me as it provides a point by point recreation of this piece of lost history. There seemed to be a lack of energy (or perhaps enthusiasm) for the tale being told, a feeling that it was holding back because if it came on any stronger it might offend all the sensible viewers who had tuned in. I also can't help but worry about HBO's movie department as they seem to have fallen into a creative rut, with one movie after another being a based on a true story character evaluation that is dying to be seen as high art. Of course their work is far better than any other network out there, I would just hate for them to become too predictable.The film starts off many years after the incident in question and shows, none to subtly, that one action in our life can dominate our image forever. Longford had taken on the most undesirable of cases, Myra Hindley (Samantha Morton), child murderer who was scorned nation wide to no end. Pleading and begging day and night Longford tries to win her a second chance. It hurts his career, his marriage, and his public image, but as he says that is ""neither here nor there."" He believes in the Christian value of forgiveness even if nobody else does. Being a fellow bleeding heart I wanted to like this guy, but he just had too many things going against him. When Myra asks for reading material he sends her his autobiography (why not). He devours knowledge but all the while casting an air as though he only does so so that he can be known for his education. He tries to pose as a man of the people but this particular Lord has some gold plated blood running in his veins that he just can't hide. Then he commits the number one sin in my book and declares war on sex, or more specifically pornography. The longer he campaigns for Myra the angrier the resistance becomes. Is he helping or hurting her? Soon Myra is nothing more than a mass murdering pawn in their game to see who can be crowned holiest of them all. Near the end of the film the story takes a Norman Mailer-ish turn for the worse, at least as far as Longford is concerned, but he sticks to his guns and fights for a little bit of understanding in this heartless world of ours.I just can't help but notice that these unfortunate events where somebody wrongfully crusades for a prisoners release are very overblown. Plenty of innocent people are murdered by their government and its death penalty but to that we just shrug. Collateral damage in the war against street thugs. So why does an act of compassion enrage us so much? It is worth thinking about as you watch this film. It is neither good nor bad, it has a no nonsense approach which is fine but weighs down the viewing experience. Broadbent's performance, his best in years, is really the number one reason to tune in. ***",3,A Superb Job By Jim Broadbent,1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,3409,"['Lord', 'Langford', 'was', 'lot', 'things', 'film', 'succeeded', 'being', 'one', 'things', 'more', 'other', 'crusades', 'pet', 'causes', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'wildly', 'misguided', 'was', 'able', 'remind', 'oh', 'so', 'Christian', 'society', 'just', 'how', 'un-Christian', 'really', 'are', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'call', 'duty', 'HBO', 'movie', 'play', 'Longford', 'conflicted', 'maddening', 'man', 'who', 'hard', 'way', 'even', 'most', 'selfless', 'acts', 'compassion', 'can', 'bite', 'rear', 'end', 'when', 'do', 'there', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'ready', 'pile', 'failures', 'film', 'nearest', 'misses', 'point', 'point', 'recreation', 'piece', 'lost', 'history', 'seemed', 'be', 'lack', 'energy', 'perhaps', 'enthusiasm', 'tale', 'being', 'told', 'feeling', 'was', 'holding', 'back', 'came', 'stronger', 'might', 'offend', 'sensible', 'viewers', 'who', 'had', 'tuned', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'worry', 'HBO', 'movie', 'department', 'seem', 'have', 'fallen', 'creative', 'rut', 'one', 'movie', 'being', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'character', 'evaluation', 'dying', 'be', 'seen', 'high', 'art', 'course', 'work', 'far', 'better', 'other', 'network', 'there', 'would', 'just', 'hate', 'become', 'too', 'predictable.The', 'film', 'many', 'years', 'incident', 'question', 'shows', 'none', 'subtly', 'one', 'action', 'life', 'can', 'dominate', 'image', 'forever', 'Longford', 'had', 'taken', 'most', 'undesirable', 'cases', 'Myra', 'Hindley', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'child', 'murderer', 'who', 'was', 'scorned', 'nation', 'wide', 'end', 'Pleading', 'begging', 'day', 'night', 'Longford', 'win', 'second', 'chance', 'career', 'marriage', 'public', 'image', 'neither', 'here', 'there', 'Christian', 'value', 'forgiveness', 'even', 'nobody', 'else', 'Being', 'fellow', 'bleeding', 'heart', 'wanted', 'like', 'guy', 'just', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'going', 'When', 'Myra', 'reading', 'material', 'autobiography', 'why', 'not', 'knowledge', 'while', 'casting', 'air', 'only', 'so', 'so', 'can', 'be', 'known', 'education', 'pose', 'man', 'people', 'particular', 'Lord', 'gold', 'plated', 'blood', 'running', 'veins', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'Then', 'number', 'one', 'sin', 'book', 'war', 'sex', 'more', 'specifically', 'pornography', 'longer', 'Myra', 'angrier', 'resistance', 'becomes', 'helping', 'hurting', 'Soon', 'Myra', 'nothing', 'more', 'mass', 'murdering', 'pawn', 'game', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'crowned', 'holiest', 'end', 'film', 'story', 'Norman', 'Mailer-ish', 'turn', 'worse', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'Longford', 'concerned', 'guns', 'fights', 'little', 'bit', 'understanding', 'heartless', 'world', 'ours.I', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'where', 'somebody', 'wrongfully', 'prisoners', 'release', 'are', 'very', 'overblown', 'Plenty', 'innocent', 'people', 'are', 'murdered', 'government', 'death', 'penalty', 'just', 'shrug', 'Collateral', 'damage', 'war', 'street', 'thugs', 'So', 'why', 'act', 'compassion', 'enrage', 'so', 'much', 'worth', 'thinking', 'watch', 'film', 'neither', 'good', 'bad', 'nonsense', 'approach', 'fine', 'down', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Broadbent', 'performance', 'best', 'years', 'really', 'number', 'one', 'reason', 'tune', '***']",Longford

And though the story is basically about Longford's relationship with the incarcerated Myra Hindley, the film paints a rather complete portrait of a strange man who vacillated during his lifetime among religious beliefs and spoke out strongly for the rights of prisoners and 'unfortunates' who fall out of line with the law all the while riling against pornography and other vices.Jim Broadbent creates a wholly credible Lord Longford in this amazing performance.  Transformed physically to resemble Longford's bizarre appearance, Broadbent manages to convey the spectrum of trust, self-doubt, pity, outrage, compassion and blind religious belief in a manner few actors could match.  The remainder of the cast is equally excellent: Samantha Morton finds every nook and cranny of the enigmatic murderess Myra while Andy Serkis gives a chilling depiction of Ian Brady, her accomplice who knew how to manipulate the government and people as well as the infamously wily Myra.The story is in many ways grounded by the strong forces of Lady Longford (beautifully realized by Lindsay Duncan) and the Lady Tree of Sarah Crowden and Harold Wilson of Robert Pugh.  Hooper knows how to magnify the class differences between the gentry and the working class and his choices of locations and pacing of confrontations both in the prison and in the home and in the court are spot on.This is one of those films for television that teaches us what really fine films can still be.  It is a tremendously moving piece of work and Jim Broadbent will long be remember for this classic role.  Highly recommended for repeated viewing.

1061554,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B000NY0YJU,J from NY,"[2, 2]","Peter Morgan's ""Longfellow"" is not so much an 88 minute chronicle of a string of child murders that took place in 1964 1945, involving Myra Hindley and Ian Brady, two British nihilists who were considered at the time to be evil incarnate, as it is a rigorous and painful study in the limits of redemption and forgiveness.  How monstrous can a person become before the idea of restoring them to a residual goodness seem ridiculous?  Are there individuals who are even undeserving of it?Frank Pakenham, the 7th Earl of Longford, a notorious and controversial member of British Parliament for his unwavering Catholicism and championing of the vilest criminals in history, did not think so.  His performance by Jim Broadbent is so convincing, so eccentric even in the smallest details--he comes across as a neurotic Puritan, loving husband, and saint with a dark side all at the same time--that it feels like a documentary rather than a made for HBO film.Longford begins feverishly corresponding with Myra Hindley(Samantha Morgan)in prison to the disappointment and confoundment of his family and friends.  He insists to the press that this child murdereress and seemingly deeply evil woman was nothing more than a pawn in the scheme of Ian Brady (Andy Serkis, whose character is so sick and almost humorously depraved that he may as well have jumped out of a Sex Pistols' rock biography).Each scene in which Longford visits Hindley reflects two things: a genuine compassion for the young woman who to all outward intents has destroyed herself, her life, and the lives of others.  Also, though, Morgan implies some strange attraction between the two of them which is very disturbing.  Whether this was actually the case is not known, of course, and should certainly not be assumed.  Hindley converts to Catholicism turns her prison cell into a virtual shrine, insisting on attending Mass every chance she gets in prison.  Brady insists to Longford that it is all an act and that she is laughing at him in secret, though we never do know.  Even Longford's wife begins to feel some compassion for her as she sees the horrible treatment Hindley receives in prison.The crux of the movie is when it is revealed that Hindley and Brady killed more children then was previously disclosed.  For one minute, as Hindley looks at Longford, we see the killer and not the ""innocent young girl"" or candidate for rehabilitation.  She decides to drop Longford as a legal representative and simply walks away.  Longford endures harassment as never before.Still, he holds to his guns and never denounces Hindley entirely.  The end of the film is an example of real Christianity, as years later Hindley and Longford sit together on a bench outside prison.  Lord Longford was one of those rare specimens of Catholics who devoted his life, staked his reputation and career, on the Gospels.

1061555,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000NY0YJU,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[19, 21]","Well, writer Peter Morgan is certainly having a banner year.  Having written screenplays that helped win Helen Mirren and Forest Whitaker Oscars (for ""The Queen"" and ""The Last King of Scotland"" respectively), he has also penned ""Longford.""  ""Longford,"" first broadcast in the US on HBO, will almost certainly create Emmy buzz for its star, Jim Broadbent, come the end of the TV season.  So as you might expect from his previous works, then, Morgan's ""Longford"" is a literate character study based on real events.  The infamous ""Moors Murders,"" a series of child killings that plagued England in the mid-sixties, was the basis for sending Myra Hindley and her paramour to prison.  Hindley, played by Samantha Morton, was reviled by the populace--but when she contacted an elderly aristocrat named Lord Longford to visit her, he did.  Longford (Broadbent) was an activist for prisoner's rights and sought to reform and redeem the less fortunate.  Forming an unlikely, and unpopular, friendship with Hindley--Longford soon becomes a chief advocate in helping her seek parole.  The film creates a noteworthy psychological interplay between the two, and demonstrates Longford's commitments to his ideals--even in challenging ethical situations.I felt, throughout the production, that I was supposed to be drawing relevant parallels to the modern world.  But I was never able to take ""Longford"" at anything other than face value.  It's an interesting portrait of a man who championed unlikely causes.  It's a look at a bit of British history that is distinguished by one notable individual who stood up for his principles when it was not in fashion to do so.  Ultimately, Longford's naivete and guilelessness coexist with his well-meaning nature--and that is his undoing.  The film paints a vivd portrait as Longford's credibility suffers through the years and a respected advocate turns into a relic of days gone by.  Certainly the film comments on reform and conversion, on the penal system, on sexism, on the nature of criminality, on the corruption of innocence--but these observations aren't particularly revelatory.  But, even at face value, this bittersweet character study is worth a look--if for no other reason then for the performances of everyone involved.Broadbent, as always, delivers.  Those who had the pleasure of viewing BBC's ""The Street"" will note a few similarities between the two Broadbent roles.  He seems, late in life, to be embracing idealistic characters that must confront the realities of a modern world.  Morton is fascinating as the enigmatic Myra Hindley.  Intelligent and well-spoken, she is believable both as a victim and as a murderer.  Andy Serkis, as her partner in crime, is just convincing enough to undermine Hindley's claims of redemption--which adds a level of complexity to the proceedings.  And Lindsay Duncan is understated and compelling as Longford's saintly wife.  All in all, the performances bring this small character piece to life.As I've said, I appreciated ""Longford"" for its depiction of an interesting case in British criminality.  The larger issue of forgiveness, and who is worthy of it, is a central theme within the film.  But while Longford is an admirable character, his notion of forgiveness and his portrait, in general, are of an antiquated naivete that just don't translate to how I view modern circumstances.  So while I enjoyed the story of ""Longford,"" it didn't leave me with a ""meaningfulness"" that I believe was intended.  But perhaps I'm just jaded.  Still, check it out for nice performances and interesting characters.

1061557,A2UIXU97JYCPZG,B000NY0YJU,R. Albin,"[4, 5]","This very well made film is quietly effective study of a confrontation between good and evil.  Frank Pakenham, the 7th Earl of Longford, was committed to visiting and assisting prisoners.  A deeply religious man who sought to redeem the prisoners he visited, Longford became an advocate for Myra Hindley, a woman implicated in one of the most notorious serial murders in recent British history.  Hindley, portrayed extremely well by Samantha Morton,emerges as a sly and calculating creature bent on using Pakenham's reputation to her advantage.  Pakenham, as portrayed brilliantly by Jim Broadbent, is a slightly otherworldy figure whose apparent naivete derives in large measure from his profound religious commitment.  There is nothing dramatic about the confrontation between Pakenham and Hindley.  The conflict between good and evil is mundane and depicted unsentimentally.  At the end, viewers are left with a strong impression of the strength, and limitations, of good in the face of evil.",4,Excellent Character Study; 4.5 Stars,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,995,"['very', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'quietly', 'effective', 'study', 'confrontation', 'good', 'evil', 'Frank', 'Pakenham', '7th', 'Earl', 'Longford', 'was', 'committed', 'visiting', 'assisting', 'prisoners', 'deeply', 'religious', 'man', 'who', 'sought', 'redeem', 'prisoners', 'visited', 'Longford', 'became', 'advocate', 'Myra', 'Hindley', 'woman', 'implicated', 'one', 'most', 'notorious', 'serial', 'murders', 'recent', 'British', 'history', 'Hindley', 'portrayed', 'extremely', 'well', 'Samantha', 'Morton', 'sly', 'calculating', 'creature', 'bent', 'using', 'Pakenham', 'reputation', 'advantage', 'Pakenham', 'portrayed', 'brilliantly', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'slightly', 'otherworldy', 'figure', 'apparent', 'naivete', 'derives', 'large', 'measure', 'profound', 'religious', 'commitment', 'nothing', 'dramatic', 'confrontation', 'Pakenham', 'Hindley', 'conflict', 'good', 'evil', 'mundane', 'depicted', 'unsentimentally', 'end', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'strong', 'impression', 'strength', 'limitations', 'good', 'face', 'evil']",Longford
