497444,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00000F3FP,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[3, 4]","Tommy Lee Jones excels in this seedy, depressing biopic about Gary Gilmore, a violence-prone petty criminal who found infamy as the first person executed in the United States after a federal ban on the death penalty was lifted in 1976.  Gilmore was a classic American grotesque -- a high school dropout who fell into an life of crime and was repeatedly arrested and jailed, he became a hardened criminal and a sociopath who lashed out thoughtlessly time and time again, culminating in two senseless murders, just months after his release in 1976 from a twelve-year stint in prison. Yet he was also utterly unremarkable, one of countless thousands of losers who think nothing of violence and aggression, a creepy guy who just happened to be sent to death row when the tides were changing on the issue of capital punishment.First broadcast in 1982, five years after Gilmore was executed, this film is skillfully rendered and quite depressing, showing Gilmore's fitful attempts to reintegrate into society, his failures, and his mounting anger as his life grinds to a halt despite his newfound freedom. Jones is all  twitchiness and hot-headed reaction, a restless bundle of nervous, blind, stupid anger -- his performance deservedly won an Emmy award, having created one of the most repellent, queasy characters to ever hit the small screen. The middle section of the film follows Gilmore's romance with a single-mother local biker chick (played by Rosanna Arquette), a haphazard relationship that swiftly descends into domestic violence and triggers a cycle of blind aggression, ending with two cold-blooded murders, and Gilmore's inevitable arrest.The question of course is whether this film glamorizes murder, or if it provides any useful insights or social commentary. The answer to both of these questions is a little bit yes, and a little bit no. It is a very well-crafted, compelling production. The ensemble cast is strong, and Jones's depiction of a bumbling, semi-catatonic sociopath is impressive. The rawness of the sexual content and the realistic use of curse words (I watched the ""Director's Cut"" version) is a bit shocking, even at this late date in our violence-saturated media culture. But the film doesn't really glamorize Gary Gilmore, or his actions, and doesn't build a cult of personality around him the way that, say, films about the Zodiac Killer or Ed Gein might do. Gilmore is about as un-sexy and unattractive a man as possible, a loser adrift in an unappealing white trash subculture who can think of nothing better to do than pick up a gun and exorcise his own frustrations by carelessly killing two complete strangers. Likewise, the murders he commits are casual and thoughtless, and occupy little time onscreen. If anything, this film could be seen as a comment on the banality of evil, writ small, showing just how dull and just how common murder and violence can really be... A thought that, in its way, is even more chilling than the more amped-up murderers-are-cool imagery that dominates contemporary American popular culture. I wouldn't say that this is a particularly enriching movie -- there are better things to spend you time on -- but it is not sensationalistic and it does have some heft to it. Worth checking out, although it will probably mostly appeal to crime story aficianados and serial-killer buffs.",5,A skillful telling of an ugly tale,1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,3348,"['Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'excels', 'seedy', 'depressing', 'biopic', 'Gary', 'Gilmore', 'violence-prone', 'petty', 'criminal', 'who', 'found', 'infamy', 'first', 'person', 'executed', 'United', 'States', 'federal', 'ban', 'death', 'penalty', 'was', 'lifted', '1976', 'Gilmore', 'was', 'classic', 'American', 'grotesque', 'high', 'school', 'dropout', 'who', 'fell', 'life', 'crime', 'was', 'repeatedly', 'arrested', 'jailed', 'became', 'hardened', 'criminal', 'sociopath', 'who', 'lashed', 'out', 'thoughtlessly', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'culminating', 'two', 'senseless', 'murders', 'just', 'months', 'release', '1976', 'twelve-year', 'stint', 'prison', 'was', 'also', 'utterly', 'unremarkable', 'one', 'countless', 'thousands', 'losers', 'who', 'think', 'nothing', 'violence', 'aggression', 'creepy', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'sent', 'death', 'row', 'when', 'tides', 'were', 'changing', 'issue', 'capital', 'punishment.First', 'broadcast', '1982', 'five', 'years', 'Gilmore', 'was', 'executed', 'film', 'skillfully', 'rendered', 'quite', 'depressing', 'showing', 'Gilmore', 'fitful', 'attempts', 'reintegrate', 'society', 'failures', 'mounting', 'anger', 'life', 'halt', 'newfound', 'freedom', 'Jones', 'twitchiness', 'hot-headed', 'reaction', 'restless', 'bundle', 'nervous', 'blind', 'stupid', 'anger', 'performance', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Emmy', 'award', 'having', 'created', 'one', 'most', 'repellent', 'queasy', 'characters', 'ever', 'hit', 'small', 'screen', 'middle', 'section', 'film', 'Gilmore', 'romance', 'single-mother', 'local', 'biker', 'chick', 'played', 'Rosanna', 'Arquette', 'haphazard', 'relationship', 'swiftly', 'domestic', 'violence', 'cycle', 'blind', 'aggression', 'ending', 'two', 'cold-blooded', 'murders', 'Gilmore', 'inevitable', 'arrest.The', 'question', 'course', 'film', 'murder', 'useful', 'insights', 'social', 'commentary', 'answer', 'questions', 'little', 'bit', 'yes', 'little', 'bit', 'very', 'well-crafted', 'compelling', 'production', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'strong', 'Jones', 'depiction', 'bumbling', 'semi-catatonic', 'sociopath', 'impressive', 'rawness', 'sexual', 'content', 'realistic', 'use', 'curse', 'words', 'watched', 'Director', 'Cut', 'version', 'bit', 'shocking', 'even', 'late', 'date', 'violence-saturated', 'media', 'culture', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'glamorize', 'Gary', 'Gilmore', 'actions', ""n't"", 'build', 'cult', 'personality', 'way', 'say', 'films', 'Zodiac', 'Killer', 'Ed', 'Gein', 'might', 'do', 'Gilmore', 'un-sexy', 'unattractive', 'man', 'possible', 'loser', 'adrift', 'unappealing', 'white', 'trash', 'subculture', 'who', 'can', 'think', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'pick', 'up', 'gun', 'exorcise', 'own', 'frustrations', 'carelessly', 'killing', 'two', 'complete', 'strangers', 'Likewise', 'murders', 'are', 'casual', 'thoughtless', 'occupy', 'little', 'time', 'onscreen', 'anything', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'comment', 'banality', 'evil', 'writ', 'small', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'dull', 'just', 'how', 'common', 'murder', 'violence', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'thought', 'way', 'even', 'more', 'chilling', 'more', 'amped-up', 'murderers-are-cool', 'imagery', 'contemporary', 'American', 'popular', 'culture', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'particularly', 'enriching', 'movie', 'are', 'better', 'things', 'spend', 'time', 'not', 'sensationalistic', 'have', 'heft', 'checking', 'out', 'will', 'probably', 'mostly', 'appeal', 'crime', 'story', 'aficianados', 'serial-killer', 'buffs']",N/A

497453,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00000F3FP,Linda Linguvic,"[3, 3]","Adapted from his bestselling 2000 page book written in 1979, Norman Mailer wrote this screenplay produced in 1982 in two versions: one in two parts for a TV audience and another as a full length movie for a European audience.  I'm not sure which version I watched on Netflix last night but the amount of violence and explicit romantic scenes make me think it was the European version.  That said, I must say I was immediately pulled right into the story with its background of country music which I love and its feeling of a gritty Utah working class down-and-out environment.Tommy Lee Jones won an Emmy for his role as Gary Gilmore, the ex-con who, in 1976 was the first person executed for murder after the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty.  He became a media sensation then because he actively sought his own execution.  However, when the film starts, he has just been released from a 12-year stint in prison.  His cousin, played by Christine Lehtl, and his boss at a shoemaking shop, played by Eli Wallach, want to give him a chance.  But from the beginning the audience can see that Gilmore is a little strange and prone to aggressive behavior.  He wants a woman but just doesn't know the right way of getting one.  He wants to keep his job but picks fights with his coworkers.  The audience can see that in just a moment he can turn weird and a little ""off"".  And yet, there is a side of him that is boyish and just wants to be loved.  We rejoice when he falls in love with Roseanne Arquette, a young welfare mom with two small children.  Their romance is hot and violent as both of them are rather desperate wounded souls, but both are sympathetic characters caught up in a world of hard knocks.When Gilmore needs money he turns to robbery.  But his violent streak comes out when, in two separate incidents, he murders the clerks who had willingly turned over their cash.  He is soon caught then and arrested.

Gary Gilmore, played by Tommy Lee Jones, murders two individuals in two separate robberies and, by his own election, becomes the first person put to death in the United States since the U.S. Supreme Court ended a moratorium on the death penalty.  This film takes a look back at who this man was.  Sure, it only covers the last nine months of his life, but it's still quite a window.  For me, it was interesting to see Tommy Lee Jones in a role before he became a big-budget movie star (this movie was made a few years before I was even born.)  He definitely had his acting chops down by then as he allowed for some sympathy to be extended to this murderous thief.  I do have trouble believing that Gilmore killed those two men for his girl, Nicole Baker.  I can believe that he killed them in part because he was angry that she broke up with him, but beyond that...I guess I might just not know enough about this story.

The acting in this movie is great, but unfortunately with 50 minutes of the original film removed - and those weren't just 50 minutes of extraneous scenes, nudity, swearing etc.  but rather 50 minutes of scenes that tell the story and explain parts of the plot! - this film isn't worth watching.The soundtrack has also been messed up.  In the original film when Gary is in a van heading to the execution chamber, the song ""Una Paloma Blanca"", a very bouncy polka with lyrics about being free as ""a bird in the sky"", that was a big hit in the 70s, comes on the car radio.  The driver asks Gary if he's sure he wants that on and Gary says yes and laughs, enjoying the irony as the van bumps along with the song playing.  That was a fantastic scene.  In the ""director's cut"", the song that comes on is some country dirge (Waylon Jennings maybe?) about being too beaten down to ""get it up again"" that loses all the irony of the original.  When Gary says to leave it on, he looks at the priest and laughs as the song goes on about ""getting it up"" and it sounds like a dumb dirty joke - you feel like the priest is uncomfortable because of the double entendre in the lyrics.  Ruined the entire scene.Very frustrating, and not at all a credit to the director!
