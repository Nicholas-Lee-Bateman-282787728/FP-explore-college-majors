Martin Sloan stops for service, then decides to walk to his old home town. He stops at a drugstore for an ice cream soda, still a dime. Life is slow paced, as in past decades. People live in big houses along main street. A boy uses a knife to carve his name in a wooden post. The couple at his old house don't recognize him! A brand new 1934 roadster! ""Who are you?"" He is told to go away from his old house. Martin jumps on a merry-go-round, there is an accident. The boy will be alright. ""I know who you are."" Do people only get one chance? ""Try looking ahead."" He returns to the drugstore. Things have changed. Martin goes back to his car and drives away.Kick the Can, 02-09-1962An old man says goodbye to the other residents at an old age home, his son came to get him. But there was a misunderstanding. Boys play ""kick the can"" outside. It annoys some of the elderly, they don't like noise. Does time affect people's outlook? Or is it a way of looking at things? Can you become young by acting young? Will he be put in a special ward? [We now know that some exercise keeps you young.] At night Charles rouses the others to play outside. Are you ever too old to play? Is he serious? Can they leave unobserved? The manager is notified. Who are those kids? Where did the old people go?The lesson here is that a sedentary life can bring on aging. People should stay active as long as possible. Being in an old age home is like a jail without bars. Living with your children is better than in a home where you wonder who will die next.

A shock to himself when he sees himself, as a boy, carving names into a post on a gazebo..( a gazebo that could have been possibly in Serling's home town of Binghamton New York.The quagmire of time and space are now imposed on Martin Sloan..and this unique teleplay is one of the best 26 minutes you might see on Television.

295875,A7Y6AVS576M03,6302098548,gobirds2,"[5, 5]","WALKING DISTANCE is probably the best episode ever produced. Gig Young acts out Serling's prose so perfectly that he speaks for every man that ever wished he could go home again. It is a very moving episode. Bernard Herrmann's score intuitively picks up the emotion and heartfelt sincerity that Serling wrote into this story. This was Rod Serling's, Bernard Herrmann's and Gig Young's finest work for any medium. I think it is the finest piece of work ever put on film. KICK THE CAN is thematically similar and also very moving. It examines what it means to grow old and if one must give up the very things that makes us who we really are.

295876,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6302098548,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","In Rod Serling's classic episode &quot;Walking Distance,&quot; Martin Sloan (Gig Young) leaves his car at the gas station and walks into his hometown, where suddenly everything is just as it was when he was a child. In fact, he encounters his younger self (Michael Montgomery), and has to come to terms with the fact that he has not been happy with his life for a long, long time. The episode, directed by Robert Stevens, is one of Serling's best evocations of nostalgia, with a cast that includes Pat O'Malley and young Ronnie Howard. &quot;Kick the Can&quot; was George Clayton Johnson's final script for the series, and was the episode adapted by Steven Spielberg in &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie.&quot; Charles Whitley (Ernest Truex) and his friend Ben Conory (Russell Collins) are residents of Sunnydale Rest, a home for the aged. Charles becomes convinced that the secret to being young is acting young, and one night he begs the others to join him for a game of kick-the-can. Everyone agrees to join in the game, except Ben. Because this is the Twilight Zone, this is a tragic mistake and one that Ben will regret the rest of his life.

295877,A31QEAZMJWBF28,6302098548,NMdesapio,"[1, 1]","Often called the greatest episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE ever made, ""Walking Distance"" epitomizes the series at its finest.  Everything about the episode is extraordinary:  the script, which is Rod Serling's most personal; the acting by Gig Young, Frank Overton, Ronnie Howard, and the rest of the cast; the direction by Robert Stevens; the photography by George T. Clemens; and the moving score by Bernard Herrmann, which could stand on its own as a concert piece.  Serling's emotional identification with this story of a tired advertising man who revisits his old hometown in a desperate effort to ""put in a claim to the past"" is clearly audible in his narrations, particularly the middle one (""A man can think a lot of thoughts...""), in which he sounds close to tears.  Other reviewers have called ""Walking Distance"" the finest study of humanity ever put on television - and I can believe that this is true.The theme of ""Kick the Can,"" the second episode on this video, is also that of a mature man reencountering youth (the episode even uses some of Herrmann's music from ""Walking Distance"").  Old friends Charles Whitley and Ben Conroy live at Sunnyvale Rest, a home for the aged.  Abandoned by his son and threatened with confinement by the home's doctor, who thinks him ""senile,"" Charles realizes that it will take a children's game, such as ""kick the can,"" to save him from a fate akin to death.  But will his best friend Ben join him in The Twilight Zone?  ""Kick the Can"" is a charming, magical piece, even if it does pale a bit next to ""Walking Distance,"" which is greatness itself.",5,"""Somewhere up the road, he's looking for sanity""",1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,1590,"['Often', 'called', 'greatest', 'episode', 'THE', 'TWILIGHT', 'ZONE', 'ever', 'made', 'Walking', 'Distance', 'series', 'finest', 'Everything', 'episode', 'extraordinary', 'script', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'most', 'personal', 'acting', 'Gig', 'Young', 'Frank', 'Overton', 'Ronnie', 'Howard', 'rest', 'cast', 'direction', 'Robert', 'Stevens', 'photography', 'George', 'T.', 'Clemens', 'moving', 'score', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'could', 'stand', 'own', 'concert', 'piece', 'Serling', 'emotional', 'identification', 'story', 'tired', 'advertising', 'man', 'who', 'old', 'hometown', 'desperate', 'effort', 'put', 'claim', 'past', 'clearly', 'audible', 'narrations', 'particularly', 'middle', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'think', 'lot', 'thoughts', 'close', 'tears', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'called', 'Walking', 'Distance', 'finest', 'study', 'humanity', 'ever', 'put', 'television', 'can', 'believe', 'true.The', 'theme', 'Kick', 'Can', 'second', 'episode', 'video', 'also', 'mature', 'man', 'reencountering', 'youth', 'episode', 'even', 'Herrmann', 'music', 'Walking', 'Distance', 'Old', 'Charles', 'Whitley', 'Ben', 'Conroy', 'live', 'Sunnyvale', 'Rest', 'home', 'aged', 'Abandoned', 'son', 'threatened', 'confinement', 'home', 'doctor', 'who', 'senile', 'Charles', 'will', 'take', 'children', 'game', 'such', 'can', 'save', 'fate', 'akin', 'death', 'will', 'best', 'friend', 'Ben', 'join', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Can', 'charming', 'magical', 'piece', 'even', 'pale', 'bit', 'next', 'Walking', 'Distance', 'greatness']",The Twilight Zone: Walking Distance/ Kick the Can VHS
295878,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,6302098548,William Timothy Lukeman,"[1, 1]","As previous reviewers have said, here are two of the finest episodes of a TV series known for its exceptional quality & human insight. Both start at the same point: a man looking back on the past, one from midlife, one from old age. Both men have been disappointed, worn down -- their lives haven't taken them to the promised place of fulfilled hopes & expectations. And both are given a second chance, although in very different ways.In ""Walking Distance,"" Martin Sloan (a superb Gig Young) finds himself yearning for his idyllic childhood, and suddenly finds himself walking through it as a grown man. It's a quiet but powerful story, one that any viewer should find evocative -- but if you're Martin's age, it'll resonate deeply indeed. Not simply a cautionary tale about living too much in the past, it also offers what so many grown men undoubtedly hunger for: the chance to speak with their fathers openly & honestly, man-to-man, each in the prime of life. If you've lost your father, this story will strike an almost unbearably beautiful, bittersweet chord.In ""Kick the Can,"" Charles Whitley (Ernest Truex) waits out his remaining days in an old folks' home, abandoned by his son, feeling the weight of his years but unwilling to simply fade away. He also remembers his childhood -- but in his case, it's not an unhealthy flight from the present into the past. Charles remembers the energy, the joy, the wonder of experiencing the world for the first time ... and he's sure there's a way to recapture it. The well-meaning owners of the home only see him as an old man, the little that's left of a long life. Charles still knows himself to be the sum of that long life, with all of its sorrows & wisdom.On the face of it, two obvious lessons that everyone knows: don't live in the past, and remain young at heart. But the writing, the acting, the cinematography, and the music all combine to make these two stories something special, something that remains with you long after the closing credits. There's nothing mawkish or sentimental here, no easy clich&eacute;s to make everyone feel better. This is the stuff of life, poignant & heartfelt.
