880913,AEC3P2F88AAJ6,B0007ICRF6,"Andrew J. McCabe ""comicattack""","[6, 34]","This is the WORST ""Wizard of Oz"" adaption ever! For starters to play devils advocate, I can give Baum a break. At this point Wizard of Oz the book, was already a lil bit over 25 years old. As an artist myself I could safely say that something I did 25 years ago, I'd have no problem letting my son re-write to try and re-invent it. Too bad his child screwed it up big time! He co-wrote it with the director, and totally butcherd the entire story and stuck tons of slap stick in there to make it more Charlie Chaplin-ish! The story was thrown out the window totaly and the only thing that remained was the characters (and even they werent intact and butchered quite well).The dvd sucks major ass too! The original organ pipe score wasn't secured, and so we're left with what sounds like 5 college kids in a room trying to make music on their labtops. Also they added in a narrator to read the title cards, THE POINT OF A SILENT FILM IS NO TALKING, IF THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE DAMN TITLE CARDS THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE!If you want to see a true gold Wizard of oz, check out ""The Majestic Scarecrow of Oz"", directed by Baum himself 9 years before this. The only intrest one could take in this dvd is either a film historian (and if I was you, I'd wait for a better version to come out) or to watch this movie to actually see how bad it is (It could be the Ed Wood flick of silent films)",1,"The ""Ed Wood Flick"" of Silent FIlms",1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,1412,"['WORST', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'adaption', 'ever', 'starters', 'play', 'devils', 'advocate', 'can', 'give', 'Baum', 'break', 'point', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'book', 'was', 'already', 'lil', 'bit', '25', 'years', 'old', 'artist', 'could', 'safely', 'say', 'something', 'did', '25', 'years', 'ago', ""'d"", 'have', 'problem', 'letting', 'son', 're-write', 'try', 're-invent', 'Too', 'bad', 'child', 'screwed', 'up', 'big', 'time', 'co-wrote', 'director', 'totally', 'butcherd', 'entire', 'story', 'stuck', 'tons', 'slap', 'stick', 'there', 'make', 'more', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin-ish', 'story', 'was', 'thrown', 'out', 'window', 'totaly', 'only', 'thing', 'remained', 'was', 'characters', 'even', 'werent', 'intact', 'butchered', 'quite', 'well', '.The', 'dvd', 'sucks', 'major', 'ass', 'too', 'original', 'organ', 'pipe', 'score', 'was', ""n't"", 'secured', 'so', ""'re"", 'left', 'what', '5', 'college', 'kids', 'room', 'trying', 'make', 'music', 'labtops', 'Also', 'added', 'narrator', 'read', 'title', 'cards', 'POINT', 'OF', 'A', 'SILENT', 'FILM', 'IS', 'NO', 'TALKING', 'IF', 'THERE', 'WAS', 'SUPPOSED', 'TO', 'BE', 'TALKING', 'WE', 'WOULD', ""N'T"", 'HAVE', 'THE', 'DAMN', 'TITLE', 'CARDS', 'THERE', 'IN', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'PLACE', 'want', 'see', 'true', 'gold', 'Wizard', 'oz', 'check', 'Majestic', 'Scarecrow', 'Oz', 'directed', 'Baum', '9', 'years', 'only', 'intrest', 'one', 'could', 'take', 'dvd', 'film', 'historian', 'was', ""'d"", 'wait', 'better', 'version', 'come', 'out', 'watch', 'movie', 'actually', 'see', 'how', 'bad', 'could', 'be', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'flick', 'silent', 'films']",The Wizard Of OZ

Generally I try to keep my reviews balanced but I can't really do that.  I'm just going to spew bullet points.* This one is old enough that it's the old black and white, silent, flickering barely-there video.  Delightful!* The music, which is generally piano music in this era, has been replaced by some sort of vague electronica.  I don't know for SURE but I cannot imagine this is contemporary.  It repeats endlessly for about the first ten minutes, then it goes to piano in the middle of a scene and then back to the same repeating electronica.  It's almost as if they've lost some of the original audio?* There's a narrator... she reads the cards, often incorrectly in this rather chipper feminine voice that doesn't really match the tone of the movie.* Oliver Hardy (you know, of Laurel and Hardy) is in here as the Tin Man (woodsman).  He's almost recognizable.* Quite a few racist bits; the one that stands out is a young African American boy sitting in a watermelon patch eating an entire quarter of a watermelon.* Surprisingly slapstick.  This one has very little to do with the plot as we know it.  You know the sort of stuff I'm talking about: a guy gets kicked in the rear by a mule, he flies impossibly high into the air and lands in a cactus patch.  (I'm not making this up, actual scene from the movie).In summary, if not for the music and narrator I would have considered this a grand example of the silent cinema.
