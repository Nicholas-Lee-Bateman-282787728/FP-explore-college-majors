909805,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B0009OUBD8,Anton Ilinski,"[17, 20]","The movie is really terrible - not by its quality but by its content. A teenage girl is murdered in her room during the night. Next day the parents and their two other kids are taken to the police for interrogation. And 14-year old Michael falls under suspicion. From now on the most horrible begins for the family which already has to deal with desperation and grief after the death of their daughter, separation in the police precinct, multiple interrogations and mistrust. Detectives don't care about the truth - they need only a confession from frightened and coursed boy. And we all know cops can get a confession if they REALLY want to...The movie demonstrates quite vividly how the juridical system works (and I'm pretty sure not only in the U.S. but in the whole world) and this demonstration frightens. It frightens you a lot. While watching you experience everything that's going on just like it happens to you and feel real pain, anger and despair. Much of it because of a compelling actors' work.Now we get quite an understandable explanation why most people don't like cops - because those who have power often use it not to help us as they ought to but to make their own work easier. To me the most significant were the father's words in the end of the film: ""What are we supposed to do now if something happens? Call emergency? THOSE cops?""Looks like our world is the place where you can't expect help from those whose job is to help. We just have to hope nothing bad happens at all. ""The Interrogation of Michael Crowe"" is very truthful and strong piece of work.

909806,ACIMDUGLJR99V,B0009OUBD8,"Craig - Indian Wells, CA","[0, 7]","This movie is the worst ""True Crime"" movie I have ever seen. I think more than anything because it is a very disturbing and probably factual movie. Frankly I had to finally stop watching it after about a third of the way through. Even if this was most likely how these monstrous police interrogators were (and I am absolutely sure they probably were worse), I got the point early on that the whole family was being harassed and especially Michael. Maybe I enjoy more of a positive light in a movie, but I didn't need SO much demonstration of how awful the police were and can be. I really did get the point early on that there are police investigators out there who don't seek the truth, but seek an early completion of the investigation so they can file their report and go home to dinner. ""Swift"" justice does not always equal ""true"" justice. It would have been much better if they depicted the police harrassment to a lesser point and then showed the eventual true justice that came to this family and the victim. The movie became too boring to continue to watch. I may try again and fast forward through all the evil cop scenes and watch the vindication of Michael. My heart does go out to this family, though and only shows that there are police who let their power get the most of them.",1,"Boring, but disturbing",1282348800,"08 21, 2010",2010,1292,"['movie', 'worst', 'True', 'Crime', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'think', 'more', 'anything', 'very', 'disturbing', 'probably', 'factual', 'movie', 'Frankly', 'had', 'finally', 'stop', 'watching', 'third', 'way', 'Even', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'how', 'monstrous', 'police', 'interrogators', 'were', 'am', 'absolutely', 'sure', 'probably', 'were', 'worse', 'got', 'point', 'early', 'whole', 'family', 'was', 'being', 'harassed', 'especially', 'Michael', 'Maybe', 'enjoy', 'more', 'positive', 'light', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'SO', 'much', 'demonstration', 'how', 'awful', 'police', 'were', 'can', 'be', 'really', 'did', 'get', 'point', 'early', 'are', 'police', 'investigators', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'seek', 'truth', 'seek', 'early', 'completion', 'investigation', 'can', 'file', 'report', 'go', 'home', 'dinner', 'Swift', 'justice', 'not', 'always', 'equal', 'true', 'justice', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'depicted', 'police', 'harrassment', 'lesser', 'point', 'then', 'showed', 'eventual', 'true', 'justice', 'came', 'family', 'victim', 'movie', 'became', 'too', 'boring', 'continue', 'watch', 'may', 'try', 'again', 'fast', 'forward', 'evil', 'cop', 'scenes', 'watch', 'vindication', 'Michael', 'heart', 'go', 'out', 'family', 'though', 'only', 'are', 'police', 'who', 'let', 'power', 'get', 'most']",The Interrogation of Michael Crowe

As the family struggled to dissect the painful evidence of their daughter's death, the police pinpoint their prime suspect - her brother, Michael. Every tactic at the police's disposal is used to manipulate and bully Michael into confessing to the gruesome crime. But, is he truly responsible for her vicious death? The Interrogation of Michael Crowe stars Ally SheedyAn original movie for Court TV, THE INTERROGATION OF MICHAEL CROWE is based on the horrifyingly true story of the Californian Crowe family's double-victimization. When 12-year-old Stephanie is stabbed in her sleep, the police working on the investigation turn to the closest suspect: her 14-year-old brother, Michael. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the policemen are doing whatever they can to cajole a confession from the boy, convinced of his guilt by such peripheral evidence as his interest in Dungeons & Dragons.
