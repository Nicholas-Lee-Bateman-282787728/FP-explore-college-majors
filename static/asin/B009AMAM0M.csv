Innuendos and big chickens that explains where car hybrids come from. They threw in an asthmatic cat is a good addition to the mix.I've seen better versions of this genre. However this is well done.

1592402,A24PMZJF0LHGCW,B009AMAM0M,Gilby Mitnick III Jr.,"[7, 14]","I think Fun Size was one of the most highly original and super-smart movies that I have ever seen not just this year, but in the past 20 years...easily! While you will be forgiven for misjudging Fun Size as being just another derivative teen comedy--it has a cast of young people, Victoria Justice (did I mention she turned 18 nearly two years ago???!) and the guy from The O.C. and Gossip Girls directing--it is so much more profound than that. It is so profound that it handily makes the previous standard bearer for the most highly sophisticated teen comedy, Porky's, look like an absolute piece of s--- by comparison!The undoubted strength of Fun Size comes from its exceptionally innovative and revolutionary plot that, at least to my mind, has never, ever been tried before in a movie in this genre--or any genre!! It stars Victoria Justice (she turned 18 about two years ago, by the way) of that unchallenging Victorious TV show as Wren, a girl who is delighted to find out that she's been invited to a Halloween sex party by her wannabe eff buddy, Aaron. Throwing a massive monkey wrench into this otherwise innocent and family friendly plotline is the insistence of her mom (played by that very funny comedienne called Chelsea Handler who, by comparison, makes Paula Poundstone look like the funniest woman on Earth) that she take along her little brother named Albert. The running gag in this highly tasteful movie is that Albert is a r/e/t/a/r/d who ""suffers"" from autism, which was such a hilarious hook that I was hardly able to contain my laughter at the punch line of the r/e/t/a/r/d/e/d kid!! Of course, a part of me shuddered at this small hint of insensitivity toward the larger r/e/t/a/r/d community in the world, because I have decent morals, after all, yet I soon discovered that the director of this movie wanted r/e/t/a/r/d/s to be the b/u/t/t of his unambitious movie so I laughed along merrily.As the movie goes on, Albert the autistic kid eventually gets lost on Halloween...while wearing a Barack Obama mask...in South Central LA! I know! Even more hilarious hilarity ensues, pardner! The rest of the movie somewhat cruelly continues to make fun of Albert's r/e/t/a/r/d/e/d autism tendencies, which includes awkward scenes involving his inability to talk to other people smoothly, his penchant for wetting his pants, and his being possessed by several demons at a time. Wren and her crush, Aaron, eventually steal a car and engage in misadventures that are not at all clich&eacute;d or directly stolen from 80s teen movies.On the whole, I think Fun Size is definitely worth your precious time and money, but you will require a lot of patience in order to sit through its excessive helpings of originality, awesomeness and sophisticated intelligence. At first, I thought that making fun of Victoria Justice's r/e/t/a/r/d/e/d kid brother was a little bit close to not that nice, yet I quickly decided that making fun of mentally deficient folks was a surefire and very classy way to get laughs!

Surprisingly, the efforts didn't completely fail.Wren (Victoria Justice) is a pretty, popular senior in High School, and she's about to attend the party of the year where the BMOC will profess his love to her through horrible, faux-sensitive Indy music.  Her trampy mother Joy (Chelsea Handler - casted perfectly), who has her own party to attend, screws everything up when she forgoes the responsibilities of adulthood and forces Wren to act as a mother-figure to her own chubby, trouble-making, potentially mute, probable future serial-killer brother, Albert.  Stuck babysitting her brother, Wren loses track of the pint-sized criminal and then links up with her best friend, a guy playing the quintessential nerdy crush, and a fourth wheel to find the little hell-raiser.  Somewhere in there is Johnny Knoxville as the bad guy, some fowl-automobile love, and the eventual end of script realizations.Most of the contents are recycled and disposable, but it's still somewhat entertaining.  It's far better than many other movies I've seen.  The connection to Nickelodeon hurt, but it's far edgier - crude jokes, current slang, pop culture references - than expected.  That unfortunate dichotomy is what ties this movie's hands.  It doesn't placate either the young, impressionable minds or the old, perverted minds.  It stays in a purgatory between Hannah Montana andJonah Hill, and never really connects with either audience.The feeling I get from this movie reminds me of trick-or-treating as a kid, going to a door, seeing someone graciously drop candy into my bag, and then realizing it's that nasty candy corn.  It's nice to get candy, but I could live without it.  As an easily distracted grown man with a juvenile sense of humor, I admit to being close to the target audience.  And even I can't give this movie more than 3 stars.",3,"Oooh, Halloween candy!

1592428,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B009AMAM0M,Paul Allaer,"[3, 6]","""Fun Size"" (2012 release; 90 min.) is a PG-13 rated Nickelodeon movie which brings the story of Wren (played by Nickelodeon TV star Victoria Justice) who lives in suburban Cleveland and is getting ready for what she hopes will be a great party at the house of Aaron, on whom she has a secret crush. A problem arises when Wren's mom (played by stand-up comedian Chelsea Handler) informs her that she is going out herself, and as a result Wren is tasked with watching over her 8 yr. brother Albert. Wren and her best friend April go out for a walk on Halloween, along with little Albert. Soon enough, though, they lose track of Albert and they now need to do whatever they can do to find Albert before Wren's mom comes back home. Wren and April sweet-talk two guys, Roosevelt and Peng, to give them a ride to look for Albert. I will leave it at that, as to give more away from the plot would ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: fist and foremost, this is a sweet little movie that strikes a great balance between pranks and teenage romance. Second, even though Victoria Justice is well known for her roles on Nickelodeon TV, this is her first headlining role in a major movie, and she is utterly charming. Third, the movie is set in Cleveland, and the producers really make it look very nice, with panoramic shots of downtown but also the Lakewood and Cleveland Heights neighborhoods. Fourth, I thought that Chelsea Handler was badly miscast as Wren's mom, for one thing she looks more like she could be Wren's sister, not her mom. Fifth, there is also a decent enough soundtrack, featuring songs from Passion Pitt, the Magic Wand and others.Last but not least, the movie is rated PG-13 for a reason. At the movie showing I attended today, incredibly there were several parents who came to see this with kids who had to be 5-6 yrs. old AT MOST. To no-one's surpise, these little kids were utterly bored by this movie and became restless not even 10 min. into it. Wow, just wow.

1592440,AP3B615GM191G,B009AMAM0M,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[11, 22]","Every once in awhile, I'm up for a good hijinks movie.  So, I decided to take my younger sister (who usually eats up anything Disney/Nick) to see this one the weekend before Halloween.  I knew from the first 10-15 minutes that this was going to be mind-numbingly stupid, and even my sister agreed upon the film's conclusion that it just wasn't very good at all.For a basic plot summary, ""Fun Size"" sees teenage Wren (Victoria Justice) and her crazier friend April (Jane Levy) forced to babysit her younger brother Albert (Jackson Nicoll) on Halloween night instead of going to the ""cool kids"" party.  When Albert goes missing, however, craziness ensues.There are two main problems with this movie:1. It has been absolutely done to death over the past few years (or since whenever ""Superbad"" came out).  The whole ""group of friends doing crazy things and getting involved in wacky situations"" genre was copied and pasted time and time again after ""Superbad"", and now maybe has just gotten a bit stale.2. The main problem, though, is that such ""hijinks flicks"", as I like to call them, are usually made for a more mature audience.  In the case of ""Fun Size"", though, the jokes are not ""crude"" enough for the older teens but a bit too ""crude"" for the younger teens.  It is kind of like the film is stuck in limbo between potential audiences.I wish I could find anything good to say about this effort, but I really cannot.  The acting is nothing special, the plot has no place in these kind of movies, and the overall message is so sappy that it is just too unrealistic to take seriously whatsoever.Thus, ""Fun Size"" can be avoided at all costs with no regret.  Frankly put, it just doesn't have any one audience that will feel comfortable watching it.",1,Wrong Type Of Audience For This Type of Movie,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,1747,"['once', 'awhile', ""'m"", 'up', 'good', 'hijinks', 'movie', 'So', 'decided', 'take', 'younger', 'sister', 'who', 'usually', 'up', 'anything', 'Disney/Nick', 'see', 'one', 'weekend', 'Halloween', 'knew', 'first', '10-15', 'minutes', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'mind-numbingly', 'stupid', 'even', 'sister', 'agreed', 'film', 'conclusion', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Fun', 'Size', 'teenage', 'Wren', 'Victoria', 'Justice', 'crazier', 'friend', 'April', 'Jane', 'Levy', 'forced', 'babysit', 'younger', 'brother', 'Albert', 'Jackson', 'Nicoll', 'Halloween', 'night', 'instead', 'going', 'cool', 'kids', 'party', 'When', 'Albert', 'missing', 'however', 'craziness', 'are', 'two', 'main', 'problems', 'movie:1', 'been', 'absolutely', 'done', 'death', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'whenever', 'Superbad', 'came', 'out', 'whole', 'group', 'friends', 'doing', 'crazy', 'things', 'getting', 'involved', 'wacky', 'situations', 'genre', 'was', 'copied', 'pasted', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'Superbad', 'now', 'maybe', 'just', 'gotten', 'bit', 'stale.2', 'main', 'problem', 'though', 'such', 'hijinks', 'flicks', 'like', 'call', 'are', 'usually', 'made', 'more', 'mature', 'audience', 'case', 'Fun', 'Size', 'though', 'jokes', 'are', 'not', 'crude', 'enough', 'older', 'teens', 'bit', 'too', 'crude', 'younger', 'teens', 'kind', 'film', 'stuck', 'limbo', 'potential', 'audiences.I', 'wish', 'could', 'find', 'anything', 'good', 'say', 'effort', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'acting', 'nothing', 'special', 'plot', 'place', 'kind', 'movies', 'overall', 'message', 'so', 'sappy', 'just', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'take', 'seriously', 'whatsoever.Thus', 'Fun', 'Size', 'can', 'be', 'avoided', 'costs', 'regret', 'Frankly', 'put', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'audience', 'will', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'watching']",Fun Size
