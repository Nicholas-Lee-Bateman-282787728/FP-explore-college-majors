284514,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6301973364,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","Biographical movies have always been popular, but seldom has such an unexpected individual been portrayed on the screen, especially under the Hollywood production code.  Emile Zola (1840-1902) was a highly controversial novelist who was variously praised and damned for his ultra-realistic depictions of highly sordid material.  In 1898 Zola became involved in the infamous ""Dreyfus Affair,"" in which the French military's ingrained anti-Semitism motivated the false conviction of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, who was court-martialed for treason and sentenced to life at Devil's Island.  Zola's very public support of Dreyfus and accusations of military corruption led to his own trail for criminal libel.  Convicted, Zola escaped to England and continued in his support of Dreyfus, who was eventually pardoned, and his attacks on the French military and government, which fell in 1898.  Zola died under somewhat questionable circumstances in 1902, and many thought he had been assassinated.  Dreyfus was ultimately exonerated in 1906.It is was, to say the very least, a very complicated life, and the scandal of the Dreyfus Affair was still well recalled by many when the 1937 THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA hit movie screens.  As with many biographical films, the movie plays fast and loose with the facts.  By way of passing example, the film shows Zola's first major success as the novel NANA, when in fact it was the earlier THERESE RAQUIN.  But most interesting is the way in which the film treats the issue of anti-Semitism.  It doesn't mention it at all.  Dreyfus is never described as Jewish and his attackers are never specifically identified as anti-Semitic.  This seems to be have been a deliberate choice by Warner Brothers, which feared a German backlash against the film.  Even so, the film is often regarded as an early example of Hollywood's negative stance against Nazi Germany in terms of tone.The central charm of THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA is the performance of Paul Muni in the title role.  Trained on the stage, Muni tended to give unexpectedly broad performances that actually worked on film, and he was noted for his elaborate preparation and make-up.  He is truly spectacular here, with the trial sequence one of the highlights of his career.  Also notable is Gale Sondergaard in the role of Dreyfus' wife, who presses Zola into taking an interest in the case.  The film is unexpectedly powerful, especially in its crowd scenes; it is hard to imagine a modern film duplicating these, and director William Dieterle endows the movie with a sense of speed and swirl of action that remains memorable to this day.  There are times when the movie seems a bit slow---especially in the first half---and our notions about movies have changed a good deal over the years, so some views may find it a little uphill.  Worth the effort nonetheless.  The DVD has a few minor bonuses, including a Lux Radio Theatre version.

It's a memorable acting job. Equally  memorable is Joseph Schildkraut as Captain Dreyfus, an army man that Zola  defended against charges of treason.

If you do not know French history this may not help you much concerning Zola and where he stands. Those associated with the film shared Zola's radical/socialist views (which are never even discussed in the film). France was, during Zola's life, swinging between Monarchy, Empire, Republicanism and socialism (which was vying for control - then and now). Zola always was concerned with what he perceived with injustice - he was often right.In any case the film disposes of much of his early and mid-life and then concentrates on his taking on the Dreyfus case.

284522,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6301973364,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[48, 51]","Freedom is often taken for granted in our technologically advancing society, as a political and social complacency seems to have been generated through an overwhelming level of obligation to professional careers and other domestic responsibilities.  People are also literally crushed by an ever-growing media tsunami through cable TV, abundance of Internet news sites, and newspapers.  In this depth of information the individual simply drowns, as vital information is often smudged with star-studded gossip in the non-stop news tickers.  Mass information could therefore function as a form of misinformation when essential information tries to reach the light of public attention.  Some of this information could be in regards to decisions politicians and other authority figures make, which could affect the rights of the people.  Thus, it has become essential for people to learn how to filter information.  However, in the days of Emile Zola information was usually from one, or a few sources, which often proclaimed that the information was the ""truth"", as it was seldom challenged, until Zola.In the Life of Emile Zola the audience gets to experience a somewhat fictionalized story of Zola (Paul Muni).  Emile Zola, a novelist and critic, frequently struggled to make a living before he wrote the successful novel Nana, which dealt with prostitution.  Throughout his career he wrote several masterpieces such as Germinal and the Downfall.  Each of Zola's literary contributions was heavily influenced by the social struggle of the French people, which was highly criticized by authorities.  Some of his novels where even banned due to their controversial issues as they were released at the end of the 19th century.  Nevertheless, Zola persevered and continued to write novels depicting the social and political truth of French society, which he loved and adored.Throughout the years Zola gained weight and wealth, as he ironically became one of the people who he frequently described with contempt in his novels.  This was the result of the acquired wealth, which gave Zola an opportunity to live a life of leisure and delight.  In his blissfulness he forgot the world around him, as he drifted into a complacent mind frame.  His old friend the painter Paul Cezanne (Vladimir Sokoloff) criticized his neglectful attitude towards the French society, as he promised not to write when has moved south.  During this period when Zola was more occupied with finding a fresh lobster at the local market there was a legendary military trial in regards to an officer named Alfred Dreyfus (Joseph Schildkraut) who appeared to the society to have committed the shameful act of treason.The truth was unknown to the world, as generals and other high-ranking officers had decided that Dreyfus was guilty due to his ethnicity.  It was an anti-Semitic approach that led this innocent man into suffering years of imprisonment on the Devil's Island of the South American coast.  Dreyfus' wife insisted on her husband's innocence, as she finally approached Zola for his help when she had documents proving Dreyfus' innocence.  Initially Zola leaned on his complacency, but a quick reminder from a glimpse of his friend Cezanne led him to take on the French Army and the biased court system of France.  Unfortunately, it lead Zola to escape imprisonment by traveling across the English Channel and make London his temporary home while continuing to write about the unjust French legal system and the French military's error.William Dieterle directs a masterful story in Life of Emile Zola, which grabs the audience with an inspiring affect that stirs an internal motivation to help the fight against injustice in a cerebral and peaceful manner.  In addition, the film has a strong historical perspective as the film was released a couple of years before World War II and during a period when several million Jews were persecuted in Nazi-Germany.

284525,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,6301973364,Martin Asiner,"[25, 25]","In 1936, Paul Muni was on a roll.  He had just won an Oscar for best actor in THE STORY OF LOUIS PASTEUR, so it was no surprise that a year later, director William Dieterle chose him for the lead in THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA.  Zola, as Muni plays him, is a man who brings to mind a stuffy but morally centered grandfather type who sees his mission in life as the only man who is willing to stand up for what is right and root out corruption and evil when all others turn away claiming one valid excuse after another.TLEZ is your standard but exceptional Hollywood bio-movie then so popular.  Typically, such films begin 'en medias res', thrusting the hero into a series of lesser adventures that prefigure his later, more heroic ones. Zola and Paul Cezanne (Vladimir Sokoloff) are two poverty-stricken friends sharing a dumpy apartment in Paris.  Each dreams of using his talent, Cezanne with art, Zola with words, to shake a complacent world with the immediacy of their need to force others to re-evaluate some given bedrock assumptions.  Zola is a mudracker, but he cannot find it in himself to lead the fight alone.  At critical points in the movie, others step in and out of his life to fire his conscience.  Zola and Cezanne meet a streetwalker, Nana, who pours out a tale of economically blighted woe, the result of which is to fire Zola's imagination to write a novel exposing the corruption of a society that allowed such otherwise decent women to go astray.  The first half of the movie sets up the character of Zola as one who, when convinced of the rightness of his cause, would boldly put in print inflammatory words that more than once would place him in peril. The second half focuses on the relation that Zola had with Alfred Dreyfus, a French Jew who was a captain in the French army.  Zola and Dreyfus never met, but their interaction set the stage for some political fireworks that rocked the very core of the French government. Dreyfus was wrongfully accused of spying for the Germans, and a kangaroo court-martial found him guilty of treason and sent him to Devil's Island as punishment.  In historical truth, Dreyfus's Jewishness was a significant factor in arousing France's widespread anti-Semitism against him.  Director Dieterle sidesteps this controversy by using the word 'Jew' only once, and then briefly in a personal file on Dreyfus. At first, Zola does not care very much for Dreyfus' protestations of innocence.  However, when the wife of Dreyfus makes a personal appeal to him for help, he agrees and the movie then turns into a battle between Zola and a corrupt, entrenched French High Command who are collectively willing to see Dreyfus rot on Devil's Island to save their own skins.  Zola's 'I Accuse' harangue rings with the sincerity of a man who is willing to take on the Powers That Be to save a country's honor when those very corrupt Powers argue that their own sense of honor requires the opposite.  Louis Calhern leads a fine supporting cast as one of the lying officers who see honor only in lying to the French public about their own shortcomings. Joseph Schildkraut as the accused Dreyfus brings considerable dignity to the role of a man who is forced to endure a public and humiliating ritual of dishonoring.  By the film's end, the audience can see that virtue and honesty are not enough to ensure the ongoing vitality of a country's nobility.  For that, the occasional pecking gadfly is needed.  Zola was such a gadfly.  THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA serves to remind us that such gadflies are often in short supply, especially when they are most needed.",5,The Life of Emile Zola: Stuffy but Stately,1030665600,"08 30, 2002",2002,3594,"['1936', 'Paul', 'Muni', 'was', 'roll', 'had', 'just', 'won', 'Oscar', 'best', 'actor', 'THE', 'STORY', 'OF', 'LOUIS', 'PASTEUR', 'was', 'surprise', 'year', 'later', 'director', 'William', 'Dieterle', 'chose', 'lead', 'THE', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'EMILE', 'ZOLA', 'Zola', 'Muni', 'man', 'who', 'mind', 'stuffy', 'morally', 'centered', 'type', 'who', 'mission', 'life', 'only', 'man', 'who', 'willing', 'stand', 'up', 'what', 'right', 'out', 'corruption', 'evil', 'when', 'others', 'turn', 'away', 'claiming', 'one', 'valid', 'excuse', 'another.TLEZ', 'standard', 'exceptional', 'Hollywood', 'bio-movie', 'then', 'so', 'popular', 'Typically', 'such', 'films', 'begin', ""'en"", 'medias', 'res', 'thrusting', 'hero', 'series', 'lesser', 'adventures', 'prefigure', 'later', 'more', 'heroic', 'ones', 'Zola', 'Paul', 'Cezanne', 'Vladimir', 'Sokoloff', 'are', 'two', 'poverty-stricken', 'friends', 'sharing', 'dumpy', 'apartment', 'Paris', 'dreams', 'using', 'talent', 'Cezanne', 'art', 'Zola', 'words', 'shake', 'complacent', 'world', 'immediacy', 'need', 'force', 'others', 're-evaluate', 'given', 'bedrock', 'assumptions', 'Zola', 'mudracker', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'lead', 'fight', 'alone', 'critical', 'points', 'movie', 'others', 'step', 'life', 'fire', 'conscience', 'Zola', 'Cezanne', 'meet', 'streetwalker', 'Nana', 'who', 'out', 'tale', 'economically', 'blighted', 'woe', 'result', 'fire', 'Zola', 'imagination', 'write', 'novel', 'exposing', 'corruption', 'society', 'allowed', 'such', 'otherwise', 'decent', 'women', 'go', 'astray', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'up', 'character', 'Zola', 'one', 'who', 'when', 'convinced', 'rightness', 'cause', 'would', 'boldly', 'put', 'print', 'inflammatory', 'words', 'more', 'once', 'would', 'place', 'peril', 'second', 'half', 'relation', 'Zola', 'had', 'Alfred', 'Dreyfus', 'French', 'Jew', 'who', 'was', 'captain', 'French', 'army', 'Zola', 'Dreyfus', 'never', 'met', 'interaction', 'set', 'stage', 'political', 'fireworks', 'rocked', 'very', 'core', 'French', 'government', 'Dreyfus', 'was', 'wrongfully', 'accused', 'spying', 'Germans', 'kangaroo', 'court-martial', 'found', 'guilty', 'treason', 'sent', 'Devil', 'Island', 'punishment', 'historical', 'truth', 'Dreyfus', 'Jewishness', 'was', 'significant', 'factor', 'arousing', 'France', 'widespread', 'anti-Semitism', 'Director', 'Dieterle', 'controversy', 'using', 'word', 'only', 'once', 'then', 'briefly', 'personal', 'file', 'Dreyfus', 'first', 'Zola', 'not', 'care', 'very', 'much', 'Dreyfus', 'protestations', 'innocence', 'However', 'when', 'wife', 'Dreyfus', 'personal', 'appeal', 'help', 'movie', 'then', 'battle', 'Zola', 'corrupt', 'entrenched', 'French', 'High', 'Command', 'who', 'are', 'collectively', 'willing', 'see', 'Dreyfus', 'rot', 'Devil', 'Island', 'save', 'own', 'skins', 'Zola', 'Accuse', 'harangue', 'rings', 'sincerity', 'man', 'who', 'willing', 'take', 'Powers', 'Be', 'save', 'country', 'honor', 'when', 'very', 'corrupt', 'Powers', 'argue', 'own', 'sense', 'honor', 'opposite', 'Louis', 'Calhern', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'one', 'lying', 'officers', 'who', 'see', 'honor', 'only', 'lying', 'French', 'public', 'own', 'shortcomings', 'Joseph', 'Schildkraut', 'accused', 'Dreyfus', 'considerable', 'dignity', 'role', 'man', 'who', 'forced', 'endure', 'public', 'humiliating', 'ritual', 'dishonoring', 'film', 'end', 'audience', 'can', 'see', 'virtue', 'honesty', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'ensure', 'ongoing', 'vitality', 'country', 'nobility', 'occasional', 'pecking', 'gadfly', 'needed', 'Zola', 'was', 'such', 'gadfly', 'LIFE', 'OF', 'EMILE', 'ZOLA', 'remind', 'such', 'gadflies', 'are', 'often', 'short', 'supply', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'most', 'needed']",N/A

This is perhaps the most legitimate and faithful - certainly, the most serious and stirring - biographical film to emerge from a major Hollywood studio, and so quite unlike anything that had ever been seen on the screen until that time. Warner spared no expense in retelling Zola's early and lingering success as an author and tragic death in a house fire. Embarking in idyllic 1862's Paris with Zola's initial fame, the film delves compassionately into the morbid curiosity and imfamous trial known as the Dreyfus Affair. Encouraged by confidant and contemporary, painter Paul Cezanne (Vladamir Sokoloff) to dispell his own comfortable success and, to stand up for truth and justice, Zola decides to take on the case of Capt. Alfred Dreyfus (Joseph Schildkraut), a war hero unjustly accused of disclosing military secrets and imprisoned on Devil's Island.There are so many powerful and haunting moments in this bio that it's hard to pinpoint exactly where its greatness derives. But it is perhaps best exemplified by the dynamic interactions between Zola and Cezanne. These lead into the beautfully realized and justly celebrated court room summation that, once seen, is not to be forgotten.""There are times when the most courageous thing is to be cowardly"" exclaims Zola...indeed. The quiet rectitude of ""The Life of Emile Zola"" is a distinct pleasure for classic cinema fans - neither embellished or flag waving, but just as emotionally satisfying and twice as likely to be championed well into the next century. The film's definite slant toward critiquing anti-Semitism is now a time capsule; forshadowing the growing angst of nations and Nazi terror that was to engulf Europe and cast the world into its second great war. However, William Dieterle's direction is timeless, with slick panache that makes all his points but never heavy-handed or without style befitting a classic biography. The score, by luminary composer Max Steiner, is striking and poignant. In short, ""The Life of Emile Zola"" is befitting of the Oscar for Best Picture and very much a relic from Hollywood's golden age worthy of considerable and repeated re-examination.Warner Home Video's DVD is a reason to stand up and cheer. While there are age related artifacts present throughout, and some scenes suffer from considerable grain, the overall image quality is solid, sharp and beautifully contrasted. The gray scale has been impeccably rendered with deep, rich blacks and, for the most part, solid clean whites. Certain brief sections appear to have been duped in from second or third generation elements, but, keeping in mind that the film is 70 plus year old, such lapses should easily be forgiven. The audio is mono but has been presented at an adequate listening level. A slight hiss is detected occasionally. Save a complete and costly digital restoration, no more could have been expected by the good people at Warners on this transfer. It is head and shoulders above anything the film has looked like in years. Extras include a rare audio only recording of Muni doing Zola on radio, a dramatic, and, a cartoon short subject. The one disappointment here is that no time was taken to do a featurette on the making of this classic film.

In less than two years (1939) Germany and France would be at war against each other.  Thus, it is surprising that this movie seems intent upon not annoying Hitler or the widespread anti-Jewish sentiments in this country.The star and Academy Award winner of ...Zola (Muni) was Jewish.  And anyone remotely aware of the Dreyfus Affair knows that Dreyfus was a Jew.  In fact, the reason he was accused and convicted of treason was primarily because of his being Jewish.  Anti-Jewish epithets were hurled at him from start to finish.  And yet this film does not even hint that anti-Semitism had anything to do with his conviction and sentencing to Devil's Island, the hell-hole of the world in French Guiana on the coast of South America.  I can only guess why this is so, and none of my conjectures are complimentary to Warner Brothers.But despite this, ...Zola is a far better than average movie.  It is a bit slow to get going, but once it gets to the Dreyfus Affair, the film is gripping, especially the long courtroom scene.

Paul Muni, the great Polish actor who specialized in playing great men of history (seemingly taking the place of the elderly English stage-trained George Arliss) is terrific in his characterization of Emile Zola. It took Warners nearly a year to prepare the &quot;Zola project&quot;. The screenplay went through various re-writes and a great deal of research was done to ensure historical accuracy; the result was a showcase for the unique Mr.Muni. The picture may seem a trifle dry, stodgy and drawn-out today, but it has long been esteemed as one of the greatest historical biographies Hollywood ever put on film. Variety called it &quot;a vibrant, tense and emotional story about the man who fought a nation with his pen&quot; It has followed not merely the spirit but, to a rare degree, the very letter of his life and of the historically significant lives around him. The racial theme involving the Jewish Dreyfus is tastefully handled; not once is the word &quot;Jew&quot; mentioned. The movie brought not only great financial success to Warner Bros., but prestige as well.

Paul Muni portrays Zola most realistically, from his rise from the cramped, cold  apartment of his early career to becoming the literary toast of France.  And just when it seems that life is as good as it can be, along comes the  &quot;Dreyfus Affair&quot; to challenge his conscience.  All he has to do  is keep quiet, and he can live a life of luxury right to the end.  However,  &quot;all&quot; becomes too much for the man who has spent his life  developing the social conscience of his country through literature.  Muni  is brilliant in the role of Zola, and all the supporting cast give  believable and stirring performances.  This film holds you in its grip  from start to finish, as it examines the worth of social institutions  versus the lives of the people who uphold and venerate them, and sometimes  become their victims.

Muni is great value as Zola, much like the offscreen young Chaplin in the early scenes before becoming the great man of letters, where he walks the tightrope between over and underplaying, and he's given two great setpiece speeches - J'accuse and his address to the court - that are foolproof crowdpleasers that he handles with relish and aplomb. It's like one of Warners' crusading social issue pictures that just happens to have been set in the late 19th century and shot on an epic scale, and it has an immediacy and sense of moral outrage that is surprisingly powerful and deeply felt and even, ultimately, quite moving.
