1537186,A22JR9ROYRPN7P,B007RMQ4HC,ANAN KHALIQUE,"[11, 17]","It;s about time a Taker set gets a blu ray release. Hopefully it will get the blu ray treatment the other WWE sets have gotten and have exclusive content.WM7 - This is where it all began. In a complete squash, Taker defeated HOFer, Jimmy Snuka in a short amount of time. I believed he should have had a Title shot after this. Looking back, if he did, his reign would have lasted longer than 6 days.WM8 - In another squash, Taker defeated Jake Roberts after sitting up from two DDT's. And in those days, the DDT was not a regular move people always kick out of.WM9 - The worst match in WM history. Even Taker admitted that. His entrance was a spectacle. But that doesn't surprise me because they always are. This is the only match in the history of The Streak where Taker won via DQ. They had options for better opponents too because anyone would have served as a better opponent than the ultra limited Gonzalez. My pick would be either newcomer, Razor Ramon or due to similarites between them, Papa Shango. I know Shango was a Voodoo guy while Taker wasn't. But they still possessed some kind of mystical or supernatural, otherworldly stuff and were both mysterios in their own way so the similarities were there.WM11 - Here, Taker defeats Bundy. Definitely not Taker's best WM match. A more suitable opponent from the Million $ Corporation would be either Bam Bam or Tatanka.WM12 - Here, Taker faces Diesel in a decent match. Men the size of Diesel usually lack mobility and coordination and are therefore limited in the ring. Not the case for these two though. I enjoyed this match.WM13 - Here, we get the opposite of what we got at WM12. I remember this for Taker's entrance, Title win and post-match celebration. I think everyone else does too.WM14 - In his My Yard documentary, Taker states this is one of his favorite matches and describes this properly as ""an all out physical war."" If The Streak was to end, I feel this would've been the perfect time for it because Kane was coming in with such strong momentum that a win would have just added to that. Plus, he's the only guy at WM to kick out of two Tombstone's in a row.WM15 - The worst HIAC. So bad, it was not on WWE's HIAC compilation dvd. However, the aftermath is a different story. Boss Man was hung from the Cell. I felt that even in the Attitude Era where they pushed things beyond the envelope that this was just taking it a bit too far. Just my opinion.WM17 - GREAT match! This was not advertised as a No Holds Barred match. But ultimately, it turned out to be just that with the referee knocked out throughout most of the bout.WM18 - Though I am not a fan of Ric Flair's in ring style, I commend Flair's performance here considering his age. Great showing by him & Taker. One of the things that will probably not be featured on this set unless it's an extra which I doubt, I can't find the words to express how I felt when the female fan cried when meeting Taker, her favorite wrestler.WM19 - Had Taker & Big Show met at WM in 1999, it would have turned out better since Taker was feuding with The Corporation at the time. This handicap match which was originally supposed to be a tag match was quickly thrown together it seemed like so Taker could have a WM match. I know Taker was feuding with Show at this time. But it should have ended at No Way Out where Taker defeated him.WM20 - I cannot really term this a match even though it actually was. A more accurate term for this IMO would be Taker's revenge. It was less than 10 minute match that did what it needed to do - allow Taker to gain revenge on the man who buried him alive thus ending the ABA/Big Evil persona at Survivor Series 2003, Kane. Taker's entrance was spectacular. It was awesome hearing fans chanting Taker while he walked up the steps and raised the lights as that just added to this already awesome entrance.WM21 - A lot of people feel this is where The Streak should have ended if it was meant to. I don't know about that. But what I do know is that the young Orton really shined here. These two really jelled well together.WM22 - The first and so far only Casket match at WM. Too bad Mark Henry was the opponent. He might be better now. But at the time, he was not. It was an impressive feat though to see Taker Tombstone Henry. That, the dive, the win, and the celebration were the highlights for me as well as the entrance.WM23 - Tremendous match. This should have closed the show. Taker really brought new life into Batista here. Taker wins his 5th World Title here.WM24 - This is the currently the last WM to date to feature The Druids as they were not present for the next four WM's. I can see why this is Edge's favorite WM moment. Cole described this perfectly as a counter-filled match. Taker wins his 6th World Title here. But unlike all the other previous WM's (except for 9 & 11), Taker does not win with The Tombstone. He wins with Hell's Gate.WM25 - The 30 minute epic that saved this WM. It will be great to see this on blu ray as this match deserves to be seen in that quality. Words cannot do this match justice.WM26 - Not as good as WM25. But still great. This is HBK's last match. The aftermath, if you have seen it, watch it. It is priceless.WM27 - Taker was really dominated here. He won. But did not walk out. A lot of people thought this would be his last match. But this was obviously done to set up his match at WM28 with HHH.WM28 - The best HIAC match to date since KOTR 98 in my opinion. That says a lot because there have been some great ones such as Taker vs Edge, Taker vs Batista, Taker vs Orton, Cactus Jack/Mick Foley vs HHH and the 6 man HIAC at Armageddon in 2000 to name just a few. Of course, the first HIAC is a classic match as well. This was a more evenly bout compared to WM27. HBK served as guest referee. Many thought he'd screw someone. The majority thought he'd try to work with HHH to screw Taker to get back at him for WM26. It was even brought up by Michael Cole that HHH won every match that he was in that HBK referred. It was not mentioned though that HBK referred Taker's SSlam97 WWF Title match with Bret and ended up costing Taker to lose the Title. As great as the match was, the aftermath is a priceless, epic moment that needs to be seen because words cannot do it any justice. By the way, Taker was sporting a mohawk that I found to be awesome. This was explianed by Lawler who said Taker was driven so crazy that he kept cutting his hair till HHH accepted the rematch. Taker also had a wicked looking spiked up jacket too!What I want this to feature:1. Interviews/comments from his opponents.2. A documentary that has all new comments as in nothing about The Streak from other sets is on here. WWE have a habit of reusing things, Taker's Top 50 Stars profile had comments that were on The Greatest Stars Of The 90's set. I don't wanna see anything reused or recycled for The Streak. I also hope the documentary is the usual length WWE has for their DVD's. Hey, they're talking about a 20-0 record so they could make this the longest documentary to date they ever put out if they wanted to.Extras:Taker's face turn - This was on SNME where Taker saved Elizabeth and Savage from an attack by Jake RobertsFuneral Parlour segment - This is where Jake locked Taker's hand in the casket and repeatedly hit him with chair shots.Taker dragging Diesel down into the depths - This was at IYH: Rage In A Cage where Taker cost Diesel the match with Bret Hart.Taker returns to RAW - This was in March of 98. Taker made an awesome return and accepted Kane's WM challenge.Taker's message to Kane - This is where Taker stood on top of the Titantron and told Kane, ""WM14, I will strike with great vengeance and fury as anger."", ""You will know my name as the Lord Of Darkness."", ""The only thing you can do now is R.I.P."" before burning an enfigy (Sorry for the wrong spelling) of Kane via a bolt of lighting.Taker interrupts HHH - This is where Taker told HHH that he didn't like him. respect him or fear him and that he's never beaten him after HHH said he's beaten everyone there is to beat.Taker wants HHH - This is here Taker instructs Kane to go after Stephanie and then asks Regal for a match with HHH at WM.Taker busted open - This is where HHH nails a handcuffed Taker with a sledgehammer busting him open leaving a scar that can still be seen to this very day.Taker interview - This happened on RAW before Taker and Kane met Rock & Austin. Taker said that the 16 staples made him hungry and the only thing that will stop it is his fist covered with HHH's blood. This is also on the Tombstone DVD set.Taker comes to get some - This is where Taker tells HHH that he made a phone call to a lawyer, a bail bondsman, and 911 and then attacked HHH before allowing himself to get arrested.Taker bustine open Arn & David to get Ric to accept a match for WM18Taker's return videos leading up to WM20Taker/Orton contract signing for WM21Taker's promo declaring a sacrifice and then hitting Dupree with a Tombstone on the stepsTaker choosing Batista as his WM23 opponentTaker's promo from the graveyard saying at WM, Batista's reign as Champion would R.I.P.Edge's Funeral for The Streak - Taker sat up and got out of the casket and stared back at Vickie, who screamed.Taker/HBK confrontation - This is where Taker told HBK that he's the most dangerous entity in WWEHBK in the graveyard - This is where Taker spoke him the ring but was interrupted by HBK who was in the graveyard talking about Taker's list of WM victims.HBK promo - This is where HBKs first appeared in all white and where Taker popped form under the ring like he did at IYH back in 96.Taker/HBK promos - The first one was where Taker declined HBK's challenge to a rematch saying he had nothing left to prove, but would accept if the match happened that night on RAW which HBK declined to. The second one was after Elimination Chamber where Taker accepted the rematch if HBK put his career on the line. The third one was where Taker said HBK had a dark cloud over him and where HBK asked that their rematch be a No Holds Barred match.Taker & HHH return to RAW (02.21.11)Taker's promos leading up to WM27, including the one where he, HHH and HBK are in the ring togetherTaker returns to RAW (night after Royal Rumble), all the Taker vignettes, Taker's confrontations with HBK & HHH and the one where all three men are in the ring togetherTaker vs HBK (HIAC) - The match that started the Taker/Kane feud.Taker vs HBK (Casket Match, Royal Rumble 98) - This really added more fuel to the fire that was the Taker/Kane feudTaker vs Bret (WWF Title, Royal Rumble 96) - The match that started the Taker/Diesel feud.Taker vs Bret - WWF Title, RAW 96) - The Royal Rumble rematch which Diesel interfered in also.Taker/Kane WM14 hype promo - This is the promo shown on RAW and the WM14 Free For All to hype the match.A Streak highlight video - The last time this was done was when Taker defeated HBK at WM25 to become 17-0. The video was then shown on Smackdown. It was highlights of all of Taker's WM matches accompanied by background music. It's time for an updated highlight video IMO.Some of these could be added to the set as content that is exclusive to blu ray. If some of these are on the set, I can see some being DVD extras while others are blu ray exclusives. However, I hope all of these are on the set in some form or another.",5,THE MOST AMASING STREAK COMES T BLU RAY!,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",2012,11379,"['s', 'time', 'Taker', 'set', 'blu', 'ray',

1537193,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B007RMQ4HC,D.P.,"[10, 11]","This is one of those cases where I can try to describe the Undertaker but words wouldn't do the character for over the last two decades justice but one of the most important factors in his legacy is his undefeated streak at WrestleMania.  That has become so important in WWE that it's just as important (& in some cases, more important) than any other factor going into the show weather it's the celebrities or the championship matches.  After reaching the mark of 20 victories with no defeats, WWE released this anthology of the the complete matches from this streak along with a special 37 minute ""highlight reel"" documentary on his Mania streak complete with comments from his past opponents (Big Show, Jimmy Snuka, Kevin ""Diesel"" Nash, Triple H, Ric Flair, Randy Orton, Mark Henry, Batista, Edge, Shawn Michaels) & other talent who was around during various points of the streak (John Cena, J.J. Dillion, Ted Dibiase, Paul Bearer)Matches Include:I vs. Jimmy Snuka - This match was pretty short with Taker showcasing his dominance with his trademark moves like the flying clothesline & tombstone. Outside of the fact that this was Taker's Mania debut & the beginning of the streak, nothing special past his dominate victory over a legend.WrestleMania VII[Undertaker 15-0]II vs. Jake Roberts - The former allies & now enemies met here with a different twist for Undertaker as he was now a fan favorite during going into this match. Taker was his usual dominate self here as he completely no sold Robert's offense & took the fight to the floor throwing Jake into the ringpost before going back into the ring throwing him into the turnbuckles. Roberts was able to somehow hit Taker with his DDT twice but make the mistake of turning his focus to Paul Bearer which not only ended up cost Roberts the match but his WWE career at that point.WrestleMania VIII[Undertaker 15-0]III vs. Giant Gonzales - This was one of the rare times that Taker had to look up to someone & Gonzales used that to his advantage to dish out punishment in the ring & out on the floor using the steel steps only for Taker only for him to keep getting back up. Taker was eventually able to get some momentum & take Gonzales down to one knee before he resorted to some desperate tactics to make sure in his mind Taker wouldn't get back up...only for Taker to not only return but also knock Gonzales off his feet. This match took place during the period where WWE saw Taker as more of an attraction & kept having him feud against other ""monster"" characters who just weren't good in the ring causing Taker to have to carry the match on his own as was the case with Gonzales here.WrestleMania IX[Undertaker 15-0]IV vs. King Kong Bundy - After Taker was absent for WMX, he returned here feuding with a member of Ted Dibiase's Million $ Corporation in a mission (that would pretty much describe his entire year of 1995) to retrieve back his urn that was stolen from him while it should be noted that American League Baseball umpire Larry Young was the special referee for some unknown reason. In a nutshell, this match was once again another match where Taker pretty much had to carry the weight here as Bundy was very limited in what he could do past certain moves like his Avalanche splash in the corner however this match was the definition of the phrase ""winning the battle but not the war.""WrestleMania XI[Undertaker 15-0]V vs. Diesel - Thought Undertaker's career (specifically during the mid 90's), he had the reputation for being able to bring out the best performance out of bigger men who were very limited in what they could do in the ring & Kevin ""Diesel"" Nash was one of those men here. This was a match that can be described by Vince McMahon as ""these two monsters are clobbering each other."" They used heavy impact power moves while Taker resorted some some moves we hadn't seen from him at that time like a crossbody block. This was a real hard fought victory for the winner.WrestleMania XII[Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]VI No Disqualification Match vs. WWE Champion Sid - A couple of notes here but an injured Shawn Michaels was on commentary, Undertaker wore his original black & gray ""western"" outfit for the first time in years, and Bret Hart (who had lost a WWE Championship cage match against Sid on RAW earlier in the week thanks to Undertaker) came out with comments for everyone before being taken out.  Taker dominated early & even executed his top rope walk we now know as ""old school"" before Sid was able to catch Taker & take the match to the outside using the guardrail & announce table then focused on Taker's back with various moves like the bearhug, camel clutch, and powerslam.  Both men continued to have the same strategy by either grounding each other with chinlocks & nerve holds or executing the big boot or both going outside of the usual gameplan by coming off the top rope.  This wasn't your typical ""big man"" match as both men here told a story while giving it everything they had possible to give at this time resulting in a competitive match.WrestleMania 13VII vs. Kane - The first match between these two & honestly, I feel this has been the best match between these two as it lived up to the hype & at times, seemed like Taker was fighting himself as they matched each other move for move. Definitely a ""Oh My God!"" moment was where Undertaker flew over the top rope into the announce table. After many matches against each other for years afterwards, this still goes down as my favorite one & a match that lived up to the months of hype building up to it.WrestleMania XIV[Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker; Twisted, Disturbed Life Of Kane; Kane: Journey To Hell]VIII Hell In A Cell vs. Big Boss Man - This was the first time that a Hell In A Cell match took place at Mania as it was during this time period that Taker had his own stable called The Ministry & declared war against Mr. McMahon & his corporation causing McMahon to send his enforcer into action. Overall this was a slow paced brawl that saw Boss Man use his signature handcuffs & nightstick to work over Taker causing him to bleed before Taker recovered using a chair & the cell against Boss Man on his way to victory but it should be noted that the aftermath where Boss Man was hung from the top of the cell thanks to the Brood wasn't shown. This match was very disappointing quality for this type of match to the point where they never show highlights of this match when showing the history of the match & this match was excluded from the DVD anthology of Hell In A Cell.WrestleMania XV[Undertaker 15-0]IX vs. Triple H - This was the first major meeting between these two superstars & it got real personal with Triple H busting Taker open requiring a high amount of stitches in his forehead (which you can see up close in the DVD extra interview). This started off wild with the spanish table being broken early before it settled in the ring & Taker got so focused on revenge that he attacked & knocked out the referee in the ring. They took the fight through the crowd into one of the camera towers. Both men did whatever they could to inflict punishment such as Triple H beating the hell out of Taker with a chair & Taker responding with chokeslamming Triple H off the tower & delivering an elbow drop himself. They settled back into the ring where the sledgehammer came into play before Taker extended ""the streak.""WrestleMania X-7[Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]X No Disqualification Match vs. Ric Flair - This match was very personal to Flair after all the attacks that Undertaker made towards his friends & family to the point where Flair didn't do his usual ""stylin' & profilin'"" as he made his way to the ring but instead disrobed early & ran straight to the ring leading to both men fighting in the announce area within the first minute.  They were trading fist before Taker threw Flair into the turnbuckle with Flair looking to do his classic spot only for Taker to caught him with the boot on the apron.  Taker was dominate to the point where he busted Flair open just from his punches alone only for Flair to return to his ways of being ""the dirtiest player in the game"" to regain control & have Taker bleed but just continued to keep coming to the point where help came for Flair along with using a chair.  At this stage in Flair's career, this was definitely the best performance he had dating back to years before WCW closed while Taker was at the top of his game.WrestleMania X8XI vs. Big Show & A-Train - This happened during the era of Taker going under the biker gimmick as the ""American Bad Ass"" & with his original tag partner Nathan Jones being attacked earlier in the night, Taker had a handicap match here. Taker tried to get a quick win early here causing Show & Train to use the numbers advantage with double team power moves before Taker was able to use the strategy of divide & conquer and receive some help in order to keep the streak alive. This was pretty much what you would expect from a handicap match here but Taker had a better performance here against these two big than than he's had in the past at Mania at times against one.WrestleMania XIX[Undertaker 15-0]XII vs. Kane - Kane attacked & helped bury his brother alive at Survivor Series months earlier only for Taker to keep sending various messages to Kane for months teasing the return of Undertaker under his original persona of ""The Deadman"" but we ended up getting more than that as we also saw the return of Paul Bearer. This match was pretty short & sweet with Kane not believing that Taker was really there before Taker not only showed him that he was back & dominated his way to victory over his brother in a way that showed that the ""Deadman"" is back.WrestleMania XX[Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker; Undertaker 15-0]XIII vs. Randy Orton - ""The Legend Killer"" was out to end the legend of Undertaker's streak as Orton kept trying to go for quick covers early to no avail. Both men would go on to exchange punches with Taker attempting his Dragon Sleeper submission that was countered into a DDT & later countering the chokeslam into an RKO as both men traded momentum causing Randy to resort to desperate tactics including an appearance from his father using his trademark cast on his arm before Orton's overconfidence at one point came back to haunt him & cost him the match. Orton came into this match with an injury that would eventually have him out of action throughout the spring & summer so this was as good as it could be taking that into consideration as they would go on to have better matches throughout the rest of the year.WrestleMania 21XIV Casket Match vs. Mark Henry - Another Mania first in that this was the first casket match at the event. In a nutshell, Mark Henry was another limited big man so the match was a slow paced brawl as this was one of those cases where the stipulation definitely helped more than it would have been if they had a regular match. Nothing special here past the fact that this was the first casket match at Mania.WrestleMania 22[Undertaker 15-0]XV vs. World Champion Batista - Taker's Undefeated Streak vs. Batista's Title and I'll be point blank honest, this was the match that should have ended the show. This was Batista's best showing since his series against Triple H around a year earlier as he stepped up his game & didn't show any lack of effort like most of his previous performances. This was a classic ""big money"" WrestleMania match & the match of the night for me as you saw the crowd off the chain throughout the bout & even moments where it looked like Batista was going to end the streak & with various moments to look out for like Undertaker's big dive onto Batista, Batista's running powerslam through the announce table, and Batista taking it to the air with a flying shoulderblock off the top. It's ironic that this was the 20 year anniversary of WrestleMania 3 but Undertaker walks out of his WM the same way he did 10 years earlier...as a champion.[Greatest Stars Of The 21st Century; Undertaker 15-0]XVI vs. World Champion Edge - Edge finally made it into the WrestleMania main event that various people (myself included) felt should have been his years ago & I guess WWE learned their lesson from last year in putting the Undertaker title match on last since he usually delivers...and this was no exception. Edge worked on Taker's back throughout various parts of the match with the match getting better & better as time went on with a couple of near falls that would have had you convinced that he was actually going to lose. Justice was served after what happened close to a year earlier as Taker regained his championship from Edge thanks to ""that choke hold"" (Devil's Gate).WrestleMania XXIV[Top 50 Superstars Of All Time; You Think You Know Me: The Story Of Edge]XVII vs. Shawn Michaels - This is one of those matches that I can try to describe & review but the words wouldn't do it justice. This match had everything (including the unique ""Heaven & Hell"" entrances) on a physical & emotional level of both men refusing to lose to the point where this was the closest anyone had ever come to breaking the streak to the point where you saw the most emotion from Undertaker since his ""Deadman"" character returned 5 years ago & Shawn was even so desperate at one point, he was hoping for a win via countout. Instant classic here & quite frankly, this was the match that saved this show & should have ended it since nobody was going to be able to top it.25th Anniversary Of WrestleMania[Shawn Michaels: My Journey]XVIII No Disqualification/No Count Out Match vs. Shawn Michaels - Seeing how this is only the fourth time in WrestleMania history & the first time in 15 years that a non-title match is the final match at WrestleMania, you could tell that the quality they delivered last year was enough to warrant the closing position. Although these two put on such a memorable classic last year, they were able to put on another classic but different match this year as the stipulations of only winning by pinfall/submission along with the story of Shawn being so obsessed with ending the streak that he risked his own career...this match was more intense than the last one right from the opening moment when Shawn did Taker's trademark signature ""throat slash"" at the start. Taker hurt his leg early in the match giving Shawn the advantage by heavily working over that leg with various moves like the figure four & even the anklelock. Things really picked up from here with such moments as Shawn getting the tombstone on the floor, HBK executing a moonsault that you have to see to believe, and being able to counter moves from Undertaker that nobody else was able to counter before him while Taker himself was able to keep getting up from everything Shawn delivered. I don't want to reveal the ending but the match had such an effect on Taker to the point where he showed more emotion towards Shawn that we've seen from ""The Dead Man"" before Shawn refused to go out without a fight. As what has been the case with most of the matches here, keep watching after the match as you got got a very emotional WrestleMania moment.WrestleMania XXVI[Best PPV Matches Of 2009-2010; Superstar Collection: Shawn Michaels]XIX No Holds Barred Match vs. Triple H - Both men started out trading punches with Taker getting aggressive first by tossing Triple H over the top, ramming him into the steps, and taking apart the spanish announce table. Triple H returned the aggression with tackling Taker through the ""Colemine"" & taking apart the english announce table...only to be slammed off it to the floor. A few scary moments happened such as when Taker did his famous dive over the top ropes to the floor & he wasn't caught by Triple H coming close to landing right on his neck while later Taker took a chairshot right to the head (just knowing about concussions now makes me cringe when I see that). Both men turned up the punishment various times such as a spinebuster through the spanish table, trading chairshots, a DDT on the chair, and both kicking out of finishers including 3 separate pedigrees to the point where Triple H was just screaming ""STAY DOWN...JUST DIE...WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU!?!"" Triple H said before this match that he was going to finish the streak or die trying...well those words rang true but after the match, he wasn't the only person who died trying to accomplish their goal. It was different than their match a decade ago at WrestleMania but this was one that could stand out on it's own.WrestleMania XXVII[Best PPV Matches Of 2011]XX Hell In A Cell Match w/Special Referee Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H - Couple of notes here as Jim Ross returned to join commentary for this match, Michael Cole pointed out the interesting facts that not only has Triple H has won more HIAC matches than Undertaker but also never lost a match where Shawn was the referee, and Undertaker finally revealed his new haircut. Taker was dominate at the start as he targeted Triple H's head using anything he could get his hands on from the steps to the cell, and his own head to deliver headbutts causing HHH to have a bad bruise on his face. The steps were put into the ring where Triple H was able to deliver a spinebuster only for Taker to apply the Hell's Gate right after before Triple H showcased his strength & dead-lifted Taker to get out of the hold. Shawn played an important role as the referee as both guys got physical with him at times while also trying to be the voice of reason such as when Triple H continued to deliver non-stop chairshots to Taker's back to the point where Shawn tried to step in telling him, ""just pin him because you know he won't give up!"" only for Triple H to respond ""You end it or I will!"" This was physically brutal as both men didn't hold back with the chairshots & other weapons while just beating each other into exhaustion & Shawn definitely played an important role here. This lived up to the hype, no questions asked.WrestleMania XXVIIIBlu-Ray extras include a photo album and various history packages (24 vs. Edge, 26 vs. HBK, 27 & 28 vs. Triple H).  The documentary wasn't much as a highlight reel with the various talents speaking on their Mania encounters with Taker while others offer their opinions but it didn't go past more than 37 minutes.  Some of the matches themselves weren't much early on past either quick dominate squashes or just the gimmick of him fighting other limited big men (Snuka, Roberts, Gonzales, Bundy, Boss Man, Henry) but a majority of them were quality in their own right so unless you already have every single WrestleMania already in your collection, this is a set I would recommend.Side Note: The K-Mart version of

1537196,A2H1WNB30JNAWU,B007RMQ4HC,Jack D. Lowry,"[0, 0]","The Undertaker is by far one of the single best wrestlers of all the WWE wrestlers of all time.  Some people might aruge with me about who is the greatest of all time but in my viewpoint Undertaker is in my top 10 wrestlers.  I am going to do my review from a different prespective you have on Disc 2, 3, 4 the actual matches he made the streak at Wrestlemania.  It all started at Wrestlemania 7 and has gone to Wrestlemaia 28 DVD set wise.  He has taken on superstars like Big Show, Triple HHH (three times), Kane (twice), and Shawn Micheals (twice).  But what got me from watching the DVD set was Wrestlemania 14, 15, 17, and 18 with the WWE blurring out the WWF symbol for the PPV.  Then at Wrestlemania 19 becomes the WWE symbol it is now a days.  But if your a true fan of the Undertaker and want to see his power from early days, to his riding a motorcycle to the ring to his new improved dark side clothes for now a days then this is the DVD set for you.  His quickest matches range from  6 minutes to 10 minutes.  His longest matches were with Triple HHH, Shawn Micheals, and Edge ranging from 24 minutes to 30 minutes for each match.  For those who do buy this set just remeber Undertaker didn't particapate in all the Mania's he miss out on Wrestlemania 10 and 16 I do believe because of injury.  But he has had matches in Wrestlemania 17 to 29 so 13 Mania's in a row now well find out soon hopefully if it will be number 14 in a row at 2014 Wrestlemania 30.  As for the finishing moves my favorite will always be the tombstone follow up with the last ride, and hells gate.  I personally didn't like the Undertaker as a bad guy during the attitude phase.  I always perfer him as a good guy character and I hope you all do too.  So in closing if your looking for a great set of Mania matches featuring the Undertaker then pick this set up and savor it as much as I did well worth the money.",5,Actually a great look into the streak of the Undertaker,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,1899,"['Undertaker', 'far', 'one', 'single', 'best', 'wrestlers', 'WWE', 'wrestlers', 'time', 'people', 'might', 'aruge', 'who', 'greatest', 'time', 'viewpoint', 'Undertaker', 'top', '10', 'wrestlers', 'am', 'going', 'do', 'review', 'different', 'prespective', 'have', 'Disc', '2', '3', '4', 'actual', 'matches', 'made', 'streak', 'Wrestlemania', 'started', 'Wrestlemania', '7', 'gone', 'Wrestlemaia', '28', 'DVD', 'set', 'wise', 'taken', 'superstars', 'Big', 'Show', 'Triple', 'HHH', 'three', 'times', 'Kane', 'twice', 'Shawn', 'Micheals', 'twice', 'what', 'got', 'watching', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'Wrestlemania', '14', '15', '17', '18', 'WWE', 'blurring', 'out', 'WWF', 'symbol', 'PPV', 'Then', 'Wrestlemania', '19', 'WWE', 'symbol', 'now', 'days', 'true', 'fan', 'Undertaker', 'want', 'see', 'power', 'early', 'days', 'riding', 'motorcycle', 'ring', 'new', 'improved', 'dark', 'side', 'clothes', 'now', 'days', 'then', 'DVD', 'set', 'quickest', 'matches', 'range', '6', 'minutes', '10', 'minutes', 'longest', 'matches', 'were', 'Triple', 'HHH', 'Shawn', 'Micheals', 'Edge', 'ranging', '24', 'minutes', '30', 'minutes', 'match', 'who', 'do', 'buy', 'set', 'just', 'remeber', 'Undertaker', 'did', ""n't"", 'particapate', 'Mania', 'out', 'Wrestlemania', '10', '16', 'do', 'believe', 'injury', 'had', 'matches', 'Wrestlemania', '17', '29', 'so', '13', 'Mania', 'row', 'now', 'well', 'find', 'out', 'soon', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'number', '14', 'row', '2014', 'Wrestlemania', '30', 'finishing', 'moves', 'favorite', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'tombstone', 'follow', 'up', 'last', 'ride', 'hells', 'gate', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'Undertaker', 'bad', 'guy', 'attitude', 'phase', 'always', 'perfer', 'good', 'guy', 'character', 'hope', 'do', 'too', 'So', 'closing', 'looking', 'great', 'set', 'Mania', 'matches', 'featuring', 'Undertaker', 'then', 'pick', 'set', 'up', 'savor', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'well', 'money']",N/A
1537197,A3N0LBOUQAD1BG,B007RMQ4HC,"Jonnathan Ritland ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""","[2, 3]","For over 20 years The Undertaker has dominated the WWE, easily becoming one of if not the most feared entity to ever grace a wrestling ring. This is a DVD set featuring a documentary about his 20-0 streak, along with every one of his Wrestlemania contests showing why Taker is seen as such a legendary competitor.The documentary sadly isn't much, comments from a lot of Taker's opponents both at Wrestlemania and in other matches, like Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Kevin Nash and others as they talk about some of their favorite matches featuring Taker and how his streak will never be replicated. Its an ok fluff piece but god forbid if WWE featured comments from the man himself about all his classics at the biggest PPV of the year.Matches on Disc Two-3/24/91, Wrestlemania VII, vs. ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka: This is Taker's debut at the WWE's flagship PPV and its not much of one, Snuka hits a few moves but mainly gets squashed by the Deadman. Taker hits a diving clothesline, chops and wears down Jimmy, then hits the Tombstone and covers to win. 5/10.-4/5/92, Wrestlemania VIII, vs. Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts: After turning face just before this Taker was out to destroy Roberts, at least this was more competitive than the previous match, Jake hit two DDT's but Taker sat up (which wasn't too common at that time), hit a Tombstone on the outside then rolls Roberts into the ring and covers him to win. 6/10.-4/4/93, Wrestlemania IX, vs. Giant Gonzalez: At the Royal Rumble Gonzales had attacked Taker leaving him out cold in the ring for a few, so we have this match which makes the Deadman's rivalry with the Great Khali years later seem like a classic set of matches when compared to this. The opening staredown was interesting, unfortunately we are treated to one slow and boring move after another. Taker has to try so hard as he oversells big time to Gonzalez, it ends up with a DQ finish which is the only time one of Taker's matches ended not so cleanly. 2/10.-4/2/95, Wrestlemania XI, vs. King Kong Bundy: This was another one featuring the Phenom taking on someone bigger than him, Bundy uses his size to wear down Taker, however he does comeback hitting some big clotheslines and even survives Bundy's Avalanche splash in the corner. Taker does hit an impressive slam on the near 500lb. Bundy then a diving clothesline off the top, covers for three to win. 5/10.-3/31/96, Wrestlemania XII, vs. Diesel: Very good big man/big man match, that saw lots of power moves and the momentum changed a few times, but Diesel actually had Taker beat after hitting two Jacknife powerbombs but he didn't go for the cover. It came back to bite him as Taker rose up from the mat and soon after hit the Tombstone, makes the cover and defeats Big Daddy Cool. 8/10.-3/23/97, Wrestlemania 13, No Disqualification Match for the WWE Championship, vs. Sycho Sid (Champion): Not a bad one here, though Sid as intimidating as he looked was limited in the ring, Taker did make him look good while getting his own power moves in. Sid did almost have the Deadman beat a couple of times but he finally fell victim to the Tombstone, Taker covers and wins his first WWE title at a Wrestlemania. 6/10.-3/29/98, Wrestlemania XIV, Brother vs. Brother, vs. Kane: After he swore he would never fight his brother, Taker was pushed to far and said he would send his brother to hell. This is one of the few Wrestlemania matches where Taker had to fight from underneath as Kane just seemed to have his number, as he countered his brother's moves, while nothing that Taker did seemed to keep Kane down. It took three Tombstones for Taker to finally defeat Kane and win the match. 8/10.-3/28/99, Wrestlemania XV, Hell In A Cell Match, vs. Big Boss Man: Such a bad HIAC match that it wasn't included in the HIAC compliation released a couple of years ago, they don't make much use of the cell itself, its badly paced, nothing really exciting. They do hit some stiff punches and kicks on each other, Bossman does use some handcuffs on Taker locking him to the cell wall, but they break soon after in a funny spot. Taker ends up winning this after hitting the Tombstone for three. 3/10.-4/1/01, Wrestlemania X-Seven, vs. Triple H: This was an amazing fight that was much better than the one they had at Wrestlemania 27 and it was a straight up brawl. These two actually spent more time outside the ring as they brawled into the crowd and Taker chokeslammed Triple H off of a staging area. Later back in the ring, Taker goes for the Last Ride but Trips finds the sledgehammer and hits him with it, but can't keep Taker down. While up in the corner Trips is beating up Taker then gets caught in the Last Ride, the deadman makes the cover and wins the match. 10/10.Disc 3-3/17/02, Wrestlemania X8, No Disqualification Match, vs. Ric Flair: After Taker targeted Flair's family for weeks, Ric finally gave in and agreed to face/off with the Deadman. Awesome entrance by Taker and the match started out with Flair attacking and taking the action to the outside, chopping and punching. Once Taker got the advantage it was all about how much Flair could take. He did make his comeback and Ric's old friend Arn Anderson made an appearance giving the spinebuster to Taker. However the Deadman would not be denied as he ended up hitting the Tombstone to go to 10-0 at Wrestlemania. 9/10.-3/30/03, Wrestlemania XIX, Handicap Match, vs. Big Show & A-Train:  After Taker's partner Nathan Jones was taken out prior to the event, the phenom was forced to contend with two of the biggest in pro wrestling. He did well taking out both men with some power moves and unexpected submission wrestling, Show & A-Train do work over Taker for a bit. Nathan Jones does come down, knocking out Show in the aisleway, then hits a big kick on A-Train in the ring, Taker hits the Tombstone and covers. 5/10.-3/14/04, Wrestlemania XX, vs. Kane:  If I could rate this on build-up alone it would be a 10/10, as the promos and everything leading up to this match was top notch. The entrances were both good especially Takers as the crowd was on its feet from the opening gong. The match however was typical big man vs. big man, not bad but not great. Taker ends up hitting the Tombstone to win. 6/10.-4/3/05, Wrestlemania 21, vs. Randy Orton: Good to great one here, Taker did well and the pace was pretty fast throughout with very little down time. Orton shined here as he literally was a fraction of a second from ending the streak after a great Tombstone reversal into an RKO. Randy's dad ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton makes an appearance but it doesn't derail the Phenom as he hits the Tombstone and covers to win the match. 9/10.-4/2/06, Wrestlemania 22, Casket Match, vs. Mark Henry: The entrances with the druids and the casket and for the Undertaker were the best parts of the match. This was when WWE was trying to push Henry as a monster heel and it worked to a point but honestly did anyone feel he would beat Undertaker and end the streak? Taker tries and gets some good out of Henry but its a sluggish match at best, he does hit his trademark dive to the outside though. Taker hits the tombstone on the 400+lb. Henry and rolls him into the casket and closes the lid to win. 5/10.-4/1/07, Wrestlemania 23, World Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. Batista (Champion): Wow how this wasn't higher on the PPV card I'll never know, they worked so well together countering each others moves on several occasions. These two delivered big time in a match where the animal gave it his all to end the streak but in the end Taker hits the Tombstone to become the World Champion. There aren't enough words to describe this match, watch it an enjoy. 10/10.-3/30/08, Wrestlemania XXIV, World Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. Edge (Champion): This is the definition of main event, these two put on a hell of a match. The momentum went back and forth and at times you felt like Edge may have actually had Taker's number. Taker of course did hit his trademark dive like he does every Wrestlemania. Edge hit a massive spear, went for the cover but Taker kicked out. Edge hit a second spear, but as he gloated Taker locked on the Hell's Gate submission out of nowhere and Edge had no choice but to tap out. Taker wins the World title for the second year in a row at Wrestlemania. 10/10.Disc 4-4/5/09, Wrestlemania 25, vs. Shawn Michaels: Whatever I say will pale in comparison to the match itself. From the entrances for both men, to the the numerous close falls, to Taker's dive over the top rope and landing on his head, to Michaels kicking out of a Tombstone and being the one man you felt could end the undefeated streak and he almost did. It goes for 30 minutes of high impact action, Taker hits a second Tombstone and finally keeps Michaels down for three. 11/10.-3/28/10, Wrestlemania XXVI, Streak vs. Career No Holds Barred Match, vs. Shawn Michaels: Last year these two had a match that should've been the main event of Wrestlemania, this time they are in the spotlight as they close the show, where if Shawn doesn't win he will retire. Is it as good as their match last year? No, how could it be? However its nearly as good and trying to describe a Shawn/Taker match is pretty much impossible, Shawn uses plenty of submission moves, Taker uses his power and there are plenty of memorable moments. At the end Michaels keeps trying to rise up, Taker yells at him to ""Stay down"", Shawn slaps Taker which causes the Deadman to hit a devastating Tombstone that keeps Michaels down for three, thus ending the career of HBK. 10/10.-4/3/11, Wrestlemania XXVII, No Holds Barred Match, vs. Triple H: Great entrances by both men, sadly the songs featured on the live PPV are dubbed over. The pacing of the match is pretty slow, though the moves they pull off are impactful, like a spine-buster by Triple H through the announce table and Taker's dive to the outside looked painful. After this the match dissolves into each wrestler hitting finishers one after another, including Triple H hitting 3 pedigress (the last 2 of which looked really bad). Triple H hit Taker with numerous chair shots and kept telling him to stay down, paying homage to Wrestlemania 26 with Taker and Michaels. The finish comes when Taker locks in Hells Gate out of nowhere and after semmingly forever Triple H finally taps out. 7/10. The whole build-up and the match felt like they were trying to force a storyline and it didn't really work.-4/1/12, Wrestlemania XXVIII, End of an Era Hell in a Cell Match, vs. Triple H, w/Special Guest Referee, Shawn Michaels: After last year's clash that left both men beaten down, Taker to the point that he couldn't leave under his own power, we have this match in the ultimate proving ground, Hell In A Cell. Loved the entrances by both men, Taker's jacket looked awesome and his entrance take forever like it usually does and he displayed a new shaven head. They start punching out each other, Taker hammers Trips on the outside slamming him into the cage wall a few times.The fight continues in and out of the ring and Taker keeps up the offense, hitting his trademark leg drop on the ring apron crushing Trips throat. He comes back hitting the spinebuster onto the steel steps, but Taker goes for Hells Gate, Trips pulls him up and slams him down but only for two. Once the chairs and weapons are brought into play it gets hardcore as Trips crushes Taker with a chair numerous times, it reaches a point where Michaels says he should just cover him.Taker does rise to his feet but gets knocked down again, Trips brings out the sledgehammer and argues with Shawn saying he will end this. Trips goes for the hammer blow but Shawn prevents it and throws it out the ring, Shawn goes to ring the bell but stops himself which angers Trips and causes Taker to lock Hells Gate on Michaels. Taker then locks on Hells Gate on Trips but Shawn is down and can't make the count. Charles Robinson comes down to make the count after a chokeslam but only for two, then Charles gets the chokeslam.Shawn hits Sweet Chin Music on Taker, then the pedigdree but only for two, Trips throws Michaels out of the ring and Taker sits back up and takes it to Trips hitting the Tombstone but only for two. Both men trade blows as Shawn looks on torn about what he must do, we have another pedigree but again just a two count. Taker grabs the chair and returns the favor from earlier slamming it into Trips over and over, but just gets a two count, Taker hits a sledgehammer shot then the tombstone and covers for three. 11/10. Wow, just wow.If you don't have most of Taker's Wrestlemania matches on DVD already then this is worth getting, however if you have most of them in your collection then this really isn't a great set to have.",3,The Phenom's impressive streak on DVD,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,12739,"['20', 'years', 'Undertaker', 'dominated', 'WWE', 'easily', 'becoming', 'one', 'not', 'most', 'feared', 'entity',

I also would of liked to see extra footage or a roundtable discussion about the Undertakers legacy. These are all of his WrestleMania matches in their entirety. This is a must own for fans of WWE and the Undertaker. My opinion is his match at WrestleMania 25 against Shawn Michaels was the best match ever and I don't think we'll see another like that for many years.

The first release,WWE - Undertaker 15-0, was a mediocre release that bastardized many of the matches by editing and cutting them up.  Fortunately, this is one of the many places where The Streak far exceeds the aforementioned release.  All of the matches here are shown in their entirety (with the exception of the hanging of the Big Boss Man at Wrestlemania XV) and contain (in part) interviews which is something the 15-0 release failed to deliver on, even though it stated on the case it contained.Comparisons aside, this is an overall great retrospective of the Undertaker's illustrious Wrestlemania streak.  I have watched the Undertaker for close to 20 years, but whether you're a long time fan or someone relatively new to the Undertaker or wrestling in general, this in a fantastic collection that anyone can pick up and appreciate.While I do think this is a great set to have, especially for collectors, it does fall short in some areas.  My biggest grievance is that the documentary on disc 1 is approximately 40 minutes in length and doesn't contain much substance.  There's no input or insight from the Dead Man himself, which was disappointing.  Another downfall to this set is that there is not much new here.  All of these matches can be found on other WWF/E releases, but it's convenient to have them all in one place.There are a plethora of reviews here with the match listing, so to prevent overkill, I won't provide that.

Swan,"[1, 3]","For the very first time ever, WWE Home Video has finally released a classic 4-disc DVD set that chronicles an unparalleled achievement within the world of sports entertainment. ""Undertaker - The Streak"" takes a look at the milestone record of the phenom known as the Undertaker with his entire series of victories at the grandest stage of them all, Wrestlemania. This legendary superstar has done something that no one else has ever achieved, before or since: remain undefeated at Wrestlemania for a record-shattering 20-0 victories. His list of opponents that he has faced at each event reads like a who's-who in WWE history: Superfly Jimmy Snuka, Jake 'The Snake' Roberts, Giant Gonzalez, King Kong Bundy, Diesel, Sycho Sid, Kane, Big Boss Man, Triple H, Ric Flair, Big Show, A-Train, Randy Orton, Mark Henry, Batista, Edge and Shawn Michaels have all fallen victim to the dead man's wrath within the confines of the squared circle. Each and every time, the phenom has always prevailed and triumphed. Whether the stipulations were a handicap match, Hell In A Cell, No disqualification, or even trying to win a championship, this iconic superstar has never failed to entertain and amaze all of us within the WWE Universe. Every Wrestlemaina match is presented in chronological order and each one is also seen in its entirety. This is also a perfect way to watch the progression of this extraordinary competitor throughout the last two decades, as he makes history with a record 20 consecutive wins at the showcase of the immortals. This DVD is unique, in that it focuses on one individual and one event. It is also notable for the fact that Undertaker has faced Kane and Shawn Michaels on 2 seperate occasions each while he faced Triple H a total of 3 times. No matter who the phenom stepped into the ring with, he always gets his hand raised in a token of victory. This unbelievable, undefeated streak has definitely earned this man the right to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Just his mere presence at Wreslemania alone should definitely be more than enough incentive for this remarkable accolade. To those of you who are planning to purchase this DVD, you are in for something special.

1537206,A1L7PH0CS9BHP6,B007RMQ4HC,Tom,"[0, 0]","I wanted to start off by saying that I have loved the Undertaker character from the first moment that I laid eyes on him.  I loved the way he came out to the organ music, never smiling, never really showing any emotion.  I loved it when the children in the audience cried or looked on in complete amazement.  There was just something about his character that I loved when I first saw him in 1990 and still love to this day.  This is a set that chronicles his amazing streak of (at the time) 20 wins and zero losses at the show of shows:  Wrestlemania!The documentary that is included with the set is pretty much just a half hour blurb of his WM career and features interviews with some of his opponents at WM.  I do wish that the WWE would let this man come out of character and speak every once in a while.  I mean there is no one in their right mind (except maybe a child) who believes that this man is really The Undertaker 24/7.  We know what a &#34;character&#34; is so let's hear from him once in a blue moon.  I think it would have really nice to hear what he thought of each opponent and each WM he had.  He could have done like a little intro to each match.  Oh well, this is how the WWE wants to handle him so I guess we'll have to wait till he's retired before we get to hear from him.So the first match is the one that started the streak and features Taker taking on Jimmy Snuka at WM 7 in 1991.  This was a short match but showed Taker dominating the man who at the time was the Phenom in the WWE.  It lasted all of about 5 minutes and began maybe the greatest streak in the history of wrestling.Number 2 took place at WM 8 in 1992 and featured Taker taking on Jake Roberts.  I remember the build up to this match was really good with them two attacking Randy Savage and Elizabeth at their wedding reception and then Taker turning on Jake.  I loved when Jake locked Taker's hand in a coffin on the Funeral Parlor show and Taker started after Jake dragging the coffin behind him.  The match at WM was another short one clocking in at about 6 minutes but it was still fun and entertaining.  Another win for the dead man.Number 3 took place at WM 9 and featured Taker taking on Giant Gonzales.  Most people hate this match but I kind of liked it.  I mean it was so great to see Taker take on a guy who stood 7 feet 7 inches, the staredown alone that these guys had was just intense.  Fun match and is the only time that Taker won a match by DQ in his WM streak.Number 4 took place at WM 11 in 1995 and featured Taker taking on King Kong Bundy.  Taker had to miss competing at WM 10 due to serious back injuries but would be back for this WM.  Unfortunatly, this may have been the worst WM match of his career as well as the worst storyline of his career.  See back in January, I think IRS had taken his urn for failure to pay taxes or some crap.  So Taker beat him but the urn was still in the hands of the Million Dollar Corp.  So now Taker had to take on KKB.  Very slow match and very boring!  Not worth seeing.  I do remember taking getting the urn back for a few minutes before Kama came out and took it back and said he was going to melt it down into a huge chain which he did!  Just a terrible storyline and match.Number 5 took place at WM 12 in 1996 and featured Taker taking on Diesel.  This is a great match, his first real test when it comes to the streak.  I thought Diesel had a great chance in beating Taker but it was not to be.  The match is a very good one, especially with two bigger guys going at it.  Well worth checking out.Number 6 took place at WM 13 in 1997 and featured Taker taking on Sid for the World title.  I remember there being much confusion around the world title at the time cause Shawn Michaels didn't want to drop it to Bret Hart and Bret didn't want to lose to Shawn so Shawn lost his smile and Bret had that awesome match with Austin at this even and anyway they ended putting Taker and Sid together for the title.  No one, except maybe Chris Benoit, has ever had a great match with Sid and this was no different.  I honestly, have never been able to sit through this match the whole way without falling asleep.  It's just too plodding and dull and too long.  The match goes like 21:00 but should have maybe been cut to 15:00 or so.  Not a good match but is worth seeing Taker win his first world title in like 6 years (he would win his first in 1991).Number 7 took place at WM 14 in 1998 and featured Taker taking on Kane.  First of all, this features one of my favorite Taker storylines ever!  The things they were able to do with these two guys was just awesome from a special effects POV.  The match itself was really good.  It was brutal and well thought out and had some great spots in it.  Well worth checking out.Number 8 took place at WM 15 and featured Taker taking on Bossman in a Hell in a Cell match.  Unfortunatly, because of the Shawn/Taker HIAC match and the Taker/Mankind HIAC match, I think people expected WAY too much from this one.  This was a crap match on a crap show.  I remember when I saw WM 15 I thought it reminded me of a hyped up Raw or something like that, not worth seeing.  This is probably the worst HIAC match of all time and if you watch this one, you'll see why.  The aftermath when the match is over is worth seeing but other than that, it's not!Number 9 took place at WM 17 and had Taker taking on Triple H in a No DQ match.  Another match where I thought Taker's streak was in serious jeopardy.  This was a fantastic match from start to finish and was the first WM match where Taker wrestled as his biker character.  Another match well worth seeing.Number 10 (halfway there) took place at WM 18 and had Taker taking on Ric Flair in a No DQ match.  On paper, I thought this match was going to be terrible but when it took place, it almost stole the show.  If not for Hogan/Rock that year, this may have been match of the night.  Flair and Taker went hold for hold on each other and tore the roof off the the Skydome.  Blood and violence made this a great match.Number 11 took place at WM 19 and had Taker taking on Big Show and Albert.  This was the only time that Taker had been involved in a handicapped match.  I believe Nathan Jones was to have been Taker's partner but they had him go down with an injury cause they didn't think he was ready for the big show.  The match itself is ok, not great, but worth seeing.Number 12 took place at WM 20 and had Taker taking on Kane again.  Taker was back as the dead man for this match and I was really looking forward to his return.  I didn't think Paul Bearer would be with him but that just made it even more enjoyable.  The match was short and not as good as WM 14 but just to see Taker as Taker again was enough for me.Number 13 took place at WM 21 and had Taker taking on Randy Orton.  I remember when this match was signed I thought it would not be a good match.  I thought Taker would dominate the match from the opening bell.  Boy was I wrong!  This was a very very good match and I think helped to establish Orton as a major player in the WWE.  This match was back and forth and just really really good.Number 14 took place at WM 22 and had Taker taking on Mark Henry in a coffin match.  This would be the first time the coffin would be used at WM.  Much like Sid, Henry is a hard person to have a good match with.  Taker tried but the match itself just isn't all that good.  At least it didn't last forever and ever.  It was pretty short with Taker putting Henry out of his misery.Number 15 took place at WM 23 and had Taker taking on Batista for the world heavyweight title.  To me, this match is the start of the streak that featured awesome performances from Taker and his opponents.  This was another legit threat to his streak but what a match!  This one was back and forth up and down.  Very good contest.  When it was over, I don't think any of the over 80,000 fans in attendance were sitting down.  Just lots of fun.Number 16 took place at WM 24 and had Taker taking on Edge for the world heavyweight title.  Another awesome match!  I know most people remember the Flair/Michaels match but for me this match with Taker and Edge was the match of the night.  So many reversals and false finishes and edge of your seat action is what makes this one a great one for me.  As a side note, I also liked the feud between these two, one of Taker's last great feuds.Number 17 took place at WM 25 and had Taker taking on Shawn Michaels.  WOW!!  That's all I can say about this match is WOW!!  This may be the greatest WM match of all time.  It had absolutely everything and then some.  Just a great match between two of the WWE's greatest wrestlers.  Just fantastic!!Number 18 took place at WM 26 and had Taker taking on Michaels again with Shawn's career on the line.  Another outstanding match, maybe not as good as WM 25, but still a fantastic match.  Loved it from start to finish and what a way for Shawn to go out.Number 19 took place at WM 27 and had Taker taking on Triple H in a No Holds Barred match.  This was a brutal match but well worth seeing.  They threw everything at each other and actually saved the show that year.  WM 27 has mostly been panned as being a dull and boring show but this is one of the jewels that night.  Awesome match, far better than their WM 17 match.Lastly, we get Taker taking on Triple H again in a Hell in a Cell match at WM 28 with Shawn as the special referee.  Loved this match from start to finish.  So much drama involved and I loved how the WWE and these three superstars actually closed a 4 year history on this match that started at WM 25 and ended here at WM 28.  Great match and another great showing from the deadman.All in all this is a set worth checking out.  It's great to see all of Taker's WM matches in one set.  As a side note, at WM 29, Taker extended his streak to 21-0 when he defeated CM Punk in another fantastic match.  Great set and can't wait to see who he takes on a WM 30.  I hear it's going to be Lesnar but I guess we'll have to wait and see.",5,Possibly the greatest streak of all time,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,10056,"['wanted', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'have',
