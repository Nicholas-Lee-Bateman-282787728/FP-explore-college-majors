Mardock Scramble is basically about a 15 year old, I guess now former prostitute. The story starts off with Balot being with a client only to get killed by the same client. Afterwards she's physically brought back to life only for the viewers to see how psychologically damaged she really is. This is what makes Mardock Scramble good to me as of all the complex moral dilemmas presented in this film.Mardock Scramble has gorgeous animations most of the time that just make you want to pause just to look at the sceneries. However there are some scenes that just feels out of place most of those are in the way the CGI cars are drawn. They just feel out of place because of how it's just there. This is probably my only gripe though. Everything else was excellent and I didn't even mind watching it in English and I normally prefer most of my animes in Japanese with English subs.Now if you don't mind basically a bare bone blu ray then go ahead and buy it as you won't be disappointed. This just comes with the theatrical and uncut versions of the film, Japanese trailers and previews. Keep in mind if you don't like a lot of nudity and / or child prostitution this will probably not be for you.",5,better than expected,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,1290,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', '2', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'storyline', 'can', 'read', 'elsewhere', 'Mardock', 'Scramble', 'basically', '15', 'year', 'old', 'guess', 'now', 'former', 'prostitute', 'story', 'Balot', 'being', 'client', 'only', 'get', 'killed', 'same', 'client', 'physically', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'only', 'viewers', 'see', 'how', 'psychologically', 'damaged', 'really', 'what', 'Mardock', 'Scramble', 'good', 'complex', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'presented', 'film.Mardock', 'Scramble', 'gorgeous', 'animations', 'most', 'time', 'just', 'make', 'want', 'pause', 'just', 'look', 'sceneries', 'However', 'are', 'scenes', 'just', 'place', 'most', 'are', 'way', 'CGI', 'cars', 'are', 'drawn', 'just', 'feel', 'place', 'how', 'just', 'there', 'probably', 'only', 'gripe', 'Everything', 'else', 'was', 'excellent', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'mind', 'watching', 'English', 'normally', 'prefer', 'most', 'animes', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subs.Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'basically', 'bare', 'bone', 'blu', 'ray', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'just', 'theatrical', 'uncut', 'versions', 'film', 'Japanese', 'trailers', 'previews', 'Keep', 'mind', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'lot', 'nudity', '/', 'child', 'prostitution', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be']",Mardock Scramble: The First Compression

Especially when the Blu-Ray costs more. So just stick to the DVD version instead and save some money.And in other news, I read that some folks compare this to Blade Runner or Ghost in the Shell and that is really not accurate. I could see it being closer to Ghost in the Shell than Blade Runner. But I am a huge fan of both films and this falls short of those on nearly every account. Plus I watch a ton of sci-fi and dystopian anime, even series not widely available in the states, and this is merely passable compared to much.The series seems to start off good enough, but then it fizzles out and doesn't really seem to recapture any steam. The characters seem to all be very flat archetypes without any real development, or any real draw for the viewer. Plus the 14 year old looking heroine is naked a lot. Not so much of a problem in Ghost in the Shell with the obviously adult Motoko, but in this I felt uncomfortable, like a peeping pedophile.There are a lot of adult themes but often it seems they are included just to 'grow up' the series. It's not worth watching if you are into deep and complex stories. I would say to check out the film and series for Ghost in the Shell if you haven't. Also Darker than Black is a good series with a dark spin. And there is always Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head. Even No.6 was better and I wasn't too keen on that series either (it was too short and the plot didn't have enough time to develop).There are better series out there, so just be aware before you buy this. Perhaps checking it out first on Netflix would be preferable. I was able to get the Blu-Ray from my local library so luckily I didn't plop $30 on this. And please don't hate me for this review, I would probably give it 3 stars except that the Blu-Ray version is pretty pointless with the grainy resolution (which I'm not sure was intentional - even the black background on the opening credits is horribly grainy).And also of note: this was based on a novel (which is available at my library) so I am thinking the novel might be much better than the anime.

This DVD contains the original theatrical cut of the movie that played in theaters.  The additional scenes with added nudity and sex were bonus features for the home video release in Japan.  It was known WELL AHEAD of time that was the theatrical cut on various anime sites, but Amazon failed to list enough info to let people make an informed decision.  This release is no different than buying the original cut of Star Wars, before all the added scenes George Lucas threw in later.It should be noted that the affected scenes do not actually affect the plot anyway and are basically just added nudity, sex, and fanservice.  They may also make some viewers uncomfortable as the main character can appear to be underaged to some.  If you feel this may bother you, then this version may be your best bet.As for the home video version, it is being released on DVD and Bluray in March 2012.

I myself avoided all spoilers, so didn't know anything about it before watching, and think this is one of those shows that is best enjoyed that way.I watched the directors cut with no point of reference of what the original ""uncencored"" version is and how that compares. But this version had some pretty explicit scenes (stopping just short of showing actual penetration scenes). And because our protagonist is a teenage prostitute, this is obviously controversial material in the USA, even being animated. However, in my opionion it never feels like it is done just to arouse the audience, but instead feels more of an emphasis of the gritty, dark, and sad world our young protagonist was trapped in.The show has a great techno futuristic angle on the story telling. It doesn't hold back on sex & violence, but all of that seems to fit within the theme & not feel forced in just for shock value.I did not know this was part of a trilogy when I starting watching it, although the ""First Compression"" in the title implies there is more.

If you are sensitive to rather shocking scenes and themes, you may want to steer clear of this. Balot's passed is filled with horrendous abuse and it plays out through her flashbacks. The themes are mature and violence and sex are all over the place. And Balot spends almost half the film nude.That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The cyberpunk/urban sci-fi setting is engrossing, the action is intense, and the story and characters are already (as this is the first installment and not the complete story - and it has one hell of a cliff-hanger!) vivid and compelling. I am excited about what comes next. Additionally - as I am one who enjoys some deeper analysis when I can find it - there is an underlying social commentary, particularly in regards to gender and power (which is made a tad ironic by the fact that Balot's clothes have a problem staying on) as well as abuse and trust. Not one to watch with the kids, but certainly a film that can be enjoyed and taken seriously (if you can catch your breath from the breakneck pace  of the action).",5,"very dark, very mature, very good.",1315612800,"09 10, 2011",2011,1768,"['Fasten', 'seatbelt', 'keep', 'arms', 'legs', 'vehicle', 'Mardock', 'Scramble', 'action', 'packed', 'emotion', 'jolt', 'veritable', 'Sin', 'City', 'meets', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Balot', 'victim', 'endless', 'abuse', 'tragedy', 'somehow', 'alive', 'having', 'been', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'thought', 'Now', 'chance', 'bring', 'killer', 'down', 'do', 'so', 'been', 'outfitted', 'synthetic', 'skin', 'rebuilt', 'body', 'amazing', 'powers', 'zany', 'Dr.', 'Easter', 'ever', 'reliable', 'more', 'human', 'humans', 'mouse/super', 'weapon', 'Oeufcocque', 'will', 'face', 'string', 'foes', 'horror', 'own', 'past', 'find', 'reason', 'keep', 'living.A', 'few', 'warnings', 'are', 'sensitive', 'rather', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'themes', 'may', 'want', 'steer', 'clear', 'Balot', 'passed', 'filled', 'horrendous', 'abuse', 'out', 'flashbacks', 'themes', 'are', 'mature', 'violence', 'sex', 'are', 'place', 'Balot', 'almost', 'film', 'being', 'said', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'cyberpunk/urban', 'sci-fi', 'setting', 'engrossing', 'action', 'intense', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'already', 'first', 'installment', 'not', 'complete', 'story', 'one', 'hell', 'cliff-hanger', 'vivid', 'compelling', 'am', 'excited', 'what', 'next', 'Additionally', 'am', 'one', 'who', 'deeper', 'analysis', 'when', 'can', 'find', 'underlying', 'social', 'commentary', 'particularly', 'regards', 'gender', 'power', 'made', 'tad', 'ironic', 'fact', 'Balot', 'clothes', 'have', 'problem', 'staying', 'as', 'well', 'abuse', 'trust', 'Not', 'one', 'watch', 'kids', 'certainly', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'taken', 'seriously', 'can', 'catch', 'breath', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'action']",Mardock Scramble: The First Compression
