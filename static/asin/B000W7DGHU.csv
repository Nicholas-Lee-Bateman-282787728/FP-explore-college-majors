As soon as I first started playing I was let down. Hogwarts Challenge promises that you go through the life of being a Hogwarts student by getting sorted, earning House Points, playing Quidditch, and dueling. These elements are barely present. Instead, you get a handful of mini-games that either involve memory or quick-time events, the latter of which is practically broken because poor response from the remote. Sadly, that's really all there is to this Interactive DVD Game. What's ironic is that on the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban DVD, there is a knight's quest game in the bonus features that is much better than this piece of junk.

I just got around to trying recently and what a piece of junk. The WB was just trying to get in a few extra bucks from the Christmas season. First, the controlls do not work AT ALL!! The staircase challange was stupid and the leavitation challange pretty much did what the disk wasnted to do and you have to choice. Potions wasn't hard, they just asked you the most stupidest thing, like what colores do you use to make purple. Listen, I am not an artist...I have NO IDEA!! They also forget to tell you that you have 5 seconds to answer. The Hegwig thing and the Quidditch final do not work at all. Bad controlls. I tried this disk on 3 different DVD players. I tried on the DVD player on the tv, it tried on the computer and I tried a portiable dvd player.
