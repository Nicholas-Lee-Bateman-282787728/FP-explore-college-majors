1286148,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B002RZARX6,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[1, 6]","This film reminded me of another Norwegian film,Hawaii, Oslo, and I discovered the director, Eric Poppe, is the same.  Although I did not care for Hawaii Oslo, my feelings lightened up for Troubled Water.  But both films were too long, too bizarre, and structured in a confusing manner.The film is structured in two parts, rather two voices; and if you don't pay strict attention, you may get confused.  A young man, Jan, spent time in prison for the alleged murder of a young boy.  The story begins after the prison release, where Jan, gets a job as a church organist.  Then, we learn what happened to this young boy in a stroller, taken from where a woman left him outside while she cleaned up inside a restroom.First of all, why is this kid, about 5 years old in a baby stroller?  Looks too big for that.  Then, this ""baby"" in a stroller jumps and runs into the river....little cheesy here!Then, the film shifts to the view of the mother whose kid was stolen and murdered.  When she discovers Jan was at her home talking with her husband, she goes ballistic trying to prevent Jan from doing so to another child and her neurosis triggers and she attempts to confront or expose him.  In the same meantime, her view of how the murder happened is revealed.Confused enough?  It's like a story after the story of the story.  What made this film confusing is the split structure.  First half is Jan's story, next is the mother's story.  But with the present intertwined with the past, it can get confusing.The film is about prison reform, atonement, forgiveness, there are too many unanswered questions.  Like I said, Director's other film, Hawaii Oslo is worse.  ....Rizzo",2,"Bizarre, confusing, too lengthy",1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,1669,"['film', 'reminded', 'Norwegian', 'film', 'Hawaii', 'Oslo', 'discovered', 'director', 'Eric', 'Poppe', 'same', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'Hawaii', 'Oslo', 'feelings', 'lightened', 'up', 'Troubled', 'Water', 'films', 'were', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'bizarre', 'structured', 'confusing', 'manner.The', 'film', 'structured', 'two', 'parts', 'rather', 'two', 'voices', 'do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'strict', 'attention', 'may', 'get', 'confused', 'young', 'man', 'Jan', 'spent', 'time', 'prison', 'alleged', 'murder', 'young', 'boy', 'story', 'prison', 'release', 'where', 'Jan', 'job', 'church', 'organist', 'Then', 'learn', 'what', 'happened', 'young', 'boy', 'stroller', 'taken', 'where', 'woman', 'left', 'cleaned', 'up', 'restroom.First', 'why', 'kid', '5', 'years', 'old', 'baby', 'stroller', 'Looks', 'too', 'big', 'Then', 'baby', 'stroller', 'jumps', 'river', '.little', 'cheesy', 'here', 'Then', 'film', 'shifts', 'view', 'mother', 'kid', 'was', 'stolen', 'murdered', 'When', 'Jan', 'was', 'home', 'talking', 'husband', 'ballistic', 'trying', 'prevent', 'Jan', 'doing', 'so', 'child', 'neurosis', 'triggers', 'confront', 'expose', 'same', 'meantime', 'view', 'how', 'murder', 'happened', 'revealed.Confused', 'enough', 'story', 'story', 'story', 'What', 'made', 'film', 'confusing', 'split', 'structure', 'First', 'half', 'Jan', 'story', 'next', 'mother', 'story', 'present', 'intertwined', 'past', 'can', 'get', 'confusing.The', 'film', 'prison', 'reform', 'atonement', 'forgiveness', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'said', 'Director', 'other', 'film', 'Hawaii', 'Oslo', 'worse', '.Rizzo']",Troubled Water
1286149,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002RZARX6,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I stumbled onto `Troubled Water' quite by accident.  I had never heard of the film or the actors or the director before and so it was a film that was not on my radar whatsoever.  But, I happened to come across it while channel surfing and finding one of those amazing `foreign language film stations' (Link) and I had to give it a try.This film is perfection.`Troubled Water' will crush you emotionally, so be prepared for that.  The story here is one that is built to give the audience an influx of emotions.  It will make you angry, it will make you sad, it will make you frustrated, it will make you smile.  The smiling is a mere reflection of the film's central embodiment of hope in redemption, but for the most part you'll have chills as you watch this tale unfold.  Without giving too much away, the film centers on a young man named Jan Thomas who has just been released from prison after killing a young boy in a garish theft gone very wrong.  He gets a job playing the organ at a local church, a skill he developed while behind bars.  He strikes up an unlikely relationship with the churches female pastor, Anna, who has a young son herself.  Jan seems to be working towards normalcy and obvious redemption until Agnes, the mother of the young boy he murdered, notices him at the church.  Agnes is still convinced that Jan is a danger and so she begins fraying at the edges, seeking for a way to destroy what he has started to create.Told in two parts, each part focusing on different aspects of the unfolding tragedy, `Troubled Water' is a stunning character study that fleshes out the purest feelings of guilt, remorse, anger and grief.  The way that Harold Rosenlow-Eeg fleshes out this story and the way that Erik Poppe directed each moment is flawless.  I can't think of another film that really embellishes those feelings of grief quite as effectively as this one, outside of `In the Bedroom'.  Some have complained that it doesn't give us many `answers' but that isn't the point of the story.  This isn't a story about `what happened' or `what will happen' as much as it's a story about the purgatory state of `what happens when we try to move on'.The entire cast is stunning here, but Pal Sverre Valheim Hagen, Trine Dyrholm and Ellen Dorrit Petersen are all exceptionally effective in this film.  Dyrholm has a difficult task of unearthing her character's pain and fury without going overboard and feeling like a caricature.  She manages marvelously, and her final confrontation with her oppressor of sorts is a stunning splice of film acting.Soft and intimate yet packing a serious punch, `Troubled Water' is an unforgettable film experience.",5,The water is suffocating...,1344988800,"08 15, 2012",2012,2662,"['stumbled', 'Troubled', 'Water', 'quite', 'accident', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'actors', 'director', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'radar', 'whatsoever', 'happened', 'come', 'channel', 'surfing', 'finding', 'one', 'amazing', 'foreign', 'language', 'film', 'stations', 'Link', 'had', 'give', 'try.This', 'film', 'perfection.', 'Troubled', 'Water', 'will', 'crush', 'emotionally', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'story', 'here', 'one', 'built', 'give', 'audience', 'influx', 'emotions', 'will', 'make', 'angry', 'will', 'make', 'sad', 'will', 'make', 'frustrated', 'will', 'make', 'smile', 'smiling', 'mere', 'reflection', 'film', 'central', 'embodiment', 'hope', 'redemption', 'most', 'part', ""'ll"", 'have', 'chills', 'watch', 'tale', 'unfold', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'film', 'centers', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Jan', 'Thomas', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'prison', 'killing', 'young', 'boy', 'garish', 'theft', 'gone', 'very', 'wrong', 'job', 'playing', 'organ', 'local', 'church', 'skill', 'developed', 'bars', 'up', 'unlikely', 'relationship', 'churches', 'female', 'pastor', 'Anna', 'who', 'young', 'son', 'Jan', 'be', 'working', 'towards', 'normalcy', 'obvious', 'redemption', 'Agnes', 'mother', 'young', 'boy', 'murdered', 'church', 'Agnes', 'still', 'convinced', 'Jan', 'danger', 'so', 'fraying', 'edges', 'seeking', 'way', 'destroy', 'what', 'started', 'create.Told', 'two', 'parts', 'part', 'focusing', 'different', 'aspects', 'unfolding', 'tragedy', 'Troubled', 'Water', 'stunning', 'character', 'study', 'out', 'purest', 'feelings', 'guilt', 'remorse', 'anger', 'grief', 'way', 'Harold', 'Rosenlow-Eeg', 'out', 'story', 'way', 'Erik', 'Poppe', 'directed', 'moment', 'flawless', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'really', 'feelings', 'grief', 'quite', 'as', 'effectively', 'one', 'Bedroom', 'have', 'complained', ""n't"", 'give', 'many', 'answers', ""n't"", 'point', 'story', ""n't"", 'story', 'what', 'happened', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'purgatory', 'state', 'what', 'when', 'try', 'move', ""on'.The"", 'entire', 'cast', 'stunning', 'here', 'Pal', 'Sverre', 'Valheim', 'Hagen', 'Trine', 'Dyrholm', 'Ellen', 'Dorrit', 'Petersen', 'are', 'exceptionally', 'effective', 'film', 'Dyrholm', 'difficult', 'task', 'unearthing', 'character', 'pain', 'fury', 'going', 'overboard', 'feeling', 'caricature', 'marvelously', 'final', 'confrontation', 'oppressor', 'sorts', 'stunning', 'splice', 'film', 'acting.Soft', 'intimate', 'yet', 'packing', 'serious', 'punch', 'Troubled', 'Water', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'experience']",Troubled Water

I am hard pressed to find higher production values in any other movie I've seen.  The acting, directing, editing, & cinematography are all superlative.  And let's not forget the musical score, from delicate strains of orchestral music to an incredible duo of organ and cello.  The English title of the film seems to derive from a brief organ rendition of Simon & Garfunkle's Bridge Over Trouble Waters, about a quarter way into the move, though I'm not sure if the Norwegian title, De Usynlige, translates thus.  On top of all this, I found the characters to be so real, it's easy to feel for them all, to fall in love with them and yearn for their future.  My only constructive criticism lies with the ending of the story, slightly muddled perhaps.  Was redemption accomplished or only partially? I'm not exactly sure what the movie is telling me at the end (I welcome other reviewers' comments here).  One note of caution, the subject matter deals with the abduction and death of a child, and though handled with great skill in the filmmakers' hands, it is rather brutal nonetheless.

1286152,AN9J46667D80O,B002RZARX6,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[27, 31]","(special thanks to Film Movement for providing me a screener!)Troubled Water is a masterpiece of sad, vaguely depressing, film making where in the end there's no real uplifting message and not a lot of resolution and very few answers. Will it surprise you if I tell you it's a Scandinavian movie?The movie tells the tale of Jan Thomas Hansen, recently released from prison after being convicted of the murder of a young boy. He's always maintained his innocence and blamed a cohort, of whom we see basically nothing.Out of prison he gets a job working as an organist at a church. He's quite good and starts a shy, tentative relationship with Anna, the church priest. He also becomes quite fond of her young son, Jens and starts spending time around him...Meanwhile, Agnes, the mother of the murdered boy, has a parallel story where we see her and her husband and two adopted daughters getting ready to move to Denmark. She's on what appears to be a school field trip to a church and while there notices a suspiciously familiar organist.Soon all her memories of the events surrounding the death of her child come up to the front of her mind (""I can't drink hot chocolate anymore,"" she confesses at one point, remembering that she'd been buying hot chocolate for her son when the boy was taken). Initially she just notices the man, makes some vague platitudes about him and wants to move on, but quickly becomes obsessed, especially once she seems him hanging around a young boy...The movie is about several things. It's about crime and punishment. It's about guilt and how it can consume you from within. It's about a lonely woman and a shy man finding each other. It's about shattered parents trying to move on.It's also about forgiveness, and how you should forgive people who have wronged you not for their sake, but for your own, so that you can move on with your life.It's also a movie that is, at times, quite literally soaked in symbolism. Baptism, rivers, swimming pools and all things wet play a huge role in the film (ironically as I type that, I'm being spattered with water from a leak in the roof).Certain plot elements of the movie were predictable, but the events that followed after took some directions I didn't expect, and at no point did the film feel forced or unreal. It pulls at the heartstrings, true, but it earns those pulls and does not get them through cheap manipulation, and that's a mark of a good film.== SHORT SUBJECT ==This month's short subject is The Kolaborator, a jolly romp through recent Serbian/Bosnian history. It centers around Goran, a soccer player who winds up being on a Serbian death squad, traveling the countryside, helping to murder innocent civilians, including children. As he goes about his missions he eventually runs into the soccer coach and things get a little tense.The movie is nicely filmed, though the washed out colors in the murder scenes are a bit schmaltzy.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 2]","TROUBLED WATER (a reference to the song ""Like A Bridge Over Troubled Water"") is the story of a creepy Norwegian boy who kidnapped a little kid. As we learn in flashbacks, the child died while in the custody of this weird person.Flashing forward quite a few years, the young man is released from prison, his time served. He gets a job as an organist at a nearby church which job also provides him a place to stay. He begins a relationship with the priest, a pretty young single mother who has a son just like the child this guy kidnapped and murdered.In very brilliantly filmed flashback sequences, somewhat likeVantage Point, the mother of the murdered child recognizes the young man and begins shadowing him - though it is cleverly hidden the first time around. She couldn't believe it was the murderer at first because she had not known of his release.The impossible, silly ending might just leave you laughing and I won't spoil it. What I will address: the quality here is quite good, the acting powerful enough though I'll never quite understand those weird European attitudes. Case in point is the law itself: what sort of country lets a child murderer out of jail after a few years served? It is understood they couldn't prove the murder of the little boy, only that he was kidnapped and never seen again - yet here they had the perpetrator.

For this I cannot emphathise with the organist and it little matters he was being egged on. Why was he keeping such bad company in the first place ? The antagonists were not 12-13 yr old bullies or wierdly experimental  kids, too young in  judgement to sense the risks. No,  they looked at least 17yrs maybe 18yrs at the time. It is very disturbing to try to imagine just what KIND of mental/ physical/abuse did they had in mind "" Go ahead do something!!"" his friend urges,  obviously with dark expectations. The little boy was panicked enough to run straight over the embankment. But not before telling  them he knew them, which was probably the only reason the organist baulked.So they get done for manslaughter. But were they nonces in training ??!!  Nipped in the bud?  Then sorry,  all that self righteous redemption I -been -saved by playing the organ doesn't hack it. Seems like sublimation to me.  Since he hasn't atoned with enough humility to treat the other little boy with kindness , at first , or do more than mope when he confronts the father. This after long enough in jail to brood on it all. This film was full of horrid premises and he didn't deserve to get laid by that pastor either,  who was so full of pure in soul. He should have become active in community service to convince me not lingering in the shelter of the church becoming .....ugh....healed.The church talks of the innocence of lambs.

Although these two actors stood out because of their main roles, all actors in this superb movie were outstanding. The director Erik Poppe drew the best out of his players by focusing on what is important: people and relationships. There was no need for explosive pyrotechnics or dramatic car chases in TROUBLED WATERS, for the very real and human struggles of the characters were gripping and sensitively handled with great compassion for human suffering of all kinds.

The simple reason is that very few movies are as good as this one. This is definitely not one of those sad Hollywood monstrosities that aim to prevent you from having a single thought by any means possible. This film does not attempt to benumb the spectators by an endless assault of noises, colors, flashes, explosions, colorful images, etc. It actually leaves the viewers some space to think, analyze, and simply to exist. Troubled Water does not attempt to rob me of my humanity and my human agency, unlike the stupid Hollywood productions.This is the kind of film that works through powerful acting and great directing. There are no cheap thrills in Troubled Water. No special effects, no monsters or vampires, no explosions, 3D effects, unrealistic car chases, etc. There is just life, human existence, normal people trying to figure out important stuff.Instead of silicone-inflated cyborg-like individuals who pass for actors in Hollywood, this film has actors who actually look like real, normal people. We are so used to the assembly-line faces and bodies of Hollywood characters, that the actors in Troubled Water look refreshingly attractive. As attractive as only real human beings can be. And these actors even know how to act.I'm not going to retell the plot of the movie here. Because great art is not about the plot. The story is never as important as the artistic means employed to transmit it.

1286160,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B002RZARX6,Paul Allaer,"[1, 1]","""Troubled Water"" (116 min,; originally released in 2008) is another recent (2010) release in the excellent and on-going series of Film Movement DVDs. This movie out of Norway brings the story of a guy recently released from prison after having done time for a child kdnapping that had ended in the child's death (but did he really commit the crime?). Now going under his middle name Thomas, he finds a position as an organist in a church, and before we know it, he falls for Anna, the pastor who has a 6 yr. old boy, Jens. THings are going well for Thomas, Anna and Jens. Then one day Thomas leaves Jens alone for a few minutes to retrieve something from the class room and when Thomas returns, Jens has disappeared... This event comes about half-way in the movie and from that moment on we see most of the movie again, from another character's perspective, and it all comes together in the last 15 min. of the movie.I thought the movie was riveting from start to finish. If there was one aspect that I didn't quite like that much, it is that quite a few scenes play out in very poorly lit settings for some reason, making it at time hard to even see what is happening. That aside, the performances in the movie, including in particular Pl Sverre Valheim Hagen as Thomas, are outstanding. Also noteworthy is the critical role that music is given in the movie. Several scenes feature extensive and massive church organ-playing, just beautiful. As an aside, I cannot emphasize enough how highly I think of the Film Movement releases. I've now seen maybe 10 or so, and haven't had a single bad experience yet. Meanwhile ""Troubled Water"" is highly recommended!",4,4.5 stars...

1286161,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002RZARX6,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","DeUsynlige (Troubled Water) (Erik Poppe, 2008)Troubled Water is a very pretty, very well-acted, quite compelling movie that has just one flaw. Unfortunately, that flaw is a fatal one indeed, and if you notice it, it is liable to poison the entire movie for you. It's not a spoiler&#8212;the movie goes into this territory pretty early on&#8212;but since it is the kind of thing that is likely to poison the entire film, I will mark it as a spoiler when we get there (the third paragraph of this review), and if you are so inclined and have not seen the movie, you should probably stop reading there. I'll tell you right now it's not a recommend, though&#8212;even given this fatal flaw&#8212;only by the barest of margins; the movie's strong points are almost enough to overcome this. Given how well the movie has been received, either they do overcome it for many people, or that same &#8220;many people&#8221; just don't recognize that the flaw exists; to be fair, you have to be in a certain position in your life to recognize it. But I'm getting ahead of myself.Jan Thomas (Max Manus: Man of War's Pal Sverre Valhein Hagen) has recently been paroled from prison. He was sent there for killing a child, and since his arrest he has maintained that the child's death was an accident. He finds himself a job as the organist at a church headed by Anna (King of Devil's Island's Ellen Dorrit Peterson), who has a son, Jens (Into the Dark's Fredrik Grondahl in his screen debut) about the same age as Isak (Jon Vagenes Erikson), the boy who died all those years (ten? fifteen?) ago. Jan Thomas is initially reluctant to interact with Jens, but eventually he and Anna's attraction for one another wins out, and Jan Thomas and Jens start bonding. All goes smoothly until Agnes (Festen's Trine Dyrholm), Isak's mother, discovers Jan Thomas is out of prison and begins stalking him, trying to make him admit to a murder he continues to assert never occurred.As promised, here's the big SPOILER ALERT warning. Here's the main thing that blew the movie for me: if a child dies on your watch, and it doesn't matter one bit if that death was intentional or not, there is no way in ever-living hell that you are going to treat another child on your watch with the casual air with which Jan Thomas treats Jens once the two of them start becoming friends. Which would normally be a minor annoyance, but that casuality is the mechanism upon which the entire second half of the movie turns; Harald Rosenlow-Eeg (Hawaii, Oslo)'s script turns on this device, pushing it into a far more important place than it should have. Thus, without this particularly choice piece of stupidity... we wouldn't have a movie. There are other, far more minor, pieces of silliness that do rate as minor annoyances in comparison (why the hell, in the flashback scenes, is Agnes pushing Isak, who's supposedly four and definitely very large for his age, around in a stroller? And even if you can justify that, why a stroller that's at least two sizes too small for him? It becomes obvious in the flashbacks pertaining to his death that the boy is perfectly capable of walking on his own), but none of them achieve the magnitude, or the ineptitude, of this one. If you can get past that, it's quite a nice little film, perhaps a little Lifetine Original Movie-esque in the romance angles (both the germination of the relationship between Jan Thomas and Anna and the strained relationship between Agnes and her husband, whose marriage is on the verge of disintegration throughout the film), but compelling enough for all that. If Rosenlow-Eeg had treated the relationship between Jan Thomas and Jens with the intelligence it deserved, and then by default not attempted to make this into the thriller it never becomes, it would have been a very different and, I think, much more compelling film. **",2,The entire movie turns on an impossibility.,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,3857,"['DeUsynlige', 'Troubled', 'Water', 'Erik', 'Poppe', '2008', 'Troubled', 'Water', 'very', 'pretty', 'very', 'well-acted', 'quite', 'compelling', 'movie', 'just', 'one', 'flaw', 'Unfortunately', 'flaw', 'fatal', 'one', 'indeed', 'notice', 'liable', 'poison', 'entire', 'movie', 'not', 'spoiler', '8212', 'movie', 'territory', 'pretty', 'early', '8212', 'kind', 'thing', 'likely', 'poison', 'entire', 'film', 'will', 'mark', 'spoiler', 'when', 'get', 'there', 'third', 'paragraph', 'review', 'are', 'so', 'inclined', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'should', 'probably', 'stop', 'reading', 'there', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'right', 'now', 'not', 'recommend', '8212', 'even', 'given', 'fatal', 'flaw', '8212', 'only', 'barest', 'margins', 'movie', 'strong', 'points', 'are', 'almost', 'enough', 'overcome', 'Given', 'how', 'well', 'movie', 'been', 'received', 'either', 'do', 'overcome', 'many', 'people', 'same', '8220', 'many', 'people', '8221', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'flaw', 'be', 'fair', 'have', 'be', 'certain', 'position', 'life', 'recognize', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'myself.Jan', 'Thomas', 'Max', 'Manus', 'Man', 'War', 'Pal', 'Sverre', 'Valhein', 'Hagen', 'recently', 'been', 'paroled', 'prison', 'was', 'sent', 'there', 'killing', 'child', 'arrest', 'maintained', 'child', 'death', 'was', 'accident', 'job', 'organist', 'church', 'headed', 'Anna', 'King', 'Devil', 'Island', 'Ellen', 'Dorrit', 'Peterson', 'who', 'son', 'Jens', 'Into', 'Dark', 'Fredrik', 'Grondahl', 'screen', 'debut', 'same', 'age', 'Isak', 'Jon', 'Vagenes', 'Erikson', 'boy', 'who', 'died', 'years', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'ago', 'Jan', 'Thomas', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'interact', 'Jens', 'eventually', 'Anna', 'attraction', 'one', 'out', 'Jan', 'Thomas', 'Jens', 'start', 'bonding', 'smoothly', 'Agnes', 'Festen', 'Trine', 'Dyrholm', 'Isak', 'mother', 'discovers', 'Jan', 'Thomas', 'prison', 'stalking', 'trying', 'make', 'admit', 'murder', 'assert', 'never', 'promised', 'here', 'big', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'warning', 'Here', 'main', 'thing', 'blew', 'movie', 'child', 'watch', ""n't"", 'matter', 'one', 'bit', 'death', 'was', 'intentional', 'not', 'way', 'ever-living', 'hell', 'are', 'going', 'treat', 'child', 'watch', 'casual', 'air', 'Jan', 'Thomas', 'Jens', 'once', 'two', 'start', 'becoming', 'friends', 'Which', 'would', 'normally', 'be', 'minor', 'annoyance', 'casuality', 'mechanism', 'entire', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'Harald', 'Rosenlow-Eeg', 'Hawaii', 'Oslo', 'script', 'device', 'pushing', 'far', 'more', 'important', 'place', 'should', 'have', 'Thus', 'particularly', 'choice', 'piece', 'stupidity', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'are', 'other', 'far', 'more', 'minor', 'pieces', 'silliness', 'do', 'rate', 'minor', 'annoyances', 'comparison', 'why', 'hell', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'Agnes', 'pushing', 'Isak', 'who', 'supposedly', 'four', 'definitely', 'very', 'large', 'age', 'stroller', 'even', 'can', 'justify', 'why', 'stroller', 'least', 'two', 'sizes', 'too', 'small', 'obvious', 'flashbacks', 'pertaining', 'death', 'boy', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'walking', 'own', 'none', 'achieve', 'magnitude', 'ineptitude', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'quite', 'nice', 'little', 'film', 'perhaps', 'little', 'Lifetine', 'Original', 'Movie-esque', 'romance', 'angles', 'germination', 'relationship', 'Jan', 'Thomas', 'Anna', 'strained', 'relationship', 'Agnes', 'husband', 'marriage', 'verge', 'disintegration', 'film', 'compelling', 'enough', 'Rosenlow-Eeg', 'had', 'treated', 'relationship', 'Jan', 'Thomas', 'Jens', 'intelligence', 'deserved', 'then', 'default', 'not', 'attempted', 'make', 'thriller', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'different', 'think', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'film', '**']",Troubled Water
