496184,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B00000EZXC,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[17, 18]","Writer-director Paul Schrader delivers his most satisfying film for me.  He is even better known for his work when he solely screenwriters, such as for his unsurpassed &quot;Taxi Driver,&quot; directed by his frequent collaborator, Marty Scorsese. For his own solo film though, this is my favorite. Schrader's film work is frequently compared to the late Robert Bresson's films.  However, Bresson has always been a little too painterly for me.  Schrader is painterly enough and to make it any more so evokes that dreaded word in film: slow.  I frankly prefer this film to the Bresson films I've seen, which makes me a film heretic I realize.  Urban alienation is at the core of this film, which is true of all Schrader's work, and Willem Dafoe plays a nocturnal drug dealer who doesn't get much sleep (hence the title), probably because his dreams remain so elusive from his grasp, as a metaphor for the overall film.  Two women present the immediate conflict in the film. Susan Sarandon plays a drug dealer who Dafoe works for and she tells him that they both need to get out of dealing. She plans to open a legitimate cosmetics business and seems capable of following through on the idea. She is the most in control of her life of the three main characters. Dana Delany plays Dafoe's former lover, who doesn't want anything to do with him because they were substance abusers together in the past.  Although he's clean now, he still deals. But is her character as squeaky clean as she now proclaims to be?  Dafoe needs to figure that out. Further tension comes about from the eroticism between Dafoe and Delany plus the growing potential for eroticism between Dafoe and Sarandon. Dafoe is absolutely wonderful in this film and becomes a major romantic and erotic dream figure for the viewer regardless of what the viewer thinks of him vis a vis the two women.",5,Willem Dafoe: Major Romantic &amp; Erotic Dream Figure,990316800,"05 20, 2001",2001,1860,"['Writer-director', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'most', 'satisfying', 'film', 'even', 'better', 'known', 'work', 'when', 'solely', 'screenwriters', 'such', 'unsurpassed', 'quot', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'quot', 'directed', 'frequent', 'collaborator', 'Marty', 'Scorsese', 'own', 'solo', 'film', 'favorite', 'Schrader', 'film', 'work', 'frequently', 'compared', 'late', 'Robert', 'Bresson', 'films', 'However', 'Bresson', 'always', 'been', 'little', 'too', 'painterly', 'Schrader', 'painterly', 'enough', 'make', 'more', 'so', 'dreaded', 'word', 'film', 'slow', 'frankly', 'prefer', 'film', 'Bresson', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'heretic', 'realize', 'Urban', 'alienation', 'core', 'film', 'true', 'Schrader', 'work', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'nocturnal', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'sleep', 'hence', 'title', 'probably', 'dreams', 'remain', 'so', 'elusive', 'grasp', 'metaphor', 'overall', 'film', 'Two', 'women', 'present', 'immediate', 'conflict', 'film', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'Dafoe', 'need', 'get', 'dealing', 'open', 'legitimate', 'cosmetics', 'business', 'capable', 'following', 'idea', 'most', 'control', 'life', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'Dafoe', 'former', 'lover', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'were', 'substance', 'abusers', 'together', 'past', 'clean', 'now', 'still', 'character', 'squeaky', 'clean', 'now', 'be', 'Dafoe', 'figure', 'out', 'Further', 'tension', 'eroticism', 'Dafoe', 'Delany', 'growing', 'potential', 'eroticism', 'Dafoe', 'Sarandon', 'Dafoe', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'film', 'major', 'romantic', 'erotic', 'dream', 'figure', 'viewer', 'regardless', 'what', 'viewer', 'thinks', 'vis', 'vis', 'two', 'women']",N/A

He worries about his future, but he is firmly enmeshed in a lifestyle from which escape does not seem like a realistic option.  A bit of hope creeps back into his life when he encounters an old flame (Dana Delany) from his days as a user and the possibility of rekindled romance becomes his lifeline.  This is a very low-key film for most of its length, but its climactic explosion of violence provides a jarring change of pace that plays as if writer/director Paul Schrader couldn't figure out how to end the film.  Delany's character is rather off-handedly changed from a figure with real dramatic purpose to a mere plot point that sets up the justification for a bloodbath.

John works dispassionately during the night and without anything to believe in, visits psychics, to try to give meaning to the life he sees changing as Ann trys to go legit with a cosmetics business.  Not having saved much and not having another trade, John senses a climax coming; he doesn't know in what form it will appear, but he's not backing away from it.Women associated with the main drug buying client are dying, apparent suicides and when the last one has a very personal connection to John (Dana Delany - very well acted although the character isn't developed sufficiently), it sets up the violent climax to the movie.  John almost welcomes the outcome as his dispair worsens and jail or death wouldn't be an unwelcome change.The direction is uniquely Shrader.  The characters are very well actualized (with the noted excption above).  The performances are amazing which should come as no surprise considering the professional abilities of all.  The mood remains constant while the soundtrack suits the movie without appealing excessively to only one generation as many do.  The visuals as shown in the subdued and grainy colors enhance the overall impact this movie has.  This movie is more about a life style than plot driven.  The characters are all in denial about the changes in the world to which they need to adapt if they want to survive.  It addresses survivorship of those who didn't plan the next phase of their life very well, have been getting by on their wits, but are finding a changing world no longer respects the decreasingly marketable skills those wits once represented.While not an uplifting movie, it stays with you and is definitely recommended.",4,Fascinating Nocturnal Urban Desperation,1011139200,"01 16, 2002",2002,1819,"['Willem', 'Dafoe', 'John', 'reformed', 'junky', 'conscience', 'delivering', 'drugs', 'upscale', 'dealer', 'played', 'superbly', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Ann', 'John', 'dispassionately', 'night', 'anything', 'believe', 'visits', 'psychics', 'try', 'give', 'meaning', 'life', 'changing', 'Ann', 'trys', 'go', 'legit', 'cosmetics', 'business', 'Not', 'having', 'saved', 'much', 'not', 'having', 'trade', 'John', 'climax', 'coming', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'form', 'will', 'appear', 'not', 'backing', 'away', 'it.Women', 'associated', 'main', 'drug', 'buying', 'client', 'are', 'dying', 'apparent', 'suicides', 'when', 'last', 'one', 'very', 'personal', 'connection', 'John', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'character', ""n't"", 'developed', 'sufficiently', 'up', 'violent', 'climax', 'movie', 'John', 'almost', 'outcome', 'dispair', 'worsens', 'jail', 'death', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'unwelcome', 'change.The', 'direction', 'uniquely', 'Shrader', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'actualized', 'noted', 'excption', 'performances', 'are', 'amazing', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'considering', 'professional', 'abilities', 'mood', 'constant', 'soundtrack', 'suits', 'movie', 'appealing', 'excessively', 'only', 'one', 'generation', 'many', 'do', 'visuals', 'shown', 'subdued', 'grainy', 'colors', 'enhance', 'overall', 'impact', 'movie', 'movie', 'more', 'life', 'style', 'plot', 'driven', 'characters', 'are', 'denial', 'changes', 'world', 'need', 'adapt', 'want', 'survive', 'survivorship', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'plan', 'next', 'phase', 'life', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'getting', 'wits', 'are', 'finding', 'changing', 'world', 'no', 'longer', 'decreasingly', 'marketable', 'skills', 'wits', 'once', 'not', 'uplifting', 'movie', 'definitely', 'recommended']",N/A
496189,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00000EZXC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","The irony is that while an obvious case can be made that the best way to appreciate Paul Schrader's 1992 drama ""Light Sleeper"" is to have seen the previous two entries in his ""nocturnal alienation"" trilogy, ""Taxi Driver"" and ""American Gigolo,"" those comparisons are the Achilles heel for the film as well.  The commonalities between the angry young Travis Bickle, the narcissistic Julian Kay, and Willem Dafoe's John LeTour are obvious since they are loners with a variety of night jobs.  But what is more important is the way Schrader's archetypal hero has progressed over the course of these three films to the point where this last version is able to take stock of his life and realize he is actually looking forward to something in his life.This is rather difficult for LaTour because the omnipresent fact of this film is that his past is close behind.  Although he has stopped doing drugs, he does deliveries for his boss lady, Ann (Susan Sarandon), who keeps threatening to go legit and do cosmetics rather than sell drugs.  The other person delivering drugs to Ann's upscale clientele is Robert (David Clennon), and he is interested in changing careers too.  So far the change is just all talk but LaTour starts wondering about his own future and does not see much of one.  When he is not ""working"" he spends his time filling up stacks of composition books while drinking wine.  He has tried being an actor and dreams of being a musician, but apparently has not noticed that he is actually a writer.The catalyst for change becomes a couple of chance encounters with his old girl friend, Marianne (Dana Delany), who does not really want to remember the good times they shared when they were both addicts.  She is back in town to sit by the bedside of her dying mother at a local hospital and LaTour becomes captivated by the idea that she represents the road not taken and an opportunity for him to change his life.  But even though he is able to get back into her bed and have a moment of sheer happiness, Marianne cannot see him as a good future.  For her, he is only a reminder of a bad past, and although his heart and motives are pure he is a slippery slope for her despite his best intentions.The problem is that at the moment of crisis it is hard not to see Schrader's film as returning to territory quite similar to the final reel of ""Taxi Driver.""  I liked the optimistic revelations of LaTour's final speech in the film, but how we get from the film's low point to the prospect of a happy ending somewhere down the road is missing the necessary causal connections to make the conclusion truly fulfilling.  Fortunately the performances cover the narrative gaps as Schrader spins his little morality play about the decline and fall of the drug culture.  There is never really a point where Dafoe's character is a bad person and the same can be said for Sarandon's as well, while it is Delany whose character jumps the rails when she is being asked to anchor another person's life.  ""Light Sleeper"" is the weakest part of this faux trilogy, but it has value both as that last act and on its own terms.",4,Paul Schrader grows into being something of an optimist,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,3114,"['irony', 'obvious', 'case', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'best', 'way', 'appreciate', 'Paul', 'Schrader', '1992', 'drama', 'Light', 'Sleeper', 'have', 'seen', 'previous', 'two', 'entries', 'nocturnal', 'alienation', 'trilogy', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'American', 'Gigolo', 'comparisons', 'are', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'commonalities', 'angry', 'young', 'Travis', 'Bickle', 'narcissistic', 'Julian', 'Kay', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'John', 'LeTour', 'are', 'obvious', 'are', 'loners', 'variety', 'night', 'jobs', 'what', 'more', 'important', 'way', 'Schrader', 'archetypal', 'hero', 'progressed', 'course', 'three', 'films', 'point', 'where', 'last', 'version', 'able', 'take', 'stock', 'life', 'realize', 'actually', 'looking', 'forward', 'something', 'life.This', 'rather', 'difficult', 'LaTour', 'omnipresent', 'fact', 'film', 'past', 'close', 'stopped', 'doing', 'drugs', 'deliveries', 'boss', 'lady', 'Ann', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'threatening', 'go', 'legit', 'do', 'cosmetics', 'rather', 'sell', 'drugs', 'other', 'person', 'delivering', 'drugs', 'Ann', 'upscale', 'clientele', 'Robert', 'David', 'Clennon', 'interested', 'changing', 'careers', 'too', 'So', 'far', 'change', 'just', 'talk', 'LaTour', 'wondering', 'own', 'future', 'not', 'see', 'much', 'one', 'When', 'not', 'working', 'time', 'filling', 'up', 'stacks', 'composition', 'books', 'drinking', 'wine', 'tried', 'being', 'actor', 'dreams', 'being', 'musician', 'apparently', 'not', 'noticed', 'actually', 'writer.The', 'catalyst', 'change', 'couple', 'chance', 'encounters', 'old', 'girl', 'friend', 'Marianne', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'who', 'not', 'really', 'want', 'remember', 'good', 'times', 'shared', 'when', 'were', 'addicts', 'back', 'town', 'sit', 'bedside', 'dying', 'mother', 'local', 'hospital', 'LaTour', 'becomes', 'captivated', 'idea', 'road', 'not', 'taken', 'opportunity', 'change', 'life', 'even', 'able', 'get', 'back', 'bed', 'have', 'moment', 'sheer', 'happiness', 'Marianne', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'good', 'future', 'only', 'reminder', 'bad', 'past', 'heart', 'motives', 'are', 'pure', 'slippery', 'slope', 'best', 'intentions.The', 'problem', 'moment', 'crisis', 'hard', 'not', 'see', 'Schrader', 'film', 'returning', 'territory', 'quite', 'similar', 'final', 'reel', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'liked', 'optimistic', 'revelations', 'LaTour', 'final', 'speech', 'film', 'how', 'get', 'film', 'low', 'point', 'prospect', 'happy', 'ending', 'somewhere', 'road', 'missing', 'necessary', 'causal', 'connections', 'make', 'conclusion', 'truly', 'fulfilling', 'Fortunately', 'performances', 'cover', 'narrative', 'gaps', 'Schrader', 'little', 'morality', 'play', 'decline', 'fall', 'drug', 'culture', 'never', 'really', 'point', 'where', 'Dafoe', 'character', 'bad', 'person', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Sarandon', 'as', 'well', 'Delany', 'character', 'rails', 'when', 'being', 'asked', 'anchor', 'person', 'life', 'Light', 'Sleeper', 'weakest', 'part', 'faux', 'trilogy', 'value', 'last', 'act', 'own', 'terms']",N/A

Though I'm a Schrader fan and film buff, I was never aware that this ""Trilogy"" existed and enjoyed this film on its own. This film is not Taxi Driver, one of the greatest American films ever made, but it also does not carry the over-bearing weight of that film, and can be ""enjoyed"", with an anti-hero which we can more readily identify. The style is minimalist with great visual touches and choices by Schrader (with some moments that are quiet but extremely revealing), fun dialogue and interesting characters. The subtext dealing with aging drug dealer DeFoe's insomniac character LaTour, confronting his ""lost dreams"" as the ""garbage"" of his past piles up (set against a New York waste haulers' strike) is compelling and strong thematically. Anybody over 30 who's given a moments thought to their life's choices and where they're going can identify. Sarandon and Delaney are in top form. Yes, the ending is a bit forced with some over-violence and a bit of a leap in logic (the relationship between DeFoe and Sarandan is not established well enough to warrant his expressions at the end).
