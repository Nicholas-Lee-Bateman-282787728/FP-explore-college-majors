1152407,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B001675YOS,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Don't let the fact that this film was produced for the Sci-Fi Channel keep you from giving Organizm (also known as Living Hell) a try because it's a pretty darn good movie.  While it is somewhat derivative of some films that have come before, it sort of hearkens back to the good old monster movies of the 1950s - only now, the scientist trying to figure out how to save the world from the horrors of the colossal beast is a woman rather than a man.Back in 1959, ten-year-old Frank Sears' kooky mother conveyed a very important message to her son, going so far as to carve that message into the palms of his hands in what would be the final moments of her life.  33 years later, Frank, now a biology teacher in New Jersey, drives all the way to Fort Lambert in an effort to convey that message to those in charge.  Having learned that the fort was being torn down, he feels duty-bound to warn them not to disturb whatever is hidden in a secret area of the camp.  Naturally, the military folks check the area out, gain access to the secret vault, and seriously disturb the thing they discover there.  Before you can say Jack Sprat, this Organizm wakes up and starts spreading - very quickly.  It has these octopus-like appendages that spread everywhere like wildfire, destroy anything - and anyone - it comes in contact with.  The military evacuates to a local town and sets up a command center.  None of their weapons are of any use against the rapidly growing creature, but those in the chain of command pursue a contain and destroy strategy against it.  Meanwhile, Specialist Carrie Freeborn (Erica Leerhsen), whose job it is to dispose of hazardous materials, defies orders and teams up with Frank, convinced he is somehow the key to understanding and thereby stopping the monster.Admittedly Organizm doesn't deviate far from the standard science vs. man-made monster modus operandi - but that's okay.  It gives the film a sort of old school feel about it.  Of course, there's nothing old school about the special effects, which feature a great deal of CGI animation.  Without a big budget, the filmmakers couldn't afford to make every scene ultra-realistic, but I think Organizm's special effects work quit well for the most part.Erica Leerhsen is building a pretty decent horror resume for herself (some may remember her from Wrong Turn 2), and I think she turned in an excellent performance in this film.  Johnathon Schaech acquits himself quite nicely, as well, but he could never have carried this film on his own.  I read somewhere that the film was shot in a mere 20 days (at a budget of four and a half million dollars), if that's true, then I'm even more impressed with what I saw here.  The cast and crew really came together as a team and turned out a film they can be proud of (in my opinion, anyway).  Organizm could easily have turned into a total cheesefest, but the strong cast and action-packed storyline never let that happen.  I don't care how outlandish a film is, as long as I find it entertaining - and this one took me for a pretty entertaining ride.",4,"This thing reaches out and grabs you -- and the movie's pretty good, too",1224374400,"10 19, 2008",2008,3076,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'keep', 'giving', 'Organizm', 'also', 'known', 'Living', 'Hell', 'try', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'derivative', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'sort', 'hearkens', 'back', 'good', 'old', 'monster', 'movies', '1950s', 'only', 'now', 'scientist', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'save', 'world', 'horrors', 'colossal', 'beast', 'woman', 'rather', 'man.Back', '1959', 'ten-year-old', 'Frank', 'Sears', 'kooky', 'mother', 'conveyed', 'very', 'important', 'message', 'son', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'carve', 'message', 'palms', 'hands', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'moments', 'life', '33', 'years', 'later', 'Frank', 'now', 'biology', 'teacher', 'New', 'Jersey', 'way', 'Fort', 'Lambert', 'effort', 'convey', 'message', 'charge', 'Having', 'learned', 'fort', 'was', 'being', 'torn', 'down', 'duty-bound', 'warn', 'not', 'disturb', 'hidden', 'secret', 'area', 'camp', 'Naturally', 'military', 'folks', 'check', 'area', 'out', 'gain', 'access', 'secret', 'vault', 'seriously', 'disturb', 'thing', 'discover', 'there', 'can', 'say', 'Jack', 'Sprat', 'Organizm', 'up', 'spreading', 'very', 'quickly', 'octopus-like', 'appendages', 'spread', 'everywhere', 'wildfire', 'destroy', 'anything', 'anyone', 'contact', 'military', 'evacuates', 'local', 'town', 'up', 'command', 'center', 'None', 'weapons', 'are', 'use', 'rapidly', 'growing', 'creature', 'chain', 'command', 'pursue', 'contain', 'destroy', 'strategy', 'Meanwhile', 'Specialist', 'Carrie', 'Freeborn', 'Erica', 'Leerhsen', 'job', 'dispose', 'hazardous', 'materials', 'defies', 'orders', 'teams', 'up', 'Frank', 'convinced', 'somehow', 'key', 'understanding', 'thereby', 'stopping', 'monster.Admittedly', 'Organizm', ""n't"", 'deviate', 'far', 'standard', 'science', 'vs.', 'man-made', 'monster', 'modus', 'operandi', 'okay', 'film', 'sort', 'old', 'school', 'feel', 'course', 'nothing', 'old', 'school', 'special', 'effects', 'feature', 'great', 'deal', 'CGI', 'animation', 'big', 'budget', 'filmmakers', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'make', 'scene', 'ultra-realistic', 'think', 'Organizm', 'special', 'effects', 'work', 'quit', 'well', 'most', 'part.Erica', 'Leerhsen', 'building', 'pretty', 'decent', 'horror', 'resume', 'herself', 'may', 'remember', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '2', 'think', 'turned', 'excellent', 'performance', 'film', 'Johnathon', 'Schaech', 'quite', 'nicely', 'well', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'carried', 'film', 'own', 'read', 'somewhere', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'mere', '20', 'days', 'budget', 'four', 'half', 'million', 'dollars', 'true', 'then', ""'m"", 'even', 'more', 'impressed', 'what', 'saw', 'here', 'cast', 'crew', 'really', 'came', 'together', 'team', 'turned', 'out', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'proud', 'opinion', 'anyway', 'Organizm', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'turned', 'total', 'cheesefest', 'strong', 'cast', 'action-packed', 'storyline', 'never', 'let', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'outlandish', 'film', 'as', 'long', 'find', 'entertaining', 'one', 'took', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'ride']",Organizm

Bad CGI usually doesn't bother me because its par for the course in low budget movies, but it is just so bad that it deterred me from fully enjoying the movie. And another problem is that the movie seemed to have some sort of budget because everything else about it was pretty good, so the CGI issue really is unforgivable.

1152411,AAW58LG72PG7I,B001675YOS,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 1]","ORGANIZM (also titled LIVING HELL) is a throwback to the popular 50s genre of end of the world films in which mankind is doomed due to science gone wild.  Now this sort of thing has been done well since then--THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN and X-FILES come to mind--but here the focus is more on creating a mood of impending despair rather than on FX. The plot is based on an experiment from the 50s in which a Russian scientist created a mutant virus of extreme lethality and capable of exponential growth. The virus kills him and his superiors bury him and the virus in the bowels of a military base that might have also accommodated Roswell. Fifty years later, his son appears and his presence causes an unsuspecting colonel to authorize the opening of the crypt, thus releasing the virus.  The virus is capable of growing at high speed and much of the film is spent showing how little the military can do to halt its spread.  ORGANIZM is truly a film of a moody despair.  As one watches how victims are literally enveloped in a writhing mass of ubiquitous pointed stems, one feels that the scene is reminiscent of a plunge into some gooey mess, sort of like a scene from FANTASTIC VOYAGE. There are no standout scenes of acting, scripting, or even FX. What one takes away from ORGANIZM is the unsettling feeling that accompanies lying for slightly too long in a prickly bramble bush looking for an errant ball.",3,A Mildly Successful Rehash of Various End of Days Films,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",2009,1404,"['ORGANIZM', 'also', 'titled', 'LIVING', 'HELL', 'throwback', 'popular', '50s', 'genre', 'end', 'world', 'films', 'mankind', 'doomed', 'due', 'science', 'gone', 'wild', 'Now', 'sort', 'thing', 'been', 'done', 'well', 'then', 'THE', 'ANDROMEDA', 'STRAIN', 'X-FILES', 'come', 'mind', 'here', 'focus', 'more', 'creating', 'mood', 'impending', 'despair', 'rather', 'FX', 'plot', 'based', 'experiment', '50s', 'Russian', 'scientist', 'created', 'mutant', 'virus', 'extreme', 'lethality', 'capable', 'exponential', 'growth', 'virus', 'superiors', 'bury', 'virus', 'bowels', 'military', 'base', 'might', 'have', 'also', 'accommodated', 'Roswell', 'Fifty', 'years', 'later', 'son', 'presence', 'unsuspecting', 'colonel', 'authorize', 'opening', 'crypt', 'thus', 'releasing', 'virus', 'virus', 'capable', 'growing', 'high', 'speed', 'much', 'film', 'spent', 'showing', 'how', 'little', 'military', 'can', 'do', 'halt', 'spread', 'ORGANIZM', 'truly', 'film', 'moody', 'despair', 'one', 'how', 'victims', 'are', 'literally', 'enveloped', 'writhing', 'mass', 'ubiquitous', 'pointed', 'stems', 'one', 'feels', 'scene', 'reminiscent', 'plunge', 'gooey', 'mess', 'sort', 'scene', 'FANTASTIC', 'VOYAGE', 'are', 'standout', 'scenes', 'acting', 'scripting', 'even', 'FX', 'What', 'one', 'away', 'ORGANIZM', 'unsettling', 'feeling', 'lying', 'slightly', 'too', 'long', 'prickly', 'bramble', 'bush', 'looking', 'errant', 'ball']",Organizm

Many of them feature the army fighting some kind of monster and this one does and the acting is solid and done by decent actors who pull off the monster on the loose story with gusto.  This movie even has a long dead mad scientist who unleashed the creature back in the fifties.It's just a good romp of a movie and if you enjoyed those old movies this is a salute to them except of course in the special effects department.This one has effects of this decade (the early 21st century).The effects look great in this movie and make the film seem as though it was made with  a higher budget.  Just ten years ago a movie of this budget with cgi looked cartoony. This movie doesn't look like that at all in fact it looks pretty good and the monster is a creeping menace straight out of a vintage quartermass movie.

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","This movie has a stupid title.It's obvious that Syfy was ambivalent about it too, as the movie was later released on DVD as Organizm. With a ""z,"" which isn't much better than Living Hell and just makes it look like Syfy doesn't know how to spell ""organism.""But the naming difficulties suit the movie, which is difficult to quantify.  Although there technically is a monster, it's a living cancer.  And if you look at it that way, Living Hell is a manifestation of our worst fears about inheriting our parents' genetic abnormalities. If your dad gets cancer, you could get it too!Frank Sears (Johnathon Schaech) is the child of a terrible legacy; his mother forced him to memorize a message before murdering his adopted father and killing herself. Haunted by the message, Sears panics when he discovers a military base is about to be torn down - the same base alluded to by his mother.  So doing whatever it takes, Frank breaks into the base to warn the Army: DON'T GO IN THE BASEMENT!Which they do.  Of course.Leading the expedition to decommission the base is wife-and-husband team Carrie (Erica Leerhsen) and disabled Glenn (Jason Wiles) Freeborn under the command of Col. Erik Maitland (James McDaniel). Things go south almost instantly as Sears' real father is discovered, a floating corpse in a tank of full of formaldehyde. The organism (or is it organizm?) feeds on energy and instantly grows like a giant, malignant tumor once it is in the military's lights. In the span of a few minutes, the entire base along with Carrie's husband is overrun.The military is in retreat. Their inevitable response is a standard horror movie trope: nuke it from orbit.  Since the creature feeds on energy, a nuclear bomb seems like vitamins, more likely to make the thing bigger and stronger than actually kill it.  But then, the Army isn't interested in listening to half-baked theories about a central nucleus that can be killed with Sears' blood.Yeah, we've seen this before.  In fact, we've seen it inInfected, which was about a similar concept with a similar hero who has a similar bloody solution.It's not great -- there's a squicky blood-bathing scene that cleverly gets fetching Leerhsen naked without making the audience hate her after her husband's recent death - but the film is briskly paced, the monster is interesting, the effects are passable, and Sears' response to his father's legacy is poignant.

1152417,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001675YOS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 10]","Organizm (Richard Jefferies, 2008)When I originally looked this dog up at IMDB, it was sitting there with an 8.2 rating-- one would, were there not a floor on number of votes necessary to enter it, put this in the top 250 films of all time. (Cooler heads have prevailed in the past twenty-four hours, it seems; another sixty-odd votes have dropped it to 4.7.) That's depressing. There are really people who thought it was that good?The plot: An army base is in the process of being decommissioned when a high-school biology teacher, Frank Sears (The Doom Generation's Jonathon Shaech), shows up out of nowhere (having managed to drive from Trenton, New Jersey, to rural New Mexico in thirty-six hours; quite a vehicle he's got there) to give the commander of the operation, Colonel Maitland (NYPD Blue's James McDaniel), a message: whatever's in section 12 vault 3, don't disturb it. Of course, they do, and it's up to Sears and eye-popping, uniform-filling beauty Carrie Freeborn (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Erica Leerhsen) to figure out how to stop the seemingly invincible creature the Army has let loose.Now, before I trash this entirely, I will say that no movie containing Erica Leerhsen, who seems to have set herself up as a slightly dirtier, lower-rent Charlize Theron, is a complete waste of time. Why? Because you get to stare at Erica Leerhsen. It's like watching The Astronaut's Wife just so you can stare at Charlize Theron. There's certainly nothing else to like about The Astronaut's Wife, and there's nothing else to like about Organizm, either; when your film contains, in its first five minutes, both CGI blood and CGI vomit, you have entered a realm in which all movies are a waste of celluloid. The thing of it is that the special effects guys (whose names are going to be so obscure after this I didn't even bother to scroll down and look them up) didn't even bother to line up the effects with the actors; in one memorable (only because we see it multiple times, and once in close-up) scene, a bullet that's supposed to be shot through a person's hand into his head creates a very unconvincing hole about three inches to the left of the person's hand, complete with atmospheric blood spatter. Who knew atmosphere had blood?Jefferies took the director's chair for only the second time in his career; his last film was Blood Tide, the James Earl Jones Greek-Island monster movie from 1982. While Blood Tide is good cheesy fun-- I watch it every year or so just to remind myself how charmingly awful it is-- I didn't really think Jefferies could do any worse. Guess what? He did. *",1,So bad it's almost funny.,1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,2604,"['Organizm', 'Richard', 'Jefferies', '2008', 'When', 'originally', 'looked', 'dog', 'up', 'IMDB', 'was', 'sitting', 'there', '8.2', 'rating', 'one', 'would', 'were', 'there', 'not', 'floor', 'number', 'votes', 'necessary', 'enter', 'put', 'top', '250', 'films', 'time', 'Cooler', 'heads', 'have', 'prevailed', 'past', 'twenty-four', 'hours', 'sixty-odd', 'votes', 'have', 'dropped', '4.7', 'depressing', 'are', 'really', 'people', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'plot', 'army', 'base', 'process', 'being', 'decommissioned', 'when', 'high-school', 'biology', 'teacher', 'Frank', 'Sears', 'Doom', 'Generation', 'Jonathon', 'Shaech', 'up', 'nowhere', 'having', 'managed', 'drive', 'Trenton', 'New', 'Jersey', 'rural', 'New', 'Mexico', 'thirty-six', 'hours', 'quite', 'vehicle', 'got', 'there', 'give', 'commander', 'operation', 'Colonel', 'Maitland', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'James', 'McDaniel', 'message', 'section', '12', 'vault', '3', 'do', ""n't"", 'disturb', 'course', 'do', 'up', 'Sears', 'eye-popping', 'uniform-filling', 'beauty', 'Carrie', 'Freeborn', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Erica', 'Leerhsen', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'stop', 'seemingly', 'invincible', 'creature', 'Army', 'let', 'loose.Now', 'trash', 'entirely', 'will', 'say', 'movie', 'containing', 'Erica', 'Leerhsen', 'who', 'have', 'set', 'up', 'slightly', 'dirtier', 'lower-rent', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'Why', 'get', 'stare', 'Erica', 'Leerhsen', 'watching', 'Astronaut', 'Wife', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'stare', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'else', 'like', 'Astronaut', 'Wife', 'nothing', 'else', 'like', 'Organizm', 'either', 'when', 'film', 'contains', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'CGI', 'blood', 'CGI', 'vomit', 'have', 'entered', 'realm', 'movies', 'are', 'waste', 'celluloid', 'thing', 'special', 'effects', 'guys', 'names', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'so', 'obscure', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'scroll', 'down', 'look', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'line', 'up', 'effects', 'actors', 'one', 'memorable', 'only', 'see', 'multiple', 'times', 'once', 'close-up', 'scene', 'bullet', 'supposed', 'be', 'shot', 'person', 'hand', 'head', 'very', 'unconvincing', 'hole', 'three', 'inches', 'left', 'person', 'hand', 'complete', 'atmospheric', 'blood', 'spatter', 'Who', 'knew', 'atmosphere', 'had', 'blood', 'Jefferies', 'took', 'director', 'chair', 'only', 'second', 'time', 'career', 'last', 'film', 'was', 'Blood', 'Tide', 'James', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Greek-Island', 'monster', 'movie', '1982', 'Blood', 'Tide', 'good', 'cheesy', 'fun', 'watch', 'year', 'so', 'just', 'remind', 'how', 'charmingly', 'awful', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'Jefferies', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'Guess', 'what', 'did', '*']",Organizm

The writer fails to ""humanize"" his dialog in numerous places which cannot help but remove the viewer from the film itself and eliminating whatever ""suspension of disbelief"" that we were able to muster during the early scenes.  For example, while revealing important backstory information in one scene, a primary character is essentially turned into a talking robot, with lines like ""the government spent untold billions..."" and other lines that no person (especially a soldier) would speak.  Other technicalities, such as problems with military protocol, dress, and operations are only slightly less annoying.In the film's defense, while essentially using a plot line that has been regurgitated by horror writers for decades (plague > death > survival > search for cure), the actors are at least average, and the sets are well designed and used.  This is certainly a b-movie, but it is one of the better ones out there, holding its place among others in the genre.",3,"Worth watching, better than your average b-horror film...",1217808000,"08 4, 2008",2008,1170,"['film', 'better-than-average', 'B-horror/thriller', 'notable', 'positives', 'negatives.The', 'primary', 'area', 'video', 'stilted', 'dialog', 'put', 'place', 'screenwriter', 'writer', 'humanize', 'dialog', 'numerous', 'places', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'remove', 'viewer', 'film', 'eliminating', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'were', 'able', 'muster', 'early', 'scenes', 'example', 'revealing', 'important', 'backstory', 'information', 'one', 'scene', 'primary', 'character', 'essentially', 'turned', 'talking', 'robot', 'lines', 'government', 'spent', 'untold', 'billions', 'other', 'lines', 'person', 'especially', 'soldier', 'would', 'speak', 'Other', 'technicalities', 'such', 'problems', 'military', 'protocol', 'dress', 'operations', 'are', 'only', 'slightly', 'less', 'film', 'defense', 'essentially', 'using', 'plot', 'line', 'been', 'regurgitated', 'horror', 'writers', 'decades', 'plague', '>', 'death', '>', 'survival', '>', 'search', 'cure', 'actors', 'are', 'least', 'average', 'sets', 'are', 'well', 'designed', 'used', 'certainly', 'b-movie', 'one', 'better', 'ones', 'there', 'holding', 'place', 'others', 'genre']",Organizm
