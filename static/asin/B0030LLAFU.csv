Let's say maybe 5 minutes worth of the movie. Essentially Goemon goes by the ""Greatest thief to live"" but he started out as a ninja serving his master that saved him as a small child and taught him how to become strong so that nothing could be taken from him. His master/mentor then was assasinated in which Goemon then took on his ""freedom"" and went into stealing for a living.Then his past comes back to haunt him and you begin to see how all of the main characters have such a deep history together and everything you thought was wrong.In  the end I would say this was a pretty good movie. It has some great fighting scenes but I will warn you that this is not a realistic action movie. It has unbeleiveable jumping and swordplay that go well with ninja movies.Not sure if I will watch this movie again though.

1315544,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B0030LLAFU,DVD Verdict,"[1, 2]","Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict -- ""For straight-up sensory overload, not much is going to eclipse the craziness of Goemon. Before I continue, fair warning: If CGI leaves you cold, steer clear. Like 300, Goemon is virtually all computer-generated, featuring actors with their prop swords (in most cases) standing in front of green screens delivering their lines. In fact, there were more than a few occasions that it felt like I was simply watching an extended cut-scene for a Japanese role-playing game on the PS3. I am on record as someone who has become ambivalent towards CGI overuse, especially with regards to action scenes, but I'll give Goemon a pass; from the outset we're in a hyper-stylized world and realism isn't a commodity. My two biggest problems stem from the substance and the style: 1) the film is not a brisk two hours, its myriad sub-plots, character arcs and exposition chunks slowing the momentum down far too much and, 2) the potentially coolest action moments were nearly impossible to see. I could handle a sagging pace--and the middle act of Goedon is glacial--if the action pay-off was ample, but mostly I was squinting just to decipher the over-the-top computer renderings. For example, there's a huge scene toward the end as Goemon scales a tower to square off with the evil lord and he has bound through ascending levels, defeating ninjas and dodging cannon fire. Nifty in theory but almost impossible to follow thanks to the overwhelming busy-ness and hyperactive edits that were stuffed in. Not that the Blu-ray wasn't trying, because the 2.35:1 transfer (1080p, MPEG-4 AVC) is a strong performer. The resolution provides an eyeful, which can be bittersweet: there is some seriously gorgeous effects to gawk at, but the enhanced clarity also pull the rug out from underneath some laughable visual effects. Two engrossing Dolby TrueHD audio tracks: Japanese 6.1 and English 6.1 (go with the original for the extra channel and the lack of dubbing) are included. The disc is rounded out by an hour's worth of behind-the-scenes content, showcasing how the film was staged and the effects were incorporated.""",3,Epic CGI Tomfoolery,1310774400,"07 16, 2011",2011,2137,"['Judge', 'David', 'Johnson', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'straight-up', 'sensory', 'overload', 'not', 'much', 'going', 'eclipse', 'craziness', 'Goemon', 'continue', 'fair', 'warning', 'CGI', 'cold', 'steer', 'clear', '300', 'Goemon', 'virtually', 'computer-generated', 'featuring', 'actors', 'prop', 'swords', 'most', 'cases', 'standing', 'front', 'green', 'screens', 'delivering', 'lines', 'fact', 'were', 'more', 'few', 'occasions', 'felt', 'was', 'simply', 'watching', 'extended', 'cut-scene', 'Japanese', 'role-playing', 'game', 'PS3', 'am', 'record', 'someone', 'who', 'become', 'ambivalent', 'towards', 'CGI', 'overuse', 'especially', 'regards', 'action', 'scenes', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Goemon', 'pass', 'outset', ""'re"", 'hyper-stylized', 'world', 'realism', ""n't"", 'commodity', 'two', 'biggest', 'problems', 'stem', 'substance', 'style', '1', 'film', 'not', 'brisk', 'two', 'hours', 'myriad', 'sub-plots', 'character', 'arcs', 'exposition', 'chunks', 'slowing', 'momentum', 'down', 'far', 'too', 'much', '2', 'potentially', 'coolest', 'action', 'moments', 'were', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'see', 'could', 'handle', 'sagging', 'pace', 'middle', 'act', 'Goedon', 'glacial', 'action', 'pay-off', 'was', 'ample', 'mostly', 'was', 'squinting', 'just', 'decipher', 'over-the-top', 'computer', 'renderings', 'example', 'huge', 'scene', 'end', 'Goemon', 'tower', 'square', 'off', 'evil', 'lord', 'bound', 'ascending', 'levels', 'defeating', 'ninjas', 'dodging', 'cannon', 'fire', 'Nifty', 'theory', 'almost', 'impossible', 'follow', 'thanks', 'overwhelming', 'busy-ness', 'hyperactive', 'edits', 'were', 'stuffed', 'Not', 'Blu-ray', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', '2.35:1', 'transfer', '1080p', 'MPEG-4', 'AVC', 'strong', 'performer', 'resolution', 'eyeful', 'can', 'be', 'bittersweet', 'seriously', 'gorgeous', 'effects', 'gawk', 'enhanced', 'clarity', 'also', 'rug', 'underneath', 'laughable', 'visual', 'effects', 'Two', 'engrossing', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', 'audio', 'tracks', 'Japanese', '6.1', 'English', '6.1', 'go', 'original', 'extra', 'channel', 'lack', 'dubbing', 'are', 'included', 'disc', 'rounded', 'out', 'hour', 'worth', 'behind-the-scenes', 'content', 'showcasing', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'staged', 'effects', 'were', 'incorporated']",Goemon

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[68, 70]","Goemon is a Japanese folk hero in the tradition of Robin Hood -- fighting tyranny and robbing the rich to give to the poor.So he was inevitably the subject of an action movie, simply called ""Goemon."" This sleek, stylized historical-fantasy movie looks a little like the ninja lovechild ofThe Adventures of Robin Hoodand300, but the mix of humor, romance and sharply-drawn action takes a shockingly dark turn in the movie's last third.Goemon Ishikawa (Ysuke Eguchi) is a clever master thief who likes to give his stolen valuables to the impoverished. But fifteen years ago, he was a loyal ninja serving the brilliant warlord Oda Nobunaga (Hashinosuk&eacute; Nakamura) -- and after Nobunaga was murdered by a traitor, the disillusioned Goemon became a wandering thief and friend to the poor.That is, until a literal Pandora's box shows him that Toyotomi Hideyoshi was involved in his master's death -- the very man who is taking Goemon's childhood sweetheart Chacha (Ryoko Hirosue) as his concubine, and preparing to declare war using Western weapons. Along with his old friend/rival Saizo (Takao sawa), Goemon sets out to attack Hideyoshi... but they soon discover that this path only leads to tragedy.""Goemon"" is one of those movies that has a good-but-not-great script, paired with spellbindingly lovely visuals -- explosive ninja battles on golden rooftops, waterfalls surrounded by glimmering fireflies, and sea battles full of blood and fire. It's a pretty wild ride, and the only problem is that a couple of the characters feel unnecessary (the little boy Goemon rescues).The first two-thirds of the movie are a pretty steady stream of action, brief romantic scenes, and sepia-toned flashbacks of Goemon's childhood (and especially of the charismatic Nobunaga). But after that, the movie becomes much darker and bleaker, with innocent people being horribly killed and Goemon becoming a more hardened, dark person.Egichi does a great job as Goemon, both as the rakish thief and the tormented ninja avenger -- sort of like a Japanese Errol Flynn with a touch of Harrison Ford. He's funny, charming and eventually heartwrenching. Hirosue is decent, although she doesn't get to do much except wear enormous dresses and look sad.But honestly, the title character often gets eclipsed by Saizo -- this is a strong, tragic man who is torn between his old friendship, his intense love for his wife and baby, and his often nasty job. Osawa gives a beautiful performance full of raw emotion, which climaxes in an impassioned speech to the masses, apparently inspiring them to rebel.""Goemon"" sculpts a folk legend into a fun, thrilling and ultimately tragic adventure movie, and turns out a pretty good movie while it's at it.",4,The master thief,1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,2719,"['Goemon', 'Japanese', 'folk', 'hero', 'tradition', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'fighting', 'tyranny', 'robbing', 'rich', 'give', 'poor.So', 'was', 'inevitably', 'subject', 'action', 'movie', 'simply', 'called', 'Goemon', 'sleek', 'stylized', 'historical-fantasy', 'movie', 'little', 'ninja', 'lovechild', 'ofThe', 'Adventures', 'Robin', 'Hoodand300', 'mix', 'humor', 'romance', 'sharply-drawn', 'action', 'shockingly', 'dark', 'turn', 'movie', 'last', 'third.Goemon', 'Ishikawa', 'Ysuke', 'Eguchi', 'clever', 'master', 'thief', 'who', 'give', 'stolen', 'valuables', 'impoverished', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'loyal', 'ninja', 'serving', 'brilliant', 'warlord', 'Oda', 'Nobunaga', 'Hashinosuk', 'eacute', 'Nakamura', 'Nobunaga', 'was', 'murdered', 'traitor', 'disillusioned', 'Goemon', 'became', 'wandering', 'thief', 'friend', 'poor.That', 'literal', 'Pandora', 'box', 'Toyotomi', 'Hideyoshi', 'was', 'involved', 'master', 'death', 'very', 'man', 'who', 'taking', 'Goemon', 'childhood', 'sweetheart', 'Chacha', 'Ryoko', 'Hirosue', 'concubine', 'preparing', 'declare', 'war', 'using', 'Western', 'weapons', 'old', 'friend/rival', 'Saizo', 'Takao', 'sawa', 'Goemon', 'out', 'attack', 'Hideyoshi', 'soon', 'discover', 'path', 'only', 'tragedy', 'Goemon', 'one', 'movies', 'good-but-not-great', 'script', 'paired', 'spellbindingly', 'lovely', 'visuals', 'explosive', 'ninja', 'battles', 'golden', 'rooftops', 'waterfalls', 'surrounded', 'glimmering', 'fireflies', 'sea', 'battles', 'full', 'blood', 'fire', 'pretty', 'wild', 'ride', 'only', 'problem', 'couple', 'characters', 'feel', 'unnecessary', 'little', 'boy', 'Goemon', 'rescues', '.The', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'steady', 'stream', 'action', 'brief', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'sepia-toned', 'flashbacks', 'Goemon', 'childhood', 'especially', 'charismatic', 'Nobunaga', 'movie', 'much', 'darker', 'bleaker', 'innocent', 'people', 'being', 'horribly', 'killed', 'Goemon', 'becoming', 'more', 'hardened', 'dark', 'person.Egichi', 'great', 'job', 'Goemon', 'rakish', 'thief', 'tormented', 'ninja', 'avenger', 'sort', 'Japanese', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'touch', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'funny', 'charming', 'eventually', 'heartwrenching', 'Hirosue', 'decent', ""n't"", 'get', 'do', 'much', 'wear', 'enormous', 'dresses', 'look', 'sad.But', 'honestly', 'title', 'character', 'often', 'eclipsed', 'Saizo', 'strong', 'tragic', 'man', 'who', 'torn', 'old', 'friendship', 'intense', 'love', 'wife', 'baby', 'often', 'nasty', 'job', 'Osawa', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'full', 'raw', 'emotion', 'climaxes', 'impassioned', 'speech', 'masses', 'apparently', 'inspiring', 'rebel', 'Goemon', 'folk', 'legend', 'fun', 'thrilling', 'ultimately', 'tragic', 'adventure', 'movie', 'out', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie']",Goemon

1315555,A29K6FQJ7PWQ19,B0030LLAFU,mr. impulse buyer,"[5, 5]","This movie caught my eye, as I have been trying to increase my Foreign Film collection.  I have always been curious with anything that has to do with Japanese history (especially the unification period).  It literally grabbed my attention in the first minute and a half, and never let go.  The time period this movie is based on was one full of civil strife and unrest for Japan, with class and rank clearly defined and Feudal Lords constantly fighting for power to control the whole country.  And while the movie stylizes the mood and scenery greatly in regards to these things, it still held some historical accuracy.  Most of the main characters in the movie actually existed during this time period:  Oda Nobunaga, Mitsuhide Aketchi, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Ieyasu Tokogawa, Hitori Hanzo.  I'm sure there are more, but those are the ones I caught.Many of the reviews have brought up the utter beauty of the landscape and architectural design.  Needless to say, I am on the same side of the fence.  Scenes in the forest FEEL like a forest, scenes in a castle FEEL like a castle, and so on.  Sometimes you DO feel like it's obvious you're looking at a green screen or floor.  But it all seems integrated smoothly with the actors/actresses utilizing that space, so you don't end up paying attention to it that closely.  The sets are busy; lots of extras wandering around and adding ""life"" to the background.  The colors are vibrant and the sound is crisp and clear.  My only qualm with quality is that the English dub track sounds a bit ""goofy,"" whereas the Japanese track is emotional and feels more decisive.  Also with the Japanese track, you get 6.1 surround instead of Eng 5.1.....not a huge difference if you don't have the extra speaker.The action is frequent and fast!  Obviously, as one can see from the preview, the scope of realism is stretched.  But what good are action sequences that abide by all natural laws of physics?! Joking....but the action is good.  Some shots are up close and a little cluttered, but others are even paced and use a lot of form.To sum it up, this movie really took my breath away with an, albeit, LOOSE historical relevance, but historical nonetheless. The combination of action, drama, atmosphere, mood, and dialog progresses the movie fluidly and you may be surprised by how many times you catch yourself saying ""ah"" or ""wow.""***on a side note* If you are looking for any literature regarding the subject matter of this time period in Japanese history, I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend ""TAIKO.""

Many people I'm sure can tell that this was the same writers and effects creators who did the live action Cashhern movie but I actually found these characters to be more entertaining to watch then the previous mentioned movie.  The CGI seems overabundant and in some scenes unnecessary but it seems the director took to heart some of the Hollywood movies that relied heavily on CGI more then anything else. Also don't expect the CGI to be in the area of say the movie Avatar while it's not horrible it's not going to win any awards either.  The action scenes are pretty incredible and great to watch similar to another movie Shinobi-Heart Under Blade and will remind many of the fight scenes in many anime series like Bleach or Naruto.

Surprising it's spawned by the 'anonymous' mind of Kazuari Kirya, the man who wrote/directed GOEMON. Anonymous?He's only referred to as 'the enterprising director' on GOEMAN's package; He wrote/directed both the international cult sensation CASSHERN (a staggering, horribly beautiful marvel of inscrutability; viewers still argue online what it's about) and GOREMON's rip-roaring clearer-cut love/revenge/action/blood-fest.In fact the common denominator is a pacifist plea: War/imperialism is wrong, dumb, tragic, wasteful, inhumane, awful. So no surprise theme-wise for two films/one director/writer. (But that's just my interpretation; as said, many people see different messages; see for yourself.)GOEMONGoemon [Blu-ray]is more 'entertaining' and more clear-cut in its message. Yet it seems far less-sophisticated because its cautionary tale is more spelled out. For me only two elements deducted stars: The writing/editing didn't make it clear enough as to who was who and why they did what they did do. (RATS! I just discovered I could've gotten the BluRay version for a buck more... In DVD images are great; they must be something in BluRay)Then the english dubbing and subtitles seemed keyed to American teens; like colloquial terms that are cool. Contractions too, Which pertain too to the geysers of blood and rolling heads and bouncing body parts as well. 'Whatever' (yes a popular phrase for kids today), the marketing folk must have been aiming for the youth (gamers?) market. A very, very far cry from CASSHERNCasshern, which targeted more-sophisticated young adults.One criteria I put on films is will I see it again and maybe again?I've seen CASSHERN three or four times and will see it again. The visuals alone merit repeat exposures. And the script is as enigmatic as ever baffled viewers. Maybe that makes GOEMON CASSHERN Lite. (With VERY different scripts, action, graphics)I may see GOREMON maybe a few times more over the years. But the now too-familiar computer-generated troops charging, exploding enemies (just remembered: combatants used machine guns and grenades to trash one another) get less interesting viewed again and again.One thing both films offer though is great CGI and art direction. Both are dramatic eye feasts. GOREMON  wins for 'getting it' while CASSHERN wins for intriguing, multi-level thought-provoking conversation-starting concepts, conventional versus contrary.

1315562,A238W7T3KJAKQH,B0030LLAFU,shaun brammer,"[0, 1]","I have always enjoyed Asian moviemakers use of action and history, even if the action is a little over the top and the history taken artistic advantage of. In the case of Goemon, however, the advantage taken was beyond the line of good taste. The events of the story are based, loosely, upon the events near the end of the medieval period of Japan, what is most commonly called Sengoku, or country at war. Almost all of the characters, major ones and minor ones, are at least named after historical people, but that is where the relation to history stops.How history is handled in this movie is almost comical expect for one fact that makes it insulting. This is just a movie and no reasonable intelligent person believes that history will be treated honorably by those who make entertainment, and sometimes that is just fine. However, in Goemon, the goal of the hero is to kill Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a general of Oda Nobunage who very briefly unified Japan before Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1600. The events in the movie have Hideyoshi meet his end before he orders the invasion of the Korean peninsula. This invasion, known as the Imjin War, lasted for seven years and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It was an utter failure for Hideyoshi and was a brutal war for the Korean people. The fact that this movie wants to dig up the roots of history to tell their tale and then skip over these blood soaked seven years straight to the Battle of Sekigahara is insulting. Perhaps such an inslut could be forgiven if the entertainment factor was there, but that is not the case.While Goemon is live action, it takes on an Anime influenced fantasy appearance with a touch of steam-punk. The steam-punk element is mostly found in the firearms used and a few objects, like a very sophisticated door and a mechanical Pandora's Box. The Anime influence is even more apparent because everything is computer generated, even the actors themselves during some action scenes. This really doesn't work well, as nothing looks real. The entire world is computer generated, grass, water, trees, sometimes even the furniture the actors are sitting on looks generated. The CGI effects are not good, there is a horrible contrast between the actors and their environment. If one wanted to be nice they could say that this was done on purpose to bring closer the worlds of live action and Anime, but the argument that the production company is cheap could also have a strong case.The writing is terrible. At the beginning of the movie a lieutenant of Hideyoshi, Mitsunari, is having his men search for Pandora's Box, which Goemon has stolen. They are very worried over it and are killing anyone who might get wind of it. So, one would think that this box would play a large role in this tale, which it doesn't. You see it at the start and then in disappears. It is not even explained why a object of western mythology is in Japan in the first place. No one talks about it until the very end when Goemon hands to a young boy he has been taking care of and gives him some banal speech about hope, or not being vengeful, before Goemon goes and avenges the death of his former lord Nobunaga. I am not sure. No one says anything worth saying or anything that makes that much sense. The motivations of the character is equally unclear. While it might seem like vengeance or greed is a motivation, characters don't seem fully committed. Of course, this could be the fault of the actors who are all flat and deadpan. Whether it is the fault of the writers, the director, or actors there is very little emotion or believably to these Anime devolved historical figures.The only thing the actors have going for them is their looks. Just about everyone in this movie is model from a magazine cover. Expect for those men who are to inspire a very weak and ineffectual comic relief, they are all handsome and stoic. The women are beautiful even when wearing some of the most ridiculous costumes. While everyone's hair is in place and make-up impeccably done this doesn't help the movie. The unbelievable good looks of the actors just adds to the unbelievably of the entire movie. It does however explain their poor acting.",1,Goemon Stole My Time,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",2013,4200,"['have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Asian', 'moviemakers', 'use', 'action', 'history', 'even', 'action', 'little', 'top', 'history', 'taken', 'artistic', 'advantage', 'case', 'Goemon', 'however', 'advantage', 'taken', 'was', 'line', 'good', 'taste', 'events', 'story', 'are', 'based', 'loosely', 'events', 'end', 'medieval', 'period', 'Japan', 'what', 'most', 'commonly', 'called', 'Sengoku', 'country', 'war', 'Almost', 'characters', 'major', 'ones', 'minor', 'ones', 'are', 'least', 'named', 'historical', 'people', 'where', 'relation', 'history', 'stops.How', 'history', 'handled', 'movie', 'almost', 'comical', 'expect', 'one', 'fact', 'insulting', 'just', 'movie', 'reasonable', 'intelligent', 'person', 'history', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'honorably', 'who', 'make', 'entertainment', 'sometimes', 'just', 'fine', 'However', 'Goemon', 'goal', 'hero', 'kill', 'Toyotomi', 'Hideyoshi', 'general', 'Oda', 'Nobunage', 'who', 'very', 'briefly', 'unified', 'Japan', 'Tokugawa', 'Ieyasu', '1600', 'events', 'movie', 'have', 'Hideyoshi', 'meet', 'end', 'orders', 'invasion', 'Korean', 'peninsula', 'invasion', 'known', 'Imjin', 'War', 'lasted', 'seven', 'years', 'resulted', 'deaths', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'people', 'was', 'utter', 'failure', 'Hideyoshi', 'was', 'brutal', 'war', 'Korean', 'people', 'fact', 'movie', 'dig', 'up', 'roots', 'history', 'tell', 'tale', 'then', 'skip', 'blood', 'soaked', 'seven', 'years', 'straight', 'Battle', 'Sekigahara', 'insulting', 'Perhaps', 'such', 'inslut', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'entertainment', 'factor', 'was', 'there', 'not', 'case.While', 'Goemon', 'live', 'action', 'Anime', 'influenced', 'fantasy', 'appearance', 'touch', 'steam-punk', 'steam-punk', 'element', 'mostly', 'found', 'firearms', 'used', 'few', 'objects', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'door', 'mechanical', 'Pandora', 'Box', 'Anime', 'influence', 'even', 'more', 'apparent', 'everything', 'computer', 'generated', 'even', 'actors', 'action', 'scenes', 'really', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'nothing', 'real', 'entire', 'world', 'computer', 'generated', 'grass', 'water', 'trees', 'sometimes', 'even', 'furniture', 'actors', 'are', 'sitting', 'looks', 'generated', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'horrible', 'contrast', 'actors', 'environment', 'one', 'wanted', 'be', 'nice', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'done', 'purpose', 'bring', 'closer', 'worlds', 'live', 'action', 'Anime', 'argument', 'production', 'company', 'cheap', 'could', 'also', 'have', 'strong', 'case.The', 'writing', 'terrible', 'beginning', 'movie', 'lieutenant', 'Hideyoshi', 'Mitsunari', 'having', 'men', 'search', 'Pandora', 'Box', 'Goemon', 'stolen', 'are', 'very', 'worried', 'are', 'killing', 'anyone', 'who', 'might', 'get', 'So', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'box', 'would', 'play', 'large', 'role', 'tale', ""n't"", 'see', 'start', 'then', 'disappears', 'not', 'even', 'explained', 'why', 'object', 'western', 'mythology', 'Japan', 'first', 'place', 'one', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'Goemon', 'young', 'boy', 'been', 'taking', 'care', 'banal', 'speech', 'hope', 'not', 'being', 'vengeful', 'Goemon', 'death', 'former', 'lord', 'Nobunaga', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'anything', 'worth', 'saying', 'anything', 'much', 'sense', 'motivations', 'character', 'equally', 'unclear', 'might', 'seem', 'vengeance', 'greed', 'motivation', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fully', 'committed', 'course', 'could', 'be', 'fault', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'flat', 'deadpan', 'fault', 'writers', 'director', 'actors', 'very', 'little', 'emotion', 'believably', 'Anime', 'devolved', 'historical', 'figures.The', 'only', 'thing', 'actors', 'have', 'going', 'looks', 'Just', 'everyone', 'movie', 'model', 'magazine', 'cover', 'Expect', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'inspire', 'very', 'weak', 'ineffectual', 'comic', 'relief', 'are', 'handsome', 'stoic', 'women', 'are', 'beautiful', 'even', 'when', 'wearing', 'most', 'ridiculous', 'costumes', 'everyone', 'hair', 'place', 'make-up', 'impeccably', 'done', ""n't"", 'help', 'movie', 'unbelievable', 'good', 'looks', 'actors', 'just', 'unbelievably', 'entire', 'movie', 'however', 'explain', 'poor', 'acting']",Goemon

This movie is a modern, stylized tale of Ninjas, Samurai, and cruel Shoguns in 16th century Japan. This movie contains many other legendary Japanese historical figures. Goemon uses CGI to make the live action more like an anime people jump higher, run faster, etc... The CGI is over the top and sometimes takes away from the story but is generally good. There are a few scenes at the end that are the coolest action scenes I have seen in any action movie. The soundtrack is top notch with sweeping and emotionally charged symphonic music. The humor in this movie seems awkward and out of place and there are about 5 scenes they could have done without. The princess like character has a really stupid name ""Lady Chacha."" The romance between Chacha and Goemon seems forced and a bit awkward. Goemon is overall a really good movie but it is not for everyone. I would highly recommend hard core anime fans seeing Goemon.

All of the plot elements are derivative from one source or another, with an overwhelming amount of cliched dialogue and situations.  To make up for the lack of originality in the story, they jazz up the visual elements with anachronistic hairstyles, make-up and costumes.  The CGI is bad, and there's way too much of it.  Was there a single shot that didn't have CGI?  It will take awhile for me to get over the fact that I wasted money and time (a lot of time, too, 2 hours and 10 minutes) on this junk.  It's meant to look epic, but it's just silly.
