Al Qasim,"[1, 1]","First of all, let me begin by saying that I do realize that this movie is based on a true story before I say what I am about to say.When it comes to mafia/ gangster movies, it's OK but not really great like Casino, Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco, Bugsy, or the ultimate benchmark, The Godfather. I'll probably only watch this one a few times and then it will sit there occupying space on my shelf.I have noticed that there is great overlap between Gotti's character and several characters in the Godfather movie... Joey Zaza (the flash mobster), Frank Pantangeli (the rat), and a few others... I think these characters are somewhat typical as they either really happened or seem expected in any gangster movie.WARNING: The DVD box is so flimsy that mine broke while trying to unwrap the plastic!

411045,A20CR4907G7CTS,6304285116,Jeff Marzano,"[1, 1]","Based on TV shows I have seen like Mobsters and others this movie matches up pretty well with real events.It's interesting how certain events happened at particular times to allow this story to unfold the way it did.The FBI had bugged the talkative and aptly nicknamed Angelo 'Quack Quack' Ruggiero's house.  Those surveillance tapes contained statements about how John 'Jonny Boy' Gotti's crew was selling drugs and how much they hated Gambino family boss Paul 'Big Paul' Castellano.  Gotti's friend and mentor Aniello 'Mr. Neil' Dellacroce tried to delay turning the tapes over to Big Paul since he knew this would be a death sentence for Johnny Boy.  But then Dellacroce died.  At that point Gotti had to take action against Big Paul or get whacked himself.  But Johnny Boy probably wouldn't have done this while Mr. Neil was still alive.Salvatore 'Sammy the Bull' Gravano  is portrayed as a very greedy and untrustworthy person who would kill anyone for money.  The movie captures the atmosphere of mistrust and high stress and fear that is part of the mafia life.  All of the murders committed by The Bull added to Gotti's paranoia and deep sorrow as he had to face the horrible reality of what he had become a part of.  Pictures of people in the mafia sometimes convey the extreme negative energy reflected in their faces.There was a strange event in Gotti's life where his young son was struck and killed by a car that was driven by his next door neighbor.  The neighbor wasn't able to move out of town fast enough.  This was an accident however and it doesn't seem like this guy should have been subjected to Gotti's murderous wrath.The movie at times portrays Gotti as a beloved public figure and media darling where people want his autograph, shoot off fireworks when he is found innocent in court, etc..  I'm not sure how accurate this portrayal really is though.  People should be careful about who they want for their heroes as Colombia found out when they idolized Pablo Escobar.The casting is good for this movie.  Some of the actors actually look like the real people including Gotti, Dellacroce, Sammy The Bull, and Quack Quack.A possible sequel or related movie would be about Anthony 'Gaspipe' Casso.  Gaspipe was given the assignment to whack Gotti after the Castellano hit.  Gaspipe went off the deep end after Gotti's boys tried to whack him in return.  Gaspipe Casso became so violent that the mafia guys started turning to the FBI for their own safety.It was I guess excessive violence and greed that took a major toll on La Cosa Nostra.  Gotti's love of the public spotlight and media attention didn't help either.  John Gotti was probably one of the worst things that ever happened to the mafia.The entire 20th century in America was in some ways a struggle to get control over criminal elements and corruption.Jeff MarzanoThe Men Who Killed Kennedy",5,Historically Accurate,1338163200,"05 28, 2012",2012,2875,"['Based', 'TV', 'shows', 'have', 'seen', 'Mobsters', 'others', 'movie', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'real', 'events.It', 'interesting', 'how', 'certain', 'events', 'happened', 'particular', 'times', 'allow', 'story', 'unfold', 'way', 'FBI', 'had', 'bugged', 'talkative', 'aptly', 'nicknamed', 'Angelo', 'Quack', 'Ruggiero', 'house', 'surveillance', 'tapes', 'contained', 'statements', 'how', 'John', 'Boy', 'Gotti', 'crew', 'was', 'selling', 'drugs', 'how', 'much', 'hated', 'Gambino', 'family', 'boss', 'Paul', 'Paul', 'Castellano', 'Gotti', 'friend', 'mentor', 'Aniello', ""'Mr"", 'Neil', 'Dellacroce', 'tried', 'delay', 'turning', 'tapes', 'Big', 'Paul', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'death', 'sentence', 'Johnny', 'Boy', 'then', 'Dellacroce', 'died', 'point', 'Gotti', 'had', 'take', 'action', 'Big', 'Paul', 'get', 'whacked', 'Johnny', 'Boy', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'Mr.', 'Neil', 'was', 'still', 'alive.Salvatore', 'Bull', 'Gravano', 'portrayed', 'very', 'greedy', 'untrustworthy', 'person', 'who', 'would', 'kill', 'anyone', 'money', 'movie', 'atmosphere', 'mistrust', 'high', 'stress', 'fear', 'part', 'mafia', 'life', 'murders', 'committed', 'Bull', 'added', 'Gotti', 'paranoia', 'deep', 'sorrow', 'had', 'face', 'horrible', 'reality', 'what', 'had', 'become', 'part', 'Pictures', 'people', 'mafia', 'sometimes', 'convey', 'extreme', 'negative', 'energy', 'reflected', 'faces.There', 'was', 'strange', 'event', 'Gotti', 'life', 'where', 'young', 'son', 'was', 'struck', 'killed', 'car', 'was', 'driven', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'neighbor', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'move', 'town', 'fast', 'enough', 'was', 'accident', 'however', ""n't"", 'seem', 'guy', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'subjected', 'Gotti', 'murderous', 'wrath.The', 'movie', 'times', 'portrays', 'Gotti', 'beloved', 'public', 'figure', 'media', 'darling', 'where', 'people', 'want', 'autograph', 'shoot', 'off', 'fireworks', 'when', 'found', 'innocent', 'court', 'etc..', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'really', 'People', 'should', 'be', 'careful', 'who', 'want', 'heroes', 'Colombia', 'found', 'out', 'when', 'idolized', 'Pablo', 'Escobar.The', 'casting', 'good', 'movie', 'actors', 'actually', 'look', 'real', 'people', 'including', 'Gotti', 'Dellacroce', 'Sammy', 'Bull', 'Quack', 'Quack.A', 'possible', 'sequel', 'related', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'Anthony', ""'Gaspipe"", 'Casso', 'Gaspipe', 'was', 'given', 'assignment', 'whack', 'Gotti', 'Castellano', 'hit', 'Gaspipe', 'went', 'deep', 'end', 'Gotti', 'boys', 'tried', 'whack', 'return', 'Gaspipe', 'Casso', 'became', 'so', 'violent', 'mafia', 'guys', 'started', 'turning', 'FBI', 'own', 'safety.It', 'was', 'guess', 'excessive', 'violence', 'greed', 'took', 'major', 'toll', 'La', 'Cosa', 'Nostra', 'Gotti', 'love', 'public', 'spotlight', 'media', 'attention', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'John', 'Gotti', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'things', 'ever', 'happened', 'mafia.The', 'entire', '20th', 'century', 'America', 'was', 'ways', 'struggle', 'get', 'control', 'criminal', 'elements', 'corruption.Jeff', 'MarzanoThe', 'Men', 'Who', 'Killed', 'Kennedy']",Gotti VHS

Despite the annoying vulgarities in every scene, the viewer would definitely be taken by the capable performance of actors reliving the voices, facial expressions, eye contacts, and emotions of characters that convey realistic feeling of the underworld of the mafia.John Gotti was portrayed as a clean, charismatic, and beloved actor within the standards of criminals. A sort of a child who grew up to adulthood in the total seclusion from the mainstream and whose mind and psyche had been programmed to serve the narrow goal of easy and immediate power within the gang and the family. He does not seem to have been exposed to alternative options when he was young enough to make the right choices. A family man who loves and respects his wife, children, neighbors but could not extend such empathy to the greater human family.The movie kept hammering the main constitution that strengthened the mafia and kept it afloat: ""la famielia and the rules that hold us together."" The well being of the very immediate family was protected by swift killing of enemies and potential violators. The mafia's highly principled adherence to the anti-doping federal policy of ""deal and die"" was truly an impressive lesson on how criminals could identify with higher goals of the society at large while committing capital crimes within their own communities.The movie would have been of greater value had it expanded on the legal debates within the court system beyond the charges of continual criminal activities and how it applies to federal courts invoking the constitution for locking those murky criminal.",5,"A feast of emotions, actions, and drama",1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,1684,"['hard', 'work', 'picking', 'best', 'fits', 'characters', 'rendered', 'movie', 'great', 'success', 'annoying', 'vulgarities', 'scene', 'viewer', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'taken', 'capable', 'performance', 'actors', 'reliving', 'voices', 'facial', 'expressions', 'eye', 'contacts', 'emotions', 'characters', 'convey', 'realistic', 'feeling', 'underworld', 'mafia.John', 'Gotti', 'was', 'portrayed', 'clean', 'charismatic', 'beloved', 'actor', 'standards', 'criminals', 'sort', 'child', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'adulthood', 'total', 'seclusion', 'mainstream', 'mind', 'psyche', 'had', 'been', 'programmed', 'serve', 'narrow', 'goal', 'easy', 'immediate', 'power', 'gang', 'family', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'exposed', 'alternative', 'options', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'enough', 'make', 'right', 'choices', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'children', 'neighbors', 'could', 'not', 'extend', 'such', 'empathy', 'greater', 'human', 'family.The', 'movie', 'kept', 'hammering', 'main', 'constitution', 'strengthened', 'mafia', 'kept', 'la', 'famielia', 'rules', 'hold', 'together', 'well', 'being', 'very', 'immediate', 'family', 'was', 'protected', 'swift', 'killing', 'enemies', 'potential', 'violators', 'mafia', 'highly', 'principled', 'adherence', 'anti-doping', 'federal', 'policy', 'deal', 'die', 'was', 'truly', 'impressive', 'lesson', 'how', 'criminals', 'could', 'identify', 'higher', 'goals', 'society', 'large', 'committing', 'capital', 'crimes', 'own', 'communities.The', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'greater', 'value', 'had', 'expanded', 'legal', 'debates', 'court', 'system', 'charges', 'continual', 'criminal', 'activities', 'how', 'federal', 'courts', 'invoking', 'constitution', 'locking', 'murky', 'criminal']",Gotti VHS

Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[3, 6]","This HBO flick is highly recommended for overall quotable value, good laughs, some good acting, and some good laughs.Was this film written by a Gotti family member?  I don't know where to begin.  Suffice to say that the film is not nearly the sum of its parts.  There are some good scenes, some good acting by Assante as Gotti (why hasn't Assante been in other mob flicks or even on The Sopranos?).  Anthony Quinn, who needs subtitles, is not bad as Neil Dellacroce, who dies of that mysterious movie illness where the character gets old and coughs a lot before checking out.  And of course, we have any number of Wiseguy Acting Guild members, such as Sopranos actors Frank Vincent, Vincent Pastore, Tony Sirico, and Dominic Chianese.  William Forsythe looks nothing like Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano, and they make him the number one vilain in another of Forsythe's 'evil' roles.Gotti is portrayed as a gangster, yes, but also as some kind of pre-capitalist who spews wisdom about the 'parameters' of La Cosa Nostra, about 'the rules', and importantly, about members of his administration who are 'talking subversive'.  He is not pleased with Gravano due to his underboss' greed and to the unacceptable amount of legit money being made.  What kind of gangsters are making this much legit money?  Gotti rants about libertarian values, rails against the hypocrisy of the government and about white collar crime, and even goes so far as to correct one of his underlings' racial epithets (always loved that one) before he himself launches a few.As a realistic portrayal of Gotti, it's horrible, there's too much fiction, too many factual errors, utter nonsense being uttered by the characters, etc, etc.  But there's just a tremendous amount of quotable material, some great scenes, the requisite mob hits (apparently Paul Castellano was shot 50 times in slow motion) and a fantastic Assante hamming it up.  In 1998 a TV movie called Witness To The Mob appeared---an adaptation of Gravano's book 'Underboss'.  It's the perfect companion to this movie.  While Gravano is pure evil in this movie, in Witness, Gravano moralizes and Gotti is the man at fault.  And of course, some of the very same actors appear in both movies, only to die differently (Frank Vincent is shot in the head in this film before being blown up in a car bomb in Witness, his acting range fully explored).Just can't recommend this one enough.  The writers must have been under contract from the mob or perhaps under threat from the mob, but the absurdity is part of the charm.",4,Big words like 'parameters' and 'subversive' a staple of mob lexicon,1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,2541,"['HBO', 'flick', 'highly', 'recommended', 'overall', 'quotable', 'value', 'good', 'laughs', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'laughs.Was', 'film', 'written', 'Gotti', 'family', 'member', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'Suffice', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'nearly', 'sum', 'parts', 'are', 'good', 'scenes', 'good', 'acting', 'Assante', 'Gotti', 'why', ""n't"", 'Assante', 'been', 'other', 'mob', 'flicks', 'even', 'Sopranos', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'who', 'subtitles', 'not', 'bad', 'Neil', 'Dellacroce', 'who', 'mysterious', 'movie', 'illness', 'where', 'character', 'old', 'lot', 'checking', 'out', 'course', 'have', 'number', 'Wiseguy', 'Acting', 'Guild', 'members', 'such', 'Sopranos', 'actors', 'Frank', 'Vincent', 'Vincent', 'Pastore', 'Tony', 'Sirico', 'Dominic', 'Chianese', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'nothing', 'Sammy', 'Bull', 'Gravano', 'make', 'number', 'one', 'vilain', 'Forsythe', ""'evil"", 'roles.Gotti', 'portrayed', 'gangster', 'yes', 'also', 'kind', 'pre-capitalist', 'who', 'wisdom', ""'parameters"", 'La', 'Cosa', 'Nostra', 'rules', 'importantly', 'members', 'administration', 'who', 'are', ""'talking"", 'subversive', 'not', 'pleased', 'Gravano', 'due', 'underboss', 'greed', 'unacceptable', 'amount', 'legit', 'money', 'being', 'made', 'What', 'kind', 'gangsters', 'are', 'making', 'much', 'legit', 'money', 'Gotti', 'libertarian', 'values', 'rails', 'hypocrisy', 'government', 'white', 'collar', 'crime', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'correct', 'one', 'underlings', 'racial', 'epithets', 'always', 'loved', 'one', 'few.As', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'Gotti', 'horrible', 'too', 'much', 'fiction', 'too', 'many', 'factual', 'errors', 'utter', 'nonsense', 'being', 'uttered', 'characters', 'etc', 'etc', 'just', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'quotable', 'material', 'great', 'scenes', 'requisite', 'mob', 'hits', 'apparently', 'Paul', 'Castellano', 'was', 'shot', '50', 'times', 'slow', 'motion', 'fantastic', 'Assante', 'hamming', 'up', '1998', 'TV', 'movie', 'called', 'Witness', 'Mob', 'appeared', '-an', 'adaptation', 'Gravano', 'book', ""'Underboss"", 'perfect', 'companion', 'movie', 'Gravano', 'pure', 'evil', 'movie', 'Witness', 'Gravano', 'Gotti', 'man', 'fault', 'course', 'very', 'same', 'actors', 'appear', 'movies', 'only', 'die', 'differently', 'Frank', 'Vincent', 'shot', 'head', 'film', 'being', 'blown', 'up', 'car', 'bomb', 'Witness', 'acting', 'range', 'fully', 'explored', '.Just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'one', 'enough', 'writers', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'contract', 'mob', 'perhaps', 'threat', 'mob', 'absurdity', 'part', 'charm']",Gotti VHS

This is anabsurd notion, cheapening the fact that this was the leader of theGamino family, a major organization, and not of a high schoolproject or small fry association.On the other hand, the legal implications of the underlyingoperations runs by Gotti, are well demonstrated, in theirseriousness, definitiveness, and far-reaching potential, inparticular, of the RICO statutes in catching, convicting and imprisoningalleged organized criminals.At the end of the day, perhaps what did Gotti in, was his massmedia prominence, exposure and macro and micro influence in societywhich threatened its integrity, risking creating millions ofnegative copy-cat, non-compliant behavior of normal citizens, somethingthat could not be tolerated by the elite or by the majority at large.On the other band, the recession of 2008 in the USA, economicfailures and  misconduct of Wall St. organizations and thevictims of the war in the Middle East, ( since the turn of thedecade),  is  as serious, if not more, than  organized crime,yet ... gets a free pass simply because the integrity of society isnot at risk, nor does running the printing presses with fiatcurrency, and indebting future generations (who have no voicetoday) result in  any protests today.In sum,  the movie's script is somewhat shaky, by making thesuccess of Gotti seem too easy, too juvenile, too simple, taken forgranted ... as if anyone who is trigger-happy is only a step away frommaking a million dollars when that is anything  but the case.

When Carlo Gambino dies however, his decision to make Paul Castellano the head of the family doesn't sit well with Gotti and others. They all put up with it for several years but eventually, Gotti gets fed up with Castellano and has him killed, making himself head of the family in the process. Gotti was the subject of several Federal investigations but always managed to be found not guilty, earning the sobriquet The Teflon Don. Determined to get a conviction, the FBI finally manage to get him on tape not only admitting to crimes, but speculating on how he might have to do something about his right-hand man, Dammy ""The Bull"" Gravano. When presented with the information, Gravano makes a deal with the prosecutors and testifies against his one-time friend who is sentenced to life in prison without parole.
