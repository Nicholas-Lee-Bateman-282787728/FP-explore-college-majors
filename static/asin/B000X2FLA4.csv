They first released one in 2004, then another one a few months later, the only difference was the amount of music video.  Here we are in 2007 and Nickelback has ANOTHER video collection dvd, the only difference is like 2 or 3 music video wasen't featured on the last dvd release, like ""Rockstar"" ""If everyone cared"" Comeon Nickelback STOP releasing these music video collection dvds already. Never knew they where as MONEY HUNGRY like this before, save your money, just download the newer videos.",2,WHY!,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,588,"['Ok', 'first', 'love', 'Nickelback', 'WHY', 'are', 'releasing', 'yet', 'music', 'video', 'dvd', 'first', 'released', 'one', '2004', 'then', 'one', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'only', 'difference', 'was', 'amount', 'music', 'video', 'Here', 'are', '2007', 'Nickelback', 'ANOTHER', 'video', 'collection', 'dvd', 'only', 'difference', '2', '3', 'music', 'video', 'wase', ""n't"", 'featured', 'last', 'dvd', 'release', 'Rockstar', 'everyone', 'cared', 'Comeon', 'Nickelback', 'STOP', 'releasing', 'music', 'video', 'collection', 'dvds', 'already', 'Never', 'knew', 'where', 'MONEY', 'HUNGRY', 'save', 'money', 'just', 'download', 'newer', 'videos']",N/A

This video, has every single song to video and it'ss meaning of what the band wanted to say to defined that it is moving to the viewer.  I loved every single song as much as the previous one and can't even say I have a favorite because in my case they are all favorites.  I have been looking for a forum to tell the band what an impact they have made in my life.I am 49 years old and 9 years ago, I was diagnosed with severe Rheumatoid Arthritis,I was working on our 1200 acre Certified seed farm, driving huge tractors that I love, 1o hours a day discing fields and I brought the tractor in one night literally fell out of it, and it's a long fall, then came peripheral neuropathy of my feet, I could not even step on them, then came fibromyalgia, and X-RAYS of how bad my bones really were. My doctor blew out my kidneys with MTX, and didn't take responsiblity for it, and when you haave no money, you get no help. I was supposed to be dead but somehow, with all the reading in the E.R. saying I was, I wasn't. I was singing Nickelback in my head, and thinking this not bad at all. I did the worst for months at home not having a clue why I was so sick !I am now crippled, and I am fighting chronic kidney failure, and these guys I turn on and listen to as loud ad I can, when ever  the mood stieks me, Their mood makes me feel like no matter what I have to face, and it's a lot, I can do it. I can stand up for a few seconds and praise that I could wash dishes, or take a shower, or read a book for I have Sjogren's Diseass too.  =I need all the guys in the band that their albums and the songs they write make a difference.  They touch lives.  They keep me going and reflect what happens in all of our lives.  I love them all and their work.  I just love all thei work.
