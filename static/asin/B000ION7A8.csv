Stauff ""Ann""","[1, 1]","Having seen It's a Wonderful Life every Christmas for years, we decided to expand Jimmy Stewart knowledge which led to this collection of Frank Capra's movies.  What a gifted man Mr. Capra was....In the 1995 movie ""The American President"" staring Michael Douglas and Annette Bening, she has a discussion with the Security Guard as she enters the White House for the first time.  He described the ""Capra-esque feeling"" she is experiencing and I believe this feeling is a warm & fuzzy that the DVDs in this collection give you as you watch.All of the movies here were interesting, clean fun and well done.  Make sure you watch the Narrative section with Mr. Capra's son.  You will learn a great deal of the back stories behind the movies topic, filming schedule, people's opinions and just nice stuff about his Dad.  We were so pleased to watch movies without language, scenes and violence that so crowd our screens today.  This is well worth the money.

1022132,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,B000ION7A8,Douglas M,"[6, 7]","This DVD collection is obviously going to be popular with sure fire entertainments such as ""You Can't take it with You"" and ""Mr Smith goes to Washington"" but the package goes much further by providing lengthy interviews with Capra's son about each of the films, a detailed documentary about Capra himself, expert commentaries with each film and a detailed booklet.  This is outstanding value.All of the films are excellent and Amazon themselves provide worthwhile summaries.  Here are a few observations:- ""Mr Deeds goes to Town"" is my least favourite and probably most guilty of what is called ""Capra corn"".  Gary Cooper was often a mannered actor and for me he overdoes his ""Aw shucks"" country bumpkin. Jean Arthur compensates enormously, making believable that this worldly ""babe"" could fall for Mr Deeds. She helps Cooper enormously to pull off his performance.- ""American Madness"", made in 1932 before Capra really hit the bigtime, benefits from a shorter running time with a fast pace created by the editing. At the height of the Depression, a story about a run on a bank was timely and the note of optimism sounded by the resolution was refreshing.  Walter Huston is outstanding as the head of the bank and the serene Kay Johnson, a poised and beautiful presence in any film, plays his wife.  The film has one great set and Capra moves his camera around it, including some powerful overhead shots.  His crowd scenes are outstanding as always.- Jean Arthur was a wonderful actress and if her parts in each film are quite similar, it doesn't matter. With her husky inimitable voice and warm smile, she is memorable.- Clark Gable is very funny in ""It happened One Night"", a very underrated comedian.- ""Mr Smith goes to Washington"" has similarities to ""Mr Deeds"" but is superior in every way. The documentaries tell that in fact, it was originally conceived as a sequel. James Stewart is much more convincing than Gary Cooper and the yarn has far more tension then the earlier film.  It is much less dated. The film was very popular on its release except in Washington where the depiction of political corruption was considered ""un-American"".All of the prints are good, although ""It happened One Night"" suffers from grainy scenes.  The films benefit from Capra's attention to detail, particularly the character actors which populated his films. The documentaries tell us that actors lived to appear in a Capra film because they knew that even the smallest part would be treated with loving attention. The most amusing story about this is the casting of Harry Cary in ""Mr Smith"" as the Speaker in the Senate. On paper, the part was minor but there are numerous telling close ups as he reflects the audience reaction to what is happening. It is a very important role.The documentary about Capra himself tells of his beginnings as an Italian immigrant.  Undoubtedly, his own rise from humble beginnings influenced his view of America as the land of opportunity and his depiction of the power of the people.  He lived the ""American Dream"". Even if you are uncomfortable with the idealism expounded in most of the films (Capra corn), each film tells a good story and provides great entertainment.",5,Outstanding value DVD set,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,3194,"['DVD', 'collection', 'obviously', 'going', 'be', 'popular', 'sure', 'fire', 'entertainments', 'such', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'Mr', 'Smith', 'Washington', 'package', 'much', 'further', 'providing', 'lengthy', 'interviews', 'Capra', 'son', 'films', 'detailed', 'documentary', 'Capra', 'expert', 'commentaries', 'film', 'detailed', 'booklet', 'outstanding', 'value.All', 'films', 'are', 'excellent', 'Amazon', 'provide', 'worthwhile', 'summaries', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'observations', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'Town', 'least', 'favourite', 'probably', 'most', 'guilty', 'what', 'called', 'Capra', 'corn', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'was', 'often', 'mannered', 'actor', 'Aw', 'shucks', 'country', 'bumpkin', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'enormously', 'making', 'believable', 'worldly', 'babe', 'could', 'fall', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'Cooper', 'enormously', 'pull', 'off', 'performance.-', 'American', 'Madness', 'made', '1932', 'Capra', 'really', 'hit', 'bigtime', 'benefits', 'shorter', 'running', 'time', 'fast', 'pace', 'created', 'editing', 'height', 'Depression', 'story', 'run', 'bank', 'was', 'timely', 'note', 'optimism', 'sounded', 'resolution', 'was', 'refreshing', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'outstanding', 'head', 'bank', 'serene', 'Kay', 'Johnson', 'poised', 'beautiful', 'presence', 'film', 'wife', 'film', 'one', 'great', 'set', 'Capra', 'camera', 'including', 'powerful', 'overhead', 'shots', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'are', 'outstanding', 'always.-', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'was', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'quite', 'similar', ""n't"", 'matter', 'husky', 'inimitable', 'voice', 'warm', 'smile', 'memorable.-', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'very', 'funny', 'happened', 'One', 'Night', 'very', 'underrated', 'comedian.-', 'Mr', 'Smith', 'Washington', 'similarities', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'superior', 'way', 'documentaries', 'tell', 'fact', 'was', 'originally', 'conceived', 'sequel', 'James', 'Stewart', 'much', 'more', 'convincing', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'yarn', 'far', 'more', 'tension', 'then', 'earlier', 'film', 'much', 'less', 'dated', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'release', 'Washington', 'where', 'depiction', 'political', 'corruption', 'was', 'considered', 'un-American', '.All', 'prints', 'are', 'good', 'happened', 'One', 'Night', 'suffers', 'grainy', 'scenes', 'films', 'benefit', 'Capra', 'attention', 'detail', 'particularly', 'character', 'actors', 'populated', 'films', 'documentaries', 'tell', 'actors', 'lived', 'appear', 'Capra', 'film', 'knew', 'even', 'smallest', 'part', 'would', 'be', 'treated', 'loving', 'attention', 'most', 'amusing', 'story', 'casting', 'Harry', 'Cary', 'Mr', 'Smith', 'Speaker', 'Senate', 'paper', 'part', 'was', 'minor', 'are', 'numerous', 'telling', 'close', 'ups', 'audience', 'reaction', 'what', 'happening', 'very', 'important', 'role.The', 'documentary', 'Capra', 'tells', 'beginnings', 'Italian', 'immigrant', 'Undoubtedly', 'own', 'rise', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'influenced', 'view', 'America', 'land', 'opportunity', 'depiction', 'power', 'people', 'lived', 'American', 'Dream', 'Even', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'idealism', 'expounded', 'most', 'films', 'Capra', 'corn', 'film', 'good', 'story', 'great', 'entertainment']",The Premiere Frank Capra Collection (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington / It Happened One Night / You Can't Take It with You / Mr. Deeds Goes to Town / American Madness / Frank Capra's American Dream)

1022134,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B000ION7A8,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[3, 3]","""It's a Wonderful Life"" is not only the best Frank Capra film, it's one of the best films ever. Some would want to limit to that to a genre, but if popularity counts for anything, it would be the people's choice. What's number two in the Caprian list? I'd say Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. In my view this Cooper vehicle is quite a bit better than Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, although in some ways they seem to be the same movie. But Capra arguably had one message, which he said over and over again. In Mr Deeds, he says it with wit and savvy. It's a plain man/ common man anthem that makes you rejoice to be alive.Longfellow Deeds is what Chesterton called ""another kind of priest"", a poet, and a particularly looked-down upon sort-- the sort that writes greeting cards and rhyming verse. Cooper's co-star is the unsinkable Jean Arthur. Modern audiences dismiss such films out of hand: they're black and white, for one thing; predictable for another; and the inevitable happy ending doesn't sit well in a cynical world. All that aside, as the people at the Library of Congress knew when they restored this film, and the people at Turner Classic Movies knew when they showed it, and which many viewers of this set know when they watch it, there are a lot of things going on here that are frankly dazzling, and in a filmic sense, for moderns tired of the switch it on, fast, hard, and, in its own way predictable modern fare of Hollywood, black and white is the new color.You Can't Take It With You plays well as a play, which is what it once was, and often is, as it remains one of the most popular comedies for small theater groups to put on, but it largely fails in this movie, for the same reason that many early cartoons similarly do. Both were made to fill their bill in the theater line-up (at a time when a newsreel and cartoon presented the feature film), and the fact of animation was dazzling enough on it's own without the later Disney innovation of a story line. In retrospect, this film would make a better musical, and I'm surprised someone hasn't redone it as one. Nevertheless, it provides yet another angle on Capra's populist dream at a time when the melting pot of America was sorely in need of an injection of celluloid hope.And humor. It Happened One Night is the quintessential screwball comedy, which the stylish Claudette Colbert was barely induced to play in. That already gives it a bit of a twist. Add the chemistry of Clark Gable who, again, was not entirely up for the film, and you get a spontaneity of the Buster Keaton sort without the spinning houses. TCM has a very deluxe package version of this film, but here one can see for oneself what the much-derided genre of screwball comedy was all about, with the result that one may just become an addict of it like this reviewer.If you like Capra at all,  you likely already own some version of It's a Wonderful Life, so here are a few more of his Cupid's arrows from the days when cinema had a heart, which just may make you fall in love with life all over again.",5,It's a Wonderful Set,1217116800,"07 27, 2008",2008,3041,"['Wonderful', 'Life', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'would', 'want', 'limit', 'genre', 'popularity', 'counts', 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'people', 'choice', 'What', 'number', 'two', 'Caprian', 'list', ""'d"", 'say', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'Goes', 'Town', 'view', 'Cooper', 'vehicle', 'quite', 'bit', 'better', 'Mr.', 'Smith', 'Goes', 'Washington', 'ways', 'seem', 'be', 'same', 'movie', 'Capra', 'arguably', 'had', 'one', 'message', 'said', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'Mr', 'Deeds', 'wit', 'savvy', 'plain', 'man/', 'common', 'man', 'rejoice', 'be', 'alive.Longfellow', 'Deeds', 'what', 'Chesterton', 'called', 'kind', 'priest', 'poet', 'particularly', 'looked-down', 'sort', 'sort', 'greeting', 'cards', 'rhyming', 'verse', 'Cooper', 'co-star', 'unsinkable', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'Modern', 'audiences', 'dismiss', 'such', 'films', 'hand', ""'re"", 'black', 'white', 'one', 'thing', 'predictable', 'inevitable', 'happy', 'ending', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'cynical', 'world', 'aside', 'people', 'Library', 'Congress', 'knew', 'when', 'restored', 'film', 'people', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'knew', 'when', 'showed', 'many', 'viewers', 'set', 'know', 'when', 'watch', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'going', 'here', 'are', 'frankly', 'dazzling', 'filmic', 'sense', 'moderns', 'tired', 'switch', 'fast', 'hard', 'own', 'way', 'predictable', 'modern', 'fare', 'Hollywood', 'black', 'white', 'new', 'color.You', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'plays', 'well', 'play', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'often', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'comedies', 'small', 'theater', 'groups', 'put', 'largely', 'movie', 'same', 'reason', 'many', 'early', 'cartoons', 'similarly', 'do', 'were', 'made', 'fill', 'bill', 'theater', 'line-up', 'time', 'when', 'newsreel', 'cartoon', 'presented', 'feature', 'film', 'fact', 'animation', 'was', 'dazzling', 'enough', 'own', 'later', 'Disney', 'innovation', 'story', 'line', 'retrospect', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'better', 'musical', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'someone', ""n't"", 'redone', 'one', 'Nevertheless', 'yet', 'angle', 'Capra', 'populist', 'dream', 'time', 'when', 'melting', 'pot', 'America', 'was', 'sorely', 'need', 'injection', 'celluloid', 'hope.And', 'humor', 'Happened', 'One', 'Night', 'quintessential', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'stylish', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'was', 'barely', 'induced', 'play', 'already', 'bit', 'twist', 'Add', 'chemistry', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'who', 'again', 'was', 'not', 'entirely', 'film', 'get', 'spontaneity', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'sort', 'spinning', 'houses', 'TCM', 'very', 'deluxe', 'package', 'version', 'film', 'here', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'much-derided', 'genre', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'was', 'result', 'one', 'may', 'just', 'become', 'addict', 'reviewer.If', 'Capra', 'likely', 'already', 'own', 'version', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'so', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'more', 'Cupid', 'arrows', 'days', 'when', 'cinema', 'had', 'heart', 'just', 'may', 'make', 'fall', 'love', 'life', 'over', 'again']",The Premiere Frank Capra Collection (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington / It Happened One Night / You Can't Take It with You / Mr. Deeds Goes to Town / American Madness / Frank Capra's American Dream)

Apparently, the heroes of my heroes turn out to be my heroes too.When watching this box, I vaguely remembered having seen some of those pictures as a boy in the '70s on television.  What a revelation to watch those pictures again, and becoming aware of the greatness of Capra.  Capra was an engineer, and began in Hollywood as a gagman.  He stepped up the ladder, and became the first director to win the five most important Oscars for one of his films (the romantic comedy ""It happened one night"", 1934).  He later on had his own studio, but that was one step beyond, although the name of his own studio revealed his political stand : LIBERTY STUDIOS !The pictures I most loved from this box have to do with it.  The liberty of moral choice : what would you do would you receive, out of the blue, an inheritance of 20 million dollars ?  (""Mr Deeds goes to town"", 1936).  And what has happened to our democratic liberties, what happened to the government of the people, by the people, and for the people ?  The political corruption has seldom been displayed so well as in ""Mr Smith goes to Washington"", 1939.But above all, Capra is a great moviemaker.  The message is an essential part, but you will watch witty dialogue, complex characters, great acting, smart storytelling, romance, hope and dreams.  And a laugh from time to time.  This is what movies are really about.  How great Capra was in his time, and how low Hollywood has sunk nowadays !  I am a fan, yes.

He warmed our hearts by trying to remind us that there is still good in the world.My personal favorite thing is the music.  Whether it was him personally or just the musicians he was fortunate enough to work with, the music in a Frank Capra film is astounding.

1022144,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000ION7A8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[72, 74]","Let's be honest--what movie-loving individual would dare to rank this collection of Capra classics at less than 5 stars?  It's inconceivable, especially with the noteworthy titles included in this handsome set.  As an early Christmas present to myself, I had to pick up this collection--I've been good this year.  I have, thus, been revisiting some of these all time greats.  Capra was an idealist, to be sure, and such wide-eyed optimism as a world view might be foreign to modern day audiences--but there is no denying the universal appeal inherent in the films of Frank Capra.  Long considered one our finest directors, Capra won three directing Oscars and all of those films are included here!""It Happened One Night"" is the quintessential screwball romantic comedy.  In 1934, it captured all 4 major Oscars--Film, Actor, Actress, and Director--and in history, that has only been done by two other films (""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"").  Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert shine in this great road-trip picture that seems remarkably progressive for its day.  This formula is often copied, but rarely equaled--this is probably the least dated film in the set.  ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,"" of course, is the classic tale of political endurance and ethics triumphing over corruption.  Still a powerful indictment and rousing drama, this is Jimmy Stewart in his most iconic performance.  ""You Can't Take It With You"" is another Best Picture and Director winner.  Starring Stewart, again, and Jean Arthur--this is a funny, but slight tale of a family of eccentrics teaching valuable life lessons to an uptight financier.  A great film for lovers of screwball wackiness, it might have lesser appeal to younger audiences as ""quirky"" is such an overdone modern movie device.  ""Mr. Deeds Goes To Town"" wraps up Capra's Best Director Oscars.  This classic stars Jean Arthur and Gary Cooper--who as Mr. Deeds wants to give away his inheritance to aid the nation's poor.  Idealistic and sweet, this shares a similar theme with the lesser know ""American Madness"" which is the fifth film in this box set.  An unlikely hero, Walter Huston as a bank president, uses his bank to fight against the Depression.  ""Deeds"" has the more enduring appeal, though, as this was a role that became closely identified with Cooper.  (Please disregard Adam Sandler's nightmare of the same title--it's not even appropriate to link it as a remake.)As if the films were not reward enough, this set also comes with the feature length documentary ""Frank Capra's American Dream"" hosted by Ron Howard.  Engaging and informative, many major directors (including Altman, Scorcese, Stone, etc.) weigh in with the impact Capra's work has had on them.  And if you want more, there's a 96 page movie scrapbook as well.Easily one of the greatest values for its price, I definitely recommend this set.  It is essential viewing for anyone who loves film!  The movies themselves will entertain and you'll learn a little bit about film history, too.

A Newman,"[27, 29]","It was a happy day for me when I learned that this collection was being isssued and when it arrived from Amazon my first act was to cancel all my appointments, take the phone off the hook and settle down with a bowl ofpopcorn and discover just what made Frank Capra one of the leading directors of his day and indeed for all time. I was not disappointed. Along with favorites like ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""You Can't Take it with You"" were ""It Happened One Night"" (which I had not seen in years and did not recall how good it was) and ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town."" Also included in this set is a fabulous collection of films documenting just how Frank Capra was able to produce his fabulous collection of films. It is rare that great classics of American cinema get the attention and treatment that they deserve, but this is one of those rare instances of the material being treated in the appropriate manner.It really would be silly for me to try to capture the magic and craftsmanship that went into making these fabulous films. Capra had a particular talent for being to tap into the fundamental aspects of what it meant to be an American in the 1930s and 1940s and this talent is on full display in this collection.  They contain some marvelous performances, particularly by Jimmy Stewart, Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Claudette Caulbert and in particular Jean Arthur.  While Capra's autobiography does contain it share of myths, the chapters that detail the efforts it took to get these performances down on film is probably worth consulting for the insights it provides.If I were to fault it for one or two things it would be the omission of two classics in the Capra canon.  These are ""Meet John Doe"" which really is crying out for a restoration and a proper release on DVD and ""It's a Wonderful Life."" These movies are probably excellent examples of Capra's creativity, but as this fine collection proves, they are by no means the only ones.I hope that other directors are in line for similar treatments in the future.

1022152,A2U974OZOVRT7A,B000ION7A8,Tom Without Pity,"[6, 6]","This is a review of the five film box set entitled THE PREMEIERE FRANK CAPRACOLLECTION released by Sony.  It contains five of Mr.Capra's biggest movies plusa bonus disc with a documentary entitled ""Frank Capra's American Dream.""The films included are:AMERICAN MADNESS (1932)  Walter Huston, Pat O'Brien, KayJohnson, Constance Cummings. Supposedly the only time Capra used asympathetic portrait of a banker, I guess savings and loan officials aren'tbankers, this is a really fine piece of movie artistry made just as  Caprareally found his voice and all the elements are already here.Beleagured hero saved by his own pluck and his many friends' willingness tobelieve in his honesty and acumen. Truly enjoyable, another Depression eraclassic...and still relevant today almost eighty years later.IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT(1934).  Clark Gable, Claudette Colbert,Walter Connoly, Rosco Karns. It's impossible to over- rate this comedyclassic, one fine scene after another. From a hitch hikiing tutorial todonut dunking lessons and learning the second chorus of ""The Man On theFlying Trapeze"" to discovering The Walls of Jericho this multi- Oscar winneras it all. Worth seeing many times over.MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN (1936). Gary Cooper, Jean Arthur,George Bancroft, Lionel Stander, Douglas Dumbrille. Frank Capra and writerRobert Risken hit thier stride with this Depression era comedy dramafeaturing wonderful performances by Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur. At thispoint Cooper almost didn't have to say anything, his facial expressions andbody language acted for him. Another marvelous film, one to watchrepeatedley.YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU (1938).  Jean Arthur, LionelBarrymore, James Stewart, Edward Arnold, Spring Byington. Film version of ahit Broadway play seems kind of flat to me. I thnk that it was filmed alittle late to be effective, again the Depression seems to hang over theproceedings despite the protagonsits insistance that they are going to gothrough life doing whatever they and the other household members want to do.That ideology does not include the two servants who are treated qiute wellalthough it's doubtful that they enjoy doing most of the laundry, cleaningand cooking, freeing everyone else to pursue their artistic careers. In anyevent, the big bad wolf comes knocking at the door and somehow everyone'sbacon is eventually saved.The weakest film in the five movie Capra box set but still interesting.MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON (1939).  James Stewart, JeanArthur, Thomas Mitchell, Claude Rains, Edward Arnold. A Capra milestone,controversial in its time as well as instructive and almost hopelesslyidealistic. A truly terrific film with great performances and chock full ofdrama and comedy as well as a bucket full of freshly popped ""Capra corn.""An important movie which presented a pretty fair picture of our democracy tothe world just before WWII broke out. Even places that didn't have electionsstill had greed and corruption and could understand and identify with ourproblems.Even the least of these movies is well worth seeing more than once and alsoincluded is a documentary entitled ""Frank Capra's American Dream,"" which justadds even more value to this excellent box set.You cannot go wrong with this fine collection of classic Capra.",5,FRANK CAPRA'S AMERICAN DREAM,1260144000,"12 7, 2009",2009,3262,"['review', 'five', 'film', 'box', 'set', 'entitled', 'THE', 'PREMEIERE', 'FRANK', 'CAPRACOLLECTION', 'released', 'Sony', 'five', 'Mr.Capra', 'biggest', 'movies', 'plusa', 'bonus', 'disc', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'American', 'Dream', 'films', 'included', 'are', 'AMERICAN', 'MADNESS', '1932', 'Walter', 'Huston', 'Pat', ""O'Brien"", 'KayJohnson', 'Constance', 'Cummings', 'Supposedly', 'only', 'time', 'Capra', 'used', 'asympathetic', 'portrait', 'banker', 'guess', 'savings', 'loan', 'officials', ""aren'tbankers"", 'really', 'fine', 'piece', 'movie', 'artistry', 'made', 'just', 'Caprareally', 'found', 'voice', 'elements', 'are', 'already', 'here.Beleagured', 'hero', 'saved', 'own', 'pluck', 'many', 'friends', 'willingness', 'tobelieve', 'honesty', 'acumen', 'Truly', 'enjoyable', 'Depression', 'eraclassic', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'almost', 'eighty', 'years', 'later.IT', 'HAPPENED', 'ONE', 'NIGHT', '1934', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Walter', 'Connoly', 'Rosco', 'Karns', 'impossible', 'over-', 'rate', 'comedyclassic', 'one', 'fine', 'scene', 'hitch', 'hikiing', 'tutorial', 'todonut', 'dunking', 'lessons', 'learning', 'second', 'chorus', 'Man', 'theFlying', 'Trapeze', 'discovering', 'Walls', 'Jericho', 'multi-', 'Oscar', 'winneras', 'Worth', 'seeing', 'many', 'times', 'over.MR', 'DEEDS', 'GOES', 'TO', 'TOWN', '1936', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'George', 'Bancroft', 'Lionel', 'Stander', 'Douglas', 'Dumbrille', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'writerRobert', 'Risken', 'hit', 'thier', 'stride', 'Depression', 'era', 'comedy', 'dramafeaturing', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'thispoint', 'Cooper', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'say', 'anything', 'facial', 'expressions', 'andbody', 'language', 'acted', 'marvelous', 'film', 'one', 'watchrepeatedley.YOU', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'TAKE', 'IT', 'WITH', 'YOU', '1938', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'LionelBarrymore', 'James', 'Stewart', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'Spring', 'Byington', 'Film', 'version', 'ahit', 'Broadway', 'play', 'kind', 'flat', 'thnk', 'was', 'filmed', 'alittle', 'late', 'be', 'effective', 'again', 'Depression', 'hang', 'over', 'theproceedings', 'protagonsits', 'insistance', 'are', 'going', 'gothrough', 'life', 'doing', 'other', 'household', 'members', 'want', 'do.That', 'ideology', 'not', 'include', 'two', 'servants', 'who', 'are', 'treated', 'qiute', 'doubtful', 'enjoy', 'doing', 'most', 'laundry', 'cleaningand', 'cooking', 'freeing', 'everyone', 'else', 'pursue', 'artistic', 'careers', 'anyevent', 'big', 'bad', 'wolf', 'knocking', 'door', 'somehow', ""everyone'sbacon"", 'eventually', 'saved.The', 'weakest', 'film', 'five', 'movie', 'Capra', 'box', 'set', 'still', 'interesting.MR', 'SMITH', 'GOES', 'TO', 'WASHINGTON', '1939', 'James', 'Stewart', 'JeanArthur', 'Thomas', 'Mitchell', 'Claude', 'Rains', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'A', 'Capra', 'milestone', 'controversial', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'instructive', 'almost', 'hopelesslyidealistic', 'truly', 'terrific', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'chock', 'full', 'ofdrama', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'bucket', 'full', 'freshly', 'popped', 'Capra', 'corn', 'important', 'movie', 'presented', 'pretty', 'fair', 'picture', 'democracy', 'tothe', 'world', 'just', 'WWII', 'broke', 'out', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'electionsstill', 'had', 'greed', 'corruption', 'could', 'understand', 'identify', 'ourproblems.Even', 'least', 'movies', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'more', 'once', 'alsoincluded', 'documentary', 'entitled', 'Frank', 'Capra', 'American', 'Dream', 'justadds', 'even', 'more', 'value', 'excellent', 'box', 'set.You', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', 'fine', 'collection', 'classic', 'Capra']",The Premiere Frank Capra Collection (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington / It Happened One Night / You Can't Take It with You / Mr. Deeds Goes to Town / American Madness / Frank Capra's American Dream)
1022153,A1RGTGCP7UG4ZA,B000ION7A8,Tony Marquise Jr.,"[1, 1]","Frank Capra was famous for an unrelated series of films that were described as Capracorn by many.  In these films an American 'everyman' took on the establishment and won.  He always got the girl and the love of what might be described as the crowd of unknown Americans- average citizens who had been given the short end of the stick in our society durring the depression.  This set contains his best films made while at Columbia Studio in his early days of directing.  These films, with my ratings, are 1. American Madness(3 stars), 2. It Happened One Night(5 stars), 3 Mr. Deeds Goes to Town(4 stars), 4. You Can't Take It with You(4 stars), and 5. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington(5 stars).  This set also has a DVD with some excellant extras on it.  The best movie in this set is It Happened One Night-the best love story ever put on film.  Mr. Smith Goes To Washington is the best film about the way American politics should be every made.  Even American Madness, the movie I rated lowest in this set, is enjoyable.
