He wasnt really an outkast but rebellious and it did accuratly portray the groups and how they compared them with sheep and it was pretty funny. The movie wasnt brilliant- it is somewhat forgetable but the story was ok to watch. Melissa John Heart plays a preppy girl who gives a makeover to the school's rebellious guy to transform him into a preppy kid to make his ex girlfriend and her ex boyfriend jealous.( the guy was cute to begin with but they just made him into a prep)- Then they end up together at the end and thats about it. Like i said its enjoyable to watch but forgetable- Only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it is accurate portrayal of some cliches in high school and how they act.

476750,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6305761213,"""flickjunkie""","[1, 1]","This romantic comedy is a likeable, though predictable teen flick.  Actually, as high school fare goes, this is pretty wholesome.  Of the three major teen staples, there is very little in the way of sex and drugs, but  plenty of rock and roll.  The story revolves around a girl and boy who are  next door neighbors.  Though they have known each other their whole lives,  they travel in very different circles at school.  She is very ""in"", popular  and active.  He is very ""out"", rebellious and counterculture.  When each of  them gets rejected by their love interests, they form an unlikely alliance  to make the rejecters jealous.  They pretend they are now dating, to the  amazement of all their friends.But be careful what you wish for,  because you might get it.  Surprising to no-one in the audience, they  actually fall for one another.  This complicates matters when the scam  works and their respective love interests re-ignite and take up hot  pursuit.  Not the most original story line, but it sets up some funny skits  especially with the characters' attempts to adapt to the formerly rejected  culture of the other.  The writing has some good lines and the romance  between Nicole (Melissa Joan Hart) and Chase (Adrian Grenier) works well.  These two have good chemistry and seem to genuinely like each other.The  ending is upbeat, and overall this is a feel good movie.  The acting, as is  always the case in these movies, was not so much acting as teens portraying  themselves.  Melissa Joan Hart has been playing a teenager since 1992, and  at 24 it is probably time to move on.  As probably the most experienced  actor in the film, she played the part very well and was one of the few  players who actually had to do some acting outside the stereotype.  Adrian  Grenier, (also 24), held down the male lead well, although he was much more  convincing once he was ""in"" than as a rebellious outsider.All in all, it  was a sprightly and entertaining entry into a crowded genre.  I gave it a  7/10.

476760,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,6305761213,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[19, 22]","Isn't it funny how some films don't quite fit their stereotypes? I settled down to watch Drive Me Crazy because I was in the mood to watch a mindless teen movie, and given that this film stars Melissa Joan Hart of Sabrina The Teen Witch fame, I was expecting really more of the same. It doesn't help that the beginning of the film reinforces the stereotype (complete with cheesy pop background music, neon-lit opening titles and slow pan across a typical teenage girl's bedroom followed by Melissa answering the phone in her best ""a la Sabrina"" perky voice).What I encountered was a film that is still very much rooted in the teen ""prom"" genre, but is slightly deeper and sophisticated (as well as more ponderous and slow-moving) than I expected. It's quite a biting and penetrating observation of the high school social hierarchy as well as the conflicting emotions of young love. Think of it as a more serious version of Clueless with a dash of Dangerous Liaisons thrown in.Nicole Maris (Melissa Joan Hart) is a pretty and popular girl at the Timothy Zonin High School (definitely in the ""in"" crowd) who is organising a big formal dance celebrating the centenary anniversary of her school. She has the hots for school basketball star Brad (Gabriel Carpenter) and hopes he will be her date for the dance.Neighbour and fellow classmate Chase Hammon (Adrian Grenier) is on the other side of the school social stratum. Sporting a ""rebel without a cause"" attitude and a grungy appearance, he hangs out with nerdy Ray (Kris Park) and ""Designated Dave"" (Mark Webber) - the latter so-nicknamed because he doesn't drink therefore he always chauffeurs the other kids when they are blind drunk and want to go back home after a party. At the beginning of the film, the three of them (masterminded by Chase) stage a prank involving putting coloured dye into the school sprinkler system which nearly gets them suspended.Incidentally, Nicole and Chase used to be childhood friends but then grew apart into their different ways. Both have single parents (William Converse-Roberts as Mr. Hammond and Faye Grant as Mrs. Maris) as Chase's mum died of cancer and Nicole's father (Stephen Collins) is estranged. Their parents appear to be very ""friendly"" with each other, and later on in the film we find out why.So, when Brad - on the verge of asking Nicole to the centenary dance - falls in love with a cheerleader instead (when he accidentally fell on her during a basketball game), and Chase's girlfriend Dulcie (Ali Larter) dumps him because she thinks he's too shallow (because she is into animal rights and he doesn't seem to be interested), Nicole and Chase strike an unholy deal - they will pretend to be in a relationship with each other in an attempt to make their desired partners jealous.Nicole gives Chase a Pygmalion-like makeover and suddenly it looks like their crazy plan may just succeed after all. Or will they fall in love with each other instead? And what about Nicole's best friend - acid-tongued Alicia (Susan May Pratt) - will she throw a spanner into the works?The ending may be somewhat predictable, and yet the film as a whole seems to be more than the sum of its parts. The characters are reasonably fleshed out and have complex overtones to their personalities, and the dialogue is reasonably clever in places.

476766,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305761213,Matthew Horner,"[2, 2]","Drave Me Crazy had the misfortune of arriving in a year when, as Roger Ebert noted, six or eight movies with the same plot were released. You know the one. Cute boy and adorable girl go to hell and back trying to get the perfect date for the prom, when we all know they are going to wind up with each other. So it's no surprise that Drive Me Crazy tanked, as they say. Even the most innocent teenagers had reached their cute quotient. That's too bad, because this movie may be the best of the lot, which is to say that it's pretty darn good, as opposed to really good.Chase and Nicole [Adrian Greer and Melissa Joan Hart] grew up next door to each other. He lives with his Dad, who is widowed, and she with her Mother, who is divorced. As kids, they were best friends. When they hit adolescence, they drifted apart. She opted to become a model high school student with lots of normal friends. He became a rebel and a leader of the fringe group. Today she is on the planning committee for Centennial [at least the writers changed the big event from being just a prom]. He couldn't care less about such things. When he is dumped by his very attractive girlfriend and she fails to entice the local jock/hunk into inviting her to the party, Chase and Nicole join forces. They decide that they will pretend to be a couple. Surely this will get the attention of the real objects of their desires. Of course, we know different.Everyone should recognize Melissa Joan Hart, who is TV's Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. She doesn't do any great acting stretches here, but she's awfully pleasant to watch. To quote another critic, she's on the fast track to becoming this generation's Doris Day. That's not Oscar-winning territory, but it's still a good place to be. With his dark good looks and those sleepy eyes, Adrian Greer makes a refreshing change from your usual clone-a-star types. He may not turn out to be &quot;A&quot; picture star material, but who knows? It's a fact he can act.There are problems with Drive Me Crazy, but the star couple is not one of them. They're a great duo. The problems are with the script, which never ventures outside of its rather bland perspective. As a rebel, Chance is completely harmless, and his sudden transformation into Mr. Middle of the Road is not very believable. The minor characters are interesting, but nothing is done with them story-wise, except for Nicole's father. One day he realizes that he has truly neglected her. He takes her for a ride in his hot-air balloon. In midair, he hands her copy of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, assuring her that it will help her understand him. She throws the book overboard. End of discussion. It's a clever scene and a wonderful way to show him [and us] just how much he needs to make up to her. A few more vignettes like this one would have really helped the movie. As it is, Drive Me Crazy makes for an enjoyable evening of very light entertainment which neither insults nor lowers your intelligence.",3,"Light entertainment, great fun",1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,2991,"['Drave', 'Me', 'Crazy', 'had', 'misfortune', 'arriving', 'year', 'when', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'noted', 'six', 'eight', 'movies', 'same', 'plot', 'were', 'released', 'know', 'one', 'Cute', 'boy', 'adorable', 'girl', 'go', 'hell', 'back', 'trying', 'get', 'perfect', 'date', 'prom', 'when', 'know', 'are', 'going', 'wind', 'up', 'other', 'surprise', 'Drive', 'Me', 'Crazy', 'tanked', 'say', 'Even', 'most', 'innocent', 'teenagers', 'had', 'reached', 'cute', 'quotient', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'lot', 'say', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'opposed', 'really', 'good.Chase', 'Nicole', '[', 'Adrian', 'Greer', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', ']', 'grew', 'up', 'next', 'door', 'other', 'Dad', 'who', 'widowed', 'Mother', 'who', 'divorced', 'kids', 'were', 'best', 'friends', 'When', 'hit', 'adolescence', 'drifted', 'apart', 'opted', 'become', 'model', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'lots', 'normal', 'friends', 'became', 'rebel', 'leader', 'fringe', 'group', 'Today', 'planning', 'committee', 'Centennial', '[', 'least', 'writers', 'changed', 'big', 'event', 'being', 'just', 'prom', ']', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'such', 'things', 'When', 'dumped', 'very', 'attractive', 'girlfriend', 'entice', 'local', 'jock/hunk', 'inviting', 'party', 'Chase', 'Nicole', 'join', 'forces', 'decide', 'will', 'pretend', 'be', 'couple', 'Surely', 'will', 'get', 'attention', 'real', 'objects', 'desires', 'course', 'know', 'different.Everyone', 'should', 'recognize', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'who', 'TV', 'Sabrina', 'Teenage', 'Witch', ""n't"", 'do', 'great', 'acting', 'stretches', 'here', 'awfully', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'quote', 'critic', 'fast', 'track', 'becoming', 'generation', 'Doris', 'Day', 'not', 'Oscar-winning', 'territory', 'still', 'good', 'place', 'be', 'dark', 'good', 'looks', 'sleepy', 'eyes', 'Adrian', 'Greer', 'refreshing', 'change', 'usual', 'clone-a-star', 'types', 'may', 'not', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'quot', 'A', 'quot', 'picture', 'material', 'who', 'fact', 'can', 'act.There', 'are', 'problems', 'Drive', 'Me', 'Crazy', 'star', 'couple', 'not', 'one', ""'re"", 'great', 'duo', 'problems', 'are', 'script', 'never', 'ventures', 'rather', 'bland', 'perspective', 'rebel', 'Chance', 'completely', 'harmless', 'sudden', 'transformation', 'Mr.', 'Middle', 'Road', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'nothing', 'done', 'story-wise', 'Nicole', 'father', 'One', 'day', 'truly', 'neglected', 'ride', 'hot-air', 'balloon', 'midair', 'copy', 'Zen', 'Art', 'Motorcycle', 'Maintenance', 'assuring', 'will', 'help', 'understand', 'book', 'overboard', 'End', 'discussion', 'clever', 'scene', 'wonderful', 'way', 'show', '[', ']', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'make', 'up', 'few', 'more', 'vignettes', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'helped', 'movie', 'Drive', 'Me', 'Crazy', 'enjoyable', 'evening', 'very', 'light', 'entertainment', 'insults', 'lowers', 'intelligence']",Drive Me Crazy VHS

Melissa Joan Hart proves she cannot carry a movie (at least not until she improves her acting skills).  Her performance is plastic, flat, and totally lacking.  It's no different than anything she has done in the past.  Watch an episode of Clarissa and/or Sabrina and then this movie and there is no difference at all in her performance (except, perhaps that her clothes are more revealing).&quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot; doesn't seem to know where it wants to go as a story either (did Hart write the movie too?).  It meanders about, seemingly with no direction or purpose.  Is it going to be a satirical commentary on high school life?  Is it going to address the disappointments a young person faces when an absentee parent turns out to be a total flake?  Is it going to address the turmoil a young person feels when a loved one passes away?  WHAT?!  It doesn't have to serve any purpose other than to be a fun teen flick, but it should at least do that well.The only redeeming quality of this movie is co-star Adrian Grenier.

Cos it has a track by what used to be one of my fave bands for years on the soundtrack (Steps ""One For Sorrow""), I was interested to see if Melissa Joan Hart can do any other character apart from Clarissa and Sabrina (I grew up with this girl, and she can't), and for the Britney video to ""Drive Me Crazy"". Otherwise, I have a penchant for these rom-coms set in high schools.I grew up watching Melissa in kids TV, first on Clarissa and then on Sabrina. When you're young, you don't really notice the acting, but in this, you really do notice how bad she is. Like most TV actors trying to move into movies, they don't really try too hard to move away from the character they've been playing for years. She goes through the motions, and most of her laughter, and OTT-ness is fake.Another thing is most of the time, these movies have drop-dead gorgeous stars. Adrian Grenier?! Who is he exactly? He's not good-looking - or he doesn't appeal to me - and he's just not right for that role.Ali Larter appears in this, the girl with the ever-changing hair colour, and the film actually looked up by having her in it. She's a great actress, and with the wacky hair colouring (every shade of pink, red and purple you can think of) and styles. It's worthwhile getting this movie purely for her.The extras aren't up to much, apart from the Britney video - I love that song. You've got the usual theatrical trailer, various TV spots, and two music videos.There's nothing special about this teen rom-com. It's never properly explained why the two main characters gave up speaking to each ""it's called junior high"", or why they were too shallow to even bother to keep up the friendship.

476779,A243HY69GIAHFI,6305761213,tropic_of_criticism,"[12, 15]","Hardly a waste of time, DRIVE ME CRAZY isn't quite the movie it was marketed to be.  Though presented as a romantic comedy, this is a film essentially about cliques, and the almost tribal warfare that ensues between them.  More, it's about stepping outside the familiar and seeing what else there is to life.  To be sure you won't be magically transported by this film to some greater understanding of high school life.  But it does have the capacity to make you remember what it feels like to be in (a predominantly white, suburban American) high school.Is it funny?  Well, it's no AMERICAN PIE.  There are moments of humor, but you won't be bustin' a gut, here.  It is, however, absolutely fun.  This is definitely a movie for those nights where you don't want to be challenged, but you equally don't want to be insulted by blatant stereotype.Oh, yes, it IS a love story.  But it's the social commentary and the characters' felt angst along the way that makes you keep watching.  The acting in almost every case contributes greatly to this need to stay tuned.  Others have commented that Melissa Joan Hart is laughable here, but I don't see that.  She perfectly captures a girl on the cool side of preppy.If there's anything unsatisfying here, it's that the tension which builds between the two leads never sees real resolution.  The pre-ordained ending simply happens.  Though that ending makes sense, we're missing about one scene of confrontation in which that resolution can be worked out.  Also, unlike AMERICAN PIE which is very clearly told from the perspective of teenagers, this film throughout feels as though it's made by adults trying to recreate their youths.  This makes the film somewhat purer and less offensive than AMERICAN PIE, but it does take a great deal of that frenetic, sexual `edge' off.These qualifications aside, DRIVE ME CRAZY is still worth a look, and maybe even a ponder or two.[DVD NOTES: There's really nothing much extra on the DVD.  Unless you just really like adding indiscriminately to your DVD collection, you should probably save a few dollars and get it on VHS.]",4,"Dumb title, good movie",974246400,"11 15, 2000",2000,2105,"['Hardly', 'waste', 'time', 'DRIVE', 'ME', 'CRAZY', ""n't"", 'quite', 'movie', 'was', 'marketed', 'be', 'Though', 'presented', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'film', 'essentially', 'cliques', 'almost', 'tribal', 'warfare', 'More', 'stepping', 'familiar', 'seeing', 'what', 'else', 'life', 'be', 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'magically', 'transported', 'film', 'greater', 'understanding', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'have', 'capacity', 'make', 'remember', 'what', 'be', 'predominantly', 'white', 'suburban', 'American', 'high', 'school.Is', 'Well', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'are', 'moments', 'humor', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'bustin', 'gut', 'here', 'however', 'absolutely', 'fun', 'definitely', 'movie', 'nights', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'challenged', 'equally', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'insulted', 'blatant', 'stereotype.Oh', 'yes', 'love', 'story', 'social', 'commentary', 'characters', 'felt', 'angst', 'way', 'keep', 'watching', 'acting', 'almost', 'case', 'greatly', 'need', 'stay', 'tuned', 'Others', 'have', 'commented', 'Melissa', 'Joan', 'Hart', 'laughable', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'perfectly', 'girl', 'cool', 'side', 'preppy.If', 'anything', 'unsatisfying', 'here', 'tension', 'two', 'leads', 'never', 'sees', 'real', 'resolution', 'pre-ordained', 'ending', 'simply', 'ending', 'sense', ""'re"", 'missing', 'one', 'scene', 'confrontation', 'resolution', 'can', 'be', 'worked', 'out', 'Also', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'very', 'clearly', 'told', 'perspective', 'teenagers', 'film', 'feels', 'made', 'adults', 'trying', 'recreate', 'youths', 'film', 'somewhat', 'purer', 'less', 'offensive', 'AMERICAN', 'PIE', 'take', 'great', 'deal', 'frenetic', 'sexual', 'edge', 'off.These', 'qualifications', 'aside', 'DRIVE', 'ME', 'CRAZY', 'still', 'worth', 'look', 'maybe', 'even', 'ponder', 'two', '[', 'DVD', 'NOTES', 'really', 'nothing', 'much', 'extra', 'DVD', 'Unless', 'just', 'really', 'like', 'adding', 'indiscriminately', 'DVD', 'collection', 'should', 'probably', 'save', 'few', 'dollars', 'get', 'VHS', ']']",Drive Me Crazy VHS

There was a good array of characters and the two lead characters, Melissa Joan Hart as Nicole and Adrian Grenier as Chase, worked well together. There are a lot of new young actors in these movies, like Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and their performances are usually outstanding. There is one poignant scene between Chase and is old girlfriend, Dulcie (Ali Larter) and the director John Schultz captured one of the most dramatic moments in cinema since Paul Henreid and Bette Davis in Now, Voyager. Anyway, Dulcie strolls into her favorite bar/hangout with Chase, but wait, he stops at the door, reluctant to go in. He looks around at the place and he begins to think that this is not the life he wants. He knows there are better places to hang, better people to be with and so he watches Dulcie pony up to the bar among the crowd. She turns and suddenly realizes Chase is not next to her, her eyes look away for a moment and when her eyes move to lock onto his, they begin to well up with tears and they are both communicating without a single word. It's a jewel of a moment for a director and for these young talented actors.
