The weekly series that followed wasn't well-received by comparison.  I'm not sure why that is, as it was a reasonably well-made, action-packed continuation of the story.The first dozen or so episodes were the best, as Marc Singer's Mike Donovan looked for his son while trying to hold together the rag-tag band of resistance fighters.  Along with Faye Grant as Juliet Parish and the ever-imposing Michael Ironside as Ham Tyler, Singer helped carry the episodes.  But around episode 12 (it's been awhile, so forgive me if I'm off by one or so) about the half the cast was written out, including Ironside.  The remaining episodes degenerated in quality, but the final cliffhanger (the NEVER RESOLVED cliffhanger) was very exciting.""V"" originally conceived as a WWII allegory; the weekly show, while perhaps omitting some of the more intellectual and philosophical beats, still stands up as a well-made bit of action/sci-fi.

822333,A19HQVND02SRWE,B00023BKMC,Alan,"[5, 8]","When this series first aired, I was in 6th grade and it was my favorite show.  I loved it, I looked forward to it every Friday, and was disappointed whenever it wouldn't be on for whatever reason.Watching it now, however, I have a different opinion.  I actually had to force myself to finish watching the entire series once I started.  Inane plots, stock footage re-used ad nauseum, cliched characters...and what has got to be the weirdest Christmas episode in the history of television.  Michael Ironside's ""Ham Tyler"" character, perhaps the most interesting in the series, leaves halfway through.  And then there's the issue of the 3rd episode, which NBC refused to air during the original run due to the violence it contained (they later aired at in the summer, after the show had been cancelled and the finale aired).  The problem is that this episode contained the first meeting of Kyle Bates and the resistance.  By refusing to air this episode, the first meeting didn't take place -- so they ""met for the first time"" again in episode 4!  Watching these episodes in sequence is definitely strange -- even some of the dialog during the meeting is the same (""I used to work for a man named Bates."").  But as far as continuity goes, it seems like they couldn't make up their minds whether or not episode 3 ""happened"" or not -- some elements of episode 4 are continuous with episode 3, while others seem to disregard it completely.By the end of the series, it's all a mess.  I will say that I think the first two episodes are okay, but after that, it devolves into typical 1980's fare.If you're interested in V, I'd recommend checking out the superior original mini-series, or the less cerebral follow-up, ""V: The Final Battle"".",2,"They could've called it ""V: Enough Already""",1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,1730,"['When', 'series', 'first', 'aired', 'was', '6th', 'grade', 'was', 'favorite', 'show', 'loved', 'looked', 'forward', 'Friday', 'was', 'disappointed', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'reason.Watching', 'now', 'however', 'have', 'different', 'opinion', 'actually', 'had', 'force', 'finish', 'watching', 'entire', 'series', 'started', 'Inane', 'plots', 'stock', 'footage', 're-used', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'cliched', 'characters', 'got', 'be', 'weirdest', 'Christmas', 'episode', 'history', 'television', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'Ham', 'Tyler', 'character', 'perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'series', 'halfway', 'then', 'issue', '3rd', 'episode', 'NBC', 'refused', 'air', 'original', 'run', 'due', 'violence', 'contained', 'later', 'aired', 'summer', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'cancelled', 'finale', 'aired', 'problem', 'episode', 'contained', 'first', 'meeting', 'Kyle', 'Bates', 'resistance', 'refusing', 'air', 'episode', 'first', 'meeting', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'met', 'first', 'time', 'again', 'episode', '4', 'Watching', 'episodes', 'sequence', 'definitely', 'strange', 'even', 'dialog', 'meeting', 'same', 'used', 'work', 'man', 'named', 'Bates.', 'as', 'far', 'continuity', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'minds', 'not', 'episode', '3', 'happened', 'not', 'elements', 'episode', '4', 'are', 'continuous', 'episode', '3', 'others', 'seem', 'disregard', 'end', 'series', 'mess', 'will', 'say', 'think', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'are', 'okay', 'typical', '1980', 'fare.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'V', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'checking', 'superior', 'original', 'mini-series', 'less', 'cerebral', 'follow-up', 'V', 'Final', 'Battle']",N/A

822338,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00023BKMC,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[0, 0]","V: The Original TV Series appeared in 1994, preparing to cash in on the success of V: The Original Miniseries and its sequel, V: The Final Battle.  Apparently, the final conflict wasn't so final after all, as the red dust created by the resistance to destroy the Visitors turned out to be only partially successful.  The result was that there are certain areas of the planet wound up being unsafe to the Visitors (until they created an antidote, of course), while elsewhere, open war between the resistance and the Visitors wages on.  So is the setup for the transition from the miniseries to the television show.  Returning are Mike, Julie, Ham, and Willie for the resistance; they are joined by Robin and her daughter, the ""star-child,"" Elizabeth, now a young woman.  New characters introduced for the TV series include Nathan Bates, a businessman who dares to bargain with the Visitors to keep Los Angeles a neutral zone, and his estranged son, Kyle.  And, of course, we still have Visitor vixen and everyone's favorite villain, Diana, as well as her nemesis, Lydia.For the first ten episodes or so, all of the above actually works okay.  Sure, the acting performances by both Marc Singer and Michael Ironside are a bit over-the-top, but that's part of what made the first two miniseries fun, right?  The Bates character--along with his sidekick, the ever-present Mr. Chiang--is a worthwhile addition; Lane Smith could have given Larry Hagman a run for his money back in the day.  There are a few things that are a bit annoying, such as Robin's whining or the fact that Willie STILL can't seem to learn the language.  But overall, the plotlines of these episodes are still interesting and enjoyable.  By around Episode 12, however, the show really takes a turn for the worse.  At this point, several of the main characters are suddenly dismissed (through both death and other departures), which has a severe negative impact.  Furthermore, much of the action shifts away from the resistance movement and to Mothership, focusing instead on politics amongst the Visitors themselves.  In this way, the series loses much of its effectiveness, and it slowly peters out to a quite unsatisfying conclusion.Although I was in high school at the time of V's original release and was definitely aware of its popularity, I never watched either the miniseries or the television series before now.  The miniseries--both the original and The Final Battle--I enjoyed; although they were campy and overdone, they were also entertaining and fun.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the TV series.  The first 10 or so episodes on this DVD are worthy of three stars, but the last nine really don't deserve more than two.  Overall, I would be hesitant to recommend this DVD; unless you are a die-hard V fan who MUST see everything, I would suggest sticking with the two very good miniseries only.",3,Not nearly as entertaining as the two miniseries that preceeded it,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,2882,"['V', 'Original', 'TV', 'Series', 'appeared', '1994', 'preparing', 'cash', 'success', 'V', 'Original', 'Miniseries', 'sequel', 'V', 'Final', 'Battle', 'Apparently', 'final', 'conflict', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'final', 'red', 'dust', 'created', 'resistance', 'destroy', 'Visitors', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'only', 'partially', 'successful', 'result', 'was', 'are', 'certain', 'areas', 'planet', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'unsafe', 'Visitors', 'created', 'antidote', 'course', 'elsewhere', 'open', 'war', 'resistance', 'Visitors', 'wages', 'setup', 'transition', 'miniseries', 'television', 'show', 'Returning', 'are', 'Mike', 'Julie', 'Ham', 'Willie', 'resistance', 'are', 'joined', 'Robin', 'daughter', 'star-child', 'Elizabeth', 'now', 'young', 'woman', 'New', 'characters', 'introduced', 'TV', 'series', 'include', 'Nathan', 'Bates', 'businessman', 'who', 'bargain', 'Visitors', 'keep', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'neutral', 'zone', 'estranged', 'son', 'Kyle', 'course', 'still', 'have', 'Visitor', 'vixen', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'villain', 'Diana', 'as', 'well', 'nemesis', 'Lydia.For', 'first', 'ten', 'episodes', 'so', 'above', 'actually', 'okay', 'Sure', 'acting', 'performances', 'Marc', 'Singer', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'are', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'two', 'miniseries', 'fun', 'right', 'Bates', 'character', 'sidekick', 'ever-present', 'Mr.', 'Chiang', 'worthwhile', 'addition', 'Lane', 'Smith', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'Larry', 'Hagman', 'run', 'money', 'back', 'day', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'bit', 'annoying', 'such', 'Robin', 'whining', 'fact', 'Willie', 'STILL', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'learn', 'language', 'overall', 'plotlines', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'Episode', '12', 'however', 'show', 'really', 'turn', 'worse', 'point', 'several', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'suddenly', 'dismissed', 'death', 'other', 'departures', 'severe', 'negative', 'impact', 'Furthermore', 'much', 'action', 'away', 'resistance', 'movement', 'Mothership', 'focusing', 'instead', 'politics', 'amongst', 'Visitors', 'way', 'series', 'much', 'effectiveness', 'slowly', 'out', 'quite', 'unsatisfying', 'conclusion.Although', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'time', 'V', 'original', 'release', 'was', 'definitely', 'aware', 'popularity', 'never', 'watched', 'miniseries', 'television', 'series', 'now', 'miniseries', 'original', 'Final', 'Battle', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'campy', 'overdone', 'were', 'also', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'Unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'TV', 'series', 'first', '10', 'so', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'are', 'worthy', 'three', 'stars', 'last', 'nine', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'more', 'two', 'Overall', 'would', 'be', 'hesitant', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'are', 'die-hard', 'V', 'fan', 'who', 'MUST', 'see', 'everything', 'would', 'suggest', 'sticking', 'two', 'very', 'good', 'miniseries', 'only']",N/A
822339,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B00023BKMC,blackaciddevil,"[0, 0]","Following hot on the heels of both TV miniseries, V became a TV show on NBC. Due to budgetary constraints and the fact the show lacked direction without Kenneth Johnson, the show only lasted 19 episodes. The cancellation of the show appeared to have caught its' producers by surprise as the show ends in a cliffhanger. So, if you get this hoping for some closure to the story, you're going to be surprised. Thankfully, all the cast members from the original series and its' sequel returned for the show. The story itself picks up directly after V:The Final Battle. Diana escapes from her captured mothership in a shuttle but is pursued by Donovan. The two engage in combat and Donovan successfully shoots her down, capturing her. Diana is put on trial for the acts she committed during the First Invasion.  Nathan Bates, the CEO of Science Frontiers(the company responsible for production of the Red Dust), arranges to have Diana publicly assasinated. Secretly, they take her to a cabin outside the woods in LA. Nathan offers Diana better accommodations for helping solve problems on Earth by providing Visitor technological expertiese. Donovan and Martin, having witnessed her assassination, sense something isn't right and pursue the agents who supposedly kill her. Upon reaching the cabin, Donovan is knocked unconscious by Martin. Martin wants Diana dead. Before he can kill her, though, Diana is able to steal his pistol. She forces him to surrender his last antidote pill so she can temporarily survive on Earth and shoots him, thus making her escape to the Southwest Tracking Station. That's basically where things start.Overall, it is a good show. Well worth getting if you've purchased both miniseries, for sure.

That's a minor complaint though, and I only mention it for the purists who would not want to buy the series knowing the teasers are omitted.Visually, the episodes appear to be of pretty good picture quality, but do not appear to have had any special re-mastering done to them.

822344,A3H4TIVTTA5IBB,B00023BKMC,Brian A. Wolters,"[61, 63]","V: The Series was a very odd television show. On one hand, The Final Battle ended and it was a very satisfying end to the 10 hour miniseries. But this weekly series did actually made some interesting points to the ongoing story but it was soon abandoned as well as most of the originally cohesive cast.The series starts out about a year later and we soon see that Diana and the fleet wants revenge over the red dust. As we soon find out, the dust is harmful to people and really can't be used anymore and the visitors patiently wait for the dusts effects to cease. This sets up many good episodes about the visitors regaining control. However, gone is the Nazi allegory and it therefore goes for power and corruption plots all the while the resistance is back to fight the Visitor's once again.I found myself really enjoying the first several episodes. The acting was solid, Diana was as nasty as ever and they took chances and killed off regulars and that added to the dramatic impact. The Nathan Bates subplots were actually interesting and you really began to hate Mr. Chang. Michael Ironside was also very fun to watch. And the ""soap opera"" of ""Charles and Diana"" was also very entertaining.However, as it went on toward midseason, the series started falling apart by the seams. The idea of the resistance always winning and episodes ending with showing Diana dejected began to run thin. They just beat us over the head with Willy and his butchering of the English language, which is a shame, because he was such a charming character and performed well. The special effects were reused over and over again. The campiness factor of eating rodents was way over done and all originality that they could have tried for just went away.Then, when we get the new credit sequence, the show pretty much became a chore to sit through. Gone are some of the better and well acted characters. And the plots became paper thin and were filled with ""filler"" scenes where you just feel they were making it up as they went along. Add in ""romantic flashback"" scenes, illogical situations, cheesy actors making guest appearances and you can see that because of the daring chances they took with the series at the first, they were left with pretty much nothing. The acting also suffered, especially Faye Grant, in which she gave very uneven performances toward the end, especially in the dreadful episode ""The Secret Underground"". That episode was the worst in the entire run. The show ended with the Episode ""The Return"" and it actually felt like it would redeem itself but by then, it was too late. There was no saving ""V.""This DVD collection of V: The Series is no frills. They put episodes on both sides of the DVD, making this a 3 DVD collection. Box is nice looking with good shots of some of the cast but nothing extra comes with it. The picture and sound quality of this collection is about as good as you would expect from an early 80's show.I had a good time with this series and it was fun to see how it played out up to the unresolved cliffhanger.

822349,A21VGNU5959O85,B00023BKMC,CaterpillarGirl,"[17, 17]","Being a child of the 80's, and that doesn't mean I was born in that time it means I GREW UP in it (born 1973), meaning I was conscience of what was going on around me, and old enough to retain all the cultural stimulus it had to offer in TV, Music, Movies and Trends. One of the most memorable events was watching V, from its first miniseries, to the final battle to the short lived series I was a serious fan. From then until now I list it in my top 10 favorite TV shows of all time. My sister and I would play V, I would always be the Star child, and she would be Diana, and I once even had a cat with a skin problem who I named Diana because it was a bit scaly.The Miniseries and The Final battle were excellent pieces of TV, although they are admittedly cheesy at times, and to our eyes now they seem so B-movie under budget effects, those shows still work for us just as much as they did back then. The Series that followed unfortunately contained little of the excitement and originality that the others do.There are many problems in this series, too many to ignore.1) They show the same footage over and over again, as if we cannot recognize that they have used it before. The flying of the skyfighters over the city or country shooting at each other was from the other series, and so was Mike on horseback, they also showed the same footage of the visitors checking out the same van twice on two different episodes. The inside shots of the Mothership, as well as the shuttles going in or out is all recycled and quite frankly it ruins the momentum of the show.2) The visitors eating habits, okay they eat meat, they are here to eat us right? But every Visitor party on the mother ship was a buffet of parakeets, mice, and spiders where was the human steaks? We get that they like mice, yet they had to show the same Gag over and over again ""mouse being lifted up, shoot away, mouse in mouth, omg they are eating mice"" whatever. In one shot, they show a bowl of worms and the one on top is a freaking gummi worm for the actor to eat. Yes it's that obvious.3) In Nathan Bates Office he has a ""plasma ball"" the kind you buy at Spencer's in the mall, its plainly displayed as if to say ""look I am high tech"" Later, the ball shows up on the Mother Ship and it is used as a communication device to speak to the leader, they even use Star Trek sound effects for it. No lie. Along those same lines, Nathan Bates office doubles as a ""computer lab"" in one episode.4) A microphone is clear as day when Elizabeth, Phillip, Willie, Mike and Julie are trying to get through a door on the last episode, right before the black light effect it's in the upper left hand corner. Also when there is an explosion on the mother ship behind a door, you can see someone spraying smoke up and down to create the effect.5) Mike Donovan has countless ""unnecessary"" stunts like: running then rolling on the ground, jumping on top of cars and sliding, rolling than shooting. At one point in the end him and Julie and Kyle and Willie are running from Lt. James, the rest of them are behind a parked car, Mike runs towards them.....and jumps on the hood sliding into place, the shot pans out and there is no apparent reasoning for him to have just done that, you really want Kyle to say ""okay Donovan  that was completely unnecessary""6) The resistance has serious problems killing the visitors in close combat, yet they killed thousands with the Red Dust7) The Reverb effect for the visitors voice is gone entirely, that was an important part of the original series, it set them apart from us, was it just too expensive?8) The ""regulars"" drop like flies. Elias, Robin, even Julie and Ham went on hiatus for many episodes. We get Lydia, and Kyle, and Nathan, and Elizabeth in their place and its just not the same. Ham isn't even in the final, which sucked. It seemed to me that they took these amazing characters and just discarded them like trash.9) Donovan has a kid, Shawn; he was an awesome character in the original series and in the final battle. He gets converted by Diana and suddenly is this arrogant little visitor lover who apparently we as an audience aren't supposed to care about. Donovan didn't, he didn't even attempt to rescue him after the initial episode with Shawn betraying him. Diana didn't use Shawn to her advantage either. Mike doesn't even ask Phillip to Get Shawn out of there! And in the End when they all go to the mother ship, Mike never even looks for his own son!! Maybe it was his tight jeans; they cut off all the circulation to his brain.10) Elizabeth was a great idea, poorly executed and misused. The Star Child, who had all these powers and was so important, becomes this Fairy pink sexpot in the end and we don't even get to see the freaking leader? Huge Letdown.Even with the countless mistakes, and there are a TON more, I still love this series. Why? Because it's V. Because it's comforting, and familiar and its part of my childhood (back then I didn't notice its faux pas) I heard they are making a new one, supposed to come out this year and Mike, Julie, and Diana's characters are signed on to come back so far. I hope so, it would be nice to get some closure.",5,"Horrible production, Still Love it.",1169424000,"01 22, 2007",2007,5183,"['Being', 'child', '80', ""n't"", 'mean', 'was', 'born', 'time', 'GREW',

822350,A185BW9AVN076E,B00023BKMC,"C. E. L. Clair ""bijou88""","[305, 314]","In 1985, I didn't have a VCR. I loved ""V"" in 1983 and enjoyed ""V The Final Battle"" in 1984. I was really happy to hear that the struggles of Mike Donovan and the rest of the resistance were coming back as a series. At the time I worked at a local grocery store and, as fate would have it, I was usually scheduled when V the series was on. As a result I only caught a few episodes here and there when I had a day off. It was not as good as the two mini series but I thought it was entertaining. After a mere 19 episodes the show was cancelled and V was gone forever.Since that time, I ran across friends who didn't like the series. Whenever I found articles about ""V"", the series follow up was always dismissed as crass exploitation of the franchise. Last week, WB released the series (possibly to test the wind for a new mini series) on DVD for the first time. Finally, after nearly two decades (can it be that long?) I have been able to finally discover what the series was all about. Here are my impressions:There will be many SPOILERS so please do not read further if you want to be surprised.1. This series isn't bad. It is not as good as the two mini-series but it is entertaing in its own right. I also think that this show was innovative in the field of TV Science Fiction. Prior to ""V"", Science Fiction was very episodic. Star Trek, Space: 1999, Logan's Run, Planet of the Apes, Buck Rogers and to a certain extent, Battlestar Galactica all told self contained stories. The plot was resolved by the end of the hour. ""V"" The series was different in this respect. It had story arcs and continuing plot threads. Every episode ended in a cliff-hanger and it left you wanting more. In this aspect, it has a modern flavor. Like Babylon 5, StarGate SG 1 and Season 3 Enterprise, it tells a big story over a run of several episodes.2. People could die on ""V"". For most TV shows, you know that the heroes will make it in the end. Not on ""V"". Over the 19 episodes, long-standing characters like Dr. Maxwell and Elias Taylor buy the farm surprisingly abruptly. This raised the stakes dramatically and kept the viewer involved in the narrative.3. The cast was great. Marc Singer was perfectly cast as heroic Mike Donovan. Micheal Ironside ruled as perfect tough guy Ham. Jane Badler was very memorable as Uber-B**ch, Diana. June Chadwick was suitably catty as Diana'a rival Lydia. Duncan Rehgar was fantastic as Charles, the leader's envoy. His fight with Donovan in ""The Hero"" is classic. He was a great villain and it is a great shock when he is killed after a mere 4 episodes.4. There is a sense that this is merely a peek at a global war with the Visitors. For the first 12 episodes or so, The Freedom Network newscaster, Howard K. Smith ( A real journalist by the way) reads the headlines on the state of the war. We learn that the Visitors are sweeping through Spain and so forth. This makes us understand that The resistance in LA is only one story in this global conflict. It really gives the story a certain gravitas.5. The stories are often action adventure tales that are on par with anything that was on the air in the mid 1980s. Unfortunately, the sociological aspects that made the first mini series so memorable are ignored completely. The show, evan though it is watered down, is entertaining in its own right.There are some things that are unfortunatle about this show:1. All the SFX are recycled from the two mini series. (I think one new shot was filmed for ""The Dreadknot."") Even entire sequences are lifted from the minis. Remember when Donovan is on horseback and is being chased by a skyfighter? Well, the entire sequesce appears again in ""The Champion."" After a while, it becomes really grating to see the same shots over and over. I know that SFX on TV was really expensive back then but WB should have spent some money on new shots.2. As the series goes on, it is clear that there was less and less money bugeted for each episode. The first episode, ""Liberation Day"" has an outdoor crowd scene with hundreds of extras. By the last episode, we only have the main characters walking around on the standing sets. By the end, the production valules of the show looked rather thread bare.3. The producers decided to exploit the alien lizards by showing them without their Human masks. This was a mistake. The people who created the lizard makeups were not as artful as John Chambers. As a result the lizard appliances were very stiff and immoble. By showing the Lizards in their natural state too often, it undermined their credibility as a frightening threat. The full face lizards were about as scary and convincing as a halloween slip on mask. It became a bit silly.4. I hate cliffhangers that are unresolved. I can't understand why they would create a cliffhanger for a show that was doing poorly in the ratings. It is really unfair to viewers who watched every episode.5. The Star Child. One of the big weaknesses of ""The Final Battle"" was the ending where Elizabeth gets all glowy like Decker in Star Trek the Motion Picture. Elizabeth uses some kind of super powers that come out of nowhere and saves the day. In the series, the Star Child goes through some type of metamorphosis and comes out of a cacoon as a 17 year old love interest. Elizabeth's powers become a crutch that the writers could use to solve any problems that face the main characters. This undermines the drama of the series and cheapens the series. The powers were kind of kooky. The Star Child could levitate objects and people, mimic voices, had a photographic memory, raise the dead etc. She could do whatever the plot required. It was strange that they spent so much time on her character. I guess, as a writer with a deadline, she was really handy to have around.Well, thats my take on the series. I reccomend that if you like V, chances are you will like the series. It is a more cartoony version of Kenneth Johnson's creation but is worthy as entertainment and a nostalgic trip back to the 80s.",5,Great 80s Sci Fi Action!,1092873600,"08 19,

George,"[5, 6]","Like ""Star Trek"", ""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"" before it, ""V"" is yet another example of why science fiction is better suited as a mini-series or feature film than as a weekly program. Coming off the success of the six hour ""V:The Final Battle"" miniseries in the spring of 1984, NBC opted to develop a weekly series, with most of the cast returning to reprise their roles. It was expected to THE big hit on Friday nights, with a cushy 8PM time slot. Instead, the big hit on Friday nights was another new NBC program called ""Miami Vice"", while the ""V"" television series never matched the success it had achieved as a miniseries, lasting only five months before being cancelled.Yet ""V"" retains a cult following twenty years later, with rumors of a resurrection in 2005. I always enjoyed the show more than ""Galactica"" or ""Buck Rogers"", because I felt the characters, even the lizards, were more interesting than the other sci-fi shows. It also probably makes a difference that I was 14 and didn't mind watching Diana(played by the lovely Jane Badler) strut around with her big 80's hair and spandex uniform every week. Faye Grant(as resistance hero Julie)wasn't hard to look at, either. I wonder what happened to them when the series ended its' run.Surprisingly, the actor who found the most success post ""V"" was....Robert Englund! He, of course, became Freddy Krueger in the enormously successful ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" film series. In the ""V"" movies and series, he played Willie, the sympathetic lizard who aides the resistance in their fight against Diana's forces. Naturally, you can't speak of ""V"" without mentioning Marc Singer, whose Mike Donovan character is clearly molded after Harrison Ford's Han Solo, with the exception that Solo was a supporting character, while Donovan is the centerpiece in the ""V"" storyline.The problem with the ""V"" series was in it's regurgitation of space and air battle scenes. Obviously, the budget was lower than that of the miniseries, and it showed. The actors could be believable in their roles, but when you take out almost all the sci-fi in what's supposed to be a sci-fi show, the show is destined for failure. Still, it was good enough for me to warrant buying the DVD package(and now I can get my Diana fix anytime).",4,Another sci-fi program that didn't last,1091923200,"08 8, 2004",2004,2295,"['Star', 'Trek', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Buck', 'Rogers', '25th', 'Century', 'V', 'yet', 'example', 'why', 'science', 'fiction', 'better', 'suited', 'mini-series', 'feature', 'film', 'weekly', 'program', 'Coming', 'off', 'success', 'six', 'hour', 'V', 'Final', 'Battle', 'miniseries', 'spring', '1984', 'NBC', 'opted', 'develop', 'weekly', 'series', 'most', 'cast', 'returning', 'reprise', 'roles', 'was', 'expected', 'THE', 'big', 'hit', 'Friday', 'nights', 'cushy', '8PM', 'time', 'slot', 'Instead', 'big', 'hit', 'Friday', 'nights', 'was', 'new', 'NBC', 'program', 'called', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'V', 'television', 'series', 'never', 'matched', 'success', 'had', 'achieved', 'miniseries', 'lasting', 'only', 'five', 'months', 'being', 'cancelled.Yet', 'V', 'cult', 'following', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'rumors', 'resurrection', '2005', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'more', 'Galactica', 'Buck', 'Rogers', 'felt', 'characters', 'even', 'lizards', 'were', 'more', 'interesting', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'shows', 'also', 'probably', 'difference', 'was', '14', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'Diana', 'played', 'lovely', 'Jane', 'Badler', 'strut', 'big', '80', 'hair', 'spandex', 'uniform', 'week', 'Faye', 'Grant', 'resistance', 'hero', 'Julie', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'look', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'series', 'ended', 'run.Surprisingly', 'actor', 'who', 'found', 'most', 'success', 'post', 'V', 'was', '.Robert', 'Englund', 'course', 'became', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'enormously', 'successful', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'film', 'series', 'V', 'movies', 'series', 'played', 'Willie', 'sympathetic', 'lizard', 'who', 'resistance', 'fight', 'Diana', 'forces', 'Naturally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'V', 'mentioning', 'Marc', 'Singer', 'Mike', 'Donovan', 'character', 'clearly', 'molded', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Han', 'Solo', 'exception', 'Solo', 'was', 'supporting', 'character', 'Donovan', 'centerpiece', 'V', 'storyline.The', 'problem', 'V', 'series', 'was', 'regurgitation', 'space', 'air', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Obviously', 'budget', 'was', 'lower', 'miniseries', 'showed', 'actors', 'could', 'be', 'believable', 'roles', 'when', 'take', 'out', 'almost', 'sci-fi', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'show', 'destined', 'failure', 'Still', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'warrant', 'buying', 'DVD', 'package', 'now', 'can', 'get', 'Diana', 'fix', 'anytime']",N/A

The 1951 seminal sci fi classic ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", and the classic episode ""To serve Man"" from Twilight Zone show that battling bad guy aliens have been around for years.Things are not what they seem at all when the ""Visitors"" come to call on planet earth. The visitors, appearing as attractive humans, are actually reptiles underneath, literally, a veneer of humanity. They desire our earth and our people, and disguise their true purpose by appearing willing to share technical and medical breakthroughs. Soon however, the truth is revealed to a small band of resistance fighters who learn the true agenda. Aliens try to attack the resistance and the resistance battles as best they can, while keeping their true identities secret. To put a face to the menace the ""Visitors"" say that scientists are the ones causing problems and they begin to round up scientists with the help of a willing populace lulled by the ""Gifts"" they have been given. There is a wonderful scene in which Michael Cimino, playing an old survivor of a concentration camp, tells his son why they must hide the scientist and his family, and relates it to the horror he went through. One episode ends when kids take to spray painting over visitor posters as the visitors have been ""outed"" to quite a few people at that point. The old character scolds them, not for defacing the poster but for not sending a counter message. He shows them how to paint V, for victory, giving their actions a message and them a goal. Well done!True, some of the visuals are NOT up to todays CGI, but the message is strong in this one.

It's funny even when it's not supposed to be. It's as fun as your favorite kid show or old comic book. The characters are soo likable and that includes those who want to eat humans for lunch!

I could only vaguely remember the tv series since it has been 20 years since I'd seen the episodes. On the plus side, I have enjoyed looking back at these shows and finally watching many that I had never had the chance to view before. Unfortunately, the words of one reviewer managed to ring true in reference to re-used footage from the movies and some of the hokey scenes in the series. You can thank NBC for their unwillingness to provide a real budget and the absence of Kenneth Johnson's creative mind for these things. This series could have lasted at least 3 to 5 seasons if things were in place. The cast however really did their best to make the best of the plots they had to deal with. Jane Badler, Marc Singer, Faye Grant and a number of others made the series worth watching and worth buying today. The price is pretty reasonable for 19 episodes. Other sets with a comparable number of episodes go for about $40 to $50.A couple of other things were lacking. There are no interviews or background info on the shows and the sound has not been upgraded (it's still mono). I also found the quality of the discs themselves to be somewhat poor. I had to return one copy because disc 2 had laser rot and skipped badly. The next copy I bought again had a defect on the same disc, same episode but has a minor skip in one scene this time (keep in mind this was another store altogether).

Remember the Atari? The Nintendo ORIGINAL console? It was nostalgic to say the least.The reason I said that the series was just `OK' was because it started off with a pasty, unrealistic special effects fight between Diana and Mike - the leader of the V and the leader of the Resistance. I had not seen the first and second miniseries in over 20 years and so I was thrown off by the shoddy special effects that were unprecedented during the time they aired. I was only thrown off because I had not seen what led up to the beginning of the series. I have watched the original series on the SciFi channel since and have become more excited about finishing the TV series once I have completed the miniseries. In short, I have not yet seen the entire TV series - I stopped the DVD after about 2 minutes of watching it. Once I have, I'll re-write this review.For now, I'll just tell you don't buy this set unless you have watched both V - The Original TV Miniseries, and V - The Final Battle.

822384,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,B00023BKMC,Kevin R. Austra,"[0, 0]","V: THE COMPLETE SERIES is a welcome addition to a collection including the first two television mini series.  Considering that the second mini series left numerous unresolved issues it was more than appropriate to launch a weekly television series.  More importantly it was great to see the resistance heroes and alien villains again.  When this series first aired I religiously watched every one, as well as recorded them on VHS.  Alas the series was canceled and went into repeats and then quickly disappeared.This series' most powerful episodes were the season opener, second episode and the ending cliffhanger.  The episodes in between were good, but sometimes seemed rushed in order to conclude them in 48 minutes.  As the aliens, primarily Diana, were defeated in almost every episode it is a wonder that Diana was not relieved of command and sent packing.  In many ways Diana was akin to the character of German Captain Dietrich in the 1960's television series THE RAT PATROL where he found himself weekly bested by the Allied jeep raiders.Unfortunately V: The Television Series was unfairly compared to its television movie predecessors.  It suffered the same malady as movie-to-series shows such as KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER.  If you recall THE NIGHT STALKER and THE NIGHT STRANGLER television movies scored high ratings and left the viewing audience in anticipation of the next installment.  The next installment however ended up as a weekly television series with only a handful of episodes with stories worthy of the original movies.  KOLCHAK was canceled after 20 episodes.  V similarly pursued this familiar pattern.With V: THE SERIES it was great to see the heroes and villains again.  Marc Singer, Faye Grant, Jane Badler, Michael Ironside, Robert Englund and others reprised their roles from the original mini series.  In the television series the resistance was quickly put to the test against a renewed alien offensive.  Many of the episodes began with a news summary of the global battle with the visitors before focusing back on Los Angeles.  In many ways the V television series became a weekly version of RED DAWN with the resistance, much like RED DAWN's Wolverines, constantly harassing the Visitors.  An additional element was added in the character of multi-millionaire industrialist Nathan Bates (the late Lane Smith, who also co-starred in RED DAWN as a collaborationist mayor whose son served with the guerillas) who forced Diana into making him the governor of the open city of Los Angeles.  For the most part Bates appears to be an opportunist profiteer who derives his power from keeping a balance between the resistance and the aliens.  At other times he alludes to simply buying time to figure a way to defeat the Visitors.Unfortunately the television series was cut short of its prime.  Success relied on its ability to break free of the large shadow cast by the two successful mini series in as few episodes as possible.  It was unable to accomplish this.The first hurdle was that the per episode budget was a fraction of that of the mini series.  Although each episode boasted a one million dollar production price tag (a considerable sum in the mid 1980's), the show relied heavily on recycled special effects and film clips from the prior mini series.  The most blatant of these was a horse chase scene involving The Visitors pursuing Donovan.  The aliens in the television series also resort to driving around in various automobiles and riding motorcycles instead of piloting Visitor spacecraft.  The television series also never attempted to invent a plausible reason why the Visitors continued to masquerade as humans (other than the obvious production expense).  Quinn Martin was able to contrive a simple scenario for the aliens in the 1960's series THE INVADERS and the writers of V should have been able to do likewise.The second challenge was that the action had to be scaled down to fit into a single episode.  The stories were centered on Los Angeles.  Though there was a continuing thread involving the Star Child, the weekly plots followed a formula of the Visitors planning something mischievous and the resistance upsetting the Visitors' plans.  Some reviewers have aptly described V episodes as ""The Battle of the Week.""  One of the biggest blunders was the death of the character Martin in the first episode.  It was a senseless death that only resulted in the character returning later, albeit as a different alien.The final handicap of the television episodes can be attributed to the rushed conclusion of the second mini series.  Indeed the original writer of the first television movie (and co-writer of the second until he walked away from the project) Kenneth Johnson planned a more significant ending to the second film.  Alas, the network demanded a budget grounded in frugality and the grand finale was much less spectacular than originally intended.  As you recall in V: THE FINAL BATTLE the world was on the verge of alien domination when the miraculous release of red dust chased the aliens away.  The show finale left many loose threads that were never answered in the television series such as the question as to what ever happened to the thousands of humans, including heads of state, held in suspended animation within the numerous mother ships.  Diana also escaped from the mother ship and, as confirmed by the opening episode of the television series, headed back to Earth.  It would have been more logical for her to turn-and-burn in search of one of the other fleeing mother ships rather than flee to the red dust poisoned Earth.The subsequent weekly television series was thus saddled with coming up with a believable story as to how the Visitors were able to return.  In this they were successful with Diana's chance discovery that the air had become safely breathable because of the bacteria's inability to survive in environments that are warm year round.  With southern California essentially red dust free the Visitors returned.  The world is thus divided between the year round warm climates environs, dominated by the Visitors, and the more temperate zones controlled by the free world.  Unfortunately this did not explain why the aliens chose not to enter the contaminated areas in their spacecraft, in spacesuits, or just destroy the free zones using their advanced weapons.  Likewise the Visitors allowed life to pretty much carry on in their zones of occupation.  Public utilities functioned; people had access to fuel and groceries, and were generally left alone as long as they made no attempt to escape the heel of the conqueror.  Considering that the aliens desperately needed the Earth to replace their own dying world it is a wonder they did not set about cleansing the occupied zones of their human inhabitants.  These are issues that might have been addressed in future episodes.Continuity of the series was not helped when NBC refused to air episode three, ""Breakout"" reportedly over the issue of violence.  As such episode does not logically flow into episode four.  Both episodes boast stories where Kyle is introduced to the resistance for the first time and Robin likewise reunited twice with her friends.  Episode three is thankfully included in the DVD set.By mid season V foundered in the ratings.  Kenneth Johnson reportedly declined an offer to return and produce the television series.  The show took a new direction beginning with more ominous music during the opening credits.  The credits were accompanied by narration that ignored the already established storyline that the Visitors had been chased away by the red dust.  The opening credits had to change because the cast dramatically changed.  Characters from the original miniseries, including mercenaries Ham Tyler (Michael Ironside) and Chris Farber (Mickey Jones), resistance fighter Robin Maxwell (Blair Tefkin), and night club owner Elias Taylor (Michael Wright) abruptly exited the series.  Other characters unique to the television series, including V Commander Charles (Duncan Regehr), industrialist Nathan Bates (Lane Smith), as well as Bates' assistant Mr. Chiang (Aki Aleong) were also written out of the show.  Even Howard K. Smith's opening news broadcast segments disappeared.Modest additions to the cast were Judson Scott as V Lieutenant James.  Recall that Scott was featured in STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN as Khan's first officer.  Frank Ashmore also returned as V Inspector General Philip.  Ashmore basically reprised his role as Donovan's Visitor friend Martin, though this time around as Martin's twin brother Philip.The final episode was an unresolved cliffhanger worthy of the original mini series.  Despite more than two decades of discussion about a possible concluding third mini series, the project was eventually dropped in favor of 2009's remake of a new series.I am a fan of the original two television movies and adding this television series was only natural.  If the series had been granted an additional season it very well could have evolved out of the shadow of its predecessors.  Relatively economic CGI special effects were still some years in coming.  Additionally at the time V: THE SERIES was launched it was limited to the major television networks.  Years later it would have had its pick of cable and satellite channels. Indeed two years later STAR TREK THE NEXT GENERATION was able to parlay a successful science fiction franchise and sustain weekly stories for seven years despite the powerful following of the original series and its full length motion pictures.V: THE COMPLETE SERIES is very affordable.  Even though the new (2009) V is also a very good series, my allegiance belongs to the original 1983 - 1985 franchise.",3,Too Much of a Good Thing,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,9738,"['V', 'COMPLETE',

A kind of ""female Hitler up-and-coming"".I remember when it was found out about us being the FOOD!

If you look for one of the first shots of the spacecraft appearing over the cities, you can see Dominique in that wide shot when the neighborhood folk come out and looks up.I'm sorry..but for the series acting, writing, concept and ideology of fighting against oppression..this series IS the bomb!!!!The commentary by the first director is also fantastic. He talks about how the fighting against oppression in South Africa, at the time, sparked a wave of RED ""V""s to be painted as a symbol against that oppression...and that was halfway around the world and to the south. Most people did not understand the global impact of it's deep rooted human meaning and power.

The series is not as good as the movies; because of the changes in the aliens voices and alot of the cast that was in the movies were not in the series. I thought the first 12 episodes were good, because Lane Smith's character, Nathan Bates, the mole who plays both side. The problem with this series is they killed off Nathan Bate's in episode 13; and the series just didn't make sense after that. I believe that's why it only lasted 1 season, eventhough Donovan, Diana, Willie, and Julie were there throughout it still couldn't save it from the chopping block. They did try to help it some by brining Frank Ashmore back as Martin's twin Brother; but it just wasn't enough.

Personally I find the series far easier to watch and a lot of my V memories come from this show. Pretty much all the characters are back from V & V: The Final Battle and nobody was recast from what I recall which is always a plus. We get much more Diana and her scenes with Lydia are so hilariously bitchy you think you're watching Dynasty or Dallas, complete with big hair, glittery outfits and far too much blusher. Robert Englund as Willy is an absolute joy to watch and it's a shame he got typcast so quickly after the Elm street success as this show proves his diversity as an actor. Elizabeth of course goes from eight years old to eighteen but this is actually a good idea as it opens up the possibilities for better storylines although by writing out her mother Robin three quarters of the way through they missed on the chance to devlope that relationship of mother and daughter being practically the same age. The addition of Kyle I was never too happy with as he just seemed to be the pretty boy replacement for the Ham Tyler character. Why Ham was written out I will never know, he worked wonderfully well as the opposite of Marc Singer's Donovan and was far more interesting.By the end of these 19 episodes you do wonder why it was never picked up for a second season. But I believe when it aired it was up against Benson/Webster and Dukes of Hazzard so it really didn't have much hope did it? A real shame.

And this was acceptable effects wise to audiences of the day. So IGNORE any review that goes on about effects.this show was a good show but did have budget problems that made it more inconsistant perhaps than the classic two miniseries. However for audiences in 1984 -85 having decent sci fi on your tele was a good thing so it was good to get some at least decent sci fi to watch.  OF course compared to the first two miniseries which were watched by one in three people: it's not quite as good perhaps,  and I remember seeing a whole army unit sitting in front of a tv spellbound viewing those! Something like that won't happen again probably. Anyways due to budget constraints this show just did the best it could , I don't mind the plots at all like some people did , in fact they aren't that bad at all and are very good in the start of this show. Still the effects are fine for their day but little things like dropping the synth voices and such don't help here. I love the original two series so this one had to be had by me. The dvd needs to be cleaned up though, I hope in the future studios will run all their properties through digital cleaning to get rid of the specks of dirt and lines. I would say that this is really a 3 and a half effort because it continues on the story.

822395,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B00023BKMC,Monty Moonlight,"[2, 2]","Following the two original ""V"" miniseries (""V"" and ""V: The Final Battle""), ""V: The Series"" shows us what happened after the final battle and then moves forward a year later, when the success of the resistance and the return to normal life is interrupted by the return of the Visitors, led by the infamous and ruthless Diana, in another attempt to dominate and devour mankind and Earth's precious natural resources. Of course, the old team gets back together to fight the good fight, led once again by Mike Donovan and the gorgeous Julie Parrish, not to mention brash but resourceful Ham Tyler. Alien turncoat Willie is back too, of course, closely attached to the now restaurant owning Elias Taylor, whose business serves at times to offer up shades of ""Casablanca"". Other familiar faces on the good guy side are Ham's old buddy Chris and the Maxwells, whiney Robin (granted, she went through a lot), her father Robert, and her half lizard daughter, Elizabeth, who goes into a metamorphosis state early in the show and emerges as a young adult. Some new bad guys are in town too, most notably Nathan Bates, a greedy businessman who has taken control of Los Angeles and is constantly trying to work both sides of the resurging war. But also important is Diana's new rival, Lydia, with whom she enjoys a catty competition throughout the series in classic '80's nighttime soap style.""V: The Series"" is, quite simply, a guilty pleasure for those who love it, like myself. It doesn't have the inspiration or budget of the original miniseries duo, and yet it has so much to be praised for too. Sure, the whole series is contrived as a way to just make more of something that was justifiably popular, and it has a lot of illogicalities. Still, it runs a continuous story that stays interesting throughout, only feeling episodic towards the end, but still coming around to an actual ending... sort of. But, I'll get to that in a minute. What really made this show great, in my opinion, besides the beautiful Faye Grant as Julie Parrish (admittedly, small blondes seem to be my thing), was that this show captured the feeling/spirit of the Star Wars saga. I mean, you may not think it to look at it, you may be more reminded at times of ""Planet of the Apes: The Series"", but the general feel of the show, the stories, the characters,... aside from the budget and Earth setting, this is what a Star Wars TV series should really be like! The rebellion and the heroes are very Star Wars-esque, there's no doubt there was some inspiration taken from the saga here. These are adventure stories about a little rebellion fighting a big empire in ships and on the ground. The episodes are fun, exciting, and interesting, and the drama, hammy as it is, keeps you glued to the set. The regular cast is just so good, each in their own way; just perfect for the show as it was. It had its silly cliches, but it was just so much fun, and it still is when you watch it today. You really never knew exactly what was going to happen next or who might get killed off, but you knew that whenever the Visitors were shown, they would probably eat something gross. Stock footage is used a lot, the alien babies look silly, and budget constraints even affected continuity (like dropping the alien voice issue altogether), but it is just a wonderful sci-fi fantasy show. Granted, the quality drops off somewhat towards the end. SPOILER ALERT: The romantic relationships we come to believe in do not payoff for the viewers in the end, and the final episode kind of ends things up, but also with a cliff hanger (as if there was just one more episode intended). SPOILER END. But faults aside, it is a fantastic ride! And one episode even has a life-long crush of mine, Sherri Stoner (live-action model for Disney's Little Mermaid), even though she plays an annoying (but beautiful) tomboy, ha. Nice to finally have some footage of her. I need to get some of her other 80's acting performances in the future.Starring Marc Singer, Faye Grant, Jane Badler, Robert Englund, Michael Ironside, Lane Smith, and a host of others, ""V: The Series"" is a true piece of television history. This DVD set collects all 19 episodes of the series (sadly, with zero bonus features), and I highly recommend it, but be sure to get and view the two miniseries first. While the budget drops for the show, resulting in a few changes (like the aforementioned and unexplained loss of the aliens' distinctive voices), the story flows seamlessly. And, honestly, while I really like the new version of ""V"" that currently airs on ABC, the original simply cannot be touched, and George Lucas should really look to this entire saga to find the spirit that has been missing from his more recent Star Wars productions, especially if that live-action series is still on the slate.",5,The Spirit All New Star Wars is Lacking,1275523200,"06 3,

The original movie is good enough but as a series this show just borders on awful. The acting is pretty bad and the plots are pretty weak. The Evil Lizard leaders talk as if they are rich ego maniacs. The resistance seems to hide in plain sight. When there is a shoot out the Lizard ray guns just go zip, zip, zip, hitting objects but not even leaving a mark. And both the evil lizards and the resistance folks are dressed in tight sexy clothes. The blonde guy is forever showing off his bulge. The lizard women, Diana and the other gal give us many nice shots of their asses. I watch this show but my mind wanders because the plots are always so lame and melodramatic. I think this could have been a great series but the writing is simply too bad. And the show looks like it was shot on a Hollywood back lot and certainly in California. The setting looks too much like too many television shows that I have already seen. So the show must have been shot in Hollywood, CA, or wherever they shoot most of the really low budget tv shows, that soon find themselves getting cancelled.

There are some noteworthy elements:  this series had an operatic story arc, something totally unused by any television show at the time, that would anticipate the mythology arc of X-Files and the season-long arcs that were so common to Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Also, though often hammy and overacted, the villains Diana and Lydia were quite fun to watch as they sparred and plotted against each other while the resistance would routinely make fools of them on the surface below.

Oh it's great for MST3K-ing, but don't expect quality. Expecting quality from this television show version of what was once great is like expecting great musicianship on a Britney Spears album: anything's possible, but I'm not holding my breath.How many ways did they destroy V with this series, oh can they even be enumerated . . .1. Wretched dialogue - like when the Beastmaster goes &quot;That's showmanship, I'm a newsman&quot; so far past the hilt he made William Shatner look subtle. Or Diana's speech to her crew in the second episode &quot;today we conquer a world&quot; - sheesh.2. Overhaul attempt number 1 - They tried for the first several episodes to make it a commentary on corporate America, with an evil corporate tycoon causing the visitors to return.3. Introducing Paul Stanley of Kiss - Ok, not really, but they did redub Elizabeth the &quot;Star Child,&quot; and give her ridiculous powers that somehow deux ex machina their way out of having to resolve half their conflicts.4. Faye Grant sings. Ok, while the was one of the hottest stars on TV in the 80s, things went WAY too far when some idiot thought having her sing on the Christmas episode was a good idea.5. Overhaul attempt number 2 - V meets The A Team. Ok, halfway through the season, half the actors had quit because the show sucked so much, so the second half of the show features the 4 or 5 remaining &quot;good guys&quot; riding around California in a van, helping people fight the visitors everywhere they go with &quot;reset button ending&quot; adventure of the week type episodes.6. Back from the dead - Martin returns from the dead, sort of, as a twin brother who wants to kill Donovan, then joins him, then essentially becomes what his brother had been and . . oh you get the point.7. Even WORSE dialogue - when the best line out of the whole last 7 or so episodes is Diana asking her lover &quot;would you like for me to peel you another goldfish&quot; then the show has truly lost it.8. The &quot;Julie's long lost lover&quot; episode, complete with slow-motion picture-on-picture memory lane montages. Need I say more?9. The de facto finale. Is it just me, or did the last 10 minutes of the finale have everyone feeling a bit of deja vu?10. The unfilmed. Just let me go on record as saying to those of you who hoped for the legendary final unfilmed episode: the script (which I've read) sucked beyond anything they'd ever done before.

822407,A3GB36CE9BCQHT,B00023BKMC,"Rob Tudor and Bobb Robinson ""robnbobb""","[12, 14]","For the uninitiated, ""V"" followed on the heels of ""V: The Mini-Series"" and ""V: The Final Battle"", two NBC movies-of-the-week that dramatized a pre-""Independence Day"" battle between humans and aliens for ownership of the Earth.  The aliens, initially presenting themselves as friends, soon revealed that they were lizard people wearing human masks, and that they were fond of eating things like mice, hamsters, and.... well, people.The rag-tag band of human freedom fighters eventually banish the ""Visitors"" through the deployment of ""Red Dust"", a bacterial agent that makes the aliens die horrible deaths but luckily not the humans.""V"" the tv show begins a year after the ""red dust"" business, when the humans discover that not only have the aliens been biding their time, hanging our behind the moon, but also that the red dust is ineffective in any locale that doesn't have regular freezes.  Like Brazil, Florida and Southern California.  Los Angeles is somehow set up as an ""open city"" where the humans and aliens can peacefully co-exist, while the aliens presumably go about their business of eating everyone else on the planet.The special effects, which were state-of-the-art in the movies, have devolved to television standards.  Which means they rely on lots of car chases, motorcycle chases, horse chases and anything else they can do to avoid having to use footage of space-ships, which they only have two shots of which they use over and over.  Once in a while they'll show an alien eating a mouse, which involves having the alien pick up a mouse, walk toward the camera so his hands can't be seen, whereupon the live mouse is replaced with white chocolate or marzipan or something that the actor can pop into their mouth.The show stars Faye Grant as Dr. Julie McCoy.  Her name's not really  ""McCoy"", but I can't remember what it really is so I said ""McCoy"".  She's secretly working on creating new red dust with Nathan Bates, CEO of Science Frontiers, who is buddying up with Diana, the leader of the aliens.  In real life, Grant is married to the dreamy Stephen Collins.  She would have been better off staying home to tend to her husband, rather than be involved in this mess.Jane Badler as Diana, and June Chadwick as Lydia, do their best impressions of Alexis and Krystal Carrington, only with more hair and not as much talent. (And saying someone has less talent than Linda Evans is REALLY saying something.) Why Diana doesn't kill and eat Lydia I'll never understand, since Lydia is apparently an underling and is always catty and quarrelsome.A pre-""Beastmaster"" Marc Singer is Mike Donavan, who proudly announces in the first episode that he's a ""newsman"".  His face always looks like he's suffering extreme lower back pain, and if you've seen a recent picture of him you'll know that all that grimacing didn't do his face any favors.  Sometimes Donavan is looking for his teenage son who's been brainwashed by the aliens, but the mention of the son dries up after a while, much like older brother Chuck on ""Happy Days"".Michael Ironside is Ham Tyler, some sort of professional freedom fighter.  Let me repeat that his name is Ham.  For some reason he calls Donavan ""Gooder""...I'm really not sure why, but I imagine it must have gone something like this:Ham: ""I'm good.""Donavan: ""Yeah, well  I'm gooder.""Ham:  ""Hmm, I think I'll call you Gooder.""In fact, I'm really not sure of ANY of Ham's thoughts or motivations, because he mumbles all of his dialogue so low in his voice that I have to turn up the volume whenever he appears just to be sure he's speaking.  Apparently, he and Gooder are involved in some sort of competition to see who can wear the tightest jeans.  Gooder's are tighter, but Ham has more to show for his efforts (if you don't know what I'm talking about, you're not gay or female), which may be why he was scuttled off the show mid-way through the season.Jennifer Cooke is Elizabeth the ""Star Child"", the product of a human-alien tryst.  In the first episode she was the little girl from ""Poltergeist"", then she went into a cocoon that was protected by rattlesnakes, then she emerged as a lovely young woman with a closet full of Laura Ashley.  And she can move things with her mind.  And play piano.  And Diana's always looking for her.  And she likes to flirt with Kyle, the ""rebellious but loveable"" male ing&eacute;nue whose only other purpose in the show is to wear tight jeans, take his shirt off and ride motorcycles.  Oh, and flirt with Robin, who is ELIZABETH'S MOTHER.A pre-""Freddy Krueger"" Robert Englund is Willie, and alien who's decided to help the humans out not by providing detailed intelligence, but by TENDING BAR.  His most endearing quality is that he mixes up English words, for example, he may say ""Glad to feet you"", when he means ""Glad to meet you"".  Isn't that cute?  Except that he does it, like, every third  word, even though EVERY OTHER ALIEN ON THE PLANET CAN SPEAK PERFECT ENGLISH.In a word, this series is so deliciously bad that EVERYONE MUST OWN IT.",5,Will

I watched the miniseries first, the final battle, and now the complete series. And it did seem to lose its momentum. First of all, the Complete Series looks pretty bad compared to the Miniseries & The Final Battle DVDs. The prints look like 2nd or 3rd Gen. copies. They look really dark and have the occasional grain and stains on the corners of the pictures. This is more visible in the intro of the show. The writing also suffers quite a bit in the Complete Series. The acting also suffers from the poor writing. Poor Faye Grant (Dr. Jule Parrish) looks lost in most scenes and Jane Badler (Diana) became a parody of her character. And lets not get started on the Michael Jackson ""Thriller"" rip-off jacket that the ""Visitors"" wear. But the story is still as great as the miniseries. It's about survival and that never gets lost in the show. I would suggest to anyone who's a younger fan of Science-Fiction who's never seen this show to pick up the Miniseries, and work your way up to the Complete Series.

The two mini-series are sold separately. My mind boggles at how many people can't comprehend this.Anyway...I remember how excited I was as a kid, waiting for this show to premiere. The first episode, picking up the story where The Final Battle left off, was tremendous. Very well mounted and a great beginning. Everything seemed pretty logical and not all that dumbed down. The music by Dennis McCarthy is still some of my favorite sci-fi scoring.Sadly, the series began to deteriorate pretty much from that point on. The second episode introduced the ""car chase"" to the V universe and from then on, that was the action setpiece of choice. That, running gun battles and fistfights. Suddenly, the physically strong Visitors all had glass jaws. One jab to the face (with the patented LOUD punch sound effect) was enough to drop a Visitor. However, the first 2/3 of the series were good fun and sort of in the vein of the second mini-series. Then the edict came down that they had to drop cast members to save money (as if they were spending any to begin with). I the space of two weeks, they lost four regulars and to semi-regular characters. All of a sudden, it seemed like the Resistance was made up of five people (sort of like Earth Final Conflict had two measly resistors in the final season).But, the actors and music retained high quality. At the very least, the fights were well done. But they happened so often, by the time we got to the final episode, even the characters knew fisticuffs were inevitable. When Donovan, Kyle and Phillip reach the control room in the mother ship in the finale, Phillip says they can't shoot or they'll hit the controls.Kyle: ""So what do we do?""Donovan: ""There's only one thing TO do.""Kyle: ""You mean...a fist fight?""Okay, Kyle doesn't say that, but it felt like he should have. The finale was a cut above the previous few episodes, but it was still extremely sad, especially when you think about how far the show had fallen since the original mini-series. Nothing made sense anymore. And yeah, they had that cliffhanger ending, but you know the only thing that truly made it a cliffhanger was the fact that Diana (somehow, while under arrest and unseen by anyone) planted a bomb in the Leader's shuttle. If they simply omitted her line about it, and left it with Kyle joining Elizabeth by stowing away (apparently using the same invisibility method Diana had), it would have been an okay ending.Every episode is here and complete except for the pre-credits previews/recaps which were replaced by the WB logo. There is no remastering and the prints are well below standard. However, at least the didn't ""widescreen"" it like they did the two miniseries (with the BS story about them being filmed in 16:9). Double sided DVDs, ugh and not a single bonus feature. But since (as of August 2009) the set is only $15, you're not getting ripped off.I still love this show, since I like my TV to be fun. That's exactly what it is, grand fun for undemanding tastes. Hopefully, with the remake coming, WB will restore the prints to pristine condition on Blu-Ray, fix the aspect ratio of the two mini-series and spring for some bonus features.

822412,A3FDO58UAHVQD1,B00023BKMC,Servo,"[3, 3]","Created by Kenneth Johnson (CBS'sThe Incredible Hulk) ""V: The Series"" was the resulting spinoff of the highly successful TV miniseriesVandV: The Final Battle. Personally, I thought (at the time) the franchise was tampering with success by advancing the story with a weekly TV series, given the possibility of decline in level of quality and the inevitable cost issues that came with producing a weekly sci-fi series. But then V was never really about the effects but more about the human struggle, the right to survive against a seemingly unstoppable foe - the mysterious Visitors. And the series, for the most part, continued the struggle fairly well.The series starts off strong by picking up exactly where V: The Final Battle left off with ""Liberation Day"" (where Visitors leader Diana escapes from capture and Starchild Elizabeth undergoes a transformation), then suffers slightly in tone after ""The Betrayal"" (where several strong characters exit the show) and sadly ends on a solid yet lackluster note with ""The Return"". Regardless, V: The Series remains just as entertaining today as it did back in the '80s thanks mostly to the great cast, old and new. Props to Warner Home Video for restoring ""Breakout"" back to its intended 3rd episode position between ""Dreadnought"" and ""The Deception"". Originally, the episode was pulled because it was considered too violent for its predominantly younger audience.V - The Complete Series is a 3-disc (897 min.) set featuring all 19 episodes; Full Frame (1.33:1) video; 1.0 English mono audio; English, French, Spanish subtitles; Closed Captioning. The discs are housed in a digi-pak case similar to V: The Final Battle. The menus are static ""red dust"" screens (cool and inspired) featuring one cast member per screen and a list of options which include a ""play all"" feature. Aside from a few grainy matte/effects shots that pop up here and there, the picture and sound are fairly clean. Night-time scenes look especially good. Episodes include: Liberation Day (10/26/84), Dreadnought (11/2/84), Breakout (5/24/85), The Deception (11/9/84), The Sanction (11/16/84), Visitors' Choice (11/23/84), The Overlord (11/30/84), The Dissident (12/14/84), Reflections in Terror (12/21/84), The Conversion (1/4/85), The Hero (1/11/85), The Betrayal (1/18/85), The Rescue (2/2/85), The Champion ((2/8/85), The Wildcats (2/15/85), The Littlest Dragon (2/22/85), War of Illusions (3/8/85), Secret Underground (3/15/85), The Return (3/22/85).",5,V: The Series Complete And Uncut On DVD!,1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,2472,"['Created', 'Kenneth', 'Johnson', ""CBS'sThe"", 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'V', 'Series', 'was', 'resulting', 'spinoff', 'highly', 'successful', 'TV', 'miniseriesVandV', 'Final', 'Battle', 'Personally', 'thought', 'time', 'franchise', 'was', 'tampering', 'success', 'advancing', 'story', 'weekly', 'TV', 'series', 'given', 'possibility', 'decline', 'level', 'quality', 'inevitable', 'cost', 'issues', 'came', 'producing', 'weekly', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'then', 'V', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'effects', 'more', 'human', 'struggle', 'right', 'survive', 'seemingly', 'unstoppable', 'foe', 'mysterious', 'Visitors', 'series', 'most', 'part', 'continued', 'struggle', 'fairly', 'well.The', 'series', 'strong', 'picking', 'up', 'exactly', 'where', 'V', 'Final', 'Battle', 'left', 'off', 'Liberation', 'Day', 'where', 'Visitors', 'leader', 'Diana', 'capture', 'Starchild', 'Elizabeth', 'transformation', 'then', 'slightly', 'tone', 'Betrayal', 'where', 'several', 'strong', 'characters', 'exit', 'show', 'sadly', 'solid', 'yet', 'lackluster', 'note', 'Return', 'Regardless', 'V', 'Series', 'just', 'entertaining', 'today', 'did', 'back', ""'80s"", 'thanks', 'mostly', 'great', 'cast', 'old', 'new', 'Props', 'Warner', 'Home', 'Video', 'restoring', 'Breakout', 'back', 'intended', '3rd', 'episode', 'position', 'Dreadnought', 'Deception', 'Originally', 'episode', 'was', 'pulled', 'was', 'considered', 'too', 'violent', 'predominantly', 'younger', 'audience.V', 'Complete', 'Series', '3-disc', '897', 'min', 'set', 'featuring', '19', 'episodes', 'Full', 'Frame', '1.33:1', 'video', '1.0', 'English', 'mono', 'audio', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'discs', 'are', 'housed', 'digi-pak', 'case', 'similar', 'V', 'Final', 'Battle', 'menus', 'are', 'static', 'red', 'dust', 'screens', 'cool', 'inspired', 'featuring', 'one', 'cast', 'member', 'screen', 'list', 'options', 'include', 'play', 'feature', 'Aside', 'few', 'grainy', 'matte/effects', 'shots', 'pop', 'up', 'here', 'there', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'fairly', 'clean', 'Night-time', 'scenes', 'look', 'especially', 'good', 'Episodes', 'include', 'Liberation', 'Day', '10/26/84', 'Dreadnought', '11/2/84', 'Breakout', '5/24/85', 'Deception', '11/9/84', 'Sanction', '11/16/84', 'Visitors', 'Choice', '11/23/84', 'Overlord', '11/30/84', 'Dissident', '12/14/84', 'Reflections', 'Terror', '12/21/84', 'Conversion', '1/4/85', 'Hero', '1/11/85', 'Betrayal', '1/18/85', 'Rescue', '2/2/85', 'Champion', '2/8/85', 'Wildcats', '2/15/85', 'Littlest', 'Dragon', '2/22/85', 'War', 'Illusions', '3/8/85', 'Secret', 'Underground', '3/15/85', 'Return', '3/22/85']",N/A

Before DVD's, they had released only the Mini-series and the Final Battle on tape which cost almost $100 at the time. So when I first saw it finally available on DVD, I immediately bought them. Some people seem to be confused with what the Complete Series is. It's the weekly tv show that aired after the Mini-Series and Final Battle. Some people may not like the old tv show but it was the same people/same actors involved so I enjoyed it.The package is very nice compared to nowadays. Pictures of the show and each episode are described as the cover folds out. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because of the episodes being on both sides of the dvd. I've had it for years and noticed how easy the dvd's start to look worn. I'm actually on here now to order another set because the one I have, on the second side, the audio went crazy. There's not even scratches on the dvd so I don't know what's causing it. My reason was they should have shelled out a few more cents and made this dvd series on only one side of the discs instead of squeezing it on both sides.

In sci-fi, characterization can be more important than the story.  It's interesting to note that creator Kenneth Johnson wasn't involved for this miniseries...However, the TV series is utter rubbish.  NBC was drunk on the high ratings and rushed to get this series on television.  And WITHOUT Kenneth Johnson's blessing whatsoever...In fact, the production quality was so beyond belief that most of the original cast had quit by mid-season.Gone were the cool alien synth'ed voices.Mostly gone were the special effects.  Ship models were liberally re-used from both miniseries and, as the Visitors' gun effects had cost $2000 PER BOLT at the time, they were nixed almost completely from the full-fledged tv series, which was about as low-budget as they get, which is odd for a mid-1980s tv show where pointless plots and flashy effects could be seen from The A-Team to Knight Rider to virtually any prime time show of the time...Gone were plots that had some thought put into them, even if they weren't entirely realistic...What we got instead were the following:* Red dust no longer affects aliens, but only in warmer climates.  How convenient.  I will admit that it's reasonable to say that the bacteria in the dust can only survive in warm climates, but in terms of conquering a whole planet, they could have just as easily worn spacesuits over their bodysuits and be done with it.  Why do they need to take the time to meander over the dust?  (If nothing else, the revelation that the dust is harmful to all living life on the planet was a means of going somewhere with a continual plot, though ""The Final Battle"" went out of its way to say the dust was not harmful to humans, can they please make up their minds about it already...?)* Some silly bogus TV announcer at the start of the show, doing his best not to laugh at the script he'd been given to read.* Diana changes her hairstyle again (she really is vain, isn't she?)* Martin, one of the better characters both miniseries offered, gets killed - only to be replaced by a TWIN under the most ridiculous of circumstances (a bad guy who TURNS good, sheesh...)  Good grief, saying that another lizard liked Martin's human suit would have been much more palatable (though it still wouldn't have been)...  what's up with this bad-guy-gone-good twin nonsense?!* The episodes become pointless 'cat and mouse' scenarios where people basically get captured, only to escape once more to be able to destroy the super-weapon-of-the-week (tm).* Lots of Visitors are apparently vain, especially when it comes to their hair.  Another new character with a hair fetish, Lydia, is introduced...* Not to forget, with the red dust now apparently harmful - albeit in certain regions - Julie wants to go make a new version, oh joy...  why not have her goof up again and have her turn the Earth into one giant mushroom and be done with it?!* Worst of all, there's a Christmas-themed episode.  Mixing sci-fi with real-life holidays has never ever worked, and this show is hardly an exception.  Still, at least Donovan didn't turn to look square in the camera and wish all the children at home a merry Christmas (on the other hand, I'm almost surprised that he didn't...)I recall an alternative of the 2nd episode ""Breakout"" that was shot.  It's rumored to be quite good.  I have a friend with a bootleg copy, but from what I've read it sounds like that episode wasn't included on the set.Kenneth Johnson has written a new follow-up miniseries.  A new 2-parter that will air in 2005.  Some of the original stars will make return appearances.  But will fans accept a 60 year old Donovan and 50 year old Diana, bodysuit and all?!The DVD release claims there are 19 episodes.  Not forgetting the alternate ""Breakout"" episode that was made, there is an episode (#20) called ""The Attack"".  If the technical info Amazon.com claims is correct, what happened to ""The Attack""?  It was purportedly made.Now, let's also consider video quality.  When it comes to DVDs, DVD has been hyped up as a superior quality standard.  This means, with dual-layer media, anything more than 4 hours per disc will mean a grainy, less detailed image.  Well, this set contains 3 discs.  There are 19 episodes total.  As I recall, each episode is an hour long (50 minutes after commercials are cut out).  This means each disc is going to have at least 6 episodes on it, plus commentary sound tracks and irrelevant commercials for other products the DVD distributor slopped in.  I shudder to think of how bad these discs will look.On the other hand, NBC never put much effort into this TV show, so Warner probably put as much consideration into this release.  I say it's forgettable.True die-hard V fans will probably like this show, even though they are getting a raw deal.  It is kewl 80s nostalgia, even if it is cheap and spits on the effort that was put into both miniseries.  Or maybe I just didn't get into the prime time series as I had the two miniseries.",1,What a stinker of a turkey...,1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,5828,"['original', 'V', 'miniseries', 'had', 'strong',

Pretty much all the bad reviews are right (cheesy, poorly acted in some cases, bad FX, weird stunts, etc) but all the good reviewers are right too (fun action, great story arc throughout the whole series, great characters, etc.)I'm just so happy to have a continuation of the whole V experience.  I loved the mini-series like crazy.  It is awesome and stands up to the test of time with anything.  This series looks dated but I think they did the best they could with what they were given.  TV is not the movies and production values can't always be maintained.I think it was gutsy they decided to kill off certain members, made watching it more dramatic and tense.  After a while it got silly when people left but again, they did what they had to.And for those that feel misled by the DVD title, get a clue: it IS complete.

What you have is a  sci-fi series/WWII metaphor with some big star names. The villains Diana and Lydia were quite fun to watch as they sparred and plotted against each other while the resistance would routinely make fools of them on the surface below.
