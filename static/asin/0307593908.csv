Julie covers nearly every cooking technique you can think of live in front of you in her down-to-earth way.  It is so refreshing to watch her again after all these years!  She could be your mom or aunt right there teaching you what you need to know.  I just love the 80's footage--there is a Corning Ware Visions pan that Julia uses-I remember buying a set of these.  They actually are great for demonstrating cooking since you can see through them!  But I digress--these are the ""must have"" recipes in the poultry, meat, vegetable categories etc. with accompanying printed recipe book.  They build on one another and are explained very well with great camera angles.  She explains not only the recipes themselves but any type of prep, slicing, dicing, etc. that is necessary to start the recipe.  I even got use to her voice!If you are a beginning to intermediate cook or just want a good review, you must get this from the Master herself!",5,don't watch while you are hungry!,1283904000,"09 8, 2010",2010,981,"['awesome', 'instructional', 'video', 'Julie', 'nearly', 'cooking', 'technique', 'can', 'think', 'live', 'front', 'down-to-earth', 'way', 'so', 'refreshing', 'watch', 'again', 'years', 'could', 'be', 'mom', 'aunt', 'right', 'there', 'teaching', 'what', 'need', 'know', 'just', 'love', '80', 'footage', 'Corning', 'Ware', 'Visions', 'pan', 'Julia', 'uses-I', 'remember', 'buying', 'set', 'actually', 'are', 'great', 'demonstrating', 'cooking', 'can', 'see', 'digress', 'are', 'must', 'have', 'recipes', 'poultry', 'meat', 'vegetable', 'categories', 'etc', 'accompanying', 'printed', 'recipe', 'book', 'build', 'one', 'are', 'explained', 'very', 'well', 'great', 'camera', 'angles', 'not', 'only', 'recipes', 'type', 'prep', 'slicing', 'dicing', 'etc', 'necessary', 'start', 'recipe', 'even', 'got', 'use', 'voice', 'are', 'beginning', 'intermediate', 'cook', 'just', 'want', 'good', 'review', 'must', 'get', 'Master', 'herself']",N/A
510,A2IKWMHSHKRLGG,0307593908,Carlos A. Melendez,"[1, 1]","This has to be by far the BEST cooking DVD. Believe me when I tell you, if you buy this you will need no other.There are two DVDs that include :Poultry, Meat, Vegetables, Soups, Salads, Bread, Fish, Eggs, First Courses and Dessert. To give you an example on how the DVDs and classes work:Every class has a number Example: Sauteed Chicken is 101, you watch her prepare it, if for example there is an ingredient like saut&eacute;ed mushrooms that needs to be added then that preparation is 103, you can then stop and go to 103 and see how it's prepared, that way once you know how to prepare a recipe and want to just watch the steps, you don't have to watch every single step , just what you need. And for example after saut&eacute;ed chicken come recipes that have that same chicken as the base, so once you know how to saut&eacute; chicken you can then move on to Coq au vin or chicken with mushrooms and cream or chicken provencal, etc. all with saut&eacute;ed chicken as base. And believe me with Julia preparing you feel like you can do any of those recipes. She makes you feel very confident.The DVDs also come with a booklet, and not just a crummy pamphlet but a booklet with every recipe in the DVDs.I really believe that every household should have this, it is such an easy way to come together as a family and have dinner with great food that doesn't take forever to prepare in most cases. Forget fast food, here you have very good food made very quickly and you know each and every ingredient that goes into it.Bon app&eacute;tit!",5,Julia Child is the best.,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,1540,"['be', 'far', 'BEST', 'cooking', 'DVD', 'Believe', 'when', 'tell', 'buy', 'will', 'need', 'are', 'two', 'DVDs', 'include', 'Poultry', 'Meat', 'Vegetables', 'Soups', 'Salads', 'Bread', 'Fish', 'Eggs', 'First', 'Courses', 'Dessert', 'give', 'example', 'how', 'DVDs', 'classes', 'work', 'class', 'number', 'Example', 'Sauteed', 'Chicken', '101', 'watch', 'prepare', 'example', 'ingredient', 'saut', 'eacute', 'mushrooms', 'be', 'added', 'then', 'preparation', '103', 'can', 'then', 'stop', 'go', '103', 'see', 'how', 'prepared', 'way', 'once', 'know', 'how', 'prepare', 'recipe', 'want', 'just', 'watch', 'steps', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'watch', 'single', 'step', 'just', 'what', 'need', 'example', 'saut', 'eacute', 'chicken', 'come', 'recipes', 'have', 'same', 'chicken', 'base', 'so', 'once', 'know', 'how', 'saut', 'eacute', 'chicken', 'can', 'then', 'move', 'Coq', 'au', 'vin', 'chicken', 'mushrooms', 'cream', 'chicken', 'provencal', 'etc', 'saut', 'eacute', 'chicken', 'base', 'believe', 'Julia', 'preparing', 'feel', 'can', 'do', 'recipes', 'feel', 'very', 'confident.The', 'DVDs', 'also', 'come', 'booklet', 'not', 'just', 'crummy', 'pamphlet', 'booklet', 'recipe', 'DVDs.I', 'really', 'believe', 'household', 'should', 'have', 'such', 'easy', 'way', 'come', 'together', 'family', 'have', 'dinner', 'great', 'food', ""n't"", 'take', 'forever', 'prepare', 'most', 'cases', 'Forget', 'fast', 'food', 'here', 'have', 'very', 'good', 'food', 'made', 'very', 'quickly', 'know', 'ingredient', 'it.Bon', 'app', 'eacute', 'tit']",N/A
511,A1157CR0T5UM9D,0307593908,Evelyn Uyemura,"[29, 50]","Julia is delightful, as always. However, the cooking here is very basic and rather repetitive. In the meat section, you learn how to pan fry a steak and how to deglaze the pan and make a sauce. Then you have essentially the same thing for a pork chop and a veal cutlet. You learn how to make a pot roast, followed by the same instructions but with chunks of meat to make beef stew. In the vegetable section, you learn how to boil various vegetables and finish them off with a dab of butter. Very basic. Lots of butter, heavy cream, and wine or vermouth added to almost every dish. The videography is not very well-lit for close-ups, so some of the food looks rather unappealing. I think this would be useful for someone who wants to cook basic American food and only knows how to microwave.

There are thousands of books that teach recipes, but very few about techniques. That is where Mrs. Child breaks from most cooking instructors and where she leaves an important mark.By explaining, quickly and simply, the most useful methods in the preparations of foods, she makes clear, with positive attitude, enthusiasm and reassurance, how the novice cook can prepare meals expertly.The accompanying video series, now on DVD, does not have all the recipes listed in the book (that would take years to go through), but the techniques are all here, well organized and easy to master. I recommend both these videos and the book itself, for the latter goes into deeper details on how the theme-and-variation approach to recipes helps demystify cooking.Julia Child made a significant difference in my life.

It may turn out that all I need is this DVD, which by the way includes a recipe booklet for every recipe shown on the video.
