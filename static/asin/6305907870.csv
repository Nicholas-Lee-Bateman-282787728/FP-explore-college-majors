I have NEVER forgotten it, though I had to do a backwards search to determine that it was Alan Arbus who played Jesus parachuting from the sky (Arbus also played Dr. Sydney Freedman on the MASH television series.)  Can't say enough about it -- the symbolism, the sets, the acting, the plot are all superb.  This is perhaps the best parody ever -- and one that has not yet been re-discovered.

You kind of have an inkling that it had something to do with the New Testament and the Old/Wild West, but somewhere along the way SOMEBODY dropped the brown acid just to see if it was as bad as they said it was at Woodstock.  And you know what?  It was.This is a film you will want to show to your friends to see how they react...much like the British couple that kept the placenta from their most recent child's birth, made a pate and served it to friends at a dinner party.  Just remember...your friends may not feel up to operating a car or any other kind of heavy machinery after viewing this.Don't you want to buy it now?",4,This film will mess you up.,1029715200,"08 19, 2002",2002,796,"['good', 'thing', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'opted', 'run', 'credits', 'first', 'see', 'film', 'have', 'sit', 'try', 'process', 'exactly', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'kind', 'have', 'inkling', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'New', 'Testament', 'Old/Wild', 'West', 'somewhere', 'way', 'SOMEBODY', 'dropped', 'brown', 'acid', 'just', 'see', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'said', 'was', 'Woodstock', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'will', 'want', 'show', 'friends', 'see', 'how', 'react', 'much', 'British', 'couple', 'kept', 'placenta', 'most', 'recent', 'child', 'birth', 'made', 'pate', 'served', 'friends', 'dinner', 'party', 'Just', 'remember', 'friends', 'may', 'not', 'feel', 'up', 'operating', 'car', 'other', 'kind', 'heavy', 'machinery', 'viewing', 'this.Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'buy', 'now']",Greaser's Palace

He does quite a good job of it-their ecstasy is such that said surrey collapses. Was reminiscent of the fable of Krishna and the milkmaids (although this paralell theme here is handled with ridiculous, outrageous humor- that's fine, humor doesn't have to take a back seat to solemnity!).Also stuff about valuing humanity over technological comfort- meaning, as a cautionary not to become too enamored of the creation of man instead of recognizing the value of the creation of God.Also stuff about how some meanness in this world could be the result of dyspepticism.Good camera work. Good music (which creates a religious feel).Way to go, Robert Downey, Sr.!!!",5,Jesus-Krishna,1039996800,"12 16, 2002",2002,747,"['Jesus', 'young', 'woman', 'front', 'cab', 'surrey-with-the-fringe-on-top', 'quite', 'good', 'job', 'it-their', 'ecstasy', 'such', 'said', 'surrey', 'collapses', 'Was', 'reminiscent', 'fable', 'Krishna', 'milkmaids', 'paralell', 'theme', 'here', 'handled', 'ridiculous', 'outrageous', 'humor-', 'fine', 'humor', ""n't"", 'have', 'take', 'back', 'seat', 'solemnity', '.Also', 'stuff', 'valuing', 'humanity', 'technological', 'comfort-', 'meaning', 'cautionary', 'not', 'become', 'too', 'enamored', 'creation', 'man', 'instead', 'recognizing', 'value', 'creation', 'God.Also', 'stuff', 'how', 'meanness', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'result', 'dyspepticism.Good', 'camera', 'work', 'Good', 'music', 'religious', 'feel', '.Way', 'go', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Sr.']",Greaser's Palace

It's almost always a mercifully short review too because, well, where do you go from there; how do you prove a movie is pretentious or drivel? Strange films always have this potential which is why I generally cut to: Was it fun, weird, interesting, amusing, whatever?This is a fun film and it's full of surprises so it passes fine. Hey, I hated ""Being John Malkovich"" because there was little in the movie I hadn't seen before. It seemed like a compendium of the film maker's favorite oddball films. You want really oddball?
