1050205,A4064QHIQE96G,B000MRA58I,"Andrew Thomson ""12 year amazon customer""","[0, 0]","If I could give a split rating I would give the first hour of this film 4 stars, and the last 45 minutes two stars.The first hour of this documentary is pretty solid, and the subject matter is very interesting.  Whether you like the unusual music made by these artists or not, the film is fascinating for a good majority of it's runtime.The edit begins in a fairly tight documentary style with numerous interviews, various footage sources, stills, and many of the voices of the key players telling the story in prepared voice over.  A great job is done of helping the audience relate to this strange music, which does become more and more listenable as the film progresses.Then something strange happens just short of the one hour mark.  The footage becomes suddenly and drastically slower and less edited, the sources become less varied and the voice overs and interviews dwindle into the background, leaving the remaining 45 minutes a bit more ponderous than the subject merits.Perhaps the budget ran short 2/3 of the way through the edit.  This has happened to me and many other filmmakers, and it's very painful to deal with.  A great film has been mostly finished, but the remaining chunk of less finished documentary stands mired in a soup of boring, empty minutes of near nothingness.  A moving, life affirming pean to creativity and diversity in art becomes maddeningly slow and lifeless, unlike the vibrant creativity of the music featured.My guess is that given the needed budget these filmmakers could have made a great film out of this, if you watch the first hour and then stop, you will be carried along by their fine work.  The remaining 45 minutes seems only entertaining to die hard fans, despite the music getting more and more accessible through the course of the later half.  The filmmakers did a great job of snaring the audiences interest, so you may like me find yourself compelled to watch the whole thing, but then you may, like me, find your fondness for the film dimming to a blinding rage as something that started off interesting becomes ultimately boring.I hope they get the money to take another whack at the edit.  If it were one half hour to 45 minutes shorter, I'd give it 4 stars.And clearly the music merits taking the time to overcome the initial weirdness.  Every person has music inside them, some of us just sound very different, but the art that expresses oneself is truly great, even if it's very different from what came before.",3,"fascinating band, documentary is good for 1 hour, then slows down drastically",1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,2471,"['could', 'give', 'split', 'rating', 'would', 'give', 'first', 'hour', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'last', '45', 'minutes', 'two', 'stars.The', 'first', 'hour', 'documentary', 'pretty', 'solid', 'subject', 'matter', 'very', 'interesting', 'unusual', 'music', 'made', 'artists', 'not', 'film', 'fascinating', 'good', 'majority', 'runtime.The', 'edit', 'fairly', 'tight', 'documentary', 'style', 'numerous', 'interviews', 'various', 'footage', 'sources', 'stills', 'many', 'voices', 'key', 'players', 'telling', 'story', 'prepared', 'voice', 'great', 'job', 'done', 'helping', 'audience', 'relate', 'strange', 'music', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'listenable', 'film', 'progresses.Then', 'something', 'strange', 'just', 'short', 'one', 'hour', 'mark', 'footage', 'suddenly', 'drastically', 'slower', 'less', 'edited', 'sources', 'become', 'less', 'varied', 'voice', 'overs', 'interviews', 'dwindle', 'background', 'leaving', 'remaining', '45', 'minutes', 'bit', 'more', 'ponderous', 'subject', 'budget', 'ran', 'short', '2/3', 'way', 'edit', 'happened', 'many', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'very', 'painful', 'deal', 'great', 'film', 'been', 'mostly', 'finished', 'remaining', 'chunk', 'less', 'finished', 'documentary', 'stands', 'mired', 'soup', 'boring', 'empty', 'minutes', 'near', 'nothingness', 'moving', 'life', 'affirming', 'pean', 'creativity', 'diversity', 'art', 'becomes', 'maddeningly', 'slow', 'lifeless', 'vibrant', 'creativity', 'music', 'featured.My', 'guess', 'given', 'needed', 'budget', 'filmmakers', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'first', 'hour', 'then', 'stop', 'will', 'be', 'carried', 'fine', 'work', 'remaining', '45', 'minutes', 'only', 'entertaining', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'music', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'accessible', 'course', 'later', 'half', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'snaring', 'audiences', 'interest', 'may', 'like', 'find', 'compelled', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'then', 'may', 'find', 'fondness', 'film', 'dimming', 'blinding', 'rage', 'something', 'started', 'off', 'interesting', 'becomes', 'ultimately', 'boring.I', 'hope', 'get', 'money', 'take', 'whack', 'edit', 'were', 'one', 'half', 'hour', '45', 'minutes', 'shorter', ""'d"", 'give', '4', 'stars.And', 'clearly', 'music', 'taking', 'time', 'overcome', 'initial', 'weirdness', 'Every', 'person', 'music', 'just', 'sound', 'very', 'different', 'art', 'truly', 'great', 'even', 'very', 'different', 'what', 'came', 'before']",Danielson: A Family Movie
1050206,AH2NG0HB9DX6S,B000MRA58I,Ladfam,"[0, 0]","I've enjoyed the music of Daniel Smith and the Danielson Famile since around 1999.  Upon first listen, I simply thought the music was quirky.  (The Danielson Famile are widely considered an acquired taste.)  But after repeated listens, I enjoyed it more and more, which led me to buy all of their albums.  The spiritual themes are a large reason I'm drawn to these folks and their music, but the music is also catchy and often fun.Needless to say, I was excited when this DVD came out.  My family and I have watched it at least 4 times.  It is packed with live performances (including Daniel's thesis show), interviews, and lots of extras, including their music videos.  It's thoroughly enjoyable!",5,Super Documentary,1264032000,"01 21, 2010",2010,697,"[""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'music', 'Daniel', 'Smith', 'Danielson', 'Famile', '1999', 'first', 'listen', 'simply', 'thought', 'music', 'was', 'quirky', 'Danielson', 'Famile', 'are', 'widely', 'considered', 'acquired', 'taste', 'repeated', 'listens', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'more', 'led', 'buy', 'albums', 'spiritual', 'themes', 'are', 'large', 'reason', ""'m"", 'drawn', 'folks', 'music', 'music', 'also', 'catchy', 'often', 'fun.Needless', 'say', 'was', 'excited', 'when', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'family', 'have', 'watched', 'least', '4', 'times', 'packed', 'live', 'performances', 'including', 'Daniel', 'thesis', 'show', 'interviews', 'lots', 'extras', 'including', 'music', 'videos', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable']",Danielson: A Family Movie
1050207,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000MRA58I,Robert Moore,"[8, 13]","First, a personal note showing what a small world we live in.  I had ordered DANIELSON on Netflix, not knowing that Sufjan Stevens plays a major role on the disc.  So on Friday, before the disc arrived, I listened to ILLINOISE by Stevens and later that day watched the first three episodes of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.  Why is that relevant?  Because one of the episodes contains a really great cover of ""Devil Town"" by Daniel Johnston (it wasn't the Bright Eyes's cover from the Late, Great Daniel Johnston tribute album, but may have been based on it).  So I was really cognizant of how all things on the planet can somehow converge in unexpected ways when both Stevens and Johnston popped up in DANIELSON: A FAMILY MOVIE.As they note in the film, a lot of reviewers of their work feel compelled to define themselves before they go on to discuss the music.  I am not alone in this, though in my case the self-definition comes from a different direction.  I am a Christian so I am not put off or troubled by the content of the music of Daniel Smith.  I simply have never been able to enjoy the music of Danielson, Brother Danielson, or the Danielson Familie.  Ninety percent of it is Daniel Smith's voice.  I find his screeching falsetto to be the most unlikable voice in music.  This troubles me because I love the idea of the band, love all the people who are interviewed as human beings, and love the multiform character of Smith's artistic endeavors.  But I just don't like his voice.  It is what has kept me from liking any of Smith's projects.  On the other hand, I am a big fan of Sufjan Stevens, whose soft, gentle, and pure voice allows the beauty of his songs to pour through.  Smith's awkward falsetto acts more like a barrier to his music.  I realize that this is a purely personal response.  Many are not bothered by Smith's voice.  I am and it serves as a hindrance to my enjoying their music.  Which is a shame, because after seeing this film I like the concept of the Danielson Familie more than ever.The film does a first rate story of telling the story of the band, which was formed as part of Smith's college thesis.  It is a large family, the result of the marriage of a former nun and priest that encouraged their children to play around with music.  The family soon began bringing in others, whether friends such as Sufjan Stevens and Chris Palladino, or new family members via marriage.  As a fan of Sufjan Stevens, I found the film enormously illuminating for understanding his music better.  Knowing now more about his involvement with Danielson it is easy to hear that project's influence on his own solo work.  After watching this film and then listening to Stevens's albums they now sound like attempts to apply the aesthetic of that band to his own songs, and given that GREETINGS FROM MICHIGAN, SEVEN SWANS, and ILLINOISE all recorded in Daniel Smith's home studio, it might be difficult to underestimate the influence. Even if all those backup singers aren't the Danielson clan, the musical ideas are the same.  I kept wondering during the film if they would deal both with the success of Steven's Illinois album or Danielson's SHIPS album.  They do.One thing I like about Daniel Smith and his siblings and Sufjan Stevens is the different picture that they present of Christians.  On BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, the Cylon Sharon, who has changed sides because of her love for a human, tells her lover, ""I've tried to show them that not all Cylons are alike, that we're not all murderers.""  Similarly, Smith and Stevens have shown that not all Christians are the same, we are not all close-minded, willfully stupid bigots who are no fun and intolerant and conservative.  I doubt if Danielson has ever converted anyone to Christianity, but I suspect that they have done a world's of good in acting as good will ambassadors to the non-Christian world.  What so many evangelicals don't understand is that they are the worst conceivable advocates for Christianity.  What moderately intelligent person wants to belong to any club that Jerry Falwell, George Bush, Pat Robertson, Rick Santorum, or James Dobson belongs to?  These are horrible people and if being a Christian means being like them, what are most people going to say?  Speaking in New Testament terms, these people are ""stumbling blocks,"" preventing most non-Christians from seeing anything positive about Christianity.  But many people will be amazed that people who are actually fun and interesting like Stevens and Smith are Christians.  As with Cylons, not all Christians are the same.This DVD should be must viewing by anyone who is a fan of either Danielson or Sufjan Stevens.  Given his huge success the past couple of years, Stevens probably has more fans at present.  This album will explain where his music finds its roots.  But really this should be seen by anyone who wants to learn about some of the most interesting musicians working today.",5,A must see film for fans of Indie music,1178409600,"05 6,

1050209,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B000MRA58I,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[2, 2]","DANIELSON: A FAMILY MOVIE is a completely independently produced feature-length documentary about indie-rock musician, Daniel Smith, the former lead singer for ""The Danielson Familie"" who now works and tours as Brother Danielson. The movie explains how Smith first recruited his siblings to form the band as part of a college art project.  It follows the ups and downs of Danielson through the various transitions of the group as family members and close friends come and go.  The film also features the rise of Sufjan Stevens, a friend of the Smith family, who toured with the Danielson Familie but has achieved international popularity, critical acclaim, and success as a solo artist.  The film contrasts Stevens rise while Smith struggles. The film poses a lot of questions about being a Christian Artist and being relevant in the world.  For instance, does a Christian have to gain fame in order to make an impact upon people and in the world or is it enough just to be a musician, an Artist, playing for whoever who will listen? Parts of the story are told through a series of letters by each of the Smith's siblings who were involved with Danielson Familie.  Also interlaced are pieces of animation by Chris Palladino, family home videos, and interviews with concert-goers at various Danielson performances.I completely enjoyed DANIELSON: A FAMILY MOVIE.  The music isn't for everyone, but I found the story fascinating.  Highly recommended for fans of Danielson, anyone who enjoys good documentaries, and anyone who is interested in the challenges of being a Christian Artist.As for the extra features, I really enjoyed watching the extended interviews and conversations with concert-goers.
