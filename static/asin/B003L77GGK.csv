That being said, there were a few episodes in this season that were awesome, and I still say they've got some of the best lighting/directing on TV. I wish they'd do a bit less of the world saving and more of the classic older-style monster hunting. For me, they started slipping in season five. Oh well, its still good TV compared to most of what's offered.I just have one complaint about this season and its a writer complaint. Episode 21, Bobby is explaining to Dean who HP Lovecraft is and he says, ""At the Mountains of Madness, The Call of Cthulhu?"" to list some story titles Dean might recognize. Dean's answer is a questioning look and a dismissal. The writer missed the fact that Call of Cthulhu is also the name of a Metallica song. Dean, who frequently uses 'James Hetfield' as an alias, should have caught that and said something like, ""You mean like Metallica? Great song!"" Maybe have that song playing in the background at some point.  Tsk tsk tsk. Shame on you writer.

1351992,A3TKDDLMCYJKT1,B003L77GGK,"C. Chung ""Christopher Chung""","[19, 26]","I really hate to write a bad review of my absolute favorite show, but I don't have a choice.  Pretending things are all fine and well doesn't do anyone any good, and its intellectuality dishonest.After the fans reacted to the tedium and poor casting choices of Season 3, there was a dedicated and phenomenal course change going into Season 4 that breathed a vibrant new breath of life into the series, and it thankfully dissolved the boring stagnation of black-eyed demons and Buffy-babe clones that was Season 3's unfortunate hallmark.  This welcomed renewal lasted until the finale of Season 5.  If you haven't seen Seasons 4 and 5, you need to watch it now!Unfortunately the brilliance was short lived, and with Season 6 came the proverbial trainwreck.I.  My first gripe is the overall writing.  Season 6 is filled with writers who wrote half-assed episodes using half-assed monsters that are a shameful parade of what this show used to be about.  In my prior reviews of Supernatural seasons, I said:""The beauty of Supernatural for the first two years was it generally took lesser known monsters, urban legends, and other spooky stuff, and put a unique spin on it. The show would also introduce supernatural elements that were deliberately obscure, so if we didn't know about it from our own knowledge, we'd have to find out the details in real time with Sam and Dean. This kept things fresh by giving us a good mix of investigation and action.""And:""Another refreshing aspect of the show, is, it doesn't insult the audience. Existing horror conventions are borrowed, but almost all of them are updated into something new, as it successfully blends the insider info found in cult shows with the broader appeal of horror and action for the more mainstream audience. What we get is a hybrid of the two.""Unfortunately Season 6 throws all of that away by giving us some of the most boring, rehashed, and lazy episodes to date.  This season was also plagued with pointless monsters.  For example: Did we really need several more episodes about vampires---perhaps the lamest and most overused monster in pop culture next to zombies?  What, in six seasons did the show run out of monster ideas?  What, there weren't enough monsters in mythology world-wide so they had to go back to the most stereotypical and highlighted monsters that can be found everywhere else?  Another trap the writers fell into was continuing to rip off other shows, but the acknowledging the original source material in-episode as if that clears them of lazy writing.  I mean, c'mon, the Supernatural writers have their own world to create with their own rules!  Why on Earth would they have to have insipid ""Anne Rice rules"" for vampires or ""Star Trek rules"" for mind-control worms?  At the very least, I'm thankful when they pointlessly brought in H.P. Lovecraft, they didn't have Cthulhu end up being the ""end boss"".  That would have been a stupid and monumental sell-out.Along the same lines as above, I also have some issues with Sera Gamble, the replacement for Eric Kripke and the new creative head.  True to her name, her episodes are a gamble.  Like everyone, she has her pros and cons.  She is stunningly fantastic when she's writing the character of Death.  Her dialogue and plot writing for Death is solid gold.  But there-in lies the problem: she's a one trick pony, as most of the rest of her writing is dross.  Looking at all the episodes Gamble has written, she is perhaps the most uninspired and formulaic writer in the whole Supernatural stable.  With only a few exceptions here or there, too often her stories are just ripped off and repackaged plots tiredly taken from other sources.  The bottom line, is, I don't think she was the right choice to spearhead the show.  But Kripke seems to trust her, so maybe he sees something I don't.  Regardless, in the attempt to be fair, I'm still willing to give her a second chance with Season 7, but she has to step up her 'A Game' and get some new ideas to get this show moving in the right direction again.  Subpar or ""just ok"" episodes are not good enough, not when this show has been near-perfect in the past.A final gripe I have about the writing, is: I wish certain writers would keep their damn politics out of the show.  [They know who they are.]  Neither political party seems capable of doing the right thing, and both are screwing us over.  But I don't need one side's particularly tiresome propaganda or slant shoved down my throat.  I tune into this show to escape all the b.s. political wrangling in the real world, so the last thing I want to see, is it crop up its ugly head in-fiction.  There is no place for that in the Supernatural, and it's just a stupid move on the part of the writers.  This country is literally divided 50/50, so it's beyond stupid to potentially alienate half of the audience just to throw in some snarky partisan politics.  If one wants to advertise their own political beliefs, they can do so on their own time.  We don't need that crap here, as this show should not be a vehicle for any petty politics.II.  My second concern, is, this season started out very slowly and it needlessly ran us into several unnecessary dead ends that really didn't accomplish anything except waste our time, or kill off a few long-lasting guest star characters.  It also didn't seem to have a clear path.  The Purgatory arc might have been the overall plan, but it was painfully clear the first half of the season was just a shot in the dark by throwing anything and everything onto the wall to see what stuck.  And it was almost embarrassing watching each idea fail, and quickly be swept away.One specific example was the absolutely worthless ""Grandpa Campbell & Cousins"" arc that utterly bombed.  I really like Mitch Pileggli and Colin Nemec, especially since they were both 'Stargate' alumni, but their talent was utterly wasted as one dimensional cardboard cut outs.  This was so painful and so pathetic, it even translated into the show inadvertently when cousin Mark becomes the first cannon-fodder casualty.  When he died, no one even batted an eye, no one said anything, and it was like he didn't even exist.  Ironic, as that's how I felt too!  There was not one ounce of character development given to Mark, thus his death had no more impact than swatting a mosquito.  [And the same mostly held true with the rest of the Campbell clan later on.]  For a show that sometimes tends to go overboard on the crying, whining, man-tears, and emotional roller coasters, I found it very disingenuous that no one would even care he died.  But more to the point, it was an example of poor writing.  The ""arc"" with Eve was just as bad.  Haphazard build up, quick resolution, and very little satisfaction because it was pretty clear in her final appearance that she was just shallow plot-filler and time-killer to get to the finale.The most blatant and insipid travesty however, as the dreadful 'The French Mistake' episode that broke the fourth wall and tried to tell a story with the actors playing themselves.  It failed.  It failed miserably.  It wasn't funny, it wasn't clever, and it only severed as a lame and transparent self-indulgent piece for the crew that completely destroyed the suspension of disbelief.  'Wes Craven's New Nightmare' pulled the same stunt, but at least it tried to be serious.  Even 'Stargate SG-1' did a parody of itself, but that was both clever and funny.  The surname of this episode was aptly named.  It was a 'Mistake'.III.  Third, it was even more apparent the show's budget is practically non-existent:  Almost no classic rock.  Almost no location shoots in the first half of the season and more ""we have to save money so all we can do is shoot in a warehouse or the studio backlot, and redress the sets over and over again and pray the fans don't notice"" than the first two years of the 'X-Files'.  This is fine with the running gag of the motel rooms, but it's not cool with full episodes.  A show that survived six seasons should be getting a bigger budget because it has proven itself capable of lasting, not the reverse by getting a smaller and small budget each year and sabotaging all that it had built up.  Then we have the monster farce: ""We don't have any money for special effects or monster costumes, so every monster including dragons will be humans with fangs or weird eyes to indicate different monster races.""  I mean c'mon, why even green-light a dragon episode when they couldn't do them to begin with?!  Yeah, like men in business suits really work as ""dragons""...  Boring!  That was a short cut the various Star Trek shows used, except in that case it was just regular humans with slightly different noses...IV.  And finally, there's the pointless season finale.  Without giving away too much, it's just more of the same.  Of all the things they could do---of all the infinite possibilities of plot direction, the only thing they could think of, was to once again make us mistrust a good guy by seemingly turning someone evil.  Well yay...  Didn't we have to deal with that circular and done-to-death plot with Sam the last three years?  I mean c'mon, this is the best the show can come up with?  Drinking from the same well for the fourth time?!  And this was written by Kripke himself!  This endless farce of mistrust and corruption of the brothers or their allies is getting freaking old.  Been there, done that.  Ad nauseam.  Get some new material!  If the creative team or writing stable can't think of anything new for core character development, then they need to be replaced, or this show needs to end.  When I wrote my first review on Supernatural here on Amazon, I was floor by how brilliant it was, and I specifically mentioned how much I appreciated them taking their unique spin on things by being anti-formula.  But now I'm ready to drop the show---something unthinkable for me after the phenomenally good finale of Season 5, and I absolutely hate that I feel this way.  I love this show, I love the characters, and I love the idea behind it.  But man, they can do a helluva lot better than Season 6.Taking into account all I said, this does not translate to the cast.  As usual, the acting is excellent, and I'm not at all criticizing them.  [Though with that said, it is high-time for Sam to get a hair cut!]  In fact, they were the only saving grace for me.  Sam, Dean, Bobby, and Cas were the only reasons I kept coming back to watch when I started getting disillusioned.Yeah, this review was certainly a downer, and it pained me to write it.  But as I said before, with the bar having been set so high so early, I refuse to settle on anything less, and this season did not cut it.  It may be tolerable for fans of the actors or for more casual action/horror TV viewers, and that's cool.  But if you are a slightly more discriminating fan with a love of the show but no love for shortcuts or a drop in quality and presentation, this doesn't cut it.  Not by a long shot.  In fact, I can't even recommend purchasing this set, at least not until it drops in price.To its credit, Supernatural has a history of taking into account fan concerns, and proactively righting a wayward course.  Hopefully things will get better in Season 7...",2,"Endless warehouse episodes, small budget, and retcon in motion sadly tanks this season",1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,11257,"['really', 'hate',

1351993,A1RZ8PKX49BCEE,B003L77GGK,Charlie Gee,"[13, 14]","Similar to many other avid SUPERNATURAL fans, I am a bit disappointed with Season 6.  I just finished watching the DVD set (which, by the way, is once again well produced: it has easy to navigate discs, great sound and picture quality, interesting special features, and a great cover photo -- love the snake crawling up Sam Winchester's arm) and I have to tell you it was an uneven ride. As other reviewers have noted, the first 17 episodes are very scattered. Some are excellent while others, like ""The French Mistake"" are just plain bad. Taking Sam and Dean and placing them on the production stage of SUPERNATURAL takes the viewer out of the mythology and erodes the integrity of the characters for a bit of cheap self-adulation by the production staff.  The introduction of the Campbell cousins opened up some new possibilities for story archs, but the writers/producers/whoever decided to squander that by rapidly dispatching them in short order. (Bright spot: once dead characters return to life all the time on the show, so maybe we haven't seen the last of the Campbell cousins.) One episode has Dean Winchester running away like a scared little boy from a man who is following him. The next episode he's bad-mouthing a monster and staring him down. It's these types of character inconsistencies that have to leave us SUPERNATURAL fans scratching our heads and asking: ""Why?""On a more positive note, as with previous seasons, the acting overall is very good. Jim Beaver remains a true gift to the show and Jensen and Jared remain as charismatic as ever. The last five episodes I really liked. They helped to restore my faith that this show can continue to be great, although whether or not the character of Castiel is being developed wisely remains open for debate. Despite what I see as some weaker moments in Season 6, SUPERNATURAL is still a noteworthy show that manages to capture the imagination of its audience. It is worth adding to your collection. Hopefully Season 7 will see the boys returning to what I consider the series traditionally stronger characteristics: consistently high quality episodes, great monsters, tight pacing, addictive storylines, and less calling for help to angels.",3,BEING DEAD DON'T MEAN YOU'RE GONE,1316822400,"09 24, 2011",2011,2206,"['Similar', 'many', 'other', 'avid', 'SUPERNATURAL', 'fans', 'am', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'Season', '6', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'DVD', 'set', 'way', 'once', 'again', 'well', 'produced', 'easy', 'navigate', 'discs', 'great', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'interesting', 'special', 'features', 'great', 'cover', 'photo', 'love', 'snake', 'crawling', 'up', 'Sam', 'Winchester', 'arm', 'have', 'tell', 'was', 'uneven', 'ride', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'first', '17', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'scattered', 'are', 'excellent', 'others', 'French', 'Mistake', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'Taking', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'placing', 'production', 'stage', 'SUPERNATURAL', 'viewer', 'mythology', 'integrity', 'characters', 'bit', 'cheap', 'self-adulation', 'production', 'staff', 'introduction', 'Campbell', 'cousins', 'opened', 'up', 'new', 'possibilities', 'story', 'archs', 'writers/producers/whoever', 'decided', 'squander', 'rapidly', 'dispatching', 'short', 'order', 'Bright', 'spot', 'once', 'dead', 'characters', 'return', 'life', 'time', 'show', 'so', 'maybe', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'last', 'Campbell', 'cousins', 'One', 'episode', 'Dean', 'Winchester', 'running', 'away', 'scared', 'little', 'boy', 'man', 'who', 'following', 'next', 'episode', 'bad-mouthing', 'monster', 'staring', 'down', 'types', 'character', 'inconsistencies', 'have', 'leave', 'SUPERNATURAL', 'fans', 'scratching', 'heads', 'asking', 'Why', 'more', 'positive', 'note', 'previous', 'seasons', 'acting', 'overall', 'very', 'good', 'Jim', 'Beaver', 'true', 'gift', 'show', 'Jensen', 'Jared', 'remain', 'as', 'charismatic', 'ever', 'last', 'five', 'episodes', 'really', 'liked', 'helped', 'restore', 'faith', 'show', 'can', 'continue', 'be', 'great', 'not', 'character', 'Castiel', 'being', 'developed', 'wisely', 'open', 'debate', 'what', 'see', 'weaker', 'moments', 'Season', '6', 'SUPERNATURAL', 'still', 'noteworthy', 'show', 'capture', 'imagination', 'audience', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'Hopefully', 'Season', '7', 'will', 'see', 'boys', 'returning', 'what', 'consider', 'series', 'traditionally', 'stronger', 'characteristics', 'consistently', 'high', 'quality', 'episodes', 'great', 'monsters', 'tight', 'pacing', 'addictive', 'storylines', 'less', 'calling', 'help', 'angels']",Supernatural: Season 6

In spite of the fact that the writing is uneven (though getting better), the acting can be a bit over the top - or stiff - and they jump the shark more times than Fonzie on crack, I am still hooked on this show. I really do want to know what happens next. Does Sam keep on kicking @ss and taking names? Does Dean ever find true love and white picket fence happiness? Could both brothers please spend more time with their shirts off? Ahem... anyhow, I really enjoy the Crowley character -- wicked fun, the Devil we hate to love -- and Death is a very cool character too, just how I'd picture him, very gaunt and with his own blues soundtrack. Cass as God I'm not sure I buy; looks like he's being set up to Fall and become the next Lucifer. Hopefully the brothers get their respective acts together and save him from himself. The writers need to stop focusing on all the angst-ridden emotional bromance garbage they've been beating to death for the last two seasons or so.

1352015,A3A6O7SC8LKXDL,B003L77GGK,EPA316,"[0, 0]","I bought this dvd set with the anticipation of not liking it as much as the first 5 seasons, because my expectations were so high. To be fair, it's very hard to top releasing Lucifer from Hell and stopping the end of the world. I remember feeling a bit disappointed, just a little bit, when watching the episodes new on tv. However, when I went back and watched them again on dvd, for some reason, I found it a lot more entertaining than I remember.The problems with this season, in my opinion, are that the characters and plot seem to take a while to catch on. For example, seeing Grandpa Campbell was cool, but all of his other hunter relatives were killed off before we could figure out why we should care about them. The show spent many weeks building up the new villain, Eve, only to kill her off suddenly in a somewhat questionable way by Dean. Supernatural fell into the same trap that Smallville did when they spent all season building up Doomsday, then rapidly got rid of him in an unsatisfying way after a very short confrontation. The biggest problem with this season, really, is that the plot spun its wheels for so long. Too many questions, not enough answers. In season 5, the mission was clear from the start: fight Lucifer, stop the apocolypse. Clear enough. This time around, not so much.So, having said all that, there was a whole lot of good stuff in this season as well. First and foremost is Jensen Ackle's directing in ""Weekend at Bobby's."" That was a very good episode. Seeing Sam and Dean as babysitters was funny, and I am one of the ones who loved ""The French Mistake."" It's great when a show can poke fun at itself like that, and I hope they do another one like this. I also liked Dean as a reaper for 24 hours.

The season gives you a bit of a different perspective on Dean and Sam - in a way they almost switch roles, with Sam being more of the tough guy and Dean more of an emotional character. If you like the character Bobby, his presence in this season seems a bit more robust than in others.

I think that more time should have been given to Soulless Sam, although I sort of get why they cut it short -- while I like Jared P. as Sam, he is not the best actor in the world and moving him to lead over Jensen A. hurt the show.  As a result, we wound up with an abbreviated subplot rather than an arc that could carry the season.  Another mistake was the Lisa/Ben/Dean story.  Everytime you thought you had seen the last of Lisa and Ben, they just kept popping up for no particular reason, since it was clear to all from the second episode, that the relationship was over, and it seemed like the nail was finally put in the coffin with ""The Episode of Truth.""  It seemed almost as if the people in charge of the show liked the characters and could not let them go even though they made no inherent sense to the development of either the Dean character or the overall plot.  While I personally don't mind Dean actually having a love interest as a means of developing his character, in order for it to work the actors need to have chemistry together and Dean and Lisa did not. I also hate what was done with Castiel, but I am willing to reserve final judgment until this season before declaring that a bust.  The killing of Rufus was just wrong on so many levels as he added to the overall story every time he was on, and could have made a great companion/counterbalance to Bobby.

It means everyone and everything is facing double choices, if not twice double or even three times double. Things become very complicated and at the end you are just amazed that all our ""friends"" have survived. At the same time it seems that complexity is the fact that several lines are used at the same time to create havoc and chaos. The line of the stealing of God's weapons is hardly used twice with the Staff of Moses and Gabriel's Horn of Truth, though this one was a false alarm. This use of that line seems to be a diversion in the season, though it brings a nice diversion in the plot by throwing Sam and Dean onto the set of the TV series known as Supernatural and then they are confronted with their ""civilian"" identities and realities while Castiel is planning the capture of the keys to the cupboard or cabinet or closet in which God's weapons are stored. When Castiel finally succeeds against Crowley, the demon Virgil and the ambushed Raphael, he brings the boys back into their real world of Supernatural.Another line is more consistent in the season. It is the line of the Mother of All, though it is a side line too. It is essential because it crosses many episodes. It is important too because it reveals something about the Campbells, the ""family"" of Samuel Campbell, the grandfather, dead and damned but brought back by Crowley for a very special mission. He, surrounded by his grandchildren (Sam as well, but not Dean at first), is tracking down what is called Alphas, the first monster of each kind, in order to get access to Purgatory. Being hunted, all the various types of monsters react by awakening their original creator, their mother, called the Mother of All and named Eve. Brought on Earth, Eve will try to protect her children against the more and more aggressive hunters.This line is very disruptive because to kill the Mother of All, who is transforming everyone she touches into Jefferson Starships (an invention of the Winchesters), Starships for short, monsters of a new hybrid nature, to kill her they need the ashes of a Phoenix, which is rare. That leads them back to Samuel Colt (another Samuel, another Sam) we already know since he is the one who built the giant Devil's trap that blocked the Devil's Gate that was opened in an earlier season. Dean and Sam need then to go back to March 5, 1861 when according to his journal, Colt killed a phoenix. That gives us a nice remake of a remake of a Clint Eastwood film via Back to the Future. The Phoenix was hanged in a small frontier place and he revived on the following morning and came back to burn the three people he considered miscarried justice. Which he does. But Dean has become the sheriff in the mean time and Sam is trying to bring Colt and instead of the man he will bring THE Colt that can kill demons and phoenixes. Sam will arrive just in time to give the gun to Dean who will summon Flinch (that's the name of the phoenix) to a duel in the main street and he will kill the Phoenix who will burn down into ashes. But Castiel will bring them back before they could collect the prize and without bringing the gun back. Luckily the US Postal Service delivers a package from a certain Samuel Colt that contains the ashes, a letter and a broken portable telephone Dean or Sam had left behind, but not the Colt.This episode will lead to the confrontation with the Mother of All and she will ask Dean and Sam to become her allies. Dean will refuse blankly and provoke her into biting him, which was deadly for her because Dean had gotten a refill in Phoenix ashes just before. Then Castiel and Crowley clean up the plate.That leads us to the first and essential complication  of this season: the couple Castiel Crowley who are dancing page after page between life, death and eternal anything (life, death, void, suffering, enjoying, you name it you have it).Sam was brought back at the beginning of the season from the cage where he was locked up with Lucifer, Michael and of course his half brother Adam. It remains a well kept secret about who did it. It will be revealed later on it was Castiel. But this Sam is soulless and is recuperated by another revived corpse, Samuel Campbell, the grandfather who was killed in some earlier season. But it is revealed then that this Samuel was brought back up by Crowley, the King of Hell in the absence of Lucifer, who wanted two things: a guarantee and some servants. He will get the guarantee from Bobby who will accept to give him his soul for ten years provided he saved Sam. But that was a lure. On the other side Crowley wants Samuel Campbell and some others in his family on the Campbell's side (some being possessed demons) to work for him under the promise he will bring Mary Campbell, the mother of Dean and Sam, back to life. The job is to capture monsters, especially alpha-monsters (first monster on a line) For Samuel or Crowley to torture them in order to get from them the location of the gate to Purgatory.But at the same time Castiel wants access to this Purgatory (and we can imagine Raphael wants it too) in order to recuperate the millions upon millions of souls there that would give the person who will get them a phenomenal power. The war then is a war between three people, in the absence of Lucifer and God, the King of Hell, Crowley, the angel Castiel and the Archangel Raphael. The one who will get these Purgatory souls will be the new god. You can imagine the consequences with Crowley (hell on earth and in the universe), Raphael who is the fundamentalist in the angelic family and wants to restart the Apocalypse which has to happen because god has said so, even in his absence, and the small little rank and file angel Castiel who does not want that apocalypse to be reopened and who wants to manage the world and the universe in a gentler way.Before getting to the final battle, the series has to solve some secondary issues.First it has to enable Bobby to recapture his soul from Crowley. That will be difficult since they will have to go to Scotland to dig up the bones of his human identity and menace him to burn them if he does not do what he is asked to do. He will be incited into doing that by the presence of the ghost of his son who has given all kinds of nasty details about his father, which is not surprising in two ways. The son is a fink because the father was a turd, and the father is in hell and has managed to get to the top because he was a metaphorical shark and a metaphorical ghoul and a metaphorical vampire in his real life. The son merely had to give away anything but his father's tomb location, in order for the two Winchesters to get the bones. Of course the Winchetsers and company make the mistake not to keep the bones after Crowley yielded, so that they lost their power over him. Crowley rushed to Scotland to gather his bones and hide them away.In fact the bones will have another episode: Castiel will find them and he will try to get some information about Purgatory and the Mother of All from Crowley along with the Winchesters. Crowley will refuse and Castiel will burn the bones and Crowley. But it will appear later on that at least not all the bones were burnt, if any of them at all since Crowley will survive his burning episode and come back with a vengeance but also with a pact with Castiel. And that is where the plot sickens. Castiel staged up the death of Crowley himself to keep his dealing with him under the table, if not the carpet.Another side line is that of dragons. To kill dragons you have to have a blade that was soaked in the blood of a dragon. To kill a dragon you must already have killed one. The impossible vicious circle. If you want the first wound you may inflict to a dragon is not mortal since so far the blade had not been dipped in dragon's blood. But the second blow, if you have the opportunity to do so, will be deadly. Dean and Sam find such a sword in the home of a San Francisco University professor, Ellie Visyak. It is slightly difficult to get it out of the piece of rock in which it is embedded, but with dynamite, more Nobel than noble, at least if it were not plastic of some kind, Dean manages to get it, or at least a long ands sharp enough piece of it for the job. And the dragons get destroyed.This side story will become essential later.Another side story is the calling of fairies by a clockmaker who has Parkinson's disease. The fairies work for him, drink milk, but they also capture the first born son of any family to serve their king Oberon. Dean is at stake because he is a first born. The shortcoming of fairies is that when they come across a pile of powder sugar they are compelled by their instinct to count the grains. That will enable Dean to remain with us. The ritual will be reversed and the fairies will go back and the clockmaker will retire.Another side story has to do with skinwalkers. Dogs are not that friendly you know. Some of them and more and more are skinwalkers. They can change into men if they want and their target is to multiply as dogs and sooner or later answer the call and take over the humans and then they will be the new human race. Sam and Dean have to clean up a pack of them in a city and that is difficult indeed, but they manage because to do their business these skinwalkers have to be in human form. So one is captured and he is used in human form to bait the others and the plan works so well they are all killed, except the one who was the bait, only wounded in his dog's form and he goes away. That will lead to a very sad moment when he will try to confront the wife and child of the man he had actually killed and they know he had done it.That's now time to come back into the picture of the season. Opening Purgatory.But before it all we have to enter the recapturing of Sam's soul. To make things short, let me say it is Death, contacted by Dean, who will bring that soul back. That will mean a side-story since Dean will have to be Death for 24 hours, and he failed. Death however holds his promise. So Sam has his soul back, in fact only part of this soul: all that happened in the pit has not been erased because it is un-erasable, but has been locked up inside a wall or behind a wall and that wall has to remain intact, otherwise tremendous suffering will happen. Castiel is strictly opposed to that transaction and it reveals that since he brought Sam back, he is the one who decided to bring Sam back without his soul for reasons that are definitely not clear. But Castiel is at times weird in this season and over-empathetic concerning the ""family"" that Dean, Sam and Bobby would be to him, as if an angel had and needed to have a family, apart from God who is their fathers and other angels and archangels who are their brothers, and maybe sisters after all since an angel is at least androgyneous. Note angels are soulless too.H.P. Lovecraft provides the track to the key to purgatory. On March 15 1937 with six other believers he performed a ritual to open the door and they succeeded, though no one, except a boy witness knows. One person came out, a monster for sure, we will never know its shape, and the door will close back. This monster will take the form of the boy's mother and this boy's mother is no one else but Ellie Visyak. It is Bobby who discovers the fact and Ellie is a good friend of his. So he warns her that all demonic and angelic forces are running after her. She took the warning too lightly and she got trapped by Castiel.Castiel had an agreement with Crowley. As soon as he gets the blood of a native of purgatory he rejects his pact and Crowley has to run. But he comes back to confront Castiel with Raphael. He had changed his alliance. Raphael at that moment appears as a black woman. So Castiel goes away. But the jar of blood he had left behind is not Ellie's blood but dog's blood. So Crowley and Raphael perform a rite that does not work.In the mean time Sam had gone down at Bobby's. He is unconscious. In fact we are provided with a story of what is happening to him. He is in a dream in which he has been exploded into three entities, three pieces. The first one that has little memory is the Sam with his soul, in fact he seems to be essentially the soul that death had delivered to him and has lost all memory of before right now and who he was. He is helped by a waitress and he manages to be attacked and confront the second Sam, the Sam without his soul, the Sam that came back from the pit, nothing but the body. He kills that Sam and recuperates his body and physical memory. But the warning is: wait and see till you meet the third one. The third one is his soul as it was burning in the pit, his full soul memory, and that third Sam is killed by the first reunified Sam and the third piece gets into him. He has recaptured his full soul memory and that hurts.This leads us to the end. Dean and Bobby arrive at the place where Castiel and Crowley are supposed to meet. They arrive when the host of spirits arrive with Crowley and Raphael for their vengeance. They crawl out of the car and they witness Crowley and Raphael performing the ritual that fails. Castiel arrives then and reveals that the blood they had used was not the good one and he brings the jar of good blood but the jar is empty. He has performed the ritual and he has the souls. He makes Crowley disappear and he destroys the black lady Raphael. Then a completely deranged Sam arrives from behind and stabs Castiel in the back with no effect.The story is closed there and Castiel says: ""I am not an angel anymore. I am the new god. You bow down and profess your love or I'll destroy you. You are not my family."" All that in spite of all the brotherly love and human empathy and friendship he had expressed to Dean and Sam. It is the underling that captured the supreme power of souls who has become the new god, all powerful, omniscient and ever present in space and time. Who can trust such an underling?I guess the answer is in the next season, the season that is running right now.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVE",5,The sloppy rank and file individual

1352040,AS9LEMR7P3FA3,B003L77GGK,"Jie Chung ""holyjiebus""","[1, 1]","If I had to compare this season to a movie in a series, it probably be Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. You know that the stakes are high in the movie and that the fate of the world hangs on the balance with John Conner and ""Ah-nold,"" but you just never take as seriously as T2 because every other scene has you bursting with laughter. Well this show had me laughing in EVERY episode...but in a good way.The story line for this season is good, but in my opinion not as ""stakes are so high"" story-lines as season 2, 3, 4, and 5. In fact I felt that this season took the story to a more personal importance, along the lines of season 1 and 3 as opposed to ""oh no the world is coming to an end, we have to figure out a way to stop it!"" Season 1 was trying to figure out where the brothers stood in terms of fighting the yellow-eyed demon, and season 3 was Sam trying to find a way to save his brother Dean from going to hell, and I felt the same type of personal urgency from this season as those two seasons.This time Dean has to save Sam (spoiler alert!) by finding his soul. Sam is a walking, empty husk with no soul inside, but also an emotionless, uncaring psychopath who will do anything to finish a ""job"" - even risking the life of his own brother Dean. So you can imagine how much personal conflicts arise with this predicament and how many times the show can get really emotional. However, at the same time I have to say that this season was also the funniest season.For example, looking at the ""The French Mistake"" episode, (where the brothers go to an alternate reality where they find they are only actors named Jensen/ Jared who only act like they are killing monsters and there are no real monsters, demons, or angels) where the two brothers spend nearly 5 minutes doing a take on a scene over and over again, which was handled brilliantly by Jensen/ Jared. The two actors acted so well that they didn't know how to act that it was believable and kept me laughing for the duration of the scene. I haven't laughed like that since Will Farell was having a heartfelt convo in a fish suit with his basketball team in ""Semi-pro.""All in all, I would not say that this season was the BEST season out of the 6, but you can tell the producers were trying to approach season six a little bit differently than seasons 4 and 5, where nearly the whole season had apocalyptic feel. This one was more like - hm, things are pretty bad, but the brothers are having fun while they're trying to figure things out and get to know each other all over again. Don't get me wrong, this season has drama like the previous seasons, but it was refreshing to get away from the whole apocalyptic sense and see the brothers interact more leisurely rather than think the clock was always against them because...season 7 is gonna get REAL apocalyptic (BIG spoiler alert) with Castiel becoming god-like/ insane towards the end of season 6.",5,"The Funniest Season out of the Six, but still a Romp to Watch",1316995200,"09 26, 2011",2011,2920,"['had', 'compare', 'season', 'movie', 'series', 'probably', 'be', 'Terminator', '3', 'Rise', 'Machines', 'know', 'stakes', 'are', 'high', 'movie', 'fate', 'world', 'balance', 'John', 'Conner', 'Ah-nold', 'just', 'never', 'take', 'as', 'seriously', 'T2', 'other', 'scene', 'bursting', 'laughter', 'Well', 'show', 'had', 'laughing', 'EVERY', 'episode', 'good', 'way.The', 'story', 'line', 'season', 'good', 'opinion', 'not', 'stakes', 'are', 'so', 'high', 'story-lines', 'season', '2', '3', '4', '5', 'fact', 'felt', 'season', 'took', 'story', 'more', 'personal', 'importance', 'lines', 'season', '1', '3', 'opposed', 'oh', 'world', 'coming', 'end', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'stop', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'brothers', 'stood', 'terms', 'fighting', 'yellow-eyed', 'demon', 'season', '3', 'was', 'Sam', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'save', 'brother', 'Dean', 'going', 'hell', 'felt', 'same', 'type', 'personal', 'urgency', 'season', 'two', 'seasons.This', 'time', 'Dean', 'save', 'Sam', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'finding', 'soul', 'Sam', 'walking', 'empty', 'husk', 'soul', 'inside', 'also', 'emotionless', 'uncaring', 'psychopath', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'finish', 'job', 'even', 'risking', 'life', 'own', 'brother', 'Dean', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'much', 'personal', 'conflicts', 'arise', 'predicament', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'show', 'can', 'get', 'really', 'emotional', 'However', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'say', 'season', 'was', 'also', 'funniest', 'season.For', 'example', 'looking', 'French', 'Mistake', 'episode', 'where', 'brothers', 'go', 'alternate', 'reality', 'where', 'find', 'are', 'only', 'actors', 'named', 'Jensen/', 'Jared', 'who', 'only', 'act', 'are', 'killing', 'monsters', 'are', 'real', 'monsters', 'demons', 'angels', 'where', 'two', 'brothers', 'spend', 'nearly', '5', 'minutes', 'doing', 'take', 'scene', 'over', 'again', 'was', 'handled', 'brilliantly', 'Jensen/', 'Jared', 'two', 'actors', 'acted', 'so', 'well', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'act', 'was', 'believable', 'kept', 'laughing', 'duration', 'scene', 'have', ""n't"", 'laughed', 'Will', 'Farell', 'was', 'having', 'heartfelt', 'convo', 'fish', 'suit', 'basketball', 'team', 'Semi-pro', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'season', 'was', 'BEST', 'season', '6', 'can', 'tell', 'producers', 'were', 'trying', 'approach', 'season', 'six', 'little', 'bit', 'differently', 'seasons', '4', '5', 'where', 'nearly', 'whole', 'season', 'had', 'apocalyptic', 'feel', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'hm', 'things', 'are', 'pretty', 'bad', 'brothers', 'are', 'having', 'fun', ""'re"", 'trying', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'over', 'again', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'season', 'drama', 'previous', 'seasons', 'was', 'refreshing', 'get', 'away', 'whole', 'apocalyptic', 'sense', 'see', 'brothers', 'interact', 'more', 'leisurely', 'rather', 'think', 'clock', 'was', 'always', 'season', '7', 'gon', 'get', 'REAL', 'apocalyptic', 'BIG', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'Castiel', 'becoming', 'god-like/', 'insane', 'end', 'season', '6']",Supernatural: Season 6

Season three had it's great moments and season 4 and 5 were mindblowingly good, so it makes you begin to ask: when are the writers going to run out of steam?  Or when are the main actors going to get sick of their roles, which usually happens in something as long running as this.  However this was not the case.  Once again, Supernatural tops itself with great acting, clever writing and excellent direction.  First of all, Jared, Jensen, Misha and Jim Beaver are and will always be awesome actors.  I wish i had a quarter of the talent that these guys have.  Crowley and Balthazar are also characters where the actors are splendid.  Rufus is brilliant!  To see Ellen again is a pleasant and wonderful surprise.  Not to mention, the guest stars and ensemble cast are also flawless.And as for the writing, there are so many great episodes in this season that it leaves me speechless.  For example there's Two and a half men, the third man, frontierland, weekend at bobby's, like a virgin, death at samarrah, you can't handle the truth, clap your hands if you believe, unforgiven, the man who would be king, mommy dearest, my heart will go on, the french mistake. the man who knew too much, and caged heat, are all great episodes.  And I'm pretty sure there are some other good ones that I'm forgetting in there too.And the funny thing is I am not a horror fan at all.  I never like to watch scary movies and I am a hopeless Jane Austen/Bronte fan where I love to re-watch old classics. Don't get me wrong, I love action/super hero movies also, and artsy stuff like Coraline, Stardust, and Nightmare Before Christmas.

However, Season 6 had about four to six that were really weak. It definitely picks up steam toward the end of the season, but so much potential was squandered early on. I didn't mind that Dean Winchester found a temporary love interest, but his role in the season seemed under written. It was like his job was to spend most of the time reacting to Sam Winchester's return from hell, Sam's changed personality, Sam's loss of his soul, Sam's need to get his soul back, and so on. Meanwhile, Dean's issues made up all of about four episodes, most of which felt forced and uneven. There were also some disappointing red herrings, including the ""Mother of All"" subplot that went no where slowly, and the ""Alphas"" subplot which started well, but never developed.It wasn't a bad enough season to lose me as a viewer, but let's hope Season 7 doesn't turn out to be another year of Dean reacting to Sam's problems.",3,Probably the least of the six seasons,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,1168,"['reviewers', ""'m"", 'major', 'fan', 'show', 'also', 'disappointment', 'Season', '6', 'Critics', 'have', 'called', 'messy', 'place', 'unfocused', 'etc', 'true', 'season', 'show', 'had', 'few', 'episodes', 'missed', 'mark', 'However', 'Season', '6', 'had', 'four', 'six', 'were', 'really', 'weak', 'definitely', 'up', 'steam', 'end', 'season', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'was', 'squandered', 'early', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'Dean', 'Winchester', 'found', 'temporary', 'love', 'interest', 'role', 'season', 'seemed', 'written', 'was', 'job', 'was', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'reacting', 'Sam', 'Winchester', 'return', 'hell', 'Sam', 'changed', 'personality', 'Sam', 'loss', 'soul', 'Sam', 'need', 'get', 'soul', 'back', 'so', 'Meanwhile', 'Dean', 'issues', 'made', 'up', 'four', 'episodes', 'most', 'felt', 'forced', 'uneven', 'were', 'also', 'disappointing', 'red', 'herrings', 'including', 'Mother', 'All', 'subplot', 'went', 'where', 'slowly', 'Alphas', 'subplot', 'started', 'well', 'never', 'developed.It', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'season', 'lose', 'viewer', 'let', 'hope', 'Season', '7', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'year', 'Dean', 'reacting', 'Sam', 'problems']",Supernatural: Season 6

It has all the elements that make a show Great. You have the big dysfunctional family fall out after the boys lose Mary and John goes absolutely bats*** crazy Hunting for the ""Yellow Eyed Demon"". It amazes me that Dean is still the strong one, even after everything he has had to do and put up with all for Sam. When they switched things up and added in the Angels, especially Castiel (Misha Collins) I was blown away!  He still keeps us all guessing, especially about himself and Dean, plus that ""special"" relationship, The link that still ties them together ever since he yanked Dean out of Hell. I cried when Dean died, I cried when he came back and I totally lost it at the end of Season 5 ""Swan Song"". I was so upset when Lucifer snapped Bobby's neck and that assshat snapped his fingers to kill OUR Castiel.When Chuck is seen at the beginning of that Episode writing about the Impala, Dean's one true Love, we all grabbed tissue boxes and settled in for what we knew was going to be one Amazing episode. The final shot of Sam and Adam falling into that swirling vortex to hold Lucifer and Michael, Dean's broken and shattered heart as he kneels staring at the spot where he lost HIS Sammy. Chuck all clean and leaving us ALL wondering when he just disappeared, Was he really God?Season 6 has been strange to say the least. As a community, us Fans have been reserving judgment until we see the whole package. It's all about the whole package. We will keep watching even if (God forbid) this is the last Season, and hold out hope that we see more of Castiel as he fights Raphael for Heaven , I want to know more about the ""Missing"" Heavenly objects. Maybe then I'll be happy, until the Season ends I WILL keep watching.This episode was so great and different, especially the opening sequence. The fact that UFO's and Fairies were involved had me hooked regardless of how they did it. If you are a ""True"" fan, then this one is some necessary comedy relief.

I believed in Sera Gamble as she had written a few of my favorite episodes from previous seasons (Jus in Bello, anyone?). I call this an encore season because, more than before, oldies but goodies come back for new (and often final) performances. Folks you thought you never would see again come back not just for cameos and ""Hey it's me"" effects but are vital elements of certain episodes.I have to admit, though, that the first two episodes are painfully slow paced and have syrupy dialogue that sounds like it is from a Lifetime Channel Halloween Special. However, from the third episode on, the pace gets back on track and the new story arc is introduced. I liked that the arc wasn't as tunnel visioned as in Season 3 when you knew that nothing big would have happened until the final episode (I loved that season but you knew nothing would be resolved until the end which cut back on re-watch value). There are a few surprises not revealed til the very end which then gives rise to even greater questions.The balance of visits from long gone characters both old and new and an interesting and ambitious story arc make Season 6 a great season. Sera Gamble was very wise to not try to one-up Season 5 but go in her own direction and cut the way for giving non-demon or angel related monsters their due. I liked it.

It is by far a miss compared to the first four season, back when I called this my favorite series.  I wanted it to be great, but each episode threw stuff at a wall hoping something would stick.  The heart which is the relationship of the brothers had failed.  They threw out the characters of Sam and Dean for unrecognizable doubles who forgot what made them different. What happened to Sam's powers.  I loved the Luke Skywalker/ Han Solo likeness of the first few seasons.  I loved when the boys where part of the mythos rather then powerless spectators.  Characters grow true, Sam was soulless but still this season just missed the target.

1352103,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B003L77GGK,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[4, 4]","""Supernatural"" was always meant to be five seasons long so when the show was renewed for two additional seasons the five year plan that creator Erick Kripke had in mind went out the window and so did Kirpke who although is still a consulting producer (and wrote the season finale for season six)stepped aside and writer/co-producer Sara Gamble took the reins.Although not as consistent as previous seasons ""Supernatural"" struggled to establish a consistent tone during the sixth season of the series. Nevertheless, the sixth season had a number of strong episodes including a couple of tongue-in-cheek classics written by writer/co-producer Ben Edlund (""The Tick"").Introducing Sam and Dean's relatives as hunters was a great concept that wasn't developed as fully as it could have been; Sara Gamble and the other writers introduced a number of interesting characters including Sam and Dean's grandfather returning but didn't develop the characters as well as they could have. It's a pity because I think they could have built a couple of good episodes around the ""hunter"" family exploring their dynamic and relationship and eliminated a couple of the weaker episodes involving Sam & Dean's characters (or had them as peripheral characters much as they are in the episode ""Weekend at Bobby's"").SPOILERS:When we last saw Sam he descended to Hell with Luicifer's personna trapped inside him. Dean adopts a normal family life finding a peace he never had when he was raised. This lasts for a year but it seems like an eternity to Sam. When Sam mysteriously returns he lures Dean back into hunting but Dean finds Sam has changed--he's amoral and seems to delight in the torture of others something Sam would never do. Dean discovers that Sam has returned in body but he has no soul.END OF SPOILERS:The Blu-ray looks positively stunning--with a sharp, desaturated presentation true to the look of the original broadcast. Audio is presented in HD 5.1 lossless quality.The extras include commentary tracks on Ben Edlund's amusing ""Clap Your Hands If You Believe"" and ""The French Mistake"" (by Edlund, producer Sara Gamble and director Robert Singer). The latter has an interactive trivia track for the Blu-ray.We also get a featurette on Jensen Ackles turn behind the camera for ""Weekend at Bobby's""; the last two episodes for ""Supernatural: The Animated Series"" ""All Hell Breaks Loose"" parts I and II are also include; we also get outtakes/alternate takes for ""The French Mistake"".The Blu-ray also includes ""The Hunter's Guide"" an interactive feature with exclusive featurettes on the production of the series buried within it. The special features are wrapped up with ""Supernatural: The Quest for the Soul"" a featurette on season six and the gag reel for the sixth season.While season six was a bit uneven taking awhile to find it's footing, once the sixth season did discover the tone for the season there were a number of outstanding episodes. Part of that issue was due to the switch over in producers but the main reason was that the show was originally designed as a five season series.Recommended.",4,Very good but uneven sixth season-exceptional looking Blu-ray set,1315872000,"09 13, 2011",2011,3096,"['Supernatural', 'was', 'always', 'meant', 'be', 'five', 'seasons', 'long', 'so', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'renewed', 'two', 'additional', 'seasons', 'five', 'year', 'plan', 'creator', 'Erick', 'Kripke', 'had', 'mind', 'went', 'window', 'so', 'did', 'Kirpke', 'who', 'still', 'consulting', 'producer', 'wrote', 'season', 'finale', 'season', 'six', 'stepped', 'aside', 'writer/co-producer', 'Sara', 'Gamble', 'took', 'reins.Although', 'not', 'as', 'consistent', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Supernatural', 'struggled', 'establish', 'consistent', 'tone', 'sixth', 'season', 'series', 'Nevertheless', 'sixth', 'season', 'had', 'number', 'strong', 'episodes', 'including', 'couple', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'classics', 'written', 'writer/co-producer', 'Ben', 'Edlund', 'Tick', '.Introducing', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'relatives', 'hunters', 'was', 'great', 'concept', 'was', ""n't"", 'developed', 'as', 'fully', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Sara', 'Gamble', 'other', 'writers', 'introduced', 'number', 'interesting', 'characters', 'including', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'grandfather', 'returning', 'did', ""n't"", 'develop', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'pity', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'built', 'couple', 'good', 'episodes', 'hunter', 'family', 'exploring', 'dynamic', 'relationship', 'eliminated', 'couple', 'weaker', 'episodes', 'involving', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'characters', 'had', 'peripheral', 'characters', 'much', 'are', 'episode', 'Weekend', 'Bobby', '.SPOILERS', 'When', 'last', 'saw', 'Sam', 'descended', 'Hell', 'Luicifer', 'personna', 'trapped', 'Dean', 'normal', 'family', 'life', 'finding', 'peace', 'never', 'had', 'when', 'was', 'raised', 'year', 'eternity', 'Sam', 'When', 'Sam', 'mysteriously', 'Dean', 'back', 'hunting', 'Dean', 'Sam', 'changed', 'amoral', 'delight', 'torture', 'others', 'something', 'Sam', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'Dean', 'discovers', 'Sam', 'returned', 'body', 'soul.END', 'SPOILERS', 'Blu-ray', 'positively', 'stunning', 'sharp', 'desaturated', 'presentation', 'true', 'look', 'original', 'broadcast', 'Audio', 'presented', 'HD', '5.1', 'lossless', 'quality.The', 'extras', 'include', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Ben', 'Edlund', 'amusing', 'Clap', 'Your', 'Believe', 'French', 'Mistake', 'Edlund', 'producer', 'Sara', 'Gamble', 'director', 'Robert', 'Singer', 'latter', 'interactive', 'trivia', 'track', 'Blu-ray.We', 'also', 'get', 'featurette', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'turn', 'camera', 'Weekend', 'Bobby', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'Supernatural', 'Animated', 'Series', 'Hell', 'Breaks', 'Loose', 'parts', 'II', 'are', 'also', 'include', 'also', 'get', 'outtakes/alternate', 'French', 'Mistake', '.The', 'Blu-ray', 'also', 'Hunter', 'Guide', 'interactive', 'feature', 'exclusive', 'featurettes', 'production', 'series', 'buried', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Supernatural', 'Quest', 'Soul', 'featurette', 'season', 'six', 'gag', 'reel', 'sixth', 'season.While', 'season', 'six', 'was', 'bit', 'uneven', 'taking', 'awhile', 'find', 'footing', 'once', 'sixth', 'season', 'did', 'discover', 'tone', 'season', 'were', 'number', 'outstanding', 'episodes', 'Part', 'issue', 'was', 'due', 'switch', 'producers', 'main', 'reason', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'originally', 'designed', 'five', 'season', 'series.Recommended']",Supernatural: Season 6
