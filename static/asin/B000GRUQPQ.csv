The main character is a cannonball of humor and humanity - not the typical wussy female heroine you often find in this genre.  She's someone a real female can relate to.Visually, as the anime progresses, it delves deeper into an avant-garde style of presentation.  It becomes less of an animated series and more an experiment in visual storytelling.  I actually appreciated this aspect of the series and looked forward to seeing how the story would be told in each episode. From the popsicle stick figures, cityscapes, flashing images, sketch book drawings, etc. everything was very different and very interesting to watch.The story itself is great - it branches off gracefully from the stories of our two main characters as they progress in high school and develop into adulthood.The reason I can't give this set a full 5 stars however is that the behind the scenes problems led to a number of useless recap fillers and a hanging final episode.  I presume there was the intention of continuing beyond 26 episodes because the final episode does nothing to wrap up any loose ends (although it seems that most shoujo I've watched ends up with a mediocre or unsatisfying ending anyway.)  The bright side is that the manga continues well beyond this final episode and any individual who desperately wants to know how all these fantastic and complex characters will end up is able to read on to a very satisfactory and complete ending.Understanding that this is incomplete, experimental, and yet totally emotionally captivating this set easily earns 4 stars.",4,Not your typical anime,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,1756,"['nothing', 'typical', 'anime', 'so', 'really', 'clear', 'preconceived', 'notions', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'what', 'expect.At', 'first', 'series', 'very', 'similar', 'standard', 'Shoujo', 'anime', 'main', 'character', 'cannonball', 'humor', 'humanity', 'not', 'typical', 'wussy', 'female', 'heroine', 'often', 'find', 'genre', 'someone', 'real', 'female', 'can', 'relate', 'to.Visually', 'anime', 'deeper', 'avant-garde', 'style', 'presentation', 'less', 'animated', 'series', 'more', 'experiment', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'actually', 'appreciated', 'aspect', 'series', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'how', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'told', 'episode', 'popsicle', 'stick', 'figures', 'cityscapes', 'flashing', 'images', 'sketch', 'book', 'drawings', 'etc', 'everything', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'very', 'interesting', 'watch.The', 'story', 'great', 'gracefully', 'stories', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'progress', 'high', 'school', 'develop', 'adulthood.The', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'set', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'however', 'scenes', 'problems', 'led', 'number', 'useless', 'recap', 'fillers', 'hanging', 'final', 'episode', 'presume', 'was', 'intention', 'continuing', '26', 'episodes', 'final', 'episode', 'nothing', 'wrap', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'most', 'shoujo', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'up', 'mediocre', 'unsatisfying', 'ending', 'anyway', 'bright', 'side', 'manga', 'well', 'final', 'episode', 'individual', 'who', 'desperately', 'know', 'how', 'fantastic', 'complex', 'characters', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'able', 'read', 'very', 'satisfactory', 'complete', 'ending.Understanding', 'incomplete', 'experimental', 'yet', 'totally', 'emotionally', 'captivating', 'set', 'easily', '4', 'stars']",His & Her Circumstances: TV Series Collection

1006663,AK019BF9HMELY,B000GRUQPQ,"Jay F. Grissom ""JF""","[3, 4]","This really works for someone who wants to relive their first love!This anime is so satisfying it is hard to put into words. It is warm, loving, full of hope, filled with innocents, and just a fine piece of work.The animation is a little dated by todays standards. It has a ""classic"" anime style to it which is more reminiscent of the days before it became cheaper to farm animation out to Korea.The story is very enjoyable and it will occupy a the greater portion of a week if you don't watch them all in one sitting. (It is good enough that you may want to watch them all at once... but long enough to make that unreasonable...)Buy this... you'll be happy did. I bought it based on someone elses review that said, ""Buy it you'll be happy"" so I agree with them...This is NOT anime for fan service, sexy girls, or anything that a young man might want to pick up. No big robots, no triple ""D"" cup sized sex crazed space pirate women.This is something that someone in love, has been in love, or would like to be in love could relate to. There is a sense of innocents to this work that is fabulous. Its really about being young and falling in love... it is so sweet you might need a dentist when you're done!Also, if you liked Azumanga Daioh (which was GREAT also) you will enjoy this too.Seriously... it is good you won't be unhappy if you pick it up.",5,"Don't miss this!

1006664,A3LIWTQDSQ5UOO,B000GRUQPQ,"Jonathan Oyama ""Welcome to die!""","[5, 7]","Although this series is considered a timeless classic, I can't recommend it too much.  Sadly, because of conflicts between Director Hideaki Anno and the author of the Kare Kano manga, Anno left the production to another director and the production suffered from it.  Because the series was eventually discontinued, there is no ending to this series.In spite of this, Anno's direction turns this series into a great romantic comedy.  The two main characters, Yukino and Arima, are both the top students in their high school.  Yukino wanted to prove she is the best student in the high school, but she has no friends.  Her plans changed after Arima found out that she was really a nerd who acted like a princess.  However, Arima still loved her.  The two love each other, and help each other out through tough times.  They argue against their school counselor to keep their relationship, and they even struggle through sexual tension.The sexual tension part eventually turned me off. The anime doesn't cover all the difficulties of this teenage love at the end, but even main characters make mistakes. I still think anime characters should rely on their intellect rather than their passion, but the sexual intensity reflects the turmoil of their teenage hormones.The art direction also took a 180 degree turn on episode 19, when the flat anime characters were replaced with drawings pasted on cardboard cuttings.  At this time, Director Hideaki Anno left Gainax, and future FLCL director Kazuya Tsurumaki took his place.  The series grew more cartoonish, and fans eventually stopped watching the series.  However, the story never faltered, even at the very end.I don't think this is the best series.  It is incomplete, and I didn't think the characters were realistic or likable enough.  However, I enjoyed Anno's look at the psyche of the characters in their adventures with romance.  I can only give this series a three star rating, because I've seen far better shoujo anime. But Anno's direction job makes for a great, though claustrophobic, look at shoujo romance.",3,His and Her Circumstances - Circumstantially flawed,1186704000,"08 10, 2007",2007,2066,"['series', 'considered', 'timeless', 'classic', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'too', 'much', 'Sadly', 'conflicts', 'Director', 'Hideaki', 'Anno', 'author', 'Kare', 'Kano', 'manga', 'Anno', 'left', 'production', 'director', 'production', 'suffered', 'series', 'was', 'eventually', 'discontinued', 'ending', 'series.In', 'spite', 'Anno', 'direction', 'series', 'great', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Yukino', 'Arima', 'are', 'top', 'students', 'high', 'school', 'Yukino', 'wanted', 'prove', 'best', 'student', 'high', 'school', 'friends', 'plans', 'changed', 'Arima', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'really', 'nerd', 'who', 'acted', 'princess', 'However', 'Arima', 'still', 'loved', 'two', 'love', 'other', 'help', 'other', 'out', 'tough', 'times', 'argue', 'school', 'counselor', 'keep', 'relationship', 'even', 'struggle', 'sexual', 'tension.The', 'sexual', 'tension', 'part', 'eventually', 'turned', 'off', 'anime', ""n't"", 'cover', 'difficulties', 'teenage', 'love', 'end', 'even', 'main', 'characters', 'make', 'mistakes', 'still', 'think', 'anime', 'characters', 'should', 'rely', 'intellect', 'rather', 'passion', 'sexual', 'intensity', 'turmoil', 'teenage', 'hormones.The', 'art', 'direction', 'also', 'took', '180', 'degree', 'turn', 'episode', '19', 'when', 'flat', 'anime', 'characters', 'were', 'replaced', 'drawings', 'pasted', 'cardboard', 'cuttings', 'time', 'Director', 'Hideaki', 'Anno', 'left', 'Gainax', 'future', 'FLCL', 'director', 'Kazuya', 'Tsurumaki', 'took', 'place', 'series', 'grew', 'more', 'cartoonish', 'fans', 'eventually', 'stopped', 'watching', 'series', 'However', 'story', 'never', 'faltered', 'even', 'very', 'end.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'best', 'series', 'incomplete', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'characters', 'were', 'realistic', 'likable', 'enough', 'However', 'enjoyed', 'Anno', 'look', 'psyche', 'characters', 'adventures', 'romance', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'series', 'three', 'star', 'rating', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'far', 'better', 'shoujo', 'anime', 'Anno', 'direction', 'job', 'great', 'claustrophobic', 'look', 'shoujo', 'romance']",His & Her Circumstances: TV Series Collection
