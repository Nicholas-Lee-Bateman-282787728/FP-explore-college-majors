Even though the instructor is pretty friendly and cuing is not a problem, she is constantly off-beat with the awful music. I had to force myself through it and not look at the screen because she was so out of synch. I worked up a sweat because I was using 2-lb hand weights but it was just not motivating to do. The 10-minute toning section consisted of a couple of leg lifts and push ups. I think the best part was the warm-up, but it was longer and slower than I'm used to.

I am an intermediate exerciser who likes to work up a sweat without the steps being too complex. I do this video on risers. It is 30 min of pure basic step so if you're into complex choreography, then you'll be bored. Some say it is repetitive, but I like doing the move enough times to know what I am doing and to benefit from it! I am not at the point where I want fancy footwork. The stretch at the begining and end were good and it was set to classical music which I thought was nice! The class seemed like a real class of exercisors. I recomend it to you if you want a good heart pumping workout without complicated moves! The negatives of this DVD is the production quality such as some blurry spots and the music is rather faint.

864005,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B00068WRNO,Little Miss Cutey,"[17, 19]","I love step aerobics and I own many dvds and vhs workouts.  Kathy is normally a good instructer but what I really noticed in this DVD (and it made me realize that I've noticed this in past ones), was that she is often out of time to the music.  This may not upset many people, but if you are using the music to help you stay motivated and moving, it's going to trip you up a bit.  It's frustrating to see the class doing one thing and her doing another, because they've stayed in time and she's strayed a little.  At the push-up section, all the class is moving at different speeds and it's totally off-putting.  Sometimes, the music was simply way too fast for anyone to be doing step aerobics to.  It's a good workout and you will definately get a sweat going, but try to put the timing out of your head if you can.The other thing that I found to be a little annoying, was that the routines weren't structured.  Most instructors give you little routines and then build those up to one big routine.  Kathy in this DVD however, is all hickilty pickitly.  It's almost like she's making up the routine as she's going along.  There was hardly any building of a good flowing pattern.  Nothing flowed well and this makes this workout seem a little unmotivating because of the sudden and bizare changes.  She will cue you in well, (she is a good instructor), but it's not an exciting workout.  Go for Kari Anderson or Christie Taylor.  They are two of the best instructors out there.",3,Good but not great,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,1477,"['love', 'step', 'aerobics', 'own', 'many', 'dvds', 'vhs', 'workouts', 'Kathy', 'normally', 'good', 'instructer', 'what', 'really', 'noticed', 'DVD', 'made', 'realize', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'past', 'ones', 'was', 'often', 'time', 'music', 'may', 'not', 'upset', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'using', 'music', 'help', 'stay', 'motivated', 'moving', 'going', 'trip', 'up', 'bit', 'frustrating', 'see', 'class', 'doing', 'one', 'thing', 'doing', ""'ve"", 'stayed', 'time', 'strayed', 'little', 'push-up', 'section', 'class', 'moving', 'different', 'speeds', 'totally', 'off-putting', 'Sometimes', 'music', 'was', 'simply', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'anyone', 'be', 'doing', 'step', 'aerobics', 'good', 'workout', 'will', 'definately', 'get', 'sweat', 'going', 'try', 'put', 'timing', 'head', 'can.The', 'other', 'thing', 'found', 'be', 'little', 'annoying', 'was', 'routines', 'were', ""n't"", 'structured', 'Most', 'instructors', 'give', 'little', 'routines', 'then', 'build', 'one', 'big', 'routine', 'Kathy', 'DVD', 'however', 'hickilty', 'pickitly', 'almost', 'making', 'up', 'routine', 'going', 'along', 'was', 'hardly', 'building', 'good', 'flowing', 'pattern', 'Nothing', 'flowed', 'well', 'workout', 'seem', 'little', 'unmotivating', 'sudden', 'bizare', 'changes', 'will', 'cue', 'well', 'good', 'instructor', 'not', 'exciting', 'workout', 'Go', 'Kari', 'Anderson', 'Christie', 'Taylor', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'instructors', 'out', 'there']",N/A

It's true that the moves are basic but Kathy's direction are very clear and she gives tips throughout.The biggest appeal to me is that this DVD works well not only for ""recycled beginners"" like myself but for:*someone that's fairly new to working out,*just that's decided to get off the couch,*even if you're a more seasoned fitness fan getting over an illness, injury, or a case of the ""blahs""It's just the thing to help you ease back into your workout routine and one can increase the intensity if they're creative.Another important thing is that in the beginning of the workout Kathy says you can do this workout without a step which is great for those on tight budgets or just trying to work their way up to using a step.After I got used to doing her routine on the floor, I used an old foam mat about the size of a step to get use to more focused movements then when my budget allowed, I bought a step.I started by using the top platform only and then worked my way up.Most important to me is that I consider this DVD to be ""knee friendly"".  I know this because I have to be mindful of some movements due to my past knee issues. This workout is ""do-able and I learned how to modify moves as needed.  The DVD is also chaperted so you have even more control over how you want to approach this workout.It is because of this and all the reasons listed above that I am buying yet another copy for my job since we're currently looking into setting up a Fitness room and this would be perfect for our future workout library.

864008,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00068WRNO,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[5, 6]","Kathy Kaehler takes you from Ballet and Pilates to Aerobics and then completes the workout with a relaxing stretching routine. Her unique and somewhat elegant approach at the start allows you to relax, therefore causing less stress during the step segment, where you can use a step, or simply follow along without one.You can still workout comfortably and enjoy the exercises, perhaps even adding in some of your own moves or adding in walking here and there, where the exercises become less effective without the proper equipment.Throughout this vigorous routine, you will stretch, breathe deeply during the stretching routines and find yourself rather relaxed within 50 minutes. There are no weights needed, but a step is definitely recommended. A short routine on the floor and ballet stretches at the start make this an elegant and relaxing workout. The music is especially good as it moves from calming to energizing and then you return to total relaxation.

For me, however, during those moments, I just close my eyes and go at the ""right"" pace!  Other than that it is a great workout that combines stretching, yoga, intensity and cool downs.  I usually combine this workout with my other yoga DVD and it's a great workout that I actually look forward to.

I checked this DVD out of the library and the first time I played it I couldn't stand Kathy's style or the workout.  The next day I returned the DVD to the library.  Because of the limited step aerobic offerings at the library I ended up checking it out again a few weeks later and something clicked.  Now I'm a major fan of Kathy's and I love this workout (although the ballet mini-warmup may never win me over).  It was this video that coached me through a breakthrough with step aerobic lunges.  I had the hardest time mastering them until this workout.  Kathy takes them a little slower and I finally developed a technique that has vastly benefited me, my heart and my thighs.
