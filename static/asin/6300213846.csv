First of all, I love Michelle Pfeiffer, she can make any terrible movie wonderful. Her singing is ok, but it's not the best voice I have ever heard. Her little boy toy kinda resembles James Dean, his voice his pretty darn good but geez what a horrific storyline! Why did they make a Grease 2 anyway? They must have known this film wouldn't be a huge blockbuster like the first? Stay far away from this stupid sequel, I guess you can call this a guilty pleasure but I didn't find much pleasure here.",1,Grease ain't the word this time around.,1154476800,"08 2, 2006",2006,579,"['Grease', '2', 'so', 'tedious', 'ridculous', 'unnecessary', 'so', 'funny', 'watch', 'First', 'love', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'can', 'make', 'terrible', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'singing', 'ok', 'not', 'best', 'voice', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'little', 'boy', 'toy', 'kinda', 'James', 'Dean', 'voice', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'what', 'horrific', 'storyline', 'Why', 'did', 'make', 'Grease', '2', 'anyway', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'huge', 'blockbuster', 'first', 'Stay', 'far', 'away', 'stupid', 'sequel', 'guess', 'can', 'call', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'much', 'pleasure', 'here']",N/A

There's an entirely new senior class,set in 1961,two years after the original Grease gang graduated from Rydell High School. That means this class were sophomores during the original Grease era,unseen of course. This was Michelle Pfeiffer's first starring film. She appears opposite Maxwell Caufield,a foreign exchange student from Australia who becomes a T-Bird. Pfeiffer,is a Pink Lady of course. Those who returned for the sequel are Didi Conn as Frenchy who had dropped out and come back to repeat the 12th grade. Eve Arden as Rydell High's principal and Sid Caesar as the phys. ed. instructor. One memorable scene is the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies at a bowling alley singing,&quot;We're gonna score tonight!&quot;(sorry,I don't know the song title). Pfeiffer contributes her singing vocals to the soundtrack album on COOL RIDER. Another reason why this film flopped:it didn't even feature a reprise of GREASE,the theme song from the first film,performed by Frankie Valli and written by ex-Bee Gee Barry Gibb. The soundtrack was enitirely original. Imagine John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John,the stars of the first film,paying a visit to Rydell High in this film. This film could have gotten mixed reviews by the critics if that had happened.

Sure, once in a while you hit the jackpot, but mostly, lame original programming and a repetitive nature that can drive any sane person into psychosis. Of course, I didn't mind when the HBO started showing ""Anchorman"" every 2 hours each and every day of the week. That was heaven. But those golden moments of bliss are few and far between.It appears this month's selection for overexposure is ""Grease 2"". It's on 3 or 4 times a day. I can basically switch over to one of the 10 HBO channels at any given time of the day and it will be on.I had not attempted to sit down and watch ""Grease 2"" for about 20 years. I hadn't forgotten it. I watched it alot when I was a wee child and even had the soundtrack on 8-track for a spell. However, over the years I was brainwashed by the crackpot movie critics and the genuine haters into believing that this film was a lack-luster cash-in on the success of the original ""Grease"".So one afternoon I saw it was on the HBO and gave it another chance. All those fond memories came rushing back to me. I remembered all the songs, especially ""Who's That Guy"" and ""Reproduction"". Sure, it was kinda dumb, but so was the original, and sometimes dumb equals fun, and in this case, it does. I was thoroughly entertained. In fact, I was so entertained, that an hour after the film was over I switched over to another HBO where the film was starting again. That's right, I watched it a second time. Then, at 10 pm, yet another airing of this wonderful little creature, and once again I watched it all the way through. That's right. Three times in one day. Needless to say, I was hooked.I went right out and snagged a copy of the soundtrack, which I have been listening to non-stop. It's only a matter of time before ""Grease 2"" is sitting on my DVD shelf as well. I've watched the film 2 more times on HBO this week, and I can't get the songs out of my head.This is a good, fun movie, and the people here who dismiss it are doing so only because they are so caught up in ""Grease 1"" that they fail to let ""Grease 2"" stand on it's own. It's a different film, more like ""Rocky Horror"" than ""Grease"", but in my mind it is just as good, and the songs are every bit as good as the original. ""Cool Rider"", ""Turn Back the Hands of Time"", ""Who's That Guy"", ""Reproduction"" and ""Charades"" are all great cuts.You have to come down from your high horse, people, and give it a chance. It is pure entertainment. Don't be a stick in the mud. Don't be a hater. Get over yourselves.

209340,AGOTQ7VEQ5IML,6300213846,"cdkscully ""cdkscully""","[17, 19]","The sequel to Grease and closely modeled after it, Grease 2 takes place in 1961 during the John F. Kennedy administration at Rydell High School.  Some of the same faculty members are still there such as Miss McGee (Eve Arden), Blanche (Dody Goodman) and Coach Calhoun (Sid Caesar) along with some new faculty members such as Miss Mason (Connie Stevens), Mr. Stuart (Tab Hunter) and Mr. Spears (Dick Patterson).  The main difference between Grease and Grease 2 is the students.  Since the original Pink Ladies and T-Birds graduated in the last picture, Grease 2 contains an all new cast of students except for one, Frenchy (Didi Conn), who failed her senior year.  The main plot in this musical is that a new student Michael (Maxwell Caulfield) falls in love with Pink Lady Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer).  She is off-limits until he can prove himself as a leather-clad biker.  Michael then buys a motorcycle, a helmet and becomes a mysterious stranger, appearing to Stephanie at different places such as the gas station where she works.  In the end, he sweeps her off her feet.Grease 2 was considered to be a typical sequel that would do terrible at the box office and not live up to the name it was carrying.  It starred two actors, Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield, who were unknowns in 1982 playing sexual reversal roles from the original.  Pfeiffer played the Travolta role and Caulfield played the English version of the Newton-John role.  This was the first criticism of the movie from reviews and the general public when it was released.  With a sequel, the audience feels more comfortable watching the same characters from the first movie in the second one.  Another problem or dislike of the film is that it runs out of story.  The main point of the story is how Michael delays revealing himself to Stephanie until the climax of the movie.  The filmmakers didn't give Caulfield enough to do, like dancing, which is one of the most important aspects of the Grease movies.""But what undoubtedly counts are the musical numbers.  Tunes were penned by various hands and most of them are well conceived and reasonably clever."" (Variety, T. McCarthy, June 9, 1982).  The songs are what gives the movie its energy and try to highlight the points of the film when the storyline was drifting.  There is a raising ensemble number called ""Back to School to start the movie off with a bang, a enlivened bowling alley number called ""Score Tonight"" and a dirty-minded number called ""Reproduction"" that turns a biology lesson into an outbreak about adolescent desire.  Director and choreographer, Patricia Birch, found the most interesting places to stage the musical numbers such as a bomb shelter (""Let's Do it For Our Country"") and a bowling alley (""Score Tonight"") and uses some sharp, rapid, short sequences that gives liveliness to most of the dances.Despite all the bad reviews, I found this musical as enjoyable as Grease.  The film's original goal was to appeal to the pre-teens and teenagers, not to the adults.  The storyline was simpler and lighter than Grease and the songs were more upbeat and creative.  I was not discouraged from seeing this film because Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta were not in it.

I remember thinking at the time ""boy! this is the greatest movie ever!""  I was so used to the original that I mistook the characters of Johnny(Adrien Zmed, then star of TJ Hooker) & Stephanie(then unknown-turned household name mega moviestar Michelle Pfeiffer) as Danny Zucko & Sandy Olsen.  It took me awhile to figure out that these were new goups of T-Birds & Pink Ladies & exchange student Michael(Maxwell Caulfield) would become Stephanie's boyfriend (after becoming a ""cool rider"").Despite poor ratings & nothing based on a Broadway musical w/same characters & story (to best of my knowledge) this is still fun to watch & I recommend for anyone who loves the '50's & '60's & music that makes you want to get up & dance.  The clothes & hairdos are excellent & kind of show how the looks were similar almost at the time the movie was released (new wave, 50's-'60's clean looks, no more tackiness laid-back '70's styles).Similar to both stage & screen of first ""Grease,"" we have twentysomethings, some pushing 30 at the time, playing high school minors & they appear a little too mature & adult looking.  Only exception were Pamela Segall(Delores) & Leif Green(Davey). Ms. Segall was about 14 when the movie was made & young Mr. Green also looks about 17-19.  (I once confused him w/'70's teenybopper Leif Garrett but realized they are two different actors)The musical #'s are great & catchy.  The choreography is also great & it's amazing how talented the T-Birds & Pink Ladies are.  Leif Green makes for a good clumsy, naive, scared-to-fight T-Bird whose bowling ball is too heavy but very flexible if you notice he can do the splits when he jumps up in the ""Score Tonight"" #.  ""Score Tonight"" would probably be my favorite musical # & what I reccommend as a sneak peek for those who have never seen this movie.  ""Cool Rider"" & ""Who's that Guy?"" sound very then-the-style new wave.Chris McDonald(Goose) is so young looking & almost unrecognizable then.  Unfortunately he didnt age very well in appearances in past 15 yrs & seems to be typecast as a nerdy guy in ""Flubber"" & ""Leave it to Beaver.""I wish there were more scenes w/Pamela Segall as she is credited as being one of the Pink Ladies.  I just read on imdb.com that at the time she was involved in an auto accident & stand-in was used for some scenes.  This may also expl why she's not seen w/the other 4 Pink Ladies for most of the movie.  She makes a good tough talking HS freshman Pink Lady. In spite of the accident, it's good to pair her character up w/Davey & more scenes should'v showed them together.",2,"fun, catchy songs, early 60's & '80s nostalgia, cult classic........unfortunately box office flop",1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,2695,"['remember', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'when', 'was', '6th', 'grade', '4', '5', 'months', 'release', 'date', 'dollar', 'theatre', 'remember', 'thinking', 'time', 'boy', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'was', 'so', 'used', 'original', 'mistook', 'characters', 'Johnny', 'Adrien', 'Zmed', 'then', 'star', 'TJ', 'Hooker', 'Stephanie', 'then', 'unknown-turned', 'household', 'name', 'mega', 'moviestar', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Danny', 'Zucko', 'Sandy', 'Olsen', 'took', 'awhile', 'figure', 'out', 'were', 'new', 'goups', 'T-Birds', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'exchange', 'student', 'Michael', 'Maxwell', 'Caulfield', 'would', 'become', 'Stephanie', 'boyfriend', 'becoming', 'cool', 'rider', '.Despite', 'poor', 'ratings', 'nothing', 'based', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'w/same', 'characters', 'story', 'best', 'knowledge', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', ""'50"", ""'60"", 'music', 'want', 'get', 'up', 'dance', 'clothes', 'hairdos', 'are', 'excellent', 'kind', 'show', 'how', 'looks', 'were', 'similar', 'almost', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'new', 'wave', ""50's-'60"", 'clean', 'looks', 'more', 'tackiness', 'laid-back', ""'70"", 'styles', '.Similar', 'stage', 'screen', 'first', 'Grease', 'have', 'twentysomethings', 'pushing', '30', 'time', 'playing', 'high', 'school', 'minors', 'appear', 'little', 'too', 'mature', 'adult', 'looking', 'Only', 'exception', 'were', 'Pamela', 'Segall', 'Delores', 'Leif', 'Green', 'Davey', 'Ms.', 'Segall', 'was', 'about', '14', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'young', 'Mr.', 'Green', 'also', '17-19', 'once', 'confused', ""w/'70"", 'teenybopper', 'Leif', 'Garrett', 'realized', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'actors', 'musical', 'are', 'great', 'catchy', 'choreography', 'also', 'great', 'amazing', 'how', 'talented', 'T-Birds', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'are', 'Leif', 'Green', 'good', 'clumsy', 'naive', 'scared-to-fight', 'T-Bird', 'bowling', 'ball', 'too', 'heavy', 'very', 'flexible', 'notice', 'can', 'do', 'splits', 'when', 'up', 'Score', 'Tonight', 'Score', 'Tonight', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'favorite', 'musical', 'what', 'reccommend', 'sneak', 'peek', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'Cool', 'Rider', 'Who', 'Guy', 'sound', 'very', 'then-the-style', 'new', 'wave.Chris', 'McDonald', 'Goose', 'so', 'young', 'looking', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'then', 'Unfortunately', 'age', 'very', 'well', 'appearances', 'past', '15', 'yrs', 'be', 'typecast', 'nerdy', 'guy', 'Flubber', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'scenes', 'w/Pamela', 'Segall', 'credited', 'being', 'one', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'just', 'read', 'imdb.com', 'time', 'was', 'involved', 'auto', 'accident', 'stand-in', 'was', 'used', 'scenes', 'may', 'also', 'expl', 'why', 'not', 'seen', 'other', '4', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'most', 'movie', 'good', 'tough', 'talking', 'HS', 'freshman', 'Pink', 'Lady', 'spite', 'accident', 'good', 'pair', 'character', 'up', 'w/Davey', 'more', 'scenes', 'should', 'v', 'showed', 'together']",N/A

209345,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6300213846,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[10, 14]","I love Grease (as a little kid, Olivia Newton-John was the first to show me there's more - a whole lot more - to girls than cooties), and I was quite prepared to go the rest of my life without seeing Grease 2, a movie I've never heard a good thing about.  Then a friend tells me I need to watch it, that she loves Grease 2, and I see it has Lorna Luft in it (whose mother - Judy Garland - I adore), and so I watch it.  For the love of everything ever considered cool, how did this happen?  How can you take one of the coolest movies ever made and turn around five years later and release what has to be the worst sequel in motion picture history?  Apparently, it took five years of hard work to take everything Grease did so right and figure out a way to do it all so wrong.  The story, the music, the acting - in a word, dreadful; no, make that two words - embarrassingly dreadful.  Grease 2 is even worse than Xanadu.People say you shouldn't compare this to Grease; you've got to judge Grease 2 on its own merits (it stinks whichever way you look at it, by the way).  How can you not compare this to Grease?  If they didn't want me to compare this to Grease, they wouldn't have called it Grease 2, they wouldn't have taken me back to Rydell High, they wouldn't have resurrected characters like Principal McGee, Coach Calhoun, and Frenchie, they wouldn't have passed off this new kid from England as Sandy's cousin, and they surely wouldn't have thrown me back amongst the Pink Ladies and the T-Birds.  Speaking of the T-Birds, it hurts to see how far they fell in a mere two years (the movie is set in 1961, two years after Grease).  Johnny (Adrian Zmed) and Goose (Christopher McDonald) are made in the image of Danny and Kenickie, but they just don't measure up.  These new T-Birds turn tail and run whenever Crater-face and his gang of greasers come roaring up.Everything is reversed in this movie, especially the central plot.  Here you have a new, goody-goody male student having to transform himself into something ""bad"" in order to win over the less than sophisticated girl.  Maxwell Caulfield isn't all that bad as Michael Carrington, but the guy's got as much charisma as a toasted cheese sandwich.  Stephanie (Michelle Pfeiffer) won't give him the time of day - even if she did, the Pink Lady code wouldn't let her date him.  And so it is that Michael decides to transform himself into T-Bird material.  Once he has a motorcycle and learns how to ride it, he runs circles around the greasers and wins Stephanie's heart - but only as Mr. Excitement in goggles, not as himself.  What will happen when she finds out her danger man is Michael?I won't even get into the whole subject of the big talent show, except to question why kids who see themselves as cool not only make fools of themselves willingly, but begin practicing some eight months before the actual show.  I will get into the subject of the music, though.  I don't know what this music is; it isn't 50's music, and it isn't 60's music.  It's horrible, and all the dance numbers that go along with it are even more horrible.Count me among the untold number of Grease fans who refuse to recognize Grease 2 as a sequel.

The thing I loved about the original was how it captured the late 50's with music, custumes, and attitudes and yet this sequel seemed to fall flat on it's face in all those categories. The songs are so out of place with lots of 80's ish themes being played during certain scenes. The producer couldn't even focus on one time period with the music which ranged from 50's, 60's, 70's and even 80's metal at one point. The mood and feel of the movie was wrecked by this alone, without including the fact that the songs themselves were utterly boring. One or two songs were ok, like ""Reproduction"" and the biker song by Michelle Pfeiffer.If you buy this thinking it's a real sequel to Grease you are sadly mistaken. There's not alot in common at all with the first movie other then a few characters and the ""T-birds"" and ""Pink Ladies"". The plot is totally cheesy also. I'm not sure what I hated worst, the fact that some of the hairstyles and music reminded me more of the 80's or the predictable plot of the movie. ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" , ""The Breakfast Club"" & ""Sixteen Candles"" are so much better movies at representing the 80's if you are looking for a movie like that. The last thing I wish to see is a movie suposedly set in 1961 is for it to coming off in all respects to be 1982.When I watch movies like this, I like to be transported back to a place in time and feel the period completely.

First of all, the songs are much catchier! ""Cool Rider"" is so awesome and 10 times better than any song you can find on the original Grease soundtrack. The chemistry between Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Phieffer is awesome. Stephanie Zanoni is the COOLEST pink lady ever!

209351,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,6300213846,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[4, 5]","Judging by the cover art, one of these actors will have a movie career after this.""Grease 2"" suffered from the same '80s sequel condition that ""Caddyshack 2"", ""Short Circuit 2"", or any non-Spielberg-related sequel had.  The symptoms for this condition include not having all of the main cast from the first film (sans a few), not having the same charm and magic as the first, not having any memorable moments, and nothing significant to even merit a sequel.  This movie did have Frenchy from the first movie, who goes back to high school to get into chemistry, but she only appeared in three scenes for exposition's sake, and after that she just vanished and everyone seem to forgot about her.  I guess the actress got the paycheck and want nothing else to do with the sequel.The story of ""Grease 2"" is essentially the same thing as ""Grease 1"", only gender-swapped.  The foreign exchange student is a handsome nerd, and the attractive sexual-opposite is part of a feminine group that is deeply connected with the rebel biker-boys of the school.  The only way for the nerd to get her attention is to be a cool biker-boy himself.  I never felt a deep combination from Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield because the way they initated their relationship was forced; the guy just looked at her and find her to be the one, and she kissed him from out of nowhere (granted, that was to upset the biker-boys, but she could've chose a less promiscuous option).  The relationship between Olivia and John's character in ""Grease"" was believable since they used to have an affair before school started, so the main couple in this film was tacky.  Plus, in the end, Pfeiffer's character didn't really appreciated Caulfield's character for himself, she just liked him for him becoming a badboy; that's not exactly a compelling message.The first movie had some timeless musical classics as 'Summer Nights', 'Grease Lightning' and 'You're The One That I want'.  What songs did ""Grease 2"" warm people's hearts?  'We're Gonna Score Tonight', 'Let's Do It for Our Country', and 'Reproduction'.  I don't mind innuendo in my songs, but the songs themselves were not interesting.  At least in ""Xanadu"", despite my eyes being abused by the sight of flashing lights and gaudy costumes, I was both blinded and pleased with some catchy tunes.  Here, they don't really caught my ear, and the musical numbers were lousy at worst; a couple of them have a few instances of off-screen singing while the people are dancing, and a few others have people spoke but not in tune to the music; it worked for the 'he's sounds like a drag' line in Grease, but not here.""Grease 2"" is an underwhelming sequel through and through.

209355,A15TNUM2PBS6F0,6300213846,"Ei ""crzybookmoovielover""","[0, 0]","How many of us will actually admit that we enjoyed this movie? Hence, that is why it is a guilty pleasure of mine.Of course, 20 years ago, when I first saw it, I wouldn't have agreed with my previous statement here.For a sequel, it isn't bad, but it isn't good either. It's so bad it is good.  This is classic 80's cheese at it's finest 1 and 1/2 hours.What is really amazing about this film is that Michelle Pfeiffer is the star.  She plays Stephanie Zinoni, the new leader of the Pink Ladies.  Yes, the pink ladies are in this one, too. Not only can Pfeiffer look down right unhappy to be in this film, but she can sing! and dance!  sort of...The highlight for her singing is with &quot;Cool Rider&quot;, a tune in which she declares what it is she really wants in a guy to Michael.She isn't a bad crooner, she even crooned in a much better movie &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot;.  Watching this on t.v.(the watered down, edited version), the other day, and now being older and wiser than I was the first 20 times, I think that Pfeiffer really didn't want to do this film.  Perhaps she was embarrassed and still is by it. She doesn't look like she is enjoying being in a musical comedy.  Her acting isn't bad, but it is strained.  Maybe that is how the character should be played, but like John Travolta in &quot;Grease&quot;, she just looks bored and uninterested.As far as the movie goes, I can't believe I was so obsessed with this at one time.  I know it was only because it had the name &quot;Grease&quot; attached to it.That is the only similarity it has with the original.  That and some of the same actors have come back.  Didi Conn, Sid Ceasar, Eve Arden, and Doodie Goodman are all here.  Frenchie, is showing Sandy's English cousin, Michael Carrington, played quite lamely by Maxwell Caulfield, the &quot;ropes&quot;.  Michael falls for Stephanie. Stephanie has just dumped the leader of the t-birds, Johnny Nogerelli.  Johnny is played by Adrian Zmed. He hasn't become an Academy award nominated actor like Pfeiffer, but he is a decent enough actor who seems to fit more into this and looks more comfortable than Michelle.Michael does everything he can in his power to become the &quot;cool rider&quot; that Stephanie is looking for.  The really unrealistic part is how she meets up with him once he becomes Mr. Cool Rider, and she doesn't even know who he really is. But we wouldn't have much of a movie if she did know, right?Also, the ending of the first movie is so much better.  Here, we have a luai with corny tunes. Much much cornier than &quot;We got Together&quot;.  Instead, we get &quot;We'll be together&quot; as the last song.Even though I know this is hardly a great movie musical, it seems to still keep me entertained today.  The soundtrack has some really fun songs, and once again, I find myself just having fun watching and singing along.Watch it for pure mindless fun.",3,Guilty Pleasure,1018828800,"04 15, 2002",2002,2905,"['How', 'many', 'will', 'actually', 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Hence', 'why', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'mine.Of', 'course', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'agreed', 'previous', 'statement', 'here.For', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'bad', ""n't"", 'good', 'either', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'classic', '80', 'cheese', 'finest', '1', '1/2', 'hours.What', 'really', 'amazing', 'film', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'star', 'Stephanie', 'Zinoni', 'new', 'leader', 'Pink', 'Ladies', 'Yes', 'pink', 'ladies', 'are', 'one', 'too', 'Not', 'only', 'can', 'Pfeiffer', 'look', 'down', 'right', 'unhappy', 'be', 'film', 'can', 'sing', 'dance', 'sort', 'highlight', 'singing', 'quot', 'Cool', 'Rider', 'quot', 'tune', 'what', 'really', 'guy', 'Michael.She', ""n't"", 'bad', 'crooner', 'even', 'crooned', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'quot', 'Fabulous', 'Baker', 'Boys', 'quot', 'Watching', 't.v', 'watered', 'down', 'edited', 'version', 'other', 'day', 'now', 'being', 'older', 'wiser', 'was', 'first', '20', 'times', 'think', 'Pfeiffer', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'embarrassed', 'still', ""n't"", 'look', 'enjoying', 'being', 'musical', 'comedy', 'acting', ""n't"", 'bad', 'strained', 'Maybe', 'how', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'played', 'John', 'Travolta', 'quot', 'Grease', 'quot', 'just', 'bored', 'uninterested.As', 'far', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'was', 'so', 'obsessed', 'one', 'time', 'know', 'was', 'only', 'had', 'name', 'quot', 'Grease', 'quot', 'attached', 'it.That', 'only', 'similarity', 'original', 'same', 'actors', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'Didi', 'Conn', 'Sid', 'Ceasar', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'Doodie', 'Goodman', 'are', 'here', 'Frenchie', 'showing', 'Sandy', 'English', 'cousin', 'Michael', 'Carrington', 'played', 'quite', 'lamely', 'Maxwell', 'Caulfield', 'quot', 'quot', 'Michael', 'Stephanie', 'Stephanie', 'just', 'dumped', 'leader', 't-birds', 'Johnny', 'Nogerelli', 'Johnny', 'played', 'Adrian', 'Zmed', ""n't"", 'become', 'Academy', 'award', 'nominated', 'actor', 'Pfeiffer', 'decent', 'enough', 'actor', 'who', 'fit', 'more', 'more', 'comfortable', 'Michelle.Michael', 'everything', 'can', 'power', 'become', 'quot', 'cool', 'rider', 'quot', 'Stephanie', 'looking', 'really', 'unrealistic', 'part', 'how', 'up', 'once', 'Mr', 'Cool', 'Rider', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'who', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'movie', 'did', 'know', 'right', 'Also', 'ending', 'first', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Here', 'have', 'luai', 'corny', 'tunes', 'Much', 'much', 'cornier', 'quot', 'got', 'Together', 'quot', 'Instead', 'get', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'be', 'together', 'quot', 'last', 'song.Even', 'know', 'hardly', 'great', 'movie', 'musical', 'still', 'keep', 'entertained', 'today', 'soundtrack', 'really', 'fun', 'songs', 'once', 'again', 'find', 'just', 'having', 'fun', 'watching', 'singing', 'along.Watch', 'pure', 'mindless', 'fun']",N/A

In some other reviews I think Batricia Birch should have just stayed with the songs and the numbers. I think they should have got another director to get the rest of the movie off the ground. It is somewhat of a good story. I can see why it would be reversed (a guy trying to get the girl, instead of the other way around). You see Eugine in the beginning of the movie stumbling out of the bus. Well if he were a senior in the first one then why is he in the second one???? Also Frenchie is not with the Pink Ladies at all. You see her by herself or just briefly with the other pink ladies in school. I think the chemistry between Stephanie and Michael were worked well together. The songs were written by the same people that wrote the songs for the first movie. So really the bottom line is that they should have gotten a different director altogether. I know I know it is not the first one. But sequels are usually not, but they usually have connections to the first. Grease 2 tried to accomplish with Frenchie and the Tbirds, Pink ladies and all. I am glad they were able to have Eve Arden, Sid Ceaser, plus other great actors of the 50s and 60s like Tab Hunter. Is this movie cheesy???? YesIs it done in less than expected direction???? Yes. Does it have good songs??  Yes (Cool Rider, Reproduction, We'll Always be Together, Girl for all Seasons/Turn Back, and Back to School). The song skits themselves are good and with the same flavor of the first one. After all Kiddies, Patricia Birch did do the choreography for both.So, in closing, this movie made it to my DVD collection if for that reason alone. If Grease 2 is going to stink then let it reek. If it has its moments of good cute fun then let it have that.

Whereas 1978's Grease was fun and energetic, the word that springs to mind in association with Grease 2 is ""forced"".  The director has tried to fit too much colour, too many plot elements, and too many (largely unfunny) humorous interludes into 115 minutes of film.  These teenagers aren't just a little bit naughty and likeably rude, rather they are all-out hussies and juvenile delinquents.The plot is a carbon copy of the original film.  A foreign student enrolls at Rydell High, immediately develops a crush on the leader of the school's socially elite clique, and spends the rest of the movie trying to make themselves cool enough to be dateable material.  One of the movie's few successes is the casting of Michelle Pfeiffer as the head of the Pink Ladies.  She is both real and charismatic.  Unfortunately the same can't be said of her opposite, Michael (Maxwell Caulfield), who never really gets into the feel of the film.  Additionally, his voice is too light for his character, and at times he appears to have difficulty holding a tune.Song-wise the best of the bunch are the first and last tracks (Back To School Again and We'll Be Together).  They are catchy and snappily choreographed chorus numbers, worthy of inclusion in the Grease franchise.  The rest of the soundtrack wavers between mediocre, appallingly sentimental and plain ridiculous.  Whoever decided that a neat scenario for a song would be to have a biology class singing about the pollination of plants (with the mandatory sexual undertones of course) should have been fired on the spot.

But the movie is fun, even though the songs pretty much stink. The songs in the original, every one, turned out to be an unforgettable classic. In G2 they are all very forgettable. Michael Carrington, the Aussie cousin of Sandy's is the best thing in the movie, and he and a very young Michelle Pffeifer pretty much salvage the movie. The theme this time is motorcycles instead of hot rods, and that is a good twist, as is the &quot;Cool rider&quot; gimmick, but not enough. The T-Birds actually are very uncool in this movie, as they spend the entire flick trying really hard to act cool, and look like idiots in every single scene. John Travolta, in his first &quot;T-Bird&quot; scene in Grease, is just hanging out talking to some girls, and he oozes coolness with just a glance. The character Johnny spends the entire Grease 2 movie trying to be tough and cool, and runs and hides behind the Pink Ladies when Crator-face calls him out.?

In Grease, the 2 main characters (John Travolta and Olivia Newton John) could actually sing. In Grease 2, the main characters (Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer) can sing, but not very good. A couple of the songs are ones that will play over and over in your mind, some of the songs would have been better off to have not been sung at all. The actress that played Sharon (one of the other Pink Ladies) has a voice that hurts to listen to. She is so out of key it is almost like watching the try outs for American Idol.Parts of the movie are down right dumb while the rest is enjoyable/funny.

Yeah, let's do if for our country, our country wants us too.Those are the most of the lyrics I know for that song I don't know the other lyrics too any of the other songs.

So if I'm the only Grease 2 fan please don't blame me if you look at it in a different way you might I said might. Just see what I mean, see when I am totally upset I can go upstairs and pop this in and all the sudden I'm dancing and singing. I think Peter Frachette (Louis) is sooooooooo sexxxxy, also the other T-Birds. The story is simple: Michael new transfer student Sandy's cousin, falls in love with Stephanie head of the new crop of Pink Ladies. Still, if he wants too win her over he has too throw in his school clothes and get into leather quick before Johnny wins her back! The songs are dymaic , the cast is terrific , and the plot is perfectly thick. I wish just some people would look at this movie and really get into the charatcers emotions and feelings. If you disagree so be it still you are on the wrong track too figuring out the way of life! I am in the process (I'm only 12) of writing a sequel where Sharon (Louis's girlfriend) marries Louis after they meet up in collage. Then a month later Sharon find out she has is having baby this is a great comedy-musical. Just like the Grease 2 is I am the only fan if that is the way it will be from now then let it be that way.

For example, so many people hated ""Halloween 5 : The Revenge of Michale Myers"" because it wasn't like the original, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good for a regular film! Hence, ""Grease 2"" was slapped with the lanel of a-bad-movie-sequel-to-a-classic. For me, ""Grease"" was a pretty horrible film. It had hardly a plot and musical numbers that were pretty run of the mill. Why did it succeed? Because it was a play before a film, so everyone who saw it on broadway went to the film; I quess people didn't realize that plays don't exactly transfer well to films. And then when ""Grease 2"" came out, everyone saw a film that was at a little bit higher level than the original, but since it was a ""sequel"", no one went to see it and the reviews bashed it. For me personally, this was a pretty half-way decent film. Sure, the plot was the same as the original but they brought back most of the original supporting cast and didn't try to to have another ""Sandy and Danny"" but have two new characters who had more feelings than just a replica of two kids a couple years ago. And when most people say that they thought they should have tried having another Sandy/Danny relationship, well then they would have been upset because, apparently, you can NEVER have another Sandy/Danny relationship! OH COME ON! The film wasn't that great! Besides, i feel that these songs are much more memorable than the ones from the original; I would find myself humming along to ""Cool Rider"" ,""Reproduction"", or ""Girl for All Seasons"" long before I would get ""Sandra-Dee"" stuck in my head! That's another thing! Everyone says how horrible the songs are in this one but really they are meant to be! They are not meant to be taken seriously! I mean, come on, do you really think the song writer was thinking that ""Reproduction"" was gonna be a thoughtful musical number? No! And to tell you the truth, when people say the songs were bad, look at ""We Go Together"" with all the shoo-bobs, sha-wadda-wadda's and such; was that any better than ""Lets DO IT for our country""? But, it was to most people because this is a SEQUEL! LABELS, LABELS, LABELS!

The T-Birds and Pink Ladies hang out at a bowling alley?  All the main ""kids"" are played by 35-40 year olds?  How Michelle Pfieffer actually managed to have a career after this is the question for all time being that she proves that she is neither a singer or dancer in this (even with a lot of help from a dubbing machine, her voice is barely passable).  The plot (what there is of it) seems like it was dreamed up by a dreamy twelve year old girl (the over the top drama is laughably bad).  Someone seemed to think that being a tough kid from the fifties means chewing gum in a loud and obnoxoius manner.  I hope there was a dentist on the set of this movie.  Who thought casting Adrian Zmed was a good idea?  (his stint on Dance Fever was more exposure than the American public should have been subjected to).  And we're to believe that motorcycle goggles will conceal a person's identity (are all the ""kids"" in this movie dimwitted?) A senior LUAU?  Don't waste your money even renting this tripe.

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[6, 9]","Four years after the highly successful comedy/musical ""Grease"" hit the big screen in 1978, an attempt was made to cash-in once more with a ill-conceived, poorly written sequel named ""Grease 2"".  Directed by Patricia Birch (who had worked as a choreographer on the original ""Grease"") and written by Ken Finkleman (who also wrote & directed the equally deplorable ""Airplane II: The Sequel"" the same year), this film's utterly unoriginal plot finds yet another Aussie student enrolling at Rydel High, and there, becoming smitten with a local American girl.  The clean-cut Aussie student, Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield, who is from Scotland, not Australia), in order to win the affections of Pink Lady Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer) must find a way to be accepted into this now motorcycle-obsessed counter-culture.  He gets a job, starts building a motorcycle from scratch, starts doing homework for the unremarkable T-Birds, oh, and agrees to perform in the school's talentless ""talent"" show.Clearly having nothing else to do on their schedules, several actors from the original 1978 ""Grease"" reprized their roles in this atrocious sequel to try and give it some legitimacy: Frenchy (Didi Conn) who apparently never graduated, Principal McGee (Eve Arden, 1908-1990), Coach Calhoun (Sid Caesar) and Blanche Hodel (1914-2008).  I am very happy to report that the creators of the original ""Grease"", Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey (1935-1988), had absolutely nothing to do with this celluloid disaster.  With an estimated $13.2-million budget, the film never earned that much in its combined box-office receipts.  It's also doubtful whether revenue from rentals & DVD/VHS sales ever put this bomb into the black.  Overall, my rating for ""Grease 2"" is 1 out of 5 stars.

From the title, you would assume that it's a sequel to the enormously popular ""Grease"" from several years earlier.  But no such luck.  Not only do John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John not even make a cameo appearance, neither do any of the other principal characters from the first film.  Further, ""Grease 2"" has very little to do with the original ""Grease"", other than taking its name for tie-in purposes, the fact that the ""hero"", Michael is ""Grease""'s Sandy's English cousin and the film is set at the fictional Rydell High.  Otherwise, ""Grease 2"" could not be further removed from ""Grease"".  True, G2 does attempt to be a musical.  With exceedingly painful results.  Nowhere will you find the catchy, time appropriate tunes that were pleasantly scattered throughout ""Grease"".  These offerings are dismal and just flat out horrid (""Reproduction"", sang during high school biology about pollen, etc. is particularly painful)The casting is equally bizarre.  Michelle Pfeiffer is lovely and her singing is not bad, but some of the scenes are embarassing to watch.  Maxwell Caufield doesn't have much to do with his role as a lovestruck shy Romeo.  Adrian Zmed was terribly miscast at the T-Birds' leader and ""bad boy"".  Lorna Luft was inexplicably cast as the Marilyn Monroe of the group (inexplicable due primarily to Luft's age).  As a whole, the actors were much too old to be playing high school students.The second deception point?

If that's the attitude you're  coming in with, you're not going to get much out of it.  Still, it's a good  movie.  Not a great movie.  It has its moments.  My personal favorites  involve the evil cheerleading twins and their duet &quot;Brad&quot;, as  well as the many different stages of the &quot;tree&quot; costume(I still  think the box with the picture and the word tree on it was the best).  At  Rydell High in 1961 apparently the girls are the ones with the backbones,  and the guys are chickens.  The cast does a good enough job with the  mediocre material they've been given.

I love this movie! Perhaps also because I had a big crush on Maxwell Caulfield's charactrer &quot;Michael&quot; so that made it all the more enjoyable for me to watch but I loved the soundtrack too, &quot;Who's that guy&quot; when Michael first appears at the bowling alley in his leather clothes on his new motorcycle, or &quot;Cool Rider&quot; the song that Michelle Pfiefer's character &quot;Stephanie&quot; sang to let him know he had to be a motorcycle rider before she could even give him the time of day. Or the song at the end, &quot;We'll be together&quot; makes me smile everytime I hear it, and I love the song &quot;Love will turn back the hands of time&quot; at the talent show when &quot;Stephanie&quot; spaces out thinking of her mystery &quot;cool&quot; rider who had since swept her off her feet. I think I rented this movie atleast 3 times a week from when I was 7 years old till I was 10 (back when you could only rent for a day at a time), let's just say it drove my parents crazy but I didn't want to watch anything else, finally they bought it for me when it went down in price and now I am anxious for it to be released on DVD because my VHS copy is rather played out because I watched it constantly. I always stop to watch this movie no matter what I am doing if it comes on tv and it never fails that when I just watched my VHS copy it comes on! But if anyone ever finds out it's coming out on DVD please LET ME KNOW! I think everyone should atleast give this movie a chance and pretend you had never seen Grease cause I hadn't seen it until a year after I had watched Grease 2 a hundred times and I wasn't expecting anything, I expect the first to be different since I first saw the sequel so for me, Grease is not as interesting to me, I enjoy Grease 2 far more!! Give it a try, hope you enjoy it, for those who love Grease I can see that it might not live up to what you expected but don't expect too much and give it a good playing and just enjoy it for it's comedy, high school romance, and soundtrack that some people don't like but I love it and I think a lot of the songs are highly enjoyable. thanks.",5,I LOVE GREASE 2!!,1016928000,"03 24, 2002",2002,2279,"['think', 'part', 'reason', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'grew', 'up', 'version', 'never', 'seeing', 'original', 'Grease', 'one', 'love', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'also', 'had', 'big', 'crush', 'Maxwell', 'Caulfield', 'charactrer', 'quot', 'Michael', 'quot', 'made', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'loved', 'soundtrack', 'too', 'quot', 'Who', 'guy', 'quot', 'when', 'Michael', 'first', 'bowling', 'alley', 'leather', 'clothes', 'new', 'motorcycle', 'quot', 'Cool', 'Rider', 'quot', 'song', 'Michelle', 'Pfiefer', 'character', 'quot', 'Stephanie', 'quot', 'sang', 'let', 'know', 'had', 'be', 'motorcycle', 'rider', 'could', 'even', 'give', 'time', 'day', 'song', 'end', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'be', 'together', 'quot', 'smile', 'everytime', 'hear', 'love', 'song', 'quot', 'Love', 'will', 'turn', 'back', 'hands', 'time', 'quot', 'talent', 'show', 'when', 'quot', 'Stephanie', 'quot', 'out', 'thinking', 'mystery', 'quot', 'cool', 'quot', 'rider', 'who', 'had', 'swept', 'feet', 'think', 'rented', 'movie', 'atleast', '3', 'times', 'week', 'when', 'was', '7', 'years', 'old', 'till', 'was', '10', 'back', 'when', 'could', 'only', 'rent', 'day', 'time', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'drove', 'parents', 'crazy', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'anything', 'else', 'finally', 'bought', 'when', 'went', 'down', 'price', 'now', 'am', 'anxious', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'copy', 'rather', 'played', 'out', 'watched', 'constantly', 'always', 'stop', 'watch', 'movie', 'matter', 'what', 'am', 'doing', 'tv', 'never', 'when', 'just', 'watched', 'VHS', 'copy', 'anyone', 'ever', 'out', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'please', 'LET', 'ME', 'KNOW', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'atleast', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'pretend', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Grease', 'cause', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'year', 'had', 'watched', 'Grease', '2', 'hundred', 'times', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'anything', 'expect', 'first', 'be', 'different', 'first', 'saw', 'sequel', 'so', 'Grease', 'not', 'interesting', 'enjoy', 'Grease', '2', 'far', 'more', 'Give', 'try', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'who', 'love', 'Grease', 'can', 'see', 'might', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'what', 'expected', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'give', 'good', 'playing', 'just', 'enjoy', 'comedy', 'high', 'school', 'romance', 'soundtrack', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'love', 'think', 'lot', 'songs', 'are', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'thanks']",N/A

Grease was a fun film that captured the hearts of many moviegoers back in the 70's and still captures a lot of hearts today.Grease 2 is without the first one's stars, but introduces the audience to new faces. Now this element is what people didn't like.Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield were given the hard task to fill the shoes of Travolta and Newton John. They do this with great charm, are easily liked and form the true beating heart of the film. Pfeiffer does a good job as the pink lady Stephanie in one of her first big movies. She also sings her own songs, with succes.Caulfield plays Sandy's (Yes, the Sandy from the first one) cousin who comes to Rydell High School to find himself falling in love with a girl that is ungettable in his position. Just like Pfeiffer, Caulfield's way of acting and the fun he brings to the role make this film enjoyable.As head of the T-birds the cool Adrian Zmed was given the part and gives a fun and cool performance. He clearly had a great time on set while filming.The film has a lot of fun new songs which are well written and have the quality to get stuck in your head.Grease 2 may not be as good as it's predecessor: it is a fun ride that shows the magic of the movie musical.So, try to forget the first Grease movie for a while and look at it as a standalone film. Cause then you'll see that the charm, the music and the actors bring to life a film that is definitely worth the watch.Grease 2 has begun to become more popular as time goes by.

Michelle Pfeiffer - she went on to become a huge star, so people want to see one of her very early films (possibly her first).  She does some embarrassing things in this movie, so that has helped make people want to see it.2. Maxwell Caulfied - this film stopped his career. Or was it his awful acting? Probably both.3.
