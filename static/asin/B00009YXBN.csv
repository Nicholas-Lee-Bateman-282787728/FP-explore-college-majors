759893,API5JLBRT6FIN,B00009YXBN,KNSudha,"[2, 6]","For me, to have those on DVD, with Steve whom my 3 year old loves makes this DVD worth the price of admission.  While Joe is pretty good, Steve has a quality that makes preschoolers feel like he is talking just to them!  The ABC's episode is fantastic for a three and up, as a 2 year old, it went above his head, and what they asked them to understand was too much, but now, on DVD he loved it and was able to participate right along -- they need to recognize first letters of words maybe to truly appreciate it.  The 123s episode is wonderful, teaches counting, addition, subtraction, more, haven't even watched the Joe episodes in 3 viewings.",5,The DVD has the ABC's and 123s VHS as bonus episodes,1067731200,"11 2, 2003",2003,644,"['have', 'DVD', 'Steve', 'whom', '3', 'year', 'old', 'DVD', 'price', 'admission', 'Joe', 'pretty', 'good', 'Steve', 'quality', 'preschoolers', 'feel', 'talking', 'just', 'ABC', 'episode', 'fantastic', 'three', 'up', '2', 'year', 'old', 'went', 'head', 'what', 'asked', 'understand', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'now', 'DVD', 'loved', 'was', 'able', 'participate', 'right', 'along', 'need', 'recognize', 'first', 'letters', 'words', 'maybe', 'truly', 'appreciate', '123s', 'episode', 'wonderful', 'teaches', 'counting', 'addition', 'subtraction', 'more', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'watched', 'Joe', 'episodes', '3', 'viewings']",Blue's Clues - Blue Takes You to School
