1621093,A2QVZIGRMOM3UP,B00B1RB83Y,Jonny Roy's film interests,"[1, 2]","Some pprobably read the story already but Dose Of Reality starts around at 2 in the morning. It's closing time for Matt (Ryan Merriman) a young bartender. When he happens to find an uncounscious, bloodied but gorgeous young woman (Fairuza Balk as Rose) on the bathroom floor, things immediately start to heat up from there. It grabs you and doesn't let go until the end.Acting as politically correct as can be, Matt immediately warns the bar manager (Rick Ravanello from the Cave and Hart's war.) This manager though is eager to take care of Rose and everything else only once she wakes up instead of alerting the cavalry and this is just what will make this adventure the more fun. Learning about each character each turn and telling yourself that what you thought was right might be wrong more than once is inevitable while watching Dose of Reality. And just like what used to make many thrillers great in the past, one must listen to the characters and watch them act in order to understand the next step in their behavior. And even with its kind of 360 turn around shocker ending that dear god I DIDN'T SEE COMING, watching Dose or Reality's cat and mouse type of suspense left me with some sort of a buzz that i didn't really care if i would like the ending or not. Watching this movie one time only feels like having fun once in your life and not going back at it. The second time, the route to the end is as fun, assuming you can forget about watching a movie only to get to the end. If third time's the charm, i can hardly wait til i have some more time to see it once more.This one is one hell of a ride. Filled with a couple characters that the average human being is bound to learn to hate, support, investigate and even encourage to act in some ways or other ways during the course of the story. I've watched a lot of movies, independant movies and if some people can't stand the amounts of monologues in some of them, let's say that Dose didn't even start to bore me on that aspect. And big part of the credit should go to Writer/Director Christopher Glatis on that part. Probably the most exciting and interesting thriller i've seen in years and exciting and interesting are 2 words that are too often ignored during this time of ridiculously gory and ridiculously stupid remakes of horror shockers and their characters trying to serve as today's heroes.Long story short, if you can watch a thriller, you will be served a hell of a film with Dose and even more if you can listen to a movie. If you've ever been in a bar or anywhere else near your house, you know that people aren't all one colour and shade and The actors in Dose do depict a cast of interesting, complicated characters that convince me more about some differences between the men and women and between the human and animal. All with really funny text and action scenes.Outsanding work by Rick Ravanello (The Cave, Hart's war), Ryan Merriman (Final Destination 3, The ring 2) and Fairuza Balk (The waterboy, American History x, the Craft) As a big fan of hers i was convinced she was one of the wonders of the ninethies (Talent wise.) when i was a teen. And you can easily grab that Dose of Reality if you love thrillers and realize this movie deserves way more credit than the commercial success it probably isn't yet. And after watching you'd be forced to say that this one's Fairuza Balk strongest performance to date and that is a big deal. She's amazing.Have a Dose of a great film.

Matt (Ryan Merriman) the bar tender discovers a woman (Fairuza Balk) passed out on the restroom floor. She has apparently been beaten and raped. Tony (Rick Ravanello), the bar manager, is less concerned. He is a two strike ex-con who still snorts drugs.When Rose comes to, she wants to discover which one of these guys did this to her. She plays mind games with them, antagonizes them and there are things that don't mesh, but too minor to be concerned about as the scene is too powerful and draws you away from the clue. As it turns out, Rose has multiple personality syndrome and moves smartly between characters. The action grows rather intense as we watch this personality driven script which at times is a dark comedy. Rose has two diverse personalities which are as diverse as Matt and Tony.After an hour into the film, things come together, and then all hell breaks loose as the plot twists and twists and becomes a delicious pretzel.
