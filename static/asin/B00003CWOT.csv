518081,AYQY3RB33F4J6,B00003CWOT,3rdeadly3rd,"[0, 0]","Eddie Izzard is, quite frankly, the funniest man in Britain right now and quite possibly the funniest man in the world. To call him a stand-up comedian is to oversimplify the point, Izzard's routines feature bizarre takes on history and culture all delivered in a free-associative way. There is simply no point of comparison.""Dress To Kill"" is one of his more famous routines and features a number of his more popular stories. Beginning with a description of San Francisco (where this particular performance was filmed), Izzard quickly segues into a romp through European history, a dissection of ""The American Dream"" and a look at the Church of England. As if that wasn't enough, there's various interesting observations on the Heimlich Manoevre, Englebert Humperdinck and losing one's virginity - before a performance of some of these same stories in French.In other words, this is a highly surreal performance. He often expects a little more of his audience than most comics do, which is probably a good thing. As he remarks in the middle of the French section of his routine, ""If you don't speak French, this is hilarious"". Nothing is sacred - particularly not the Spanish Inquisition (the source of the immortal ""Cake or Death"" routine) and the concept of ""putting babies on sticks"". Yes, it's disturbing. Yes, the fact that he's an ""executive transvestite"" might put some people off. But when you get past his crazy accents and fetish for certain old movie stars it is absolutely compulsory viewing.For any fans of British comedy, ""Dress To Kill"" is just about as good as it gets. The surrealism is laid on with a trowel and so many of his ideas are almost from another planet. For people who like their comedy to be easily explicable, this is probably something to avoid.",5,Complete Insanity Onstage,1115683200,"05 10, 2005",2005,1778,"['Eddie', 'Izzard', 'quite', 'frankly', 'funniest', 'man', 'Britain', 'right', 'now', 'quite', 'possibly', 'funniest', 'man', 'world', 'call', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'oversimplify', 'point', 'Izzard', 'routines', 'feature', 'bizarre', 'history', 'culture', 'delivered', 'free-associative', 'way', 'simply', 'point', 'comparison', 'Dress', 'Kill', 'one', 'more', 'famous', 'routines', 'number', 'more', 'popular', 'stories', 'Beginning', 'description', 'San', 'Francisco', 'where', 'particular', 'performance', 'was', 'filmed', 'Izzard', 'quickly', 'romp', 'European', 'history', 'dissection', 'American', 'Dream', 'look', 'Church', 'England', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'various', 'interesting', 'observations', 'Heimlich', 'Manoevre', 'Englebert', 'Humperdinck', 'losing', 'one', 'virginity', 'performance', 'same', 'stories', 'French.In', 'other', 'words', 'highly', 'surreal', 'performance', 'often', 'little', 'more', 'audience', 'most', 'comics', 'do', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'remarks', 'middle', 'French', 'section', 'routine', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'French', 'hilarious', 'Nothing', 'sacred', 'particularly', 'not', 'Spanish', 'Inquisition', 'source', 'immortal', 'Cake', 'Death', 'routine', 'concept', 'putting', 'babies', 'sticks', 'Yes', 'disturbing', 'Yes', 'fact', 'executive', 'transvestite', 'might', 'put', 'people', 'off', 'when', 'get', 'crazy', 'accents', 'fetish', 'certain', 'old', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'compulsory', 'viewing.For', 'fans', 'British', 'comedy', 'Dress', 'Kill', 'just', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'surrealism', 'laid', 'trowel', 'so', 'many', 'ideas', 'are', 'almost', 'planet', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'comedy', 'be', 'easily', 'explicable', 'probably', 'something', 'avoid']",Eddie Izzard - Dress to Kill [VHS]

518083,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00003CWOT,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 17]","Before last night, I must confess that I was an Eddie Izzard virgin.  While I may have witnessed him in several film roles, it wasn't until this moment did I honestly know who this man was, how he thought, or that is true calling was in front of a large American audience making us chuckle at ourselves.  Izzard is a transvestite, and is not ashamed to announce this to his audiences.  Our first image of Izzard is in full make-up dressed as a female, little did I know that this was actually his ""signature"" appearance.  Again, this is something that you do not know about the man while simply watching his films.  If you want to experience Izzard for the first time, I think any of his one-man routines would be of help.  Like a bottle of fresh wine, my wife and I chose Dress to Kill as our first sip of Izzard.  I suppose it is as good as anywhere to begin.  So, one fateful Saturday night, we popped his DVD into our player, sat ourselves down, and began the nearly two hour adventure into the mind of Eddie Izzard.  Needless to say, I was both impressed and unimpressed all at once.Izzard's routine, like a small child dealing with ADD, was all over the place.  We open Dress to Kill with an homage of sorts to the San Francisco trolley line coupled with Alcatraz.  It is a random opening, which should have given us an indication of what Izzard's performance was about to transform into.  With inconsistent voice-overs about the people riding the trolley to nearly annoying repetitive wording, we are swept into the auditorium finally to see Izzard in person.  Dressed rather feminine, he dashes on stage and begins his bits about politics, Britain, and history.  Izzard, is literally, all over the place with his comedy.  Spewing bits of humor mixed with, what I would later learn as classic, mumbles, pauses, and what felt like a complete lack of focus.  Don't get me wrong, there were some bits that just would make you laugh with delight.  Some that I remember were the ""cake or death"", Hollywood British villains, the American way, and his classic ""yes/no"" routine.  Sadly, these humorous elements nearly clashed with his random tangents, which went quickly into a fast rewind back to his memorized routine.It is obvious that Eddie Izzard is a smart man.  From his routine, in which historical dates and events are obviously a excitable subject for him, you can see where his strengths and weaknesses are.  His weakness, in my eyes, is the audience.  It becomes abundantly clear midway through his bits that he will fall way off the subject if it is something the audience attaches itself to.  In one aspect he would be discussing how the British loved to land on islands and place a flag there to call their own, the audience would laugh, he would go off on a tangent, and suddenly, ten minutes later, he would go back to that original thought.  After a few times of doing this, I was annoyed.  It is my belief that Izzard is a funny person by nature.  He has the ability to make audiences laugh because of his eclectic style and excitement, sadly, what fails in this performance is his lack of formal comedy training.  Now, I am no expert in the matter, but watching other famous comedians perform their routines, there seems to be a level of professionalism surrounding them.  Watch Ray Romano, Rodney Dangerfield, or Jerry Seinfeld do their shows and you will witness a clean, crisp show which demonstrates to me that these performers actually rehearsed, rehearsed, and rehearsed again to get it right.  Izzard, it was obvious, did not.  Maybe he did, but in Dress to Kill it just felt like he read the newspaper one day, thought of some funny jokes, memorized a pattern, and nearly forgot it while on stage.  He seemed sporadic and completely unprepared.  I need to watch more Izzard, maybe this is his style, but for me, it seemed cheap and distorted.Coupled with Izzard's procrastination approach to comedy, the production value on this DVD felt like a late 80s release.  I felt like I was watching an RPG game in which the camera angle goes everywhere except for the places that you instantly need it.  Either the cameraman was drunk or the director just loved jumping from angle to angle.  As viewers, we would find ourselves with a full shot of Izzard, then jump to a distance shot, to some random audience angle, and followed by some other random angle.  We couldn't just stay in one place, but just like Izzard's routine, seemed to be all over the place with no consistency.  Like most comedy DVDs, I wanted to see the audience laughing, I wanted to see more of Izzard's expressions (which, in my humble opinion, are his best traits), I wanted to see more of Izzard in general.  The quality of this DVD does not enhance the quality of Izzard's show, sadly, it only seems to bring the overall production value down.Overall, if I were asked to watch another Eddie Izzard one-man stand-up routine, I would proudly say ""yes"".  Perhaps this was one of his less valued tours (which is strange because it is this one that won him the most awards), but I want to give Izzard another chance.  Eddie Izzard is hysterical when he works on his routine.  His random interjections can be funny, but it is his well-developed jokes and commentary that really make his style of comedy stand out.  I am eager to watch his ""action"" transvestite on screen and watch this ""full-of-potential"" comic develop in his career.  Would I suggest this DVD to friends?  I think that I would for the tasty cookies crumbled between ill-placed jokes, but I do not think I could watch Dress to Kill another time.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Cake or Death?,1138492800,"01 29,

And does it very well. He amongst other things describes why the church of England couldn't have been the force behind the Spanish Inquisition, ""death or cake!"". He also touches on stonehenge, Hitler, Hollywood v. Britain, world history, the European Dream, much more. He is, in a word, hillarious. His slightly intellectual take on comedy (more in the choosing of subjects than in the treatment of them really), is one of the major factors in his being such a great comedian. He cleverly avoids the ""trap"" of talking about the differences about men and women or sex (which is all funny enough once in a while when you've had 8 pints and such, but it's getting a bit stale), and instead looks at the absurdities and wickedness of life and history in general. Also his way of delivering the jokes in a seemingly random and brain storming sort of way, supported by his mumbling facts he dosen't know, changing (to totally unrelated) subjects with no link, and his speaking French now and then, help make the show even funnier. I've seen it 4 times and it had me in stitches every single time. I think John Cleese was spot on, when he said that Eddie Izzard is ""the lost Python"".Well, anyway, you'd have to see it for yourself.

He has this way about him that makes it seem like he has no idea what is going to come next and that his skit is never, truly rehearsed. In fact, if you have never watched him before perhaps you would believe that he has no clue as to where the night will take him. That is not the case, but his performance is what I am talking about and it is tip top to say the least. For nearly three hours he will give you something to laugh about!One of his favorite themes to stick with is history. If you're a history buff you will love Eddie!

I popped the DVD in the player practically frothing at the mouth with excitement...and suddenly, the laughs just started bursting out from everywhere! This DVD, from start to finish, is a GEM! Buy it! Stop reading my review, and just Buy it! Go! Get your credit card, and Buy it! Okay... Now, a word of caution: I suffer from asthma, and a really sour sense of humor, so until this point, I had never witnessed anything I found to be even remotely this funny before. Therefore, I was not prepared for the consequences of mixing laughter and asthma. Basically, about half an hour into the DVD, I had been laughing so hard, I was literally was having an asthma attack from all the hysterical laughter! So, I had to stop the DVD, CALM DOWN, get my inhaler, and wait a whole HOUR before I could start watching it again. Then, to my complete Joy/Horror, his routine continued to be so funny, my laughing started right up again and didn't even slow down till I ejected the DVD. Thusly, another asthma attack ensued. BUT I DIDN'T CARE! I was so overjoyed and enraptured with his performance, I would have died happy with my inhaler in my hand!

This is an incredible performance that demonstrates the depth and breadth of Izzard's talent. I cannot tell you how many times I have watched it and every time I still laugh. In fact, he was on the other night on HBO and I still had to watch the whole thing.For those of you not familiar with him, Izzard is a transvestite who engages in a type of comedy that is more of a one-man show than a stand-up routine. While one might think that his tranvestism would be the main focus of the show, it isn't. While he uses it as a point of comedy briefly, the show really focuses on what it is like to live in this world. The show is a satirical look at cultures and history. He mocks nearly all western Europeans, and then reminds us that we native English speakers perhaps miss out on a whole view of the world because we are so constricted by our language. In addition, he also attacks law and politics and our American tradition of not knowing any world history.Yet, while his humor addresses pretty heady material, don't be fooled into believing that it is inaccessible or overwrought with discussion. This is not an NPR comedy special. This is bare bones hard humor that keeps you rolling in the isle each time you watch. My only regret is that it isn't available on DVD or VHS. Until then, go see it if you can in a theater. If you want something now, I would highly recommend Glorious, an earlier show done in England in which Izzard discusses the Bible.

He is from England and has that sharp wit and satirical sharpness that would make anyone one who is even somewhat sensible (or intelligent) laugh out loud. He has also done some acting and been featured in movies like The Avengers, Mystery Men and Oceans Twelve as well as others.His insights into history, religion, American Culture and even our own presidents are amazingly accurate - if not someone satirical with a resounding ring of ""truth"". What makes you laugh is not the fact that he is the self proclaim ""Executive Transvestite"" (he likes women) - but the way in which he tells the ironies of history. Questions that, now in hindsight, we can ask not and actually say, ""what were they thinking"".His color visions and interpretations and even impressions are astonishingly humorous and right on target. He does where a dress and high heals and make-up too, but he addresses all of that as well. He even plays with the audience and tells a few stories that are true - well maybe not - well yes they are - well then again......it's hysterical watching him do that!This particular concert was done in San Francisco and back in 1999. It has to be the funniest of the bunch - although his other concerts are as sharp as this one! He has a great time even with the San Francisco natives as well. You can tell he knows what he is talking about because of the audience's reactions and hysterical laughter.This DVD extras have something unique. The commentary is in two different languages. English and French. Also there is a whole separate concert on this DVD that he did in France and yes it is all in French. Directed by Lawrence Jorden, a renowned director of music videos, concerts and TV Specials including - Barry Manilow, Duran Duran, John Mellencamp, Dave Mathews, David Bowie and many more - this concert works on Many levels. This DVD is fun, funny and intelligent. If you like intelligent humor - this concert is for you! You'll watch it over and over and stil laugh every time!

He was so honored because Mr. Williams, one of America's ultimate performers, said he was very funny.  I've known this since the first time I saw Eddie on ""Late Show with David Letterman,"" and the fact was most certainly reaffirmed by watching D2K.This was Eddie's big American break, an HBO special geared to a fickle audience that frequently cries out for originality.  This laugh-a-minute fest was just what they needed.  Eddie not only makes us think about our world (topics like war, religion, and gun control), but he finds humor in unexpected places (such as the Heimlich manuever, the moon landing).  He can also laugh at himself and his own country.  Apparently, the UK is cleaning the windows of the European car.What separates him from many comedians today (and links him with Mr. Williams in a way) is his unstoppable energy and the lively characterization he puts into every word.  It amazes me that he performed for an entire hour without one sip of water!  He commands attention and his audience hangs on the whole time.His Emmy award wins for this special almost guarantee him another go on HBO, if that's what he wants.  For the sake of American audiences who are unfamiliar with his previous shows, I hope he takes the stage again.  His fanbase can only continue to grow.Funny parts to look for in this video:  the transvestite airborne wing, Sean Connery as the ""big hairy king,"" the French lesson, the druids and Stonehenge, weirdo transvestite vs. executive transvestite, Engelbert Humperdinck, and the real way to say ""leisure.""

On the one hand, he's clearly intelligent and educated and his comedy contains much that will tickle even the most intellectual of viewers.

Eddie Izzard is hilarious.  When I bought this I figured it was worth a watch and could be auctioned if I did not like it.  However, this and Circle- Eddie's 2nd or maybe 1st DVD are worthy additions to Williams and Miller.  Eddie, I salute you sir.  FYI- the sound and video are decent, for a made for cable special.

I was amazed by his ability to make a sidesplitting joke out of topics that no other comedian has even considered. Izzard's show is more than just funny; it is also a lesson in history and culture, but with a twist that only he can pull off.The show runs about 1 hour and 40 minutes and is hilarious-not just funny-for the *entire* time. Some of my favorite highlights: He compares Hitler to a disgruntled painter who will ""kill them all"" when he can't get his trees drawn right. He pokes fun at our inability to recite our National Anthem. He says that Neil Armstrong couldn't have gotten out of the Apollo spacecraft and said ""Oh, it's all sticky!"" He impersonates Darth Vader with an English accent, discusses his experiences with ""the plague"" of puberty, insists that the Mormons ""really are from Mars,"" and elevates Shaggy and Scooby to some of the greatest literary characters of all time.And that's not even the tip of the iceberg. Add to all of this Eddie's accent, his outrageous platform shoes, dress, hairstyle, lipstick, and the ways he contorts his face, and you have all the ingredients for the greatest stand up comedy show ever.People who have seen Izzard's show end up quoting it on a daily basis, and just remembering certain lines is enough to make you chuckle for a few minutes. If you like stand up comedy, history, or you just want to laugh over and over again, add this show to your collection.The DVD includes his show in Paris (in French), a photo documentary, and commentaries on both stand up shows, but the main attraction is the show itself.

Eddie Izzard being a transvestite really has nothing to do with his comedy because he is smart, international and hilarious and his being transvestite is really quite secondary to his intelligent style of comedy. He does have that kind of ""British"" humor that's dry and some people may not get it.Pascal Meunier (see his other reviews for a sample of his tastes) on a previous review on this page said this wasn't funny & that Izzard ""babbles & pisses on everything."" Talk about inaccurate!!! Negative reviews only get ""not helpful"" when there is a lopsided or un-defended attack on a person or product. If well written with a substantiated argument, a negative review can be quite helpful. His complaint was that he got this DVD on the strength of misleading reviews. I will give a full & complete review for any other prospective buyersFirstly, Izzard doesn't ""piss"" on everything- he is an observer of everything. One of the truest & best observations he makes is the one that people like Pol Pot and Stalin killed people in their own country & basically got away with it because, as he said, ""we're kinda fine with that, we've been trying to kill you for years!"" but of course, Hitler, silly man, killed people next door and we won't stand for that after a while. Like most comedy (for example Chris Rock saying when you date people they don't meet you, they meet your representative,) Izzard's comedy is funny because it is observations of things we all know are TRUE. I couldn't help notice that Robin Williams, who has a similar style of fast, smart comedy, was one of the producers of this show. I would guess HE thinks he's funny. As for a comparison to George Carlin, one of my personal favorites, that's really quite useless because everyone's comedy is different. I'm a big Robert Schimmel fan & his comedy is generally crude, sexual and outrageous- outrageously funny, but different. That is why there are so many different types of comedians, something for everyone. I guess Eddie is an intellectuals' comedian- and what's wrong with that? Isn't it about time?He has funny jokes about Henry VIII who basically shagged women & killed them, about the Anglican Church being too lenient and offering ""cake or death"" in their theoretical inquisition. The international clout of Scooby-Doo and the ""Falstaff"" comparison is great. I never go to an action flick at the theatre eating popcorn with out thinking of his ""Room with a View of Hell, staircase of Satan!"" Or his hilarious take on the Heimlich Maneuver or Englebert Humperdink/Jerry Dorsey and his name. There is just so much in this that is funny, and now that I've been watching it while writing my review - he isn't pissing on everything- to the contrary, he's amazingly positive actually- especially compared to most comedians (for example Carlin)!This is a great comedian and a wonderful stand-up concert that you will watch over & over- luckily, as another reviewer said, it gets funnier each time you watch it. 6 stars out of 5!!!!!",5,"EXTREMELY FUNNY, if you have a brain....",1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,3130,"['was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'catch', 'special', 'HBO', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'cried', 'sides', 'hurt', 'good', 'kind', 'hurt', 'course', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'being', 'transvestite', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'comedy', 'smart', 'international', 'hilarious', 'being', 'transvestite', 'really', 'quite', 'secondary', 'intelligent', 'style', 'comedy', 'have', 'kind', 'British', 'humor', 'dry', 'people', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'it.Pascal', 'Meunier', 'see', 'other', 'reviews', 'sample', 'tastes', 'previous', 'review', 'page', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Izzard', 'babbles', 'pisses', 'everything', 'Talk', 'inaccurate', 'Negative', 'reviews', 'only', 'get', 'not', 'helpful', 'when', 'lopsided', 'un-defended', 'attack', 'person', 'product', 'well', 'written', 'substantiated', 'argument', 'negative', 'review', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'helpful', 'complaint', 'was', 'got', 'DVD', 'strength', 'misleading', 'reviews', 'will', 'give', 'full', 'complete', 'review', 'other', 'prospective', 'buyersFirstly', 'Izzard', ""n't"", 'piss', 'everything-', 'observer', 'everything', 'One', 'truest', 'best', 'observations', 'one', 'people', 'Pol', 'Pot', 'Stalin', 'killed', 'people', 'own', 'country', 'basically', 'got', 'away', 'because', 'said', ""'re"", 'kinda', 'fine', ""'ve"", 'been', 'trying', 'kill', 'years', 'course', 'Hitler', 'silly', 'man', 'killed', 'people', 'door', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stand', 'while', 'most', 'comedy', 'example', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'saying', 'when', 'date', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'meet', 'meet', 'representative', 'Izzard', 'comedy', 'funny', 'observations', 'things', 'know', 'are', 'TRUE', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'similar', 'style', 'fast', 'smart', 'comedy', 'was', 'one', 'producers', 'show', 'would', 'guess', 'HE', 'funny', 'comparison', 'George', 'Carlin', 'one', 'personal', 'favorites', 'really', 'quite', 'useless', 'everyone', 'comedy', 'different', ""'m"", 'big', 'Robert', 'Schimmel', 'fan', 'comedy', 'generally', 'crude', 'sexual', 'outrageous-', 'outrageously', 'funny', 'different', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'types', 'comedians', 'something', 'everyone', 'guess', 'Eddie', 'intellectuals', 'comedian-', 'what', 'wrong', ""n't"", 'time', 'funny', 'jokes', 'Henry', 'VIII', 'who', 'basically', 'shagged', 'women', 'killed', 'Anglican', 'Church', 'being', 'too', 'lenient', 'offering', 'cake', 'death', 'theoretical', 'inquisition', 'international', 'clout', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Falstaff', 'comparison', 'great', 'never', 'go', 'action', 'flick', 'theatre', 'eating', 'popcorn', 'out', 'thinking', 'Room', 'View', 'Hell', 'staircase', 'Satan', 'hilarious', 'take', 'Heimlich', 'Maneuver', 'Englebert', 'Humperdink/Jerry', 'Dorsey', 'name', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'funny', 'now', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'writing', 'review', ""n't"", 'pissing', 'everything-', 'contrary', 'amazingly', 'positive', 'actually-', 'especially', 'compared', 'most', 'comedians', 'example', 'Carlin', 'great', 'comedian', 'wonderful', 'stand-up', 'concert', 'will', 'watch', 'over-', 'luckily', 'reviewer', 'said', 'funnier', 'time', 'watch', '6', 'stars', '5']",Eddie Izzard - Dress to Kill [VHS]

But somehow, he seems to have broken the trans-Atlantic barriers and become ridiculously popular with Americans.  Strange because he does tend to take the piss out of them, right there, in their faces and they just keep laughing.  Fantastic!Eddie is an acquired taste.  Forget the transvestite shtick, he's been doing it for so long it's just a diversion from his genius.  Eddie isn't the joke, punchline comic.  He's stream of conscious, surreal and observational, and if you can keep up, you're doing well.  Eddie seems to live in Eddie-world, where dogs talk and 'they're not happy with their wash'.  See what I mean?Dress To Kill is probably my favourite of the Izzard shows.  It's definitely got the strongest laugh factor.  Other shows have better belly laughs, but they're more sporadic.  On DTK, he never lets up; from 'San Francisco is full of snakes' to the brilliant 'British films are like, I say, you, me, I, er..' and American heros via The Great Escape and Star Wars. Oh dear, I'm crying with laughter just thinking about it!Like I said before, Izzard is not for everyone.  Yes, he wears dresses and makeup, even though he's built like a truck driver and he does tend to do the same tranny humour routine early on in every show which can tiresome, but he's pretty much as close to comedic genius as you can get.  The DVD captures his delivery perfectly - he does tend to trip up on his thoughts and forget what he was talking about.  But it's part of the charm, of course.You may want to start with Unrepeatable (DVD), which will get you started on the Izzard vibe.  He has a habit of developing a couple of his jokes through his shows, so sometimes there is inside reference for his true fans that you may just miss.  Don't worry though, Dressed to Kill can be viewed by anyone and you really won't miss a beat. If you're disappointed by this DVD, then I will eat my hat.

I know if I were an audience member watching this coma-inducing roll of wall-to-wall lameness, I'd've stormed the box office threatening to sue if I didn't get a full refund!The only time I had even an inkle of emotional reaction to this travesty was when I sighed in relief as the closing credits rolled. A few minutes later, however, I became depressed when I realized I just wasted an hour of my life watching this heapin' load o' dreck! I'd've had a better time listening to the recitation of the minutes from the British Parliament's last session than watching this loser!Then there's the whole dressing in drag thing, which is pretty much clich&eacute; nowadays. Personally, I think it's his way of kissing up to the original British comedy drag-sters, Monty Python's Flying Circus (of course, his claim will be that his cross-dressing is a `tribute' to the Pythons, but I see right through that ploy!). If you doubt it, take a look at his little walk-on with MPFC's five surviving members at the beginning of the `Life of Python' interview special. C'mon, now, Edward; stop licking the boots of those has-beens! Just because the late Graham Chapman is funnier deceased than you will ever be while you're alive doesn't mean you shouldn't try to be your own man(?)!`LateUPDATE 3/20/2005:Now I know what some of you are thinking after reading my little rant: you see me as some sorta anti-intellectual rube who just doesn't ""get"" most of Mr. Izzard's material, don'cha? You probably think that most of his references and allegedly humorous takes on significant events in European history (i.e. the Crusades) sailed right over my pointy little pin-head, don'cha? It probably didn't even remotely occur to you that perhaps I did grok just about every last bit of this man's so-called ""humor""... which I did, BTW... and I just didn't think it was funny? I know this is a tough revelation to wrap your brain around, but just try it. Don't be scared, now...Then there are a few of you who're saying to yourselves, ""Ahh, he's just some disgruntled Yank who's biased against British comedy!"" Sorry to disappoint you, but I consider Are You Being Served?&trade; to be one of the funniest sitcoms ever made, and I rather enjoy the weirdness of Monty Python's Flying Circus&trade;, Fawlty Towers&trade;, and The Black Adder&trade;. The late Benny Hill&trade; had his moments as well! And to top things off: ""Danger Mouse"" was one of my all-time fave cartoon shows when I was but a wee 'Norch!Others of you are thinking, ""Ahhh, the guy's just jealous of Izzard's success."" True, I must admit I am rather envious of this no-talent yutz who has managed to break into show biz and has been modestly successful at it... well, if you consider small parts in Mystery Men&trade; and the cinematic adaptation of The Avengers&trade; to be a couple of sturdy rungs up the ladder to the big time... while being completely unfunny. Going by that logic, I am also very jealous of Paulie Shore!Finally, there're those of you who are saying to yourselves: ""Sheesh, this guy's a real scumbag!""My reply to this: your point being...?`Later",1,Almost as Funny as Carrot Top!,1035504000,"10 25, 2002",2002,4287,"['caught', 'particular', 'show', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'HBO', 'whilst', 'switchin', 'channels', 'decided', 'stay', 'tuned', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'Eddie', 'Izzard', 'guy', 'was', 'Sadly', 'was', ""n't"", 'being', 'funny', 'observation', 'most', 'Star', 'Wars', 'trade', 'villains', 'are', 'British', 'was', ""n't"", 'amusing', 'found', 'man', 'act', 'veritable', 'bomberoo', 'endured', 'pathetically', 'unfunny', 'piece', 'tripe', 'beginning', 'end', 'uttering', 'so', 'much', 'soft', 'chuckle', 'found', 'slowly', 'slipping', 'catatonic', 'state', 'utter', 'boredom', 'doled', 'out', 'insipid', 'pointless', 'ramblings', 'Scooby-Doo', 'trade', 'lame', 'spiel', 'coming', 'up', 'original', 'sin', 'cake', 'death', 'bit', 'went', 'nowhere', 'fast', 'nodding-and-shaking-his-head', 'dealy', 'milked', 'REALLY', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'about', 'two', 'minutes', 'punctuate', 'other', 'pitiful', 'bit', 'his.In', 'fact', 'only', 'laughing', 'heard', 'was', 'audience', 'most', 'likely', 'polite', 'laughter', 'know', 'kinda', 'come', 'when', 'audience', ""n't"", 'actually', 'think', 'man', 'jokes', 'were', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'wan', 'na', 'bring', 'down', 'Yeah', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'know', 'were', 'audience', 'member', 'watching', 'coma-inducing', 'roll', 'wall-to-wall', 'lameness', ""I'd"", ""'ve"", 'stormed', 'box', 'office', 'threatening', 'sue', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'full', 'refund', 'only', 'time', 'had', 'even', 'inkle', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'travesty', 'was', 'when', 'sighed', 'relief', 'closing', 'credits', 'rolled', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'however', 'became', 'depressed', 'when', 'realized', 'just', 'wasted', 'hour', 'life', 'watching', 'heapin', 'load', 'o', 'dreck', ""I'd"", ""'ve"", 'had', 'better', 'time', 'listening', 'recitation', 'minutes', 'British', 'Parliament', 'last', 'session', 'watching', 'loser', 'Then', 'whole', 'dressing', 'drag', 'thing', 'pretty', 'much', 'clich', 'eacute', 'nowadays', 'Personally', 'think', 'way', 'kissing', 'up', 'original', 'British', 'comedy', 'drag-sters', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Flying', 'Circus', 'course', 'claim', 'will', 'be', 'cross-dressing', 'tribute', 'Pythons', 'see', 'right', 'ploy', 'doubt', 'take', 'look', 'little', 'walk-on', 'MPFC', 'five', 'surviving', 'members', 'beginning', 'Life', 'Python', 'interview', 'special', ""C'mon"", 'now', 'Edward', 'stop', 'licking', 'boots', 'has-beens', 'Just', 'late', 'Graham', 'Chapman', 'funnier', 'deceased', 'will', 'ever', 'be', ""'re"", 'alive', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'own', 'man', 'LateUPDATE', '3/20/2005', 'Now', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'reading', 'little', 'rant', 'see', 'sorta', 'anti-intellectual', 'rube', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'most', 'Mr.', 'Izzard', 'material', ""don'cha"", 'probably', 'think', 'most', 'references', 'allegedly', 'humorous', 'significant', 'events', 'European', 'history', 'i.e', 'Crusades', 'sailed', 'right', 'pointy', 'little', 'pin-head', ""don'cha"", 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'remotely', 'occur', 'perhaps', 'did', 'grok', 'just', 'about', 'last', 'bit', 'man', 'so-called', 'humor', 'did', 'BTW', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'funny', 'know', 'tough', 'revelation', 'wrap', 'brain', 'just', 'try', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'scared', 'now', 'Then', 'are', 'few', 'who', ""'re"", 'saying', 'yourselves', 'Ahh', 'just', 'disgruntled', 'Yank', 'who', 'biased', 'British', 'comedy', 'Sorry', 'disappoint', 'consider', 'Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'trade', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'sitcoms', 'ever', 'made', 'rather', 'enjoy', 'weirdness', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Flying', 'Circus', 'trade', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'trade', 'Black', 'Adder', 'trade', 'late', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'trade', 'had', 'moments', 'well', 'top', 'things', 'Danger', 'Mouse', 'was', 'one', 'all-time', 'fave', 'cartoon', 'shows', 'when', 'was', 'wee', ""'Norch"", 'Others', 'are', 'thinking', 'Ahhh', 'guy', 'just', 'jealous', 'Izzard', 'success', 'True', 'must', 'admit', 'am', 'rather', 'envious', 'no-talent', 'yutz', 'who', 'managed', 'break', 'show', 'biz', 'been', 'modestly', 'successful', 'well', 'consider', 'small', 'parts', 'Mystery', 'Men', 'trade', 'cinematic', 'adaptation', 'Avengers', 'trade', 'be', 'couple', 'sturdy', 'rungs', 'ladder', 'big', 'time', 'being', 'completely', 'unfunny', 'Going', 'logic', 'am', 'also', 'very', 'jealous', 'Paulie', 'Shore', 'Finally', ""'re"", 'who', 'are', 'saying', 'yourselves', 'Sheesh', 'guy', 'real', 'scumbag', 'reply', 'point', 'being', 'Later']",Eddie Izzard - Dress to Kill [VHS]
