1383782,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B0042XPF74,Compay,"[5, 7]","The Heavy is one of those movies that's a great treat for the eyes, but otherwise tells a dull story.  The movie follows two brothers in London: a politician and an ex-con henchman.  Their relationship becomes clouded by betrayal, and eventually the opportunity for revenge.The good news is that The Heavy is shot really well.  Marcus Warren makes his directorial debut with this film, and he scores with the visuals.  The cinematography and editing are great, and the color correction is much better than your typical Redbox flick.  Not to mention Warren is working with a solid cast of established actors.The problem is that Marcus Warren also wrote the screenplay, and the writing is miserable.  Boring dialogue, plot holes, abandoned sub-plots, and a story that moves along at a snail's pace.  Much of the film is predictable, and tends to drag on.Christopher Lee (Saruman of LOTR) and Irish actor Stephen Rea are welcome additions to the cast, but only have bit roles.  I'm a long time fan of the always-intense Vinnie Jones, who steals most of the scenes in The Heavy playing a corrupt London cop.  Jones makes up for the shamefully one-dimensional acting of Gary Stretch, who plays the lead character ""Boots"" with less energy than a DMV employee.  Hawaiian beauty Shannyn Sossamon is drop-dead gorgeous as a mysterious American who becomes entangled with Boots, and is one of the few reasons I kept interest as the film plodded along.  The bottom line is that most of the cast is great, but their talents are wasted with absolutely weak writing and dialogue.This could have been a nice indie cult classic had the story been better.  If you're an action junkie, you'll be disappointed by the serious lack of fighting and gunplay (not even a requisite car chase).  Overall, The Heavy looks so much better than most straight-to-video movies, but the story and writing were a let down.  Give this one a rent before you even consider buying it.",3,Great Visuals but Weak Writing,1292889600,"12 21, 2010",2010,1946,"['Heavy', 'one', 'movies', 'great', 'treat', 'eyes', 'otherwise', 'dull', 'story', 'movie', 'two', 'brothers', 'London', 'politician', 'ex-con', 'henchman', 'relationship', 'becomes', 'clouded', 'betrayal', 'eventually', 'opportunity', 'revenge.The', 'good', 'news', 'Heavy', 'shot', 'really', 'well', 'Marcus', 'Warren', 'directorial', 'debut', 'film', 'visuals', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'are', 'great', 'color', 'correction', 'much', 'better', 'typical', 'Redbox', 'flick', 'Not', 'mention', 'Warren', 'working', 'solid', 'cast', 'established', 'actors.The', 'problem', 'Marcus', 'Warren', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'writing', 'miserable', 'Boring', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'holes', 'abandoned', 'sub-plots', 'story', 'along', 'snail', 'pace', 'Much', 'film', 'predictable', 'drag', 'Lee', 'Saruman', 'LOTR', 'Irish', 'actor', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'are', 'welcome', 'additions', 'cast', 'only', 'have', 'bit', 'roles', ""'m"", 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'always-intense', 'Vinnie', 'Jones', 'who', 'most', 'scenes', 'Heavy', 'playing', 'corrupt', 'London', 'cop', 'Jones', 'up', 'shamefully', 'one-dimensional', 'acting', 'Gary', 'Stretch', 'who', 'lead', 'character', 'Boots', 'less', 'energy', 'DMV', 'employee', 'Hawaiian', 'beauty', 'Shannyn', 'Sossamon', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'mysterious', 'American', 'who', 'entangled', 'Boots', 'one', 'few', 'reasons', 'kept', 'interest', 'film', 'plodded', 'along', 'bottom', 'line', 'most', 'cast', 'great', 'talents', 'are', 'wasted', 'absolutely', 'weak', 'writing', 'dialogue.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'indie', 'cult', 'classic', 'had', 'story', 'been', 'better', ""'re"", 'action', 'junkie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'serious', 'lack', 'fighting', 'gunplay', 'not', 'even', 'requisite', 'car', 'chase', 'Overall', 'Heavy', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'straight-to-video', 'movies', 'story', 'writing', 'were', 'let', 'down', 'Give', 'one', 'rent', 'even', 'consider', 'buying']",N/A

1383786,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0042XPF74,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","This is another British organize crime movie. If you have watched these in the past, you know they do not follow the successful American formula. This movie has more plot and drama than action. There is no one dodging bullets, jumping on car roofs, or even a good chase scene. This movie has improved on past British models in that it incorporates a sound track relative to the movie. Our main character, Mitchell ""Boots"" Mason is an ex-con working as a debt collector for a crime boss. As the movie progresses, we discover he is not ""all bad"" as his occupation may suggest, but a realistic complex character. Early on he is looking at pictures of the family he lost while a Kate Bush cover song is playing in the background. As the movie goes along we discover more about Boots' past.The plot has the predictable British twists that are too easy to figure out, perhaps a statement about how British film makers view their audience. It is nice to know Christopher Lee is still alive, but his role is minor and he doesn't bite people in the neck anymore. The movie is a step in the right direction, but don't expect a fast paced action film. No sex, no nudity. F-bomb gets dropped, fingers get cut off, and a woman is punched.The box claims, ""no innocent bystander is safe as bullets fly"" is an exaggeration of the action and might, at a stretch, apply to one scene.",4,BRITISH DRAMA PLUS SOME ACTION,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,1365,"['British', 'organize', 'crime', 'movie', 'have', 'watched', 'past', 'know', 'do', 'not', 'follow', 'successful', 'American', 'formula', 'movie', 'more', 'plot', 'drama', 'action', 'one', 'dodging', 'bullets', 'jumping', 'car', 'roofs', 'even', 'good', 'chase', 'scene', 'movie', 'improved', 'past', 'British', 'models', 'sound', 'track', 'relative', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'Mitchell', 'Boots', 'Mason', 'ex-con', 'working', 'debt', 'collector', 'crime', 'boss', 'movie', 'discover', 'not', 'bad', 'occupation', 'may', 'suggest', 'realistic', 'complex', 'character', 'Early', 'looking', 'pictures', 'family', 'lost', 'Kate', 'Bush', 'cover', 'song', 'playing', 'background', 'movie', 'discover', 'more', 'Boots', 'past.The', 'plot', 'predictable', 'British', 'twists', 'are', 'too', 'easy', 'figure', 'out', 'perhaps', 'statement', 'how', 'British', 'film', 'makers', 'view', 'audience', 'nice', 'know', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'still', 'alive', 'role', 'minor', ""n't"", 'bite', 'people', 'neck', 'anymore', 'movie', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'film', 'sex', 'nudity', 'F-bomb', 'dropped', 'fingers', 'get', 'cut', 'off', 'woman', 'punched.The', 'box', 'claims', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'safe', 'bullets', 'fly', 'exaggeration', 'action', 'might', 'stretch', 'apply', 'one', 'scene']",N/A
