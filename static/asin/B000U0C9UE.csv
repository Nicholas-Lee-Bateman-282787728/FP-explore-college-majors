According to my chiropractor, and Gary Kraftsow, the order in which the exercises are performed play a key part in helping certain areas of the body so while the moves may appear to be the same, they are in fact, working differently.I also opted for this series over the many yoga videos offered for its ""therapeutic"" possibilities. What I like about this series is that each movement is repeated several times, as one would expect, had they gone to a personal trainer or therapist. Movements aren't rushed and hurried, in order to accomplish some goal of showing off how many complicated yoga moves can be done in one hour, but are done with the intent of actually helping the body realign and heal itself.Another thing I like about the series is that it is very direct and to the point. There aren't any side jokes that will get annoying over time, there aren't any beginner comments made during the actual practices, and there is no background music.I can add my own music, via a CD or MP3 player, and change it up a bit so that I am not easily bored. When I forget why I should do a certain move, I can go back to the training section, and when I want to remember why these moves are important to my body, I can go to the ""Understanding"" section.

Gary Kraftsow's voice and instruction are very clear, understandable and unambiguous. There is no distracting music. The setting is pleasant with simplicity, not distracting or gimmicky. The people doing the movements follow Gary Kraftsow's cues along with the viewer at home. Their movements demonstrate what is being cued but they are not like choreographed ballet dancers or gymnasts; they are obviously experienced yoga practitioners but one can identify with them and thus be open to learning from their demonstrations. The pace is very good for allowing understanding of the movement and the breath. The practices are vigorous but when finished one is very relaxed and the areas of concentration (in this DVD it's the low back, sacrum and hips) feel relaxed and much improved, where there might have been problems before. This is becoming our favorite yoga practice and we recommend this viniyoga DVD most highly, as well as Gary Kraftsow's other viniyoga DVD for shoulders, upper back and neck - also excellent.

1093087,A30638B9S2GOM8,B000U0C9UE,apples2apples,"[107, 122]","I bought this DVD in 2008, and have tried it from time to time as my physical circumstances have changed. I bought this based on the wonderful reviews, and the fact that it was therapy for the low back, sacrum, and hips. I was in 2 bad car accidents in my 20's, and fractured my spine 6 years ago when I wiped out after hitting a patch of wet mud while biking. The result, after I'd healed enough to move around, was that I was left with considerable chronic pain in my lower back, and if I walk for any time at all, my hips get very painful. Prior to the accident I walked 7 miles per day, and rode my bike 10. Afterwards, I found myself unable to do any real exercise at all - not wanting to let my physical condition continue to deteriorate, I was looking for a gentle form of exercise.Some forms of yoga have been great when I was in good shape, so I thought I'd give Viniyoga a try 6 months after the accident. What I found was that it caused me more pain in my lower back, and I felt as though my muscles went into spasm that lasted quite a long time. Instead of opening up my hips or pelvis area, I felt more locked up. I do have to say that if my injuries hadn't been as severe, this DVD has real potential - so I'll keep it, hoping I'll get to the point where I can use it.A little more than a year after the accident, and some physical therapy behind me, I tried again. This time I still found my back hurt while doing the workout, esp the exercises done while lying on my back. I've decided to wait awhile, try a little more therapy before doing Viniyoga. I also had my physical therapist look at the video, and he felt it was good, and well worth hanging onto for use further down the road.I definately don't want to give up on this program because I do think it's a very good program, but I did want to review this for people who might find themselves in a similar position. Both to let them know it's a good program, and not to give up if it's painful at first.What this program offers which others I've looked at don't, is a really good understanding of how yoga can be utilized to stregthen the back, and get it back in condition. An excellent presentation on how to perform the various postures. And then the postures/exercises are broken down into different segments based on the areas one might need to concentrate on the most. For example, after so much time w/o any significant exercise, I very much need to stregthen my core, especially my lower abdomen, and all of my back muscles. When I exercise my back now it goes into spasm - which is pretty excrutiating - ever get a foot cramp? LOL Imagine that in your back, and I can't get out of it myself! Yikes it hurts!Anyway, I know this is a DVD I'll hang on to until I can do exercises w/o inducing more pain. And, until then, I wanted to suggest an alternative for those who find themselves in the same position I'm in, as well as those who would like an excellent core training DVD - the only one I've found that I can do at this point. It was suggested by a friend who's a pilates instructor, and it's the one DVD I'm finding offers significant healing from my injury. It's called Core Training for Belly Dancers by Gerson Kuhr ... he goes by another name based on a show he was in, but it escapes me at present - you can ck out the link if you're interested.Core Training for Belly DancersI've been using it now for a little over 2 months, and I can feel the improvement in my abdominal muscles - which I know are imperitive to a strong back. I can also feel improvement in my back - lower back in particular.

1093088,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000U0C9UE,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[130, 145]","This DVD focuses on issues of the lower body, specifically the lower back, hips, and sacrum (the other DVD in this series focuses on the upper body).  It differs from other yoga media offerings in that it contains a strong educational component in addition to the practice element.  Also, the practices offered on the DVD are designed for rehabilitation and strengthening, and thus they are more similar in feel to a physical therapy session than to a yoga class.The main menu of this DVD consists of four separate segments:  1) Understanding Back Pain, 2) Technique Workshop, 3) Therapeutic Practices, and 4) Special Features.  The Technique Workshop provides the opportunity to study individual postures in greater depth.  The Viniyoga Therapeutic Practices offer three complete practice segments tailored to meet different needs as described below.  (Note: the DVD also provides bonus MP3 audio versions of each practice.)1. Lower Back Therapy (23 minutes).  Gary recommends that you begin here, as this is the most gentle practice.  The postures are performed entirely on the floor and provide very mild stretching of the lower back area.2. Hip Therapy (31 minutes).  This practice, while still gentle and centered on floor postures, focuses more on the hips.  Unlike more traditional hip-opening sequences found in other yoga practices, the goal here is to stretch the hips from four perspectives (front, back, and each side).3. Strength and Stability (32 minutes).  This practice is the only one on the DVD to contain standing postures, and thus the intensity level is slightly higher than the other two.  Gary notes that it is designed to build long-term health and fitness in the low back, sacrum, and hips.The practices feature a single student working on a mat against a rather sparse white set, with Gary providing instruction via voiceover.  Most people are likely to find the practices rather dry--Gary's voice is a big monotone and repetitive, and there's little ""fun factor"" here.  However, these are therapeutic in nature, and as such, they are quite effective.  Although I personally didn't get much out of the first two practices--mainly because the low back and hips aren't a problem area for me--I was pleasantly surprised by the third, as it nicely stretched out not only my lower back but also my upper back, shoulders, and entire torso.  This DVD would be useful for virtually anyone who is at risk for lower back issues, from those who work at physical labor to those with more chronic conditions.  I definitely recommend Viniyoga Therapy for Lower Back, Hips, and Sacrum as an excellent tool for alleviating pain and promoting health in the entire lower back area.",5,Excellent yoga video for increasing mobility in the lower back and hips,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,2689,"['DVD', 'issues', 'lower', 'body', 'specifically', 'lower', 'back', 'hips', 'sacrum', 'other', 'DVD', 'series', 'upper', 'body', 'other', 'yoga', 'media', 'offerings', 'strong', 'educational', 'component', 'addition', 'practice', 'element', 'Also', 'practices', 'offered', 'DVD', 'are', 'designed', 'rehabilitation', 'strengthening', 'thus', 'are', 'more', 'similar', 'feel', 'physical', 'therapy', 'session', 'yoga', 'class.The', 'main', 'menu', 'DVD', 'four', 'separate', 'segments', '1', 'Understanding', 'Back', 'Pain', '2', 'Technique', 'Workshop', '3', 'Therapeutic', 'Practices', '4', 'Special', 'Features', 'Technique', 'Workshop', 'opportunity', 'study', 'individual', 'postures', 'greater', 'depth', 'Viniyoga', 'Therapeutic', 'Practices', 'offer', 'three', 'complete', 'practice', 'segments', 'tailored', 'meet', 'different', 'needs', 'described', 'Note', 'DVD', 'also', 'bonus', 'MP3', 'audio', 'versions', 'practice.', '1', 'Lower', 'Back', 'Therapy', '23', 'minutes', 'Gary', 'begin', 'here', 'most', 'gentle', 'practice', 'postures', 'are', 'performed', 'entirely', 'floor', 'provide', 'very', 'mild', 'stretching', 'lower', 'back', 'area.2', 'Hip', 'Therapy', '31', 'minutes', 'practice', 'still', 'gentle', 'centered', 'floor', 'postures', 'more', 'hips', 'more', 'traditional', 'hip-opening', 'sequences', 'found', 'other', 'yoga', 'practices', 'goal', 'here', 'stretch', 'hips', 'four', 'perspectives', 'front', 'back', 'side', '.3', 'Strength', 'Stability', '32', 'minutes', 'practice', 'only', 'one', 'DVD', 'contain', 'standing', 'postures', 'thus', 'intensity', 'level', 'slightly', 'higher', 'other', 'two', 'Gary', 'notes', 'designed', 'build', 'long-term', 'health', 'fitness', 'low', 'back', 'sacrum', 'hips.The', 'practices', 'feature', 'single', 'student', 'working', 'mat', 'rather', 'sparse', 'white', 'set', 'Gary', 'providing', 'instruction', 'voiceover', 'Most', 'people', 'are', 'likely', 'find', 'practices', 'rather', 'dry', 'Gary', 'voice', 'big', 'monotone', 'repetitive', 'little', 'fun', 'factor', 'here', 'However', 'are', 'therapeutic', 'nature', 'such', 'are', 'quite', 'effective', 'personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'first', 'two', 'practices', 'mainly', 'low', 'back', 'hips', 'are', ""n't"", 'problem', 'area', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'third', 'nicely', 'stretched', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'lower', 'back', 'also', 'upper', 'back', 'shoulders', 'entire', 'torso', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'useful', 'virtually', 'anyone', 'who', 'risk', 'lower', 'back', 'issues', 'who', 'work', 'physical', 'labor', 'more', 'chronic', 'conditions', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Viniyoga', 'Therapy', 'Lower', 'Back', 'Hips', 'Sacrum', 'excellent', 'tool', 'alleviating', 'pain', 'promoting', 'health', 'entire', 'lower', 'back', 'area']","Viniyoga Therapy for the Low Back, Sacrum & Hips with Gary Kraftsow"

1093096,A2AC3VJPUZS42C,B000U0C9UE,Jenny G,"[19, 28]","I'm not a yoga follower but was simply looking for a DVD to help with lower back and hip pain.  I have a posterior innominate rotation on the left (diagnosed in 1997) and hip dysplasia on the right. I also recently started physical therapy for knee pain (suluxated patellas - worse on the left), as well as the other issues.  In the past, a mix of back extension work and abs had really helped with my hip pain, but was not sufficient this time around.  So, based on reviews, I purchased this DVD. I have only used the first lower back routine on the DVD.Before I get into the review, I just want to add a caution for those that are not currently doing yoga, even if you are doing other Core exercises, you may want to break the workouts into sections.  The first time I did the lower back routine I did the entire segment and was rewarded about an hour later with intense pain accross both hips and lower back that lasted for several days.  This did not impact my review of the DVD, though, as I figured it was just too much, too soon.  So, after that I initially did the first half of this practice and then slowly added on through to the end.When my knee problems started I purchased this DVD and a knee DVD to see if I could improve the situation on my own.  I made a lot of progress but then over vacation re-injured my knee so started on physical therapy.  I continued to do the exercises from this DVD during my first 6 weeks of PT.  I did have some improvements in my lower back pain and stiffness, but this did nothing to help stabilize my rotation.  Also, as mentioned in a previous review, there is quite a bit in this DVD to bother the knees.  After re-injuring my knee I was forced to drop all Bridge exercises from this routine (oddly enough I can do a bridge with my feet on a chair and now do a single leg version of these).  Also, I ended up dropping the Supta Padangusthasana as the bending and straightening of the knee was also a problem, and to be honest it only provided a very weak hamstring stretch. If it were only the problems with my knees, I would probably have given the DVD a better score, but even when doing the full version of the workout it didn't provide any stability and only helped my lower back a little.For stablizing my hips and lower back rotation, my physical therapy has taken me in a completely different direction than this DVD.  I found I was very weak in my gluteus medius so my physical therapy focused on that (clams with resistance, abductor leg lifts with ankle weights, leg circles), as well as moving to the single-legged version of the bridge on a chair. After a few weeks we also added forearm planks and side planks.  Also, I continue to do ab exercises and have increased the intensity (I love the Pure Core routine from the Core Fusion Pilates Plus DVD).  I have found that the combination of exercises from physical therapy and my own ab routines have done a lot more for me than this exercise DVD has.  I have viewed the other two routines on the DVD, and don't think that either would be as efficient as what I am doing now, and would hurt my knee. My rotation has now stablized and although I'm still working through issues with some hip pain, my lower back pain is gone.  I found I was getting more and more bored with the routine from this DVD, and I really didn't want to devote over 20 minutes for just my lower back and then still have to do glutes and abs, so decided to eliminate the DVD workout. I did take from it the 4 versions of back extensions from the three routines, making a note of the timing used for each.  I also continue to do cakravakasana variations.  I can complete my lower back routine each day in less than 5 minutes and so it fits better with all the other exercise I do.I realize that I have some specific issues so this impacts my review of the DVD, but regardless I think the routines are too long and don't include the abs and very little for the gluteus medius.  Also, just found it really boring after a while.  So, it's just not for me. I may pull it out from time to time for a lighter lower back workout as I did a few days ago, but I do not see this continuing as a daily practice. If you simply have problems with lower back pain/stiffness but no mechanical issues then this DVD would probably provide a perfect workout for you.",3,Not for me,1259366400,"11 28, 2009",2009,4330,"[""'m"", 'not', 'yoga', 'follower', 'was', 'simply', 'looking', 'DVD', 'help', 'lower', 'back', 'hip', 'pain', 'have', 'posterior', 'innominate', 'rotation', 'left', 'diagnosed', '1997', 'hip', 'dysplasia', 'right', 'also', 'recently', 'started', 'physical', 'therapy', 'knee', 'pain', 'suluxated', 'patellas', 'worse', 'left', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'issues', 'past', 'mix', 'back', 'extension', 'work', 'abs', 'had', 'really', 'helped', 'hip', 'pain', 'was', 'not', 'sufficient', 'time', 'around', 'So', 'based', 'reviews', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'have', 'only', 'used', 'first', 'lower', 'back', 'routine', 'DVD.Before', 'get', 'review', 'just', 'want', 'add', 'caution', 'are', 'not', 'currently', 'doing', 'yoga', 'even', 'are', 'doing', 'other', 'Core', 'exercises', 'may', 'want', 'break', 'workouts', 'sections', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'lower', 'back', 'routine', 'did', 'entire', 'segment', 'was', 'rewarded', 'hour', 'later', 'intense', 'pain', 'hips', 'lower', 'back', 'lasted', 'several', 'days', 'did', 'not', 'impact', 'review', 'DVD', 'though', 'figured', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'So', 'initially', 'did', 'first', 'half', 'practice', 'then', 'slowly', 'added', 'end.When', 'knee', 'problems', 'started', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'knee', 'DVD', 'see', 'could', 'improve', 'situation', 'own', 'made', 'lot', 'progress', 'then', 'vacation', 're-injured', 'knee', 'so', 'started', 'physical', 'therapy', 'continued', 'do', 'exercises', 'DVD', 'first', '6', 'weeks', 'PT', 'did', 'have', 'improvements', 'lower', 'back', 'pain', 'stiffness', 'did', 'nothing', 'help', 'stabilize', 'rotation', 'Also', 'mentioned', 'previous', 'review', 'quite', 'bit', 'DVD', 'bother', 'knees', 're-injuring', 'knee', 'was', 'forced', 'drop', 'Bridge', 'routine', 'oddly', 'enough', 'can', 'do', 'bridge', 'feet', 'chair', 'now', 'do', 'single', 'leg', 'version', 'Also', 'ended', 'up', 'dropping', 'Supta', 'Padangusthasana', 'bending', 'straightening', 'knee', 'was', 'also', 'problem', 'be', 'honest', 'only', 'provided', 'very', 'weak', 'hamstring', 'stretch', 'were', 'only', 'problems', 'knees', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'given', 'DVD', 'better', 'score', 'even', 'when', 'doing', 'full', 'version', 'workout', 'did', ""n't"", 'provide', 'stability', 'only', 'helped', 'lower', 'back', 'little.For', 'stablizing', 'hips', 'lower', 'back', 'rotation', 'physical', 'therapy', 'taken', 'completely', 'different', 'direction', 'DVD', 'found', 'was', 'very', 'weak', 'gluteus', 'medius', 'physical', 'therapy', 'focused', 'clams', 'resistance', 'abductor', 'leg', 'ankle', 'weights', 'leg', 'circles', 'as', 'well', 'moving', 'single-legged', 'version', 'bridge', 'chair', 'few', 'weeks', 'also', 'added', 'forearm', 'planks', 'side', 'planks', 'Also', 'continue', 'do', 'ab', 'exercises', 'have', 'increased', 'intensity', 'love', 'Pure', 'Core', 'routine', 'Core', 'Fusion', 'Pilates', 'Plus', 'DVD', 'have', 'found', 'combination', 'exercises', 'physical', 'therapy', 'own', 'ab', 'routines', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'more', 'exercise', 'DVD', 'have', 'viewed', 'other', 'two', 'routines', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'efficient', 'what', 'am', 'doing', 'now', 'would', 'hurt', 'knee', 'rotation', 'now', 'stablized', ""'m"", 'still', 'working', 'issues', 'hip', 'pain', 'lower', 'back', 'pain', 'gone', 'found', 'was', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'bored', 'routine', 'DVD', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'devote', '20', 'minutes', 'just', 'lower', 'back', 'then', 'still', 'have', 'do', 'glutes', 'abs', 'so', 'decided', 'eliminate', 'DVD', 'workout', 'did', 'take', '4', 'versions', 'back', 'extensions', 'three', 'routines', 'making', 'note', 'timing', 'used', 'also', 'continue', 'do', 'cakravakasana', 'variations', 'can', 'complete', 'lower', 'back', 'routine', 'day', 'less', '5', 'minutes', 'so', 'better', 'other', 'exercise', 'do.I', 'realize', 'have', 'specific', 'issues', 'impacts', 'review', 'DVD', 'regardless', 'think', 'routines', 'are', 'too', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'include', 'abs', 'very', 'little', 'gluteus', 'medius', 'Also', 'just', 'found', 'really', 'boring', 'while', 'So', 'just', 'not', 'may', 'pull', 'out', 'time', 'time', 'lighter', 'lower', 'back', 'did', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'continuing', 'daily', 'practice', 'simply', 'have', 'problems', 'lower', 'back', 'pain/stiffness', 'mechanical', 'issues', 'then', 'DVD', 'would', 'probably', 'provide', 'perfect', 'workout']","Viniyoga Therapy for the Low Back, Sacrum & Hips with Gary Kraftsow"

I wasn't looking for an instant cure!  Just a way for me to intake the knowledge of the viniyoga into my sacrum and lower back, let alone my hips, just as once I looked up at the low hanging French sky, on my back, in a crowded avenue, while my schoolbus shot off without me, and French boys were laughing at me through the still flapping backdoor of the bus, and my whole body irradiuated with pain.  Kraftsow isn't a comedian like so many other yoga ""entertainers"" and he seems to want to educate the viewer into going along with a slow-paced regimen, nothing flashy, just good old fashioned poses and a l-o-t of stretching of tight tendons.  Deep in the sacrum, where a bewildering variety of muscles come together in confusing interstitial junctions, the pain gremlins shriek in fright when they hear Gary Kraftsow's relaxing voice boom out changes with his trademark conviction.  The guy really believes in what he's doing, and when I'm watching this on my wide screen TV in my sunroom, I occasionally take a break and write him a little personal note of thanks, mailing it off to his atelier with name and address attached.

The usual diagnosis is a doctor's visit followed by a prescription of physical therapy.  A little expensive even with co-pay.  We decided to try this dvd since it raves about dealing with lower back pain: not only was it gentle and specific to the area of pain (you can choose one of three sections to work on - lower back, hips and strength training,  All fully explained with another section showing you techniques if you are not familiar with yoga type moves.  Gary Kraftsow also spends 20+ minutes going over causes of back pain, it is not a substitute to a doctor's visit, but self education goes a long way.  We supplement this dvd with some physical therapy sessions (to tell you the truth - there is not much difference in the exercises).  This dvd also provides an aftercare in that you can continue to work at home at your own leisure to strengthen your back and hips.this dvd is appropriate for most ages, but beware that you should not go into the full movement if you start feeling pain!

Determine if any of the exercises might hurt you or if you need to modify. While modifications are not given, you can figure out your own. Moreover, there are few stretches here (and I call them that because they're not at all strenuous) that would be hard for too many people. Certainly some of us, myself included, can't put our legs straight up with no bend in the knee. But we must go only to our own degree. Never push beyond what you're able to do. You get no benefit doing that.These are short therapeutic exercises --- from twenty to thirty minutes each. They provide much relief from pain and are designed in a manner that works. What's more, there is a lot of information given on the DVD, including instructions on how to do each exercise. I advise you to watch every bit of it.I have a wonderful book on the anatomy of stretching and it includes working on the lower back and hips. You might want to read about it hereStretching Anatomy. And you might want to add it to your arsenal of help. But, getting back to this DVD, I find that while it doesn't cover all the stretches in the above-mentioned book, it is a wonderful way to relieve any pain you may have, regardless of how bad it might be. Moreover, if you don't do something to work on those painful areas, you could end up not being able to get around at all.I was having moderate to severe pain in my lower back and hip and this DVD was of tremendous help to me.I highly advise anyone with problems or pain in the lower back or hips to get this DVD. It's excellent therapy that anyone can apply and it's superior to most of the yoga videos I've seen.- Susanna K.

I had pain to some degree every day of my life, worse when I had a sedentary job.  When I started practicing yoga in my late 40s on a regular basis, my left low back pain started to noticeably improve.  The Viniyoga DVDs from this manufacturer are wonderful for people who suffer from spinal pain.  They are done by physical therapists and are very professional.  They work at both stretching and strengthening the spine.  I would say the poses range from beginning to beginning/intermediate on this DVD.  I wish my brother would invest in these because he's also had a back problem since an injury in his 20s.  The reason I didn't rate it as a 5 is because they are a bit on the boring side and don't have any music like my favoriate instructor's DVDs (Rodney Yee).",4,"Solid, therapeutic DVD",1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,843,"['injured', 'left', 'low', 'back', '1987', 'have', 'had', 'problem', 'ever', 'had', 'pain', 'degree', 'day', 'life', 'worse', 'when', 'had', 'sedentary', 'job', 'When', 'started', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'late', '40s', 'regular', 'basis', 'left', 'low', 'back', 'pain', 'started', 'noticeably', 'improve', 'Viniyoga', 'DVDs', 'manufacturer', 'are', 'wonderful', 'people', 'who', 'suffer', 'spinal', 'pain', 'are', 'done', 'physical', 'therapists', 'are', 'very', 'professional', 'work', 'stretching', 'strengthening', 'spine', 'would', 'say', 'poses', 'range', 'beginning', 'beginning/intermediate', 'DVD', 'wish', 'brother', 'would', 'invest', 'also', 'had', 'back', 'problem', 'injury', '20s', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'rate', '5', 'are', 'bit', 'boring', 'side', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'music', 'favoriate', 'instructor', 'DVDs', 'Rodney', 'Yee']","Viniyoga Therapy for the Low Back, Sacrum & Hips with Gary Kraftsow"

Don't have to worrya bout any of those things with this DVD.  I bought it a month ago, to help with pain my lower back - to help strenghten that area without feeling like I'd been run over by a truck when I was done.  This DVD not only helps center on that specific area of the lower back (etc) but does it slowly, simply and without any unnessary distractions like music or seagulls in the background.Kraftsow's voice is easy to listen to and although some may find it boring, it reminds me alot of the late Bob Ross - you know that painter guy who used to paint happy little squirrels in happy little trees? - that type of soothing and relaxing tone.  And his easy going style and slow take on the positions is extremely helpful to someone like me who can't jump from one pose to another in 1.5 nano seconds.I've mostly done the first video on the disc, the 22 minute one. It's the least taxing, but you still get what you need out of the routine.  This particular routine is also the perfect jumping off point for anyone starting Yoga for the first time and for those with back issues who want to begin slowly.I also appreciate that all 3 videos are not over-long.  These aren't 40-60 minute routines where you just keep thinking that you can't wait for it to be over.  Short and sweet and I'm pretty sure it's helping me feel stronger and less pain in the lower back. If nothing else, it's forcing me to work muscles that probably haven't recieved enough attention over my 41 years.  And that can only be a good thing.I still will never be able to push my body into pretzel formation, but simple basic moves help make this DVD a must have for me.",5,"Simple, but helpful",1378512000,"09 7, 2013",2013,1774,"['do', ""n't"", 'do', 'Yoga', ""'ve"", 'not', 'good', 'difficult', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'pulling', 'body', 'shape', 'pretzel', 'Do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worrya', 'things', 'DVD', 'bought', 'month', 'ago', 'help', 'pain', 'lower', 'back', 'help', 'strenghten', 'area', 'feeling', ""'d"", 'been', 'run', 'over', 'truck', 'when', 'was', 'done', 'DVD', 'not', 'only', 'center', 'specific', 'area', 'lower', 'back', 'etc', 'slowly', 'simply', 'unnessary', 'distractions', 'music', 'seagulls', 'background.Kraftsow', 'voice', 'easy', 'listen', 'may', 'find', 'boring', 'alot', 'late', 'Bob', 'Ross', 'know', 'painter', 'guy', 'who', 'used', 'paint', 'happy', 'little', 'squirrels', 'happy', 'little', 'trees', 'type', 'soothing', 'relaxing', 'tone', 'easy', 'going', 'style', 'slow', 'take', 'positions', 'extremely', 'helpful', 'someone', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'jump', 'one', 'pose', '1.5', 'nano', 'seconds.I', ""'ve"", 'mostly', 'done', 'first', 'video', 'disc', '22', 'minute', 'one', 'least', 'taxing', 'still', 'get', 'what', 'need', 'routine', 'particular', 'routine', 'also', 'perfect', 'jumping', 'off', 'point', 'anyone', 'starting', 'Yoga', 'first', 'time', 'back', 'issues', 'who', 'want', 'begin', 'slowly.I', 'also', 'appreciate', '3', 'videos', 'are', 'not', 'over-long', 'are', ""n't"", '40-60', 'minute', 'routines', 'where', 'just', 'keep', 'thinking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'be', 'Short', 'sweet', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'helping', 'feel', 'stronger', 'less', 'pain', 'lower', 'back', 'nothing', 'else', 'forcing', 'work', 'muscles', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'recieved', 'enough', 'attention', '41', 'years', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'good', 'thing.I', 'still', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'push', 'body', 'pretzel', 'formation', 'simple', 'basic', 'moves', 'help', 'make', 'DVD', 'must', 'have']","Viniyoga Therapy for the Low Back, Sacrum & Hips with Gary Kraftsow"
