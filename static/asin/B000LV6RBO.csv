1040806,ACTS6G5MMQMY5,B000LV6RBO,"Angel F. Kincaid ""angel""","[0, 0]","HI there again!It's me Angel, the barbie dealer and collector.Here again to rate another barbie item.So I bet you are wondering about the title of my review right?Well The explaination is this.While typically most of the barbie movies out there are for and what would be considered kids movies, I found this one to be special.The story of this movie is the Fairy Elina goes off to school to learn how to do magic. When she gets there she meets people and class mates and has to work and learn with these folks in order to learn her magic, perform the ""Flight of Spring"" and keep the land from falling into winter for ten years.There is of course the evil bad guy, and the saving the day. Not to mention the beautiful visuals and the excellent animation and voice acting.That however is not what makes this film what it is. What makes this flim one of the best of this series is this. While Elina is working to learn her skills, she meets the people we have all met in our life time, usually in highschool. The snobs, the jerks, the self centered creitins that can wear you down to an emotional nub.This film is about first, over coming that. Learning to not listen to the people around you that make fun of you and try to bring you down. Then learning to over come the haters that you meet and maintaining your own self worth.Thats the real point of this film, understanding and likeing your self. Listening to your own values and not letting others ruin your world because of thier H...bent natures.So its a good movie for the young girls in your life to watch, to show them that when the time comes and they put up with this treatment, to not let it get to them. But its also a good movie for anyone to watch who as I said, has ever made it out of highschool alive.cheers.Angel.",5,For anyone who has ever made it out of highschool alive...,1215561600,"07 9, 2008",2008,1780,"['HI', 'again', 'Angel', 'barbie', 'dealer', 'collector.Here', 'again', 'rate', 'barbie', 'item.So', 'bet', 'are', 'wondering', 'title', 'review', 'right', 'Well', 'explaination', 'this.While', 'typically', 'most', 'barbie', 'movies', 'are', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'kids', 'movies', 'found', 'one', 'be', 'special.The', 'story', 'movie', 'Fairy', 'Elina', 'school', 'learn', 'how', 'do', 'magic', 'When', 'there', 'people', 'class', 'mates', 'work', 'learn', 'folks', 'order', 'learn', 'magic', 'perform', 'Flight', 'Spring', 'keep', 'land', 'falling', 'winter', 'ten', 'course', 'evil', 'bad', 'guy', 'saving', 'day', 'Not', 'mention', 'beautiful', 'visuals', 'excellent', 'animation', 'voice', 'acting.That', 'however', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'what', 'What', 'flim', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'Elina', 'working', 'learn', 'skills', 'people', 'have', 'met', 'life', 'time', 'usually', 'highschool', 'snobs', 'jerks', 'self', 'centered', 'creitins', 'can', 'wear', 'down', 'emotional', 'nub.This', 'film', 'first', 'coming', 'Learning', 'not', 'listen', 'people', 'make', 'fun', 'try', 'bring', 'down', 'Then', 'learning', 'come', 'haters', 'meet', 'maintaining', 'own', 'self', 'real', 'point', 'film', 'understanding', 'likeing', 'self', 'Listening', 'own', 'values', 'not', 'letting', 'others', 'ruin', 'world', 'thier', 'H', 'bent', 'good', 'movie', 'young', 'girls', 'life', 'watch', 'show', 'when', 'time', 'put', 'up', 'treatment', 'not', 'let', 'get', 'also', 'good', 'movie', 'anyone', 'watch', 'who', 'said', 'ever', 'made', 'highschool', 'alive.cheers.Angel']",N/A

1040827,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B000LV6RBO,Marshall Lord,"[8, 10]","Compared with some of the other Barbie videos I was slightly disappointed with this, but the target audience certainly were not. In the week we rented this film I have lost count of the number of times my children have watched it.For reference, this is the third in the ""Fairytopia"" sequence which currently consists of:FairytopiaMermaidiaMagic of the Rainbow.Before we first rented one of the Barbie videos for my daughter, I was expecting them to be trite, over-commercialised, and over-sugary. In general, however, I have been pleasantly surprised.Yes, they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccharine count, but the quality of the Barbie films we have subsequently bought or rented, including all three ""Fairytopia"" films, was significantly higher than I had originally expected. They have not just kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - but introduced them to some beautiful stories. Several - but sadly not this one - also introduced my children to some truly wonderful music.On more than one occasion I have been listening to a CD of a classic such as Beethoven's pastoral symphony, or ""The Queen of the Night's aria"" from Mozart's opera ""The Magic Flute"", and my five year old daughter has recognised and expressed appreciation of the music, and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it. (""Magic of Pegasus"" and ""Mermaidia"" respectively.)So I was very disappointed that ""Fairytopia - the magic of the rainbow"" did not continue this tradition: no great classics this time, the musical score is just competently written filler.The film continues the story of a Barbie as a good fairy, Elina and her ""puffball"" companion Bibble, who seek to protect the land of the fairies (Fairytopia) from being taken over and ruined by the evil Laverna.This time Bibble, the ""puffball"" comic relief character gets a romance of his own.Those people who enjoy criticising the way Mattel operate the Barbie franchise will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then this film and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them.The female characters are all on the thin side of plausibility: I'm not worried that watching this is going to give my own daughter anorexia as she likes food too much and has a good sense of the difference between fantasy and reality. And after all, the characters in this story are fairies, complete with wings! However, if you are worried that your children may be forming an unrealistic idea about how thin a healthy female body shape is, it is not quite impossible that this film may contribute to it.But on the plus side: it is beautifully made, it will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour's rest after doing so. And there are still a few more sophisticated jokes thrown in, so you won't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch it with your offspring.Overall this is not, in my opinion, quite as good as some of the previous Barbie videos, including the first two Fairytopia"" titles, but anything which can hold my children's attention as well as this film did clearly has something going for it.Having rented the title to try it out, I will be buying it for my children, probably as part of the triple DVD set with all three ""Fairytopia"" titles.",4,Not the best for adults but a huge hit with small children,1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,3507,"['Compared', 'other', 'Barbie', 'videos', 'was', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'target', 'audience', 'certainly', 'were', 'not', 'week', 'rented', 'film', 'have', 'lost', 'count', 'number', 'times', 'children', 'have', 'watched', 'it.For', 'reference', 'third', 'Fairytopia', 'sequence', 'currently', 'FairytopiaMermaidiaMagic', 'Rainbow.Before', 'first', 'rented', 'one', 'Barbie', 'videos', 'daughter', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'trite', 'over-commercialised', 'over-sugary', 'general', 'however', 'have', 'been', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.Yes', 'do', 'have', 'lot', 'commercial', 'spin-offs', 'high', 'saccharine', 'count', 'quality', 'Barbie', 'films', 'have', 'subsequently', 'bought', 'rented', 'including', 'three', 'Fairytopia', 'films', 'was', 'significantly', 'higher', 'had', 'originally', 'expected', 'have', 'not', 'just', 'kept', 'children', 'engrossed', 'hours', 'including', 'son', 'as', 'well', 'daughter', 'introduced', 'beautiful', 'stories', 'Several', 'sadly', 'not', 'one', 'also', 'introduced', 'children', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'music.On', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'have', 'been', 'listening', 'CD', 'classic', 'such', 'Beethoven', 'pastoral', 'symphony', 'Queen', 'Night', 'aria', 'Mozart', 'opera', 'Magic', 'Flute', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'recognised', 'expressed', 'appreciation', 'music', 'correctly', 'remembered', 'Barbie', 'film', 'had', 'used', 'Magic', 'Pegasus', 'Mermaidia', 'respectively', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'Fairytopia', 'magic', 'rainbow', 'did', 'not', 'continue', 'tradition', 'great', 'classics', 'time', 'musical', 'score', 'just', 'competently', 'written', 'filler.The', 'film', 'story', 'Barbie', 'good', 'fairy', 'Elina', 'puffball', 'companion', 'Bibble', 'who', 'seek', 'protect', 'land', 'fairies', 'Fairytopia', 'being', 'taken', 'ruined', 'evil', 'Laverna.This', 'time', 'Bibble', 'puffball', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'romance', 'own.Those', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'criticising', 'way', 'Mattel', 'operate', 'Barbie', 'franchise', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'things', 'production', 'sneer', 'more', 'importantly', 'kids', 'are', 'allergic', 'excess', 'twee', 'sweetness', 'then', 'film', 'Barbie', 'videos', 'generally', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'them.The', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'thin', 'side', 'plausibility', ""'m"", 'not', 'worried', 'watching', 'going', 'give', 'own', 'daughter', 'anorexia', 'food', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'sense', 'difference', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'fairies', 'complete', 'wings', 'However', 'are', 'worried', 'children', 'may', 'be', 'forming', 'unrealistic', 'idea', 'how', 'thin', 'healthy', 'female', 'body', 'shape', 'not', 'quite', 'impossible', 'film', 'may', 'contribute', 'it.But', 'plus', 'side', 'beautifully', 'made', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'most', 'small', 'children', 'long', 'enough', 'typical', 'exhausted', 'parent', 'clear', 'mess', 'have', 'made', 'several', 'rooms', 'house', 'collapse', 'hour', 'rest', 'doing', 'so', 'are', 'still', 'few', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'jokes', 'thrown', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'completely', 'bored', 'death', 'decide', 'watch', 'offspring.Overall', 'not', 'opinion', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'Barbie', 'videos', 'including', 'first', 'two', 'Fairytopia', 'titles', 'anything', 'can', 'hold', 'children', 'attention', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'did', 'clearly', 'something', 'going', 'it.Having', 'rented', 'title', 'try', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'children', 'probably', 'part', 'triple', 'DVD', 'set', 'three', 'Fairytopia', 'titles']",N/A

The way they tried to throw in hip, modern phrases grated on me. (""fairy school"" ""dorms""for example.)It just lacked the simplicity, charm, and another-world fantasy that the other two did. Fairytopia and Mermaidia portrayed living in a whole 'nother world that consisted of fantasy and fairies much better than this one. It's still good, but there's not as much adventure. It's more of a mystery movie...you know, ""what's going on, how's it happening, who's behind it?""

You can see them together, in order, or seperate and you can always follow along and figure out what is going on.  I have to say that if you are having doubts about Barbie in general, these films are wonderful for young girls.  Barbie is always polite, the music chosen for the movies is always classical and gloriously arranged, the lessons are timeless as well.  We need more movies like these for young people, as I think we are far too modern for our own good sometimes.  Every movie you see, even cartoons, have such pounding, fast paced music and storylines it almost can make your head spin.  These stories are classic and timeless, I also recommend Barbie's other films, The 12 Dancing Princesses, Swan Lake and Rapunzel.  Stories of friendship, loyalty and caring that will be sure to teach your little ones the things they will need to grow to be positive role models themselves someday.",4,Barbie fans will love it!,1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,1002,"['have', 'say', 'film', 'trilogy', 'Fairytopia', 'Mermadia', 'now', 'Magic', 'Rainbow', 'are', 'wonderful', 'can', 'see', 'together', 'order', 'seperate', 'can', 'always', 'follow', 'along', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'have', 'say', 'are', 'having', 'doubts', 'Barbie', 'general', 'films', 'are', 'wonderful', 'young', 'girls', 'Barbie', 'always', 'polite', 'music', 'chosen', 'movies', 'always', 'classical', 'gloriously', 'arranged', 'lessons', 'are', 'timeless', 'well', 'need', 'more', 'movies', 'young', 'people', 'think', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'modern', 'own', 'good', 'sometimes', 'Every', 'movie', 'see', 'even', 'cartoons', 'have', 'such', 'pounding', 'fast', 'paced', 'music', 'storylines', 'almost', 'can', 'make', 'head', 'spin', 'stories', 'are', 'classic', 'timeless', 'also', 'recommend', 'Barbie', 'other', 'films', '12', 'Dancing', 'Princesses', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'Rapunzel', 'Stories', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'caring', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'teach', 'little', 'ones', 'things', 'will', 'need', 'grow', 'be', 'positive', 'role', 'models', 'someday']",N/A
