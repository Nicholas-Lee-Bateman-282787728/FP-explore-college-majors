Albert Brooks is hilariousin  &#34;defending his life&#34;  when put in front of a panel of judges to determine if he's worthy of going forward or being sent back. Meryl Streep is also &#34;defending her life&#34; and the two meet.  It will have you grinning ear to ear.Bridges of Madison County is another one of Streep's great movie roles.
