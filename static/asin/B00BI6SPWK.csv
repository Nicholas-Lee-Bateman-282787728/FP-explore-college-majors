Much funnier than that Lampinelli chick and much easier on the eyes ....for those who have been with Sommore since Day 1, then you won't be disappointed at all! She's back with something for the mature, grown-up crowd. I laughed the entire set. Definitely worth the money and time.",4,Wonderful...definitely Rated MA,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,421,"['Great', ""'re"", 'just', 'picking', 'up', 'Sommore', 'commediene', 'definitely', 'need', 'open', 'mind', 'ballsy', 'outspoken', 'very', 'underrated', 'Much', 'funnier', 'Lampinelli', 'chick', 'much', 'easier', 'eyes', '.for', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'Sommore', 'Day', '1', 'then', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'back', 'something', 'mature', 'grown-up', 'crowd', 'laughed', 'entire', 'set', 'Definitely', 'money', 'time']",Sommore - Chandelier Status
1634819,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00BI6SPWK,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 5]","Straight talking comedienne Sommore makes a welcome return with the 2013 Showtime Comedy Concert ""Chandelier Status.""  I hadn't seen much of Sommore lately, so I was happy to have the opportunity to catch up with her.  Her real break-out was the immensely popular ""Queens of Comedy"" tour in 2000 that showcased her unique brand of biting commentary.  As part of a quartet of funny ladies (Mo'Nique, Adele Givens, and Laura Hayes were the others), she was fresh out of jail and ready to serve up her bawdy world view.  It wasn't until 2007 that she unveiled her first full length concert tour with ""The Queen Stands Alone"" and its subsequent Comedy Central Special and DVD have become wildly popular.  Since then, she has been a part of other comedy ensembles (Royal Comedy Tour), but ""Chandelier Status"" again puts Sommore front and center as the headliner of her own show.  Filmed before an enthusiastic Miami audience, Sommore is older and wiser and ready to dish.An easy recommendation for fans, this set is a blend of the old with the new.  As things started out, I was a bit worried that she had lost some of her edge.  Certain jokes (bootlegging movies, for example) seemed downright antiquated.  Perhaps not as funny as some of her earlier material, Sommore still has a strong viewpoint.  Relating mostly to her status as an African American woman, her observational brand of humor is more hilarious the closer it strikes to her own life.  Speaking about relationships or even men versus women in general, she gets downright nasty and it's easily the best part of the show.  The more personal, the more in-your-face, the better her confrontational style comes across.  The set gets stronger as it progresses and there were a few moments of ""did she really say that?""This DVD release has the concert which runs approximately 76 minutes.  The lone Bonus Feature is a brief question and answer period which is fine, but isn't a huge selling point either.  This might not be Sommore's best performance to date, but it's just good to see her again.  Definitely for fans.  If you don't know Sommore, I'd check out her earlier concerts first as each one of the DVD releases represent her at a different point in her life.
