Each scene had the potential to be funny, but it just wasn't.My guess is that the original script was funny, but something happened in the directing, acting, and final edits that just went sour.It could be another case of delusions of grandeur where the makers of this film were so sure it was funny that they went into it over confident and forgot to get feedback on each scene after it was shot, to go back and edit it.  As I said, each scene should have been funny, but the delivery made it awkward, uncomfortable, and something you groan at, not laugh at.  It was a huge disappointment.  Towards the end of the film, they just take it way too far.  I don't want to give away spoilers but there's no way the main character would respond to the other main character the way he does, warm and tolerant at the end.  The crazy guy tries really hard to ruin his life, and it ends with them good friends because of all they went through.  That made NO sense at all.  It seemed obvious to me that this was a result of a bad editing job.

1302750,A2582KMXLK2P06,B002ZG97II,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","Due Date is about two men who are polar opposites meeting up unintentionally at an airport and gradually becoming friends.  The one man is ultra uptight and serious while the other guy has a couple loose screws and is just a plain goofball who appears to be uncertain about what exactly he wants in life.Together, they go on a cross country road trip.  The purpose of this trip?  Well there appears to be two reasons.  One, the goofy guy wants to find an appropriate place to dump his fathers ashes, and the serious guy wants to get home to his pregnant wife in time for the birth of their baby.For the most part, the strength of Due Date lies almost entirely in the way the two men try to communicate with each other and accept each others *drastically* different perspective of the world.  It's a challenge for sure!  While travelling across the country, the two men find themselves in several different interesting situations.  My favorite is when the two men arrive to a house where a woman likes listening to the rock band Cream and doing drugs, while her kids have fun picking on the serious guy in the living room.  It's funny because the serious guy shouldn't even BE there in the first place!Pretty soon however, viewers will begin to realize there's not much of a plot taking place.  It's just one silly segment leading directly into another one, and that's about the gist of what you can expect with Due Date.  Overall, funny at times, though sometimes the silliness reaches a level of absurdity that's just plain pointless and makes you wonder if you really want to see this movie to its conclusion.

1302758,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG97II,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 3]","At the start of ""Due Date,"" Robert Downey, Jr.'s character leaves a message on his pregnant wife's cell phone. He describes a dream he had, one in which a bear chews through his child's umbilical cord immediately after the birth. By the end of the film, he becomes convinced that the dream was prophetic. I became convinced he was deluding himself - or, more accurately, the filmmakers were deluding themselves into believing they had actually pulled off a display of twisted symbolism. The only thing they pull off is an act of desperate contrivance, which comes in the form of an oddity played by Zach Galifianakis. No, not a character. An oddity. When the moment comes and the dream is interpreted, I sank in my seat, realizing that I had endured nearly 100 minutes of lowbrow humor for nothing. There's no payoff, apart from more oddness.""Due Date"" is directed by Todd Phillips, who a year ago helmed ""The Hangover"" to tremendous box office and critical acclaim. I admit that the film never appealed to my sense of humor, but at least it had an engaging story. Not only does ""Due Date"" suffer from a plot that's neither original nor interesting, it's also a nonstop barrage of unappealing physical and verbal gags. Many of these are given to Galifianakis, whose character doesn't even work within the context of a vulgar road trip buddy comedy; he's a bizarre goofball caricature that plays on one note - a man defined solely by flat, tiresome, scene-killing quirks. He's so thoroughly off-putting, it's impossible to believe anyone could grow to love him as a friend. In real life, a man like this would be committed to a sanitarium and forced to undergo extensive psychological testing.Downey plays Los Angeles architect Peter Highman, a father-to-be excited to fly home from Atlanta in time for his child's birth. As soon as he arrives at the airport, he crosses paths with the over-the-top Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis), who, as it turns out, is also on his way to Los Angeles. Specifically, he's on his way to Hollywood; he's an aspiring actor who dreams of making an appearance on ""Two and a Half Men."" An unlikely luggage mix-up forces both Peter and Ethan off the plane and onto a no-fly list. This forces Peter into hitching a ride with Ethan and his beloved pet dog, Sonny, in a rented car. Thus begins a madcap, disaster ridden cross-country journey, highlighted by such pleasant visuals as the dog masturbating, Peter getting beaten by a surly paraplegic veteran, and Peter punching a young boy in the chest. We're also treated to a run in with corrupt Mexican border-patrol officers, resulting in a car chase that miraculously resolves itself as soon as the scene ends.Ethan is developed on nothing other than his ability to drive Peter and everyone else he comes into contact with insane. He has no social skills. He's immature, pretty much to the point where it's obvious he has a mental disorder. He regularly smokes marijuana, which he claims is for glaucoma. He dresses like a bum who robbed a thrift store. He has a curious habit of asking incredibly stupid questions, saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, and spouting facts and figures that are wrong. He carries his father's ashes in a coffee can. He parades his dog around as if the poor little thing were actually a human friend. He's so utterly unlikable that I simply didn't buy the idea that Peter could ever come to accept him. Perhaps Galifianakis is qualified to play a role like this, but to be perfectly frank, I'm getting tired of seeing him play the same eccentric loony he has been playing pretty much his entire career.This leaves Downey. While playing the hapless straight man allowed me to like his character a lot more than Galifianakis', I'm wondering if that ultimately contributed to the film's unappealing tone. Comedy has thrived on mismatching (Laurel and Hardy, Abbot and Costello, Martin and Lewis), but here, it doesn't feel like a calculated move so much as an unfortunate misdirection. Downey and Galifianakis are so completely ill-fitting together that absolutely nothing they say or do registers as funny - it merely registers as awkward.The same can be said about the story, which draws in the audience not through a genuinely intriguing series of events but by appealing to our inner immature teenager. Crude movies can be hilariously enjoyable, but there has to be something more to it other than crudeness, if you get my meaning; there needs to be an engaging plot, good characters, and a clever screenplay. This movie falls short in every respect. Consider a brief subplot involving Jamie Foxx, who plays Peter's best friend. When Peter suspects him of something terrible, we expect it to be integral to the rest of the film. But it isn't. In fact, it's resolved almost as soon as it begins. That begs the question of why this particular subplot was included in the first place. I suspect it was only because it gave Downey and Foxx the chance to work together again following ""The Soloist."" ""Due Date"" tries and tries hard, but unfortunately, it just doesn't have what it takes to be a comedy classic.",3,Some Road Trips Are Better Left Untaken,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,5117,"['start',

But it did hold my interest and I laughed throughout.I actually enjoyed Robert Downey Jr. in this movie more than anything I've ever seen him in. I ""got""  his straight-laced attitude, his conflict, his character (in a way, I could have imagined the role being played by Hugh Laurie of House fame). Zach Galifianakis is an actor I'm not familiar with but he was funny too.The set-up is thus: Downey and Galifianakis are both strangers taking the same plane from LA to New York together, and through some unfortunate conversation they both end up getting kicked off the plane as suspected terrorists and put on a no-fly list. Downey's wife is going to have a baby in 3 days, so he needs to get back across the country desperately. But in the incident, he also lost his wallet. Downey is considering stealing a car, when Galifianakis drives by and offers to give Downey a ride. Downey would rather do anything in the world than ride with Galifianakis, who's been established as a goofy, well-meaning, but annoying imbecile, and who drives Downey nuts. But Downey sees no other choice. After a moment of agonizing indecision, he gets in the car.The rest of the movie is just funny bits involving Galifianakis needing to make detours to buy some marijuana for his glaucoma (Downey's character has never taken a toke in his life), Downey having to deal with Galifianakis' unsanitary method of making himself sleepy at night, Galifianakis' tendency to fall asleep at the wheel, and Downey's attempts to escape from Galifianakis and sometimes feeling like a heel for doing so.The questions are: Will Downey get to his wife in time before she gives birth? Will he escape from Galifianakis, or will they become friends after this 3-day ordeal? Is Downey's baby going to be black? (Downey's best friend in the movie is played by Jamie Foxx, who also used to date Downey's wife, played by Michelle Monaghan, and 9 months ago spent some ""secret"" time with her.)A funny buddy movie based on the premise of complete opposites being forced to be together, but without any lasting messages or points to take home.4 stars.",4,Entertaining Fluff,1291680000,"12 7, 2010",2010,2218,"['saw', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'movie', 'barely', 'memory-embedding', 'moment', 'did', 'hold', 'interest', 'laughed', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'movie', 'more', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'got', 'straight-laced', 'attitude', 'conflict', 'character', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'role', 'being', 'played', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'House', 'fame', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'actor', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'was', 'funny', 'too.The', 'set-up', 'thus', 'Downey', 'Galifianakis', 'are', 'strangers', 'taking', 'same', 'plane', 'LA', 'New', 'York', 'together', 'unfortunate', 'conversation', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'kicked', 'off', 'plane', 'suspected', 'terrorists', 'put', 'no-fly', 'list', 'Downey', 'wife', 'going', 'have', 'baby', '3', 'days', 'get', 'back', 'country', 'desperately', 'incident', 'also', 'lost', 'wallet', 'Downey', 'considering', 'stealing', 'car', 'when', 'Galifianakis', 'offers', 'give', 'Downey', 'ride', 'Downey', 'would', 'rather', 'do', 'anything', 'world', 'ride', 'Galifianakis', 'who', 'been', 'established', 'goofy', 'well-meaning', 'annoying', 'imbecile', 'who', 'Downey', 'nuts', 'Downey', 'other', 'choice', 'moment', 'agonizing', 'indecision', 'car.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'just', 'funny', 'bits', 'involving', 'Galifianakis', 'needing', 'make', 'detours', 'buy', 'marijuana', 'glaucoma', 'Downey', 'character', 'never', 'taken', 'toke', 'life', 'Downey', 'having', 'deal', 'Galifianakis', 'unsanitary', 'method', 'making', 'sleepy', 'night', 'Galifianakis', 'tendency', 'fall', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'Downey', 'attempts', 'escape', 'Galifianakis', 'sometimes', 'feeling', 'heel', 'doing', 'so.The', 'questions', 'are', 'Will', 'Downey', 'get', 'wife', 'time', 'birth', 'Will', 'escape', 'Galifianakis', 'will', 'become', 'friends', '3-day', 'ordeal', 'Downey', 'baby', 'going', 'be', 'black', 'Downey', 'best', 'friend', 'movie', 'played', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'who', 'also', 'used', 'date', 'Downey', 'wife', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', '9', 'months', 'ago', 'spent', 'secret', 'time', 'funny', 'buddy', 'movie', 'based', 'premise', 'complete', 'opposites', 'being', 'forced', 'be', 'together', 'lasting', 'messages', 'points', 'take', 'home.4', 'stars']",N/A

Of course there were still things I laughed at during this film especially the part with Juliette Lewis, the part with Danny Mcbride the legless veteran and the wonderful Galifianakis who has become quite a charm ever since his breakout role in the hangover.The movie itself was not bad it just was not anything too special. I honestly expected more from the film given all the talent on the set. It was like dinner for schmucks for me almost.

1302767,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B002ZG97II,Craig Whittle,"[1, 2]","DUE DATESTARRING: Robert Downey Jr., Zack Galifianakis, Michelle Monaghan, Jamie Foxx, Juliette Lewis, Danny McBride, Todd Phillips and RZAWRITTEN BY: Todd Phillips, Alan R. Cohen, Alan Freedland and Adam SztykielDIRECTED BY: Todd PhillipsRated: RGenre: ComedyRelease Date: 05 November 2010Review Date: 16 November 2010Due Date is without question the funniest film of 2010, with only The Other Guys at its heels. What makes this ironic and fantastic is that the best comedy of last year was The Hangover and Todd Phillips directed both Due Date and The Hangover. Good for him and good for people who like to laugh. Oh, and he's doing The Hangover Part II next year; see a pattern?I can help you very quickly in deciding if Due Date is a movie you will find amusing or not. I can do that with one simple question in fact, which is: Did you enjoy Planes, Trains and Automobiles? If you hated it, skip Due Date, if you loved it, you will love Due Date, and if you haven't seen it, then for God's sake - see both films this weekend!Due Date is molded in one of the most generic but favorable story fashions in American cinema; it's a road trip movie. Why it does so well, is that it gives us a nice melody of both the things we love in road movies (i.e. vehicles getting destroyed, an overly eccentric character or two) as well as a handful of new psychotically humorous things we haven't seen.Which brings me to the comedic genius that is the man, Zack Galifianakis; or Zack G, if you stumble over his name like I do. The guy is amazing. He makes things funny that if anyone else were to do, we would find repulsive or childishly immature and or simply not funny. As you might have guessed; Zack G gets to play the overly eccentric character; making up half the necessary equation in any buddy-pic or road movie, which Due Date is a perfect combination of.So naturally we need our straight man, right? Of course! Our Steve Martin of Planes, Trains and Automobiles or our David Spade of Tommy Boy. Enter, Robert Downey Jr. Only this time around, the straight guy has a tick to him, in which he has all the vulgar one-liners and at times results to violence in trying circumstances. Awesome!Downey plays an architect named Peter who is desperately trying to get home to his wife who will be having a C-section in a few days. But thanks to Ethan, a bearded repulsive weirdo (Zack G), Peter's plans are about to land in the dumpster. Ethan not only has both of them thrown off a plane when the two get into a spat, but Peter's name is added to a no-fly list. Road trip time, baby. But however can Peter get home to Los Angles, from Atlanta - when he's lost his wallet? Why, with Ethan in a rental car, of course.Ethan is heading to LA with high hopes of becoming a successful actor. At one point he re-enacts a Brando monologue from The Godfather for two potheads. When asked if he wrote that, he tells them with bitter dumbfounded earnest, that it was written by the mafia. He also tells people he's allergic to waffles and that he's 23 years old; Zack G is 41, mind you. You can imagine the looks that Downey gives his character Peter, in response to some of Ethan's comments, and they're as good as gold. Oh, yes - and wait till you see Ethan's headshots; priceless.Roger Ebert wrote in his 2  star review of this film, that the fact that Ethan decides to freely masturbate in the car with Peter sitting next to him trying to sleep, was not funny. I can't disagree with him more on this. I can at least admit that in plain text such as this, it may not sound all that humorous, but it was hysterical and Zack G's performance of doing so, and Robert Downey's reaction, made up one sensational scene! At least Ebert and I agreed that it WAS funny when Ethan's small dog mimics him at this. Good for you, Ebe!To tell anymore would be to spoil a real treat at the theater, folks. Its 95 minutes with two talented actors, doing hilarious things in the course of a well written and directed film. Ethan is a sweet but creepy man-child and Peter is an A-hole who is aware of it, and trying to fix it.

1302769,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG97II,C. Sawin,"[4, 6]","Last year, Todd Phillips brought us The Hangover. Along with its massive success, it helped turn its three lead actors into even bigger stars. Included in that line up was Zach Galifianakis, stand-up comedian turned actor who now seems to be Phillips go to guy. So how could Galifianakis possibly top being in the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time? He teams up with the man who became known for his portrayal of Tony Stark in Iron Man and Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, Robert Downey Jr, for the most outrageous comedy of 2010.Seeing Robert Downey Jr in a film like this after his career exploded from doing Iron Man seems more outstanding than it really is. Or maybe it's just the mere thought of seeing the lead actor from some of the past few years biggest blockbusters in an R-rated comedy that features his character get high and be extremely ill tempered throughout its duration is entertaining in itself and strangely liberating. There isn't source material to follow that if strayed too far away from could cause fans to go into an uproar. Due Date is an original film and it just seems like doing comedy after two superhero films and a film based on the world's most infamous fictional detective would be creative freedom of sorts.There was some concern that Zach Galifianakis' character in Due Date would be too similar to his character in The Hangover to really deliver a lot of laughs or be distinguishable in comparison. Truth be told, both characters are extremely similar but it works so well. Galifianakis is so funny, it hurts. Ethan Tremblay's ignorance is really what makes the film so incredibly ridiculous, over the top, and just downright hysterical. The blossoming friendship between Peter and Ethan is where the heart of the film truly lies though. The chemistry between both RDJ and Galifianakis is what makes so many scenes in the film so great. Watching Peter be in agony over having to deal with Ethan and his eccentric ways is pure comedy gold.An interesting note about the film is that nearly every scene from the trailer is in the film. With all the alternate takes and deleted scenes that get shuffled around these days before a film gets released in theaters, that's saying a lot. It does make you wonder what sort of extras will be on the DVD and BD versions of the film though. One scene comes to mind that wasn't in the film, but that's it. Everything else that you've probably memorized (""You better check yourself before you wreck yourself."") is in there.A few scenes to be on the lookout for, Peter has a certain way of dealing with the kids of a local drug dealer named Heidi (played by Juliette Lewis) that is sure to get an outstanding reaction from a packed theater. Also, the film puts an awkward yet priceless spin on the simple act of masturbating . There are so many gloriously preposterous things that transpire in the film that it should give you plenty of material to talk about with friends for days.It's safe to consider Due Date as this year's The Hangover and that should definitely be taken as a compliment. It's the same director and one third of the main cast, but Due Date manages to set the bar for ludicrous acts achieved in film. Zach Galifianakis will provide most of the laughs, but it's the chemistry between both him and Robert Downey Jr that makes the comedy feel a bit more genuine than other comedies out there. With the end of 2010 just around the corner, Due Date may just be the funniest film of the year.",4,Outrageous and hilarious,1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,3486,"['Last', 'year', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'brought', 'Hangover', 'massive', 'success', 'helped', 'turn', 'three', 'lead', 'actors', 'even', 'bigger', 'stars', 'Included', 'line', 'up', 'was', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'turned', 'actor', 'who', 'now', 'be', 'Phillips', 'go', 'guy', 'So', 'how', 'could', 'Galifianakis', 'possibly', 'top', 'being', 'highest', 'grossing', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'time', 'up', 'man', 'who', 'became', 'known', 'portrayal', 'Tony', 'Stark', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'most', 'outrageous', 'comedy', '2010.Seeing', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'film', 'career', 'exploded', 'doing', 'Iron', 'Man', 'more', 'outstanding', 'really', 'just', 'mere', 'thought', 'seeing', 'lead', 'actor', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'biggest', 'blockbusters', 'R-rated', 'comedy', 'character', 'get', 'high', 'be', 'extremely', 'ill', 'tempered', 'duration', 'entertaining', 'strangely', 'liberating', ""n't"", 'source', 'material', 'follow', 'strayed', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'could', 'cause', 'fans', 'go', 'uproar', 'Due', 'Date', 'original', 'film', 'just', 'doing', 'comedy', 'two', 'superhero', 'films', 'film', 'based', 'world', 'most', 'infamous', 'fictional', 'detective', 'would', 'be', 'creative', 'freedom', 'sorts.There', 'was', 'concern', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'character', 'Due', 'Date', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'similar', 'character', 'Hangover', 'really', 'deliver', 'lot', 'laughs', 'be', 'distinguishable', 'comparison', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'similar', 'so', 'well', 'Galifianakis', 'so', 'funny', 'Ethan', 'Tremblay', 'ignorance', 'really', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'incredibly', 'ridiculous', 'top', 'just', 'downright', 'hysterical', 'blossoming', 'friendship', 'Peter', 'Ethan', 'where', 'heart', 'film', 'truly', 'chemistry', 'RDJ', 'Galifianakis', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'scenes', 'film', 'so', 'great', 'Watching', 'Peter', 'be', 'agony', 'having', 'deal', 'Ethan', 'eccentric', 'ways', 'pure', 'comedy', 'gold.An', 'interesting', 'note', 'film', 'nearly', 'scene', 'trailer', 'film', 'alternate', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'get', 'shuffled', 'days', 'film', 'released', 'theaters', 'saying', 'lot', 'make', 'wonder', 'what', 'sort', 'extras', 'will', 'be', 'DVD', 'BD', 'versions', 'film', 'One', 'scene', 'mind', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'Everything', 'else', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'memorized', 'better', 'check', 'wreck', 'there.A', 'few', 'scenes', 'be', 'lookout', 'Peter', 'certain', 'way', 'dealing', 'kids', 'local', 'drug', 'dealer', 'named', 'Heidi', 'played', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'sure', 'get', 'outstanding', 'reaction', 'packed', 'theater', 'Also', 'film', 'awkward', 'yet', 'priceless', 'spin', 'simple', 'act', 'masturbating', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'gloriously', 'preposterous', 'things', 'transpire', 'film', 'should', 'give', 'plenty', 'material', 'talk', 'friends', 'days.It', 'safe', 'consider', 'Due', 'Date', 'year', 'Hangover', 'should', 'definitely', 'be', 'taken', 'compliment', 'same', 'director', 'one', 'third', 'main', 'cast', 'Due', 'Date', 'set', 'bar', 'ludicrous', 'acts', 'achieved', 'film', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'will', 'provide', 'most', 'laughs', 'chemistry', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'comedy', 'feel', 'bit', 'more', 'genuine', 'other', 'comedies', 'there', 'end', '2010', 'just', 'corner', 'Due', 'Date', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'funniest', 'film', 'year']",N/A

Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis as a mismatched couple, would likely end up in a bitter divorce. Of all mismatched buddy movies, this match is made in hell. Director Todd Philips should take a leaf from early buddy movies such as 48 hours, Lethal Weapon and the aforementioned John Hughes holiday classic for a template.Other than the badly miscast Downey Jr., who should be in Zach's role in my opinion, is a typical Type A tightass yuppie. Zach is a social misfit and with all his eccentricities considered, it's a wonder he's not being committed in an asylum. Carrying pot wherever you go, jerking off in front of a stranger? Come on, all these are ingredients for getting your hind thrown into the joint.

1302771,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B002ZG97II,DanD,"[0, 1]","DUE DATE isn't a grand bit of comedy, in the vein of THE HANGOVER, though it tries.  Instead, it's much smaller in scope, which actually has its benefits.  The film concerns the stuck-up Peter Highman (Downey Jr.), struggling to make the birth of his child.  Because of a misunderstanding on the airline, he is relegated to hitching a ride cross-country with Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis).  Hi-jinks ensue.Todd Phillips is retreading HANGOVER territory (before an actual sequel was developed, this film was referred to as ""Hangover 2""), but that's okay.  If you can get past the lack of originality, DUE DATE is actually quite enjoyable.  Downey Jr. and Galifianakis have great chemistry, and both are masters at this sort of comedy.  Michele Monaghan is grossly underused as Highman's wife, though it's great to see her and Downey Jr. reunited (remember KISS KISS BANG BANG?  You darn well should).  We also get supporting roles fro RZA, Jamie Foxx, Danny McBride, Juliette Lewis, and Jon Cryer and Charlie Sheen (in one of the most desperate, yet funniest, tie-ins ever).  The result is a crude, yet memorable comedy with some genuine heart (like all great comedians, Downey Jr. and Galifianakis are both great at finding the emotional center of their characters) and a whole lot of laughs.

Through a series of ""leave your brain at the door to enjoy"" happenings, the two decide to travel cross country together attempting to arrive at the LA hospital in time for the birth of Highman's baby. This isn't Homer's Odyssey by any means, but the two do cross paths with numerous interesting characters and learn more about each other along the way.While the film really never goes anywhere, being stuck in neutral with the perfect straight guy absorbing jokes from one of Hollywood's new leading funny guys, there are many worse ways to spend your time at the movies. There are more holes in the storyline than I could count, and law enforcement is seemingly non-existent after the first ten minutes of the movie, but again, I still found myself laughing quite a bit. And for all of the R-rated comedies released in the past few years, this is one of the cleanest of the bunch (but it still earns it's R rating.)Overall, I would recommend this flick to those just looking to laugh. It's not complex, not award-worthy, not going to blow you away - but it is going to make you laugh for the better part of 90 minutes.",3,"Good, Not Great",1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,1614,"['Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'up', 'star', 'director', 'Hangover', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'road', 'comedy', 'Due', 'Date.When', 'two', 'people', 'get', 'argument', 'airplane', 'find', 'no-fly', 'list', 'having', 'make', 'other', 'arrangements', 'get', 'Atlanta', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'One', 'people', 'nonsense', 'businessman', 'father', 'be', 'Peter', 'Highman', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'other', 'grieving', 'yet', 'oddly', 'upbeat', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'Ethan', 'Tremblay', 'Galifianakis', 'series', 'leave', 'brain', 'door', 'enjoy', 'happenings', 'two', 'decide', 'travel', 'cross', 'country', 'together', 'attempting', 'arrive', 'LA', 'hospital', 'time', 'birth', 'Highman', 'baby', ""n't"", 'Homer', 'Odyssey', 'means', 'two', 'do', 'cross', 'paths', 'numerous', 'interesting', 'characters', 'learn', 'more', 'other', 'way.While', 'film', 'really', 'never', 'anywhere', 'being', 'stuck', 'neutral', 'perfect', 'straight', 'guy', 'absorbing', 'jokes', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'new', 'leading', 'funny', 'guys', 'are', 'many', 'worse', 'ways', 'spend', 'time', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'holes', 'storyline', 'could', 'count', 'law', 'enforcement', 'seemingly', 'non-existent', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'movie', 'again', 'still', 'found', 'laughing', 'quite', 'bit', 'R-rated', 'comedies', 'released', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'one', 'cleanest', 'bunch', 'still', 'R', 'rating', 'Overall', 'would', 'recommend', 'flick', 'just', 'looking', 'laugh', 'not', 'complex', 'not', 'award-worthy', 'not', 'going', 'blow', 'away', 'going', 'make', 'better', 'part', '90', 'minutes']",N/A

Everything has been arranged, the airplane tickets are booked he just gotta go to the airport, set in his first class seat and viola ! However, things get pretty messed up when he unexpectedly bumps into a Pot head, inspiring actor Ethan Trembley (Zach Galifianakis) who wants to go to Hollywood. Not only does Ethan accidentally switch bags full of Marijuana with Peter. He also manages to get him kicked off the plane because of some lame joke about terrorist. Now Peter is pissed ! He can't fly cuz the airline company won't let him, he doesn't have his luggage, wallet or any money. He doesn't even have his license so he can't rent a car but he have to be in LA for the birth of his first baby, so what should he do ? The only solution. Ride with the man who was the reason for his misery.O.K, I don't really know why people are ""comparing"" this with the Hangover I've seen that movie, I know it's been directed by the same person, it has Zach Galifianakis in it also and they are both road trip films except the Hangover only took place in Las Vegas while this manages to wander around between Kansas, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Arizona and eventually LA but come'on guys this movie couldn't be more different than the Hangover even if it tried.I have to say I really felt bad for Peter in this movie, I mean Ethan really made him go through hell trying to get him to LA. Ethan was very hard to like at first, I mean he's kinda the geek, weirdo guy who's also a pot head and everyone is trying to ignore and needs a hair cut really bad but then I soften up a little for him. The part in the plane was really funny ! I kept on laughing at that. Another part that had me laughing out loud was the part where Peter was high and he imagined Ethan as a bear, that was soo funny ! There were also other funny moments too like the sleeping while driving thing and the dog sunny !On top of that I thought the scenery was really beautiful, I mean you got to see the landscapes and even the Grand Canyon too, almost a year ago I went on a trip to the West Coast we went to see California, Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon so it kinda brought back memories for me.

That's it.In an update to the problem of getting on a plane from the first film, Due Date sullies the good name of our passenger-gropers at the TSA by placing our intrepid heroes on the no-fly list. There are some bag mix-ups and other really, really weak coincidences to force this situation but needless to say they both end up in a rental car pegging it across the country while they get to learn about each other.Before we get any further, I should point out that this is another ""all the funny parts are in the trailer"" movie though anything that looks mildly amusing in the promo is more unpleasant when you watch the whole thing. For example, RDJ at one point spits in the dog's face - HE SPITS IN THE DOG'S FACE - and then threatens to rip it apart limb from limb. Violence to humans can be funny - it's the basis of the banana skin joke and most cartoons - but violence to animals always falls flat. He then goes on to punch an 8-year old - no kidding.The character arc that's jammed into Act 3 is one of the most unconvincing in modern cinema. When RDJ decides to be best pals with Zach, I felt like I'd  accidentally cued forward 10 minutes and missed a bunch of important scenes. 5 minutes earlier he'd rammed Zach's head into the side of a car panel and now suddenly they're soul mates.Due Date is possibly the most unpleasant film experience of the year (barring any sequel to Touristas I don't know about), consistently confusing comedy with cruelty and it may continue to rank as one of the cruelest films of the decade (at least until the Farrelly Brothers write another script). In case there's any confusion, I hated this film.

I suppose one could watch them back to back and ponder the societal changes that have gone down in the intervening quarter century as reflected in what's acceptable fare on the screen.  Instead, I personally spent most of the last half hour of the movie wondering if our border crossings with Mexico had become so lax that an obviously stolen vehicle, driven by two people without ID, can get so easily into the United States.

In the process, he ""loses"" his wallet and, by a mixture of circumstances, has to travel across the county with the same nutcase who got him thrown off the plane.  During the journey, they get into a mix of trouble.What I liked:  Zach Zach Galifianakis is really funny throughout -- great scenes and acting.  The obliviousness to societal ""norms"" is what makes it funny.  As you see in the preview, Robert Downey Jr.'s character is telling a sad tale of his father leaving him as a child.  After hearing it, Galifianakis starts cracking up laughing and says something about how his father would never do that because he loved him.Disliked:  Some of the craziness is overdone; needed more edgy scenes and clever ideas in some points of the film; the Mexico scene was a bit much.Overall:  VERY GOOD for a mindless comedy.

But while that movie was light and funny, and quite often genuinely from the heart, this movie aims below the belt, and is often dark and cruel.The cool little twist to this movie (at least to me) is that Robert Downey Jr.'s Peter is very much a sarcastic prick.  Yeah, he earns it, since Galifianakis' character is so intolerable, but it's nice that Peter has an edge.I think the problem is that even though the movie is occasionally funny, Galifianakis' behavior is beyond disgusting and repulsive, and yet the movie seemingly looks down at Peter for his reaction to it.  Whenever Peter lets loose to tell Galifianakis' Ethan what a slob he is, he either pays for it by being physically hurt or is forced to apologize.What saves this movie is Downey Jr. -- because quite honestly, he's the one who has all the laughs.  For all the crazy behavior by Galifianakis, it's actually Downey who gets you laughing.  His wrinkle-faced expressions of disbelief are hilarious.The movie goes into loony-tunes territory later on, when Peter and Ethan get into all sorts of illegal activity, and the movie conveniently fails to mention why they're not put in jail for the rest of their lives at the end of the film.Michelle Monaghan (reuniting with ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" co-star Downey), Jamie Foxx (who almost doesn't seem to know why he's in the movie) and Juliette Lewis are completely forgettable and wasted.What ""Due Date"" really is is just a cash-grab by Todd Phillips, who threw together the film with Galifianakis to capitalize on the success of ""The Hangover.""

1302810,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B002ZG97II,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[2, 3]","Following up The Hangover, Todd Phillips directs and co-writes Due Date, a road movie in the vein of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. With the unlikely comedic duo of Robert Downey, Jr. and Zack Galifianakis leading the film and appearances by Danny McBride, Juliette Lewis, Jamie Foxx, and Michelle Monaghan, Due Date could have been something really special. While it's funny and entertaining enough, I couldn't help but think there could have been something...More.Peter Highman (Downey, Jr.) is travelling from Atlanta to Los Angeles to be with his wife (Monaghan) while she delivers their first child. His troubles begin from the moment he arrives at the airport, where he first meets Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis). Soon, he finds himself kicked off the plane, on the no-fly list, and with no way to rent a car because he's without his wallet. In a moment of desperation, Peter accepts a ride from Ethan, an aspiring actor, also on his way to California who offers to drive Peter to Los Angeles as well as pay for the whole trip.If you've seen the trailer, you probably knew all of this. Ethan is an aspiring actor, who claims to be 23-years-old, is carrying his father's ashes in a coffee can, and travels with his dog Sonny. Some people assume Galifianakis is just recycling his character Alan from The Hangover. While there are similarities between Alan and Ethan, they share a similar flamboyant, stupid personality and, obviously the same actor but they are different characters. While Alan was more childlike, like a small boy trapped in the body of a grown man; Ethan just seems oblivious to his stupidity and the destruction he causes. Downey, Jr. plays the same egotistical and self-centered character he's been making his living from playing over the last few years (with a few notable exceptions, of course), except Peter lacks the charm of his usual ventures. Throughout the film, Peter tends to be a thoroughly unlikable character. In fact, Ethan is so stupid and Peter is so despicable that many people will not like this film based on that characterization alone.Sort of uncharacteristic of a studio film, the movie is built on mean-spirited humor. Obviously mean-spirited humor comprises almost every comedy released in theatres today, but Due Date is much meaner than you'd think. In two scenes played for laughs, Downey, Jr. spits on a dog and punches a child. Some may find these scenes offensive, I found them to be some of the funniest moments in the movie. All of the comedy comes from situational humor and irreverent, funny one-liners and while some of these one-liners are very funny (""We split a six-pack...of 40's""), some fail at even being amusing (""He's a famous pirate. And his name was Shakesbeard""). There's also an oddly amusing sight gag, never before used in a movie before, to my knowledge, in the form of a masturbating dog.The hilarious Danny McBride takes the spotlight away from the two leads in his brief, but hilarious scene as a Western Union clerk/Iraqi war veteran. Most of the bit roles are amusing, but considering the talent involved it should be much better than it is. I blame the script for this as it doesn't move through the plot so much as stumble through it. Every scene seems built on how bad Ethan can screw Peter over, with each scene trying to one-up the scene before it. Some have said its derivative of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles and, yes it has a similar structure, but plenty of movies have used this same premise since that film was released. However, Phillips and co. could have taken a few pointers from that film, specifically in the relationship between Peter and Ethan.As a foil for Peter, Ethan probably gets Peter in more trouble than any character has before in a movie like this. In every movie of this sort, where the smart, successful protagonist about to reach his breaking point must team up with the simpleton there's usually a sense of companionship between the two even though one can't stand the other. While Peter is shown to have some compassion for Ethan, he seems to genuinely despise him and even tells him this several times. Downey, Jr. and Galifianakis share a strange comedic chemistry together and a gift for both deadpan and off-the-cuff one-liners, but they don't share a personal chemistry. It seems highly unlikely that Peter would ever befriend Ethan and when the film tries to give it heart, it just feels forced. Due Date could have benefitted from keeping it mean, going against the grain a bit, and keeping Peter the same throughout; people already don't like his character, so why try to make him a good person to no avail?Due Date is no comedy classic and it lacks heart, but it has a cast that makes it worth watching. Downey, Jr. and Galifianakis are an unlikely, dysfunctional pair with such contrasting personalities that there's something fun in watching the two together. While many people will find it wholly unappealing, I was amused enough by it and it was a brisk 90-minute comedy that made me smile. My head is telling me to give it 3-stars, but as far as simple entertainment it warrants a 4-star rating. It's worth a rental, but don't expect something too memorable.GRADE: B-",4,"Not for Everyone; But an Enjoyable, If Not Too Memorable, Comedy",1296691200,"02 3, 2011",2011,5200,"['Following', 'up',

Zach Galifiankis has his moments in his role, but grated on me at times. Overall the humor is uneven, and it started off slow. Although it has some funny moments, it also has many that fall flat, and some of the attempts to make the movie more soulful didn't quite work (to be fair, some did.)Through a very unbelievable set of events these two characters are thrown together on a road-trip across country, to try and make it to the birth of the Downey character's first child. They are opposites - Downey's character is clean, orderly, and uptight, Galifiankis's is dirty, sloppy, and annoying. They both have emotional baggage having to do with their fathers, and at times their emotions related to this baggage create touching moments, but at other times it just falls flat. The same goes for much of the humor - it either works or completely flops.If you like either of these actors, it's worth your time, or if you are looking for a few laughs but are OK with some flops in between.

1302837,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG97II,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","Road trips always seem to make funny movies. The discomfort of those forced to endure another irritating person or having to make do with a bad situation are situations we've all been faced with. So why not get a laugh out of the same thing at someone else's expense? It made the hilarious PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES one of the funniest movies even after 23 years. Yes it has been that long. Who better to take the reins from Steve Martin and John Candy than Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis?DUE DATE begins with architect Peter Highman (Downey) trying to make it home from Atlanta in time for the birth of his son. He begins by nearly being killed as he exits his limo by some yokel dropping off Ethan Trembly (Galifianakis). This leads to a misunderstanding (and some hilarity as Ethan attempts to put his luggage in the overheard) leaving Peter on the no-fly list, suspected of terrorism. Who else is there to blame but the goofy Ethan?With his wallet packed and on the plane, Peter searches for a way home. Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, one presents itself when Ethan shows up with a rental car insisting that Peter join him for the road trip to LA. And so begins one of the most famous road trips that has some of the funniest moments in a comedy of late.As the pair travel we get to see Peter as a stick in the mud, serious person with little room for anything in his life other than his own needs. On the other hand Ethan moves about willy nilly without a care in the world, looking at the trip as fun and taking care of his pet dog Sonny. In point of fact, this trip will change both men. Peter will learn in the oddest way possible what it means to be a father and take care of someone. Ethan will face the reality of his father's death.That's another part of the story. Along for the ride carried in a coffee can are the ashes of Ethan's recently deceased father. As Peter maps out their route to get them there in time, Ethan mentions that the Grand Canyon would be a great place for his father's ashes to which Peter informs him that it's miles out of their way. The topic comes up again later with a different location, each time revealing something more about Ethan.The duo make their way cross country, stopping to pick up some weed (it's medicinal for Ethan's ""glaucoma""), crashing their car, finding they have no money, a run in with a vet at Western Union and more. Each scene seems to offer more laughs than the last and no, I won't spoil them by giving you details here. Suffice to say that there were moments that I had to either pause the movie or back it up once I stopped laughing.But there is a sweetness to this movie as well. And that's another thing that reminded me of the earlier PLANES. We have two characters, both stuffy and all businesslike that end up next to someone with a lot of well hidden pain in their life. The question becomes less about the physical trip and more about the emotional one that they both make.Downey shines here as the jerk that has the best intentions in his decisions, a man who is fearful that he won't make the birth of his child. Short tempered most of the time and very caring at others, he makes the journey to fatherhood over the miles. Galifianakis turns in his usual solid performance as the waif who needs something more in his life. His trip to Hollywood in hopes of being an actor, even though his character shows little ability, shows the dreams that so many have. My biggest fear with him is that he will find himself pigeonholed into these same roles. This one seems very much like the one he played in THE HANGOVER. It's a curse that many comedic actors fall into but few rise out of. Take a look at Pauley Shore for a bad example.The movie offers some terribly crude moments that are sure to offend some and make others laugh till their sides split. For the sake of my family I'll plead the fifth (although one scene involving both Ethan and Sonny made me laugh harder when I saw the shocked look on my wife's face while we watched the movie). And when the final sequence shows, amazingly enough during the whole Charlie Sheen brouhaha of late, you'll find yourself touched by these two men and the trip they took. It's a fun film that most will enjoy and will inspire at least a smile or two from everyone.",4,"NO PLANE, NO TRAIN, JUST ONE LONG DRIVE",1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,4303,"['Road', 'trips', 'always', 'seem', 'make', 'funny', 'movies', 'discomfort', 'forced', 'endure', 'irritating', 'person', 'having', 'make', 'do', 'bad', 'situation', 'are', 'situations', ""'ve"", 'been', 'faced', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'get', 'laugh', 'same', 'thing', 'someone', 'else', 'expense', 'made', 'hilarious', 'PLANES', 'TRAINS', 'AND', 'AUTOMOBILES', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'even', '23', 'years', 'Yes', 'been', 'long', 'Who', 'better', 'take', 'reins', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'John', 'Candy', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'DUE', 'DATE', 'architect', 'Peter', 'Highman', 'Downey', 'trying', 'make', 'home', 'Atlanta', 'time', 'birth', 'son', 'nearly', 'being', 'killed', 'limo', 'yokel', 'dropping', 'off', 'Ethan', 'Trembly', 'Galifianakis', 'misunderstanding', 'hilarity', 'Ethan', 'put', 'luggage', 'overheard', 'leaving', 'Peter', 'no-fly', 'list', 'suspected', 'terrorism', 'Who', 'else', 'there', 'blame', 'goofy', 'Ethan', 'wallet', 'packed', 'plane', 'Peter', 'way', 'home', 'Fortunately', 'perhaps', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'presents', 'when', 'Ethan', 'up', 'rental', 'car', 'insisting', 'Peter', 'join', 'road', 'trip', 'LA', 'so', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'road', 'trips', 'funniest', 'moments', 'comedy', 'late.As', 'pair', 'travel', 'get', 'see', 'Peter', 'stick', 'mud', 'serious', 'person', 'little', 'room', 'anything', 'life', 'other', 'own', 'needs', 'other', 'hand', 'Ethan', 'willy', 'nilly', 'care', 'world', 'looking', 'trip', 'fun', 'taking', 'care', 'pet', 'dog', 'Sonny', 'point', 'fact', 'trip', 'will', 'change', 'men', 'Peter', 'will', 'learn', 'oddest', 'way', 'possible', 'what', 'be', 'father', 'take', 'care', 'someone', 'Ethan', 'will', 'face', 'reality', 'father', 'death.That', 'part', 'story', 'ride', 'carried', 'coffee', 'can', 'are', 'ashes', 'Ethan', 'recently', 'deceased', 'father', 'Peter', 'out', 'route', 'get', 'there', 'time', 'Ethan', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'place', 'father', 'ashes', 'Peter', 'miles', 'way', 'topic', 'up', 'again', 'later', 'different', 'location', 'time', 'revealing', 'something', 'more', 'Ethan.The', 'duo', 'make', 'way', 'cross', 'country', 'stopping', 'pick', 'up', 'weed', 'medicinal', 'Ethan', 'glaucoma', 'crashing', 'car', 'finding', 'have', 'money', 'run', 'vet', 'Western', 'Union', 'more', 'scene', 'offer', 'more', 'laughs', 'last', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'giving', 'details', 'here', 'Suffice', 'say', 'were', 'moments', 'had', 'pause', 'movie', 'back', 'up', 'once', 'stopped', 'laughing.But', 'sweetness', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'thing', 'reminded', 'earlier', 'PLANES', 'have', 'two', 'characters', 'stuffy', 'businesslike', 'end', 'up', 'next', 'someone', 'lot', 'well', 'hidden', 'pain', 'life', 'question', 'less', 'physical', 'trip', 'more', 'emotional', 'one', 'make.Downey', 'shines', 'here', 'jerk', 'best', 'intentions', 'decisions', 'man', 'who', 'fearful', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'birth', 'child', 'Short', 'tempered', 'most', 'time', 'very', 'caring', 'others', 'journey', 'fatherhood', 'miles', 'Galifianakis', 'usual', 'solid', 'performance', 'waif', 'who', 'something', 'more', 'life', 'trip', 'Hollywood', 'hopes', 'being', 'actor', 'even', 'character', 'little', 'ability', 'dreams', 'so', 'many', 'have', 'biggest', 'fear', 'will', 'find', 'pigeonholed', 'same', 'roles', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'played', 'THE', 'HANGOVER', 'curse', 'many', 'comedic', 'actors', 'fall', 'few', 'rise', 'Take', 'look', 'Pauley', 'Shore', 'bad', 'example.The', 'movie', 'terribly', 'crude', 'moments', 'are', 'sure', 'offend', 'make', 'others', 'till', 'sides', 'split', 'sake', 'family', ""'ll"", 'plead', 'fifth', 'one', 'scene', 'involving', 'Ethan', 'Sonny', 'made', 'harder', 'when', 'saw', 'shocked', 'look', 'wife', 'face', 'watched', 'movie', 'when', 'final', 'sequence', 'shows', 'amazingly', 'enough', 'whole', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'brouhaha', 'late', ""'ll"", 'find', 'touched', 'two', 'men', 'trip', 'took', 'fun', 'film', 'most', 'will', 'enjoy', 'will', 'inspire', 'least', 'smile', 'two', 'everyone']",N/A

Downey's past paranoid roles and Galifianakis' past silly acting out have always inconvenienced my joy of going to the movie theaters. Watching the previews of this movie did not help either. Yet, getting to see the real movie was quite a surprise.In the early part of the movie, I got a taste of unease from the artificial and fake conversation of the two actors at the airport. Strange people would not indulge in such smooth chat and in-depth dialogue within seconds of their encounter. Of course, there were few other fake and artificial scenarios in the movie beside the bad start. Those were mitigated by the compromise made by Downey to behave as normal person, as opposed to his past egocentric mannerism, and by Galifianakis to pretend to be an absolute moron, which he fits in perfectly.The extreme diversity of two characters; one immature, illiterate, doped low lifer, bordering insanity; the other objective, well mannered, and prospering, made the movie a great success. As the conflict unfolds between an insane, immature, hysterical, and dependent character and a realistic, objective, and focused adult, there come moments when the two strange folks needed each other in order to survive through many twists of fate.The two extreme characters are well represented in society as were the circumstances that gathered them in one unlikely ordeal that ended in attending the birth of a newborn.The comedy exposes the casual and prevalent social and intellectual decay in society. From state officials who could not perform the basic requirements of their duties that exposed an innocent citizen to life and death situations as he was assumed guilty on mere suspicion, to the wide spread addiction to marijuana and illicit drugs to transform its addicts to deviant actors.",5,Unexpected triumph of two egocentric actors,1289433600,"11 11, 2010",2010,1886,"['Getting', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Zach', 'Galifianakis', 'share', 'successful', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'expectation', 'Downey', 'past', 'paranoid', 'roles', 'Galifianakis', 'past', 'silly', 'acting', 'out', 'have', 'always', 'inconvenienced', 'joy', 'going', 'movie', 'theaters', 'Watching', 'previews', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'either', 'getting', 'see', 'real', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'surprise.In', 'early', 'part', 'movie', 'got', 'taste', 'unease', 'artificial', 'fake', 'conversation', 'two', 'actors', 'airport', 'Strange', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'indulge', 'such', 'smooth', 'chat', 'in-depth', 'dialogue', 'seconds', 'encounter', 'course', 'were', 'few', 'other', 'fake', 'artificial', 'scenarios', 'movie', 'bad', 'start', 'were', 'mitigated', 'compromise', 'made', 'Downey', 'behave', 'normal', 'person', 'opposed', 'past', 'egocentric', 'mannerism', 'Galifianakis', 'pretend', 'be', 'absolute', 'moron', 'perfectly.The', 'extreme', 'diversity', 'two', 'characters', 'one', 'immature', 'illiterate', 'doped', 'low', 'lifer', 'bordering', 'insanity', 'other', 'objective', 'well', 'mannered', 'prospering', 'made', 'movie', 'great', 'success', 'conflict', 'insane', 'immature', 'hysterical', 'dependent', 'character', 'realistic', 'objective', 'focused', 'adult', 'come', 'moments', 'when', 'two', 'strange', 'folks', 'needed', 'other', 'order', 'survive', 'many', 'twists', 'fate.The', 'two', 'extreme', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'represented', 'society', 'were', 'circumstances', 'gathered', 'one', 'unlikely', 'ordeal', 'ended', 'attending', 'birth', 'newborn.The', 'comedy', 'casual', 'prevalent', 'social', 'intellectual', 'decay', 'society', 'state', 'officials', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'perform', 'basic', 'requirements', 'duties', 'exposed', 'innocent', 'citizen', 'life', 'death', 'situations', 'was', 'assumed', 'guilty', 'mere', 'suspicion', 'wide', 'spread', 'addiction', 'marijuana', 'illicit', 'drugs', 'transform', 'addicts', 'deviant', 'actors']",N/A

I would counter that the real problem is the overuse of character types and traits by the same actors or actresses across multiple movies.  This movie, Due Date, exemplifies my point.  The movie is about two men who go on a cross-country road trip which leads to them bonding as friends.  Robert Downey Jr. plays one character, a self-made, successful man who lost his father while young, and has a successful black man as his best friend.  This sounds oddly reminiscent of his character in the Iron Man movies.  The other main character of Due Date is played by Zach Galifianakis.  His character is an idiot, disturbed, gross, yet desperately seeking friendship to the point of doing cruel, underhanded things to the other people.  This sounds too close to his character in The Hangover films to be mere coincidence.  And seeing that this movie came out so close to the latest Iron Man and Hangover movies takes away from its innovative and original plot line, and some of its humor also.

Unfortunetly, while the film was still enjoyable, it wasn't what it could have been.  For one thing, it ought to have somehow had more of Michelle Monaghan, who, in my opinion, is someone whose talent as an actress is rarely put to use to its full potencial.  We could have also used more of Jamie Foxx, though he's seen much more screen time in his career.  The plot was a decent idea, though it had been used already in films such as Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.  Ultimately, I am not sure what exactly caused this film to fall so far below its expectations.  Maybe it was bad writing, bad direction, bad something else, or a combination.  Maybe it's simply because, while the idea of the straight-man Robert Downey, Jr., and goofy Zach Galifianakis might look good on paper, it simply didn't work in real life...that just sometimes happens.  But, being a fan of both actors, I didn't find this film the worst in the world.  Everybody definetly tried to make it work and that should be applauded.

He's got a ticket to fly back home, because his wife (Michelle Monaghan) is scheduled to deliver their first child in just a few days.  Zack Galifianakis is the strange, troublesome guy who utterly messes up his plans...and the two are forced to embark on a road trip across the country together in a bid to reach California in time.  5 days should be plenty of time, but if you've ever seen a film like this...you know that there will be many frustrating delays along with way.Galifianakis dreams of heading to Hollywood to come an actor, even though he has no experience.  He carries with him, in a coffee can, the ashes of his recently deceased father and also this French bulldog...an animal that gets laughs just by looking at him.  Galifianakis causes havoc everywhere he goes, with almost everything he touches, but his blissfully unaware.  He comes across as just a little simple minded.  Downey is very much the straight man; he's the victim of almost all the terrible consequences Galifianakis brings down on them.  He's uptight and humorless, a real misanthrope.The biggest laughs, frankly, come from the interplay between this odd couple.  Their dialogue.  The two characters operate on such different levels that they seldom seem to be on the same page.  There are other, more slap-sticky laughs, with car crashes and perhaps the least likely ""escape from the cops and lead them on a chase"" scene you're ever going to see.  But these two pros really banter together nicely.But the movie tries to intersperse ""touching"" moments (mostly revolving around memories of fathers) into the often highly crude proceedings.  These scenes, frankly, feel forced and clumsy.  We can sort of believe Galifianakis' odd remembrances of his deceased dad, but when Downey abruptly spills his heart...it feels almost like that scene in GREMLINS when Phoebe Cates suddenly talks about the death of her dad.  It's abrupt, clumsily written and because it generates no real emotion, becomes almost laughable.  (In fact, Galifianakis has a wonderful reaction to the moment and thankfully sets the tone right again.)There is a supporting cast, but mostly they do far from their best work.  Jamie Foxx appears briefly and looks to be in a hurry to get out of the film.  Danny McBride delivers his usual shtick (but he does have a good line about making a reservation for Chili's).  Juliette Lewis appears as a drug dealer and is given nothing to do.  And Michelle Monaghan, who was SO good with Downey in KISS, KISS, BANG, BANG mostly spends time on the phone pleading with hubby to come back...ANYONE could have played her part.Because the film generates no emotional resonance (it simply tries too hard), it leaves room to notice bothersome things.  The film seems to imply that El Paso/Juarez are fairly near to I-40, when in fact they are 4 hours apart.  Vehicles are abandoned (what DOES happen to the Range Rover?) and we have the time to wonder about them.Director and co-writer Todd Phillips did such a great job with THE HANGOVER.  He gave us annoying characters that we grew to like.  The movie tied up all loose ends (heck, the entire thing was pretty much about tying up loose ends).  While it was obscene at times, it was always funny.  DUE DATE is frequently obscene and cringe-inducing.  It spends too much time showing characters on drugs (don't moviemakers get that extended sequences showing a character that doesn't do drugs getting stoned aren't really all that funny?).  It leaves loose ends everywhere it goes.  THE HANGOVER didn't try for ""touching moments""...it just tried to be the funniest movie it could be.  DUE DATE tries too hard, and the comedy suffers.In the end, I feel the biggest fault of the film is that although we like, as moviegoers, Downey and Galifianakis, we DON'T like their characters.  Downey is kind of a mean and obnoxious guy.  Galifianakis is kind of clueless, annoying and dangerous.  We just don't really care all that much what happens to them.  I laughed a fair amount at the film, and had a good enough time...but I had hoped for much more, so my overriding feeling was disappointment.",3,"Sporadic laughs, but fairly disappointing.",1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,4348,"['PLANES', 'TRAINS', 'AUTOMOBILES', 'new', 'generation', 'far', 'less', 'successful', 'DUE', 'DATE', 'delivers', 'many', 'solid', 'laughs', 'sloppy', 'unmoving.Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'uptight', 'architect', 'working', 'away', 'home', 'Atlanta', 'got', 'ticket', 'fly', 'back', 'home', 'wife', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'scheduled', 'deliver', 'first', 'child', 'just', 'few', 'days', 'Zack', 'Galifianakis', 'strange', 'troublesome', 'guy', 'who', 'utterly', 'up', 'plans', 'two', 'are', 'forced', 'embark', 'road', 'trip', 'country', 'together', 'bid', 'reach', 'California', 'time', '5', 'days', 'should', 'be', 'plenty', 'time', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'frustrating', 'delays', 'way.Galifianakis', 'dreams', 'heading', 'Hollywood', 'come', 'actor', 'even', 'experience', 'coffee', 'can', 'ashes', 'recently', 'deceased', 'father', 'also', 'French', 'bulldog', 'animal', 'just', 'looking', 'Galifianakis', 'havoc', 'everywhere', 'almost', 'everything', 'blissfully', 'unaware', 'as', 'just', 'little', 'simple', 'minded', 'Downey', 'very', 'much', 'straight', 'man', 'victim', 'almost', 'terrible', 'consequences', 'Galifianakis', 'down', 'uptight', 'humorless', 'real', 'misanthrope.The', 'biggest', 'laughs', 'frankly', 'come', 'interplay', 'odd', 'couple', 'dialogue', 'two', 'characters', 'operate', 'such', 'different', 'levels', 'seldom', 'seem', 'be', 'same', 'page', 'are', 'other', 'more', 'slap-sticky', 'laughs', 'car', 'crashes', 'perhaps', 'least', 'likely', 'escape', 'cops', 'lead', 'chase', 'scene', ""'re"", 'ever', 'going', 'see', 'two', 'pros', 'really', 'banter', 'together', 'movie', 'intersperse', 'touching', 'moments', 'mostly', 'revolving', 'memories', 'fathers', 'often', 'highly', 'crude', 'proceedings', 'scenes', 'frankly', 'feel', 'forced', 'clumsy', 'can', 'sort', 'believe', 'Galifianakis', 'odd', 'remembrances', 'deceased', 'dad', 'when', 'Downey', 'abruptly', 'heart', 'almost', 'scene', 'GREMLINS', 'when', 'Phoebe', 'suddenly', 'talks', 'death', 'dad', 'abrupt', 'clumsily', 'written', 'real', 'emotion', 'almost', 'laughable', 'fact', 'Galifianakis', 'wonderful', 'reaction', 'moment', 'thankfully', 'tone', 'right', 'again', 'supporting', 'cast', 'mostly', 'do', 'far', 'best', 'work', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'briefly', 'be', 'hurry', 'get', 'film', 'Danny', 'McBride', 'usual', 'shtick', 'have', 'good', 'line', 'making', 'reservation', 'Chili', 'Juliette', 'Lewis', 'drug', 'dealer', 'given', 'nothing', 'do', 'Michelle', 'Monaghan', 'who', 'was', 'SO', 'good', 'Downey', 'KISS', 'KISS', 'BANG', 'BANG', 'mostly', 'time', 'phone', 'pleading', 'hubby', 'come', 'back', 'ANYONE', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'film', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'simply', 'too', 'hard', 'room', 'notice', 'bothersome', 'things', 'film', 'imply', 'El', 'Paso/Juarez', 'are', 'fairly', 'I-40', 'when', 'fact', 'are', '4', 'hours', 'apart', 'Vehicles', 'are', 'abandoned', 'what', 'DOES', 'happen', 'Range', 'Rover', 'have', 'time', 'wonder', 'them.Director', 'co-writer', 'Todd', 'Phillips', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'HANGOVER', 'gave', 'annoying', 'characters', 'grew', 'like', 'movie', 'tied', 'loose', 'ends', 'heck', 'entire', 'thing', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'tying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'was', 'obscene', 'times', 'was', 'always', 'funny', 'DUE', 'DATE', 'frequently', 'obscene', 'cringe-inducing', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'showing', 'characters', 'drugs', 'do', ""n't"", 'moviemakers', 'get', 'extended', 'sequences', 'showing', 'character', ""n't"", 'do', 'drugs', 'getting', 'stoned', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'funny', 'loose', 'ends', 'everywhere', 'HANGOVER', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'touching', 'moments', 'just', 'tried', 'be', 'funniest', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'DUE', 'DATE', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'comedy', 'suffers.In', 'end', 'feel', 'biggest', 'fault', 'film', 'like', 'moviegoers', 'Downey', 'Galifianakis', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'like', 'characters', 'Downey', 'kind', 'mean', 'obnoxious', 'guy', 'Galifianakis', 'kind', 'clueless', 'annoying', 'dangerous', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'that', 'much', 'what', 'laughed', 'fair', 'amount', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'enough', 'time', 'had', 'hoped', 'much', 'more', 'overriding', 'feeling', 'was', 'disappointment']",N/A

Ethan is a well meaning, but clumsy, irritating buffoon and his entry into Peter's life starts a chain of events that will leave them irrevocably bonded, but it won't be an easy ride by any stretch of the imagination.This film had a few funny moments that raised a chuckle, but generally I found it to be a rather dry affair. The chemistry between Downey Jr and Galifianakis seemed lacking and whilst the extras gag reel showed them having a good time during filming, this didn't translate onto the screen. Juliette Lewis' brief appearance was one of the highlights of the film and her performance was as good as we have come to expect from her. The direction was average at best with nothing especially note-worthy and the best part of this film was probably the soundtrack which features Neil Young, Band of Horses and Pink Floyd.All in all this is an ok comedy film, but the laughs are few and far between and whilst it isn't the worst film I've ever seen, it is nowhere near the best either.

1302912,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002ZG97II,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[7, 14]","""Due Date"" is a hugely disappointing film. Todd Phillip's follow-up to ""The Hangover"", one of the funniest films in recent memory, relies on an oft-copied formula and the basic conceit that everyone in the story is one-dimensional and pretty stupid. These two problems add up to ""create"" (har, har!) a miserable little film experience.Peter Highman (Robert Downey, Jr.) is an architect currently working on assignment in Atlanta. He and his wife (Michelle Monaghan) are pregnant; Peter  is the type of uptight guy who can come up with a reason to reject everyone of his wife's baby name choices. Scheduled to fly home the next day, Peter has left plenty of cushion for the baby's birth on Friday. But Peter bumps in to Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), literally, as soon as they both arrive at the airport. Before you can say ""Homeland Security"", both men, who are naturally on the same flight to Los Angeles, get bumped off the flight and further circumstances conspire to keep them grounded. They end up sharing a rental car for the long drive from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Or Hollywood as Ethan, an actor headed to an important audition, keeps referring to it.This film should've been called ""Planes, Automobiles and even more Automobiles"". How many times can they remake the seminal John Hughes film? In fact, if I remember correctly, Steve Martin also played an architect. I guess in Hollywood-speak, architect equals uptight and anal which is a necessary trait for one half of the duo to make this concept work. At least, it is necessary if you want to put as little thought as possible into the creation of a film.Downey is basically the straight man. Because he is so uptight and anal, every moment Peter and Ethan are on the road, confined together is a rental car, will test him, making him wince, cringe or get inpatient. In a better film, most of these moments would be new and original. In ""Due Date"", many of these moments seem recycled, often from earlier moments. And this just makes the movie seem longer and more problematic.As the straight man, Downey simply has to react to Galifianakis' shenanigans. But to make Peter work, we have to like his character. Or at least care about him. But because all he does is react, usually in mean ways, to his road trip partner, we never have the chance or a reason to give a flying fig about the uptight architect. Granted, Ethan does extremely annoying things, but because we don't care about Peter, his tormentor seems like a saint.Galifianakis comes closest to making us care about this stereotype than anyone has come since John Candy. He has the same sort of nave innocence about him, a certain clueless, endearing quality that helps us learn to care about him, no matter how stupid he may be. He first appears wearing a Lilith Fair t-shirt, a scarf and pants that may be two sizes too small. Then, we notice his perm (as do many others they interact with). His oddball appearance seems sweet and natural for his character. But this quality quickly wears thin and he often simply becomes annoying; Part of the reason for this is his decisions seem so random. This trait also robs Ethan of any empathy/ Because he is so annoying, when he does do something amusing, we can't see it or enjoy it.Practically everything in this film that is supposed to be funny happens because every character excercises no common sense. Without even the smallest bit of reality, we can't identify with anyone and nothing is funny. For instance, when Peter moves through security at the Atlanta airport, he is stopped for a search and the TSA agent (RZA) finds a marijuana pipe in his bag. After a brief exchange, we next join up with Peter on the airplane as everyone else is boarding. Huh? In what world?In addition to RZA, Juliette Lewis, Danny McBride and Jamie Foxx pop up for brief cameos. Because of the nature of this film, Peter and Ethan traveling cross-country, they will meet and interact with people, but these interactions will be brief. The filmmakers include these moments to put a new obstacle in the path of the main characters, to infuse some new humor into the story. But these moments are, as stated, brief, and in ""Due Date"", none of them work. ""Borat"" is a recent, better example of this same idea.I'm not sure why someone like Jamie Foxx would do such a small, insignificant role. He is a better and funnier actor than this material. What does it do for his career? Fill some time, pay for a small portion of his house? I don't get it.However, for RZA, Lewis and McBride, their participation makes sense. Each gets a moment, hopefully a funny showcase in the new film by the director of ""The Hangover"". If the cameo works, maybe a career is resurrected, more work is offered. Guys, I wouldn't count on anything coming from your participation in this project.Maybe the worst problem with ""Due"" is it just has no new ideas. It even seems to run out of stean and they begin to recycle confrontations and ideas from earlier in the film.If ""Due Date"" were funny, all of this could be forgiven. Every year, the best dramas receive the highest praise and the most awards. But as any comedian will tell you, making a good comedy is a very hard thing to do. When they work, they should receive equal praise. Given the number of truly funny films we get to see every year, this theory would seem to be true. Something, somewhere wasn't clicking during the production of ""Due Date"". Making a good comedy is very hard indeed.",1,Recycled And Unfunny,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",2010,5481,"['Due', 'Date', 'hugely', 'disappointing', 'film', 'Todd', 'Phillip', 'follow-up', 'Hangover',

1302914,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B002ZG97II,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[1, 1]","Due Date has been receiving quite a bit of mixed reviews since its release; it seems viewers either love it or hate it. Obviously Due Date is not The Hangover and it was never going to be, it's very different. Both movies have the same director and Galiafinakis acts in both movies but it shouldn't be seen as anything close to a sequel to The Hangover (in fact a sequel to that movie will be in theaters on May 26), it's a movie on its own. I found the unlikely pairing of Downey Jr. and Galifianakis to be a very effective one; in fact they almost complete each other by the end of the film. Both actors are so different but they go together really well and this makes for some funny situations. It seems some reviewers have a strong hate for this movie, I understand that it's not an excellent movie but it does have its moments and there are far worse movies than Due Date. I just don't get why some say it's the worst movie ever made, that's more than a bit harsh.Architect Peter Highman (Downey Jr.) is headed home to Los Angeles to attend the birth of his first child. Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis) is headed to Hollywood in order to become an actor and hopefully star in Two and a Half Men . The two meet as they are about to take the same flight and Ethan manages to get them both on the no-fly list. Ethan offers Peter a ride home and Peter has seemingly no choice but to accept and must overlook his hatred of Ethan during the trip. With the two characters being almost complete opposites there is bound to be some difficulties. Some situations in the film really are over the top but it's only a movie and its part of the fun. I certainly like the road trip aspect, we get to see beautiful scenery like the Grand Canyon. There's definitely some slapstick humor in the film and obviously some things that won't seem funny to every viewer (masturbating dog is comes to mind) and some will find it totally stupid and pointless.I appreciated and enjoyed Due Date or what it was, a mindless fun movie. It wasn't meant to be a sequel to The Hangover, I think some viewers had the wrong idea of what to expect before watching and in the end maybe that hurt their perspective on Due Date. As I said earlier, this is by no means a great movie but it's an enjoyable one that has its moments. I don't regret watching it and I did find it funny.

Much like ""The Hangover"" this movie was a series of bad luck after bad luck.  This one though very funny was also very touching in many parts.  I will say that this movie does have what I call the ""Hype Syndrome"".  This means that the longer it takes to watch it, the more you hear about it and when you finally do it's built up so much it's not as good as you were expecting.  It is really funny, don't get me wrong.  I just think I would have liked it more if I haven't seen the preview for it 10 times a day (which about 75% of the funniest parts are in), and heard that it was the funniest movie ever.  Not really a new idea, two guys who don't know each other (one neat & one a slob) get stuck together for an extended amount of time.  But the two actors give it new life and it's fun to watch the two opposites play off each other.  I recommend it but tone down your expectations.

It was effectively used in John Hughes-directed ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"" with Steve Martin and John Candy. Part mismatched-buddy movie, part road movie, ""Due Date"" directed by Todd Phillips (""Road Trip"" ""Hangover"") employs the same format. The difference is the jokes are cruder, even violent, including masturbation, gunshot and car crashes (twice).Because of a series of misunderstanding Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) is put on a ""no fly"" list. Stranded in Atlanta, Peter has to come back to LA, where his pregnant wife Sarah (Michelle Monaghan) waits for him in hospital. With only five days to the due date, Peter has to hurry, so the high-strung architect reluctantly hitches a ride with Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), a wannabe actor and avid fan of ""Two and a Half Men."" The problem is that everything Ethan (and his dog) does irritates Peter during the following cross-country ride.Jokes are hit and miss - it depends on you - and though I enjoyed watching the film, I thought it was not as good as the same director's ""Hangover"" not because of the nature of the jokes - I like crude jokes - but because of the casting. I am not completely sure Robert Downey Jr. is the right choice for the role. Talented as he is, he seems a bit too ""in character,"" making some of the scenes too serious. His ""unlikable"" character of Peter IS really unlikable at some points.Cameos from Jamie Foxx, Juliette Lewis, Danny McBride and RZA are mildly amusing, but not surprising as in ""Hangover.""
