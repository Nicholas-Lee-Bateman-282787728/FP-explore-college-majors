""Hard Days Night"" the most irreverant, but the second had no reason, leaving ""Let It Be"" being the saddest. George gave himself to East Indian religion which may haven given you the opportunity to see the music through Eric Clapton and such. But John was not given the easy road. He was political and the government came down on him about being forced to leave the USA. The ""out"" was to settle the taxes with a concert. Hence, this DVD. He's an angry John Lennon and Yoko was not warmly welcomed as she has had a hard time ever being.

1443375,A199T3IWULDX68,B0055V0K5Y,"Thirty-Ought Six ""music fiend""","[6, 6]","Outside of John performing with Elton John for a couple of numbers at MSG in '74, this 1972 performance was a benefit concert and was Lennon's last public performance with Yoko. Coming off the heels of the Sometime in NYC album and using the same band from that record, the setlist is a decent choice of numbers with Come Together thrown in for good measure. The audio is good, but the transfer onto DVD and the synching of audio to video is a disappointment. There is a half a second of pause that occurs every 30 seconds or so of each number and it gets to be annoying, quite frankly. I'm curious if the VHS release suffers from the same fate. I remember this being released a long time ago and I once owned an audio cassette copy of this, but never had the video. Although its nice to have this on DVD, I'm hoping perhaps, this can have a makeover sometime down the road; certainly with today's technology, I can't see why this can't be corrected. 4 stars for content, docked one star because of the &#34;cheap&#34; transfer.",3,"Great piece of history, subpar transfer to video",1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,1028,"['John', 'performing', 'Elton', 'John', 'couple', 'numbers', 'MSG', ""'74"", '1972', 'performance', 'was', 'benefit', 'concert', 'was', 'Lennon', 'last', 'public', 'performance', 'Yoko', 'Coming', 'off', 'heels', 'Sometime', 'NYC', 'album', 'using', 'same', 'band', 'record', 'setlist', 'decent', 'choice', 'numbers', 'Come', 'Together', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'audio', 'good', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'synching', 'audio', 'video', 'disappointment', 'half', 'second', 'pause', '30', 'seconds', 'so', 'number', 'be', 'annoying', 'quite', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'curious', 'VHS', 'release', 'suffers', 'same', 'fate', 'remember', 'being', 'released', 'long', 'time', 'once', 'owned', 'audio', 'cassette', 'copy', 'never', 'had', 'video', 'nice', 'have', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'perhaps', 'can', 'have', 'makeover', 'sometime', 'down', 'road', 'certainly', 'today', 'technology', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'corrected', '4', 'stars', 'content', 'docked', 'one', 'star', '34', 'cheap', '34', 'transfer']",N/A
