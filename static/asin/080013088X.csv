163080,A1YB29BIDULEYE,080013088X,"Bradley Headstone ""Sean ARES Hirsch""","[5, 5]","Basically, this movie is about the struggle between the people who corrupt justice and manipulate it for their own ends, and the people who honesty try to uphold it. Al Pacino is a good honest lawyer, but from the start of the movie, we get the impression that he is nearing the end of his rope (if not already there). (He is basically the opposite of his character in ""The Devil's Advocate."") He is worn down largely due to the fact that he has been trying to get an innocent man out of jail while fighting the corrupt Judge Forsythe. Forsythe seems to believe in keeping with the strict letter of the law, even if it does not uphold the intent of the law. (So, this sets the mood for the movie.)Along the way, Al Pacino tries to help a cross dresser minor felon (Ralph) who messed up, but is not really a dangerous or bad person. Pacino knows that Ralph is sorry for what he did, and that due to his cross dressing, he will never survive if he ends up in jail.Along the way, Judge Forsythe is arrested for rape, and literally comes crawling to Al Pacino for help. With just a bit of intelligence, we can see that he wants Pacino to defend him because Pacino has no political ties, and he has a reputation for being honest. Because of Pacino's hatred for Forsythe, he is reluctant, but Pacino eventually strikes a deal with him. Pacino will defend him if Forsythe allows Pacino a chance to get an innocent man out of jail.The movie continues to attack certain aspects of the justice system such as overly light punishments, or plea bargaining that should have been given some more thought. Craig T. Nelson as the DA is an interesting character. He seems to be on the egotistical side, but he does express the intent of the movie at times: ""People are getting pi..ed at the law, and I have a chance to change that.""Another interestingly complex  character is the suicidal judge Jack Warden. For the most part, he seems to be a decent judge who wants to carry out the law. But throughout the movie, he tries to kill himself several times. (Perhaps the movie is sympathetic to him in that he is trying to uphold fairness in a chaotic world.)Al Pacino gradually sees his world crumble before him, and this is topped off by his finding that his client Forsythe may really be guilty of raping a young woman. The movie ends with a great passage on the flaw of the justice system: ""Both sides want to win, regardless of the truth.""This movie is a real masterpiece that explores not only problems with the justice system, but corruption and deception as well.",5,Corruption and Deception Vs Integrity,1214956800,"07 2, 2008",2008,2551,"['Basically', 'movie', 'struggle', 'people', 'who', 'corrupt', 'justice', 'manipulate', 'own', 'ends', 'people', 'who', 'honesty', 'try', 'uphold', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'good', 'honest', 'lawyer', 'start', 'movie', 'get', 'impression', 'nearing', 'end', 'rope', 'not', 'already', 'there', 'basically', 'opposite', 'character', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'worn', 'down', 'largely', 'due', 'fact', 'been', 'trying', 'get', 'innocent', 'man', 'jail', 'fighting', 'corrupt', 'Judge', 'Forsythe', 'Forsythe', 'believe', 'keeping', 'strict', 'letter', 'law', 'even', 'not', 'uphold', 'intent', 'law', 'So', 'mood', 'movie', 'way', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'help', 'cross', 'dresser', 'minor', 'felon', 'Ralph', 'who', 'messed', 'up', 'not', 'really', 'dangerous', 'bad', 'person', 'Pacino', 'Ralph', 'sorry', 'what', 'did', 'due', 'cross', 'dressing', 'will', 'never', 'survive', 'up', 'jail.Along', 'way', 'Judge', 'Forsythe', 'arrested', 'rape', 'literally', 'crawling', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'help', 'just', 'bit', 'intelligence', 'can', 'see', 'Pacino', 'defend', 'Pacino', 'political', 'ties', 'reputation', 'being', 'honest', 'Pacino', 'hatred', 'Forsythe', 'reluctant', 'Pacino', 'eventually', 'deal', 'Pacino', 'will', 'defend', 'Forsythe', 'Pacino', 'chance', 'get', 'innocent', 'man', 'jail.The', 'movie', 'attack', 'certain', 'aspects', 'justice', 'system', 'such', 'overly', 'light', 'punishments', 'plea', 'bargaining', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'more', 'thought', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'DA', 'interesting', 'character', 'be', 'egotistical', 'side', 'express', 'intent', 'movie', 'times', 'People', 'are', 'getting', 'pi..ed', 'law', 'have', 'chance', 'change', 'interestingly', 'complex', 'character', 'suicidal', 'judge', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'most', 'part', 'be', 'decent', 'judge', 'who', 'carry', 'out', 'law', 'movie', 'kill', 'several', 'times', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'sympathetic', 'trying', 'uphold', 'fairness', 'chaotic', 'world', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'gradually', 'world', 'crumble', 'topped', 'off', 'finding', 'client', 'Forsythe', 'may', 'really', 'be', 'guilty', 'raping', 'young', 'woman', 'movie', 'great', 'passage', 'flaw', 'justice', 'system', 'sides', 'want', 'win', 'regardless', 'truth', 'movie', 'real', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'only', 'problems', 'justice', 'system', 'corruption', 'deception', 'as', 'well']",N/A

His amazing over-the-top performance in the courtroom scene at the end is what makes this unsympathetic look at our criminal justice system so memorable. However, I agree with other reviewers that the plot is slow at times &amp; the movie wavers uncomfortably between comedy &amp; drama. The humor is at times a little too forced &amp; the disco music doesn't help. One of the things I really enjoyed was seeing the great Lee Strasberg play Pacino's grandfather. Remember Godfather Part 2 when Pacino had Strasberg &quot;taken out&quot;? I only wish they could've made more films together. The great cast also includes John Forsythe (who plays a TOTALLY unlikable villian), &amp; Jack Warden, whose suicidal antics get annoying after a while. Of course, it's Pacino that makes this movie so entertaining &amp; so watchable 25 years later.

I love the way the film can be funny one moment and dramatic the next because thats how life is. Change is a gaurentee no matter how many plans you make. I thought Pacino's work with his co-stars ( Lahti, Warden, Forsythe and Strasberg ) was terrific and the performances with the rest of the actors who played Pacino's friends and fellow attorneys was excellent, and of course the actors who played Pacino's clients. The scenes with Pacino and the homosexual criminal and the young man falsely arrested are just so real and affective.  Everytime I watch this movie I feel good but more importantly 'I feel.'

163089,A2OMJJ05E87NBB,080013088X,E. J. Ludwig,"[1, 1]","Publius, an Amazon reviewer, gave this film a two star rating. He or she wrote, ""Overall, this movie is a good representation of our legal system, but do not be disappointed with the more goofier aspects of the movie. This proves that the movie doesn't take itself that serious, but the question that the movie poses is: does the legal system take itself seriously enough?"" To me, that comment on the movie would justify a five star rating, which is just what I have given the film.You see, the film really shows how the plea bargaining aspects of cases and the technicalities of the law tend to interfere with justice. The legal requirements that the punishment fit the crime are often overridden by the plea bargaining dimension of the system. Further, it is crucial that justice go forward in a timely manner which is not the norm anymore if it ever was. Look at the time that has elapsed since Col. Hasan killed all those folks at Fort Hood, but his trial still hasn't begun. Look at the delays in the prosecution of Khalid Mohammed, mastermind of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. These delays already skew the process away from justice.I was menaced at knife point in Queens, NY about 20 years ago. If found guilty by a jury of his peers, the perpetrator would have received a sentence of one year in jail. In order to avoid the cost of a trial, he was allowed to plead guilty and sentenced to 3 months in jail, but could be released after 6 weeks. The law stipulates that if someone is guilty of threatening another person's life with a weapon he or she should be spending one year in jail. Hence, the administrative aspect of affordability governed the process. Was the result ""justice?"" Obviously, my question is rhetorical.So the comment by the two star critic, Publius, acknowledges that the film brings out this aspect of our system. He or she also asserts that the film is goofy. To this viewer, the goofy aspects of the film, like Al Pacino's partner going crazy and throwing plates, another client committing suicide, and yet another client freaking out in jail and ending up shot by the authorities all highlight and exaggerate the perils of a skewed and corrupt system. The goofy aspects help the film really penetrate the viewer's consciousness which has become desensitized to matters of corruption and lies.Even Al Pacino's flight in a helicopter with some crazy judge played by Jack Warden helps break through a tendency most people have to idealize judges as imbued with wisdom, balance, and probity in matters of law. We fail to realize that some are imbalanced or even crazy, and may be on medications for all sorts of mental problems. In so many ways, we are a deceived people regarding our justice system, as well as many other areas of our lives. We need to wake up. Some wonderful, loving being once said, ""The truth will set you free.""In my opinion, this movie is a step in that direction.If we really want to get free, then we need not only watch this movie, but receive salvation from the One who sets all men free, Christ Jesus.

163095,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,080013088X,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 2]","Al Pacino is perfect for this deranged film about American justice, or rather justice in the United States of America. From the very first words and pictures we know something is rotten in the Republic. Rotten because civil ethics cannot be learned by heart, through rote-learning. Civil ethics have to be learned and implemented in real life. And then we shift to real life and then we fall down from one step to the next, from one ledge to the next, from one terrace to the next, down and down again. Every scene is the negation of some sanity or human right. Let's accumulate some. A black transvestite forced to undress in front of a jail full of sexually deprived and hence perverted males before being locked up with them. A judge who uses a gun in court. A judge who has lunch on a ledge off some balcony at fourth-floor level over the street. A judge who brutalizes and rapes young women. An ethics committee that goes berserk about a lawyer who shaved his head when he heard that the murderer he had saved through some technicality has committed two new murders. A lawyer who betrays his clients and one of them ends up hanging himself. A yound white chap ending in prison, taking hostages in some hospital and being shot dead by some security forces, because of a taillight that did not work on his car and a name that looked like that of a wanted criminal. ETC. ETC. And there will be no end along that line. It is the system that produces this mess by forcing the accused to buy a defense, if they can. And most of the time they can't. So they end up in the can if not on deathrow. The victims of the US judicial system are the poor who cannot afford a lawyer, hence a defense. The time of the  mocking bird  has become even worse, because you cannot count on a good defense from a lawyer committed to you by the system and paid - if what he gets can be called paid - with public money. The accused will end up dead without having had any defense. Dramatic and pathetic ! The very demonstreation that this privatised defense system is the guarantee that justice will not be for all, only for those who will be able to buy a good defense for themselves.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne",5,Help us God!

The closing courtroom scene provided a very strong glimpse and more than a hint of the brilliance to come in Pacino's superior acting ability, as well as a striking and disturbing statement on the justice system.  As billed this was a satire on the world of the courts and while not your normal courtroom film, it contained a revealing and bleak message.  Reviewers who have indicated the incidents in this film were not realistic have much to learn about the inner workings of justice.  This was a dire, but accurate depiction of the inner workings of courthouses all over the land.The cast was filled with an unbelievable array of actors, both new and seasoned, and famous and not-so-famous.  The big-screen debut of Christian Lahti (Gail Packer)was not her best role and not necessarily the best co-star for Pacino; her performance was however adequate.  Jack Warden (Judge Rayford) was comfortable and effective as a gruff old judge with a simultaneous death wish and a zeal for life.  Jeffery Tambor (Jay Porter) gave a compelling performance as Pacino's partner pushed to a mental breaking point by the unfortunate outcome of a case where as an attorney Porter did what an attorney is paid to do.  The late Robert Christian's (Ralph Agee) performance as a cross-dressing client was perhaps one of the best in the film; heartbreaking and very real.  John Forsythe (Judge Henry Fleming), post 'Charlie's Angels' and 'Bachelor Father', but pre-'Dynasty' was smug and hard-nosed as both Pacino's courthouse adversary and deviant client.  Craig T. Nelson (Frank Bowers), perhaps best known as Coach Hayden Fox, early in his career in this film was the DA Pacino meets in court in the final trial. Larry Bryggman (Warren Fresnell), probably recognized most as Dr. John Dixon of 'As The World Turns', but also a Shakespearean actor, has an important role as a less dedicated and passionate fellow attorney.  Lee Stasberg (Sam Kirkland), famed drama coach to Pacino and so many other great actors, in his final role portrayed Pacino's grandfather in quite a touching and personal manner.  Even Keith Andes (Marvin Bates), star of numerous movies in the 1950s, appeared.  Many other actors appeared in the courthouses and jails of the film, fleshing out the multiple side stories that served to illustrate the injustices of justice.The commentary by Norman Jewison was created from 22-year old memories, but you have to give them credit for providing it, as many of DVDs of older films just skip commentaries or any special features.  The public now looks forward to this personal insider-information about the making of our favorite films, and this one doesn't disappoint given the limitations of time and distance.This films displays the dynamic acting range of Pacino.  While somewhat more low-key in some instances than in many of his later roles, Pacino appears comfortable in his portrayal of a caring, deeply passionate attorney and more than rises to the occasion when that passion is called upon to be displayed.  He handles the humorous side of his role with ease.  Pacino's appearance on David Letterman prior to the recent release of 'Simone' revealed his personal sense of humor and ability to be a very, very funny man.  That innate comedic timing was visible in the role of Attorney Arthur Kirkland.""And Justice For All' uncovers the many broken spokes in the wheels of justice, entertains with humor and pathos, and leaves you with an true understanding of many of the inconsistencies and frustrating bureaucratic quagmires of the legal system that still exist nearly 25 years later.This was a film ahead of its time in regard to its message, and it gave us: Pacino on the edge of greatness; satire at its best; and entertainment that continues to prevail.

However, this movie can be viewed as a satire of the judicial system, and how lawyers really think and act.  This is a clever film that doesn't fail to disappoint.Al Pacino plays, Arthur, a loyal and honest lawyer who starts to question the values and morals of the judicial system.  Along the way, an ill-tempered judge who hates everything about Arthur is charged with sexually assaulting a young woman.  Although Arthur knows the man is guilty, he knows that if he does not represent the judge, he'll be debarred.  This movie is not about the complete trial; it's about events and situations which lead up to the first day of court, and the outcome is explosive.This is a great movie with unbelievable talent.  Jack Warden does a tremendous job as playing an alcoholic and suicidal judge who fires his gun in the courtroom to get everyone's attention.  Pacino does not disappoint at all, and fills the movie with passion in his acting.  Although this movie isn't really a comedy, I view it as a satire of the judicial system.

You hear children saying the pledge of allegiance in comically childish voices while empty courtrooms and hallways dissolve by, and it seems good, but then the music starts. Either the director should have fired the score composer, or the director should have been fired for allowing that score. It was an intensely 80s (even though this was made in 1979) soft-jazz that, at first, made me worried that this movie would be an entirely lighter movie than it detailed on the back, and then later just didn't fit the movie at all. It was also bad music in the first place, which made it rather annoying.Furthermore, this was shot in that 70s/80s color that makes everything look soft, except the filmmakers were obviously trying for a hard, gritty look at times. I don't know much about what type of film-stock was available at the time, but considering I've seen quite a few movies from the time period that were capable of really taking over that soft, fuzzy look and either using it well or reversing it completely, it shows that maybe the cinematographer wasn't exactly at the top of his game at the time. That said, some rather great, albeit obvious, shots were used to pretty good effect from time to time. I think what gets me about this movie is that the usual bland imagery made the really good shots seem too blatantly symbolically obvious, almost like you wanted to say to the cinematographer, ""Yeah yeah yeah, I see, bars fall across his face, and this movie is about Justice. Woo.""I guess I don't really even need to say that this movie is about justice, considering that justice is in the title, everything the characters talk about is justice, it's set in the judicial system about a man named Arthur (Pacino) as a lawyer, yadayadayada. What's interesting about the writing, though, is that it does two major things: 1) It tries to paint a tragic, dark picture of the judicial system via a series of mistrials, corrupt officials, mistaken identities, and about every court-screw up you can possibly think of, and 2) It simultaneously tries to be a surreal dark-humor piece, something kind of Gilliam-esque.Now considering the bad choice of music and the bad choice of cinematography, I wonder seriously if the direction really fit the writing. However, I can't really be sure, because the writing is so incredibly random. The crazy surreality thrown in amongst the gritty realism really confuses the viewer and makes the movie a bit unclear about what it was really trying to do.Now two explanations come to mind about this. The first is that the direction just simply didn't fit the writing and thus resulted in an odd combination conceits. The second is that the director saw the writing was really impenetrable in said way, and thus did his best to make it work. Two writers worked on the script. Maybe the second one was called in because the director wanted a different tone to the movie, or maybe the two writers just had such different outlooks on what they're doing, the director tried to include both. In one instance, the director is bad, in another, he's really commendable for at least making it work. I don't really know what to think about it.That said, it isn't like this movie is entirely bad. The acting is incredible. The story is very engaging at the least and really takes the time to knock the audience across the head a few times. Al Pacino was nominated for an Oscar for this role, and I don't know exactly what he lost it to, but if he had won it, it would have been well deserved.It is a good enough movie that I actually would have no qualms about including it in my DVD collection, and because of the sort of oddness of exposition, it's hard not to want to watch the movie again just to have some idea of what to expect.--PolarisDiB",4,"Weird Mix, but good nonetheless",1126915200,"09 17, 2005",2005,3844,"['comment', 'spoilers', 'Initially', ""n't"", 'start', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'hear', 'children', 'saying', 'pledge', 'allegiance', 'comically', 'childish', 'voices', 'empty', 'courtrooms', 'hallways', 'dissolve', 'good', 'then', 'music', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'fired', 'score', 'composer', 'director', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fired', 'allowing', 'score', 'was', 'intensely', '80s', 'even', 'was', 'made', '1979', 'soft-jazz', 'first', 'made', 'worried', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'entirely', 'lighter', 'movie', 'detailed', 'back', 'then', 'later', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'bad', 'music', 'first', 'place', 'made', 'rather', 'annoying.Furthermore', 'was', 'shot', '70s/80s', 'color', 'everything', 'look', 'soft', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'obviously', 'trying', 'hard', 'gritty', 'look', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'what', 'type', 'film-stock', 'was', 'available', 'time', 'considering', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'movies', 'time', 'period', 'were', 'capable', 'really', 'taking', 'over', 'soft', 'fuzzy', 'look', 'using', 'well', 'reversing', 'completely', 'maybe', 'cinematographer', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'top', 'game', 'time', 'said', 'rather', 'great', 'albeit', 'obvious', 'shots', 'were', 'used', 'pretty', 'good', 'effect', 'time', 'time', 'think', 'what', 'movie', 'usual', 'bland', 'imagery', 'made', 'really', 'good', 'shots', 'seem', 'too', 'blatantly', 'symbolically', 'obvious', 'almost', 'wanted', 'say', 'cinematographer', 'Yeah', 'yeah', 'yeah', 'see', 'bars', 'fall', 'face', 'movie', 'Justice', 'Woo', 'guess', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'even', 'need', 'say', 'movie', 'justice', 'considering', 'justice', 'title', 'everything', 'characters', 'talk', 'justice', 'set', 'judicial', 'system', 'man', 'named', 'Arthur', 'Pacino', 'lawyer', 'yadayadayada', 'What', 'interesting', 'writing', 'two', 'major', 'things', '1', 'paint', 'tragic', 'dark', 'picture', 'judicial', 'system', 'series', 'mistrials', 'corrupt', 'officials', 'mistaken', 'identities', 'court-screw', 'can', 'possibly', 'think', '2', 'simultaneously', 'be', 'surreal', 'dark-humor', 'piece', 'something', 'kind', 'Gilliam-esque.Now', 'considering', 'bad', 'choice', 'music', 'bad', 'choice', 'cinematography', 'wonder', 'seriously', 'direction', 'really', 'fit', 'writing', 'However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'sure', 'writing', 'so', 'incredibly', 'random', 'crazy', 'surreality', 'thrown', 'amongst', 'gritty', 'realism', 'really', 'viewer', 'movie', 'bit', 'unclear', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'trying', 'do.Now', 'two', 'explanations', 'come', 'mind', 'first', 'direction', 'just', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'writing', 'thus', 'resulted', 'odd', 'combination', 'conceits', 'second', 'director', 'saw', 'writing', 'was', 'really', 'impenetrable', 'said', 'way', 'thus', 'did', 'best', 'make', 'work', 'Two', 'writers', 'worked', 'script', 'Maybe', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'called', 'director', 'wanted', 'different', 'tone', 'movie', 'maybe', 'two', 'writers', 'just', 'had', 'such', 'different', 'outlooks', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'director', 'tried', 'include', 'one', 'instance', 'director', 'bad', 'really', 'commendable', 'least', 'making', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'what', 'think', 'said', ""n't"", 'movie', 'entirely', 'bad', 'acting', 'incredible', 'story', 'very', 'engaging', 'least', 'really', 'time', 'knock', 'audience', 'head', 'few', 'times', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'lost', 'had', 'won', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'deserved.It', 'good', 'enough', 'movie', 'actually', 'would', 'have', 'qualms', 'including', 'DVD', 'collection', 'sort', 'oddness', 'exposition', 'hard', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'just', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'expect.', 'PolarisDiB']",N/A
163118,A292YWWNFVSIWY,080013088X,Publius,"[0, 2]","""...And justice for all"" is a sometimes accurate, sometimes goofy portrayal of the American justice system.  Sometimes movies that portray the law concentrate on one lawyer and the one case that he must win.  With this movie, Pacino's character (Arthur Kirkland) is swamped with case after case, which is closer to the reality of how a small practice operates.  Pacino's character in this movie is described as idealistic, but like many real-life lawyers his idealism is tempered by a healthy dose of skepticism.  The Arthur Kirkland that chides his friend that ""We are dealing with real people HERE"" is the same lawyer that will not refuse to turn down an accused judge's case because if he does the ethics board will go after him.  An interesting supporting cast complements Pacino here, with Lee Strasberg as Pacino's aging grandfather and Dominic Chianese as one of Pacino's more interesting clients.  In this way, ""And justice for all"" acts as sort of a ""Godfather: Part II"" reunion with both Strasberg and Chianese playing key supporting roles.  Viewing this movie in the early 21st century may be difficult, because the music seems so dated.  The background music is more suited to a early 80's sitcom then a serious movie that wants to examine the legal system.  Pacino's law partner is played by Jeffrey Tambor, who loses his sanity after finding out that a defendant that he got off for murder has killed again.  In a hilarious scene, Tambor begins throwing plates in the halls of the courtroom.  Pacino defends his friend saying that he just needs to be given some time to calm down.  Whether Pacino believes that or not is another question, but it turns out to be true, as the very end of the movie shows.  During the course of the movie, Pacino is thrown in prison for contempt, has to deal with a suicidal judge and defend a guilty judge and contend with the various problems of running a small firm.  All these aspects bear down on him as he delivers one of the most memorable, if ineffective, opening statements in legal film history.  One of the major complaints of this movie is that it does not seem to have a flow or logic to it, but it actually consists of more a collection of snapshots about how the legal system has run amok.  The closing scene changes all this and ties it together with Pacino's character delivering an impassioned jeremiad against the legal process.  Pacino is always his best when delivering long impassioned speeches.  In fact, it won him an Oscar in ""Scent of a Woman"" and here he does the same.

163131,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,080013088X,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[2, 2]","+++++The title of this movie comes from the last four words of the United States Pledge of Allegiance.This is a satire (but not an over-the-top satire) about an ethical defense lawyer named Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino) who by the end of the movie is forced to choose between his legal profession and his basic human decency.The criminal justice system portrayed here (and from what I read in newspapers and books, not very far from reality) is one where criminals go free and non-criminals are jailed, lawyers and judges make deals as a matter of routine, and the innocent sometimes go unprotected.The movie centers on the life of lawyer Arthur Kirkland.  He has a law partner (Jeffrey Tambor) who starts unraveling when a tragedy occurs that he feels he was responsible for.  Arthur is friends with a wacko judge (brilliantly portrayed by Jack Warden) but is on bad terms with a stern but distinguished judge (John Forsythe, who played the voice of ""Charlie"" in the original ""Charlie's Angels"").  As well, Arthur develops a relationship with a female lawyer (Christine Lahti).  On top of all this, he still cares for his elderly grandfather (Lee Stasberg) who put him through law school.We get a glimpse of some interesting cases Arthur is working on but the main case that eventually comes Arthur's way is when the stern judge (mentioned above) who dislikes Arthur asks Arthur (to his surprise) to defend him against allegations that he raped and battered a young girl.  Thus I disagree with the above Amazon editorial review that says this movie is somehow unfocused.  It is very focused and interesting.The movie builds up to a final, explosive courtroom scene.  It is truly unforgettable!Beware that this is a dialogue-driven movie.  If you listen to some of the dialogue carefully, you'll discover what this movie is all about.  One of my favorite pieces of dialogue occurs early in the movie where Arthur says to his grandfather:""Being honest doesn't have much to do with being a lawyer.""Kudos to Al Pacino for giving an unforgettable performance as the young, idealistic lawyer.  I could see why he was nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award.  Jack Warden gives a good, solid performance as the crazy judge.  John Forsythe as the distinguished judge plays a cunning foil to the honest Arthur.  Even Jeffrey Tambor who plays an unraveling lawyer gives an excellent performance.Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2001) is perfect in sound and audio quality.  It has one notable extra.In conclusion, this is truly one terrific movie that will leave you wondering about the justice system!(1979;  2 hr;  full screen;  28 scenes;  rated `R')+++++",5,An Ethical Lawyer vs a Crazy Justice System,1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,2653,"['+++++The', 'title', 'movie', 'last', 'four', 'words', 'United', 'States', 'Pledge', 'Allegiance.This', 'satire', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'satire', 'ethical', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'named', 'Arthur', 'Kirkland', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'who', 'end', 'movie', 'forced', 'choose', 'legal', 'profession', 'basic', 'human', 'decency.The', 'criminal', 'justice', 'system', 'portrayed', 'here', 'what', 'read', 'newspapers', 'books', 'not', 'very', 'far', 'reality', 'one', 'where', 'criminals', 'go', 'free', 'non-criminals', 'are', 'jailed', 'lawyers', 'judges', 'make', 'deals', 'matter', 'routine', 'innocent', 'sometimes', 'go', 'unprotected.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'life', 'lawyer', 'Arthur', 'Kirkland', 'law', 'partner', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'who', 'unraveling', 'when', 'tragedy', 'was', 'responsible', 'Arthur', 'friends', 'wacko', 'judge', 'brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'bad', 'terms', 'stern', 'distinguished', 'judge', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'who', 'played', 'voice', 'Charlie', 'original', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'well', 'Arthur', 'relationship', 'female', 'lawyer', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'top', 'still', 'elderly', 'grandfather', 'Lee', 'Stasberg', 'who', 'put', 'law', 'school.We', 'get', 'glimpse', 'interesting', 'cases', 'Arthur', 'working', 'main', 'case', 'eventually', 'Arthur', 'way', 'when', 'stern', 'judge', 'mentioned', 'who', 'Arthur', 'Arthur', 'surprise', 'defend', 'allegations', 'raped', 'battered', 'young', 'girl', 'Thus', 'disagree', 'above', 'Amazon', 'editorial', 'review', 'movie', 'somehow', 'unfocused', 'very', 'focused', 'interesting.The', 'movie', 'up', 'final', 'explosive', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'truly', 'unforgettable', 'Beware', 'dialogue-driven', 'movie', 'listen', 'dialogue', 'carefully', ""'ll"", 'discover', 'what', 'movie', 'One', 'favorite', 'pieces', 'dialogue', 'occurs', 'early', 'movie', 'where', 'Arthur', 'grandfather', 'Being', 'honest', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'being', 'lawyer', 'Kudos', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'giving', 'unforgettable', 'performance', 'young', 'idealistic', 'lawyer', 'could', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'good', 'solid', 'performance', 'crazy', 'judge', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'distinguished', 'judge', 'cunning', 'foil', 'honest', 'Arthur', 'Even', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'who', 'unraveling', 'lawyer', 'excellent', 'performance.Finally', 'DVD', 'one', 'released', '2001', 'perfect', 'sound', 'audio', 'quality', 'one', 'notable', 'extra.In', 'conclusion', 'truly', 'one', 'terrific', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'wondering', 'justice', 'system', '1979', '2', 'hr', 'full', 'screen', '28', 'scenes', 'rated', 'R', '+++++']",N/A

Nelson, Terri Wooten.Running Time:  119 minutesRated R for language and some violence.There were quite a few of these types of films in the seventies, not really comedies or dramas per se, but a clever mixture of both, and part of the reason that the '70s are regarded by many as the richest era for films & film-making. Another sample which comes to mind is ""Mother, Jugs, and Speed"" - not as good, but comparable. These films point to a darkly humorous take on our existence, usually taking place in modern, contemporary times, and in an urban setting. In this one, the legal - justice system is targeted; it's the system we supposedly depend on and which elevates our nation (the U.S.) above the rabble of the world. But the way it's examined here, the system doesn't really work. It's geared towards those with the power (read: money) and most of those incarcerated, it seems to say, are there by an awful whim of fate. Most lawyers (Pacino plays a particularly compassionate one) function merely to make the suffering of these innocents a bit less grueling, through kissing the butts of hard-line judges (Forsythe is a particularly mean one).The film opens with Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino) spending the night in ""the can"" for contempt of court for taking a swing at Judge Flemings (John Forsythe) who was presiding on a case that Arthur had before his bench.  Having to face a review board to see if he's fit to be a lawyer and facing possible disbarment, Arthur starts to wonder if all the work that he put into going through law school and in passing the Maryland State Bar to become a member of the law profession was really worth it.  With his career on the line Arthur is suddenly given the job to defend the very Judge who would want nothing better then to have him disbarred Judge Henry T. Fleming. Accused of assault battery and rape of a local call girl Leah Shepard (Terri Wooten), it turns out that Arthur is the best person to defend the judge since it would prove that even he, who hates Flaming with a vengeance, has to defend his client to the best of his ability.It's a one-sided view, to be sure, that we have here: those who are truly guilty, such as child-killers, get released on technicalities and proceed to murder the next day, causing at least for one lawyer (Tambor) a spin down to a nervous breakdown. Do such things really happen in real life? Surely. But, here it's de rigueur, as if looking at the world through a funhouse mirror, a sly distortion. It's amusing to view this satire on our society's ills and we can laugh, with a bit of discomfort, at a picture of what passes for rule of law or justice. But it's probably more gratifying to see Pacino, Warden and the rest acting their best, mostly 'New York-style' (though this takes place in Baltimore). Pacino's character really shouldn't be a lawyer; he feels too much and is a genuine human being, where as everyone else is caught up in the abstracts of winning in the system. Even Pacino's new girlfriend (Lahti in her first movie role), though appearing sympathetic to his dilemmas, is just another cog in the system. When he explains his biggest problem to her in the last act, instead of heartfelt advice, she gives him a list of options, as if she was his, well, lawyer.  Pacino's all alone in this picture. All his peers have enclosed themselves in callous shells. His only outlet, a grandpa (acting teacher Strasberg) is moving steadily into senility. His stand-in father-judge (Warden) is literally giving in to the craziness. It all points to the thrilling finale of Pacino's opening statement during the climactic trial. Where in action pictures it usually points to a thrilling final battle, in this type of picture it's a thrilling monologue by the main actor. Pacino's all alone up there and his rendition is worth the price of admission by itself.  Oftentimes hilarious and full of sadness the next, a superb satire with mesmerizing performances and a smart script.",4,...And Justice For All (1979),1151884800,"07 3, 2006",2006,4126,"['Director', 'Norman', 'JewisonCast', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'Lee', 'Strasberg', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'Sam', 'Levene', 'Robert', 'Christian', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Terri', 'Wooten.Running', 'Time', '119', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'language', 'violence.There', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'types', 'films', 'seventies', 'not', 'really', 'comedies', 'dramas', 'se', 'clever', 'mixture', 'part', 'reason', ""'70s"", 'are', 'regarded', 'many', 'richest', 'era', 'films', 'film-making', 'sample', 'mind', 'Mother', 'Jugs', 'Speed', 'not', 'good', 'comparable', 'films', 'point', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'take', 'existence', 'usually', 'taking', 'place', 'modern', 'contemporary', 'times', 'urban', 'setting', 'one', 'legal', 'justice', 'system', 'targeted', 'system', 'supposedly', 'depend', 'nation', 'U.S.', 'rabble', 'world', 'way', 'examined', 'here', 'system', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'geared', 'towards', 'power', 'read', 'money', 'most', 'incarcerated', 'say', 'are', 'there', 'awful', 'whim', 'fate', 'Most', 'lawyers', 'Pacino', 'particularly', 'compassionate', 'one', 'function', 'merely', 'make', 'suffering', 'innocents', 'bit', 'less', 'grueling', 'kissing', 'butts', 'hard-line', 'judges', 'Forsythe', 'particularly', 'mean', 'one', '.The', 'film', 'Arthur', 'Kirkland', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'spending', 'night', 'can', 'contempt', 'court', 'taking', 'swing', 'Judge', 'Flemings', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'who', 'was', 'presiding', 'case', 'Arthur', 'had', 'bench', 'Having', 'face', 'review', 'board', 'see', 'fit', 'be', 'lawyer', 'facing', 'possible', 'disbarment', 'Arthur', 'wonder', 'work', 'put', 'going', 'law', 'school', 'passing', 'Maryland', 'State', 'Bar', 'become', 'member', 'law', 'profession', 'was', 'really', 'worth', 'career', 'line', 'Arthur', 'suddenly', 'given', 'job', 'defend', 'very', 'Judge', 'who', 'would', 'want', 'nothing', 'better', 'then', 'have', 'disbarred', 'Judge', 'Henry', 'T.', 'Fleming', 'Accused', 'assault', 'battery', 'rape', 'local', 'call', 'girl', 'Leah', 'Shepard', 'Terri', 'Wooten', 'out', 'Arthur', 'best', 'person', 'defend', 'judge', 'would', 'prove', 'even', 'who', 'Flaming', 'vengeance', 'defend', 'client', 'best', 'ability.It', 'one-sided', 'view', 'be', 'sure', 'have', 'here', 'who', 'are', 'truly', 'guilty', 'such', 'child-killers', 'get', 'released', 'technicalities', 'proceed', 'murder', 'next', 'day', 'causing', 'least', 'one', 'lawyer', 'Tambor', 'down', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'Do', 'such', 'things', 'really', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'Surely', 'here', 'de', 'rigueur', 'looking', 'world', 'funhouse', 'mirror', 'sly', 'distortion', 'amusing', 'view', 'satire', 'society', 'ills', 'can', 'laugh', 'bit', 'discomfort', 'picture', 'what', 'rule', 'law', 'justice', 'probably', 'more', 'gratifying', 'see', 'Pacino', 'Warden', 'rest', 'acting', 'best', 'mostly', 'York-style', 'place', 'Baltimore', 'Pacino', 'character', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'lawyer', 'too', 'much', 'genuine', 'human', 'being', 'where', 'everyone', 'else', 'caught', 'up', 'abstracts', 'winning', 'system', 'Even', 'Pacino', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Lahti', 'first', 'movie', 'role', 'appearing', 'sympathetic', 'dilemmas', 'just', 'cog', 'system', 'When', 'biggest', 'problem', 'last', 'act', 'instead', 'heartfelt', 'advice', 'list', 'options', 'was', 'well', 'lawyer', 'Pacino', 'alone', 'picture', 'peers', 'have', 'enclosed', 'callous', 'shells', 'only', 'outlet', 'grandpa', 'acting', 'teacher', 'Strasberg', 'moving', 'steadily', 'senility', 'stand-in', 'father-judge', 'Warden', 'literally', 'giving', 'craziness', 'points', 'thrilling', 'finale', 'Pacino', 'opening', 'statement', 'climactic', 'trial', 'Where', 'action', 'pictures', 'usually', 'thrilling', 'final', 'battle', 'type', 'picture', 'thrilling', 'monologue', 'main', 'actor', 'Pacino', 'alone', 'there', 'rendition', 'price', 'admission', 'hilarious', 'full', 'sadness', 'next', 'superb', 'satire', 'mesmerizing', 'performances', 'smart', 'script']",N/A

163138,A16BUYFD7R4QMI,080013088X,"Vincent Tesi ""Vinny""","[5, 5]","Al Pacino's  eight minute grandstand that concludes And Jusice For All is one of the actor's most emotional and powerful performances ever captured on film.  Pacino's  tirade against a corrupt judicial system filled with  inside deals is a representative statement for the underpriviledged and  middle class who often do not have the financial resources or the political  connections to achieve false innocence.  When watching Pacino's oratory  expose, I felt energized, empowered, and exalted that the underside of our  legal system was revealed. It did not matter if the film's technical  accuracy to proper courtroom and legal protocol was not strictly adhered  to.  The film's societal message of a dual system of justice, one for the  rich and one for the poor, over-rides any cinimatic deficiencies in  portraying accurate court procedings.  The film focuses not on what  transpires before clients,lawyers,judges, and the jury in an overt  courtroom, but rather what occurs behind closed doors.  Pacino's  frustation, anger, and, salvation burn through his closing courtroom salvo.  His emotions are sensitized when tears emerge during his fiery outburst.  Pacino has never been better. Only Pacino's similar climatic defense of  Matt Damon in Scent of A Women matches the intensity of this performance.  The film's camera work, editing, script, and direction may not be cinematic  wonders. But the film's message and Pacino's emotional performance  overwhelm the viewer.  The film's ending shows that justice (Hollywood's  concept anyway) is indiscriminate.",4,"Courtroom Insanity, Dealmaking , As Only Pacino Can Deliver",956102400,"04 19, 2000",2000,1564,"['Al', 'Pacino', 'eight', 'minute', 'grandstand', 'Jusice', 'All', 'one', 'actor', 'most', 'emotional', 'powerful', 'performances', 'ever', 'captured', 'film', 'Pacino', 'tirade', 'corrupt', 'judicial', 'system', 'filled', 'inside', 'deals', 'representative', 'statement', 'underpriviledged', 'middle', 'class', 'who', 'often', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'financial', 'resources', 'political', 'connections', 'achieve', 'false', 'innocence', 'When', 'watching', 'Pacino', 'oratory', 'expose', 'felt', 'energized', 'empowered', 'exalted', 'underside', 'legal', 'system', 'was', 'revealed', 'did', 'not', 'matter', 'film', 'technical', 'accuracy', 'proper', 'courtroom', 'legal', 'protocol', 'was', 'not', 'strictly', 'adhered', 'film', 'societal', 'message', 'dual', 'system', 'justice', 'one', 'rich', 'one', 'poor', 'over-rides', 'cinimatic', 'deficiencies', 'portraying', 'accurate', 'court', 'procedings', 'film', 'not', 'what', 'clients', 'lawyers', 'judges', 'jury', 'overt', 'courtroom', 'rather', 'what', 'behind', 'closed', 'doors', 'Pacino', 'frustation', 'anger', 'salvation', 'burn', 'closing', 'courtroom', 'salvo', 'emotions', 'are', 'sensitized', 'when', 'tears', 'emerge', 'fiery', 'outburst', 'Pacino', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'Only', 'Pacino', 'similar', 'climatic', 'defense', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Scent', 'A', 'Women', 'intensity', 'performance', 'film', 'camera', 'work', 'editing', 'script', 'direction', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cinematic', 'wonders', 'film', 'message', 'Pacino', 'emotional', 'performance', 'viewer', 'film', 'ending', 'justice', 'Hollywood', 'concept', 'anyway', 'indiscriminate']",N/A
163139,AQP1VPK16SVWM,080013088X,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[13, 15]","Please note: This review is ONLY for the 2008 re-release. If you are reading this and it is under the 2001 release, this review is not for that edition and amazon.com has grouped it together.It's amazing watching Al Pacino chew the scenery. Norman Jewison's dramatic satire of the judicial system ""...And Justice For All"" has plenty for Pacino to chew on along with his co-stars Jeffrey Tambor, Jack Warden, Lee Strasberg, Craig T. Nelson and Christine Lahti (in one of her first major screen roles). Pacino manages to get every morsel of nutrition out of a scene. The meaty script allows Pacino's co-stars to equal him scene for scene which is perfect for a dramatic satire of this sort.Opening with images of an empty court house with children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, ""And Justice for All"" represents a satire as broad and powerful as ""Network"" in eviscerating the justice system as that other film did TV. Pacino plays attorney Arthur Kirkland the type of attorney who becomes very involved in his client's cases going to bat for them in a big way or in this case providing a knock out punch worthy of a boxing match. For example when we first meet him he's in lock up on a contempt charge for hitting a corrupt judge (John Forsythe) when he didn't agree with his decision. As luck would have it (or karma depending on your point of view), the very same judge has been charged with the rape of a young girl. He turns to Kirkland because he realizes that the attorney is passionate about his cases and that their adversarial relationship will prevent any later charges of a cover up. Kirkland has to overcome his distaste for the judge and manage a trial that could make or break what's left of his legal career.A marked improvement over the first edition from 2001 which had plenty of analog imperfections and didn't look much better than a top notch high quality VHS transfer, the colors are more accurate and the film has much better detail and sharpness. Keep in mind that this is a film made in 1979 so you are going to see grain (it was shot on a grainy film stock to begin with)and it's not going to pop like a film from 2008 but that's also part of the charm of this classic. It looks exactly how it should.Audio hasn't been remixed for 5.1 and is still in the original mono. It is a slight improvement over the original audio with slightly better clarity and dialogue coming through clearly but it still sounds flat without much depth.Be aware that part of this digital clean up and remaster may have been prepared for the Blu-ray that will eventually hit the street. If you have a Blu-ray player you may want to wait to see if it does, indeed, street some time in the immediate future.The extras for this edition are a marked improvement over the 2001 release, we get the original commentary by Norman Jewison ported over for this edition. It's a fun and involving commentary and it's clear that Jewison is enjoying watching the film as much as we are.We also get a pair of extremely good interviews with director Jewison and co-writer Barry Levinson discussing the making of the film. Jewison is always a joy to listen to and he relates a story about Lahti first being cast. Jewison liked her and was hesitant about putting in the film because she's taller than Pacino (quite a bit actually) and he didn't know how Pacino would feel about it. He saw her performance and thought she was brilliant so he insisted that she be in the film.We also get a preview for Pacino's new film ""88 Minutes"", the original theatrical trailer and deleted scenes.  As an additional promotional move Sony has included the acclaimed pilot for the excellent legal drama ""Damages"". As to how ""Damages"" looks you'll have to read my review of that TV show.Finally we get previews for ""Close Encounters: The Special Edition"" which features all three versions of the film as well as a huge assortment of extras (you'll have to read my review of that set to get an insight into what is included, etc.) and ""Taxi Driver: Special Collector's Edition"". The latter preview is presented in a modern, annoyingly edited format with an annoying dance score that has absolutely nothing to do with the film itself. I suppose they are trying to suck in the younger crowd who have never seen one of De Niro's finest and most disturbing performances (and that's saying quite a bit). Finally we get a preview for the contemporary underrated thriller ""We Own the Night"".A marked improvement over the 2001 release of ""...And Justice For All"", this edition looks better and comes loaded. I can highly recommend this digitally remastered classic.",5,Classic dramatic satire finally gets deluxe edition it deserves with plenty of extras...,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,4624,"['Please', 'note', 'review', 'ONLY', '2008', 're-release', 'are', 'reading', '2001', 'release', 'review', 'not', 'edition', 'amazon.com', 'grouped', 'amazing', 'watching', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'chew', 'scenery', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'dramatic', 'satire', 'judicial', 'system', 'Justice', 'All', 'plenty', 'Pacino', 'chew', 'co-stars', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'Lee', 'Strasberg', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Christine', 'Lahti', 'one', 'first', 'major', 'screen', 'roles', 'Pacino', 'get', 'morsel', 'nutrition', 'scene', 'meaty', 'script', 'Pacino', 'co-stars', 'equal', 'scene', 'scene', 'perfect', 'dramatic', 'satire', 'sort.Opening', 'images', 'empty', 'court', 'house', 'children', 'reciting', 'Pledge', 'Allegiance', 'Justice', 'All', 'satire', 'broad', 'powerful', 'Network', 'eviscerating', 'justice', 'system', 'other', 'film', 'did', 'TV', 'Pacino', 'attorney', 'Arthur', 'Kirkland', 'type', 'attorney', 'who', 'very', 'involved', 'client', 'cases', 'going', 'bat', 'big', 'way', 'case', 'providing', 'knock', 'out', 'punch', 'worthy', 'boxing', 'match', 'example', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'lock', 'up', 'contempt', 'charge', 'hitting', 'corrupt', 'judge', 'John', 'Forsythe', 'when', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'decision', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'karma', 'depending', 'point', 'view', 'very', 'same', 'judge', 'been', 'charged', 'rape', 'young', 'girl', 'Kirkland', 'attorney', 'passionate', 'cases', 'adversarial', 'relationship', 'will', 'prevent', 'later', 'charges', 'cover', 'up', 'Kirkland', 'overcome', 'distaste', 'judge', 'manage', 'trial', 'could', 'make', 'break', 'what', 'left', 'legal', 'career.A', 'marked', 'improvement', 'first', 'edition', '2001', 'had', 'plenty', 'analog', 'imperfections', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'much', 'better', 'top', 'notch', 'high', 'quality', 'VHS', 'transfer', 'colors', 'are', 'more', 'accurate', 'film', 'much', 'better', 'detail', 'sharpness', 'Keep', 'mind', 'film', 'made', '1979', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'grain', 'was', 'shot', 'grainy', 'film', 'stock', 'begin', 'not', 'going', 'pop', 'film', '2008', 'also', 'part', 'charm', 'classic', 'exactly', 'how', ""n't"", 'been', 'remixed', '5.1', 'still', 'original', 'mono', 'slight', 'improvement', 'original', 'audio', 'slightly', 'better', 'clarity', 'dialogue', 'coming', 'clearly', 'still', 'flat', 'much', 'depth.Be', 'aware', 'part', 'digital', 'clean', 'up', 'remaster', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'prepared', 'Blu-ray', 'will', 'eventually', 'hit', 'street', 'have', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'may', 'want', 'wait', 'see', 'indeed', 'street', 'time', 'immediate', 'future.The', 'extras', 'edition', 'are', 'marked', 'improvement', '2001', 'release', 'get', 'original', 'commentary', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'ported', 'over', 'edition', 'fun', 'involving', 'commentary', 'clear', 'Jewison', 'enjoying', 'watching', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'are.We', 'also', 'get', 'pair', 'extremely', 'good', 'interviews', 'director', 'Jewison', 'co-writer', 'Barry', 'Levinson', 'discussing', 'making', 'film', 'Jewison', 'always', 'joy', 'listen', 'story', 'Lahti', 'first', 'being', 'cast', 'Jewison', 'liked', 'was', 'hesitant', 'putting', 'film', 'taller', 'Pacino', 'quite', 'bit', 'actually', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Pacino', 'would', 'feel', 'saw', 'performance', 'thought', 'was', 'brilliant', 'insisted', 'be', 'film.We', 'also', 'get', 'preview', 'Pacino', 'new', 'film', '88', 'Minutes', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'additional', 'promotional', 'move', 'Sony', 'included', 'acclaimed', 'pilot', 'excellent', 'legal', 'drama', 'Damages', 'how', 'Damages', ""'ll"", 'have', 'read', 'review', 'TV', 'show.Finally', 'get', 'previews', 'Close', 'Encounters', 'Special', 'Edition', 'three', 'versions', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'huge', 'assortment', 'extras', ""'ll"", 'have', 'read', 'review', 'set', 'get', 'insight', 'what', 'included', 'etc', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Special', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'latter', 'preview', 'presented', 'modern', 'annoyingly', 'edited', 'format', 'annoying', 'dance', 'score', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'do', 'film', 'suppose', 'are', 'trying', 'suck', 'younger', 'crowd', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'De', 'Niro', 'finest', 'most', 'disturbing', 'performances', 'saying', 'quite', 'bit', 'Finally', 'get', 'preview', 'contemporary', 'underrated', 'thriller', 'Own', 'Night', '.A', 'marked', 'improvement', '2001', 'release', 'Justice', 'All', 'edition', 'better', 'loaded', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'digitally', 'remastered', 'classic']",N/A
