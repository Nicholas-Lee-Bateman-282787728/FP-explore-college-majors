Lauren Tewes is actually good as the TV anchor-turned Nancy Drew sleuth. Jennifer Jason Leigh (The Hitcher, Single White Female), in her film debut, is very convincing as Tewes' blind sister. John Disanti is perfectly hate-worthy as the rapist/murderer on the hunt for female prey. Tewes' character and her sister live in a highrise apartment building. Little do they know that a serial killer lives in the tower next to theirs (watch for the mirror-image effect to simulate the two buildings)! He goes out nightly, stalking and killing young women. Tewes gets suspicious one evening after seeing the man throwing away his bloody shirt. Of course, no one believes her, so it's up to her to gather evidence against this creep. Unfortunately, the killer finds out who's spying on him! EOAS is a solid killer-thriller w/ a surprising gore quotient. There's a decapitation scene (involving a cleaver and a fishtank) that will send all true goreh&uuml;ndts' hearts aflutter! Yep, lots of the red stuff, but enough suspense to make it all worth while.

337815,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6302814685,calvinnme,"[61, 67]","Someone else has already said which films are in this set, so I will add detailed descriptions of each featured film:From Beyond the Grave (1973) Peter Cushing - 4/5 - Cushing hosts this anthology of four tales that is pretty good if you are a fan of British style horror. The shortness of the four tales keeps things moving along nicely so that you don't get bored. What holds the stories together is that Cushing plays the owner of an antique shop whose customers meet supernaturally tragic fates if they try to wrong him.Someone's Watching Me (1978) - Stars Lauren Hutton and David Birney, directed by John Carpenter - 4/5 - Lauren Hutton is a woman being stalked by a neighbor across from her apartment. He calls her, sends her gifts, and watches her through his telescope. When she can't get the police to take her seriously, she has to take on her tormenter herself along with her boyfriend and a woman that works at the same TV station as she. This is actually a well-done film that was made for TV. The features are:Anamorphic Widescreen PresentationEnglish, French and Spanish MonoEnglish, French and Spanish subtitlesNew Featurette ""John Carpenter: Director Rising""The Hand (1981) - stars Michael Caine, directed by Oliver Stone - 3/5 - The idea is simple enough. Jonathan Lonsdale is a comic book artist whose right hand is severed in a car accident. The hand takes on a life of its own and kills everyone who annoys or wrongs Jon. Although not great, good direction by Stone and good acting by Michael Caine as the tortured artist really save this one. It's not meant to be so much horror as a character study of Lonsdale, and on that level it works. The features are:Anamorphic Widescreen PresentationEnglish and Spanish Dolby SurroundEnglish, French and Spanish subtitlesCommentary by Oliver StoneTheatrical TrailerEyes of a Stranger (1981) - Lauren Tewes and Jennifer Jason Leigh - 2/5 - This is your typical immediate post Jason/Michael Myers kind of slasher movie that was prevalent at the time. Tewes, of ""Loveboat"" fame, is a reporter on the trail of a neighbor that she believes is a serial killer. And of course, what would a 1980 era slasher film be without the helpless girl waiting to be a victim, Jason Leigh, the blind and deaf sister of Tewes. Not very interesting or thrilling at all except for the fact that this is Leigh's film debut. The features are:Anamorphic Widescreen PresentationEnglish, French and Spanish MonoEnglish, French and Spanish subtitlesTheatrical TrailerDeadly Friend (1986) stars Matthew Laborteaux (Little House on the Prairie) and Kristy Swanson (Buffy in the original BTVS movie) directed by Wes Craven - 2.5/5 - Laborteaux plays Paul, a new kid in a strange town whose only real friends are the girl next door, Samantha (Kristy Swanson), and a robot that he has built. When Samantha is murdered by her abusive father, Paul steals Samantha's body and implants his robot's microchips into her brain to bring her back to life. However she is merely reanimated rather than ""alive"" in the moral sense, and soon becomes out of control. I have to say it's not like any other Craven film I've seen, and it comes across more cheesy than anything else. It does have one extremely original thing going for it - death by basketball. What a hoot. The features are:Anamorphic Widescreen PresentationEnglish, French and Spanish MonoEnglish, French and Spanish subtitlesTheatrical TrailerDr. Giggles (1992) - Holly Marie Combs (Charmed)  and Glenn Quinn (Angel) - 2.5/5 - Larry Drake, the villain in ""Darkman"", plays the insane son of a mass-murdering doctor. Drake's character escapes from his confinement, sets up practice as a doctor in the town where his father was caught, and comes up with all kinds of inventive ways of killing his patients as a means of avenging his dad. The worst thing a horror film can be is boring, and it seems the film makers had this in the front of their minds because they are so busy juggling activity that the picture literally becomes cramped with action. Much could have been cut from the script and they would have had a better movie. The features are:Anamorphic Widescreen PresentationEnglish Dolby SurroundEnglish, French and Spanish subtitlesI didn't show any extra features for ""From Beyond the Grave"" because the Warner press release doesn't specifically mention any. The extra features on the whole package really just add up to the commentary by Oliver Stone on ""The Hand"" and the featurette about John Carpenter on ""Someone's Watching Me"".

337821,A3BMZYA7CT2E74,6302814685,G. Garner,"[5, 6]","I stumbled upon this movie completely by accident, and it was an extremely pleasant surprise. Anyone who has glanced at my reviews knows that I am a big fan of slasher movies. This one is more of a traditional psychological thriller, but made much better by featuring elements from the slasher, mystery, and suspense genres. It's all in how you do it. The basic premise is similar to other thrillers. But I feel it's substantially superior because they choose to shroud the proceedings in mystery. Eyes of a Stranger succeeds by building an ambience that is all its own.While it is set in the heart of a big city, the film always maintains a sense of extreme intimacy. It centers relentlessly around a few key characters, and, as the action unfolds, you are left with the sensation that they are the only people on the planet. One other key point-while the setting is urban, the movie does not suffer from that squalid look that some films had during the 70's and 80's. The bulk of the movie takes place in various apartments(the heroine's, the villain's, one of his victims').In other words, you don't wind up feeling as if you have spent two hours cruising a slum. Even when the story does venture into the uglier parts of town, things are still presented with class and a degree of taste that could easily have been missing from something dealing with this type of subject matter. This is a visually appealing film.There is a moment, near the opening of the film, where we are shown an empty phone booth on a dark, deserted street. A typical psychological thriller would omit such a scene-it contributes nothing to the plot, after all. We all knew he HAD to leave the phone booth eventually.But this movie takes the time to show you that empty phone booth. A moment like this, trivial though it might seem, goes a long way to build a sense of dread and mystery. And this makes all the difference.There are three main characters, and each is, oddly enough, quite visually arresting, although in wildly divergent ways.The primary character, played by Lauren Tewes, is a tv anchor lady. I suppose she is best known for her role on the Love Boat. Her physical dimensions are striking in the most obvious way-and my personal favorite-in that she is a gorgeous blonde. Plus, she is the best kind of gorgeous-she retains an everyday quality about her. She doesn't look as airbrushed or pencil-thin as many of today's sexpots do. And she's better in her part than you might anticipate from someone whose major accomplishment hitherto was floating around the ocean on a cruise ship.Her little sister is quite attractive, as well. However, what makes her so interesting is that her character is deaf-mute, as well as blind. She has minimal facial expression,and no spoken lines,  and yet she still manages to exude something. I can't really put it into words. It's something of an intangible thing. I suppose you'd have to see it to appreciate what I'm saying. But the girl really does hold her own, and manages to be a strong presense in the film, even considering the limitations that are built into her role.Now, the villain is also visually arresting, but in a completely different way. The man is a rapist-serial killer. And he looks the part. He is a bit of a throwback. While he dresses well, and his apartment appears clean and neat, there is a definite caveman quality to the guy. He's got a powerful, brutish look about him. As I said, he's a throwback to the days when people associated muscles with actually doing something, as opposed to serving as ornaments for pool-side frolics, a la Mario Lopez or somebody. There's absolutely nothing pretty about this guy, but you can believe him in the role. He's got a back and torso like a weightlifter. But when they show him tucking in his shirt, he's got virtually no gut. When a man's shirt bulges out in the BACK, not the front............when his back is wide, and thick............when his trapezius muscles are extremely prominent........... that's typically a sign of a brutishly strong man.The story is straightforward. A newslady suspects her neighbor is a serial killer. She investigates. And when he realizes her intentions, he decides to take it out on her handicapped sister. And it is HERE that the visual dimensions of the characters make the most profound difference. The climax of the movie finds the teenaged girl being stalked by the killer. You look at her, and see the small frame, the delicate features, the utter vulnerability. And in him you see someone so much bigger, so much stronger.......... and so unabashedly sadistic and depraved.Her helplessness does nothing to arouse any sense of pity in this man. And her age and disability do nothing to diminish his craven sexual appetites, either. You can tell, from the expression on his face, that having a beautiful young blind girl at his disposal is probably his idea of heaven. She's healthy enough for him to enjoy sexually, but unable to fight back in a consistently effective fashion. She's right next door to being helpless, but not quite......which I think adds to his enjoyment. She can move, and she can put up a token fight, but that's about as far as it goes. Check out the look on his face when she grabs that knife to try to defend herself. That's a happy man. He wouldn't mind if this went on forever.Watching the two of them together............I'm not sure I've ever experienced a more striking sight, in terms of sheer physical and moral opposites. The dynamic between the two of them is probably the most effective dimension to this film. This is one final cinematic confrontation that really stands out.It's an outstanding movie. And for traditional slasher fans, like myself, some of the stalking scenes are exceptional, as well. The opening segment, where he hunts down a waitress in her apartment, is classic. Very nicely crafted. This segment is as strong as most of what you'll find in the more traditional slasher movies. The musical score for Eyes of a Stranger is also very good. There is something very moody and understated about it.The relationship between the two sisters is handled well,also,  and serves as a nice contrast from the more sinister aspects of the story. The two have a real warmth between them. They add a gentleness, a softness, and a humanity that is often lacking in movies such as this.I really like this movie.",5,I Really Don't Know HOW this has Managed to Stay So Far Under the Radar for

337822,A2J3YURZ48PZOW,6302814685,"gman ""gman""","[2, 2]","The six films in The Twisted Terror Collection (2007) generally fall into the horror, suspense, and thriller genres.  When the set was initially released, it marked the first time some of the films were available on DVD.  Subsequently, all of these movies have been individually released on DVD.  There does not seem to be an overriding theme to these films, as the subject matter and quality varies quite a bit, with release dates ranging from 1973 through 1992.  Depending on your interests and tastes, the collection could be a good value buy for the horror aficionado.  Quick takes on the films are below.From Beyond The Grave (1973): A British production that is an anthology of four short tales, loosely based around articles obtained from a strange antique shop run by Peter Cushing.  The stories generally feature malevolent ghosts and spirits, involved in murder and other dastardly deeds.  Not all of the stories are great but the film has a very good cast, and is an interesting ride for those that have a taste for horror with an English flavor.  Rating: 3 starsSomeone's Watching Me (1978):  Written and directed by John Carpenter (The Thing), this made for TV movie features Lauren Hutton as a TV producer being stalked and terrorized by an unknown man.  The focus is on building up tension, and the victim's sense of terror and frustration.  The story is a bit slow in developing, but the action finally does pickup at the end.  Rating: 3 stars.  Carpenter's next film would be Halloween (1978).The Hand (1981):  Written and directed by Oliver Stone (JFK, World Trade Center).  Michael Caine stars as a cartoonist who has lost his hand due to a traffic accident.  The severed hand somehow develops a life of its own, and begins to kill.  It's a ridiculous premise, but it's executed quite well, with a very gripping and edgy performance by Caine, the film has enough suspense to hold your interest till the end.  Rating: 3.5 stars.Eyes Of A Stranger (1981):  Lauren Tewes, best known as cruise director Julie McCoy on TV's Love Boat, plays a TV reporter who suspects that a man who lives in her apartment building, may be a serial killer who is terrorizing Miami.  The story isn't very sophisticated, but there are some brutal kills.  Jennifer Jason Leigh makes her film debut, as a blind girl terrorized by the killer.  Rating: 4 starsDeadly Friend (1986):  Wes Craven's film may be the weakest in the lot, as Matthew Lebyorteaux stars as a teenage whiz kid, who re-animates the body of a girl (Kristy Swanson) who is accidentally killed, implanting the CPU of a robot into her brain.  It's silly, goofy, and not executed very well.  Rating: 2.5 stars.Dr Giggles (1992):  Larry Drake (Darkman), who won two Emmy for his work on LA Law, takes on the role of Dr. Giggles, the mentally unstable son of a physician, who after escaping an institution, has dedicated his life to continuing his medical pursuits.  When his attention is drawn to young girl with a heart ailment, Dr. Giggles is determined to perform surgery on her, even if it kills her.  Dr. Giggles is loaded with campy humor and bad puns that do not always work, but is still a pretty fun nasty time.  Rating: 3 stars.A mixed bag in terms of subject matter, style, and quality, The Twisted Terror Collection features six individual DVD cases, packaged in one outer box.

337824,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,6302814685,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[2, 3]","""Eyes Of A Stranger"" is a pretty decent straight-forward horror-thriller hybrid that delivers what it sets out to do.  Somewhat in the mold of a slasher (although with a different flavor), ""Eyes Of A Stranger"" is a story about a serial rapist-murderer and one woman's efforts to stop him before he gets too close to home.  The kills are not too bad for the time period that this movie originated from, the acting is actually pretty decent and the script is pretty good.  However, ""Eyes"" is definitely more of a suspense-thriller than horror movie with little in the way of scares, but it's still effective as a horror movie to some degree just by the very nature of the subject matter involved, although not to the extent that I would like.  There is an atmospheric element to this movie at times, but it is not enough to create a sense of horror in the audience as an effective pure horror movie would be able to do.  Still, that's not to take anything away from the movie's merits because the fact is that the movie is pretty good for what it is.  It's just not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, no matter how you classify the movie or what genre you assign it to.The only real criticisms that I would have would be the fish bowl scene which was highly unrealistic and the fact that the movie could have been a little more mysterious and much more suspenseful by hiding the killer's identity as this would have created a fear of the unknown in the viewer/audience.  It is this fear of the unknown that often elevates a movie to horror status and is very unsettling to the audience.  Sometimes, when you give the audience too much information about the killer and his/her motives, it dilutes the horror element involved...I think that's true in this movie to a certain extent.Still, that said, ""Eyes Of A Stranger"" is a pretty good horror-thriller with just enough to it to satisfy fans of this type of movie although it really isn't very scary at all save for maybe a scene or two here and there.  For whatever reason, ""Eyes"" struggles to build and sustain a sense of fear and/or horror in the viewer.  I think this has a lot to do with the lack of mystery regarding the killer.  However, if you like thrillers, I would definitely pick it up, but if you're looking for a horror movie like I was (the Twisted Terror Collection name is misleading for these movies), you might not be entirely satisfied.  Still, one could do a lot worse as is well-documented in my reviews.  All and all, ""Eyes"" is not a bad movie and is actually pretty decent for its type.  It's pretty close to a 3-Star movie, but then again, I'm feeling like Santa Claus today with my grading.",3,"""I'm going to kill you, Debbie."" -The Killer",1192406400,"10 15, 2007",2007,2677,"['Eyes', 'A', 'Stranger', 'pretty', 'decent', 'straight-forward', 'horror-thriller', 'hybrid', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'Somewhat', 'mold', 'slasher', 'different', 'flavor', 'Eyes', 'A', 'Stranger', 'story', 'serial', 'rapist-murderer', 'one', 'woman', 'efforts', 'stop', 'too', 'close', 'home', 'kills', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'time', 'period', 'movie', 'originated', 'acting', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'script', 'pretty', 'good', 'However', 'Eyes', 'definitely', 'more', 'suspense-thriller', 'horror', 'movie', 'little', 'way', 'scares', 'still', 'effective', 'horror', 'movie', 'degree', 'just', 'very', 'nature', 'subject', 'matter', 'involved', 'not', 'extent', 'would', 'like', 'atmospheric', 'element', 'movie', 'times', 'not', 'enough', 'create', 'sense', 'horror', 'audience', 'effective', 'pure', 'horror', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'Still', 'not', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'movie', 'merits', 'fact', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'what', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'matter', 'how', 'classify', 'movie', 'what', 'genre', 'assign', 'only', 'real', 'criticisms', 'would', 'have', 'would', 'be', 'fish', 'bowl', 'scene', 'was', 'highly', 'unrealistic', 'fact', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'mysterious', 'much', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'hiding', 'killer', 'identity', 'would', 'have', 'created', 'fear', 'unknown', 'viewer/audience', 'fear', 'unknown', 'often', 'movie', 'horror', 'status', 'very', 'unsettling', 'audience', 'Sometimes', 'when', 'give', 'audience', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'killer', 'his/her', 'motives', 'horror', 'element', 'involved', 'think', 'true', 'movie', 'certain', 'extent.Still', 'said', 'Eyes', 'A', 'Stranger', 'pretty', 'good', 'horror-thriller', 'just', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'type', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'very', 'scary', 'save', 'maybe', 'scene', 'two', 'here', 'there', 'reason', 'Eyes', 'struggles', 'build', 'sustain', 'sense', 'fear', 'and/or', 'horror', 'viewer', 'think', 'lot', 'do', 'lack', 'mystery', 'regarding', 'killer', 'However', 'like', 'thrillers', 'would', 'definitely', 'pick', 'up', ""'re"", 'looking', 'horror', 'movie', 'was', 'Twisted', 'Terror', 'Collection', 'name', 'misleading', 'movies', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'satisfied', 'Still', 'one', 'could', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'well-documented', 'reviews', 'Eyes', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'decent', 'type', 'pretty', 'close', '3-Star', 'movie', 'then', 'again', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'today', 'grading']",N/A

Made in 1981, this is what a true ""Horror"" film is to me. This is something that could actually happen to anyone. Although maybe not so much of a ""Horror"" film, more of a Thriller, is little known about and often overlooked by most people. I never thought Warner Bros would release this on dvd. A few months back, I had found this on [...] to download and buy as a windows media video file to own. To my surprise...It was the UNCUT version with missing gore intact which my vhs copy makes it look like a heavily edited TV version. As the gore is heavily cut on the original vhs release. I had read that there was an alternate version of this film on imdb.com with the gore in it back in 2004. I even emailed special FX artist Tom Savini whose behind the gore on this film, and asked him if he knew how to obtain a copy, or give me any info. He emailed me back and said he had no clue. As the previous 1st reviewer says it's Uncut which I hope it's the same one i got off of cinemanow.com which there's was from the actual film print in widescreen and an excellent digital transfer. This movie grips you and the music in the film is pretty damn creepy to me at least. This is a must have if you like such other films as Wes Craven's 1972 cult classic ""Last House On The Left"" or Meir Zarchi's ""I Spit On Your Grave"" (1978) and another long lost film probably best kept that way Jim Sotos' ""Forced Entry"" (1975) as it's not as good. Also I'd recommend snapping up ""The Burning"" (1981). Which has been banned in America for a long long time and heavily cut on the THORN EMI VHS Release in America back in 1981. While The Burning does have that cheesy music I say it's a much more better take on Friday The 13th as far as the acting goes. Although I am a huge Friday 13th fan.

I just wanted to note that every single DVD in this set is presented in what I guess you'd call anamorphic pan & scan, at a ratio of 1.78:1 or so (which fills up the entire screen on an HDTV, you see).  This is fine for four out of the six movies here; they were originally 1.85:1, so there's very little difference.  'Someone's Watching Me!,' however, was originally 1.33:1 and is cropped on the top and bottom, and 'Dr. Giggles' was originally 2.35:1 and is presented in this ratio through a combination of cropping (on the sides) and unmatting (on the bottom).  My guess is that the masters for all of these were originally made for use as programming material for HD movie channels, and were then just transferred to DVD.Anyway, it's a perfectly competent pan & scan job, but if you were hoping to see these two films in their original ratios, you won't...and the packaging does very little to let you know this beforehand.

337830,A3V2THQU2RQ1AG,6302814685,Molly C.,"[0, 0]","*** This comment may contain spoilers ***Jane, a local news anchor, has realized that her neighbor is the rapist/ serial killer that she has been reporting on nightly. Jane goes on a one woman mission to hunt him down before he can get to her and her deaf-blind sister she takes care of. When her lawyer boyfriend refuses to help, she is on her own. Jane starts playing phone games with the killer and turns the tables on him. But considering her air time as a reporter, it isn't long before he discovers her too. So it is a cat and mouse game to see who can get to who first.There are genuine moments of tension like when one victim is harassed with increasingly menacing phone calls. The cops refuse to help her, and she is in her apartment running through her living room just to turn on her light switch. When her ding dong boyfriend shows up, he pops in with a creepy mask that made me jump because I was expecting the killer. And when one woman flees her office after getting phone calls, she heads into an elevator, only to be called on the elevators emergency phone! The tension and excitement isn't too surprising considering Weiderhorn was the writer and director of RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD II (1988) and SHOCK WAVES (1977).I think the characters are well written for this type of film. You can't help but like Jane, the smart news reporter investigating the killings. When her boyfriend asks her to move in, she says No because her deaf-blind sister Tracy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is just settling into her new home. She thinks he would resent them both and eventually leave them. I can appreciate such strength and honesty from a female character. To make matters more difficult, Jane feels guilt over her Tracy's (hinted at) molestation that left her deaf-blind after leaving her alone one day. This reinforces her boyfriend's notion that Jane is on a quest to save the rest of the women in town because she couldn't save her own sister. Leigh is usually hit or miss in her movies. You either like her or not or she doesn't even register on screen. But here she is just a teenager, but plays a deaf-blind girl realistically.Adding to the creepiness of the film, is the feel of the killer just being a regular guy lost in a crowd. When Jane breaks into his home, she tries hard to find anything out of the ordinary. He eats, sleeps, and relaxes like a normal guy. It almost seems mildly perverse when Jane starts calling and harassing him. She even sucks lightly on a cigarette afterward as though she got off on it.But I do have some problems with the film. Initially, it feels like a feminist's version of REAR WINDOW where the reporter stalks and hunts the rapist/ killer herself. As a ""Reverse Rape/Revenge"" flick, this shows her character tracking him down BEFORE he can hurt her or her sister instead of shelling out revenge after the crime was committed. But the film steers dangerously into sleaze territory in some parts, which pretty much makes all feminist statements null and void. The strip club scene was unnecessary and should have been omitted.I am also concerned with the motive for the killings and its portrayal of women. Serial killers have a certain type they seek out. But this killer targets a stripper, a good girl next door, a deaf-blind young girl, and a completely random woman on the street. Sometimes he harasses the women for long periods of time and knows personal information and sometimes he just attacks because the mood strikes him. This doesn't make any sense. Either he is a meticulous killer that plans his kills or he is a deviant with a bad temper. So the only thing I could conclude is that all women are equal and worthy of death despite their differences in the filmmaker's eyes.The most tense, yet sleazy part of the film was when he breaks into Jane's home and finds Tracy there alone. (SPOILER ALERT) He begins playing games with her because she is blind such as moving around a plate and knife as she is trying to cut a piece of cake. Eventually, she notices she is not alone and attempts to flee. But what is absolutely despicable is it's showing of child molestation and attempted rape on screen which completely disgusted me. Leigh herself was barely 19 years old when this started filming.As if the age and deaf-blind factors were not bad enough, this is the second time this character gets molested in the movie. Damn, tough luck. But wait, it gets goofier. After her attack and supposed killing of the prick, she waltzes into the bathroom to start ""exploring her body"". Huh? Um, I will take a wild guess here and say that the last thing a woman wants to do after getting raped would be to start touching herself sensually. There are more important things to do like, you know, call the friggin' police!! The other part that makes this so damn disturbing is the revelation that no matter how hard Jane tried to protect her sister, she couldn't. In fact, her sister is molested BECAUSE she tried to help. So what is the theory here? That women should just give up and let themselves be mauled by men because otherwise they will get it twice as bad?Released in 1981 by Warner Bros., it clocks in at 85 minutes. It is currently unavailable on DVD.Bottom Line: Very tense & sleazy feminist alternative to REAR WINDOW.Rating: 8/10",4,Very tense & sleazy feminist alternative to REAR WINDOW,1175731200,"04 5,

Where this movie differs so much from other horror of the era is that DiSanti's identity, and face, are never hidden. You know who he is, and that he did it, from the get-go, giving us more of a suspense film than a true slasher. Tewes is convinced he's the killer, but no one will believe her (duh, of course not) and there is a very tense confrontation between she and her blind and deaf sister (well played by a very young Jennifer Jason Leigh), and DiSanti.Ken Wiederhorn had worked on PBS before this film, and apparently used this film and genre, like so many others, to try to get a bigger break into Hollywood. In all, there are some strong moments of tension, the effects are good, especially for the day (FX master Tom Savini), and Tewes surprised a lot of people with her tough character (not nearly as sweet and pure as Julie on the Love Boat), but in the end the film never generated much interest and flopped, so it's good to see it on DVD, uncut, and in widescreen format too.",4,Above Average 80's Horror,1193097600,"10 23, 2007",2007,1370,"['Made', 'back', 'early', '1980', 'heels', 'slasher', 'film', 'resurgence', 'Eyes', 'Stranger', 'did', 'best', 'break', 'away', 'endless', 'Halloween', 'clones', 'still', 'keeping', 'up', 'level', 'tension.It', 'stars', 'attractive', 'Lauren', 'Tewes', 'Love', 'Boat', 'reporter', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'verify', 'identity', 'ruthless', 'killer', 'played', 'John', 'DiSanti', 'who', 'Where', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'horror', 'era', 'DiSanti', 'identity', 'face', 'are', 'never', 'hidden', 'know', 'who', 'did', 'get-go', 'giving', 'more', 'suspense', 'film', 'true', 'slasher', 'Tewes', 'convinced', 'killer', 'one', 'will', 'believe', 'duh', 'course', 'not', 'very', 'tense', 'confrontation', 'blind', 'deaf', 'sister', 'well', 'played', 'very', 'young', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'DiSanti.Ken', 'Wiederhorn', 'had', 'worked', 'PBS', 'film', 'apparently', 'used', 'film', 'genre', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'try', 'get', 'bigger', 'break', 'Hollywood', 'are', 'strong', 'moments', 'tension', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'especially', 'day', 'FX', 'master', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'Tewes', 'surprised', 'lot', 'people', 'tough', 'character', 'not', 'nearly', 'sweet', 'pure', 'Julie', 'Love', 'Boat', 'end', 'film', 'never', 'generated', 'much', 'interest', 'flopped', 'good', 'see', 'DVD', 'uncut', 'widescreen', 'format', 'too']",N/A

Okay, now that I got my Queensryche reference out of the way, we'll focus more on this little all but unknown thriller from the early 80s.  This film tends to be labelled as a slasher film, but is more of a Hitchcockian thriller.  The gore and violence is upped a bit, probably for the slasher crowd at that time, but the movie certainly doesn't fit alongside Madman or Pieces.In the movie, Jane, a newsreporter, suspects that one of the men in her apartment complex just may be the serial killer/rapist who's been terrorizing the city.  Well, he is, and Stanley is his name.  And in the tradition of these kinds of films, ol' Stan catches on to the fact that he's been caught on to.  Turns out Jane has a deaf and mute sister, Tracy.  Easy pickins for Stan, but he soon finds out that she's not quite as easy a victim as you'd expect.I liked this movie.  I like how the killer was handled.  Here he's shown as an overweight, middleaged doofus that looks like an insurance salesman.  He reminds me of how Norman Bates was described as looking like in the original Psycho novel.  But I like the look coz it's more than likely more realistic.  He doesn't say much at all, but his calls to his victims are creepy and remind me a little bit of the killer's calls from Black Christmas.Gore is minimal, but effective, and the suspense actually works most of the time.  The film was directed by Ken Wiederhorn, who gave us the underwater nazi zombie classic, Shock Waves(which some characters are watching on T.V.).All in all, it's pretty enjoyable, and I'd recommend it to those who dig this sort of thing.....and Queensryche of course.",4,Rear Window Meets Tommy,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,1694,"['People', 'always', 'turn', 'away', 'eyes', 'strangerrrrrrrrrrr', 'Okay', 'now', 'got', 'Queensryche', 'reference', 'way', ""'ll"", 'focus', 'more', 'little', 'unknown', 'thriller', 'early', '80s', 'film', 'be', 'labelled', 'slasher', 'film', 'more', 'Hitchcockian', 'thriller', 'gore', 'violence', 'upped', 'bit', 'probably', 'slasher', 'crowd', 'time', 'movie', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'fit', 'alongside', 'Madman', 'Pieces.In', 'movie', 'Jane', 'newsreporter', 'one', 'men', 'apartment', 'complex', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'serial', 'killer/rapist', 'who', 'been', 'terrorizing', 'city', 'Well', 'Stanley', 'name', 'tradition', 'kinds', 'films', 'ol', 'Stan', 'catches', 'fact', 'been', 'caught', 'out', 'Jane', 'deaf', 'mute', 'sister', 'Tracy', 'Easy', 'Stan', 'soon', 'out', 'not', 'quite', 'easy', 'victim', ""'d"", 'expect.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'how', 'killer', 'was', 'handled', 'Here', 'shown', 'overweight', 'middleaged', 'doofus', 'insurance', 'salesman', 'how', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'was', 'described', 'looking', 'original', 'Psycho', 'novel', 'like', 'look', 'more', 'likely', 'more', 'realistic', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'calls', 'victims', 'are', 'creepy', 'remind', 'little', 'bit', 'killer', 'calls', 'Black', 'Christmas.Gore', 'minimal', 'effective', 'suspense', 'actually', 'most', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Ken', 'Wiederhorn', 'who', 'gave', 'underwater', 'nazi', 'zombie', 'classic', 'Shock', 'Waves', 'characters', 'are', 'watching', 'T.V', '.All', 'pretty', 'enjoyable', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'who', 'dig', 'sort', 'thing', '..and', 'Queensryche', 'course']",N/A
337837,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,6302814685,The Piper at the Gates,"[0, 0]","With the title ""Eyes of a Stranger"" and reading the synopsis of the story, I immediately thought that this had the makings of another ""When a Stranger Calls"" rip-off, and I really had my doubts about it. But after viewing, I was surprised that this was better than I had expected. Not to say that this is a great movie, but it does have its moments. First of all, I don't think you can classify this film an actual horror movie. It's more like a thriller with horror elements in it. Some of the kill  scenes have a ""slasher"" feel to them and there is some, but not a lot of blood and violence in the film. The basic story of the movie is, for the most part, well written. Its a story about a newscaster who is attempting to find and catch a rapist/killer in Miami where she lives. She beings to find clues and determine the killer's identity, only to find out that the killer has found out about her as well! With a story like this, its easy to see that this film is indeed much more of a thriller than horror. And though the overall story is pretty good, there are a certain few plot points that I can't help to cringe at when I see them since they just don't add up when you think about it. I felt the acting was pretty much on par, and the then very young Jennifer Jason Leigh did a decent job in her role as a deaf and blind girl. As for the movie itself, I just felt it could have been much better. While watching the first 30 minutes or so, I really thought I had found a gem of a movie here. But as the film continued, the tension or suspense didn't build the way it should have. Reasons for this was that towards the end of the film, you already knew the killer's identity and pretty much knew what was going to happen to the characters.

337838,A3NPBG9YE84S63,6302814685,Tom P. the Underground Navigator,"[8, 9]","1978's ""Halloween"" ignited a firestorm in the low budget film making industry and by 1980, a mere two years later, you saw slasher movies increasingly upping the ante and getting more and more graphic and explicit, some examples being ""Maniac,"" ""Don't Go in the House,"" and the Italian ""Macabre.""One other notable example from this year was Ken Wiederhorn's suspense/terror film ""Eyes of a Stranger,"" which was released by Georgetown Productions, the company that marketed the same year's original ""Friday the 13th.""Though in his film guide Leonard Maltin dismisses ""Eyes of a Stranger"" as ""utter trash,"" I find it to be one of the very best psycho chiller/thriller movies of the early '80s.The plot concerns a sicko psycho who is terrorizing Miami in a series of rape/murders, and a TV newswoman (Lauren Tewes) who gets hunches as to his identity.  When no one will believe her or support her case, she embarks on her own private quest to see justice served that eventually leads her into the creepy haunts of the killer's apartment.  Finally, her younger sister (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who is blind, deaf and mute as a result of a childhood kidnapping, is established as a potential victim.The opening scenes of this movie, in which the killer stalks and follows home a lovely bartender named Debbie (played by the gorgeous Gwen Lewis), sets the stage for the bite-your-nails level of suspense of the whole movie.  The sicko first harasses her with a series of obscene, sick twisted heavy breathing phone calls that he makes from a nearby payphone (this was 30 years ago after all) and eventually enters her apartment.As said in the header, ""Eyes of a Stranger"" takes its cues just as much from the Alfred Hitchcock traditions of suspense as it does from the more contemporary use of splatter effects (handled by the one and only Tom Savini) and gratuitous nudity.  In addition to the aforementioned Gwen Lewis, a number of the women here are remarkably hot.  I thought Jennifer Jason Leigh was adorable in 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and here at 18 in her film debut, she is really fine and even bares a bit of skin at the end.Thus, despite the presence of Lauren Tewes, ""the Love Boat"" this movie ain't.  It is definitely one for adults only and I wouldn't recommend anyone under 18 viewing it.With its combination though of extremely suspenseful and well directed stalk and kill scenes and first rate acting by the two female leads, I consider ""Eyes of a Stranger"" to be a classic that will hopefully find the audience it deserves on DVD.  Highly recommended to any fans of quality terror films.",5,Edge of your seat suspense film with all the qualities of a low budget slasher,1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,2610,"['1978', 'Halloween', 'ignited', 'firestorm', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'making', 'industry', '1980', 'mere', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'saw', 'slasher', 'movies', 'increasingly', 'upping', 'ante', 'getting', 'more', 'more', 'graphic', 'explicit', 'examples', 'being', 'Maniac', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Go', 'House', 'Italian', 'Macabre', 'One', 'other', 'notable', 'example', 'year', 'was', 'Ken', 'Wiederhorn', 'suspense/terror', 'film', 'Eyes', 'Stranger', 'was', 'released', 'Georgetown', 'Productions', 'company', 'marketed', 'same', 'year', 'original', 'Friday', '13th', 'film', 'guide', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'Eyes', 'Stranger', 'utter', 'trash', 'find', 'be', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'psycho', 'chiller/thriller', 'movies', 'early', 'plot', 'concerns', 'sicko', 'psycho', 'who', 'terrorizing', 'Miami', 'series', 'rape/murders', 'TV', 'newswoman', 'Lauren', 'Tewes', 'who', 'hunches', 'identity', 'When', 'one', 'will', 'believe', 'support', 'case', 'own', 'private', 'quest', 'see', 'justice', 'served', 'eventually', 'creepy', 'haunts', 'killer', 'apartment', 'Finally', 'younger', 'sister', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'who', 'blind', 'deaf', 'mute', 'result', 'childhood', 'kidnapping', 'established', 'potential', 'victim.The', 'opening', 'scenes', 'movie', 'killer', 'stalks', 'home', 'lovely', 'bartender', 'named', 'Debbie', 'played', 'gorgeous', 'Gwen', 'Lewis', 'stage', 'bite-your-nails', 'level', 'suspense', 'whole', 'movie', 'sicko', 'first', 'series', 'obscene', 'sick', 'twisted', 'heavy', 'breathing', 'phone', 'nearby', 'payphone', 'was', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'eventually', 'apartment.As', 'said', 'header', 'Eyes', 'Stranger', 'cues', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'traditions', 'suspense', 'more', 'contemporary', 'use', 'splatter', 'effects', 'handled', 'one', 'only', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'addition', 'aforementioned', 'Gwen', 'Lewis', 'number', 'women', 'here', 'are', 'remarkably', 'hot', 'thought', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'was', 'adorable', '1982', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'here', '18', 'film', 'debut', 'really', 'fine', 'even', 'bit', 'skin', 'end.Thus', 'presence', 'Lauren', 'Tewes', 'Love', 'Boat', 'movie', 'ai', ""n't"", 'definitely', 'one', 'adults', 'only', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', '18', 'viewing', 'it.With', 'combination', 'extremely', 'suspenseful', 'well', 'directed', 'stalk', 'kill', 'scenes', 'first', 'rate', 'acting', 'two', 'female', 'leads', 'consider', 'Eyes', 'Stranger', 'be', 'classic', 'will', 'hopefully', 'find', 'audience', 'DVD', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'quality', 'terror', 'films']",N/A
337839,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6302814685,trebe,"[1, 1]","Eyes Of A Stranger (1981) might be a fairly standard thriller about a TV reporter pursuing a serial killer, but it does deliver a number of brutal and bloody kills.  Lauren Tewes successfully demonstrates her acting talents in a more serious dramatic role than Julie McCoy, the cruise director on TV's Love Boat.  The film also features the motion picture debut of Jennifer Jason Leigh.A violent serial killer is at large in Miami, preying on young women.  Before he strikes, he often taunts his victims over the phone.  As she reports on the murders, Channel 3 reporter Jane Harris (Tewes) finds herself becoming more emotionally upset, and she begins to suspect that a man that lives in her apartment building may be responsible for the killings.Jane lives on the 12th floor with her sister Tracy (Jason Leigh), who was traumatized as a child, leaving her blind and unable to speak.  Doing some investigating, Jane discovers that the man she suspects is named Stanley Herbert (John DiSanti), and that his apartment is also on the 12th floor, and is visible from hers.  She sneaks into his apartment and takes a shoe as evidence, and boldly phones Herbert saying that she knows he is the killer.Herbert's compulsion to kill is overpowering.  He frequents strip clubs in search of victims, follows them home, and then attacks them, often sexually molesting them.  Watching the TV news, Herbert realizes who his mysterious caller is, setting up his inevitable visit to Jane's apartment, where he torments and violates Tracy, before Jane arrives to send him into the shower.There's not a lot of mystery in Eyes Of A Stranger, as Stanley Herbert is revealed rather early as the killer.  John DiSanti is quite good in the role, although no effort is made to provide any background about the maniac.  Besides Jane's visit to Herbert's apartment, there isn't much investigative work either.  In this quick, hard hitting, 84 minute exploitative thriller, much of the focus is on the stalking and killing of the victims.  Herbert favors using a blade, resulting in some nasty kills, including a decapitation, and several throat slashings.Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance is perhaps the most daring, as she is assaulted, and later exposes her breast in a twistedly thoughtful scene.  She looks about 15, although she was already an adult at 19.  Although she would always be associated with Julie McCoy, Lauren Tewes briefly sheds her squeaky clean image.  Eyes Of A Stranger is a no frills, down and dirty, misogynistic crime thriller that while following very predictable lines, provides some solid gut level thrills.
