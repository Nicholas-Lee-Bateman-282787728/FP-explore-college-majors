But their true strength and staying power comes to life in the live performances. I bought the DVD when I was under pressure and had my back against the wall. It reminded me that there is more to life that what was happening in front of my eyes. There is a bigger world out there, beyond our perceived differences. The music has a unifying effect, reminding us of our common humanity and of what counts in this world. When you get caught up in something petty, watch this DVD. It would pull me out, and remind me of what matters. Power of song and voice, live - lifts you from the mundane, so you can do your job better when you have to go back in.",5,Unite,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,725,"['albums', 'are', 'always', 'meticulously', 'crafted', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'detail', 'true', 'strength', 'staying', 'power', 'life', 'live', 'performances', 'bought', 'DVD', 'when', 'was', 'pressure', 'had', 'back', 'wall', 'reminded', 'more', 'life', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'front', 'eyes', 'bigger', 'world', 'there', 'perceived', 'differences', 'music', 'unifying', 'effect', 'reminding', 'common', 'humanity', 'what', 'world', 'When', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'something', 'petty', 'watch', 'DVD', 'would', 'pull', 'out', 'remind', 'what', 'matters', 'Power', 'song', 'voice', 'live', 'lifts', 'mundane', 'can', 'do', 'job', 'better', 'when', 'have', 'go', 'back']",N/A

He is one of the few artists that I never got to see in concert. Well, this little jewel of a DVD more than makes up for this. I always knew what a great composer he was, and figured that his records were mostly studio overdubs. Well, this video shows what an incredible guitarist and musician he really is, even in a live setting. The backup band are all stellar musicians as well, some playing several different instruments. There are two drummers, and at one point, there are three. The very polite audience knew what a rare treat this concert was, as you can tell by their enthusiastic response between compositions. This was filmed at what is probably considered his artistic peak, with the release of QE2. I can ignore the few minor quibbles, since this was filmed 25 years ago. Mike Oldfield on DVD is better than none at all.

Though Mike's guitar work is fabulous, it's his keyboardist that intrigued me the most.  But of course, I love watching keyboardists and various piano players play aggressively.  My favorite performance in this 1981 show is ""Ommadawn.""  And of course, it never gets tiring for me to watch and here ""Tubular Bells"" performed live.I have several of Mike Oldfield's DVD's.  My favorite is still his video collection called ""Elements"", but his European-only release of ""Tubular Bells II and III"" are his best two shows.  It's unfortunate that this DVD is only a Region 2 DVD, unplayable on American DVD players.  Hopefully, they will have the sense to release ""Tubular Bells II and III"" of High Definition Blu-Ray to be sold in America.  And Mike Oldfield's ""Millenium Bell"" concert is pretty good too.",3,I'd enjoy this show more if the video quality was better,1289174400,"11 8, 2010",2010,1083,"['getting', 'use', 'finder', 'detail', 'High', 'Definition', 'TV', 'Blu-Ray', 'getting', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'DVD', 'may', 'have', 'tolerated', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'definitely', 'sounded', 'dated', 'ancient.This', 'concert', 'performance', 'better', 'get', 'further', 'Mike', 'guitar', 'work', 'fabulous', 'keyboardist', 'intrigued', 'most', 'course', 'love', 'watching', 'keyboardists', 'various', 'piano', 'players', 'play', 'aggressively', 'favorite', 'performance', '1981', 'show', 'Ommadawn', 'course', 'never', 'tiring', 'watch', 'here', 'Tubular', 'Bells', 'performed', 'live.I', 'have', 'several', 'Mike', 'Oldfield', 'DVD', 'favorite', 'still', 'video', 'collection', 'called', 'Elements', 'European-only', 'release', 'Tubular', 'Bells', 'II', 'III', 'are', 'best', 'two', 'shows', 'unfortunate', 'DVD', 'only', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'unplayable', 'American', 'DVD', 'players', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'have', 'sense', 'release', 'Tubular', 'Bells', 'II', 'III', 'High', 'Definition', 'Blu-Ray', 'be', 'sold', 'America', 'Mike', 'Oldfield', 'Millenium', 'Bell', 'concert', 'pretty', 'good', 'too']",N/A
986258,A1J1163Q56YIVZ,B000F9T764,Shaun Anderson,"[7, 7]","Mike Oldfield's live performance at Montreux in 1981 is a welcome addition to an ever growing DVD library for this most talented and unique musician. Much of the music is culled from the albums ""Platinum"" and ""QE2"" which at the time were his two most recent releases. This may come as a disappointment to some, for these two albums regularly divide Oldfield fans. Nevertheless rocked up renditions of ""Ommadawn"" and ""Tubular Bells"" should keep most happy. The music is great naturally, and its very welcome to see an enthusiastic audience for Oldfield's music, but as a time capsule for 1981 it is unintentionally hilarious. Oldfield survives with his reputation firmly intact, but Maggie Reilly looks like something out of a low budget horror film, and her vocal additions are sometimes irritating. At this point Oldfield had not quite gravitated to composing songs, so Reilly is little more than a backing vocalist., and delights of ""Moonlight Shadow"" were two years away. The remainder of Oldfield's talented band perform with much enthusiasm, with a cameo appearance by Stephen King minus the glasses on keyboards. The most important thing for fans though is what kind of sound and picture restoration has Eagle produced, on the sound front it is fair and those with 5.1 surround will get more out of the this DVD. The picture is not all it could be with, with colours sometimes seeping into each other and a certain amount of grain. It doesn't look as though Eagle have re-mastered the picture  at all. Nevertheless these are trifling complaints, it is just very good to have such archive material available to enjoy.",4,Archive Oldfield.,1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,1622,"['Mike', 'Oldfield', 'live', 'performance', 'Montreux', '1981', 'welcome', 'addition', 'ever', 'growing', 'DVD', 'library', 'most', 'talented', 'unique', 'musician', 'Much', 'music', 'culled', 'albums', 'Platinum', 'QE2', 'time', 'were', 'two', 'most', 'recent', 'releases', 'may', 'come', 'disappointment', 'two', 'albums', 'regularly', 'divide', 'Oldfield', 'fans', 'Nevertheless', 'rocked', 'up', 'renditions', 'Ommadawn', 'Tubular', 'Bells', 'should', 'keep', 'most', 'happy', 'music', 'great', 'naturally', 'very', 'welcome', 'see', 'enthusiastic', 'audience', 'Oldfield', 'music', 'time', 'capsule', '1981', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', 'Oldfield', 'reputation', 'firmly', 'intact', 'Maggie', 'Reilly', 'something', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'film', 'vocal', 'additions', 'are', 'sometimes', 'irritating', 'point', 'Oldfield', 'had', 'not', 'quite', 'gravitated', 'composing', 'songs', 'so', 'Reilly', 'little', 'more', 'backing', 'vocalist.', 'delights', 'Moonlight', 'Shadow', 'were', 'two', 'years', 'away', 'remainder', 'Oldfield', 'talented', 'band', 'perform', 'much', 'enthusiasm', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Stephen', 'King', 'minus', 'glasses', 'keyboards', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'fans', 'what', 'kind', 'sound', 'picture', 'restoration', 'Eagle', 'produced', 'sound', 'front', 'fair', '5.1', 'surround', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'DVD', 'picture', 'not', 'could', 'be', 'colours', 'sometimes', 'seeping', 'other', 'certain', 'amount', 'grain', ""n't"", 'look', 'Eagle', 'have', 're-mastered', 'picture', 'Nevertheless', 'are', 'trifling', 'complaints', 'just', 'very', 'good', 'have', 'such', 'archive', 'material', 'available', 'enjoy']",N/A
