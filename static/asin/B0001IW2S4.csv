I really enjoy this set. You can also listen to Barry's comments over the show as an extra feature.

807695,AM6SOTOKGRZGA,B0001IW2S4,Jerry McDaniel,"[18, 18]","i saw this TV special on CBS when it came out. a star-studded crowd is on hand, most notably Dennis Franz from 'NYPD Blue'. they sing and dance the night away in this wonderful concert. the setting is a bit more intimate and therefore the atmosphere feels a little ""cramped"" for the typical high energy Manilow show...nonetheless, it still allows for Barry to sing his lungs off. there's 2 DVDs here. one of them shows the CBS show as it aired and the second DVD shows the rehearsal and the behind the scenes people instructing the audience how to behave since the show was being taped for TV. the Disc that says: ""Extended Uncut Version as Taped"" is actually the disc that contains the CBS show that aired. And so, the first disc that says ""Broadcast Version as Aired"" is the one that's for tape and not broadcast! at least that's how they were in the DVD i got! now that i've confused you i'll add that the songs are all great. ""They Dance!"" and ""Turn The Radio Up"" have become new 'classics'. ""Can't Smile Without You"" is done straight through, he doesn't invite anyone up on stage this time around like on the current 2 Nights Live CD. the features on this DVD contain a very detailed Album Discography. They list imports from Japan, Russia, England in addition to his American released CDs. they also list a bulk of his awards down through the years. they also list his two BMI Million Airs Awards. ""Copacabana"", for example, reached a million airplays by 1979...a year after it hit the charts in 1978!! there is also a biography on screen too and a photo gallery of stills from the concert! there is also a complete list of all of his tour names: like ""Big Fun Tour de Force""; ""Paradise Caf&eacute; Tour""; ""Manilow Live Tour""; ""Live on Broadway"" tour...etc. all in all, this is a great Manilow show from 2002.",5,the TV special on CBS,1083974400,"05 8, 2004",2004,1815,"['i', 'saw', 'TV', 'special', 'CBS', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'star-studded', 'crowd', 'hand', 'most', 'notably', 'Dennis', 'Franz', ""'NYPD"", 'Blue', 'sing', 'dance', 'night', 'away', 'wonderful', 'concert', 'setting', 'bit', 'more', 'intimate', 'therefore', 'atmosphere', 'little', 'cramped', 'typical', 'high', 'energy', 'Manilow', 'show', 'nonetheless', 'still', 'Barry', 'sing', 'lungs', 'off', '2', 'DVDs', 'here', 'one', 'CBS', 'show', 'aired', 'second', 'DVD', 'rehearsal', 'scenes', 'people', 'instructing', 'audience', 'how', 'behave', 'show', 'was', 'being', 'taped', 'TV', 'Disc', 'Extended', 'Uncut', 'Version', 'Taped', 'actually', 'disc', 'CBS', 'show', 'aired', 'so', 'first', 'disc', 'Broadcast', 'Version', 'Aired', 'one', 'tape', 'not', 'broadcast', 'least', 'how', 'were', 'DVD', 'i', 'got', 'now', 'i', ""'ve"", 'confused', 'i', ""'ll"", 'add', 'songs', 'are', 'great', 'Dance', 'Turn', 'Radio', 'Up', 'have', 'become', 'new', ""'classics"", 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Smile', 'done', 'straight', ""n't"", 'invite', 'anyone', 'up', 'stage', 'time', 'current', '2', 'Nights', 'Live', 'CD', 'features', 'DVD', 'contain', 'very', 'detailed', 'Album', 'Discography', 'list', 'imports', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'England', 'addition', 'American', 'released', 'CDs', 'also', 'list', 'bulk', 'awards', 'down', 'years', 'also', 'list', 'two', 'BMI', 'Million', 'Airs', 'Awards', 'Copacabana', 'example', 'reached', 'million', 'airplays', '1979', 'year', 'hit', 'charts', '1978', 'also', 'biography', 'screen', 'too', 'photo', 'gallery', 'stills', 'concert', 'also', 'complete', 'list', 'tour', 'names', 'Big', 'Fun', 'Tour', 'de', 'Force', 'Paradise', 'Caf', 'eacute', 'Tour', 'Manilow', 'Live', 'Tour', 'Live', 'Broadway', 'tour', 'etc', 'great', 'Manilow', 'show', '2002']",N/A
807696,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B0001IW2S4,Kathy W,"[0, 0]","This is a CBS Special 2 DVD package, filmed at the Kodak Theater in Hollywood (this place is HUGE!). I believe it was done in 2002.  I actually bought this DVD in Manhattan right before I went to a Manilow concert.DVD # 1 is the Special, as aired on CBS.  It starts with a medley of songs, ""Ready to Take a Chance Again, Daybreak, Somewhere in the Night, and This One's for You"". Barry is in great form on this special and is very animated and expressive.  Lots of close-up shots.  He does the greats, such as ""Even Now, Weekend in New England, Copa, Mandy, I Write the Songs, Looks Like We Made It"", and ""Can't Smile Without You"".  Also included is ""Turn the Radio Up,"" which is not on many of his CDs and DVDs and the uptempo ""They Dance,"" which you hear now and then.  Great sound and visual quality on the DVDs.  Barry did this show so perfectly.  I don't think it could have been done any better. It's obvious he LOVES what he's doing.  Looks like DVD#1 is 46  minutes.  Great job and the audience LOVED him! He definitely gave 120% or better! He never lip-synchs, either.  Unlike many entertainers, all his songs are done fresh.There are also tons of features on the DVD: Barry's Biography, Discography (prior albums and listing of songs on them), Facts, Photo Gallery (26), Air Rundown (songs put on the air), Credits, Song Lyrics, and Web Links.DVD #2 is the extended uncut version, as taped, and is about 1  hours long. It begins with general pre-taping instructions to the audience and continues with the show. There's plenty of extra chit chat between Barry and the audience in between some songs and groups of songs.  Barry is witty and charming, warm and unassuming.  He seems anxious to keep the audience laughing and entertained between ""takes"".  I sense that Barry is one of the few entertainers who is sincerely concerned about making sure the audience feels truly appreciated.  He has so much class!  It's neat watching all the added stuff in between takes as they start and stop.  As always, he introduces the supporting musicians and acknowledges their good work. Again, classy guy that he is, he also thanks the audience many times.  They LOVE him and give him a zillion standing ovations.  ""Somewhere Down the Road"" is also on DVD#2.  As he kibitzes with the audience in between takes, he also sings a wee bit of ""Who Needs to Dream."" Extras on the 2nd DVD include the option to listen with Barry's audio commentary about what was going on during filming, what he was thinking, ""why"" this and that, etc.Fantastic job, Barry!

A few songs, I've never heard before, and have no interest in hearing again,  ""Could it Be Magic"", not even included, and it was one of his best.  More like a rehersal.  Producer telling the audience when and how to clap.  (ugh)  Some songs he sung over, because he wasn't satisfied with the way he sung them. Bits and pieces of songs repeated.  Barry didn't sound his best.  He should lower the key on some of them.  When one ages, or doesn't practice enough, voice tends to deepen.  Too much talking to the audience and not enough singing.

807699,A1ZDBXLPZ11CBS,B0001IW2S4,Ralph Brown,"[23, 26]","I've been a Manilow fan since the mid-70s, and it's nice to see him get ""re-appreciated"" (though his support has always been there and I haven't gone to a show that wasn't sold out).  His performance is terrific, as usual.  The show is ""greatest hits"" set, but with so many hits over the years, there's so much uncovered and this release will only leave a fan wanting more.This is an interesting release, presenting both the TV version and un-cut ""portions"" of the show (presented in its original full screen aspect ratio and with an option for 5.1 sound that mostly just brings in surrounding crowd noise).  It's fascinating to see all the in-between instructions and chatter (turn up your volume high to hear Barry given an inspirational ""break a leg"" [not in those exact words] and Barry's response right before the show begins).I only find it odd that the supplied Concert List on the DVD indicates that even more songs were performed that night.  Was it already decided not to tape those songs?  If they were taped, then this un-cut version isn't really complete.  It's also nice hearing Barry talk on the commentary, but for a 2-disc set, I expected more, though the price is very good.I recommend this, and what Manilow fan will hesitate to buy, but I just hope someone really puts together a retrospective DVD set of the performer (TV special bits, promotional videos, concert clips, documentary footage).  He deserves it, and since this is the third or fourth Manilow DVD release, there's obviously a buying audience out there.One last note: In the copy I bought, the content of the discs were incorrected switched (extended version on disc labeled TV version and vice versa).",4,"Buy It, Of Course, But...",1082678400,"04 23, 2004",2004,1685,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'Manilow', 'fan', 'mid-70s', 'nice', 'see', 'get', 're-appreciated', 'support', 'always', 'been', 'have', ""n't"", 'gone', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'sold', 'out', 'performance', 'terrific', 'usual', 'show', 'greatest', 'hits', 'set', 'so', 'many', 'hits', 'years', 'so', 'much', 'uncovered', 'release', 'will', 'only', 'leave', 'fan', 'wanting', 'more.This', 'interesting', 'release', 'presenting', 'TV', 'version', 'un-cut', 'portions', 'show', 'presented', 'original', 'full', 'screen', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'option', '5.1', 'sound', 'mostly', 'just', 'brings', 'surrounding', 'crowd', 'noise', 'fascinating', 'see', 'in-between', 'instructions', 'chatter', 'turn', 'up', 'volume', 'high', 'hear', 'Barry', 'given', 'inspirational', 'break', 'leg', 'not', 'exact', 'words', ']', 'Barry', 'response', 'right', 'show', 'only', 'find', 'odd', 'supplied', 'Concert', 'List', 'DVD', 'even', 'more', 'songs', 'were', 'performed', 'night', 'Was', 'already', 'decided', 'not', 'tape', 'songs', 'were', 'taped', 'then', 'un-cut', 'version', ""n't"", 'really', 'complete', 'also', 'nice', 'hearing', 'Barry', 'talk', 'commentary', '2-disc', 'set', 'expected', 'more', 'price', 'very', 'good.I', 'recommend', 'what', 'Manilow', 'fan', 'will', 'hesitate', 'buy', 'just', 'hope', 'someone', 'really', 'together', 'retrospective', 'DVD', 'set', 'performer', 'TV', 'special', 'bits', 'promotional', 'videos', 'concert', 'clips', 'documentary', 'footage', 'third', 'fourth', 'Manilow', 'DVD', 'release', 'obviously', 'buying', 'audience', 'there.One', 'last', 'note', 'copy', 'bought', 'content', 'discs', 'were', 'incorrected', 'switched', 'extended', 'version', 'disc', 'labeled', 'TV', 'version', 'vice', 'versa']",N/A
