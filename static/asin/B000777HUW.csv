877343,A249PQY000ECIE,B000777HUW,"B. A. Dilger ""floating world""","[1, 1]","Anna May Wong was born in the wrong times. In fifty years she would have been seen in a movie or two, maybe even TV. But her age was one of the ""Yellow peril"", with lurid novels depicting acts of barbarism and depravity by asiatic peoples. And who's to say they weren't right? Anna was relegated to roles of treachery and deceit, and she played them well. In ""Piccadilly"" she steals the show from the major stars,  cast as a poor scullery maid that is given the opportunity to advance in life. As an exotic Chinese dancer,  she grabs her role  with gusto. The obstacle to her success is the club owner's girlfriend, a manipulative fading star dancer the movie trys to make the heroine. Yeech! Shosho (Anna) is blatantly stereotyped and relegated to a villianess who seduces the owner of the club. Nobody is too moral in this movie and Anna emerges as the most sympathetic charactor. At least she has the motive of moving up in life. Her expected murder only illustrates the degenerate culture of the late 1920's, and the prejudices of another age. This silent film is almost modern, and has a good soundtrack that doesn't interrupt the show.",5,Wong Times,1219708800,"08 26, 2008",2008,1141,"['Anna', 'May', 'Wong', 'was', 'born', 'wrong', 'times', 'fifty', 'years', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'movie', 'two', 'maybe', 'even', 'TV', 'age', 'was', 'one', 'Yellow', 'peril', 'lurid', 'novels', 'depicting', 'acts', 'barbarism', 'depravity', 'asiatic', 'peoples', 'who', 'say', 'were', ""n't"", 'right', 'Anna', 'was', 'relegated', 'roles', 'treachery', 'deceit', 'played', 'well', 'Piccadilly', 'show', 'major', 'stars', 'cast', 'poor', 'scullery', 'maid', 'given', 'opportunity', 'advance', 'life', 'exotic', 'Chinese', 'dancer', 'grabs', 'role', 'gusto', 'obstacle', 'success', 'club', 'owner', 'girlfriend', 'manipulative', 'fading', 'star', 'movie', 'trys', 'make', 'heroine', 'Yeech', 'Shosho', 'Anna', 'blatantly', 'stereotyped', 'relegated', 'villianess', 'who', 'owner', 'club', 'Nobody', 'too', 'moral', 'movie', 'Anna', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'charactor', 'least', 'motive', 'moving', 'up', 'life', 'expected', 'murder', 'only', 'degenerate', 'culture', 'late', '1920', 'prejudices', 'age', 'silent', 'film', 'almost', 'modern', 'good', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'interrupt', 'show']",N/A

There are two major musical numbers in the film, and it would have really accentuated them to have the music of the times in the film rather than the modern score that just doesn't seem to fit. Unfortunately, British films didn't convert to sound until 1930, so this film remains as a ""silent musical"".It's a very good film that is basically about how life goes on, and today's celebrities and scandals are quickly forgotten tomorrow. It also shows the flimsy basis in many cases for being considered talented. The female headliner of the night club is basically there because she is the owner's girlfriend and is being carried to a large degree by her dance partner. When he decides to leave England and try to make it on Broadway, the owner knows the score and seeks a novelty to fill in what he has lost. He sees Anna May Wong's character dancing in the night club scullery and fires her for it, but later he realizes that maybe an exotic act is what he needs to draw an audience. He rehires her as a dancer. He is captivated by both the girl and her act, and at this point the film takes a sharp turn and becomes a bit of a crime drama and mystery.Anna May Wong is probably the only performer most American audiences will recognize with one fleeting exception. At the beginning of the film there is a heavyset customer of the nightclub who is complaining about a dirty dish. That complaining customer is Charles Laughton in a very small and very early role.",5,It could only have been better if it had not been silent,1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,1604,"['kind', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'early', 'sound', 'movie', 'Someone', 'else', 'mentioned', 'being', 'put', 'off', 'score', 'was', 'too', 'are', 'two', 'major', 'musical', 'numbers', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'accentuated', 'have', 'music', 'times', 'film', 'rather', 'modern', 'score', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'Unfortunately', 'British', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'convert', 'sound', '1930', 'film', 'silent', 'musical', '.It', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'basically', 'how', 'life', 'today', 'celebrities', 'scandals', 'are', 'quickly', 'forgotten', 'tomorrow', 'also', 'flimsy', 'basis', 'many', 'cases', 'being', 'considered', 'talented', 'female', 'headliner', 'night', 'club', 'basically', 'there', 'owner', 'girlfriend', 'being', 'carried', 'large', 'degree', 'dance', 'partner', 'When', 'leave', 'England', 'try', 'make', 'Broadway', 'owner', 'score', 'novelty', 'fill', 'what', 'lost', 'Anna', 'May', 'Wong', 'character', 'dancing', 'night', 'club', 'scullery', 'later', 'maybe', 'exotic', 'act', 'what', 'draw', 'audience', 'dancer', 'captivated', 'girl', 'act', 'point', 'film', 'sharp', 'turn', 'bit', 'crime', 'drama', 'mystery.Anna', 'May', 'Wong', 'probably', 'only', 'performer', 'most', 'American', 'audiences', 'will', 'recognize', 'one', 'fleeting', 'exception', 'beginning', 'film', 'heavyset', 'customer', 'nightclub', 'who', 'complaining', 'dirty', 'dish', 'complaining', 'customer', 'Charles', 'Laughton', 'very', 'small', 'very', 'early', 'role']",N/A

The extras on this are worth the price of admission.As an coauthor of one of the books on Anna May Wong I awaited this like many other keepers of the flame. With three books on Anna May now out, I still was not satisfied. I couldn't figure out what it was that was lacking. When I started looking into Anna May Wong's career some thirty years ago, you couldn't find a picture of her at most libraries. Then the cult phase started. People started writing more and asking around. Occasionally an article would be written in a nostalgic magazine. Eventually her films were selling in the private markets.Three books.Now this.....Anna May Wong's film career is not lost anymore. Milestone did her proud in so many ways. There is footage of the 2004 Asian Film Festival's panel (with Nancy Kwan) on her, though the sound quality on that is  rough. There is a vintage introductory sound film made as a prologue to the movie, which is quite interesting. Then there are the photos. As I watched them run by I thought of the searches at the libraries so many years ago, wondering what I would have thought back then had I run into a gold mine such as this. I was also reminded of going through a stack of original photos from another one of her films, wishing I had the thousands required to buy them all. At forty dollars apiece(fifteen years ago)I spent a week's pay, knowing that once I left Hollywood to go back home, I would probably not see the rest of those photos again. Indeed, I have not.However... this DVD is that gold mine for those who have wished to see Anna May in all her glory.Maybe the people keeping some of her films locked up will see the beauty presented here and allow the public to enjoy her other works. Milestone did this as a labor of love. Anna May is not an extra in a Fairbanks movie anymore. Milestone gave us Anna May Wong, the star.Chei Mi Lane",5,Anna May Wong Will Finally Be Remembered,1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,1901,"['just', 'got', 'look', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'price', 'admission.As', 'coauthor', 'one', 'books', 'Anna', 'May', 'Wong', 'awaited', 'like', 'many', 'other', 'keepers', 'flame', 'three', 'books', 'Anna', 'May', 'now', 'still', 'was', 'not', 'satisfied', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'lacking', 'When', 'started', 'looking', 'Anna', 'May', 'Wong', 'career', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'picture', 'most', 'libraries', 'Then', 'cult', 'phase', 'started', 'People', 'started', 'writing', 'more', 'asking', 'around', 'Occasionally', 'article', 'would', 'be', 'written', 'nostalgic', 'magazine', 'Eventually', 'films', 'were', 'selling', 'private', 'markets.Three', 'books.Now', '..Anna', 'May', 'Wong', 'film', 'career', 'not', 'lost', 'anymore', 'Milestone', 'did', 'proud', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'footage', '2004', 'Asian', 'Film', 'Festival', 'panel', 'Nancy', 'Kwan', 'sound', 'quality', 'rough', 'vintage', 'introductory', 'sound', 'film', 'made', 'prologue', 'movie', 'quite', 'interesting', 'Then', 'are', 'photos', 'watched', 'run', 'thought', 'searches', 'libraries', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'back', 'then', 'had', 'run', 'gold', 'mine', 'such', 'was', 'also', 'reminded', 'going', 'stack', 'original', 'photos', 'one', 'films', 'wishing', 'had', 'thousands', 'required', 'buy', 'forty', 'dollars', 'apiece', 'fifteen', 'years', 'ago', 'spent', 'week', 'pay', 'knowing', 'once', 'left', 'Hollywood', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'see', 'rest', 'photos', 'again', 'Indeed', 'have', 'not.However', 'DVD', 'gold', 'mine', 'who', 'have', 'wished', 'see', 'Anna', 'May', 'glory.Maybe', 'people', 'keeping', 'films', 'locked', 'up', 'will', 'see', 'beauty', 'presented', 'here', 'allow', 'public', 'enjoy', 'other', 'works', 'Milestone', 'did', 'labor', 'love', 'Anna', 'May', 'not', 'extra', 'Fairbanks', 'movie', 'anymore', 'Milestone', 'gave', 'Anna', 'May', 'Wong', 'star.Chei', 'Mi', 'Lane']",N/A
877346,A3QIW6ULPIPM2V,B000777HUW,Chip Kaufmann,"[31, 31]","A lot of attention has been paid to this film first on screen in special showings and now on DVD thanks to the presence of Anna May Wong. Her performance is indeed a revelation but there's much more to the film than just Anna. PICCADILLY is visually a very stylish film thanks to the trademark fluid camerawork of director E.A.Dupont. The sets of the Piccadilly Club are breathtaking. Although stylishly contemporary for when the film was made, they now serve as a time capsule for us today taking us back to 1929 London.The use of lighting especially in the scenes with Anna May Wong gives added depth to the proceedings. And while this is definitely her movie there are other fine performances as well. Cyril Ritchard as Gilda Gray's partner in the opening scenes (I thought I was watching Fred Astaire), Charles Laughton (in his first film role) as a dissatisfied club customer, and especially King Ho Chang as Wong's boyfriend Jim who ultimately holds the key to the film's resolution. PICCADILLY plays very much like an exotic version of PANDORA'S BOX (made a year earlier and directed by another German, G.W. Pabst) with Wong as a Chinese Louise Brooks. The story is basically a backstage melodrama done many times before and since but it's the style and the performances that really put it over.I do have one problem with this DVD and that is the score by Neil Brand. Written for 7 piece jazz band, there is an overall sameness to it throughout the course of the film. Scenes such as Wong's Chinese dance or most of the scenes in Limehouse could have used a different and more dramatic scoring in my opinion. The composer is on the special features segment of the DVD explaining what he did and why which is helpful in understanding his choices. It isn't a bad score, it just didn't work for me.Overall the film is lovingly restored, the DVD has a number of bonus features, and we have yet another top quality release from Milestone Films. People interested in Anna May Wong (and there seem to be many) should check out her performance as a Madame Butterfly like character in TOLL OF THE SEA, the first ever Technicolor feature made back in 1922 when Anna was only 17.

877347,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000777HUW,C. O. DeRiemer,"[1, 1]","There are three reasons to watch Piccadilly, a 1929 British silent backstage melodrama. The performance of Anna May Wong is primary. She's a knockout as Shosho, a Chinese dishwasher in a posh London nightclub who gets a chance to show how she can dance, and then becomes a star. Wong is so charismatic, so fine a performer and so confident an actress, that you might wonder whatever happened to her. But there's more to Piccadilly than Wong. Perhaps not too much, but enough to enjoy the passing parade of dated movie choreography and the moody atmosphere of transplanted German expressionism. The downside is the story...one of those behind-the-scenes melodramas of entertainers and impresarios, stilted and dated, filled with tremulous glances, suspicious glares, clutched hankies and faces turned away.Valentine Wilmot (Jameson Thomas) owns the Piccadilly Club, the poshest of the posh, where the sophisticates of London cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me, dressed to the nines, come to dance and dine, and to watch Mabel & Vic, ""London's Greatest Dance Attraction."" Wilmot is a tough, smooth, perfectionist. He made the Piccadilly what it is. He discovered Mabel Greenfield (Gilda Gray) and made stars out of her and her dance partner, Vic Smiles (Cyril Ritchard). While he appreciates Mabel's talents, his nightclub comes first. Mabel really loves the guy and Vic really loves Mabel. (""My dear, I'm simply mad about you!"") One night a diner is given a dirty plate. He makes a scene; Wilmot is furious and storms into the kitchen and scullery. There he sees Shosho, dancing on a table for the other workers when she should have been washing dishes. He fires her. Then he has second thoughts. Shosho has something that the impresario in Wilmot tells him might make a star attraction...exotic, sensuous, unusual. It's not long before Shosho is a smash. By this time Vic has left, Shosho finds it no trouble at all to delightfully snare Wilmot (in probably the best scene in the movie) and Mabel is jealous. Into this hot stew of fervid emotions, a shot rings out, scandal ensues, a trial is held...justice, both criminal and moral, is served up. And in that great tradition of melodramatic showbiz...life goes on with a million more stories undoubtedly waiting to be told. The storyline is a slog.Still, the big dance number with Mabel & Vic at the start of the movie is a delight of dated style. Mabel and Vic each come prancing down the two grand staircases that bracket the Piccadilly's elegant dance floor, he in tails, she in a swirling gown, and off they go. It's one of those tricky, ricky-ticky fast numbers where elbows and feet fly about, complete with winking glances of mischievous fun. It goes on and on, with Vic and Mabel each having a chance to shine. Mabel flirts and shows her legs. Vic with slicked back hair seductively grins with the silent nasal charm of Jack Buchanan or Nol Coward. It's the kind of well-meaning, ""classy"" dance that Fred Astaire drove a stake through four years later in Flying Down to Rio. However, watch this number with affection. It does no harm and at one time held the paying movie customers in thrall.The look of the film is all moody atmosphere. This isn't enough to salvage the movie by itself, but it gives Piccadilly a lot of visual class.And then there's Anna May Wong, an actress of talent, style and screen presence. She's featured in the billing but she dominates the movie. She comes straight through the camera to us, sexy and innocent, calculating and surprised, whose dancing captures us and whose acting tells us here is a woman to pay attention to. As an actress of Chinese descent, she hadn't a chance in Hollywood except as a stereotype. In the Twenties she finally left for Europe and had a few star roles in Germany and England, but then returned to Hollywood with a contract that seemed to assure her of star Hollywood roles. The contract didn't say major star roles with star male leads. She lost the leads in The Good Earth and Dragon Seed because producers said she looked too Chinese. She had to watch as Luise Rainer and Katherine Hepburn starred, both gussied up in some of the oddest ""Chinese"" eyelids and makeup Hollywood ever devised. Anna May Wong wound up playing characters with names like Su Lin, Lin Ying, Lan Ying and, in an explosion of Hollywood creativity, Lan Ying Lin. (I'm not kidding: Impact, Bombs Over Burma, Dangerous to Know and Daughter of Shanghai.) Then there was Ling Moy, Kim Ling, A-hsing, Lois Ling and, of course, Chinese Woman. (Daughter of the Dragon, Island of Lost Men, The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Ellery Queen's Penthouse Mystery and Producers' Showcase)So put Piccadilly in the DVD player, probably with your finger on the fast-forward button, to watch Mabel & Vic in their big number and, most of all, to watch a woman who could have been a great star if it hadn't been for Hollywood.The DVD restoration looks much better than one might expect. However, you'll probably best enjoy the screen music, written for the restoration, if you also enjoy the incessant chatter of those golf announcers who can't keep their mouths shut. The music never stops. This is one DVD where it pays to watch the extras before you watch the movie. The audio is not good on ""Dangerous to Know: The Life and Legacy of Anna May Wong,"" but the feature is informative.",4,"Anna May Wong, a fine actress who wound up playing Su Lin, Lin Ying, Lan Ying,

877349,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B000777HUW,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[2, 2]","Anna May Wong (1905-1961) made several notable films in Hollywood--including the first Technicolor feature, THE TOLL OF THE SEA--but she was an Asian actress in an era when her race generally limited her to supporting roles.  Frustrated with her situation, she went to Europe, where she first appeared in German film, later made a hit on the London stage, and went on to star in five English-made films.  Perhaps the most famous of these was the 1929 silent film PICCADILLY.The story is essentially a classic back-stage love triangle.  The Piccadilly Club is a restaurant and watering hole where dancers Mable Greenfield (Gilda Gray) and Victor Smiles (Cyril Ritchard) are star attractions in a series of dance routines.  Victor is in love with Mable, but she rejects him in favor of the club owner Valentine Wiltmont (Jameson Thomas.)  When Victor presses Mable, Valentine fires him.  But it soon transpires that it was Victor, not Mable, that the crowds came to see, and Valetine is hard pressed for a new star until he accidently discovers Shosho (Anna May Wong), a Chinese scullery maid who is given to entertaining kitchen staff with a bit of table-top dancing.  Although he fires Shosho as a dishwasher, Valentine soon re-hires her as a dancer, and with her remarkable beauty, exotic poses, and scanty costumes she makes a great hit for the club.  Not surprisingly, Mable does not take this well, particularly when she discovers that Valentine is seeing Shosho on the sly.  She quits the club and tells Valentine to leave her; later, however, she goes to Shosho to beg her to return Valentine.  The consequences are unfortunate, to say the least.Although Gilda Gray, a noted stage actress of the era, receives star billing, this is very much Anna May Wong's film, and although the story is commonplace she is remarkable in the role of Shosho, who goes from a drab and somewhat shy kitchen maid to a cat-like seductress as the film progresses, and her final scenes in the film equal the best work of the best actresses of the era.  The supporting cast is also very good, and the film's chief flaw is a rather abrupt ending that doesn't entirely resolve all the relationships in a truly satisfactory manner.  PICCADILLY may not quite rank with the truly great silent films, but it comes close, and although Anna May Wong would continue in film for another decade--she made yet another tremendous impact in the 1932 SHANGHAI EXPRESS--but in spite of her European success she would continue to struggle for decent roles in Hollywood until her death, most often finding herself relegated to ""dragon lady"" parts in minor features.  It is a tremendous pity, for as PICCADILLY demonstrates, she did indeed have talent, beauty, and star quality.The picture elements are quite good.  The bonuses include a talkie prologue to the film, the composer's commentary on creating a new score for the movie, and a pannel discussion of Anna May Wong's career (the sound is terrible.)

An interesting plot, dealing with sex and murder, and the allure of Anna May Wong make this film worth your while.A nightclub owner, Mr. Wilmot, sees his fortunes decline after, out of jealousy, he fires the male dancing partner of Mabel.  Mabel isn't popular enough on her own to sustain the club, and so he offers a Chinese dishwasher named Shosho (played by Wong) a shot at performing.Shosho's Oriental dance is a big hit with the customers, and she is also a big hit with Mr. Wilmot, replacing Mabel as his love interest.  Wilmot's relationship with Shushu stokes jealousy in both Mabel and Shushu's Chinese ex-boyfriend.Anna May Wong makes the film with her formidable stage presence and radiant beauty.  She is very, very sexy in this film. When she is on the screen, you can't take your eyes off of her!It is very interesting to see how sex was censored in those days.  In one scene, where Shushu invites Wilmot up to her room, she very seductively streches out on her couch. Her sexy tease goes on until the two seem to explode in passion. But just as their faces are about to meet in a violent kiss, the scene comes to an abrupt end and we are shown Wilmot leaving her apartment in the morning.[Unfortunately, the makers of this DVD have a drawing of a topless Anna May Wong on the DVD case.

877351,A106016KSI0YQ,B000777HUW,Jay Dickson,"[7, 7]","Other than the films of Hitchcock, there was little to distinguish the early British cinema until the films of Powell and Pressberger, but this gorgeous thriller from 1929 is a clear exception to this rule. Heavily influenced by German Expressionism, PICCADILLY is based on an Arnold Bennett story and is told as a kind of murder mystery in reverse (you know something bad's going to happen, but you're not sure to who and by whom until the end when one of the characters is murdered by another). The milieu is the very modern Jazz Age world of a Piccadilly nightclub, where a pair of dancer headliners, Vic and Mabel, are fighting over Mabel's affair with the club's owner, Valentine, and a Chinese girl from Limehouse, Sho Sho, works in the scullery dreaming of dancing onstage. The film has been reissued because of the much overdue renewal of interest in the great Anna May Wing, who plays the fascinating Sho Sho (her performance deserves comparison with Louise Brooks's in a similar role of the same year in THE CANARY MURDER CASE), but the film is of great interest because of its stunning cinematography and direction, shown to great effect on this beautifully restored print. The director and cameramen made spectacular use of lighting, depth of field, and mise-en-scene, to give the nightclub and Sho Sho's and Val's apartments amazingly dense texture and brilliance. There are shots that almost stop your heart with their beauty, such as one of light bouncing off the facets of an old glass doorknob. The script is also very astute in terms of its handling of racial tensions, and there's a remarkable sequence when Val and Sho Sho go to a divey dance club where a white woman is banished for dancing with a black man, with chilling implications for the budding romance between Val and Sho Sho. The DVD contains as an extra a panel discussion of Anna May Wong's career among several Asian-American actors and scholars: it looked to be very interesteing, but the miking in this extra is so horrible that the comments are almost inaudible.",4,Astonishing Expressionist British silent,1117670400,"06 2, 2005",2005,2048,"['Other', 'films', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'little', 'distinguish', 'early', 'British', 'cinema', 'films', 'Powell', 'Pressberger', 'gorgeous', 'thriller', '1929', 'clear', 'exception', 'rule', 'Heavily', 'influenced', 'German', 'Expressionism', 'PICCADILLY', 'based', 'Arnold', 'Bennett', 'story', 'told', 'kind', 'murder', 'mystery', 'reverse', 'know', 'something', 'bad', 'going', 'happen', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'whom', 'end', 'when', 'one', 'characters', 'murdered', 'milieu', 'very', 'modern', 'Jazz', 'Age', 'world', 'Piccadilly', 'nightclub', 'where', 'pair', 'dancer', 'headliners', 'Vic', 'Mabel', 'are', 'fighting', 'Mabel', 'affair', 'club', 'owner', 'Valentine', 'Chinese', 'girl', 'Limehouse', 'Sho', 'Sho', 'scullery', 'dreaming', 'dancing', 'onstage', 'film', 'been', 'reissued', 'much', 'overdue', 'renewal', 'interest', 'great', 'Anna', 'May', 'Wing', 'who', 'fascinating', 'Sho', 'Sho', 'performance', 'comparison', 'Louise', 'Brooks', 'similar', 'role', 'same', 'year', 'THE', 'CANARY', 'MURDER', 'CASE', 'film', 'great', 'interest', 'stunning', 'cinematography', 'direction', 'shown', 'great', 'effect', 'beautifully', 'restored', 'print', 'director', 'cameramen', 'made', 'spectacular', 'use', 'lighting', 'depth', 'field', 'mise-en-scene', 'give', 'nightclub', 'Sho', 'Sho', 'Val', 'apartments', 'amazingly', 'dense', 'texture', 'brilliance', 'are', 'shots', 'almost', 'stop', 'heart', 'beauty', 'such', 'one', 'light', 'bouncing', 'off', 'facets', 'old', 'glass', 'doorknob', 'script', 'also', 'very', 'astute', 'terms', 'handling', 'racial', 'tensions', 'remarkable', 'sequence', 'when', 'Val', 'Sho', 'Sho', 'go', 'divey', 'dance', 'club', 'where', 'white', 'woman', 'banished', 'dancing', 'black', 'man', 'chilling', 'implications', 'budding', 'romance', 'Val', 'Sho', 'Sho', 'DVD', 'extra', 'panel', 'discussion', 'Anna', 'May', 'Wong', 'career', 'several', 'Asian-American', 'actors', 'scholars', 'looked', 'be', 'very', 'interesteing', 'miking', 'extra', 'so', 'horrible', 'comments', 'are', 'almost', 'inaudible']",N/A

877353,A8T21IR0E5JJI,B000777HUW,"Jery Tillotson ""author""","[7, 7]","I was totally amazed with this movie experience. ""Piccadilly"" was released in l929, just as talkies were coming into vogue, but when you watch this beautifully restored movie, you'll be amazed at what genius/producer E.A. Dupont and his cast and crew did. Cameraman Werner Brandt and set designer, Alfred Junge, stun the viewer with the intricate camera shots and movements. The camera passes over a row of women in the club's dressing room as they put on their make-up...then the camera tracks former Ziegfeld hotcha dancer, Gilda Gray, as she performs her routine. Later, you see Anna May Wong, dancing down in the scullery of the club, and to no one's surprise she is transformed into an Oriental beauty and becomes a smash hit. While all the attention from film buffs and historians is being lavished on Wong, I thought the voluptuous, beautiful and sexy Gilda Gray was just as good. She was famous/notorious for her Shimmy Dance and which made her millions before the Great Depression wiped her out. Here, you watch her in ravishing gowns, dresses, jewels, hairstyles, furs and she comes across bigger than life. A real woman and not one of those flat-chested flappers who were all the vogue at the time. Wong plays the quiet, deep ShoSho with fascinating mastery. In many shots, she looks exactly like Louise Brooks with her page boy hairstyle. The movie itself is enormously expressionistic, surreal and lit magnificently. Each scene is like a painting by a master. One of the extras is the clumsy, akward ten-minute spoken prologue--a nod to the talkies. The movie begins with striking elan as the credits are painted on the sides of double-decker buses in London's Piccadilly Circus. TimeLine has done another masterful job of bringing this long forgotten treasure out into the real world. Another extraordinary movie treasure presented by TimeLine is ""The Olive Thomas Collection,"" another must-see for fans of all persuasions--whether you're a silent buff or not.

877359,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B000777HUW,Paul McGrath,"[0, 0]","It&#8217;s a shame that, primarily due to her race, Anna May Wong never really achieved any lasting, worldwide fame.  Born in 1905, she was of an age with Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Claudette Colbert, to name just a few of the big actresses of that era.  In a different age and place, Anna May Wong would have been as big as any of them.I only learned about her when I stumbled upon the &#8220;Shanghai Express&#8221; film with Marlene Dietrich on television one night.  While it is considered Dietrich&#8217;s breakout film, I found that I was far more interested in the sultry, exotic Anna May Wong, who plays a fellow train passenger.  So I did a little digging around on the internet and learned a little bit about her life and career.The next step of course was to see her in action, so I rented Picadilly a few nights ago to see what the fuss was about.  Picadilly is a silent film, an eighty-four year old film, so, to a certain degree I wasn&#8217;t expecting much.  But it&#8217;s actually pretty good.  The story line is straightforward and compelling, it&#8217;s well-directed and carefully edited, it&#8217;s beautifully photographed, and it's interesting from a historical standpoint as well.But the big revelation is Anna May Wong.  Again, I wasn&#8217;t expecting much, but I found myself completely captivated.  She is, frankly, breathtaking.  In her first scene, she mesmerizes us with a dance in the kitchen at which she washes dishes&#8212;the camera does a slow pan from her ankles to her face--while her co-workers look on in fascination.  In the next, she looks like she could have been in the Mary Tyler Moore show forty years later, fresh-looking and smartly dressed in her tight-fitting skirt, fashionable sweater and beret.  The next scene is her big dance in the club--with her exotic east-Asian outfit--and it is spectacular.  She is simply delectable, and she is a splendid dancer as well.  At the end of the dance the camera pans over the audience which is applauding furiously, and for once this is not some phony movie put-on, her dance is worthy of it.  Next we find her slumming in a middle-class dance-hall wearing a white fur collar high on her cheekbones which frames her lovely face.  Finally, there is the love scene, with her in yet another exotic costume, eyeing her lover slyly, and slinking seductively on the couch.  She is not only beautiful and desirable, she is glamorous in every sense of the word, and as glamorous as any Hollywood star ever was.  Elizabeth Taylor glamorous;  Sophia Loren glamorous.And she&#8217;s a great actress, too.  In silent films, as others have pointed out, the actors quite often overact to emphasize an emotion, and although Anna occasionally overdoes it a bit, for the most part her performance is nuanced.  Her eyes alone speak volumes.Having said this, the film is flawed in one very serious way, which is the musical score.  Picadilly is not necessarily a musical, but it is a film in which music plays a prominent role.  In the movie&#8217;s opening there is a panorama of a swanky dance club, with well-dressed patrons dancing in front of an orchestra.  After we are introduced to the main characters, the first big dance number comes up and there is a close-up of the drummer&#8212;obviously signifying a change of tempo in the music&#8212;before the dance partners appear.  For Anna&#8217;s first dance, she insists on being accompanied by a few Chinese instruments, and the camera briefly focuses on a Chinese person playing a stringed Chinese instrument.  And finally, at the bawdy dance-hall, we are meant to know that it is an entirely more raucous type of music being played.  So there are at least four different variations of music here.  How nice it would have been to hear it played!But no, the musical score of the film does not change at all.  And worse, it is a slow-tempo, soft jazzy thing, reminiscent of station breaks during early-sixties, late-night American television.  It is that awful, and utterly discordant with the lively 1920&#8217;s.  And really, how difficult would it have been for someone to do even the most tiny bit of research necessary to determine what popular music was in the 1920s?  Heck, give me a day or two and even I could do a better job.  I don&#8217;t know what they were thinking, but it practically ruins the film.But don&#8217;t pass this up.

It doesn't drag.Beautifully shot and so modern with its images.  Needless to say, Anna May is so beautiful in this film.  Perky, defiant, and exotic.  It was wonderful seeing how good a silent film actress she was.  Her facial expressions were timeless!The story had some holes and the picture quality was adequate.  There were a few minor scenes with scratches and jumpiness but overall, it was pleasant to watch.I docked a half star for the really annoying (to me) modern soundtrack that was done for the movie.  I really didn't like it.  The repeat over and over again of certain songs began to get to me halfway.otherwise, a classic silent film to be enjoyed especially if you have interest in anna may wong!",5,(4.5 stars) wonderfully fresh British silent film,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",2007,818,"['Fantastic', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'film', 'very', 'refreshing', 'silent', ""n't"", 'drag.Beautifully', 'shot', 'so', 'modern', 'images', 'Needless', 'say', 'Anna', 'May', 'so', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Perky', 'defiant', 'exotic', 'was', 'wonderful', 'seeing', 'how', 'good', 'silent', 'film', 'actress', 'was', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', 'timeless', 'story', 'had', 'holes', 'picture', 'quality', 'was', 'adequate', 'were', 'few', 'minor', 'scenes', 'scratches', 'jumpiness', 'overall', 'was', 'pleasant', 'watch.I', 'docked', 'half', 'star', 'really', 'annoying', 'modern', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'done', 'movie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'over', 'again', 'certain', 'songs', 'began', 'get', 'halfway.otherwise', 'classic', 'silent', 'film', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'especially', 'have', 'interest', 'anna', 'may', 'wong']",N/A

Piccadilly not only features Miss Wong, but has an interesting, very dramatic storyline. I love the subtleties, such as the way Anna May's stockings are torn in her dancing in the scullery scene. Sexy, but trashy..The film has enough &#34;sexiness&#34; to it without being in your face. I don't know why the cover shows a woman (Anna May?) dancing with her breasts uncovered. I've seen the film many times and there isn't a scene such as the one depicted on the cover art. Why cheapen a great movie with a false &#34;hook&#34;?",5,Anna May Wong! Interesting Storyline!
