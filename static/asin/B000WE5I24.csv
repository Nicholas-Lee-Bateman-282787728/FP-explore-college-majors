1108863,A3F9VH8916IA40,B000WE5I24,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[8, 11]","This is a review for the show, not this set.(Quotes are paraphrasing, not exact wording).Welcome to the Social Welfare Agency, a top secret part of the Italian government which, despite its name, has absolutely nothing to do with the Social Welfare of the nation's people. Instead, this agency deals with terrorists, the mob, and other such criminal organizations, by assassinating their leaders.Now meet Harrietta, possibly the cutest little girl in the world, trained by the government to be the perfect killing machine, a weapon of war and destruction, a tool and nothing more. She is the perfect weapon, skilled in her trade, unquestionably devoted to her handler, Josay, able to go unnoticed because of her innocent and harmless appearance. After her parents were brutally murdered she was taken in by the Agency, her memory wiped clean, her organic body replaced with cyborg parts making her very much like Darth Vader fromStar Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Edition with Bonus Disc)or the Major fromGhost in the Shell. She is a tool to be used and disposed of when her usefulness is done, but at the same time she is still the little girls she once was.Gunslinger Girl is a show that I've been meaning to see for some time now. I've known about it since I started watching anime two years ago, but not until now have I had a chance to actually sit down and watch it. I thought I'd like it, after all sad and depressing anime's likeNow and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set)and There"" andGrave of the Fireflies (2-Disc Collector's Edition)are among my all time favorites, but I had no idea how completely amazed I'd be with it.Let's get the obvious out of the way; this is one shockingly grotesque show. Think about it, it's about little girls, some maybe as young as ten, being transformed from cute little school children into coldly efficient killing machines. Is there anything more disturbing then seeing a little pre adolescent girl wielding a machine gun and killing at will dozens of people? Is there anything sadder then said girl pleading to be allowed to do so again?""I know I've only killed six people this month, but last month I killed at least twenty, so can't I come back to work?""Although this show relies on its action and disturbing content early on to draw the viewer into the story, it doesn't dwell on it throughout the shows entirety. It isn't about the gun slinging at all, it's about the gunslingers and their handlers. None of the characters are wasted, especially the cyborg girls, each of whom received adequate detail to their characters and plenty of history. Herrietta, Triela, Ricko, Clide, Angelica, even the reclusive and barley mentioned Elsa (who looks a lot like Sara from ""Now and Then, Here and There"") were treated with just enough love and care to make their characters more then killing machines and into confused, emotional, and caring little girls simply doing their best to please those they love and feel needed. Their stories are the real meaning for this shows existence. One was born paralyzed; another was nearly killed by her parents who needed the insurance money. One by one their stories unfold. Each character has at least one episode devoted to them with Harrietta acting as the sometimes silent, sometimes active observer. Unlike other shows which try this approach, such asAir TV, Volume 1, these characters aren't dropped once they've produced the desired emotional effect. They all have a part to play in this story; each one relies on the others in order for the show to move forward. They need each other. But despite the attention to detail put into each character, in the end its Harrietta's story. She is the common denominator which glues the characters and events to one another.Where the emotional stories lie exclusively with the cyborg girls, the moral, ethical, and philosophical dilemmas are for the ""handlers,"" the men whose job it is to raise, train, supervise, and care for the girls, to deal with, and they are as different from one another as the girls they train. Josay, Harrietta's handler, feels guilty about the dehumanizing conditioning the girls are forced to go though and tries his best to alleviate that guilt by trading Harrietta as a little sister. He takes her on vacations to the Italian countryside, buys her expensive gifts, and tries his best to have her act as if she were a normal little girl. But deep down he knows that he, and the agency he serves, is merely using her as a tool; a means to an end. He deals with this guilt more and more as Herrietta's affection and emotional attachment to him grow stronger. He is a man torn between his duty and his love and affection for her.Other handlers deal with their girls very differently. Some act cold and menacing towards their girls in order to instill fear and discipline, others simply treat then as if they were machines.""They're cool and all; they can get you a soda if you ask them to, but it doesn't go beyond that to me.""No matter what the approach they take, the girls always develop a strong emotional attachment to their handlers and desire their affection above all else, with devastating consequences sometimes.The animation in this show may not be flashy, but it's more then adequate for a show of this nature. The battle scenes are done extremely well, as one would expect, as well as the stunning scenery of Italy. The characters are drawn as cute as possible to make their action all the more shocking. The music isn't worth making a big deal out of. Although the background music serves its purpose and sets the mood very effectively, it isn't something to listen to by itself. It's rather simplistic. The opening and closing songs are likewise less then noteworthy.Gunslinger Girl is not a show to be missed. Although it is very much like Ghost in the Shell in regards to the philosophical questions it raises, the depth of its characters and the attention to detail the creators put into making them is well worth the time, energy, and money. It may not be the best anime ever made, but it certainly is one of them. Good to see a depressing anime that doesn't drop the ball at the end.Questions to ponder while watching.1. Is Josay, Harrietta's handler, a moral person? Is his using Harrietta as a tool negated by the fact that he tries to make her happy? If he makes Harrietta happy, is he still acting immorally by using her, as the agencies pawn, as a tool?2. Are the girls really human? If so, then why? What is it that makes them still human beings?3. Do the ends justify the means? Does the fact that the agency uses these girls to foil potential terrorist plots which could kill innocent people make it right to use these girls as tools and weapons?Replay value;

1108864,A2PZR47924LE6T,B000WE5I24,Screw Amazon,"[2, 3]","I remember way back when I first saw a promo artwork for Gunslinger Girl produced by Mangaka Yu Aida.  It was shot of Rico, holding across her shoulders her sniper rifle.  But what caught my eye was the look in her eyes.  I'd seen that look before, and it only took a quick search of Amnesty International's website to find where I'd see this look before.In Rwanda in the past decade, the use of Children as soldiers has been rampant.  Children are often conscripted, given drugs and turned into little efficient killers, many as young as eight years old.  Doing a quick Google search in images for ""child soldiers"" will return dozens of photos of these young children, and there for all to see is that same look that you see in Rico's eyes.  There's a devastated look, of a childhood drastically altered in the name of a revolution that simply doesn't care about it's young pawns.  It's a sad epitaph that humans often create for themselves in the atrocities we invent, particularly when it involves the subjugation of our young.This is why I believe that Gunslinger Girl is such an important piece.  Set in Modern Italy in a time of terrorism and idealism run amok, once again human beings are doing what they do best.  In the interest of winning what may be an unwinnable battle, the Italian government makes what is at once a morally repugnant yet thoroughly and tactically brilliant move:  Use children as weapons of war.  The story picks up in the middle of the situation and we're introduced to two of the main Characters.  Henrietta is a young girl who witnessed the death of her family and was assaulted by the very people who murdered them.  Jose is the ""Handler"" who chooses her to be his charge because of the death of his own younger sister at the hands of terrorists.Although at first the premise seems far fetched, once we begin to realize just how depraved human beings can be when it comes to the desire to win at all costs, the possibility of this kind of thing actually taking place feels more plausible.  Cybernetics has made great strides in recent years, so it's not beyond the realm of possibility that such Cyborg assassins could one day be created.  And what's more, given our propensity as a race to subjugate our own, it's not at all unlikely that we might use children as the guinea pigs in such an experiment.Once the viewer is over the shock of seeing a child become a cold blooded killer, it doesn't take long before we realize what Yu Aida is doing as a writer.  He's mining the depths of human depravity as a contrast to highlight the potential good that humans can display.  The author puts us into a situation that seems to be impossible to redeem, and in doing so can tell stories unlike what can be told in other genres.  Each Girl becomes an archetype of the human condition.  Unrequited love (Elsa), unrealized desire (Henrietta), frolicking gratitude (Rico), searching for purpose (Claes), dying for approval (Angelica), seeking stability (Triela), and each of these archetypes are coupled with it's antithesis in their handlers.One example of this antithesis is in the relationship between Jose and Henrietta.  Henrietta desires to be close to Jose, but Jose is caught between his need to help his young charge and the revenge he sought in choosing her.  A line from the manga reveals that Jose did this so that his dead sister could enact revenge upon those who killed her through Henrietta.Don't let other reviewers confuse you about the pathos of this series.  For instance, at the end of the series as Angelica listens to Beethoven's 9th Symphony, right at the point where it seems like she dies we can hear the choir singing ""Br&uuml;der, &uuml;ber'm Sternenzelt Muss ein lieber Vater wohnen"" (Brothers, above the starry canopy a loving Father dwells)...  In Florence, when Jean and Rico meet up with Philipo Adani, Philipo explains to Rico the significance of the sculpture ""The Rape of the Sabien Woman"";  explains it to a young girl who herself has been carried off, or stolen, for a purpose less than noble.  This series is rich in it's telling, magnificent in it's scope, and full of impact in it's emotional heart of hearts.But most of all, the story is very real.  No, we can't make cyborgs like these girls yet, but we can turn them into soldiers.  No, we can't rebuild a destroyed life through technology yet, but we can with careful nurturing make a difference in a destroyed human life.  We can wonder, as one Character says ""I'm laughing at the thought of these little girls, who can kill terrorists and speak three languages, Standing in the bitter cold singing Beethoven""...  he continues, ""it's a shame they have to be cyborgs"".  Gunslinger Girl brings a unique perspective to the human condition, at once depressing and invigorating.It's a must see.",5,Echoes of Real life:  How Gunslinger Girl exposes human nature at it's worst and best.,1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,4811,"['remember', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'promo', 'artwork', 'Gunslinger', 'Girl', 'produced', 'Mangaka', 'Yu', 'Aida', 'was', 'shot', 'Rico', 'holding', 'shoulders', 'sniper', 'rifle', 'what', 'caught', 'eye', 'was', 'look', 'eyes', ""'d"", 'seen', 'look', 'only', 'took', 'quick', 'search', 'Amnesty', 'International', 'website', 'find', 'where', ""'d"", 'see', 'look', 'Rwanda', 'past', 'decade', 'use', 'Children', 'soldiers', 'been', 'rampant', 'Children', 'are', 'often', 'conscripted', 'given', 'drugs', 'turned', 'little', 'efficient', 'killers', 'many', 'as', 'young', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'Doing', 'quick', 'Google', 'search', 'images', 'child', 'soldiers', 'will', 'return', 'dozens', 'photos', 'young', 'children', 'there', 'see', 'same', 'look', 'see', 'Rico', 'eyes', 'devastated', 'look', 'childhood', 'drastically', 'altered', 'name', 'revolution', 'simply', ""n't"", 'care', 'young', 'pawns', 'sad', 'epitaph', 'humans', 'often', 'create', 'atrocities', 'invent', 'particularly', 'when', 'subjugation', 'young.This', 'why', 'believe', 'Gunslinger', 'Girl', 'such', 'important', 'piece', 'Set', 'Modern', 'Italy', 'time', 'terrorism', 'idealism', 'run', 'amok', 'once', 'again', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'interest', 'winning', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'unwinnable', 'battle', 'Italian', 'government', 'what', 'once', 'morally', 'repugnant', 'thoroughly', 'tactically', 'brilliant', 'move', 'Use', 'children', 'weapons', 'war', 'story', 'up', 'middle', 'situation', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'two', 'main', 'Characters', 'Henrietta', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'witnessed', 'death', 'family', 'was', 'assaulted', 'very', 'people', 'who', 'murdered', 'Jose', 'Handler', 'who', 'be', 'charge', 'death', 'own', 'younger', 'sister', 'hands', 'terrorists.Although', 'first', 'premise', 'far', 'fetched', 'once', 'begin', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'depraved', 'human', 'beings', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'desire', 'win', 'costs', 'possibility', 'kind', 'thing', 'actually', 'taking', 'place', 'feels', 'more', 'plausible', 'Cybernetics', 'made', 'great', 'strides', 'recent', 'years', 'not', 'realm', 'possibility', 'such', 'Cyborg', 'assassins', 'could', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'created', 'what', 'more', 'given', 'propensity', 'race', 'subjugate', 'own', 'not', 'unlikely', 'might', 'use', 'children', 'guinea', 'pigs', 'such', 'experiment.Once', 'viewer', 'shock', 'seeing', 'child', 'become', 'cold', 'blooded', 'killer', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'realize', 'what', 'Yu', 'Aida', 'doing', 'writer', 'mining', 'depths', 'human', 'depravity', 'contrast', 'highlight', 'potential', 'good', 'humans', 'can', 'display', 'author', 'situation', 'be', 'impossible', 'redeem', 'doing', 'so', 'can', 'tell', 'stories', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'other', 'genres', 'Girl', 'archetype', 'human', 'condition', 'Unrequited', 'love', 'Elsa', 'unrealized', 'desire', 'Henrietta', 'frolicking', 'gratitude', 'Rico', 'searching', 'purpose', 'Claes', 'dying', 'approval', 'Angelica', 'seeking', 'stability', 'Triela', 'archetypes', 'are', 'coupled', 'antithesis', 'handlers.One', 'example', 'antithesis', 'relationship', 'Jose', 'Henrietta', 'Henrietta', 'be', 'close', 'Jose', 'Jose', 'caught', 'need', 'help', 'young', 'charge', 'revenge', 'sought', 'choosing', 'line', 'manga', 'Jose', 'did', 'so', 'dead', 'sister', 'could', 'enact', 'revenge', 'who', 'killed', 'Henrietta.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'other', 'reviewers', 'confuse', 'pathos', 'series', 'instance', 'end', 'series', 'Angelica', 'Beethoven', '9th', 'Symphony', 'right', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'hear', 'choir', 'singing', 'Br', 'uuml', 'der', 'uuml', ""'m"", 'Sternenzelt', 'Muss', 'lieber', 'Vater', 'wohnen', 'Brothers', 'starry', 'loving', 'Father', 'dwells', 'Florence', 'when', 'Jean', 'Rico', 'meet', 'up', 'Philipo', 'Adani', 'Philipo', 'Rico', 'significance', 'sculpture', 'Rape', 'Sabien', 'Woman', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'carried', 'off', 'stolen', 'purpose', 'less', 'noble', 'series', 'rich', 'telling', 'magnificent', 'scope', 'full', 'impact', 'emotional', 'heart', 'hearts.But', 'most', 'story', 'very', 'real', 'No', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'cyborgs', 'girls', 'yet', 'can', 'turn', 'soldiers', 'No', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rebuild', 'destroyed', 'life', 'technology', 'yet', 'can', 'careful', 'nurturing', 'make', 'difference', 'destroyed', 'human', 'life', 'can', 'wonder', 'one', 'Character', ""'m"", 'laughing', 'thought', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'can', 'kill', 'terrorists', 'speak', 'three', 'languages', 'Standing', 'bitter', 'cold', 'singing', 'Beethoven', 'shame', 'have', 'be', 'cyborgs', 'Gunslinger', 'Girl', 'unique', 'perspective', 'human', 'condition', 'once', 'depressing', 'invigorating.It', 'must', 'see']",N/A
1108865,A96JD9312DHWC,B000WE5I24,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[6, 6]","Welcome to Secton 2, where the assassins are both proficient and hard to spot. That's because, in addition to having cybernetic enhancements and mindwipes to keep them conditioned, they are also little girls. If looked at as a morality issue, don't worry: Section 2 takes good care of their young killers. They assign each of them a ""brother"" to watch after their development, take only the worst cases and actually give them back life, and they work for the ""betterment"" of society. So what if nobody is allowed to see them in action, that innocents are sometimes killed, and if the lifespan of the girls can be altered if too much conditioning is used?At least they get another chance at life.It has been a while since I've seen an anime that was so collectively complete. Many stop taking lessons from prior shows and just get into killing, and others take the opposite approach and only look at life through political eyes. Gunslinger Girl does both of these and does it in a unique way: instead of having one point-of-view throughout the series, you see life through the girls and the brothers and other people that are involved in various incidents. This means that you see the problems that arise when connections run too deep, when a brother doesn't care, when things spin out-of-control, and through a variety of other measures. The art is superb, the stories are always good and keep building the characters throughout the process, and each person in the show is different. Gunslinger Girl makes sure to make each person a life unto themselves: they do not want confusion to reign, nor do they want generic copies to rule the day.To say I recommend the series is an understatement. I sat down one day and watched the whole series all the way through, then say down again and watched it with others. As I did I caught little things that compounded in the stories, giving me a different perspective each time I watched. That meant that it felt like a new assault on my senses each time, with a range of emotions accompanying each show. If you have never checked out the series, this is a good way to do it. The set is really affordable now, is perfect for watching, and leaves little to chance when it comes to design.
