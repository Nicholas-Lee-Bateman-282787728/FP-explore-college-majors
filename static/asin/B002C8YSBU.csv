1262444,A1AD9GUL4O81UO,B002C8YSBU,AlexsDad,"[2, 2]","Rhoda's seccond season builds on the first. Rhoda is married to Joe with her sister Brenda living downstairs, and the drunken Carlton in the lobby. Nancy Walker and Harold Gould are semi-regulars as her parents. From what I have read, the writers had difficulty writing Rhoda as a married woman, so there were a decent number of episodes that featured the single, Rhoda-esque Brenda. The show is a typical MTM production, which is enjoyable character-based comedy. Even when the shows are not laugh out loud funny, the dialogue is humorous and clever.There are some outstanding episodes and guest stars, including the one and only Ruth Gordon, as Carlton's mother, a bag lady. Vivian Vance, whom I adore, guest starred as a new neighbor with whom Rhoda strikes up a close friendship. Because Vivian is around Ida's age, Ida becomes insanely jealous. Other guest stars include Eileen Heckart, John Ritter, and Normall Fell, who plays Ida's doctor with whom she becomes emotionally involved.One disappointment was that there were no crossover appearances with Mary Tyler Moore this season. Valerie Harper and David Groh do make an appearance on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"".",5,I LOVE Rhoda,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",2013,1171,"['Rhoda', 'seccond', 'season', 'builds', 'first', 'Rhoda', 'married', 'Joe', 'sister', 'Brenda', 'living', 'downstairs', 'drunken', 'Carlton', 'lobby', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'Harold', 'Gould', 'are', 'semi-regulars', 'parents', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'writers', 'had', 'difficulty', 'writing', 'Rhoda', 'married', 'woman', 'were', 'decent', 'number', 'episodes', 'featured', 'single', 'Rhoda-esque', 'Brenda', 'show', 'typical', 'MTM', 'production', 'enjoyable', 'character-based', 'comedy', 'Even', 'when', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'humorous', 'are', 'outstanding', 'episodes', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'one', 'only', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'Carlton', 'mother', 'bag', 'lady', 'Vivian', 'Vance', 'whom', 'adore', 'guest', 'starred', 'new', 'neighbor', 'whom', 'Rhoda', 'up', 'close', 'friendship', 'Vivian', 'Ida', 'age', 'Ida', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'Other', 'guest', 'stars', 'include', 'Eileen', 'Heckart', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Normall', 'Fell', 'who', 'Ida', 'doctor', 'whom', 'emotionally', 'involved.One', 'disappointment', 'was', 'were', 'crossover', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'season', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'David', 'Groh', 'do', 'make', 'appearance', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show']",Rhoda: Season 2

RHODA made one huge mistake in season one:  getting her married so soon, so fast.  Why??  Was it the network?  the producers??  Harper herself?  The ratings held up for Season 2 but CBS/producers felt that viewers wanted Rhoda single, not Rhoda married, so the season is bittersweet in that poor Joe does not last much in Season 3.  I wish the wedding took place in Season 2 and perhaps a baby in Season 4.  Can you imagine Ida as a grandma?  There was much potential in the show in re to the themes that could have been discussed--being a stepmother, being a wife and wanting a career in the 1970s in NYC, et al., but instead the scripts in Season 2 were very generic and could have been used in any other show at the time.  The pluses are the strong cast and guest spots, including one of the last bits by the great Vivian Vance.",3,See the quality start to slide. . .,1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,914,"['Sad', 'say', 'show', 'could', 'not', 'keep', 'sharp', 'smart', 'sparks', 'Season', '1', 'RHODA', 'made', 'one', 'huge', 'mistake', 'season', 'one', 'getting', 'married', 'so', 'soon', 'fast', 'Why', 'Was', 'network', 'producers', 'Harper', 'ratings', 'held', 'up', 'Season', '2', 'CBS/producers', 'felt', 'viewers', 'wanted', 'Rhoda', 'single', 'not', 'Rhoda', 'married', 'season', 'bittersweet', 'poor', 'Joe', 'not', 'last', 'much', 'Season', '3', 'wish', 'wedding', 'took', 'place', 'Season', '2', 'perhaps', 'baby', 'Season', '4', 'Can', 'imagine', 'Ida', 'grandma', 'was', 'much', 'potential', 'show', 're', 'themes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'discussed', 'being', 'stepmother', 'being', 'wife', 'wanting', 'career', '1970s', 'NYC', 'et', 'al.', 'instead', 'scripts', 'Season', '2', 'were', 'very', 'generic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'other', 'show', 'time', 'pluses', 'are', 'strong', 'cast', 'guest', 'spots', 'including', 'one', 'last', 'bits', 'great', 'Vivian', 'Vance']",Rhoda: Season 2

1262455,A2L8EMOWEJX98N,B002C8YSBU,Pageturner in NYC,"[26, 26]","I got an advance copy of the DVD set and it's great! Four DVDs (containing all 24 season two episodes) in two plastic cases slide inside a cardboard slipcase. All episodes have been vibrantly remastered and are uncut (running times are almost always 24 mins and 55 seconds). This is a big improvement over season one, that had too many edited-for-syndication episodes (including a cameo appearance of Mary Tyler Moore playing Mary Richards in the pilot episode!). Almost every season of RHODA had a slightly different theme song--season one had the ""My name is Rhoda Morganstern..."" opening; season two replaces her narration with ""La-la-la-la-la""s. Guests this season include Ruth Gordon (an EMMY nominated performance as Carlton the doorman's mother), Vivian Vance, Jack Gilford, Eileen Heckert, John Ritter, Norman Fell (as a doctor Ida thinks she's having an affair with), Tim Matheson, Joan Van Ark (as Joe's first wife) and Ron SIlver (but not as Gary Levy). This second season is filled with hilarious, well-written episodes. Besides Ruth Gordon's nomination, this 1975--76 season earned EMMY nominations for Valerie Harper (she'd won the previous year), Julie Kavner (who'd finally win in the fourth season), and Nancy Walker (who earned 7 EMMY nominations between McMILLAN & WIFE, RHODA and a guest shot on THE GOLDEN GIRLS--and never won; she was the Thelma Ritter of TV). Sadly, there's no extras (you'd think Valerie Harper would be happy to do a commentary or two or film a short rememberance of the series). But the set is beautiful looking, unedited, and still wildly funny.",5,"Vibrant, remastered UNEDITED hilarious second season",1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,1589,"['got', 'advance', 'copy', 'DVD', 'set', 'great', 'Four', 'DVDs', 'containing', '24', 'season', 'two', 'episodes', 'two', 'plastic', 'cases', 'slide', 'cardboard', 'slipcase', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'vibrantly', 'remastered', 'are', 'uncut', 'running', 'times', 'are', 'almost', 'always', '24', 'mins', '55', 'seconds', 'big', 'improvement', 'season', 'one', 'had', 'too', 'many', 'edited-for-syndication', 'episodes', 'including', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'playing', 'Mary', 'Richards', 'pilot', 'episode', 'season', 'RHODA', 'had', 'slightly', 'different', 'theme', 'song', 'season', 'one', 'had', 'name', 'Rhoda', 'Morganstern', 'opening', 'season', 'two', 'narration', 'La-la-la-la-la', 's.', 'season', 'include', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'EMMY', 'nominated', 'performance', 'Carlton', 'doorman', 'mother', 'Vivian', 'Vance', 'Jack', 'Gilford', 'Eileen', 'Heckert', 'John', 'Ritter', 'Norman', 'Fell', 'doctor', 'Ida', 'having', 'affair', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'Joan', 'Van', 'Ark', 'Joe', 'first', 'wife', 'Ron', 'SIlver', 'not', 'Gary', 'Levy', 'second', 'season', 'filled', 'hilarious', 'well-written', 'episodes', 'Ruth', 'Gordon', 'nomination', '1975', '76', 'season', 'earned', 'EMMY', 'nominations', 'Valerie', 'Harper', ""'d"", 'won', 'previous', 'year', 'Julie', 'Kavner', 'who', ""'d"", 'finally', 'win', 'fourth', 'season', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'who', 'earned', '7', 'EMMY', 'nominations', 'McMILLAN', 'WIFE', 'RHODA', 'guest', 'shot', 'THE', 'GOLDEN', 'GIRLS', 'never', 'won', 'was', 'Thelma', 'Ritter', 'TV', 'Sadly', 'extras', ""'d"", 'think', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'do', 'commentary', 'two', 'film', 'short', 'rememberance', 'series', 'set', 'beautiful', 'looking', 'unedited', 'still', 'wildly', 'funny']",Rhoda: Season 2
