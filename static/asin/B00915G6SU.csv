When it became available, I ordered The Eighth Season hoping that I would not be disappointed in the new character, Alex Blake, or the quality of the new plots.  I found that the Alex Blake character worked well in conjunction with the established characters.  The plots were well-written and interesting -- though some plots were a bit unusual.  I don't watch TV, so I had not seen a single episode of the 8th season.  My style is to order a new season, and have a marathon when the package arrives in the mail -- watching about one complete disc at a sitting.  I read the summaries in advance, and, sometimes, skip to an episode that has a continuing theme. I am glad that I purchased Criminal Minds, The Eighth Season.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys well-written, well-acted crime-dramas.

During season eight the FBI dealt with an unsub known as the Replicator throughout this season and it kept me on the edge of my seat.,5,Criminal Minds season eight,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",2013,391,"['Criminal', 'Minds', 'always', 'been', 'excellent', 'show', 'FBI', 'profilers', 'travel', 'world', 'catch', 'serial', 'killers', 'studying', 'human', 'behavior', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'favorite', 'actor', 'program', 'other', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'too', 'show', 'season', 'eight', 'FBI', 'dealt', 'unsub', 'known', 'Replicator', 'season', 'kept', 'edge', 'seat']",Criminal Minds: Season 8
1583461,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B00915G6SU,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","""Criminal Minds"" returned for its eighth season on CBS television in the 2012-2013 with a couple of cast changes and a terrific lineup of new cases, to be solved by the special agents of the FBI's Behavior Analysis Unit (BAU).  The storylines continue to be about unique criminal mindsets, delivered by an excellent ensemble cast with well-developed characters and dynamic teamwork.At season's begining, Special Agent Emily Prentiss moves on to a choice position with Interpol, to be replaced by FBI linguists expert Alex Blake (Jeanne Tripplehorn), who brings a new set of skills to the team and some significant baggage with Assistant Director Erin Strauss, who supervises the BAU.  Alex will have an immediate impact within the team, not least in assisting Dr. Spencer Reid in a relationship with a girlfriend he has never met face to face.  The girlfriend is being stalked by an unknown person, and her story arc will be dealt with over several episodes, climaxing in a traumatic confrontation between Reid and the surprising stalker.""Criminal Minds: The Eighth Season"" continues to feature crime-of-the-week drama, in which the team flies off from FBI HQs to assist local law enforcement in tracking down a serial killer with unique psycological characteristics.  The storys involve emotionally wrenching elements and significant suspense, as the BAU races the killer or killer to his or her last victim.  Storys include insights into the lives of the team, from Hotchner's new girlfriend to Penelope's old boyfriend and much else.  There are no indications the show is running out of originality.A continuing narrative threat over the course of the season is the presence of an unknown subject who is stalking the team itself.  The unsub is first glimpsed by the audience photographing the team at work on cases.  He will eventually make his presence known baiting the team byh replicating crimes they have already solved, and by seeming to work with accomplices.  The team itself is vulnerable, in a way not seen since the Reaper went after Hotchner and his family in Season Five.  But you'll have to watch to find out what happens...""Criminal Minds: The Eighth Season"" is highly recommended to its fans.",5,A good show stays good...,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,2211,"['Criminal', 'Minds', 'returned', 'eighth', 'season', 'CBS', 'television', '2012-2013', 'couple', 'cast', 'changes', 'terrific', 'lineup', 'new', 'cases', 'be', 'solved', 'special', 'agents', 'FBI', 'Behavior', 'Analysis', 'Unit', 'BAU', 'storylines', 'continue', 'be', 'unique', 'criminal', 'mindsets', 'delivered', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'dynamic', 'teamwork.At', 'season', 'begining', 'Special', 'Agent', 'Emily', 'Prentiss', 'choice', 'position', 'Interpol', 'be', 'replaced', 'FBI', 'linguists', 'expert', 'Alex', 'Blake', 'Jeanne', 'Tripplehorn', 'who', 'new', 'set', 'skills', 'team', 'significant', 'baggage', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'Erin', 'Strauss', 'who', 'BAU', 'Alex', 'will', 'have', 'immediate', 'impact', 'team', 'not', 'least', 'assisting', 'Dr.', 'Spencer', 'Reid', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'never', 'met', 'face', 'face', 'girlfriend', 'being', 'stalked', 'unknown', 'person', 'story', 'arc', 'will', 'be', 'dealt', 'several', 'episodes', 'climaxing', 'traumatic', 'confrontation', 'Reid', 'surprising', 'stalker', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'Eighth', 'Season', 'feature', 'crime-of-the-week', 'drama', 'team', 'FBI', 'HQs', 'assist', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'tracking', 'down', 'serial', 'killer', 'unique', 'psycological', 'characteristics', 'storys', 'involve', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'elements', 'significant', 'suspense', 'BAU', 'killer', 'killer', 'last', 'victim', 'Storys', 'include', 'insights', 'lives', 'team', 'Hotchner', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Penelope', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'much', 'else', 'are', 'indications', 'show', 'running', 'out', 'originality.A', 'continuing', 'narrative', 'threat', 'course', 'season', 'presence', 'unknown', 'subject', 'who', 'stalking', 'team', 'unsub', 'first', 'glimpsed', 'audience', 'photographing', 'team', 'work', 'cases', 'will', 'eventually', 'make', 'presence', 'known', 'baiting', 'team', 'byh', 'replicating', 'crimes', 'have', 'already', 'solved', 'seeming', 'work', 'accomplices', 'team', 'vulnerable', 'way', 'not', 'seen', 'Reaper', 'went', 'Hotchner', 'family', 'Season', 'Five', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'Eighth', 'Season', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans']",Criminal Minds: Season 8

These agents always killed the suspect. The concept of Fair Trial, which is so important in the USA System of Justice is basically absent. After several episodes I started to fear both the FBI Agents and the Suspects.This being said, Criminal Minds, as a show, is well done: actors are good, the plot development is clever, etc. But my problem remains: because I respect so much USA System of Justice is painful to watch police agents being judges, jurors and executioners all at the same time.

I started watching during the first season, and while it wasn't a great show, it wasn't completely awful.  In particular, the presence of Mandy Patinkin came the show something of a moral center.  However, Mr. Patinkin had the sense to leave the show during the second season, and the program went into a long period of decline.The worst period was probably during the fourth and fifth seasons, when the show was dominated by very disturbing storylines, often directed at the members of the team itself.  At the very least, this should have brought the team to an end -- all of them were victims of PTS issues, and should have been transferred to other FBI departments.  But, since the show has to go on, Criminal Minds is left with its cast of damaged human beings.  When you combine this with the number of years the show has been in production, things have gotten pretty grim.  The writers are clearly having difficulty coming up with stories that resemble actual law enforcement.  The actors look very tired with what they are doing.  However many times can they utter the psychobabble about the ""unsub"" and expect it to mean anything?  One striking feature about the show is the way the team operates with little involvement from local law enforcement, whose knowledge of their own community usually mean they're the ones most likely to solve local crime.I know crime procedurals on TV are rarely realistic, but Criminal Minds has moved onto a largely imaginary world of bizarre killers and their own set of magical words that allow them to ""solve"" crime.  In many ways, the fact that is show has gone on for eight years and remains popular is the most disturbing thing about it.",1,worst show on television?,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,1902,"['calling', 'worst', 'show', 'TV', ""'m"", 'trying', 'make', 'calculation', 'quality', 'show', 'length', 'time', 'been', 'air', 'perhaps', 'length', 'time', 'likely', 'continue', 'started', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'awful', 'particular', 'presence', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'came', 'show', 'something', 'moral', 'center', 'However', 'Mr.', 'Patinkin', 'had', 'sense', 'leave', 'show', 'second', 'season', 'program', 'went', 'long', 'period', 'decline.The', 'worst', 'period', 'was', 'probably', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'seasons', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'dominated', 'very', 'disturbing', 'storylines', 'often', 'directed', 'members', 'team', 'very', 'least', 'should', 'have', 'brought', 'team', 'end', 'were', 'victims', 'PTS', 'issues', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'transferred', 'other', 'FBI', 'departments', 'show', 'go', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'left', 'cast', 'damaged', 'human', 'beings', 'When', 'combine', 'number', 'years', 'show', 'been', 'production', 'things', 'have', 'gotten', 'pretty', 'grim', 'writers', 'are', 'clearly', 'having', 'difficulty', 'coming', 'up', 'stories', 'resemble', 'actual', 'law', 'enforcement', 'actors', 'look', 'very', 'tired', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'However', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'utter', 'psychobabble', 'unsub', 'expect', 'mean', 'anything', 'One', 'striking', 'feature', 'show', 'way', 'team', 'little', 'involvement', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'knowledge', 'own', 'community', 'usually', 'mean', ""'re"", 'ones', 'most', 'likely', 'solve', 'local', 'crime.I', 'know', 'crime', 'procedurals', 'TV', 'are', 'rarely', 'realistic', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'moved', 'largely', 'imaginary', 'world', 'bizarre', 'killers', 'own', 'set', 'magical', 'words', 'allow', 'solve', 'crime', 'many', 'ways', 'fact', 'show', 'gone', 'eight', 'years', 'popular', 'most', 'disturbing', 'thing']",Criminal Minds: Season 8

The quality of the show has had its ups and down- the season in which Prentiss and JJ were dismissed was one of the worst. Many fans (including myself) didn't like the new agent, Seaver, who replaced the two veteran stars. But I think this season is truly worse even than Seaver's season (season 6, I think). Why? Because of the newest team member, Agent Blake. Her character is cold, dull, and has almost no sense of humor. I can't see her really bonding with the rest of the team, and in fact, she expressed a dislike for ""sensitive"" people. Does that mean she doesn't like Garcia or Morgan? They both get a bit sensitive and the cases sometimes get to them emotionally. Is she saying she'd rather work with robots?I truly hope that the show either makes some changes to Blake's character or kindly asks Tripplehorn (the actress playing Blake) to leave.And what's with the endings? Why are they always the same? What's going on with this season? Where's the creativity? And why is the unsub's identity revealed so early on?
