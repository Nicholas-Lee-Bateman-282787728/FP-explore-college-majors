We learn, from the beginning, that Raj is opposed to arranged marriages, and the very concept strikes him as very disagreeable.  He travels to Mumbai, to be at the wedding of his cousin, and has a chance encounter with a beautiful stranger, Namrata (Aishwarya Rai), on the way there.  They become reacquainted, when it turns out both of them are attending his cousin's wedding.  Namrata is hired on as his would-be ""matchmaker,"" but it turns out she might be the best match for him, after all.

906514,A2XB8M3NXW9Q0O,B0009J6OQ6,Gen Res,"[2, 3]","This movie is about Raj (Abhishek Bachan) who lives in New York. Raj's Mom and Mamaji really want him to get married. He takes a trip to India to see his cousin's wedding.  Raj's Mamaji sets up blind dates for him to meet various women.  An assistant of his Mamaji, Namrata (Aishwarya Rai) goes along with Raj on the blind dates.  Raj falls for Namrata.  But Namrata has a past.There are some definite funny parts - like the blind dates. But there were holes in the story and bad acting in some parts. Arbaaz Khan has absolutely no conviction and his voice sounds emotionless the whole time.  During most of the last half hour, Aishwarya Rai just gapes lifelessly and looks around not knowing what to do. She acts like a doormat but suddenly she gives a speech about a women's status.  Abishek Bachan is ok, he is likeable in the movie and you do get the feeling he really loves Namrata in the movie. Why does Aishwarya Rai dress in ""hip Western clothes"" in the first hour, but suddenly she switches over the saris?  And why does she slap a Sardarji who happens to walk in her direction?  And the obvious Western Union ad and the annoying Coke product placement in the movie gets tiring. The sound track is nice. Most of the movie is fun to watch, but the second half starts to slightly drag because of bad script and acting issues.",3,Kuch Na Kaho,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,1332,"['movie', 'Raj', 'Abhishek', 'Bachan', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'Raj', 'Mom', 'Mamaji', 'really', 'want', 'get', 'married', 'trip', 'India', 'see', 'cousin', 'wedding', 'Raj', 'Mamaji', 'up', 'blind', 'dates', 'meet', 'various', 'women', 'assistant', 'Mamaji', 'Namrata', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'Raj', 'blind', 'dates', 'Raj', 'Namrata', 'Namrata', 'past.There', 'are', 'definite', 'funny', 'parts', 'blind', 'dates', 'were', 'holes', 'story', 'bad', 'acting', 'parts', 'Arbaaz', 'Khan', 'absolutely', 'conviction', 'voice', 'whole', 'time', 'most', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'just', 'lifelessly', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'doormat', 'suddenly', 'speech', 'women', 'status', 'Abishek', 'Bachan', 'ok', 'likeable', 'movie', 'do', 'get', 'feeling', 'really', 'Namrata', 'movie', 'Why', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'dress', 'hip', 'Western', 'clothes', 'first', 'hour', 'suddenly', 'saris', 'why', 'slap', 'Sardarji', 'who', 'walk', 'direction', 'obvious', 'Western', 'Union', 'ad', 'annoying', 'Coke', 'product', 'placement', 'movie', 'tiring', 'sound', 'track', 'nice', 'Most', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'second', 'half', 'slightly', 'drag', 'bad', 'script', 'acting', 'issues']",Kuch Na Kaho

906516,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0009J6OQ6,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","This movie was great. Kuch Naa Kaho (Say No More) was my second bollywood movie (if you count Bride & Prejudice as full-on bollywood) and I enjoyed it so much I've actually sat through it twice already (to inform the reader, i am a manly man who lives and breathes sports; watching a 2 and half hour flick with sub-titles is a big deal for me, as well as a step up in my social evolution, 'cording to my girl). I'm not saying that I've become a full-on bollywood fan, just an ardent Aishwarya Rai slave.Anyway, the basic plot: Raj lives in America and is tricked into going to India to go to his sister's wedding, suspecting all the while that his matchmaking uncle'll try to marry him off. He meets Namrata (Aishwarya Rai) by a cute coincidence; later, Namrata is talked into guiding/babysitting the reluctant Raj as he dates the five women set up by his uncle; of course, it turns out the perfect chica for him is Namrata; but then there's a little twist...The first two hours mostly pass in comedic fashion, now and then interrupted by song & dance numbers, then it segues into soap opera drama in the final 30-40 minutes. By the way, I just realized I haven't even mentioned the lead actor's name. It is Abhishek Bachchan and, apparently, he is the son of a famous actor (the director, Rohan Sippy, is also the son of a famous director). Abhishek as Raj does a pretty good job. I found myself liking the fella, even though he was romancing the girl of my dreams (I'm sure I have a shot; after all, I am a manly man). Abhishek's sense of humor shines through (check out the ""making of"" on the bonus dvd to see how laid back and cheerful this cat is) but he also holds up well in the dramatic scenes. Some friends more refined than me and who, therefore, have seen multitudes of foreign films have commented that Kuch Naa Kaho is actually ""a refreshing confection added to the bollywood genre, flavored with up-to-date themes and values and peppered with more modern styles of music."" Me, I just get hungry with that kind of talk. The thing about a lengthy movie like this is that, if you're enjoying it, you fall deeper into the story so that by the end, you're truly wrapped up into the tale and you have a deeper investment in the characters and what befalls them. Now let's go into the movie's not so secret weapon. For that, I'm gonna start a new paragraph.Aishwarya Rai makes this movie work. I'm a layman when it comes to acting; basically, I know what I like. But, to me, Rai has that light, deft touch that is desperately needed with romantic comedies such as this. She is luminously beautiful, yet refreshingly down-to-earth. She makes the musical segments a sheer pleasure to watch. I've replayed the songs so often I could probably describe every dance step and hum every note right now...but I won't. And Omigosh her eyes! ...look, I've obviously degenerated into this rambling mode now so do yourself a favor, dear reader, and order this movie. This woman gets 10,000 e-mails daily worldwide. You're gonna make it 10,001.

906518,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B0009J6OQ6,Sean Pasek,"[0, 0]","If anyone feels that Hollywood has forgotten how to make quality films that are pleasant to watch such as the kind that Hollywood used to put out regularly up until the late 60s, then you can feel assured that Bollywood is picking up the slack.In many ways, this movie reminds me of the films that Doris Day and Rock Hudson put out, like Pillow Talk.  Abhishek Bachchan (Raj) has the suave sophistication of a Cary Grant.  He plays the role of Raj with charm, class, and sophistication.  Aishwarya Rai (Namrata) has the beauty, intelligence, and charm of an Ingrid Bergman.  The woman is multi-talented.  Rai can act, sing, dance, and speak 3-5 language fluently.  You may think these comparisons are a stretch.  Watch this movie and see for yourself.  I'm the biggest fan of both Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, and these two delightful, Bollywood actors, in my opinion for this particular movie, deserve the comparison.When was the last time you found a fun, entertaining film for the whole family that could also inspire?  More and more of these little Bollywood gems are coming to light.  Most the world is already more than aware of them.  It's only here in America that we are still a bit in the dark when it comes to International Cinema.This is a wonderful tale of Raj, who is an Indian man living and working in the United States.  The furthest thing from his mind is settling down and getting married.  His young cousin is getting married in India.  Raj knows better than to attend, because he knows that his Uncle will have a line of potential brides lined up for him a mile long!  Nikki, his cousin, brilliantly schemes a way to get him there as she bawls to him on the phone that she needs his help to break up the marriage because she doesn't love the guy.  It isn't true, of course, which leads to some hilarious misunderstandings when Raj does go and tries to find an excuse to break up the marriage.In his attempt to get to India as quickly as possible, Raj meets Namrata at the airport.  She is also going to India.  Little does he realize that she is attending the wedding as well as she is a fashion designer working for Raj's uncle.  Raj finds a way to get Namrata to give him her airline ticket by making up an incredible story about his dying son!The fun has only just begun, as Raj's uncle does, indeed, find a way to get Raj to meet eligible women.  He decides to send Namrata along to help.  The way Raj sabotages his chances with these women is brilliant and downright hiliarious!  Obviously, we understand what is coming next: he begins to develop feelings for Namrata, even though she isn't aware of it for a time.This may seem like a typical storyline, but there is a twist to this story that I won't mention in this review for those who haven't seen the film yet.The song and dance numbers are wonderful in this movie.  As explained by a popular Bollywood actor, ""A movie without music and dance is like a movie without special effects for westerners.""This movie is just pure, genuine fun.  It does, indeed, carry a powerful message about the perception of women, and hopefully, this might serve to influence the Asian belief system about women in many of their societies.  What does it mean to be a husband?  What does it mean to be a wife?  Are they simply titles or should they mean something?Every now and then, I find myself watching the old classic films.  The stories and performances had a wonderful charm that I find is sadly lacking in most of today's films.  I'm happier now that I can start setting my sights on Bollywood films for the same thing.If these are the kinds of movies you love and enjoy, then you simply can't go wrong with Kuch Naa Kaho.  You'll find it to be one of the most wonderful three hours you've spent watching a film in a long time.
