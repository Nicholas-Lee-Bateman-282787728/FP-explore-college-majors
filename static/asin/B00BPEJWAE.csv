1636976,A3U6DD6COMYEKJ,B00BPEJWAE,Bradley Corbett,"[1, 2]","I was so looking forward to this movie when it was released in theaters and was very disappointed when it did not come to a theater near me. It finally came out to buy (but not rent) so I took a risk and bought it on Amazon. This is not something I normally do but because of the strength of the previous Simon Pegg, Nick Frost movies I figured it would be a good purchase. I was not disappointed.This movie like the previous Hot Fuzz has more depth to the comedy than what appears on the surface. American movie makers could learn something from these movies, Comedies do not need to be vapid stories full of silly gags and pushing romance at every turn. Comedies can sometimes be funny and have strong themes, it is a crazy concept, I know. You have the main character stuck in the past of the good old days and rounds up his old school friends who have all transitioned into a normal life.There is something so annoying about Gary King but he has this charisma where I felt compelled to follow him just like his old school chums. He lies, cheats and has a very selective memory and yet somehow his friends still fall in line. Nick Frost did an excellent job as the estranged friend who provides a voice of reason and rage to the movie. The characters are so much fun as they get inebriated through the night and then things get weird. Robots Things who don&#8217;t like to be called Robots have taken over the town which is one of the strong themes of the movie. As we progress as a society with our reliance on technology we start to homogenize as a society and lose some sense of personal independence. We become slaves to society, more and more like robots. You have Gary King who represents the exact opposite of that, even though his life sucks he still feels unique and his own person.The movie comes to an interesting end. It&#8217;s not quite the turn of event of Hot Fuzz but it is quite unique and matches the tone of the underlying theme. The ending is probably the weakest part of the movie but I felt it did work.I loved this movie. Warning though, there is _a lot_ of language in this movie. Some science fiction violence but the language might be a concern to some people. If you liked the previous movies, you&#8217;ll like this one. In the end I do not regret my purchase and fully plan on watching this again.Verdict: Recommended",4,Green Embers' Recommended,1384473600,"11 15, 2013",2013,2350,"['was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'when', 'did', 'not', 'come', 'theater', 'finally', 'came', 'out', 'buy', 'not', 'rent', 'took', 'risk', 'bought', 'Amazon', 'not', 'something', 'normally', 'do', 'strength', 'previous', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'movies', 'figured', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'purchase', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.This', 'movie', 'previous', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'more', 'depth', 'comedy', 'what', 'surface', 'American', 'movie', 'makers', 'could', 'learn', 'something', 'movies', 'Comedies', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'vapid', 'stories', 'full', 'silly', 'gags', 'pushing', 'romance', 'turn', 'Comedies', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'funny', 'have', 'strong', 'themes', 'crazy', 'concept', 'know', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'stuck', 'past', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'up', 'old', 'school', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'transitioned', 'normal', 'life.There', 'something', 'so', 'annoying', 'Gary', 'King', 'charisma', 'where', 'felt', 'compelled', 'follow', 'just', 'old', 'school', 'chums', 'cheats', 'very', 'selective', 'memory', 'yet', 'somehow', 'friends', 'still', 'fall', 'line', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'estranged', 'friend', 'who', 'voice', 'reason', 'rage', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'get', 'inebriated', 'night', 'then', 'things', 'get', 'weird', 'Robots', 'Things', 'who', 'don', '8217', 't', 'be', 'called', 'Robots', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'town', 'one', 'strong', 'themes', 'movie', 'progress', 'society', 'reliance', 'technology', 'start', 'homogenize', 'society', 'lose', 'sense', 'personal', 'independence', 'become', 'slaves', 'society', 'more', 'more', 'robots', 'have', 'Gary', 'King', 'who', 'exact', 'opposite', 'even', 'life', 'still', 'unique', 'own', 'person.The', 'movie', 'interesting', 'end', '8217', 'not', 'quite', 'turn', 'event', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'quite', 'unique', 'tone', 'underlying', 'theme', 'ending', 'probably', 'weakest', 'part', 'movie', 'felt', 'did', 'work.I', 'loved', 'movie', 'Warning', '_a', 'lot_', 'language', 'movie', 'science', 'fiction', 'violence', 'language', 'might', 'be', 'concern', 'people', 'liked', 'previous', 'movies', '8217', 'one', 'end', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'purchase', 'fully', 'plan', 'watching', 'again.Verdict', 'Recommended']",N/A

Not David Brent in the BBC version of &#34;The Office&#34; painful, either.  Simon Pegg's character, Gary King (or &#34;Gary the King&#34;) is an obnoxious, unlikeable boor; a manchild stuck 25 years in the past, who has never outgrown who he used to be.  His attempts to round up his estranged mates by any means possible, for a final attempt to finish a legendary pub crawl, are awkward and unfunny.  About 30 minutes into this movie, my wife and I were looking at each other wondering just what kind of movie this was and why we were watching it.Then, &#34;From Dusk Till Dawn&#34;-like, the movie completely flips tone and content and goes a totally different direction than you would expect.

1636997,A1RD1LL5E5JZOT,B00BPEJWAE,"Crookedmouth "":-/""","[2, 4]","Gary King (Pegg) took his chums on an epic pub crawl when they left school back in 1990. Now, 23 years on, his mates have got jobs, got married, got kids, got responsible. Gary, though? He never grew up. And now he wants to take them all back to Newtown Haven and do the pub crawl all over again. But something's different...The World's End is episode 3 in the Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg/Nick Frost ""Cornetto Trilogy"" that started back in 2004 withShaun of the Deadand moved on toHot Fuzzin 2007. Hotly anticipated, eagerly awaited by Pegg/Frost/Wright fans, The World's End is laugh out loud stuff, sort ofThe MatrixmeetsInvasion Of The Body Snatchers, set in Welwyn Garden City and with aNow That's What I Call Musicsoundtrack.The central theme is ""you can't go back"". You can't go back to the home town you left years ago, you can't pick up relationships that died when you were a teenager and, as becomes gradually and painfully apparent to anyone older than, say, 35, you will NEVER be 18 again. Everything changes and rarely for the better. So there is a deliciously poignant, bittersweet undercurrent for anyone who's ever looked at an old photo of themselves and then looked in the mirror and wondered where the f  k the last 20-odd years went. This is driven home by some shocking close-ups of Pegg which show that he's no longer quite as fresh-faced and cherubic as he was in Spaced...It's not all doom and gloom - TWE is a joyful, rip-roaring sci-fi comedy adventure. As with Shaun and Fuzz, TWE is not a parody of its chosen genre, it is very much OF it, but with laughs. All the traditional Wright/Pegg/Frost humour is here, laughs aplenty, slapstick, subtle mugs, and visual & observational jokes. The pop-references that define Shaun of the Fuzz are still here albeit a bit less ""obvious"". And of course the team are fastidious about keeping the running gags going (the fence-jump gag drew some of the loudest laughs in the cinema). So there IS a bit of a contradiction here - TWE is /telling/ us that ""you can't go back"", but that is, precisely what they're trying to do by keeping the Shaun of the Fuzz traditions alive and well.The fights (done in the Neo vs Agent Smith style) are what gives the movie its pace and they're choreographed to perfection, if somewhat over-relied upon. True to the Cornetto form, with plenty of gore to go around (although not your conventional red stuff).However, plot-pacing does seem to be a have been a problem. The movie grinds to a jarring and abrupt halt about 30m from the end so that the robot invasion can be explained to the audience in a long and intrusively talky expositional scene by a alien (Bill Nighy) of superior intelligence and technology, but who seems to be stuck with the Windows Phone 8 operating system. This includes a toe-curlingly cringeworthy bit where Gary and Andy (Frost) ""speak up for humanity"" and I started peeking at my watch. The movie does try to recover (and almost succeeds) with a breathless Bond-esque ""blow it all up"" finale, but then stalls again in the ""what happened to everyone afterwards"" exposit. Cue credits.As for the acting? There's a wonderfully familiar cast with all of the well-established Cornetto veterans strutting their stuff, front, centre and rear. Unsurprisingly, the two leading men dominate the movie; Nick Frost turns out a surprisingly decent dramatic performance to prove that he's got potential way beyond his familiar ""funny fat bloke"" persona. The supporting cast do fade into the background to a greater or lesser degree; Martin Freeman is good value but Paddy Considine does little more than make up the numbers. It's great to see Eddie Marsan although, like Considine, his considerable talents are rather wasted in this supporting role.The World's End is a great film, funny and exciting and, if it suffers badly from a sudden change of gear (almost into reverse?) at the end. It's definitely the weakest of the trilogy but it easily makes up for that abominationPauland demonstrates that the guys haven't lost it. Very much for an audience of a ""certain age"" although there was a younger (late-teen) contingent in the cinema who also appeared to enjoy it. TWE also has great ""re-watch"" potential and much enjoyment is to be gained from trying to spot the various references and also to savour and unpick the complex fight scenes.Recommended",4,You've got blue on you,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,4361,"['Gary', 'King', 'Pegg', 'took', 'chums', 'epic', 'pub', 'crawl', 'when', 'left', 'school', 'back', '1990', 'Now', '23', 'years', 'mates', 'have', 'got', 'jobs', 'got', 'married', 'got', 'kids', 'got', 'responsible', 'Gary', 'though', 'never', 'grew', 'up', 'now', 'take', 'back', 'Newtown', 'Haven', 'do', 'pub', 'crawl', 'over', 'again', 'something', 'different', 'World', 'End', 'episode', '3', 'Edgar', 'Wright/Simon', 'Pegg/Nick', 'Frost', 'Cornetto', 'Trilogy', 'started', 'back', '2004', 'withShaun', 'Deadand', 'moved', 'toHot', 'Fuzzin', '2007', 'Hotly', 'anticipated', 'eagerly', 'awaited', 'Pegg/Frost/Wright', 'fans', 'World', 'End', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'stuff', 'sort', 'ofThe', 'MatrixmeetsInvasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'set', 'Welwyn', 'Garden', 'City', 'aNow', 'What', 'Call', 'Musicsoundtrack.The', 'central', 'theme', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'home', 'town', 'left', 'years', 'ago', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'relationships', 'died', 'when', 'were', 'teenager', 'becomes', 'gradually', 'painfully', 'apparent', 'anyone', 'older', 'say', '35', 'will', 'NEVER', 'be', '18', 'again', 'Everything', 'changes', 'rarely', 'better', 'deliciously', 'poignant', 'bittersweet', 'undercurrent', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'looked', 'old', 'photo', 'then', 'looked', 'mirror', 'wondered', 'where', 'f', 'last', '20-odd', 'years', 'went', 'driven', 'home', 'shocking', 'close-ups', 'Pegg', 'show', 'no', 'longer', 'quite', 'fresh-faced', 'cherubic', 'was', 'Spaced', 'not', 'doom', 'gloom', 'TWE', 'joyful', 'rip-roaring', 'sci-fi', 'comedy', 'adventure', 'Shaun', 'Fuzz', 'TWE', 'not', 'parody', 'chosen', 'genre', 'very', 'much', 'laughs', 'traditional', 'Wright/Pegg/Frost', 'humour', 'here', 'aplenty', 'slapstick', 'subtle', 'mugs', 'visual', 'observational', 'jokes', 'pop-references', 'define', 'Shaun', 'Fuzz', 'are', 'still', 'here', 'bit', 'less', 'obvious', 'course', 'team', 'are', 'fastidious', 'keeping', 'running', 'gags', 'going', 'fence-jump', 'gag', 'drew', 'loudest', 'laughs', 'cinema', 'bit', 'contradiction', 'here', 'TWE', '/telling/', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'precisely', 'what', ""'re"", 'trying', 'do', 'keeping', 'Shaun', 'Fuzz', 'traditions', 'alive', 'well.The', 'fights', 'done', 'Neo', 'vs', 'Agent', 'Smith', 'style', 'are', 'movie', 'pace', ""'re"", 'choreographed', 'perfection', 'somewhat', 'over-relied', 'upon', 'True', 'Cornetto', 'form', 'plenty', 'gore', 'go', 'around', 'not', 'conventional', 'red', 'stuff', '.However', 'plot-pacing', 'seem', 'be', 'have', 'been', 'problem', 'movie', 'jarring', 'abrupt', 'halt', '30m', 'end', 'so', 'robot', 'invasion', 'can', 'be', 'explained', 'audience', 'long', 'intrusively', 'talky', 'expositional', 'scene', 'alien', 'Bill', 'Nighy', 'superior', 'intelligence', 'technology', 'who', 'be', 'stuck', 'Windows', 'Phone', '8', 'operating', 'system', 'toe-curlingly', 'cringeworthy', 'bit', 'where', 'Gary', 'Andy', 'Frost', 'speak', 'up', 'humanity', 'started', 'peeking', 'watch', 'movie', 'try', 'recover', 'almost', 'breathless', 'Bond-esque', 'blow', 'up', 'finale', 'then', 'again', 'what', 'happened', 'everyone', 'afterwards', 'exposit', 'Cue', 'credits.As', 'acting', 'wonderfully', 'familiar', 'cast', 'well-established', 'Cornetto', 'veterans', 'strutting', 'stuff', 'front', 'centre', 'rear', 'Unsurprisingly', 'two', 'leading', 'men', 'dominate', 'movie', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'out', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'prove', 'got', 'potential', 'way', 'familiar', 'funny', 'fat', 'bloke', 'persona', 'supporting', 'cast', 'do', 'fade', 'background', 'greater', 'lesser', 'degree', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'good', 'value', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'little', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'numbers', 'great', 'see', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'Considine', 'considerable', 'talents', 'are', 'rather', 'wasted', 'supporting', 'role.The', 'World', 'End', 'great', 'film', 'funny', 'exciting', 'badly', 'sudden', 'change', 'gear', 'almost', 'reverse', 'end', 'definitely', 'weakest', 'trilogy', 'easily', 'up', 'abominationPauland', 'guys', 'have', ""n't"", 'lost', 'Very', 'much', 'audience', 'certain', 'age', 'was', 'younger', 'late-teen', 'contingent', 'cinema', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', 'enjoy', 'TWE', 'also', 'great', 're-watch', 'potential', 'much', 'enjoyment', 'be', 'gained', 'trying', 'spot', 'various', 'references', 'also', 'savour', 'unpick', 'complex', 'fight', 'scenes.Recommended']",N/A

Sawin,"[4, 7]","Director and co-writer Edgar Wright, actor and co-writer Simon Pegg, and actor Nick Frost won everyone over with their 2004 zombie comedy ""Shaun of the Dead."" In 2007, they re-teamed for the action comedy ""Hot Fuzz."" In 2013, they'll complete what has been dubbed the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy (also known as the Blood and Ice Cream trilogy) with the sci-fi comedy ""The World's End."" Can ""The World's End"" live up to the hilarious reputation of the first two films in this glorious trilogy? While everyone will have their favorite, ""The World's End"" doesn't disappoint and is extremely satisfying for completely different reasons in comparison to its zombie and action packed brethren.As you follow Gary around as he tries to convince his friends to go drinking with him after so long, you begin to realize that he has a few issues that he's trying to cover up. While this is hinted at early on, it is uncovered little by little with every pub these five friends visit. Gary is extremely eager to do the golden mile, but is also very manipulative, a compulsive liar, and a hazard to those around him. It's quite a different turn for Simon Pegg, who usually plays the wholehearted hero. Gary King is like the anti-hero of nearly every role Simon Pegg has ever portrayed. Nick Frost also shows a bit of a different side to him as he mostly portrays a man who's trying to turn his life around and win his wife back. He's like a one man wrecking ball while him and Gary have one hell of a brawl that seems to be three films in the making.The film revolves around holding onto the past. While it's a bit depressing and immature at first as you can probably expect, it actually turns into a factor in assisting Gary and his friends in the second half of the film against the threat that's taken over Newton Haven. Eccentric British humor is what drives the first half hour or so of the film. Gary's inept behavior is usually at the center of everything, but other humorous instances usually involve blank stares, Andy drinking water instead of beer, selective memory, ""let's booboo,"" problems identifying proper pronouns, a marmalade sandwich, and wondering what Andy's accident was.Things take a different turn once Gary and the others end up in the bathroom of the fourth pub; The Cross Hands. Gary talking to a teenage boy while trying to relieve himself suddenly escalates into something else entirely. As is described by local loony old man named Basil (David Bradley), it's not necessarily an invasion. It's more of a merger and whatever these things are are ""full of blue stuff."" It seems like such an obvious homage to classic sci-fi, but at the same time seems like such a breath of fresh air in the way Edgar Wright and company bring it to life.You may walk out of ""The World's End"" thinking ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Hot Fuzz"" was better than ""The World's End,"" but each film is able to span a different film genre other than comedy and ""The World's End"" absolutely does the sci-fi genre proud. Edgar Wright has managed to take a concept that's so absurd and insane that it's brilliant. A simple concept matures into something rather imaginative and extraordinary. With a ton of heart, sentimentality, and a huge emphasis on friendship, ""The World's End"" puts a spin on the imperfections all humans have and delivers a film that is near perfect because of it.",5,A Blank with pronoun trouble,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,3368,"['Director', 'co-writer', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'actor', 'co-writer', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'actor', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'won', 'everyone', '2004', 'zombie', 'comedy', 'Shaun', 'Dead', '2007', 're-teamed', 'action', 'comedy', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', '2013', ""'ll"", 'complete', 'what', 'been', 'dubbed', 'Three', 'Flavours', 'Cornetto', 'trilogy', 'also', 'known', 'Blood', 'Ice', 'Cream', 'trilogy', 'sci-fi', 'comedy', 'World', 'End', 'Can', 'World', 'End', 'live', 'up', 'hilarious', 'reputation', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'glorious', 'trilogy', 'everyone', 'will', 'have', 'favorite', 'World', 'End', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'completely', 'different', 'reasons', 'comparison', 'zombie', 'action', 'packed', 'brethren.As', 'follow', 'Gary', 'around', 'convince', 'friends', 'go', 'drinking', 'so', 'long', 'begin', 'realize', 'few', 'issues', 'trying', 'cover', 'up', 'hinted', 'early', 'uncovered', 'little', 'little', 'pub', 'five', 'friends', 'visit', 'Gary', 'extremely', 'eager', 'do', 'golden', 'mile', 'also', 'very', 'manipulative', 'compulsive', 'liar', 'hazard', 'quite', 'different', 'turn', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'who', 'usually', 'wholehearted', 'hero', 'Gary', 'King', 'anti-hero', 'nearly', 'role', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'also', 'bit', 'different', 'side', 'mostly', 'man', 'who', 'trying', 'turn', 'life', 'around', 'win', 'wife', 'back', 'one', 'man', 'wrecking', 'ball', 'Gary', 'have', 'one', 'hell', 'brawl', 'be', 'three', 'films', 'making.The', 'film', 'holding', 'past', 'bit', 'depressing', 'immature', 'first', 'can', 'probably', 'expect', 'actually', 'factor', 'assisting', 'Gary', 'friends', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'threat', 'taken', 'Newton', 'Haven', 'Eccentric', 'British', 'humor', 'what', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'film', 'Gary', 'inept', 'behavior', 'usually', 'center', 'everything', 'other', 'humorous', 'instances', 'usually', 'involve', 'blank', 'stares', 'Andy', 'drinking', 'water', 'instead', 'beer', 'selective', 'memory', 'let', 'booboo', 'problems', 'identifying', 'proper', 'pronouns', 'marmalade', 'sandwich', 'wondering', 'what', 'Andy', 'accident', 'was.Things', 'take', 'different', 'turn', 'once', 'Gary', 'others', 'end', 'up', 'bathroom', 'fourth', 'pub', 'Cross', 'Hands', 'Gary', 'talking', 'teenage', 'boy', 'trying', 'relieve', 'suddenly', 'something', 'else', 'entirely', 'described', 'local', 'loony', 'old', 'man', 'named', 'Basil', 'David', 'Bradley', 'not', 'necessarily', 'invasion', 'more', 'merger', 'things', 'are', 'are', 'full', 'blue', 'stuff', 'obvious', 'homage', 'classic', 'sci-fi', 'same', 'time', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'way', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'company', 'bring', 'life.You', 'may', 'walk', 'World', 'End', 'thinking', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'was', 'better', 'World', 'End', 'film', 'able', 'span', 'different', 'film', 'genre', 'other', 'comedy', 'World', 'End', 'absolutely', 'sci-fi', 'genre', 'proud', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'managed', 'take', 'concept', 'so', 'absurd', 'insane', 'brilliant', 'simple', 'concept', 'matures', 'something', 'rather', 'imaginative', 'extraordinary', 'ton', 'heart', 'sentimentality', 'huge', 'emphasis', 'friendship', 'World', 'End', 'spin', 'imperfections', 'humans', 'have', 'delivers', 'film', 'perfect']",N/A

Twenty years later, they have the brilliant idea to do it all over again.  Or at least, Gary does.  He hasn't changed much, you see.  The other four--Andy, Peter, Oliver, and Steven--have moved on with their lives.  Grown up.  But not Gary.  And he manages to convince the guys to join him.  Except their hometown has changed.  No one seems to recognize them.  Is it that their epic night on the Golden Mile wasn't as epic as Gary believes? Or have the citizens of the town been replaced by robots filled with blue stuff?Definitely robots filled with blue stuff.Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg have created a brilliant trilogy of films.  THE WORLD'S END is a marvelous finale.  As with SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ, the real treat here is the chemistry between the cast: Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, and Eddie Marsan.  Rosamund Pike gets a nice supporting turn (she's so hit-and-miss, it hurts, because when she's good, she's great), and so does Pierce Brosnan (and yes, Bill Nighy is in there again...just wait for it).  Wright and Pegg's script doesn't necessarily raise the bar, though it at least meets the standards set by their two previous films.  Wright is making a stand as one of the more discernible directors of modern times; even his bit in GRINDHOUSE stood out from the rest of the pack.  And let's not overlook the effects; just as with SHAUN and FUZZ, WORLD'S END manages to look just as good as the films it's paying homage to.Ultimately, THE WORLD'S END comes off as a fitting cap to this trilogy.  I highly doubt this will be the end of the collaborations; after all, these guys clearly all have too much fun working together.  So let's raise a pint to the films that have been, and the films that will be.

A spiritual successor of sorts, The World's End is funny, manic and sincere in many of the same ways as Shaun of the Dead, but to far lesser degrees. It stretches for Shaun's emotional depth, but a thin, superficial set of characters can't match it. Its early action scenes are wild and entertaining, so excellent that I simply couldn't wait for the next variation, but that goodwill is quickly wasted when subsequent brawls merely rinse and repeat. Even Pegg's irreverent leading role, often relied upon to carry an iffy scene, doesn't carry the same weight he did in Hot Fuzz or SotD. In fact, in many ways he's repellent, even when a shining moment of truth seems poised to descend upon him against his will. Ultimately we're all rooting for him, but it's just by proxy and not because we genuinely want to see him triumphant. The first two acts are solid, if not excellent, but the plot's resolution rings hollow and its follow-through seems more like a dream sequence punk-out than an honest farewell.

Five old friends, led by Simon Pegg as Gary King, reunite to relive an epic youthful pub crawl, the so-called &#34;Golden Mile&#34;, which requires drinking a pint in each of twelve pubs. The previous experience left its mark, and will be relived as the five friends move from pub to pub, along with an exploration of everyone's adult problems. There is some good comedy here, and also some mature reflection.Somewhere between the second and the third pub, something starts to feel wrong. It isn't until Gary King gets into a fight in the toilet with a sullen teenager that the five, and the audience, begin to realize the old home town has changed in a rather startling way. Suddenly, the Golden Mile becomes a dramatic race for survival, with an uncertain (and unexpected) finish line.&#34;The World's End&#34; won't be every viewer's cup of tea.

1637021,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BPEJWAE,FNDNreview,"[3, 6]","In the event that you're unfamiliar with the work of Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost, they were originally stars of a British television comedy, Spaced - which was directed by Edgar Wright.  After the series ran its course over a span of two years (1999-2001), the duo took to the big screen, starring in 2004's horror comedy, Shaun of the Dead, which was written by Pegg and Wright, and also directed by Wright.  After the success and acclaim of Shaun of the Dead, the trio reteamed in 2007's action comedy, Hot Fuzz.  With another successful film under their belts, Edgar Wright went on to write and direct the comic book film, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, while Simon Pegg joined the Star Trek franchise.  In 2011, Pegg and Frost reunited by writing and starring in the sci-fi comedy, Paul.  As usual, the duo struck gold with a hefty box office pay day and above average acclaim. But, the trio still had unfinished business together, agreeing to team-up one last time to put an end to the collaboration that has become known as The Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy.  The third and final chapter to the trilogy is The World's End.Written by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright and directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz), The World's End stars Simon Pegg as Gary King, an unfulfilled alcoholic that continuously reflects on the days of his youth.  One night in their youth, Gary and his friend attempted to conquer the Golden Mile (a pub crawl consisting of 12 different pubs), in their hometown of Newton Haven - culminating at the final pub, called The World's End.  Unfortunately, Gary and his friends were unable to beat the mile in their first attempt, and since that night, everything has changed for Gary's friends - new jobs, married lives, kids, etc.  Sadly, nothing has changed for Gary and he is determined to get the boys, Oliver (Martin Freeman), Peter (Eddie Marsan), Steven (Paddy Considine), and Andy (Nick Frost), back together for one more attempt at the mile.  But, when they are finally reunited, they discover their hometown is not quite right - and neither are the inhabitants.  Pierce Brosnan, Rosamund Pike, and Bill Nighy also star in supporting roles.In the event that this is really the end of Edgar Wright's iconic Three Flavours Cornetto saga, they've certainly gone out with a bang.  Actually, bang would be a demoralizing understatement considering the sheer brilliance of the writing and acting incorporated in this final chapter - and the entire series, really.  Like the two previous films, The World's End is once again dominated by the series' illustrious leader, Simon Pegg, followed closely by his side-kick, Nick Frost.  Unlike previous films, Nick Frost takes on more of a serious role as opposed to his previous, loose-lipped portrayals.  Oddly enough, it works to Frost's benefit, messing perfectly with Pegg's character, which is ridiculously irresponsible and completely immature (not that his previous roles weren't).  Even though the roles of Pegg and Frost have changed drastically over the course of the trilogy, they've only managed to improve their stature in terms of the overall quality of entertainment.  The characters in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were significant in their own rights, but the roles of Pegg and Frost in this film are much ambitious and verbally witty.  This final installment also includes the appearances by several recognizable faces that have previously made appearances in the franchise, including Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, and Bill Nighy.Several scenes stick out over the course of The World's End, most notably of which include nearly any and every character exchange with the tyrannical Gary King (Simon Pegg).  Plus, the scenes that have the 5 gents physically facing off with the zombie-like robots - who have taken over the town.  The first fight scene, which we will simply call the bathroom battle royal, introduces the film's villains, quickly leading to a brawl within the men's restroom.  If this scene were shot on a mat surrounded by ring ropes, it would certainly resemble a wrestling match featured in the WWE.  The fights appear to be well choreographed and absurdly hilarious, providing for plenty of messy humor and ironic jokes.  While these dense robots are responsible for being the antagonist, they are relatively unthreatening.  Mainly, their only purpose is to serve as a vehicle that eventually helps heal wounds and mend rifts that have divided Pegg's character from the rest of the group.While 95 percent of the film is entertaining, the climax is a bit too extreme.  Obviously, it's hard to discuss the events in detail here without spoiling it, but needless to say, the ending doesn't really fit with the general pace of the film.  For the most part, The World's End is a theme-driven, dialogue heavy comedy (with occasional action in the later half) focusing on one man's ambition to be happy and finish something he started with his friends several years prior.  The majority of this film is fun-loving and cheeky, filled with charisma and smart, dry humor - but the ending sort of blows the whole movie out of proportion, leading to a brash, impromptu set of circumstance.  Honestly, it doesn't ruin the film by any means, but it wouldn't be a shocker to hear that Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright had a few different endings in mind for the film.Overall, The World's End is one of the smartest, well-written comedies of the year.  The acting is quite smashing (imagine that being said with a British accent), too.  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost really make a case for this film to be their best film yet.  This might be the end of a trilogy, but it's certainly not the end of the Simon Pegg/Nick Frost adventures - which have the potential to be remembered as some of the greatest comedies ever concocted.  Odds are you won't die from laughter during this film, but it does have its moments of honest humor.  One thing is for sure, with the ambitious direction of Edgar Wright and the brilliant pairing of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, you won't regret watching The World's End.  And, if you're wondering - no, you don't need to see Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz prior to watching The World's End.  The beauty of this franchise is they were all created as stand along stories for anyone and everyone to enjoy.GRADE:  BFNDNreview.com",4,"Pegg, Frost shine in 'The World's End'",1377388800,"08 25,

1637027,A16MUB2W0JJ0O4,B00BPEJWAE,Gearald Becker,"[2, 4]","Perhaps it's the fact that all the principle actors who keep reappearing in Edgar Wright's films but Simon Pegg himself (and Bill Nighy, of course) are within three years of my age that draws me so deeply into his work, but by the time news even started appearing about &lt;i>The World's End&lt;/i> I had already built up more anticipation for the final installment of the &#34;Blood And Ice Cream Trilogy&#34; (my personal favorite of the several nicknames) than anything else in a life of movie-loving. And more importantly, I was not only not disappointed, I was absolutely blown away by its marvelous ingenuity and brilliant nuances. This is definitely Wright's masterpiece. I'll go so far as to compare it to that &lt;i>other&lt;/i> Great Film that happens to be a screwball comedy about the end of the world, &lt;i>Dr. Strangelove&lt;/i>. If this movie is a sign of its director's real potential, we have some wonderful stuff to look forward to, and even if it remains the crowning achievement of his career it still marks Wright as one of the elite in his field.This is a work on an entirely different level from its predecessors, &lt;i>Shaun of the Dead&lt;/i> and &lt;i>Hot Fuzz&lt;/i>, and as much as I love those two movies, it seems almost a shame for &lt;i>The World's End&lt;/i> to be lumped in with them. It's a far deeper story with far deeper, more complex characters and an interlocking complex of themes about things that actually &lt;i>matter&lt;/i>. It's about the conflict between civilization and freedom, youth and maturity, realism and wishful thinking, friendship and codependency, and any number of other dichotomies, and manages to explore all these relationships in meaningful ways without actually answering &lt;i>any&lt;/i> of them, much less getting preachy or pushing an agenda. This is a movie that truly understands and exemplifies the only statement possible in any language that will ever be &lt;i>always&lt;/i> true: &lt;i>&#34;Nothing Is &lt;b>ever&lt;/b> that simple.&#34;&lt;/i> There are no universal answers to questions that matter, and the fact that the characters portrayed by Pegg and Nick Frost both find such true and deep happiness in the end despite their radically different choices, desires, and basic natures underlines that fact.All the way back in 2008 I posed the question in an online forum, &#34;Which are you more looking forward to: the next Marvel Avengers movie, or the next Simon Pegg/Nick Frost/Edgar Wright movie?&#34; It's both wonderfully satisfying and professionally impressive to me that next year I'll get to see both options merge when Edgar Wright's &lt;i>Ant-Man&lt;/i> adds the next Avenger to the team. I never would have foreseen that his career would reach the point where I could have both options at the same time, or for that matter that a such a gigantic media empire's blockbuster action franchise would make room for such a &#34;cultish&#34; director. I wish I were that wrong more often.My only regret about &lt;i>The World's End&lt;/i> (besides its inexplicably limited release, forcing me to find a carpool to travel almost 100 miles to see it) is the timing of the DVD release, when I just happen to be extremely short on funds. But this will be one of the &#34;one in a thousand&#34; movies that I simply can't even consider delaying adding to my collection.

Shaun of the Dead was a gore fest Zombie film, Hot Fuzz was an over the top, non-stop action romp. The World's End is a sci-fi flick that for me, seemed very reminiscent of Doctor Who. These films may just seem like they are paying homage to genre films on the surface, but all three of these films are anchored in friendship and maturing and have a believable, emotional weight to them. I thought the very epic ending to The World's End was f#@&ing; brilliant. I also enjoyed the way the Corentto Ice Cream was worked into this film, the gags that parallel Shaun and Fuzz, the whole thing is done very cleverly. Great soundtrack with tons of songs from the 1990's, great one liners like we've come to expect from Wright and Pegg's writing. Don't listen to the critics giving this a mediocre review. It's hard to say which of the three films I like best, I suppose it depends on my mood. The story and characters of The World's End resonated with me maybe even more so than Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. It's a very fitting third act to this trilogy.

1637034,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B00BPEJWAE,Graves,"[0, 0]","The third of the ""Cornetto Trilogy"" by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost it is the ultimate `you can't go home again' story.Pegg plays Gary King who has wonderful memories of the night he and his friends graduated high school and tried to do the miracle mile-a pub crawl through the 12 pubs in town. 20 years later and his 4 friends have all moved on with their lives but get a call from Gary who wants to do it all over again `for old time's sake.' Convinced, reluctantly to go to their old home town, it is best summed up when one of them, getting off the train, asked ""Which one of us is the biggest idiot for going along with this?""They then discover that Gary has NEVER grown up. He never moved on with his life. This isn't a charming Peter Pan but a case of a person who never adjusted to the world. In some cases it might be sad, pathetic even, but with Gary King clueless to the fact there's nothing wrong with his state, it's annoying to his friends and hilarious for the audience and as he revisits the triumphs of his youth, his friends are dragged along for the ride. Add on the fact that apparently all is not right in the old home town with something moving in and it becomes a night they'll never forget, if they live through it.When one suggests they run for it another points out they can't because he is clearly over the drink drive limit and so their best chance is to carry on with the crawl in the hopes the bad guys don't notice there's a problem. Naturally the baddies DO notice something is up but when you're 6 or 7 pints in, there's not much else you can do.For all that though this is less a sci fi or horror film than a film about growing up or not growing up and what can happen then. while Pegg's Gary has never grown up, his 4 friends are hitting their midlife crisis and really aren't happy either. Done in the typical style of the Cornetto trilogy it is also darned funny.For style Frost and Pegg show their serious acting chops by switching their usual roles. In Hot Fuzz, Pegg played the way too tightly wrapped professional and Frost the immature  poser. Here, they seamlessly change it off with Frost as the over achiever and Pegg as the one who can't or won't grow up.Great for the run through its ending is a little weak but as one reviewer said ""what do you expect after 12 pints of beer?"" I loved this but thought ""Hot Fuzz' was better, my wife preferred this but it's a question of which great comedy we liked better.",5,Pegg and Frost ring up another round in the Cornetto trilogy,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,2451,"['third', 'Cornetto', 'Trilogy', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'ultimate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'home', 'again', 'story.Pegg', 'plays', 'Gary', 'King', 'who', 'wonderful', 'memories', 'night', 'friends', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'tried', 'do', 'miracle', 'mile-a', 'pub', 'crawl', '12', 'pubs', 'town', '20', 'years', 'later', '4', 'friends', 'have', 'moved', 'lives', 'get', 'call', 'Gary', 'who', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'old', 'time', 'sake', 'Convinced', 'reluctantly', 'go', 'old', 'home', 'town', 'best', 'summed', 'up', 'when', 'one', 'getting', 'off', 'train', 'asked', 'Which', 'one', 'biggest', 'idiot', 'going', 'along', 'then', 'discover', 'Gary', 'NEVER', 'grown', 'up', 'never', 'moved', 'life', ""n't"", 'charming', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'case', 'person', 'who', 'never', 'adjusted', 'world', 'cases', 'might', 'be', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'even', 'Gary', 'King', 'clueless', 'fact', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'state', 'annoying', 'friends', 'hilarious', 'audience', 'triumphs', 'youth', 'friends', 'are', 'dragged', 'ride', 'Add', 'fact', 'apparently', 'not', 'right', 'old', 'home', 'town', 'something', 'moving', 'night', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forget', 'live', 'it.When', 'one', 'run', 'points', 'out', 'ca', ""n't"", 'clearly', 'drink', 'drive', 'limit', 'so', 'best', 'chance', 'carry', 'crawl', 'hopes', 'bad', 'guys', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'problem', 'Naturally', 'baddies', 'DO', 'notice', 'something', 'up', 'when', ""'re"", '6', '7', 'pints', 'not', 'much', 'can', 'do.For', 'less', 'sci', 'fi', 'horror', 'film', 'film', 'growing', 'up', 'not', 'growing', 'up', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'then', 'Pegg', 'Gary', 'never', 'grown', 'up', '4', 'friends', 'are', 'hitting', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'happy', 'either', 'Done', 'typical', 'style', 'Cornetto', 'trilogy', 'also', 'darned', 'funny.For', 'style', 'Frost', 'Pegg', 'show', 'serious', 'acting', 'chops', 'switching', 'usual', 'roles', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'Pegg', 'played', 'way', 'too', 'tightly', 'wrapped', 'professional', 'Frost', 'immature', 'poser', 'Here', 'seamlessly', 'change', 'off', 'Frost', 'achiever', 'Pegg', 'one', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up.Great', 'run', 'ending', 'little', 'weak', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'what', 'do', 'expect', '12', 'pints', 'beer', 'loved', 'thought', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'was', 'better', 'wife', 'preferred', 'question', 'great', 'comedy', 'liked', 'better']",N/A

1637038,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00BPEJWAE,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Simon Pegg calls Gary King his favorite character to have played in flicks, never mind that Gary King is obnoxious and oblivious and obviously such a self-destructive git. Gary is the overwhelming reason I at first couldn't get as into THE WORLD'S END, a film I'd been anticipating for years but then felt let down by. But then I saw it again and it's when I came around. The beauty of Pegg and Wright's movies are that they get even better with repeated viewings. Second spin around, you notice a sly reference that slipped past you the first time or a new bit of gag or, as in my case, a new perspective on Gary King. The first time, I was so annoyed by how annoying he was that it totally skipped me that that was the point of the movie. Gary defines a huge swath of the ""human"" spectrum. He's not perfect. He's human and deeply flawed, one moment so unsympathetic, the next pathetically vulnerable. And then I related to him. Anyway, THE WORLD'S END may be my least favorite of the bunch but it's an appropriate enough capstone to the Blood & Ice Cream trilogy. Or The Three Flavours of Cornetto trilogy, whichever fits ya.To paraphrase Rosamund Pike in the bonus features, ""There's always that one bloke in the group who never grew up. And if you can't figure out who that is in your group, then odds are it's you."" For Gary King, it was never so good as when he was lording it in his high school years back in good ol' Newton Haven. I guess some blokes peak way too soon. Gary's best night happened twenty years ago - June 22, 1990, it was - when he and his four best mates celebrated the final day of school by attempting that same evening to conquer the Golden Mile, a stretch of twelve pubs of which terminus is The World's End. Alas, the lads never quite made it, and the sun hasn't shined on Gary's head since.From early moments on, we're onto Gary King; we know what he's about. Twenty years later, one useless life lived later, he aims to recreate that epic pub crawl. Ah, but can he convince his old mates to go along with his mad bid at reclaiming youth?Well, yes, he does convince his old mates and so here they are, the five of the lot, motoring back to their sleepy hometown, Newton Haven. And maybe that's one of the themes of this movie - that one should never really go home again, that home, in fact, is a terrifying place. ""We're just five friends, on a night out, having a good time,"" remarks Gary King to his four cronies, and who are they tryin' to kid? Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright, co-writers of this thing, strive to drive that message home with a generous dab of awkward reunions, blue-inked robots, and a rather polite alien invasion.Plonk Pegg, Wright, and Nick Frost together in the same room, and genre cinema should just bend over for another bout of damn clever skewering. THE WORLD'S END sets you up for a wild blend of peril and British whimsy. It treats you to Wright's signature quick-cut edits, a panoply of daft blue-collar witticisms, and to folks clumsily hurdling fences. But, as with SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ, it's the unexpected bits of introspection and heartfelt emotional arcs that will resonate. It's a fabulous cast comprised of, naturally, Pegg and Nick Frost (playing the straight man, for a change), but also of Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan, Rosamund Pike, and Pierce Brosnan. Watch them as they rage against conformity and the steady job and the pursuit of betterment, as they wear immaturity like a badge of honor and flaunt it as if it were humanity's last saving grace. And, also, watch them kick massive robot butt! It's Pegg & Wright's subversive take on the sci-fi genre.And, no worries, there is a Cornetto reference.

Ross ""biblemonkey""","[0, 0]","&#8221;The World&#8217;s End&#8221; is the final film in the so called &#8220;Cornetto Trilogy,&#8221; which began with the brilliantly funny zombie spoof &#8220;Shaun Of The Dead,&#8221; hit a small bump with the amusing yet unbalanced action comedy &#8220;Hot Fuzz,&#8221; and now culminates symbolically with a laugh-filled look at the apocalypse.Gary King (Simon Pegg) is a peaked-in-highschool loser. He is a drug addict and an alcoholic, he can&#8217;t hold a steady job, and he has never moved past what he considers to be the greatest night of his life. Twenty-three years ago he and his four best friends attempted to tackle the legendary &#8220;Golden Mile,&#8221; a pub-crawl through the twelve pubs in their hometown with a pint per pub. They didn&#8217;t quite make it to the end and though Gary remembers the night fondly, he has always secretly wished they had made it to the final pub, The World&#8217;s End. He figures it&#8217;s time he and his friends finish what they started.Off Gary goes on a Blues Brothers-ish quest to &#8220;get the band back together.&#8221; One by one he rounds up his high school chums and bullies, cons, and pouts them into coming along with him one last time. Though his friends have all moved on and have successful lives and relationships of their own, they agree to one last hurrah and go back home to again attempt &#8220;The Golden Mile.&#8221;The village of Newtown Haven isn&#8217;t quite as they remember it. Most of the pubs have been &#8220;Starbucked&#8221; and made part of a larger chain with no personality of their own, and no one in town seems to remember them, even at their old hangouts. Not only that, but the townsfolk seem oddly reserved and aloof, with none of the small town &#8220;character&#8221; they remember from long ago. Is it just that the five friends have changed and grown or is something more sinister going on?That is as far I can take you without getting into spoiler territory, but one thing I can tell you, this is a worthy final chapter to the &#8220;Cornetto&#8221; films. Director Edgar Wright and screenplay co-writer Pegg have truly outdone themselves with this film. The five grown friends as played by Martin Freeman, Paddy Consindine, and Eddie Marsan are fully realized individuals with well fleshed out personalities and real chemistry together. Pegg and trilogy co-star Nick Frost play completely against type here, with Pegg playing the loathsome loser in King and Frost playing the teetotaling Andy. The rest of the cast is stellar and there is not a single lackluster performance in the entire film. The movie deals equally well with both slapstick comedy and the deeper and darker issues of addiction and mental illness. You can tell that a great deal of care and effort went into making this movie and that it was also a labor of love for all involved. There are so many &#8220;freeze frame&#8221; gags that the movie holds up well even after multiple viewings. This being said, there is one minor complaint that continues to bother many moviegoers.The ending of the film is very odd in tone and execution. It doesn&#8217;t feel connected to the rest of the film and it knocks you out of the world it has spent the rest of the movie so carefully constructing. While that may have been the intent of the filmmakers as a metaphor, it is a bit off putting and just feels out of place in this movie. Fans of the rest of the series may be willing to take this in stride, but newcomers may be hard pressed to move on to the other two films.All that aside, &#8220;The World&#8217;s End&#8221; is a clever film with plenty of fan service connecting it to the other two movies in the series and is good enough by itself to make the series some new fans. If Wright and Pegg decide to keep going and make another &#8220;Cornetto&#8221; film then I, for one, will be among the first in line.",4,A Fitting End,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,3881,"['8221', 'World', '8217', 's', 'End', '8221', 'final', 'film', 'so', 'called', '8220', 'Cornetto', 'Trilogy', '8221', 'began', 'brilliantly', 'funny', 'zombie', 'spoof', '8220', 'Shaun', 'Dead', '8221', 'hit', 'small', 'bump', 'amusing', 'yet', 'unbalanced', 'action', 'comedy', '8220', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', '8221', 'now', 'symbolically', 'laugh-filled', 'look', 'apocalypse.Gary', 'King', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'peaked-in-highschool', 'loser', 'drug', 'addict', 'alcoholic', 'can', '8217', 'hold', 'steady', 'job', 'never', 'moved', 'past', 'what', 'be', 'greatest', 'night', 'life', 'Twenty-three', 'years', 'four', 'best', 'friends', 'attempted', 'tackle', 'legendary', '8220', 'Golden', 'Mile', '8221', 'pub-crawl', 'twelve', 'pubs', 'hometown', 'pint', 'pub', 'didn', '8217', 'quite', 'make', 'end', 'Gary', 'night', 'fondly', 'always', 'secretly', 'wished', 'had', 'made', 'final', 'pub', 'World', '8217', 's', 'End', '8217', 's', 'time', 'friends', 'finish', 'what', 'started.Off', 'Gary', 'Blues', 'Brothers-ish', 'quest', '8220', 'get', 'band', 'back', 'together.', '8221', 'One', 'one', 'up', 'high', 'school', 'chums', 'bullies', 'cons', 'pouts', 'coming', 'along', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'friends', 'have', 'moved', 'have', 'successful', 'lives', 'relationships', 'own', 'agree', 'one', 'last', 'hurrah', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'again', 'attempt', '8220', 'Golden', 'Mile.', '8221', 'village', 'Newtown', 'Haven', 'isn', '8217', 'quite', 'remember', 'Most', 'pubs', 'have', 'been', '8220', 'Starbucked', '8221', 'made', 'part', 'larger', 'chain', 'personality', 'own', 'one', 'town', 'remember', 'even', 'old', 'hangouts', 'Not', 'only', 'townsfolk', 'seem', 'oddly', 'reserved', 'aloof', 'none', 'small', 'town', '8220', 'character', '8221', 'remember', 'long', 'ago', 'just', 'five', 'friends', 'have', 'changed', 'grown', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'going', 'far', 'can', 'take', 'getting', 'spoiler', 'territory', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'tell', 'worthy', 'final', 'chapter', '8220', 'Cornetto', '8221', 'films', 'Director', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'screenplay', 'co-writer', 'Pegg', 'have', 'truly', 'outdone', 'film', 'five', 'grown', 'friends', 'played', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Paddy', 'Consindine', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'are', 'fully', 'realized', 'individuals', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'personalities', 'real', 'chemistry', 'together', 'Pegg', 'trilogy', 'co-star', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'play', 'completely', 'type', 'here', 'Pegg', 'playing', 'loathsome', 'loser', 'King', 'Frost', 'playing', 'teetotaling', 'Andy', 'rest', 'cast', 'stellar', 'not', 'single', 'lackluster', 'performance', 'entire', 'film', 'movie', 'deals', 'equally', 'well', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'deeper', 'darker', 'issues', 'addiction', 'mental', 'illness', 'can', 'tell', 'great', 'deal', 'care', 'effort', 'went', 'making', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'labor', 'love', 'involved', 'are', 'so', 'many', '8220', 'freeze', 'frame', '8221', 'gags', 'movie', 'up', 'well', 'even', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'being', 'said', 'one', 'minor', 'complaint', 'bother', 'many', 'moviegoers.The', 'ending', 'film', 'very', 'odd', 'tone', 'execution', '8217', 'feel', 'connected', 'rest', 'film', 'world', 'spent', 'rest', 'movie', 'so', 'carefully', 'constructing', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'intent', 'filmmakers', 'metaphor', 'bit', 'putting', 'just', 'feels', 'place', 'movie', 'Fans', 'rest', 'series', 'may', 'be', 'willing', 'take', 'stride', 'newcomers', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'move', 'other', 'two', 'films.All', 'aside', '8220', 'World', '8217', 's', 'End', '8221', 'clever', 'film', 'plenty', 'fan', 'service', 'connecting', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'series', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'series', 'new', 'fans', 'Wright', 'Pegg', 'decide', 'keep', 'going', 'make', '8220', 'Cornetto', '8221', 'film', 'then', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'line']",N/A

1637053,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B00BPEJWAE,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[1, 2]","Director Edgar Wright has had, arguably, over the last 10 years, one of the best track records in Hollywood. Coming from his BBC comedy SPACED (in which he also worked with this film's two leads), he brought us SHAUN OF THE DEAD, a slice of fried gold satire/love letter to zombie films, then onto the wonderful HOT FUZZ, another satire/love letter to the buddy-cop genre, then what I consider to be his best film yet, the fiim adaptation of Bryan Lee O'Malley's indie comic SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD, and now, he brings us THE WORLD'S END, part reunion comedy/part alien invasion disaster film, and with this, he brings his ""Cornetto"" or ""Blood and Ice Cream"" trilogy (included with SHAUN and FUZZ) to a wonderfully entertaining, supremely hilarious and, at times, incredibly moving end.The basic gist of the film is this: Five high-school friends have come back together in their small hometown in England to complete a 12-bar ""pub crawl"" that they attempted after their graduation, but didn't complete. Led by Gary King (Simon Pegg), a man wounded at spending his days trying to relive his youth, he assembles his four old friends Oliver (Martin Freeman), Steven (Paddy Considine), Peter (Eddie Marsan) and Andy (Nick Frost), all of whom have gone on to lead successful adult lives without Gary, to complete this pub crawl with the final bar being ""The World's End"". As they go from pub to pub, Gary and Steve meet an old flame, Oliver's sister Sam (Rosamund Pike), and they notice strange goings-on around the town. Secrets about the friends lives are revealed and secrets about the town are revealed, and by the time they reach The World's End, it could very well be just that.First, the performances. They are all very top-notch, although, as with all of the other films of this trilogy, it features two stand-outs: Pegg and Frost. In SHAUN and FUZZ, though, it was Pegg as the somewhat-upstanding fellow and Frost as the irresponsible man-child. Here, in END, it's the reverse as Gary who is an alcoholic and addict, and Andy as his former best friend who has had enough of Gary's childish antics, and they do what I consider to be the best work of their respective careers. Second, the comedy. As written by Wright and Pegg, it's a tad more restrained than the more broad comedy of SHAUN and FUZZ, but it may resonate even more because there are a few scenes of unusually powerful and heartfelt drama here. Third, the direction. Wright proves that he doesn't know how to go into a slump as the film features some wonderful, eye-popping visuals and some fight scenes that are on par with the excitement of other summer films that have ten times the budget. One fight scene in particular evokes a Jackie Chan style where Gary does everything he can to chug his pint while being beset on all sides by various assailants. It's an astonishing sequence that hearkens back to the choreography that Wright showcased so brilliantly in SCOTT PILGRIM. The ending of the film might cause some casual filmgoers to feel a bit lost, but that's not a loss for the film and for fans of Wright's work.I know that the ""INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS meets THE BIG CHILL"" idea may not be the biggest draw for many people, THE WORLD'S END may very well end up being the most well-rounded and well-made film of this year's summer season, and certainly one of the most entertaining and lasting films of the year. I'm sad that it couldn't find a big American audience, but Wright's films, despite how great they are, seldom do. But they're usually discovered later on home video, and then most will find out what they missed out on on the big screen.And I can still only hope that Wright, Pegg and Frost can find any excuse to team up again.",5,"The ""Blood and Ice Cream"" Trilogy comes to a bittersweet WORLD'S END.",1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,3727,"['Director', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'had', 'arguably', 'last', '10', 'years', 'one', 'best', 'track', 'records', 'Hollywood', 'Coming', 'BBC', 'comedy', 'SPACED', 'also', 'worked', 'film', 'two', 'leads', 'brought', 'SHAUN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'slice', 'fried', 'gold', 'satire/love', 'letter', 'zombie', 'films', 'then', 'wonderful', 'HOT', 'FUZZ', 'satire/love', 'letter', 'buddy-cop', 'genre', 'then', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'yet', 'fiim', 'adaptation', 'Bryan', 'Lee', ""O'Malley"", 'indie', 'comic', 'SCOTT', 'PILGRIM', 'VS', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'now', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'END', 'part', 'reunion', 'comedy/part', 'alien', 'invasion', 'disaster', 'film', 'Cornetto', 'Blood', 'Ice', 'Cream', 'trilogy', 'included', 'SHAUN', 'FUZZ', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'supremely', 'hilarious', 'times', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'end.The', 'basic', 'gist', 'film', 'Five', 'high-school', 'friends', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'together', 'small', 'hometown', 'England', 'complete', '12-bar', 'pub', 'crawl', 'attempted', 'graduation', 'did', ""n't"", 'complete', 'Led', 'Gary', 'King', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'man', 'wounded', 'spending', 'days', 'trying', 'relive', 'youth', 'four', 'old', 'friends', 'Oliver', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Steven', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'Peter', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'Andy', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'whom', 'have', 'gone', 'lead', 'successful', 'adult', 'lives', 'Gary', 'complete', 'pub', 'crawl', 'final', 'bar', 'being', 'World', 'End', 'go', 'pub', 'pub', 'Gary', 'Steve', 'meet', 'old', 'flame', 'Oliver', 'sister', 'Sam', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'notice', 'strange', 'goings-on', 'town', 'Secrets', 'friends', 'lives', 'are', 'revealed', 'secrets', 'town', 'are', 'revealed', 'time', 'reach', 'World', 'End', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'just', 'that.First', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'top-notch', 'other', 'films', 'trilogy', 'two', 'stand-outs', 'Pegg', 'Frost', 'SHAUN', 'FUZZ', 'though', 'was', 'Pegg', 'somewhat-upstanding', 'fellow', 'Frost', 'irresponsible', 'man-child', 'Here', 'END', 'reverse', 'Gary', 'who', 'alcoholic', 'addict', 'Andy', 'former', 'best', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'Gary', 'childish', 'antics', 'do', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'best', 'work', 'respective', 'careers', 'Second', 'comedy', 'written', 'Wright', 'Pegg', 'tad', 'more', 'restrained', 'more', 'broad', 'comedy', 'SHAUN', 'FUZZ', 'may', 'resonate', 'even', 'more', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'unusually', 'powerful', 'heartfelt', 'drama', 'here', 'Third', 'direction', 'Wright', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'go', 'slump', 'film', 'wonderful', 'eye-popping', 'visuals', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'par', 'excitement', 'other', 'summer', 'films', 'have', 'ten', 'times', 'budget', 'One', 'fight', 'scene', 'particular', 'evokes', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'style', 'where', 'Gary', 'everything', 'can', 'chug', 'pint', 'being', 'beset', 'sides', 'various', 'assailants', 'astonishing', 'sequence', 'back', 'choreography', 'Wright', 'showcased', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'SCOTT', 'PILGRIM', 'ending', 'film', 'might', 'cause', 'casual', 'filmgoers', 'feel', 'bit', 'lost', 'not', 'loss', 'film', 'fans', 'Wright', 'work.I', 'know', 'INVASION', 'THE', 'BODY', 'SNATCHERS', 'THE', 'BIG', 'CHILL', 'idea', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'biggest', 'draw', 'many', 'people', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'END', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'most', 'well-rounded', 'well-made', 'film', 'year', 'summer', 'season', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'lasting', 'films', 'year', ""'m"", 'sad', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'big', 'American', 'audience', 'Wright', 'films', 'how', 'great', 'are', 'seldom', 'do', ""'re"", 'usually', 'discovered', 'later', 'home', 'video', 'then', 'most', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'missed', 'out', 'big', 'screen.And', 'can', 'still', 'only', 'hope', 'Wright', 'Pegg', 'Frost', 'can', 'find', 'excuse', 'team', 'up', 'again']",N/A

When five friends get back together after twenty years apart, they return to their hometown of Newton Haven to do The Golden Mile; 12 pubs, 60 pints. But when they return, they begin to realize changes, and soon discover that their home has become something else, and that the people they once knew are something else as well...Edgar Wright has truly crafted the greatest comedic trilogy on the planet with the Cornetto films. First, we got Shaun of the Dead; a romantic comedy with gory zombie violence. Then, we had a buddy cop comedy with Michael Bay-esque action sequences. Now, we have The World's End; a classical alien invasion movie, with a comedic King Arthur at the center. But, in comparison to the first two, I wouldn't say World's End is better or worse because, it is the end. The World's End, like Wright said, ""Is a thematic wrap-up."" We've followed these style of characters and the comedic rolls through the years, and we get to see them off in a blaze of glory (literally). Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, though, were easily at their best, with Frost sometimes stealing the show in this installment. The soundtrack was fun, really helping fill the screen with intensity and energy. Surprisingly, the action sequences are among the best I've seen for any movie, with stunts coordinated by Brad Allen from Jackie Chan's martial arts team. Even the visual effects were top-notch, especially when we get to see the robots as robots.In the end, The World's End really is the perfect send-off for fans and watchers of the Cornetto trilogy. And for those just jumping into The World's End, I suggest watching the first two beforehand because, that way, you can appreciate this one more (if you like Wright's style of dry, witty humor). Honestly, I've never felt better after leaving a movie at the theater; The World's End really shows the importance of friendship, and why we love movies in the first place.5/5 Stars*****",5,A Perfect and Heartfelt Conclusion to the Cornetto Trilogy,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",2013,1990,"['World', 'End', 'easily', 'best', 'comedy', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'When', 'five', 'friends', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'twenty', 'years', 'apart', 'return', 'hometown', 'Newton', 'Haven', 'do', 'Golden', 'Mile', '12', 'pubs', '60', 'pints', 'when', 'return', 'begin', 'realize', 'changes', 'soon', 'discover', 'home', 'become', 'something', 'else', 'people', 'once', 'knew', 'are', 'something', 'else', 'as', 'well', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'truly', 'crafted', 'greatest', 'comedic', 'trilogy', 'planet', 'Cornetto', 'films', 'First', 'got', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'gory', 'zombie', 'violence', 'Then', 'had', 'buddy', 'cop', 'comedy', 'Michael', 'Bay-esque', 'action', 'sequences', 'Now', 'have', 'World', 'End', 'classical', 'alien', 'invasion', 'movie', 'comedic', 'King', 'Arthur', 'center', 'comparison', 'first', 'two', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'World', 'End', 'better', 'worse', 'end', 'World', 'End', 'Wright', 'said', 'thematic', 'wrap-up', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'style', 'characters', 'comedic', 'rolls', 'years', 'get', 'see', 'off', 'blaze', 'glory', 'literally', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'though', 'were', 'easily', 'best', 'Frost', 'sometimes', 'stealing', 'show', 'installment', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'fun', 'really', 'helping', 'fill', 'screen', 'intensity', 'energy', 'Surprisingly', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'stunts', 'coordinated', 'Brad', 'Allen', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'martial', 'arts', 'team', 'Even', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'top-notch', 'especially', 'when', 'get', 'see', 'robots', 'robots.In', 'end', 'World', 'End', 'really', 'perfect', 'send-off', 'fans', 'watchers', 'Cornetto', 'trilogy', 'just', 'jumping', 'World', 'End', 'suggest', 'watching', 'first', 'two', 'beforehand', 'way', 'can', 'appreciate', 'one', 'more', 'like', 'Wright', 'style', 'dry', 'witty', 'humor', 'Honestly', ""'ve"", 'never', 'felt', 'better', 'leaving', 'movie', 'theater', 'World', 'End', 'really', 'importance', 'friendship', 'why', 'love', 'movies', 'first', 'place.5/5', 'Stars*****']",N/A

1637076,A2AVD56NK41OPE,B00BPEJWAE,Jonathan Stover,"[1, 2]","The World's End: written by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg; directed by Edgar Wright; starring Simon Pegg (Gary King), Nick Frost (Andy Knightley), Martin Freeman (Oliver Chamberlain), Paddy Considine (Steven Prince), Eddie Marsan (Peter Page), Pierce Brosnan (Guy Shephard), and Rosamund Pike (Sam Chamberlain) (2013): The third film in the Cornetto Trilogy (so named for the British ice-cream treat that appears in Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and this film) is a lot of serious fun.40-year-old alcoholic Gary King's greatest life moment was the night in June 1990 when he and his four best friends attempted the Golden Mile, a 12-pub pub crawl in their quaint English home town. Now, 23 years later, Gary wants to get the band back together so as to actually finish the crawl, which ended at pub 9. But he's a genuine toxic screw-up whose friends haven't talked to him in years. And he lives entirely in the past, still listening to the music and wearing the clothes of 1990. He's frozen in time, a Goth time traveller still decked out in dyed-black hair and a Sisters of Mercy t-shirt.But primarily through skullduggery and guilt-tripping, he gets the crawl going. And then things go bad. Science fictiony bad. And it ends up looking like the fate of the Earth will rest on Gary's drunken shoulders, and the shoulders of his friends. All this in a small town whose main claim to fame, as a giant road sign tells us, is that it's the site of England's first roundabout (in 1909!).The science fiction in The World's End holds up better here, in a comedy, than it does in pretty much all the 'serious' releases of the summer. It's a droll homage to science fiction British (Village of the Damned, Quatermass, and any number of Doctor Who episodes) and American (most pointedly the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but also The Day the Earth Stood Still, classic and remake). And the movie, while making something of a serious point about addiction and man-children, doesn't necessarily suggest any personal growth by the end of the picture. Or the hope of it.As in other projects from Pegg, Edgar Wright, and Nick Frost, The World's End teems with pop-culture riffs and references, though here they're as much to the music of 1990 as they are to science fiction and comic books.

1637079,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B00BPEJWAE,Joseph M. Reninger,"[2, 3]","The World's End is the third movie in the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy that began with Shaun of the Dead and continued with Hot Fuzz. The movies share the same director, writers, and stars but not the same narrative or characters. Thematically, they share the modern man's problem of growing up in a world that doesn't require him to mature.In this film, Gary King (Simon Pegg) gets his friends back together to re-do a home-town pub crawl that they had attempted back in school. Gary is a bit of a wreck and a bit of a &#34;lad&#34; as they say in England. He likes to have a good time (mostly drink too much) and doesn't really care about other people so much. He likes to argue and will keep arguing until he wins, usually by wearing out the patience of the other person. He's trapped in adolescence, almost as if the pub crawl was his gateway out of childishness and he never made it through. The other guys have moved on to middle-class white-collar jobs and lives.Going back to their home town, the lads discover things still look the same (all twelve pubs are still there) but things have changed. The first pub has been taken over by a larger company that owns a lot of &#34;local&#34; pubs which furnished the pubs the same inside. The pubs still have the local name and maybe the same staff but they offer pre-fab menus and national-brand lagers, not local dishes and ales from nearby breweries (living in England, I can verify this phenomena). The lads discuss the old times and how things have changed and how they've moved on. The movie is a fairly interesting character driven comedy to this point.Then the big reveal happens. If you don't want to be spoiled (which may have already happened if you've seen trailers or reviews or, indeed, already watched the film), stop reading now. The twist is that the townspeople have been replaced with robotic versions of themselves. The lads find out in one of the pub's toilets where a big fight breaks out between them and some local lads. The robots' injuries reveal their true nature. They leak blue oil when they are damaged. Almost the whole town has been taken over by a larger organization with presumably nefarious plans. Gary convinces the guys they have to complete the pub crawl so as not to draw attention to themselves, thus allowing them to escape at the end of the night. His arguing skills win the day and they try to make it through the pubs and the night without too much bloodshed or oilshed.Thematically this is a wonderful idea but the execution doesn't quite work. In the toilet fight, all of the sudden, in addition to robot locals, viewers have to buy into these middle-aged white-collar guys having amazing fighting skills. A bit too much comes out of left field at the same time. I found the rest of the film not as convincing or interesting as the beginning of the film, even though plenty of interesting things happen along the way. And it was still funny to the end, just not as strong as the other two films in the trilogy.Parental advisory: Constant drinking (along with some driving); swearing; violent fights but the robots don't have gory damage done to them (though one does walk around with the top half of his head missing, which is played for laughs rather than horror); some conversations about sex and an extended scene of the lads making out with late-teen/early-twenties girls.",3,Okay by itself but not as good as the other Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy,1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,3378,"['World', 'End', 'third', 'movie', 'Three', 'Flavours', 'Cornetto', 'Trilogy', 'began', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'continued', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'movies', 'share', 'same', 'director', 'writers', 'stars', 'not', 'same', 'narrative', 'characters', 'Thematically', 'share', 'modern', 'man', 'problem', 'growing', 'up', 'world', ""n't"", 'require', 'mature.In', 'film', 'Gary', 'King', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'friends', 'back', 'together', 're-do', 'home-town', 'pub', 'crawl', 'had', 'attempted', 'back', 'school', 'Gary', 'bit', 'wreck', 'bit', '34', '34', 'say', 'England', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'mostly', 'drink', 'too', 'much', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'other', 'people', 'so', 'much', 'argue', 'will', 'keep', 'arguing', 'usually', 'wearing', 'out', 'patience', 'other', 'person', 'trapped', 'adolescence', 'almost', 'pub', 'crawl', 'was', 'gateway', 'childishness', 'never', 'made', 'other', 'guys', 'have', 'moved', 'middle-class', 'white-collar', 'jobs', 'lives.Going', 'back', 'home', 'town', 'lads', 'discover', 'things', 'still', 'look', 'same', 'twelve', 'pubs', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'first', 'pub', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'larger', 'company', 'lot', '34', 'local', '34', 'pubs', 'furnished', 'pubs', 'same', 'inside', 'pubs', 'still', 'have', 'local', 'name', 'maybe', 'same', 'staff', 'offer', 'pre-fab', 'menus', 'national-brand', 'lagers', 'not', 'local', 'dishes', 'ales', 'nearby', 'breweries', 'living', 'England', 'can', 'verify', 'phenomena', 'lads', 'discuss', 'old', 'times', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'how', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'movie', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'character', 'driven', 'comedy', 'point.Then', 'big', 'reveal', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'spoiled', 'may', 'have', 'already', 'happened', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailers', 'reviews', 'indeed', 'already', 'watched', 'film', 'stop', 'reading', 'now', 'twist', 'townspeople', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'robotic', 'versions', 'lads', 'find', 'out', 'one', 'pub', 'toilets', 'where', 'big', 'fight', 'breaks', 'out', 'local', 'lads', 'robots', 'injuries', 'reveal', 'true', 'nature', 'leak', 'blue', 'oil', 'when', 'are', 'damaged', 'Almost', 'whole', 'town', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'larger', 'organization', 'presumably', 'nefarious', 'plans', 'Gary', 'guys', 'have', 'complete', 'pub', 'crawl', 'so', 'not', 'draw', 'attention', 'thus', 'allowing', 'escape', 'end', 'night', 'arguing', 'skills', 'win', 'day', 'try', 'make', 'pubs', 'night', 'too', 'much', 'bloodshed', 'oilshed.Thematically', 'wonderful', 'idea', 'execution', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'toilet', 'fight', 'sudden', 'addition', 'robot', 'locals', 'viewers', 'have', 'buy', 'middle-aged', 'white-collar', 'guys', 'having', 'amazing', 'fighting', 'skills', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'left', 'field', 'same', 'time', 'found', 'rest', 'film', 'not', 'convincing', 'interesting', 'beginning', 'film', 'even', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'things', 'happen', 'way', 'was', 'still', 'funny', 'end', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'trilogy.Parental', 'advisory', 'Constant', 'drinking', 'driving', 'swearing', 'violent', 'fights', 'robots', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'gory', 'damage', 'done', 'one', 'walk', 'top', 'half', 'head', 'missing', 'played', 'laughs', 'rather', 'horror', 'conversations', 'sex', 'extended', 'scene', 'lads', 'making', 'out', 'late-teen/early-twenties', 'girls']",N/A

Approximately mid-way, the tone shifts abruptly and either the viewer is either willing to go along for the ride, or they're not.  The first half of the film is more of a character study in which a group of friends are reunited to recreate a &#34;pub crawl&#34;, i.e., visiting twelve pubs in one night.  Pegg's performance during this part is good, but his character is completely unlikable... and a bit of a jerk.  Frost was equally good, perhaps better, and I would have preferred he had more dialogue during the first hour.  The foley sounds and quick editing are irritating and instead of being cinematic, feels more like I'm watching a commercial for coffee or a sports drink.The second half of the movie is a science-fiction comedy which turns tail on the first half of the film.  The action scenes are filmed rather well, the movements are clear and it is easy to distinguish exactly what is happening during a fight.

1637112,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00BPEJWAE,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[1, 2]","The irreverent comedy trio of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost are responsible for some pretty hard-hitting comedies, including the widely praisedShaun of the Dead(spoofing horror/zombie films) and the underratedHot Fuzz(spoofing action/thrillers). They're back with another earnest spoof, this one of the sci-fi genre, although you wouldn't know it if you walked out just before the halfway mark.The film, THE WORLD'S END, follows a group of five friends who, after experiencing a wild and crazy (and unfinished) pub crawl as high schoolers, ended up drifting far, far apart. Gary King, the self-appointed alpha male of the group, returns after a decade and change with the intent of reuniting the group to complete the pub crawl they never finished. Now with careers, softening middle sections, and children at home, its a sketchy proposition as they try to recapture the glory of their youth in the unlikely ""golden mile"" of their hometown's stretch of booze joints.As with all of the Wright/Frost/Pegg vehicles, the dialogue is snappy, brisk, and witty, the comedy is slick, curly, and inventive, and the story doesn't sacrifice character depth for cheap laughs (even if it doesn't hesitate to get in a cheap laugh when possible). The attempt to make things relevant and real does slow the first half down, making the sudden switch into science fiction feel half-baked. Halfway through reliving the pub crawl, our five-some begin to realize that sinister things are afoot in their hometown. (This, actually, is a running theme for the Wright/Pegg/Frost films: a small group ends up battling an entire town is pretty much the basic plot of all of their movies.) As the night begins to decay into madness, the film speeds up to an almost relentless pace that, while invigorating and fun to watch (there are a whole lot of candy-sweet action sequences to sink your teeth into), tends to blur past some pretty serious crevices in the plot.At the start, it feels a lot like the film is doing a clever, tongue-in-cheek, almost brilliant metaphor for how you can never go home again, and what it means to grow up versus holding on to childhood, but the possibility for deep moralizing or even just thoughtful parabolizing is tossed aside for some fairly flat jokes. That's not really so bad; the movie doesn't have to mean much as long as it's entertaining. However, by the time our gentlemen reach the last pub on their list -- the aptly titled The World's End -- the script has expended so much steam and adrenaline that the film feels exhausted, tying up all of its loose ends with a pretty silly lecture from both the good guys and bad, capping it all off with an equally lazy voice over to give the audience some closure. It feels like the final ten minutes of the film were made up on the spot, and not all of it makes much sense.While most of the movie is a ton of fun to watch and is truly engaging on multiple levels, the intensely human comedy of the first half ends up dissolving into the cartoonishly caricatured comedy of the second half. Both halves by themselves aren't bad at all, but the way they inexpertly mesh leaves behind more than a few plotholes, as well as the sense that the movie isn't as good as it could have been.",4,"It's The End Of The World As We Know It, And I Feel Fine",1378771200,"09 10, 2013",2013,3248,"['irreverent', 'comedy', 'trio', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'are', 'responsible', 'pretty', 'hard-hitting', 'comedies', 'including', 'widely', 'praisedShaun', 'Dead', 'spoofing', 'horror/zombie', 'films', 'underratedHot', 'Fuzz', 'spoofing', 'action/thrillers', ""'re"", 'back', 'earnest', 'spoof', 'one', 'sci-fi', 'genre', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'walked', 'out', 'just', 'halfway', 'mark.The', 'film', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'END', 'group', 'five', 'friends', 'who', 'experiencing', 'wild', 'crazy', 'unfinished', 'pub', 'crawl', 'high', 'schoolers', 'ended', 'up', 'drifting', 'far', 'far', 'apart', 'Gary', 'King', 'self-appointed', 'alpha', 'male', 'group', 'returns', 'decade', 'change', 'intent', 'reuniting', 'group', 'complete', 'pub', 'crawl', 'never', 'finished', 'Now', 'careers', 'softening', 'middle', 'sections', 'children', 'home', 'sketchy', 'proposition', 'try', 'recapture', 'glory', 'youth', 'unlikely', 'golden', 'mile', 'hometown', 'stretch', 'booze', 'joints.As', 'Wright/Frost/Pegg', 'vehicles', 'dialogue', 'snappy', 'brisk', 'witty', 'comedy', 'slick', 'curly', 'inventive', 'story', ""n't"", 'sacrifice', 'character', 'depth', 'cheap', 'laughs', 'even', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'get', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'when', 'possible', 'attempt', 'make', 'things', 'relevant', 'real', 'slow', 'first', 'half', 'down', 'making', 'sudden', 'switch', 'science', 'fiction', 'feel', 'half-baked', 'Halfway', 'reliving', 'pub', 'crawl', 'five-some', 'begin', 'realize', 'sinister', 'things', 'are', 'afoot', 'hometown', 'actually', 'running', 'theme', 'Wright/Pegg/Frost', 'films', 'small', 'group', 'up', 'battling', 'entire', 'town', 'pretty', 'much', 'basic', 'plot', 'movies', 'night', 'decay', 'madness', 'film', 'up', 'almost', 'relentless', 'pace', 'invigorating', 'fun', 'watch', 'are', 'whole', 'lot', 'candy-sweet', 'action', 'sequences', 'sink', 'teeth', 'blur', 'pretty', 'serious', 'crevices', 'plot.At', 'start', 'lot', 'film', 'doing', 'clever', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'almost', 'brilliant', 'metaphor', 'how', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'home', 'again', 'what', 'grow', 'up', 'versus', 'holding', 'childhood', 'possibility', 'deep', 'moralizing', 'even', 'just', 'thoughtful', 'parabolizing', 'tossed', 'aside', 'fairly', 'flat', 'jokes', 'not', 'really', 'so', 'bad', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'mean', 'much', 'as', 'long', 'entertaining', 'However', 'time', 'gentlemen', 'reach', 'last', 'pub', 'list', 'aptly', 'titled', 'World', 'End', 'script', 'expended', 'so', 'much', 'steam', 'adrenaline', 'film', 'feels', 'exhausted', 'tying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'pretty', 'silly', 'lecture', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'capping', 'off', 'equally', 'lazy', 'voice', 'give', 'audience', 'closure', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'film', 'were', 'made', 'up', 'spot', 'not', 'much', 'sense.While', 'most', 'movie', 'ton', 'fun', 'watch', 'truly', 'engaging', 'multiple', 'levels', 'intensely', 'human', 'comedy', 'first', 'half', 'up', 'dissolving', 'cartoonishly', 'caricatured', 'comedy', 'second', 'half', 'halves', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'way', 'inexpertly', 'mesh', 'leaves', 'more', 'few', 'plotholes', 'as', 'well', 'sense', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A

Oleson,"[25, 35]","This is a theatrical review and there may be spoilers...unless you've seen the trailers.This hilarious British comedy features the same folks who brought us ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" so get ready for a good time.  This time out, 5 old friends decide to return to their small home town best known for having the world's first roundabout and The Golden Mile.  The later features a series of 12 pubs concluding at The World's End.  Twenty years earlier the boys only made it half way before youthful drinking incapacitated them.Four of the five have moved on, but Gary King (Simon Pegg) aka ""The King"" (how original) hasn't.  He still wears the same tee-shirt over the same long trench coat that he did we he was 20.  He still drives the same car (The Beast), is still irresponsible and well, you get the picture.  He decides it would be a good idea to go back home and start over and this time complete their original goal of 1 pint of beer (minimum) at each of the 12 pubs.  The other 4, Andy (Nick Frost), Oliver (Martin Freeman), Steven (Paddy Considine), and Peter (Eddie Marsan), reluctantly give in and off they go.Along the way, we get plenty of in-the-car-bickering mostly between the alcoholic Gary and the now teetotaler Andy.  Directed and co-written (with Pegg) by Edgar Wright, we get just the right amount of obnoxiousness from Gary without wanting to strangle him.  In other words, he's funny.  Now all of these would seem a bit much after a while as the guys get progressively drunk, but things get a bit weird.  At first Gary notices that the bartenders don't recognize him.  Others seem to be the same age as they were when he left.  Rosamund Pike is introduced midway as the Oliver's sister and former love crush of Steven and Gary.  It's pretty much a thankless role.  But she being sober, notices the same aloofness of the locals.If you've seen the trailers, you know that the town has been overrun by some strangers who ooze blue blood and emit bright light from their eyes and mouth.  Androids to be sure, but the boys just call them robots.  In fact, in one of the funnier scenes, the guys sit around the table, pints in hand, and try to come up a name for the robots.  Unable to reach a consensus they just call them the ""blanks.""  Got to love it.  As the quintet continue their mission, they have to avoid the ""blanks"" who want the guys to adapt rather than fight.But the guys are more concerned about getting to The World's End.  For Gary, it is clearly his mission in life.  The final act is a doozy with some surprisingly funny and well-staged fight scenes and some hilarious byplay between Gary and a character played by Bill Nighy.",4,A jolly good time in England,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",2013,2669,"['theatrical', 'review', 'may', 'be', 'spoilers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailers.This', 'hilarious', 'British', 'comedy', 'same', 'folks', 'who', 'brought', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'so', 'get', 'ready', 'good', 'time', 'time', 'out', '5', 'old', 'friends', 'decide', 'return', 'small', 'home', 'town', 'best', 'known', 'having', 'world', 'first', 'roundabout', 'Golden', 'Mile', 'later', 'series', '12', 'pubs', 'concluding', 'World', 'End', 'Twenty', 'years', 'earlier', 'boys', 'only', 'made', 'half', 'way', 'youthful', 'drinking', 'incapacitated', 'them.Four', 'five', 'have', 'moved', 'Gary', 'King', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'King', 'how', 'original', ""n't"", 'still', 'same', 'tee-shirt', 'same', 'long', 'trench', 'coat', 'did', 'was', '20', 'still', 'same', 'car', 'Beast', 'still', 'irresponsible', 'well', 'get', 'picture', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'start', 'time', 'complete', 'original', 'goal', '1', 'pint', 'beer', 'minimum', '12', 'pubs', 'other', '4', 'Andy', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'Oliver', 'Martin', 'Freeman', 'Steven', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'Peter', 'Eddie', 'Marsan', 'reluctantly', 'give', 'go.Along', 'way', 'get', 'plenty', 'in-the-car-bickering', 'mostly', 'alcoholic', 'Gary', 'now', 'Andy', 'Directed', 'co-written', 'Pegg', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'get', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'obnoxiousness', 'Gary', 'wanting', 'strangle', 'other', 'words', 'funny', 'Now', 'would', 'seem', 'bit', 'much', 'while', 'guys', 'get', 'progressively', 'drunk', 'things', 'get', 'bit', 'weird', 'first', 'Gary', 'notices', 'bartenders', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'Others', 'seem', 'be', 'same', 'age', 'were', 'when', 'left', 'Rosamund', 'Pike', 'introduced', 'midway', 'Oliver', 'sister', 'former', 'love', 'crush', 'Steven', 'Gary', 'pretty', 'much', 'thankless', 'role', 'being', 'sober', 'same', 'aloofness', 'locals.If', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailers', 'know', 'town', 'been', 'overrun', 'strangers', 'who', 'ooze', 'blue', 'blood', 'emit', 'bright', 'light', 'eyes', 'mouth', 'Androids', 'be', 'sure', 'boys', 'just', 'call', 'robots', 'fact', 'one', 'funnier', 'scenes', 'guys', 'sit', 'table', 'pints', 'hand', 'try', 'come', 'up', 'name', 'robots', 'Unable', 'reach', 'consensus', 'just', 'call', 'blanks', 'Got', 'love', 'quintet', 'continue', 'mission', 'have', 'avoid', 'blanks', 'who', 'want', 'guys', 'adapt', 'rather', 'fight.But', 'guys', 'are', 'more', 'concerned', 'getting', 'World', 'End', 'Gary', 'clearly', 'mission', 'life', 'final', 'act', 'doozy', 'surprisingly', 'funny', 'well-staged', 'fight', 'scenes', 'hilarious', 'byplay', 'Gary', 'character', 'played', 'Bill', 'Nighy']",N/A

Instead, I stare in open-mouthed amazement).  &#34;The World's End&#34; has a high bar to clear, but it does so easily.  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost deliver excellent performances that reverse their usual dynamic, but the real takeaway from this movie is just what an outstanding director Edgar Wright has become.  The action sequences in the movie are fluidly shot and well-planned and executed.  Many a big-name &#34;action&#34; director could stand a day or two observing at Edgar Wright's feet.  Like the previous volumes in the trilogy, &#34;The World's End&#34; delivers laughs, a solid script, an homage/appreciation of genre that moves far beyond parody, and some intriguing ideas.

Their walk down memory lane is abruptly halted by an invasion of robots bent on ""replacing"" all humans on earth. Will that stop our heroes from consuming a pint from each of the 12 finest pubs in Newton Haven?Like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, the final installment in the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy (unofficially named for the ice cream brand featured in the three films) is an outrageously goofy spoof, this time taking on the science-fiction genre. As a note to those unfamiliar with the series, the films are not directly connected; each has its own self-contained story. All three were written and directed by Edgar Wright, with starring roles courtesy of Simon Pegg (who also shares writing credit) and Nick Frost.The World's End is not just a side-splitting comedy, but a good film that never delivers laughs at the expense of plot or character development. Performances from the leads are typically excellent. Pegg plays the irresponsible goofball Gary King, who can't take his mind off booze, even with a horde of robots in hot pursuit. Frost plays Gary's stern, no-nonsense friend Andy Knightley so well, the viewer will forget that the same actor played a roly-poly dimwit in both Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. A memorable supporting cast and CGI/action sequences on par with the highest-grossing superhero movies make it superior to the first film in the trilogy.As the reader can infer from the spelling of the trilogy, The World's End is a British comedy, which is an acquired taste. American viewers expecting The Hangover with robots will be disappointed. The conclusion and subsequent epilogue aren't quite as inspired as they could be, and sci-fi buffs will notice certain hackneyed plot devices. While the supporting cast is vibrant and each one gets a moment in the sun, some, like Gary's other friends, aren't as well-developed as they should be. Frost's characters in Shaun of the Dead and (especially) Hot Fuzz stole every scene they were in, but Pegg isn't quite as successful portraying the stooge as he is a straight man.The World's End is the funniest movie of the year, and a worthy conclusion to an exceptional trilogy.

Simon Pegg's character was hyper and irresponsible and his friends were initially stodgily middle age and non-whimsical (with nary a twinkle in their eye) and the pairing of the two opposites, without explaining to the audience what motivated the sides, left me outside the story. remember Shaun of the Dead, when Simon Pegg's roommates disliked each other, and the audience liked the Nick character, but the story showed why he was unappealing to the other roommate (Nick's character was an unmotivated slob), well that information made sense to the audience and let us into the story: we understood the dynamic between the 3 roommates. In this film, the dynamic between the 5 characters wasn't explained early enough in the film for us to understand why 4 seemingly uber responsible men would indulge an old school mate they'd not seen in decades. 2 and a half stars, for solid acting and great comedic timing: these actors are at the top of their game - story approach needed a rethink, is all.Final thoughts: these guys were unbelievably outstanding fighters for average middle age men. after hours guzzling beer had no problem fighting off hordes of invaders. I believe the Simon Pegg character smoked and though he had to run he never wheezed. Also, the Nick Frost character, who is large, was a fantastic fighter and ran for blocks, all without getting winded. Not believable that middle age men who dressed like accountants and had sedentary jobs, drinking lots and lots and lots of beer (only one guy had to go to the bathroom once as a consequence of all that fluid, again not believable - middle age people's bladders are not the bladders of 20 year olds), with shots too, smoked, and overweight, were fantastic fighting machines and up to the physical challenge as presented in the story.",2,worth watching for the acting but relationships not established early enough 2 help audience make sense of characters (SPOILERS),1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,2826,"['did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'lead', 'suddenly', 're-appeared', 'friends', 'demanding', 'pub', 'crawl', 'excuse', 'mom', 'having', 'died', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'even', 'story', 'revealed', 'was', 'lying', 'writers', 'showed', 'characters', 'knew', 'one', 'had', 'relationship', 'did', ""n't"", 'present', 'enough', 'information', 'initially', 'audience', 'attach', 'spastic', 'lead', 'character', 'was', 'wrangling', 'other', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'motivating', 'real', 'life', 'old', 'school', 'mate', 'appear', 'what', '20', 'years', 'drop', 'life', 'weekend', 'accomodate', 'what', 'children', 'previous', 'engagements', 'blowing', 'off', 'done', 'wrong', 'past', 'reactions', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'more', 'believable', '4', 'middle', 'age', 'guys', 'allowing', 'be', 'talked', 'pub', 'crawl', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'suck', 'actors', 'are', 'outstanding', 'writers', 'needed', 'give', 'audience', 'more', 'info', 'lead', 'could', 'buy', 'why', 'four', 'former', 'mates', 'would', 'go', 'along', 'grudgingly', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'character', 'was', 'hyper', 'irresponsible', 'friends', 'were', 'initially', 'stodgily', 'middle', 'age', 'non-whimsical', 'twinkle', 'eye', 'pairing', 'two', 'opposites', 'explaining', 'audience', 'what', 'motivated', 'sides', 'left', 'story', 'remember', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'when', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'roommates', 'disliked', 'other', 'audience', 'liked', 'Nick', 'character', 'story', 'showed', 'why', 'was', 'unappealing', 'other', 'roommate', 'Nick', 'character', 'was', 'unmotivated', 'slob', 'well', 'information', 'made', 'sense', 'audience', 'let', 'story', 'understood', 'dynamic', '3', 'roommates', 'film', 'dynamic', '5', 'characters', 'was', ""n't"", 'explained', 'early', 'enough', 'film', 'understand', 'why', '4', 'seemingly', 'uber', 'responsible', 'men', 'would', 'indulge', 'old', 'school', 'mate', ""'d"", 'not', 'seen', 'decades', '2', 'half', 'stars', 'solid', 'acting', 'great', 'comedic', 'timing', 'actors', 'are', 'top', 'game', 'story', 'approach', 'needed', 'rethink', 'all.Final', 'thoughts', 'guys', 'were', 'unbelievably', 'outstanding', 'fighters', 'average', 'middle', 'age', 'men', 'hours', 'guzzling', 'beer', 'had', 'problem', 'fighting', 'off', 'hordes', 'invaders', 'believe', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'character', 'smoked', 'had', 'run', 'never', 'wheezed', 'Also', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'character', 'who', 'large', 'was', 'fantastic', 'fighter', 'ran', 'blocks', 'getting', 'winded', 'Not', 'believable', 'middle', 'age', 'men', 'who', 'dressed', 'accountants', 'had', 'sedentary', 'jobs', 'drinking', 'lots', 'lots', 'lots', 'beer', 'only', 'one', 'guy', 'had', 'go', 'bathroom', 'once', 'consequence', 'fluid', 'again', 'not', 'believable', 'middle', 'age', 'people', 'bladders', 'are', 'not', 'bladders', '20', 'year', 'olds', 'shots', 'too', 'smoked', 'overweight', 'were', 'fantastic', 'fighting', 'machines', 'up', 'physical', 'challenge', 'presented', 'story']",N/A

1637183,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00BPEJWAE,The People's Critic,"[5, 9]","Well ladies and gentlemen, the Cornetto trilogy has finally come to a close.  Whether you knew it or not, director Edgar Wright and writer/actor/producer Simon Pegg teamed up in 2004 to create the most loosely connected cinematic trilogy of all time beginning with Shaun of the Dead, followed by Hot Fuzz in 2007, and culminating in 2013 with The World's End.  The films share no characters, plot devices, settings, or  really any foreseeable connective quality.  What they do share is actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, passing references to a popular British ice cream treat called Cornetto, and a few surprises for die-hard fans.  Otherwise, these three films are as unrelated as could be.  What we're left with is a social commentary wrapped up in an inside joke that unfortunately has no solid punch line.The World's End follows Peter, Andy, Oliver (also known as `Oman' because of an unfortunate birthmark shaped like a 6 on his forehead), and ringleader Gary.  In 1990, Gary (Simon Pegg) and his four best friends attempted and failed to complete ""The Golden Mile,"" a 12 tavern pub crawl in their hometown of Newton Haven that ends at a particular pub named The World's End.  Twenty years later, Gary's life has paled in comparison to that fabled night two decades ago, and while he has not quite left the wild days of his youth behind, his friends have.  After recounting his happier days at a rehab session, Gary decides to reconnect with his reluctant friends and convince them to give ""the Golden Mile"" one more go.The World's End does very well moving from point A to point B providing lively introductions to the characters and Hangover-style laughs as the group of friends reminisce over past antics and attempt to reclaim the passion of their youth.  Pegg's performance as Gary is uproarious and sharp.  His reaction to Andy (Nick Frost) ordering a tap water rather than a proper pint is comic perfection, and his various monologues are quick witted, fast, and smart.  Unfortunately, the film hits a stumble moving from point B to point C and does a world class face plant on its way to point D.I want to preface this next point by saying that I do not think From Dusk Til Dawn is a good film, nor do I feel that The World's End is a bad film, yet a comparison must be made.  From Dusk Til Dawn, the George Cloony/Quentin Tarantino vampire western, is notoriously critiqued in the following way: ""It was pretty good until the vampires showed up.""  The World's End will likely receive similar word of mouth, except replace ""vampires"" with ""alien robots.""  The movie does not come entirely off the rails upon the revelation of alien robots, but the tone becomes uneven and ""ludicrous"" becomes a word that might be used to describe the events from that point forward.  Proponents of the film will cite Shaun of the Dead as a film that similarly injects a sudden influx of horror into an otherwise silly comedy.  However, the mixing of genres in that film works far better than in this one.  The ""body snatching"" alien storyline interrupts all of the progress made in the film's first half and unfortunately leads to an incredibly unsatisfying conclusion.The World's End is admittedly British.  By this, I mean that the humor, styling, and overall mood of the film is dry and at times very silly.  Fans of this type of humor know what I mean, and those who go through life saying, ""I don't understand what's so funny about Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" should stay miles away from The World's End.  The film works somewhat well as a critique on the globalization of society where the boys find the pubs they once loved for their individuality becoming increasingly ""starbucked,"" resembling one another in every detail.  Additionally, Wright and Pegg have written a film that cleverly alludes to films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and John Carpenter's The Thing in quite nuanced and ingeniously fresh ways.  Quite a bit works in The World's End, but ponderous choices are made from time to time that will leave audiences scratching their heads.  Overall, The World's End is funny but also preposterous, and it fails to successfully convey a satisfactory point about being middle-aged or the loss of youth, both of which are so strongly introduced in the film's first half.  I for one would enjoy a film about these five guys rehashing the past and drinking - end of story.  There is no doubt that Wright and Pegg are a good team, and while Pegg is becoming more of a household name thanks to high profile roles like Scotty in J.J. Abrams' Star Trek films, he still has plenty of passion for his roots.  As they leave the ""Cornetto"" behind, I think strong collaborations are in store for the future.  B-The World's End is rated R and has a running time of 1 hour and 49 minutes.  Aside from Pegg and Frost, the cast also features some interesting cameos (some more obvious than others) as well as Martin Freeman (currently playing Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's Hobbit films), who successfully revives the phrase ""WTF,"" and Rosamund Pike (soon to be seen in David Fincher's Gone Girl) who successfully revives the phrase ""oh crumbs.""",3,It's not Shaun of the

1637195,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,B00BPEJWAE,V. Berk,"[60, 76]","Comedy is hard.  Delivering consistently  outstanding comedies seems near impossible these days, but with The World's End the team of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost have delivered yet another hilarious, genre bending film, this time setting their scopes on classic science-fiction.  The film features the action comedy one would expect from the team, but also succeeds in arguably possessing Simon Pegg's best performance to date.The World's End begins on a semi-realistic note.  Four friends in 1990 attempted to complete the Golden Mile: 12 pubs, 12 pints, one night.  All of them have moved on to productive careers except for the former ringleader Gary King (Simon Pegg).  After suffering a psychiatric breakdown and determined to regain his youth Gary coerces the group together to take one last shot at the Golden Mile. But coming home isn't always easy as the gang soon discovers that the townspeople are being replaced by robots.  Despite all this Gary leads the gang onward determined to reach the final pub: The World's End.Simon Pegg as Gary King is childish, pitiful, and manipulative which makes for a great role reversal with Nick Frost (who has played goofy characters in the previous films) now being the serious, take charge figure of the group.  The science-fiction plot is handled with great care and is inspired most directly by Invasion of the Body Snatchers and with some elements of apocalyptic fiction.  Particularly worth noting when discussing the robots is Pierce Brosnan, who arrives as the boy's former teacher and nails a chilling speech detailing the unknown alien entity's plans.  If you enjoy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy brand of sci-fi absurdity than you'll feel right at home.As with any Edgar Wright film the audience is also treated to several unique action scenes as the fellas tear their way through the army of robot townsfolk, spilling blue blood wherever they go.  Edgar Wright is an inventive director and is clearly right in his element, and although they don't top the shootout in Hot Fuzz you're bound to be entertained by these sequences.Of the trilogy The World's End is the most emotional the team has delivered.  We laugh, but Gary King's life is a tragedy and Simon Pegg's performance perfectly captures a man stuck in the past. There's still the absurdity, and tongue-in-cheekness of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, but The World's End has a meatier emotional center because of Simon Pegg's performance.  If you loved Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz you'll undoubtedly love The World's End.  It is a thoughtful comedy despite its absurdity and is sure to leave you with a smile on your face.",5,The Boys are Back in Town,1377561600,"08 27, 2013",2013,2661,"['Comedy', 'hard', 'Delivering', 'consistently', 'outstanding', 'comedies', 'impossible', 'days', 'World', 'End', 'team', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'have', 'delivered', 'yet', 'hilarious', 'genre', 'bending', 'film', 'time', 'setting', 'scopes', 'classic', 'science-fiction', 'film', 'action', 'comedy', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'team', 'also', 'arguably', 'possessing', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'best', 'performance', 'date.The', 'World', 'End', 'semi-realistic', 'note', 'Four', 'friends', '1990', 'attempted', 'complete', 'Golden', 'Mile', '12', 'pubs', '12', 'pints', 'one', 'night', 'have', 'moved', 'productive', 'careers', 'former', 'ringleader', 'Gary', 'King', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'suffering', 'psychiatric', 'breakdown', 'determined', 'regain', 'youth', 'Gary', 'group', 'together', 'take', 'one', 'last', 'shot', 'Golden', 'Mile', 'coming', 'home', ""n't"", 'always', 'easy', 'gang', 'soon', 'discovers', 'townspeople', 'are', 'being', 'replaced', 'robots', 'Gary', 'gang', 'onward', 'determined', 'reach', 'final', 'pub', 'World', 'End.Simon', 'Pegg', 'Gary', 'King', 'childish', 'pitiful', 'manipulative', 'great', 'role', 'reversal', 'Nick', 'Frost', 'who', 'played', 'goofy', 'characters', 'previous', 'films', 'now', 'being', 'serious', 'take', 'charge', 'figure', 'group', 'science-fiction', 'plot', 'handled', 'great', 'care', 'inspired', 'most', 'directly', 'Invasion', 'Body', 'Snatchers', 'elements', 'apocalyptic', 'fiction', 'Particularly', 'worth', 'noting', 'when', 'discussing', 'robots', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'who', 'boy', 'former', 'teacher', 'chilling', 'speech', 'detailing', 'unknown', 'alien', 'entity', 'plans', 'enjoy', 'Hitchhiker', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'brand', 'sci-fi', 'absurdity', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'right', 'home.As', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'film', 'audience', 'also', 'treated', 'several', 'unique', 'action', 'scenes', 'fellas', 'tear', 'way', 'army', 'robot', 'townsfolk', 'spilling', 'blue', 'blood', 'wherever', 'go', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'inventive', 'director', 'clearly', 'right', 'element', 'do', ""n't"", 'top', 'shootout', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', ""'re"", 'bound', 'be', 'entertained', 'trilogy', 'World', 'End', 'most', 'emotional', 'team', 'delivered', 'laugh', 'Gary', 'King', 'life', 'tragedy', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'performance', 'perfectly', 'man', 'stuck', 'past', 'still', 'absurdity', 'tongue-in-cheekness', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'World', 'End', 'meatier', 'emotional', 'center', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'performance', 'loved', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', ""'ll"", 'undoubtedly', 'love', 'World', 'End', 'thoughtful', 'comedy', 'absurdity', 'sure', 'leave', 'smile', 'face']",N/A
1637196,A4YXKE5F62II8,B00BPEJWAE,Visual Bureau,"[9, 14]","""The World's End, the last film in the Cornetto trilogy by Edgar Wright, does not disappoint with its outlandish and original premise about five men living out their disillusioned youth to go to their hometown to visit 12 pubs only to find out something they weren't ready for. Without revealing too much, the film manages to make satire among many things like British mannerisms and culture, alcoholism, relationships, partying, and ultimately...robots, aliens, and the apocalypse. Cor blimey!Simon Pegg provides an intriguingly bizarre role as Gary King, a deranged alcoholic who just wants to have a good time and keeps quoting Primal Scream's song Loaded as well as many other classic tunes from the 1990s era of British music (which complement the film excellently and humorously with acts like Happy Mondays, The Stone Roses, and The Housemartins, a band that kick-started Fatboy Slim in the music industry). Nick Frost (Pegg's usual companion in the Cornetto films) complements a more restrained role here but the stars that steal the show include Pierce Brosnan as a uptight, port-drinking teacher and Eddie Marsan playing a nervous recluse (which is a strong turn from his role as a disturbing abusive husband in Tyrannosaur).In addition, the film builds its craziness strong by offering some stylish and intriguingly kinetic action and special effects work, cartoonish hilarity, and random moments especially one involving a supercomputer voiced by Bill Nighy questioning about the failure of humanity. The humour is all in the irony and is more uncertain and aloof than This is the End (which is still funny at parts but feels a little generic with all the sex jokes) and more comical, less pretentious, and more nonsense than Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (which was one of the worst films and so-called comedies in recent years). A few points of concern is how it had the unfortunate time being released near to This is the End (think Deep Impact and Armageddon) and how the BBFC and MPAA did not manage to indicate there was as much gore, violence, and drinking the film had (only profanity and sex references were indicated). Its a 15 certificate in the UK and an R rating in America but the gory nastiness, which is all in blue ink, could be off-putting for some.All-in-all, the film was much more of a blast than I could have expected given its less-than-stellar return in box office returns in Great Britain. While this may offend fans but this film makes Shaun of the Dead look like over-hyped, slightly boring drivel. It is more in-line with Hot Fuzz which was a very strong police parody in its own right as well as Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (directed by Edgar Wright but is a stand-alone film) and Paul (which, contrary to popular belief, is not part of the Cornetto trilogy) with their outlandish but funny premises. Whether you are in need of some shiny light of humour (albeit dark and ironic in this film) or anything, you cannot go wrong with The World's End.""",5,"Don't come with expectations, this is post-modern darkly comic gold.
