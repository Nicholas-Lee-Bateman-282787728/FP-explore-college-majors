It's about Chihaya and his partner Kagetsuya. There's a plot line, and yeah you get stories about angels judgeing humans and the world being saved and destroyed and all that. But really it's the character and relationship develpment with the two main cast members. It was my first DVD I bought, and I was quiet thrilled. I'm a rabid yaoi fan girl and I thought little Chihaya would only give hints and leave me guessing. But nope, they even sleep in the same bed. So yep, I'm happy! ^.^ What next... Kizuna or Fake?

565017,A2A5J21CI40RKT,B000053V56,"Asphalt Jungle Guide ""njsurfer""","[7, 10]","I picked this up because I've heard lots of references to it, and it has a strong fan following.  It's apparently something of a classic.Well, I'll say this... part of being a classic is age, and ""Earthian"" shows it.  For viewers more familiar with CG and 3D rendered anime (I.G Production, Gonzo, etc.), the animation quality will disappoint.  Most of the scenes freeze at the end, with dialogue still going on, and the segues from one mjaor scene to another are pretty much full-stop-then-play, not the smooth blending we've become accustomed too.Dub-wise, this was put together, if I read the dates right, just when English-speaking voice actors were beginning to get their 'sea legs' so to speak, so quality varies.  Can't say the sub version impressed me all that much either.Chihaya, the black-haired angel, proved the major drawback for me.  Supposedly a powerful angel in his own right, he gets captured repeatedly and seems unable to do anything but kick his feet and scream for his partner's help when he's in a hold that he should be able to break out of.  I won't call it 'girly' behavior because it's an insult to girls.  (And his wailing and cringing is just as bad in Japanese, so the dub can't be blamed.)The story concepts are rather dated as well.  Sci-fi elements that seem quite funny, which is too bad as they're meant to be serious and tragic, and Big Bad Military themes.Despite this, the characterizations are good for their time.  If they ever decide to re-master/issue a special edition to bring things up to a modern audience's expectations, it might very well be a better OVA.  Until then, the appeal of this OVA will most likely be yaoi or anime completeists, or pop culture historians who enjoy noting how a form of entertainment evolves over time.",2,A dated shounen-ai classic.,1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,1778,"['picked', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'lots', 'references', 'strong', 'fan', 'following', 'apparently', 'something', 'classic.Well', ""'ll"", 'say', 'part', 'being', 'classic', 'age', 'Earthian', 'viewers', 'more', 'familiar', 'CG', '3D', 'rendered', 'anime', 'I.G', 'Production', 'Gonzo', 'etc', 'animation', 'quality', 'will', 'disappoint', 'Most', 'scenes', 'freeze', 'end', 'dialogue', 'still', 'going', 'segues', 'one', 'mjaor', 'scene', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'full-stop-then-play', 'not', 'smooth', 'blending', ""'ve"", 'become', 'accustomed', 'too.Dub-wise', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'read', 'dates', 'right', 'just', 'when', 'English-speaking', 'voice', 'actors', 'were', 'beginning', 'get', ""'sea"", 'legs', 'so', 'speak', 'quality', 'varies', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'sub', 'version', 'impressed', 'that', 'much', 'either.Chihaya', 'black-haired', 'angel', 'proved', 'major', 'drawback', 'Supposedly', 'powerful', 'angel', 'own', 'right', 'captured', 'repeatedly', 'unable', 'do', 'anything', 'kick', 'feet', 'scream', 'partner', 'help', 'when', 'hold', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'break', 'wo', ""n't"", 'call', ""'girly"", 'behavior', 'insult', 'girls', 'wailing', 'cringing', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'Japanese', 'dub', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'blamed', 'story', 'concepts', 'are', 'rather', 'dated', 'as', 'well', 'Sci-fi', 'elements', 'seem', 'quite', 'funny', 'too', 'bad', ""'re"", 'meant', 'be', 'serious', 'tragic', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Military', 'themes.Despite', 'characterizations', 'are', 'good', 'time', 'ever', 'decide', 're-master/issue', 'special', 'edition', 'bring', 'things', 'up', 'modern', 'audience', 'expectations', 'might', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'better', 'OVA', 'then', 'appeal', 'OVA', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'yaoi', 'anime', 'completeists', 'pop', 'culture', 'historians', 'who', 'enjoy', 'noting', 'how', 'form', 'entertainment', 'evolves', 'time']",Earthian

The story involves Angels sent down from Eden to decide the fate of Earth. The characters were designed with an amazing amount of detail along with the backdrop. The second story was a bit weak but it was still enjoyable. However, there is a huge gap between the second and the third stories, so pay close attention or you might be confused. The characters were developed rather well, except that Chihaya's character (one of the main ones) was extremely annoying, but that made him hilarious at the same time. I couldn't stop laughing, so it was forgivable.

Although the animation is good, and the music is better, the story - as has been stated in previous reviews - is not very easy to follow.  There are a few holes, and I thought the description on the back of the DVD was slightly misleading in that I expected this to ultimately deal with something akin to the end of the world in a supernatural sense (Armageddon?).  I was totally unprepared for the homosexual implications introduced in the story, although I was not disturbed by that.  The character development is good, particularly for the two main characters, but some of the other characters were merely introduced and then abandoned.  In conclusion, this is not an anime for everyone.  For newbies, I would recommend something lighter - &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot;, for example.  (There are angel-like beings in that one, if you're looking for angels.)  &quot;Earthian&quot; left me with an incomplete feeling, and I wish I had known how disjointed this story was before investing in this DVD.",3,Interesting and Strange...Moreso Than Your Average Anime,989884800,"05 15, 2001",2001,1132,"['Having', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'must', 'say', 'would', 'definitely', 'not', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'new', 'anime', 'animation', 'good', 'music', 'better', 'story', 'been', 'stated', 'previous', 'reviews', 'not', 'very', 'easy', 'follow', 'are', 'few', 'holes', 'thought', 'description', 'back', 'DVD', 'was', 'slightly', 'misleading', 'expected', 'ultimately', 'deal', 'something', 'akin', 'end', 'world', 'supernatural', 'sense', 'Armageddon', 'was', 'totally', 'unprepared', 'homosexual', 'implications', 'introduced', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'disturbed', 'character', 'development', 'good', 'particularly', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'merely', 'introduced', 'then', 'abandoned', 'conclusion', 'not', 'anime', 'everyone', 'newbies', 'would', 'recommend', 'something', 'lighter', 'quot', 'Vision', 'Escaflowne', 'quot', 'example', 'are', 'angel-like', 'beings', 'one', ""'re"", 'looking', 'angels', 'quot', 'Earthian', 'quot', 'left', 'incomplete', 'feeling', 'wish', 'had', 'known', 'how', 'disjointed', 'story', 'was', 'investing', 'DVD']",Earthian
565021,A4SYRXDRE8IX9,B000053V56,Maya,"[14, 16]","Okay, two points to make here. One, if you don't like shonen-ai (um... boy love) too much, then this won't be too bad for you. There's only one really gross scene, but it's so short, I don't see how it can be offensive. Two, if you really like the really lovish scenes where they kiss a lot and all that, then this won't really help you much. As I said, the only time I saw them kiss was this one time in the third episode, Fallen Angel. The art's okay, and it reminds me a lot of Gravitation, meaning it's totally kawaii- cute. I trust Yun Kouga, and I totally trust this show. I liked it, but it didn't really stick to the whole Judgement theme they depicted...

565022,A2AXNXBHIGHCDL,B000053V56,"Rowena Wendy Lim ""anime reviewer""","[2, 5]","Earthian is a cunningly presented trap -- and I fell for it, hook, line and sinker. To quote a sentence from the back of the DVD: &quot;Two angels descend from the heavens, their purpose is to judge humanity -- and each other.&quot;. The summary on the video's case gives you the impression that this anime is an all-encompassing heaven and earth epic. Hah! Earthian is anything but that, I tell you. I fell asleep five times trying to finish the four episodes that make up the Earthian Angelic Collection. The characters are bland, the pacing is a drag, and the plot is a mess. The episodes are loosely connected, which makes it difficult to integrate the events as a whole. If anything, this anime is all about Chihaya and his hang-up / angst about his black wings. Kagetsuya just pops up to rescue Chihaya from whatever trouble he gets himself into. That's it, and it's stretched out into four eps that seem to last forever. There's also a gay love scene between the two angels that seems out of place. I mean, the story doesn't even give the slightest impression that Kagetsuya and Chihaya are lovers, so imagine my surprise when the next scene featured the two naked in bed. Yes, Chihaya is a he, even if he looks and acts a lot like a she. The art and animation are basically okay. The angelic cast look quite majestic in their full angel forms, but the non-angels look so-so at best. Whatever happened to the part where the angels are supposed to judge humanity?
