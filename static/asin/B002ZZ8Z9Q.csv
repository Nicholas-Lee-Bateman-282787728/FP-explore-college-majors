The cast are all very intriguing and it was great watching them critically think to establish electricity & other real-world problems they would face if this were real. I was skeptical about how accurate it was going to be because I figured that the people would realize that it wasn't going to last forever, but after a couple weeks they were completely immersed in the experience.

In order to go to THOSE! places you have to make it a reality show and though that's normally indication what you're going to watch is really ""B"" material.  Such is not the case with ""The Colony."" Though the behaviorists probably talk too much during the show, one can't help themselves from wanting to talk to the guy/girl next to you and discuss what you would have done/would do were you in the same situation.  Yes, you find yourself screaming at the screen at times trying to give the participants some clue as to what they should be doing or shouldn't be doing, almost even to the morbid point of finding yourself staring open mouthed as some of the harder hitting things happening (like the participants getting their food, survival items taken from them by researcher provided marauders), much in the same way you can't help but stand up and cheer when you see the participants do surprisingly well for themselves (like when the blonde housewife tries to take off the head of one of the researcher provided bad guys, or when a dwarfed martial artist drops one of the huge, muscle-bound researcher provided bad guys to the mat with a roundhouse kick to the head).  Plain and simple, this is riveting television.  By the time the end rolls around, if you haven't come to the opinion brain-washing is absolutely possible, you're a bit dim!

This is the type of show, where no really good fight sceanes are done, in fact there is very little bleeding; unless you include the minor cuts and vehicle accidents. What I loved about the show was how they created some neat items out of scraps. Like:1) A water purfication system, using a trash can, sand and charcoal.2) Making gas out of wood chips.3) Creating a power plant; first by using gas and then solar pannels.4) A solar power car was created for scavenging food.There were lame moments, like the ending, the drama and finding power tools out of nowhere.",3,This is where Mcguyver meets Mad Max,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",2014,622,"['reallity', 'series', 'dubbed', 'experiment', 'type', 'show', 'where', 'really', 'good', 'fight', 'sceanes', 'are', 'done', 'fact', 'very', 'little', 'bleeding', 'include', 'minor', 'cuts', 'vehicle', 'accidents', 'What', 'loved', 'show', 'was', 'how', 'created', 'neat', 'items', 'scraps', 'Like:1', 'A', 'water', 'purfication', 'system', 'using', 'trash', 'can', 'sand', 'charcoal.2', 'Making', 'gas', 'wood', 'chips.3', 'Creating', 'power', 'plant', 'first', 'using', 'gas', 'then', 'solar', 'pannels.4', 'solar', 'power', 'car', 'was', 'created', 'scavenging', 'food.There', 'were', 'lame', 'moments', 'ending', 'drama', 'finding', 'power', 'tools', 'nowhere']",N/A

1314727,A1N2E1GTHUSG7P,B002ZZ8Z9Q,Ryoko's Husband,"[1, 5]","Greetings;Ordinarily I cannot stand reality tv shows, the two series that are animated are decent enough for a laugh-drawn together and total drama. There are even scientists that suggest a theory that the end of the world, as far as humans are concerned will be caused by reality tv shows. I don't personally agree with this belief, but I can at times certainly see where such a theory could exist though. Honestly, shows like survivor just bore me, deadliest catch is only really okay in my book because I grew up in Alaska and heard about such fishing trips, knew people who would regularly go on them. This series appeals more to my facination with the Fallout RPG series, surviving in a world where people have been nearly wiped out. Having to actually deal with possible contamination, disease, aggressors, scavenging. In the survivor scenario, there is food and water all around them if you only just know where to look. In such a setting as this, you have to get more creative because there are so many unknown factors involved. Would have only been made better if they had to also contend with traps-not that they didn't work on security on their initial facility, but I mean actually trip-wires hidden around the places they visit in search of food. I mean, even a bunch of cans on strings! But, never-the-less, a good show. I especially enjoyed when they scavenged the solar panals, found that all rather intersting. I know that the people that are sent in to antagonize the group-the marauders, raiders, the two people who had originally lived in their facility, were always instructed not to hurt anybody, but, I mean, the people do realize of course that its a show. Would be a bit over the top if the colonists should start to make weapons that they really intended to use, I mean, what if the colonists really did end up beating one of the outsiders to death? End up eating the remains...Decorating with the skeleton and skins? Now that would be interesting, but it wouldn't make it on TV.Thank you and take care...",5,"A show preparing you for the end of the world as we know it, possibly by what caused it too...",1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,2031,"['Greetings', 'Ordinarily', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'reality', 'tv', 'shows', 'two', 'series', 'are', 'animated', 'are', 'decent', 'enough', 'laugh-drawn', 'together', 'total', 'drama', 'are', 'even', 'scientists', 'suggest', 'theory', 'end', 'world', 'as', 'far', 'humans', 'are', 'concerned', 'will', 'be', 'caused', 'reality', 'tv', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'personally', 'agree', 'belief', 'can', 'times', 'certainly', 'see', 'where', 'theory', 'could', 'exist', 'Honestly', 'survivor', 'just', 'deadliest', 'catch', 'only', 'really', 'okay', 'book', 'grew', 'up', 'Alaska', 'heard', 'such', 'fishing', 'trips', 'knew', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'regularly', 'go', 'series', 'appeals', 'more', 'facination', 'Fallout', 'RPG', 'series', 'surviving', 'world', 'where', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'nearly', 'wiped', 'out', 'Having', 'actually', 'deal', 'possible', 'contamination', 'disease', 'aggressors', 'scavenging', 'survivor', 'scenario', 'food', 'water', 'only', 'just', 'know', 'where', 'look', 'such', 'setting', 'have', 'get', 'more', 'creative', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'unknown', 'factors', 'involved', 'Would', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'made', 'better', 'had', 'also', 'contend', 'traps-not', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'security', 'initial', 'facility', 'mean', 'actually', 'trip-wires', 'hidden', 'places', 'visit', 'search', 'food', 'mean', 'even', 'bunch', 'cans', 'strings', 'never-the-less', 'good', 'show', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'when', 'scavenged', 'solar', 'panals', 'found', 'rather', 'intersting', 'know', 'people', 'are', 'sent', 'antagonize', 'group-the', 'marauders', 'raiders', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'originally', 'lived', 'facility', 'were', 'always', 'instructed', 'not', 'hurt', 'anybody', 'mean', 'people', 'do', 'realize', 'course', 'show', 'Would', 'be', 'bit', 'top', 'colonists', 'should', 'start', 'make', 'weapons', 'really', 'intended', 'use', 'mean', 'what', 'colonists', 'really', 'did', 'end', 'up', 'beating', 'one', 'outsiders', 'death', 'End', 'up', 'eating', 'remains', 'Decorating', 'skeleton', 'skins', 'Now', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'TV.Thank', 'take', 'care']",N/A
