A lot of times we forget we can not feel what they feel but need to appreciate  them and go where they are at, until they can work through the personal side.

However, the family (her husband, her other [""normal""] children and a live-in nanny from England) pretend that they can see her un-seeable daughter, refusing to institutionalize her, nor otherwise alarm her.It's a good ""psychological study"" movie (that also is a commentary on family love and loyalty) and I certainly encourage one and all (particularly ""psych"" majors) to obtain a copy, because it will hold your attention (and through more than one viewing) and the ending MIGHT surprise (and please) you.",4,A most unusual movie,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,839,"['premise', 'movie', 'simple', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'real-life', 'wife', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'woman', 'who', 'daughter', 'whom', 'one', 'can', 'see.It', 'never', 'completely', 'explained', 'movie', 'why', 'child', 'why', ""n't"", 'realize', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'touch', 'child', 'However', 'family', 'husband', 'other', '[', 'normal', ']', 'children', 'live-in', 'nanny', 'England', 'pretend', 'can', 'see', 'un-seeable', 'daughter', 'refusing', 'institutionalize', 'otherwise', 'alarm', 'her.It', 'good', 'psychological', 'study', 'movie', 'also', 'commentary', 'family', 'love', 'loyalty', 'certainly', 'encourage', 'one', 'particularly', 'psych', 'majors', 'obtain', 'copy', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'ending', 'MIGHT', 'surprise', 'please']",N/A

The movie is devoted to watching this nutcase interact with thin air with the aid of her other daughter and husband. With no set up or backstory, you're immediately thrust into this family who has been dealing with mom's issue for about five years already. This movie is totally illogical and I suppose would be touching if it wasn't so absurd. There are SO many entertaining parts of this movie however. Anytime that the mother is out in public with her ""child"" is a riot. I don't know what would possess anyone to be a part of this film.
