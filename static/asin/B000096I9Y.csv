Marold""","[0, 0]","Like so many other reviewers we see here, I saw this film in the theatre when I was in high school, and I believe it was the first of several for which I forms a somewhat idolatrous adoration. I'm certain I saw it twice, because I dragged my high school chums in to watch it after seeing it alone. They were far less impressed. Were I to have reviewed it then, I would give it five stars, with a bullet. If I were to have reviewed it 20 years ago, I may have given it three stars. Now, having survived on the market for about 50 years, I have to bow to its place as a classic among documentaries. According to the Wikipedia, it created a whole genre based on imitation of this film.A lion's share of the visceral impact of the film must go to the classic theme, ""More"" which has survived and succeeded even more than the film.My strongest recollection from so many years ago (and strong it is, so it must have made a dramatic impact on my psyche) is of the final segment dedicated to the cargo cults among the natives of the South Pacific, based on their observations of airplanes landing during WW II on small island airfields, delivering supplies to the garrisons and for ships which may dock for supplies. I was almost willing to believe that this whole segment was made up, until I discovered (not easy back in those days, before the Internet) that cargo cults were real, doing precisely what the film said they did. Now that doesn't mean the scenes in that segment were not staged, but there is a reassurance that they were representing reality.The film probably has a far lower visceral impact today than it did 50 years ago, but as a milestone in film history, it seems to have earned a place.

752603,A3G0TESLQF4HFK,B000096I9Y,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[1, 1]","Mondo Cane was the original ""shockumentary"" which featured wierd customs and practices from all over the world. The footage was directed by Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi and created quite a stir upon its original release in 1962. This was the original ""mondo"" documentary. Essentially a reporter would go out, turn his camera on and what footage he got became a feature.The controversial nature of the film cannot be denied but it looks tame by today's standards. While not always easy to watch the film has a lyrical beauty to it and the restoration bt Blue Underground is stunning. The film itself is more of a carnival type freak show than an actual National Geograhic type documentary and the directors clearly went on all occassions for the shock value of the subject matter. The animal killing scenes are the best example that come to mind here.In the long run Mondo Cane is a film that should be seen for its historical value and for the inclusion of the Academy Award nominated song ""More"" but it has the same fascination as does the carnage following a traffic accident. This is the film that spawned all manner of successors including the current craze of reality television. The film originally banned in many countries is quite tame today.The disc features trailers , photo galleries and an essay on mondo cinema.",3,A Dog's Life,1340668800,"06 26, 2012",2012,1335,"['Mondo', 'Cane', 'was', 'original', 'shockumentary', 'featured', 'wierd', 'customs', 'practices', 'world', 'footage', 'was', 'directed', 'Gualtiero', 'Jacopetti', 'Franco', 'Prosperi', 'created', 'quite', 'stir', 'original', 'release', '1962', 'was', 'original', 'mondo', 'documentary', 'Essentially', 'reporter', 'would', 'go', 'out', 'turn', 'camera', 'what', 'footage', 'got', 'became', 'feature.The', 'controversial', 'nature', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'watch', 'film', 'lyrical', 'beauty', 'restoration', 'bt', 'Blue', 'Underground', 'stunning', 'film', 'more', 'carnival', 'type', 'freak', 'show', 'actual', 'National', 'Geograhic', 'type', 'documentary', 'directors', 'clearly', 'went', 'occassions', 'shock', 'value', 'subject', 'matter', 'animal', 'killing', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'example', 'come', 'mind', 'long', 'run', 'Mondo', 'Cane', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'historical', 'value', 'inclusion', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nominated', 'song', 'More', 'same', 'fascination', 'carnage', 'following', 'traffic', 'accident', 'film', 'spawned', 'manner', 'successors', 'including', 'current', 'craze', 'reality', 'television', 'film', 'originally', 'banned', 'many', 'countries', 'quite', 'tame', 'today.The', 'disc', 'trailers', 'photo', 'galleries', 'essay', 'mondo', 'cinema']",N/A

Although this film is extremely tame by todays standards, it does rank as a legendary milestone in film history.  It whisks you around the world and records all types of human oddities, aimed merely to shock the viewer.I found this film more interesting than shocking though.  This isn't half as dark and brutal as the filmmakers later offering, the horrendous Africa Addio.  Plus overall we've been possibly desensitized by stuff like Faces of Death and other bracing footage caught on the camcorder.This does show some animal killings, but nothing too offensive.  Some snakes getting cut up, wild boars getting bludgeoned to death.  You've probably seen worse.One scene it showed a tribe where the most beautiful women would constantly eat to fatten up and pop out kids for the chief.  He prefers more cushion for the pushin, heh-heh.Overall, this is an important piece of filmmaking that inspired countless ripoffs.

752606,AKV5IE177U3W4,B000096I9Y,Howard S. Gay Jr.,"[12, 14]","I love this film even more now than when it first appeared 46 years ago! And now it has been lovingly repackaged and smartly re-presented with many Special Features on DVD thanks to ""Blue Underground"". It seems to be made from a master copy or perhaps it has been digitally remastered. I think it's brilliant in every way, humour, satire, direction and is a classic in cinematography! It's also a fun filled romp around the globe with rare footage of tribal ritual. So thrill to the bizzare practices, chill to the savagry. SEE the living dead in the House of Death in Singapore...SEE a real case of Elephantitus on the feet of a villager and men hoaxing their own drowning. Observe Aborigines create a Cult of the Cargo Planes (which come from Heaven)! And real cavemen also add to the anthropoogical value. But there is also much spectacular voyeuristic eye candy and gay festivities and celebrations. And in the long tradition of exploitation films, this was a great leap forward. But it has also been described as ""Shockumentary"". Mondo Cane refers to a ""World gone to the Dogs""!  But romantics take heart: the paradox is that although  it's a satirical film, the soundtrack is the music/lyrics of a great love song ""More"" which was recorded by several vocalists such as Della Reese and was nominated for an Oscar. With two years in the making, one is reminded of the struggle in the making of Apocalypse Now! And the tradition has continued with many spin-offs, even the Peckinpah's, the Tarantino's, and grind house kung fu and women's prison movies.

A world traveler may go seeking the strange, the unusual, the bizarre and occasionally the forbidden and often find much more than he bargained for. That is what the film ""Mondo Cane"" is all about. It is a black collection of the many unusual parts of our strange world. The film travels around the globe seeking out the odd customs of various people and offers them up as interesting fare to the ambivalent traveler, the timidly interested and the curiously morbid. In each country visited, we find that what one nation finds disgusting, another finds tolerable. One nation offers up unusual human sexual practices, which another country often finds offensive, tasteless and guttural. Animals in one country are revered, honored and treated as royalty. Yet in a neighboring nation, these same beasts are prepared as special delicacies fit for consumption. Women, boys and pain seeking parishioners are accepted as sacrificial fodder. Viewers are treated to the world's most primitive customs and often as not we see ourselves at the very depth of depravity and learn it is not polite to stare, which we do anyway. A frightening movie, but one which reveals much about us than we care to know. Still, one cannot turn away without wanting to see 'MORE' which happens to be the Theme Song of this same picture. ****",4,""" Enter at your own risk, the world of the  forbidden.
