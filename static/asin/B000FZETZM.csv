997471,AY12DBB0U420B,B000FZETZM,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Some time ago, I found ""The Complete Shiloh Film Collection"" on the bargain rack of a nearby Ross Store. It wouldn't be my favorite type of films to view, but I have a young boy (approaching 4) and he's going to like stuff like this before long. These are movies the whole family might watch. Well, teenagers might get a bit restless but kids from 6 to 12 plus the parents could all enjoy watching them together. The set amounts to three DVDs. All are boy/dog stories in somewhat similar fashion to the ""Lassie"" movies of old, although I think the ""Lassie"" series are better movies.In the ""Shiloh"" film, a small beagle pup was rescued by Marty, a twelve-year-old boy, from his mean and cruel owner (Judd). A boy/dog love bond formed and Judd tried, without success, to get the dog back. Ultimately, he just gave up. In the next movie, ""Shiloh Season"" (or ""Shiloh 2""). the ever-meaner and ever-more-heavily drinking Judd continued trying to get Shiloh back, but his heavy drinking caused a truck wreck and a series of serious injuries. Shiloh was responsible for finding Judd and the wreck so, in effect, he rescued his former cruel owner. In the last film, ""Saving Shiloh,"" kids were behaving like kids and the group had a potentially serious swimming accident. Marty jumped into the river to rescue his sister and Shiloh jumped in to help with the situation, as best he could. Well, the girl was saved, but Shiloh became trapped in the fast-flowing current and was heading toward a water fall. At his point, Judd jumped in and managed to rescue Shiloh. So, there you have it in three movies:boy rescues dog, dog rescues former owner and former owner rescues dog.The ""Shiloh"" movies are engaging movies and are enjoyable to watch. But we're talking family fare here and not academy award stuff. Enjoy, and watch it with your young kids or grandkids if you can.Gary Peterson",4,Three Engaging Movies.

All three DVD's are great.  I also recommend them to be seen by reluctant  readers after they read the books.  This will give them a concrete visual in case they find the language a bit hard to understand.,5,Helped My Special Needs Students Appreciate the Shiloh Series,1363046400,"03 12, 2013",2013,338,"['delightful', 'set', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'compliment', 'children', 'reading', 'books', 'movies', 'seem', 'follow', 'books', 'closely', 'three', 'DVD', 'are', 'great', 'also', 'recommend', 'be', 'seen', 'reluctant', 'readers', 'read', 'books', 'will', 'give', 'concrete', 'visual', 'case', 'find', 'language', 'bit', 'hard', 'understand']",The Complete Shiloh Film Collection
