When some friends of mine suggested we rent this movie at an outing to Blockbuster Video, I wasn't very excited about it. But &quot;what the heck, I'll watch anything once.&quot; First of all, the main character was a bit annying. All the little things she did to help out the bar in an attempt to get back to work with Cyote Ugly made me want to upchuck all over the television. This movie is VERY predictable and a cliche of many others. I'm sure many of the younger generation cherish this film and that's about the only audience I think this is going to achieve except cleavage hungry boys.",1,How pitiful,981244800,"02 4, 2001",2001,647,"['consider', 'enjoy', 'wide', 'variety', 'movies', 'When', 'friends', 'mine', 'suggested', 'rent', 'movie', 'outing', 'Blockbuster', 'Video', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'excited', 'quot', 'what', 'heck', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'anything', 'once.', 'quot', 'First', 'all', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'bit', 'annying', 'little', 'things', 'did', 'help', 'out', 'bar', 'attempt', 'get', 'back', 'work', 'Cyote', 'Ugly', 'made', 'want', 'upchuck', 'television', 'movie', 'VERY', 'predictable', 'cliche', 'many', 'others', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'younger', 'generation', 'cherish', 'film', 'only', 'audience', 'think', 'going', 'achieve', 'cleavage', 'hungry', 'boys']",Coyote Ugly
564483,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,B0000524E5,absent_minded_prof,"[1, 1]","Piper Perabo plays Violet, the nice girl from Jersey who moves to NYC to try to make it big as a songwriter. She lands a job as a ""coyote"" to support herself while she gets established, singing and dancing in a wild (wild, but still basically PG-13) bar. During her personal voyage of self-discovery and growth, she meets a guy (Adam Garcia) and has various adventures, and seeks to ultimately prevail over the shyness she must conquer, to reach her goals.As a guy, I rented this for predictable reasons. Ohhh, those previews... MERCY!!! However, this really is not a simple babefest in any way. It really is mostly about Violet's personal odyssey to overcome her fears and achieve her dreams. Be warned that although it is certainly sweet, it doesn't exactly stick to your ribs. The dialog is monumentally uninspired, and probably more cliche-ridden than any movie I've seen since... ummm.. well, it's in a different genre, but I'd have to mention ""Bats.""  Come on, writers! You could have done better than that. Anyway, Violet's journey is sort of a cross between the stories of Olivia Newton-John's character in ""Grease"" and Tom Cruise's character in ""Cocktail."" That sounds freaky, but you'll see what I mean. Piper Perabo's Violet reminds me of a sort of cross between a waifish Amanda Peet and a nineties version of Audrey Hepburn, living out the story of a latter-day Minnie Pearl... There's a really fun soundtrack, which is always a plus... Also, the whole movie features a cornucopia of suspiciously well-toned midriffs -- I can just imagine all the girls in the film doing sit-up and ""crunch"" marathons between takes.Watch for Bud Cort, who played Harold in the cult favorite ""Harold and Maude!"" He plays the guy in the coffee shop, named Romero, who first introduces Violet to the other ""coyotes,"" and who gives her a free slice of pie to cheer her up.Supporting actors in general do a good job with the lines they're given. Maria Bello plays up her part well, as the brassy, tough-as-nails Lil, who owns the bar, and who becomes Violet's friend. Izabella Miko is somehow simultaneously babyishly cute, and devilish-looking, as Cammie.  Tyra Banks is gorgeous, of course, and actually a pretty good actress, I thought.  Bridget Moynahan is terrific as Rachel, the ferocious grrrrl dancer with a heart of gold -- she has such a strong presence it might get in her way, looking for future roles. Think of Linda Hamilton from the second Terminator movie, crossed with the Terminator himself, and you'll get a sense of what her character is like... John Goodman and Adam Garcia are great too -- heck, everyone does a good job, it's just that the lines are so ....Basically, this movie is a lot of fun, and it has an uplifting message, especially for younger viewers. If you want crackling dialogue, see ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" -- if you want a sweet movie that happens to have a lot of major babes in it, see ""Coyote Ugly.""

These include Top Gun, Days of Thunder, Crimson Tides, The Rock, Con Air, Enemy of The State, Armageddon, Gone in 60 seconds, and Remember the Titans. I own most of these on DVDs. The main reason I like his movies so much is because they are so entertaining and fun to watch over and over again. They have so much energy and heart, detailed characterization, setting, irony, and plot. No matter who the actors or directors are, Bruckheimer's movies are usually very entertaining. I would watch any movies made by Jerry Bruckheimer, and I am eagerly waiting for &quot;Pearl Harber&quot; to come out in movie theaters Memorial Day. Coyote Ugly is very different from the rest of Bruckheimer movies. Simply put, it is a girl's movie as opposed to being a guy's movie. In this film, the women ruled as agonists and the men are basically background settings and antagonists. Obviously I have a problem with that, being a man and all :) Another weak point was the use of sex. By that, I mean it relied too heavily on sexuality to carry the film, instead of relying on just plot, action, setting, and special effects---the usual good stuff. I mean sex is great, but you shouldn't have to rely on that like this film did. I don't know. Maybe I did not like it so much only because it did not have enough testosterone like the other Jerry Bruckheimer movies. Besides that, this movie did have plot and plenty of heart.",3,Women Movie Coyote,978048000,"12 29, 2000",2000,1483,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'think', 'movies', 'are', 'coolest', 'include', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Days', 'Thunder', 'Crimson', 'Tides', 'Rock', 'Con', 'Air', 'Enemy', 'State', 'Armageddon', 'Gone', '60', 'seconds', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'own', 'most', 'DVDs', 'main', 'reason', 'movies', 'so', 'much', 'are', 'so', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'energy', 'heart', 'detailed', 'characterization', 'setting', 'irony', 'plot', 'No', 'matter', 'who', 'actors', 'directors', 'are', 'Bruckheimer', 'movies', 'are', 'usually', 'very', 'entertaining', 'would', 'watch', 'movies', 'made', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'am', 'eagerly', 'waiting', 'quot', 'Pearl', 'Harber', 'quot', 'come', 'out', 'movie', 'theaters', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'very', 'different', 'rest', 'Bruckheimer', 'movies', 'Simply', 'put', 'girl', 'movie', 'opposed', 'being', 'guy', 'movie', 'film', 'women', 'ruled', 'agonists', 'men', 'are', 'basically', 'background', 'settings', 'antagonists', 'Obviously', 'have', 'problem', 'being', 'man', 'weak', 'point', 'was', 'use', 'sex', 'mean', 'relied', 'too', 'heavily', 'sexuality', 'carry', 'film', 'instead', 'relying', 'just', 'plot', 'action', 'setting', 'special', 'effects', '-the', 'usual', 'good', 'stuff', 'mean', 'sex', 'great', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'rely', 'film', 'did', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Maybe', 'did', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'only', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'testosterone', 'other', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'movies', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'plot', 'plenty', 'heart']",Coyote Ugly

Violet Stanford serves a pizza; she is leaving. [Is it really &#8220;42 miles to New York city&#8221;?] She says goodbye to her Dad. They show scenes of NY. Violet rents an apartment. Will she become a songwriter? Can her dreams come true? Is it hard to break into show business? Will Violet be deceived? She learns fast. She is told about &#8220;open mike&#8221; night. Stage fright? Upon her return home she finds her apartment burglarized and trashed. She sees young woman in a diner talk about their jobs. Violet applies for a job. It requires performance and following the rules. [$4 for a beer&#8221;] Can she keep up? [Is that the kind of job she can retire from?]She talks to her Dad. Then retrieves her tape. She shops for new clothes. She is told how to handle her drinks: a beer chaser. One man orders water! Violet has a scheme to raise money from the audience; will it work? Equal rights? It works. She meets O&#8217;Donnell, he likes comic books. At dawn they go to the fish market. &#8220;Have a nice day.&#8221; Is the bar overcrowded? Is there a way to quiet rowdy customers? Violet sings. Later she meets O&#8217;Donnell is private for a friendly get together. Violet learns how to serve bottle beer at work. [Shaking a beer bottle before opening it!] What if her father visits her place of work? &#8220;Its not as bad as it looks. Its just a bar.&#8221; Will Violet keep her appointment to audition? Will there be another fight at that bar? [Does Manhattan attract unattached young people who seek anonymity in a crowd?] Will Violet have to change jobs? She attends a wedding and talks to her Dad. [Note all the locks on her Manhattan apartment door!]Violet gets a telephone call about her father. He had an accident at work, hit by a car. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; Her tapes are returned. Violet decides to return home. Her father speaks about Violet&#8217;s mother. She will try again to sing at an audition. Her former boss shows up to offer her a job. But they like her song at the &#8220;Bowery Ballroom&#8221;. Can she do it? She sings and dances. Will her dreams come true? Violet returns to the &#8220;Coyote Ugly&#8221; bar. Can she find a date for her Dad? [Is this believable?] And so it ends. [You can only guess what happens next. Will she become a one-hit wonder?]The credits list the names of the dance doubles and stunt doubles. Were you surprised? This is at best an average story or movie. It tells about the night life in lower Manhattan. Would you like to live there? One educational scene is about the &#8220;beer chaser&#8221;. I wonder if it gets rebottled and sold to customers? Those who live or work in that area can best comment on it. Overall, is seems false. It seems like a fantasy to think you have to live in Manhattan to be a song writer. That only benefits the owners of tenements. Buddy Holly did not live in Manhattan, nor did Jan & Dean. Can you think of others? A short train ride away is good enough for most people. Isn&#8217;t it better to live among real people than the characters in that saloon? This is another exploitation movie that fools the viewers.

Piper Perabo plays Violet, a girl who's dream is to move to New York to become a Song writer.  While she's trying to get people to listen to her demos, she meets a charming fellow named Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia).  Lacking cash, Violet gets a job at a bar called Coyote Ugly, where the girls dress sexy and dance on the bar for the entertainment of the bar goers.  There are so many different stories weaved into this movie, that it would take forever to describe them all.  That and the fact that I don't want to be a spoiler for those who haven't seen the movie.  But let me say this...like any teeny bopper flick, it goes along the story line.  Girl meets guy, they fall in love, they break up, but in the end they end up back together.  However, I wouldn't limit this movie only to teeny boppers.  When I went to the theater, I saw people of all ages sitting and enjoying the movie.  Personally, I loved it so much that after watching it twice in the theater, I ran out and bought the soundtrack (which is incredible) and waited, anticipating the release of this really great movie.  When it was released, I found out that it was only coming out on DVD, which is a real shame, because not everyone has a DVD player, but since I am a devoted fan, I will anticipate the release of this video on VHS.

Oh, yeah, that would be the likes of Piper Perabo, Izabella Miko and Bridget Moynahan scantily clad, dancing on a bar with booze.  Yeah, that's what I like so much about this movie.The plot behind `Coyote Ugly' is rather predictable and generic.  Violet wants to be a big music star but she has to fight her nerves to finally get noticed.  She shops around her demo tapes but that's kind of pointless.  When she's finally destitute she starts bartending at this crazy bar where girls act like strippers for major tips.  She's green, and pretty bad at it, but she's hot and so the owner (a pretty grounded and authentic Maria Bello) allows her to flub up as long as she keeps trying, and she does, and supposedly dancing on tables gave her the courage to face her biggest fears and just sing her heart out.Well, her boyfriend has to turn off the lights first.Like I said, this film is rather stupid, but it embraces that stupidity and makes up for it with layers and layers of fun.  The sensuality is all over the place, in a good way.  The film totally capitalizes on the draw of the actresses (I'm so glad that Jessica Simpson didn't get Perabo's role, but I'm saddened that this was basically the beginning and end of Perabo) and uses their bodies to an extreme.If you've never been to a Coyote Ugly, I urge you to make the trip; it's fun!Bello and Perabo and Goodman actually pull in really nice performances here.  Moynahan and Miko don't have a lot to do outside of be really hot, and they master that (especially Miko), so job well done.  Adam Garcia is pretty bad here.  I wish that Melanie Lynskey could get more work.  I love her, and she is SOOO talented (watch `Heavenly Creatures', NOW!).  She has yet another thankless supporting role here.  Why is it that the less conventionally attractive girls get shafted in this industry?Tyra Banks makes me laugh, but not because of this movie.All in all, I totally recommend this movie.  I mean, it's a ton of fun, and you can't go wrong with honky tonk, stripper action in bars (and the whole meaning behind the bars name is just genius).",3,"This film may be `ugly', but I wouldn't gnaw my arm off to get away!",1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,2212,"['know', 'movie', 'kind', 'okay', 'lot', 'stupid', 'something', 'movie', 'really', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'would', 'be', 'likes', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'Izabella', 'Miko', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'scantily', 'dancing', 'bar', 'booze', 'Yeah', 'what', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'movie.The', 'plot', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'rather', 'predictable', 'generic', 'Violet', 'be', 'big', 'music', 'star', 'fight', 'nerves', 'finally', 'get', 'noticed', 'demo', 'tapes', 'kind', 'pointless', 'When', 'finally', 'destitute', 'bartending', 'crazy', 'bar', 'where', 'girls', 'act', 'strippers', 'major', 'tips', 'green', 'pretty', 'bad', 'hot', 'so', 'owner', 'pretty', 'grounded', 'authentic', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'flub', 'up', 'as', 'long', 'trying', 'supposedly', 'dancing', 'tables', 'gave', 'courage', 'face', 'biggest', 'fears', 'just', 'sing', 'heart', 'out.Well', 'boyfriend', 'turn', 'off', 'lights', 'first.Like', 'said', 'film', 'rather', 'stupid', 'stupidity', 'up', 'layers', 'layers', 'fun', 'sensuality', 'place', 'good', 'way', 'film', 'totally', 'draw', 'actresses', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'Jessica', 'Simpson', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Perabo', 'role', ""'m"", 'saddened', 'was', 'basically', 'beginning', 'end', 'Perabo', 'bodies', 'extreme.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'urge', 'make', 'trip', 'fun', 'Bello', 'Perabo', 'Goodman', 'actually', 'really', 'nice', 'performances', 'here', 'Moynahan', 'Miko', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'do', 'be', 'really', 'hot', 'master', 'especially', 'Miko', 'so', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'Adam', 'Garcia', 'pretty', 'bad', 'here', 'wish', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'could', 'get', 'more', 'work', 'love', 'SOOO', 'talented', 'watch', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'NOW', 'yet', 'thankless', 'supporting', 'role', 'here', 'Why', 'less', 'conventionally', 'attractive', 'girls', 'get', 'shafted', 'industry', 'Tyra', 'Banks', 'laugh', 'not', 'movie.All', 'totally', 'recommend', 'movie', 'mean', 'ton', 'fun', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'honky', 'tonk', 'stripper', 'action', 'bars', 'whole', 'meaning', 'bars', 'name', 'just', 'genius']",Coyote Ugly

564508,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B0000524E5,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 2]","For the past 9 years I have harbored a secret desire to watch Coyote Ugly. I thought it would be extremely cheesy but that I would like it in spite of it all. A guilty pleasure. I expected to like it, like I enjoyed Flash Dance, Mystic Pizza with the debut of Julia Roberts, Bottoms Up with Paris Hilton and Jason Mewes, or Cocktail with Tom Cruise. I thought I would like it, but I didn't expect that I would like it as much as I did. Now I am wondering why I waited 9 years.Violet Sanford (Piper Pirabo) is a Pizza Waitress in New Jersey, but she dreams of moving to New York to be a Songwriter. Her mother wanted to be a singer, too, but gave it up to marry Violet's dad (John Goodman). He is a toll collector, and he depends on her a lot, now that his wife has passed away. He can't stop her from pursuing her dream, even though he'd prefer that she stayed in Jersey.Once she has moved to New York, she finds that it is tough making a living, and ends up working at a rough bar called Coyote Ugly, where the bartenders, all female, dance on the bar, and keep up a rowdy atmosphere that packs the joint nightly. What kind of drinks do they serve there?----------------------------------Customer: So, basically you have...?Lil: Jim, Jack, Johnny Red, Johnny Black, and Jose; all my favorite men. You can have it any way you like it, as long as it's in a shot glass.==========================================At first Violet/Jersey has a really rough time of it, but Lil, the owner, thinks her fresh innocent look will make up for what she lacks in experience:-------------------------------Lil: Hey, everybody, shut up! I'd like you to meet my new girl, whose name is... Jersey! Jersey, is an ex kindergarten teacher, and a former nun, who just escaped from the convent, and is tired of being the only virgin in New York City! Would anyone like to buy her a drink?===========================================Not surprisingly, quite a few want to have that privilege. After a while she fits right in, but still she wonders why the strange name?---------------------Girl: Can I ask you somethin'?Lil: What?Girl: What - Oh, what does Coyote Ugly mean?Lil: Did you ever wake up sober after a one night stand, and the person you're next to is layin' on your arm, and they're so ugly, you'd rather chew off your arm then risk waking 'em? That's coyote ugly.Girl: My God. But, why would you name your bar after somethin' like that?Lil: Oh, because Cheers was taken.=============================================Meanwhile she is making the rounds with her demo tapes and goes to another bar where the bartender tells her that Mr. O'Donnell (Adam Garcia), who is really a cook, is in charge of booking. He plays along until his boss blows his cover, and then, though he got off on the wrong foot, he keeps trying to win her over. One guess if he ever does. She is also having a hard time overcoming her stage fright, but finds that the only way to get her songs heard is to perform at the open mic. Wonder if she ever gets over that stage fright?Coyote Ugly takes what is a clich&eacute; as a story, but it is done very well. The Coyotes put on quite a show, and the dance numbers and routines in the bar are really the highlight of the film. One of the dancers, Zo, is played by Tyra Banks, who does her best Naomi Campbell impersonation. Coyote Ugly is always just on the verge of a huge bar room brawl. Piper Pirabo is really great in the lead, like Jennifer Beals in Flashdance, or Julia Roberts in Mystic Pizza. She looks a lot like Carly Simon, with a luscious full set of lips. She is really quite a pretty face, but her acting wasn't too shabby, either. I am surprised that she is not an even bigger star.Adam Garcia, as the grill cook/boyfriend, was more than adequate to the task. He is an Australian with a background in dance, and at first his career seemed to be following in John Travolta's footsteps, with parts in Australian productions of Saturday Night Fever and Grease. Luckily, his character, Kevin O'Donnell, is supposed to be from Australia, too. He has played opposite Lindsay Lohan in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen and Drew Barrymore in Riding in Cars With Boys. In Ugly, his character went beyond the basic requirements for a cute boyfriend and had a few quirks. He was a comic book collector, and trades his most prized possession, a rare Spider-man comic, for an audition for Violet. Kevin Smith (Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Chasing Amy) actually did some unaccredited work on the script, but surprisingly, though he is an avid comic collector who sold his collection to finance his early films, and then bought them back as soon as he could afford to, he didn't come up with the idea to make O'Donnell a comic collector.Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who surprised writer Gina Wendkos because that is not his usual shtick, Ugly features Johnny Knoxville (Jackass), Ellen Cleghorne (Saturday Night Live), and Bud Cort (Harold & Maude) in cameos.One aspect of Coyote Ugly that I enjoyed was the music, though the music that Violet writes, Piper Pirabo auditioning or performing the songs that she ""wrote,"" was nothing to write home about. In spite of her not really knocking me out with her singing talent, I identified with her quest, being a denizen of the open mic scene myself. She somehow managed to turn a diagnosis of the symptoms of Stage Frightus Majorious into a cute seduction scene that I forgave for its silliness for obvious reasons. There was some good music on the soundtrack. There is a song by Joe Strummer and The Mescalaros, a little INXS, some Blondie, Kid Rock, The Georgia Satellites, Reverend Horton Heat, Third Eye Blind, The Stray Cats, Billy Idol, and LeAnn Rimes even shows up as a new Coyote near the end and does a tune. LeAnn is also dubbed in when Piper is singing, but they just didn't have that great of material for her to do. I would much rather hear LeAnn's rhymes on the Patsy Cline style ""Blue"" or some hard core Country than to have her waste her pipes on the watered down pop Piper was doing. Still, the soundtrack album did remain in the Billboard Top 40 for more than a year.Coyote Ugly? More like Coyote Lovely!Piper PiraboBeverly Hills Chihuahua(2008) ....

564509,A1Q329PGKOGLDD,B0000524E5,Chad Spivak,"[2, 3]","Jerry Bruckheimer is a wonderful director.  He continues to  display his talents in this entertaining film with a good cast.The plot is fairly simple, but it works for this movie.  A young songwriter from New Jersey, who has a severe case of stagefright, moves to New York to hopefully &quot;make it.&quot;  Stuggling financially, she takes a job as a bartender/waitress at a wild bar named &quot;Coyote Ugly.&quot;  Here, the &quot;eye-candy&quot; female bartenders partake in wild stage acts to enhance the bar's nightlife image.  While working at this bar ann befriending several other workers, the young songwriter, Violet, hopes to break into the entertainment industry.Rising star, Piper Perabo, plays the perfect Violet, and John Goodman is an excellent compliment to her as her father.  Besides, Goodman practically steals the whole movie in the very last scene, but you'll have to buy the film to see what I mean.  Maria Bello, who plays the owner of the bar, also adds in a steller performance, not to forget, Adam Garcia, who plays Violet's love interest quite nicely, although his character develops late in the film.  Add in supermodel, Tyra Banks, in a cameo role, and the movie just grows on you.On the whole, this was a pretty good movie.  It was fairly fast-paced, and the storyline, although simplistic, was well-defined.  The actresses were very pleasing to the eye, and they all acted well together, providing an overall nice cohesive film.

564521,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B0000524E5,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 0]","This is one of those titles that I find difficult to review.  I don't hate ""Coyote Ugly"" but I'm not exactly liking it all the same, and that's the basis of my opinion.  If you want to see girls having a wild and crazy time or you're the type of eccentric person who wanted something feisty to watch with friends on popcorn night, you'll probably enjoy this movie.  This movie is loud, claustrophobic, and out-of-control, if this what occurs in the real Coyote Ugly location, then I got wonder about the safety hazards if girls can dance on barstills and lit the still on fire and dance on it like a tribsman.  Of course, it could all be exaggerated for the sake of movie magic.Naming the Coyotes at heart, the leader of the pack is Lili (Maria Bello), a character I kinda like because she's direct while being level-headed, which granted is what a leader is suppose to be.  Zoe (Tyra Banks), gets the distinction of not appearing as often as the other girls.  Rachel is the self-proclaimed b-word although she's quite modest for what she is, and Cammie is the flirty type, which at least that girl lived up to her status; these two shared a special distinction of not knowing who they are before looking it up on IMDb, and even then I forgot their names.  The final Coyote is the newbie and main protagonist, Violet (Piper Perabo), who got out of the Jersey to be an aspiring songwriter in New York, which failed attempts, broken dreams and meeting her love interest led to her discovering the bar and joining in. Violet bugs me, her sweet and innocent attitude comes as rather phony, and she's not exactly hard to please.  When she met her love interest, she played the ""You're not what I'm looking for, get away from me, creepy"" gag for only a few minutes before she let that guy easily get into her heart and her 'cage'.  The romantic sub-plot between those two was cheesy and patchy, almost contrived, but I know some people eat this stuff up from ""Gossip Girl"" or ""Laguna Beach"" so this aspect is of acquired taste...of low expectations.Since I saw the unrated version and never the original, I have some thoughts on what I think are added scenes.  One scene has Violet exposing her chest during a love-making scene; visible boobs is enough to know it's an added scene and I don't think the scene had to be extended just for that, and plus, why Violet's boobs and not Lili's boobs (just as a preference)?  Another scene has the Coyotes compete in a baseball match, and Cammie stripped while on batting to ogle her competition.  She only exposed her bra and panties, but I had to think this is added for this version, but the entire scene revolved around pointless, almost insulting eye-candy.Calling ""Coyote Ugly"" shameless is rather apt.  All these girls are just strutting their stuff, and though they keep the movie exciting, I eventually got sick of their promiscuity.  It's a case of 'too much of a good thing', and besides almost of the gals are really that interesting.  But the movie knows what it wants to show, so it's not bad or good.  It just is.",3,It's ladies' night all the time...not much else,1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,3064,"['one', 'titles', 'find', 'difficult', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', ""'m"", 'not', 'exactly', 'liking', 'same', 'basis', 'opinion', 'want', 'see', 'girls', 'having', 'wild', 'crazy', 'time', ""'re"", 'type', 'eccentric', 'person', 'who', 'wanted', 'something', 'feisty', 'watch', 'friends', 'popcorn', 'night', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'movie', 'loud', 'claustrophobic', 'out-of-control', 'what', 'real', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'location', 'then', 'got', 'wonder', 'safety', 'hazards', 'girls', 'can', 'dance', 'barstills', 'lit', 'still', 'fire', 'dance', 'tribsman', 'course', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'exaggerated', 'sake', 'movie', 'magic.Naming', 'Coyotes', 'heart', 'leader', 'pack', 'Lili', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'character', 'kinda', 'direct', 'being', 'level-headed', 'granted', 'what', 'leader', 'suppose', 'be', 'Zoe', 'Tyra', 'Banks', 'distinction', 'not', 'appearing', 'as', 'often', 'other', 'girls', 'Rachel', 'self-proclaimed', 'b-word', 'quite', 'modest', 'what', 'Cammie', 'flirty', 'type', 'least', 'girl', 'lived', 'up', 'status', 'two', 'shared', 'special', 'distinction', 'not', 'knowing', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'up', 'IMDb', 'even', 'then', 'forgot', 'names', 'final', 'Coyote', 'newbie', 'main', 'protagonist', 'Violet', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'who', 'got', 'Jersey', 'be', 'aspiring', 'songwriter', 'New', 'York', 'failed', 'attempts', 'broken', 'dreams', 'meeting', 'love', 'interest', 'led', 'discovering', 'bar', 'joining', 'Violet', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'attitude', 'rather', 'phony', 'not', 'exactly', 'hard', 'please', 'When', 'met', 'love', 'interest', 'played', ""'re"", 'not', 'what', ""'m"", 'looking', 'get', 'away', 'creepy', 'gag', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'let', 'guy', 'easily', 'get', 'heart', ""'cage"", 'romantic', 'sub-plot', 'two', 'was', 'cheesy', 'patchy', 'almost', 'contrived', 'know', 'people', 'eat', 'stuff', 'up', 'Gossip', 'Girl', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'aspect', 'acquired', 'taste', 'low', 'expectations.Since', 'saw', 'unrated', 'version', 'never', 'original', 'have', 'thoughts', 'what', 'think', 'are', 'added', 'scenes', 'One', 'scene', 'Violet', 'exposing', 'chest', 'love-making', 'scene', 'visible', 'boobs', 'enough', 'know', 'added', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'scene', 'had', 'be', 'extended', 'just', 'why', 'Violet', 'boobs', 'not', 'Lili', 'boobs', 'just', 'preference', 'scene', 'Coyotes', 'compete', 'baseball', 'match', 'Cammie', 'stripped', 'batting', 'ogle', 'competition', 'only', 'exposed', 'bra', 'panties', 'had', 'think', 'added', 'version', 'entire', 'scene', 'revolved', 'pointless', 'almost', 'insulting', 'eye-candy.Calling', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'shameless', 'rather', 'apt', 'girls', 'are', 'just', 'strutting', 'stuff', 'keep', 'movie', 'exciting', 'eventually', 'got', 'sick', 'promiscuity', 'case', ""'too"", 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'almost', 'gals', 'are', 'really', 'interesting', 'movie', 'what', 'show', 'not', 'bad', 'good', 'just']",Coyote Ugly

564529,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B0000524E5,"""flickjunkie""","[2, 2]","Producer Jerry Bruckheimer seems to have an innate sense of what makes money in cinema.  He seldom makes a film that isn't profitable and has numerous blockbusters on his resume over the past 30 years (American Gigolo, Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon).  Bruckheimer is a populist producer.  He is more concerned with giving audiences what they want than he is about producing films of any artistic value or substance.  In that regard, ""Coyote Ugly"" fits right in.This film is energetic, entertaining, scintillating and fun to watch.  The story is &quot;Flashdance&quot; lite, and is reminiscent of the popular but vacuous ""Cocktail"" with Tom Cruise, only with a decent plot woven in.  Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is a young aspiring songwriter who leaves South Amboy, New Jersey traveling to New York City to be discovered.  When things don't go as planned, she takes a job as a bartender in a raucous singles bar where the sexy female bartenders dance provocatively on the bar to the shrieks of the rowdy patrons below.  Of course, there is a love story to go along with the quest for fame, completing the populist formula.Bruckheimer defies the conventional Hollywood big budget approach by using an ensemble cast of veritable unknowns and a first time director.  Other than John Goodman in a minor role, and supermodel Tyra Banks who hasn't done much acting, most of the actors have extremely short resumes.  This gives the film a freshness and energy that comes from the cast's exhilaration at just being on the set.Piper Perabo is an incredible find.  She is not simply acting in this film, but living the role.  Just like her character Violet, this film is her big break so her ability to understand the character and the role is implicit (another stroke of Bruckheimer genius).  Perabo is an excellent actor with tremendous ability and potential.  It is likely that this film will be the launch pad for a bright career.  Maria Bello also gives a fabulous performance as Lil, the tough and successful owner of the nightclub.  Australian actor Adam Garcia has great chemistry with Perabo as Violet's love interest.  His pleasant demeanor and good looks have many people comparing him with Mel Gibson, although it remains to be seen whether he can handle roles that are more substantial.  John Goodman provides one of the film's best moments when he gets up on the bar and dances as Violet auctions him off to the screaming women in the crowd.The DVD is packed with interesting special features about the making of the film.  It also includes a DTS audio option, which I like better than Dolby Digital 5.1.  The soundtrack is pulsating and explosive and pumps the film up with excitement.This is not great filmmaking, but it is great entertainment.  It is an amiable film that sparkles with energy and is easy to watch.  I rated it a 7/10.  Many people were surprised by how much they enjoyed it, but I'm never surprised when I like a Jerry Bruckheimer film.

But what a  year it has been.  Coyote Ugly is an example of a film that is not just  bad...it's not even the fun kind of bad.  It lacks the humor of &quot;The  Skulls&quot; and has the unenviable distinction of making  &quot;showgirls&quot; look good.  Really it does.  First off we have an  incredibly silly plot that looks as though it were lifted from an episode  of Fame, no, even Fame would not have been this bad.  Our heroine is a  struggling song writer who goes off to New York to write songs.. So far so  good.  Trouble is, our lead actress has yet to write or record anything at  home so she does so in the big apple...in her apartment, too bad about the  awful noise next door that she hears through the paper thin walls, what  does she do?  Why of course she does the logical thing...SHE GOES UP ON THE  ROOF AND RECORDS!  Of course the sounds of New York obligingly quite down  so she can study.  Gee...it's quite on the roof in NYC in the middle of the  night...whodathunkit?  The film goes straight downhill from there, I will  spare you the details and simply list the ludicrocities by number:1.  Her apartment is burglarized and everything of value is stolen, two scenes  later she is carrying an expensive guitar belonging to her dead mother, the  thieves found the money in the freezer but not a guitar. 2.  She helps the  dashing Australian out unloading frozen fish for several hours...her hair  and clothes are perfect afterwards. 3. She is told at the very beginning of  the film, in no uncertain terms, that no one...no one will listen to her  unsolicited tape as that is ILLEGAL AND WOULD OPEN THE PUBLISHERS TO  LAWSUITS!  Any one who had even considered a career in songwriting would  know this.  She continues to shlep the tapes around oblivious to this  incredibly obvious fact. 4.  A foot note to the above, she actually mails  out a bunch of tapes she made to the same publishers, does this girl have a  hearing problem? 5.  Her father, played by a very sorry John Goodman, sees  her in the bar at work and is ashamed, even though she is fully clothed and  not wearing anything that is not seen at any beach in America.Oh yeah,  then there is the agonizing bar scenes...oh the humanity!6.  The  barmaids set the bar on fire and are not burned, neither are any of the  customers. 7.  Anyone asking for water is sprayed with water, in fact all  the &quot;coyotes&quot; spray liquor and water all over the customers for  no apparent reason. 8.  More liquor is poured on the bar then in the  glasses, no on sees or cares.  And on and on and on and on...this film is  like running a nail down a very, very long chalkboard.  Then there is the  dialogue....  Worst lines in the film are as follows Sexy Russian barmaid:  &quot; I am not a lesbian....I played in the minors but never made the big  league&quot; The rest of the script is not much better.  When our heroine  gets her big break (she records on a CD and not on tape, I guess the  copyright laws do not go digital) she is asked by the love interest  &quot;What do you do when all of your dreams come true?&quot;  &quot;I pay  back old debts&quot; aaaaaarrrrrrhghhhhhh.  There is not one minute of  character development, not one.  We are treated to mind numbing examples of  &quot;on the nose&quot; dialogue, that is when characters say things just  to explain things to the audience.  &quot;Thanks for letting me sublease  this apartment&quot; The beautiful women says to the love interest,  wouldn't he already know he had subleased this?  I can forgive much in a  film, if it is entertaining, even unintentionally funny.  There is not one  possible thing in this film that I believe...not one.  Every character from  the overweight father who's daughter is trying to be a wife  too....&quot;dad, your eating lean cuisine, don't do the laundry I will do  it when I visit on the weekends&quot; Later dad is at a wedding minus his  socks...I guess he was mad at has daughter and can't find his socks by  himself.  The stupid contrived love story, complete with scenes of the  Brooklyn bridge at sunrise from a convertible and a scene where she can't  get to the phone in time and sees her beloved taking another women into his  apartment (of course she is subleasing...as she says later to the  audience).  If they had sat down and tried to make a stupider film with  more predictable and silly things happening they could not have done it.  Naomi Campbell is the lucky one, she is leaving at the beginning and gets  to miss most of this mess, of course she makes an appearance mid-film and  is doused with water.  There is much water dousing and no reason for it.  The actresses are all bone dry in the next scene.  I don't know how long  this film was but it was too long after the first ten minutes.  A soft core  nudity free mag called Maxim has pictures of all the girls in it.  You can  be sure this is the only kind of magazine you would see this film mentioned  in.  Save your ticket money and buy the mag.  Oh yeah, Leanne Rhymes shows  up on &quot;country night&quot; for no apparent reason and John Goodman  dances the funky chicken on the bar while screaming women bid on who gets  to take him home.

But there's so much more to Coyote Ugly than that! Although there are enough entertaining bar dancing scenes to satisfy anyone. Coyote Ugly tells the story of Violet Sanford, an aspiring songwriter who moves to New York City  -- away from her protective father -- to pursue her career. While living in a trashy apartment, she is robbed of almost everything she owns, and is quick to find a job. She finds one at Coyote Ugly, one of the hottest bars in NYC. Yet, she finds that serving at this bar is a bit difficult. You also have to dance and entertain. Among the chaos of Coyote Ugly, Violet meets a young man, and a romance is developed. The antics at the bar, Violet's search for fame, her budding romance, and some downtimes make for a nice, comfy blend of drama and comedy. Actually, the mix of drama and comedy is just right and suits the pace of the film fairly well. As there is hardly a dull moment.Piper Perabo stars as Voilet Sanford. Perabo was awesome in this movie, as she perfected at pulling off Violet's innocent yet strong-willed personality. Adam Garcia plays Violet's love interest, and gives enough charm and wit to make his character interesting and likable. John Goodman is here as Violet's father, and has some pretty good moments. Preferably at the end. The Coyote girls were all excellent in their parts. Even though they were sort of stereotyped nothing ever fell out of place. And don't think that Tyra Banks has a big part here. Her onscreen time is probably less than 10 minutes.

So was &quot;El Dorado.&quot; &quot;Shall I send over the script?&quot; asked Hawks. &quot;Why bother?&quot; asked the Duke. &quot;I've already been in it twice.&quot;Does Jerry Bruckheimer have the same nagging feeling of deja vu as he compares each new screenplay to those that have gone before? I wonder if he suspects his movie may not be original, as he contemplates a story about a girl from New Jersey who dreams of being a songwriter, moves to Manhattan, meets a guy, gets a job and has a heart-rending reconciliation with her dad, all in a movie that ends (yes, it really does) with the final line, &quot;What do you do when you realize all your dreams have come true?&quot;Bruckheimer and his director bring superb technical credits to this wheezy old story, and they add wall-to-wall music to make it sound like fun. But you can pump up the volume only so far before it becomes noise. I don't ask for startling originality in a movie like &quot;Coyote Ugly.&quot; I don't object to the scene in which the heroine and her guy neck in a convertible and regard the lights on a Manhattan bridge. I am not even surprised that the hero drives a classic car (no characters in Bruckheimer movies drive cars less than 25 years old unless they are parents or gangsters). I don't even mind the obligatory line, &quot;It's payback time!&quot; All I ask is that I be surprised a couple of times. Give me something I can't see coming and make it more unexpected than a beloved character getting hit by a car instead of having a heart attack.In the movie, Perabo, who has big-time star power, plays Violet, a working-class girl from South Amboy, N.J., who packs up and moves to a cheap apartment in Chinatown (where she meets not a single Chinese person) and gets a job in Coyote Ugly, a bar that would be the result if you took the bar in &quot;Cocktail&quot; and performed reckless experiments on its DNA.It's the kind of bar you would fight to get out of--and you'd have to. Customers are jammed so tightly together, the fire marshal can barely wedge his way into the room. They are offered no mixed drinks, no wine, just &quot;Jim, Jack, Johnny Red, Johnny Black and Jose--all my favorite friends,&quot; according to Lil (Maria Bello), the sexy blond who owns the club. &quot;You can have it any way you want it, as long as it's in a shot glass.&quot;Violet auditions for her job, which consists of dancing on top of the bar, pouring drinks, dumping ice on customers who get into fights and spraying the others every so often with the soda gun. These are skilled dancers. They can do Broadway routines on a slippery bar top, while drunks grab at their ankles. Every once in a while, just for variety, they pour booze on the bar and set it on fire.Many of the movie's shots are high-angle, looking down at the customers, their mouths upturned and gulping like gasping fish. Illuminated by garish neon, they bear an uncanny resemblance to Hieronymus Bosch's paintings of the damned roasting in hell.After a shaky start, Violet becomes a hit at the bar; meanwhile, she tries to place tapes of her songs around town. She has stage fright, you see, and can't sing her own songs because she's afraid to sing in front of an audience, although she will obviously do almost anything else.She meets Kevin (Adam Garcia), an awfully nice Australian short-order cook who encourages her, and even bribes a guy to give her an audition by trading his precious Spider-Man comic. They would no doubt have steamy sex, except that Bruckheimer, a student of straws in the wind, knows this is the summer when PG-13, not his old favorite R, is the coveted rating. (His &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; was also PG-13, which may explain why Angelina Jolie was missing from most of the film.)&quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; finally leads up to the questions: (1) Does she find the courage to sing? (2) Do they stay together after their Idiot Plot Misunderstanding? and (3) Do all of her dreams come true?There is a reason to see the movie, and that reason is Piper Perabo, who I first noticed in &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,&quot; writing that she was &quot;so fetching she sort of stops the clock.&quot; She has one of those friendly Julia Roberts smiles, good comic timing, ease and confidence on the screen, and a career ahead of her in movies better than this one. Lots better.",4,Have You Been To Coyote Ugly?,990748800,"05 25, 2001",2001,5266,"['Coyote', 'Ugly', 'quot', 'cliff-hanger', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'ventures', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'production', 'more',

From the commercials, you'd think you're going to see a movie about a bar with outrageous female bartenders. The movie is actually about Violet who moves from Jersey to New York to become a song writer. After a burglary, she's broke and gets a job at the bar Coyote Ugly. You get occasional glimpses at the girls dancing on the bar and flinging water, drinks, and ice on their customers. Other than Violet, the other women at the bar aren't featured. You learn nothing about them. And if you're a Tyra Banks fan, don't bother watching this movie. She's on screen about ten minutes. That's a generous estimate.

564562,A16X61RLY1YJL7,B0000524E5,"K. Wyatt ""ssintrepid""","[15, 24]","""Coyote Ugly"" is an interesting movie that falls more into the lines of a teenager type love story than what I had originally thought it would be.  Billed as an ""intoxicating sexy comedy"" from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, this movie more or less falls short of that billing in that it relies more heavily on the ""girl with a long shot makes it big"" theme that has been highly prevalent in previous movies, leaving one with the overwhelming impression of been there, seen that.Performance wise; stars such as Piper Parabo, John Goodman and Maria Bello all do a great job with the script they had.  I'm more or less surprised that Maria Bello hasn't become a bigger star as she definitely has it in her and she's an incredibly beautiful woman.This is the only movie from director David McNally II that I've seen so far and it would be hard to make a definitive judgment on his movie making talents based on this one movie that I didn't find particularly wonderful.  Hopefully down the road he'll find a better script to work with.The Premise:As stated above, this is a teenager type movie about Violet (Piper Parabo) who moves from rural New York to the Big Apple to make it big as a song writer.  Along the way she encounters the standard fare of difficulties of trying to get into that business and finds that she must take on a job at a bar known as the ""Coyote Ugly"" to try to make ends meet until she can get that ""one big break.""Overall, I'd say this is an interesting rental more than anything else.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:-Additional Scenes Not Seen In Theaters-Behind The Scenes Featurettes*Coyote 101*How To Be A Coyote*Inside The Songs*Search For The Stars-LeAnn Rimes Music Video-Audio Commentary With Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Director David McNally And The Coyotes-""Action Overload"" Reel Featuring the Hottest Moments From The Movie - Music Video-Style",3,Coyote Ugly - An interesting movie for teens!,1086393600,"06 5, 2004",2004,1872,"['Coyote', 'Ugly', 'interesting', 'movie', 'more', 'lines', 'teenager', 'type', 'story', 'what', 'had', 'originally', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'Billed', 'intoxicating', 'sexy', 'comedy', 'producer', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'movie', 'more', 'less', 'falls', 'short', 'billing', 'more', 'heavily', 'girl', 'long', 'shot', 'big', 'theme', 'been', 'highly', 'prevalent', 'previous', 'movies', 'leaving', 'one', 'overwhelming', 'impression', 'been', 'seen', 'that.Performance', 'wise', 'stars', 'such', 'Piper', 'Parabo', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'all', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'script', 'had', ""'m"", 'more', 'less', 'surprised', 'Maria', 'Bello', ""n't"", 'become', 'bigger', 'star', 'definitely', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'woman.This', 'only', 'movie', 'director', 'David', 'McNally', 'II', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'make', 'definitive', 'judgment', 'movie', 'making', 'talents', 'based', 'one', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'particularly', 'wonderful', 'Hopefully', 'road', ""'ll"", 'find', 'better', 'script', 'work', 'with.The', 'Premise', 'stated', 'teenager', 'type', 'movie', 'Violet', 'Piper', 'Parabo', 'who', 'rural', 'New', 'York', 'Big', 'Apple', 'make', 'big', 'song', 'writer', 'way', 'standard', 'fare', 'difficulties', 'trying', 'get', 'business', 'must', 'take', 'job', 'bar', 'known', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'try', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'can', 'get', 'one', 'big', 'break', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'say', 'interesting', 'rental', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', '-Additional', 'Scenes', 'Not', 'Seen', 'Theaters-Behind', 'Scenes', 'Featurettes*Coyote', '101*How', 'Be', 'A', 'Coyote*Inside', 'Songs*Search', 'Stars-LeAnn', 'Rimes', 'Music', 'Video-Audio', 'Commentary', 'Producer', 'Jerry', 'Bruckheimer', 'Director', 'David', 'McNally', 'Coyotes-', 'Action', 'Overload', 'Reel', 'Featuring', 'Hottest', 'Moments', 'Movie', 'Music', 'Video-Style']",Coyote Ugly

But so what?

This is one of those movies.  I will say that, despite the multiple female bodies on display (in minimal clothing, but always clothed), this strikes me as more of a girl movie than a guy movie.

564564,A2NQUGGYM0DBM1,B0000524E5,L.A. Scene,"[2, 3]","The motion picture ""Coyote Ugly"" is a story that takes place in the world famous ""Coyote Ugly"" saloon in New York City.  The ""Coyote Ugly"" saloon rose to fame in the 1990s.  The saloon was the brainchild of Liliana ""Lil"" Lovell.  The thing that distinguishes this saloon from many others is that ""Coyote Ugly"" features female bartenders dancing on the bar that often will challenge customers to drinking contests while performing outrageous antics.  ""Coyote Ugly"" first rose to fame in 1997 when ""Gentlemen's Quarterly"" magazine published the experiences as told by a former ""Coyote Ugly"" barmaid named Elizabeth Gilbert.  The publicity of this article along with the success of the New York bar would soon lead to the movie ""Coyote Ugly"".  This movie basically is a movie that is set in a Hollywood version of the bar.  While this movie will entertain the audience, it can't seem to overcome a weak storyline.One thing that I was immediately disappointed with is that ""Coyote Ugly"" isn't the story on how Lovell formed the ""Coyote Ugly"" saloon (which I think could have been the basis for an interesting story).  Instead, producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson along with writer Gina Wenkos tell the story of an shy aspiring songwriter Violet Sanford (played by Piper Perabo) from South Amboy, New Jersey who leaves behind her father (played by John Goodman, who delivers one of his best performances) and a job at a local Pizza Parlor to pursue a songwriting career in New York City.  When Violet arrives in New York, she realizes that breaking into the music business isn't all that it is cracked up to be.  Desperate for work, Violet hears about an opening at the ""Coyote Ugly"" bar.  Violet goes to meet Lil Lovell (played by Maria Bello) who sees something in Violet and decides to give her an audition.  After some rough goes, Lil eventually hires Violet on a regular basis.  The shy Violet will at first be uncomfortable with the aggressive nature of the bar, but will soon grow into the role while keeping it a secret from her father  At the same time, Violet develops a relationship with Kevin O'Donnell (played by Adam Garcia) who convinces Violet to overcome her remaining shyness and sing her songs herself.  Eventually, her job at Coyote Ugly, her quest to try to sing her songs, the relationship with Kevin, and her relationship with her father will all reach a head.One of the main reasons why Coyote Ugly will entertain is because of the dancing and the soundtrack.  The dance scenes in the bar are spectacular.  Although the bar scenes are exaggerated from what actually goes on in the saloon. they are going to entertain you.  Director David McNally does a sensational job at putting integrating music throughout the movie - whether it is a bar scene or not.  While this film did spawn two soundtrack albums (""Coyote Ugly"" and ""More Music from Coyote Ugly""), it is worth noting that there are a few songs in the movie not found on the soundtracks (most notably, Def Leppard's ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"").  The music and dancing come together perfectly when the Coyote Dancers perform The Charlie Daniels Band's ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"".The movie has two noteworthy performances.  John Goodman is the perfect person to play Bill Sanford - Violet's father.  He brings the perfect balance of humor and sensitivity that is needed for the role.  While I am not a Goodman fan, I really enjoyed his performance.  The other standout performance is delivered by rising star Bridget Moynahan who plays the Rachel - a dancer with attitude who will give Violet a hard time at working at the bar.  Playing this kind of a role was something new to Moynahan and she pulls it off flawlessly.Unfortunately the story just isn't that strong to support the music or the performances of Goodman and Moynahan.  The weak storyline is seen throughout the movie, but probably is best illustrated in the scenes where Violet first goes to work at the bar.  To me, the story doesn't do a good job at convincing me how Lil Lovell sees something in the shy Violet Sanford that she hires her for an audition and then give her several chances to secure a job at the bar.  I didn't like the way that Violet overcame her early struggles in working at the bar - it seemed too scripted to me.  In general, the ""Coyote Ugly"" bar serves as a backdrop for the story of the movie - but I would have preferred the movie to revolve more around the bar and the Coyote dancers that worked there.  Namely, they could have done so much more to develop the character of Rachel as well as a lesser-extent Lil and another dancer named Cammie.Perhaps one of the big letdowns of the movie is Adam Garcia.  Garcia is famous for his outstanding portrayal of Tony Manero in the London stage version of ""Saturday Night Fever"".  Garcia is someone who has shown real talent.  Although Garcia doesn't do a bad job in the movie, the film doesn't do a good job at utilizing his talents (for example there is only one big dance scene with Garcia).  I would have liked to see Garcia have more interactions with some of the other characters - for example, interactions with Violet's overprotective father would have been very interesting.It is worth noting that Supermodel Tyra Banks and singer Leann Rimes have cameo roles in this movie.Overall the movie will entertain - especially from a musical standpoint and a comedic standpoint.  The ending is actually pretty good as well.  However, the shortcomings of the storyline are going to be too much to overcome.  You may be a bit disappointed if you have been to the ""Coyote Ugly"" saloon.  This might not be a movie you watch over and over, but it is still worth checking out.",3,"While this movie does entertain, it does have a weak storyline",1124064000,"08 15,

I wanted to see it, but I never got around to watching it. 13 years later, I purchased the DVD. I don't regret my decision. Like many people said, the movie is basically an excuse to show hot women in tight leather pants- and there's nothing wrong with that. The plot is very predictable. I won't summarize the entire plot, but it has every lame clich&eacute;- the shy girl who goes to the city to try to make it as a performer but has to settle for a humiliating job, the boss who starts off as abusive but eventually befriends her, the father who at first disapproves of her career choice but then supports her in the end. They also made the trite fat jokes about John Goodman.Despite the flaws of this movie, it is entertaining. The unrated version features a hot sex scene. I enjoyed watching Tyra Banks shaking her booty. The songs in the movie were pretty good. I loved Leann Rimes' performance. And since the movie was made in 2000, the World Trade Center was still standing. It is featured prominently throughout the movie. I recommend this movie.

564572,A15TIGL6MKUWYU,B0000524E5,"Mark E. Summers ""Gamekrazy""","[0, 0]","Coyote Ugly brings absolutely nothing new to the table, but taking the movie at its own merit, it's not actually all that bad.  The plotline in a nutshell, Violet moves to New York to make it as a songwriter, not knowing that it's not as easy as just going to a record company and giving them a demo tape(is anyone really that nave), and ends up working at a bar called Coyote Ugly to make money until she can sell her songs.  That's it, except for the standard romantic interest, and the fact that the women at Coyote Ugly don't only pour drinks, they dance on the bar, spray down the customers with booze and water, and are full of attitude.The problem for Violet is that the only way to get her songs heard is to sing them herself at open mic nights at clubs. Unfortunately for her, she's too afraid to sing her own songs in public.  She's not too afraid to sing along with the jukebox at Coyote Ugly, or dance on top of the bar for a bunch of leering men, but I guess that's just a different story.  How, I really couldn't see, but it is, or so we're told.  Yeah, I'm still shaking my head over that one myself.For those of you who are interested in flesh, I have to disappoint you and let you know that this movie is PG-13 so you won't be seeing any nudity here.  In fact, the only person who takes their top off dancing on the bar is Violet's love interest, who does a dance on the bar while she's auctioning him off to the highest bidder to try to make up the $250 she needs to give to Lil, the bars owner, for dousing down the fire marshall with water, causing them to get a fine.  The $250 is what she needs to raise to pay the fine so she doesn't get fired.  Who ever said a movie really had to make sense?Still though, the girls are all good looking, and they do have some good moves, and I felt fairly entertained, at least after the first twenty minutes which were kind of slow and boring.  The plot isn't hard to follow, as you've probably seen it dozens of times before, from the inevitable misundertanding that leads to Violet's and Kevin's break up, down to the ending, where Violet still doesn't know whether or not she can sing her songs in front of other people until Kevin shows up to save the day.So no, you won't see anything new here, but the story isn't offensive on its own, and there are some funny moments, and some good looking women, so it's not a total bust either.  Try it out for yourself, it's good for at least one viewing.",3,Standard formula makes for an ok movie,980380800,"01 25, 2001",2001,2458,"['Coyote', 'Ugly', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'new', 'table', 'taking', 'movie', 'own', 'merit', 'not', 'actually', 'bad', 'plotline', 'nutshell', 'Violet', 'New', 'York', 'make', 'songwriter', 'not', 'knowing', 'not', 'as', 'easy', 'just', 'going', 'record', 'company', 'giving', 'demo', 'tape', 'anyone', 'really', 'nave', 'up', 'working', 'bar', 'called', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'make', 'money', 'can', 'sell', 'songs', 'standard', 'romantic', 'interest', 'fact', 'women', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'do', ""n't"", 'only', 'pour', 'drinks', 'dance', 'bar', 'spray', 'down', 'customers', 'booze', 'water', 'are', 'full', 'attitude.The', 'problem', 'Violet', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'songs', 'heard', 'sing', 'open', 'mic', 'nights', 'clubs', 'Unfortunately', 'too', 'afraid', 'sing', 'own', 'songs', 'public', 'not', 'too', 'afraid', 'sing', 'along', 'jukebox', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'dance', 'top', 'bar', 'bunch', 'leering', 'men', 'guess', 'just', 'different', 'story', 'How', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'so', ""'re"", 'told', 'Yeah', ""'m"", 'still', 'shaking', 'head', 'one', 'myself.For', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'flesh', 'have', 'disappoint', 'let', 'know', 'movie', 'PG-13', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'seeing', 'nudity', 'here', 'fact', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'top', 'off', 'dancing', 'bar', 'Violet', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'dance', 'bar', 'auctioning', 'highest', 'bidder', 'try', 'make', 'up', '250', 'give', 'Lil', 'bars', 'owner', 'dousing', 'down', 'fire', 'marshall', 'water', 'causing', 'get', 'fine', '250', 'what', 'raise', 'pay', 'fine', ""n't"", 'get', 'fired', 'Who', 'ever', 'said', 'movie', 'really', 'had', 'make', 'sense', 'Still', 'girls', 'are', 'good', 'looking', 'do', 'have', 'good', 'moves', 'felt', 'fairly', 'entertained', 'least', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'were', 'kind', 'slow', 'boring', 'plot', ""n't"", 'hard', 'follow', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'times', 'inevitable', 'misundertanding', 'Violet', 'Kevin', 'break', 'up', 'down', 'ending', 'where', 'Violet', 'still', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'can', 'sing', 'songs', 'front', 'other', 'people', 'Kevin', 'up', 'save', 'day.So', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'new', 'here', 'story', ""n't"", 'offensive', 'own', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'good', 'looking', 'women', 'not', 'total', 'bust', 'Try', 'out', 'good', 'least', 'one', 'viewing']",Coyote Ugly
564573,A1XWMRORNEC0IY,B0000524E5,Martha Moore,"[2, 2]","Coyote Ugly is a weak movie in some ways.  The plot is very simple and also very unoriginal.  Violet, a young woman, leaves home, without the approval of her overprotective, widowed father, and goes to New York to pursue a songwriting career and try to make it on her own.  To make ends meet in the meantime, she takes a job as a barmaid. She meets a guy who becomes her love interest.  This whole plot could be summed in 30 minutes or less.  The thing that stretches out the movie and makes it fun to watch is the music (an awesome soundtrack) and the wild antics that go on at the bar where Violet works.Fact is, Coyote Ugly isn't your average, ordinary, everyday bar.  The barmaids dance on the bar, pour drinks on themselves and each other, spray customers with water,  and outrageously flirt with the male customers.  This is what makes the movie.I must say that much of the movie is unbelievable.  By some miracle, Violet manages to make it as a songwriter after singing one song in one club.  Also by some miracle, her father (charmingly played by John Goodman, I must add) does a total turnaround from sternly disapproving of her working in a bar to dancing on the bar himself.  Violet's problem with extreme stage fright is also unconvincing.

564576,A152C8GYY25HAH,B0000524E5,Matthew Horner,"[6, 8]","Many who watch Coyote Ugly will find themselves feeling the story is very familiar. There are some good reasons for that. One is that Jerry Bruckheimer, one of the most successful producers of all time, insists that his movies be done by the numbers. As a result, while most people in the business are envious of his financial success, you'll rarely find him grabbing awards on Oscar night. Mr. Bruckheimer is also a firm believer in recycling. Sixteen years ago, he produced a big hit called Flashdance, in which a determined and beautiful girl worked as a dancer in a fancy bar until she was able to become a dancer in the theater. In Coyote Ugly a girl so similar as to be a clone works as a dancer and bartender in a huge bar until she can make it as a songwriter. In both movies, the girl is mentored into stardom by a handsome young man because, I suppose, we are still saddled by the odd notion that, not only can a woman not make it without a man, she has to sleep with him, too. I am certain that Mr. Bruckheimer would claim that the guy is still around to give a movie dramatic appeal, but I would argue that it says that the more things change, the more they remain the same in Hollywood.Violet Sanford [Piper Perabo] moves to New York City from New Jersey. Dad [John Goodman] doesn't approve, but this being a by the numbers movie, we all know from the start that he'll come around. In New York, Violet takes cassettes of her songs around to the big music companies. They virtually throw her out on her ear. One night a tape winds up in the hands of a charming cook named Kevin [Adam Garcia], and he realizes what we know even though we haven't yet heard the songs: Violet is a super talented writer. Meanwhile, she lands a job at a bar called Coyote Ugly. In this establishment premium liquor is sold in shot glasses. That's all they sell. When the girls aren't too busy pouring shots or spraying customers who ask for water in the face with the same, they get up on the bar and dance. The crowd goes wild. This is the kind of place that only exists in a movie.Coyote Ugly has in its favor a very high energy level and a very pretty cast. It has a great many familiar songs, mostly from the 80s, in it, thus assuring brisk soundtrack sales. Its original songs, unfortunately, are unlikely to still be being played in the 2020s. Perabo is a charming and talented actress, and better parts are bound to come her way. For her, this movie is merely a stepping stone.Bruckheimer is a pro at sniffing out the winds of change, and he knew that the summer of 2000 would be one in which the 'PG-13' rating would rule. This was not due to Hollywood's sudden taking of the moral high ground. It was due to saber rattling coming from Washington and to the fact that Hollywood's core audience is now so young that many of its member aren't supposed to be able to buy tickets to 'R' rated fare.

Don't watch it with your hopes high. It's predictable, and you were laying out the plot before it was happening. Of course she's going to lose the job because of stupid Adam Garcia; of course something's going to happen to her Dad AFTER they have fallen out and she decides to come back and live in her hometown; there will be a big situation in the bar, which she defuses (by singing?!); and of course, she &amp; Adam Garcia will live happily ever after.I think if the film had been based more in the bar, then it would have been slightly better, but then it ran the chance of being boring, and too repetitive.

The bar is not even important for the main character in her search for love and success. She met her boyfriend before she even went to the bar, and she got strength to perform from her dad, not from those karaoke nights at the Coyote Ugly. We don't see her in a close friendship with the rest of the coyotes. The bar doesn't fulfill any function here.It's useless as a comedy, as a drama, it's not enough when it comes to sex and those amazing girls. You might think that having those bodies and those faces, it would help the weak storyline. But if you're only looking for sexy women... well, these are HOT, but they never get naked, they really don't show much. If that was the high poing of the movie, it didn't work out.But I want to make myself clear: I don't think a movie is good just because there's explicit sex or nudity.

That doesn't mean to say that this film isn't full of the usual clich&eacute;s - cute virginal girl lost in the big city finds her own sexuality and individuality among others.Still, it's fun.  For one, it's quite blatant without being in the least bit taboo.  Our heroine finds work in a bar, finding that travelling to New York to sell songs isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Initial clumsiness turns to refined solidarity with the other girls that work there and she finds a nice boy who understands her plight.With the cringe-making story you may think that there's nothing good here.  You'd be wrong.  There are some great performances from John Goodman and Melanie Lynskey (of 'Heavenly Creatures' fame - give her more roles!) and great characters like the sassy owner of the bar.  There's some nice throwaway comedy lines and the songs that the girl writes are good but believably unrefined - most are sung solo by her on her keyboard.  The nice thing about it is that it's sweet without ever ramming it down your throat and you can sit back and relax knowing that everything's going to work out right in the end.

He finally agrees to bankroll the project on the condition that she turns over all actual production decisions to a competent production company. The production group casts a pair of likable actors and get John Goodman to play a supporting role. They target the Britney segment of the Lifetime movie audience with a teen angst/struggling artist story-line. They also go after a large secondary audience-those (of both sexes) who like to watch hot women in tight pants. They have a large enough budget to staff the project with an excellent crew although they skimp on production design, supporting cast talent, and editing. They make a movie called Coyote Ugly and successfully market it to their target audiences. If you are part of their secondary target audience it is best to watch it on DVD so you can avoid any scenes devoid of tight pants.Problem--Nothing happens. This story is so tired only the worn down father of the screenwriter would dream of making it into a movie, and just on the long shot that his daughter would move out of the house and get a real job once she had a writing credit on her resume.

564598,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B0000524E5,Reviewer,"[22, 28]","A talented young woman from New Jersey, filled with hope and desire, moves to New York to chase her dreams of becoming a songwriter in ""Coyote Ugly,""  directed by David McNally and starring Piper Perabo.  Against the wishes of  her father, Bill (John Goodman), but with his acquiescent approval, Violet  (Perabo) begins her quest and soon learns what every aspiring newcomer to  show business discovers:  It's tough out there.  Soon, in order to pay the  rent and keep the dream alive, on a tip she seeks employment in a bar  called Coyote Ugly; the owner, Lil (Maria Bello) lets her ""audition (work  one night)"" to see if she can handle their kind of action.  It's a tough  gig, but Violet knows she's going to have to make certain sacrifices if  she's to succeed.  And that is really what this movie is all about:  Personal character, having the tenacity to maintain ideals and dignity, and  deciding what and how much one must be willing to sacrifice to achieve  one's goals; and most importantly, having enough heart to see it all  through.  Perabo gives a winning performance as Violet; she's fresh,  somewhat naive (but not entirely), and the way she presents her character  makes it easy to connect with her right away.  She becomes someone you care  about quickly, and there are moments early on, especially when she first  arrives in New York, that allow you to emphasize with her immediately.  There's a fragility about her, but at the same time she exhibits a strength  of character and sense of morality that is becoming; and being able to  convey this level of complexity convincingly is a tribute to her ability as  an actress.  John Goodman also does a good job as her father, a caring bear  of a man who obviously has nothing but the best intentions for his daughter  at heart.  His performance, and the way the situation of his having to let  Violet go is handled makes it believable, and helps create an emotional  bond between them and the audience.  It's something with which many will be  able to identify, and it becomes one of the underlying strengths of the  film.  One of the weaknesses of this project comes, not from the  movie itself, but from the ""promotion"" of the movie; in this case the  theatrical trailer, which is a gross misrepresentation of what ""Coyote  Ugly"" really is.  Certainly the ""coyotes"" and the bar are a significant  part of the film, and it's all exceptionally well and tastefully done, and  is a fun part of the movie and definitely gives it some life; but I think  the presentation in the trailer will do more to alienate a cross-section of  audience that ultimately would appreciate this movie, but initially at  least will not even see it, and only because of a misconception caused by  the preview.  It must be noted that this is a PG-13; there is nary a  profane word, and no sex or nudity in it.  It is an upbeat, entertaining  film that should be readily embraced by a much wider audience than one  would expect simply from seeing the trailer.  The excellent supporting cast  includes Adam Garcia (Kevin), Izabella Miko (Cammie), Melanie Lynskey  (Gloria), Bridget Moynahan (Rachel), Tyra Banks (Zoe) and LeAnn Rimes (In a  cameo as herself).  Hopefully, if only by word-of-mouth, this movie will  gain the audience it deserves.  Reminiscent of ""Flashdance,"" there is a  universal theme here of having a dream and going for it.  In the final  analysis, ""Coyote Ugly"" is a decent film that will appeal to anyone who's  ever had or pursued a dream.  Do yourself a favor, put any preconceived  notions aside and check this one out; I think you'll be glad you did.",3,So Much More Than The Preview,966988800,"08 23, 2000",2000,3617,"['talented', 'young', 'woman', 'New', 'Jersey', 'filled', 'hope', 'desire', 'moves', 'New', 'York', 'chase', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'songwriter', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'directed', 'David', 'McNally', 'starring', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'wishes', 'father', 'Bill', 'John', 'Goodman', 'acquiescent', 'approval', 'Violet', 'Perabo', 'quest', 'soon', 'learns', 'what', 'aspiring', 'newcomer', 'show', 'business', 'discovers', 'tough', 'there', 'Soon', 'order', 'pay', 'rent', 'keep', 'dream', 'alive', 'tip', 'employment', 'bar', 'called', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'owner', 'Lil', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'audition', 'work', 'one', 'night', 'see', 'can', 'handle', 'kind', 'action', 'tough', 'gig', 'Violet', 'going', 'have', 'make', 'certain', 'sacrifices', 'succeed', 'really', 'what', 'movie', 'Personal', 'character', 'having', 'tenacity', 'maintain', 'ideals', 'dignity', 'deciding', 'what', 'how', 'much', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'achieve', 'one', 'goals', 'most', 'importantly', 'having', 'enough', 'heart', 'see', 'Perabo', 'winning', 'performance', 'Violet', 'fresh', 'somewhat', 'naive', 'not', 'entirely', 'way', 'character', 'easy', 'connect', 'right', 'away', 'someone', 'care', 'quickly', 'are', 'moments', 'early', 'especially', 'when', 'first', 'New', 'York', 'allow', 'emphasize', 'immediately', 'fragility', 'same', 'time', 'strength', 'character', 'sense', 'morality', 'becoming', 'being', 'able', 'convey', 'level', 'complexity', 'convincingly', 'tribute', 'ability', 'actress', 'John', 'Goodman', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'father', 'caring', 'bear', 'man', 'who', 'obviously', 'nothing', 'best', 'intentions', 'daughter', 'heart', 'performance', 'way', 'situation', 'having', 'let', 'Violet', 'go', 'handled', 'believable', 'create', 'emotional', 'bond', 'audience', 'something', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'one', 'underlying', 'strengths', 'film', 'One', 'weaknesses', 'project', 'not', 'movie', 'promotion', 'movie', 'case', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'gross', 'misrepresentation', 'what', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'really', 'Certainly', 'coyotes', 'bar', 'are', 'significant', 'part', 'film', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'tastefully', 'done', 'fun', 'part', 'movie', 'definitely', 'life', 'think', 'presentation', 'trailer', 'will', 'do', 'more', 'alienate', 'cross-section', 'audience', 'ultimately', 'would', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'initially', 'least', 'will', 'not', 'even', 'see', 'only', 'misconception', 'caused', 'preview', 'must', 'be', 'noted', 'PG-13', 'nary', 'profane', 'word', 'sex', 'nudity', 'upbeat', 'entertaining', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'readily', 'embraced', 'much', 'wider', 'audience', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'simply', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Adam', 'Garcia', 'Kevin', 'Izabella', 'Miko', 'Cammie', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'Gloria', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'Rachel', 'Tyra', 'Banks', 'Zoe', 'LeAnn', 'Rimes', 'cameo', 'herself', 'Hopefully', 'only', 'word-of-mouth', 'movie', 'will', 'gain', 'audience', 'Reminiscent', 'Flashdance', 'universal', 'theme', 'here', 'having', 'dream', 'going', 'final', 'analysis', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'decent', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'pursued', 'dream', 'Do', 'favor', 'put', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'aside', 'check', 'one', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",Coyote Ugly

She wants to be a song writer you see and New York is the place to be. She soon finds out that the music game is ever so much more difficult than she dreamed. In order to make ends meet, she wins a job as a performing waitress at the very hip club Coyote Ugly. There the nights are hot and the bar maids even hotter. Violet meets a nice guy who tries to help he overcome the stage fright that is preventing her from showcasing her songs on stage. As she falls into a grove at Coyote Ugly is starts to look like she will never make it as a song writer.My Opinion: I loved the bar scenes. That's where the 4 stars come from. I like the scenes with the Coyotes in them. They were the most interesting and the most fun. The rest of the story was cute, but what I really wanted was more of the Coyote Ugly. That was what was fun. I didn't really need another &quot;little girl makes it in the big city&quot; story. I did enjoy Kevin O'Donnell and his character. It was nice to see a good guy getting the girl for a change. I'm sick of the jerks that are mean to the girls and the girls who want them more because of it. John Goodman was great as the father struggling to be on his own. Maria Bello has been one of my favorites for a long time and she doesn't let us down here. I only wish she could have been the main character and we could have also seen into the lives of each of the Coyotes. Even though I wished for more of the bar, I was thoroughly entertained and enjoyed every minute of the movie. I ate up the deleted scenes that rounded out the story and filled in the holes. I will definitely be looking for a good deal on a used copy of this DVD to add to my collection.DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 the best! Video quality is great!  Sound: DD5.1 with great music  Extras: There are plenty of extras. The deleted scenes show why we shouldn't have been surprised when Gloria got married. They also show people taunting Violet with predictions that she will fail. They help fill out the plot. Also included are the trailers, documentaries, and music video.  Menus: The menus are ok. Nothing to write home about.What You Should Do:  Rent it unless you can get a good deal on a previously viewed copy. It's a guilty pleasure type movie, but the price for a new copy is too high.Related Movies To Check Out: Road House, Flashdance, Cocktail, Doc Hollywood",4,Lil Looks Like Your New Girl Can't Hack It,1001980800,"10 2, 2001",2001,2489,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'Violet', 'Sanford', 'small', 'New', 'Jersey', 'home', 'as', 'well', 'father', 'moves', 'Big', 'Apple', 'be', 'song', 'writer', 'see', 'New', 'York', 'place', 'be', 'soon', 'out', 'music', 'game', 'ever', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'dreamed', 'order', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'job', 'performing', 'waitress', 'very', 'hip', 'club', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'nights', 'are', 'hot', 'bar', 'maids', 'even', 'hotter', 'Violet', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'help', 'overcome', 'stage', 'fright', 'preventing', 'showcasing', 'songs', 'stage', 'grove', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'look', 'will', 'never', 'make', 'song', 'writer.My', 'Opinion', 'loved', 'bar', 'scenes', 'where', '4', 'stars', 'come', 'scenes', 'Coyotes', 'were', 'most', 'interesting', 'most', 'fun', 'rest', 'story', 'was', 'cute', 'what', 'really', 'wanted', 'was', 'more', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'fun', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'quot', 'little', 'girl', 'big', 'city', 'quot', 'story', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Kevin', ""O'Donnell"", 'character', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'good', 'guy', 'getting', 'girl', 'change', ""'m"", 'sick', 'jerks', 'are', 'mean', 'girls', 'girls', 'who', 'want', 'more', 'John', 'Goodman', 'was', 'great', 'father', 'struggling', 'be', 'own', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'been', 'one', 'favorites', 'long', 'time', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'here', 'only', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'main', 'character', 'could', 'have', 'also', 'seen', 'lives', 'Coyotes', 'Even', 'wished', 'more', 'bar', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'enjoyed', 'minute', 'movie', 'ate', 'up', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'rounded', 'out', 'story', 'filled', 'holes', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'looking', 'good', 'deal', 'used', 'copy', 'DVD', 'add', 'collection.DVD', 'Quality', 'Video', 'Widescreen', 'Anamorphic', '1.85:1', 'best', 'Video', 'quality', 'great', 'Sound', 'DD5.1', 'great', 'music', 'Extras', 'are', 'plenty', 'extras', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'show', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'surprised', 'when', 'Gloria', 'got', 'married', 'also', 'show', 'people', 'taunting', 'Violet', 'predictions', 'will', 'fail', 'help', 'fill', 'out', 'plot', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'trailers', 'documentaries', 'music', 'video', 'menus', 'are', 'ok', 'Nothing', 'write', 'home', 'Should', 'Do', 'Rent', 'can', 'get', 'good', 'deal', 'previously', 'viewed', 'copy', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'type', 'movie', 'price', 'new', 'copy', 'too', 'high.Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Road', 'House', 'Flashdance', 'Cocktail', 'Doc', 'Hollywood']",Coyote Ugly

564612,A3SQZCA0JFB5CV,B0000524E5,S Martin,"[11, 14]","The previews of Coyote Ugly looked pretty good, so I went out and rented the DVD.  The movie turned out to be pretty good, as long as you let your brain take a rest.The storyline of the movie seems pretty basic: young girl goes to New York to make it big as a songwriter, and ends up working in a bar to make ends meet.  The bar isn't just any bar though, it's Coyote Ugly, where the barmaids dance on top of the bar and hose down anyone asking for water. Eventually she finds herself a sexy Australian boyfriend and gets the chance to perform her song.The movie is actually pretty entertaining, Piper Perabo makes an excellent Violet, and John Goodman is good as her father.  Coyote Ugly makes me wish there were bars where I lived like that; I'd have a reason to go to one if there were.  The soundtrack has a lot of upbeat music, which helps the movie keep its upbeat feel.I found two disappointments in the movie, the first being that Piper Perabo doesn't sing in the movie; Leanne Rhimes does all the singing. I was hoping Perabo would sing, as there don't seem to be a lot of actors that sing and act anymore.The second disappointment was the lack of character development in everyone but Violet and her father.  They're fairly well developed, you know about how Violet grew up, and how he father acts towards her, but the other barmaids, the boyfriend, and the owner of the bar seem one dimensional.  You know that the barmaid that's leaving (Tyra Banks) is going to law school, one barmaid has problems with anger management, and the other one is a blond tease. That's about it though, and the owner isn't any better. She only keeps things in the bar that she drinks, and if you have the DVD and watch the deleted scenes, you find out how she got the bar.  The boyfriend (Adam Garcia) is probably the third best developed character in the movie, but they don't really develop him until near the end.All in all, Coyote Ugly is a good movie to watch, as long as you're not the type to pick apart movies.  It doesn't have a heavy plot, and there's enough eye candy for both sexes to make the movie worth watching for most people.",3,Decent Movie if you don't think too hard,989107200,"05 6, 2001",2001,2134,"['previews', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'went', 'out', 'rented', 'DVD', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'long', 'let', 'brain', 'take', 'rest.The', 'storyline', 'movie', 'pretty', 'basic', 'young', 'girl', 'New', 'York', 'make', 'big', 'songwriter', 'up', 'working', 'bar', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'bar', ""n't"", 'just', 'bar', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'where', 'barmaids', 'dance', 'top', 'bar', 'hose', 'down', 'anyone', 'asking', 'water', 'Eventually', 'sexy', 'Australian', 'boyfriend', 'chance', 'perform', 'song.The', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'excellent', 'Violet', 'John', 'Goodman', 'good', 'father', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'wish', 'were', 'bars', 'where', 'lived', ""'d"", 'have', 'reason', 'go', 'one', 'were', 'soundtrack', 'lot', 'upbeat', 'music', 'movie', 'keep', 'upbeat', 'feel.I', 'found', 'two', 'disappointments', 'movie', 'first', 'being', 'Piper', 'Perabo', ""n't"", 'sing', 'movie', 'Leanne', 'Rhimes', 'singing', 'was', 'hoping', 'Perabo', 'would', 'sing', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'lot', 'actors', 'sing', 'act', 'anymore.The', 'second', 'disappointment', 'was', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'everyone', 'Violet', 'father', ""'re"", 'fairly', 'well', 'developed', 'know', 'how', 'Violet', 'grew', 'up', 'how', 'other', 'barmaids', 'boyfriend', 'owner', 'bar', 'seem', 'one', 'dimensional', 'know', 'barmaid', 'leaving', 'Tyra', 'Banks', 'going', 'law', 'school', 'one', 'barmaid', 'problems', 'anger', 'management', 'other', 'one', 'blond', 'tease', 'owner', ""n't"", 'better', 'only', 'things', 'bar', 'have', 'DVD', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'got', 'bar', 'boyfriend', 'Adam', 'Garcia', 'probably', 'third', 'best', 'developed', 'character', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'develop', 'end.All', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'not', 'type', 'pick', 'apart', 'movies', ""n't"", 'have', 'heavy', 'plot', 'enough', 'eye', 'candy', 'sexes', 'make', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'most', 'people']",Coyote Ugly

Violet gets a job as a waitress in the real life bar the Coyote Ugly and it is there that she makes new friends, while showing the world how great a singer she is. LeAnn Rimes did the actual singing of the Violet character as Perabo's vocals were dubbed.

564630,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B0000524E5,wellwellwell,"[2, 3]","Although the cast list is comprised of mostly females, there are many aspects that allow `Coyote Ugly' to reveal itself as more than just another ""chick flick"".  The sex appeal that the movie possesses is reminiscent of a `Girls Gone Wild' video; but with a PG-13 twist.  Had the film been pushed to R, it's hard to say if it would've received more or less attention.  The women never really reveal anything.  And for the most part that's okay.  But as another reviewer noted, there is not enough Tyra Banks.  She's on the cover, in the movie for about 15 minutes, and then gone.  I guess in the end it doesn't really matter; but still, they shouldn't lead the viewer on.  When it comes to the actual storyline, a lot can (or cannot) be said.  If you're a male, the plot probably won`t affect you.  However, the female audience will surely be intrigued by the character of Jersey (first-timer Piper Perabo).The plot is based on that character; who is lost in life and needs something to help boost her music career.  She obviously has talent, but two things drag her down.  One... her father (John Goodman) doesn't want her to leave because he'd then have no one to wash his cloths.  Two... she has an enormous fear of being on stage.  With that being said, the movie just goes off those two aspects.  Jersey does find a job, but it's not your average profession.  The job title is said to be a bartender, but it could be explained as a singer/bartender/stripper/dancer.  As it's old hat with Jerry Bruckheimer films, it does a great job with the in-your-face sequences.  When the woman are dancing on the bar to oldies (or whatever), the camera work shoots back and forth very nicely.  And even though this movie seems like a `Charlie's Angles' without the action, it gives you a real charge.  Finding a bar like this is as far-fetched as the ending to `Armageddon' was (okay, not really).  It seems like the kind of bar people'd dream about.  Since I don't like to ruin movies for people, I will stop here.  There are a lot of interesting parts in this movie.  There's some good comedy; mostly courtesy of John Goodman.  I particularly enjoyed when someone honks their horn at him when he`s working.  I won't spoil that for you either.  But the acting by Perabo is rather average, but can be condoled since it's here first major role.  The role of Kevin (Adam Garcia) will certainly be enjoyable for the females, since he brings his own type of male sex appeal to the movie.  And the appearances by funnymen Johnny Knoxville and Chris Wylde are genuinely good cameos; though not as good as LeAnn Rimes playing herself.  The characters of most of the bartenders are not well-covered, but I think it was intended to be that way.  And the fact that Zoe (Tyra Banks) left to become a lawyer is smart; as it shows the women are not just brainless, low I.Q. bartenders.  Still, although most of the movie's aspects are covered, some of them are not covered too well.Whether you're a boy or a girl, there's great chance you'll enjoy `Coyote Ugly'.  If you like the female-fronted movies then there's no question you'll like this one.  If you're a male, and you're looking for hot, sensual movies with endless spraying of beer and close-to/would-be strippers, you'll probably enjoy it too.  I gave the movie 3 stars; I enjoyed it a lot, but as I've hinted to, was a little disappointed with it as a whole.  I give Bruckheimer and co. credit for doing a movie like this, though I don't feel it is quite as good as his other ""action"" movies.  This film is not a let-down because of its PG-13 rating, and it's certainly not just a ""chick flick"".

Piper Perabo is a very attractive songwriter looking to make it in the big city. My only problem is that isshe's from North Jersey. There goes that cliche again where anyone living up to 25 miles outside of Manhattan is moving to the big city. That's like moving from Independence Missouri to Kansas City. It's not that big of a deal especially when you grew up 25 miles away in South Amboy. People commute eveyday on NJ Transit. I'll get past that. (Bruckheimer) repeats a great Flashdance concepct however with too much sappy drama and impauseable messages. Piper needs a job so she makes it on the bar to dance at colt club Coyote Ugly (Hogs and Hefiers) to make ends meet where cute but silly drama take place. Her love interest starts off as a baffoon and continues to be one, taking Pipers sexual advances as she says a sultry ""Goodbye"" which really means ""Let's do it"". as Goodbye to impress her and be a her perfect guy. Sorry ladies not in this world! This is a fun movie especially for female teenagers as it's story book romance and star oriented goals are felt thouroughly. It's dramatic intensity is as deep as a puddle, while Flashdance had most viewers believing! This movie is sexy without offensive nudity and sex. Piper (Jersey) is really good in her part. John Goodman as Pipers dad plays a sensitive but easy role. You may finish this movie feeling good, or you may take it seriously enough to hate it's pie in the sky predictability.
