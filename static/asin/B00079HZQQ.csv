878804,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B00079HZQQ,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[0, 2]","""Fear X"" is a surprisingly boring movie based on a novel by Hubert Selby Jr (Requiem for a Dream (Director's Cut),Last Exit to Brooklyn [VHS]) While Selby's usual themes have been drug addicts, junkies, prostitutes, and people struggling with their addictions... this one is a mystery in the vein ofMemento) John Turturro is a mall security guard whose wife died under mysterious circumstances. He is hooked to watching security cameras, and rerunning the footage endlessly.In the beginning, there is a sense of dread and suspense. Turturro's character seems to be obsessed and slowly going mad. Things become more menacing as he goes on a quest to investigate his wife's death.  Slowly, the movie goes from being a meditation on loss, and has the horror movie atmosphere right... to being boring. In the end, this thriller did not thrill. It cured my insomnia. It's a tranquilizer. The movie goes from being compelling to a true sleeper.

Crazy person, isolated, trying to complete some sort of work, John Turturro.  That led into a slow mood piece that certainly took it's time making its point.  Unfortunately, this is not an especially effective film.  There are a few effective scenes to be sure, my favorite was when Turturro's character decides to look into the home across the street from his house.  The film tries to deal with how we deal with loss. This is not an original idea, but it's an idea that is very deep.  This character dives into the murder mystery, trying to solve it by examining surveillance tapes.  This concept doesn't go far as about half way through the movie it completely shifts gears and goes takes the viewer into the life of the man who shot his wife.  This character is uninteresting and best I can tell unnecessary.  Perhaps they were going for originality, but there is nothing to invest in this character.  We get to see the inner workings of why the wife was killed, but quite frankly who cares?  Why they do this is beyond me and it hurts the slow momentum the film was building.  I did like the cinematography of the film.  Much of it is soaked in bright red and it does a good job of capturing the main character's mood.  Also, the surveillance tapes, at times look very realistic and thus very creepy.  The story sort of works, but not really, and by the time the ending rolls around that ""Secret Window"" aroma had turned into a stench. **3/4",3,"An interesting, Honorable Failure",1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,1549,"['beginning', 'film', 'started', 'catch', 'small', 'aroma', 'reminded', 'Secret', 'Window', 'Crazy', 'person', 'isolated', 'trying', 'complete', 'sort', 'work', 'John', 'Turturro', 'led', 'slow', 'mood', 'piece', 'certainly', 'took', 'time', 'making', 'point', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'especially', 'effective', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'effective', 'scenes', 'be', 'sure', 'favorite', 'was', 'when', 'Turturro', 'character', 'look', 'home', 'street', 'house', 'film', 'tries', 'deal', 'how', 'deal', 'loss', 'not', 'original', 'idea', 'idea', 'very', 'deep', 'character', 'murder', 'mystery', 'trying', 'solve', 'examining', 'surveillance', 'tapes', 'concept', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'as', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'completely', 'shifts', 'gears', 'viewer', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'shot', 'wife', 'character', 'uninteresting', 'best', 'can', 'tell', 'unnecessary', 'Perhaps', 'were', 'going', 'originality', 'nothing', 'invest', 'character', 'get', 'see', 'inner', 'workings', 'why', 'wife', 'was', 'killed', 'quite', 'frankly', 'who', 'Why', 'do', 'slow', 'momentum', 'film', 'was', 'building', 'did', 'cinematography', 'film', 'Much', 'soaked', 'bright', 'red', 'good', 'job', 'capturing', 'main', 'character', 'mood', 'Also', 'surveillance', 'tapes', 'times', 'look', 'very', 'realistic', 'thus', 'very', 'creepy', 'story', 'sort', 'works', 'not', 'really', 'time', 'ending', 'rolls', 'Secret', 'Window', 'aroma', 'had', 'turned', 'stench', '**3/4']",N/A

I guess that is what passes for special effects in the overdrugged brain of the producer, but for me the viewer, it was very annoying.

878809,A367Q9VRWQZG7W,B00079HZQQ,Gavin B.,"[24, 25]","Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn, third film ""Fear X"" may baffle or frustrate his viewers with his non-linear plot line and it's leisurely pacing. Indeed Refn falls short on adhering to the protocols of commercial filmaking, but he is aiming, almost entirely, for effect, rather than aiming for commerce, in ""Fear X.""In this case, ""Fear X"" was  written by renowned novelist Hurbert Selby Jr. Selby's script has minimal dialogue and it's left to John Turturro's considerable acting skills to convey the obsessive quest of a mall security guard to find out the truth behind the seemingly random shooting of his wife.You are never completely certain, if the action on the screen is actually unfolding, or whether it's all happening in the mind of Harry Cain, Turturro's character. He frequently sees the mute ghost of his murdered wife, leading him to a sinister looking vacant house directly across the street from his own house. He eventually breaks into the house and finds a strip of photo negatives, which he believes to be the smoking gun left by his wife's murderer.It's clear that Harry Cain is obsessed, but we wonder if he's being good detective, or if he's a delusional madman whose paranoia leads him on a groundless quixotic investigation. Cain's co-workers are concerned about his erratic behavior  in the wake of his wife's death.Perhaps the entire film is a surreal parable about  moving from the first ""denial stage"" to fifth and final ""acceptance  stage"" in the 5 Stages of Grief  upon losing a loved one. Harry Cain exhibits all the five ritualized stages of grief and by the end of the film it's clear that he has accepted his wife's death and is ready to move on with his life.Rafn's filmmaking style may appear to be slow moving, but for those who appreciate camera and soundstage techniques the leisurely, unhurried pace of the film allows the viewer to take in Larry Smith's magnificent wide angle camera shoots and the use of a blood red tinted camera lens on some of the interior shots.The drama is enhanced by Brian Eno's ominous ambient soundtrack score. Indeed the entire film is an excellent workshop on how to use lighting, music, camera angles, and set design to ratchet up tension in a film. Those interested in filmmaking will find ""Fear X"" to be  ambient cinema, while those with shorter attention spans will find it boring.Like,David Lynch, Refn's filmmaking is allegorical, atmospheric and explores the murky regions of the subconscious mind.Rafn has shown enough talent in ""Fear X"" to  be regarded as part of  the future generation of innovative and artistic directors. It's not everyday that a filmmaker with the devious & subversive imagination of a Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, or Terry Gilliam comes along. Each of whom evolved into brilliant filmakers as their career progressed. I struggled between giving 4 stars or 5 stars to ""Fear X"" in the end it was 5 stars, simply on the potential Refn exhibits in this powerful psychological suspense movie. Like Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" and the Polish brothers' ""Northfork"", ""Fear X"" is destined to become a cult classic among cineastes.It is not a film for those who cannot tolerate ambiguity, but for those who have a taste for the unusual or quirky, ""Fear X"" is fascinating.",5,Fear X is Excellent Amibent-Noir Filmaking,1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,3262,"['Danish', 'director', 'Nicholas', 'Winding', 'Refn', 'third', 'film', 'Fear', 'X', 'may', 'baffle', 'frustrate', 'viewers', 'non-linear', 'plot', 'line', 'leisurely', 'pacing', 'Indeed', 'Refn', 'short', 'adhering', 'protocols', 'commercial', 'filmaking', 'aiming', 'almost', 'entirely', 'effect', 'rather', 'aiming', 'commerce', 'Fear', 'X', 'case', 'Fear', 'X', 'was', 'written', 'renowned', 'novelist', 'Hurbert', 'Selby', 'Jr.', 'Selby', 'script', 'minimal', 'dialogue', 'left', 'John', 'Turturro', 'considerable', 'acting', 'skills', 'convey', 'obsessive', 'quest', 'mall', 'security', 'guard', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'seemingly', 'random', 'shooting', 'wife.You', 'are', 'never', 'completely', 'certain', 'action', 'screen', 'actually', 'unfolding', 'happening', 'mind', 'Harry', 'Cain', 'Turturro', 'character', 'frequently', 'mute', 'ghost', 'murdered', 'wife', 'leading', 'sinister', 'looking', 'vacant', 'house', 'directly', 'street', 'own', 'house', 'eventually', 'house', 'strip', 'photo', 'negatives', 'be', 'smoking', 'gun', 'left', 'wife', 'murderer.It', 'clear', 'Harry', 'Cain', 'obsessed', 'wonder', 'being', 'good', 'detective', 'delusional', 'madman', 'paranoia', 'groundless', 'quixotic', 'investigation', 'Cain', 'co-workers', 'are', 'concerned', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'wake', 'wife', 'death.Perhaps', 'entire', 'film', 'surreal', 'parable', 'moving', 'first', 'denial', 'stage', 'fifth', 'final', 'acceptance', 'stage', '5', 'Stages', 'Grief', 'losing', 'loved', 'one', 'Harry', 'Cain', 'five', 'ritualized', 'stages', 'grief', 'end', 'film', 'clear', 'accepted', 'wife', 'death', 'ready', 'move', 'life.Rafn', 'filmmaking', 'style', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'slow', 'moving', 'who', 'appreciate', 'camera', 'soundstage', 'techniques', 'leisurely', 'unhurried', 'pace', 'film', 'viewer', 'take', 'Larry', 'Smith', 'magnificent', 'wide', 'angle', 'camera', 'shoots', 'use', 'blood', 'red', 'tinted', 'camera', 'lens', 'interior', 'shots.The', 'drama', 'enhanced', 'Brian', 'Eno', 'ominous', 'ambient', 'soundtrack', 'score', 'Indeed', 'entire', 'film', 'excellent', 'workshop', 'how', 'use', 'lighting', 'music', 'camera', 'angles', 'set', 'design', 'ratchet', 'up', 'tension', 'film', 'interested', 'filmmaking', 'will', 'find', 'Fear', 'X', 'be', 'ambient', 'cinema', 'shorter', 'attention', 'spans', 'will', 'find', 'boring.Like', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Refn', 'filmmaking', 'allegorical', 'atmospheric', 'murky', 'regions', 'subconscious', 'mind.Rafn', 'shown', 'enough', 'talent', 'Fear', 'X', 'be', 'regarded', 'part', 'future', 'generation', 'innovative', 'artistic', 'directors', 'not', 'everyday', 'filmmaker', 'devious', 'subversive', 'imagination', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'along', 'whom', 'evolved', 'brilliant', 'filmakers', 'career', 'progressed', 'struggled', 'giving', '4', 'stars', '5', 'stars', 'Fear', 'X', 'end', 'was', '5', 'stars', 'simply', 'potential', 'Refn', 'exhibits', 'powerful', 'psychological', 'suspense', 'movie', 'Lynch', 'Eraserhead', 'Polish', 'brothers', 'Northfork', 'Fear', 'X', 'destined', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'cineastes.It', 'not', 'film', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'tolerate', 'ambiguity', 'who', 'have', 'taste', 'unusual', 'quirky', 'Fear', 'X', 'fascinating']",N/A

878811,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00079HZQQ,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[5, 6]","At first viewing, this film seems, to be blunt, somewhat lame. Then you think about it. And then you realize it's absolutely not lame at all. It requires some serious mental input, but the rewards are there, definitely.This is not a trickathon flick like Memento. It's a much more subtle work that digs into you once you get what's really going on. The core of the film is, Is what we experience ""real"" or is it what we THINK is real?While it may appear initially that this question only applies to the protagonist, Harry Caine (John Turturro in an excellent performance), that's definitely not the case. The ""bad guy"", played by James Remar, a cop, is--if you think about it hard enough and pick up the clues--definitely experiencing the same mindset as Turturro's character. You have to put the pieces together. When you do, it's fascinating.Harry Caine has been experiencing tremendous grief after his wife's murder. Understandably. Part--a big part--of that grief is hallucinating her presence standing next to him in the bathroom, standing just outside his house, comforting him in the bedroom. He is absolutely obsessed with finding her killer.There is something--we don't exactly see what initially--about his next door neighbor--another cop (i.e., not James Remar's character) that leads him to break into the man's house when the owner is not there, where he finds what he thinks is a clue to his wife's death. He pursues that clue and ultimately runs into the James Remar character who may or may not have been responsible.The viewer has to pay very careful attention to the details here; details is what this film's all about. The ending scene itself is, when you think about it, a fitting piece of the puzzle (no, I'm not giving away the ending here). So this is really, one thinks, a story about retribution...or is it? In fact, it's really a story about attempting to bridge the gap between what we experience and what we mentally create as experience.That bridging of the gap does not always happen. Or sometimes it does happen and we can't handle it. Or sometimes it does happen and we handle it in a way that we think is the right way and then find out later--guess what? It was not the right way at all, after all. Not at all.A fascinating film, this bears more than one viewing to see what is really going on here. The screenplay was written by noted ""underground"" American writer Hubert Selby Jr. who has done a masterful job of piling on the layers and the subtlety. The director is Nicolas Refn, a Dane whose first film, Pusher (Danish) won kudos for both the director and the star, Kim Bodnia.Much better than you might expect--but you definitely have to make the effort to see what this is really about.Definitely recommended.",4,"Subtle, multi-layered, requires some real thought",1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,2750,"['first', 'viewing', 'film', 'be', 'blunt', 'somewhat', 'lame', 'Then', 'think', 'then', 'realize', 'absolutely', 'not', 'lame', 'serious', 'mental', 'input', 'rewards', 'are', 'there', 'definitely.This', 'not', 'trickathon', 'flick', 'Memento', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'work', 'once', 'get', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'core', 'film', 'what', 'experience', 'real', 'what', 'THINK', 'real', 'may', 'appear', 'initially', 'question', 'only', 'protagonist', 'Harry', 'Caine', 'John', 'Turturro', 'excellent', 'performance', 'definitely', 'not', 'case', 'bad', 'guy', 'played', 'James', 'Remar', 'cop', 'think', 'hard', 'enough', 'pick', 'up', 'clues', 'definitely', 'experiencing', 'same', 'mindset', 'Turturro', 'character', 'have', 'put', 'pieces', 'together', 'When', 'do', 'fascinating.Harry', 'Caine', 'been', 'experiencing', 'tremendous', 'grief', 'wife', 'murder', 'Understandably', 'Part', 'big', 'part', 'grief', 'hallucinating', 'presence', 'standing', 'next', 'bathroom', 'standing', 'just', 'house', 'comforting', 'bedroom', 'absolutely', 'obsessed', 'finding', 'killer.There', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'see', 'what', 'initially', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'cop', 'i.e.', 'not', 'James', 'Remar', 'character', 'break', 'man', 'house', 'when', 'owner', 'not', 'there', 'where', 'what', 'clue', 'wife', 'death', 'clue', 'ultimately', 'James', 'Remar', 'character', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'responsible.The', 'viewer', 'pay', 'very', 'careful', 'attention', 'details', 'here', 'details', 'what', 'film', 'ending', 'scene', 'when', 'think', 'fitting', 'piece', 'puzzle', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'away', 'ending', 'here', 'really', 'one', 'story', 'retribution', 'fact', 'really', 'story', 'attempting', 'bridge', 'gap', 'what', 'experience', 'what', 'mentally', 'create', 'bridging', 'gap', 'not', 'always', 'happen', 'happen', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'happen', 'handle', 'way', 'think', 'right', 'way', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'guess', 'what', 'was', 'not', 'right', 'way', 'Not', 'all.A', 'fascinating', 'film', 'more', 'one', 'viewing', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'here', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'noted', 'underground', 'American', 'writer', 'Hubert', 'Selby', 'Jr.', 'who', 'done', 'masterful', 'job', 'piling', 'layers', 'subtlety', 'director', 'Nicolas', 'Refn', 'Dane', 'first', 'film', 'Pusher', 'Danish', 'won', 'kudos', 'director', 'star', 'Kim', 'Bodnia.Much', 'better', 'might', 'expect', 'definitely', 'have', 'make', 'effort', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'about.Definitely', 'recommended']",N/A

878815,A17BUUBOU0598B,B00079HZQQ,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[0, 0]","Fear Xis a movie that I can see fans of independent film being split down the middle about.  There are a lot of creative and daring choices being made here, and many of them work.  Certainly this is a movie that is worth being studied by aspiring film-makers and actors for its technical merits.  The lighting, music, and visuals are all used convincingly to create a mood of dread and anticipation.  The problem is that the story itself never seems to coincide with this mood.  By the time you arrive at the crux of the film, it is neither surprising nor is it compelling.John Turturro plays Harry Cain in a very understated performance.  When his wife is murdered with no explanation, his modest life as a security guard deteriorates into the depressing.  We are supposed to believe that he becomes *obsessed* with discovering what happened to her.  But in actuality, he seems to be going through the motions more than really chasing her killers.  Most of the plot just *happens* and the concern of those around him seems contrived and unconvincing, which is perhaps done intentionally to alienate his character.Hidden beneath the veneer of this unconventional story are some very common mistakes that degrade the value of any brand of film.  The story never builds any of the characters enough for us to feel connected with them.  And where the characters behave in ways that are unexpected, the story does not seem to tie that in to the plot.  Rather, it seems to just portray the story at face value with little tie in between what is real and what is imagined.  As such, some very powerful aspects of this film fall very flat.The camera work is excellent, but seems to work against the very flat characters as much as the actors do.  I have no doubt they were playing them as written, but perhaps better direction and editing would have released more of the *dread* they were aiming for.  We have a large number of close-ups of John Turturro that are meant to communicate anger and rage boiling beneath the surface and look more like indifference.  Other character's faces are framed similarly, and their expressions are almost all just as blank.I am a huge fan of David Lynch and I find the comparison's to his films to be misplaced.  I also really love psychological drama, and yet all of the great camera work seems to counteract the psychological aspects of this movie.  And the sparseness of the script is something I could accept if it were executed better.  Here, so many of those slow scenes are counteracted by clich&eacute; characters.  All of the law enforcement characters in this movie are examples of that.CONCLUSIONI can't recommend this movie except to the most daring of film-goers.  Mostly, this is a film that will suit a certain audience of film students more than film watchers.  If you want to learn how to use music, lighting and pacing to create a mood in film, this has to be high up on your list of films to study.  Similarly, if you are a fan of John Turturro and just want to see everything he has ever done, you will have to add this one to your list.  Be prepared to watch this several times.  This is definitely not for those with a short attention span.If you are looking for a far-out creative movie to enjoy, this movie is both too far-out and not far-out enough.  I think this could have been more than the technical achievement that it is.  But as a film the story-telling aspect seems somewhat of an afterthought here.Avoid.",3,"Fear X - A Mood Movie, With More Mood Than Movie",1233273600,"01 30, 2009",2009,3467,"['Fear', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'fans', 'independent', 'film', 'being', 'split', 'down', 'middle', 'are', 'lot', 'creative', 'daring', 'choices', 'being', 'made', 'here', 'many', 'work', 'Certainly', 'movie', 'worth', 'being', 'studied', 'aspiring', 'film-makers', 'actors', 'technical', 'merits', 'lighting', 'music', 'visuals', 'are', 'used', 'convincingly', 'create', 'mood', 'dread', 'anticipation', 'problem', 'story', 'never', 'coincide', 'mood', 'time', 'arrive', 'crux', 'film', 'surprising', 'compelling.John', 'Turturro', 'Harry', 'Cain', 'very', 'understated', 'performance', 'When', 'wife', 'murdered', 'explanation', 'modest', 'life', 'security', 'guard', 'depressing', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', '*obsessed*', 'discovering', 'what', 'happened', 'actuality', 'be', 'going', 'motions', 'more', 'really', 'chasing', 'killers', 'Most', 'plot', 'just', '*happens*', 'concern', 'contrived', 'unconvincing', 'perhaps', 'done', 'intentionally', 'alienate', 'character.Hidden', 'beneath', 'veneer', 'unconventional', 'story', 'are', 'very', 'common', 'mistakes', 'degrade', 'value', 'brand', 'film', 'story', 'never', 'characters', 'enough', 'feel', 'connected', 'where', 'characters', 'behave', 'ways', 'are', 'unexpected', 'story', 'not', 'seem', 'tie', 'plot', 'Rather', 'just', 'portray', 'story', 'face', 'value', 'little', 'tie', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'imagined', 'such', 'very', 'powerful', 'aspects', 'film', 'fall', 'very', 'flat.The', 'camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'work', 'very', 'flat', 'characters', 'as', 'much', 'actors', 'do', 'have', 'doubt', 'were', 'playing', 'written', 'perhaps', 'better', 'direction', 'editing', 'would', 'have', 'released', 'more', '*dread*', 'were', 'aiming', 'have', 'large', 'number', 'close-ups', 'John', 'Turturro', 'are', 'meant', 'communicate', 'anger', 'rage', 'boiling', 'surface', 'look', 'more', 'like', 'indifference', 'Other', 'character', 'are', 'framed', 'similarly', 'expressions', 'are', 'almost', 'all', 'just', 'blank.I', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'David', 'Lynch', 'find', 'comparison', 'films', 'be', 'misplaced', 'also', 'really', 'love', 'psychological', 'drama', 'yet', 'great', 'camera', 'work', 'counteract', 'psychological', 'aspects', 'movie', 'sparseness', 'script', 'something', 'could', 'accept', 'were', 'executed', 'better', 'Here', 'so', 'many', 'slow', 'scenes', 'are', 'counteracted', 'clich', 'eacute', 'characters', 'law', 'enforcement', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'examples', 'that.CONCLUSIONI', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'most', 'daring', 'film-goers', 'Mostly', 'film', 'will', 'suit', 'certain', 'audience', 'film', 'students', 'more', 'film', 'watchers', 'want', 'learn', 'how', 'use', 'music', 'lighting', 'pacing', 'create', 'mood', 'film', 'be', 'high', 'list', 'films', 'study', 'Similarly', 'are', 'fan', 'John', 'Turturro', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'everything', 'ever', 'done', 'will', 'have', 'add', 'one', 'list', 'Be', 'prepared', 'watch', 'several', 'times', 'definitely', 'not', 'short', 'attention', 'span.If', 'are', 'looking', 'far-out', 'creative', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'too', 'far-out', 'not', 'far-out', 'enough', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'technical', 'achievement', 'film', 'story-telling', 'aspect', 'somewhat', 'afterthought', 'here.Avoid']",N/A

Eraserhead, however, maintained a sense of 'what the heck's going on' while still inserting interesting symbols in a completely odd storyline - absolutely nothing normal. Fear X mixed reality, normalcy and artistic wierdness - a combo that doesn't work as well. I did follow the direction of the film, not the plot, but the unusual unfolding of the mindset of a man desperate for answers. Since there was a plot, leaving the audience unsatisfied was more of a cruel tease than an artistic twist. John Turturro did an excellent job in his role. The external features of the film reflected well the desperation within the main character. I think the film would have actually done much better if not for the moment during which there was an obvious attempt to explain what was happening. If your film is wierd, leave it that way. Explanations simply make the film like half-cooked meat, it's almost there, but not quite what it should be. Fear X was a mix between Eraserhead and The Machinist.

878819,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B00079HZQQ,The Jaundiced Eye,"[6, 10]","This reminded me of an Ingmar Bergman film...the characters speak and act in ultra-slow motion and always maintain somber, downcast expressions. There is no joy...there is no humor...just relentless sadness and grief. It takes minutes for them to complete a single sentence, and then the sentence is generally not worth the time or effort.I know that the director is trying to create a cinematic masterpiece of pathos and psychological turmoil, but the characters and their behavior are so alien to reality that no empathy can be achieved.The acting is generally excellent, but at such an incredibly slow and distracting pace that you become numb to the situation. The cinematography is excellent, but relies on deep blood red colors in a trite and all-too-obvious manuever to establish an aura of imminent danger. There are some very suspenseful moments, but they rely heavily on background music for emphasis...which is ""cheating""...real suspense can stand on its own merits, and the main source of suspense in this movie is whether the characters will actually complete a sentence before the camera runs out of film.The ending, however, is the ultimate insult.  After investing 85 minutes of your valuable time, fighting the urge to take a nap while the actors complete their dialog and hoping that there will be a satisfactory resolution to reward you for your time and patience, suddenly the screen turns into about 60 seconds of red scribbles and loud noise. I naturally assumed that my television had malfunctioned, but no...it was the director who had malfunctioned. This was apparently his artsy, abstract way of conveying madness, rage, angst, or.....who the heck knows???Your misery is not quite over, though, because there is one final scene of draggy, humorless dialog, somber expressions, and....absolutely no payoff.
