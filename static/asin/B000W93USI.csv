1107541,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B000W93USI,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[0, 0]","This is a threadbare, lamentable movie that barely has enoughprofessional sheen to pass as a commercial feature. There's clearly anidea behind it and some hard work and effort went into it, but notenough to make any investors stump up the cash needed to make it cometo life. Camera work, editing, sound and special effects all look likehome movie work. The sound is particularly bad, it's very muffled anddistorted, and (as other reviewers have pointed out), the colour of themovie has suffered badly on most available copies, and everything looksa shade of muddy orange. Thank goodness for colour hue adjustment onmodern PCs, which at least helped me improve this on my viewing!The plot sees a family move into a large new home. The daughter, ayoung girl named Cathy, finds a creepy doll and becomes possessed bythe spirit of it's former owner. Under this influence she terrorisesand kills friends and family members in some rather odd supernaturalways. Most of what happens in the running time is brain-testinglyboring, but a few scenes did actually stand out for me. The onestrength of the film is the young Randi Allen in the role of Cathy, whohas just the right kind of ominous stare to make her character actuallyappear creepy, and she even has some acting skill. All the other actingis dreadful. Cathy's mother Vivian is particularly intolerable, plusshe has the weirdest zombie eyes of any actress I've ever seen withoutmakeup.A low budget can work if the film is saved by a good script or goodacting, but here we don't have the required acting talent, and puttingthat together with a dreadful script and poorly planned scenes reallymake the film fall apart from beginning to end. It's actually a choreto watch. The only times I l did find I was enjoying looking at thescreen was when Randi Allen was cursing and screaming at people, and acouple of times when the eyes on a spooky portrait in the attic wentall evil and glowing. This spooky portrait, plus the doll with it'seyes sewn shut are the only two decent ideas in the film. Actually,I'll be generous, although I moaned about the terrible ambient sound,some of the creepiness of the film does come from the soundtrack, whensome effective slowed-down voices and laughter adds atmosphere in someof the spooky scenesThe makers of Cathy's Curse have a lot to be grateful for in RandiAllen for playing the title role of Cathy straight. If this pivotalrole had been bungled by a really bad child actress, then &#34;Cathy'sCurse&#34; would be a total laughing stock worthy of Doris Wishmancomparison. Actually, that might have propelled it into higher cultstatus. As it stands, its just one more super-cheap attempt at serioushorror that fails to deliver.",2,Crud,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,2713,"['threadbare', 'lamentable', 'movie', 'barely', 'enoughprofessional', 'sheen', 'pass', 'commercial', 'feature', 'clearly', 'anidea', 'hard', 'work', 'effort', 'went', 'make', 'investors', 'stump', 'up', 'cash', 'needed', 'make', 'cometo', 'life', 'Camera', 'work', 'editing', 'sound', 'special', 'effects', 'look', 'likehome', 'movie', 'work', 'sound', 'particularly', 'bad', 'very', 'muffled', 'anddistorted', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'colour', 'themovie', 'suffered', 'badly', 'most', 'available', 'copies', 'everything', 'looksa', 'shade', 'muddy', 'orange', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'colour', 'hue', 'adjustment', 'onmodern', 'PCs', 'least', 'helped', 'improve', 'viewing', 'plot', 'family', 'move', 'large', 'new', 'home', 'daughter', 'ayoung', 'girl', 'named', 'Cathy', 'creepy', 'doll', 'becomes', 'possessed', 'bythe', 'spirit', 'former', 'owner', 'influence', 'terrorisesand', 'kills', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'rather', 'odd', 'supernaturalways', 'Most', 'what', 'running', 'time', 'brain-testinglyboring', 'few', 'scenes', 'did', 'actually', 'stand', 'out', 'onestrength', 'film', 'young', 'Randi', 'Allen', 'role', 'Cathy', 'whohas', 'just', 'right', 'kind', 'ominous', 'stare', 'make', 'character', 'actuallyappear', 'creepy', 'even', 'acting', 'skill', 'other', 'actingis', 'dreadful', 'Cathy', 'mother', 'Vivian', 'particularly', 'intolerable', 'plusshe', 'weirdest', 'zombie', 'eyes', 'actress', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'withoutmakeup.A', 'low', 'budget', 'can', 'work', 'film', 'saved', 'good', 'script', 'goodacting', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'required', 'acting', 'talent', 'together', 'dreadful', 'script', 'poorly', 'planned', 'scenes', 'reallymake', 'film', 'fall', 'apart', 'beginning', 'end', 'actually', 'choreto', 'watch', 'only', 'times', 'l', 'did', 'find', 'was', 'enjoying', 'looking', 'thescreen', 'was', 'when', 'Randi', 'Allen', 'was', 'cursing', 'screaming', 'people', 'acouple', 'times', 'when', 'eyes', 'spooky', 'portrait', 'attic', 'wentall', 'evil', 'glowing', 'spooky', 'portrait', 'doll', ""it'seyes"", 'sewn', 'shut', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'decent', 'ideas', 'film', 'Actually', ""'ll"", 'be', 'generous', 'moaned', 'terrible', 'ambient', 'sound', 'creepiness', 'film', 'come', 'soundtrack', 'whensome', 'effective', 'slowed-down', 'voices', 'laughter', 'atmosphere', 'someof', 'spooky', 'scenesThe', 'makers', 'Cathy', 'Curse', 'have', 'lot', 'be', 'grateful', 'RandiAllen', 'playing', 'title', 'role', 'Cathy', 'straight', 'pivotalrole', 'had', 'been', 'bungled', 'really', 'bad', 'child', 'actress', 'then', '34', ""Cathy'sCurse"", '34', 'would', 'be', 'total', 'laughing', 'stock', 'worthy', 'Doris', 'Wishmancomparison', 'Actually', 'might', 'have', 'propelled', 'higher', 'cultstatus', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'super-cheap', 'attempt', 'serioushorror', 'deliver']",N/A
1107542,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000W93USI,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[8, 13]","Ah, here's proof that the worst movies don't always come out of Hollywood.  I believe this putrid cesspool of a film came from north of the border.  Good day, eh?  I think not.  Some joker unplugged my little refrigerator over spring break one year, and my reaction upon returning to college and opening that refrigerator door is very close to the reaction I had to this movie.  Cathy's Curse stinks like Limburger cheese left out in the hot sun for about four months.  You have to start with the film quality itself.  Something made in 1977 should not look this bad - the print is terribly faded, there are lines popping up in the middle of the screen constantly, and the two little background place cards used to introduce the back-story look like something out of the early days of silent film.  I think we finally know what was inside that piece of Samsonite luggage that big gorilla threw around and jumped up and down on back in the late 1970s - it was the original print of this movie.Of course, even the most vibrant of prints could never add any color or vitality to these insipid characters.  Here's the story in a nutshell.  A mother runs off with her son, and then the boy's father and sister are killed in a car crash.  Fast forward about twenty-five years.  The boy moves back to the old family home, bringing along his wife and daughter.  The daughter immediately falls under the ""curse"" which manifests itself in a filthy old doll with sewn-up eyes.  The mother has already had a nervous breakdown some time earlier, but you can't possibly feel sorry for her because she's just so incredibly annoying.  The dad, of course, thinks his little girl is an angel, so he doesn't believe all of his wife's crazy talk about the way she's changed.  He seems oblivious to the fact that some really weird things keep happening, including a couple of suspicious deaths.  The little girl - bless her heart - is the only person with any acting ability whatsoever, but all she really has to do is stare at people.You know how everything's going to end - the only element of suspense involves the number of characters that will die.  Believe me, you'll be fervently hoping that just about every character bites the big one after about ten minutes in.  The idea behind the story isn't all that bad (although it's already been done to death), but the execution is abysmal.  The acting is bad, but the editing is even worse; the director obviously employed the hopscotch style of filmmaking, just hopping from one scene to another, never raising his eyes to look either forward or backward.  Cathy's Curse is a textbook example of bad filmmaking.",1,"If Moses had seen this film, there would have been an 11th commandment",1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,2643,"['Ah', 'here', 'proof', 'worst', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'believe', 'putrid', 'cesspool', 'film', 'came', 'north', 'border', 'Good', 'day', 'eh', 'think', 'not', 'joker', 'unplugged', 'little', 'refrigerator', 'spring', 'break', 'one', 'year', 'reaction', 'returning', 'college', 'opening', 'refrigerator', 'door', 'very', 'close', 'reaction', 'had', 'movie', 'Cathy', 'Curse', 'stinks', 'Limburger', 'cheese', 'left', 'out', 'hot', 'sun', 'four', 'months', 'have', 'start', 'film', 'quality', 'Something', 'made', '1977', 'should', 'not', 'look', 'bad', 'print', 'terribly', 'faded', 'are', 'lines', 'popping', 'up', 'middle', 'screen', 'constantly', 'two', 'little', 'background', 'place', 'cards', 'used', 'introduce', 'back-story', 'look', 'something', 'early', 'days', 'silent', 'film', 'think', 'finally', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'inside', 'piece', 'Samsonite', 'luggage', 'big', 'gorilla', 'threw', 'around', 'jumped', 'up', 'down', 'back', 'late', '1970s', 'was', 'original', 'print', 'movie.Of', 'course', 'even', 'most', 'vibrant', 'prints', 'could', 'never', 'add', 'color', 'vitality', 'insipid', 'characters', 'Here', 'story', 'nutshell', 'mother', 'son', 'then', 'boy', 'father', 'sister', 'are', 'killed', 'car', 'crash', 'Fast', 'forward', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'boy', 'back', 'old', 'family', 'home', 'bringing', 'wife', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'immediately', 'curse', 'filthy', 'old', 'doll', 'sewn-up', 'eyes', 'mother', 'already', 'had', 'nervous', 'time', 'earlier', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'feel', 'sorry', 'just', 'so', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'dad', 'course', 'little', 'girl', 'angel', ""n't"", 'believe', 'wife', 'crazy', 'talk', 'way', 'changed', 'oblivious', 'fact', 'really', 'weird', 'things', 'keep', 'happening', 'including', 'couple', 'suspicious', 'deaths', 'little', 'girl', 'bless', 'heart', 'only', 'person', 'acting', 'ability', 'whatsoever', 'really', 'do', 'stare', 'people.You', 'know', 'how', 'everything', 'going', 'end', 'only', 'element', 'suspense', 'number', 'characters', 'will', 'die', 'Believe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fervently', 'hoping', 'just', 'character', 'big', 'one', 'ten', 'minutes', 'idea', 'story', ""n't"", 'bad', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'execution', 'abysmal', 'acting', 'bad', 'editing', 'even', 'worse', 'director', 'obviously', 'employed', 'hopscotch', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'just', 'hopping', 'one', 'scene', 'never', 'raising', 'eyes', 'look', 'forward', 'backward', 'Cathy', 'Curse', 'textbook', 'example', 'bad', 'filmmaking']",N/A

I firmly believe that you can have a strong horror movie with a minimal budget work well with a good script (Please see I BURY THE LIVING or Blair Witch Projcet ). Sadly, too often we end up with something like Cathy's Curse.This movie succeeds in one thing, scary scenes, unfortunately the scenes seem to have come first in the script and they sort of forgot a reason for them. This is the plot. A young girl dies in 1947 when she forces her father to drive off the road to avoid hitting a rabbit. They both die in the crash but the dead girl, Joanne possesses a doll which affects her niece, Cathy thirty years later. Maybe I am a little hard hearted but I can't figure out why a little girl who dies in a car crash has such an unsettled spirit which leads to murder and bloodshed of the people who have literally NOTHING to do with the accident that kills her. Joann through Cathy seems to want to destroy all women because Joann's father rushed her to the car and crashed yelling ""All women are bitches."" Yeah, that's not a good enough reason for a horror movie.Again, the horror scenes work because they are genuinely disturbing and the acting holds up throughout. I'm not a big fan of evil doll stories but i guess this is one of the better oens because the director was smart enough to not let the doll talk, instead the doll infects Cathy and she talks for it. That works as well.Like most bad films, I recommend watching this if you happen to stumble across it in a 50 movie DVD budget pack. The quality of the transfer I saw was very poor and that actually enhances the horror. I feel if this movie was remastered and restored to pristine condition, everything would look unmistakably stupid.",2,So...why is the dead girl's spirit seeking revenge?,1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,1804,"['too', 'often', 'case', 'low', 'budget', 'sci', 'fi', 'horror', 'films', 'script', 'suffer', 'most', 'firmly', 'believe', 'can', 'have', 'strong', 'horror', 'movie', 'minimal', 'budget', 'work', 'well', 'good', 'script', 'Please', 'see', 'BURY', 'LIVING', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Projcet', 'Sadly', 'too', 'often', 'end', 'up', 'something', 'Cathy', 'Curse.This', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'scary', 'scenes', 'unfortunately', 'scenes', 'seem', 'have', 'come', 'first', 'script', 'sort', 'forgot', 'reason', 'plot', 'young', 'girl', 'dies', '1947', 'when', 'father', 'drive', 'off', 'road', 'avoid', 'hitting', 'rabbit', 'die', 'crash', 'dead', 'girl', 'Joanne', 'doll', 'niece', 'Cathy', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'Maybe', 'am', 'little', 'hard', 'hearted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'car', 'crash', 'unsettled', 'spirit', 'murder', 'bloodshed', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'literally', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'accident', 'Joann', 'Cathy', 'want', 'destroy', 'women', 'Joann', 'father', 'rushed', 'car', 'crashed', 'yelling', 'women', 'are', 'bitches', 'Yeah', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'reason', 'horror', 'movie.Again', 'horror', 'scenes', 'work', 'are', 'genuinely', 'disturbing', 'acting', 'up', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'evil', 'doll', 'stories', 'i', 'guess', 'one', 'better', 'oens', 'director', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'not', 'let', 'doll', 'talk', 'instead', 'doll', 'Cathy', 'as', 'well.Like', 'most', 'bad', 'films', 'recommend', 'watching', 'happen', 'stumble', '50', 'movie', 'DVD', 'budget', 'pack', 'quality', 'transfer', 'saw', 'was', 'very', 'poor', 'actually', 'horror', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'remastered', 'restored', 'pristine', 'condition', 'everything', 'would', 'look', 'unmistakably', 'stupid']",N/A
