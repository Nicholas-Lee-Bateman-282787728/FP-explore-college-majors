This was recommended by a friend after we saw Koi Mil Gaya. It was better than Koi Mil Gaya. It was better than we expected. It was better than RA-One by FAR! (Read my review of that one.)There is some violence in this movie, but it isn't taken as far and is not 'glorified' the way it is in Western movies. Krrish is an excellent character. The actors did well (not a fan of Mama, though)and the storyline is good. The movie is rated for ages 12+ because of the violence. My 7 y/o watched it before we saw the rating and she was far less affected by THIS movie than she was by the violence in The 3 Stooges. She chalked this one up to 'imaginary super hero'.

1013246,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000HDZ96U,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","First, let me quickly mentionKoi... Mil Gaya, a 2003 film about a mentally handicapped man named Rohit who receives superhuman powers from a space alien. KRRISH is the 2006 sequel, which then tells the story of Rohit's son, Krishna. KRRISH also unleashes India's first cinematic superhero, which probably has something to do with this film breaking all sorts of Indian box office records.KRRISH opens with the very young and chubby boy Krishna Mehra unveiling his precocious talents to his astounded school instructors, who then begin to test him for his I.Q. level. Krishna's grandmother (Rekha), fearful of the consequences, takes Krishna far, far away and raises him in the isolation of the forests and mountains.Years later, the boy has grown up an innocent, sheltered, but very well-muscled young man (as Hrithik Roshan now takes over the role). Krishna is at peace with nature and its creatures. And, boy, does he smile a lot, I'm assuming because he's pure of heart or something. It's at this stage that he meets the visiting Priya (Priyanka Chopra), whom he saves when her glider collides with a tree. In spending time with Priya and becoming smitten with her, Krishna reveals his superhuman abilities. When Priya, who's only in India on a 15 day vacation, has to return to Singapore, Krishna is grief stricken. Priya also doesn't feel too good about her leavetaking, but it's more because she and her friend Honey realize that they're reporting 5 days late to their jobs at a media network. On the verge of being fired, Honey tells their boss about Krishna and his talents. Honey convinces the reluctant Priya to use the pretense of love to get Krishna to Singapore. But, really, they want to put him on television and, thus, save their jobs.If this sounds like I'm giving away the whole story, you're wrong. That's only a smidgen of what goes on in this film. I'll sum up the rest of the plot in one sentence: Krishna does end up in Singapore, inadvertently becomes a superhero, and foils the uncool plan of an evil, egotistical scientist.For Bollywood, KRRISH is big scale movie making. It's your quintessential escapist flick and displays an unabashed sense of fun and enthusiasm. The filmmakers really went to work on this one, although there's still that trademark frivolity present, which is a signature of most Bollywood films. Now, this movie is 3 hours long, so when I say that the bulk of the movie's first half deals with the sugary-sweet love story between Krishna and career girl Priya, well, that's a lot of comedy romance for a superhero flick. The superhero element is still there, throughout, as Krishna does persist in engaging in impossible feats, but this element is overshadowed by the romance. But, following the sizzling musical number at the circus, Krrish is born and the action begins and then never relents.I thought the special effects rocked. Stunt choreographer Tony Ching Siu-tung (HERO, SHAOLIN SOCCER, HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS) concocts exhilarating wire-fu stunts, quite reminiscent of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. In his black leather duster and black, zigzagged circus mask, Krrish looks amazing, very cool. He performs acrobatics, swims like a dolphin, leaps to improbable heights, and performs wushu. There's also an undeniable nod to THE MATRIX. The fight scenes are slick and without the amateurish fight sound effects Bollywood sometimes inflicts on its films. Really, the only effect which sucks is the unconvincing sequence with the forest backdrop where Krrish is kicking ninja booty in super speed.As directed by his father Rakesh Roshan (who also directed him in KOI MIL GAYA), I thought Hrithik did a fine job of acting in both the roles of Krishna and his look-alike dad Rohit. He portrays both Krishna and Rohit with such distinct and differing personalities that his playing dual parts never really becomes a distraction. His Krishna is so effervescent and (dare I say?) so soulful a character that I couldn't help but like and root for him. Even though he does fling that ""Ain't I hunky?"" grin way too often. Rekha as Sonia Mehra, Krishna's grandma, turns in a real good performance, especially when she strays from her character's stoic persona and turns on the water works. Naseeruddin Shah as the evil scientist Dr. Siddhant Arya gets a chance to cut loose, and he gleefully obliges us with a patented Master Villain-ish effort. Priyanka Chopra is beautiful, no doubt, but she's only decent here, suffering from Lois Lane-itis as she does. How could Priya not know that Krrish is Krishna? You think the similarity in names just might be a clue? And if she already knows someone with special powers, and then someone in the same vicinity shows up displaying special powers but in a costume, then this might be a hint that it's the same dude, right? Oy!And, of course, there are the songs, but only four of them here, although KRRISH oddly doesn't indulge in its first musical number until about 40 minutes into it. Once again, Hrithik shows off his grace and fluidity in dancing. I really like the circus number, where he busts some serious moves. Priyanka also acquits herself well in these musical numbers. But I've seen her do better. And since I'm babbling on about music here, a mention must go out to the appropriately grandiose score, which meshes very well with the superhero component.Even though the movie length is almost as long as this review, KRRISH is fun popcorn fare. No, it's not perfect or original. It borrows heavily from THE MATRIX, PAYCHECK, and, of course, a ton of superhero films. But the end result is worth watching for its sheer exuberance. There really are some dynamic, visually cool action moments here. One of my favorite scenes (and I have quite a few favorites here) is Krrish set on a panoramic cityscape as he indefatigably pursues a helicopter. Very nice, extended chase sequence. With KRRISH 2 still waiting in the wings, things look good for India's sole superhero, and I cannot wait to see what happens next. To echo the oft repeated quote in this film: ""Just imagine...""",4,Just imagine,1253318400,"09 19, 2009",2009,6076,"['First', 'let', 'quickly', 'mentionKoi', 'Mil', 'Gaya', '2003', 'film',

1013252,AUQAL4MV2CM2R,B000HDZ96U,"Warp Girl ""warpgirl""","[1, 1]","So this is the sequel toKoi...Mil Gayaand for those who haven't seen it, I'll try to keep things as vague as I can for this review, but I can't promise to keep completely spoiler free. The biggest spoiler is that the title character in this film, Krishna, is the son of Rohit, the hero of ""Koi... Mil Gaya."" Unlike most franchises, where each installment is compared to its predecessor, you can't do that here. While ""Krrish"" is the next chapter in the story, these are two very different films. Although Hrithik Roshan plays both heroes, Krishna and Rohit are only similar in the sense that they're very good human beings. Krishna, is sheltered, but supremely self-confident, he's completely comfortable in his own skin, and extremely adaptable. I don't think there's an awkward bone in his body. All qualities that Rohit doesn't have for various reasons.So twenty-odd years after ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" we see Mrs. Mehra has relocated into an unnamed (but must be the most beautiful) part of India (and the entire planet) in an effort to shield her grandson from the world. Petrified that the gifts the young man inherited from his father would be exploited and put him in grave peril, she emphatically forbids Krishna from behaving in any way that is not ""ordinary"" or ""normal."" Much to her never ending dismay, her grandson is a willful, headstrong, almost rebellious young man. Who makes no secret of the fact that her restrictions and the isolation stifles him.He's chafing at the bit so the arrival of a girl is really only the straw that breaks the camel's back. Once romance comes into play, all bets are off!Without getting into too much detail the guy with some major Shakti (powers) quite inadvertently becomes a superhero! I have to say I love how he gets the mask, and to me it doesn't have that ""hey I'm a SUPERHERO"" feeling. Okay the coat is a straight-up rip-off of The Matrix, but that coat is SEXY! It made Keanu Reeves a stud, (not that he isn't totally dishy without it) so why not invoke the magic of a black leather trench coat if you have it? I never leave the house without mine from September to early December! Besides it's the most versatile, Non-costume ever created for a Superhero, it's reversible! Besides, I can't be the only person on the planet sick of spandex right?The fact that Krishna does become Krrish, is yet another reason that you can't compare the two movies. Rohit, never became a Superhero in the same sense. Krrish, is definitely a S-U-P-E-R-H-E-R-O, complete with nearly every trope available to the title, except no secret lair. But part three gets released Nov. 3rd there's still time to work out the secret lair thing.But there's a lot more going on then just becoming a superhero for Krishna, there are adorable friends to be made, a city to explore, and a girl to woo. He's a busy guy. The girl is Priya, played by Priyanka Chopra. I'll be blunt, she doesn't deserve him! BUT Krishna is stubborn, and he's one of those people who will forgive someone they truly love just about anything. Still, it really was satisfying that he didn't act like a complete doormat when it came to her nonsense! All I can say is that if Priya hasn't grown up in part three, I'm rooting for the bad girl!Boy it's terribly hard avoiding spoilers for this one, but I'm trying. Naturally, in every superhero film there needs to be an Ultimate Bad Guy, and a threat against humanity, and there is one of each. But interestingly enough neither is the main thrust of the narrative here. I don't mean that it isn't incorporated well, it's perfectly acceptable, but I personally wasn't invested in either. Maybe it's because the threat to humanity, was a little more than my sense of the ridiculous could appreciate. BUT don't let that put you off, like I said, it's incidental to the actual tale. The story is about Krishna, entering into the world, and the discoveries he makes about himself, and his family.Okay, like always the technical stuff...Production and Direction, it's amazing what a difference two years can make. As I mentioned in my review for ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" the special effects in 2004 were on par with ""The Abyss"" here in 2006, they're mostly on par with ""The Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" FOR THE RECORD, I'VE ONLY EVER SEEN THE EDITED VERSIONS OF ""THE MATRIX"" ON NETWORK TV, and I've never seen ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" but I have seen clips and promos... both make sense because Mr. R.R. worked with both teams to come up with the movie magic and Roshan Jr. even went to China to learn advanced wirework. On the whole the efforts paid off, especially in the first half of the movie, where Mr. Hrithik Roshan looks as if he's been leaping through treetops since birth. The first major fight scene in the second half is also very, very, well done.Remember, it might not be the level of amazing we got here in the states in 2006 but, 1,000,000 rupees = 18,000 US dollars!Unfortunately, Mr. R.R. made a fatal mistake during the climax. He had to go and guild the lily. I think it was a moment of ""look at all these cool toys and what we can DO!"" Sometimes, it's better to know when to stop. As Krrish goes on an Avenging Angel spree, the special effect hinder rather than help. Thank God, Hrithik Roshan has those magnetic eyes that fill with emotion because they pull you back into the scene and keep you there.Still, I say kudos to Mr. R.R. for doing something brave and risking the family prestige and business reputation on something that in his country's popular culture is still very new. The sci-fi and fantasy genres are big risks in Indian cinema from a popular and business standpoint. Sharuhk Khan, one of the very biggest and most popular entertainers in Hindi films of all time tried it, and let's just say the results were not exactly what he hoped for, (I still need to see RA-ONE until then I have no personal opinion) did he use A LOT of elements from popular films from around the world? Yes. Were there some rather blatant clich&eacute;s? Yes. Show me ONE superhero movie without them, not even Christopher Nolan could do it. But if you'll pardon some Vulcan philosophy, *The whole, is greater than the sum of it's parts.*Just like I wouldn't call ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" a copy of ET, I wouldn't call this movie a copy of any of the other films it uses as a template. As a whole it's unique unto itself, reflecting the values of the people who made it, and the culture they live in.Aesthetics, Okay I like to imagine that when Mr. R.R. and Mr. H.R. started planning this one perhaps the Jr. Roshan might have said, ""You know dad, maybe the wardrobe could be a little more streamlined."" LOL I have a warped imagination but the costumes are SO MUCH BETTER! Oye! I realize in ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" they tried to downplay Mr. H.R.'s physique until um... the first 3/4's of the movie, but after that... I still don't know what the thinking was there. You can't make the man look bad, that's just not possible, but at least there are no snake skin shirts. Krishna might be blissfully unaware he's a stud, but at least he dresses like it's 2006 and not 1989! Still, I like his village clothes best. They reflect who he is. Priyanka Chopra is not the kind of girl who'd be caught DEAD in any dated wardrobe, and she even got killer shoes the minx! Ms. Zinta deserved better!As for the sets I adore Krishna's house, it might be my new dream house! Most of the movie is shot outdoors, and of course outdoor cinematography in Hindi films is second-to-none in my experience. John Ford would be jealous at the vistas they have to work with. Singapore, is also shot to her best advantage. As for the Villain's lair, okay I admit it, it's very 90's Star Trek, but as a major Trekkie I'm not going to hate on it. Warm and fuzzy childhood memories you know. I'd give it a good solid A.Performances, I'm getting point where even I am sick of praising Hrithik Roshan. I swear the man creeps me out! When I watch ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" I forget about Krishna entirely, and when I watch ""Krrish"" I almost forget the same actor did each role. Seriously folks, this is the level of talent the man has! The plain fact is I've NEVER seen him give a BAD one. Could some of the movies be better? Yes. But he himself is never BAD. His dad is still pretty ""old-school"" in his approach so yes, there are moments when things get a little ""hammy"" and this isn't his absolute best role ever, BUT he HURTS HIMSELF doing this series! He hurt himself filming ""Koi Mil Gaya"" he hurt himself twice during this one, and he dang near got killed when a wire broke. He's hurt himself a few times doing part three too! He's not using a stunt double folks, and for the record I think he's certifiably NUTS! If I were his mom I'd raise a ruckus with both Father and Son!Rekha, If possible I think she's even more effective here then in ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" there are moments when I ache so badly with her that I feel like my heart's being shredded. I hope she's in part three they're keeping quiet about it. If she isn't they'll be a huge hole in the fabric of the story. She's vital. I'm fast becoming a Rekha fan of epic proportions.Okay, I have to do it, Priyanka Chopra... She might be my biggest Bollywood disappointment. You see, I *adored* her inWhat's Your Raashee ? (Dvd)andLove Story 2050 (Hindi Film / Bollywood Movie / Indian Cinema DVD)she was so fresh, and lively, and GENUINE! But somehow after watching her evolve she's become so mechanical, and gives off this ""I'm a star"" vibe that just irritates me to no end! I hate it when I can tell an actor is acting! I don't know what happened to her, but I miss the fresh-faced, genuine Miss Chopra.Interestingly enough, Aishwarya Rai was offered the lead in both ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" and here in Krrish, scheduling conflicts wrecked both. Now, there is probably no bigger fan of the onscreen Jodi of Roshan/Rai than I am, BUT I'm glad it didn't work out. If she'd done ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" well, I can't say much without spoiling but suffice it to say, I would've hated this movie. If she'd done this movie, then her pregnancy would've forced her to be written out of part three, which would have made me sad. So here's hoping she'll sign a project with Mr. Roshan in the near future. Quite honestly, while watching this movie I kept longing for Deepika Padukone to play Priya, I really think she would have been perfect.Naseeruddin Shah, A terrific actor who gave a half-hearted performance. Like I mentioned as the Ultimate Bad Guy he really had a tiny role, BUT that's partly why I'm a little cheesed off! His role inZindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011) (Hindi Movie / Bollywood Film / Indian Cinema DVD) - English Subtitleswas MUCH SMALLER, and he left a lasting impression. Here it's like he decided, ""oh I'm a cartoon villain, I'll just talk."" I'm sorry, but I expect more effort from such a highly celebrated actor. A little professional integrity would have been nice! Then again, from some of the interviews I've read he seems to be a little snobbish. My only issue with that is, why take the part at all? I might not be keen on Miss Chopra, but this is the one thing that I'll say is a true blemish on a very good film.Parents take note, this movie is more violent than ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" I wouldn't watch it with a child under 8, and there are scary moments that can disturb particularly sensitive children. I strongly, strongly, recommend watching it first and then deciding based on your children's individual needs. Maybe some of your younger children are able to process such things, maybe some older children cannot. But do use sound judgment.Music and Dances, Music quite honestly, it's great while you're watching the movie, but I can't remember any of the songs accept the Circus number. Dances, Hero is perfect as usual, Heroine, is adequate. The circus number is just as good but not better than Mr. Roshan's performance inLuck By Chance.Oh and since I forgot to mention it in my Review of ""Koi... Mil Gaya"" both my copies from Eros are just great, unfortunately I don't have the ones with all the great Special features, but the picture and sound is all fantastic!",5,Imagination Never Looked So
