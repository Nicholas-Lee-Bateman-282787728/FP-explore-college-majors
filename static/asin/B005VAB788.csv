1504206,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B005VAB788,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[7, 7]","Aiden (Chad Ford) is surprised to be invited to the commitment ceremony of his ex, Max ... and even more surprised when he is asked to step in as best man.  The problem is that Aiden is still very much in love with Max, although he doesn't want to interfere in his ex's chance for happiness with Forest, his very nurturing but somewhat controlling beau.  Aiden turns to his best female friend/roommate, Janice,  for advice, and she agrees he should be there, and suggests that he take along their mutual friend Lance, a twinkish party boy more than a decade younger than Aiden, to pose as his new boyfriend.  The introductions don't go quite as expected, with Max careful to demonstrate he is very much in love with Forest, while Lance only has eyes for Forest.  Janice develops a plan to force Max and Aiden to face their feelings for each other.This is a cute, though somewhat simplistic story, which is handled capably by the actors within the tiny indy budget available.  The film provides a positive depiction of gay and lesbian relationships, with a minimum of stereotyping.  The ending is a bit abrupt and largely unrealistic, which is the only real problem I have with the film.  Worth a look, and I'll give it four stars out of five.",4,"Worth a look, despite unrealistic, abrupt ending.",1325980800,"01 8, 2012",2012,1242,"['Aiden', 'Chad', 'Ford', 'surprised', 'be', 'invited', 'commitment', 'ceremony', 'ex', 'Max', 'even', 'more', 'surprised', 'when', 'asked', 'step', 'as', 'best', 'man', 'problem', 'Aiden', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'Max', ""n't"", 'want', 'interfere', 'ex', 'chance', 'happiness', 'Forest', 'very', 'nurturing', 'somewhat', 'controlling', 'beau', 'Aiden', 'best', 'female', 'friend/roommate', 'Janice', 'advice', 'should', 'be', 'there', 'take', 'along', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Lance', 'twinkish', 'party', 'boy', 'more', 'decade', 'younger', 'Aiden', 'pose', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'introductions', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'quite', 'as', 'expected', 'Max', 'careful', 'demonstrate', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'Forest', 'Lance', 'only', 'eyes', 'Forest', 'Janice', 'plan', 'force', 'Max', 'Aiden', 'face', 'feelings', 'other.This', 'cute', 'somewhat', 'simplistic', 'story', 'handled', 'capably', 'actors', 'tiny', 'indy', 'budget', 'available', 'film', 'positive', 'depiction', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'relationships', 'minimum', 'stereotyping', 'ending', 'bit', 'abrupt', 'largely', 'unrealistic', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'have', 'film', 'look', ""'ll"", 'give', 'four', 'five']",Hold Your Peace

But I didn't expect to love it, and think that it is one of the best movies I've seen in the last year.

1504208,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B005VAB788,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[4, 7]",".....at least a Couple of Feet...when I watch a Gay Romance movie.Sorry to say...this film got me barely an Inch.  Even after a couple of watchings.  And here are just a few reasons WHY (I exclude any comment on the storyline, which Bobby Lind has already done his stellar job of providing):- None of the (shared) 4-Leads struck me as being anything other than average actors (tho Blair Dickens, as Forrest, would get my vote for ""Stand-Out"" in this particular group---and not just because of his above average tallness).- Lead characters' LIKABLENESS was pretty much Nil for me:  dour acting...close-mouthed...whiny...taciturn-looking are just a few of the negative personal traits given these characters by writers and actors (tho, again, Dicken's role was written as more upbeat, more understanding).- Storyline is stale....having been done 100s of times in heterosexual wedding movies, throughtout the history of film.- Ah, yes...lest I forget The Girls.  Since most Gay Romances must give us the B(Girl)FF / Advisor, I'd have to grant that Melissa McCurley, as Samantha, does an OK job.  She only butts in, obtrusively, a couple of times (wait...maybe that's supposed to happen---Ugh).  The other 3 females on board help stretch out the action...but are not there for much more than that.- The last minute of the film is a Whirlwind...and I will cede to Mr. Lind's take on that.A Second STAR was added only due to decent cinematograpy and the acting of Blair / McCurleyI will NOT be keeping this film in my Gay DVD Library.",2,"I want to be ""TRANSPORTED"".....",1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,1528,"['..at', 'least', 'Couple', 'Feet', 'when', 'watch', 'Gay', 'Romance', 'movie.Sorry', 'say', 'film', 'got', 'barely', 'Inch', 'Even', 'couple', 'watchings', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'reasons', 'WHY', 'exclude', 'comment', 'storyline', 'Bobby', 'Lind', 'already', 'done', 'stellar', 'job', 'providing', 'None', 'shared', '4-Leads', 'struck', 'being', 'anything', 'other', 'average', 'actors', 'tho', 'Blair', 'Dickens', 'Forrest', 'would', 'get', 'vote', 'Stand-Out', 'particular', 'group', 'not', 'just', 'above', 'average', 'tallness', '.-', 'Lead', 'characters', 'LIKABLENESS', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'Nil', 'dour', 'acting', 'close-mouthed', 'whiny', 'taciturn-looking', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'negative', 'personal', 'traits', 'given', 'characters', 'writers', 'actors', 'tho', 'again', 'Dicken', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'more', 'upbeat', 'more', 'understanding', '.-', 'Storyline', 'stale', '.having', 'been', 'done', '100s', 'times', 'heterosexual', 'wedding', 'movies', 'history', 'film.-', 'Ah', 'yes', 'lest', 'forget', 'Girls', 'most', 'Gay', 'Romances', 'must', 'give', 'B', 'Girl', 'FF', '/', 'Advisor', ""'d"", 'have', 'grant', 'Melissa', 'McCurley', 'Samantha', 'OK', 'job', 'only', 'butts', 'obtrusively', 'couple', 'times', 'wait', 'maybe', 'supposed', 'happen', '-Ugh', 'other', '3', 'females', 'board', 'help', 'stretch', 'action', 'are', 'not', 'there', 'much', 'more', 'that.-', 'last', 'minute', 'film', 'Whirlwind', 'will', 'cede', 'Mr.', 'Lind', 'take', 'that.A', 'Second', 'STAR', 'was', 'added', 'only', 'due', 'decent', 'cinematograpy', 'acting', 'Blair', '/', 'McCurleyI', 'will', 'NOT', 'be', 'keeping', 'film', 'Gay', 'DVD', 'Library']",Hold Your Peace

I watch just about every gay film that comes out, especially the romantic comedies, but this one was neither romantic nor very comedic.  Honestly, after about 40 minutes I just couldn't take it anymore and had to shut it off.  The acting was forced and very mediocre, and sorry to say it, but the lead male actors weren't very attractive.

I laughed and growled during this movie. The men are good looking, the dialogue is urbane and witty and the struggle to find and keep love is pretty much right on. I was startled by the ending.
