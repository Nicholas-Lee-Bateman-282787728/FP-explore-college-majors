Females in uniform have a higher hurdle to clear just to be respected as being worthy of service whether gay or straight, and an early bar scene here shows how dangerous that quest can become...No overt lesbian sex in this film, just some light kissing, so go elsewhere if you're looking for lesbian passion. The passion here is to figure out how to serve in a community that turns against you thru lies and whispers.  I thought I had guessed the ending but was very happy to be oh-so-wrong.

The truth is each military branch has its own responsibilities and specialties.From the movie cover, you won't even realize that this is a story of a female marine coming out as a lesbian. You might have thought this movie is about ""discrimination"" to women in the military but the movie is pretty much aims at the argument that the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy is discriminatory. In my opinion, that is pretty much far from the truth; but that is for another topic of discussion, not for this review.Not much of plot and character development since one can pretty much know where the movie will be going based on the ""flags"" set as the scenes progresses.Even with the aim of making the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy a bad one; the story don't know which way to go. I mean if the story will go the ""show"" and develop the character or if the story will stick to ""show"" that the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy is a bad one. In my opinion, the movie split into into two that did not hold water instead of focusing on one path.For a movie run-time of an hour and thirty-six minutes (less the opening and closing credits), then it should have been enough to develop one path and make this a good movie.While watching the movie , there are times where I don't know what is happening anymore or what am I watching. The story is scattered around that I think some scenes are just thrown in to make the movie longer.Overlaying of music or soundtrack is okay; not too much and not too little.Overall, this is like watching an afternoon or lunch drama where you can count the number of characters (main, minor, and extras) in the movie without getting lost in the count.",1,A Review: A Marine Story,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,1864,"['First', 'off', 'one', 'major', 'gripe', 'have', 'movie', 'giving', 'message', 'everyone', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'military', 'United', 'States', 'Air', 'Force', 'United', 'States', 'Army', 'United', 'States', 'Navy', 'are', 'sissies', 'truth', 'military', 'branch', 'own', 'responsibilities', 'specialties.From', 'movie', 'cover', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'realize', 'story', 'female', 'marine', 'coming', 'out', 'lesbian', 'might', 'have', 'thought', 'movie', 'discrimination', 'women', 'military', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'aims', 'argument', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Ask', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Tell', 'policy', 'discriminatory', 'opinion', 'pretty', 'much', 'far', 'truth', 'topic', 'discussion', 'not', 'review.Not', 'much', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'one', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'where', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'going', 'based', 'flags', 'set', 'scenes', 'progresses.Even', 'aim', 'making', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Ask', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Tell', 'policy', 'bad', 'one', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'go', 'mean', 'story', 'will', 'go', 'show', 'develop', 'character', 'story', 'will', 'stick', 'show', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Ask', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Tell', 'policy', 'bad', 'one', 'opinion', 'movie', 'split', 'two', 'did', 'not', 'hold', 'water', 'instead', 'focusing', 'one', 'path.For', 'movie', 'run-time', 'hour', 'thirty-six', 'minutes', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'develop', 'one', 'path', 'make', 'good', 'movie.While', 'watching', 'movie', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'anymore', 'what', 'am', 'watching', 'story', 'scattered', 'think', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'thrown', 'make', 'movie', 'longer.Overlaying', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'okay', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'too', 'little.Overall', 'watching', 'afternoon', 'lunch', 'drama', 'where', 'can', 'count', 'number', 'characters', 'main', 'minor', 'extras', 'movie', 'getting', 'lost', 'count']",A Marine Story
