Thankfully it was not, and I am sure it would have been very rapidly replaced had it been, but that does not erase the fact that it was not properly affixed inside the package from the start. Such minor mishaps cause loss for everyone in one way or another.I am just happy that this time it was only a star in a rating and I will continue to be a customer.",4,Great Product but,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,547,"['problem', 'DVD', 'condition', 'content', 'movies', '34', 'Color', 'Night', '34', 'DVD', 'was', 'flopping', 'around', 'loose', 'container', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'damaged', 'Thankfully', 'was', 'not', 'am', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'rapidly', 'replaced', 'had', 'been', 'not', 'erase', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'properly', 'affixed', 'package', 'start', 'Such', 'minor', 'mishaps', 'cause', 'loss', 'everyone', 'one', 'way', 'another.I', 'am', 'just', 'happy', 'time', 'was', 'only', 'star', 'rating', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'customer']",Color of Night & Playing God + D.O.A. - Triple Feature
