882228,AFMEEXD78S9KI,B0007LPS4U,DMW18045,"[0, 0]","I originally bought his movie because I'm a long time Bruce Boxleitner fan.  As the story unfolded I became more involved in the story itself.  As well as dealing with dyslexia this films deals with relationships on many levels.  Mike (Kirk Douglas) has kept his secret throughout his life assisted by his now deceased wife and his best friend.  His son Patrick (Bruce Boxleitner) has always felt as if his father didn't care about him and it all had to do with Mike attempting to keep his secret. When Mike realizes his grandson also has dyslexia, in order to help him, he needs to make a decision he has long avoided. Patrick at first fights the realization that his son has a learning disability.  As the movie progresses and more is revealed he realizes that similar to the way his father kept him at a distance as a child he is doing similar to his own wife and son.  He knows he has to change in order to help his son.  Patrick comes to realize what his father's secret is and begins to understand why his father acted the way he did all those years ago and it wasn't because his father didn't love him. As a result the healing begins and relationships begin anew.",5,A Rewarding and Heartwarming Story,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,1170,"['originally', 'bought', 'movie', ""'m"", 'long', 'time', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'fan', 'story', 'unfolded', 'became', 'more', 'involved', 'story', 'As', 'well', 'dealing', 'dyslexia', 'films', 'deals', 'relationships', 'many', 'levels', 'Mike', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'kept', 'secret', 'life', 'assisted', 'now', 'deceased', 'wife', 'best', 'friend', 'son', 'Patrick', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'always', 'felt', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'had', 'do', 'Mike', 'attempting', 'keep', 'secret', 'When', 'Mike', 'grandson', 'also', 'dyslexia', 'order', 'help', 'make', 'decision', 'long', 'avoided', 'Patrick', 'first', 'fights', 'realization', 'son', 'learning', 'disability', 'movie', 'more', 'revealed', 'similar', 'way', 'father', 'kept', 'distance', 'child', 'doing', 'similar', 'own', 'wife', 'son', 'change', 'order', 'help', 'son', 'Patrick', 'realize', 'what', 'father', 'secret', 'understand', 'why', 'father', 'acted', 'way', 'did', 'years', 'ago', 'was', ""n't"", 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'result', 'healing', 'relationships', 'begin', 'anew']",N/A

Great movie as it also gives you the insight that people who can not read have feelings that they don't want others to know about.  Never look down on someone you may think is lesser than yourself as you may end up missing something wonderful in life.,4,Applegator43,1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,293,"['Bought', 'like', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'Great', 'movie', 'also', 'insight', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'read', 'have', 'feelings', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'others', 'know', 'about', 'Never', 'look', 'down', 'someone', 'may', 'think', 'lesser', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'missing', 'something', 'wonderful', 'life']",N/A

882232,A1MQQEM7W77L62,B0007LPS4U,Robert,"[19, 33]","""The Secret"" is a very good movie about letting your secrets go. Kirk Douglas plays Mike Dunmore, a well-liked man in his community. When he is asked to be a councilman he wants to do it, but he has a secret. His grandson is his life and Mike's son Patrick always resents him, so does he tell the truth? Mike's secret is actually pretty different. I didn't expect it.Kirk Douglas puts in a great performance as usual. You really feel for him. The only weakness is the grandson who seems a little too coached for his line readings. Besides that, ""The Secret"" is an excellent movie.",5,A Positive Review,1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,580,"['Secret', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'letting', 'secrets', 'go', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'Mike', 'Dunmore', 'well-liked', 'man', 'community', 'When', 'asked', 'be', 'councilman', 'do', 'secret', 'grandson', 'life', 'Mike', 'son', 'Patrick', 'always', 'so', 'tell', 'truth', 'Mike', 'secret', 'actually', 'pretty', 'different', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'it.Kirk', 'Douglas', 'great', 'performance', 'usual', 'really', 'feel', 'only', 'weakness', 'grandson', 'who', 'little', 'too', 'coached', 'line', 'readings', 'Secret', 'excellent', 'movie']",N/A
