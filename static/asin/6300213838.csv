McQueen gives an excellent performance of the aging bounty hunter that has outlived his usefulness and is out of place in the modern concrete world.  One poignant scene has McQueen and Ben Johnson exchanging dialogue between two old lawmen. This was Steve McQueen's last film and you can detect a sense of better days long gone by. Yet he went out in the vein as the cool man of action that he was best associated. This was probably Buzz Kulik's finest directorial achievement as well. Kulik never seemed to live up to his potential, but this is his best effort. Kulik was able to get great performances from the actors and develop a camaraderie that can be felt on the screen. The cast also included Eli Wallach, Kathryn Harrold and LeVar Burton. Composer Michel Legrand who scored ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" was brought in to score this last film for McQueen. This film was a critical failure. I beg to differ. Knowing a little about the type of man Steve McQueen was this film demonstrates his great ability as an actor and a real human being.

I saved his final movie for last and it was hard to watch the film knowing he was terminally ill at the time. Although McQueen complained about tiring easy and having a persistent cough, he probably did not know he was seriously ill and had a year or so to live.With that sadness in mind, I began to watch Steve McQueen's final film THE HUNTER. McQueen is still in great physical shape but close-ups of his face show he has aged far beyond his 49 or so years. He is still cool as real-life bounty hunter Ralph ""papa"" Thorson. McQueen seems to have fun with this role as an aging bounty hunter. Known for his superb race car and motorcyle-riding skills, McQueen is for the first time portraying a seriously bad driver who can't safely parallel park. Was he poking fun at his image and having fun with his reputation? THE HUNTER starts slowly but then we see the charm in the film. McQueen does not take himself seriously. In one scene, he is chasing a young criminal over the rooftops. When he realizes he has to jump across to another rooftop, McQueen steps back, gives a shrug as if to say ""Are you serious?"" and makes the jump. No doubt stunt doubles were used more in this film but it's still Steve McQueen in spirit.THE HUNTER is a forgotten McQueen film and it gives us an idea of what McQueen's future rolls might have been like. He could still play the serious macho cool man but with a tinge if introspection as he realize he is no longer young. McQueen died in 1980 at the age of 50 and there is no doubt he still had a lot of living and a lot of movies left to do. Farewell, Steve McQueen.

However, it is an interesting mix of comedy and action with an array of memorable characters that the viewer will remember. McQueen plays Ralph ""Papa"" Thorson, a modern day bounty hunter that will employ practically any means to capture bail jumpers. ( The real Ralph Thorson has a cameo in the film as a bartender) Though McQueen was ill at the time of production,( he allegedly only found out of his terminal condition after checking into the hospital after filming was completed) he gives a multilayered performance which shows his high degree of skill as an actor. There are of course some excellent action sequences, but what is more interesting is the subtle/low key humour that McQueen employs to round out his character: he is shown to be a terrible driver in the movie, while in real life he was near professional level. Also his love of antiques shows his old school obsessions and distrust of the modern world. "" Anything new is not good."" he states rather ruefully. There is a sweet subplot where his girlfriend( Kathryn Harrold) is preparing to have their child which collides with the scary main plot where a former quarry turns the tables on McQueen and comes after him for revenge. Eli Wallach is very amusing in a supporting role as a bail bondsman, as Levar Burton is as a bail jumper who is befriended by McQueen and starts hanging around his house. Mixed in along the way are several other scenes which show the professionalism and determination of McQueens' character to carry out his job, but still remain an honest and decent man at the end of the day. One in particular is very disturbing where a cop friend of McQueens' gets into deep trouble and can only see a violent solution to his problem. In 1980, I was on a plane from New York to Chicago when Good Morning America showed a clip from this just released film. It was very interesting to me that when I observed the fellow passengers( practically all of them were businessmen in suits fiddling with reports and calculators) they were simply hypnotized by Steve McQueens' presense when with gun in hand, he confronts a would be escapee with grit and droll humuor. I kind of felt then that they were thinking: "" Yeah, I wish I was doing something like that and was this guy."" So in summary, "" The Hunter"" is a well made action film/character study which caps the great Steve McQueens' career. Audiences will also appreciate the subtle/sly comedy which is very deftly worked into the film. Thankyou Mr. McQueen.

209304,A2XW6Y6NS70JSV,6300213838,"M. B. DaVega ""pop culture historian""","[4, 4]","Even though 1980 was unfortunately the year of Steve McQueen's tragic, untimely demise, the year should also be remembered in part for the release of his final two finished movies, 'Tom Horn' and 'The Hunter', as they are among his best films. It's, of course, truly unfortunate that McQueen died too early in his career ; he should have gone on to make legions of other films, but there's something so right and spot-on about his characterizations of Tom Horn and Ralph ""Papa"" Thorson here in 'The Hunter', that it's difficult to have imagined better, more fitting final performances for the late actor, who died after suffering a heart attack in a Juarez, Mexico hospital following surgery exactly 30 years ago today.In what would be his final performance, Steve McQueen -- much the same as his previous role -- plays another character inspired by an actual, real-life historical figure: modern-day bounty hunter Ralph ""Papa"" Thorson. Thorson works as a bail-enforcement agent for a bail bonding agency headed by fellow screen legend Eli Wallach tracking down various fugitives across the country. Not nearly as simple as I make it sound here, it is a riveting story with not just plenty of action, but also extensive drama and character development as well. Not only is Thorson forced to contend with the dangers of his job but also with feelings of uneasiness and misplacement in the modern age, as well as his tumultuous relationship with his pregnant girlfriend, (Kathryn Harrold)His exploits as a bounty hunter come back to haunt him as lately he has become the target of a revenge-bent psychopathic junkie (Tracey Walter) that he previously helped bring to justice.There's a number of truly terrific action sequences, including a breathless elevated train chase in Chicago and even more than a few genuinely laugh-out-loud funny scenes which begin as early as the opening credits when Thorson is shown to be a very transportationally-challenged driver.There's also an elegiac sense that Thorson is burned out and at the end of his career (which would be prophetic for McQueen in real life) in that he's tired and has had enough of the game. There's some thematic similarities to McQueen's own previous character of 'Tom Horn', as in both movies depict real-life historical figures, both sanctioned to use force, who made a living of tracking other men and also dealt with the ramifications of a changing society where their line of work is seen as outdated. 'The Hunter' never quite achieves the same poignancy as 'Tom Horn' before it, but Steve McQueen's amazing, fully-realized performance as Papa is more than enough to compensate. It's somewhat sad to watch as McQueen was obviously sick and weary in certain scenes, but kept going regardless ; a true testament to his acting skills. There are plenty of actors who can't convince you of who they're supposed to be when they're perfectly well ---- for McQueen to become as real in his role as he is here under the physical condition he was in at the time is nothing short of remarkable and outstanding. It's unfortunate that 'The Hunter' was Steve McQueen's final movie, but it was a fantastic note to go out on.",4,Steve McQueen's Swan Song with The Hunter,1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,3173,"['Even', '1980', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'year', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'tragic', 'untimely', 'demise', 'year', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'remembered', 'part', 'release', 'final', 'two', 'finished', 'movies', 'Horn', 'Hunter', 'are', 'best', 'films', 'course', 'truly', 'unfortunate', 'McQueen', 'died', 'too', 'early', 'career', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'make', 'legions', 'other', 'films', 'something', 'so', 'right', 'spot-on', 'characterizations', 'Tom', 'Horn', 'Ralph', 'Papa', 'Thorson', 'here', ""'The"", 'Hunter', 'difficult', 'have', 'imagined', 'better', 'more', 'fitting', 'final', 'performances', 'late', 'actor', 'who', 'died', 'suffering', 'heart', 'attack', 'Juarez', 'Mexico', 'hospital', 'following', 'surgery', 'exactly', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'today.In', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'performance', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'much', 'same', 'previous', 'role', 'character', 'inspired', 'actual', 'real-life', 'historical', 'figure', 'modern-day', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'Ralph', 'Papa', 'Thorson', 'Thorson', 'bail-enforcement', 'agent', 'bail', 'bonding', 'agency', 'headed', 'fellow', 'screen', 'legend', 'Eli', 'Wallach', 'tracking', 'down', 'various', 'fugitives', 'country', 'Not', 'nearly', 'as', 'simple', 'make', 'sound', 'here', 'riveting', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'plenty', 'action', 'also', 'extensive', 'drama', 'character', 'development', 'as', 'well', 'Not', 'only', 'Thorson', 'forced', 'contend', 'dangers', 'job', 'also', 'feelings', 'uneasiness', 'misplacement', 'modern', 'age', 'as', 'well', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'Kathryn', 'Harrold', 'exploits', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'come', 'back', 'haunt', 'as', 'lately', 'become', 'target', 'revenge-bent', 'psychopathic', 'junkie', 'Tracey', 'Walter', 'previously', 'helped', 'bring', 'justice.There', 'number', 'truly', 'terrific', 'action', 'sequences', 'including', 'breathless', 'elevated', 'train', 'chase', 'Chicago', 'even', 'more', 'few', 'genuinely', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'scenes', 'begin', 'as', 'early', 'opening', 'credits', 'when', 'Thorson', 'shown', 'be', 'very', 'transportationally-challenged', 'driver.There', 'also', 'elegiac', 'sense', 'Thorson', 'burned', 'out', 'end', 'career', 'would', 'be', 'prophetic', 'McQueen', 'real', 'life', 'tired', 'had', 'game', 'thematic', 'similarities', 'McQueen', 'own', 'previous', 'character', ""'Tom"", 'Horn', 'movies', 'depict', 'real-life', 'historical', 'figures', 'sanctioned', 'use', 'force', 'who', 'made', 'living', 'tracking', 'other', 'men', 'also', 'dealt', 'ramifications', 'changing', 'society', 'where', 'line', 'work', 'seen', 'outdated', 'Hunter', 'never', 'quite', 'same', 'poignancy', ""'Tom"", 'Horn', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'amazing', 'fully-realized', 'performance', 'Papa', 'more', 'enough', 'compensate', 'somewhat', 'sad', 'watch', 'McQueen', 'was', 'obviously', 'sick', 'weary', 'certain', 'scenes', 'kept', 'going', 'regardless', 'true', 'testament', 'acting', 'skills', 'are', 'plenty', 'actors', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'convince', 'who', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'when', ""'re"", 'perfectly', 'well', 'McQueen', 'become', 'real', 'role', 'here', 'physical', 'condition', 'was', 'time', 'nothing', 'short', 'remarkable', 'outstanding', 'unfortunate', 'Hunter', 'was', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'final', 'movie', 'was', 'fantastic', 'note', 'go', 'out']",N/A

It's not a disaster, but it's a limp effort at either a character piece, a bio, or an action movie even though it has elements of all three.The movie covers a period in the life of the real life bounty hunter (supposedly the last...) of `Papa' Thorsen.  His exploits catching various guys on the run, is contrasted with his life at home where he not only has a soft spot for lost causes, but has a beautiful wife pregnant with his child.  Some semblance of drama to drive the movie along is given by one of McQueen's ex catches getting out of jail and threatening to kill him (yawn).  McQueen tries hard to go against type and add various character touches, so we get a man who drives badly and cant park properly (an in-joke on McQueen's legendary driving skills, but taken way too far), he loves old things - vintage wind up toys, pocket watches - but with no reason other than to provide `character'.  He does not like the birth classes his wife goes to - but lo and behold turns out to be a trooper in the end... It does not entirely work - instead, we are left with a recognizable (though clearly aging) McQueen with various layers of mannerisms and affections.Supporting cast should save the day - Kathryn Harrold as the long suffering girlfriend is one of the best things in the picture.  Every now and again there is a grand entrance of a character - Ben Johnson's sheriff for example - but he then 5 minutes later vanishes without fanfare.  Only Eli Wallach hovers around for the greater part of the picture, and a youthful Levar Burton, post-Roots, pre-Star Trek The Next Generation has presence, but no reason to be there.There are a couple of interesting set pieces - the car chase in the multi storey car park, the shootout on the train - but without a plot or story to hang on, they fall flat.Steve McQueen is almost always worth a watch, but here the vehicle for once just isn't enough for the great man.

Steve is now older and a veteran of many films and it shows in his work. Years of working with Peter Yates and racing sport cars show in subtle ways as he created the true story of an American classic - the Bounty Hunter. Dating back in American western history the bounty hunters were men that had been entrusted with the return of wanted criminals for failure to appear in court on warrants past due. Not a sheriff, or a marshal, the bounty hunters were private citizens that took all the same risk and danger, but got paid per catch for the trouble. Steve McQueen is great in this role.

The story itself plays like an episode of some bad 80's cop television show. The supporting players, with the exception of Levar Burton, are underdeveloped. The direction seems somewhat muddled. But TRUE McQueen fans, such as myself, enjoy this movie for  two, simple facts: Number One: His LAST screen appearance was portraying a bounty hunter, Ralph ""Pappa"" Thorson; his FIRST major breakthrough came from playing a bounty hunter, Josh Randall on the television series ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" (1958-1961). And Number Two: Even though the film is not that good, there is still one undeniable fact: McQueen was, and still is, a STAR. You simply can't take your eyes off him.This was endemic to McQueen's career; he was better than most of his projects. Although he  appeared in 28 films, he only had a handful of ""hits"" in the mid 60's beginning with The Great Escape (1963), and ending with Bullitt (1968),(Love With The Proper Stranger, The Cincinnati Kid, Nevada Smith and The Thomas Crown Affair, were the others respectively). Even his lone Oscar nominated performance in ""The Sand Pebbles"" wasn't considered a ""Hit"". Yet he was always in demand. He was the first actor to command a million dollar paycheck because audiences just liked to watch HIM.

The movie follows his efforts to bring the bad guys in at all costs.  One of the best scenes in the movie involves Thorson chasing his man through the streets of Chicago, the subway, and then up one of the towering parking garages that border the Chicago River.  Needless to say, the chase ends with a bang.  As well, there is a subplot involving a man named Mason, a speed freak bent on getting revenge on Thorson, the man who brought him in.  Also, Thorson's girlfriend is pregnant causing him that much more problems.  The story is very enjoyable.  Even though it deals with a possibly dark subject, bounty hunting, the movie has a comedic edge in several scenes as McQueen repeatedly chases different criminals down.  Although this may not be the best movie McQueen made it is still well worth a watch.Steve McQueen is at his best in this movie even though it is obvious he is struggling with lung cancer.  You can tell he had fun with the role though as a man who refuses to let things go.  As well, his character is a horrible driver constantly hitting parked cars, driving up on sidewalks, and even destroying a Trans Am.  Considering the fact that McQueen was such a good driver makes this all that much more funny.  The film also stars Eli Wallach, Kathryn Harold as his girlfriend Dotty, Lavar Burton as Tommy Prince, a teenager Papa takes in, and a small but enjoyable role for Ben Johnson as Sheriff Strong.
