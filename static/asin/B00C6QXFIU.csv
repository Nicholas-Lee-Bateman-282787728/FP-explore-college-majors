I started with Doctor 4 played by  Tom Baker. Thank god to PBS, they ran some of the Doctors William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton and Jon Pertwee.So I saw many of these episodes in movie format. FYI-you should try to find the episode The Three Doctors which has Hartnell (his last DR WHO Appearance),, Troughton and Pertwee together. If you really want a treat try the Five Doctor's DVD special edition.The unique thing about this collection is the choice the viewer has in regards to watching these episodes.You have a choice of  movie format (98 minute movie) or original four episodes. Foe the Doctor fan is is a nice keepsake, Never the less it is just the episodes.The one problem I miss is on the original DVD of these episodes there are audio commentary,  interviews and other extras. This package has none of the single DVD goodies. You also have a mini documentary like it ran on BBC America of the Doctor Revisited. A 30 minutes film  explaining the different  doctor and his companionsIs it worth getting? For the low price and having an episode of each of the four doctors,, it is! For me, I like the extras, so this set as good as it is, isnt what I would buy.

1642881,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B00C6QXFIU,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[2, 2]","To celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Doctor Who, BBC Home Entertainment is releasing the best serial from each of the eleven Doctors. The first release features the first four Doctors, William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee, and Tom Baker, from the years 1963-1981, each in one classic episode, The Aztecs, Tomb of the Cybermen, The Spearhead From Space, and Pyramids of Mars.My introduction into the world of Doctor Who was when the episode ""Rose"" aired on the Sci Fi Channel (now known as SyFy) in the spring of 2006. I was aware of the previous series that aired from 1963-1989, but I had never watched an episode before, though I had watched the Peter Cushing's version, Doctor Who and the Daleks and Daleks - Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D., so I was eager to watch the four-disc set, which I received free of charge from BBC Entertainment in exchange for my honest review.Each episode can be watched in its original four-part version or as a feature presentation with an introduction by Steven Moffat. For a bonus, there is a profile special on each doctor.The Aztecs stars William Hartnell as a grumpy version of the Doctor, who travels across time in the TARDIS with his granddaughter, Susan Foreman, and their companions, Barbra and Ian. They arrive in the 15th Century Mexico, where the TARDIS get trapped inside a tomb. Barbara gets mistaken for the reincarnation of High Priest Yetaxa by the Aztecs, so she has no other choice but to assume the high priest role, but the High Priest of Sacrifice, Tlotoxl, is not fooled by her arrival and demands a sacrifice to be made.The Tomb of the Cybermen stars Patrick Troughton as the second Doctor. The serial is currently the only intact serial from Troughton's first two seasons. Along for the adventure are his two companions, Watling and Victoria. The TARDIS lands on the planet Telos, where archeologists have uncovered a secret entrance in a mountain, which is the remains of the Doctor's enemy, the Cybermen, are located. Everything is fine, until the Cybermen are unleashed from their prison cells.There are several big firsts in the serial Spearhead From Space, as it is the first of the series to be broadcast in color, it is the first full episode with Jon Pertwee playing the Doctor, and it introduces the new villain, the Autons. After being regenerated and exiled to Earth by the Time Lords, the Doctor is recruited by UNIT to help stop an alien invasion.Tom Baker stars as the scarf-wearing Doctor in Pyramids of Mars along with his companion, Sarah Jane Smith. The TARDIS lands near the Scarman family home in England, now owned by an Egyptian, Ibrahim Namin, who can command mummy robots from their tombs by using a powerful ring. The Doctor and Sarah Jane stumble upon something more sinister than the mummies; it seems an upright sarcophagus is actually a space-time portal, where the last of the alien race Osirian, named Sutekh, is waiting to end all life.Similar to the original Star Trek series, the early years of Doctor Who had low-budget sets and special effects. I never knew the first doctor was grumpy and somewhat clueless at times. He wastes most of his time flirting with an Aztec woman, when he could have been helping Barbra. The Cybermen's suits are silly, but they are still fun to watch as the second doctor tries to stop them. The Spearhead From Space is my favorite out of the four as it introduces the Autons who later appear in ""Rose"" and the Doctor is forced to stay on Earth. I know the fourth doctor is a fan favorite, but the plot in Pyramids of Mars is a little silly, though the Doctor's chemistry with Sarah Jane makes up for it. Overall, I had a blast watching the origins of Doctor Who and I recommend it to old or new fans.",5,Travel in the TARDIS with the Original Four Doctors,1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,3732,"['celebrate', '50th', 'Anniversary', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'BBC', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'releasing', 'best', 'serial', 'eleven', 'Doctors', 'first', 'release', 'first', 'four', 'Doctors', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'Jon', 'Pertwee', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'years', '1963-1981', 'one', 'classic', 'episode', 'Aztecs', 'Tomb', 'Cybermen', 'Spearhead', 'From', 'Space', 'Pyramids', 'Mars.My', 'introduction', 'world', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'was', 'when', 'episode', 'Rose', 'aired', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Channel', 'now', 'known', 'SyFy', 'spring', '2006', 'was', 'aware', 'previous', 'series', 'aired', '1963-1989', 'had', 'never', 'watched', 'episode', 'had', 'watched', 'Peter', 'Cushing', 'version', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Daleks', 'Daleks', 'Invasion', 'Earth', '2150', 'A.D.', 'was', 'eager', 'watch', 'four-disc', 'set', 'received', 'free', 'charge', 'BBC', 'Entertainment', 'exchange', 'honest', 'review.Each', 'episode', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'original', 'four-part', 'version', 'feature', 'presentation', 'introduction', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'bonus', 'profile', 'special', 'doctor.The', 'Aztecs', 'William', 'Hartnell', 'grumpy', 'version', 'Doctor', 'who', 'time', 'TARDIS', 'granddaughter', 'Susan', 'Foreman', 'companions', 'Barbra', 'Ian', 'arrive', '15th', 'Century', 'Mexico', 'where', 'TARDIS', 'get', 'trapped', 'tomb', 'Barbara', 'mistaken', 'reincarnation', 'High', 'Priest', 'Yetaxa', 'Aztecs', 'other', 'choice', 'assume', 'high', 'priest', 'role', 'High', 'Priest', 'Sacrifice', 'Tlotoxl', 'not', 'fooled', 'arrival', 'sacrifice', 'be', 'made.The', 'Tomb', 'Cybermen', 'stars', 'Patrick', 'Troughton', 'second', 'Doctor', 'serial', 'currently', 'only', 'intact', 'serial', 'Troughton', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'adventure', 'are', 'two', 'companions', 'Watling', 'Victoria', 'TARDIS', 'planet', 'Telos', 'where', 'archeologists', 'have', 'uncovered', 'secret', 'entrance', 'mountain', 'remains', 'Doctor', 'enemy', 'Cybermen', 'are', 'located', 'Everything', 'fine', 'Cybermen', 'are', 'unleashed', 'prison', 'are', 'several', 'big', 'firsts', 'serial', 'Spearhead', 'From', 'Space', 'first', 'series', 'be', 'broadcast', 'color', 'first', 'full', 'episode', 'Jon', 'Pertwee', 'playing', 'Doctor', 'new', 'villain', 'Autons', 'being', 'regenerated', 'exiled', 'Earth', 'Time', 'Lords', 'Doctor', 'recruited', 'UNIT', 'help', 'stop', 'alien', 'invasion.Tom', 'Baker', 'scarf-wearing', 'Doctor', 'Pyramids', 'Mars', 'companion', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'Smith', 'TARDIS', 'Scarman', 'family', 'home', 'England', 'now', 'owned', 'Egyptian', 'Ibrahim', 'Namin', 'who', 'can', 'command', 'mummy', 'robots', 'tombs', 'using', 'powerful', 'ring', 'Doctor', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'stumble', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'mummies', 'upright', 'sarcophagus', 'actually', 'space-time', 'portal', 'where', 'last', 'alien', 'race', 'Osirian', 'named', 'Sutekh', 'waiting', 'end', 'life.Similar', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'early', 'years', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'had', 'low-budget', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'never', 'knew', 'first', 'doctor', 'was', 'grumpy', 'somewhat', 'clueless', 'times', 'most', 'time', 'flirting', 'Aztec', 'woman', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'helping', 'Barbra', 'Cybermen', 'suits', 'are', 'silly', 'are', 'still', 'fun', 'watch', 'second', 'doctor', 'tries', 'stop', 'Spearhead', 'From', 'Space', 'favorite', 'four', 'Autons', 'who', 'later', 'appear', 'Rose', 'Doctor', 'forced', 'stay', 'Earth', 'know', 'fourth', 'doctor', 'fan', 'favorite', 'plot', 'Pyramids', 'Mars', 'little', 'silly', 'Doctor', 'chemistry', 'Sarah', 'Jane', 'up', 'Overall', 'had', 'blast', 'watching', 'origins', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'recommend', 'old', 'new', 'fans']",Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited First-Fourth

1642885,A1EQ35NR4CZL6Y,B00C6QXFIU,Dmarkwind,"[4, 4]","This four-disk set goes through the first four actors who played The Doctor with a half-hour documentary on each and then one representative episode from each. Very interesting stuff as I hadn't realized how much the show has evolved over the years. The first doctor, William Hartnell, wasn't especially likeable or ""nice"" and I'm surprised the show survived him. His first companions were his granddaughter (they have yet to explain that family tree) and a pair of school teachers he basically kidnapped. The male teacher ended up being the action hero of the piece and the Doctor was just this doddering old weirdo kind of off to the side. The second Doctor, Patrick Troughton, was where he really became the center of his own show and it started to hit its stride. I had seen some shows featuring third Doctor Jon Pertwee but didn't realize that the setup for his years was very different than for any of the other Doctors. His backstory is that the Time Lords bascially stranded him on earth and forced him to work as scientific advisor to UNIT. So for his shows, all the monsters and villains basically come to him (or to earth) instead of him running around the cosmos and falling into adventures, as he did before and since. For his shows, he used a whole series of earth vehicles like cars and helicopters and even carried a gun some of the time. My starting point for the series was Fourth Doctor Tom Baker, who is interviewed here and is still among my favorites because he's so British, at times manic, and usually very alien. The episode they use for Baker's years was The Pyramids of Mars, which is one of the first I ever saw. Like James Bond (who also has the 50th anniversary of his series coming up soon), this character has been played by many actors, but unlike the British spy, the Doctor's personality changes almost completely with each actor.

If you have been buying the single releases of the Doctor Who DVD's, this is more of the same. There are no 'behind the scenes' features, but they do have the interviews with some of the new show's cast and crew that aired on BBC America. Also, each of the 4 stories are presented as the way they were originally aired (broken into parts) and also in the form of one long story (opening and closing credits edited out).The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is due to the fact, if you already have these four stories as individual releases, you are not really gaining much other than the short interviews from their BBC America airing, with David Tennant and Steven Moffat being the main people in the chair. However, Disc 4, 'Pyramids of Mars' does have a few moments with Tom Baker in the interview chair.

1642891,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B00C6QXFIU,Happy Reader,"[68, 73]","2013 is the 50th Anniversary of ""Doctor Who"". In this 4-disc DVD set, each Doctor has a celebratory documentary/Special looking back on his tenure.  There are interviews, photos and clips from various series. Each special is followed by a favorite series for that Doctor, including a special introduction by Steven Moffat (current Dr. Who Showrunner and Lead Writer).Fans like me, who have been purchasing each series as it comes out on DVD, will probably not need to buy this DVD set. (Though I did watch all the specials on TV.) But if you are wondering just what all the excitement is about, this will be a good introduction to the first four of the Classic Doctor Who's.1st DOCTOR - WILLIAM HARTNELL (1963-1966)Commentators: Steven Moffat, David Tennant (10th doctor), Neil Gaiman (writer, wrote ""The Doctor's Wife"" series), William Russell (plays Ian, one of the first companions), Caroline Skinner (executive producer), Peter Purves (plays Steve Taylor, in Hartnell's 2nd group of companions) and John Barrowman (plays Captain Jack Harkness in ""Dr. Who"" and ""Torchwood"").The Daleks are the 1st aliens Doctor Who encounters. It isn't until their 2nd appearance, however, that they invade Earth, and the Doctor goes proactive in protecting Earth. Tennant points out: The Daleks ""became almost bigger than the show that spawned them. ... Brilliant design [on a] ridiculously small budget.""But the series picked to showcase the first Doctor has no alien opponent. It is one of the historical series, where Doctor Who visits different time periods on Earth. The special is followed by the series, ""The Aztecs"" (1964), four episodes of 25 minutes each:The TARDIS lands in the tomb of an Aztec priest. On her own, Barbara goes through a door, which closes behind her. An angry priest cries, ""Woman! ... You trespass and must be punished!""  Fortunately, Barbara is wearing a snake bracelet taken from the tomb. What do you know? Believing the tomb to be permanently sealed, the only way she could have gotten the bracelet is if she is the god Yetaxa, returned to her people.When Yetaxa is to preside over a human sacrifice, Barbara determines to use her position to halt this Aztec practice. The Doctor is angry, but cannot convince her to leave history as it is.Nothing works out the way Barbara expects. Even the man who was to be sacrificed is not grateful. ""You have denied me honor,"" he tells her, before flinging himself off the top of the temple to his death. So if the first theme of the serial is SHOULD we change history?, the second theme is CAN we change history? In addition, they've made an enemy out of a priest, and he determines to get rid of them all, god or no.2nd DOCTOR  -  PATRICK TROUGHTON (1966-1969)Commentators include Steven Moffat, David Tennant, Wendy Padbury (plays companion Zoe Heriot), Neil Gaiman, Frazer Hines (plays companion Jamie McCrimmon), John Barrowman and Caroline Skinner.Moffat says that when Matt Smith was trying to figure out his Doctor, Patrick Troughton is the version he fell in love with.This special is followed by the series ""The Tomb of the Cybermen"" (1967), four episodes of 25 minutes each:A group of archeologists set to blow the face off a cliff. The leader says, ""According to the map reference, that should be the entrance to the City of Telos""; the planet and city of Telos, home of the supposedly extinct Cybermen.Everybody cheers when giant doors are revealed, framed by the images of Cybermen. But the first man to try to open the doors is electrocuted. That's when the Doctor, Jamie, and Victoria arrive. The Doctor deactivates the doors, and everyone troops in, the Doctor fretting about additional booby-traps. But there's not just possible Cyberman traps to worry about. Someone on the expedition is ready to kill people, too. To what purpose, though?The sequences with the five-story Cyberman tomb are outstanding. This is an example of how black & white can be effective, evocative and chilling. The long shot of awakened Cybermen climbing down the ladders on each side, drums and horns banging in the background, is fantastic.3rd DOCTOR  -  JON PERTWEE (1970-1974)Commentators include David Tennant, Steven Moffat, Caroline Skinner, Camille Coduri (plays Jacki Tyler, Rose's Mom), Hugh Bonneville (plays Captain Avery, and the Earl of Grantham on Downton Abbey), Adam Garcia (plays Alex Klein), Richard Franklin (plays UNIT Captain Mike Yates) and John Barrowman.Bonneville grins as he says, ""You could almost touch the velvet that he was wearing. And the ruched shirt. It was Tom Jones in drama. It was extraordinary.""Pertwee's Doctor was such a change from Troughton, and not only because he was nattily dressed. He also was different because of his physicality. As the narrator says, ""This was the only Doctor who saved the world with fast cars and fist fights.""Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart becomes a recurring character. I've never thought of him as an authoritarian military type, perhaps because I did not ""discover"" Doctor Who until I was an adult. Moffat capsulizes my feelings well, ""In lesser hands than Nicholas Courtney's, the Brigadier would have been such a boring character - he really is a sort of military blimp. Instead, [they] cast a man who cannot play a line without twinkling.""This special is followed by the series ""Spearhead From Space"" (1970), four 25-minute episodes:The Doctor has just regenerated and isn't well. He's captured by U.N.I.T. and taken to the hospital. Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart has more than Doctor Who on his mind, though. Especially since he doesn't recognize the Doctor, given his new appearance.Earth is being bombarded by strange meteorites, and an ex-employee of a plastics manufacturer claims that he's seen a walking mannequin. Aha! These two things are related, and it takes the recovered Doctor to figure it out.This is the first time in Dr. Who history that it is revealed that Time Lords have two hearts and blood incompatible with humans. It is also the first Doctor Who that was totally produced in color! Mannequins coming to life, bursting through department store windows to attack hapless shoppers - great stuff!4th DOCTOR  -  TOM BAKER (1974-1981)Commentators include Tom Baker (the 4th Doctor), David Tennant, Steven Moffat, Marcus Wilson (producer), Louise Jameson (plays Leela), Nicholas Briggs (voice of the Daleks), Neil Gaiman and John Leeson (voice of K9).David Tennant: ""I think the casting of Tom Baker was one of those moments when the absolute right fit for something is found.""Tom Baker is only saying what many fans believe when he says, ""When I became Doctor Who, I didn't play Doctor Who, I WAS Doctor Who..... There was no acting involved at all.""The famous scarf? Baker says, ""The scarf was a happy accident. Jim brought a truck load of wool and sent it down to a woman, called Begonia Pope. She just used up all the wool! She just kept knitting!""This special is followed by the series ""Pyramids of Mars"" (1975), four 25-minute episodes:The Doctor is bored and Sarah Jane cannot cheer him up. Then, the TARDIS gives a huge jolt and they're pulled off course. They land in 1911, in a Victorian mansion's room full of Egyptian coffins. The Doctor says, ""Something's going contrary to the rules of the universe."" This cheers him up no end and they go exploring.In a different part of the house, Namen, wearing a dapper fez, is playing appropriately spooky music on a huge organ. The butler, Collins, interrupts. This is the house of the archeologist, Professor Marcus Scarman. His old friend Dr. Warlock insists that Namen tell him where the apparently disappeared Professor has gone to.Namen intones, ""I have brought back from Egypt all the relics discovered by the Professor on his recent expedition.... There are ancient powers gathering in this place.""Then they find Collins strangled, Namen shoots Warlock in the shoulder, and the Doctor and Sarah help Warlock escape. The Professor has a brother, Laurence, and they make their way to his house. In the meantime, Namen opens one of the Egyptian coffins, flashes a ring with a giant green stone, and the mummy walks!What is the organ music summoning?  Why does Laurence's Marconiscope go wild when it's pointed at Mars? And just who is Sutekh the Destroyer? I'll give you a hint of the plot: Once again, the Doctor must save the world.NOTE: In promotional blurbs, the documentaries of each Doctor are described as being 40 minutes each. When I've timed them on my cable's OnDemand, though, they've been of varying shorter lengths. Give or take a minute, the Specials for the four Doctors in this set, including commercials and Moffat's special introduction, range from 32 to 36 minutes each.ADDED LATER:For the other 50th

1642892,A2DDBYKXF1N0D5,B00C6QXFIU,Jero Briggs,"[0, 0]","I loved this DVD set. You've got 25-minute documentaries on each Doctor (#1, 2, 3 & 4), an introduction by Steven Moffatt at the beginning of each adventure, and each story has a feature-length version included with this set as well as the original 4-part versions.First you have ""The Aztecs"" with Doctor #1 William Hartnell. Although ""The Aztecs"" wasn't one of Hartnell's better stories, I still found it enjoyable to say the least. It's also one of the few historical stories that still exists, and it explores the idea of altering history for the first time in the show. Ian's final battle with Ixta was exciting and very well shot and edited, and it does have some great drama in it. I love Barbara's character in this one; the dilemmas she faced in this story were quite moving. I just wished they had a little bit more action in this one. Four starsNext is the classic ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" with Doctor #2 Patrick Troughton. Certainly one of the best second Doctor stories which was quite eerie and thrilling. The sets are spectacular, the Cybermen are very creepy, the lighting is moody as well as the incidental music, it's action-packed with some great acting. Five starsThen we have ""Spearhead from Space"" with Doctor #3 Jon Pertwee. The first television Doctor Who to be made in color, this eerie and action-packed story is written by the great Robert Holmes and introduces the Autons for the first time. Five starsLast we have ""Pyramids of Mars"" with the great Doctor #4 Tom Baker. Although Tom's Doctor isn't as humorous in this one as he is in a lot of his other stories, this is a great story with lots of suspense, an all-star cast, great visuals, and some good eerie moments in it. This is kind of a dark story which is probably why Tom's more serious in this one, but Tom Baker's acting is superb as always, and he does find a scene here and there where he adds some nice humor into the piece. Co-written by Robert Holmes, I think any Whovian can enjoy this one.

Don't get me wrong, I love listening to Tennant and his admiration for his fore-bearers, but this series would have been better served to have old interviews with the original Doctors 1,2 and 3. At least we got to hear from Tom Baker, but again, not enough. Clearly it is all about fawning all over the mythos of the series by present company. I would also like to have Matt in on the discussion too.Then to make matters worse, they used a copy of The Aztecs that was completely unwatchable. The Tomb of the Cybermen had the awful hum that seems to accompany many of the earlier episodes. (some of course due to the soundtrack as a result of a fan made recording from their TV set). Also a lame choice for Tom Baker's episode was shown. Genesis of the Daleks would have been insurmountable.If this kind of celebration continues, the 50th anniversary will fade into the past as those that were never officially celebrated by television specials at all.",3,not compatible it must be deleted,1367452800,"05 2, 2013",2013,1049,"['Dr', 'No', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'menagerie', 'kudos', 'Steven', 'Moffat', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'love', 'listening', 'Tennant', 'admiration', 'fore-bearers', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'have', 'old', 'interviews', 'original', 'Doctors', '1,2', '3', 'least', 'got', 'hear', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'again', 'not', 'enough', 'Clearly', 'fawning', 'mythos', 'series', 'present', 'company', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'have', 'Matt', 'discussion', 'too.Then', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'used', 'copy', 'Aztecs', 'was', 'completely', 'unwatchable', 'Tomb', 'Cybermen', 'had', 'awful', 'hum', 'accompany', 'many', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'course', 'due', 'soundtrack', 'result', 'fan', 'made', 'recording', 'TV', 'set', 'Also', 'lame', 'choice', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'episode', 'was', 'shown', 'Genesis', 'Daleks', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'insurmountable.If', 'kind', 'celebration', '50th', 'anniversary', 'will', 'fade', 'past', 'were', 'never', 'officially', 'celebrated', 'television', 'specials']",Doctor Who: The Doctors Revisited First-Fourth
