She's no kind of actress but she is often surrounded by a fine supporting cast which make her films worthwhile. In this case, it's Cesar Romero as a night club performer who, along with the rest of the cast, is trying to save an old hotel from the wrecking ball. He is absolutely hilarious (even by today's standards). Good big band music by Woody Herman and the always beautiful Carole Landis appears in one of her last films. This (and currently none of her other films) is not available on DVD.",3,Cesar Romero - gotta love him!,1216252800,"07 17, 2008",2008,591,"['must', 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'Sonja', 'Henie', 'fan', 'always', 'MEN', 'movies', 'kind', 'actress', 'often', 'surrounded', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'make', 'films', 'worthwhile', 'case', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'night', 'club', 'performer', 'who', 'rest', 'cast', 'trying', 'save', 'old', 'hotel', 'wrecking', 'ball', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'even', 'today', 'standards', 'Good', 'big', 'band', 'music', 'Woody', 'Herman', 'always', 'beautiful', 'Carole', 'Landis', 'one', 'last', 'films', 'currently', 'none', 'other', 'films', 'not', 'available', 'DVD']",Wintertime VHS

349392,ACO20QL72D1E6,6302989736,"Henning Sebastian Jahre ""Judy-Viv""","[6, 7]","By 1942 Sonja Henie made two more films for Fox....Darryl F Zanuck(head of Fox) and Sonja hated each others guts and he was so sure he was making his last film with her, when Sun Valley Serenade 1941 became a box-office champion:-)He had even sold the icerink to Republic, so they had to freeze a smaller dancing area for her last two films.Thus her space in both Iceland and Wintertime 1942 are relatively smaller than in the other films...But why didn`t they connect? Well for starters, Sonja was an athlete and had finished her celebrated career in the world of sports... It had made her a tough cookie....Zanuck had risen from screen writing to become a producer who eventually became head of 20th Century in 1933 -  bought out Fox 1935 - which in turn became a new studio - 20th Century-Fox....They looked for new talent and stars of their own and Sonja was already a supertar of the ice...He tried to let her do a featured part..... No no no---- she wouldn`t have it.... why should she? Carry the burden of other stars? She was already a legend in her own time....Eventually he relented and gave her a leading lady contract, but she was used to getting her way---- and so was he.....Even so... back to focus....Even so...Sonja turned her best skating and best acting performances in Sun Valley, Iceland and especially Wintertime...In this one her comic timing shines through the whole picture....  she is relaxed and in this she shows an actress at work.Her skating is also at her best... artistic.... and really showcases her as Queen of The Ice:-)",4,Sonja`s best as actress,1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,1555,"['1942', 'Sonja', 'Henie', 'made', 'two', 'more', 'films', 'Fox', '.Darryl', 'F', 'Zanuck', 'head', 'Fox', 'Sonja', 'hated', 'others', 'guts', 'was', 'so', 'sure', 'was', 'making', 'last', 'film', 'when', 'Sun', 'Valley', 'Serenade', '1941', 'became', 'box-office', 'champion', 'had', 'even', 'sold', 'icerink', 'Republic', 'had', 'freeze', 'smaller', 'dancing', 'area', 'last', 'two', 'films.Thus', 'space', 'Iceland', 'Wintertime', '1942', 'are', 'relatively', 'smaller', 'other', 'films', 'why', 'didn', 't', 'connect', 'Well', 'starters', 'Sonja', 'was', 'athlete', 'had', 'finished', 'her', 'celebrated', 'career', 'world', 'sports', 'had', 'made', 'tough', 'cookie', '.Zanuck', 'had', 'risen', 'screen', 'writing', 'become', 'producer', 'who', 'eventually', 'became', 'head', '20th', 'Century', '1933', 'bought', 'out', 'Fox', '1935', 'turn', 'became', 'new', 'studio', '20th', 'Century-Fox', '.They', 'looked', 'new', 'talent', 'stars', 'own', 'Sonja', 'was', 'already', 'supertar', 'ice', 'tried', 'let', 'do', 'featured', 'part', 'wouldn', 't', 'have', 'why', 'should', 'Carry', 'burden', 'other', 'stars', 'was', 'already', 'legend', 'own', 'time', '.Eventually', 'relented', 'gave', 'leading', 'lady', 'contract', 'was', 'used', 'getting', 'way', 'so', 'was', '..Even', 'back', 'focus', '.Even', 'so', 'Sonja', 'turned', 'best', 'skating', 'best', 'acting', 'performances', 'Sun', 'Valley', 'Iceland', 'especially', 'Wintertime', 'one', 'comic', 'timing', 'shines', 'whole', 'picture', 'relaxed', 'actress', 'work.Her', 'skating', 'also', 'best', 'artistic', 'really', 'Queen', 'Ice']",Wintertime VHS

Her skating is awesome.  Credit goes largely to Alfred Newman who was head of the 20th Century Fox musical department for putting his brother Emil in charge of scoring the choreography of this film as well as &#34;Sun Valley Serenade&#34; and the anemic &#34;Iceland&#34;.
