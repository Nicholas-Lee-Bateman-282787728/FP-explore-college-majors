1623103,A4PTUEVFE13K6,B00B81NPPM,Allen Chapman,"[37, 39]","""Stevie Nicks ~ Through The Looking Glass"" is a surprisingly well done documentary on the career of Stevie Nicks. It covers the years 1966 until 2013. Along the way a ton of vintage video clips, interviews and performances, and photos are shown. New interviews are done with producer Keith Olsen, Rick Vito, Ken Caillet and a few others. Stevie herself is shown in archive interview footage. For the most part this is a good overview of her career, if you're a long time fan you won't learn anything new really, but it's a worth a look. It's two hours long, but the first hour alone covers the albums ""Buckingham Nicks"" thru ""Tusk"" (1973-1979). The next 55mins cover ""Bella Donna"" thru ""Street Angel"" (1981-1994) and the last five minutes brings us up to day very quickly. It's done better than expected and the vintage footage (most of which is probably out on YouTube) is a plus.",4,A decent overview of Stevie's career,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,881,"['Stevie', 'Nicks', '~', 'Looking', 'Glass', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'done', 'documentary', 'career', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'years', '1966', '2013', 'way', 'ton', 'vintage', 'video', 'clips', 'interviews', 'performances', 'photos', 'are', 'shown', 'New', 'interviews', 'are', 'done', 'producer', 'Keith', 'Olsen', 'Rick', 'Vito', 'Ken', 'Caillet', 'few', 'others', 'Stevie', 'shown', 'archive', 'interview', 'footage', 'most', 'part', 'good', 'overview', 'career', ""'re"", 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'wo', ""n't"", 'learn', 'anything', 'new', 'really', 'worth', 'look', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'first', 'hour', 'alone', 'albums', 'Buckingham', 'Nicks', 'thru', 'Tusk', '1973-1979', 'next', '55mins', 'cover', 'Bella', 'Donna', 'thru', 'Street', 'Angel', '1981-1994', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'brings', 'up', 'day', 'very', 'quickly', 'done', 'better', 'expected', 'vintage', 'footage', 'most', 'probably', 'out', 'YouTube', 'plus']",Stevie Nicks: Through the Looking Glass

1623106,AHXYY7G09V1X9,B00B81NPPM,Glenn M. Mcclain,"[2, 3]",The video follows Stevie Nicks from her early years in the music business through the present time.  Most of the emphasis is on her time spent with Fleetwood Mac especially the recording of the Rumours album.  Some very nice film footage from throughout her career is included.  Very little music although snippets of her musical work is played.  Some wonderful commentaries during this show that give insight into motivating factors that influenced Stevie's art.  I enjoyed this and will view it again.

1623110,A3Q7WD99GQ3AJC,B00B81NPPM,"Timothy K. Schwader ""@impalerspeaks""","[0, 0]","As a longtime fan of Stevie Nicks, I found &#8216;Through The Looking Glass&#8217; to be an entertaining and predominantly satisfying film. The archival footage, much of which I&#8217;d never seen or at least hadn&#8217;t seen in ages and did not previously have immediate access to via a DVD such as this, includes some real gems in the form of interviews, live performances, and behind-the-scenes video clips. Likewise, much of the music utilized is from live performances, showcasing some amazing moments from Nicks&#8217; storied career. I note all of this, as I stated above, as a fan. For me, Stevie Nicks is basically untouchable, a paradigm of classic rock perfection whose work I&#8217;ve treasured for over thirty years now. And I am compelled to note my personal feelings for the artistry of Stevie Nicks to clarify my overall satisfaction with this film despite its flaws, which must be addressed in any fair assessment of the finished work. Inexplicably, the filmmakers utilized a format that attempted to recap Nicks&#8217; thirty-plus year career with a narrative delivered in present tense, i.e. &#8216;Nicks and Buckingham join the band at this point and then&#8230;&#8217; and so forth. The mixed-bag of &#8216;experts&#8217; chosen to present the story created an even bigger challenge for me. Not only did they fall into the trap of attempting to use present tense &#8211; failing often, with rambling sentences that veered through as many as five tenses in the course of one brief tale &#8211; but their actual expertise and ability to provide insightful information ranged from &#8216;adequate&#8217; at best (&#8216;Uncut&#8217; magazine&#8217;s Nigel Williamson and record producer Ken Caillat) to &#8216;so far removed from adequate that it was actually offensive to hear them speak&#8217; (the overly smug yet clearly out of her element Ann Powers, whose misguided attempts to classify both Nicks as a person and the meaning behind her songs with a misapplied coat of mid-90s Lilith Fair style feminism that is, in itself, out of date and out of touch, was painful to endure and utterly pointless), with strangely chosen segments from contributors who certainly do know that of which they speak but who offered little of substance here (the &#8216;dean of American rock critics&#8217; Robert Christgau, who clearly detests both Stevie Nicks and Fleetwood Mac, making his inclusion in the project puzzling; the overly conceited record producer Keith Olsen, who similarly marred the otherwise brilliant documentary on famed studio Sound City, where both the Buckingham-Nicks album and the Fleetwood Mac classic &#8216;Rumors&#8217; were recorded). Additionally, the majority of this 2-hour documentary focused more on Fleetwood Mac as a whole than on Stevie Nicks as a person or as a performer; only the final 30 minutes (at best) was devoted to Nicks&#8217; solo career, with the past decade or so covered in a blurry 90-second haze and the entirety of it essentially slagged off as unnecessary by the less-than-astute talking heads employed to provide commentary. Again, as a fan of Stevie Nicks &#8211; to the level of being someone who really would have to make an effort NOT to enjoy pretty much anything she does &#8211; I did enjoy &#8216;Through The Looking Glass&#8217;, and I recommend it to anyone who shares my level of enjoyment of Nicks&#8217; music, if only for the treasure trove of archival video and audio collected therein.",4,Worthwhile If Uneven,1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,3466,"['longtime', 'fan', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'found', '8216', 'Looking', 'Glass', '8217', 'be', 'entertaining', 'predominantly', 'satisfying', 'film', 'archival', 'footage', 'much', '8217', 'never', 'seen', 'least', 'hadn', '8217', 'seen', 'ages', 'did', 'not', 'previously', 'have', 'immediate', 'access', 'DVD', 'such', 'real', 'gems', 'form', 'interviews', 'live', 'performances', 'behind-the-scenes', 'video', 'clips', 'Likewise', 'much', 'music', 'utilized', 'live', 'performances', 'showcasing', 'amazing', 'moments', 'Nicks', '8217', 'storied', 'career', 'note', 'stated', 'above', 'fan', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'basically', 'untouchable', 'paradigm', 'classic', 'rock', 'perfection', 'work', '8217', 've', 'treasured', 'thirty', 'years', 'now', 'am', 'compelled', 'note', 'personal', 'feelings', 'artistry', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'clarify', 'overall', 'satisfaction', 'film', 'flaws', 'must', 'be', 'addressed', 'fair', 'assessment', 'finished', 'work', 'Inexplicably', 'filmmakers', 'utilized', 'format', 'attempted', 'recap', 'Nicks', '8217', 'thirty-plus', 'year', 'career', 'narrative', 'delivered', 'present', 'tense', 'i.e', '8216', 'Nicks', 'Buckingham', 'join', 'band', 'point', 'then', '8230', '8217', 'so', 'forth', 'mixed-bag', '8216', 'experts', '8217', 'chosen', 'present', 'story', 'created', 'even', 'bigger', 'challenge', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'fall', 'trap', 'attempting', 'use', 'present', 'tense', '8211', 'failing', 'often', 'rambling', 'sentences', 'veered', 'as', 'many', 'five', 'tenses', 'course', 'one', 'brief', 'tale', '8211', 'actual', 'expertise', 'ability', 'provide', 'insightful', 'information', 'ranged', '8216', 'adequate', '8217', 'best', '8216', 'Uncut', '8217', 'magazine', '8217', 'Nigel', 'Williamson', 'record', 'producer', 'Ken', 'Caillat', '8216', 'so', 'far', 'removed', 'adequate', 'was', 'actually', 'offensive', 'hear', 'speak', '8217', 'overly', 'smug', 'yet', 'clearly', 'element', 'Ann', 'Powers', 'misguided', 'attempts', 'classify', 'Nicks', 'person', 'meaning', 'songs', 'misapplied', 'coat', 'mid-90s', 'Lilith', 'Fair', 'style', 'feminism', 'date', 'touch', 'was', 'painful', 'endure', 'utterly', 'pointless', 'strangely', 'chosen', 'segments', 'contributors', 'who', 'certainly', 'do', 'know', 'speak', 'who', 'offered', 'little', 'substance', 'here', '8216', 'dean', 'American', 'rock', 'critics', '8217', 'Robert', 'Christgau', 'who', 'clearly', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'making', 'inclusion', 'project', 'puzzling', 'overly', 'conceited', 'record', 'producer', 'Keith', 'Olsen', 'who', 'similarly', 'marred', 'otherwise', 'brilliant', 'documentary', 'famed', 'studio', 'Sound', 'City', 'where', 'Buckingham-Nicks', 'album', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'classic', '8216', 'Rumors', '8217', 'were', 'recorded', 'Additionally', 'majority', '2-hour', 'documentary', 'focused', 'more', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'whole', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'person', 'performer', 'only', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'best', 'was', 'devoted', 'Nicks', '8217', 'career', 'past', 'decade', 'so', 'covered', 'blurry', '90-second', 'haze', 'entirety', 'essentially', 'slagged', 'off', 'unnecessary', 'less-than-astute', 'talking', 'heads', 'employed', 'provide', 'commentary', 'Again', 'fan', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', '8211', 'level', 'being', 'someone', 'who', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'make', 'effort', 'NOT', 'enjoy', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', '8211', 'did', 'enjoy', '8216', 'Looking', 'Glass', '8217', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'shares', 'level', 'enjoyment', 'Nicks', '8217', 'music', 'only', 'treasure', 'trove', 'archival', 'video', 'audio', 'collected', 'therein']",Stevie Nicks: Through the Looking Glass
