She plays Aicha Ahman, a rebellious Copenhagen high school senior who nurses a passion for mixed martial arts. With her strict Turkish parents expecting her to attend medical school, Aicha instead begins to sneak away to train at her stern sifu's (Xian Gao, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON)local kung fu club. In an unforgiving sport in which women are regarded as secondary citizens, are her skills enough for her to defy expectations and surmount gender bias? In a world where cultures clash as resoundingly as any cage combat, can Aicha bust thru long-held preconceptions? Except that a few moments spent with her lets us know she's not the pragmatic sort. Aicha thrives on the strength of her conviction. She husbands the hell out of her independent streak. We recognize at some level that her pursuit of martial arts also serves as a metaphor for her search for self-identity. I've always dug that metaphor. Self-expression thru ki-yaaaaahh!FIGHTER, a 2007 Danish martial arts drama, carries whiffs of GIRLFIGHT and BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, and yet I wasn't expecting much going into it. So it's surprising how caught up I got with this indie film. FIGHTER doesn't sacrifice narrative for the sake of action. And while I wish there were more fighty fights, when they did come around Semra Turan, a real-life martial arts champion, convinces with her strong moves. Xian Gao not only acts but concocts the film's fight choreography and he wisely complements it to Semra Turan's style.Semra handles her business with the acting bits as well. New to cinema, she brings a rawness which actually lends believability to her performance. You'll find yourself easily connecting with her. You root for her to find a measure of balance with her aspirations and with her heritage. You root for the low key romance she sort of falls into. You definitely root for her when she competes in a mixed sexes fight tournament. FIGHTER is gritty and introspective and the pace is of the slow burn sort. But it rewards the patient viewer. It's a martial arts flick fleshed out by a thoughtful coming-of-age theme. It deserved a wider audience that it received. I'm clamoring for more movies featuring Semra Turan. What do you say?

1270618,A3GN5X5BEMG0QK,B002IRYYCS,Jedd,"[0, 0]","""Fighter"" is a richly meaningful film.  Of course, it would appeal to anyone who enjoys watching martial arts movies, but it would also appeal to anyone interested in intercultural experience.Aicha, a young woman, struggles to meet her conservative parents' expectations of her, while she secretly learns Kung Fu and joins a Kung Fu club that has her competing with top-notch fighters of both sexes.  She runs, trains, fights, reads, and forms friendships in a culture not her own.  She and her family are Muslim Turks living in Denmark.The characterization in the film is excellent, not shallow or trite, but deep and complex.  Throughout the film, Aicha has the same frightening dream about being attacked by a fighter who leaps at her, and she must defend herself with everything she has.  Seen in the context of honor killings and the strict moral code of the culture she and her family are from, it is clear that her sense of danger is not imagined.  She is a consummate fighter, but her family expects her to be a proper Muslim girl and spend all of her time studying and doing well in school, not fighting men!  Aicha is pulled between the attraction she feels for two fellow Kung Fu students:  Omar who is handsome and strong but from her own culture, and another young man who is Danish and Christian.  She doesn't have intimacy with either one of them; the tension is there nonetheless. Ironically, the romantic break with tradition comes from Aicha's brother who sleeps with his fiancee and makes her pregnant.  He is almost murdered for it.  But Aicha, despite her feelings, stays chaste.  She ends up saving her brother's life, with a little help from Omar.  The character Omar is an interesting one.  He's also Turkish and Muslim and a Kung Fu fighter in the same club, but he refuses to fight Aicha when the Kung Fu master orders him to.  However, at a noisy bridal celebration, the two get into a crazy fight, not a Kung Fu fight but a food-throwing, hair-pulling, angry fight, and there is some chemistry there although it is never articulated.At the end, all three students compete, and Omar wins the top prize, while the Danish fellow loses to none other than Aicha.  But Aicha wins the second prize, and she's happy with that.",5,A Must See Film,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2246,"['Fighter', 'richly', 'meaningful', 'film', 'course', 'would', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'who', 'watching', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'would', 'also', 'appeal', 'anyone', 'interested', 'intercultural', 'experience.Aicha', 'young', 'woman', 'meet', 'conservative', 'parents', 'expectations', 'secretly', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'club', 'competing', 'top-notch', 'fighters', 'sexes', 'trains', 'fights', 'reads', 'forms', 'friendships', 'culture', 'not', 'own', 'family', 'are', 'Muslim', 'Turks', 'living', 'Denmark.The', 'characterization', 'film', 'excellent', 'not', 'shallow', 'trite', 'deep', 'complex', 'film', 'Aicha', 'same', 'frightening', 'dream', 'being', 'attacked', 'fighter', 'who', 'must', 'defend', 'everything', 'Seen', 'context', 'honor', 'killings', 'strict', 'moral', 'code', 'culture', 'family', 'are', 'clear', 'sense', 'danger', 'not', 'imagined', 'consummate', 'fighter', 'family', 'be', 'proper', 'Muslim', 'girl', 'spend', 'time', 'studying', 'doing', 'well', 'school', 'not', 'fighting', 'men', 'Aicha', 'pulled', 'attraction', 'two', 'fellow', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'students', 'Omar', 'who', 'handsome', 'strong', 'own', 'culture', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'Danish', 'Christian', ""n't"", 'have', 'intimacy', 'one', 'tension', 'there', 'nonetheless', 'Ironically', 'romantic', 'break', 'tradition', 'Aicha', 'brother', 'who', 'fiancee', 'pregnant', 'almost', 'murdered', 'Aicha', 'feelings', 'stays', 'chaste', 'up', 'saving', 'brother', 'life', 'little', 'help', 'Omar', 'character', 'Omar', 'interesting', 'one', 'also', 'Turkish', 'Muslim', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'fighter', 'same', 'club', 'fight', 'Aicha', 'when', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'master', 'orders', 'However', 'noisy', 'bridal', 'celebration', 'two', 'get', 'crazy', 'fight', 'not', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'fight', 'food-throwing', 'hair-pulling', 'angry', 'fight', 'chemistry', 'never', 'articulated.At', 'end', 'three', 'students', 'compete', 'Omar', 'top', 'prize', 'Danish', 'fellow', 'none', 'other', 'Aicha', 'Aicha', 'second', 'prize', 'happy']",N/A

We cannot but admnire the courage of this rebellious young woman determined to acheive her dreams and we not only indentify with her aspirations, but root for her all the way. Fortunately this film is very personal and doesn't get into Middle-Eastern politics which makes it superior to an intelligent but deceptively poisonous film like Amereeka or idiotic self-condeming Israeli films. Free of political agendas, with the first frame opening the film one gets the feeling this is going to be an art film and it is. The strong character development, sparse dialogue, textured acting by a wonderful all around unknown cast is so real that you think you're watching a documentary.

After about 5 minutes I was hooked & will order this as a keeper.I hadn't seen Semra Turan before and I am impressed with her martial arts skills & her acting ability. I enjoyed this movie even with the subtitles which were very easy to follow. This movie was well written & well acted about a young girl's inner turmoil to please her family while seeking her own path.

1270622,A2OXIF4OZUKKV9,B002IRYYCS,RP,"[0, 0]","Not much to add that hasn't been said already; overall it does have a ""Bend It...""-type theme but was better imo. This movie had great cinematics, was more thoughtful and went much deeper into the characters. It's sort of a rare gem you typically find buried in Hulu that could/should have done better at the box office but didn't, possibly due to its lame-ish ending (more/spoiler below). Still, definitely watchable more than once - the meat of the movie is well worth it. Also loved that they dabbled in Turkish, English and Danish(?). Nice mix and kudos to the actors for pulling it off so well.*******SPOILER**************SPOILER*******Two things about the ending. I sort of didn't like the way they dealt with her love interest in the competition itself, but having her come in 2nd was a really good move. Winning the whole thing, of course, would have gone against the realistic grain of the film and applied too much of a ""fairy tale"" cap on things.With that said, the romantic part of the ending was pretty lame. The two fighters spend the entire movie being frustrated that they like each other but can't do anything about it, and the ""resolution"" is that they are going to keep being frustrated that they like each other and can't do anything about it.

An impressive film. The plot is reminiscent of a ""Karate Kid"" save that the conflicting battle is more internal rather than external. Aicha (Semra Turan) is a strong-willed girl who does not simply conform to her conservative Muslim culture which creates indifference between her, her family, and others of her culture.Her parents are Turkish immigrants with conservative family and cultural values. Her father expects his children to be raised in a prosperous nation, such as Danmark, intent on becoming successful doctors. Aicha, however, doesn't comply with such demands and instead fights, literally, to earn a different kind of respect. She is fascinated by the martial arts and with persistence, convinces the master (Sifu) of a respected academy to allow her admittance to train. Aicha trains in secret against the demands of not only her family, but her culture as well, where man is the dominate figure (What is not clear is how she finances her training).That aside, her brother, a doctor at a local hospital, is engaged to a young woman whose Muslim family is also disassociated with the host Danish culture. Omar, a friend of the bride-to-be's brother, is a martial artist in the same academy as Aicha and believes it disgraceful of her to be a part of something not meant for a Muslim woman. He refuses to train with her, and also finds it a shameful that she takes a liking to a fellow Danish peer in the academy. This developing relationship, and the control it gives Omar, become the catalysts for an internal culture clash that may produce fatal results.Concerning Aicha's family, she and her father constantly butt heads; while she is trying to acclimate to the Danish society, her father expects her to maintain her cultural identity. Neither parent considers what Aicha wants, rather they expect to direct her life. They may want the best for Aicha, but what is it that she wants? *Sigh* Life just sometimes isn't fair... =)As a movie, it delivers dramatically and thematically. It is reflective of how many immigrants continue to repopulate the European continent, and do so without assimilating into the host country. It shows how different cultures live separately among others, particularly those of the east.**Possible Spoiler below**Romantically, I was disappointed in the end even though the reality of it is more practical than a western fairy-tale ending.",4,Fights Assimilation as well as Culture,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,2549,"['watched', 'movie', 'demand', 'expectations', 'just', 'intrigue', 'partial', 'Danish', 'background', 'movie', 'Danish', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'impressive', 'film', 'plot', 'reminiscent', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'save', 'conflicting', 'battle', 'more', 'internal', 'rather', 'external', 'Aicha', 'Semra', 'Turan', 'strong-willed', 'girl', 'who', 'not', 'simply', 'conform', 'conservative', 'Muslim', 'culture', 'indifference', 'family', 'others', 'culture.Her', 'parents', 'are', 'Turkish', 'immigrants', 'conservative', 'family', 'cultural', 'values', 'father', 'children', 'be', 'raised', 'prosperous', 'nation', 'such', 'Danmark', 'intent', 'becoming', 'successful', 'doctors', 'Aicha', 'however', ""n't"", 'comply', 'such', 'demands', 'instead', 'fights', 'literally', 'earn', 'different', 'kind', 'respect', 'fascinated', 'martial', 'arts', 'persistence', 'master', 'Sifu', 'respected', 'academy', 'allow', 'admittance', 'train', 'Aicha', 'secret', 'demands', 'not', 'only', 'family', 'culture', 'well', 'where', 'man', 'dominate', 'figure', 'What', 'not', 'clear', 'how', 'training', 'aside', 'brother', 'doctor', 'local', 'hospital', 'engaged', 'young', 'woman', 'Muslim', 'family', 'also', 'disassociated', 'host', 'Danish', 'culture', 'Omar', 'friend', 'bride-to-be', 'brother', 'martial', 'artist', 'same', 'academy', 'Aicha', 'disgraceful', 'be', 'part', 'something', 'not', 'meant', 'Muslim', 'woman', 'train', 'also', 'shameful', 'liking', 'fellow', 'Danish', 'peer', 'academy', 'developing', 'relationship', 'control', 'Omar', 'become', 'catalysts', 'internal', 'culture', 'clash', 'may', 'produce', 'fatal', 'results.Concerning', 'Aicha', 'family', 'father', 'constantly', 'heads', 'trying', 'acclimate', 'Danish', 'society', 'father', 'maintain', 'cultural', 'identity', 'parent', 'considers', 'what', 'Aicha', 'rather', 'expect', 'direct', 'life', 'may', 'want', 'best', 'Aicha', 'what', '*Sigh*', 'Life', 'just', 'sometimes', ""n't"", 'fair', '=', 'movie', 'dramatically', 'thematically', 'reflective', 'how', 'many', 'immigrants', 'continue', 'repopulate', 'European', 'continent', 'do', 'so', 'assimilating', 'host', 'country', 'how', 'different', 'cultures', 'live', 'separately', 'others', 'particularly', 'east', '**Possible', 'Spoiler', 'below**Romantically', 'was', 'disappointed', 'end', 'even', 'reality', 'more', 'practical', 'western', 'fairy-tale', 'ending']",N/A
