207670,AO37T54VEP0JQ,6300213102,"B.C. Scribe ""trekviewer""","[0, 0]","Although sixth in the sequence of the inaugural season episodes, this show was selected to be the first seen.  It was considered more accessible to television audiences of the time and of course the goal was to win over as many viewers as possible immediately.  The critical reviews appearing back then were not condemning but hardly praiseworthy either.  Of note though is that one particularly unperceptive TV critic suggested the show would never garner a large enough audience to last one season!  HA!Written by author George Clayton Johnson who penned eight shows for the classic 'The Twilight Zone', his script for 'The Man Trap' is one of the highlights of the first season.  Johnson had written a bit of a different version than what appears on screen; the opening was changed from the transporter room to the surface and the Salt Creature finds it's way to the Enterprise a bit faster and more cleverly.  But his idea of the shape shifting salt monger remains one of the most frightening aliens the crew encountered.  Reading a person's thoughts and able to adapt itself to appear as anyone it pleases, the 'monster' manages to avoid capture both on the surface and later on the Enterprise.  Having the creature pose as a former flame of the doctor produces some anguish that is effectively conveyed throughout and results in the tragic climax.  Overall a very good show especially when you consider that the writer had only audible instructions on the behavior patterns of the characters; naturally it's easier to write an episode after you've seen several of them.There are two good scenes that standout in this show - Uhura has an encounter with an unusual crewman on the lower decks and as she becomes paralyzed with fear he brings his hands up to her face with slow resolve; near the conclusion Spock enters the doctor's quarters and seeing the creature about to attack the captain, places himself between the two and starts battering the woman's face with his clenched fists causing a great conflict to arise in McCoy.  On the unusual side Spock gets &quot;chewed out&quot; by Uhura during the episode's beginning for a failure to express concern when the landing party reports a casualty; also Sulu does double duty as helmsman and as the ship's botanist, a rather unique combination of skills don't you think?",4,Launching the most successful  franchise in TV history,1045353600,"02 16, 2003",2003,2326,"['sixth', 'sequence', 'inaugural', 'season', 'episodes', 'show', 'was', 'selected', 'be', 'first', 'seen', 'was', 'considered', 'more', 'accessible', 'television', 'audiences', 'time', 'course', 'goal', 'was', 'win', 'over', 'many', 'viewers', 'possible', 'immediately', 'critical', 'reviews', 'appearing', 'back', 'then', 'were', 'not', 'condemning', 'hardly', 'praiseworthy', 'note', 'though', 'one', 'particularly', 'unperceptive', 'TV', 'critic', 'suggested', 'show', 'would', 'never', 'garner', 'large', 'enough', 'audience', 'last', 'one', 'season', 'HA', 'Written', 'author', 'George', 'Clayton', 'Johnson', 'who', 'penned', 'eight', 'shows', 'classic', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'script', ""'The"", 'Man', 'Trap', 'one', 'highlights', 'first', 'season', 'Johnson', 'had', 'written', 'bit', 'different', 'version', 'what', 'screen', 'opening', 'was', 'changed', 'transporter', 'room', 'surface', 'Salt', 'Creature', 'way', 'Enterprise', 'bit', 'faster', 'more', 'cleverly', 'idea', 'shape', 'shifting', 'salt', 'monger', 'one', 'most', 'frightening', 'crew', 'encountered', 'Reading', 'person', 'thoughts', 'able', 'adapt', 'appear', 'anyone', ""'monster"", 'manages', 'avoid', 'capture', 'surface', 'later', 'Enterprise', 'Having', 'creature', 'pose', 'former', 'flame', 'doctor', 'anguish', 'effectively', 'conveyed', 'results', 'tragic', 'climax', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'writer', 'had', 'only', 'audible', 'instructions', 'behavior', 'patterns', 'characters', 'naturally', 'easier', 'write', 'episode', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'are', 'two', 'good', 'scenes', 'standout', 'show', 'Uhura', 'encounter', 'unusual', 'crewman', 'lower', 'decks', 'paralyzed', 'fear', 'hands', 'up', 'face', 'slow', 'resolve', 'conclusion', 'Spock', 'doctor', 'quarters', 'seeing', 'creature', 'attack', 'captain', 'two', 'battering', 'woman', 'face', 'clenched', 'fists', 'causing', 'great', 'conflict', 'arise', 'McCoy', 'unusual', 'side', 'Spock', 'quot', 'chewed', 'out', 'quot', 'Uhura', 'episode', 'beginning', 'failure', 'express', 'concern', 'when', 'landing', 'party', 'reports', 'casualty', 'also', 'Sulu', 'double', 'duty', 'helmsman', 'ship', 'botanist', 'rather', 'unique', 'combination', 'skills', 'do', ""n't"", 'think']",N/A
207671,A1F7U2TQHO3A8J,6300213102,Brian Overland,"[0, 0]","Oddly, this is the episode the network chose to first air (although others were completed first), introducing the world to Star Trek. At first glance, ""Man Tap"" lives down to the cliche of ""scary monster in a cheap costume who tries to kill everyone on the ship."" But there's much beneath the surface. Later episodes would focus on Kirk, Spock, and McCoy to the detriment of supporting characters. TNG tried to correct that, but at the cost of having fuzzier dramatic focus. In contrast, ""Man Trap"" gives us interesting scenes involving Uhura, Sulu, and Janice Rand, but in a way that keeps dramatic tension high.This is a terrific episode for Uhura. By chance, she runs into the ""salt vampire"" that has gotten aboard the ship and seeks to survive by sucking all the salt from its victims. The twist is that the creature can appear in whatever form suits its purpose; also, it can read minds. To McCoy, it appears as his long lost love, Nancy Crater. To a hapless crewman (strangely, in a blue shirt, not a red), the creature is a busty blonde from a ""pleasure planet."" To Uhura, the creature appears as a tall black crewman who can speak Swahili. Uhura just barely escapes.Early on, there's a fun scene between Uhura and Spock when she speaks longingly of a moonlit romantic evening. ""Miss Uhura, Vulcan has no moon."" ""I don't doubt it, Mr. Spock."" In that same scene, Uhura mentions that she hates the word ""frequency."" This is both ironic and appropriate, considering that in many later episodes her dialog consists of little more than ""Hailing frequences open.""",4,Classic Trek as an Ensemble Show,1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,1565,"['Oddly', 'episode', 'network', 'chose', 'first', 'air', 'others', 'were', 'completed', 'first', 'introducing', 'world', 'Star', 'Trek', 'first', 'glance', 'Man', 'Tap', 'down', 'cliche', 'scary', 'monster', 'cheap', 'costume', 'who', 'kill', 'everyone', 'ship', 'much', 'surface', 'Later', 'episodes', 'would', 'focus', 'Kirk', 'Spock', 'McCoy', 'detriment', 'supporting', 'characters', 'TNG', 'tried', 'correct', 'cost', 'having', 'fuzzier', 'dramatic', 'focus', 'contrast', 'Man', 'Trap', 'interesting', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Uhura', 'Sulu', 'Janice', 'Rand', 'way', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'high.This', 'terrific', 'episode', 'Uhura', 'chance', 'salt', 'vampire', 'gotten', 'ship', 'survive', 'sucking', 'salt', 'victims', 'twist', 'creature', 'can', 'appear', 'form', 'suits', 'purpose', 'also', 'can', 'read', 'minds', 'McCoy', 'long', 'lost', 'love', 'Nancy', 'Crater', 'hapless', 'crewman', 'strangely', 'blue', 'shirt', 'not', 'red', 'creature', 'busty', 'blonde', 'pleasure', 'planet', 'Uhura', 'creature', 'tall', 'black', 'crewman', 'who', 'can', 'speak', 'Swahili', 'Uhura', 'just', 'barely', 'escapes.Early', 'fun', 'scene', 'Uhura', 'Spock', 'when', 'longingly', 'moonlit', 'romantic', 'evening', 'Miss', 'Uhura', 'Vulcan', 'moon', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'Mr', 'Spock', 'same', 'scene', 'Uhura', 'mentions', 'word', 'frequency', 'ironic', 'appropriate', 'considering', 'many', 'later', 'dialog', 'little', 'more', 'Hailing', 'frequences', 'open']",N/A

Ten years earlier, McCoy and Nancy were an item, then they parted ways and she married Robert Crater. McCoy never saw her after she left and has mixed feelings about their visit to the scientists. M1113 is arid - dry, hot and extremely salt deprived. McCoy has come to give the Craters a required annual medical exam. Robert Crater is resistant and says all they need is salt pills.When McCoy sees Nancy, he sees her just as she was 10 years earlier - a girl of 25. When Kirk sees her, she is a woman in her mid 40s and when the Ensign with them sees her, he sees a tall blonde hottie he claims to recognize from a pleasure planet.As McCoy examines Robert Crater, they hear Nancy screaming. She is standing over the body of the young ensign - he is dead as a doornail - with circular mottled marks on his face. McCoy finds a piece of fruit in his mouth and Nancy states that it is the deadly Borgia plant - from the Nightshade family, indigenous to the planet.A medical exam rules out poisoning - McCoy finds that the ensign was completely depleted of salt. When Spock, Kirk and 2 other ensigns beam down to investigate further, they find one of the ensigns dead and the other missing. When they find the missing crewman, they beam back up. Unbeknownst to them, Ensign Green is really some creature from the planet that has been masquerading as Nancy.After Ensign Green's body is discovered on the planet, they realize that the person they beamed up wasn't Green... but it's too late.This creature, as Robert Crater describes it, is the last of its kind, like the Do-Do bird of earth. All of its kin died from lack of salt and it's the last one. After it killed Crater's wife, he tried to kill it, but then felt sympathy for it. It took the form of his wife and has been his surrogate companion all these years, friend, lover, cook and entertainer.In many ways, it's quite silly that the creature has been living peacefully with the doctor for at least a year, surviving on salt tablets, but now that it's on the ship, it goes on an eating rampage, killing one person after another to suck the salt out of them.The creature, in its true form, looks like a cross between a blue shag carpet and a funnel - a truly loathesome looking mess - and Robert Crater has been knocking boots with this thing!McCoy acts like a puppy in love, totally irresponsible and goofy - but this is only the 6th episode, so characters were still in development.The concept of this creature was very clever - assuming the shape of what the viewer desires to see, siphoning the salt right out of them.

And if you think your job is difficult, just think how hard it is for the head of the tourism authority of planet M-113 to come up with new ways to attract visitors.  The planet is barren, the scenery is far from beautiful, and on top of that, you never know when a salt vampire disguised as someone you know will walk up to you and suck all the sodium chloride out of your body.The U.S.S. Enterprise enters orbit of planet M-113 to drop off supplies to Robert Crater (Alfred Ryder) &amp; Nancy Crater (Jeanne Bal).  The Craters are married but Nancy had once been in a relationship with Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley).  The Craters tell Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) that they want to be left alone but he is unable to grant their request after a member of his landing party turns up dead.  As Kirk and McCoy try to solve the mystery, Nancy Crater starts to roam freely aboard the Enterprise.  She is actually the sole survivor of planet M-113, a shape-shifter who needs salt to survive.  After the creature is exposed, McCoy kills it in order to save his captain.Chalk up the salt vampire as another one of Star Trek's classic aliens.  The long-tangled hair, the dried skin, the suction cups on its fingers - what's not to like?  Yet despite the episode's camp value, it is also memorable for helping to bring Dr. McCoy's character into the spotlight.  The original Star Trek was great because of the interaction between Kirk, Spock (Leonard Nimoy), and McCoy and this was the first episode that started to flesh out the cantankerous and lovable doctor.
