563251,A249E17QH15NSN,B000051S3A,Charles 22,"[0, 0]","This isn't a remastered effort as far as I can tell, but the picture isn't too bad; a little better than you would expect out of old stuff.I write primarily because I like this show immensely and wish there was more of it. I grew up seeing some repeats of this show, but I was convinced there was something always better to do or watch. Man, did I miss out! This is a VERY funny show, and once more shows the genius of Hal Roach. You see his influences on many of the ways people react and how the action is cut, etc. Every single character in this show is funny, which is really a rarity. I don't know, buy maybe the makers of this dvd put together all the best Margie, or focused on all the episodes with conflict, but from what I see of this dvd anyway, this is a very nutty show and there's constantly scheming and conniving going on. This show puts I Love Lucy to shame; just brilliant! Until I got this dvd, I had no idea at how much scheming went on between father and daughter. I knew Margie was that way, but I just had no idea so much of it was focused on the father. Man, do I ever want to see all four seasons of this gem, if nothing else just to see periods where it wasn't this superb.A favorite episode of mine sees a gangster giving Margie a surprise super-smooch, but then later springs another surrpise on her (literally) and the two crooks laugh their heads off at her. Where else have you seen that, where thugs surprise a victim, not once, but twice, and then laugh their heads at them afterwards? I've surely never seen that. It was awesome to see those complete strangers (gangsters) pull stunts on Margie, because she is so deserving. I WANT MORE!!!!!I'm sorry. I've since learned that My Little Margie was produced by Hal Roach Jr, not Hal Roach as stated previously. I was under the impression that Sr did this because he lived so long, and that he in fact was named Jr and not his son (if he had one). His son obviously took a lot of talent from his father. It turns out HR Sr had produced some shows, including The Charles Farrel Show into the late 50's, so I wasn't too terribly far off.",5,My Big Vern,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,2116,"[""n't"", 'remastered', 'effort', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'picture', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'little', 'better', 'would', 'expect', 'old', 'stuff.I', 'write', 'primarily', 'like', 'show', 'immensely', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'grew', 'up', 'seeing', 'repeats', 'show', 'was', 'convinced', 'was', 'something', 'always', 'better', 'do', 'watch', 'Man', 'did', 'miss', 'out', 'VERY', 'funny', 'show', 'once', 'more', 'genius', 'Hal', 'Roach', 'see', 'influences', 'many', 'ways', 'people', 'react', 'how', 'action', 'cut', 'etc', 'single', 'character', 'show', 'funny', 'really', 'rarity', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'buy', 'maybe', 'makers', 'dvd', 'put', 'together', 'best', 'Margie', 'focused', 'episodes', 'conflict', 'what', 'see', 'dvd', 'anyway', 'very', 'nutty', 'show', 'constantly', 'scheming', 'conniving', 'going', 'show', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'shame', 'just', 'brilliant', 'got', 'dvd', 'had', 'idea', 'how', 'much', 'scheming', 'went', 'father', 'daughter', 'knew', 'Margie', 'was', 'way', 'just', 'had', 'idea', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'focused', 'father', 'Man', 'do', 'ever', 'want', 'see', 'four', 'seasons', 'gem', 'nothing', 'else', 'just', 'see', 'periods', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'superb.A', 'favorite', 'episode', 'mine', 'gangster', 'giving', 'Margie', 'surprise', 'super-smooch', 'then', 'later', 'surrpise', 'literally', 'two', 'crooks', 'heads', 'off', 'Where', 'else', 'have', 'seen', 'where', 'thugs', 'surprise', 'victim', 'not', 'once', 'twice', 'then', 'heads', 'afterwards', ""'ve"", 'surely', 'never', 'seen', 'was', 'awesome', 'see', 'complete', 'strangers', 'gangsters', 'pull', 'stunts', 'Margie', 'so', 'deserving', 'WANT', 'MORE', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'My', 'Little', 'Margie', 'was', 'produced', 'Hal', 'Roach', 'Jr', 'not', 'Hal', 'Roach', 'stated', 'previously', 'was', 'impression', 'Sr', 'did', 'lived', 'so', 'long', 'fact', 'was', 'named', 'Jr', 'not', 'son', 'had', 'one', 'son', 'obviously', 'took', 'lot', 'talent', 'father', 'out', 'HR', 'Sr', 'had', 'produced', 'shows', 'including', 'Charles', 'Farrel', 'Show', 'late', '50', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'terribly', 'far', 'off']",My Little Margie #1

I've spent an entire Sunday watching a good portion of the episodes contained on these DVD's.  Gale Storm & Charles Farrell are excellent in this series & have a fine chemistry that is apparent in this sitcom.Gertrude Hoffman is also a treat as Mrs. Odetts, always dragging Margie into another of her screwball schemes.  That Mrs. Odetts is one agile & feisty old Lady.  LOL.As all 195o's sitcoms, it's a bit dated, but still manages to hold up quite well, even today.  I'd gladly take this show over all of the garbage on the tube today.  To me, it's a timeless time capsule to the infancy of tv comedy when comedy was truly funny & didn't need to resort to tactics of vulgarity to get a laugh.  My Little Margie was & still is funny & highly entertaining.

563253,A3D5CVFNIYQCSI,B000051S3A,David,"[148, 148]","When I first discovered that a two volume DVD set of My Little Margie was to be marketed, I couldn't believe it! I didn't think I'd ever see even one show from this great old series again, let alone the 24 that are included in these two sets. Besides, I figured, even if this early/mid-fifties gem ever surfaced again it would be on TV Land or Nickelodeon and would be ruined by nightmarish commercial breaks (we have DSS), squeezed end-credits, and inane voiceovers.VCI to the rescue! I've just reviewed the two DVDs in this first set and watched the first two shows on disk #1 and am extremely pleased! Knowing how things unfortunately are sometimes done these days, I had feared a poor quality transfer and a certain amount of butchering to have been done, but that's not the case at all, thank goodness!I recall these shows from my early childhood, and they look and sound exactly as I remember them. Even the elaborate musical score that accompanies the end credits is there, complete and impressive as when brand new. The opening gimmick, where the facing images in the father/daughter photographs talk about each other, are there too--still clever, still cute, still funny! In fact, these shows are exactly as first viewed almost 50 years ago, but thanks to the clever writing (those early TV writers cut their teeth in the demanding medium of radio comedy) and the outstanding talents of Charles Farrell and Gale Storm (sigh!), these shows are still funny and engaging. I couldn't be more pleased!One last note about the quality. We tend to forget how relatively murky television was in the Fifties. Broadcasting equipment was primitive but improving rapidly. However, because microwave and satellite transmission had not yet arrived, network affiliates in the major cities actually got their prime time shows from the networks in the mail!!! Yes, the studios sent out 16mm film copies of the shows, and that's how the local stations showed them in the appointed time slots. Over the years ensuing, hobbyists have collected these old affiliate films, and that's in part why they are now available and in such good condition. Since these My Little Margie DVDs are made from those fine 16mm broadcast originals, instead of kinescope copies, the image quality is actually better than when they were originally broadcast! And the sound, while not stereo or anything like it, is at least up to mono TV broadcast standards of 15 or 20 years ago.My verdict -- these are terrific DVDs, and if you like lovely, perky, endearing, sparkly-eyed feminine firecrackers, you will love Gale Storm, just as I did as an 8-year-old boy!",5,"Looks great, still funny!",986428800,"04 5, 2001",2001,2625,"['When', 'first', 'discovered', 'two', 'volume', 'DVD', 'set', 'My', 'Little', 'Margie', 'was', 'be', 'marketed', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', ""'d"", 'ever', 'see', 'even', 'one', 'show', 'great', 'old', 'series', 'again', 'let', 'alone', '24', 'are', 'included', 'two', 'sets', 'figured', 'even', 'early/mid-fifties', 'gem', 'ever', 'surfaced', 'again', 'would', 'be', 'TV', 'Land', 'Nickelodeon', 'would', 'be', 'ruined', 'nightmarish', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'have', 'DSS', 'squeezed', 'end-credits', 'inane', 'voiceovers.VCI', 'rescue', ""'ve"", 'just', 'reviewed', 'two', 'DVDs', 'first', 'set', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'shows', 'disk', '1', 'am', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'Knowing', 'how', 'things', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'sometimes', 'done', 'days', 'had', 'feared', 'poor', 'quality', 'transfer', 'certain', 'amount', 'butchering', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'not', 'case', 'thank', 'goodness', 'recall', 'shows', 'early', 'childhood', 'look', 'sound', 'exactly', 'remember', 'Even', 'elaborate', 'musical', 'score', 'end', 'there', 'complete', 'impressive', 'when', 'brand', 'new', 'opening', 'gimmick', 'where', 'facing', 'images', 'father/daughter', 'photographs', 'talk', 'other', 'are', 'there', 'too', 'still', 'clever', 'still', 'cute', 'still', 'funny', 'fact', 'shows', 'are', 'exactly', 'first', 'viewed', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'ago', 'thanks', 'clever', 'writing', 'early', 'TV', 'writers', 'cut', 'teeth', 'demanding', 'medium', 'radio', 'comedy', 'outstanding', 'talents', 'Charles', 'Farrell', 'Gale', 'Storm', 'sigh', 'shows', 'are', 'still', 'funny', 'engaging', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'pleased', 'One', 'last', 'note', 'quality', 'tend', 'forget', 'how', 'relatively', 'murky', 'television', 'was', 'Fifties', 'Broadcasting', 'equipment', 'was', 'primitive', 'improving', 'rapidly', 'However', 'microwave', 'satellite', 'transmission', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'arrived', 'network', 'affiliates', 'major', 'cities', 'actually', 'got', 'prime', 'time', 'shows', 'networks', 'mail', 'Yes', 'studios', 'sent', 'out', '16mm', 'film', 'copies', 'shows', 'how', 'local', 'stations', 'showed', 'appointed', 'time', 'slots', 'years', 'ensuing', 'hobbyists', 'have', 'collected', 'old', 'affiliate', 'films', 'part', 'why', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'such', 'good', 'condition', 'My', 'Little', 'Margie', 'DVDs', 'are', 'made', 'fine', '16mm', 'broadcast', 'originals', 'instead', 'kinescope', 'copies', 'image', 'quality', 'actually', 'better', 'when', 'were', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'sound', 'not', 'stereo', 'anything', 'least', 'up', 'mono', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'standards', '15', '20', 'years', 'ago.My', 'verdict', 'are', 'terrific', 'DVDs', 'like', 'lovely', 'perky', 'endearing', 'sparkly-eyed', 'feminine', 'firecrackers', 'will', 'love', 'Gale', 'Storm', 'just', 'did', '8-year-old', 'boy']",My Little Margie #1

By doing so they made television history with &quot;My Little Margie.&quot; The viewer can see a real love between &quot;father&quot; and &quot;daughter&quot; in this show. There's none of that &quot;give me my fat paycheck so I can get out of here&quot; attitude that is so easily seen in today's sitcoms. Vern Albright's &quot;Boston&quot; accent is a real treasure and Gale Storm is an angel. When I was a kid watching this show first-run, I had a big crush on Gale Storm. I thought she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I'm sure at 81 that Ms. Storm is still beautiful and still getting into mischief.Unfortunately, Vern Albright, Mr. Honeywell, Mrs. O'Detts, and Freddy Wilson have all gone on to TV heaven, but we can still enjoy them over and over again in this wonderful 12 episode set.For the most part the sound and picture quality are GREAT!
