Fiebiger,"[4, 4]","If you REALLY wanna see Little Richard at his fabulous best, seek out a DVD-R of a 1973 movie skillfully directed by Robert Able called LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL.  20th Century Fox has stupidly never released it to video, but VH1 aired it in the 90s with a good re-mixed stereo soundtrack and some people recorded it and can provide a DVD-R.  Google the title and some providers will pop up.  The film also features other great rock acts from the 50s and early 60s, including Chubby Checker, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, The Five Satins, Fats Domino, The Coasters, and some others.  Influenced by the WOODSTOCK movie, it uses multiple screens even more effectively.  There's also some great montage sequences of 50s imagery as well.  A great film and Little Richard's BEST performance captured on film !

His last Top 40 hit was more than a decade earlier and he would never have another. But Richard was always convinced of his own fabulousness and knew the world should be convinced of it too. And he ripped the crowd into a frenzy during his half hour set, thanks to timeless classics like ""Lucille"" and ""Long Tall Sally"" -- not to mention a shirt adorned with tiny mirrors and a towering wig. DA Pennebaker captures the moment well, though the sound leaves something to be desired and at 30 minutes this is awfully short. Why not give us three hours of the day-long festival, of which this could be a highlight? On its own, it's just not enough.

1232403,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B001R0KHKA,Phil S.,"[0, 0]","Richard's ""comeback"" got in gear in 1968 and continued into 1971, so we are safe in that timeline to say that Richard is in command, all the way through.We are in ***** minus territory though, as Richard leaves the keyboard early and never returns. Although, if you want super representative, time-capsule takes on LUCILLE and MOLLY, cuts one and two (BLUEBERRY HILL comes up first but was actually next to last!)...you got 'em.Another ""minus"" is that we got about 28 minutes of the King. For the lifetime fan like me, it's tough not to see this another opportunity - to a great extent - blown. Considering the quality herein, the unitiated may question ""blown"". But for many of us who were ""there"" (following him closely at the time), this is merely a morsel. I fondly recall a double-date and a visit to Madison square Garden in late 1970 when Little Richard tore the roof off the joint, singing and playing in a way to surprise even the most ardent believer - what a flick *that* would have made!!!
