The mother of young Muggs McGinnis (Gorcey) shares with him a letter received from his late father's close friend, ""Uncle"" Pete, a wealthy Texan, in which he Pete tells of an impending visit by him and his daughter Judy to the McGinnis home in New York where the rancher expects to meet for the first time the five brothers and the sister Annabelle of Muggs, non-existent siblings invented by the widow McGinnis in order to receive Pete's financial support over many years.  Muggs conscripts his East Side roustabout cohorts as his family, with Glimpy (Huntz Hall) dressed as Annabelle, and when Uncle Pete and Judy arrive in New York, confused jollity ensues, until a local thug plots to expose the impersonation as a means of obtaining some of Pete's wealth for himself.  The film, produced with a virtually non-existent budget, has a virtually non-existent script, as well, with ad libbing contributed by most of the cast, notably Gorcey with his rather fascinating employment of malapropisms, all of which is very compatible to Beaudine's loose-reined directoral mode.  His relaxed methods must also take responsibility for some ragged performing, and there is need for more efficient editing, but this comedic affair eschews the wonted wartime jingoism that marks the series, and Hall is enormously and unexpectedly hilarious in his gender bending role, joining the other members of the cast in patent enjoyment of playing in this entry.  The DVD version offers no special features.",3,EAST SIDERS BACK UP MUGGS.,1117152000,"05 27, 2005",2005,1890,"['course', 'second', 'manifestation', 'Leo', 'Gorcey', 'mini-mob', 'players', 'East', 'Side', 'Kids', 'who', 'followed', 'Dead', 'End', 'Kids', 'preceding', 'Bowery', 'Boys', 'producer', 'Sam', 'Katzman', 'hired', 'veteran', 'director', 'William', 'Beaudine', 'East', 'Side', 'series', 'due', 'established', 'success', 'leading', 'movie', 'youngsters', 'quite', 'effective', 'Monogram', 'release', 'initial', 'effort', 'Beaudine', 'helm', 'mother', 'young', 'Muggs', 'McGinnis', 'Gorcey', 'shares', 'letter', 'received', 'late', 'father', 'close', 'friend', 'Uncle', 'Pete', 'wealthy', 'Texan', 'Pete', 'impending', 'visit', 'daughter', 'Judy', 'McGinnis', 'home', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'rancher', 'meet', 'first', 'time', 'five', 'brothers', 'sister', 'Annabelle', 'Muggs', 'non-existent', 'siblings', 'invented', 'widow', 'McGinnis', 'order', 'receive', 'Pete', 'financial', 'support', 'many', 'years', 'Muggs', 'East', 'Side', 'roustabout', 'cohorts', 'family', 'Glimpy', 'Huntz', 'Hall', 'dressed', 'Annabelle', 'when', 'Uncle', 'Pete', 'Judy', 'arrive', 'New', 'York', 'confused', 'jollity', 'ensues', 'local', 'thug', 'plots', 'expose', 'impersonation', 'means', 'obtaining', 'Pete', 'wealth', 'film', 'produced', 'virtually', 'non-existent', 'budget', 'virtually', 'non-existent', 'script', 'as', 'well', 'ad', 'libbing', 'contributed', 'most', 'cast', 'notably', 'Gorcey', 'rather', 'fascinating', 'employment', 'malapropisms', 'very', 'compatible', 'Beaudine', 'loose-reined', 'directoral', 'mode', 'relaxed', 'methods', 'must', 'also', 'take', 'responsibility', 'ragged', 'performing', 'need', 'more', 'efficient', 'editing', 'comedic', 'affair', 'wonted', 'wartime', 'jingoism', 'series', 'Hall', 'enormously', 'unexpectedly', 'hilarious', 'gender', 'bending', 'role', 'joining', 'other', 'members', 'cast', 'patent', 'enjoyment', 'playing', 'entry', 'DVD', 'version', 'special', 'features']",N/A

Muggs (Leo Gorcey) is having a birthday, and just like every year, his rich uncle (Noah Beery) sends him money through the mail. In the card is an announcemnt; Uncle is coming to New York with his daughter (Amelita Ward) to visit. Muggs' mother (Martha Wentworth) becomes distressed. It seems that her husband has been scamming Muggs' uncle for years, telling him that there are seven children, not one, for the extra birthday cash. In order to protect his father's honor, Muggs rounds up the gang to play the parts, including Glimpy (Huntz Hall) as his little sister Annabelle.The story is very funny and well done. The gang's slang really makes for some great jokes, and as always Gorcey and Hall shine. Gorcey is able to bring plenty of laughs by being completely serious, and Hall's goofyness is inevitably funny.",4,Classic Comedy,1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,890,"['Clancy', 'Street', 'Boys', 'tried', 'true', 'storyline', 'b-picture', 'format', 'Muggs', 'Leo', 'Gorcey', 'having', 'birthday', 'just', 'year', 'rich', 'uncle', 'Noah', 'Beery', 'money', 'mail', 'card', 'announcemnt', 'Uncle', 'coming', 'New', 'York', 'daughter', 'Amelita', 'Ward', 'visit', 'Muggs', 'mother', 'Martha', 'Wentworth', 'distressed', 'husband', 'been', 'scamming', 'Muggs', 'uncle', 'years', 'telling', 'are', 'seven', 'children', 'not', 'one', 'extra', 'birthday', 'cash', 'order', 'protect', 'father', 'honor', 'Muggs', 'up', 'gang', 'play', 'parts', 'including', 'Glimpy', 'Huntz', 'Hall', 'little', 'sister', 'Annabelle.The', 'story', 'very', 'funny', 'well', 'done', 'gang', 'slang', 'really', 'great', 'jokes', 'always', 'Gorcey', 'Hall', 'shine', 'Gorcey', 'able', 'bring', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'being', 'completely', 'serious', 'Hall', 'goofyness', 'inevitably', 'funny']",N/A

CLANCY STREET BOYS is Beaudine's first, and also the first East Side escapade to be played strictly for laughs. To impress his father's old friend from Texas, Leo Gorcey has to pass off his rowdy pals as his siblings (including Huntz Hall in lipstick as sister &quot;Annabelle,&quot; and African-American Ernie Morrison as a stepbrother!). Noah Beery and Lita Ward (the future Mrs. Gorcey) are enjoyable as Gorcey's fresh-from-Texas visitors, and Rick Vallin is personable as the heavy. (Vallin became one of producer Sam Katzman's favorite actors.) This was filmed on Katzman's usual how-low-can-we-go budget, which results in frequent ad libs and a relaxed atmosphere. An hour of fun for comedy fans, and series fans will really enjoy it. The print was frequently cut and recut by TV stations, so there are splices at scene changes.
