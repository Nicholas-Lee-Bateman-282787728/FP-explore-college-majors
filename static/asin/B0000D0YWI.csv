The audience is encouraged to embrace both Khanukkah as well as Xmas (though Xmas is observed by the majority of the cast).  Without wanting to use this review as a forum to discuss Xmas at this time, let's just say if you want an Xmas film that's what you'll get....but if you want a Khanukkah film...you'll be disappointed.  For our personal beliefs in the Biblical and historical accuracy of Khanukkah, and it's relationship to Israel & the Messiah, we'd say ""don't buy.""

776820,A25IBLN1JH28MR,B0000D0YWI,"J. Hanson ""Teacher Extraordinaire!""","[7, 8]","Miracle at Moreaux is an inspirational film about overcoming prejudice and the persecution of Jews in WWII.  It shows how a group of children harbor hatred and fear for Jews based on the teachings of their parents.  When three Jewish children attempt to escape Nazi-occupied France, they become stranded at a French Boarding School run  by a Catholic Sister.  The Sister and her charges hide the Jewish children and help them on their journey.  In the process, they learn that Jewish people are no different from themselves.  They learn that there is no place for hatred in our world.  It is a lovely film that I use each year in my classroom. I feel it is appropriate for 3rd grade and up.",5,World War II Gem!,1182902400,"06 27, 2007",2007,690,"['Miracle', 'Moreaux', 'inspirational', 'film', 'overcoming', 'prejudice', 'persecution', 'Jews', 'WWII', 'how', 'group', 'children', 'harbor', 'hatred', 'fear', 'Jews', 'based', 'teachings', 'parents', 'When', 'three', 'Jewish', 'children', 'attempt', 'escape', 'Nazi-occupied', 'France', 'become', 'stranded', 'French', 'Boarding', 'School', 'run', 'Catholic', 'Sister', 'Sister', 'charges', 'hide', 'Jewish', 'children', 'help', 'journey', 'process', 'learn', 'Jewish', 'people', 'are', 'different', 'learn', 'place', 'hatred', 'world', 'lovely', 'film', 'use', 'year', 'classroom', 'feel', 'appropriate', '3rd', 'grade', 'up']",N/A
776821,A1B05INWIDZ74O,B0000D0YWI,M. A. Ramos,"[10, 10]","This film, set in World War II France, deals with a group of Christian students at a boarding school run by a Catholic nun. While they are preparing for a Christmas pageant that their parents will attend, three Jewish children appear at their school hungry and frightened. These three children need sanctuary from the Nazis. The nun, played by Loretta Swit, runs the school and must deal with the Nazis and the fear the Catholic children have of both the Jews and the Nazis finding out about their presence at the school.This unwarranted fear of the Jewish children and the real threat from the Nazis are dealt with in this movie. And the film will end before you realize it. This is a small reminder of fear generated by the Nazis in World War II in the areas that they occupied. It teaches a good lesson in doing what is morally correct instead of what is expedient or in ones own self-interest. It is a good film for the whole family. And is a good viewing choice for the Christmas holiday.",5,A  Hannukah and Christmas Movie,1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,993,"['film', 'set', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'France', 'group', 'Christian', 'students', 'boarding', 'school', 'run', 'Catholic', 'nun', 'are', 'preparing', 'Christmas', 'pageant', 'parents', 'will', 'attend', 'three', 'Jewish', 'children', 'appear', 'school', 'hungry', 'frightened', 'three', 'children', 'need', 'sanctuary', 'Nazis', 'nun', 'played', 'Loretta', 'Swit', 'school', 'must', 'deal', 'Nazis', 'fear', 'Catholic', 'children', 'have', 'Jews', 'Nazis', 'finding', 'out', 'presence', 'school.This', 'unwarranted', 'fear', 'Jewish', 'children', 'real', 'threat', 'Nazis', 'are', 'dealt', 'movie', 'film', 'will', 'end', 'realize', 'small', 'reminder', 'fear', 'generated', 'Nazis', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'areas', 'occupied', 'good', 'lesson', 'doing', 'what', 'morally', 'correct', 'instead', 'what', 'expedient', 'ones', 'own', 'self-interest', 'good', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'good', 'viewing', 'choice', 'Christmas', 'holiday']",N/A
