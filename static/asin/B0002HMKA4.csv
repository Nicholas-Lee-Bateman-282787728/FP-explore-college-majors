833288,A2BPDFR58H9575,B0002HMKA4,Galina,"[1, 1]","The first full-length feature film by the great Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky caused a sensation when it was released and shown at Venice Film Festival in 1962 where it won the Golden Lion. The world had not seen such a powerful motion picture about war and what it does to the youngest and weakest - the children. It is a bleak, haunting and horrifying portrait of lost innocence and the childhood that was interrupted the very day the boy's family was murdered. Although Ivan survived physically, he was changed forever, not a boy but a man who looked in the eye of triumphant death and horror. The film introduces young Nikolai (Kolya) Burlyaev in the fascinating performance as Ivan. ""Ivan's Childhood"" is a screen adaptation of the story by a Russian writer Vladimir Bogomolov ""Ivan"" which is a fiction story but it is based on the real facts. Millions young boys and girls perished during the endless days, months, and years of the worst war of the last century. Bogomolov fought as a soldier during the WWII. He was only 15 years old but he had forged his papers - added two years, dropped from his school and joined the Army. He had been seriously wounded three times but survived and finished the war in Berlin - the 19 year old soldier with six medals for courage and heroism. He was a very good writer and I love his books ""Moment of Truth"" (""In the August of 1944""), and ""Zosya"" that were also adapted to very good movies in Russia.",5,Childhood Interrupted,1165363200,"12 6, 2006",2006,1448,"['first', 'full-length', 'feature', 'film', 'great', 'Russian', 'director', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'caused', 'sensation', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'shown', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', '1962', 'where', 'won', 'Golden', 'Lion', 'world', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'powerful', 'motion', 'picture', 'war', 'what', 'youngest', 'weakest', 'children', 'bleak', 'haunting', 'horrifying', 'portrait', 'lost', 'innocence', 'childhood', 'was', 'interrupted', 'very', 'day', 'boy', 'family', 'was', 'murdered', 'Ivan', 'survived', 'physically', 'was', 'changed', 'forever', 'not', 'boy', 'man', 'who', 'looked', 'eye', 'triumphant', 'death', 'horror', 'film', 'introduces', 'young', 'Nikolai', 'Kolya', 'Burlyaev', 'fascinating', 'performance', 'Ivan', 'Ivan', 'Childhood', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'story', 'Russian', 'writer', 'Vladimir', 'Bogomolov', 'Ivan', 'fiction', 'story', 'based', 'real', 'facts', 'Millions', 'young', 'boys', 'girls', 'perished', 'endless', 'days', 'months', 'years', 'worst', 'war', 'last', 'century', 'Bogomolov', 'fought', 'soldier', 'WWII', 'was', 'only', '15', 'years', 'old', 'had', 'forged', 'papers', 'added', 'two', 'years', 'dropped', 'school', 'joined', 'Army', 'had', 'been', 'seriously', 'wounded', 'three', 'times', 'survived', 'finished', 'war', 'Berlin', '19', 'year', 'old', 'soldier', 'six', 'medals', 'courage', 'heroism', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'writer', 'love', 'books', 'Moment', 'Truth', 'August', '1944', 'Zosya', 'were', 'also', 'adapted', 'very', 'good', 'movies', 'Russia']",N/A

833291,A1BQPKQHV78M8,B0002HMKA4,Raul Vasquez,"[4, 4]","In 1962 Andrei Tarkovsky made an incredible directing debut with his film ""Ivan's Childhood"" (aka My Name is Ivan).  ""Ivan's Childhood"" is an extremely powerful film that shows the worst effects a war can have.  In this way, it is similar to the 1959 Russian anti-war film ""The Ballad of a Soldier"".  Both films are similar in that they each emphasize the fact that war tears families apart.  In ""The Ballad of a Soldier"" this heartfelt truth is ultimately grasped through the point of view of a mother, while in ""Ivan's Childhood"", it is perceived through the eyes of a twelve-year old boy.I must admit that I found ""Ivan's Childhood"" to be very moving.  In the movie it is sad to see the ongoing image of Ivan riding in a wagon with his sister, since it is a memory that Ivan longs for but ultimately knows will never occur.  The war has after all robbed Ivan of his family, his childhood, and his innocence.  Ivan is therefore left a bitter twelve-year old who now thirsts for vengeance, not being able to enjoy a day at the beach or wagon ride through the forest like any other child. I will proceed no further with the details of the plot, since I do not wish to spoil a movie that I highly recommend. I however do wish to state that the movie is an excellent example of Tarkovsky's early genius.  It serves as a precursor to Tarkovsky's many great films.  In fact, ""Ivan's Childhood"" has some similar qualities of his greatest film ""Andrei Rublev"". Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov, who composed the soundtrack to ""Ivan's Childhood"", also wrote the music to ""Andrei Rublev"".  Furthermore, Ivan is played by Nikolai Burlyayev, who also plays Boriska ""the bell-boy"" in Andrei Rublev.In summary ""Ivan's Childhood"" is a must see movie despite it not being a war film. On the contrary, it is an anti-war film.  Therefore the action is limited but the ill effects of the war are still thoroughly felt.  Tarkovsky even as a ""rookie"" director making his debut has created a more profound art piece than someone like Spielberg ever could.The DVD release by Russico is decent. The picture quality is good for a black and white film. The picture I believe was only filmed in a full screen format.  I bought Russico's release after wasting countless emails to Criterion Collection to release their own copy.  All I received were empty promises that it was to be released in Fall 2002! Well behold it has not even been released Fall 2004. It is suffice to say that Russico's version is well worth buying.",5,A powerful film on the loss of innocence,1106352000,"01 22, 2005",2005,2487,"['1962', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'made', 'incredible', 'directing', 'debut', 'film', 'Ivan', 'Childhood', 'My', 'Name', 'Ivan', 'Ivan', 'Childhood', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'film', 'worst', 'effects', 'war', 'can', 'have', 'way', 'similar', '1959', 'Russian', 'anti-war', 'film', 'Ballad', 'Soldier', 'films', 'are', 'similar', 'emphasize', 'fact', 'war', 'tears', 'families', 'apart', 'Ballad', 'Soldier', 'heartfelt', 'truth', 'ultimately', 'grasped', 'point', 'view', 'mother', 'Ivan', 'Childhood', 'perceived', 'eyes', 'twelve-year', 'old', 'boy.I', 'must', 'admit', 'found', 'Ivan', 'Childhood', 'be', 'very', 'moving', 'movie', 'sad', 'see', 'ongoing', 'image', 'Ivan', 'riding', 'wagon', 'sister', 'memory', 'Ivan', 'ultimately', 'knows', 'will', 'never', 'occur', 'war', 'robbed', 'Ivan', 'family', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'Ivan', 'therefore', 'left', 'bitter', 'twelve-year', 'old', 'who', 'now', 'vengeance', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'enjoy', 'day', 'beach', 'wagon', 'ride', 'forest', 'other', 'child', 'will', 'proceed', 'further', 'details', 'plot', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'spoil', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'however', 'do', 'wish', 'state', 'movie', 'excellent', 'example', 'Tarkovsky', 'early', 'genius', 'precursor', 'Tarkovsky', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'fact', 'Ivan', 'Childhood', 'similar', 'qualities', 'greatest', 'film', 'Andrei', 'Rublev', 'Vyacheslav', 'Ovchinnikov', 'who', 'composed', 'soundtrack', 'Ivan', 'Childhood', 'also', 'wrote', 'music', 'Andrei', 'Rublev', 'Furthermore', 'Ivan', 'played', 'Nikolai', 'Burlyayev', 'who', 'also', 'Boriska', 'bell-boy', 'Andrei', 'Rublev.In', 'summary', 'Ivan', 'Childhood', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'being', 'war', 'film', 'contrary', 'anti-war', 'film', 'action', 'limited', 'ill', 'effects', 'war', 'are', 'still', 'thoroughly', 'felt', 'Tarkovsky', 'even', 'rookie', 'director', 'making', 'debut', 'created', 'more', 'profound', 'art', 'piece', 'someone', 'Spielberg', 'ever', 'DVD', 'release', 'Russico', 'decent', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'picture', 'believe', 'was', 'only', 'filmed', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'bought', 'Russico', 'release', 'wasting', 'countless', 'emails', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'release', 'own', 'copy', 'received', 'were', 'empty', 'promises', 'was', 'be', 'released', 'Fall', '2002', 'Well', 'not', 'even', 'been', 'released', 'Fall', '2004', 'suffice', 'say', 'Russico', 'version', 'well', 'worth', 'buying']",N/A
833292,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B0002HMKA4,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","Ivan's Childhood amazes with the fluidity of its camerawork, its wonderful use of sound and its matter of fact depiction of war - not the moments of combat that make up only a tiny part of the experience, but the moments between, where people try to catch whatever they can, be it love, hope, memories or just sleep. It's a simple tale extraordinarily well told, and if the sudden leap in chronology at the end is jarring, the result is nonetheless very moving. Even the fantasy/memory scenes of a nature more vivid that the burnt out husk or swamps of war are beautifully handled, and it's easy to see this being a major influence on Spielberg's most underrated film, Empire of the Sun. Very impressive, it was a surprise to learn from the DVD that the film was shot on an ultra-low budget because another director and cast had used up half the budget before their version was scrubbed, only for Kruschev's disapproval to limit the film's Russian release while it was conquering the arthouses worldwide.",4,Children of war,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,1004,"['Ivan', 'Childhood', 'fluidity', 'camerawork', 'wonderful', 'use', 'sound', 'matter', 'fact', 'depiction', 'war', 'not', 'moments', 'combat', 'make', 'up', 'only', 'tiny', 'part', 'experience', 'moments', 'where', 'people', 'try', 'catch', 'can', 'be', 'love', 'hope', 'memories', 'just', 'sleep', 'simple', 'tale', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'told', 'sudden', 'leap', 'chronology', 'end', 'jarring', 'result', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'moving', 'Even', 'fantasy/memory', 'scenes', 'nature', 'more', 'vivid', 'burnt', 'out', 'husk', 'swamps', 'war', 'are', 'beautifully', 'handled', 'easy', 'see', 'being', 'major', 'influence', 'Spielberg', 'most', 'underrated', 'film', 'Empire', 'Sun', 'Very', 'impressive', 'was', 'surprise', 'learn', 'DVD', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'ultra-low', 'budget', 'director', 'cast', 'had', 'used', 'up', 'budget', 'version', 'was', 'scrubbed', 'only', 'Kruschev', 'disapproval', 'limit', 'film', 'Russian', 'release', 'was', 'conquering', 'arthouses', 'worldwide']",N/A
