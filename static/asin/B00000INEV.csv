The dvd consists of images of items with a nursery rhyme or poem being recited in another language. The amazing thing is that the item shown has no relation to the words being spoken! It might as well be completely random sounds, since anyone who has studied child language acquisition knows that babies learn from making observations of language used in context. While I understand that supposedly this DVD is only intended to 'stimulate' the brain, by six months, a baby's brain has developed specifically to hone in on the sounds presented in his own native language, and to selectively ignore others. The brain continues to prune and forge neural networks in response to sounds from the language spoken in the home, thus the idea that random speech sounds are somehow beneficially stiumlating is invalid. A baby's brain becomes stimulated by the sounds that appear repeatedly in his own language. Habituation and imaging studies have shown this time and time again. Imagine if the baby's brain gave equal attention to any sound--the brain would waste valuable time and resources on information that would not be useful in learning to communicate with his caretakers. We acquire langauge so rapidly because the brain is selective.Babies depend heavily on repitition, adult modeling, observing cause and effect, and from watching other people's behaviors to learn language. The idea that your child with learn anything from just hearing forgien language sounds out of context is very silly. If you want your child to learn language sounds and words from a language not spoken in the home, try exposing him to another language speaker on a routine basis, or show him programs like Dora or Sesame Street, where there is lots of explicit context to help a baby infer meaning, clear annunciation, and repition.",1,Terrible-don't waste your money,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,1862,"['supposed', ""'language"", 'lab', 'VERY', 'poorly', 'designed', 'dvd', 'images', 'items', 'nursery', 'rhyme', 'poem', 'being', 'recited', 'language', 'amazing', 'thing', 'item', 'shown', 'relation', 'words', 'being', 'spoken', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'completely', 'random', 'sounds', 'anyone', 'who', 'studied', 'child', 'language', 'acquisition', 'babies', 'learn', 'making', 'observations', 'language', 'used', 'context', 'understand', 'supposedly', 'DVD', 'only', 'intended', ""'stimulate"", 'brain', 'six', 'months', 'baby', 'brain', 'developed', 'specifically', 'hone', 'sounds', 'presented', 'own', 'native', 'language', 'selectively', 'ignore', 'others', 'brain', 'prune', 'forge', 'neural', 'networks', 'response', 'sounds', 'language', 'spoken', 'home', 'thus', 'idea', 'speech', 'sounds', 'are', 'somehow', 'beneficially', 'stiumlating', 'invalid', 'baby', 'brain', 'becomes', 'stimulated', 'sounds', 'appear', 'repeatedly', 'own', 'language', 'Habituation', 'imaging', 'studies', 'have', 'shown', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'Imagine', 'baby', 'brain', 'gave', 'equal', 'attention', 'sound', 'brain', 'would', 'waste', 'valuable', 'time', 'resources', 'information', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'useful', 'learning', 'communicate', 'caretakers', 'acquire', 'langauge', 'so', 'rapidly', 'brain', 'selective.Babies', 'depend', 'heavily', 'repitition', 'adult', 'modeling', 'observing', 'cause', 'effect', 'watching', 'other', 'people', 'behaviors', 'learn', 'language', 'idea', 'child', 'learn', 'anything', 'just', 'hearing', 'forgien', 'language', 'context', 'very', 'silly', 'want', 'child', 'learn', 'language', 'sounds', 'words', 'language', 'not', 'spoken', 'home', 'try', 'exposing', 'language', 'speaker', 'routine', 'basis', 'show', 'programs', 'Dora', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'where', 'lots', 'explicit', 'context', 'help', 'baby', 'infer', 'meaning', 'clear', 'annunciation', 'repition']",Baby Einstein VHS

When I first read the title ""Language Nursery"" I thought they would show things and then name the things in English....kind of like an English vocabulary builder.  Boy, was I way off.I popped in the dvd and began watching.  It started speaking a different language.  It sounded like German.  So, I stopped it and went to the Main Menu to try to change it so it would be in English.  I tried it and again it was speaking in German.  I spent 5 minutes trying to change the language to English and then found out that the joke was on me, LOL, because the settings weren't wrong afterall.  It's supposed to start speaking in German.  It will show shapes, toys, patterns, etc and the voices are speaking in different languages.  The languages spoken are German, French, Hebrew, Japanese, Russian, Spanish and English.  12 minutes into the dvd they speak English for about 10 seconds.In English they count while showing the face of a clock.  Clock hands are going around the clock.  Common sense would tell you to count the same numbers that the hand is pointing to.  But, no.  When they count 1 the hand in on the 7.  So, all the numbers that are counted and the numbers the hands point to don't match at all.  When they speak Spanish, they say the alphabet in Spanish.  You would think that they would show the letters of the alphabet.  No.  They show spinning toys.  So, how is a child supposed to know that they are even saying the alphabet in Spanish?  They go on and on with a story about a mouse and a cat (I can't remember what langauge this was....Spanish maybe?).  The entire time the story is being told they show a spinning pinwheel.  How is a child supposed to know that they are talking about a cat and a mouse?This says it is for babies 1 - 18 months old.  Come on!  This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen and heard.  If you want to expose your child to languages I really don't think this is the way to do it.  They will never know what in the world is being spoken.  I would think you should pick a video that has all of one foreign language on it, not seven.  My 12 year old came into the room while I was watching this.  She watched it a few minutes and said, ""How do you even know what they are saying?""  I said, ""You don't"".This is just very odd and I would think it could be very confusing for a baby.  There is absolutely no translation.  So, even as an adult watching this you have no clue what they are saying in Japanese, Hebrew, etc.  You don't know if they are counting, saying the alphabet, or what in the world they are saying.  How this is supposed to be a good thing to watch I just have no idea.One recent reviewer said that from watching this dvd her ""son is now fluent in Japanese, Russian, Hebrew, French, and Portuguese"".  I question whether her son is actually ""fluent"" in these languages or has he just memorized what is being spoken.  That isn't a bad thing, but it really isn't being fluent if you don't have any idea what the translation is (in other words, if you don't even know what you are saying).  And an fyi, I don't believe that Portuguese is one of the languages taught.  I really wouldn't have given this any star but Amazon won't allow that.

Play-involves using different colorful moving toys, colorful shapes, and other objects to engage the child in some form of visual play while the speaker counts, sings, or tells a short story in a specific language. The problem with this part is that the languages change back and forth. One minute it's French, the next its something else. You can't select the language of your choice, here! It just bounces around, back and forth!!! It's totally disorganized! I got confused!2.There is a section called Bonus material. In this area, you can select a specific language and here it teaches the child to count to twenty, names of a few fruits i.e apple, banana, grapes, animals... cow, duck, goat, and other items (clock,train). The bonus area is very brief. Not much of a bonus.Then the DVD has an area where it offers you an opportunity to purchase some of the items used in the program ( some of the toys); most have been discontinued.Also, some areas in the program play the music so loud that it's difficult to hear the lesson. The program offers French, English, Spanish, Hebrew, Italian,Russian, Japanese, and German.The program is 30 minutes long;this includes the introduction and the sales pitch at the end.

There are lots of shapes and colors and moving objects that hold the eye of your baby while the narrators say things (counting numbers, reciting the alphabet, singing songs, etc) in various languages.  If it is important to expose a child's mind to different languages early, then this video is really invaluable.However, the video does not come with a script or information sheet about what the narrators are saying, so parents can't sing along easily or repeat what was just said.  Without this, the video is a one-way street with random, incomprehensible babble going from the TV to the baby.The only other problem with the video is the choice of some imagery.  Specifically, I mean the little black girl doll and the white sheep toy with the bobbing head.  These two images are incredibly creepy.  I think they may bother me more than they bother my kid, though, as he doesn't seem to be frightened by anything on the video.Don't go into this expecting to teach your child a foreign language.  This video simply can't do that.  However, it does provide exposure to the phonemes of foreign languages so that language acquisition later in life ought to be easier and foreign pronunciations more easily picked up.My kid loves the video, and that is what matters to me.

At first he would just stare in amazement at the screen; now he laughes and ""talks"" to the screen.  I expected that he would like Baby Neptune as well.  He gets so excited when he sees the green FBI warning, knowing that one of his movies is beginning.  He watched the first few minutes of Baby Neptune and then started screaming.  Instead of the lovely music, shapes, and colors like other Baby Einstein videos, Baby Neptune has real life footage -- children playing in a puddle  of water, a whale jumping out of the sea, etc.  Definitely not so exciting to a four month old.

Julie Clark has chosen to mark this video from birth to eighteen months, but I disagree. My son did not take interest in this video until 9 months. He is now nineteen months and his interest in it has grown as he has gotten older. Although I consider Julie Clark a brillant woman for creating this video series, I think she should have used a professional voice-over for the American segments rather than her own voice. Her voice lacks &quot;umph&quot; and comes across as boring and unstimulating.
