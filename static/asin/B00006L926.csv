""Sunshine State"" has a lot of great characters with a lot of great promise. That's the good, as well as, the bad part for this picture.The cast delivers an A-list performance and you're quickly drawn into the story centered around an old beach community. There's plots that branch off from the main theme dealing with homecomings, an old community scandal, issues concerning today's crumbling families, hanging onto tradition while making room for progress-I could go on and on. You sit and fully invest yourself in these people but in the end the plot is just a snap shot in the life of these characters. This thing could have been a series, or at least, a mini-series and I could have kept coming back. In the end I was just teased and left wanting to know how they all came out. Loose endings in a movie I don't mind but not this many. Obviously that's what writer and director John Sayles wanted the viewer to leave with at the closing credits. All those questions which the viewer has to resolve for themselves. Too many for my book but make a sequel and I'll be there.",3,Whoa!

It is about the lives and dreams of those who live there; about those who have left and returned; and those who have never left, but want to. It is about dreams: dreams of individuals and dreams held by parents for their children. &quot;Sunshine State&quot; has a unique perspective.Sayles examines each of his characters with great affection, it seems. No one is all-good or all-bad.....there is a lot of &quot;middle of the road&quot; here, mostly decent people. He lovingly develops his characters slowly and thoughtfully, and never judges these folks, no matter what they decide to do or not do.The slow, but never boring, pace of this movie allows the viewer to get involved in the lives of its characters, all of whom are played to perfection by fairly high-profile actors (Angela Bassett, Edir Falco, Timothy Hutton, Mary Steenburgen, and Alan King, among others).

This film intertwines several story lines to make a whole about the loss of old Florida, along the northern east coast, though the geography in the film is a bit muddled. The characters are at Weekie Watchie one minute, and that is all the way across the state on the west coast north of Tampa. Then they appear to be in a fictional Daytona Beach area, but somewhat north of the real location way over on the northern east coast. The scenery is lush, but the story line is a bit pallid.

In some ways it resembles two other movies of this type: Wilby Wonderful, and The June Bug. In fact Sunshine State and Wilby Wonderful both have a character who wanders through the movie trying to find a way to kill himself. Two threads that run through this story are a town's annual celebration, and the coming of land developers. These are not dominant plot elements, however, rather they seem to flow along under the surface, and break through at odd moments during the film. So we are left mostly to meeting and learning about several of the town's inhabitants. The difficulty in such a movie is to create interesting people who are not just stereotypes.Edie Falco, as the woman who manages a motel and restaurant for her almost blind father, does extremely well. You catch her frustration in being burdened with a job that she doesn't want. She is an intelligent person who had wanted to be an oceanographer. Her father, who has a small part, is interesting as a man who struggles with his conservative and sometimes racist views in a changing world. Other inhabitants of Sunshine State border on the ordinary. While they provide us with modest interest, scenes often linger too long on them. Other folks who might be interesting are left in the shadows.All in all I found this movie to be less satisfying than the other two films that I mentioned above: Wilby Wonderful, and The June Bug.

There are five stories going at once, and they are treated with delicacy and depth.  The pace is brisk and the script is tight.  The plot is described in other reviews.The movie is marred by Sayles's usual leftist preaching style.  All of the corporation executives are evil, town officials are corrupt and rude, all of the blacks are good (two hold doctorates), and there are some strong and at times muddled statements about civil rights.  Preaching aside, there is  a melodramatic aspect to the film that may turn off some viewers.

Another is Desiree (Angela Bassett), who has returned to confront her painful past and try to create a new and more understanding relationship with her mother. Many other stories also unfold, with charm and humor, as the movie winds towards a resolution.Some people may find this film rather slow.

He is able to take seemingly unrelated stories and create a wonderful film. His work, including Limbo, Eight Men Out, Lone Star, and Matewan are all movies that make you think. I would have liked more extras on this DVD, but Sayles commentary is interesting and does provide some insight into the movie making process. The movie, about developers moving into a little town in Florida and the effect on the town, looks at class and race differences and provides a different look at Florida, much like Limbo did for Alaska. The cast is really good, led by Edie Falco, who provides a Oscar worthy performance as a ""motelier"" who wants more out of life but doesn't seem to want it enough to leave, and by Angela Bassett, who did leave and maybe is wondering what she got of life by leaving. Bill Cobbs and TYimothy Hutton also provide solid performances in this movie. As I indictaed, the lack of extras is disappointing, but the movie itself is a gem.

719823,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B00006L926,D. Hartley,"[3, 3]","John Sayles returns to his Altmanesque ""Lone Star"" formula, with mixed results. Instead of a small town in Texas, a sleepy little resort community in Florida is put under the microscope. Once again, Sayles juggles about a half-dozen subplots that eventually tie together, although in a somewhat less compelling fashion than his Texas tale. The now-familiar Sayles themes of family ties, bittersweet love stories, culture clash and community traditions are trotted out and examined. The film opens strong, with greedy land developers descending on quirky small-town landowners, initially leading the viewer to think they are headed for a picaresque Carl Hiaasen-flavored social satire. Instead, we are given a deliberately paced, almost Mike Leigh (""Secrets and Lies"")-style glimpse into the lives of several families. The various little epiphanies that result are, at best, only a little interesting. Sayles is an actor's director, and while that usually guarantees good performances (which this film does have), it doesn't necessarily guarantee a riveting story. In fact, there are so many good actors in the huge cast (Edie Falco, Tim Hutton, Angela Bassett, Ralph Waite, Jane Alexander, Mary Steenburgen, etc.) that it's almost distracting, since no one stays on screen for very long at any given time.

There is the element of racism conquered (or is it?), a returning 'lost daughter' (Angela Bassett), a frustrated woman (Edie Falco, in a touching and very Southern role)left to run a motel and restaurant for her diabtetic father rather than follow her dreams, an orphan who witnessed his parents murder/suicide, a committed do-gooder (Mary Steenburgen) whose whole life seems tied up in a silly weekend Bucaneer Days celebration, and a misplaced Sarah Bernhardt (so good to see Jane Alexander back in the movies) trying to bring some semblance of culture to the resort folk, etc etc.  What we are given is a slice of small town mentality fighting to stay afloat and Sayles elicits fine performances from a sterling cast.

Over the years he has consistently directed fine independent movies. I thus expected much from this movie and was not disappointed.The out-of-state developers have descended on Delrona Beach and Lincon Beach, Florida. They want to bring progress in the form of &quot;plantations,&quot; planned resorts, golf courses, etc. If you are interested in how timely this subject is, spend a day driving down A-1A in Florida. Then there's Disney World in the middle of the state.

She says something to the effect that she's good at finance since she has run a nonprofit theatre group for 25 years. A word about Falco: you totally forget that she is a big part of &quot;The Sopranos.&quot; It's good to know that there is life for her outside that show.

(over)developers have come to renovate a sleepy island town and some of the inhabitants are rather reticent about seeing their heritage replaced with convenience stores and condos. this is the premise, and from here, Sayles lets the characters take over, and in no hurry. they are all interesting enough, though, to hold our attention and are extremely believable (they could all be my neighbors). the most endearing character for me, though, is the locale itself, replete with gators, mom-and-pop stores, scars of segregation (people forget mickey's winter home is below the mason-dixon), gators, greedy commercialists, seminoles-gone-redneck, southern rock bands, and retirees. i may be biased, but this film is the transcendance of the mundane at its best",5,and they wondered why those hanging chads and butterfly ballots were so problematic,1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,1297,"['sayles', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'underrated', 'filmmakers', 'day', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'made', 'hit', 'indie-hipster', 'crowd', 'i', 'guess', 'wry', 'humor', 'may', 'be', 'lost', 'other', '49', 'states', 'being', 'third', 'generation', 'floridian', 'plan', 'visiting', 'florida', 'really', 'oughta', 'watch', 'movie', 'first', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'place', 'better', 'afterwards', 'movie', 'shot', 'entirely', 'location', 'number', 'places', 'i', ""'ve"", 'been', 'numerous', 'times', 'really', 'nailed', 'beat', 'slice-of-life', 'kind', 'film', 'developers', 'have', 'come', 'renovate', 'sleepy', 'island', 'town', 'inhabitants', 'are', 'rather', 'reticent', 'seeing', 'heritage', 'replaced', 'convenience', 'stores', 'condos', 'premise', 'here', 'Sayles', 'characters', 'take', 'hurry', 'are', 'interesting', 'enough', 'though', 'hold', 'attention', 'are', 'extremely', 'believable', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'neighbors', 'most', 'endearing', 'character', 'though', 'locale', 'replete', 'gators', 'mom-and-pop', 'stores', 'scars', 'segregation', 'people', 'forget', 'mickey', 'winter', 'home', 'mason-dixon', 'gators', 'greedy', 'commercialists', 'seminoles-gone-redneck', 'southern', 'rock', 'bands', 'retirees', 'i', 'may', 'be', 'biased', 'film', 'transcendance', 'mundane', 'best']",Sunshine State

Each scene roped you in just enough that you felt something was going to happen worth enough to continue paying attention to it.  No, it never did.

I don't mind watching a sleeper where it's a 'talkie' picture, but there has to be something there to keep one interested.  The pay off at the end was disappointing and lasted about a minute.

719830,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B00006L926,Linda Linguvic,"[5, 5]","Set in Florida, this somewhat offbeat film was directed by John Sayles.  At first it seems like another one of those ""big business versus the little guy"" films because the central theme is about a land developer wanting to buy the homes and businesses of the local population.  Also, as one section of the beach is where aspiring black families built their homes years before, it seems like it might have a racial theme.  But times have changed, and so have the movies.  There's more to this story than age-old conflicts.  There are the real issues about dreams of parents not necessarily being the dreams of the children.For example, take Edie Falco, cast as the daughter of a motel owner.  Her father is half blind and aging; her mother, Jane Alexander, is a flaky drama teacher who turns out to be quite an astute businesswoman.  Edie has had a failed marriage, hates the motel and would like to sell out.  She's tired of her life in which her most cherished success was working as a swimming mermaid in a tank in a restaurant.  ""The important thing was to keep a smile on your face, even while you're drowning,"" she says to Tim Hutton, an architect for the development, who dreams of creating beautiful landscapes.Then there's Angela Basset and her husband James McDaniel.  She's been away for 25 years because her mother, Eunice Stokes, sent her away when she was 15.  This trip home opens old wounds, as the former football star who made her pregnant is now an unsuccessful car salesman who is exploiting his heritage to make buck.  There's also a young troubled cousin who she tries to help.In the meantime, the town is having a pageant and Mary Steenburger is in charge.  And Alan King and a couple of cronies appear from time to time playing golf and making jokes.  There's even a work gang of white rednecks who work side by side with a Seminole Indian who knows how to talk back to them.  There's a lot going on in the film.  Some of it quite subliminal.The acting was uniformly good, but not outstanding.  Mostly, because there were so many characters that no one particularly stood out.  The writing was good enough to keep the plot moving and I wasn't confused about their complex relationships at any time. The best parts of the film though were the clever lines, which were constant and added a little ""ting"" to the story.  The film was 141 minutes long, and even though I wasn't bored, I would have liked to push it along during the slow parts.  And some of it was a little too low key for my taste because I tend to like more high drama and action.Sunshine State is modern, witty and allegorical.
