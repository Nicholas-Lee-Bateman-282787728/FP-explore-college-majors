1215527,A3H1PU959E7MXG,B001LPWGCS,"clarence a connelly, jr.","[0, 0]",The film Everybody Wants To Be Italian is far from being a great movie but it is is entertaining.  Jay Jablonski and Cerina Vincent are very engaging and attractive characters as are Marissa Potroro.  Penny Marshall is underutilized.  The premise is that Jake and Marissa both pretend to be Italian but in the end it turns out that neither of them are.  Jake is in a delusional relationship with a woman that he used to date eight years ago and at first it seems like he will do anything possible to get her back but then he meets the doctor who is six years older than he is and he slowly begins to be entralled by her and vice versa.The men who work with him in the fish market that he owns counsel him to forget the old girlfriend who is now married with three children and concentrate on the doctor until they discover that Marissa is anxious to have children as her biological clock is ticking.I liked the movie and would recommend it to others but do not expect greatness but merely a good movie and a good time.  It is a little offbeat.  All the characters are well drawn.,3,"Engaging Characters, Good Premise, Well executed",1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,1079,"['film', 'Everybody', 'Be', 'Italian', 'far', 'being', 'great', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'Jay', 'Jablonski', 'Cerina', 'Vincent', 'are', 'very', 'engaging', 'attractive', 'characters', 'are', 'Marissa', 'Potroro', 'Penny', 'Marshall', 'underutilized', 'premise', 'Jake', 'Marissa', 'pretend', 'be', 'Italian', 'end', 'out', 'are', 'Jake', 'delusional', 'relationship', 'woman', 'used', 'date', 'eight', 'years', 'ago', 'first', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'possible', 'get', 'back', 'then', 'doctor', 'who', 'six', 'years', 'older', 'slowly', 'be', 'entralled', 'vice', 'versa.The', 'men', 'who', 'work', 'fish', 'market', 'counsel', 'forget', 'old', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'now', 'married', 'three', 'children', 'concentrate', 'doctor', 'discover', 'Marissa', 'anxious', 'have', 'children', 'biological', 'clock', 'ticking.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'greatness', 'merely', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'time', 'little', 'offbeat', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'drawn']",Everybody Wants To Be Italian

1215529,A16IM9MYTHCKYQ,B001LPWGCS,Penumbra,"[4, 7]","""Everybody Wants to be Italian"" is to romantic comedy what ""The Producers"" intended ""Springtime for Hitler"" to be to musicals but in a more earnest and unfunny way, and without the catchy tunes. The fatal flaw in this movie is that the writers apparently thought the comedy would come from making the leading man into an unlikeable, obnoxious, borderline psycho creep. (Note to writers: in a romantic comedy it is not a good thing when the audience is rooting for the leading lady to dump the hero.)Jake Bianski (Jay Jablonski), is a Polish guy who owns a fish monger shop in a very Italian neighborhood. He refuses to believe that his relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Isabella, is really over. At every opportunity he stalks and harasses her trying to convince her to get back together. It's not going to happen. Isabella married someone else eight years ago and they now have three small children. Although the oldest child was born more than a year after the break up, Jake often (loudly and publicly proclaims himself the boy's father. To make matters worse, the reason for the break up was that Jake slept with Isabella's best friend...and her sister...in her parents' bed. (Note to writers: In the Romantic Comedy (AKA: Chick Flick) genre, it's better when the chicks in the audience aren't considering the hero and saying, ""eeeeww[...]"")When Jake's very concerned friends and co-workers meet Marissa Costa (Cerina Vincent), a girl looking for a stray cat in an alley, they convince her to go to a neighborhood dance to meet their ""available"" buddy. Since they assume Marrissa is Italian, they tell Jake he must pretend to be Italian or she won't be interested in him. They introduce him as Jake Bianci and hope nature take its course. Marrisa, who is from a Spanish family, is also pretending to be Italian, hence the title.After this really rocky set up, I wish I could tell you it gets better. But, at its best, this movie is... meh.The residents of the mostly Italian neighborhood are sweet, funny, and endearing as they offer advice to the young couple. The three guys who work in the fish shop are delightful. Steve Bottino (John Kapelos) is working while studying for his PhD in Psychology. Gianluca Tempesti (John Enos III) is a tough guy who is studying English literature at night. Papa Aldo Tempesti (Richard Libertini) is the elderly father who has some great observations and a dead pan delivery.Two stars for the charming Miss Vincent, the supporting cast and the very nice location shots around Boston.

Jake becomes an all out fool every year on their old anniversary, parading around the city purchasing a new suit, ring, flowers(apparently he couldn't splurge for the brain instead) and attempts to woo his soul mate once more.Then along comes Marisa(Cerina Vincent) a beautiful veterinarian, whom Jake's Tweedledee & Tweedledum-esque friends Steve(John Kapelos) and Gianluca(John Enos III) find and persuade into meeting their single(they forgot to mention psychotic) friend.Somehow Jake and Marisa begin to nurture a friendship, though Jake insists he still has a girlfriend, therefore they cannot be more.Of course Jake eventually finds out he really does love Marisa and follows her to the ends of the earth(or in this case, just Italy) to involve her in his schizophrenic mind, and propose to her.(Forget trying a relationship, you bag-o-crazy)The film drags along, so very slowly and all you do is wait and pray for some sort of redemption that never comes.If I didn't already, I'm sure I don't want to be Italian now.",1,"If I were Italian, I'd be offended.",1237766400,"03 23, 2009",2009,1701,"['2007', 'answer', ""'My"", 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'have', 'come', 'shoddy', 'package', ""'Everybody"", 'Wants', 'Be', 'Italian', 'long', 'painful', ""'romantic"", 'comedy', 'Just', 'saying', 'feels', ""'m"", 'lying', 'favor', 'Really', 'nothing', 'funny', 'case', 'romantic', 'either.Jake', 'Bianski', 'played', 'Jay', 'Jablonski', 'so', 'creative', 'character', 'naming', 'entirely', 'unlikeable', 'bozo', 'who', 'fish', 'market', 'help', 'much', 'older', 'still', 'just', 'idiotic', 'Italian', 'friends.Jake', 'strange', 'illusion', 'still', 'involved', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Isabella', 'Marisa', 'Petroro', 'married', 'three', 'children', 'completely', 'uninterested', 'Jake', 'out', 'fool', 'year', 'old', 'anniversary', 'parading', 'city', 'purchasing', 'new', 'suit', 'ring', 'flowers', 'apparently', 'could', ""n't"", 'splurge', 'brain', 'instead', 'attempts', 'woo', 'soul', 'mate', 'once', 'more.Then', 'Marisa', 'Cerina', 'Vincent', 'beautiful', 'veterinarian', 'whom', 'Jake', 'Tweedledee', 'Tweedledum-esque', 'friends', 'Steve', 'John', 'Kapelos', 'Gianluca', 'John', 'Enos', 'III', 'find', 'persuade', 'meeting', 'single', 'forgot', 'mention', 'psychotic', 'friend.Somehow', 'Jake', 'Marisa', 'begin', 'nurture', 'friendship', 'Jake', 'still', 'girlfriend', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'more.Of', 'course', 'Jake', 'eventually', 'out', 'really', 'love', 'Marisa', 'ends', 'earth', 'case', 'just', 'Italy', 'involve', 'schizophrenic', 'mind', 'propose', 'Forget', 'trying', 'relationship', 'bag-o-crazy', 'film', 'along', 'so', 'very', 'slowly', 'do', 'wait', 'pray', 'sort', 'redemption', 'never', 'comes.If', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', ""'m"", 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'Italian', 'now']",Everybody Wants To Be Italian
