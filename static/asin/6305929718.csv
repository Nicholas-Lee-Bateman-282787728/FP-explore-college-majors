483262,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305929718,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Racial stereotypes abound in this widely loved film about a white basketball player who teams up with a fast talking black guy to swindle unsuspecting b-ballers out of some quick cash.  The thing is, the stereotypes are what make this film work, so they are not only forgiven, they are warranted.  The basic plot is simple (if not a tad clich&eacute;d) and the performances by the entire cast are uniformly great, with Rosie Perez standing out as the undeniable center of attention (she's on FIRE here).  My only qualm is that the character of Sidney becomes somewhat unlikable and remains that way.  I didn't really understand the friendship even though the chemistry was pitch-perfect.  I loved the ending, to be honest, because it broke away from the expected and made Billy's issues more complex and relatable.  It's funny, fast paced and engaging.

Get it at Amazon.]This is not a comedy.  This is a Basketball Jones fantasy.  It's gritty and full of low rent district locales in SoCal: Watts, Venice Beach, South Central L.A., maybe East L.A..  There's a lot of trash talk and mother talk, some of it funny.  This is about a white dude who is black even though he is as white as Gomer Pyle.  And about as smart.  This is about being white in a black world.  It's about being a loser as far as women are concerned.  This is about being a loser period.Woody Harrelson as Billy Hoyle is the loser.  Wesley Snipes as Sidney Dean is the hotshot, hotdog, street wise hoops hustler who sees some value in an undersized white guy who plays better than he looks, although he can't jump.  In a sense this is a buddy movie, 1990s style.  They team up and hustle two-on-two pickup basketball for cash on outdoor courts with metal nets.  They're good and they usually win.This is also about their relationship with their women.  Rosie Perez plays Gloria Clemente who is a bit too smart for Billy.  She spends her time imbibing endless trivia in prep for being on TV's Jeopardy.  Tyra Ferrell plays Sidney's wife.  She's also smarter than her man but long suffering in the ghetto.  Some real life hoopsters make an appearance.  I spotted Marques Johnson and Nigel Miguel, both of whom played for UCLA.  Ron Shelton, who wrote and directed the excellent baseball movie Bull Durham (1988) wrote and directed here.  He does a good job although I do have some points to make.One, you can't hustle hoops in the manner depicted.  The main problem is the officiating.  There is no way to settle disputes about fouls and who touched the ball last when going out of bounds.  I played pickup basketball all over the South Bay area of Los Angeles for decades and I can tell you that when the games were close every missed shot was a foul, and the only way it got settled was to ""shoot for it""; that is, the guy who claimed he was fouled when he missed the shot had to ""do or die"" from the free throw line or (more often in the bigger games) from the top of the key.  If he makes it, his team gets the ball out of bounds.  If he misses, the other team gets the ball.  If you're playing for some serious money, these disputes would go on forever, not to mention the fact that somebody might just lay some hard fouls on somebody and what you would end up with is the bigger, tough guys winning.  In fact, if one team is about to win against a bigger, badder team they might NEVER get a shot off.A secondary problem is the white ringer deal only works once.In reality there is enough ego involvement in these pickup games that you don't need to put any money on the line.  Your self-identity as a basketball player is already on the line.  Additionally, most guys who play pickup basketball play it for recreation, for staying in shape, for camaraderie.  And yes there are some VERY serious pickup games with some very good players all over the Los Angeles area, although the best of them are played in high school, JC or college gyms indoors.  Incidentally, by the time this movie was produced (it came out in 1992) most of the games in the L.A. area were played full court, not two on two; and before that, going back to the sixties, the default half court game was three on three.Well, in a Hollywood movie a realistic depiction of a milieu usually isn't the point.  The point is entertainment, and in this sense White Men Can't Jump does alright.  Snipes and Harrelson, by the way, can play a little, although it's mostly the camera work and the slow-mo that makes them look good.",3,Entertaining?  Yes.  Realistic?
