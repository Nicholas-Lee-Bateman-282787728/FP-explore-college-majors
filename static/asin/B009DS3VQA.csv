1595591,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B009DS3VQA,FYI,"[78, 81]","Previews of this series don't do justice to Martin Shaw's masterful, powerful acting, or the show's high-production values. Happily, although Series 1-2 were filmed in Ireland, all the subsequent collections are actually filmed in England's North Country, in Northumberland and Durham, a beautiful old city. So those of you who enjoyVeraare in for a treat. In the late 1960s, Inspector George Gently (Shaw), who had witnessed his lovely Italian wife's murder via a hit & run (Series One), is as honest and stalwart as they come. Martin Shaw is superb, as is his sidekick, Lee Ingleby, as Detective Sergeant John Bacchus. You may recall the fine Ingleby from his inimitable turn inHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, as the conductor of the Knight Bus, Stan Shunpike. Blessed with abundant talent and a memorable voice, Lee Ingleby is also pitch-perfect as the menacing Vic Tyler in the highly regarded 1970s police/time-travel hitLife On Mars (U.K.). Another constant is PC Taylor (Simon Hubbard), who grumblingly serves many a cuppa ofPG Tips Black Teawith plates of biscuits. World War II veteran George Gently mentors young John Bacchus, a young man desperately in need of guidance, adrift in the swirling social turmoil of the 1960s. Before moving on to Series Five, you don't want to miss evocative earlier episodes, such as ""Gently in the Blood "" in Series Two. It features another fine British actor, Andrew Lee-Potts (great inPrimeval, should be next Doctor Who).Thankfully, Series Five actually provides FOUR episodes, not the measly two as in Series 3 & 4! Series Five ends on a disturbing note, cliffhanger, where the fate of our main characters is unsure. But rest assured, another four episodes are being filmed in 2013. There are English subtitles, for those of us who do not want to miss one word. The run time is 354 minutes, plus a 3 minute bonus ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette; for a three-dimensional taste experience, you may want to indulge in some Northumberland style bangers & mash, with classic Newcastle Nut Brown Ale (a favorite of Bacchus') to top it off. Enjoy!Episode 1, ""Gently Northern Soul""Martin Luther King was assassinated on April 4th, 1968. Later that month, in Northumberland, 1968, the shadow of racist tension lurks, although young people are keen to get into a dance club where they can thrill to imported soul music. When a beautiful young black girl, Dolores Kenny (Pippa Bennett-Warner), is murdered after a night out, DCI George Gently (Martin Shaw) and Sergeant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby) discover not only ""racialism"" within the police force, but strong anti-immigrant feelings. Bacchus winds up falling for Delores' friend Carol Morford (the wonderful Lenora Crichlow,Being Human). Delores' father, Ambrose Kenny (Eamon Walker), is a WWII vet, now bus-driver, who has valiantly fought racism all his life, his son Joseph (Gary Carr) is less patient than his father. Yet beneath these tensions, other motivations may have been responsible for the murder. Gently and Bacchus fight to untangle a web of violence, while in one scene, a telly broadcasts the notorious ""Rivers of Blood"" speech. Weaving history and mystery, the Race Relations Act 1968, immanent in 1968, this is a topical, courageous story, with classic soul music.Episode 2, ""Gently with Class""British drama and mystery series often delve into frank discussions about ""class."" In this story, also set in Northumberland, 1968, a blue Austin A40 Farina, registered to local aristocrat, Hector Blackstone (the wonderful Richard Lloyd Pack, in ""Doc Martin"" andThe Vicar of Dibley), turns up crashed in a river. In the passenger seat is a drowned, beautiful young woman, and no driver is found. It seems that a local girl was abandoned to drown in the river alone, with no help from her date. It turns out that the victim was gifted musician and free-spirit Ellen Mallam (Ebony Buckle). Against the will of Hector's second wife, Countess Alethea Blackstone, Ellen had been involved with the Countess' son and heir-apparent, Lord James Blackstone. Ellen's father (wonderfully played by Christopher Fairbank), dying of throat cancer, is suspected when James is in hospital. Gently is furious when he discovers that Bacchus crossed a line due to his dislike for the Blackstone's snobbery and obstruction. Meanwhile, Gently, like Hector Blackstone, is haunted by the loss of his wife, plagued by dreams of drowning.Episode 3, ""The Lost Child""Camera gently panning a street in Durham, 1968, postwar families enjoy a ""lovely life."" Children play on sidewalks, mothers walk baby-filled prams, front yards are meticulously maintained, and nary a rose is out of place. This bucolic setting is suddenly disturbed when baby Faith is snatched from her crib, from her ""perfect"" home. She had been adopted three weeks ago by respectable, middle-class Stephen Groves and his wife Frances (pitch-perfectly played by Helen Baxendale). Suspicion initially falls on the birth mother, Susan Faulkner (luminous with Holly Lucas), whose heart is breaking for her lost daughter whilst she and her other baby, Faith's twin brother Thomas, find refuge by the sea with her friend Hazel Joyce (another gem, Faye Castelow). George Gently and John Bacchus discover that Susan had misgivings about putting her child up for adoption in the first place, and that both Susan and Hazel have reason to dislike the adoption agency's Mrs. Dunwoody (the always excellent Alison Steadman). Further investigation rolls across gorgeous Northumbrian moors, and our George (ex-boxer) makes a delightful threat against a suspect who'd better not try to abscond; a ransom note turns out to be blackmail. The Groves, Faith's well-off adoptive parents, come under suspicion. A mysterious young fellow named Gareth (Jordan Dawes) turns up, to tragic consequences. Meanwhile, George Gently expresses compassion to John Bacchus, who is trying to resolve old tension with his hyper-critical father Peter (the wonderful Tony Haygarth) and balance his relationship with his daughter Leigh Ann (young Katie Anderson is delightful, and Lee Ingleby works beautifully with her). Another fine episode, and clearly, the set designers, from clothes to props, had a ball.Episode 4, ""Gently in the Cathedral""In Durham, 1968, the forces of evil that tragically disrupted George Gently's life in 1964 re-emerge in this dark season closure. A young, newly married police officer, Gavin Henderson (Lee Armstrong), is murdered, leaving his pregnant wife Bernie (beautifully played by Angelica Penn) in dire straits. The force believes the death was suicide, so she can't rely on a pension or insurance for support. George Gently stands by her and tries to help, whist she moves to Rothbury. Meanwhile, Melvin Rattigan (Ralph Brown), a violent, notorious career criminal, is released from Durham Gaol early, after years of planning his revenge upon DCI Gently. Another criminal is found dead, but was he who he appeared to be, a bad bloke named Rivers? Our George made a number of enemies in his relentless pursuit of truth; he unearthed a myriad of police corruption during his career at the Met in London (and beyond). Foes have now cleared Rattigan on the grounds that any evidence against him was falsely concocted by Gently. Another detective is found murdered, D.S. Bill Denmore, turns out he was working undercover. In Durham, an old colleague, Donald McGhee (Kevin Whately, ofInspector Lewis) arrives, and soon after, George is accused of money fraud and murder, his world begins to crumble around him as the Fraud Squad entices DS John Bacchus (the great Lee Ingleby, also inThe Street)to provide evidence against his boss. A job at the Met is used to entice his ambition, and Bacchus' loyalty is tested to the limit. At least the tea and biscuit proffering DC Taylor (Simon Hubbard) defies the bullying, as does Bachuss' ex-wife Lisa (played with perfect-pitch by Melanie Clark Pullen). Gently is suspended, left in vulnerable position while he must face the past and fight for his reputation and his life. Ironically, one sanctuary is with Rattigan's defense lawyer, Gitta Bronson (the great Diana Quick, also inCase Histories - Series 2), and her delightful, eccentric butler Tim (Philip Fox). Gently must fight for his life against deep-seated corruption in a classic cliff-hanger episode. Martin Shaw as DCI George Gently delivers some of the most masterful acting you'll ever see. Even the cinematography (by Ulf Brantas) is superb, note the scene towards the denouement, with Gently contemplating the crisis before entering Durham Cathedral.

1595592,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B009DS3VQA,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[14, 15]","Dramatic HD cinematography. Packed suspense & cop action. 4 [cinema feature length] exciting episodes have different themes. Aristocrat family prejudice, racial conflict, revenge & greed each take a turn. Great adaptations of Alan Hunter crime novels, filmed in HD [great for Blu-ray fans.] All episodes show rural Durham England set in the year 1968. Fun period background music. I love all aspects of this copper series.George Gently (Martin Shaw) is a fine copper, yet grieving widower of 4 years. His assistant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby) displays a bit of a learning curve when it comes to correct police procedure. Together they get the job done, one way or another. This due has thrilled UK crime show fans since 2007 and a 2013 series is in production. Each season seems to get even better.My favorite episode of all time is 2-Gently with Class, due to the music (see why below).SDH SUBTITLES for this 2012 5th series of 4 episodes, each near 1  hours.1...Gently Northern Soul--Black teen's death sends Gently and Bacchus seeking her murderer among a community rife with prejudice & anti-immigrant feelings. The UK locale is not unlike America in the racial restless `60s. The victim's dad played by Eamonn Walker (OZ).2...Gently with Class--Young singer Ellen (Ebony Buckle) drowns in river accident, sending Gently & Bacchus to the aristocratic Blackstone family. Bacchus is prejudice in his investigation techniques. 1969 Chappaquiddick inspired? Ellen's pa played by Christopher Fairbank (Scarlet Pimpernel). The real star is the singing/fiddle playing of Ebony Buckle. A golden missed opportunity to add a bonus of her `Silver Dagger' and `Matty Groves' songs. Click the names to link to MP3s. She does fantastic pub performances and as the dialogue says ""She made the angels weep.""3...The Lost Child--Adopted baby is crib-napped from Stephen (Mark Gatiss- ""Sherlock"") and Frances Groves (Helen Baxendale- ""Friends""). Was it the birth mom, an act connected to past secrets, or crime by chance? A psychological probe.4...Gently in the Cathedral--Bailed criminal Rattigan (Ralph Brown- ""Life on Mars"") is set on revenge. Will young Bacchus support or deny claims that Gently is a murderer? Diana Quick (Brideshead Revisited) is a lawyer, Kevin Whately (Inspector Lewis) a retired copper, and Nigel Lindsay (Clatterford) is a Serious Crimes cop credited playing DCS Trevor Statham, but in the episode he introduces himself to Bacchus as DI Reese Statham. A tiny error lost among all of the action of this episode, even a desperate fight inside beautiful Durham Cathedral. The final scene leaves suspense hanging till the season 6 broadcasts.George Gently series began well in 2007 and has raised the bar ever since. Competes in quality to Midsomer Murder, especially with the two-generational leading characters. Of course there is crime violence and blood, it is murder investigations, but suitable for older teens through adults.Also check outGeorge Gently Collection: Series 1-4offered in a new DVD box set, or Blu-ray.",5,Excellent mystery depth in this UK period crime drama,1365811200,"04 13, 2013",2013,3031,"['Dramatic', 'HD', 'cinematography', 'Packed', 'suspense', 'cop', 'action', '4', '[', 'cinema', 'feature', 'length', ']', 'exciting', 'episodes', 'have', 'different', 'themes', 'Aristocrat', 'family', 'prejudice', 'racial', 'conflict', 'revenge', 'greed', 'take', 'turn', 'Great', 'adaptations', 'Alan', 'Hunter', 'crime', 'novels', 'filmed', 'HD', '[', 'great', 'Blu-ray', 'fans', ']', 'episodes', 'show', 'rural', 'Durham', 'England', 'set', 'year', '1968', 'Fun', 'period', 'background', 'music', 'love', 'aspects', 'copper', 'series.George', 'Gently', 'Martin', 'Shaw', 'fine', 'copper', 'yet', 'grieving', 'widower', '4', 'years', 'assistant', 'John', 'Bacchus', 'Lee', 'Ingleby', 'bit', 'learning', 'curve', 'when', 'correct', 'police', 'procedure', 'Together', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'one', 'way', 'due', 'thrilled', 'UK', 'crime', 'show', 'fans', '2007', '2013', 'series', 'production', 'season', 'get', 'even', 'better.My', 'favorite', 'episode', 'time', '2-Gently', 'Class', 'due', 'music', 'see', 'why', '.SDH', 'SUBTITLES', '2012', '5th', 'series', '4', 'episodes', '1', 'hours.1', 'Gently', 'Northern', 'Soul', 'Black', 'teen', 'death', 'Gently', 'Bacchus', 'seeking', 'murderer', 'community', 'rife', 'prejudice', 'anti-immigrant', 'feelings', 'UK', 'locale', 'not', 'America', 'racial', 'restless', '60s', 'victim', 'dad', 'played', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'OZ', '.2', 'Gently', 'Class', 'Young', 'singer', 'Ellen', 'Ebony', 'Buckle', 'river', 'accident', 'sending', 'Gently', 'Bacchus', 'aristocratic', 'Blackstone', 'family', 'Bacchus', 'prejudice', 'investigation', 'techniques', '1969', 'Chappaquiddick', 'inspired', 'Ellen', 'pa', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Fairbank', 'Scarlet', 'Pimpernel', 'real', 'star', 'singing/fiddle', 'playing', 'Ebony', 'Buckle', 'A', 'golden', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'add', 'bonus', 'Silver', 'Dagger', 'Matty', 'Groves', 'songs', 'Click', 'names', 'link', 'MP3s', 'fantastic', 'pub', 'performances', 'dialogue', 'made', 'angels', 'weep', '3', 'Lost', 'Child', 'Adopted', 'baby', 'crib-napped', 'Stephen', 'Mark', 'Gatiss-', 'Sherlock', 'Frances', 'Groves', 'Helen', 'Baxendale-', 'Friends', 'Was', 'birth', 'mom', 'act', 'connected', 'past', 'secrets', 'crime', 'chance', 'psychological', 'probe.4', 'Gently', 'Cathedral', 'Bailed', 'criminal', 'Rattigan', 'Ralph', 'Brown-', 'Life', 'Mars', 'set', 'revenge', 'Will', 'young', 'Bacchus', 'support', 'deny', 'claims', 'Gently', 'murderer', 'Diana', 'Quick', 'Brideshead', 'Revisited', 'lawyer', 'Kevin', 'Whately', 'Inspector', 'Lewis', 'retired', 'copper', 'Nigel', 'Lindsay', 'Clatterford', 'Serious', 'Crimes', 'cop', 'credited', 'playing', 'DCS', 'Trevor', 'Statham', 'episode', 'Bacchus', 'DI', 'Reese', 'Statham', 'A', 'tiny', 'error', 'lost', 'action', 'episode', 'even', 'desperate', 'fight', 'inside', 'beautiful', 'Durham', 'Cathedral', 'final', 'scene', 'suspense', 'hanging', 'till', 'season', '6', 'broadcasts.George', 'Gently', 'series', 'began', 'well', '2007', 'raised', 'bar', 'ever', 'Competes', 'quality', 'Midsomer', 'Murder', 'especially', 'two-generational', 'leading', 'characters', 'course', 'crime', 'violence', 'blood', 'murder', 'investigations', 'suitable', 'older', 'teens', 'adults.Also', 'check', 'outGeorge', 'Gently', 'Collection', 'Series', '1-4offered', 'new', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'Blu-ray']","George Gently, Series Five"

1595601,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B009DS3VQA,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","It is cause for rejoicing when another set of GEORGE GENTLY is released in North America by Acorn Media. And when the set contains four&#8211;count &#8216;em, four&#8211;feature length mysteries, the anticipation is heightened even further.This is one of those shows that is so good, everything comes to a stop so you can watch it.The four feature-length episodes that comprise Series 5 are:Gently Northern SoulGently With ClassThe Lost ChildGently In The CathedralOne of the strengths of this superior series is the way relevant social issues of the 1960s are woven into the plots. Gently Northern Soul is a perfect example of this. Watching the always-wonderful Lee Ingleby go from having a typical (for the time) racist attitude towards black people to becoming more open-minded is another staple of this series. In other words, the characters grow. Bacchus (Ingleby) is initially skeptical about going undercover to investigate the murder of a young black woman. His attitude is subtly mocked when he is caught by Gently and a colleague practicing his dancing before setting out on his task (in an after hours club where many people of colour mix with whites). Ingleby looks ridiculous bopping about, a sort of penance for his limited view of people, initially. Like all the episodes, Gently Northern Soul is beautifully plotted and comfortably fills its 90 minute running time, leaving the viewer wanting more.More &#8217;60s angst is explored in the second episode, Gently With Class, in which Gently and Bacchus investigate the tragic death of a beatiful and talented young lady from the lower class who has an uncomfortable relationship with an upper class family. The sparks really fly between Gently and Bacchus in this one and their respective positions on class prove central to the story. The class system is difficult for some North Americans to understand. It&#8217;s basically the &#8220;haves and have nots&#8221; and it was in the 1960s that the unfairness of it all really came to a head in a significant way. This is another example of why GEORGE GENTLY is so outstanding: it really has its finger on the pulse of the times it is portraying.Episode three is given a boost by the always wonderful Helen Baxendale playing the mother of an abducted baby. The plot twists in this episode are truly surprising and the outcome bittersweet. In each of these episodes Bacchus develops more and more into a character of real complexity. Gently remains rock solid (though never boring&#8211;Martin Shaw is too good for that to happen) and the relationship between the two leads continues to be the backbone of the series.Nothing gone before will prepare you for the whirlwind fourth episode which has a cliffhanger so tantalizing it will have you shouting at your TV/computer screen, demanding the immediate release of Series 6.

We're now in the late 1960s, and Gently and his younger Sergeant Bacchus tackle cases involving everything from racism to aristocratic decline. The two leads and their supporting cast give magnificent performances, and as I watch the episodes, it's hard not to believe they were actually filmed during the period in question, the design and attention to detail are so good.

Superb enough to live on for another year.  This series kicks off with a racial incident, capturing some of the tensions of the 1960's.  Another episode highlights the tension between the classes.  Detective Sergeant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby) plays the perfect ridiculous foil to the wise, patient and yes, gentle, Detective Inspector George Gently (Martin Shaw).  John manages to be effective in spite of his antics, and George is his anchor and gives him a long leash.  Too long, some of us would say.  It's amazing John hasn't been fired, but he provides so much entertainment, George would probably hate to lose him.This series has four episodes, and so does upcoming Series Six.

His DS, Jonathan Bacchus, played by Lee Ingleby, is immature, prejudiced and thinks he knows it all. Just when you want to shake him, he changes his behavior and starts to make sense. It must be that his mentor, George Gently, played by the inimitable Matin Shaw, has finally knocked some sense into him!In the fifth series, we find them in the late 1960's, and  racism and changes that the 60's brought to the US, are seen in spades in the UK. In this fifth season, we have four episodes all about 75 minutes a piece. I have seen the first two episodes, and they are terrific.Episode 1A young black woman is found murdered. Northumberland is full of racism, and Gently is hopeful that new immigration laws will be passed. This is one area where Jonathan Bacchus shows he can have mature behavior.Episode 2A  beautiful young woman is found dead in the passenger seat of a car, apparently she died while struggling to get free. The detectives follow the trail to the home of local aristocrats. DS Bacchus has arrested the younger son several times and shows a great deal of resentment about the wealthy. Another episode where DS Bacchus thinks he knows it all.I love the writing and top notch acting, and Martin Shaw can do no wrong.
