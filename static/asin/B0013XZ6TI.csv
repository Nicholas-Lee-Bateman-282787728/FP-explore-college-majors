Diana's in her element keeping Tom on track, Jane on her toes, the other residents stirred up, Tom's family in an uproar, and making life a never ending misery for "" the idiot Bains"". I wish this series had lasted longer than it did. It shows that just because you are growing older you don't have to lay down and die. The passions we had when we were younger can still be maintained. My father called my missions "" getting up on my soapbox""; but hay someone has to do it.

Waiting for God is delightfully humorous while exploring the lives of ""the elderly inmates"" as Diana puts it, as well as the lives of their relatives and care givers. I have always enjoyed how this series strips away the mask of old age and makes you see the essential human lives that are still thriving for these individuals. I love the story arc, at the end of this series there is no disappointment, you are left with happy contentment at the final events for these friends you come to love - even the Idiot Baines.

1144521,A2EIKI4ZYV8VU7,B0013XZ6TI,"D. K. Hingle ""justkes""","[9, 10]","Ah, Tom & Diana of Bayview are BACK!  The third series (season) holds some interesting twists - the pair continue to flummox Harvey Baines, while Jane continues to covet Harvey.  Diana takes on politics, an estate agent scam, helps deliver her great-niece Diana ('not another one,' moans Harvey), sees that Jane gets 'engaged' to Harvey, and still finds time to land in Tom's bed.  The Christmas special is a worthy addition to the collection, and I'm pleased to see it included.  Another review lists the episodes, so I won't duplicate that here.  The series does address - in its own inimitable way - some of the serious issues of aging.  The estate agent scam is only one of them.I wanted to make note of the infamous ""bedroom"" episode: no US writing team could have done this as well.  From the hilarious wake (a resident left 200 quid so those remaining could get 'legless' in his memory) through the very last scene, all is IMPLIED.  It is so tastefully done, with witty dialogue but actually showing nothing, that the show makes its points without resorting to the vulgarity so prevalent in US sitcoms today.Stephanie Cole (awarded an O.B.E. in 2005, and who was aged when she took the part) and Graham Crowden (who is still actively performing at age 86) are, as always, stellar as the geriatric dynamic duo.  Daniel Hill as Harvey along with Janine Duvitski as Jane provide the support for the lead pair. The late Andrew Tourelle as Geoffrey and Sandra Payne as Marion add to the fun.Since this series has a beginning (series/season one), follows a somewhat overall story arc, and has a definite end, please don't make this your first visit to Bayview.  Although each episode - for the most part - stands alone, the best way to visit the 'retirement community for the almost dead' is to see the shows in order.If you have already visited the place, then WELCOME BACK!  Now we all sit and wait for series four and five - and hopefully we'll get the second Christmas special as well.

1144522,AE0337VVP8MRM,B0013XZ6TI,E. Borgman,"[1, 1]","I was rather disappointed at seeing how the show managed to drop in quality between Season One and Season Three. In fact, never have I seen a show fall so quickly in standards since Wiseguy! Judging by the other reviews here people aren't judging the shows seriously or apparently by seasons because the Third Season does not compare to the First which was right up there with some of the best shows from Britain.This seasons was hackneyed, the characters are just old and tired. Whereas previously Diane was funny, she is now just too far in the: I can't stand that woman! isle. She's vulgar, angry, spiteful and just plain unfunny at this point. Diane has no redeeming qualities.The show started taking a more sexual bent in Season Two and it is even more nauseating in this season. Couldn't come up with anything more original than typical sex jokes, could we?The characters have changed too broadly since the first shows. In the very first episode Tom's grandchildren were normal kids. His grandson was sorry to see him move out of their home. In these shows we're introduced to two monsters that are now Tom's grandchildren. They are not the same characters we were first introduced to. Neither is Diane. In fact, the show became too broad and ridiculous in it's humor at this point and definitely more crude.The underlying messages of the ""humor"" has become typical and sour to me. These show are far more political, with the usual lack luster, myopic, Leftist politics one gets from Hollywood or British TV writers. We have to get ear fulls on merits of euthanasia and swipes at businesses that make money. Anything more boring than these stale chestnuts? Then, of course, a fatal does of anti-Christianity that is just brimming over the top. Jane, who is a practicing Christian, is made to be the most obsequious buffoon one hass ever seen! She had been a funny character, but now she's just a target for Diane and Harvey and all the humor that had been there is lost.Throughout the series up through season three you can see influences of where they pilfered from the best, such asFawlty Towers: The Complete Collectionand the first season it was close to Diane being a female Fawlty, but unlike Fawlty Towers, the makers couldn't keep up with the quality of the first ones and this season really falls flat.

But Tom and Diana decide it would be fun to pretend to be Harvey's parents.  After they run off Lucy, Harvey has Jane pretend to be his fiancee when Mother arrives.The Estate Agent - Harvey gets entangled with a beautiful estate agent, who turns out to be even more unscrupulous than Harvey. It takes the dynamic geriatric duo to uncover her evil plot.Scandal - Following a wild wake, Diana wakes up in Tom's bed.Sabotage - When Harvey ""borrows"" the money from the vacation fund for his new pet project, it is up to Tom and Diana to correct this.Politics - Diana is bored, so she puts herself up for counsel.
