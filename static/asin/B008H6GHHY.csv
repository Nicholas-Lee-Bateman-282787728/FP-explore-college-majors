Kids will probably like them.The 4-pack is still a good value since it cost about the same as a single of Angles in the Outfield (the one we really wanted.)If you like Angles in the Outfield I would recommend it. You might like the others too.,4,Angles in the Outfield is Still Good.,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,352,"['other', 'three', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'are', 'very', '34', 'mediocre', '34', 'best', 'Kids', 'will', 'probably', 'them.The', '4-pack', 'still', 'good', 'value', 'same', 'single', 'Angles', 'Outfield', 'one', 'really', 'wanted', 'like', 'Angles', 'Outfield', 'would', 'recommend', 'might', 'like', 'others', 'too']",Disney Game Changers 4-Movie Collection (Angels in the Outfield / Angels in the Infield / Angels in the Endzone / Perfect Game)

1553314,A26EXMDN188M0,B008H6GHHY,Lysan,"[3, 4]","This is another great selection of Disney Family Movies that can be enjoyed again and again. I bought this one mainly for ""Angels in the Outfield"" as I remembered it as a heartwarming story of 2 young foster boys who never gave up believing in miracles, and a temperamental coach of a losing baseball team, played by Danny Glover. The team are the ""Angels"", a bumbling lot who are in desperate need of a win and, in answer to the oldest boy's prayer, are actually rescued by a group of angels from above. The head angel, ""Al"", is Christopher Lloyd, who plays the part perfectly. I especially enjoyed the graphics of the heavenly ""Angels"" and also, the musical score of the movie. The climax of it almost brought tears to my eyes, just as it did many years ago. Ok, so I'm a sentimental soul who rather watches some clean family entertainment than all the bloody and gorey violence presented in most of todays movies.One thing I don't understand: the 4 movies are listed on Amazon as ""1 disc"" yet I received  a set of 4, beautifully packaged and labeled. I expected a 2-sided disc with 2 movies on each side so this was a pleasant surprise. I'm in the process of checking out some more of the Game-Changers Movies from Disney because the prices are more than reasonable.BTW - I also watched ""Angels in the Endzone"", another good story, with Christopher Lloyd again as ""Al"". Next up: ""Angels in the Infield"" and ""The Perfect Game"". I have a feeling these won't disappoint neither!",5,Wonderful!,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,1478,"['great', 'selection', 'Disney', 'Family', 'Movies', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'again', 'again', 'bought', 'one', 'mainly', 'Angels', 'Outfield', 'remembered', 'heartwarming', 'story', '2', 'young', 'foster', 'boys', 'who', 'never', 'gave', 'up', 'believing', 'miracles', 'temperamental', 'coach', 'losing', 'baseball', 'team', 'played', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'team', 'are', 'Angels', 'bumbling', 'lot', 'who', 'are', 'desperate', 'need', 'win', 'answer', 'oldest', 'boy', 'prayer', 'are', 'actually', 'rescued', 'group', 'angels', 'head', 'angel', 'Al', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'part', 'perfectly', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'graphics', 'heavenly', 'Angels', 'also', 'musical', 'score', 'movie', 'climax', 'almost', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'just', 'did', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Ok', ""'m"", 'sentimental', 'soul', 'who', 'rather', 'clean', 'family', 'entertainment', 'bloody', 'gorey', 'violence', 'presented', 'most', 'todays', 'movies.One', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', '4', 'movies', 'are', 'listed', 'Amazon', '1', 'disc', 'yet', 'received', 'set', '4', 'beautifully', 'packaged', 'labeled', 'expected', '2-sided', 'disc', '2', 'movies', 'side', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', ""'m"", 'process', 'checking', 'out', 'more', 'Game-Changers', 'Movies', 'Disney', 'prices', 'are', 'more', 'reasonable.BTW', 'also', 'watched', 'Angels', 'Endzone', 'good', 'story', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'again', 'Al', 'up', 'Angels', 'Infield', 'Perfect', 'Game', 'have', 'feeling', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'neither']",Disney Game Changers 4-Movie Collection (Angels in the Outfield / Angels in the Infield / Angels in the Endzone / Perfect Game)
