It's incomprehensible to me why a studio would do this, unless it's a misguided and callous attempt to economize. There must be millions of movie fans who want subtitles/captions for different reasons, so I'm not sure how the studios think they are economizing by ignoring the wishes of a large segment of the market. I like to watch movies at low volume with the English subtitles turned on so I don't have to strain to catch all the dialog, while my wife is a non-native English speaker who needs subtitles. Certainly there are many cinephiles with less than perfect hearing. So it would seem to be counterproductive for studios to release DVDs like this one.",1,no English subtitles/closed captions!,1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,742,"['5/4/12', 'One', 'star', 'DVD', 'lack', 'subtitles/closed', 'captions', 'incomprehensible', 'why', 'studio', 'would', 'do', 'misguided', 'callous', 'attempt', 'economize', 'must', 'be', 'millions', 'movie', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'subtitles/captions', 'different', 'reasons', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'studios', 'think', 'are', 'economizing', 'ignoring', 'wishes', 'large', 'segment', 'market', 'like', 'watch', 'movies', 'low', 'volume', 'English', 'subtitles', 'turned', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'strain', 'catch', 'dialog', 'wife', 'non-native', 'English', 'speaker', 'who', 'subtitles', 'Certainly', 'are', 'many', 'cinephiles', 'less', 'perfect', 'hearing', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'counterproductive', 'studios', 'release', 'DVDs', 'one']",Anton Chekhov's The Duel

1420311,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B004MV47WK,Russell Fanelli,"[10, 12]","Sadly for me, The Duel is a film which looks good on the screen, but unfortunately is a badly directed adaptation of Anton Chekov's fine novella of the same name.  The director, Dover Koshashvili, portrays Laevsky, the central character in the novella, as a nasty, brutish lout whose bizarre behavior is as unaccountable to the other characters in the film as it is to the viewer. He has left St. Petersburg for a small town on the Black Sea with another man's wife.  He discovers that he does not love this woman, Nadya, and wants to leave her and return to St. Petersburg.  He tries to borrow money from a local doctor, who in turn asks a zoologist, Van Koren, for the rubles.  Van Koren hates Laevsky and tries to persuade the doctor to convince Laevsky to take Nadya with him when he leaves.  When Laevsky comes to ask for the money, he insults the doctor and Van Koren uses this provocation to challenge Laevsky to fight a duel.  Those that wish to see this film can discover the outcome of the duel for themselves.As noted, director Koshashvili's mishandling and misunderstanding of the main character make it difficult for the viewer to make much sense of the story.  All the other characters in the film have the same problem as the viewer; they watch Laevsky's antics with some astonishment, not knowing what to make of his behavior, and yet they tolerate him.  Almost as confusing and equally unsatisfying is the treatment of Nadya, the woman who has left her husband for Laevsky.  The director has little understanding of what motivates her as she interacts with Laevsky and the other characters in the film. In Chekov's novella, Nadya plays a small, but important role.  In Koshasvili's film she is a central character and has many scenes unnecessary to the development of the story.After viewing the movie I went back to Chekov's novella to determine if there was some confusion in his telling of his story and his treatment of his characters.  The story, translated by the reliable Constance Garnett, is crystal clear and beautifully told.  Laevsky and Nadya are complicated human beings.  Chekov is so skillful and great a writer that we slowly begin to understand these truly unhappy and pitiful people.  I recommend the novella, not the film.",2,Badly directed adaptation of Chekov's novella,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",2012,2259,"['Sadly', 'Duel', 'film', 'good', 'screen', 'unfortunately', 'badly', 'directed', 'adaptation', 'Anton', 'Chekov', 'fine', 'novella', 'same', 'name', 'director', 'Dover', 'Koshashvili', 'Laevsky', 'central', 'character', 'novella', 'nasty', 'brutish', 'lout', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'as', 'unaccountable', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'viewer', 'left', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'small', 'town', 'Black', 'Sea', 'man', 'wife', 'not', 'love', 'woman', 'Nadya', 'leave', 'return', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'borrow', 'money', 'local', 'doctor', 'who', 'turn', 'zoologist', 'Van', 'Koren', 'rubles', 'Van', 'Koren', 'Laevsky', 'tries', 'persuade', 'doctor', 'convince', 'Laevsky', 'take', 'Nadya', 'when', 'When', 'Laevsky', 'ask', 'money', 'doctor', 'Van', 'Koren', 'provocation', 'challenge', 'Laevsky', 'fight', 'duel', 'wish', 'see', 'film', 'can', 'discover', 'outcome', 'duel', 'themselves.As', 'noted', 'director', 'Koshashvili', 'mishandling', 'misunderstanding', 'main', 'character', 'make', 'difficult', 'viewer', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'story', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'have', 'same', 'problem', 'viewer', 'watch', 'Laevsky', 'antics', 'astonishment', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'make', 'behavior', 'yet', 'tolerate', 'confusing', 'equally', 'unsatisfying', 'treatment', 'Nadya', 'woman', 'who', 'left', 'husband', 'Laevsky', 'director', 'little', 'understanding', 'what', 'Laevsky', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'Chekov', 'novella', 'Nadya', 'small', 'important', 'role', 'Koshasvili', 'film', 'central', 'character', 'many', 'scenes', 'unnecessary', 'development', 'story.After', 'viewing', 'movie', 'went', 'back', 'Chekov', 'novella', 'determine', 'was', 'confusion', 'telling', 'story', 'treatment', 'characters', 'story', 'translated', 'reliable', 'Constance', 'Garnett', 'crystal', 'clear', 'beautifully', 'told', 'Laevsky', 'Nadya', 'are', 'complicated', 'human', 'beings', 'Chekov', 'so', 'skillful', 'great', 'writer', 'slowly', 'begin', 'understand', 'truly', 'unhappy', 'pitiful', 'people', 'recommend', 'novella', 'not', 'film']",Anton Chekhov's The Duel

(It's so beyond Scott's other roles and he shows himself as a versatile, quality actor in this one. I'm not familiar with Chekhov at all but doesn't matter here.  None of the story is obscure as you'd expect from a classic writer. The story was done more like a stage play but most frequently outdoors. More like a series of vignettes with the same characters. The cast did a good job to go with Scott's exceptional acting. The scenery in The Duel was worth watching if just for the sea scenes. I wanted so much to NE there. The costumes were not overwhelmingly period. I am SO glad they used their own British accents instead of trying to do Russian accents. It's worth watching more than once.
