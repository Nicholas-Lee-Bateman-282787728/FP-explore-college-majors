Dukakis really over played her &#34;butch&#34; role and the other actress added little to the movie.  My biggest gripe, instead of taking advantage of having the funding of such a film (which is rare), and taking the time to create a meaningful and educational film about two people of the same gender, in love, wanting the same things as other couples in love, while coping with the dynamics of that love not being socially acceptable and the repercussions of aging on top of that...well, it could have been powerful.  Instead, it was a loss.  The film was a wasted opportunity to make something meaningful.  It lacked emotion, character development, and a deep story line....it made no sense at all, on the verge of trying to be a comedy at times.  Ugh!

Olympia Dukakis plays Stella, a masculine Stella to Brenda Fritch's, Dot. They have been living in rural Maine together for 31 years  All of this time they have never admitted to being Lesbians to the public, only to themselves. They have lived a good life, and seem to be very happy.  The one day Dot fell, her granddaughter decided it was time for her to go to a nursing home. Dot, is blind and signed papers that gave her granddaughter power of attorney. Thus Dot went into a nursing home, leaving Stella fighting mad.Stella took revenge and in the middle of the night kidnapped Dot and off they went to Canada. Along the way they pick up a hitchhiker, a young man. Their adventures should be seen to be believed. Some of the film turns maudlin and goes on too long, but the message is there. There is a lot of humor, blue language from Stella, and life abounds. This role is quite an adventure for Olivia Dukakis, she really turns it on, and is quite believable. The four letter words just roll her tongue.  Brenda Fricker is a joy, quite the opposite, demure and sweet. The young man somehow seems to fit in, though the film could have been fine without him. What he introduces is a strange meeting with his family and some tales of his life as a stripper.All in all, the film was quite good, lots of good humor, not for the faint of heart, and not for anyone who has preconceived notions.Recommended. prisrob 02-12-14",4,Life Together,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,1523,"['film', 'love', 'Told', 'round', 'manner', 'what', 'down', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'Stella', 'masculine', 'Stella', 'Brenda', 'Fritch', 'Dot', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'rural', 'Maine', 'together', '31', 'years', 'time', 'have', 'never', 'admitted', 'being', 'Lesbians', 'public', 'only', 'have', 'lived', 'good', 'life', 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'happy', 'one', 'day', 'Dot', 'fell', 'granddaughter', 'decided', 'was', 'time', 'go', 'nursing', 'home', 'Dot', 'blind', 'signed', 'papers', 'gave', 'granddaughter', 'power', 'attorney', 'Thus', 'Dot', 'went', 'nursing', 'home', 'leaving', 'Stella', 'fighting', 'mad.Stella', 'took', 'revenge', 'middle', 'night', 'kidnapped', 'Dot', 'went', 'Canada', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'hitchhiker', 'young', 'man', 'adventures', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'film', 'maudlin', 'too', 'long', 'message', 'there', 'lot', 'humor', 'blue', 'language', 'Stella', 'life', 'abounds', 'role', 'quite', 'adventure', 'Olivia', 'Dukakis', 'really', 'quite', 'believable', 'four', 'letter', 'words', 'just', 'roll', 'tongue', 'Brenda', 'Fricker', 'joy', 'quite', 'opposite', 'demure', 'sweet', 'young', 'man', 'somehow', 'fit', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'What', 'strange', 'meeting', 'family', 'tales', 'life', 'stripper.All', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'lots', 'good', 'humor', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'not', 'anyone', 'who', 'preconceived', 'notions.Recommended', 'prisrob', '02-12-14']",Cloudburst

This is true life and it is happening somewhere to someone everyday.  Olympia Dukakis and Brenda Fricker should be applauded for bringing this story to life and making it real.
