I have to admit it's painful to watch the old 60s version with Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda--and Van Johnson doing his usual ""best friend of the hero"" roll.  It's too full of cliches, and at this distance almost too patronizing to bear.  Unfortunately the remake is almost as painful.  I'm not certain for whom the film is intended.  Those of us who grew up with the 60s version probably aren't going to find the nostolgia they're looking for, and those who didn't aren't necessarily going to find the antics of the film very satisfying.  Most of them have grown up with video games and TV.  Most of what can be done has been done ad infinitum, and the kids have already seen it.  Everything is there from cute pets and precocious children for the oldsters, to hunky teenage sons and gorgeous teenage daughters for the younger folks.  Everyone ends up best friends by the end.  How surprising.  At least they didn't commit the sin of adding a ""new addition"" to the family to make everything ""all better.""

967660,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000E3LI4U,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","First of all, Yours, Mine and Ours is a *lot* better than Cheaper By the Dozen.  At least in this film, they knew how to give each child a reasonable amount of filming attention.  Granted, we're talking about *18 kids* living in the same house together (more like a castle, when you think about it).  It's pretty hard to give 18 children the amount of attention they need for the viewer to gain an appreciation for their character.  That's probably the only flaw with the movie.  In two hours, it's hard to care about everyone.Besides that, the film, while starting off rather slow and predictable, eventually manages to gain my interest by having the children of the two separate families come together and NOT get along with each other at all.  This means, when the children start fighting, they absolutely DESTROY the house in the process.  That's what children do, and that's probably what would happen if 18 of them were living in the same house together.Of course, it would have been better had the parents been made to look like they actually KNOW a thing or two about parenting (which raised some questions in my mind numerous times throughout the movie about what makes these two adults think they have the right to have SO MANY children when apparently it's hard for them to keep just ONE child in line).  At least the father tried to discipline the children a few times.  Still, I believe many times he wasn't harsh enough, which is why the children continued to not listen.I enjoyed the scenes where the children went insane and ripped the house to pieces.  Also, some of the children were remembered by me after the movie was over because they were given an appropriate amount of time to build upon their character and own storylines.  Of course the older kids were more concerned about typical teenage problems such as relationships, and the younger children were remembered for their constant bickering over toys and other things a child would consider important.Overall, a job well done.",4,a pretty good movie,1172620800,"02 28, 2007",2007,2003,"['First', 'Yours', 'Mine', 'Ours', '*lot*', 'better', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'least', 'film', 'knew', 'how', 'give', 'child', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'filming', 'attention', 'Granted', ""'re"", 'talking', '*18', 'kids*', 'living', 'same', 'house', 'together', 'more', 'castle', 'when', 'think', 'pretty', 'hard', 'give', '18', 'children', 'amount', 'attention', 'need', 'viewer', 'gain', 'appreciation', 'character', 'probably', 'only', 'flaw', 'movie', 'two', 'hours', 'hard', 'care', 'everyone.Besides', 'film', 'starting', 'off', 'rather', 'slow', 'predictable', 'eventually', 'gain', 'interest', 'having', 'children', 'two', 'separate', 'families', 'come', 'together', 'NOT', 'get', 'along', 'other', 'when', 'children', 'start', 'fighting', 'absolutely', 'DESTROY', 'house', 'process', 'what', 'children', 'do', 'probably', 'what', 'would', 'happen', '18', 'were', 'living', 'same', 'house', 'together.Of', 'course', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'parents', 'been', 'made', 'look', 'actually', 'KNOW', 'thing', 'two', 'parenting', 'raised', 'questions', 'mind', 'numerous', 'times', 'movie', 'what', 'two', 'adults', 'think', 'have', 'right', 'have', 'SO', 'MANY', 'children', 'when', 'apparently', 'hard', 'keep', 'just', 'ONE', 'child', 'line', 'least', 'father', 'tried', 'discipline', 'children', 'few', 'times', 'Still', 'believe', 'many', 'times', 'was', ""n't"", 'harsh', 'enough', 'why', 'children', 'continued', 'not', 'listen.I', 'enjoyed', 'scenes', 'where', 'children', 'went', 'insane', 'ripped', 'house', 'pieces', 'Also', 'children', 'were', 'remembered', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'were', 'given', 'appropriate', 'amount', 'time', 'build', 'character', 'own', 'storylines', 'course', 'older', 'kids', 'were', 'more', 'concerned', 'typical', 'teenage', 'problems', 'such', 'relationships', 'younger', 'children', 'were', 'remembered', 'constant', 'bickering', 'toys', 'other', 'things', 'child', 'would', 'consider', 'important.Overall', 'job', 'well', 'done']",N/A

Dennis Quaid plays a coast guard admiral/widower with 8 kids.  He is  pure military man, all rules and charts and schedules.  Rene Russo plays a fashion designer/widow with 10 kids, her life is one big happy mess.  Quaid returns home and reunites with Russo, his high school sweetheart.  After a high school renunion, the couples announce to their kids they are now married and going to move in together in one big house.  Or maybe they were just engaged at this point, I'm not sure.  Anyway, the families move in together and the attempts at hilarity ensue.With so many characters, you aren't going to get to know any of them. But there are a lot of cute moments.  Its hard not to laugh when the 18 kids are destroying the house fighting with each other.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[11, 13]","It's not everyday that you can walk up to the DVD rack in your local department store and pick up a flick that everyone in the family can enjoy, but ""Yours, Mine & Ours"" is one such flick.  I wasn't expecting much from this film at first.  I only picked it up because it's PG and looked harmless enough for everyone to watch.  In other words, I skipped out on flicks like ""Underworld:  Evolution"" and ""Wolf Creek"" in order to watch a film with my entire family.I was quite surprised by this family film.  Sure, I've seen funnier flicks with a PG (and even G) rating, but this film rolls along at a frantic pace with pratfalls galore and plenty of ""aw, shucks"" humor.  It has a certain appeal to it that makes you feel as if you've gotten your money's worth.  Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo are funny as the heads of two separate and very different families who become one whenever Quaid and Russo marry unannounced to their children.  Oh, and I've forgotten to mention that Quaid had eight children and Russo has ten (four biologically, six adopted).There's little room for character development.  In fact, I couldn't give you but maybe two or three of the elder children's names.  Quaid's  bunch are regimental, what with a military father at the helm.  Russo's kids are free spirited and artistic, without a care in the world.  The kids hate living with each other, so they devise a plan to breakup their new parents.  Of course, this leads to an obvious bonding of the families that makes for a predictable ending, but it's done with so much silliness that it manages to work.Rip Torn and Linda Hunt have minor roles in the film, though I must say that Hunt's nanny role is hilarious at times.  The rest of the cast does a solid job.  Youngsters and hip parents such as myself will recognize Drake Bell and the girl who plays his little sis, Megan, on ""Drake and Josh.""  Even hipper parents will pick out Danielle Panabaker, who's made a name for herself on the Disney Channel and in another recent wonderful family comedy, ""Sky High.""Predictable, silly, and sometimes too sugary sweet, I still feel that ""Yours, Mine & Ours"" deserves a modest four stars.

967689,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000E3LI4U,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 2]","This remake of ""Yours, Mine & Ours"" is only ninety minutes long, which is not a lot of screen time if you are talking about the twenty central characters that big one big unhappy family when widower Frank Beardsley with his eight children marries Helen North and her ten children (six of who are adopted).  You would think it would take a while for these two people, played by Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo, to be crazy enough to decide to get married and set up a household with twenty people in it (twenty one when you throw in Linda Hunt as the housekeeper), but no.  This 2005 family comedy takes a short cut on the romantic comedy part of the proceedings because this time around Frank and Helen not only know each other, they were King and Queen of the Prom in high school.  Besides, the film cuts his proposal and skips the kids meeting each other for the first time (the two deleted scenes with the DVD), to get right to the madness once everybody moves into a lighthouse (the only place big enough to house them all).There actually was a book by Helen Beardsley that was made into a movie in 1968 starring the unlikely team of Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball (and young Tim Matheson and Morgan Brittany as some of the brood).  I still remember the scene where they go to the base commissary to buy food and spend A HUNDRED DOLLARS on food to feed the giant family.  The script by Ron Burch & David Kidd, who previously did ""Head Over Heels"" together, keeps the names of the couple, the number of kids, and that he is a military officer (Coast Guard instead of Navy this time around).  What was a rather sweet story about twenty people learning to live with each other is transformed into an excuse for slapstick with Quaid the primary target.  The two sets of kids hate each other enough that they decide to band together to destroy their parent's marriage.  After all, each knows exactly what buttons to push for Mom and Dad.  Of course, in banding together they are creating the very family they are trying to rip apart, an irony that is almost but not quite lost on them.I really did not like the romantic comedy aspect of this being relegated to such a minor role.  Frank is anal retentive when it comes to organization and Helen is into group hugs and against spanking, and what I really liked about her was that she tends to burst into laughter at the absurdity of what is happening.  But like the script we just have to go with the flow and assume Frank and Helen love each other even if they have no time to prove it beyond the proposal scene that got deleted.  This is a film where the set up regarding the light in the lighthouse is going to have a payoff even if it means taking place during the middle of the day and even if it requires 18 kids standing there and not saying anything when the problems they have created could be solved by the right word at the right time instead of a set of grand gestures.Sean Faris and Danielle Panabaker are probably the most familiar faces among the young actors and actresses, unless you watch a lot more movies with cute kids than I do.  Besides it is not like you will be able to remember which kid is which.  Untill the paint battles begin you can at least tell the Beardsley kids from the North kids just because of how they dress.  I suppose kids will like the slapstick and we can assume the 90 minute length will not challenge their attention span, which means they will probably like this movie more than adults.  However, as this movie indicates and as we have often found to be the case in the real world, sometimes kids just do not know any better.  Fonda and Ball were at the heart of the earlier version (and a clip of him giving the life lesson of the 1968 film is included in the special features), while here Quaid and Russo are put through a rather joyless wringer to try and tug on heartstrings that went slack twenty minutes into the film.",3,This remake forgoes the romantic comedy to go right for the slapstick,1141257600,"03 2, 2006",2006,3913,"['remake', 'Yours', 'Mine', 'Ours', 'only', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'long', 'not', 'lot', 'screen', 'time', 'are', 'talking', 'twenty', 'central', 'characters', 'big', 'one', 'big', 'unhappy', 'family', 'when', 'widower', 'Frank', 'Beardsley', 'eight', 'children', 'Helen', 'North', 'ten', 'children', 'six', 'who', 'are', 'adopted', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'take', 'while', 'two', 'people', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'be', 'crazy', 'enough', 'decide', 'get', 'married', 'set', 'up', 'household', 'twenty', 'people', 'twenty', 'one', 'when', 'throw', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'housekeeper', '2005', 'family', 'comedy', 'short', 'cut', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'part', 'proceedings', 'time', 'Frank', 'Helen', 'not', 'only', 'know', 'other', 'were', 'King', 'Queen', 'Prom', 'high', 'school', 'Besides', 'film', 'proposal', 'kids', 'meeting', 'other', 'first', 'time', 'two', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'get', 'right', 'madness', 'everybody', 'lighthouse', 'only', 'place', 'big', 'enough', 'house', 'actually', 'was', 'book', 'Helen', 'Beardsley', 'was', 'made', 'movie', '1968', 'starring', 'unlikely', 'team', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'young', 'Tim', 'Matheson', 'Morgan', 'Brittany', 'brood', 'still', 'remember', 'scene', 'where', 'go', 'base', 'commissary', 'buy', 'food', 'spend', 'A', 'HUNDRED', 'DOLLARS', 'food', 'feed', 'giant', 'family', 'script', 'Ron', 'Burch', 'David', 'Kidd', 'who', 'previously', 'did', 'Head', 'Heels', 'together', 'names', 'couple', 'number', 'kids', 'military', 'officer', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'instead', 'Navy', 'time', 'around', 'What', 'was', 'rather', 'sweet', 'story', 'twenty', 'people', 'learning', 'live', 'other', 'transformed', 'excuse', 'slapstick', 'Quaid', 'primary', 'target', 'two', 'sets', 'kids', 'hate', 'other', 'enough', 'decide', 'band', 'together', 'destroy', 'parent', 'marriage', 'exactly', 'what', 'buttons', 'push', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'course', 'banding', 'together', 'are', 'creating', 'very', 'family', 'are', 'trying', 'rip', 'apart', 'irony', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'lost', 'them.I', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'aspect', 'being', 'relegated', 'minor', 'role', 'Frank', 'anal', 'retentive', 'when', 'organization', 'Helen', 'group', 'hugs', 'spanking', 'what', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'burst', 'laughter', 'absurdity', 'what', 'happening', 'script', 'just', 'have', 'go', 'flow', 'assume', 'Frank', 'Helen', 'love', 'other', 'even', 'have', 'time', 'prove', 'proposal', 'scene', 'got', 'deleted', 'film', 'where', 'set', 'up', 'regarding', 'light', 'lighthouse', 'going', 'have', 'payoff', 'even', 'taking', 'place', 'middle', 'day', 'even', '18', 'kids', 'standing', 'there', 'not', 'saying', 'anything', 'when', 'problems', 'have', 'created', 'could', 'be', 'solved', 'right', 'word', 'right', 'time', 'instead', 'set', 'grand', 'gestures.Sean', 'Faris', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'are', 'probably', 'most', 'familiar', 'young', 'actors', 'actresses', 'watch', 'lot', 'more', 'movies', 'cute', 'kids', 'do', 'not', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'remember', 'kid', 'paint', 'can', 'least', 'tell', 'Beardsley', 'kids', 'North', 'kids', 'just', 'how', 'dress', 'suppose', 'kids', 'will', 'like', 'slapstick', 'can', 'assume', '90', 'minute', 'length', 'will', 'not', 'challenge', 'attention', 'span', 'will', 'probably', 'movie', 'more', 'adults', 'However', 'movie', 'have', 'often', 'found', 'be', 'case', 'real', 'world', 'sometimes', 'kids', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'better', 'Fonda', 'Ball', 'were', 'heart', 'earlier', 'version', 'clip', 'giving', 'life', 'lesson', '1968', 'film', 'included', 'special', 'features', 'here', 'Quaid', 'Russo', 'are', 'put', 'rather', 'joyless', 'wringer', 'try', 'tug', 'heartstrings', 'went', 'slack', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film']",N/A

967692,A36EW68H08UOCS,B000E3LI4U,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[56, 62]","Yesterday was our middle child's 18th birthday.  As part of the festivities there was a trip to the local cinema.  The birthday girl gets to choose the movie, you know, so ""Pride and Prejudice"" (my choice) wasn't chosen.  Mom vetoed Brokeback Mountain.  The compromise choice was ""Yours, Mine and Ours"".Just before going out the door I checked a couple of on-line reviews.  Yikes!  Other reviewers were trashing this film.  On top of that I'm not a big fan of the ""madcap comedy featuring a housefull of characters."" I gritted my teeth and vowed to not complain or cast any shadow over the sweet 18 celebration.Okay - this is not Casablanca.  But I liked it.  This movie overcame my negative expectations and won me over despite it's numerous flaws.  Why?  The characters, though drawn with broad strokes, are nonetheless likable, and I found myself rooting for them going into the final act.Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo are as attractive as actors my age get, and their characters are both essentially good.  That was a good place to start.Quaid is a 2-Star Coast Guard Admiral just assigned to take over leadership at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut.  A widower of several years, he presides over his brood of 8 kids along with housekeeper Linda Hunt.  Russo portrays his high school sweetheart, still living there in New London.  She is also widowed.  After 4 children of their own, she and her previous spouse adopted 6 more.  There is a real international feeling in that house.  She works at home in a messily creative studio as a designer who sells things at places like Saks Fifth Avenue.The admiral's kids are all quite regimented.  They keep a tidy ship, adhere rigidly to written schedules and call their father ""Admiral"", which I thought sort of odd despite 22 years in the Navy myself.  My children call me ""Dad"". But I digress.  Russo is raising her children to be free-thinking spirits.There would be no movie if the designer and the admiral didn't get together.  The ""conflict"" that must be resolved is between the military brats and the flower children.There is much to scoff at.  There are several frenzied scenes of physical comedy - all ending with Quaid covered with wet stuff.  With 20 family members there is scarcely a moment for any degree of character development.  Rip Torn is absolutely fantastic in the right role - here he is badly miscast as the Commandant of the Coast Guard.  At one point he is so pleased at the promotion of his subordinate Quaid that he lifts him off the ground in a big bear hug in one of those big Washington, D.C. rotundas.  All the Admirals I know in real life are slightly more reserved in large public places. A portion of the family conflict comes when Quaid's 2-star Admiral is nominated to become the replacement for 4-Star Torn.  This is about as realistic as the person who just got the job supervising orientation of new employees to the Ford Motor Company suddenly being named CEO.  I know this sort of plot device happens in film all the time, but even a kindergarden understanding of arithmetic would allow you to know that a 2-Star Admiral doesn't replace a 4-Star without that intermediate 3-Star step.Still - I liked it.  I liked the couple.  I liked the kids.  I wanted things to work out for them.I wouldn't cancel a trip to ""Pride and Prejudice"" or ""King Kong"" to see this, but if your kids or significant other drags you to it, don't run screaming.",4,"I Didn't Expect to Like It, but...",1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,3440,"['Yesterday', 'was', 'middle', 'child', '18th', 'birthday', 'part', 'festivities', 'was', 'trip', 'local', 'cinema', 'birthday', 'girl', 'choose', 'movie', 'know', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'choice', 'was', ""n't"", 'chosen', 'Mom', 'vetoed', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'compromise', 'choice', 'was', 'Yours', 'Mine', 'Ours', '.Just', 'going', 'out', 'door', 'checked', 'couple', 'on-line', 'reviews', 'Yikes', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'were', 'trashing', 'film', 'top', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'madcap', 'comedy', 'featuring', 'housefull', 'characters', 'gritted', 'teeth', 'vowed', 'not', 'complain', 'cast', 'shadow', 'sweet', '18', 'celebration.Okay', 'not', 'Casablanca', 'liked', 'movie', 'overcame', 'negative', 'expectations', 'won', 'numerous', 'flaws', 'Why', 'characters', 'drawn', 'broad', 'strokes', 'are', 'nonetheless', 'likable', 'found', 'rooting', 'going', 'final', 'act.Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'are', 'as', 'attractive', 'actors', 'age', 'get', 'characters', 'are', 'essentially', 'good', 'was', 'good', 'place', 'start.Quaid', '2-Star', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'Admiral', 'just', 'assigned', 'take', 'over', 'leadership', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'Academy', 'New', 'London', 'Connecticut', 'widower', 'several', 'years', 'brood', '8', 'kids', 'housekeeper', 'Linda', 'Hunt', 'Russo', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'still', 'living', 'there', 'New', 'London', 'also', 'widowed', '4', 'children', 'own', 'previous', 'spouse', 'adopted', '6', 'more', 'real', 'international', 'feeling', 'house', 'home', 'messily', 'creative', 'studio', 'designer', 'who', 'things', 'places', 'Saks', 'Fifth', 'Avenue.The', 'admiral', 'kids', 'are', 'quite', 'regimented', 'keep', 'tidy', 'ship', 'adhere', 'rigidly', 'written', 'schedules', 'call', 'father', 'Admiral', 'thought', 'sort', 'odd', '22', 'years', 'Navy', 'children', 'call', 'Dad', 'digress', 'Russo', 'raising', 'children', 'be', 'free-thinking', 'spirits.There', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'designer', 'admiral', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'together', 'conflict', 'must', 'be', 'resolved', 'military', 'brats', 'flower', 'children.There', 'much', 'scoff', 'are', 'several', 'frenzied', 'scenes', 'physical', 'comedy', 'ending', 'Quaid', 'covered', 'wet', 'stuff', '20', 'family', 'members', 'scarcely', 'moment', 'degree', 'character', 'development', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'right', 'role', 'here', 'badly', 'miscast', 'Commandant', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'one', 'point', 'so', 'pleased', 'promotion', 'subordinate', 'Quaid', 'off', 'ground', 'big', 'bear', 'hug', 'one', 'big', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'rotundas', 'Admirals', 'know', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'slightly', 'more', 'reserved', 'large', 'public', 'places', 'portion', 'family', 'conflict', 'when', 'Quaid', '2-star', 'Admiral', 'nominated', 'become', 'replacement', '4-Star', 'Torn', 'about', 'as', 'realistic', 'person', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'job', 'supervising', 'orientation', 'new', 'employees', 'Ford', 'Motor', 'Company', 'suddenly', 'being', 'named', 'CEO', 'know', 'sort', 'plot', 'device', 'film', 'time', 'even', 'kindergarden', 'understanding', 'arithmetic', 'would', 'allow', 'know', '2-Star', 'Admiral', ""n't"", 'replace', '4-Star', 'intermediate', '3-Star', 'step.Still', 'liked', 'liked', 'couple', 'liked', 'kids', 'wanted', 'things', 'work', 'out', 'them.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'cancel', 'trip', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'King', 'Kong', 'see', 'kids', 'significant', 'other', 'drags', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'screaming']",N/A

967713,A4JHEO7H330AF,B000E3LI4U,Tom Brody,"[2, 2]","YOURS, MINE, AND OURS, is distinguished in that the two main actors, Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo, are both genuine movie stars.  This movie is a remake of YOURS, MINE, AND OURS, a 1968 film, directed by Melville Shavelson and starring Lucille Ball, Henry Fonda and Van Johnson.  This 1968 film was based on the story of Frank and Helen Beardsley, as disclosed in Helen's autobiographical book Who Gets the Drumstick?My own familarity of Mr.Quaid is from his engaging performance in PARENT TRAP, featuring Lindsey Lohan.  My familarity of Ms.Russo is from THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE, starring the adorable Piper Perabo (in this movie, at least, she is adorable).  Both of these films are exceptionally-well crafted, at least in my opinion, and invite repeated viewings.  But I am not sure that I can say the same for YOURS, MINE, AND OURS.  YOURS, MINE, AND OURS, concerns a single father with around 8 children, and a single mother, also with around 8 children (or perhaps more).  The father (Mr.Quaid) and mother (Ms.Russo) had been high school sweethearts, and we are shown their photograph in their high school year book.The movie starts with Mr.Quaid leading his clan to New London, Connecticut, where he is to be in charge of a naval academy school.  His rank is admiral.  Mr.Quaid is an exceptional officer in the U.S.Coast Guard, and towards the end of the film, he is offered a position as Commandant (the highest rank obtainable in the U.S.Coast Guard).  Mr.Quaid's children express weariness at having to move to a new city every few years, due to the fact of their father's government position.  As it turns out, Mr.Quaid and Ms.Russo meet in New London, rekindle their high-school romance, and get married.  The result is a ""Brady Bunch"" scenario, where two groups of unrelated children are forced upon each other.This situation is both interesting and disappointing.  What is interesting is that the mother, and her children, are liberal hippie-types, who prefer disorder, hippie-clothes, and graffiti (and they have a pet pig).  In contrast, Mr.Quaid, as well as his children, prefer to be orderly, to have a scheduled life, and to be more mainstream.  The bulk of the movie contains slapstick comedy, where the contrasting (but not necessarily incompatible) life styles of the two families lead to mild forms of chaos.  YOURS, MINE & OURS seemed to contain at least ten scenes where somebody got his or her face covered with housepaint or mud.  If you like THE THREE STOOGES, then you will love YOURS, MINE & OURS.  The pinnacle of this slapstick chaos occurs in a large hardware store (Home Depot), where one of the children accidently commandeers a fork-lift, and drives it down the aisle, causing merchandise to tumble off the shelves.What is disappointing, is the fact that the two sets of children conspire to cause chaos and disorder, with the goal of driving their parents apart, and causing them to divorce.  While this is the overall thrust of the second half of the movie, the conspiracy element was poorly developed.  It seemed to me that the chaos naturally happened on its own.  Also, I find that the notion that two sets of children would conspire to drive their step-parents apart to be somewhat contrived.  The contrived nature of this premise or theme, and the continual use of mild slapstick, prevents the movie from being a ""keeper.""For people interested in movies showing the theme of ""chaos verus order"" in households filled with children, and where the parents are on the verge of splitting up, I recommend MRS.DOUBTFIRE and THE SOUND OF MUSIC.  It is easy to see that YOURS, MINE & OURS trods some of the same thematic material as is found in MRS.DOUBTFIRE and THE SOUND OF MUSIC.  It is also easy to see that MRS.DOUBTFIRE and THE SOUND OF MUSIC are works of art, and worthy of repeated viewings, and that the same cannot really be said of YOURS, MINE & OURS.  On the other hand, I cannot get enough of Mr.Quaid's squinky smile.  Mr.Quaid has acted in a number of movies featuring children, for example, the excellent PARENT TRAP with Ms.Lohan and THE ROOKIE.  The squinky smile is in abundance in these two fine films.  Ms.Russo is distinguished in that she looks a bit like Jacqueline Kennedy.",3,"A fine device for passing the time, if you have nothing else to do.",1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,4246,"['YOURS', 'MINE', 'AND', 'OURS', 'distinguished', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'Rene', 'Russo', 'are', 'genuine', 'movie', 'stars', 'movie', 'remake', 'YOURS', 'MINE', 'AND', 'OURS', '1968', 'film', 'directed', 'Melville', 'Shavelson', 'starring', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Van', 'Johnson', '1968', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'story', 'Frank', 'Helen', 'Beardsley', 'disclosed', 'Helen', 'autobiographical', 'book', 'Who', 'Drumstick', 'own', 'familarity', 'Mr.Quaid', 'engaging', 'performance', 'PARENT', 'TRAP', 'featuring', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'familarity', 'Ms.Russo', 'THE', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'ROCKY', 'AND', 'BULLWINKLE', 'starring', 'adorable', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'movie', 'least', 'adorable', 'films', 'are', 'exceptionally-well', 'crafted', 'least', 'opinion', 'invite', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'can', 'say', 'same', 'YOURS', 'MINE', 'AND', 'OURS', 'YOURS', 'MINE', 'AND', 'OURS', 'single', 'father', '8', 'children', 'single', 'mother', 'also', '8', 'children', 'perhaps', 'more', 'father', 'Mr.Quaid', 'mother', 'Ms.Russo', 'had', 'been', 'high', 'school', 'sweethearts', 'are', 'shown', 'photograph', 'high', 'school', 'year', 'book.The', 'movie', 'Mr.Quaid', 'leading', 'clan', 'New', 'London', 'Connecticut', 'where', 'be', 'charge', 'naval', 'academy', 'school', 'rank', 'admiral', 'Mr.Quaid', 'exceptional', 'officer', 'U.S.Coast', 'Guard', 'end', 'film', 'offered', 'position', 'Commandant', 'highest', 'rank', 'obtainable', 'U.S.Coast', 'Guard', 'Mr.Quaid', 'children', 'weariness', 'having', 'move', 'new', 'city', 'few', 'years', 'due', 'fact', 'father', 'government', 'position', 'out', 'Mr.Quaid', 'Ms.Russo', 'meet', 'New', 'London', 'rekindle', 'high-school', 'romance', 'get', 'married', 'result', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'scenario', 'where', 'two', 'groups', 'unrelated', 'children', 'are', 'forced', 'other.This', 'situation', 'interesting', 'disappointing', 'What', 'interesting', 'mother', 'children', 'are', 'liberal', 'hippie-types', 'who', 'prefer', 'disorder', 'hippie-clothes', 'graffiti', 'have', 'pet', 'pig', 'contrast', 'Mr.Quaid', 'as', 'well', 'children', 'prefer', 'be', 'orderly', 'have', 'scheduled', 'life', 'be', 'more', 'mainstream', 'bulk', 'movie', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'where', 'contrasting', 'not', 'necessarily', 'incompatible', 'life', 'styles', 'two', 'families', 'lead', 'mild', 'forms', 'chaos', 'YOURS', 'MINE', 'OURS', 'seemed', 'contain', 'least', 'ten', 'scenes', 'where', 'somebody', 'got', 'face', 'covered', 'housepaint', 'mud', 'like', 'THREE', 'STOOGES', 'then', 'will', 'love', 'YOURS', 'MINE', 'OURS', 'pinnacle', 'slapstick', 'chaos', 'large', 'hardware', 'store', 'Home', 'Depot', 'where', 'one', 'children', 'accidently', 'fork-lift', 'down', 'aisle', 'causing', 'merchandise', 'tumble', 'off', 'shelves.What', 'disappointing', 'fact', 'two', 'sets', 'children', 'conspire', 'cause', 'chaos', 'disorder', 'goal', 'driving', 'parents', 'apart', 'causing', 'divorce', 'overall', 'thrust', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'conspiracy', 'element', 'was', 'poorly', 'developed', 'seemed', 'chaos', 'naturally', 'happened', 'own', 'Also', 'find', 'notion', 'two', 'sets', 'children', 'would', 'conspire', 'drive', 'step-parents', 'apart', 'be', 'somewhat', 'contrived', 'contrived', 'nature', 'premise', 'theme', 'continual', 'use', 'mild', 'slapstick', 'movie', 'being', 'keeper', 'people', 'interested', 'movies', 'showing', 'theme', 'chaos', 'verus', 'order', 'households', 'filled', 'children', 'where', 'parents', 'are', 'verge', 'splitting', 'up', 'recommend', 'MRS.DOUBTFIRE', 'THE', 'SOUND', 'OF', 'MUSIC', 'easy', 'see', 'YOURS', 'MINE', 'OURS', 'same', 'thematic', 'material', 'found', 'MRS.DOUBTFIRE', 'THE', 'SOUND', 'OF', 'MUSIC', 'also', 'easy', 'see', 'MRS.DOUBTFIRE', 'THE', 'SOUND', 'OF', 'MUSIC', 'are', 'works', 'art', 'worthy', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'be', 'said', 'YOURS', 'MINE', 'OURS', 'other', 'hand', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'Mr.Quaid', 'squinky', 'smile', 'Mr.Quaid', 'acted', 'number', 'movies', 'featuring', 'children', 'example', 'excellent', 'PARENT', 'TRAP', 'Ms.Lohan', 'THE', 'ROOKIE', 'squinky', 'smile', 'abundance', 'two', 'fine', 'films', 'Ms.Russo', 'distinguished', 'bit', 'Jacqueline', 'Kennedy']",N/A

The only good thing about the newer version is the kids (and some of them would be seen in a much better film sooner or later), so if you a fan of, say, Dean Collins, please stop reading this review here, take a look at the film and enjoy yourself.But I'm talking about the film itself, and Dennis Quaid & Rene Russo, and what I am going to say is not very nice. To their credits, they truly look like two adults Frank and Helen, widowed Coast Guard Admiral and widowed designer, who had been romantically linked to each other when high school students. Their story is sweet, romantic and convincing. Sadly their story ends in five minutes.The rest of the film is about the predictable culture clash comedy between two sets of values with lots of badly-constructed pratfalls. Frank is an uptight military person while Helen is a free-thinking vegetarian. Frank has 8 children while Helen 10 (including the adopted kids). Frank demands his home should be `shipshape' while Helen wants her kids always `free.' So what would happen if they live in a same place?One of the two terrible things about `Yours, Mine, and Ours' is its awfully made slapsticks which are just embarrassing to see. If you think it funny to see someone slipping over vomit on a yacht, or Dennis Quaid soaked in green slime, this is your film. And you can also see Mr. Quaid kissing a pig. Rene Russo is not the same sexy woman you have seen in `The Thomas Crown Affair,' but her stand-in who looks very tired.But the most annoying thing is the characters of the kids (or what they do). These spoiled children are not only allowed to eat a bucketful of sweets, but they plan to break up the relations between Frank and Helen just because they want to live as they want! Of course they relent after getting what they want, and cue to the sappy ending.This messy and unfunny comedy comes from four big names - MGM, Paramount, Nickelodeon and Columbia. The images are crisp, and shot in widescreen.

Needless to say, I was shocked to see the number of low-star critics on here complaining about how two-star Coast Guard admiral Quaid is a ""heartless dictator"" and Rene Russo being one of those ""born free"" types, and their kids are ""a bunch of brats trying to break up the household to get what they want."" I am a critic myself, and thought I would put in a few words of wisdom in here.First of all, it seems like ALL kids are a bunch of brats that do whatever it takes in order to do what they want, so 18 kids in a household plotting to break up their parent's marriage is the perfect stereotype for American kids today, and the critics know this the same as me, but are just too afraid to admit it, so they give out low scores because the movie is dipped a little bit too much in the reality of spoiled American kids today and it scares them.And there is nothing wrong with the Coast Guard admiral trying to keep a little ""law and order"" in his household. First off, it's a repeat of the father in ""The Sound of Music"" who is a former Navy officer, and my father, who was a staff sergeant in the Air Force, was pretty much the same way when I was growing up. And I also believe the concept that even though the parents are completely different from each other, they seem to be the perfect match anyway in the end, and the kids realize this, so they flag down the admiral on that Coast Guard ship from the yacht to make him realize that as well. I thought that a team of kids who wanted them to split up in the first place realized in the end that it was all a big mistake. When I watched the movie, I thought it was VERY funny and realistic, and laughed all through the scene where it has that kid taking a joyride on that machine in the store and causing complete havoc in the meantime, then the ""trashed house"" scene and the reaction to Dennis Quaid when he saw it. So without regret, I placed my order for this movie, because after my experience in watching that DVD, I'll pay top dollar just to be able to place it on my shelf and call it mine.I am ashamed of these low-star critics that don't know a funny movie when they see one. I bet they jumped all over the ""Cheaper By the Dozen"" movies because they find it ""unrealistic"" that a couple could raise 12 children. Well, this movie is a lot like that, and with a lot of laughs, and I grade it 5-stars for it's comedy. I especially admire the part where a lot of the kids happen to be adopted. After all, how could you have your own kids without thinking about the other kids out there that also deserve a good family?

He also happens to be a widower with 8 children.  For his newest command, he moves back to his home town, where he meets up with his high school sweetheart (Rene Russo).  Russo is a free-wheeling designer of fashion bags; she also happens to be a single parent to 10 kids (some of hers are adopted from different cultures, giving her family a very Angelina Jolie vibe).  The couple rekindles their romance and hastily marries, much to the dismay of their children.  The new family moves into a dilapidated lighthouse, which they soon have looking like something out of Martha Stewart ""Living"" or Pottery Barn; in other words, completely synthetic, which also sums up just about everything from this rather boring family comedy.The plot concerns the family trying to resolve their differences - his kids are used discipline and structure, whereas her kids keep a pig in the house and play loud instruments.  Not surprisingly, the kids have conflict and decide to break up their parents.  To do so, they have to work together; will they succeed or will their plotting make them a family?  (*rolls eyes*)  Unfortunately, the laughs are few and far between, and come mostly from Linda Hunt as their housekeeper.  The direction is clumsy, and the writing relies on lame slapstick and cloying from the kids.  I didn't enjoy this movie at all, and I cannot imagine that anyone would except possibly very young children (6 years or younger).
