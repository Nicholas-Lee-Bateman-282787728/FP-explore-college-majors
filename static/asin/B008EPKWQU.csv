However, I must say, I was really surprised at how much I even enjoyed watching this movie.Like ""Day of the Diesels"", this movie covers territory that many kids' movies and books have covered, in this case dealing with feeling as though one has done something so unforgivable that one must hide or run away.  Among the nice things about this adventure is that Thomas remains the main character of the film, but he's trying to figure out the circumstances of something that happened long ago, hence the mystery.  In his quest, at one point the engines in Tidmouth sheds are recalling incidents where they didn't do the right thing, and still didn't get sent away - even (the sometimes devious) Diesel.  (It illustrates very nicely the idea that parents don't withdraw love from children just because they are naughty.)In any case, this is a really sweet, really watchable movie, and I hope that any other Thomas movies following it take their cue for telling a compelling story from this one.",5,"After ""Day of the Diesels"", a very pleasant surprise",1378252800,"09 4, 2013",2013,1120,"['Having', 'recently', 'watched', 'Day', 'Diesels', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'had', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'Blue', 'Mountain', 'Mystery', 'However', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie.Like', 'Day', 'Diesels', 'movie', 'territory', 'many', 'kids', 'movies', 'books', 'have', 'covered', 'case', 'dealing', 'feeling', 'one', 'done', 'something', 'so', 'unforgivable', 'one', 'must', 'hide', 'run', 'away', 'nice', 'things', 'adventure', 'Thomas', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'circumstances', 'something', 'happened', 'long', 'ago', 'hence', 'mystery', 'quest', 'one', 'point', 'engines', 'Tidmouth', 'sheds', 'are', 'recalling', 'incidents', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'sent', 'away', 'even', 'sometimes', 'devious', 'Diesel', 'very', 'nicely', 'idea', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'withdraw', 'love', 'children', 'just', 'are', 'naughty', 'case', 'really', 'sweet', 'really', 'watchable', 'movie', 'hope', 'other', 'Thomas', 'movies', 'following', 'take', 'cue', 'telling', 'compelling', 'story', 'one']",N/A

1551258,A2WW57XX2UVLM6,B008EPKWQU,Talvi,"[24, 31]","My 4 year old Thomas fanatic and I were able to see Blue Mountain Mystery at Showcase Cinemas' Kidtoons.  He was so excited, and it didn't disappoint!  Even better, I loved it.  One thing that is important to me is realism, and unlike prior Thomas movies where Thomas floats on water and logs magically get tossed by Wheezy onto flatbeds, this movie was much more realistic.This story heralds a return many of the ""old"" familiars, including many on the narrow gauge engine line that we don't see very often in the current Thomas the Tank Engine series on TV like Rheneas, Skarloey, and Rusty.  Annie and Clarabel have some really cute spots with Thomas on his Branch Line that had the whole theater laughing. His relationship with them is charming.Blue Mountain Mystery also introduces us to some fun new characters: Merrick the quarry crane, Luke the narrow gauge engine, Owen the quarry lift, and Winston the crazy rail-mobile that Sir Topham Hatt drives (very laugh-inducing to watch the car's sudden start-stops and wrong direction driving mishaps).SPOILER ALERT: I'm going to give some spoilers here so that you know if this is something that you'd want to show your children, nieces, nephews, grandchildren, friends, etc.  I'm not going to reveal the mystery though!The story opens with a bridge accident at the quarry - my son has always been fascinated with bridges and has re-enacted bridge crashes a million times with his Thomas sets.  Most of the workers at the quarry are narrow gauge engines and they are on friendly terms with Thomas. He then sees a darting little green engine a few times, but when he asks around, everyone avoids his questions blushingly. You know something is up, and the mystery builds.Once Thomas hears more of the story, his interest is piqued.  He finds out that the little green engine's name is Luke, and Luke puts his trust in Thomas when he tells him the story.  He's hiding out because he thinks he'll be sent away from Sodor if he is found.  When he came to Sodor originally, he was so excited that he demanded that he get taken off the barge first...and ended up crashing into a little yellow engine that spoke a foreign language, dropping him into the sea!Diesel engine Paxton overhears the story and tells oily Diesel, who has been a very naughty engine over the last few years.  In this movie, Thomas even thinks of the time in Misty Island Rescue when Diesel stole the flatbeds of jobi wood and ended up crashing all the wood into the sea.  Diesel spends the rest of the movie trying to alert the authorities to Luke's presence in the quarry, saying that he is a dangerous engine that pushes other engines into the sea.The mystery intensifies, and Thomas rushes to prove himself and of course finds himself in danger. The movie reveals the origin story for one of the engines that was introduced in a Thomas movie and everything is wrapped up nicely, including a scolding from Sir Topham Hatt for causing ""confusion and delay!""We have already ordered theThomas The Train: TrackMaster Risky Rails Bridge Drop.",5,"Superb tale of mystery, trust, and doing the right thing!",1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,3058,"['4', 'year', 'old', 'Thomas', 'fanatic', 'were', 'able', 'see', 'Blue', 'Mountain', 'Mystery', 'Showcase', 'Cinemas', 'Kidtoons', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'Even', 'better', 'loved', 'One', 'thing', 'important', 'realism', 'prior', 'Thomas', 'movies', 'where', 'Thomas', 'water', 'logs', 'magically', 'get', 'tossed', 'Wheezy', 'flatbeds', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'realistic.This', 'story', 'return', 'many', 'old', 'familiars', 'including', 'many', 'narrow', 'gauge', 'engine', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'very', 'often', 'current', 'Thomas', 'Tank', 'Engine', 'series', 'TV', 'Rheneas', 'Skarloey', 'Rusty', 'Annie', 'Clarabel', 'have', 'really', 'cute', 'spots', 'Thomas', 'Branch', 'Line', 'had', 'whole', 'theater', 'laughing', 'relationship', 'charming.Blue', 'Mountain', 'Mystery', 'also', 'fun', 'new', 'characters', 'Merrick', 'quarry', 'crane', 'Luke', 'narrow', 'gauge', 'engine', 'Owen', 'quarry', 'lift', 'Winston', 'crazy', 'rail-mobile', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'drives', 'very', 'laugh-inducing', 'watch', 'car', 'sudden', 'start-stops', 'wrong', 'direction', 'driving', 'mishaps', '.SPOILER', ""'m"", 'going', 'give', 'spoilers', 'here', 'so', 'know', 'something', ""'d"", 'want', 'show', 'children', 'nieces', 'nephews', 'grandchildren', 'friends', 'etc', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'reveal', 'mystery', 'story', 'bridge', 'accident', 'quarry', 'son', 'always', 'been', 'fascinated', 'bridges', 're-enacted', 'bridge', 'million', 'times', 'Thomas', 'sets', 'Most', 'workers', 'quarry', 'are', 'narrow', 'gauge', 'engines', 'are', 'friendly', 'terms', 'Thomas', 'then', 'darting', 'little', 'green', 'engine', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'around', 'everyone', 'avoids', 'questions', 'blushingly', 'know', 'something', 'up', 'mystery', 'builds.Once', 'Thomas', 'more', 'story', 'interest', 'piqued', 'out', 'little', 'green', 'engine', 'name', 'Luke', 'Luke', 'trust', 'Thomas', 'when', 'story', 'hiding', 'out', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sent', 'away', 'Sodor', 'found', 'When', 'came', 'Sodor', 'originally', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'demanded', 'get', 'taken', 'off', 'barge', 'first', 'ended', 'up', 'crashing', 'little', 'yellow', 'engine', 'spoke', 'foreign', 'language', 'dropping', 'sea', 'Diesel', 'engine', 'Paxton', 'story', 'tells', 'oily', 'Diesel', 'who', 'been', 'very', 'naughty', 'engine', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'movie', 'Thomas', 'even', 'time', 'Misty', 'Island', 'Rescue', 'when', 'Diesel', 'stole', 'flatbeds', 'jobi', 'wood', 'ended', 'up', 'crashing', 'wood', 'sea', 'Diesel', 'rest', 'movie', 'trying', 'alert', 'authorities', 'Luke', 'presence', 'quarry', 'saying', 'dangerous', 'engine', 'other', 'engines', 'sea.The', 'mystery', 'intensifies', 'Thomas', 'rushes', 'prove', 'course', 'danger', 'movie', 'origin', 'story', 'one', 'engines', 'was', 'introduced', 'Thomas', 'movie', 'everything', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nicely', 'including', 'scolding', 'Sir', 'Topham', 'Hatt', 'causing', 'confusion', 'delay', 'have', 'already', 'ordered', 'Train', 'TrackMaster', 'Risky', 'Rails', 'Bridge', 'Drop']",N/A
1551259,A1441JD62UV8IR,B008EPKWQU,Techy DVD Guy,"[12, 15]","Blue Mountain Mystery revolves around Luke, a small green narrow gauge engine. He's afraid he'll be sent away if anyone finds out what he did. Through investigation and hard work, Thomas befriends Luke and learns what happened. After hearing Luke's story, Thomas sets off to find the yellow engine who fell off the boat.BMM is a major improvement from the poorly constructed ""Day of the Diesels"" and the awful ""Misty Island Rescue"". The dialogue is no longer forced and there is not exaggeration on words. The film also has some hidden easter eggs on the biggest of Thomas fans will notice. Such are: The Marklin Engine (in scrap form) at the Dieselworks, The ""Rolling Eyes"" effect, etc. It's also the first time the Narrow Gauge engines are seen in FULL CGI!The discs, on the other hand, are a mystery themselves. This is the first Thomas disc to be released in its native 23.976 frame rate. This allows for better quality overall throughout the film. But the main problem is the audio and the length.The film runs (on the disc) for 1:03:58. It's supposed to be 1:01:27. Somewhere along the line, the film was slowed down and can be noticed in certain audio sequences.The 5.1 DTS Mix is another problem. There is a lot of phasing and ""channel-switching"". This can be heard during the WORKING TOGETHER song in the beginning of the film. Listen carefully to the sound effects as well. It's painful to listen to a mix THIS bad.Overall, with all technical aspects aside, BMM is a must own for any Thomas fan. The kids, and even the adults, will enjoy this sweet tale of the little green engine.",5,"Fantastic Film, Bad Discs",1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,1591,"['Blue', 'Mountain', 'Mystery', 'Luke', 'small', 'green', 'narrow', 'gauge', 'engine', 'afraid', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sent', 'away', 'anyone', 'out', 'what', 'did', 'investigation', 'hard', 'work', 'Thomas', 'Luke', 'what', 'happened', 'hearing', 'Luke', 'story', 'Thomas', 'find', 'yellow', 'engine', 'who', 'fell', 'off', 'boat.BMM', 'major', 'improvement', 'poorly', 'constructed', 'Day', 'Diesels', 'awful', 'Misty', 'Island', 'Rescue', 'dialogue', 'longer', 'forced', 'not', 'exaggeration', 'words', 'film', 'also', 'hidden', 'easter', 'eggs', 'biggest', 'Thomas', 'fans', 'will', 'notice', 'Such', 'are', 'Marklin', 'Engine', 'scrap', 'form', 'Dieselworks', 'Rolling', 'Eyes', 'effect', 'etc', 'also', 'first', 'time', 'Narrow', 'Gauge', 'engines', 'are', 'seen', 'FULL', 'CGI', 'discs', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'mystery', 'first', 'Thomas', 'disc', 'be', 'released', 'native', '23.976', 'frame', 'rate', 'better', 'quality', 'overall', 'film', 'main', 'problem', 'audio', 'length.The', 'film', 'runs', 'disc', '1:03:58', 'supposed', 'be', '1:01:27', 'Somewhere', 'line', 'film', 'was', 'slowed', 'down', 'can', 'be', 'noticed', 'certain', 'audio', 'sequences.The', '5.1', 'DTS', 'Mix', 'problem', 'lot', 'phasing', 'channel-switching', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'WORKING', 'TOGETHER', 'song', 'beginning', 'film', 'Listen', 'carefully', 'sound', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'painful', 'listen', 'mix', 'THIS', 'bad.Overall', 'technical', 'aspects', 'aside', 'BMM', 'must', 'own', 'Thomas', 'fan', 'kids', 'even', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'sweet', 'tale', 'little', 'green', 'engine']",N/A
