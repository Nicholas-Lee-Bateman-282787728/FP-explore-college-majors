Jones,"[11, 11]","Amazing collection of porn trailers, most are pre-condom ones from the days when sex was pretty safe.They go for an average of 2 to 4 minutes and feature all the porn stars you grew up into manhood with, I merely bought this to add to the 42nd St trailer Collection and have only watched it once (so far) but it is a good compilation with very erotic full on clips.One thing puzzled me though, there is a trailer on here for Dracula Erotica which if I remember correctly was a porn film (that was cut to an R rating here in Australia in VHS days) and it's the cut version here.Which made me wonder why it was here as it stands out as the only tame trailer in this set.You get 2 hours and 20 minutes of very adult entertainment and before people get stroppy with this review, there is a saying.90% of the male adult world watches porn at some time and 10% simply out and out deny it, now which percentage are you?",5,For Those Times When Things Get Real Sticky,1288224000,"10 28, 2010",2010,912,"['Amazing', 'collection', 'porn', 'trailers', 'most', 'are', 'pre-condom', 'ones', 'days', 'when', 'sex', 'was', 'pretty', 'safe.They', 'go', 'average', '2', '4', 'minutes', 'feature', 'porn', 'stars', 'grew', 'up', 'manhood', 'merely', 'bought', 'add', '42nd', 'St', 'trailer', 'Collection', 'have', 'only', 'watched', 'once', 'so', 'far', 'good', 'compilation', 'very', 'erotic', 'full', 'clips.One', 'thing', 'puzzled', 'trailer', 'here', 'Dracula', 'Erotica', 'remember', 'correctly', 'was', 'porn', 'film', 'was', 'cut', 'R', 'rating', 'here', 'Australia', 'VHS', 'days', 'cut', 'version', 'here.Which', 'made', 'wonder', 'why', 'was', 'here', 'out', 'only', 'tame', 'trailer', 'set.You', 'get', '2', 'hours', '20', 'minutes', 'very', 'adult', 'entertainment', 'people', 'get', 'stroppy', 'review', 'saying.90', '%', 'male', 'adult', 'world', 'porn', 'time', '10', '%', 'simply', 'out', 'deny', 'now', 'percentage', 'are']",N/A

Covering a whole range from action to horror to raunchy comedies to sci-fi, this DVD collects nearly all genres. The highlight of the show is a very entertaining commentary by Fangoria Editor Mike Gingold, AvManiacs Editor Edwin Samuelson and film historian Chris Poggiali, as they give mini reviews for the movie that each trailer represents.If you like trailers then you'll love these.Be warned though; the trailers themselves are in rough shape and they have been cropped so they can be better viewed in a widescreen TV.",4,"Great Collection of Trailers, Great DVD",1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,676,"['42nd', 'Street', 'Forever', 'Vol', '3', 'Exploitation', 'Explosion', 'hour', 'forty-one', 'minutes', 'zaniest', 'trailers', 'seventies', 'eighties', 'Covering', 'whole', 'range', 'action', 'horror', 'raunchy', 'comedies', 'sci-fi', 'DVD', 'nearly', 'genres', 'highlight', 'show', 'very', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'Fangoria', 'Editor', 'Mike', 'Gingold', 'AvManiacs', 'Editor', 'Edwin', 'Samuelson', 'film', 'historian', 'Chris', 'Poggiali', 'give', 'mini', 'reviews', 'movie', 'trailer', 'represents.If', 'trailers', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'these.Be', 'warned', 'trailers', 'are', 'rough', 'shape', 'have', 'been', 'cropped', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'viewed', 'widescreen', 'TV']",N/A

1038257,A2MF0N72JVXDAP,B000LC3IMO,The Phantom,"[3, 3]","This rewinds society to a time when pornography was far less accepted, yet far more humane. The women were beautiful and natural (although admittedly they went a little overboard on the body hair in most cases), and glory be, they actually appeared to enjoy the sex that they were having on camera and didn't do it as if they were making a half-hearted attempt at giving male viewers what they thought that men liked. In other words, nothing like the pornography of today. And, wowzers, the men actually appeared to be sexually respectful of their female counterparts, and did nothing to be intentionally degrading. In other words, nothing like the pornography of today.This was sex for the joy of it, because it felt good, with no sort of psychological BS attached where the women acted out of veiled deep-seated hatred of the men and the men acted out of veiled deep-seated hatred of the women.The films were actually films, with characters and plotlines and stories and scripts, and actual actors and actresses who actually good act!In other words, nothing like the pornography of today.It's amazing how much things have changed even since the mid '80s. These trailers (more than two hours of them!) date from as late as that time, and as early as--well, not sure, because they aren't all dated, but a good guess would be the late '70s. It's a fascinating trip back through time as long as you aren't too prudish, because these are full-on uncensored trailers for full-on hard-core movies.P.S. This could be Ron Jeremy's resume on disc. He's in a ton of these, and as goofy and hilarious as you'd expect--even as a much more svelte version of himself.",5,Amazing,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",2012,1654,"['society', 'time', 'when', 'pornography', 'was', 'far', 'less', 'accepted', 'yet', 'far', 'more', 'humane', 'women', 'were', 'beautiful', 'natural', 'admittedly', 'went', 'little', 'overboard', 'body', 'hair', 'most', 'cases', 'glory', 'be', 'actually', 'appeared', 'enjoy', 'sex', 'were', 'having', 'camera', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'were', 'making', 'half-hearted', 'attempt', 'giving', 'male', 'viewers', 'what', 'thought', 'men', 'liked', 'other', 'words', 'nothing', 'pornography', 'today', 'wowzers', 'men', 'actually', 'appeared', 'be', 'sexually', 'respectful', 'female', 'counterparts', 'did', 'nothing', 'be', 'intentionally', 'degrading', 'other', 'words', 'nothing', 'pornography', 'today.This', 'was', 'sex', 'joy', 'felt', 'good', 'sort', 'psychological', 'BS', 'attached', 'where', 'women', 'acted', 'veiled', 'deep-seated', 'hatred', 'men', 'men', 'acted', 'veiled', 'deep-seated', 'hatred', 'women.The', 'films', 'were', 'actually', 'films', 'characters', 'plotlines', 'stories', 'scripts', 'actual', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'actually', 'good', 'act', 'other', 'words', 'nothing', 'pornography', 'today.It', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'even', 'mid', 'trailers', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'date', 'as', 'late', 'time', 'as', 'early', 'well', 'not', 'sure', 'are', ""n't"", 'all', 'dated', 'good', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'late', ""'70s"", 'fascinating', 'trip', 'back', 'through', 'time', 'as', 'long', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'prudish', 'are', 'full-on', 'uncensored', 'trailers', 'full-on', 'hard-core', 'movies.P.S', 'could', 'be', 'Ron', 'Jeremy', 'resume', 'disc', 'ton', 'goofy', 'hilarious', ""'d"", 'expect', 'even', 'much', 'more', 'svelte', 'version']",N/A
