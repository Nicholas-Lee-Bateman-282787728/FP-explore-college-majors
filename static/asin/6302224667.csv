The book by David Morrell &quot;The Brotherhood Of The Rose&quot; is my favorite book of all-time. As we all know, most adaptations of books don't go so well. This is a rare exception. This adaptation is 99% accurate. A change here or there, especially the ending, but still a great job. Read the book, then watch the movie...and then realize that I was right!

302466,A1L2HUQ1HAPE1G,6302224667,"G. Richards ""econ1955""","[1, 1]","Dating from 1989, Brotherhood of the Rose was a TV miniseries about international espionage.  Unlike many spy dramas, the plot is not particularly convoluted, but is actually quite straightforward.  Running about three hours, the story centers on agent who carries out an assassination, but soon comes to realize that he has been set up.  Teaming up with his part-time girlfriend and long-time partner, he discovers an international conspiracy involving several intelligence agencies.  Filmed almost entirely in New Zealand, the cold, rainy landscapes reinforce the sense of bleakness and desolation in the protagonist's mind.  The main problem is that the drama is very slow moving in places.  This version has not been extensively re-edited, and still incorporates the logos shown between advertising breaks, which unfortunately tends to break up the continuity.",3,TV espionage,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,864,"['Dating', '1989', 'Brotherhood', 'Rose', 'was', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'international', 'espionage', 'many', 'spy', 'dramas', 'plot', 'not', 'particularly', 'convoluted', 'actually', 'quite', 'straightforward', 'Running', 'about', 'three', 'hours', 'story', 'centers', 'agent', 'who', 'out', 'assassination', 'soon', 'realize', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'Teaming', 'up', 'part-time', 'girlfriend', 'long-time', 'partner', 'international', 'conspiracy', 'involving', 'several', 'intelligence', 'agencies', 'Filmed', 'almost', 'entirely', 'New', 'Zealand', 'cold', 'rainy', 'landscapes', 'reinforce', 'sense', 'bleakness', 'desolation', 'protagonist', 'mind', 'main', 'problem', 'drama', 'very', 'slow', 'moving', 'places', 'version', 'not', 'been', 'extensively', 're-edited', 'still', 'logos', 'shown', 'advertising', 'breaks', 'unfortunately', 'break', 'up', 'continuity']",N/A
