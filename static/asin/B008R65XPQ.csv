The Iditerod is the race that was run from Nenana to Nome in order to bring medicine to Nome to combat a Diptheria Outbreak. Balto did finish the race, so that much was true. In this tale Balto is an underdog who is ostrasized because he is half wolf. With a Russian Goose as his mentor and friend and two polar bears who cannot swim, Balto sets off to prove that he is capable of being a sled dog when the team gets lost and leads the team home.In Wolf Quest, he and his young daughter follow a raven to a more spiritual journey to help a pack of wolves facing starvation to seek a way to reach the Caribou that have gone over pack ice to reach a far shore and both soon learn where they actually belong. I love the double pack as it cuts down on space and yet allows both movies to be enjoyed as they are.",5,"Not Disney, but pretty good nonetheless....",1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,899,"['enjoyed', 'wonderful', 'little', 'story', 'events', 'were', 'dog', 'point', 'view', 'Iditerod', 'race', 'was', 'run', 'Nenana', 'Nome', 'order', 'bring', 'medicine', 'Nome', 'combat', 'Diptheria', 'Outbreak', 'Balto', 'did', 'finish', 'race', 'that', 'much', 'was', 'true', 'tale', 'Balto', 'underdog', 'who', 'ostrasized', 'half', 'wolf', 'Russian', 'Goose', 'mentor', 'friend', 'two', 'polar', 'bears', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'swim', 'Balto', 'prove', 'capable', 'being', 'sled', 'dog', 'when', 'team', 'lost', 'team', 'home.In', 'Wolf', 'Quest', 'young', 'daughter', 'follow', 'raven', 'more', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'help', 'pack', 'wolves', 'facing', 'starvation', 'seek', 'way', 'reach', 'Caribou', 'have', 'gone', 'pack', 'ice', 'reach', 'far', 'shore', 'soon', 'learn', 'where', 'actually', 'belong', 'love', 'double', 'pack', 'down', 'space', 'yet', 'movies', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'are']",N/A
