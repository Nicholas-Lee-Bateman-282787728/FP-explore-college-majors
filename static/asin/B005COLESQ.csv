It shipped ontime, the price was great, and they arrived with out any scratches. What I was not happy with is that it did ship wit out the protective plastic and that got me worried about damage.",4,Good play,1357257600,"01 4, 2013",2013,308,"['know', 'first', 'movie', 'others', 'are', 'cheesie', 'not', 'movie', 'review', 'product', 'review', 'shipped', 'ontime', 'price', 'was', 'great', 'arrived', 'out', 'scratches', 'What', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'did', 'ship', 'wit', 'protective', 'plastic', 'got', 'worried', 'damage']",Lost Boys Collection

Lost Boys The Tribe is the second one 20 years later, the only few original cast are in this movie, but you viewers would have to find out. And lastly the Lost Boys the Thirst is the 3rd and final one. You have to see how it turns out.",5,Lost Boys collection,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,346,"['Awesome', 'set', 'movies', 'starting', 'off', 'original', 'Lost', 'Boys', '1987', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'back', 'then', 'Lost', 'Tribe', 'second', 'one', '20', 'years', 'later', 'only', 'few', 'original', 'cast', 'are', 'movie', 'viewers', 'would', 'have', 'find', 'out', 'lastly', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'Thirst', '3rd', 'final', 'one', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out']",Lost Boys Collection

He has a terrific instinct with his acting.  I was surprised to see the late Jason Miller's son, Jason Patric (Jackie Gleason's grandson!) in it, as well!!  Handsome guy & a good actor.  His sensitivity in the role is reminiscent of his father's acting, but without all of the torment etched into his face.  The man should write a book!!!  What a family tree!!Anyway the first film is great, if you're not terrified by the HAIRstyles!!!  The other two...you'd be better off just buying the first by itself, unless you're a diehard fan of this genre.",4,Sutherland is SO good!!,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,632,"['Sutherland', 'really', 'fine', 'actor', 'nothing', 'dated', 'performances', 'terrific', 'instinct', 'acting', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'late', 'Jason', 'Miller', 'son', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'grandson', 'as', 'well', 'Handsome', 'guy', 'good', 'actor', 'sensitivity', 'role', 'reminiscent', 'father', 'acting', 'torment', 'etched', 'face', 'man', 'should', 'write', 'book', 'What', 'family', 'tree', 'Anyway', 'first', 'film', 'great', ""'re"", 'not', 'terrified', 'HAIRstyles', 'other', 'two', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'just', 'buying', 'first', ""'re"", 'diehard', 'fan', 'genre']",Lost Boys Collection
