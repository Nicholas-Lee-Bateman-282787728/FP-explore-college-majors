670918,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005O06N,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 5]","Trying to figure out a header for this review epitomizes the problems that I have with this very middling Woody Allen film. Readers of this space know that I have done many reviews of Allen's films, as actor, director or both but this one annoys me no end. In short, not all Woody Allen movies are created equal. The premise behind this one is potentially interesting, perhaps more so today than when the film was originally produced- a send up of our celebrity-crazed society.With Allen playing the role of a human chameleon in the Jazz Age there certainly were possibilities for a funny look at how the geeks look at a fellow geek but it falls flat. Why? I believe that here Allen just went back and found every sight gag and clich&eacute; that he had already used in many previous films- the bow (or finger) to Freud, Marx, the New York intelligentsia (here Irving Howe and Susan Sontag), Jewish childhoods, fascination with gentile women (here Mia Farrow, as an chain smoking experimental psychiatrist) and so forth.If this list sounds familiar to Allen fans then you have the sense of my feelings on this film. Woody flat ran out of steam on this one. Fortunately there is plenty of other work by Allen to pick from.

670919,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005O06N,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I absolutely LOVE that this is called `the thinking persons `Forrest Gump'' because we all know how I feel about that mediocre film, and the fact that this film, while carrying with it similar characteristics, manages to blow that Tom Hanks atrocity out of the water is just so richly rewarding for me.  `Zelig' is smart, engaging, unique and unforgettable.1983 is a weird year for me.  There is a lot going on that I really wanted to just love but wound up feeling completely under-whelmed by (I really thought that `Scarface' was supposed to be some great big heap of awesome but it wound up being a well acted heap of sloppy, and `The Year of Living Dangerously' seemed to squander all its potential in a predictable love story) and yet, my personal Best Picture ballot is an odd mix of films I never expected to remotely enjoy.  We have a foreign language family drama from Ingmar Bergman (ok, so I really expected to slobber all over `Fanny and Alexander' and I did), an engaging and provoking collection of home movies (`Sans Soleil' is just utterly astonishing), the conclusion to George Lucas's science fiction epic (say what you will, but `Return of the Jedi' is just as perfect as the previous two efforts were), a comedy by Martin Scorsese (`The King of Comedy' changed the way I looked at Martin Scorsese as a director) and this BRILLIANT faux-documentary by Woody Allen.Narrated by Patrick Horgan (in true documented fashion), `Zelig' tells the story of Leonard Zelig, a man with a strange social disease that causes him to change his physical and emotional makeup in order to adapt to his surroundings.  He changes his speak patterns, his life story and his physical appearance in order to blend into his surroundings.  Dr. Eudora Nesbitt Fletcher becomes obsessed with uncovering the reasons behind Zelig's condition.  Through recorded sessions we learn about an uncomfortable situation where Zelig is asked if he has read a popular novel only to lie to escape embarrassment, thus initiating his conformity.For me, this film speaks strongly on two subjects; our instinctive desire to fit in and our instinctive desire to shun what we don't understand.  Zelig desires to be liked so much that he uncontrollably conforms to his surroundings.  As a result he becomes shunned as an even greater outcast by those who uncover his strange ability.Without ever coming across preachy or saccharine (not in the SLIGHTEST), `Zelig' tells us that it is okay to be different, it is better to be ourselves and it is okay to accept something we personally don't understand.Woody Allen and Mia Farrow are great here, perfectly adapting themselves into the films genre.  I don't know if you can really classify this as acting, since they really appear in a series of photographs (some of which are altered flawlessly) and a few scattered clips, but there is an effortless quality to their work here.  What is even more commendable is Woody Allen's direction.  The look and feel of this film is so genuine and authentic that you would swear you were watching a real documentary.It is astonishing, truly.I am not a huge fan of the documentary (although I am always fascinated by the BBC documentaries because they are so bizarre), and I know that this is not a `documentary' in the literal sense (since it is purely fiction) but this film flows like a documentary, of the most engrossing kind.  It's worth noting that this is NOT a mockumentary or a parody in any way shape or form.  This is a very serious film despite its comical qualities and should be regarded as such.  I applaud Woody Allen, because I really don't think any other director could have pulled this off quite like he did.",5,The best documentary that isn't really a documentary I've ever seen...,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,3687,"['absolutely', 'LOVE', 'called', 'thinking', 'persons', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'know', 'how', 'feel', 'mediocre', 'film', 'fact', 'film', 'carrying', 'similar', 'characteristics', 'blow', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'atrocity', 'water', 'just', 'so', 'richly', 'rewarding', 'Zelig', 'smart', 'engaging', 'unique', 'unforgettable.1983', 'weird', 'year', 'lot', 'going', 'really', 'wanted', 'just', 'love', 'wound', 'up', 'feeling', 'completely', 'under-whelmed', 'really', 'thought', 'Scarface', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'great', 'big', 'heap', 'awesome', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'well', 'acted', 'heap', 'sloppy', 'Year', 'Living', 'Dangerously', 'seemed', 'squander', 'potential', 'predictable', 'love', 'story', 'yet', 'personal', 'Best', 'Picture', 'ballot', 'odd', 'mix', 'films', 'never', 'expected', 'remotely', 'enjoy', 'have', 'foreign', 'language', 'family', 'drama', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'ok', 'really', 'expected', 'slobber', 'Fanny', 'Alexander', 'did', 'engaging', 'provoking', 'collection', 'home', 'movies', 'Sans', 'Soleil', 'just', 'utterly', 'astonishing', 'conclusion', 'George', 'Lucas', 'science', 'fiction', 'epic', 'say', 'what', 'will', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'just', 'as', 'perfect', 'previous', 'two', 'efforts', 'were', 'comedy', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'King', 'Comedy', 'changed', 'way', 'looked', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'director', 'BRILLIANT', 'faux-documentary', 'Woody', 'Allen.Narrated', 'Patrick', 'Horgan', 'true', 'documented', 'fashion', 'Zelig', 'story', 'Leonard', 'Zelig', 'man', 'strange', 'social', 'disease', 'change', 'physical', 'emotional', 'makeup', 'order', 'adapt', 'surroundings', 'speak', 'patterns', 'life', 'story', 'physical', 'appearance', 'order', 'blend', 'surroundings', 'Dr.', 'Eudora', 'Nesbitt', 'Fletcher', 'obsessed', 'uncovering', 'reasons', 'Zelig', 'condition', 'recorded', 'sessions', 'learn', 'uncomfortable', 'situation', 'where', 'Zelig', 'asked', 'read', 'popular', 'novel', 'only', 'lie', 'escape', 'embarrassment', 'thus', 'initiating', 'conformity.For', 'film', 'strongly', 'two', 'subjects', 'instinctive', 'desire', 'fit', 'instinctive', 'desire', 'shun', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Zelig', 'be', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'uncontrollably', 'surroundings', 'result', 'shunned', 'even', 'greater', 'outcast', 'who', 'uncover', 'strange', 'ever', 'coming', 'preachy', 'saccharine', 'not', 'SLIGHTEST', 'Zelig', 'tells', 'okay', 'be', 'different', 'better', 'be', 'okay', 'accept', 'something', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand.Woody', 'Allen', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'are', 'great', 'here', 'perfectly', 'adapting', 'films', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'really', 'classify', 'acting', 'really', 'appear', 'series', 'photographs', 'are', 'altered', 'flawlessly', 'few', 'scattered', 'clips', 'effortless', 'quality', 'work', 'here', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'commendable', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'direction', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'so', 'genuine', 'authentic', 'would', 'swear', 'were', 'watching', 'real', 'documentary.It', 'astonishing', 'truly.I', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'documentary', 'am', 'always', 'fascinated', 'BBC', 'documentaries', 'are', 'so', 'bizarre', 'know', 'not', 'documentary', 'literal', 'sense', 'purely', 'fiction', 'film', 'documentary', 'most', 'engrossing', 'kind', 'worth', 'noting', 'NOT', 'mockumentary', 'parody', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'very', 'serious', 'film', 'comical', 'qualities', 'should', 'be', 'regarded', 'such', 'applaud', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'quite', 'did']",N/A

670922,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00005O06N,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[2, 3]","`Zelig', written and directed by Woody Allen, is a truly, truly odd and unusual film, even for Woody. On the surface, it is very similar to some of the early Woodman films like `Bananas' and `Sleeper', yet it was made after the very important `Annie Hall' and `Manhattan', which marked a change in Allen's movies toward a much stronger concern with characters and story.One is almost inclined to describe this as a science fiction movie, the classic characterization of which is to set up a hypothesis of `lets imagine such and such is true' and lets see what comes of it. While the classic hypotheses of classic sci-fi are time travel, faster than light travel, colonization of other planets, alien intelligences, and unusual human and artificial intelligences and powers, `Zellig' simply hypothesizes a person who can change to fit the appearance and speech of those in whose company he happens to be. This ability is not limited to normal abilities of impersonators such as Rich Little. This includes changing skin color, gaining or loosing weight, and changing facial features.All this could easily devolve into a convenient situation for making jokes, and there are jokes aplenty based on this odd premise, yet you still develop sympathy for Leonard Zellig, played by Allen, and his young psychiatrist, played by Mia Farrow. In fact, the acting by Farrow may be some of her very best in bringing this really bizarre material to life.While my experience with watching movies is pretty broad, it is not exactly encyclopedic, so I am really hard pressed to think of any movie with which this film has any affinity whatsoever. The interspersed interviews with real, notable intellectuals such as Susan Sontag, Saul Bellow and Irving Howe are similar to interviews done in `Reds', the Warren Beatty work on the American journalist who covered the Russian revolution. It may be total coincidence, but this movie also stars former Allen costar Diane Keaton, so I'm thinking some cross-pollination may be going on here. This failure to find an exemplar that Allen is parodying is also strongly against form. Almost half of his movies that are not set in Manhattan are parodies of some other genre. I simply cannot imagine what genre Allen is playing against with this film.While Allen is not adverse to very large casts (See `Annie Hall', for example), he is typically not big on tricky special effects and photography, yet this movie is a major essay in very subtle, yet very good special effects which place Allen and Farrow into documentary films of New York parades, 1920's jazz performances, and films of Adolf Hitler in Germany. And, this is all done with only a few additions to his most familiar collaborators such as cinematographer Gordon Willis and editor Susan Morse. He does bring in an important composer to do new songs to simulate some early thirties popular music written to celebrate the popular `chameleon' Zelig'.While one may ultimately not warm to the improbability of the situation, this movie is probably a landmark in Allen's body of work, staking out a direction and genre that few other filmmakers would take on. Remarkably, in the same work, Allen remains true to the reality of human frailties with his stock company of collaborators while creating an essay in filmmaking that rivals some of the more unusual films of the last century.Like most Allen movies, I give it high marks for rewatchability, even if you must stretch just a bit to appreciate the unusual premise. The consolidation is that there are probably more jokes per segment than any of his films since `Annie Hall'.",5,Allen Parodies Documentaries.

The film is a mockumentary about the life and times of Leonard Zelig, a man who has the psychological ability to transform and blend himself to meet the traits of those who surround him. Dr. Eudora Fletcher slowly molds Zelig into a functioning, free-thinking member of society, the irony being that society loses interest in him and grow to hate him. The film approaches the subject of conformity in a very unique way. It suggests the true independence is inattainable because Zelig is a conformist when he transforms himself yet he is also a conformist when he attempts to be an average schmo. The film also satirizes the hypocrisy of man and his ability to have such rapid change in opinion and feeling towards a fellow human being. Zelig goes from being loved and idolized, to being neutral in the public's eye, to being despised by all and then back to being praised at the end. From a technical standpoint, the film is innovative. Allen pioneered a technique in which he could impose his and Mia Farrow's likeness into footage pre-dating the Second World War, a technique later used in Forrest Gump. Essentially, on all fronts, Zelig is brilliant and possibly the earliest example of a mockumentary, being released one year prior to Rob Reiner's This is Spinal Tap.",5,Zelig,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,1397,"['thought-provoking', 'wildly', 'inventive', 'often', 'hysterical', 'work', 'satire', 'could', 'only', 'come', 'mind', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'mockumentary', 'life', 'times', 'Leonard', 'Zelig', 'man', 'who', 'psychological', 'ability', 'transform', 'blend', 'meet', 'traits', 'who', 'surround', 'Dr.', 'Eudora', 'Fletcher', 'slowly', 'Zelig', 'functioning', 'free-thinking', 'member', 'society', 'irony', 'being', 'society', 'interest', 'grow', 'hate', 'film', 'subject', 'conformity', 'very', 'unique', 'way', 'true', 'independence', 'inattainable', 'Zelig', 'conformist', 'when', 'yet', 'also', 'conformist', 'when', 'be', 'average', 'schmo', 'film', 'also', 'hypocrisy', 'man', 'ability', 'have', 'such', 'rapid', 'change', 'opinion', 'feeling', 'towards', 'fellow', 'human', 'being', 'Zelig', 'being', 'loved', 'idolized', 'being', 'neutral', 'public', 'eye', 'being', 'despised', 'then', 'back', 'being', 'praised', 'end', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'film', 'innovative', 'Allen', 'pioneered', 'technique', 'could', 'impose', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'likeness', 'footage', 'pre-dating', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'technique', 'later', 'used', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Essentially', 'fronts', 'Zelig', 'brilliant', 'possibly', 'earliest', 'example', 'mockumentary', 'being', 'released', 'one', 'year', 'prior', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Spinal', 'Tap']",N/A
670930,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,B00005O06N,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[0, 1]","While seconding the five star reviews here, I must ask you please to permit me to suggest you view this film in a double feature withBroadway Danny Roseto see the spectrum of Farrow's collaboration with Mr. Allen. I confess I have not seen their later filmHannah and Her Sisters, but hear that also reflects the evolution of their somewhat fruitful relationship, although after its ultimate and excruciating tragic ending in litigation and merciless custody battles.In any case, kindly view this film in relationship with Broadway Danny Rose. Both Farrow and Allen remain in view almost constantly throughout both films, and yet we might call Rose Allen's film, as she remains hidden behind a stone face and large dark glasses as a gun moll throughout, until her ultimate catharsis, delivered with the same statuesque face while Allen shows his chops extremely well (her few deviations from the hard character might be when her glasses fall during the hilarious wriggling scene, and when he praises her jungle concept for interior decoration, the first to do so, at which point she grows visibly vulnerable and the ice maiden for one instant melts).But we have not come to praise Danny Rose but to bury him. This here is clearly Farrow's movie, and displays brilliantly the full spectrum of her acting ability. It is very real, and very good. Check her character's quick peeks at her brother's camera when the hypnotized Zelig admits her wants to go to bed with her. Check her constant humility and strong perseverance amongst the really off the wall medical experts, all male, at a time when it was nearly impossible for a woman to be accepted as a peer in the psychiatric profession.Allen does the best he can with a difficult character, letting the wardrobe do the acting and playing a real jerk who cannot just relax and be himself, and when he does only offends. His character is not designed to be very likeable; Allen has given a great prize however to Farrow with this role, which when seen in a double feature with BDR as mentioned above, really makes you appreciate her perhaps for the first time as a gifted and intelligent actor.It is a great tragedy for our cinema these two very gifted and talented and creative people could not negotiate a longer artisitc life together than these two retro black and white films. Neither would hit these heights again, not for all theSmall Time CrooksorThe Purple Rose of CairoorThe Curse of the Jade Scorpionor can watch; you might as well give up and get outTake the Money and Run - Uncut (Widescreen Edition), another example of a Woody Allen mock-documentary delivered in the nicotine stained, earnest voice of a late fifties announcer, and have a good laugh.Meanwhile, please forgive this meditation on the Tragedy of Farrow and Allen. Zelig is marvelous and subtle. Like James Joyce's Nausicaa episode inUlysses (Gabler Edition), it takes awhile to remember you are experiencing a parody, a brilliant parody faithful to the form while mocking its superficiality and inevitably erroneous nature. In fact it is so faithful to the form that the narrating voice cannot be replaced; the narrator is an essential actor in this tale, as is the chorus of narrators who take over James JOyce's Ulysses, and thus you will not find here a French or Spanish soundtrack as on other Allen films, but only subtitles, reasonably well done.Of the two I prefer Broadway Danny Rose with its evangelical message of Acceptance, Forgiveness and Love (as Rose continually repeats: ""without meaning to be didatic nor facetious""). This film explicitly states that Zelig's conformism inevitably leads to totalitarian fascism, and this also is a message we must never forget.I wish that Farrow and Allen might have been permitted to accept, forgive and to love, and to continue producing great cinema, the only ones apparently that Allen put all of his great and compassionate heart and considerable and serious mind into, yet let's be thankful we have these two, and see them again.Play It Again, Sam.",5,Mia Farrow's finest,1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,4030,"['seconding', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'here', 'must', 'ask', 'please', 'permit', 'suggest', 'view', 'film', 'double', 'feature', 'withBroadway', 'Danny', 'Roseto', 'see', 'spectrum', 'Farrow', 'collaboration', 'Mr.', 'Allen', 'confess', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'later', 'filmHannah', 'Her', 'Sisters', 'hear', 'also', 'evolution', 'somewhat', 'fruitful', 'relationship', 'ultimate', 'excruciating', 'tragic', 'ending', 'litigation', 'merciless', 'custody', 'case', 'kindly', 'view', 'film', 'relationship', 'Broadway', 'Danny', 'Rose', 'Farrow', 'Allen', 'remain', 'view', 'almost', 'constantly', 'films', 'yet', 'might', 'call', 'Rose', 'Allen', 'film', 'hidden', 'stone', 'face', 'large', 'dark', 'glasses', 'gun', 'moll', 'ultimate', 'catharsis', 'delivered', 'same', 'statuesque', 'face', 'Allen', 'chops', 'extremely', 'well', 'few', 'deviations', 'hard', 'character', 'might', 'be', 'when', 'glasses', 'fall', 'hilarious', 'wriggling', 'scene', 'when', 'jungle', 'concept', 'interior', 'decoration', 'first', 'do', 'so', 'point', 'visibly', 'vulnerable', 'ice', 'maiden', 'one', 'instant', 'melts', '.But', 'have', 'not', 'come', 'praise', 'Danny', 'Rose', 'bury', 'here', 'clearly', 'Farrow', 'movie', 'displays', 'brilliantly', 'full', 'spectrum', 'acting', 'ability', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'good', 'Check', 'character', 'quick', 'peeks', 'brother', 'camera', 'when', 'hypnotized', 'Zelig', 'go', 'bed', 'Check', 'constant', 'humility', 'strong', 'perseverance', 'really', 'wall', 'medical', 'experts', 'male', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'woman', 'be', 'accepted', 'peer', 'psychiatric', 'profession.Allen', 'best', 'can', 'difficult', 'character', 'letting', 'wardrobe', 'do', 'acting', 'playing', 'real', 'jerk', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'just', 'relax', 'be', 'when', 'only', 'character', 'not', 'designed', 'be', 'very', 'likeable', 'Allen', 'given', 'great', 'prize', 'however', 'Farrow', 'role', 'when', 'seen', 'double', 'feature', 'BDR', 'mentioned', 'really', 'appreciate', 'perhaps', 'first', 'time', 'gifted', 'intelligent', 'actor.It', 'great', 'tragedy', 'cinema', 'two', 'very', 'gifted', 'talented', 'creative', 'people', 'could', 'not', 'negotiate', 'longer', 'artisitc', 'life', 'together', 'two', 'retro', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'would', 'hit', 'heights', 'again', 'not', 'theSmall', 'Time', 'CrooksorThe', 'Purple', 'Rose', 'CairoorThe', 'Curse', 'Jade', 'Scorpionor', 'can', 'watch', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'give', 'up', 'get', 'outTake', 'Money', 'Run', 'Uncut', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'example', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'mock-documentary', 'delivered', 'nicotine', 'stained', 'earnest', 'voice', 'late', 'fifties', 'announcer', 'have', 'good', 'laugh.Meanwhile', 'please', 'forgive', 'meditation', 'Tragedy', 'Farrow', 'Allen', 'Zelig', 'marvelous', 'subtle', 'James', 'Joyce', 'Nausicaa', 'episode', 'inUlysses', 'Gabler', 'Edition', 'remember', 'are', 'experiencing', 'parody', 'brilliant', 'parody', 'faithful', 'form', 'mocking', 'superficiality', 'inevitably', 'erroneous', 'nature', 'fact', 'so', 'faithful', 'form', 'narrating', 'voice', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'replaced', 'narrator', 'essential', 'actor', 'tale', 'chorus', 'narrators', 'who', 'take', 'over', 'James', 'JOyce', 'Ulysses', 'thus', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'here', 'French', 'Spanish', 'soundtrack', 'other', 'Allen', 'films', 'only', 'subtitles', 'reasonably', 'well', 'done.Of', 'two', 'prefer', 'Broadway', 'Danny', 'Rose', 'evangelical', 'message', 'Acceptance', 'Forgiveness', 'Love', 'Rose', 'continually', 'meaning', 'be', 'didatic', 'facetious', 'film', 'explicitly', 'Zelig', 'conformism', 'inevitably', 'totalitarian', 'fascism', 'also', 'message', 'must', 'never', 'forget.I', 'wish', 'Farrow', 'Allen', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'permitted', 'accept', 'forgive', 'love', 'continue', 'producing', 'great', 'cinema', 'only', 'ones', 'apparently', 'Allen', 'put', 'great', 'compassionate', 'heart', 'considerable', 'serious', 'mind', 'let', 'be', 'thankful', 'have', 'two', 'see', 'again.Play', 'Again', 'Sam']",N/A

670934,A308X3FITWLF7W,B00005O06N,"Elvin Ortiz ""CurlyAl34""","[1, 1]","Imitating the documentary form, this film portrays the life of Zelig, a person who has the innate capacity to physically transform himself into any other kind of person only by standing next to him. He can convert into a black person, a Chinese, a baseball player, jazz player, or a rabbi, etc. Once he gets interned into a psychiatric hospital, Dr. Eudora Fletcher begins to study him and becomes passionately involved in trying to cure her patient. Eventually they fall in love and plan to marry. This sets off another crisis where Zelig turns out to have married and impregnated many women during his earlier existence as the human chameleon. This new crisis leads Zelig to become a Nazi, but he is rescued on time by Dr. Fletcher.While done mostly in black and white footage, the film looks like a real documentary. Yet, the film's narrative is hilarious and ironic. Every comment made through the film is meant for laughs although Allen uses its content to reflect about the conformism of popular culture. For this reason, he may have decided to use the 1920s as the historical backdrop for this film. The special effects are astonishing as we see Allen together with Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover, or standing behind Babe Ruth while the latter is at bat during a Yankees game. There are some interviews with Susan Sontag, Saul Bellow, and other real contemporary people playing themselves, and who speak as if they were scholars who had studied the Zelig phenomenon.Allen pursues the theme of the conformism of popular culture that he began in Annie Hall (1977). This time he does it through this Zelig character who desperately wants to blend in, he wants to feel accepted by others, and therefore conforms to his environs to the point of developing chameleonic tendencies. At the same time, the film doesn't forget to make fun of documentaries based on psychiatric studies, using the character of Eudora Fletcher as a parody of psychiatry. I liked this film, not only because of its unique way of narrating a story, but mostly because the narrative was really funny and because I can relate, and I think many people can, to the Zelig character in his quest to be accepted by others, to blend into the dominant group. Although every human being goes through this process, Allen really warns us against the pervasiveness of popular culture that often makes us behave in ways that only reflect are desire to be part of the group.

His skin turns black when he is with the Black people, with the Native Americans, he became one; attending the dinner with the intellectuals, he speaks brilliantly with F.S. Fitzgerald, when on the baseball field, he is Babe Ruth. The meeting with an intelligent and compassionate psychiatrist, Dr. Eudora Fletcher (Mia Farrow) will begin the slow and long process for Zelig of searching and finding his own personality and possibility for love and happiness. The movie provides laughs and smiles but it also makes the viewer think of more serious subjects. Are we all have a Zelig inside? Don't we all want to be liked and try to adapt to our surroundings to feel comfortable? The movie can also be viewed as the meditation on the nature of the acting ability. While watching ""Zelig"", I kept thinking of a book I read recently. One of the characters was a great actor who had the similar to Zelig's disorder - he had no personality at all until he was given a part to act on stage. That Actor made the best and most convincing and complex Shakespeare's heroes - he was a brilliant reflective Hamlet but his greatest success was tragic Othello. The actor's transformation to Othello was so real that he acted it at home with his wife whom he suspected in cheating - he played his role perfectly with the same as in the play results. He ended up in the asylum where he could not act but he was allowed to read...Dostoevsky's novel ""The Possessed"" from which he chose to adapt the personality of Nikolai Stavrogin with rather unpredictable results. When his doctor finally realized what happened, he took all books with the exception of ""The Idiot"". Finally, the actor became a gentle and kind Prinz Myshkin, and that was the end of book.Both, the book and the movie ""Zelig"" made me think of the price the artists pay to achieve perfection in their art. Are they vampires sucking the life out of their victims only to use them as characters for their acting roles? Is that the ultimate price the artist is paying for being a great artist? Does he need lives and souls of others to be able to create? This is one of many subjects ""Zelig"" makes you think about.Allen seamlessly weds Black and white newsreel footage with his humorous but deep and fascinating tale allowing Zelig to be exactly where and when History was made. Using special lenses to give the movie the old style, mixing his own footage with the real documentaries, including his favorite music, dances, feeling perfectly forever gone era, Woody recreates The Roaring 20Th with breathtaking authenticity.According to my new grading system, MIWIHSIIT, a Masterpiece, I wish I had seen in the theater",5,"""Identity Crisis and Its Relationship to Personality Disorder """,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,3429,"['One', 'most', 'sophisticated', 'cleverest', 'funniest', 'exquisitely', 'shot', 'edited', 'scored', 'acted', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'Zelig', 'masterpiece', 'astounding', 'work', 'even', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'mediocre', 'movies', 'are', 'way', 'regular', 'Hollywood', 'fares.With', 'modest', 'running', 'time', 'less', '80', 'minutes', 'mockumentary', 'story', 'human', 'chameleon', 'Leonard', 'Zelig', 'Leonard', 'Lizard', 'who', 'possessed', 'extraordinary', 'ability', 'transform', 'anyone', 'met', 'should', 'say', 'extraordinary', 'ability', 'possessed', '.Leonard', 'shy', 'little', 'meek', 'Jewish', 'man', 'rare', 'personality', 'disorder', 'not', 'having', 'own', 'personality', 'successfully', 'effortlessly', 'adapting', 'personality', 'came', 'close', 'fitting', 'perfectly', 'surroundings', 'skin', 'black', 'when', 'Black', 'people', 'Native', 'Americans', 'became', 'one', 'attending', 'dinner', 'intellectuals', 'brilliantly', 'F.S', 'Fitzgerald', 'when', 'baseball', 'field', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'meeting', 'intelligent', 'compassionate', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Eudora', 'Fletcher', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'will', 'begin', 'slow', 'long', 'process', 'Zelig', 'searching', 'finding', 'own', 'personality', 'possibility', 'love', 'happiness', 'movie', 'laughs', 'smiles', 'also', 'viewer', 'think', 'more', 'serious', 'subjects', 'Are', 'have', 'Zelig', 'inside', 'Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'liked', 'try', 'adapt', 'surroundings', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'movie', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'viewed', 'meditation', 'nature', 'acting', 'ability', 'watching', 'Zelig', 'kept', 'thinking', 'book', 'read', 'recently', 'One', 'characters', 'was', 'great', 'actor', 'who', 'had', 'similar', 'Zelig', 'disorder', 'had', 'personality', 'was', 'given', 'part', 'act', 'stage', 'Actor', 'made', 'best', 'most', 'convincing', 'complex', 'Shakespeare', 'heroes', 'was', 'brilliant', 'reflective', 'Hamlet', 'greatest', 'success', 'was', 'tragic', 'Othello', 'actor', 'transformation', 'Othello', 'was', 'so', 'real', 'acted', 'home', 'wife', 'whom', 'suspected', 'cheating', 'played', 'role', 'perfectly', 'same', 'play', 'results', 'ended', 'up', 'asylum', 'where', 'could', 'not', 'act', 'was', 'allowed', 'read', 'Dostoevsky', 'novel', 'Possessed', 'chose', 'adapt', 'personality', 'Nikolai', 'Stavrogin', 'rather', 'unpredictable', 'results', 'When', 'doctor', 'finally', 'realized', 'what', 'happened', 'took', 'books', 'exception', 'Idiot', 'Finally', 'actor', 'became', 'gentle', 'kind', 'Prinz', 'Myshkin', 'was', 'end', 'book.Both', 'book', 'movie', 'Zelig', 'made', 'think', 'price', 'artists', 'pay', 'achieve', 'perfection', 'art', 'Are', 'vampires', 'sucking', 'life', 'victims', 'only', 'use', 'characters', 'acting', 'roles', 'ultimate', 'price', 'artist', 'paying', 'being', 'great', 'artist', 'need', 'lives', 'souls', 'others', 'be', 'able', 'create', 'one', 'many', 'subjects', 'Zelig', 'think', 'about.Allen', 'seamlessly', 'weds', 'Black', 'white', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'humorous', 'deep', 'fascinating', 'tale', 'allowing', 'Zelig', 'be', 'exactly', 'where', 'when', 'History', 'was', 'made', 'Using', 'special', 'lenses', 'give', 'movie', 'old', 'style', 'mixing', 'own', 'footage', 'real', 'documentaries', 'including', 'favorite', 'music', 'dances', 'feeling', 'perfectly', 'forever', 'gone', 'era', 'Woody', 'Roaring', '20Th', 'breathtaking', 'authenticity.According', 'new', 'grading', 'system', 'MIWIHSIIT', 'Masterpiece', 'wish', 'had', 'seen', 'theater']",N/A

Some people might find the pace a bit slow, and the humor a bit dry, precisely because it is presented exactly as it would be if it were an actual serious documentary about a real historical personage.  It requires a bit more thought and attention on the part of the vewer than does a ""conventional"" comedy for that reason.  At one point the narrator, in his best, serious, Public Television Documentary National Geographic Special voice, describes Zelig's parents and their violent domestic squabbles: ""...Even though they lived over a bowling alley, it was the bowling alley that complained about the noise.""  This sort of thing could go right past you if you weren't really listening.The reason this film works is that all of the supporting details are meticulous and perfect.  All of the 1920's songs about Zelig (such as ""The Chameleon Dance"" and ""You May Be Six People, But I Love You"") are written and performed so perfectly in period style that I, watching it the first few times, could hardly believe that they were not actual, real (but obscure) 1920's songs that they found somewhere which happened to fit the movie theme, rather than being modern parodies of vintage recordings.  (Speaking as a musician, I can vouch for the fact that that bright, Irish popular tenor sound which was all the rage back then is a rarity these days!)And all of the film clips are just as carefully executed. I seem to remember, back when this film was just out, an article describing how Allen's production staff took just-shot black and white footage into the parking lot and threw it on the ground and walked all over it, and carefully crinkled the film, so that it would look worn and decades-old.  Another tour-de-force was inserting Allen himself, playing the title character, into REAL period footage.  The most famous example is a film of Hitler ranting away to a crowd on his Nazi platform, and seated behind him among all of the party officials is... Zelig.  This was an amazing technical achievement at the time, long before digital cinematography had become commonplace, and it was brilliantly done.And then of course, there are all of the present-day intellectual luminary talking heads being interviewed for their two cents, again, just like a true documentary.  One that comes to mind of course is the (now late) Susan Sontag.  I am sure that all of those ""experts"" had lots of fun filming this.The subject of the documentary, Zelig, has an unusual mental/physical affliction due to insecurity.  He literally, and physically, becomes just like whoever he is with, in order to blend in and be accepted.  This offers the opportunity for plenty of sight gags as Zelig turns into different cultures, occupations, and races -- sometimes more than one at once!  He is alternately exploited as a circus freak for profit, and attempted to be cured by his caring psychiatrist. He is alternately proclaimed a hero, a villain, a traitor, and a hero again by a fickle public.  Zelig's exchanges with his psychiatrist are some of the funniest dialogue in the film.  When she finally manages to get Zelig under hypnosis so that she can find out what the true, non-chameleon person inside really thinks, he launches into a (dreamy, trance-voiced) tirade about her awful cooking.  I still joke with my wife to this day about her ""terrible pancakes.""  [grin]Those who are Woody Allen fans in general will of course probably enjoy this; people who like subtle wit and parody generally will probably enjoy this; people who habitually overdose on PBS and The History Channel but still have enough sense of humor left to laugh at themselves will probably enjoy this.  If you prefer jokes with punchlines, or ""Gilligan, drop those coconuts!"" then Zelig is probably one to avoid.And might I add in parting:  If you have not yet read Moby Dick, don't wait until it is too late!",5,"""Your pancakes...

670943,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005O06N,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 1]","This 1983-mockumentary from director Woody Allen is one of his most fascinating, unique films. Allen portrays Leonard Zelig, a human chameleon who frequently appears during the course of history. The term chameleon never clicked with me while reading synopsis' of this film, but Zelig is quite literally a chameleon, having the ability to transform into people he's around making it easy to fit in with anyone; black, Jewish, doctors, etc. The plot, told with ""old,"" narrated footage of Zelig and intercut with present-day ""interviews,"" follows Zelig as he gains national attention for his remarkable ability. Doctors are baffled and eventually find themselves giving up on Zelig, with the exception of Dr. Eudora Fletcher (Mia Farrow), who thinks she can help him.Allen incorporates himself into actual, historical footage throughout the film (the funniest being one involving Hitler) and he does it seamlessly. Considering Allen didn't have the digital technology of today, it's impressive how effortlessly and perfectly he had himself weaved into this pre-existing footage. Equally impressive though are the scenes filmed specifically for the film, which look and feel exactly like footage from the era. While the film sounds like it's driven by a gimmick, Allen never lets you in on the fact that it is a gimmick `cause every shot, every song just feels right.The film blends Allen's filmmaking styles, with both his witty, subtle humor and some dramatic elements. While it's not exactly more ""accessible"" than other Allen films, it's experimental nature will appeal to non-Allen fans. There are films that share similar themes and attributes with Zelig, but it's one of Allen's most original films.Overall, it's a fascinating and amusing entry in Allen's filmography. At only 71 minutes, Woody Allen gives us one of his most memorable creations. I don't think it's a perfect film, but it's so good that the bad isn't worth mentioning.GRADE: A-",5,"A Unique, Original Film by Woody Allen",1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,1948,"['1983-mockumentary', 'director', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'unique', 'films', 'Allen', 'Leonard', 'Zelig', 'human', 'chameleon', 'who', 'frequently', 'course', 'history', 'term', 'chameleon', 'never', 'clicked', 'reading', 'synopsis', 'film', 'Zelig', 'quite', 'literally', 'chameleon', 'having', 'ability', 'transform', 'people', 'making', 'easy', 'fit', 'anyone', 'black', 'Jewish', 'doctors', 'etc', 'plot', 'told', 'old', 'narrated', 'footage', 'Zelig', 'intercut', 'present-day', 'interviews', 'Zelig', 'gains', 'national', 'attention', 'remarkable', 'ability', 'Doctors', 'are', 'baffled', 'eventually', 'find', 'giving', 'up', 'Zelig', 'exception', 'Dr.', 'Eudora', 'Fletcher', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'him.Allen', 'actual', 'historical', 'footage', 'film', 'funniest', 'being', 'one', 'involving', 'Hitler', 'seamlessly', 'Considering', 'Allen', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'digital', 'technology', 'today', 'impressive', 'how', 'effortlessly', 'perfectly', 'had', 'weaved', 'pre-existing', 'footage', 'Equally', 'impressive', 'though', 'are', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'specifically', 'film', 'look', 'feel', 'exactly', 'footage', 'era', 'film', 'driven', 'gimmick', 'Allen', 'never', 'fact', 'gimmick', 'cause', 'shot', 'song', 'just', 'right.The', 'film', 'Allen', 'filmmaking', 'styles', 'witty', 'subtle', 'humor', 'dramatic', 'elements', 'not', 'exactly', 'more', 'accessible', 'other', 'Allen', 'films', 'experimental', 'nature', 'will', 'appeal', 'non-Allen', 'fans', 'are', 'films', 'share', 'similar', 'themes', 'Zelig', 'one', 'Allen', 'most', 'original', 'films.Overall', 'fascinating', 'amusing', 'entry', 'Allen', 'filmography', 'only', '71', 'minutes', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'creations', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'perfect', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'bad', ""n't"", 'worth', 'mentioning.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

The film is made in black and white and is set in the 1920- 30's .The genre would be  mocumentary . Narrated by Patrick Horgan ( whose voice/Brit accent is absolutely perfect ). In the film Woody inserts himself into old film footage with historical figures like Calvin Coolidge ,Babe Ruth and Hitler. Zelig was released 11 years before Forrest Gump and whoever came up with the idea for Gump certainly saw Zelig - more than once.What makes Zelig so great is that it's so well done that if you happened to be flicking through the channels and you tuned into this ( didn't know who Woody Allen was )you might actually think there was an actual Leonard Zelig in the forgotten annals of history  ..that's how well done it is .Zelig is far from Woody Allen's funniest film ..but it does have it's moments . It's the incredible detail , the straight voiced narration that make Zelig a work of art ..If you're looking for Play It Again Sam or Bananas or even Annie Hall - it's none of those .

670951,A1BVCH82W0M2W2,B00005O06N,"Paul Tognetti ""The real world is so much more...","[1, 1]","I have never seen quite anything like it. When Woody Allen's 1983 film ""Zelig"" was released it was dubbed a ""mockumentary"".  ""Zelig"" stars Woody Allen as a curious little man called Leonard Zelig who seems to turn up with surprising or unaccountable frequency in a variety of settings.  Zelig possesses the uncanny ability to look and act like whoever happens to be around him.  One minute he is seen looking like a white major league baseball player and the next time you spot him he might resemble a black jazz musicion.  Zelig was a media sensation during The Roaring '20s and was dubbed ""the human chameleon"".  When Leonard Zelig first appears on the scene a young psychologist named Eudora Fletcher (Mia Farrow) takes an interest in his case and vows to help him in any way she can.  She quickly determines her patient is only yearning for the approval of others which is why he physically changes to fit in with those around him.  It is a bizarre condition the likes of which has been seen before but Dr. Fletcher honestly believes that she can help cure him of this malady.  The trials and tribulations of Leonard Zelig and Dr. Eudora Fletcher are chronicled in the film.  What makes this film so unique is that it was shot in the style of those primitive 1920's black and white newsreels that were so popular back in the day.  Allen, who also wrote and directed this film, cleverly weaves stock footage from the period into the story.  Patrick Horgan who narrates the ""mockumentary"" is just perfect and greatly adds to the ambiance of this film.  Meanwhile, Allen adds contemporary commentary (filmed in color circa 1983 when the film was made) on all of these events from a number of the leading intellectuals of the day including such notables as Susan Sonntag,  Irving Howe and Saul Bellow.  A vintage Woody Allen technique!With all of the hoopla surrounding Leonard Zelig there is really only one person who truly cares about him.  Zelig was under observation by Dr. Fletcher when his half-sister Ruth and her shady husband Martin Geist show up to claim custody of Zelig.  Ruth and Martin want control of Zelig for one reason only....to exploit him for financial gain.  They turn Leonard into a carnival attraction, a novelty, a freak if you will.  They not only charge admission to see him but offer all kinds of merchandise to boot.  There are Zelig dolls, clocks, toys and books.  He truly is a worldwide phenomenon.  Zelig's popularity even spawns a dance craze known as ""The Chameleon"".  With no around to love him Leonard's condition continues to deteriorate.  Eventually, he vanishes from the scene and Dr. Fletcher is frantic to find him.  Some time later she spots him in a newsreel standing right behind of all people Adolf Hitler looking like an SS officer.  She rushes to Germany and manages to bring him home for treatment.  Eventually the two of them fall in love and are married.  Still, there are more peaks and valleys to come.So just how did Woody Allen go about making such an innovative film?  ""I wrote the whole script first,"" explains the filmmaker, ""then I looked at millions of feet of documentary and I changed my script with the new discoveries.  And this went on for a couple of years"".  Allen also went out of his way to find old cameras, lenses and sound equipment  from the 1920's to help give his film the authentic look and feel he was after.  The film also features several original new tunes recorded in the 1920's style including ""Chameleon Days"",  ""You May Be Six People But I Love You"",  ""Leonard The Lizard"" and ""Reptile Eyes"".  Very clever indeed!I viewed ""Zelig"" for the first time in a good many years the other day and found it to be every bit as engaging, charming and witty as I remembered it to be.  This is one of the most unique films you will ever see and ranks at or near the top of my favorite Woody Allen movies.  If you have never seen ""Zelig"" I urge you to give it a look-see.  You are in for a real treat.

670952,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B00005O06N,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[1, 1]","I've always had a soft spot for this beguilingly funny little Woody Allen film. 1983's ""Zelig"" casts Woody and Mia Farrow (his then-muse in his movies) as meek but chameolonic Leonard Zelig, whose bizarre personality changes cause him to astonishingly mimic anyone close, from doctors to politicians to ethnic minorities; and Farrow plays the plain-jane psychiatrist Eudora Fletcher, whose treatments of Zelig put her in headlines. Set against the carefree backdrop of the Roaring 20's, Fletcher takes on the difficult task of curing Zelig of his malady--and in a true Allen plot twist, both patient & doctor discover they're slowly falling in love.This predecessor to ""Forrest Gump"" is rightly so, as its theme parallels that of Gump: Allen's nebbish appearances in actual newsreel footage & photos are startling, as he hobnobs with F. Scott Fitzgerald and other historical figures, wandering through passages of history much like Gump. So obviously, this film relies heavily on technical slight-of-hand as Allen & Farrow are blended into visuals of the time.But in ""Zelig"", Allen seems to reconnect with his earlier films as his gift for the absurd takes over in everything from silly songs about Zelig ""the chameleon"" to merchandising to exploitation to treatments which hilariously backfire. The ultimate gag is near the end of the film, when Zelig comes out of one of his personalities during a Nazi rally while Hitler is talking..then fleeing Germany in a plane, assumes the skills of a pilot & flies the plane home to America--upside-down!It's Allen's gift as an actor that make Zelig strangely likeable--you really want to see this oddball have his happy ending.Again, an oddly-affecting documentary parody that will ultimately bring a smile to your face!",5,Woody's ever-changing mock documentary,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",2011,1763,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'soft', 'spot', 'beguilingly', 'funny', 'little', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', '1983', 'Zelig', 'Woody', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'then-muse', 'movies', 'meek', 'chameolonic', 'Leonard', 'Zelig', 'bizarre', 'personality', 'changes', 'cause', 'astonishingly', 'mimic', 'anyone', 'close', 'doctors', 'politicians', 'ethnic', 'minorities', 'Farrow', 'plain-jane', 'psychiatrist', 'Eudora', 'Fletcher', 'treatments', 'Zelig', 'put', 'headlines', 'Set', 'carefree', 'backdrop', 'Roaring', '20', 'Fletcher', 'difficult', 'task', 'curing', 'Zelig', 'malady', 'true', 'Allen', 'plot', 'twist', 'patient', 'doctor', 'discover', ""'re"", 'slowly', 'falling', 'love.This', 'predecessor', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'rightly', 'so', 'theme', 'parallels', 'Gump', 'Allen', 'nebbish', 'appearances', 'actual', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'photos', 'are', 'startling', 'F.', 'Scott', 'Fitzgerald', 'other', 'historical', 'figures', 'wandering', 'passages', 'history', 'much', 'Gump', 'So', 'obviously', 'film', 'heavily', 'technical', 'slight-of-hand', 'Allen', 'Farrow', 'are', 'blended', 'visuals', 'time.But', 'Zelig', 'Allen', 'reconnect', 'earlier', 'films', 'gift', 'absurd', 'over', 'everything', 'silly', 'songs', 'Zelig', 'chameleon', 'merchandising', 'exploitation', 'treatments', 'hilariously', 'backfire', 'ultimate', 'gag', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Zelig', 'one', 'personalities', 'Nazi', 'rally', 'Hitler', 'talking..then', 'fleeing', 'Germany', 'plane', 'skills', 'pilot', 'plane', 'home', 'America', 'upside-down', 'Allen', 'gift', 'actor', 'make', 'Zelig', 'strangely', 'likeable', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'oddball', 'have', 'happy', 'ending.Again', 'oddly-affecting', 'documentary', 'parody', 'will', 'ultimately', 'bring', 'smile', 'face']",N/A

To be honest, my initial reaction was to wonder if I would be able to maintain interest throughout the whole movie.  As it turned out, that was no problem.""Zelig"" tells the story of an individual who developed an unexplainable ability to appear like the people of his surroundings.  It is presented in a documentary format and that format is amazingly well done.  I'm of the opinion that there was plenty of actual newsreel footage from the 1920's and '30's and there was also plenty of new film made to appear that it was from that era.  I was never that certain as to which was which because the cinematography was that well done.  The  retrospective interviews with present day theorists and aged contemporaries butressed the documentary nature of the film (as did the continuous narration).As the title character (played by Woody Allen) assumes more and more identities, we come to understand that his efforts to be like others leaves him with no identity of his own.  I understood Allen's message to be an expression of his frustration with the negative public reaction to his post-""Annie Hall"" movies.  He wasn't making the kinds of pictures everyone else was and his uniqueness was being dismissed.  I saw him making a statement that banality lacks meaning by satirizing someone who went out of his way to avoid being himself.

This is of course years after 1977's Annie Hall and so Woody Allen's comic talent was already established. Woody Allen's witty, intellectual humor is most prominent in this film which he directs as if it were a documentary. It's entirely in black and white, except for the contemporary scenes of interviewed characters, there is footage from the 20's, 30's and 40's, including footage of Adolph Hitler making a speech at a Nazi rally. Woody Allen plays Leonard Zelig, a shy, unassuming little man with an identity disorder. He cannot truly be himself because he becomes transformed into his surroundings. When he is around Jewish rabbis, he becomes Jewish, when he is around African-Americans, he becomes black, when he is around overweight people, he becomes fat, etc. This miracle of biology earned him the title of the Chameleon or ""The Changing Man"". Mia Farrow, who coincidentally was romantically linked with Woody Allen at this time in the 80's, plays the role of Zelig's love interest Dr. Eudora Fletcher. Eudora Fletcher takes a genuine interest in Zelig and examines him psychologically through hypnosis. The scenes of their sessions are extremely funny but then again so is much of this movie. Woody Allen is the first Forrest Gump, being as funny and awkward, at least 10 years before Tom Hanks did it in the 90's. Zelig is so loved that he is hob-nobbing with all the greats of the time- Charlie Chaplin, William Randalph Hearst, Fanny Brice, F. Scott Fitzegerald and Zelda, etc. The music for this movie is appropriately cartoonish and Charleston/Jazz Age style. There is one dance segment called The Chameleon and another with the voice of Betty Boop singing ""Chameleon Days"".

It is a one trick movie, though the conceit is fantastic: the idea of a man who changes his appearance, as well as his personna, to fit in with the varying company he finds himself in. Shot in grainy mock 1920s film with subtle and wickedly inventive special prosthetic effects, Leonard Zelig is a man who wants to fit in. He is noticed by Scott Fitzgerald at a house party, one moment hobnobbing with the social elite, the next a scruffy worker 'saying he was a democrat' amongst the serving staff. Amongst negroes - he is one! Obese people - he piles on the pounds accordingly. Zelig's chameleon ability to change his appearance to fit in earns him national fame as 'the lizard man', with an accompanying 1920s Charlestonesque dance, and a series of songs to celebrate his talent. Of course, freaks who find fame often pay a personal price, and Zelig becomes withdrawn and alienated. All he wanted to do was fit in, but he finds himself unloved and withdrawn from society.The beautiful psychiatrist, Eudora Flether (Mia Farrow) takes up Zelig's case, and sees an opportunity to make her name by investigating this phenomenon, and attempting to cure him Initially she is baffled by Zelig, but by turning the tables on him: 'I'm not really a doctor, I just pretend to be one because my friends are', she unravells the deception at the heart of Zelig's personality disorder, destabilising his mental state. Improbably (the second half of the movie is one improbable farce after another) the pair fall in love. Zelig disappears, and Fletcher searches the world to find him. She catches him, where? At a Nazi rally. Their eyes meet, interrupting Hitler 'telling a good joke about Poland' and their harebrained flight (literally) back to America ensues.The film is most noteworthy for its original premise and amusing prosthetic special effects. The level of humour is about a b-minus by Allen's standards, though it was fun to see the likes of Saul Bellow and Susan Sontag commenting on Zelig's life as if it were a real intellectual documentary.The idea of the social chameleon is an interesing one to investigate.

It a mockumentary about Leonard Zelig, a man whose features could change to look like whomever he is with at the time. It's a skilled comedy, with some impressive special effects scene (Woody Allen clowning around with Charlie Chaplin and Babe Ruth), along with some interesting stock footage, film parodies, and bizarre musical numbers. While the middle section of the film (focusing on Zelig's therapy) sags a bit, the rest of the film more than makes up for it.Being a Woody Allen film, there are very few frills on this, other than a booklet and a trailer (which shows quite well how unmarketable the movie was - hence the box office failure). The picture and sound are supposed to be rather scratchy, so there is very little that the DVD can do.",4,Clever Woody Allen Mockumentary,1046995200,"03 7, 2003",2003,840,"['quot', 'Zelig', 'quot', 'quite', 'probably', 'most', 'experimental', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'mockumentary', 'Leonard', 'Zelig', 'man', 'features', 'could', 'change', 'look', 'whomever', 'time', 'skilled', 'comedy', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'scene', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'clowning', 'around', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'interesting', 'stock', 'footage', 'film', 'parodies', 'bizarre', 'musical', 'numbers', 'middle', 'section', 'film', 'focusing', 'Zelig', 'therapy', 'bit', 'rest', 'film', 'more', 'up', 'it.Being', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'frills', 'other', 'booklet', 'trailer', 'quite', 'well', 'how', 'unmarketable', 'movie', 'was', 'hence', 'box', 'office', 'failure', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'rather', 'scratchy', 'very', 'little', 'DVD', 'can', 'do']",N/A
670958,A2VGV2WOEPDPRW,B00005O06N,The Curmudgeon,"[1, 1]","This film is often described as a mock documentary but it is really a parody of human nature, American culture, and especially celebrity culture.This movie was made in 1984 when many celebrities from the pre-war era were still around.  They were featured in documentaries where they were interviewed in color while their old films were shown in black and white.  Allen has used this format by doing a great job in mimicking old black and white newsreels like the ones we used see on Movietone News before the spread of television.  He also does a great job in mimicking the serious tone of a documentary.Allen mocks our cultural pressure to conform by creating a character from the Roaring Twenties who is so eager to belong that he has mutated into a person who adopts the physical traits of anyone he is near regardless of race, ethnicity, size, or anything else.  Once the newspapers learn of him he is labeled as being The Chameleon.He then becomes an instant celebrity sensation with countless products named after him.  There are hit sings about him and Hollywood makes a film about him.  A chameleon dance becomes popular.  But extremist groups hold massive demonstrations against him with the Communist Party claiming he is exploiting workers by holding up to five jobs at one time in his various chameleon states and the Ku Klux Klan claiming he is a triple threat because he can be Jewish, Negro, or (American)Indian.Meanwhile medical experts are stumped and a female psychiatrist, Dr. Fletcher, attempts to analyze Zelig.  But Zelig is dissatisfied being a celebrity and disappears.  He eventually ends up in the Vatican on a balcony with the Pope in St Peters since he has infiltrated his inner circle as a purported insider.  Nevertheless it is discovered that he is an imposter and a commotion occurs on the balcony while the Pope is addressing the gathered throng and Zelig is deported back to America.Dr. Fletcher now decides to concentrate solely on treating him at a country retreat.  Eventually she manages to cure him and a group of experts comes to verify the results.  One of them mentions that it is a nice day but Zelig is now so self-assured that he attacks the expert because he does not agree that it is a nice day.  Dr. Fletcher has gone too far.  Nevertheless, Zelig becomes a celebrity again but this time he is famous for being himself and gives motivational speeches around the country on being yourself.Next Zelig and the now also famous Dr. Fletcher announce their engagement.  However, a major scandal breaks out as various women appear to claim that Zelig married them while in one of his chameleon states.  He is accused of bigamy, adultery, and various other crimes.  The public turns against him, showing how easily it is manipulated to create heroes or villains.  The pressure gets to Zelig, he reverts to his chameleon state, and disappears again.Dr. Fletcher desperately searches for him and eventually thinks she sees him in the background of a newsreel featuring Hitler.  She travels to Germany and attends a rally where she sees that Zelig has become one of Hitler's inner circle.  He recognizes her, breaks out of his chameleon state, and they escape back to America.  Zelig is now a hero again and receives a ticker-tape parade in New York.  After that they get married and fade into obscurity so that a documentary is later necessary to educate the public about him.This movie also shows that apparently only Jews can make jokes about Hitler.  There is something similar today with linguistic apartheid where blacks can use the ""N"" word and even become celebrities doing so while whites face persecution and loss of livelihood, thereby being subject to a new discrimination.",5,ALLEN'S BEST MOVIE,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",2013,3722,"['film', 'often', 'described', 'mock', 'documentary', 'really', 'parody', 'human', 'nature', 'American', 'culture', 'especially', 'celebrity', 'culture.This', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1984', 'when', 'many', 'celebrities', 'pre-war', 'era', 'were', 'still', 'around', 'were', 'featured', 'documentaries', 'where', 'were', 'interviewed', 'color', 'old', 'films', 'were', 'shown', 'black', 'white', 'Allen', 'used', 'format', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'mimicking', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'newsreels', 'ones', 'used', 'see', 'Movietone', 'News', 'spread', 'television', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'mimicking', 'serious', 'tone', 'documentary.Allen', 'cultural', 'pressure', 'conform', 'creating', 'character', 'Roaring', 'Twenties', 'who', 'so', 'eager', 'belong', 'mutated', 'person', 'who', 'physical', 'traits', 'anyone', 'near', 'regardless', 'race', 'ethnicity', 'size', 'anything', 'else', 'newspapers', 'learn', 'labeled', 'being', 'Chameleon.He', 'then', 'instant', 'celebrity', 'sensation', 'countless', 'products', 'named', 'are', 'hit', 'sings', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'chameleon', 'dance', 'popular', 'extremist', 'groups', 'hold', 'massive', 'demonstrations', 'Communist', 'Party', 'claiming', 'exploiting', 'workers', 'holding', 'up', 'five', 'jobs', 'one', 'time', 'various', 'chameleon', 'states', 'Ku', 'Klux', 'Klan', 'claiming', 'triple', 'threat', 'can', 'be', 'Jewish', 'Negro', 'American', 'Indian.Meanwhile', 'medical', 'experts', 'are', 'stumped', 'female', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Fletcher', 'analyze', 'Zelig', 'Zelig', 'dissatisfied', 'being', 'celebrity', 'disappears', 'eventually', 'up', 'Vatican', 'balcony', 'Pope', 'St', 'Peters', 'infiltrated', 'inner', 'circle', 'purported', 'insider', 'discovered', 'imposter', 'commotion', 'balcony', 'Pope', 'addressing', 'gathered', 'throng', 'Zelig', 'deported', 'back', 'America.Dr', 'Fletcher', 'now', 'concentrate', 'solely', 'treating', 'country', 'retreat', 'Eventually', 'cure', 'group', 'experts', 'verify', 'results', 'One', 'mentions', 'nice', 'day', 'Zelig', 'now', 'so', 'self-assured', 'expert', 'not', 'agree', 'nice', 'day', 'Dr.', 'Fletcher', 'gone', 'too', 'far', 'Nevertheless', 'Zelig', 'celebrity', 'again', 'time', 'famous', 'being', 'motivational', 'speeches', 'country', 'being', 'yourself.Next', 'Zelig', 'now', 'also', 'famous', 'Dr.', 'Fletcher', 'announce', 'engagement', 'However', 'major', 'scandal', 'out', 'various', 'women', 'appear', 'claim', 'Zelig', 'married', 'one', 'chameleon', 'states', 'accused', 'bigamy', 'adultery', 'various', 'other', 'crimes', 'public', 'turns', 'showing', 'how', 'easily', 'manipulated', 'create', 'heroes', 'villains', 'pressure', 'Zelig', 'chameleon', 'state', 'again.Dr', 'Fletcher', 'desperately', 'eventually', 'background', 'newsreel', 'featuring', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'rally', 'where', 'Zelig', 'become', 'one', 'Hitler', 'inner', 'circle', 'chameleon', 'state', 'escape', 'back', 'America', 'Zelig', 'now', 'hero', 'again', 'ticker-tape', 'parade', 'New', 'York', 'get', 'married', 'fade', 'obscurity', 'so', 'documentary', 'later', 'necessary', 'educate', 'public', 'him.This', 'movie', 'also', 'apparently', 'only', 'Jews', 'can', 'make', 'jokes', 'Hitler', 'something', 'similar', 'today', 'linguistic', 'apartheid', 'where', 'blacks', 'can', 'use', 'N', 'word', 'even', 'become', 'celebrities', 'doing', 'so', 'whites', 'face', 'persecution', 'loss', 'livelihood', 'thereby', 'being', 'subject', 'new', 'discrimination']",N/A
670959,A3AUECYM0M0YSX,B00005O06N,The Man in the Hathaway Shirt,"[3, 4]","Some critics said it was too long, and the joke ran thin. To me that describes Forrest Gump. Some critics thought it was a no-concept movie. To me that describes Forrest Gump. To me this is Woody as a virtuoso filmmaker, though not the sort that Tarentino is pegged. The film makes a very true point about fame, about nostalgia, and most of all about conformity in a world that's always proud to show off its nonconformity (note the opening montage about how this was &quot;the jazz age&quot;) but which is at bottom hopelessly conformist. Forrest Gump, with its aw-shucks philosophy and cliche-embedded script, didn't dare tackle such issues. But this movie does. But if you don't GET them, as many critics didn't judging from the reviews, this film will to you seem too long. My biggest complaint is that maybe it's actually too short. I would have liked to see some of its themes explored more--admittedly tricky in the narrow confines Allen imposed on himself with his documentary structure.Here Allen runs the range of tricks to film, but they're not computer tricks (exactly). To age his film he actually scuffs it. To achieve the sound of tinny 1920s sound he records his pop songs (wonderful parodies of the real music of the time) on authentic 1920s equipment. Most of all, in sort of a post-modernist irony that is currently so hip but was fresh in 1983, he features interviews with trendy intellectuals who both reinforce and parody their academic personas by appearing on camera. Admittedly some of the jokes try too hard to be clever and fall flat, but there are also some very clever bits, such as a sequence showing the rabid commercialization of Zelig (&quot;Lenoard Zelig-approved chameleons for sale&quot;).Unlike Spinal Tap, which was sometimes a little too broad in its humor (much as I love that movie) and unlike Bob Roberts, which gave us &quot;offscreen&quot; conversations we could plainly hear (from people who wouldn't be body-miked in real life) just to extend the narrative, this movie to me strikes the perfect of rabid satire and just-bare plausibility. I also find interesting some parallels to Woody's real life. For despite appearing indifferent to critical acclaim, despite snubbing the Academy to toot his clarinet during Oscar night, Woody is at bottom a filmmaker who very much wants to be accepted, loved, even revered. Despite being self-depricating and self-critical, he clearly has an ego the size of the Chrysler building. And at the time this film was made, it seemed he had just settled in, after swinging among several girlfriends, to the love of his life, Mia Farrow. Though that wouldn't last, I have to wonder how much the last scene in this film reflects his feelings towards Farrow at the time.Unfortunately, Woody's DVDs tend to be skimpy on extras--director's commentary would be nice, or maybe a &quot;how they did it&quot; documentary. But Woody these days is about as socialable as a hermit crab. He's also not making films this good anymore. Pity, because no one else does comedy quite the way he does--or did.",4,I've always loved this little gem of a film,1090108800,"07 18, 2004",2004,3067,"['critics', 'said', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'joke', 'ran', 'thin', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'critics', 'thought', 'was', 'no-concept', 'movie', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Woody', 'virtuoso', 'filmmaker', 'not', 'sort', 'Tarentino', 'pegged', 'film', 'very', 'true', 'point', 'fame', 'nostalgia', 'most', 'conformity', 'world', 'always', 'proud', 'show', 'off', 'nonconformity', 'note', 'opening', 'montage', 'how', 'was', 'quot', 'jazz', 'age', 'quot', 'bottom', 'hopelessly', 'conformist', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'aw-shucks', 'philosophy', 'cliche-embedded', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'dare', 'tackle', 'such', 'issues', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'GET', 'many', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'judging', 'reviews', 'film', 'will', 'seem', 'too', 'long', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'maybe', 'actually', 'too', 'short', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'themes', 'explored', 'more', 'admittedly', 'tricky', 'narrow', 'confines', 'Allen', 'imposed', 'documentary', 'structure.Here', 'Allen', 'range', 'tricks', 'film', ""'re"", 'not', 'computer', 'tricks', 'exactly', 'age', 'film', 'actually', 'achieve', 'sound', 'tinny', '1920s', 'sound', 'pop', 'songs', 'wonderful', 'parodies', 'real', 'music', 'time', 'authentic', '1920s', 'equipment', 'Most', 'sort', 'post-modernist', 'irony', 'currently', 'so', 'hip', 'was', 'fresh', '1983', 'interviews', 'trendy', 'intellectuals', 'who', 'reinforce', 'parody', 'academic', 'personas', 'appearing', 'camera', 'Admittedly', 'jokes', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'clever', 'fall', 'flat', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'clever', 'bits', 'such', 'sequence', 'showing', 'rabid', 'commercialization', 'Zelig', 'quot', 'Lenoard', 'Zelig-approved', 'chameleons', 'sale', 'quot', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'was', 'sometimes', 'little', 'too', 'broad', 'humor', 'much', 'love', 'movie', 'Bob', 'Roberts', 'gave', 'quot', 'quot', 'conversations', 'could', 'plainly', 'hear', 'people', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'body-miked', 'real', 'life', 'just', 'extend', 'narrative', 'movie', 'strikes', 'perfect', 'rabid', 'satire', 'just-bare', 'plausibility', 'also', 'find', 'interesting', 'parallels', 'Woody', 'real', 'life', 'appearing', 'indifferent', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'snubbing', 'Academy', 'toot', 'clarinet', 'Oscar', 'night', 'Woody', 'bottom', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'be', 'accepted', 'loved', 'even', 'revered', 'being', 'self-depricating', 'self-critical', 'clearly', 'ego', 'size', 'Chrysler', 'building', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'seemed', 'had', 'just', 'settled', 'swinging', 'several', 'girlfriends', 'love', 'life', 'Mia', 'Farrow', 'would', ""n't"", 'last', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'last', 'scene', 'film', 'feelings', 'towards', 'Farrow', 'time.Unfortunately', 'Woody', 'DVDs', 'tend', 'be', 'skimpy', 'extras', 'director', 'commentary', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'maybe', 'quot', 'how', 'did', 'quot', 'documentary', 'Woody', 'days', 'as', 'socialable', 'hermit', 'crab', 'also', 'not', 'making', 'films', 'good', 'anymore', 'Pity', 'one', 'else', 'comedy', 'quite', 'way', 'did']",N/A
