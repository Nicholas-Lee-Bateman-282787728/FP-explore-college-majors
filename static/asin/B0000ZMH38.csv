790335,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B0000ZMH38,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[5, 11]","Late Shotaro Ishinomori is a prime example of pioneer Japanese animators that influenced people generation after generation...even though some of his past works have serious been ripped from Osamu Tezuka's creations, and from that, he made his animes looked a lot worse...okay, I'm not helping here.  The point is, he became such an influence, that the new generation of animators decided to revive an old classic of his, to remind how good his work was, for the modern Japanese audience, and now, the American audience like ourselves.Based sorely on the late 1960s anime, remake CYBORG 009 may seem like a X-men rip-off to some, but it's more, and also less, than just what it seems.  More, as in the plot construction.  These cyborgs weren't created by blueprint, they were create by the humans they used to be.  These heroes were once humans before they were abducted by an evil syndicate called the Black Ghost.  They were first observed then tested on, converting them into cyborgs for the sole purpose to be weapons of destruction.  The recent converted cyborg, Joe Shimamura, managed to escape from Black Ghost and joins the other eight cyborgs, whom also escaped from BG's wrath, in an attempt to stop the syndicate once and for all, while at the same time, getting use to their alternate lifestyle.Trying to destroy the Black Ghost syndicate might be a one-thought objective that turned me off from the series, but the one thing that got me interested in CYBORG 009 are the cyborgs themselves.  Each of them has a distinct personality, albeit stereotyped from their national background, and actually express the nature of their own being to try to get on with life that was once theirs, but was taken away.  It also lays out a back story for almost each of the person as the series progress, and their backstory can also led the characters causin' conflicts to other beings in this show, which freshens up the livelihood of the story.  It got my attention because of the series' perception, and the music score and dubbing ain't bad.Less, as in the characters' abilities.  Personally, I find the cyborgs to have the most linear and recycle powers anyone's every had.  Cyborg 001, the sleepaholic baby with a binky, has telekinetic powers and can talk to people with their minds (ooohh! [sarcasm]).  Cyborg 002, the typical N.Y. punk, flys like a jet (like 40% of the superhero population).  Cyborg 003, the cute French blond girl, has the ability to see through walls and predict certain outcomes.  Arrogant German Cyborg 004 has legs that shoot rockets.  Cyborg 005, the kooky Chinese with droopy eyes, breaths like a dragon and burrows like a mole.  Cyborg 006, the bulky Native American, is a hulk wannabe with an articulate verbal structure.  Bald Englishman Cyborg 007 transforms into any being or object of any size and object.  Cyborg 008, the ex-slave African, doesn't really have a special ability, he just swims fast and breaths underwater, which like Aquaman, is the worst superpower anyone can have.  Then there's the new kid on this block, Cyborg 009 (Joe Shimamura), a young boy with a dark past(yadda-yadda) that moves fast, quick as the Flash.So the cyborgs' powers are weak, but so is the character design.  The characters are not the prettiest by today's anime standards, and even if Shotaro back then tries to imitate the characters' design from Tezuka's design, he did a pretty poor job on that.  004's eyes looks like they were damaged during corrective surgery, the men's noses are huge and awkward, the body structures are messed up, and even with the most beautiful people in this anime (009 and 003), Roger Smith and Rei Ayanami, they are not.  What's even worse, going through half-season with this series, there's a clip show.  I do not want to see an episode containing clips from earlier episodes, that was a waste of my viewing time and the animators' money.  In my opinion, pronouncing the name &quot;00&quot; as 'zero-zero' to any character is quite ludicrous, even though I understand that saying &quot;00&quot; as 'double-oh' is a result of copyright infringment since James Bond has the right to use that for 007; also ludicris, is that after 009, it goes by 0010, instead of 010 (what?).Though I've only seen 25 of the 52 episodes it suppose to show in America, CYBORG 009 has already been appealling.  I'm surprised to the fact that Sony had some involvement with this anime.  Even though I despise Sony for the movies the company makes, when it comes to anime, they seem to done the distribution right (METROPOLIS, COWBOY BEBOP: THE MOVIE), and having this DVD release uncut with eight episodes in any of the two languages, this is no exception.  If people can ignore the ugly design and the basic premise, they might enjoy this anime.  It's not breaking any new ground, but it's purpose was to be emotional and entertaining, and CYBORG 009 does 'em both.",3,Shotaro's &quot;finest&quot; remade for the nu' mill.,1075852800,"02 4,

790337,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,B0000ZMH38,Haunted Flower,"[4, 8]","Cyborg 009 Unedited and Uncut Anime DVD Review2 Disc Widescreen Edition (2001)Cyborg 009 is an anime released in 2001 based on a manga serialized in several different Japanese magazines. The story is about nine regular humans who had been kidnapped and turned into cyborgs to be weapons for the evil Black Ghost organization. They each have different abilities and work together to try and bring down the Black Ghost organization so they can try to lead normal lives again.The animation makes this series look even older than it is. I know it's anime, but this is REALLY cartoony. Some of the other cyborgs remind me of that hamburger fellow from Popeye. The features are really exaggerated on the guys to look silly and the girls have ultra emphasized eyelashes. Young kids might like this, but teenagers and adults would quickly lose interest because there is no emotional story or dramatic action to draw you in that would be even close to on par with Naruto, Fullmetal Alchemist, or Neon Genesis Evangelion. The coolest thing about this series is the music. The opening and closing themes are both really catchy and have a bit of a dance J-Pop vibe. The music is way more up-to-date than the series itself.A little about the story and characters. We begin with 009 waking up and discovering he is a Cyborg and trying to learn his new abilities as he escapes the Black Ghost compound. He is guided by the telepathic voice of 001 which turns out to be a baby when he meets up with the rest of the group 001 through 008. They convince him the bad guys are bad (which is easy since they are being attacked) and to join them. 009 has one of the coolest powers in the group, he has an accelerator button that can slow down time around him so he can move much faster.002 has a pointy nose and an occasionally abrasive personality and can fly. 003 is the woman and all she does is take care of the baby and have psychic predictions and needs to be saved a lot. 004 is depressed and apparently has weapons in his fingers? 005 is apparently supposed to be Native American but he looks like Mr. T and is the biggest and strongest. 006 is a Chinese chef who can blow fire. 007 can push a button and disguise himself as anything or anyone. And 008 looks like a bad black-face stereotype but with a dark gray face and can swim underwater without holding his breath. You'd think as robots they could all do that...According to Wiki, these characters all have very detailed backgrounds, motivations, and complex journeys to go on since this manga series apparently originated in the 1960s which would explain a lot about the old-fashioned and out-dated appearance of the characters. Even though they were animated in 2001, they appear to be drawn out of a much older style less impressive than modern anime.The plot and dialogue is very simple. Clear cut good guys and bad guys and a old professor helping them. After the big conflict of escaping, they end of facing a series of new cyborgs one at a time. Cyborg 0010 has crazy electricity and all the other Cyborgs have to work together to win. And when they beat him....next is 0011 and 0012 and 0013. This can very quickly become tedious. They try to introduce a little more emotion (0012 is only trying to beat them so he can return to his family, 009 has a past history with 0013) but it's just so undeveloped. I don't know if the series gets magically better from here on out, but I'm not motivated to watch more, that's for sure! Why does each new cyborg have to have the double 0's? Why not 011? No clue.DVD Extras:These two discs consist of the first eight episodes of the series that are unedited and uncut. Unedited and uncut? What would they have cut out, pray tell? Other than the bad guys talking about needing to ""kill"" the cyborgs, there isn't much notable violence, no blood, guts, gore, swearing, sexual situations, anything. So I guess it's a fancy way of saying they didn't have to trim it down for commercials?

Neel ""Jemcollector""","[4, 23]","I happened across this little gem recently for two bucks in a discount/discontinued merchandise store; and it's easy to see why it was to be found there.  ( Even at that, I think I got ripped off! )  I earnestly believe this anime title to have NO redeeming features whatsoever.  It's based on what we are told was a ""classic"" anime of the 1960's.  If that's so, then why not reissue the ORIGINAL, instead of attempting to remake something this dated?  ( Not to mention trying to ""salvage"" the ghastly character designs! )  There's something disconcertingly incongruous about the mix of modern computer animation with these horrible, flat, and dated characters.The original 1960's version is touted as an originator of the concept of ""sentai"" or a group of super-heroes fighting a common enemy; in this case the unoriginal ""Black Ghost"", whose design makes Skeletor look GOOD!  Each member of the team has his ( or her ) own super-specialty, like rockets in the feet - obviously ""borrowed"" from Astro Boy.  Sadly, all that accomplishes is to keep this at the level of a very BAD stereotypical Saturday morning kiddie show.  I found it impossible to sympathize with or even like ANY of the characters, who are all total cliches.  Even watching with the original Japanese dialog was of no help this time; I can only imagine how horrible it must be with dubbing!The plot of the evil overlord trying to take over the world with his robot henchmen ( the eponymous Cyborgs of the title ) is lame enough to begin with, but I struggled heroically throughout all 8 episodes presented here TRYING to find a single redeeming feature - all in vain.  Mercifully Columbia/Tristar pulled the plug on this turkey after releasing only this ""unedited and uncut"" set of 2 DVD's, which barely scratches the surface of this long and tedious epic.  (  But if you REALLY like it, you can buy each of them separately! )  So keep in mind that should you, for some extreme masochistic reason, want to see the rest of this drivel - it's not available, THANK GOD!",1,Found at The Bottom of the Barrel,1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,2035,"['happened', 'little', 'gem', 'recently', 'two', 'bucks', 'discount/discontinued', 'merchandise', 'store', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'be', 'found', 'there', 'Even', 'think', 'got', 'ripped', 'off', 'earnestly', 'believe', 'anime', 'title', 'have', 'NO', 'redeeming', 'features', 'based', 'what', 'are', 'told', 'was', 'classic', 'anime', '1960', 'so', 'then', 'why', 'not', 'reissue', 'ORIGINAL', 'instead', 'attempting', 'remake', 'something', 'dated', 'Not', 'mention', 'trying', 'salvage', 'ghastly', 'character', 'designs', 'something', 'disconcertingly', 'incongruous', 'mix', 'modern', 'computer', 'animation', 'horrible', 'flat', 'dated', 'characters.The', 'original', '1960', 'version', 'touted', 'originator', 'concept', 'sentai', 'group', 'super-heroes', 'fighting', 'common', 'enemy', 'case', 'unoriginal', 'Black', 'Ghost', 'design', 'Skeletor', 'look', 'GOOD', 'member', 'team', 'own', 'super-specialty', 'rockets', 'feet', 'obviously', 'borrowed', 'Astro', 'Boy', 'Sadly', 'accomplishes', 'keep', 'level', 'very', 'BAD', 'stereotypical', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'kiddie', 'show', 'found', 'impossible', 'sympathize', 'even', 'ANY', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'total', 'cliches', 'Even', 'watching', 'original', 'Japanese', 'dialog', 'was', 'help', 'time', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'how', 'horrible', 'must', 'be', 'dubbing', 'plot', 'evil', 'overlord', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'robot', 'henchmen', 'eponymous', 'Cyborgs', 'title', 'lame', 'enough', 'begin', 'struggled', 'heroically', '8', 'episodes', 'presented', 'here', 'TRYING', 'find', 'single', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'vain', 'Mercifully', 'Columbia/Tristar', 'pulled', 'plug', 'turkey', 'releasing', 'only', 'unedited', 'uncut', 'set', '2', 'DVD', 'barely', 'surface', 'long', 'tedious', 'epic', 'REALLY', 'can', 'buy', 'separately', 'So', 'keep', 'mind', 'should', 'extreme', 'masochistic', 'reason', 'want', 'see', 'rest', 'drivel', 'not', 'available', 'THANK', 'GOD']",N/A

I'm happy to have this DVD, but as far as I can see here on Amazon, there's no more uncut episodes available, and that is very disappointing.

When Toonami was airing ""Cyborg 009"" they could of shown it's orginal version. I'll admite their's minor brief nudity but thats not enough for parents to be worried about. Juging by the way the characters are drawn, it's makes the show looks two cartoony which means older people will never go near this TURKEY what a waste of time.The show is about people who were once humans but turn into cyborgs by some mad scientist.",3,It's still a little kids dvds,1118016000,"06 6, 2005",2005,576,"['Even', 'dvds', 'unedited', 'uncut', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'blood', 'minor', 'profanity', 'sexually', 'humer', 'only', 'difference', 'just', 'more', 'action', 'When', 'Toonami', 'was', 'airing', 'Cyborg', '009', 'could', 'shown', 'orginal', 'version', ""'ll"", 'admite', 'minor', 'brief', 'nudity', 'not', 'enough', 'parents', 'be', 'worried', 'Juging', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'show', 'two', 'cartoony', 'older', 'people', 'will', 'never', 'go', 'TURKEY', 'what', 'waste', 'time.The', 'show', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'once', 'humans', 'turn', 'cyborgs', 'mad', 'scientist']",N/A
790342,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B0000ZMH38,Sesho,"[2, 2]","The last thing Joe Shimamura remembers is being chased by cops for a murder he did not commit and then falling hundreds of feet from a sea cliff. When he wakes up he's in a strange costume in some sort of laboratory and being told by a woman's voice that he must quickly escape! As he escapes he displays superhuman speed, agility, and toughness. He is no longer Joe Shimamura, but Cyborg 009, made for the sole purpose of helping the terrorist organization called Black Ghost take over the world! He's not the only cyborg that has rebelled against his purpose though. There are eight others with different superpowers that have chosen to go against their makers and destroy Black Ghost once and for all. But Black Ghost isn't going to let them go that easy. It sends out a series of cyborgs with increasing power to kill them all.This was a great dvd set that took a nostalgic look back at Japanese animation and manga, updating a series that originated back in the 1960s. Like the anime Metropolis, the outdated character designs give Cyborg 009  a charm and personality beyond most modern anime, though they do take some getting used to, especially 001, who is sort've an infant Professor X. Then there's 004, who fires anti-tank missles from his kneecaps! While the designs are very cartoony, the animation and the score are extremely well done. The voice acting too does a good job in selling an old story for a new audience. The only thing that puzzles me is why Black Ghost continue to manufacture the cyborgs after NINE of them rebelled and fled. It seems like by the THIRD, they would've just given up on the program! It's a shame, but these eight episodes are all that have been released from the 52 shows that comprised its original run. I assume Columbia Tristar just wasn't making any money off of them. There is also a manga published by Tokyopop.
