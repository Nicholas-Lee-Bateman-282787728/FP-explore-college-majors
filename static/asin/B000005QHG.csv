492308,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000005QHG,Acute Observer,"[2, 8]","The Paper Chase, 1973 filmThe film begins with a view of as the students enter. This is Harvard Law School, one of the oldest and most prestigious in the country. ""Never assume anything in my class."" This class is on contract law and damages for broken contracts (business life in any country). ""You've got to work like hell for good grades."" First-year students form study groups to collaborate by sharing a work load. The ""Socratic Method"" is used: questioning and answering (tests the student). There are no final and absolute answers. The students divide their work load. The movie focuses on a few students. The class is divided into three groups of students. We learn about contracts, selling and buying (life in society). Is Hart slacking off? He falls asleep during daylight hours. Later he learns about Susan, her mother's sickness, and her estranged husband. [Note the student seating chart with pictures. Was this the origin of a ""face-book""?Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr. asks questions that require analyzing the facts. These answers won't be found in a book. Hart visits Susan in her father's rooms. Kingsfield returns unexpectedly (or was this a trick of Susan's?). Hart is out in the cold. Are people irrational? Can Hart walk on water? [Until the ice breaks.] The statute of frauds is the law in every state. One student has a problem; can he be saved? Hart learns about the stored opinions of Kingsfield. Can they access his notebooks? Hart and Susan meet in a stadium. [To provide `realism' to this movie.] The courts follow the laws written by the legislature. The ""Dead Man's Statute"" can be gotten around. [What is this?] Hart is offered an assignment for research over the weekend. [Biting off more than he can chew?] He learns a lesson. The study group loses a student. There is personal conflict over the outlines. One student spends long hours studying late into the night. More questions and answers in class. Court decisions are based on precedent.Kevin is not well. Hart takes away his .22 rifle. Hart does not answer Kingsfield in class, then answers back (for drama). The final exam arrives. Students seek Hart's advice (a sign of recognized expertise). They want a quiet place to study without interruption. A maid hears them talking about criminal law? Will there be a problem? Can Room Service be suspended? [Note the technique used to avoid reaching the manager.] And so they take the test. How did Hart do?Many of the actors would become more famous on television shows. This movie was later turned into a television series. How much of an audience is there for a drama about graduate students? There have been TV shows about law firms (""The Practice"") but they were not as popular as crime shows (""Law and Order ...""). In the late 1950s there was a popular series about a lawyer (""Perry Mason""). Could such a series be popular today?",2,A Story About Law School,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,2875,"['Paper', 'Chase', '1973', 'filmThe', 'film', 'view', 'students', 'enter', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'one', 'oldest', 'most', 'prestigious', 'country', 'Never', 'assume', 'anything', 'class', 'class', 'contract', 'law', 'damages', 'broken', 'contracts', 'business', 'life', 'country', ""'ve"", 'got', 'work', 'hell', 'good', 'grades', 'First-year', 'students', 'form', 'study', 'groups', 'collaborate', 'sharing', 'work', 'load', 'Socratic', 'Method', 'used', 'questioning', 'answering', 'student', 'are', 'final', 'absolute', 'answers', 'students', 'divide', 'work', 'load', 'movie', 'few', 'students', 'class', 'divided', 'three', 'groups', 'students', 'learn', 'contracts', 'selling', 'buying', 'life', 'society', 'Hart', 'slacking', 'off', 'asleep', 'daylight', 'hours', 'Later', 'Susan', 'mother', 'sickness', 'estranged', 'husband', '[', 'Note', 'student', 'seating', 'chart', 'pictures', 'Was', 'origin', 'face-book', 'Professor', 'Charles', 'W.', 'Kingsfield', 'Jr.', 'questions', 'require', 'analyzing', 'facts', 'answers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'book', 'Hart', 'Susan', 'father', 'rooms', 'Kingsfield', 'returns', 'unexpectedly', 'was', 'trick', 'Susan', 'Hart', 'out', 'cold', 'Are', 'people', 'irrational', 'Can', 'Hart', 'walk', 'water', '[', 'ice', 'breaks', ']', 'statute', 'frauds', 'law', 'state', 'One', 'student', 'problem', 'can', 'be', 'saved', 'Hart', 'stored', 'opinions', 'Kingsfield', 'Can', 'access', 'notebooks', 'Hart', 'Susan', 'meet', 'stadium', '[', 'provide', 'realism', 'movie', ']', 'courts', 'follow', 'laws', 'written', 'legislature', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Statute', 'can', 'be', 'gotten', '[', 'What', ']', 'Hart', 'offered', 'assignment', 'research', 'weekend', '[', 'Biting', 'off', 'more', 'can', 'chew', 'lesson', 'study', 'group', 'student', 'personal', 'conflict', 'outlines', 'One', 'student', 'long', 'hours', 'studying', 'late', 'night', 'More', 'questions', 'answers', 'class', 'Court', 'decisions', 'are', 'based', 'precedent.Kevin', 'not', 'well', 'Hart', 'away', '.22', 'rifle', 'Hart', 'not', 'answer', 'Kingsfield', 'class', 'then', 'back', 'drama', 'final', 'exam', 'arrives', 'Students', 'seek', 'Hart', 'advice', 'sign', 'recognized', 'expertise', 'want', 'quiet', 'place', 'study', 'interruption', 'maid', 'talking', 'criminal', 'law', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'problem', 'Can', 'Room', 'Service', 'be', 'suspended', '[', 'Note', 'technique', 'used', 'avoid', 'reaching', 'manager', ']', 'so', 'take', 'test', 'How', 'did', 'Hart', 'do', 'Many', 'actors', 'would', 'become', 'more', 'famous', 'television', 'shows', 'movie', 'was', 'later', 'turned', 'television', 'series', 'How', 'much', 'audience', 'there', 'drama', 'graduate', 'students', 'have', 'been', 'TV', 'law', 'firms', 'Practice', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'popular', 'crime', 'shows', 'Law', 'Order', 'late', '1950s', 'was', 'popular', 'series', 'lawyer', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'Could', 'such', 'series', 'be', 'popular', 'today']",The Paper Chase VHS

The class was taught by a silver-haired Jesuit, who stood ramrod straight behind his podium at the front of the class and proceded in a manner not unlike John Houseman's Professor Kingsfield. It was only a pale shadow of what is depicted in &quot;The Paper Chase&quot;, but it was very enlightening. The way this movie vividly brings back my student days, both the fun and the hard work, is one of the reasons I like it so much. It also shows what people can accomplish.The plot involves a love affair between Hart, a student who idolizes Kingsfield, and Kingsfield's daughter. It has its funny moments, but is somewhat predictable. What elevates this movie  is the psychological study of how the different students respond to their situation, some finding it within themselves to persevere while others fall by the wayside. The film also benefits from strong acting, particularly by John Houseman, who is the quintessential Professor Kingsfield. He is outstanding.This is an excellent flick. It delivers a dramatic portrayal of an intense academic experience, while delivering some very funny moments along the way. Sort of like real life, sometimes. The TV series spawned by this movie was also quite good, and it's too bad it didn't last longer on its major network. Anyway, both college students and former college students will find a lot to  relate to here. Those whose background isn't academic, though, will also find &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; quite entertaining.

Perhaps the transfer to DVD corrected the problem, but I can't say.Timothy Bottoms is a Harvard Law School freshman in love with both his no-nonsense, unaccessible law professor (John Houseman) and the professor's daughter (Linda Wagner). Bottoms keeps skirting back and forth between making the grade in school and being more intersted in learning for its own sake. When at the end of the movie he folds his term grades up into a paper airplane without looking at them we're supposed to believe he's made the ""wise"" choice - but it's all pretty phony.Lots of things in the picture don't wear very well anymore, and much of it seems vapid. Houseman as Professor Kingsfield is the only character worth watching. And, of course, like most school flicks it looks as if Bottoms is enrolled in only this one course (STAND AND DELIVER had the same problem).

492322,AGHJ9BMVMGIOL,B000005QHG,colinwoodward,"[9, 10]","I saw this movie as an undergraduate and found it even more resonant when I got into graduate school. Although I did not study law, this movie will feel all too real for someone in an intensive post-undergraduate program. The life of the post-Bachelor's individual is truly terrifying. It's not for the weak of heart. The Paper Chase captures the world of academic stress wonderfully. All the issues are represented here: Do I have time to date? If I do, will a lover understand the need to pull an all-nighter on the weekend to finish a paper? Do my professors really expect me to finish this reading? For the serious student, life is far more like the Paper Chase than Back to School or Animal House. It's lonely, hard work, and your girlfriend will hate you sometimes for ignoring her so you can hit the books. And your professors will sometimes leave you twisting in the wind if you can't carry your own weight. Some grad school advisors are indeed like Kingsfield, thus the Houseman character is not a myth. John Houseman gets most of the good lines in this movie, but not all. Take the student lines like ""Nothing makes you hornier than studying"" or the exchange between Hart (I found it funny that even Hart's girlfrend calls him by his last name) and the failing Kevin that goes (I'm paraphrasing here), Hart: ""They're just grades, Kevin."" Kevin: ""You know better than that. It's a grade, it's a number, but it determines futures."" Paper Chase is at times painful to watch, as Hart endures flak on all sides--from his girlfriend to Kingsfield to his ""supportive"" study group. Hart does well because he's the classic good college student: an ambitious overachiever. He isn't the smartest necessarily, but he cares the most.

492325,A1AUBGENRIZODO,B000005QHG,Dave Deubler,"[4, 9]","For those to whom college is more about the love of learning than the freedom to party (this reviewer tended to fall somewhere in between) this is a pretty good film about the rigors of law school, but perhaps still not a great one.  Some of the fault may lie with lead actor Timothy Bottoms, who doesn't entirely succeed in drawing us in.  A better actor (or in any case a better script) would have made us really care about his fate, but Bottoms remains a bit of a cipher, as do most of the characters in this story.  Houseman, of course, plays this perfectly, but we aren't supposed to understand him -he's from another generation and almost another world.This story was the blueprint for many ""training"" movies made since - a small cadre of competitive young bucks are thrust together to master some skill that will push them to the limits of their abilities.  They're different types from different backgrounds, a girlfriend, a wife, and maybe a death or two among them.  But we aren't training fighter pilots here, it's Harvard Law School, where the most exciting thing that happens is getting called on in class, so viewers should be prepared for the fact that there's really no action.  Which is not to say that this isn't an interesting film (certainly the best film ever made on the subject of Studying Contract Law) but this is not ""Top Gun"", or ""Officer and a Gentleman"" or even ""Meatballs"" and it would be a mistake to let the film's accolades convince one otherwise.The real power of this story is with the students who fall by the wayside, unable to compete in an environment where competition is everything.  Their story has a ""Death of a Salesman"" punch that really has to carry the film, since very little actually happens to Bottoms' character.  His relationship with the professor's daughter is very shakily presented - one suspects that scenes between them were cut, because they often shift gears inexplicably.Ultimately there's a problem of artistic distance.  Director James Bridges assumes we will relate to the bearded, hippie-ish, privileged intellectual Bottoms, whose grades will determine whether he becomes one of the men who run the world, or whether he will be forced to settle for merely being inordinately wealthy.  Those who relate best (real-life lawyers and law-students should be shoe-ins) can be excused for loving this film, but many others will surely see these characters as detestably greedy, self-centered, and elitist.  High-school teachers and college professors can expect to see some recognizable characters and pick up a few tips on the Socratic teaching method, which might make the experience worth their while.  But women should be unsurprised to find that they are only bit players in this story, and as for minorities, there's none of the diversity we've come to expect in modern films - people of color are completely absent.Five stars for law students past, present and future - four for teachers.

While there are some obvious brief moments where the film is dated, the big themes of human interaction and the struggle to achieve success against long odds are universal and timeless. Too many ""critics"" try to pick apart this film for silly reasons (such as that it only shows the students in one professor's class, contract law), but they are completely missing the point. ""The Paper Chase"" is not a primer on going to law school, it is an entertaining couple of hours about human nature, and most people in most walks of life can see some direct correlation to a similar period of their own lives. You don't have to go to law school or be a lawyer to enjoy this film, but I'm told that many law schools to this day recommend that their incoming first-year law students see ""The Paper Chase"", mostly to set the stage for what they will deal with in their quest to achieve their goals. Of course, not every law school is Harvard Law, but it is the Harvard legend that makes this film so fascinating. The two most redeeming features of this really entertaining movie are John Houseman and Timothy Bottoms, both of whom are superbly cast and play off of one another brilliantly. This was Houseman's ""breakthrough"" role at age 71, and he went on to great fame and fortune as a result of this one film. A beautiful young Lindsay Wagner also adds a nice touch as Timothy Bottoms' on-again/off-again love interest with a twist.

Houseman won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for this role.Timothy Bottoms played Hart, the idealistic young 1-L (first year law student) who comes to Harvard from the midwest primarily because of his fascination with Kingsfield. He forms friendships and relationship with a circle of friends, each of whom is eccentric, driven, and slightly certifiable (which fits most of the law students I've known). His problems increase as he meets and begins a relationship with Kingsfield's daughter (played by Lindsay Wagner).This movie provided the inspiration for a television series, which followed some of the same characters from the film, in necessarily a different time-frame and different situations. Houseman reprised his role in this, and became a 'star' by this vehicle.My favourite scene in the film has to be (being the bibiophile that I am) the time Hart breaks into the closed stacks in the library (which contain the personal papers of the professors) to look for Kingsfield's early work, including his original notes from when he was a student in Contracts. Hart's reflection on Kingsfield's philosophical musings ('Can one make a binding contract with God?' Kingsfield had written) almost convinced me to go to law school in America (and indeed, I took the LSAT and did well).Houseman found the role of Kingsfield a double-edged sword, that, while fueling his stardom and exposure, also obscured the real person behind the role. He became typecast. Even when he went on speaking tours (coming once to my university to speak before a standing-room-only crowd at the auditorium) his Kingsfield routine was what the audience wanted; they tended to drift away as he spoke about his own life, and that was sad.Make a contract with yourself to see this excellent film, and, should the series be repeated on cable, check that out too.

It is the fear of having your name called out by the professor -- from the hundred students in the lecture theatre -- with his request that you lay out the case, that drives you to prepare well into the early hours the night before.Harvard is ultra-competitive -- it marks on a bell curve, with the bottom x% of students being automatically chucked out. (That x% may be 10%. The film doesn't spell it out, perhaps because 1973 cinema-goers weren't ready for lectures on the normal distribution.)The law school culture clashed conspicuously with the student background of the 60s/70s -- i.e. drugs, rock and roll, protests about Vietnam etc -- although little is made of this in the film. Instead we follow a year in the life of Hart, the Nice-but-Bright law student who idolises Professor Kingsfield -- determined to know everything about him, to the extent of bedding his daughter (played by Lindsay Wagner in her pre-Bionic Woman form).In this film, the lecture theatre experience (studying Contract Law with the Prof) turns out to be a breeze, compared to participating in the Study Group, which contains some really unlikeable individuals. By the end, three of the six students have dropped out of the Study Group -- one even tries to shoot himself.In the end, this film probably would be better if it didn't try also to be a romance. (I guess it was competing with 'Love Story' at the time.) Its highlights come in the lecture theatre and the study group. This is the potential for a very dark story, and I feel the director missed that opportunity.On the other hand, no accommodation is made for the audience unfamiliar with contract law -- in other words, there is plenty of technical language -- but this adds to the authority of the drama.I guess we're unlikely ever to see again the TV series of the same name that this movie spawned.

Particularly one that was as dedicated and competitive as Hart.  It would be like a lawyer trying a case and leaving the courtroom before hearing the verdict.  One can understand and, in a mercenary way, perhaps admire Hart if he pretended not to care about the grades for the sake of impressing his erratic, anti-establishment/anti-hippy girlfriend.  She doesn't make much sense, but she is cute and alluring.  But to actually throw the grades into the sea?  No.Apart from that, the scenes of the workings of law school are pretty terrific.  The characters of the study group are, for good and bad, very similar to people you actually find at law school.  Particularly Bell.  (By the way, did anyone notice that Hart's 3rd year advisor was Thirtysomething's Miles Drentell?  He is exactly the type that would say, &quot;Grades matter.&quot;)  Yet, like lawyers themselves, they're not on the whole really awful people.  Ford, the quintessential Harvard prepster, bails out James Naughton's character in class and even goes so far as to say that the subject is very difficult to understand.  Hart himself is obviously very decent.  And Kingsfield is meant to be feared, but moreover respected and admired.So the romance is a bit unrealistic, but nothing approaching Ally McBeal silliness.

This movie is special because it portrays law school is such an entertaining, and somewhat accurate manner.  It also explores the themes that we all constantly wrestle with, our natural intelligence, hard work, or ultimate capabililties, and what we are willing to sacrifice to get ahead.The feckless and overly orthodox law professors that pollute the halls and classrooms of our nation's institutes of higher legal learning won't teach you as much about law school as this film will.  The professor who appears in this film acutally explains his teaching methodology, the antiquated Socratic Method, which inspires students to learn and read through fear, which amounts to pointless question and answer sessions, which baffles students who once believed themselves to be intelligent before they were humiliated in front of their class!Professor Kingsfield's lectures and question and answer sessions in this film are frightening and are timeless displays of eloquence, much like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in Full Metal Jacket.  This movie, like no other, explores the fear and stress that law school students feel as they try to chase the paper, as they try to chase the grade.Our protaganist goes through the same struggles as real law students, as he must decide between personal and school.  Will he chase the girl that he is falling in love with?  Or will he spend the weekend studying?  Will he become the silent law school student that hopes that he does not get called on, or will he burn the midnight oil and become part of the upper echelon of law school students that savor the spotlight and volunteer to be participants in the feared Socratic nightmare?  Will he fall prey to the paper chase and sell his sould to get the grade?  You'll see law students crack, you'll see friendships fail, you'll see betrayal and competition, and you'll see disappointment in the face of the student that just can't hack it.You'll get a sense of the conflict that is played out in the minds of those students who have the natural ability, but are conflicted whether or not they want to put in the work and take the pain that is necessary to succeed in law school and be at the top of their class.The movie is entertaining, humorous, and the best part of all are the interactions between students and the sharp, aggressive law professor.",4,Watch this before you go to law school,1181088000,"06 6, 2007",2007,2420,"['are', 'plenty', 'movies', 'little', 'romance', 'little', 'drama', 'little', 'comedy', 'movie', 'special', 'law', 'school', 'such', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'accurate', 'manner', 'also', 'themes', 'constantly', 'wrestle', 'natural', 'intelligence', 'hard', 'work', 'ultimate', 'capabililties', 'what', 'are', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'get', 'ahead.The', 'feckless', 'overly', 'orthodox', 'law', 'professors', 'pollute', 'halls', 'classrooms', 'nation', 'institutes', 'higher', 'legal', 'learning', 'wo', ""n't"", 'teach', 'much', 'law', 'school', 'film', 'will', 'professor', 'who', 'film', 'acutally', 'teaching', 'methodology', 'antiquated', 'Socratic', 'Method', 'students', 'learn', 'read', 'fear', 'pointless', 'question', 'answer', 'sessions', 'students', 'who', 'once', 'believed', 'be', 'intelligent', 'were', 'humiliated', 'front', 'class', 'Professor', 'Kingsfield', 'lectures', 'question', 'answer', 'sessions', 'film', 'are', 'frightening', 'are', 'timeless', 'displays', 'eloquence', 'much', 'Gunnery', 'Sergeant', 'Hartman', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'movie', 'other', 'fear', 'stress', 'law', 'school', 'students', 'feel', 'try', 'chase', 'paper', 'try', 'chase', 'grade.Our', 'protaganist', 'same', 'real', 'law', 'students', 'must', 'decide', 'personal', 'school', 'Will', 'chase', 'girl', 'falling', 'love', 'will', 'spend', 'weekend', 'studying', 'Will', 'become', 'silent', 'law', 'school', 'student', 'not', 'get', 'called', 'will', 'burn', 'midnight', 'oil', 'become', 'part', 'upper', 'echelon', 'law', 'school', 'students', 'savor', 'spotlight', 'volunteer', 'be', 'participants', 'feared', 'Socratic', 'nightmare', 'Will', 'fall', 'prey', 'paper', 'chase', 'sell', 'sould', 'get', 'grade', ""'ll"", 'see', 'law', 'students', 'crack', ""'ll"", 'see', 'friendships', 'fail', ""'ll"", 'see', 'betrayal', 'competition', ""'ll"", 'see', 'disappointment', 'face', 'student', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hack', 'it.You', ""'ll"", 'get', 'sense', 'conflict', 'played', 'out', 'minds', 'students', 'who', 'have', 'natural', 'ability', 'are', 'conflicted', 'not', 'want', 'put', 'work', 'take', 'pain', 'necessary', 'succeed', 'law', 'school', 'be', 'top', 'class.The', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'humorous', 'best', 'part', 'are', 'interactions', 'students', 'sharp', 'aggressive', 'law', 'professor']",The Paper Chase VHS

492349,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000005QHG,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[87, 90]","I always warned students at the beginning of each year that I had screened ""The Paper Chase"" once again and was interested in using the Socratic method to spin the little tumblers of their minds.  Certainly this was the film that made me want to curb my innate desire to stand up in the classroom and pontificate on every subject under the sun.Ostensibly the film is about the pressures of first year students at Harvard Law School, but since most of us do not want to become lawyers, know any lawyers, have any dealings with lawyers or even watch television programs with lawyers, ""The Paper Chase"" ultimately succeeds as a film about wanting to learn and learning to think.  At the heart of the film is James Hart (Timothy Bottoms), come from Minnesota to learn at the feet of the great Professor Charles Kingsfield.  Despite some painful moments of confrontation in the classroom with his would be mentor-my favorite: ""Mr. Hart, here is a dime.  Take it, call your mother, and tell her there is serious doubt about you ever becoming a lawyer""-Hart finds he can play the game and play it well.  Having given his mind over to Kingsfield, the question then becomes whether his heart and soul will follow as well.  The other members of his study group (which includes Edward Herrmann and James Naughton), make different choices and take different paths in order to survive the year.  By the end of the film Hart is more alone than he was at the beginning.As Kingsfield, John Houseman is the powerful center of the film.  A producer and drama teacher for almost half a century, Houseman won the 1973 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and began a new career as an actor in films and a pitchman in television commercials (however, this was not Houseman's first film, since I know he played an admiral in the political thriller ""Seven Days in May"").  Indeed, Houseman went on to play the Kingsfield character in the ambitious television versions of the movie.  However, it is important to note that those who knew Houseman as a producer or teacher were always quick to point out that he really was acting in ""The Paper Chase.""  There might be Harvard professors fighting over the honor of being the real Kingfield, but Houseman was indeed just doing a role.As the autocratic master of his domain, Kingsfield is very much the antithesis of the traditional dedicated teacher usually presented in films about school, a point driven home in the film's final meeting between Hart and Kingsfield.  If there is a happy ending in this film, it is achieved by Hart's character on a personal, almost private level.The original novel by John Jay Osborn, Jr. was brought to the film my director James Bridges, who also did the screenplay.  Although the sub-plot where Hart discovers the young woman of his affections (Lindsay Wagner) is in fact (gasp!) Kingsfield's daughter is decidedly contrived, overall the film is an intelligent and thoughtful piece.  If you are a teacher, or are thinking about becoming a teacher, ""The Paper Chase"" is just as much recommended viewing as the more conventional fare as such classics as  ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips,"" ""To Sir, With Love,"" ""Up the Down Staircase,""  or more contemporary efforts such as ""Songs of the Heart.""",5,Required Viewing for Teachers: You too can be Kingsfield!,969494400,"09 21, 2000",2000,3242,"['always', 'warned', 'students', 'beginning', 'year', 'had', 'screened', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'interested', 'using', 'Socratic', 'method', 'spin', 'little', 'tumblers', 'minds', 'Certainly', 'was', 'film', 'made', 'want', 'curb', 'innate', 'desire', 'stand', 'up', 'classroom', 'pontificate', 'subject', 'sun.Ostensibly', 'film', 'pressures', 'first', 'year', 'students', 'Harvard', 'Law', 'School', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'become', 'lawyers', 'know', 'lawyers', 'have', 'dealings', 'lawyers', 'even', 'watch', 'television', 'programs', 'lawyers', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'ultimately', 'film', 'wanting', 'learn', 'learning', 'think', 'heart', 'film', 'James', 'Hart', 'Timothy', 'Bottoms', 'come', 'Minnesota', 'learn', 'feet', 'great', 'Professor', 'Charles', 'Kingsfield', 'painful', 'moments', 'confrontation', 'classroom', 'would', 'be', 'mentor-my', 'favorite', 'Mr.', 'Hart', 'here', 'dime', 'Take', 'call', 'mother', 'tell', 'serious', 'doubt', 'ever', 'becoming', 'lawyer', '-Hart', 'can', 'play', 'game', 'play', 'well', 'Having', 'given', 'mind', 'Kingsfield', 'question', 'then', 'heart', 'soul', 'will', 'follow', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'members', 'study', 'group', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'James', 'Naughton', 'make', 'different', 'choices', 'take', 'different', 'paths', 'order', 'survive', 'year', 'end', 'film', 'Hart', 'more', 'alone', 'was', 'beginning.As', 'Kingsfield', 'John', 'Houseman', 'powerful', 'center', 'film', 'producer', 'drama', 'teacher', 'almost', 'century', 'Houseman', 'won', '1973', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'began', 'new', 'career', 'actor', 'films', 'pitchman', 'television', 'commercials', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'Houseman', 'first', 'film', 'know', 'played', 'admiral', 'political', 'thriller', 'Seven', 'Days', 'May', 'Indeed', 'Houseman', 'went', 'play', 'Kingsfield', 'character', 'ambitious', 'television', 'versions', 'movie', 'However', 'important', 'note', 'who', 'knew', 'Houseman', 'producer', 'teacher', 'were', 'always', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'really', 'was', 'acting', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'might', 'be', 'Harvard', 'professors', 'fighting', 'honor', 'being', 'real', 'Kingfield', 'Houseman', 'was', 'indeed', 'just', 'doing', 'role.As', 'autocratic', 'master', 'domain', 'Kingsfield', 'very', 'much', 'antithesis', 'traditional', 'dedicated', 'teacher', 'usually', 'presented', 'films', 'school', 'point', 'driven', 'home', 'film', 'final', 'meeting', 'Hart', 'Kingsfield', 'happy', 'ending', 'film', 'achieved', 'Hart', 'character', 'personal', 'almost', 'private', 'level.The', 'original', 'novel', 'John', 'Jay', 'Osborn', 'Jr.', 'was', 'brought', 'film', 'director', 'James', 'Bridges', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'screenplay', 'sub-plot', 'where', 'Hart', 'young', 'woman', 'affections', 'Lindsay', 'Wagner', 'fact', 'gasp', 'Kingsfield', 'daughter', 'decidedly', 'contrived', 'film', 'intelligent', 'thoughtful', 'piece', 'are', 'teacher', 'are', 'thinking', 'becoming', 'teacher', 'Paper', 'Chase', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'recommended', 'viewing', 'more', 'conventional', 'fare', 'such', 'classics', 'Goodbye', 'Mr.', 'Chips', 'Sir', 'Love', 'Down', 'Staircase', 'more', 'contemporary', 'efforts', 'such', 'Songs', 'Heart']",The Paper Chase VHS

Timothy Bottoms plays our hero, James T. Hart, a first year student who idolizes the highly-regarded contracts professor Charles W. Kingsfield, played by John Houseman.  While this film may seem a bit slow and boring at times (sorry...no explosions), it does capture the nature of law school.

Made in seventies, this film features a group of the first year law students at Harvard Law School.  One of them is midwestern boy from Minnesota.  He is hard working and earnest.  Does not come from money (like most of the students) but has desire to make something out of his life.Group of six tudents decides to create a study group.  Each stident will take different course and write an outline.  That would help them prepare for the final exam and get on top of the class.  Their most demanding professor is most imperial person that every student is afraid of.  So our young midwesterner decides to make an outline for the most difficult course of the semester (contract law) and at the same time realizes that the girl he is in love with is his most demanding professor's own daughter; she is divorcing her husband of two years and her own father, one of the most expensive lawyers inthe country whose friends are the Supreme Court Judges handles her divorce.It is powerful story about a group of smart and talented students whose initial friendship turns into fierce competition.  As demands of the law school increase, the stress and tension skyrocket.  Before long, group of of six students becomes a group of three.  Their closeness is limited on exam preparation and personal friendships are out of question.  It puts things into perspective: law school vs. love; desire to succeed and support of the person who matter most; accepance of the status quo, or fight for the future that is uncertain and unkind most of the time.

I had seen John Houseman in a number of TV guest roles and he was always typecast in ""arisocratic bad guy"" roles, the looming intimidating Brit or brahmin. The northeastern equivalent of the way Logan Ramsey always played Southern big shots who called you ""boy"" in that menacing tone. Timothy Bottoms had always struck me as the ""spare Ryan O'Neal"" and Lindsay Wagner wasn't yet the Bionic Woman. So I wasn't expecting much. Especially since neither I nor my ex were lawyer buffs.Bottoms stars as James Hart, a Harvard Law student who is getting into the phase where law school starts to really get tough. Where certain professors take on the aspects of deities. Wagner plays Hart's girlfriend, as well as (unbeknownst to Hart until he's getting serious about her) the daughter of his most feared professor Charles Kingsfield, played by this film's real star John Houseman. He's one of those classroom tyrants who verbally and coldly dissects students the way a Biology prof would do a frog. For example (no way am I going to drop a full-fledged ""spoiler"" in here), watch for the scene where Kingsfield nails Hart's classmate (and Kingsfield wannabe"" of his study group), the oafish know-it-all Bell, who disagrees with the fairness of an inheritance law called ""The Dead Man Statute"". I guarantee you will fall out laughing the way the rest of the class did at Kingsfield's punch line. Houseman steals the whole show in the film in general, so much that a two-season TV series was spun off from this film, with Houseman billed as the lead.

Being a college student at the time, viewing the movie with several hundred other college students, was a unique experience in and of itself - making the movie much more relevant my &#34;life situation&#34; at that time.  John Houseman was the perfect choice to play Professor Charles Kingsfield, Jr.  In fact, Houseman received an Academy Award for Best Supporting actor.  Timothy Bottoms plays a convincing Hart, an aspiring law student, and a young Lindsay Wagner perfect portrays Kingsfield's fiercely independent daughter.The movie drags at times but when it gets to the final scene and Hart makes a paper airplane of his grades and &#34;flies&#34; it into the Atlantic, the theater at the University of Arizona erupted in cheering applause.

Buffington,"[8, 8]","Having attended Law School myself, I can vouch for the fact that it is typically a very special experience in one's life, perhaps not quite like any other.  The first year of law school in particular is often a jarring and transformative experience.  This is the theme of this film, which is a quite good, if perhaps slightly overdone, story about a small group of law students' first year in law school.  Law school is shown to be a ruthless process of competition and weeding out, where the professors take students who have ""a skull full of mush ...."" and teach them how to ""think like a lawyer...!""John Houseman turns in a classic performance as Professor Kingsfield, the brilliant, stern, and unforgiving Contracts professor, whom law student Timothy Bottoms comes to idolize.  Bottoms' attempt to succeed in Kingsfield's brutal Contracts classroom, where students are put on the spot and roasted on a daily basis, is the basic theme of this film.Although (typical of so many Hollywood films) this film overdramatizes the law school experience, it nevertheless does capture the essence of what is usually a unique experience for those who undergo it.  I doubt that there is an American law school student for the last 30 years who has failed to see this film--it is a legend among law students.

John Houseman is Professor William Kingsfield, a curmudgeonly contract law professor about whom Hart has ambivalent feelings of dread and admiration. Lindsay Wagner is Kingsfield's daughter, with whom Hart is having a relationship.This picture brought the so-called Socratic method of instruction into the light of day and doubtlessly inspired many professors of subjects other than the law.  It no doubt also inspired many impressionable young men to consider a career in the law (as it did me).  But the reason to really enjoy this movie is neither of those...it's Houseman's electrifying performance that netted him an Academy Award for best supporting actor.  This film also stands as a testament to the short but spectacular directorial career of the late James Bridges, who went on to direct &quot;The China Syndrome&quot; and &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; among several other films.It should also be remembered that this picture inspired a short-lived CBS television series of the same name in which Houseman reprised the Kingsfield role.  The show spawned the careers of, among others, Jon Lovitz of Saturday Night Live fame and Jane Kaczmarek (of the TV series &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;) and after its rather short-sighted cancellation by CBS was picked by Showtime, who ordered new episides, giving the series another five years of life until discontinued in 1984.Did this picture have an impact?  Absolutely.  Was it good?  You bet!

You'll get your little diploma, your piece of paper that's no different from this and you can stick it in your silver box with all the other paper in your life: your birth certificate, your driver's license, your marriage license, your stock certificates, and your Will.""The above comes from this extremely entertaining movie that tells the story of Hart (Timothy Bottoms), a first-year law student at Harvard Law School (in Cambridge, Massachusetts), and his experiences with Professor Kingsfield (John Houseman), the brilliant, demanding contract law instructor whom he both idolizes and finds very intimidating.  Hart's and Kingsfield's academic relationship grows even more complex when Hart discovers the woman he's dating is the professor's married daughter (Lindsay Wagner).In the above quotation, the professor's daughter (named Susan) is talking to Hart.  The ""he"" in ""he's got you scared to death"" is Professor Kingsfield.  She holds up a package of toilet paper when she says ""that's no different from this.""This movie is based on the novel ""The Paper Chase"" (1970) by John Jay Osborn, Jr. who is now a novelist, lawyer, and law professor.  (In fact, Osborn is now at The University of San Francisco School of Law where he teaches, among other subjects, contract law.)  This movie follows the novel very closely.Hart, at the beginning of the year, is invited into a study group with five other first year law students.  Even though the story specifically follows Hart, it generally follows the other group members as well.  By the time final exams come along, only three of six of these law students remain in the study group.The study group members are:(1) Hart(2) Ford (""King Bow-Tie S**t"")(3) Kevin (who's proud to have a ""photographic memory"")(4) Anderson (""the robot pimp"")(5) Bell (""as in Liberty Bell"")(6) O'Connor (""just a little pimp"")The acting could scarcely be better.  Yes, Bottoms and Wagner do a good job.  Houseman (aged 71) does a superlative job.  (In fact, he won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  That's pretty good considering that this was his first major movie role.)  I also have to give kudos to the others who portrayed law students in the study group such as Edward Herrmann (as Anderson) and James Naughton (as Kevin).I also enjoyed the classical music excerpts by Bach and Telemann.  These were added at the right moment to enhance certain scenes.This movie conveys many messages to the viewer (some of which may get some viewers angry).  One is the impersonal nature of law school.  Thus, everybody is referred to by their last name.  Even Susan talks to Hart using his last name.  Since the character Kevin is referred to mainly by his first name, you know something is going to happen to him (and it does).A challenge to the viewer (or at least to this viewer) is to try and figure out the full names of Kingsfield and the study group members (if possible).  By carefully listening and observing I learned Kingsfield's and Hart's first name and middle initial.  I also learned Anderson's first name and Kevin's last name.  As well, I did discover Bell's first initial.I forgot to mention that one of the things each study group member had to do, before final exams, was to prepare a course outline.  The challenge is to figure out what course each group member was outlining.  I managed to deduce what all six study group members were outlining.  (Actually, I'm absolutely sure what four group members were outlining and fairly sure what the remaining two group members were outlining.)This movie spawned a television series that lasted for four seasons.One thing I've read is that this movie is only for law students and lawyers.  NO.  This movie is for anybody that wants to experience what it's like to learn a large amount of information in a relatively short amount of time.Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2003) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has two extras: an audio commentary and theatrical trailer.

Listen to Robert C. Thompson's commentary.  It's the best commentary I've heard yet for a movie on DVD.  He tells you all you need to know-from the movie studio balking at making ""a movie about a bunch of lawyers"" to Lindsay Wagner's affectless performance.  The key to liking this movie depends completely on 2 things:  1)Can you transport yourself to the early 70s enviroment of Harvard Law School without letting the 'time travel' affect your opinion of the movie, and, 2)Can you get into the characters and their relationships with one another enough to appreciate great performances all around (minus Wagner's)?  I love 70s movies myself.  They're 'brown' and don't rely on constant cutaways to interest the viewer.  Whether you were there or not, 70s movies made an indelible mark on cinema.  Whether you like 'The Paper Chase' or not doesn't matter.  It still stands as one of those movies.

But it was so enjoyable I stayed to the end. A late night for this old geezer, but a most enjoyable one. Can't believe it's been almost forty years since THE PAPER CHASE came out. But it's still a damn good film, if slightly dated. Timothy Bottoms as first-year law student Hart was most believable. John Houseman earned that Oscar for his portrayal of Kingsfield. And then there is young and dewy-eyed Lindsay Wagner before she was a six-million dollar woman. And remember when there was only one telephone per floor in college dorms? The writing is good, the acting is good, there is humor, pathos and tragedy. So did I like it for its excellence or for its nostalgia quotient? Probably both. And Timothy Bottoms, where are you? I remember you best for playing Sonny inThe Last Picture Show: The Definitive Director's Cut (Special Edition), but you were so great in this one too. (After seeing the film I remember going out and buying the bookThe Paper Chaseand reading it - also very good.) Was it your last good one? (Sigh!)
