As I was stuck (twice) with that other version and I have purchased this version from this site I can state without qualifications this one does not have post-production censorship. Whatever the original production was,this is it.Newly introduced into this continuing farse are Lala's twin sisters,Momo and Nana and a something that was a potted plant in the flower garden and is now a small child of sorts;no explainations beyond that are given.The designs of the sisters is exceptional and they are unusually attractive and as lively as LaLa...and even more mischievious.Rito,the designated ""hero"",somehow manages to get his head and/or hands up the skirt of some female (and once up the skirt of a male)or a handful of teen-ager boobs or is caught naked in the bath in every episode;not that it was his intent,mind you.This series is broken into 3 dozen mini-episodes of about 8 minutes each,set in clusters of 3 much like OVAs that,except for the last 3,the storylines are not related to each other.This is not a course in astrophysics or any other scholary persuit so watching this probably isn't going to do much for acidemica. This is a very well drawn,fast-paced series of fan-servise,nudity and just plain comedic ecchi(naughtiness) but,except for the merging ""lotitaconism"" of Mikan,the middle school sister,it is otherwise devoid of vulgarity. Mikan,Rito's 14-year-old sister has a role as the ""straight"" man in a comedy act whose dead-pan comments and reactions to total lunacy add immeasurably to the series and is the ONLY sane and stable member of the entire cast,as it were, was generaly left alone in the previous season and this is also done so for the first half of this season,her modesty begins to be outraged in the later half to the point of being pantsed and fondled by her brother,gratuitious panty shots and her underwear pulled by  aliens.A 5 star rating based soley on the artwork and the apparent success of the artists/directors to produce ""delightfully  naughty nonsense"" as opposed to a serious work is reduced by a half star bring this work to 4 and a half stars because to the williness to outrage a MIDDLE school early teen for no apparent reason except to toss a ""bone"" to jerks.Still,this version anime is funny and well worth the time/money for those 16+.Any other version not released by this company is a waste of money and will only make you really cranky,REALLY cranky!",4,Motto to Love Ru,1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,2529,"['edition', 'advertised', 'page', 'site', 'NOT', 'highly', 'censored', 'one', 'was', 'reviewed', 'above', 'reviewer', 'was', 'stuck', 'twice', 'other', 'version', 'have', 'purchased', 'version', 'site', 'can', 'state', 'qualifications', 'one', 'not', 'have', 'post-production', 'censorship', 'original', 'production', 'was', 'it.Newly', 'introduced', 'continuing', 'farse', 'are', 'Lala', 'twin', 'sisters', 'Momo', 'Nana', 'something', 'was', 'potted', 'plant', 'flower', 'garden', 'now', 'small', 'child', 'sorts', 'explainations', 'are', 'given.The', 'designs', 'sisters', 'exceptional', 'are', 'unusually', 'attractive', 'as', 'lively', 'LaLa', 'even', 'more', 'mischievious.Rito', 'designated', 'hero', 'somehow', 'get', 'head', 'and/or', 'up', 'skirt', 'female', 'once', 'skirt', 'male', 'handful', 'teen-ager', 'boobs', 'caught', 'naked', 'bath', 'episode', 'not', 'was', 'intent', 'mind', 'you.This', 'series', 'broken', '3', 'dozen', 'mini-episodes', '8', 'minutes', 'set', 'clusters', '3', 'much', 'OVAs', 'last', '3', 'storylines', 'are', 'not', 'related', 'other.This', 'not', 'course', 'astrophysics', 'other', 'scholary', 'persuit', 'so', 'watching', 'probably', ""n't"", 'going', 'do', 'much', 'acidemica', 'very', 'well', 'drawn', 'fast-paced', 'series', 'fan-servise', 'nudity', 'just', 'plain', 'comedic', 'ecchi', 'naughtiness', 'merging', 'lotitaconism', 'Mikan', 'middle', 'school', 'sister', 'otherwise', 'devoid', 'vulgarity', 'Mikan', 'Rito', '14-year-old', 'sister', 'role', 'straight', 'man', 'comedy', 'act', 'dead-pan', 'comments', 'reactions', 'total', 'lunacy', 'add', 'immeasurably', 'series', 'ONLY', 'sane', 'stable', 'member', 'entire', 'cast', 'were', 'was', 'generaly', 'left', 'alone', 'previous', 'season', 'also', 'done', 'so', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'modesty', 'begins', 'be', 'outraged', 'later', 'half', 'point', 'being', 'pantsed', 'fondled', 'brother', 'gratuitious', 'panty', 'shots', 'underwear', 'pulled', 'aliens.A', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'based', 'soley', 'artwork', 'apparent', 'success', 'artists/directors', 'produce', 'delightfully', 'naughty', 'nonsense', 'opposed', 'serious', 'work', 'reduced', 'half', 'star', 'bring', 'work', '4', 'half', 'williness', 'outrage', 'MIDDLE', 'school', 'early', 'teen', 'apparent', 'reason', 'toss', 'bone', 'jerks.Still', 'version', 'anime', 'funny', 'well', 'time/money', '16+.Any', 'other', 'version', 'not', 'released', 'company', 'waste', 'money', 'will', 'only', 'make', 'really', 'cranky', 'REALLY']",Motto to Loveru Complete Collection

But the characters are cute & loveable, and the show was funny without ever getting too raunchy. I rooted for Rito to hook up with the girl he adores, Haruna (who also has a secret crush on him).I saw this follow up season over the web on fansub videos. This season apparaantly is more closer to the manga (I have never read), which is more racey on the fan service side. Because it was a TV show that didn't look like it was made for TV, there was a lot of white glare filling the screen every other scene. The show was not nearly as endearing as the first season where there was some character devolopment, as this is a bunch of short skits (2-3 per half hour episode) with a lot of fan service, and no overall character development or story. If you enjoy fan service shows, this would be a very good one if released without the post production Japanese TV censorship. If that remains on this release, I can't see that it would appeal to very many as it does not stand up on it's own without the fan service, and on the other hand all those T&A; gags look lame with the ""holy white glare"" appearing every time to cover it up.",3,"review of the show, not this DVD",1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,1273,"['liked', 'season', 'one', 'goofyness', 'combined', 'heart', 'even', 'fan', 'service', 'be', 'core', 'reason', 'shows', 'even', 'exist', 'characters', 'are', 'cute', 'loveable', 'show', 'was', 'funny', 'ever', 'getting', 'too', 'raunchy', 'rooted', 'Rito', 'hook', 'up', 'girl', 'Haruna', 'who', 'also', 'secret', 'crush', '.I', 'saw', 'follow', 'up', 'season', 'web', 'fansub', 'videos', 'season', 'apparaantly', 'more', 'closer', 'manga', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'more', 'racey', 'fan', 'service', 'side', 'was', 'TV', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'was', 'lot', 'white', 'glare', 'filling', 'screen', 'other', 'scene', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'endearing', 'first', 'season', 'where', 'was', 'character', 'devolopment', 'bunch', 'short', 'skits', '2-3', 'hour', 'episode', 'lot', 'fan', 'service', 'overall', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'enjoy', 'fan', 'service', 'shows', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'released', 'post', 'production', 'Japanese', 'TV', 'censorship', 'release', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'would', 'appeal', 'very', 'many', 'not', 'stand', 'up', 'own', 'fan', 'service', 'other', 'hand', 'T', 'A', 'gags', 'look', 'lame', 'holy', 'white', 'glare', 'appearing', 'time', 'cover', 'up']",Motto to Loveru Complete Collection

I wondered why Rito's best friend was in love with Rito's girl transformation. I did some research and found that there was an OVA in-between the first season and this one. Many questions you have with this season should be answered if you see the OVA. Unfortunately, I don't think that Sentai has released it to us yet.This season is exactly what you would expect after seeing season 1. It is more perverted, and there is way more nudity. Not the blurry kind either. The comedy, romance, and drama are all a little better than season 1. Not much really happens in this season though. I really liked the climax. It is kind of a hard series to end and please everyone. I think that they did a pretty good job. I strongly recommend this anime to any fan that doesn't mind pervy situations and nudity. It's produced quite well and a whole lot of fun. My only 2 complaints are the lack of an English dub and the skipping of the OVA, which really needs to be seen before this season.

The ova series of 6 episodes is the reals econd series, and introduces some crucial characters, including Lala's younger twin sisters Momo and Nana, as well as Celine. The ova also introduces Rito's female self, Riko. If you go from the first series to the third, you will be needlessly confused. Sentai has licensed the fourth series, Darkness, but has still not even acknowledged they missed a series; they call Darkness season three, which it definitely is not.Sentai also does a substandard job on the translation and the subtitles in this series. At one point they mistranslate ""class representative"" as ""head of the council."" Sorry, but Haruna is not President of her school's student council. Not even remotely.This is a good series, but I will be discarding my hopeless Sentai dvds (it even has audio and video glitches), and keeping the fansubbed Japanese bluray rips, which have superior video quality AND better subtitles. I firmly believe in supporting the industry by buying legal retail dvds and blurays, but there are limits, and mediocre quality like this passes mine.
