I have read the first 12 graphic novel collections of the comic, so it may seem like I know what will happen but like real life: you cannot predict the future.

1671534,A4WEZJOIZIV4U,B00FFSTP94,"Chuck Bittner ""Disabled comedian & gamer!""","[0, 0]",I will start by saying I love The Walking Dead is just a great modern zombie story.  Personally I like questioning what I would do in certain situations when I'm watching the events on the show. To be honest  there is a lot that the characters do on the show that I would not do in real life. And I think that's a great thing with the show's you can use it as a springboard for some funny conversations and even some serious ones about a zombie apocalypse.I was in a state of the bundle price at the time of writing this review is pretty good when compared to buying the individual seasons separately. Now this only because at the time of writing this the bundle is $72 and they sell season three for $40+. The reason I bring this up if you're reading this in the not-too-distant future it might be better just to buy the seasons individually whenever season three hits the $20 price range. At that point all three seasons would cost you under $60 while Amazon usually keeps their bundles higher than individual purchases.The one thing I want to talk about also is the standard definition DVD quality. The show of course is shot in high definition and it looks great but there's something about this show when you watch it in low definition or DVD quality to me that adds to the effect and creepiness. There are a few shows on television that definitely benefit from the DVD upscale on a big screen Boardwalk Empire and The Walking Dead are two of them.One last thing I want to say is that season two is the slowest season but if you can endure through it it definitely gets way better.Thanks for reading!,5,A great zombie show plus HD vs DVD quality.,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,1605,"['will', 'start', 'saying', 'love', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'just', 'great', 'modern', 'zombie', 'story', 'Personally', 'like', 'questioning', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'certain', 'situations', 'when', ""'m"", 'watching', 'events', 'show', 'be', 'honest', 'lot', 'characters', 'do', 'show', 'would', 'not', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'think', 'great', 'thing', 'show', 'can', 'use', 'springboard', 'funny', 'conversations', 'even', 'serious', 'ones', 'zombie', 'apocalypse.I', 'was', 'state', 'bundle', 'price', 'time', 'writing', 'review', 'pretty', 'good', 'when', 'compared', 'buying', 'individual', 'seasons', 'separately', 'Now', 'only', 'time', 'writing', 'bundle', '72', 'sell', 'season', 'three', '40+', 'reason', 'bring', 'up', ""'re"", 'reading', 'not-too-distant', 'future', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'just', 'buy', 'seasons', 'individually', 'whenever', 'season', 'three', '20', 'price', 'range', 'point', 'three', 'seasons', 'would', 'cost', '60', 'Amazon', 'usually', 'bundles', 'higher', 'individual', 'purchases.The', 'one', 'thing', 'want', 'talk', 'also', 'standard', 'definition', 'DVD', 'quality', 'show', 'course', 'shot', 'high', 'definition', 'great', 'something', 'show', 'when', 'watch', 'low', 'definition', 'DVD', 'quality', 'effect', 'creepiness', 'are', 'few', 'shows', 'television', 'definitely', 'benefit', 'DVD', 'upscale', 'big', 'screen', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'are', 'two', 'them.One', 'last', 'thing', 'want', 'say', 'season', 'two', 'slowest', 'season', 'can', 'endure', 'definitely', 'way', 'better.Thanks', 'reading']",Walking Dead: Seasons 1-3 Bundle

With good acting and a good story and a lot of gore and little to no cgi which I like. I think special effects are a dying art and love when the use them it sort of reminds me of old horror movies like the Evil Dead and Friday the 13th movies. Its like a B-movie zombie movie come to life with a big budget and better actors which is a good thing. Cool and interesting characters and some that you don't care about so much. Very unexpected stuff happens all the time and it just has this spooky intense vibe all the time. Classic show and sort of has broke new ground!

I couldn't picture myself getting into a gory horror show about a Zombie Apocalypse.  I watched the pilot episode at my sister's and I was immediately hooked.  It's amazing.  Yes, it's gory but it's so character driven and the writing is brilliant.  The actors are fantastic. I love these characters and I want them to survive this crazy screwed up world.  You just become so wrapped up in their lives and their struggle to just get through each day and it's heartbreaking when you lose one of them.  Nearly every episode, I am an emotional wreck, scared, hiding behind my hands and hanging by the edge of my seat on this non-stop thrill ride.  I am in love with this show and would put it right up there with Game of Thrones.  You don't even have to be a horror fan to enjoy this because it's so much more than that, you just need a love for brilliant, character-driven story telling.
