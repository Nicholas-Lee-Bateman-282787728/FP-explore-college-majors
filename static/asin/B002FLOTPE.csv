1266367,A1SCTVPIUSKQ8U,B002FLOTPE,"Edward A. Jones ""cruiser621""","[6, 6]","I caught unto this series via the Dexter box sets we purchased at a local Target store (series 1 & 2 which were on sale). Included with each was a complete 2-episode teaser from season 1 & 2 from the Brotherhood.  Needless to say, we had to have the Dexter Season 3 and now wait anxiousily for Season 4-Dexter! The fact of the matter is I got hooked on the Brotherhood series thru Dexter and I am now waiting for it to arrive in the mail!  This show is so great and no, it's not an Irish Sopranos!!! It's terriffic!!! Showtime was real smart to throw in teasers like this; especially for folks like myself  who do not subscribe to Showtime (the new HBO). Keep up the good work Showtime!!!

1266369,A1SV22OU1E7XRX,B002FLOTPE,ocarolan,"[8, 8]","This series, whether acknowledged or not, was inspired by the Bulger brothers of Boston, whose story is detailed in a number of books, among them ""Black Mass: The True Story of an Unholy Alliance Between the FBI and the Irish Mob"" by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. James ""Whitey"" Bulger, a brutal career criminal, rose to control the Irish mob in Boston while his brother Billy rose to be the kingpin of Massachusetts politics. As an FBI informant, James Bulger cannily exploited the FBI's tunnel-vision focus on the Boston mafia to the point his FBI handler, whose roots, like Bulger's, were in South Boston, sabotaged efforts by the State Police to bring Bulger down. Alerted by his FBI handler that indictments against him were coming down, Bulger disappeared in 1995. Despite a spot on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List and a $2-million reward, he remains at large. (Bulger's FBI handler was sentenced to 10 years for racketeering in 2002.)Here, the setting is shifted from Boston to Providence, RI, and while there are alterations and embellishments in the name of dramatic license, the major elements of the Bulger brothers' story remain in Tommy Caffee's ascendance in the State Legislature; in Michael Caffee's wresting control of the local Irish mob and in his relationship with the local mafia family; in the FBI's arrogance and single-minded pursuit of the mafia; in the fierce tribalism of the Irish community; in the series' denouement.I found none of the characters particularly likeable or sympathetic. That is not, however, a reflection on the acting, which is uniformly top-notch, it's just the nature of the story. (The one quibble I have is that the facial features of the actors playing the Caffee brothers are so disparate that not even fine acting convinced me they were brothers.) Though neither the story nor the characters are as rich as those of The Wire or The Sopranos, this series is one worth owning.Update: Whitey Bulger and his girl friend Catherine Greig were arrested in Santa Monica, California, in June 2011. While the mystery of Bulger's whereabouts has been solved, the mystery of how he and Greig eluded authorities for 16 years has not, as of this note. That story, or what passes for it (my money is on the full truth never coming out), will be fodder for books, certainly, and perhaps a movie or mini-series.",4,The Bulger brothers by proxy,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,2346,"['series', 'acknowledged', 'not', 'was', 'inspired', 'Bulger', 'brothers', 'Boston', 'story', 'detailed', 'number', 'books', 'Black', 'Mass', 'True', 'Story', 'Unholy', 'Alliance', 'Between', 'FBI', 'Irish', 'Mob', 'Dick', 'Lehr', 'Gerard', ""O'Neill"", 'James', 'Whitey', 'Bulger', 'brutal', 'career', 'criminal', 'rose', 'control', 'Irish', 'mob', 'Boston', 'brother', 'Billy', 'rose', 'be', 'kingpin', 'Massachusetts', 'politics', 'FBI', 'informant', 'James', 'Bulger', 'cannily', 'exploited', 'FBI', 'tunnel-vision', 'focus', 'Boston', 'mafia', 'point', 'FBI', 'handler', 'roots', 'Bulger', 'were', 'South', 'Boston', 'sabotaged', 'efforts', 'State', 'Police', 'bring', 'Bulger', 'down', 'Alerted', 'FBI', 'handler', 'indictments', 'were', 'coming', 'down', 'Bulger', 'disappeared', '1995', 'spot', 'FBI', 'Ten', 'Most', 'Wanted', 'List', '2-million', 'reward', 'large', 'Bulger', 'FBI', 'handler', 'was', 'sentenced', '10', 'years', 'racketeering', '2002', 'Here', 'setting', 'shifted', 'Boston', 'Providence', 'RI', 'are', 'alterations', 'embellishments', 'name', 'dramatic', 'license', 'major', 'elements', 'Bulger', 'brothers', 'story', 'remain', 'Tommy', 'Caffee', 'ascendance', 'State', 'Legislature', 'Michael', 'Caffee', 'wresting', 'control', 'local', 'Irish', 'mob', 'relationship', 'local', 'mafia', 'family', 'FBI', 'arrogance', 'single-minded', 'pursuit', 'mafia', 'fierce', 'tribalism', 'Irish', 'community', 'series', 'denouement.I', 'found', 'none', 'characters', 'particularly', 'likeable', 'sympathetic', 'not', 'however', 'reflection', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'top-notch', 'just', 'nature', 'story', 'one', 'quibble', 'have', 'facial', 'features', 'actors', 'playing', 'Caffee', 'brothers', 'are', 'so', 'disparate', 'not', 'even', 'fine', 'acting', 'convinced', 'were', 'brothers', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'as', 'rich', 'Wire', 'Sopranos', 'series', 'one', 'worth', 'owning.Update', 'Whitey', 'Bulger', 'girl', 'friend', 'Catherine', 'Greig', 'were', 'arrested', 'Santa', 'Monica', 'California', 'June', '2011', 'mystery', 'Bulger', 'whereabouts', 'been', 'solved', 'mystery', 'how', 'Greig', 'eluded', 'authorities', '16', 'years', 'not', 'note', 'story', 'what', 'money', 'full', 'truth', 'never', 'coming', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'fodder', 'books', 'certainly', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'mini-series']",Brotherhood:  Three Season Pack
