1494616,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B005MYEPX2,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[0, 0]","amazon does not allow reviewers half stars.  this movie would be graded 3.5 by me if i could do so because it is a tv movie and does achieve what it sets out to do.  it cannot be compared to the quality of a feature film though.tracy pollan does a good job as beth holloway, the mother of presumably murdered Natalee Holloway. her daughter's body was never found although it was suspected that a young man in Aruba murdered her. he was seen with her the last night she was seen alive but there is no evidence linking him to murdering her.beth holloway is a hard character to like.  this is because she is absolutely obsessed by this case and will in no way come to any sort of peace over the loss of her daughter.  this might be less grating if she didn't have another child, a son, in college, plus a now ex husband, whom she drove away with this obsession. she even uses the son's college tuition money to fund her obsession. (this i find a black mark on her character.) however, on the other hand, it must be incredibly difficult to come to terms with a death when there is no body. holloway pursues this young man in Aruba as if getting him will put both her and Natalee at rest.  I have my doubts.this actually could have been a stunning feature film about the destructive force of obsession on everyone around you but the resulting movie would have been a very harrowing look at beth holloway.  probably no one wants to make that while she is alive because she has already suffered enough. i am sure no one can be around beth holloway for long as this obsession is her entire raison d'etre. it must be very difficult being her son.",4,3.5 tv movie of the week-descent into obsession,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,1637,"['amazon', 'not', 'allow', 'reviewers', 'half', 'stars', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'graded', '3.5', 'i', 'could', 'do', 'so', 'tv', 'movie', 'achieve', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'quality', 'feature', 'film', 'though.tracy', 'pollan', 'good', 'job', 'beth', 'holloway', 'mother', 'presumably', 'murdered', 'Natalee', 'Holloway', 'daughter', 'body', 'was', 'never', 'found', 'was', 'suspected', 'young', 'man', 'Aruba', 'murdered', 'was', 'seen', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'seen', 'alive', 'evidence', 'linking', 'murdering', 'her.beth', 'holloway', 'hard', 'character', 'like', 'absolutely', 'obsessed', 'case', 'will', 'way', 'come', 'sort', 'peace', 'loss', 'daughter', 'might', 'be', 'less', 'grating', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'child', 'son', 'college', 'now', 'ex', 'husband', 'whom', 'drove', 'away', 'obsession', 'even', 'son', 'college', 'tuition', 'money', 'fund', 'obsession', 'i', 'find', 'black', 'mark', 'character', 'however', 'other', 'hand', 'must', 'be', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'come', 'terms', 'death', 'when', 'body', 'holloway', 'young', 'man', 'Aruba', 'getting', 'will', 'put', 'Natalee', 'rest', 'have', 'doubts.this', 'actually', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stunning', 'feature', 'film', 'destructive', 'force', 'obsession', 'everyone', 'resulting', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'harrowing', 'look', 'beth', 'holloway', 'probably', 'one', 'make', 'alive', 'already', 'suffered', 'enough', 'i', 'am', 'sure', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'beth', 'holloway', 'long', 'obsession', 'entire', 'raison', ""d'etre"", 'must', 'be', 'very', 'difficult', 'being', 'son']",Justice for Natalee Holloway

1494620,A387BD735MI50R,B005MYEPX2,R. Schultz,"[2, 2]","This movie is NOT the ""Natalee Holloway"" movie that aired on Lifetime Movie Network in 2009. That movie was a ""true crime"" feature that focused on Natalee's disappearance and presented a number of hypothetical scenarios that might explain her fate on the island of Aruba. That movie also included references to many of the large number of people who have come forward since Natalee's disappearance claiming to have some knowledge of what happened to her.This movie, by contrast, focuses more strictly on Natalee's mother and her efforts to extract some solid information from Joran van der Sloot, presumed by most investigators to have played some key role in Natalee's vanishing. ""Justice for Natalee"" traces Beth Holloway's anguished response to one after another of van der Sloot's teasing implications that he would reveal Natalee's whereabouts - for a price, for publicity, for a variety of other considerations. As depicted here, van der Sloot keeps Beth Holloway on an emotional roller-coaster by continuously dangling the possibility of giving her some closure. It's a depiction of a true sociopath, someone for whom killing might be just the start of his cruelty.I had a little trouble ""getting into"" this true-life drama. The actors chosen to portray members of the van der Sloot family never seem to master a Dutch accent. Their speech is halting and unconvincing. Then especially at the beginning of the film, there's some over-use of a split-screen technique, with two and even three boxes of narrative running at once. The viewer is fractioned into too many simultaneous plot lines and time-lines, making the film resemble a 3-ring circus. But once the action settles into one coherent narrative, you are likely to be better drawn into Beth's pain as she turns the resolution of the mystery of her daughter's disappearance into her whole existence.This film looks just a bit too make-shift and made-for-TV for me to rate it 4 stars, but it is still worth viewing. Again, although its emphasis is not on the true-crime aspects of this case, it does follow van der Sloot's trajectory through to the provable crime he ends up committing.",3,Chronicles a Mother's Pain,1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,2148,"['movie', 'NOT', 'Natalee', 'Holloway', 'movie', 'aired', 'Lifetime', 'Movie', 'Network', '2009', 'movie', 'was', 'true', 'crime', 'feature', 'focused', 'Natalee', 'disappearance', 'presented', 'number', 'hypothetical', 'scenarios', 'might', 'explain', 'fate', 'island', 'Aruba', 'movie', 'also', 'included', 'references', 'many', 'large', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'forward', 'Natalee', 'disappearance', 'claiming', 'have', 'knowledge', 'what', 'happened', 'her.This', 'movie', 'contrast', 'more', 'strictly', 'Natalee', 'mother', 'efforts', 'extract', 'solid', 'information', 'Joran', 'van', 'der', 'Sloot', 'presumed', 'most', 'investigators', 'have', 'played', 'key', 'role', 'Natalee', 'vanishing', 'Justice', 'Natalee', 'traces', 'Beth', 'Holloway', 'anguished', 'response', 'one', 'van', 'der', 'Sloot', 'teasing', 'implications', 'would', 'reveal', 'Natalee', 'whereabouts', 'price', 'publicity', 'variety', 'other', 'considerations', 'depicted', 'here', 'van', 'der', 'Sloot', 'Beth', 'Holloway', 'emotional', 'roller-coaster', 'continuously', 'dangling', 'possibility', 'giving', 'closure', 'depiction', 'true', 'sociopath', 'someone', 'whom', 'killing', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'start', 'cruelty.I', 'had', 'little', 'trouble', 'getting', 'true-life', 'drama', 'actors', 'chosen', 'portray', 'members', 'van', 'der', 'Sloot', 'family', 'never', 'seem', 'master', 'Dutch', 'accent', 'speech', 'halting', 'unconvincing', 'Then', 'especially', 'beginning', 'film', 'over-use', 'split-screen', 'technique', 'two', 'even', 'three', 'boxes', 'narrative', 'running', 'once', 'viewer', 'fractioned', 'too', 'many', 'simultaneous', 'plot', 'lines', 'time-lines', 'making', 'film', 'resemble', '3-ring', 'circus', 'once', 'action', 'one', 'coherent', 'narrative', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'better', 'drawn', 'Beth', 'pain', 'resolution', 'mystery', 'daughter', 'disappearance', 'whole', 'existence.This', 'film', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'make-shift', 'made-for-TV', 'rate', '4', 'stars', 'still', 'worth', 'viewing', 'Again', 'emphasis', 'not', 'true-crime', 'aspects', 'case', 'follow', 'van', 'der', 'Sloot', 'trajectory', 'provable', 'crime', 'up', 'committing']",Justice for Natalee Holloway
