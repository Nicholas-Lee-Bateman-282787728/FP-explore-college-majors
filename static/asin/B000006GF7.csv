However, the film doesn't hold water in a few places - where it is trying to &#34;bring you in,&#34; it just kind of leaves you hanging. You can't quite penetrate the outer layer.  It's a good story - and the grandfather is a great character and has a meaningful relationship with the boy.

It is a film that is quiet and slow, but that provides the patient viewer with innumerable rewards.  The plot concerns the accidental death of the oldest son in the family and the blame placed on the youngest son for this death.  Although the family does not directly blame the youngest son, he feels tremendous guilt and the family memebers slowly pull away from him and each other.  The movie has a great feel for rural families and small-town life and doesn't provide any easy answers or excess sentiment.  Look for Linda Hamilton in a small early role as a bus passenger.",5,Superb quiet film,1012521600,"02 1, 2002",2002,637,"['saw', 'movie', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'deeply', 'moved', 'film', 'quiet', 'slow', 'patient', 'viewer', 'innumerable', 'rewards', 'plot', 'accidental', 'death', 'oldest', 'son', 'family', 'blame', 'placed', 'youngest', 'son', 'death', 'family', 'not', 'directly', 'blame', 'youngest', 'son', 'tremendous', 'guilt', 'family', 'memebers', 'slowly', 'pull', 'away', 'other', 'movie', 'great', 'feel', 'rural', 'families', 'small-town', 'life', ""n't"", 'provide', 'easy', 'answers', 'excess', 'sentiment', 'Look', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'small', 'early', 'role', 'bus', 'passenger']",The Stone Boy VHS
