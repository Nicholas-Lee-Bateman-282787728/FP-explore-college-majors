I sat through one evening of this hodgepodge and mishmash of dysfunctionalism promoting and glorifying teenage unwed pregnancy, divorce, adultery.....you name it!  Not to metion the over-the-top bad acting of Reba McEntire...(she needs to quit pretending she is Lucille Ball or Carol Burnett...mugging and trying to do slapstick comedy the way they did...).  McEntire tries too hard because of her tremendous ego.  The rest of the cast suffers because of her high toned antics and her attempts to steal every scene she is in because she doesn't want anyone to top her.  That said, the sitcom itself is degrading and an insult to those who want to influence our families with decent, quality programming which inspire and edify.  There are still ""functional"" families out there folks.  This show makes it seem like they're all passe'.  And I thought ""Rosanne"" was bad!

858318,A1LAAZUR8YFRW8,B000640WGM,"Barbara ""barbara11td""","[0, 0]","Reba is a very cute comedy based on the perils of Reba Hart, a mother of three in the throes of a divorce from her ex-husband, Brock, who is a dentist involved with quite a ditzy, but sometimes endearing hygenist.  As if the divorce was not enough to handle, Reba must also endure the issues that come with her eldest daughter who is pregnant and still in high school.  While the situation would have most fall to their knees, Reba seems to be able to manage and make things work better than most.  Barbara Jean, however, can make life very difficult and I am amazed at Reba's composure when dealing with this very absurd character.  Season 1 is full of laughs along with Season 2. Also,  I always wondered why  Reba's best friend, played by Park Overall, virtually disappeared without explanation.  Maybe to give more time to Barbara Jean and Reba's relationship, but it certainly seemed like a very loose end.  However, as the series progresses, it becomes less entertaining and more annoying due to the choices made and the children who seem to get left in the background as Cheyenne is always front and center and the one who seems to get all the attention from Reba.",4,"""Reba-licious!""",1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,1171,"['Reba', 'very', 'cute', 'comedy', 'based', 'perils', 'Reba', 'Hart', 'mother', 'three', 'throes', 'divorce', 'ex-husband', 'Brock', 'who', 'dentist', 'involved', 'ditzy', 'sometimes', 'endearing', 'hygenist', 'divorce', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'handle', 'Reba', 'must', 'also', 'endure', 'issues', 'come', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'who', 'pregnant', 'still', 'high', 'school', 'situation', 'would', 'have', 'most', 'fall', 'knees', 'Reba', 'be', 'able', 'manage', 'make', 'things', 'work', 'better', 'most', 'Barbara', 'Jean', 'however', 'can', 'make', 'life', 'very', 'difficult', 'am', 'amazed', 'Reba', 'composure', 'when', 'dealing', 'very', 'absurd', 'character', 'Season', '1', 'full', 'laughs', 'Season', '2', 'Also', 'always', 'wondered', 'why', 'Reba', 'best', 'friend', 'played', 'Park', 'Overall', 'virtually', 'disappeared', 'explanation', 'Maybe', 'give', 'more', 'time', 'Barbara', 'Jean', 'Reba', 'relationship', 'certainly', 'seemed', 'very', 'loose', 'end', 'However', 'series', 'less', 'entertaining', 'more', 'annoying', 'due', 'choices', 'made', 'children', 'who', 'seem', 'get', 'left', 'background', 'Cheyenne', 'always', 'front', 'center', 'one', 'who', 'get', 'attention', 'Reba']",N/A

But then, few suburban families have quite the chaos level that Reba's family does. A look at young marriage, impending divorce, reentering the singles life and ""other women,"" this is a surprisingly funny and touching show.Reba Hart (Reba McEntire) and her husband Brock (Christopher Rich) are separated due to his midlife crisis. But Reba receives a nasty shock when Brock announces that he's going to divorce her and marry his perky, dizzy assistant, Barbara Jean (Melissa Peterman) -- because she's pregnant. Even worse, Reba finds out that her daughter Cheyenne (Joanna Garcia) is also pregnant by hunky football-star boyfriend Van (Steve Howey).Things don't get much better after Brock moves out, and Van and Cheyenne get married. The newlyweds struggle with slimy in-laws and unforgiving schools, bare bottoms and morning sickness. And Reba has to deal with her disintegrating family, dumb blonde Barbara Jean, sullen teenager Kyra (Scarlett Pomers), wedding hysteria, and the daunting idea of dating new men after twenty years of marriage.The ""ordinary"" family is only present in bits and pieces in ""Reba"" -- we have the young newlyweds, the son-in-law, the nasty in-laws, the former wife, the new wife, the half-siblings, the grandkid, and the cheating husband. But in a time with high divorce rates, it seems to reflect the trials and tribulations of a family divided and patched together by divorce and family ties.Like all sitcoms, it takes weird situations and runs with them, like Cheyenne going into labor during graduation, or Reba accidently sewing her pants to Barbara Jean's wedding dress. It has quite a bit of physical and verbal humor; nothing too special, but quite funny anyhow.Reba McEntire makes this sitcom, with her flexible face and slightly wild physical humor, and is backed up in that by Peterman's wonderfully overdone Barbara Jean. Garcia and Howey have excellent chemistry as the ideal students-turned-teen-parents, and Rich is alternately slimy and endearing as Reba's semi-repentent ex.With its non-traditional family theme and McEntire's funny/heartwarming performances, ""Reba"" becomes a bit more than your average sitcom.

858342,A2Z60PVKWFO3SW,B000640WGM,"Learning All The Time ""It's Never Too Late to...","[2, 2]","I stumbled onto Reba a couple of weeks ago, surfing channels.  I actually stopped to watch b/c of Scarlett Pomers, who had a small recurring role on Star Trek Voyager, and b/c a friend of mine had raved about the show at a get together (and, I admit, we all laughed at her for watching it).  So I was just completely floored by how funny this show is.  It is a blend of ""I love Lucy"", ""Friends"", ""The Cosby Show"", and maybe a touch of ""Roseanne"" thrown in.  I am now a complete addict working my way through the DVD sets.All of the characters really work as sympathetic and interesting people, starting with Reba.  She is just perfect as the strong, somewhat harried mom trying to navigate all the unconventional changes life has thrown at her and her family.Then there are the two flaky teenagers in love, Cheyenne (Reba's daughter in the show) and Van (the football player who got her pregnant).  Making a ""dumb jock"" and a pregnant ""airheaded cheerleader""  appealing is a pretty tall order, but they totally pull this off - the proposal scene is one of the sweetest scenes I've ever seen.  I think what makes the idea of teen pregnancy palatable in this show is that the two so clearly adore each other, they are so completely in love and have a real relationship with each other - this is not casual ""hooking up"" or anyone taking advantage of anyone.  Van is kicked out of the house by his parents and bribed with a truck to return home and dump his teen bride, but instead he stands by the consequences of his actions and tries to make it work with the girl he loves.  We all know they'd fail without Reba standing behind them to help, and I guess some reviewers have quibbled with this, but to my way of thinking, this makes sense for this family.Then add in Reba's ex, Brock, a somewhat dim bulb, and his mistress/wife Barbara Jean who is even dimmer, who hang out around Reba's house and become a larger part of her life than she'd like.  Reba explains her tolerance for BJ as wanting her children to see their father, and BJ being part of the package, but it clearly helps that, as Reba also explains, no one can ever feel like they're the fool when BJ is around.  BJ is outrageous and funny and yet earnest too, she does things like buy Reba a tacky little angel cherub to make up for all the trouble she has caused, and asks for Reba's blessing before she marries Brock - and somehow this works, as crazy as it sounds on paper.  And there is one scene with Reba and BJ, when BJ confesses Brock is not the first married dentist she's ever slept with (there were lots of them) that is strangely poignant even as I laughed my head off.Reba's two younger children, Jake and Kyra, are also very capable and appealing.  Jake is just adorable and delivers his lines with wide-eyed earnestness, and Kyra, even as she fires off her snappy one-liners, doesn't have that distainful scowl (evident in later seasons) stamped on her face yet - she is still sweet and vulnerable at times, like before her father's wedding where she mourns the loss of the family as she knew it, and Reba comforts her.Somehow I've missed how Reba can stay in that huge, gorgeous home with no job other than to substitute teach a couple of times, that must be part of the divorce settlement.  And the fact she isn't working must be how she has time to be attentive to her family's needs and dispense wisdom and sarcasm as needed.  But I cheerfully suspend my disbelief about how any real family could live this way, in order to enjoy how this sitcom family manages to keep it all together.And now a few comments about Reba McIntire.  People have pretty strong opinions about her, she's had a long career and people have bumped into her country music at some point in their life.  They either love her or roll their eyes at her, which, I confess, I myself did up until 2 weeks ago, based on an opinion formed decades ago when I was in high school and loathed country music.So, as a newly converted fan of Reba, I urge you to forget anything you've ever thought you knew about Reba McIntire and look at her work with fresh eyes.  She is an incredibly talented, vibrant woman, and her work over the last decade has been a revelation to me.  She has excellent comedic timing and is so appealing in ""Reba"", and really pulls the whole show together.  She sings an ""Angels Lullaby"" at the end of the last episode that shocked prejudiced me with its beautiful expressiveness and prodded me to investigate the range of her singing even further.She performed on Broadway in 2001 in Annie Get Your Gun to rave reviews, and, based on clips I""ve seen on YouTube, those were well deserved.  She also starred in a concert performance of ""South Pacific"" at - I think Carnegie Hall - and she was just amazing as Nellie Forbush.  And her new Duets album contains great songs, including a gorgeous ballad with Justin Timberlake.Finally, she looks FABULOUS and modern, by any standard, not just one reserved for women in their 50s.Lots of performers ""reinvent"" themselves dramatically, but Reba hasn't done that as much as she's continued to evolve and grow with the times and opportunities that present themselves, and she does this with lots of contagious energy and enthusiasm.  She isn't mourning the ""glory days"", but forging ahead.  I am really looking forward to whatever her next project is.So anyway.  Oh, I know a lot of reviewers are calling this a family drama they can sit and watch with their whole family.  I do let my children watch this show, but the show may not be appropriate for all families, due to the adult situations it contains.  The show contains frank and sometimes irreverant references to sex, teen pregnancy, mistresses, infidelity, labor and delivery, skipping school, etc...  And there is mild swearing too.  Nevertheless, I think the show really emphasizes the most important family values -- loving and supporting each other, struggling to live with the consequences of your actions, and figuring out how to live a good, responsible life even when things don't go exactly like you planned.  And it does all this in a hilarious way.There are lots of extras on these DVDs, and they are all a real joy to watch.  There are actor commentaries on various episodes, a video on the making of Reba, and a wonderful backstage tour by Melissa Peterman (Barbara Jean), as well as bloopers.  The DVDs are also very well-priced!

Instead of the trial separation from her dentist husband Brock (Christopher Rich) ending in him moving back home, she learns that he has impregnated his dental hygienist Barbra Jean (Melissa Peterman).  As if that weren't bad enough, she also learns that her 17-year-old drill team captain daughter Cheyenne (Joanna Garcia) is also pregnant, courtesy of her boyfriend and the captain of the football team, Van Montgomery (Steve Howey).Naturally, this leads to lots of upheaval.  While Brock and Reba divorce so Brock can marry Barbra Jean, Cheyenne and Van get married and move in with Reba to finish their senior year of high school.  And Reba needs to keep it together for her two younger kids, smart and sarcastic Kyra (Scarlett Pomers), and six-year-old Jake (Mitch Holleman).Adultery, divorce, and teen pregnancy.  Have I mentioned yet that this is a comedy?As unlikely as it seems, it is.  And it really is very funny.  I started out not watching this show because I figured a show starring Reba couldn't be that good.  But I caught one late in the first season and fell in love.  Reba brings a warmth and humor to the part.  And I laugh my way through every one of the 22 episodes in this season.Being a sit com, some of the serious subjects dealt with come across a little too softly.  Consequences that might occur in real life are brought up, but all problems are solved in 22 minutes with laughs, jokes, and a hug or two.  I will admit at times that does bug me.  But it is the nature of the format.While the show calls itself a family sit com, this isn't a show I would let my kids watch by themselves.  There are occasional off color jokes.  Plus, the subject matter is very mature.  This is something I'd watch with older kids and use as a tool to open discussion of various issues brought up on the show.My other complaint about the season is Barbra Jean.  Here, they really play up her church attendance and Christianity.  And yet she doesn't seem to get the fact that she's an adulterer.  Fortunately, that is played down in later seasons.If you let this sit com go without watching, give it a chance.  You'll find great characters and funny situations that will have you laughing before you know what hit you.",5,Shockingly Funny Sit Com,1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,2305,"['Reba', 'Hart', 'Reba', 'McEntire', 'life', 'not', 'turning', 'out', 'way', 'had', 'planned', 'Instead', 'trial', 'separation', 'dentist', 'husband', 'Brock', 'Christopher', 'Rich', 'ending', 'moving', 'back', 'home', 'impregnated', 'dental', 'hygienist', 'Barbra', 'Jean', 'Melissa', 'Peterman', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'also', '17-year-old', 'drill', 'team', 'captain', 'daughter', 'Cheyenne', 'Joanna', 'Garcia', 'also', 'pregnant', 'courtesy', 'boyfriend', 'captain', 'football', 'team', 'Van', 'Montgomery', 'Steve', 'Howey', '.Naturally', 'lots', 'upheaval', 'Brock', 'Reba', 'divorce', 'so', 'Brock', 'can', 'marry', 'Barbra', 'Jean', 'Cheyenne', 'Van', 'get', 'married', 'move', 'Reba', 'finish', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'Reba', 'keep', 'together', 'two', 'younger', 'kids', 'smart', 'sarcastic', 'Kyra', 'Scarlett', 'Pomers', 'six-year-old', 'Jake', 'Mitch', 'Holleman', '.Adultery', 'divorce', 'teen', 'pregnancy', 'Have', 'mentioned', 'yet', 'comedy', 'As', 'unlikely', 'really', 'very', 'funny', 'started', 'out', 'not', 'watching', 'show', 'figured', 'show', 'starring', 'Reba', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'caught', 'one', 'late', 'first', 'season', 'fell', 'love', 'Reba', 'warmth', 'humor', 'part', 'laugh', 'way', 'one', '22', 'episodes', 'season.Being', 'sit', 'com', 'serious', 'subjects', 'dealt', 'come', 'little', 'too', 'softly', 'Consequences', 'might', 'occur', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'brought', 'up', 'problems', 'are', 'solved', '22', 'minutes', 'laughs', 'jokes', 'hug', 'two', 'will', 'admit', 'times', 'bug', 'nature', 'format.While', 'show', 'family', 'sit', 'com', ""n't"", 'show', 'would', 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'are', 'occasional', 'color', 'jokes', 'subject', 'matter', 'very', 'mature', 'something', ""'d"", 'watch', 'older', 'kids', 'use', 'tool', 'open', 'discussion', 'various', 'issues', 'brought', 'up', 'show.My', 'other', 'complaint', 'season', 'Barbra', 'Jean', 'Here', 'really', 'play', 'up', 'church', 'attendance', 'Christianity', 'yet', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'fact', 'adulterer', 'Fortunately', 'played', 'down', 'later', 'seasons.If', 'let', 'sit', 'com', 'go', 'watching', 'give', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'find', 'great', 'characters', 'funny', 'situations', 'will', 'have', 'laughing', 'know', 'what', 'hit']",N/A

But it was different, these people have problems and they'll try to get by.  Reba and Brock are divorced and moved in with his new girlfriend Barbara Jean and their child. Cheyenne there oldest is pregnant around seventeen and had a beautiful baby girl. Cheyenne is not the only teen mom I know, Where the Heart Is where Natalie Portman plays Novalee Nation a seventeen year old who just had a daughter Americus, The Gilmore Girls where Lauren Graham plays Lorelai Gilmore who had a daughter Rory when she was sixteen years old, Naomi Judd had Wynonna and Ashley when she was seventeen and twenty-one years old, Jennifer Moluf who had Cindy Crawford when she was eighteen years old. Joanna Garc&iacute;a has the greatest resemblance of Jessica Simpson. Steve Howey has the greatest resemblance of Chris Klein and Marc Blucas.  I look at Van and Cheyenne they're like the perfect couple, I always wanted to be like. They're like Jim and Michelle from American Pie.
