1229334,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001PR0Y6W,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 6]","When `I Love You, Man' first came out I rushed to the theater with my then best friend to see it.  We had the type of relationship that was very rare I think; a bond that was unlike any I had with anyone else and, to be honest, one I never want to have again (the closer you are the harder they hurt you).  Anyways, I'm not trying to be a downer, and I know that no one wants to hear this, but the reason I bring it up is this; when I left the theater that day I really, really loved this movie.  I was ready to give it a five-star blazing review.  Now that my then best friend and I are no longer speaking to one another I began to wonder if my adoration of this film was blinded love based on a personal connection I had with the subject matter.It wasn't.So that is why I mention my god-awful story of betrayed friendship, because in the end `I Love You, Man' still holds up, regardless of you current situation.  It is genuine, charming, authentic, original and very, very funny.The film tells of Peter Klaven; the `girlfriend guy'.  He never really had steady friendships because he's not like most men.  He's sweet and sensitive and emotional and caring and so he has a great track record with women, but when it comes down to selecting his bridal party (a guy that perfect can never stay single for long) he realizes that he has no friends.  So, he embarks on a quest to find a best man, and that is when he runs into Sydney Fife; the complete opposite of Peter.  He is crude and abrasive and a total womanizer and comfortable bachelor, but he possesses the same genuineness that Peter has.  Each man compliments the other, helping them edge out their own personalities and become more complete individuals.Why is writing this review making me so depressed?Anyways, the film is littered with very funny scenes and a lot of well placed humor, but the heart of this film takes a tenderer and even more serious tone of true friendship and that act of finding oneself for the first time.  The acting is very good all across the board, especially for this type of feature, but no one does as good a job at really reaching the audience as Paul Rudd.  Rudd is flawless here, really grabbing hold of the awkwardness of making friends, of being yourself while constantly trying to impress another person.  I know exactly what it's like to call up someone you don't really know but want to get to know (on a friendly level) and find yourself stammering through the most painfully awkward voice mail you've ever left.I'm telling you; he really is OSCAR worthy here, and that is not something you say very often about performances in this genre of film.Everything in this film feels so genuine because it is all so believable.  I remember looking at my then best friend throughout the film smiling and nudging him, saying ""this is so us"" and it was; yet sadly it wasn't.Friendship, and by that I mean TRUE FRIENDSHIP is a rarity today, and I'm thankful that someone finally broke the male bonding stereotype by making a film that is a true testament to the need for real friendship.  This is a very smart film that mixes the funny with the heart without ever overdoing it and without ever straying from its objective.  With a slew of nicely placed supporting performances (and a scene stealer by Andy Samberg), `I Love You, Man' is the complete package that will make you laugh and smile and, if you're me, cry.",5,The most bro-mantic movie ever...,1254441600,"10 2, 2009",2009,3405,"['When', 'Love', 'Man', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'rushed', 'theater', 'then', 'best', 'friend', 'see', 'had', 'type', 'relationship', 'was', 'very', 'rare', 'think', 'bond', 'was', 'had', 'anyone', 'else', 'be', 'honest', 'one', 'never', 'want', 'have', 'again', 'closer', 'are', 'harder', 'hurt', 'Anyways', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'downer', 'know', 'one', 'hear', 'reason', 'bring', 'up', 'when', 'left', 'theater', 'day', 'really', 'really', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'ready', 'give', 'five-star', 'blazing', 'review', 'Now', 'then', 'best', 'friend', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'speaking', 'one', 'began', 'wonder', 'adoration', 'film', 'was', 'blinded', 'love', 'based', 'personal', 'connection', 'had', 'subject', 'matter.It', ""wasn't.So"", 'why', 'mention', 'god-awful', 'story', 'betrayed', 'friendship', 'end', 'Love', 'Man', 'still', 'up', 'regardless', 'current', 'situation', 'genuine', 'charming', 'authentic', 'original', 'very', 'very', 'funny.The', 'film', 'tells', 'Peter', 'Klaven', 'girlfriend', 'guy', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'steady', 'friendships', 'not', 'most', 'men', 'sweet', 'sensitive', 'emotional', 'caring', 'so', 'great', 'track', 'record', 'women', 'when', 'down', 'selecting', 'bridal', 'party', 'guy', 'perfect', 'can', 'never', 'stay', 'single', 'long', 'friends', 'So', 'quest', 'find', 'best', 'man', 'when', 'Sydney', 'Fife', 'complete', 'opposite', 'Peter', 'crude', 'abrasive', 'total', 'womanizer', 'comfortable', 'bachelor', 'same', 'genuineness', 'Peter', 'man', 'other', 'helping', 'edge', 'out', 'own', 'personalities', 'become', 'more', 'complete', 'individuals.Why', 'writing', 'review', 'making', 'depressed', 'Anyways', 'film', 'littered', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes', 'lot', 'well', 'placed', 'humor', 'heart', 'film', 'tenderer', 'even', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'true', 'friendship', 'act', 'finding', 'first', 'time', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'board', 'especially', 'type', 'feature', 'one', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'really', 'reaching', 'audience', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Rudd', 'flawless', 'here', 'really', 'grabbing', 'hold', 'awkwardness', 'making', 'friends', 'being', 'constantly', 'trying', 'impress', 'person', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'call', 'up', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'want', 'get', 'know', 'friendly', 'level', 'find', 'stammering', 'most', 'painfully', 'awkward', 'voice', 'mail', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'left.I', ""'m"", 'telling', 'really', 'OSCAR', 'worthy', 'here', 'not', 'something', 'say', 'very', 'often', 'performances', 'genre', 'film.Everything', 'film', 'so', 'genuine', 'so', 'believable', 'remember', 'looking', 'then', 'best', 'friend', 'film', 'smiling', 'nudging', 'saying', 'so', 'was', 'yet', 'sadly', 'mean', 'TRUE', 'FRIENDSHIP', 'rarity', 'today', ""'m"", 'thankful', 'someone', 'finally', 'broke', 'male', 'bonding', 'stereotype', 'making', 'film', 'true', 'testament', 'need', 'real', 'friendship', 'very', 'smart', 'film', 'funny', 'heart', 'ever', 'overdoing', 'ever', 'straying', 'objective', 'slew', 'nicely', 'placed', 'supporting', 'performances', 'scene', 'stealer', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'Love', 'Man', 'complete', 'package', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'smile', ""'re"", 'cry']",N/A

I Love You, Man is a tidy, streamlined comedy that flows along smoothly from beginning to end without asking much of the viewer other than to sit back and be entertained.  It's also, a genuinely funny movie that creates a warm glow of male camraderie thanks to the effortless chemistry of it's two leads.  The plot is simple.  Paul Rudd is happily engaged to his fiance and is generally considered by her and her girlfiends to be the perfect boyfriend.  There's jost one little problem:  he doesn't have any guy friends.  Realizing that he needs a best man for his wedding, Rudd goes on an assortment of ""man-dates"" in an attempt at some much needed male bonding.  He finds his man-friend when he meets Sydney Fife, played by Segel.  The two bond over a shared love of Rush music and eventually, Rudd's character starts to spend more time with him than with his fiance.  This is not exactly a fresh, or innovative plot and you can see the ending coming a mile away.  But in the case of I Love You, Man, it's all about the journey.  Segel is hilarious as the overgrown man-child Sydney and Rudd is in fine form as well.  His attempts at establishg a laid back, guy rapport with Sydney often lead to some akwardly hilarious moments.  There are also funny supporting perfromances from Lou Ferrigno and John Favreau.  In the end it's not as funny, complicated or profound as an Apatow film, but that's because it isn't one.  It's just a fun, escapist, feel good comedy about the enduring friendships between guys.

She starts to comment on how odd that he doesn't have any friends. After a series of misadventures trying to find one, he finally meets up with Sydney (Jason Segal), with whom he really connects. A friendship is born. Inevitably this relationship starts to clash with his romantic one and stress is introduced where before there wasn't any. But everyone in the movie tries their best (there's no bad-guy role, except possibly that of Tevin), and approaches everything as adults. It's quite refreshing to see.There's a great deal of honesty to this movie, and as I mentioned, it's good to see characters acting like adults, without a lot of the cliches that one expects of films, particular those that touch on the ""Romantic Comedy"" genre.

This isn't due to social ineptitude, however; Peter gets along well with both sexes but primarily his sensitivity is attuned to friendships with women.  In order to seek out a best man aside from his gay brother (SNL's Andy Samberg) or father, Peter goes on several ""man dates"" in order to deepen his pool of males with whom to bond.  One man in particular, Forgetting Sarah Marshall's Jason Segel, appropriately fits the bill, and the two men embark on a friendship that forms the core of this movie.I Love You, Man explores an interesting facet of male relationships, an area often twisted in other movies into homosexual innuendo.  Fortunately, though, the story of I Love You, Man doesn't take this path, instead choosing to enlighten the viewer through crude humor, slapstick comedy, and witty discussion.  Though not written by Apatow, those who saw his aforementioned movies will undoubtedly enjoy what this movie brings to the table.  Rudd and Segel are a great comedy team; it's nice to see Rudd especially break out on his own.  There are several points throughout the movie where the ""man dates"" closely resemble heterosexual dates, and Rudd shows his acting skill at making the situation uncomfortable for both his character and the viewers.All in all, I Love You, Man is a solid comedy, closely following Knocked Up as a movie that can be enjoyed both by men who enjoy off-color humor, as well as women who will appreciate the emotional back-and-forth between the characters involved.

Zoe has a bunch of girl friends, Peter has no male friends. In fact, Peter is very creepy around guys; and is pretty darn clingy with Zoe (she really should have run and hidden when he served the hot chocolate to her girls night out). So Zoe kind of pushes Peter into finding some male friends and manning up. Peter's younger brother (Andy Samberg, SNL) is openly gay and advises Peter on how to get male friends. Eventually Peter runs into Stewart, (Jason Segel, How I Met Your Mother,Knocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition), andForgetting Sarah Marshall (Unrated Widescreen Edition)), and they quickly become friends. The movie moves into a form of love triangle at this point. Along the way, a lot of funny things happen. I really enjoyed Jon Favreau being the butt of many jokes in this film. Jamie Pressley (My name is Earl) was just outstanding in her directness.Please don't expect this film to be cinema, its just a good solid comedy, that will appeal to a mostly male audience. Jason Segel emits confidence in this film. After doing full frontal nudity in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, he seems to have nothing more to prove. Paul Rudd is good at being annoying early in the film - Mr. Clingy, Mr. eveything is too nice. He does a good job transitioning to a more likeable, normal character later in the film.There were a few good hommages to SNL and How I Met Your Mother (in the man cave, Stewart was frequently seen in front of Marshall amps). Funny, fake movie critic conversations. This is a pop culture / cinema literate film.At almost 2 hours, the film is just about the right lenght. Technically, surround sound was well used. There were a couple of bad edits where reaction shots were cut off early or changed too quickly. Shots were good and steady, no stupid random handheld camera movement. Overall, nicely done. The director, John Hamburg, has done mostly television; however this effort is very nicely done - way better than those credentials.The movie is definately rated R, and is not for younger viewers. There is no nudity in this film. The R rating is for strong language and explict discussions about sex. No violence, unless you count Lou Ferrigno putting Jason Segel in a sleeper hold. The jokes are crude.The DVD is packed with some nice bonus features. There is a commentary track with Jason Segel, Paul Rudd, and John Hamburg (I can only imagine that is very funny).Three deleted scenes that gratefully were left out of the movie (a rugby game, gay bowling, and groomsmen photo session) - they were bad.Extended scenes were actually really great - Rush fans, there is an extended version of the concert footage that is excellent; the discussion at ladies night is longer and cruder; the engagement dinner at the Chinese restaurant - Stewart talks about his job; Tuxedo shopping goes on a bit longer (not so good); Peter and Stewart hugging in front of the fountain gets another story thread added; and additional conversation at the wedding about gifts.Extras - a bunch of short clips that were in the film, but pushing the joke a lot further - a combination of extended scenes and out takes. Best watched long after seeing the movie, they kind of overplay the jokes.A making of featurette - forgettable.A good funny movie. There are moments when Peter made me feel uncomfortable with his stupid comments, he says things that he regrets or says without thinking. But overall, the jokes work well.",5,Very Funny,1250121600,"08 13, 2009",2009,3928,"['very', 'funny', 'movie', 'yeah', 'bit', 'guy', 'movie', 'well', 'maybe', 'lot', 'guy', 'movie', 'humor', 'very', 'crude', 'good', 'news', 'not', 'mean', 'funny', 'laughs', 'are', 'good', 'natured', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'be', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'films.Peter', 'Klaven', 'Paul', 'Rudd', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'OH', 'Ohio', 'andForgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'engaged', 'Zoe', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'Office', 'Television', 'series', 'Zoe', 'bunch', 'girl', 'friends', 'Peter', 'male', 'friends', 'fact', 'Peter', 'very', 'creepy', 'guys', 'pretty', 'darn', 'clingy', 'Zoe', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'run', 'hidden', 'when', 'served', 'hot', 'chocolate', 'girls', 'night', 'out', 'So', 'Zoe', 'kind', 'pushes', 'Peter', 'finding', 'male', 'friends', 'manning', 'up', 'Peter', 'younger', 'brother', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'SNL', 'openly', 'gay', 'Peter', 'how', 'get', 'male', 'friends', 'Eventually', 'Peter', 'Stewart', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'andForgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Unrated', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'quickly', 'become', 'friends', 'movie', 'form', 'love', 'triangle', 'point', 'way', 'lot', 'funny', 'things', 'happen', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'being', 'butt', 'many', 'jokes', 'film', 'Jamie', 'Pressley', 'name', 'Earl', 'was', 'just', 'outstanding', 'directness.Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'be', 'cinema', 'just', 'good', 'solid', 'comedy', 'will', 'appeal', 'mostly', 'male', 'audience', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'confidence', 'film', 'doing', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'have', 'nothing', 'more', 'prove', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'good', 'being', 'annoying', 'early', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Clingy', 'Mr.', 'eveything', 'too', 'nice', 'good', 'job', 'transitioning', 'more', 'likeable', 'normal', 'character', 'later', 'film.There', 'were', 'few', 'good', 'hommages', 'SNL', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'man', 'cave', 'Stewart', 'was', 'frequently', 'seen', 'front', 'Marshall', 'amps', 'Funny', 'fake', 'movie', 'critic', 'conversations', 'pop', 'culture', '/', 'cinema', 'literate', 'film.At', 'almost', '2', 'hours', 'film', 'just', 'right', 'lenght', 'Technically', 'surround', 'sound', 'was', 'well', 'used', 'were', 'couple', 'bad', 'edits', 'where', 'reaction', 'shots', 'were', 'cut', 'off', 'early', 'changed', 'too', 'quickly', 'Shots', 'were', 'good', 'steady', 'stupid', 'random', 'handheld', 'camera', 'movement', 'Overall', 'nicely', 'done', 'director', 'John', 'Hamburg', 'done', 'mostly', 'television', 'however', 'effort', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'way', 'better', 'credentials.The', 'movie', 'definately', 'rated', 'R', 'not', 'younger', 'viewers', 'nudity', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'strong', 'language', 'explict', 'discussions', 'sex', 'violence', 'count', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'putting', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'sleeper', 'hold', 'jokes', 'are', 'crude.The', 'DVD', 'packed', 'nice', 'bonus', 'features', 'commentary', 'track', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'John', 'Hamburg', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'very', 'funny', '.Three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gratefully', 'were', 'left', 'movie', 'rugby', 'game', 'gay', 'bowling', 'groomsmen', 'photo', 'session', 'were', 'bad.Extended', 'scenes', 'were', 'actually', 'really', 'great', 'Rush', 'fans', 'extended', 'version', 'concert', 'footage', 'excellent', 'discussion', 'ladies', 'night', 'longer', 'cruder', 'engagement', 'dinner', 'Chinese', 'restaurant', 'Stewart', 'talks', 'job', 'Tuxedo', 'shopping', 'bit', 'longer', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'Peter', 'Stewart', 'hugging', 'front', 'fountain', 'story', 'thread', 'added', 'additional', 'conversation', 'wedding', 'gifts.Extras', 'bunch', 'short', 'clips', 'were', 'film', 'pushing', 'joke', 'lot', 'further', 'combination', 'extended', 'scenes', 'out', 'Best', 'watched', 'long', 'seeing', 'movie', 'kind', 'overplay', 'jokes.A', 'making', 'featurette', 'forgettable.A', 'good', 'funny', 'movie', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'Peter', 'made', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'stupid', 'comments', 'things', 'thinking', 'overall', 'jokes', 'work', 'well']",N/A
1229360,A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,B001PR0Y6W,Danny G.,"[1, 1]","The United States, in general, is quite a homophobic country. Men are expected to have platonic feelings of love only for immediate family members, such as parents, grandparents, siblings and their own offspring. Sharing one's nonsexual feelings of love outside this tiny world is basically considered taboo. In other cultures this is certainly not the case, something I had the good fortune to experience first hand!""I Love You, Man"" does a superb job of comparing and contrasting heterosexual women's emotionally rich, same-sex friendships with heterosexual men's typically barren, same-sex friendships. It exposes the hypocrisy that it's okay for women to hug and be emotionally close and talk in graphic details about their sex lives amongst themselves, but NOT for a man to do the same exact thing!What a refreshing and insightful film! This brilliant story also compares male homosexual and heterosexual same-sex relationships and on the surface, at least, they are indistinguishable! This might be news to some people - but all well-adjusted human beings have a yearning for emotionally rewarding relationships!And, one person can not fulfill ALL your emotional needs! It's really that simple!Thank you Hollywood for taking such a risk in making such a profound film with a great sense of humor!

Much to my surprise he has no connection to this wonderful flick whatsoever.  The mastermind behind this latter day comedy classic is John Hamburg who a decade ago wrote the brilliant ""Meet the Parents""(and it's unfortunate sequel).  The best comedies tap into some eternal, sometime painful, truths.  In this case it's what if you enter a certain point in life and discover that you don't have a best friend of the same gender.  Director-writer examines this possibility with comic poignance and tenderness, raunchy and crude lingo aside.  Paul Rudd is a throwback to vintage cinema, Jimmy Stewart coming to mind, playing the everyman who finds himself in this dilemna.  Jason Segel can hang with me anytime.

1229363,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001PR0Y6W,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","In 2009, the bromance film known as ""I LOVE YOU, MAN"" was well-received by the critics and further establishing the comedic careers of Paul Rudd (""Knocked Up"", ""Night at the Museum"", ""The 40 Year Old Virgin and ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") and Jason Segel (""How I Met Your Mother"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""Knocked Up"").  The two have worked together in several well-known comedy films and as David Spade and Chris Farley were in the 90's, both Rudd and Segel are managing to do quite well as a comedy team when together.The film is written and directed by John Hamburg (""Along Came Polly"", ""Meet the Parents"", Meet the Fockers"" and ""Zoolander"") and co-written by Larry Levin (""It's Garry Shandling's Show"", ""Seinfeld"" and the first two ""Doctor Dolittle"" films).  The film's music is composed by Theodore Shapiro (""Mr. Woodcock"", ""Semi-Pro"" and ""Marley & Me"") and cinematography by Lawrence Sher (""Garden State"", ""Legally Blonde"" and ""The Dukes of Hazzard"").VIDEO & AUDIO:""I LOVE YOU, MAN"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  The picture quality is vibrant and outdoor and also indoor scenes are full of color.  Fine detail is quite good boasting well-defined edges and revealing the textures from the home of Peter and Zooey to the instruments and products inside Sydney's home.  But it's the beauty of what we see outdoors, at the beach and throughout Los Angeles, just a great job of capturing that Angelino life courtesy of Director of Photography Lawrence Sher.Skintones are well-done, black levels are good and picture quality is sharp, clear and overall a film to expect a broad spectrum of colors.  I didn't notice any artifacting or banding or source noise as well.As for the audio, ""I LOVE YOU, MAN"" is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD (and also French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The soundtrack featured is dialogue driven and is crisp and clear and for the most part, the film is front and center channel driven.  If anything, most bass will come from the music segments.  From the RUSH concert or musical soundtrack, this is not a film to expect an aggressive mix but there are some scenes such as Peter and Sydney jamming on the guitar and bass which come alive through your system.  But for the most part, the film is a dialogue-driven film.As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""I LOVE YOU, MAN"" comes with the following special features:* Audio Commentary by Director John Hamburg, Paul Rudd and Jason Segel - Hilarious audio commentary and listening to the three, needless to say that things do get crazy but also you get a good idea of the various improvisation that went on to making the film.  Also, interesting tidbits on the vomit scene, the RUSH concert and more.  Very entertaining commentary!* The Making of ""I Love You, Man"" - (17:29) Interviews with the cast and crew about being part of the film, working together, how the vomit scene was created and also filming the RUSH concert scene.* Extras- (22:25) The film features a lot of improvising and thus, this featurette focuses on several scenes throughout the film and showing the viewer of how many improvise scenes there were and many takes of the film.* Extended Scenes (12:39) - There are six extended scenes included on the special features.  Included are: Ladies Night, Engagement Dinner, Tuxedo Shopping, The Grove, Rush Concert and The Wedding* Deleted Scenes - (3:18)  There are a total of three deleted scenes.  Included are: The Lost Man Date - Rugby, Gay Bowling League Night and Groomsmen Photo Session* Gag Reel - (11:25) My favorite special feature is the gag reel.  Absolutely hilarious and what I enjoy about it is the length of the gag reel at over 10 minutes.* Red Brand Trailer - (2:49) Red Brand trailer of ""I LOVE YOU, MAN"" which includes profanity.JUDGMENT CALL:""I LOVE YOU, MAN"" was an enjoyable and hilarious bromance film.It's one of those films where a guy will know people similar to the character of Peter, a guy typically with mostly female friends and hardly any guy friends.  Granted, the character and bromance between Peter and Sydney is a bit more extreme but for the most part, I have had friends who have been in similar situations as these characters and thus, I found those situations quite hilarious and fun!Both Paul Rudd and Jason Segel have developed a good chemistry for comedy films.  Several years ago, I was raving about Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd but as of late, Rudd and Segel are are a good pairing.  Both having worked on ""Knocked Up"" and ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", those familiar with those two films can easily know what kind of antics and craziness they will get with ""I LOVE YOU, MAN"".Also, ""I LOVE YOU, MAN"" sports an awesome supporting cast.  I have always wanted to see more of Rashida Jones (""The Office"") and it was great to see her in a major role like this.  Also, to see Jaime Pressly, Jon Favreau, Jane Curtin, J.K. Simmons and Andy Samberg all together in one film was also very cool!  If anything, I just enjoyed the sincerity and realness of both Zooey and Peter but then you have this cast around them that are a bit off.  Everything just worked.Even certain man talk from the observance of a guy's reaction (during the real estate showing).  Another example, is Peter who tries to say something in Jamaican but it all comes out Irish or another small instance of Peter asking for his DVD box set back for a copy of ""LOST"" Season 2.  There are just these small things that just make you smile because these are normal day things that people experience that you just don't see in film.  So, I enjoyed that!And the Blu-ray High Definition transfer also added to the enjoyability of the film because the transfer looks pretty awesome and although this is not a film that utilizes extensive sound effects, the lossless audio track was pretty solid for a comedy film like ""I LOVE YOU, MAN"".  And of course, the special features included.. it's great to see the improvisational cuts and seeing how creative the talent got to be with their words.Overall, ""I LOVE YOU, MAN"" is not the greatest comedy but it was highly entertaining, hilarious and 104 minutes of all-out fun!  For those looking for a comedy on Blu-ray, this film is definitely recommended!",4,"Blu-ray: The popular ""Bromance"" film gets a pretty cool HD transfer and many fun bonus features!",1249948800,"08

1229364,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B001PR0Y6W,D. Hartley,"[1, 1]","Humorist Matt Groening once observed: ""Sex is funny. The French are a funny people. Then why is it that no French sex comedies are funny?"" On the other hand, you have Roger Ebert, who once lamented about ""a trend in which Hollywood buys French comedies and experiments on them to see if they can be made into English with all the humor taken out."" I generally concur with both those sentiments, but I think I have found the exception to Groening's and Ebert's rules- in the guise of a smart, funny and warm French comedy (""Mon Meilleur Ami"" which I thought was one of the better films of 2007), that has inspired an equally smart, funny and warm American remake.Paul Rudd stars as Peter Klaven, a somewhat self-effacing yet amiably good-natured Los Angeles real estate agent who has decided to pop the question to his ladylove, Zooey (Rashida Jones). The bubbly Zooey immediately begins enthusiastically phoning up a bevy of close girlfriends to share the happy news. When she asks her new fianc&eacute; why he isn't jumping right on the horn to tell all his pals as well, he mumbles some vague excuse and appears eager to change the subject. It turns out that while Peter is adept at meeting women, he is more diffident when it comes to interacting with other guys; he can't readily name anyone who qualifies as a ""bro"", nor can he seem to cough up a candidate to be Best Man at their wedding. Someone is going to have to come up with an Action Plan.Desperate to find himself a good bud on such short notice, Peter seeks assistance from his gay brother (SNL's Andy Samberg), who happily sets him up on some ""man dates"". Zooey pitches in as well, helpfully brokering a ""poker night"" invite for Peter from her best friend's reluctant husband (a skulking Jon Favreau, hilariously effective here playing a supreme jerk). Most of these intros and invites end in embarrassment and/or some form of social disaster. Just when all seems lost, a Dude ex Machina arrives in the form of a free-spirited man child named Sydney Fife (Jason Segel). Teach me to dance, Zorba.In its best moments (and this is high praise), I was reminded of Barry Levinson's ""Diner"", which I consider the granddaddy of all modern ""bro-mantic"" comedies, as well as one of the most keenly perceptive observations about male friendship ever put on screen. I think it's interesting to note that screenwriter Larry Levin (who co-scripted with director John Hamburg) also wrote a classic 2-part Seinfeld episode called ""The Boyfriend"", in which Jerry develops a ""man crush"" on one of the N.Y. Mets (this film could be seen as an extrapolation on that theme). In its worst moments, the film threatens to lean on that tiresome crutch of cheap gross-out humor that has largely put me off of contemporary ""comedies"", but thankfully, the reins are judiciously pulled in (Woody Allen has managed to make tons of funny films over a 40 year period without one scene involving projectile vomiting-so why can't the current crop of comedy directors learn from this?).Rudd and Segel play off each other extremely well, and are obviously developing a solid comedy duo franchise. Rudd continues to perfect an onscreen persona as the quintessential post-modern comic Everyman. I thought Segel's performance strongly recalled Donal Logue's slovenly yet endearing self-styled hipster saint wannabe in ""The Tao of Steve"". Thomas Lennon (best known as ""Lieutenant Dangle"" from the wonderfully twisted comedy series, Reno 911) is a riot as a love struck stalker (no spoilers, please). Lou Ferrigno (as himself) is an unexpected delight, unveiling some previously hidden comic chops, and air guitar geeks will swoon at the cameo appearance by the Holy Trinity of Canadian prog-rock.

1229367,ABC4LIDMGUYM9,B001PR0Y6W,Dorothy,"[3, 4]","I love this movie! ""I Love You, Man"" takes place in Los Angeles, California in present day starring the delightful Paul Rudd, Rashida Jones, and Jason Segal. Paul Rudd plays the character Peter Klaven, who is rather reserved and doesn't have many friends, which never seems to faze him until he proposes to the love of his life, Zooey Rice. Zooey has two best friends who she has had forever; Denise, played by Jamie Pressley and Hailey played by Sarah Burns. Zooey, Denise, and Hailey have a bunch of friends together that one night a week they host girls' night at each other's houses. During one of those girls nights, after Peter proposes to Zooey, Peter walks into Zooey and friends discussing how Peter not only doesn't have a best friend but he doesn't have any friends, therefore he most likely won't have a best man for their June wedding. Upset and embarrassed, Peter is on a mission to find friends or a best man. He seeks help through his brother Robbie, played by the hysterical, Andy Samberg, and through the help of his mom, played by the lovely Jane Curtain. The ""friends"" his mom and brother find for Peter are amusing and completely out there. But, out of nowhere he eventually finds Sydney Fife, played by Jason Segal. Peter and Sydney become fast friends and their relationship is truly great. In a way, they are complete opposites, Peter being more reserved, self conscious and having low self esteem, whereas Sydney being quite odd in his strange outfits such as shorts and ugg boots in the middle of June in California, and living a more carefree lifestyle just being who he is and not caring what people say and think of him.I think the acting is great and I love the pairing of Paul Rudd and Jason Segal. Paul Rudd is funny and charming and plays a fiance that every girl dreams to have. Jason Segal is fun, crazy and very entertaining. They play off each other really well throughout the film. The beautiful Rashida Jones, Jon Favreau and Tom Lennon light up the screen.I think Peter learns a lot from Sydney and I think after spending more time with him he starts to finally be more comfortable in his own skin and more confident with his work and relationships. Could Sydney be Peter's best man in the wedding just around the corner? I guess you have to see for yourself in this bro-mantic comedy!

1229370,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001PR0Y6W,Ed Uyeshima,"[27, 31]","At the core of what looks on the surface to be a standard summer buddy movie is an intriguing premise: What does become of the overly sensitized male when confronted with the reality that all his closest friends are female and that he is at a complete loss to find any groomsmen, in particular, a best man, for his wedding? It's not an earth-shattering dilemma to address, yet the situation gives rise to a lot of amusing questions about what constitutes masculine behavior in our supposedly evolved society. Fortunately, director/co-writer John Hamburg (Along Came Polly) has fashioned a 2009 comedy (with co-writer Larry Levin) full of shrewd observations and hilarious gags that transcend formula and elevate the story into something fresh and genuinely likeable.When sweet-natured L.A. real estate broker Peter Klaven decides to marry Zooey, his girlfriend of eight months, it dawns on both of them that he has no close male friends. Whispers about his manhood and her fear of him being too clingy as a husband lead Peter to set up a series of disastrous man-dates, one being the predictable mistaken gay date. However, it's at an open house at Lou Ferrigno's manse that he meets his personality opposite - Sydney Fife, a slovenly, blunt albeit socially observant slacker. As it turns out, their differences complement one another in a way that makes them best buddies almost from the get-go - that and a common obsession for the 1970's power band Rush. Naturally, Zooey starts to resent Sydney's burgeoning role in Peter's life - and things get complicated before the inevitable conclusion.Two of Judd Apatow's familiar rep company star. Finally at the center of a major movie, Paul Rudd is ideally cast as Peter since the role takes advantage of how he combines his boyish charm and unpredictable nebbishness into a memorable character. In fact, he manages to give Peter's awkward attempts to overcome his social anxiety a certain emotional resonance. We feel every painful step he takes in replicating Sydney's free spirit, and it becomes easy to root for his success. Much better cast here than as the self-conscious lead in last year'sForgetting Sarah Marshall, Jason Segel offers his doughy likeability to a role that suits his casual, lumbering personality, even when he exposes an intimate secret between Peter and Zooey in a wedding party dinner toast.If the interplay between Rudd and Segel feels familiar from Apatow comedies likeThe 40-Year-Old VirginandKnocked Up, it is a coincidence that Hamburg takes full advantage of to keep the movie comically involving. Rashida Jones brings a raspy appeal to Zooey, although she is kept mostly at the sidelines. Also underused are Jaime Pressly as Zooey's tart-tongued friend Denise and as Peter's parents, J.K. Simmons (playing the same wiseass father he played inJuno) and especially Jane Curtin. Jon Favreau has a thankless role as Denise's alpha-male jerk of a husband, while Andy Samberg makes a most unconvincing gay as Peter's sleep-around, personal trainer brother. There are plenty of laughs throughout its slightly long 105-minute running time, but what may surprise you is the number of insightful moments that this affectionate, satirical comedy provides.",4,The Comical Fate of the Sensitive Male,1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,3225,"['core', 'what', 'surface', 'be', 'standard', 'summer', 'buddy', 'movie', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'What', 'become', 'overly', 'sensitized', 'male', 'when', 'confronted', 'reality', 'closest', 'friends', 'are', 'female', 'complete', 'loss', 'find', 'groomsmen', 'particular', 'best', 'man', 'wedding', 'not', 'earth-shattering', 'dilemma', 'address', 'yet', 'situation', 'rise', 'lot', 'amusing', 'questions', 'what', 'masculine', 'behavior', 'supposedly', 'evolved', 'society', 'Fortunately', 'director/co-writer', 'John', 'Hamburg', 'Along', 'Came', 'Polly', 'fashioned', '2009', 'comedy', 'co-writer', 'Larry', 'Levin', 'full', 'shrewd', 'observations', 'hilarious', 'gags', 'transcend', 'formula', 'elevate', 'story', 'something', 'fresh', 'genuinely', 'likeable.When', 'sweet-natured', 'L.A.', 'real', 'estate', 'broker', 'Peter', 'Klaven', 'marry', 'Zooey', 'girlfriend', 'eight', 'months', 'close', 'male', 'friends', 'Whispers', 'manhood', 'fear', 'being', 'too', 'clingy', 'husband', 'lead', 'Peter', 'set', 'up', 'series', 'disastrous', 'man-dates', 'one', 'being', 'predictable', 'mistaken', 'gay', 'date', 'However', 'open', 'house', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'manse', 'personality', 'opposite', 'Sydney', 'Fife', 'slovenly', 'blunt', 'albeit', 'socially', 'observant', 'slacker', 'out', 'differences', 'complement', 'one', 'way', 'best', 'buddies', 'almost', 'get-go', 'common', 'obsession', '1970', 'power', 'band', 'Rush', 'Naturally', 'Zooey', 'resent', 'Sydney', 'burgeoning', 'role', 'Peter', 'life', 'things', 'get', 'complicated', 'inevitable', 'conclusion.Two', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'familiar', 'rep', 'company', 'star', 'Finally', 'center', 'major', 'movie', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'ideally', 'cast', 'Peter', 'role', 'advantage', 'how', 'boyish', 'charm', 'unpredictable', 'nebbishness', 'memorable', 'character', 'fact', 'give', 'Peter', 'awkward', 'overcome', 'social', 'anxiety', 'certain', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'feel', 'painful', 'step', 'replicating', 'Sydney', 'free', 'spirit', 'easy', 'root', 'success', 'Much', 'better', 'cast', 'here', 'self-conscious', 'lead', 'last', ""year'sForgetting"", 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'doughy', 'likeability', 'role', 'suits', 'casual', 'lumbering', 'personality', 'even', 'when', 'intimate', 'secret', 'Peter', 'Zooey', 'wedding', 'party', 'dinner', 'interplay', 'Rudd', 'Segel', 'feels', 'familiar', 'Apatow', 'comedies', 'likeThe', '40-Year-Old', 'VirginandKnocked', 'Up', 'coincidence', 'Hamburg', 'full', 'advantage', 'keep', 'movie', 'comically', 'involving', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'raspy', 'appeal', 'Zooey', 'kept', 'mostly', 'sidelines', 'Also', 'underused', 'are', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'Zooey', 'tart-tongued', 'friend', 'Denise', 'Peter', 'parents', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'playing', 'same', 'wiseass', 'father', 'played', 'inJuno', 'especially', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'thankless', 'role', 'Denise', 'alpha-male', 'jerk', 'husband', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'most', 'unconvincing', 'gay', 'Peter', 'sleep-around', 'personal', 'trainer', 'brother', 'are', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'slightly', 'long', '105-minute', 'running', 'time', 'what', 'may', 'surprise', 'number', 'insightful', 'moments', 'affectionate', 'satirical', 'comedy']",N/A

When I was in high school, my best friend and I had that exact same conversation, showing how pathetic boys are...yet how powerful are the bonds of the love beween two guys who are best friends. It's a bond I remember well.This film went beyond my understanding, a generational thing. It's filled with middle-aged men calling one another ""dude"", yet it is the funniest, wittiest film I've watched in years. Ruud's performance is so Oscar-worthy and is a sad reminder that the Academy doesn't really give Oscars for this kind of thing anymore.Woody Allen invented this genre, the often rapid-fire repartee, the subtle in-jokes of a generation, the cultural references and the melancholy nostalgia for high school. The main character's desperate search for a best friend (in order to have the best friend be his best man at his wedding) is reminiscent of the high school nostalgia.But this man, beautifully played by Ruud--has never had friends. Insulting acquaintances, well, he could have written a book on that. This made me identify with the film.Much more importantly, this film truly is about love and its healing power. In accidentally stumbling across the man who will end up being his best friend, Ruud suffers from his annoying acquaintances, his selfish fiancee, and his bumbling man-dates. I thought the film could have benefitted from a few more funny man-date scenes, but that's just me.This movie is simply too funny to review in a detailed way, and the story is too beautifully simple to describe.

The low ratings seem to be for the language mostly, and the sexually charged themes.  I can agree that the language was a bit harsh and crude, however this is to be expected with this movie given the actors, summary and rating.  I was just glad it didn't have pointless nudity and there were some wholesome themes too.  It wasn't all bad.The high ratings are given because this is a movie in comedic similarity to ""40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Superbad"".  I was not impressed by either of those movies, I thought Superbad was just painful, but I personally would not compare this movie to those given the themes.Overall, I would say this movie is at the C grade level.

In other words, he has nobody to be the best man at his wedding.  With the help of family, Peter takes the effort to find one.  Cue the man-dates.His man-dating pairs him up with a soccer fanatic, who for some reason can't control the pitch of his voice, and then there's Doug (Thomas Lennon from `Reno 911'), the man who decides to kiss on the first date.  Peter abandons all hope, that is until he meets Sydney Fife (Jason Segal).  With Sydney, Peter gains a friend and brotherly companionship, but it comes at a cost to his love relationship.""I Love You, Man"" is a `bromantic' comedy, but behind all the `bromance' and dude lingo, etc, comes an overtone of warmth and genuine humor.  The film is filled with awkward male bonding scenes that Segal and Rudd played out to perfection.  They deserve credit when credit is due, but also you must acknowledge the supporting cast, as they are also responsible for some of the laughs.  Look for cameos from Jon Favreau, J.K.

1229384,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001PR0Y6W,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","O my stars and garters, this is one movie you shouldn't see with your mom. I LOVE YOU, MAN wallows in vulgarity and in plonking its central character in extremely awkward social situations. But, it turns out, providing your muscles don't cramp up from cringing so much from the sheer barrage of inappropriate, then you just might connect with the charm and sweetness at the core of the film. But, yes, first, there's that gauntlet of raunchy to absorb.This film wouldn't have worked as well (or maybe at all) without Paul Rudd, who delivers another standout performance. Rudd plays Peter Klaven, a Los Angeles real estate agent who'd just become engaged to his girlfriend Zooey (Rashida Jones, beautiful). All his life Peter's been one of those cats who'd just naturally gravitated towards female buds, a fact which doesn't go unremarked with Zooey's circle of girlfriends. One evening, while making root beer floats (with, get this, something called pirouette chocolate straws) Peter overhears them making fun of him, and I think the clincher may have been when one girl warns Zooey that Peter's lack of male buddies may later warp into clinginess. Or maybe the clincher is when Zooey tells her girls: ""I honestly think that his best friend is his mom."" Peter realizes that he's not even close enough to any dude to ask to be Best Man at his wedding. So he sets out to meet new friends, dudes this time. And, oh, it's so painful to watch. But, so very funny, also.I remember someone comparing Paul Rudd to Hugh Grant in the sense that they're both these normal schmoes we can all relate to, and yet both have enough quirkiness and wit and a knack for wryly delivering a line that make them stand out. Paul Rudd's take on his character here is something worth checking out, his awkward attempts to identify with his more macho brethren. There's a finesse in how Rudd dives into his character, more nuance in his performance than, say, in Jason Segel's. Jason's character is more earthy and boisterous and quite oblivious to what's socially acceptable. Frankly, that's the less challenging role. Rudd has the trickier part. His uncool, buttoned-down, put-upon character is forced into going on these man dates, and there's a horrible wince factor as the poor dude strives desperately but fails spectacularly at bonding with the homies. And yet he has to remain likeable enough that we don't abandon him. Paul Rudd is very good at this. And I like that his character's playing around with foreign accents every time comes out sounding leprechaunish.Rudd and Segel demonstrate good chemistry together, and they do a job and a half selling this odd couple friendship to us. In fact, this is a good cast, across the board. Rashida Jones, in a way, is the third wheel in this mess. I LOVE YOU, MAN is predominantly a bromance, with the traditional guy-girl romance taking a back seat. Still, Rashida Jones is great as the understanding girlfriend whose understanding gradually erodes. Segel's character, oddball but strangely cool Sydney Fife, proceeds to get on Zooey's last nerve, even as he and Peter get tighter. So the dilemma becomes, what do you do when your fiancee and your best friend don't get along?  J.K. Simmons (reliably terrific), Andy Samberg, Jon Favreau, and Jaime Pressly round out the cast, and they're all fine. I'm especially loving Jon Favreau's turn as an insufferably jerky husband. And Lou Ferrigno steps in for an awesome cameo.Awkward, so awkward. And funny. And sweet. And the cussing. Those are the lasting impressions. If you can handle the eff bombs and the off-color stuff, then you'll get to the part where there's a sweet relationship, not only between the guy and the girl, but between the guy and the guy (in a straight, beer guzzling, Rush-digging kind of way).""Exit the warrior, today's Tom Sawyer...""

But as he starts thinking about who he's going to ask to be his best man and groomsmen he realizes that he doesn't really have any male friends. Not knowing how to really talk to guys he asks his gay brother, Robbie (Andy Samberg), what he should do, and Robbie suggests going on ""Man Dates."" After several awkward ""Man Dates,"" Peter meets Sydney Fife (Jason Segel) at an open house he's running to sell Lou Ferrigno's (himself) home. Sydney, someone looking for a friend as his friends all get married and immersed in work, turns out to be just the friend that Peter needs as he introduces him to the world of ""mandom"" and they bond over Rush.Since the summer of 2005, the rated R comedy has had a major resurgence. Since then we've seen Wedding Crashers, 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Step Brothers, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, Role Models, and then this year The Hangover. Of course, this resurgence was led by uber-Producer Judd Apatow, but there have been a few filmmakers that have made movies that have proved that Apatow isn't the only filmmaker with a hand in on this type of comedy including David Wain, Kevin Smith, and Todd Philips. Now, John Hamburg (who worked with Apatow on his TV show, Undeclared), with his first feature film since 2004's Along Came Polly, tries to join their ranks and join in on this R-rated revolution.Let me get this out of the way: I Love You, Man is a romantic comedy. No, it's not about boy meets girl, but it does follow the tropes of a romantic comedy, and in a movie like this it works to great affect. Of course, some of the jokes are played as gay jokes, one of the great things that they've done though is to give the movie great gay characters to avoid being considered homophobic. In particular, Robbie is one of the most unstereotypically gay characters I've ever seen in film. That's what makes this film though, great characterization. These characters act and feel real, they're truly empathetic characters, and when the comedy comes we laugh because it's genuine, even if a lot of it is borne from Peter's awkwardness. And when the comedy does come, it comes hard, and feels fresh.Typically in a lot of comedies, especially romantic comedies, it's not really fair to talk about the acting. While this movie does follow the romantic comedy ""guidelines,"" it's not your typically romantic comedy and includes a who's who list of comedic royalty. Not only do you have Paul Rudd, who was better known for his dramatic work before Anchorman, and Jason Segel, writer and star of Forgetting Sarah Marshall as well as Marshall from How I Met Your Mother, but you also have Andy Samberg (SNL, Cloudy With a chance of Meatballs), Rashida Jones (Parks and Recreation, Cop Out), Jon Favreau (Swingers, as well as the director of Elf and Iron Man), Jaime Pressly (My Name is Earl, Not Another Teen Movie), Joe Lo Truglio (Reno 911, Role Models), Thomas Lennon (Reno 911, The State), and you can't forget Jane Curtin (SNL Alumni, 3rd Rock From the Sun) and JK Simmons (Thank You For Smoking, Juno). But the movie truly would work if it weren't for Rudd and Segel, they have the perfect chemistry for this ""bromance.""If I had to fault the movie for anything it would be that the plotline is generic. I Love You, Man doesn't really deviate from the general romantic comedy outline, but I also believe that was meant to be on purpose. There hasn't really been a true ""bromance"" movie, just movies that allude to bromances, but recently there's been a lot of talk about bromance, and this movie chose to exploit it, and it does a great job. I think in order to make a good movie about straight guys ""hooking up"" you had to follow this outline. The main problem this leads to is the ""break up"" point of the typical romantic comedy here feels a little forced. Yeah, it's got some great comedy surrounding that moment (the billboards are genius, and if you haven't seen it, you'll know what I'm talking about), but it seemed like too little to really set off the break up, and should have resulted in a somewhat quicker make up (although the make up is also genius). But this is just a small hiccupin an otherwise great movie.I highly recommend this movie. In my opinion, after rewatching a few comedies from 2009, this is my favorite (even moreso than The Hangover) and would fall into my top 5 favorite movies of the year. Trust me, if you love the slate of comedic movies that have been cranking out the past several years than you'll love this movie.4.5/5",4,"I Love You, Man",1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,4614,"['Peter', 'Klaven', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'just', 'asked', 'girlfriend', 'Zooey', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'marry', 'thinking', 'who', 'going', 'ask', 'be', 'best', 'man', 'groomsmen', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'male', 'friends', 'Not', 'knowing', 'how', 'really', 'talk', 'guys', 'gay', 'brother', 'Robbie', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'Robbie', 'going', 'Man', 'several', 'Man', 'Peter', 'Sydney', 'Fife', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'open', 'house', 'running', 'sell', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'home', 'Sydney', 'someone', 'looking', 'friend', 'friends', 'get', 'married', 'immersed', 'work', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'friend', 'Peter', 'world', 'mandom', 'bond', 'Rush.Since', 'summer', '2005', 'rated', 'R', 'comedy', 'had', 'major', 'resurgence', 'then', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Wedding', 'Crashers', '40', 'Year', 'Old', 'Virgin', 'Knocked', 'Up', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'Step', 'Brothers', 'Zack', 'Miri', 'Make', 'Porno', 'Role', 'Models', 'then', 'year', 'Hangover', 'course', 'resurgence', 'was', 'led', 'uber-Producer', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'made', 'movies', 'have', 'proved', 'Apatow', ""n't"", 'only', 'filmmaker', 'hand', 'type', 'comedy', 'including', 'David', 'Wain', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Todd', 'Philips', 'Now', 'John', 'Hamburg', 'who', 'worked', 'Apatow', 'TV', 'show', 'Undeclared', 'first', 'feature', 'film', '2004', 'Along', 'Came', 'Polly', 'join', 'ranks', 'join', 'R-rated', 'revolution.Let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'Love', 'Man', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'No', 'not', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'follow', 'tropes', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'movie', 'great', 'affect', 'course', 'jokes', 'are', 'played', 'gay', 'jokes', 'one', 'great', 'things', ""'ve"", 'done', 'though', 'give', 'movie', 'great', 'gay', 'characters', 'avoid', 'being', 'considered', 'homophobic', 'particular', 'Robbie', 'one', 'most', 'unstereotypically', 'gay', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'what', 'film', 'great', 'characterization', 'characters', 'act', 'feel', 'real', ""'re"", 'truly', 'empathetic', 'characters', 'when', 'comedy', 'laugh', 'genuine', 'even', 'lot', 'borne', 'Peter', 'awkwardness', 'when', 'comedy', 'come', 'hard', 'feels', 'fresh.Typically', 'lot', 'comedies', 'especially', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'not', 'really', 'fair', 'talk', 'acting', 'movie', 'follow', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'guidelines', 'not', 'typically', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'who', 'who', 'list', 'comedic', 'royalty', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'have', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'who', 'was', 'better', 'known', 'dramatic', 'work', 'Anchorman', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'writer', 'star', 'Forgetting', 'Sarah', 'Marshall', 'as', 'well', 'Marshall', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'also', 'have', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'SNL', 'Cloudy', 'chance', 'Meatballs', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'Cop', 'Out', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Swingers', 'as', 'well', 'director', 'Elf', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'Name', 'Earl', 'Not', 'Teen', 'Movie', 'Joe', 'Lo', 'Truglio', 'Reno', '911', 'Role', 'Models', 'Thomas', 'Lennon', 'Reno', '911', 'State', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'SNL', 'Alumni', '3rd', 'Rock', 'Sun', 'JK', 'Simmons', 'Thank', 'Smoking', 'Juno', 'movie', 'truly', 'would', 'work', 'were', ""n't"", 'Rudd', 'Segel', 'have', 'perfect', 'chemistry', 'bromance', 'had', 'fault', 'movie', 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'plotline', 'generic', 'Love', 'Man', ""n't"", 'really', 'deviate', 'general', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'outline', 'also', 'believe', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'purpose', ""n't"", 'really', 'been', 'true', 'bromance', 'movie', 'just', 'movies', 'allude', 'bromances', 'recently', 'been', 'lot', 'talk', 'bromance', 'movie', 'chose', 'exploit', 'great', 'job', 'think', 'order', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'straight', 'guys', 'hooking', 'up', 'had', 'follow', 'outline', 'main', 'problem', 'break', 'up', 'point', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'here', 'little', 'forced', 'Yeah', 'got', 'great', 'comedy', 'surrounding', 'moment', 'billboards', 'are', 'genius', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'seemed', 'too', 'little', 'really', 'set', 'off', 'break', 'up', 'should', 'have', 'resulted', 'somewhat', 'quicker', 'make', 'up', 'make', 'up', 'also', 'genius', 'just', 'small', 'hiccupin', 'otherwise', 'great', 'movie.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'opinion', 'rewatching', 'few', 'comedies', '2009', 'favorite', 'even', 'moreso', 'Hangover', 'would', 'fall', 'top', '5', 'favorite', 'movies', 'year', 'Trust', 'love', 'slate', 'comedic', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'cranking', 'past', 'several', 'years', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie.4.5/5']",N/A

Oddly enough, I Love You, Man is funnier than Apatow's most recent outing and is one of the funniest movies I've seen this year. However, it's not timeless and it's not perfect either.Paul Rudd is Peter Klaven, newly engaged to Zooey (Rashida Jones). Peter is loved by women but has never really had any male friends. This is brought to his attention when the question of who will be his best man at his wedding arises. Peter unsuccessfully searches for a male friend when, one day, he meets Sydney Fife (Jason Segel), who is exactly what Peter is looking for.The movie also stars J.K. Simmons (hilarious as Peter's dad), Jon Favreau, and Jaime Pressly. There's come cameos too, by Lou Ferrigno (actually more of a character than a cameo) and the Canadian rock band Rush. Fans of the band will be amused by the fanboy raving of the two main characters.Much like Apatow movies, the supporting cast is key to the film's success but Rudd and Segel are perfect in their roles, Rudd playing awkward and Segel playing arrogant. The movie captures that angle of male friendships very well when it could've moved straight for cliched buddy-movie territory. There were, however, scenes of Peter acting more awkward than the average awkward male that made me question why Sydney would actually be friends with him.But, beyond trivial complaints, this movie is an entertaining, very funny comedy. The humor isn't totally unique, but works and if a joke falls flat there's always another trailing behind it.GRADE: B",4,Very Funny!,1252800000,"09 13, 2009",2009,1615,"['many', 'have', 'mentioned', 'already', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'influence', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'Love', 'Man', 'funnier', 'Apatow', 'most', 'recent', 'outing', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'However', 'not', 'timeless', 'not', 'perfect', 'either.Paul', 'Rudd', 'Peter', 'Klaven', 'newly', 'engaged', 'Zooey', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'Peter', 'loved', 'women', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'male', 'friends', 'brought', 'attention', 'when', 'question', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'man', 'wedding', 'arises', 'Peter', 'unsuccessfully', 'male', 'friend', 'when', 'one', 'day', 'Sydney', 'Fife', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'who', 'exactly', 'what', 'Peter', 'looking', 'for.The', 'movie', 'also', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'hilarious', 'Peter', 'dad', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'come', 'cameos', 'too', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'actually', 'more', 'character', 'cameo', 'Canadian', 'rock', 'band', 'Rush', 'Fans', 'band', 'will', 'be', 'amused', 'fanboy', 'raving', 'two', 'main', 'characters.Much', 'Apatow', 'movies', 'supporting', 'cast', 'key', 'film', 'success', 'Rudd', 'Segel', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'Rudd', 'playing', 'awkward', 'Segel', 'playing', 'arrogant', 'movie', 'angle', 'male', 'friendships', 'very', 'well', 'when', 'could', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'straight', 'cliched', 'buddy-movie', 'territory', 'were', 'however', 'scenes', 'Peter', 'acting', 'more', 'awkward', 'average', 'awkward', 'male', 'made', 'question', 'why', 'Sydney', 'would', 'actually', 'be', 'friends', 'him.But', 'trivial', 'complaints', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'very', 'funny', 'comedy', 'humor', ""n't"", 'totally', 'unique', 'works', 'joke', 'flat', 'always', 'trailing', 'it.GRADE', 'B']",N/A

So I can't quite agree with those who give it five stars and rave about it like they've discovered the new Caddyshack or Animal House.... but I also don't agree with those who give the movie one or two stars and call it horrible. It is certainly not horrible. It's funny actually. Laugh out loud funny in many scenes - and this is coming from someone who is fairly jaded about comedy and doesn't laugh out loud easily.The plot is predictable for the most part, and the characters are fairly shallowly drawn... but that is okay, because it's a comedy film. The comedic chemistry between Paul Rudd and Jason Segel works well, and make the film very easy to enjoy. There is a minimum of (but not an absence of) gross sophomoric humor for it's own sake, which is usually what I can't stand about most modern comedies.The ""twist"" in this film is that the main characters both discover that they are fans of the rock band Rush, and this bond becomes a thread throughout the movie. If you are a Rush fan (and I am) this makes the film much more fun to follow, and you'll get some of the little inside jokes that others might miss.

1229406,A136MAOWGCU2C2,B001PR0Y6W,K.T. May,"[2, 2]","""I Love You, Man"" was released on DVD this week and it would not be a waste of your time to check this out.Paul Rudd stars as Peter Klaven, a role that fits him like a glove.  Peter is a real estate agent and a ""really, nice guy"" who has never found the right man, to be his best friend, that is.  Peter is a lovable character, despite being king of the ""saying stupid things while trying to sound cool"" personality trait.Peter is about to marry his girlfriend, Zooey, (Rashida Jones).  But he is soon reminded that he does not have a best friend to be his best man.  Of course, he could go with the easy choice of his brother, Robbie, played by Andy Samberg, but then, there would be no movie.Peter attempts to try his hand at a friendship with Zooey's girlfriend's, (Jaime Pressley) husband, Barry, (Jon Favreau), but doesn't fit into the niche of frat-boy-like behavior that Barry enjoys.  Plus, Barry hates him.  So from there, he tries to be friends with various men, which results in a hysterical mis-understanding when one of the men Peter is paired up with wants a lot more from him than just to be his best man.Enter Sidney, (Jason Segal of ""How I Met Your Mother"" fame), whom Peter meets at an open house he has arranged to try to sell Lou Ferrigno's, (a.k.a. ""The Hulk""), estate.  Sidney's not there to buy the house, though.  He's there to check out the divorcees and free food, which gives the audiencea great insight into Sidney's character.Sidney is the typical ""stop worrying so much and enjoy life"" character.  He encourages Peter to talk to him about his masturbatory habits and even lets his dog crap on the boardwalk without caring enough to pick it up.  Plus, he and Peter have something strong in common--their adoration for the band Rush.  This leads to a hilarious montage of them playing around like they're in the band.  Later in the film, they finally get to go to a Rush concert, which ends up annoying Zooey, since not only was this her and Peter's ""HBO Night"", but now Peter has dragged her along for the concert, where he is paying little to no attention to her and is instead jamming out with Sidney.Sidney tries to appease Peter by getting more involved in his and Zooey's activities, but when he starts getting in the way of their relationship, he decides to back out of his friendship with Peter.  Peter is best man-less again and, worst of all, he has lost the friendship of the only best guy friend he ever had.  Can they mend fences before Peter's marriage?Not always laugh out loud funny, (although you will be quoting ""slappa da BASS"" for months after seeing this), it is a cute film and a great date movie.  Guys will enjoy some of the crude humor that inevitably exists in a ""guy film"" and girls will get a kick out of some of the humor as well as the sentimentality.  You should definitely check this film out, even if it's for a one-time watch.",3,"I love you, I Love You, Man!",1250035200,"08 12, 2009",2009,2888,"['Love', 'Man', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'week', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'check', 'out.Paul', 'Rudd', 'Peter', 'Klaven', 'role', 'glove', 'Peter', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'found', 'right', 'man', 'be', 'best', 'friend', 'Peter', 'lovable', 'character', 'being', 'king', 'saying', 'stupid', 'things', 'trying', 'sound', 'cool', 'personality', 'trait.Peter', 'marry', 'girlfriend', 'Zooey', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'soon', 'reminded', 'not', 'have', 'best', 'friend', 'be', 'best', 'man', 'course', 'could', 'go', 'easy', 'choice', 'brother', 'Robbie', 'played', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'movie.Peter', 'try', 'hand', 'friendship', 'Zooey', 'girlfriend', 'Jaime', 'Pressley', 'husband', 'Barry', 'Jon', 'Favreau', ""n't"", 'fit', 'niche', 'frat-boy-like', 'behavior', 'Barry', 'Barry', 'So', 'there', 'be', 'friends', 'various', 'men', 'results', 'hysterical', 'mis-understanding', 'when', 'one', 'men', 'Peter', 'paired', 'up', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'be', 'best', 'man.Enter', 'Sidney', 'Jason', 'Segal', 'How', 'Met', 'Mother', 'fame', 'whom', 'Peter', 'meets', 'open', 'house', 'arranged', 'try', 'sell', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'a.k.a', 'Hulk', 'estate', 'Sidney', 'not', 'there', 'buy', 'house', 'though', 'there', 'check', 'out', 'divorcees', 'free', 'food', 'audiencea', 'great', 'insight', 'Sidney', 'character.Sidney', 'typical', 'stop', 'worrying', 'so', 'much', 'enjoy', 'life', 'character', 'Peter', 'talk', 'masturbatory', 'habits', 'even', 'dog', 'crap', 'boardwalk', 'caring', 'enough', 'pick', 'up', 'Peter', 'have', 'something', 'strong', 'common', 'adoration', 'band', 'Rush', 'hilarious', 'montage', 'playing', ""'re"", 'band', 'Later', 'film', 'finally', 'get', 'go', 'Rush', 'concert', 'up', 'annoying', 'Zooey', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'Peter', 'HBO', 'Night', 'now', 'Peter', 'dragged', 'along', 'concert', 'where', 'paying', 'little', 'attention', 'instead', 'jamming', 'out', 'Sidney.Sidney', 'tries', 'appease', 'Peter', 'getting', 'more', 'involved', 'Zooey', 'activities', 'when', 'getting', 'way', 'relationship', 'back', 'friendship', 'Peter', 'Peter', 'best', 'man-less', 'again', 'worst', 'lost', 'friendship', 'only', 'best', 'guy', 'friend', 'ever', 'had', 'Can', 'mend', 'fences', 'Peter', 'marriage', 'Not', 'always', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'will', 'be', 'quoting', 'slappa', 'da', 'BASS', 'months', 'seeing', 'cute', 'film', 'great', 'date', 'movie', 'Guys', 'will', 'enjoy', 'crude', 'humor', 'inevitably', 'guy', 'film', 'girls', 'will', 'get', 'kick', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'sentimentality', 'should', 'definitely', 'check', 'film', 'even', 'one-time', 'watch']",N/A

They say that is important to a relationship because when he is out with the guys Zooey can do girl things.

Eventually, Peter seems to give up on the idea until he meets Sydney while holding an open house to sell Lou Ferrigno's house.  Sydney is one of the most interesting guys that Peter has ever met and it is both Sydney's offbeat personality and his interest in Rush music that intrigues Peter.Peter's relationship with Zooey had seemed perfect before he met Sydney but now it becomes complicated.  Zooey seems to be jealous of the bonding that Peter has will Sydney.  Their engagement will face challenges as well as Peter's friendship with Sydney.The movie works because of the chemistry of the three actors.  The supporting cast also lends the comic relief from the obnoxious John Favreau as Zooey's best friend's husband, Andy Sandler as Peter's brother and J.K. Simmons as Peter's father.

1229420,AOLHE547CHOTX,B001PR0Y6W,Michael Profit,"[2, 2]","Though not officially a romantic comedy, ""I Love You, Man"" explores the complexities of a relationship between two people with different ideologies. Rather than the male-female storyline that makes up most movies of this genre, however, this movie focuses on the lesser advertised but still relevant male-male ""buddy"" relationship that has become more popular over the past few years.Starring Paul Rudd and Jason Segel, ""I Love You, Man"" follows Peter (Rudd), a recently-engaged real estate agent living in Los Angeles. Though Peter and his fianc&eacute;e Zooey (""Parks and Recreation's"" Rashida Jones) have a strong relationship, Peter struggles to form friendships with guys, often finding it difficult to relate to masculine hobbies like poker and fantasy sports. After overhearing some of Zooey's friends express their concern over his lack of male friends and its potential impact on their relationship, Peter decides to seek out a guy to be best man at his wedding.Following a series of hilariously disastrous ""man dates,"" Peter meets Sydney (Segel), a free-spirited investor whom Peter immediately takes an obvious liking to despite their many varied differences and contrasting personalities. While Peter is comically awkward as he prepares to call Sydney for the first time, Sydney is cool and laid back as he reveals his true intentions for attending Peter's open house. Both characters function very differently, and in many ways seem like the most unlikely pairing, yet their friendship develops as a result of these differences (along with a mutual admiration of the band Rush).The strength of ""I Love You, Man"" is in the relationship between the two main characters and the actors that play them. Peter is an honest, humble everyday man with the best of intentions in mind, and while a character like Sydney could oftentimes come across as unlikeable and unsympathetic, he instead is a genuinely nice (if at times strange) guy looking for a close friend worthy of his time. Both Rudd and Segel bring these qualities to characters it seems were written with them in mind, and the two have a great on-screen chemistry that allows the movie to function so well.With a different take on the typical romantic comedy plot, great and relatable characters, and consistently funny jokes throughout, ""I Love You, Man"" is a top-notch comedy that is sure to entertain. This movie is highly recommended for those who love light-hearted comedies and movies that focus heavily on male-male relationships.",4,"I Love You, Man: An Hysterical, Atypical Rom-Com",1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,2503,"['not', 'officially', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Love', 'complexities', 'relationship', 'two', 'people', 'different', 'ideologies', 'Rather', 'male-female', 'storyline', 'up', 'most', 'movies', 'genre', 'however', 'movie', 'lesser', 'advertised', 'still', 'relevant', 'male-male', 'buddy', 'relationship', 'become', 'more', 'popular', 'past', 'few', 'years.Starring', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'Love', 'Man', 'Peter', 'Rudd', 'recently-engaged', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'living', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Though', 'Peter', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Zooey', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'have', 'strong', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'form', 'friendships', 'guys', 'often', 'finding', 'difficult', 'relate', 'masculine', 'hobbies', 'poker', 'fantasy', 'sports', 'overhearing', 'Zooey', 'friends', 'express', 'concern', 'lack', 'male', 'friends', 'potential', 'impact', 'relationship', 'Peter', 'seek', 'out', 'guy', 'be', 'best', 'man', 'wedding.Following', 'series', 'hilariously', 'disastrous', 'man', 'dates', 'Peter', 'meets', 'Sydney', 'Segel', 'free-spirited', 'investor', 'whom', 'Peter', 'immediately', 'obvious', 'liking', 'many', 'varied', 'differences', 'contrasting', 'personalities', 'Peter', 'comically', 'awkward', 'call', 'Sydney', 'first', 'time', 'Sydney', 'cool', 'laid', 'back', 'true', 'intentions', 'attending', 'Peter', 'open', 'house', 'characters', 'function', 'very', 'differently', 'many', 'ways', 'seem', 'most', 'unlikely', 'pairing', 'friendship', 'result', 'differences', 'mutual', 'admiration', 'band', 'Rush', '.The', 'strength', 'Love', 'Man', 'relationship', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'actors', 'play', 'Peter', 'honest', 'humble', 'everyday', 'man', 'best', 'intentions', 'mind', 'character', 'Sydney', 'could', 'oftentimes', 'come', 'unlikeable', 'unsympathetic', 'instead', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'times', 'strange', 'guy', 'looking', 'close', 'friend', 'worthy', 'time', 'Rudd', 'Segel', 'bring', 'qualities', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'mind', 'two', 'have', 'great', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'movie', 'function', 'so', 'well.With', 'different', 'take', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'plot', 'great', 'relatable', 'characters', 'consistently', 'funny', 'jokes', 'Love', 'Man', 'top-notch', 'comedy', 'sure', 'entertain', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'love', 'light-hearted', 'comedies', 'movies', 'focus', 'heavily', 'male-male', 'relationships']",N/A

He goes on a variety of man-dates with different male friends only to be annoyed, rejected, misled, or erroneously mistaken as as gay.  Well, during an open house at Lou Ferrigno's place (who is played by himself), Peter meets Sydney Fife (Jason Segel) and the two instantly-hit it off.  Though Sydney gives Peter grief for not being more social, the two have an intense bond and begin to hang out nearly every waking moment together.  Although Zooey enjoys this at first, she starts to become concerned with the amount of time Peter begins to spend with Sydney and the effect that Sydney's wild personality has on their own relationship.  Will Peter and Sydney take their ""bromance"" to other levels or will Peter and Sydney go their separate ways now that Peter's going to take the plunge?There were many other elements in this film that you get to see in many of the other comedies that are coming out nowadays.  You've got two of the bigger-name comedy actors who are in California and trying to keep friends and romance balanced all while worshiping a classic rock band.  However, what made this film enjoyable was how well the plot moved and how everything else came together for Peter.  In the end, the movie left you with the moral that the right spouse will keep your friends in your life instead of trying to alienate you from them.I dug it and recommend it to fans of comedy.",3,Another Comedy In The Apatow Vein That's Slightly Better Than The Rest (3.5/5 Stars),1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,1641,"['Synopsis', 'Peter', 'Klaven', 'played', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'who', 'set', 'be', 'married', 'lovely', 'Zooey', 'Rice', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'when', 'attention', 'concern', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'male', 'friends', 'stand', 'up', 'Best', 'Man', 'variety', 'man-dates', 'different', 'male', 'only', 'be', 'annoyed', 'rejected', 'misled', 'erroneously', 'mistaken', 'gay', 'Well', 'open', 'house', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'place', 'who', 'played', 'Peter', 'Sydney', 'Fife', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'two', 'instantly-hit', 'off', 'Sydney', 'Peter', 'grief', 'not', 'being', 'more', 'social', 'two', 'have', 'intense', 'bond', 'begin', 'hang', 'out', 'nearly', 'waking', 'moment', 'together', 'Zooey', 'first', 'become', 'concerned', 'amount', 'time', 'Peter', 'spend', 'Sydney', 'effect', 'Sydney', 'wild', 'personality', 'own', 'relationship', 'Will', 'Peter', 'Sydney', 'take', 'bromance', 'other', 'levels', 'will', 'Peter', 'Sydney', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'now', 'Peter', 'going', 'take', 'plunge', 'were', 'many', 'other', 'elements', 'film', 'get', 'see', 'many', 'other', 'comedies', 'are', 'coming', 'out', 'nowadays', ""'ve"", 'got', 'two', 'bigger-name', 'comedy', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'California', 'trying', 'keep', 'friends', 'romance', 'balanced', 'worshiping', 'classic', 'rock', 'band', 'However', 'what', 'made', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'how', 'well', 'plot', 'moved', 'how', 'everything', 'else', 'came', 'together', 'Peter', 'end', 'movie', 'left', 'moral', 'right', 'spouse', 'will', 'keep', 'friends', 'life', 'instead', 'trying', 'alienate', 'them.I', 'dug', 'recommend', 'fans', 'comedy']",N/A

The premise could have been tricky to handle, and in lesser hands, the film could have been an amusing but forgettable diversion.  But director John Hamburg shows his skill by doing an outstanding job making everything work, turning a clever concept into a truly excellent movie.  The film is solidly cast throughout, with no weak links, and in fact, there are so many talented actors/actresses that even the minor roles are memorable and funny.  While nobody does any scene-stealing, Jon Favreau comes close, with sarcastic mutterings that almost serve like a Greek chorus of cynicism.As for the main characters, Paul Rudd finally gets a film that capitalizes on his considerable talents as a comedian and a serious actor.  The awkward Klaven-isms he delivers throughout the movie had me laughing non-stop. Jason Segel also does an amazing job, treading a fine line between an insensitive buffoon and a good-hearted, perceptive friend.  Rashida Jones is witty and believable, leaving no doubt that in spite of his various shortcomings, she loves Peter Klaven. The entire cast is more like an ensemble than a group of supporting characters, and the result is that the movie flows in a very natural way.The Blu-Ray comes with a generous set of special features, and it's there that you realize the strength of the director. There are some really funny deleted and extended scenes, and it must have been hard to edit them down, but Hamburg wisely decided to exercise great restraint in order to keep the film moving along at a brisk pace.  Far too often, comedies over-reach by letting scenes run longer than necessary.  It's totally understandable, but Hamburg made the right choice.

The solution?  Go out and make some platonic guy friends, even if it means having to rely on your mommy (Jane Curtin) and your gay younger brother (Andy Samberg) to help you do it.  Eventually, after a number of faltering attempts, Kevin alights on Sydney (Jason Segel), a mucho macho bundle of testosterone who, like a latter-day Henry Higgins to Kevin's Eliza Doolittle, instructs the awkward lad on the fine art of ""being a man.""  But as with any good teacher/pupil relationship, each side winds up learning a little something from the other before it's all over.A straight man far more comfortable in the company of women than of men, Kevin emerges as the ultimate metrosexual figure:  fastidious in demeanor, sensitive to the needs of others, and courteous to a fault (he even admits to liking ""The Devil Wears Prada"" in a moment of unguarded weakness).  He doesn't really know how to roughhouse it with the boys, and any efforts he makes in that direction inevitably lead to failure.  Until our man Sydney steps into the breach to give him a few badly needed pointers, that is.Smoothly directed by John Hamburg, ""I Love You, Man"" is a relaxed, breezy and sharply written male-bonding comedy that - miracle of miracles  - doesn't play down to its audience (it may be crude at times, but it`s rarely childish).  The Hamburg/Larry Levin screenplay does a clever job poking fun at the double entendres inherent in any modern-day bromance, though one wishes certain characters - Kevin's family members, in particular - had been allotted a little more in the way of screen time.  That being said, the performances are all first-rate, with Rudd and Segel playing to their respective strengths - Rudd's of the tongue-tied, self-effacing Mr. Nice Guy who needs lessons in ""manning up,"" and Segel's of the refreshingly blunt but socially indelicate Man/Child who clearly needs do do some growing up.There's additional excellent work from J.K. Simmons, Jamie Pressly, Sarah Burns and Rob Huebel, among others.It's also a bit of a casting coup to get both Jane Curtin from the first generation of SNL players and Andy Samberg from the current one together in the same film.

1229449,A3O8YT41TDXL0B,B001PR0Y6W,"Rudy Palma ""The Writing Fiend""","[3, 3]","Sometimes half-baked scripts happen to great ideas. Sometimes fine performances come to the rescue.Writer/director John Hamburg's ""I Love You, Man,"" the latest installment in the frat pack franchise, makes it over the threshold from washout to winner by the skin of its teeth. Co-writer Larry Levin's premise - a man is about to marry his ideal woman but must embark on a series of ""man dates"" to find friendship and a hopeful best man for the wedding - is not only overdue but lends itself to a multitude of opportunities, a veritable comedic goldmine. The script does not succeed in exploiting most of them, but stars Paul Rudd and Jason Segel have the chemistry and comedic chops to convince viewers it has.Rudd, as protagonist Peter Klaven, overcomes a great deal -a less attentive actor would trip over Peter's stilted, often unbelievable dialogue, but Rudd successfully avoids the bulk of the script's obstacles.Peter is a button-down real estate salesman set to marry Zooey, played by Rashida Jones. When he overhears a conversation among Zooey and her friends that his friendlessness could lead not only to a shortchanged wedding party but to his long term clinginess he takes a more proactive approach with his personal life for Zooey's sake as well as his own. After some hilarious setbacks brought on by his well-intentioned brother Robby, gamely played by Andy Samberg, he meets Segel's Sydney Fife and the ""bromance"" is soon under way.Rudd makes us root for Peter even though he makes a consistent fool of himself. He stumbles over frat house lingo and mannerisms in inexplicably overzealous effort to endear himself to the cool, laid back Sydney, but he has no learning curve. It brings to mind Steve Carrell in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" but here it makes Peter unbelievable and momentarily unsympathetic. Segel succeeds at portraying Sydney Fife as the ideal archetype - the impulsive, charismatic, self-effacing, fish taco-eating, Rush concert-going buddy every guy would like to have on speed dial - but this makes it difficult to stomach that he himself would have a short list of friends (one of whom is enslaved to watching ""Mr. Magorium's Magic Emporium"" every weekend with his kids) or that he would put up with some of Peter's more questionable antics.Hearty hilarity nevertheless makes up for thinness of plot. Scenes involving baffling billboard ads, eventful clothes shopping and a toast gone awry, as well as what it implies, provide some of the best moments, and Thomas Lennon is a hoot as Peter's opportunistic colleague. Lou Ferrigno is also a welcome addition in an extended cameo role as one of Peter's disgruntled clients, while Jon Favreau and Jaime Pressly are darkly funny as Zooey's friends, at each other's throats by day and at it like bunnies by night. J.K. Simmons and Jane Curtin round out the cast as Peter's eccentric parents.Importantly, the movie manages to be sincere, even touching, in the way it portrays the re-christened nature of male friendships circa 2009. The humor associated with this exploration, hinging though it does on an uneven script, comes off endearingly. Comedy after all is less dependent on characterization than delivery - ""I Love You, Man"" aims to please on many angles and succeeds where it counts for a carefree night at the movies.- March 2009",4,Just Good Friends?,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,3317,"['Sometimes', 'half-baked', 'scripts', 'happen', 'great', 'ideas', 'Sometimes', 'fine', 'performances', 'come', 'rescue.Writer/director', 'John', 'Hamburg', 'Love', 'Man', 'latest', 'installment', 'frat', 'pack', 'franchise', 'threshold', 'washout', 'winner', 'skin', 'teeth', 'Co-writer', 'Larry', 'Levin', 'premise', 'man', 'marry', 'ideal', 'woman', 'must', 'embark', 'series', 'man', 'dates', 'find', 'friendship', 'hopeful', 'best', 'man', 'wedding', 'not', 'only', 'overdue', 'multitude', 'opportunities', 'veritable', 'comedic', 'goldmine', 'script', 'not', 'succeed', 'exploiting', 'most', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'have', 'chemistry', 'comedic', 'chops', 'convince', 'viewers', 'has.Rudd', 'protagonist', 'Peter', 'Klaven', 'great', 'deal', '-a', 'less', 'attentive', 'actor', 'would', 'trip', 'Peter', 'stilted', 'often', 'unbelievable', 'dialogue', 'Rudd', 'successfully', 'bulk', 'script', 'obstacles.Peter', 'button-down', 'real', 'estate', 'salesman', 'set', 'marry', 'Zooey', 'played', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'When', 'conversation', 'Zooey', 'friends', 'friendlessness', 'could', 'lead', 'not', 'only', 'shortchanged', 'wedding', 'party', 'long', 'term', 'clinginess', 'more', 'proactive', 'approach', 'personal', 'life', 'Zooey', 'sake', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'hilarious', 'setbacks', 'brought', 'well-intentioned', 'brother', 'Robby', 'gamely', 'played', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'Segel', 'Sydney', 'Fife', 'bromance', 'soon', 'way.Rudd', 'root', 'Peter', 'even', 'consistent', 'fool', 'frat', 'house', 'lingo', 'mannerisms', 'inexplicably', 'overzealous', 'effort', 'endear', 'cool', 'laid', 'back', 'Sydney', 'learning', 'curve', 'mind', 'Steve', 'Carrell', '40-Year-Old', 'Virgin', 'here', 'Peter', 'unbelievable', 'momentarily', 'unsympathetic', 'Segel', 'portraying', 'Sydney', 'Fife', 'ideal', 'archetype', 'impulsive', 'charismatic', 'self-effacing', 'fish', 'taco-eating', 'Rush', 'concert-going', 'buddy', 'guy', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'speed', 'dial', 'difficult', 'stomach', 'would', 'have', 'short', 'list', 'friends', 'one', 'whom', 'enslaved', 'watching', 'Mr.', 'Magorium', 'Magic', 'Emporium', 'weekend', 'kids', 'would', 'put', 'up', 'Peter', 'more', 'questionable', 'antics.Hearty', 'hilarity', 'nevertheless', 'up', 'thinness', 'plot', 'Scenes', 'involving', 'baffling', 'billboard', 'ads', 'eventful', 'clothes', 'shopping', 'toast', 'gone', 'awry', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'provide', 'best', 'moments', 'Thomas', 'Lennon', 'hoot', 'Peter', 'opportunistic', 'colleague', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'also', 'welcome', 'addition', 'extended', 'cameo', 'role', 'one', 'Peter', 'disgruntled', 'clients', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Jaime', 'Pressly', 'are', 'darkly', 'funny', 'Zooey', 'friends', 'other', 'throats', 'day', 'bunnies', 'night', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'round', 'out', 'cast', 'Peter', 'eccentric', 'parents.Importantly', 'movie', 'be', 'sincere', 'even', 'touching', 'way', 're-christened', 'nature', 'male', 'friendships', 'circa', '2009', 'humor', 'associated', 'exploration', 'hinging', 'uneven', 'script', 'off', 'endearingly', 'Comedy', 'less', 'dependent', 'characterization', 'delivery', 'Love', 'Man', 'please', 'many', 'angles', 'where', 'carefree', 'night', 'movies.-', 'March', '2009']",N/A

Mr. Rudd and Mr. Segel are genuinely likeable and clearly have talent to burn.  They do their best to prop up the lackluster script, but ultimately get swamped by the long stretches of unfunny.  The pacing of the movie is completely off, it is too long, and the point of each scene is beaten to death.One of the worst things about the humor in this movie is how crude it is.  To pull off good, crude humor (see Superbad), the script has to be really clever, and the direction has to be spot-on.  Otherwise it just comes off as simply gross and uncomfortable, as for example, I Love You's scene that goes into sickening detail regarding the Segel character's masturbation habits.The other failure of the movie is the fault of the director.  Many scenes which should have been cut down, instead stretch on for an eternity, like bad Saturday Night Live skits that would have been funny if they were half as long.  The finale at the wedding is a prime example--an agonizingly long scene in which the point was made in 5 minutes, drags for about 5 extra unfunny ones in which the point is beaten to death and the only laughs to be had are ones of discomfort.  Another example is the scene at the Rush concert.  The joke, and the point, was made in a couple minutes...but the scene just keeps going and going...The movie has its amusing moments, and again, the performances by Rudd and Segel save this from being a complete waste.

The plot offers virtually no surprises, and its formulaic approach to a fairly unique perspective on the awkward humor of male bonding doesn't help the film's impact, but fortunately the two leads' enthusiastic energy (and willingness to do anything for a laugh) keeps the proceedings lively, raunchy and often surprisingly entertaining.After Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) proposes to his girlfriend Zoe (Rashida Jones) and begins preparing for their big day, he realizes he's never really had a close enough friend to be best man at his wedding.  Taking the advice from his family, and a little tutoring from his gay brother Robbie (Andy Samberg in a hilarious supporting role), Peter initiates several awkward and highly unsuccessful ""man dates"" in an attempt to find a worthy friend.  On the verge of giving up, Klaven randomly meets Sydney Fife (Jason Segel), a brazenly straight-forward, recklessly carefree troublemaker who oddly has quite a bit in common with Peter.  As the two quickly bond, Peter's relationship with Zoe becomes strained and he must determine if his newfound friend's audacious attitude is actually ruining his chance at finding true happiness.An initial influx of crude sexual jokes gets things started in the routine humor of ""I Love You, Man."" Parents openly talking dirty, spontaneous vomiting in the faces of others, fart analysis and a dog relieving itself follow up for more laughs and sadly, but understandably, receives them. The foul-mouthed, unrefined vulgarity is constant and expected and seems to always get a rise from the audience. Since it never goes beyond that, those looking for remnants of intelligent humor or hilarious setups will be left disappointed. It's a raunchy comedy seeking out the easy laughs based on increasing levels of obnoxiousness and doesn't pretend to be anything else.At least the premise is refreshing, twisting around the idea of a man in search of a significant other. Peter isn't trying to get laid, hook up with the hot chick, lose his virginity, or exploit any of the other numerous clich&eacute; plots in comparable adult comedies. It's most amusing to see that acquiring a male platonic friend is the more formidable game. In his quest, many running jokes are reused to the point of detestable - it's a run-of-the-mill approach to what started as an original angle; the follow-through leaves much to be desired as the male bonding becomes overpowering, the dialogue is a bit too silly (""frosty-haired chode""), key points parallel the weepiest chick flicks, and the plot progression never ventures far from completely predictable.- The Massie Twins",3,"I Love You, Man Movie Review from The Massie Twins",1237507200,"03 20, 2009",2009,2824,"['Love', 'Man', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'nearly', 'impeccable', 'comic', 'timing', 'admirably', 'maximum', 'number', 'laughs', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'keep', 'up', 'momentum', 'plot', 'virtually', 'surprises', 'formulaic', 'approach', 'fairly', 'unique', 'perspective', 'awkward', 'humor', 'male', 'bonding', ""n't"", 'help', 'film', 'impact', 'fortunately', 'two', 'leads', 'enthusiastic', 'energy', 'willingness', 'do', 'anything', 'laugh', 'proceedings', 'lively', 'raunchy', 'often', 'surprisingly', 'entertaining.After', 'Peter', 'Klaven', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'girlfriend', 'Zoe', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'preparing', 'big', 'day', 'never', 'really', 'had', 'close', 'enough', 'friend', 'be', 'best', 'man', 'wedding', 'Taking', 'advice', 'family', 'little', 'tutoring', 'gay', 'brother', 'Robbie', 'Andy', 'Samberg', 'hilarious', 'supporting', 'role', 'Peter', 'several', 'awkward', 'highly', 'unsuccessful', 'man', 'dates', 'attempt', 'find', 'worthy', 'friend', 'verge', 'giving', 'up', 'Klaven', 'meets', 'Sydney', 'Fife', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'brazenly', 'straight-forward', 'recklessly', 'carefree', 'troublemaker', 'who', 'oddly', 'quite', 'bit', 'common', 'Peter', 'two', 'quickly', 'bond', 'Peter', 'relationship', 'Zoe', 'becomes', 'strained', 'must', 'determine', 'newfound', 'friend', 'audacious', 'attitude', 'actually', 'ruining', 'chance', 'finding', 'true', 'happiness.An', 'initial', 'influx', 'crude', 'sexual', 'jokes', 'things', 'started', 'routine', 'humor', 'Love', 'Man', 'openly', 'talking', 'dirty', 'spontaneous', 'vomiting', 'others', 'fart', 'analysis', 'dog', 'relieving', 'follow', 'up', 'more', 'laughs', 'sadly', 'understandably', 'foul-mouthed', 'unrefined', 'vulgarity', 'constant', 'expected', 'always', 'get', 'rise', 'audience', 'never', 'looking', 'remnants', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'hilarious', 'setups', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'disappointed', 'raunchy', 'comedy', 'seeking', 'out', 'easy', 'laughs', 'based', 'increasing', 'levels', 'obnoxiousness', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'anything', 'else.At', 'least', 'premise', 'refreshing', 'twisting', 'idea', 'man', 'search', 'significant', 'other', 'Peter', ""n't"", 'trying', 'get', 'laid', 'hook', 'up', 'hot', 'chick', 'lose', 'virginity', 'other', 'numerous', 'clich', 'eacute', 'plots', 'comparable', 'adult', 'comedies', 'most', 'amusing', 'see', 'acquiring', 'male', 'platonic', 'friend', 'more', 'formidable', 'game', 'quest', 'many', 'running', 'jokes', 'are', 'reused', 'point', 'detestable', 'run-of-the-mill', 'approach', 'what', 'started', 'original', 'angle', 'follow-through', 'leaves', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'male', 'bonding', 'becomes', 'overpowering', 'dialogue', 'bit', 'too', 'silly', 'frosty-haired', 'chode', 'key', 'points', 'weepiest', 'chick', 'flicks', 'plot', 'progression', 'never', 'ventures', 'far', 'completely', 'predictable.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A

As Zooey tells all of her friends and family, she asks Peter if he wants to use the phone to tell his friends. But he doesn't really have a lot of friends, as his dad (JK Simmons) reveals one night at dinner with the family. Yes, Peter always had more female friends, chimes in his mom (Jane Curtin). Peter suddenly realizes he will have trouble finding a Best Man for the wedding. Zooey encourages him to try to find some friends, but she isn't concerned about the wedding party being unbalanced, even after her BFF Denise (Jaime Pressly, TV's ""My Name is Earl"") brings the subject up. But Peter decides he needs to find some friends and meets a bunch of possibilities, including a strange guy his gay brother (Andy Samberg, ""Saturday Night Live"") sets him up with. Then, he meets Sydney Fife (Jason Segal, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") who has crashed an open house Peter is hosting at Lou Ferrigno's home. Peter is a real estate agent and is trying to sell the home to make a huge commission and develop a real estate plan of his own. They go out a few times and Peter decides to introduce him to Zooey. But both Zooey and Peter talk to their friends a lot, and share very personal things, which comes back to haunt both of them.""I Love You, Man,"" co-written by John Hamburg (writer of ""Meet the Parents"" and writer/director of ""Along Came Polly"") and Larry Levine (""Dr. Doolittle"") and directed by Hamburg, is a very funny movie.Very much like a Judd Apatow film, Hamburg and Levine have created a natural universe for their characters to romp through. Perhaps the best thing about this film is that almost every lead character has a real basis in the real world. They get involved in strange and wacky situations, but because we believe they could exist, these situations are funnier and more interesting. Every film is better when there is at least a small part of it based in reality. If these characters exist in a real world, what happens to them, what they do, how they react, everything is funnier because we feel it could happen.Paul Rudd has become so great at playing the Confused, Awkward Caucasian it is almost becoming his stock character. In ""Man"", he uses all of his trademarks (awkward statements, attempts to fit in with the rest, nervousness) to make Peter a very funny guy. A lot of the humor from this character, and most Rudd plays, are that they all initially seem so normal. Peter is a Real Estate Agent with dreams to develop his own property. He is in love with his girlfriend. Everything is good in his life. Everything is normal. But then he begins to listen to Zooey's friends gossip about his lack of male friends and begins to wonder if he should have a few of these guys to call his own. He begins to worry that his lack of friends may have some affect on the wedding and begins to become frantic with worry and indecision. The word gets out, he tries to capitalize on some relationships with casual acquaintances and he begins to meet other guys, testing the waters to see if he has any potential BFFs out there.In most comedies, this would be the moment for the laughs to flow. Each of the guys would provide a brief, funny moment because they are simply so out of left field you can't help but laugh at their quirky behavior. And this is the case in ""I Love You, Man"". One of the potential friends is a guy whose voice seems to be changing, even though he is in his mid thirties. Seemingly oblivious to this fact, he begins to call out chants at an LA Galaxy soccer game, coming close to starting a riot because everyone simply wants him to shut up. Zooey's best friend, Denise (Pressly), pushes her husband to include Peter (Jon Favreau) in his next guy's night out. Peter is all for it, but can't handle the excitement too well, providing the film's required Gross Out laugh.But what sets ""I Love You, Man"" apart from the rest is Rudd's portrayal of Peter. Peter isn't just an average straight guy, designed to allow all of the other funny people to do their shtick. Peter is normal, but he also has a sense of humor and can laugh at himself. Because he has never had many male friends, when he tries to set up get-togethers with some of these potential friends, his phone calls are awkward to the point of embarrassing and he comes across as a teenager calling a girl for their first date. These moments are what help make this film stand out.Jason Segel, who was so memorable in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall, plays Sydney, a man who crashes an open house hosted by Peter. They strike up a conversation and Sydney provides keen insight to the realtor. ""That guy needs to fart. Look at the way his cheeks are clenched"", he says while pointing at a guy across the room, a guy who is using the open house to try to impress a good looking lady he is trying to date. Sure enough, he appears to be right as the guy in question does exactly what Sydney says he will. Peter is intrigued and decides to give him a try and they begin to spend time together. Peter seems to be attracted to Sydney because he is a much more unconventional guy. He spends a lot of time at home, working only when absolutely necessary. He seems to have a lot of quirks and may even be a little crazy. All traits that Peter doesn't have.A side note: As Peter tries to appear Sydney's equal; his attempts to seem 'cool' are hilariously awkward.Segel is funny as Sydney, but less original in the role. We get it, he's a slacker. He plays with his band equipment during the day, he has strange personal habits, and he likes to lay around his house when he should be working. And a lot of what he does is funny. But because he is a slacker, we sort of expect him to act like he does and it just seems less interesting and original. At one point, he asks Peter to give him some money for an investment, that's what Sydney does, invest, but Peter still becomes suspicious.The more time these two spend together, the more uninhibited Peter feels in his presence. They begin to share a lot of personal information and Peter starts to spend more time with him than with Zooey. Unfortunately, both of these points shoot the story into a pretty familiar place and because it still manages to make us laugh we continue to go along for the ride.The supporting cast is universally good. Jane Curtain has a few nice moments as Peter's mom and JK Simmons is remarkably fresh as his dad. Andy Samberg plays his gay brother, a nice supporting role with some funny moments. This is a smart move for Samberg. His first starring role in ""Hot Rod"" was a resounding dud, so he appears to be building his career back by taking smaller, more memorable roles in better films. And he continues to provide a lot of laughs on ""Saturday Night Live"". Jaime Pressly and Jon Favreau are hilarious as Zooey's best friend and her husband. And the rest of the guys who play Peter's potential BFFs are all funny for their moment in the sun.""I Love You, Man"" is a very funny film even with the few wrong steps it takes.

1229460,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B001PR0Y6W,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[4, 5]","I Love You Man covers an interesting territory: men-men friendship. Sure there are a few movies that have done this before this one but I don't think they do it quite as well as ILYM does. The movie is a little formulaic but the two main actors, Paul Rudd and Jason Segel's performances make the movie what it is, an entertaining movie on what could be called ""bromance"". The movie did fairly well at the box office when it was released in 2009, but I don't think it gets the acclaim it deserves.Peter Klaven is a real estate agent who just proposed to his wife Zoey. Peter is charming and the couple loves each other but the problem is Peter never had much male friends and can't seem to find a best man for his upcoming wedding. Peter's brother and mother try to find him a guy friend with no success. Klaven eventually meets Sidney Fife, an investor, at one of his open houses and the two quickly become very good friends. Zoey is not too thrilled with Sydney and Peter decides that maybe his relationship with Sydney should be put on hold for a while. It' not a complicated movie and towards the end it gets a little predictable but I Love You Man is a highly enjoyable movie that just about everyone can enjoy. It paints a good portrait of the relationship between men in general, I must say.This is Paul Rudd at his acting best and most honest; I can't really see anyone but Rudd playing the charming Peter Klaven. Jason Segel for his part delivers a great performance as Sidney Fife a well intentioned and free spirited friend of Peter's. What's great is that they're so different from one another; Peter is a more sensitive guy while Sydney is more of a guy's guy. Rashida Jones was great as Zoey, Peter's wife and the chemistry between the two worked well to a certain degree. The supporting cast only adds more to the movie, the actors were very good. I only have good things to say about I Love You Man, its great comedy that is well worth watching. To me this was one of the highlights of 2009 in terms of movies, an excellent comedy that's funny, touching and filled with emotional appeal that I still enjoy and watch every now and then. 5 stars for this one!",5,Where is the love between men?,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,2172,"['Love', 'Man', 'interesting', 'territory', 'men-men', 'friendship', 'Sure', 'are', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'done', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'do', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'ILYM', 'movie', 'little', 'formulaic', 'two', 'main', 'actors', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'performances', 'make', 'movie', 'what', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'bromance', 'movie', 'did', 'fairly', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'when', 'was', 'released', '2009', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'acclaim', 'deserves.Peter', 'Klaven', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'who', 'just', 'proposed', 'wife', 'Zoey', 'Peter', 'charming', 'couple', 'other', 'problem', 'Peter', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'male', 'friends', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'best', 'man', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'Peter', 'brother', 'mother', 'try', 'find', 'guy', 'friend', 'success', 'Klaven', 'eventually', 'Sidney', 'Fife', 'investor', 'one', 'open', 'houses', 'two', 'quickly', 'become', 'very', 'good', 'friends', 'Zoey', 'not', 'too', 'thrilled', 'Sydney', 'Peter', 'maybe', 'relationship', 'Sydney', 'should', 'be', 'put', 'hold', 'while', 'not', 'complicated', 'movie', 'towards', 'end', 'little', 'predictable', 'Love', 'Man', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'just', 'everyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'good', 'portrait', 'relationship', 'men', 'general', 'must', 'say.This', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'acting', 'best', 'most', 'honest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'anyone', 'Rudd', 'playing', 'charming', 'Peter', 'Klaven', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'part', 'great', 'performance', 'Sidney', 'Fife', 'well', 'intentioned', 'free', 'spirited', 'friend', 'Peter', 'What', 'great', ""'re"", 'so', 'different', 'one', 'Peter', 'more', 'sensitive', 'guy', 'Sydney', 'more', 'guy', 'guy', 'Rashida', 'Jones', 'was', 'great', 'Zoey', 'Peter', 'wife', 'chemistry', 'two', 'worked', 'well', 'certain', 'degree', 'supporting', 'cast', 'only', 'more', 'movie', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'only', 'have', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'Love', 'Man', 'great', 'comedy', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', '2009', 'terms', 'movies', 'excellent', 'comedy', 'funny', 'touching', 'filled', 'emotional', 'appeal', 'still', 'enjoy', 'watch', 'now', 'then', '5', 'stars', 'one']",N/A
1229461,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B001PR0Y6W,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[2, 4]","Movie - 5.0Paul Rudd and Jason Segel have recently become two very funny guys I've come to respect for their screen presence and comedic ability. Rudd is very subtle and can do a lot of things from being the snide and cynical jackass (a la Role Models) to the goofy and tripped out hippie (a la Forgetting Sarah Marshall). Segel brings much of the same to the table, but portrays it with a more masculine tone that's also deceptively feminine at times. His balance of vulnerability and balls (as in ""attitude,"" not those ""balls"") in Sarah Marshall was a great quality to watch, and I'm glad to see a sort of spiritual progression of those traits into I Love You, Man. With that said, the two pair up again for, what I think is, one of the funniest comedies, and certainly one of the best bromantic comedies I've seen. I Love You, Man is about a man named Peter Klaven (Rudd) who's getting married, but doesn't have a single guy friend to join him down the aisle. Disturbed and embarrassed by this revelation, he sets out on a quest to meet as many guys as possible in an effort to find his new best friend. Enter Sydney Fife (Segel), a private investor with a lot of sense on how the male mind operates, a penchant for doing guy things, and a Man Cave of wonders, who befriends Peter. They become very close buddies, but in the process, Peter starts to stray away from his fianc&eacute; (Rashida Jones) little by little until things finally work out by the wedding day.Without telling the whole story, let me just highlight the pros of the film. It's a guy's movie in the fullest sense, maybe even a little enjoyable for the gals, but definitely one for the guys. It's a story about a really (and I mean extremely) socially awkward, but nice guy with good intentions just looking to make a friend. In finding this friend, the movie also says a lot about how the unwritten rule of ""boundaries"" apply in relationships, be they with our mate or best friend. It's not just a hilarious and raunchy comedy with a few of life's little truths, but also a look at ourselves (guys, that is) and the fine line we need to maintain in order to live healthier and more balanced social lives. And with a stupendous cast of comedic actors (Andy Samberg, Tom Lennon, Rob Huebel, Joe Lo Truglio, and a perfect deadpan Jon Favreau), how can you not have fun? I get a lot of laughs every time I see it, but it never wears out its welcome. It's definitely one of my top comedies.Video - 4.5- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC- Video resolution: 1080p- Aspect ratio: 1.78:1- Original aspect ratio: 1.85:1For a slice-of-life bromantic comedy, I'm surprised at just how good the picture quality is. Then again, with very little to do in terms of special effects, sound design, and overall marketing, I would guess a good deal of the money becomes very well-invested into film stock and camera equipment. Shot on 35mm and processed digitally at 2K, I Love You, Man actually looks excellent. The quality I enjoy the most about this transfer is its clarity. Detail is very sharp and revealing with just a little bit of film grain to give it that theatrical feel. You can see all the little layers and lines in peoples' clothes, hair, face, and particularly in their body shapes like Segel's sport coat and his protruding gut and ever-so-slight man boobs, Favreau's Jew-fro, Huebel's overly fake tan, and the occasional curvaceousness of Jaime Pressly or the bulging muscles of Lou Ferrigno. Colors are somewhat vibrant, but are natural enough to add a sense of liveliness to the feel of the movie. The sunny skies and warmness of Los Angeles offer up mostly orange and yellowish hues during outdoor and daytime shots, while darker or indoor scenes such as houses, restaurants, and the Man Cave use more browns, grays, dark greens and blues, and black.And to top things off in terms of primaries, there's a good deal of red during the Rush concert in the ambient lighting. Black levels aren't amazingly deep, but are balanced well enough with contrast that you can differentiate a good majority of lines, shadows, and detail within certain sequences. The only downside to the picture is some sporadic glare/flare from the artificial lighting used during the shots that were actually filmed at night (like the gym scene, which was actually shot in the very early AM hours). Because of that, it tends to create something of an overly bright ""shine"" effect from certain camera angles that take away some of the detail. It's not a transfer that will really wow your guests, per se, but I found it very pleasing and think that it compliments the movie's storytelling well enough. Also, there were a few visual effects tinkered into film (listen to the commentary to find out which ones), but I sure as heck couldn't tell, aside from the obvious projectile puke.Audio - 4.0Languages- English: Dolby TrueHD 5.1- French: Dolby Digital 5.1- Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1Subtitles- English, English SDH, French, Spanish, PortugueseThe audio is a bit more underwhelming than the video, but this TrueHD track does a very good job in terms of general ambiance. It's a very music-centric track with a lot of record label songs and something like 6-7 minutes of actual score by Theodore Shapiro that make for a feel-good, laid-back kind of viewing. A majority of the music emanates from the front side speakers with some accompaniment from the rears, though only the Rush concert really ever takes advantage of such a design. Directionality is very sparse when it comes to the use of sound effects, as it's just not the kind of movie that uses them a lot, so don't expect to hear much more than Sydney's Vespa buzzing about with cars and a light breeze in the background, the cheering crowd at the L.A. Galaxy game, or the occasional bit of noise from the bystanders and skaters at Venice's Ocean Front Walk. Dialogue is probably the only other highlight outside of the music and is very clear and discernible, most notably Paul Rudd's light mumbles and his hilarious/awkward one-liners that always seem to sound like a leprechaun. Separation boils down to said music and dialogue and is never, ever a problem.It's a simple sound design with very little complexity to worry about. As for LFEs, I was actually very surprised at how much were present in a lot of the bass parts of the songs. I could even feel them through my couch with my feet off the floor, which is a big surprise considering the nature of the material. Of special note for LFEs, of course, is the above mentioned Rush concert in which we actually do get to hear Limelight in lossless audio. Lifeson and Lee's guitars sound great, but Peart's masterful drumming is done some serious justice for the bass and sounds absolutely wonderful for as short a scene as that is. I Love You, Man's audio presentation isn't something to showcase, but it's quite adequate for whats the film is. Fans of Rush will be especially Geddy, uh.. giddy to hear Limelight and a funny cover of Tom Sawyer by Rudd and Segel in the middle of the movie as well as their cover of Limelight during the wedding reception in the ending credits.Extras - 4.0- Audio Commentary (Director Jon Hamburg; Actors Paul Rudd and Jason Segel)The 3 guys are pretty jovial, with Hamburg doing most of the talking initially. He provides a lot of technical information about shooting, location scouting, and some of the set designs, but gradually sprinkles in some anecdotes about how he met this or that person, a little story of how he came up with certain ideas for this movie in particular, how much of an honor it was to get Rush to be in the movie, and how much fun he had making the film in general. Rudd talks a little bit about the approach he took to making his character seem as awkward as possible and how he tried to use a lot of improv to make his deliveries that much funnier. He also shares the occasional anecdote about events that took place during shooting and what it was like working with a particular group of people in a particular part of the movie. Segel stays quiet for the most until his character shows up in the movie, but he does pretty much the same as Rudd in terms of vocal contributions (lots of anecdotes and joking around). Overall, there's not a whole lot of dead space, and the trio does a pretty good job staying focused and giving out some interesting tid bits of information about making the movie. Though in all honesty, I wish could've been livelier based on how funny they were on the screen.- The Making of I Love You, Man (HD; 17:29)A fairly broad, but slightly engrossing segment showing interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. It mostly covers background information for the characters of Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Jon Favreau, and Andy Samberg (with special mention of how they inserted the projectile puke via green screen). It also shows how the actors tried to develop on-screen chemistry, a little interview with Lou Ferrigno, trivia on the Man Cave and why they specifically chose Rush to be in the film, and some general reaction/praises from cast and crew in working with Jon Hamburg. It's actually not a bad feature considering the film's content (a raunchy bromantic comedy).-Extras (HD; 22:25)These are essentially alternate and additional takes on certain scenes of the movie. Some are so-so, while others are pretty funny. My favorites would be the 'Barry & Denise' and 'Riding Marlena' segments. I like 'Barry & Denise' for the cynical, yet lovingly dirty-mouthed bickering (which I think Favreau is great at) and 'Riding Marlena' for some more of that Peter Klaven-awkwardness (with even a little bit from Fife, particularly how they argue about the architecture of Italy). Here's what's included, and all are in HD:- Whole Bunch of Tongue (1:22)- This Is My Nightmare (1:34)- Barry & Denise - America's Sweethearts (4:04)- Tevin Teaches Peter The Art of Selling Houses (3:31)- My Dinner with Doug (3:29)- Riding 'Marlena' (3:29)- Klavenisms (1:43)- Tevin Teaches Peter The Art of Sign Language (1:51)- City Slakka - Paul Rudd Tries To Get Through One Line (1:22)- Extended Scenes (HD; 12:39)Again, much like 'Extras,' these are just alternate takes of certain scenes. I actually think some of these could've work in the final version of the movie. My absolute favorite is 'The Wedding' in which Segel and Rudd go into a long-ish conversation about the acting career of Johnny Depp after Fife had just seen Chocolat (which I'm so planning to rent now, thanks to this movie). It's ridiculous, and yet so fitting for the tone of the story. Also, 'The Grove' is pretty funny in which J.K. Simmons and Andy Samberg come out of a theater to see Segel and Rudd hugging each other in a ""WTF moment"" while Tom Lennon walks by calling Rudd a whore. Again, all of these are in HD:- Ladies Night (1:01)- Engagement Dinner (1:36)- Tuxedo Shopping (2:09)- The Grove (0:52)- Rush Concert (4:16)- The Wedding (2:43)- Deleted Scenes (HD; 3:18)These are pretty 'meh,' since they're all fairly short. The Gay Bowling scene could've been pretty funny to have if Samberg and Simmons were given more screen time, though. Here are the scenes:- The Lost Man Date - Rugby (0:52)- Gay Bowling League Night (1:14)- Groomsmen Photo Session (1:11)- Gag Reel (HD; 11:25)A look at some of the goofs and laughs on set. And it looks like they had a really good time throughout the entire process of making this movie. It's nice to see them having fun.Overall - 4.5I Love You, Man isn't the first bromantic comedy I've seen, but it's a damn good one that manages to entertain in more ways than one with its adult humor, raunchy behavior, but also its storytelling about a socially awkward guy finding a true friend and living happily ever after with bits and pieces of life lessons in-between. Paul Rudd is quickly becoming one of my favorite comedic actors, and I really enjoy his diversity and ability to improv on the fly (especially with his voice imitations). Jason Segel compliments Rudd's kind of ""dainty"" character while also providing a manly and poignant wake up call of sorts, which was a lot of fun to watch as well. Definitely see this with your guy friends, and maybe even your girlfriend, then sit back and let yourselves laugh it out. The video transfer for this BD is excellent, and while the audio is mostly musical in nature, it still makes for a great deal of ambiance. The commentary could've been funnier, but the extra and alternate takes more than make up for what's missing. I Love You, Man comes highly recommended.",5,"I Love You, Man (Blu-ray)",1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,12538,"['Movie', '5.0Paul', 'Rudd', 'Jason', 'Segel', 'have', 'recently', 'become', 'two', 'very',

1229463,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B001PR0Y6W,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'I love you, man' reminds me of Seinfeld: it's much more farce than comedy. Like Seinfeld, the protagonists are likable but offbeat and quirky and the antagonists who oppose them are far more neurotic (proverbial 'damaged goods') than the protagonists. It should be noted that one of the co-writers is Larry Levin, who wrote for 'Seinfeld' back in the 90s.Peter Klaven (played by the amiable Paul Rudd) is a real estate broker in Southern California who's about to get married to Zooey (Rashida Jones). Peter feels embarrassed by the fact that he has no close male friends and is determined to find a best man for his wedding. It's made clear at a family gathering that Peter always felt more comfortable around women in contrast to brother Robbie who of course has no trouble meeting men and his father Oswald, who boasts about having a lifetime male best friend.Peter then goes out on a series of unsuccessful 'man-dates' where he meets one loser after another. One of those dates is Robbie's crazy personal trainer colleague who has a funny bit 'losing it' at an LA Galaxy soccer game. There's also another weird guy Peter's mother fixes him up with; it turns out he's gay and ends up kissing Peter outside the restaurant they went to for dinner. This character pops up later and he's amusing as a frustrated stalker.Less successful is the gruff Barry, husband of Zooey's good friend, Denise. Peter is reluctantly invited over for some male bonding at a poker game and ends up throwing up all over Barry after a night of drinking. I didn't really see the humor in the Barry character, as he is supposed to be some humorless macho guy who is continually reminding Peter that he doesn't fit into the world of male camaraderie. Finally there's Tevin, Peter's fellow real estate associate, who obnoxiously keeps asking Peter whether he'll consider going partners on selling an expensive house which Peter has been rep-ping for real-life actor Lou Ferrigno (TV's 'Hulk'). Tevin is not a very funny or endearing character especially when he suggests that Peter promote himself by putting his image on urinal cakes in well-known, local restaurants.It takes about 25 minutes into the film when Peter finally meets his 'bro', Sydney Fife, at an open house which Peter has organized in an attempt to sell Lou Ferrigno's house. Sydney reveals to Peter that the only reason he shows up at these open houses is for the food and to possibly pick up available divorc&eacute;es. Peter is drawn to the aggressive, single Sydney after he proves to be quite intuitive in discerning the true motives of some of Peter's prospective buyers. In a bizarre bit, Sydney observes how one prospective client sends his date to look at another room in the house as he doesn't want her around when he farts. Even when we learn that Sydney refuses to clean up after his dog defecates on a Venice boardwalk, Peter is more fascinated than repulsed by the extremely eccentric Sydney. Sydney's belief that dog doody is good for the environment is a turn-off but it IS funny when he morphs into a lunatic and begins screaming at the guy who tries to call him on his refusal to clean up, after his dog relieves himself.Peter proves to be just as quirky as Sydney but in a much more good-natured way. One of Peter's perennial tics is his blurting out of things he doesn't mean to say as well as assigning nicknames to Sydney which make no sense. For awhile, Sydney's single life proves attractive to Peter. They bond at Sydney's cluttered bachelor pad even though Sydney reveals he has a small 'station' in his house reserved for masturbation. Peter also has no objection to Sydney's firm conviction that no discussions about their sex lives are off-limits. The only 'normal' thing that the odd couple seem to share is a love for the rock band 'Rush'. After revealing that he used to play bass in high school, Peter accompanies Sydney (who plays guitar), as they jam to Rush songs at the bachelor pad.Eventually, Sydney's confrontational style gets Peter into hot water at his engagement party. Cryptically, Sydney reveals that Peter is somewhat unhappy with Zooey as she doesn't appear to enjoy oral sex. Peter escapes Zooey's condemnation during the car ride home, when he calls her on her earlier revelations of their sex life to her friends.Peter and Sydney's relationship reaches its apotheosis when Peter lends his buddy $8,000. But he also plants doubts in Peter's mind as to why he's involved with Zooey at all. When Peter foolishly expresses the same doubts to Zooey directly, she leaves him to stay with her girlfriends. Peter has had enough, dumps Sydney and makes up with Zooey. Meanwhile, Sydney uses the $8,000 to buy billboard space, promoting Peter as a hot shot realtor. All's well that end's well when Sydney's efforts lead to a great amount of new business for Peter while Zooey ends up calling Sydney at the last minute to attend their wedding as Peter's best man.'I love you, man' loses its comic edge when Peter and Sydney get real serious and break up. The sentimental ending could have been much improved, had the film's scenarists decided to have Peter's life unravel more intensely than merely depicting the short breakup between him and Zooey. One alternative could have been to have Peter lose his job and then being saved after Sydney's billboard plan is brought to fruition.In the end, I wondered why some of the film's foul language couldn't have been toned down a bit. What's more, jokes such as likening Anwar Sadat to a dog can be interpreted as a true insult in the Muslim World. While not a laugh out loud farce, 'Man' has its moments of mirth.",3,Quirky 'bromance' vacillates between moments of mirth and outright crudity,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",2010,5684,"['***', 'review',

1229464,AWRGM17GTMND8,B001PR0Y6W,"Tyler S. ""Super-Review""","[1, 1]","This movie serves a lot of importance to me.  It isn't so much the comedic value, because it doesn't rank as one of the funniest movies I've seen.  The architecture of the difficult-to-obtain male friendship, is a topic that has been abandoned by filmmaking, till now.  This film is very realistic in its premise.  Finding a friend for a guy is no easy task, because being aggressive can come off as homoerotic.  Women, on the other hand, can ask another girl out for coffee without worrying about the other's perspective on the offer.  This is a topic that is in dire need of talking about.  All of us men are so alienated that it isn't easy to make new friends.  Instead of this movie being a hilarious comedy, which it is in parts, it becomes more of a expositional documentary of the male psyche.Don't let me steer you away, I Love You, Man is very very funny due to performances by Paul Rudd and Jason Segal.  If it weren't for these two geniuses the film would be a bore.  The supporting cast, which is impressive, does a great job as well to build a great intelligent comedy, and not a wacky gay-joke fest.  The akwardness of Rudd's character proves he can really act, and Siegal's performance is a claim for him being a present comedic king.  The great thing about I Love You, Man is that it has a heart and purpose.  It is a film that needed to be made to hopefully detach our homophobia as males, and just offer friendship more easily.  Thankfully there is enough genius improv to make the flick as hilarious as it is worthwhile.The Blu-ray is satisfactory.  I watched all the special features relatively fast, due to the small amount of such.  I do have to give credit though to the gag reel.  That has to be the funniest and well put together gag reel I have ever seen.  Great job Paramount!  The commentary is also one of the more entertaining commentaries out there.

1229466,A1XX1KKXH9W7I7,B001PR0Y6W,wolfgang731,"[1, 1]","Simultaneously raunchy and likeable, I Love You, Man is something that is still somewhat rare in Hollywood; a quality, side-splitting comedy conceived almost exclusively with men in mind.  Thanks to Judd Apatow and other like minded filmmakers like Todd Phillips who helmed this year's hilarious, The Hangover, the idea of a male geared comedy that is actually insanely funny, has depth and is populated with instantly likeable though highly imperfect and multi-layered characters is not such an improbable concept any longer.  Yes, there are a couple of gross outs gags (but boy are they freaking hilarious) and some of the dialogue is undeniably raunchy but it's true to life.  More often than not, it's how men interact with one another, granted albeit without the really funny observations and clever metaphors; however, it's honest in that it doesn't either glorify the crassness that is a unique component of the friendship between men or gloss over it with a broad stroke of faux respectability in order to appeal to a wider demographic.  It simply is what it is, warts (not literal) and all.  In short, it depicts men the way they are (most men, anyway) and it does so free of prejudice or chastisements.  I won't rehash the plot because it's well known and has been summarized by far more proficient reviewers than myself, so I'll stick to the characters and the actors who portray them.  No one plays this type of role more convincingly and honestly than Paul Rudd.  His Peter Klaven is the sensitive, kind, yet awkward, and somewhat insecure guy that women say they want but really mow down on their way to the misogynistic a-hole who'd sooner put out a cigarette on her scalp than show her an ounce of respect and he does it with the kind of sincerity and commitment that makes his character not only likeable but relatable.  Never annoying, he's the shy every man who wants to be part of the ""in crowd"" but simply doesn't know how to function in an unknown environment.  You not only believe him every step of the way but you're totally rooting for him.  Jason Segel as Sydney, the raging yang to Peter's sobering ying, is fantastic.  As much as I loved him in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, I thought he totally rocked as Peter's best bud and mentor. This was a match made in heaven and the on-screen chemistry these two actors shared must be a director's dream.  The ease with which these very desperate characters interact is seemingly organic.  It seldom, if ever, comes across as contrived.  In fact, for me, nothing in the film had a whiff of artifice.  A quick aside, the scenes between Jon Favreau's hateful Barry and Jaime Pressly's feisty Denise were some of my favorites.  The same is true of J.K. Simmons as Peter's shoot from the hip father, Oswald Klaven.  He effortlessly stole his scenes.  On to Zooey, Peter's girlfriend.  This was another very likeable creation played admirably by Rashida Jones.  More often than not in this type of film, girlfriends and wives are shrill, manipulative  shrews that seem to live exclusively to come between their husbands/boyfriends and everyone else in their universe and thwart whatever chances there might be to have a good time.  Yes, it can be very funny at times but it can also be equally tiresome.  More often than not, as the viewer you just want to reach into the screen and beat the living excrement out of her.  In this instance that couldn't be further from the truth.  She wants Peter to have friends and to be independent rather than clingy and henpecked.  But jealousy starts rearing its ugly head when she feels Peter's attachment to Sydney is driving a wedge between the two of them.  Her concerns are valid and everyone, including Peter, knows that.  She never comes across as insensitive or more importantly irrational.  In short, this is a very charming and funny movie that manages to celebrate romantic love with the same zeal and humor as it extols the virtues of friendship.  One final comment.  Please keep your eyes open for the scene on the beach where the little girl tears into Sydney over his dog's ""indiscretion.""  I thought I'd lose it.
