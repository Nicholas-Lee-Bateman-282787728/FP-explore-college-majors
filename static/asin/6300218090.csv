224173,A2TXR85WQLE32N,6300218090,D. S. Thurlow,"[12, 12]","1984's ""Call To Glory"" was an astonishingly good TV movie that sparked a short-lived TV series and is long overdue for conversion to DVD.  It starred Craig T. Nelson as the commander of an Air Force Strategic Reconnaissance Wing flying U-2 spy planes over Cuba at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.""Call To Glory"" is only partially about the flying.  Nelson's family includes Cindy Pickett as his dutiful and loving wife, who shoulders with her husband the burdens of leadership in a business where husbands often don't make it home in time for dinner and sometimes don't make it home at all.  A young Elizabeth Shue is Nelson's teenage daughter, navigating the difficult shoals of early adulthood.  A middle son races jalopies at dirt tracks.  The youngest son is reduced to silence by his secret terror that his father will someday not return from a flight.  A live-in grandfather (Keenan Wyn) is a stunt pilot who secretly teaches the daughter to fly.The Cuban Missile Crisis threatens to spiral into nuclear war, terrifying the families on the ground and creating a demand for increasing dangerous flights over a Cuba infested with Soviet surface to air missiles.  The climax of the movie is a two-plane mission over Cuba, flown by Nelson with his best friend, that flies into a SAM ambush.  Only one plane will make it back.""Call To Glory"" is an old-fashioned movie in the sense of unabashedly celebrating the simple values of people trying to do their best because it might be important to their families and maybe even to the  whole country.  It is very highly recommended as a lost gem of the small screen.",5,The Last Full Measure...,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,1627,"['1984', 'Call', 'Glory', 'was', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'TV', 'movie', 'sparked', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'series', 'long', 'overdue', 'conversion', 'DVD', 'starred', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'commander', 'Air', 'Force', 'Strategic', 'Reconnaissance', 'Wing', 'flying', 'U-2', 'spy', 'planes', 'Cuba', 'height', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', '1962', 'Call', 'Glory', 'only', 'partially', 'flying', 'Nelson', 'family', 'Cindy', 'Pickett', 'dutiful', 'loving', 'wife', 'who', 'husband', 'burdens', 'leadership', 'business', 'where', 'husbands', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'home', 'time', 'dinner', 'sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'home', 'A', 'young', 'Elizabeth', 'Shue', 'Nelson', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'navigating', 'difficult', 'shoals', 'early', 'adulthood', 'middle', 'son', 'races', 'jalopies', 'dirt', 'tracks', 'youngest', 'son', 'reduced', 'silence', 'secret', 'terror', 'father', 'will', 'someday', 'not', 'return', 'flight', 'live-in', 'grandfather', 'Keenan', 'Wyn', 'stunt', 'pilot', 'who', 'secretly', 'daughter', 'fly.The', 'Cuban', 'Missile', 'Crisis', 'spiral', 'nuclear', 'war', 'terrifying', 'families', 'ground', 'creating', 'demand', 'increasing', 'dangerous', 'flights', 'Cuba', 'infested', 'Soviet', 'surface', 'air', 'missiles', 'climax', 'movie', 'two-plane', 'mission', 'Cuba', 'flown', 'Nelson', 'best', 'friend', 'SAM', 'ambush', 'Only', 'one', 'plane', 'will', 'make', 'back', 'Call', 'Glory', 'old-fashioned', 'movie', 'sense', 'unabashedly', 'celebrating', 'simple', 'values', 'people', 'trying', 'do', 'best', 'might', 'be', 'important', 'families', 'maybe', 'even', 'whole', 'country', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'lost', 'gem', 'small', 'screen']",Call to Glory VHS

224175,AQDN96EFME5J2,6300218090,"M. Larsen ""diamond""","[14, 14]","I religiously watched this show during my last year of high school. I watched ""Call to Glory"" for its accurate portrayal of the historical events of the 1960s--Vietnam, peace demonstrations, test flights on new jets--as well as for the  rich culture of those times shown through the characters. Every actor and actress in the series was top-notch, the writing fit the characters and the time well, and the show made you think you were in that time experiencing the tumultuous events of war, peace, new subcultures right along with the Sarnaks.This show really brings important historical and political events to life, and every episode should be available to everyone. Many of the episodes could be used in the school classroom.So please, producers, executive producers, directors, and everyone involved in making and marketing this show: please create and release DVDs for all the episodes. We need a true patriotic show in these times of uncertainty with the Middle East. We need to be watching shows that inspire us as Americans. Please give that to us on a few DVDs of this too short-lived but wonderful show.",5,Where are the DVDs?,1284076800,"09 10, 2010",2010,1113,"['religiously', 'watched', 'show', 'last', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'watched', 'Call', 'Glory', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'historical', 'events', '1960s', 'Vietnam', 'peace', 'demonstrations', 'test', 'flights', 'new', 'jets', 'as', 'well', 'rich', 'culture', 'times', 'shown', 'characters', 'actor', 'actress', 'series', 'was', 'top-notch', 'writing', 'fit', 'characters', 'time', 'well', 'show', 'made', 'think', 'were', 'time', 'experiencing', 'tumultuous', 'events', 'war', 'peace', 'new', 'subcultures', 'right', 'Sarnaks.This', 'show', 'really', 'important', 'historical', 'political', 'events', 'life', 'episode', 'should', 'be', 'available', 'everyone', 'Many', 'episodes', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'school', 'classroom.So', 'please', 'producers', 'executive', 'producers', 'directors', 'everyone', 'involved', 'making', 'marketing', 'show', 'please', 'create', 'release', 'DVDs', 'episodes', 'need', 'true', 'patriotic', 'show', 'times', 'uncertainty', 'Middle', 'East', 'need', 'be', 'watching', 'shows', 'inspire', 'Americans', 'Please', 'give', 'few', 'DVDs', 'too', 'short-lived', 'wonderful', 'show']",Call to Glory VHS
