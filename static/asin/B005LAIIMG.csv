The fast running, surging, and piling zombies worked within the context of this films story line. It was not stupid like I thought it would be. It was very well done. The Zombies in this film are very scary just like you want them to be. They do this really terrifying teeth chomping thing accompanied by horrifying screaming sound effects that cause goosebumps and chills. This film is very intense and very stressful at times. Nothing dumb here. Brad Pitt and all of this films cast has done a wonderful job making me believe the world as we know it was coming to an end. ""World War Z"" is about a zombie Pandemic that almost wipes out mankind is based on author Max Brooks popular novel by the same name.

1488512,AMGU3JP1CHFAC,B005LAIIMG,"Alan H. Markow ""a/vguy""","[0, 0]","I really loved the zombies in this movie.  Their antics, their spastic movements, and especially their clacking teeth provided plenty of comic relief to an otherwise tense film.  Brad Pitt is the hero (what else?) as the world fights back against a zombie epidemic.  Once you're bitten, you turn into one, so the Zombie population is rising like geometrically while the population of real people is quickly disappearing.  It's the UN that saves the day (don't get offended, UN haters, it's just a movie).  Although itself infested by zombies, one World Health Organization facility -- with Brad Pitt's help -- finds the cure.The best action moments of the film come as zombies attack the walls built around Jerusalem especially to keep them out.  They form themselves into human (well, zombie)  ladders to breach the wall and start biting Jews, Arabs and Christians with a genuine sense of equality.  It was heart-warming to see that all religions were equally doomed.  Pitt's series of Indiana Jones escapes from death were exciting enough to overcome the ridiculousness of the plot and keep you on the edge of your seat.It's a horror film, but it has a great sense of humor.  The good guys win in the end -- but that's probably not a spoiler for anyone who's ever seen a &#34;creatures invading the earth&#34; movie.  But those zombies can be truly hilarious, and make the entire experience worthwhile.This 3-D version, like the current crop of 3-D movies, is subtle with few minutes of head-ducking effects.  But, as with all the new crop of 3-D movies, the effect is used more for depth and beauty than for shock effects.  I'm not sure if this film was shot in native 3-D or just converted, but either way, it did a good job of conveying depth and included a few &#34;duck your head&#34; 3-D moments.

To make any zombie movie worthwhile it must be R rated. No bones about it and I will explain why.I Read the book and was aware this movie would take a different approach but I was a huge fan of the book and thought even a different take would be worth watching. Wrong. The book was done through the perspectives of various different people in different parts of the world. The different perspectives all progressed through the epidemic until the end of the epidemic from the accounts of various survivors. Every story was suspenseful and creative. The characters were rich and authentic and the material was all R rated.This movie takes the Disney turn and makes it all about brad Pitt. The sad CGI attempts did not help things any. A great example of how ridiculous this movie was is in the beginning where pit and his family meet another family who offer them shelter. The family have a little boy named Tommy. After the family declines Pitt's offer to join them they die at the hands of zombies. All except the boy who miraculously survives.What made this completely fake was that the boy never shed one tear after his parents die horribly and PItt shoots his dad in the head. Tommy is just fine and happily joins family. This was the most glaring example of how this movie has been diluted for the masses and I can name many more throughout the movie.Had they made this movie true to the book and with an R rating for mature subject matter you might have the next epic zombie flick.

1488581,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005LAIIMG,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","When I saw the trailers for this film it looked like one giant explosion after another with massive hoardes of zombies at every corner and Michael Bay ooze all over every frame.  In fact, I really had no desire to see the film at all, despite the fact that the source material was said to be an inspired work.  When news broke that the film didn&#8217;t really follow the book, it kind of solidified in me a reason to stay far away, and then the film itself was delayed (which is usually a bad sign) and with my wife opposed to all things zombies I didn&#8217;t have to worry about her Brad Pitt obsession to force me into a theater.I wish that I had seen this on the big screen.Yes, despite no real desire to see this at all, friends talked it up and so I wound up renting this the other night and I have to say, I loved this.Like, a lot.It takes something special for an action film to win me over in this way.  Yes, I enjoy the genre, but most of the films that come out of it are so generic and formulaic and redundant that you need only see one or two of them in a year, despite the fact that a good fifty are made each year.  They just keep coming and coming.  Zombies are all the rage now, but I have yet to see a single episode of &#8216;The Walking Dead&#8217; and the last great zombie film I saw was Boyle&#8217;s masterpiece &#8217;28 Days Later&#8217;, and that was way back in 2003.  Needless to say, I wasn&#8217;t anticipating much from this, even with my friend&#8217;s heavy praise.Where &#8216;World War Z&#8217; succeeds is in the staging.  I brilliantly makes this more than an explosive mess of chaotic jump scenes.  Instead, it balances out the action with true suspense, keeping the audience in true fear, not manufactured terror.  I can&#8217;t stress enough how rewarding this was.  I prefer a film that can get under my skin as opposed to one that throws everything in your face, and this film&#8217;s laboratory scene is one of the scariest in recent memory.The film follows an epidemic that reaches global proportions and threatens to wipe out the world.  Gerry Lane, a former UN employee, gets semi-forced back into service when a young kid with a bright idea needs a transport to Japan.  Things get muddled and soon Gerry finds himself mankind&#8217;s only hope (sort of) so he travels the globe in search of the answers to stopping this disease transforming the world into undead.Yes, there are some really big scenes here.  There are some breakneck paced sequences that show countless zombies racing down streets and clambering all over one another in order to feast.  They slam into buildings and cars and tear into flesh and they basically clutter the screen.  But those scenes are not what &#8216;World War Z&#8217; is about, at least not entirely.  There are many softer, smaller, quieter, scarier scenes that make this a very strong addition to the genre.  The plane sequence is breathtaking, and I already mentioned the lab scene, which is the best in the film.  The character development is minimal, but I like that the film doesn&#8217;t shy away from taking a harsh approach to the situation.  The ending could be deemed a cop out, and yet it is a lot better than magically curing the world.In fact, this film kind of reminds me of what would happen if you took Boyle&#8217;s &#8216;28 Days Later&#8217;, fused it with &#8216;Contagion&#8217; and gave it a glossy, Michael Bay, veneer.In other words; this film is VERY entertaining.",5,A balanced effort indeed&#8230;,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",2013,3474,"['When', 'saw', 'trailers', 'film', 'looked', 'one', 'giant', 'explosion', 'massive', 'hoardes', 'zombies', 'corner', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'frame', 'fact', 'really', 'had', 'desire', 'see', 'film', 'fact', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'inspired', 'work', 'When', 'news', 'broke', 'film', 'didn', '8217', 'really', 'follow', 'book', 'kind', 'solidified', 'reason', 'stay', 'far', 'away', 'then', 'film', 'was', 'delayed', 'usually', 'bad', 'sign', 'wife', 'opposed', 'things', 'zombies', 'didn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'worry', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'obsession', 'force', 'theater.I', 'wish', 'had', 'seen', 'big', 'screen.Yes', 'real', 'desire', 'see', 'friends', 'talked', 'up', 'so', 'wound', 'up', 'renting', 'other', 'night', 'have', 'say', 'loved', 'this.Like', 'lot.It', 'something', 'special', 'action', 'film', 'win', 'over', 'way', 'Yes', 'enjoy', 'genre', 'most', 'films', 'come', 'are', 'so', 'generic', 'formulaic', 'redundant', 'need', 'only', 'see', 'one', 'two', 'year', 'fact', 'good', 'fifty', 'are', 'made', 'year', 'just', 'keep', 'coming', 'coming', 'Zombies', 'are', 'rage', 'now', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'single', 'episode', '8216', 'Walking', 'Dead', '8217', 'last', 'great', 'zombie', 'film', 'saw', 'was', 'Boyle', '8217', 'masterpiece', '8217', '28', 'Days', 'Later', '8217', 'was', 'way', 'back', '2003', 'Needless', 'say', 'wasn', '8217', 't', 'anticipating', 'much', 'even', 'friend', '8217', 'heavy', 'praise.Where', '8216', 'World', 'War', 'Z', '8217', 'staging', 'brilliantly', 'more', 'explosive', 'mess', 'chaotic', 'jump', 'scenes', 'Instead', 'out', 'action', 'true', 'suspense', 'keeping', 'audience', 'true', 'fear', 'not', 'manufactured', 'terror', 'can', '8217', 'stress', 'enough', 'how', 'rewarding', 'was', 'prefer', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'skin', 'opposed', 'one', 'everything', 'face', 'film', '8217', 'laboratory', 'scene', 'one', 'scariest', 'recent', 'memory.The', 'film', 'epidemic', 'global', 'proportions', 'wipe', 'out', 'world', 'Gerry', 'Lane', 'former', 'UN', 'employee', 'semi-forced', 'back', 'service', 'when', 'young', 'kid', 'bright', 'idea', 'transport', 'Japan', 'Things', 'get', 'muddled', 'soon', 'Gerry', '8217', 'only', 'hope', 'sort', 'globe', 'search', 'answers', 'stopping', 'disease', 'transforming', 'world', 'undead.Yes', 'are', 'really', 'big', 'scenes', 'here', 'are', 'breakneck', 'paced', 'sequences', 'show', 'countless', 'zombies', 'racing', 'down', 'streets', 'clambering', 'one', 'order', 'feast', 'slam', 'buildings', 'cars', 'tear', 'flesh', 'basically', 'clutter', 'screen', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'what', '8216', 'World', 'War', 'Z', '8217', 'least', 'not', 'entirely', 'are', 'many', 'softer', 'smaller', 'quieter', 'scarier', 'scenes', 'make', 'very', 'strong', 'addition', 'genre', 'plane', 'sequence', 'breathtaking', 'already', 'mentioned', 'lab', 'scene', 'best', 'film', 'character', 'development', 'minimal', 'like', 'film', 'doesn', '8217', 'shy', 'away', 'taking', 'harsh', 'approach', 'situation', 'ending', 'could', 'be', 'deemed', 'cop', 'yet', 'lot', 'better', 'magically', 'curing', 'world.In', 'fact', 'film', 'kind', 'reminds', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'took', 'Boyle', '8217', '8216', '28', 'Days', 'Later', '8217', 'fused', '8216', 'Contagion', '8217', 'gave', 'glossy', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'other', 'words', 'film', 'VERY', 'entertaining']",World War Z

As a horror movie fan, there isn't much more that the audience can ask for from such a flick. The ending is rushed and comes to a premature halt, but we should be willing to let that slide. This is the start of a trilogy, of course! How many times do we get to see Brad Pitt lead such a blockbuster effort, especially of this type, nonetheless? Not many... Seven, Interview With A Vampire... That's it.World War Z borrows from many other genre films before it, but the influence of George Romero was most evident. Many scenes bare similarity with Day of the Dead, an oft-forgotten entry in Romero's ""Dead"" franchise. The beginning shares the white-knuckle suspense of Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake, and then moves onto 28 Days territory. The zombies here are unique in that their behavior is not humanoid, instead they act like ants, climbing and swarming all over themselves in order to overcome obstacles. They move super fast, and frequently throw their entire bodies at their victims, descending on them like bloodthirsty flying squirrels. The global scale of the epidemic is evident, though not as much as some viewers would like. Keep in mind that this is not Contagion. If the film was made to the exact specs of the book, it could have ended up the disjointed mess that was that Matt Damon flunker.Brad Pitt does not play an invincible killing machine. He is UN, so he is much more cool and diplomatic. The Unrated version is very action-packed from beginning to end. Brad Pitt shifts from focusing on his family's safety to focusing on the larger issue of how to stop the outbreak. His character shows what a cool head can accomplish in the instance of global disaster. The third act is more of a one-on-one showdown instead of the epic climax everyone had been hoping for, but overall the movie does a good job of bringing some novel ideas to the big screen.

1488646,A2DONKOXI3JU6A,B005LAIIMG,Ben Moore,"[0, 0]","Before we jump in, I saw this movie before reading the book.  At the time of this writing, I am almost halfway through the book and am very much enjoying it.There seems to have been quite a bit of backlash because this film really has nothing to do with the book it is based on.  And when I say based on, I mean they share the same title.  That really is the only thing they have in common.  There are a few bits of dialogue that are taken directly from the book, but that's about it.  I like to consider myself a bit of a zombie aficionado, no expert mind you, but I like a variety of zombie pictures from Dawn of the Dead to Resident Evil and 28 Days Later.  This movie fits in well and adds a few twists and turns that make it down right fun to watch.  I thought Brad Pitt did a great job.Now, if you only enjoy the classic, shambling slow as molasses zombie movies, this is not the movie for you.  These are sprinting acrobatic jump over cars and eat your face off zombies.  It definitely adds tension when you see a fast moving river of zombies racing through the streets and alleyways.  The story, I thought, was engaging enough and this movie is now in my rotation of semi regularly viewed zombie movies.  I believe the movie stands on its own merits and shouldn't be compared to the book.  The book is amazing as well, but a movie version of the book would be confusing if not downright boring as the only central character is collecting stories from around the globe meaning the entire movie would be quick flashbacks with characters you've never seen before.Personally, I find most synopsis of the plot in movie reviews to be annoying so I tend to focus on the &#34;if you like this, than you will probably like that&#34; approach.  If you enjoyed 28 Days Later, or generally are not opposed to fast moving zombies and you are not looking for a direct adaptation from the book, I think you will enjoy this movie.Before I leave you, if you happen to find yourself living through some kind of zombie apocalypse know this.  You MUST find the closest thing to Brad Pitt's character and stick to him like glue.  Going off on your own or doing your own thing will end very badly for you and your friends/family.  Going with Brad doesn't guarantee your survival of course, but it improves your odds and should add a hell of an adventure before you're killed off or turned!",5,Great Stand Alone Zombie Picture... not an adaptation of the book!,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",2014,2375,"['jump', 'saw', 'movie', 'reading', 'book', 'time', 'writing', 'am', 'almost', 'halfway', 'book', 'am', 'very', 'much', 'enjoying', 'it.There', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'bit', 'backlash', 'film', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'book', 'based', 'when', 'say', 'based', 'mean', 'share', 'same', 'title', 'really', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'common', 'are', 'few', 'bits', 'dialogue', 'are', 'taken', 'directly', 'book', 'like', 'consider', 'bit', 'zombie', 'aficionado', 'expert', 'mind', 'like', 'variety', 'zombie', 'pictures', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Resident', 'Evil', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'movie', 'well', 'few', 'twists', 'make', 'down', 'right', 'fun', 'watch', 'thought', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'did', 'great', 'job.Now', 'only', 'enjoy', 'classic', 'shambling', 'slow', 'molasses', 'zombie', 'movies', 'not', 'movie', 'are', 'sprinting', 'acrobatic', 'jump', 'cars', 'eat', 'face', 'zombies', 'definitely', 'tension', 'when', 'see', 'fast', 'moving', 'river', 'zombies', 'racing', 'streets', 'alleyways', 'story', 'thought', 'was', 'engaging', 'enough', 'movie', 'now', 'rotation', 'semi', 'regularly', 'viewed', 'zombie', 'movies', 'believe', 'movie', 'own', 'merits', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'compared', 'book', 'book', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'version', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'confusing', 'not', 'downright', 'boring', 'only', 'central', 'character', 'collecting', 'stories', 'globe', 'meaning', 'entire', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'quick', 'flashbacks', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before.Personally', 'find', 'most', 'synopsis', 'plot', 'movie', 'reviews', 'be', 'annoying', 'so', 'tend', 'focus', '34', 'like', 'will', 'probably', '34', 'approach', 'enjoyed', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'generally', 'are', 'not', 'opposed', 'fast', 'moving', 'zombies', 'are', 'not', 'looking', 'direct', 'adaptation', 'book', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie.Before', 'leave', 'happen', 'find', 'living', 'kind', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'know', 'MUST', 'find', 'closest', 'thing', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', 'stick', 'glue', 'Going', 'off', 'own', 'doing', 'own', 'thing', 'will', 'end', 'very', 'badly', 'friends/family', 'Going', 'Brad', ""n't"", 'guarantee', 'survival', 'course', 'odds', 'should', 'add', 'hell', 'adventure', ""'re"", 'killed', 'off', 'turned']",World War Z

In fact, I would say the movie has very little in common with the book other than the title and there are Zombies in it.  There are several things that bothered me about this movie.  I'll try no to spoil anything for those who have not seen it.  First of all, there are the Zombies themselves.  They move fast, which makes them more interesting.  I did like that part about them.  This way, you don't have to dumb down the characters too much to give the Z's a chance.  However, there is no evidence in this movie that anyone is ever eaten by one.  None.  That really makes them less scary.  They bite you and move on.  The main thing that makes a Zombie terrifying is the fear that you could be eaten alive and torn apart by one.  Take that away and what are they?  Not much.  A pack of Pit Bulls or a bunch of Fire Ants become more scary.  That's part of the problem with a PG-13 Zombie flick.  I don't like gore at all, but they could have found an imaginative way to give the impression that people were being devoured.  I know ""imagination"" is a bit hard to come by from Hollywood these days. The other thing about the movie that's puzzling is Brad Pitt's character.  There is nothing special about him.  There is nothing there that screams out that he's THE guy to solve this problem.  Anyone can do what he does in the film.  The only impressive thing he does is provide first aid to a severely wounded soldier.  Big deal.On the positive side, you do get some very good actions scenes and special effects.  Competent actors all around and some good thrills.  Story could have been better, but it's not horrible.  The characters in it are a bit better (smarter) than the usual morons you get in your garden variety Zombie movie.** SPOILER *** One thing that really ticked me off about this movie is the trailer for it.

It  jumped the sha...Zombie a few times before the end.  Korea part was okay, science guy inadvertently killing himself IN A ZOMBIE FLIC was dumb/lame/weak writing (you pick).  (random thought, why didn't the SF guys just get on the plane as well? They didn't want a chance to get back to America? Zombie outbreak and no one wanted to go Home?)The real flaw came from the Isreal part (no clue why this caused international outcry for the glorification of Isreal) because it was stupid ... the whole part ... nonsensical.  So Israel built a giant wall .. fine I can accept that! They let in the Palestinians so they wouldn't have to fight them as zombies later ... fine!  The zombies massing on the wall because of the singing ... WHICH WAS QUIETER THAN THE CHOPPERS (which weren't Apache gunships) flying overhead?  Then somehow the zombies gained super zombie strength to do two things.  One, not be squished by the incredible weight on top of them as they piled up the wall. Two, not be smashed to a useless pulp when they jumped from the top down to the ground below.The Airplane part was really the second Zombie jump in a row.  Where/When/How did a zombie get below? How did no one around the flight attendant notice? and how freaking convenient that Pitt and the wounded Israeli soldier survived.  Honestly, they should of let the plane land, zombie pops out as they unload cargo and everyone in England dies ... This would of continued the interesting trend of Pitt's character killing everyone around him everywhere he goes as soon as he shows up.The England/clinic part was pretty good in all honesty.I just didn't get the cure part.  Meningitis was a mask for the zombies? Then what about everyone else who suffers from a disease?  Why don't people with STD's get a pass from the zombies?I loved the Dawn of the Dead remake. Why you ask? Because it was a simple OMG zombies everywhere lets just try to survive and escape.  Because of that there weren't very many issues/plot hole created.

There is no Zombie disease, but the notion of a pandemic is entirely too possible. That sliver of possibility makes all the unlikely occurrences easy to accept, once you go along with the basic premise. In contrast, the premise of &#34;Rim&#34; is pure Sci-Fi. Pure imagination. There have been several good speculative stories written about robot design which indicate that the best design for a killer robot would look much more like an Abrams M1A1 tank than like a Terminator. Even the underlying premise, of a dimensional portal between two tectonic plates is largely fantasy. Pandemics we can buy easily. Dimensional portals, not so much.&#34;Rim&#34; is lots of gorgeous eye candy. &#34;Z&#34; turns your bowels to water at more than one place. The story runs from hope to hope denied to more hope to more hope denied. I came close to turning it off at three places, but I stuck it out. There is only one improbability in the plot which annoyed me. In the real world, it would have been colossal bad luck. But why put it in a fiction. Well, for the very same reason. It is the first lift of hope, brought down almost to despair, and the film is hardly 1/4 over.The movie is a well-choreographed roller coaster, with an amazingly plausible solution at the end.It may be the kind of movie you do NOT want to watch alone, and maybe you do not want to watch on Halloween night.",5,An Intelligent Apocalypse,1382659200,"10 25, 2013",2013,1643,"['thousand', 'reviews', 'am', 'not', 'likely', 'say', 'anything', 'new', '34', 'World', 'War', 'Z', '34', 'let', 'compare', 'favorably', '34', 'Pacific', 'Rim', '34', 'saw', 'night', 'watched', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Co.', '34', 'Z', '34', 'just', 'realm', 'possibility', 'Zombie', 'disease', 'notion', 'pandemic', 'entirely', 'too', 'possible', 'sliver', 'possibility', 'unlikely', 'occurrences', 'easy', 'accept', 'once', 'go', 'along', 'basic', 'premise', 'contrast', 'premise', '34', 'Rim', '34', 'pure', 'Sci-Fi', 'Pure', 'imagination', 'have', 'been', 'several', 'good', 'speculative', 'stories', 'written', 'robot', 'design', 'indicate', 'best', 'design', 'killer', 'robot', 'would', 'look', 'much', 'more', 'Abrams', 'M1A1', 'tank', 'Terminator', 'Even', 'underlying', 'premise', 'dimensional', 'portal', 'two', 'tectonic', 'plates', 'largely', 'fantasy', 'Pandemics', 'can', 'buy', 'easily', 'Dimensional', 'portals', 'not', 'so', 'much.', '34', 'Rim', '34', 'lots', 'gorgeous', 'eye', 'candy', '34', 'Z', '34', 'bowels', 'water', 'more', 'one', 'place', 'story', 'hope', 'hope', 'denied', 'more', 'hope', 'more', 'hope', 'denied', 'came', 'close', 'turning', 'off', 'three', 'places', 'stuck', 'out', 'only', 'one', 'improbability', 'plot', 'annoyed', 'real', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'colossal', 'bad', 'luck', 'why', 'put', 'fiction', 'Well', 'very', 'same', 'reason', 'first', 'lift', 'hope', 'brought', 'down', 'almost', 'despair', 'film', 'hardly', '1/4', 'over.The', 'movie', 'well-choreographed', 'roller', 'coaster', 'amazingly', 'plausible', 'solution', 'end.It', 'may', 'be', 'kind', 'movie', 'do', 'NOT', 'want', 'watch', 'alone', 'maybe', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'Halloween', 'night']",World War Z

Morse's acting during that first sequence was fabulous.  Pitt?  Well, he's okay, but the role he had, was just move move move, very little dialogue.Filmography, 5 stars;  directing and film editing, 3 stars, see next paragraph;  special effects, 4 stars (less, for the zombies), screenplay, -1 stars (NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, so no empathy with the characters), and film premise of zombie infection, -1000000000 stars.  Sound?  -11111111111 stars, either too loud or too quiet;  and puleese, someone remember that most folks will be watching this on monitors or LCD/LED TVs, so don't shoot everything so dark we can't see what's going on.Movie opening didn't allow audience to get comfortably empathetic.  Too fast.  It's like the opening episode of Falling Skies, which was also all movement -- idea to make you experience the thing, but puleese directors, give us characters we ATTACH to first, before laying on all that action which no one can follow...This thing could have been so much better with a different premise and better screenplay, which actually had a plot you could get into.  The slight sotto voce idea that Israel got protected first could have been done better, and came off instead as either a cheap insult or a cheap miracle.Not even worth finishing, but I'll force myself, since must attend computer registry cleaning;  then, will come back and re-rate, if required.  Believe it or not, they're making a sequel!  So there must be a lot of zombies who liked the first one.EDIT: finally finished watching.  Didn't reword the assessment above.

But then I often find myself unwittingly lending further credence to the aphorism A Fool And His Money Are Soon Parted.  Okay, so if by having skipped most of grade school you can bring yourself to believe getting bitten by anything other than a pit viper can bring about an instantaneous metamorphosis from normal biology to a state of &#34;undeadness&#34; (whatever that is), then, by all means, continue watching.  You will be treated to all the cliche characteristics of monsters who've been around for a hundred years virtually unimproved by any creative person's imagination:  gray, loping, limping, groaning, wrything, slobbering corpses with an inexplicable lust for the flesh of the as yet un-zombified.  (No, actually in this movie they appear to have been enhanced with turbo speed gear, compared to the standard zombie's slothful gait.  The better, I suppose, to make it &#34;possible&#34; to catch and infect the thousands of CGI extras it takes to make such a sucky movie these days).  How is it that in every disaster film there is always an escape route for the protagonist's vehicle through thousands of disabled vehicles? So, will someone please explain to me how Pitt's character is able to get from the deck of an aircraft carrier onto a plane the size of a C130 Hercules without first having to return to a mainland airport?  And why would you land the dadburned thing in a zombie-infested Korean facility without intending to rescue the few remaining military dudes?  Ah, and if you yourself were a zombie, would you have the forsight to hide away in the pantry elevator of a wide-body jet so that later you could wreak havoc in the economy section?  Why is it that the protagonist is always the lone survivor in the inevitable horrific crash of a fully loaded plane?  Then, when it seems like all hope is lost, is the day always gloriously saved by such implausible gimmickry as is desperately employed in this drivel?  Mebbe.  Is it just all in good fun?

1488737,A3MU9G6YWKTGTA,B005LAIIMG,Cary L. Brown,"[7, 10]","I will start off by saying that I am a huge fan of Max Brooks' two ""Zombie"" books... ""The Zombie Survival Guide"" and the far better companion-piece, ""World War Z.""  Brooks created an entire world, an entire ""mechanism,"" and entire natural history...... and this movie has almost nothing whatsoever to do with Brooks' books.  Let's just be up-front about that.  I CANNOT UNDERSTAND why someone would choose to ""adapt a book"" and then produce a product with only one name (and two quotes from that character) re-used (and in different context), totally change the nature of the threat, totally change the nature of the narrative... WHY?It's beyond me.  It really is.That said...  as a ""zombie movie"" this film isn't bad.  It's not GREAT, either, but it's not BAD.  The biggest problems I have with this movie are with how utterly ludicrous certain elements of it really are.Brooks created a disease... including the cause of that disease, a virus called ""Solanum"" which has been present on Earth since the beginnings of the human race, but which (until the advent of modern high-speed transportation) has always resulted in small, localized outbreaks, never in a world-wide collapse.  Key to this is that the reanimated dead are, at most, SIMPLY HUMAN.  They are not, in any way, SUPERHUMAN.  If the human body cannot do something when alive, it cannot do it when dead and reanimated, either.  And in many cases, especially as the body breaks down, these abilities become less... and NEVER become more.While Brooks' zombies never tire, exactly, they also never heal...  which means that muscle strength decreases, often dramatically, over time.They decompose slowly, because the virus (Solanum) is deadly to ALL LIVING THINGS, including bacteria and insects, and thus most living things instinctively flee from an infection, or are killed immediately if they don't flee and come into contact with it (the partial exception being humans, which are ""killed and then reanimated"" rather than merely killed.)But the zombies in this film are ""SUPER-ZOMBIES!!!!""  (Duh-duh-DAAAAAH!!!)  They can do things no human body could do, even at its prime.  They can burst through plate glass which would be physically impossible for a living human to break.  They can climb up walls which no number of living humans could climb up.  A charging group of them can ""churn"" over a bus, flipping it in the process.  They can run and leap far, far faster than any mortal human can.Heck, I'm surprised that none of them were able to FLY in this film!Further, Brooks' zombies die in a process which is pretty well-established, and which makes a certain degree of sense.  From initial contact to death is usually around 24 hours, with reanimation usually happening at some point before three more hours pass in most cases.  You can imagine Solanum reproducing within the body at that sort of rate... it requires no MAGIC to happen.  But there is no microorganism ever seen, or even IMAGINED, which can reproduce at the rate seen in this film.  From twenty-four-plus hours, we now see ""twelve seconds"" to a fully transformed zombie.So... if you hope to be able to ""willfully suspend your disbelief"" while watching this film...  and if you have the slightest grasp of biology at any level...  you'll be unable to do so, PERIOD.Further, they came up with a ""Deux Ex Machina"" solution which was made necessary by the ""SUPERZOMBIE"" nature of the reanimated in this film...  which is just ludicrous and, again, totally inconsistent with real biology at any possible level.SO...  there you go.But on the POSITIVE SIDE... you have good characterizations, a reasonable amount of fairly interesting storytelling, and some real chills and thrills along the way.Yes, it's predictable.  Yes, it's trite at times.  And yes, it relies far, far too much on CGI-created visual spectacle and not enough on solid storytelling principles.  And it's one of the most scientifically laughable movies ever made in the ""zombie"" genre (and that's saying something, isn't it!)But... if you can put those aside, it's still a movie which you'll probably enjoy, just because you really do come to care about who these people are and what happens to them (unlike most zombie flicks ever made).I do not encourage anyone to take this seriously...  but if you want some brainless, light entertainment, it's not a bad choice.On the other hand, if you're the type who enjoys deep, multi-layered storytelling (not about ""I woke up and was chased by zombies all day"" but rather ""what happens to human society when pushed beyond the breaking point?"") you should pick up Brooks' book(s).  Or even better, get the unabridged audio book version (the abridged versions are nice, too, but to get the full story, and see how it all relates, you really want the unabridged versions).The audiobooks are really remarkable, in fact, for having a full cast presentation.  Realize, the book is written from the standpoint of a journalist recording interviews with survivors of the zombie war... aka ""World War Z.""  It's done in that tone... very much like you'd hear if the news did interviews with 9/11 survivors today.  The stories are arranged to tell the story of the whole war, both in chronological terms and also in ""conceptual terms"" (with sections describing their purpose, like one entitled ""Warning Signs"" and another entitled ""Blame"").  Each story is told in ""first person"" to the interviewer...  but the characters, and the full cast of big-name actors playing them, is widely varied, and no two stories are similar, really.You can enjoy this film, for what it is... but just realize, it's unrelated to the book, and the book is FAR, FAR more worthy of your time.",3,"Unrelated to the book it is ""based upon"" in any way... but not

Well, the movie was much better.The suspense was very intense from the beginning till the last 15 minutes. It vividly illustrated the term ""breath-taking"". Many times, I found myself briefly holding my breath because things happened so suddenly, quickly and terrifyingly.It also skillfully portrayed the word ""chaos"".The special effects looked so real that they made the film more chaotic and horrifying. They were done on a large scale. I had never seen anything like this before. For example, there were scenes from a chopper looking down on to the ground. I could see thousands of people being attacked by zombies. People were fleeing in panic in every direction. It happened to many countries. In another scene, I saw thousands of zombies piling on each other while scaling the border walls.Interestingly, there was no bloody scene. The horror was not built on blood. This made it's more distinguishing.Besides Brad Pitt, the acting of others was engaging too. For instance, in the last scene the actions of the people in the last building were believable.It also depicted family love. It's touching even though it's briefly done.Of course, it had many logical holes but they did not affect its entertaining value.The best thing about this picture was the theme.

This movie is pure action and suspense...never boring, never dull.  The term ""fast paced"" is an understatement when applied to this movie!However...perhaps therein lies the problem.  Could it be that this movie is a little TOO fast paced?  I think it might have been better if the movie had slowed down a bit in parts, so we could get to know the people a little better - know what they are feeling.In the movie, Brad Pitt plays a retired United Nations employee named Gerry Lane who is pulled back into service to travel the world in a race against time  (okay, a little clich&eacute;, but whatever...)  He must stop a zombie pandemic that is threatening to wipe humanity off the planet! In this pandemic, a person will turn into a ferocious man-eating zombie just 12 seconds after being bitten.Ahh yes.  More zombies!  More apocalypse!Brad Pitt does a fine job in this movie...but then, he always does.  It wasn't his fault that the writers did not include much character development.  In the movie, his character has a wife and two little girls - all wonderfully acted...however, I longed for more....I wanted to get to know these people better.Yes, the movie was fast paced.  The zombies in this flick are literally MANIC, frenzied masses.  These are not the slow lumbering zombies of past movies.  People could get away from those zombies!  Some might say that these ""modern"" zombies (reminiscent of the crazed creatures in I Am Legend)are scarier than those slow moving zombies of old.  I might politely disagree.  The old style zombies created more suspense.  Will the person get away or not?  The viewer didn't know.  Plus, the old style zombies seemed more disturbingly....human, as opposed to simply CG creations.However....that being said, the movie is still very watchable.  There is not a lot of blood and gore (like on The Walking Dead) so don't expect that.  This is a more ""high-tech"" zombie flick.  It's good - the acting is good - and the plot is suspenseful.  The first time you watch, you will probably be on the edge of your seat the whole time.So even though I had a few complaints about the movie, overall I would recommend watching it.  World War Z delivers great movie entertainment. I won't spoil the ending for you, since the element of suspense is what the film is based on.

Brad Pitt's production company bought the rights to it in 2007 and has been working toward bringing it to the screen ever since. First of all, calling it the largest budget zombie flick of all time isn't really saying that much since zombie flicks are pretty much the territory of low or no budget filmmakers to begin with. Then you throw in Brad Pitt and put it into the middle of the summer blockbuster season and expectations go through the roof.So, what should you expect? Well, sooner or later, the zombie genre is either going to infect the entire country or drown itself in over-saturation. There are 8 zombie movies slated to release in 2013 and there were 25 released in 2012; most of these are done by low or no budget filmmakers, but the number of zombie movies out there borders on the ridiculous. Lets also not forget the highly successful ""Walking Dead"" television show. ""World War Z"" is a step up in quality, but is it all it's cracked up to be?Well just because it is part of the summer blockbuster season doesn't mean that it is chalk-full of action and events. It is a drama in its purest form. Many of the most action packed or awe-inspiring moments are revealed in the trailer and many of these trailer moments spoil some of the best surprises. Fortunately for ""WWZ"" though, its best moments aren't those heavy CG moments that are revealed in the trailer, but a simple scene where three lightly armed people have to navigate a building that is half infected or the moments that Gerry Lang (Brad Pitt) reveals that his true motivation is his wife and daughters.Despite a couple of really coincidental moments that caused me to roll my eyes a bit (including a plane crash caused by Pitt's character and of course his seat is the only thing that survives the crash), ""World War Z"" is well written, fast-paced and well performed. To compare it to other zombie movies is like comparing Pepsi-Cola to a lemonade stand; both are good, but one has more money. To compare though, this zombie flick may focus less on the gore and blood than others and Brad Pitt is a tremendous actor that makes this zombie flick better just by his mere presence.There's a catch to enjoying ""World War Z"" though; maybe two of them. First, you have to love zombie movies because it isn't anything more than that. Secondly, you have to lower your expectations. The movie isn't going to dazzle you in any way shape or form. ""WWZ"" is a human-interest story with the addition of really intense fast moving bloodthirsty zombies.",3,OVER SATURATED GENRE AND NOTHING NEW BROUGHT TO THE TABLE,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,2620,"['Dubbed', 'largest', 'budget', 'zombie', 'flick', 'time', 'much', 'expectation', 'surrounding', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'production', 'company', 'bought', 'rights', '2007', 'been', 'working', 'bringing', 'screen', 'ever', 'First', 'calling', 'largest', 'budget', 'zombie', 'flick', 'time', ""n't"", 'really', 'saying', 'much', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'territory', 'low', 'budget', 'filmmakers', 'begin', 'Then', 'throw', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'put', 'middle', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'season', 'expectations', 'go', 'roof.So', 'what', 'should', 'expect', 'Well', 'sooner', 'later', 'zombie', 'genre', 'either', 'going', 'infect', 'entire', 'country', 'drown', 'over-saturation', 'are', '8', 'zombie', 'movies', 'slated', 'release', '2013', 'were', '25', 'released', '2012', 'most', 'are', 'done', 'low', 'budget', 'filmmakers', 'number', 'zombie', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'borders', 'ridiculous', 'Lets', 'also', 'not', 'forget', 'highly', 'successful', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'television', 'show', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'step', 'up', 'quality', 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'Well', 'just', 'part', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'season', ""n't"", 'mean', 'chalk-full', 'action', 'events', 'drama', 'purest', 'form', 'Many', 'most', 'action', 'packed', 'awe-inspiring', 'moments', 'are', 'revealed', 'trailer', 'many', 'trailer', 'moments', 'spoil', 'best', 'surprises', 'Fortunately', 'WWZ', 'best', 'moments', 'are', ""n't"", 'heavy', 'CG', 'moments', 'are', 'revealed', 'trailer', 'simple', 'scene', 'where', 'three', 'lightly', 'armed', 'people', 'have', 'navigate', 'building', 'half', 'infected', 'moments', 'Gerry', 'Lang', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'true', 'motivation', 'wife', 'daughters.Despite', 'couple', 'really', 'coincidental', 'moments', 'caused', 'roll', 'eyes', 'bit', 'including', 'plane', 'crash', 'caused', 'Pitt', 'character', 'course', 'seat', 'only', 'thing', 'crash', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'well', 'written', 'fast-paced', 'well', 'performed', 'compare', 'other', 'zombie', 'movies', 'comparing', 'Pepsi-Cola', 'lemonade', 'stand', 'are', 'good', 'one', 'more', 'money', 'compare', 'zombie', 'flick', 'may', 'focus', 'less', 'gore', 'blood', 'others', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'tremendous', 'actor', 'zombie', 'flick', 'better', 'just', 'mere', 'catch', 'enjoying', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'maybe', 'two', 'First', 'have', 'love', 'zombie', 'movies', ""n't"", 'anything', 'more', 'Secondly', 'have', 'lower', 'expectations', 'movie', ""n't"", 'going', 'dazzle', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'WWZ', 'human-interest', 'story', 'addition', 'really', 'intense', 'fast', 'moving', 'bloodthirsty', 'zombies']",World War Z

My recommendation, then, is to be sure and see it in a big-screen, great-sound-system 3D movie theater if you're at all interested in it--it will not play well on a small screen (which in my opinion includes even the biggest screen home TV, even if it's a 3D model).",3,"Forgettable fun in a theater in 3D, but that's about it",1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,968,"['Saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'shown', '3D', 'great', 'sound', 'system', 'most', 'part', 'enjoyed', 'there', 'even', 'watching', 'felt', 'more', 'was', 'just', 'long', 'amusement', 'park', 'dark', 'ride', 'where', 'things', 'keep', 'popping', 'out', 'ride', 'car', 'ambles', 'track', 'rather', 'movie', 'theater', 'watching', 'film', 'interesting', 'story', 'characters', 'care', 'Characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'keep', 'plot', 'moving', 'forward', 'are', 'never', 'fleshed', 'out', 'pun', 'intended', 'lead', 'character', 'Gerry', 'played', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'So', 'action', 'formidable', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'truly', 'amazing', 'never', 'really', 'grabs', 'gut', 'heart', 'obvious', 'was', 'meant', 'recommendation', 'then', 'be', 'sure', 'see', 'big-screen', 'great-sound-system', '3D', 'movie', 'theater', ""'re"", 'interested', 'will', 'not', 'play', 'well', 'small', 'screen', 'opinion', 'even', 'biggest', 'screen', 'home', 'TV', 'even', '3D', 'model']",World War Z

1488821,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIIMG,C. Sawin,"[7, 13]","Without reading the Max Brooks authored book that the film is based on, ""World War Z"" is just a $200 million zombie movie that had a ton of issues during its filming process. It's already developed a reputation for agitating longtime fans of the book since the trailers have already revealed that the film is nothing like its source material. It was expected to be as disastrous as the apocalypse the film predicted, but early reviews were surprisingly positive and offered a little beacon of hope in an otherwise dark tunnel.As a Muse fan, it was a welcome surprise to find out that lead singer Matthew Bellamy contributed to the film's soundtrack. What's disappointing about it is that it only seems like Bellamy contributed music to the opening and end credits while everything else in the middle mostly revolves around really moody piano arrangements.It takes little time for the world to be turned upside down, which is probably for the best. Hearing about how Gerry quit his job at the UN to make pancakes for his family or Gerry complaining about his family not knowing how to put dirty dishes in the sink isn't exactly a riveting experience. What's most impressive about ""World War Z"" is its size. You can literally see this virus destroy huge cities with vast populations. The creatures they become move in numbers like ants, sprint at full speed, and will often lunge off buildings or walls built to protect cities without hesitation. While the events are intense, the zombies are awkward. They throw their heads against car windows to try and get the warm, pulsating, fleshy center still found inside trying to survive. The raptor-like squawking is complete overkill. Their constant chattering and ant-like movement can be chalked up for trying something different, but the squawking seems pointless unless they were using it to communicate which they don't.Coming back around to the size aspect, the atmosphere of the film is really strong at times particularly in the apartment complex when Gerry and his family are trying to reach the roof; those claustrophobic hallways with the flickering fluorescent lights and flares being their only hope is unforgettable. There are moments of intelligence, as well. Their solution to the outbreak is fairly clever. The dialogue shines at times. Andrew Fassbach's (Elyes Gabel) speech about Mother Nature being a serial killer is fantastic.The film can't decide if it wants the viewer to sympathize with humanity or get lost in the swarm of zombies as Brad Pitt searches for a cure. The first 30 minutes or so are gripping and contain hints of intimate human relationships, but once Gerry embarks for South Korea it's just this wild goose chase while everyone who isn't Gerry just sits around and rots. Some scenes from then on have memorable moments, but feel like filler overall. It's also extremely disheartening to be watching a zombie film when there are no headshots shown in the film. If ""Warm Bodies"" from earlier this year wasn't proof already, ""World War Z"" throws the rules that zombies once had out the window. Humanity should falter in the face of oblivion during the apocalypse in zombie films. That's kind of the point. Without that sense of hopelessness, it just winds up feeling like another walk in the park.""World War Z"" doesn't end. It's the end of the world and the film stops in the middle of the story. At just under two hours, the zombie fan in you will wish for an extra 30 minutes just to witness some sort of closure. The blockbuster film isn't awful, but it doesn't have the balls to be a real zombie film. It deserves credit for always having a strong female character in every setting Gerry found himself in while a few of the ideas and some of the writing is commendable, but the film has too many noticeable issues; too many cooks in the kitchen without a satisfying recipe for disaster.

1488824,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B005LAIIMG,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[4, 7]","Brad Pitt has gone from youthful sex symbol to versatile actor and producer.  His biggest project to date is this filmic adaptation of Max (Mel's son) Brooks' novel, World War Z, chronicling a massive, worldwide zombie apocalypse. For a subgenre that has ranged from classic horror, (Night of the Living Dead), to science fiction, (Resident Evil), to modern updates, (Dawn of the Dead remake), and parodies, (Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead), this film represents a rare depiction of the zombie invasion as a global, mass annihilation.  Previously, these films focused on a small group of survivors (TV's The Walking Dead) with a news blackout and no idea as to the magnitude of the infection.  After publicized problems with the screenplay and director Mark Forster's (Monsters Ball, Finding Neverland) rough cut (particularly a climactic battle scene), a new ending was shot, and the result is a remarkably engaging film.Gerry (Brad Pitt) and his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos), ready their two daughters for school and get caught in a traffic jam in downtown Philadelphia. Suddenly all hell breaks loose and panic sets in amid an invasion of zombies who are bent on mindlessly attacking and converting humans into the undead.  As cities fall worldwide, the infection spreads exponentially with startling speed as the family flees to Newark for supplies and a lifeline from Gerry's former UN boss, but while the family finds a brief refuge aboard a US Navy ship, Gerry is called into service to find the source of the infection or risk having his family kicked off the ship as non-essential personnel.  Tracking down random clues across the globe in such disparate locales as South Korea, Israel, and Wales, the trail for a cause and potential cure proves challenging as time runs out on humanity.In many ways, this film, which shares much in common with pandemic tales as Contagion, Outbreak, and The Andromeda Strain, is more a thriller than horror, and that's not a bad thing.  Rather than relying on gross out murders and graphic blood spattered effects, this film looks at the bigger picture without sacrificing the more intimate moments of sheer terror, not an easy balance.  Don't let that PG13 rating fool you!  Some scenes are suspenseful and agonizing as the threat of zombies is ever present.The film, particularly in the Newark apartment scenes and an unbearable moment of truth at a World Health Organization lab, is like one big funhouse ride where the scares are just around the corner.  Other memorable set pieces include the opening pandemonium in Philly, which is well crafted and builds to an alarming level, a walled in city of Jerusalem stunningly challenged by a growing sea of undead, and perhaps the best moment, a horrifying passenger plane flight from hell that starts innocently enough but quickly devolves into an impossible situation.The film takes the scary notion of fast running zombies from 28 Days Later and adds even more lethal traits as in their ability to not only swarm like insects, but to hurl themselves with great ferocity at their intended victims even through car windshields.  Their victims aren't devoured as in other films, but rather a bite turns them into more zombies almost instantaneously.  They are also real sensitive to sound as Gerry learns at the worst possible moment.What distinguishes this film above most others is its smarts.  The script, while written by many hands, still shows an intelligent approach to a devastating crisis, and the dialogue never sounds phony.  Further, the film is like one big mystery with nature's clues in full view waiting for Gerry to piece together a solution.  Some of the plot points are a bit open ended and push the limits of plausibility, but things move so swiftly and convincingly, that most won't mind.The supporting cast is effective in brief roles with a strong turn by Daniella Kertesz as a soldier.  But this is Pitt's show, and he is the right leading man who has the presence and charisma to carry even a zombie film. Being able to improvise and display cool under pressure, he is the ideal savior that the world needs.  Perhaps his Gerry is guilty of being too perfect, but he does it so well.(It is amusing to note that Gerry and his family become guardians of an orphaned boy, and one wonders if Angelina Jolie was smiling at the parallels with her and Pitt's real life, nuclear family.)With a mega-budgeted production, the CG effects are a standout especially when creating the hoards of zombies, and there are many effective camera shots with some particularly startling, overhead views.  There is also great use of sound effects that add to the visceral chills while the brooding, pulsing music score (Marco Beltrami) complements the tension.A thrill ride from beginning to end, World War Z is a thoroughly entertaining, scary epic that takes the zombie lore and heightens the stakes with an impressive budget and a star turn by an actor/producer at the top of his game.",4,World War Z

And I was right.  What a monumentaldisappointment this film is in every way, beginning with the company that secured the film rights all the way to the endof the movie.  I know Max Brooks probably got a very nice check from this movie deal, but I'm willing to bet he'sshed a tear or two over how the film turned out.  Pitt's stale acting, the incohesive and contrived storyline, and thelack of character chemistry make for a very unnerving viewing experience, particularly for those of us who lovedBrooks' novel.

1488841,A3IIBE4D1VECWC,B005LAIIMG,D. Allen,"[0, 1]","I read the book World War Z and found it to be very nice. If I remember correctly, World War Z came from the Zombie Survival Guide which are both written by Max Brooks. If you read the Zombie Survival Guide first, the best part was at the end when Max Brooks explains various times in history when zombie incidents occurred. The stories followed to the letter how one is suppose to survive according to what Max Brooks written in the first segment of the guide. Later Max Brooks released a separate World War Z novel that is based on interview-like stories from various survivors who explain how the war unfolded and how humanity came out on top. The book is written in a way that takes a journalism approach to what unfolded as told by various people who participated in the event. It's so well written that it's very hard to tell if Max Brooks is actually writing about a real event, or if it's fictional.With that in mind, I wasn't sure what to expect with the movie World War Z. The movie concentrates on a single man and his effort to figure out what causes the epidemic and how to shut it down. His reason behind figuring this out is a bit selfish as he wants to protect his family and don't want him and his family losing the protection of staying on a aircraft carrier. His search goes around the world from Korea, to Israel, to Wales, and various other places. The point is this movie attempts to show a worldwide issue with zombies.The movie plays out surprisingly well. I personally found it good. Other zombie movies tend to focus in on gore and a group of survivors who kill off large population of undead. This movie isn't quite so in following that typical formula. It does have its gore moments, but the reaction from people tend to be a bit more realistic. Matter of fact, Brad Pitt's character is extremely vulnerable and he doesn't really even know how to fight them and many times he comes close and he's tries to avoid them as best as possible.The movie has some surprising support characters. When Brad Pitt first arrived to Korea, he met with some Army Rangers and Navy SEALs special forces to guard him. They were quite well done and while watching, it felt intense as they combat the zombies and attempted to get Brad Pitt's character airborne. I felt in some cases too many of the characters bravely gave up their lives. In just a span of five minutes, two special forces operator in Korea just knowingly killed themselves with little reaction or remorse from anyone.My favorite support character would have to been Daniella Kertesz's character who is a Israel security force. I felt they made an excellent pair and felt their relationship to aid each other was very sincere. Not to mention she was the only character that survived being with Brad Pitt the longest to the end.Overall the movie was surprisingly good. The ending was so-so but overall the entire movie had a nice touch and I felt that it didn't fall victim to the typical zombie movies that plague the market today of just blasting away at everything and everyone and somehow surviving in the end after a few of the party member being brutally eaten. The movie doesn't quite follow the book as the book isn't based on any single character but as a whole. I felt the movie sort of followed the book lead in that it provided a lot of different support characters each fighting off their own war against the zombies. Overall the movie is a good spin off of the book and I personally enjoyed it.

From the release delay of six months, to the rewrite of the entire third act, it looked as though the adaptation of the popular novel would turn out to be a massive failure, almost to the tune of $200 million. However, despite these problems, not to mention the extensive reshoots and rumors of heavy disputes between the director and lead star, World War Z is an entertaining and smart epidemic thriller that boasts a strong lead performance from Brad Pitt and some eerily intense action sequences.The story revolves around former U.N. employee Gerry Lane (played by Pitt) in a race against time as a deadly and mysterious pandemic threatens to wipe out the human population. While the world struggles to hold on, Lane traverses the globe in a search to discover the origin of the disease in hopes of creating a cure.I have to say, I didn't have strong hopes for this film. I'm in the minority of people who didn't enjoy the book, and after reading about all the issues during production, I was expecting this to be a total flop. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the movie for myself, however, as the production team made some great choices that ultimately saved the film from being a disaster. From what I've read, the entire third act was redone, and is one of the strongest parts of the movie. Instead of the original ending finding Gerry in a massive showdown with millions of zombies in Russia, the rewritten script leads our protagonist to Cardiff, Whales in a much smaller, and creepy, setting. This leads to a much more intense climax that is a welcome break from the absolutely massive set pieces earlier in the film.As mentioned earlier, Pitt is very good here, not only as the smart and resilient U.N. worker, but also as the caring father and husband who ultimately just wants his family to be safe. His wife, played by Mireille Enos, is also very good in the movie, although I think she could have been given more to do.Overall I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this film.

Parallels to social problems like climate change were to be drawn.  It was to be a political allegory.  Evidently everyone involved was prepared for Oscar nominations.Oy vey.  While traces of some of that still exist in the final product, we're thankful nevertheless that the suits at Paramount finally insisted that director Marc Forster & co. steer this zombie movie back to its popcorn roots.  We're also thankful that Pitt struggled through all the pre-production heartaches (too numerous and well-documented to list here) to get this entertaining film made.  It can be truly said that the opening action sequence, with Pitt and his family stuck in traffic in downtown Philly when the zombies attack, is destined to be considered a classic.  There a few good jump-scares.  I also liked the global sweep of the film, as we follow Pitt to Korea to Israel to Wales.  (Wasn't actually shot in all those places, of course.)  But some of the usual problems that come with too many script rewrites -- rewrites done after much of the film was finished -- are evident.  For instance: mid-way through the film, we learn that these zombies go &#34;dormant&#34; if they're not stimulated by sound.  But earlier in the film, a gang of zombies try to bust through the front-door of an apartment of a Latino family who have been quiet as churchmice.  And as for the movie's solution to the zombie epidemic?  I won't spoil it, but let's just say that someone might pour a glass of milk and *take a sip* before realizing that the milk has gone over.  There won't be an invisible shield around that glass.  So ... not very logical.  But then, we learn that our good friend Damon Lindelhof, writer of that epic piece of illogical crap known as &#34;Prometheus&#34;, rewrote much of the third act.  Figures.Speaking of illogical: are these things really zombies anyway?  I thought you had to be dead first to qualify as a zombie.  Instead, people turn into funhouse horrors within 30 seconds after they're bitten, and they're not killed beforehand.  This makes the creatures something else, in my opinion.Oh well.

They have effectively homogenized zombies. Herein lies the major problem: zombies = horror. If you're making a zombie movie it should have some scary things in it. The average horror fan expects this. While many aspects of the film work the bland presentation speaks to the motivation of capitalizing on a popular trend and emasculating it to the point you can get the youngsters in without parents complaining.The problems arise in trying to capitalize on a genre without really understanding it. In the theatre the final zombie confronting Brad Pitt was drawing derisive giggling. It was making facial expression similar to that of Ron Jeremy (those of you old enough to recognize the reference will understand the silliness) while making chattering noise similar to that of a dolphin ""laughing"".Another problem was that the zombies were constantly falling. They were falling over edges, off roofs, over each other: no chance to send one sprawling was spared. A minor distraction comes in trying to anticipate what they're going to fall off next.The best way to get a feel for what you're up against in ""World War Z"" is to take ""28 Days Later"" and drop it in a blender with ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". One has to expect this, though, the film is rating PG-13 (which was probably their first mistake). A properly done zombie movie is not for the whole family. Hell, it's not for most adults.They make a nodding concession by having one of the soldiers say, ""You can put a few rounds in their chest to slow them down but the only thing that seems to work is to get them in the head"". The problem is that they drop with shots to the chest. It seems the fear of ratings made the producers avoid explicitness you can find on primetime TV.What saves the film is the pacing. It moves along keeping attention easily by presenting believable characters and not becoming complacent.The best way to view this will be through ""Pay Per View"". The cost in the theatre was ridiculous for what was delivered. If I decided to go for the home copy it will be a year or two after release when it's lowered to the more appropriate price tag of $10.00. Anything else would leave me feeling exploited for a second time.***Spoiler***Part of the problem with homogenizing a genre is breaking the rules that makes it work. Brad Pitt finds a solution to the problem (not a cure) in the idea that the undead are trying to spread the infection. What ever side of the zombie debate you fall on (fast or slow, smart or stupid) nobody has dared to take the scare out of them by suggesting you can just inoculate against drawing their interest.",3,At Least You Won't Fall Asleep,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",2013,2728,"['best', 'thing', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'film', 'also', 'worst', 'thing', 'inoffensive', 'have', 'effectively', 'homogenized', 'zombies', 'Herein', 'major', 'problem', 'zombies', '=', 'horror', ""'re"", 'making', 'zombie', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'scary', 'things', 'average', 'horror', 'fan', 'many', 'aspects', 'film', 'work', 'bland', 'presentation', 'motivation', 'capitalizing', 'popular', 'trend', 'emasculating', 'point', 'can', 'get', 'youngsters', 'parents', 'complaining.The', 'problems', 'arise', 'trying', 'capitalize', 'genre', 'really', 'understanding', 'theatre', 'final', 'zombie', 'confronting', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'was', 'drawing', 'derisive', 'giggling', 'was', 'making', 'facial', 'expression', 'similar', 'Ron', 'Jeremy', 'old', 'enough', 'recognize', 'reference', 'will', 'understand', 'silliness', 'making', 'chattering', 'noise', 'similar', 'dolphin', 'laughing', '.Another', 'problem', 'was', 'zombies', 'were', 'constantly', 'falling', 'were', 'falling', 'edges', 'off', 'roofs', 'other', 'chance', 'send', 'one', 'sprawling', 'was', 'spared', 'minor', 'distraction', 'trying', 'anticipate', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'fall', 'off', 'next.The', 'best', 'way', 'get', 'feel', 'what', ""'re"", 'up', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'take', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'drop', 'blender', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'One', 'expect', 'though', 'film', 'rating', 'PG-13', 'was', 'probably', 'first', 'mistake', 'properly', 'done', 'zombie', 'movie', 'not', 'whole', 'family', 'Hell', 'not', 'most', 'adults.They', 'make', 'nodding', 'concession', 'having', 'one', 'soldiers', 'say', 'can', 'put', 'few', 'rounds', 'chest', 'slow', 'down', 'only', 'thing', 'work', 'get', 'head', 'problem', 'drop', 'shots', 'chest', 'fear', 'ratings', 'made', 'producers', 'avoid', 'can', 'find', 'primetime', 'TV.What', 'film', 'pacing', 'along', 'keeping', 'attention', 'easily', 'presenting', 'believable', 'characters', 'not', 'becoming', 'complacent.The', 'best', 'way', 'view', 'will', 'be', 'Pay', 'Per', 'View', 'cost', 'theatre', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'what', 'was', 'delivered', 'decided', 'go', 'home', 'copy', 'will', 'be', 'year', 'two', 'release', 'when', 'lowered', 'more', 'appropriate', 'price', 'tag', '10.00', 'Anything', 'else', 'would', 'leave', 'feeling', 'exploited', 'second', 'time', '***Spoiler***Part', 'problem', 'homogenizing', 'genre', 'breaking', 'rules', 'work', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'solution', 'problem', 'not', 'cure', 'idea', 'undead', 'are', 'trying', 'spread', 'infection', 'What', 'ever', 'side', 'zombie', 'debate', 'fall', 'fast', 'slow', 'smart', 'stupid', 'nobody', 'dared', 'take', 'scare', 'suggesting', 'can', 'just', 'inoculate', 'drawing', 'interest']",World War Z

The storyline was well developed as well as the main character.  The remainder of the cast were as they were meant to be, supporting roles.  I believe these zombies are the best to date.  I'm a huge zombie fan & have an extensive collection of Zombie movies, mini series, & tv series.  The most important features of a Zombie as far as I'm concerned are make-up & movement.  The make-up wasn't as gorey as most other Zombie flicks but the movements were extraordinary.  They were extremely fast & they had ticks which to me took them to a whole new level.  Nothing like a full on global Zombie Apocalypse!  I will watch this movie many more times which makes this one a keeper.  This is the only Zombie movie I've seen where they actually came up w/a solution for the problem.  You'll have to watch & see to find out because there's nothing worse than someone giving you spoilers of a movie you haven't seen yet.  I gave this movie &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; stars because I felt the make-up could've been better.  My guess is the Zombies moved @ such a fast pace they didn't feel the need to go into great detail as far as the make-up was concerned.  I wholeheartedly recommend this flick to any & all Zombie fans.  I  would like to recommend a great Zombie mini series called DEAD SET.  It's takes  place in England & the majority of the film takes place on the Great Britain Big Brother  set.  Both make-up & movement are extraordinary.  Make sure if you're in the US that  it's in the Region I format or else it won't play on your dvd player.  If you have a multi  zone player then it won't matter what region it is.

There was no blatant political correctness and in fact if anything the military was shown in a positive light. Though Mr. Pitt may be the first and only U.N. employee to ever accomplish anything his heroics sure did a lot of bacon saving in this movie.In short I'm glad to see Mr. Pitt in something non melodramatic for a change or cast in some idiotic love-comedy. Oh, and there was probably the worst movie I have ever seen that Mr. Pitt was a lead actor in that also featured Kate Blanchette.......cannot think of the name of the dreadful movie but what almost became an international incident came down to be caused by two Middle Eastern children stupidly playing with a gun and accidentally shooting the usually very talented Ms Blanchette....on a bus....going somewhere for some reason....I think it was a tourist related trip (though why anyone would choose to take a bus ride through the lunar terrain of that part of the world escapes me, perhaps it was just to get out in the world and eat left handed while your wife gets treated like a dog).Back to this movie. The only thing that disappointed me was that it was too short. It was so much fun I could have gone another hour without even thinking about it running too long.

1488922,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B005LAIIMG,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[0, 0]","""World War Z"" (2013). . .We enjoyed this one - I thought it was a good, intelligent zombie flick, more in the hyper-realist mode of ""28 Days"" and ""The Walking Dead"" rather than the camp horror of the George Romero franchises. I'm not normally a big Brad Pitt fan, but I found myself drawn to his surprisingly understated (though impossibly hunky) NGO-veteran hero. The pace of the movie's first two thirds was intense, and intelligently built on the audience's familiarity with the conventions of earlier zombie epics. I also liked how all the characters responded to the crisis believably -- while the mobs around them panicked, the main players made methodical, rational choices, and their reactions seemed to ring true.The frantic pace of the movie's start and its terrorism allegories gave way to a slower-paced, pleasantly surprising and anti-climactic third act, which settled back into a more conventional zombies-as-public-health narrative... I'm sure a lot of the negative reviews here an elsewhere have to do with the relative lack of gristle and graphic mayhem, which fans weaned on the bone-chewing gore of ""The Walking Dead"" will consider a shortcoming. But there's room for all kinds of zombie flicks, and this one had a nice, epic scope, along with an admittedly soft ""Hollywood ending."" This didn't ruin it for me, although I can see where other folks are coming from. It's a thrilling blockbuster, though, and definitely worth watching. Grrr. Argh.

1488926,A14KINAPCA7XTL,B005LAIIMG,dmbTank,"[0, 0]","This movie is just another virus / zombie movie in an already crowded genre with some decent acting and action scenes to help keep it going. I particularly liked the scenes of zombies climbing over each other to scale walls.Here are a few things that make this film slightly different, but not better than other same type movies.1). The main character has to travel to various locations in his mission to find the answer; so at least you experience different settings and are introduced to new characters along the way, not that any character is all that important to the plot.2). Lots of zombies but no gore, Zombies want to bite you but not eat you. So, this is like a bloodless zombie movie.-- When the zombies are shot etc, the director makes a point of leaving out the splatter.  This concept of no visual blood letting, did not seem to distract from the film suspense or sense of danger.  One scene in particular has their hand cut off, but you only see the action of this being done and never the effect of the hand falling off or bleeding out, etc..3). Once bitten you have all of 9 seconds before you turn.  In other zombie movies it may take a few days. So, this infection spreads like wild fire.4). The main character (Brad Pitt) brought across a true feeling of ""family"". At the very start of the movie, his family's needs to be protected from the zombies, You can sense he has the parental nature in his acting which the movie captures well.Overall Thoughts:I have seen this same type of film at least a dozen times with a similar plots; of avoiding being bitten, while trying to save yourself,your fiends, and fight your way to discovering the answer to save the world. This movie has the same concept as most all of these type of films, and did not set itself a distinct.If you watched ""I am Legend"" with Will Smith you notice a difference; I am legend had infected vampires who lived underground and came out at night looking for the main character will smith, while will tried to find a cure in his basement.  In this movie ""world war z"" the main character travels to locations avoiding zombies while looking for the answer.  All these viral infected zombie movies have the same premise, and once you see a few you may find it harder and harder to enjoy the next remake, which was the case for me.This is why some SCI-FI movies have such a wide rating scale, some 5 stars others 1 or 2 stars, because if you only were exposed to one other similar movie, then you tend to become more engrossed in the movie and its characters and may rate it higher.  I rated it 3 stars because the plot seem lifted from ""_______ ______ zombie movie, with a different director and actors.So is this a bad movie?  No not really. It suffers from the fact that many other movies have been done already and in some cases they did it slightly better.",3,zombies without the gore,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",2014,2844,"['movie', 'just', 'virus', '/', 'zombie', 'movie', 'already', 'crowded', 'genre', 'decent', 'acting', 'action', 'scenes', 'help', 'keep', 'going', 'particularly', 'liked', 'scenes', 'zombies', 'climbing', 'other', 'scale', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'make', 'film', 'slightly', 'different', 'not', 'better', 'other', 'same', 'type', 'movies.1', 'main', 'character', 'travel', 'various', 'locations', 'mission', 'find', 'answer', 'least', 'experience', 'different', 'settings', 'are', 'introduced', 'new', 'characters', 'way', 'not', 'character', 'important', 'plot.2', 'Lots', 'zombies', 'gore', 'Zombies', 'want', 'bite', 'not', 'eat', 'So', 'bloodless', 'zombie', 'movie.', 'When', 'zombies', 'are', 'shot', 'etc', 'director', 'point', 'leaving', 'out', 'splatter', 'concept', 'visual', 'blood', 'letting', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'distract', 'film', 'suspense', 'sense', 'danger', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'hand', 'cut', 'off', 'only', 'see', 'action', 'being', 'done', 'never', 'effect', 'hand', 'falling', 'off', 'bleeding', 'out', 'etc..3', 'Once', 'bitten', 'have', '9', 'seconds', 'turn', 'other', 'zombie', 'movies', 'may', 'take', 'few', 'days', 'So', 'infection', 'wild', 'fire.4', 'main', 'character', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'brought', 'true', 'feeling', 'family', 'very', 'start', 'movie', 'family', 'needs', 'be', 'protected', 'zombies', 'can', 'sense', 'parental', 'nature', 'acting', 'movie', 'well.Overall', 'Thoughts', 'have', 'seen', 'same', 'type', 'film', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'similar', 'plots', 'avoiding', 'being', 'bitten', 'trying', 'save', 'fiends', 'fight', 'way', 'discovering', 'answer', 'save', 'world', 'movie', 'same', 'concept', 'most', 'type', 'films', 'did', 'not', 'set', 'distinct.If', 'watched', 'am', 'Legend', 'Will', 'Smith', 'notice', 'difference', 'am', 'legend', 'had', 'infected', 'vampires', 'who', 'lived', 'underground', 'came', 'out', 'night', 'looking', 'main', 'character', 'will', 'smith', 'will', 'tried', 'find', 'cure', 'basement', 'movie', 'world', 'war', 'z', 'main', 'character', 'travels', 'locations', 'avoiding', 'zombies', 'looking', 'answer', 'viral', 'infected', 'zombie', 'movies', 'have', 'same', 'premise', 'once', 'see', 'few', 'may', 'find', 'harder', 'harder', 'enjoy', 'next', 'remake', 'was', 'case', 'me.This', 'why', 'SCI-FI', 'movies', 'have', 'wide', 'rating', 'scale', '5', 'stars', 'others', '1', '2', 'stars', 'only', 'were', 'exposed', 'one', 'other', 'similar', 'movie', 'then', 'tend', 'become', 'more', 'engrossed', 'movie', 'characters', 'may', 'rate', 'higher', 'rated', '3', 'stars', 'plot', 'seem', 'lifted', '_______', '______', 'zombie', 'movie', 'different', 'director', 'actors.So', 'bad', 'movie', 'No', 'not', 'really', 'fact', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'already', 'cases', 'did', 'slightly', 'better']",World War Z

I was very unsure, having been just about ""zombied"" to death--and most of them not good at all.  I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  I have not read the book, so this review is based solely on what I watched at the cinema.What starts off as any normal morning becomes anything but in a very short while.  Brad Bitt, with wife and two daughters in tow, begin some sort of holiday, but a monkeywrench is thrown into their plans almost immediately because of an outbreak of some sort of virus that is turning people into crazed maniacal zombies.  There is no known ""Patient Zero,"" no idea where the virus originated, and certainly no cure.  Pitt's character used to work for the UN in some sort of capacity, and he and his family are saved and taken out to sea for protection.  Pitt is asked to head up a team and search for the origin (and cure) of this disease.  Along the way, there are stops in South Korea, Israel, and Belarus.  Pitt's character comes up with an idea that might just save the world--or at least give it a little time longer to work on an antidote.  I won't give anything else away, but I will say this was one zombie movie that at least I could buy the premise.The acting is this movie fared much better than its script.  The plausibility of Israel seeming able to defend itself against the zombie attack long before anyone else and then not knowing to put the kybosh on their ""hoedown"" was just a little unbelievable.  And I left the movie wanting more--much more.  Coming in at just under two hours, you would have thought the story would have all been there, but the movie seemed to end just as it was starting to take off.  I'm sure most of you wanted more blood and guts (there is very little of this, by the way), but I was okay with the story taking precedent over the effects.World War Z is rated PG-13 for language and violence, and believe it or not, there's not that much violence.

The two have little to nothing in common, and that can be a good thing and a bad thing but why cant both be good? They both are good. I do believe they need to make a movie from the book but it may have to be too intelligent for the average summer teenager crowd (the book is too sophisticated and intelligent for the Kardashian-honeyboo crowd). However, the movie isn't too shabby either for just a suspense-filled, exciting, well-acted popcorn pleaser. If you go in thinking its gonna be like the book, you'll prob. hate it, but if you see it as a separate entity, then its a rather tense, thrilling fun little gem of a movie. Never been a Pitt fan, but gotta admit, he does the leading man-hero thing quite admirably here. A Timberlake or Tatum wouldn't have worked, but Pitt makes a believable and resourceful hero and does it well. And gotta admit, The tough as nails Israeli soldier is prob. my favorite character in the movie, other than Pitt.

1488976,A1FYGS8JIQEZIF,B005LAIIMG,E. Gardiner,"[0, 1]","I am a fan of zombie and rage virus movies. I read the book, though it has been over five years. The pacing of this movie was slow and there was not enough suspense to keep the viewer engaged. I did not have high expectations after seeing the trailer for the movie, it seemed like it would be another horrible adaptation of a good book. I would like to split this review into two parts, positives (or things that did not seem bad or stupid) and cons (things that did not make sense).Pros1) Protagonist is a former member of the UN armed forces. Yes the UN does not have teeth and is not a well respected military force. However they do have a military force, it is made up of volunteers from the military of member countries. So no I do not think it stupid that the protagonist was a former member of the UN. He was most likely in the US military and then volunteered. He also was likely in vary dangerous combat areas along side US military, he had to have been trained in combat,2) It is not strange to look for patient zero, and to look for a cure. It was identified as a virus of some sort so trying to find its origins makes sense.3) The scene in Israel, I thought was done well and was the closets thing to the book that I can remember. No the zombies did not get smarter. They were dormant. There was not enough noise next to the wall to get them to think there were none-contaminated people on the other side. When the girl started singing and the other people started to join in. All the zombies awakened and rushed. They got lucky in that a good number rushed one area piled on to each other and were able to climb over the wall.4) Him and the Israeli soldier survived the plane crash. He was horribly injured which would likely happen.5) Using H1N1 to as camouflage  was pretty neat. Considering the closets things to zombies we have so far is a fungus that infects certain ants controls them so that it can spread but it tries to only spread to health hosts.5) The kids, acted realistically, one was scared to the point of silence the other to annoying cries. The hispanic kid  was important in that it showed Brad Pitts character wanting to help those who helped him. That kids was either very lucky or terminally ill.Cons.1) That the doctor brought to South Korea died so early on.2) The change from Russia is a black hole to India is a black hole was annoying.3) The length of time it took for the back of the plane to become infected and break out into chaos. The virus takes seconds to show signs and 10-12 seconds to complete the transformation. Unless for some reason the dog was the carrier it would have been known within seconds that one of the passengers was infected.  Not the hours it would take to go from Israel to Cardiff.4) The teeth thing the zombies do.5) I understand making one look terminally ill, but it would be hard to travel long distance while sick with H1N1 , unless they found a way to make your body show signs of being terminally ill without actually being terminally ill.6) Why did ingestion of the zombie blood not infect Brad Pitts character?7) Pacing was bad, not enough character development, not enough suspense.  Action scenes okay but could have been done better.",2,Boring and met my low expectations.

I love Zombie movies but I am not a fan of Brad Pitt.  Unfortunately, he is the star and there is no getting around that.  Fortunately, he is quickly swallowed up by the frantic action and really doesn't provide much of an impact as an actor.  Anyone could have played his part and with the very same results.  Pitt's character is a standard hero doing the standard things that heroes do in action flicks.  There were absolutely no surprises in that regard.

This is where the insensitivity comes. Outside the wall that Israel has put up to keep the Palestinians out is an enormous swarm of zombies that looks like an ant-colony trying to scale the wall. So, are these zombies supposed to be Palestinians? Very insensitive (see the movieOmar (Subtitled)for a more intelligent critique of the shameful wall.)  What's more Pitt really doesn't do much in Israel, except fly in a Belarus commercial airplane. As if it wasn't enough failing to prevent the neurologist from putting a hole in his head, Pitt blows up a hole in the plane turning the jet's engine into a meat grinder and his luscious blond hair tosses and swerves in its full glory amidst decompression.

1489004,A26SV90ILK5BNO,B005LAIIMG,Ethan,"[2, 6]","In his novel, World War Z, author Max Brooks, created a telling of a zombie infested, post-apocalyptic world. Rather than a traditional narrative, Brooks told his tale as a collection of individual recollections of the ten-year war against zombies. When the film adaptation of the bestselling book was announced, I was excited to see the book brought to life, but wondered if such an adaptation was even possible. How could the filmmakers adapt a book with so many characters and such a large scope.The answer . . . they don't. Rather than attempt to chorale Brooks's writing into the constraints of a film, the filmmakers use little more than the title and the idea of a zombie apocalypse in this ""adaptation"". With Brad Pitt playing a former UN employee who is called to jump back into his old lifestyle for the sake of his family, the filmmakers wisely choose to focus on a central character and his struggle to survive. I guess when you have Brad Pitt starring in your movie, you better use him!The film opens as Pitt, accompanied by his wife(Mireille Enos), prepares to drive his daughters to school. On this drive, the family witnesses the zombie outbreak firsthand, narrowly escaping the danger of the streets. Desperate to safeguard his family from the attacks, he calls upon his old friend at the United Nations, and agrees to help search for the origin of the outbreak in exchange for his family's asylum. They are then flown to an ocean based command center, where Pitt learns of the apparent virus that causes people to turn to zombies. As the film progresses, we follow Pitt as he visits numerous places around the world, each affected by the outbreak.World War Z is directed by Marc Forester (Finding Neverland, Quantum of Solace), who brings a fast pace and edgy tone to the story. It is very difficult to make a zombie seem threatening. Indeed, there were moments in this film where the zombies are almost laughable. But the filmmakers, deftly find a way around that. By allowing the actors to play their characters straight and develop genuine emotional stakes, the threat of zombies becomes more urgent and threatening.Before its release, World War Z was mired in production setbacks that included a massive rewrite and reshoot of it's third act.

Hughes ""jeop86""","[2, 4]","There is virtually no plot in this kinetic exercise, which finds Brad Pitt running from zombies world-wide as he investigates the outbreak of what appears to be a virus that causes people to become the undead. A former lead investigator for the U.N. (there's a confidence builder), Pitt is blackmailed into his globetrotting sleuthing by the U.S. Navy, which more or less tells him his family will be turned over to the zombies if he does not cooperate. Who or what Pitt actually is is never really made clear (he is not a doctor, so why is he the man for the job?), which makes the actions of everyone else in the movie so puzzling. People who've just met him sacrifice their lives to save him or give up their seats on aircraft, because he is from the U.N., just like the real world (not). Somehow everyone instantly knows that this is the-one-man-who-can-save-us, yet his own actions undercut this vision. I mean, if you are escaping riots and civil unrest in Philadelphia, would a sane person make their destination Newark, NJ? Physics don't seem to matter. A giant cargo plane is instantly refueled from a single fuel truck and able to fly from Korea to Israel, despite having landed ""on fumes"". A battered airliner leaves Israel in a hurry and manages to make it to Wales before anyone realizes there are zombies on board. Pitt and his Israeli companion both instantly recover from massive wounds that would fell a rhinoceros, and are the sole survivors of a catastrophic plane crash.The zombie attacks are pretty routine, except for the long shots, but these are so cartoonish as to be laughable. The film is one long chase scene until the end, when everything slows down and it sort of just stutters to a halt. The outbreak? Never solved. The war? Nope, left the door wide open for a possible sequel.

I like so many others who have read the book let that get in the way before even viewing it. Yes I know, that is not the way to go about things, but come on. There were so many problems with the filming of this movie so I thought I would wait. So when I eventually gave in and went to see this I was pleasantly surprised.Gerry Lane [Pitt] is a U.N. investigator who ends up having a pretty bad time. It turns out that he is right in the middle of a worldwide zombie outbreak. It also turns out that he is the guy that has to help find a way to stop this outbreak. In exchange his family will be kept safe but it is a race against time, so in order to save his family he has to save the world. It is just another day in the life of Brad Pitt err I mean Gerry Lane.I will go ahead admit that I was wrong about this film, sure it is not really like the book and left out some of my absolute favorite things but that is ok. I hear that a second one is being made now so hopefully some of the setting that were not used will find their way into that one. I did enjoy what this movie did use and even how something&#8217;s were changed. Now of course I am sure most people would say that Israel was probably the best scene from the film. I can see how some would think that but I really loved the when they were attacked trying to get back to the plane on his first trip. Not the plane in Israel but when he was with the soldiers in South Korea. That entire time there is easily the creepiest portion of the film, so it is easily my favorite.Now I have not really been a huge fan of the running zombies, sometimes it is great like the first &#8220;Return of the Living Dead&#8221; but other times I am just not into it as much. Here I get that they were going for the chaotic experience so it makes sense to do that but I feel like it could have been more suspenseful with the slow plodding ones. Still it did make for some entertaining moments and over all I think it worked. Director Marc Forster did a good job with this film as did the writers as they created the highest grossing zombie film ever if I am not mistaken.Now on to Brad Pitt who in all honesty did a good job here as well, in fact he did a great job. With that said even with a great performance nothing about his character stands out. I have read other reviews that have said the same thing so I know I am not alone but I think that is what makes it work. An actor like Pit usually steals the show with that not happening here you are more into the story. I don&#8217;t know it could just be me but I think it works. Everyone else is just as god as Pitt but the story is the real standout character here.You get some behind the scenes stuff as bonus features but I would have loved a commentary to hear all about the troubles of the shoot or even the &#8220;Battle of Moscow&#8221; stuff that was left out. Still this ended up being a very entertaining film. The unrated cut adds extra scenes and little more gore but not enough to make it any less watchable for the younger viewers.",4,GOOD ZOMBIE FILM,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2014,3144,"['WORLD', 'WAR', 'ZI', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'seeing', 'flick', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'announced', 'like', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'even', 'viewing', 'Yes', 'know', 'not', 'way', 'go', 'things', 'come', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'filming', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'wait', 'when', 'eventually', 'gave', 'went', 'see', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.Gerry', 'Lane', '[', 'Pitt', ']', 'U.N.', 'investigator', 'who', 'up', 'having', 'pretty', 'bad', 'time', 'out', 'right', 'middle', 'worldwide', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'also', 'out', 'guy', 'help', 'find', 'way', 'stop', 'outbreak', 'exchange', 'family', 'will', 'be', 'kept', 'safe', 'race', 'time', 'so', 'order', 'save', 'family', 'save', 'world', 'just', 'day', 'life', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'err', 'mean', 'Gerry', 'Lane.I', 'will', 'go', 'ahead', 'admit', 'was', 'wrong', 'film', 'sure', 'not', 'really', 'book', 'left', 'out', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'things', 'ok', 'hear', 'second', 'one', 'being', 'made', 'now', 'so', 'hopefully', 'setting', 'were', 'not', 'used', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'one', 'did', 'enjoy', 'what', 'movie', 'did', 'use', 'even', 'how', 'something', '8217', 'were', 'changed', 'Now', 'course', 'am', 'sure', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'say', 'Israel', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'think', 'really', 'loved', 'when', 'were', 'attacked', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'plane', 'first', 'trip', 'Not', 'plane', 'Israel', 'when', 'was', 'soldiers', 'South', 'Korea', 'entire', 'time', 'easily', 'creepiest', 'portion', 'film', 'easily', 'favorite.Now', 'have', 'not', 'really', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'running', 'zombies', 'sometimes', 'great', 'first', '8220', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', '8221', 'other', 'times', 'am', 'just', 'not', 'much', 'Here', 'get', 'were', 'going', 'chaotic', 'experience', 'sense', 'do', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'slow', 'plodding', 'ones', 'Still', 'did', 'make', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'think', 'worked', 'Director', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'did', 'writers', 'created', 'highest', 'grossing', 'zombie', 'film', 'ever', 'am', 'not', 'mistaken.Now', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', 'honesty', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'said', 'even', 'great', 'performance', 'nothing', 'character', 'out', 'have', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'said', 'same', 'thing', 'know', 'am', 'not', 'alone', 'think', 'what', 'work', 'actor', 'Pit', 'usually', 'show', 'not', 'happening', 'here', 'are', 'more', 'story', 'don', '8217', 'know', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'think', 'Everyone', 'else', 'just', 'as', 'god', 'Pitt', 'story', 'real', 'standout', 'character', 'here.You', 'get', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'bonus', 'features', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'commentary', 'hear', 'troubles', 'shoot', 'even', '8220', 'Battle', 'Moscow', '8221', 'stuff', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'Still', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'unrated', 'cut', 'extra', 'scenes', 'little', 'more', 'gore', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'less', 'watchable', 'younger', 'viewers']",World War Z
1489019,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B005LAIIMG,FNDNreview,"[4, 7]","Clearly, the zombie pandemic is alive and well in the world of entertainment.  These creatures aren't just a new sensation, they've be relevant in film for quite some time now and depending on whom you ask, zombies originated in film at least as far back as the 1930s.  Regardless, zombie films have come a long way and evolved into a genre all its own, typically bordering on horror - but without a main protagonist to specifically lead the mayhem (unless you'd like to make a claim for George A. Romero).  With the recent success of the highly popular AMC drama, The Walking Dead, and the Resident Evil franchise, not to mention comedies like Warm Bodies and Zombieland - it would appear the undead are preparing to continue their reign of terror for quite some time.  And, you know zombies flicks are at the height of their popularity when Brad Pitt decides to sign on for a leading role.Based on the novel of the same name by Max Brooks and directed by Marc Foster (Monster's Ball, Quantum of Solace), World War Z stars Brad Pitt as Gerry Lane, a former United Nations investigator called back to action to investigate the origin of a ""zombie"" academic.  Originally reluctant to take the assignment, Gerry decides it's in the best interest to (reluctantly) leave his family and attempt to find a cure.  However, finding an origin or a cure becomes difficult when every major city in the world becomes devastated by zombie outbreaks - leaving Gerry with little options other than to keep moving from city to city.  Mireille Enos, Ludi Boeken, James Badge, and Fana Mokoena also star in supporting roles.The film wastes little time, quickly turning to chaos on the streets of Philadelphia.  To be honest, the first half hour of the film feels like early episodes of The Walking Dead as we follow Gerry Lane, his wife, and their children, as they run from zombies on the street, through a building, and eventually face-off with them on a rooftop.  Essentially, that is what goes down in the first few episodes of The Walking Dead.  But, this isn't a Walking Dead comparison, and the fact that World War Z resembles a massively popular TV show is definitely not a bad way to start a film.  Zombie films should start off small, in a secluded area and then balloon from there - as the film does.World War Z might just be the grandest (in terms of visual scale) zombie film ever made, with all major cities falling to an unknown disease that kills people and quickly reanimates them in death as flesh eaters.  Most zombie films don't take the time to provide a grand scale look at major cities, often simply focusing on one specific city and a small group of people trying to survive within it or at least escape from it.  This film takes Brad Pitt's character from one end of the earth to the other, beginning in Philadelphia and moving to South Korea, Jerusalem, and finally a health lab in Wales.  There's no shortage of travel, nor are there many scenes without a zombie trolling around.You may have noticed from the synopsis or various advertisements that there is zero star power other than Brad Pitt.  This is - from beginning to end - a film dominated by Brad Pitt.  As he moves from one location to the other over the course of the film, he usually loses his supporting cast along the way (which shouldn't be too surprising).  Pitt portrays an observant character focused on the goal of finding answers, basically because he is blackmailed into it as a means to protect his family.  However, it is rather far-fetched to see the lengths army officers and other nations go to in order to protect him.  Evidently, Pitt's character really does mean a great deal to the survival of the human race - but that portion of the film is hardly understandable.  Far too many people lose their lives at the expense of allowing Pitt to move from one part of the globe to the other.  And, his character always manages to squeak his way out of danger.If you didn't follow the film's production news (and most people don't), World War Z had quite a bit of footage needed after the completion of filming to fully explain the ending.  Even though the ending is relatively simple and climatically uneventful, it would have been much, much worse without the added footage (basically the final 45 minutes) to fully explain the film's ending.  Sadly (mainly due to the lack of bloodshed), the film simply goes through motions of coming to its simple conclusion.  There are virtually no scenes where you're on the edge of your seat and frankly, the film's final stanza lacks the appropriate amount of drama for a zombie flick.  For once, people actually act sensible when dealing with a group of zombies - which is admirable, yet still pretty boring.As far as zombie movies go, World War Z isn't the best and it isn't the worst.  Still, the positives greatly outweigh the negatives.  The film is so full of action that it almost doesn't feel like a full-blown zombie flick.  It's not you traditional film about people hiding out and spending a film looking for salvation.  This film is about one man's goal to protect his family by investigating a global crisis - which just happens to be zombies.  Overall, Brad Pitt does an admiral job fighting off the well-designed villains - all while indicating he might even be back for some sequels sooner than later.The bottom line:  if you're a Brad Pitt lover, this might be an iffy choice.  It will depend on your devotion to him and whether or not you can handle a borderline horror flick.  However, if you're a lover of The Walking Dead or simply enjoy action-packed zombie movies (minus things constantly popping out at you in typical horror movie fashion) - this film is for you.  You certainly won't walk out of this film disappointed.  In fact, you'll walk out looking forward to a promising sequel.Grade:  C+FNDNreview.com",3,Brad Pitt (really?) takes on zombies in 'World War Z',1371772800,"06 21, 2013",2013,5856,"['Clearly',

Cohen,"[1, 1]","I really did not expect much of this film last summer, not being much of a Brad Pitt fan or of director Marc Foster, the man who directed one of my 5 least-favorite Bond films: Quantum of Solace.  Furthermore, like many, I had heard the stories of a confused script and a new ending forced to be filmed.  However, upon seeing the film, I found it to be a gripping and intense experience.  I watched the blu-ray unrated version yesterday and my opinion hasn't changed.This is an epic film of a world catastrophe going from Philadelphia, (actually Scotland) to North Korea to Israel (actually Malta) and a tense conclusion in Wales.  Like so many of the films of today, this film would not have been possible without CGI, particularly the scene of thousands of zombies climbing over each other to get over an enormous wall protecting Jerusalem. (Probably the type of wall we could use along our porous southern border.)Unlike The Walking Dead, where the world suffers a similar disaster, these zombies do not shamble along, they run and run fast.  And they bite, thats the way the zombie virus is spread. Pitt is surprisingly good (and he should be since he is one of the film's producers.)  I also like Mirielle Enos as his wife.  I've enjoyed her on the AMC series The Killing, and since she is always so grim and depressed on that series, it is nice to see her play a normal role and actually smile here (although, to be frank, the events of this film do not really give one much to smile about.)As stated, this is an unrated cut.  There were some scenes that did not seem too familiar to me although I have to admit that I don't remember what they were.  The picture and sound on the blu-ray were fine.  The special features consisted of several relatively short documentaries on the making of the film. (This is not a Peter Jackson film with 10 hours of special features.)  The &#34;making of&#34; documentaries were fine and just about everyone was interviewed with the exception of Pitt.  (I guess he was too busy.)In conclusion, this is a very exciting, fairly violent and bloody epic  that keeps the suspense and your interest up throughout.  As stated, I did not expect all that much of it, but it turned out to be one of my favorite films of last summer (right behind Star Trek and Man of Steel.)

This movie is going to give &#34;preppers&#34; another reason to stockpile canned soup and bottled water.No spoilers here....I'm an armchair movie director/critic  just like a lot of other people out there.  Movies are not just entertainment to me.  They are a source of inspiration for my own original writing in the horror genre.  I like the quality of a good storyline over the shock value of blood-n-guts anyday.  This movie delivers just that.I think the success of this movie is due to Brad Pitt.  Don't get me wrong....I'm neither a fan or critic of him, but let's face it----he's an extremely popular actor.  With that comes a big budget for the movie, and it shows every step of the way.  There's not a lot of other noticable faces in the film; no A list co-stars opposite of Brad Pitt.  The film literally latches onto his shoulders and he carries it every step of the way.  This is not a bad thing, mind you, in my opinion.  Actually, I feel he has been much more dynamic in other character portrayals, but he delivers nonetheless in this movie.  That being said, the supporting cast is spectacular.I'm one to believe it all starts with the director.  Also delivering in this film with equal credentials is director Marc Foster (Monster's Ball, Finding Neverland, Quantum of Solace, Kite Runner).  There's a great story being told here through his vision.  The movie may be about another zombie apocalypse, but make no misunderstanding: this is a fantastic dramatic approach that really brings a fresh new idea to an otherwise been there-done that movie monster.The film has a great look; the cinematography captures a feel and vibe that is most convincing.  It really sells the idea, or at least to me it does.  High action scenes are brought to you from a human element perspective and not just a bunch of big gratuitous bangs.  There's a couple of spots where the film made me question the reality delivery, but nothing that brought the experience to a halt.I want to be more specific about the film, but it would certainly spoil your viewing.  If you like zombie movies, this is one to keep in your collection right next the classic Romero film, Night Of The Living Dead.  They're nothing alike except for the common thread of zombies.

True or not, you can see the problems in this movie pretty easily -- plot issues that just make no sense more than anything else.His wife impulse calls him while he juuust happens to be in the middle of trying to be QUIET while getting back to his plane in Korea which results in many good guys dying-- Brad knows the Zombies are attracted by noise but he takes his sweet time telling the Israelis about it! OK maybe he was jet lagged. Too many such contrived/silly moments. I am not a watcher of Zombie stuff so the implausibilty of fast moving Z's didn;t bother me at all. In fact I thought it was about time someone came up with some speedier undead. It made theattacks visceral & pretty damn horrific. Bad stuff tends to happen quickly even if the buildup to it is slow. I actually felt that the movie itself took off too fast.........one family scene then BAM Philly goes to heck in a hand basket in 5 minutes. Have your popcorn ready before you click Play. Yeah maybe Brad turns out to be the luckiest guy on Earth -- pretty much everyone dies around him--but his acting isn;t overly macho & he IS used to being in touch'n Go situations so I didn;t have a hard time believing that he could be so cool under pressure. And I thought the story-line of him & the Israeli woman soldier was done very nicely. It's tough to be noticed as a supporting actor in a movie like this but I thought the soldier in Korea, the UN contact, the UN plane's pilot, the WHO Lab workers & many others all did fine jobs. Even with all of its flaws this movie was worth the $3.99 rental fee & we watched it 3 times in 48 hours & each time it got a bit better & a bit clearer. The Zombbie pile up at the wall was both silly and impressive. But the best scene is at the end when things slow down enough to allow for human interaction & a slower build-up to tension. The sad creepy jaw-snapping Zombies make the human moments even more gripping. The ending was kinda obviously ""tacked on"" but by that point you really do not need or want any more ""action""! You want to be talked down by Brad & allowed to settle a bit. So really I'd rate this 3.5 stars with the warning that I am not a Zombie connoiser, did not read the book & didn;t set the bar too high to begin with & thus wasn't overly disappointed with this movie.",3,trouble a'brewin,1381104000,"10 7, 2013",2013,2639,"['Apparently', 'good', 'thing', 'didn', 'read', 'book', 'seeing', 'movie', 'many', 'people', 'felt', 'cheated', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'had', 'heard', 'rumors', 'was', 'trouble', 'final', 'product', 'Mr', 'Pitt', 'was', 'not', 'pleased', 'way', 'things', 'turned', 'out', 'had', 'gone', 'make', 'changes', 'True', 'not', 'can', 'see', 'problems', 'movie', 'pretty', 'easily', 'plot', 'issues', 'just', 'make', 'sense', 'more', 'anything', 'else.His', 'wife', 'impulse', 'be', 'middle', 'trying', 'be', 'QUIET', 'getting', 'back', 'plane', 'Korea', 'results', 'many', 'good', 'guys', 'dying', 'Brad', 'Zombies', 'are', 'attracted', 'noise', 'sweet', 'time', 'telling', 'Israelis', 'OK', 'maybe', 'was', 'jet', 'lagged', 'Too', 'many', 'such', 'contrived/silly', 'moments', 'am', 'not', 'watcher', 'Zombie', 'stuff', 'implausibilty', 'fast', 'moving', 'Z', 'didn', 'fact', 'thought', 'was', 'time', 'someone', 'came', 'up', 'speedier', 'undead', 'made', 'theattacks', 'visceral', 'pretty', 'damn', 'horrific', 'Bad', 'stuff', 'happen', 'quickly', 'even', 'buildup', 'slow', 'actually', 'felt', 'movie', 'took', 'off', 'too', 'fast', 'one', 'family', 'scene', 'then', 'BAM', 'Philly', 'heck', 'hand', 'basket', '5', 'minutes', 'Have', 'popcorn', 'ready', 'click', 'Play', 'Yeah', 'maybe', 'Brad', 'out', 'be', 'luckiest', 'guy', 'Earth', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'acting', 'isn', 'overly', 'macho', 'used', 'being', 'touch', 'n', 'Go', 'situations', 'so', 'didn', 't', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'cool', 'pressure', 'thought', 'story-line', 'Israeli', 'woman', 'soldier', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'nicely', 'tough', 'be', 'noticed', 'supporting', 'actor', 'movie', 'thought', 'soldier', 'Korea', 'UN', 'contact', 'UN', 'plane', 'pilot', 'WHO', 'Lab', 'workers', 'many', 'others', 'did', 'fine', 'jobs', 'Even', 'flaws', 'movie', 'was', '3.99', 'rental', 'fee', 'watched', '3', 'times', '48', 'hours', 'time', 'got', 'bit', 'better', 'bit', 'clearer', 'Zombbie', 'pile', 'up', 'wall', 'was', 'silly', 'impressive', 'best', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'things', 'slow', 'down', 'enough', 'allow', 'human', 'interaction', 'slower', 'build-up', 'tension', 'sad', 'creepy', 'jaw-snapping', 'Zombies', 'make', 'human', 'moments', 'even', 'more', 'gripping', 'ending', 'was', 'kinda', 'obviously', 'tacked', 'point', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'want', 'more', 'action', 'want', 'be', 'talked', 'down', 'Brad', 'allowed', 'settle', 'bit', 'So', 'really', ""'d"", 'rate', '3.5', 'stars', 'warning', 'am', 'not', 'Zombie', 'connoiser', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'didn', 'set', 'bar', 'too', 'high', 'begin', 'thus', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'disappointed', 'movie']",World War Z

I am really shocked that so many people liked this movie - especially all those saying this was ""fun.""  There was nothing ""fun"" about this.

And I know he worked for the UN, but again, no idea why they needed him in particular.The story in general was pretty ridiculous.  I mean, I'm sure you have to suspend disbelief in general to believe in zombies at all, but nothing here was believable or logical.  The worst part was that Jerry sees two - literally TWO - people who the zombies don't attack and then figures out how to save the day.  And when he tests out his theory - OMFG.  I'd love to spoil the ending for you, but I won't.  But it's just absolute utter nonsense.  He does something absurd and 2 minutes later...boom.  Day saved.

So when six months back they started showin world war z trailers at the movies, they had my attention.I decided I will give the book a flirt but as often happens before I could get around to reading it, the film was playing and after such a bam bam trailer I decided to just go watch it. My friend accompanied me because she had heard it has shots of Glasgow, a place she used to live. She hates zombie genre otherwise. She had never seen the trailer. So the film ended and I said hmmmm.. Why did they have such an underwhelming use of 3d glasses? If you want to do 3d, do it like life of pi and great gatsby or else don't do it.Not bad. But come on its 2013, this film cost so much and this is all the director really made? This one will not make it to anyone's top 5 films of the year list, I pray it is not this underwhelming a year.Brad Pitt is alright. We have come to understand he is doing safe roles and wearing his personality down. It is almost as if the actor expects you to know him from before the start of the film. A great actor is supposed to create an impression of new ness with every single film. I like Pitt but the problem with him is he is too jaded and formulaic at times. That said, I liked him in last years killing them softly but anyway world war z should have been more than just what it's sum really was.Irrespective of what I would have heard I would have wanted to watch it. I hear there will be a sequel, we will see if it is more intense.Some film makers forget that the person watching the film may be confused because they have not read the book.

My one main problem with this film is they took out the huge zombie outbreak in Russia!! As soon as Pitt boards a Belarus airplane infected with heart-stopping zombies that plane should have landed in Russia, instead it lands in Wales and was obvious major changes happened to the film! WWZ needed an epic running time of 150 minutes instead of 115 minutes. That Russian set-piece should have stayed in the movie instead of the cutting room floor!! I hope dearly with the blu-ray release we get an extended cut or at the very least the massive deleted scenes are on the disk.The scope of this film is very big and I could have done with another 40 minutes in the cinema watching this movie.

Initially handed a $125 million budget but then escalating to $200 million, primarily because of seven weeks' worth of reshoots, this was one blockbuster them critics were tapping as the potential summer skunker. Detractors will surely rally around the ""This movie veers away from the book"" flag, and it's a valid gripe. This isn't an adaptation of Max Brooks' source material but more a hijacking of the guy's book title. The book takes place a decade after the zombie war and compiles a series of personal accounts as told by the survivors. It offers gripping insights regarding the abrupt crumbling of society, how the apocalypse impacted on a religious and geo-political scale. Brad Pitt presents us with a horror thriller that suffers some from schizophrenia. It promises to be this sweeping zombie saga but then backpedals into a third act that focuses on personal conflict. The film has flaws, absolutely. Still, I walked out of the theater with a paranoid grin on my mug, edginess in my bones. I think this movie's gonna make money, bad buzz and all.Brad Pitt has had a fantastic film career for someone so homely. Here, he takes a page from Will Smith in I AM LEGEND. He plays Gerry Lane, a resourceful former investigator for the U.N. called back into the field to locate the source of the global zombie pandemic. Gerry isn't a gung-ho sort anymore. He'd rather stay and protect his family, but he's presented with an ultimatum: either get with the program or his wife and two young girls get kicked out of the safety of the command ship, the U.S.S. Argus. So off he goes to South Korea, escorting a wet-behind-the-ears genius virologist and hoping to track down Patient Zero.My pals railed like fishwives that there weren't enough gore and blood and viscera, and they're not wrong. Way I see it, the budget had risen to such exorbitant heights that the suits freaked that the film wouldn't be able to recoup the cost. And so the hard R rating had to go because more people would attend a PG-13 picture. I'm a little surprised I wasn't as upset as my friends, but I was enthralled with the film's effective approach to classic Hitchcockian suspense. Your imagination does a lot of heavy lifting here. The first 20 minutes are as urgent and nerve-jangling an opening sequence as the one in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. I like that there isn't a set-up. There's a brief interlude in which the Lanes go thru their breakfast ritual. But then you're dropped in the thick of things and swept along by the escalated level of panic taking place onscreen. Philadelphia and Jersey become these terrifying, claustrophobic urban landscapes as the Lanes frantically wend their way thru the surging undead and the frenzied human mobs. In the dark, in my seat, I couldn't help thinking, ""If one person in this theater turns right now, we're all so screwed.""It's probably a mutant super-power to be able to distance a film from its source material, to view it as its own animal. I think I have it. Or maybe I got caught up with the massive fun of watching this in a packed house, a victim of a more genial sort of mob mentality. These fast-moving zombies scared the crap out of me, and I'm sure part of that is how someone bitten can turn in twelve seconds flat. It's up to you to buy into the CG stuff. Some of the scenes are over-the-top, like how the zombies in 1srael swarm and pile like Internet trolls. The personal drama loses oomph as Gerry Lane's wife (Mireille Enos) spends huge chunks of the film with a death grip on that satellite phone, waiting for our main man to call. We maybe would've been more invested had Lane's family been placed even more under duress. It sucks that Mireille Enos isn't given better and more things to do, because I think she's good here.The third act was supposed to have featured an epic invasion of Moscow, except that that was scrapped but for a few fleeting shots. Instead the third act culminates Gerry Lane's globetrotting quest in Wales, in a W.H.O. lab complex breached by zombies. This sequence features a downshift for how zombies are portrayed. The laboratory ghouls are near dormant, one scientist's exposition informing us that, unless activated by visual or auditory stimulus, they just aimlessly mill around like broke window shoppers at the mall. What unfolds in this sequence is tense stuff, but it also resurrects the more familiar zombie tropes. There may be some nervous laughter.WORLD WAR Z, more than any other zombie film, captures the global scope of the zombie apocalypse. I loved the speed and urgency of the narrative, and how it realizes and sustains the harrowing feel of end-of-the-world jeopardy. No, it's no in-depth meditation on society's collapse. But it's a hell of a wild rollercoaster ride done on a breathtaking scale. And, as a throwaway comment, I loved the concept of the Tenth Man.A few tips on surviving a zombie apocalypse (SPOILER alert):- When driving away from a pack of zombies, don't turn around for an extended period to impress the importance of the seatbelt rule on your kids- When navigating a gauntlet of noise-sensitive zombies, do turn off your phone- Don't ever leave your bloody crowbar behind- When trapped on a plane with an oncoming rush of zombies, stacking up luggage in the aisle sucks as a deterrent",4,"""Mother Nature is a serial killer.""",1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,5397,"['angst',

Either you liked it or you didn't.  If it's first rate drama you're after, watch an Ibsen or Chekhov play.  If it's sentimental fluff, go get ""When Harry Met Sally.""  If it's thrills and chills, sit down with ""The Praying Mantis"" or ""Tarantula"" or ""The Blob"" or any other horrific-monster-gobbling-up-everyone-it-comes-near movie.  If it's comedy, how about ""Red Dwarf?""  But if you want something that dispenses a little of each - ah!  that's where the ubiquitous Zombie Movie comes in.  It has it all - even if a given feature was not deliberately built into the script.Yes, ""World War Z"" has drama: it's about survivors trying to save themselves from a flood of zombies.  Yes, it has sentimentality galore: it's about a man trying to save his family. Yes, it has thrills and chills: the least sound can summon an attack from raging maniacs.  And yes, it even has comedy: the absurdity of going on a Quest to find from among billions of zombies ""Patient Zero.""Plus, it has some features unique to itself.  First and foremost, there's virtually no gore (and I well know how that alone sends many a Zombie movie reviewer over the edge).  In ""World War Z"" the zombies aren't trying to eat you, only to bite you and thereby infect you.  Second, and every bit as unique (by the way, here comes a SPOILER), is the way the danger is resolved, if only temporarily: not by trying to undo whatever precipitated the zombie onslaught but by rendering those uninfected ""invisible"" to the zombies.  That happens to be an ingenious plot resolution - as well as a natural segue to a sequel.Though not the screenplay itself, the ""screenstory"" (not sure how that differs from ""screenplay) was co-written by J. Michael Straczynski - you know: the creator and principal writer of the ""Babylon 5"" series.  And Straczynski's no upstart just out of Creative Writing 101.  The only other thing about the screenplay/story vis-a-vis the original book worth noting is that it's like having to listen to fingernails scratching a blackboard to have to keep reading again and again that ""the movie was nothing like the book"" or ""the movie was nowhere as good as the book.""  It's like this: a movie is completely different from a book - that's why they call it a movie and not a book with moving pictures!  Of course AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" seems to have gotten around that by referring to its comic book source as ""Graphic Novels.""And speaking of ""The Walking Dead,"" I saw a far greater similarity between that TV show and ""World War Z"" than between the movie and any other zombie rendering.  In fact, this provided my most squeamish moment watching the movie - because I kept thinking ""Someone's going to get sued!""Now to the acting.  Let me state outright that Brad Pitt has never been one of my favorite actors.  The only movie I've ever seen him in that I didn't hate was ""Thelma and Louise""; but that movie was one of the greatest ever made with or without Mr Pitt's performance.  Nonetheless, I found his acting in ""World War Z"" to be extremely good - ""good"" in this context meaning ideal for the role.  The only flaw was more in the character than in Brad Pitt's performance.  And that flaw was that no matter what happened he never lost his cool.  He never got angry or raised his voice - even when he was telling the Mossad Agent that the chanting and yelling in Jerusalem's streets was what was drawing the horde of zombies.  I mean literally, he never raised his voice, so you could barely hear him issuing his warning amidst the din of noise surrounding him.I will only comment on the other actors by saying I found their acting to be more than adequate - except that, like Brad Pitt, they almost never lost their cool.  Even when being attacked by the zombies.  Now that takes ""Grace Under Pressure"" to a whole new level.UPDATE:  Though I won't change my rating from 5-Star, after seeing tons of 5-Star reviews that are so obviously plants I feel embarrassed to have enjoyed this movie enough to give it 5 Stars.

What I mean is, you see a grouping of navy ships in the ocean--no zombies anywhere and all is settled.  I wouldn't have minded seeing the ships going through a sort-out--assume the virus is airborne, so some of the crews would be affected.

And the opening scene didn't lead me astray: Brad Pitt is with his family in the warm kitchen setting, basically cooking and saying &#34;I love you&#34; to his kids while his kids were smiling and saying &#34;I love you too Brad&#34;, then Brad and his wife hugged while the kids were smiling. At this point I was on the edge of my seat watching some quality family bonding. But things just got worse.Later Brad and his family were in a car further bonding and saying &#34;I love you&#34; back and forth, and I was loving every second of it. Seeing a happy white American family is why I pay $12 to see it on the big screen, but then the movie took a sharp derail. Suddenly ZOMBIES of all things started appearing and the city turned to pandemonium. WHAT THE HELL!? It doesn't get any better dear readers, yes while Brad is still with his white family they aren't warm and happy and saying &#34;I love you&#34; to each other, instead they're all panicked and trying to survive! BOOORING! Luckily the film had the good sense to keep cutting back to Brad Pitt's reactions while the world is going to hell, because we all know the source material showing the desolation of the world and collapse of civilization needs a white vaguely Christ-like figure to react to it.Later Brad Pitt and warm loving American family are on a boat with other refugees, and a big meanie comes out and says that Brad needs to do his part and look into the cause of the outbreak. WTF! Doesn't Sargent Jerkface realize that raising a family is doing your duty (amiright single mom's?)! So unfortunately Brad had to leave his family behind on the boat, but don't worry! Because he has a cell phone and every 10 minutes he calls his family and delivers such lines such as &#34;how are the kids&#34; and &#34;I'll come back to you&#34;. Finally! Something that's actually engaging, I don't care about the world, even other families that are getting violently killed! I just care about Brad Pitt's family, because they say &#34;I love you&#34; a bunch of times. THAT'S what this movie should've really focused on. Every time some zombie crap was going on I was pounding my arm chair and loudly demanding to know what Brad Pitt's wife and kids are up to!Thank White Jesus for the MPAA and concerned mothers across the country for guiding a movie called WORLD WAR Z about THE END OF THE WORLD into something I can take my screaming spawns to as well, because someone needs to think of the children!

1489154,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B005LAIIMG,Jack E. Levic,"[6, 8]","WORLD WAR Z certainly got a lot of unjustified bad press before its release. Over budget and full of delays, it seemed like a pet project of a major star who had gone overboard. I hesitated to see the film and now can happily say the critics were wrong.The zombies are at it again and this time they are in every corner of the world. No place is safe, especially large cities. These zombies are new and improved. They are almost super zombies who can jump and soar through the sky yet as with all zombies, there are a few constants. A shot to the head is the only sure way to kill a zombie. If a zombie bites you, you become one of them within seconds. Zombies meander without any purpose other than to create more zombies. Got that? Then follow along.WORLD WAR Z has a brief set-up. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) has left his job at the United Nations and is a stay-at-home dad for his two adorable daughters and loving wife. It's a tranquil and happy, if uneventful, existence. I was never clear as to what his exact job was at the U.N. and why he left. It seems like he was some sort of investigator in dangerous war zones. It only takes a few minutes for the action to begin and things get intense and terrifying. WORLD WAR Z has begun without any sort of advance warning.Lane is called back to work for the U.N. to uncover the origin of the zombie plague, but first he and his family have to be rescued from the zombies and taken to aircraft carriers far offshore. The action is intense for a while and it does raise questions of what will governments do when the zombies attack. How will the uninfected be rescued and where will they go? The decision is made to send Lane to find Patient Zero and where the pathogen originated. The journey starts in South Korea and Lane is always one step ahead of hoards of attacking zombies.There are plenty of special effects and action in WORLD WAR Z but it almost seems less about the zombies than about inter-personal relationships and how one lives through a zombie attack. The zombie pathogen spreads quickly across through the globe thanks to air travel..though if a person bit by a zombie becomes a zombie in seconds, we see how soon everyone in a plane becomes infected so who ends up flying and landing the plane? We can overlook some flaws in the script and just enjoy a good zombie movie.Brad Pitt has certainly grown up through the years and no longer is just another pretty face. In fact, Pitt looks aged and weathered in WORLD WAR Z. Are those wrinkles around his eyes created through make-up or is Pitt going natural? Pitt does a fine job as he tries to find the weak link in the zombie chain. Is there a vaccine that can save mankind or can the zombies be stopped. Rest assured that our hero won't give up.Lane travels to Israel where the government has been able to keep the zombies out. Jersusalem is even taking refugees  until the zombies seem to work in unision to form human pyramids to scale walls. Thousands of zombies are on the attack in Jerusalem and it is pure chaos. Young Israeli solder Segen (played by a remarkable Daniella Kertesz) bravely fights the zombies until she is bit by one and Lane quickly acts to save her in a serious OUCH! moment.While watching the zombies in action in Jerusalem, Lane realizes the zombies avoid certain people. Those ""healthy"" individuals aren't attacked, and lane thinks he knows why, but he has to find a research facility to test his theory. Of course, that involves leaving Jerusalem and getting to another country by plane, but we know what can happen on a plane is just one crankly zombie stows away. All this adventure does make the movie fun and engaging.Although WORLD WAR Z follows the zombie routine seen in countless films and TV shows, it does breath a bit of fresh air into the genre. Fans of zombie films won't be disappointed and anyone who likes a sci-fi/action film will find lots to enjoy in WORLD WAR Z. Although it is far from perfect, WORLD WAR Z tries and succeeds in giving the viewer a lavish and thrilling zombie-fest.",4,NEW IMPROVED ZOMBIES ATTACK THE WORLD,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,4044,"['WORLD', 'WAR', 'Z', 'certainly', 'got', 'lot', 'unjustified', 'bad', 'press', 'release', 'budget', 'full', 'delays', 'seemed', 'pet', 'project', 'major', 'star', 'who', 'had', 'gone', 'overboard', 'hesitated', 'see', 'film', 'now', 'can', 'happily', 'say', 'critics', 'were', 'wrong.The', 'zombies', 'are', 'again', 'time', 'are', 'corner', 'world', 'place', 'safe', 'especially', 'large', 'cities', 'zombies', 'are', 'new', 'improved', 'are', 'almost', 'super', 'zombies', 'who', 'can', 'jump', 'soar', 'sky', 'yet', 'zombies', 'are', 'few', 'constants', 'shot', 'head', 'only', 'sure', 'way', 'kill', 'zombie', 'zombie', 'become', 'one', 'seconds', 'Zombies', 'meander', 'purpose', 'other', 'create', 'more', 'zombies', 'Got', 'Then', 'follow', 'along.WORLD', 'WAR', 'Z', 'brief', 'set-up', 'Gerry', 'Lane', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'left', 'job', 'United', 'Nations', 'stay-at-home', 'dad', 'two', 'adorable', 'daughters', 'loving', 'wife', 'tranquil', 'happy', 'uneventful', 'existence', 'was', 'never', 'clear', 'what', 'exact', 'job', 'was', 'U.N.', 'why', 'left', 'was', 'sort', 'investigator', 'dangerous', 'war', 'zones', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'action', 'begin', 'things', 'get', 'intense', 'terrifying', 'WORLD', 'WAR', 'Z', 'begun', 'sort', 'advance', 'warning.Lane', 'called', 'back', 'work', 'U.N.', 'uncover', 'origin', 'zombie', 'plague', 'first', 'family', 'have', 'be', 'rescued', 'zombies', 'taken', 'aircraft', 'carriers', 'far', 'offshore', 'action', 'intense', 'while', 'raise', 'questions', 'what', 'will', 'governments', 'do', 'when', 'zombies', 'attack', 'How', 'will', 'uninfected', 'be', 'rescued', 'where', 'will', 'go', 'decision', 'made', 'send', 'Lane', 'find', 'Patient', 'Zero', 'where', 'pathogen', 'originated', 'journey', 'South', 'Korea', 'Lane', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'hoards', 'attacking', 'are', 'plenty', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'WORLD', 'WAR', 'Z', 'almost', 'less', 'zombies', 'inter-personal', 'relationships', 'how', 'one', 'zombie', 'attack', 'zombie', 'pathogen', 'spreads', 'quickly', 'globe', 'thanks', 'air', 'person', 'bit', 'zombie', 'zombie', 'seconds', 'see', 'how', 'soon', 'everyone', 'plane', 'becomes', 'infected', 'so', 'who', 'up', 'flying', 'landing', 'plane', 'can', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'script', 'just', 'enjoy', 'good', 'zombie', 'movie.Brad', 'Pitt', 'certainly', 'grown', 'up', 'years', 'longer', 'just', 'pretty', 'face', 'fact', 'Pitt', 'aged', 'weathered', 'WORLD', 'WAR', 'Z', 'Are', 'wrinkles', 'eyes', 'created', 'make-up', 'Pitt', 'going', 'natural', 'Pitt', 'fine', 'job', 'find', 'weak', 'link', 'zombie', 'chain', 'there', 'vaccine', 'can', 'save', 'mankind', 'can', 'zombies', 'be', 'stopped', 'Rest', 'assured', 'hero', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up.Lane', 'travels', 'Israel', 'where', 'government', 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'zombies', 'out', 'Jersusalem', 'even', 'taking', 'refugees', 'zombies', 'seem', 'work', 'unision', 'form', 'human', 'pyramids', 'scale', 'walls', 'Thousands', 'zombies', 'are', 'attack', 'Jerusalem', 'pure', 'chaos', 'Young', 'Israeli', 'solder', 'Segen', 'played', 'remarkable', 'Daniella', 'Kertesz', 'bravely', 'zombies', 'bit', 'one', 'Lane', 'quickly', 'save', 'serious', 'OUCH', 'moment.While', 'watching', 'zombies', 'action', 'Jerusalem', 'Lane', 'zombies', 'avoid', 'certain', 'people', 'healthy', 'individuals', 'are', ""n't"", 'attacked', 'lane', 'thinks', 'why', 'find', 'research', 'facility', 'test', 'theory', 'course', 'leaving', 'Jerusalem', 'getting', 'country', 'plane', 'know', 'what', 'can', 'happen', 'plane', 'just', 'one', 'crankly', 'zombie', 'away', 'adventure', 'make', 'movie', 'fun', 'engaging.Although', 'WORLD', 'WAR', 'Z', 'zombie', 'routine', 'seen', 'countless', 'films', 'TV', 'shows', 'breath', 'bit', 'fresh', 'air', 'genre', 'Fans', 'zombie', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'anyone', 'who', 'sci-fi/action', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'lots', 'enjoy', 'WORLD', 'WAR', 'Z', 'far', 'perfect', 'WORLD', 'WAR', 'Z', 'tries', 'giving', 'viewer', 'lavish', 'thrilling', 'zombie-fest']",World War Z

1489163,A1V3TRGWOMA8LC,B005LAIIMG,"James Beswick ""Thanks for your time""","[0, 1]","Given the number of good zombie films and TV shows around, together with the pedigree of the source material that World War Z is based upon, I was expecting something really great. Sadly, this is a lazy, messy, cobbled together effort that at best might keep you entertained on a plane for two hours. It's really frustrating since there could have been a classic film in here and instead all the rewrites and budget overruns shine through.Basically, World War Z is one is the least engaging big blockbuster flicks in a while and ditches absolutely everything that made the book so hard to put down. The film is in such a hurry to get into the action that we hardly learn anything about the hero (apart from 'all he does is make pancakes' according to his daughter) and it rapidly dives into an absurd survivalist flick that's a generic rehash of everything we've seen before. It's a story that suffers from having too few significant characters (staggering, given the breadth of the book) and hopes that Pitt can carry the weight of the film all by himself.The plot lurches from one insanely bad situation to another with increasingly ludicrous coincidences that save Brad Pitt and leave every else as zombie fodder. In between surviving car and planes crashes, we're taken on a global tour connected by the flimsiest of evidence (""there was an memo with the word 'zombie'!"" - seriously). Nothing Brad says makes much sense either - he advises that keeping moving is the most important strategy in a disaster, yet everyone he makes move then dies. There are completely out of place characters such as the armed druggie in the pharmacy who helps with meds and the indistinguishable WHO doctors listed in the credits WHO Doctor 1, 2, 3, etc. And while most action films escalate the tension, WWZ does the opposite with a banale finale that might have passed in one of the first episodes of a TV show but not a major film.WWZ is yet another big budget cinematic disappointment this year - I'd recommend checking out the book instead.",2,Disappointing for fans of the book,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",2013,2030,"['Given', 'number', 'good', 'zombie', 'films', 'TV', 'shows', 'together', 'pedigree', 'source', 'material', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'based', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'really', 'great', 'Sadly', 'lazy', 'messy', 'cobbled', 'together', 'effort', 'best', 'might', 'keep', 'entertained', 'plane', 'two', 'hours', 'really', 'frustrating', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'film', 'here', 'instead', 'rewrites', 'budget', 'overruns', 'shine', 'through.Basically', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'one', 'least', 'engaging', 'big', 'blockbuster', 'flicks', 'while', 'ditches', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'made', 'book', 'so', 'hard', 'put', 'down', 'film', 'such', 'hurry', 'get', 'action', 'hardly', 'learn', 'anything', 'hero', 'apart', 'make', 'pancakes', 'according', 'daughter', 'rapidly', 'absurd', 'survivalist', 'flick', 'generic', 'rehash', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'story', 'having', 'too', 'few', 'significant', 'characters', 'staggering', 'given', 'breadth', 'book', 'Pitt', 'can', 'carry', 'weight', 'film', 'himself.The', 'plot', 'lurches', 'one', 'insanely', 'bad', 'situation', 'increasingly', 'ludicrous', 'coincidences', 'save', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'leave', 'else', 'zombie', 'fodder', 'surviving', 'car', 'planes', 'crashes', ""'re"", 'taken', 'global', 'tour', 'connected', 'flimsiest', 'evidence', 'was', 'memo', 'word', 'seriously', 'Nothing', 'Brad', 'much', 'sense', 'keeping', 'moving', 'most', 'important', 'strategy', 'disaster', 'yet', 'everyone', 'move', 'then', 'are', 'completely', 'place', 'characters', 'such', 'armed', 'druggie', 'pharmacy', 'who', 'meds', 'indistinguishable', 'WHO', 'doctors', 'listed', 'credits', 'WHO', 'Doctor', '1', '2', '3', 'etc', 'most', 'action', 'films', 'escalate', 'tension', 'WWZ', 'opposite', 'banale', 'finale', 'might', 'have', 'passed', 'one', 'first', 'episodes', 'TV', 'show', 'not', 'major', 'film.WWZ', 'yet', 'big', 'budget', 'cinematic', 'disappointment', 'year', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'checking', 'book', 'instead']",World War Z

""28 Days Later"" & ""28 Weeks Later"" hinted at it, with great success! But here is a film that is so vast, so all encompassing, that it captured the essence of a world apocalyptic movie, besieged by zombies, in all it's awesome fearsome, dread, panic, & mayhem! Not to mention, plenty of suspense! No, this is not your average traditional zombie fodder, with zombies all over the place looking like they should be arrested for public intoxication. You wouldn't believe a bunch of drunks could take over the world, would you? No. Neither would I believe zombies that couldn't pass the straight line walking test, let alone take five minutes to finish it, could ever be a threat to the living, but these zombies, & this zombie film, are realistic! A different breed apart!When I say realistic. This is a Zombie film, so lets keep it in context. ""28 Days Later,"" ""28 Weeks Later,"" & the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" are the only films that I could swallow the human race falling extinct to. The new breed of the zombie genre film. Though these are not the first zombie films to use super fast zombies. On the opposite end, traditional Zombies. There is no traditional Zombie film in existence, that could make me believe that Zombies who move as slow & are as physically handicapped as a person who just drank a fifth in two hours of 80 proof whiskey, could take over the world. On the other hand, these ""World War Z"" zombies were very believable as antagonists challenging the world. They were fast, feral, & hungry! They had practically the whole world population infected in a very short time. The scenes of them climbing over each other, like ants crossing water over their own drowned, to attack the living, was just spellbinding! As was the scene with the nuclear bomb going off. Miraculously potent scenes that are a direct allegory to world terrorism, but this film had scenes of personal tragedy, sacrifice, & heroism too. The lab scene was a tense personal portrait of brave martyrs, as dozens of zombies are ready to scamper over each other like rats ready to chew on our protagonist's body parts with the slightest sound. While the rest of the lab scientists & technicians looked on through video cameras with horror & hope, that they make it back. The start of the movie, where the family is running & fighting for their lives. Heart pounding intensity of human survival at it most basic instinct, protect your loved ones & yourself!When I say realistic. I mean there was no dumb moves in this film by Pitt or any of the main characters. Not like the multitude of dumb moves in films like the original ""Dawn of The Dead."" Not even to mention the ridiculous, it's so bad, it's good, (no, I take that back, it was not good. It was really bad!) ""Day Of The Dead."" This is not a film where everyone knows they shouldn't stick their hand in a zombie's mouth, less be bitten, but do it anyway. It was not filled with idiotic, lets get killed to build a body count, horror clich&eacute;s.When I say realistic. I mean the way Pitt & scientist found to get around the zombies, & how they figured it out. I won't go into detail & spoil the movie.""World War Z"" in my opinion, is the best zombie movie ever made. Why? The acting, the direction, the editing, the plot, top flight! The combining of horror, action, & war movie genres, blending perfectly together, in an awe inspiring demonstration of movie magic! A film perfectly complimenting it's theme, the end of the world as we know it. Maybe most impressive is this. At the theater, not a single person hardly made a noise. They were totally absorbed in the spectacle of this film. No cheap jump tactics, to make them gasp, for this film needed none. No gallons of blood & buckets of gore, for this film needed none.

Kuntz ""wakingupin528""","[208, 270]","World War Z is Brad Pitt's zombie epic about the spread of a virus that turns people into the undead, but instead of walking they sprint and create chaos with every step. Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN investigator who is called into action by an old friend when the human race is on the brink of extinction. While he risks his life to look for a cure, his family (with his wife Karin played by the incredible Mireille Enos) is on a US Navy Carrier out at sea. Nations fall, people turn on each other, and it seems all is lost. But, this is not the case as Gerry begins piecing together clues and starts a search that will change everything, leading to the ""war.""WWZ is a truly impressive movie, especially considering it's a PG-13 zombie movie. While I do like the gore in a zombie film, this movie proved you don't need it. The zombies were frightening, the realistic science was there, warfare is taken into account, and overall it just felt like what would really happen if the zombie apocalypse happened. Marc Forster's directing was superb, showcasing both the epic scale of a global panic and war, while showing us the smaller battles and struggles that are happening everywhere else. This movie has the perfect transition, going from the massive blockbuster to a classic zombie movie setting. When it comes to acting, it was great. There were only two moments where the dialogue didn't quite match (when Gerry talks to Warmbrunn about the wall in Jerusalem), and even though there won't be any Awards the acting was still great. The visuals were happily polished, being more realistic, especially having both CG and practical zombies, with amazing make-up. You can see my review of the musical score on the soundtrack's page (by Marco Beltrami). But then there is the cinematography. Words cannot describe how impressive it was to see all the locations and sites, especially Jerusalem. Plus, this is only the start. WWZ kick-starts what should and can be a trilogy, just showing us the outbreak, spread and beginning struggles with the undead. There is so much more to come. World War Z is not for everyone, but anyone who appreciates well-made action movies, a thrilling epic, or some good freak-out moments, this is your treat.

I put &#34;zombie&#34; in quotes because the monsters in this film are not the walking dead in the traditional sense.  Instead they're virus carriers ala 28 Days Later who may not even be dead - just infected.  They also run really, really fast, which may or may not be your cup of tea.Max Brooks' novel, on which this film is very loosely based, was &#34;An Oral History of the Zombie War&#34;, and every chapter was a different perspective from around the globe, describing the outbreak, spread, and results of the &#34;plague&#34; on the survivors, as all great zombie stories do.  In this film, other than Pitt himself, there is precious little time devoted to any other living characters.  If this were to actually happen, how would the populace react?  Do the dead and to each other?  Romero is the master of this genre because he understands that the zombies are not the villains - they are simply part of the environment that the characters must contend with.  The real villains are ourselves - our selfishness and our greed.Finally, for a zombie film there is no gore at all.  I mean none.  I guess this is how you produce a PG-13 zombie picture, but for a longtime fan of the genre, this was particularly lacking.",1,The troubled production is evident onscreen.,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,1630,"['Less', 'driving', 'narrative', 'series', 'set', 'pieces', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'went', 'gauntlet', 'writers', 'directors', 'arrived', 'screens', '2013', 'fragmented', 'production', 'evident', 'onscreen', 'hero', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'up', 'one', 'location', 'various', 'reasons', 'order', 'find', 'solution', 'sudden', '34', 'zombie', '34', 'outbreak', 'spread', 'worldwide', 'seemingly', 'few', 'minutes', 'put', '34', 'zombie', '34', 'quotes', 'monsters', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'walking', 'dead', 'traditional', 'sense', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'virus', 'carriers', 'ala', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'dead', 'just', 'infected', 'also', 'run', 'really', 'really', 'fast', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'cup', 'tea.Max', 'Brooks', 'novel', 'film', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'was', '34', 'Oral', 'History', 'Zombie', 'War', '34', 'chapter', 'was', 'different', 'perspective', 'globe', 'describing', 'outbreak', 'spread', 'results', '34', 'plague', '34', 'survivors', 'great', 'zombie', 'stories', 'do', 'film', 'other', 'Pitt', 'precious', 'little', 'time', 'devoted', 'other', 'living', 'characters', 'were', 'actually', 'happen', 'how', 'would', 'populace', 'react', 'Do', 'dead', 'other', 'Romero', 'master', 'genre', 'zombies', 'are', 'not', 'villains', 'are', 'simply', 'part', 'environment', 'characters', 'must', 'contend', 'real', 'villains', 'are', 'selfishness', 'greed.Finally', 'zombie', 'film', 'gore', 'mean', 'none', 'guess', 'how', 'produce', 'PG-13', 'zombie', 'picture', 'longtime', 'fan', 'genre', 'was', 'particularly', 'lacking']",World War Z

But WWZ fans should feel fairly good about this film adaptation.

That makes them terrifying, as does their ability to scale obstacles by piling atop each other, antlike, until they reach their objective. The book's global reach, with reports coming in from various nations, is handled differently than the book, but manages to cover the US, the Koreas, Israel, India, Crete, Russia and Canada.Brad Pitt really steals the movie. He's a former UN investigator called in to deal with the madness. With his streaming long hair, he's a modern knight errant, living by his passion and wits, bravely going where no soldier or scientist dares. The film is non-stop action after about ten minutes of character development. There are crashes, explosions, screaming, terrified running and close escapes galore. The action drags a little in the last third (mostly due to a lack of zombies) when it swaps sheer terror for tension.

Dollars, per usual, made that dumbnon-artistic decision. Personally I wish PR departments weren't so damned lazy that they just threw money at aproblem and then sit back comfortably, after having made their overpaid decisions. But, it did put a lot ofdisappointed butts into theatre seats AND made a lot of stockholders very happy.Plot holes: They ONLY needed one infected person. Wrong.Firstly, zombies have taken over. As in, zombies are everywhere. A semi-working lab wasn't found until near theend of the movie and it wasn't functioning very well. Should a cure have been discovered at a local Kinkos thathadn't been overrun by zombies or maybe in a WalMart pharmacy department?I've read about the physics of zombie stacking here and it's wrong. Was it shown correctly in the movie? No; thebottom tiers should have been crushed under the weight, BUT, that wouldn't stop a horde of mindless zombies, onfull blown adrenal rush, from scaling a wall without any regard for their own individual well being, let alone thewell being of another zombie. Of course this is all based upon my assuming, that they wouldn't even realize thattheir are any other entities, other than their own selfish, self-centered, selves.You know, 'zombies be spoiled'.Why? You may ask? Because (1 zombies are mindless entities that do not care about harming themselves; (2 Army antscan do it to bridge areas, to get to where they want to go; (3 Zombies do not have to move like Frankenstein'smonster; (4 if zombies that don't just plod along some road in America, or are moving seemingly too fast, thenmaybe you were actually scared.

That's not to say it's a bad movie, on it's own. In fact, it's very good. They probably made a mistake in buying the rights to world war Z and marketed it as such. It has absolutely nothing to do with the book and now it's highly unlikely that we'll ever see a true adaption of World War Z the book, which is an utterly fantastic read.That said, it's an excellent movie and stands on it's own. It probably needed to be rated R. It needed a bit more in terms of disturbing images. Not gore, as that gets redundant quickly, but it needed more to grab the audience and make them feel like you felt when you first watched 28 Days Later. It should have been given it's own name: The Zombie War. WW3. Z. So many names would have worked. That's practically all they took from Max Brook's book.***************Major Spoilers from the book --- Do NOT read if you ever intend to read the book**************Those of us who read the book will always think of what it could have been. Brad Pitt is a first rate actor and the cast was excellent. If it had been even a little faithful to the book it could have been incredible. Brad Pitt could have played the interviewer travelling in the new redefined world. We could have had flash backs and the most important stories could have been presented. It would have been fantastic on so many levels.Eventually, a movie will be made that is faithful to the book, just the way the LOTR was eventually made.

1489280,A3F9VH8916IA40,B005LAIIMG,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[24, 38]","The summer of 2013 has not been a good one for movies. Again and again I've been treated to mediocre blockbusters from the dreadful Iron Man 3, to the disappointing Star Trek: Into Darkness, and ""meh"" Man of Steel. When the best movie I've seen all summer was the underrated sci fi Tom Cruise movie, Oblivion (which wasn't all that great either) you know it's a bad summer for movies. Nothing even came close to wowing me.World War Z on the other hand delivered exactly what I've always wanted from a zombie movie. Typically there are two types of zombie films. There's the Romero formula where a handful of survivors barricade themselves in a bunker of some kind (be it a house, a mall, an underground facility, etc) and attempt to wait out the storm, or the 28 Day Later/The Walking Dead story set a month or so after the war is already lost as the hero's fight to survive in the post-apocalyptic world. People like to complain that zombie movies have been played out but if you really think about it when it comes to bigger budgeted zombie movies almost every single one has followed one of these two formulas. As much as I love zombie movies, I've ALWAYS wanted to see a big, epic, war of the zombies. That NEVER happens.  I cannot think of one example of a decently budgeted zombie movie where we get to see the infection spread in real time and the world's government's attempts to fight it.As a fellow fan of the books, both World War Z and the equally fun Zombie Survival Guide, I understand the skepticism of many fans towards this movie.  No, it's not a faithful adaption. Yes, the only similarities are the title, the character names, and a few situations.  I get it. We fans are the hardest people in the world to please, and there's nothing we like less than an unfaithful adaption of a book we love. If that's going to be your hang up, I understand, and this is not the movie for you. However, if you are willing to overlook this fact, and watch this as its own standalone movie, then what awaits you is easily the best movie of the summer and one of the best zombie movies of all time. Besides Romero's original trilogy, no other zombie film I've seen can touch World War Z. It is the most epic, most intense, most nerve racking and scariest zombie film I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. No, it's not nearly as smart as the original Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead, and isn't quite as scary as Night of the Living Dead, but the shear scope of this film overshadows, at times,  even Romero's best efforts. I was legitimately scared by this film. That hasn't happened since I saw Night of the Living Dead for the first time. Zombies DON'T scare me. They just don't. But World War Z managed to do just that.The movie waste no time putting us right in the middle of the action. Apart from the opening or the PS3 game The Last of Us I don't think I've ever been as impressed with an opening to a movie like this. Twenty minutes into it Philadelphia is a blasted ruin, New Jersey is in chaos, the President is dead, and the military forced to fight the plague from the safety of their Atlantic fleet. From there on we get to witness Brad Pitt as he zips around the world from Pennsylvania, to South Korea, to Israel in an attempt to find the origins, and hopefully a cure, for the plague. Everywhere he goes the pace of the film is kept fast, tense, and in your face. Sure its gets kind of predictable as time goes by; Pitt goes to location A, zombies attack, he escapes, goes to location B, zombies attack, he escapes, etc, etc, etc. This would have really been better as a miniseries as it feels sort of episodic in nature and tries to cram a lot of locations and scenarios into its two hour run time, but frankly I felt they did this really well. Though the locations may change the tone and pacing are very consistent for the first three fourths of the movie, and Pitt being the great actor he is holds the film together even as his adventure spans the globe. It never felt choppy or disjointed, or like this was supposed to be a much longer story that was crammed into one shorter film. It all flowed surprisingly well and the fast pace kept my attention better than any action blockbuster this year. The formula is broken at the end when the film changes from non-stop action to slow, scary, suspense, but again though, I thought they did this remarkably well.I want to also give major kudos to those who made the decision to make the zombies the way they are. Besides Return of the Living Dead, this film has the most unstoppable zombies of any zombie film ever. Sometimes a bite takes ten seconds to turn someone, sometimes it takes a day. This allows for the outbreak to be extremely fast as we see in the opening but also allows for infected individuals to go undetected for long periods of time, only to turn when inside a safe zone. This, combined with the fact that only head shots bring them down and that they are able to climb over walls like a swarm of ants (not to mention they have magical jumping skills) makes these easily the scariest zombies ever put to film. Let's face it, making zombies a realistic threat to humanities survival isn't easy, but this movie makes the scenario frighteningly real. The speed with which the infection spreads and the ferocity of the zombies themselves makes for some very intense sequences.As for negatives, this movie does push the boundary on what we as an audience can be expected to believe. I can accept that zombies are impervious to pain, don't ever get tired, can climb on top of each other, etc. What I don't buy is when they fall off a huge freaking wall and don't break every bone in their bodies. It also gets really ridiculous the things Brad Pitt survives. He survives more potently fatal situations then Superman, and comes away with barely a scratch.  It's a little silly that way, but what action movie isn't?So if you are a fan of zombie movies, or just want a really fun action adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat for two hours, I can't recommend World War Z enough. If you've been dying to see an epic globe spanning zombie film like I have, there is no way you can miss this.",5,"In a summer of disappointment, World War Z delivers.",1372032000,"06 24,

1489286,ATQMXB565D9LR,B005LAIIMG,Jon Bastian,"[0, 0]","I'm normally not a fan of movies or shows about the Z-word, or even the whole concept. One of the only exceptions is ""Shaun of the Dead,"" but of course that's more of a comedy than a hungry, hungry corpses movie. So, I was pleasantly surprised by ""World War Z"" because, while it has the walking dead in it, it's more of a straight action/suspense/thriller flick but still remains focused on the humans in the story and makes us care about them.Like ""Shaun of the Dead,"" we are as in the dark as the main characters about what's going on at the beginning, so we are gradually immersed in this world with them. Even if we know the premise going in, the first part of the film (like ""Shaun of the Dead"") still manages to put us in the position of witnessing this catastrophe pretty much the way we would if it really happened. More importantly, it makes us really care about Brad Pitt's character and his family (both by blood and picked up along the way), so what happens matters.This is a lesson that all big-budget action films need to learn: give us specifically drawn characters, take the time to make us like them and care about them, then throw them out of the frying pan and we'll follow. Does ""World War Z"" move into conveniently bigger-than-life scenarios and escapes by our hero? Hell yeah. Do we just go with them by the time we get to them? Of course, because see above.The only complaint I have with the film is that it seems open-ended, but I know the reason for this. In adapting Max Brooks' novel, the filmmakers had to pick and choose and focus on one character, but I'm sure their original hopes were that other story-lines from the book could be made into subsequent films in the franchise. That still may happen. And if it does and those other films are like this one, then I will willingly go see the next installment in the theatre.PS: By the way, the film made me want to read the book, and that's also a rarity for me.",4,Thrilling Action Pic Breathes New Life into a Dead Genre,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,1940,"[""'m"", 'normally', 'not', 'fan', 'movies', 'Z-word', 'even', 'whole', 'concept', 'One', 'only', 'exceptions', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'course', 'more', 'comedy', 'hungry', 'hungry', 'corpses', 'movie', 'So', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'walking', 'dead', 'more', 'straight', 'action/suspense/thriller', 'flick', 'still', 'focused', 'humans', 'story', 'care', 'them.Like', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'are', 'dark', 'main', 'characters', 'what', 'going', 'beginning', 'are', 'gradually', 'immersed', 'world', 'Even', 'know', 'premise', 'going', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'still', 'put', 'position', 'witnessing', 'catastrophe', 'pretty', 'much', 'way', 'would', 'really', 'happened', 'More', 'importantly', 'really', 'care', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', 'family', 'blood', 'picked', 'up', 'way', 'so', 'what', 'matters.This', 'lesson', 'big-budget', 'action', 'films', 'need', 'learn', 'give', 'specifically', 'characters', 'take', 'time', 'make', 'care', 'then', 'throw', 'frying', 'pan', ""'ll"", 'follow', 'Does', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'move', 'conveniently', 'bigger-than-life', 'scenarios', 'escapes', 'hero', 'Hell', 'yeah', 'Do', 'just', 'go', 'time', 'get', 'course', 'see', 'above.The', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'film', 'open-ended', 'know', 'reason', 'adapting', 'Max', 'Brooks', 'novel', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'pick', 'choose', 'focus', 'one', 'character', ""'m"", 'sure', 'original', 'hopes', 'were', 'other', 'story-lines', 'book', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'subsequent', 'films', 'franchise', 'still', 'may', 'happen', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'one', 'then', 'will', 'willingly', 'go', 'see', 'next', 'installment', 'theatre.PS', 'way', 'film', 'made', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'also', 'rarity']",World War Z

1489292,A1VF0102Z9VITO,B005LAIIMG,Joseph M. Reninger,"[0, 0]","One of the many films I regret not having seen in the cinema last summer is World War Z, based on the popular novel by Max Brooks. We zombie parents love World War Z in its many forms and were excited about a movie version. Naturally, a movie must be very different from the book. The book is a series of interviews and stories collected while compiling a report for the United Nations. A narratively faithful version would have to be a TV miniseries, probably mimicking the Ken Burns documentary style. A two-hour movie could not cover all the different stories in the book but the movie gets the feel of it by spanning the globe in search of a way to fight the unrelenting waves of the undead.&#34;Waves&#34; is a good term to use, because the zombies here for the most part are fast-moving swarms that overrun streets, walls, apartment buildings, etc. The visuals of zombies piling up in massive heaps to scale walls are amazing. There are very few close-ups of zombies till the end. They are not very gory even when attacking people. Almost all of the gore happens just off screen, making viewers squirm more than feel nauseated.The story follows Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) a retired special agent for the UN who gets pulled back into service as the world begins to be overrun. He and his family flee their Philadelphia home and are picked up in Newark, New Jersey, by the UN forces after some harrowing encounters. They are taken to a air craft carrier that's become the UN headquarters. Lane is convinced to help the investigation into where the infection came from and he heads off to North Korea. Things don't go well there and he starts hopping from place to place to try and find a solution to the zombie problem.The movie is exciting enough in parts but is not quite convincing. I never believed Brad Pitt's character was in jeopardy, which is a bit of a problem. None of the other characters are around long enough or developed enough to be compelling. After his family makes it to the boat, any jeopardy they experience feels forced.Considering the great source material, the film borrows unnecessarily from other sources. For example, the last third looks like something from the Resident Evil game franchise (I haven't seen the movies yet but have played one or two of the games); there's a Hannibal Lecter-type character; the ultimate solution is cribbed from Species and is not very believable.On one hand, I wanted to like this movie a lot. On the other, I didn't really hate it. It's just another summer action movie that takes itself too seriously and (rather shamefully) begs to become a franchise at the end.

World War Z IS one of those movies. And yes IT IS REALLY GOOD.World War Z stars Brad Pitt as Gerry and almost instantly we are introduced to he and his family; his wife Karin portrayed by Mireille Enos. The acting in this film was good; almost too good for a movie like this. The movie itself is nearly two hours but the pace of the film is fast. The story line carries the film to different parts of the world while it brings suspense, action, and obviously, a lot of zombies.I have seen many movies with good use CGI and bad use of CGI. In World War Z the CGI is not the best, but it is such a good movie that it is really nothing to complain about.I will say I like this movie a lot for what it is. It does not feel like a Michael Bay Transformers film that despite (great action sequences and visuals), has dumb cheesy moments or is a movie that is too long, and it definitely is not like any other recent movie with zombies, no World War Z is truly artful, and surprisingly intriguing. The action is great, the story is excellent, and great job from the multi-talented supporting cast. As suggested with the climatic sequence of the film, and the confirmation by the good people at Paramount Pictures, there will be a sequel (hopefully Sequels). I myself, along with many others I know in the world will be waiting and watching.

1489302,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B005LAIIMG,J. Richardson,"[1, 2]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Over the past couple of years the zombie apocalypse genre has really exploded in almost every form of media. While I'll admit that the genre never really resonated with me like it did with others, I still found myself drawn to World War Z. Not because it looked different from the other films, video games, and novels out there and not because I'm a huge fan of Brad Pitt. It just looked... more humane than everything else I've seen up to this point. However, when it was all said and done, I can't say I enjoyed it as much as I hoped.Based on the 2006 novel of the same name, World War Z follows former United Nations employee Gerry Lane (Pitt). After being attacked by a hoard of zombies while sitting in traffic with his wife and kids, Gerry and his family find themselves on the run until a helicopter comes to pick them up and bring them to a U.S. Navy vessel. After his friend Thierry (Fana Mokoena) explains the situation, Gerry is forced to travel half-way across the world in order to find a cure for the virus. If not, he and his family are kicked off the vessel and left to fend for themselves.One of World War Z's strongest attributes is its inherent ability to keep you on the edge of your seat, literally. I usually watch movies laying down, but within the first fifteen minutes I found myself propped up in a seated position and I didn't move for the remainder of the movie. From start to finish, World War Z is an intense experience unlike any other. Whether Gerry is on the run from a massive group of zombies or creeping quietly through a zombie-infested building, your heart is bound to be pumping out of your chest. What makes it even more exciting is the fact that there's very little down time so this intensity is almost non-stop.Also, the CGI for this film is breathtakingly beautiful. The animation for the zombies is flawless and, at times, pretty insane. When you see these large flocks of zombies sprinting around, toppling over each other, or piling to reach the top of a gigantic wall, it's almost surreal. While I don't agree with the media's decision to constantly make these creatures sprint at 20+ mph, I can appreciate the level of detail that went into making them come to life. There's no doubt in my mind that it took a lot of time and dedication to make them perfect and it shows in the end.Unfortunately, that's where most of my enjoyment stopped. I was pulled in because of these extreme situations, but the narrative surrounding these moments is nothing short of mediocre. I never felt attached to Gerry and I never cared about his well-being or that of his family. They were disposable bags of flesh in an unfortunate circumstance and I never felt like I ever gained an understanding of Gerry as a human being. The only character I truly held any attachment to was a young soldier by the name of Segen (Daniella Kertesz). She may have only had a few lines of dialogue, but she was the only one who actually felt like more than just a prop in the story.Another thing that genuinely bothered me was the lack of closure. The conclusion to the story is so open-ended that it left me begging the question, what was the point? We followed Gerry through attacks, chases, plane crashes, and the like, but for what? So he could find a ""camouflage""? That's it? Really? It made the entire journey essentially meaningless. I understand that not every story needs a happy or perfect ending, but at least arrive at a point. There needs to be some meaning behind everything that happened. Otherwise it winds up just being wasted time.With that said, though, Brad Pitt worked really well with the material he was given. His performance wasn't jaw dropping and it's not going to go down as one of the best performances of his career, but he did well. He was able to bring some life to an otherwise two-dimensional character and I commend him for that. I also have to give Kertesz her recognition as well. As I said earlier, she doesn't have much dialogue, but it's her mannerisms that really stand out and show her ability as an actress. I can't comment too much on anyone else because a great majority of the acting came from Pitt. Everyone else just had a few minutes here and there.Finally, the score, composed Marco Beltrami was solid. Some of the compositions were a little too generic for my taste, but they worked well within the film itself. They were loud and robust when they needed to be, but also quiet and eerie in just the right places. Beltrami definitely had a good understanding of what needed to be present here and he delivered with the perfect score. While it may not be one of the most impressive I've heard this year, it fits for the source material.Overall Score: 6.75/10 - While I did find myself intrigued during certain areas of World War Z, I can't say that I was overly impressed with the end result. It aims to be a serious entry into a genre that usually fails to be anything more than bizarre, but in its efforts it lost any sort of life that could have made it a fantastic film. I would only recommend this to the hardcore zombie enthusiasts. If you're a casual like me then I would say skip it or give it a rental.",3,6.75/10 - Underwhelming,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",2013,5223,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Over',

To me, this movie reminded me of a cross between Resident Evil and I Am Legend, incorporating elements of both.  I am not so familiar with the book that WWZ is based so I cannot judge how closely or how far it strays from the book but like most movies the moviemakers rarely stick closely to the original book it is based.After reading about the original filmed ending being based in Russia with a harsher and more bleak, I was curious if that ending would have worked better than the one on the big screen now.  Based on the description, I am not sure it would have been better but would have given some food for thought.WWZ differs from  Resident Evil's zombie kill them all style of storyline and a little less emotional storyline than I am Legend (I like I Am Legend a bit better).  I would say that it fits somewhere in between, which doesn't make it a bad thing as I liked the storyline even though it seemed the rewrite was set up strictly to create a sequel possibility if the movie did well, which looks like that will happen.Some people will not think this a good zombie movie due to the lack of zombie fighting going on but I thought the approach was good and entertaining, Instead the movie focuses on finding out what caused the zombie disease so a cure could be found.  I thought that idea brought something new in the zombie realm of movies.Even before I read about the rewrite, I did feel that some parts were cut and abrupt a little and could have been done a bit better.  I felt the movie was a bit disjointed as well at times and you can definitely tell that the movie is a product of multiple rewrites and 2 directors which hurts the film.I thought the lack of character development was also a weakness of the movie as there was little in that realm that kept me emotionally attached to the characters.  Something that I am Legend does much better.The Zombies themselves seemed realistic and scary and even up close such as the lab scene the makeup and acting of the zombies were well done.WWZ is not perfect but is definitely a good movie to watch that despite some flaws that I enjoyed watching.  It kept me entertained throughout even with its problems and although it strayed from the book, this movie is entertaining for what it is.",4,Decent Zombie thriller,1372896000,"07 4, 2013",2013,2640,"['World', 'War', 'Z', 'movie', 'United', 'Nations', 'employee', 'Gerry', 'Lane', 'Pitt', 'who', 'world', 'race', 'time', 'stop', 'Zombie', 'pandemic', 'toppling', 'armies', 'governments', 'threatening', 'destroy', 'humanity', 'itself.I', 'recently', 'watched', 'theater', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'even', 'had', 'major', 'rewrite', '6', 'month', 'delay', 'supposedly', 'strayed', 'book', 'movie', 'reminded', 'cross', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Am', 'Legend', 'incorporating', 'elements', 'am', 'not', 'so', 'familiar', 'book', 'WWZ', 'based', 'so', 'can', 'not', 'judge', 'how', 'closely', 'how', 'far', 'book', 'most', 'movies', 'moviemakers', 'rarely', 'stick', 'closely', 'original', 'book', 'based.After', 'reading', 'original', 'filmed', 'ending', 'being', 'based', 'Russia', 'harsher', 'more', 'bleak', 'was', 'curious', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'one', 'big', 'screen', 'now', 'Based', 'description', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'food', 'thought.WWZ', 'differs', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'zombie', 'kill', 'style', 'storyline', 'little', 'less', 'emotional', 'storyline', 'am', 'Legend', 'like', 'Am', 'Legend', 'bit', 'better', 'would', 'say', 'somewhere', ""n't"", 'make', 'bad', 'thing', 'liked', 'storyline', 'even', 'seemed', 'rewrite', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'strictly', 'create', 'sequel', 'possibility', 'movie', 'did', 'well', 'will', 'happen.Some', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'think', 'good', 'zombie', 'movie', 'due', 'lack', 'zombie', 'fighting', 'going', 'thought', 'approach', 'was', 'good', 'entertaining', 'Instead', 'movie', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'caused', 'zombie', 'disease', 'so', 'cure', 'could', 'be', 'found', 'thought', 'idea', 'brought', 'something', 'new', 'zombie', 'realm', 'movies.Even', 'read', 'rewrite', 'did', 'feel', 'parts', 'were', 'cut', 'abrupt', 'little', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'bit', 'better', 'felt', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'as', 'well', 'times', 'can', 'definitely', 'tell', 'movie', 'product', 'multiple', 'rewrites', '2', 'directors', 'film.I', 'thought', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'also', 'weakness', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'realm', 'kept', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'characters', 'Something', 'am', 'Legend', 'much', 'better.The', 'Zombies', 'seemed', 'realistic', 'scary', 'even', 'up', 'close', 'such', 'lab', 'scene', 'makeup', 'acting', 'zombies', 'were', 'well', 'done.WWZ', 'not', 'perfect', 'definitely', 'good', 'movie', 'watch', 'flaws', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'kept', 'entertained', 'even', 'problems', 'strayed', 'book', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'what']",World War Z

It's fast, swift and terrifying. In lieu of protection for his family, Gerry agrees to find the source, Patient Zero, at the risk of his own life. What he learns has less to do with Patient Zero and Ground Zero, where it all began--how it all began and who knew what about the zombie infestation first.I have not read the book and not having read it, the whole backstory is MIA and a few of the 'clues' to explain how Gerry came up with the idea of a pseudo-cure is vague though handled better than I thought. This could have been a muddling, confusing and very sub-standard zombie-apoc movie but the handling of the script and editing helps to give a more cohesive movie based on a book rather than a frustrating interpretation of the original concept.In terms of originality, all the credit goes to Max Brooks, for giving us an a-typical hero and a typical story-line that felt fresh. His treatment of the cause as much as the pseudo-cure is clever and different. There is hardly any gore but lots of scare moments that made me jump. The zombies in this movie isn't that far off the George A Romero version but enough differences make it feel fresh. The performance of the film itself, its characters, is a white-wash. This is no character study but all action. It's good action and done pretty darn well. Brad Pitt rarely emotes, and the only real surge of any emoting is a young Israeli solder.

1489337,A84SIUM0F6E8H,B005LAIIMG,"kei. ""g.k. bevido""","[0, 2]","FIrst of all, this was a good book - written by Max Brooks of The Walking Dead, but because the show has been on for 3 or 4 seasons now, I think this movie would have done much better had it been released before TWD TV series. If you aren't a TWD watcher or just read Patient Zero by Max Brooks, you may like this movie. I liked the book, looked forward to the film but have had too much ZOMBIE SURViVAL by now.  I think Brad Pitt played his role good, as he always does though.  There are suspenseful moments and revelations - but all these would have much more impact had they not  been unveiled in TWD, making much of what would have made us say  &#34;aHA&#34;, old news in this movie. It's too bad because I would have rather seen these all these theories and survival methods done the way Pitt came to his conclusions and tried out his theories, and came out victorious. The movie has a good ending that would have also had more of an impact had it been released before 4 seasons of TWD.  It's still a good movie, with good effects - I believe there is a disc included to see it in 3D but I don't own anything that allows me to see it this way.  If you've been following The Walking Dead you probably saw these types of effects already ... can't say one did any better than the other, although the TV series showed some things in a much more ..&#34;gory&#34; way. Although I enjoyed it and watched it a few times today - you may find it predictable - I suppose this would depend on if you read Brooks' book which this is based on (Patient Zero) or if you're an avid fan of TWD. Brad Pitt needs to get a new PR agent or something because lately I've been expecting much more from his movies and his starring in it is the only redeeming factor - they previews have been misleading (Tree of Life, Killing Them Softly) - but I still enjoy them all - probably because I watch them so many times to catch all kinds of cool things you miss if you view these films just once.I PRE-ORDERED THIS FROM AMAZON - GUARANTEED THE LOWEST PRICE- TO BE SENT TO ME WHEN MOVIE WAS RELEASED ON DVD. Well I just received it.  The stores' racks are ghost town shelves with nothing but the &#34;WWZ  Get it for only $14.99 NOW&#34; signs dangling off shelf as if the store was looted.  ALL OVER TOWN FOR $14.99 and I am charged 24.00 + - AMAZON SAID I WOULD GET THE LOWEST PRICE POSSIBLE  IF I PRE-ORDERED THIS WHEN IT JUST CAME OUT AT THE THEATER, pay no more than 24.00 and get it lower if the price outside of Amazon was less.I will never PRE-ORDER another movie from Amazon, the promises are getting worse and worse... with EVERYTHING lately.  False photos, lies like&#34; this lowest price&#34;, descriptions that are absolutely untrue.... AND THE WORST THING: AMAZON's CUSTOMER SERVIC time.  *** sorry, I know this last part has nothing to do with my review of the movie but I'm getting no where otherwise with the past 10 screw ups/lies and long, too long, holds for Customer Service who makes the call ten times longer than any other customer service.  FORTUNATELY WHILE TYPING THIS REVIEW, AMAZON COMPENSATED ME OVER THE PHONE - A mutual agreement with the least amount of trouble for us both, SO I DO NOT FEEL SO BAD; THIS Cust Rep took the initiative to THINK and we resolved this issue to my satisfaction, without my having to return my order- and it took a fair amount of time. PHEW!  Sorry about this last venting - it's a good movie that should have been released earlier, and as predictable as some of it is- I still enjoyed it. If you're unfamiliar with Brooks' Zombie Survival books and graphic novels, you willl probably like it. If you are not a TWD fan - you'll find this interesting.

This is how the story goes: On an ordinary day, Gerry Lane and his family find their quiet drive interrupted by urban gridlock. An ex-United Nations investigator, Lane senses that this is no ordinary traffic jam. As police helicopters buzz the sky and motorcycle cops careen wildly below, the city erupts into chaos. Something is causing hordes of people to viciously attack each other - a lethal virus that is spread through a single bite, turning healthy humans into something unrecognizable, unthinking and feral. Neighbor turns on neighbor; a helpful stranger suddenly becomes a dangerous enemy. The origins of the virus are unknown, and the number of infected grows exponentially larger each day, quickly becoming a global pandemic. As the infected overwhelm the world's armies and rapidly topple its governments, Lane is forced to return to his dangerous former life to insure the safety of his family, leading a desperate worldwide search for the source of the epidemic and a means to stop its relentless spread.The cast led by Brad Pitt (who also produced) (as Gerry Lane) is excellent. The directing by Marc Forster is excellent. The screen story (based on the novel by Max Brooks) by Matthew Michael Carnahan (also wrote the screenplay) & J. Michael Straczynski & the screenplay by Carnahan, Drew Goddard & Damon Lindelof is excellent.The music by Marco Beltrami is excellent. The cinematography by Ben Seresin is excellent. The film editing by Roger Barton & Matt Chesse is excellent. The casting by Kate Dowd is excellent. The production design by Nigel Phelps is excellent. The art direction by Jon Billington, Ben Collins, James Foster, Alan Gilmore & Matthew Gray is excellent. The set decoration by Jennifer Williams, set design by Claudio Campana, set dressings by Tammie Childress is excellent. The costume design by Mayes C. Rubeo is excellent.

The special effects are something we have never seen before. The pack behavior of these zombies was just real enough to captivate my interest. Watch a National Geographic show on army ants or schools of fish and you will see some real similarities. The highlight for me was the entire Jerusalem scene. The reasoning of the ""tenth man"" was fascinating, explaining why the nation of Israel was one of the few nations to be prepared (somewhat) for the apocalypse of the undead. It was here, in and around the ""city of peace"", that the ""swarming"" effects were at their best. The plane sequence was also very well shot- after the grenade, we get to see zombies sucked out into free falls, and the effects were superb. Brad Pitt is excellent. His character goes out in search of ""patient zero"", and a young epidemiologist instructs him that ""nature is a proficient serial killer""; furthermore, she leaves bread crumbs- clues, as to why she is doing it. There is some truth in his claim that her most frightening manifestations also serve to hide her weak point- a ""chink in the armor"". In real life, the Ebola virus is an example of this. We fear it because it kills- viscously... quickly... totally, with few survivors; however, this is also it's greatest weakness. For a virus to spread, to become a true pandemic, it needs to be more subtle, with a longer incubation period, and a greater chance of host survival. Ebola is too vicious- and burns itself out before disseminated contagion can occur. It's most fearful characteristics are also it's weak point. So then- how does this all relate to the final epiphany arrived at by our hero?. In other words- what does Brad Pitt's ""solution"" have to do with the original ""problem"" described by the virologist?  I haven't a clue! But hey... that's OK- I  went to watch a massive zombie apocalypse, and boy did WWZ deliver!!",5,Swarming Zombies make for great summer fun!,1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,1947,"['What', 'say', 'WWZ-', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'WWZ', 'simply', 'lot', 'fun', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'something', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'pack', 'behavior', 'zombies', 'was', 'just', 'real', 'enough', 'captivate', 'interest', 'Watch', 'National', 'Geographic', 'show', 'army', 'ants', 'schools', 'fish', 'will', 'see', 'real', 'similarities', 'highlight', 'was', 'entire', 'Jerusalem', 'scene', 'reasoning', 'tenth', 'man', 'was', 'fascinating', 'explaining', 'why', 'nation', 'Israel', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'nations', 'be', 'prepared', 'somewhat', 'apocalypse', 'undead', 'was', 'here', 'city', 'peace', 'swarming', 'effects', 'were', 'best', 'plane', 'sequence', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'shot-', 'grenade', 'get', 'see', 'zombies', 'sucked', 'out', 'free', 'falls', 'effects', 'were', 'superb', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'excellent', 'character', 'out', 'search', 'patient', 'zero', 'young', 'epidemiologist', 'nature', 'proficient', 'serial', 'killer', 'furthermore', 'bread', 'crumbs-', 'clues', 'why', 'doing', 'truth', 'claim', 'most', 'frightening', 'manifestations', 'also', 'serve', 'hide', 'weak', 'point-', 'chink', 'armor', 'real', 'life', 'Ebola', 'virus', 'example', 'fear', 'viscously', 'quickly', 'totally', 'few', 'survivors', 'however', 'also', 'greatest', 'weakness', 'virus', 'spread', 'become', 'true', 'pandemic', 'be', 'more', 'subtle', 'longer', 'incubation', 'period', 'greater', 'chance', 'host', 'survival', 'Ebola', 'too', 'vicious-', 'burns', 'out', 'before', 'disseminated', 'contagion', 'can', 'occur', 'most', 'fearful', 'characteristics', 'are', 'also', 'weak', 'point', 'So', 'then-', 'how', 'relate', 'final', 'epiphany', 'arrived', 'hero', 'other', 'words-', 'what', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'solution', 'have', 'do', 'original', 'problem', 'described', 'virologist', 'have', ""n't"", 'clue', 'hey', 'OK-', 'went', 'watch', 'massive', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'boy', 'did', 'WWZ', 'deliver']",World War Z

Brad Pitt's Production Company had a bidding war with Leonardo De Caprio's Production Company over Max Brook's book &#34;World War Z&#34;. Brad won and started trying to get it made as far back as 2005. Marc Forster wasn't their first choice as Director but he proves he can tighten the screws and never let up all the way through and the extra minutes that the unrated version adds just makes it more so. For those looking in this version for the original ending, it's not here. Word was the original 40 minute ending was re-filmed. I'm hoping in a few months, Paramount will say &#34;Hey, if we release this DVD/BluRay again and add the original ending along with the theatrical ending, we'll make a fortune again.As the time of this review, the film cost about $190 million dollars to make and had made almost a billion dollars worldwide. Pitt has plans for two more sequels and I hope they are as good as this one as Brad Pitt as a retired UN Negotiator is blackmailed into traveling the globe to find where the virus started, so his family can stay safely aboard the Navy vessel they were rescued to. The action is believable and the gore is minimal. Although the film is rated PG-13, I would think twice about letting any child see this film. They may have nightmares for weeks.

1489443,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B005LAIIMG,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[5, 10]","Paramount Pictures presents and Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace, Finding Neverland) directed ""World War Z"" with a lot of real compassion and interesting action that might make you jump once or twice. However, the story written from Max Brooks's novel and was developed into a screenplay by Mathew Michael Carnahan (Lions for Lambs, the Kingdom), Drew Goddard (Cabin In The Woods, Lost) and Damon Lindelof (Star Trek: Into Darkness, Prometheus) had very strong middle with interesting things being revealed slowly, but left too many questions as to what lead up to the this Zombie-making virus. Not to mention the end of the film which leaves you either to expect another sequel or you're asking yourself, ""...exactly what the He%$ happened? That's it?""Now for the good stuff, Brad Pitt (Fight Club, Inglorious Bastards) is back and he does a fairly decent job playing a father who is only really passionate about his two kids and his wife played by Mereilla Enos (The Killing, Gangster Squad). They both are extremely believable in their somewhat heroic efforts to avoid Zombies, climb buildings and avoid the deadly bite of a new virus. And there way of communicating to each other throughout the movie is extremely poignant to the film.That's the other thing about the sci-fi element in this movie, there is no real explanation of what, where or how this virus develops and it's ultimately still kind of vague on what cure is or reason is for it existing even after the film is over. Also the onset of the virus only takes 10 seconds after you are bitten and then poof, you're a Zombie! Even the most viral viruses we know of on Earth can take as much as 12 to 24 hours to incubate. All that aside, the movie has some great dramatic moments of tension and some surprises that will literally make you jump once or twice right out of your seat. Nothing like a dead person jumping at you (in 3D if you see it that way) trying everything they can to take a bite out of you.The CG Zombies are pretty good and the amount of action from dead people making a ""Zombie ladder"" over a wall to an actual airplane crash (complete with an onboard Zombie attack) is all fairly well done. Coupled with an eerie and suspense building score of Marco Beltrami (Live Free and Die Hard, I, Robot), the movie was also slightly humorous.How you may ask? There is a really good scene where Brad has to deal with a Zombie and basically figure out how to get around him to get to a medicine cabinate. In that time the Zombies make this wonderful creepy yet strangely funny clicking noise with their jaws and teeth. It always seemed to get a laugh out of the audience - until they attack you and then bite of course.David Morse (The Green Mile, Contact) plays a creepy ex-CIA agent who basically gives Brad Pitt the reason and motivation of finding out what the source of these Zombies are and where the original virus may have originally come from.It does have quite the international cast like Ludi Boeken (Q, Deadlines) as an Israel official who decided to build a wall around Jerusalem just for this apocalyptic event. (How did he know?)  Daniella Kertesz (Loving Anna, Sceenz) plays an Israeli soldier who loses more than her pride when she is almost killed by the Zobies themselves. And even Fana Mokoena (Safe House, Hotel Rowanda) plays a US official and the only governing congress member on the off-shore government naval vessel who actually help Brad and his family, does a great job of suppressing his fears.Overall, minus some of the story holes and go-nowhere ending, it was an interesting film dealing with some action, suspense and creative make-up effects headed by make-up supervisor Karen Cohan (Captain America, Les Miserables). Although, not to gory, it's probably not for the really young or weak of heart and if you're a Zombie fan, you're gonna love it!",3,"""Teeth Chattering Zombie, They Had Some Charm In ""World War Z""""",1375228800,"07 31, 2013",2013,3852,"['Paramount', 'Pictures', 'presents', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'Quantum', 'Solace', 'Finding', 'Neverland', 'directed', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'lot', 'real', 'compassion', 'interesting', 'action', 'might', 'make', 'jump', 'once', 'twice', 'However', 'story', 'written', 'Max', 'Brooks', 'novel', 'was', 'developed', 'screenplay', 'Mathew', 'Michael', 'Carnahan', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'Kingdom', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'Cabin', 'Woods', 'Lost', 'Damon', 'Lindelof', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'Prometheus', 'had', 'very', 'strong', 'middle', 'interesting', 'things', 'being', 'revealed', 'slowly', 'left', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'what', 'lead', 'up', 'Zombie-making', 'virus', 'Not', 'mention', 'end', 'film', 'expect', 'sequel', ""'re"", 'asking', 'exactly', 'what', '%', 'happened', 'Now', 'good', 'stuff', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Inglorious', 'Bastards', 'back', 'fairly', 'decent', 'job', 'playing', 'father', 'who', 'only', 'really', 'passionate', 'two', 'kids', 'wife', 'played', 'Mereilla', 'Enos', 'Killing', 'Gangster', 'Squad', 'are', 'extremely', 'believable', 'somewhat', 'efforts', 'avoid', 'Zombies', 'climb', 'buildings', 'avoid', 'deadly', 'bite', 'new', 'virus', 'way', 'communicating', 'other', 'movie', 'extremely', 'poignant', 'film.That', 'other', 'thing', 'sci-fi', 'element', 'movie', 'real', 'explanation', 'what', 'where', 'how', 'virus', 'ultimately', 'still', 'kind', 'vague', 'what', 'cure', 'reason', 'existing', 'even', 'film', 'Also', 'onset', 'virus', 'only', '10', 'seconds', 'are', 'bitten', 'then', 'poof', ""'re"", 'Zombie', 'Even', 'most', 'viral', 'viruses', 'know', 'Earth', 'can', 'take', 'as', 'much', '12', '24', 'hours', 'incubate', 'aside', 'movie', 'great', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'tension', 'surprises', 'will', 'literally', 'make', 'jump', 'once', 'twice', 'right', 'seat', 'Nothing', 'dead', 'person', 'jumping', '3D', 'see', 'way', 'trying', 'everything', 'can', 'take', 'bite', 'you.The', 'CG', 'Zombies', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'amount', 'action', 'dead', 'people', 'making', 'Zombie', 'ladder', 'wall', 'actual', 'airplane', 'crash', 'complete', 'onboard', 'Zombie', 'attack', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'Coupled', 'eerie', 'suspense', 'building', 'score', 'Marco', 'Beltrami', 'Live', 'Free', 'Die', 'Hard', 'Robot', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'slightly', 'humorous.How', 'may', 'ask', 'really', 'good', 'scene', 'where', 'Brad', 'deal', 'Zombie', 'basically', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'get', 'get', 'medicine', 'cabinate', 'time', 'Zombies', 'make', 'wonderful', 'creepy', 'yet', 'strangely', 'funny', 'clicking', 'noise', 'jaws', 'teeth', 'always', 'seemed', 'get', 'laugh', 'audience', 'attack', 'then', 'bite', 'course.David', 'Morse', 'Green', 'Mile', 'Contact', 'creepy', 'ex-CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'basically', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'reason', 'motivation', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'source', 'Zombies', 'are', 'where', 'original', 'virus', 'may', 'have', 'originally', 'come', 'from.It', 'have', 'quite', 'international', 'cast', 'Ludi', 'Boeken', 'Q', 'Deadlines', 'Israel', 'official', 'who', 'decided', 'build', 'wall', 'Jerusalem', 'just', 'apocalyptic', 'event', 'How', 'did', 'know', 'Daniella', 'Kertesz', 'Loving', 'Anna', 'Sceenz', 'Israeli', 'soldier', 'who', 'more', 'pride', 'when', 'almost', 'killed', 'Zobies', 'even', 'Fana', 'Mokoena', 'Safe', 'House', 'Hotel', 'Rowanda', 'US', 'official', 'only', 'governing', 'congress', 'member', 'off-shore', 'government', 'naval', 'vessel', 'who', 'actually', 'help', 'Brad', 'family', 'great', 'job', 'suppressing', 'fears.Overall', 'story', 'holes', 'go-nowhere', 'ending', 'was', 'interesting', 'film', 'dealing', 'action', 'suspense', 'creative', 'make-up', 'effects', 'headed', 'make-up', 'supervisor', 'Karen', 'Cohan', 'Captain', 'America', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'not', 'gory', 'probably', 'not', 'really', 'young', 'weak', 'heart', ""'re"", 'Zombie', 'fan', ""'re"", 'gon', 'love']",World War Z

The ""acting"" is pedestrian at best -- Pitt's two ""cute"" daughters are annoying enough that I actually found myself wishing they'd get eaten.  Every scene feels contrived and often like a cut-and-paste from another movie -- which I suspect most of them are.The zombies are those high-speed dudes from 28 Days Later (now THAT is a zombie movie), and they make a lot of noise and shriek -- but someone decided to trim (or not even shoot) any kind of carnage, so while there are some spectacular crowd scenes (you've seen most of them in the trailer BTW) there isn't any visceral threat, little tension, and no horror to speak of.The film makes the classic mistake that most Hollywood groupthink projects make: disrespecting the genre.  In ""Night of the Living Dead"" the dead rose and feasted on the living -- and no one wasted time trying to figure out why.  In ""28 Days Later"" a virus got loose, and the infected feasted on the flesh of the living -- and no one wondered why.  In Zac Snyder's silly remake of ""Dawn of The Dead"" one of the characters died, and then it was revealed that if you're not bitten you don't come back: so where did the first Zombie come from?  HINT: it didn't matter until the idiot screen-writer brought it up.WWZ has Brad Pitt on a quest for Patient Zero (a la ""Contagion"" -- a great apocalyptic movie BTW) so they can do what?  Find a cure?  You turn Zombie TEN SECONDS!  Find a vaccine?  They BITE you!  It's like creating a vaccine for shark-bite!By the time Pitt arrives at the final act you can anticipate the dialog word for word, and then it all turns into a Doom-like videogame.But wait, maybe I was just jaded, with ridiculous expectations?  I felt so bad about feeling bad about this movie that I rented ""Mama"" just to see if I was having a bad day: ""Mama"" scared the pants off me.WWZ?  Forget it!

Nothing spectacular, but still good stuff to keep you watching and on the edge-of-your-seat at times.

1489493,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B005LAIIMG,maskedgamer,"[0, 3]","The entire movie is mostly Brad Pitt running around trying to find a solution to the Zombie virus outbreak. The problem is that it's not executed very well. Each person he meets babbles about something random and then goes on to tell him that ""the princess is in another castle"". So finally he sets out to the next location to find the origin of the virus so he can stop it. Along the way in his search he realizes something about the attacking zombie herds that leads him to have a stroke of genius that will help him find a way to save humanity.This movie is mostly CGI zombies and the other usual Hollywood special effects. I don't know what it was exactly about this movie but nothing worked for me. Brad Pitt isn't exactly someone I think off when I think Zombie, and to make matters worse he looks completely out of place here. His cookie cutter family doesn't match him, his pretty boy persona in a world gone to the dogs doesn't match him, and his serious/stale acting style just doesn't fit the movie. This guys delivery could never make me think he's in any danger. No matter what situation you get, you always end up with the poker face Brad Pitt. Is he happy? Is he Scared? Is he angry? I don't know he uses the same expression and delivery for all those emotions. It's not Brad Pitt's fault this movie doesn't fit him though, this film is pretty predictable and bland to begin with. Aside from seeing Zombies pile up to form ladders that's about all that's new. The theory of stopping the zombies has been done before in other horror movies. This is the first time I think I've seen it done with Zombies though.The thing that doesn't make this film work though is that aside from the cheesy CGI zombies (which are so unbelievably obvious I thought I this was a PS3 game), the movie lacks the Zombie feel to it. It just feels like your typical action movie. It's more Action/Science Fiction than it is Horror. This is adapted from a book that I haven't read so I'm not sure the direction these zombies are supposed to go in. With Zombies it can be anything. They used to be Supernatural and the dead coming back to life, then people started to try to make it believable and added in the toxic chemical theories and then the virus theories which takes it from being supernatural horror to science fiction. This is kind of like ""I am Legend"" with the scientific approach to understanding and solving the issue.For me the movie fell apart when Brad Pit meets a certain group of folks that are nestled away working on a solution. They are all so clean cut,mentally together, and nonchalant about what's going on that it only reminds you how poorly executed this movie is in trying to make you feel like the Zombie outbreak has ended the world as we know it.The bottom line is that this movie is just a way to kill time. I actually paused it to run errands for a few hours then came back to it. It was that engaging! I'm not surprised though I rarely find myself enjoying Brad Pit movies. It's not that I dislike him or his acting, the roles he takes are never in movies that interests me.

The story follows a familiar pattern for this type of film, there's an outbreak that spreads rapidly and humanity is turned into zombies.What this film does better than most is drive home the possible worldwide scenario for this story. It showcases some incredible set pieces on a large scale for a zombie outbreak. In fact this is the film's strongest point, some of those scenes are simply fantastic to watch.The pacing of the film is pretty good, it gets going quickly and keeps the pace up throughout, although there's a minor stutter near the end. The story might not be anything that hasn't been seen before, but the telling of it is slick.Brad Pitt does a good job as the lead, it's far from his greatest role but he works well as the focus of the film. The book is more a collection of tales from around the world telling the history of the outbreak, the film follows a similar globe trotting pattern, but in a more singular fashion, just following the single lead character.Overall this is a fun zombie film, it's sense of scale and high production values sets it up a strong member of a crowded genre, but is well worth a watch.",4,Good sense of scale,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,1332,"['enjoyed', 'reading', 'book', 'based', 'while', 'back', 'was', 'excited', 'learn', 'movie', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'good', 'film', 'book', 'decent', 'zombie', 'film', 'story', 'familiar', 'pattern', 'type', 'film', 'outbreak', 'rapidly', 'humanity', 'turned', 'zombies.What', 'film', 'better', 'most', 'drive', 'home', 'possible', 'worldwide', 'scenario', 'story', 'incredible', 'set', 'pieces', 'large', 'scale', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'fact', 'film', 'strongest', 'point', 'scenes', 'are', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'watch.The', 'pacing', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'going', 'quickly', 'pace', 'up', 'minor', 'stutter', 'end', 'story', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'anything', ""n't"", 'been', 'seen', 'telling', 'slick.Brad', 'Pitt', 'good', 'job', 'lead', 'far', 'greatest', 'role', 'well', 'focus', 'film', 'book', 'more', 'collection', 'tales', 'world', 'telling', 'history', 'outbreak', 'film', 'similar', 'globe', 'trotting', 'pattern', 'more', 'singular', 'fashion', 'just', 'following', 'single', 'lead', 'character.Overall', 'fun', 'zombie', 'film', 'sense', 'scale', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'sets', 'up', 'strong', 'member', 'crowded', 'genre', 'well', 'worth', 'watch']",World War Z

I really didn't know what this was all about, I saw it was a prime movie, so I decided to watch it.Surprisingly, I was hooked. Again, I can't stress how much I really think the only movies are dumb. Vampires, zombies, you name it, I'm not a big fan. This movie however, focused more on the people of the movie, surviving, and what you would do for your family, also focused on the &#34;mission&#34;. In the big scheme of things, very little attention was paid to the zombies. Sure, there are scenes where you see the zombies &#34;walking like zombies&#34;, but only so you'd obviously know what's going on, and understand what &#34;your&#34; dealing with.  There was not a ton of special-effects.

The first 10-15 minutes, that is what happening, but they ended up putting his family off to the side, and focus mainly on him. Don't get  me wrong, it helped the movie along in some degree, but I feel like it lost some of the &#34;personal touch&#34; by doing that. On a different level, it was still about him saving, protecting his family, but, his family was nowhere to be seen.All in all, this is a really great movie. I would watch it again.

Amazingly, it's not a bad film, not bad at all. Casting Brad Pitt for the lead role is undoubtedly one reason the film works. The promo poster was what attracted me to it.  The older Brad has lost most of his &#34;cuteness&#34; appeal, but his expressive face and acting ability enable him to pull off a role that could have been very campy in the hands of a lesser star. (Tom Cruise probably could have made it work, but Pitt was the less obvious, and in my opinion, better choice.) I thought all of the characters were well-cast. No one looks like a fashion model. The acting  is very serious, there are no moments of comic relief, and the movie never descends into campiness, despite the ridiculous premise. The Zombies are decidedly silly, bug-eyed and snapping, but chilling nonetheless.  I was especially impressed by the zombie hordes, and there are plenty of zombie hordes. They have the horrific appeal of an ant swarm.I watched the slightly cut version available on Amazon, which is alledgedly a bit less bloody that the uncut film. That's fine with me; I have a low tolerance for pink jello, dripping wax, and fountains of  blood. In &#34;World War Z&#34; here is very little gore, but lots of action and suspense, and a great central character. If you can't resist the impulse to make a Zombie film, but want it to appeal to the largest audience, this is the way to do it. It wasn't perfect, but it was entertaining, and mild enough not to give the adult viewer a stomach ache and nightmares for the next month.

1489518,A3Q07NIIS6V2CT,B005LAIIMG,"Mia N. Searles ""The Muses Circle""","[21, 31]","Adapting books into movies is the new fad in Hollywood. With zombie mania taking over just about all aspects of multi-media, it's been getting increasingly more difficult to find a zombie tale that stands out. World War Z, based off of the popular novel of the same name by Max Brooks, is the first zombie movie in quite a few years that tries to take itself seriously. And for this reason I was intrigued. Okay, and maybe because Brad Pitt was starring in it. Zombies and eye candy, right? But anytime I hear about a movie being delayed for reshoots, I get nervous. Originally, World War Z had a December 2012 release date but due to extensive reshoots, it was decided to move the film to summer 2013. Before the movie hit theaters, I had planned on reading the book version, but once I learned that the movie was heavily deviating from the novel, I decided not to read it so I could go into the film with an open mind. I'm relieved I went with my instincts, because my 3 star rating probably would have been lower.Here's the thing. I liked the story and the general direction WWZ was going in. Gerry (Brad Pitt), a man who once had a dangerous job as a United Nations employee, gave it all up for his family. The movie doesn't get into much detail here, but you get the sense that Gerry was tired of spending long periods of time away from his wife and daughters. It's also not stated what he currently does for a living but I sort of assumed he was a stay-at-home father and appeared quite happy at making his girls breakfast and packing their lunches. I like that Pitt's character doesn't fall into one of the many stereotypical male characters, ya know, the one where the husband/father gives up his dangerous career to make his family happy but secretly yearns to get back into the field and jumps at the opportunity when it comes knocking at his door. Nope, I never got that feeling from Gerry; he appears content and happy with his role as doting husband and father. However, this all changes when zombies enter the picture. In order to protect his family, he is forced to go back out in the field to help find the origins of this devastating pandemic. Yes, I mean literally forced. While his old UN ties help get his wife and daughters to safety, his old boss has his own agenda. If Gerry wants his family to remain on the ship with protection and 3 square meals a day, then he must go. If he refuses, him and his family will be dropped back off into the ravaged, zombie-invested city they barely escaped. I definitely felt bad for him because seriously, what kind of choice is that?Let's back up for a moment. Gerry's previous job makes the beginning of WWZ somewhat believable as he navigates his family through the city of mass hysteria as people start changing into zombies within seconds. Although you don't quite know exactly what his previous set of skills were, you can tell by his calm, take- charge demeanor that he's had some kind of training. I actually liked his wife. Again going back to stereotypical characters, it was so refreshing to see that this wasn't the case with her. Instead of the typical, hysterical females we are used to seeing, Gerry's wife did everything he said, remained calm, no bitching or crying-- basically she appeared to have complete trust and faith in her husband and his abilities to keep them safe. Gerry's daughters on the other hand...I'll get to that later. I also liked the female soldier he meets up with later in the film. She was pretty hardcore, although she annoyed me towards the end when she...yeah, I'll get to that in a bit as well.The zombies themselves were pretty interesting, even though you don't get a real up close and personal look at them until the end. They also deviate from some of the characteristics we are used to-- these zombies are super fast, not slow. Also, they are not drawn to people by scent. What gets these walking dead fired up is sound.They kind of walk around in a dormant like state until they hear something. Cool, right? Yeah, well, it could have been cool if it wasn't for...I'll get to that in a moment. I promise.The last thing I liked about WWZ is the shift in priority ""the cure"" takes. There are so many zombie movies and books out there that focuses on finding the cure. But what if you find something that can camouflage you from the dead? I reviewed a zombie book earlier in the week called FIEND by Peter Stenson that focused more on the discovery of what they needed to do in order to NOT turn into a zombie rather than actually finding a cure. In WWZ, a kind of camouflage presents itself first, which takes precedence. I'm trying to be as vague as possible, but I guess what my point is, I like the twist and it is more realistic. After all, not all cures can be found in a week or a month. It may even take years.If you are still with me so far, thank you for being patient. Because I am sure at this point you are wondering what possibly could be so bad after talking so highly about the movie. Here is where it all went wrong.  Remember how I said World War Z is the first zombie movie in awhile that tries to take itself seriously? Well, one thing I CAN'T STAND is a movie that tries to take itself serious yet is filled with cliche after cliche. Like I said above, the movie starts off solid. Gerry and his family are stuck in city traffic when zombies start to make their debut. They steal an RV which is smart since it's (a) big enough to push other unmoving cars out of the way and (b) can possibly serve as a temporary home instead of being cramped in a car. I was slightly annoyed with Gerry's daughters; I guess since his wife didn't fit the typical stereotype, they figured to make his kids do all the whining and not listening. But whatever, small price to pay if the rest of the movie goes smoothly, right? Just when I am thinking this, one of his daughter's has an asthma attack. And it JUST so happens they forgot the inhaler at home. Why I didn't see it coming when they had talked about packing the inhaler before they left the house, is beyond me. But it should have been my first warning that more cliches were coming. The asthma attack forces them to stop at a grocery store that has a pharmacy inside. Okay, cool, they can grab the meds and some supplies. Once they go inside, it is complete chaos. People, including police officers, are running up and down the isles, ransacking the place. So what does Gerry and his wife decide to do? Yup, you guessed it. They SPLIT UP. WTF! Isn't like Survival 101, NEVER SPLIT UP??? Because you know what happens when they split up. Gerry's wife gets accosted, one of his daughters is screaming her head off. Oh, and let's not forget the RV is gone when they finally get back outside. Yup, cliche after cliche......And the cliches continue. Once they learn that sound is what attracts the zombies, you can guess what the rest of the movie is filled with. Yup, people making noises over and over and over again. Here are a just a few examples:1) Riding rusty, SQUEAKY bicycles in the RAIN in hopes to get to the plane faster. Really??? They were better off walking quietly and letting the hard rain cover their footsteps!2) The epic scene in the trailer where the zombies scale the walls in hordes. The only thing that saved that scene was how awesome it looked. But you know what caused it? A whole CITY of people singing and if I remember correctly, the sound was even louder because the singing was being projected through speakers.3) Towards the end, Gerry and a couple of others need to get into a certain part of a lab that is overrun by zombies. Gerry says no guns since it will attract sound. Do they listen? Nope. Soldier chick not only takes a gun with her, but uses it. You're smart enough to imagine the consequences of that.4) Gerry appears to forget his own advice to stay quiet as possible as he and his little group: (a) walk on broken glass, (b) ""accidentally"" kick something across the floor, (c) push a creaky door inch by inch instead of just opening it quickly.World War Z had a lot of potential. The focus of the story was engaging, the non-stereotypical characters were refreshing, and the zombies were interesting. But why ruin a perfectly good movie with cliche after cliche? I'm not stupid. I get movies like this need to build suspense and I can handle a scene here and there. But when characters keep making the same mistakes over and over again, I can't help but get annoyed and extremely frustrated. Oh, and I forgot to mention the 3D. Or should I say, what 3D? I am not a huge 3D fan like some people, but after being blown away at seeing Man of Steel in that format, I figured what the hell. I now wish I hadn't because I can't remember one scene that was shot in 3D. A definite waste of a few extra dollars. A sequel to World War Z is apparently already in the works and I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. On the one hand, I can see the potential because of the way WWZ ends. But I cringe at the thought of sitting through another 2 hours of cliches.Mia @themusescircle.blogspot.com",3,"A Zombie Movie That Had Potential, But Riddled With Cliche After Cliche",1373587200,"07

1489548,A1NIS5QFY6KCT7,B005LAIIMG,Mike the Geology Teacher,"[5, 9]","World War Z is a big budget horror film that imagines a theoretical zombie apocalypse as an extinction event on par with an asteroid impact (Armageddon) or climate change (Day After Tomorrow) or a geological catastrophe (The Core). By combining two genres the film makers made a movie that succeeded as both a horror film and a disaster film.Brad Pitt plays Garry Lane, a former top secret United Nations investigators who spent years working in many of the world's most dangerous hot spots. Exactly what Gary did for the UN isn't completely explained, but suffice it to say that it involved lots of danger and time away from his family. When the movie begins, he's retired from his dangerous life and enjoying the role of stay-at-home dad. He's on a family trip when zombies begin running amuck. Stranded in a strange city, with zombies biting and turning everyone they see, he must lead his family to safety.Help comes in the form of a UN helicopter that takes Gary and his family to a U.S. Navy ship. But sanctuary comes with a price. Non essential personnel cannot stay on the ship. So to keep his family safe he agrees to lead a mission to determine the source of the zombie virus outbreak. That mission takes him first to Korea, then to Israel (where Israeli Defense Forces are protecting Arab refugees from the zombie swarm), to France...all in search of clues to the outbreak's origin.I've never been a big Brad Pitt fan, but he did a great job playing the quick thinking UN investigator. He also had well written script to work with.A Note for the zombie cinema fans out there. The zombies in World War Z are the fast moving 28 Days Later zombies, not the slow shuffling Walking Dead zombies. Since WWZ was written as much as a disaster film than as a horror film, the writers and director attempt to scientifically flush out the idea of a zombie outbreak, and do a pretty good job of it.

1489558,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B005LAIIMG,mitchell5954,"[1, 3]","World War Z, I thought, was a nice new approach to the zombie apocalypse.  I will say that this is now my third favorite zombie movie (first two being Zombieland and Scooby Doo on Zombie Island).  World War Z has a much different feel to it than most zombie films, at least ones that I have seen.Brad Pitt does a good job in this movie.  I think this is his best performance in a while.  I like his character, Gerry Lane, because you can easily sympathize with him, and he is proactive.  I like how Gerry has a military background which plays a big role in the story.  The other characters are not really worth mentioning.  Gerry's family is not given anything to do after they escape the city in the beginning of the movie.  They just sit around on a ship for most of the film and occasionally give Gerry a call to remind us that they are still in the film.  The majority of the other characters are introduced and then killed off just as quickly.  The other ""supposedly"" major characters do not appear until the third act, and we do not know anything about them.There are a lot of things that make World War Z relatively new and refreshing compared to previous zombie flicks.  First is that rather than starting the movie off in the midst of the zombie outbreak (which most zombie films do) this movie shows us the beginning of the zombie apocalypse and all the chaos that ensues from it.  Also, most zombie films take place in relatively remote locations and revolve around a small group of civilians trying to deal with the new reality.  The movie starts out like that, but once they escape New York the movie shifts gears.  Rather than just showing the effects of the zombie apocalypse in one area this movie takes place over several locations and how the people in each location are dealing with the outbreak.We also get a lot of scenes involving the military and how they are dealing with the situation, which we rarely see in other incarnations.  There are also many action scenes with the military vs. zombies which are the best scenes in the movie.  The film is titled World War Z, so I expected lots of action, and I got that.  I also like how the main character is trying to find a cure throughout the movie.  Usually in zombie movies it is just people in the midst of the zombie outbreak and them dealing with it.  By the end he more or less does find a solution.  I like that it was not all in vain.  This is one of the few zombie movies to end on a somewhat triumphant note.The effects are alright.  There are many instances of obvious CGI with the zombies.  However there are also scenes that use practical effects which I am thankful for.  The score was okay, but nothing great.People have said that the 3D is not that good.  However I did not see the film in 3D, so I cannot comment on that.  I also have not read the source material, so I cannot compare them.  However, I have heard that the film greatly deviates from the book.  Fans of the book might not like this movie.Overall, I think World War Z is pretty good zombie film.  It is definitely one of my favorites of the genre.  Fans of the book should use caution when viewing this, because it is not really like the book.  However, I do recommend this to all who are fans of zombie movies.",4,A Refreshing Take on Zombies!,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,3264,"['World', 'War', 'Z', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'new', 'approach', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'will', 'say', 'now', 'third', 'favorite', 'zombie', 'movie', 'first', 'two', 'being', 'Zombieland', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Zombie', 'Island', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'much', 'different', 'feel', 'most', 'zombie', 'films', 'least', 'ones', 'have', 'seen.Brad', 'Pitt', 'good', 'job', 'movie', 'think', 'best', 'performance', 'while', 'character', 'Gerry', 'Lane', 'can', 'easily', 'sympathize', 'proactive', 'how', 'Gerry', 'military', 'background', 'big', 'role', 'story', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Gerry', 'family', 'not', 'given', 'anything', 'do', 'escape', 'city', 'beginning', 'movie', 'just', 'sit', 'around', 'ship', 'most', 'film', 'occasionally', 'give', 'Gerry', 'call', 'remind', 'are', 'still', 'film', 'majority', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'then', 'killed', 'off', 'just', 'quickly', 'other', 'supposedly', 'major', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'third', 'act', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'anything', 'are', 'lot', 'things', 'make', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'relatively', 'new', 'refreshing', 'compared', 'previous', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'First', 'rather', 'starting', 'movie', 'midst', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'most', 'zombie', 'films', 'do', 'movie', 'beginning', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'chaos', 'Also', 'most', 'zombie', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'relatively', 'remote', 'locations', 'revolve', 'small', 'group', 'civilians', 'trying', 'deal', 'new', 'reality', 'movie', 'out', 'once', 'escape', 'New', 'York', 'movie', 'shifts', 'gears', 'Rather', 'just', 'showing', 'effects', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'one', 'area', 'movie', 'place', 'several', 'locations', 'how', 'people', 'location', 'are', 'dealing', 'outbreak.We', 'also', 'get', 'lot', 'scenes', 'involving', 'military', 'how', 'are', 'dealing', 'situation', 'rarely', 'see', 'other', 'incarnations', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'action', 'scenes', 'military', 'vs.', 'zombies', 'are', 'best', 'scenes', 'movie', 'film', 'titled', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'so', 'expected', 'lots', 'action', 'got', 'also', 'how', 'main', 'character', 'trying', 'find', 'cure', 'movie', 'Usually', 'zombie', 'movies', 'just', 'people', 'midst', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'dealing', 'end', 'more', 'less', 'find', 'solution', 'was', 'not', 'vain', 'one', 'few', 'zombie', 'movies', 'end', 'somewhat', 'triumphant', 'note.The', 'effects', 'are', 'alright', 'are', 'many', 'instances', 'obvious', 'CGI', 'zombies', 'However', 'are', 'also', 'scenes', 'use', 'practical', 'effects', 'am', 'thankful', 'score', 'was', 'okay', 'nothing', 'great.People', 'have', 'said', '3D', 'not', 'good', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'film', '3D', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'also', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'source', 'material', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'However', 'have', 'heard', 'film', 'greatly', 'book', 'Fans', 'book', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'movie.Overall', 'think', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'pretty', 'good', 'zombie', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'favorites', 'genre', 'Fans', 'book', 'should', 'use', 'caution', 'when', 'viewing', 'not', 'really', 'book', 'However', 'do', 'recommend', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'zombie', 'movies']",World War Z

1489567,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005LAIIMG,M. Oleson,"[4, 8]","Zombies or their equivalent appear to be the monsters of choice these days.  They've even populated comedies.  And now one of filmdom's biggest stars, Brad Pitt, joins the battle.  He plays Gerry Lane, a former United Nations agent known for getting in and out of hot spots.  He's not a para-military type.  Quite the contrary.  Now retired and spending ""quality"" time with his wife Karin (Mireille Enos from TV's ""The Killing"") and their two daughters (Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove), he runs into trouble just after the opening credits.Director Marc Forster wastes no time getting into the action as the Lanes are caught in a traffic jam in downtown Philadelphia.  This early onslaught of zombies never lets up which is one of the great things about this movie.  These zoms run with the speed of Usain Bolt and have no problem hurling themselves at people, windows, vehicles or diving off buildings.  Once a victim is killed he or she will convert in about 10 seconds.Gerry manages to scramble out of harm's way temporarily and manages to get to a tall building where his former UN boss has him picked up.  I don't want to short change this section of the film.  The escape is harrowing and tension filled.  Gerry agrees to work again for the UN in return for relative safety for his family on a Navy ship well off the eastern coast.  His job is to find the source/patient zero and figure out a cure.  This takes him to Korea, then to Israel and finally to Wales.  Along the way he picks up clues that may lead to a possible immunization.Having seen scores of ""R"" rated zombie movies not to mention the carnage on TV's ""The Walking Dead"" I was curious how this film would fare with a PG-13 rating.  So here's the scoop.  We don't see any gore or blood splatters.  Yes, we get some close up zombie makeup and it's very well done.  In the final act, some zombie scientists in the Wales W.H.O. lab are really first rate, especially the one that has Gerry trapped inside a glass storage room.

1489576,A2XVA2OGDYKKD,B005LAIIMG,Monsieur Valentine,"[67, 94]","Much has been said about world war z. This highly anticipated film was to be adapted from max brook's cult following novel. After a bidding war with leonardo dicaprio, brad pitt managed to secure the rights with his production agency. Apparently brad then endured a year of stress to make this film happen. Reports included reshooting, delays, re-writing and an overblown budget. Ironically the critics began to appear from the woodworks, one by one to naw at the prospects of brad's brainy demise. And i have to admit it did not look promising when he was quoted as saying that he chose this role to do something his kids would enjoy. Why would his kids enjoy a horrific world war calamity??The problem for brad pitt, maybe unknowingly, was that the passionately loved book would be incredibly difficult if not impossible to translate into a 2 hour feature movie.  It really deserves a mini-series format.I am not much of book reader, but i was harassed long enough by my house mate such that one night i finally opened the pages. I couldnt put it down thereafter.When i heard they were making this film i wondered how brad would be able to bring together a book which was essentially a series of short stories,  that encompass different characters, places and times to create a world war narrative on a massive global scale. Each chapter has a different protagonist and a different perspective, that gives an insight into the world of a zombie apocalypse. From intimate tales of survival to social commentary to geo-political consequences. The book was intelligent, gripping, and always took itself very seriously.And serious is how most fans of the novel are towards this piece of fiction. Brad pitt had alot to deliver and its not completely unfair for fans to expect a certain level of respect that goes hand in hand with a planned adaptation.Without exaggeration, this film bares almost zero relation to the book. The movie from start to finish never even happened in the textbook. The only premise it took from the original source was the notion that a zombie outbreak occurs on a world wide scale. But why did he purchase the rights to deliver this premise?For those who havent read the book, it obviously appears irrelevant, but for many people like myself it means that a true cinematic adaptation of max brooks novel is no longer possible.

1489577,A20OMCGB73X5LV,B005LAIIMG,Moon Donkey,"[8, 22]","A movie that had the potential to be good, but was screwed up by morons.As with many bad films, there are usually a few really stupid things that happen that ruin the movie.  World War Z is one of these films.After Gerry gets his family to the naval group, he is told by the commanding officer that he must lead a team into Zombie infested South Korea or they will kick his family off of the boat.  The purpose of the mission is to provide assistance and protection to a doctor  who is investigating the virus and looking for a cure.  Gerry is basically forced to agree, but the commander reassures him by telling Gerry that he will have the protection of a team of Navy Seals.Given that the zombie apocalypse is going on, I'd assume that a ""team"" of Navy Seals would be a large number.  Uhhhh... no.  It turns out to be like two guys.  Seriously, it is like two guys... maybe three at the most.  The world rests on this doctor finding a cure and the best they can do is send a couple dudes with machine guns for protection.  Uhhhhh... anyone else find this stupid.  Wouldn't you send an entire platoon, squad, or whatever?Also, why do they travel to South Korea in a giant cargo plane.  Why?  The cargo consists of the doctor, Gerry, and 2 or 3 Navy Seals.  What the heck do they need a giant cargo plane for?  And did that plane take off from the aircraft carrier?  Do aircraft carriers carry planes that size?  Wouldn't it have been faster to take some jets and refuel them in route?  I don't know, maybe I'm crazy.  Watch the movie and explain to me why the big cargo plane was necessary.So anyway, they land in South Korea with their awesome force of like 4-5 guys and quickly find themselves attacked by zombies.  Lucky for them a garrison is at the base.  Unlucky for them, the doctor trips and falls on the platform exiting the plane and shoots himself dead.  Boom!  Dead.  Uhhhh... why?  The plot of the movie sets up this doctor as the savior only to have him kill himself before he gets off the plane?  If they were going to kill off the doctor, why not have him killed by a zombie?  Wouldn't that have that been more entertaining or more interesting?  Was having him shoot himself after tripping really the best way to do it?  Doesn't this whole thing seem incredibly stupid?  Why set up the ""doctor"" character only to kill him shortly thereafter is a very lame and unexciting way?  Am I the only man on earth wondering this?Well, Korea turns out to be pretty lame, so they decide that they better get to Israel because the Israeli's apparently were the first ones to close off their country to keep the zombies out.  Uhhh... except when Gerry arrives he discovers that they really haven't closed off the country.  They are still letting people in.  That doesn't make sense, but whatever.  And where did the giant wall come from?  When did Israel built the walls of Troy around the country?  Or at least around a city?The walls just don't cut it though and the zombies get in, make a mess, etc.  In the middle of the battle, Gerry saves an Israeli soldier (who has been bitten) by chopping her arm off above the bite.  That's cool and everything, but then why does he decide to take her with him?  Sure, the city if being overrun by zombies, but wasn't is a bit odd that Gerry suddenly decides to save a one-armed Israeli soldier?  Uhhhh...But hold on holmes!  I haven't gotten to the two dumbest things yet!  Amazing, I know.Jumping forward in time (after Gerry and the soldier both survive a plane crash which just happens to be walking distance from their WHO destination), Gerry makes his way to some sort of World Health Organization lab.  He needs to get to the viruses in storage, but they must fight through some zombies to get to the vault.  Who goes on this hunt?  Gerry, one dude from the lab, and the one-armed Israeli.  What?  Would you go zombie hunting with a one-armed person?  Heck no.  And what is the number one priority? Stay quiet.  Make no noise.  Ok, so guess what the one-armed Israeli does when she sees a zombie.  Bam!  She shoots him with her pistol.  They took an ax, a bat, and a crowbar in order to be quiet and the first thing she does is pull out the pistol... which the other zombies hear of course.  Shockingly stupid.But to take the cake, it turns out that the way to hide from the zombies is to inject yourself with a lethal pathogen.  The zombies won't attack you if you are already infected with some other nasty virus.  Uhh... Why?  Has anyone been watching the zombies in this movie? Did you see how fast they are?  How they jump people?  How they smash their faces through windows to get at people?  Does it look to you like any of them have time to stop and take a wiff before biting someone?  And why would this zombie virus give a damn?  So what if someone is infected with something else?  Guess what, now you can be infected with a zombie virus too!  Double the pleasure, double the fun.  What - did the zombie virus come up with a way to detect other viruses and then make judgments about how lethal they were?  Chicken Pox no but Measles yes?  Common cold no but Bird Flu yes?  What the heck?Oh - almost forgot!  Earlier in the movie Gerry and his family are joined by a little hispanic kid when they escape Jersey in a helicopter.  How did that kid make it to the roof?  Huh?  The last we saw of him before that was inside his apartment with zombies knocking at the door.  Also, we know that the staircase up to the roof is full of zombies.  So how does that kid get around all of the zombies to make it up there?  Regardless, why does it even matter?  The kid plays no part in the plot whatsoever, so why not just have the zombies eat him?Very poorly done.",1,Apparently one-armed Israeli soldiers are idiots,1379289600,"09 16,

They are gross and generally decaying.  Replace Brad Pitt with another actor and I think this movie would have been a complete dump. Okay I like Brad.  There were parts of the movie that were okay, but in general long, drawn out and boring. Mireille Enos from (The Killing) is an excellent actor, but in this roll she was written in as this kinda mousy wife that pretty much just waits for Brad to come back to her and the kids in one piece.  Her holding the phone were some excellent scenes (being sarcastic).  She is capable of so much more, but just played a third or fourth or whatever rate actor to Brad.  It was his show and the zombies.  The computer generated kind.  There were just so darned many they could only have done it this way.  Okay.  Basically the story line was good, but it just took way to long to get there.  And then the likely hood of how to defeat them had to do with an enormous (let's say impossible) amount of luck.

This was a crazy summer for Hollywood across the board. Zombies continue to be hot and an early 2015 sequel would be nice, a Halloween 2014 release would be even better.

I prefer to describe the film as ""inspired by the book of the same name."" We are dropped into the home life of Brad Pitt & Merielle Enos adn their two young daughters with no explanation or context. Just what we can pick up from the TV and radio chatter heard in the background. Very, very quickly, everything goes--as a friend from the UK likes to say--pear-shaped. Again, without warning or explanation. This is the film's chief virtue. For as long as possible, director Marc Forster keeps his audience off-balance...and frightened. This are not the zombies of George Romero or Robert Kirkman. This is a worldwide pandemic that is moving far too fast. As Pitt's character, Gerry Lane, takes his worldwide investigation (as a UN consultant) to Israel, the story starts to falter. An attack is instigated for the seemingly sole reason of getting Gerry OUT of Israel and into an airplane and onto his final stop. This attack is completely aviodable. By this point in the film, what attracts the infected to the healthy (loud noise and activity) is well-known. Yet, a celebration (amplified with HUGE speakers!!) is allowed to occur NEAR the giant wall built to keep the undead out. GUESS what happens?!? Once on the plane, we are treated to one more thrilling fright before arriving in Wales for this film's resolution. It is well-known that the ending was reshot and delayed release of the film. It is the weakest section of the picture. Pitt's voice-over narration as the film concludes leaves the door open for a sequel. As WWZ turned out to be a financial success, the sequel is possible. I can't see it being more than a 'bug hunt' (sorry, Pvt. Hudson). Certainly a different kind of action film. I watched WWZ alone and then again with my wife and a third time with a friend. It was fun to watch the shock of others and I wasn't bored. The holes become obvious, though. The BD looked and sounded great on my 57"" DLP screen and 7.2 surround system.

But I did see the first trailer for this many months ago (it's from the very beginning of the movie, where Brad Pitt and his movie family is stuck in the car in Phillie), and I was genuinely excited and very much looking forward to seeing this. Then all of the negativity started seeping from seemingly everywhere (multiple scene reshoots! budget overruns! nonsensical plot!). I mean, the movie critic at the Financial Times, whom I happen to respect quite a bit, rated this movie zero stars, ZERO! My son and I finally saw the movie this weekend in the theatre.""World War Z"" (2013 release; 116 min.) starts off with Gerry Lane (played by Brad Pitt) and his family (wife and 2 young daughters) having breakfast while keeping an eye on the TV, broadcasting disturbing news about rabies-reminding symptoms breaking out everywhere. Next thing we know, the Lane family is stuck in a traffic jam in downtown Phillie, and all mayhem breaks loose. Those 10-15 min. in downtown Phillie are some of the most intense minutes I can recall seeing in a movie in a long, long time, and after that we are off to the races. To tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience and hence pointless.Several comments: the initial 80 min. of the movie (ending with the crash in Wales) are nothing short of flawless, indeed the most thrilling and intense movie viewing that I have experienced in a long time. The uncertainty, anxiety and utter chaos all feel very real. Forget that this is a ""zombie"" movie, as it is more about a movie where the human race is fighting for its very survival. The last 40 min. are not quite as stellar (and hence I can't rate this movie 5 stars), where the producers seemingly were struggling in how to bring it all home and wrap it up in a sensible and believable manner. At that, they succeed, but the visuals simply cannot compete with those of earlier action scenes in the movie. All that aside, I would strongly urge you to forget about all of the negative stuff you've been hearing or reading about this movie, as ""World War Z"" is shockingly good and makes for a very intense movie experience. Both my son and I simply loved it. We saw the movie in 3D and I didn't think it added much to the experience, so save those extra $3 or 4 bucks and see it in 2D.

Unless of course, they are the zombies of World War Z. Never have dead people run so fast, gathered so close without biting one another, or chased anyone so diligently. Brad Pitt is great, his character is not superhuman, nor endowed with any super power other than his own abiding faith in himself, his love for his family, and his weapons that do not take him all the way to the end of the war. No, this hero uses whatever is at hand, a gun when available, an iron pipe if not, or his own hands if it comes down to it. And it does. He is great - BUT - (wait for it...), the zombies are fantastic! Never has a movie depicted the dead literally flowing across the screen, over fifty foot high walls with or without machine gun wielding living bodies on top. They swarm across rooftops, oblivious to the fact the roof ends with a sixty story drop to the street. They race down hallways unconcerned for their safety or well-being, and even attack when there is no hope of victory...proving they are zombies after-all. Suspense is limited however by the same factors and this nearly cost it a star - but not quite. I've come to expect the dead to generate less suspense or awe-inspiring fear than say a power-hungry Emperor with a space armada at his disposal and a henchman who breathes through a mask and talks really deeply! But the dead CAN and DO generate a visceral fear that I cannot explain, am at a complete loss to fathom and yet find myself at the edge of my seat with my hair standing on end, (even in my nose! which takes a bit really!). A must see flick for the morbidly obsessed zombie fan, or anyone who can devour a bucket of popcorn, large box of SnoCaps, and gallon of Coca-Cola in under three hours.

Look what the &#34;Night of the Living Dead&#34; has grown into. There are a lot of zombie themed films and books and stuff about. So, why watch one more? This one is from a main line studio with A list stars and a moving plot. A fast moving plot...that follows how a plague could travel the planet in days accurately. Only this plague is a virus that causes zombies. Brad Pitt stars as a retired United Nations &#34;troubleshooter&#34; for the Secretary General who gets unwillingly recalled to the job by the emergency of the wildfire infection racing around the world. We go from Philadelphia to a US Navy task force evacuation fleet off the coast of New Jersey, to South Korea, Israel, and finally a World Health Organization research facility in Cardiff Wales. All in about thirty hours time. The pace of the film is frenetic  due to the rapid spread of an unknown virus. And I mean rapid...from bite by an infected zombie to a full blown dead and biting zombie in TWELVE SECONDS. Can Gerry (Brad Pitt) find the source of the plague and a means to an antidote or vaccination? Watch it and find out...and do not expect all happy stuff as thermopile concludes.I liked this film. I enjoy the growing zombie rage in entertainment. Hey, when I was a teen, one of my favorite singing groups WAS &#34; The Zombies&#34;(&#34;She's Not There&#34;)!  I never miss the best series on TV, &#34;THE WALKING DEAD&#34; , so of course I had to get this one. I enjoy all the different &#34; takes&#34; on zombies by different writers, directors, creators, make-up artists, etc. But these World War Z zombies are not your everyday &#34;Walkers&#34; stumbling by eating people. These zombies are FAST! They run, they climb stuff well and quickly, they break glass easily, and they aren't biting you to feed..they bite to spread the virus...that seems their only drive once infected. WOW.  Seeing a major city overrun in minutes is chilling to watch...and to me, the best and most jarring scene is the virus being spread on an airliner in flight..with our hero on the plane with an idea for antidote about to be infected...a hand grenade can sure be useful!!Watch this one to see what I'm talking about.

I suppose people expect some blood and gore when it comes to zombie movies, and that is usually a major factor that hardcore zombie fans expect, but it's nice that the film manages to be pretty slick and entertaining without much of it. The special effects are really rather great at times, especially how the zombies are presented as being extremely vicious and rabid.They climb upon one another by the hundreds trying to scale the tall walls of fortified cities. At a distance they look like armies of ants piled one upon another. This is the niftiest thing about this movie. These zombies are very fast and very determined. It's also pretty refreshing that when they &#34;turn&#34; they don't really look all evil and rotted out like they do in some zombie movies, they just look like regular people who appear slightly less alive. Over time they begin to morph into something more sinister looking. The sounds they make with their vocal chords are pretty creepy, and they did manage to put a frieght into me. They are rather scary, though not all that unique from zombies of the past.If it had not been for the suprb AMC zombie epic &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; with it's extreme gore and powerful story telling being still very much on the minds of many zombie fans, this one might have seemed a little more endearing to some people. But as it seems to be suggested by the many less than  impressed reviews, zombie fans have the AMC series and much better movies to reference on their minds, such as Night of the livind Dead, Both Dawn Of The Dead and it's remake, 28 Days Later, and numerous other zombie movies.In my opinion Brad Pitt seems a bit miscast for this kind of role. It really is a rather obvious departure from most of the roles he's chosen. Then again I'm trying to imagine who could have been cast in this and would have fit the role better. Liam Neeson? Keifer Sutherland? Maybe Cruise or Hanks? Na, don't think so. Pitt moves along with this role perfectly fine, but he just seems not only a bit out of his normal territory, but it's also hard to imagine him with the sort of job title that get's him elected to take on the task of helping end the pandemic in the first place.Over all the story is interesting, and the action is often very good, but the movie just seems to be lacking a great deal that would make it memorable. Most of the characters in the movie and the actors that play them seem rather cookie cutter and the performances and characters are not particularly great. This film has more visual appeal that it does a great plot, story and character development. And much of the script is fairly bland. This is certainly entertaining, but as zombie movies go there's not a great deal to chew on here.",3,"Creative with a certain sense of style, otherwise average zombie flick",1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,3034,"['tale', 'up', 'few', 'interesting', 'twists', 'pretty', 'cool', 'special', 'effects', 'zombie', 'films', 'go', 'not', 'memorable', 'One', 'thing', 'was', 'missing', 'way', 'good', 'also', 'way-', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'literally', ""n't"", 'much', 'blood', 'gore', 'maybe', 'even', 'none', 'suppose', 'people', 'expect', 'blood', 'gore', 'when', 'zombie', 'movies', 'usually', 'major', 'factor', 'hardcore', 'zombie', 'fans', 'expect', 'nice', 'film', 'be', 'pretty', 'slick', 'entertaining', 'much', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'really', 'rather', 'great', 'times', 'especially', 'how', 'zombies', 'are', 'presented', 'being', 'extremely', 'vicious', 'rabid.They', 'climb', 'one', 'hundreds', 'trying', 'scale', 'tall', 'walls', 'fortified', 'cities', 'distance', 'look', 'armies', 'ants', 'piled', 'one', 'upon', 'niftiest', 'thing', 'movie', 'zombies', 'are', 'very', 'fast', 'very', 'determined', 'also', 'pretty', 'refreshing', 'when', '34', 'turn', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'evil', 'rotted', 'out', 'do', 'zombie', 'movies', 'just', 'look', 'regular', 'people', 'who', 'appear', 'slightly', 'less', 'alive', 'time', 'begin', 'morph', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'looking', 'sounds', 'make', 'vocal', 'chords', 'are', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'did', 'manage', 'put', 'frieght', 'are', 'rather', 'scary', 'not', 'unique', 'zombies', 'past.If', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'suprb', 'AMC', 'zombie', 'epic', '34', 'Walking', 'Dead', '34', 'extreme', 'gore', 'powerful', 'story', 'telling', 'being', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'minds', 'many', 'zombie', 'fans', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'seemed', 'little', 'more', 'endearing', 'people', 'be', 'suggested', 'many', 'less', 'impressed', 'reviews', 'zombie', 'fans', 'have', 'AMC', 'series', 'much', 'better', 'movies', 'reference', 'minds', 'such', 'Night', 'livind', 'Dead', 'Both', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'remake', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'numerous', 'other', 'zombie', 'movies.In', 'opinion', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'bit', 'miscast', 'kind', 'role', 'really', 'rather', 'obvious', 'departure', 'most', 'roles', 'chosen', 'Then', 'again', ""'m"", 'trying', 'imagine', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'role', 'better', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'Maybe', 'Cruise', 'Hanks', 'Na', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'Pitt', 'along', 'role', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'just', 'not', 'only', 'bit', 'normal', 'territory', 'also', 'hard', 'imagine', 'sort', 'job', 'title', 'get', 'elected', 'take', 'task', 'helping', 'end', 'pandemic', 'first', 'place.Over', 'story', 'interesting', 'action', 'often', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'be', 'lacking', 'great', 'deal', 'would', 'make', 'memorable', 'Most', 'characters', 'movie', 'actors', 'play', 'seem', 'rather', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'performances', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'great', 'film', 'more', 'visual', 'appeal', 'great', 'plot', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'much', 'script', 'fairly', 'bland', 'certainly', 'entertaining', 'zombie', 'movies', 'go', 'not', 'great', 'deal', 'chew', 'here']",World War Z

1489689,A2JFKSHR0WQB8C,B005LAIIMG,QuickSilverSeven,"[64, 87]","As a big zombie fan, if we watch World War Z, knowing it's intended to be a PG-13 movie, we'll know right away this isn't going to feature the blood and guts like any R or unrated zombie movie you've seen. Would it have been more drastic and horrifying with gore? Probably, but what is not seen and imagined can also be effective (see the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre).Keeping that in mind, WWZ delivers on its intentions. Put yourself in the shoes of the lead character, and you're cast into a hellish world where a sudden outbreak of ""rabies"" as they first called it, spreads like wildfire in the cities, causing havoc all around. In a desperate effort to escape the horror, Pitt's character's goal is to get his family to safety, and in doing so, is obligated to find the origin of the disease that has taken over the entire world.WWZ is tension filled most of the way, and fills the screen with overwhelming amounts of zombies in some very unique and original ways not often seen in a zombie movie. These zombies are dormant shamblers when not stimulated by movers. But sound instigates them, and they sprint to ""life"", attempting to bite anyone who can serve as a host (which brings up a major plot point by the way). The ending sequence closes the film brilliantly, requiring some clever tactics along with agility and speed, as the zombies tend to amplify their ability to run and leap, oftentimes, jumping off rooftops, smashing to the ground, getting up and continuing the chase.Zombies Locations: Major City, Israel desert city, airplane, night time airport, day time airport, apartment building, Research Facility with white painted walls (which would have been perfect for some blood if this was R).3D: The 3D in WWZ looks very dimensional, with visible pieces that bring depth at a higher level you'd expect a 3D film to render it. A success in 3D, which also increases the dread of each horror scene. In addition to the powered 3D dimension, there are many instances where objects pop out of the screen, worthy of a good flinch back.Movie: 4.8/53D: 4/5",5,WWZ 3D Review: Cool Zombie movie and 3D,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,2070,"['big', 'zombie', 'fan', 'watch', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'knowing', 'intended', 'be', 'PG-13', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'know', 'right', 'away', ""n't"", 'going', 'feature', 'blood', 'guts', 'R', 'unrated', 'zombie', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'drastic', 'horrifying', 'gore', 'Probably', 'what', 'not', 'seen', 'imagined', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'effective', 'see', 'original', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', '.Keeping', 'mind', 'WWZ', 'intentions', 'Put', 'shoes', 'lead', 'character', ""'re"", 'cast', 'hellish', 'world', 'where', 'sudden', 'outbreak', 'rabies', 'first', 'called', 'wildfire', 'cities', 'causing', 'havoc', 'around', 'desperate', 'effort', 'escape', 'horror', 'Pitt', 'character', 'goal', 'get', 'family', 'safety', 'doing', 'so', 'obligated', 'find', 'origin', 'disease', 'taken', 'over', 'entire', 'world.WWZ', 'tension', 'filled', 'most', 'way', 'screen', 'overwhelming', 'amounts', 'zombies', 'very', 'unique', 'original', 'ways', 'not', 'often', 'seen', 'zombie', 'movie', 'zombies', 'are', 'dormant', 'shamblers', 'when', 'not', 'stimulated', 'movers', 'sound', 'sprint', 'life', 'attempting', 'bite', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'serve', 'host', 'up', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'way', 'ending', 'sequence', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'requiring', 'clever', 'tactics', 'agility', 'speed', 'zombies', 'tend', 'amplify', 'ability', 'run', 'leap', 'oftentimes', 'jumping', 'off', 'rooftops', 'smashing', 'ground', 'getting', 'up', 'continuing', 'chase.Zombies', 'Locations', 'Major', 'City', 'Israel', 'desert', 'city', 'airplane', 'night', 'time', 'airport', 'day', 'time', 'airport', 'apartment', 'building', 'Research', 'Facility', 'white', 'painted', 'walls', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'blood', 'was', 'R', '.3D', '3D', 'WWZ', 'very', 'dimensional', 'visible', 'pieces', 'bring', 'depth', 'higher', 'level', ""'d"", 'expect', '3D', 'film', 'render', 'success', '3D', 'also', 'dread', 'horror', 'scene', 'addition', 'powered', '3D', 'dimension', 'are', 'many', 'instances', 'where', 'objects', 'pop', 'screen', 'worthy', 'good', 'flinch', 'back.Movie', '4.8/53D', '4/5']",World War Z

The number one killer of this movie is the same as practically any kind of horror movie (though this is more action than horror)-predictability.  Brad Pitt does a good job in the lead role, but it's the stereotype of an action hero who can fight anyone and eventually uncovers a solution no one else can.  Watching it you know the end will be Brad Pitt figuring out a puzzle the world's top experts can't.  And that's exactly what happens.  A guy who's basically a glorified cop figures out a medical problem the world's top doctors can't?  There's also a lot of unfilled holes in the plot.  How did Brad Pitt know the people the zombies were ignoring were infected with terminal illnesses.  Why did the zombie in the plane stow away and wait?  Max Brooks himself says a zombie has no mind, it simply acts to spread the virus, and virtually every zombie in the movie acts like that.  Why was one intelligent enough to wait for the right moment?  There's more but I won't submit them all.I'm not saying it's a bad movie, I did enjoy watching it.  But I am saying it's just another superhero action guy main character saves everything, nothing more.  So watch it, enjoy it.  Just don't expect any plot twist you haven't seen a thousand times already.  You WILL know everything that happens before it actually does.One final note, I expected Max Brooks to at least make a cameo.  Let down there.

There Pitt contacts the Secretary of the U.N.who will send a helicopter to rescue him and his family.The family is eventually spirited away to a ship off the New York coast.It seems Pitt was a former forces member who the Navy wants to redeploy to help them with this sudden outbreak of a deadly virus on the human population.Pitt takes a team to Korea,with a virologist in tow.The virologist is killed and there is no credible lead there as to the nature of the viral outbreak anyway.What is left of the group flies next to Jerusalem.The city is under siege and has erected a wall to keep the zombies out.They got tipped off by some intelligence just before the outbreak.While there Pitt witnesses a Muslim group,brought into the city,celebrate over loudspeakers.The loud noise attracts the zombies outside the wall who try enmass to enter.(the scene in the trailers showing this human wave trying to climb over each other up a wall,is that moment).The zombies enter the city and it is a mad dash to leave by plane.Pitt and an Israeli soldier make it onto an airliner.The airliner flies them to Wales and to a World Health Organization outpost.During the flight a zombie has got aboard somehow and it has infected just about the entire plane.It crash lands in the Wales countryside.Pitt and the soldier make it to the WHO compound.The compound itself is under siege by some of its own former staff.The ones left figure out that the zombies don't touch those that are lame or sick.Pitt manages to make it to a section of the labs that has some pathogens stored there.Pitt injects himself with some and he is able to walk right by them untouched.This leads to a viral serum being developed which gives the armed forces a big advantage in containing the threat and Pitt is reunited with his family in Nova Scotia.Not only is Pitt so utterly vanilla in this picture,the film has quite amateurish S/FX.Any scene,such as the zombies climbing over each other to scale tall walls,like the Jerusalem scene,are terribly fake looking.On top of this,the film just cannot strike a moment where it can generate any level of excitement or tension for any length of time.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1.There are no specials.All in all this movie is the Pitts,and that's where alot of the blame lies for its feel.He holds any modicum of emotion in check and thus exudes no enthusiasm from the viewers perspective.The film itself has a second rate script(seen it all before)and it fails in its own job to create any excitement.Go watch any Resident Evil film and get some proper zombie kicks,not this RE wanna be.Zzzzzzz.2 1/2-3 stars.",3,Welcome to World War Zzzzzzzz,1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,3428,"['World', 'War', 'Z', 'released', 'June/13', 'stars',

There was nothing particularly special about it.  And, unfortunately, all the better scenes are in the two-minute trailer, so there's nothing really surprising about it.  The storyline dealt more with investigating the medical/biological source of the ""zombie"" affliction than the zombies themselves.  The zombies, in fact, felt like a plot device to drive the investigative angle of the story - nothing more.  For that reason, I found the film a bit disappointing and would not be interested in seeing it again.

The dead walk the earth, but in this case they run super fast and infect you. Most zombie movies are about survival and sadly most of the cast don't make it. You endure a whole lot of body munching, screaming, and gore. In World War Z, you move past that because there is no survival for anyone if they don't figure out how to neutralize the zombie infestation. So it's a mystery wrapped in an apocalyptic thriller. If you've always wanted to watch a zombie flick but were scared of entrails all over the place, this is the movie for you. Plus Brad Pitt is so very awesome in it.

1489762,A1SBRISKS7PH7U,B005LAIIMG,Rob,"[6, 13]","An extremely impressive entry in the zombie genre and for me easily the best such since 1977's Dawn of the Dead. WWZ may break one of the supposed rules of the genre in its almost complete absence of gore but Brad Pitt's film more than compensates with an efficiently plotted linear storyline that remarkably shows no obvious signs of its troubled production, a spectacular sense of scale, a satisfactory balance between action and emotion rare in summer blockbusters and an often intense breakneck pace.There's a lot that I liked about WWZ, from the way the film utilizes its fast moving zombies as a symbol of the often frightening speed and density of everyday life, to supporting characters who are introduced only to be killed off without any of the bombast you'd have had to endure had the movie been directed by a Zack Snyder or Michael Bay. The emotional heart of the story - UN hotshot Gerry Lane's (Brad Pitt) relationship with his wife and kids - feels refreshingly damped down rather than overblown, believable without being schmaltzy. Rich and famous he may be but there's an interesting grounded quality to Pitt. Casting him as an Everyman sort of character doesn't seem like the kind of stretch it would if you had the likes of DiCaprio or Tom Cruise starring.The story is a ground-breaking amalgamation of zombie horror and one of those plague stories in which the hero is charged with finding a cure. The plot, which sends Gerry from Philly to South Korea, to Israel and then Wales in pursuit of the infection's source, never feels like it's just marking time.  Each location holds a clue and by the time Gerry figures out the ingenious solution en route to the film's climax the story tops even that by forcing our hero to make a virtual life or death decision. The payoff includes what might be the most well earned and enjoyable onscreen drink since Ice Cold In Alex.The action sequences are sensational with the (rightly) much talked about Israeli siege a standout. The chaos which leads to a hectic chase through narrow streets covered by a wire fence over which swarm countless zombies leads to an even more claustrophobic showdown inside a jumbo jet. The film is genuinely unnerving, often tense - especially the final third - and sometimes jump out of your seat scary. All without any bad language or explicit gore. There's a lesson there.Littered with unexpected touches - the viewer's shock at a would be suicide jump by a certain character who fears he's been infected and can't bear to see his family in danger, a female Israeli IDF soldier who becomes an unexpected ally of Gerry's and who isn't saddled with a lame romantic sub-plot between her and the star, a nuclear blast viewed from the cockpit of a plane in which no words, no explanation are offered and don't need to be (at this point in the movie it truly looks like game over for mankind) and perhaps best of all a last act that eschews the empty spectacle of so many summer blockbusters and goes instead for a tense, low-key and genuinely intimate climax that I'm happy to acknowledge had me on the edge of my seat.But perhaps best of all is the film's underlying message, epitomized by an Israeli who tells Pitt's character that 'For every life we save, it's one less enemy we have to fight.' This is a movie about the end of the world that unlike so many other zombie films shows people refusing to retreat into small survivalist groups but instead doing their best to save as many lives as they can. It does not surprise me in the least that World War Z has defied months of hostile online sniping to become a big box office hit and I'm very happy it has.

Zwick,"[0, 0]","Based on the book by Max Brooks, &#8220;World War Z&#8221; is a gripping, adrenaline-pumping thriller about a worldwide zombie apocalypse (a phrase that is fast becoming one of the most overused in modern pop culture).Brad Pitt plays a retired UN employee, now stay-at-home dad, who barely makes it out of Philadelphia alive with his wife (&#8220;The Killing&#8217;s Mireille Enos in a largely insignificant role) and two little daughters as the zombie attacks spring up seemingly out of nowhere.  Because of his previous experience maneuvering through arduous situations, he is sent out into the world to find answers as to how the plague may have started and to discover what possible remedies there might be to keep the human race from literally devouring itself into nonexistence.These are not the shambling, foot-dragging zombies of the Romero films or TV&#8217;s &#8220;The Walking Dead.&#8221; They&#8217;re not only fleet of foot but are able to scale seemingly impenetrable walls by piling one on top of the other like a cheerleader pyramid on steroids (in their speed, they actually have more in common with the creatures in the &#8220;24 Days Later&#8221; series). This may make them a lot harder to outrun, but it robs them of some of the creepiness we normally associate with the zombie figure.Because the movie is done on a global rather than intimate scale, it lacks the haunting, soul-searing dread and emotional desolation of a work like &#8220;The Walking Dead.&#8221; In contrast, &#8220;Z&#8221; feels more like a grand action movie but, even as such, it hits all the right notes. Thanks to Brooks&#8217; beat-the-clock scenario (adapted herein by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof) and Marc Foster&#8217;s full-throttle direction, the audience rarely gets the chance to relax the muscles, as we hurtle right along with Pitt from one close-call encounter with a baffling, seemingly intractable enemy to the next.Not all that memorable really, but entertaining while it&#8217;s going on.",4,Fast-moving action film,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,2030,"['Based', 'book', 'Max', 'Brooks', '8220', 'World', 'War', 'Z', '8221', 'gripping', 'adrenaline-pumping', 'thriller', 'worldwide', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'phrase', 'fast', 'becoming', 'one', 'most', 'overused', 'modern', 'pop', 'culture', '.Brad', 'Pitt', 'retired', 'UN', 'employee', 'now', 'stay-at-home', 'dad', 'who', 'barely', 'Philadelphia', 'alive', 'wife', '8220', 'Killing', '8217', 'Mireille', 'Enos', 'largely', 'insignificant', 'role', 'two', 'little', 'daughters', 'zombie', 'attacks', 'spring', 'up', 'seemingly', 'nowhere', 'previous', 'experience', 'maneuvering', 'arduous', 'situations', 'sent', 'out', 'world', 'find', 'answers', 'how', 'plague', 'may', 'have', 'started', 'discover', 'what', 'possible', 'remedies', 'might', 'be', 'keep', 'human', 'race', 'literally', 'devouring', 'nonexistence.These', 'are', 'not', 'shambling', 'foot-dragging', 'zombies', 'Romero', 'films', 'TV', '8217', '8220', 'Walking', 'Dead.', '8221', '8217', 'not', 'only', 'fleet', 'foot', 'are', 'able', 'scale', 'seemingly', 'impenetrable', 'walls', 'piling', 'one', 'top', 'other', 'cheerleader', 'pyramid', 'steroids', 'speed', 'actually', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'creatures', '8220', '24', 'Days', 'Later', '8221', 'series', 'may', 'make', 'lot', 'harder', 'outrun', 'creepiness', 'normally', 'associate', 'zombie', 'movie', 'done', 'global', 'rather', 'intimate', 'scale', 'haunting', 'soul-searing', 'dread', 'emotional', 'desolation', 'work', '8220', 'Walking', 'Dead.', '8221', 'contrast', '8220', 'Z', '8221', 'feels', 'more', 'grand', 'action', 'movie', 'even', 'such', 'right', 'notes', 'Thanks', 'Brooks', '8217', 'beat-the-clock', 'scenario', 'adapted', 'herein', 'Matthew', 'Michael', 'Carnahan', 'Drew', 'Goddard', 'Damon', 'Lindelof', 'Marc', 'Foster', '8217', 'full-throttle', 'direction', 'audience', 'rarely', 'chance', 'relax', 'muscles', 'hurtle', 'right', 'Pitt', 'one', 'close-call', 'encounter', 'baffling', 'seemingly', 'intractable', 'enemy', 'next.Not', 'memorable', 'really', 'entertaining', '8217', 'going']",World War Z

Olson Jr. ""The Colonel""","[17, 27]","While I love a good action sci-fi thriller, I set aside the sage advice of my former AP U.S. History student, Matthew Normand, who in response to my criticisms of ""Avatar,"" said, ""Colonel, park your brain at the door of the theater and just enjoy the movie.""  Forgive me Matt, but I cannot help myself.World War Z (WWZ) would have been much enjoyable for me if Brad Pitt had paid a bit more attention to detail on various aspects of the story.  While I embrace the concept of zombies, the rapid contamination in a matter of seconds from zombie to human was unrealistic.  Given that rapid rate of infection, how did it spread from India to Korea without sending up red flags all over the world?  For that matter, how did it spread across oceans to the U.S.?  What did the zombies eat?  It appeared that their only motivation was to infect others.WWZ should have used some other organization than the United Nations.  The UN has no robust standing military command structure or forces.  A much better and more plausible scenario would have been using NATO instead of the UN, replacing the UN deputy secretary general with the U.S. vice-president, and casting Brad Pitt as a former member of Seal Team Six.While I respect the Mossad, I question how they were able to take unbelievably rapid action in response to a radio intercept of an Indian general reporting fighting the ""undead.""  The Israelis ability to construct a wall around Jerusalem before the onset of the zombies strains credulity.  What would have been the reaction of the rest of the world?  I also found it unfathomable that the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) would not have complete and solid surveillance on all parts of the wall to prevent surprise attacks like the one that scaled the wall.  Although I know from my 30 years in the Army and three trips to Israel that female IDF soldiers are tough, I find it hard to accept that Segen did not go into complete shock following the traumatic amputation of her bitten-hand by Brad Pitt to avoid the spread of the contamination into the rest of her body.  Then, only four days later, she was able to conduct strenuous tactical operations in the W.H.O. facility in Wales.  HOOAH!!!How they got to that facility is also troubling.  Civilian air travel would have been shut down long ago, and I doubt that the wall around Jerusalem would have included the airport.  Surely, WWZ could have used some other aircraft than a commercial one from Belarus Airlines.  No explanation was given as to how the zombie that suddenly appeared in-flight managed to stowaway on the aircraft.  Kudos to Brad Pitt's quick action in using one of Segen's hand grenades to blow a hole in the side of the plane that sucked out the now infected zombies.  Amazingly, in the resultant crash (conveniently within walking distance of the W.H.O. facility) those two were the only survivors except for one zombie still strapped in her seat, but she does not count.  Brad Pitt is certainly one lucky puppy in that he, with virtually no formal medical training, was able to select and inject himself with the pathogen that would make him undesirable and thus virtually invisible to the zombies.The rant is almost over.  WWZ had no closure at the end other than Brad Pitt muttering some philosophical balderdash or platitudes (take your pick) about how although offensive action is now possible against the zombies it not the end, ""not even close.""  Please spare us from a sequel.Despite my pointing all of the above to her, my highly intelligent 15-year old granddaughter wants to see the movie again.

My review will hopefully help you decide if might/might not want to see this movie, it is not about fairness, it is my opinion but perhaps helpful.Fundamentally the movie could not make up its mind between gross horror flick and science fiction apocalypse of the future. Had it been one or the other then I might have liked but it didn't and I didn't like it. The movie is well done though and great special effects and decent acting but complete lack of plausibility. That is the problem, totally implausible that a virus turns humans into zombies. There has never been recorded a case of a person becoming a zombie so that is where I fault this movie. Had the victims become insane or homicidal or aggressive then the movie might have been a little more realistic. Or had it been a real horror zombie movie then that would have been ok. But it tries to make zombies a real threat to our future, ludicrous to say the least. The other problem is that our hero survives impossible situations time and time again and then saves the world. To me this movie tried to portray this viral outbreak as realistic yet goes way overboard when getting our hero through situations that are simply impossible to survive. I won't give away any parts of the movie but the last time he survives another impossible situation it was ridiculous. The other problem I have is our hero's look, long scraggly hair, beard and overall does not look like the character being portrayed.However, if you are a Brad Pitt fan then you will probably like this movie. If you believe in apocalyptic movies then you might like this movie.

It's very intense with heart-pounding suspense and chase scenes. Though, unlike other zombie movies, the focus isn't gore. Which is good as these zombies are FAST.

I think it is pretty clear that this film uses that situation to its advantage, but the similarities end there. World War Z brings to the table a few things I really enjoyed. First, these are not your typical zombies, none of that slow relentless walking, here we get zombies that are fast and agile, with relentless being the characteristic that makes the former really scary attributes. I also liked the suspense injected in the plot in terms of what is causing the zombie outbreak and how to battle it. But most of all, the cinematography is truly visually stunning. It is extremely hard to describe with words the enormity of this production, you will have to watch it to understand.The story is entertaining enough and Brad Pitt does a very good job in his role as a UN investigator that had retired but is forced to jump back into the fray to get protection for his family. There are many situations in which you will find yourself on the edge of you seat since you know a zombie will jump out soon. There are several gruesome scenes, but it being a zombie movie I assume you could have guessed that.I won't say this is my favorite movie ever, but I do think it has some qualities that make it worth watching. It is certainly different than anything else out there.

1489837,A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,B005LAIIMG,Senor Zoidbergo,"[321, 357]","The Unrated Cut runs about 7 minutes longer than the Theatrical Cut, and primarily contains additional action shots (nothing major).  Director Marc Forster has said that the Theatrical Cut IS the Director's Cut, which also unfortunately means that we will not be seeing any footage from the discarded Battle of Moscow (except for a few quick scenes in the closing montage) and the Matthew Fox subplot.The UNRATED Cut is the one to get!  It contains slightly more gore (but not gratuitously so) than the Theatrical Cut, and the action scenes are more fluid and less choppy.I've listed the primary differences between the Unrated Cut and the Theatrical Cut below.  Note, SPOILERS follow below, so read at your own risk.1) When zombies are shot/stabbed/curb stomped/etc.., they spew CG black blood.  When people are bitten, there's more CG red blood.2) During the opening scene in Philadelphia, there are more scenes of pandemonium and zombies getting shot and/or biting humans.  The segment with the red T-shirted male (""Here comes the Number 12 Train..."") being bitten and transformed into a zeke is longer and more violent.3) At the NJ Mart, when Gerry is looking for albuterol for his daughter, the camera pans down to show a dead body lying in a pool of blood, suggesting that the pharmacy employee shot him.4) The chase scene from the alleyway to the apartment is longer and more harrowing.  Gerry headshots a zombie and shoots a few others, also crushing a security guard zombie with a filing cabinet.  In the theatrical cut, this zombie chase scene is instead used during the Lanes' early morning escape to the apartment's rooftop.5) The escape scene to the apartment rooftop is now longer and more violent.  Gerry bayonets, shoots, or rifle butts many more zombies.  In a surprising twist, Tomas saves Gerry from a zeke, rather than Gerry himself shooting the zeke in the theatrical cut.  Matthew Fox's parajumper character also shoots a few more zombies and there's more zombie blood when they're shot.6) When Dr. Fassbach trips and accidentally shoots himself in the head, the wound is more graphic.  Chunks of his back skull are blown into the air and gore covers the exit ramp of the C-130.  Although this description sounds graphic, the camera cuts away quickly so that only brief glimpses of gore are seen by the audience.7) David Morse's character graphically pulls out his last remaining tooth in the Unrated Cut.  This is not shown in the Theatrical Cut.8) The Battle for Jerusalem has additional action shots.  It's now a thrilling and intense sequence in the Unrated Cut!  More IDF soldiers shooting zekes, more zekes biting people, grenades blowing up zekes, etc..9) When Gerry cuts off Segen's hand in the Unrated Cut, we see the bloody stump as well as geysers of CG blood.  This is definitely graphic and not for the faint of heart.10) The zombie attack on Belarus Airways is now more intense with passengers getting bitten left and right.  There is more CG blood too, but nothing too explicit since most of the shots are very quick.11) Gerry takes down a few zekes in the WHO facility more graphically.  He clotheslines one zeke with a crowbar and stomps on the face of another.  More CG black blood.Prior to watching World War Z, I had mixed feelings about the movie based on the trailers I had seen.

The ending on a quiet, but hopeful note was a better conclusion than the rumored Battle of Moscow.  The idea of using a temporary, but curable disease as camouflage was a unique plot point.

Brad pit is smart and measured in most everything he does, its clear he's a thinker just as soon as this show gets going it gets into a fairly smooth progression, I liked that.

I've seen some passionate zombie fans scream bloody murder if you even call a rage-diseased person a zombie. ""Zombies are only people that have died and come back to life,"" the naysayers will tell you. WWZ takes care of the issue by knocking down a human for about 12 seconds before coming back as a zombie without ever really explaining whether or not the person actually ""died"" before coming back as a fast-rage-undead-zombie. Hence undead and rage fans should equally enjoy WWZ.......Until mid-way through the movie. The first half of the move is very well done actually.

And Pitt traveling from country to country to find the source is vicious-zombie-filled and thoroughly entertaining. Then comes ""the crash.""I'm not a big fan of spoilers, so I'll just use the aforementioned ""crash"" reference to indicate the point in the movie where a jump the shark moment occurs taking the movie from believably great to unbelievably gimme-a-break territory.

1489884,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,B005LAIIMG,Steve Douglas,"[2, 4]","All my many reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the film from Standard Def DVD quality to the higher standard set for Blu Ray. Summaries of the plot and opinions of the story line and acting can be found in the majority of the other reviews so I do not want to be redundant.  In this case, I did not see World War Z in the theaters nor did I have the Standard Def version prior to buying this film on Blu Ray so the review is just about the quality of the video and audio on BR.Keep in mind, however, that the quality of what you see and hear is also dependent upon the quality of the TV monitor you are watching on as well as the home theater set up you are using. The monitor I use is a fairly new Panasonic ZT 65&#34; plasma and the amps, speakers, cables, BluRay player and Surround Processor I use are hi end esoteric gear to provide me with a more realistic and objective perspective.VIDEO....The video quality of this film varies.  All of the film is beautifully presented with deep blacks and excellent contrast.  At no point did I see any artifacting, dropouts or haloing from the many CGI effects. I also saw no banding in the many sky shots which is where banding can often be seen.  Color grading was fairly natural with excellent skin tones and slightly saturated colors.  The color grading did vary from cool for the night shots to an overly warm grading during the scenes in Israel.  For many films shot in the mid East, the editors produce an overly golden color correction.  Not sure why this is as that is not the what you actually see when in the mid East. Maybe they think that the desert is always of a golden color.  The mass rush of CGI zombies goes so quickly in its many scenes of this type that the zombies themselves are often a blur of movement rather than a detailed depiction of each zombie running by.  This blur obviously causes a loss of detail.  Details for the real actors and actresses however are sharp and defined even in the shadow areas.  The average Mbps rate appeared to be in the mid 30's and, overall, the quality of the extended version on Blu Ray was really very good.AUDIO...I love that there is a 7.1 lossless DTS HD MA audio mix which the film defaults to. If your system is still a 5.1 system, not to fret, the additional 6th and 7th channels will be muxed to feed into your 4th and 5th rear channels without any issues.  The lossless audio codec provides clear and transparent dialogue and the audio levels are set so that foley fx does not step on the dialogue.  Once you set your volume control you will not need to go back to it to readjust for roller coasting audio.  I did watch this film on a 7.1 system and there is excellent use of all channels for panning between the left and right and front and back audio stages.  The 6th and 7th channels are not given specific foley sounds to reproduce but add a more expansive and immersive theater experience creating a wide field of ambient sound.  Discreet directionality between the channels is more often than not used for larger audio occurrences rather than a cup falling to the floor on the right stage.  In other words, not too much small foley fx but more for larger crowd and helicopter type foleys.  There are a couple of scenes that produce some of the deepest bottom end for your LFE channel that I have ever heard and your sub will get plenty to do throughout the film.  5 stars for the audioEXTRAS....The one clearly negative thing about this Blu Ray is that there are 3 previews of other films. You are paying for their advertising which takes up room on the Blu Ray calling for even more video compression in order to fit it all in. Who wants to pay for an advertisement ? Not me, I'd rather have an improved video transfer with less compression.Other than that, this Blu Ray has plenty of excellent extras.  Often I find the 'Making of ' documentaries to be rather boring but this multi part documentary on the writing of the script, the creation of the CGI work, Stunts and more was really very interesting and included brief and on going narratives with the writers, actors and producers.  Also included is a small section on the scientific basis for zombism and it symbolism in the real world.  There is no on going commentary while the film is playing.The Digital copy offers 2 choices between downloading to iTunes which I am doing as I am writing this and Ultra Violet which I have never liked.  First I went to the UV address and entered my code, email address and password..all properly...UV said my email address was not valid, weird since that is the only one I ever had.  Just don't care for UV.  I had no problems at all putting in my Digital copy of the film and redeeming it on iTunes.I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase. All of my reviews are of this nature and I hope they can be of HELP to you as well.Thanks for reading.",4,World War Z on Blu Ray +DVD+Digital Copy,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,4987,"['many',

Note the book is called World War Z not Brad Pitt's Zombie movie.  It really is Brad Pitt's Zombie movie and unless they actually complete a sequel and have at least one scene from the book they should just abandon the whole World War Z premise altogether.  Having said all that I loved this movie.  I saw the rated cut version in the theatre and enjoyed it as well as it was completely new material bearing absolutely no relationship to the book I had just read.  Now it's been months since I've seen that theatrical release but if my memory is correct, and it probably isn't, I don't recall the final few minutes being in the original.  Those minutes showing the battle in Moscow.  Those who read the book know what I mean.  And that was a nod to the book and a promise to create a sequel which may, if it's a trilogy, make what they did in this novel perfectly appropriate in its vision.  I love me some zombies and this franchise is a totally different take on the genre.  The rule of thumb in the genre is that humans lose.  They spend the movie trying to survive only to find out survival is impossible.  In World War Z the message is the opposite.  We are nearly defeated but like in Independence Day we ultimately survive.  How this franchise gets us there will ultimately determine whether it's World War Z or Brad Pitt's Zombie Trilogy.Now that we went there, for fans of the genre, wasn't it just a bit of stolen thunder that the director chose Philadelphia as the place from which the story begins (sorry directors, I95 has never been that empty of traffic) considering Justin Cronin's &#34;Passage&#34; Trilogy is slated for filming and one of the best, most important, scenes in the Passage is the outbreak in Philly.

The incubation period is 12 seconds, yet somehow the infection was able to be transmitted by airplane to the entire world. I am still scratching my head on that one.Brad Pitt,who is now a family man, must save the world to save his family. There is some background noise that would indicate the zombie outbreak might be caused by how man destroys the environment and ignores the signs (global warming, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.) The world is thrust into anarchy, while the military exists.Brad must look for the original virus somewhere in the world to find a cure. We discover N.Korea is unaffected because they pulled everyone's teeth. Israel is unaffected because they have a great wall around their country, but apparently cold isolated places like Greenland are infected.

Oh yes, if you have a lot of people on a ship, they share beds and sleep in shifts.I enjoyed the film more as a pandemic film than a foot dragging, flesh eating, living dead, rotting zombie film, because that is what it was. I would say if you don't like Brad Pitt, don't see this film. There is very little screen time that doesn't show his face.

The first act, usually the first half hour is generally where the conflict is introduced. This film opens with Gerry Lee, Brad Pitt, a former UN investigator having breakfast with his family. Five minutes later, BAM, zombies. No time is wasted getting straight to the conflict. Begin second act.The story is not complicated: zombies take over the world and Brad Pitt is obliged to save the day. The assault of zombie movies over the past few years has been such an onslaught that by default the genre itself now gives me an automatic feeling of &#8220;I don&#8217;t care.&#8221; World War Z is very much another zombie film, but a damn exciting one. Even the script&#8217;s description for becoming a zombie, turning Zeke, is subtlety refreshing.&#8220;It&#8217;s not what you say but how you say it.&#8221; With cinematic excellence, Director Marc Forster breaths new live into this tired clich&eacute;. It&#8217;s all in the delivery, and WWZ definitely delivers.As Gerry Lee (Pitt) travels the world trying to solve the mystery behind the infection causing people to turn &#8220;Zeke,&#8221; the scenes that unfold during his expedition are so exciting that story arc is incidental in comparison. A memorable scene is when a military commander becomes infected. He&#8217;s got about ten seconds: &#8220;I&#8217;m a goddamn Zeke&#8230;I got this one boys.&#8221; Then, he puts a bullet in this own head.The exotic set designs of the adventurous locales are the highlights of the film. First an adrenaline pumped escape from an infested Philadelphian housing project, then to a US navy ship at sea, then over to a US military base in Korea where a massive fire fight breaks out. Next Lee arrives in Israel where the citizens have protected themselves against the Zekes in a totally ingenious, but vulnerable walled up construction. The set design here is just incredible and when the situation goes awry, and things start blowing up, the visual effects are some of the best around, bar none.Errata: Brad Pitt picks up an Israel solider sidekick along the way. They are both the sole survivors of a horrific plane crash. How convenient.In 28 Days Later a single drop of infected blood causes a subject to turn into a zombie. In WWZ Brad Pitt gets Zeke blood in his mouth and doesn&#8217;t turn. This fact is acknowledged early in the film so we know this fact for the remainder of it. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be a single, recognized method of contracting zombieism.Interestingly there is a real drug called Tetrodoxin that is supposedly the closest thing to an actual zombie-causing agent in existence.Get more at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com",4,"Great, Fresh take on a tired Genre",1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,2714,"['World', 'War', 'Z', 'must', 'have', 'one', 'shortest', 'first', 'acts', 'film', 'history', 'first', 'act', 'usually', 'first', 'hour', 'generally', 'where', 'conflict', 'introduced', 'film', 'Gerry', 'Lee', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'former', 'UN', 'investigator', 'having', 'breakfast', 'family', 'Five', 'minutes', 'later', 'BAM', 'zombies', 'time', 'wasted', 'getting', 'straight', 'conflict', 'Begin', 'second', 'act.The', 'story', 'not', 'complicated', 'zombies', 'take', 'world', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'obliged', 'save', 'day', 'assault', 'zombie', 'movies', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'been', 'onslaught', 'default', 'genre', 'now', 'automatic', 'feeling', '8220', 'don', '8217', 'care.', '8221', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'very', 'much', 'zombie', 'film', 'damn', 'exciting', 'one', 'Even', 'script', '8217', 'description', 'becoming', 'zombie', 'turning', 'Zeke', 'subtlety', 'refreshing.', '8220', '8217', 'not', 'what', 'say', 'how', 'say', 'it.', '8221', 'cinematic', 'excellence', 'Director', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'breaths', 'new', 'live', 'tired', 'clich', 'eacute', '8217', 's', 'delivery', 'WWZ', 'definitely', 'Gerry', 'Lee', 'Pitt', 'world', 'trying', 'solve', 'mystery', 'infection', 'causing', 'people', 'turn', '8220', 'Zeke', '8221', 'scenes', 'unfold', 'expedition', 'are', 'so', 'exciting', 'story', 'arc', 'incidental', 'comparison', 'memorable', 'scene', 'when', 'military', 'commander', 'becomes', 'infected', '8217', 'got', 'about', 'ten', 'seconds', '8220', '8217', 'goddamn', 'Zeke', '8230', 'got', 'one', 'boys.', '8221', 'Then', 'bullet', 'own', 'head.The', 'exotic', 'set', 'designs', 'adventurous', 'locales', 'are', 'highlights', 'film', 'First', 'adrenaline', 'pumped', 'escape', 'infested', 'Philadelphian', 'housing', 'project', 'then', 'US', 'navy', 'ship', 'sea', 'then', 'US', 'military', 'base', 'Korea', 'where', 'massive', 'fire', 'fight', 'out', 'Next', 'Lee', 'Israel', 'where', 'citizens', 'have', 'protected', 'Zekes', 'totally', 'ingenious', 'vulnerable', 'walled', 'up', 'construction', 'set', 'design', 'here', 'just', 'incredible', 'when', 'situation', 'awry', 'things', 'start', 'blowing', 'up', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'best', 'around', 'bar', 'none.Errata', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'up', 'Israel', 'solider', 'sidekick', 'way', 'are', 'sole', 'survivors', 'horrific', 'plane', 'crash', 'How', 'convenient.In', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'single', 'drop', 'infected', 'blood', 'subject', 'turn', 'zombie', 'WWZ', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Zeke', 'blood', 'mouth', 'doesn', '8217', 'turn', 'fact', 'acknowledged', 'early', 'film', 'know', 'fact', 'remainder', 'doesn', '8217', 'seem', 'be', 'single', 'recognized', 'method', 'contracting', 'zombieism.Interestingly', 'real', 'drug', 'called', 'Tetrodoxin', 'supposedly', 'closest', 'thing', 'actual', 'zombie-causing', 'agent', 'existence.Get', 'more', 'getthebonesaw.blogspot.com']",World War Z

1489955,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B005LAIIMG,titania86,"[0, 1]","**spoilers**First, this film bears absolutely no resemblance to the book of the same name. The only thing they have in common is the existence of zombies, the title, and the worldwide scale. This film could only be remotely like the book if it were told in a documentary style with interviews of the various people. This film is basically Brad Pitt (Gerry) goes around the world kicking zombie butt and looking for a cure for the zombie plague. In order to review it more objectively, I am going to pretend the movie isn't called World War Z and put aside all my expectations and hopes based on that title.World War Z is an interesting film that brings up concepts I haven't seen before in zombie films. There aren't many that focus on what the government does during such a situation. Gerry used to work for the UN and he is basically told to help them find a cure or his family can't stay in the safe housing anymore. He flies all over the world chasing the origin of the disease and narrowly escaping death at each locale. The suspense is well done and builds in the right places. My favorite scenes were the zombies in the airplane and the claustrophobic journey through the WHO lab. The zombies are frightening and super fast. The solution at the end is temporary, but effective. Gerry notices certain people just don't exist to the zombies. He theorizes that those people survived a deadly disease and thus are an nonviable host for the zombie virus. This is proven true when he injects himself with a random disease in order to go bypass the zombies and return to his team with the diseases to test the theory. The film ends with a vaccine being made of a lethal pathogen to render the general public invisible to zombies. It isn't perfect and it isn't the end, but it's a good place to start. I like that all the ends aren't tied up with a nice bow. The theory makes sense and isn't something I've seen before.The film has a lot of flaws. I've ranted about it before, but I really don't like fast zombies. It doesn't make biological sense for their muscles and tendons to be magically invincible and able to take the stress over long periods of time. World War Z takes it a step further and makes them swarm in an insectile way using bad, cartoony CGI. It just looked horrible and made me roll my eyes. The film is PG-13, so although there are numerous zombie attacks, there is very little blood and gore. I'm not just being a gorehound here. It's a realistic part of being in a zombie apocalypse: people are torn apart and eaten everywhere. I felt like I was watching a watered down or censored zombie film. The zombie virus takes hold quite fast. There really isn't enough time for a person to board a plane and go somewhere else to spread that the disease. It just doesn't work in the scope of the narrative. The characters were less than compelling. Gerry only agrees to help save humanity because his incredibly generic family is threatened. I'm not sure if he thought that through, but his family is included in all of humanity. The situation with his family also makes the film just like every other disaster movie ever. It was frustrating in a lot of ways. It just goes to show that being the most expensive zombie film ever made does not make automatically it a good film.Overall, the film was ok: nothing spectacular and definitely does not live up to the hype. The novel is clearly superior on all possible levels. I would watch the sequel to see where it goes next, but I don't anticipate greatness.",3,Ok film if you forget the amazing book it was based on,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,3519,"['**spoilers**First', 'film', 'absolutely', 'resemblance', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'common', 'existence', 'zombies', 'title', 'worldwide', 'scale', 'film', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'remotely', 'book', 'were', 'told', 'documentary', 'style', 'interviews', 'various', 'people', 'film', 'basically', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Gerry', 'world', 'kicking', 'zombie', 'butt', 'looking', 'cure', 'zombie', 'plague', 'order', 'review', 'more', 'objectively', 'am', 'going', 'pretend', 'movie', ""n't"", 'called', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'put', 'aside', 'expectations', 'hopes', 'based', 'title.World', 'War', 'Z', 'interesting', 'film', 'up', 'concepts', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'zombie', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'focus', 'what', 'government', 'situation', 'Gerry', 'used', 'work', 'UN', 'basically', 'told', 'help', 'find', 'cure', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'safe', 'housing', 'anymore', 'world', 'chasing', 'origin', 'disease', 'narrowly', 'escaping', 'death', 'locale', 'suspense', 'well', 'done', 'builds', 'right', 'places', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'were', 'zombies', 'airplane', 'claustrophobic', 'journey', 'WHO', 'lab', 'zombies', 'are', 'frightening', 'super', 'fast', 'solution', 'end', 'temporary', 'effective', 'Gerry', 'certain', 'people', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'zombies', 'people', 'survived', 'deadly', 'disease', 'thus', 'are', 'nonviable', 'host', 'zombie', 'virus', 'proven', 'true', 'when', 'random', 'disease', 'order', 'go', 'bypass', 'zombies', 'return', 'team', 'diseases', 'test', 'theory', 'film', 'vaccine', 'being', 'made', 'lethal', 'pathogen', 'render', 'general', 'public', 'invisible', 'zombies', ""n't"", 'perfect', ""n't"", 'end', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'like', 'ends', 'are', ""n't"", 'tied', 'up', 'nice', 'bow', 'theory', 'sense', ""n't"", 'something', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before.The', 'film', 'lot', 'flaws', ""'ve"", 'ranted', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fast', 'zombies', ""n't"", 'make', 'biological', 'sense', 'muscles', 'tendons', 'be', 'magically', 'invincible', 'able', 'take', 'stress', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'step', 'further', 'swarm', 'insectile', 'way', 'using', 'bad', 'cartoony', 'CGI', 'just', 'looked', 'horrible', 'made', 'roll', 'eyes', 'film', 'PG-13', 'so', 'are', 'numerous', 'zombie', 'attacks', 'very', 'little', 'blood', 'gore', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'being', 'gorehound', 'here', 'realistic', 'part', 'being', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'people', 'are', 'torn', 'apart', 'eaten', 'everywhere', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'watered', 'down', 'censored', 'zombie', 'film', 'zombie', 'virus', 'hold', 'quite', 'fast', 'really', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'person', 'board', 'plane', 'go', 'somewhere', 'else', 'spread', 'disease', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'scope', 'narrative', 'characters', 'were', 'less', 'compelling', 'Gerry', 'only', 'help', 'save', 'humanity', 'incredibly', 'generic', 'family', 'threatened', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'thought', 'family', 'included', 'humanity', 'situation', 'family', 'also', 'film', 'just', 'other', 'disaster', 'movie', 'ever', 'was', 'frustrating', 'lot', 'ways', 'just', 'show', 'being', 'most', 'expensive', 'zombie', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'not', 'make', 'automatically', 'good', 'film.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'ok', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'definitely', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'novel', 'clearly', 'superior', 'possible', 'levels', 'would', 'watch', 'sequel', 'see', 'where', 'next', 'do', ""n't"", 'anticipate', 'greatness']",World War Z

It was destine to become a movie, especially now, with the popularity of zombies, but ultimately, the highly anticipated film fails to deliver anything different. U.N. Employee, Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), is out with his family when a recently discovered virus hits the United States and all hell breaks loose. The first 45 minutes of this film were literally like the pilot of The Walking Dead. No one knows what's going on, people are panicking, it was all very predictable. The film does go into a different direction after that, but how many different ways of doing a zombie film are there? Lane starts traveling the world seeking a cure for the disease, while at the same time trying to avoid being attacked. The unfortunate fact is that no matter how good the acting or the writing, there is very little you can actually do with a zombie film. The zombies and the circumstances behind the outbreak are always a little different, but ultimately it becomes about survival or the race to find a cure. Brad Pitt is terrific, and as I have been saying for year, it doesn't matter how good looking the guy is, he belongs in action films! This is the genre where he excels and even though World War Z was painfully predictable, Pitt makes it worth watching. He is the focus of the story and it takes a lot of quick thinking and tremendous stunts to keep him alive. For me that was the best part of the film. There was a lot of hype behind World War Z and it was a very intense film, but like I said, there is very little you can do with an end of the world/zombie film that hasn't been done over and over again.

A few notable variations...(Possibly a spoiler alert or two here...)The movie doesn't rely on trying to out-gross other zombie films. (At least in the rated version) No graphic depictions of brains being splattered, etc. Instead it relies on the story to carry it through.The climax isn't a final, bloody battle to the death (Or undeath as the case may be).

1489973,AQSMM1Z9BEOYT,B005LAIIMG,Toorop,"[3, 8]","I saw this film opening weekend and I left the theatre thinking ""WOW!"". And while normally that would mean awesome it this time meant they screwed up some things. Now before I begin reviewing the film I must state and caution readers I HAVE NOT read the book nor will I (not into novels). Having said that I do love zombies and I do enjoy some of Pitt's vehicles this being one. Now the first thing I find very annoying is the rating. Yes it had around a $200M budget but to me that is not to say it wouldn't have done well at the box office had it been rated R. When a zombie bites someone blood SHOULD be shown and when you see a reanimated corpse running well it should be a bit more scary. The thrills that led this film should have been replaced with suspense. Pitt did an alright job but for a guy who pretty much got this project off the ground well I would have thought his performance would have been more emotional now this isn't to say he was by any means bad but he was a bit disappointing for me. As for the overall tone of the film it was mixed as I previously noted thrills should have been suspense and there should have been some gore (by no means am I saying it should have been an NC-17 movie) and a lot more scares.Now you know where I stand I would like to point out that I am still excited to see this film by seeing the Unrated version in hopes that some of the things that disappointed me will be fixed and I can bump up the rating of this movie at least a half star. In closing if you ONLY want a shoot em', thrill ride zombie flick with pretty good storytelling this film is for you. However if you love Zombies and want a true adaptation (again I haven't read the book but many have expressed that it isn't loyal to the novel) that is gory and scary well this probably isn't for you....yet! There is still hope as I have mentioned...with an unrated cut we hardcore zombie fans might be able to say this is fun and scary not just fun. Until then I will just watch Dawn Of The Dead. Though I hope to add this to my collection very soon. Lastly it is also worth noting this film made some profit (500M+ Worldwide at the box office) so with a sequel or sequels we could very well get a better zombie flick out of Pitt and crew.",3,Had potential and perhaps still does with the unrated version!,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",2013,2250,"['saw', 'film', 'opening', 'weekend', 'left', 'theatre', 'thinking', 'WOW', 'normally', 'would', 'mean', 'awesome', 'time', 'meant', 'screwed', 'up', 'things', 'Now', 'begin', 'reviewing', 'film', 'must', 'state', 'caution', 'readers', 'HAVE', 'NOT', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'not', 'novels', 'Having', 'said', 'do', 'love', 'zombies', 'do', 'enjoy', 'Pitt', 'vehicles', 'being', 'one', 'Now', 'first', 'thing', 'find', 'very', 'annoying', 'rating', 'Yes', 'had', '200M', 'budget', 'not', 'say', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'had', 'been', 'rated', 'R.', 'When', 'zombie', 'someone', 'blood', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'shown', 'when', 'see', 'reanimated', 'corpse', 'running', 'well', 'should', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'scary', 'thrills', 'led', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'suspense', 'Pitt', 'did', 'alright', 'job', 'guy', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'got', 'project', 'ground', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'performance', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'emotional', 'now', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'means', 'bad', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointing', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'was', 'mixed', 'previously', 'noted', 'thrills', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'suspense', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'gore', 'means', 'am', 'saying', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'NC-17', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'scares.Now', 'know', 'where', 'stand', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'am', 'still', 'excited', 'see', 'film', 'seeing', 'Unrated', 'version', 'hopes', 'things', 'disappointed', 'will', 'be', 'fixed', 'can', 'bump', 'up', 'rating', 'movie', 'least', 'half', 'star', 'closing', 'ONLY', 'want', 'shoot', 'em', 'thrill', 'ride', 'zombie', 'flick', 'pretty', 'good', 'storytelling', 'film', 'However', 'love', 'Zombies', 'want', 'true', 'adaptation', 'again', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'many', 'have', 'expressed', ""n't"", 'loyal', 'novel', 'gory', 'scary', 'well', 'probably', ""n't"", '.yet', 'still', 'hope', 'have', 'mentioned', 'unrated', 'cut', 'hardcore', 'zombie', 'fans', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'say', 'fun', 'scary', 'not', 'just', 'fun', 'then', 'will', 'just', 'watch', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'hope', 'add', 'collection', 'very', 'soon', 'Lastly', 'also', 'worth', 'noting', 'film', 'made', 'profit', '500M+', 'Worldwide', 'box', 'office', 'so', 'sequel', 'sequels', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'get', 'better', 'zombie', 'flick', 'Pitt', 'crew']",World War Z

The answer is ""World War Z"" starring Brad Pitt as a former UN investigator trying to find a way to save his family and the world, too. This is a zombie movie without gore and flesh-eating. You may call it the world's least gory zombie movie, or the most family-friendly zombie picture.I haven't read the original book by Max Brooks, but I imagine the source material is pretty different from what I saw on screen. The film is filled with choppily edited action set-pieces involving cars, helicopters and an airplane, that are decent but not special. Anyone who has seen ""Quantum of Solace"" knows that Marc Forster, who did a great job in ""Finding Neverland,"" is not the right choice for directing action scenes.Anyway, it is obvious that Forster attempts to turn the familiar zombie movie conventions into something different with social and political commentaries (the high walls in Israel in the mid-section action sequence is a good example). Unfortunately, his attempts to address deeper issues are at best feeble, easily overshadowed by CGI-enhanced action scenes that are fun to watch, but ultimately forgettable.And action scenes. Swarms of zombies running wild in the streets or climbing up the wall are at first impressive, but then become a bit dull. Some scenes are physically too incredible, even by the standards of mindless entertainment, undermining whatever serious subtexts (if any) you may read in the apocalyptic tale.In short, ""World War Z"" is a new spin on a zombie genre - a summer blockbuster zombie movie, which means, ironically, a zombie movie that doesn't bite.

It isn't hunger since they don't eat anyone. It doesn't seem to be general anger and rage as other than biteing, they are essentially non destructive to other animals or the physical world around them. Big question: Why do they bite everyone? What is their motivation? As they are mindless - it isn't to keep propogating the infection (they aren't thinking that deeply). I wish that question had been answered. Question 2, as they are dead, why don't they decompose?

1490027,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B005LAIIMG,Wayne C. Rogers,"[0, 0]","I never read the novel, World War Z, by Max Brooks.  Brad Pitt, however, must be a zombie fan because he bought the movie rights in 2007, which was way before The Walking Dead appeared on AMC television.  It took Pitt five years to make the film at a cost of $190 million dollars.  The movie has internationally grossed over $540 million.  It broke even.  It didn&#8217;t make a profit.  A film supposedly has to make three times its cost to break even, which is divided amongst the studios, the distributors and the theater chains.Now, because I was unable to see the Blu-Ray edition, which was the extended version of the film with a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff on it, I had to settle for the theatrical version on a regular DVD.  Surprisingly, considering all the negative reviews, I actually found the movie to be understandable and very entertaining.  In fact, I was glued to the television set for the entire length of the film.  For me, Brad Pitt is now the king of zombie movies.The film pretty much starts right into the action with Pitt (an ex-United Nations investigator) and his family getting caught in a traffic jam in the city of Philadelphia.  The zombie epidemic has already spread from Europe to the United States with blinding-like speed (in fact it only takes twelve seconds for a dead person to change into a killing zombie).  Brad&#8217;s character, Gerry Lane, calls his friend at the United Nations so he and his family can be air-lifted out of the city.  This does happen, but only after being chased by a horde of zombies to a roof top in downtown Philly.  The catch, however, is that If Brad wants his family to be protected, he has to do what the military tells him, which is to fly into Russia and try to find a cure for the decease.  This is the rest of the movie.  Pitt flies to Soviet Union and then to Israel and then to an outpost where the most infamous deceases known to mankind are studied.Is a cure eventually found for the humans still alive?  You have to see the movie, but a sequel is already in the works.Let me tell you that these zombies aren&#8217;t slow walkers.  These handsome fellows can move fast and they take no prisoners.  The special effects of the movie are awesome in my opinion as thousands of zombies pile on top of each other to climb over the wall surrounding Jerusalem.  Remember, zombies can&#8217;t be killed, unless you shoot them in the head.I certainly enjoyed the pacing of the movie.  It didn&#8217;t really give you time to think, but I liked what Brad Pitt&#8217;s character was able to discover and the shootouts with the zombies.  A female Israeli commando is bitten in the arm, and Brad cuts the arm off without any hesitation, leaving her alive, but with a stub.  Fortunately, this woman is one tough cookie and can shoot with accurately with just one arm.Being a big fan of the early George Romero zombie movies and The Walking Dead television series, I found myself impressed with this film and Brad Pitt&#8217;s acting.  The whole movie more or less is on his shoulders, and he carries the weight without any problems, displaying his ultimate skills as a truly excellent actor.  He makes this movie happen, and you believe in him and his love for his family.  Mireille Enos (she stars in the TV series, The Killing) is the perfect actress for his wife in the movie.  If Angelina Jolie had been in it, you would have expected her to go after the zombies and kick some real butt.  Not so with Mireille.  She&#8217;s the perfect mother hen who watches out for her children, praying her husband will return alive to protect them.I can&#8217;t comment on the extended version of the film on Blu-Ray, or the extras that are on the disc.  I do want to see them, but I need to get a Blu-Ray television for that.All in all, I was surprised at how much I loved this movie.  I want to watch it again and see if I feel the same way.  Other people have told me that I&#8217;m crazy; but hey, the movie did make over 500 million at the Box Office, so somebody must have liked it besides me.",5,"For me, this was a great zombie film!",1399161600,"05 4, 2014",2014,4056,"['never', 'read', 'novel', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'Max', 'Brooks', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'however', 'must', 'be', 'zombie', 'fan', 'bought', 'movie', 'rights', '2007', 'was', 'way', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'appeared', 'AMC', 'television', 'took', 'Pitt', 'five', 'years', 'make', 'film', 'cost', '190', 'million', 'dollars', 'movie', 'internationally', 'grossed', '540', 'million', 'broke', 'even', '8217', 't', 'make', 'profit', 'film', 'supposedly', 'make', 'three', 'times', 'cost', 'break', 'even', 'divided', 'studios', 'distributors', 'theater', 'chains.Now', 'was', 'unable', 'see', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'was', 'extended', 'version', 'film', 'lot', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stuff', 'had', 'settle', 'theatrical', 'version', 'regular', 'DVD', 'Surprisingly', 'considering', 'negative', 'reviews', 'actually', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'understandable', 'very', 'entertaining', 'fact', 'was', 'glued', 'television', 'set', 'entire', 'length', 'film', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'now', 'king', 'zombie', 'movies.The', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'starts', 'right', 'action', 'Pitt', 'ex-United', 'Nations', 'investigator', 'family', 'getting', 'caught', 'traffic', 'jam', 'city', 'Philadelphia', 'zombie', 'epidemic', 'already', 'spread', 'Europe', 'United', 'States', 'blinding-like', 'speed', 'fact', 'only', 'twelve', 'seconds', 'dead', 'person', 'change', 'killing', 'zombie', 'Brad', '8217', 's', 'character', 'Gerry', 'Lane', 'friend', 'United', 'Nations', 'so', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'air-lifted', 'city', 'happen', 'only', 'being', 'chased', 'horde', 'zombies', 'roof', 'top', 'downtown', 'Philly', 'catch', 'however', 'Brad', 'family', 'be', 'protected', 'do', 'what', 'military', 'tells', 'fly', 'Russia', 'try', 'find', 'cure', 'decease', 'rest', 'movie', 'Pitt', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'then', 'Israel', 'then', 'outpost', 'where', 'most', 'infamous', 'deceases', 'known', 'mankind', 'are', 'studied.Is', 'cure', 'eventually', 'found', 'humans', 'still', 'alive', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'sequel', 'already', 'works.Let', 'tell', 'zombies', 'aren', '8217', 'slow', 'walkers', 'handsome', 'fellows', 'can', 'move', 'fast', 'take', 'prisoners', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'awesome', 'opinion', 'thousands', 'zombies', 'pile', 'top', 'other', 'climb', 'wall', 'surrounding', 'Jerusalem', 'Remember', 'zombies', 'can', '8217', 'be', 'killed', 'shoot', 'head.I', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'pacing', 'movie', '8217', 'really', 'give', 'time', 'think', 'liked', 'what', 'Brad', 'Pitt', '8217', 's', 'character', 'was', 'able', 'discover', 'shootouts', 'zombies', 'female', 'Israeli', 'commando', 'bitten', 'arm', 'Brad', 'arm', 'hesitation', 'leaving', 'alive', 'stub', 'Fortunately', 'woman', 'one', 'tough', 'cookie', 'can', 'shoot', 'accurately', 'just', 'one', 'arm.Being', 'big', 'fan', 'early', 'George', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'movies', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'television', 'series', 'found', 'impressed', 'film', 'Brad', 'Pitt', '8217', 'acting', 'whole', 'movie', 'more', 'less', 'shoulders', 'weight', 'problems', 'displaying', 'ultimate', 'skills', 'truly', 'excellent', 'actor', 'movie', 'happen', 'believe', 'love', 'family', 'Mireille', 'Enos', 'TV', 'series', 'Killing', 'perfect', 'actress', 'wife', 'movie', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'had', 'been', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'go', 'zombies', 'kick', 'real', 'butt', 'Not', 'so', 'Mireille', '8217', 's', 'perfect', 'mother', 'hen', 'who', 'out', 'children', 'praying', 'husband', 'will', 'return', 'alive', 'protect', 'them.I', 'can', '8217', 't', 'comment', 'extended', 'version', 'film', 'Blu-Ray', 'extras', 'are', 'disc', 'do', 'want', 'see', 'need', 'get', 'Blu-Ray', 'television', 'that.All', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'movie', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'see', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'Other', 'people', 'have', 'told', '8217', 'crazy', 'hey', 'movie', 'did', 'make', '500', 'million', 'Box', 'Office', 'somebody', 'must', 'have', 'liked']",World War Z

World War Z definitely has it's moments.  There are also a few other elements of Z that make it stand out from the crowd of ubiquitous zombie movies.  Is it the ultimate zombie movie?  I'll leave that for others to decide, but I personally have to say, I don't think so.  Is it entertaining?  Absolutely.  The zombies in Z are often truly frightening in the way they move and act and charge en masse.  There are also, as is normally the case with zombie movies, huge plot holes and logical problems that go unanswered, but this is probably to be expected.  After all, who wants to watch an analytical zombie movie where everything is explained in minute detail?  Who gives a rip?  We go to zombie movies for the gore and the spectacle and the inevitable hero, which, true to form, Brad Pitt does very well.  The &#34;final solution&#34; in Z, while unique compared to other zombie movies, is also somewhat lame, but, in the end, you have to have SOME way of dealing these nasty critters.  So you must simply go with the flow.Having said all of these mostly positive things about it, I did find that the World of Z lacks a certain &#34;charm&#34; (if that is the appropriate word) of some of the earlier zombie films, particularly those of George Romero (with Dawn of the Dead being, perhaps, my favorite). There is little or no fun in Z here.  It is a considerably different experience here.  This is not a film you can smugly chuckle at as you watch it.  It is far too serious for that.  When all is said and done, I liked the World of Z and can recommend it to those of you who enjoy this kind of movie.  I would definitely not recommend this flick for young kids; you stand a very good chance of giving them nightmares for some some time to come.

But this movie gave me none. In my opinion, someone floated the idea of zombies who can out run an Olympic 100 yard sprinter. Okay, that's okay. But usually zombies are slow menacing things with gruesome bodies and faces. What I am getting at is that the zombies of WWZ were a blur. I know this will sound odd, but they had no character. Except for one or two faces shown up close, the rest were running so fast became cyphers, nothing. In the very last fourth of the movie they take on some slow moving qualities, especially when Pitt has to get something from a laboratory.

1490061,A24JDJQWQDDH14,B005LAIIMG,Yu Narukami,"[0, 0]","Vultures have been circling the lumbering mega-budget production of World War Z almost since the film went into pre-production. First, fans of Max Brook's highly-regarded novel were up in arms when it emerged that the book's multiplicity of survivors' tales was to be distilled into a star vehicle for Pitt. Then news leaked of multiple drafts from various writers being rejected (the film has writing credits for four different scribes). Early trailers were ill received. It emerged that the entire last act of the film (an epic battle sequence) had been junked and fanboy kryptonite Lindelof brought in to write an entirely new ending.With the mood on the blogosphere toxic, the trades and mainstream press piled in as the smell of blood in the water grew stronger. Paramount eventually stopped even pretending the film was not troubled, allowing Vanity Fair to publish an astonishing account of the difficult production - further increasing speculation that this was a $200 million dollar plus vanity project for Pitt and his production company, Plan B.Now World War Z has finally arrived,and if the narrative behind its making is as compelling as that of any of 2013's blockbusters, the unexpected twist ending is the year's most shocking. Spoiler... the movie is good. In fact, it's not just good - it's great.Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former investigator for the United Nations living with his family in cheerfully chaotic domestic bliss, economically sketched out in an opening breakfast scene that is almost the only moment of calm for the next 100-odd minutes - save that the TV in the kitchen is running disturbing news footage of social disorder breaking out in locations across the world. Driving his family into the city, Gerry gets stuck in traffic gridlock and BOOM! All hell breaks loose as the whole world goes to s***in what seems like five minutes flat and director Forster slams the pedal to the metal for the first of many stunning action sequences.The subsequent globe-trotting story has Lane is drafted back into service for the United Nations to search for the source of the ""zombie"" plague that within days has brought the world to the brink of apocalypse. The pace is blistering, honestly comparable to Gareth Evans' The Raid, and the scale is as epic as hundreds of millions of dollars can provide. What makes World War Z really work is humanity of its characters. Pitt himself is at the heart of this. To make a film like this commercially viable, it had to have a major star. But Lane is no superman (or Superman). He isn't James Bond, Jason Bourne or Ethan Hunt - in fact, he spends most of the film running away from stuff. Pitt really sells the notion that Lane is a common man in extraordinarily uncommon circumstances, motivated by love of his family to put himself ridiculously in harm's way. I struggle to come up with another male star of his stature that could have pulled this part off.Pitt is in every scene, but around him are a rapidly-changing collection of characters who join only for sections of the narrative. However by canny international casting characters who often have mere minutes of screen time register memorably. Especially good are Enos (from TV's Big Love and the US version of The Killing) as Lane's wife, and Israeli actress Daniella Kertesz (in a nearly dialogue free role). Nowhere is it more clear that the film has been substantially shaped in the editing room, than from the fact that the highly-billed Fox is essentially a blink-and-you'll-miss-him featured extra. Before remarking on Forster's skills remember that when Terrence Malick does this, he's called a genius.Where the film really scores is that despite the fact that it is a ""zombie"" movie (and unusually one where the reason characters use that term is because they have seen zombie movies), the environments and human characters feel real and convincing. The action has a gritty verite feel while never being less than spectacular. While the threat is fantastical, like Romero's best zombie films World War Z takes place in a convincing world - in this case a distinctly post 9/11 one. One sequence in particular is sure to inspire debate over the presence or not of a geo-political subtext, but I'll leave that for you to discover.World War Z is also often very frightening; despite the lack of gore, this is an extremely intense film and one which parents should be very careful about bringing children to. At the time of writing no BBFC certificate had been announced, but it has received a PG-13 in the US - meaning a 12A is quite possible. This is absolutely not a movie for under-12s, and if you take them, prepare for sleepless nights.The breakneck pace and sheer shock-and-awe of the film's scale paper over a few cracks. What exactly makes Pitt's character the UN's go-to guy is never exactly made clear, and some of the plot mechanics that propel the story from one part of the globe to the next don't quite hold up to intense scrutiny. However, in my view, one would really have to be committed to not having a good time to find these elements overly troubling. This is widescreen filmmaking at its best.World War Z is a compelling reminder that for every troubled production that produces a Bonfire of the Vanities or Island of Dr. Moreau, there is Casablanca, Apocalypse Now, or Blade Runner. I'm not putting WWZ quite in that category - only time will tell - but against all the odds, this is the best blockbuster yet seen in the 2013.",5,This is the end!,1371081600,"06 13,

Here's the thing: Pitt was the wrong guy to be cast as the lead, in my opinion.  Not because he is not CAPABLE, but because he failed to show any emotion in this flick.  Why?  I have no idea.  The movie provides a few truly frightening scenarios, yet Pitt has that blank stare on his face.  His character is witnessing things that really are thrillingly frightening!  You, the viewer, will be scared.  Pitt?  Blank too-much-Xanax stare.  Someone needs to remind him to PRETEND.  They call it ACTING, Brad.  Remember how excellent you were in Interview with the Vampire???  Fight Club?  Troy?  What happened?The only other con is the family.  They were boring, but they serve as leverage to get his character to act on behalf of humanity.  As with my first complaint, Pitt does not act like a father who is about to lose his children.  A few times he almost loses them, but no tears, no anxiety, no freaking out, no rage?  What the heck is that all about?Other than that, the movie was fun.  The gore level is low, but surprisingly it has no effect.  There's blood.  The undead are insanely vicious.  They act out in ways you have not seen before.  I promise.  The zombies are scary.  Plain and simple.  The trailers did not do them justice.  The CGI is only a part of the experience.The way Pitt's character has to overcome the threat to humanity by observing his encounters with the &#34;Zekes&#34; and putting the puzzle together is inventive.  The setbacks he encounters all involve zombies, and they all are nail-biters.  He has to piece clues to the origin together.  In the process, he discovers a tactical biological advantage over the zombies that is sickening, scary to use, and quite novel.This movie does EXACTLY what a zombie movie is supposed to.  It puts mankind on a hopeless path.  Zombies are everywhere.  Nowhere is safe for long.  Everywhere he goes, zombies are a serious danger.  Every thing he has to achieve--zombies are in the way.  The pacing is like a roller coaster ride: a slow, thoughtful rise to a drop during which characters contemplate and plan and converse, then a swift drop into hellish scenes during which plans go wrong, fail, and things turn WORSE.  Then repeat.In fact, the tale is far from over.  The world is far from safe.  The movie deserves a sequel.

Without Brad Pitt the movie probably would have found an audience but the other acting was up to par so don't be concerned about it being cheesy.  The concept is as old as I am and it seems the world may someday be consumed by the un-dead but thankfully for guys like the Brad Pitt character the world will always be saved.  There are a few subtle political overtones that someone wanted included in the screenplay but that's okay, what movie today doesn't have an agenda?  I give it three stars because the movie has no redeeming value, (my life isn't better off for seeing it).  It gets a little mundane after a while with the mass number of zombies and there are a bunch, its worth a watch especially since its free with prime, but I wouldn't buy it or care to see it again.",3,Zombies!!!!

1490070,A12LKEM543ILBK,B005LAIIMG,zombie phreak,"[5, 11]","Yes, I read the book first.  I read the book years ago and it to this day it remains one of my favorite books of all time.  When I heard it was going to be made into a live action movie I was very excited!  If you're expecting to see an exact replica of the book on the big screen, you're in for a disappointment.  The book itself is a sort of anthology, and putting an anthology on the big screen is hard to do in a two hour block.  That is unless you're making ""Creep Show""***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***Brad Pitt does an excellent job acting and the character he plays is relatable and interesting and through the entire movie you're rooting for him to make it out alive and get home safe to his family.If you look closely in the movie you'll see subtle references to the book ""The Zombie Survival Guide"" that Max Brooks wrote before he did World War Z.  Like when the doctor holds up an ax and a baseball bat and says ""Both has it's merits.""  There are also references to the book World War Z, like the guy in Israel who talked about the 10th person disagreeing with the other nine because it was his duty.The overall story was good, but there were a few things I didn't like.  Such as making the zombies running zombies and having them shrieking like creatures from another planet.  What was wrong with just making them moan?  They moaned in the book and people loved the book, why fix what isn't broke?  Plus, twelve seconds to turn?  In the Zombie Survival Guide they stated that from bite to reanimation it took a full thirty hours.  But then again I guess that wouldn't make for a very thrilling action movie.Also I was really hoping to see the Battle of Yonkers and the Battle of New Hope.  They were in the book and if you ask me they were the two most interesting parts of the novel.  Plus the movie doesn't really end, it just kind of stopped.  Like they ran out of story and just threw a voice-over in and called it a day.Plus why didn't Brad Pitt just tell his UN buddy what his idea was and then that way they could try his idea out at a facility that wasn't half overrun with zombies?  Not to mention, no one else thought of this idea?  Not a doctor, not a biologist, not a virologist, no it was this guy, a former war correspondent.Moving right along, the Israelis know that the zombies exist and they know they are dangerous.  But they didn't know that noise attracts them?  This didn't come up during the construction of that massive wall?  While running those massive construction machines, they  didn't attract any zombies at all?On top of that there is no way on Earth that the zombies would be able to climb/stack up like they did and get over that wall.  Not to mention that when they fell over the side of the wall that the resulting impact would shatter like every bone in their bodies!  They wouldn't have been a threat to anyone!***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***There are just a bunch of parts of this movie that don't make sense, but there are a few parts of the movie that are pretty good and they make it worth checking out.  If you are a huge fan of the book, you may be disappointed, but if you're looking for an action zombie movie, you'll enjoy this one.",3,Could Have Been Better,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,3230,"['Yes', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'read', 'book', 'years', 'ago', 'day', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'time', 'When', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'made', 'live', 'action', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'excited', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'see', 'exact', 'replica', 'book', 'big', 'screen', ""'re"", 'disappointment', 'book', 'sort', 'anthology', 'putting', 'anthology', 'big', 'screen', 'hard', 'do', 'two', 'hour', 'block', ""'re"", 'making', 'Creep', 'Show', '***SPOILERS***', '***SPOILERS***', '***SPOILERS***Brad', 'Pitt', 'excellent', 'job', 'acting', 'character', 'relatable', 'interesting', 'entire', 'movie', ""'re"", 'rooting', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'get', 'home', 'safe', 'family.If', 'look', 'closely', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'subtle', 'references', 'book', 'Zombie', 'Survival', 'Guide', 'Max', 'Brooks', 'wrote', 'did', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'when', 'doctor', 'up', 'ax', 'baseball', 'bat', 'merits', 'are', 'also', 'references', 'book', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'guy', 'Israel', 'who', 'talked', '10th', 'person', 'disagreeing', 'other', 'nine', 'was', 'duty.The', 'overall', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Such', 'making', 'zombies', 'running', 'zombies', 'having', 'shrieking', 'creatures', 'planet', 'What', 'was', 'wrong', 'just', 'making', 'moan', 'moaned', 'book', 'people', 'loved', 'book', 'why', 'fix', 'what', ""n't"", 'broke', 'twelve', 'seconds', 'turn', 'Zombie', 'Survival', 'Guide', 'stated', 'bite', 'reanimation', 'took', 'full', 'thirty', 'hours', 'then', 'again', 'guess', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'thrilling', 'action', 'movie.Also', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'see', 'Battle', 'Yonkers', 'Battle', 'New', 'Hope', 'were', 'book', 'ask', 'were', 'two', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'novel', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'end', 'just', 'kind', 'stopped', 'ran', 'story', 'just', 'threw', 'voice-over', 'called', 'day.Plus', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'just', 'tell', 'UN', 'buddy', 'what', 'idea', 'was', 'then', 'way', 'could', 'try', 'idea', 'out', 'facility', 'was', ""n't"", 'half', 'overrun', 'zombies', 'Not', 'mention', 'one', 'else', 'thought', 'idea', 'Not', 'doctor', 'not', 'biologist', 'not', 'virologist', 'was', 'guy', 'former', 'war', 'correspondent.Moving', 'right', 'along', 'Israelis', 'know', 'zombies', 'exist', 'know', 'are', 'dangerous', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'noise', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'up', 'construction', 'massive', 'wall', 'running', 'massive', 'construction', 'machines', 'did', ""n't"", 'attract', 'zombies', 'top', 'way', 'Earth', 'zombies', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'climb/stack', 'up', 'did', 'get', 'wall', 'Not', 'mention', 'when', 'fell', 'side', 'wall', 'resulting', 'impact', 'would', 'shatter', 'bone', 'bodies', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'threat', 'anyone', '***END', 'SPOILERS***', '***END', 'SPOILERS***', '***END', 'SPOILERS***There', 'are', 'just', 'bunch', 'parts', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'are', 'few', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'make', 'checking', 'out', 'are', 'huge', 'fan', 'book', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', ""'re"", 'looking', 'action', 'zombie', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'one']",World War Z
