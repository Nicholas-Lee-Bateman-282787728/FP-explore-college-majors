But I can still remember the theater and the weather outside while I was sitting mesmerized inside watching &#34;Breakfast at Tiffany's&#34; in its initial release.  I don't care any more where I was the day JFK bit the dust, but the day Audrey Hepburn died, far too young, immediately put me in mind of her last performance on film as Hap, the angel, in &#34;Always.&#34;  Type-casting had never been so 110% perfect before, or since.",5,The Audrey Hepburn brand is even more exclusive now than the renewed luster she once brought to the Tiffany brand.,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,525,"['was', 'too', 'young', 'appreciate', 'who', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'was', 'when', 'program', 'originally', 'aired', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'theater', 'weather', 'was', 'sitting', 'mesmerized', 'watching', '34', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', '34', 'initial', 'release', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'more', 'where', 'was', 'day', 'JFK', 'dust', 'day', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'died', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'immediately', 'put', 'mind', 'last', 'performance', 'film', 'Hap', 'angel', '34', 'Always.', '34', 'Type-casting', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'so', '110', '%', 'perfect']",Mayerling
1654345,A1CT3VC2YHL2NC,B00D8N92B4,John J. Schauer,"[6, 6]","Although the picture quality is grainy and it's in black-and-white, this TV film is worth getting for two reasons. The first and most obvious is Audrey Hepburn's ravishing portrayal of Mary Vetsera. This production was made the same year she did Funny Face and Love in the Afternoon, so it is prime Audrey at her most exquisite. I also was pleased by Mel Ferrer's performance as Prince Rudolph, which to me seems less like overacting than trying to capture the tortured quality of a disturbed young man. Audrey and Mel had just married prior to the filming of this, and their personal chemistry comes through vividly. The second reason to see this is that it is a scene-by-scene remake of Anatole Litvak's 1936 film of the same name, a highly regarded French production starring Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux. (That film is generally considered by critics to be superior to Terrence Young's 1968 film of the same story with Omar Sharif and Catherine Deneuve, although I must confess I prefer the latter, which also borrows from Litvak's original, although not to anywhere near the same degree.) Although this 1957 version is credited as having been directed by Kirk Browning, it was produced by Litvak, and his influence must have been enormous. If you watch the 1957 and 1936 versions back-to-back, you become aware of how identical they are: the English dialogue of 1957 is virtually the same as the subtitles in the 1936 French version, and even the transition images--such as the large ringing bell superimposed over a postcard shot of St. Stephan's Cathedral to mark the prince's wedding--are the same. Another example is that when the prince attends a ballet performance at the court theater, it is the same ballet--Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker (even though that ballet did not actually premiere until three years after Rudolph's death). The 1936 version is available on a high-quality DVD release from Janus Films, but having it in English is a great advantage to the TV version; for some reason, I find it disconcerting to hear Austrians speaking in French. The disc allows you to watch just the film, or to include the original 1957 commercials. It's amusing that one of the original commercials was for RCA color TVs, in which they asked, ""Wouldn't you rather be seeing this in color?"" to which the obvious answer is, ""Yes!"" Perhaps it was broadcast in color in 1957 but all we have left is a black-and-white kinescope; the package does not specify. Videotape had been invented in 1956, but the third-generation quality of the picture leads me to suspect it was not used for this production. I knocked one star off my rating purely for the inferior picture quality, but it is still quite watchable. The TV film should be in the collections of anyone who is a fan of Miss Hepburn as well as those who are intrigued by the actual story of the Crown Prince's tragic life.",4,AUDREY CAN'T BE BEAT,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",2013,2884,"['picture', 'quality', 'grainy', 'black-and-white', 'TV', 'film', 'getting', 'two', 'reasons', 'first', 'most', 'obvious', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'ravishing', 'portrayal', 'Mary', 'Vetsera', 'production', 'was', 'made', 'same', 'year', 'did', 'Funny', 'Face', 'Love', 'Afternoon', 'prime', 'Audrey', 'most', 'exquisite', 'also', 'was', 'pleased', 'Mel', 'Ferrer', 'performance', 'Prince', 'Rudolph', 'less', 'overacting', 'trying', 'capture', 'tortured', 'quality', 'disturbed', 'young', 'man', 'Audrey', 'Mel', 'had', 'just', 'married', 'prior', 'filming', 'personal', 'chemistry', 'vividly', 'second', 'reason', 'see', 'scene-by-scene', 'remake', 'Anatole', 'Litvak', '1936', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'highly', 'regarded', 'French', 'production', 'starring', 'Charles', 'Boyer', 'Danielle', 'Darrieux', 'film', 'generally', 'considered', 'critics', 'be', 'superior', 'Terrence', 'Young', '1968', 'film', 'same', 'story', 'Omar', 'Sharif', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'must', 'confess', 'prefer', 'latter', 'also', 'Litvak', 'original', 'not', 'anywhere', 'same', 'degree', '1957', 'version', 'credited', 'having', 'been', 'directed', 'Kirk', 'Browning', 'was', 'produced', 'Litvak', 'influence', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'enormous', 'watch', '1957', '1936', 'versions', 'back-to-back', 'become', 'aware', 'how', 'identical', 'are', 'English', 'dialogue', '1957', 'virtually', 'same', 'subtitles', '1936', 'French', 'version', 'even', 'transition', 'images', 'such', 'large', 'ringing', 'bell', 'superimposed', 'postcard', 'shot', 'St.', 'Stephan', 'Cathedral', 'mark', 'prince', 'wedding', 'are', 'same', 'example', 'when', 'prince', 'ballet', 'performance', 'court', 'theater', 'same', 'ballet', 'Tchaikovsky', 'Nutcracker', 'even', 'ballet', 'did', 'not', 'actually', 'premiere', 'three', 'years', 'Rudolph', 'death', '1936', 'version', 'available', 'high-quality', 'DVD', 'release', 'Janus', 'Films', 'having', 'English', 'great', 'advantage', 'TV', 'version', 'reason', 'find', 'disconcerting', 'hear', 'Austrians', 'speaking', 'French', 'disc', 'watch', 'just', 'film', 'include', 'original', '1957', 'commercials', 'amusing', 'one', 'original', 'commercials', 'was', 'RCA', 'color', 'TVs', 'asked', 'Would', ""n't"", 'rather', 'be', 'seeing', 'color', 'obvious', 'answer', 'Yes', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'broadcast', 'color', '1957', 'have', 'left', 'black-and-white', 'kinescope', 'package', 'not', 'specify', 'Videotape', 'had', 'been', 'invented', '1956', 'third-generation', 'quality', 'picture', 'suspect', 'was', 'not', 'used', 'production', 'knocked', 'one', 'star', 'rating', 'purely', 'inferior', 'picture', 'quality', 'still', 'quite', 'watchable', 'TV', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'collections', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'Miss', 'Hepburn', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'are', 'intrigued', 'actual', 'story', 'Crown', 'Prince', 'tragic', 'life']",Mayerling

To see a production like this from when television was in its infancy, starring Audrey Hepburn early in her career, is amazing. There are two versions on the disc, one without and one with commercials from the original airing. I watched the one without, only to watch the one with commercials, right after. They are really wonderful commercials about television sets, RCA, and how color was just coming out. It's kind of wonderful to see those antique sets with all those knobs and no remotes.It'd be easy to fault the production (though I don't intend to) because we've come so very far since then, but there's no way to fault Audrey Hepburn.This is a great find for any collector.",5,Amazing Telecast from 1957,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,770,"['black-and-white', 'production', 'was', 'preserved', 'perhaps', 'imperfectly', 'almost', '60', 'years', 'see', 'production', 'when', 'television', 'was', 'infancy', 'starring', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'early', 'career', 'amazing', 'are', 'two', 'versions', 'disc', 'one', 'one', 'commercials', 'original', 'airing', 'watched', 'one', 'only', 'watch', 'one', 'commercials', 'right', 'are', 'really', 'wonderful', 'commercials', 'television', 'sets', 'RCA', 'how', 'color', 'was', 'just', 'coming', 'out', 'kind', 'wonderful', 'see', 'antique', 'sets', 'knobs', 'remotes.It', ""'d"", 'be', 'easy', 'fault', 'production', 'do', ""n't"", 'intend', ""'ve"", 'come', 'so', 'very', 'far', 'then', 'way', 'fault', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn.This', 'great', 'find', 'collector']",Mayerling

It was made for television in 1957 and is certainly flawed technically. I had read this was a filmed production but it looks more like a Kineoscope. It is in black and white although I had also read the production was broadcast (and shown in Europe) in color.  I also suspect that cutting the script  to 75 minutes to fit in this time slot (Producer's Showcase) is somewhat to blame for at least some of the script problems.  It tends to be disjointed and time to develop from low emotion to high emotion is not available.  Most of the supporting cast are excellent but given little time to develop their characters. Raymond Massey and Diana Wynyard come of best but with too little screen time.  Look fast for an uncredited  Suzy Parker in the second party scene.  Ferrer has to go from sensible to hysterical, to possibly slightly insane without much script time for the changes.  Hard work!  Hepburn has to move from an innocent to a girl willing to enter into a suicide pact too quickly to be totally believable, but again, this is a very rare work so being able to view it, flaws and all,  is a treat for Hepburn fans.",5,Rare Hepburn work flawed though the production may be,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,1197,"['very', 'rare', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'available', 'recently', 'was', 'made', 'television', '1957', 'certainly', 'flawed', 'technically', 'had', 'read', 'was', 'filmed', 'production', 'more', 'Kineoscope', 'black', 'white', 'had', 'also', 'read', 'production', 'was', 'broadcast', 'shown', 'Europe', 'color', 'also', 'suspect', 'cutting', 'script', '75', 'minutes', 'fit', 'time', 'slot', 'Producer', 'Showcase', 'somewhat', 'blame', 'least', 'script', 'problems', 'be', 'disjointed', 'time', 'develop', 'low', 'emotion', 'high', 'emotion', 'not', 'available', 'Most', 'supporting', 'cast', 'are', 'excellent', 'given', 'little', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'Raymond', 'Massey', 'Diana', 'Wynyard', 'come', 'best', 'too', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'Look', 'fast', 'uncredited', 'Suzy', 'Parker', 'second', 'party', 'scene', 'Ferrer', 'go', 'sensible', 'hysterical', 'possibly', 'slightly', 'insane', 'much', 'script', 'time', 'changes', 'Hard', 'work', 'Hepburn', 'move', 'innocent', 'girl', 'willing', 'enter', 'suicide', 'pact', 'too', 'quickly', 'be', 'totally', 'believable', 'again', 'very', 'rare', 'work', 'so', 'being', 'able', 'view', 'flaws', 'treat', 'Hepburn', 'fans']",Mayerling
