But one night I was channel surfing on TV and Lynda Randle had just started to sing God on the Mountain. Well, I was blown away and hooked. I stuck around for the rest and decided to buy the whole thing. What a delight. Set in a church that has superb acoustics, everyone looks and sounds inspired. This is one wonderful song after another. So even if you're not particularly religious or into Gospel music, get this CD, if only to appreciate a well done, uplifting couple hours.
