It's not 100% on with all its skits and jokes, but there are so many and at about 80% &#34;laughing out loud funny&#34;, the movie is far funnier than pretty much anything else in recent memory. It's not up there with the the Coen brothers movies like The Big Lebowski or like Idiocracy, but it is still very funny and warrants multiple viewings. If you are unfortunate enough to be one of the humorlessly super-sensitive PC types, stay away.

1397474,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B004DTLKCG,Micheal Hunt,"[1, 1]","This movie certainly had a lot of potential to be a classic, or at least a cult comedy classic. But it failed to hit the mark and push the boundaries that could have made it great. The premise of the movie is that is not a movie, it is jokes. However, what you do get in the ""movie"" is some clown who is talking you through this stuff, and goes off to meet the movie executives and hires the cast etc in what seems like HIS movie never gets finished, but in between we do get the joke skits and people young and old telling jokes.Had the movie just done what the guy was saying, and been jokes and skits, it probably would have worked so much better and been a lot funnier, but by the end of this movie, I was tired of seeing the Hollywood Style Producer and his troubles that are bringing his movie down.However, in between, the skits and jokes range from a few good laughs, to a, why is that supposed to be funny? While also blended into the mixture is a few ""hey, I've already seen that joke played before"". This movie does try to bring in classics such as Little Johnny, but I guess National Lampoons are unaware of the 2010 cartoon movie from Australia titled; ""Little Johnny: The Movie"" made by Kevin Bloody Wilson. Also, many times in this film, I knew what joke they where doing as soon as they started, a lot of the jokes have been around for years, but the idea of this movie is to bring them into a visual experience. Some I thought where not bad, but others I think work much better by telling them, rather then acting them out... and then quite a few others I thought, If I was directing this scene, I could have got the actors timing or reaction times better to make the scene play out funnier and better... in other words, you watch the scene and think, that exact joke could have been better then the way they acted or preformed that joke.And as an old saying goes, you know you where a child of the 80's when you remember when Chuck Norris was considered cool, Slap Bands where the big fashion, and National Lampoons was considered funny. This movie is not going to elevate them to the top of the comedy game, as in the last 15 years or so, they have had a few decent films, but nothing that would be regarded as high as Animal House or the Vacation movies. So with that said, I can say this one here, well, it wasn't that bad, but again, had so much potential to be so much better had they done more of the jokes instead of the stupid movie maker thing, and done jokes that truly reflected what they talked about in the movie, but didn't tell or show. I'd also say I regard National Lampoons Senior Trip and Repli-Kate to much more recommended viewings then this one, but at the same time, it leaves something like Bag-Boy's or whatever it was called for dead.This is going to be a hit and miss for viewers... if you like dirty jokes, but have heard them all before, this may interest you a bit to see how they are acted out visually... if you have a sense of humor and don't mind a dirty joke, but don't know many, this movie might seem hilarious... for those of you who think something like Greys Anotomey is hilarious when the head nurse says something stupidly sarcastic and laugh because ""it was so out of character for her to be a smart alec like that"" then don't bother watching this.",3,Had potential to be a classic,1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,3309,"['movie', 'certainly', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'be', 'classic', 'least', 'cult', 'comedy', 'classic', 'failed', 'hit', 'mark', 'push', 'boundaries', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'great', 'premise', 'movie', 'not', 'movie', 'jokes', 'However', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'movie', 'clown', 'who', 'talking', 'stuff', 'off', 'meet', 'movie', 'executives', 'cast', 'etc', 'what', 'HIS', 'movie', 'never', 'finished', 'do', 'get', 'joke', 'skits', 'people', 'young', 'old', 'telling', 'movie', 'just', 'done', 'what', 'guy', 'was', 'saying', 'been', 'jokes', 'skits', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'been', 'lot', 'funnier', 'end', 'movie', 'was', 'tired', 'seeing', 'Hollywood', 'Style', 'Producer', 'troubles', 'are', 'bringing', 'movie', 'down.However', 'skits', 'jokes', 'range', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'why', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'also', 'blended', 'mixture', 'few', 'hey', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'joke', 'played', 'movie', 'try', 'bring', 'classics', 'such', 'Little', 'Johnny', 'guess', 'National', 'Lampoons', 'are', 'unaware', '2010', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'Australia', 'titled', 'Little', 'Johnny', 'Movie', 'made', 'Kevin', 'Bloody', 'Wilson', 'Also', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'knew', 'what', 'joke', 'where', 'doing', 'as', 'soon', 'started', 'lot', 'jokes', 'have', 'been', 'years', 'idea', 'movie', 'bring', 'visual', 'experience', 'thought', 'where', 'not', 'bad', 'others', 'think', 'work', 'much', 'better', 'telling', 'rather', 'then', 'acting', 'out', 'then', 'quite', 'few', 'others', 'thought', 'was', 'directing', 'scene', 'could', 'have', 'got', 'actors', 'timing', 'reaction', 'times', 'better', 'make', 'scene', 'play', 'out', 'funnier', 'better', 'other', 'words', 'watch', 'scene', 'think', 'exact', 'joke', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'then', 'way', 'acted', 'preformed', 'joke.And', 'old', 'saying', 'know', 'where', 'child', '80', 'when', 'remember', 'when', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'was', 'considered', 'cool', 'Slap', 'Bands', 'where', 'big', 'fashion', 'National', 'Lampoons', 'was', 'considered', 'funny', 'movie', 'not', 'going', 'elevate', 'top', 'comedy', 'game', 'last', '15', 'years', 'so', 'have', 'had', 'few', 'decent', 'films', 'nothing', 'would', 'be', 'regarded', 'as', 'high', 'Animal', 'House', 'Vacation', 'movies', 'So', 'said', 'can', 'say', 'one', 'here', 'well', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'again', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'done', 'more', 'jokes', 'instead', 'stupid', 'movie', 'maker', 'thing', 'done', 'jokes', 'truly', 'reflected', 'what', 'talked', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'show', ""'d"", 'also', 'say', 'regard', 'National', 'Lampoons', 'Senior', 'Trip', 'Repli-Kate', 'much', 'more', 'recommended', 'viewings', 'then', 'one', 'same', 'time', 'something', 'Bag-Boy', 'whatever', 'was', 'called', 'dead.This', 'going', 'be', 'hit', 'miss', 'viewers', 'like', 'dirty', 'jokes', 'have', 'heard', 'before', 'may', 'interest', 'bit', 'see', 'how', 'are', 'acted', 'out', 'visually', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'dirty', 'joke', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'many', 'movie', 'might', 'seem', 'hilarious', 'who', 'think', 'something', 'Greys', 'Anotomey', 'hilarious', 'when', 'head', 'nurse', 'something', 'stupidly', 'sarcastic', 'laugh', 'was', 'so', 'character', 'be', 'smart', 'alec', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watching']",National Lampoon's Dirty Movie
