I was searching for something comforting and uplifting -- something that would leave me with a sense of happiness and hope.

What is the source of that message?The more I thought about Heaven's Door, the more I felt a depression come over me. I checked out some of the other reviews on Amazon, to find that others were also not enthralled by this piece. Let's just say that the reviews are mixed.

1602539,A5PJHEFSM7PZ3,B009V9N1NE,Sheela,"[25, 34]","Technically speaking this is written very well & the acting & directing are great. It appears to be a mixture of biblical belief & ancestor belief. The bible teaches that our physically dead loved ones are in Heaven, no longer in the vacinity of the earth, but rather that demons parade as familiar spirits to trick & entice us. According to my bible education believing that they are here on earth in spirit helping us is a false, demonic belief. The angels help us, but everything is done in God's power. This film doesn't mention that it's only by God's power that miracles happen if we believe. It teaches more of 'ancestor' worship, minus God's direct participation. It is my understanding that this is a dangerous belief. The credit for healing is given to Riley & not to God. Also, if God uses one to heal another, that person doesn't take on the illness of the person they healed. However, it would be good to prayerfully sit down with the bible & verify what the bible actually teaches. I gave it one star because it goes against what I believe is a healthy belief in God & a healthy form of worship.
