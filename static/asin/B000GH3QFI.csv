D Strother,"[2, 4]","I am a pretty big and long-time JT fan (although to say that he is the greatest folk musician and/or song writer ever seems like a big exageration), and no doubt he deserves big props, and Musicare deserves support.  And I do not want to take anything from either.  And the show was nicely produced.  And JT's wife and kids seem lovely.But I am amazed that there are people out there that really would want to watch this whole show more than once.  Very sentimental, which is fine for once through.A small handful of the performances were anything exceptional, although most were well enough done.  JT's band is excellent.  I just cannot see listening to most of the performances more than once.  JT himself was good, but there is much better concert material of his out there than this.I would disagree with some of the views on performances.I thought Dixie Chicks were great on ""Shower the People"" most of the way through, although I thought they took a big dive by adding their own lyrics and screaming the regular lyrics toward the end.  What a waste.I thought Bruce Springsteen was pretty impressive.  He really interpreted ""Millworker"" in his own style, but I thought he was dead on to the original spirit.  And I am not a huge fan of BS's acoustic efforts.  He sure did not ""phone"" this one in.I thought Alison Krause and Jerry Douglas killed on ""Carolina in My Mind.""  I could watch/heat that one more than once.Bonnie Raitt was quite good on ""Rainy Day Man.""  Not my favorite song, but great to see her is such great form and hear her in such great voice.  One or twice through seems like enough though.I thought Carole King was good on ""You've Got a Friend"" and it was good to see her play, but over the top sentimental and not really anything for the ages.""Mexico"" by Sheryl Crow, Jackson Brown, and David Crosby was ""fine,"" but did have one special thing of getting to see the best harmony singer on earth, David Crosby, do his thing live with someone other than Stills, Nash, and Young.  Although I think he is great--and has not aged a day in decades--I am not sure what JB was supposed to be doing on the stage.  Always pleasent to watch SC.The rest seemed to me forgettable or worse.  Sting gets props for trying, but that performance was hard to watch.",3,yawn,1180569600,"05 31, 2007",2007,2269,"['am', 'pretty', 'big', 'long-time', 'JT', 'fan', 'say', 'greatest', 'folk', 'musician', 'and/or', 'song', 'writer', 'ever', 'big', 'exageration', 'doubt', 'big', 'props', 'Musicare', 'support', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'take', 'anything', 'show', 'was', 'nicely', 'produced', 'JT', 'wife', 'kids', 'seem', 'lovely.But', 'am', 'amazed', 'are', 'people', 'there', 'really', 'would', 'want', 'watch', 'whole', 'show', 'more', 'once', 'Very', 'sentimental', 'fine', 'once', 'through.A', 'small', 'handful', 'performances', 'were', 'anything', 'exceptional', 'most', 'were', 'well', 'enough', 'done', 'JT', 'band', 'excellent', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'listening', 'most', 'performances', 'more', 'once', 'JT', 'was', 'good', 'much', 'better', 'concert', 'material', 'there', 'this.I', 'would', 'disagree', 'views', 'performances.I', 'thought', 'Dixie', 'Chicks', 'were', 'great', 'Shower', 'People', 'most', 'way', 'thought', 'took', 'big', 'dive', 'adding', 'own', 'lyrics', 'screaming', 'regular', 'lyrics', 'end', 'What', 'waste.I', 'thought', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'really', 'interpreted', 'Millworker', 'own', 'style', 'thought', 'was', 'dead', 'original', 'spirit', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'BS', 'acoustic', 'efforts', 'sure', 'did', 'not', 'phone', 'one', 'in.I', 'thought', 'Alison', 'Krause', 'Jerry', 'Douglas', 'killed', 'Carolina', 'My', 'Mind', 'could', 'watch/heat', 'one', 'more', 'once.Bonnie', 'Raitt', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'Rainy', 'Day', 'Man', 'Not', 'favorite', 'song', 'great', 'see', 'such', 'great', 'form', 'hear', 'such', 'great', 'voice', 'One', 'twice', 'enough', 'though.I', 'thought', 'Carole', 'King', 'was', 'good', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Friend', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'play', 'top', 'sentimental', 'not', 'really', 'anything', 'ages', 'Mexico', 'Sheryl', 'Crow', 'Jackson', 'Brown', 'David', 'Crosby', 'was', 'fine', 'did', 'have', 'one', 'special', 'thing', 'getting', 'see', 'best', 'harmony', 'singer', 'earth', 'David', 'Crosby', 'do', 'thing', 'live', 'someone', 'other', 'Stills', 'Nash', 'Young', 'think', 'great', 'not', 'aged', 'day', 'decades', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'JB', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'doing', 'stage', 'Always', 'pleasent', 'watch', 'SC.The', 'rest', 'seemed', 'forgettable', 'worse', 'Sting', 'props', 'trying', 'performance', 'was', 'hard', 'watch']",N/A
1004323,A3FDFB5T7SXZ1,B000GH3QFI,Glenn Mar,"[1, 2]","I love tribute shows and albums, especially well-done ones.  What was particularly nice about this one was the personal touch - James' personal and professional connections to all these performers.  Too bad they weren't able to get Carly Simon, it would have completed the set.Interesting that there are so many diverse opinions on the performances.  Here's my takes:DIXIE CHICKS:  2 stars.  The arrangement is nice, and Natalie's voice is strong, but with this fine 5.1 sound one thing is crystal clear - their harmonies just aren't very rich.  The side chicks should stick with playing something.BONNIE RAITT:  2 stars.  So this is a preference thing - Do you like the Bonnie phase where she covers singer-songwriters like JT and JB?  If you do, you might like this better.  Her voice certainly shows well with age, but I prefer my Bonnie playing something special on the guitar and bringing the groove.INDIA.ARIE:  3 stars.  Solid singing, nice style.  Not really like anyone else there tonight.BROWNE/CROSBY/CROW:  2 stars.  I have to say, while I like the covers she does at her shows, she really doesn't bring enough distinctive to the party at a tribute.  I never am impressed with her tribute performances.STING:  4 stars.  This all depends on how you feel about Sting's solo covers with the ancient stringed instruments.  I like 'em, although I would agree that this would be a lot better had Sting played it publicly enough times to really settle into it.DR. JOHN/TAJ MAHAL:  1 star.  I often like these guys, but they really mailed it in.  How can two guys this soulful fail to find the groove?ALISON KRAUSS/JERRY DOUGLAS:  3 stars.  Jerry's slide/Dobro playing is sweet, and Alison's voice has her trademark sound, but I didn't feel like it worked all that well with this song.  Kinda shrill.KEITH URBAN:  5 stars!  I didn't know anything about this guy, but he really brings it!  I think a lot of the new country stars are pretenders, resorting to ways to blend the shlock of 70's pop with country-ish cliche's.  That's not this at all.  Urban's playing is very tasteful and inventive, and his vocal approach really brings something to this song.  Then he revs it all up with his fingerpicked solo and throws it over to the fiddle player.  Awesome! And he said he was sick as a dog too.BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN:  4 stars.  It's the Nebraska/Tom Joad treatment of ""Millworker"" and there couldn't be a more appropriate song for it.  I love that song.  This is a must see.  But having said that, I don't actually like it better than James'.CAROLE KING:  3 stars.  The performance is the same as every one she's done over the years, but of course what could be more appropriate than the song James sang backup on and was an early hit for him?JAMES TAYLOR:  3 stars.  OK, if the vocals of his entire band don't sound special, there's something wrong with the recording.  I don't know if it's the mix or the equipment, but you know the sound coming out of these folks has to be better than this.  The bass instruments come through fine.  James covers the necessary ground in three songs (team harmonies - rave up - solo pure stuff), but these performances are nothing his fans haven't seen plenty of times.Guess I gotta check out more Keith Urban.  The highlights on this disc are must-see, even if it isn't that good all the way through.",4,"Well worth having, but let's not go overboard",1194480000,"11 8, 2007",2007,3338,"['love', 'tribute', 'shows', 'albums', 'especially', 'well-done', 'ones', 'What', 'was', 'particularly', 'nice', 'one', 'was', 'personal', 'touch', 'James', 'personal', 'professional', 'connections', 'performers', 'Too', 'bad', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'get', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'would', 'have', 'completed', 'set.Interesting', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'diverse', 'opinions', 'performances', 'Here', 'DIXIE', 'CHICKS', '2', 'stars', 'arrangement', 'nice', 'Natalie', 'voice', 'strong', 'fine', '5.1', 'sound', 'one', 'thing', 'crystal', 'clear', 'harmonies', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'rich', 'side', 'chicks', 'should', 'stick', 'playing', 'something.BONNIE', 'RAITT', '2', 'stars', 'preference', 'thing', 'Do', 'Bonnie', 'phase', 'where', 'singer-songwriters', 'JT', 'JB', 'do', 'might', 'like', 'better', 'voice', 'certainly', 'well', 'age', 'prefer', 'Bonnie', 'playing', 'something', 'special', 'guitar', 'bringing', 'groove.INDIA.ARIE', '3', 'stars', 'Solid', 'singing', 'nice', 'style', 'Not', 'really', 'anyone', 'else', 'tonight.BROWNE/CROSBY/CROW', '2', 'stars', 'have', 'say', 'like', 'covers', 'shows', 'really', ""n't"", 'bring', 'enough', 'distinctive', 'party', 'tribute', 'never', 'am', 'impressed', 'tribute', 'performances.STING', '4', 'stars', 'how', 'feel', 'Sting', 'solo', 'ancient', 'stringed', 'instruments', 'like', 'would', 'agree', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'better', 'had', 'Sting', 'played', 'publicly', 'enough', 'times', 'really', 'settle', 'it.DR', 'JOHN/TAJ', 'MAHAL', '1', 'star', 'often', 'guys', 'really', 'mailed', 'How', 'can', 'two', 'guys', 'soulful', 'fail', 'find', 'groove', 'ALISON', 'KRAUSS/JERRY', 'DOUGLAS', '3', 'stars', 'Jerry', 'slide/Dobro', 'playing', 'sweet', 'Alison', 'voice', 'trademark', 'sound', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'worked', 'well', 'song', 'Kinda', 'shrill.KEITH', 'URBAN', '5', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'guy', 'really', 'think', 'lot', 'new', 'country', 'stars', 'are', 'pretenders', 'resorting', 'ways', 'blend', 'shlock', '70', 'pop', 'country-ish', 'cliche', 'not', 'Urban', 'playing', 'very', 'tasteful', 'inventive', 'vocal', 'approach', 'really', 'something', 'song', 'Then', 'revs', 'up', 'fingerpicked', 'solo', 'fiddle', 'player', 'Awesome', 'said', 'was', 'sick', 'dog', 'too.BRUCE', 'SPRINGSTEEN', '4', 'stars', 'Nebraska/Tom', 'Joad', 'treatment', 'Millworker', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'song', 'love', 'song', 'must', 'see', 'having', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'better', ""James'.CAROLE"", 'KING', '3', 'stars', 'performance', 'same', 'one', 'done', 'years', 'course', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'appropriate', 'song', 'James', 'sang', 'backup', 'was', 'early', 'hit', 'JAMES', 'TAYLOR', '3', 'stars', 'OK', 'vocals', 'entire', 'band', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'special', 'something', 'wrong', 'recording', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'mix', 'equipment', 'know', 'sound', 'coming', 'folks', 'be', 'better', 'bass', 'instruments', 'come', 'fine', 'James', 'necessary', 'ground', 'three', 'songs', 'team', 'rave', 'up', 'solo', 'pure', 'stuff', 'performances', 'are', 'nothing', 'fans', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'plenty', 'times.Guess', 'got', 'ta', 'check', 'out', 'more', 'Keith', 'Urban', 'highlights', 'disc', 'are', 'must-see', 'even', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'way']",N/A

Personal faves are Bonnie Raitt's Rainy Day Man, Keith Urban's Country Road, and India Arie's Secret O' Life.

1004325,AFE0AGQT50MBJ,B000GH3QFI,KV Trout,"[2, 2]","I had never heard about this and just ran into it by chance. I have been a big JT fan since he came out on Apple Records in 1968 or so with the album ""James Taylor"".I've seen him live once and have seen most of the live dvd's he has available.I would not have chosen all these artists as the best to perform this tribute, but the funny thing is, some of the ones I would have chosen (Sting, for example) did the least exciting performances, while some I would never have chosen (Keith Urban, for example) had some of the best performances.Here's a track by track breakdown and rating:Shower The People -- The Dixie Chicks- I thought this was just okay. I'm not a big fan of their's. Their voices sound almost cartoonishly shrill to me, and I don't think they have all that much soul. I'll give their performance here a 3 out of 5.Rainy Day Man -- Bonnie Raitt- Very good performance. Bonnie is an original, and she did a great job, though nothing spectacular. 4 stars.Secret O'Life -- India.Arie- I had never seen her perform before and I thought she did a very good job on this song. 4 and 1/2 stars.Mexico -- Jackson Browne, David Crosby, and Sheryl Crow- This is the 2nd time I've seen Jackson Browne come out on a tribute show where he is confined to background singing (the other was a Roy Orbison show). I'd much rather have seen him do something with Crosby, without Crowe. Crowe's performance was okay but nothing great. 3 stars.You Can Close Your Eyes -- Sting- I thought Sting would do something great but this just was not the song for his style and his voice. 2 stars.Everybody Has The Blues -- Dr. John and Taj Mahal- This COULD have been great, but it seemed like they didn't spend enough time practicing it. The arrangement was great and it fit their styles, but Taj's playing lacked conviction and Mac's piano was not mic'd well and he seemed to mail in his vocal. 3 stars.Carolina In My Mind -- Alison Krauss and Jerry Douglas- Finally, a stand out performance! Douglas's dobro or whatever it is, was amazing, and Krauss's vocal was perfection, she sang this like an angel. This was probably the best performance of the night! 5 stars.Country Road -- Keith Urban- He said he was sick and he looked kind of sick, too. I'd never heard him before and expected a run of the mill male country vocal performance. Well, his vocal was certainly nothing outstanding, but his guitar playing - WOW! This was one of my favorite performances - great arrangement! 5 stars.Millworker -- Bruce Springsteen- I'm NOT a Springsteen fan, at all. Yet this was a highlight of the night. He made this song his own, and his performance was sincere and strong! 5 stars.You've Got A Friend -- Carole King- Let's face it, Carole King is losing her voice. Until James came out to join her I was thinking, man, this sucks. But the love and friendship between them and James' vocals pulled it out, and it became one of the highlights due to the emotional impact. 4 and 1/2 stars.She A Little Light -- James Taylor- One of my all time favorite songs by James. However, they didn't have the background singers mic'd well. This is much better-performed on one of the other JT dvd's (Live at Beacon?). Still, 5 stars.How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You) -- James Taylor- Dang, this guy is good! His band, the arrangements, his vocals, everything just falls right into place to make the most heavenly music!5 starsFire And Rain -- James Taylor- Highlighting James' talent as a singer/songwriter, this is a perfect song for just James and his guitar. 5 starsSo the 2nd half of the concert is much better than the first half. The 2nd half makes it all worthwhile. I've gotta give serious consideration to Keith Urban's music now, and I want to hear more Alison Krause, and I have to find an mp3 of the Springsteen performance, too.Let me say a few other things about this dvd:JT makes one of the funniest jokes about receiving an award that I've ever heard. You have to see it and hear it to appreciate it.It was nice getting to see James' wife and kids for the first time and see that his brother Livingston showed up and did some singing on the final group performance.Anyone know whatever happened to Kate?Overall, this is a very enjoyable concert experience. I do recommend it even if some of my ratings of the performances are not as high as I'd have liked to have given. I figure everyone is going to have their own personal taste - some will prefer the performances I did not like, and vice versa. So, I do recommend you at least rent this to see if you like it or not, and then if you do, you may want to buy it.",4,Very worthwhile but not perfect...,1200009600,"01 11, 2008",2008,4600,"['had',

He's been around along damn time and has more than a coupl'a great songs....... But, this show was really kinda weenie.The one bright spot was seeing Carol King sing her great ballad, ""You've got a Friend""....... Carol is a genius..... She didn't drop the key down half an octave because her voice has gotten a bit older. She was willing to simply sing her heart out, exactly like she wrote it.....come what may..... Whatt'a pro.The rest of this concert, although replete with stars, left me wishing I had a DVD of James singing some of his earliest gigs at the Troubadour in Santa Monica... The guests ""stars"" simply walked onstage, sang the lyrics off the teleprompter and gushed something worshipful about how JT had inspired their lives.... or that they're a better person because of his tunes.It was pure Hollywood, music biz, cookie cutter cockie-doodee............
