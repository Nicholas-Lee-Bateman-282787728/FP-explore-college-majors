882097,A28MYC8KKCK2FZ,B0007LFPJI,Alice L. Moore,"[3, 4]","This picks up directly after the events of Season 2Monarch of the Glen - Series Two.  Archie needs some serious financing of his estate and quick.  The bank sends out Stella Moon an accomplished executive/BOW(depending on your perspective).  Throughout the season she has mandates and proposals that go against the Glenbogle household.  Alexandra Gilbreath is a good addition to the cast.  However, the show's writers did not seem consistent with her character development.  An ambitious woman can fall in love.  In one episode she was intentionally sabotaging her chance for a huge career advance.  For what?  She had fallen in love with Archie/Glenbogle.  No promise of a ring.  If she is having conflicts make it without having to suspend too much disbelief.Simon Weir was also a good addition as the cad/developer, Stuart MacIntosh.  You wanted him to be just the honest business/love rival to Archie.I know many people are dismayed by Archie's emotional density, I found this to be positive.  It established consistency to the story.  After all, it shows he's a chip off of the old block of Hector MacDonald.Susan Hampshire continues to be excellent.  Julian Fellowes as Hector's frenemy Kilwilly adds to the cast.  Hamish Clark, Alexander Morton, and Dawn Steele as the household adds to the series.Katrina Finlay's(Lorraine Pilkington) exit did not affect myself as much as others' exits.Monarch of the Glen has a character for everyone.",4,Monarch of the Glen: Season 3,1200787200,"01 20, 2008",2008,1444,"['up', 'directly', 'events', 'Season', '2Monarch', 'Glen', 'Series', 'Two', 'Archie', 'serious', 'financing', 'estate', 'quick', 'bank', 'out', 'Stella', 'Moon', 'accomplished', 'executive/BOW', 'depending', 'perspective', 'season', 'mandates', 'proposals', 'go', 'Glenbogle', 'household', 'Alexandra', 'Gilbreath', 'good', 'addition', 'cast', 'However', 'show', 'writers', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'consistent', 'character', 'development', 'ambitious', 'woman', 'can', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'intentionally', 'sabotaging', 'chance', 'huge', 'career', 'advance', 'what', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'Archie/Glenbogle', 'No', 'promise', 'ring', 'having', 'conflicts', 'make', 'having', 'suspend', 'too', 'much', 'disbelief.Simon', 'Weir', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'addition', 'cad/developer', 'Stuart', 'MacIntosh', 'wanted', 'be', 'just', 'honest', 'business/love', 'rival', 'Archie.I', 'know', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'dismayed', 'Archie', 'emotional', 'density', 'found', 'be', 'positive', 'established', 'consistency', 'story', 'chip', 'old', 'block', 'Hector', 'MacDonald.Susan', 'Hampshire', 'be', 'excellent', 'Julian', 'Fellowes', 'Hector', 'frenemy', 'Kilwilly', 'cast', 'Hamish', 'Clark', 'Alexander', 'Morton', 'Dawn', 'Steele', 'household', 'series.Katrina', 'Finlay', 'Lorraine', 'Pilkington', 'exit', 'did', 'not', 'affect', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'exits.Monarch', 'Glen', 'character', 'everyone']",N/A

Each one was funny and warm and very likable, with the exception of Justine, Archie's old girlfriend, who quickly went back to London.  It made me happy just to watch these really nice people in their beautiful countryside, working away at the struggles of their lives always helping one another out and coming out on top.My love affair carried through Season II and into most of Season III.  About three quarters of the way through I found myself rooting for the people the show was obviously trying to make into the bad guys.  I got a little tired of the gollie (sp?) in his two-day stubble, uttering words of wisdom but I could deal with that.  Then, the very interesting and not unattractive bank officer. Stella, showed a softer side that endeared her to me.  I started pulling for her to win the heart of Archie although I knew she didn't have a chance with the writers.

882109,A2DMEJI0Z0H99J,B0007LFPJI,Scott Promish,"[3, 5]","Monarch of the Glen is the ongoing story of a Scottish highland clan struggling to save their ancestral home from massive debt and increasing commercialization.  The first two seasons were a charming mix of drama and comedy, neither too weighty nor too absurd, and a refreshing change from everything else on television.I didn't notice if the writers changed, or if the producers started diverging from the original novels, but for whatever reason the show has started to lose its touch.  With certain supporting characters from previous seasons now gone and the action centering more on the estate, a formula has begun to show.  Generally, some outsider arrives to threaten some kind of legal action, things look bleak for awhile, and then the family and staff pull some sort of miracle in the last fifteen minutes to save the day.A bank representative is assigned to stay at Glenbogle estate to get it running properly and formulate a plan to keep it economically viable.  At first she seems harsh but is doing what must be done to keep the MacDonalds from losing their home entirely.  But by the end of the season, after a contrived romantic subplot comes into play, she becomes completely unsympathetic.  In one episode, she sabotages a major estate event so that she will have to spend more time with the MacDonalds.  Her reasoning is illogical, her motive is unconvincing, and her plan requires the rest of the cast to act idiotically out of character, which they do.Another particularly poor episode focuses on Duncan the handyman, whose French pen pal surprises him by telling him she is coming to visit.  If you guessed that he lied to her about what he does for a living, and now has to find a way of covering it up, then you too know how many times this kind of story has been done in sitcoms past.  It's the kind of story that should be beneath a show like this.  It takes the ""comedy of errors"" too far into the realm of silliness.The season ends with the cartoonish death of one of the main characters and an out-of-the-blue marriage proposal. (Marriages are never good for television series.  Let's hope a baby isn't in the works as well.)  The show is becoming a parody of what it once was and while some of the episodes are still moderately enjoyable, it has lost what once made it great.",3,Monarch jumps the shark,1217548800,"08 1, 2008",2008,2305,"['Monarch', 'Glen', 'ongoing', 'story', 'Scottish', 'highland', 'clan', 'struggling', 'save', 'ancestral', 'home', 'massive', 'debt', 'increasing', 'commercialization', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'charming', 'mix', 'drama', 'comedy', 'too', 'weighty', 'too', 'absurd', 'refreshing', 'change', 'everything', 'else', 'television.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'writers', 'changed', 'producers', 'started', 'diverging', 'original', 'novels', 'reason', 'show', 'started', 'lose', 'touch', 'certain', 'supporting', 'characters', 'previous', 'seasons', 'now', 'gone', 'action', 'centering', 'more', 'estate', 'formula', 'begun', 'show', 'Generally', 'outsider', 'threaten', 'kind', 'legal', 'action', 'things', 'look', 'bleak', 'awhile', 'then', 'family', 'staff', 'pull', 'sort', 'miracle', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'save', 'day.A', 'bank', 'representative', 'assigned', 'stay', 'Glenbogle', 'estate', 'get', 'running', 'properly', 'formulate', 'plan', 'keep', 'economically', 'viable', 'first', 'harsh', 'doing', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'keep', 'MacDonalds', 'losing', 'home', 'entirely', 'end', 'season', 'contrived', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'play', 'completely', 'unsympathetic', 'one', 'episode', 'major', 'estate', 'event', 'will', 'have', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'MacDonalds', 'reasoning', 'illogical', 'motive', 'unconvincing', 'plan', 'rest', 'cast', 'act', 'idiotically', 'character', 'do.Another', 'particularly', 'poor', 'episode', 'Duncan', 'handyman', 'French', 'pen', 'pal', 'surprises', 'telling', 'coming', 'visit', 'guessed', 'lied', 'what', 'living', 'now', 'find', 'way', 'covering', 'up', 'then', 'too', 'know', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'kind', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'sitcoms', 'kind', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'show', 'comedy', 'errors', 'too', 'far', 'realm', 'silliness.The', 'season', 'cartoonish', 'death', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'out-of-the-blue', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'Marriages', 'are', 'never', 'good', 'television', 'series', 'Let', 'hope', 'baby', ""n't"", 'works', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'becoming', 'parody', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'episodes', 'are', 'still', 'moderately', 'enjoyable', 'lost', 'what', 'once', 'made', 'great']",N/A
