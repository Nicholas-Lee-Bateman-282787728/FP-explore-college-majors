Burchfield,"[0, 1]","I bought this DVD set to finish out my collection of all 10 seasons and liked the picture/color quality about as much as anything in the season. The series may have gone on too long for it's own good, I think the writing really began slipping with the conclusion of the high school years (which season was that?). Someday I'll get around to watching this set, probably won't ever go Blu-ray unless it's really cheap and covers all 10 seasons.It's been months since I looked my set over but I think #10 even had the weakest set of extras of the series.",3,Weak ending to what had been a very interesting series,1354060800,"11 28, 2012",2012,551,"['bought', 'DVD', 'set', 'finish', 'out', 'collection', '10', 'seasons', 'liked', 'picture/color', 'quality', 'as', 'much', 'anything', 'season', 'series', 'may', 'have', 'gone', 'too', 'long', 'own', 'good', 'think', 'writing', 'really', 'began', 'slipping', 'conclusion', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'season', 'was', 'Someday', ""'ll"", 'get', 'watching', 'set', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'go', 'Blu-ray', 'really', 'cheap', '10', 'seasons.It', 'been', 'months', 'looked', 'set', 'think', '10', 'even', 'had', 'weakest', 'set', 'extras', 'series']",Smallville: The Final Season

Maybe all of 4 and part of 5.  But around 5 or 6 it got good again.  Then around 8 or 9 it sucked again.  10, the last season, sucked too.  That's why I didn't watch it till I decided to complete my collection recently.  I had the first 8 seasons.  Might as well complete my collection.  I'm glad I did, because I got to watch a whole bunch of episodes that were new to me.  They weren't as bad as I thought they'd be, but still not as good as when the show started.  Heck, after 3 seasons, I'm sure you run out of ideas then get more later on.  That's probably what happened.  I didn't watch half of season 10 on TV, nor did I download it on a sharing network like I did for 8 and 9.  I did however watch the final episode.  Couldn't miss that one!  I would've rated this one 3 stars, but it had some good episodes.  One thing I didn't like was in the last episode, they didn't really show Clark close up in the full Superman suit.  All those scenes were from afar and computer rendered I'm sure.  I'm not happy about that and remember not liking that when it first aired on TV.",4,Okay to Good.

1351851,AI46E73DWKD2B,B003L77GG0,BackToGood,"[4, 7]","The 10th, and final, season of SMALLVILLE was a refreshing mix of the old Smallville and the new. Tom Welling did some of his best acting in Season 10 as Clark Kent/The Blur and soon-to-be Superman! Clark finally morphed into a confident, mature hero that longtime viewers could see becoming Supes! And FINALLY Erica Durance was in EVERY SINGLE episode in Season 10 as Lois Lane! Welling and Durance as Clark and Lois were able to take their chemistry to another level and become the iconic couple. It may be ""Smallville"", but this version of Lois and Clark is going to be a tough act to follow!In addition to Welling and Durance, Season 10 regulars included Cassidy Freeman (as Tess Mercer since Season 8) and Justin Hartley (as Oliver Queen aka Green Arrow since Season 6). And Allison Mack reprised her role as Chloe Sullivan in a limited fashion (appearing several eps throughout the season, including the finale).Season 10 also brought back virtually all of the important characters during the show's formative years (Martha and Jonathan Kent, Lex and Lionel Luthor, Zod, Kara, Brainiac). These old characters served as a reminder of where Smallville came from and how it got to the point where it was, while still managing to move the story along.The Season 10 story arcs are the arrival of Darkseid through the portal that was opened in the Season 9 finale when Zod and the Kandorians went to their new home world, the clone Lex storyline, and the VRA subplot. While I thought the Darkseid stuff was a mixed bag and the VRA pretty useless, the clone Lex story was the saving grace of the subplots, as well as Clois. Also, it was in the Season 9 finale that Lois realized Clark's dual identity so in Season 10, she knows all about him, but doesn't let him onto it until the right time.Season 10 got off to a great start with the fascinating episode Ep 1-LAZARUS, a wonderful teaser as to Clark's future potential as Superman with an aging clone of Lex Luthor (excellently played by MacKenzie Gray) escaping a Luthorcorp facility and wreaking havoc on Metropolis and Lois Lane; Clark has to save the day in typical Superman fashion! Also, a lone surviving clone of Lex, the little boy Alexander, is saved by Tess from the facility before it is destroyed and this clone ages to several stages of Lex's life in future Season 10 eps. The ep ends with a heartfelt conversation between Clark and Jonathan's ghost (reprised by the esteemed John Scheider) and the entrance of Darkseid!Arguably the best ep of Season 10 is Ep 4-HOMECOMING (also the 200th ep of the series), which has a sort of ""Christmas Carol"" vibe with an improved, futuristic good-guy version of Brainiac (brilliantly reprised by James Marsters, who played the role in Seasons 5 and 7) taking Clark on a journey through his past, present, and future which leads Clark to realize his potential as Earth's savior. It also includes one of the best moments of Season 10 (heck, the series!) with a beautiful Clois scene at the end of a declaration of love and Clark floating!Other early standouts of Season 10 include the underrated Ep 5-ISIS, a very funny, quick-witted ep which allows the 4 main cast members to all shine (really enjoyed Justin Hartley's work in this ep!) and includes semi-regular character Cat Grant (played hilariously by Keri Lynn Pratt introduced in Ep 2-SHIELD) and has yet another smashing Clois moment at the end with Tom Welling delivering an amazing speech to Lois! Also Ep 7-AMBUSH brings back the always reliable Michael Ironside (reprising the role of Lois' dad General Sam Lane) and Peyton List (again playing Lois' sister Lucy); both characters were introduced in Season 4, Lois' first season on the show. Ep 8-ABANDONED is a haunting ep where Clark, Lois, and Tess are forced to confront their familial demons from the past. Ep 10-LUTHOR is one of the top Season 10 eps with Clark accidentally going to an alternate universe where we again get to see Lionel Luthor (reprised by the great John Glover, who was a regular for the first 7 seasons), who in the alternate world raised Clark's evil doppel ganger Clark Luthor. Ep 11-ICARUS is the one where Clark proposes to Lois.The second half of Season 10 includes the standout eps 13-BEACON (where the radiant Annette O'Toole returns as Martha Kent) and a teenaged clone of Lex (well played by teen idol Lucas Grabeel, who actually played the real teen Lex back in a Season 6 flashback episode) seeks revenge on Clark. Ep 14-MASQUERADE is a funny, witty ep, the one where Clark realizes he must start wearing glasses to hide his true identity.The last part of Season 10 goes out on a high note with a string of awesome eps! In Ep 16-SCION, the clone Lex story comes to an end as the teen clone (Grabeel again in a fine turn) turns out to share Lex and Clark's DNA and ends up as Connor Kent (future Superboy!). Ep 17-KENT is another best ep of the season contender as Clark Luthor returns sending Clark back to the alternate world where he meets none other than the alternate Jonathan Kent (reprised again by Schneider), a bitter man because the alternate Oliver Queen had mined farmers' land for Kryptonite in order to find a way to stop Clark Luthor. Ep 18-BOOSTER is a suprisingly entertaining ep with future superhero Booster Gold (hilariously played by Eric Martsoff) dropping in on Metropolis to steal Clark's thunder, as Clark must immerse himself more and more into the nerd-with-glasses persona to throw people off. Ep 19-DOMINION marks the return of Zod (reprised by the mercurial Callum Blue, who played the role all of Season 9) as Clark and Oliver travel to the Phantom Zone where the Kandorians have imprisoned Zod. Ep 20-PROPHECY is the pre-finale ep where Lois gets Clark's powers for a day and makes a shocking pronouncement at the end; Durance's emotional acting at the end of this ep and also at the end of Dominion is Emmy-worthy!Eps 21 and 22 are the FINALE parts 1 and 2 (shown as a 2-hour episode originally) that includes Clark and Lois' wedding, Darkseid's attack on Earth, and the return of none other than Lex Luthor (reprised by the terrific Michael Rosenbaum, who brilliantly essayed the role for the first 7 seasons)!In the end, I'd say SMALLVILLE gave the fans what it really wanted...Clark Kent becoming Superman!Season 10 Regulars: Tom Welling, Erica Durance, Cassidy Freeman, Justin Hartley, and Allison Mack.",5,Extremely satisfying final season!,1314144000,"08 24,

1351856,A1E330XTGY2EP9,B003L77GG0,brainiac723,"[27, 33]","Let me start off by saying that I have been a DIEHARD Smallville fan since its inception in 2001. Although I have thoroughly enjoyed each season, season 10 is definitely the weakest of the series.  One of the problems of this season is that they take DC's greatest villain Darkseid and reduce him to a ""smokey"" afterthought. Smallville has always done a great job of integrating villains from the comics and putting their own little twist on it to fit a CW budget but Darkseid fails to make the cut considerably. Lex Luthor, Brainiac, Zod, and even Doomsday have all been transfered from the comic book pages onto the TV screen with great results but Darkseid literary makes an appearance for like 10 seconds in a total of 22 episodes. There is so much untapped potential with the Darkseid character which ultimately makes this season disappointing. Another disappointing element to this season is the sub plot of Oliver Queen revealing his identity to the world. This contributes nothing to the overall plot arch and what makes it worse is that it was directly ripped off from the movie Iron Man. The introduction of Cat Grant leading the opposition against the superheroes is pointless as well. Her character is annoying, irritating, and contributes little to the season. They should have used the hot Cat Grant from season 8 and perhaps introduce an interesting little love triangle when Lois Lane leaves for Egypt. Like I said, most of this season has so much untapped potential. Another disappointing element of the season is the return of Chloe. Chloe is one of Smallville's most popular characters and her return is shoddy at best. The episode ""Collateral"" which introduces her return and is a rip-off of the Matrix is perhaps one of the worst episodes of the series. Other elements of the season such as the Vigilante Registration Act, The Suicide Squad, and the government's involvement of superheroes is shoddy, contrived, cheesy and unsubstantial at best. The episode Fortune which blatantly imitates the Hangover movies all but exemplifies the problem of this season in that it borrows from all sorts of popular movies and in the process loses its identity as a great Superman show. Also, Clark Kent decides to shed the Black trenchcoat and wear a Michael Jackson inspired ""Thriller"" jacket to reflect his growing optimism and hope necessary to become the Man of Steel. Unfortunately the new costume is very very cheesy. He would have probably been better off he kept the Black Trenchcoat untill he becomes the Man of Steel.Despite the disappointing nature of season 10, The series finale blew me away. I have to say the Series Finale is the best series Finale of any television show EVER! They did a perfect job of wrapping up 10 seasons of great memories while leading the groundwork for his role as Superman. I was absolutely shocked at the quality of the final episode especially since the rest of the season was mediocre. Other highlights include the season premiere as well as the 200th episode ""Homecoming"" which are some of the top episodes in the series. Overall, If you watched all of the other seasons and enjoyed them I strongly recommend you pick up the Final season to see how it all ends. The package is a mixed bag but the resounding conclusion will more than make up for it!",3,Disappointing Final Season but with an EPIC Finale!,1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,3303,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'have', 'been', 'DIEHARD', 'Smallville', 'fan', 'inception', '2001', 'have', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'season', '10', 'definitely', 'weakest', 'series', 'One', 'problems', 'season', 'take', 'DC', 'greatest', 'villain', 'Darkseid', 'reduce', 'smokey', 'afterthought', 'Smallville', 'always', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'integrating', 'villains', 'comics', 'putting', 'own', 'little', 'twist', 'fit', 'CW', 'budget', 'Darkseid', 'make', 'cut', 'considerably', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Brainiac', 'Zod', 'even', 'Doomsday', 'have', 'been', 'transfered', 'comic', 'book', 'pages', 'TV', 'screen', 'great', 'results', 'Darkseid', 'literary', 'appearance', '10', 'seconds', 'total', '22', 'episodes', 'so', 'much', 'untapped', 'potential', 'Darkseid', 'character', 'ultimately', 'season', 'disappointing', 'disappointing', 'element', 'season', 'sub', 'plot', 'Oliver', 'Queen', 'revealing', 'identity', 'world', 'nothing', 'overall', 'plot', 'arch', 'what', 'worse', 'was', 'directly', 'ripped', 'off', 'movie', 'Iron', 'Man', 'introduction', 'Cat', 'Grant', 'leading', 'opposition', 'superheroes', 'pointless', 'as', 'well', 'character', 'annoying', 'irritating', 'little', 'season', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'hot', 'Cat', 'Grant', 'season', '8', 'perhaps', 'introduce', 'interesting', 'little', 'love', 'triangle', 'when', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Egypt', 'said', 'most', 'season', 'so', 'much', 'untapped', 'potential', 'disappointing', 'element', 'season', 'return', 'Chloe', 'Chloe', 'one', 'Smallville', 'most', 'popular', 'characters', 'return', 'shoddy', 'best', 'episode', 'Collateral', 'return', 'rip-off', 'Matrix', 'perhaps', 'one', 'worst', 'episodes', 'series', 'Other', 'elements', 'season', 'such', 'Vigilante', 'Registration', 'Act', 'Suicide', 'Squad', 'government', 'involvement', 'superheroes', 'shoddy', 'contrived', 'cheesy', 'unsubstantial', 'best', 'episode', 'Fortune', 'blatantly', 'Hangover', 'movies', 'problem', 'season', 'sorts', 'popular', 'movies', 'process', 'identity', 'great', 'Superman', 'show', 'Also', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'shed', 'Black', 'trenchcoat', 'wear', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'inspired', 'Thriller', 'jacket', 'reflect', 'growing', 'optimism', 'hope', 'necessary', 'become', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Unfortunately', 'new', 'costume', 'very', 'very', 'cheesy', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'better', 'kept', 'Black', 'Trenchcoat', 'Man', 'Steel.Despite', 'disappointing', 'nature', 'season', '10', 'series', 'finale', 'away', 'have', 'say', 'Series', 'Finale', 'best', 'series', 'Finale', 'television', 'show', 'EVER', 'did', 'perfect', 'job', 'wrapping', 'up', '10', 'seasons', 'great', 'memories', 'leading', 'groundwork', 'role', 'Superman', 'was', 'absolutely', 'shocked', 'quality', 'final', 'episode', 'especially', 'rest', 'season', 'was', 'mediocre', 'Other', 'highlights', 'include', 'season', 'premiere', 'as', 'well', '200th', 'episode', 'Homecoming', 'are', 'top', 'episodes', 'series', 'Overall', 'watched', 'other', 'seasons', 'enjoyed', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'pick', 'up', 'Final', 'season', 'see', 'how', 'package', 'mixed', 'bag', 'resounding', 'conclusion', 'will', 'more', 'make', 'up']",Smallville: The Final Season

It's imperfect, yet wildly engaging and brimming with heart. If you expect a gritty, dark, 'edgy' show or one that is slavishly faithful to the comics, (and I totally understand that those are many fans' preferences!), then you'll probably be disappointed. If, however, you're looking for a spin on the legend that contains unapologetically large servings of sweet earnestness, emotion, romance, humor and hope, then you may find this as irresistibly addictive and enjoyable as I did.I'm among those who actually preferred these later seasons to the earlier and (especially!) middle ones, though I respect that many disagree! Honestly, seasons 8-10 may be personal favorites of the series. I just personally loved Clark slowly but surely coming into his own as a superhero and as a man, the merciful end of his painfully protracted, soapy romance with Lana, the fabulous Chloe finally getting over Clark and finding both her place in the world and eventual love with Oliver, whose 'hero' arc as The Green Arrow is arguably even more compelling than Clark's. Like many fans, I missed Lex, but there were enough other colorful characters and storylines to keep me very happily hooked.I came into this series very skeptical, but I was actually kind of stunned by just how much I loved it.

Of course the march to the finale kept fans tuning in week after week. I have watched the show for years and enjoyed it although I realized it was uneven at times and didn't always pay off. To me, the final show, ""Finale"" is a perfect example of this. A lot of season ten was spent on Clark and Lois Lane's relationship and plans for the wedding. The first hour of the finale focused on the wedding and then, guess what? No wedding! It may happen seven years from now! What??!! Then, we were teased with the Superman suit in the first episode and other shows including the next-to-last show. Did they pay that off? No, of course not! Welling never dons the suit. We get a CGI Superman flying and a rip of his shirt revealing the Superman logo for the final shot. Even an extreme close-up of Welling with a CGI cape billowing behind him. Again, what the heck??!! I really had faith that writers Brian Peterson and Kelly Souders would come through. Now I am left with a disappointment with the series due to the finale and Tom not flying with the suit on. The pay-offs were lacking. We did get a great scene of Jonathan handing the suit to Clark (for what good that did!) and a great shot of Clark flying out of the fortress and I liked the shot too when Lois saw him flying outside the plane. But I had hoped to smile when I think of the finale and I don't. I did like the scene when Jonathan and Martha and Clark all embrace in the barn as Apocalypse is heading toward earth. One can only hope that maybe a reunion movie will be made some day and Tom Welling, realizing how disappointed many fans were, will actually no longer fear to put the suit on.

Johnson ""'ntohign slhe thaersam'""","[2, 4]","Though it lagged in some episodes, Smallville in its whole is representative of nearly 80 years of testament to the human spirit. Equality, government, immigration, sharing of knowledge and technology - you name it, it has graced Superman-based anything through the character's life. Smallville was to be the story that was never told - what happened to change Clark Kent to the Man of Steel.Despite episodic lag, Smallville grew into a heavy head of steam during seasons eight and nine. And we knew what it was leading up to: allowing us to believe a man can fly.The only negative in the climatic Season Ten is when Clark dons the suit. We never get a good look, the character is far away in the distant frame, et al. The DC purist in me wants to give it Five Stars for accomplishing exactly what it set out to do, and the fact that by the by they did it well. Maybe the intent was for us to see Superman's initial appearances as the John Q. on the streets of Metropolis - faintly, a blur of colour, from a distance safe enough for a mortal to be generally assured survival without the rendering of aid. If that indeed was the intent (and no special features I've seen testify to that point), then bravo!But the fanboy in me wanted to see something epic. Something worthy of a ten year old promise. The producers knew exactly where they were going to end up: Clark in the Suit. There was never any doubt. Quite simply, I was expecting something Super.So please, do not take a mid-grade biased heavily by the series finale at face value. The series as a whole definitively averages four stars per episode, and Season Ten is inclusive to that.The special features of this final season are on par with everything we've seen included so far: random commentary, occasional featurettes, and the like. But you didn't buy this DVD set for the extras.

1351878,A6ZKAHCONUHX5,B003L77GG0,Eugene Suh,"[2, 5]","The Final Season of ""Smallville"" was such a disappointment that I don't know where to begin to describe the pathetic and miserable season it was. First off, having almost all the ""dead"" characters (e.g. Lex and Lionel Luthor, Jonathan Kent) return was expected since they were integral to the show, but did anyone notice Lana Lang did not return to the final season's episode? True, she does have kryptonite infused in her body on the show, but at least show her from a distance or something. Her disappearance in the final episode cast a dark cloud and did not bring resolution to the show. Did Kristin Kreuk not want to be a part of the final season/episode? Hmm... Second, the villain, Darkseid, was introduced as a puff of black smoke. Ridiculous. In the comics and the animated series, he's not a puff of black smoke, but gigantic, ""flesh"", and intimidating. To introduce Darkseid as a puff of black smoke was disrespectful to the fans of this legendary/cult show. What were the writers smoking? It's no wonder, since Alfred Gough and Miles Millar left the show after season 7. Third, season 10, as well as season 8 and 9, could have been more if Bruce Wayne/Batman's character was introduced (just like most of the other Justice League members were introduced, except Green Lantern and Wonderwoman). Since Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent have history in the comics/animated films/etc. it would have been nice to see that on this show during the final 3 seasons. Yes, I realize ""Smallville"" is about Clark Kent, but since Green Arrow, Flash, and Aquaman were introduced, why not Bruce Wayne/Batman? It doesn't make sense.What an awful ending to such an amazing show. If I were part of the production department, this show would have rocked in seasons 8-10. Oh well, too bad for the producers/writers of ""Smallville"" seasons 8-10. Their mundane writing and production for this show during the last 3 seasons ruined this show.",2,What a huge disappointment,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,1924,"['Final', 'Season', 'Smallville', 'was', 'disappointment', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'describe', 'pathetic', 'miserable', 'season', 'was', 'First', 'off', 'having', 'almost', 'dead', 'characters', 'e.g', 'Lex', 'Lionel', 'Luthor', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'return', 'was', 'expected', 'were', 'integral', 'show', 'did', 'anyone', 'notice', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'did', 'not', 'return', 'final', 'season', 'episode', 'True', 'have', 'kryptonite', 'infused', 'body', 'show', 'least', 'show', 'distance', 'something', 'disappearance', 'final', 'episode', 'cast', 'dark', 'cloud', 'did', 'not', 'bring', 'resolution', 'show', 'Did', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'part', 'final', 'season/episode', 'Hmm', 'Second', 'villain', 'Darkseid', 'was', 'introduced', 'puff', 'black', 'smoke', 'Ridiculous', 'comics', 'animated', 'series', 'not', 'puff', 'black', 'smoke', 'gigantic', 'flesh', 'intimidating', 'introduce', 'Darkseid', 'puff', 'black', 'smoke', 'was', 'disrespectful', 'fans', 'legendary/cult', 'show', 'What', 'were', 'writers', 'smoking', 'wonder', 'Alfred', 'Gough', 'Miles', 'Millar', 'left', 'show', 'season', '7', 'Third', 'season', '10', 'as', 'well', 'season', '8', '9', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'Bruce', 'Wayne/Batman', 'character', 'was', 'introduced', 'just', 'most', 'other', 'Justice', 'League', 'members', 'were', 'introduced', 'Green', 'Lantern', 'Wonderwoman', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'have', 'history', 'comics/animated', 'films/etc', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'show', 'final', '3', 'seasons', 'Yes', 'realize', 'Smallville', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'Flash', 'Aquaman', 'were', 'introduced', 'why', 'not', 'Bruce', 'Wayne/Batman', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.What', 'awful', 'ending', 'amazing', 'show', 'were', 'part', 'production', 'department', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'rocked', 'seasons', '8-10', 'Oh', 'well', 'too', 'bad', 'producers/writers', 'Smallville', 'seasons', '8-10', 'mundane', 'writing', 'production', 'show', 'last', '3', 'seasons', 'ruined', 'show']",Smallville: The Final Season

DELETED SCENES3) SUPERGIRL: B ...Clark and Kara have a family reunion. Green Arrow reveals his identity not caring that his former love almost got killed protecting him. DELETED SCENES4) HOMECOMING: A++ ...The scenes taking place in the future and the barn scene make this episode one of the very best. However, Oliver's speech was moronic and hypocritical given that he's the one who made the conscious decision to ""step out of the shadows."" FEATURETTE5) ISIS: A ...The last fifteen minutes are DIAMOND-STUDDED GLORIOUS!!6) HARVEST: A ...From start to finish, this episode might have been taken right out of ""Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"" - only much, much sexier and with an edge.7) AMBUSH: A+ ...General Sam Lane played by the superb Michael Ironside arrives for Thanksgiving dinner. His idea for the Vigilante Registration Agency is actually what the Justice League will become in the future when Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman take over its leadership. The difference here is that Darkseid has agitated anti-hero sentiment allowing those who would enforce it to use it as a weapon.8) ABANDONED: A- ...Tess Mercer aka Lutessa Lena Luthor learns about her past. Lois and Clark's parents deliver touching messages through video recordings. DELETED SCENES9) PATRIOT: A- ...Directed by Tom Welling, Aquaman and wife Mera show Clark and Lois the advantage of allowing your best girl to be your best ally. General Slade becomes Deathstroke after a run-in with the Justice League.10) LUTHOR: B+ ...Welling in one of his most electrifying performances both as Kent and Luthor.11) ICARUS: A+ ...Hawkman and Deathstroke's fight scene is the finest choreographed of the series. In the last scene, everyone involved is at their most beautiful - especially Erica Durance who looks like Wonder Woman and Welling who looks like THE Superman.12) COLLATERAL: D+ ...Written by Jordan Hawley -it's hard to believe this is the same person who wrote the masterpiece that is The Rain Scene in last season's ""Rabid."" He ridiculously glorified chloe at everyone's expense and made Lois sound stupid considering that when she bashed the ""Tea Party"" she was bashing her own father. The only things worth watching here were Black Canary, the virtual flight scene and Clark and Lois' first and last scenes together. Everything else was trash.13) BEACON: D- ...Perry ""Bulldog"" White a she-man hippie? Ha! Yeah, right. With his classic choleric personality, he'd crash a war as an embedded journalist getting the stories first hand and not accepting anyone's spin on a story except his own. Hippies were not rebels. They were lazy, horny, dope-addicted cowards who started the ""make love not war"" hypocrisy just to avoid the draft. Notice they didn't have a problem sending others to war when they got into power (Bill Clinton, anyone?). They glorify JFK yet they conveniently forget that he's the one who got us involved in the Vietnam War in the first place. Ghandi, MLK Jr., the American revolutionists of the 18th century- they were genuine and admirable rebels. This makes two lousy episodes in a row that Lois is written out of character. She is not an unperceptive insecure feminazi. Lois Lane has been a strong, intelligent, confident, independent yet at her core (like Superman) passionate, loving, iconic gentlewoman for over seven decades so her scene with Martha Kent made no sense at all especially since they've known each other for years and Lois is the reason Martha's even in politics. Their interaction in ""Hostage"" was so much more natural. Welling's distraction for his other project really showed in this episode. At least the fan videos were nice. I liked the one sent in by the soldier. Other than that, this wasn't worth the time. DELETED SCENES14) MASQUERADE: B- ...Ah, what a breath of fresh air it was to see MY Lois again after two miserable episodes. And Mr.Kent? Sexy, sexy, SEXY! It was so GOOD to see/hear their classic, hilarious, pure gold banter again! Downside: Episodes 12-15 shaped up to be chloe's Arc of Suck. At least this time, the iconic duo weren't completely sidelined.15) FORTUNE: C ...Bursts of hilarity(courtesy of Emil-Elvis/Tess duet,drunken Clark,Oliver in drag)mixed with the Smallville writers' pathetic and very desperate attempt to cannonize themselves through their creation:chloe sullivan. They had her outright declare herself the ""king maker"" in being THE ONE who inspires Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman to greatness? I'd get mad at this if it wasn't so sad and ridiculous. Writers who can't exercise objectivity when the outcome of the story is on the line have no business being producers. Lois/Clark's eventual wedding was a payoff for stomaching all the shams: Lex/lana, chloe and the two cannon characters she had no business messing with. Because of her one ended up dead, the other with a dark mark and away from his destined true love. Seriously, if I were a family member of the creators of ""the big 3"" I'd sue them for disrespecting 7 decades of hard work by thousands of artists and craftsmen and the millions of fans who supported them. MUSIC VIDEO16) SCION: D ...Besides giving Lionel a well deserved all around smack-down, there wasn't a point here that piqued interest. His re-introduction in ""Luthor"" was tantalizing but it turned out to be a DUD - as did the ""Lex clone."" A couple of scenes were just WRONG on so many levels. Definitely one of the worst stories of the series. It's like they tried to sneak in a pilot for a spin-off but it just fell apart into an unentertaining and somewhat disturbing mess. DELETED SCENES17) KENT: B- ...Where ""Luthor"" was better done focusing on the family as a whole, ""Kent"" was lopsided in that the focus was the Kent Farm, not the family itself. It also focused too much on the Luthors again.18) BOOSTER: A++ ...EXCELLENCE PERSONIFIED - BEST EPISODE OF THE SEASON AND THE SERIES. If this show were to have any kind of spin-off, I'd want it to be just like this. Written by DC Comics executive Geoff Johns and directed by executive producer/star Tom Welling, this is the only episode where only two regular cast members (Welling and Durance) appear. Handsome Eric Martsolf was born to play Booster Gold. Welling ends his Smallville directing career with IMPRESSIVE ECSTATIC SUPERMANLY FLAIR!19) DOMINION: C- ...Cheesy and predictable. The ""gladiator"" fight scenes were very funny, though - they looked like skinny spoofs of Conan the barbarian in slow motion. But at least it did (clumsily) move the story along and it was nice to see Callum Blue again albeit, clearly, not his best performance. COMMENTARY20) PROPHECY: B- ...The ""crazy quilt"" of the season. Very nice moments sewn into a tapestry of visually rich scenes framed in stunning fashion. But, there was much, too, too much jammed into one single episode without proper exploration leaving one dissatisfied. Case in point:Kara's (Laura Vandervoort's) departure. It was an ill-conceived stunt even when DC allowed it in Justice League Unlimited. Perhaps, it was no accident that Season 9 (despite its plotholes)remained the greatest, most tightly executed season in the series' entire ten-year run AND it was also the one and ONLY season when Welling was fully engaged as star/producer the entire year (come season 10, his producing time was cut in half due to his ""Glee knock-off"" dramedy). Absent Welling's undivided attention to detail, 10 fell prey to the typical pitfalls of seasons 1-8: strong first half (and 10 did have the strongest ever) followed by a second half full of anti-climactic non-resolutions, strong story lines shamefully rushed, glossed over while weak and Superman-irreleveant arcs were wasted over several episodes.21) (WEDDING)FINALE PART 1: A++ ...The last episode filmed (as Part 2 was filmed third to last). It explains why most of the cast members seemed so genuinely emotional - in the barn, the door scene and then the wedding. They were tenderly staged and photographed - simple, elegant... beautiful.22) (SUPERMAN)FINALE PART 2: A++ ...For once, Ausiello was wrong and they stuck with ""finale"" as the official title. Just as well. For me, it confirms that the writers were never interested in telling Superman stories, only in using his fame to promote their show. Welling punked out. He did not wear the suit. The Fortress sequence was thrilling but after that, it was just close-ups of his face and an all CGI caricature. Still, the final 2 and 1/2 minutes were... PERFECT. Or, as perfect as this show ever got.I'll remember it as ""the Superman show that wasn't about Superman."" Thanks to certain elements though, Smallville's decathlon held glimpses of genuine cinematic greatness (if only Welling had the guts to follow completely through). All in all, it was an often interesting (when Clark and his Lois were the focus), at times too far-fetched (superlana and Black Canary-wannabe shortkick chloe) and needlessly melodramatic (lana seasons 3-8, chloe seasons 6-10, oliver season 10 and the stupid clark,lex,lana triangle seasons 5-8) but because of its source origin (and in spite of its  writers/producers), always hopeful decade - not because we want/need to believe in heroes but because there ARE heroes regardless of wether we believe in them or not. And, when these heroes' deeds eventually touch our lives, they inspire us to create new ones and become them ourselves. Writers come and go but Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster's original Superman vision shines as bright as always. 73 years and counting... he still stands for Truth, Justice and the American Way.

1351888,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B003L77GG0,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[78, 90]","MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOWThe tenth season of ""Smallville"" is a tremendous ride to a stirring final episode.  It is a great sendoff overall for what is arguably the finest television series of its entire genre.Beginning with ""Lazarus,"" the season propels Clark on a fantastic journey. Pulled back from death in the season premiere by Lois Lane, the love of his life, Clark must face a freakishly cloned Lex Luthor, played extremely well in the premiere by Mackenzie Gray.  Additionally, Clark must contend with the knowledge that an evil supernatural being known as Darkseid threatens to dominate the Earth.  John Schneider also returns in the first episode as Johnathan Kent, Clark's departed Earthly father, now a spirit guide for him.The season's second episode ""Shield,"" is an important show for the Suicide Squad, Amanda Waller's corrupt fighting force.  The group of radically violent superhero supporters comes to the forefront as the primary villains in the early half of the season.  The show also introduces the ""Smallville"" iteration of Cat Grant, a latter-day ""Superman"" character whom I first became familiar with through ""Lois and Clark:  The New Adventures of Superman.""  Played by actress Keri Lynn Pratt, she is fairly annoying but essentially has good intentions.This season also features the series' landmark 200th episode, an absolute gem called ""Homecoming.""  The return of James Marsters as Brainiac 5 heralds a stunning trip through time for Clark.  An important component of emotional peace and closure regarding Johnathan's death finally gives Clark a mature philosophical base for true love with Lois Lane.  Unfortunately, the very next episode ""Isis"" is one of the few true low points of the season, a head-scratching show whose storyline is random and pointless.  It mostly exists to drag a fringe superhero into the show but does have a moment of redemption at its conclusion.When ""Smallville"" premiered in 2001, its premise and promise was the journey of the hero Clark Kent and the future villain Lex Luthor.  As with any long-running TV series, cast members gradually left ""Smallville,"" even including the show's original mature Lex Luthor, Michael Rosenbaum.  To the immense credit of the series' creative staff, the overall story arc was wisely altered slightly, to both keep the name Lex Luthor viable in the series and make room for a charismatic female antihero named Tess Mercer.  Cassidy Freeman contributes depth and ultimately compassion as a multifaceted actress, and has a very rich character arc in the final season.  Lex Luthor is kept viable this season through a series of clones, ironically at first nurtured in secret by Tess.  I can forgive an absurd contrivance to bring the deceased Lionel Luthor back to life in the episode ""Luthor.""  The show is one of the best of the season, and John Glover's devilishly cold acting approach to Lionel Luthor is, technically speaking, the work of a master.Episode highlights are ""Homecoming,"" ""Ambush,"" ""Abandoned,"" ""Icarus,"" ""Shield,"" ""Patriot,"" ""Lazarus,"" and the series finale, a two-hour masterpiece entitled simply ""Finale.""The finale is a thoughtful romp through ten years of series backstory, thematically exploring the character of Clark Kent in its first half and revealing the character of Superman in its second half.  The Darkseid storyline comes to a gruesome head and original series stars Tom Welling and Michael Rosenbaum fulfill the series' intial promise.  A brilliant storytelling balance highlighting the marriage of Clark and Lois and the full emergence of Superman juxtaposed against a monstrous dark turn for both Lionel and Lex sets the perfect tone for the series' conclusion.I love ""Smallville.""  Over its time on the air, it has become one of my favorite television shows of all time.  Thank you to the cast and crew through all ten years, and to original series creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar.

1351891,A1W9QAR7P545IC,B003L77GG0,iMike,"[8, 10]","This review is more for season 10 itself.  I think after nine seasons, after starting off in one place and really taking the series (and its characters) to places fans probably never thought it/they would go, expectations for the tenth season were undoubtedly sky high and in my opinion that's why a lot of people have given some negative reviews about some parts of the season.  The only episode I allowed myself to have any real expectation for was ""Finale.""  I've been through this before; The seventh season of 'Charmed' and a good portion of season eight was fantastic, but my expectations to tie up so many loose ends that final season let me down.  Same with Buffy and Angel ... So I promised myself I would not create any expectations in my mind of what the final season should be.  I approached it like it was not the final season.Doing that allowed me to enjoy each episode (some were not as good, admittedly, but every season of every show has its weaker episodes).  I'll give the writers and producers (and especially the cast) credit; they really do CRAM A LOT in these twenty-one episodes (""Finale"" is two hours).  Annette O'Toole and John Schneider (Martha and Jonathan Kent) make touching returns; John Glover's return is absolutely chilling as he reinvents Lionel as a nemesis, not the soft(er)-hearted sometimes-villain he had become prior to falling to his death at the end of the seventh season.  James Marsters rocked as Brainiac 5, and Laura Vandervoort's episode, though one of the weaker of the season, showed a Kara that had grown since we'd seen her last.  Callum Blue's return as Zod (who know ruled the Phantom Zone) was one of my favorites.  Appearances in ""Finale"" by Michael Rosenbaum (always fabulous as Lex Luthor) and Aaron Ashmore as the real Jimmy Olson.  Most of all I was happy Allison Mack came back for six episodes, book-ending the season with Chloe sacrificing herself to save Oliver and playing a solid role in the finale, as it should have been.  I'll admit I was a bit ticked that Mack did not sign on as a regular for the full season, especially considering she was lasted longer than any other cast member on the show (except Tom Welling, of course), but ultimately I think it was fitting.  After years of taking a back seat to Kristin Kreuk's Lana Lang, Mack really proved her worth during seasons eight and nine as the show's female lead.  Chloe Sullivan had more real character development in those two seasons than seasons five, six, and seven combined.  It was fitting, though, that she step aside and hand the role of female lead to Erica Durance (the best Lois Lane ever, in my opinion) for the final season.  Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen) and Cassidy Freeman (Tess Mercer) were brilliant in their roles; Freeman really rocked this season and held her own in a scenes with with Michael Rosenbaum and John Glover.Though seasons eight and nine are my favorite, season ten is awesome and I highly recommend it.",5,"A Solid, Yet Sometimes Rocky Season.",1319760000,"10 28, 2011",2011,2961,"['review', 'more', 'season', '10', 'think', 'nine', 'seasons', 'starting', 'off', 'one', 'place', 'really', 'taking', 'series', 'characters', 'places', 'fans', 'probably', 'never', 'thought', 'it/they', 'would', 'go', 'expectations', 'tenth', 'season', 'were', 'undoubtedly', 'sky', 'high', 'opinion', 'why', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'given', 'negative', 'reviews', 'parts', 'season', 'only', 'episode', 'allowed', 'have', 'real', 'expectation', 'was', 'Finale', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seventh', 'season', ""'Charmed"", 'good', 'portion', 'season', 'eight', 'was', 'fantastic', 'expectations', 'tie', 'up', 'so', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'final', 'season', 'let', 'down', 'Same', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'So', 'promised', 'would', 'not', 'create', 'expectations', 'mind', 'what', 'final', 'season', 'should', 'be', 'approached', 'was', 'not', 'final', 'season.Doing', 'allowed', 'enjoy', 'episode', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'admittedly', 'season', 'show', 'weaker', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'give', 'writers', 'producers', 'especially', 'cast', 'credit', 'really', 'do', 'CRAM', 'A', 'LOT', 'twenty-one', 'episodes', 'Finale', 'two', 'hours', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'John', 'Schneider', 'Martha', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'make', 'touching', 'returns', 'John', 'Glover', 'return', 'absolutely', 'chilling', 'Lionel', 'nemesis', 'not', 'soft', 'er', '-hearted', 'sometimes-villain', 'had', 'become', 'prior', 'falling', 'death', 'end', 'seventh', 'season', 'James', 'Marsters', 'rocked', 'Brainiac', '5', 'Laura', 'Vandervoort', 'episode', 'one', 'weaker', 'season', 'showed', 'Kara', 'had', 'grown', ""'d"", 'seen', 'last', 'Callum', 'Blue', 'return', 'Zod', 'who', 'know', 'ruled', 'Phantom', 'Zone', 'was', 'one', 'favorites', 'Appearances', 'Finale', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'always', 'fabulous', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Aaron', 'Ashmore', 'real', 'Jimmy', 'Olson', 'Most', 'was', 'happy', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'came', 'back', 'six', 'episodes', 'book-ending', 'season', 'Chloe', 'sacrificing', 'save', 'Oliver', 'playing', 'solid', 'role', 'finale', 'should', 'have', 'been', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'bit', 'ticked', 'Mack', 'did', 'not', 'sign', 'regular', 'full', 'season', 'especially', 'considering', 'was', 'lasted', 'longer', 'other', 'cast', 'member', 'show', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'course', 'ultimately', 'think', 'was', 'fitting', 'years', 'taking', 'back', 'seat', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Mack', 'really', 'proved', 'worth', 'seasons', 'eight', 'nine', 'show', 'female', 'lead', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan', 'had', 'more', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'two', 'seasons', 'seasons', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'combined', 'was', 'fitting', 'though', 'step', 'aside', 'hand', 'role', 'female', 'lead', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'best', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'ever', 'opinion', 'final', 'season', 'Justin', 'Hartley', 'Oliver', 'Queen', 'Cassidy', 'Freeman', 'Tess', 'Mercer', 'were', 'brilliant', 'roles', 'Freeman', 'really', 'rocked', 'season', 'held', 'own', 'scenes', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'John', 'Glover.Though', 'seasons', 'eight', 'nine', 'are', 'favorite', 'season', 'ten', 'awesome', 'highly', 'recommend']",Smallville: The Final Season
1351892,A3D5UHUD1CMTXG,B003L77GG0,"Jacki ""Jack Mueller""","[7, 49]","It's official, Smallville butchered Superman.The series stuck to its original goal of preventing Clark from becoming the Man of Steel for as long as possible. And when he finally does change, the scene are the worst Superman scenes to be filmed. There's only two maybe three shots of Tom Welling in the suit and the rest of the time Superman is shown in a far away shot done with incredibly poor computer animation.The series decided to do its own version of Superman saving an airplane and its absolutely pathetic. The film Superman Returns has a far superior scene and it even won several awards for it. But that's because that film was actually done by Superman fans and by people who had actually read the comics. Smallville clearly isn't done by Superman fans and they maybe have read about ten issues, and obviously hated them. Hence the reason why Smallville stays away from Superman for so long and doesn't even give the characters their original names.The Blur? Velocity? What stupid names to give Superman and The Flash.Now what really is awful about the finale is how it ends. Lex is barely in it, and maybe the actor had two, three days of filming. (but more than likely just one.) And Clark doesn't even fight Lex or Darkside. I was at least expecting a fight scene between the those two once Clark became Superman, but no he just moves the fire ball away in the last ten minutes of an hour and half show. The whole episode is horrible and boring because most of it is Clark and Lois complaining about getting married and complaining about their futures. Boring!Now if people really want to see a good version of Superman, check out the animated films from DC Animated Warner Studios. Those films are marvelous, stay true to the comics, get PG-13 ratings because of all the action, and they show why cartoons are the best way to deliver comic books as movies.

Sure there were ups and down, the worst being the doldrums of the mid-series' Lex and Lana years (such a waste of Rosenbaum) but overall this has been spectacular. I grew up reading Superman comics and watching various TV and film adaptations and as much as I loved Christopher Reeve as Superman I have to say this series is the best take on the mythos - and I just spent the last few months watching Smallville from start to finish. Every show has it's dogs, but when Smallville was firing on all cylinders it was spectacular TV. And since this is the set-up to a boy becoming a man it truly is the journey and not the destination that is important. We all have our quibbles, I would have preferred Zod or Lex being the main villain in the final season, but when you see most of the abysmal dreck churned out on TV these days I'm happy with what we got here.

It was still in my top five until season 8. And to my surprise, I still liked it after Lex left. But by season 9, it had run out of steam... and they just kept right on going. And that gets my goat a little. Most of this season seems like filler for the finale. I watched this season to see Clark become Superman. But that last episode is mostly Lois and Clark deciding if they are going to get married or not. Like some cheesy romance show. It's like they forgot who the original audience for the show was - largely young males. Then, to top it off, you don't even really get a good look at Welling as Superman. I personally felt robbed.

1351901,A294HSVTOCR5L4,B003L77GG0,Jeffrey C. Meade,"[0, 0]","Season 10 in some ways brings back some of what was lost over the last couple of seasons (so far). Smallville was getting boring and bland with forgettable episodes spaced in between the main storyline. The climax of Season 8 with Doomsday was so disappointing after a season that you were sure was going to lead to a finale that was spectacular. Zod in season 9 was a better season finale, but was an annoying character that wasn't fully realized and you found that you just didn't care.Now we get to season 10, the final year, and we are seeing some of the old Smallville again. Some old characters are coming back and there's so far only one episode that I found boring and a reminder of the last couple of seasons. The creators of the show know this is the last hurrah and as the season plays out you are seeing more and more of that as they go down paths that they probably wouldn't have tried in earlier seasons.The fight scenes still are a weak point, which is the way its always been, with only a few exceptions. Its a tv show with a limited budget so unfortunately we usually don't get to see Clark kick ass as much as we would like to.I'm personally happier that Chloe is out of the picture. The show seems to have improved with her character out of the way. Lois is still a great character and now that she knows about Clark that has made the story so much better. Ive always liked Green Arrow, though sometimes it feels like they want him to be a main character in the show, but they don't always know what to do with him. I like Tess Mercer far more in season 10 than I did in earlier seasons. She was very annoying early on, but has developed into something very important to the show.I do wish we had more interactions with other super heroes. They seem to show up infrequently here and there and nothing much seems to happen when you are really expecting some bad ass fight when you get these people together. I'm still looking forward to a big Justice League fight with as many of the good guys as they can shove into one episodeWhile there has not really been anything stated, you can see season 10 leading up to the return of Lex Luthor as the final showdown.Season 10 is definitely better than 8 or 9, and even some of 7, but this series really needs to go out with a bang.

1351906,A1NLVNEXPGUOVO,B003L77GG0,"Jim ""Jim""","[4, 5]","This was a muddled finale season to an otherwise strong series.  After an amazing Season 8 and 9 with Doomsday and Zod, the overarching plot theme this season is a mysterious darkness that must be battled.  Not fully developed, this darkness randomly overtakes people and turns them evil against their will.  The evil's final action is oddly disconnected from every episode in the season, and the evil earthly minions are killed rather easily in the finale (super lame).  Allison Mack as Chloe Sullivan is in only a handful of episodes, and her presence is sorely missed.  The ongoing thread of the anti-vigilante movement doesn't make sense AT ALL because the heroes are saving people, not taking criminal justice into their own hands.  The writers work hard to try to make it work throughout the entire season, but it simply doesn't.  Like the darkness theme, you just have to pretend it works and move on.  The whole second Lionel plot is also super ridiculous.On the positive side of some lame plots, it's fun to see so many actors returning (why no redemption for Pete Ross, however?), particularly Annette O'Toole and John Schneider.  There are some outstanding episodes among the mix (the one where Lois gets caught in a cult is really fun), and there are elements to the finale episode that wrap things up nicely.It's also worth noting, for people of faith out there, that the writers take on a decidedly anti-Catholic/Christian perspective in this season and push it from beginning to end.  I'm not talking about them taking a stance again religion but attacking their followers.  One ongoing villain is named Godfrey, and his biggest supporter listens to Amy Grant and is perpetually perky.  The Darkness has chosen ones that he chooses for himself to live eternally after the darkness ""rapture"" day.  That's a short list.  In thinking of people I know, it was more than mildly offensive.Overall, this isn't the worst season of SMALLLVILLE (skip Season 4 entirely), but after the build-up of Seasons 8 and 9, it's disappointing.  At the same time, if you've been with the series through the good and the bad, you'll want to see this final season even though it is one of the weaker ones.",3,Disappointing End to an Overall Strong Series,1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,2197,"['was', 'muddled', 'finale', 'season', 'otherwise', 'strong', 'series', 'amazing', 'Season', '8', '9', 'Doomsday', 'Zod', 'overarching', 'plot', 'theme', 'season', 'mysterious', 'darkness', 'must', 'be', 'battled', 'Not', 'fully', 'developed', 'darkness', 'randomly', 'people', 'evil', 'will', 'evil', 'final', 'action', 'oddly', 'disconnected', 'episode', 'season', 'evil', 'earthly', 'minions', 'are', 'killed', 'rather', 'easily', 'finale', 'super', 'lame', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan', 'only', 'handful', 'episodes', 'presence', 'sorely', 'missed', 'ongoing', 'thread', 'anti-vigilante', 'movement', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'AT', 'ALL', 'heroes', 'are', 'saving', 'people', 'not', 'taking', 'criminal', 'justice', 'own', 'hands', 'writers', 'work', 'hard', 'try', 'make', 'work', 'entire', 'season', 'simply', ""n't"", 'darkness', 'theme', 'just', 'have', 'pretend', 'move', 'whole', 'second', 'Lionel', 'plot', 'also', 'super', 'positive', 'side', 'lame', 'plots', 'fun', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'returning', 'why', 'redemption', 'Pete', 'Ross', 'however', 'particularly', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'John', 'Schneider', 'are', 'outstanding', 'episodes', 'mix', 'one', 'where', 'Lois', 'caught', 'cult', 'really', 'fun', 'are', 'elements', 'finale', 'episode', 'wrap', 'things', 'up', 'nicely.It', 'also', 'worth', 'noting', 'people', 'faith', 'there', 'writers', 'take', 'decidedly', 'anti-Catholic/Christian', 'perspective', 'season', 'push', 'beginning', 'end', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'taking', 'stance', 'again', 'religion', 'attacking', 'followers', 'One', 'ongoing', 'villain', 'named', 'Godfrey', 'biggest', 'supporter', 'listens', 'Amy', 'Grant', 'perpetually', 'perky', 'Darkness', 'chosen', 'ones', 'live', 'eternally', 'darkness', 'rapture', 'day', 'short', 'list', 'thinking', 'people', 'know', 'was', 'more', 'mildly', 'offensive.Overall', ""n't"", 'worst', 'season', 'SMALLLVILLE', 'skip', 'Season', '4', 'entirely', 'build-up', 'Seasons', '8', '9', 'disappointing', 'same', 'time', ""'ve"", 'been', 'series', 'good', 'bad', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'final', 'season', 'even', 'one', 'weaker', 'ones']",Smallville: The Final Season

Both of my orders arrived in the same box from Amazon an hour ago and I performed a quick A-B comparison of the opening scene from the last episode ""Finale"" in addition to the 3 special features included as part of the Season 10 release to determine the amount of difference both visually and sonically.Having watched the original CW broadcasts in HD, the Blu-ray version is far superior viewing experience.  This is particularly evident in the medium and wider master shots, black level detail (crushes more on the DVD's) with a much more expansive sound stage (5.1 DTS HD Master Audio on the Blu-rays verses 5.1 Dobly Digital on the DVD's) offering much more enveloping atmospherics with cleaner, more distinct vocals.  By comparison, in addition to the expected lower picture resolution, the sound field is much more biased to the front sound stage with voices recorded at a lower comparable volume level sounding slightly compressed on the DVD's verses the Blu-ray's.Smallville: The Complete Seriesultimately is a very impressive series package featuring exceptionally well done content (will take some time to read all 16 pages of the Daily Planet) that I already feel was well worth the money even if I haven't yet had the time to view any of it yet.  I understand Warner's decision concerning the reasons why this was not released on Blu-ray.  As you view the special features (especially the one on the 200th episode ""Homecoming""), the difference between the clips from most recent shows along with the interviews shot for the Season 10 Special Features (10801/24p except the music video & deleted scenes which are 480i/60) when it jumps to scenes from the earlier years is quiet distinct visually.  The latter lacks sharpest, color clarity/depth even on Blu-ray.If one were to use Star Trek-The Next Generation as a gauge for a studio going back (18 years in 2012 since it ended in 1994!) and investing the money to re-comp all of the special effects to bring it up to the level of Blu-ray, will I still be around or care in 2029.  If you've been a dedicated fan of Smallville whether recently such as myself or from the very beginning in 2001, either theSmallville: The Complete Tenth Season [Blu-ray] or the complete series should satisfy.  While the ultimate value choice is for each to make, I have no regrets completing my collection even if 5 of the seasons were double dipped as the extras on theSmallville: The Complete Seriesappear to be exceptionally well worth the money spent.",5,Quick First Impressions:  Blu-ray outshines DVD's from The Complete Series,1322524800,"11 29, 2011",2011,2700,"['Perhaps', 'might', 'help', 'should', 'be', 'considering', 'acquiring', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'ofSmallville', 'Complete', 'Tenth', 'Season', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'addition', 'lieu', 'purchasingSmallville', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Both', 'orders', 'arrived', 'same', 'box', 'Amazon', 'hour', 'performed', 'quick', 'A-B', 'comparison', 'opening', 'scene', 'last', 'episode', 'Finale', 'addition', '3', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'part', 'Season', '10', 'release', 'determine', 'amount', 'difference', 'visually', 'sonically.Having', 'watched', 'original', 'CW', 'broadcasts', 'HD', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'far', 'superior', 'viewing', 'experience', 'particularly', 'evident', 'medium', 'wider', 'master', 'shots', 'black', 'level', 'detail', 'crushes', 'more', 'DVD', 'much', 'more', 'expansive', 'sound', 'stage', '5.1', 'DTS', 'HD', 'Master', 'Audio', 'Blu-rays', 'verses', '5.1', 'Dobly', 'Digital', 'DVD', 'offering', 'much', 'more', 'enveloping', 'atmospherics', 'cleaner', 'more', 'distinct', 'vocals', 'comparison', 'addition', 'expected', 'lower', 'picture', 'resolution', 'sound', 'field', 'much', 'more', 'biased', 'front', 'sound', 'stage', 'voices', 'recorded', 'lower', 'comparable', 'volume', 'level', 'sounding', 'slightly', 'compressed', 'DVD', ""Blu-ray's.Smallville"", 'Complete', 'Seriesultimately', 'very', 'impressive', 'series', 'package', 'featuring', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'content', 'will', 'take', 'time', 'read', '16', 'pages', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'already', 'feel', 'was', 'well', 'money', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'had', 'time', 'view', 'yet', 'understand', 'Warner', 'decision', 'concerning', 'reasons', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'Blu-ray', 'view', 'special', 'features', 'especially', 'one', '200th', 'episode', 'Homecoming', 'difference', 'clips', 'most', 'recent', 'shows', 'interviews', 'shot', 'Season', '10', 'Special', 'Features', '10801/24p', 'music', 'video', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', '480i/60', 'when', 'scenes', 'earlier', 'years', 'quiet', 'distinct', 'visually', 'latter', 'lacks', 'sharpest', 'color', 'clarity/depth', 'even', 'Blu-ray.If', 'one', 'were', 'use', 'Star', 'Trek-The', 'Next', 'Generation', 'gauge', 'studio', 'going', 'back', '18', 'years', '2012', 'ended', '1994', 'investing', 'money', 're-comp', 'special', 'effects', 'bring', 'up', 'level', 'Blu-ray', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'around', 'care', '2029', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dedicated', 'fan', 'Smallville', 'recently', 'such', 'very', 'beginning', '2001', 'theSmallville', 'Complete', 'Tenth', 'Season', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'complete', 'series', 'should', 'satisfy', 'ultimate', 'value', 'choice', 'make', 'have', 'regrets', 'completing', 'collection', 'even', '5', 'seasons', 'were', 'double', 'dipped', 'extras', 'theSmallville', 'Complete', 'Seriesappear', 'be', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'money', 'spent']",Smallville: The Final Season

They usually release Smallville in September, if someone can tell me why I would greatly appreciate it. However Samllville was one of the best shows on television along with Supernatural, Psych, and Mad Men in my opinion. As a Superman collector for years and years I was very happy that this show was able to wrap things up without being cut short. Smallville quite frankly means a lot to me and I refuse to believe that one season was better than another, it's a very large character arc and some lulls are to be expected when a character is developed from beginning to end (or at least the end of that particular chapter of development). Even after Michael Rosenbaum left the show after season seven they didn't panic, they still worked hard and gave it's audience something worth their time.The only thing I wish they had done and I know that it was impossible but I would have loved to have seen it at least once would have been Clark meeting a young Bruce Wayne. I just think that would have been really really awesome, but it wasn't possible and I'm not sure it would have worked in the plot line. Tom Welling will forever be my envisionment of Superman/Clark Kent and he even without being a hardcore fan of the Superman mythos just continually knocked it out of the park episode after episode. I would just like to say thanks to him for being awesome.The real reason you would want to buy this is simply to finish your consumption of an epic story, a transformation from man to legend, from hero to superhero. I wasn't sure how they were going to tie up everything after ten years worth of plot to integrate into two hours but they succeeded in grandiose fashion and I wasn't even slightly disappointed.

Thinking it was a show for teenagers, I avoided it altogether during it`s entire run.I purchased season 10 and expected to be let down and have a couple of laughs.  Watching Tom Welling as the title character, I was quite surprised that he came off as sincere and genuine.  I just hope his fame in this decade long story doesn't go to his head and spoil his performance in any future projects.  He should have been The Man of Steel in the new film.  Why he or the producers didn't choose him, I don't know.  Perhaps he fears typecasting.  Tom has a sensitivity and humanity that I haven't seen in any of the recent actors.  The actor in Bryan Singer's film and the new one for Zack Snyder's  adaptation look very pale in comparison.I was impressed with the array of super characters in the show. If it wasn't for the ""meteor freaks"" there wouldn't be much in the way of adversaries for Superman to battle.  I did miss the presence of Lex Luthor in this season up until we see him in the series finale.  If there is a Smallville movie; the actor who plays Lex Luthor, Michael Rosenbaum, has to be part of it.  If  you a fan of Superman, you've got to check this out.  It's because of this season, I am ordering the remaining nine seasons to watch.  It's a keeper! It's the kind of show that rewards the viewer with multiple viewings.

Batty,"[9, 15]","Rather like the make-it-up-as-you-go-along shows ""The X-Files,"" and ""Lost,"" it's obvious that the ""Smallville"" creators never expected this series to last more than a couple of seasons at best.  By season 10 Smallville and the Kent farm are not much more than a place to feed the dog and stare out toward the heavens from the hay loft of the barn.  From the beginning the series made the bold (and not necessarily wise) decision to discount the existing Superman myth and create a soap opera that would focus on entertaining young teens.  Once it was clear that this excursion would have little (or nothing) to do with the comic book character, I just went along for the ride, finding some episodes worthwhile and others close to embarrassing.  We find strange, distorted personifications of the Martian Manhunter, Green Arrow, Aquaman, Supergirl, select members of the JLA, etc., with the stitching for all frayed and generally disappointing.  Like so many other successful programs, ""Smallville"" did its best to fill the unexpected void opened up to the producers, cast, crew and scriptwriters.  Sometimes I really wanted to shame the writers for their staggering lack of imagination and reliance on older, staid sci fi material.  Since the series cowered away from turning Kal El into the ultimate superhero for years, we were always left with a kind of quasi-Superman, emotionally unbalanced, unfocused, and ignorant of his role as a self-sacrificing hero.

B Merhar ""A Cliffhanger Collector""","[3, 5]","If you are looking for the well written, well produced, and well directed episodes from the early years of this acclaimed series you probably won't find it in this loose collection of bizarre fairy tales.This great series, which I anticipated with each new week, has taken a serious tumble in this jumble of nonsensical short stories. Many are rehashes of stories already told (must have run out of new ideas) and very few afford us more than a brief 45 minute glimpse, which ultimately provides the viewer with a shallow, under-developed story that is way too short to provide any depth to the characters or meaning to the story.  Previous years saw running story lines from one episode to the next that provided us with all the information we needed to become immersed in the story line and the characters, but this season seemed to be produced more for quantity and less for quality (courtesy of Mr. Welling who was the executive producer for the entire season).Some of the ideas were just plain dumb,like the episode etitled ""Granny Goodness"", who appears as an evil and sinister old lady who is into S&M; and keeps a bevy of scantilly clad ""torture girls who are into martial arts"".  I know this series is based on a comic book but this is lowering the bar too far.Now for the biggest disappointment! If you, like I, have been watching this series faithfully and anticipating the moment when Clark actully learns to fly, then brace yourself for a quick three seconds of an ""animated"" sequence of a small indistinguishable figure zipping through the far horizon.If you are a completist you definitely should purchase the collection, but do so knowing that if you enjoyed the series as much as I did, this season may not meet the high expectations it used to deserve.On a positive note I enjoyed seeing Lex again (the show was never the same after he departed) but even he couldn't measure up to his old evil ways in the few minutes afforded him in the final episode.Great series, very weak final season!",2,Where's The Beef?,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,2007,"['are', 'looking', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'produced', 'well', 'directed', 'episodes', 'early', 'years', 'acclaimed', 'series', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'loose', 'collection', 'bizarre', 'fairy', 'tales.This', 'great', 'series', 'anticipated', 'new', 'week', 'taken', 'serious', 'tumble', 'jumble', 'nonsensical', 'short', 'stories', 'Many', 'are', 'rehashes', 'stories', 'already', 'told', 'must', 'have', 'run', 'new', 'ideas', 'very', 'few', 'afford', 'more', 'brief', '45', 'minute', 'glimpse', 'ultimately', 'viewer', 'shallow', 'under-developed', 'story', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'provide', 'depth', 'characters', 'meaning', 'story', 'Previous', 'years', 'saw', 'running', 'story', 'lines', 'one', 'episode', 'next', 'provided', 'information', 'needed', 'become', 'immersed', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'season', 'seemed', 'be', 'produced', 'more', 'quantity', 'less', 'quality', 'courtesy', 'Mr.', 'Welling', 'who', 'was', 'executive', 'producer', 'entire', 'season', '.Some', 'ideas', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb', 'episode', 'etitled', 'Granny', 'Goodness', 'who', 'evil', 'sinister', 'old', 'lady', 'who', 'S', 'M', 'bevy', 'scantilly', 'clad', 'torture', 'girls', 'who', 'are', 'martial', 'arts', 'know', 'series', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'lowering', 'bar', 'too', 'far.Now', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'series', 'faithfully', 'anticipating', 'moment', 'when', 'Clark', 'actully', 'fly', 'then', 'brace', 'quick', 'three', 'seconds', 'animated', 'sequence', 'small', 'indistinguishable', 'figure', 'zipping', 'far', 'horizon.If', 'are', 'completist', 'definitely', 'should', 'purchase', 'collection', 'do', 'so', 'knowing', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'season', 'may', 'not', 'meet', 'high', 'expectations', 'used', 'deserve.On', 'positive', 'note', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'Lex', 'again', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'same', 'departed', 'even', 'could', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'old', 'evil', 'ways', 'few', 'minutes', 'afforded', 'final', 'episode.Great', 'series', 'very', 'weak', 'final', 'season']",Smallville: The Final Season

Clark Kent (Tom Welling) has come along way since his teenage years in Smallville High, and after years of struggling with the transition from boyhood to adulthood and forging his superhero identity, he is ready to jump into the spotlight as Earth's greatest protector. Unfortunately, a mysterious dark force has arisen, corrupting the minds of the populace and putting Clark and other superheroes in danger. With the help of Lois Lane (Erica Durance), Supergirl (Laura Vandervoort), the Justice League and his adoptive father Jonathan Kent (John Schneider), Clark will find the strength to overcome the darkness and embrace his fate. Smallville is the popular live-action comic book series that follows the adventures of a young Clark Kent during the years before he becomes Superman. The tenth and final season is somewhat uneven, but still offers a satisfying finale to one of the longest running television series. The final season also marks the return of many popular characters including arch nemesis Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) and amusing appearances of other DC characters.The Blu-Ray edition of Smallville: The Complete Tenth Season won't be the highlight of your Blu-Ray collection, but fans of Smallville will be pleasantly pleased with its presentation and content. All 22 episodes of the final season are presented in 1.78 widescreen format. The picture quality surpasses those of previous high definition ""Smallville"" releases with its bright colors and solid contrast.

Thornhill,"[12, 40]","I used to like watching this series early on, when it had stories in it, before the endless sad futility of the Lana Lang romance wore me out... Thought I'd give this last season a try, see if it all came to anything. And what I found was a travesty. Whole episodes seem to consist of characters pretentiously declaiming abstract profundities like, ""In order to live in the present, I need to let go of the past, dad. That means I have to say goodbye to you."" It seems as if the whole story is taking place on some level of vapid commentary. They forgot to invent action - actual plotlines - that would convey these trite messages and make them fresh. It's like a clinic in what Henry James said not to do when he advised authors to show, not tell. The finale goes even farther, with Clark realizing that he shouldn't have let go of the past after all, because although his strength comes from Krypton, his heroic traits come from the Kent family farm. Only this message isn't dramatized -- nothing happens that would make the viewer realize it as lived truth -- instead it is rammed down our throats in the form of...words. We don't need characters saying things like,""A hero can only be as strong as his enemies, so that's why I, Lex Luthor, am here."" That is supposed to be the job of commentators and critics, who unearth such insights from a good story. But these modern protagonists insist on bloviating about their own significance. The rest of the story is either really bad science fiction or really generic soap opera, and the performances are the same. Some talented actors are dragged down by the lines they must speak. The splendid Erica Durance is turned into a sappy one-dimensional poster girl for faithfulness and fairy tale marriage; the mischievous Alison Mack barely rises above her Spielberg-like bedtime story scene; and it's hard to tell if Tom Welling can act, but he comes off as irretrievably stiff and not too bright, and doesn't look facially anything like any Superman we've ever seen in comics. If you like watching people make speeches about the deep meaning of life instead of embodying it, you'll love Smallville Season 10.

It seemed to struggle the most in the middle seasons, but the later seasons picked things back up again.  The final season for Smallville is still one of the better ones. The things that made Smallville great are still present: Lois and clark's fantastic chemistry, fun cameos from DC characters, good overarching storylines, and use of the Superman mythology. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to shake off the problems that have often been an issue in Smallville.  Some soap opera-esque drama, poor cgi, and anticlimactic conclusions to story arcs.  Season 10's best moments are when it begins moving Clark closer to becoming Superman. Seeing him wearing the glasses doing the dorky Clark Kent routine is just great. Lois and Clark's growing relationship is so much fun to watch.  (I think Erica Durance is my favorite actress who has portrayed Lois.). There are some really great episodes in this season, with a few ones that are homages to other movies ( including the hangover, the matrix, and thunderdome). Obviously the main draw of any show's final season is to see how it ends. The finale here is a microcosm of the entire series, it's a mix of great and dissapointing moments.  The resolving of the season-long story is quick and completely underwhelming.  (what about all that talk where this would be Clark's greatest challenge?) You will see him in the suit, but it's a quick look so don't expect much there. The best parts of the finale are its scenes between Clark an Lois, and Clark with his family. The return of Lex Luther brings the series full circle and will be a cool moment for fans. The 7 years later final scene also pays some nice homages to the Superman films.  It may not have been a completely satisfying finale, but it hits a lot of things that will make fans happy.  It's not the greatest show made, but it's the show we love despite its flaws.

After creators Al Gough and Miles Millar left, they couldn't keep up the full greatest that the show originally had, but did 2 pretty good seasons (8-9). Season 10  had significantly shown poor quality for episode ideas and keeping up with the series. In my opinion the writers didn't know how to end the series, so they came up with a lot of random episodes and then gave us a pretty crumby series finale. I would say about 10 episodes are actually good though, but the series  finale was not one of them. The first hour of the finale was a little boring dragging on about  Lois and clarks vows as they recite them In there mind and so on. During the finale there was a giant planet or sun coming to earth, but during the last hour it stayed a float in the air over Smallville until the very end when a little dot ( Clark as superman catches it). I thought that the producers where very cheap in showing Clark in the superman suit and most of the time either showed a very very small superman or just a close up of clarks face with the sky in the back ground. I don't understand why they couldn't create some great moments fully showimg him in the suit when in the past they always showed great superhero special effects. I was really excited after the season 9 finale that in season 10 he was going to be superman but it did not happen. Smallville is still one of the greatest shows of all time, even though season 10 was a let down.",3,Smallville seaon 10,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,1541,"['Smallville', 'season', '1-7', '5', 'stars', '8-9', '4', 'stars', 'season', '10', ""'ll"", 'give', '3', 'stars', '2', 'creators', 'Al', 'Gough', 'Miles', 'Millar', 'left', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'full', 'greatest', 'show', 'originally', 'had', 'did', '2', 'pretty', 'good', 'seasons', '8-9', 'Season', '10', 'had', 'significantly', 'shown', 'poor', 'quality', 'episode', 'ideas', 'keeping', 'up', 'series', 'opinion', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'end', 'series', 'came', 'up', 'lot', 'random', 'episodes', 'then', 'gave', 'pretty', 'crumby', 'series', 'finale', 'would', 'say', '10', 'episodes', 'are', 'actually', 'good', 'series', 'finale', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'first', 'hour', 'finale', 'was', 'little', 'boring', 'dragging', 'Lois', 'clarks', 'vows', 'recite', 'mind', 'so', 'finale', 'was', 'giant', 'planet', 'sun', 'coming', 'earth', 'last', 'hour', 'stayed', 'float', 'air', 'Smallville', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'little', 'dot', 'Clark', 'superman', 'catches', 'thought', 'producers', 'where', 'very', 'cheap', 'showing', 'Clark', 'superman', 'suit', 'most', 'time', 'showed', 'very', 'very', 'small', 'superman', 'just', 'close', 'clarks', 'face', 'sky', 'back', 'ground', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'create', 'great', 'moments', 'fully', 'showimg', 'suit', 'when', 'past', 'always', 'showed', 'great', 'superhero', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'season', '9', 'finale', 'season', '10', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'superman', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'Smallville', 'still', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', 'time', 'even', 'season', '10', 'was', 'let', 'down']",Smallville: The Final Season

A few stand-out episodes pepper the season early on and Erica Durance's Lois Lane charms us through and through.  However, fans who loyally waited for Clark to get the suit and finally fly under the colors of his heroic destiny will be sorely disappointed.  The obvious ""blue-screen"" effects and the fact that Clark was in costume for what was probably less than 8 minutes at the end of the final episode suggest that the creators of the series begrudgingly gave fans what they were clamoring for -- and only at the last moment.  Other plot and character inconsistencies abound.

1351970,AP3B615GM191G,B003L77GG0,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[9, 17]","As in seasons eight and nine of ""Smallville"", this tenth season will appeal to fans of the ""comic action-adventure"" variety.  Those looking for solid writing, richly developed characters, and legitimate, non-predictable ""wow"" moments have likely trickled off after seasons 5-6.  I have been with the series for the long haul and, while thoroughly enjoying the first 5 seasons, liking 6-7, and despising 8-9, I cannot give the final season good reviews based on nostalgia perpetuated by the show's ending.There are a few basic plotlines that run throughout this final season, all of which fall flat in one way or another:-The U.S. government's reaction to superheroes: an almost blatant rip-off of many themes from ""The Dark Knight"".-The Clark/Lois relationship: Should work, but (as writers) you can't have Lois be EASILY the most annoying character on the show for six seasons and then expect us to put all that aside and love her in the seventh.-Clark Kent coming to terms with the hero he is destined to become: Pretty much every decision/conclusion Clark comes to this season in terms of embracing his destiny is watered-down due to botched attempts in previous seasons.  Because the show was on a year-to-year basis for so long, the frequent stops-and-starts in Clark's transition to Superman rendered that penultimate transition without much drama.Really, there are only three things that I enjoyed about this season (aka the reason I can give it 2 stars instead of just 1):-The ""Earth 2"" plot arc, which allowed us to see some characters that hadn't been around for awhile.  The alter-universe characters kind of muddy things up in the end, but it is nice to see them as ""themselves"" once again.-The episode ""Homecoming"", where the Smallville writers give a not-so-subtle nod of acceptance to fans like me who became disenchanted after the season five episode ""Reckoning"" and the slow bleed that followed.-The ""Finale"" episode, where us long-surviving fans finally get the payoff that we've all been waiting for.Thus, it basically comes down to this: If you loved ""Smallville"" in the early goings and feel it has declined since ""Reckoning"", this season won't change that opinion whatsoever.  However, if you still got enjoyment out of the later seasons, you'll probably like this one too.",2,A Mediocre End To A Conflicted Show,1305331200,"05 14, 2011",2011,2295,"['seasons', 'eight', 'nine', 'Smallville', 'tenth', 'season', 'will', 'appeal', 'fans', 'comic', 'action-adventure', 'variety', 'looking', 'solid', 'writing', 'richly', 'developed', 'characters', 'legitimate', 'non-predictable', 'wow', 'moments', 'have', 'likely', 'trickled', 'off', 'seasons', '5-6', 'have', 'been', 'series', 'long', 'haul', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'first', '5', 'seasons', 'liking', '6-7', 'despising', '8-9', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'final', 'season', 'good', 'reviews', 'based', 'nostalgia', 'perpetuated', 'show', 'are', 'few', 'basic', 'plotlines', 'run', 'final', 'season', 'fall', 'flat', 'one', 'way', '-The', 'U.S.', 'government', 'reaction', 'superheroes', 'almost', 'blatant', 'rip-off', 'many', 'themes', 'Dark', 'Knight', '.-The', 'Clark/Lois', 'relationship', 'Should', 'work', 'writers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Lois', 'be', 'EASILY', 'most', 'annoying', 'character', 'show', 'six', 'seasons', 'then', 'expect', 'put', 'aside', 'love', 'seventh.-Clark', 'Kent', 'coming', 'terms', 'hero', 'destined', 'become', 'Pretty', 'much', 'decision/conclusion', 'Clark', 'season', 'terms', 'embracing', 'destiny', 'watered-down', 'due', 'botched', 'attempts', 'previous', 'seasons', 'show', 'was', 'year-to-year', 'basis', 'so', 'long', 'frequent', 'stops-and-starts', 'Clark', 'transition', 'Superman', 'rendered', 'penultimate', 'transition', 'much', 'drama.Really', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'things', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'reason', 'can', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'instead', 'just', '1', '-The', 'Earth', '2', 'plot', 'arc', 'allowed', 'see', 'characters', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'around', 'awhile', 'alter-universe', 'characters', 'kind', 'muddy', 'things', 'up', 'end', 'nice', 'see', 'once', 'again.-The', 'episode', 'Homecoming', 'where', 'Smallville', 'writers', 'give', 'not-so-subtle', 'nod', 'acceptance', 'fans', 'who', 'became', 'disenchanted', 'season', 'five', 'episode', 'Reckoning', 'slow', 'bleed', 'followed.-The', 'Finale', 'episode', 'where', 'long-surviving', 'fans', 'finally', 'get', 'payoff', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'for.Thus', 'basically', 'down', 'loved', 'Smallville', 'early', 'goings', 'feel', 'declined', 'Reckoning', 'season', 'wo', ""n't"", 'change', 'opinion', 'whatsoever', 'However', 'still', 'got', 'enjoyment', 'later', 'seasons', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'one', 'too']",Smallville: The Final Season
