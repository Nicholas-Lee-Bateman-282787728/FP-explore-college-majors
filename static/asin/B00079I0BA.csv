878992,A3G2MJPURQSCBD,B00079I0BA,Big Miles Davis Fan,"[0, 0]",Here is a concert performed by the Funky Meters at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in the year 2000. The music performed here is not rhythm and blues. This is funk music of the 1960s and '70s and it reminds me of James Brown and his band of the era. It is good funk. This is Sunday at the park.The picture quality of the DVD is very good but it was released in the 4:3 aspect ratio for small and mid size TVs (tube TV) although it up-converts well for display on HDTV. On my audio system the two channel option provides better over all sound than the 5.1 option- (this my differ on other audio systems).,4,"Funk Music All The Way, And Good",1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,614,"['Here', 'concert', 'performed', 'Funky', 'Meters', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Jazz', 'Heritage', 'Festival', 'year', '2000', 'music', 'performed', 'here', 'not', 'rhythm', 'blues', 'funk', 'music', '1960s', ""'70s"", 'James', 'Brown', 'band', 'era', 'good', 'funk', 'Sunday', 'park.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'released', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'small', 'mid', 'size', 'TVs', 'tube', 'TV', 'up-converts', 'well', 'display', 'HDTV', 'audio', 'system', 'two', 'channel', 'option', 'better', 'sound', '5.1', 'option-', 'differ', 'other', 'audio', 'systems']",N/A

I've been to the New Orleans Jazz Fest, and I've seen these guys perform live. They are ""awesome"". This was a picture perfect day in New Orleans to film this concert dvd, its sunny, the crowd is large (around 125,000 probably), and the band is fantastic.If you like New Orleans Funk, buy this you'll love it. If you don't think you'll like it, buy it anyway, because after you watch it, you'll love it, (that is if you're a music lover at all). Thanks, and may God Bless!!!",5,"Pure New Orleans Funk ""Live from the New Orleans Jazz Festival"" DVD",1234137600,"02 9, 2009",2009,564,"['Great', 'concert', 'DVD', 'agree', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'gave', 'helpful', 'vote', ""'ve"", 'been', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Jazz', 'Fest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'guys', 'perform', 'live', 'are', 'awesome', 'was', 'picture', 'perfect', 'day', 'New', 'Orleans', 'film', 'concert', 'dvd', 'sunny', 'crowd', 'large', '125,000', 'probably', 'band', 'fantastic.If', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Funk', 'buy', ""'ll"", 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'like', 'buy', 'anyway', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'love', ""'re"", 'music', 'lover', 'Thanks', 'may', 'God', 'Bless']",N/A

If you've never had the pleasure of seeing these American Masters practicing their own form of voodoo, purchase a copy of this disc. These guys wrote the book on funk and nobody, but nobody can do it like these guys. This is like getting a chance to sit in Picasso's living room and watching him paint. You will enjoy this infectious groove and the amazing musicianship and tight performances on this disc.",5,This Is As Funky As It Gets,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,442,"['guys', 'are', 'as', 'funky', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'American', 'Masters', 'practicing', 'own', 'form', 'voodoo', 'purchase', 'copy', 'disc', 'guys', 'wrote', 'book', 'funk', 'nobody', 'nobody', 'can', 'do', 'guys', 'getting', 'chance', 'sit', 'Picasso', 'living', 'room', 'watching', 'paint', 'will', 'enjoy', 'infectious', 'groove', 'amazing', 'musicianship', 'tight', 'performances', 'disc']",N/A
