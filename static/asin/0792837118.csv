The DVD transfer does full justice to the film's visual qualities with an excellent picture quality.But given that 3/4 of the movie consists of Rodgers and Hart's wonderful score, it's a pity that MGA/UA has over-processed the sound on the DVD. Apparently in an effort to reduce any hint of tape hiss, the soundtrack has gone through a noise reduction process that removes the  high frequencies and results in a deadened, distorted sound compared to the earlier VHS and laserdisc releases. Hart's great rhyming couplets just don't sound the same!If you have the excellent laserdisc edition of Hallelujah I'm A Bum, you can skip the DVD release.

I just can't say to a friend that they have to see this great film I watched.

I'm an easy mark for that sort of story line especially with such an ending.I agree that it is Jolson's greatest performance....very likeable and underplayed. If you haven't seen it, watch it.

137936,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0792837118,C. O. DeRiemer,"[20, 22]","Richard Rogers and Lorenz Hart had just scored a critical and popular success with 1932's Love Me Tonight. They used their new leverage with their next film, Hallelujah I'm A Bum, to push further their idea of rhyming dialogue and more integrated songs. The movie starred Al Jolson and was a poignant tale of a happy-go-lucky bum who falls for a woman he rescues from a lake who has amnesia, only to lose her to a good friend of his who had been her lover. Despite the film's many charms, it was just too unusual and probably too bittersweet. It didn't do well at the box office. As a result, Rodgers and Hart were consigned to the fate of all the other Broadway songwriters who had come to Hollywood when the Depression cut the legs off much of the Broadway theater; they were given piecemeal assignments with the songs altered, cut, changed or dropped at the whim of the producers. Within a year and a half the pair had fled Hollywood, returned to Broadway and created a stunning series of hit musicals until the partnership finally came apart in 1943.Bumper (Al Jolson) is a cheerful, resourceful bum, the leader of the Central Park lay-abouts. He has his standards, too. His friends call him the Mayor of Central Park, and among those friends is Mayor Hastings, the real mayor of New York City. Hastings keeps a mistress, June Marsden (Madge Evans), whom through a mistaken series of events he believes is being unfaithful. She tries to explain, he says he no longer wants to see her, and so she wanders to Central Park, jumps off the bridge into the lake and is rescued by Bumper. She has amnesia. Bumper falls for her, and falls hard. He even gets a job at a bank so he can take care of her. But Hastings realizes how much he loves June and how wrong he was about her. Bumper finds out the girl he calls Angel is really June Marsden, and honorably he brings her back together with Hastings. June recovers her memory, but now she sees Bumper only as this funny, harmless bum. The last we see of Bumper he has given up his coat and tie and returned to Central Park. He's leaning back on a bench and staring at the sky. Some how, we know, his innate cheerfulness and sense of what's right will pull him through.Probably a third of the movie is made up of lengthy set pieces involving stretches of rhymed dialogue half sung, half spoken. Rodgers and Hart wrote several songs, but they are so much a part of the characters and the plot that only two can stand alone. One, You Are Too Beautiful, became a hit. The other, I've Got To Get Back to New York, became a standard among supper club saloon singers like Bobby Short.Al Jolson does a first-rate job as Bumper. He had such an outsized personality that you can see how he could easily dominate a theater. In movies, you can also see how he could just be too much. Here, he's playing a nice guy, a little shy at times but basically a confident, fair-minded man with a sense of what's right. Jolson isn't exactly subdued, but you wind up liking his character. He's the point of the movie, and he makes the movie work. Frank Morgan does a fine job as the mayor, tired of his duties, a charming man, not realizing he loves June until it's almost too late. Madge Evans doesn't have a lot to work with, but she looks great and works well with both Jolson and Morgan. One of the standouts in the cast is Harry Langdon as Egghead, who picks up trash in the park. He's an innocent Red, a naive socialist, a friend of Bumper's most of the time. Langdon was one of the great silent comics of the Twenties until success went to his head. By the time the talkies came in Langdon was doing bit parts. Nothing came of his prominent role in Hallelujah, but you can see why he was big in his prime. He has a child-like face and a confused expression, he's a little helpless, he stumbles about some, and he is a master of small bits of business. Also on hand is Chester Conklin, once one of the Keystone Kops and a great silent movie clown, as a driver of a horse-drawn park carriage who has as forbidding a wife as you can imagine.The movie is dated but is still great fun. If you're interested in the development of Hollywood musicals, or Rogers and Hart, or Al Jolson, or just movies that tried being unconventional, you might enjoy watching and owning this one. The DVD presentation is very good considering the age of the film. There are no extras.We'll let Bumper have the last words:Rockefeller's busy giving dough away;Chevrolet is busy making cars;Hobo, you keep busy when they throw awaySlightly used cigars.Hobo, you've no time to shirk.You're busy keeping far away from work.The weather's getting fine.The coffee tastes like wine.You happy hobo, sing,""Hallelujah, I'm a bum again!""Why work away for wealthWhen you can

Jolson's charisma would carry the film, but even without its star, there are some pretty good songs from Rogers and Hart, despite this not being one of their well-known musicals. The story is a little far-fetched, with the majority of the hobos who inhabit Central Park seeming to do so by choice, and living the life of Riley whilst doing so. Jolson's character Bumper even has a valet! But this is a piece of whimsy so it is not fair to criticise it for being whimsical. Jolson is at the height of his powers, being the star of hit after hit on Broadway and in the Cinema.There are some amusing supporting performances, notably from later Wizard Of Oz Frank Morgan as the Mayor, and silent star Harry Langdon nearly stealing the show as Egghead, an intellectual, left wing tramp, who has some pretty progressive dialogue for 1933.

137939,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,0792837118,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","There are basically two types of musical: the ""show"" or ""classic"" musical, in which a loose plot provides an excuse for musical numbers, and the ""integrated"" musical, in which the plot and musical numbers support each other.  The show musical was standard well into the twentieth century; even so, the shift toward the integrated musical began fairly early in the century, and surprisingly it was Hollywood that led the way.  Among the landmarks in this change was the 1933 HALLELUJAH I'M A BUM, which featured music by Rogers & Hart and which starred the most famous singer of the era, Al Jolson.The story is classic Great Depression nonsense.  While the rich, famous, and powerful struggle with penthouse difficulties, the homeless are cheerful folk who bounce from meal to meal in happy fashion.  The result is a fantasy world in which a Central Park tramp (Jolson) and the Mayor of New York (Frank Morgan) can be friends and social equals.  When a misunderstanding occurs between the mayor and his girl (Madge Evans), the high society girl decides to throw herself off a bridge--and is rescued by the tramp.  The girl looses her memory in the fall, the tramp doesn't know who she is, and the frantic mayor doesn't know where she is.  Needless to say, much romantic and comic confusion ensues.Seen today, there is something intrinsically distasteful in the ""happy hobo"" construct, which has it that all these homeless folk are just as merry as you and I and don't actually want or need a roof over their heads.  But what makes HALLELUJAH I'M A BUM famous isn't the story line or even the performances: it's the way the movie handles the transition between script and song.  Instead of simply having the actors burst into song, the way is smoothed by a dialogue-like but distinctly musical patter.  It was a novel approach, and it would point the way to everything from THE WIZARD OF OZ to GIGI.  The script by S.N. Behrman is clever and witty, and director Louis Milestone is extremely innovative in his staging.  Yes, HALLELUJAH I'M A BUM was and is an extremely, extremely influential film.  On the other hand, it's not a greatly watchable one.The big problem is Al Jolson (1886-1950), who was easily the single most famous singer of his day.  Trouble was, Jolson was never able to find a way to translate himself to film: he instead plays exactly as if he is on the Broadway stage and has to reach the very last row of balcony seats.  The result is uncomfortably stagy, with lots of eye rolling and you-may-applaud-now moments.  It is incredibly tiresome.  The other performances are alternately tiresome (Harold Langdon) and merely acceptable (Morgan, Evans), the music isn't all that memorable, and in spite of the clever script and Milestone's speed-slick direction the whole thing feels stale.  To add insult to injury, the DVD picture and sound quality isn't all that great.  So, unless you're a hardcore fan who has to trace the roots of the American musical, you might want to give HALLELUJAH I'M A BUM a miss.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,Landmark Musical Shows It's Age,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,3043,"['are', 'basically', 'two', 'types', 'musical', 'show', 'classic', 'musical', 'loose', 'plot', 'excuse', 'musical', 'numbers', 'integrated', 'musical', 'plot', 'musical', 'numbers', 'support', 'other', 'show', 'musical', 'was', 'standard', 'well', 'twentieth', 'century', 'even', 'so', 'shift', 'integrated', 'musical', 'began', 'fairly', 'early', 'century', 'surprisingly', 'was', 'Hollywood', 'led', 'way', 'landmarks', 'change', 'was', '1933', 'HALLELUJAH', ""'M"", 'BUM', 'featured', 'music', 'Rogers', 'Hart', 'starred', 'most', 'famous', 'singer', 'era', 'Al', 'Jolson.The', 'story', 'classic', 'Great', 'Depression', 'nonsense', 'rich', 'famous', 'powerful', 'struggle', 'penthouse', 'difficulties', 'homeless', 'are', 'cheerful', 'folk', 'who', 'bounce', 'meal', 'meal', 'happy', 'fashion', 'result', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Central', 'Park', 'tramp', 'Jolson', 'Mayor', 'New', 'York', 'Frank', 'Morgan', 'can', 'be', 'friends', 'social', 'equals', 'When', 'misunderstanding', 'mayor', 'girl', 'Madge', 'Evans', 'high', 'society', 'girl', 'throw', 'off', 'bridge', 'rescued', 'tramp', 'girl', 'memory', 'fall', 'tramp', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'frantic', 'mayor', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'Needless', 'say', 'much', 'romantic', 'comic', 'confusion', 'ensues.Seen', 'today', 'something', 'intrinsically', 'distasteful', 'happy', 'hobo', 'construct', 'homeless', 'folk', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'merry', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'want', 'need', 'roof', 'heads', 'what', 'HALLELUJAH', ""'M"", 'BUM', 'famous', ""n't"", 'story', 'line', 'even', 'performances', 'way', 'movie', 'transition', 'script', 'song', 'Instead', 'simply', 'having', 'actors', 'burst', 'song', 'way', 'smoothed', 'dialogue-like', 'distinctly', 'musical', 'patter', 'was', 'novel', 'approach', 'would', 'point', 'way', 'everything', 'THE', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'GIGI', 'script', 'S.N', 'Behrman', 'clever', 'witty', 'director', 'Louis', 'Milestone', 'extremely', 'innovative', 'staging', 'Yes', 'HALLELUJAH', ""'M"", 'BUM', 'was', 'extremely', 'extremely', 'influential', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'greatly', 'watchable', 'one.The', 'big', 'problem', 'Al', 'Jolson', '1886-1950', 'who', 'was', 'easily', 'single', 'most', 'famous', 'singer', 'day', 'Trouble', 'was', 'Jolson', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'find', 'way', 'translate', 'film', 'instead', 'exactly', 'Broadway', 'stage', 'reach', 'very', 'last', 'row', 'balcony', 'seats', 'result', 'uncomfortably', 'stagy', 'lots', 'eye', 'rolling', 'you-may-applaud-now', 'moments', 'incredibly', 'tiresome', 'other', 'performances', 'are', 'alternately', 'tiresome', 'Harold', 'Langdon', 'merely', 'acceptable', 'Morgan', 'Evans', 'music', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'spite', 'clever', 'script', 'Milestone', 'speed-slick', 'direction', 'whole', 'thing', 'feels', 'stale', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'DVD', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', ""n't"", 'great', 'So', ""'re"", 'hardcore', 'fan', 'who', 'trace', 'roots', 'American', 'musical', 'might', 'want', 'give', 'HALLELUJAH', ""'M"", 'BUM', 'miss.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",N/A

Al Jolson sings numerous songs marvelously throughout the entire picture; and the plot moves along at a fine pace. The action and musical numbers held my attention. Some people may call this film an oddity but it's really a much better film than that. They released it on DVD when other great films still remain only on VHS; and that's proof enough for me that this is one film you definitely want to watch.The action begins in Florida where the Mayor of New York John Hastings (Frank Morgan) is vacationing--at the same time that his homeless buddy Bumper (Al Jolson) is there with his sidekick Acorn (Edgar Connor). We see how they are friends and how both Mayor Hastings and Bumper passionately believe in their own lifestyles: Bumper wants nothing more than to be free--of money, that is; and he lives off the land in Central Park with pride (and a little financial help from none other than Mayor Hastings). Mayor John Hastings seems to be the ultimate capitalist ham who is remarkably wealthy as he poses for press ""photo ops"" even on vacation with a goose that he shot while hunting.Soon, however, they all return to New York--the mayor by train, Bumper and Acorn by hitchhiking. Back in New York, Mayor Hastings has a huge misunderstanding with his lover June Marcher (Madge Evans); and the couple split up. June can't recover from the pain. When June tries to kill herself by jumping into the water in Central Park, Bumper just happens to notice and he saves her life. June lives; but she can't remember anything about her life. When she quickly falls for Bumper, he gets a job through the Mayor and pays for her to be able to rent a small room.Of course, all throughout the movie there are great musical numbers; and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart have a great cameo in the film as photographers when Mayor Hastings must lay a cornerstone for a new public school. Perhaps you can figure how the plot winds toward the ending of the picture; but I won't give away any spoilers here!The cinematography shows careful forethought in crowd scenes with all the homeless people in Central Park gathering around to celebrate the return of Bumper and Acorn to their ""neighborhood"" after their Florida vacation; and the choreography works wonders in the musical numbers that showcase Jolson and his sidekick Acorn (Edgar Connor) with the park people following them as together they all march and sing their way through the park.The DVD comes with few extras: you get the theatrical trailer and optional subtitles in French and Spanish. However, the movie is so enjoyable that I will overlook this.I highly recommend Hallelujah I'm A Bum for Al Jolson fans and fans of early Hollywood musicals. The razor thin plot just barely works; but the real reason you watch this movie is for the song and dance numbers. In addition, people who like silent films will delight to see Harry Langdon as Egghead the Communist litter man; and Frank Morgan gives a great performance as Mayor John Hastings.Enjoy!",5,fine Jolson vehicle,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,3115,"['Hallelujah', ""'m"", 'Bum', 'let', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'really', 'flex', 'muscle', 'one', 'earliest', 'musicals', 'talkies', 'were', 'invented', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'numerous', 'songs', 'marvelously', 'entire', 'picture', 'plot', 'along', 'fine', 'pace', 'action', 'musical', 'numbers', 'held', 'attention', 'people', 'may', 'call', 'film', 'oddity', 'really', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'released', 'DVD', 'when', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'still', 'remain', 'only', 'VHS', 'proof', 'enough', 'one', 'film', 'definitely', 'want', 'watch.The', 'action', 'Florida', 'where', 'Mayor', 'New', 'York', 'John', 'Hastings', 'Frank', 'Morgan', 'vacationing', 'same', 'time', 'homeless', 'buddy', 'Bumper', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'sidekick', 'Acorn', 'Edgar', 'Connor', 'see', 'how', 'are', 'friends', 'how', 'Mayor', 'Hastings', 'Bumper', 'passionately', 'believe', 'own', 'lifestyles', 'Bumper', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'free', 'money', 'land', 'Central', 'Park', 'pride', 'little', 'financial', 'help', 'none', 'other', 'Mayor', 'Hastings', 'Mayor', 'John', 'Hastings', 'be', 'ultimate', 'capitalist', 'ham', 'who', 'remarkably', 'wealthy', 'press', 'photo', 'ops', 'even', 'vacation', 'goose', 'shot', 'hunting.Soon', 'however', 'return', 'New', 'York', 'mayor', 'train', 'Bumper', 'Acorn', 'hitchhiking', 'Back', 'New', 'York', 'Mayor', 'Hastings', 'huge', 'misunderstanding', 'lover', 'June', 'Marcher', 'Madge', 'Evans', 'couple', 'split', 'up', 'June', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recover', 'pain', 'When', 'June', 'kill', 'jumping', 'water', 'Central', 'Park', 'Bumper', 'just', 'notice', 'life', 'June', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'life', 'When', 'quickly', 'Bumper', 'job', 'Mayor', 'pays', 'be', 'able', 'rent', 'small', 'room.Of', 'course', 'movie', 'are', 'great', 'musical', 'numbers', 'Richard', 'Rodgers', 'Lorenz', 'Hart', 'have', 'great', 'cameo', 'film', 'photographers', 'when', 'Mayor', 'Hastings', 'must', 'lay', 'cornerstone', 'new', 'public', 'school', 'Perhaps', 'can', 'figure', 'how', 'plot', 'ending', 'picture', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'spoilers', 'here', 'cinematography', 'careful', 'forethought', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'homeless', 'people', 'Central', 'Park', 'gathering', 'around', 'celebrate', 'return', 'Bumper', 'Acorn', 'neighborhood', 'Florida', 'vacation', 'choreography', 'wonders', 'musical', 'numbers', 'showcase', 'Jolson', 'sidekick', 'Acorn', 'Edgar', 'Connor', 'park', 'people', 'following', 'together', 'march', 'sing', 'way', 'park.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'get', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'optional', 'subtitles', 'French', 'Spanish', 'However', 'movie', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'will', 'overlook', 'this.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Hallelujah', ""'m"", 'Bum', 'Al', 'Jolson', 'fans', 'fans', 'early', 'Hollywood', 'musicals', 'razor', 'thin', 'plot', 'just', 'barely', 'real', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'song', 'dance', 'numbers', 'addition', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'silent', 'films', 'will', 'delight', 'see', 'Harry', 'Langdon', 'Egghead', 'Communist', 'litter', 'man', 'Frank', 'Morgan', 'great', 'performance', 'Mayor', 'John', 'Hastings.Enjoy']",N/A

137943,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,0792837118,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","Hallelujah,I'm a Bum was released in Feb/33 right in the darkest and bleakest days of the depression.Hollywood was trying everything it could to help brighten and entertain the weary populace out there that could afford to come to the movie theatres.Alot of the film is done in musical rhyme and there are not only plenty of references to the current state of economical affairs(the whole premise of tramps in Central Park was its biggest point of sale!)but to alternative paths that might prove to be better:specifically,the socialistic philosophy being spewed out by the intelligentsia of the day(Russia was proudly showcasing its Marxist-Leninist way of doing things in those days).Starring in this,now,curious melange,was Al Jolson as Bumper,the ersatz mayor of Central Park,the ""real"" mayor of NYC Frank Morgan,Madge Evans as the mayors girlfriend June,Edgar Connor as Acorn,Jolie's sidekick,Harry Langdon as Egghead,Chester Conklin as Sunday,his wife Ma played by Louise Carver(the face that could launch a thousand ships,and sink 'em just as fast!),and many others.The story has two plots going simultaneously.First off is Jolson's part as the unofficial mayor of Central Park.He is,to use the vernacular of the times,a bum,and along with all his other Central Park ""citizens"",proud of it.When Jolie isn't singing sweet of his idyllic life,he is greeting the mayor in front of his apartment building everyday to open his car door for him.It seems he saved the mayors life a while back and the mayor has been forever grateful.The second plot is with the mayor,who has an on and off again relationship going with pretty Madge Evans.He caught her with another man but forgave her and took her back.When he gives her a substantial amount of money and she loses the purse it was in,he assumes she has again been seeing someone else.They part.Despondent she tries to commit suicide by drowning herself in the park, but Jolie is there to save her.When she comes to she has lost her memory.Jolie falls in love and actually gets a job,courtesy of the mayor,in order to put a roof over their heads.Meanwhile the mayor has searched high and low and cannot find his sweetheart.He grows increasingly anxious and turns to drinking to try and forget about her.One evening Conklin(a park carriage driver)drops by Jolies apartment with the mayor in his carriage,drunk.Jolie accompanies the mayor home and it is there the mayor pours out his feelings to Jolie,who in turn finally sees who it is the mayor is so hurt over.Jolie,of course,does the right thing and takes the mayor over to his place and the two have a tearful reunion,with Evans instantly regaining her memory on seeing him again.Jolie returns to the park and his idyllic life.The film has its stops and starts throughout.Sometimes the musical numbers compliment the action,other times they can hinder the plot development by slowing things down unnecessarily.This was the first full fledged effort to do much of a film in rhythmic musical numbers and complimentary dialogue.It had been done before but only in little bits.All through it shines Jolson's singing abilities,not to mention his acting ones too.Langdons performance is remarkable considering the vituperative remarks leveled at him after his 20s downfall.It shows he still had alot to offer,in the proper roles,and probably one reason Stan Laurel still considered him good enough to use as a consultant from time to time.The opening credits has this as a Joseph Schenck presents film.We all recall Schenck and his selling out of Keatons contract to MGM,which pretty much put his career on a slow boat to China.Watch for Harold Goodwin,Keaton's friend and co star in many of his pre MGM and MGM films and beyond,as Madge's boyfriend the mayor originally discovered her with.The music was composed and written by the legendary duo of Rodgers and Hart.It is an uneven but pretty good score.Jolie gets his best out of it with his number to his Central Park friends in ""Why do you need Money?""(the Jolie of old suddenly bursts forth with strong emotion)and later singing to Madge with ""You are too beautiful"".Watch for Frank Morgan espousing""There's no place like home"",ala Judy Garland about 5-6 years later in the Wizard of Oz.Remember that Frank was the Wizard of Oz!Lastly,when you think about it,there are few of these stars with the major exceptions of Morgan and Evans,that weren't considered ""past it"",at this time.Technically speaking the film is in its full frame a/r and is a pretty good print.However it does need a good remastering and cleaning up in picture and sound.The only extra is the films trailer.All in all an early 30s curiosity right out of the dark depression.The musical numbers and patter are done rhythmically and can be good or less,depending on the number.Frank Morgan is always a treat to watch and Jolie does a great job in the starring role.He is ably supported and folks still find that Landon's performance was excellently done,not the washed up has been he was touted to have been at that point.It's not an OSCAR calibre film by any measure,but just a nice piece of escapism for the 30s audiences who needed it so badly.3-3 1/2 stars.",3,From the heart of the depression comes...,1355270400,"12 12,

137944,A36N4G46V0VD65,0792837118,"Robert M. Fells ""Mr. Arliss's Official Biogra...","[26, 28]","This film is from a wonderful but short-lived era in Hollywood during 1932-33 when the studios encouraged experimentation with the musical genre.  The first musical films of the early talkie era, circa 1928-31, tended to be stage-bound, static and boring. For a time, theaters even advertised that certain films having musical-sounding titles were in fact not musicals because people were avoiding them!In 1932, director Rouben Mamoulian at Paramount made LOVE ME TONIGHT - and why hasn't THAT film ever come out on video? - and Lewis Milestone at United Artists made BUM.  Ironically, both films had scores written by Rogers and Hart. Filming of the Mamoulian project, starring Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald, seems to have gone smoothly enough.  But BUM seemed to be a jinxed film from the start.  Roland Young originally played the mayor but became sick or otherwise unavailable so his many scenes had to be refilmed with Frank Morgan in the role.Evidently, BUM was completed in 1932, but preview audience reactions were so bad, major refilming was needed.  It sounds like a nightmare.  When the second version was finally released in 1933, it was a commercial failure and UA and Al Jolson agreed to drop plans for two more films.None of these problems are apparent watching the film today.  The film is fresh and inventive and for once Jolson has plenty of elbow room to sing his heart out.  Even his acting, a weak point in all Jolson films, is quite good here.  Jolson complained that Milestone made him repeat scenes endlessly but the director seems to have been getting the self-consciousness out of Jolson's acting style.  It worked! BUM is the only film Jolson made where he does not appear in blackface, making it the only &quot;politically correct&quot; film of his career and the only one shown these days in public places (I notice that BUM is also the only Jolson film on dvd so far).That said, this film is probably not for all tastes.  As much as I admire this film, I don't understand why they couldn't have picked a better plot.  Americans were too alarmed by the Depression in 1933 to find much amusement in a fanciful tale of life as a bum in NYC's Central Park.  Despite its excellence, no wonder it flopped.Highly recommended for anybody who wants to see how inventive filmmaking can be.

137945,A387BD735MI50R,0792837118,R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","(This is a review of the VHS version.)This movie is a real find. It's done in an unusual light opera format and features a lot of rhyming sing-song that almost anticipates some of the more clever rhyming action of modern rap artists.The movie was ahead of its time in another way too. It shows a nearly egalitarian interracial friendship - the friendship between two hobo characters played by Al Jolson and Edgar Connor. The relative lack of a racial divide between them carries over to the rest of the film. When the Mayor of New York, wonderfully acted by Frank Morgan, hands out a job in a bank to Jolson, who's briefly determined to reform out of his idle hobo ways - the Mayor at the same time hands out a job in the bank to Jolson's black compatriot.It's true the two are then shown working in different departments in the bank. Jolson has a white-collar job stamping forms, while his buddy is in the adjacent back room sorting sacks. Still, the degree of equality shown in this movie is remarkable for the period. I can't think of any comparable adult interracial friendship shown for several more decades - until possibly ""The Defiant Ones"" came along with Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier. And then, those two yoked men had a lot of baggage of racial discord they had to get rid of before they could become friends. In ""Hallelujah,"" white man and black man are shown being easy, natural friends from the beginning.Part of the reason for that might be the movie's willingness to entertain some of the Communist philosophy that was being bandied then as a solution to the poverty of that Depression era. While most of the hoboes shout him down, the marginally employed hobo played by the noted silent era comedian Harry Langdon recites a lot of Marxist doctrine about the necessity of unity among ""working"" men.The people involved in the making of this film comprise a ""Whos's Who"" of the Hollywood/Broadway scene of the 20's and 30's. There are the stars already named, led by Al Jolson. Then the script was done by S. N. Behrman, based on a work by Ben Hecht.  The famous duo of Rodgers and Hart wrote the score - and make a cameo appearance in the movie as press photographers. Watch for them!None of the music they came up with for this film is very memorable. After a while though, I found I actually didn't mind this lack of catchy tunes. It gave me a chance to appreciate the unusual timbre of Al Jolson's voice all the more. For once, his sheer talent wasn't swamped by the overriding liveliness of the likes of ""Swanee."" I realized how he could read the phone book and make it into resonating melody.Also, Jolson plays his character here with such unfailing good-nature and charismatic gusto - the film can't fail to give you a lift.

(1933) remains the one Al Jolson vehicle that stands the cinematic test of time - despite the fact it was a box-office failure when first released. Jolson never has been more ingratiating as he performs some wonderful Rodgers and Hart songs.
