Also, there are so many great episodes, and most of the kids favorites did not make it onto this dvd. And when watching the show in tv, they have a ""Badge Quest"" in between each episode, the dvd does not. We DVD the episodes, and actually prefer to watch those instead of the DVD.Chuggington is a great show though. It is very kid friendly and much easier to watch and understand than the Thomas the Train show. Chuggington teaches values and is really a great show. I enjoy watching it with my kids and would have loved the DVD to be longer and have some of the better episodes. Especially since it took such a long time to come out on DVD.",4,Great show!,1302393600,"04 10, 2011",2011,837,"['were', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'Chuggington', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'however', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'only', '6', 'episodes', 'episode', 'only', 'about', '15', 'minutes', 'long', 'shorter', 'most', 'kids', 'dvds', 'Also', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'episodes', 'most', 'kids', 'favorites', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'dvd', 'when', 'watching', 'show', 'tv', 'have', 'Badge', 'Quest', 'episode', 'dvd', 'not', 'DVD', 'episodes', 'actually', 'prefer', 'watch', 'instead', 'DVD.Chuggington', 'great', 'show', 'very', 'kid', 'friendly', 'much', 'easier', 'watch', 'understand', 'Thomas', 'Train', 'show', 'Chuggington', 'values', 'really', 'great', 'show', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'kids', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'DVD', 'be', 'longer', 'have', 'better', 'episodes', 'Especially', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'come', 'out', 'DVD']",Chuggington: Let's Ride The Rails

1394360,A1V7RL4ODXXWDM,B004BD74NS,"Jennifer Bogart ""@ Quiverfullfamily.com""","[35, 36]","Like many of my children's favorite DVDs,, our family first discovered Chuggington on Treehouse.  Even though it has clearly been created for the preschool crowd, even my seven-year-old really enjoys the antics of these cheerful, computer-animated trains.  Similar to a modern-day Thomas the Tank Engine, this up-to-date train series has a very neat, futuristic train station, curvy streamlined engines, and short episodes that you can use to piece out just a bit of Chuggington at a time, or the whole shebang.The first Chuggington collection to be released on DVD, Let's Ride the Rails includes six episodes:Braking BrewsterClunky WilsonCan't Catch KokoOld Puffer Pete's TourKoko On CallHodge and the MagnetEach episode is around ten-minutes in length, making for a total running time of 62 minutes.There are also some coloring pages and activity sheets included on the DVD in pdf form that you can print from your computer, and a fun memory card game that can be played on screen on your television with your remote control.The Chuggers learn to help each other, be polite, be considerate, apologize to each other, and many other character-skills vital to life.  This is great because unfortunately some children's programming does NOT encourage the development of positive character traits in children.  This is very naturally integrated into the storylines, and is never overly preachy.  My children often ask for Chuggington, it's a very fun series for them to watch and the positive models presented to them certainly add to its appeal to me as a parent.I have to warn you in advance, Chuggington has one of the most addictive theme songs I've ever heard.  If you aren't afraid of finding yourself dancing around the house singing it to yourself throughout the day (ahem), then go ahead and get a copy.",4,Watch Out for That Theme Song...,1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,1809,"['many', 'children', 'favorite', 'DVDs', 'family', 'first', 'discovered', 'Chuggington', 'Treehouse', 'Even', 'clearly', 'been', 'created', 'preschool', 'crowd', 'even', 'seven-year-old', 'really', 'antics', 'cheerful', 'computer-animated', 'trains', 'Similar', 'modern-day', 'Thomas', 'Tank', 'Engine', 'up-to-date', 'train', 'series', 'very', 'neat', 'futuristic', 'train', 'station', 'curvy', 'streamlined', 'engines', 'short', 'episodes', 'can', 'use', 'piece', 'out', 'just', 'bit', 'Chuggington', 'time', 'whole', 'shebang.The', 'first', 'Chuggington', 'collection', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Let', 'Ride', 'Rails', 'six', 'episodes', 'Braking', 'BrewsterClunky', 'WilsonCa', ""n't"", 'Catch', 'KokoOld', 'Puffer', 'Pete', 'TourKoko', 'CallHodge', 'MagnetEach', 'episode', 'ten-minutes', 'length', 'making', 'total', 'running', 'time', '62', 'minutes.There', 'are', 'also', 'coloring', 'pages', 'activity', 'sheets', 'included', 'DVD', 'pdf', 'form', 'can', 'print', 'computer', 'fun', 'memory', 'card', 'game', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'screen', 'television', 'remote', 'control.The', 'Chuggers', 'learn', 'help', 'other', 'be', 'polite', 'be', 'considerate', 'apologize', 'other', 'many', 'other', 'character-skills', 'vital', 'life', 'great', 'unfortunately', 'children', 'programming', 'NOT', 'encourage', 'development', 'positive', 'character', 'traits', 'children', 'very', 'naturally', 'integrated', 'storylines', 'never', 'overly', 'preachy', 'children', 'often', 'ask', 'Chuggington', 'very', 'fun', 'series', 'watch', 'positive', 'models', 'presented', 'certainly', 'appeal', 'parent.I', 'have', 'warn', 'advance', 'Chuggington', 'one', 'most', 'addictive', 'theme', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'finding', 'dancing', 'house', 'singing', 'day', 'ahem', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'get', 'copy']",Chuggington: Let's Ride The Rails
1394361,A26K25KKMYY9TG,B004BD74NS,Lindsey,"[4, 4]","This DVD was our first introduction to Chuggington, and we love it!  My daughter prefers it to Thomas the Train Engine and I have to say I do, too.  There's just so much to love about it, from the engaging characters (engines) to the brightly colored 3-D graphics.  There's nothing slow or boring, either - it kept my 3-year-old's interest from beginning to end, and she asked me to replay the DVD after it had run through all of the episodes.  She's singing the theme song, too - it's so cute!  We're thinking about buying some of the Chuggington toy trains now that we've seen this and become attached to the characters.The lessons learned in each short episode are easily applied to a little one's daily life.  For instance, in the first episode, ""Braking Brewster"", Brewster learns about the importance of listening.  He couldn't remember if he was supposed to go downhill slow or fast (with a full load) and finds himself in a scary situation that a friend is able to help him out of safely.  The rest of the episodes are the same with everyday skills and lessons that you want your little one to learn introduced in a fun and entertaining way.",5,We Love Chuggington!,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",2011,1149,"['DVD', 'was', 'first', 'introduction', 'Chuggington', 'love', 'daughter', 'prefers', 'Thomas', 'Train', 'Engine', 'have', 'say', 'do', 'too', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'love', 'engaging', 'characters', 'engines', 'brightly', 'colored', '3-D', 'graphics', 'nothing', 'slow', 'boring', 'kept', '3-year-old', 'interest', 'beginning', 'end', 'asked', 'replay', 'DVD', 'had', 'run', 'episodes', 'singing', 'theme', 'song', 'too', 'so', 'cute', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'buying', 'Chuggington', 'toy', 'trains', 'now', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'become', 'attached', 'characters.The', 'lessons', 'learned', 'short', 'episode', 'are', 'easily', 'applied', 'little', 'one', 'daily', 'life', 'instance', 'first', 'episode', 'Braking', 'Brewster', 'Brewster', 'importance', 'listening', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'was', 'supposed', 'go', 'downhill', 'slow', 'fast', 'full', 'load', 'scary', 'situation', 'friend', 'able', 'help', 'safely', 'rest', 'episodes', 'are', 'same', 'everyday', 'skills', 'lessons', 'want', 'little', 'one', 'learn', 'introduced', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'way']",Chuggington: Let's Ride The Rails
