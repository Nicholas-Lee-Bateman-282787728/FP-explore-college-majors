I'm not an Owen Wilson or Jennifer Anistan fan but came away from this movie pleasantly surprised. They were not great by any stretch of the imagination but at least they didn't get in the way of the story. And the dog, anyone who has ever been around a lab can recognize Marleys behaviors too well (and why I don't own one). To put it plainly this is a dog my wife would have made me get rid of two days after bringing him home. He must have been the most destructive animal on the block for sure. In the end the movie pulled off what it intended to do: make you personify your own relationships and family into the film. Or, to put it plainly, see your own life and struggles in the story. Not hard to do when we all go through similar things. I give this 4 stars for the story which is a good one. The actors were not fantastic but the story compensated for them. Just my opinion.

Boston,"[4, 5]","I watched this movie(the single disc edition) on a whim thinking it was going to be a funny screwball comedy, which I don't usually like, but to tell you the truth, I watched it for the dogs. I just love animals and my pets, so I figured it would at least be mildly entertaining. It was a lot better and more heartfelt then I expected. I'm not a big fan of Jennifer Anniston, but she was very good in this and Owen Wilson was his normal funny, sweet self.If you have had or currently have any kind of pet, but especially a dog, I think this a great movie for you. For those without a pet, it might scare you! But it shows that no matter what your dog does, you still love him unconditionally, because they're a part of your family. You might want to ring their neck but they're just too adorable to be mad at for very long. The movie was laugh out loud funny and also heart wrenchingly sad at the end. It really spanned comedy into drama territory very nicely. Well paced and great acting.The only bummer was that the single disc edition only has some deleted scenes and a not so funny gag reel. If I had the choice I'd definitely grab the 2 disc edition, but that's only for those who are really into special features.",4,"The dog is part of the family, no questions asked",1238198400,"03 28, 2009",2009,1219,"['watched', 'movie', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'whim', 'thinking', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'funny', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'like', 'tell', 'truth', 'watched', 'dogs', 'just', 'love', 'animals', 'pets', 'figured', 'would', 'least', 'be', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'more', 'heartfelt', 'then', 'expected', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'was', 'normal', 'funny', 'sweet', 'self.If', 'have', 'had', 'currently', 'have', 'kind', 'pet', 'especially', 'dog', 'think', 'great', 'movie', 'pet', 'might', 'scare', 'matter', 'what', 'dog', 'still', 'love', 'unconditionally', ""'re"", 'part', 'family', 'might', 'want', 'ring', 'neck', ""'re"", 'just', 'too', 'adorable', 'be', 'mad', 'very', 'long', 'movie', 'was', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'also', 'heart', 'wrenchingly', 'sad', 'end', 'really', 'spanned', 'comedy', 'drama', 'territory', 'very', 'nicely', 'Well', 'paced', 'great', 'acting.The', 'only', 'bummer', 'was', 'single', 'disc', 'edition', 'only', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'not', 'so', 'funny', 'gag', 'reel', 'had', 'choice', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'grab', '2', 'disc', 'edition', 'only', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'special', 'features']",N/A

If you go into the movie with the understanding that the movie is basically a portrayal of a dog's life, you will have better understanding of what to expect and might enjoy the movie.I never read the book, which I would now like to do, but based on what I saw from the movie I have to say I really enjoyed it. I might be a little biased, however, because I went into the movie expecting the worst. I was already told beforehand what will happen to Marley at the end, but what I wasn't told was how it would happen. As I was watching the movie, I kept expecting some untimely tragic accident to take Marley's life which would have made it more heartwrenching, but that wasn't the case. The dog was eventually put down, yes, but that was because he was old, he had lived his life to the fullest. And for people who are upset over this, they need to realize that nothing lasts forever, unfortunately, but as I mentioned before the movie portrays the dog's life from infancy to old age, and yes, death is part of old age. I've had a few good dogs die on me, some before there time, and sometimes the hardest thing a person has to decide is when to let their best friend go.Another thing I wanted to point out is that they all had their second chance. They could have easily ended the movie with Marley's first visit to the hospital, but he came out of that okay. Sometimes that's all a person needs, is just a second chance to spend with somebody or something they love, to make amends for anything they might have done, and to say good-bye. I know what a second chance feels like because I've been there. And sometimes that second chance makes it easier to let go when it's finally time.",5,Great Movie,1238630400,"04 2, 2009",2009,1833,"['WARNING', 'SPOILERS', 'go', 'movie', 'expecting', 'comedy', 'family', 'dog', 'happy-go-lucky', 'ending', 'might', 'be', 'disappointed', 'go', 'movie', 'understanding', 'movie', 'basically', 'portrayal', 'dog', 'life', 'will', 'have', 'better', 'understanding', 'what', 'expect', 'might', 'enjoy', 'movie.I', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'now', 'like', 'do', 'based', 'what', 'saw', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'biased', 'however', 'went', 'movie', 'expecting', 'worst', 'was', 'already', 'told', 'beforehand', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Marley', 'end', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'told', 'was', 'how', 'would', 'happen', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'kept', 'expecting', 'untimely', 'tragic', 'accident', 'take', 'Marley', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'heartwrenching', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'dog', 'was', 'eventually', 'put', 'down', 'yes', 'was', 'was', 'old', 'had', 'lived', 'life', 'fullest', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'upset', 'need', 'realize', 'nothing', 'forever', 'unfortunately', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'dog', 'life', 'infancy', 'old', 'age', 'yes', 'death', 'part', 'old', 'age', ""'ve"", 'had', 'few', 'good', 'dogs', 'die', 'time', 'sometimes', 'hardest', 'thing', 'person', 'decide', 'when', 'let', 'best', 'friend', 'go.Another', 'thing', 'wanted', 'point', 'out', 'had', 'second', 'chance', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'ended', 'movie', 'Marley', 'first', 'visit', 'hospital', 'came', 'out', 'okay', 'person', 'needs', 'just', 'second', 'chance', 'spend', 'somebody', 'something', 'love', 'make', 'amends', 'anything', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'say', 'good-bye', 'know', 'what', 'second', 'chance', 'feels', ""'ve"", 'been', 'there', 'sometimes', 'second', 'chance', 'easier', 'let', 'go', 'when', 'finally', 'time']",N/A

1232943,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001REZM6K,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","My review title really doesn't have much merit as far as I'm concerned, since I tend to cry very easily, but in general I think that this is one of those films that will make the `manliest' of men tear up.  There is something about that four-legged bundle of fur that will get you every time, and I'm sure most men can remember the attachment they had to their first dog (and even their second, third and so on).It's that sentiment that carries `Marley & Me' to home plate.Adapted from his bestselling book, `Marley & Me' tells the story of John and Jennifer Grogan.  Shortly after getting married and moving to Florida, John discovers that Jennifer has her whole life practically planned out in a series of `steps'.  Her next step appears to be parenthood, which is a commitment John is not sure he's ready to handle.  Insert Marley, an adorable Labrador puppy who serves as a distraction from Jennifer's biological clock.  That puppy, as rambunctious and disobedient as can be, is also as precious and irreplaceable as can be and he accompanies the family on a whirlwind of experiences.  He becomes a defining character in the Grogan's lives, cementing himself as a family member (as Jennifer so beautifully puts it at the films closing).There is a lot of good here.  The acting is all very well done, especially by Jennifer Aniston.  I have to say that Owen Wilson is an actor I have a hard time taking seriously.  He is a `funny guy' and so when he does drama (which isn't very often) it's not very believable.  Much like his character (who has a knack for surprising even himself), he surprised me here.  I actually felt his emotional connection to the material, and he is especially effecting in the more tender and dramatic scenes, which is not something I expected.  Jennifer Aniston is in top form here, nailing every ounce of her characters emotional well being.  She is quirking and fun and she is frustrated yet lovable, and she is even borderline insane, all the while remaining wholly believable.And then there is Marley, cute, lovable, `want to strangle him' Marley.  Without the dog this movie wouldn't work, and all 22 of them work magic on every frame.I do have a few minor issues with the film though, so I'll get into those here.  I wanted more from Alan Arkin.  I'll just get that off right now since it is the least of the films issues.  He's not a big player and not a priority, but I rather like his dry sense of humor and so I expected a lot from him.  He was kind of dull here.  The bigger issue I have is with the script work.  For the most part it's very well done, mixing well the Grogan's life and their life with Marley so that it felt less like a `dog movie' and more like a movie about people who own a dog.  The thing is, at times the film can feel like it's taking on too much.  It starts to run long in the end and there are sections of the film that feel redundant because they are taking on too much.  It's not `frequent' but it is enough to become noticeable.  I few tweaks and some cutting could have helped the movie a tad.That said, these few faults don't take away from the films finale, which is a whopper.  Overall I really liked this movie.  It was very, very good; nearly great even.  For any dog lover, this is a must see; but more than that, if you are a fan of family fare that is moving, heartwarming and memorable then this is a movie for you.",4,Leave it to a misbehaved dog to make a grown man cry...,1241395200,"05 4, 2009",2009,3395,"['review', 'title', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'merit', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'tend', 'cry', 'very', 'easily', 'general', 'think', 'one', 'films', 'will', 'make', 'manliest', 'men', 'tear', 'up', 'something', 'four-legged', 'bundle', 'fur', 'will', 'get', 'time', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'men', 'can', 'remember', 'attachment', 'had', 'first', 'dog', 'even', 'second', 'third', 'so', '.It', 'sentiment', 'Marley', 'Me', 'home', 'plate.Adapted', 'bestselling', 'book', 'Marley', 'Me', 'story', 'John', 'Jennifer', 'Grogan', 'Shortly', 'getting', 'married', 'moving', 'Florida', 'John', 'Jennifer', 'whole', 'life', 'practically', 'planned', 'out', 'series', 'steps', 'next', 'step', 'be', 'parenthood', 'commitment', 'John', 'not', 'sure', 'ready', 'handle', 'Insert', 'Marley', 'adorable', 'Labrador', 'puppy', 'who', 'distraction', 'Jennifer', 'biological', 'clock', 'puppy', 'rambunctious', 'disobedient', 'can', 'be', 'also', 'as', 'precious', 'irreplaceable', 'can', 'be', 'family', 'whirlwind', 'experiences', 'defining', 'character', 'Grogan', 'lives', 'cementing', 'family', 'member', 'Jennifer', 'beautifully', 'films', 'closing', 'lot', 'good', 'here', 'acting', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'have', 'say', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'actor', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'taking', 'seriously', 'funny', 'guy', 'so', 'when', 'drama', ""n't"", 'very', 'often', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'Much', 'character', 'who', 'knack', 'surprising', 'even', 'surprised', 'here', 'actually', 'felt', 'emotional', 'connection', 'material', 'especially', 'effecting', 'more', 'tender', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'not', 'something', 'expected', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'top', 'form', 'here', 'nailing', 'ounce', 'characters', 'emotional', 'well', 'being', 'quirking', 'fun', 'frustrated', 'yet', 'lovable', 'even', 'borderline', 'insane', 'while', 'remaining', 'wholly', 'believable.And', 'then', 'Marley', 'cute', 'lovable', 'want', 'strangle', 'Marley', 'dog', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', '22', 'work', 'magic', 'frame.I', 'do', 'have', 'few', 'minor', 'issues', 'film', ""'ll"", 'get', 'here', 'wanted', 'more', 'Alan', 'Arkin', ""'ll"", 'just', 'get', 'off', 'right', 'now', 'least', 'films', 'issues', 'not', 'big', 'player', 'not', 'priority', 'rather', 'dry', 'sense', 'humor', 'so', 'expected', 'lot', 'was', 'kind', 'dull', 'here', 'bigger', 'issue', 'have', 'script', 'work', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'mixing', 'well', 'Grogan', 'life', 'life', 'Marley', 'felt', 'less', 'dog', 'movie', 'more', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'own', 'dog', 'thing', 'times', 'film', 'can', 'feel', 'taking', 'too', 'much', 'run', 'long', 'end', 'are', 'sections', 'film', 'feel', 'redundant', 'are', 'taking', 'too', 'much', 'not', 'frequent', 'enough', 'become', 'noticeable', 'few', 'tweaks', 'cutting', 'could', 'have', 'helped', 'movie', 'tad.That', 'said', 'few', 'faults', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'films', 'finale', 'whopper', 'Overall', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'nearly', 'great', 'even', 'dog', 'lover', 'must', 'see', 'more', 'are', 'fan', 'family', 'fare', 'moving', 'heartwarming', 'memorable', 'then', 'movie']",N/A

1232945,A2USVBMAB7GRKI,B001REZM6K,andy g,"[1, 1]","Its saturday feb 22nd 750pm. my name is andy and today It was with great sadness that I had to give my beloved little flower WHITNEY to god and st. martin, patriot saint of animals. I would like to tell you all alittle bit about her if I may. WHITNEY was my best friend in the whole world! She did everything that a loving pet was supposed do. In all my goodtimes bad times hurtful painfull times she was there for me. Making me feel better and easing whatever pain I was feeling at the time. I could always count on her laying her little head on my lap as if to say &#34;its ok dad im here&#34;. WHITNEY came into my life 15 years ago the size of a little mouse. she was a caryn terrier lite brown hair the most soothing beautiful dark eyes. And an angelic face and the biggest heart a little dog could have. She was given to me and I didnt want her or any pet for that matter at that time and it took me awhile to get used to her. yes I loved animals but i just didnt want one. Lo and behold I fell for her charms and occasional riff raff that a typical puppy will cause. Her love was so unconditional thru her whole life to me and me to her. About 4 months later a friend brought me a companion for Whitney so she woundnt be lonely while I was at work. &#34;&#34;PIP&#34; is also a very loving pet, a west highland terrier. They both took to each other right away. I had my little family. PIP is currently 14 years old and still is very vivacious, healthy and frisky. Of course they both had there share of medical trips in there life i.e. shots. They both got ear hematomas but came thru it successfully.  Whitney startd coughing late last year in the summer. It progressed and eventually got worse. It was hard for her to breath and eat. She had tumors growing in her throat (of all places). Doctors went in and successfully got one out in sept. She was back to her old happy self eating all she wants and wanting to be with me watching tv and movies. In late nov another one had grown in the same area. doctors went in and got that out and successfully. With 2 surgeries already behind her and being that she was already 15 I wasnt going to grant her a 3rd.  The first 2 surguries were very scary and risky being where the tumors were. my vet doctors came thru and she pulled thru both surgeries successfully BUT they told me they could not get them all the smaller ones and that they would grow slowly. I had my baby thru the holidays thankfully. She was happy, very energetic for her age, loved her walks with me and pip, ate good and we shared christmas together just the 3 of us. But the middle part of jan she was coughing and gagging once again. I was by this point preparing myself for what was to come. My god it hurt me soo much to hear her coughing violently and her breathing sounded awfull. Only thing doctors could do was prescribe pet steroids to open her troat so she could breath and eat. That worked for awhile but it wasnt a cure. the only thing i could do is try and make her as comfortable as i could. I would carry her just about anywhere in the house. I was hand feeding her cuz she couldnt eat like she used to. Shed wake up late at night coughing up a storm so I would be up with her soothing her as best as i could. oh lord how i would cry and i was so stressed out. I was losing the best friend and companion i ever had in my life. This morning, she didnt get up she just stayed asleep not even wanting to go outside to do her business with pip like always. She would just cough and wheeze while asleep. I knew the time had come. I knew my Whitney was asking me in her own way for me to take the pain away that she was feeling. I picked her up and she did go out and do her final business outside and sniffed the grass like she always did. In the car she was just lying down wheras normally she'd be excited barking up a storm. None of that happened. We got to the vet and it would be her final stop. All i could do is keep holding her and telling her &#34;no more coughing babies no more just go to sleep now ill see you again you were such a good pet to me and ill never ever forget you&#34;.

There were some weak scenes in the movie but overall the film was about how a family dealt with life's obstacles specifically with a very misbehaved dog.Those of us who have had the privelage to care for a dog know what I am talking about. My wife and I just lost our dog, Cooper, early last year. He was quite sick and we made a decision, like John Grogan did, to let him go on our terms: happy and without any further pain. This film was definitely by far not a children's movie hence the PG rating. What I don't understand is why the negative reviewers don't understand what PG means (uhmm, PARENTAL GUIDANCE, which means EXPLAIN to your child). A lot of other reviewers (and some commentators) are correct in that life is not a bunch of peachs & cream (my words).I also don't know what movie some of these negative reviewers saw but I sure didn't see any sex acts. Maybe they were actually looking for the supposed sex acts. I did see a scene of implied nudity but no outright nudity itself.Overall, the movie was really good.

1232949,A32T2H8150OJLU,B001REZM6K,ARH,"[1, 2]","I watched ""Marley and Me"" a couple of times over the past few days, and it's easy to see why this film earned 5 stars from some reviewers and 1 star from others.Here are some things to consider if you are thinking about picking up a copy of this DVD:1) This film is about a huge, strong, active dog and the two people that he ""owns"".  If you are a dog-owner/lover, that should be a plus for this film for you.2) If you are not a dog owner or dog lover, this film will confirm all of the stereotypically bad things you have ever seen or heard about dogs.3) The dog-centered ""one-joke"" storyline has a tendency to get old after a while - you know, dog runs, owner chases, dog runs, owner chases, dog chews things up, owner...you know.  If I had a dog like Marley it'd drive me crazy.4) Of course, the film runs full circle and eventually highlights the bond that often develops between people and dogs, to the extent that dogs are taken into our inner family circles...and all that bond brings with it.5) There are, I must say, some memorable lines and scenes in this film, some of which can make you laugh out loud.6) I liked the main actors and their characters, but, to be completely frank, Owen Wilson's hair bugged me all the way through the show.  Don't ask me why...maybe it's because I expected him to do some growing up and developing as the film moved along...but that never happened7) My favorite character in the film was Alan Arkin - the somewhat crusty newspaper editor.8) Lastly, who is the film supposed to target?  From the DVD cover you'd expect this to he a children's movie.  That's not the case...while it may look like it's being marketed to the younger kid crew (elementary school or younger ages) this is not a film for little kids.  I'd say that the appropriate audience for this film should not start much below 12-yr olds or so, since there are some dicy scenes that make you wonder even about them.  At the same time, this film doesn't really target grown-up audiences either!  I found some of the bits to be funny and engaging, but at other times, mainly adolescent.  And this film doesn't work just for adolescents...our teens watched it, and they thought it was ""cute.""  That's it, ""cute.""Anyway, it does work to some extent for audiences from older children through grown-ups.  It does generate a wide range of emotions, and highlights some of the major challenges of getting started, working, rearing a family, and surviving ""the worst dog in the world.""I think that most people will enjoy this film, but it does not rate 5 stars, or maybe even 4 atars in my opinion...hm...3.5?I am glad that I saw this film. but I can't say that I'm going to go out of my way to recommend it to anyone...so, 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars.

I actually enjoyedMarmadukemore because they didn't deal with the animal's final moments and they included the dog's point of view.  One is always so joyous over a puppy or even a young dog, but no matter how long-lived the breed, for a loving family it is NEVER long enough.  The pain of the last ""goodbye"" is in direct proportion to the amount of love one feels for the animal, and it is a moot point when dealing with the anguish of loss over a good and loyal friend and family member whether it is worth going through it ever again with another.Anyone with a pet of any kind will understand the ups and downs of the Grogans and their Labrador Marley.  I gather from the content that the movie is based on a true story, which I can believe.  Though I didn't have as much trouble with my Great Dane Courageous, I had at least some of the issues.  (If you think a Lab can drag you along on a ""walk,"" try walking a 175# Great Dane!)While some reviewers suggest that the movie isn't for children, I have to disagree.  I suspect small children will deal better with the end than adults will; I'm always amazed at the resilience of children.  Perhaps it's that they have no clue about what dying really means.  Having worked in Pediatrics, both in ICU and in bone marrow transplant, I can say they are a whole lot more stoic about the prospect than adults are, even when it's the possibility of their own death that looms.  I think the end of the dog's life was dealt with well and would help children understand and deal with a forthcoming loss in their own lives.  One can collapse into an hour and half the entire life of a dog, see its contributions to family life, understand that everyone gets old, that sometimes even though it's sad for us because the family member or pet is no longer with us, death comes as a natural thing, even a welcome thing at the end of a well spent life.Dogs have a lot to teach us.",4,Dogs have a lot to teach us.,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",2011,1971,"['was', 'cute', 'movie', 'oh', 'so', 'hard', 'watch', 'end', 'actually', 'enjoyedMarmadukemore', 'did', ""n't"", 'deal', 'animal', 'final', 'moments', 'included', 'dog', 'point', 'view', 'One', 'always', 'so', 'joyous', 'puppy', 'even', 'young', 'dog', 'matter', 'how', 'long-lived', 'breed', 'loving', 'family', 'NEVER', 'long', 'enough', 'pain', 'last', 'goodbye', 'direct', 'proportion', 'amount', 'love', 'one', 'feels', 'animal', 'moot', 'point', 'when', 'dealing', 'anguish', 'loss', 'good', 'loyal', 'friend', 'family', 'member', 'worth', 'going', 'ever', 'again', 'another.Anyone', 'pet', 'kind', 'will', 'understand', 'ups', 'downs', 'Grogans', 'Labrador', 'Marley', 'gather', 'content', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'can', 'believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'trouble', 'Great', 'Dane', 'Courageous', 'had', 'least', 'issues', 'think', 'Lab', 'can', 'drag', 'along', 'walk', 'try', 'walking', '175', 'Great', 'Dane', 'reviewers', 'suggest', 'movie', ""n't"", 'children', 'have', 'disagree', 'suspect', 'small', 'children', 'will', 'deal', 'better', 'end', 'adults', 'will', ""'m"", 'always', 'amazed', 'resilience', 'children', 'Perhaps', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'dying', 'really', 'Having', 'worked', 'Pediatrics', 'ICU', 'bone', 'marrow', 'transplant', 'can', 'say', 'are', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'stoic', 'prospect', 'adults', 'are', 'even', 'when', 'possibility', 'own', 'death', 'think', 'end', 'dog', 'life', 'was', 'dealt', 'well', 'would', 'help', 'children', 'understand', 'deal', 'forthcoming', 'loss', 'own', 'lives', 'One', 'can', 'collapse', 'hour', 'entire', 'life', 'dog', 'see', 'contributions', 'family', 'life', 'understand', 'everyone', 'old', 'sometimes', 'even', 'sad', 'family', 'member', 'pet', 'longer', 'death', 'natural', 'thing', 'even', 'welcome', 'thing', 'end', 'well', 'spent', 'life.Dogs', 'have', 'lot', 'teach']",N/A

One of those laugh, then think about it, then feel vaguely guilty for laughing types of movies. So I will confess right up: I did laugh, and in the touching scenes, I almost but not quite cried.In one sense, the advertising about this movie is deceptive. Marley begins life as a totally adorable puppy, but that phase ends very quickly and the rest is about him as an totally uncontrolled adult. His owners, being an earnest and honest young couple (both writers on newspapers, but different papers), take him to obedience school, where the instructor provides some amusing scenes and then declares him completely un-trainable and orders them to take him away and never bring him back.Much of the story revolves around his chewing things up, including especially his leather leash, so as to run free unexpectedly. They never thought of buying a chain leash. And if any family really lost that much furniture and clothing and other essentials to a dog's urge to chew, wouldn't they have learned much earlier to buy him a nice large rawhide bone-shaped toy, which is how he managed to contain himself (for awhile anyway) when he owners rushed to the hospital to have their first baby. I'd have bought him a whole case of chew toys if he was mine, and saved thousands of dollars replacing furniture.But then they were apparently growing quite wealthy, in large part because John Grogan (played by Owen Wilson) was writing a successful newspaper column in which the antics of Marley played a critical part. Maybe they were afraid if he got any discipline, the writing wouldn't be funny anymore. But they had three kids by the time he took a job with the Philadelphia Inquirer and moved from Florida. The house they bought was one of those marvelous old field-stone farmhouses which dot the Pennsylvania landscape. Since it is described as ""just outside of Philly,"" it was most likely on the Main Line, which is a very money sort of area. Big old house, lots of trees, big yard, all old growth landscape -- we are talking real money. Enough to be able to replace furniture Marley chews up.Do I sound like I am resentful with envy? Perhaps I am. These two attractive people have together just exactly what I would have done if I could have. Still, they are nice people, their kids are nice people, and Marley can be charming when he wants to be.But dogs do not live as long as humans, and so we have the inevitable death scene.

It is a little bit, but it's more along the lines of romantic comedy, with some drama elements.  It's not a straight up comedy.There are plenty of funny moments though.  Marley (the dog) was a complete MANIAC!  It was interesting how the owners tried to take the dog to obedient school, and they said the dog was WAY too out of control to be trained, haha.  Any attempt at training the dog failed hard and fast.Marley would constantly chew up important things around the house, run around doing crazy things, and just have the time of his life being the boss.  Even when the dog got older, he would STILL be chewing constantly.  Apparently nothing worked, so the family just had to live with his uncontrollable behavior.When the family eventually had kids, this is when the family questioned whether it was a good idea to keep the dog, since Marley would not settle down for anything.What's surprising to me, is that, the ending is *extremely sad*.  Trust me, for all you dog lovers out there (including me) the ending to this film will make you cry.  I promise it will.  In fact, this ending hit WAY too close to home since I found myself in the same situation three years ago, with the same kind of dog, and the same kind of ending happened to me.Because of the ending, I'm not so sure it's a good idea for animal lovers to watch Marley and Me.  You can sense an ending like that was going to happen eventually because throughout the movie there was this eerie and awkward silence that seemed to indicate it was drawing near.  I just don't want to spoil the ending and reveal what that ""it"" is.Marley and Me is a fantastic movie with a shocking ending, and a movie that should only be watched if you can handle such a sad ending.

So it shouldn't surprise many that this film (and the book it is directly based on) can get that lump started in your throat and make your eyes well-up.The correlation between being a pet owner is strong. Most of us probably had a dog when we were growing up and that poor mongrel must've meant a lot. We always remember the name of our first dog-love. We played with `em, fed them, and watched them grow old and die. It is a powerful moment in all our lives to witness the death of a beloved friend, be him human or not.So MARLEY & ME drills right to the core of that relationship. I don't fault the writer or director for using this type of ploy. It gets the audience seriously involved at an emotional level. Have two wannabe parents decide on their first dog (Marley). Raise him along with themselves, their careers, and their children. Watch him terrorize and destroy your home, your privacy, your car (insert laughs), and then have him slow down as he begins to gray. Finally, the decision comes: what to do with the old guy when he can't raise himself onto his feet anymore. Watching kids say goodbye to him will be the highest emotional point for most film viewers; I can feel that old knot starting in my throat already!The great thing about the film is that it does touch on those memories we have. I have such great ones of my first dog that I broke out some pictures and looked at them after watching Marley & Me. But it didn't make me want to buy another one. I don't own a dog and don't want one. They do exactly what Marley does: they die on you.The downside to the film is that it is completely predictable and only so-so acted. Much of the book is incorporated so lovers of the novel will probably cheer about that. But there were some edits, obviously. The only one that bugged me was when Marley and owner John Grogan (Owen Wilson,Cars) went to find out about a crime in their neighborhood which eventually made John and his wife Jennifer (Jennifer Aniston,The Break-Up) decide to move to another, safer area (in the book this is pretty well spelled-out but in the movie it isn't clear why they move).Still, the movie is a good diversion with plenty of heart-string tugging that'll make you travel down your own doggy memory-lane.",3,Who Cried When Ol' Yeller Got Shot?

In a nutshell, it is a movie that shows the arch of a couple's life who happens to have a dog.  The story itself isn't anything out of the ordinary.  The characters in the movie are just regular people that we probably all know.  Marley, although the 'Grogans' will beg to differ, is just an adorable lab just like yours and mine (Okay he may be a tad bit crazier).  The seemingly 'normal' story of a family is what makes the movie unique.  The movie spans for about 15 years.  It starts with a newly married couple starting out in their careers.  At this time they adopt a puppy.  And the puppy goes through the great journey of life with this beautiful couple: having babies, new job, old job, marriage struggles etc.  The movie definitely runs at a different pace to other movies.  There's no huge drama, there's no hilarious and frustrating struggles with crazy in-laws.  Nobody cheats on anybody.  Nobody chases anyone driving at a thousand miles per hour.  Nothing traumatic happens.  Basically, there's no climax.  But that's probably more realistic.  As other reviewers say, Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson make a nice couple.

1232976,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001REZM6K,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","My expectations for this film were not high. It is a very pleasant, sweet film, that captures John Grogan's writing style well.If anyone expects this to be some fabulous chef d'oeuvre of cinema, something that moves the world of film forward; they will be very disappointed. But if the reason to watch this film is to see a wonderful, entertaining, touching, family film; then the viewer will be well rewarded for nearly 2 hours.The story is so simple, it's more or less John Grogan's life from just before he acquires a puppy, Marley, to just after the sad ending. It's about the small things that happen in life. About the connection people have with pets, or dogs.There are many things that are not perfect about this film. Owen Wilson is not the best choice for John Grogan (Jennifer Anniston defends herself well); there are continuity problems (especially with the cars that are parked in the Grogan driveway); pacing isn't exactly the most perfect in the world; dog details are somewhat off; focus and sound aren't always perfect. Yes it is a flawed film.But, and it's a big one, the story is so sweet, so compelling, and just the right number of jokes allowed this viewer and his family (spouse, and 18 and 12 year old boys) to overlook those flaws. The dog moments are wonderful. There are some very good solid laughs.A wonderful movie to watch with your family.The film is rated PG and that's about right. There's a small amount of strong language. No nudity, except for infants. There is a bedroom scene with Jennifer and John, here the 12 year old simply looked the other way. There's a skinny dipping scene, all done with suggestion of nudity. There is no violence explicitly shown (a young neighbor is stabbed off camera and John comforts her while they await the police). There is much more violence and disturbing story lines in the Disney world of movies. This is an all ages movie.The DVD includes a gag reel that was surprisingly good. Deleted scenes was interesting, three of these scenes should have been in the movie, and other scenes should have been tightened up. And lastly, the trailers.

With that out of the way, let us get on with the review...*Spoilers*""What I know is that I have a tendency to surprise myself..."" This quote from Marley and Me is not only a great line, but it really captures the spirit of this movie in a nutshell. What is most surprising to me is how you find yourself pulling for the worst dog in the world, and his ever growing master, and their ever growing family, regardless of their situation as they endures life's ups and downs.This movie basically follows a par of newly wed reporters as they move to Miami, get a job, a dog, a column, have kids, etc. The dog, of course, is the worst dog in the world. The job (for the guy anyway) is ""gas-leak"" type reporting, which leaves his big-shot reporting dreams unsatisfied. The column is a temp job, and his success makes the job stick, but still leaves him with unsatisfied big-shot reporting dreams. The kids make the wife leave her job and stay home, causing unfulfillment stress in her life. So, basically, if you follow me here, this is a ""real life"" true story which has a lot you can connect with...The unifying theme to it all is Marley (named after Bob Marley) whose only outstanding trait is his ability to excel at being awful. This dog has no redeeming qualities except in the eyes of his family, and somehow, that is good enough. You find yourself rooting for this dog, just because he is so inept at domestic life, it is absolutely comical. I imagine it would be a much different story for most people, should they actually own such a beast, but watching it on the celluloid is family entertainment at its best. It is the one dog anti-dog-show dog show, the display of a dog with no manners, who has made no attempt to live with any kind of dignity, whatsoever.The film detracts a bit from the ""real life"" story in the fact that they use actors who to me don't really sell their parts convincingly. Owen Wilson cannot seam to pull off affectionate scenes without his trademark observational banter to fill in the spaces, and Jennifer Aniston doesn't seem to fit the expressive ""emotional cheerleader"" role that the wife's lines seem to portray. I would rather have seen some no-names with good acting skills cast as the leads here rather than watching a couple of mega stars do their periodic obligatory romantic comedy. This script screams ""real world"" and the casting screams ""big budget formula comedy."" While I suppose a case could be made for Owen Wilson, and Jennifer Anniston for being the best boy and girl next door in Hollywood, I still don't think they pulled it off in this one.Overall, a very good movie, with some really good scenes. I found myself ready for the show to end with the mellodrama of the climax, but overall the pacing of the feel good moments with the comedy terror was just about perfect.I really enjoyed this movie, and I am not into these kinds of movies.

1232982,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B001REZM6K,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 7]","Moving, enjoyable and heartbreaking!  Are you ready for for a film that is one heck of an emotional roller coaster?  `Marley & Me' is no doubt going to make the dog lover in you, laugh and cry!""Marley & Me"" is film based on a New york Times bestselling autobiographical book by journalist John Grogan in 2005.  The film is directed by David Frankel (""The Devil Wears Prada"" and has directed television episodes for ""Entourage "", ""Sex and the City"" and ""Band of Brothers"" with a screenplay by Scott Frank (""The Intepreter"", ""Minority Report"") and Don Roose (""Bounce"", ""Single White Female"").The film is about John Grogan (Owen Wilson) and Jennifer Grogan (Jennifer Aniston), two writers who are just married and they begin their years as reporters in Florida.  But before they have any children, Jennifer starts off with plants and then the couple move on to adopting a golden retriever who John names Marley (after reggae legend Bob Marley).Marley is an active, always hungry, strong, quick and somewhat of a hyper dog who loves attention from his owners.  Of course, this leads Marley to causing a lot of trouble from breaking things in the home, eating the cushions of pillows and the couch, in one scene eating a gold necklace given as a present from John to Jennifer and even getting kicked out of obedience school.  But despite the trouble he may have caused, both John and Jennifer love Marley as part of the family.But the overall film features on the 13-years of the Grogan family and growing up with Marley.What works for this film is that it strikes the right chords for any couple or family that has had a pet in their life and knowing the love (and sometimes trouble) that a pet could bring into ones life, but cherishing the moment that the pet is with you, just like a family member.  From the beginning of when they were puppies to the end of a dog's life.""Marley & Me"" is given special treatment in the Blu-ray release from 20th Century Fox as we are given a total of three discs.  The first disc is the Blu-ray, the second disc is a DVD and the third is a digital copy of the film.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Marley & Me"" looks absolute beautiful on Blu-ray.  With so much of the film shot outdoors and during the day and in a variety of locations capturing the beach life, the rains and even snow in Philadelphia, the film is just vibrant in colors and with the video featured in widescreen 2:35:1 at 1080p, overall I was impressed of how vibrant this film looked. Director of Photography Florian Ballhaus has experience shooting beautiful scenes from working on a film like ""Devil Wears Prada"" to working on television series such as ""Sex and the City"".  He manages to capture the mood, the action and the whole vibe of Florida and then later in Philadelphia.  There were a lot of shots filmed for ""Marley & Me"", especially during a segment where the film tries to explain how the couple has grown and as does Marley.  Overall, ""Marley & Me"" is very colorful and beautiful picture quality.As for audio, audio is presented in DTS HD 5.1 Master Lossless Audio.  The film is primarily a dialogue-based film but also utilizes a great deal of music.  So, you really get a good projection from your front channel and center speakers when it comes to hearing the audio.  The Blu-ray also comes with the Spanish, French and Portuguese audio track in 5.1 Dolby Surround.The film is subtitled in Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:For the special features of ""Marley & Me"", the following features are included on the Blu-ray Disc:* Dog Training Trivia Track - When this is selected, you can watch the film with pop up trivia and facts about dogs.  Plus picture-in-picture videos with interviews with the trainers of the 22 dogs used in the film.* 19 Deleted Scenes With Director, David Frankel Commentary - About 26 minutes in all, the deleted scenes features optional commentary by Director David Frankel.  Deleted scenes include shots with Marley as a puppy but since the focus was to showcase the family and Marley grown up, the puppy scenes were cut.  Also, scenes with the couple's neighbors were deleted due to pacing and also what was important in the storyline.* Finding Marley featurette - An eight minute featurette with an Interview with trainer Mark Forbes and other trainers in regarding using 22 dogs who were Marley.  Half were puppies and half were older dogs.  Some were able to do scenes such as peeing on cue, humping on cue, etc.* Breaking the Golden Rule featurette - An eight minute featurette featuring interviews with Owen Wilson, Jennifer Aniston, Kathleen Turner and others in regarding to working with children, working with dogs, about raising families and what made ""Marley & Me"" special.* On Set with Marley: Dog of All Trades featurette - A near three minute featurette featuring an interview with Marley.  An interviewer interviews Marley  with text bubbles shown above the dog.* Animal Adoption featurette - A five minute featurette about animal adoption with an interview with Dr. Pia Salk and tips on adopting a dog and also how purebreds can be found at animal shelters and how many shelters have improved over the years.* Gag Reel - A six minute gag reel featuring the group having fun on set and messing up on their lines.* When Not to Pee featurette- A two minute featurette about the segment featuring Marley having to pee in the Grogan's home after they return from Ireland.  The film used two dogs.  Clyde as the primary dog during this segment.  But since he can not pee on cue, the golden lab Brody was used.  The film was difficult to shoot and the featurette was about how difficult it was to get that one shot.JUDGMENT CALL:I have to admit that watching ""Marley & Me"" was very difficult (mainly at the end).Like the Grogan couple, I'm sure many couples can put themselves in the shoes of the Grogan's of raising dogs before children and for many years, the dog is part of your family and over the years, watching the animal grow.  But it's when the dog gets older and you notice how difficult it becomes for them to walk, to jump and its a very sad situation to watch your dog struggling to do things that you would remember them doing for so many years.  But of course, it's the saying goodbye to your dog when it's their time, that makes it so difficult and from my situation with my dog, it was nearly the exact same situation.  The feeling of being powerless but knowing that you want your dog to no longer suffer.So, ""Marley & Me"" is a moving, hilarious and heartbreaking film.  It's definitely an emotional roller coaster of a film that you probably will want to have the tissue box nearby because if you are a pet owner or have lost a pet, those emotions will just come back and tug at your heart.As for the acting, personally I found Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston fun to watch onscreen.  I've read a few reviews of the film when it was first released and it seems you have those who had pets really enjoying the film and those who never had pets wanting to see more focus on the couple.  Both talents have always been known for their work in romantic comedies but both had significant emotional scenes and for the most part I feel the pulled it off. For Owen Wilson, you get that sense of sarcastic bad boy from his ""Bottle Rocket"" to ""Wedding Crashers"" years but in the end, I felt he did a good job.The film is not a film that has a deep storyline or a significant plot.  It's a story about life and a couple starting off as a married couple, raising a dog before they have children, the complications of balancing job and parental duties and financial worries.  These are experiences that many people can easily understand.If there was anything that I did have a problem with the film is that at 115 minutes, it was a bit long.  And the fact that the film had so many deleted scenes, it could have gone longer.  But I'm sure it was difficult for Director David Frankel to decide what to edit out.  Because there were some deleted scenes that go into character development of John, Jennifer and even the neighbors and so, for pacing reasons, a lot was cut out already.  After watching the film, I wouldn't know where would I begin to cut out 10-15 minutes more.Also, another problem was having Eric Dane's character of Sebastian who was important in the first half, all of a sudden being thrown into the second half.  Personally, it was scene that could have easily eliminated a bit of time in the final cut but I suppose the director wanted to show the difference of what if John chose career over family and pursued a similar life that Sebastian has lived.But overall, I enjoyed ""Marley and Me"".  And on Blu-ray, the film really shines because high definition brings out the vibrancy of the film.  It's a colorful film and it just looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray.Bundled with plenty of special features and the fact that the film does come with a DVD (for those long commutes for the family) and also a digital copy, you definitely get a good deal with this Blu-ray release and I can only hope that 20th Century Fox continues with the 3-disc treatment for their Blu-rays (as long as it's priced affordably for the consumer).There have been quite a good number of dog films with a similar feel of growing up with a dog such as the Japanese film ""Quill"" (which I highly recommend) and the film ""My Dog Skip"". But ""Marley & Me"" is a film that is just fun to watch but also is going to make you cry.I enjoyed the film and if you are a dog owner/lover, I think that you will enjoy this film too!  ""Marley & Me: 3-Disc Bad Dog Edition"" is definitely recommended!",5,"Moving, enjoyable and heartbreaking!

1232985,AC63924IPU3IS,B001REZM6K,"DKMI ""dkmi""","[4, 5]","First, let me start by stating that I did not read the book.  I am a dog owner and consider my dog a part of our family.  For me, this movie wasn't as good as the reviews here would suggest.  Many of us have had a dog at one time or another, so there is plenty in this movie to identify with.  My problem wasn't with Marley at all.  It was with Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston.  I never once forgot that I was watching Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston.  I didn't buy either of them in this film.  We never really got a sense of either character in this film.  My feeling is that many of the positive reviewers here either let their favorable feelings for these actors cloud their judgement or they let it be clouded by the fact that, as dog owners, they have gone through similar situations.The story is OK.  Owen's character, John, is a newspaper reporter who takes a job that he is good at (columnist) even though he thinks he should be reporting straight news.  Jennifer plays John's wife.  She too is a reporter of some sort, however we never see these people actually involved in their work.  All we ever see of Owen's work is his brief, somewhat awkward, conversations with his boss (played by Alan Arkin).  There is a significant disconnect from the man and his career.  His career is a very important part of the story, yet I feel it was glossed over.  Jennifer Aniston never convinced me that she was a housewife either.  It's hard to ignore that she looks the exact same at the end of the movie as she does in the beginning.So what does that leave us with?  Well, I guess it would be the relationship between John and Jen - sort of.  Frankly, their time together on screen wasn't magical.  In one scene at a doctor's office, there was a chance for an emotional connection between the two, but it never materialized.  Then the movie must have been a cute dog movie, right?  Wrong.  Marley wasn't really the star of this movie either.  To be fair, I don't believe that the story was intended to star Marley.  There's scenes of Marley getting into things, chewing furniture, and pulling his owners, but those scenes (of which there are plenty) aren't really about Marley.  I think the point was trying to be made to show Marley as a dysfunctional, but important member of the family.We first see Marley as a puppy, and time goes by as the family grows with the arrival of three children.  The ending is inevitable.  Honestly, the last 20 or so minutes were the best part of this movie.  Only then do we see Marley as what he really was - a companion and family member.  It tugs at our hearts when Marley is in distress and the ultimate decision has to be made.  Many of us have been there, and it isn't fun.  A nice scene toward the end is when the oldest son watches old home videos and we see that Marley was there for every family milestone.  Marley was in every shot.The last part of the movie made it worth watching.  I didn't find Marley's antics leading up to the ending to be all that funny.  We've all seen dogs pull their owners around and get into things they shouldn't get into.  Owen and Jennifer's reactions aren't particulary hilarious either.  That leaves us with the drama, which really isn't that dramatic.If you're considering buying this movie, wait a bit.  It's sure to end up in the bargain bin rather quickly.  For me, watching it once was enough.  I plan on reading this book to see how it differs from the film.  The book was a huge hit, so I'm hoping that the book makes up for what the movie lacked.",3,A Little Over-Hyped,1239235200,"04 9, 2009",2009,3534,"['First', 'let', 'start', 'stating', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'am', 'dog', 'owner', 'consider', 'dog', 'part', 'family', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'reviews', 'here', 'would', 'suggest', 'Many', 'have', 'had', 'dog', 'one', 'time', 'plenty', 'movie', 'identify', 'problem', 'was', ""n't"", 'Marley', 'was', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'never', 'once', 'forgot', 'was', 'watching', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'sense', 'character', 'film', 'feeling', 'many', 'positive', 'reviewers', 'here', 'either', 'let', 'favorable', 'feelings', 'actors', 'cloud', 'judgement', 'let', 'be', 'clouded', 'fact', 'that', 'dog', 'owners', 'have', 'gone', 'similar', 'situations.The', 'story', 'OK.', 'Owen', 'character', 'John', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'who', 'job', 'good', 'columnist', 'even', 'should', 'be', 'reporting', 'straight', 'news', 'Jennifer', 'John', 'wife', 'too', 'reporter', 'sort', 'however', 'never', 'see', 'people', 'actually', 'involved', 'work', 'ever', 'see', 'Owen', 'work', 'brief', 'somewhat', 'awkward', 'conversations', 'boss', 'played', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'significant', 'disconnect', 'man', 'career', 'career', 'very', 'important', 'part', 'story', 'feel', 'was', 'glossed', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'never', 'convinced', 'was', 'housewife', 'either', 'hard', 'ignore', 'exact', 'same', 'end', 'movie', 'beginning.So', 'what', 'leave', 'Well', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'relationship', 'John', 'Jen', 'sort', 'Frankly', 'time', 'together', 'screen', 'was', ""n't"", 'magical', 'one', 'scene', 'doctor', 'office', 'was', 'chance', 'emotional', 'connection', 'two', 'never', 'materialized', 'Then', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'cute', 'dog', 'movie', 'right', 'Wrong', 'Marley', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'star', 'movie', 'either', 'be', 'fair', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'story', 'was', 'intended', 'star', 'Marley', 'scenes', 'Marley', 'getting', 'things', 'chewing', 'furniture', 'pulling', 'owners', 'scenes', 'are', 'plenty', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'Marley', 'think', 'point', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'made', 'show', 'Marley', 'dysfunctional', 'important', 'member', 'family.We', 'first', 'see', 'Marley', 'puppy', 'time', 'family', 'arrival', 'three', 'children', 'ending', 'inevitable', 'Honestly', 'last', '20', 'so', 'minutes', 'were', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'Only', 'then', 'do', 'see', 'Marley', 'what', 'really', 'was', 'companion', 'family', 'member', 'hearts', 'when', 'Marley', 'distress', 'ultimate', 'decision', 'be', 'made', 'Many', 'have', 'been', 'there', ""n't"", 'fun', 'nice', 'scene', 'end', 'when', 'oldest', 'son', 'watches', 'old', 'home', 'videos', 'see', 'Marley', 'was', 'there', 'family', 'milestone', 'Marley', 'was', 'shot.The', 'last', 'part', 'movie', 'made', 'worth', 'watching', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Marley', 'antics', 'leading', 'up', 'ending', 'be', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dogs', 'pull', 'owners', 'get', 'things', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'Owen', 'Jennifer', 'reactions', 'are', ""n't"", 'particulary', 'hilarious', 'drama', 'really', ""n't"", 'dramatic.If', ""'re"", 'considering', 'buying', 'movie', 'wait', 'bit', 'sure', 'end', 'up', 'bargain', 'rather', 'quickly', 'watching', 'once', 'was', 'enough', 'plan', 'reading', 'book', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'book', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'book', 'up', 'what', 'movie', 'lacked']",N/A

Being completely unfamiliar with John Grogan's memoir, and knowing nothing about this movie other than its trailer that ran in the theaters, I was emotionally overwhelmed (in a good way) by this very moving film.  Anyone who has ever owned and loved a dog--and then had to say goodbye--will appreciate MARLEY & ME.Again, all I knew about this movie was what I gleaned from its trailer; namely, a young couple (Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, who are both wonderful in their roles as John and Jenny Grogan) with a feisty, uncontrollable yellow lab.  The trailer shows Marley chewing up and destroying things; it shows Wilson and Aniston chasing after a runaway Marley; it shows a wickedly disobedient Marley getting kicked out of obedience school by a flummoxed instructor (Kathleen Turner).  What we don't see are the very real and compelling components of a young couple battling career challenges and the duress of starting a family; what we don't see are the three Grogan children growing up in a loving household now featuring an aging Marley who more and more becomes the family focal point.  And what we don't see are the Grogans having to say goodbye to a 14-year-old senior dog; the closing scenes, particularly when John Grogan comforts Marley as he's being put down, were all very emotional and moving.  After being the family pet for several years a dog is very much a member of the family; seeing this movie brought the very real pain of saying goodbye back to the forefront.So I walked away from watching MARLEY & ME with a very genuine feeling of warmth and nostalgia.  Really good movies make you laugh and cry, and this one certainly did.  Please keep a carton of tissues close by.--D.

Unlike Marley, Frosty was a very obedient dog, but like Marley Frosty was also so very loyal & loving.People who are not into pets are often perplexed as to how a pet can be considered anything more than simply a pet.  The present DVD expatiates on how a canine can come to be considered a genuine part of a family, just as Marley was to his & Frosty was to mine.  If this film falls short of clarifying this particular point, then I'm afraid that the concept will never be understood by the viewer in question.For dog lovers, this film is a 5 Star treasure chest of nostalgia.

(Small price considering no dogs are allowed in my co-op).The first hour was about actor Owen Wilson buying a puppy so his wife, played by Jennifer Aniston, could take her mind off having a baby. The breeder offers them a discount on one dog, which they take. (Big mistake)! The puppy is an obvious terror, destroying garage storage, pillows, venetian blinds, even answering machines and curtain swatches. While they cannot afford a baby, they seem to do pretty well in replacing couch cushions and anything else made of cloth. (At this point I would have taken the mutt to Bide-a-Wee). The highlight is when Marley is taken to obedience school where he jumps the trainer, former real-life vixen and actress Kathleen Turner whom he takes for a French poodle, doing to her leg things humans can get arrested for in public. (Marley is thrown out of the training). Unfortunately, that is the high water mark (sorry) of the humor in this film except for the dog sitter who becomes rabidly distraught after caring for Marley for eleven days.The movie then focuses on the author's career in journalism and his family. We begin panting, wondering where the dog is, and then Debbie started barking at me because she thought it would never end. Shortly after, she rolled over on the love seat and played dead. (I got up to make sure she hadn't started chewing the upholstery). I was so bored I was ready to go outside and start eating grass.The dog returns as the main character in time for us to see him get old, and die after having a life of mayhem, and eating too many appliances and mangos. Naturally the kids have become attached to their dog and miss him as all kids do. Debbie began to cry. I began to howl with delight that this film had finally come to an end. It was 30 to 40 minutes too long, even in dog years. And then to discover that they had deleted scenes? They should have had even more of them!

My favorite scene in the movie is when Marley, as a puppy, is taken to the beach for the first time and takes off running.  The determined look on his face plus the wind blowing on his face made him look so cute and funny that I burst out laughing.And just like everyone else I know who's seen this movie, I cried towards the end, too.  I thought the message given by Owen Wilson's character was especially touching.However, despite the cute dog and heartwarming message, I thought this movie was just okay.  I thought the story lacked focus and wasn't as funny as it wanted to be.  For example, the scene where Marley attacks the dog trainer was supposed to be funny, but was predictable instead.

If you're looking for (human) character development, &#34;Marley and Me&#34; falls short of doing that. There are scenes in this movie that are hastily fast-forwarded (haste makes waste), so it's difficult to keep up with the story and figure out how the characters in this story develop and grow (e.g. the babies growing up to be kids in minutes and the dog, Marley, growing up to be a full-grown adult dog in about 30 minutes. Also, the fact that Owen Wilson's character gets a job and then gets a raise doesn't normally happen in reality (especially in this economy). I realize that has nothing to do with the central plot/story of this movie, but it needs to be mentioned to manifest the absence of reality in this movie. Going back to relevance and the review, this movie deserves 3 stars because Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson starred in this movie and because it tried its best to develop a worthwhile story (which is difficult, especially when the main character is a dog unable to speak or clearly show emotions).

I'm still wondering exactly which part of Marley's life should have endeared us to him as he spends 100% of the time destroying something. That his owners decided to ever let him inside the house is astounding. That they ever found a reason not to give him away must have been explained in the movie's deleted scenes. I guess if they had actually bought a good dog they would have formally adopted him into their family (at least). I still can't believe the makers of MARLEY & ME thought it was a good idea to show us Jennifer Aniston's dreaded ultrasound results in progress. One of this days they should also explain to us what was the point of showing Marley being being put to sleep in wide detail, I thought I was watching DEAD MAN WALKING (or in this case, DEAD DOG WALKING). I guess the best way to describe this movie is as a biography of Marley's owner and frankly a bio about the writer of a newspaper column about dogs is hardly earth-shattering.

John and Jenny decide to try taking Marley to obedience school, but that becomes a disaster in more ways than one, especially for the teacher.As the film goes on, John and Jen's life begins to change, as does Marley's.  Soon, children are added to the Grogan household, and Marley begins to age.  He still retains much of his playfulness, but the aging process is catching up with him.  John and his family decide to leave Florida when John is offered a new job, and they settle in Pennsylvania.  Marley, who has become older and slower since the move, begins to have severe health problems, including a turned stomach which only a skilled vet can fix.  John is cautioned that if Marley's stomach were to turn again, she probably wouldn't be able to fix it.  Sure enough, the inevitable stomach turn occurs again.  In one of the most touching and moving scenes I can ever remember from a movie, John tells Marley, who is now awaiting euthanasia, what a good and wonderful dog he has been.This is a very good movie.  Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson are excellent as the Grogan's, and it was a lot of fun watching Marley cause so much mischief.  The ending, however, was difficult for myself, my wife, and our three children to watch.  We have recently had a dog die from pancreatic cancer, so watching John and Marley was extremely difficult, especially for my wife and children.  All of us had tears running down our cheeks at the end.I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Dog lovers will surely enjoy watching the adventures and misadventures of ""the world's worst dog"".",5,"Good Movie, but a Tear-Jerker, too",1238976000,"04 6, 2009",2009,2136,"['Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'star', 'remarkably', 'yet', 'poignant', 'film', 'how', 'dog', 'can', 'change', 'person', 'life', 'forever', 'Owen', 'Jennifer', 'star', 'John', 'Jenny', 'Grogan', 'two', 'aspiring', 'newspaper', 'workers', 'who', 'live', 'south', 'Florida', 'marriage', 'John', 'Jenny', 'new', 'yellow', 'lab', 'puppy', 'bring', 'home', 'John', 'Jenny', 'soon', 'discover', 'lives', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'Marley', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'most', 'other', 'puppies', 'getting', 'mischief', 'chewing', 'everything', 'generally', 'making', 'nuisance', 'John', 'Jenny', 'decide', 'try', 'taking', 'Marley', 'obedience', 'school', 'disaster', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'especially', 'teacher.As', 'film', 'John', 'Jen', 'life', 'change', 'Marley', 'Soon', 'children', 'are', 'added', 'Grogan', 'household', 'Marley', 'age', 'still', 'much', 'playfulness', 'aging', 'process', 'catching', 'up', 'John', 'family', 'decide', 'leave', 'Florida', 'when', 'John', 'offered', 'new', 'job', 'settle', 'Pennsylvania', 'Marley', 'who', 'become', 'older', 'slower', 'move', 'have', 'severe', 'health', 'problems', 'including', 'turned', 'stomach', 'only', 'skilled', 'vet', 'can', 'fix', 'John', 'cautioned', 'Marley', 'stomach', 'were', 'turn', 'again', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'fix', 'Sure', 'enough', 'inevitable', 'stomach', 'turn', 'again', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'moving', 'scenes', 'can', 'ever', 'remember', 'movie', 'John', 'Marley', 'who', 'now', 'awaiting', 'euthanasia', 'what', 'good', 'wonderful', 'dog', 'been.This', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'are', 'excellent', 'Grogan', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching', 'Marley', 'cause', 'so', 'much', 'mischief', 'ending', 'however', 'was', 'difficult', 'wife', 'three', 'children', 'watch', 'have', 'recently', 'had', 'dog', 'die', 'pancreatic', 'cancer', 'so', 'watching', 'John', 'Marley', 'was', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'especially', 'wife', 'children', 'had', 'tears', 'running', 'down', 'cheeks', 'end.I', 'give', 'movie', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'Dog', 'lovers', 'will', 'surely', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'adventures', 'misadventures', 'world', 'worst', 'dog']",N/A

I liked the way it refused to let itself simply become a ""cute dog"" movie, maintaining its pedigree (couldn't resist) as a light drama/comedy that just happened to have a strong thread about a unique dog as a prime component.And unlike a few criticisms I've read, I didn't feel that the first three quarters of the film are slapstick fun and then we're unfairly waylaid by melancholy and sadness as issues of mortality are suddenly confronted.  Sure, there's a lot of goofiness early on as Marley tears up everything in sight, as well as delivers some unwanted romantic attention to Kathleen Turner's leg. But there's enough serious stuff throughout the earlier going, too, including an examination of the toll career and children can take on a marriage, that when the sad responsibilities of owning an old dog finally appear, there's no major tonal shift.  There's light material and dark material, silly moments and serious moments throughout the film.I watched the single-disc standard DVD version of ""Marley & Me"", which looks and sounds like gangbusters and has a few modest extra features (including a fun gag reel).  The movie is good enough, though, that I wouldn't mind seeing some of the more lavish extra features on the multi-disc edition.

The married man is out one day talking with his friend who tells him the next thing his wife will want is a kid.  They decide that getting a puppy will take her mind off it.  So the man gets a puppy.  Through the movie you get to see the couple learning to live and deal with a dog.  You also get to see them at their job.  There kind of competing with each other.  They are both writers.  Then you see them have kids.  You get to see how the mother takes leaving her job to watch her kids.  She has some problems.  It causes her a lot of stress.The movie spans over some years.  You see their kids get a little older.  While the main characters never really look any older, you see the dog aging.  They did a good job with the dog.  You really feel like your watching their life.  As I said, the movie is sad.  But I think it was for a reason.  The man sees his life as it was and realizes that now he can look at the way his life will be.  I hope I didn't give too much away.  It is a very good movie.

Stoneking,"[9, 14]","I decided to watch this movie because I am a dog lover, and grew up with all kinds of dogs, even a few ""bad dogs"" that might give Marley a run for his money.While the movie certainly hits its emotional chords just right towards the end of the movie, the final scenes in the movie lead me to see just how disappointing this movie ultimately was.All we see of Marley from pup to adult hood is a terror of a dog, a wild animal that refuses to be trained or tamed.  Chewing on anything and everything in sight and the complete lack of concern of his owners to do anything proactive about it just felt too comical, but not in the good way.  I felt like I was watching a BAD live action Marmaduke movie (as if there could be a good version of that!)However, in the end when John is having his heart felt talk to Marley, we hear of all the great things Marley did, such as stay by the side of John's sick son for hours on end and more.  Yet we see none of these things in the movie.As a dog lover, this is what disappointed me.  Sure, we all have had dogs that do ""bad"" things, but pups grow up and get past those things.  While it may have felt like a good idea to put only those bad moments in the movie, I feel sorely cheated out of a better movie because we didn't get to see the enduring moments that bonded Marley to his owners.  In turn, the movie fails to bond Marley to our hearts.  All we get to hear of those quieter enduring moments is in a few minutes of talking towards the end.I realize the movie focused mainly on the crazy things Marley did, the things that were the focus of a newspaper column, but that's all this movie ends up being then...just a long series of newspaper columns focusing on just the bad things the dog did.  In the end, we are told Marley was a great dog.  Sorry, Marley, I am sure you were, but the makers of this movie didn't communicate that enough.  And this wasn't a great movie because of that.Bottom line, don't get caught up in the emotional end of the movie...this movie has to stand up as a whole and a great, impactful ending does not make a great movie.",2,"Decent, but I expected better",1237939200,"03 25, 2009",2009,2096,"['decided', 'watch', 'movie', 'am', 'dog', 'lover', 'grew', 'up', 'kinds', 'dogs', 'even', 'few', 'bad', 'dogs', 'might', 'give', 'Marley', 'run', 'money.While', 'movie', 'certainly', 'emotional', 'chords', 'just', 'right', 'end', 'movie', 'final', 'scenes', 'movie', 'lead', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'disappointing', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'see', 'Marley', 'pup', 'adult', 'hood', 'terror', 'dog', 'wild', 'animal', 'be', 'trained', 'tamed', 'Chewing', 'anything', 'everything', 'sight', 'complete', 'lack', 'concern', 'owners', 'do', 'anything', 'proactive', 'just', 'felt', 'too', 'comical', 'not', 'good', 'way', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'BAD', 'live', 'action', 'Marmaduke', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'version', 'However', 'end', 'when', 'John', 'having', 'heart', 'felt', 'talk', 'Marley', 'hear', 'great', 'things', 'Marley', 'did', 'such', 'stay', 'side', 'John', 'sick', 'son', 'hours', 'end', 'more', 'see', 'none', 'things', 'movie.As', 'dog', 'lover', 'what', 'disappointed', 'Sure', 'have', 'had', 'dogs', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'pups', 'grow', 'up', 'get', 'past', 'things', 'may', 'have', 'felt', 'good', 'idea', 'put', 'only', 'bad', 'moments', 'movie', 'feel', 'sorely', 'cheated', 'better', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'enduring', 'moments', 'bonded', 'Marley', 'owners', 'turn', 'movie', 'bond', 'Marley', 'hearts', 'get', 'hear', 'quieter', 'enduring', 'moments', 'few', 'minutes', 'talking', 'end.I', 'realize', 'movie', 'focused', 'mainly', 'crazy', 'things', 'Marley', 'did', 'things', 'were', 'focus', 'newspaper', 'column', 'movie', 'up', 'being', 'then', 'just', 'long', 'series', 'newspaper', 'columns', 'focusing', 'just', 'bad', 'things', 'dog', 'did', 'end', 'are', 'told', 'Marley', 'was', 'great', 'dog', 'Sorry', 'Marley', 'am', 'sure', 'were', 'makers', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'communicate', 'enough', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'that.Bottom', 'line', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'emotional', 'end', 'movie', 'movie', 'stand', 'up', 'whole', 'great', 'impactful', 'ending', 'not', 'make', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

1233032,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B001REZM6K,Kathy W,"[3, 4]","Rated PG, a 2008 widescreen 2 disc release, this movie about a doggie and his family covered a 14 year period and starred Owen Wilson (John Grogan) and Jennifer Aniston (wife, Jenny Grogan).  Special performances included Alan Arkin as Sun Sentenial newspaper editor and Kathleen Turner as a dog obedience trainer. It was cute and entertaining.  It was not fantastic but it was good.  Most of the movie I would rate at a 3 or 4, but the last half hour or so was really good.  I recommend you have a box of Kleenex handy for the last 30 minutes.I expected the story to be more about Marley and although there was plenty about him, it really revolved around the life of a family that Marley was a part of.  It was not as funny as I expected it to be because it went into the struggles of a couple as their lives moved forward.  Nothing wrong with that, but just not what I had expected.A young married couple, both Journalists, move to Florida, and buy a puppy.  Marley turns out to be a wild man.  He even gets thrown out of obedience school.  The couple have children and go through things that young couples do, as they all grow together.There were 22 Yellow Labs used to make this movie, about half of them being puppies. Most of the pictures of full-grown wild Marley were of Clyde.  Jonah was the calm Marley. Rudy is the older Marley, who was actually about age 10 and was mostly unsociable.  Rudy is also the Marley who poops in the ocean.Disc 11) The movie2) 19 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary3) Finding Marley featurette-about the labs used in the movie4) Breaking the Golden Rule featurette5) On Set with Marley: Dog of All Trades featurette6) Animal Adoption featurette-explains how you can probably find any breed/mixture you want at a shelter.

The movie appears to have turned on many dog lovers who gave the movie high star reviews. However, it also turned off a good number of dog owners who feel that it is an owners responsibility to be the alpha and provide some discipline for their pets.  Marley was indeed a bad, willful but not mean spireted dog and needed some loving discipline.Although I agree with them I feel this was a good (but not great) film and enjoyed it for what it was worth.  For one thing the makers felt this film should not overemphasize Marley as a puppy. So we were not treated to many scenes of Marley as a young pup. If we had, the ending probably would have been much more effective.One scene of Owen Wilson house training the dog was very funny and showed him using his own lawn for an object lesson in not using the house as a bathroom.  The dog followed his lead and quickly did his thing. But Owen was spotted by a neighbor. I believe this scene was cut from the final film.By the way, I only paid $7 for the double disk set recently at COSTCO and it was worth every bit of this very modest price.",3,Marley And Me (Two-Disc Bad Dog Edition) (2009)-2 disk edition was a good deal!,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,1184,"['Marley', 'Me', 'Two-Disc', 'Bad', 'Dog', 'Edition', '2009', 'was', 'nice', 'package', 'what', 'purchased', 'movie', 'have', 'turned', 'many', 'dog', 'lovers', 'who', 'gave', 'movie', 'high', 'star', 'reviews', 'However', 'also', 'turned', 'off', 'good', 'number', 'dog', 'owners', 'who', 'feel', 'owners', 'responsibility', 'be', 'alpha', 'provide', 'discipline', 'pets', 'Marley', 'was', 'indeed', 'bad', 'willful', 'not', 'mean', 'spireted', 'dog', 'needed', 'loving', 'discipline.Although', 'agree', 'feel', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'was', 'worth', 'one', 'thing', 'makers', 'felt', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'overemphasize', 'Marley', 'puppy', 'were', 'not', 'treated', 'many', 'scenes', 'Marley', 'young', 'pup', 'had', 'ending', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'effective.One', 'scene', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'house', 'training', 'dog', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'showed', 'using', 'own', 'lawn', 'object', 'lesson', 'not', 'using', 'house', 'bathroom', 'dog', 'followed', 'lead', 'quickly', 'did', 'thing', 'Owen', 'was', 'spotted', 'neighbor', 'believe', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 'final', 'film.By', 'way', 'only', 'paid', '7', 'double', 'disk', 'set', 'recently', 'COSTCO', 'was', 'worth', 'bit', 'very', 'modest', 'price']",N/A

A) I can not handle pets in jeopardy scenes. I won't watch Old Yeller, I cried over the promo clip for 8 Below. My mom always thought Lassie was my favorite show, but I always watched with my little heart in my throat and sweat glistening my brow. B) I'm sentimental and a sucker for anything that is designed to play my heartstrings. I've cried at Hallmark and coffee commercials along with a thousand movies. It's so bad that my family watches me for entertainment during sad scenes.Marley and Me were never meant to be. But on Monday, a friend invited a few of us over for her birthday. Her movie of choice? Yeah. You guessed it.I sobbed. Not even going to try to downplay the sad. My eyes were swollen for at least an hour after the movie ended. I didn't just cry at the end, I was leaking from the mid-point. I'm not even a natural dog person. That said, I like Marley and Me. I liked it because it didn't rely on just cheap ""cute"" pet shots to win over the viewers, instead it was a nicely fleshed out character piece. The Grogans struggled with life in quite a few scenes and I was there with them. I didn't grow as attached to Marley as I might have, and this is a good thing, any more attached and it would have been too, too sad, because the filming covered about a dozen years in highlights.Some of the scenes were hysterical. Some also hit a little close to home. Alan Arkin cracks me up. I love his delivery. Only one caution...I watched this film with an eleven year-old and cringed a few times. The language is mild, but there is some. The situations are PG-to PG-13, but there are a few uncomfortable moments, especially with a child in the room.

I think most of the funny parts were on the previews. After about the first hour the movie started getting kinda dull and boring. The focus stopped being about Marley and started being about Jen's and Owen's character's marriage and family problems. Marley just kind of faded into the background which I thought was unfair.

It is a really heart-warming story about lives, love and a loyal -- if rambunctious dog.  Really good performances by Owen Wilson, Jennifer Aniston (who never looked more beautiful) and Alan Arkin.  I can relate to John Grogan's story -- I think must of us can -- I had a dog (infact the last one) and we got her when she was a pup and she had an exuburance of personality.  My Dad got her as a house dog for my Mom.  After she died it became my younger sister's dog and -- after she bite her husband -- she became mine and my ex-wife.  My wife used to say she didn't know which one of us (me or the dog) snored louder! I still remember one time when I had the flu and she jumped up on the bed, stuck her cold muzzle in my face, licked me and then curled up next to me. She was with me for fourteen years and time took its toll.  She got old, then she went blind.  I knew what was the right thing to do but I just couldn't bring myself to kill my friend.

Film pooches always seem to be made more brave, loyal, smart, courageous, etc than any dog could be in real life, and don't even get me started on films where dogs talk, play basketball or practice law.Marley & Me gets several things correct, and one of them is that Marley is always a dog, and never imbued with super-canine capabilities. In fact, not only is Marley not Lassie, he is, in fact, 100 pounds of canine catastrophe - pooping in inopportune places and sometimes eating things like sofa cushions.Marley serves as a life-marker for John and Jennifer Grogan, played by Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston as an almost-too-good-to-be-true married couple. We learn that they both begin their careers as cub journalists, but where Jennifer has many offers and signs on with the most prestigious paper in town, John considers himself lucky to get any position, and he's initially assigned methane leaks and community counsel meetings.Jen is ready for children and John is not initially. A friend suggests a puppy to keep her mind off the desire for pregnancy. Enter Marley, a cute Labrador pup sold at a marked down price compared to his brothers and sisters. Jen calls him ""clearance puppy"". Marley gives them reason to second-guess themselves for getting a dog as he chews everything in the house, howls when left alone, and humps the leg of the obedience class instructor (played in a brief slapstick turn by Kathleen Turner).The next dozen-plus years of the Grogans are woven into a series of anecdotes related to the three children who come (including the youngest daughter who is born with a nickname we hear in one of the funniest lines of the film.) John wants to be a reporter, but for the good of the family takes a large promotion to write a column twice a week. When his muse fails he writes slice of life vignettes that include life with ""the worst dog in the world."" For the good of the family Jen takes a child-rearing hiatus, and some of the most realistic scenes of the film show the family frustrations as Jen gives up her prestigious writing job to raise their children and clean up after Marley's disasters.In the ominous prelude to the inspirational story of Brian Piccolo, ""Brian's Song"" we are warned that all true stories end in death. Knowing that dogs are quite old at the age humans reach puberty, I was expecting this movie to be a ""true story"" also. I've seen some reviews warning that children should not be allowed to see the film because of the inevitable sadness that comes in the end. I would argue that it is a valuable lesson for the emotionally developing child to learn about loss, and it's an easier lesson with a film pooch than with a loved-one familiar to the child.Marley & Me is a slice of life movie, with several life-interludes spliced together rather than a true narrative arc, but your interest is maintained because you enjoy the company of these characters and you care what happens to them and their dog. When Marley is old and sick the family gathers to comfort the dog and themselves. The youngest girl offers Marley her stuffed lamb. ""Here, you can chew the OTHER ear off...""

1233057,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B001REZM6K,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[5, 6]","Marley & Me is a movie about love and acceptance with lots of action, fun and the realities of life. The movie held my attention although I think they could have cut a few minutes off to tighten it up here and there. Nevertheless, the acting was very convincing throughout the movie. The cinematography works well for the crowded beach scenes in Florida as well as in the Grogan household when Marley the dog is running around like anything; and the choreography shines bright.When the action starts, we meet newlyweds John and Jennifer Grogan (Clive Owen and Jennifer Aniston) who marry during a rare springtime blizzard in Michigan. They are young and very much in love; but they decide to live in a warmer climate so they move to Florida. Once in Florida, Jennifer wants a baby; they also go to a woman who has puppies for sale--lots of them--and they pick the discount puppy that John names Marley.And Marley sure is a handful--fatherhood is less stressful! We get many funny situations in which Marley chews up anything and everything, especially when he is restless. Marley simply can't be controlled; he even flunks obedience training school on the very first day! On another occasion, Marley swallows an expensive necklace John gives to Jennifer when she's pregnant with their first child.Of course, we get drama that's much more human, too--and we see Marley becoming more and more of an equal family member going along with the family as they make decisions about their lives. Will John and Jennifer have more children; and will they always remain in Florida? In addition, look for a fine performance by Eric Dane playing Sebastian, a womanizer who befriends John after John starts working at a Florida newspaper called The Sun-Sentinel.I must admit that although many of these amusing ""dog-run-amuck"" scenes might not be so funny if they happened to you in real life. For example, if you had a dog that completely destroyed your garage tumbling over your stored possessions, breaking some of them and even eating through drywall, your day might be so pleasant. In the movie, however, it works for a good laugh.Moreover, the ending of the film is upsetting, especially for young children. I suggest that grown-ups talk to their children before seeing this movie so that they don't experience too much of a shock.The single DVD version of this movie comes with a gag reel; and we get some deleted scenes, too.Overall, Marley & Me gives us a tender portrait of a family that includes a dog as a true-blue member of the family regardless of how difficult the dog can be. The movie sends a great message about the importance of unconditional love; and I recommend this movie on DVD despite an ending that isn't exactly the happiest.",5,a well-crafted movie about love and the realities of life,1238457600,"03 31, 2009",2009,2738,"['Marley', 'Me', 'movie', 'love', 'acceptance', 'lots', 'action', 'fun', 'realities', 'life', 'movie', 'held', 'attention', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'cut', 'few', 'minutes', 'tighten', 'up', 'here', 'there', 'Nevertheless', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'convincing', 'movie', 'cinematography', 'well', 'crowded', 'beach', 'scenes', 'Florida', 'as', 'well', 'Grogan', 'household', 'when', 'Marley', 'dog', 'running', 'around', 'anything', 'choreography', 'shines', 'bright.When', 'action', 'meet', 'newlyweds', 'John', 'Jennifer', 'Grogan', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'who', 'marry', 'rare', 'springtime', 'blizzard', 'Michigan', 'are', 'young', 'very', 'much', 'love', 'decide', 'live', 'warmer', 'climate', 'move', 'Florida', 'Once', 'Florida', 'Jennifer', 'baby', 'also', 'go', 'woman', 'who', 'puppies', 'sale', 'lots', 'pick', 'discount', 'puppy', 'John', 'names', 'Marley.And', 'Marley', 'sure', 'handful', 'fatherhood', 'less', 'stressful', 'get', 'many', 'funny', 'situations', 'Marley', 'up', 'anything', 'everything', 'especially', 'when', 'restless', 'Marley', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'controlled', 'even', 'obedience', 'training', 'school', 'very', 'first', 'day', 'occasion', 'Marley', 'expensive', 'necklace', 'John', 'Jennifer', 'when', 'pregnant', 'first', 'child.Of', 'course', 'get', 'drama', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'too', 'see', 'Marley', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'equal', 'family', 'member', 'going', 'along', 'family', 'make', 'decisions', 'lives', 'Will', 'John', 'Jennifer', 'have', 'more', 'children', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'Florida', 'addition', 'look', 'fine', 'performance', 'Eric', 'Dane', 'playing', 'Sebastian', 'womanizer', 'who', 'John', 'John', 'working', 'Florida', 'newspaper', 'called', 'Sun-Sentinel.I', 'must', 'admit', 'many', 'amusing', 'dog-run-amuck', 'scenes', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'funny', 'happened', 'real', 'life', 'example', 'had', 'dog', 'completely', 'destroyed', 'garage', 'tumbling', 'stored', 'possessions', 'breaking', 'even', 'eating', 'drywall', 'day', 'might', 'be', 'so', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'however', 'good', 'laugh.Moreover', 'ending', 'film', 'upsetting', 'especially', 'young', 'children', 'suggest', 'grown-ups', 'talk', 'children', 'seeing', 'movie', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'experience', 'too', 'much', 'shock.The', 'single', 'DVD', 'version', 'movie', 'gag', 'reel', 'get', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'too.Overall', 'Marley', 'Me', 'tender', 'portrait', 'family', 'dog', 'true-blue', 'member', 'family', 'regardless', 'how', 'difficult', 'dog', 'can', 'be', 'movie', 'great', 'message', 'importance', 'unconditional', 'love', 'recommend', 'movie', 'DVD', 'ending', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'happiest']",N/A

It was very well done and both Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston were excellent in these roles. I even think Mr. Wilson looks like John Grogan a little bit. A wonderful family film, but if you have ever gone through the loss of a beloved pet, be sure to bring a box of Kleenex for the last 30 minutes. The ending was extremely well done and realistic. It particularily struck me how in those last few moments that the character John Grogan spends with Marley, he touches his tail, feels his paws, and buries his face in the dog's soft fur, because that is exactly what I did with my old lab before I said good-bye to her. It was incredibly true to life and very, very moving. Picture quality was exceptional with the scenes in rural Pennsylvania (my home too!) in the Fall and Winter near the end of the film beautiful to look at and sound quality, well, my dogs both turned their heads and looked at the TV when Marley is locked in the garage for his first night and is whimpering and crying, so it must be pretty good. I really like this film and am very happy to have added it to my Blu Ray collection.

Otherwise I'd give it a 3.After renting and viewing this movie with kids, my husband and I were shocked this was rated only PG! There is constant talk of sex, considerable swearing (b-word, s**t, etc), bikini babes, a womanizer, a dog humping a lady, the two main characters get naked and jump in the pool (some very brief breast shown). It even goes so far as they get it on in a room full of religious statues, paintings, and crucifixes on the wall. That's just wrong and I'm not even religious! They could've left those details out of a PG movie! It's just NOT for younger kids, as in under 13. After the number of times it was mentioned in this movie, I'm surprised my 8-year-old hasn't asked what ""sex"" is yet.  As parents we would say treat this as PG-13. Had we known it had so much of this in it, we would not have permitted our kids to see it! Disney movies are rated PG, and I'm talkin' cartoons. This is no where near as mild ...As for the movie itself, it was okay. The acting was good. There were some very funny scenes (one of which was the humping dog and the kids turned and asked what he was doing). Not as good as the book, and it doesn't follow the book completely. For instance in the movie John gets the dog because he doesn't want his wife asking for kids. In the book he gets the dog cause she wants to make sure she can nurture something and keep it alive before trying for kids (she killed all the houseplants). Making him against kids is not true to his character portrayed in the book!I'm glad I got the rental for free, looking back I probably would've regretted paying new-release price to see it. Decent movie for a couple or a family with older children. If you want a good PG movie for younger kids, where they don't discuss sex every 5 or 10 minutes, swim naked and have their honeymoon in a room full of crucifixes, I recommend ""Underdog.""",2,Parents Beware!

He did not just chew it either; he ate it and digested it, then he came back and ate the phone for dessert ."" ~John Grogan ~ (Marley & Me).Brief summary:Marley & Me is a comedy about a Yellow Labrador Retriever. A young couple John and Jenny Grogan adopts Marley as a puppy and soon discover why he was sold to them on clearance. He is the ""worst dog in the world"" and wreaks havoc and destruction everywhere he goes. John gets an idea from his friend Sebastian that a dog might help him avoid some tough responsibility and allow him a few years of freedom by getting his wife's mind off of having a baby. The plan doesn't work out as well as John hopes and finds out that owning a Labrador Retriever can be just as tough as raising children.My experience:I had avoided Marley & Me since its release to theaters. I had heard rumors that the movie was so sad that grown men would leave the theater to avoid the embarrassment of bawling like a baby in front of thier family, friends and worse yet, complete strangers.The movie traces the life of a Yellow Labrador named Marley and follows thru to the dogs last days of life. Since I had just suffered the loss of losing my first Labrador; Zira in 2005 I knew I would not be able to cope well with the story-line. As the old saying goes ""Time heals all"" and I felt I was finally ready to take on the challenge of watching this most talked about film by all Labrador Retriever fans and just dog lovers in general.The movie made me laugh out-loud so many times and I could relate and appreciate every aspect of John and Jenny's experience with Marley. John is also a writer so I could definitely relate to that as well. Most of the humorous lines come from the character John and of course from the hilarious antics and behaviors from Marley.There were so many heartfelt moments, they were so tear jerkingly touching, that some lumps in my throat had to be swallowed back and then the writers of the movie could immediately make me laugh again. The last half hour of the movie was so sad that I must admit I was glad I watched this movie alone. It did indeed have me ""bawling like a baby"" (I guess I am such a softie when it comes to stuff like this.) However I thought the movie ended on such a positive note that I found myself really enjoying this film. My biggest disappointment was that Marley is only an adorable little puppy for about ten minutes in the entire movie. I would have liked to have seen more of that.The movie overall:The acting was very well followed thru and Owen Wilson as John Grogan was very funny and an extremely likeable character. Jennifer Aniston as Jenny was just okay to me. The pacing of the movie was a little bit on the slow side, with all the family, pregnancy and baby stuff; the pay-off at the end however made it necessary so it was well worth it.The acting (if you can call it that) from Marley was fantastic, he really makes this movie extremely enjoyable and I will treasure Marley & Me for a long time.The music in Marley & Me was very decent as well; from the opening title theme to a remake of a Nirvana song all the way to the heart wrenching ending theme, I will simply name it, ""Reflections"".There were a few adult themed elements that gave the movie its deserving PG Rating but all in all I found it to be very appropriate for young children. I would highly recommend Marley & Me to any dog lovers and to all Labrador Retriever fans.",4,Marley & Me makes a grown man cry.,1308787200,"06 23, 2011",2011,3516,"['Marley', 'not', 'just', 'regular', 'dog', 'once', 'ate', 'answering', 'machine', 'polished', 'off', 'did', 'not', 'just', 'chew', 'either', 'ate', 'digested', 'then', 'came', 'back', 'ate', 'phone', 'dessert', 'Grogan', '~', 'Marley', 'Me', '.Brief', 'summary', 'Marley', 'Me', 'comedy', 'Yellow', 'Labrador', 'Retriever', 'A', 'young', 'couple', 'John', 'Jenny', 'Grogan', 'Marley', 'puppy', 'soon', 'discover', 'why', 'was', 'sold', 'clearance', 'worst', 'dog', 'world', 'wreaks', 'havoc', 'destruction', 'everywhere', 'John', 'idea', 'friend', 'dog', 'might', 'help', 'avoid', 'tough', 'responsibility', 'allow', 'few', 'years', 'freedom', 'getting', 'wife', 'mind', 'having', 'baby', 'plan', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'John', 'out', 'owning', 'Labrador', 'Retriever', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'tough', 'raising', 'children.My', 'experience', 'had', 'avoided', 'Marley', 'Me', 'release', 'theaters', 'had', 'heard', 'rumors', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'sad', 'grown', 'men', 'would', 'leave', 'theater', 'avoid', 'embarrassment', 'bawling', 'baby', 'front', 'thier', 'family', 'friends', 'worse', 'yet', 'complete', 'strangers.The', 'movie', 'life', 'Yellow', 'Labrador', 'named', 'Marley', 'thru', 'dogs', 'last', 'days', 'life', 'had', 'just', 'suffered', 'loss', 'losing', 'first', 'Labrador', 'Zira', '2005', 'knew', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'cope', 'well', 'story-line', 'old', 'saying', 'Time', 'heals', 'felt', 'was', 'finally', 'ready', 'take', 'challenge', 'watching', 'most', 'talked', 'film', 'Labrador', 'Retriever', 'fans', 'just', 'dog', 'lovers', 'general.The', 'movie', 'made', 'out-loud', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'could', 'relate', 'appreciate', 'aspect', 'John', 'Jenny', 'experience', 'Marley', 'John', 'also', 'writer', 'could', 'definitely', 'relate', 'as', 'well', 'Most', 'humorous', 'lines', 'come', 'character', 'John', 'course', 'hilarious', 'antics', 'behaviors', 'Marley.There', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'heartfelt', 'moments', 'were', 'so', 'tear', 'jerkingly', 'touching', 'lumps', 'throat', 'had', 'be', 'swallowed', 'back', 'then', 'writers', 'movie', 'could', 'immediately', 'make', 'laugh', 'again', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'sad', 'must', 'admit', 'was', 'glad', 'watched', 'movie', 'alone', 'did', 'indeed', 'have', 'bawling', 'baby', 'guess', 'am', 'softie', 'when', 'stuff', 'However', 'thought', 'movie', 'ended', 'such', 'positive', 'note', 'found', 'really', 'enjoying', 'film', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'was', 'Marley', 'only', 'adorable', 'little', 'puppy', 'about', 'ten', 'minutes', 'entire', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'that.The', 'movie', 'overall', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'followed', 'thru', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'John', 'Grogan', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'extremely', 'likeable', 'character', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Jenny', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'pacing', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'slow', 'side', 'family', 'pregnancy', 'baby', 'stuff', 'pay-off', 'end', 'however', 'made', 'necessary', 'was', 'well', 'worth', 'it.The', 'acting', 'can', 'call', 'Marley', 'was', 'fantastic', 'really', 'movie', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'will', 'treasure', 'Marley', 'Me', 'long', 'time.The', 'music', 'Marley', 'Me', 'was', 'very', 'decent', 'well', 'opening', 'title', 'theme', 'remake', 'Nirvana', 'song', 'way', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'ending', 'theme', 'will', 'simply', 'name', 'Reflections', 'were', 'few', 'adult', 'themed', 'elements', 'gave', 'movie', 'deserving', 'PG', 'Rating', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'appropriate', 'young', 'children', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Marley', 'Me', 'dog', 'lovers', 'Labrador', 'Retriever', 'fans']",N/A

I can't think of any others right now, so on we go.

Then, as Marley grows up, hijinks ensue as the family grows and changes, all the while they all continue to bond with their furry companion.  Much like the book it's based on, this film should tug at the heartstrings from beginning to end.  Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston actually do make a convincing couple.

I'm a dog lover and I love all animals, but this movie just didn't do it for me. Let me start by saying that I didn't read the book. So I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. I thought the movie was kind of shallow and that I didn't really get to know the characters. There were some great scenes, but I just didn't feel close to them. Part of it may have been the acting, but mostly I think it was just the writing. So much of it just seemed kind of a cliche.I thought the ending was way overdone and unnecessary.

We had a Samoyed that died two years ago and that's still sad for me, because she was like my little sister. Owen Wilson and sexy Jennifer Aniston did an awesome job. They adopt Marley and have to deal with his crazy misadventures. When Marley gets older, he doesn't seem like the main star. I loved all the trouble Marley got into. I was pretty much hyperventilating when it came to Marley's goodbye. It was extremely harsh to show his on-screen death, because that was not fair to dog lovers. They did take it too far for me.

To reverse the usual way a tornado is used as metaphor - Marley is the swirling storm that comes to define the quiet center of the movie. That center is the Grogans' relationship.It's rare to find a movie couple that, for the most part, continues to respect each other and to take delight in each other through all the tumult of having children, maintaining a home, moving, struggling towards career goals - and a dog like Marley. But then maybe Marley really did bind them better by giving them some definable difficulty to exercise themselves on. Better to worry over the concrete vandalisms of a Marley than to dwell on all the vague resentments that can accumulate in a marriage.So we see Marley giving people some focus of trouble, something to invest themselves in -  and therefore something to love. That essential love is what this movie is really about. In the end, this is a family film in that it's about a family growing up, loving, and growing older - together.However, I do think it would be better to get the two-disc set with all the extras. I only got the bare-bones single disc. But I really would have liked to see more about the various dogs who played Marley, the training techniques, the interviews, and all the behind-the-scenes tidbits.Then if you want to meet another animal who invited love by being a constant handful, you might read Sy Montgomery's bestseller, ""The Good, Good Pig.""",4,Weathering the Storm,1239321600,"04 10, 2009",2009,1495,"['review', 'single-disc', 'DVDMarley', 'really', 'not', 'center', 'film', 'reverse', 'usual', 'way', 'tornado', 'used', 'metaphor', 'Marley', 'swirling', 'storm', 'define', 'quiet', 'center', 'movie', 'center', 'Grogans', 'relationship.It', 'rare', 'find', 'movie', 'couple', 'most', 'part', 'respect', 'other', 'take', 'delight', 'other', 'tumult', 'having', 'children', 'maintaining', 'home', 'moving', 'struggling', 'towards', 'career', 'goals', 'dog', 'Marley', 'then', 'maybe', 'Marley', 'really', 'did', 'bind', 'better', 'giving', 'definable', 'difficulty', 'exercise', 'Better', 'worry', 'concrete', 'vandalisms', 'Marley', 'dwell', 'vague', 'resentments', 'can', 'accumulate', 'marriage.So', 'see', 'Marley', 'giving', 'people', 'focus', 'trouble', 'something', 'invest', 'therefore', 'something', 'love', 'essential', 'love', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'end', 'family', 'film', 'family', 'growing', 'up', 'loving', 'growing', 'older', 'together.However', 'do', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'get', 'two-disc', 'set', 'extras', 'only', 'got', 'bare-bones', 'single', 'disc', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'various', 'dogs', 'who', 'played', 'Marley', 'training', 'techniques', 'interviews', 'behind-the-scenes', 'tidbits.Then', 'want', 'meet', 'animal', 'who', 'invited', 'love', 'being', 'constant', 'handful', 'might', 'read', 'Sy', 'Montgomery', 'bestseller', 'Good', 'Good', 'Pig']",N/A

I own over 2,000 DVDs in my collection and I've watched thousands more that I got rid off, traded or sold so I've seen my share of movies - both moving, outstanding, average and lousy.I want to tell you how disappointing it was for me to watch this mislabeled supposedly comedy with my wife. I laughed maybe a couple of times. The other times we were shocked with how depressing this movie was to sit through. For one Owen Wilson in real life attempted suicide before he got this movie role. That gives you an idea where this movie was headed. This labrador was cute at the beginning of the movie as a puppy and then out of control the rest of the way. I wanted to call Cesar Milan ""The Dog Whisper"" to get this lab under control and maybe a marriage counselor for Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson, both acting irresponsible most of the time,, having no clue how to handle Marley. It was not a fun movie to watch. You hear both of them arguing and fighting about his out of control dog for most of the movie. It was about real life, drama more than a comedy. I wanted to get rid of the DVD even before it was over. This movie is a good one to watch to deter you from getting married and/or getting a labrador. Other dog and animal movies after watching them you want to go out and get a pet like just them.The cover of the DVD is also misleading, Marley looks like that for only a couple of minutes at the beginning as a puppy. He is already bigger when Owen takes the lab home.The only redeeming value for this movie is the last 20 minutes or so when you know that Marley is doing to die. My wife and I are serious pet lovers, we have one dog and six cats, they are our babies. We had to put our beloved cat Pete down last Sept. and it crushed us to do that. To put him to sleep was not anywhere as peaceful as the movie showed. Pee who was a such a loving Siamese cross breed, jerked violently, threw up and pooped when the final injection was given. Pete was such a loving cat and it watch him die like that was such a shocking experience, one that pet owners should never have to endure.But saying goodbye to Marley brought tears to my eyes as I heard the last goodbyes. It's hard to say goodbye to a family member and friend.The two ""stars"" for my review are mainly for the last minutes of the movie.

He humps everything in sight (especially poodles), fails obedience class, weighs 100 lbs and pulls them everywhere on the leash, eats mangos, chews up everything in sight, and is generally a bad, disobedient dog.Grogan's family finally expands with the birth of their first child, Patrick, and Marley continues to be an important part of their life.  There's fun, frolicking, and frisky adventure whenever Marley is involved.'Marley & Me' is the life story of Marley, so get ready for some tears along with the laughs.  It's a surprisingly pleasant story of a family growing and developing, along with a dog that never listens and is afraid of thunderstorms.  The movie is saved from being too sweet by showing the tragedies of life too, such as Jenny miscarrying her first baby, and their second son suffering with colic.  Great performance by Kathleen Turner as the dog trainer, and Alan Arkin as Grogan's boss Arnie Klein.The screenwriter and director did an excellent job of capturing Grogan's tale of Life, starting with early marriage and two people in love with good careers and a happy life, through the birth and raising of their children and the difficulties faced by everyday life in aging and raising children and balancing homelife with careers, and eventually turning forty.  Don't miss out on the book either, John Grogan is an excellent writer.Like I said, the movie really surprised me at how good it is - a solid 5 stars!  Don't miss out on this fun, well acted, well directed, and well written story.

Cue Marley, a cute, but rambunctious and lively Labrador puppy who soon has them running around after him and pulling their house and life to bits.There are lots of funny scenes where Marley gets one over on the couple and his antics do make for entertaining viewing, although at times I wish they would just discipline him and stop the disruption he brings! He is certainly a well natured, but head strong dog.Eventually the couple start a family, with the associated stresses that brings, but the one constant is Marley and he is soon seen as an integral part of the family unit. The film then follows the family's ups and downs for the duration of Marley's life, with the inevitable and heart warming ending.Aniston was very good in this film and Wilson also showed more depth than in previous films I have seen him in. It has to be said that this is certainly a film for dog lovers and as I hinted at before, I became frustrated at some points throughout at the misbehaved antics of Marley and I wished he would be brought in line, despite a rather feeble half hearted attempt to do just that. But these frustrations were short lived and I was soon enjoying the next stage in his and the family's life.This is easy going and not too stressful to watch. It has a nice message and has some genuinely funny moments.

And if you really do have a heart, you will find yourself doing the same thing. So if you are going to watch this movie, I would suggust you have tissues opr kleenex on hand. Marley and Me tells the by a story of a young newy wed couple, and is based of a book, that I was prety much barely aware of. The book was written by John Grogan. The big question I have with the movie, is what is the timeline of the movie,  know from watching the movie, that John and his wife Jenny Grogan, owned Marley for 13 years. And Marley is not a very good boy, and even at one point, he scares a house sitter, that annouces to the Grograns, that Marley is not a Dog, more lie evil with a dog face. And if you have, or see the movie you will know what I mean. The movie opens on thier wedding night, wear Joh and Jenny have a talk, which learns hem to move from Michigan to Florida, they get jobs at rival newspapers, Jenny (Jennifer Aniston)  is hired at The Palm Beach Post, and John (Owen Wilson) gets a job at South Florida Sun-Sentinel, where he writes obituaries and two-paragraph articles about mundane news like a fire at the local garbage dump. His best friend Sebastian (Eric Dane) ""also works there, and more or less helps him get the job. His editor is Arnie Klein(Alan Arkin). Then Jenny really gets a jump on her plans, which includes having a baby. And Sebastian sugguests to John, to get a dog to see see if they are ready to start a family. So on surpise trip, John takes Jenny to b uy a dog. The dog they select, they get, for less, then the other puppies. Jenny says he is seet like a ""clearhouse puppy"". Then she has to out of town for a couple of weeks, leavin John to take care of he dog. And on he car ride home, John hears ""One Love"" by Bob Marley, on the radio, which inspires him to call him Marley. Then Arnie offers John, his own column, and even on a tempory basis, which John has no intrest in doing, but does agree. Through during the years they have Marley, they don't age, they do have kids, and even has to face what all dog owners pretty much have to face.

Based on the memoir by newspaper columnist John Grogan, the film is the chronicle of a young family and their dog, Marley, easily the worst dog in the world.  He destroys furniture, eats through walls, jumps out of car windows, and is entirely out of control.  Yet to Grogan, played by Owen Wilson, and Jenny (Jennifer Aniston), Marley is part of the family, even as their three children come along.The movie follows Marley from puppyhood onward, and there are some very sad moments as Marley faces problems brought on by old age.  Yet most of the film is upbeat and very funny.  You'll find yourself simultaneously shaking your head at the chaos created by the four-leggged star and smiling at his simple joy of life.  The three-disc release contains Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copies of the movie with loads of bonus extras.

1233123,A4JHEO7H330AF,B001REZM6K,Tom Brody,"[1, 1]","MARLEY AND ME is a color film starring Owen Wilson, Jennifer Aniston, and a white dog.  The story begins at the time Mr.Wilson and Ms.Aniston are about 30 years old, and newlyweds.  They live in Michigan, but within the opening minutes of the film, move to Florida.  Mr.Wilson goes on a job interview for a large metropolitan newspaper, and gets the job.  While his career goal was to be a newspaper reporter, he eventually segues into a higher paying job at the same newspaper as a columnist.  In general, the job of a newspaper columnist is to immerse oneself into the story, and to become part of the story.  Mr.Wilson is highly successful at this job.  At the start of this job, he drives a Toyota Tercel (the tiniest of automobiles) and when he achieves the position of a ""regional celebrity"" (to use a phrase used in the film), Mr.Wilson owns a minivan and a house with a gorgeous swimming pool.With the move to Florida, Ms.Aniston, also acquires a job with a newspaper, but for another paper in the same city.  With Mr.Wilson's success, the couple eventually have three babies.  The film is basically a ""slice of life"" movie that lacks any particular plot, lacks any excitement, and is substantially lacking in humor.  Ms.Aniston loses her first child, when it is in the ten week embryo stage.  To relax and recouperate from this loss, the couple takes a vacation to Ireland, where they stay in a homey cottage, where the room is festooned with the accoutrements of the Catholic church.  The room contains a painting of The Pope, a painting of Jesus, a painting of Mary, and a large crucifix.  Mr.Wilson and Ms.Aniston feel a little nervous because their attempt at finding a romantic getaway resulted, instead, in a cottage decorated with so many authorities of the Catholic church.  At any rate, in one of the rare moments in the movie where something interesting actually happened, the couple decide to procreate (despite the stern gazes from The Pope, Jesus, and Mary), and the result is a healthy child.Eventually, Mr.Wilson's original goal of becoming a newspaper reporter gnaws at him and, to make a long story short, he accepts a position with a major Philadelphia newspaper, and becomes a reporter.  Mr.Wilson's supervisor sternly tells him that he places himself in the stories, that he should not be doing this,and that his own personna should be excluded from his reporting.  Witnessing this particular moment is, perhaps, worth the time and effort of enduring the slice-of-life plotlessness that plagues the entire picture.Okay, the movie is called, MARLEY AND ME.  What is grafted on the career-story of Mr.Wilson, and the story of Ms.Aniston's newspaper career that becomes transformed into a homemaker's career, is continual slapstick provided by the dog, ""Marley.""  Near the start of the movie, Mr.Wilson provides Ms.Aniston with a freshly weaned puppy as a birthday present.  The puppy is a hungry one, grows quickly, and has the protean appetite of a goat.  Marley has a particular affinity for couches, pillows, plaster walls, and he proceeds to rip up these things with his teeth.  Marley even eats a gold necklace.  Also, Marley eats great quantities of actual dog food, and acts up during the many thunderstorms found in Florida.  Marley is truly an unruly dog.Overall, about 50% of the time in the movie is spent with slapstick, that is, showing Marley breaking things and running amok.  (The slapstick is NOT particularly funny or amusing.  It is just ruckus for the sake of ruckus.  The continual scenes showing the dog breaking things and tearing up furniture is as funny as scenes from THE THREE STOOGES, where Curly gets a screw driver thrust into his eye.  ""Ha, ha, ha, oh how funny!"") About 25% of the time is spent showing Mr.Wilson and Ms.Aniston in ordinary domestic situations, for example, by having a petty argument, or spending time with their kids.  And about 25% of the movie is spent disclosing the development of Mr.Wilson's career.  I am not sure how history will judge this weird movie.  The movie is more like one of the ""reality"" shows that sometimes find their way to television, that is, where cameramen film ordinary events taking place in a person's life over the course of a month.  The film mainly shows ordinary things that happen, during the course of an ordinary middle-class couple.  The film drags on almost interminably in his way, showing ordinary ""slice-of-life"" things, over and over and again and again.  Aside from the episode in the Irish cottage, this movie is TOTALLY lacking in humor.  The interactions between Mr.Wilson and his two supervisors, one at the Florida newspaper and the other at the Philadelphia newspaper, were done particularly well, and can be used for training young people on making career decisions.SPOILER ALERT.  Eventually, Marley grows old.  We see him having trouble climbing steps because of arthritis.  We see him being unalert when Mr.Wilson enters a room, because of the dog's loss of hearing.  Also, Marley develops an intestinal knot.  This resolves itself, but the veterinarian warns that this particular disorder usually returns and is fatal.  And so, the intestinal knot returns, and Marley is sent to the vet again.  The vet warns that older dogs do not often survive surgery.  And so, the viewer is shown the actual procedure of euthanasia.  We see an orange-colored solution being infused in the poor old dog.  At this point, I felt that this was really ""too much information"" (TMI). I found myself wondering if the film had been funded by the Animal Euthanasia Society.  I found the euthanasia scene to be not really needed for the story.  But then, the philosophy behind this film is to eliminate any sense of a real ""story"" and to replace it with a prolonged and humorless ""slice of life"" narrative.",4,"A ""slice of life

The end might be a bit tough for children to cope with.  Okay, I'm an older man and I found it a bit tough to deal with as I reflected on the cradle-to-grave relationship I've enjoyed with the dogs in my past.Aside from the traumatic ending, I found the script to be better written than the book.  The understated, but high quality, humor was welcome in an era of over the top and gross out comedy.  The production value was good.

1233125,A33BOYMVG3U58Y,B001REZM6K,TV Critic,"[92, 95]","'Marley & Me' is a great adaptation of the novel by Josh Grogan.  It kept all the emotional elements as well as the fun.  Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson had amazing chemistry together in this heartfelt film.  It is more than just a dog movie, surpassing hit dog films such as 'Beethoven,' '101 Dalmations,' and 'Homeward Bound.'  This film concentrates on the family and how a dog affected the lives of this family for both good and bad.  It's a good representation of a young couple and how they evolve as they have children and move on in life.  Along with it, is shows the life cycle of a dog, which is something that rarely gets shown honestly in films.  It shows the good, the bad, and the painfully tragic elements of having a dog.  The end of the film is very true to the book and I'm glad because it is probably the most important part of the story and it's nice to see it portrayed honestly for fans of the book.Overall, I think viewers will enjoy this film.  Jennifer Aniston is sweet as the supportive wife and Owen Wilson shows how he's much more than playing screwball characters and can be tender and emotional as well.",5,Stayed Faithful to the Book,1235520000,"02 25, 2009",2009,1135,"[""'Marley"", 'Me', 'great', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Josh', 'Grogan', 'kept', 'emotional', 'elements', 'as', 'well', 'fun', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'had', 'amazing', 'chemistry', 'together', 'heartfelt', 'film', 'more', 'just', 'dog', 'movie', 'surpassing', 'hit', 'dog', 'films', 'such', ""'Beethoven"", ""'101"", 'Dalmations', 'Bound', 'film', 'family', 'how', 'dog', 'affected', 'lives', 'family', 'good', 'bad', 'good', 'representation', 'young', 'couple', 'how', 'evolve', 'have', 'children', 'move', 'life', 'life', 'cycle', 'dog', 'something', 'rarely', 'shown', 'honestly', 'films', 'good', 'bad', 'painfully', 'tragic', 'elements', 'having', 'dog', 'end', 'film', 'very', 'true', 'book', ""'m"", 'glad', 'probably', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'story', 'nice', 'see', 'portrayed', 'honestly', 'fans', 'book.Overall', 'think', 'viewers', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'sweet', 'supportive', 'wife', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'playing', 'screwball', 'characters', 'can', 'be', 'tender', 'emotional', 'as', 'well']",N/A
