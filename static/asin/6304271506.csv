410611,A2I17T9XB6LSGW,6304271506,Andrew McCaffrey,"[37, 39]","Criterion has done a wonderful job with this DVD release of WITHNAIL &amp; I.  The picture looks sharp, the sound is clear, and the extras are a lot of fun.  The biggest difference for me was that the only video version of this film I owned was the full-screen version that contains numerous edits.  Watching this film uncut for the first time in years really pointed out how much I had been missing with the video version.  Getting this DVD is definitely worth the money.The film itself is a joy to experience.  While the plot cannot be accused of being overcomplicated, this simplicity is more than made up for in the wonderful characters and brilliant dialogue (virtually none of which can be quoted in an all-ages forum such as this).  Loosely narrated by Paul McGann's &quot;I&quot; character, this film depicts a brief period in the life of two struggling actors as they attempt to find booze, drugs and jobs in the dying days of the 1960s.  The movie covers a wide spectrum from some scenes featuring the funniest lines that you'll ever hear to small touching moments that are surprisingly moving.  This is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys good moviemaking.Every character in the picture is superbly acted and written for.  It's a testament to Bruce Robinson's directing skills that the characters compliment each other so well instead of clashing and overbearing the others as could so easily have happened.  The secondary characters work as well as the leads and each one adds their unique flavour to the mixture.  Robinson doesn't make the mistake of giving the smaller parts too much on-screen time and having them overstay their welcome.  Each character says and does no more than they need to and leaves everyone wanting more.Richard E. Grant and Paul McGann are perfectly cast in their roles.  Each bile-covered insult roles off of Grant's tongue as if he'd been swearing at McGann all his life.  It's amazing that Grant is a teetotaler in real life and was relying on pure skill for most of his inspiration.  Excellent acting.The documentary that is included on the DVD is 30 minutes long and quite excellent.  There are interviews with Richard E. Grant (Withnail), Paul McGann (...&amp; I), Bruce Robinson (writer/director), Ralph Brown (Danny) and a host of other people related to the production.  It's a funny and enthralling look at the people and ideas behind the film.

410612,A1EI65WJC85U68,6304271506,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[2, 6]","Written and Directed by Bruce Robinson (who would later go on to make the Uma Thurman movie JENNIFER 8) WITHNAIL &amp; I is a semi-autobiographical black comedy about two struggling actors in Camdenton London during the last months of the 60s.  The future is looking rather bleak for Withnail (Richard E. Grant) and I (Paul McGann). Both are out of work and in the midst of drug and alcohol problems.  After hitting rock bottom the pair decide to take a peaceful vacation in the country and plan on how to re-establish some direction in their lives before the new decade begins.However their stay in the country turns out to be anything but tranquil when the boorish, self absorbed Withnail manages to bring out the hostilities of the locals.  Both reduced to the status of village pariahs, the unwelcome duo find themselves confined to the tiny cottage where they are forced to burn their own furniture to stay warm, and literally shooting fish in order to survive.Though the movie is a bit plodding and self-important at times; WITHNAIL &amp; I is nonetheless an absorbing and well-acted low key cult item that is worth a look for curiosity's sake. (Not something I'll have to point out to those people have seen the movie more than a dozen times! I've only seen it once.) The highlight of the movie for me is the scene in which Withnail concocts a novel way to get let off a drink driving charge.The movie was Produced by the late George Harrison, and Ringo Starr also appears in the credits as ""Richard Starkey M.B.E"".

410613,AO4WFALWQYTW0,6304271506,"Bobby Hami ""Ultimateserge""","[4, 7]","With the suspicion of rodents in the sink, Withnail surrenders to the magical powers of booze to warm himself in his disturbingly chaotic apartment. If proper care was to be taken of Withnail and his friend, simply called I, they would be best placed in quarantine out of safety for other Londoners; for their sloppiness has lead to unbearable, depressing conditions which demands that they leave London and venture to the countryside for a short holiday.Withnail & I treads along by displaying Withnail's gay, eccentric Uncle Monty and the trouble that the two have to encounter to get his country cottage-though much of the trouble has yet to hit them. With much turbulence, such as bad weather, they reach their destination safely, thinking their vacation is bound to take a turn for the best. However, as they become familiar with their whereabouts, they find that they have chosen the wrong location to alleviate all their inner-city turmoil. From hunger and fear of death, the men encounter variant other issues that make this as unpleasant a vacation as it possibly could have become. Only a visit from a familiar face could have turned this vacation to the travesty it should have been. Not only is this granted, but includes hilarious episodes of mischief that makes I's planned vacation as distressing as life was in his crummy apartment.Withnail & I is off-beat even for an English comedy, rarely offering jokes and rather reaping the benefits of its comedy from the two diverse characters, and the talented actors portraying them. The characters are similar in their interests and their profession, but much different in their temperament. I is a mild-mannered, shy actor while Withnail is an out-of-control, capricious, emotional, drunk persona who unlike I has completely been unsuccessful in his acting career as of late. With such characters, Bruce Robinson can easily profit from their back and forth dialogue and not be forced to resort to cheap gags to produce a few laughs. As funny as the dynamic between Withnail and I may be, it is limited when compared to the physical comedy of Uncle Monty in regards to I which is among one of the most amazingly, laughter-inducing conversations between straight and gay men in films in recent memory. There also a few gags that still seem both creative and funny, such as the one involved in the cooking of a rooster which is horrifyingly cruel and audaciously realistic.Writer/Director Bruce Robinson has said that I is based on himself while Withnail is based on Vivian MackKerrell whom he shared a house with. In the supplemental booklets, included in the Criterion Edition, Robinson states that even though as an actor or writer the real Withnail ( MackKerrell) did not have the passion or interest to be successful, ""Vivian was brilliant at being Vivian. That was his genius, and everyone who ever met him was overwhelmed by it...his company was worth the price."" And in these few sentences lies the entire folly of the film. Vivian MackKerrell's charm can be understood or granted, but Withnail's cannot. It is wise of Robinson to admit that ""there isn't a line of Viv's in the Withnail & I, but his horrible wine-stained tongue may as well have spoken every word. Without Viv, this story could never have been written."" The issue with Bruce Robinson film is that he has Vivian's drunken and infatuation with alcohol deeply rooted in Withnail, but has been unable to translate Vivian's charm on screen. It is unseemly why anyone would want to even remotely tolerate Withnail's drunken tantrums and tirades, his pessimism, disregard for the emotions and wishes of others, and basically buffoonery in all the serious aspects of adulthood. Of course, there are people who have such characteristics, but with a certain appeal that makes them intriguing to be around. Unfortunately, Withnail lacks that quality and it seems odd that I has tolerated him for so long-and still continues to do so-even after the events during and after the holiday. Many alcoholics are interesting people to be around because besides drinking they seem to have other interests and insights, but Withnail is in the purest sense of the word an alcoholic without any redeeming qualities.This entertaining film treads along nicely, never tiring or boring its audience, but after some time it becomes a realization that this is no coming-of-age film nor is it attempting to blossom gracefully or offer any additional insight about relationships, alcoholism, and English culture of the late 60. No, the film is simply Robinson's template for testing his writing chops and paying a tribute to one of his dear friends. Withnail & I has often been cited as one of the best British films of the last twenty five years which, if true, would seem proof of England's demising film Industry in the face of usually more apt American films. An overrated classic as it may be, Richard E Grant's breakout performance as Withnail, and Robinson's problematic but effective screenplay make Withnail & I a heartfelt effort.The Criterion Collection edition of the film also includes a thirty minute documentary with Bruce Robinson and the principal cast on the making of the film.",3,"Achieves It's Goals and Ambition, then again, their achievment

410616,AS558SNWF1DXG,6304271506,Clare Quilty,"[7, 8]","The first time I sat down to watch ""Withnail & I,"" I turned the movie off approximately five minutes into it. I'm not a squeamish viewer in any sense of the word, in fact I gravitate toward movies that don't pull any punches, but I could not take either of these guys, could not stomach the squallor, the discolored tongues, the mess in the kitchen and the dripping egg sandwich. ""Awful,"" I said of the movie. ""overrated and disgusting. Not funny!""Later that night, I became violently ill, a condition that lasted for two days and left me sweaty, feverish and delirious, unable and unwilling to consume any solid food at all. When I finally emerged from the haze, after promising myself to never take decent health for granted again, I wondered whether my impending illness had affected my opinion of ""Withnail,"" or -- on the contrary -- whether the film itself had somehow infected me with stomach flu.When I watched it again the next day, carefully sipping ginger ale, I realized that whatever had happened, I was seeing a movie that would become one of my favorites ever.Plenty of reviewers have pointed out the highlights of this film better and more faithfully than I ever could. There's so much to love: Grant's uncanny ability to channel the inebriated spirit, Danny the drug dealer (who seems to have stumbled directly out of ""Message to Love,"" the Isle of Wight concert documentary), the ""huge spade in the bath,"" Uncle Monty, the drama surrounding the diverted Wellington funds, the tea room scene, and the hopeful but heartbreaking ending.It's a shame there's no commentary on the DVD. I would've loved to have heard Bruce Robinson, Richard Grant, Paul McGann, Ralph Brown... with individual cast and crew channels. Fortunately, they at least appear in the making-of supplement that appears in the special features section (which, as ""look backs"" go is not nearly as depressing, or as schmaltzy, as the title ""Withnail & Us"" had me to believe).I think the reason that I like this movie is because I've been there. Not the English countryside in the late 60's, but i've experienced the same circumstances and i know variations of those characters, and you probably have too if you've had any wild years... i've even acted like those people once or twice.

""Daniel""","[17, 20]","Another cult movie has just entered the Criterion collection : british writer-director Bruce Robinson's 1986 WITHNAIL AND I starring Richard E. Grant and Paul McGann, both excellent. Richard Griffith as the cousin Montague and Ralph Brown as &quot; The Hippie Philosopher &quot; are hilarious. This film is a valuable addition to your library if you like english comedies, the sixties or simply a smart movie.WITHNAIL AND I is greatly autobiographical. Bruce Robinson's 25 minutes interview featuring home movies and photographies shot in London in the mid-sixties is very instructive ; one understands soon that Withnail and (&quot;I&quot;) Peter's life pictured in the movie has been the normal life of a large number of the english teenagers of the sixties. The character of &quot;Withnail&quot; played by an hallucinated Richard E. Grant, who in the real life doesn't drink alcoholic beverages, will certainly stay in the annals of Movie History.If WITHNAIL AND I moves us so much, it's because this nostalgic movie is about lost hopes, about the green pastures of our youth when the world was ready to be conquered and waiting for us. Withnail is a pathetic character who could have been a genius in any artistic domain but who didn't create anything because, after all, it wasn't so important.Apart of the Bruce Robinson interview ( look carefully at the level of the red wine in his glass... ), one will also find in this Criterion presentation a limited-edition of a poster, a theatrical trailer, liner notes by Robinson, various pre-production photos and english subtitles.A DVD zone nostalgy.",4,"HOPES,  ILLUSIONS  AND  DELUSIONS",995673600,"07 21, 2001",2001,1602,"['cult', 'movie', 'just', 'entered', 'Criterion', 'collection', 'british', 'writer-director', 'Bruce', 'Robinson', '1986', 'WITHNAIL', 'starring', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'excellent', 'Richard', 'Griffith', 'cousin', 'Montague', 'Ralph', 'Brown', 'quot', 'Hippie', 'Philosopher', 'quot', 'are', 'hilarious', 'film', 'valuable', 'addition', 'library', 'like', 'english', 'comedies', 'sixties', 'simply', 'smart', 'movie.WITHNAIL', 'AND', 'greatly', 'autobiographical', 'Bruce', 'Robinson', '25', 'minutes', 'interview', 'featuring', 'home', 'movies', 'photographies', 'shot', 'London', 'mid-sixties', 'very', 'instructive', 'one', 'soon', 'Withnail', 'quot', 'quot', 'Peter', 'life', 'pictured', 'movie', 'been', 'normal', 'life', 'large', 'number', 'english', 'teenagers', 'sixties', 'character', 'quot', 'Withnail', 'quot', 'played', 'hallucinated', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'who', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'drink', 'alcoholic', 'beverages', 'will', 'certainly', 'stay', 'annals', 'Movie', 'History.If', 'WITHNAIL', 'AND', 'moves', 'so', 'much', 'nostalgic', 'movie', 'lost', 'hopes', 'green', 'pastures', 'youth', 'when', 'world', 'was', 'ready', 'be', 'conquered', 'waiting', 'Withnail', 'pathetic', 'character', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'genius', 'artistic', 'domain', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'create', 'anything', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'important.Apart', 'Bruce', 'Robinson', 'interview', 'look', 'carefully', 'level', 'red', 'wine', 'glass', 'one', 'will', 'also', 'find', 'Criterion', 'presentation', 'limited-edition', 'poster', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'liner', 'notes', 'Robinson', 'various', 'pre-production', 'photos', 'english', 'subtitles.A', 'DVD', 'zone', 'nostalgy']",Withnail & I VHS

Taylor ""GFT""","[4, 4]","Some humor doesn't really transcend the culture that spawned it, and such is sometimes the case with the extremely English WITHNAIL AND I, an extremely witty, highly quoteable, and exceptionally toxic tale of two alcohol-swilling, drug popping, and out-of-work young actors who go an extremely ill-advised weekend vacation in 1969 England.  Often labled as a ""black comedy,"" it is very black indeed, asking us to be amused by a series of highly unsympathetic characters who really have no one to blame for their misfortunes except themselves.The film is more character portrait than plot, and the portrait upon which it hinges is Withnail (Richard E. Grant), a clearly talented but completely unrestrained entity who is going to hell with a bottle in hand and taking his friend Marwood (Paul McGann) along for the ride.  Both are coming off a sixty-hour spree, find themselves depressed by their wildly sordid quarters and the vulgarities of London, and at Marwood's prompting decide to take a break.They impose upon Withnail's uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths), described as a ""raving homosexual,"" for the use of his country place--but once there find it isolated, decayed, without provisions, and surrounded by an extremely unattractive assortment of rural locals.  Unbeknownst to Marwood, Withnail has actually secured use of the country place by telling Uncle Monty that Marwood is gay; not surprisingly, Uncle Monty eventually shows up with food, drink, and lust in his heart.  Needless to say, one awful incident leads to another before Withnail and Marwood return to London, where a twist of fate leads them to a final parting of the ways.The actors are truly the thing here.  Grant is a knock-out as Withnail, spewing arrogance and viciousness, and making outrageous use of everyone who comes his way in brilliant comic fashion; McGann holds his own as the more sensible but easily led Marwood.  Griffiths is quite clever in his deeply ironic role of a profoundly silly homosexual who unexpectedly proves the only person in the cast to have any sense of integrity, and Ralph Brown scores in the role of ultra-dense yet oddly intelligent drug dealer Danny.  But the whole film is so remarkably poisonous that it becomes increasingly difficult to relate, much less sympathize, with the various characters.  The conclusion is uniquely bitter, a portent of an alcoholic hell yet to come.On the whole, I do recommend the film, and the Criterion Edition is quite fine, with a handsome making-of documentary that traces the history of the film.  But it is worth pointing out that a cult film is one that provokes an unexpectedly positive response in a MINORITY of viewers--and you may or may not be among them.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",4,"Yes, No, and Maybe: England's Great Cult Film",1237507200,"03 20, 2009",2009,2729,"['humor', ""n't"", 'really', 'transcend', 'culture', 'spawned', 'such', 'sometimes', 'case', 'extremely', 'English', 'WITHNAIL', 'AND', 'extremely', 'witty', 'highly', 'quoteable', 'exceptionally', 'toxic', 'tale', 'two', 'alcohol-swilling', 'drug', 'popping', 'out-of-work', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'go', 'extremely', 'ill-advised', 'weekend', 'vacation', '1969', 'England', 'Often', 'labled', 'black', 'comedy', 'very', 'black', 'indeed', 'asking', 'be', 'amused', 'series', 'highly', 'unsympathetic', 'characters', 'who', 'really', 'have', 'one', 'blame', 'misfortunes', 'themselves.The', 'film', 'more', 'character', 'portrait', 'plot', 'portrait', 'Withnail', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'clearly', 'talented', 'completely', 'unrestrained', 'entity', 'who', 'going', 'hell', 'bottle', 'hand', 'taking', 'friend', 'Marwood', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'ride', 'are', 'coming', 'off', 'sixty-hour', 'spree', 'find', 'depressed', 'wildly', 'sordid', 'quarters', 'vulgarities', 'London', 'Marwood', 'prompting', 'decide', 'take', 'break.They', 'impose', 'Withnail', 'uncle', 'Monty', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'described', 'raving', 'homosexual', 'use', 'country', 'place', 'once', 'there', 'find', 'isolated', 'decayed', 'provisions', 'surrounded', 'extremely', 'unattractive', 'assortment', 'rural', 'locals', 'Unbeknownst', 'Marwood', 'Withnail', 'actually', 'secured', 'use', 'country', 'place', 'telling', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'Marwood', 'gay', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'eventually', 'up', 'food', 'drink', 'lust', 'heart', 'Needless', 'say', 'one', 'awful', 'incident', 'Withnail', 'Marwood', 'return', 'London', 'where', 'twist', 'fate', 'final', 'parting', 'ways.The', 'actors', 'are', 'truly', 'thing', 'here', 'Grant', 'knock-out', 'Withnail', 'spewing', 'arrogance', 'viciousness', 'making', 'outrageous', 'use', 'everyone', 'who', 'way', 'brilliant', 'comic', 'fashion', 'McGann', 'own', 'more', 'sensible', 'easily', 'led', 'Marwood', 'Griffiths', 'quite', 'clever', 'deeply', 'ironic', 'role', 'profoundly', 'silly', 'homosexual', 'who', 'unexpectedly', 'only', 'person', 'cast', 'have', 'sense', 'integrity', 'Ralph', 'Brown', 'scores', 'role', 'ultra-dense', 'yet', 'oddly', 'intelligent', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Danny', 'whole', 'film', 'so', 'remarkably', 'poisonous', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'relate', 'much', 'less', 'sympathize', 'various', 'characters', 'conclusion', 'uniquely', 'bitter', 'portent', 'alcoholic', 'hell', 'yet', 'come.On', 'whole', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'Criterion', 'Edition', 'quite', 'fine', 'handsome', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'history', 'film', 'worth', 'pointing', 'out', 'cult', 'film', 'one', 'unexpectedly', 'positive', 'response', 'MINORITY', 'viewers', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'them.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Withnail & I VHS

410632,A3RB6NQOLOBXYD,6304271506,"Jimmy Lee ""James""","[2, 2]","This British cult classic is adapted from writer Bruce Robinson's unpublished novel where the script takes on a somewhat autobiographical role detailing Robinson's life in London during the the 1960's.Meet Withnail, (Richard E Grant) and his friend ""I"" (Paul McGann) ; two struggling unemployed actors living in a horrid flat in London during the 1960's. Withnail is a loud, cowardly, deeply pessimistic, obnoxious and selfish alcoholic, but highly entertaining no less. Meanwhile, I is completely tolerant, reticent and reasonable not only with Withnail but most of the other fellow Londoners too. Like Withnail, he also likes his dose of the bottle but does exercise a little more forbearance. Upon realizing their horrible living conditions and need for employment they decide to visit Uncle Monty; a raging intellectual homosexual with a fine taste for the bottle too and a fine appreciation of the liberal arts as well. Withnail uses his skillful persuasion to convince Uncle Monty to lend him his key to his beautiful cottage in the countryside.  When Withnail secures the key, he and his friend delve off into the countryside but soon find out how little prepared they are for the getaway, well, at least for I anyway; a desolate cottage with a few nearby farm animals and a strange rural neighbor is quite a change indeed. As food and alcohol prove to be a difficult task to fulfill their high demands, the savior Uncle Monty makes an unexpected appearance during the middle of the night only to frighten the day lights out of Withnail while he quivers in I's bed. (A very funny scene) It is here where Withnail takes a complete enjoyment of Uncle Monty's company so long as the fine wine and food is replenished daily; however, I is left with Uncle Monty's homosexual advances that are quite amusing. Witnail is aware of this and misleads Monty into believing I is a repressed homosexual that cannot face society's ridicule. This subsequence confrontation is hilarious and worth many viewings. Unfortunately, for I, his brief stay in the countryside is just as miserable as it was in London. The confrontation between I and Monty is the last straw. Withnail and I leave at once and return to London where I discovers he has been called for an audition.The film is worth multiple viewings (No diminishing returns I can rest assure you) and the film is definitely a keeper in anyones film library. Although the film is entertaining and quite likable, I do agree with a reviewer's opinion of the conflicting comparison between Withnail and the real life character he is based on (Vivian McKerrell). If one were to read the supplement notes carefully in the Criterion booklet one will realize how the real life person portrayed on screen are at complete odds with each other. Bruce Robinson paints a very different portrait of Vivian who seems very charismatic and likable, or as he states in the notes, "" His company alone was worth any crime"". Unlike Vivian, Withnail is anything but charismatic or socially likable but very selfish and cowardly, but still highly entertaining. Like the other reviewer posted, Bruce Robinson seemed to take one aspect of Vivian, (Borderline Alcoholism) and render this flaw as the main entertaining force through Wihnail's character in the entire film. Don't get me wrong, the character is still highly entertaining and it didn't strike me as a detraction from the film's humor. But what I think maybe an issue is the fact that Vivian's character may have been potentially short changed on screen. I still think Richard E Grant did a fantastic job and the film holds up in my view.",4,"""The Criterion Collection Keeps a Sensational Cellar"" !",1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,3621,"['British', 'cult', 'classic', 'adapted', 'writer', 'Bruce', 'Robinson', 'unpublished', 'novel', 'where', 'script', 'somewhat', 'autobiographical', 'role', 'detailing', 'Robinson', 'life', 'London', ""1960's.Meet"", 'Withnail', 'Richard', 'E', 'Grant', 'friend', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'two', 'struggling', 'unemployed', 'actors', 'living', 'horrid', 'flat', 'London', '1960', 'Withnail', 'loud', 'cowardly', 'deeply', 'pessimistic', 'obnoxious', 'selfish', 'alcoholic', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'less', 'Meanwhile', 'completely', 'tolerant', 'reticent', 'reasonable', 'not', 'only', 'Withnail', 'most', 'other', 'fellow', 'Londoners', 'too', 'Withnail', 'also', 'dose', 'bottle', 'exercise', 'little', 'more', 'forbearance', 'realizing', 'horrible', 'living', 'conditions', 'need', 'employment', 'decide', 'visit', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'raging', 'intellectual', 'homosexual', 'fine', 'taste', 'bottle', 'too', 'fine', 'appreciation', 'liberal', 'arts', 'as', 'well', 'Withnail', 'skillful', 'persuasion', 'convince', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'lend', 'key', 'beautiful', 'cottage', 'countryside', 'When', 'Withnail', 'key', 'friend', 'delve', 'off', 'countryside', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'little', 'prepared', 'are', 'getaway', 'well', 'least', 'anyway', 'desolate', 'cottage', 'few', 'nearby', 'farm', 'animals', 'strange', 'rural', 'neighbor', 'quite', 'change', 'indeed', 'food', 'alcohol', 'prove', 'be', 'difficult', 'task', 'fulfill', 'high', 'demands', 'savior', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'unexpected', 'appearance', 'middle', 'night', 'only', 'frighten', 'day', 'Withnail', 'bed', 'very', 'funny', 'scene', 'here', 'where', 'Withnail', 'complete', 'enjoyment', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'company', 'so', 'long', 'fine', 'wine', 'food', 'replenished', 'daily', 'however', 'left', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'homosexual', 'advances', 'are', 'quite', 'amusing', 'Witnail', 'aware', 'Monty', 'believing', 'repressed', 'homosexual', 'can', 'not', 'face', 'society', 'ridicule', 'subsequence', 'confrontation', 'hilarious', 'worth', 'many', 'viewings', 'Unfortunately', 'brief', 'stay', 'countryside', 'just', 'as', 'miserable', 'was', 'London', 'confrontation', 'Monty', 'last', 'straw', 'Withnail', 'leave', 'once', 'return', 'London', 'where', 'been', 'called', 'audition.The', 'film', 'worth', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'diminishing', 'returns', 'can', 'rest', 'assure', 'film', 'definitely', 'keeper', 'anyones', 'film', 'library', 'film', 'entertaining', 'quite', 'likable', 'do', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'conflicting', 'comparison', 'Withnail', 'real', 'life', 'character', 'based', 'Vivian', 'McKerrell', 'one', 'were', 'read', 'supplement', 'carefully', 'Criterion', 'booklet', 'one', 'will', 'realize', 'how', 'real', 'life', 'person', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'are', 'complete', 'odds', 'other', 'Bruce', 'Robinson', 'very', 'different', 'portrait', 'Vivian', 'who', 'very', 'charismatic', 'likable', 'notes', 'company', 'alone', 'was', 'worth', 'crime', 'Vivian', 'Withnail', 'anything', 'charismatic', 'socially', 'likable', 'very', 'selfish', 'cowardly', 'still', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'other', 'reviewer', 'posted', 'Bruce', 'Robinson', 'seemed', 'take', 'one', 'aspect', 'Vivian', 'Borderline', 'Alcoholism', 'render', 'flaw', 'main', 'entertaining', 'force', 'Wihnail', 'character', 'entire', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'character', 'still', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'detraction', 'film', 'humor', 'what', 'think', 'maybe', 'issue', 'fact', 'Vivian', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'potentially', 'short', 'changed', 'screen', 'still', 'think', 'Richard', 'E', 'Grant', 'did', 'fantastic', 'job', 'film', 'up', 'view']",Withnail & I VHS

Grant plays Withnail, with Paul McGann playing Marwood (who's never actually called that in the film and is credited as ""& I""). Withnail and Marwood are two out of work actors living in squalor in Camden Town, London circa 1969. Constantly drunk, the two decide to escape to the English countryside for a while, by staying at Withnail's gay Uncle Monty's cottage. Things get very interesting when Monty (Richard Griffiths) arrives and shows them his love for life...And his interest for Marwood.Withnail and I is filled with wry, British humor. Not all of it is laugh-out-loud funny, but all of it is amusing. The performances are all delightful, with McGann perfect as Marwood. Grant however is particularly impressive as Withnail. The character is rarely seen sober or without a cigarette dangling from his lip. Grant plays this character with a certain wide-eyed eccentricity that makes him both loveable and incredibly memorable.It's a brilliant piece of character acting.One of the things that make Withnail and I so enduring is the scenes. The film admittedly doesn't have much of a plot to speak of but has more great scenes than even the most complicated film. Not a single scene feels too long or unnecessary and scenes like Marwood confronting a bull or Withnail ""making time"" to a soundtrack of Hendrix's ""Voodoo Chile"" will remain in your memory.The film is filled with grin-inducing dialogue and hilarious situations, notably when Monty attempts to convince Marwood that Marwood is gay and to avoid an unpleasant situation, Marwood must convince Monty he actually is.Beneath all the drugs, alcohol, and cursing; Withnail and I also manages to touch on universal themes, like friendship. And, let it be known, this is a great movie about friendship. Withnail and Marwood are a sort of alcoholic, witty, British Butch and Sundance.Despite its low budget and nothing stand-out by way of cinematography, set-design, or anything like that, Withnail and I is a brilliantly scripted and acted film that deserves a large audience.

410640,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,6304271506,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[5, 5]","Withnail and I is the kind of movie that has a huge cult following over here in Britain, although surprisingly there are still many people who haven't seen it.  It concerns two out-of-work actors, Withnail (Richard E. Grant) and I (Paul McGann), who take a weekend break in a cottage on loan from Withnail's uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths).  Whilst there everything that could go wrong does, leading to a peculiarly fitting conclusion.The humour is undoubtedly caustic as well as being undeniably British in its sharp take on situation comedy.  This is probably best summed up by saying that you don't know whether you should be sympathetic for the characters or laugh at them.  Despite this biting humour though, which in itself makes it worth a watch, the excellent acting is obviously of note.  Richard E. Grant is one of the those actors that everyone has seen in one or two films but can't really figure out why he's so famous.  Well this is it.  His performance as Withnail is the kind of career-defining performance that is all too hard to come by.  He manages to express comedy, self-loathing, bitterness and humanity in what is perhaps one of the most realistic performances of the 80's.  Of course, Paul McGann's performance never really launched him into the stratosphere, although on many counts it's hard to see why: although in a much less showy role than Grant, he is just as good in the role that he plays as the more sympathetic 'I' of the title.All in all this is a movie that once seen will not be forgotten.

410642,A1SHPX0VCXMRXT,6304271506,"Mr. S. A. Lukacs ""Simbob""","[6, 7]","The quintissential British comedy. Set in the fag end (that's cigarrette end) of the 60's in the squalid bedsits of London, Withnail and I is a tale of two aspiring young actors; the pompous and deranged Withnail (Richard E. Grant) and the quietly reserved &quot;I&quot; (Paul McGann). The film follows their increasingly debauched downward spiral as they try to live with no money, no food, no heating, a hideously filthy kitchen infested with rats and, more importantly, no booze! Add to this their frequently unwanted house guest, drug dealing hippy Danny (A scene stealing turn by Ralph Brown), and a near fight with a stocky Irish homophobe who believes them, wrongly, to be gay, they decide that a trip to the country is in order to help revitalise themselves. And so they stay with Witnail's Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths) which leads to a second act full of crossed wires, fish out of water exploits and unwanted sexual advances. To give too much away would spoil this wonderful film.The film is funny without relying on jokes. The humour comes from the situations, the immensly quotable dialogue: &quot;We want cake, and the finest wines available to humanity... and we want them here and we want them now,&quot; blathers a drunken Withnail as he and &quot;I&quot; frequent a quaint english tea and cake shop, upsetting the locals.The magic is in the details. Writer/Director Bruce Robinson, who almost didn't make the film after the success, and subsequent Oscar win, for his &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; screenplay, recreates an era which he knows all to well. The film is loosely based on his experiences, with &quot;I&quot;, the films narrator (originally referred to in the script as Marwood) being his alter ego. Withnail is very muched based on his flatmate Vivien, who, yes it's true, did drink lighter fuel and went blind for days. Michael Elphick, another flat mate of Robinson's, even makes an appearance as a poacher.Withnail and I is as poignant as it is funny, capturing a period where so many young artists fell by the wayside. Watching the finale in London zoo, you can only assume the worst will happen to Withnail. It was a decade of so much unfullfilled promise, as summed up by Danny: &quot;We are reaching the end of the greatest decade in the history of mankind, and as my friend Presuming Ed consistently points out... we have failed to paint it black!&quot;",5,&quot;Man delights not me&quot;,1003104000,"10 15, 2001",2001,2393,"['quintissential', 'British', 'comedy', 'Set', 'fag', 'end', 'cigarrette', 'end', '60', 'squalid', 'bedsits', 'London', 'Withnail', 'tale', 'two', 'aspiring', 'young', 'actors', 'pompous', 'deranged', 'Withnail', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'quietly', 'reserved', 'quot', 'quot', 'Paul', 'McGann', 'film', 'increasingly', 'debauched', 'downward', 'spiral', 'try', 'live', 'money', 'food', 'heating', 'hideously', 'filthy', 'kitchen', 'infested', 'rats', 'more', 'importantly', 'booze', 'Add', 'frequently', 'unwanted', 'house', 'guest', 'drug', 'dealing', 'hippy', 'Danny', 'A', 'scene', 'stealing', 'turn', 'Ralph', 'Brown', 'near', 'fight', 'stocky', 'Irish', 'homophobe', 'who', 'wrongly', 'be', 'gay', 'decide', 'trip', 'country', 'order', 'help', 'revitalise', 'so', 'stay', 'Witnail', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'Richard', 'Griffiths', 'second', 'act', 'full', 'crossed', 'wires', 'fish', 'water', 'exploits', 'unwanted', 'sexual', 'advances', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'would', 'spoil', 'wonderful', 'film.The', 'film', 'funny', 'relying', 'jokes', 'humour', 'situations', 'immensly', 'quotable', 'dialogue', 'quot', 'want', 'cake', 'finest', 'wines', 'available', 'humanity', 'want', 'here', 'want', 'now', 'quot', 'blathers', 'drunken', 'Withnail', 'quot', 'quot', 'frequent', 'quaint', 'english', 'tea', 'cake', 'shop', 'upsetting', 'locals.The', 'magic', 'details', 'Writer/Director', 'Bruce', 'Robinson', 'who', 'almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'success', 'subsequent', 'Oscar', 'win', 'quot', 'Killing', 'Fields', 'quot', 'screenplay', 'era', 'well', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'experiences', 'quot', 'quot', 'films', 'narrator', 'originally', 'referred', 'script', 'Marwood', 'being', 'alter', 'ego', 'Withnail', 'very', 'muched', 'based', 'flatmate', 'Vivien', 'who', 'true', 'did', 'drink', 'lighter', 'fuel', 'went', 'days', 'Michael', 'Elphick', 'flat', 'mate', 'Robinson', 'even', 'appearance', 'poacher.Withnail', 'as', 'poignant', 'funny', 'capturing', 'period', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'young', 'artists', 'fell', 'wayside', 'Watching', 'finale', 'London', 'zoo', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'worst', 'will', 'happen', 'Withnail', 'was', 'decade', 'so', 'much', 'unfullfilled', 'promise', 'summed', 'up', 'Danny', 'quot', 'are', 'reaching', 'end', 'greatest', 'decade', 'history', 'mankind', 'friend', 'Presuming', 'Ed', 'consistently', 'out', 'have', 'failed', 'paint', 'black', 'quot']",Withnail & I VHS

410649,A1IZWTVAQVJIFE,6304271506,Rerevisionist,"[3, 19]","Backhandedly realistic.[1] Richard E Grant's autobiography shows his life was not entirely unlike this film, though he was luckier than Withnail - this film had the same effect LOTR had on Elijah Wood. Grant did the filmic version of dining out on it forever after.The plot barely exists: 'resting' actor gets a part, his friend doesn't. Grant got the part presumably because of his ability to act a sort of decayed English aristocrat - actor's voice, piercing blue eyes, tall upright posture - with good manners if he wants to switch them on. His indignation on being slighted - ""how DARE you!"" - is made absurd by his lack of power. ""I've only had a few ales!"" - ""Look here, my cousin's a QC!"" Faced with a difficult situation, paralysing fear floods up inside him.[2] The other characters are minor, and in their way reflect decline: his friend, 'I', seems to me utterly uninteresting as an actor. Richard Griffiths as the queer uncle - books, cat, stuffed settee, Schubert, token theatricals, and 'the Dane' - lives on money of unspecified source, possessor of capital with no aim in life - unless you count trying to bugger young men without checking whether they're interested. The Camberwell carrot chap reflects a part of that era - the silly business ideas, the weird UFO style ideas such as razor blades sharpened by pyramids, the drugs. The pointless rural types have lifestyles which are 'irrelevant' to everything - no wonder the word 'irrelevant' became intransitive. The absurd immigrant, black Jamaican I think, courtesy of Heathrow, makes inappropriate chants of ""rama"" (possibly to save money contractually). The alcoholic pub owner with no doubt fake quarter-century old second world war memories. All are at sea while the political and economic vultures circle. They have no interest in the external world. Angus Wilson's novels showed 1950s British intellectuals saying nothing much, and this was acute observation. Certainly it applies here.[3] The film has a claustral feeling, of money saved by maximising interior shots. The built environment where it's shown is universally decrepit. The lincrusta in the hall below the dado rail looks absurd. A wrecking ball scene shows Victorian brick houses being demolished. The pubs are seedy; the greasy spoon is seedy; the people if possible seedier. The 'Mother Red Cap' must presumably have been genuine, though I don't recall it, its IRA graffiti the only political reference in the entire film, unless you count the junk news headlines. Compendium Books isn't shown - pity. The Penrith tea room I think is genuine, though the staff in the film could not have been. Incidentally the more or less derelict farm is Sleddale Hall, near Shap, Cumbria; apparently it's still more or less derelict.[4] I noticed George Harrison's mate Richard Starkey MBE had some input, as did Steadman - the Withnail logo, no doubt. I thought the sound track was surprisingly weak given the possibilities from 1969. I couldn't help noticing there's a footstep editor, and someone called 'Shaun, the wardrobe mistress'. I know nothing about Paul Heller. The film could be regarded as a vignette showing an American or perhaps Jewish view of an England laid low.[5] The caricature element is the only way the film gets its effects. Drunk driving and variations on the theme of an almost unusable car with fake tyre squeals. Inability to make food. ""Young people take drugs without understanding what harm they can do"" - a doctor told me, commenting on the incredible stupidity of taking dangerous stuff. Non-stop drugs, booze, and lack of food are shown as having little physical effect. Withnail down lighter fuel at one point - in fact, it was vinegar, secretly substituted for water to elicit a realistic choking performance. Could this be a deliberate propaganda effort?

The story follows the antics of two young actors who are seeking work in the trendy London of the late 60s, drinking their way to oblivion to blunt their neurotic hysteria.  At turns pathetic, hilarious, witty, and disturbing, the two actors are truly wonderful.  In a masterful performance, Richard Grant established his reputation as an eccentric Englishman with this film.  While this is a black comedy, it is also completely believable.Frazzled with the city life, they decide they need to take a vacation in the wintry countryside, securing the permission of Withnail's obese, lascivious uncle, who has designs on the young Marwood (who serves as narrator).  Once they arrive without food or fuel, they are shocked at the primitive conditions they find; the countryfolk are taciturn and unreceptive to their antics, but this doesn't stop them from getting loudly drunk in local pubs and insulting anyone more straight-laced than them.  Upon the arrival of the uncle, Marwood is relentlessly accosted until he lies (or so I think) his way out of his clutches.  They return to the chaos in London and finally part.  It is the end of the 60s scene.This is brilliant filmmaking, one of the most interesting post-Beatle projects of George Harrison.

The funniest films mine this trove of despairing exigencies in an urgent, played-for-real mode. And none do it better than WITHNAIL & I, now available in a superb uncut version on DVD.Bruce Robinson, the sometime actor and screenwriter (""The Killing Fields""), made his 1986 directorial debut with his semi-autobiographical screenplay that is widely considered the greatest neglected comedy of all time. The slender plot is simple. Flatmates Richard E. Grant (Withnail) and Paul McGann (& I) are two stoned, hungry, broke, and out-of-work actors wallowing in self-made squalor. When they get an opportunity to spend a weekend in the country cottage of Withnail's three hundred pound Uncle Montague, they go, hoping to ""rejuvenate."" What ensues is an extraordinarily deranged weekend of drunken delusion and distraught discovery that you will never forget. To reveal any more story details would be a gross disservice to those who have not yet found this wonderfully twisted, honest and perfect film.Richard Griffiths is unsettling as the campy, dissolute predator cousin Montague and Ralph Brown is spot-on as Danny, the slow-talking, menacing but philosophical dope dealer. Hard to believe this was Richard E. Grant's first film. Even harder to believe is that he is a non-drinker who doesn't smoke.Perfectly cast, nearly every spoken line is unfiltered emotional truth and most are quotable -- especially the caustic diatribes of drunken, acerbic Grant. And the scenes themselves are brilliant set-pieces that unfold like diamonds in the rough being cut to gem-stone perfection.After experiencing this unblinking look back at the end of the 60s in a London suburb where a tenuous friendship, high expectations and unfulfilled dreams collide during a disastrous weekend getaway, you too will laugh when you next hear the opening riffs of Jimmy Hendrix's ""Voodoo Child."" And you will understand when someone blurts out in a restaurant, ""We want the finest wines available to humanity. We want them here and we want them NOW!. And cake.""This new Criterion widescreen version is clean and sharp and there's a too-short bonus interview with Robinson, Brown, Grant and McGann.You must trust me on this one, so right now, get on line and order this extraordinary movie. It's one to own and watch at least once a month. It will put everything in the proper perspective and cure what ails you.

410654,A1WBXDI7LRPLXB,6304271506,R. Sohi,"[6, 7]","Back in the late 80s, when I was in university, watching this low budget British film (on a gradually deteriorating videotape) was almost a weekly ritual for my friends and I. On the rare occasions it would be shown at one of the 2nd run theatres in town we'd be sure to catch it on the big screen. Later we'd obnoxiously try to outdo each other quoting its hilarious dialogue, while each of our girlfriends rolled their eyes and probably questioned themselves about whether their boyfriend was really the kind of man they'd want to father their children. I'm slightly embarrassed to admit that during those years I probably saw this film about thirty times. In the following decades I read the screenplay, Richard E. Grant's film diaries (he's the actor who plays Withnail) and Bruce Robinson's unrelated novel along with a very enjoyable collection of interviews with him. A documentary accompanying the film on this disk shows that my behavior was typical of the film's legion of fans. It can inspire that kind of devotion.Watching Criterion's superb edition of ""Withnail and I"" recently was like running into an old buddy after many years. The film's mordant charm hasn't dated at all. It's a film about two perpetually intoxicated, unemployed actors and the gradual disintegration of their tenuous friendship as one starts to outgrow the other.  The film has the thinnest of plots but is presented with such wit and intelligence that, if it speaks to you, will seem nothing short of brilliant.  The DVD release, in what seems to be a great transfer has the added bonus of a nostalgic documentary about the making of the film and the cult that surrounds it.  Only the addition of a commentary track to the film would have improved this release. If you're already a fan of the film, you owe it to yourself to at least see the Criterion edition, even if you end up owning some lesser version. What makes this film great is the dialogue and acting.

410657,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,6304271506,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[2, 2]","""Withnail & I"" is the kind of droll British comedy that is loved by some and goes completely over the heads of most others. With that said, I'm sure you already know just which group you belong to. I find myself in the former, and yet, I will also admit that ""Withnail & I"" can be very trying even to me, it's also very, very funny. The movie's biggest draw back is in it's main characters, who I would never for a moment refer to as heroes, they are not particularly likable, in fact, often they are down right unlikable.The story is set in the 1960's, and follows the misadventures of two struggling actors, Withnail (Richard E. Grant) & I (Paul McGann), who as the movies begins are in a state of major despair over their lack of employment, lack of booze and more lack of booze. Fleeing their flat, possibly because their dirty dishes have backed up to the point that McGann's ""& I"" believes that they have taken on a life of their own, or at least are harboring some sort of life form. Withnail convinces his Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths) into lending them his cottage in the countryside, once their they discover things to be no better, perhaps even a different kind of worst.The movie works in no small part thanks to director Bruce Robinson's dryly witty script, I almost think it would read better than it plays out as a film, in fact I could imagine a continuing series of novels or stories about the adventures of withnail & I. The performances, though, are the real key to this film's success. Richard E. Grant is the ideal actor to portray Withnail, he's arrogant, obnoxious, cynical, manipulative and completely unapologetic about it, it's in his manner of bringing Withnail to life that's make it work so well, he's a jerk and I sure wouldn't to be his friend, but god help me, their is something loveable and wonderful about him. The other great performance in the movie belongs to Richard Griffiths, a great British character actor perhaps best known today for his role as Uncle Vernon in the Harry Potter franchise, here he plays the lovable, eccentric and flamboyantly gay Uncle Monty. Griffith infuses his character with great humor and tenderness, even when threatening to bugger McGann. Paul McGann, the least remember actor to portray Doctor Who, has the thankless role portraying the most likable character in the film, thus being the dullest and least interesting.Some people swear by this film, some people I respect very much do so, but I am not one of them. I laughed a lot, I like the actors and the script, but I just couldn't ever work up enough kind feeling for these people.

A pean to 60s romanticism, alcoholism, individuality and talent sordidly and tragically pissed up the wall. Withnail and Marwood are two 'resting' actors living in magnificent squalor in Camden Town in the late 1960s. Frustrated and depressed with their existence, a pile of fetid washing up in the sink and Withnail with a recklessly unstable antifreeze drinking habit (the film has spawned its own drinking game), they manage to escape to a Lake District cottage for a weekend courtesy of Withnail's obese pederast uncle Monty, who legend has it is based on a real life tutor at Oxford University (still teaching - many people know who he is!)The weekend turns sour as the dysfunctional duo face pouring rain, hostile locals and an awareness that their practical survival skills are about as effective as, well, as you imagine they would be from dissolute actors. They struggle to find food and wood, and hunker down for a grim weekend when Monty himself appears. They settle down to a classic roast lunch and liberal amounts of claret, but come the evening Monty reveals his intentions towards Marwood. The film gets funnier and funnier as social relations breakdown, and the final scene with Richard E. Grant unleashing a Hamlet soliloquy in the pouring rain is a poignant testament to the deep and noble frustration of the thwarted creative personality.The quotable lines from this movie are abundant.

I didn't much understand it then, before I became an Anglophile.  It was a bit murky and I could barely understand the dialect.  But after almost 24 years, and several trips to London, I love the film now more than ever.I had returned from a trip to London in '03, and became reacquainted with the film during a few cold rainy days of repeats on some cable channel as I was recovering from my trip, and the depression that often follows. I'm really not sure why I like the films plot other than it's a snapshot in the life of two out of work actors, and the soggy adventure they have over a weekend spent at a country cottage owned by Withnail's Uncle Monty.  A couple of other interesting characters lend interest and humour at the end of the film, and serve to underscore the last year of the 1960's.  It is a very nostalgic and funny look into that period when England was suffering economically, and the drugs movement was still so predominant.  The dialogue is classic, and the music is perfect for the somber and yet humorous tone, especially the score.  The ending is perfect, and I'm not sure what Richard Grant's character is quoting, but it does the job.  However, if one isn't accustomed to British English, he or she might have to put on the closed caption and curl up sometime with a book of British slang and expressions.It's very nice on blu-ray, but one has to crank the sound for the dialogue, and tone it down for the music, and that's a complaint I have with a couple of other blu-rays.",5,Excellent Classic British Film,1288569600,"11 1, 2010",2010,1610,"['first', 'saw', 'film', '1987', 'when', 'friend', 'mine', 'who', 'worked', 'AFI', 'Hollywood', 'took', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'understand', 'then', 'became', 'Anglophile', 'was', 'bit', 'murky', 'could', 'barely', 'understand', 'dialect', 'almost', '24', 'years', 'several', 'trips', 'London', 'love', 'film', 'now', 'more', 'ever.I', 'had', 'returned', 'trip', 'London', ""'03"", 'became', 'reacquainted', 'film', 'few', 'cold', 'rainy', 'days', 'repeats', 'cable', 'channel', 'was', 'recovering', 'trip', 'depression', 'often', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'like', 'films', 'plot', 'other', 'snapshot', 'life', 'two', 'work', 'actors', 'soggy', 'adventure', 'have', 'over', 'weekend', 'spent', 'country', 'cottage', 'owned', 'Withnail', 'Uncle', 'Monty', 'A', 'couple', 'other', 'interesting', 'characters', 'lend', 'interest', 'humour', 'end', 'film', 'serve', 'underscore', 'last', 'year', '1960', 'very', 'nostalgic', 'funny', 'look', 'period', 'when', 'England', 'was', 'suffering', 'economically', 'drugs', 'movement', 'was', 'still', 'so', 'predominant', 'dialogue', 'classic', 'music', 'perfect', 'somber', 'yet', 'humorous', 'tone', 'especially', 'score', 'ending', 'perfect', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Richard', 'Grant', 'character', 'quoting', 'job', 'However', 'one', ""n't"", 'accustomed', 'British', 'English', 'might', 'have', 'put', 'closed', 'caption', 'curl', 'up', 'sometime', 'book', 'British', 'slang', 'expressions.It', 'very', 'nice', 'blu-ray', 'one', 'crank', 'sound', 'dialogue', 'tone', 'down', 'music', 'complaint', 'have', 'couple', 'other', 'blu-rays']",Withnail & I VHS
