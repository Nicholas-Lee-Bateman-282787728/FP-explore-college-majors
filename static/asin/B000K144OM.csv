1030171,APPJNVNF4BFLB,B000K144OM,ConnieP,"[2, 2]","I first learned of George Muller when our pastor spoke about him during a recent sermon.  Being someone who doesn't have as much faith as she'd like, I was very intrigued.  I came across this DVD on Amazon, so I ordered it.  It is a great documentary about Muller's life.  It was so interesting to me how this rebellious young man turned his life completely around after attending a bible meeting with a friend.  Muller was so moved; he felt the Lord calling upon him.  Once Muller answered God's calling, God answered each and every one of Muller's prayers with unbelievable timing.  It was truly amazing to see how time and time again, God answered his prayers, whether it be food for the orphanage children or lifting the fog so Muller could stay on schedule.It was interesting for me to note that Muller suffered great losses throughout his life, yet his faith never waivered.  He lost his son, his wife, his second wife, and his daughter, all at early ages.  In addition, he had serious health problems himself.  I do not know if Muller prayed for their individual heelings or not.  The prayers discussed in the DVD all dealt with Muller's mission for God, all of which were answered.In addition to the 1-hour documentary, two special features are included on this DVD.  ""Muller:  A Second Look"" (28 min.) gives a further look at the man himself and ""Muller's Children"" (18 min.) features former orphans, now adults, speaking of their time at the orphanage.I found Muller's faith to be truly inspirational and recommend this DVD.",5,Fascinating story of one man's faith journey,1367798400,"05 6, 2013",2013,1534,"['first', 'learned', 'George', 'Muller', 'when', 'pastor', 'spoke', 'recent', 'sermon', 'Being', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'faith', ""'d"", 'like', 'was', 'very', 'intrigued', 'came', 'DVD', 'Amazon', 'ordered', 'great', 'documentary', 'Muller', 'life', 'was', 'so', 'interesting', 'how', 'rebellious', 'young', 'man', 'turned', 'life', 'completely', 'attending', 'bible', 'meeting', 'friend', 'Muller', 'was', 'so', 'moved', 'felt', 'Lord', 'calling', 'Once', 'Muller', 'answered', 'God', 'calling', 'God', 'answered', 'one', 'Muller', 'prayers', 'unbelievable', 'timing', 'was', 'truly', 'amazing', 'see', 'how', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'God', 'answered', 'prayers', 'be', 'food', 'orphanage', 'children', 'lifting', 'fog', 'so', 'Muller', 'could', 'stay', 'schedule.It', 'was', 'interesting', 'note', 'Muller', 'suffered', 'great', 'losses', 'life', 'yet', 'faith', 'never', 'waivered', 'lost', 'son', 'wife', 'second', 'wife', 'daughter', 'early', 'ages', 'addition', 'had', 'serious', 'health', 'problems', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Muller', 'prayed', 'individual', 'heelings', 'not', 'prayers', 'discussed', 'DVD', 'dealt', 'Muller', 'mission', 'God', 'were', 'answered.In', 'addition', '1-hour', 'documentary', 'two', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'DVD', 'Muller', 'Second', 'Look', '28', 'min', 'further', 'look', 'man', 'Muller', 'Children', '18', 'min', 'former', 'orphans', 'now', 'adults', 'speaking', 'time', 'orphanage.I', 'found', 'Muller', 'faith', 'be', 'truly', 'inspirational', 'recommend', 'DVD']",Robber of the Cruel Streets
1030172,A9QXVJYKCFPNH,B000K144OM,"Dave Y. ""nobody777""","[12, 12]","It seems that few of the people who have reviewed this film (on various sites) make note of the incredible contrast between what this man, George Muller, lived and witnessed the evidence of compared to what is preached and practiced in today's churches and Christian ministries.  Muller believed that anything which God has blessed and called into existence, He will also provide for - especially financially!  Muller never asked for money, never requested donations, never sent out mailers/newsletters identifying a need, never started a fund-raising campaign, never manipulated anyone to give money by sharing his own circumstances!  He chose, along with his wife, to trust only God and make their needs known only to Him.  As a result, every single one of their needs were met... often with abundance!Over the course of his life, Muller gave away over $400,000 of his own money and supported thousands of orphans (feeding them, housing them, educating them, teaching them the Gospel, and equipping them with a trade so they could achieve in life) and he traveled to city after city (over 200,000 miles throughout the course of his ministry) sharing the Gospel, giving away tens of thousands of Bibles, sharing his life and working for the good of others - all without asking for a cent!  Muller proved with his life, year after year, that God is well able to support His work.  What an amazing testimony!  This movie does a great job of introducing us to the man in a well organized documentary with dramatic sequences throughout.  It will make you want to read up and discover more about his life and the love for God that inspired him in everything!  Religious organizations (i.e. their leadership) sometimes found it hard to align themselves with his concept of faith, because it left them without tangible controls.  It required absolute faith in God and full sincerity of heart.  Muller stuck to his convictions and didn't get dragged down by potential conflicts.  He just happily went along trusting God.  Many people were drawn to him, no doubt because the light of God's love that shone so brightly through him.And what does this mean for many so-called ministries today?  Muller's life gives all of us something fantastic to consider.  Many believe themselves called to ""ministry"" yet they also often tangle themselves up with finances and get caught in the rut of begging for money to keep their so-called God-inspired organizations running...  They approach ""ministry"" as though it were some ""thing"" rather than what it truly is (biblically); loving and sacrificial service!  True ministry requires no money at all - only faith working through love in willing individuals who have been touched by God!  Where is the genuineness of faith in God who will supply all our needs according to His riches in glory and who is well able to support any work He calls into existence?  Perhaps it's no wonder we see so few miracles in our day...  for no one (or at least few) seems to trust God anymore;  If there is not money to finance a work, then we think such work is impossible - rather than stopping to even ask God for His blessing and trusting Him to provide if indeed He is the one who called it to be.  What if there was more of this kind of reliance upon God?  I'll just bet you we would see the same kind of incredible miracles that Muller (and others like him) experienced in his own life, not to mention the joy this man carried in his heart his entire life, even though he had his seasons of suffering.  He always had a smile on his face and to this day his work is a testimony to the faithfulness and love of God.Great movie/documentary/drama!

1030173,ANYDEWJQN2GBX,B000K144OM,"Deepak K. Singh ""DKS""","[28, 28]","This powerful program chronicles the inspiring life of Christian evangelist George Muller who was born in Germany in 1805 and as a young man lived a life of sin and debauchery. Hoping to turn his life around, his father sent him to the university to study divinity. At a prayer meeting, he found fulfillment in God. Muller believed that his mission was to rescue orphans from the streets of Bristol, England, by providing free housing and education. The costs were enormous for such a great work, in terms of today's money, over one hundred million pounds. But the most amazing thing about his life is that he trusted God for everything, and God always provided. Pastors wonder if they will have enough money to complete their church's building projects or finance their programs. George Muller didn't. Without pleas for public support and with no government funding, he eventually provided accommodations for thousands of orphaned children. The program alternates between dramatizations and documentary footage with a male narrator visiting various historic sites.The film provides an accurate portrayal of the life of this man of God and impresses upon viewers the power of prayer and the trials and tribulations of a life of faith. It presents a powerful testimony of what God can do through a person who lets God have His Way, challenging believers to walk by simply putting trust in God each day for their spiritual and material needs. Featuring beautiful on-location cinematography and lovely background music, this is an absorbing and inspirational biographical profile. The DVD extras include a bonus half-hour program on the life and legacy of Muller. This docu-drama won 2007 Crown Awards for Best Picture (Silver), Best Curriculum (Bronze) and Best Documentary over $50,000 (Silver). A worthy purchase for Christians, Churches, Schools and libraries the world over.",5,Get inspired by the prayerful life of George Muller!!!,1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,1876,"['powerful', 'program', 'inspiring', 'life', 'Christian', 'evangelist', 'George', 'Muller', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'Germany', '1805', 'young', 'man', 'lived', 'life', 'sin', 'debauchery', 'Hoping', 'turn', 'life', 'around', 'father', 'sent', 'university', 'study', 'divinity', 'prayer', 'meeting', 'found', 'fulfillment', 'God', 'Muller', 'believed', 'mission', 'was', 'rescue', 'orphans', 'streets', 'Bristol', 'England', 'providing', 'free', 'housing', 'education', 'costs', 'were', 'enormous', 'such', 'great', 'work', 'terms', 'today', 'money', 'one', 'hundred', 'million', 'pounds', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'life', 'trusted', 'God', 'everything', 'God', 'always', 'provided', 'Pastors', 'wonder', 'will', 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'complete', 'church', 'building', 'projects', 'finance', 'programs', 'George', 'Muller', 'did', ""n't"", 'pleas', 'public', 'support', 'government', 'funding', 'eventually', 'provided', 'accommodations', 'thousands', 'orphaned', 'children', 'program', 'dramatizations', 'documentary', 'footage', 'male', 'narrator', 'visiting', 'various', 'historic', 'sites.The', 'film', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'life', 'man', 'God', 'viewers', 'power', 'prayer', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'life', 'faith', 'powerful', 'testimony', 'what', 'God', 'can', 'do', 'person', 'who', 'God', 'have', 'Way', 'challenging', 'believers', 'walk', 'simply', 'putting', 'trust', 'God', 'day', 'spiritual', 'material', 'needs', 'Featuring', 'beautiful', 'on-location', 'cinematography', 'lovely', 'background', 'music', 'absorbing', 'inspirational', 'biographical', 'profile', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'bonus', 'half-hour', 'program', 'life', 'legacy', 'Muller', 'docu-drama', 'won', '2007', 'Crown', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Silver', 'Best', 'Curriculum', 'Bronze', 'Best', 'Documentary', '50,000', 'Silver', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'Christians', 'Churches', 'Schools', 'world']",Robber of the Cruel Streets
