Fer loses his teaching position in Buenos Aires, and he is trying to figure out how to be productive, and solvent, from that point on.  His wife, Liliana, keeps him directed, or at least tries to, while balancing a difficult relationship with their son Pedro and his family in Spain.I found Fer to be pompous, wedded to a leftist philosophy that no longer has relevance, and just not very likable.  His son left the country because he realized how autocratic and arbitrary life could be with the political problems that seem to plague Argentina . . . continually.  His father seemed to go out of his way to berate his son for leaving his home country, but could offer no alternative.This movie drives one to evaluate one's own life, and what is most important.",4,"This movie drives one to evaluate one's own life, and what is most important.",1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,807,"['was', 'good', 'movie', 'depth', 'Fer', 'teaching', 'position', 'Buenos', 'Aires', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'be', 'productive', 'solvent', 'point', 'wife', 'Liliana', 'directed', 'least', 'tries', 'balancing', 'difficult', 'relationship', 'son', 'Pedro', 'family', 'Spain.I', 'found', 'Fer', 'be', 'pompous', 'wedded', 'leftist', 'philosophy', 'longer', 'relevance', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'likable', 'son', 'left', 'country', 'realized', 'how', 'autocratic', 'arbitrary', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'political', 'problems', 'seem', 'plague', 'Argentina', 'continually', 'father', 'seemed', 'go', 'way', 'berate', 'son', 'leaving', 'home', 'country', 'could', 'offer', 'alternative.This', 'movie', 'one', 'evaluate', 'one', 'own', 'life', 'what', 'most', 'important']",N/A

It is also peppered with presumptuous ranting and gratuitous, artificial dialogue, much in Aristarain's style. The actors make a very professional effort in trying to put some life in the starchy script and slow plot, but not even the skill of Luppi can prevent the movie from stopping dead when his character is forced give speeches on every utterance.A waste of acting talent, Spanish money and my time.",1,Good acting not enough,1149120000,"06 1, 2006",2006,468,"['most', 'Aristarain', 'films', 'one', 'nowhere', 'plot-wise', 'also', 'peppered', 'presumptuous', 'ranting', 'gratuitous', 'artificial', 'dialogue', 'much', 'Aristarain', 'style', 'actors', 'make', 'very', 'professional', 'effort', 'trying', 'put', 'life', 'starchy', 'script', 'slow', 'plot', 'not', 'even', 'skill', 'Luppi', 'can', 'prevent', 'movie', 'stopping', 'dead', 'when', 'character', 'forced', 'give', 'speeches', 'utterance.A', 'waste', 'acting', 'talent', 'Spanish', 'money', 'time']",N/A

Based on the novel by Lorenzo F. Aristarain and directed by Adolfo Aristarain this is a film of sunlight and shadows - and those clouds that promise to unveil the sun despite passing darkness.Fernando Robles (Federico Luppi) is a writer and university professor in Buenos Aires who is informed before his planned trip to Madrid to visit his son Pedro (Carlos Santamar&iacute;a) and daughter-in-law Natacha (Valentina Bassi) that he is being placed in early retirement: the crumbling government of Argentina cannot support such things as education!  After an exquisite farewell of sage advice to his students on what is important in the role of a teacher, he goes home to his loving wife of many years Liliana (Mercedes Sampietro) to prepare for their journey to Madrid.  At the airport Liliana senses sadness in Fernando and he confesses that he has been 'fired', that they have little money to live on in Buenos Aires: he covers his sadness by buying Liliana perfumes she loves.  This couple is bonded so beautifully it makes us weep.In Madrid the couple is forced to stay with the son and daughter but the closeness of this familial proximity is intolerable when Fernando informs his son of his financial situation.  Pedro is cold and harsh and is in life for money yet insists on assisting his parents. The couple leaves, returning to Argentina where they under advice from lawyer Carlos (Arturo Puig) sell their home and move to the country where they plan to grow lavender - a return to the purity of the land.  But fate intervenes and the story ends in a manner that leaves the viewer sad but wiser.The cast is sterling and the direction is first rate.  This is one of those films that should be required viewing for many reasons, but especially for people who are approaching the time of retirement and the fear that holds.  Highly recommended for a large viewing audience.  In Spanish with English subtitles.
