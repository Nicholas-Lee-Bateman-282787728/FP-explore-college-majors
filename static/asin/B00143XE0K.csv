1144960,A2YH3YTPSCAWF9,B00143XE0K,"Anthony Marinelli ""marilread""","[1, 2]","Frank Sinatra tried something unusual here and these types of sex comedies and therapies are interesting...but frank has a novel approach! Probably not his but maybe the screenwriter who may know his nature and has fun with it. We must imagine this as a fun movie,made for laughs,with his own money and production company. Hollywood was a tough town to make it in. Frank also had a hard time and during the 50's was told he was finished andleave town, but he wasnt thefirst. Not even dean martin had this happen to him,kicked out! But he said he never held any grudges,which others had. He was mostly at home with outsiders in hollywood,humphrey bogart james cagney and more innovative artists,but they were more well read and at this time opened up production companies,but he didnt get any jobs from them. But they actually warmed up to him and became a circle of friends with these enterprising artists. However this did him little good but he did get a break with harry cohn working almost for free with from here to eternity,which helped him in hollywood. However he aften made films like rat pack movies,and like this movie,which no one really knew what to make of? This movie was poorly received and reviewed and largely failed. Philip roth had written a successful novel Portnoy's complaint which was made into a film,and jerry lewis would make a kind of psychologist film(1966)three on a couch...which his old studio wouldnt allow him to make. These kinds of storieswere not well accepted at the time,and woody allen would make a series of thesefilms in new york,they all have a psychoanalytic frame at diagnosing andalleviating problems,and for that reason people have problems with thesefilm makers, as being kind of foreign,and if we look closely this film does thesame,but its all a send up and a joke. For the first 40 minutes, where frank'swife leaves him among best friend/swinger dino there are a flurry of psychoanalytic potshots and jokes at characters,which are all in jest,and whetherfrank understood them is up for debate, but they do take an approach atswinging america at the time,typified by dean martin and california! The girlsare also the kind of girls who would later follow him on his tv show, much likehis secretary where his jokes. And he makes no attempt to act. As a matter offact in 1963 he announced to the chagrin of hollywood he would continue to make movies but not act which many found disrespectful,but this nonsense startedwith some critics of Toys in the attic. They hit a sore nerve. Anyways frank divorces and the children are shattered,and lost and frank's character showsremorse at the children but his wife wants to move on with others,and toresolve this problem they move to mexico,and mexican culture,and the wife doesnt seem to care but he carries burdens,becomes ill, disease(or a play onwords dis-ease)with life. That's the metaphor,sick of his wife. She eventuallymarried his best friend,they divorce,many shenanigans,and dino at movie's endhates his wife,his character,but frank has shown remorse and has internalizedmany experiences from somewhere and developed a love for the three children,which dedicated him to the marriage,the family frictions,wife,husband,kids,all live happily ever after and its his culture which provides thishealing? Which culture? Cesar romero and the spanish visit,among the partiesand fun,and experience of family life,which is what the character is reallyabout,his life is made whole. A bit simplistic order from chaos,but reallyfrank sinatra,and this is a joke with a look inside at frank sinatra,theyare having fun,frank was always a latin person in all ways,his relationwith woman,loyalty to first wife,looking after the children(who appear inthis film) and in friends and associates. He liked the people from his oldneighbourhood(and there's a film he made of his life by his daughter whichgoes into it)...but for him a search inward is his culture to resolveproblems. This is done as a sendup,but the writer has fun with it in this way,as Spanish and American life are contrasted. This is a party film withold stalward cesar Romero and a host of european actors thrown in. Frank isalways a latin person,most comfortable there,and this kind of joke-film he woulddo again in dirty dingus magee. There are shots here at the dino character,who cant reform the way the more cultural character frank plays,as he findssalvation among the ancient cultures of the south! It's a joke but interestinglook at life,in my youth the most often repeated Sinatra film shown,a funsend up. Some people are sensitive to these kinds of films,the lewis film,and the woody allen films. The los angeles times reviewer found it a movie ofthe Sinatra clan...these kinds of comments are not acceptable by reviewersi find it a legitemate artistic expression,and he always admitted he doesnot write his movies. These were a kind of film,so its good to look at them...he does do a send up of jackie gleason though...but frank's idea is findingvalue and healingin family relationships,which the children bring about..now how did the writer come up with that...from someone who grew up on theSinatra music and music like many others!",4,four for the unusual...and something different,1332633600,"03 25,

While in Mexico, they accidentally get divorced and then she accidentally marries her husband's best pal (Dean Martin).  Hilarity ensues (NOT).This terrible sixties comedy completely wastes the talents of Sinatra and Kerr who appear painfully self-conscious and wooden (especially when dancing the frug in formal attire at a go-go club!), and the script is just ridiculous.  Who's going to believe Frank Sinatra as a boring fuddy-duddy?  Or a thirty-something (when he was really 50)?  Deborah Kerr is way too prim and proper to be a with-it swinger, and she's definitely not funny.  Martin plays his usual laid-back playboy, but really serves no purpose and seems to have wandered in from some other film set.
