118971,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,0790748452,Hikari,"[1, 1]","3.5 stars. This ""mockumentary"" in the style of ""This is Spinal Tap"" and ""Waiting for Guffman"" follows the travails of Crawford Mackenzie, aspiring hairdresser to the stars, as he leaves his home in Glasgow accompanied by a BBC film crew to represent Scotland in the Platinum Scissors competition in L.A. Only after his arrival (and running up a gigantic hotel tab) does Crawford discover that he misunderstood and has only been invited (at his own expense) to sit in the audience.  Crawford is both hurt and outraged at this lapse in hospitality, because as the reigning hair diva in Glasgow and all the surrounding bouroughs, he obviously deserves a berth in the competition.  What follows is a small picaresque gem of absurdity as Crawford pulls out all his Scottish ingenuity to get into the contest, even if it means reminding Sir Sean Connery (unofficial ambassador/patron saint to fellow Scotsmen everywhere) of an unfortunate toupee incident where Crawford was on hand to save the day.  When that tack fails, he stalks Sir Sean's American agent, Candy (an hilariously effective Frances Fisher) until she agrees to do some string-pulling, and takes this big, gentle naif under her overprocessed wing.  Craig Ferguson is alternately goofy, gangly, dignified and tender as our intrepid hairstylist, and wastes no opportunity to pull out his patented Sean Connery impression in support of Crawford's cause. The scene of Craig gamboling in his underwear in his swanky hotel suite to the strains of ""California Dreamin'"" is worth the price of admission alone. Other supporting players create memorable turns, most notably David Rasche as ""Stig"", Crawford's idol/nemesis who somehow manages to upstage Ferguson for flamboyance in every scene in which he appears. In a nod to the similarly-""fish out of water"" themed ""Pretty Woman"", Larry Miller reprises his unctuous store manager's role as the unctuous hotel manager who evicts Crawford after his credit card is maxed out.  Mary McCormack has a substantial role as the unbending event chairperson who ultimately relents and lets Crawford unsheathe his scissors.  (McCormack would later immortalize her bond with Craig by gifting him the infamous ""Snake Mug"" that he drinks out of every night in his current gig on CBS.) This little movie is quite slight, its charms mostly carried on the tartan-covered shoulders of Ferguson, but it's a  must-see for Craig fans.  All others are guaranteed not to ""get it"".  This movie appears to be currently unavailable for purchase new; perhaps they are planning a deluxe re-release set of all of Craig's movies, now that he is an American, a Peabody Award winner and hot stuff as ""David Letterman's Conan.""  This film may not be the most representative of Craig's inexhaustible talents, but it does demonstrate that he can do more than just host a talk show with a skeleton robot.

118973,A1L43KWWR05PCS,0790748452,Lawyeraau,"[39, 41]","This creative film within a film, a mock documentary, is simply delightful. Funny and original, it is a biting satire on the Beverly Hills/Hollywood power circuit. In the process, it tells the wonderful story of Crawford MacKenzie, a popular and talented gay hairdresser from Glasgow, Scotland, who believes himself to be invited to represent Scotland in a prestigious hairdressing competition, the Platinum Scissors, to be held in Los Angeles, California. When he arrives, complete with a BBC film crew filming his every move as part of a feature documentary they are making of Crawford's participation in the competition, Crawford discovers that he misread the letter. He is strictly to be a member of the audience and is told so in no uncertain terms by the patronizing director of the competition, who has sized up Crawford as a nobody.This does not deter Crawford from trying to be allowed to compete, as he definitely is not the kind of person who takes no for an answer. Crawford, charmingly played by the ever talented Craig Ferguson, pulls every trick in the book and ingratiates himself with Sean Connery's publicist, wonderfully played by Frances Fisher, who manages to open some doors for him. Along the way, he is snubbed by some Beverly Hills/Hollywood power types, including one of the competitors, an obnoxious Norwegian named Stig, who was the prior year's Platinum Scissors champion, played to perfection by David Rashe.Still, the ever nice Crawford remains undaunted, and what he does to get into the competition is funny, especially when he starts fighting fire with fire. In a short time, Crawford becomes a force with whom to be reckoned, and he finally gets his dearest wish and is allowed to compete. The competition itself is hysterical and will amaze and delight the viewer. This little known film is an absolute gem. Craig Ferguson's performance makes the character of Crawford MacKenzie totally endearing, and the supporting cast is, likewise, terrific. There are also a number of marvelous cameos, including Drew Carey playing himself.

The other is the likewise little known BLOW DRY.  BLOW DRY is a little more accessible as it has a more in depth plot line and characters.

Once there, he finds out he's only invited to be in the audience, and the competition's officious chairperson (a delightful Mary McCormack) refuses to let him enter.  Mackenzie stumbles onto Sean Connery's agent, played very nicely by Frances Fisher, and one thing leads to another and kaboom, Mackenzie finds an ally.
