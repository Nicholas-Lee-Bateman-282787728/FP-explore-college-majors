Not too much is talked about what the investigators had uncovered in the aftermath. It doesn't even tell the audience that the fired coach of University of Maryland (UMD) told his players to cover up the crime scene by taking the drugs away. There is a report that he knew all about Len Bias' cocaine problem and didn't do anything about it. Also, missing is the information that Len Bias was a habitual cocaine sniffer. Neither is the report that Len Bias was cheating and failing in school and was far below in the totem pole in terms of academic eligibility. Nor the piece tries to show the rampant drug use, especially cocaine and steroid, among athletes, including the UMD athletes, at a larger scale during the 80's. There isn't a lot of reaction towards the people who were primarily involved, and if there is any acrimony amongst them. There isn't anything in the piece about the rampant NCAA violations that were going on during the 80's which still exist to this day. All in all, ESPN Films 30 for 30: Without Bias is very biased, one-dimensional picture.",1,"A One-Dimensional, Biased Piece.",1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2013,1228,"['Viewed', '3/13Rate', '1/53/13', 'ESPN', 'Films', '30', '30', 'Without', 'Bias', 'ironical', 'title', 'been', 'one-sided', 'presentation', 'story', 'surrounding', 'Len', 'Bias', 'Not', 'too', 'much', 'talked', 'what', 'investigators', 'had', 'uncovered', 'aftermath', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'audience', 'fired', 'coach', 'University', 'Maryland', 'UMD', 'told', 'players', 'cover', 'up', 'crime', 'scene', 'taking', 'drugs', 'away', 'report', 'knew', 'Len', 'Bias', 'cocaine', 'problem', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'Also', 'missing', 'information', 'Len', 'Bias', 'was', 'habitual', 'cocaine', 'sniffer', 'report', 'Len', 'Bias', 'was', 'cheating', 'failing', 'school', 'was', 'far', 'totem', 'pole', 'terms', 'academic', 'eligibility', 'piece', 'show', 'rampant', 'drug', 'use', 'especially', 'cocaine', 'steroid', 'athletes', 'including', 'UMD', 'athletes', 'larger', 'scale', '80', ""n't"", 'lot', 'reaction', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'primarily', 'involved', 'acrimony', 'amongst', ""n't"", 'anything', 'piece', 'rampant', 'NCAA', 'violations', 'were', 'going', '80', 'still', 'exist', 'day', 'ESPN', 'Films', '30', '30', 'Without', 'Bias', 'very', 'biased', 'one-dimensional', 'picture']",ESPN Films 30 for 30: Without Bias

Georgetown, led by Patrick Ewing, went to three final fours and won it all in 1984.  The University of the District of Columbia ruled the basketball world in Division II in 1982 and 1983 behind Earl Jones and Michael Britt.  Howard University was very competitive behind the ""Dunk Patrol"" teams led by Larry Spriggs and James Ratiff.  Even the 1983 North Carolina State championship team was led by three players from the Washington area -- DeMatha teammates Sidney Lowe and Dereck Whittenburg and Thurl Bailey from Bladensburg.But many (including myself) will tell you that the best player in the area at that time played at the University of Maryland -- Len Bias. Never was Lefty Driesell closer to making Maryland his ""UCLA of the East"" then his teams in the early 80's.  It was great to see the local talent Bias go from raw talent in high school to powerful superstar in the ACC.As Michael Wilbon says in the documentary, many people remember where they were when Len Bias died.  For those like me who are from the DC area, this is a tough documentary to watch, but it must be watched.  Director Kirk Fraser does a magnificent job of telling this story in such a way that it can be handed down from generation to generation.  There is a true lesson in this story and younger people should see this great documentary.",5,A Great Documentary That's Tough For Those Who Were There!,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,1417,"['early', '1980', 'one', 'true', 'meccas', 'college', 'basketball', 'was', 'Washington', 'DC', 'area', 'Georgetown', 'led', 'Patrick', 'Ewing', 'went', 'three', 'final', 'fours', 'won', '1984', 'University', 'District', 'Columbia', 'ruled', 'basketball', 'world', 'Division', 'II', '1982', '1983', 'Earl', 'Jones', 'Michael', 'Britt', 'Howard', 'University', 'was', 'very', 'competitive', 'Dunk', 'Patrol', 'teams', 'led', 'Larry', 'Spriggs', 'James', 'Ratiff', 'Even', '1983', 'North', 'Carolina', 'State', 'championship', 'team', 'was', 'led', 'three', 'players', 'Washington', 'area', 'DeMatha', 'Sidney', 'Lowe', 'Dereck', 'Whittenburg', 'Thurl', 'Bailey', 'Bladensburg.But', 'many', 'including', 'will', 'tell', 'best', 'player', 'area', 'time', 'played', 'University', 'Maryland', 'Len', 'Bias', 'Never', 'was', 'Lefty', 'Driesell', 'closer', 'making', 'Maryland', 'UCLA', 'East', 'then', 'teams', 'early', '80', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'local', 'talent', 'Bias', 'go', 'raw', 'talent', 'high', 'school', 'powerful', 'superstar', 'ACC.As', 'Michael', 'Wilbon', 'documentary', 'many', 'people', 'remember', 'where', 'were', 'when', 'Len', 'Bias', 'died', 'who', 'are', 'DC', 'area', 'tough', 'documentary', 'watch', 'must', 'be', 'watched', 'Director', 'Kirk', 'Fraser', 'magnificent', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'such', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'handed', 'down', 'generation', 'generation', 'true', 'lesson', 'story', 'younger', 'people', 'should', 'see', 'great', 'documentary']",ESPN Films 30 for 30: Without Bias

Leonard Kevin Bias was a hoop phenomenon matched in his tragedy only by that of Eric 'Hank' Gathers.  When I think of how the arc of play in the NBA would have changed with these two...I can only say, 'dang...'  Len was a force and I, for one, feel that we would not think of Michael Jordan, the way we do, if fate had dealt Len's hand differently.Boston would have competed for at least 3-5 more championships with Len.  Both Bird and McHale would not have had to play the extended minutes they did, and there would have also been tougher matchups for LA, Detroit and Chicago with him in their rotation.As far as championships go...LA probably wouldn't have won back to back in 1987-88, Detroit either in 1989-90.  And Chicago would not have won 3 in a row in 1991-93.  That's a lot of history to have had an effect on, but Len was just that good.Magic, Isiah and Jordan should all place a dozen red roses on his grave every June 19th, just out of respect.",5,"Oh, what if...",1270512000,"04 6, 2010",2010,1107,"['too', 'young', 'remember', 'blinded', 'corporate', 'light', ""'Airness"", 'documentary', 'sad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Leonard', 'Kevin', 'Bias', 'was', 'hoop', 'phenomenon', 'matched', 'tragedy', 'only', 'Eric', ""'Hank"", 'Gathers', 'When', 'think', 'how', 'arc', 'play', 'NBA', 'would', 'have', 'changed', 'two', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'Len', 'was', 'force', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'think', 'Michael', 'Jordan', 'way', 'do', 'fate', 'had', 'dealt', 'Len', 'hand', 'differently.Boston', 'would', 'have', 'competed', 'least', '3-5', 'more', 'championships', 'Len', 'Bird', 'McHale', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'play', 'extended', 'minutes', 'did', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'tougher', 'matchups', 'LA', 'Detroit', 'Chicago', 'rotation.As', 'far', 'championships', 'go', 'LA', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'won', 'back', 'back', '1987-88', 'Detroit', '1989-90', 'Chicago', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'won', '3', 'row', '1991-93', 'lot', 'history', 'have', 'had', 'effect', 'Len', 'was', 'just', 'good.Magic', 'Isiah', 'Jordan', 'should', 'place', 'dozen', 'red', 'roses', 'grave', 'June', '19th', 'just', 'respect']",ESPN Films 30 for 30: Without Bias

That is totally true, and I remember exactly where I was: at my student job on campus.  When one of my colleagues came into work and told us the news, you could have knocked us over with a feather.  When the news came out about his drug use, we couldn't have been more shocked.  This was a man destined for greatness, who had superstar status but was simply a nice guy who loved his family, friends and basketball.  I loved the footage of all of his skills, and the many interviews with not only his family and friends, but journalists, sportscasters and news anchors that covered the story.
