He remembers the incident when his wife was killed in a cross fire with Redfoot, who has now come to the same prison. There are scenes of 2 rival gangs dealing drugs, Cain's son is one of them and he ends up in the same prison. Cain's son doesn't want anything to do with his father who is now participating in a mentoring program for would-be criminals.The movie is preachy, but the message is weak. Ving Rhames wasn't given an opportunity to display his full acting talents. Robert Patrick made a terrible warden.
