Hop over to you-tube and look up the 1987 trailer for this film. If you find the trailer to be gut-busting funny then you will probably love the movie. Beatty and Hoffman work hard but in many ways their efforts serve only to highlight the catastrophically weak and unfunny script. I see many positive reviews for this movie and I genuinely think they have to be fake. By comparison ""Jewel of the Nile"", ""Sahara"" and ""Spies Like Us"" are comedic gems. Oh sorry, was ""Sahara"" not meant to be a comedy? When I watched this movie at the cinema back in 87 it was actually booed during the closing credits by the audience. On leaving the movie house I was struck by a woman who was in tears; I suspect it may have been Elaine May. Fortunately this film ended no-one's career and May went on to do ""Primary Colors"" which is a much superior effort.",1,Yes I did Ishtar and I'm still in therapy,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,952,"['was', 'lured', 'film', 'one', 'funny', 'shot', 'entire', 'movie', 'scene', 'vultures', 'advice', 'Hop', 'you-tube', 'look', 'up', '1987', 'trailer', 'film', 'find', 'trailer', 'be', 'gut-busting', 'funny', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'movie', 'Beatty', 'Hoffman', 'work', 'hard', 'many', 'ways', 'efforts', 'serve', 'only', 'highlight', 'catastrophically', 'weak', 'unfunny', 'script', 'see', 'many', 'positive', 'reviews', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'think', 'have', 'be', 'fake', 'comparison', 'Jewel', 'Nile', 'Sahara', 'Spies', 'Us', 'are', 'comedic', 'gems', 'Oh', 'sorry', 'was', 'Sahara', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'comedy', 'When', 'watched', 'movie', 'cinema', 'back', '87', 'was', 'actually', 'booed', 'closing', 'credits', 'audience', 'leaving', 'movie', 'house', 'was', 'struck', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'tears', 'suspect', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Elaine', 'May', 'Fortunately', 'film', 'ended', 'no-one', 'career', 'May', 'went', 'do', 'Primary', 'Colors', 'much', 'superior', 'effort']",Ishtar VHS

At the very least this film is an interesting story with great performances from the two leads.  My wife feels the reason the film gets a bad rap is because the middle of the film has some fat that needed to be trimmed and nearly fell asleep.  Aside from that, she loved the film and I must say that I find it enjoyable as well.  At the time everyone thought it odd that Beatty and Hoffman should play failed singer/songwriters who take a bad gig just to not be complete professional failures.  These two ooze charisma most of the time and audiences just couldn't jive with actors playing not only against type, but playing against likability for the most part.  For this reason people think the movie is a collosal and pathetic misfire.  I think the film stands alone and is an interesting story with great performances it just doesn't pander at all to expectations.  I find it heartwarming and fun.  It's funny in a way that I'd never experienced before and may never again.  Give the film a chance and at the very least you'll be able to say the film is unique just don't go in expecting to see the typical all-american success story.

I went and saw it at a theater when it was originally released. I was a fan of both Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty at that time, and I am even today. I kept watching this movie and thinking this movie has to get better. These stars are great, there's no way they would perform in a movie without a real story. But they continued to try and wing it and sing along throughout this movie. Have you ever heard these guys sing? Let's just say don't rush out and buy any CDs if they ever made one. Now I have seen comedies were someone can't sing and it is obvious that is part of the comedy. This however just wasn't funny when they sang. So give me any of Mel Brooks, or any other comedy movie, but don't give me Ishtar. Bottom line. If you like it fine, I didn't get their jokes. Perhaps you get it and I don't, perhaps thousands of others like me didn't get it. But when thousands of people did see it and they say it wasn't any good, don't try to say only a few really saw it and know if it is any good. Many people saw it based on the stars Beatty and Hoffman, and many people said it was one of their least favorites. If more felt it didn't flop it would have made the money they poured into it back. As it stands it was a total dud. I don't make the statistics up, the bean counters can give you the facts on this one. So you handful of fans are lucky to have this on DVD. I should be so lucky to have a classic like ""African Queen"" on DVD instead of you having this one.  On Blu-ray?  You have to be kidding me.

Alot of people thought I was out of my mind when I said this was a good movie. I didn't say it was the best, but it definitely was better than what everyone thought of it when it came out in 1987. I was so much following the crowd that I didn't watch this until 1990. It's about a pair of no-talent songwriters who just lost their girlfriends, and are sent to the Middle East by their agent to peddle their songs there, but along the way they get caught up in a political snafu, and all of a sudden they are the key to political life and death not only to the country they're in trying to sell their songs, but their own country the United States. The only thing they ask for in order to restore order is that they be allowed to record a live album of their songs, and all I can say is ""Wow...what power"". The songs are probably the worst ever used in a movie, and yet they are so funny sounding that you just can't help but give a little laugh. Give the movie a chance huh?

An obvious mistake, in retrospect, but one can't patronize every movie ever made; one must seek advice, a filter, somewhere. I remember like it was yesterday that parent corporation SONY had to write off $3.2 billion in losses for its Columbia Pictures division in the wake of this and a few other box office duds. Box office dud--how did that happen? I can only theorize that ""it didn't play in Peoria,"" i.e. ""Middle America"" didn't ""get"" the long setup of the boys' travails as wannabe Brill Building superstars prior to their arrival on the burning sands of northern Africa. The political intrigues that unfold there are much easier to relate to now, in the wake of various US military adventures overseas since 1987. Indeed, had I seen this film when it was released I would have been befuddled by its reference to ""Shia"" Muslims. Good ol' Chuck Grodin is excellent as straight-man CIA operative. As the decades passed, I developed a hankering to see this movie, if only out of morbid curiosity, but there was no option to do so. After this Blu-ray was released, I checked Netflix again and again and found it not available to rent.

Neither as bad as snobbish, know-all critics of the time had us believe, nor as great as the extremely talented Warren Beatty evidently thought it would be, Ishtar is still an enjoyable movie.Described at the time as a ""vanity production"" which lost $40 million, Ishtar apparently previewed well, and was number one on its opening weekend, only to be beaten by a b-grade horror movie called The Gate. Stories of rampant egotism, ""creative differences"", and grandscale self-indulgence filled the movie press, and Ishtar ended 1987 as the number one turkey.Watching it today, free from any need to justify its existence, Ishtar has its moments - how could it not, with stars like Warren Beatty, Dustin Hoffman and director Elaine May? It deserves credit for trying something different (a romantic comedy with a political subtext, touching on themes of oil and power). I have a soft spot for the film, but would be the first to admit that this isn't Beatty's finest hour - for that, check out Reds, which is a masterpiece.

Here are some sample lyrics:Telling the truth can be dangerous business;Honest and popular don't go hand in hand.If you admit that you play the accordion,No one will hire you in a rock 'n' roll band.But we can sing out hearts out.And if we're lucky, then no neighbors complain.Because life is the way we audition for God;Let us pray that we all get the job.Every time Beatty and Hoffman struggle through singing their songs, or even better, trying to compose their songs, finding the proper inane lyric to match the insipid music, you have to laugh, chuckle, or at least wince in pain.

337444,A27JJILLBKWIR9,6302814146,"Megarat ""a well-intended critic""","[4, 4]","I have to admit, I use this movie as a sort of Litmus test.A Litmus test for what, however, I'm not sure exactly.  Independence of thought?  The self-confidence to admit that they enjoy something that has been institutionalized as the platonic ideal of the Bad Movie?  A goofy sense of humor?  A light-hearded joie de vivre?  You tell me.  All I know is that if someone admits to liking this movie, I almost always find them to be pleasant company.Personally, I have loved this movie, unconditionally and unabashedly, ever since it came out, in spite of the social and media-provided pre-conditioning that encouraged the world to hate it sight-unseen, and I have always been baffled by the knee-jerk hatred expressed by most people, especially when they haven't seen it.  There isn't much that can perk up my mood faster than this movie can.  Sure, it hasn't held up as well as it could have since its release in 1987, thanks in large part due to the cheesy one-man-synthesizer-band score, but I still love it, and I'll be watching it at least once a year until the day I die.In part due to this Blu-Ray release.  I've had a bootleg copy of ""Ishtar"" on DVD for some time, as it was the only (non-VHS) format available.  Many thanks to that conscientious gent on the internet who, starting with the Italian DVD release, re-tooled it to have no region restrictions and, by default, the subtitles turned off.  That copy served me fine for years, but I was still happy to pick up this official Blu-Ray edition, just to support its release, and I couldn't be happier.The Blu-Ray format is sometimes a pain in the backside, and older (i.e., pre-digital) movies can get butchered during the transfer process, with DNR pancake faces and/or other artifacts caused by artificially increasing the contrast, or audio issues stemming from separating the (in ""Ishtar""'s case, mono) original soundtrack into 5.1 (or greater) surround sound.  But I'm happy to report that this release looks, sounds, and plays great, with (by my relatively snobbish eye) no glaring issues, including playability (on my BD player, at least).  I'm still keeping my bootleg DVD, as I regard DVD as  the more flexible and reliable format, but still, any sanctioned release of this movie in a modern home-video format is an event worth celebrating for us few and proud Ishtarians.The only complaint I can make is that this BD release contains no extras.  And I mean that literally:  no extras at all, not even a printed insert with a chapter index.  I know, in this world, economics prevails, and for a movie with such a limited cult status and a glaringly red balance sheet, the cost of producing anything other than a bare-bones movie-only release likely wouldn't be justified, but I can still fantasize about a time when this movie has achieved a greater appreciation, and a proper deluxe edition can see the light of day.  This movie is just screaming for interviews and commentary from the director and lead actors, perhaps a documentary about the controversy that all but eternally vanquished this movie into Hollywood's Third Circle of Hell, and you know there has to be hours of terrific outtakes locked away in a vault somewhere.So let's hope (and lobby) for that long-odds possibility of a proper treatment from Criterion or equivalent, but in the meanwhile, this no-frills release is very easy to get happy about.",5,Ishtar on Blu-Ray:  oh happy day,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,3386,"['have', 'admit', 'use', 'movie', 'sort', 'Litmus', 'test.A', 'Litmus', 'test', 'what', 'however', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'Independence', 'thought', 'self-confidence', 'admit', 'enjoy', 'something', 'been', 'institutionalized', 'platonic', 'ideal', 'Bad', 'Movie', 'A', 'goofy', 'sense', 'humor', 'light-hearded', 'joie', 'vivre', 'tell', 'know', 'someone', 'liking', 'movie', 'almost', 'always', 'find', 'be', 'pleasant', 'company.Personally', 'have', 'loved', 'movie', 'unconditionally', 'unabashedly', 'ever', 'came', 'out', 'spite', 'social', 'media-provided', 'pre-conditioning', 'encouraged', 'world', 'hate', 'sight-unseen', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'baffled', 'knee-jerk', 'hatred', 'expressed', 'most', 'people', 'especially', 'when', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""n't"", 'much', 'can', 'perk', 'up', 'mood', 'faster', 'movie', 'can', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'held', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'release', '1987', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'due', 'cheesy', 'one-man-synthesizer-band', 'score', 'still', 'love', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'year', 'day', 'die.In', 'part', 'due', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', ""'ve"", 'had', 'bootleg', 'copy', 'Ishtar', 'DVD', 'time', 'was', 'only', 'non-VHS', 'format', 'available', 'Many', 'thanks', 'conscientious', 'gent', 'internet', 'who', 'starting', 'Italian', 'DVD', 'release', 're-tooled', 'have', 'region', 'restrictions', 'default', 'subtitles', 'turned', 'off', 'copy', 'served', 'fine', 'years', 'was', 'still', 'happy', 'pick', 'up', 'official', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'just', 'support', 'release', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'happier.The', 'Blu-Ray', 'format', 'sometimes', 'pain', 'backside', 'older', 'i.e.', 'pre-digital', 'movies', 'can', 'get', 'butchered', 'transfer', 'process', 'DNR', 'pancake', 'and/or', 'other', 'artifacts', 'caused', 'artificially', 'increasing', 'contrast', 'audio', 'issues', 'stemming', 'separating', 'Ishtar', 'case', 'mono', 'original', 'soundtrack', '5.1', 'greater', 'surround', 'sound', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'release', 'great', 'relatively', 'snobbish', 'eye', 'glaring', 'issues', 'including', 'playability', 'BD', 'player', 'least', ""'m"", 'still', 'keeping', 'bootleg', 'DVD', 'regard', 'DVD', 'more', 'flexible', 'reliable', 'format', 'still', 'sanctioned', 'release', 'movie', 'modern', 'home-video', 'format', 'event', 'worth', 'celebrating', 'few', 'proud', 'Ishtarians.The', 'only', 'complaint', 'can', 'make', 'BD', 'release', 'extras', 'mean', 'literally', 'extras', 'not', 'even', 'printed', 'insert', 'chapter', 'index', 'know', 'world', 'economics', 'prevails', 'movie', 'limited', 'cult', 'status', 'glaringly', 'red', 'balance', 'sheet', 'cost', 'producing', 'anything', 'other', 'bare-bones', 'movie-only', 'release', 'likely', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'justified', 'can', 'still', 'fantasize', 'time', 'when', 'movie', 'achieved', 'greater', 'appreciation', 'proper', 'deluxe', 'edition', 'can', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'movie', 'just', 'screaming', 'interviews', 'commentary', 'director', 'lead', 'actors', 'perhaps', 'documentary', 'controversy', 'eternally', 'vanquished', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'Third', 'Circle', 'Hell', 'know', 'there', 'be', 'hours', 'terrific', 'outtakes', 'locked', 'away', 'vault', 'somewhere.So', 'let', 'hope', 'lobby', 'long-odds', 'possibility', 'proper', 'treatment', 'Criterion', 'equivalent', 'meanwhile', 'no-frills', 'release', 'very', 'easy', 'get', 'happy']",Ishtar VHS

And people that enjoyed felt compelled to say they'd hated it.  The initial bad press snowballed into an avalanche.This many years later, the automatic conception of this movie as an unwatchable box office bomb has faded.  And it can be assessed more fairly, and on its merits. It is imperfect. It drags a bit in parts.  But when it's funny it's laugh out loud funny.  And there's enough of those moments to justify a 3 out of five star rating.It's the story of two dim Simon and Garfunkle wannabes (Hoffman/Beatty).  A lot of effort from a great songwriter went into making &#34;believably bad music&#34; for them.  And when they say they believe the crap they've written is on par with Paul Simon, you believe they believe it, and it's funny.  The plot itself is funny eough--how they manage to get sucked into a battle for power in a small, fictional, ME country.  But the movie is funniest when Hoffman and Beatty are onstage singing.",3,Ishtar Is Not Awful,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",2013,1073,"['When', 'was', 'released', 'Ishtar', 'opened', 'bad', 'reviews', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'liked', 'People', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'said', 'was', 'horrible', 'people', 'enjoyed', 'felt', 'compelled', 'say', ""'d"", 'hated', 'initial', 'bad', 'press', 'snowballed', 'avalanche.This', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'automatic', 'conception', 'movie', 'unwatchable', 'box', 'office', 'bomb', 'faded', 'can', 'be', 'assessed', 'more', 'fairly', 'merits', 'imperfect', 'bit', 'parts', 'when', 'funny', 'laugh', 'loud', 'funny', 'enough', 'moments', 'justify', '3', 'five', 'star', 'rating.It', 'story', 'two', 'dim', 'Simon', 'Garfunkle', 'wannabes', 'Hoffman/Beatty', 'lot', 'effort', 'great', 'songwriter', 'went', 'making', '34', 'believably', 'bad', 'music', '34', 'when', 'say', 'believe', 'crap', ""'ve"", 'written', 'par', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'believe', 'believe', 'funny', 'plot', 'funny', 'eough', 'how', 'manage', 'get', 'sucked', 'battle', 'power', 'small', 'fictional', 'ME', 'country', 'movie', 'funniest', 'when', 'Hoffman', 'Beatty', 'are', 'onstage', 'singing']",Ishtar VHS

Risoli ""black farmer""","[1, 3]","Although it can be excused as being mostly fantasy, I mean being made in 1987 and being ahead of its time, in defense, it does have some interesting things to say about our government's involvement in the Middle East, but it so blatantly unfunny as a comedy.  It rightfully should be an embarrassment to Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty, especially Mr. Beatty, who is so woefully out of sorts here, I am surprised he has survived it if well.  I think he was painfully too old for &#34;Shampoo&#34; and here when you'd expect him to turn on his obvious sexuality, they downplay that he has not any at all, which is like expecting a bushel basket to hide a bonfire.  Elaine May should be embarrassed too as the writer and director.  I must say, I don't know why she used a pseudonym on the screenplay for Otto Preminger's &#34;Such Good Friends&#34; as it was infinitely funnier than this bomb.  The singing duo, and their &#34;songs&#34; mostly credited partially to Paul Williams are so unbelievable bad and so unbelievable that they could give lasting credence to their choice of career for five minutes let alone a seeming lifetime shows the depth to the bottom this film exhibits for the talent involved.  Only Isabelle Adjani deserves credit for being able to cry so effectively as she typically can do and create a sympathetic character although otherwise false historically.  With photography by Vittorio Storaro, The Sony/Columbia blu-ray is good, with only previews as an extra.  Given its improbable release date, it becomes really a curiously stale and awful fantasy in a land of cliches.

Who would have thought this underrated ""flop"" would have beaten such great films to the blu-ray format as SPLASH and THE ABYSS, but here it is!  Though it is widely known this film was fraught with production disagreements, it hardly shows on the screen. You either love it or you hate it. Frankly I think a lot of people still just don't get it. Perhaps they're expecting bigger laughs and give up before catching on to the comedic rhythm. Ishtar too is a great comment on how one country's covert meddling in another nation's politics can backfire.
