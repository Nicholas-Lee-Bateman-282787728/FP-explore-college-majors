It does offer a nice variety of background scenery as Felix takes a trip to meet his father who he has never known, following the death of his mother. A funny thing happens on the way to Marseilles. Actually SEVERAL things, not all of them funny, but it definately has its moments. It seems that everyone who's paths cross with Felix' is drawn to him like ""stink on a skunk"" as we say in Oklahomo. These adventures include a steamy sexcapade with a driver who gives him a ride (in more ways than one), an elderly woman who takes him in to her home to keep him from sleeping on a park bench and taking the risk of being mugged, a woman with a van load of children who decides she wants to spend the night with him although he is gay, and her children who quickly refer to him as ""Uncle Felix"" on a road trip of their own enroute to their individual dad's homes for the weekend. The only people who don't seem to warm up to him are the men he witnesses killing another man, and his father of course who doesn't know Felix is his son. The two meet however and eventually have a relationship which satisfies Felix and gives him the sence that his journey was not in vain. In the process he solves a crime as the only witness. All in all, very good acting and a good cast. A nice gay road trip film, complete with comedy, drama, adventure, mystery and a little horror all rolled into one.",4,Sometimes a little trip can change everything!,1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,1497,"['Adventures', 'Felix', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'view', 'not', 'one', 'suspect', 'will', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'offer', 'nice', 'variety', 'background', 'scenery', 'Felix', 'trip', 'meet', 'father', 'who', 'never', 'known', 'following', 'death', 'mother', 'funny', 'thing', 'way', 'Marseilles', 'Actually', 'SEVERAL', 'things', 'not', 'funny', 'definately', 'moments', 'everyone', 'who', 'paths', 'cross', 'Felix', 'drawn', 'stink', 'skunk', 'say', 'Oklahomo', 'adventures', 'include', 'steamy', 'sexcapade', 'driver', 'who', 'ride', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'elderly', 'woman', 'who', 'home', 'keep', 'sleeping', 'park', 'bench', 'taking', 'risk', 'being', 'mugged', 'woman', 'van', 'load', 'children', 'who', 'spend', 'night', 'gay', 'children', 'who', 'quickly', 'refer', 'Uncle', 'Felix', 'road', 'trip', 'own', 'enroute', 'individual', 'dad', 'homes', 'weekend', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'warm', 'up', 'are', 'men', 'killing', 'man', 'father', 'course', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'Felix', 'son', 'two', 'meet', 'however', 'eventually', 'have', 'relationship', 'Felix', 'sence', 'journey', 'was', 'not', 'vain', 'process', 'crime', 'only', 'witness', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'cast', 'nice', 'gay', 'road', 'trip', 'film', 'complete', 'comedy', 'drama', 'adventure', 'mystery', 'little', 'horror', 'rolled', 'one']",Adventures of Felix

A relatively upbeat and cheerful movie, especially compared to other French films, which often try to be depressing on purpose. The gay protagonist does NOT die or have something else horrible happen to him (straight viewers may wonder why I am saying this, but just watch some of the older movies about gays, and you will know).Lush countryside, leisurely camera and convivial music set the tone. This movie has the best soundtrack I have heard in a long time. Yes, this is a movie you will want to watch again. No, the plot is not the major strength of the film. No, there are not compelling issues that must be resolved. No, this is not a cliffhanger or hard-hitting drama. Don't expect to get your emotions worked up. Nor is this an exercise in erotica. This is exactly what I said, an enjoyable romp through the French countryside, where our intrepid traveler has a series of minor adventures in his quest to meet his Father (or was it Mother, I forget, I saw this movie a year ago).I would consider placing this in the top twenty of all gay feature-length films. Give it a try and see what you think. But like I said, you need to have a relaxed attitude and approach this film for simple entertainment. Personally, I watched the movie out of curiosity to learn more about the French.

The movie unfortunately doesn't really ever go anywhere. In the beginning of the film Felix, who has just lost his job, decides that he will pack up, leave his caring teacher lover and go looking for his father. Along the way he meets a ""little brother"" type with whom he steals a car containing a young baby, a ""grandmother"" type, a hunky ""cousin"" who he has a brief romp with and finally a ""father"" figure. I must have blinked or something got lost in translation since all at once Felix apparently is no longer interested in finding his real father but had a reunion with his lover and they go off into the proverbial sunset.I even listened to the directors' commentary supplied on the DVD, something that is almost always fruitless since a director who has to spend 90 minutes explaining what he was trying to do is usually fighting a losing battle.

Enriquez ""Counselor and lover of life""","[29, 33]","This is a film about an orphan man hitching his way through France to meet his father for the first time.  In his journey he learns that families do not have to be biological to be of value.  The film is broken up in seven pieces: the introduction of the main character, a plot thread (murder!) to weave the film together, then a meeting of 5 people that becomes his family.  The ""grandmother"" and ""sister"" story lines are very well done.  They clearly illustrate the needs of these characters to make deep connections with each other and the brief events that tie them together.  Unfortunately, the other three encounters fail to do as well.  It is hard to imagine that the lead would actually keep in touch with the men he meets along the way.  The ""little brother"" story is cute and has many great monents, but the characters fail to connect in a lasting way.  The ""cousin"" vignette is simply gratuitous and nothing more (like too many American gay films).  The ""father"" section wraps up the film without really establishing any significant connection with the two men.  I am giving this film four stars because it is a nice film about discovery and family.  A welcome change from many of the other gay films out there.  Still I am left wishing for a remake that could demonstrate some real male bonding.

He goes on a road trip that lets us share his episodic journey to Marseilles.  Felix's significant other is Daniel played by Pierre-Loup Rajot, who looks like a French version of Mr. Clean with his baldhead and facial hair.  Felix decides he needs to meet his biological father and promises to meet Daniel when he gets to his journey.  Along his way, he has a number of different encounters with characters from a young boy.  (If my memory is correct, this was the character of Jules played by Charly Sergue.)  The boy is an artist who invites Felix to crash at his place.  A series of encounters occur including getting an underage Jules into a club & stealing a car.  All of this is approached as a lark that is carefree.  Jules decides he wants more action than Felix is willing to give; so Felix continues on his journey.  One of the most interesting encounters comes with an elderly woman Mathilde played by Patachou.  Patachou whose first film was in 1955, does a great job as the somewhat lonely but tolerant woman who enjoys Felix's company for as long as it lasts.  Felix meets a young mother Isabelle played by Ariane Ascaride who won the French Academy of Cinema Best Actress award in 1997 for ""Marius et Jeannette.""  As Felix arrives in Marseilles, he has a philosophical conversation with a fisherman played by Maurice Benichou.  Benichou does an excellent job, bringing an entire life before your eyes with a few brief scenes.  Probably the most sensational aspect of the film is Felix's encounter with the railroad man, described as ""cousin,"" played by Philippe Garziano.  Although there are several covers for the DVD, the one currently listed shows the guys taking off their shirts while flying a kite in the French countryside.  There is a flash of frontal nudity that results in a case of poison ivy ""where the sun don't shine.""  The French approach to this part of their lives is very matter-of-fact and shown without anxiety or sentimentality.  Directors Oliver Ducastel & Jacques Martineau have worked together on two subsequent films, ""My Life on Ice"" & ""Cockles & Muscles.""  The movie meanders through the French countryside, which is gorgeous.  I don't know if there is any great moral attached to this picture other than just to realize that life is passing; so enjoy each day.

Felix takes his pills and that's about it. ) who decides to take a trip to the south of France to see the father he's never met after being laid off. Meeting his father becomes irrelevant as he encounters an assorted bunch of characters that reveal more about Felix than he reveals about himself (my favorite was ""the grandmother"" who was a hoot). There is an incidental sexual encounter with ""the cousin"" (you'll understand when you see the movie--he's not really his cousin) but it's shown very flippantly as if it's just another part of the adventure (don't expect full on sex in this movie b/c you won't get it). The fact that Felix has a boyfriend doesn't seem to bother either of them.The movie is designed to expand the definition of family and it does so without the sap. Sami Bouajila is quite charming, incredibly SEXY and, as Felix, a little self-absorbed. The movie is not terrifically deep; it's a nice little story that has a nice, little ending.",4,A bit tedious but joyous nonetheless,1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,1361,"['Adventures', 'Felix', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'patient', 'pacing', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'slow', 'center', 'end', 'begin', 'pull', 'pieces', 'together', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'was', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'liked', 'it.We', 'follow', 'Felix', 'who', 'HIV+', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'not', 'one', 'movies', 'HIV', 'film', 'dealt', 'heavy-handedness', 'most', 'movies', 'do', 'Felix', 'pills', 'who', 'take', 'trip', 'south', 'France', 'see', 'father', 'never', 'met', 'being', 'laid', 'off', 'Meeting', 'father', 'irrelevant', 'assorted', 'bunch', 'characters', 'reveal', 'more', 'Felix', 'favorite', 'was', 'grandmother', 'who', 'was', 'hoot', 'incidental', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'cousin', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'when', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'cousin', 'shown', 'very', 'flippantly', 'just', 'part', 'adventure', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'full', 'sex', 'movie', 'b/c', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'fact', 'Felix', 'boyfriend', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bother', 'them.The', 'movie', 'designed', 'expand', 'definition', 'family', 'so', 'sap', 'Sami', 'Bouajila', 'quite', 'charming', 'incredibly', 'SEXY', 'Felix', 'little', 'self-absorbed', 'movie', 'not', 'terrifically', 'deep', 'nice', 'little', 'story', 'nice', 'little', 'ending']",Adventures of Felix
683147,A1ADZQOL0PLBEW,B00005U2FI,Scadhog,"[1, 1]","Charming, unpretentious comedy about a young man, Felix (Sami Bouajila), who decides on the spur of the moment to travel across France to meet the father he never knew.  As he journeys he encounters individuals whom he comes to view as members of his extended family (""little brother"", ""cousin"", ""grandmother"", and so forth).  Along the way he steals a car with a baby in it, takes an underage boy to a gay bar, has a romantic interlude with a handsome man, is coerced into helping an old lady rearrange her house, gets beaten up, and witnesses a murder.For the most part the humor is quiet and understated, although at times it is laugh-out-loud funny.  The best sequence is when Felix meets the saucy old woman who takes a more than motherly interest in him.The only real drawback to the film is that it drags in spots, particularly during the episode with his ""sister"", a young woman with three children who picks our hero up while he is hitchhiking.  Otherwise everything is just fine.  The photography is beautiful (how can the French countryside be anything but beautiful?), the writing is sharp, and the music is catchy.  Bouajila is an appealing Felix, bright-eyed and full of life, in spite of being HIV positive (a plot device which thankfully does not interfere with the humor of the film).  The rest of the cast is excellent, particularly the great singer/actress Patachou, who plays his ""grandmother"".All in all, a very enjoyable way to spend 90 minutes",4,Charming comedy,1314489600,"08 28, 2011",2011,1466,"['Charming', 'unpretentious', 'comedy', 'young', 'man', 'Felix', 'Sami', 'Bouajila', 'who', 'spur', 'moment', 'travel', 'France', 'meet', 'father', 'never', 'knew', 'individuals', 'whom', 'view', 'members', 'extended', 'family', 'little', 'brother', 'cousin', 'grandmother', 'so', 'forth', 'way', 'car', 'baby', 'underage', 'boy', 'gay', 'bar', 'romantic', 'interlude', 'handsome', 'man', 'coerced', 'helping', 'old', 'lady', 'rearrange', 'house', 'beaten', 'up', 'murder.For', 'most', 'part', 'humor', 'quiet', 'understated', 'times', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'best', 'sequence', 'when', 'Felix', 'saucy', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'more', 'motherly', 'interest', 'him.The', 'only', 'real', 'drawback', 'film', 'spots', 'particularly', 'episode', 'sister', 'young', 'woman', 'three', 'children', 'who', 'hero', 'up', 'hitchhiking', 'Otherwise', 'everything', 'just', 'fine', 'photography', 'beautiful', 'how', 'can', 'French', 'countryside', 'be', 'anything', 'beautiful', 'writing', 'sharp', 'music', 'catchy', 'Bouajila', 'appealing', 'Felix', 'bright-eyed', 'full', 'life', 'spite', 'being', 'HIV', 'positive', 'plot', 'device', 'thankfully', 'not', 'interfere', 'humor', 'film', 'rest', 'cast', 'excellent', 'particularly', 'great', 'singer/actress', 'Patachou', 'who', 'grandmother', '.All', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'spend', '90', 'minutes']",Adventures of Felix
