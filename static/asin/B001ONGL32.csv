I use the 20 and 30 minute workouts for now until I'm pain free from leg problems. Great workout for Jazzercise fans.,5,Jazzercise Live Total Body Workout,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,157,"['like', 'moves', 'music', 'dvd', 'use', '20', '30', 'minute', 'workouts', 'now', ""'m"", 'pain', 'free', 'leg', 'problems', 'Great', 'workout', 'Jazzercise', 'fans']",Jazzercise Live - Total Body Dance Workout
1222956,A3MX44NOGGPVS4,B001ONGL32,Nadine Cummington,"[0, 0]","This is my very first Jazzrecise DVD and I absolutely love it!!! I saw it while I was doing a search, and it was for a great price. Recently I decided that I needed to add something else to my workout routine since it was getting a bit boring for me. Jazzercise Live is perfect! The segments really get your heart pumping, and there is a low impact option. All of the workouts on this DVD are easy to follow, low impact on the joints (knees) and the music keeps things flowing smoothly and makes it even more fun. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a fun workout routine.",5,Jazzercise Live,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,589,"['very', 'first', 'Jazzrecise', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'love', 'saw', 'was', 'doing', 'search', 'was', 'great', 'price', 'Recently', 'decided', 'needed', 'add', 'something', 'else', 'workout', 'routine', 'was', 'getting', 'bit', 'boring', 'Jazzercise', 'Live', 'perfect', 'segments', 'really', 'get', 'heart', 'pumping', 'low', 'impact', 'option', 'workouts', 'DVD', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'low', 'impact', 'joints', 'knees', 'music', 'things', 'flowing', 'smoothly', 'even', 'more', 'fun', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'fun', 'workout', 'routine']",Jazzercise Live - Total Body Dance Workout
1222957,A2SO07HFYZWA5Z,B001ONGL32,S. Comiskey-Hill,"[3, 4]","For women that did the Jazzercise program before, this is probably a great disc. For someone who just wanted to try it - it was bad. 80's moves, hair, music... The main instructor was IRRITATING and awkward. The forum was ""live"" so it was hard to hear, and many of the camera shots were of the whole room of women exercising, instead of specific shots of the instructors. Her daughter takes over a lot and is a little less annoying, but still annoying.Sure you could get a workout using it regularly, but it got on my nerves after the first time. Never put it back on again. To a local charity it immediately went.",1,Oh My 80's...,1328227200,"02 3, 2012",2012,614,"['women', 'did', 'Jazzercise', 'program', 'before', 'probably', 'great', 'disc', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'try', 'was', 'bad', '80', 'moves', 'hair', 'music', 'main', 'instructor', 'was', 'IRRITATING', 'awkward', 'forum', 'was', 'live', 'was', 'hard', 'hear', 'many', 'camera', 'shots', 'were', 'whole', 'room', 'women', 'exercising', 'instead', 'specific', 'shots', 'instructors', 'daughter', 'over', 'lot', 'little', 'less', 'annoying', 'still', 'annoying.Sure', 'could', 'get', 'workout', 'using', 'regularly', 'got', 'nerves', 'first', 'time', 'Never', 'put', 'back', 'again', 'local', 'charity', 'immediately', 'went']",Jazzercise Live - Total Body Dance Workout

I, of course, follow the low impact, but the entire routine is great and I am swetting my _____ off. I need to lose about 60 pounds and I  now think I can do it. The reason I had to quite my Jazzercise Class was my work schedule. New hours knocked me out of the class and boy was I upset.Try the DVD.
