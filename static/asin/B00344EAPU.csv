1320725,A24PTVSZSM8968,B00344EAPU,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","I bought this movie because I am currently thinking about the issue of tenure on my job. I thought it might be interesting to see how Hollywood has dealt with this phenomenon. This particular movie focuses on the stressful aspect of being considered for tenure. It follows two friends at a small Pennsylvania college who are up for tenure and some of the colleagues they come into contact with, including a new rival for a tenured position. The movie certainly gets some things right in a general sense such as the publish-or-perish aspect of tenure in some places and the way some teachers can get caught up in an endless cycle of moving from school to school as non-tenured instructors. For the most part, the academic characters fall within the realm of possible real-world types with one big exception. The main character's buddy is some kind of anthropologist who specializes in Bigfoot. This comes across as being a bit unrealistic and while it adds some good comedy relief at points, it detracts from the realism of the movie. Luke Wilson does a pretty good job as the main character. His character is somewhat pessimistic and depressed throughout the movie which is certainly the case with some teachers who are under pressure to nail down a long-term job. His rival is played by Grechen Moll who also does a good job as the supposed superstar who isn't as confident or competent in the classroom as her fame would suggest.Throughout the movie we see the ups and downs of the main character's life as both a teacher and a candidate for tenure in the year he is up for tenure. At no point is tenure a sure bet for him and some of his attempts to do things that will help him backfire. There is also a secondary plot revolving around the main character's father who is himself a retired professor who is beginning to suffer the early effects of Alzheimer's. All of the plot lines resolve themselves in a somewhat unexpected but reasonable manner. Overall, this movie has some lighter moments but is not really a comedy. It also has some romantic moments but it is not really a love story. It is best viewed as a drama about one possible type of experience someone who goes into education could have. The movie doesn't really seem to be attempting to comment terribly heavily on the tenure system per se. The thrust of the film seems to be the exploration of a young professor who is trying to find his niche in academia.",3,Interesting movie that falls a bit short.,1327795200,"01 29, 2012",2012,2426,"['bought', 'movie', 'am', 'currently', 'thinking', 'issue', 'tenure', 'job', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'dealt', 'phenomenon', 'particular', 'movie', 'stressful', 'aspect', 'being', 'considered', 'tenure', 'two', 'friends', 'small', 'Pennsylvania', 'college', 'who', 'are', 'up', 'tenure', 'colleagues', 'come', 'contact', 'including', 'new', 'rival', 'tenured', 'position', 'movie', 'certainly', 'things', 'right', 'general', 'sense', 'such', 'publish-or-perish', 'aspect', 'tenure', 'places', 'way', 'teachers', 'can', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'endless', 'cycle', 'moving', 'school', 'school', 'non-tenured', 'instructors', 'most', 'part', 'academic', 'characters', 'fall', 'realm', 'possible', 'real-world', 'types', 'one', 'big', 'exception', 'main', 'character', 'buddy', 'kind', 'anthropologist', 'who', 'Bigfoot', 'across', 'being', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'good', 'comedy', 'relief', 'points', 'realism', 'movie', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'main', 'character', 'character', 'somewhat', 'pessimistic', 'depressed', 'movie', 'certainly', 'case', 'teachers', 'who', 'are', 'pressure', 'nail', 'down', 'long-term', 'job', 'rival', 'played', 'Grechen', 'Moll', 'who', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'supposed', 'superstar', 'who', ""n't"", 'confident', 'competent', 'classroom', 'fame', 'would', 'suggest.Throughout', 'movie', 'see', 'ups', 'downs', 'main', 'character', 'life', 'teacher', 'candidate', 'tenure', 'year', 'up', 'tenure', 'point', 'sure', 'bet', 'attempts', 'do', 'things', 'will', 'help', 'backfire', 'also', 'secondary', 'plot', 'revolving', 'main', 'character', 'father', 'who', 'retired', 'professor', 'who', 'beginning', 'suffer', 'early', 'effects', 'Alzheimer', 'plot', 'lines', 'resolve', 'somewhat', 'unexpected', 'reasonable', 'manner', 'Overall', 'movie', 'lighter', 'moments', 'not', 'really', 'comedy', 'also', 'romantic', 'moments', 'not', 'really', 'love', 'story', 'best', 'viewed', 'drama', 'one', 'possible', 'type', 'experience', 'someone', 'who', 'education', 'could', 'have', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'attempting', 'comment', 'terribly', 'heavily', 'tenure', 'system', 'se', 'thrust', 'film', 'be', 'exploration', 'young', 'professor', 'who', 'trying', 'find', 'niche', 'academia']",N/A

Salama,"[2, 8]","In a fictitious small college, a mediocre professor of English literature (played by Luke Wilson) see his job threatened because tenure is soon up, and the university has decided to bring in to compete for his job a supposedly brilliant as well as beautiful young professor from Yale (the lovely Gretchen Mol). This is supposed to be an affectionate satire of the academic world in the US, but I found little affection in what I see. As for the supposed humor, I don't recall laughing once at this movie. Seeing these people with their ridiculous trappings, the vain and pompous administrators, it is clear these professors and administrators add very little value to the rest of the society, yet they live not badly and with a certain status. While the movie obviously exaggerates, from what I read is a not altogether incorrect depiction of life in the rarefied US academic world. Are academics smart people? It doesn't seem so from this movie. Here they look pretty pathetic. It's funny how the Gretchen Mol character is repeatedly described as super smart, when she seems to be the typical dumb blonde (she is the most likable character in the movie, though). The Luke Wilson character, though not entirely unlikable, is a man in his late thirties that is still single and unattached, without any real prospect of improving his life, if anything, it is clear that his life would go downhill from here. The character of the anthropologist friend is downright pathetic (and the big foot thing? what was about that?). The dean and the old lady playing the academic director were also repellent characters. Clearly most of these people could not get a job outside of academia. Seeing this movie, I understand why more and more people believe that tenure should be abolished.",2,Very unfunny comedy about the academic world,1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,1774,"['fictitious', 'small', 'college', 'mediocre', 'professor', 'English', 'literature', 'played', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'see', 'job', 'threatened', 'tenure', 'soon', 'up', 'university', 'decided', 'bring', 'compete', 'job', 'supposedly', 'brilliant', 'as', 'well', 'beautiful', 'young', 'professor', 'Yale', 'lovely', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'supposed', 'be', 'affectionate', 'satire', 'academic', 'world', 'US', 'found', 'little', 'affection', 'what', 'see', 'supposed', 'humor', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'laughing', 'once', 'movie', 'Seeing', 'people', 'ridiculous', 'trappings', 'vain', 'pompous', 'administrators', 'clear', 'professors', 'administrators', 'add', 'very', 'little', 'value', 'rest', 'society', 'yet', 'live', 'not', 'badly', 'certain', 'status', 'movie', 'obviously', 'what', 'read', 'not', 'altogether', 'incorrect', 'depiction', 'life', 'rarefied', 'US', 'academic', 'world', 'Are', 'academics', 'smart', 'people', ""n't"", 'seem', 'so', 'movie', 'Here', 'look', 'pretty', 'pathetic', 'funny', 'how', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'character', 'repeatedly', 'described', 'super', 'smart', 'when', 'be', 'typical', 'dumb', 'blonde', 'most', 'likable', 'character', 'movie', 'though', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'character', 'not', 'entirely', 'unlikable', 'man', 'late', 'thirties', 'still', 'single', 'unattached', 'real', 'prospect', 'improving', 'life', 'anything', 'clear', 'life', 'would', 'go', 'downhill', 'here', 'character', 'anthropologist', 'friend', 'downright', 'pathetic', 'big', 'foot', 'thing', 'what', 'was', 'dean', 'old', 'lady', 'playing', 'academic', 'director', 'were', 'also', 'repellent', 'characters', 'Clearly', 'most', 'people', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'job', 'academia', 'Seeing', 'movie', 'understand', 'why', 'more', 'more', 'people', 'believe', 'tenure', 'should', 'be', 'abolished']",N/A

This is one of those and it's a nice, comfy diversion.Here's the scoop. Luke Wilson plays Charlie Thurber, an English Lit professor at a non-descript university in Pennsylvania. He's up for tenure but things aren't looking too good. He hasn't been published in awhile and, though he's a great teacher, he's not up to the politics needed to secure that brass ring. Things get more complicated as a bright, pretty professor (Gretchen Moll) from Yale signs on at his school and is on the fast track to snatch the tenure from under him. That he has a fellow prof that is obsessed with Bigfoot isn't helping matters. Throw in some familial issues and things get even dimmer.This is a fun film. No big whoop but you like the characters so you want to see how it will all play out. Luke Wilson is just that likable kind of guy. He's not very organized but he's upstanding and likes teaching. His students like him and they achieve a relaxed atmosphere in the classroom. His bud tries to help him out by sabotaging Gretchen, but Luke doesn't like it. He doesn't want to win dirty. His buddy prof (David Koechner) is a bit over the top. He's supposed to be an Anthropology prof but he's so obsessive on the Bigfoot thing, and so quick to buy into stupid stuff (such as an herbal Viagra pyramid scheme) you really don't believe him. Moll is a sweetheart so you do want to find out which, if either of them, is going to get tenure. There are other recognizable, veteran actors here so that end of things is good.Again. This is all middle of the road. It clocks in at 89 minutes so it won't strain your time budget. All the production values are as good as they have to be to get the story across.

But he hates academia's competitive paper chase.  After being passed over for tenure once too often, he decides to knuckle down and join the game at bucolic Grey College.  But a screw-loose colleague, a sexy competitor, and family pressures may be more than a loyal English professor can bear.This straight-to-DVD gem will probably never get the recognition it deserves.

Yet I can't help but love this film, possibly because I see myself and my colleagues here on screen.Wilson plays Thurber so he has our sympathy, but doesn't need our pity.  He excels at what he does, and students seek his help because he's a good teacher.  But being good isn't good enough anymore.  Anybody who's ever postponed grading or given students just enough to get by while hammering on our own scholarship to show the department we deserve to exist, will recognize Thurber as one of our own.And this movie doesn't jump out waving jazz hands to convince us we ought to laugh.

How wasteful!Here's the deal (or one version of it).  Tenure gives faculty the freedom to avoid politics in the search for scholarship.  You can see why this might be more essential in some areas (political science, sociology, art) than others (engineering, biology, chemistry).  But the standards for getting tenure, although they vary from institution to institution, usually make receiving tenure difficult.  Many jobs have a probationary period that make it easy to get rid of an employee if the fit is not working out.  Then, the now ex-employee looks for another job.  These probationary periods commonly last for 3-6 months.Now try this system.  You are on probation for 6 YEARS.  And if you fail to pass this threshold, you almost certainly will have to downgrade your professional plans, plans that have probably taken you to one or more graduate degrees plus the 6 year investment.

It's only tenure,""  those in the know KNOW it is the end of THAT world.Charlie Thurber (Wilson) is an excellent teacher, but he can't seem to get any publisher interested in his scholarship.  Jay Hadley (Koechner), already denied tenure, makes it his mission to help Thurber, even when it involves trashing the reputation of the new English professor (Elaine Grasso, played by Gretchen Mol), who is publishing up a storm.Bigfoot makes cameos throughout.Tenure is a gently uplifting comedy, with a number of subplots (erotic poetry club, herbal enhancement, and hired girlfriends) that will also make you smile and chorkle.",4,"""It's not the end of the world.

Once I finished watching this slightly tedious piece though, I felt the main success would be from those expecting a quiet melancholy college life film, supplanted with a loser filled dark humor theme. Throw in a significant Bigfoot search subplot with Koechner leading that charge, and you have a strange little independent film.Wilson is his normal self here playing the morose professor fighting for his tenure, with a perverse sidekick in Koechner (who never really goes into the slapstick/sight gag realm here - he is just plain weird), and one bizarre role of the Alzheimer's dad played by Bob Gunton. No memorable performances, but maybe a couple of laughs, so if you expect nothing (no outright Luke Wilson/Koechner laughorama lines here) then you will be slightly entertained. The writing was skewed towards awkward moments in every day life that almost become unbelievable, but Wilson has the power to convey that with his known looks of confusion.The picture quality is good and the sound is solid for being a first-time feature from this group. The special features are scant and include several minutes of deleted scenes and gags. The entire gag reel is Koechner doing everything he is famous for - so in that aspect this DVD might be worthy enough for you. The only deleted scene worth watching is Koechner being chased by Bigfoot. 3.75 for the film and DVD quality and .25 for the supplements.

I had never heard of TENURE before, but the trailer got my attention.  I've never been a college professor, but I have been a high school teacher and though the rigmarole to get tenure at a high school is different than that at college (you don't have to worry about getting published, for instance) there are many similarities.Luke Wilson stars as Charlie Thurber, an assistant professor of English at Grey College.  Charlie has been teaching there for three years and is up for tenure at the end of the school year.  He thinks his chances are good.  However, when his best friend, Dr. Jay Hadley (David Koechner) is denied tenure and sees his dream job go to an upstart Asian-American, Charlie begins to doubt.  Still, even Dr. Hadley thinks Charlie is a shoe-in until the college hires a female English professor named Elaine Grasso (Gretchen Mol) who taught at Yale.  Suddenly Charlie realizes his job is in jeopardy and he's in the fight for his life.  In between his duties as a professor and faculty advisor, Charlie spends his time with Dr. Hadley hunting Bigfoot and hanging out with his Dad who has been prematurely placed into a retirement home.Wilson is his usual film self and, like the character he plays who is born to teach, he does what he does best.  Koechner is usually a joy to watch and that's no different in TENURE.  However, Koechner's role is bit more low key than the roles he usually appears in.  Gretchen Mol is beautiful as ever and does a nice job as the female foil to Charlie.  Bob Gunton portrays Charlie's Dad and the viewer can't help feeling sorry for the man in complete control of his mental faculties who finds himself in a place he really doesn't belong.I really enjoyed TENURE.  It's a small quiet comedy seeped in realism without any hyperbole.  Though it's not the typical film Wilson and Koechner appear in, TENURE is a pleasant, little joy of a film.The extras on the DVD are minuscule:  a few deleted scenes and a reel of outtakes.",4,"Pleasant, Low-Keyed Joy",1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,2046,"['happened', 'see', 'trailer', 'TENURE', 'DVD', 'had', 'rented', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'TENURE', 'trailer', 'got', 'attention', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'college', 'professor', 'have', 'been', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'rigmarole', 'get', 'tenure', 'high', 'school', 'different', 'college', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry', 'getting', 'published', 'instance', 'are', 'many', 'similarities.Luke', 'Wilson', 'stars', 'Charlie', 'Thurber', 'assistant', 'professor', 'English', 'Grey', 'College', 'Charlie', 'been', 'teaching', 'there', 'three', 'years', 'up', 'tenure', 'end', 'school', 'year', 'chances', 'are', 'good', 'However', 'when', 'best', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Jay', 'Hadley', 'David', 'Koechner', 'denied', 'tenure', 'dream', 'job', 'go', 'upstart', 'Asian-American', 'Charlie', 'doubt', 'Still', 'even', 'Dr.', 'Hadley', 'thinks', 'Charlie', 'shoe-in', 'college', 'female', 'English', 'professor', 'named', 'Elaine', 'Grasso', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'who', 'taught', 'Yale', 'Suddenly', 'Charlie', 'job', 'jeopardy', 'fight', 'life', 'duties', 'professor', 'faculty', 'advisor', 'Charlie', 'time', 'Dr.', 'Hadley', 'hunting', 'Bigfoot', 'hanging', 'out', 'Dad', 'who', 'been', 'prematurely', 'placed', 'retirement', 'home.Wilson', 'usual', 'film', 'self', 'character', 'who', 'born', 'teach', 'what', 'best', 'Koechner', 'usually', 'joy', 'watch', 'different', 'TENURE', 'However', 'Koechner', 'role', 'bit', 'more', 'low', 'key', 'roles', 'usually', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'beautiful', 'ever', 'nice', 'job', 'female', 'foil', 'Charlie', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'Charlie', 'Dad', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'man', 'complete', 'control', 'mental', 'faculties', 'who', 'place', 'really', ""n't"", 'belong.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'TENURE', 'small', 'quiet', 'comedy', 'seeped', 'realism', 'hyperbole', 'not', 'typical', 'film', 'Wilson', 'Koechner', 'appear', 'TENURE', 'pleasant', 'little', 'joy', 'film.The', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'minuscule', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'reel', 'outtakes']",N/A
1320739,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00344EAPU,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","""Tenure"" turned out to be a pleasant watch, a fun and quirky take on college politics, revolving around a college instructor's attempts to obtain tenure. Luke Wilson plays Charlie Thurber, a popular English professor who just can't seem to publish anything, and this places him at a disadvantage when it comes to procuring the much-valued tenure. His best friend, a professor in the anthropology department, Jay Hadley (David Koechner) is a bizarre character who is adamant that he has evidence that Bigfoot exists, and pulls all sorts of stunts, often with the hapless Thurber getting dragged along for the ride.Thurber's only other rival for tenure is newcomer Elaine Grasso (Gretchen Mol) who is not only from Yale, but has managed to get her article published. There are several other story arcs that all kind of mesh together, albeit in an awkward manner at times - there's Thurber's father William (Bob Gunton), a former professor and resident at a memory care facility; Thurber and his sister's constant bickering about their father's care and the money needed for it (she demands it, he makes excuses); Hadley's Bigfoot club and their pursuit of the elusive sasquatch; the erotic poetry club that Thurber agrees to advise with only one member; the female student who comes on to Thurber - quite a lot of story arcs for a small, indie flick.Somehow, the various story arcs come together, and ultimately this is a low-key comedy/drama that might appeal to those who can relate to faculty politics.",3,Quirky take on faculty politics,1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,1503,"['Tenure', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'fun', 'quirky', 'take', 'college', 'politics', 'revolving', 'college', 'instructor', 'attempts', 'obtain', 'tenure', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Charlie', 'Thurber', 'popular', 'English', 'professor', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'publish', 'anything', 'disadvantage', 'when', 'procuring', 'much-valued', 'tenure', 'best', 'friend', 'professor', 'anthropology', 'department', 'Jay', 'Hadley', 'David', 'Koechner', 'bizarre', 'character', 'who', 'adamant', 'evidence', 'Bigfoot', 'sorts', 'stunts', 'often', 'hapless', 'Thurber', 'getting', 'dragged', 'along', 'ride.Thurber', 'only', 'other', 'rival', 'tenure', 'newcomer', 'Elaine', 'Grasso', 'Gretchen', 'Mol', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'Yale', 'managed', 'get', 'article', 'published', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'story', 'arcs', 'kind', 'mesh', 'together', 'albeit', 'awkward', 'manner', 'times', 'Thurber', 'father', 'William', 'Bob', 'Gunton', 'former', 'professor', 'resident', 'memory', 'care', 'facility', 'Thurber', 'sister', 'constant', 'bickering', 'father', 'care', 'money', 'needed', 'excuses', 'Hadley', 'Bigfoot', 'club', 'pursuit', 'elusive', 'sasquatch', 'erotic', 'poetry', 'club', 'Thurber', 'advise', 'only', 'one', 'member', 'female', 'student', 'who', 'Thurber', 'quite', 'lot', 'story', 'arcs', 'small', 'indie', 'flick.Somehow', 'various', 'story', 'arcs', 'come', 'together', 'ultimately', 'low-key', 'comedy/drama', 'might', 'appeal', 'who', 'can', 'relate', 'faculty', 'politics']",N/A
