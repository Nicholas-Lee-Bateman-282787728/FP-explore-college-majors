My daughter age 5 and my son age 3 recently have been introduced to this show and are quite taken with it! The latest not to miss out on DVD releasing soon by nCircle that my family got to pre-screen is called &#8220;Octonauts: To the Gup-X&#8221;. On this feature, there's non-stop adventure in which kids discover the lovable characters exploring, rescuing, and protecting all sorts of animals of the sea! We've not just been watching but using it during our homeschool time too.This DVD is 70 minutes long, you can easily sit and watch all the episodes or break it up and watch one at a time (especially if you want to use these along in a science lesson). There are a total of six episodes and two bonus features. Some of the sea creatures children will learn educational facts about are Great White Sharks, Coconut Crabs, Bowhead Whales, Whale Sharks, Flying Fish, and more! The facts are mentioned in each episode as the story goes along but also will be brought up during the end in the &#34;Creature Report&#34;. I'll have to admit that even I learned a new thing or two. Way to go for summarizing the facts!My kids have watched the DVD numerous time and have yet to tire of it. My daughter liked seeing the Narwhals and my son thought the coconut crabs were pretty cool. I'd like to mention that even though there's sharks which can be frightening and other potentially suspenseful situations, the show presents these situations well without scaring kids.Overall we wouldn't hesitate to recommend the series! Randomly throughout the day my kids will come up to me and let me know about some neat fact they learned while watching! It's not just great entertainment but has actual educational benefits to it as well. Who knows, maybe this will encourage a child to be a marine biologist or another career pertaining to the sea!",5,Fun and Educational!,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,1900,"['child', 'interested', 'Ocean', 'sure', 'love', 'Ocotonauts', 'daughter', 'age', '5', 'son', 'age', '3', 'recently', 'have', 'been', 'introduced', 'show', 'are', 'quite', 'taken', 'latest', 'not', 'miss', 'out', 'DVD', 'releasing', 'soon', 'nCircle', 'family', 'got', 'pre-screen', 'called', '8220', 'Octonauts', 'Gup-X', '8221', 'feature', 'non-stop', 'adventure', 'kids', 'discover', 'lovable', 'characters', 'exploring', 'rescuing', 'protecting', 'sorts', 'animals', 'sea', ""'ve"", 'not', 'just', 'been', 'watching', 'using', 'homeschool', 'time', 'too.This', 'DVD', '70', 'minutes', 'long', 'can', 'easily', 'sit', 'watch', 'episodes', 'break', 'up', 'watch', 'one', 'time', 'especially', 'want', 'use', 'science', 'lesson', 'are', 'total', 'six', 'episodes', 'two', 'bonus', 'features', 'sea', 'children', 'will', 'learn', 'educational', 'facts', 'are', 'Great', 'White', 'Sharks', 'Coconut', 'Crabs', 'Bowhead', 'Whales', 'Whale', 'Sharks', 'Flying', 'Fish', 'more', 'facts', 'are', 'mentioned', 'episode', 'story', 'along', 'also', 'will', 'be', 'brought', 'up', 'end', '34', 'Creature', 'Report', '34', ""'ll"", 'have', 'admit', 'even', 'learned', 'new', 'thing', 'two', 'Way', 'go', 'summarizing', 'facts', 'kids', 'have', 'watched', 'DVD', 'numerous', 'time', 'have', 'yet', 'tire', 'daughter', 'liked', 'seeing', 'Narwhals', 'son', 'thought', 'coconut', 'crabs', 'were', 'pretty', 'cool', ""'d"", 'like', 'mention', 'even', 'sharks', 'can', 'be', 'frightening', 'other', 'potentially', 'suspenseful', 'situations', 'show', 'situations', 'well', 'scaring', 'kids.Overall', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'recommend', 'series', 'Randomly', 'day', 'kids', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'let', 'know', 'neat', 'fact', 'learned', 'watching', 'not', 'just', 'great', 'entertainment', 'actual', 'educational', 'benefits', 'as', 'well', 'Who', 'maybe', 'will', 'encourage', 'child', 'be', 'marine', 'biologist', 'career', 'pertaining', 'sea']",Octonauts: To the Gup-X

This is the second Octonaunt DVD we own, my son is still really young and I originally thought it would be geared more towards older kids. But I was pleasantly surprised to find out The Octonauts are good for all kids. My son loves the cute Oconaunt crew and how they help others. He may not get the educational parts just yet but they are done in a way that he still enjoys it. Every episode has a Creature Report rap up at the end of the episode. Basically it is actual pictures and some interesting facts about the creature we just met during the episode. The report is done to a catchy little song, so that younger kids can enjoy it. The older kids will find the photos and facts interesting.  As a parent I really love that the Octonauts are not just fun but educational as well. Every episode they meet a new creature and help them out in one way or another. It teaches my son to be kind and helpful to everyone and I really like that. As he gets older I think he will start taking a bit more out of the creature report as well.The Octonauts: To The Gup-X has 6 great episodes about the Great White Sharks, Coconut Crabs, Bowhead Whales, Whale Sharks, Octopuses and Flying Fish.  The DVD runs about 70 minutes, so it gives a parent a little break or a chance to get things done.  There is also a bonus section where you can watch all 6 Creature Reports as well as a Close Up Of The Gup-X. The Gup-X is the newest of their vehicles (there are 5 others) that they use to help the creatures they meet.I want my son to watch things he enjoys but I also want him to be able to take some sort of  educational value too. The Octonauts are just that.

That&#8217;s always cool. The animals in the submarine are these pseudo-animal creatures that I really can&#8217;t identify but my kids love them.. The adventures usually involve some animal that&#8217;s in trouble. Not the WonderPets kind of trouble, but a serious threat like a shark who has been injured and needs to be given first aid (but the Octonauts have to avoid being eaten). My kids like to learn the facts that are in the Creature Report at the end of each episode. There were some episodes on the DVD that my kids hadn&#8217;t seen, so that was good. I especially liked the diversity of the dialects in this collection of Octonauts shows. The episodes are quite short at around 10 minutes each and there are 8 on this DVD.  It's perfect for keeping in the van for those short errand runs.  I received this DVD to review. The opinions shared here are 100% mine.",5,My kids love to learn from the Creature Report,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,983,"['Octonauts', 'are', 'real', 'treat', 'kids', 'learn', 'animals', 'First', '8217', 's', 'submarine', '8217', 'always', 'cool', 'animals', 'submarine', 'are', 'pseudo-animal', 'creatures', 'really', 'can', '8217', 'identify', 'kids', 'love', 'adventures', 'usually', 'involve', 'animal', '8217', 's', 'trouble', 'Not', 'WonderPets', 'kind', 'trouble', 'serious', 'threat', 'shark', 'who', 'been', 'injured', 'be', 'given', 'first', 'aid', 'Octonauts', 'have', 'avoid', 'being', 'eaten', 'kids', 'learn', 'facts', 'are', 'Creature', 'Report', 'end', 'episode', 'were', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'kids', 'hadn', '8217', 'seen', 'was', 'good', 'especially', 'liked', 'diversity', 'dialects', 'collection', 'Octonauts', 'shows', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'short', '10', 'minutes', 'are', '8', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'keeping', 'van', 'short', 'errand', 'runs', 'received', 'DVD', 'review', 'opinions', 'shared', 'here', 'are', '100', '%', 'mine']",Octonauts: To the Gup-X
