1150893,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B0015U0QWG,Anthony Pittore,"[1, 1]","In recent years, there have been few horror films that could be considered great, and sadly, most of those great horrors come from outside the United States, the nation which once ruled horror. 'Otis,' however, comes to change that up, and change it up well.Otis Broth is obsessive. Otis Broth is disgusting. Otis Broth is psychotic. But Otis Broth is also a romantic. He wants the perfect girl to bring to the Prom. The perfect girl to enjoy the front seat of his Trans Am with on the 'bluff.' For Otis, this perfect girl is (after five other attempts) is Riley Lawson (Ashley Johnson of 'Growing Pains'). . . though he likes to call her Kim. After capturing Riley, Otis takes her back to the hovel that is the Broth household and treats her like the lady she is. . . only, in his mind, blinding lights and shackles are the chivalrous ways to treat his lady. After efforts by the police fail to find Riley, the parents (Illeana Douglas and Daniel Stern) bring their son (Jared Kusnitz) along to do what the cops are failing to do: Take care of the murderous Otis themselves.Playing out like a comedic 'Last House on the Left,' 'Otis' turns the family-revenge tale into a near-slapstick horror-comedy, but it never goes TOO far over the edge of comedy and, thankfully, remains well in the realm of brutal exploit thriller/horror. While it's not overly disgusting or gory, the violence and subject matter will appeal to fans of exploitation cinema looking for a good modern flick that surpasses the normal 'Hostel'-type Hollywood torture film. The writing is sharp, the direction is well done, and the acting is superb. There are enough one-liners and constant comedy to keep us laughing throughout and the characters will make anyone from a dysfunctional suburban family reminisce. . . I know I did. And a great, ballsy, open-ended conclusion left us drooling for 'Otis 2.' Overall, 'Otis' is a hilariously fresh new horror-comedy that is set for cult fame.Final Verdict: A worthy 8.5/10.

The scenes where Otis forces his attentions on his victim are played straight and are downright uncomfortable to sit through. The scenes where the victim's family goes ""Lord of the Flies"" and takes its revenge are definitely played for laughs, dark laughs, but laughs.The mood swings are a little jarring and some of the acting is over the top (the FBI agents are all played strictly for laughs and that clashes a little with the tone of the rest of the movie), but all in all the gimmick works.

Moulton ""BookmanNYC""","[1, 1]","I'm a horror buff in the making, catching up on classics and cults and devouring what's new (with exception of brainless torture porn).Otis falls prey to a young director (Tony Krantz) having too many ideas for one movie, which takes a top-notch premise and clouds it with bells and whistles.Otis' character is fleshed-out, sympathetic, and wonderfully acted by Bostin Christopher. I went back and forth between hating and loving him. Also, a bravo to Ashley Johnson (What Women Want and others) for an overall wonderful performance.Where this movie fails is:- the score, which is near constant and distracting. I understand to homage it makes, but it should never overlap key dialogue.- Edits skip from the exquisitely handled basement scenes to the family, which is cut like a sitcom at best and weak kitsch at worst.- the twist at the end. Not so much a negative as a missed opportunity. Yes, unpredictable. Yes, lots of better opportunities with these great characters.-Some characters sucked the life out of the film. Jere Burns as Agent Hotchkiss. Yes, he was intended (I hope) to be a caricature for inept and useless cops in a visceral situation beyond what the law could do, but does he always have to be chewing gum? Being insensitive? Overt characters have a purpose, but if you lose the subtley there you have to make it up somewhere else.Some positives+ GREAT basement scenes and use of filters+ original concept in a wash of the same+ some great characters and relationships+ Kevin Pollak with the convincing supporting role??? wow.In short:Well worth a rental for horror junkies and enthusiasts. You owe it to yourself to see how Otis and Riley play off each other. The ending twist, schizophrenic production and overpowering score confuse an otherwise good film.Parents: Not too much gore in this movie beyond an intense scene at the end.

The taboo topic, the ear-bleedingly offensive language, the unrelenting gore, the sight of lovable actors ""behaving badly."" (Man, you should just leave this page now!) Think of this work as the comedic equivalent of McNaughton'sHenry - Portrait of a Serial Killer. (You don't know Henry? Oh, duuude ... make a run for it ... you have no idea what you're dealing with!) This film's sketchy/creepy/cringe factor is astronomical (even I was tempted to fast-forward through the MAJOR torture scene ... but I wasn't gonna let the film beat me!!). (I'm telling you, right now, this may be a complete waste of money for you ... I'm sensing that you might cash in your stocks, invest in steamroller, and obliterate this disk. Just a guess.) This is one really, really sick film ... and I just loved it.The movie's namesake, Otis, is not so much a paedophile as he is a forty-year-old man trapped in his senior-year of high-school. Over and over, he relives the days preceding his Prom and revels in the glorious event itself (there is a little twist here that I would not dare reveal). Otis' only desire is to find the perfect partner (""Kim"") to reenact it with him. Needless to say, the teenagers he abducts struggle to understand his desires ... and come-undone (LITERALLY!)Here's the thing: this film is wildly, inappropriately funny. The actors pull-out all the stops!! Jere Burns (of tremendous television fame) plays his role of the careless, perverted FBI agent to a ""T."" He is one of the only men in the world to make laser-pointing and gum-chewing lascivious! Moreover, it's great to see Daniel Stern (""Will Lawson"") in yet another grotesque comedy (if you have not seen Berg'sVery Bad Things, you must!) And Illeana Douglas (""Kate Lawson"") just has an insane talent for this style of work (her role in Koepp'sStir of Echoeshas always cracked me up!) BUT, the real shock is seeing Ashley Johnson (""Riley Lawson"") tackle such a challenging role ... quite a departure from her ""precious"" character onGrowing Pains. As a side note, I must admit that I was most impressed with relative new-comer Jared Kusnitz (""Reed Lawson""). His delivery was as flawless as it was funny. In reality, it's the cast that REALLY makes this film!!I would LOVE to venture into the details of this film, but out of consideration for the viewers who will really enjoy this piece, I will refrain. I do not want to spoil a single FREAKY moment!If you think it's a shame to smash yard-gnomes (Otis has a much better purpose for them), if you  think references to Coppola'sApocalypse Noware a laugh-riot, and if you were just waiting for an inappropriately-appropriate use of Blue Oyster Cult's ""Don't Fear the Reaper,"" (one of the most poorly used songs in horror-history) you are soooo in luck!!

Wilson ""SonRisedInTheEast""","[2, 2]","Last time director Tony Krantz hooked up with Raw Feed (distributor of this film), the end result was a movie entitled Sublime (which ironically enough, was anything but...).  If you saw it, you probably don't remember much about it due to the fact that, if you were lucky you fell asleep early, OR that your mind has buried the near 2 hours of dull, over polished, metaphysical dreck that it was with other overly awful moments from the genre (i.e. Blair Witch 2, Anaconda, and nearly every Japanese horror remake).  Well, with some surprise I bring you good news as far as Otis is concerned... it doesn't suck!  In fact, it's good enough that I'm even kinda looking forward to this guys next movie... huh, how's that for a nice twist?  Otis is the story of a hulking and demented 40 year old pizza delivery guy looking for love (and more importantly, a prom date)-- in any unsuspecting neighborhod windows that allow easy access.  Unfortunately for Otis though, he didn't expect his next victims family to be willing to do whatever it takes to exact their vengeance... hijinx ensue!  No really, they do this time!  You see, this is a horror/comedy (I probably should have made note of that earlier but...)and while it's never disturbing or scary, it does get a lot of the humor right, which makes for a fun watch (if only one).  Of course, the obvious flipside of this is that it's a pretty light and fluffy affair... unlike the great exploitative horror/revenge films that it imitates, you won't be left feeling dirty and ashamed at all by the end of this (in fact, the most depraved thing you see is a girl get punched in the face).  Still though, it's a horror/comedy that actually works, plus it has a fantastic cast (David Pollak in particular)... great film to watch with the significant other who ""isn't normally into these type of movies.""",3,The family that slays together stays together!,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",2008,1849,"['Last', 'time', 'director', 'Tony', 'Krantz', 'hooked', 'up', 'Raw', 'Feed', 'distributor', 'film', 'end', 'result', 'was', 'movie', 'entitled', 'Sublime', 'ironically', 'enough', 'was', 'anything', 'saw', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'much', 'due', 'fact', 'were', 'lucky', 'fell', 'asleep', 'early', 'OR', 'mind', 'buried', 'near', '2', 'hours', 'dull', 'polished', 'metaphysical', 'dreck', 'was', 'other', 'overly', 'awful', 'moments', 'genre', 'i.e', 'Blair', 'Witch', '2', 'Anaconda', 'nearly', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'remake', 'Well', 'surprise', 'bring', 'good', 'news', 'as', 'far', 'Otis', 'concerned', ""n't"", 'suck', 'fact', 'good', 'enough', ""'m"", 'even', 'kinda', 'looking', 'forward', 'guys', 'next', 'movie', 'huh', 'how', 'nice', 'twist', 'Otis', 'story', 'hulking', 'demented', '40', 'year', 'old', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'guy', 'looking', 'love', 'more', 'importantly', 'prom', 'date', 'unsuspecting', 'neighborhod', 'allow', 'easy', 'access', 'Unfortunately', 'Otis', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'next', 'victims', 'family', 'be', 'willing', 'do', 'whatever', 'exact', 'vengeance', 'hijinx', 'ensue', 'really', 'do', 'time', 'see', 'horror/comedy', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'note', 'earlier', 'never', 'disturbing', 'scary', 'get', 'lot', 'humor', 'right', 'fun', 'watch', 'only', 'one', 'course', 'obvious', 'flipside', 'pretty', 'light', 'fluffy', 'affair', 'great', 'exploitative', 'horror/revenge', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'left', 'feeling', 'dirty', 'ashamed', 'end', 'fact', 'most', 'depraved', 'thing', 'see', 'girl', 'get', 'punched', 'face', 'Still', 'horror/comedy', 'actually', 'fantastic', 'cast', 'David', 'Pollak', 'particular', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'significant', 'other', 'who', ""n't"", 'normally', 'type', 'movies']",Otis

Eventually these girls fight back and die.  His latest victim, Riley (the beautiful Ashley Johnson) has a bit more fight than he's used to.  And her family is even more aggressive.The cast does a great job pulling the story together.  Illena Douglas, who always does a great job, is incredible as the mother who has gone a little crazy.  Ashley Johnson is perfect as Riley.  She has that nice combo of being both hot and yet very sweet at the same time, much like the character she played on CSI.I think the stand out actor on this is Jared Kusnitz, who I also saw in Dance of the Dead (incredibly good movie).  Somehow the movie gets a little funnier every time he's in a scene.One note on casting...I couldn't help feeling like Kevin Pollack and Daniel Stern were cast in each others roles as the brother of Otis and the father of Ashley Johnson, repetitively.  They both did a great job, but Daniel Stern looks much more like the brother of Otis than Pollack.

1150903,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,B0015U0QWG,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[0, 2]","It seems I have been reviewing a lot of horror movies these days. It's not on purpose. I do like other types of movies, but I keep hearing good things about certain ""never released to the screen"" horror movies that I keep trying them out. Considering my reviews, like for Teeth, you'd think I review them just to blast them. Finally, I have something good to say, after watching the wonderful serial joker, Otis.Otis is the story of a forty-something year-old pedophile named Otis(played by new-comer Boston Christopher) who is looking for a date for the prom. He does the right things, asking a girl's parents for permission to date their daughter, rocking out the old school Trans-Am, throwing around the old pig skin, calling the girl on the telephone all the time, and working hard as a pizza delivery boy. The problem is, he does this all after kidnapping the girls and locking them in his basement, torturing them mentally and physically, and usually killing them, accidentally. This has happened five times, the authorities have no clues, and he is continuing his quest for the perfect date for the prom.Otis kidnaps one lucky teenager, Riley Lawson (played by Ashley Johnson), but is thwarted by her attempt to actually allow him to work his magic as a supreme catch, all 400 pounds of him. Her family, upon learning of Otis' place of residence, take it upon themselves to unleash vengeance in ways Otis himself could not dream, with disasterous, and funny, results.What's great about this movie is how it portrays Otis himself. He is a psychotic pedophile, but through the movie we gain some sympathy for him, even while he is hacking up his latest date that dumped him. It is this sympathy that makes us laugh at ourselves, and the movie itself. This would seem bad, but the movie calls for it hungrily.Riley's family is fantastic. Daniel Stern and Illeana Douglas play the part of doting parents wonderfully. They are the stereotypical suburban family, with a Otis Movie Familyloving daughter and a delinquent son. Their try at vengeance plays on this wholesomeness, and makes a movie like Last House on the Left seem pale in comparison, if only for its odd outcome. There is one scene where the family is unloading their truck that is absolutely ridiculous.Kevin Pollak plays Otis' naive and abusive brother. Although only a supporting role, the role he plays in the family's vengeance is like nothing I've ever seen before. Think of a battery hooked up to a man's sphincter. If you find that funny, you will love Pollak, again. The FBI agent, played by Jere Burns, fleshes out the hysterics. It is his bumbling police work that makes the rest of the movie work. If he actually had a brain in his head, maybe they would have caught Otis the second time around. I'm sure glad THAT didn't happen.This movie was a breath of fresh air for the horror comedy genre. The laughs are as black as night, and it works to make you feel a bit uncomfortable, but still giddy at the same time. The gore factor was a bit lacking, but the elements of imagination, such as drinking your own toes, are ripe. If the gore was there, it would probably lose a lot of its comedic elements.All in all, I give this movie 4 out of 5 dateless nights.

1150912,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B0015U0QWG,Michael R Gates,"[0, 0]","Question: What do you get when you take Wes Craven's original THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972), add a sitcom-like case of mistaken identity, and then mix in lots of seriocomic dialogue? Answer: Tony Krantz's OTIS, the story of a family who chooses to bypass the police system and instead privately mete out punishment to the middle-aged nerd who abducted their daughter and forced her to act out his unfulfilled high-school fantasies.  Now, I know what you're thinking. You're saying to yourself, ""Oh, no! It's another cinematic study of just how low normal people can sink in the name of revenge!""  But you're only partially right.  OTIS is a revenge thriller, true, but it actually manages to turn the subgenre's conventions on their ear.  When the avenging family members in this flick sink to depths even deeper than their nemesis, they get a bit haughty and careless...and that's when things get really twisted.Aside from the upturned cliches, OTIS also rises above the standard revenge thriller because the cast turns in some outstanding performances.  At the top of the list is actor Jere Burns, veteran of numerous films and TV shows who is probably best known for his role as lounge lizard Kirk in the late-1980s sitcom DEAR JOHN.  Here Burns is knee-slappingly hilarious playing the smarmy, egocentric, and tactless FBI agent investigating the abduction.  As the titular Otis, Bostin Christopher paints a very convincing portrait of a hapless outcast who has marinated in his own insecurities for so long that he's turned into a homicidal sociopath.  Other notable turns come from Kevin Pollak (from 1992's A FEW GOOD MEN), who delivers a strong but appropriately restrained performance as Otis' abusive older brother; Daniel Stern (1990's HOME ALONE and the uncredited narrator on TV's THE WONDER YEARS) in a hilarious performance as the milquetoast father of the abducted girl; Illeana Douglas (1990's GOODFELLAS and 1999's STIR OF ECHOES) as the ball-busting mother who instigates the plan of vengeance; and Jared Kusnitz (2008's DANCE OF THE DEAD), who is both witty and convincing as the rebellious but caring brother of the abducted girl.Now, in spite of all that is good about OTIS, the film also has a few weaknesses, the first and foremost of which are plausibility issues.  Unlike her counterpart in other revenge thrillers, the abducted girl in this film comes out of the ordeal relatively unscathed, making it difficult for the audience to suspend disbelief and accept that the girl's fairly mainstream middle-class family would engage in such brutal acts of revenge. Secondly, the film is totally lacking in the nudity department.  Considering the nature of his crimes and his motivation for committing them, the eponymous Otis would undoubtedly force his prey to disrobe on occasion.  Since most contemporary horror films and thrillers that are aimed at adult audiences contain a few T&A; shots, there is a certain expectation for such on the part of viewers, and the lack of skin in OTIS is therefore a glaring omission.  And finally, after all the violence and folly, the film's relatively tame denouement is anticlimactic and ultimately unsatisfying.Still, in spite of its shortcomings, OTIS is a well-made, well-acted black comedy that successfully turns the clich&eacute;d revenge thriller on its head.  The DVD and Blu-ray discs from Warner present the unrated version of the film in anamorphic widescreen, and the picture and sound (at least on the Blu-ray) are breathtaking.  Unfortunately, both discs are no-frills and are therefore devoid of bonus material, but amazon.com's price of admission is nonetheless very reasonable.

This is a highly orignal story with outstanding acting from the male lead who plays Otis, and great support from veteran charecter actor Kevin Pollack.

But as a thriller horror(?) fan, I thought I should just give this movie a chance, and I did. Glad I did though. That was an experience.Otis is a psychosociopath, who is also a Pizza delivery guy, who is also kinda pathetic in this movie (imho). He met a girl, Riley Lawson, while deliverying a pizza and decided she is ""his Kim"" (don't ask, I don't even know since that never seems to be explained quite clearly in  the movie at all) . Anyhoo, Otis kidnapped Riley in broad daylight, I don't know how Reed (her younger brother) can't even hear her screaming for help at the moment.Then the whole weird ordeal started.Otis is playing role games with Riley during her whole isolation time and her parents have to deal with a dufus sad excuse of FBI agent called HotchKiss. Honestl, he doesn't look professional but hey I let that slide since this is a comedy thriller genre to begin with. The movie goes on weirder and weird at each minute but I must admit, I love a crooked sense of humor in movies I watch.Ok, Overall. The movie is interesting. Not for hardcore Thriller fans cause this would make you throw a rotton tomato or two at the screen. The characters are pretty much quirky in their own way. the scenes are though set for the thriller scenes throughout the show.My reaction: lots of eye raising action from me while watching it.

1150916,A3P8ZDHC7XSKSE,B0015U0QWG,"Ravenskya ""Princess of Horror""","[29, 30]","This is a STRANGE movie.  We saw the trailer for it on ""The Orphanage"" DVD and thought, well that movie looks pretty funny, let's get that.Short Synopsis: Otis is a hulking pervert who captures teenage girls and takes them home where he fulfills his high school fantasies, forcing them to ""play along.""  Otis got more than he bargained for when he abducts Riley whose family has a collective screw loose to begin with.This movie was funny in a dark and almost sad way.  Everyone in the film is warped so the only character you can really identify with is Riley... and she doesn't say much.  The scenes between Riley and Otis are by far the most well acted in the film, they are both disturbing and hysterically funny.  Riley's family however never seemed to click, what should have been the funniest scenes in the movie were overacted which seriously drained the humor out of them.  Each character was funny in their own right, but as a unit they never meshed completely.  Still this was a very enjoyable film with much less gore than anticipated, no nudity (sorry boys) but for those of you who don't like profanity, this movie is full of it.  I don't have an issue with profanity in R rated movies... but the profanity in this one feels a bit forced, as if either the actors weren't comfortable using it, or they just couldn't get the rhythm of what they were saying.Even though the acting was a bit off, this was a really fun movie with quite a few laughs.  I would say its best viewed in a group setting with a couple of beers and popcorn.Since it's unrated I'll give you my rating synopsis -Nudity - None, though there is a girl in her underwear.Sex - None seen, though it is mentioned and alluded toViolence - I'd give this an R for one particular sceneProfanity - Definite RDrug use - There is mention of drugs, and you see the son popping pills.",4,"Highly entertaining, but not for everyone",1213228800,"06 12, 2008",2008,1853,"['STRANGE', 'movie', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Orphanage', 'DVD', 'thought', 'well', 'movie', 'pretty', 'funny', 'let', 'get', 'that.Short', 'Synopsis', 'Otis', 'hulking', 'pervert', 'who', 'teenage', 'girls', 'home', 'where', 'high', 'school', 'fantasies', 'forcing', 'play', 'along', 'Otis', 'got', 'more', 'bargained', 'when', 'Riley', 'family', 'collective', 'screw', 'loose', 'begin', 'with.This', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'dark', 'almost', 'sad', 'way', 'Everyone', 'film', 'warped', 'so', 'only', 'character', 'can', 'really', 'identify', 'Riley', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'scenes', 'Riley', 'Otis', 'are', 'far', 'most', 'well', 'acted', 'film', 'are', 'disturbing', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'Riley', 'family', 'however', 'never', 'seemed', 'click', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'overacted', 'seriously', 'drained', 'humor', 'character', 'was', 'funny', 'own', 'right', 'unit', 'never', 'meshed', 'completely', 'Still', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'much', 'less', 'gore', 'anticipated', 'nudity', 'sorry', 'boys', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'profanity', 'movie', 'full', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'issue', 'profanity', 'R', 'rated', 'movies', 'profanity', 'one', 'bit', 'forced', 'actors', 'were', ""n't"", 'comfortable', 'using', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'rhythm', 'what', 'were', 'saying.Even', 'acting', 'was', 'bit', 'off', 'was', 'really', 'fun', 'movie', 'few', 'laughs', 'would', 'say', 'best', 'viewed', 'group', 'setting', 'couple', 'beers', 'popcorn.Since', 'unrated', ""'ll"", 'give', 'rating', 'synopsis', '-Nudity', 'None', 'girl', 'underwear.Sex', 'None', 'seen', 'mentioned', 'alluded', 'toViolence', ""'d"", 'give', 'R', 'one', 'particular', 'sceneProfanity', 'Definite', 'RDrug', 'use', 'mention', 'drugs', 'see', 'son', 'popping', 'pills']",Otis
