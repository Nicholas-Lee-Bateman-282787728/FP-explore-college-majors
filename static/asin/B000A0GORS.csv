Like I said in the review for the Season 2 set,Brady Bunch fans will own a copy of the entire series before too long. The only difference between this season and the previous two are the Brady kids growing taller. This is immediately noticeable with Greg(Barry Williams). He must have grown about six inches in height since the series premiered in 1969. Williams was 15 years old then. Carol's(Florence Henderson) youngest daughter Cindy(Susan Olsen)is starting to outgrow her cuteness. Even oldest daughter Marcia(Maureen McCormick)is maturing into a beautiful young woman. Here are the episodes that aired between fall 1971 and spring 1972.

917726,A1PS4EZLXYMNPF,B000A0GORS,"BRADLEY R HUTSON ""hutsman""","[4, 5]","I've noticed some reviewers complaining about the lack of ""In Color"" messages at the beginning of the shows, as well as missing cast boxes on the Grand Canyon episodes.  I'm pretty sure that the ""In Color"" messages were never present on these episodes in the first place.  I think that practice had been abandoned by the start of the 1971-72 seasons of all TV shows.  In the ""All in the Family"" DVD box sets, only Season One (Spring 1971) has the ""In Color"" message.  Season Two (Fall 1971-Spring 1972) did NOT have it.  I don't think ANY shows had them by that time.  Color television had been around for long enough at that point that continuing to brag about shows being ""In Color"" would have tended to be overkill by then, don't you think?  Of course I can't swear to it, but I really think that they are not missing since they were likely never there at all.As for the missing cast boxes on the Grand Canyon episodes, maybe those particular episodes did not use them.  That is completely a guess on my part, but since the episodes were of a different nature than the other single part episodes, maybe that practice was not used for them.  I could be completely wrong about that, but it seems to me to be a real possibility.  How many people remember for sure if they had those boxes from the original airing?  I was BORN right around the time this season wrapped, so I obviously did not see them first-run.  I have no clue if the syndicated reruns I watched in the late 1970's had cast boxes on those episodes or not.  Can anyone say for absolute certainty that the boxes DID exist for those episodes?Don't pass on this box set for just these reasons alone.  I don't want anything to be missing from my TV show box sets either (some of my other reviews will attest to that), but in a case like this even if those two items did exist at one time and are in fact missing here, what IS here far outweighs those particular items.  Buy this box set if you like ""The Brady Bunch"", and you'll be glad you did.",5,This Set Might Not Have Anything Missing After All...,1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,2007,"[""'ve"", 'noticed', 'reviewers', 'complaining', 'lack', 'Color', 'messages', 'beginning', 'shows', 'as', 'well', 'missing', 'cast', 'boxes', 'Grand', 'Canyon', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'Color', 'messages', 'were', 'never', 'present', 'episodes', 'first', 'place', 'think', 'practice', 'had', 'been', 'abandoned', 'start', '1971-72', 'seasons', 'TV', 'shows', 'All', 'Family', 'DVD', 'box', 'sets', 'only', 'Season', 'One', 'Spring', '1971', 'Color', 'message', 'Season', 'Two', 'Fall', '1971-Spring', '1972', 'did', 'NOT', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ANY', 'shows', 'had', 'time', 'Color', 'television', 'had', 'been', 'long', 'enough', 'point', 'continuing', 'brag', 'shows', 'being', 'Color', 'would', 'have', 'tended', 'be', 'overkill', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'swear', 'really', 'think', 'are', 'not', 'missing', 'were', 'likely', 'never', 'all.As', 'missing', 'cast', 'boxes', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'maybe', 'particular', 'episodes', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'completely', 'guess', 'part', 'episodes', 'were', 'different', 'nature', 'other', 'single', 'part', 'episodes', 'maybe', 'practice', 'was', 'not', 'used', 'could', 'be', 'completely', 'wrong', 'be', 'real', 'possibility', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'remember', 'sure', 'had', 'boxes', 'original', 'airing', 'was', 'BORN', 'right', 'time', 'season', 'wrapped', 'obviously', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'first-run', 'have', 'clue', 'syndicated', 'reruns', 'watched', 'late', '1970', 'had', 'cast', 'boxes', 'episodes', 'not', 'Can', 'anyone', 'say', 'absolute', 'certainty', 'boxes', 'DID', 'exist', 'episodes', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'box', 'set', 'just', 'reasons', 'alone', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'anything', 'be', 'missing', 'TV', 'show', 'box', 'other', 'reviews', 'will', 'attest', 'case', 'even', 'two', 'items', 'did', 'exist', 'one', 'time', 'are', 'fact', 'missing', 'here', 'what', 'here', 'far', 'outweighs', 'particular', 'items', 'Buy', 'box', 'set', 'like', 'Brady', 'Bunch', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",The Brady Bunch - The Complete Third Season

By the fourth episode Greg is ""wheeling and dealing"" for a new car, continued by the Brady family getting chosen for a TV commercial, Jan getting glasses, and the kids begin their singing career (even though Peter's voice is changing).  The scripts are fresh and entertaining, the kids have some of their best moments in this season with Jan overcoming ""her sister's shadow,"" also meeting her Aunt Jenny which has comic appeal with the nuttiness of Emogene Coacoa.  Marcia dates Greg's arch rival Warren Maloney, and Greg dates Marcia's arch rival Cathy.  And the battle of the ""little kids"" with Bobby tired of being a ""shrimpo"" and a ""pee-wee,"" and Bobby and Cindy both setting out to show ""little kids can do important things too"" as they attempt to set a new ""teeter-totter"" record.

Both are encouraged to like themselves for being who they are instead of trying to become somebody else. You cannot have other people like you unless you do not first like yourself.In the 3-part Grand Canyon adventure opening this season, Bobby and Cindy become lost from their family on a camping trip.  They meet up with Jimmy, a young Indian (Michael Campo). Jimmy is also running away from his family because he feels isolated by his grandfather's expectations. In return for helping them get safely back to Camp Brady, Jimmy receives food from Bobby and Cindy. All of these kids panic when they are discovered, but all ends well for everybody.""In Big Little Man"" Bobby embarks on a quest to become physically bigger. When this does not work with the speed which he had originally preferred, Bobby sets out to become a mental giant instead. ""Mr. Brady"" himself---Robert Reed---directs this episode.Finally ""Cindy Brady, Lady"" shows Bobby having a friend of his play `secret admirer' to his forlorn sister. Cindy is upset at having to be the youngest sibling in the family.  Bobby's action is really sweet specifically because I don't know of many brothers (including my own) who actually would think of doing this. Then again, it could be Bobby's empathy from his own age issues.We also continue dealing with Jan's ongoing psychological issues mentioned during the previous seasons.Jan is trying out for pom pom girl (""Her Sisters Shadow"") so that her teachers will stop comparing her to `Marcia..Marcia..Marcia'. Even though Jan fails to be picked, it shows her determination to exercise an `independent streak' when being a copy-cat of Marcia would have been so much easier. Anybody can relate to always being compared to somebody whom you are not.Jan then learns that real beauty is inside a person when she meets her Aunt Jenny (Imogene Coco) in ""Jan's Aunt Jenny"". Because they had looked a lot alike in her childhood photographs, Jan is worried that she will look just like Aunt Jenny now does when she is older. Yet talking with Aunt Jenny subsequently gives Jan a new perspective---somebody else knows about the issues she is now going through. Coco was a really big star so Paramount's ability to snag her for a guest appearance demonstrates the clout which this series had gained.The Brady Bunch again proves why it sticks in the American psyche with this season. Many episodes delivered memorable social statements on tolerance, individuality, and identity without nagging to their audience.",5,Bobby and Cindy get their own time in this `Bunch' of  episodes,1122681600,"07 30, 2005",2005,2888,"['eldest', 'siblings', 'Marcia', 'Greg', 'quickly', 'approaching', 'respective', 'heights', 'groovyness', 'ignoring', 'younger', 'less', 'popular', 'Brady', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'easy', 'scripting', 'department', 'point', ""'Brady"", 'Bunch', 'series.Instead', 'many', 'episodes', '23-episode', '1971-1972', 'season', 'pointedly', 'explore', 'Cindy', 'Bobby', 'quest', 'fit', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'encouraged', 'like', 'being', 'who', 'are', 'instead', 'trying', 'become', 'somebody', 'else', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'other', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'first', 'yourself.In', '3-part', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'adventure', 'opening', 'season', 'Bobby', 'Cindy', 'become', 'lost', 'family', 'camping', 'trip', 'meet', 'up', 'Jimmy', 'young', 'Indian', 'Michael', 'Campo', 'Jimmy', 'also', 'running', 'away', 'family', 'isolated', 'grandfather', 'expectations', 'return', 'helping', 'get', 'safely', 'back', 'Camp', 'Brady', 'Jimmy', 'food', 'Bobby', 'Cindy', 'kids', 'panic', 'when', 'are', 'discovered', 'well', 'everybody', 'Big', 'Little', 'Man', 'Bobby', 'quest', 'become', 'physically', 'bigger', 'When', 'not', 'work', 'speed', 'had', 'originally', 'preferred', 'Bobby', 'out', 'become', 'mental', 'giant', 'instead', 'Mr.', 'Brady', '-Robert', 'Reed', 'episode.Finally', 'Cindy', 'Brady', 'Lady', 'Bobby', 'having', 'friend', 'play', 'secret', 'admirer', 'forlorn', 'sister', 'Cindy', 'upset', 'having', 'be', 'youngest', 'sibling', 'family', 'Bobby', 'action', 'really', 'sweet', 'specifically', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'many', 'brothers', 'including', 'own', 'who', 'actually', 'would', 'think', 'doing', 'Then', 'again', 'could', 'be', 'Bobby', 'empathy', 'own', 'age', 'issues.We', 'also', 'continue', 'dealing', 'Jan', 'ongoing', 'psychological', 'issues', 'mentioned', 'previous', 'seasons.Jan', 'trying', 'out', 'pom', 'pom', 'girl', 'Sisters', 'Shadow', 'teachers', 'will', 'stop', 'comparing', 'Marcia..Marcia..Marcia', 'Even', 'Jan', 'be', 'picked', 'determination', 'exercise', 'independent', 'streak', 'when', 'being', 'copy-cat', 'Marcia', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'easier', 'Anybody', 'can', 'relate', 'always', 'being', 'compared', 'somebody', 'whom', 'are', 'not.Jan', 'then', 'real', 'beauty', 'person', 'when', 'Aunt', 'Jenny', 'Imogene', 'Coco', 'Jan', 'Aunt', 'Jenny', 'had', 'looked', 'lot', 'alike', 'childhood', 'photographs', 'Jan', 'worried', 'will', 'look', 'just', 'Aunt', 'Jenny', 'now', 'when', 'older', 'talking', 'Aunt', 'Jenny', 'subsequently', 'Jan', 'new', 'perspective', '-somebody', 'else', 'issues', 'now', 'going', 'Coco', 'was', 'really', 'big', 'star', 'Paramount', 'ability', 'snag', 'guest', 'appearance', 'clout', 'series', 'had', 'gained.The', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'again', 'why', 'American', 'psyche', 'season', 'Many', 'episodes', 'delivered', 'memorable', 'social', 'statements', 'tolerance', 'individuality', 'identity', 'nagging', 'audience']",The Brady Bunch - The Complete Third Season
