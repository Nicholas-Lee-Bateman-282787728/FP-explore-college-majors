I got the feeling we were being hurried over a lot of things and others were left out.  However, this is the first movie about the Kennedys that put forward the idea that Jack married Jackie pretty much because it was time he got married according to his father and she happened to be the society girl in his life at the time.  The undertones of why she was attracted to him lies, I think, in his resemblance to her father in manner and behavior.  Joanne Walley gives a rather boring, one dimensional performance.  She isn't tall enough or thin enough for the role and I don't think she really conveyed Jackie's soft voiced charm. That was always the first thing I noticed about Jackie Kennedy - that little girl almost breathless voice. Tim Matheson does not fit the role of JFK. He appears too old right from the first scenes. The hair isn't right and his performance is also one dimensional and boring.It's certainly not the worst movie I've ever seen about the Kennedys but it's not very good. Of course Tom Skerritt is wonderful as always but doesn't quite get the accent. Baker is embarassing as Rose. Not enough to do and didn't do much with what she was given.  I keep wondering when Amazon is going to offer the excellent 6 part series ""The Kennedys of Massachusetts"" on DVD.

1504286,A11DSVTOJO61A8,B005VUTRGW,Leslie,"[0, 0]","When Jackie Bouvier met John Kennedy she had no intentions of marrying Jack in the least, but decided to marry him after he proposed to her.Joanne Whalley did an outstanding performance of portraying the most prominent First Lady in America, and with Tim Matherson (John F. Kennedy) by her side, the saga of Camelot began.Watching this dvd I can not but wonder about their marriage, as I got the impression that it was no different from the millions of other marriages of the time. Jacqueline married for love, suffered her husband's career, fell out of love because Jack was never home for her. His womanizing and drinking was made public because of his very public life.John's career became more and more important to him than his wife, and without noticing, his life with his beautiful wife was falling apart. His career was pushed by his father's ambitions, as his career was ended, so pushed his sons to do what he could not accomplish.Jacqueline was a loyal, committed, caring and supportive woman who loved her husband despite what she knew was going on in his own private life. She was a very strong and determined woman.As a child she was born into privilege, but a broken home gave her the strength to later endure more than most. While her often heartbroken marriage to John F. Kennedy made her want to say, ""No more"", her strength and intelligence made her strive to keep it together, without the help of her husband.She endeared herself to a nation, and in some respects and her many admirers worldwide, and in the days that followed her husband's assassination in Dallas, most peoples' hearts went out to her as she came to grips with what happened.It sounds like any marriage to me, but it had an entire nation, and the world as it's stage. What marriage could possibly survive the public for that long? It is hard for a woman to bury a husband she loved, despite his failings, so imagine the pain she had to endure as a world turned out to share their pain with her.With the help of family she prevailed, and by a chance, met an old friend Aristotle Onassis, whose friendship turned to her. With the assassination of Robert, Jacqueline, I believe, was pushed and eventually fell for Aristotle.Tragedy struck again with the death of Aristotle's son, Alexander, and her divorce to Aristotle.Towards the end of her life she said that she was so blessed despite all the loneliness and tragedy, she found love in her old and dear friend Maurice, that she had found nowhere else.Jacqueline's story is one of the many stories women have to endure during their lives, and yet survive admit the turmoil to walk out the other end stronger for the experience. But to be in the public limelight most of her life, especially since that day in Dallas, would have put so much more burden on her shoulders than most people could carry.This dvd is definitely five star material, and I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in a bit more of the story that was Camelot, and a lady who endured much.",5,The Life of Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,3005,"['When', 'Jackie', 'Bouvier', 'met', 'John', 'Kennedy', 'had', 'intentions', 'marrying', 'Jack', 'least', 'decided', 'marry', 'proposed', 'her.Joanne', 'Whalley', 'did', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'portraying', 'most', 'prominent', 'First', 'Lady', 'America', 'Tim', 'Matherson', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'side', 'saga', 'Camelot', 'began.Watching', 'dvd', 'can', 'not', 'wonder', 'marriage', 'got', 'impression', 'was', 'different', 'millions', 'other', 'marriages', 'time', 'Jacqueline', 'married', 'love', 'suffered', 'husband', 'career', 'fell', 'love', 'Jack', 'was', 'never', 'home', 'womanizing', 'drinking', 'was', 'made', 'public', 'very', 'public', 'life.John', 'career', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'important', 'wife', 'noticing', 'life', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'was', 'falling', 'apart', 'career', 'was', 'pushed', 'father', 'ambitions', 'career', 'was', 'ended', 'so', 'pushed', 'sons', 'do', 'what', 'could', 'not', 'accomplish.Jacqueline', 'was', 'loyal', 'committed', 'caring', 'supportive', 'woman', 'who', 'loved', 'husband', 'what', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'own', 'private', 'life', 'was', 'very', 'strong', 'determined', 'woman.As', 'child', 'was', 'born', 'privilege', 'broken', 'home', 'gave', 'strength', 'later', 'endure', 'more', 'most', 'often', 'heartbroken', 'marriage', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'made', 'want', 'say', 'more', 'strength', 'intelligence', 'made', 'strive', 'keep', 'together', 'help', 'husband.She', 'endeared', 'nation', 'respects', 'many', 'admirers', 'worldwide', 'days', 'followed', 'husband', 'assassination', 'Dallas', 'most', 'peoples', 'hearts', 'went', 'came', 'grips', 'what', 'happened.It', 'sounds', 'marriage', 'had', 'entire', 'nation', 'world', 'stage', 'What', 'marriage', 'could', 'possibly', 'survive', 'public', 'long', 'hard', 'woman', 'bury', 'husband', 'loved', 'failings', 'so', 'imagine', 'pain', 'had', 'endure', 'world', 'turned', 'out', 'share', 'pain', 'help', 'family', 'prevailed', 'chance', 'met', 'old', 'friend', 'Aristotle', 'Onassis', 'friendship', 'turned', 'assassination', 'Robert', 'Jacqueline', 'believe', 'was', 'pushed', 'eventually', 'fell', 'Aristotle.Tragedy', 'struck', 'again', 'death', 'Aristotle', 'son', 'Alexander', 'divorce', 'Aristotle.Towards', 'end', 'life', 'said', 'was', 'so', 'blessed', 'loneliness', 'tragedy', 'found', 'love', 'old', 'dear', 'friend', 'Maurice', 'had', 'found', 'nowhere', 'else.Jacqueline', 'story', 'one', 'many', 'stories', 'women', 'have', 'endure', 'lives', 'yet', 'survive', 'admit', 'turmoil', 'walk', 'other', 'end', 'stronger', 'experience', 'be', 'public', 'limelight', 'most', 'life', 'especially', 'day', 'Dallas', 'would', 'have', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'burden', 'shoulders', 'most', 'people', 'could', 'carry.This', 'dvd', 'definitely', 'five', 'star', 'material', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'bit', 'more', 'story', 'was', 'Camelot', 'lady', 'who', 'endured', 'much']",Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis

It has never been advertised or represented as a documentary and while many aspects of her life are either dramatized or shoved to the side, Joanne Whalley does carry herself off well as Jackie throughout the years.  Using a combination of tenacity and tenderness, she shows us the ups and downs of a life lived mainly (though mostly unwillingly) in the public eye.  The real Mrs. Onassis was a tall woman, but Joanne Whalley carries herself with true style, bringing forth a portrayal of an American icon with style, sophistication and wit.
