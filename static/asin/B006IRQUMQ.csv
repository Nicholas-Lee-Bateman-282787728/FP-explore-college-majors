1515777,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B006IRQUMQ,Enjolras,"[1, 2]","The concept behind this movie has a lot of potential. I love the idea of a time traveler meeting the love of his life in the past. However, this is a made-for-TV movie and it shows. The acting is doesn't convey any emotion at all - a problem for a love story. This is especially damaging because with such a far fetched plot, the emotion needs to be all the more real to convince viewers that the two are in love. However, what really drags this movie down is that it goes by way to quickly. It is about 1 hour 20 minutes, about average length for romantic comedies, but it seems like very little happens during that time. At least very little that's memorable. I guess I shouldn't expect to much. The movie certainly works as a date movie, but for such a cool idea for a romantic comedy it's too bad the director didn't get more out of it.",3,"has potential, but...",1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,840,"['concept', 'movie', 'lot', 'potential', 'love', 'idea', 'time', 'traveler', 'meeting', 'love', 'life', 'past', 'However', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'acting', ""n't"", 'convey', 'emotion', 'problem', 'love', 'story', 'especially', 'damaging', 'far', 'fetched', 'plot', 'emotion', 'be', 'more', 'real', 'convince', 'viewers', 'two', 'are', 'love', 'However', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'down', 'way', 'quickly', '1', 'hour', '20', 'minutes', 'about', 'average', 'length', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'very', 'little', 'happens', 'time', 'least', 'very', 'little', 'memorable', 'guess', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'movie', 'certainly', 'date', 'movie', 'such', 'cool', 'idea', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'too', 'bad', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'more']",My Future Boyfriend

Willard saves the day with his goofy presence in this slow starting, sit-com-like romantic comedy.It begins with an excavation during the 32nd Century of an ancient site.  The hero finds a paperback, romance novel which mentions love, passion, lust, and sex- unknown, forbidden terms in his sanitary world.  With the help of his colleague(Willard), he travels back to our time to find the author and discover the meaning of love.  Catch is: he has only 48 hours to do it.The author works as a journalist, and is, of course, soon to be engaged to a man that's not right for her.  She's given the assignment to interview and write a human interest story about this guy who claims to be from the future.  Yes, we know where this is headed.  There's fun and romance as the time traveler is a fish out of water and an innocent to our ways and the ways of love.There's some cute and hilarious scenes that redeem this flick.  There's definitely not much meat on it, but that's OK.  Family friendly, but the kids will be bored.  It says PG-13 on this page, but I don't know why?
