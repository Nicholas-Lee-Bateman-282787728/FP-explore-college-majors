It doesn't have the same interesting thrill that RI has. He is basically just competing against a contrived set of circumstances and &#34;winning&#34; by making a decent meal under horrendous conditions. It is fun and worth watching, but if you are expecting it to be as good as RI you will be disappointed.",4,"Good, but not great",1400803200,"05 23, 2014",2014,397,"['Dinner', 'Impossible', 'was', 'Robert', 'Irvine', 'first', 'series', 'Restaurant', 'Impossible', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'interesting', 'thrill', 'RI', 'basically', 'just', 'competing', 'contrived', 'set', 'circumstances', '34', 'winning', '34', 'making', 'decent', 'meal', 'horrendous', 'conditions', 'fun', 'worth', 'watching', 'are', 'expecting', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'RI', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed']",Dinner: Impossible: Season 1
