1362266,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B003TNS3D6,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[12, 13]","Mario Lopez and his co-stars, B/Teen-movie queen Jamie Pressly and Richard Grieco should have had a long talk with their agents, asking ""WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??"" by getting them involved in this disaster. Lopez had already gotten favorable reviews for his acting in ""Breaking the Surface"" by the time he shot this, and this was several steps backward, to his ""Bell"" days.Lopez plays Ryan Murphy, a cadet at a military training ""academy"" in the dark barren and frozen country that was once the USA, before it was wiped out (along with most of the earth and its inhabitants) by a meteor a couple of decades earlier. The academy, training hunky young men to protect the ""New America"" (from what, it isn't exactly clear), is headed up by the self-described ""hardass"" Sgt Bradley (overplayed with a perpetual grimace by Grieco), who puts the best of his troops through special training (and on a diet of steroids) to be part of something called the ""Z-Team"", which is actually his creation to help the aliens who first tried to destroy earth to come and take it over. (If you are shaking your head saying ""Whaaaat?"", be assured it is not any clearer when you are watching it.)Now I'll admit I am a fan of really BAD science fiction films, but this one doesn't even deserve to be considered part of that genre. The story has holes in it you can pass a meteor through, the dialogue could not be any more predictable if that was your goal, a special effects budget I'd estimate at about two bucks, plot developments that make no sense whatsoever, and overacting runs rampant. Much of the dialogue seems ad-libbed, such as Grieco's frequent exclamations of ""For Pete's sake"" which are ludicrous for his character. However, since the film is directed by David DeCocteau (known for his schlocky quasi-horror films that uniformly feature hunky young guys in boxer briefs), you know you'll see Mario and his fellow cadets in their ""tighty whities.""What about Jamie Pressly? She plays a prostitute, one of two who are somehow allowed to roam freely through the academy. Considering most of the scenes with them are simply watching her friend dance topless while the boys hug each other or burn each other with cigars (Never mind the fact that they're all stripped to their boxer briefs), it's obvious the only reason they are there is to avoid assumptions that the soldiers of the future are all gay. Don't ask, don't tell, indeed!  There is one sex scene between Pressly and Lopez, in which Lopez manages to keep his white boxer-briefs on so long it is almost laughable.Very brief shot of rear nudity.I could go on and on about the stupidity in this film (why the locker room has hundreds of lockers, when it is apparent the academy holds maybe 20-25 guys at most; how Lopez and Pressly can OUTRUN an explosion, especially since they pause mid-run several times to look back at it; and how they had the nerve to use what looks like a standard web camera as the ""alien communication device"" Grieco uses). Suffice it to say that the only reasons to see this film might be (1) if you are obsessed with Mario Lopez, (2) you enjoy seeing a dozen or so hunky young men in their boxer briefs, or (3) ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" was just too intelligent for you to follow!",1,There's a reason this took *13 years* to make it to DVD!,1289520000,"11 12, 2010",2010,3256,"['Mario', 'Lopez', 'co-stars', 'B/Teen-movie', 'queen', 'Jamie', 'Pressly', 'Richard', 'Grieco', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'long', 'talk', 'agents', 'asking', 'WHAT', 'WERE', 'YOU', 'THINKING', 'getting', 'involved', 'disaster', 'Lopez', 'had', 'already', 'gotten', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'acting', 'Breaking', 'Surface', 'time', 'shot', 'was', 'several', 'steps', 'backward', 'Bell', 'days.Lopez', 'Ryan', 'Murphy', 'cadet', 'military', 'training', 'academy', 'dark', 'barren', 'frozen', 'country', 'was', 'once', 'USA', 'was', 'wiped', 'out', 'most', 'earth', 'inhabitants', 'meteor', 'couple', 'decades', 'earlier', 'academy', 'training', 'hunky', 'young', 'men', 'protect', 'New', 'America', 'what', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'clear', 'headed', 'up', 'self-described', 'hardass', 'Sgt', 'Bradley', 'overplayed', 'perpetual', 'grimace', 'Grieco', 'who', 'best', 'troops', 'special', 'training', 'diet', 'steroids', 'be', 'part', 'something', 'called', 'Z-Team', 'actually', 'creation', 'help', 'aliens', 'who', 'first', 'tried', 'destroy', 'earth', 'come', 'take', 'over', 'are', 'shaking', 'head', 'saying', 'Whaaaat', 'be', 'assured', 'not', 'clearer', 'when', 'are', 'watching', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'am', 'fan', 'really', 'BAD', 'science', 'fiction', 'films', 'one', ""n't"", 'even', 'deserve', 'be', 'considered', 'part', 'genre', 'story', 'holes', 'can', 'pass', 'meteor', 'dialogue', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'predictable', 'was', 'goal', 'special', 'effects', 'budget', ""'d"", 'estimate', 'about', 'two', 'bucks', 'plot', 'developments', 'make', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'overacting', 'runs', 'rampant', 'Much', 'dialogue', 'ad-libbed', 'such', 'Grieco', 'frequent', 'exclamations', 'Pete', 'sake', 'are', 'ludicrous', 'character', 'However', 'film', 'directed', 'David', 'DeCocteau', 'known', 'schlocky', 'quasi-horror', 'films', 'uniformly', 'feature', 'hunky', 'young', 'guys', 'boxer', 'briefs', 'know', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Mario', 'fellow', 'cadets', 'tighty', 'whities', 'What', 'Jamie', 'Pressly', 'prostitute', 'one', 'two', 'who', 'are', 'somehow', 'allowed', 'roam', 'freely', 'academy', 'Considering', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'simply', 'watching', 'friend', 'dance', 'topless', 'boys', 'hug', 'other', 'burn', 'other', 'cigars', 'Never', 'mind', 'fact', ""'re"", 'stripped', 'boxer', 'briefs', 'obvious', 'only', 'reason', 'are', 'avoid', 'assumptions', 'soldiers', 'future', 'are', 'gay', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'indeed', 'one', 'sex', 'scene', 'Pressly', 'Lopez', 'Lopez', 'keep', 'white', 'boxer-briefs', 'long', 'almost', 'laughable.Very', 'brief', 'shot', 'rear', 'nudity.I', 'could', 'go', 'stupidity', 'film', 'why', 'locker', 'room', 'hundreds', 'lockers', 'when', 'apparent', 'academy', 'maybe', '20-25', 'guys', 'most', 'how', 'Lopez', 'Pressly', 'can', 'OUTRUN', 'explosion', 'especially', 'pause', 'mid-run', 'several', 'times', 'look', 'back', 'how', 'had', 'nerve', 'use', 'what', 'standard', 'web', 'camera', 'alien', 'communication', 'device', 'Grieco', 'Suffice', 'say', 'only', 'reasons', 'see', 'film', 'might', 'be', '1', 'are', 'obsessed', 'Mario', 'Lopez', '2', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'dozen', 'so', 'hunky', 'young', 'men', 'boxer', 'briefs', '3', 'Attack', 'Killer', 'Tomatoes', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'intelligent', 'follow']",N/A

Now there seems to be people living in other areas, but we never get a feel for that. Ryan Murphy (Mario Lopez) shows up at this boot camp because his friend is missing plus there are odd things going on. (I liked this plot better when it involved prison girls.) Richard Grieco plays a psychotic Sargent, who idolizes Nixon. Murphy is assigned to Echo Group and immediately doesn't fit in. Somehow pretty females are allowed to go into the cadet's barracks for drunken comfort sessions including Jamie Pressly who makes love to Ryan Murphy on his extra wide army cot. It is nudity which deserves four stars, but the movie stank so bad I could only muster 2 stars in spite of Jamie's perky effort.
