1216504,A6OLSZ3I3Q01I,B001M9ELV2,"Charles Paxton Martin ""Paxton in Spain""","[1, 1]","Curiously, in some reviews I read in a Spanish film website, most people give this a thumbs-down. I live in Spain and speak Spanish, and generally avoid films made-in-Spain, because they are usually depressing (or silly). This film is a minor gem, very daring in its subject matter, and with interesting actors. Flora Martinez is great, and the rest of the ladies are very well ""fleshed out,"" but it is the fascinating performance by Eduardo Noriega that really stands out for me... performances, really, because he brings to life two drastically different brothers, as described in other posts here. You'll want to see the ""making-of"" too. This shows how the director, Vicente Aranda, uses his presumably limited budget in a totally professional and imaginative way. This is a director worth seeking out (Juana la Loca / Mad Love, Lovers... because he treads where no other serious director dares, and, finally,  makes you care even about the totally amoral anti-hero.",4,"Too strong for some people, but an excellent film",1317168000,"09 28, 2011",2011,969,"['Curiously', 'reviews', 'read', 'Spanish', 'film', 'website', 'most', 'people', 'give', 'thumbs-down', 'live', 'Spain', 'speak', 'Spanish', 'generally', 'avoid', 'films', 'made-in-Spain', 'are', 'usually', 'depressing', 'silly', 'film', 'minor', 'gem', 'very', 'daring', 'subject', 'matter', 'interesting', 'actors', 'Flora', 'Martinez', 'great', 'rest', 'ladies', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'fleshed', 'out', 'fascinating', 'performance', 'Eduardo', 'Noriega', 'really', 'out', 'performances', 'really', 'life', 'two', 'drastically', 'different', 'brothers', 'described', 'other', 'posts', 'here', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'making-of', 'too', 'how', 'director', 'Vicente', 'Aranda', 'presumably', 'limited', 'budget', 'totally', 'professional', 'imaginative', 'way', 'director', 'seeking', 'out', 'Juana', 'la', 'Loca', '/', 'Mad', 'Love', 'Lovers', 'where', 'other', 'serious', 'director', 'dares', 'finally', 'care', 'even', 'totally', 'amoral', 'anti-hero']",Lolita's Club

1216507,A1P7R1Z7BQ5HCL,B001M9ELV2,Ian Hunter,"[4, 4]","The central protagonist is a policeman. He injures two motorcyclists who are harassing two Muslim women and a child. It transpires that the attackers have powerful parents, connected to ETA; the Basque separatist group; one money-making venture turning out to be sex clubs. The policeman is sent on unpaid leave, pending an investigation into his `intervention' and for his own safety. He goes home. The poignancy in this film is that the first thing he wants to do on arrival is to see his brother Valentin. It's poignant because he is ""a mental retard"" according to his embittered father. In current language, he might be classified as a highly functioning ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder) sufferer. He finds his brother, doing menial tasks, in a sex club! This is only scene setting. It weaves in three strands of tension; Raul's love for his brother, ETA's hunt for the policeman and Lolita's Club! For anyone who copes with a disability in the close or distant family, this is a film to watch, just for that. The sex is good too but that's secondary to the love that motivates Raul's behaviour. It is a beautifully constructed film.Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'.",5,"Police, sex and poignant",1300406400,"03 18, 2011",2011,1167,"['central', 'protagonist', 'policeman', 'two', 'motorcyclists', 'who', 'are', 'harassing', 'two', 'Muslim', 'women', 'child', 'attackers', 'have', 'powerful', 'parents', 'connected', 'ETA', 'Basque', 'separatist', 'group', 'one', 'money-making', 'venture', 'turning', 'out', 'be', 'sex', 'clubs', 'policeman', 'sent', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'pending', 'investigation', 'intervention', 'own', 'safety', 'home', 'poignancy', 'film', 'first', 'thing', 'do', 'arrival', 'see', 'brother', 'Valentin', 'poignant', 'mental', 'retard', 'according', 'embittered', 'father', 'current', 'language', 'might', 'be', 'classified', 'highly', 'functioning', 'ASD', 'Autistic', 'Spectrum', 'Disorder', 'sufferer', 'brother', 'doing', 'menial', 'tasks', 'sex', 'club', 'only', 'scene', 'setting', 'three', 'strands', 'tension', 'Raul', 'love', 'brother', 'ETA', 'hunt', 'policeman', 'Lolita', 'Club', 'anyone', 'who', 'disability', 'close', 'distant', 'family', 'film', 'watch', 'just', 'sex', 'good', 'too', 'secondary', 'love', 'Raul', 'behaviour', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'film.Ian', 'Hunter.Author', 'e-Love']",Lolita's Club
