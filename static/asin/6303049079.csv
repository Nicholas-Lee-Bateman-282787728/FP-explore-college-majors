Unfortunately, he doesn't end up being with his wife, but these things happen sometimes. I love how his gay brother and his lover try to find him the perfect mask for the job.

Mrs. Doubtfire is about a man who gets divorced but really loves his kids, and goes to extremes to be with them. What does he doe? He pretends to be a maid by dressing up as an old lady. Robin does a great job of playing Mrs. Doubtfire, and changing roles.I loved this movie. Robin Williams does a great job at playing two people. It's really amazing how he can switch voices (everything from Gandi to a Mafia thug to an old lady, Mrs. Doubtfire). It's really a hilarious movie, and although it's a little old, it's a classic. It was so funny and is suitable for both kids and adults.

353172,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6303049079,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Robin Williams is the king of the slapstick comedy.  He just knows how to move his body and alter his voice and play to every one of his strengths.  That isn't to say that every one of his films works, but he has a knack for creating these characters we can't help but love.Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire is one of those characters.Personally, I love this film in all of its silly, schmaltzy ridiculousness.  It is fun and entertaining and heartwarming on many levels.  After Daniel Hillard's reckless behavior moves his uptight yet overworked wife Miranda to push for separation, he feels overwhelmed by the lack of time he is allowed to see his children.  Miranda is unmoved by his pleas, since she considers him incapable of taking care of them.  So, he resorts to a last ditch effort, which seems to work.  He undergoes extensive `creature makeup' to become a woman.  He becomes Mrs. Doubtfire, a strict, fun loving house keeper hired by Miranda to watch the kids while she is at work or out on the town with her new boyfriend, the suave Stu Denmeyer.Williams is hilarious as Daniel, capturing more than a mere gimmick (sure, he plays up the gimmick for sure) but actually infusing so much heart and humanity into his portrayal.  You believe his every plea, and when he breaks down about the love he has for his kids and the need he has to see them, your heart breaks.  Field, Brosnan, Lawrence, Jakub and Wilson are also great here, adding to a collectively effective ensemble.  The makeup is believable and hilarious, and the gags feel fresh even during the fiftieth viewing.  This is a film that warrants multiple viewings, not because it is required to understand the film but because it is just so much fun!Not to mention the fact that it's given us a slew of glorious catch-phrases!",5,Don't doubt Williams; he knows how to deliver...,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,1787,"['Robin', 'Williams', 'king', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'just', 'how', 'move', 'body', 'alter', 'voice', 'play', 'one', 'strengths', ""n't"", 'say', 'one', 'films', 'works', 'knack', 'creating', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love.Mrs', 'Euphegenia', 'Doubtfire', 'one', 'characters.Personally', 'love', 'film', 'silly', 'schmaltzy', 'ridiculousness', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'heartwarming', 'many', 'levels', 'Daniel', 'Hillard', 'reckless', 'behavior', 'uptight', 'yet', 'overworked', 'wife', 'Miranda', 'push', 'separation', 'overwhelmed', 'lack', 'time', 'allowed', 'see', 'children', 'Miranda', 'unmoved', 'pleas', 'incapable', 'taking', 'care', 'So', 'last', 'ditch', 'effort', 'work', 'extensive', 'creature', 'makeup', 'become', 'woman', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'strict', 'fun', 'loving', 'house', 'keeper', 'hired', 'Miranda', 'watch', 'kids', 'work', 'town', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'suave', 'Stu', 'Denmeyer.Williams', 'hilarious', 'Daniel', 'capturing', 'more', 'mere', 'gimmick', 'sure', 'up', 'gimmick', 'sure', 'actually', 'infusing', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'humanity', 'portrayal', 'believe', 'plea', 'when', 'down', 'love', 'kids', 'need', 'see', 'heart', 'breaks', 'Field', 'Brosnan', 'Lawrence', 'Jakub', 'Wilson', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'here', 'adding', 'collectively', 'effective', 'ensemble', 'makeup', 'believable', 'hilarious', 'gags', 'feel', 'fresh', 'even', 'fiftieth', 'viewing', 'film', 'warrants', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'not', 'required', 'understand', 'film', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'given', 'slew', 'glorious', 'catch-phrases']",Mrs Doubtfire VHS

So in the divorce court,Miranda is granted full custody of the couple's three children until unemployed Daniel finds work and a new home in a thirty-day period. However,Daniel is granted visitation rights every Saturday in that period. So Miranda hires a nanny and guess who responded to the want ad? Daniel! So Daniel,in drag as a senior citizen woman,becomes MRS. DOUBTFIRE. One funny scene is when ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is cooking in the kitchen,he says,""My first day as a woman,and already I'm having hot flashes!"". Eventually,Daniel blows his disguise,shocking Miranda. The children,although they learned it was their father as MRS. DOUBTFIRE,appreciated his act. Afterall,Daniel loved his children too much to not be without them.

353177,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6303049079,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","I love Robin Williams, and this is a good example of why. Daniel Hillard (Williams) is doing the voices -- all the voices -- for a cartoon as the movie begins. The canary has been singing Figaro, the cat catches him, and rather than permit him a phone call as he requests, offers him a last cigarette. Hillard ad-libs an anti-smoking message for the canary, and the director is furious. Hillard points out that as a cartoon, it is aimed at children, and promoting smoking on a children's movie is unethical. He's told to do the script the way it was written or take a hike. He takes the latter option.So he's home early, can create a birthday party for his son, and make enough mess for his wife Miranda (Sally Field) to blow her top and ask for a divorce. Well, he did make quite an awful mess, but really!Anyway, once she's kicked him out, and gotten custody of the three children, and a court order that Daddy sees them only on Saturdays, she needs a housekeeper. After all, she's a successful career woman and can't do everything herself. However, she has the ad copy with her when she comes to pick up the kids at his chaotic apartment, and he manages to change a couple of numbers so that she gets no legitimate calls. Then he calls with a variety of fake voices and successfully creates the impression that only seriously unsuitable people are answering the ad. Then he calls and makes an appointment for an interview for Mrs. Doubtfire.Fortunately, Daniel's brother is a theatrical makeup artist, really very good at it, and after half a dozen hilarious attempts, comes up with just the right transformation into the dumpy but lovable British Mrs. Doubtfire. Of course she is hired.No, I have not told you too much. This is just the background to the funniest situation you can imagine.

As the perfect ""straight man"" to the best of the jokes Pierce Brosnan plays Stuart, an old boyfriend of Miranda's who comes back into her life and seems prepared to settle down with the whole family.

353179,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,6303049079,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[5, 7]","This quiet and unassuming movie stormed movie theaters back in the winter of 1993. I don't think anybody had any idea that it would explode into the behemoth smash that it became. It was well deserved. Director Chris Columbus(Home Alone, Harry Potter) directed this charming tale which stars Robin Williams. Robin plays Daniel Hillard, a man who specializes in voice over work for cartoons. He has a wife and three kids. Daniel's world comes crashing down when his wife Miranda(Sally Field)announces that she wants a divorce. Daniel packs his things and moves out of their nice San Francisco home. Daniel is so depressed that he can't see his kids as often anymore, so he sets out to change that. He goes to his make up artist brother(played by Harvey Fierstein)and creates the disguise of an elderly british woman named Mrs. Doubtfire. He applies for the nanny job his wife is hiring for and gets it. From then on, it's madcap situations as Daniel tries to be a part of his family again and to keep his identity a secret from everyone. Williams is a master. What can I say?. They broke the mold when they made him. This is one of his most impressive performances. Ranging from slapstick goofy to seriously emotional drama. Sally Field, while good, seems to have nothing to do but to look sad. Doesn't it look like her mouth is shaped in the form of a frown?. The supporting cast includes Pierce Brosnan, Robert Prosky, and an uncredited cameo by Martin Mull. The movie, while hilariously funny, also shows how hard and emotional a break up and eventual divorce can be on a family. Even tho it is surrounded by funny stuff, it's a subject matter not to be taken lightly. Everyone here pulled it off and did a magnificent job. Mrs. Doubtfire is a movie to enjoy over and over again.",5,&quot;I'll Just Get The Frock Out Of Here....&quot;,1018137600,"04 7, 2002",2002,1781,"['quiet', 'unassuming', 'movie', 'stormed', 'movie', 'theaters', 'back', 'winter', '1993', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anybody', 'had', 'idea', 'would', 'explode', 'behemoth', 'smash', 'became', 'was', 'well', 'deserved', 'Director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'Home', 'Alone', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'directed', 'charming', 'tale', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Robin', 'Daniel', 'Hillard', 'man', 'who', 'voice', 'work', 'cartoons', 'wife', 'three', 'kids', 'Daniel', 'world', 'crashing', 'down', 'when', 'wife', 'Miranda', 'Sally', 'Field', 'divorce', 'Daniel', 'things', 'nice', 'San', 'Francisco', 'home', 'Daniel', 'so', 'depressed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'kids', 'often', 'anymore', 'out', 'change', 'make', 'up', 'artist', 'brother', 'played', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'disguise', 'elderly', 'british', 'woman', 'named', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'nanny', 'job', 'wife', 'hiring', 'then', 'madcap', 'situations', 'Daniel', 'be', 'part', 'family', 'again', 'keep', 'identity', 'secret', 'everyone', 'Williams', 'master', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'broke', 'mold', 'when', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'performances', 'Ranging', 'slapstick', 'goofy', 'seriously', 'emotional', 'drama', 'Sally', 'Field', 'good', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'look', 'sad', ""n't"", 'look', 'mouth', 'shaped', 'form', 'frown', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Robert', 'Prosky', 'uncredited', 'cameo', 'Martin', 'Mull', 'movie', 'hilariously', 'funny', 'also', 'how', 'hard', 'emotional', 'break', 'up', 'eventual', 'divorce', 'can', 'be', 'family', 'Even', 'surrounded', 'funny', 'stuff', 'subject', 'matter', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'Everyone', 'here', 'pulled', 'off', 'did', 'magnificent', 'job', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'over', 'again']",Mrs Doubtfire VHS
353180,A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y,6303049079,Ben Adam,"[3, 4]","Any teacher of script writing will use Mrs. Doubtfire as the perfect example of a plot that nobody can believe. What woman in today's America would hire a caretaker for her children in, of all places, San Francisco, Freak Central of the entire nation, by placing a classified ad in the newspaper and trying her luck with anyone who would respond? That only makes the wacky answers that Robin Williams in the role of alienated father and unemployed actor Daniel Hilliard gives to the ad totally believable, but it certainly casts quite a few doubts on the sort of mother that Miranda Hilliard (Sally Field) must be in leaving her three children with people she obtains in such a fashion! Then once the rather pachydermal Euphegenia Doubtfire, who is Daniel Hilliard in drag, thanks to the cosmetic genius of gay brother Frank (Harvey Fierstein), appears on her doorstep, without bothering to check out her background or references, she hires her on the basis of an initial conversation, not even detecting that this ""woman"" is the man she lived with for years in matrimony. Believable? Not on your life, but it makes for some great entertainment.Robin Williams is his usual manic comic genius, but Sally Field provides an excellent foil to his excessive manner. Aside from these two, however, the action is limited to none. The three children, Lydia (Lisa Jakub), Chris (Matthew Lawrence), and Nattie (Mara Wilson), play inconsequential children's roles in the film. Pierce Brosnan, as Miranda's old flame, Stu Dunmeyer, who turns up to be the threat to the place Daniel once occupied in her life, plays Pierce Brosnan with nothing spectacular to offer; he is there largely as an object to be attacked. Harvey Fierstein's appearance at the start of the film gives the film its push in the direction that it is inevitably to take -- into the cross-dressing arena -- but after that, the theme is dropped and not resumed.The film treats the topic of non-custodial parenting and joint parenting in a very kind way, far kinder than the reality that most non-custodial parents face in the real world, and the film ends very happily in a way that is charming and endearing. There is no mistaking that a person watching the film cannot help but come away with a good feeling -- everyone except a parent who has been so severely burned by family court that the parent has lost all rights. It is with that one caveat that I would recommend the movie to everyone without hesitation, as I am also a parent who has faced the horrors of family court and know how brutal it can be. As my son said to me as the divorce proceedings moved forward, ""Face it, Daddy, this isn't going to be like Mrs. Doubtfire."" It certainly wasn't, but with time, my children stood up to their mother and to the court as well. For quite some time after my case had taken all my rights from me, I couldn't bear to watch this film because the pain was so severe that watching it brought tears -- bitter tears -- to my eyes. When a person watches Robin Williams and cries, something is VERY wrong.Even with these caveats, there is much to enjoy in this film, and those who watch it will surely find much that they will cherish.",4,The Film Least Likely That Succeeds,1110585600,"03 12, 2005",2005,3187,"['teacher', 'script', 'writing', 'will', 'use', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'perfect', 'example', 'plot', 'nobody', 'can', 'believe', 'What', 'woman', 'today', 'America', 'would', 'hire', 'caretaker', 'children', 'places', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Freak', 'Central', 'entire', 'nation', 'placing', 'classified', 'ad', 'newspaper', 'trying', 'luck', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'respond', 'only', 'wacky', 'answers', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'role', 'alienated', 'father', 'unemployed', 'actor', 'Daniel', 'Hilliard', 'ad', 'totally', 'believable', 'certainly', 'quite', 'few', 'doubts', 'sort', 'mother', 'Miranda', 'Hilliard', 'Sally', 'Field', 'must', 'be', 'leaving', 'three', 'children', 'people', 'such', 'fashion', 'Then', 'once', 'rather', 'pachydermal', 'Euphegenia', 'Doubtfire', 'who', 'Daniel', 'Hilliard', 'drag', 'thanks', 'cosmetic', 'genius', 'gay', 'brother', 'Frank', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'doorstep', 'bothering', 'check', 'out', 'background', 'references', 'basis', 'initial', 'conversation', 'not', 'even', 'detecting', 'woman', 'man', 'lived', 'years', 'matrimony', 'Believable', 'Not', 'life', 'great', 'entertainment.Robin', 'Williams', 'usual', 'manic', 'comic', 'genius', 'Sally', 'Field', 'excellent', 'foil', 'excessive', 'manner', 'Aside', 'two', 'however', 'action', 'limited', 'none', 'three', 'children', 'Lydia', 'Lisa', 'Jakub', 'Chris', 'Matthew', 'Lawrence', 'Nattie', 'Mara', 'Wilson', 'play', 'inconsequential', 'children', 'roles', 'film', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Miranda', 'old', 'flame', 'Stu', 'Dunmeyer', 'who', 'up', 'be', 'threat', 'place', 'Daniel', 'once', 'occupied', 'life', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'offer', 'there', 'largely', 'object', 'be', 'attacked', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'appearance', 'start', 'film', 'film', 'push', 'direction', 'inevitably', 'take', 'cross-dressing', 'arena', 'theme', 'dropped', 'not', 'resumed.The', 'film', 'topic', 'non-custodial', 'parenting', 'joint', 'parenting', 'very', 'kind', 'way', 'far', 'kinder', 'reality', 'most', 'non-custodial', 'parents', 'face', 'real', 'world', 'film', 'very', 'happily', 'way', 'charming', 'endearing', 'mistaking', 'person', 'watching', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'come', 'away', 'good', 'feeling', 'everyone', 'parent', 'who', 'been', 'so', 'severely', 'burned', 'family', 'court', 'parent', 'lost', 'rights', 'one', 'caveat', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'everyone', 'hesitation', 'am', 'also', 'parent', 'who', 'faced', 'horrors', 'family', 'court', 'know', 'how', 'brutal', 'can', 'be', 'son', 'said', 'divorce', 'proceedings', 'moved', 'forward', 'Face', 'Daddy', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'Mrs', 'Doubtfire', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'time', 'children', 'stood', 'up', 'mother', 'court', 'as', 'well', 'quite', 'time', 'case', 'had', 'taken', 'rights', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'watch', 'film', 'pain', 'was', 'so', 'severe', 'watching', 'brought', 'tears', 'bitter', 'tears', 'eyes', 'When', 'person', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'cries', 'something', 'VERY', 'wrong.Even', 'caveats', 'much', 'enjoy', 'film', 'who', 'watch', 'will', 'surely', 'find', 'much', 'will', 'cherish']",Mrs Doubtfire VHS

353185,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,6303049079,Busy Body,"[6, 7]","In 1993, Chris Columbus directed Mrs. Doubtfire, one of the funniest films of the 1990's. It has since become one of my favourite films ever, and never fails to make me laugh every time I watch it. The film became a massive worldwide Box Office success at Christmas and made Robin Williams an even bigger international superstar. The film is very popular amongst the public, but critics often have a hard time giving it any praise at all, because of the acting. Even I admit that the acting in Mrs. Doubtfire is not excellent, but if you can get past that and focus on the jokes and the storyline, then you're onto a real winner.Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is happily married to his lovely wife Miranda (Sally Field). Together, they have three children. Their only son is Chris (Matthew Lawrence). With him, they have two daughters. The youngest is Natalie (Mara Wilson) and the oldest is Lydia (Lisa Jakub). Miranda is a highly successful designer, and she is the one who runs the household, pays the bills and manages to live in such a massive house. Daniel is constantly between jobs, voicing cartoon characters on kids' television shows. Because of this, he gets to spend much more time with his children than Miranda does. To Daniel, life couldn't be better, but for Miranda life is hell. She constantly works and gets to spend no time with her children. The film begins (after a short introduction) one day when it is Chris' birthday. His mum says they cannot have a party, but Daniel disobeys these rules by going ahead and throwing a street party (complete with Petting Zoo!) while Miranda's at work. She returns home after a tip off from the next door neighbour totally disgusted, later telling Daniel that she wants a divorce. He is heartbroken, as are the kids. Three months later at their divorce, Daniel loses custody of his children to Miranda. He is desperate to be with his children, and no special visitation rights are good enough. So, along with his gay brother (and his partner), they hatch a disguise for Daniel. After many hours of treatment and disguises, Mrs. Doubtfire is finally born...Daniel catches the advertisement from Miranda for a housekeeper, and rings up to inquire for the job in many awful personas that make Miranda think twice, but then Mrs. Doubtfire inquires. Fooled by Daniel's disguise, Miranda instantly hires Mrs. Doubtfire after one interview. No one knows that Mrs. Doubtfire is indeed Daniel in disguise. His children feel so far away from their father, but he's right with them at all times - well, 3:00pm until 7:00pm. In his real world, Daniel must also get a job and a place of his own and report to a social worker, Mrs. Sellner (Anne Haney). After her divorce, Miranda begins seeing her co-worker, Stu (Pierce Brosnan).Mrs. Doubtfire contains so many excellent scenes and jokes that it's impossible to fit them all in one review. The scene where Daniel is voicing a bird for a cartoon is hilarious. Chris' birthday party is wonderful, and Daniel's impressions as he applies for a job are hysterical, too. There is also a great part where Aerosmith's ""Dude Looks Like A Lady"" plays in the background as Mrs. Doubtfire goes about her daily arrangements. Playing football with the kids, getting on a bus to an old driver who fancies 'her' and learning how to cook are the highlights. Daniel has to learn how to cook, after his first experience of doing so. The scene is a 'Oh-my-God-this-is-so-funny-I-can't-breathe' type scene! His facial expressions are priceless as Mrs. Doubtfire sets fire to her fake boobs. She screams her head off racing around the kitchen trying desperately to put the fire out with spatulas and pan lids! There's also an excellent scene where Mrs. Sellner visits Daniel to see how he's coping. She catches him in his Mrs. Doubtfire disguise, so he has to constantly change clothes and his voice to keep her fooled - and as if this wasn't funny enough, the scenes where he's making Mrs. Sellner's cup of tea are downright classic. ""Oh, your tea!"" he screams in his voice to fool the woman as she approaches the kitchen to see what's the matter with him. He has no choice but to stuff his face into cake icing to disguise himself after he looses his mask! It really is hilarious stuff. The swimming pool scenes are also excellent, where Stu asks Mrs. Doubtfire to join him and the family in the pool. ""Oh! You wicked, wicked monkey!"" she exclaims. So she sits by the side of the pool watching Stu take over Daniel's family!The film ends on Miranda's birthday where all the family, Mrs. Doubtfire and Stu are invited to Bridges restaurant for a posh meal. Unfortunately, Daniel has a business meeting with a boss at a television company where he works part-time at the same restaurant. Cue many clothes-changing moments as Mrs. Doubtfire and Daniel swop seating arrangements so they can please everyone. The film then goes onto a huge revelation (obviously that Miranda discovers Mrs. Doubtfire is Daniel in disguise) and then the film finally ends on a positive note with a clear message about divorcing families and that things aren't always as bad as they seem. Overall, an excellent comedy. Highly recommended to people of all ages.",5,The Funniest Film That I Have EVER Seen!,1055894400,"06 18, 2003",2003,5214,"['1993', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'directed', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'one',

353186,AE42JLYPXUI45,6303049079,"Chad DeFeo ""(ChandlerBingFan)""","[2, 2]","Robin Williams is widely adored by his many adoring fans around the world. I have been a long-time fan of Robin's since he starred in ""Hook"", back in 1991. When he starred in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" in 1993, I became an even bigger fan of his. He has always been histerically funny, but he displays his comical talents in a full performance here.Daniel Hillard (played by Robin Williams) is an actor, who has worked several jobs, but has never been able to maintain one for a long period of time. His current profession is lending his voice talents doing the voices of kids' cartoons. After quitting that job, he sets out to pick up his three kids from school. Among his three kids are: Lydia (Lisa Jakob), Chris (played by Matthew Lawrence), & Natalie (played by Maura Wilson). When they return home, Daniel gives Chris the best birthday party ever, until Daniel's wife, Miranda Hillard (played by Sally Field), who is also the mother of Daniel's children, comes home early. Miranda is so sick of Daniel and his games, where she finds herself not loving Daniel anymore, forcing her to file for a divorce. The kids are devastated, for they adore their father, as he does them. Miranda is granted sole custody of their children, but Daniel is allowed visitation rights. This should cheer Daniel up, for he is allowed the chance to see his children, but he can only see them on Saturdays.After learning that Miranda is placing a newspaper add for a housekeeper, Daniel makes a few calls to Miranda, speaking in different women voices. He is after the job to see his kids more often. He calls one final time, using the voice of a sweet 60-year-old British nanny. He introduces himself over the phone as Mrs. Doubtfire. Miranda arranges a meeting with the supposed Mrs. Doubtfire for the following Monday night. Daniel goes off to his brother, Frank, who is, number one: gay, and number two: a fantastic make-up artist. Frank provides Daniel with just the right wig, the right outfits, the right glasses, and the right facial mask that will force Miranda to never suspect anything is up.Daniel heads over to his old house and goes along with the meeting, where he officially introduces himself as Mrs. Euphegina Doubtfire. Miranda introduces her to the kids. Natalie and Chris take a liking to Mrs. Doubtfire, but Lydia is not impressed. Miranda officially hands Mrs. Doubtfire the job and away we go. Daniel seems to be handling everything fine: working as a shipping clerk by day and then working as a British nanny in drag by night. Lydia finally warms up to Mrs. Doubtfire. The family seems to be getting along just fine, until Daniel learns of Miranda dating her old high school boyfriend, Stuart Dunmeyer (played by the conceited Pierce Brosnan). After meeting Stuart for the first time, Daniel goes about the day as Mrs. Doubtfire, where he tends to giving Lydia an oral spelling test, helping her for school. It is not, until Daniel heads into the bathroom to make a house call, where Chris comes in and finds the secret, well, sort of. Thinking Mrs. Doubtfire is both sort of man and woman, they soon discover that Mrs. Doubtfire is not Mrs. Doubtfire, but their father in drag. Chris and Lydia are more than happy to see their father their and they swear to keep it a secret for him.Miranda's birthday is just one day away and Miranda has invited Mrs. Doubtfire to join Miranda, Stu, and the kids for a dinner on the night of Miranda's birthday, where they'll be having dinner at Miranda's favorite restaurant, Bridges. Mrs. Doubtfire tries to back out, but Natalie convinces Mrs. Doubtfire to join them. Mrs. Doubtfire makes the promise of joining them. It turns out that Daniel tried to back out of it because on the same night of Miranda's birthday, he is having a meeting with T.V. executive, Mr. Jonathan Lundy (played by Robert Prosky). Mr. Lundy is interested in Daniel's ideas of a new television daytime show for kids. It turns out that Mr. Lundy has set up a meeting between him and Daniel on the same night as Miranda's birthday, and the meeting will be held at...Bridges Restaurant. Daniel decides to be there for both occasions. He sits with the family and Stu as Mrs. Doubtfire and then heads to make a call to the front desk, asking them to send a message of his late arrival for his meeting with Mr. Lundy. He sits back down with the family, as Miranda takes Natalie on a house call. He then has Lydia and Chris head over to the dessert tray, where he sits alone with Stu. He begins throwing Stu sexual innuendos, but heads off to the bathroom, where changes out of the Mrs. D. outfit and then dresses in a suit and tie, where he heads out to join Mr. Lundy. He does this for the next several occasions, until he comes back to the family as Mrs. D and orders his dinner. Overhearing that Stu requests that there be no pepper in his, Daniel, still dressed as Mrs. D. runs off to change again and sit back down with Mr. Lundy. He gets up not even five minutes later and is back in the Mrs. D. outfit. He walks into the kitchen and secretly and cold-heartedly puts red pepper in Stu's dinner. He comes back out and sits down with Mr. Lundy. But Daniel does not realize is that he is dressed up as Mrs. Doubtfire. He convinces Mr. Lundy that Mrs. Doubtfire is the perfect host for a completely different kids show that'll have the kids immediate attention. That is when Stu begins to choke on his pepper filled dinner. Daniel runs over to Stu, still dressed as Mrs. Doubtfire and gives Stu the heimlick manuever. Stu falls backward and lands ontop of Daniel, coughing up a piece of his dinner. Daniel gets up and realizes that his facial mask, has slipped off of his eyes, causing Miranda to be enraged.Back in court, Miranda is granted to maintain her full custody of their children, while Daniel is still granted his one Saturday a week of visitation rights, but the judge has ordered the visits to be supervised. Daniel tries to convince the judge of how much he adores his children, but the judge does not give in. Daniel moves on, with being the new host of a new kids show, but he hosts the show as Mrs. Doubtfire. Miranda and the kids watch everyday, until Miranda heads down to the studio after Daniel finishes up another day's episode. He notices Miranda and looks at her coldfully and hurtful. He goes to get changed as she waits for him. Miranda reveals how much she and the kids miss Mrs. Doubtfire.The next afternoon, while watching their father's show, Miranda tells the kids to stand by the front door, for she has found a new babysitter. The new babysitter is...Daniel. He and Miranda have worked out an agreement with the courts, where everyday after school, Daniel will have the kids stay with him at his appartment for a few hours, as Miranda works her long hours. She also reveals that the supervision is done. The visits between father and kids are only between father and kids. The kids run up to get their stuff as Daniel waits outside, where Miranda watches the rest of the day's episode, where Mrs. Doubtfire is reading a letter from a little girl, whose parents had just gotten a divorce. She watches the last of the episode, feeling bad for hurting Daniel the way she did and thinking that she made a mistake in filing for the divorce. As she watches the last bit, the kids run out to their father, where they hug him so passionately and drive off to his appartment.This is a movie that have enjoyed for the last eleven years of my life. This movie is all funny and, sometimes, sad and touching, and will have all of you wanting to watch it over and over again.",5,Mrs. Doubtfire (1993),1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,7599,"['Robin',

353190,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6303049079,Classic film buff,"[0, 0]","For April Fool's Day ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" seems an appropriate viewing choice.  This film concerns a divorced father Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) who due to irresponsible behavior has limited visitation rights to his three children.  This is unacceptable to him. So when Daniel finds out his ex-wife Miranda (Sally Field) is advertising for a housekeeper, he sabotages the ad, changing the phone #.  He has his brother Frank (Harvey Fierstein), a theatrical make up artist come up with literally a new face and look, and voila he's a cozy, grey haired, elderly, soft spoken English matron known as Mrs. Doubtfire.  He completely fools Miranda and the children, and is given the job.  As Mrs. Doubtfire, he is a positive influence on them all, including himself; he becomes a better more responsible individual.  However, Daniel still harbors unrealistic dreams that the family will get back together for the sake of his being with his children, despite the fact that Miranda has moved on with her life.  So, when Miranda starts seeing a handsome, wealthy former boyfriend Stu Dunmeyer (Pierce Brosnan) who gets along well with the children Daniel in his guise of Mrs. Doubtfire jealously does all he can to sabotage the relationship.When I first saw this film back when it opened in November 1993, I liked it all right, but I thought Robin Williams was way over the top at times, and needed to be reeled in.  While I still think at times there is too much showboating by Williams, after several viewings over the years, I've mellowed I guess and appreciate the film more.  Williams does a very good job delineating the two characters, and his Mrs. Doubtfire is a very believable characterization, he's assisted by excellent makeup and wardrobe of course.The movie, while definitely a comedy that has its share of slapstick and farcical moments, does in director Christopher Columbus' vision try to deal realistically with the pain of divorce in a family.  This is true particularly in the performances of the three children Lydia (Lisa Jakobs), Chris (Matthew Lawrence) and Natalie (Mara Wilson).  Young Ms. Jakobs is especially effective in bringing out the confusion and conflict in her character even more so in several deleted scenes in which she registers very strongly.  These deleted scenes, which are of one of the excellent special features offered show a film that is much darker in the hurt and anger the children feel at the conflict between their parents during the divorce.  Don't worry though, the finished film is not a downer, and the final resolution is one is which there is a certain hope as evidenced by the title of the review, that their relationship as a family will continue to be strong, and perhaps better even if they can't all live together.  And as I said, earlier, you'll get plenty of laughs.Most of the time I felt sympathy for Sally Field's Miranda Hillard, having to be the grown up and rule enforcer in the home, in contrast to Daniel's free wheeling free spirit.  Pierce Brosnan does a nice job in a basically thankless part as Stu, but he does get to execute a skillful dive off the high board and exhibit a fine if hirsute physique which would serve him well in his forthcoming role as the new James Bond. Good support is given too by Harvey Fierstein as Daniel's sympathetic brother Frank, Anne Haney as Daniel's stern court liaison, Mrs. Sellner,  Robert Prosky as Mr. Lundy, Daniel's new boss, and Sydney Walker as a bus driver that is attracted to Mrs. Doubtfire.  Regrettably that good comic actress Polly Holliday as Gloria, the Hillards garden loving neighbor, largely wound up on the cutting room floor as you again can see in the deleted scenes.",4,"""But if there's love dear, those are the ties that bind, and you'll have a family in your heart forever.""",1333238400,"04 1, 2012",2012,3692,"['April', 'Fool', 'Day', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'appropriate', 'viewing', 'choice', 'film', 'divorced', 'father', 'Daniel', 'Hillard', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'due', 'irresponsible', 'behavior', 'limited', 'visitation', 'rights', 'three', 'children', 'unacceptable', 'So', 'when', 'Daniel', 'out', 'ex-wife', 'Miranda', 'Sally', 'Field', 'advertising', 'housekeeper', 'ad', 'changing', 'phone', 'brother', 'Frank', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'theatrical', 'make', 'up', 'artist', 'come', 'up', 'literally', 'new', 'face', 'look', 'cozy', 'grey', 'haired', 'elderly', 'soft', 'spoken', 'English', 'matron', 'known', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'completely', 'Miranda', 'children', 'given', 'job', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'positive', 'influence', 'including', 'better', 'more', 'responsible', 'individual', 'However', 'Daniel', 'still', 'unrealistic', 'dreams', 'family', 'will', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'sake', 'being', 'children', 'fact', 'Miranda', 'moved', 'life', 'So', 'when', 'Miranda', 'seeing', 'handsome', 'wealthy', 'former', 'boyfriend', 'Stu', 'Dunmeyer', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'who', 'along', 'well', 'children', 'Daniel', 'guise', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'jealously', 'can', 'sabotage', 'relationship.When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'back', 'when', 'opened', 'November', '1993', 'liked', 'right', 'thought', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'was', 'way', 'top', 'times', 'needed', 'be', 'reeled', 'still', 'think', 'times', 'too', 'much', 'showboating', 'Williams', 'several', 'viewings', 'years', ""'ve"", 'mellowed', 'guess', 'appreciate', 'film', 'more', 'Williams', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'delineating', 'two', 'characters', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'very', 'believable', 'characterization', 'assisted', 'excellent', 'makeup', 'wardrobe', 'course.The', 'movie', 'definitely', 'comedy', 'share', 'slapstick', 'farcical', 'moments', 'director', 'Christopher', 'Columbus', 'vision', 'try', 'deal', 'realistically', 'pain', 'divorce', 'family', 'true', 'particularly', 'performances', 'three', 'children', 'Lydia', 'Lisa', 'Jakobs', 'Chris', 'Matthew', 'Lawrence', 'Natalie', 'Mara', 'Wilson', 'Young', 'Ms.', 'Jakobs', 'especially', 'effective', 'bringing', 'out', 'confusion', 'conflict', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'very', 'strongly', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'one', 'excellent', 'special', 'features', 'offered', 'show', 'film', 'much', 'darker', 'hurt', 'anger', 'children', 'feel', 'conflict', 'parents', 'divorce', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'though', 'finished', 'film', 'not', 'downer', 'final', 'resolution', 'one', 'certain', 'hope', 'evidenced', 'title', 'review', 'relationship', 'family', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'strong', 'perhaps', 'better', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'live', 'together', 'said', 'earlier', ""'ll"", 'get', 'plenty', 'laughs.Most', 'time', 'felt', 'sympathy', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Miranda', 'Hillard', 'having', 'be', 'grown', 'up', 'rule', 'enforcer', 'home', 'contrast', 'Daniel', 'free', 'wheeling', 'free', 'spirit', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'nice', 'job', 'basically', 'thankless', 'part', 'Stu', 'get', 'execute', 'skillful', 'dive', 'high', 'board', 'exhibit', 'fine', 'hirsute', 'physique', 'would', 'serve', 'well', 'forthcoming', 'role', 'new', 'James', 'Bond', 'Good', 'support', 'given', 'too', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'Daniel', 'sympathetic', 'brother', 'Frank', 'Anne', 'Haney', 'Daniel', 'stern', 'court', 'liaison', 'Mrs.', 'Sellner', 'Robert', 'Prosky', 'Mr.', 'Lundy', 'Daniel', 'new', 'boss', 'Sydney', 'Walker', 'bus', 'driver', 'attracted', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'Regrettably', 'good', 'comic', 'actress', 'Polly', 'Holliday', 'Gloria', 'Hillards', 'garden', 'loving', 'neighbor', 'largely', 'wound', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'again', 'can', 'see', 'deleted', 'scenes']",Mrs Doubtfire VHS

His transforming to Mrs. Doubtfire undoubtly brings to mind Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie. Still this is an original movie since Robin Williams does not do it to launch his carrer as an actor, or to win the heart of a woman but he does it to be close to his children.The movie is hillarious with timeless funny scenes. Pierce Brosnan seems to feel awkward with the things Robin Williams does and you wonder whether he is just acting or he is REALLY feeling this way since Robin Williams does not seem to follow the script but he does his own things.On the same note the kids (especially the youngest one) give you the impression that they are genuinely amused with the things Robin Williams does.THe movie is filmed in San Fransisco, which along with New York is my favourite city for shooting films. A very entairtening movie with very positive messages about parenthood or even more specific fatherhood.

In an attempt to see more of his children he disguises himself as Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire, an elderly woman who is hired to take care of the children while their mother is at work.

353201,A1FDW1SPYKB354,6303049079,David Von Pein,"[15, 15]","A first-rate cast and an innovative script helped make 1993's &#34;Mrs. Doubtfire&#34; a big movie hit. Robin Williams, Sally Field, and Pierce Brosnan display their individual and collective acting talents in &#34;Doubtfire&#34;. I enjoyed each of their performances here. Brosnan's quiet, understated, and laid-back portrayal of &#34;the other man&#34; in Sally's life might often get overlooked in this film, but I think Brosnan's character plays very nicely against that of Mrs. Doubtfire.But this film, of course, 'belongs' to Robin Williams. It's a veritable tour-de-force for Robin here, as he manages to juggle two different roles, seemingly with ease. A remarkable &#34;two-for-the-price-of-one&#34; performance. He literally &#34;becomes&#34; Mrs. Doubtfire when he dons that wardrobe and make-up.And Sally Field, as always, is outstanding here. In a way, she has the rather thankless job of playing opposite the human twin-tornado (Robin) in this film. But Sally is able to shine through in her own right, in my view. She's always a treat to watch on the screen. And &#34;Doubtfire&#34; is no exception.Sally went from co-starring in one blockbuster movie to yet another -- after wrapping up &#34;Doubtfire&#34;, she next played Tom Hanks' mom in 1994's mega-hit (and &#34;Best Picture&#34; Oscar-winner), &#34;Forrest Gump&#34;.The &#34;Mrs. Doubtfire&#34; DVD brims over with special stuff. There are more than 30 minutes of &#34;Deleted Scenes&#34; on the disc, scenes that Director Chris Columbus was pretty much forced to cut out of the movie due to time constraints. Kind of a shame too, because nearly all of these deleted scenes are very good, and would not have been a detriment to the film at all, IMO.&#34;Doubtfire&#34; co-star Polly Holliday, no doubt, is one person who wishes a few of these tossed-out scenes had made it into the final cut of the movie. Because nearly all of Polly's work was left on the cutting room floor it seems. But, at least, these clips ARE available in some fashion -- as an extra bonus on this DVD.I've found myself watching the &#34;Deleted Scenes&#34; area of this disc as much as the film itself. Polly Holliday is an absolute riot in many of these scenes, as she interacts with &#34;Mrs. Doubtfire&#34;. Polly soon finds out that Mrs. Doubtfire's &#34;secret&#34; concoction for keeping her garden looking like a showplace is not exactly the best thing for her plants.  LOL!The DVD also contains interviews with the cast, Makeup Tests, Storyboards, Trailers, TV Ads, and more.Video looks quite good here, even though this 1999-produced DVD has not been enhanced for widescreen televisions. But the 2.35:1 non-anamorphic Widescreen picture still looks fairly sharp and clear, with good colors.There's a Dolby Digital 5.0 Surround soundtrack on the disc; along with a 2.0 DD Surround track.

And when he's off, or spinning out of control, it's literally unwatchable, but that's a topic for another day.  Fortunately he brings his A Game to MRS. DOUBTFIRE, a timeless comic caper featuring Williams in drag as an elderly British nanny.  It's like putting a fish in fresh water; Williams thrives in this environment, offering countless hilarious lines and gimmicks.  Case in point, while cooking in his garb he accidentally sets his fake bosoms on fire, forcing him to put them out with two pan lids while lamenting, ""My first day as a woman, and I'm already getting hot flashes!""Funny stuff.As a bonus, MRS. DOUBTFIRE is more than a vehicle for Williams' antics; it's also a very poignant and tender story, as the comic plays an estranged father willing to stop at nothing to spend more time with his beloved children.  Naturally dressing in drag and pretending to be a woman goes beyond the pale, so when the ruse is discovered Williams' character has a severe price to pay, and his pain is heartfelt.  Yet everything resolves with a feel-good ending and a chance for redemption.  The rest of the cast is topnotch, including Sally Field as the frustrated ex and Pierce Brosnan as Field's suitor (and subsequently Williams' antagonist).  Granted, it's impossible for Williams not to be over the top on occasion, and he does so here, but it's all in good fun.

It is also mind boggling how he got an Oscar for his minor foul-mouthed cameo in Good Will Hunting. However, every once in a long while he incredibly rises far above his journeyman talents and rightfully dons the mantle of a true master of the art.(Not that co-star Sally Field was just using up air here, either - she was a great anchor of reality for the film. Which is not an easy task to perform for someone as cute and bubbly as she normally is.)Robin's actually done five other proper acting jobs, which round out an even half dozen when added to Doubtfire. And these few other fine movies are, not surprisingly, parts where he really doesn't play himself: Good Morning Vietnam, Hook, Jumangi, Dead Poets Society and Cadillac Man.Well, most actors when their careers are over should consider themselves lucky to even end up with a trilogy of film classics in the can, after doing the usual 25 to 50 major works. But right now Robin's got those six gems, and he still has time to complete a crown of an even dozen.Of course he'd already have had time to do that by now, if only he had just said no when his agent called to ask him if he wanted to do flop-bound flicks like Shlubber, Jerk or Bicentennial Bum.",5,"Not A Big Robin Williams Fan, But...",1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,1836,"['fine', 'see', 'Mork', 'Ork', 'fans', 'gushing', 'how', 'perfect', 'everything', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'even', 'touched', 'ever', 'will', 'touch', 'reality', 'however', 'just', 'decent', 'TV', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'also', 'do', 'cartoon', 'voice', 'dubs.That', 'why', 'feel', 'when', 'someone', 'movie', 'should', 'mean', 'lot', 'more', 'Watching', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'was', 'forced', 'admire', 'sheer', 'guts', 'tackling', 'Tootsie', 'role', 'sans', 'roll', 'huge', 'success', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'already', 'had', 'it.Most', 'Robin', 'film', 'parts', 'amount', 'large', 'junkpile', 'bad', 'remakes', 'half-written', 'plots', 'other', 'quot', 'least', 'fat', 'paycheck', 'quot', 'duds', 'also', 'mind', 'boggling', 'how', 'got', 'Oscar', 'minor', 'foul-mouthed', 'cameo', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'However', 'once', 'long', 'incredibly', 'far', 'journeyman', 'talents', 'rightfully', 'mantle', 'true', 'master', 'art', 'Not', 'co-star', 'Sally', 'Field', 'was', 'just', 'using', 'up', 'air', 'here', 'was', 'great', 'anchor', 'reality', 'film', 'Which', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'perform', 'someone', 'cute', 'bubbly', 'normally', 'Robin', 'actually', 'done', 'five', 'other', 'proper', 'acting', 'jobs', 'round', 'out', 'even', 'half', 'dozen', 'when', 'added', 'Doubtfire', 'few', 'other', 'fine', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'parts', 'where', 'really', ""n't"", 'play', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'Hook', 'Jumangi', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'Cadillac', 'Man.Well', 'most', 'actors', 'when', 'careers', 'are', 'over', 'should', 'consider', 'lucky', 'even', 'end', 'up', 'trilogy', 'film', 'classics', 'can', 'doing', 'usual', '25', '50', 'major', 'works', 'right', 'now', 'Robin', 'got', 'six', 'gems', 'still', 'time', 'complete', 'crown', 'even', 'dozen.Of', 'course', ""'d"", 'already', 'have', 'had', 'time', 'do', 'now', 'only', 'had', 'just', 'said', 'when', 'agent', 'called', 'ask', 'wanted', 'do', 'flop-bound', 'flicks', 'Shlubber', 'Jerk', 'Bicentennial', 'Bum']",Mrs Doubtfire VHS

It is just hysterical, and an excellent film. Robin Williams portrays Daniel Hillard, a laid-back father who is absolutely crazy about his three children, who love him just as much. When Daniel's behavior becomes more than his wife Miranda (Sally Field) can handle, she files a divorce. Daniel is devastated at the loss of his wife, but more than that, he cannot stand to be separated from his children. He is willing to make as many sacrifices as he needs in order to be with them, even if it means putting on a dress, a bodysuit and a little makeup and portraying a devoted old nanny whom Miranda instantly hires to help take care of the kids. In the process, Daniel works hard to shape up his own life and ultimately mature as a parent. You will laugh hysterically at Daniel's attempts as &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire,&quot; and you will be touched at the special pains he goes to just to see his children every day. Of course, it's not just Robin Williams who supplies the entertainment in this movie. Mara Wilson, who plays Daniel's youngest daughter Nattie, will have you rolling on the floor laughing. With that sweet little lisp and the innocence of a 5-year-old, she almost stole the show (in my opinion). There is a very good cast here, and this movie has everything.

There is no doubt that it is a good comedy, but it simply is not a film that you can watch repeatedly, as it definitely loses its impact if you watch it too often. I really got fed up with this film sometime around 1995 as I had seen it too often (cinema, television, video). I have not watched the film since, until I sat down and watched this DVD for the review. Returning to it after a break of six years certainly has freshened up the comedy a little and it has turned out to be something of a pleasant experience to do this review. I guess now that I should resist the temptation to watch the DVD again until maybe 2006.Funnily enough I was reminded of this problem with the film by my brother when it was announced that I had the DVD for review: ""Not a film you can watch too often"" he said, and reminded me of the fact that I had not seen it for a while.That is not to say that it is a bad film, but simply that it is a film that outstays its welcome very quickly in my view. The story is a pretty simple one. Manic but loving father of three and sometime actor Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) has a knack for annoying his busy professional wife Miranda (Sally Field). This is no more evidenced than when he collects his children from school on his son's twelfth birthday and takes them home for a birthday party - a party specifically forbidden by dear old mother - complete with a mobile zoo. Cue one nosey neighbour who drops poor old Daniel in it by telephoning Miranda. Cue the obligatory mid-life marital bust-up and the dreaded D-word. Daniel finds himself in court with a judge passing sentence on him - 90 days to prove he is worthy of joint custody of his children or else: in the interim, Saturday-only visits. Faced with limited options, he gets himself an apartment, gets a job and sets out to impress his case worker. Then, he finds out that Miranda is planning to employ a housekeeper to look after the children and house during the afternoon and evening until Miranda returns from work.Desperate for more time with his children, Daniel makes the natural choice of gaining the job, which he does by slightly devious means. Thus is born Mrs Doubtfire, the almost perfect housekeeper who miraculously gets everything working almost to perfection, although watching wealthy Stu Dunmire (Pierce Brosnan) muscling in on his ex-wife and children sometimes gets a little too much. The merriment continues as ""she"" gets the opportunity of a new career at the television station where he works.Just as Tootsie depended entirely on Dustin Hoffman carrying off the role of the cross-dresser, so Mrs Doubtfire depends pretty much entirely upon Robin Williams carrying off the role of the cross-dresser. Since Robin Williams is an extremely talented actor, even if perhaps not so talented chooser of roles, there was little doubt that he had the ability to carry off the role. However, the film was to a large extent made by the performance of Sally Field playing off Robin Williams, and some of their scenes together are about as good as you can see in comedy. Pretty much the rest of the cast were along for the ride, and it would appear to have been a rather enjoyable ride, with only Harvey Fierstein being completely memorable. The direction of Chris Columbus is pretty taut and this generally is a very decent effort across the board.Certainly a film to be enjoyed, just not every other day in my view. There might be better around but this is still worthy of consideration.",3,An enjoyable film for the whole family,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,3676,"['Somewhere', 'mid', '1990s', 'Mrs', 'Doubtfire', 'moved', 'being', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'being', 'decent', 'enough', 'way', 'wile', 'away', 'couple', 'hours', 'Therein', 'big', 'problem', 'film', 'doubt', 'good', 'comedy', 'simply', 'not', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'definitely', 'impact', 'watch', 'too', 'often', 'really', 'got', 'fed', 'up', 'film', 'sometime', 'around', '1995', 'had', 'seen', 'too', 'often', 'cinema', 'television', 'video', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'film', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'DVD', 'review', 'Returning', 'break', 'six', 'years', 'certainly', 'freshened', 'up', 'comedy', 'little', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'do', 'review', 'guess', 'now', 'should', 'resist', 'temptation', 'watch', 'DVD', 'again', 'maybe', '2006.Funnily', 'enough', 'was', 'reminded', 'problem', 'film', 'brother', 'when', 'was', 'announced', 'had', 'DVD', 'review', 'Not', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'too', 'often', 'said', 'reminded', 'fact', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'while.That', 'not', 'say', 'bad', 'film', 'simply', 'film', 'welcome', 'very', 'quickly', 'view', 'story', 'pretty', 'simple', 'one', 'Manic', 'loving', 'father', 'three', 'sometime', 'actor', 'Daniel', 'Hillard', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'knack', 'annoying', 'busy', 'professional', 'wife', 'Miranda', 'Sally', 'Field', 'more', 'evidenced', 'when', 'children', 'school', 'son', 'twelfth', 'birthday', 'home', 'birthday', 'party', 'party', 'specifically', 'forbidden', 'dear', 'old', 'mother', 'complete', 'mobile', 'zoo', 'Cue', 'one', 'nosey', 'neighbour', 'who', 'poor', 'old', 'Daniel', 'telephoning', 'Miranda', 'Cue', 'obligatory', 'mid-life', 'marital', 'bust-up', 'dreaded', 'D-word', 'Daniel', 'court', 'judge', 'passing', 'sentence', '90', 'days', 'prove', 'worthy', 'joint', 'custody', 'children', 'else', 'interim', 'Saturday-only', 'visits', 'Faced', 'limited', 'options', 'apartment', 'job', 'out', 'impress', 'case', 'worker', 'Then', 'out', 'Miranda', 'planning', 'employ', 'housekeeper', 'look', 'children', 'house', 'afternoon', 'evening', 'Miranda', 'returns', 'work.Desperate', 'more', 'time', 'children', 'Daniel', 'natural', 'choice', 'gaining', 'job', 'slightly', 'devious', 'means', 'Thus', 'born', 'Mrs', 'Doubtfire', 'almost', 'perfect', 'housekeeper', 'who', 'miraculously', 'everything', 'working', 'almost', 'perfection', 'watching', 'wealthy', 'Stu', 'Dunmire', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'muscling', 'ex-wife', 'children', 'sometimes', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'merriment', 'opportunity', 'new', 'career', 'television', 'station', 'where', 'Tootsie', 'depended', 'entirely', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'carrying', 'off', 'role', 'cross-dresser', 'Mrs', 'Doubtfire', 'pretty', 'much', 'entirely', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'carrying', 'off', 'role', 'cross-dresser', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'extremely', 'talented', 'actor', 'even', 'perhaps', 'not', 'so', 'talented', 'chooser', 'roles', 'was', 'little', 'doubt', 'had', 'ability', 'carry', 'off', 'role', 'However', 'film', 'was', 'large', 'extent', 'made', 'performance', 'Sally', 'Field', 'playing', 'off', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'see', 'comedy', 'Pretty', 'much', 'rest', 'cast', 'were', 'along', 'ride', 'would', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'ride', 'only', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'being', 'completely', 'memorable', 'direction', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'pretty', 'taut', 'generally', 'very', 'decent', 'effort', 'board.Certainly', 'film', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'just', 'not', 'other', 'day', 'view', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'around', 'still', 'worthy', 'consideration']",Mrs Doubtfire VHS

There could have been no better choice for the  title role than Williams due to his extremely expressionistic face, his  wonderful vocal range and his adeptness with both humour and melancholy.  The story is simple - irresponsible husband dresses up as a housekeeper to  win his family back. The skill of the film is how this implausible plot is  handled. Williams makes &quot;Daniel Hillard&quot; the type you could  believe would go to such extremes! Much of the movies fun comes from the  way Daniel/Mrs Doubtfire handles his wifes new love interest - Stu (Pierce  Brosnan) with sly asides. Eg: When Stu steps out of a swimming pool she  says &quot;From the look of you that water is so cold.&quot; The highlight  is the restuarant sequence where Daniel has appointments as both himself  and his femme half and must continually change identities. The best lines  (and there are many throughout the film) come when Mrs Doubtfire comments  on Stu's gift to Miranda. &quot;Bit of a down payment eh?&quot; Like  Tootsie, this film is a gem with pathos, humour and old-fashioned charm.",4,Irresistable entertainment.,954720000,"04 3, 2000",2000,1464,"['doubt', 'modern', 'comedy', 'films', 'men', 'drag', 'such', 'quot', 'Priscilla', 'Queen', 'Desert', 'quot', 'quot', 'Tootsie', 'quot', 'quot', 'Mrs', 'Doubtfire', 'quot', 'have', 'worked', 'beautifully', 'due', 'carefully', 'conceived', 'bittersweet', 'scripts', 'impeccable', 'casting', 'quot', 'Mrs', 'Doubtfire', 'quot', ""n't"", 'quite', 'astute', 'comedy', 'quot', 'Tootsie', 'quot', 'good', 'fun', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'title', 'role', 'Williams', 'due', 'extremely', 'expressionistic', 'face', 'wonderful', 'vocal', 'range', 'adeptness', 'humour', 'melancholy', 'story', 'simple', 'irresponsible', 'husband', 'up', 'housekeeper', 'win', 'family', 'back', 'skill', 'film', 'how', 'implausible', 'plot', 'handled', 'Williams', 'quot', 'Daniel', 'Hillard', 'quot', 'type', 'could', 'believe', 'would', 'go', 'such', 'extremes', 'Much', 'movies', 'fun', 'way', 'Daniel/Mrs', 'Doubtfire', 'wifes', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'Stu', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'sly', 'asides', 'Eg', 'When', 'Stu', 'swimming', 'pool', 'quot', 'look', 'water', 'so', 'cold.', 'quot', 'highlight', 'restuarant', 'sequence', 'where', 'Daniel', 'appointments', 'femme', 'half', 'must', 'continually', 'change', 'identities', 'best', 'lines', 'are', 'many', 'film', 'come', 'when', 'Mrs', 'Doubtfire', 'comments', 'Stu', 'gift', 'Miranda', 'quot', 'Bit', 'down', 'payment', 'eh', 'quot', 'Tootsie', 'film', 'gem', 'pathos', 'humour', 'old-fashioned', 'charm']",Mrs Doubtfire VHS

I recently managed to get it on DVD, and was actually shocked when I turned it over, and discovered it had extras! Wow! And half-decent ones too. This is also one of my favourite Robin Williams movies ever, he's excellent, and shows his wide range of voices during this. And the fact he's also half gorilla. Has no one ever told him to wax?! He got rid of his arm hair for One Hour Photo, but I dread to think where else he's got hair ... :)It's got such an original storyline to it, but now it's been announced there's going to be a sequel, nearly 14 years after the original! And Bonnie Hunt has written it? It was actually announced on IMDB on 1st April this year, so we'll see :) I honestly cannot see any of the kids coming back, never mind Sally Field, but Robin Williams is pencilled in for it. All the kids have long since grown up and most of them haven't done that much, particularly the actress who played Lydia, and that precocious little brat, Mara Wilson. (Who looks exactly the same.) The son, Matthew Lawrence, has done a few things, but nothing to write home about, but has turned out quite cute.Mrs Doubtfire is absolutely hilarious, and still makes me laugh years on from watching it on video - which I still actually own. Ugh. It's all the makeup tryouts and everything. And also, I never realised as a young kid that Uncle Frank & the other guy were a couple. How innocent. You'll laugh at the bit where Daniel drops his 'face' - which took 50 takes - and everything else about this film.Robin Williams is well-known for his improvisation during scenes in this movie but it also got him into trouble! But it was all Christopher Columbus' fault for giving him a chance to do what he wanted to do. His improvisation can occasionally spark off numerous references to other works that prove to be legal headaches for movie studios. The scene where Daniel speaks with his wife and refers to her clothes as ""this lovely Dances With Wolves motif"", required legal clearance for the studio to put it in the film. Associate producer Paula DuPr&eacute; Pesman later kept track of every reference Williams made while improvising. During the scene when Mrs. Sellner comes to inspect Daniel's apartment and Daniel/Mrs. Doubtfire is serving her tea, the icing on his/her face is melting off. This was not intentional. The heat from the set lights melted the icing on his face and Robin Williams improvised the bulk of that scene.Much of the extras are your typical deleted scenes, and interviews, but with Robin starring, they're actually funny, and a joy to watch. The makeup tests were filmed, and end on a brilliant note, with Robin telling the cameraman that they ""shot the s**t out of that one"". And also the deleted scenes included some scenes which I reckon should have been kept in the movie. Some were hilarious! And there's 30 minutes of them too, but some are obviously very long - but the subplot with the next door neighbour has to be seen to be believed, and is hilarious.This movie is a must-have for any fan of Robin's and is well-worth seeing, if, shock horror, you haven't seen it before.

Based upon the novel &quot;Alias Madame Doubtfire&quot; written by Anne Fine, Robin Williams plays the role of Daniel Hillard, a frequently unemployed actor who specializes in voice impersonations.  He and his wife Miranda (Sally Field) have three children: Lydia (Lisa Jakub), Chris (Matthew Lawrence) and Natalie (Mara Wilson).  With Miranda working as a highly successful designer, Daniel spends more time with the children than she can. After Miranda comes home to find her home in total disarray with an uproarious birthday party for Chris that includes petting-zoo animals, she completely loses her temper and tells Daniel that she wants a divorce.  Daniel is dumbstruck and eventually loses custody of the children to Miranda in court, but wants desperately to spend more time with them than his visitation privileges allow.  Upon learning that Miranda plans to hire a nanny to stay with the children when she's at work, Daniel decides to present himself as a potential nanny to Miranda.  With the aid of his brother Frank (Harvey Fierstein), who is a makeup artist, and his brother's partner Jack (Scott Capurro), Daniel is transformed into a kindly old woman that he names Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire.  Fooled by Daniel's disguise, Miranda hires Mrs. Doubtfire.  The story heats up even more when Miranda is courted by an old friend, Stuart 'Stu' Dunmeyer (Pierce Brosnan).The acting in the film, especially Sally Field and Robin Williams, is superb and the story is completely engaging.  Memorable scenes in the film include Chris' birthday party, Daniel's first interview with the social worker Mrs. Sellner (Anne Haney), Daniel getting a regular job, Daniel's various impersonations over the telephone, Frank &amp; Jack testing various disguises on Daniel, Mrs. Doubtfire cooking her first dinner, Mrs. Sellner's visit to Daniel's apartment, the country club, and the restaurant.  Other very memorable characters in the film include Jonathan Lundy (Robert Prosky), the bus driver (Sydney Walker), Mr. Sprinkles (William Newman), and Daniel's boss at the TV station (Joe Bellan).If you enjoy films such as &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982) and &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (1959), you're sure to enjoy &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;.  Overall, I rate &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a funny and engaging comedy.",5,You mean like Shelley Winters older or Shirley MacLaine old?,1054252800,"05 30, 2003",2003,2508,"['1993', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'directed', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'ever', 'starred', 'quot', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'quot', 'Based', 'novel', 'quot', 'Alias', 'Madame', 'Doubtfire', 'quot', 'written', 'Anne', 'Fine', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'role', 'Daniel', 'Hillard', 'frequently', 'unemployed', 'actor', 'who', 'voice', 'impersonations', 'wife', 'Miranda', 'Sally', 'Field', 'have', 'three', 'children', 'Lydia', 'Lisa', 'Jakub', 'Chris', 'Matthew', 'Lawrence', 'Natalie', 'Mara', 'Wilson', 'Miranda', 'working', 'highly', 'successful', 'designer', 'Daniel', 'more', 'time', 'children', 'can', 'Miranda', 'home', 'find', 'home', 'total', 'disarray', 'uproarious', 'birthday', 'party', 'Chris', 'petting-zoo', 'animals', 'completely', 'temper', 'tells', 'Daniel', 'divorce', 'Daniel', 'dumbstruck', 'eventually', 'custody', 'children', 'Miranda', 'court', 'desperately', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'visitation', 'privileges', 'allow', 'learning', 'Miranda', 'hire', 'nanny', 'stay', 'children', 'when', 'work', 'Daniel', 'present', 'potential', 'nanny', 'Miranda', 'aid', 'brother', 'Frank', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'who', 'makeup', 'artist', 'brother', 'partner', 'Jack', 'Scott', 'Capurro', 'Daniel', 'transformed', 'kindly', 'old', 'woman', 'Mrs.', 'Euphegenia', 'Doubtfire', 'Fooled', 'Daniel', 'disguise', 'Miranda', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'story', 'up', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'Miranda', 'courted', 'old', 'friend', 'Stuart', ""'Stu"", 'Dunmeyer', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', '.The', 'acting', 'film', 'especially', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'superb', 'story', 'completely', 'engaging', 'Memorable', 'scenes', 'film', 'include', 'Chris', 'birthday', 'party', 'Daniel', 'first', 'interview', 'social', 'worker', 'Mrs.', 'Sellner', 'Anne', 'Haney', 'Daniel', 'getting', 'regular', 'job', 'Daniel', 'various', 'impersonations', 'telephone', 'Frank', 'amp', 'Jack', 'testing', 'various', 'disguises', 'Daniel', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'cooking', 'first', 'dinner', 'Mrs.', 'Sellner', 'visit', 'Daniel', 'apartment', 'country', 'club', 'restaurant', 'Other', 'very', 'memorable', 'characters', 'film', 'include', 'Jonathan', 'Lundy', 'Robert', 'Prosky', 'bus', 'driver', 'Sydney', 'Walker', 'Mr', 'Sprinkles', 'William', 'Newman', 'Daniel', 'boss', 'TV', 'station', 'Joe', 'Bellan', '.If', 'enjoy', 'films', 'such', 'quot', 'Tootsie', 'quot', '1982', 'quot', 'Hot', 'quot', '1959', ""'re"", 'sure', 'enjoy', 'quot', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'quot', 'Overall', 'rate', 'quot', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'quot', '5', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoy', 'funny', 'engaging', 'comedy']",Mrs Doubtfire VHS

They didn't remember seeing it when they were younger and now that they are adults, it has a slightly different meaning to them anyway.The basic story is a mother and father are getting a divorce, and the father is given limited visitation and time with his kids, but he misses them and wants to spend more time with them, to see them grow up and to know what they are doing. Plus, part of him probably wants to keep tabs on mom and the family too, from the inside. So, since this father is an actor of sorts--though not really a successful one--he dresses up in stage makeup and costume and becomes a housekeeper/babysitter and applies for the job his wife has posted to help take care of the kids. And he gets the job too.Then some hilarious stuff ensues as he tries to hide his true identity from the kids and the wife, while also becoming important to the kids and a near best-friend to the wife. That is, until they discover who he really is.It has a happy ending, but I won't spoil the ending here.There are some funny moments. It's not what I would consider Robin Williams's finest moments, but there are some chuckle-worthy moments.

While there's no argument that there are some sublimely funny moments in this movie, they weave their way through a plot who's message is:  divorce is okay, kids are resilient, and if Mom and Dad are happy, the kids will be, too.Sally Fields plays a woman who chooses to divorce her husband (Robin Williams) because (1) hubby is immature and (2) wife is tired of always having to play the heavy.  Sounds like good grounds for destroying a family, huh?Dad moves out of the house, is denied any custody of the children, instead with access to the children limited to a few hours of weekly visitation.  That becomes the catalyst for him to mature, hold down a steady job, and become a responsible parent.  Oh well, too late, his wife decided that she's happier having shed him from her life, and if the kids are a bit sullen and griefstruck, that's tough luck for them too, because Mom's got a new love interest and has moved on from Dad.  Dad also seems to be enjoying his new single status, lusting after women (to great comic effect while in drag), with his primary interest at reconcilliation rooted in getting back to his kids more than his wife.The most repulsive moment comes at the end, when Williams has landed a new job hosting a kids' TV show, and he works in a little story for the kids about how it's okay if Mom and Dad don't live together...that doesn't mean they don't love you.

353289,AN1ZRE67BMH4,6303049079,"Peter Tarique ""Scype""","[2, 2]","This movie takes a hopeless premise,and mixes in two actors - Robin Williams and Sally Fields - who are so dissimilar in their talents that their pairing should be D.O.A., and pulls out a surprisingly funny and effective movie. I am stunned at the quality.  Understand that Robin Williams has very limited range to his acting. See the opening scenes of Mrs. Doubtfire where he quits his job -dubbing voices into cartoons - over a trivial moral issue. Is the scene convincing? Does he appear to have the right level of passion to truly walk out on his job? No. As an actor, he is merely Robin Williams in his films. But his manic side really distinguishes him from any other actor alive.  Sally Field, however, is a great actress (and greatly unappreciated, too.) She has the range to do almost anything - but cracking jokes is not her forte, and manic is not within her range at all.  So what happens? Robin is enormously funny when he is getting his makeup applied by Harvey Fierstein, gigging the court-appointed monitor, and tormenting Pierce Brosnan. But in the Robin-only scenes, the film stands still -as if he is doing a stand-up routine.  But when Sally is on-camera, the story moves.... and there is emotional power in the scenes. She is dead-on convincing in almost every scene, in almost every emotional state. She tells no jokes and creates a realness and a context that brings the best out of Robin's emoting. There would be no movie without Robin, but it is Sally that makes the movie something much more than Three Men and A Baby.  Even Pierce Brosnan works - in an unusual twist he plays a male version of the type of role that many gorgeous actresses are accustomed to play - his role is simply to be good-looking and charming so that other characters can be jealous or lust-filled. And yet, even he shows 3-dimensionality to his character, with the help of some sensitive script-writing.  So its a triumph - a genuinely interesting and fun film.

But as a comedy, this is still a very good film and it does allow Williams to go a bit more over-the-top than some of his other projects have.  A prime example is his multiple phone calls as various different characters considered unsuitable by the poor soul at the other end of the line.  As for the rest of the cast, they were definitely the collective straight-man to Williams's continuous unpredictability.  Well, that applies to almost everyone...one couple is exempt.  Ultimately, my biggest problem in the film is that, while Robin Williams and his on-screen wife, Sally Field, are obviously unhappy (the divorce is a clue there), we never get a glimpse into what they're losing.  Weren't these two happy with each other at one point?  They had to be, right?  They got three kids out of it, didn't they?

What might have been a one-joke idea about a flaky, unemployed Dad who has a radical makeover in order to be near his kids, Williams makes it an engaging & fun journey, with a sincere & heartful message about why parents sometimes must divorce. The young actors who play Williams' kids are adorable without being precocious, the sturdy ""out"" actor Harvey Fierstein is terrific as his doting make-up artist brother, and the wonderful Sally Field is tops as his estranged wife, a strong actress who can hold her own quite well against Williams' manic genius.It takes a good comic actor to make a fictional character like Mrs. Doubtfire seem amusing, sympathetic and, above all, tangible. Even in the heart-rending scenes in which Williams expresses his need to be near his children, you feel for him.Another triumph for both Williams & director Chris Columbus...and a must-have comedy!",5,"Williams proves being a nanny is a real ""drag""",1256774400,"10 29, 2009",2009,986,"['opinion', 'one', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'best', 'films', 'mean', 'when', 'say', 'film', 'way', 'What', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'one-joke', 'idea', 'flaky', 'unemployed', 'Dad', 'who', 'radical', 'makeover', 'order', 'be', 'kids', 'Williams', 'engaging', 'fun', 'journey', 'sincere', 'heartful', 'message', 'why', 'parents', 'sometimes', 'must', 'divorce', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Williams', 'kids', 'are', 'adorable', 'being', 'precocious', 'sturdy', 'actor', 'Harvey', 'Fierstein', 'terrific', 'doting', 'make-up', 'artist', 'brother', 'wonderful', 'Sally', 'Field', 'tops', 'estranged', 'wife', 'strong', 'actress', 'who', 'can', 'hold', 'own', 'quite', 'well', 'Williams', 'manic', 'genius.It', 'good', 'comic', 'actor', 'make', 'fictional', 'character', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'seem', 'amusing', 'sympathetic', 'tangible', 'Even', 'heart-rending', 'scenes', 'Williams', 'need', 'be', 'children', 'feel', 'him.Another', 'triumph', 'Williams', 'director', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'must-have', 'comedy']",Mrs Doubtfire VHS

I finally watched it when it came out in video.  Robin Williams is hilarious as the ex-husband looking for some way to spend more time with the kids.  The plot is far-reaching but, then, so is Robin Williams's humor; his presence gives us a better inclination to just sit back and enjoy rather than figure out how the heck anyone could expect us to believe this plot.Williams get a removable makeover as a somewhat elderly English nanny.  The possibilities are numerous and Williams gives us a look at plenty of them.  Having willfully given up worrying about reality, we accept the fact that no one is any the wiser to just who is this Mrs. Doubtfire.  He/she becomes the responsible father figure the children never seemed to have had before.  There are antics with the social worker and the ex's new boy friend.  All the while we're laughing hard.Unfortunately, the writer and director forgot that every movie must have a beginning, middle and ending.  Some might say that two out of three ain't bad but most of us are left wondering which organization sponsored the criptic social message that passes for a conclusion.  Some may appreciate the message that is delivered but it is in total opposition to the mood the movie had so successfully created up to that point.  This is the ending to a drama; not to a comedy and even the loudest appologists have to realize that some one decided to trash the ending to make a point.  Save it for another movie or lose it altogether.  I was seriously considering rating this movie a ""3"" because the ending was that bad.

I still remember the story, but I wanted to see the film again and I'm glad I did.The story in brief, Miranda (Sally Field) is a career woman who's tired of coming home tired from working hard and cleaning up after her actor husband, Daniel (Robin Williams) and their three children.  After a particularly disastrous birthday party for their son that got the police called for a noise complaint, she throws Daniel out and demands a divorce.This breaks Daniel and the kids' hearts, particularly when he can only see them once a week on Saturdays.  He offers to take care of the kids after school and Miranda the court decline.When Daniel learns that Miranda is going to hire a housekeeper, he decides to become that housekeeper.  With the help of his brother Frank (Harvey Fierstein), Mrs. Doubtfire is born.Daniel does such a convincing job as Mrs. D that neither the kids nor Miranda realize it's him.  The problem comes in when Stu Dunmeyer (Pierce Brosnan) enters the picture and restart a once-dead relationship with Miranda.Robin Williams literally makes this show.  I remember back when the movie was first announced, I heard he was walking around Seattle as Mrs. Doubtfire interacting with unwary (and very lucky) citizens.  In the making of secion, the cast comment that there is no Robin in Mrs. Doubtfire.

Miranda needs to hire some help to watch the kids in the afternoon.  Since Daniel is an actor, he decides to respond to Miranda's ad in the newspaper.

Probably not, but it is nice to see a positive outlook of different families, and the fact that it is all about showing love to your children and making them feel loved and secure.

We're supposed to sympathize with a character who is not only is completely irresponsible, but also destructive and manipulative, and we're supposed to see Fields' character as the bad guy?  Sorry--it just doesn't work.  This movie is simply a way for all those immature, infantile men out there who have been left by their wives to say, ""See--that's what I'm going through!"" (And I say that knowing full well that not all divorces are caused by these dynamics, but that many are, so save your angry comments about how unfair the statement is.)  The simple fact is that if Fields' character hadn't left him, the children would have been much more negatively affected by the way their father acted and her acceptance of that behavior.This all is not to mention that the comedy here is sadly unoriginal and derivative.  The scene in the restaurant is horribly contrived, for example, and not at all believable.  I'm a huge fan of the suspension of disbelief, but this movie makes you put your dunce cap on to accept some of the ""comic"" situations as actually being funny, even though virtually ALL of them can be traced to other movies in which they've been done much better.All in all, this was one of the few movies I've ever watched that has made me angry at filmmakers for presenting a situation that is incredible devastating to many people and stacking the deck in favor of the character who actually has caused the horrible situation, but who feels wronged, so the audience feels he has been wronged, too.

When Daniel Hillard gets a divorce from Miranda Hillard, Daniel only gets to see his three children once a week under the supervision of a proffesional hired by the court. Daniel decides that he won't put up with the unfair treatment and he has a plan. Miranda needs to hire a babysitter, and Daniel gets the job. He takes on an alias of Mrs. Doubtfire, a British nanny. This is the start to this family comedy.There are many lessons to be learned from this film. One message to be learned is that you should always put the good out in the sake of others to a certain extent. Daniel Hillard went to the extremes so he could spend time with his family. This film also shows how a judge, who knows nothing about the family and the life that the Hillard family had at home, makes a ruling that will change the people of the family's lives forever.

If you have watched Mrs. Doutbfire and wished to have seen more of Polly Hoilday, then I reccomend you to watch the deleted scenes because there are about 4 or 5 scenes (deleted from the movie) with Polly in them. Mrs. Doubtfire is the story of an actor named Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) who has quit in the middle of voicing characters for a cartoon starting a bird and a cat. He gets home in time to meet his 3 kids, Lydia (Lisa Jakub), Chris (Matthew Lawrence and Natalie (Mara Wilson). He throws Chris a party, but when a complaint comes to his wife Miranda Hillard (Sally Field) from a neighbor (Polly Holliday), Miranda comes home early to find her house a zoo. And catches her husband acting like a kid so she ends the birthday party and starts to clean up and gets in a fight with Daniel and decides to get a dirvoce. Daniel loses custody of the three kids and ends up ordered that he cna only see them every Saturday.Besides the deleted scenes on the dvd, you also have Commentary by Chris Columbus, On Screen interviews with Robin Willaims, Pierce Brosnan, Harvey Fierstein and Chris Columbus. Animation penical tests and more. My Thoughts on the film. This is a great movie to watch if you are either going to become a father (for the first time), going to get married and learn how to be both a good father and husband and not having your marriage ending in a dirovce. The actors and actress give a good performance. But also please remember this movie is rated PG-13 for lanuage and I'm not sure if has that rating for anything else. But if you love to watch movies on dvd with delted scenes or outakes, I also reccomend you to to watch this for that reason. So please to yourself a favor a buy this movie (if you don't own it). But if you have not seen the movie please rent it first to see if you will like this movie. And if you are a fan of ""letterbox"" format, there is a widescreen edition of this film.

In Mrs. Doubtfire Robin plays a man who dresses as an old woman to be closer to his children after his wife throws him out. His wife, played by the lovely Sally Field, needs a housekeeper and nanny while she is at work and unknowing to her she hires this old woman, the English-speaking Mrs. Doubtfire, to keep her home and family in order. The laughs are priceless and the story a tender one in that the film shows the lengths in which a man will go to in order to keep his children in his life. I can atually watch this classic a million times and never tire of it. It is really a movie for the whole family to enjoy.This fantastic two disc DVD edition features the film in widescreen as well as an informative booklet on the making of the movie. There are extended and deleted scenes included as well as the featurette ""The Evolution of Mrs. Doubtfire"" with interviews with the stars and production personnel.

353334,ARFCORBCTKX1J,6303049079,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[1, 1]","""Mrs Doubtfire"" is a watered-down version of ""Tootsie"" -- an actor has professional problems (he's ""too serious"" about his work, alienating people), and disguises himself as a woman to obtain employment. In the process of pretending to be someone he isn't, the actor develops a better understanding of himself and his relationship with other people.""Tootsie"" is rightly considered a classic (it was one of the films analyzed in my screenwriting class), primarily because it's built around the millennia-old issue of how men and women relate to each other, and we accept the preposterous situation, because it is not, per se, the story's focus, ""Mrs Doubtfire"" is about the less-universal concern of the place of the wife and husband in a marriage, and how it affects their children. The initial situation is realistic, but the events growing out of are contrived.""Mrs Doubtfire"" can't decide whether it's a drama about divorce, or a cross-dressing farce. It succeeds almost perfectly at the latter (despite too many scenes of Williams switching his costume), but largely fails at the former. Both Daniel and Miranda need to make attitude adjustments -- he recognizing that he can be an adult with his children (and they'll still love him), she acknowledging that she has largely abandoned her children for her career, and has no right to complain that he's giving the kids the attention they crave. Daniel's change is well-dramatized (eg, when Mrs D tosses the TV remote in the fishtank and insists the kids do their homework), but Miranda's is not. Sally Field's character wavers between firmness and sentimentality, without any plausible conflict. (I ascribe this to Chris Columbus's weak directing. A better director (and possibly a better script) would have found a better balance between the drama and the comedy.)Robin Williams' makeup is nothing short of startling, rightly winning the Makeup Oscar. Nevertheless, we're expected to believe that, like Clark Kent, his disguise is invisible. Williams' voice is instantly recognizable (even when doing impressions), and Mrs Doubtfire is so obviously Williams-in-drag that one wonders how his wife and children could be fooled for more than a few seconds.There are two major technical errors. The dialog for an animated film is recorded //before// the drawings are made. Cosmetic appliances (especially ones as complex as Daniel's) usually take hours to apply, and are normally thrown away after a single use.The PG-13 rating is for vulgar and sexually suggestive language that's appropriate for the story. This is not really a film for pre-teens.The Blu-ray image is grainless and creamy-smooth. If there's a loss of sharpness and detail, it isn't obvious or bothersome. There's a lot of supplemental material, including multiple takes of Williams ad-libbing.I have no problem recommending ""Mrs Doubtfire"" for a single viewing.
