Kathy combines yoga, strength training, and cardio activities into an easy to follow and effective workout.  There is even an option to do the workout with music only (minus the verbal instructions).  As usual, Kathy manages this without sappy pep talk found in other workout programs.",5,Kathy Smith does it again.,1111622400,"03 24, 2005",2005,376,"['very', 'good', 'workout', 'anyone', 'who', 'intensity', 'joint', 'strain', 'Kathy', 'combines', 'yoga', 'strength', 'training', 'cardio', 'activities', 'easy', 'follow', 'effective', 'workout', 'even', 'option', 'do', 'workout', 'music', 'only', 'verbal', 'instructions', 'usual', 'Kathy', 'sappy', 'pep', 'talk', 'found', 'other', 'workout', 'programs']",Kathy Smith - Moving Through Menopause VHS
666778,A31P4BOR51YD0C,B00005N5UE,Gizmo,"[5, 5]","Some reviews suggest that the moves aren't for beginners - I disagree.  If you could do all of the moves right away, what challenge would there be in that?  When I first tried the cardio workout, I laughed and imagined my horror if I was trying to do the routine in a gym full of people.  These moves aren't overly complicated.  Stick with it, and soon your confidence will grow as you are able to do first one move with Kathy and then another.  There are easy ways to take the level down during the routine and Kathy points them out. Today I did all but one sequence and know that I'll be doing that last one just as soon as my body finally accepts that it must do my bidding!  The cardio workout is low-impact.  My 42-year old knees complain a bit but only a bit.  Already in decent cardo shape from a year of walking and light weights, I use the 20-minute cardio workout on this DVD as a supplement to my other workouts.  The weight and yoga sections of the DVD are also excellent.  Kathy is a terrific coach - lovely and upbeat but never grating in a high-pitched cheerleader sort of way.  I highly recommend this DVD for anyone just starting back into fitness or as another tool for those days when you want some ""extra"" calorie burning and heart pumping fun.",5,You've Got to Give it Several Tries!,1114473600,"04 26, 2005",2005,1264,"['reviews', 'suggest', 'moves', 'are', ""n't"", 'beginners', 'disagree', 'could', 'do', 'moves', 'right', 'away', 'what', 'challenge', 'would', 'there', 'be', 'When', 'first', 'tried', 'cardio', 'workout', 'laughed', 'imagined', 'horror', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'routine', 'gym', 'full', 'people', 'moves', 'are', ""n't"", 'overly', 'complicated', 'Stick', 'soon', 'confidence', 'will', 'grow', 'are', 'able', 'do', 'first', 'one', 'move', 'Kathy', 'then', 'are', 'easy', 'ways', 'take', 'level', 'down', 'routine', 'Kathy', 'points', 'out', 'Today', 'did', 'one', 'sequence', 'know', ""'ll"", 'be', 'doing', 'last', 'one', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'body', 'finally', 'must', 'do', 'bidding', 'cardio', 'workout', 'low-impact', '42-year', 'old', 'knees', 'complain', 'bit', 'only', 'bit', 'Already', 'decent', 'cardo', 'shape', 'year', 'walking', 'light', 'weights', 'use', '20-minute', 'cardio', 'workout', 'DVD', 'supplement', 'other', 'workouts', 'weight', 'yoga', 'sections', 'DVD', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'Kathy', 'terrific', 'coach', 'lovely', 'upbeat', 'never', 'grating', 'high-pitched', 'cheerleader', 'sort', 'way', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'just', 'starting', 'back', 'fitness', 'tool', 'days', 'when', 'want', 'extra', 'calorie', 'burning', 'heart', 'pumping', 'fun']",Kathy Smith - Moving Through Menopause VHS

If one's in a rush & wants to do the routines, obviously, skip the talk, but one should take the time at some point to listen to the informational sections...they're informative, important, & may provide many answers to those experiencing, or those who will experience menopause. The aerobic, weight, & yoga routines are again, great for beginner to advanced. Beginners or ""time savers"" can split the apprx. 20 min. each routines. If you have the time & are in shape, go for the gold! K.S.'s routines can be tailored from beginner to advanced. The informative tidbidts regarding health tips, etc. interspliced between & within the routines are inspiring, rather than annoying, & make sense. One feels great about working out, & if you are experiencing ""peri"" or full menopause, this is an excellent tape that will make you feel better about yourself both physically & mentally.

666782,AWUN1QGNT50K7,B00005N5UE,M.C.,"[61, 65]","I purchased this DVD b/c it is a DVD.  I don't know why workouts keep coming out on VHS and rarely on DVD.  So, that said, I received this dvd today and did the 3 part workout: cardio, strength training &amp; yoga.  Each section has an overview before you begin, Kathy lets the viewer know why it's important for the body while going through menopause.  She gives the cues before the moves, the moves weren't very difficult, thus, finally a workout I could do!  The cardio workout was medium-level, I was breathing intensely but certainly not huffing &amp; puffing.  I thought the cardio was perfect.  It's only 20 minutes, so it would be great on a quick-workout day.  If you want a longer one, I suppose you could do the workout twice.  During the workout, Kathy voices over every now &amp; then with little bits of info on menopause, such as &quot;did you take your vitamin E today&quot; and explains why vitamin E is good during menopause &amp; other such tidbits.  The strength training workout lasted 20 minutes, you need weights &amp; a chair and wasn't too difficult.  One nice thing is that a picture of a person's backside was shown to let you get an even greater knowledge of doing the exercise correctly.  The yoga workout was my least favorite.  I've not done yoga before but it just seemed like stretching to me.  There is a question &amp; answer section for a doctor on menopause, and a group discussion.  Both informative.  I'm not going through menopause, I'm too young!  I just wanted to be able to buy a moderate-level cardio workout on dvd that I could do, that wasn't so choreographed &amp; jumpy that I couldn't keep up.  This is it.  Although I'd rather see Kathy's &quot;Step Workout&quot; (the best workout!) on dvd, this one is a decent substitute until something better comes out.  So bottom line, a nice overall workout on DVD and it gives lots of nutritional advice &amp; menopause information.  Just don't be put off by &quot;menopause&quot; if you're too young and not even thinking about it.  It's still a good, decent workout.",5,You don't have to be menopausal to do this workout!,1008892800,"12 21, 2001",2001,2059,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'b/c', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'workouts', 'keep', 'coming', 'out', 'VHS', 'rarely', 'DVD', 'So', 'said', 'received', 'dvd', 'today', 'did', '3', 'part', 'workout', 'cardio', 'strength', 'training', 'amp', 'section', 'overview', 'begin', 'Kathy', 'viewer', 'know', 'why', 'important', 'body', 'going', 'menopause', 'cues', 'moves', 'moves', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'difficult', 'thus', 'finally', 'workout', 'could', 'do', 'cardio', 'workout', 'was', 'medium-level', 'was', 'breathing', 'intensely', 'certainly', 'not', 'huffing', 'amp', 'puffing', 'thought', 'cardio', 'was', 'perfect', 'only', '20', 'minutes', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'quick-workout', 'day', 'want', 'longer', 'one', 'suppose', 'could', 'do', 'workout', 'twice', 'workout', 'Kathy', 'now', 'amp', 'then', 'little', 'bits', 'info', 'menopause', 'such', 'quot', 'did', 'take', 'vitamin', 'E', 'today', 'quot', 'why', 'vitamin', 'E', 'good', 'menopause', 'amp', 'other', 'such', 'tidbits', 'strength', 'training', 'workout', 'lasted', '20', 'minutes', 'need', 'weights', 'amp', 'chair', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'difficult', 'One', 'nice', 'thing', 'picture', 'person', 'backside', 'was', 'shown', 'let', 'get', 'even', 'greater', 'knowledge', 'doing', 'exercise', 'correctly', 'yoga', 'workout', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', ""'ve"", 'not', 'done', 'yoga', 'just', 'seemed', 'like', 'stretching', 'question', 'amp', 'section', 'doctor', 'menopause', 'group', 'discussion', 'informative', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'menopause', ""'m"", 'too', 'young', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'able', 'buy', 'moderate-level', 'cardio', 'workout', 'dvd', 'could', 'do', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'choreographed', 'amp', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'Kathy', 'quot', 'Step', 'Workout', 'quot', 'best', 'workout', 'dvd', 'one', 'decent', 'substitute', 'something', 'better', 'out', 'So', 'bottom', 'line', 'nice', 'overall', 'workout', 'DVD', 'lots', 'nutritional', 'advice', 'amp', 'information', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'quot', 'quot', ""'re"", 'too', 'young', 'not', 'even', 'thinking', 'still', 'good', 'decent', 'workout']",Kathy Smith - Moving Through Menopause VHS

Come wintertime and weather precluding daily walks, I finally got the video out with an apprehensive groan. Couldn't have been more wrong. Kathy makes movement fun and even inspirational. The workouts help me in ways that walking, much as I love it, cannot. So far I just do the cardio & yoga portions. The cardio makes me feel strong and energized. The yoga is so welcome - I love the stretching & the help with relaxation. Kathy's humble, folksy approach suggests she may have studied with someone like the wonderful Lilias. The only problem I have is the need to fast forward from the cardio to the yoga segments. Kathy talks about different menopausal issues and tips in between. It would have been better if the workout segments were together.
