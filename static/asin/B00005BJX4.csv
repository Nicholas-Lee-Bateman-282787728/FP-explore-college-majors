581530,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,B00005BJX4,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[0, 0]","I just saw this DVD on yesterday evening and I must say that it certainly held its own for a B-movie. While the acting was somewhat pedestrian I can't complain about the storyline, which kept me guessing right up until the end.Then there were the females! Oh my God! They were all gorgeous, save for the character that was supposed to be the kidnapped daughter. Each female character held her own to the men in this production and the writer of the screenplay never lets up. Indeed, it's the men who act like fools. Whether it's the nosy bumpkin at the beach house or Charles Taylor, a man who spent time in prison for a crime he (Supposedly) did not commit. Taylor goes from being an ex-con looking for work to an innocent dupe who clearly never learned in prison not to touch a murder weapon.I liked this movie and I'm glad I purchased it. I do recommend it to those who want a steamy mystery with lots of sex and even a little bit of action. But the sex is top notch. overall the production could have been better. Lack of lighting created a bit of grain in the footage that could have been avoided with adequate lighting. But I still rate this film Four and a Half Stars for plot and the gorgeous gals that starred in it.A.

581532,AP839YM0XJ664,B00005BJX4,Ang Poon Kah,"[161, 196]",This story is about Kira Reed's husband(whom is a ex-prisoner) working for a wealthy woman whom in the end ask him cook up a story saying her daughter is kipnapped and require a ransom. The plan was foiled because Kira Reed's husband told the wealthy woman's 'husband' bot to eat the medicine that his 'wife' and the 'lover' give him. He told him that this is a plot. Kira Reed and the police officer later 'stormed' the house of the wealthy woman's place of accomodation where she and the lover was caught setting up the plot. What I could remember about the scenes inside are these:-1)sitting sex between Kira Reed and her husband(opening shot)2)sex between the wealthy woman and Melcom.3)Sex in swimming pool between Kira Reed and her husband.4)Body touching between Kira Reed's husband and the Kate5)Body touching between Kira Reed's husband and the 'daughter' of the kate's 'husband'.2)sex between kate's 'husband' and her at bed.3)sex between Malcom and the 'daughter' of kate's 'husband'4)sex between kate and Kira Reed's husband5)sitting sex between 'daughter' of kate's 'husband' and kira Reed's husband.6)sex between Kira Reed and the police officer.so there are six erotic scenes altogther.

581535,A1J5B9VM8ZPQPP,B00005BJX4,David,"[13, 16]","Sexual Intrigue is a very average and easily forgettable softcore flick. It isn't bad, but it isn't good either. The plot revolves around a Charlie, who has just been released from serving a year in prison. His girlfriend's ex-boyfriend gets him a job working for some rich woman, who gets him involved in some stupid plan to kidnap her stepdaughter and get money from her rich husband.Throughout all this, we get eight sex scenes. All are boy/girl. Kira Reed (the girlfriend) participates in three of the scenes, Kim Dawson (the rich woman) also participates in three, and Zette Sullivan (the stepdaughter) participates in two. All the women are attractive do a good job in the sex scenes. But the sex scenes all range from poor to just decent. All are too short and a little too tame.It's a shame. In the hands of a better production team, the story and cast could have been better utilized. There were several scenes in the movie that were just long, pointless shots of someone driving down a highway or sitting on a deck and staring at the beach. That all should have been cut out and the time used to lengthen the sex scenes. Also, there are three times in the movie where it appears that two people are going to get it on with each other. But then the action just stops and we go to the next scene. Stuff like that is really annoying.Anyway, unless you are a huge fan of either Kira Reed or Kim Dawson, I don't recommend this one.",3,Run-of-the-mill softcore that could have been much better.,1145232000,"04 17, 2006",2006,1436,"['Sexual', 'Intrigue', 'very', 'average', 'easily', 'forgettable', 'softcore', 'flick', ""n't"", 'bad', ""n't"", 'good', 'either', 'plot', 'Charlie', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'released', 'serving', 'year', 'prison', 'girlfriend', 'ex-boyfriend', 'job', 'working', 'rich', 'woman', 'who', 'involved', 'stupid', 'plan', 'kidnap', 'stepdaughter', 'get', 'money', 'rich', 'husband.Throughout', 'get', 'eight', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'boy/girl', 'Kira', 'Reed', 'girlfriend', 'three', 'scenes', 'Kim', 'Dawson', 'rich', 'woman', 'also', 'three', 'Zette', 'Sullivan', 'stepdaughter', 'two', 'women', 'are', 'attractive', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'sex', 'scenes', 'sex', 'range', 'poor', 'just', 'decent', 'are', 'too', 'short', 'little', 'too', 'shame', 'hands', 'better', 'production', 'team', 'story', 'cast', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'utilized', 'were', 'several', 'scenes', 'movie', 'were', 'just', 'long', 'pointless', 'shots', 'someone', 'driving', 'down', 'highway', 'sitting', 'deck', 'staring', 'beach', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'out', 'time', 'used', 'lengthen', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Also', 'are', 'three', 'times', 'movie', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'other', 'then', 'action', 'just', 'stops', 'go', 'next', 'scene', 'Stuff', 'really', 'annoying.Anyway', 'are', 'huge', 'fan', 'Kira', 'Reed', 'Kim', 'Dawson', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'one']",Sexual Intrigue
