And Zombie guy, most likely also worked on this crap, since this movie was the only review he has.  And the other 5 star reviewer admits he was drunk when he saw it!!  Seriously....

Unless you have some sort of buzz working, please don't attempt to watch this film.The movie was written, produced, directed, and edited by Shawn Darling. He (I think it is a he.) also did the camera, special make-up, wrote and performed the musical score, and scouted the location. It stars Seth Darling- go figure.This movie is on the order of &#34;Redneck Zombies&#34; but perhaps not quite as &#34;good&#34;. A man dumps chemicals, which look a lot like window washer onto a cemetery out in the dessert. The label claims they are chemicals, but the movie shows them as biological agents. Somehow this creates legions of zombies that appear out of nowhere. In town, James Blackburn plays an auto-mechanic. Phil, his assistant is the village idiot who speaks with a lisp and maybe even some kind of Australian accent. Phil has written a manual on how to combat and survive the undead. (Plot spoiler: He gets eaten early in the film.) Meanwhile there is also a small Renaissance Fair going on out in the middle of nowhere. Vehicles seem to die when zombies are around and the cranking noise, that of a vehicle that won't start, doesn't match the visual of the turning of the key. The acting is bad by design (I think). At one point our group of people is fighting their way through zombies armed with a pipe, tire jacket, and an umbrella (not one of those with a large point, but one that folds in half).If you are a lover of Ed Wood movies, check it out. If you love films with good acting and plot, don't bother.
