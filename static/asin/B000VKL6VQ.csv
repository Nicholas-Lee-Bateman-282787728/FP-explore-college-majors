Technical quality is extremely bad, script, direction and acting are even a little worse than that...In my reviews I complained about the quality of the two actual seasons, calling them a lightweight; well, compared to this ""thing"" they could be considered outstanding achievements.Extras are negligible here as are those in the other two dvds, perhaps even shorter and worse.",1,"about this boxed season 1 + 2 edition, not about the series",1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,868,"['am', 'here', 'reviewing', 'edition', 'reviews', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'please', 'see', 'individual', 'season.I', 'bought', 'boxed', 'set', 'was', 'cheaper', 'getting', 'two', 'seasons', 'separately', 'already', 'got', 'please', 'save', 'money', 'do', 'avoid', 'buying', 'this.As', 'far', 'edition', 'concerned', 'lousy.It', 'boxes', 'season', 'one', 'two', 'right.The', 'third', 'dvd', 'so', 'called', 'lost', 'pilot', 'very', 'crudely', 'filmed', 'attempt', 'first', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'Technical', 'quality', 'extremely', 'bad', 'script', 'direction', 'acting', 'are', 'even', 'little', 'worse', 'reviews', 'complained', 'quality', 'two', 'actual', 'seasons', 'calling', 'lightweight', 'well', 'compared', 'thing', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'outstanding', 'achievements.Extras', 'are', 'negligible', 'here', 'are', 'other', 'two', 'dvds', 'perhaps', 'even', 'shorter', 'worse']",Dante's Cove - Season 1-2 & Original Pilot
