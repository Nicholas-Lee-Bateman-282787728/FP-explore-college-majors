Even if critical information is discovered that saves lives, how many others might ultimately die as a result of the fuel that was added to the fire?Of course the same thing happens to Americans at the hands of the enemy, and it has a dramatic impact on us because it's infuriating, degrading and inhumane. It makes my stomach turn to imagine someone being subjected to pure evil with no regard for the terror and pain they endured.I know someone who fought in WWII. He recently (and reluctantly) told of the torture on both sides, and it still haunts him. Nightmares, flashbacks and images of the torture and murder of individuals who were rendered defenseless and whose lives were in the hands of their captors. I think what bothered him a lot was the fact that he and his peers were convinced they were eradicating evil sub-humans. It was a VERY short period of time considering how long he has lived, but it had a profound effect. It took decades for him to get past an idea that had been drilled into his head: the entire race he'd fought against had no worth. Believing that and then realizing it was not true was its own unique form of torture. He's a good man that believed in his country and followed orders.I was sickened by the details and photos of the P.O.W. torture that certain U.S. soldiers were prosecuted for not long ago. They portrayed our country as heartless sadists to those who know the U.S. only through the media. Who needs propaganda when there's documented proof of depravity? The people they did that to may have committed atrocities, but you gain nothing by lowering yourself to their level. Don't misunderstand me, I sincerely sympathize with those soldiers because of what led them to that point. It may have been driven into their heads, or it could've been fueled by things they had witnessed - maybe even by a specific individual or his/her associates. The person(s) who were interrogated and brutalized may have been downright demented and bloodthirsty, but to return that evil on them is no less depraved. Pack mentality can drive people to drastic behavior, and that's the only way I can begin to comprehend a group of individuals going against every shred of human decency and justifying their decision to use torture as a means to an end.National security is critical to our survival, but there is NO excuse for physically torturing another living being. If you teach people that brutality is acceptable when it comes to defending themselves, where does it stop? If I suspect that someone is guilty of being involved in a violent crime against me or someone I care about, do I have the right to torture them for information? What if I'm wrong? I can't just say, ""Oops! Sorry, I have the wrong guy! You can go now."" The damage is done. Even if I was right, I would be as guilty as that enemy for treating someone inhumanely.Would I shoot an intruder that threatened me or my loved ones? Absolutely, without hesitation. But if I were to blatantly brutalize that person I would be held accountable for it - and rightfully so. There's a good reason why we aren't permitted to threaten others and decide what brand of justice we personally feel is a relative punishment for the crime they've committed against us. There is absolutely no grounds for torturing any living being, not even in battle. Defending yourself is an entirely separate entity from intentionally brutalizing someone or inflicting revenge.",5,"Disturbing, thought-provoking and important",1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,3766,"['do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'really', 'add', 'anything', ""n't"", 'already', 'been', 'said', 'other', 'reviews', 'hard', 'watch', 'saying', 'something.Torture', 'proven', 'be', 'effective', 'forcing', 'people', 'give', 'up', 'information', 'hatred', 'can', 'breed', 'heart', 'enemy', 'can', 'become', 'blind', 'rage', 'focus', 'vengeance', 'Even', 'critical', 'information', 'discovered', 'lives', 'how', 'many', 'others', 'might', 'ultimately', 'die', 'result', 'fuel', 'was', 'added', 'fire', 'course', 'same', 'thing', 'Americans', 'hands', 'enemy', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'infuriating', 'degrading', 'inhumane', 'stomach', 'turn', 'imagine', 'someone', 'being', 'subjected', 'pure', 'evil', 'regard', 'terror', 'pain', 'endured.I', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'fought', 'WWII', 'recently', 'reluctantly', 'told', 'torture', 'sides', 'still', 'Nightmares', 'flashbacks', 'images', 'torture', 'murder', 'individuals', 'who', 'were', 'rendered', 'defenseless', 'lives', 'were', 'hands', 'captors', 'think', 'what', 'bothered', 'lot', 'was', 'fact', 'peers', 'were', 'convinced', 'were', 'eradicating', 'evil', 'sub-humans', 'was', 'VERY', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'considering', 'how', 'long', 'lived', 'had', 'profound', 'effect', 'took', 'decades', 'get', 'idea', 'had', 'been', 'drilled', 'head', 'entire', 'race', ""'d"", 'fought', 'had', 'worth', 'Believing', 'then', 'realizing', 'was', 'not', 'true', 'was', 'own', 'unique', 'form', 'torture', 'good', 'man', 'believed', 'country', 'followed', 'orders.I', 'was', 'sickened', 'details', 'photos', 'P.O.W', 'torture', 'certain', 'U.S.', 'soldiers', 'were', 'prosecuted', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'portrayed', 'country', 'heartless', 'sadists', 'who', 'know', 'U.S.', 'only', 'media', 'Who', 'propaganda', 'when', 'documented', 'proof', 'depravity', 'people', 'did', 'may', 'have', 'committed', 'atrocities', 'gain', 'nothing', 'lowering', 'level', 'Do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', 'sincerely', 'sympathize', 'soldiers', 'what', 'led', 'point', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'driven', 'heads', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fueled', 'things', 'had', 'witnessed', 'maybe', 'even', 'specific', 'individual', 'his/her', 'associates', 'person', 'who', 'were', 'interrogated', 'brutalized', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'downright', 'demented', 'bloodthirsty', 'return', 'evil', 'less', 'depraved', 'Pack', 'mentality', 'can', 'drive', 'people', 'drastic', 'behavior', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'begin', 'comprehend', 'group', 'individuals', 'going', 'shred', 'human', 'decency', 'justifying', 'decision', 'use', 'torture', 'means', 'end.National', 'security', 'critical', 'survival', 'NO', 'excuse', 'physically', 'torturing', 'living', 'being', 'teach', 'people', 'brutality', 'acceptable', 'when', 'defending', 'where', 'stop', 'suspect', 'someone', 'guilty', 'being', 'involved', 'violent', 'crime', 'someone', 'care', 'do', 'have', 'right', 'torture', 'information', 'What', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'say', 'Oops', 'Sorry', 'have', 'wrong', 'guy', 'can', 'go', 'now', 'damage', 'done', 'Even', 'was', 'right', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'guilty', 'enemy', 'treating', 'someone', 'inhumanely.Would', 'shoot', 'intruder', 'threatened', 'loved', 'ones', 'Absolutely', 'hesitation', 'were', 'blatantly', 'brutalize', 'person', 'would', 'be', 'held', 'accountable', 'rightfully', 'so', 'good', 'reason', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'permitted', 'threaten', 'others', 'decide', 'what', 'brand', 'justice', 'personally', 'feel', 'relative', 'punishment', 'crime', ""'ve"", 'committed', 'absolutely', 'grounds', 'torturing', 'living', 'being', 'not', 'even', 'battle', 'Defending', 'entirely', 'separate', 'entity', 'intentionally', 'brutalizing', 'someone', 'inflicting', 'revenge']",N/A

To be different in America could be costly, especially since certain people have gone power mad and have taken it upon themselves to rend lives in a quest which has derailed egalitarianism. The movie did the job of dramatizing what we all know is actually happening, a campaign to enable Americans to enjoy pristine lives. A high caliber cast of actors served to entice me to watch this DVD.When we bred flesh eating monsters in our own backyard what can we expect? This is so unreal.  We must realize that no matter how strenuous the home-cleaning, the effectiveness will be nullified when the next door neighbour nourishes a house full of rats and roaches.  The process of fumigation will cause some innocent ones to suffer collateral damage during the campaign exercise.  This is real!Who is to blame?

1120684,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000YQAMZI,"Cloud ""...""","[0, 2]","Back in the 1960's, people used to protest the Vietnam war by either staging rallies, demonstrations and the likes or, if you could play an instrument, sing a song. Nowadays, the in-thing to do apparently is singing songs and making movies. And ultimately, that's what these films come across as: excuses to rant and make speeches against the evils of whatever the film's subject is about. ""Rendition"", a story centering around a controversial government policy, is that kind of film that doesn't really mind whether you like the film; just as long as it tells you awful and terrible certain things are.Egyptian-born Anwar El-Abrahimi is on his way back to the United States after a trip to see his pregnant wife Isabella and son. But information comes to light that he may have had a conversation with terrorist Rashid Salimi so the US deports him to be ""interrogated"" for information, with brutal questioning methods. Anaylist Douglas Freeman is hired to watch the questioning while the leader, Abasi Fawal, has been the target of assassination attempts with his daughter Fatima perhaps involved somehow. That's not even scratching the surface as we see Isabella asking an old friend/flame Alan Smith for help who has connections to a senator as well as Corinne Whitman, the woman who initially requested the interrogation.Thanks to Paul Haggis (who directed the similarily heavyhanded ""In the Valley of Elah"" and the abysmal ""Crash), I grouped characters in films like this a ""plot puppet"", characters whose sole existence is to stand on whatever side of a subject yet have no real emotional connection to the audience. Sure the actors, namely Meryl Streep and Jake Gyllenhaal, do solid work but they never feel like fully formed characters and just do variations of their central political stance: Streep wants information no matter how, Witherspoon cries and wants her husband back and Gyllenhaal is conflicted about what he's doing. You can praise the acting sure but can't really praise the character itself.The film however does argue a strong point although anyone with common sense will tell you the message before the film even says it. Practices like ""extraordinary rendition"" are inhumane and brutal and has far-reaching consequences for those it touches is kind of obvious. It's like a war movie saying ""war is hell because we kill people"" or an ad saying ""smoking causes cancer"". However, the film did at least bring the attention of the policy in the open and some, like myself who never even heard of it, are now aware of it and can offer opinions to it.If you can get past the rather implausible character connections (watch this: daughter of official is dating guy who wants to kill official who is interrogating a possible terrorist with US employee who is in talks with US senator who started interrogation who meets possible terrorist's husband), it's an alright film but as to what the film wants to be, well it's not here. It's more like a protest speech morphed into a movie.",3,More a message than a movie,1204848000,"03 7, 2008",2008,3000,"['Back', '1960', 'people', 'used', 'protest', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'staging', 'rallies', 'demonstrations', 'likes', 'could', 'play', 'instrument', 'sing', 'song', 'in-thing', 'do', 'apparently', 'singing', 'songs', 'making', 'movies', 'ultimately', 'what', 'films', 'come', 'excuses', 'rant', 'make', 'speeches', 'evils', 'film', 'subject', 'about', 'Rendition', 'story', 'centering', 'controversial', 'government', 'policy', 'kind', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'mind', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'long', 'awful', 'terrible', 'certain', 'things', 'are.Egyptian-born', 'Anwar', 'El-Abrahimi', 'way', 'back', 'United', 'States', 'trip', 'see', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Isabella', 'son', 'information', 'light', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'conversation', 'terrorist', 'Rashid', 'Salimi', 'US', 'be', 'interrogated', 'information', 'brutal', 'questioning', 'methods', 'Anaylist', 'Douglas', 'Freeman', 'hired', 'watch', 'questioning', 'leader', 'Abasi', 'Fawal', 'been', 'target', 'assassination', 'attempts', 'daughter', 'Fatima', 'perhaps', 'involved', 'somehow', 'not', 'even', 'scratching', 'surface', 'see', 'Isabella', 'asking', 'old', 'friend/flame', 'Alan', 'Smith', 'help', 'who', 'connections', 'senator', 'as', 'well', 'Corinne', 'Whitman', 'woman', 'who', 'initially', 'requested', 'interrogation.Thanks', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'who', 'directed', 'similarily', 'heavyhanded', 'Valley', 'Elah', 'abysmal', 'Crash', 'grouped', 'characters', 'films', 'plot', 'puppet', 'characters', 'sole', 'existence', 'stand', 'side', 'subject', 'yet', 'have', 'real', 'emotional', 'connection', 'audience', 'Sure', 'actors', 'namely', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'do', 'solid', 'work', 'never', 'feel', 'fully', 'formed', 'characters', 'just', 'do', 'variations', 'central', 'political', 'stance', 'Streep', 'information', 'matter', 'how', 'Witherspoon', 'cries', 'husband', 'back', 'Gyllenhaal', 'conflicted', 'what', 'doing', 'can', 'praise', 'acting', 'sure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'praise', 'character', 'itself.The', 'film', 'however', 'argue', 'strong', 'point', 'anyone', 'common', 'sense', 'will', 'tell', 'message', 'film', 'even', 'Practices', 'extraordinary', 'rendition', 'are', 'inhumane', 'brutal', 'far-reaching', 'consequences', 'kind', 'obvious', 'war', 'movie', 'saying', 'war', 'hell', 'kill', 'people', 'ad', 'saying', 'smoking', 'cancer', 'However', 'film', 'did', 'least', 'bring', 'attention', 'policy', 'open', 'who', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'are', 'now', 'aware', 'can', 'offer', 'opinions', 'it.If', 'can', 'get', 'rather', 'implausible', 'character', 'connections', 'watch', 'daughter', 'official', 'dating', 'guy', 'who', 'kill', 'official', 'who', 'interrogating', 'possible', 'terrorist', 'US', 'employee', 'who', 'talks', 'US', 'senator', 'who', 'started', 'interrogation', 'who', 'possible', 'terrorist', 'husband', 'alright', 'film', 'what', 'film', 'be', 'well', 'not', 'here', 'more', 'protest', 'speech', 'morphed', 'movie']",N/A

1120687,A3IL3LL7F06GCF,B000YQAMZI,Demon_Mustang,"[15, 32]","This movie was actually split into two stories. It seemed like one of them was the original premise of the movie and the other was thrown in last minute to take advantage of the current political climate. The first follows a young girl who finds herself entangled with a young boy who is involved in an Islamic terrorist group. The other follows an Arab-American who is taken to another country (Egypt if I remember correctly) for interrogation after intelligence found phone numbers in his call list that were tied to known terrorist numbers.It is this latter story line that really falls apart. First of all, they are completely misrepresenting the premise of Rendition. Rendition is used when a suspected terrorist is caught OFF AMERICAN SOIL, which limits their rights to what we know as due process since technically they are not an American prisoner. Rendition is basically just a way to get information quicker instead of bringing them back to the United States and going through the judicial system, you take advantage of the fact that you found the person in another country and you keep them there or fly them to another country for interrogation. In this movie, the character is arrested in an American airport, and he is magically erased from the record by clicking a mouse button on a computer terminal. Of course the movie makers forget about paper trails, the eye witnesses, etc.Then through the entire movie, they are supposed to convince you that this person is in fact innocent, and is being held unjustly. But of course, typical political movie, they do this through emotion instead of through actual facts because they NEVER really explain why he had those phone calls from those numbers. Never did he simply say ""oh, that number is my uncle's"" through the entire movie, we all know he had calls from these numbers, but every time they show him the number or mentions it, all he ever says is ""I don't know."" Come on, I understand it's hard to remember all numbers especially now that you have them all saved on your cell phone, but at least attempt to explain. Even by the end of the movie, they never really explained it. They simply briefly mentioned something about numbers being disposable and they hoped you would buy into that ""coincidence"" junk and not think about it any further.For me, this was a cop-out. They couldn't find a witty way to explain away these things in a way that would justify the mistaken identity and his innocence at the same time, so instead they just throw in a lot of sensationalism to stir up emotions to try to take your attention away from these obvious loop holes. I'm sorry if I give away a spoiler here, I guess skip over this paragraph if you don't want to hear anything. Another loop hole is the fact that they claim there's a fail-safe in case a bomber ever changes his mind about blowing himself up, a gunman would shoot him and set off the explosive that way (when the detonator switch is released and the spoon releases the striker). So in the movie, the bomber and the gunman watching him, are both within 50 meters of their intended target, and the gunman has a CLEAR shot at BOTH the bomber, AND the intended target. When the gunman saw that the bomber might not go through with it, why did he even bother shooting the bomber when you have a clear and easy shot at the target itself??? When you watch the movie, you'll see what I mean; the gunman could have EASILY taken out the target since the target was not moving, outdoors, with no cover...Anyway, the movie is mildly entertaining, primarily the side story with the girl and the terrorist boy, but other than that, the plot is full of holes and over dramatic unrealistic acting from Reese Witherspoon, at no fault of her own, the script is just full of the typical over-romanticized, overly dramatic dialogue that if not performed in a similar fashion would seem very corny. And then Meryl Streep's character is supposed to play some high role in the Pentagon and this lawyer gets her to admit to Rendition's role in the main character's disappearance within 3 lines. I mean seriously, high ranking government officials like that are much better at denying things and being persistent in keeping information from falling into the wrong hands than that. But apparently it's easy to get her to admit to anything.

1120688,AY1HVIM2V067E,B000YQAMZI,"Edward G. Nilges ""Author, 'Build Your Own .Ne...","[4, 10]","I'm not sure if it was intentional, but on my copy, bought in Hong Kong, there were Chinese subtitles for the subplot, which was spoken in Arabic (or, perhaps, another Middle Eastern language), but no English subtitles.It is then perhaps an accidental tribute to the filmmakers that the film still works. It makes the film more global and decenters the American viewer: yes, after September 11, Americans have to give up control of knowledge: yes, there are other people, and no, the narcissism must have a stop.As to a ""liberal agenda"". It happened to be on the agenda at Runnymede, it was in fact on the Barons' liberal agenda when they forced King John to sign Magna Carta, and the ability to override habeus corpus is not a fit subject for debate in a society claiming to be democratic.Conservatives like duh-bate, and putting everything up for grabs. But guess what: IF you can be imprisoned arbitrarily and for an arbitrary length of time, then you cannot participate in a duh-bate. As Habermas has shown, the very possibility of debate (whether informed or one of those conservative, phoney duh-bates) is preconditioned on rights.The ""agenda"" of rendition is to get us to identify, just enough, with a man who's taken away and locked up without rights.Well, I'll be dipped. The film has an agenda. So did Indiana Jones (western hegemony, with a stupid grin).Incommunicado. It's a weird feeling. I was tossed by mistake into the adult lockup at Chicago police HQ at the age of 15 for participating in a civil rights demonstration.So when am I getting out of here? Do I get a baloney sandwich? Where's Mom?I was guilty as charged and they let me go. Now, suppose you're not guilty.Feels bad, doesn't it, and in a way that has a social dimension. It makes you reconsider your relations with your fellows in a deep way and say, this should never happen.""Zero tolerance"" in domestic American law is basically the idea that in order to prevent drug and sex crimes, it is better to be safe than sorry, and lock up people for sentences, sometimes for victimless crimes, and sometimes when they are innocent. The punishment of a purely innocent person is considered to be a cost factor.It's an interesting cost, since we don't pay it, the victim pays the cost and is never recompensed, whether he's someone locked up mistakenly in a domestic prison, or someone who is ""rendered"".In a dark-star turn, Meryl Streep argues for extraordinary rendition. She claims that it prevented a London incident.This makes no sense. If you detain the wrong guy, you haven't prevented anything and are wasting scarce cop resources (including baloney sandwiches).If you have whom you think is the right guy, what's wrong with waking up a judge? The argument here is the need for secrecy; you don't want the bad guys to know you've nailed one of them.This manages to significantly exagerrate the value of police and military intelligence. In his book on military intelligence, John Keegan, the British military writer, shows that it is almost never critical to war-winning, and in the case of the ""war on terror"", your adversaries will rarely profit from knowing which of their real operatives you've taken down.The ""war on terror"" will be won when the United States stops sponsoring almost every decision made by the Israelis, and stops using military force to try to obtain oil reserves. It would be better fought in the open by a USA that simply refuses to stop being a country ruled by laws.Do we become a Fascist society if one person is denied habeus corpus? Isn't this a Godwin convergence, similar to the way that internet conversations converge towards comparisions to Hitler? Is it some sort of bad behavior to get rowdy, and start calling people and societies Fascist when someone we don't even know is violated?I think we do. Recently, Tim Berners-Lee has warned people that they are leaving too much information about themselves on the Internet. It didn't occur to him to question why we should worry. One of the reasons given was that marketers would know too much about us.But what was interesting is that Berners-Lee assumes as given a need for anonymity.What are we all scared of? Being a victim, whether of job loss or extraordinary rendition?Why do we have to go on like this?",5,Liberal agenda?

1120689,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B000YQAMZI,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[1, 3]","""Rendition"" is two stories that converge at the climax. The first is of a legal alien, chemical engineer, married to an American citizen. The second is a police official from a North African nation who's independent-minded daughter has not been home for seven days. He wants her to return and prepare for the marriage he has arranged.Anwar El-Ibrahimi, played by Omar Metwally is abducted as he lands in Washington D. C. where his name is erased from the passenger manifest. He is hooded, isolated, questioned, and not allowed to make contact with anyone. The order to have him abducted has already been given by a government official, Corrine Whitman who is played by Meryl Streep. She plays the part of an arrogant, calculating, you-know-what. As a government director she is confident, and wields her power without remorse.Reese Witherspoon is the wife of Anwar El-Ibrahimi. While the airline denies that he is a passenger, she discovers that he was checked in on the flight from Johannesburg, and used his credit card for duty-free purchases on the flight home, but there is no husband at arrivals.The decision is made to take Ibrahimi to an unnamed North African nation for rendition. Here we get to see how he is stripped, racked, confined, shackled, and water boarded. A C.I.A. analyst (Jake Gyllenhaall) watches as he is the default person in place, after a public square explosion hours earlier killed his colleague. The bomb was the second attempt on the official's life.This story is not about anyone in particular, but it does bear a resemblance to the Canadian citizen who was abducted by Americans with the complicity of the head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who eventually resigned in disgrace. This also represents what has been going on here in the land of the free, and this is the most frightening part for me as I am a life-long believer that Americans would never tolerate such a policy but would rebel against it. The story spells out clearly that rendition was started in the Clinton administration in one of his bids to move more to the center or right to please conservatives who would never accept him anyway.  The movie also makes clear that 9/11 especially in the hands of a President who believed he could do no wrong or a Vice President who didn't care if he did or didn't, would use rendition so often.Without telling you the remainder of the storyline, the one thing ""Rendition"" lacked for me was suspense. Only one part of the ending came as a surprise, and I have already alluded to that two times in this review. Part of the end was farfetched and divorced from reality, even if it did somewhat satisfy my sense of justice and retribution. The cast and casting were superb, but the music, unfortunately sounded like it was borrowed from ""Gladiator""  and ""Troy."" It must be a very popular style lately.The DVD also includes special features. These are ""Outlawed"" documentary which is excellent for only twenty plus minutes, ""Intersections: the Making of Rendition"" Documentary, five deleted scenes including an alternate ending, and director commentary.After World War II, the American army forced the local German civilians to view the corpses in over 100 death camps they ""never knew"" existed. The purpose was to ensure that the Germans could never deny what happened. Seventy years later, it is time for Americans to do the same by watching this picture as a start to learn all about the torture we have committed and caused in the name of security or even freedom, while claiming to be a nation governed by the rule of law.You won't want to miss this, but you won't want to watch it either.",4,A Picture You Won't Want to Miss and Won't Want to Watch,1243468800,"05 28, 2009",2009,3636,"['Rendition', 'two', 'stories', 'converge', 'climax', 'first', 'legal', 'alien', 'chemical', 'engineer', 'married', 'American', 'citizen', 'second', 'police', 'official', 'North', 'African', 'nation', 'who', 'independent-minded', 'daughter', 'not', 'been', 'home', 'seven', 'days', 'return', 'prepare', 'marriage', 'arranged.Anwar', 'El-Ibrahimi', 'played', 'Omar', 'Metwally', 'abducted', 'Washington', 'D.', 'C.', 'where', 'name', 'erased', 'passenger', 'manifest', 'hooded', 'isolated', 'questioned', 'not', 'allowed', 'make', 'contact', 'anyone', 'order', 'have', 'abducted', 'already', 'been', 'given', 'government', 'official', 'Corrine', 'Whitman', 'who', 'played', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'part', 'arrogant', 'calculating', 'you-know-what', 'government', 'director', 'confident', 'power', 'remorse.Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'wife', 'Anwar', 'El-Ibrahimi', 'airline', 'passenger', 'was', 'checked', 'flight', 'Johannesburg', 'used', 'credit', 'card', 'duty-free', 'purchases', 'flight', 'home', 'husband', 'arrivals.The', 'decision', 'made', 'take', 'Ibrahimi', 'unnamed', 'North', 'African', 'nation', 'rendition', 'Here', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'stripped', 'racked', 'confined', 'shackled', 'water', 'boarded', 'C.I.A', 'analyst', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaall', 'default', 'person', 'place', 'public', 'square', 'explosion', 'hours', 'earlier', 'killed', 'colleague', 'bomb', 'was', 'second', 'attempt', 'official', 'life.This', 'story', 'not', 'anyone', 'particular', 'bear', 'resemblance', 'Canadian', 'citizen', 'who', 'was', 'abducted', 'Americans', 'complicity', 'head', 'Royal', 'Canadian', 'Mounted', 'Police', 'who', 'eventually', 'resigned', 'disgrace', 'also', 'been', 'going', 'here', 'land', 'free', 'most', 'frightening', 'part', 'am', 'life-long', 'believer', 'Americans', 'would', 'never', 'tolerate', 'such', 'policy', 'would', 'rebel', 'story', 'out', 'clearly', 'rendition', 'was', 'started', 'Clinton', 'administration', 'one', 'bids', 'move', 'more', 'center', 'right', 'please', 'conservatives', 'who', 'would', 'never', 'accept', 'anyway', 'movie', 'also', 'clear', '9/11', 'especially', 'hands', 'President', 'who', 'believed', 'could', 'do', 'wrong', 'Vice', 'President', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'would', 'use', 'rendition', 'so', 'telling', 'remainder', 'storyline', 'one', 'thing', 'Rendition', 'lacked', 'was', 'suspense', 'Only', 'one', 'part', 'ending', 'came', 'surprise', 'have', 'already', 'alluded', 'two', 'times', 'review', 'Part', 'end', 'was', 'farfetched', 'divorced', 'reality', 'even', 'did', 'somewhat', 'satisfy', 'sense', 'justice', 'retribution', 'cast', 'casting', 'were', 'superb', 'music', 'unfortunately', 'sounded', 'was', 'borrowed', 'Gladiator', 'Troy', 'must', 'be', 'very', 'popular', 'style', 'lately.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'Outlawed', 'documentary', 'excellent', 'only', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'Intersections', 'Making', 'Rendition', 'Documentary', 'five', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'including', 'alternate', 'ending', 'director', 'commentary.After', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'American', 'army', 'forced', 'local', 'German', 'civilians', 'view', 'corpses', '100', 'death', 'camps', 'never', 'knew', 'existed', 'purpose', 'was', 'ensure', 'Germans', 'could', 'never', 'deny', 'what', 'happened', 'Seventy', 'years', 'later', 'time', 'Americans', 'do', 'same', 'watching', 'picture', 'start', 'learn', 'torture', 'have', 'committed', 'caused', 'name', 'security', 'even', 'freedom', 'claiming', 'be', 'nation', 'governed', 'rule', 'law.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch']",N/A

It is definitely a message film but that message is delivered by a smart script, a compassionate director, and a dream cast.But first the word rendition: according to the dictionary, ""In law, rendition is a ""surrender"" or ""handing over"" of persons or property, particularly from one jurisdiction to another. For criminal suspects, extradition is the most common type of rendition. Rendition can also be seen as the act of handing over, after the request for extradition has taken place.""  For many this may not be news, but for those who are not privy to our Intelligence games, the concept is a terrifying one.  For this film Kelley Sane has provided director Gavin Hood with a script that examines the horrors of rendition and in doing so the two have created a story we simply cannot ignore.Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) is an Egyptian-born American working in South Africa as the film begins: his very pregnant wife Isabella (Reese Witherspoon) awaits his return home but when Anwar doesn't appear at the airport, the enigma begins.  Anwar has been taken prisoner in Egypt where he is tortured and interrogated for information by the cruel Abasi Fawal (Yigal Naor) while a reluctant CIA investigator Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal) stands by, the two attempting to extract secrets to be provided to the USA: behind the scenes in Washington DC the extraordinary rendition is piloted by Intelligence expert Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep).  Isabella attempts to uncover the truth of her missing husband's whereabouts and involves an old friend (Peter Sarsgaard) to help her.  Nothing goes well, not in the US or in Egypt, where the interrogator Abasi discovers the evil that is brewing within his own family. It is Isabella's persistence, Anwar's endurance,  and the ultimate heroism of Douglas Freeman that allow the resolution to the nightmare.The cast is uniformly strong, the grim realities of the torture chambers are almost unbearable to watch, and the in-our-face discovery of how our Intelligence system works (especially since 911) is terrifying. Added to the DVD is a short film about two men who talk about personal experiences with 'rendition'.  It is a kick in the gut and demands action from the viewer to become an activist in preventing the continuation of these tactics.

Lame.The plot: a Hitchcockian case of mistaken identity* occurs when Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), a mild-mannered chemical engineer receives phone calls from a terrorist.  Anwar is quickly whisked away to Morocco to be waterboarded and electrocuted to get him to talk.  CIA kidstuff Douglas Freeman (Jake ""Brokeback Mountain"" Gyllenhaal),  under the direction of Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) observes the interrogations and his liberal sensibilities are shocked to the core, so he plots to free the man.  Meanwhile, the Moroccan interrogator Abasi Fawal (Yigal Naor) has his daughter falling for a brooding jihadi, giving us a new twist on Romeo and Juliet as well as a whole new meaning for the term ""banging your girlfriend.""Joking aside, the movie was slow, predictable, preachy, one-sided, and frankly didn't make too much sense when the rendition part and the Romeo and Juliet part came together.  Abasi interrogates Anwar about the person accused of a bomb blast actually occurring in the future?  It gets very confusing.  There was some nice cinematography though, and the movie at least gives us the general truth that terrorism nowadays is primarily a Mohammedan-on-Mohammedan affair, a point that is frequently lost to both Hollywood and the American public.  So, it's not at the bottom of the agitprop barrel.*  Maybe.  We never do learn just why it was that Rashid the Terrorist was phoning our renditioned hero.  Maybe another waterboarding session would've broken him; you never know.2009 UPDATE TO MY 2008 REVIEWHeadline from the L.A.

1120694,A2Y3CWITEF9JGY,B000YQAMZI,"JP Salazar ""Web Developer""","[12, 27]","Will this new wave of ""war on terror"" movies ever end? Almost none of them work because: they don't change people's opinions, they pretend to be morally superior (self-importance), they give us the wrong impressions and their messages are way too bias--this is Hollywood after all and we all know which side of the political spectrum they're on--to even take any of them seriously. In the end, these movies turn out to be more offensive (even for the Arabs) than anything else. I'm certain that whatever is happening behind the government's curtain is far more dramatic and interesting than boring films like Rendition--heck! At least The Kingdom had action in it. Not only the film is uninspiring, boring and extremely long, the A-class American actors are so lifeless that seem to be ""pasted"" into the film. I surrendered to Rendition after an hour and change. The real suffering is watching it.Brief Intro Story:An explosion in North Africa generates an investigation to find out the perpetrators--one American is killed. A little bit after that incident, family man Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) is kidnapped at the airport by a secret ""law enforcement"" agency--He was supposed catch a plane from South Africa to Chicago. Apparently he is now a suspect of terrorism and taken to a secret location for interrogation--He is a legal US resident and apparently innocent. Meanwhile rookie CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to observe the brutal interrogation of Anwar by the local law enforcement--he was near that explosion, he wants to do his job, but doesn't like what he sees.After waiting for few days, Isabella (Reese Witherspoon) begins to investigate the disappearance of her husband--she is pregnant, but this doesn't stop her from finding out the truth. As the film continues, Douglas begins to have second thoughts about his job and the real truth behind that explosion appears for all to see.Review:Director Gavin Hood makes a bad mistake by creating two parallel stories with no success in any of them. In one hand we have a ""Romeo and Juliet"" soapy Arab love story, and in the other, we get the laid-back and boring CIA agent Douglas who doesn't do much but getting laid, watches poor Anwar being tortured for few days, but all of the sudden, he wants to do the right thing by going against US policy on terror and trying to understand and even help the prisoner--which is not his call. How exciting is that? Even though, these stories are related, the movie jumps from scene to scene lacking the notion of time with fuzzy continuity. This non-chronological approach (done better in other films) unfortunately is not the only editing issue; the film is extremely long (120 minutes). Too long for a film that has virtually no action sequences, but little character development and few forced dramatic moments--for example the torture scenes for the most part, but they are not that shocking.Many of you are wondering why I didn't mention in my introduction that this film has Academy Award-winning Meryl Streep and Academy Award-winning Alan Arkin. What is wrong with this picture? The problem is the way our actors portray their clich&eacute; characters--yes, those evil, heartless government officials in charge of the war on terror (I'm being sarcastic here). In other words, our American actors have very little material--and screen time--to work with. They are nothing but stereotypes that show no emotions even in dire straits situations and at times, seem to be bored to even be in the film. It's an easy paycheck after all. But why is it about Oscar winners that after getting one statue, they get bad roles?The Verdict:Rendition has an agenda and clearly displays it by showing its own view of what's happening to detainees in this messy War on Terror. Of course, you would expect this kind of bias from Hollywood. The real issue here is that the movie is way too slow; it has cero character development with boring performances and clich&eacute; stereotypes--except for few scenes from the prisoner that are quite dramatic--that doesn't inspire nor entertain us. Please do yourself a favor and watch other far better dramas about this issue like Syriana.",2,Rendition has an agenda and clearly displays it,1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,4204,"['Will', 'new', 'wave', 'war', 'terror', 'movies', 'ever', 'end', 'Almost', 'none', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'people', 'opinions', 'pretend', 'be', 'morally', 'superior', 'self-importance', 'give', 'wrong', 'impressions', 'messages', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'bias', 'Hollywood', 'know', 'side', 'political', 'spectrum', ""'re"", 'even', 'take', 'seriously', 'end', 'movies', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'more', 'offensive', 'even', 'Arabs', 'anything', 'else', ""'m"", 'certain', 'happening', 'government', 'curtain', 'far', 'more', 'dramatic', 'interesting', 'boring', 'films', 'Rendition', 'heck', 'least', 'Kingdom', 'had', 'action', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'uninspiring', 'boring', 'extremely', 'long', 'A-class', 'American', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'lifeless', 'seem', 'be', 'pasted', 'film', 'surrendered', 'Rendition', 'hour', 'change', 'real', 'suffering', 'watching', 'it.Brief', 'Intro', 'Story', 'explosion', 'North', 'Africa', 'investigation', 'find', 'out', 'perpetrators', 'one', 'American', 'killed', 'little', 'bit', 'incident', 'family', 'man', 'Anwar', 'El-Ibrahimi', 'Omar', 'Metwally', 'kidnapped', 'airport', 'secret', 'law', 'enforcement', 'agency', 'was', 'supposed', 'catch', 'plane', 'South', 'Africa', 'Chicago', 'Apparently', 'now', 'suspect', 'terrorism', 'taken', 'secret', 'location', 'interrogation', 'legal', 'US', 'resident', 'apparently', 'innocent', 'Meanwhile', 'rookie', 'CIA', 'analyst', 'Douglas', 'Freeman', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'assigned', 'observe', 'brutal', 'interrogation', 'Anwar', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'was', 'explosion', 'do', 'job', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'sees.After', 'waiting', 'few', 'days', 'Isabella', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'investigate', 'disappearance', 'husband', 'pregnant', ""n't"", 'stop', 'finding', 'out', 'truth', 'film', 'Douglas', 'have', 'second', 'thoughts', 'job', 'real', 'truth', 'explosion', 'see.Review', 'Director', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'bad', 'mistake', 'creating', 'two', 'parallel', 'stories', 'success', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'soapy', 'Arab', 'love', 'story', 'other', 'get', 'laid-back', 'boring', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Douglas', 'who', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'getting', 'laid', 'watches', 'poor', 'Anwar', 'being', 'tortured', 'few', 'days', 'sudden', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'going', 'US', 'policy', 'terror', 'trying', 'understand', 'even', 'help', 'prisoner', 'not', 'call', 'How', 'exciting', 'Even', 'stories', 'are', 'related', 'movie', 'jumps', 'scene', 'scene', 'lacking', 'notion', 'time', 'fuzzy', 'continuity', 'non-chronological', 'approach', 'done', 'better', 'other', 'films', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'only', 'editing', 'issue', 'film', 'extremely', 'long', '120', 'minutes', 'Too', 'long', 'film', 'virtually', 'action', 'sequences', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'few', 'forced', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'example', 'torture', 'scenes', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'not', 'shocking.Many', 'are', 'wondering', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'introduction', 'film', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'What', 'wrong', 'picture', 'problem', 'way', 'actors', 'portray', 'clich', 'eacute', 'characters', 'yes', 'evil', 'heartless', 'government', 'officials', 'charge', 'war', 'terror', ""'m"", 'being', 'sarcastic', 'here', 'other', 'words', 'American', 'actors', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'material', 'screen', 'time', 'work', 'are', 'nothing', 'show', 'emotions', 'even', 'dire', 'straits', 'situations', 'times', 'seem', 'be', 'bored', 'even', 'be', 'film', 'easy', 'paycheck', 'why', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'getting', 'one', 'statue', 'get', 'bad', 'roles', 'Verdict', 'Rendition', 'agenda', 'clearly', 'displays', 'showing', 'own', 'view', 'what', 'happening', 'detainees', 'messy', 'War', 'Terror', 'course', 'would', 'expect', 'kind', 'bias', 'Hollywood', 'real', 'issue', 'here', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'slow', 'cero', 'character', 'development', 'boring', 'performances', 'clich', 'eacute', 'stereotypes', 'few', 'scenes', 'prisoner', 'are', 'quite', 'dramatic', ""n't"", 'inspire', 'entertain', 'Please', 'do', 'favor', 'watch', 'other', 'far', 'better', 'dramas', 'issue', 'Syriana']",N/A
1120695,A10872FHIJAKKD,B000YQAMZI,Just Bill,"[12, 31]","SPOILERS AHEAD...I didn't know what the movie was about before we bought it. My wife and I like Reese Witherspoon and have a passing interesting in Jake Gyllenhaal. We thought it was a thriller about a guy who disappears on a transatlantic flight, a cool premise for a movie. Granted, a guy disappears in this movie, but not while in flight. He's apprehended, under suspicion of terrorist activities, by the U.S. authorities and flown back to a country that employs torture to extract information.On that level, Rendition is a thinly veiled anti-torture treatise. Nothing more. It's certainly not a well-crafted movie.While we watched, we cringed at:1. The snail's pace of virtually every scene,2. The emotionally stifled acting,3. The torture scenes4. The confusing back-and-forth time jumps (think LOST without the clever writing and directing)5. The confusing, way-too-many-characters-to-be-understood plotThere's really not much else to say about this movie. We could barely follow the story, and we had an extremely difficult time differentiating the actors -- or even caring about them. Jake's character was supposed to be tortured emotionally. Yet all he seemed is emotionless and dull-witted. Reese Withersoon's character was supposed to be tortured emotionally because she couldn't find her husband. Yet she only lost her cool in one scene. A very pregnant woman whose husband disappears would come unglued! Reese's character acted like her husband forgot to buy the potato chips for the afternoon BBQ. Mild irritation, rather than outright panic.Too many subplots, characters, and settings made this movie a painful experience. My wife and I kept saying to each other, ""No one would say that in this situation"" or ""No one would do that in those circumstances.""In short, this movie was poorly written, sluggishly directed, and a total waste of our time.In the end, two questions remained unanswered:1. Was Reese's husband really guilty? The movie left open the possibility th at the terrorist had indeed called him, and2. Is torture justifiable if it's used to save lives?The subject matter was handled so ham-fistedly that nothing was answered. And the characters were so black-and-white that (a) the good guys were bad for believing in torture, and (b) the bad guys were good for resorting to terrorism to combat the unfairness of torture.Bottom line: If you watch Rendition, don't expect to be wowed by the acting (there really isn't any to speak of), or a cleverly written plot (nothing clever about this movie), or a well-balanced message that makes you think. This movie is a sludge hammer, not a scalpel. It's more apt to knock you unconscious than it is to awaken slumbering brain cells.I can't recommend this movie at all, on any level.

For that, and that only, I give it 3 stars.Two flaws in the film are the selection of two male leads who look too much alike, for no apparent purpose in the film.  The other flaw was a supposedly clever surprise flashback, that the viewer finds impossible.  Why do that?Yet, the real problem with this film is its message.  Not until the sappy/contrived ending do we find out that we've been lured into a trap to feel sorry for the misunderstood, wrongly-suspected, upstanding Muslims living among us here in America.Maybe I should have seen it coming by the film's use of weepy instrumental music throughout.  Maybe I should have guessed that because the top American actress/actor is Meryl Streep, the message would once again be blame-America-first.  (Remember her in: Deer Hunter (1979), Silkwood (1983), A Cry In The Dark (1988)(blaming English-speaking Australia), First Do No Harm (1997), and Manchurian Candidate (2004).)By use of flashing from one scene to the other, the movie presents a dual climax.  The one storyline is the ""likeable"" young Muslim lover guy... strapped with bombs... who sheds tears as he walks toward the father of his girlfriend to blow him up along with the entire village square.  Pardon me if I don't wipe a tear from my own eye, moved by his ""love"" for his approaching girlfriend.  Nor did I get a tear for the girlfriend who apologetically pleads for him to consider sparing her about-to-be-killed father (no, she does not warn her father).The other crescendo scene (interspersed with the ""likeable"" terrorist climax) is the unjaded wooden-faced American CIA upstart courageously rescuing an Egyptian-born abductee.  By this late scene of the movie, the viewer is supposed to have joined with this CIA onlooker to be disgusted by the torture techniques (done for the USA, but in a Muslim country).  The viewer is supposedly convinced that the Americanized bomb scientist who just happened to have been in frequent contact with Muslim terrorists, is obviously innocent (because he says he is).While this movie was in the making, I was shown (along with a group of other attorneys) a proposed movie clip of a Muslim detainee pleading his case in a similar ""rendition"" courtroom.  That script matched this movie's script almost word for word.  We were then treated to a telephone conference with one of the actors.  While denying he had any agenda, he suggested that all such detainees are as wrongly suspected as the character in their theatrical creation.These propaganda efforts offer a thin veil to, not just alternative reasonable views, but to the world's most intentionally violent and vindictive group.Maybe Meryl Streep's next movie can take on the personal challenge of presenting something she likes about America.",3,Terrorists Get Victim Status,1264636800,"01 28, 2010",2010,2824,"['film', 'highly', 'engaging', 'well', 'paced', 'skillfully', 'filmed', 'only', 'give', '3', 'stars.Two', 'flaws', 'film', 'are', 'selection', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'who', 'look', 'too', 'much', 'alike', 'apparent', 'purpose', 'film', 'other', 'flaw', 'was', 'supposedly', 'clever', 'surprise', 'flashback', 'viewer', 'finds', 'impossible', 'Why', 'do', 'Yet', 'real', 'problem', 'film', 'message', 'Not', 'sappy/contrived', 'ending', 'do', 'find', 'out', ""'ve"", 'been', 'lured', 'trap', 'feel', 'sorry', 'misunderstood', 'wrongly-suspected', 'upstanding', 'Muslims', 'living', 'here', 'America.Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'seen', 'coming', 'film', 'use', 'weepy', 'instrumental', 'music', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'guessed', 'top', 'American', 'actress/actor', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'message', 'would', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'blame-America-first', 'Remember', 'Deer', 'Hunter', '1979', 'Silkwood', '1983', 'Cry', 'Dark', '1988', 'blaming', 'English-speaking', 'Australia', 'First', 'Do', 'No', 'Harm', '1997', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', '2004', 'use', 'flashing', 'one', 'scene', 'other', 'movie', 'dual', 'climax', 'one', 'storyline', 'likeable', 'young', 'Muslim', 'lover', 'guy', 'strapped', 'bombs', 'who', 'tears', 'father', 'girlfriend', 'blow', 'up', 'entire', 'village', 'square', 'Pardon', 'do', ""n't"", 'wipe', 'tear', 'own', 'eye', 'moved', 'love', 'approaching', 'girlfriend', 'did', 'get', 'tear', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'apologetically', 'pleads', 'consider', 'sparing', 'about-to-be-killed', 'father', 'not', 'warn', 'father', 'other', 'crescendo', 'scene', 'interspersed', 'likeable', 'terrorist', 'climax', 'unjaded', 'wooden-faced', 'American', 'CIA', 'upstart', 'courageously', 'rescuing', 'Egyptian-born', 'abductee', 'late', 'scene', 'movie', 'viewer', 'supposed', 'have', 'joined', 'CIA', 'onlooker', 'be', 'disgusted', 'torture', 'techniques', 'done', 'USA', 'Muslim', 'country', 'viewer', 'supposedly', 'convinced', 'Americanized', 'bomb', 'scientist', 'who', 'just', 'happened', 'have', 'been', 'frequent', 'contact', 'Muslim', 'terrorists', 'obviously', 'innocent', 'movie', 'was', 'making', 'was', 'shown', 'group', 'other', 'attorneys', 'proposed', 'movie', 'clip', 'Muslim', 'detainee', 'pleading', 'case', 'similar', 'rendition', 'courtroom', 'script', 'matched', 'movie', 'script', 'almost', 'word', 'word', 'were', 'then', 'treated', 'telephone', 'conference', 'one', 'actors', 'denying', 'had', 'agenda', 'suggested', 'such', 'detainees', 'are', 'wrongly', 'suspected', 'character', 'theatrical', 'creation.These', 'propaganda', 'efforts', 'offer', 'thin', 'veil', 'not', 'just', 'alternative', 'reasonable', 'views', 'world', 'most', 'intentionally', 'violent', 'vindictive', 'group.Maybe', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'next', 'movie', 'can', 'take', 'personal', 'challenge', 'presenting', 'something', 'America']",N/A

It's got a cast of A-list reliables, a multi-award winning director and a provocative topic as its central plot. It should have been a fantastic, thought-provoking look at the U.S. Government's treatment of terrorism, but instead, it's an unfortunate blend of three insipid storylines tied together with one of those horrible Pulp Fiction-style chronology twists, and it doesn't manage to do anything interesting or say anything original.Egyptian-born Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Metwally) is apprehended by the C.I.A. upon his return to the United States. CIA bigwig Corrine Whitman (Streep) believes him to be responsible for a terrorist attack in Africa which killed a U.S. Government official and, despite the lack of any evidence, she returns him for torturous interrogation to the country of the attack. Meanwhile, back in the U.S., his pregnant wife (Witherspoon) mounts a missing persons campaign that reaches all the way to Washington, and in Northern Africa, reluctant CIA operative Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal) does his best to assist Anwar's plight.Performances are full of gusto all-round - it's particularly nice to see Reece Witherspoon actually acting (albeit not brilliantly), in a film whose plot doesn't centre on how lovely-girls-attract-lovely-men, and Metwally and Gyllenhaal give decent turns in their respective captive/captor roles. Zineb Oukach and Yigal Naor are good as Fatima and Abasi - even if the strained nature of their daughter vs.father / left vs. right relationship is left largely unexplored. Unfortunately, Streep is surprisingly underused, and what's there of her performance is unconvincing and one-dimensional, and Moa Khouas as would-be terrorist operative Khalid is childish and annoying.""Rendition"" has an appalling script. The badly-written dialogue splits into three distinct threads: the bleeding-heart pleading of Witherspoon versus the crusty flintiness of Streep and her officials, the ""Why-did-you-do-it?"" repetitive torture of Gyllenhaal's scenes with Metwally, and the foreign language dialogue - which, reading the subtitles, is as lukewarm as the rest of the film, but, since it's not in English, one could be forgiven for thinking it more impressive than it actually is. Unfortunately, the wishy-washiness of the script mirrors the blandness of these three plot threads, and none of them is resolved with any kind of spirit or originality - nor does any of them manage to make you really care about the characters or events they're describing.The characters are not developed well - if at all: the only one who seems to go on any sort of emotional journey is Douglas Freeman - and Gavin Hood's direction, particularly during the torture or terrorist activity scenes, is insipid and unoriginal.This is a movie made for previews: in a two-minute synopsis it looks an awful lot more impressive than it actually is. What is actually is, is a fairly bog-standard political message movie, and one that doesn't have the drama and entertainment of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" or the excellent characterisation of ""The Valley of Elah"". Whatever your political stance on the perception of terror, this isn't a film that will either make you think or force you to engage with its protagonists.Not recommended.",1,"Bland, badly-written.",1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,3289,"['Rendition', 'very', 'odd', 'movie', 'experience', 'got', 'cast', 'A-list', 'reliables', 'multi-award', 'winning', 'director', 'provocative', 'topic', 'central', 'plot', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'fantastic', 'thought-provoking', 'look', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'treatment', 'terrorism', 'instead', 'unfortunate', 'blend', 'three', 'insipid', 'storylines', 'tied', 'together', 'one', 'horrible', 'Pulp', 'Fiction-style', 'chronology', 'twists', ""n't"", 'manage', 'do', 'anything', 'interesting', 'say', 'anything', 'original.Egyptian-born', 'Anwar', 'El-Ibrahimi', 'Metwally', 'apprehended', 'C.I.A', 'return', 'United', 'States', 'CIA', 'bigwig', 'Corrine', 'Whitman', 'Streep', 'be', 'responsible', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'Africa', 'killed', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'official', 'lack', 'evidence', 'torturous', 'interrogation', 'country', 'attack', 'Meanwhile', 'back', 'U.S.', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Witherspoon', 'missing', 'persons', 'campaign', 'way', 'Washington', 'Northern', 'Africa', 'reluctant', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Douglas', 'Freeman', 'Gyllenhaal', 'best', 'assist', 'Anwar', 'plight.Performances', 'are', 'full', 'gusto', 'all-round', 'particularly', 'nice', 'see', 'Reece', 'Witherspoon', 'actually', 'acting', 'not', 'brilliantly', 'film', 'plot', ""n't"", 'centre', 'how', 'lovely-girls-attract-lovely-men', 'Metwally', 'Gyllenhaal', 'give', 'decent', 'turns', 'respective', 'captive/captor', 'roles', 'Zineb', 'Oukach', 'Yigal', 'Naor', 'are', 'good', 'Fatima', 'Abasi', 'even', 'strained', 'nature', 'daughter', 'vs.father', '/', 'left', 'vs.', 'right', 'relationship', 'left', 'largely', 'unexplored', 'Unfortunately', 'Streep', 'surprisingly', 'underused', 'what', 'performance', 'unconvincing', 'one-dimensional', 'Moa', 'Khouas', 'would-be', 'terrorist', 'operative', 'Khalid', 'childish', 'annoying', 'Rendition', 'appalling', 'script', 'badly-written', 'dialogue', 'splits', 'three', 'distinct', 'threads', 'bleeding-heart', 'pleading', 'Witherspoon', 'crusty', 'flintiness', 'Streep', 'officials', 'Why-did-you-do-it', 'repetitive', 'torture', 'Gyllenhaal', 'scenes', 'Metwally', 'foreign', 'language', 'dialogue', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'as', 'lukewarm', 'rest', 'film', 'not', 'English', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'thinking', 'more', 'impressive', 'actually', 'Unfortunately', 'wishy-washiness', 'script', 'blandness', 'three', 'plot', 'threads', 'none', 'resolved', 'kind', 'spirit', 'originality', 'manage', 'make', 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'events', ""'re"", 'describing.The', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'developed', 'well', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'go', 'sort', 'emotional', 'journey', 'Douglas', 'Freeman', 'Gavin', 'Hood', 'direction', 'particularly', 'torture', 'terrorist', 'activity', 'scenes', 'insipid', 'unoriginal.This', 'movie', 'made', 'previews', 'two-minute', 'synopsis', 'awful', 'lot', 'more', 'impressive', 'actually', 'What', 'actually', 'fairly', 'bog-standard', 'political', 'message', 'movie', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'drama', 'entertainment', 'Manchurian', 'Candidate', 'excellent', 'characterisation', 'Valley', 'Elah', 'political', 'stance', 'perception', 'terror', ""n't"", 'film', 'will', 'either', 'make', 'think', 'force', 'engage', 'protagonists.Not', 'recommended']",N/A
1120702,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000YQAMZI,Samuel McKewon,"[7, 17]","Rendition"" is comfort food for liberals, stacking the odds against the use of torture so significantly that, in its own arrogance, it probably makes a case for it. These kind of simpleminded rants are perfect fodder for a world of clever, contrary conservatives who love taking aim at artists who are Too Pure For This World.However you feel on the matter is irrelevant to director Gavin Hood and screenwriter Kelley Sane, who present the viewer with the plight of a handsome Arab-American man who's beaten, stretched and drowned within an inch of his life over phone calls that were clearly not from a terrorist. There's no doubt of this. Not in one scene, including the prisoner's hilarious ""confession.""So the movie isn't about the validity of torture against a known or likely terrorist, but the inhumanity of it against a guy whose relatives have bad taste in cell phone peddlers. It's an exercise in rage against ""the man,"" to the point where a senatorial aide (Peter Sarsgaard) is 86d out of the film for correctly suggesting the prisoner's angry, pregnant wife (Reese Witherspoon) contact a lawyer when he's exhausted his own resources. As an ally, the aide is quickly replaced by the senator's secretary, who advises the wife stand in a hallway and scream at a shadowy CIA operative (Meryl Streep). Streep's character coos back a lame threat in (of course) a worthless Southern accent. Later, Witherspoon, so enormous she can only waddle about, collapses in an airport terminal to the pangs of birth.Shameless much?How about a subplot in which the beautiful daughter of a (presumably) Egyptian torturer/interrogator (Yigal Naor) runs away from home and falls in with a terrorist sympathizer whose very brother was tortured to death, the pictures of which are found in a scrapbook the boy frequently holds close to his chest? These star-crossed lovers are absurdly fit into the larger story of a suicide bomber who blows himself up in a market square, triggering an investigation by CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal).Anwar El-Ibrihimi (Omar Metwally) is a chemical engineer coming back from a trip to South Africa. Upon arriving in Washington, he's hooded, handcuffed and whisked away to a room. The bomb's just exploded, and the guy claiming responsibility once owned a phone that was used to call Anwar. Anwar denies it, and is flown to North Africa for extraordinary rendition. That is, he is tortured for information he clearly does not have. He's electrocuted, punched, and subjected to water boarding. Whether you define these things as torture or not, the movie surely does, and, with Anwar's innocence not in question, the viewer has no choice to be sickened by the proceeding. What's worse - supporting the practice, or depicting it in such sensational, physical fashion while officially standing ""against"" it?""Rendition"" joins ""The Life of David Gale"" as one of those exercises so pathetic and obvious that only the proverbial ""Kool-Aid drinker"" - or someone who's not at all savvy about about movies - will find themselves suckered by the experience. No surprise that Gyllenhaal or Witherspoon are banging around in this tripe, but it is a minor surprise to see Arkin.

When he doesn't arrive home, Anwar's wife Isabella (Witherspoon) travels to Washington to ask friend Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard), aid to Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin), who in turn is tight with anti-terrorist head Corrine Whitman (Streep), for help. Meanwhile, rookie CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal), shaken from the bombing that killed his superior, observes Anwar's torture carried out by the tough interrogator and original bomb target Fawal (Igal Naor), whose mind is elsewhere as his daughter Fatima (Zineb Oukach) has been missing for a week. The term 'Rendition' is the kidnapping of terrorist suspects who are then flown into countries where torture is the norm, and Tsotsi director Gavin Hood tackles both sides of the argument. Blurring the lines between right and wrong was always going to be a tough one to pull off, but Hood, along with scriptwriter Kelley Sane, manage it while patiently crafting together the multi-narrative story that climaxes in a cracking twist ending. But for once, a film's success doesn't rely on the believability of the twist; Rendition was an engaging film regardless, and when that twist unexpectedly crops up it's the cherry, not the cake. It's hard to fault anything in Rendition: the story is believable, the characters are well-rounded and fleshed-out, it raises some thought-provoking questions and delivers a timely message.

Incredibly powerful performances and well-developed characters evoke sympathy for two hours, but wholehearted satisfaction mysteriously eludes the film.Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) is captured by the FBI and interrogated for suspected terrorist activities. When the initial investigation leads nowhere, he is shipped out of the US in a process called ""extraordinary rendition"" to be further questioned by considerably more brutal methods. Meanwhile, his wife Isabella (Reese Witherspoon) pleads with longtime friend Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard) to help locate her missing husband. In South Africa, where Anwar is being held, investigations of a bombing that killed a US agent leads Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal) to observe the inhuman treatment of terrorist prisoners, and to battle with the idea of sacrificing an innocent life in the remote chance that it will save others.Rendition examines the lengths people will go to seek justice. It also examines what forms of justice people seek, and the oftentimes detrimental effect it has on innocent bystanders. Douglas must weigh his own conscience against the horrific torturing of Anwar, who only possesses the possibility of information, and disobeying his superiors. Alan weighs his conscience against doing what he believes to be right, and the importance of his career. Almost everyone else in the film faces mental turmoil, including Alan Arkin as Senator Hawkins, who has much less sympathy for Isabella, and Meryl Streep as Corrine Whitman who chooses to ignore the suffering of others due to her paranoid decision-making.Rendition suffers from too many stories and a bizarre time shift that unexpectedly confuses the audience. Similar to 2006's Babel, Rendition includes too many characters and too many subplots. Douglas's storyline, involving an unnecessary love interest, is connected to Abasi Fawal, who oversees the violent torture of terrorist suspects. Isabella deals with the disappearance of her husband and tracking down those responsible, and Abasi's daughter Fatima runs away from home to protest her arranged marriage, falling into the arms of a Jihad terrorist who likewise has mixed feelings about his purpose and beliefs.The film's biggest highlight is the superb acting from nearly all of its major players. Witherspoon is exceptional as the devoted and tear-inducing mother who has the added sympathy factor of a troubled young child and a pregnancy. Gyllenhaal is interesting to watch, although a little static with his performance and Metwally does a great job of being tortured for two hours. Streep, Arkin and Sarsgaard actually turn in even more memorable performances due to their strong personalities and commanding presence. With a confusingly ill-placed time jump near the conclusion, and a disturbing story fused with phenomenal acting, Rendition hints at Academy Award worthy performances as well as that the CIA can learn a thing or two from Google.- Mike Massie",3,Rendition Movie Review,1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,3162,"['distressingly', 'realistic', 'film', 'horrors', 'terrorism', 'what', 'governments', 'do', 'get', 'roots', 'evil', 'Rendition', 'suffers', 'fact', 'reality', ""n't"", 'always', 'equal', 'entertainment', 'Incredibly', 'powerful', 'performances', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'evoke', 'sympathy', 'two', 'hours', 'wholehearted', 'satisfaction', 'mysteriously', 'film.Anwar', 'El-Ibrahimi', 'Omar', 'Metwally', 'captured', 'FBI', 'interrogated', 'suspected', 'terrorist', 'activities', 'When', 'initial', 'investigation', 'nowhere', 'shipped', 'US', 'process', 'called', 'extraordinary', 'rendition', 'be', 'further', 'questioned', 'considerably', 'more', 'brutal', 'methods', 'Meanwhile', 'wife', 'Isabella', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'longtime', 'friend', 'Alan', 'Smith', 'Peter', 'Sarsgaard', 'help', 'locate', 'missing', 'husband', 'South', 'Africa', 'where', 'Anwar', 'being', 'held', 'investigations', 'bombing', 'killed', 'US', 'agent', 'Douglas', 'Freeman', 'Jake', 'Gyllenhaal', 'observe', 'inhuman', 'treatment', 'terrorist', 'prisoners', 'battle', 'idea', 'sacrificing', 'innocent', 'life', 'remote', 'chance', 'will', 'save', 'others.Rendition', 'lengths', 'people', 'will', 'go', 'seek', 'justice', 'also', 'what', 'forms', 'justice', 'people', 'seek', 'oftentimes', 'detrimental', 'effect', 'innocent', 'bystanders', 'Douglas', 'must', 'weigh', 'own', 'conscience', 'horrific', 'torturing', 'Anwar', 'who', 'only', 'possibility', 'information', 'disobeying', 'superiors', 'Alan', 'conscience', 'doing', 'what', 'be', 'right', 'importance', 'career', 'Almost', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'mental', 'turmoil', 'including', 'Alan', 'Arkin', 'Senator', 'Hawkins', 'who', 'much', 'less', 'sympathy', 'Isabella', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Corrine', 'Whitman', 'who', 'ignore', 'suffering', 'others', 'due', 'paranoid', 'decision-making.Rendition', 'suffers', 'too', 'many', 'stories', 'bizarre', 'time', 'shift', 'unexpectedly', 'audience', 'Similar', '2006', 'Babel', 'Rendition', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'Douglas', 'storyline', 'involving', 'unnecessary', 'love', 'interest', 'connected', 'Abasi', 'Fawal', 'who', 'violent', 'torture', 'terrorist', 'suspects', 'Isabella', 'deals', 'disappearance', 'husband', 'tracking', 'down', 'responsible', 'Abasi', 'daughter', 'Fatima', 'away', 'home', 'protest', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'falling', 'arms', 'Jihad', 'terrorist', 'who', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'purpose', 'beliefs.The', 'film', 'biggest', 'highlight', 'superb', 'acting', 'nearly', 'major', 'players', 'Witherspoon', 'exceptional', 'devoted', 'tear-inducing', 'mother', 'who', 'added', 'sympathy', 'factor', 'troubled', 'young', 'child', 'pregnancy', 'Gyllenhaal', 'interesting', 'watch', 'little', 'static', 'performance', 'Metwally', 'great', 'job', 'being', 'tortured', 'two', 'hours', 'Streep', 'Arkin', 'Sarsgaard', 'actually', 'turn', 'even', 'more', 'memorable', 'performances', 'due', 'strong', 'personalities', 'commanding', 'presence', 'confusingly', 'ill-placed', 'time', 'jump', 'conclusion', 'disturbing', 'story', 'fused', 'phenomenal', 'acting', 'Rendition', 'hints', 'Academy', 'Award', 'worthy', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'CIA', 'can', 'learn', 'thing', 'two', 'Google.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A

In Washington, DC, CIA Director Corinne Whitman (Meryl Streep) orders her people to grab Anwar as he changes planes; they suspect he may have ties to a terrorist who bombed a crowded square in a northern African country. After a few moments of interrogation, Anwar is shipped to the North African country where he is interrogated and tortured by the chief of police, Abasi Fawal (Yigal Naor) on behalf of the CIA. A new CIA administrator, Douglas Freeman (Jake Gylenhaal) finds himself thrust into the role of interrogator when the interrogator is killed in the square bombing. There isn't time to find a replacement, so Douglas has to take over. When Isabella realizes her husband has vanished, she turns to an old school friend, Alan Smith (Peter Saarsgard) who works in the office of Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin) to see if he can help.""Rendition"", written by Kelly Sane and directed by Gavin Hood (Academy Award Winner ""Tsotsi""), wants to expose and dramatize a practice our country seems to be involved in, a practice we are learning more and more about. The film does cast a light on this murky area of our political engine, but it doesn't fully engage the audience in the characters and is weakened because of this. I don't think ""Rendition"" is powerful enough to get people to act.Meryl Streep is one of our greatest actresses and I would pay to watch her read the phone book. When I was describing this film to a co-worker, I brought up ""Out of Africa"" and the co-worker started to criticize Streep's performance as Issak Dinesen. I almost got into a fistfight when she made a comment about Streep's `fake accent'. Streep always makes any film she appears in better - good or bad, films benefit from the actresses ability to make a character come alive and her oft-noted ability to portray accents. Naturally, every performance is different and some work better than others. But they are all, at the very least, good. In ""Rendition"", she plays Whitman, the steely director of the CIA. She receives a call in the middle of the night; a bombing in a busy square in a North African country has killed one of their special interrogators. At the same time, they are tracking Anwar on his flight from South Africa. She instantly orders the suspect to be captured when he switches planes at Dulles. She wants him interrogated. When they can reach no conclusive answers and she is running out of time to hold him, she has him shipped back to the same North African country for interrogation. She is convinced she knows something.The scariest thing about Streep's character is her conviction she knows what she is doing is right. She never doubts it. For a minute. So when she is confronted by the man's wife, Isabella (Witherspoon), she calmly and coolly tells the young mother that she is sorry for the woman's trouble, but she knows nothing. She manages to almost convince us and we know differently.Her character also has more than a little depth. When the phone call wakes her up in the middle of the night, she calms her husband (Bob Gunton) much like a parent would a child. He dutifully appears at her side at a black tie event. These moments help to show Corrine has a personal life, making her more than simply a ""villain"".Reese Witherspoon is good as Isabella. Naturally distraught, she tries to find out the truth about her husband, while caring for their young son and their unborn child. She turns to a friend (Peter Saarsgard) who works in a Senator's office for help after she learns that her husband got on the flight in South Africa but somehow never got off the flight at Dulles Airport. She finds credit card charges he made on the plane and then turns to the Senator's aide for help. As doors are continuously slammed in her face, she becomes more and more worried and more and more desperate.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Douglas Freeman, a new recruit for the CIA. Hired on as an Administrator, he quickly adjusts to life in the North African country, his new post. But the death of the agent who will be their new interrogator affects him and he is even more shocked to learn he will be taking the deceased man's place. When Nawal takes over the interrogation of Anwar, Douglas must watch the excessive techniques, challenging his convictions. He soon forms an opinion of the man's guilt or innocence and decides to act. This role is interesting, but I'm not sure it achieves the intended result. I feel we are supposed to see the futility of the actions through Douglas' eyes - He certainly doesn't like what they are doing, but he takes a long time to act, making the character a bit unsuccessful.Gyllenhaal has a few nice moments with the character. When his colleague dies, it clearly affects him. He is covered with the man's blood and has to take care of some business before he can even remove the shirt. After he does, we see his hands shake a bit as he goes through shock.Peter Saarsgard is good as Alan Smith, the Senator's aide, but his character gives up too easy. He is very determined to help Isabella, and even has the Senator's (Alan Arkin) ear for a while, but when Whitman gets to the Senator, everything changes and Peter is warned to stay away. If he believes in Anwar's innocence, why doesn't he fight more? If he doesn't believe in Anwar's case, why does he fight at all? Due to his past relationship with Isabella?The biggest problem with ""Rendition"" deals with the narrative. As we flip back and forth between the various characters, we also follow the story of Nawal's headstrong teenaged daughter, Fatima. Nawal doesn't want her to see a new boyfriend, Khalid, so she runs away, to live with him. As Nawal continues to search for her, we see the interrogation of Anwar and also the story of Fatima and Khalid's growing love. As they become more involved, Khalid takes her to a student demonstration and introduces her to some of his friends, friends who would rather remain anonymous. Nawal continues to try to find her, but has little luck. This story dovetails into the rest of the narrative, with the help of a sloppy device, and doesn't seem to do anything other than detract from the rest of the story.We are supposed to see a parallel between Fatima and Khalid and the interrogation of Anwar, but beyond the obvious, there really isn't any.Because of the large handful of characters we follow through the course of the film, each is equivalent to a supporting character. Supporting characters have less time on screen, less time to make us believe in their character and less time to make us really care for their character. Because we don't feel a strong bond or connection to Isabella or Anwar, his torture doesn't have the impact on us it should.""Rendition"" is good, but it isn't the film that will move us to take action.",3,Loses Focus and Doesn't Move Us Enough to Prompt Action,1198195200,"12 21, 2007",2007,7204,"['Anwar', 'El-Ibrahimi', 'Omar', 'Metwally', 'business', 'conference', 'Johannesburg', 'cab',
