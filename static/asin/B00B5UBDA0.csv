I have been lucky enough to see Paul Anka perform live 13 times, and his performances, his connection with his fans never cease to amaze me. This concert, taped before a Swiss audience in 2011 is, once again (as if we needed any more) proof that Anka is timeless. His style, his grace, his ability to adapt is second to none. The sheer amount of songs he has written for countless singers through the past 50 years is staggering. If you are expecting to see some has been crooner belting out some ancient tunes, you are in for some surprise. Paul Anka is just as fresh at 70 years old as he was at 19. The music is fantastic, his voice superb, the band outstanding and the set somehow manages to encompass a good chunk of his career. Up to date, modern and very tight, Anka and his band rip through songs old and new with a certainty of a hit Broadway play. Van Halen's ""Jump"" cuts with the precision of the finest knife, Michael Jackson's ""This is It"" sails like the wind and the acoustic set will leave you speechless. Paul hits the stage is like a hurricane blowing into town, taking everything in it's path with him. The audio is crystal clear, and the video looks like film, smooth and colorfulwith moody atmosphere. This is one concert DVD not to miss, You will find yourself playing it over and over. Mr. Anka, you never cease to amaze me. Wait, I already said that! Well, it's worth repeating!",5,Bravo! Bravo!

The video quality of this bluray is excellent but the audio is TERRIBLE indeed as others have said as though recorded by a camcorder like those amateur you-tube videos. It seems the band is distant, far far away from the singer and NOT with him. Even though it has a surround track, it might as well be mono. The entire musical orchestra is congested in the center speaker and not much anywhere else. Really amateurish audio recording indeed which really angers me for such a high quality singer to be pinned to this recording.This is a performance I will unfortunately hear just once and not repeat, sadly for the terrible recording they made.PSOh, btw did I mention the audio was terrible and also w/o surround information???

1622427,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00B5UBDA0,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[4, 4]","For over 50 years Canadian Pauil Anka has been writing pop hits (for both himself and others) and performing. In the late 1960s (I saw him perform in a night club and remember what a tight and professional show he performed. He then became a Las Vegas staple.). Over the years he's honed his craft and, though, the hits aren't there for him anymore, he still puts on a great show and even had co-writer credit on Michael Jackson's last recording, ""This is it!"".This Bluray contains a fairly recent performance, recorded in Basel Switzerland in 2011 and contains virtually every hit song Anka recorded(among the 24 songs performed during the 85 minute concert. (You also get to hear the songs he wrote for others - ""She's A Lady"" for Tom Jones and ""It Doesn't Matter Any More""). There are a few that he didn't write (but never says he didn't. ""New York, New York"" is Kander/Ebb, for instance, and was a hit for Frank Sinatra (as was Anka's ""My Way""). Speaking of Sinatra, Anka has a lot of the stage presence of Sinatra during his night club years. He loves his audience and encourages them to sing along and he roams into the audience quite often. (The curtain call at end runs nearly 4 minutes before the ending credits roll.Anka still has the voice and he put together a good band to back him, with a large brass section. Og did I mention he does two songs on acoustic guitar? That's the first time I ever saw him play one.The image quality and sound are sharp. There are no bonus features. Anka fans (especially those who don't have other DVds of the singer, will enjoy this. I did.
