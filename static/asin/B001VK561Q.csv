1243717,A2O22ZVJ3BLH64,B001VK561Q,Jean Valjean,"[10, 10]","This is an excellent film which provides the viewer with an unique perspective of Deaf people and their culture during the years of the Great Depression (1930s).  This Hallmark film was also unique in having the key roles of Deaf individuals performed by prominent Deaf actors.  Those two actors, Phyllis Frelich and Edmund Waterstreet, gave performances which provided much insight into the challenges and difficulties that Deaf individuals had in dealing with hearing people in the world of work and outside during those hard times.The previous reviewer of this DVD mentioned that it was not captioned.  I am assuming that he was referring to the lack of english subtitles.  If that is the case, he is correct.  However, this DVD fortunately is closed captioned.  If any viewers turn on the decoder in their television sets, the captioning should be viewable.  Both the film and the ""Making of"" featurette are closed captioned.This DVD product is highly recommended for anyone with interest in learning about Deaf people.  This film is based on an excellent book which was published during the early 1970s called In This Sign by Joanne Greenberg.  I would recommend anyone who views this film to also read the book.",5,An Excellent Film about Deaf Culture ... available with Closed Captions!,1279756800,"07 22, 2010",2010,1217,"['excellent', 'film', 'viewer', 'unique', 'perspective', 'Deaf', 'people', 'culture', 'years', 'Great', 'Depression', '1930s', 'Hallmark', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'unique', 'having', 'key', 'roles', 'Deaf', 'individuals', 'performed', 'prominent', 'Deaf', 'actors', 'two', 'actors', 'Phyllis', 'Frelich', 'Edmund', 'Waterstreet', 'gave', 'performances', 'provided', 'much', 'insight', 'challenges', 'difficulties', 'Deaf', 'individuals', 'had', 'dealing', 'hearing', 'people', 'world', 'work', 'outside', 'hard', 'times.The', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'DVD', 'mentioned', 'was', 'not', 'captioned', 'am', 'assuming', 'was', 'referring', 'lack', 'english', 'subtitles', 'case', 'correct', 'However', 'DVD', 'fortunately', 'closed', 'captioned', 'viewers', 'turn', 'decoder', 'television', 'sets', 'captioning', 'should', 'be', 'viewable', 'film', 'Making', 'featurette', 'are', 'closed', 'captioned.This', 'DVD', 'product', 'highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'interest', 'learning', 'Deaf', 'people', 'film', 'based', 'excellent', 'book', 'was', 'published', 'early', '1970s', 'called', 'Sign', 'Joanne', 'Greenberg', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'film', 'also', 'read', 'book']",Love Is Never Silent

This shows where they can't sign in public and not sure if they were ashamed or it wasn't allowed in public so they live in shelter lives. I can relate to that.,5,Great!,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",2013,309,"['must', 'watch', 'am', 'deaf', 'CC', 'lot', 'signing', '2', 'deaf', 'parents', 'children', 'depression', 'time', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sign', 'public', 'not', 'sure', 'were', 'ashamed', 'was', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'public', 'live', 'shelter', 'lives', 'can', 'relate']",Love Is Never Silent

It tugs at your heart and really opens your eyes to how difficult life can be for those who cannot hear.Mare Winningham plays a girl who is the ears and voice for her family.  Her brother dying in an awful accident early on in her life leaves her as their only link to the hearing world.  When she comes of age, she must deal with the struggle to balance the responsibility she feels for her parents and the desires of her own heart.I remembered this movie from 25 years ago and was thrilled to find a copy in DVD.  A family movie that can open up great conversation regarding those we view as handicapped and how we can understand their dilemmas and be open to making their lives a little easier.Adults, teens, tweens ... a movie I recommend for all.",5,"Heartfelt, joyful, tear-jerker ...",1280707200,"08 2, 2010",2010,880,"['movie', 'very', 'realistically', 'family', 'life', 'hearing', 'child', 'two', 'deaf', 'parents', 'played', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'deaf', 'heart', 'really', 'eyes', 'how', 'difficult', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'hear.Mare', 'Winningham', 'girl', 'who', 'ears', 'voice', 'family', 'brother', 'dying', 'awful', 'accident', 'early', 'life', 'only', 'link', 'hearing', 'world', 'When', 'age', 'must', 'deal', 'struggle', 'balance', 'responsibility', 'parents', 'desires', 'own', 'heart.I', 'remembered', 'movie', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'thrilled', 'find', 'copy', 'DVD', 'A', 'family', 'movie', 'can', 'open', 'up', 'great', 'conversation', 'regarding', 'view', 'handicapped', 'how', 'can', 'understand', 'dilemmas', 'be', 'open', 'making', 'lives', 'little', 'easier.Adults', 'teens', 'tweens', 'movie', 'recommend']",Love Is Never Silent
