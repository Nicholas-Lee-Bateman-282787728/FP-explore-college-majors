And Apostle Peter & The Last Supperis one of those few.** Spoiler Alert **This movie focuses on the last days of the Apostle Peter in while prison. It uses conversations with his jailer and his flashbacks to tell the stories of Jesus with emphasis on the Last Supper.This is an excellent way to see the many parts of the Bible presented using period costumes and suitable sets.This is a great way to share Bible stories with children or others for the first time. Plus the lives like interactions bring a fresh perspective for those familiar with the Scriptures.Many Bible verses are used in conversations in ways that are natural.There is emphasis on the hope of heaven after death.

You see his shame for denying Christ. You see his heart for others right up to the point of execution. And you feel the confusion in the guards mind. You can hear him asking himself &#34;How or why would God care for and love me? This could almost be considered an autobiography of Peter's last week .
