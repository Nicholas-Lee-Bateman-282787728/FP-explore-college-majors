The characters are generally well cast, the dialogue is fitting, and the relations between characters is well developed.  I don't know if all the scenes are historically accurate, but I know that a great deal of it is... especially the names of the athletes, the results of the events and the Olympic Stadium in Greece.  Although centered around the American team and its athletes, there is considerable attention paid to the lives of athletes from other countries, most notably Greece and Australia.  Unfortunately a couple of the athletes portrayed could have been played by actors who were more appropriate for the events they were in, and you'll pick them out right away.This is a FAMILY MOVIE, no sex, no vulgar language, nothing that shouldn't be seen by anyone in your family.

312241,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6302428084,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[26, 29]","""The First Olympics - Athens 1896"" tells a story that is a far cry from the spectacle the world witnessed tonight in Salt Lake City.  In an effort to promote peace, the Baron Pierre de Courbertin (Louis Jordan) wants to revive the Olympic movement.  Athletes from around the world will gather in Athens in 1896 and the Baron thinks it is important that the United States field a team.  David Ogden Stiers plays William Sloane, a professor of classic studies who agrees to put together the American team.  If the stories told in this charming slice of history are not true, please do not tell me.  For me the focal character is young Robert Garrett (Hunt Block), who kisses his mother (Angela Landsbury) goodbye and goes off to compete for honor and glory.  But neither Robert or the good professor know anything about the sports in the Olympics beyond what they can learn from reading Homer and looking at pictures of Greek urns while the maid has to show the boys how to run the high hurdles.  This results in an awkward moment at a fundraiser where the team concludes they are suppose to compete in the nude like the ancient Greeks.  The American team receives no governmental support and the Ivy League schools are against in; their uniforms are white with stripes representing their college colors.  The first part ends with the Professor left behind as the team sails off to Europe, at which point he learns that the Greeks follow a different calendar and the team will not get there until the final day of competition.  That means the second part starts with a mad dash across the continent to arrive in Athens in time.While the mini-series does focus on the American team, we also follow several other notable participants in that first modern Olympics, including the legendary Greek marathoner, Spiridon Loues (Nicos Ziagos).  There is a cute moment when the Greek orchestra leader has to pick between two songs to represent the Americans at the awards ceremony but my favorite part is when Robert Garrett learns that he will not be allowed to compete with the shot put and discuss he has been practicing with all these many months.  You see they are not regulation size.  In fact, they are about twice as big as they are supposed to be.  Seems those Greek urns need to be updated.  The scene where he is given the shot put he must use, instead of his cannon ball, and he tosses it up into the air a couple of times.  There is also a very touching moment when back in America Professor Sloane receives the telegram that announces the first Olympic Gold medal in almost two thousands years has been won by an American.  Stiers is wonderful in this role as are the cast of unknown young actors (only David Caruso as a cocky Irish long jumper from Bah-ston is recognizable).  ""The First Olympics--Athens 1896"" is one of those mini-series that should be shown every four years, right before the summer Olympics.  If you have seen it, then you have never forgotten it, and everyone who enjoys watching the world's best athletes compete before the entire world should get to see this mini-series at least once as well.",5,"The ""true"" story of the first modern American Olympic team",1013126400,"02 8, 2002",2002,3120,"['First', 'Olympics', 'Athens', '1896', 'story', 'far', 'cry', 'spectacle', 'world', 'witnessed', 'tonight', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'City', 'effort', 'promote', 'peace', 'Baron', 'Pierre', 'de', 'Courbertin', 'Louis', 'Jordan', 'revive', 'Olympic', 'movement', 'Athletes', 'world', 'will', 'gather', 'Athens', '1896', 'Baron', 'important', 'United', 'States', 'field', 'team', 'David', 'Ogden', 'Stiers', 'William', 'Sloane', 'professor', 'classic', 'studies', 'who', 'put', 'together', 'American', 'team', 'stories', 'told', 'charming', 'slice', 'history', 'are', 'not', 'true', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'tell', 'focal', 'character', 'young', 'Robert', 'Garrett', 'Hunt', 'Block', 'who', 'mother', 'Angela', 'Landsbury', 'goodbye', 'off', 'compete', 'honor', 'glory', 'Robert', 'good', 'professor', 'know', 'anything', 'sports', 'Olympics', 'what', 'can', 'learn', 'reading', 'Homer', 'looking', 'pictures', 'Greek', 'urns', 'maid', 'show', 'boys', 'how', 'run', 'high', 'hurdles', 'results', 'awkward', 'moment', 'fundraiser', 'where', 'team', 'are', 'suppose', 'compete', 'nude', 'ancient', 'Greeks', 'American', 'team', 'governmental', 'support', 'Ivy', 'League', 'schools', 'are', 'uniforms', 'are', 'white', 'stripes', 'representing', 'college', 'colors', 'first', 'part', 'Professor', 'left', 'behind', 'team', 'Europe', 'point', 'Greeks', 'follow', 'different', 'calendar', 'team', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'there', 'final', 'day', 'competition', 'second', 'part', 'mad', 'dash', 'continent', 'arrive', 'Athens', 'mini-series', 'focus', 'American', 'team', 'also', 'follow', 'several', 'other', 'notable', 'participants', 'first', 'modern', 'Olympics', 'including', 'legendary', 'Greek', 'marathoner', 'Spiridon', 'Loues', 'Nicos', 'Ziagos', 'cute', 'moment', 'when', 'Greek', 'orchestra', 'leader', 'pick', 'two', 'songs', 'represent', 'Americans', 'awards', 'ceremony', 'favorite', 'part', 'when', 'Robert', 'Garrett', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'compete', 'shot', 'put', 'discuss', 'been', 'practicing', 'many', 'months', 'see', 'are', 'not', 'regulation', 'size', 'fact', 'are', 'about', 'twice', 'as', 'big', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'Seems', 'Greek', 'urns', 'need', 'be', 'updated', 'scene', 'where', 'given', 'shot', 'put', 'must', 'use', 'instead', 'cannon', 'ball', 'up', 'air', 'couple', 'times', 'also', 'very', 'touching', 'moment', 'when', 'back', 'America', 'Professor', 'Sloane', 'telegram', 'first', 'Olympic', 'Gold', 'medal', 'almost', 'two', 'thousands', 'years', 'been', 'won', 'American', 'Stiers', 'wonderful', 'role', 'are', 'cast', 'unknown', 'young', 'actors', 'only', 'David', 'Caruso', 'cocky', 'Irish', 'long', 'jumper', 'Bah-ston', 'recognizable', 'First', 'Olympics', '1896', 'one', 'mini-series', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'four', 'years', 'right', 'summer', 'Olympics', 'have', 'seen', 'then', 'have', 'never', 'forgotten', 'everyone', 'who', 'watching', 'world', 'best', 'athletes', 'compete', 'entire', 'world', 'should', 'get', 'see', 'mini-series', 'least', 'once', 'as', 'well']",The First Olympics - Athens 1896 - 2 Volume set VHS
312242,A36614H8BSX4B1,6302428084,Lee the reader,"[2, 2]","Wish they took the lesson to heart a little more!  I love BBC shows from the eighties, and this was a rare try for a more elegantly scripted, character driven series on OUR side of the pond.  It's not perfect, but it's probably my favorite 80's miniseries.  I have seen it many times.  I finally broke down and updated this on DVD from the VHS.  It is an excellent show!  Today some would consider it dated - I love it because unlike today's sensationalistic, sexual productions, it manages to convey the spirit of the first modern olympics.  The goal in this Victorian time was to seek after the ideal of excellence in mind, spirit and body, instead of a rush to heady individual glory.  That effort is brought to the fore ably through the character portrayed by David Ogden Stiers.Stiers is just superb as the professor who felt that sport belonged at university as an additional honing of the individual.  He viewed it as a necessary compliment to simply educating the mind, despite many on the faculty who didn't want the added distraction.  His character works the entire series to convey the thought that the academic individual needs to grow as a whole being, not just as an intellectual.  For him, the Olympic ideal is simply part of the pursuit of personal greatness as part of a balanced whole.  It is a touchstone to the great wellspring of ancient Greek idealism and thought.  He imparts that fire to the students, and by following the individual athletes you are struck by their dedication to the these ideals.  Instead of simply beating the other competitors, they seek greatness in their souls - yet it is fun to see them win, too.  And we do get the pleasure of seeing the Greeks find their fulfillment also.There are a couple of bits of silliness and PC.  I won't name them for spoilers, but you'll know them when you see them.  You'll roll your eyes a little, but it's all in good fun.  It's still all elevated by the inspiring speeches of the Professor.  I had never heard the actual story of Marathon before he told it, and it's something everyone should know.  When he gets up from his bed in the middle of the night, and says to his wife, ""Just think, for the first time in thousands of years, it is beginning again!""- it is a wonderful moment.  The writers really did try to convey something special, something unusual among the usually arcane and plebian TV fare.If you can watch stuff from pre CGI without snorting in derision, and British style miniseries are your thing, you should like this very much.  If you like history for what it inspires us to do, you should love it.  I'm sure a lot of the historical stuff isn't accurate, but there are some good solid moments that are true.

312246,A14RAY8IJOQY7L,6302428084,Mike Suchcicki,"[2, 2]","For years my wife and I watched our scratchy VHS copy that was recorded from the original airing of FO; it's one of our favorite miniseries ever (although we tend to consider it a long movie, rather than a miniseries). We were thrilled when it was finally released on DVD.If this is to be your first viewing of FO, be assured that this is a splendid dramatization of the events surrounding the First Modern Olympics and, particularly, America's participation in the games (although other countries are represented in the proceedings). It's impressive in scope in some places, but in others its made-for-TV budgetary origins are apparent. If made today, with this same approach and screenplay, it would not be inappropriate on the Hallmark Channel. All of the performances are wonderful, and the necessary expository scenes, particularly those at the beginning of Part 2, are not overly cumbersome. There's also significant comic relief, particularly from the Americans' ignorance of the proper dimensions of certain track-and-field apparatus (not to mention proper athletic garb), and the USA's seeming lack of a national anthem (although some historical liberties are taken here).The DVD transfer is clean and crisp and about as good as can be expected when transferring from a film that did not enjoy the greatest cinematography to begin with. That I did not award this DVD five stars was only because of the dearth of extras.By the way, the cover image is simply a promotional shot; it has nothing to do with the miniseries; in the 1896 Olympics, athletes had yet to take up the practice of draping themselves in their flag as they took a victory lap.",4,Great DVD presentation of a wonderful miniseries,1220140800,"08 31, 2008",2008,1654,"['years', 'wife', 'watched', 'scratchy', 'VHS', 'copy', 'was', 'recorded', 'original', 'airing', 'FO', 'one', 'favorite', 'miniseries', 'ever', 'tend', 'consider', 'long', 'movie', 'rather', 'miniseries', 'were', 'thrilled', 'when', 'was', 'finally', 'released', 'DVD.If', 'be', 'first', 'viewing', 'FO', 'be', 'assured', 'splendid', 'dramatization', 'events', 'surrounding', 'First', 'Modern', 'Olympics', 'particularly', 'America', 'participation', 'games', 'other', 'countries', 'are', 'represented', 'proceedings', 'impressive', 'scope', 'places', 'others', 'made-for-TV', 'budgetary', 'origins', 'are', 'apparent', 'made', 'today', 'same', 'approach', 'screenplay', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'inappropriate', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'performances', 'are', 'wonderful', 'necessary', 'expository', 'scenes', 'particularly', 'beginning', 'Part', '2', 'are', 'not', 'overly', 'cumbersome', 'also', 'significant', 'comic', 'relief', 'particularly', 'Americans', 'ignorance', 'proper', 'dimensions', 'certain', 'track-and-field', 'apparatus', 'not', 'mention', 'proper', 'athletic', 'garb', 'USA', 'seeming', 'lack', 'national', 'anthem', 'historical', 'liberties', 'are', 'taken', 'here', '.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'clean', 'crisp', 'as', 'good', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'when', 'transferring', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'greatest', 'cinematography', 'begin', 'did', 'not', 'award', 'DVD', 'five', 'stars', 'was', 'only', 'dearth', 'extras.By', 'way', 'cover', 'image', 'simply', 'promotional', 'shot', 'nothing', 'do', 'miniseries', '1896', 'Olympics', 'athletes', 'had', 'yet', 'take', 'up', 'practice', 'draping', 'flag', 'took', 'victory', 'lap']",The First Olympics - Athens 1896 - 2 Volume set VHS

312251,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,6302428084,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[0, 0]","Pay no attention to the nearly-bald Marine on the cover of the DVD. This made-for-TV-two-parter has NOTHING to do with that sort of thing (I nominate this DVD for most-misleading box art of all-time).When I was a little kid, I saw this one on TV. Naturally since I was so young a lot of details were hazy. What did I remember? I remembered that the U.S. Olympic Team had scheduled their voyager wrong because of a calendar date and were in danger of missing the Olympics almost entirely. I remember the swimmer jumping into the water and coming back out because the water was ice cold. I remember one of the team running to catch up to the departing train, the marathon runners being giving alcoholic drinks on their run, and an exhausted runner struggling to keep going while his friend rode next to him on a bicycle to encourage him through the race. Oh yes, I remembered all that despite having seen it only once when I was around 5 years old. Because that sort of thing sticks with you forever when you see it as a kid.Fast forward almost 25 years, and I could not remember the name of the film to save my life. I searched everywhere for it, checking out every film about the early Olympics I could find. I watched Chariots of Fire just to see if that was the movie I was looking for! I had all but given up hope when I was walking through the isle-way of a store and saw this DVD. The year was right, the description looked right. Might this be the film I was looking for? I asked the store associate if I could return it if it was not the film I thought it was. They said no. I bought it anyway. Because I had know.Oh yesYes. This is the film I remembered all right. Now, it's a bit of a cheesy film, being made-for-TV in the 80's after all. The first half of the picture is a cute Disney-ish production that quickly sets up some like-able characters and their noble quest to go to the first Olympics. There's definitely some memorable charm to be had there, from the athletes going out naked because they known that's what the ancient Greeks did, to making their own discus and shot-put off of images of Greek pottery, to the young Greek man who becomes selected for the marathon due to his nightly epic runs to see his girlfriend at her village. All this is well-acted, and entertaining (and very charming).And then...you watch the second halfOh man! This film goes from 2 or 3 stars to 5 just from a few key scenes in the second half. Everything just becomes so much more entertaining, as an athlete is forced to use a discus and shot-put half the size he trained with, two marksmen brothers come up with a way to increase the speed of the runners at the gun, and an injured runner tries to overcome his broken body to win Olympic medals.To make everything even more epic, the camera angles, and overall cinematography seems to make a huge jump from mediocre to epic film quality, and all the athletic events are very exciting. Naturally there is a happy ending and some family heart-warming to close the film with etc, etc. True classic family entertainment.The Olympic SpiritWhenever I watch this movie now I can't escape the feeling that someone desperately needs to remake it with modern actors and a big budget. They don't really need to change much, just give us some more close-ups, good camera-work etc, and flesh out the characters even a bit more. I'd go to see it in a theater, that for sure. Heck, I'd even see this version if someone brought it to a theater.As it stands, this is one of the best made-for-TV films I've ever seen. Very much worth a purchase, even with the mediocre picture and sound quality. And as to the authenticity of the film...read the Wikipedia article if you want to know what really happened. I for one have ZERO complaints with this film. It's entertaining, idealistic, inspiring, and family friendly.
