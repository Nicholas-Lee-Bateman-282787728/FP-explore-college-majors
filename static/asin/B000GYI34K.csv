1008267,A3C9UDU6XQQ70Q,B000GYI34K,Canuck in WA,"[1, 2]","Being a lifelong Baltimore Colts fan, when this DVD first came out, I viewed it with both curiosity and disdain.  I'm an avid collector of NFL films material, so my initial thought was that this was just going to be a recycled collection of snippets and short summaries that had appeared on other NFL compilations (Such as ""Gift of Grab"" or ""The Quarterbacks""), and that this was going to be a waste of money.  However, when the price of the video in the new section had dropped down to below $2.00, I thought ""why not.""  Surprisingly, I was pleased that I made the purchase, as a great deal of material going over the Colts history, I had not seen before.  Typically, the DVD goes into the formation of the Colts in 1948 (was surprised that they started with the AAFC material, as I thought that this might be overlooked and that it would start only with the year after the ""Dallas Texans"" debacle . .so give NFL films credit for adding this in) all the way until that day that I would like to forget (3-28-84).  The late 50's and 60's are given generous coverage, and the last real vestige of great Colt teams in the mid-70's is also given their just due.  The extra content is what really makes this DVD however.  Yes, there were recycled pieces of Jimmy Orr, Big Daddy Lipscomb and John Mackey from previous NFL VHS's & DVD's, but the updated content of Raymond Berry, Memorial Stadium and the '67 Colts were a welcome sight.  And the extensive coverage of the '58 Championship Game was a great bonus.  It covered the entire game, and though not every play, it was thorough enough to get an idea of what the game was truly like, and the turning points which impacted the overall result as well. Could there have been a bit more added?  Yes, of course.  Personally, I would've liked to seen Art Donovan play a much more prominent role in the DVD, as his stories are engaging and truly a work of art.  But again, that is my own opinion, and from an overall objectivity standpoint, the Baltimore history of the Colts is well done.All in all, I was pleased that I made the purchase.  It rekindled alot of great memories, and if you happen to be a Colts fan as I was growing up, I think you would enjoy this DVD as well.In conclusion, I did not rate the ""Indianapolis"" history part of the set (which is Disc #2).  For me, doing so would be entirely biased on my part (slanted WAY towards the negative), so read other reviews to get a better understanding of what this might contain.",5,"Rating only the ""Baltimore"" part.",1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,2481,"['Being', 'lifelong', 'Baltimore', 'Colts', 'fan', 'when', 'DVD', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'viewed', 'curiosity', 'disdain', ""'m"", 'avid', 'collector', 'NFL', 'films', 'material', 'initial', 'thought', 'was', 'was', 'just', 'going', 'be', 'recycled', 'collection', 'snippets', 'short', 'summaries', 'had', 'appeared', 'other', 'NFL', 'compilations', 'Such', 'Gift', 'Grab', 'Quarterbacks', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'waste', 'money', 'However', 'when', 'price', 'video', 'new', 'section', 'had', 'dropped', 'down', 'below', '2.00', 'thought', 'why', 'not', 'Surprisingly', 'was', 'pleased', 'made', 'purchase', 'great', 'deal', 'material', 'going', 'Colts', 'history', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'before', 'Typically', 'DVD', 'formation', 'Colts', '1948', 'was', 'surprised', 'started', 'AAFC', 'material', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'overlooked', 'would', 'start', 'only', 'year', 'Dallas', 'Texans', 'debacle', 'give', 'NFL', 'films', 'credit', 'adding', 'way', 'day', 'would', 'like', 'forget', '3-28-84', 'late', '50', '60', 'are', 'given', 'generous', 'coverage', 'last', 'real', 'vestige', 'great', 'Colt', 'teams', 'mid-70', 'also', 'given', 'just', 'due', 'extra', 'content', 'what', 'really', 'DVD', 'however', 'Yes', 'were', 'recycled', 'pieces', 'Jimmy', 'Orr', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Lipscomb', 'John', 'Mackey', 'previous', 'NFL', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'updated', 'content', 'Raymond', 'Berry', 'Memorial', 'Stadium', ""'67"", 'Colts', 'were', 'welcome', 'sight', 'extensive', 'coverage', ""'58"", 'Championship', 'Game', 'was', 'great', 'bonus', 'covered', 'entire', 'game', 'not', 'play', 'was', 'thorough', 'enough', 'get', 'idea', 'what', 'game', 'was', 'truly', 'like', 'turning', 'points', 'impacted', 'overall', 'result', 'as', 'well', 'Could', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'added', 'Yes', 'course', 'Personally', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'seen', 'Art', 'Donovan', 'play', 'much', 'more', 'prominent', 'role', 'DVD', 'stories', 'are', 'engaging', 'truly', 'work', 'art', 'again', 'own', 'opinion', 'overall', 'objectivity', 'standpoint', 'Baltimore', 'history', 'Colts', 'well', 'done.All', 'was', 'pleased', 'made', 'purchase', 'rekindled', 'alot', 'great', 'memories', 'happen', 'be', 'Colts', 'fan', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'think', 'would', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'well.In', 'conclusion', 'did', 'not', 'rate', 'Indianapolis', 'history', 'part', 'set', 'Disc', '2', 'doing', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'entirely', 'biased', 'part', 'slanted', 'WAY', 'negative', 'so', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'get', 'better', 'understanding', 'what', 'might', 'contain']",Colts: The Complete History

The 1958 game, the 1995 season led by Jim ""Comeback Kid"" Harbaugh, and so much more span both of these discs.  For a Colts fan it is a must have, but even for a fan of the NFL one will find a lot of great footage, and a lot of stories that bring back memories of past games no matter what your age is.  The only downer to this set is that it was produced right before they won the Superbowl, so it is kind of bittersweet in the final few minutes of the 2nd disc how they speak of ""trying to get back there"" when in fact, they were just months away from reaching that very pinnacle.

Instead of a feature on Harbaugh, we get Jim Mora? He's more a Saints guy. I'm also wondering why they didn't cover WHY the Colts moved to Indy. At least one sentence or two.

1008273,AFSFRSVWGQZC6,B000GYI34K,Surefire,"[0, 0]","Let me start by saying that I've been a Colts fan since the 1960's when I first became aware of pro football. I'll also add another interesting point. I'm from Indiana. Yep, that's right, and I was a huge Colts / Johnny U fan, and still am for that matter. Now, I think you know where this is headed. I thoroughly enjoyed the Baltimore Colts history. I love the perspective of the players from those great Colts teams. So I recommend this package for that disc alone, if you don't care for the Indy teams.But, as offensive as this will sound to some old Baltimore Colts fans, I'm going to say it anyway. I also enjoyed the history of the Indianapolis Colts, and would also recommend this package based on that disc too. I still love the Colts and the Peyton Manning era. Those Colts teams also accomplished some great things. I'm also pleased that the Colts picked up Andrew Luck and look forward to amazing things from him.So the bottom line is this: While I enjoyed the history of the Baltimore Colts more, I still recommend this package for the Baltimore, as well as the Indianapolis Colts. Get the package, sit back and enjoy it. You'll love the history of these two eras of Colts history.
