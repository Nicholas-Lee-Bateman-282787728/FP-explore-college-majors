It has profanity, sexual innuendos, and while it is set in a church, it is not a church based movie. As it says in the rating of PG 13, it is rated that way for Language, Sex, and Drug references.I would define this movie in two ways:First, it is a movie about community and a willingness to work towards a common goal.Second, it is a movie about the past and about misunderstandings.I enjoyed the movie because of the second theme, but I only give it a limited endorsement because of the content.",3,Limited audience,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,566,"['NOT', 'family', 'movie', 'family', 'age', '18', 'profanity', 'sexual', 'innuendos', 'set', 'church', 'not', 'church', 'based', 'movie', 'rating', 'PG', '13', 'rated', 'way', 'Language', 'Sex', 'Drug', 'references.I', 'would', 'define', 'movie', 'two', 'ways', 'First', 'movie', 'community', 'willingness', 'work', 'towards', 'common', 'goal.Second', 'movie', 'past', 'misunderstandings.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'second', 'theme', 'only', 'give', 'limited', 'endorsement', 'content']",Preaching To The Choir

981280,A2FTFUIGAFL63Z,B000F1IO16,"F. Bailey ""NYC Black Christian""","[5, 7]","This movie doesn't know whether it wants to be a Christian movie or secular movie.  From just looking at the cover, I thought I was getting a nice Christian movie, but the amount of profanity and sexual innuendo made it clear to me that I was mistaken.  That having been said, the movie was still pretty good.  I don't see how a movie like this can make any money though.  The Christian theme would offend the sinners and the cursing and sex talk would offend the Christians - especially the deep ones.  If this movie is trying to pass as a Christian movie, it failed the test.  It does have a happy ending but the movie has no real redeeming value.  It doesn't attempt to present the Gospel message in any way shape or form.  If you're looking for a pure Christian movie, maybe you should skip this one, but if you want to be entertained and don't mind a few curse words here and there, this would be a pretty good one to watch.",3,"Not exactly a Christian movie, but still pretty good.",1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,929,"['movie', ""n't"", 'know', 'be', 'Christian', 'movie', 'secular', 'movie', 'just', 'looking', 'cover', 'thought', 'was', 'getting', 'nice', 'Christian', 'movie', 'amount', 'profanity', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'made', 'clear', 'was', 'mistaken', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'can', 'make', 'money', 'Christian', 'theme', 'would', 'offend', 'sinners', 'cursing', 'sex', 'talk', 'would', 'offend', 'Christians', 'especially', 'deep', 'ones', 'movie', 'trying', 'pass', 'Christian', 'movie', 'failed', 'test', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'movie', 'real', 'redeeming', 'value', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'present', 'Gospel', 'message', 'way', 'shape', 'form', ""'re"", 'looking', 'pure', 'Christian', 'movie', 'maybe', 'should', 'skip', 'one', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'few', 'curse', 'words', 'here', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'one', 'watch']",Preaching To The Choir
981281,A3L5NHE84NCRCX,B000F1IO16,Geni Ward,"[4, 8]","This movie shows how different sibblings are even if they are twin boys! Teshawn sneaked off and saw their father shot and killed by the husband of the woman he was cheating on his wife with.  Shortly after, his mother died of a broken heart.  Their aunt comes to their mothers' funeral and take them back to Harlen.Wesley did everything he felt was right and desires to be a minister; but Teshawn took a different path.  Teshawn began to not care about anything. Each brother took a different path in life. Wes (Darien Sills-Evans) became a minister in the Harlem gospel church their aunt took them to; while Te (Billoah Greene) perpetrates the gangster lifestyle he raps about as a Hip Hop star -- Zulu.Wes denies that he knows Zulu to local kids who look up to him, but they are forced into reconciliation when Te flees from La La Land to his childhood home in Harlem to hide from his enraged record producer Bull Sharky played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Wes does not welcome Te home but his fiance, aunt and all of the church people do!  Te takes over the choir and all of the local kids join the choir.  Te decides to enter the choir in a local contest that they always won when he was at home.  They lose the contest, but decide to make a gospel record.Bull Sharky catches up to Te and his friend who helped him steal his record masters back, they want to hurt him, but he conveniences them that he is going legit and makes a gospel record to make the producer more money.Te and Wes must face a harsh reality, we are different but the same.

The only thing that was remotely similar was the remote references to Gospel music and the storyline.The movie had potential but the language made it almost unwatchable.  By positioning it as a story similar to ""The Gospel"" the same sort of crowd was attracted--church people--and the profanity was a definite turnoff.  The funny thing is that the profanity did not advance the story, it felt thrown in.Also, the movie did not know if it wanted to be a comedy or a drama or both, the comedic edges were uneven but the tension in the drama was done pretty well.",3,Cursing at the choir,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,655,"['purchased', 'movie', 'thinking', 'going', 'be', 'similar', 'recent', 'film', 'Gospel', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'remotely', 'similar', 'was', 'remote', 'references', 'Gospel', 'music', 'storyline.The', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'language', 'made', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'positioning', 'story', 'similar', 'Gospel', 'same', 'sort', 'crowd', 'was', 'attracted', 'church', 'people', 'profanity', 'was', 'definite', 'turnoff', 'funny', 'thing', 'profanity', 'did', 'not', 'advance', 'story', 'felt', 'thrown', 'in.Also', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'wanted', 'be', 'comedy', 'drama', 'comedic', 'edges', 'were', 'uneven', 'tension', 'drama', 'was', 'done', 'pretty', 'well']",Preaching To The Choir

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[1, 2]","I can't remember laughing at one line in this movie, and it was in the comedy section of a rental store I went to. It sounded like an interesting plot about a wannabe gangster who, after fleeing from Los Angeles due to money and record disputes, comes back to his Harlem hometown to hide out.  The more he's around the church that he grew up in, the more he remembers how much he liked that lifestyle.Cons: The ending was SO unrealistic. There's no way in the world that a certain person would've gotten off that easy and been able to put out a certain product without paying (literally and figuratively) for it first. Even putting the man on stage with him would have made no difference to real criminals. I watched that part thinking ""C'mon now."" Even in a comedy, this was a stretch.  The church gossips I could see, but church gossips also tend to be paranoid, so those two blabbermouths leading a certain car to a certain destination was like the tooth fairy sitting next to me at work.  There were quite a few extra characters that had nothing to do with nothing, but showed up out of nowhere to sing.Pros: Speaking of singing, if I have to rate the movie on singing, it would get a 3.75 rating. The singing was pretty cool, but the musicians were phenomenal. That guy playing the horn at the end gets 5 stars all the way.  I loved him!  I rewound to hear him play again.  Also, I don't know the personal history of Billoah Greene and Janine Green's characters, but they made one awfully cute couple onscreen. (And both names are already Green minus one e...hint, hint!) I hope they gave that a chance when the cameras weren't on them.",2,To be honest with you...,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,1641,"['ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'laughing', 'one', 'line', 'movie', 'was', 'comedy', 'section', 'rental', 'store', 'went', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'plot', 'wannabe', 'gangster', 'who', 'fleeing', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'due', 'money', 'record', 'disputes', 'back', 'Harlem', 'hometown', 'hide', 'out', 'more', 'church', 'grew', 'up', 'more', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'lifestyle.Cons', 'ending', 'was', 'SO', 'unrealistic', 'way', 'world', 'certain', 'person', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'off', 'easy', 'been', 'able', 'put', 'out', 'certain', 'product', 'paying', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'first', 'Even', 'putting', 'man', 'stage', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'difference', 'real', 'criminals', 'watched', 'part', 'thinking', ""C'mon"", 'now', 'Even', 'comedy', 'was', 'stretch', 'church', 'gossips', 'could', 'see', 'church', 'gossips', 'also', 'tend', 'be', 'paranoid', 'so', 'two', 'blabbermouths', 'leading', 'certain', 'car', 'certain', 'destination', 'was', 'tooth', 'fairy', 'sitting', 'next', 'work', 'were', 'quite', 'few', 'extra', 'characters', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'nothing', 'showed', 'nowhere', 'sing.Pros', 'Speaking', 'singing', 'have', 'rate', 'movie', 'singing', 'would', 'get', '3.75', 'rating', 'singing', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'musicians', 'were', 'phenomenal', 'guy', 'playing', 'horn', 'end', '5', 'stars', 'way', 'loved', 'rewound', 'hear', 'play', 'again', 'Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'personal', 'history', 'Billoah', 'Greene', 'Janine', 'Green', 'characters', 'made', 'one', 'awfully', 'cute', 'couple', 'onscreen', 'names', 'are', 'already', 'Green', 'one', 'e', 'hint', 'hint', 'hope', 'gave', 'chance', 'when', 'cameras', 'were', ""n't""]",Preaching To The Choir
