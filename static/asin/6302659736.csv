326452,A1LMBOI3T91P87,6302659736,Allan M. Lees,"[16, 17]","After the success of Around the World in Eighty Days, Michael Palin embarked on a highly successful career as an adventure tourist.  Each of his journeys has a hook: circumnavigating the Pacific Rim, going across the Sahara Desert, or in this case making the journey from the north pole to the south pole following as best as possible longitude 30 degrees.Along the way, from snow to savannah, from Norway to Nairobi, the charm of Palin's travels comes from the unassuming way he interacts with the people he meets on route.  His personality carries the relatively unstructured travalog along on a sea of well-meaning interest and curiosity.  He tells us when he's tired, anxious, and bored.  We are touched by the genuine friendships he makes, however fleetingly, and the partings are often touching.  In Pole to Pole the meat of the journey is Africa and we travel from relatively cosmopolitan Egypt to what in politically incorrect days was referred to as Darkest Africa.  Even in 1991 witchdoctors outnumbered the western kind, and random violence was never far from view.  Indeed, at one point Palin stays with a European estate owner in Zambia and his family and after the visit is concluded we learn from the voice-over that they were slaughtered six months later.I spent a few formative years in southern Africa and it was shocking to me to see how little had changed since last I saw it.  If anything, most of the change was for the worse: the old trains and buses simply have grown older, the disorder greater.  Only in South Africa did time seem to have moved on.  For the casual viewer the sheer range of experience in Africa should be fascinating, even though we get the merest glimpse.  How can one capture a continent in just a few minutes of video?  Like many people, I suspect, my favorite moments were of Palin sitting on top of the slow train creaking its way through Sudan, talking with those who can't afford to travel any other way, and seeming perfectly at home.  Somehow Palin makes us forget how unlikely it all is: a well-paid BBC personality squatting among the illiterate and impoverished, interacting with them as though it were the most natural thing in the world.  Perhaps no other TV presenter could really pull it off convincingly.In the end the ""hook"" seems a little forced: Palin flies in to the north pole and he flies in to the south pole.  It's not really much of an epic journey but it was more hazardous than it might seem: when he made the trip to the South Pole there was inadequate navigation and infrastructure and it would have been all too easy for him to have perished due to half-baked preparation and execution on the part of those tasked with ferrying him around.  Fortunately all survived and went on to make several other telejourneys to various parts of the world; journeys which are now slowly being remastered onto DVD and released by the BBC.  If you don't have the chance to travel much beyond the usual tourist haunts, by all means pick up a copy of Palin's travels and experience the sights, sounds, and people you will otherwise never know of.",4,"On top of the world, and underneath it",1193184000,"10 24, 2007",2007,3103,"['success', 'World', 'Eighty', 'Days', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'embarked', 'highly', 'successful', 'career', 'adventure', 'tourist', 'journeys', 'hook', 'circumnavigating', 'Pacific', 'Rim', 'going', 'Sahara', 'Desert', 'case', 'making', 'journey', 'north', 'pole', 'south', 'pole', 'following', 'as', 'best', 'possible', 'longitude', '30', 'way', 'snow', 'savannah', 'Norway', 'Nairobi', 'charm', 'Palin', 'travels', 'unassuming', 'way', 'people', 'route', 'personality', 'relatively', 'unstructured', 'travalog', 'sea', 'well-meaning', 'interest', 'curiosity', 'when', 'tired', 'anxious', 'bored', 'are', 'touched', 'genuine', 'friendships', 'however', 'fleetingly', 'partings', 'are', 'often', 'touching', 'Pole', 'Pole', 'meat', 'journey', 'Africa', 'travel', 'relatively', 'cosmopolitan', 'Egypt', 'what', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'days', 'was', 'referred', 'Darkest', 'Africa', 'Even', '1991', 'witchdoctors', 'outnumbered', 'western', 'kind', 'random', 'violence', 'was', 'never', 'far', 'view', 'Indeed', 'one', 'point', 'Palin', 'European', 'estate', 'owner', 'Zambia', 'family', 'visit', 'concluded', 'learn', 'voice-over', 'were', 'slaughtered', 'six', 'months', 'later.I', 'spent', 'few', 'formative', 'years', 'southern', 'Africa', 'was', 'shocking', 'see', 'how', 'little', 'had', 'changed', 'last', 'saw', 'anything', 'most', 'change', 'was', 'worse', 'old', 'trains', 'buses', 'simply', 'have', 'grown', 'older', 'disorder', 'greater', 'Only', 'South', 'Africa', 'did', 'time', 'seem', 'have', 'moved', 'casual', 'viewer', 'sheer', 'range', 'experience', 'Africa', 'should', 'be', 'fascinating', 'even', 'get', 'merest', 'glimpse', 'How', 'can', 'one', 'capture', 'continent', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'video', 'many', 'people', 'suspect', 'favorite', 'moments', 'were', 'Palin', 'sitting', 'top', 'slow', 'train', 'creaking', 'way', 'Sudan', 'talking', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'travel', 'other', 'way', 'seeming', 'perfectly', 'home', 'Somehow', 'Palin', 'forget', 'how', 'unlikely', 'well-paid', 'BBC', 'personality', 'squatting', 'illiterate', 'impoverished', 'interacting', 'were', 'most', 'natural', 'thing', 'world', 'Perhaps', 'other', 'TV', 'presenter', 'could', 'really', 'pull', 'off', 'end', 'hook', 'little', 'forced', 'Palin', 'flies', 'north', 'pole', 'south', 'pole', 'not', 'really', 'much', 'epic', 'journey', 'was', 'more', 'hazardous', 'might', 'seem', 'when', 'made', 'trip', 'South', 'Pole', 'was', 'inadequate', 'navigation', 'infrastructure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'easy', 'have', 'perished', 'due', 'half-baked', 'preparation', 'execution', 'part', 'tasked', 'ferrying', 'around', 'Fortunately', 'survived', 'went', 'make', 'several', 'other', 'telejourneys', 'various', 'parts', 'world', 'journeys', 'are', 'now', 'slowly', 'being', 'remastered', 'DVD', 'released', 'BBC', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'travel', 'much', 'usual', 'tourist', 'haunts', 'means', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'Palin', 'travels', 'experience', 'sights', 'people', 'will', 'otherwise', 'never', 'know']",N/A

As with 80 days, and his subsequent travels, ""Pole to Pole"" is filled with a great, warm spirit of enthusiasm, interest, and real, honest, good humour. Palin guides us, the viewers, through the many different countries and cultures with his usual witty and insightful commentary, and does what the travel industry calls 'the Palin effect' (that you want to go where Palin has gone) great honour.Describing Palins travel programmes in one word is impossible, but if I had to choose or be beaten to death with a shoe, I'd describe them as inspiring. Truly, utterly, completely, magnificently, and really inspiring. And there cannot possibly be any other quality in a travel programme that is better than that.The extra material on the DVDs are, as with all the other series, abundant.

Easy going company with a terrific sense of humor and abundant patience. All things I lack. And I love travelogues too. This is the first of a series - that even he might not have anticipated would have as long a run as they have over the years. This is also a very interesting time in history. I remember it well. I also have a couple of points of comparison too, so it makes me very nostalgic as I see him passing through the former Soviet Union, and through the port city of Odessa on the Black Sea - where I had passed through the year before in 1990. And it is incredible to watch as he makes his way through the Middle East and Africa - and then trying to imagine that same trip being made today. He'd probably be killed. Today's world is but 20 years removed, but it is world's away in terms of the new political realities. This also makes this interesting viewing - comparing and contrasting where we have come from and where we are now with some of these countries he passed through. Some of it was pretty touch and go at the time, but Palin handles it well - or if he didn't, then those moments ended up on the cutting room floor. What a great journey.

326459,A15XTHGM4VS4WH,6302659736,Rennie Petersen,"[3, 3]","This review is based on watching the DVD version of ""Pole to Pole"", the BBC TV program made in 1991 that showed Michael Palin traveling from the North Pole to the South Pole.The trip was based on several rules. The use of aircraft was only allowed when surface travel was not possible, and public transportation was used as much as possible. The trip attempted to follow the 30 degree east longitude line, down through Scandinavia, the then-existing USSR, Turkey and all the way down through the continent of Africa.The trip took five months and was quite arduous at times. Transportation was almost non-existent in central Africa, parts of Africa had to be avoided due to civil war and Michael Palin was hit by several health problems including two cracked ribs.The wonderful thing about Michael Palin's travelogues is the enthusiasm, wit and charm that Mr. Palin shows. There are many impromptu encounters with the local people that are humorous and interesting. And, of course, there's the beautiful photography showing the stunning nature that was found along the way.On the down side it was depressing to see the poverty and hints of political repression and social unrest in parts of Africa. The AIDS epidemic in Africa was also mentioned, and Michael Palin visited an evacuated village near Chernobyl.This trip was made in 1991 and already when the trip was over world history had changed the landscape, in that the USSR completely unraveled shortly after Michael Palin traveled through it. The years that have passed since 1991 can be noticed in other ways too. For example, the situation in most of Africa has unfortunately gotten worse rather than better. And Antarctica, almost completely inaccessible in 1991, now has a tourist trade with 23,000 landed tourists during the 2004-2005 season!The DVD version of this trip consists of three discs. These contain eight 50-minute episodes (total of six hours 40 minutes) and, as extra material, a 30-minute interview with Michael Palin. I found the interview to be very interesting and am glad that it was included.Highly recommended, as is the book version of this trip and all of Michael Palin's other trips, both in DVD version and as books.Rennie Petersen",5,North Pole to South Pole via Africa,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,2215,"['review', 'based', 'watching', 'DVD', 'version', 'Pole', 'Pole', 'BBC', 'TV', 'program', 'made', '1991', 'showed', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'traveling', 'North', 'Pole', 'South', 'Pole.The', 'trip', 'was', 'based', 'several', 'rules', 'use', 'aircraft', 'was', 'only', 'allowed', 'when', 'surface', 'travel', 'was', 'not', 'possible', 'public', 'transportation', 'was', 'used', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'trip', 'attempted', 'follow', '30', 'degree', 'east', 'longitude', 'line', 'down', 'Scandinavia', 'then-existing', 'USSR', 'Turkey', 'way', 'down', 'continent', 'Africa.The', 'trip', 'took', 'five', 'months', 'was', 'quite', 'arduous', 'times', 'Transportation', 'was', 'almost', 'non-existent', 'central', 'Africa', 'parts', 'Africa', 'had', 'be', 'avoided', 'due', 'civil', 'war', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'was', 'hit', 'several', 'health', 'problems', 'including', 'two', 'cracked', 'ribs.The', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'travelogues', 'enthusiasm', 'wit', 'charm', 'Mr.', 'Palin', 'are', 'many', 'impromptu', 'encounters', 'local', 'people', 'are', 'humorous', 'interesting', 'course', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'showing', 'stunning', 'nature', 'was', 'found', 'way.On', 'down', 'side', 'was', 'depressing', 'see', 'poverty', 'hints', 'political', 'repression', 'social', 'unrest', 'parts', 'Africa', 'AIDS', 'epidemic', 'Africa', 'was', 'also', 'mentioned', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'visited', 'evacuated', 'village', 'Chernobyl.This', 'trip', 'was', 'made', '1991', 'already', 'when', 'trip', 'was', 'world', 'history', 'had', 'changed', 'landscape', 'USSR', 'completely', 'unraveled', 'shortly', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'traveled', 'years', 'have', 'passed', '1991', 'can', 'be', 'noticed', 'other', 'ways', 'too', 'example', 'situation', 'most', 'Africa', 'unfortunately', 'gotten', 'worse', 'rather', 'better', 'Antarctica', 'almost', 'completely', 'inaccessible', '1991', 'now', 'tourist', 'trade', '23,000', 'landed', 'tourists', '2004-2005', 'season', 'DVD', 'version', 'trip', 'three', 'discs', 'contain', 'eight', '50-minute', 'episodes', 'total', 'six', 'hours', '40', 'minutes', 'extra', 'material', '30-minute', 'interview', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'found', 'interview', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'am', 'glad', 'was', 'included.Highly', 'recommended', 'book', 'version', 'trip', 'Michael', 'Palin', 'other', 'trips', 'DVD', 'version', 'books.Rennie', 'Petersen']",N/A

326461,A2329GPAT2XIIZ,6302659736,Ultimate Reviewer,"[6, 36]","This is another of those programmes that has, and will be, repeated ad nauseam on UK TV, but why, I can only put down to the popularity of Michael Palin and the fact that there's a lot of air time to fill, so repeats are a cheap alternative to new programmes! Following the success of &quot;Aroung the world in 80 days&quot; they decided to send Palin on another gimmick travelogue on celluloid. Unfortunately, &quot;Pole to Pole&quot; pales by comparison. Although it sets out rather well, when Palin gets to Africa - and there is an awful lot of Africa in &quot;Pole to Pole&quot;, things get very dull, and you get the feeling that Palin is also bored by the experience a little too. Once you have crossed the deserts of North Africa, from there down, everything looks pretty much the same. One mud hut looks like another; one smiling black face looks like any other smiling black face; you've seen one elephant and you've seen them all and when the jeeps get stuck in the mud yet again, you can but roll your eyes and look at the clock to see when the net programme begins!Finally, to cap it all, &quot;Pole&quot; ends with an anticlimax, much as &quot;80 days&quot; did, with Palin not being able to finish his journey at the Reform Club in London. This time, however, Palin is no where near the South Pole, as someone at the BBC did not make sure that the supply boat which only sails once a year from the Cape to the South Pole had room for the expedition team! It just ends with the feeling that there should be one more episode - Palin sits on the dock with his back to the camera and just says something on the lines of &quot;That's all folks&quot;. I expected more. I mean, couldn't they have layed on a jet or something, even just to complete the journey. They could have lied, even, and said that he had made the boat aafter all.
