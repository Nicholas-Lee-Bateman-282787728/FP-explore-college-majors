He finds love and will attempt to escape from his life as a spy and possible his imminent death.  But how can he trust and what secrets do they old.  Is it always the last person you would guess or will this story be different?There is nothing new or earthshaking about the story. But it is the stories we know that we like to see retold.

1410698,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B004IFYMSE,Douglas King,"[3, 3]","*** 1/2""You can't know everything about someone and still like them,"" says one of the young psychics (or ""scopers"" as they're referred to) who works for a covert government operation in this low-key little sci-fi film. Dialogue like this makes it clear that in this film, by adding unreal elements to the story, the storytellers are really trying to explore truths about the human condition.For the most part, the film succeeds. Joshua (Nick Stahl), who belongs to the group of covert government psychics, has spent his entire life being told that his psychic abilities (dubbed Widmann's Syndrome) will drive him insane by his 29th birthday, after which he will have to choose between being a permanent vegetable or ending his life. Already 28, Joshua has begun to prepare for the end, until he meets Mia, another young psychic not affiliated with his group, who claims to be 31 and doing just fine. This leads Joshua to rethink what he's been told his entire life, and rethink his allegiance to the mentor who he had always believed had his best interests in mind.Despite a handful of action scenes, most of the film involves dialogue and relationships. When he meets Mia and falls in love with her, the film explores how much you have to know (or should know) about someone in order to have a relationship with them. And when Joshua begins to realize the lies he's been told throughout his life in order to serve the selfish and amoral desires of those around him, the film explores how much of what we're told from ""authority figures"" is just propaganda meant to keep us all in line and productive.The film is clearly low-budget, and the special affects, although used fairly sparingly, reflect that. But the film is really a low-key, thoughtful indie film, not a sci-fi/action film, and because it keeps its focus on the characters it remains worthwhile. Nick Stahl, a long-underrated actor in my opinion, is an intriguing leading man, which also helps elevate the film.",3,Allegory,1318377600,"10 12, 2011",2011,1974,"['1/2', 'ca', ""n't"", 'know', 'everything', 'someone', 'still', 'one', 'young', 'psychics', 'scopers', ""'re"", 'referred', 'who', 'covert', 'government', 'operation', 'low-key', 'little', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'Dialogue', 'clear', 'film', 'adding', 'unreal', 'elements', 'story', 'storytellers', 'are', 'really', 'trying', 'explore', 'truths', 'human', 'most', 'part', 'film', 'Joshua', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'who', 'group', 'covert', 'government', 'psychics', 'spent', 'entire', 'life', 'being', 'told', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'dubbed', 'Widmann', 'Syndrome', 'will', 'drive', 'insane', '29th', 'birthday', 'will', 'have', 'choose', 'being', 'permanent', 'vegetable', 'ending', 'life', 'Already', '28', 'Joshua', 'begun', 'prepare', 'end', 'Mia', 'young', 'psychic', 'not', 'affiliated', 'group', 'who', 'be', '31', 'doing', 'just', 'fine', 'Joshua', 'rethink', 'what', 'been', 'told', 'entire', 'life', 'rethink', 'allegiance', 'mentor', 'who', 'had', 'always', 'believed', 'had', 'best', 'interests', 'mind.Despite', 'handful', 'action', 'scenes', 'most', 'film', 'dialogue', 'relationships', 'When', 'Mia', 'love', 'film', 'how', 'much', 'have', 'know', 'should', 'know', 'someone', 'order', 'have', 'relationship', 'when', 'Joshua', 'realize', 'lies', 'been', 'told', 'life', 'order', 'serve', 'selfish', 'amoral', 'desires', 'film', 'how', 'much', 'what', ""'re"", 'told', 'authority', 'figures', 'just', 'propaganda', 'meant', 'keep', 'line', 'productive.The', 'film', 'clearly', 'low-budget', 'special', 'affects', 'used', 'fairly', 'sparingly', 'reflect', 'film', 'really', 'low-key', 'thoughtful', 'indie', 'film', 'not', 'sci-fi/action', 'film', 'focus', 'characters', 'worthwhile', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'long-underrated', 'actor', 'opinion', 'intriguing', 'leading', 'man', 'also', 'elevate', 'film']",N/A

The mind-readers, the fact that the government controls them and uses them for their own ends, the bleakness of their existence - they don't tend to live past age 28... The concept is great - the execution? Not so much.John's (Nick Stahl) attempt to save his life, and learn the truth after meeting someone who has his ability and is still alive after age 30, is very riveting and interesting. I also enjoyed the dialogue and exploration of human relationships, being ""other"", and the human condition.However, Nick Stahl's portrayal of John seemed hollow to me.

1410700,A1TP2RW7KDI5AZ,B004IFYMSE,"John Werner ""JWW""","[4, 5]","The Speed of Thought is a movie with a classic sci-fi/fantasy setup:  A young man knows what those around him are thinking.  In short order we find out that the colloquial term from these so afflicted with this ability is ""scopers"" and that the condition itself is called Widmann's Syndrome.  Because the talent of knowing what is in someone else's mind is akin to a cheaper, more effective, wire tap without the requirement of a court order, the NSA leverages some of the better scopers by funding a home where the scopers can be treated and/or maintained.  The scopers keep the NSA revenue stream up by doing some questionable work for ""the greater good"".  Is it possible to take a somewhat hackneyed basic premise and build a decent movie around it...We'll see?The central character named Joshua Lazarus (Nick Stahl) has been raised in an NSA home due to his telepathic powers and the complications thereof.  In the course of his growing up he believes that like his brother, who also is afflicted by Widmann's Syndrome, he will eventually lose his sanity due to the inability to control ""the voices"" which before he turns 30 will likely either incapacitate , cause him to choose a humane end, or, outright kill him. In the course of his work he chances to meet a beautiful young woman, Anna Manheim (Mia Maestro) with like telepathic powers.  She doesn't realize there are others with the same strange ability, but intriguing to Joshua neither does she seem to be afflicted by the voices which with increasing tendencies are starting to do their bidding of insanity.  Joshua begins to feel, perhaps, he has been given misinformation, as well as bogus drug therapy regarding his condition.  At this point, to be clear, this is pretty much a young-audience targeted love story instead of an mind-bending science fiction movie.  By the time I settled on this I wasn't very interested in either unfortunately.  This is due to a couple of key factors.  First, the screenplay is downright weak, and, outside of Nick Stahl, everybody is giving lackluster performances of already weak characters.  The special effects are, if anything, a handicapping factor due to being more laughable than effective.Joshua decides to try to break free of his affliction because he isn't ready to give in to the fate of his brother or to end his life to avoid the same.  With urgency brought on by ""the voices"" increasing grip, Joshua accepts Mia's help in his quest to control his destiny.  I was hopeful since at this point there's finally a bit of action the film would improve - no such luck as everything continues to be laughable, milk toast presented, not well acted outside of Stahl, and boring.All in all, it seems this is a third-tier Sci-Fi network film.  I don't mean to be harsh, but I really can't say anything here raises this film to much of anything I can recommend.  In defense of ""The Speed of Thought"" it is rumored to have a meager two-million dollar budget.  Unfortunately, a couple of mil was, more or less, wasted in spite of a semi-respectable, actually decent, overall idea and Nick Stahl's attempt to turn in a decent performance.",2,Promising Sci-Fi Flick Hampered By Low Budget & Lackluster Screenplay,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,3137,"['Speed', 'Thought', 'movie', 'classic', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'setup', 'young', 'man', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'short', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'colloquial', 'term', 'so', 'afflicted', 'ability', 'scopers', 'condition', 'called', 'Widmann', 'Syndrome', 'talent', 'knowing', 'what', 'someone', 'else', 'mind', 'akin', 'cheaper', 'more', 'effective', 'wire', 'tap', 'requirement', 'court', 'order', 'NSA', 'better', 'scopers', 'funding', 'home', 'where', 'scopers', 'can', 'be', 'treated', 'and/or', 'maintained', 'scopers', 'keep', 'NSA', 'revenue', 'stream', 'up', 'doing', 'questionable', 'work', 'greater', 'good', 'possible', 'take', 'somewhat', 'hackneyed', 'basic', 'premise', 'build', 'decent', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'central', 'character', 'named', 'Joshua', 'Lazarus', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'been', 'raised', 'NSA', 'home', 'due', 'telepathic', 'powers', 'complications', 'thereof', 'course', 'growing', 'up', 'brother', 'who', 'also', 'afflicted', 'Widmann', 'Syndrome', 'will', 'eventually', 'lose', 'sanity', 'due', 'inability', 'control', 'voices', '30', 'will', 'likely', 'either', 'incapacitate', 'cause', 'choose', 'humane', 'end', 'outright', 'kill', 'course', 'work', 'meet', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'Anna', 'Manheim', 'Mia', 'Maestro', 'like', 'telepathic', 'powers', ""n't"", 'realize', 'are', 'others', 'same', 'strange', 'ability', 'intriguing', 'Joshua', 'neither', 'seem', 'be', 'afflicted', 'voices', 'increasing', 'tendencies', 'are', 'starting', 'do', 'bidding', 'insanity', 'Joshua', 'feel', 'perhaps', 'been', 'given', 'misinformation', 'as', 'well', 'bogus', 'drug', 'therapy', 'regarding', 'condition', 'point', 'be', 'clear', 'pretty', 'much', 'young-audience', 'targeted', 'story', 'instead', 'mind-bending', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'time', 'settled', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'interested', 'unfortunately', 'due', 'couple', 'key', 'factors', 'First', 'screenplay', 'downright', 'weak', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'everybody', 'giving', 'lackluster', 'performances', 'already', 'weak', 'characters', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'anything', 'handicapping', 'factor', 'due', 'being', 'more', 'laughable', 'effective.Joshua', 'decides', 'try', 'break', 'free', 'affliction', ""n't"", 'ready', 'give', 'fate', 'brother', 'end', 'life', 'avoid', 'same', 'urgency', 'brought', 'voices', 'increasing', 'grip', 'Joshua', 'Mia', 'help', 'quest', 'control', 'destiny', 'was', 'hopeful', 'point', 'finally', 'bit', 'action', 'film', 'would', 'improve', 'such', 'luck', 'everything', 'be', 'laughable', 'milk', 'toast', 'presented', 'not', 'well', 'acted', 'Stahl', 'boring.All', 'third-tier', 'Sci-Fi', 'network', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'be', 'harsh', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'here', 'film', 'much', 'anything', 'can', 'recommend', 'defense', 'Speed', 'Thought', 'rumored', 'have', 'meager', 'two-million', 'dollar', 'budget', 'Unfortunately', 'couple', 'mil', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'wasted', 'spite', 'semi-respectable', 'actually', 'decent', 'overall', 'idea', 'Nick', 'Stahl', 'attempt', 'turn', 'decent', 'performance']",N/A

1410703,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B004IFYMSE,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[1, 1]","There have been a number of science fiction movies and shows out there that tackle many ""what if?"" questions about telepathy and the implications it would have on our lives. Some use the question more as window dressing than story development. Others really try to make you think. As for The Speed of Thought I found the story very compelling and somewhat different than other stories of this kind. It's not a dynamic film, but if you are okay with a more reflective pacing and are more interested in exposition than explosions then this movie is right up your alley.The story is about a telepath working with an institute (for telepaths) essentially living what life he has due to a disease or condition that the essentially ends the life of just about everybody with his gift. He's a mind reader going through the motions until he meets another mind reader that starts to change everything he knows about himself. That's about as close as I can get to the main plot without giving any juicy details away.What I find good about this film is how they move this story forward. You are living life in Johsua's (the mind reader in question) eyes. He parties because he knows his life is almost over because this debilitating condition is starting to take hold. Then when things start changing more interesting facets about his gifts come forward. As you move forward through the movie you get more and more nuggets of details and information about what it means to be a telepath and what benefits and side effects there are.The telepaths seems to have a complicated system of communication between them that involves creating backdrops in their minds when another mind reader comes to ""visit."" It's a pretty interesting concept that, as others have mentioned, starts to lean towards Inception like realities. It's also a place where you learn about how telepaths learn new abilities other than what the film calls ""scoping"" (reading another's mind without permission).Like I said before the movie mostly exposition with a lot of scenes essentially being two people talking. The pacing stay this way for most of the film with only the last half hour or so gaining any kind up upward momentum. And what momentum you get is rather bland if you were expecting any kind of spectacle. I am fine with that. This is a reflective movie that gives you that time to think and reflect while watching.Since it's sci-fi and about people with extraordinary abilities there are some special effects happening when they do scenes inside the minds of the telepaths. It's nothing fancy and at face value can feel like cheap computer generated backdrops. On the other hand I only felt that way the very first time I saw the effect. After that I understood the whole mind's eye thinking behind it and actually welcome the technique they used.This is a low budget film, and it does show. In that I mean what was said about the special effects and the lack of anything dymanic in the locations, sets, cinematography and soundtrack. All of which are serviceable. Just not impressive. The movie rides on the script more than anything else production-wise.Visually I really liked what I saw on my upscaled viewing. It looked pretty close to high def to me with no issues with vibrancy of the images. Audio was good with Dolby 5.1 playing a few surround sound tricks, but nothing to test your speakers with (there is a stereo track also). The DVD has a few extras in that keep this from being a movie-only experience, but you won't see the basic stuff like subtitles, alternate languages, commentaries or movie trailers. Here is the rundown of what you do get:Behind the Scenes - A very short featurette with footage of the director doing his thing.Deleted and Extended Scenes - This is probably the longest running feature, and there is actually some good stuff that was left out. Pretty much unfinished and unpolished footage though. It would have been nice to see a Director's Cut with some of this stuff refined and added. There were some really decent character development scenes that were taken out.Bloopers - Five minutes of people messing up their lines and giggling about it. Nothing to reclaim my faith in the art of blooper reels.So is it one to watch? Depends on what entertains you. Like I said the film had no real action or dramatic scenes. No dialog gushing with emotion. No real dynamic pacing. Just a good story. If that's all you need then by all means check this film out. If you need more this film may end up boring you. I, for one, really liked it and walked away from it with as a very satisfied viewer.",4,Fascinating exploration into the concept of telepathy,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",2013,4598,"['have', 'been', 'number', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'tackle', 'many', 'what', 'questions', 'telepathy', 'implications', 'would', 'have', 'lives', 'use', 'question', 'more', 'window', 'dressing', 'story', 'development', 'Others', 'really', 'try', 'make', 'think', 'Speed', 'Thought', 'found', 'story', 'very', 'compelling', 'somewhat', 'different', 'other', 'stories', 'kind', 'not', 'dynamic', 'film', 'are', 'okay', 'more', 'reflective', 'pacing', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'exposition', 'explosions', 'then', 'movie', 'right', 'alley.The', 'story', 'telepath', 'working', 'institute', 'telepaths', 'essentially', 'living', 'what', 'life', 'due', 'disease', 'condition', 'essentially', 'life', 'just', 'everybody', 'gift', 'mind', 'reader', 'going', 'motions', 'mind', 'reader', 'change', 'everything', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'get', 'main', 'plot', 'giving', 'juicy', 'details', 'find', 'good', 'film', 'how', 'move', 'story', 'forward', 'are', 'living', 'life', 'Johsua', 'mind', 'reader', 'question', 'eyes', 'parties', 'life', 'almost', 'debilitating', 'condition', 'starting', 'take', 'hold', 'Then', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'changing', 'more', 'interesting', 'facets', 'gifts', 'come', 'forward', 'move', 'forward', 'movie', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'nuggets', 'details', 'information', 'what', 'be', 'telepath', 'what', 'benefits', 'side', 'effects', 'there', 'are.The', 'telepaths', 'have', 'complicated', 'system', 'communication', 'creating', 'backdrops', 'minds', 'when', 'mind', 'reader', 'visit', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'concept', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'lean', 'towards', 'Inception', 'realities', 'also', 'place', 'where', 'learn', 'how', 'telepaths', 'learn', 'new', 'abilities', 'other', 'what', 'film', 'scoping', 'reading', 'mind', 'permission', '.Like', 'said', 'movie', 'mostly', 'exposition', 'lot', 'scenes', 'essentially', 'being', 'two', 'people', 'talking', 'pacing', 'stay', 'way', 'most', 'film', 'only', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'gaining', 'kind', 'up', 'upward', 'momentum', 'what', 'momentum', 'get', 'rather', 'bland', 'were', 'expecting', 'kind', 'spectacle', 'am', 'fine', 'reflective', 'movie', 'time', 'think', 'reflect', 'watching.Since', 'sci-fi', 'people', 'extraordinary', 'abilities', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'happening', 'when', 'do', 'scenes', 'minds', 'telepaths', 'nothing', 'fancy', 'face', 'value', 'can', 'feel', 'cheap', 'computer', 'generated', 'backdrops', 'other', 'hand', 'only', 'felt', 'way', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'effect', 'understood', 'whole', 'mind', 'eye', 'thinking', 'actually', 'welcome', 'technique', 'used.This', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'show', 'mean', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'special', 'effects', 'lack', 'anything', 'dymanic', 'locations', 'sets', 'cinematography', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'serviceable', 'Just', 'not', 'impressive', 'movie', 'script', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'production-wise.Visually', 'really', 'liked', 'what', 'saw', 'upscaled', 'viewing', 'looked', 'pretty', 'close', 'high', 'def', 'issues', 'vibrancy', 'images', 'Audio', 'was', 'good', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'playing', 'few', 'surround', 'sound', 'tricks', 'nothing', 'test', 'speakers', 'stereo', 'track', 'also', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'keep', 'being', 'movie-only', 'experience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'basic', 'stuff', 'subtitles', 'alternate', 'languages', 'commentaries', 'movie', 'trailers', 'Here', 'rundown', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'Scenes', 'very', 'short', 'featurette', 'footage', 'director', 'doing', 'thing.Deleted', 'Extended', 'Scenes', 'probably', 'longest', 'running', 'feature', 'actually', 'good', 'stuff', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'Pretty', 'much', 'unfinished', 'unpolished', 'footage', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'Director', 'Cut', 'stuff', 'refined', 'added', 'were', 'really', 'decent', 'character', 'development', 'scenes', 'were', 'taken', 'out.Bloopers', 'Five', 'minutes', 'people', 'messing', 'up', 'lines', 'giggling', 'Nothing', 'reclaim', 'faith', 'art', 'blooper', 'reels.So', 'one', 'watch', 'what', 'said', 'film', 'had', 'real', 'action', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'dialog', 'gushing', 'emotion', 'real', 'dynamic', 'pacing', 'Just', 'good', 'story', 'need', 'then', 'means', 'check', 'film', 'out', 'need', 'more', 'film', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'boring', 'one', 'really', 'liked', 'walked', 'away', 'very', 'satisfied', 'viewer']",N/A
