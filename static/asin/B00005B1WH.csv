579663,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B00005B1WH,Andy Orrock,"[8, 9]","Like many people, I saw 'Amelie' and figured &quot;I'll watch - in fact, seek out - anything with Audrey Tautou.&quot;  There have been some pleasant surprises along that road - 'L'Auberge Espagnole' and 'Dirty Pretty Things' come immediately to mind.  There are some bad ones out there, too.  I did not enjoy sitting through either 'God is Great, I'm Not' or 'Happenstance.'Now, with Ms. Tautou's rising international profile, we're seeing a &quot;Tautou-ization&quot; in the marketing of her earlier films.  In 'Happenstance,' she's just part of the woodwork, yet stands alone on the VHS/DVD coverbox.  In 'Venus Beauty Institute,' it's the same trick pulled on us: the marketers have succeeded in finding the *one* shot in the entire film where she happens to be poised in the center.Which is a shame, because this is Nathalie Baye's film.  51 (and radiantly beautiful) at the time of filming, Ms. Baye doesn't deserve the short shrift she's getting here.  This part was written specifically with her in mind - it's a complex role that very few actresses could do justice to.US audiences will remember Baye as Leonardo DeCaprio's French-born mother in &quot;Catch Me If You Can.&quot;  She was also a standout with Sergi Lopez in &quot;An Affair of Love.&quot;My videocassette tells me this film is categorized as a &quot;Romantic Comedy.  Hardly.  There are elements of humor.  Mostly this is about Ang&egrave;le's (Baye's) humor - the absence of it, along with the spirit and hope that seem to have ebbed out of her life.

579664,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00005B1WH,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[1, 1]","`venus BEAUTY institute' written and directed by Tonie Marshall, in French, with English subtitles, strikes one, on first viewing, as being like some other French movies where nothing of any real consequence seems to happen. The example which comes to mind is Jean Renoir's `The Rules of the Game', one of the all time great movies, and yet not much happens except some intense interaction between the characters, and a seemingly inconsequential accident / murder (ambiguous).While Audrey Tautou gets second billing on the cover, this is due entirely to her later successes. She plays a less important character than Mathilde Seigner or Bulle Ogier, who are billed below her.For one who is not up on French cinema beyond Francois Truffaut's early classics, the great treat in this flick is the performance of Nathalie Baye, who does a job easily comparable to some other great French classics such as Katherine Deneuve and Jeanne Moreau. If this were not a `Romantic Comedy', her role would be comparable to Diane Keaton's dangerous life in `Looking for Mr. Goodbar'.Like `Rules of the Game' and `Jules and Jim' and unlike the fantasies of Ingemar Bergman and Fredrico Fellini, the values in this movie grow out of the reality we see in these characters as they reflect, maybe, some of our own tendencies.I was genuinely astounded at the number of films in which Ms. Baye has appeared (including some late Truffout works such as `Day for Night'). It made me look forward to the pleasures of seeing more of their work, as her performance is what elevates this from a routine comedy to something on the level of `Hannah and Her Sisters' or `When Harry Met Sally'. And yet, it has a distinctly Gallic flavor that I suspect neither Woody Allen nor Rob Reiner could ever capture (although it would be very interesting to see Woody do a parody of a French comedy.)Probably the most endearing invention is the basic venue of a Paris beauty salon whose products and services are probably only marginally effective in making women beautiful and staving off the ravages of age. And yet, Ms. Maye, who has appeared in movies since the 1970s seems to have that ageless quality of Madame Moreau.Terrific flick!",5,Great Romantic Comedy.

Although I personally found the fundamental love-at-first-sight aspect of the story a rather shaky foundation on which to base an otherwise realistic movie, I can't deny the romantic appeal of the wooing and resistance in this fairy-tale.The acting isn't great, but is passable, and really it's all about how sexy and attractive these characters are. Three women who work at a beauty salon each develop romances with men in counterpoint to one another. Our protagonist, Angele, is a cynical and lonely woman who feels that she is unable to love without hurting her loved one. But fantasy man Antoine shows up one day and declares that he has fallen helplessly in love with her--love at first sight--and that he will strive mightily to win her affection and love.It's a charming romance to be sure, but again--really--love at first sight? Even Steve and Janie, my two friends who got together pretty quickly still had to be introduced by friends and even though they were attracted to each other from the outset, they did perform the customary dance of caution and discovery before deciding to get together full-time. I just don't buy the premise that this guy could see the protagonist--at her most needy and dejected--and just flip for her to the extent that he'd sacrifce everything (including his engagement) just to get to know her.Maybe things are different in France, and I suppose that possibility helped my suspend disbelief. At any rate, my wife enjoyed it immensely, and her enjoyment certainly rubbed off on me. Though I like a more gripping, telling story, this one is hard to beat for pure romantic enjoyment.",4,If your date has a romantic streak...,994377600,"07 6, 2001",2001,1658,"['great', 'movie', 'stroke', 'personally', 'found', 'fundamental', 'love-at-first-sight', 'aspect', 'story', 'rather', 'shaky', 'foundation', 'base', 'otherwise', 'realistic', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'romantic', 'appeal', 'wooing', 'resistance', 'fairy-tale.The', 'acting', ""n't"", 'great', 'passable', 'really', 'how', 'sexy', 'attractive', 'characters', 'are', 'Three', 'women', 'who', 'work', 'beauty', 'salon', 'develop', 'men', 'counterpoint', 'one', 'protagonist', 'Angele', 'cynical', 'lonely', 'woman', 'who', 'unable', 'love', 'hurting', 'loved', 'one', 'fantasy', 'man', 'Antoine', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'fallen', 'helplessly', 'love', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'will', 'strive', 'mightily', 'win', 'affection', 'love.It', 'charming', 'romance', 'be', 'sure', 'again', 'really', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Even', 'Steve', 'Janie', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'got', 'together', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'still', 'had', 'be', 'introduced', 'friends', 'even', 'were', 'attracted', 'other', 'outset', 'did', 'perform', 'customary', 'dance', 'caution', 'discovery', 'before', 'deciding', 'get', 'together', 'full-time', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'premise', 'guy', 'could', 'see', 'protagonist', 'most', 'needy', 'dejected', 'just', 'flip', 'extent', ""'d"", 'sacrifce', 'everything', 'including', 'engagement', 'just', 'get', 'know', 'her.Maybe', 'things', 'are', 'different', 'France', 'suppose', 'possibility', 'helped', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'rate', 'wife', 'enjoyed', 'immensely', 'enjoyment', 'certainly', 'rubbed', 'off', 'like', 'more', 'gripping', 'telling', 'story', 'one', 'hard', 'beat', 'pure', 'romantic', 'enjoyment']",N/A
579666,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B00005B1WH,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[1, 1]","Angele is a forty-something woman working at the title place, where women get makeovers, daubed with anti-aging cream, or get suntans under the ultraviolet lamps.  Some men come to get massages, though.  The women and men who leave are refreshed, hopefully inside as well as out, with the former being suggestively sold some product before leaving.  But not Angele, it seems.The story evolves around Angele's love life and that of the other employees.  At the movie's onset, we see Angele chatting with a man who seems to have all the hallmarks of a decent guy, someone who listens, etc. only later, she gets callously dumped.  Antoine, a guy who witnessed the whole thing, falls in love with her and sets out trying to win her over, as his relations with his fiancee are strained.  Despite her brush-offs and not-too inviting demeanor, he seems to genuinely want her, and not be one of her one-night stands.Which brings us back to Angele.  Most of her lonely life after hours is spent picking up men at restaurants or train stations for one-nighters.  She's insecure after an affair with a long-time lover that involved his face being injured.  He's still there, but always doing business abroad.  As a result, she comes off as being defensive, easily annoyed and angry, which doesn't do well for her potential pickups.  She's been so disappointed to the point that she equates love as another form of slavery, her penchant for one-nighters emphasizing her control in her affairs.Angele doesn't seem age-conscious here, but Nadine, the  proprietor of the Venus Beauty Institute, reminds her that Angele should leave and start a salon of her own, the way women her age should.  Her presence here indicates she hasn't grown up, still being one of the &quot;young girls.&quot;  The key is that maybe in finding Mr. Right, she'll be fulfilled enough to progress further in life as expected for women her age.The youngest VBI employee, the sweet and innocent-looking Marie, has an interesting relationship with an elderly pilot whose scarred face was given a skin replacement from his devoted wife.  His wife is dead and Maria's minstrations to it equates to caring for his wife since her demise.  Angele wonders though if anything sinister is going on, given the tips and gifts, including a mink coat, her co-worker gets from the pilot.Samantha doesn't have much luck in her love life, which becomes detrimental in her attitude to work and Nadine later.Other interesting things I noticed is the courtesy the employees give their clients.  Marie in particular thanks the customers for any tips, and even holds open the door for the exiting client.  The most interesting customer is the exhibitionistic Ms. Buisse, who has no qualms about emerging from the tanning rooms full frontal for the public to see, the sight of which draws in gawking males towards the window in one scene.Nathalie Baye shows once again that she is Cesar-worthy material, as she won Best Actress for her role as Angele, joining her other wins for Every Man For Himself and La Balance.  However, it's no surprise that Audrey Tautou won the Most Promising Young Actress award as Marie.  I don't know that a movie like this would have won best picture here, but it's a worthy vehicle for Baye, and one of Tautou's better ones.",4,The struggle of Angele to get a good love life,1084838400,"05 18, 2004",2004,3293,"['Angele', 'forty-something', 'woman', 'working', 'title', 'place', 'where', 'women', 'get', 'makeovers', 'daubed', 'anti-aging', 'cream', 'get', 'suntans', 'ultraviolet', 'lamps', 'men', 'come', 'get', 'massages', 'though', 'women', 'men', 'who', 'leave', 'are', 'refreshed', 'hopefully', 'inside', 'as', 'well', 'out', 'former', 'being', 'suggestively', 'sold', 'product', 'leaving', 'not', 'Angele', 'seems.The', 'story', 'evolves', 'Angele', 'love', 'life', 'other', 'employees', 'movie', 'onset', 'see', 'Angele', 'chatting', 'man', 'who', 'have', 'hallmarks', 'decent', 'guy', 'someone', 'who', 'etc', 'only', 'later', 'callously', 'dumped', 'Antoine', 'guy', 'who', 'witnessed', 'whole', 'thing', 'love', 'out', 'trying', 'win', 'over', 'relations', 'fiancee', 'are', 'strained', 'brush-offs', 'not-too', 'inviting', 'demeanor', 'genuinely', 'want', 'her', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'one-night', 'stands.Which', 'back', 'Angele', 'Most', 'lonely', 'life', 'hours', 'spent', 'picking', 'up', 'men', 'restaurants', 'train', 'stations', 'one-nighters', 'insecure', 'affair', 'long-time', 'lover', 'involved', 'face', 'being', 'injured', 'still', 'there', 'always', 'doing', 'business', 'abroad', 'result', 'off', 'being', 'defensive', 'easily', 'annoyed', 'angry', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'potential', 'pickups', 'been', 'so', 'disappointed', 'point', 'form', 'slavery', 'penchant', 'one-nighters', 'emphasizing', 'control', 'affairs.Angele', ""n't"", 'seem', 'age-conscious', 'here', 'Nadine', 'proprietor', 'Venus', 'Beauty', 'Institute', 'Angele', 'should', 'leave', 'start', 'salon', 'own', 'way', 'women', 'age', 'should', 'presence', 'here', ""n't"", 'grown', 'up', 'still', 'being', 'one', 'quot', 'young', 'girls.', 'quot', 'key', 'maybe', 'finding', 'Mr', 'Right', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fulfilled', 'enough', 'progress', 'further', 'life', 'expected', 'women', 'age.The', 'youngest', 'VBI', 'employee', 'sweet', 'innocent-looking', 'Marie', 'interesting', 'relationship', 'elderly', 'pilot', 'scarred', 'face', 'was', 'given', 'skin', 'replacement', 'devoted', 'wife', 'wife', 'dead', 'Maria', 'minstrations', 'caring', 'wife', 'demise', 'Angele', 'wonders', 'anything', 'sinister', 'going', 'given', 'tips', 'gifts', 'including', 'mink', 'coat', 'co-worker', 'pilot.Samantha', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'luck', 'love', 'life', 'detrimental', 'attitude', 'work', 'Nadine', 'later.Other', 'interesting', 'things', 'noticed', 'courtesy', 'employees', 'give', 'clients', 'Marie', 'particular', 'thanks', 'customers', 'tips', 'even', 'open', 'door', 'exiting', 'client', 'most', 'interesting', 'customer', 'exhibitionistic', 'Ms.', 'Buisse', 'who', 'qualms', 'emerging', 'tanning', 'rooms', 'full', 'frontal', 'public', 'see', 'sight', 'draws', 'gawking', 'males', 'window', 'one', 'scene.Nathalie', 'Baye', 'once', 'again', 'Cesar-worthy', 'material', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'role', 'Angele', 'joining', 'other', 'wins', 'Every', 'Man', 'Himself', 'La', 'Balance', 'However', 'surprise', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'won', 'Most', 'Promising', 'Young', 'Actress', 'award', 'Marie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'won', 'best', 'picture', 'here', 'worthy', 'vehicle', 'Baye', 'one', 'Tautou', 'better', 'ones']",N/A
579667,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005B1WH,Dennis Littrell,"[15, 15]","This stars Nathalie Baye, not Audrey Tautou, of Amelie (2001) fame. (She has a supporting role.) Baye is Angele, a 40-year-old Parisian beautician who has loved and lost a few too many times. Indeed, as the film opens we (and Samuel Le Bihan as Antoine) watch and hear her being dumped once again. Well, she is careless with men. She is perhaps too &quot;easy.&quot; She picks up men, the wrong ones. She is aggressive in her desire. And now she has become cynical. All she wants now are one-nights stands, no more love, no more unbreak my heart. Love is too painful.So when Antoine falls in love with her at something like first sight (I do have a weakness for love at first sight: it is so, so daring, and so, shall we say, unpredictable) she rejects him out of hand even though he is a vital and handsome artist, confident and winning. What IS her problem? But he pursues her even though he is engaged to another (Helene Fillieres). And when she gets drunk and wants some casual sex with him, he says no. He wants her fully in control of her faculties.So this is a romantic comedy of sorts centered around a beauty parlor. However any resemblance to Hollywood movies in the same genre (Shampoo (1975) and Hairspray (1988) somehow come to mind) is purely coincidental. Here the salon is brightly and colorfully lit with a tinker bell as the door opens, and the clientele are eclectic to say the least: an exhibitionist who arrives in a raincoat and nothing else; a rich old man lusting after Tautou; a woman with oozing pimples on her...(never mind)...etc.What makes this work so well is a completely winning performance by Baye, sharp direction by Toni Marshall, and a kind of quirky and blunt realism that eschews all cliche. Tautou fans will be disappointed in her modest part, but she is just adorable in that role. The voyeur scene in which she is willingly seduced by the rich old guy may raise your libido or your envy depending on where you're coming from. Ha!See this for Nathalie Baye who gives the performance of a lifetime, simultaneously subtle and strong, vulnerable and willful.

However, it not only beats language lab, it is film of great depth--and pleasing to the eye. Nathalie Baye, who plays the lead character Angele in the VENUS BEAUTY INSTITUTE, played the wife to Gerhard Depardieu's husband in THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE. She is not a terribly pretty woman, but like most French women she has a &quot;certain something, I know not what&quot; and is a fine actress. The film is currently being marketed as an early Audrey Tautou film (she plays Marie, the 20-year old beautician who becomes involved with an older man), but Tautou has ninth billing and much less screen time than Baye.Angele is very unhappy. She apparently has never been able to make a committment to a man. One man with whom she apparently had an earlier serious relationship appears throughout the film (she runs back to him whenever she is wounded), and it seems she may have once loved him, but somehow she shot him in the face.Angele uses casual sex to deal with her unhappiness. Her tactics frequently led to bad experiences. One day as she is being dumped by her latest jerk, a young man who looks suspiciously like a young relative of Depardieu approaches her and tells her he has fallen in love with her. The rest of the film tells their story--including an ex-fiancee with a gun.This is a beautiful film. The story is beautiful. The film contains beautiful shot after shot. I am attracted to color and the celadon greens, mango pinks, celestial blues, and others are fabulous colors are to die for (think Jamaica). The interior shots of the beauty institute, the apartments, the homes are filled with color and ambient lighting. Poitiers Cathedral at Christmas and the Christmas lights on the street are lovely.I've spent a lot of time in salons being waxed, and plucked, and poked, and baked under a hair drier, and I have never seen the salon so well depicted. The characters who receive Angele's ministrations are treated with loving kindness and lots of hot wax and scented oil.

Ms. Marshall does a great job at examining the lives of three women who toil in a beauty parlor. Angele is cynical about love after she has experienced a lousy relationship with a guy who didn't even acknowledge her. She has been hurt by love and she becomes the aggressor. But being the aggressor doesn't exactly make her a powerful person. She has doubts as to what could have happened if she were patient. Marianne, the optimist, finds love with a widower and former pilot. Angele looks out for her because she fears that she will be hurt by this man. And Samantha is just outrageous. She flirts around but is very selective. She is unhappy with being at the institute.Antoine observes Angele and finds himself drawn to her. Why is he drawn to her? That is what she can't understand. Love has never been fair to Angele. Her father killed her mother thinking that she had a lover behind his back. When he found there wasn't one, he turned the gun on himself. She grew up with her spinster aunts in Poitiers. Although they have their cynicisms about men, they are still optimistic about men. Angele is fearful of love and being loved.Antoine, a young man finds this woman attractive and full of life despite her misery. He looks from a distance at her in the salon she works at. He tells her that he loves her and knows how much in love with her he is. He brings out her inner beauty and allows for her to feel joyful.I loved the scene with Marianne and her beau making love. It was a movie in itself because Angele and Antoine were enthralled to explore their passion for each other rather than break up the affair with them. This movie does have some quirkiness to it. Madame Buisse appears naked to have her daily tanning, a married woman who comes into the salon because her husband wants her to look a certain way for him, and Sam's replacement who tries to turn the salon into a department store.This is a movie that women can enjoy in a group or by themselves. I would definitely watch this movie the second time around. This movie is a lesson in love--it can hurt as well as heal.",5,Good Light-Hearted Movie to Watch,1157673600,"09 8, 2006",2006,2440,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'cable', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'beginning', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'never', 'came', 'back', 'cable', 'again', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'Coming', 'back', 'school', 'looked', 'forward', 'spending', 'Friday', 'night', 'watching', 'rented', 'movies', 'week', 'school', 'work', 'Venus', 'Beauty', 'Institute', 'great', 'movie', 'Ms.', 'Marshall', 'great', 'job', 'examining', 'lives', 'three', 'women', 'who', 'toil', 'beauty', 'parlor', 'Angele', 'cynical', 'love', 'experienced', 'lousy', 'relationship', 'guy', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'acknowledge', 'been', 'hurt', 'love', 'aggressor', 'being', 'aggressor', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'make', 'powerful', 'person', 'doubts', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'were', 'patient', 'Marianne', 'optimist', 'love', 'widower', 'former', 'pilot', 'Angele', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'hurt', 'man', 'Samantha', 'just', 'outrageous', 'very', 'selective', 'unhappy', 'being', 'institute.Antoine', 'Angele', 'drawn', 'Why', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Love', 'never', 'been', 'fair', 'Angele', 'father', 'killed', 'mother', 'thinking', 'had', 'lover', 'back', 'When', 'found', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'turned', 'gun', 'grew', 'up', 'spinster', 'aunts', 'Poitiers', 'have', 'cynicisms', 'men', 'are', 'still', 'optimistic', 'men', 'Angele', 'fearful', 'love', 'being', 'loved.Antoine', 'young', 'man', 'woman', 'attractive', 'full', 'life', 'misery', 'distance', 'salon', 'knows', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'out', 'inner', 'beauty', 'allows', 'feel', 'joyful.I', 'loved', 'scene', 'Marianne', 'beau', 'making', 'love', 'was', 'movie', 'Angele', 'Antoine', 'were', 'enthralled', 'explore', 'passion', 'other', 'rather', 'break', 'up', 'affair', 'movie', 'have', 'quirkiness', 'Madame', 'Buisse', 'naked', 'have', 'daily', 'tanning', 'married', 'woman', 'who', 'salon', 'husband', 'look', 'certain', 'way', 'Sam', 'replacement', 'who', 'turn', 'salon', 'department', 'store.This', 'movie', 'women', 'can', 'enjoy', 'group', 'would', 'definitely', 'watch', 'movie', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'movie', 'lesson', 'love', 'can', 'hurt', 'as', 'well', 'heal']",N/A

Nathalie Baye shines as the center of a trio of beauticians who struggle to find love. It lacks the warmth of a really dynamic look at love, but it is pretty and sometimes heartwarming.Ang&egrave;le (Nathalie Baye) is about forty, and works at a pink, perfumed beauty salon where women and men alike come for skin care, tans and massages. Because of a lover's scarred face, she has sworn off love. Now all she wants are flings and one-night stands, out of fear that her heart will be broken.But one day she is dumped nastily, and a sculptor named Antoine (Samuel Le Bihan) sees everything. Despite being engaged, he falls in love with Ang&egrave;le. But the love-wary Ang&egrave;le pushes him away, and he pursues her even so, determined to break down her defenses and make her see how much he loves her.Tonie Marshall does a fairly good job with a film that looks at love, beauty, and the bitterness that can keep potential love away. It's definitely a unique story, with a beautiful older woman finding love again, but without age jokes or painless romances. It has false starts, misunderstandings, awkwardness and mistakes -- like love.Marshall's film does have some flaws, however. Jacques (Jacques Bonnaffe) is Ang&egrave;le's ex, the guy who has some scarring on his face. They're not particularly bad scars, but the characters act as if he need to wear a half-mask and haunt the Paris Opera House. That superficiality seems reflected in the pretty, shallow look of the salon.But the love stories are quite sweet, including two younger women, one a tough girl and one a sensitive sweetie. Though Ang&egrave;le originally sees love as an enslavement, the movie doesn't see it that way. In here, love is an emotion that can change your life -- it's not enslavement, and it's not perfection. But it can bring happiness.Baye does an excellent job as the embittered Ang&egrave;le, whose fear of love comes from shooting her ex. She stays on the same level as the young women, who are expected to be single. Backing her up is the tough, depressed Samanthe (Mathilde Seigner), and the sweet naive Marie (Audrey Tautou), who is the mistress of a man old enough to be her dad.Despite the picture of Tautou in the middle of the cover, this is Baye's movie. And despite the superficial, cold moments here and there, the bittersweet ""Venus Beauty Institute"" is worth checking out.",3,When you smile I find you handsome,1099353600,"11 2, 2004",2004,2465,"[""n't"", 'bittersweet', 'romance', 'movie', 'Instead', 'bittersweet', 'romance-in-the-making', 'Nathalie', 'Baye', 'shines', 'center', 'trio', 'beauticians', 'who', 'struggle', 'find', 'love', 'warmth', 'really', 'dynamic', 'look', 'love', 'pretty', 'sometimes', 'heartwarming.Ang', 'egrave', 'le', 'Nathalie', 'Baye', 'forty', 'pink', 'perfumed', 'beauty', 'salon', 'where', 'women', 'men', 'alike', 'come', 'skin', 'care', 'tans', 'massages', 'lover', 'scarred', 'face', 'sworn', 'off', 'love', 'Now', 'are', 'flings', 'one-night', 'stands', 'fear', 'heart', 'will', 'be', 'broken.But', 'one', 'day', 'dumped', 'nastily', 'sculptor', 'named', 'Antoine', 'Samuel', 'Le', 'Bihan', 'everything', 'being', 'engaged', 'love', 'Ang', 'egrave', 'le', 'love-wary', 'Ang', 'egrave', 'le', 'pushes', 'away', 'even', 'so', 'determined', 'break', 'down', 'defenses', 'make', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'her.Tonie', 'Marshall', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'film', 'love', 'beauty', 'bitterness', 'can', 'keep', 'potential', 'love', 'away', 'definitely', 'unique', 'story', 'beautiful', 'older', 'woman', 'finding', 'love', 'again', 'age', 'jokes', 'painless', 'romances', 'false', 'starts', 'misunderstandings', 'awkwardness', 'mistakes', 'love.Marshall', 'film', 'have', 'flaws', 'however', 'Jacques', 'Jacques', 'Bonnaffe', 'Ang', 'egrave', 'le', 'ex', 'guy', 'who', 'scarring', 'face', ""'re"", 'not', 'particularly', 'bad', 'scars', 'characters', 'act', 'need', 'wear', 'half-mask', 'haunt', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'House', 'superficiality', 'reflected', 'pretty', 'shallow', 'look', 'salon.But', 'love', 'stories', 'are', 'quite', 'sweet', 'including', 'two', 'younger', 'women', 'one', 'tough', 'girl', 'one', 'sensitive', 'sweetie', 'Though', 'Ang', 'egrave', 'originally', 'love', 'enslavement', 'movie', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'here', 'love', 'emotion', 'can', 'change', 'life', 'not', 'enslavement', 'not', 'perfection', 'can', 'bring', 'happiness.Baye', 'excellent', 'job', 'embittered', 'Ang', 'egrave', 'le', 'fear', 'love', 'shooting', 'ex', 'same', 'level', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'expected', 'be', 'single', 'Backing', 'up', 'tough', 'depressed', 'Samanthe', 'Mathilde', 'Seigner', 'sweet', 'naive', 'Marie', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'who', 'mistress', 'man', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'dad.Despite', 'picture', 'Tautou', 'middle', 'cover', 'Baye', 'movie', 'superficial', 'cold', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'bittersweet', 'Venus', 'Beauty', 'Institute', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

Though Audrey is as enchanting as I've ever seen her, perhaps I was too hasty.The focal point of the film is a French beauty shop, which offers mud packs, massages, a tanning booth, depilatory treatments, and the usual array of cosmetics. The heroine is Angele (Nathalie Baye), whose love life, or lack of one, is pretty much the plot. As the movie opens, Angele, no longer in youth's bloom and on the wrong side of thirty, is professing a budding affection to a younger man, who, the cad, callously dumps her after a weekend stand. As an emotional defense, Angele bitterly retreats behind the walls of Woman Scorned. Soon faced with a complete stranger, Antoine (Samuel Le Bihan), who ardently professes his undying love, Angele is determined to keep him at arm's length. In the meantime, Angele's sweetly innocent co-worker, Marie (Tautou), is slowly being seduced by a much older man who regularly visits the shop for facials. Then there's the third beautician, Samantha (Mathilde Seigner), who's only waiting to give the shop's owner, Madame Nadine (Bulle Ogier), the proverbial finger before returning to a real job - nursing.If the strength of VENUS BEAUTY INSTITUTE lies in its depiction of the on-the-job interaction between the shop's employees, then the film is perhaps too much of a chick flick for me, though my wife wasn't terribly impressed with it either. Watching Angele's angst do battle with hormones wasn't riveting cinema.Audrey Tautou is perhaps even more enthralling than that other love of my life, Audrey Hepburn. As I've stated before, Tautou's liquid brown eyes could melt linoleum. She doesn't disappoint in this film, though her role is disappointingly small. And, male pig that I am, I did pay close attention when one of the shop's statuesquely beautiful customers (Claire Nebout), an exhibitionist, twice strutted all her stuff full frontal. Beyond these diversions, however, VENUS BEAUTY INSTITUTE was a yawner.

THAT makes the film is worth watching, don't you think?DVD or VHS's cover will show you three workers (how do you say in English?) at a beauty salon, clad in vivid pink, but the film's main story follows Nathalie Baye's character, Angele, now forty-years-old, whose relationships with a man she loved  in the past, it is implied, had not been an easy one.  The moment she is ditched by a guy after a 3-days love affair, she encounters a new love without her knowing; in fact, you see  behind that guy, an artist Antoine (Samuel Le Bihan, seen in &quot;Brotherhood of Wolf&quot;) falls in love at first sight.  Suddenly she is told that he loves her, and he keeps on coming in spite of her repeated rejection.  Should she accept his love, instead of having an easy relations with forgettable dates, knowing that loving means complicated things, as she experienced before....In the meanwhile, Angele's co-workers have their own relationships, and they are told (or implied) in a very subdued, subtle way.  Samantha (played by Mathilde Seinger, younger sister of Emmanuelle of &quot;The Nineth Gate&quot; and Harrison Ford film &quot;Frantic&quot;) seems to keep on having dates every night with different boys.  Other worker, youngest Marie (lovely Tautou) is courted by an old, kind gentleman who asks her to come to his house.  Among these well-drawn characters, you will meet many strange customers coming to the salon, who make you smile, including a totally naked &quot;Madame Buisse&quot;(!) coming to salon wearing ... a overcoat only.The greatest virtue of &quot;Beauty Venus&quot; is Nathalie Baye's marvellous acting, which convincingly portrays Angele's fragile side of character, who cannot trust herself to anybody  anymore.  Her insecurity is sometimes very poignantly  expressed, but her pain comes very naturally, because always  superb Baye never relies on overacting here.  That makes a good contrast to Audrey Tautou's innocent love, which is also an impressive part of the film.  For all simple, and in a sense too familiar story of the film, &quot;Venus Beauty&quot; is a memorable film that makes you feel good, thanks to its romantic (but not sugary) atomosphere and insightful study of characters.Using striking blue and pink colors, the director Tonie Marhall creates a small magical world where pains and regrets of ordinary people are not forgotten, but are presented with a delicate overtone.  Everything is told in a understated voice, so you might feel the film is too slow-moving or dull at some times, but good performance and realistic feeling of the salon (they really made it on the street) make up for that.  I assure you that next time you go to a beauty salon, you will smile remembering those colorful characters of &quot;Venus Beauty Institute.&quot;The film also gives extra fun to French cinema fans.  Look for faces of Frederic Andrei (star of &quot;Diva&quot; -- long time no see), Claire Denis (director of &quot;Nenette and Boni&quot; -- Vince Gallo was there, remember?), Philippe Harel (director of &quot;The Banned Woman&quot;) and many, many veteran actors.  And Tante Maryse (one of Angele's aunts) is Micheline Presle, the director's mother.",4,Welcome to &quot;Venus Beauty&quot; where Amelie Met Her First Love,1015113600,"03 3, 2002",2002,3553,"['hit', 'back', 'France', 'quot', 'Venus', 'Beauty', 'Institute', 'quot', 'came', 'here', 'Japan', 'USA', 'am', 'afraid', 'film', 'was', 'seeking', 'audience', 'very', 'hard', 'theater', 'though', 'pity', 'quot', 'Venus', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'superb', 'performance', 'place', 'where', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'Amelie', 'was', 'working', 'landed', 'cafe', 'Paris', 'THAT', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'cover', 'will', 'show', 'three', 'workers', 'how', 'do', 'say', 'English', 'beauty', 'salon', 'clad', 'vivid', 'pink', 'film', 'main', 'story', 'Nathalie', 'Baye', 'character', 'Angele', 'now', 'forty-years-old', 'relationships', 'man', 'loved', 'past', 'implied', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'easy', 'one', 'moment', 'ditched', 'guy', '3-days', 'love', 'affair', 'new', 'love', 'knowing', 'fact', 'see', 'guy', 'artist', 'Antoine', 'Samuel', 'Le', 'Bihan', 'seen', 'quot', 'Brotherhood', 'Wolf', 'quot', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Suddenly', 'told', 'coming', 'spite', 'repeated', 'rejection', 'Should', 'accept', 'love', 'instead', 'having', 'easy', 'relations', 'forgettable', 'dates', 'knowing', 'loving', 'means', 'complicated', 'things', 'experienced', '.In', 'meanwhile', 'Angele', 'co-workers', 'have', 'own', 'relationships', 'are', 'told', 'implied', 'very', 'subdued', 'subtle', 'way', 'Samantha', 'played', 'Mathilde', 'Seinger', 'younger', 'sister', 'Emmanuelle', 'quot', 'Nineth', 'Gate', 'quot', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'film', 'quot', 'Frantic', 'quot', 'keep', 'having', 'dates', 'night', 'different', 'boys', 'Other', 'worker', 'youngest', 'Marie', 'lovely', 'Tautou', 'courted', 'old', 'kind', 'gentleman', 'who', 'come', 'house', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'will', 'meet', 'many', 'strange', 'customers', 'coming', 'salon', 'who', 'make', 'smile', 'including', 'totally', 'naked', 'quot', 'Madame', 'Buisse', 'quot', 'coming', 'salon', 'wearing', 'overcoat', 'only.The', 'greatest', 'virtue', 'quot', 'Beauty', 'Venus', 'quot', 'Nathalie', 'Baye', 'marvellous', 'acting', 'convincingly', 'Angele', 'fragile', 'side', 'character', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'trust', 'anybody', 'anymore', 'insecurity', 'sometimes', 'very', 'poignantly', 'expressed', 'pain', 'very', 'naturally', 'always', 'superb', 'Baye', 'never', 'overacting', 'here', 'good', 'contrast', 'Audrey', 'Tautou', 'innocent', 'love', 'also', 'impressive', 'part', 'film', 'simple', 'sense', 'too', 'familiar', 'story', 'film', 'quot', 'Venus', 'Beauty', 'quot', 'memorable', 'film', 'feel', 'good', 'thanks', 'romantic', 'not', 'sugary', 'atomosphere', 'insightful', 'study', 'characters.Using', 'striking', 'blue', 'pink', 'colors', 'director', 'Tonie', 'Marhall', 'small', 'magical', 'world', 'where', 'pains', 'regrets', 'ordinary', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'forgotten', 'are', 'presented', 'delicate', 'overtone', 'Everything', 'told', 'understated', 'voice', 'might', 'feel', 'film', 'too', 'slow-moving', 'dull', 'times', 'good', 'performance', 'realistic', 'feeling', 'salon', 'really', 'made', 'street', 'make', 'up', 'assure', 'next', 'time', 'go', 'beauty', 'salon', 'will', 'smile', 'remembering', 'colorful', 'characters', 'quot', 'Venus', 'Beauty', 'Institute.', 'quot', 'film', 'also', 'extra', 'fun', 'French', 'cinema', 'fans', 'Look', 'Frederic', 'Andrei', 'star', 'quot', 'Diva', 'quot', 'long', 'time', 'see', 'Claire', 'Denis', 'director', 'quot', 'Nenette', 'Boni', 'quot', 'Vince', 'Gallo', 'was', 'there', 'remember', 'Philippe', 'Harel', 'director', 'quot', 'Banned', 'Woman', 'quot', 'many', 'many', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Tante', 'Maryse', 'one', 'Angele', 'aunts', 'Micheline', 'Presle', 'director', 'mother']",N/A
579682,A3AW8XP45YVIIZ,B00005B1WH,Utah Blaine,"[3, 3]","I got this movie because it stars Nathalie Baye and expected it to be a light hearted romantic comedy (i.e. a chick flick) based on the cover photo and the text on the back of the case.  That will teach me to never judge a book by it's cover.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised upon watching it, this film has considerable depth and complexity.  The story is about a woman (Nathalie Baye) who works as a beautician and who is looking for love.  She was crushed by a previous relationship and now carries many scars.  She refuses to emotionally commit herself to another relationship, prefering instead to pursue short lived affairs with no attachments, although deep inside she would like to find someone, even if she won't admit it to herself.  Her life changes dramatically when a man comes up to her from out of the blue and expresses his undying love.  He is currently engaged to another woman who loves him deeply, but he is so profoundly attracted to Baye's character that he will leave her.  This may sound like some bizarre, confused love triangle, but in fact this film is extremely well done.  The pacing of the story is perfect, and the complexities of the emotions and the characters are on full display without being melodramatic in any way.  There are a few side plots in this film (Audrey Tautou's relationship with an older man), some of which enhance the story and some of which are a pointless distraction (the woman who comes to the salon to tan in the nude).  There is a realism in this film (and French films of this genre in general) that is totally lacking in comparable American films.  We can feel and sympathize with Nathalie Baye's fear and anguish about committing herself again.  This is not Baye's best performance (Le Retour de Martin Guerre), but she is still outstanding, one of the world's best actresses.  I would rate this film as 4.5 stars if I could, rounding up to 5.  If you are new to French cinema, this would be a great film to start with.  If you are a connisseur of French cinema or Nathalie Baye, this is a must have.
