But he did have a certain quality. And his ballad songs in this movie, are simple, but nice. His best Movie Feature, I believe, was a movie he wasn't even in, but his music was. (several well done ballads). The movie was called &#34;I Walk The Line&#34; 1970 with Gregory Peck, and a young Tuesday Weld...........Not to be confused with the movie &#34;Walk the Line&#34; 2005 with Joaquin Phoenix,...which was a biography of Johnny Cash's rise to fame. I resented the fact that THAT movie used Phoenix's voice for the songs and he just couldn't reach the low notes, with the mellow timber that Johnny Cash made famous.

500703,A1VV4IJ5NKLWHC,B00000FZK0,"Kendalene Markston ""Grateful Movie Locator""","[1, 1]","""The Pride of Jesse Hallam"" is about a man who cannot read, yet tries his best to get by in life (jobs, etc). At first, he is too proud and probably embarrassed to get the help he needs to learn to read. Also, he shows a bit of anger at the situation he's in at first. Finally, he realizes that it has become time for him to face up to the situation. He really does want to read (and write as well). With the help of a very kind teacher, Jesse eventually achieves his goal. At his age, and enduring embarrassing, difficult situations (along with being a prideful man), I felt that was an amazing feat...and one that would help him a lot in life. Johnny Cash not only was a special, gifted and unique musician--but my opinion is that there are few who knew of his acting talent too. I don't know of any other movies he was in. But for ""Little House on the Prairie"" fans (I'm one), there is a great episode he was in, and he co-starred with his wife, June Carter-Cash. I loved the episode, as well as this movie...and of course, his music!

Such a powerful statement on family values and being honest with each other. The movie begins where Jesse has to sell off his home in Kentucky and move to Cinccinnati so his young daughter can get the operation she needs because she has scoliosis. Then he takes his son to school, telling him to fill out the paper work because he needs to find a job. As the movie unfolds, we see Jesse giving us clues that lead up to an unfortunate condition shared by many -- he is not able to read. When his son tells him he is being dropped a grade because of his schoolwork, Jesse has it out with the assistant principal played by Brenda Vacarro who lets him know her father may have a job for him. Jesse meets her Italian father played very ably by Eli Wallach who not only hires him, but in finding out Jesse's secret, fixes him up with his daughter to teach him to read. So begins a relationship between two strong-willed people who draw the viewers into their disagreements with each other, one trying to prove he can cope with things on his own and the other determined to get him to accept help. Not forgotten are his daughter who is stuck in bed while recuperating from her operation, and his son who has a secret of his own. In the end, both come to terms with it, and work together to conquer it. Throughout the movie are terrific Johnny Cash songs including Paradise, and I'll Be A Diamond Someday.

Hallam, a miner since 14 from the Coal Fields sector of Western Kentucky in Muhlenberg County, has no choice but to leave his country home when his young daughter requires spinal surgery in the Ohio metropolis, paid with cash in advance obtained from the sale of his property after his wife's death. He pits his native intelligence and work ethic against the problem of not being able to read or write, and discovers that in order to support himself and his two children, he must become literate; scenes involving the methods used in developing his new skills are the most engrossing of the production. Brenda Vaccaro plays Marion Galucci, vice-principal of the high school that Jesse's son Ted attends, doing her best with an underwritten role as Hallam's mentor, and one must appreciate the spirited performance of veteran Eli Wallach as her father Sal, employer and sponsor of the erstwhile coal miner.
