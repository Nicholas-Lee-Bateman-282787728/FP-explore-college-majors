I gave it two stars because I really love this movie and was glad people decided to release it, no matter how lacking the release is, and it's cheap... but I advise people to, if you have it recorded or can find it online, to burn it to a disc yourself and buy a cheap case, because that's really all it is, and would cost less. I actually (with the help of my label maker) made new covers for the case&DVD with pictures from the actual movie, and quickly typed up where each chapter leads on a piece of paper to just stick in the case (like some DVDs actually come with).
