Vincent Gallo is one artist that I've always respected. he's an all around great artist. his directorial debut and one of his best performances, Buffalo '66, has become a favorite of mine since the first time I watched it. his talent does not fall short in this film either. no one can portray depression like he can i guess. but the film itself just doesn't go anywhere. the repeated theme that money and success doesn't give you happiness and that love is the answer is such an abused theme that it should be placed on the discontinued shelf somewhere. i don't understand why Vincent Gallo took the offer to act in this film. he's known for being very picky in choosing his films. this does not seem like a choice he would make. as far as Courteney Cox goes, i'm truly surprised that actors as talentless as her actually have a career when there are thousands of starving actors out there that could use roles like this. i tried watching this movie 3 times and on the 4th i finally finished it. it really couldn't hold my attention. i would not recomend this film to anyone, unless you're a Friends fan. it might appeal to your taste. but if you're watching this because Mr. Gallo is in it I would skip it and rent Palookaville instead.",2,what a ridiculous movie,1023926400,"06 13, 2002",2002,1634,"['have', 'watched', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'watching', ""'re"", 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'fan', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'fan', 'very', 'unlikely', 'like', 'whoever', 'cast', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'strong', '[', 'STUFF', ']', 'not', 'have', 'noticed', ""n't"", 'sort', 'chemistry', 'considering', 'dull', 'story', 'are', 'supossed', 'be', 'love', 'chemistry', 'important', 'fact', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'one', 'artist', ""'ve"", 'always', 'respected', 'around', 'great', 'artist', 'directorial', 'debut', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Buffalo', ""'66"", 'become', 'favorite', 'mine', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'talent', 'not', 'fall', 'short', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'portray', 'depression', 'can', 'i', 'guess', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'repeated', 'theme', 'money', 'success', ""n't"", 'give', 'happiness', 'love', 'answer', 'such', 'abused', 'theme', 'should', 'be', 'placed', 'discontinued', 'shelf', 'somewhere', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'took', 'offer', 'act', 'film', 'known', 'being', 'very', 'picky', 'choosing', 'films', 'not', 'seem', 'choice', 'would', 'make', 'as', 'far', 'Courteney', 'Cox', 'i', ""'m"", 'truly', 'surprised', 'actors', 'as', 'talentless', 'actually', 'have', 'career', 'when', 'are', 'thousands', 'starving', 'actors', 'could', 'use', 'roles', 'i', 'tried', 'watching', 'movie', '3', 'times', '4th', 'i', 'finally', 'finished', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'hold', 'attention', 'i', 'would', 'not', 'recomend', 'film', 'anyone', ""'re"", 'Friends', 'fan', 'might', 'appeal', 'taste', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Mr.', 'Gallo', 'would', 'skip', 'rent', 'Palookaville', 'instead']",N/A
699473,A1CN2WMP1YH95J,B0000648YZ,Jameson Rachen,"[2, 7]","Quite a strange take on the hopeless romantic comedy, especially considering Courtney Cox is the female lead.  But instead of the tasteless and mindless tripe you would expect from such an actress, this is intelligent, dark and a little rough around the edges.  OK, it's hard to believe that Courtney Cox would ever fall in love with Vincent Gallo (especially his character here).  He's an unkempt, bitter, psychotic, uncontrollable TV host (he blatantly asks a supermodel about her [love] life on television), not a character you would find roaming around the Friend's set.  I could just imagine the harassment he would receive from Joey, Chandler, Ross, Rachel and especially Monica (I think he and Phoebe would get along just fine), let alone if one of the Friends tried dating him.  Gallo was a bit overdramatic at times, which isn't all that unusual for him, and considering he is always present on the screen (both as an actor and soundtrack composer) it becomes distracting.  The other characters make up for this, especially Courtney Cox, whom I have gained a lot of respect for after Get Well Soon.  And I always enjoy Elina Lowensohn (Nadja) who plays Courtney Cox's best friend.",4,courtney cox and vincent gallo?  in love?,1053388800,"05 20, 2003",2003,1189,"['strange', 'take', 'hopeless', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'especially', 'considering', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'female', 'lead', 'instead', 'tasteless', 'mindless', 'tripe', 'would', 'expect', 'such', 'actress', 'intelligent', 'dark', 'little', 'rough', 'edges', 'OK', 'hard', 'believe', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'would', 'ever', 'fall', 'love', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'especially', 'character', 'here', 'unkempt', 'bitter', 'psychotic', 'uncontrollable', 'TV', 'host', 'blatantly', 'supermodel', '[', 'love', ']', 'life', 'television', 'not', 'character', 'would', 'find', 'roaming', 'Friend', 'set', 'could', 'just', 'imagine', 'harassment', 'would', 'receive', 'Joey', 'Chandler', 'Ross', 'Rachel', 'especially', 'Monica', 'think', 'Phoebe', 'would', 'get', 'along', 'just', 'fine', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'Friends', 'tried', 'dating', 'Gallo', 'was', 'bit', 'overdramatic', 'times', ""n't"", 'unusual', 'considering', 'always', 'present', 'screen', 'actor', 'soundtrack', 'composer', 'distracting', 'other', 'characters', 'make', 'up', 'especially', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'whom', 'have', 'gained', 'lot', 'respect', 'Get', 'Well', 'Soon', 'always', 'enjoy', 'Elina', 'Lowensohn', 'Nadja', 'who', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'best', 'friend']",N/A

How did the producer guy know the dog was in the asylum is the main question, it's just not explained at all.

699475,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000648YZ,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 4]","A little-seen film starring Vincent Gallo and Courteney Cox, directed by Justin McCarthy (brother of actor Andrew of 'Less Than Zero'), released from marverick indie company Lions Gate, which also released quite impressive 'Bufallo 66' directed Gallo.But this film is a disappointment.  I like Gallo, and watched almost all of his films (including notorious 'Brown Bunny'), but 'Get Well Soon' suffers from too many things.First, this is about the popular midnight TV personality Bobby, played by Vincent Gallo.  Sorry, but I don't believe it.  Gallo looks never the kind of the character he plays here, because Gallo's talent (as musician, film director, whatever you pick) is not to be found in mainstream media like TV.  He is not Letterman or Leno, and that's his strength, isn't it?And Bobby comes back to his town, where his ex-girlfriend Lilly lives, and Bobby tried to make up for the past wrongs done to her, with a help from her brother who is now in a mental institute.  This quirky romantic comedy follows the process of love between them, with some episodes about the immates of the instutite, who tries to steal a dog of Matthew Broderick (who does NOT appear).Lilly is played by Courteney Cox, whom I love to see in any films, but somehow she lacks the charms she showed in other films of his.  The biggest problem is still Gallo, whose dangerous charisma was sensational in '66' or 'Palookaville,' but not here, only looking like sleepwalking.  Sorry his fans, but he is totally miscast.Perhaps more damaging is the director's poor direction.  The characters are annoyingly unfunny, trying to be funny, and the jokes are as fresh as last years's news, recycling those jokes about gays or mental institute.  For die-hard Gallo fans only; others, skip it.",2,Weak and Unfunny Romantic Comedy Starring Gallo and Cox,1093219200,"08 23, 2004",2004,1769,"['little-seen', 'film', 'starring', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'Courteney', 'Cox', 'directed', 'Justin', 'McCarthy', 'brother', 'actor', 'Andrew', ""'Less"", 'Than', 'Zero', 'released', 'marverick', 'indie', 'company', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'also', 'released', 'quite', 'impressive', '66', 'directed', 'Gallo.But', 'film', 'disappointment', 'Gallo', 'watched', 'almost', 'films', 'including', 'notorious', ""'Brown"", 'Bunny', 'Well', 'Soon', 'suffers', 'too', 'many', 'things.First', 'popular', 'midnight', 'TV', 'personality', 'Bobby', 'played', 'Vincent', 'Gallo', 'Sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Gallo', 'never', 'kind', 'character', 'here', 'Gallo', 'talent', 'musician', 'film', 'director', 'pick', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'mainstream', 'media', 'TV', 'not', 'Letterman', 'Leno', 'strength', ""n't"", 'Bobby', 'back', 'town', 'where', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Lilly', 'Bobby', 'tried', 'make', 'up', 'past', 'wrongs', 'done', 'help', 'brother', 'who', 'now', 'mental', 'institute', 'quirky', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'process', 'love', 'episodes', 'immates', 'instutite', 'who', 'steal', 'dog', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'who', 'NOT', 'appear', '.Lilly', 'played', 'Courteney', 'Cox', 'whom', 'love', 'see', 'films', 'somehow', 'charms', 'showed', 'other', 'films', 'biggest', 'problem', 'still', 'Gallo', 'dangerous', 'charisma', 'was', 'sensational', ""'66"", ""'Palookaville"", 'not', 'here', 'only', 'looking', 'sleepwalking', 'Sorry', 'fans', 'totally', 'miscast.Perhaps', 'more', 'damaging', 'director', 'poor', 'direction', 'characters', 'are', 'annoyingly', 'unfunny', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'jokes', 'are', 'as', 'fresh', 'last', 'years', 'news', 'recycling', 'jokes', 'gays', 'mental', 'institute', 'die-hard', 'Gallo', 'fans', 'only', 'others', 'skip']",N/A
