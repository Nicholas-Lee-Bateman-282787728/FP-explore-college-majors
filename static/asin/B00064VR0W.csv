860749,A1534MBU6VJXYN,B00064VR0W,"Anthony Nasti ""Tony""","[22, 23]","Rod Stewart has been a consistently amazing live performer since the 1970s', but this concert at the Royal Albert Hall may be the single greatest performance of his career. Never have I seen such a consistently entertaining live dvd, with great sound and camera work to boot.Featuring 17 breathtaking Rod classics, this dvd never fails to deliver. Whether he's wailing his way through to ""Stay With Me"", pouring his heart into ""You're In My Heart"", crooning out the timeless ""American Songbook"" tracks or showing his tender side on ""I Don't Wanna Talk About It"" (sung with a brand new singing talent discocvered by Rod, Amy Belle).The whole dvd is a highlight as a whole, but forced to pick one performance as the dvd's high point, I would have to go for ""Hot Legs"". Rod just rocks the hell out of this one, proving that even at 60 he still hasn't lost his youthful energy. My only wish is that he performed ""Some Guys Have All The Luck"" and ""Addicted To Love"" separately. They're great as a medley, but I feel they'd work even better on their own.Overall, a stunning live performance that only a performer like Rod can provide. My advice is to go out and buy this amazing dvd.",5,A Wonderful Performance,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,1177,"['Rod', 'Stewart', 'been', 'consistently', 'amazing', 'live', 'performer', '1970s', 'concert', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'may', 'be', 'single', 'greatest', 'performance', 'career', 'have', 'seen', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'live', 'dvd', 'great', 'sound', 'camera', 'work', 'boot.Featuring', '17', 'breathtaking', 'Rod', 'classics', 'dvd', 'never', 'deliver', 'wailing', 'way', 'Stay', 'Me', 'pouring', 'heart', ""'re"", 'My', 'Heart', 'crooning', 'out', 'timeless', 'American', 'Songbook', 'tracks', 'showing', 'tender', 'side', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Wan', 'na', 'Talk', 'sung', 'brand', 'new', 'singing', 'talent', 'discocvered', 'Rod', 'Amy', 'Belle', '.The', 'whole', 'dvd', 'highlight', 'whole', 'forced', 'pick', 'one', 'performance', 'dvd', 'high', 'point', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'Hot', 'Legs', 'Rod', 'just', 'hell', 'one', 'proving', 'even', '60', 'still', ""n't"", 'lost', 'youthful', 'energy', 'only', 'wish', 'performed', 'Guys', 'Have', 'Luck', 'Addicted', 'Love', 'separately', ""'re"", 'great', 'medley', 'feel', ""'d"", 'work', 'even', 'better', 'own.Overall', 'stunning', 'live', 'performance', 'only', 'performer', 'Rod', 'can', 'provide', 'My', 'advice', 'go', 'out', 'buy', 'amazing', 'dvd']",One Night Only - Rod Stewart Live at Royal Albert Hall

860753,AVZUVRF7MFS24,B00064VR0W,David S. Jenkins,"[108, 110]","Others have described the details of the show so I won't bore you except to say that if you're a Rod fan, especially one like me who's loved his work for (groan) over 35 years, I'll just say that... THIS ONE'S GONNA FLOOR YA. Just a fabulous performance (and for once, consistently great camerawork and great editing.) But I do want to tell you about one song, one very special moment. As we know, late one night a thousand years ago Long John Baldry discovered Rod as he was singing in a lonely train station, and took him under his wing. Rod's returned the favour big time. Imagine if you will being a very young woman busking on the streets of Glasgow... and one week later descending a beautifully lit grand staircase to the stage of the Royal Albert Hall to sing ""I Don't Wanna Talk About It"" on live national TV with Rod Stewart. God, how this girl keeps it together is beyond me, but she does, she in fact KILLS. It's an exquisitely beautiful, deeply moving, very human moment. A great moment of artistic generosity on Rod's part, and a lump-in-the-throat moment for the viewer as Amy Belle experiences what must have been the peak moment of her life. It's unforgettable, and there wasn't a dry eye in this house I can promise you. Oh, and any Rod fan who's hesitant about this American Songbook stuff, not to worry, his performance of these old chestnuts is fabulous, as though they'd been written for him or by him. And the final number, ""Sailing,"" is a knockout. I think this DVD simply backs up what I've always maintained, which is that Rod is the greatest solo act of our generation. Rod, if you're reading this, a million thanks for all the pleasure over five decades, all the unforgettable shows, from a little kid from the Boston Tea Party...",5,Lots of Heart,1108512000,"02 16, 2005",2005,1758,"['Others', 'have', 'described', 'details', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'say', ""'re"", 'Rod', 'fan', 'especially', 'one', 'who', 'loved', 'work', 'groan', '35', 'years', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'THIS', 'ONE', 'GON', 'NA', 'FLOOR', 'YA', 'Just', 'fabulous', 'performance', 'once', 'consistently', 'great', 'camerawork', 'great', 'editing', 'do', 'want', 'tell', 'one', 'song', 'one', 'very', 'special', 'moment', 'know', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'thousand', 'years', 'ago', 'Long', 'John', 'Baldry', 'discovered', 'Rod', 'was', 'singing', 'lonely', 'train', 'station', 'took', 'wing', 'Rod', 'returned', 'favour', 'big', 'time', 'Imagine', 'will', 'being', 'very', 'young', 'woman', 'busking', 'streets', 'Glasgow', 'one', 'week', 'later', 'descending', 'beautifully', 'lit', 'grand', 'staircase', 'stage', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'sing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Wan', 'na', 'Talk', 'live', 'national', 'TV', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'God', 'how', 'together', 'fact', 'KILLS', 'exquisitely', 'beautiful', 'deeply', 'moving', 'very', 'human', 'moment', 'great', 'moment', 'artistic', 'generosity', 'Rod', 'part', 'lump-in-the-throat', 'moment', 'viewer', 'Amy', 'Belle', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'peak', 'moment', 'life', 'unforgettable', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'dry', 'eye', 'house', 'can', 'promise', 'Oh', 'Rod', 'fan', 'who', 'hesitant', 'American', 'Songbook', 'stuff', 'not', 'worry', 'performance', 'old', 'chestnuts', 'fabulous', ""'d"", 'been', 'written', 'final', 'number', 'Sailing', 'knockout', 'think', 'DVD', 'simply', 'up', 'what', ""'ve"", 'always', 'maintained', 'Rod', 'greatest', 'solo', 'act', 'generation', 'Rod', ""'re"", 'reading', 'million', 'thanks', 'pleasure', 'five', 'decades', 'unforgettable', 'shows', 'little', 'kid', 'Boston', 'Tea', 'Party']",One Night Only - Rod Stewart Live at Royal Albert Hall

860759,A1D44YT0P8Q8XL,B00064VR0W,Rebecca*rhapsodyinblue*,"[5, 7]","Rod Stewart's ""One Night Only: Live At The Royal Albert Hall"" is one fabulous and remarkable concert. Imagine a venue that caters to famous and legendary singers, one of them was an icon of a singer Frank Sinatra. This stunning concert is a showcase of Rod Stewart's big hits as ROD THE MOD, and his bestselling Great American Songbook series as ROD THE FAB (the title I coined - short for fabulous interpreter of the Great American Songbook). He describes his GAS: Volume I as ""an album that calms you down."" He added that recording it was a great challenge and he was so thrilled with the outcome. According to him, ""it's so impossible for him to run out of these songs from the Great American Songbook."" He further states that he ""could probably make six albums of these songs quite easily."" He already made four volumes, which are all bestsellers. I only hope that there would be an upcoming Volume V. It's a common knowledge that he truly enjoyed this experience so much and understands how much it means to him and to his fans as well. And he also wants it to always remain something special. The Songbook albums have meant a great deal to him and thinks that singing these songs has made him a better singer one can only hope.I must admit that I only became a fan of Rod the Fab when he recorded the standards from the Great American Songbook, though there were occasional hits he sung that really appeal to me like ""Reason To Believe,"" ""I Don't Want To Talk About It"" and ""You're In My Heart."" I've watched one of his earliest television interviews with Katie Couric while promoting his GAS series. Ms. Couric asked him why he ""doesn't look his age."" I guess he was sixty then, and he declared that some of his ""secrets of looking young are . . . lots of music, wine and soccer.""His performances are in every way sparkling and dazzling as the brightest evening star, and so electrifying as lightning! He has the backing of a large orchestra and well-rehearsed musicians to make this concert the greatest gig of the year! He shares some interesting anecdotes, one of which is about his first guitar. His Dad gave him a guitar for no apparent reason and told him: ""Why don't you take this up, there's money in this."" And the rest, of course, is history.While I'm thoroughly delighted with the concert in its entirety, my favorite parts are all his performances on the Great American Songbook. On these presentations, the London-born singer looking so dapper in his pinstriped outfit brings new life to these chestnuts with his excellent showmanship and his fabulous stage presence.My highlights:""They Can't Take That Away From Me"" - beautiful sax solo by Katja.""Blue Moon"" - the guitar solo is absolutely breathtaking!""As Time Goes By"" - an amazing duet with Chrissie Hynde with exquisite solos on violin by Janet and sax by Katja.""For Sentimental Reasons"" - a lovely performance.""Reason To Believe"" - one of the most notable performances.""I Don't Want To Talk About It"" - a duet with Amy Belle who has a very expressive voice.There's no doubt that Rod Stewart is such a total performer and he could command your undivided attention whether you're listening to his CDs or watching his DVDs such as this one.What a fabulous concert!",5,What A Fabulous Concert!,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,3237,"['Rod', 'Stewart', 'One', 'Night', 'Only', 'Live', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'one', 'fabulous', 'remarkable', 'concert', 'Imagine', 'venue', 'caters', 'famous', 'legendary', 'singers', 'one', 'was', 'icon', 'singer', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'stunning', 'concert', 'showcase', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'big', 'hits', 'ROD', 'THE', 'MOD', 'bestselling', 'Great', 'American', 'Songbook', 'series', 'ROD', 'THE', 'FAB', 'title', 'coined', 'short', 'fabulous', 'interpreter', 'Great', 'American', 'Songbook', 'GAS', 'Volume', 'album', 'down', 'added', 'recording', 'was', 'great', 'challenge', 'was', 'so', 'thrilled', 'outcome', 'According', 'so', 'impossible', 'run', 'out', 'songs', 'Great', 'American', 'Songbook', 'states', 'could', 'probably', 'make', 'six', 'albums', 'songs', 'quite', 'easily', 'already', 'made', 'four', 'volumes', 'are', 'bestsellers', 'only', 'hope', 'would', 'be', 'upcoming', 'Volume', 'V.', 'common', 'knowledge', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'experience', 'so', 'much', 'how', 'much', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'always', 'remain', 'something', 'special', 'Songbook', 'albums', 'have', 'meant', 'great', 'deal', 'singing', 'songs', 'made', 'better', 'singer', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'hope.I', 'must', 'admit', 'only', 'became', 'fan', 'Rod', 'Fab', 'when', 'recorded', 'standards', 'Great', 'American', 'Songbook', 'were', 'occasional', 'hits', 'sung', 'really', 'appeal', 'Reason', 'Believe', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Want', 'Talk', ""'re"", 'My', 'Heart', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'one', 'earliest', 'television', 'interviews', 'Katie', 'Couric', 'promoting', 'GAS', 'series', 'Ms.', 'Couric', 'asked', 'why', ""n't"", 'look', 'age', 'guess', 'was', 'sixty', 'then', 'declared', 'secrets', 'looking', 'young', 'are', 'lots', 'music', 'wine', 'soccer', 'performances', 'are', 'way', 'sparkling', 'dazzling', 'brightest', 'evening', 'star', 'so', 'electrifying', 'lightning', 'backing', 'large', 'orchestra', 'well-rehearsed', 'musicians', 'make', 'concert', 'greatest', 'gig', 'year', 'shares', 'interesting', 'anecdotes', 'one', 'first', 'guitar', 'Dad', 'gave', 'guitar', 'apparent', 'reason', 'told', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'up', 'money', 'rest', 'course', 'history.While', ""'m"", 'thoroughly', 'delighted', 'concert', 'entirety', 'favorite', 'parts', 'are', 'performances', 'Great', 'American', 'Songbook', 'presentations', 'London-born', 'singer', 'looking', 'so', 'dapper', 'pinstriped', 'outfit', 'new', 'life', 'chestnuts', 'excellent', 'showmanship', 'fabulous', 'stage', 'presence.My', 'highlights', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Take', 'Away', 'Me', 'beautiful', 'sax', 'solo', 'Katja', 'Blue', 'Moon', 'guitar', 'solo', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'Time', 'Goes', 'amazing', 'duet', 'Chrissie', 'Hynde', 'exquisite', 'solos', 'violin', 'Janet', 'sax', 'Katja', 'Sentimental', 'Reasons', 'lovely', 'performance', 'Reason', 'Believe', 'one', 'most', 'notable', 'performances', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Want', 'Talk', 'duet', 'Amy', 'Belle', 'who', 'very', 'expressive', 'voice.There', 'doubt', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'such', 'total', 'performer', 'could', 'command', 'undivided', 'attention', ""'re"", 'listening', 'CDs', 'watching', 'DVDs', 'such', 'fabulous', 'concert']",One Night Only - Rod Stewart Live at Royal Albert Hall

860763,A2XBIA6885LVFT,B00064VR0W,"Shaun Tatarka ""rodstewartblogcom""","[34, 44]","There is a moment in this DVD, during ""Reason to Believe"" when Rod Stewart takes the mic and growls ""Knowing that you lied--straight faced while I cried!""  What make it special is that the singer uses that great death howl that you can feel right in your very soul. It is what has made Rod Stewart a huge star and one of many things that has made him a tremendously exciting live performer. The problem is, that after his throat surgery four years ago, that growl is rarely heard in concert anymore. Ever since the surgery, Rod sings all uptempo numbers from Maggie to Hot Legs as if he's afraid to cut loose, like he may do further damage to the pipes. He still has it --you can hear it on certain numbers but more often than not, Stewart has adopted a ""wimpy"" style of singing that disappoints those of us who remember the pre-surgery live Rod. One does not notice it on the ballads as much (though some of them sound weak as well when he wimps out.) so he can still get away with the Great American Songbook.However, that major complaint aside, those of us who have made ROD STEWART a second religon, are willing to forgive the old boy almost anything--after all, he's entertained us so long and so well, how could we not?-- and the Stewart charm is so prevelant throughout this concert, that it's STILL enjoyable. It's almost like ROD STEWART ON ICE--A CELEBRATION of a career, not quite a rock concert in the sense of what Rod could do just five or six years ago, but still a rock-like spectacle produced by a lovable rogue who has survived so much that I would imagine anyone willing to give Rod the benefit of the doubt, will give into the irrepressible wit and charisma and enjoy this show. ALSO--Rod has once again, as he has for the past 20 years or so, surrounded himself with fantastic musicians--and all of them are showcased here. They are not the Faces of course, but they aren't meant to be.  (Plus you get to see his current way-too-young-for-him blonde--Penny Lancaster--prance around in a Scottish plaid mini skirt, threatening to play the bagpipes. At 6'1 and drop dead gorgeous, it's worth the price of the DVD alone. wink wink.)SO--Rod fans will love it, it is currently the best Rod live DVD available (much better than the bloodless, joyless Songbook DVD and more complete than the great Storytellers show) but this will not gain Rod any new converts. For that we will need a multi-disc set that chronicles Rod Stewart at his peak as a live performer, from his days with the Faces in the early 70s to 1998's great ""New Boys"" tour.",3,"""ROD STEWART"" ON ICE",1104019200,"12 26, 2004",2004,2554,"['moment', 'DVD', 'Reason', 'Believe', 'when', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'mic', 'Knowing', 'lied', 'straight', 'faced', 'cried', 'What', 'make', 'special', 'singer', 'great', 'death', 'howl', 'can', 'feel', 'right', 'very', 'soul', 'what', 'made', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'huge', 'star', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'made', 'tremendously', 'exciting', 'live', 'performer', 'problem', 'throat', 'surgery', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'growl', 'rarely', 'heard', 'concert', 'anymore', 'Ever', 'surgery', 'Rod', 'uptempo', 'numbers', 'Maggie', 'Hot', 'Legs', 'afraid', 'cut', 'loose', 'may', 'do', 'further', 'damage', 'pipes', 'still', 'can', 'hear', 'certain', 'numbers', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'Stewart', 'adopted', 'wimpy', 'style', 'singing', 'disappoints', 'who', 'remember', 'pre-surgery', 'live', 'Rod', 'One', 'not', 'notice', 'ballads', 'much', 'sound', 'weak', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'out', 'can', 'still', 'get', 'away', 'Great', 'American', 'Songbook.However', 'major', 'complaint', 'aside', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'ROD', 'STEWART', 'second', 'religon', 'are', 'willing', 'forgive', 'old', 'boy', 'almost', 'anything', 'entertained', 'so', 'long', 'so', 'well', 'how', 'could', 'not', 'Stewart', 'charm', 'so', 'prevelant', 'concert', 'STILL', 'enjoyable', 'almost', 'ROD', 'STEWART', 'ON', 'ICE', 'CELEBRATION', 'career', 'not', 'quite', 'rock', 'concert', 'sense', 'what', 'Rod', 'could', 'do', 'just', 'five', 'six', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'rock-like', 'spectacle', 'produced', 'lovable', 'rogue', 'who', 'survived', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'willing', 'give', 'Rod', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'will', 'give', 'irrepressible', 'wit', 'charisma', 'enjoy', 'show', 'ALSO', 'Rod', 'once', 'again', 'past', '20', 'years', 'so', 'surrounded', 'fantastic', 'musicians', 'are', 'showcased', 'here', 'are', 'not', 'Faces', 'course', 'are', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'get', 'see', 'current', 'way-too-young-for-him', 'blonde', 'Penny', 'Lancaster', 'prance', 'around', 'Scottish', 'plaid', 'mini', 'skirt', 'threatening', 'play', 'bagpipes', '6', '1', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'price', 'DVD', 'alone', 'wink', 'wink', 'SO', 'Rod', 'fans', 'will', 'love', 'currently', 'best', 'Rod', 'live', 'DVD', 'available', 'much', 'better', 'bloodless', 'joyless', 'Songbook', 'DVD', 'more', 'complete', 'great', 'Storytellers', 'show', 'will', 'not', 'gain', 'Rod', 'new', 'converts', 'will', 'need', 'multi-disc', 'set', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'peak', 'live', 'performer', 'days', 'Faces', 'early', '70s', '1998', 'great', 'New', 'Boys', 'tour']",One Night Only - Rod Stewart Live at Royal Albert Hall

There are 12 classics (including ""Stay with me"" with Ronnie Wood) and 5 standards from ""American songbook"" trilogy (""As Times Goes by"" performed with Chrissie Hynde of Pretenders). All in all, it's a wonderful DVD - great show and excellent quality of audio and video. At 59 Rod is still a great entertainer, and his backing musicians are very good. The audience is just fantastic and is ready to sing along with Rod all the time (sometimes he even has to tell that they can not start to sing before him).One of the best live DVDs I've ever seen.
