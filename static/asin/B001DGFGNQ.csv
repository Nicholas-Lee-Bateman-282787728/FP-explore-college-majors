1180295,A1KAUV9QYLP52J,B001DGFGNQ,Kellyannl,"[3, 3]","This second set of Emma begins with a textbook example of how to do a recap episode, as Vivian's reading of Romeo and Juliet prompts Hakim to coyly recount to the audience what's happened so far in the grand fashion of a Shakespearean prologue.  As it ends with him proclaiming that the ""Second Act"" is about to begin, we're off with the continuing story of Emma and William.As it begins, Mrs. Stowner's sad but natural passing has left Hakim - who isn't going to be in England forever - as the only remaining champion of Emma and William's relationship.  Emma is, fortunately, not out on the streets, as she's quickly employed by mischievous, unconventional German expatriate Dorothea Molders - the woman she met at the train station at the end of the last set - who turns out to be a wonderful employer.  Meanwhile, to Hakim's disappointment and dismay, William proposes to Eleanor in an attempt to please his father and forget Emma.Of course, this is a romance, so an outrageous coincidence throws Emma and William together again and William realizes his terrible mistake.  But by that time Emma has started spending time with Mrs. Molders' gruff but kind handyman Hans, with whom she has alot in common - and if William humiliates Eleanor and the Campbell family by breaking the engagement at a late stage, it might ruin his father's business, his brothers' employment prospects, and his sisters' marriage prospects all in one shot, in addition to profoundly hurting Eleanor, who he doesn't love but considers a friend...Can William convince Emma that they can defy convention, as well as convince his family that she is worth the financial downsizing they might all face if he leaves Eleanor for Emma?The answer is no surprise, pretty much given away in the new opening sequence and by the fact that Hakim's one-episode prologue is delivered in a fairly light tone in spite of the Romeo and Juliet springboard.  It's the execution of the story that's so wonderful.  The new cast members are engaging, and the scenery of the Molders' country estate expands the Victorian world largely limited to the stunning depiction of London in the first set.Ultimately, Emma ranks at the highest level of slice of life anime, and is a must for the collection of any fans of that subgenre - as well as period piece fans or even anyone who simply wants a change from the action/adventure genre of most anime.",5,The end of a traditional tale,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,2398,"['second', 'set', 'Emma', 'textbook', 'example', 'how', 'do', 'recap', 'episode', 'Vivian', 'reading', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'prompts', 'Hakim', 'coyly', 'recount', 'audience', 'what', 'happened', 'so', 'far', 'grand', 'fashion', 'Shakespearean', 'prologue', 'proclaiming', 'Second', 'Act', 'begin', ""'re"", 'off', 'continuing', 'story', 'Emma', 'William.As', 'Mrs.', 'Stowner', 'sad', 'natural', 'passing', 'left', 'Hakim', 'who', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'England', 'forever', 'only', 'remaining', 'champion', 'Emma', 'William', 'relationship', 'Emma', 'fortunately', 'not', 'streets', 'quickly', 'employed', 'mischievous', 'unconventional', 'German', 'expatriate', 'Dorothea', 'Molders', 'woman', 'met', 'train', 'station', 'end', 'last', 'set', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'wonderful', 'employer', 'Meanwhile', 'Hakim', 'disappointment', 'dismay', 'William', 'Eleanor', 'attempt', 'please', 'father', 'forget', 'Emma.Of', 'course', 'romance', 'outrageous', 'coincidence', 'throws', 'Emma', 'William', 'together', 'again', 'William', 'terrible', 'mistake', 'time', 'Emma', 'started', 'spending', 'time', 'Mrs.', 'Molders', 'gruff', 'kind', 'handyman', 'Hans', 'whom', 'alot', 'common', 'William', 'Eleanor', 'Campbell', 'family', 'breaking', 'engagement', 'late', 'stage', 'might', 'ruin', 'father', 'business', 'brothers', 'employment', 'prospects', 'sisters', 'marriage', 'prospects', 'one', 'shot', 'addition', 'profoundly', 'hurting', 'Eleanor', 'who', ""n't"", 'love', 'friend', 'Can', 'William', 'convince', 'Emma', 'can', 'defy', 'convention', 'as', 'well', 'convince', 'family', 'financial', 'downsizing', 'might', 'face', 'Eleanor', 'Emma', 'answer', 'surprise', 'pretty', 'much', 'given', 'away', 'new', 'opening', 'sequence', 'fact', 'Hakim', 'one-episode', 'prologue', 'delivered', 'fairly', 'light', 'tone', 'spite', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'springboard', 'execution', 'story', 'so', 'wonderful', 'new', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'engaging', 'scenery', 'Molders', 'country', 'estate', 'Victorian', 'world', 'largely', 'limited', 'stunning', 'depiction', 'London', 'first', 'set.Ultimately', 'Emma', 'highest', 'level', 'slice', 'life', 'anime', 'must', 'collection', 'fans', 'subgenre', 'as', 'well', 'period', 'piece', 'fans', 'even', 'anyone', 'who', 'simply', 'change', 'action/adventure', 'genre', 'most', 'anime']",Emma: A Victorian Romance - Season 2

Bryant ""Webmaster of OtakuReview.net""","[0, 0]","Touching on many levels, the second season of Emma manages to do everything that the first season couldn't plus much more. It's rare that you come across a series that gets off to such a poor start before managing to tell such a beautiful second half but this one certainly fits that mold. If you are ever looking for a moving, touching and sometimes heartbreaking period romance than you needn't look any further; this is romantic gold.",5,Wow!,1230336000,"12 27, 2008",2008,437,"['Touching', 'many', 'levels', 'second', 'season', 'Emma', 'manages', 'do', 'everything', 'first', 'season', 'could', ""n't"", 'plus', 'much', 'more', 'rare', 'come', 'series', 'off', 'such', 'poor', 'start', 'managing', 'tell', 'beautiful', 'second', 'half', 'one', 'certainly', 'mold', 'are', 'ever', 'looking', 'moving', 'touching', 'sometimes', 'heartbreaking', 'period', 'romance', 'need', ""n't"", 'look', 'further', 'romantic', 'gold']",Emma: A Victorian Romance - Season 2

It felt much more grand than its subdued classy first season.In season 2 of Emma, our main character moves away from London to get away from the struggle of her affair with a noble and begins life as a maid in Germany where her first day is met with an accusation of theft. Things lead to an emotional but very happy ending and Emma finds herself a favorite among the maids and the masters of the house. Emma's love, Will, back in London can not get her out of his mind and falls into depression but finds comfort in Miss Campbell, a sweet noble girl. The two begin to fall in love. Things seem to go smoothly until Emma and Will's lives cross paths again and the story takes a dramatic turn.Nozomi's release comes with perfect subtitles and a great set of extras.

1180298,A3NIQK6ZLYEP1L,B001DGFGNQ,Michael Valdivielso,"[0, 0]","In Season Two we see Emma and William living apart in two households which, when you come down to it, are both upper crust but have different views on class, money, power, and their places in the universe.  As one review pointed out this is a very subtle and quiet anime and many people may not enjoy it or even watch it because it just isn't their thing.  Like the first DVD set this one has a extra in the form of a book with few extras within the DVDs themselves.  It is, also, like the first DVDs subtitled.  It WOULD have been nice to hear English voices but I don't mind that much.  On the other hand, would have been nice to hear the German accent of the Molders maybe?Like the first series the plot is realistic and the characters very solid, very aware of their place.  They are characters of their time and don't pretend to have 21st Century values in a 19th Century world.  And I still want to kick William in the butt - he is such a good character that he REALLY generates a emotional response from me.  Mostly the need to smack him around.And the character of Monica felt off.  The Campbell family came off as so proper and aware of their image...yet they allow the oldest girl to dress and act like that?!?!?  Funny thing is I was starting to feel sorry for the Campbell family till...well, that be spoilers.  I guess the Japanese needed a villain for the piece.  I think it would have been better off if they left out the Bad Guy and let the lovers have to deal with the real problem - deciding if their love was important enough to break away from their class, their culture, and their society.  Would they be strong enough to believe in themselves?  Sad to say, we will never really know.  The ending was not as realistic as I would have hoped and did leave some loose ends.  True, it suggests happy endings for all but we all know that there would be a LOT of fallout from such a ending.Enjoy with good English Black Tea (from India) and scones (from Scotland) and try to give the Maid the day off while you watch the DVDs.
