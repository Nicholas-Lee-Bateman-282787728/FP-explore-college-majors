Each time I was stopped dead in my tracks.The picture of Amy Schumer on the cover of this box doesn't do her justice.  She is so darn cute.  She is also so darn nasty and hilariously funny.  She comes out wearing this high-waisted party dress that shows off her incredibly long legs.  She's telling jokes like she's talking to just-us-girls in the audience.  But I'm sure every male's pants were bulging while she spoke.  (The guys in the front row - could probably see up her skirt.  Just kiddin'.)She is like this generation's Joan Rivers - but a hundred times sexier.  She's not yelling like Ms. Rivers would.  She's talking to us - soft and sweetly - like she's trying to seduce us at the bar.  She tells a joke about the morning-after pill - and then she asks the women in the audience, ""Who's takin' it?""  And one woman raises her hand.  Everyone laughs.  (This is mild, for her.)Like any female comedienne, Amy tells jokes about women as only another babe can say and gets away with it.  She expresses envy for those prettier than herself.  She expresses loathing for those more privileged than herself.  We laugh and cheer her on - for both.She tells jokes about sexual topics you might be even squeamish discussing with . . your doctor.  But you find yourself laughing out loud.  She even tells jokes about men but from a feminine perspective.  Gee, how did she know about that?We can't get enough.  I was so happy to find this release.  How can you ever remember a name like ""Schumer?""  If you want to see the sexiest and funniest comedienne of our time, ""Amy Schumer - Mostly Sex Stuff"" is a video I highly recommend.
