Kennedy had been shot, Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy were next, Wallace was giving out medals and pay raises to Bull Connor INC., ready also to be shot himself.But this little film is about giving up on protest of any kind; and Jason Robards' ""protest"" is  so numbingly Lilliputian compared to what was beginning to emerge in this capitalistic nightmare, that he will see as a dream of light and magic. This character is deep only at the surface; Robards' odyssey  is about trying not to find work. EDven this is bad plotting in 1965. Furthermore, welfare is after him, and they are seen as sane.They suggest that if you don't work you might not get to live,and the implications are there, and heeded to by Robards' character as anm option!The perfomance of Robards' son is so irritating, as he is forced to mouth the endless cliches about his father's need to be ""Dad,"" and finally, embrace the perfection that work offers.Only Barbara Harris survives this Fascist film through her art, specifically, her deliveries,  her asides, and her eyes, that keep blinking as she hears the leaden speeches delivered by Robards or the son or another ""hip"" character. She sort of knows this is a dead zone, a cemetery for thinkers.But looking around the USA at this time, as I did, it is not at all unbelievable that this stupid play had audiences rooting for it for years. It says so much about why we needed the 60s counter culture, and it tells us about how Viet Nam happened.  The film never stops talking about $$ and the need to dominate the impulse to live simply, without the millions. It also points to the need to profit from everyone else. And now we do, an obvious example, China.A few more items: The feminist issues are non-excistent here, there are no gay people, and yet the film wants us to see how comprehensive the positive treatment is of everyone everywhere, with a few billion omissions.Jason Robards made the great O'Neil film in 1962 with Katharine Hepburn, ""Long Day's Journey Into Night,"" tht takes place in New London, Conn at the trun of the century.

139596,A2GYX971VETQBV,0792838009,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[66, 67]","This is a great film that explores the issue of conformity in grand detail.  Through the character Murray (played by Robards), we see the life of someone who is bound and determined to remain untainted and apart from society.  This is put to the ultimate test, when his civil disobedience endangers his ability to legally take care of his nephew.  Will Murray conform with society and keep the child, or will he refuse to sell out and lose the only thing he truly values?Murray feels what all humans feel - particularly at the age when they're ready to move out on their own into the world.  He retains a childlike quality that at times delights us with witty, honest comedy.  And at other times it frustrates our logic; for we care about the child and his future.  This story closely mimics that of *Catcher in the Rye* and also follows many of the ideals laid down by Henry David Thoreau.  Murray practices all forms of civil disobedience and definitely walks to the beat of a different drummer.With witty dialogue, endearing characters, and an all-star performance by the film's lead men, *A Thousand Clowns* is a sure winner for all audiences.  The film is made all the more classic due to its handling of a subject we all can relate too:  To conform or not to conform.",5,The Drums of Conformity - Thoreau Lost in NYC,984355200,"03 12, 2001",2001,1273,"['great', 'film', 'issue', 'conformity', 'grand', 'detail', 'character', 'Murray', 'played', 'Robards', 'see', 'life', 'someone', 'who', 'bound', 'determined', 'remain', 'untainted', 'apart', 'society', 'put', 'ultimate', 'test', 'when', 'civil', 'disobedience', 'endangers', 'ability', 'legally', 'take', 'care', 'nephew', 'Will', 'Murray', 'conform', 'society', 'keep', 'child', 'will', 'refuse', 'sell', 'out', 'lose', 'only', 'thing', 'truly', 'values', 'Murray', 'what', 'humans', 'feel', 'particularly', 'age', 'when', ""'re"", 'ready', 'move', 'out', 'own', 'world', 'childlike', 'quality', 'times', 'delights', 'witty', 'honest', 'comedy', 'other', 'times', 'logic', 'care', 'child', 'future', 'story', 'closely', 'mimics', '*Catcher', 'Rye*', 'also', 'many', 'ideals', 'laid', 'down', 'Henry', 'David', 'Thoreau', 'Murray', 'practices', 'forms', 'civil', 'disobedience', 'definitely', 'walks', 'beat', 'different', 'drummer.With', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'endearing', 'characters', 'all-star', 'performance', 'film', 'lead', 'men', '*A', 'Thousand', 'Clowns*', 'sure', 'winner', 'audiences', 'film', 'made', 'more', 'classic', 'due', 'handling', 'subject', 'can', 'relate', 'too', 'conform', 'not', 'conform']",N/A

139598,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,0792838009,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[9, 9]","An intriguing film about the balance between nonconformism and one's responsibility to others.  Jason Robards stars as Murray Burns, an ascerbic, bohemian Madison Avenue dropout who spends his days romping through Central Park, visiting the Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty, seeing ships off, and generally thumbing his nose at all the 9-to-5ers who haven't also had the gumption to quit their jobs.  He's also the guardian of his twelve-year-old nephew, Nick, but sadly the child welfare authorities have gotten wind of Uncle Murray's odd ways and willful unemployment, and Robards is forced to contend with the crushing power of ""the real world.""Adapted from a stage play, this film retains much of the blocking and timing of its original incarnation, but makes fine use of New York's mid-'60s scenery to conjure the giddy solitude of Murray's outside-looking-in lifestyle.  Like many theatre pieces from this era, this grapples with Big Issues and Psychology (both with capital letters), but it does so with a light touch, more a Neil Simon-y bittersweetness than overtly angst-ridden and shouted at the top of one's lungs.  Made just before the hippies took over, this film is an obvious precursor to ""Harold And Maude"" and the like... On the surface, the issues aren't terribly subtle, but they are handled deftly and echo well; the film retains an admirable sense of uneasiness and ambiguity even up through its seemingly neat-package ending.  Barbara Harris is good in the role of Murray's anguished girlfriend, and teen actor Barry Gordon is a marvel as the precocious nephew, Nick, giving as good as he gets, playing opposite Robards.  (Gordon later moved into bit television roles and voiceover work; a pity, since he's fascinating here, in a more serious role...)An interesting movie, exploring dilemmas and choices  that are still present today.",4,+1/2 - Before the hippies... there was Murray,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,1868,"['intriguing', 'film', 'balance', 'nonconformism', 'one', 'responsibility', 'others', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Murray', 'Burns', 'ascerbic', 'bohemian', 'Madison', 'Avenue', 'dropout', 'who', 'days', 'romping', 'Central', 'Park', 'visiting', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', 'Statue', 'Liberty', 'seeing', 'ships', 'generally', 'thumbing', 'nose', '9-to-5ers', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'also', 'had', 'gumption', 'quit', 'jobs', 'also', 'guardian', 'twelve-year-old', 'nephew', 'Nick', 'sadly', 'child', 'welfare', 'authorities', 'have', 'gotten', 'wind', 'Uncle', 'Murray', 'odd', 'ways', 'willful', 'unemployment', 'Robards', 'forced', 'contend', 'crushing', 'power', 'real', 'world', 'Adapted', 'stage', 'play', 'film', 'much', 'blocking', 'timing', 'original', 'incarnation', 'fine', 'use', 'New', 'York', ""mid-'60s"", 'scenery', 'conjure', 'giddy', 'solitude', 'Murray', 'outside-looking-in', 'lifestyle', 'many', 'theatre', 'pieces', 'era', 'grapples', 'Big', 'Issues', 'Psychology', 'capital', 'letters', 'so', 'light', 'touch', 'more', 'Neil', 'Simon-y', 'bittersweetness', 'overtly', 'angst-ridden', 'shouted', 'top', 'one', 'lungs', 'Made', 'just', 'hippies', 'took', 'over', 'film', 'obvious', 'precursor', 'Harold', 'Maude', 'like', 'surface', 'issues', 'are', ""n't"", 'terribly', 'subtle', 'are', 'handled', 'deftly', 'echo', 'well', 'film', 'admirable', 'sense', 'uneasiness', 'ambiguity', 'even', 'up', 'seemingly', 'neat-package', 'ending', 'Barbara', 'Harris', 'good', 'role', 'Murray', 'anguished', 'girlfriend', 'teen', 'actor', 'Barry', 'Gordon', 'marvel', 'precocious', 'nephew', 'Nick', 'giving', 'as', 'good', 'playing', 'opposite', 'Robards', 'Gordon', 'later', 'moved', 'bit', 'television', 'roles', 'voiceover', 'work', 'pity', 'fascinating', 'here', 'more', 'serious', 'role', 'interesting', 'movie', 'exploring', 'dilemmas', 'choices', 'are', 'still', 'present', 'today']",N/A
139599,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,0792838009,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[8, 8]","Murray Burns liked to holler -as did Jason Robards, who could bray and bellow with the best of them; like Burton and O'Toole. When Robards yelled at empty streets, shaded stoops and windows, and an indifferent sky midst the metropolis, we could hear a uniquely American timbre. He was used to emoting those magnificently tragic lines from his Broadway roles in Eugene O'Neills THE ICEMAN COMETH, MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN, and LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT. Robards was an original, who could lace his deep voice with pain, anger, and anguish as well as devilishness, sarcasm, and joy in equal measure. On top of being one of this country's best dramatic actors, the man could do comedy. As Murray Burns he played the true non-conformist, a recent drop-out from the ""rat race"" -long before Timothy Leary urged most of us to do so.One day on the subway, while on his way to work as a script-writer for kiddy show host, ""Chuckles the Chipmunk"" -suddenly Murray could not remember what day it was, finding himself leaden-eyed and dead from the neck up. He promptly quit his job, and actively ""owned each day"" since then. He became a collector of useless knick-knacks, eagle symbols and statues (""A man never can own too many eagles"") , a kite flyer, a cyclist, an unpaid tourist guide and recreation director for the masses, and a creator of holidays that no one else has ever heard of (Irving Feldman's Birthday) -a luxuriant loafer, a malcontent, wholly miscreant and yet still a philosopher -a boorish clown who would brook no insult from anyone, standing tall and ready to ""tell off""  the minions of morons, and the gaggle of bosses, constabulary, and ingrates that peopled NYC.This extended period of unemployment began to baffle Nick, the live-in nephew who had been ""dropped off"" by his mother seven years earlier. Nick was very intelligent, a student enrolled in a school for the gifted, whose administrators had begun to realize that his ""home environment was unorthodox"". The school dispatched a duo of social workers from CPS to ferret out the truth. They found Nick and Murray living in a messy one-room bachelor apartment. They found Murray unrepentant and more ready to crack wise than to fully comprehend or appreciate the trouble he was in, and they found his present state of unemployment ""unacceptable"". Somehow in the midst of the interview, Murray charmed the young female psychologist, Sandra, who quit her job and decided to try and help the pair.The Broadway play by Herb Gardner, a modest success, was adapted for the screen by Gardner, and the dialogue remained essentially intact. Fred Coe, who had directed the play, took over as producer and director of this film. He added several outdoor scenes to add texture and flavor to the urban story, but his strange choice of military marching music and 1920's ballads diminished the effectiveness of his ""opening up"" of the tale. Barry Gordon, who had been in the play with Robards, reprised his role as Nick; leaving intact his intelligence and sensitivity, his adolescent wisdom and charm. Gene Saks, a tick-ridden comedic actor also reprised his role from Broadway, playing Leo Herman -our man in chipmunk's ears. His twitchy rapid-fire delivery brought to mind both burlesque and Gene Wilder. A young Barbara Harris played Sandra, filling in for Sandy Dennis who had done the play. Her perkiness punctuated by constant weeping and vacuous vulnerability was quite a challenge -and she was more than up for it. Martin Balsam played Arnold, Murray's brother and business agent -earning a much deserved Oscar for his supporting role. His ""I have a gift for surrender."" Speech was inspired.Like countless Neil Simon plays that have been adapted for the screen, A THOUSAND CLOWNS (1965), never really lost its ""stagy""  quality -and yet for most of us, to watch a good comedic play is always a treat, worth its weight in pastrami sandwiches. This film is clever, never pedantic, heart-warming, humorous yet not quite hilarious, and joyful. It was a welcome departure for Robards, who had specialized in tragic roles. His Murray was a man who came face to face with love and reality, who discovered that his feeling for others had to transcend his own depression and selfishness -that somehow he needed to suck it up and take a distasteful job for a man he did not respect to salve the wrong, the problems that had occurred secondary to his non-conformity, his one-man assault on the system -that his actions had cost those he loved much too high a price. A thousand cheers for Murray, and welcome to our world.",4,Raising Hell,1191974400,"10 10, 2007",2007,4575,"['Murray', 'Burns', 'liked', 'holler', '-as', 'did', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'who', 'could',

How could a movie this great be relegated to the likes dusty VHS bins??The plot centers mainly around 3 people, Murry Burns (Jason Robards), an out-of-work TV writer who was sick of working for chumps; his precocious 12 year old, quasi-adopted nephew, Nick; and Sandra (Barbara Harris) a child welfare psychologist who chances her way into their lives. The script is sharp and ahead of it's time (preceding the counter culture explosion in American film by a couple of years) and the actors make every line of dialogue sing with heart and humor.The themes of bucking conformity are still relevant today, and rarely couched in so much humor and grace. The filmmakers really allowed all the issues to have untidy grays rather than merely beating us over the heads with the black and white of it all.Another thing I loved was how layered even the smaller characters where. Murry's brother Arnold (Martin Balsam), his former employer Leo AKA ""Chuckles the Chipmunk"" (Gene Saks), and social worker Albert (William Daniels), all have killer scenes where their characters (and the actors playing them) get to shine and show the doubts, conflicts and humanity in roles that could have easily been white-washed to bolster our protagonist's case.As a viewer a generation removed from the films original audience, I was blown away by how fresh, funny and affecting this movie still is today.

One of those strange films that you wonder why is not on DVD, but almost everything bad (not saying much)with Charles Bronson is.I need to tell everyone of the first time I saw the film.  I was 12 yearsold.  It was a Saturday night. I used to take the TV into the bathroom and watch whatever was on NBC's ""Saturday Night at the Movies"", while I lay in the bathtub.  This film came on that I had no idea whatever what it was.  The more I watched, the more I realized I was  watching a film that I knew nothing about, but knew everything about, and i was Mesmerized.  I found out at that time that I was Murray Burns(ok without the kid mind you).  I think that for someone my age, to see that in themselves, is pretty extraordinary.  Much of my life has been lived by the classic line in the film, when Arnie(Murrays Brother) says's to him...""You know Murray, there is only one thing separating you from complete happiness.  And do you know what that is?  Other People"".I try to live my life, by the way of Murray Burns. I often break out into a rather strange rendition of ""Yes Sir, That's My Baby"", at veryinopportune times, just to see who gets the joke.Genius.......One of the many films needed to be remastered and released to the general public that knows, what is worthy, and what is not.Om my GOD, I love this film so much.I thank you for letting me ramble.Now when the F%%k Can we see this released on DVD?",5,The Film That Made Me,1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,1476,"['just', 'need', 'say', 'favorite', 'film', 'time', 'One', 'strange', 'films', 'wonder', 'why', 'not', 'DVD', 'almost', 'everything', 'bad', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'is.I', 'need', 'tell', 'everyone', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'was', '12', 'yearsold', 'was', 'Saturday', 'night', 'used', 'take', 'TV', 'bathroom', 'watch', 'was', 'NBC', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Movies', 'lay', 'bathtub', 'film', 'came', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'more', 'watched', 'more', 'realized', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'knew', 'nothing', 'knew', 'everything', 'i', 'was', 'Mesmerized', 'found', 'out', 'time', 'was', 'Murray', 'Burns', 'kid', 'think', 'someone', 'age', 'see', 'pretty', 'extraordinary', 'Much', 'life', 'been', 'lived', 'classic', 'line', 'film', 'when', 'Arnie', 'Murrays', 'Brother', 'know', 'Murray', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'separating', 'complete', 'happiness', 'do', 'know', 'what', 'Other', 'People', '.I', 'try', 'live', 'life', 'way', 'Murray', 'Burns', 'often', 'break', 'out', 'rather', 'strange', 'rendition', 'Yes', 'Sir', 'That', 'My', 'Baby', 'veryinopportune', 'times', 'just', 'see', 'who', 'joke.Genius', '.One', 'many', 'films', 'needed', 'be', 'remastered', 'released', 'general', 'public', 'what', 'worthy', 'what', 'not.Om', 'GOD', 'love', 'film', 'so', 'much.I', 'thank', 'letting', 'ramble.Now', 'when', 'F', '%', '%', 'k', 'Can', 'see', 'released', 'DVD']",N/A

From the views of New York in the 1960's, to Jason Robards' irreverent attitude and care for his nephew, it's a fascinating movie.Robards is never bad, but this script is terrific, and so is the photography.  It's him v. the world--and he literally yells at them every day to wake up and live, exhorts them to get mad at how things are done.While he occasionally seems Peter Pan-ish, he does redeem himself by talking about the killing nature of a boring job, and does get a job if it means keeping his nephew.  The movie also mocks the bureaucracy--the idea that he'd be an unfit guardian to his precocious nephew--especially seen from the point of view of a person who's worked for state child protection agencies--is both accurate and as ridiculous as he thinks.Watch it if you like Robards, if you want to see New York in a lost era, if you're tired of a humdrum job, and think &#34;there's got to be more.&#34;",5,Take the time to watch this--Jason Robards is GREAT,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,1017,"[""'d"", 'heard', 'movie', 'never', 'saw', 'stumbled', 'antenna', 'all-movie', 'station', 'views', 'New', 'York', '1960', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'irreverent', 'attitude', 'care', 'nephew', 'fascinating', 'movie.Robards', 'never', 'bad', 'script', 'terrific', 'so', 'photography', 'v.', 'world', 'literally', 'day', 'wake', 'up', 'live', 'get', 'mad', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'occasionally', 'Peter', 'Pan-ish', 'redeem', 'talking', 'killing', 'nature', 'boring', 'job', 'get', 'job', 'keeping', 'nephew', 'movie', 'also', 'bureaucracy', 'idea', ""'d"", 'be', 'unfit', 'guardian', 'precocious', 'nephew', 'especially', 'seen', 'point', 'view', 'person', 'who', 'worked', 'state', 'child', 'protection', 'agencies', 'accurate', 'as', 'ridiculous', 'thinks.Watch', 'like', 'Robards', 'want', 'see', 'New', 'York', 'lost', 'era', ""'re"", 'tired', 'humdrum', 'job', 'think', '34', 'got', 'be', 'more.', '34']",N/A

Watching it now after all these years I still found it as charming as with the first time. This is mostly due to both the fine cast and the excellent script/story.All the main roles are finely acted: Jason Robards as a social misfit, Barbara Harris as a social worker who falls in love with him, Barry Gordon as a sincere and lovable little boy, plus Martin Balsam as Robards' brother, trying to get him back to the sphere of everyday  life - including a regular job.The central theme is so poignant that it carries the dramae of the whole movie: how much must a person, as a citizen and a member of a society, to comply with the regulations and expectations of his fellow people? How ethical  is the main protagonist's unwillingness to be part of the everyday rat race of the New York advertising business? Is it right of  him to raise his sister's abandoned kid by the same non-conformist principles that he himself lives by? One can also think of the film's ending, which I at least see quite ambiguous: is Robards' character's decision in the end made by outer pressure, or does he come to it freewillingly? The film does not answer this very central question directly, but leaves it to the viewer to decide.All in all, a great film, one that seems to stand the test of time.",4,"To be, or not to be, a conformist?",1307577600,"06 9, 2011",2011,1344,"['Saw', 'film', 'ago', 'TV', 'stuck', 'ever', 'Watching', 'now', 'years', 'still', 'found', 'as', 'charming', 'first', 'time', 'mostly', 'due', 'fine', 'cast', 'excellent', 'script/story.All', 'main', 'roles', 'are', 'finely', 'acted', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'social', 'misfit', 'Barbara', 'Harris', 'social', 'worker', 'who', 'love', 'Barry', 'Gordon', 'sincere', 'lovable', 'little', 'boy', 'Martin', 'Balsam', 'Robards', 'brother', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'sphere', 'everyday', 'life', 'including', 'regular', 'job.The', 'central', 'theme', 'so', 'poignant', 'dramae', 'whole', 'movie', 'how', 'much', 'must', 'person', 'citizen', 'member', 'society', 'comply', 'regulations', 'expectations', 'fellow', 'people', 'How', 'ethical', 'main', 'protagonist', 'unwillingness', 'be', 'part', 'everyday', 'rat', 'race', 'New', 'York', 'advertising', 'business', 'right', 'raise', 'sister', 'abandoned', 'kid', 'same', 'non-conformist', 'principles', 'One', 'can', 'also', 'think', 'film', 'ending', 'least', 'see', 'quite', 'ambiguous', 'Robards', 'character', 'decision', 'end', 'made', 'outer', 'pressure', 'come', 'freewillingly', 'film', 'not', 'answer', 'very', 'central', 'question', 'directly', 'viewer', 'decide.All', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'stand', 'test', 'time']",N/A

The film has wonderful location shots of Manhattan in the mid-1960s which give it a great documentary value outside of its engaging plot. Burns lives in a furnished room with his nephew in what looks like the upper west side; maybe it was filmed on the deserted streets closed down for demolition to make way for  Lincoln Center (as was West Side Story). The film shows us a Manhattan that was still an affordable place for ordinary middle-class people to live.By today's standards Robards' acting seems overdone and manic, but it perfectly fits the mood of the times and is fortunately balanced by the shrewd, nuanced performances by Martin Balsam, Barbara Harris and Barry Gordon. Gene Saks is scarily true to life as Burns' boss, the obnoxious  ""Chuckles The Chipmunk,"" a terrifying fifties-style TV kids host.Films about the kind of gentle rebellion that Burns engaged in got lost in the tumult of the later sixties (""The World of Henry Orient"" is another such film that comes to mind).

Its message is still relevant, its script masterful, its acting superb and the direction nearly perfect. Naturally a film this good is unavailable on DVD. And Murray would understand precisely why that is and make the appropriate wry observation. I recall Herb Gardner - whom I'd met on a few occasions - telling me how surprised he'd been at the success of both the play and the film. He attributed the film's great success to its amazing cast.Jason Robards' comic timing as the eccentric middle-aged dropout Murray is impeccable. Barbara Harris combines vulnerabilty and an offbeat charm that matches Robards' performance beautifully. Martin Balsam received an Oscar, mostly for his ""I lie a little"" speech. William Daniels plays officious better than anyone but it took me years to realize how caring he was trying to be, even returning to warn Murray that he was about to lose his adopted young nephew Nick Burns: a child known variously as Rafael Sabatini, Dr. Morris Fishbein, Woodrow, King, Rover, Wilbur, Malcolm, Theodore, Lefty, Chevrolet and Big Sam Burns. Gene Saks is truly a pathetic and desperate character: a characterization that is prescient in so many ways because there are more people like him all the time. And finally Barry Gordon as Nick etc. who gives precociousness a good name.I implore the powers that be to release this wondrous example of what our movie art once was capable of; when movies actually meant something and filled a two hour void by presenting something new and valuable about the human condition with all of its little ironies and tragedies and laughter born of pain.Mike Birman",5,A masterpiece from the sixties,1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,1728,"['Thousand', 'Clowns', 'brilliant', 'first', 'shot', 'counter', 'culture', 'revolution', 'sixties', 'message', 'still', 'relevant', 'script', 'masterful', 'acting', 'superb', 'direction', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'Naturally', 'film', 'good', 'unavailable', 'DVD', 'Murray', 'would', 'understand', 'precisely', 'why', 'make', 'appropriate', 'wry', 'observation', 'recall', 'Herb', 'Gardner', 'whom', ""'d"", 'met', 'few', 'occasions', 'telling', 'how', 'surprised', ""'d"", 'been', 'success', 'play', 'film', 'attributed', 'film', 'great', 'success', 'amazing', 'cast.Jason', 'Robards', 'comic', 'timing', 'eccentric', 'middle-aged', 'dropout', 'Murray', 'impeccable', 'Barbara', 'Harris', 'combines', 'vulnerabilty', 'offbeat', 'charm', 'Robards', 'performance', 'beautifully', 'Martin', 'Balsam', 'received', 'Oscar', 'mostly', 'lie', 'little', 'speech', 'William', 'Daniels', 'officious', 'better', 'anyone', 'took', 'years', 'realize', 'how', 'caring', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'even', 'returning', 'warn', 'Murray', 'was', 'lose', 'adopted', 'young', 'nephew', 'Nick', 'Burns', 'child', 'known', 'variously', 'Rafael', 'Sabatini', 'Dr.', 'Morris', 'Fishbein', 'Woodrow', 'King', 'Rover', 'Wilbur', 'Malcolm', 'Theodore', 'Lefty', 'Chevrolet', 'Big', 'Sam', 'Burns', 'Gene', 'Saks', 'truly', 'pathetic', 'desperate', 'character', 'characterization', 'prescient', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'are', 'more', 'people', 'time', 'finally', 'Barry', 'Gordon', 'Nick', 'etc', 'who', 'precociousness', 'good', 'name.I', 'powers', 'be', 'release', 'wondrous', 'example', 'what', 'movie', 'art', 'once', 'was', 'capable', 'when', 'movies', 'actually', 'meant', 'something', 'filled', 'two', 'hour', 'void', 'presenting', 'something', 'new', 'valuable', 'human', 'condition', 'little', 'ironies', 'tragedies', 'laughter', 'born', 'pain.Mike', 'Birman']",N/A

So that means nothing. So what if you're unfamiliar with the era, that just means you're too damn young. Next you'll tell me that Shakespeare is ""dated"". How about Citizen Kane? That's dated, too. I mean, what EXACTLY does describing something as being ""dated"" mean? Sure, it's a valid observation and no quality judgment is being implied, but to call something ""dated"" is basically to make a point out of your personal unfamiliarity and, I suppose, discomfort with the era in which a certain work was completed. Every day has a date, see? Check these reviews, each one of them is dated, so even the review that describes A Thousand Clowns as ""dated"". To be honest, that reviewer likes the film and I have no beef with them, I just want people to stop being so concerned with whether something is totally contemporary or not or making anything at all out of the fact that when movies, music, or anything else reaches a certain age as we get a certain distance away from it in time we can tell approximately what era its from because certain stylistic devices they utilize are no longer quite as current. Yeah, okay, valid point, but nobody seems to be noticing when a movie is ""up-to-date"". This factor is totally ignored. You don't say that Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift is ""too much of today"", you just say it's a piece of crap and move on. So STOP IT,  ALREADY! And my other point: YES, this is essentially a filmed stage play and it does have a certain staginess to it, BUT it was one of the very first American films to adopt some of the groundbreaking editing techniques of the French New Wave, so everytime Murray and Nick leave the apartment it becomes totally UNSTAGEY and very FILMY! Yeah, that sounds stupid to me, too, but it's true. The outdoor scenes are shot on the street, and for the most part are unstaged, almost verite in flavor. All of that was done consciously by the filmmakers to open the film up because they KNEW it was a play and would seem very stagey, and I think they did a good job.",5,Comedy Classic,1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,2133,"['Just', 'clear', 'up', 'few', 'misconceptions', 'read', 'here', 'First', 'movie', ""n't"", 'dated', 'Dated', 'What', 'TODAY', 'DATED', 'So', 'nothing', 'So', 'what', ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'era', 'just', ""'re"", 'too', 'damn', 'young', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'Shakespeare', 'dated', 'How', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'dated', 'too', 'mean', 'what', 'EXACTLY', 'describing', 'something', 'being', 'dated', 'mean', 'Sure', 'valid', 'observation', 'quality', 'judgment', 'being', 'implied', 'call', 'something', 'dated', 'basically', 'make', 'point', 'personal', 'unfamiliarity', 'suppose', 'discomfort', 'era', 'certain', 'work', 'was', 'completed', 'day', 'date', 'see', 'Check', 'reviews', 'one', 'dated', 'so', 'even', 'review', 'Thousand', 'Clowns', 'dated', 'be', 'honest', 'reviewer', 'film', 'have', 'beef', 'just', 'want', 'people', 'stop', 'being', 'so', 'concerned', 'something', 'totally', 'contemporary', 'not', 'making', 'anything', 'fact', 'when', 'movies', 'music', 'anything', 'else', 'certain', 'age', 'get', 'certain', 'distance', 'away', 'time', 'can', 'tell', 'approximately', 'what', 'era', 'certain', 'stylistic', 'devices', 'utilize', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'quite', 'current', 'Yeah', 'okay', 'valid', 'point', 'nobody', 'be', 'noticing', 'when', 'movie', 'up-to-date', 'factor', 'totally', 'ignored', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'Tokyo', 'Drift', 'too', 'much', 'today', 'just', 'say', 'piece', 'crap', 'move', 'So', 'STOP', 'IT', 'ALREADY', 'other', 'point', 'YES', 'essentially', 'filmed', 'stage', 'play', 'have', 'certain', 'staginess', 'BUT', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'first', 'American', 'films', 'adopt', 'groundbreaking', 'editing', 'techniques', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'everytime', 'Murray', 'Nick', 'leave', 'apartment', 'totally', 'UNSTAGEY', 'very', 'FILMY', 'Yeah', 'stupid', 'too', 'true', 'outdoor', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'street', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'unstaged', 'almost', 'verite', 'flavor', 'was', 'done', 'consciously', 'filmmakers', 'open', 'film', 'up', 'KNEW', 'was', 'play', 'would', 'seem', 'very', 'stagey', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job']",N/A
139615,A33XHXRTRZOQ12,0792838009,"Photoscribe ""semi-renaissance man""","[12, 13]","I, too, saw this movie when it was new in the sixties, and fell in love with it completely! Jason Robards, Bill Daniels, Barbara Harris and Barry Gordon are brilliant in this spare, low-budget film about some poor soul who feels overwhelmed by a monstrous New York workforce and the crass ""produce or perish"" world of TV production, specifically KIDDIE TV production! It's not difficult to portray the characters marked for ridicule as ridiculous: Chuckles the Chipmunk is an easy target, so is the social worker played by Bill Daniels. The scene where he calls Murray, Jason Robard's character, ""maladjusted"" and Murray's sarcastic reaction to it is the best one in the film!Why only four stars? Wellll...it's a great film, specifically due to the actors, but the PRODUCTION values are truly amateurish considering the well known talent involved in FRONT of the camera. Robards was married to Lauren Bacall at the time, Barry Gordon was ALREADY a veteran of films, Gene Saks is one of those golden age of TV comedians that worked for ""Your Show of Shows"" and Martin Balsam had at least a decade of film noir movies in back of him. The sound production is abysmal, at least for the music, however, the cinematography is excellent, capturing all the greys, shadows and highlights of its actors and New York interiors beautifully.Barbara Harris is as cute as bug's ear as the apprentice social worker that falls for Murray after rejecting her fiance. The Daniels character, who is very officious with her for a lover, gives Murray a great foot in the door to pry her away from him. Murray uses his nonconfirmist charm to sweep her off her feet so his little nephew, Nick, can have a Mommy to help take care of him.Barry Gordon, who couldn't be more than 15 or 16 here, is probably the most brlliant player in the movie, getting, walking away, the best lines in it, doing better, even, than Robards. A scene of his with a novelty statue involving alternating lights is priceless. Another scene involving him having to kiss up to Chuckles the Chipmunk and his explosive eventual rebellion against it defines the movie.If this movie had been released within the last twenty years, I guarantee you, it would have been one of the sleeper blockbusters of independent film history, rubbing shoulders with a certain big, fat, greek wedding...",4,"Whoops!!

139617,A3AJP2N1GP5E2W,0792838009,"Rand Careaga ""Rand Careaga""","[9, 11]","""A Thousand Clowns"" at last arrived, correctly packaged and labeled. I have preserved the saga of my original disappointment (two copies of a physically identical but digitally deficient product) below. I give the corrected product a solid four stars.Forty-plus years ago a professor of mine observed that with sufficient time art inevitably hardens into mere document, and that without a grounding in the actual culture from which a work of art was born, it would be harder and harder for subsequent generations of audiences to respond to it in terms of the associations it was originally intended to evoke. This professor was speaking of ""Beowulf,"" and even a group of freshman English majors could take the point that we were a little too far removed from the sensibilities of 10th century West Saxony to appreciate the poem quite the way its original bards intended.This came to mind last night as I watched ""A Thousand Clowns"" for the first time since its theatrical release in 1965. My wife, not *all* that much younger than I, was utterly without sympathy for Jason Robards' character Murray Burns. The iconoclastic free spirit that charmed cinema audiences in 1965 (and New York theatre audiences in 1962, when the play on which the film was based was first performed) was to her eyes a lazy, self-indulgent slacker. ""Take the goddamn job,"" she growled. She saw the character in the light of a 21st century grifter (""So you have to sell your soul for a paycheck? Join the club!"") whereas I, with slightly more vivid memories of the period saw him with a more indulgent eye.Without recapitulating the story in detail, Murray Burns, formerly chief writer for the ""Chuckles the Chipmunk"" children's television show, has been unemployed for five months when child welfare psychologists show up at the one-room Manhattan apartment he shares with his nephew Nick (portrayed by Barry Gordon, who early on does a very credible Peter Lorre imitation--he even looks like an infant Peter Lorre) and threaten to place Nick in a foster home absent some tangible evidence that Murray is a fit guardian. Stable employment, it turns out, is the principal criterion for such fitness, and over the next two days Murray agonizes over whether his soul or Nick's well-being is the more important to him.The cast is great. Jason Robards (perhaps five to seven years older than the part as written) performs quite ably, notwithstanding my spouse's sour review. Barbara Harris is cute as a bug, and her colleague/fiance, played by William Daniels, appears at the outset as an inflexible bureaucratic prig before he reveals unexpected depths of self-knowledge. Barry Gordon (sixteen, very convincingly playing almost-thirteen) is a joy to watch throughout. Gene Saks as the loathsome ""Chuckles the Chipmunk"" put me in mind of an older Steve Buscemi. And Martin Balsam as Murray's brother certainly deserved the Oscar he was awarded that year as Best Supporting Actor. Balsam was a craftsman: never a leading man, always a supporting player, but also always a credit to whatever film he was a part of.The screenplay betrays its origins as a stage play. This is not a bad thing. It's a tad talky, and there are set-piece speeches, but these are all intelligently written and largely well-delivered. The 1962 play was almost certainly staged  on ""indoor"" sets. The film, made in 1965, tries to extend itself to Manhattan at large. A few of these outdoor scenes (Robards on the streets haranguing his sleeping neighbors) work well enough; others (Robards and Gordon flying a kite, Robards and Harris sharing a tandem bicycle) seem to have been included for no other reason than that this sort of thing had worked with ""A Hard Day's Night"" the previous year. They don't really add anything to the film.Technical issues: For reasons that elude me, ""A Thousand Clowns"" has finally been released on DVD in ""burn-on-demand"" format, meaning that it has been transcribed on a substrate of light-sensitive dye, such as you or I might use to record data on a DVD burner attached to a home computer, and not physically stamped on the substrate as most commercial releases are. This concerned me because the last time I ordered a ""burn-on-demand"" title from Amazon (the 1985 film ""Dreamchild"") the DVD proved unplayable, skipping and finally seizing up (at varying points) on four computers and four DVD players. I should add that a kind friend later ordered a copy of the film from Amazon, played it without incident on his home theatre setup, and sent the DVD to me, where it played on my equipment without so much as a hiccup. Go figure.""A Thousand Clowns"" as received yesterday *will not play* on any of three Macintosh computers I've tried it on. However, it played almost without incident on my Sony DVD player. About four minutes in the picture and audio froze and stuttered about three times over the next twenty seconds, which filled me with dread--this is how ""Dreamchild"" had gone off the rails--but then the presentation recovered, and there were no further glitches through the end of the film. I should mention that the packaging stats the following: ""This disc is expected to play back in DVD Video ""play only"" devices, and may not play back in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives."" Fair enough. Still, a prospective consumer should understand that this format is a little dicey. If it doesn't work for you, don't hesitate to complain to Amazon (which has, incidentally, behaved very well toward me in this episode, even if it did take a while to get their attention).I'd give ""A Thousand Clowns"" four stars as delivered. A full commercial release would have rated five stars--what's not to like?--but the deficiencies of the format MGM/2KFox have settled upon for its release deserve to find reflection in its public evaluation.Original review (based on manufacturing slip-up) follows:*****""A Thousand Clowns"" has at last become available on DVD, although unfortunately only in the ""burn on demand"" format. Still, I ordered the movie shortly after I learned of its recent digital release, received it today, popped it into the player and...a 1939 Boris Karloff vehicle called ""The Mystery of Mr. Wong"" began to play. I've scanned through the entire DVD. It's all Karloff and no Jason Robards. The invoice says ""A Thousand Clowns."" The packaging says ""A Thousand Clowns."" The DVD itself says ""A Thousand Clowns."" My television says otherwise. I look forward to negotiating an exchange with Amazon.My two-star review obviously has nothing to do with the innate quality of ""A Thousand Clowns"" (which I would hope on the basis of my 1965 memory of it to rate quite highly) but perhaps it will serve to warn off early purchasers to wait until the problem is brought to the attention of MGM/20th Century Fox and, one devoutly hopes, speedily resolved.UPDATE, June 6: Amazon has, with admirable dispatch, replaced the mislabeled DVD with...an identically mislabeled DVD. I have a feeling this could turn into an infinite loop, since I'm far from certain that the Amazon end of these exchanges isn't being handled entirely by automated subroutines.UPDATE, June 13: Carbon-based life forms at Amazon have learned of the problem, moved to correct it, and in an email received just now promise that a proper disc will be on its way within a fortnight.",4,The Wong DVD

I saw this in its initial release (1965), and it was so powerful that I developed my own attitude toward life (at a mere 16 years old). There are really no bad guys; rather, it's the ""system"" that creates the problems (and things have only gotten worse). Since its merits have been well-examined, I think it's most interesting that, with the exception of ""Lilies of the Field"" (1963), 1965 was the year of the Indie. ""Darling"" and ""1000 Clowns"" were both surprise nominees for Best Picture. Both won acting awards. Unfortunately, Robards' performance was overlooked, and that is only another Oscar travesty. The film was nominated for Herb Gardner's adaptation of his play, and won Martin Balsam an Oscar, if only for one terrific scene in which he expresses his function and worth in the world at large. Barbara Harris and, especially, Barry Gordon, are excellent. With amazingly insightful direction from Fred Coe, there is no end of enjoyment and life-lessons, with Mr. Gardner's rapid-fire dialogue blowing one's mind. With ""The Sound of Music"", ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""Ship of Fools"" all vying for an Oscar, the fact that the Academy included this on their short-list must make a statement.

I was familiar with Jason Robards from films in which he played more serious characters, including Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee in the Watergate thrillerAll the President's Men, and as an evil rancher inComes a Horseman.  It was refreshing to see him as the lighthearted New Yorker who, with his serious nephew as a sidekick, attends Bon Voyage festivities for departing ocean liners just to enjoy the joyful farewells of people he has never even met.  In the end he romances the social worker sent to look in on his stewardship of his nephew--a woman who can hardly be expected to resist his effusive charm!

Made before the 60's actually became THE 60's, ""A Thousand  Clowns"" anticipates the coming decade and the struggle to become and remain  one's own person from several perspectives, doing justice to all of them.  Even characters who would be written off as one-dimensional villains in  lesser films are given their say and their dignity here; everyone clearly  has a life, complete with its sorrows and joys, and its own viewpoint. The  romance between Jason Robards and Barbara Harris is sweet, giddy and  touching; the love between Robards and his worshipping but clear-sighted  nephew (a superb Barry Gordon) is strong and moving.
