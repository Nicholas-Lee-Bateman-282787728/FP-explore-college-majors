I give this show a weak four stars versus a strong four stars due to the quirks that don't make much sense and don't really add to the movie. I think they were trying a little too hard to develop the characters. One example is a counselor that Jesse Stone is seeing. He smokes like a chimney during their sessions which I find a bit odd, but the larger oddity is the counselors quirk of frequently wiping his bottom lip on his shirt. That just looks ridiculous and adds absolutely nothing to the show. As matter of fact it is quite distracting. It would not be a big deal if the camera did not purposely zoom in on the guy to ensure that you see him doing that weird lip-wipe. Again, this is just one example of useless, nonsense that I assume is supposed to add to the guy's character. I think it makes him look more foolish than he already does. He dresses like a homeless guy too which just doesn't do anything but make me wish they would move on to the next scene that much quicker. If you saw the movie &#34;Langoliers&#34; one character who slowly went crazy was always tearing strips off of paper towels (or something). They would zoom in on him tearing those strips. One would think this means those strips must be a clue or a key aspect to the plot. It was not. It was just some guy tearing paper which added absolutely nothing to the movie. Yet the camera kept zooming in on him tearing paper and play &#34;scary&#34; music like it meant something. That is how the lip-wipe and some other quirks seem, just a waste of film and airtime.All and all, I think they have created an interesting dynamic. The pace is a little slow at times but those scenes do add to the overall dynamic of the show. Just when they lull you into imagining white, picket fences and rainbows, guns start blazing. This dynamic keeps me watching more intently as I anticipate the action scenes that often just creep up on you. Also, you never know which characters are going to be alive at the end of each of these movies. I could have done with a few less quirks.In this day and age, I think this show has captured a little allure of the black and white films mainly due to the writing, casting, and character development yet is still a very modern movie.Most people who enjoy a little drama as well as relating to characters should like this movie. Even the slow scenes are interesting and adds meaning to the overall mood of the show.",4,Well written show.

Selleck does what he can, but in fact, after watching three of these, I'm more than a little tired of many of Jesse's little quirks which are clearly supposed to be endearing but in fact are simply annoying. Rose (the always wonderful Kathy Baker) confronts him about being unable to reach him: &#8220;Jesse, why don&#8217;t you get a cellphone?&#8221; &#8220;Cause I don&#8217;t like &#8216;em; you can always page me.&#8221; &#8220;I have!&#8221; &#8220;Well, call me on the car radio.&#8221; &#8220;I have!&#34; His mantra to the town council: &#34;You can always fire me, but you can't tell me what to do.&#34; His sophomoric refusal to wear his badge, leaving him endlessly answering, when asked for it: &#34;It's in a drawer&#34;. The first time this happened was OK, but after that it got old. Would Jesse not write a ticket if someone told him their driver's license was in a drawer? Yeah, I didn't think so. Also, starting with the first episode, when he arbitrarily decides to call Luther &#34;Suit&#34;, a nickname Luther neither asked for nor particularly likes (but which is supposed to show us how very knowledgeable Jesse is about baseball, among other things, I guess): in that same episode, when DiAngelo addresses Jesse as &#34;Skipper&#34;, Jesse wastes no time letting him know that it's not OK to call him anything but his name, because although Jesse will call anyone anything he wants to, he will not tolerate anyone else doing the same thing. And don't get me started on his endless, pathetic, carrying of the torch for his whiny, self-centered ex, &#34;Jen&#34;. If Jesse were Jessie, pining away for her ex husband, maybe more viewers would be inclined to see this for the pathetic neurosis it really is instead of viewing it as cute and romantic and evidence of emotional depth, which it's not.

That was then.  As Jesse Stone, Selleck is superb, and we have become quit addicted to the series of films.  The first one we saw was Sea Change, quite by accident.  We did not know there were others, and it happens that Sea Change is Number 4.We could not resist seeing more of Jesse, so we did the research to find all eight of the films and to list them in proper sequence.  Then, we started with Number 1, Night Passage, and went through all eight of them, including a repeat of Sea Change.  Each film can stand alone, complete in itself, but with something at the end which whets one's appetite for the next one.  Besides, you just want to get back to Jesse and Reggie and Suitcase and Rose and all the rest.Selleck says he is not through with Jesse Stone, but he may not make any more of the films with CBS.  We eagerly await news of Number 9.Look, these are not Oscar-winning films.  They are not intended to be.  They are great entertainment, filled with characters we get to know and like.

Menta, Jr.","[120, 122]","Both sensitively acted and directed, ""Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise"" is another winner in the ""Jesse Stone"" series of television films.  Star Tom Selleck and director Robert Harmon must really be committed to this series, as every aspect of these productions are top notch.Of course, one can air a minor complaint here and there.  For example, like the previous entry, ""Jesse Stone: Night Passage"", this one ends a little too neatly and abruptly (just like in ""Passage"", everything is explained and resolved during a closing shoot-out), but that's only a small negative in an overall very good adaptation.  I'm certainly onboard for ""Jesse Stone: Sea Change"", the fourth movie in the series (I always wait for the DVD releases of these films because I hate all the television commercials).By the way, as these reviews are supposed to be ""helpful"", here's the order that I recommend that these stories should be watched:1)  Jesse Stone: Night Passage...  This was the second film to be produced, but chronologically (as it recounts Chief Stone's earliest days as Paradise's police chief) it takes place first.  For example, a character who is killed in ""Stone Cold"" (the first film produced) is seen good as new here, because of this story's earlier time frame.  Trust me, watch this one first.2)  Stone Cold...  The first film produced, but if you watch it second, you'll enjoy the seamless transition from ""Jesse Stone: Night Passage"" into ""Stone Cold"".  This also gives the aforementioned death in this movie more dramatic heft, because we've already seen Jesse spend a lot of time with the character in question in ""Passage"".3)  Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise... This one picks up directly after the events in ""Stone Cold"", even though it was produced right after the origin story that was ""Jesse Stone: Night Passage"".4)  Jesse Stone: Sea Change...  Fourth film to be produced, fourth film you should watch.  This one's easy enough, at least, right?One final thought, if you enjoy these TV films, you should try the Robert B. Parker novels in which they're based.  The films are very close to the novels, but the novels give you more details, a less compressed pace, and more vivid characterizations.

In any series, one is going to prefer some shows over others and this one I felt needed a tad more ""denouement""--in which the crime is explained, the villain unmasked etc--as my writing instructor would say.It just ended more abruptly than I would have wished. The main story line itself was pretty intriguing, but when it ended, found myself thinking, now what happened?Of course, this may be more like real life so others may prefer this more sudden end.

As before, the story is told in a nuanced and unflinching style, with atmospheric bleak music and dark cinematography.  What makes these movies so satisfying is the sense that they are so believable - whether it is the matter of fact way he deals with the crimes, or the sideline plots of domestic violence, or just Jesse Stone's inherent flaws which make him believably human.  He drinks.  He still harbours a little flame for his ex-wife.  The action when it happens is sparse and final.Previous entries have been solid 4 stars reaching towards the 5th... this one struggles a little to get that 4th star, having a few too many familiar elements from before - the woman of the episode, to act as a foil to Stone's character issues, the last minute tete a tete with the who of the whodunnit, wrapping things up just a little too succinctly.  Having said that, it earns the 4 stars, primarily thanks to Selleck who just gets better and better as he ages.Recommended, above par TV movie.",4,Selleck continues to shine,1252022400,"09 4, 2009",2009,1300,"['Tom', 'Selleck', 'returns', 'third', 'series', 'TV', 'movies', 'based', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'dogged', 'flawed', 'small', 'town', 'police', 'chief', 'written', 'Robert', 'Parker.This', 'time', 'round', 'story', 'around', 'young', 'teenager', 'murder', 'following', 'badly', 'decomposed', 'body', 'being', 'discovered', '3', 'weeks', 'disappearance', 'before', 'story', 'told', 'nuanced', 'unflinching', 'style', 'atmospheric', 'bleak', 'music', 'dark', 'cinematography', 'What', 'movies', 'so', 'satisfying', 'sense', 'are', 'so', 'believable', 'matter', 'fact', 'way', 'crimes', 'sideline', 'plots', 'domestic', 'violence', 'just', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'inherent', 'flaws', 'make', 'believably', 'human', 'still', 'little', 'flame', 'ex-wife', 'action', 'when', 'sparse', 'final.Previous', 'entries', 'have', 'been', 'solid', '4', 'stars', 'reaching', '5th', 'one', 'little', 'get', '4th', 'star', 'having', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'familiar', 'elements', 'woman', 'episode', 'act', 'foil', 'Stone', 'character', 'issues', 'last', 'minute', 'tete', 'tete', 'who', 'whodunnit', 'wrapping', 'things', 'up', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'succinctly', 'Having', 'said', '4', 'stars', 'primarily', 'thanks', 'Selleck', 'who', 'just', 'better', 'better', 'ages.Recommended', 'par', 'TV', 'movie']",Jesse Stone: Death In Paradise

Robert Harmon (director) and his production team yet again acheive an atmosphere of almost film noir edginess. The dialogue rings true and demonstrates much respect for Parker's original dialogue in the books. Stone (beautifully realized by Selleck) is efficient and dry in his language ... ""I'm the police chief, I know everything"", not unlike Parker's other literary sleuth, Spenser. In fact, now that Robert Urich is no longer with us, Selleck would make an ideal Spenser. Although a small town, Paradise, MA is not exempt from the crime, scandal and corruption imbedded in any other town, big or small.

1066108,A3I49HL6XR62DI,B000OVLBG2,Victoria A. Wildermuth,"[39, 42]","Tom Selleck IS Jesse Stone, a character created by the great mystery author Robert Parker. Selleck plays a burned out, alcoholic LA cop who takes a job in the small town of Paradise, Massachusetts as sheriff. ""Death in Paradise"" is a tale of domestic violence, mob intrigue and the poignant, obsessive quest by the emotionally damaged Stone for the killer of a young girl. This story line actually occurred in the Parker series prior to the novel that was the basis for CBS's fabulously successful ""Stone Cold"", Selleck's first outing as Jesse Stone. The screenwriters tweaked the plot of ""Death in Paradise"" a bit to make it a sequel to ""Stone Cold"" with excellent results. ""Death in Paradise"" features a powerhouse cameo by Steven Baldwin. In my opinion, Parker's Jesse Stone series is head and shoulders above the famous Spencer books. The Stone made-for-TV movies are quality productions with superb acting, beautiful cinematography and haunting music. Exceptional TV. Highly, highly recommended.
