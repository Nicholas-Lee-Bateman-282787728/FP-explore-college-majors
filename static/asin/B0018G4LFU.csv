I am an advanced exerciser who loves doing really fast dance workouts.  However, my mom who is in her late fifties tried this DVD and loved it.  She does it all the time now.  After you do an easy warm-up, Mirabai Holland, the teacher, teaches you easy moves to do that are great for older people who can't do the really fast DVDs.  The hardest move is a knee lift, and you could probably modify it to not have to do it.  The moves are taught, then done a lot of times that it made me bored, but older people will love the repetition as it will help them learn the steps.  There is a cool-down at the end with a bit of stretching, as well.  My mom's heart rate really gets up, but it doesn't affect mine at all.  It is a really short workout that older people and beginners to exercise will appreciate, but intermediate and advanced exercisers, go somewhere else.",4,Great for older people,1261094400,"12 18, 2009",2009,974,"['guess', 'when', 'saw', 'title', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fitness', 'levels', 'not', 'am', 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'who', 'doing', 'really', 'fast', 'dance', 'workouts', 'However', 'mom', 'who', 'late', 'fifties', 'tried', 'DVD', 'loved', 'time', 'now', 'do', 'easy', 'warm-up', 'Mirabai', 'Holland', 'teacher', 'teaches', 'easy', 'moves', 'do', 'are', 'great', 'older', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'really', 'fast', 'DVDs', 'hardest', 'move', 'knee', 'lift', 'could', 'probably', 'modify', 'not', 'have', 'do', 'moves', 'are', 'taught', 'then', 'done', 'lot', 'times', 'made', 'bored', 'older', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'repetition', 'will', 'help', 'learn', 'steps', 'cool-down', 'end', 'bit', 'stretching', 'as', 'well', 'My', 'mom', 'heart', 'rate', 'really', 'up', ""n't"", 'affect', 'mine', 'really', 'short', 'workout', 'older', 'people', 'beginners', 'exercise', 'will', 'appreciate', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'go', 'somewhere', 'else']","Moving Free Longevity Solution Cardio Dance Level 1 Easy Aerobics for Beginners, Boomers and Seniors Exercise by Mirabai Holland"

I do alot of the Walk Away The Pounds series and thought this would be a very good addition to my program.  I was right when I purchased this DVD,I absolutely love it.  I just used it last night and had quite a work out.  I believe you use every part of your body.  It's easy to follow and lasts for about 25-30 minutes.
