Richard Pryor on the 7th episode in the word association skit with Chevy Chase. There are the sketches and characters that became instant classic's and we still recognize The Bee's, Belushi's Samurai, Emily Littela, Baba Wawa,  and, of course, Weekend Update.Watching the first season is also a chance to watch Saturday Night Live evolve, as the they work out the format before it became formula. The second episode is almost all Paul Simon and his musical guests including Art Garfunkle and Randy Newman. The Not Ready for Prime Time Players weren't the stars of the show (they didn't even get singled out in the credits until February of 76), the guest hosts were. Saturday Night was a chance for the guest hosts like George Carlin to come on and do a longer set of their acts than other late night variety/talk shows like The Tonight Show.Some of the material and references in a few of the skits are dated and of the moment such as, ""The Claudine Longet Invitational,"" The Muppets seem oddly out of place. But the strength of the shows are the sketches and they're still laugh out loud funny, such as, John Belushi's Star Trek parody.The musical guests were hipper than your average show including the afore mentioned Paul Simon, Carly Simon, Jimmy Cliff, Janis Ian, Phoebe Snow, Patti Smith, John Sebastian, Rita Coolidge, Al Jarreau to mention only a few. Saturday Night also had semi-regular appearances of the soon to be famous, such as, Albert Brooks, Andy Kaufman, and Toni Basil.Special features include the screen tests of all The Not Ready for Prime Time Players after they were cast for the show, and an appearance on Tom Synder's Tomorrow show.Watching Saturday Night Live the First Season is the chance to remember Generalismo Francisco Franco is still dead.",5,When Saturday Night Live Was Funny!,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",2010,2125,"['was', 'time', 'when', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'went', 'parties', 'would', 'stop', 'watch', 'show', 'time', 'when', 'guests', 'were', 'acts', 'might', 'not', 'ordinarily', 'be', 'seen', 'TV', 'time', 'was', 'SNL', 'Dan', 'Ackroyd', 'was', 'thin.Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', '1975-1976', 'just', 'show', 'sketch', 'made', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'legendary', 'Richard', 'Pryor', '7th', 'episode', 'word', 'association', 'skit', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'are', 'sketches', 'characters', 'became', 'instant', 'classic', 'still', 'recognize', 'Bee', 'Belushi', 'Samurai', 'Emily', 'Littela', 'Baba', 'Wawa', 'course', 'Weekend', 'Update.Watching', 'first', 'season', 'also', 'chance', 'watch', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'evolve', 'work', 'out', 'format', 'became', 'formula', 'second', 'episode', 'almost', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'musical', 'guests', 'including', 'Art', 'Garfunkle', 'Randy', 'Newman', 'Not', 'Ready', 'Prime', 'Time', 'Players', 'were', ""n't"", 'stars', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'singled', 'out', 'credits', 'February', '76', 'guest', 'hosts', 'were', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'was', 'chance', 'guest', 'hosts', 'George', 'Carlin', 'come', 'do', 'longer', 'set', 'acts', 'other', 'late', 'night', 'variety/talk', 'Tonight', 'Show.Some', 'material', 'references', 'few', 'skits', 'are', 'dated', 'moment', 'such', 'Claudine', 'Longet', 'Invitational', 'Muppets', 'seem', 'oddly', 'place', 'strength', 'shows', 'are', 'sketches', ""'re"", 'still', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'such', 'John', 'Belushi', 'Star', 'Trek', 'musical', 'guests', 'were', 'hipper', 'average', 'show', 'including', 'afore', 'mentioned', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'Jimmy', 'Cliff', 'Janis', 'Ian', 'Phoebe', 'Snow', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'John', 'Sebastian', 'Rita', 'Coolidge', 'Al', 'Jarreau', 'mention', 'only', 'few', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'also', 'had', 'semi-regular', 'appearances', 'soon', 'be', 'famous', 'such', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'Toni', 'Basil.Special', 'features', 'include', 'screen', 'tests', 'Not', 'Ready', 'Prime', 'Time', 'Players', 'were', 'cast', 'show', 'appearance', 'Tom', 'Synder', 'Tomorrow', 'show.Watching', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'First', 'Season', 'chance', 'remember', 'Generalismo', 'Francisco', 'Franco', 'still', 'dead']",N/A

Canadian Lorne Michaels launched NBC's Saturday Night(the original name) at 11:30 PM,eastern standard time,applying to New York where this comedy-variety ninety-minute show was based. Michaels carefully assembled his first team consisting of American and Canadian comedians. The American members are John Belushi,who died in 1982 of a drug overdose,Jane Curtin,Garrett Morris,the only black member,Laraine Newman of Los Angeles and Chevy Chase. Dan Aykroyd and Gilda Radner who succumbed to ovarian cancer in 1989,were the Canadians and veterans of Second City TV. Newman was a founding member of a comedy troupe called The Groundlings,which caught Michaels' attention seeing them in a Los Angeles Comedy Club. Billy Crystal nearly made the first SNL team,but was rejected just before premiere time(Crystal,late of TV's ""Soap"" and currently one of Hollywood's biggest film stars,finally joined for one season in 1984-85). This legendary show begins with Belushi and the late Michael O'Donoghue,one of the writers, in a skit called ""The Wolverines"". O'Donoghue played a psychiatrist and Belushi was a patient. Belushi became so wild and then Chase,wearing a headset,delivered the first beginning announcement,""LIVE FROM NEW YORK,IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!"". Chase gained an abundance of notoriety on SNL. He was the first Weekend Update anchorman and did quite a few rehearsed pratfalls. He didn't stay long,for as he left SNL just after the second season premiere for a movie career which still continues today but is no longer persistent. Fame from SNL brought Aykroyd,Belushi and Radner,for a while,to filmdom. SNL's first guest host was comedian George Carlin and the first musical guests were Janis Ian and the late Billy Preston. Almost every subsequent show had one or two guest hosts and musical guests. Following Carlin this season were Rob Reiner,Paul Simon,Candice Bergen,the late Richard Pryor and the recently departed Peter Boyle,to name a few. On Reiner's show, which aired via satellite like the other preceding and following shows,he,with his then-wife Penny Marshall,half-angrily exclaimed his disdain for the Bees skit,one of the regulars. Belushi apologized for ""ruining the show"". How about the man-eating shark skit,inspired by the then-new hit movie JAWS? Simon with Art Garfunkel,performed MY LITTLE TOWN and THE BOXER,on the second show.

It was LIVE FROM NEW YORK,ITS SATURDAY NIGHTI remember watching my favorite comedian George Carlin on the openning show. then my favorite singer Paul Simon on the second show. This show was my 16 year old dream, entertainment that was not my parent's show--it was MINENow 27 years later, I watched these archieve shows and feel young again. The sound quality is great, the masters are so cleaned up and fresh....it as if it was shot todayAll the skits I remember are there..the Ford jokes, Weekend update with Chevy Chase, Land Shark, the BEES!, The Muppets with an adultish piece(Jim Henson at the helm)(NOTE DISNEY, where is MUPPET SHOW season two), Chevy Chase SNL falling opennings, a film by Albert Brooks...thru these DVDs I transended time and space. To watch Gilda Radner and John Belushi  both alive and  in their rough comerdy beginnings is amazing  treat for me. To Watch A pre ""Kate And Allie"" Jane Curtin,  Chevy Chase, Dan Ackroyd and Garrett Morris meshing their talents. This was SNL's virgin season and I am 16 againIt is amazing seeing the musicial guests, the comedy skits, the fun of these classic moments--meshing all together...even after all these years it works. OKAY, I admit it..I AM A FAN and its all worth it!This was SNL's humble beginnings..pre Eddie Murphy, Martin Short, Billy Crystal, Adam Sandler, Mike Myers, Bill  Murray, Tiny Fey, and many others who started and owes their careers to SNL.

1027658,A1GUC3M5O1C1YK,B000JLQPYK,billymac72,"[364, 385]","For several years, I stayed up well past 2am on Saturday nights hoping to catch reruns of the classic, full SNL shows from 1975-1980. NBC was re-airing some of these great programs in their entirety (not ""best of"" packages) with few exceptions, starting in the late 1990s in most NBC outlets. Unfortunately, the original cast shows were the exception and the Dana Carvey and/or Will Farrell years were the norm. After several years, I managed to videotape about 25-30 original cast shows, but only about 4 from the first season.Younger audiences unfamiliar with the original SNL will likely be surprised by a number of things in viewing this great collection. Firstly, for those of us who remember, SNL was the most weird and cutting-edge show to be found in those days. The concept of ""late night"" television was certainly not then what it is today either. There really is no ""late night"" anymore, what with hundreds of cable/satellite channels and the Internet to keep us entertained around the clock. In the '70s, however, late night was a wasteland of old movies and reruns. Most stations ended their broadcast day by about 1 or 2am (for the tech-geners, this means the three network stations, one public station and typically about 3 or 4 local stations). As far as the networks were concerned, Johnny Carson owned the airways after the local news; this was literally true in many ways. Although not on air during the weekend, Carson Productions was quite a powerful entity, owning many weekend program slots. Beyond local news & the Tonight Show, there was little interest in developing a ""late night"" program. Secondly, SNL had huge shock value for a culture that wasn't used to seeing risqu&eacute; material paraded constantly on broadcast TV. For that stuff, most of us had to go to the movies for ""un-edited"" material. VCRs were not yet in every household and cable was only available in limited format in markets like New York. In the culture that was then, SNL's impact was enormous, providing essential ""water cooler"" chat on Monday morning. It was what people stayed home for on Saturday nights. It was really the only ""hip"" show on TV.The Not Ready for Primetime Players were a product of the counterculture 1960s. Much of their humor - especially the now surprising amount of drug references - will seem not only brazenly un-PC (thank heaven!), but incredibly raw for those used to the, ironically, structured and institution-ized nature of the show today. In this sense, the first season shows will not only appear dated, but also register way over-the-heads of most younger viewers. SNL has always been and always will be a victim of instant-datedness, in large part due to one of their greatest attributes: topical comedy. Even some of us still familiar with the pressing issues of the 70s may have a hard time remembering every reference!These earlier shows are also striking in their experimentation. The format we now know & love was at least two seasons in the making. The cast themselves were not considered as the main draw, amazingly enough, and their presence in the first few shows is remarkably sparse. In fact, the second episode is largely music-oriented. Many creative techniques were tried, and some fail miserably. Watch how poorly Abba (although a good performance) are incorporated into an already-in-progress Robert Klein skit. Fast forward past the Muppets if you will...or, if you found them humorous & innovative, as I did, marvel at Jim Henson's shocking (for him anyway) use of drug-related humor! No matter what the result, it's great to see a show daring enough to explore such diverse elements of entertainment, from short films, stand-up comedy, audience participation, to the even occasional use of dramatic device & pathos in the skits. All these things are largely verboten on the show today. Fondly remember a time when often obscure musical guests were chosen for their performance chops and uniqueness, and rarely their pop status, let alone how well they could lip synch (oddly this was not completely true with Abba...but that's a long story!).

I promise to never post without actually watching first. Sorry, I was too excited about the release.Expectations: I'll summarize first by saying you have to expect something that is 30+ years old to have production quality and some humor that seems a little dated, imperfect and dare I say, not standing the test of time (back then I watched it on a black and white TV with fuzzy reception by the way). If you didn't live back then or watch these episodes the first time or as repeats in the late 70s, you probably won't appreciate this as much as us original SNL fans and old timers do now. On the other hand, if you loved SNL back then and recognize how ground breaking it was, I don't think you will be disappointed now with this trip down memory lane. This set is a joy.Important note: You must realize most TV shows do not hit stride right out of the box (sorry about the sports metaphor). The 1975-76 season shows the concept and cast in it's infancy. It gets better with each show and season from 1975-1980. It is obvious what an experiment this show was at the beginning. It is a joy to see how some things became immediately popular and reworked into the show in later episodes and season. What a terrific way to reward loyal followers. SNL's early years had some bumps in the road, but it hits it's stride in the late 70s. Don't give up on it because of a lame skit or show here and there. They were not all perfect just like today's SNL (or especially like today's SNL).Favorite episode so far: when Paul Simon hosted the 2nd show. I'm biased because I love his music but his 1 on 1 basketball skit (filmed-not live) with that pro-player (whatever his name) is one of the funniest skits I have ever seen on SNL.Favorite guest hosts so far: I really enjoyed everything about the young, funny, entertaining and stunningly beautiful Candy Bergen. Lily Tomlin was hilarous as was Rob Reiner.Favorite Cast: Watching John Belushi and Danny Ackroyd grow and really start to come into their own with each episode is precious. I remember thinking Bill Murray was the best in the late 70s. I might have to rethink after the later seasons come out. I'm starting to think Ackroyd was the best. Weekend update seems to gain steam and confidence with each episode as well.Favorite skits, etc: Land shark, bee skits, muppets (I know some people hated the muppets, but me, my wife and my brother-in-law make 3 people that held our bellies and squealed whenever they came on the show...funny then, funny now). I also enjoyed the Albert Brooks skits. What a wacky sense of humor. Loved the new season line up, Black Vet (veteran/veteranian).My rating: My original pre-viewing 5-star rating stands, so far. I've made it through about half the episodes and have no post-purchase doubts.Can't wait to see: Patti Smith. Perhaps my favorite singer/songwriter of the 1970s.I will update once I finish the last 12 episodes, but as far as the first 12, 5 stars!",5,"Old-timers will love it, new kids might not.",1165190400,"12 4, 2006",2006,3024,"['wanted', 'update', 'review', 'now', 'have', 'actually', 'had', 'time', 'watch', 'promise', 'never', 'post', 'actually', 'watching', 'first', 'Sorry', 'was', 'too', 'excited', 'release.Expectations', ""'ll"", 'summarize', 'first', 'saying', 'have', 'expect', 'something', '30+', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'production', 'quality', 'humor', 'little', 'dated', 'imperfect', 'dare', 'say', 'not', 'standing', 'test', 'time', 'back', 'then', 'watched', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'fuzzy', 'reception', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'back', 'then', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'repeats', 'late', '70s', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'as', 'much', 'original', 'SNL', 'fans', 'old', 'timers', 'do', 'now', 'other', 'hand', 'loved', 'SNL', 'back', 'then', 'recognize', 'how', 'ground', 'breaking', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'now', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'set', 'joy.Important', 'note', 'must', 'realize', 'most', 'TV', 'shows', 'do', 'not', 'hit', 'stride', 'right', 'box', 'sorry', 'sports', 'metaphor', '1975-76', 'season', 'concept', 'cast', 'infancy', 'better', 'show', 'season', '1975-1980', 'obvious', 'what', 'experiment', 'show', 'was', 'beginning', 'joy', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'became', 'immediately', 'popular', 'reworked', 'show', 'later', 'episodes', 'season', 'What', 'terrific', 'way', 'reward', 'loyal', 'followers', 'SNL', 'early', 'years', 'had', 'bumps', 'road', 'stride', 'late', '70s', 'Do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'lame', 'skit', 'show', 'here', 'there', 'were', 'not', 'perfect', 'just', 'today', 'SNL', 'especially', 'today', 'SNL', '.Favorite', 'episode', 'so', 'far', 'when', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'hosted', '2nd', 'show', ""'m"", 'biased', 'love', 'music', '1', '1', 'basketball', 'skit', 'filmed-not', 'live', 'pro-player', 'name', 'one', 'funniest', 'skits', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'SNL.Favorite', 'guest', 'hosts', 'so', 'far', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'everything', 'young', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'Candy', 'Bergen', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'was', 'hilarous', 'was', 'Rob', 'Reiner.Favorite', 'Cast', 'Watching', 'John', 'Belushi', 'Danny', 'Ackroyd', 'grow', 'really', 'start', 'come', 'own', 'episode', 'precious', 'remember', 'thinking', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'was', 'best', 'late', '70s', 'might', 'have', 'rethink', 'later', 'seasons', 'come', ""'m"", 'starting', 'think', 'Ackroyd', 'was', 'best', 'Weekend', 'update', 'gain', 'steam', 'confidence', 'episode', 'well.Favorite', 'skits', 'etc', 'Land', 'shark', 'bee', 'skits', 'muppets', 'know', 'people', 'hated', 'muppets', 'wife', 'brother-in-law', 'make', '3', 'people', 'held', 'bellies', 'squealed', 'whenever', 'came', 'show', 'funny', 'then', 'funny', 'now', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'skits', 'What', 'wacky', 'sense', 'humor', 'Loved', 'new', 'season', 'line', 'up', 'Black', 'Vet', 'veteran/veteranian', '.My', 'rating', 'original', 'pre-viewing', '5-star', 'rating', 'stands', 'so', 'far', ""'ve"", 'made', 'episodes', 'have', 'post-purchase', 'doubts.Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'Perhaps', 'favorite', 'singer/songwriter', '1970s.I', 'will', 'update', 'once', 'finish', 'last', '12', 'episodes', 'as', 'far', 'first', '12', '5', 'stars']",N/A
1027660,A1HG2DOSBZEX4I,B000JLQPYK,Bryan A. Pfleeger,"[14, 19]",I will say that I was a little hesitant to buy this set. Looking back over a thirty year period the material shows a little age but it still has the potential to be as funny as it was all those years ago. The original cast is what makes this series great. I will confess that I did stop watching the TV show some years ago.The set does some things right and others not so well. The episodes are presented in their original 90 minute formate which equates to about 65 minutes an episode. It must be remembered that this is 30 year old television so the image quality is not perfect in fact its far from. It would be my guess that this package will be remastered some time in the future to clean up this problem. The sound is standard Dolby 2.0 so its sort of hit and miss. The extras include screen tests for the original Not Ready For Prime Time Players and an episode of the Today show which featured the cast.The packaging is built to last in that the discs are stored in a hard bound keepcase. The internal packaging features the discs and a brief description of the date of premier and the host and musical guests. In this first season the hosts were sort of hit and miss but there is enough good stuff here to keep you watching. The show is best savored in small amounts and I certainly would not attempt to watch all the episodes back to back.All in all this is a worthwhile purchase if just for the fact that it takes you back to the genesis of a show that has lasted for 30 years and has become an icon.

The comedy is not up to the high school level; one after another of the sketches falls completely flat.  And there should be a contest about who was the worst host.  Rob Reiner was pathetic.  Lily Tomlin was excruciatingly bad.  And as for Louise Lasser.....Then there was the bad music.  And the garrish clothes. And the stiflingly uniform political correctness (even before the term was invented), made to seem oh-so-daring.  (It takes a lot of courage and smarts to make fun of Gerald Ford.)  In short, drugs help make these programs funnier than they were.  Which is surely one of the problems haunting the performers and the writers who concocted some of the lamest excuses for comedy to be seen anywhere.",2,The depths of 1975,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,835,"['want', 'remember', 'learn', 'about', 'how', 'utterly', 'rotten', '1975', 'was', 'exhibit', 'first', 'season', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'comedy', 'not', 'up', 'high', 'school', 'level', 'one', 'sketches', 'completely', 'flat', 'should', 'be', 'contest', 'who', 'was', 'worst', 'host', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'was', 'pathetic', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'was', 'excruciatingly', 'bad', 'Louise', 'Lasser', '..Then', 'was', 'bad', 'music', 'garrish', 'clothes', 'stiflingly', 'uniform', 'political', 'correctness', 'even', 'term', 'was', 'invented', 'made', 'seem', 'oh-so-daring', 'lot', 'courage', 'smarts', 'make', 'fun', 'Gerald', 'Ford', 'short', 'drugs', 'help', 'make', 'programs', 'funnier', 'were', 'Which', 'surely', 'one', 'problems', 'haunting', 'performers', 'writers', 'who', 'concocted', 'lamest', 'excuses', 'comedy', 'be', 'seen', 'anywhere']",N/A
1027662,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000JLQPYK,calvinnme,"[28, 29]","If you want to know where the U.S. was culturally and politically post-Watergate, you need look no further than season one of Saturday Night Live. You might say that the 60's didn't happen to America outside of special enclaves such as San Francisco until the 70's, and this show was part of that revolution.In 1975, NBC was at the bottom of the then three-network barrel. Their only real hit show was Johnny Carson's ""Tonight Show"". So In 1974, when NBC Tonight Show host Johnny Carson requested that the weekend broadcasts of ""Best of Carson"" come to an end so that he could take 2 weeknights off and air repeats on those nights rather than on the weekend, NBC had no alternative but to comply with their star's wishes. To fill the gap, Lorne Michaels was hired to produce a new late-night show for the Saturday slot, and ""Saturday Night Live"" was born.Michaels fought and cajoled network executives to accept his vision for the show, which was far removed from standard variety-show conventions. For example, one network executive, visiting a dress rehearsal, noticed that the band was in blue jeans and asked when their tuxedos would arrive. Before the show began Michaels had remarked that he knew what the ""ingredients (of the show) would be, but not the proportions,"" and that the show would have to ""find itself"" on-air. Indeed, the Not Ready for Primetime Players were hardly featured in the premiere, but quickly became the focus of the show, with the guest host and musical act playing a secondary role. Albert Brooks and the Muppets were also dropped after the first season.As other reviewers have mentioned, if you weren't old enough to follow politics or popular culture in 1975, you aren't going to get the jokes in their entirety like you would if you were old enough. Fortunately, even if you are younger, you are in for quite a few musical treats as the musical guests are outstanding - Billy Preston performs ""Nothing for Nothing""; Janis Ian performs ""At Seventeen""; Paul Simon performed ""Still Crazy After All These Years"" and ""Loves Me Like A Rock"" solo and ""The Boxer"" and ""Scarborough Fair"" with Art Garfunkel;ABBA performed ""Waterloo"" and ""S.O.S.""; and The Stylistics performed ""You Make Me Feel Brand New."" These are all mainstream 70's songs and performers that should be recognizable to almost anyone. Musical guest appearances on TV may seem like no big deal in the age of the iPod, but in 1975 such appearances were treasured.However, if you are younger, you are going to miss out on some of the hard-biting political satire, including Chevy Chase's hilarious imitations of then President Ford featuring him constantly tripping over things, talking with the phone receiver inverted, and repeatedly telling a ceramic dog placed near his desk ""Down Liberty, Down! Good Dog!"" Also, the significance of certain guests such as President Ford's press secretary Ron Nessen will escape younger viewers - nobody under 40 who isn't a political science major is going to know who he is. Many elements of the regularly featured news skit ""Weekend Update, which paved the way for shows such as ""The Daily Show"", will not be familiar to under-40 viewers such as the ""Ferdinand Francisco Franco is still dead"" remark that Chevy Chase keeps making. You'll find the original cast as ""The South American Killer Bees"" hilarious, but you probably won't know that at the time there actually was a scare that a particular poisonous and aggressive species of bee might migrate north from South America and start attacking Americans. I could go on and on, but you get the picture.One of my favorite ""characters"", who makes his first appearance in a short skit in episode 15 of the first season, is ""Mr. Bill"". Mr. Bill is the clay figurine star of what at first appears to be a children's show. Each Mr. Bill episode would start innocently enough, but would quickly turn dangerous for Mr. Bill. Along with his dog, Spot, he would suffer various indignities inflicted by Mr. Hands, a man seen only as a pair of arms. Although often the abuse would ostensibly come from the mean Sluggo, another clay figure character. The violence would inevitably escalate, generally ending with Mr. Bill being crushed or dismembered while squealing, ""Ohhhh noooooooooooooo...."" It is like seeing the claymation duo of Davey and Goliath being run over and crushed by a tank, and is typical of the great ""nothing is sacred"" attitude this show had.In summary, old or young, I would say this is a definitely essential purchase. If you're older you'll just get more out of the show because you'll likely remember the context of it all.",5,A good look at U.S. culture and comedy immediately post-Watergate,1165708800,"12 10,

After that, I would stay up on weekends to enjoy the show whenever I could.  After so much time, I wasn't sure whether these programs would live up to my fond memories of them, so I was very pleased to see that for the most part they do.  It's great to see comedians like Dan Ackroyd and John Belushi at the beginning of their careers, not mention guest stars like Andy Kaufman and George Carlin.  There are some terrific performances from musicians who were at their zenith in the 70s, like Janis Ian, Leon Redbone, Carly Simon, and Gordon Lightfoot.Late night programming was a new thing, and it's interesting to watch the format evolve.  There was a lot of experimentation.  Along with the comedy, there were also bits that went for pathos and conceptual comedy rather than big laughs, which sometimes makes the show seem rather innocent when compared with today's hip, ironic sensibility.  At other times, it displays a harder edge with drug humor that has gone out of fashion in this PC era.

Most of the episodes on this set I saw in these 60 min. versions, so there is material here I've never seen. For the most part the second musical performance for each artist was cut, as well as some of the guest comical appearances and some ""lesser"" sketches. A bit later, (in the 1990s) the ""new-improved"" re-runs were put in syndication and the first travesty occured...30 min. chop-jobs! In the 1980s, Warners released a couple of episodes in their original 60+ minute (90-commercial time)format, but not many. Then the ""best of"" tapes began appearing. With DVD there arose hope. Maybe now we could have those seasons! Star Trek was doing it as well as other shows. Years passed, however, and more abyssmal ""best of"" samplers came out. Then, last year, ads began appearing for box sets! Of course our excitement died down when those sets turned out to be more of those ""best of"" discs bound together. When would we ever have our full seasons? Rumors began to float of full ""seasons"" of the syndicated 30 or 60 minute broadcasts. It was not the best, but it still was better than those cheesy ""best-of"" samplers with 20-30 minute mini-episodes and mish-mashed sketches. Then, about three days ago, I found out about this. Today, I picked it up. Finally! The show the way it should be seen! These episodes are WAAAYYYY better than they were back when I used to see them as 60 min. edits. This is it! I've personally been waiting for something like this since VHS and Beta were the best ways to get recorded programs. I've been waiting for these DVDs since the DVD format started doing TV sets. Buy them and watch them and see what SNL REALLY is about. This is the real thing. The Not Ready for Prime Time Players in all their glory. I did have to bring a tissue, however, as I began tearing up at seeing this set as a reality and not as a long awaited dream. This is as exciting as Star Wars being re-released in its original form. 2006 will go down as The Year of the DVD.Five stars? Oh, definitely. :)",5,F I N A L L Y ! ! ! Finally!!!

Bendokus,"[6, 10]","After all these years listening to Lorne Michaels state in interviews that SNL would never be released in full seasons, it was quite the shock to see this on Amazon. This is one of the most historically important DVD sets ever to see the light of day and I just pray that there are no edits on the set. Based on past experience with DVD box sets, I'll believe this when I see it. I will be amazed if the Louise Lasser and Milton Berle episodes make it to DVD. (In the case of the Milton Berle episode, no loss there if it doesn't, believe me.)Anyway, some of my greatest memories from childhood were staying up late on Satuday nights (I was 9 years old in '75) and watching SNL with my parents. Even though I didn't understand much of the humor in those days (Chevy Chase's ""No, it did NOT look like you were napping!"" comment on Weekend Update comes to mind), I knew this show was something special and have been hooked on it ever since. These days, it's almost impossible to make a teen understand that people actually stayed HOME on a Saturday night to watch a TV show, but we did. And we loved it.There are so many great moments in the early seasons of this show that I simply cannot wait to view these shows again. I especially look forward to seeing Mr. Mike (Michael O' Donoghue, who is sadly no longer with us) plunging needles into people's eyes again. Micheal's sick, twisted sense of humor had a tangible edge to it that I really miss today. Comedy shows seem so tame and by-the-numbers these days in comparison. This show had a PULSE in its early days.Overall, Mr. Michaels and company really did succeed in creating the American Monty Python and I am simply overjoyed that these shows are finally coming back home in their entirety.

Your eyes will POP!My favorites from the first season were always Chevy and Dan Aykroyd; I feel Belushi was talented, but he seemed to be an ""angry"" comedian, which always turned me off...plus the fact that he was extremely jealous of the attention Chevy was receiving from the public and the press. During the last half of the season, you'll notice the animosity Belushi had for Chevy when they appear in skits together, most notably the Weekend Update editorials.Jane Curtin appears to be sexier than I remembered her and Gilda Radner seems to be the most approachable, but Laraine Newman is the one I had the hots for...and watching this set reminds me why! Garrett Morris always appeared to be the most ignored of the cast and you can tell he's nervous in some of the shows, but he pulls off some top-notch moments, like his Sammy Davis impersonation and the Namibia spokesman. He also seems to be one of the friendlier members of the cast.Billy Crystal makes an appearance (as Bill Crystal) in one of the shows and you wonder why he chose the material he used for his standup routine. It's not funny at all; it's more of an extended impersonation that's humorless...even the audience can barely muster up a snicker! It's interesting to see this performance and realize what an accomplished comedian, actor and host he has become since.The bonuses are the screen tests of all seven stars and a five minute appearance Lorne and the cast made on Tom Snyder's ""Tomorrow"" show before SNL made it's debut.I hope this sells well so Lorne will churn out the remaining seasons, MORE than just one a year! I can't wait over 30 years to collect the whole set! AT LEAST release them on a quarterly basis so we can get 'em! I realize it's a pain to get clearance for the music but it's worth it and it shows.

I personally like the films by Gary Weis and Albert Brooks, although they might not be to everyone's taste. I never liked the show once it got too slick, somewhere around 1984, and if those collections are released I will not be buying them (despite some awesome musical guests).Mostly, these 1975-76 shows make me feel nostalgic. I also mourn so many of the talent that are no longer with us: Of course, John Belushi, Gilda Radner and Michael O'Donoghue; but Jim Henson, Andy Kaufman, Richard Pryor, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Billy Preston, Madeline Kahn, Peter Boyle, Desi Arnaz,  Anthony Perkins, a few others... The level of talent in front and behind the camera was so very high: Bandleader Howard Shore now composes Academy Award-winning scores; and there's Paul Shaffer leading Murphy Dunne and Lou Marini (to name but two) through their versatile paces in several numbers.I find it all hugely entertaining and I am looking forward to the rest of the Seventies SNLs in their complete form.",5,"A mix of classic, cult, and offbeat entertainment",1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,1359,"['Just', 'few', 'random', 'thoughts', 'memory-provoking', 'set.In', 'complete', 'set', 'such', 'fine', 'collection', 'one', 'obviously', 'going', 'get', 'plenty', 'stuff', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'weird', 'offbeat', 'what', 'believe', 'made', 'Seventies', 'television', 'expecially', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'what', 'was', 'attempt', 'stretch', 'what', 'was', 'possible', 'major', 'network', 'show', 'personally', 'films', 'Gary', 'Weis', 'Albert', 'Brooks', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'never', 'liked', 'show', 'got', 'too', 'slick', 'somewhere', '1984', 'collections', 'are', 'released', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'buying', 'awesome', 'musical', 'guests', '.Mostly', '1975-76', 'shows', 'make', 'feel', 'nostalgic', 'also', 'mourn', 'so', 'many', 'talent', 'are', 'longer', 'course', 'John', 'Belushi', 'Gilda', 'Radner', 'Michael', ""O'Donoghue"", 'Jim', 'Henson', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'Peter', 'Cook', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'Billy', 'Preston', 'Madeline', 'Kahn', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'Desi', 'Arnaz', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'few', 'others', 'level', 'talent', 'front', 'camera', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'high', 'Bandleader', 'Howard', 'Shore', 'now', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'scores', 'Paul', 'Shaffer', 'leading', 'Murphy', 'Dunne', 'Lou', 'Marini', 'name', 'two', 'versatile', 'paces', 'several', 'numbers.I', 'find', 'hugely', 'entertaining', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'rest', 'Seventies', 'SNLs', 'complete', 'form']",N/A

Gelwasser,"[7, 8]","When I found out that the entire first season of ""Saturday Night Live"" was about to be released to DVD, I was beside myself with excitement! Why? Because I have some great memories of growing up with this hilarious, revolutionary show in it's very early years.I was 13 years old and pretty much spent my boring weekend nights babysitting for extra cash. The kids I sat for forced me to sit through endless torturous hours of ""The Love Boat"" and ""Fantasy Island"" (Ugghh!! I'm still having Charo flashbacks!!). But once the kiddies went to bed and 11:30 PM rolled around, something magical and exciting seemed to finally happen on the tube.""Saturday Night Live"" was a TV show, that seemed like a hip, super cool club, that everyone wanted to be a part of. The fact, that it was being broadcast live, seemed to give it an almost dangerous quality. The humour was revolutionary with lots of references to sex, drugs and rock n' roll. (Hardly the stuff, that my middle aged, parents found remotely funny.) This truely was the first network TV show brought to you by the babyboom generation, who had grown up with television.The guest hosts were celebrities you didn't ordinarily see to often on network television (Elliot Gould, George Carlin, Robert Klein, Richard Pryor ETC.). The same went for the musical acts, that prominently featured rock, jazz and R&B; music (Paul Simon, Patti Smith, Joe Cocker, Jimmy Cliff, Leon Redbone, Carly Simon, Esther Phillips, Phoebe Snow ETC.)But the real draw was the supporting cast, that went on to become stars in their own right. Out of all the talent to come across the NBC 8H stage, that original cast of Dan Aykryod, Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Laraine Newman, Garrett Morris and Gilda Radner (and lets not forget Bill Murray, who eventually joined them) truely had a special comic chemistry, that I don't think has ever beeen replicated.Now, the entire first season has been released to the DVD format. Each episode clocks in around the 66 minute mark. The remastering of the picture & sound is wonderful. Its hard to believe this comes from video tape, that is over thirty years old. It also appears that Producer Lorne Michaels has gotten most of those pesky music clearences, that seem to bedevil many older TV shows going to DVD these days. If I had but one complaint, it is that they removed the show's color tinted photos, that use to signify a commercial break. It's shame those celebrity photos are missing, because they truely were part of the show's look and character.Nobody is going to argue that every single show is a classic (certainly not the Rob Reiner episode). But the vast majority of them will give most viewers some big belly laughs and even a sense of nostalgia. If you are a fan of SNL or just good comedy in general, then highly recommend the DVD box set ""Saturday Night Live: The Complete First Season"".",5,"""It's a Floor Wax...No It's a Desert Topping!!""",1178064000,"05 2, 2007",2007,2868,"['When', 'found', 'out', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'was', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'beside', 'excitement', 'Why', 'have', 'great', 'memories', 'growing', 'up', 'hilarious', 'revolutionary', 'show', 'very', 'early', 'years.I', 'was', '13', 'years', 'old', 'pretty', 'much', 'spent', 'boring', 'weekend', 'nights', 'babysitting', 'extra', 'cash', 'kids', 'sat', 'forced', 'sit', 'endless', 'torturous', 'hours', 'Love', 'Boat', 'Fantasy', 'Island', 'Ugghh', ""'m"", 'still', 'having', 'Charo', 'flashbacks', 'once', 'kiddies', 'went', 'bed', '11:30', 'PM', 'rolled', 'around', 'something', 'magical', 'exciting', 'seemed', 'finally', 'happen', 'tube', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'was', 'TV', 'show', 'seemed', 'hip', 'super', 'cool', 'club', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'be', 'part', 'fact', 'was', 'being', 'broadcast', 'live', 'seemed', 'give', 'almost', 'dangerous', 'quality', 'humour', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'lots', 'references', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'Hardly', 'stuff', 'middle', 'aged', 'parents', 'found', 'remotely', 'funny', 'truely', 'was', 'first', 'network', 'TV', 'show', 'brought', 'babyboom', 'generation', 'who', 'had', 'grown', 'up', 'television.The', 'guest', 'hosts', 'were', 'celebrities', 'did', ""n't"", 'ordinarily', 'see', 'often', 'network', 'television', 'Elliot', 'Gould', 'George', 'Carlin', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'ETC.', 'same', 'went', 'musical', 'acts', 'prominently', 'featured', 'rock', 'jazz', 'R', 'B', 'music', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'Joe', 'Cocker', 'Jimmy', 'Cliff', 'Leon', 'Redbone', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'Esther', 'Phillips', 'Phoebe', 'Snow', 'ETC', 'real', 'draw', 'was', 'supporting', 'cast', 'went', 'become', 'stars', 'own', 'right', 'talent', 'come', 'NBC', '8H', 'stage', 'original', 'cast', 'Dan', 'Aykryod', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'John', 'Belushi', 'Laraine', 'Newman', 'Garrett', 'Morris', 'Gilda', 'Radner', 'not', 'forget', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'who', 'eventually', 'joined', 'truely', 'had', 'special', 'comic', 'chemistry', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'beeen', 'replicated.Now', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'format', 'episode', 'clocks', '66', 'minute', 'mark', 'remastering', 'picture', 'sound', 'wonderful', 'hard', 'believe', 'video', 'tape', 'thirty', 'years', 'old', 'also', 'Producer', 'Lorne', 'Michaels', 'gotten', 'most', 'pesky', 'music', 'clearences', 'seem', 'bedevil', 'many', 'older', 'TV', 'shows', 'going', 'DVD', 'days', 'had', 'one', 'complaint', 'removed', 'show', 'color', 'tinted', 'photos', 'use', 'signify', 'commercial', 'break', 'shame', 'celebrity', 'photos', 'are', 'missing', 'truely', 'were', 'part', 'show', 'look', 'character.Nobody', 'going', 'argue', 'single', 'show', 'classic', 'certainly', 'not', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'episode', 'vast', 'majority', 'will', 'give', 'most', 'viewers', 'big', 'belly', 'even', 'sense', 'nostalgia', 'are', 'fan', 'SNL', 'just', 'good', 'comedy', 'general', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season']",N/A

I saw most of these as a kid, but watching them now in light of their legendary status only highlights how much memory can be obscured by nostalgia.MAYBE one in three skits is funny here, and the other two are usually painful. If ever there was a case for a best-of tape, this is it. You could fit all the truly funny stuff on two discs, max. The nostalgia factor is high; it's great to see Steve Martin, Belushi, Aykroyd, Carlin, etc etc in their prime...but man, they did a lot of UNfunny stuff here too!By disc two we were looking at each other and saying, ""We thought this was funny back then?""Well, we were kids.Now that I'm all grown up, almost, this first season falls flat most of the time. It's painfully weak at points, and you start asking yourself, how many more discs do I have to sit through?Nice as a nostalgia trip, but kind of disturbing in that it makes you question how much of what you remember as great from your early years is really just crap seen through the rose-colored lens of time.Yes, the good stuff is occasionally brilliant (the final Star Trek episode stands out as still hilarious), and it was ground-breaking in its era. Now, however, much of it just seems lame and childish.  Unless you have 20 hours to waste, just watch the best-ofs. I kept expecting to see some old gem of a skit I'd missed or forgotten; I think I saw 30 minutes' worth at most. The Muppet skits are almost complete drivel, nothing like their later show.I have much higher hopes for the Bill Murray seasons.

It proves that any sufficiently long-running TV show, no matter how frivolous in its nature, ultimately becomes a kind of saga in which early episodes inevitably foreshadow later events, whether in the TV show itself or in culture in general.  To name just one example, when Simon and Garfunkel sing ""The Boxer"" in Episode 2, one cannot help remembering that Paul Simon would sing that song again twenty-six years later on the first SNL after 9/11.Is ""The Complete First Season"" funny?  Yes, it is -- obviously not continuously or perfectly funny, perhaps not even as funny as ""The Complete Twelfth Season"" (Dana Carvey's first) would be, but funny enough to keep me laughing aloud throughout the 66 minutes of each of the 24 episodes (with the obvious exception of Episode 2, the mostly-music presentation hosted by Paul Simon -- probably the only SNL episode ever that can be described as ""tranquil"" and ""calming"").But what makes this set most special to me is the patina of irony and poignancy that these episodes have acquired over the years.  There are so many moments that now carry far more significance than they would have in 1975-1976.  Some such moments are hilarious (an ad for a ""Triple-Trak"" razor as a piece of satire).  Some are bittersweet (John and Gilda's unforgettable, totally wordless ""Laundromat"" sketch).  Some are so tragic in retrospect that they are hard to watch -- most of all, Emily Litella declaring that cancer research is ""very necessary"".I strongly recommend that viewers take the time to watch all of these episodes in broadcast order, to see the series' familiar format develop and to understand how the American public gradually came to know these seven unknown performers.  (At the end of ""Citizen Kane II"", when the actors' names appear on screen in a parody of ""Citizen Kane""'s closing credits, I realized with a shock that that would have been the first time many viewers found out which one was Belushi and which one was Aykroyd.)

1027702,A1X1UZWUIDHCJ5,B000JLQPYK,Marc Harshbarger,"[3, 3]","I never thought entire seasons of ""Saturday Night Live"" would ever be released on DVD.  Never in a million years.  Never in my wildest dreams. But lo and behold, here it is.  And all I can say is ""Wow"".I don't think I began watching SNL on a regular basis until its second season when Bill Murray joined the show and The Coneheads first appeared and Steve Martin began hosting.  So it was fascinating for me to watch the show's first season in order to see the transformation of this landmark series.  The first few episodes aren't that great or funny.  The Not Ready for Prime Time Players weren't allowed to really shine until around the fourth episode when Candice Bergen hosted.  And the second show with Paul Simon as host is almost all music--which isn't bad--but it's not the SNL we came to know and love.  But slowly as the season evolved, the original cast became stars and the main reason to tune in.Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman and Gilda Radner took over SNL and made it their own during the first season.  They developed classic characters such as Gilda's Emily Litella and Baba Wawa (Barbara Walters), Chevy's accident-prone President Ford, Land Shark (a spoof of the popular ""Jaws"") and his smooth Weekend Update newscaster, Dan's Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon, and John's Japanese Samurai, plus The Bees.  Even The Muppets showed up during the first season, but they were eventually phased out as the cast became more popular--and their humor didn't really fit the show that well (and it was all for the best, since The Muppets then went on to create their own popular show, ""The Muppet Show"").I confess I haven't watched SNL much since the days of Eddie Murphy and The Sweeney Sisters (Nora Dunn and Jan Hooks).  After they all left, so did I.  But I think it's amazing that the show is still on the air after all these years.  That's what makes this first season so special--to see the roots of such a legendary show.  I loved the eclectic mix of guest hosts--Rob Reiner, Candice Bergen, Lily Tomlin, Richard Pryor, Elliott Gould, Buck Henry, Dick Cavett, Desi Arnaz (who is wonderful), Jill Clayburgh, Anthony Perkins, Raquel Welch, Madeline Kahn, Dyan Cannon and Louise Lasser--and the musical guests are just as diverse: Janis Ian, Simon & Garfunkel, Abba, Anne Murray, Neil Sedaka, Patti Smith Group, Carly Simon, Gordon Lightfoot, Loudon Wainwright III (Rufus' father) and Rita Coolidge.  Wow.  I have to say that again.  Wow.  And again.Also, this DVD set includes some interesting extras: the original screen tests for the cast and an interview with the cast and producer Lorne Michaels on NBC's ""Tomorrow Show"" starring Tom Snyder just before the first episode aired.If you want to watch a groundbreaking show become a force of nature, here's where it all began.  Right here--on this DVD set.  And be sure to watch the episodes in order.  It's a fascinating journey.",5,If only I could give this DVD set 10 stars . . .,1201132800,"01 24, 2008",2008,2947,"['never', 'thought', 'entire', 'seasons', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'Never', 'million', 'years', 'Never', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'lo', 'behold', 'here', 'can', 'say', 'Wow', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'began', 'watching', 'SNL', 'regular', 'basis', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'joined', 'show', 'Coneheads', 'first', 'appeared', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'began', 'hosting', 'was', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'order', 'see', 'transformation', 'landmark', 'series', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'funny', 'Not', 'Ready', 'Prime', 'Time', 'Players', 'were', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'really', 'shine', 'fourth', 'episode', 'when', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'hosted', 'second', 'show', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'host', 'almost', 'music', ""n't"", 'bad', 'not', 'SNL', 'came', 'know', 'love', 'slowly', 'season', 'evolved', 'original', 'cast', 'became', 'stars', 'main', 'reason', 'tune', 'in.Dan', 'Aykroyd', 'John', 'Belushi', 'Jane', 'Curtin', 'Garrett', 'Morris', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Laraine', 'Newman', 'Gilda', 'Radner', 'took', 'over', 'SNL', 'made', 'own', 'first', 'season', 'developed', 'classic', 'characters', 'such', 'Gilda', 'Emily', 'Litella', 'Baba', 'Wawa', 'Barbara', 'Walters', 'Chevy', 'accident-prone', 'President', 'Ford', 'Land', 'Shark', 'spoof', 'popular', 'Jaws', 'smooth', 'Weekend', 'Update', 'newscaster', 'Dan', 'Jimmy', 'Carter', 'Richard', 'Nixon', 'John', 'Japanese', 'Samurai', 'Bees', 'Even', 'Muppets', 'showed', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'were', 'eventually', 'phased', 'out', 'cast', 'became', 'more', 'popular', 'humor', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'fit', 'show', 'well', 'was', 'best', 'Muppets', 'then', 'went', 'create', 'own', 'popular', 'show', 'Muppet', 'Show', '.I', 'confess', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'SNL', 'much', 'days', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Sweeney', 'Sisters', 'Nora', 'Dunn', 'Jan', 'Hooks', 'left', 'did', 'think', 'amazing', 'show', 'still', 'air', 'years', 'what', 'first', 'season', 'so', 'special', 'see', 'roots', 'such', 'legendary', 'show', 'loved', 'eclectic', 'mix', 'guest', 'hosts', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'Lily', 'Tomlin', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'Buck', 'Henry', 'Dick', 'Cavett', 'Desi', 'Arnaz', 'who', 'wonderful', 'Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'Anthony', 'Perkins', 'Raquel', 'Welch', 'Madeline', 'Kahn', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', 'Louise', 'Lasser', 'musical', 'guests', 'are', 'just', 'diverse', 'Janis', 'Ian', 'Simon', 'Garfunkel', 'Abba', 'Anne', 'Murray', 'Neil', 'Sedaka', 'Patti', 'Smith', 'Group', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'Gordon', 'Lightfoot', 'Loudon', 'Wainwright', 'III', 'Rufus', 'father', 'Rita', 'Coolidge', 'Wow', 'have', 'say', 'again', 'Wow', 'again.Also', 'DVD', 'set', 'interesting', 'extras', 'original', 'screen', 'tests', 'cast', 'interview', 'cast', 'producer', 'Lorne', 'Michaels', 'NBC', 'Tomorrow', 'Show', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Snyder', 'just', 'first', 'episode', 'aired.If', 'want', 'watch', 'groundbreaking', 'show', 'become', 'force', 'nature', 'here', 'where', 'began', 'Right', 'here', 'DVD', 'set', 'be', 'sure', 'watch', 'episodes', 'order', 'fascinating', 'journey']",N/A

Mular,"[89, 91]","I must say that it is absolutely great that we can finally see the shows as they were originally broadcast (minus the 25 minutes of commercials that I hated sitting through).  This is SNL in its prime.  In seeing these uncut shows, you will see just how good the original cast was.  Just one show from this season is better than any yearly ""Best Of"" they can put together from the current cast.THE DOWN SIDE: There has been little effort made to restore the 30+ year old videotapes.  The picture is often soft with color bleeding to the right of objects on screen. This is not the original way we saw the series live, so some restoration would have been nice.  Other shows have gotten better DVD treatment.WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW if you never saw the first season live:1) Take away the 25 minutes of commercials and these ""90 Minute"" shows only run 65 minutes.2) In those days the show was NOT called ""Saturday Night Live"", that title was used by sportscaster Howard Cosell for his weekly live vartiety show seen at 9pm, Saturday Nights on the ABC Network.  This show's first season was officially called ""NBC's Saturday Night"" and introduced as ""Live from New York, it's NBC's Saturday Night"".  These original titles were later re-shot as just ""Saturday Night"" for the hour long syndication run, and ""The Best Of Saturday Night Live"" for the later cut-down half hour syndication run.3) While the first show seems to be a in the regular sketch format, the second show is more of a Paul Simon Special with Chevy Chase making a brief appearance to introduce the show, and later to do a ""Weekend Update"".  The ""Not Ready For Prime Time Players"" make brief appearances in filmed segments.  The third show returns to the familiar sketch format, but the end credits roll over a slide of the guest star rather than have everyone waving ""by"" on stage.  It is apparent that NBC was still finding the style & format for the show.4) Season 1 was the only season with Chevy Chase as a regular, after that he would appear as a guest star.5) Bill Murray was not a regular in the first season.",4,"Restored to original format & titles, but no technical restoration.",1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,2075,"['must', 'say', 'absolutely', 'great', 'can', 'finally', 'see', 'shows', 'were', 'originally', 'broadcast', '25', 'minutes', 'commercials', 'hated', 'sitting', 'SNL', 'prime', 'seeing', 'uncut', 'shows', 'will', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'original', 'cast', 'was', 'Just', 'one', 'show', 'season', 'better', 'yearly', 'Best', 'can', 'put', 'together', 'current', 'cast.THE', 'DOWN', 'SIDE', 'been', 'little', 'effort', 'made', 'restore', '30+', 'year', 'old', 'videotapes', 'picture', 'often', 'soft', 'color', 'bleeding', 'right', 'objects', 'screen', 'not', 'original', 'way', 'saw', 'series', 'live', 'so', 'restoration', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'Other', 'shows', 'have', 'gotten', 'better', 'DVD', 'YOU', 'SHOULD', 'KNOW', 'never', 'saw', 'first', 'season', 'live:1', 'Take', 'away', '25', 'minutes', 'commercials', '90', 'Minute', 'only', 'run', '65', 'minutes.2', 'days', 'show', 'was', 'NOT', 'called', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'title', 'was', 'used', 'sportscaster', 'Howard', 'Cosell', 'weekly', 'live', 'vartiety', 'show', 'seen', '9pm', 'Saturday', 'Nights', 'ABC', 'Network', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'officially', 'called', 'NBC', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'introduced', 'Live', 'New', 'York', 'NBC', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'original', 'titles', 'were', 'later', 're-shot', 'just', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'hour', 'long', 'syndication', 'run', 'Best', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Live', 'later', 'cut-down', 'half', 'hour', 'syndication', 'run.3', 'first', 'show', 'be', 'regular', 'sketch', 'format', 'second', 'show', 'more', 'Paul', 'Simon', 'Special', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'making', 'brief', 'appearance', 'introduce', 'show', 'later', 'do', 'Weekend', 'Update', 'Not', 'Ready', 'Prime', 'Time', 'Players', 'make', 'brief', 'appearances', 'filmed', 'segments', 'third', 'show', 'returns', 'familiar', 'sketch', 'format', 'end', 'roll', 'slide', 'guest', 'star', 'rather', 'have', 'everyone', 'waving', 'stage', 'apparent', 'NBC', 'was', 'still', 'finding', 'style', 'format', 'show.4', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'only', 'season', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'regular', 'would', 'appear', 'guest', 'star.5', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'was', 'not', 'regular', 'first', 'season']",N/A

A lot of the sketches could never get past the censors today because of political correctness and corporate sensitivities.Along with all of the timeless goofy situation humor, the cast, writers, and producer poked fun at their own network, delivered plenty of below-the-belt political satire, gave Cheech & Chong a run for their money at drug humor, dabbled with some occasionally dicey racial humor, and even made comic sport of a pedophile (Buck Henry's ""Uncle Roy,"" who doesn't show up until Season 4).Some of the humor may not translate smoothly to the more cautiousworld of today.  All I can say is, you had to be there.Regardless of the level of celebrity they had obtained, the musical guests were always first-rate.

Make a movie""","[15, 16]","Looking back on stand-up comedy, sketch comedy, and even improv comedy, as they exist today, there is no doubt where the dividing line is drawn, separating the ""current"" from everything that came before it.  The first season of SNL is that dividing line.  This is the first time the Baby Boomers, the Sixties Kids, the people that were handed a Golden Plastic Suburban Society and rejected it wholesale, were given control of a show.  Fortunately, at that time, light night TV was a wasteland, a virtual graveyard of test patterns, or, if an insomniac was lucky, old black and white movies.  The ""suits"" weren't paying attention to what the ""kids"" were doing with their airwaves at 11:30 on a Saturday.  At the time, hard-to-believe as it may be, there was no cable, no satellite, and no internet.  SNL was the first time America at large got a look at anything even close to subversive on the airwaves.Of course, even SNL didn't come out of nowhere.  Even SNL had influences, the biggest two of which were Monty Python's Flying Circus (for its looney, jovial anarchy), and the early National Lampoon magazine empire(for its looney, drug-addled anarchy).  SNL and that golden original cast didn't exactly invent comedy, they just were given the perfect platform to take over the position of most influential purveyors of comedy on the pop culture landscape.And what a cast it was!  The smarmy WASP banter of Chevy Chase, the lovably spastic wailings of Gilda Radner, the various sleazy characters personified by Dan Ackroyd, and the manic blustery energy brought to the stage by Belushi.  It is true that the first season will be a shock to many; the format was not quite yet established and was more of a variety show.  It wasn't even called Saturday Night Live!  It was called NBC's Satruday Night, since there was another show (a variety show of the traditional stripe) on ABC called Saturday Night Live that was hosted by (get ready) Howard Cosell!  So this first season might be shocking to some (younger) viewers; but you can see the potential for greatness there, right from the first sketch, which honestly, is a bit of a rip-off of the Monty Python ""Hungarian phrasebook"" sketch.  But soon enough, the cast members found their own notes and bits, they fired The Muppets, and the legend was born for the rest of the Scary 70's.SNL has been a good companion over the years.  I saw that first show when it originally aired, at age nine (I sneaked my viewing in my bedroom with the covers over my head), and have always come back to it time and again, even if I didn't see every single show.Even the worst shows SNL ever did provide entertainment, or comedy, be it intentional or not.  Going back and looking at the full shows at this late date will allow the viewer to realize that not everything the original cast did back then was gold.  They did bomb out from time to time with unfunny material; it's just the funny stuff that gets remembered in the haze of golden nostalgia.  But still, it's great to have it all, funny, not funny, the whole ball of wax, even the musical guests, available to pull off the shelf at a whim.

This is a time capsule back to when the show had a punk rock/ underground edge. There are clever references to drugs, sex and politics during a turbulent era in American culture. Alot of the jokes backfire and its apart of the beauty of the show. Its live and all of the blemishes are out in the open. I only wish there was more spontaneity in modern entertainment.The current incarnation of SNL suffers from predictability and one-dimension of humor. Here we have slapstick, serio-comedy, vaudeville, politcal satire, etc. The hosts actually had an impact on the tone and style of each episode. Richard Pryor, Madeline Kahn and Peter Cook/Dudley Moore are stand-outs. One can't overlook the magic of the ""Not Ready for Primetime Players."" Gilda and John have a familiar charm that is world famous, but they are my least favorite performers (Emily LaTella and Baba Wawa are one-joke characters would shouldn't have lasted longer than this season. Ugh). But now, as the show has aged, you can admire the subtle talents of people like Laraine Newman, Garrett Morris and Michael O'Donoghue. Each cast member brings a unique energy to the sketch. And I have to defend the star power of Chevy Chase who's Weekend Update and his occasional slapstick genius elevated the show. Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin are the most consistent performers and would remain so for years.I actually enjoy the ""clunker"" skits and the ""boring"" short films. I appreciate the different rhythms in these early episodes.  But the Muppets blow. But the No. 1 thing I love about early SNL is the broad, clever concepts behind the sketches. This was before the recurring characters and catchphrases dominated Lorne Michaels' vision. No polish, fearless topics and inspired performances.

The series was originally touted as a comedy/variety show (rather than a sketch comedy series). Today's viewers may find the amount of music surprising, but it was an essential part of the show. For a lot of people at the time, the rock music was the main attraction.Yes, it all looks very 1970s, and yes, the topical jokes are now dated. But, of course, it WAS the '70s, so that's to be expected.There are a few good episodes here, including a great early one hosted by Lily Tomlin and a fun broadcast hosted by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. Also of interest is the show hosted by White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen (with some classic skits and with brief filmed appearances by President Ford).These DVDs are, however, a mixed bag as entertainment. There are memorable skits, but also a lot of humor that falls flat (especially some of the Albert Brooks films and anything involving people in bee costumes). Still, I'm having a great time watching even the weaker programs. The quality of the comedy improves as the season progresses.My main complaint is the picture quality, which is rather smeary and suffers significant loss of color detail on a lot of the episodes.Among other issues, there's major ""crushing"" of the darker colors, with people's hair and dark clothing occasionally disappearing into the background. There are also image distortions and far too many cases of juddery movement (which are surely the result of poor DVD authoring rather than flaws on the source tape).

Sometimes. Funny? Sometimes. Certainly, more than most of the casts in the show's history.The fact of the matter is, Saturday Night Live has always been a crapshoot, no matter who is in the cast. For each episode some sketches might work, most will not. Some shows, nothing works. Some seasons, few things worked.For the original cast of Saturday Night Live, what exists is a propaganda effect shaped by the many, many best-of collections over the years. People seem to have the idea that EVERYTHING the original cast did was great. Everything was classic, every episode.Boy, are those people going to be disappointed. These episodes have many bad sketches, unfunny moments, bad musical guests and just bad episodes like all of the other years of Saturday Night Live have had.It's good to see this box set come out, though. It's an important chapter in the history of television. Sure, there are lots of laughs here, classic moments and great musical guests.

The first five seasons have remained something of a hidden treasure for manuy years now, leaving us fans of the show with only various best of shows, and ""featured player"" specials.There was a very very short period about five or six years ago, when NBC would air these classic episodes in full 90 minute format, in the middle of the night, around 2:00am. I used to force myself to stay awake for these, but then they stopped airing them in favor of the 86-90 cast shows, and then even the pretty lame 1985 season, and then we never saw these originals again. AHHHHH!Well, finally Lorne Michaels is giving us salvating dogs a little bit of something to chew on. The complete first season has every show, in its entirety, along with tons of bonus material.I love seeing how this show evolved over time, and to get this first season is a real treat. You get the original Weekend Update anchor Chevy Chase (his only season as..) along with other legends John Belushi, Dan Akroyd, Garret Morris, Gilda Radner, etc. No Bill Murray though, he didn't join until season two, oh well... keep your fingers crossed. Hopefully this thing will expand into the other seasons, theres so many great ones!The best is watching the original hosts. Once upon a time, the hosts wrote their own monolouges! George Carlin walks out and sets the bar for every other to follow ever! Awesome!... You WANT this DVD.",5,THE ONES YOU NEVER SEE.....
