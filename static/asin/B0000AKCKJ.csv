763924,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B0000AKCKJ,A Customer,"[1, 2]","Summary:Bruce Nolan (Jim Carey) is a TV reporter who is up against Evan Baxter (Steve Keller) for an anchor position that is opening up at his news station. When Bruce finds out he doesn't get the job, he makes a fool of himself berating Evan on live TV and is fired. This leads Bruce to rant against God, who happens to be listening, In order to teach Bruce a lesson about how hard it is to be God, the ""Big Guy Upstairs"" (Morgan Freeman) endows him with all of his Divine Powers. Immediately things begin to change, not only for Bruce, but for the rest of the world as well.Ironically, his powers are great enough to get his dream job, but they aren't enough to keep his girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Anniston). `Cause even God can't mess with free will. Eventually, Bruce recognizes that playing God isn't as easy as it sounds and that giving everyone what they want has some undesired consequences. The movie concludes with a predictable happy ending where Bruce straightens things out with Grace and Evan and returns the power back over to the man upstairs.My Comments:This does not rank among the best comedies I've seen. The jokes were too cheesy to deserve a belly laugh. Instead they received only an occasional chuckle from my friend and a couple of silent laughs from me. The allusions to religious miracles were somewhat forced. For example parting a bowl of red tomato soup and walking on water, were all really more silly than funny. Although I was not offended by the constant mockery of religion I didn't find it all that funny either.As far as the story goes, it was a creative premise. The story is light and although the basic story line is predictable, the movie is entertaining.Although this is not one of Jim Carey's best movies, the acting was OK. I can't really think of anyone that was absolutely terrible or anyone that deserves an Oscar nomination.This film is worth watching once, but it definitely doesn't fall into the group of classic comedies that you quote at parties with your friends. I'd recommend this movie for those who appreciate cheesy comedies like `Dumb and Dumber' or `Ace Ventura'. I don't expect it to become a cult classic like `Monty Python and the Holy Grail'.",2,Jim Carey is losing his comedic edge,1069977600,"11 28, 2003",2003,2207,"['Summary', 'Bruce', 'Nolan', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'TV', 'reporter', 'who', 'up', 'Evan', 'Baxter', 'Steve', 'Keller', 'anchor', 'position', 'opening', 'up', 'news', 'station', 'When', 'Bruce', 'out', ""n't"", 'get', 'job', 'fool', 'berating', 'Evan', 'live', 'TV', 'fired', 'Bruce', 'rant', 'God', 'who', 'be', 'listening', 'order', 'teach', 'Bruce', 'lesson', 'how', 'hard', 'be', 'God', 'Big', 'Guy', 'Upstairs', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Divine', 'Powers', 'Immediately', 'things', 'begin', 'change', 'not', 'only', 'Bruce', 'rest', 'world', 'well.Ironically', 'powers', 'are', 'great', 'enough', 'get', 'dream', 'job', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'keep', 'girlfriend', 'Grace', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'Cause', 'even', 'God', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mess', 'free', 'will', 'Eventually', 'Bruce', 'playing', 'God', ""n't"", 'as', 'easy', 'giving', 'everyone', 'what', 'want', 'undesired', 'consequences', 'movie', 'predictable', 'happy', 'ending', 'where', 'Bruce', 'things', 'out', 'Grace', 'Evan', 'power', 'back', 'man', 'upstairs.My', 'Comments', 'not', 'rank', 'best', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'jokes', 'were', 'too', 'cheesy', 'deserve', 'belly', 'laugh', 'Instead', 'received', 'only', 'occasional', 'chuckle', 'friend', 'couple', 'silent', 'laughs', 'allusions', 'religious', 'miracles', 'were', 'somewhat', 'forced', 'example', 'parting', 'bowl', 'red', 'tomato', 'soup', 'walking', 'water', 'were', 'really', 'more', 'silly', 'funny', 'was', 'not', 'offended', 'constant', 'mockery', 'religion', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'funny', 'either.As', 'far', 'story', 'was', 'creative', 'premise', 'story', 'light', 'basic', 'story', 'line', 'predictable', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'best', 'movies', 'acting', 'was', 'OK', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'anyone', 'was', 'absolutely', 'terrible', 'anyone', 'Oscar', 'nomination.This', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'fall', 'group', 'classic', 'comedies', 'quote', 'parties', 'friends', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'appreciate', 'cheesy', 'comedies', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'Monty', 'Python', 'Holy', 'Grail']",N/A

763926,A2HUU0YW6HNNQE,B0000AKCKJ,"A.F. ""musicfan585""","[1, 1]","After starring in two duds - the lackluster ME, MYSELF & IRENE and the awful sentimental tripe THE MAJESTIC - Jim Carrey is back in top comedic form and better than ever before in BRUCE ALMIGHTY.  Although the film is far from perfect (the last 20 minutes are really bad), it's Carrey's funniest movie since LIAR LIAR, which is still his best comedy to date, and the hilarity of some of the standout scenes alone are worth the price of admission.Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter for Channel 7 news in Buffalo who is sick and tired of doing second-rate stories and wants to become the head male anchor at the network.  Bruce always never liked his life and even moreso on this day.  During the 24 hours, he loses his dream anchor job to a slimy rival named Evan(Steve Carrell), gets jumped by a Mexican gang, crashes his car, and his dog constantly pees on his furniture.  His only source for comfort is his live-in girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston), but even Bruce lashes out on her about his/their ""mediocre life.""  Bruce then lashes out at God, claiming that He is the source for all his problems.Then the next day, God himself (in the form of Morgan Freeman) calls Bruce and has a meeting with him in an abandoned building.  God gives Bruce his almighty powers while He goes on vacation, daring him to do a better job than he does.  Bruce agrees, but like any human being, he uses his powers to get back at his enemies and get everything he wants.  Of course, he soon learns that being God isn't all it's cracked up to be...The premise of the movie is very clever.  What if you were to play God for a week?  That is what anybody wishes to be.  The funniest scenes in the film occur during the first hour, which is consistently funny throughout.  The scene where Bruce gets back at Evan while live on the air is hysterical, and the running joke involving the dog using the toilet is very funny as well. But the most hilarious scene is when Bruce, finding out that Evan got the anchor position while live at Niagara Falls, goes out on a tangent and unleashes his fury on TV.  He ends his rant on a profane note, and it perfectly showcases what Carrey is capable of.For the most part the movie is funny, but the film stops dead in its tracks during the last 20 minutes or so, which is slow, dull, and painfully sentimental.  The director of this movie also directed PATCH ADAMS, which is one of the worst movies ever made and you all know how ""weepy"" that was.  The end of BRUCE ALMIGHTY definitely reaches those levels and instead of delivering their message on a positive note, they went the corny direction (which is why I took one star off).  That's my only real complaint.  Everyone else is good.  Morgan Freeman is very funny as God and has a couple of great one-liners and Jennifer Aniston is a sweetheart, not to mention Steve Carrell who is the perfect foil for Carrey and his mannerisms.BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a nicely done comedy and one of the few Hollywood comedies out there that's actually funny.

The people looking for the usual Jim Carrey humor will not be dissapointed, as he gets to let loose in afew scenes and remind us why he is one of the more sucessful comedians in film of all time. The audience looking for a comedy with a good message and something their kids can see won't be dissapoined either. While this film does have some adult humor, it is still a good movie for kids to see. Jim Carrey is very funny, although he has been more funny, in films like Liar Liar and Dumb and Dumber. It's not his fault as much as it is he shares the spotlight with other people and acts more serious at the end. Morgan Freeman is the first actor to nail the role of God, as he just reflectss wisdom and grace. Jennifer Aniston also does surprisingly well as Bruce's long suffering girlfriend.

763934,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0000AKCKJ,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 2]","It's been three years since we got a real Jim Carrey comedy. The last being ""Me, Myself & Irene"". While Jim tried to expand his talents with more straight films like ""The Truman Show"", ""Man On The Moon"", and ""The Majestic"", fans were starting to miss what they first fell for Jim in the first place. Comedy. This movie is a relief to those of us who have been waiting to see Jim return to comedy. However, this isn't the manic, over the top frenzy kind of comedy that made Jim famous for in the 90's with fare like ""Ace Ventura"" and ""Dumb And Dumber"". Sure,  some of the zaniness and physical aspect of it is there, but it's not as much as usual. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a field correspondent for the local Buffalo news station who usually covers the more heartwarming and human stories that normally end the newscasts. Things aren't going his way. He wants an anchor job that he eventually loses to a smarmy co-worker(Steve Carell), a dog that urinates all over the apartment, and on top of that, he gets beat up. On the upside, Bruce does have a great girlfriend named Grace, who is played by Jennifer Aniston and looks really good in this film. After Bruce's whining and complaining to God over his less than stellar life, the big man himself(played with the right amount of presence and magic by Morgan Freeman) pays Bruce a visit and offers Bruce his powers while he is on vacation. This is where the fillm starts to pick up speed and starts to let Carrey let loose and have fun. Naturally, as anyone would, Bruce lets his powers get to him and abuses them for his own purposes. When he tries to make some good in the world with his newfound abilities, well, chaos abounds. This isn't exactly an inventive idea. How many times have we seen a film where someone gets powers, or gets a second chance, or gets to trade places with somebody?. Lots of times. So, while it isn't exactly a revolutionary idea, the film rises above all others because those movies didn't have Jim Carrey. He really brings Bruce to life in the beginning of the film by making him seem like a loveable loser in a slump with life. Some say he was very unlikeable, but he was exactly the opposite. He was likeable. He was having a bad time. Not once did I not like, or feel, for the character. Carrey was able to play it with a straight face during these times, and he didn't look like he was always on the verge of a laugh or saying something funny. As some critics have stated. What was surprising, and somewhat disappointing, was how Carrey was more restrained than you would of thought. There are moments of silliness and some old Carrey schtick, but he doesn't go over the top like the good 'ol days in the 90's. His comedic performance in the film was a balance between the physical comedy of ""Liar Liar"", but with the heart and solidness of his ""The Truman Show"" era. One would of wished it had been kicked into higher gear, but it is good nonetheless. Aniston does what she can with the usual ""I've been dating this guy for 5 years and I want a wedding and kids"" girlfriend role, but she manages to bring some heart and emotion to the predictable supporting role. Morgan Freeman was a nice bit of casting as the almighty one himself. His scenes are not very long, but he really brings it and makes the most of his scenes. ""Jag"" star Catherine Bell appears in the film as well, as does character actor Phillip Baker Hall as Bruce's boss. Steve Carell as the slimy co-worker gets one of the funniest scenes in the movie by having a breakdown on the set thanks to Bruce. The extra features on the disc are a lot of fun. Some of the outtakes and deleted scenes are hilarious and you would wish that some of them had ended up in the finished product. As some other reviews had stated, the commercial ads on this disc are annoying and they don't allow you to skip through them. However, I found that if you hit 'menu' on your control, it will come up and you can get through those annoying ads. So, this film is a lot of fun and it has a really nice feeling to it. It has heart, it has emotion, and it's funny. It is a pleasant and enjoyable film to kill a few hours.

763936,A1R3SN9A7EHSYD,B0000AKCKJ,"Brandon A. Coles ""OmNyx""","[2, 3]","This movie is vintage Jim Carrey!! I laughed at almost every scene. The screenplay was structured properly and the roles were more on-point than any comedy I have ever seen. Carrey's hits include &quot;The Mask,&quot; &quot;Ace Ventura,&quot; &quot;Liar, Liar,&quot; and it seems like we're use to all the lovable characters that he creates. There is no other comic that has the ability to bring joy out of you, make you laugh out loud, and make you cry all in the same instance.One thing that will grip you is how the plot leaves you intrigued. Carrey plays the highly-spirited Bruce Nolan, a newscaster who gives the people the &quot;lighter side&quot; of news. Everyone appreciates his moral demeanor, except for himself. He has a promising relationship with his wife-to-be, Grace (played by Jennifer Aniston) and what keeps their relationship strong is how firmly she believes in him and has great faith in God. While Grace is spiritually motivated, Bruce feels as if God is &quot;picking on him&quot; because he wants the anchor job that his nemesis, Evan (played by Steve Carell) is picked to get. So when Evan gets the job, Bruce loses it during a &quot;live&quot; session and is fired from his job. He often seeks God (played by Morgan Freeman) to give him a sign and finally encounters Him. So in order to get what he wants from God, He endows Bruce with his powers to see if He can help others as well as himself any better. This movie is basically a testimony for those who have finally found a revelation and a relationship with God in the midst of their tattered life. You can also pray so much where you only want God to always meet your needs. God helps everyone.Bruce finally realizes that he must be able to forgive and put others first before himself when he and Grace briefly separate and he almost loses his life. This a delightful tale and every scene is pretty much a riot. From the Latin thugs in the alley with the monkey, to the gibberish-talking Evan scene, Bruce Almighty is a heaven-sent comedy for the ages.",4,Delightful material!!,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,2036,"['movie', 'vintage', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'laughed', 'almost', 'scene', 'screenplay', 'was', 'structured', 'properly', 'roles', 'were', 'more', 'on-point', 'comedy', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Carrey', 'hits', 'include', 'quot', 'Mask', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'quot', 'quot', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'quot', ""'re"", 'use', 'lovable', 'characters', 'other', 'comic', 'ability', 'bring', 'joy', 'make', 'loud', 'make', 'cry', 'same', 'instance.One', 'thing', 'will', 'grip', 'how', 'plot', 'intrigued', 'Carrey', 'highly-spirited', 'Bruce', 'Nolan', 'newscaster', 'who', 'people', 'quot', 'lighter', 'side', 'quot', 'news', 'Everyone', 'moral', 'demeanor', 'promising', 'relationship', 'wife-to-be', 'Grace', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'what', 'relationship', 'strong', 'how', 'firmly', 'great', 'faith', 'God', 'Grace', 'spiritually', 'motivated', 'Bruce', 'God', 'quot', 'picking', 'quot', 'anchor', 'job', 'nemesis', 'Evan', 'played', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'picked', 'get', 'So', 'when', 'Evan', 'job', 'Bruce', 'quot', 'quot', 'session', 'fired', 'job', 'often', 'God', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'give', 'sign', 'finally', 'Him', 'So', 'order', 'get', 'what', 'God', 'Bruce', 'powers', 'see', 'can', 'help', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'better', 'movie', 'basically', 'testimony', 'who', 'have', 'finally', 'found', 'revelation', 'relationship', 'God', 'midst', 'tattered', 'life', 'can', 'also', 'pray', 'so', 'much', 'where', 'only', 'want', 'God', 'always', 'meet', 'needs', 'God', 'everyone.Bruce', 'finally', 'must', 'be', 'able', 'forgive', 'put', 'others', 'first', 'when', 'Grace', 'briefly', 'separate', 'almost', 'life', 'delightful', 'tale', 'scene', 'pretty', 'much', 'riot', 'Latin', 'thugs', 'alley', 'monkey', 'gibberish-talking', 'Evan', 'scene', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'heaven-sent', 'comedy', 'ages']",N/A

Bruce (Carrey) lives in a very nice apartment and has a very beautiful and loyal girlfriend played by the lovely (and she's getting lovelier) Jennifer Aniston. However as a news reporter, Bruce is treated with no respect and watches as his undeserving colleagues advance and get all the great positions he has always wanted.Aside from work, Bruce runs into many problems in his daily life such as wrecking his car, getting mugged while trying to help a homeless man and having a dog that goes to bathroom on his carpet. After problems begin to stack on each other Bruce takes his frustration out on the man upstairs, calling him the mean bully holding the magnifying glass over all of the ants in the world. That's when Bruce meets up with God, played by Morgan Freeman, who gives Bruce his powers for 7 days to see what it's like being God Almighty. God tells him to do what he will with his powers, but he can't mess with free will.This is when the movie begins for most people, Bruce has the powers of God and of course he goes on a wacky rampage of revenge and seeing what all his powers can do. This is when Carrey gets to shine. For me, this is where the movie ends. For years, ever since Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Mask and Dumb & Dumber graced our screens, Jim Carrey has desperately tried to top his performances and has failed every time. Bruce Almighty is no exception to the rule. Yet another film tailor made for Carrey to walk around, be silly and do what he does best.In my opinion Carrey is best when he takes roles that weren't specifically made for him. From The Cable Guy, to Liar Liar to Me, Myself & Irene and now Bruce Almighty, Carrey has played the average joe down on his luck who ends up triumphing over his shortcomings in the most elaborate hijinks possible many many times. And while Carrey is no doubt a very funny man, it seems nothing he can do can ever compare to the days when he was starving to make it in Hollywood and ultimately made better choices in film roles.I admit, a part of me did really enjoy Bruce Almighty, especially once I realized how predictable the formula was going to be. Aniston does a great job playing Grace, the strong, supportive girlfriend who deserves far better than the self involved Bruce. Aniston also out performs Carrey in every way imaginable showing something Carrey doesn't know much about, subtlety. Freeman does a fantastic job playing God. If I were to pick any celebrity to be God, it'd be him. Freeman has a way of melting your heart and soothing your worries all at the same time.As for Carey, his acting skills come around toward the end when he realizes his selfish ways and decides he doesn't want to be God, but just a better man. I give this film 3 stars because it loses a star for Carrey trying way too hard as usual and another star for being way too predictable. Nothing happens in this movie that you can't guess 5 minutes into the film. But with fine performances from Aniston and Freeman, I'd say this film has been blessed.",3,"Almighty, Then...",1053648000,"05 23, 2003",2003,3147,"['Jim', 'Carrey', 'stars', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'comedy', 'average', 'man', 'who', 'down', 'luck', 'God', 'problems', 'Bruce', 'Carrey', 'very', 'nice', 'apartment', 'very', 'beautiful', 'loyal', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'lovely', 'getting', 'lovelier', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'However', 'news', 'reporter', 'Bruce', 'treated', 'respect', 'watches', 'undeserving', 'colleagues', 'advance', 'get', 'great', 'positions', 'always', 'wanted.Aside', 'work', 'Bruce', 'many', 'problems', 'daily', 'life', 'such', 'wrecking', 'car', 'getting', 'mugged', 'trying', 'help', 'homeless', 'man', 'having', 'dog', 'bathroom', 'carpet', 'problems', 'begin', 'stack', 'other', 'Bruce', 'frustration', 'man', 'calling', 'mean', 'bully', 'holding', 'magnifying', 'glass', 'ants', 'world', 'when', 'Bruce', 'up', 'God', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'Bruce', 'powers', '7', 'days', 'see', 'what', 'being', 'God', 'Almighty', 'God', 'do', 'what', 'will', 'powers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mess', 'free', 'will.This', 'when', 'movie', 'most', 'people', 'Bruce', 'powers', 'God', 'course', 'wacky', 'rampage', 'revenge', 'seeing', 'what', 'powers', 'can', 'do', 'when', 'Carrey', 'shine', 'where', 'movie', 'years', 'ever', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'Pet', 'Detective', 'Mask', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'graced', 'screens', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'desperately', 'tried', 'top', 'performances', 'failed', 'time', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'exception', 'rule', 'film', 'tailor', 'made', 'Carrey', 'walk', 'be', 'silly', 'do', 'what', 'best.In', 'opinion', 'Carrey', 'best', 'when', 'roles', 'were', ""n't"", 'specifically', 'made', 'Cable', 'Guy', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', 'now', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'Carrey', 'played', 'average', 'joe', 'down', 'luck', 'who', 'up', 'triumphing', 'shortcomings', 'most', 'elaborate', 'hijinks', 'possible', 'many', 'many', 'times', 'Carrey', 'doubt', 'very', 'funny', 'man', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'ever', 'compare', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'starving', 'make', 'Hollywood', 'ultimately', 'made', 'better', 'choices', 'film', 'roles.I', 'admit', 'part', 'did', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'especially', 'once', 'realized', 'how', 'predictable', 'formula', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Aniston', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'Grace', 'strong', 'supportive', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'far', 'better', 'self', 'involved', 'Bruce', 'Aniston', 'also', 'out', 'performs', 'Carrey', 'way', 'imaginable', 'showing', 'something', 'Carrey', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'subtlety', 'Freeman', 'fantastic', 'job', 'playing', 'God', 'were', 'pick', 'celebrity', 'be', 'God', ""'d"", 'be', 'Freeman', 'way', 'melting', 'heart', 'soothing', 'worries', 'same', 'time.As', 'Carey', 'acting', 'skills', 'come', 'around', 'end', 'when', 'selfish', 'ways', 'decides', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'God', 'just', 'better', 'man', 'give', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'star', 'Carrey', 'trying', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'usual', 'star', 'being', 'way', 'too', 'predictable', 'Nothing', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'guess', '5', 'minutes', 'film', 'fine', 'performances', 'Aniston', 'Freeman', ""'d"", 'say', 'film', 'been', 'blessed']",N/A

I am a hugh fan of Jim Carrey's and Jennifer Aniston's; however, I had somewhat low hopes for a broad comedy with a Memorial Day opening. What a great surprise!The plot is relatively simple: Carrey plays a self-absorbed TV reporter in Buffalo who dreams of being an anchor. Aniston is ""Grace,"" his long suffering girlfriend. After Carrey gets fired and complains again and again to God, he ends up being summoned by the higher power himself (Morgan Freeman). The bottom line: if Carrey thinks he can do a better job being God, then he can have the position for a few weeks.The movie follows the traditional storyline for such mass market flicks: at first Carrey puts his powers to self-serving purposes (e.g., Aniston's breasts become bigger) and then he realizes the more profound implications of being God. I won't ruin the rest of the movie.Suffice to say, there are a lot of big, broad laugh-out-loud moments throughout the film. Carrey displays his magnificent gift for physical comedy. In a series of outtakes at the end of the movie, you realize just how hard some of those scenes are to perform.This movie also has a ""deeper"" (though that might be too strong a word) message. Carrey and the audience realize that you can't give everyone everything they want for a number of reasons. And when you do one good thing for one person(Carrey pulls the moon up close for Aniston), then most likely someone else may be hurt (a tsunami hits Japan because of the change of position in the moon).One criticism: in many ways, Aniston is wasted in this role. I am a huge Aniston fan. While she is excellent, she does not have a chance to display her own formidable comedic gifts. Plus, the movie doesn't exploit the opportunity to have two such gifted comedians, Carrey and Aniston, play off each other. Both can shade their performances with darker tones. Perhaps, they can work again in a smaller, more independent film.I would recommend this film to people who enjoy big, broad comedies. It's a fun movie to go to with a date, family and/or friends.

763945,A2P49WD75WHAG5,B0000AKCKJ,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[1, 3]","Many movies that has God putting in an appearance have been dealt with on a superficial level, and most often, in intimate contact with just one person. Yes, there was James Mason's God in Heaven Can Wait opposite Warren Beatty,and Oh God with George Burns and John Denver. But let's tweak the formula and a Joan Osborne song: what if one of us became God? That's the question Bruce Almighty poses, and it pulls through with a charming, winning, and interesting take on the power of man and the power of God.Bruce Nolan, working for WKBW, the local ABC affiliate in Buffalo, is forty and having a bit of a crisis. He's in charge of hosting the cute, inoffensive segments, as seen in the opening of a small bakery that breaks the record for the largest chocolate-chip cookie. He aspires to be an anchorman and is a more than just a bit upset when Evan Baxter, an obnoxious co-worker who pokes fun at Bruce, becomes the new anchor, replacing the retiring one. This puts a strain on his relationship with girlfriend Grace, a kindergarden teacher, which becomes tumultuous later.After losing his job, he meets God, whom he has blamed for ignoring him, even shouting, ""The only one not doing his job is you!!""  To his surprise, God turns things over to Bruce and goes on holiday. Does God go on holiday, Bruce asks, to which the reply is, ""Ever hear of the Dark Ages?"" There are two conditions. One, he can't tell anyone. Two, he cannot override free will. However, Bruce uses/abuses his newly gained power for mostly personal gain, such as entertaining himself in a diner, cutting through a traffic jam, and getting even with some Latino toughs who gave him a going over after he gets fired. His getting even at Baxter during the latter's broadcast is the one scene I snickered at. It shows the inability of man to handle absolute power, but I won't mention that clich$B!&(Bhere.There are some moments that are a bit too much. One are the songs that lamely remind us what the movie is. For example, after Bruce takes over, Snap's ""I've Got The Power"" kicks in. Later, he sings Joan Osborne's ""One Of Us"", you know, as in ""What if God were..."" And at the party, we hear Mick Jagger's ""God Gave Me Everything."" OK, we get the idea.But what is this movie about, apart from Carrey's antics? I suppose it's knowing who we are, what our gifts are, but there's something else. Where does God's power end and human's begin? Also, what does a person really want? Is it what he/she wishes for in prayers? And do they pray because they feel they do not have the power and wherewithal to do it so they are waiting for that long hoped-for miracle? The fact that the movie poses these questions make this a success.I'd given up on Jim Carrey since The Truman Show, but he's confounded me again. He is great here as Bruce Nolan, balancing that goofy smile and faces of his with someone who can be nice but has a lot of growing up to do, needing to find out what he wants or what his true self is. This is the first time I've seen Jennifer Aniston in anything, and as Grace, she pulls a winning and convincing performance. However, Morgan Freeman wins hands down as a kindly, patient, fatherly God, the sort who puts an arm on your shoulder and has a chat while walking together. And it even charmed an atheist like me, so go figure.

But, as far as ""Bruce Almighty"" is concerned, Carrey's performance as a sideline reporter for a local television station is spot on. Bruce Nolan (Carrey) is one man who has all sorts of problems he cannot shake: he's the owner of a dog who isn't potty trained, and he has a job that he isn't particularly fond of. Throw in a lemon of a car no one would even think of owning, and he's not quite the envy of everyone around him; not even amongst his co-workers. The only one content with Nolan's life, is his passive wife (portrayed by Jennifer Aniston). An incident at work would change Nolan's life forever. Upon learning that a co-worker at the station (which is WKBW Channel 7 in Buffalo, New York - an actual TV station, by the way) is being promoted to the nightly news achor desk, Nolan has a hissyfit on the air during an important live interview segment, leading him to be terminated by the station. Then, nothing goes right for our hero, until, help arrives from...Guess who? ""The Lord Almighty"" (featuring Morgan Freeman in a rare ""semi-comedic"" performance), who's been watching over and observing Nolan's life forever, grants our hero enormous super powers, and the tables are suddenly turned. Nolan uses his new powers in sometimes strange and precarious ways, yet makes everything that was previously wrong, right again, and the world is suddenly a better place, right? Sometimes, as is often the case, having such control can be your personal enemy, as Nolan would soon find out. Although the comedy present in ""Bruce Almighty"" is sprinkled with a smattering of quintessential Jim Carrey nuttiness, it is the overall premise of the plot which enhances the wackiness contained within. Yes, the folks out in Hollywood have produced their share of bombastic flicks from time to time, but they have created a sheer majestical masterpiece with ""Bruce Almighty"" (even though there are some very minor blurry spots somewhere in the beginning and toward the end).

763952,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B0000AKCKJ,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[5, 9]","This innocuous film starring Jim Carrey is familiar comedic territory:  a man who doesn't appreciate what he has is given a unique means of insight.  Bruce (Carrey) is a Buffalo, New York television reporter assigned to cover all the fluff pieces despite his ambition of making it big as an anchorman.  While he loves his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Anniston), he fails to take their relationship seriously, instead concentrating on himself and his career goals.  He blames God, and not himself, for everything that has gone wrong in his life.  After an on-air breakdown, he applies for a job and instead finds himself meeting God in the kindly, sly form of Morgan Freeman.  God decides he will go on vacation and leave Bruce in charge since Bruce already believes he can do a better job.  Of course, we all know that Bruce cannot possibly have the necessary wisdom and heart, and what follows is predictable in general, humorous in the specifics.The humor in this film is not as wild nor as irreverent as Carrey's movies often are.  As a result, when Carrey tries to break loose with his familiar over-the-top style, it is jarring.  Still, there are some good, if not memorable, moments:  when Bruce discovers his new powers, when he uses them to subvert the success of his rival (a hilarious performance by Steven Carell), when he hits upon a method to organize the millions of prayers coming in.  The real problem of the script is that Bruce uses his powers for selfish means and yet never comes to that realization.  His job as God never seems to get in his way, and the trouble he causes is always in the background instead of creating obstacles his character must surmount.  As a result, Bruce's ""growth"" is predictable and shallow.  He might as well been given superpowers from the X-men instead of God.  Despite this, the pacing ensures that the viewer is swept along with the action, laughing at Bruce's antics while knowing all along what will happen.""Bruce Almighty"" delivers a few good laughs and a feel-good, unchallenging ending--exactly the type of entertainment one might want after a long day  I suggest renting instead of buying since its comedy fades as soon as the screen darkens.",3,"Cute, harmless, and mildly entertaining",1119225600,"06 20, 2005",2005,2199,"['innocuous', 'film', 'starring', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'familiar', 'comedic', 'territory', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'what', 'given', 'unique', 'means', 'insight', 'Bruce', 'Carrey', 'Buffalo', 'New', 'York', 'television', 'reporter', 'assigned', 'cover', 'fluff', 'pieces', 'ambition', 'making', 'big', 'anchorman', 'girlfriend', 'Grace', 'Jennifer', 'Anniston', 'take', 'relationship', 'seriously', 'instead', 'concentrating', 'career', 'goals', 'God', 'not', 'everything', 'gone', 'wrong', 'life', 'on-air', 'breakdown', 'job', 'instead', 'meeting', 'God', 'kindly', 'sly', 'form', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'God', 'will', 'go', 'vacation', 'leave', 'Bruce', 'charge', 'Bruce', 'already', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'course', 'know', 'Bruce', 'can', 'not', 'possibly', 'have', 'necessary', 'wisdom', 'heart', 'what', 'predictable', 'general', 'humorous', 'specifics.The', 'humor', 'film', 'not', 'wild', 'as', 'irreverent', 'Carrey', 'movies', 'often', 'are', 'result', 'when', 'Carrey', 'break', 'loose', 'familiar', 'over-the-top', 'style', 'jarring', 'Still', 'are', 'good', 'not', 'memorable', 'moments', 'when', 'Bruce', 'new', 'powers', 'when', 'subvert', 'success', 'rival', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'Steven', 'Carell', 'when', 'method', 'organize', 'millions', 'prayers', 'coming', 'real', 'problem', 'script', 'Bruce', 'powers', 'selfish', 'means', 'yet', 'never', 'realization', 'job', 'God', 'never', 'get', 'way', 'trouble', 'always', 'background', 'instead', 'creating', 'obstacles', 'character', 'must', 'surmount', 'result', 'Bruce', 'growth', 'predictable', 'shallow', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'been', 'given', 'superpowers', 'X-men', 'instead', 'God', 'pacing', 'viewer', 'swept', 'action', 'laughing', 'Bruce', 'antics', 'knowing', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'feel-good', 'unchallenging', 'ending', 'exactly', 'type', 'entertainment', 'one', 'might', 'want', 'long', 'day', 'suggest', 'renting', 'instead', 'buying', 'comedy', 'fades', 'as', 'soon', 'screen']",N/A

763955,A1OBM38R2NOIR7,B0000AKCKJ,Doris Morgan,"[2, 4]","Bruce AlmightyDirector Tom Shadyac was trying to portray faith and belief in a realistic setting.  This movie was rife with comedy, yet it told the truth about how we shape our own lives and destiny with the power of faith, belief and our own words, and whether we take responsibility for our own actions or not.  Personal faith and or belief have its ups and downs just like life depending upon the circumstances.  Life is not a rose garden; it changes and does not remain the same.Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) learnt this lesson the hard way.  He yearns for the anchor position on the News.  He was not ready for the position and yet he expected it to be given to him.  By stating that he was not ready for it, I mean that he did not want to do the work required to prepare for it.  Interestingly Bruce is like a like of so-called Christians, expecting the best that life has to offer without paying the dues required.  When things do not go his way; he whines to anyone who would listen.  He in effect created his own negative world, blamed others for it, and never took the responsibility himself for his own actions.All the aspects of God's provision were available to Bruce, but like most of us, he was blind.  He asked God for a sign and was given several, but never even noticed.When God (Morgan Freeman) gives him a chance to experience a little of what it is like to be God, Bruce delights in using the power for his own wants.  However here is where the lesson comes in.  Individual selfish, callous actions cause others to suffer.  At times like this it seems that God's grace departs from our lives, in Bruce's case it was his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) who moves herself from his personal while he learns the lesson.Later on Bruce is told by God that ""Everyone has the power to be a miracle.""  The trick is to be responsible to use it for the good of humankind and not for selfish reasons.  The ending of the movie has a surprise twist that reiterates the message.  God is within everyone (the sign holder), with the power to make changes in lives one day at a time.",5,Belief  and Words creates,1077753600,"02 26, 2004",2004,2085,"['Bruce', 'AlmightyDirector', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', 'was', 'trying', 'portray', 'faith', 'belief', 'realistic', 'setting', 'movie', 'was', 'rife', 'comedy', 'told', 'truth', 'how', 'shape', 'own', 'lives', 'destiny', 'power', 'faith', 'belief', 'own', 'words', 'take', 'responsibility', 'own', 'actions', 'not', 'Personal', 'faith', 'belief', 'have', 'ups', 'downs', 'just', 'life', 'depending', 'circumstances', 'Life', 'not', 'rose', 'garden', 'not', 'remain', 'same.Bruce', 'Nolan', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'hard', 'way', 'anchor', 'position', 'News', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'position', 'yet', 'expected', 'be', 'given', 'stating', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'mean', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'do', 'work', 'required', 'prepare', 'Interestingly', 'Bruce', 'like', 'so-called', 'Christians', 'expecting', 'best', 'life', 'offer', 'paying', 'dues', 'required', 'When', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'way', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'listen', 'effect', 'created', 'own', 'negative', 'world', 'blamed', 'others', 'never', 'took', 'responsibility', 'own', 'actions.All', 'aspects', 'God', 'provision', 'were', 'available', 'Bruce', 'most', 'was', 'blind', 'asked', 'God', 'sign', 'was', 'given', 'several', 'never', 'even', 'noticed.When', 'God', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'chance', 'experience', 'little', 'what', 'be', 'God', 'Bruce', 'delights', 'using', 'power', 'own', 'However', 'here', 'where', 'lesson', 'Individual', 'selfish', 'callous', 'actions', 'cause', 'others', 'suffer', 'times', 'God', 'grace', 'departs', 'lives', 'Bruce', 'case', 'was', 'girlfriend', 'Grace', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'who', 'personal', 'lesson.Later', 'Bruce', 'told', 'God', 'Everyone', 'power', 'be', 'miracle', 'trick', 'be', 'responsible', 'use', 'good', 'humankind', 'not', 'selfish', 'reasons', 'ending', 'movie', 'surprise', 'twist', 'message', 'God', 'everyone', 'sign', 'holder', 'power', 'make', 'changes', 'lives', 'one', 'day', 'time']",N/A

After enough complaining to God that he thinks God is rubbing his face in bad luck, Bruce gets to meet the guy himself, played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman.Bruce is then vested with God's powers because God wants to teach Bruce a few things about life.  Bruce experiments with several things of which I won't share so as not to spoil the movie.  Lessons are learned and fun is certainly had with these powers.There some very, very funny scenes here.  Some other wonderful acting played by Steve Correl from the Daily Show.  This guy is great and the perfect role for him is a competing newscaster.  I laughed out loud in many scenes in this movie!

763960,A3SGRYIICHGMX,B0000AKCKJ,Jack Turner,"[0, 0]","What would you do if felt like a loser all your life and suddenly were imbued with all the divine power of G-d?  Would you give yourself a million dollars, answer all your prayers, or just run amok.  Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty has no qualms about using is power for good...his good that is.  After accusing G-d of being asleep at the wheel, Carrey is given the chance to sit in the big mans chair.  What ensues is grand hilarity and chaos.There are, of course, many deeper lessons to this movie.  First, and foremost, G-d is not a cosmic Santa Claus who goes around granting wishes.  As we see with the scene where everyone wins the lottery because Bruce answers every prayer yes, everyone shouldn't have everything just handed to him.  Additionally, just because G-d does not answer a prayer ""yes"" does not mean he didn't answer it or that he didn't do so the right way.  The above two examples are lessons on faith and patience.  Additionally, though many conservative Christians likely will have an antagonistic opinion about the movie without ever having seen it, Morgan Freeman portrays a G-d that is pretty close to what Christian theology says about him.  For example, theology says that G-d, though being all powerful, cannot/will not do anything that violates his nature.  Since G-d allows us to have freewill, he can't force us into choosing anything, just like he can't force Bruce to be a good stand-in deity and just like Bruce can't force his girlfriend to love him.  There is a lot to find in this movie if you know where to look.Of course, all three of the main actors (Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston, and Jim Carrey) do a superb job a filling their roles.  Carrey is believable as a person who has received G-d's powers - that is, he's selfish and (hilariously) bungling.  The soundtrack was equally good, particularly the Vertical Horizon song ""You're a G-d"" when Carrey is learning to cope with his problems the normal way.  The script was obviously well thought out.

Which isn't to say it isn't funny, but it is quite recycled and doesn't pun some of the things it could and should have. Now don't get me wrong, it is anything but boring, and anything but unfunny...but it is a lot like his other projects. A funny down-on-his-luck loser (""Dumb and Dumber"") gets a supernatural power (""The Mask""), and in the end wins back the girl (""Ace Ventura"") and makes a good name for himself (""Me, Myself and Irene"").But in the same context, it is more clever and thought-provoking than his other projects.Jim Carrey plays Bruce, a generally happy, soon-to-be-married man who desperately wants to be a news reporter. Unfortunately, he ends up being fired from his job, and when this happens, he curses God. The next day his pager beeps, and Bruce calls up the number. He is given instructions on where to drive to. He follows them and ends up finding God's temporary headquarters.God is a black man (Morgan Freeman) surprisingly enough. I like Morgan Freeman, so I won't get into the racial technicalities. Anyway, God gives Bruce his powers for one week to see how well he can handle being the master of the earth, and immediately afterwards Bruce finds he has more than odd capabilities.However, much is the case with most things, Bruce finds his world also shaken by his newfound powers. He has to answer prayers, for one thing, and his relationship with Grace (Jennifer Aniston) starts to suffer due to his ever-growing greed. In the end, Bruce starts to realize it's not so easy being God.""Bruce Almighty"" is a very engaging, sweet, and harmless film, but like I said before, it is so much like Jim Carrey's other films that he seems to be making an Adam Sandler mould out of his career. One of the things I liked so much about ""Groundhog Day"" was how it showed what your average Joe would do given the power to repeat one day over and over and over again. ""Bruce Almighty"" has a very interesting and original plot, something uncommon for a comedy these days, but it unfortunately doesn't show Bruce using his newfound powers as much as he could have.But regardless, the scenes where Bruce is experimenting not only entertain you, but actually make the time fly by. I really enjoyed this movie. It isn't exactly as great as it could have been, but I don't think that was the intention. Learning from their mistakes on ""The Majestic,"" Jim Carrey (and ""Bruce Almighty's"" filmmakers) achieved their goal of making a thoroughly entertaining, if somewhat repetitive film that doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't: A Jim Carrey movie. Yes, they could have made something more interesting, dramatic, serious and hilarious, but I don't think that's what the Jim Carrey audiences want, and I think that the filmmakers are smart, in a way, for paying attention to this.",4,Almighty Then!,1056585600,"06 26, 2003",2003,2850,"['Bruce', 'Almighty', 'lot', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'other', 'projects', 'Which', ""n't"", 'say', ""n't"", 'funny', 'quite', 'recycled', ""n't"", 'pun', 'things', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'anything', 'boring', 'anything', 'unfunny', 'lot', 'other', 'projects', 'funny', 'down-on-his-luck', 'loser', 'Dumb', 'Dumber', 'supernatural', 'power', 'Mask', 'end', 'back', 'girl', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'good', 'name', 'Me', 'Myself', 'Irene', '.But', 'same', 'context', 'more', 'clever', 'thought-provoking', 'other', 'projects.Jim', 'Carrey', 'Bruce', 'generally', 'happy', 'soon-to-be-married', 'man', 'who', 'desperately', 'be', 'news', 'reporter', 'Unfortunately', 'up', 'being', 'fired', 'job', 'when', 'God', 'next', 'day', 'pager', 'beeps', 'Bruce', 'up', 'number', 'given', 'instructions', 'where', 'drive', 'up', 'finding', 'God', 'temporary', 'headquarters.God', 'black', 'man', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'surprisingly', 'enough', 'like', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'racial', 'technicalities', 'Anyway', 'God', 'Bruce', 'powers', 'one', 'week', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'can', 'handle', 'being', 'master', 'earth', 'immediately', 'afterwards', 'Bruce', 'more', 'odd', 'capabilities.However', 'much', 'case', 'most', 'things', 'Bruce', 'world', 'also', 'shaken', 'newfound', 'powers', 'answer', 'prayers', 'one', 'thing', 'relationship', 'Grace', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'suffer', 'due', 'ever-growing', 'greed', 'end', 'Bruce', 'realize', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'being', 'God', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'very', 'engaging', 'sweet', 'harmless', 'film', 'said', 'so', 'much', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'other', 'films', 'be', 'making', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'mould', 'career', 'One', 'things', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'Groundhog', 'Day', 'was', 'how', 'showed', 'what', 'average', 'Joe', 'would', 'do', 'given', 'power', 'repeat', 'one', 'day', 'over', 'again', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'very', 'interesting', 'original', 'plot', 'something', 'uncommon', 'comedy', 'days', 'unfortunately', ""n't"", 'show', 'Bruce', 'using', 'newfound', 'powers', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'have.But', 'regardless', 'scenes', 'where', 'Bruce', 'experimenting', 'not', 'only', 'entertain', 'actually', 'make', 'time', 'fly', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'as', 'great', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'intention', 'Learning', 'mistakes', 'Majestic', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'filmmakers', 'achieved', 'goal', 'making', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'repetitive', 'film', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'anything', ""n't"", 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'movie', 'Yes', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'something', 'more', 'interesting', 'dramatic', 'serious', 'hilarious', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'what', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'audiences', 'want', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'smart', 'way', 'paying', 'attention']",N/A

Credit Freeman with bringing the perfect combination of wit and warmth to his role. But I was about to walk out of the theatre at least twice. This rendition of the ""supernatural intervention to make you appreciate what you have"" script (done most recently by Nicolas Cage in ""The Family Man"", in 2000) offers nothing original.If you like Jim Carrey, you may enjoy his performance here. He really is wonderful as a struggling news feature reporter, covering fluff stories. The film falls flat because it tries to combine slapstick comedy -- in one scene, the God-like Carrey forces the news anchor to make goofy vocalizations for what seems like an interminable 2 minutes -- with religious preaching. ""It's not easy to be God."" ""People have to love of their own free will."" ""Be nice to people."" ""Think about other people before yourself.""If you already knew this, you can always giggle as Carrey gets run down by a big rig, drives his car into a light pole or (hee hee) steps in a big puddle. I'm astounded this kind of writing makes it into movies.As if all of this cliche-laden writing isn't enough, we are treated to a boy-loses-girl, boy-learns-lesson, girl forgives everything, boy-gets-girl-back happily-ever-after ending. All along, most people are going to wonder why Jennifer Anniston is living with a second-rate news reporter, why he isn't interested in her, and so on.If you're a Jim Carrey fan, none of this may matter. You will probably get a few laughs out of 'Bruce Almighty,' if for no other reason than Carrey's spastic acting style lives on here. If anyone can pull off the 'get hit by a semi' or 'step in a puddle' gags and make them work, it really is Carrey. He has some smile-inducing moments as the newsman covering a giant cookie bake and other local news-type features. But don't expect much more.I tried to like this movie, but it takes itself too seriously for what it is. In contrast, even Spielberg's 'Catch Me If You Can,' (Leondaro DiCaprio/Tom Hanks/Christopher Walken)which isn't exactly high drama, seems to bask in its lightheartedness. 'Bruce Almighty' wants to be a sermon, a cartoon and a love story all at once.

Any film that can have you holding your sides to keep the pain from becoming too intense is a good thing (and not all of the super laughs are provided by Jim Carey, to our surprise).  You should already know by now if Jim Carey's brand of humor is to your liking, especially when he is team-up again with director Tom Shadyac (""Ace Ventura"" and ""Liar, Liar"").Just do not try to work out the theological implications of the set up.  The movie, of course, makes no effort to hide the selling point of ""Bruce Almighty,"" which is that God (Morgan Freeman) gives Jim Carey (who plays a character named Bruce) divine powers.  The results are actually less spectacular than what happened in ""The Mask,"" because Bruce has a very short list of things we wants to accomplish (new car, better job, great sex).  Meanwhile, the new god on the block has no clue that his divine actions had repercussions: bringing the moon closer to earth to impress his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston, whose character also has a name in the movie that is something different from Rachel) has caused flooding on the far side of the earth, wiping out the homes of thousands of people.  The science of this makes no sense to me and the other obvious explanation, that those people flooded out in Asia were not Christians, is rather troubling.  But then so is the idea that Bruce's attitude adjustment, clearly a necessary thing, matters enough for God to allow the destruction of all those homes anyway.  After all, Bruce never really catches on that he is wrecking havoc around the world in general and Buffalo in particular and the only prayer he really listens to is one from his girlfriend.However, none of this really matters during the course of the film while you are laughing yourself silly, and you should be well out into the parking lot before you start noticing such things.  Yes, the ending seems a bit reminiscent of ""Oh, God,"" but then the problem with most really great set ups is how to end on a high note.  Besides, the ending does not come as anything approaching a surprise and ""Bruce Almighty"" is more about the journey and creating laughs than anything else.

763976,A3NZVCL9N8CLHB,B0000AKCKJ,"Logical Paradox ""Irrational, but True""","[1, 1]","Jim Carey is one of those comedic actors which you either love or hate. You'll either find him hilarious or rediculous, but whatever your take on Carey, Bruce almighty is Carey at his absolute best.Similar to &quot;Liar Liar&quot;, bruce almighty has a fanciful yet very intrigueing basis for the plot: What if you could be God? Carey plays a man named bruce, an aspiring reporter living in Buffalo NY for whom it seems life is being less than fair. Carey's acting is more adult directed in Bruce almighty as opposed to his more children targeted portrayal of Liar Liar. With some serious, though always a little on the light side, moments, carey shows how to be funny while having some deeper notes present as well. After complaining about God and asking why God doesnt fix his life, God finally answers Bruce (The main character)... by paging him of course. Bruce travels to a seemingly abandoned warehouse which also turns out to be the headquarters of the big guy himself. God, angered that bruce is critical of his work, offers Carey the job of being God to see if he can do any better, and thus we are off onto an amusing and sometimes touching ride.Morgan Freeman, does a great job playing God, and the choice to make God black is a nice little humorous touch. Bruce Almighty is packed with scenes that will just plain make you laugh out loud, the whole point of a good comedy. While sometimes being a bit silly, as most of Carey's movies tend to be, Bruce Almighty manages to do a good job balancing the good humor with the &quot;so stupid you have to laugh&quot; humor. The movie also did a great job blending in some emotional depth without having it clash with the funny stuff.Bruce's struggle to cope with his newfound powers brings some philosophical morals to the story. As God bruce is all powerful, but the catch is that he cant mess with free will - a minor but extremely complicating factor for him. After spending most of his time greedily using his powers to benefit himself, he finds himself impotent when trying to help all the scores of people praying for things, while not interfereing with free will. Once having problems with his Girl friend played by Jenifer Anistan, Bruce also finds himself powerless, as he simply cannot force her to love him.This all ads some more interesting elements and some really touching moments to the film, moments handled much better than in similar movies. The message of the movie can be sumed up when God tells Bruce that people should look to themselves instead of looking to the skies for help. And of course Bruce learns the important lesson of what really matters in life (love not carear) and that sometimes we must accept our place in the world and rise above our ego's desires to be more than that. Rarely can a comedy explore such questions without being corny and yet still managing to be funny.While I wouldnt give it a perfect 5, I have to say I liked this movie a lot, and I think most anyone will come away from Bruce almighty both with a smile and perhaps even a little enlightenment.",4,Hilarious,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",2004,3058,"['Jim', 'Carey', 'one', 'comedic', 'actors', 'either', 'love', 'hate', ""'ll"", 'either', 'find', 'hilarious', 'rediculous', 'take', 'Carey', 'Bruce', 'almighty', 'Carey', 'absolute', 'best.Similar', 'quot', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'quot', 'bruce', 'almighty', 'fanciful', 'yet', 'very', 'intrigueing', 'basis', 'plot', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'God', 'Carey', 'man', 'named', 'bruce', 'aspiring', 'reporter', 'living', 'Buffalo', 'NY', 'whom', 'life', 'being', 'less', 'fair', 'Carey', 'acting', 'more', 'adult', 'directed', 'Bruce', 'almighty', 'opposed', 'more', 'children', 'targeted', 'portrayal', 'Liar', 'Liar', 'serious', 'though', 'always', 'little', 'light', 'side', 'moments', 'carey', 'how', 'be', 'funny', 'having', 'deeper', 'notes', 'present', 'as', 'well', 'complaining', 'God', 'asking', 'why', 'God', 'fix', 'life', 'God', 'finally', 'Bruce', 'main', 'character', 'paging', 'course', 'Bruce', 'seemingly', 'abandoned', 'warehouse', 'also', 'out', 'be', 'headquarters', 'big', 'guy', 'God', 'angered', 'bruce', 'critical', 'work', 'Carey', 'job', 'being', 'God', 'see', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'thus', 'are', 'off', 'amusing', 'sometimes', 'touching', 'ride.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'God', 'choice', 'make', 'God', 'black', 'nice', 'little', 'humorous', 'touch', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'packed', 'scenes', 'will', 'just', 'plain', 'make', 'loud', 'whole', 'point', 'good', 'comedy', 'sometimes', 'being', 'bit', 'silly', 'most', 'Carey', 'movies', 'tend', 'be', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'balancing', 'good', 'humor', 'quot', 'stupid', 'have', 'laugh', 'quot', 'humor', 'movie', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'blending', 'emotional', 'depth', 'having', 'clash', 'funny', 'stuff.Bruce', 'struggle', 'cope', 'newfound', 'powers', 'philosophical', 'morals', 'story', 'God', 'bruce', 'powerful', 'catch', 'mess', 'free', 'will', 'minor', 'extremely', 'complicating', 'factor', 'spending', 'most', 'time', 'greedily', 'using', 'powers', 'benefit', 'impotent', 'when', 'trying', 'help', 'scores', 'people', 'praying', 'things', 'not', 'interfereing', 'free', 'will', 'Once', 'having', 'problems', 'Girl', 'friend', 'played', 'Jenifer', 'Anistan', 'Bruce', 'also', 'powerless', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'force', 'love', 'him.This', 'ads', 'more', 'interesting', 'elements', 'really', 'touching', 'moments', 'film', 'moments', 'handled', 'much', 'better', 'similar', 'movies', 'message', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'sumed', 'up', 'when', 'God', 'Bruce', 'people', 'should', 'look', 'instead', 'looking', 'skies', 'help', 'course', 'Bruce', 'important', 'lesson', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'life', 'not', 'carear', 'sometimes', 'must', 'accept', 'place', 'world', 'rise', 'ego', 'desires', 'be', 'more', 'Rarely', 'can', 'comedy', 'explore', 'such', 'questions', 'being', 'corny', 'yet', 'still', 'managing', 'be', 'funny.While', 'wouldnt', 'give', 'perfect', '5', 'have', 'say', 'liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'think', 'most', 'anyone', 'will', 'come', 'away', 'Bruce', 'smile', 'perhaps', 'even', 'little', 'enlightenment']",N/A

For those who are not fans of Jim, please understand what he does best is the delivery and timing of physical and quick witted jokes makes him an amazing physical comedian.Directed by Tom Shadyac (Patch Adams, Liar Liar, The Nutty Professor) It is the story of a regular guy who is down on his luck and always in the wrong place at the wrong time. He gets angry at God and speaks to him in a challenge.God - brilliantly played by played by Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Deep Impact, the Sum Of All Fears) is intrigued by his challenge and gives him all his powers for one week. God decides to take a vacation.Now give Jim Carey the power of God and look out! It's funny and provocative. Many lessons are learned and trials are given. Jennifer Anniston (Rock star, Picture Perfect, Friends) plays his wife and emotionally goes on a roller coaster with his antics and powers of God.Extremely funny and filled with special effects and sight gags that only Jim Carey could enhance.

763978,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B0000AKCKJ,"Maine Writer ""David""","[0, 0]","First the good news.  There are laugh out loud moments in this film.  But, those funny moments occur despite a rigid, rather lame script that has a number of opportunities to go off on creative tangents, but chooses, instead, to stick with cliches and a warm, fuzzy, and uninspired ending.This film is all about Jim Carrey, of course.  The rest of the cast is mere window dressing.  Jennifer Aniston is pleasant as a mild-mannered, and ultimately forgettable, love interest.  Morgan Freeman is a good choice to plan God, but he isn't given much to work with.  Most of the scenes are cliches after cliches.  Thankfully, Jim Carrey can make even a cliche work, and he does in a number of instances.  In the more dramatic moments, however, his performance grows thin, revealing the same insecurities and weaknesses that were evident in his earlier work, including The Mask (where he could not carry any of the dramatic interludes between the hilarious comedic pieces).  What happened to the Jim Carrey of The Truman Show?  Frankly, I suspect it's all about the director.  Tom Shadyac simply isn't a very good one.  This is, after all, the ""director"" who brought us drech like Patch Adams and Liar Liar.And it is worth noting the surplussage of cliche scenes--including a dinner scene where the woman thinks that her date will propose, but he has no such thing in mind; the encounter with a gang, and exacting of revenge; etc.  There's also plenty of low brow humor, which has come to be Shadyac trademark.  Without Carrey to pull it off, much of it would fall flat.So how does it all pan out?  For me, the laugh out loud scenes make it worth seeing.  It's been a while since Jim Carrey has let loose to get laughs, and, if you're a fan, that alone is worth it.",3,"Satisfying, yet unsatisfying.",1053734400,"05 24, 2003",2003,1757,"['First', 'good', 'news', 'are', 'loud', 'moments', 'film', 'funny', 'moments', 'occur', 'rigid', 'rather', 'lame', 'script', 'number', 'opportunities', 'go', 'off', 'creative', 'tangents', 'chooses', 'instead', 'stick', 'cliches', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'uninspired', 'ending.This', 'film', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'course', 'rest', 'cast', 'mere', 'window', 'dressing', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'pleasant', 'mild-mannered', 'ultimately', 'forgettable', 'love', 'interest', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'good', 'choice', 'plan', 'God', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'work', 'Most', 'scenes', 'are', 'cliches', 'cliches', 'Thankfully', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'can', 'make', 'even', 'cliche', 'work', 'number', 'instances', 'more', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'however', 'performance', 'grows', 'thin', 'revealing', 'same', 'insecurities', 'weaknesses', 'were', 'evident', 'earlier', 'work', 'including', 'Mask', 'where', 'could', 'not', 'carry', 'dramatic', 'interludes', 'hilarious', 'comedic', 'pieces', 'What', 'happened', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'Truman', 'Show', 'Frankly', 'suspect', 'director', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', 'simply', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'one', 'director', 'who', 'brought', 'drech', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'Liar', 'Liar.And', 'worth', 'noting', 'surplussage', 'cliche', 'scenes', 'including', 'dinner', 'scene', 'where', 'woman', 'date', 'will', 'propose', 'such', 'thing', 'mind', 'encounter', 'gang', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'etc', 'also', 'plenty', 'low', 'brow', 'humor', 'come', 'be', 'Shadyac', 'trademark', 'Carrey', 'pull', 'off', 'much', 'would', 'fall', 'flat.So', 'how', 'out', 'laugh', 'loud', 'scenes', 'make', 'worth', 'seeing', 'been', 'while', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'let', 'loose', 'get', 'laughs', ""'re"", 'fan', 'alone']",N/A

He brings a certain charm to Bruce that was missing from his previous roles.

I needn't have worried. The audience in the matinee screening I attended roared with laughter. Jim Carrey is back, funnier than ever.This fluffy comedy is sent in the environs of Buffalo, NY, where Jim Carrey's character Bruce toils as a newscaster for a local TV station, where he pines for the anchor desk, but due to his innate comedic talent is often sent to cover the sorts of ""human interest"" stories his colleagues wouldn't be caught dead doing. You know, the ones where he has to don a ridiculous costume and interview some clueless soul. In short, no matter how much he tries to get hard news assignments no one takes him seriously. (Like Carrey's movie career?)One day it seems Bruce's broadcasting dreams have come true. His boss sends him out on a much-coveted ""live feed"" -- only to discover on getting to the location that it involves putting on a silly hat to go out under Niagara Falls in a boat so he can get soaked to the skin while he tries to carry on a conversation with a dour centenarian. Just before the feed starts he learns on-air that he has been passed over for the coveted anchor position - and Bruce goes postal, as only Jim Carrey can. This naturally results in his losing his job, and things soon get worse, for in the same day he gets beaten (defending a homeless man), wrecks his car after asking God for a ""sign"" (ignoring the ones that pop out right before him), and nearly wrecks his relationship with his girlfriend Grace (played by Jennifer Aniston). Oh, and his dog still wants to pee on his favorite chair. The only bright spot in this Job-like catastrophe is that his pager still works, even after being run over by a car after he throws it out on the street. Intrigued, he picks it up. But on answering its summons to a dingy warehouse he meets a deity who doesn't lightning-and-thunder him into submission but rather offers him a job.Morgan Freemen portrays the Almighty, or rather, as I like to think of it, ""God Lite"": a fatherly figure who doesn't smite but patiently tries to get his creation's attention. The surprise is that Morgan plays God not only with his trademark gravitas but with a touch of humor. His droll wit plays well against Carrey's frantic capering. We first see Him as a janitor who sends Bruce to the man upstairs, then as the electrician on the top floor who reveals himself as the Man Upstairs. There are similar quasi-religious touches in the setting (Omni Presents), score and other details in the movie, never getting too preachy or sectarian.After a bit with a file drawer that may remind baby boomers of the ""bread"" gag from I LOVE LUCY, Bruce gets an offer he won't refuse. God gives him the use of his powers for a week- ""You think you can do it better, here's your chance."" At first Bruce, flummoxed, can hardly believe it - until he parts his soup like the Red Sea. (I kept waiting for Charlton Heston's voice to intone ""Behold, His mighty Hand"") Once he realizes ""he's got the power"" he goes a little crazy with it, using it to get back his career, his car, fixing things with his girlfriend and his dog. The results are hilarious. But no matter how powerful Bruce is, he can't do two things: make anyone love him or tell anyone about it. Once things are going good again it's his self-centeredness that lands him in the doghouse with Grace - and he finds he can't do a thing about it.Needless to say lessons are learned and repentance is achieved (even if it's not called that). Bruce, now appreciating what he has, gets back his life, and he finds that it IS a wonderful life (with more than one nod to that film), even if it's not the one he dreams of...",4,"Almighty, then!",1053907200,"05 26, 2003",2003,3895,"['Bruce', 'Almighty', '2003', 'Director', 'Tom', 'ShadyacRated', 'PG-13Jim', 'Carrey', 'Bruce', 'NolanJennifer', 'Aniston', 'GraceMorgan', 'Freeman', 'GodSteven', 'Carell', 'News', 'anchorCatherine', 'Bell', 'News', 'anchorBRUCE', 'ALMIGHTY', 'gotten', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'so', 'approached', 'cautiously', 'need', ""n't"", 'have', 'worried', 'audience', 'matinee', 'screening', 'attended', 'roared', 'laughter', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'back', 'funnier', 'ever.This', 'fluffy', 'comedy', 'sent', 'environs', 'Buffalo', 'NY', 'where', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'character', 'Bruce', 'newscaster', 'local', 'TV', 'station', 'where', 'anchor', 'desk', 'due', 'innate', 'comedic', 'talent', 'often', 'sent', 'cover', 'sorts', 'human', 'interest', 'stories', 'colleagues', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'caught', 'dead', 'doing', 'know', 'ones', 'where', 'don', 'ridiculous', 'costume', 'interview', 'clueless', 'soul', 'short', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'get', 'hard', 'news', 'one', 'seriously', 'Carrey', 'movie', 'career', 'One', 'day', 'Bruce', 'broadcasting', 'dreams', 'have', 'come', 'true', 'boss', 'out', 'much-coveted', 'live', 'feed', 'only', 'discover', 'getting', 'location', 'putting', 'silly', 'hat', 'go', 'out', 'Niagara', 'Falls', 'boat', 'can', 'get', 'soaked', 'skin', 'carry', 'conversation', 'dour', 'centenarian', 'Just', 'feed', 'on-air', 'been', 'passed', 'coveted', 'anchor', 'position', 'Bruce', 'postal', 'only', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'can', 'naturally', 'results', 'losing', 'job', 'things', 'soon', 'get', 'worse', 'same', 'day', 'beaten', 'defending', 'homeless', 'man', 'car', 'asking', 'God', 'sign', 'ignoring', 'ones', 'pop', 'out', 'right', 'nearly', 'wrecks', 'relationship', 'girlfriend', 'Grace', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Oh', 'dog', 'still', 'pee', 'favorite', 'chair', 'only', 'bright', 'spot', 'Job-like', 'catastrophe', 'pager', 'still', 'even', 'being', 'run', 'over', 'car', 'out', 'street', 'Intrigued', 'up', 'answering', 'summons', 'dingy', 'deity', 'who', ""n't"", 'lightning-and-thunder', 'submission', 'rather', 'job.Morgan', 'Freemen', 'Almighty', 'rather', 'like', 'think', 'God', 'Lite', 'fatherly', 'figure', 'who', ""n't"", 'smite', 'patiently', 'get', 'creation', 'attention', 'surprise', 'Morgan', 'God', 'not', 'only', 'trademark', 'gravitas', 'touch', 'humor', 'droll', 'wit', 'well', 'Carrey', 'frantic', 'capering', 'first', 'see', 'Him', 'janitor', 'who', 'Bruce', 'man', 'upstairs', 'then', 'electrician', 'top', 'floor', 'who', 'Man', 'Upstairs', 'are', 'similar', 'quasi-religious', 'touches', 'setting', 'Omni', 'Presents', 'score', 'other', 'details', 'movie', 'never', 'getting', 'too', 'preachy', 'sectarian.After', 'bit', 'file', 'drawer', 'may', 'remind', 'baby', 'boomers', 'bread', 'gag', 'LOVE', 'LUCY', 'Bruce', 'offer', 'wo', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'God', 'use', 'powers', 'week-', 'think', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'here', 'chance', 'first', 'Bruce', 'flummoxed', 'can', 'hardly', 'believe', 'parts', 'soup', 'Red', 'Sea', 'kept', 'waiting', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'voice', 'intone', 'Behold', 'mighty', 'Hand', 'got', 'power', 'little', 'crazy', 'using', 'get', 'back', 'career', 'car', 'fixing', 'things', 'girlfriend', 'dog', 'results', 'are', 'hilarious', 'matter', 'how', 'powerful', 'Bruce', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'two', 'things', 'make', 'anyone', 'love', 'tell', 'anyone', 'Once', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'good', 'again', 'self-centeredness', 'doghouse', 'Grace', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'thing', 'it.Needless', 'say', 'lessons', 'are', 'learned', 'repentance', 'achieved', 'even', 'not', 'called', 'Bruce', 'now', 'appreciating', 'what', 'back', 'life', 'wonderful', 'life', 'more', 'one', 'nod', 'film', 'even', 'not', 'one']",N/A

In those two films, Jim Carrey looked like he lost his comedic presence and tried so hard to be dramatic, but never would work. Now, he's come back in Bruce Almighty and has shown us that he still has to comedy in him. Although this movie was absolutely hilarious, I still feel that Liar,Liar is his best, but this ranks right up there in Carrey's best films.The movie is about a news reporter named Bruce Nolan, who's striving for the position of being anchorman on his news station. His career in being anchorman isn't looking like its about to happen, because one bad thing after another starts to happen to him, which he soon blames on God. After all these bad things happen to him, God finally gives him an answer and endows him with all of his powers. It's a hilarious movie from beginning to the end, showing us that Jim Carrey is back in his comedy role and that he can still do it. The acting was good and the jokes were not stale.

Jim Carrey has only really made one or two bad movies in his time but with classics such as 'ace ventura' and 'the truman show' under his belt i can see this becoming as high profile as those films as it is just as good and maybe even better in some ways. The film maintains the same ambient feeling throughout and there is no error with the acting or comedy, Jeniffer Aniston and Morgan Freeman deliver great performances throughout.To some it up as briefly as i can the film is about a guy who keeps getting lousy reports for the news channel that he works for and everything keeps going downhill in his life so he shouts and curses god for not helping him then he meets god after numerous pager messages, gets to have gods powers for a set amount of time while god goes on holiday then Jim Carrey reaks havoc for most of the film, trust me you have to see it really it's hard to go into detail about the comedy involved and there is plenty.One of the stand out parts in Bruce Almighty is when the news reporter speaks in a really high pitched strange way due to Bruce and his powers, so if you want to see the funniest comedy movie this year then this is bound to be up there with them.

What would you do if you could be God?Much of the enjoyment of ""Bruce Almighty"" comes out of watching Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) do just that, and we get to live vicariously through him. While that concept is enjoyable, the filmmakers failed to fully realize the possibilities. The film starts with a wonderful premise and ends up becoming a clich&eacute;d and predictable romantic-comedy/after-school-special-lesson movie.When Nolan's life begins to go down the tubes and blames God, he gets the chance of a lifetime. He's God while the real guy in white goes on vacation. So what does Nolan do with his newfound power? He does what anyone red-blooded human would do and abuses it. Sure it leads to some great scenes early on in the film - none of which I will spoil here ? but the film seems to gloss over so much of where it could have gone. What if he had goofed up and granted prayers that never should have been granted? What if that one prayer he answered caused cataclysmic events and he had to solve the situation. What about the moral dilemmas that could result from having ultimate power? These are all just some ideas I thought would have been great to explore in the film. Just think of all the great comical events that could have happened with them. But the filmmakers instead took the old and clich&eacute;d route of ""boy has girl, boy looses girl, boy tries to get girl back."" Now why would you resort to that tired route when you're in the middle of a greater story about becoming God?Perhaps I'm being too hard on ""Bruce Almighty.""

Even the stuff in the previews is still funny in the context of the movie.  I don't think I need to rehash the plot.  It's very straightforward, and a great vehicle for Jim Carrey.  And he doesn't disappoint.  He's in fine form, combining his character from LIAR, LIAR with a smidgen of Ace Ventura and Cable Guy to give him an edge.Carrey, according to stories written about this movie, is an extreme perfectionist, often driving co-star Jennifer Aniston crazy with his demands for more and more takes.  Thank goodness he's demanding.  Sure, maybe in ""real life"" he's a jerk, but at least he still knows what's funny!!!  There were three or four times where I was laughing SO HARD that tears were forming.  No exagerration.  My wife had to wipe her eyes numerous times.  There's low humor: a street-hardened thug tells Bruce, whom he offended earlier in the movie, ""I'll apologize when monkeys come out of my butt.""  Well, as he soon discovers, this is not a statement you want to make to a guy with God's powers!  Is the idea gross?  You bet.  Is it funny?  My God, it's even funnier than one would think possible.  Yet, there are also plenty of sly jokes, clever site gags (much fun is had with post-it notes) and social/political commentary.Carrey is funny.  That's good enough reason to see the movie.  But fortunately, Jennifer Aniston provides very game support as his long-term girlfriend (she isn't really given funny stuff to do, but she's a perfect foil for him) and Morgan Freeman is better than he's been in awhile playing God...his God has a twinkly sense of humor, but just a tiny hint behind the easy going demeanor that you really don't want to mess with the Lord Almighty!Sure, the ending of the movie gets a bit mushy and ""Hollywood,"" but quite frankly, the movie has worked harder than most to earn those ""tear-jerking"" moments, and they are quite endurable.  Also, don't leave right away, there are some amusing outtakes during the closing credits.Finally, the PG-13 rating.  There are some mild sexual situations, and the whole ""monkey sequence"" but I had my 10 year old with me and didn't feel uncomfortable...and I'm usually a prude when it comes to those things.

763996,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,B0000AKCKJ,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[0, 0]","I must confess that i have been reluctant to go see the movie because it looked like a caricature of Christianity from the reviews and water cooler talk.The humor comes primarily from Jim Carrey's extraordinary physical humor, very little from any sophisticated wit. The movie started out pretty good, looked like an analysis of theodicy, that is simply ""why good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people"" if a good, powerful, just God is in control of the universe. theodicy is a big, hard problem and i'd welcome humor to help understand even one of the issues involved. But that was not to be in this movie, it lost the intellectual appeal to me with the childish antics that Carrey's character immediately fell into doing when he had God's power. Sure the scenes are cute but the humor doesn't rise above the level of freshman animal house, although the writers sincerely try to be more with the accent on the issue of love between Carrey and Jennifer Aniston's character. but the effort falls flat.There are big issues involved: purpose of living, relationships, theodicy. But these are lost in the anthropomorphic God, not in His portrayal by Morgan Freeman which is excellent, but in the anthropomorphic things he does and that Carrey does while he is playing God. There are the usual ridicule of religious belief: the golden calf on a table at a party, parting of the red tomato soup, water into wine, of course the obligatory walking-on-water. Again they're cute but nothing more, no real significance other than Morgan Freeman pointing out that the soup trick was a magic trick not a real miracle. The anthropomorphic God has to do with answering prayers for things, although the scene with Carrey on the roof outside of Aniston's room praying in more than a simple request for lottery tickets, a testimony to the writers desire to be something more than physical humor. Plus this god changes his own lightbulbs, and most importantly mops his own floors, along with a short speech by Freeman about the dignity of physical labor.But what the movie is more about on the philosophic level is given in the two rules God imposes on Carrey: don't tell anyone you are god, and you can't do anything to control human freewill. There is a scene where Carrey tries to use god's power to make Aniston love him, but of course the power doesn't work under these conditions. The second hint is Freeman's last little speech to Carrey near the end about the need to exercise his own human power to get what he wants. This is the theme, God is a deus ex machina, a god-from-the-machine, nothing more than a cheap theatrical trick to pop up an anthropomorphic god who will bail human kind, or at least the hero who has gotten himself into trouble, out of their/his/our current mess. The human centered message is that life is important, the things you want are important since they are significant to you, whether love or a hot car or revenge on the block bullies or your competition at work. If you want them all you need to do if go after them, don't wait for some god-in-a-box, do it yourself. You've got the power.

763998,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0000AKCKJ,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","**1/2""Bruce Almighty"" is yet another ""high concept"" comedy starring Jim Carrey, this time as a self-pitying, put-upon TV news reporter in Buffalo who finds himself endowed with all God's powers when the Almighty Himself decides to take a little vacation.This material may seem tailor-made for Mr. Carrey's manic talents, but the makers of the film - screenwriters Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe and Steve Oedekerk, and director Tom Shadyac - have failed to discover any really innovative ways of approaching it.  When Bruce learns that he has the power to alter the world's reality at will, he spends most of his time playing foolish little parlor tricks on people who irritate him.  Carrey can still be wildly funny when the script calls for him to do that rubber-faced-and-bodied slapstick routine for which he is justly famous, but ""Bruce Almighty"" is not content to be a cynical, outrageous farce.  It also wants to be a ""meaningful"" love-thy-neighbor comedy, and falls down miserably in the process.  Morgan Freeman as God gets to do little but deliver high-toned, sappy homilies designed to make Bruce see the importance of the power that's been entrusted to him.  True to the formula - one that goes at least as far back as Frank Capra films in the 1930's - the film turns hopelessly mawkish and sentimental in its final third.  That would be forgivable had ""Bruce Almighty"" at least given us some cutting-edge outrageousness in its early stretches.Jennifer Aniston exudes the requisite amount of charm as Bruce's devoted girlfriend, but the role is hardly one to challenge this obviously gifted young actress (see last year's ""The Good Girl"").  And there are a few moments when the filmmakers seem to have latched onto a clever or creative concept.  But those moments are quick to pass and, before we know it, we are once again mired in the predictability of yet another manufactured, by-the-numbers Hollywood product.  An additional problem with the movie is that it often defies the essential credibility that even an absurdist scenario such as this one demands.  At least twice in the film, for instance, a flipped out, ranting reporter is allowed to stay on the air long after any halfway competent news show producer would have pulled the proverbial plug on him.If it weren't for the presence of the gifted Carrey, ""Bruce Almighty"" would seem like just another ""Bewitched"" episode expanded out to feature length.

764000,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0000AKCKJ,Samuel McKewon,"[0, 2]","""Bruce Almighty"" suffers from a surprising lack of ambition and creativity -- it's rare that a comedy about a man bestowed with God-like powers would stoop to segments as dumb as teaching one's dog to pee into a toilet, but there you have it. The opposite of outrageous, the movie actually strives to be humble: Were a human allowed to be God, they'd fix their own lives first, the world later, and, in the end, just plain stink at the job and admit defeat. It's a sweet sentiment, but not the kind of thing you'd figure to see in a Jim Carrey extravaganza.Carrey is pretty bizarre as Buffalo TV reporter Bruce Nolan -- the performance is so self-aware and mugging you get the sense that Carrey's madness over being consigned again to cheap comedy after the weighty, overrated fare of ""Man On the Moon"" and ""The Majestic"" is just barely concealed under the surface. Nolan has a cool girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston, content to stand aside and say ""Ole!"") and a reasonable features reporter job at a good station, but he wants more: The anchor slot, and, in the subtext, the female anchor herself (Catherine Bell in bigtime, hotcha vamp).Nolan loses the job to a creep (Steven Carell), learns about it just as he's about to go on the air and melts down in front of Buffalo. Carrey, as in the other ""rage"" scenes, is so convincing you wonder what this tortured man's nights must be like. Predictable chaos ensues after the meltdown, Nolan decides, pretty much out of the blue, to curse God for his ugly fate, upon which God, played by Morgan Freeman in a white suit, reveals himself, and charges Bruce with the almightyness of one Buffalo neighborhood. Bruce, shall we say, prefers party tricks and selfish perks to the more spiritual aspects of the vocation. Eventually, of course, he sees the light, accepts his limitations in life, and does President George W. Bush proud: He decides to settle for his small life, doing good, small deeds, leaving Important Things to Important People. ""Bruce Almighty"" is nearly a parable arguing classism.Some of Bruce's vengeance pays off with laughs, the best being an eye-watering bit where he ruins the new creepy anchor career with gibberish and phony tele-prompter cues. But most of it is obvious and lame, and Carrey's longtime directorial collaborator Tom Shadyac (thrilled, I'm sure, to be back with Carrey after bombs with Robin Williams and Kevin Costner respectively) certainly brings no original flair to the table. Carrey dreamt up a few verbal riffs for the film and neither  ""it's good, it's good, it's good"" nor ""B-E-A-Utiful"" stand to make the bible of pop culture mimicry. Aniston is wasted in the teary-eyed, poor suffering saint role, while Philip Baker Hall must have needed some fast cash to park his grizzled mug in a movie like this.Freeman is...nice; he actually gets Carrey to pay attention during their scenes together. Otherwise, Carrey is unleashed with all the fury that he bottled in during his recent drama stints. Problem is, the screenplays leaves him nowhere to go. It's entirely ordinary, even moralistic. If Jim Carrey's going to be God -- and you only get to be God once, pretty much -- might as well put some bang into it.",2,"Sets its sights pretty low, but it does hit its mark.",1057017600,"07 1, 2003",2003,3194,"['Bruce', 'Almighty', 'suffers', 'surprising', 'lack', 'ambition', 'creativity', 'rare', 'comedy', 'man', 'bestowed', 'God-like', 'powers', 'would', 'stoop', 'segments', 'as', 'dumb', 'teaching', 'one', 'dog', 'pee', 'toilet', 'there', 'have', 'opposite', 'outrageous', 'movie', 'actually', 'be', 'humble', 'Were', 'human', 'allowed', 'be', 'God', ""'d"", 'fix', 'own', 'lives', 'first', 'world', 'later', 'end', 'just', 'plain', 'stink', 'job', 'admit', 'defeat', 'sweet', 'sentiment', 'not', 'kind', 'thing', ""'d"", 'figure', 'see', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'extravaganza.Carrey', 'pretty', 'bizarre', 'Buffalo', 'TV', 'reporter', 'Bruce', 'Nolan', 'performance', 'so', 'self-aware', 'mugging', 'get', 'sense', 'Carrey', 'madness', 'being', 'consigned', 'again', 'cheap', 'comedy', 'weighty', 'overrated', 'fare', 'Man', 'Moon', 'Majestic', 'just', 'barely', 'concealed', 'surface', 'Nolan', 'cool', 'girlfriend', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'content', 'stand', 'aside', 'say', 'Ole', 'reasonable', 'features', 'reporter', 'job', 'good', 'station', 'more', 'anchor', 'slot', 'subtext', 'female', 'anchor', 'Catherine', 'Bell', 'bigtime', 'hotcha', 'vamp', '.Nolan', 'job', 'creep', 'Steven', 'Carell', 'just', 'go', 'air', 'melts', 'down', 'front', 'Buffalo', 'Carrey', 'other', 'rage', 'scenes', 'so', 'convincing', 'wonder', 'what', 'tortured', 'man', 'nights', 'must', 'be', 'Predictable', 'chaos', 'ensues', 'meltdown', 'Nolan', 'pretty', 'much', 'blue', 'curse', 'God', 'ugly', 'fate', 'God', 'played', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'white', 'suit', 'charges', 'Bruce', 'almightyness', 'one', 'Buffalo', 'neighborhood', 'Bruce', 'shall', 'say', 'prefers', 'party', 'tricks', 'selfish', 'perks', 'more', 'spiritual', 'aspects', 'vocation', 'Eventually', 'course', 'light', 'limitations', 'life', 'President', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'proud', 'settle', 'small', 'life', 'doing', 'good', 'small', 'deeds', 'leaving', 'Important', 'Things', 'Important', 'People', 'Bruce', 'Almighty', 'nearly', 'parable', 'arguing', 'classism.Some', 'Bruce', 'vengeance', 'laughs', 'best', 'being', 'eye-watering', 'bit', 'where', 'new', 'creepy', 'anchor', 'career', 'gibberish', 'phony', 'tele-prompter', 'cues', 'most', 'obvious', 'lame', 'Carrey', 'longtime', 'directorial', 'collaborator', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', 'thrilled', ""'m"", 'sure', 'be', 'back', 'Carrey', 'bombs', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'respectively', 'certainly', 'original', 'flair', 'table', 'Carrey', 'up', 'few', 'verbal', 'riffs', 'film', 'good', 'good', 'good', 'B-E-A-Utiful', 'stand', 'make', 'bible', 'pop', 'culture', 'mimicry', 'Aniston', 'wasted', 'teary-eyed', 'poor', 'suffering', 'saint', 'role', 'Philip', 'Baker', 'Hall', 'must', 'have', 'needed', 'fast', 'cash', 'park', 'grizzled', 'mug', 'movie', 'this.Freeman', 'nice', 'actually', 'Carrey', 'pay', 'attention', 'scenes', 'together', 'Otherwise', 'Carrey', 'unleashed', 'fury', 'bottled', 'recent', 'drama', 'stints', 'Problem', 'screenplays', 'nowhere', 'go', 'entirely', 'ordinary', 'even', 'moralistic', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'going', 'be', 'God', 'only', 'get', 'be', 'God', 'once', 'pretty', 'much', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'put', 'bang']",N/A

In fact it seems to be an attempt to repackage that Carrey monomaniacal magic, but it mostly fails. Instead of the unlimited power of a mask, Carrey is given the power of God. I don't know if it was intended, but at times the story and the humor get bogged down by religious faith elements.Carrey is funny, as usual, but the movie resorts to lowbrow humor, like when a monkey comes out of a man's butt. The closest they came to that in The Mask was when the dog urinated on a bad guy. It's unbelievable, but Carrey does nothing interesting or particularly funny with the power of God. He thinks only of petty revenge and being a news anchor for a TV station in Buffalo, New York. What? And the scenes with Jennifer Aniston praying for Carrey's ""happiness"" while she cried and wondered if she wanted to live anymore were NOT funny.

The scene where Jim's charachter uses his power to make the news anchor babble incoherently made me laugh harder than I have laughed in a long time. Steve Carrel does wonderfully in this scene and really makes it work. Jennifer Anniston play's Carrey's love interest and Bruce uses his powers to do what any normal red blooded male would do with God-like powers: Cause his woman to climax from an entirely different room. While the scene was meant to be funny, every guy who watches this is going to be thinking &quot;I wonder if you can really do that...&quot; Every girl will probably be thinking the same thing.The suprising thing about the movie is that the basic story is one of a very serious and religious nature. The comedy is just the wrapping paper that conceals a concept of deep philosophical and religious consequence: God's wisdom and will versus the will and wisdom of man. My pastor has even toyed with the idea of showing this film to the congregation (slightly edited, of course) as a lesson about how we should view God.It is a very good film with some great comedy thrown in.

I am surely not alone.  Carrey has a distinct connection with &#65533;Marmite&#65533;, a product generating a split in society through a Love Vs Hate barrier.  Ace Ventura; Mask; Cable Guy; Dumb and Dumber; Liar Liar; all left a lot to be desired in my opinion and yet I find myself encountered in debate with friends who obviously dislike Marmite (I personally love it!).  Through the despite lack of enthusiasm I hold for Mr Carrey, I have noticed his style harvesting and maturing into something fascinating.  We now see him taking on scripts, which I can&#65533;t help think is something he truly feels connected with when the cameras are halted.  Carrey wants to be internally taken seriously, but is often pushed aside because of his blinding appearance which perceivers view as a juvenile type character with ephemeral antics that are almost out of steam.  &#65533;Truman Show&#65533; relates to my theory; Carrey taking on the more serious role and I agree, very good film plot, but Carrey was missing something and I can&#65533;t put my finger on it, but he was far from spectacular. Until now of course&#65533;Jim Carrey was born to play the character of &#65533;Brue Almighty&#65533;, how often can you say that about an actor?  Frustrated with what life brings him, a job, which could open the door to the pinnacle of success, but yet Bruce feels trapped.  Feeling the unluckiest man alive, it is not surprising that Bruce finds comprehension a little hard to comprehend when confronted with God (Morgan Freeman). Luckily God has a sense of humour and will cast aside the many blasphemous comments Bruce has made to offer him a chance to play God.  With every opportunity of changing all his bad luck to good, Bruce faces the undeniable truth that he is his own worst enemy and that is the very reason he has had bad luck for so long.The elements that will surely make this film a success will not solely depend on Mr Carrey either. Tom Shadyac (director) will now certainly be taking seriously in the film industry after pulling off some cleverly placed camera shots.  Another surprising performance was from Jennifer Aniston, clearly stamping down her mark on the film industry and has in my opinion been the most impressive out of the &#65533;Friends&#65533; cast.  Aniston has the calibre to play someone other than the character &#65533;Rachel&#65533;, unlike Matt Le Blanc and Lisa Kudrow respectively.  Morgan Freeman is as outstanding as ever, applying his usual captivation of on-screen appearance and utterly distinguishing voice.Bruce Almighty will undoubtedly cause a storm.You&#65533;ll Laugh.

764015,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B0000AKCKJ,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","I was somewhat leery about watching BRUCE ALMIGHTY because of all the various reviews I had read and some of the things I had heard. After seeing the film, I found it to be a decent movie that had a great deal to say about the importance of prayer. Jennifer Aniston was perfect as Grace and she outshined Carrey in every scene they shared. Morgan Freeman was a nice touch, because he's such a talented actor that he brings a touch of class to any project, no matter how bad it is. Those are the positives.Now, for the negatives. To begin with, this is not one of Jim Carrey's better movies. The film is supposed to be a comedy, but it also portrays itself as a film with a very serious message. Therefore, Carrey's antics, as humorous as they are, really don't fit in with the reality of the movie.Which brings us the main thing wrong about the film: the central message of the film is about the importance of prayer and how powerful prayer can be. God does listen to our prayers. In this materialistic, post-modernistic, unmoral world we are living in, it's good for people to be reminded of the power and importance of prayer. God does hear our prayers and we have to trust Him that what happens in our lives will eventually turn out for the best (if not in this world, in the world to come). That's a great message. However, it's only half the story. God is love, but God is also Truth.God is holy and cannot exist with sin. Sin is a word people don't like to talk about, but just because many ignore it doesn't mean it stops to exist. BRUCE ALMIGHTY has a lot to say about prayer, but it doesn't say anything about sin. Bruce was mad at God because his life was falling apart around him and he didn't understand why. Now, I'm not going to say God wouldn't answer him, but Bruce never once consider that maybe God was trying to answer him, but couldn't because of the sin in Bruce's life. Bruce and Grace were living in sin, pure and simple. Their fornication and immorality shouldn't be taken lightly. But, in the movie it is. In fact, it's paraded, made to seem perfectly legitimate, perfectly okay with God. Fact is, God hates fornication. He detests it. Sin is sin and though we can be forgiven of our sins, if we blatantly continue to live in sin without any repentance, it is seriously going to hinder our relationship with God. So, that's that.As a movie, BRUCE ALMIGHTY isn't too bad. It's fairly entertaining and it is nice to see Jim Carrey coming back to his comic roots. The movie also has a lot to say about the power of prayer. Nevertheless, the film does have some serious flaws, mainly how it totally ignores the issue of sin.

After blowing his lid, Carrey loses his job.  In despair, he does what mankind has been doing for centuries--blames God.After a day of moping, God (played quite convincingly by Morgan Freeman) grants Carrey His powers.  Of course, ""Bruce Almighty"" wreaks havoc on his professional rival and scoops the big stories by ""creating"" disasters as he pleases.The role of God begins to overwhelm him when he answers ""yes"" to too many prayer requests and his girlfriend (the incredible Jennifer Anniston) begins to turn her back on him.In the end, Carrey learns the power of the free will of mankind and learns the beauty of surrender to the will of God.A great movie.

764017,A7QYHLIRZLMLQ,B0000AKCKJ,"viagrafalls ""Peter Schmitz""","[0, 0]","After hearing next to nothing from Carrey for a while, he's back in Bruce Almighty.Bruce Nolan (Carrey) is a reporter, working for a small-time news channel. He's sent out to events other reporters surely would frown upon, and turns the events into humorous. When we meet him, he's doing a piece on a gigantic cookie.From then on, his life starts going downhill. He gets passed on a promotion to be Anchor Man for the network, he wrecks his car, his dog wets the chair again, he loses his job, gets beaten up, etc.Bruce blames God for all the tragedy in his life, which inspires God (Morgan Freeman) to contact Bruce, and have Bruce fall in for him for a week. In other words, Bruce is left with all the powers God possesses, and God leaves for a well-deserved vacation. There are just two rules to follow when it comes to 'playing' God:Bruce can't tell anyone he has Godly powers, and he's not allowed to go against the Free Will of the people.Bruce immediately starts (ab)using the Powers to make his life a little better. He gets back on everything and everyone doing him wrong. He uses them to improve his love life and to make his girlfriend's (Jennifer Aniston) breasts slightly larger.But playing God is not all about fun. There are prayers to be answered, and good to be done. Slowly but gradually, Bruce starts getting aware of this, as well as that you can't simply answer 'yes' to everyone's wishes.When he loses his girlfriend over a fight, he's desperate to try and win her back, but the 'Free will' rule prevents him from using his powers to do so. It is then that Bruce starts realising what a tough job being God really is.Freeman is extraordinary in his role of God, Carrey shines as Bruce, Steven Carell was simply amazing, the jokes are good, and the plot is (although predictable) a nice combination of humour, romance, and perhaps even a tiny part of making you see that no matter how bad things are going for you, there's always someoneoff even worse.Be sure to stay seated when the credits start rolling.

Bruce Almighty is a very funny movie in no small part due to the supreme acting of Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman. Freeman plays God not as a stern taskmaster but someone who matter-of-factly passes on his wisdom and lessons. Freeman plays the Lord with a self effacing sense of humor and, not surprisngly, it works very well.Carrey plays a television reporter (the Bruce of the title)who's career has stalled; he's stuck doing the warm, fuzzy, funny segments on things like the biggest chocolate cookie ever baked. No one takes his aspirations seriously. All of this stands in the way of Bruce's biggest goal; to become the evening anchor person for his television station. His rival, played marvelously by the very funny Steven Carrell, has him beat at every turn. He even steals one of Bruce's sign off lines as he acknowledges acceptance on the air of the anchorman position.Director Tom Shadyac (Ace Ventura)brings out the best in Carrey. The comedy is a bit predictable and the script packed with cliches but that doesn't prevent Shadyac, Carrey, Jennifer Aniston (who has a thankless task as the love interest. All she is given to do is to &quot;react&quot;. Some of her doubletakes do inspire a few chuckles but it's clear that Carrey is the center of attention here), Morgan Freeman and the rest of the cast from presenting some truly inspired scenes and acting. Comdies, like action movies, are now build around a number of set pieces, i.e., sequences that continuously rope you into the movie. Most films that rely on these set pieces don't have a very solid script. The script is a bit inconsistent although there are a number of sequences that stand out more than others.The DVD looks solid although there's quite a bit of digital artifacts in the way of compression issues during some the night sequences. If you purchased this DVD you'll also note a flaw and I'm pretty sure it was deliberate; everytime you start the movie up you're forced (like some of the Disney DVDs) to watch the coming attractions trailers. This trend was started by Disney and Universal takes it to absurd new heights; you can't bypass it unless you press the fast forward button on your DVD remote. The disc prevents you from accessing the main menu directly. It's annoying, poorly thought out and designed. It's also an example of the shoddy products that Universal has put out of late (including the incorrectly framed Back To The Future trilogy and the interlacing problems with Monty Python and The Meaning of Life which caused the image to blur anytime someone moves). Universal has had a large amount of problems with recalled DVDs of late. If this problem is an accident, I'm hoping Universal fixes the problem soon as this could be really annoying on lots of DVDs. If it was on purpose, they owe it to consumers to discontinue this practice and to correct the problem with the DVDs. Universal's email address is universal@dreamworks@leemarketing.com. If you're unhappy, let them know!Bruce Almighty is entertaining and, despite a couple of minor swear words, a fun movie.
