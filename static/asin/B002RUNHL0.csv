1285868,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B002RUNHL0,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[10, 11]","Mayson (Dan Selon) is a twenty-something gay man who is waiting for his first kiss (Yes, really!)  His BFF, Robyn (Kendra Thomas) is pushing Mayson to be more aggressive about meeting other guys, and be open to whatever might happen, such as speaking to the cute guy they saw at the library and again at a coffee shop.  At a party thrown by a mutual friend, Mayson encounters Reilly (his crush) again, and learns he had recently broken up with a girlfriend (Uh, oh).  Of course, since this takes place in the Los Angeles area, where all cute guys are gay, Mayson and Reilly find a common interest in each other, and it goes from there.The story is told in flashbacks with quick cuts to scenes with different characters, making it a bit confusing.  While the concept is sweet and charming, and the attractive, inexperienced cast does the best with what they were given, the story (such as it is) suffers from rather cartoonish situations and some of the most inane dialogue I have ever heard in a film.  There are also problems with the sound, and I had to constantly lower and raise the volume to hear one bit of dialogue, only to be blasted out of my seat at the next scene.  Not rated, but would be a PG-13 at worst. DVD has no extras besides trailers and chapter stops. Best I can do on this one is give it three stars out of five.",3,"Sweet enough to make your teeth hurt, but not much substance.",1262131200,"12 30, 2009",2009,1334,"['Mayson', 'Dan', 'Selon', 'twenty-something', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'waiting', 'first', 'kiss', 'Yes', 'really', 'BFF', 'Robyn', 'Kendra', 'Thomas', 'pushing', 'Mayson', 'be', 'more', 'aggressive', 'meeting', 'other', 'guys', 'be', 'open', 'might', 'happen', 'such', 'speaking', 'cute', 'guy', 'saw', 'library', 'again', 'coffee', 'shop', 'party', 'thrown', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Mayson', 'Reilly', 'crush', 'again', 'had', 'recently', 'broken', 'up', 'girlfriend', 'Uh', 'oh', 'course', 'place', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'area', 'where', 'cute', 'guys', 'are', 'gay', 'Mayson', 'Reilly', 'find', 'common', 'interest', 'other', 'there.The', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'quick', 'cuts', 'scenes', 'different', 'characters', 'making', 'bit', 'confusing', 'concept', 'sweet', 'charming', 'attractive', 'inexperienced', 'cast', 'best', 'what', 'were', 'given', 'story', 'such', 'suffers', 'rather', 'cartoonish', 'situations', 'most', 'inane', 'dialogue', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'film', 'are', 'also', 'problems', 'sound', 'had', 'constantly', 'lower', 'raise', 'volume', 'hear', 'one', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'only', 'be', 'blasted', 'seat', 'next', 'scene', 'Not', 'rated', 'would', 'be', 'PG-13', 'worst', 'DVD', 'extras', 'trailers', 'chapter', 'stops', 'Best', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'give', 'three', 'five']",Be Mine

And truth be told, it was difficult to link the main characters with college students, they seemed a bit too old for the role.

Two friends meet up after a wedding and they start remembering the past year that leads to the wedding.  At first, this movie looks and feels like a Indie movie.  Its feels more like a biography than a movie.1 year prior.... Very simple plot... Two men, one who never had a first kiss; and the second, ending a straight type  more-or-less relationship meet by accident.  At a library, at a coffee place; then finally at a best friends party.  They eventually get to know one another over drinking way too much.  But whats typical is these men seem to have an attraction that is not really known to themselves in the beginning.  After a night of drinking and one of them takes care of the other, they meet up the next day for a &#34;thanks for helping me out&#34; dinner night.  They in turn happen to fall on valentines night (or it is indicated) and have a love connection.
