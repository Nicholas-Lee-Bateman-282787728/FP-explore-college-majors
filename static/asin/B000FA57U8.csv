Jack finally gets his own bistro restaurant and of course antics ensue along the way. Priscilla Barnes who plays nurse Terri was a great addition to Three's Company, even better than Suzanne Somers. I love this show to pieces and season seven is definitely my favorite season.

986707,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000FA57U8,andy8047,"[15, 25]","Are you ready for more adventures of apartment 201 and its occupants Jack Tripper,Janet Wood and Terri Alden? Cindy Snow is now history(Jenilee Harrison who joined the Three's Company cast in late 1980 was written out after 1981-82). Here's what happens this season. Jack(the late great John Ritter) joins Janet(Joyce DeWitt) and a male business associate in a dinner date. Jack was ""under the weather"" at the time and winds up so drunk that after he and Janet return home,he juggles and shatters Janet's heirloom vase that was given to her by her grandmother. Jack takes his toothache to Terri's(Priscilla Barnes) boyfriend dentist Dr. Phil Greene(Jeffrey Tambor,star of Fox's Arresting Development and late of the TC spinoff The Ropers and HBO's The Larry Sanders Show). Phil,whose clientele are grade school children,gives Terri an engagement ring one night after dinner but they wind up breaking up. Phil even accused Terri of having an affair with Jack. Jack thinks the blind date his upstairs neighbor and buddy Larry Dallas(Richard Kline) set Jack up with got Jack in trouble(this girl accidentally reached the trio's newly purchased answering machine,also she and a male friend are diamond thieves. She planted the diamonds inside Jack's jacket pocket while she kissed him). Larry met this girl and admitted that he fixed Jack up with somebody else. Larry also said he'd never dump a beautiful girl like the diamond thief whose name is Rita. A columnist named Hank Thompson who has a date with Janet,interviews the trio and writes a column that turned many people off,including a girlfriend of Jack's(she broke their date to attend a carnival). The trio's landlord Ralph Furley(the late great Don Knotts and late of The Andy Griffith Show) talked Hank into printing a retraction(Ralph told Hank that Jack was a homosexual). Then there's the birth of Jack's Bistro,Jack's longtime dream that finally came true. Jack,still employed as a chef at (Frank)Angelino's,is given the opportunity of a lifetime by Frank(Jordan Charney,recurringly). Jack's Bistro is housed in another piece of Frank's property. Jack withdraws most of his money from the bank to open the French cuisine eatery. But it almost didn't happen when he failed to pay Frank first month's rent of $800. But the generous Ralph took care of that. Ralph was initially shocked but,hey,no sacrifice was too great for friends like Jack,right? Ralph even came up the name for the restaurant(""How hard can it be to come up with a name for Jack's bistro?"". Janet,Terri and Larry came up with various names that Jack took into consideration. While the trio,Larry and Ralph were preparing for the grand opening,one problem arose:Larry,a used car salesman and also an expert in advertising,handed out hundreds of flyers advertising the bistro's opening with the wrong date! I think he did that intentionally for the sake of his visiting Greek family who were the bistro's first patrons. All that food Jack bought almost went to waste,but Larry's family ate it all! After dinner,there was Greek music and dancing. But,the dinner plates were shattered(the Greek show their appreciation by doing something like that). Maria,the engaged cousin of Jack's friend and former co-worker Felipe Gomez,stays with the trio for a few days. Maria's engagement to Manuel was broken and renewed. In one episode,Felipe helped out in the Jack's Bistro kitchen(the restaurant was formerly Charlie's Spot). Larry even briefly worked as a lounge singer,receiving applause from girls he dated,co-workers and softball teammates. In that episode,Ralph worked in the kitchen. Jack goes on a date with Larry's teenage sister Diane. Terri is on a dinner date at home with a paroled murderer. Terri almost married a soap opera actor named Brett Wade(Dennis Cole,ex-husband of Jaclyn Smith). Brett entered Terri's hospital Wilshire Memorial one day with a few broken ribs and she fell in love with him immediately. But,he only wanted to marry her for a contract renewal. Terri,while watching Brett's daytime serial(the fictitous) County Hospital(like the real ABC serial General Hospital),sees Brett shot to death by a jealous girlfriend. A married couple named Bob and Carol who live in the Santa Monica,CA complex also,have broken up because of a rumor about something that happened on their last vacation. There was no two-timing afterall and the couple made up. At the local pub,the Regal Beagle,Ralph sitting at the bar alongside a musclebound boxer named Biff Bower accidentally spills Biff's beer. Raplh offered to buy Biff another beer,but Jack,also sitting next to Ralph,""got a little hot"" with Biff,and Biff challenged Jack to a fight in the ring at Rocco's Gym where Biff works out. Jack thought that Janet was on a date with Ralph's visiting teenage nephew Marc. Jack saw them together while dining alone in a restaurant(not his,of course). While sporting a fake moustache,Jack suddenly won romantic affections from Terri! Jack got the idea from Larry who showed up at the Beagle with one. Jack also saves Arnie's Leather Shop from closing down(he bought a leather coat with $500 prize money). Angry Janet and Terri thought he bought the jacket with his restaurant rent money. On February 24,2006,81-year-old Don Knotts died of lung cancer. I dedicate this item to his memory and also of Ritter who died at age 54 of a heart ailment on September 11,2003. We'll be waiting for the eighth and final season now.",5,"Seven down,one to go",1145404800,"04 19, 2006",2006,5450,"['Are', 'ready', 'more', 'adventures', 'apartment', '201', 'occupants', 'Jack',

986712,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,B000FA57U8,Green Manalishi,"[0, 0]","THUS BEGINS THE FIRST GREAT SEASON OF 'THE TERRI YEARS'.  I should say first of all that I was almost ready to give up on this show after drudging through Season 5 (Cindy) AND through Season 6, Terri's debut season.  I gave Season 6 two stars, so the four that I give this season represent a MARKED improvement in EVERYTHING.  It's the first ""Terri season"" in which the cast really begins to get their groove on.  The introduction of Jack's restaurant is a GREAT new scenario that provided a much-needed direction for the show, and with very pleasing results as Season 7 will attest to.While the first two discs spend time establishing Jack getting set up in his new restaurant (with varied results), the last two discs in this season are where the bulk of the truly funny episodes lie - two favorites would be disc 3's ""Starstruck"" where a famous soap star wants to marry Terri - the girls are just on fire as Terri explains exactly how the star asked her to marry him.  Janet is enrapt and the chemistry is marvoulous!  I really felt that the cast had become one at this point.  As if the ghost of Chrissy was no longer dogging Terri's heels (Chrissy is still my all-time favorite on the blond side).In ""Jack's Double Date"", Jack makes a bet with the girls that he won't date any women for a week, but is somehow talked into taking a depressed Furley down to the Beagle for singles night.  What distinguishes the bulk of Season 7 from the previous two seasons is that the writing has again become clever and the scenarios, while ever beset with the Three's Company 'misunderstanding', has a lot of other forces working for it as well.  Angelino plays the villainous boss part well.  Furley is really better than ever, and has a lot of on-screen time with a fair few stories wrapped around him mostly to hilarious effect, especially in the second half of the season where the writing is best.  In the beginning episodes for example, I wasn't overly impressed with his stint at the restaurant as Jack's kitchen help or as he tried to put up wallpaper that kept coming down - this is just slapstick.  And I can take slapstick so long as there are other elements around it (situation or clever dialogue), but slapstick alone ain't enough! As the previous two seasons will attest to.I'm glad I purchased this season of Three's Company at the same time I bought Season 6 as I was about ready to give up on this show after Season 6.  I'd begun to suspect the show had died, and that my fond memories of the Terri years were an error of childhood imagination.  So it was to great surprise that I found Season 7 getting back on it's feet and making me laugh!  This is a GREAT season in the Three's Company saga and I recommend it to any who may be having doubts due to the weakness of the previous two seasons.  The second half of the season is the best (5 stars) while the first half is varied though leaning towards better rather than worse (4 stars).  I will be picking up Season 8 after all.",4,Three's Company on its feet again...,1286668800,"10 10, 2010",2010,2988,"['THUS', 'BEGINS', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'GREAT', 'SEASON', 'OF', 'TERRI', 'YEARS', 'should', 'say', 'first', 'was', 'almost', 'ready', 'give', 'up', 'show', 'drudging', 'Season', '5', 'Cindy', 'Season', '6', 'Terri', 'debut', 'season', 'gave', 'Season', '6', 'two', 'stars', 'four', 'give', 'season', 'represent', 'MARKED', 'improvement', 'EVERYTHING', 'first', 'Terri', 'season', 'cast', 'really', 'get', 'groove', 'introduction', 'Jack', 'restaurant', 'GREAT', 'new', 'scenario', 'provided', 'much-needed', 'direction', 'show', 'very', 'pleasing', 'results', 'Season', '7', 'will', 'attest', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'spend', 'time', 'establishing', 'Jack', 'getting', 'set', 'up', 'new', 'restaurant', 'varied', 'results', 'last', 'two', 'discs', 'season', 'are', 'where', 'bulk', 'truly', 'funny', 'episodes', 'lie', 'two', 'favorites', 'would', 'be', 'disc', '3', 'Starstruck', 'where', 'famous', 'soap', 'star', 'marry', 'Terri', 'girls', 'are', 'just', 'fire', 'Terri', 'exactly', 'how', 'star', 'asked', 'marry', 'Janet', 'enrapt', 'chemistry', 'marvoulous', 'really', 'felt', 'cast', 'had', 'become', 'one', 'point', 'ghost', 'Chrissy', 'was', 'longer', 'dogging', 'Terri', 'heels', 'Chrissy', 'still', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'blond', 'side', 'Jack', 'Double', 'Date', 'Jack', 'bet', 'girls', 'wo', ""n't"", 'date', 'women', 'week', 'somehow', 'talked', 'taking', 'depressed', 'Furley', 'down', 'Beagle', 'singles', 'night', 'What', 'bulk', 'Season', '7', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'writing', 'again', 'become', 'clever', 'scenarios', 'ever', 'beset', 'Three', 'Company', ""'misunderstanding"", 'lot', 'other', 'forces', 'working', 'as', 'well', 'Angelino', 'villainous', 'boss', 'part', 'well', 'Furley', 'really', 'better', 'ever', 'lot', 'on-screen', 'time', 'fair', 'few', 'stories', 'wrapped', 'mostly', 'hilarious', 'effect', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'where', 'writing', 'best', 'beginning', 'episodes', 'example', 'was', ""n't"", 'overly', 'impressed', 'stint', 'restaurant', 'Jack', 'kitchen', 'help', 'tried', 'put', 'up', 'wallpaper', 'kept', 'coming', 'down', 'just', 'slapstick', 'can', 'take', 'slapstick', 'so', 'long', 'are', 'other', 'elements', 'situation', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'slapstick', 'alone', 'ai', ""n't"", 'enough', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'will', 'attest', 'to.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'purchased', 'season', 'Three', 'Company', 'same', 'time', 'bought', 'Season', '6', 'was', 'about', 'ready', 'give', 'up', 'show', 'Season', '6', ""'d"", 'begun', 'suspect', 'show', 'had', 'died', 'fond', 'memories', 'Terri', 'years', 'were', 'error', 'childhood', 'imagination', 'was', 'great', 'surprise', 'found', 'Season', '7', 'getting', 'back', 'feet', 'making', 'laugh', 'GREAT', 'season', 'Three', 'Company', 'saga', 'recommend', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'having', 'doubts', 'due', 'weakness', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'best', '5', 'stars', 'first', 'half', 'varied', 'leaning', 'towards', 'better', 'rather', 'worse', '4', 'stars', 'will', 'be', 'picking', 'up', 'Season', '8']",N/A

I think that Three's Company was one of the few shows out there that have managed to remain consistently strong and funny, despite major cast change. I love every season and i dont think that Chrissy's departure diminished the show in any way. All the characters that followed, Cindy and then the delightful Terri as well as Mr. Furley, only added to the show. The chemistry between Jack, Janet and Chrissy was great but so was the chemistry between Jack, Janet and Cindy and then Jack, Janet and Terri. While it was sad the Ropers left at the end of season 3, the addition of Don Knotts was a brilliant casting choice and I cant imagine anyone fitting in there better than he did. I love Mr. Furley.I was actually a little relieved to see Suzanne Somers go. Her role, by season 4, had been reduced  to that of a ditsy, borderline retarded airhead engaging in clownish buffoonery. Cindy was refreshing and I did enjoy Terri a whole lot: she totally fit into the dynamic and chemistry established by Jack and Janet and she was warm, funny, smart and very likable. She never felt awkward or as if she was just a newbie.I also dont think that Terri had a reduced role in seasons 7 and 8. In fact, if people hadnt pointed it out in the reviews, I wouldnt have noticed. Behind the scene politics have no place in reviews really, especially if those have nothing to do with the content and quality of the show. Who cares how the producers treated Terri: the show was still hilarious and strong. Dispute between cast members and the creative talent and network execs are also quite common and nothing unique to Three's Company. In fact, you wont be able to find a show out there where a cast member wasnt happy with the writers and producers at some point. So bringing that up in the reviews doesnt make sense to me. Same with Chrissy: as an actress, Suzanne Somers was pretty new to the scene and after only 4 years of success in one TV show she became overconfident and demanded ridiculous pay and the producers cut her off. So what?Three's Company is a warm and hilarious show that I could watch over and over again if I just want to log off from real life and have some down time with likable characters and light as air story lines. This show brings back a certain nostalgia from the late 70s/early 80s that felt fun, warm, and engaging. It is positive and bubbly with immensely talented actors who truly inhabiting their roles and are extremely likable. I think ""Three's Company"" is the only show I can think of that did not go bad in the later seasons and in fact managed to remain consistently strong quality wise.
