1067634,A398SM0LR6KLZO,B000OZ2CTS,Aion,"[0, 0]","Note: This review is ONLY FOR THE FIRST SEASON.After managing to get the OOP box set for 26, I started watching my Vandread DVDs a few days ago.After watching the first season, while happy with the quality of the series for what I paid, the shallowness of Vandread makes me happy I didn't pay a huge amount for it.Plot: 7/10Women are an alien species: We men already know this much already. Vandread takes what we know a step further, really making men and women aliens by putting them on different planets.At the start of the series, the men of Taraak and women of Mejere were about to start a war. The men got fed up of a group of women space pirates and decided to put a stop to them, unleashing a new battleship against them. However, much to the dismay of the men, the launch of the battleship went badly, the women space pirates stealing the ship.During all this, a young 3rd class worker, Hibiki, decided to sneak onto the battleship to steal a Vanguard (male mecha) part, ending up getting stuck on board when it launched. He soon found himself thrown in the brig by the men, just before the women attacked.After the women took over the ship, the men decided to destroy it rather than let the women have it by firing missiles at the ship. This resulted in the ship *somehow* blocking the missiles and getting sent to a distant part of the galaxy. The men and women on board the battleship then had to start working together since they soon discovered a new alien race that wants to ""harvest"" humans...----The plot did have a lot of potential. If taken seriously, a plot involving a war of the sexes could have been amazing... If turned into a comedy, it had the potential to be insanely funny. Sadly, however, Vandread turned out to be light-hearted, shallow and not very funny.The plot does not develop much at all once the Nirvana (the battleship mentioned previously) gets warped to a distant part of the galaxy. The crew face battles against their new alien enemy, known only as ""harvesters"", go down to the mostly deserted planets they pass for supplies, fight with each other, play with each other... Episodic stuff.It's really quite disappointing that the series was taken in such a light-hearted direction when it would've worked much better as a more adult series.Characters: 7.5/10The characters, while not exactly being deep or unique, saved the show from being bad.The main character of Vandread is Hibiki, a young male who wants to prove himself. He's simple minded, direct, bad tempered... The type of lead you see in shounen series on a regular basis. Truth be told, he isn't very interesting, with no background details revealed outside of him being a 3rd class citizen; no depth.Dita, the female lead, was much more likeable. She insists on calling Hibiki ""Mr. Alien"", following him around everywhere due to being curious about the male gender and generally annoying the hell out of Hibiki. She was the most funny character in the first season and by far my favourite, if only for being a redhead.The other 2 female main characters, Jura and Meia, were less interesting. Jura is your stereotypical flirtatious woman and Meia is your stereotypical military type, hiding her emotions and commanding the others in battle. Meia had the most development (not that that's saying much...) in the first series since her past has been revealed, but the sequence about her past wasn't designed very well and had little to no impact on me.The other 3 characters I found to be interesting are male: Bart, a wimpy guy who ended up steering the ship since only a male can, the male doctor Duero and Rabat, a Han Solo type. Rabat will hopefully get fleshed out in the 2nd series, him being one of the few intriguing characters.Art/Animation: 9/10For a show that aired back in 2000, Vandread most certainly looks impressive. It was a rather nice surprise to discover that the the DVDs are in widescreen format.There was no obvious corner cutting on the art and animation side during the first season; everything looked smooth and nice to look at. The colours made everything look bright and eye catching.CG is used for all of the space battles in Vandread. I'm sure it looked amazing back when Vandread originally aired, but the CG sections haven't survived the test of time and don't impress in this day and age. I didn't really like the speed the CG battles went at since I found it hard to follow what was going on a lot of time... I suppose the idea was to make the CG battles as fast-paced as possible in order to impress more.Overall, Vandread looks excellent for its age.Sound: 5/10The soundtrack was more distracting than anything. The person who created the soundtrack deserves to be shot... That's all there is to say really.The OP/ED were pretty good. Nothing too memorable but the themes made watching the OP/ED animation more enjoyable.As ever with Japanese voice acting, the performances were mostly excellent. There was no noticeable bad performances.Total: 7.3/10Enjoyable yet disappointing, Vandread is a great show to watch to pass time. Just don't go into it expecting to see the best anime of all time.",4,Women = Aliens,1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,5131,"['Note', 'review', 'ONLY', 'FOR', 'THE', 'FIRST', 'SEASON.After', 'managing',

It's really quite a shame that Gonzo's shows no longer have the quality that this show has. This complete collection comes with both seasons of Vandread and is packaged in a pretty neat little case. The story of vandread is pretty simple and because of that it's easy to get into. The animation is pretty solid coming from a show from 2000, although the 3D CG scenes look rather dated now, in terms of look this show still looks quite solid.

It was a great ending and action and just so funny with men and women both unknown to each other.I never saw something like that. I saw this series when it first came out but I went back and saw this series again a few weeks ago. Dudes I could not stop watching this and laughing, so much fun to watch this series again. I'm glad I did sometimes you may feel that anime is starting to lose your interest, so I think you need to watch this to pick you right back up. I love the entire series, though 13 episodes for the 1st Stage & 13 episodes for the 2nd Stage. So why couldn't they just make it a entire series. It's still a awesome series the music is ok in the begining for the series but crashes and burns in the 2nd stage begining theme and ending theme.

1067637,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B000OZ2CTS,trashcanman,"[8, 9]","Quite an original idea for an animated series I must say.  When humanity leaves earth men and women decide to go their seperate ways and the eventual result, of course, is war.  Men are taught to believe that women are heartless, evil monsters and that is where we begin.  When our male protagonists' ship is attacked by a group of fearsome female pirates the star of the show, Hibiki, is captured along with two others and brought aboard the ship ""Nirvana"".  Having never encountered each other before, the men and women are about to get a serious education that may change the universe as they know it.  ""Vandread"" is a fantastic series about the lack of understanding between the two genders. The men's world is a practical one, bland and macho with only tastless military rations to eat and the soldiers fight in vanguards, powerful flying robots.  The women, on the other hand, are obsessed with aesthetics, serve their crew home-cooked meals, and fly elegant spaceships, dreadnaughts, into battle.  There is a great episode where Hibiki and his main love interest, the adorably ditzy Dita, are seen by the crew's spy in an out of context situation where Dita is crying.  Soon, the whole ship is in an uproar when the gossip spreads and the situation is blown entirely out of proportion as the story is retold and reinterpretted through every girl on the ship.  Hibiki is absolutely dumbstruck at this phenomenon, being that men don't gossip in this way, and the result is a hilarious episode that riffs on the differences between male and female communication. Much of the first half of the series is like this; men and women discovering each other and the misunderstandings that come from their inherent differences.  Soon, however, a malevolent galactic entity is discovered by our heroines and the fight is on to warn both men and women of the common foe that threatens their very existence.  With the two sides unwilling to talk, it falls on the small alliance of the pirate crew and their captives to battle this force until the two sides can be convinced of their need to cooperate.  The Nirvana's crew has a secret weapon: when Hibiki's vanguard combines with a girl's dreadnaught the result is a superpowered vehicle dubbed (say it with me, now) ""vandread"".  The vandread serves it's purpose as an allegory for male/female cooperation and as a metaphor for sex nicely.  The space battles are done is an interesting CG style that was a bit clumsy in season one, but for ""Second Stage"" the animation for these scenes received a massive upgrade.  Sadly, the best stories were in the first season though there are some pretty massive twists in the second. Overall I wouldn't miss this series, it's full of colorful characters, situational comedy, giant robot and spaceship action, and plenty of illustrations about why men and women just don't get each other, but nontheless need each other.  It's a one of a kind series and a lot of fun.",5,The battle of the sexes goes galactic,1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,2948,"['original', 'idea', 'animated', 'series', 'must', 'say', 'When', 'humanity', 'earth', 'men', 'women', 'decide', 'go', 'seperate', 'ways', 'eventual', 'result', 'course', 'war', 'Men', 'are', 'taught', 'believe', 'women', 'are', 'heartless', 'evil', 'monsters', 'where', 'begin', 'When', 'male', 'protagonists', 'ship', 'attacked', 'group', 'fearsome', 'female', 'star', 'show', 'Hibiki', 'captured', 'two', 'others', 'brought', 'ship', 'Nirvana', 'Having', 'never', 'encountered', 'other', 'before', 'men', 'women', 'are', 'get', 'serious', 'education', 'may', 'change', 'universe', 'know', 'Vandread', 'fantastic', 'series', 'lack', 'understanding', 'two', 'genders', 'men', 'world', 'practical', 'one', 'bland', 'macho', 'only', 'tastless', 'military', 'rations', 'eat', 'soldiers', 'fight', 'vanguards', 'powerful', 'flying', 'robots', 'women', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'obsessed', 'aesthetics', 'serve', 'crew', 'home-cooked', 'meals', 'fly', 'elegant', 'spaceships', 'dreadnaughts', 'battle', 'great', 'episode', 'where', 'Hibiki', 'main', 'love', 'interest', 'adorably', 'ditzy', 'Dita', 'are', 'seen', 'crew', 'spy', 'out', 'context', 'situation', 'where', 'Dita', 'crying', 'Soon', 'whole', 'ship', 'uproar', 'when', 'gossip', 'spreads', 'situation', 'blown', 'entirely', 'proportion', 'story', 'retold', 'reinterpretted', 'girl', 'ship', 'Hibiki', 'absolutely', 'dumbstruck', 'phenomenon', 'being', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'gossip', 'way', 'result', 'hilarious', 'episode', 'differences', 'male', 'female', 'communication', 'Much', 'first', 'half', 'series', 'men', 'women', 'discovering', 'other', 'misunderstandings', 'come', 'inherent', 'differences', 'Soon', 'however', 'malevolent', 'galactic', 'entity', 'discovered', 'heroines', 'fight', 'warn', 'men', 'women', 'common', 'foe', 'very', 'existence', 'two', 'sides', 'unwilling', 'talk', 'small', 'alliance', 'pirate', 'crew', 'captives', 'battle', 'force', 'two', 'sides', 'can', 'be', 'convinced', 'need', 'cooperate', 'Nirvana', 'crew', 'secret', 'weapon', 'when', 'Hibiki', 'vanguard', 'combines', 'girl', 'dreadnaught', 'result', 'superpowered', 'vehicle', 'dubbed', 'say', 'now', 'vandread', 'vandread', 'purpose', 'allegory', 'male/female', 'cooperation', 'metaphor', 'sex', 'nicely', 'space', 'battles', 'are', 'done', 'interesting', 'CG', 'style', 'was', 'bit', 'clumsy', 'season', 'one', 'Second', 'Stage', 'animation', 'scenes', 'received', 'massive', 'upgrade', 'Sadly', 'best', 'stories', 'were', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'pretty', 'massive', 'twists', 'second', 'Overall', 'would', ""n't"", 'miss', 'series', 'full', 'colorful', 'characters', 'situational', 'comedy', 'giant', 'robot', 'spaceship', 'action', 'plenty', 'illustrations', 'why', 'men', 'women', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'other', 'nontheless', 'need', 'other', 'one', 'kind', 'series', 'lot', 'fun']",Vandread and Vandread the Second Stage: Complete Collection
