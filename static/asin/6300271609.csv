I wish they would bring it out on DVD.This story is about a doctor (Wahl) that enlists in the service during war time in what seems to be an escape from the life that he was leading.  He is engaged to be married and is set up to have his own practice when he gets home.  She (Ladd) is a nurse that he meets after transporting a critical patient to the area hospital.  There is instant attraction between them.  He starts to take some risks in order to be able to see her.  He also risks his life in order to spend some R&R; time with her.  He realizes that he never really loved his fiance and falls in love with her (Ladd).It is a wonderful film and depicts some of the many hardships and heartbreaks of war.  The acting is a little hammy at times, however the storyline is fabulous.  I would highly recommend watching this film.",5,Great love story!,1169596800,"01 24, 2007",2007,945,"['love', 'story', 'war', 'story', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'war', 'movies', 'however', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'wish', 'would', 'bring', 'out', 'DVD.This', 'story', 'doctor', 'Wahl', 'service', 'war', 'time', 'what', 'be', 'escape', 'life', 'was', 'leading', 'engaged', 'be', 'married', 'set', 'up', 'have', 'own', 'practice', 'when', 'home', 'Ladd', 'nurse', 'transporting', 'critical', 'patient', 'area', 'hospital', 'instant', 'attraction', 'take', 'risks', 'order', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'also', 'life', 'order', 'spend', 'R', 'R', 'time', 'never', 'really', 'loved', 'fiance', 'love', 'Ladd', '.It', 'wonderful', 'film', 'many', 'hardships', 'heartbreaks', 'war', 'acting', 'little', 'hammy', 'times', 'however', 'storyline', 'fabulous', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film']",N/A

To begin, it's just a really good story which pulls you right into all the action.  It quite realistically depicts the war and the various relationships and life in a war zone (my husband found it quite authentic), and best of all it's a wonderful, rich love story with an ending which takes my breath away every single time I watch it.  Unlike  so many Vietnam war movies of the era, it does NOT indulge in the usual Hollywood anti-war bashing.  It tells it like it was in terms of the war, it's honest, but the main thing in this film is the story and the characters--all great and totally believable, and the Vietnam war is the dramatic backdrop without the typical negative agenda.  This is really not at all a ""chick flick"" in any way, but it's a love story with very compelling war action and overall it is very appealing to both men and women.

(which I happen to enjoy too) But, and this is where things take a turn toward the interesting, this film properly portrays several elements of the US military during the Vietnam War. Including what I consider an incredibly detailed Navy Seal Ops unit, both in characterization and temperament. It borders on the bizarre that such a nugget of special ops combat would be hidden inside a romantic flick.Their mission, of course, is based on the real life US Army Special Forces rescue operation/raid on Son Tay Prison. But the effect is amazing. A sort of ""what if"" had the Navy been tasked with the rescue.Additionally, the hilltop firebase and field hospital scenes were again surprisingly realistic. As well as the actions of the personnel on the naval hospital ship. I'm not sure who the advisors to the movie were, but their on-hand knowledge were well used by both the director and cinematographer.This was at the height of star Ken Wahl's career - so it comes as a sad reminder of careers that 'could-have-been'. The acting is well done and the romance with beautiful Cheryl Ladd very tangible.Finally, kudos to Lane Smith who portrays the by-the-book Navy doctor, Commander Markel - and R.

Women may balk at the violence and wonder how anyone could call it a chick-flick to begin with. Well, it has a love story, and for us guys this is about as close as we want to get to that!To summarize briefly, Ken Wahl meets Cheryl Ladd and they click. Most of the clicking is probably due to the horrific nature of the war. But through circumstance and opportunity this love grows. Then through explosions and death the story progresses to an ending that even guys will agree is acceptable. I know I did.I first saw this movie overseas a couple of decades ago on a VHS rip off of a laser disc. At some point I craved seeing it again and bought the VHS version from Amazon. As soon as it comes out on DVD (fingers crossed) I'll buy that as well. This is a movie I consider a keeper. It has a good story and some good war-type violence.
