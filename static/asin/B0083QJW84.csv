1545369,A3O5LP49BDCKFQ,B0083QJW84,Ashlem,"[11, 17]","Short version: This harem anime series is similar to other anime shows such as Rosario + Vampire, Demon King Daimao, and Nyan Koi. If you liked those series, you'll probably enjoy this one.---------Ayumu Aikawa was just an ordinary high school student, until one day he was murdered by a serial killer roaming his city. Fortunately for him, a necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe (commonly referred to as ""Yuu"" or ""Eu"") resurrects him as a zombie, which in this series means he can't die, has no more biological restrictions on using his punches (meaning he can punch much harder than regular people), and shrivels in direct sunlight. As he searches for the serial killer, he meets up with several more characters, a magical girl named Haruna (whose powers he accidentally steals, later causing him to be a magical girl as well, complete with a pink chainsaw), a vampire ninja named Seraphim, and later another vampire ninja named Tomonori/Maelstrom. He is forced to divide his time between taking care of the women and his mission, as well as attending his school and keeping his human classmates, such as his friend Orito, in the dark about the supernatural elements in his life.Basically this is a harem anime series, where one guy lives with several women, with a lot of ecchi (hints of sexuality such as big busty boobs in revealing clothing) elements. The plot is paper thin for most of the episodes, but I found the interactions among the characters to be pretty amusing and entertaining, whether it's Ayumu getting embarassed at school, getting beat up by one of the girls for peeking at them (or them getting embarrassed because they saw him in a dream, and beating him up), or just spending some quality time at home with his friends decorating for the holidays, shopping, or just eating at the dinner table.For all the comedy in it, there are some more serious dramatic moments, such as the face-off with the serial killer about halfway through the series, and the fight at the end with the big bad boss who's causing all the trouble in town. There is a lot of bloodshed and violence, but most of it is played for comedy, and Ayumu does get injured quite a bit, including getting sawed in half (and later blown up by a bomb), but again, because of his zombie status he simply reattaches himself later (or in the case of the bomb, his friends gather his pieces for him). Other than the megalo (demons), nobody really ever dies in this series, and most of them just walk it off.",4,Pretty good harem series,1338336000,"05 30, 2012",2012,2489,"['Short', 'version', 'harem', 'anime', 'series', 'similar', 'other', 'anime', 'shows', 'such', 'Rosario', '+', 'Vampire', 'Demon', 'King', 'Daimao', 'Nyan', 'Koi', 'liked', 'series', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'one.', '-Ayumu', 'Aikawa', 'was', 'just', 'ordinary', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'one', 'day', 'was', 'murdered', 'serial', 'killer', 'roaming', 'city', 'Fortunately', 'necromancer', 'named', 'Eucliwood', 'Hellscythe', 'commonly', 'referred', 'Yuu', 'Eu', 'zombie', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'die', 'more', 'biological', 'restrictions', 'using', 'punches', 'meaning', 'can', 'punch', 'much', 'harder', 'regular', 'people', 'shrivels', 'direct', 'sunlight', 'serial', 'killer', 'up', 'several', 'more', 'characters', 'magical', 'girl', 'named', 'Haruna', 'powers', 'accidentally', 'later', 'causing', 'be', 'magical', 'girl', 'as', 'well', 'complete', 'pink', 'chainsaw', 'vampire', 'ninja', 'named', 'Seraphim', 'later', 'vampire', 'ninja', 'named', 'Tomonori/Maelstrom', 'forced', 'divide', 'time', 'taking', 'care', 'women', 'mission', 'as', 'well', 'attending', 'school', 'keeping', 'human', 'classmates', 'such', 'friend', 'Orito', 'dark', 'supernatural', 'elements', 'life.Basically', 'harem', 'anime', 'series', 'where', 'one', 'guy', 'several', 'women', 'lot', 'ecchi', 'hints', 'sexuality', 'such', 'big', 'busty', 'boobs', 'revealing', 'clothing', 'elements', 'plot', 'paper', 'thin', 'most', 'episodes', 'found', 'interactions', 'characters', 'be', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'entertaining', 'Ayumu', 'getting', 'embarassed', 'school', 'getting', 'beat', 'up', 'one', 'girls', 'peeking', 'getting', 'embarrassed', 'saw', 'dream', 'beating', 'up', 'just', 'spending', 'quality', 'time', 'home', 'friends', 'decorating', 'holidays', 'shopping', 'just', 'eating', 'dinner', 'comedy', 'are', 'more', 'serious', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'such', 'face-off', 'serial', 'killer', 'halfway', 'series', 'fight', 'end', 'big', 'bad', 'boss', 'who', 'causing', 'trouble', 'town', 'lot', 'bloodshed', 'violence', 'most', 'played', 'comedy', 'Ayumu', 'get', 'injured', 'quite', 'bit', 'including', 'getting', 'sawed', 'half', 'later', 'blown', 'up', 'bomb', 'again', 'zombie', 'status', 'simply', 'later', 'case', 'bomb', 'friends', 'gather', 'pieces', 'Other', 'megalo', 'demons', 'nobody', 'really', 'ever', 'series', 'most', 'just', 'walk', 'off']",N/A

The characters are immediately hilarious, you start off with a young male highschool student Ayumu Aikawa who one night befriends a wayward young girl Eucliwood Hellscythe who he tries to help during a life threatening situation which unfortunately ends his life for a time.Eucliwood turns out to be a necromancer and brings young Ayumu back to relative life if you can call being a free thinking zombie living.  Though Ayumu doesn't need or want to even think about eating human fresh or brains(Thankful that he can eat regular food)Ayumu tries to live his life for the most part just like before though now with more problems then usual. Also along the way we get two other female characters a young sorceress Haruna who while being a skilled fighter is very dangerous both to her enemies and friends when using her primary weapon a magical chainsaw. Then we have a well endowed though somewhat snobby vampire ninja named Seraphim with hopes of serving Eucliwood but after the young necromancer rejects the offer Seraphim offers to become the snobby servant to Ayumu so that she may stay near Eucliwood.The animation may have some people actually thinking a little bit if the mentioned My Bride is a Mermaid as you can see some similarity between them,also the voice cast for the English dubbed and Japanese subbed did a terrific job voicing their characters in the series.  While later in the series you'll see more of the harem sub-plot angle come out though not to early as some of the females that make the harem won't be showing their attraction to young Ayumu from the start. Sadly while there is a second season that actually stopped around mid 2012 so at most for the fans in the States will have to most likely wait until near the end of 2013 to get that set.  Still for the hilarity you'll get from this set I'm sure it'll keep you more then entertained until then.",5,A Very Hilarious Comedic Twist On The Personal Viewpoint Of One Of The Undead,1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,2067,"['comedic', 'hilarity', 'series', 'be', 'nice', 'mixture', 'Soul', 'Eater', 'My', 'Bride', 'Mermaid', 'good', 'touch', 'fan', 'service', 'gore', 'entertain', 'sides', 'genre', 'characters', 'are', 'immediately', 'hilarious', 'start', 'young', 'male', 'highschool', 'student', 'Ayumu', 'Aikawa', 'who', 'one', 'night', 'wayward', 'young', 'girl', 'Eucliwood', 'Hellscythe', 'who', 'help', 'life', 'threatening', 'situation', 'unfortunately', 'life', 'time.Eucliwood', 'out', 'be', 'necromancer', 'young', 'Ayumu', 'back', 'relative', 'life', 'can', 'call', 'being', 'free', 'thinking', 'zombie', 'living', 'Ayumu', ""n't"", 'need', 'want', 'even', 'think', 'eating', 'human', 'fresh', 'brains', 'Thankful', 'can', 'eat', 'regular', 'food', 'Ayumu', 'live', 'life', 'most', 'part', 'just', 'now', 'more', 'problems', 'then', 'usual', 'Also', 'way', 'get', 'two', 'other', 'female', 'characters', 'young', 'sorceress', 'Haruna', 'who', 'being', 'skilled', 'fighter', 'very', 'dangerous', 'enemies', 'friends', 'when', 'using', 'primary', 'weapon', 'magical', 'chainsaw', 'Then', 'have', 'well', 'endowed', 'somewhat', 'snobby', 'vampire', 'ninja', 'named', 'Seraphim', 'hopes', 'serving', 'Eucliwood', 'young', 'necromancer', 'offer', 'Seraphim', 'become', 'snobby', 'servant', 'Ayumu', 'may', 'stay', 'Eucliwood.The', 'animation', 'may', 'have', 'people', 'actually', 'thinking', 'little', 'bit', 'mentioned', 'My', 'Bride', 'Mermaid', 'can', 'see', 'similarity', 'also', 'voice', 'cast', 'English', 'dubbed', 'Japanese', 'subbed', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'voicing', 'characters', 'series', 'later', 'series', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', 'harem', 'sub-plot', 'angle', 'come', 'out', 'not', 'early', 'females', 'make', 'harem', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'showing', 'attraction', 'young', 'Ayumu', 'start', 'Sadly', 'second', 'season', 'actually', 'stopped', 'mid', '2012', 'so', 'most', 'fans', 'States', 'will', 'have', 'most', 'likely', 'wait', 'end', '2013', 'get', 'set', 'Still', 'hilarity', ""'ll"", 'get', 'set', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'more', 'then', 'entertained', 'then']",N/A
