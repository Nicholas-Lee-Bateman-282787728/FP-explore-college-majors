This show might not be liked by everybody because of the sexual jokes, but I love it. The cast works together amazingly, and my favorite character is Sophie, she's always doing bizarre things and she's a fan favorite character. In this season, the story moves on a little bit quicker, it's mainly about the girls finally opening her cupcake business, but at the end it moves right where it started.The jokes are always funny, and the way Kat and Beth have their chemistry is just great!

There were a few moments that were off-color or not so great, but overall, the characters continue to be interesting and likable. The season starts out with cupcake shop which eventually goes under leading to a shift in focus for the stories. In some ways, it's a nice change of pace although it leaves the show without a clear direction for a bit. The acting isn't necessarily the best on TV, but somehow the characters all fit. The one thing about this season that was a little different was that the relationship between the two main characters was a bit edgier at times.
