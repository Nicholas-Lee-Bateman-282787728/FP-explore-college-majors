It was an effort, and it probably worked really well at the box office of the day.  I got what I expected - an historical documentation of the early attempts to show the plight of the American Indians, the adventure loving man who cannot be fully tamed, and the woman who finds that she can indeed use her brain to earn a living and make a difference in society.  The unexpected inclusion to the &#34;man moving to the frontier&#34; was the Southern beginning of the film with the slaves being presented so stereotypically as faithful and childlike - one young black boy stowed away on the wagon to go to Oklahoma with the master because he was treated more kindly by the star, but as the child was a part of the land rush and was growing well in the new environment, he became a casualty of a gun fight in the street.  The illustrious hero became a bum and was gone from his wife for nearly three decades before she is elected as the first congresswoman and celebrates forty years of newspaper editing.  The old pioneer man dies in her arms after saving several men in a mine cave in.

279362,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6301967720,Annie Van Auken,"[4, 5]","CIMARRON is a film that all classic cinema fans should see at least once. The opening sequence of the 1889 Oklahoma Territory Land Rush is still quite remarkable, and the early struggles of the townspeople of Osage well-rendered. This feels and looks much like a silent movie, but has the benefit of sound. You can clearly see why CIMARRON won the Best Picture Oscar, even at a distance of 75 years.Much criticism has been given Richard Dix for his larger-than-life portrayal of this story's ostensible hero, Yancy Cravat. Leonard Maltin for one called Dix's acting ""overripe."" I couldn't disagree more. Dix's traveling stageshow technique is most appropriate for the times depicted. That being said, I came away disliking Yancey because he was a selfish individual who put his own wants above the needs of his family.The story unfolds episodically in the years 1889, 1890, 1893, 1898, 1907, 1929 and 1930. Early on, Cravat fares best with viewers. He helps establish the town of Osage, saves lives with his gunslinging and kills several bad guys. But then the wanderlust takes hold and Yancey leaves behind his small family and wife Sabra, who must run the fledgling newspaper Yancey founded all alone.The gadabout reappears five years later, and hangs around long enough to defend in court the town floozy against all the ""decent womenfolk,"" including his own humiliated wife. Then Cravat is gone again, this time for a decade! But for some mysterious reason, his wife stays loyal, passively awaiting his return.In 1907, the now middle-aged wanderer is back-- no explanations given. Yancey soon after clashes with Sabra over the content of an editorial, then haughtily proclaims that HE is the editor of the newspaper he hasn't been a part of for 13 years, and the editorial would read as he wants it to! Sabra gives in quietly.Do you think this guy would stay home now that he was older? Uh-uh. THIS time, Cravat vanishes without a trace for 23 years, and still Sabra waits for him. At movie's end, the elderly Cravat performs one last heroic act and his wife finds him just as he's ready to expire. The man's good qualities hardly compensate for the bad. Had I been Sabra, the first time Yancey abandoned me would have been the last. Were women that different 100 years ago? Was there no sense of self-esteem?The true hero of CIMARRON is Sabra Cravat, who raised two children, successfully ran and grew a newspaper and ended up in Congress only a decade after women were given the right to vote. Edna Ferber's skillful storytelling assures you could never doubt the depth of this woman's courage and dedication for even a moment.",4,Yancey Cravat - Good guy or gadabout?

279368,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6301967720,calvinnme,"[3, 6]","Cimarron was an early talkie that made great strides in sound, allowing natural interaction between the cast and a more natural movement of the camera, allowing the filming of some truly spectacular scenes.The shots of the Oklahoma Land Rush stampede involve ground-breaking sound and cinematography that make it one of the most realistically shot scenes up to that time. Other well filmed scenes include those of Osage's dusty streets with the camera tracking the main characters as they walk along while hundreds of extras bustle about them, showing the life of a busy boom town shortly after the land rush. Unfortunately, this is pretty much where my praise of this film ends.This film stars Richard Dix as Yancey Cravat, a man who was born under a wandering star. Unfortunately, that didn't stop Yancey from taking a wife and having children, it just stopped him from taking any responsibility for that same wife and children. Through the years, Yancey chases one hair-brained scheme after another while his long-suffering wife Sabra (Irene Dunne) takes responsibility for the newspaper Yancey started but abandons time and again. Sometimes Yancey's adventures keep him home, other times they take him away for years at a time. The film focuses on Yancey's adventures, while the whole time I'm wondering what Sabra is up to. In modern times, her story is much more compelling and sympathetic.Richard Dix's performance is quite hammy by modern standards. You'll find yourself laughing in places that were not intended to be funny by the film's creators, and in spite of your laughter, you'll still find Yancey to be completely unlikeable. He would make a great politician in the 21st century - he is very apt at doing one thing, saying another, and still finding time for splendid oratory. The worst thing about this film, which was not unusual for its day, was the stereotyped rendition of Cravat's servant Isaiah. For example, in one scene Isaiah gets very excited when Yancey points out a cart full of watermelons. Usually I can put this sort of thing in the context of the times in which the film was made, but this material really goes the extra mile in being cringeworthy.There are two extras on the DVD. First there's a vintage color musical short - `The Devil's Cabaret' - which is an example of something that could only have been done pre-code. At ""Satan & Co., Inc."", the Devil is upset because too many people are going up to Heaven rather than down to Hades. He gives his assistant, Mr. Burns the task of getting more people to his domain. In front of a nightclub, Mr. Burns invites a crowd of people to come inside to ""The Devil's Cabaret"" and be entertained. After they enjoy songs and dancing, the people go willingly to Hades. To me, this early Technicolor short was more entertaining than the movie. The second extra feature is an early Merry Melodie cartoon entitled `Red-Headed Baby'. There are no extras related to the film itself.Remarkably, this film won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1931. Even more remarkably, Richard Dix was nominated for Best Actor for his performance in this film. Less remarkably, Irene Dunne was nominated for Best Actress for her performance, in spite of the lack of depth of the examination of her character in the film. There are two reasons to watch this film (a) To see the very good technical achievements it featured in sound and cinematography (b) To see the very bad things about it including Dix' hammy performance, the stereotypes that were common in films of that era, and the fact that in the early twentieth century nobody apparently thought that the long-suffering Sabra was doing anything other than her duty as a wife in spending most of her time waiting for her husband to come home from his misadventures.This release of ""Cimarron"" is just a repackaged version of the previous DVD release.

279373,A27ZOCD5B63Y0P,6301967720,"D. Collier ""Shelf-Help""","[9, 9]","I decided that I wanted to watch all the Best Picture Academy Award-winning films from the very first one.  Unfortunately, like many of my generation, the older a movie is, the less I can tolerate it.  This is not something I'm proud of, but it's just the way it is.  But I was pleased that CIMARRON was an exception.  It is in fact the oldest film (talkie) I have ever seen all the way through.When I first sat down to watch it, I didn't even  know how to pronounce it: SIMMER-ON.  At the risk of sounding clich&eacute;, CIMARRON is a grand, sweeping epic that spans the time of over forty years.  The plot revolves around Yancey Cravat (Richard Dix) and his wife Sabra (Irene Dunn) and their adventurous life together picking up stakes in Kansas to settle in Oklahoma after the massive land rush.  This part of the film, along with many, many other scenes, was incredibly filmed, especially when one remembers that this was several decades before what we now call computer graphic imagery (something which in my opinion is working very hard on ruining the movie industry).Yancey Cravat is the quintessential Dudley Do-right.  He reminds me of a mixture of Charles Ingalls, Rocky Balboa, and Roy Rogers.  He's the tall, buff, proud man in the White Hat.  He can draw a six-shooter in a blink, fire it with dead aim, print and edit a picture-perfect newspaper, present a jury-convincing impromptu defense argument, deliver a standing-room only church sermon, and stand up for the poor, needy, and under-privileged in a way that would have made Father Flanagan blush.The movie does have a few slow moments, as any great epic might.  But they always pass, and the film is overall very enjoyable.  One thing that struck me as very interesting is that this movie about the Old West was made only a few decades after the time of the Old West.  In fact, many people from that time period were probably around (and might have even lended their advice and insight) when CIMARRON was made.  It would be no different than someone making a movie today about World War II.Many will criticize this movie as politically incorrect.  But the funny thing about political correctness is what is politically correct today will be politically incorrect tomorrow.  The same goes with CIMARRON.  I have no doubt that when this movie first appeared in the early 1930s there were many critics who thought the film was far too-sympathetic toward black citizens and Native American Indians.  It was very rare back then to have such a film.  Now, the scales have tipped toward the other direction, and CIMARRON is not progressive enough.I don't watch movies to be enlightened in a social or political manner.  I watch them for entertainment and for great storytelling purposes.  And for these two reasons I can call CIMARRON a four-star film.",4,When the Old West was much less Old,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,2815,"['decided', 'wanted', 'watch', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'films', 'very', 'first', 'one', 'Unfortunately', 'many', 'generation', 'older', 'movie', 'less', 'can', 'tolerate', 'not', 'something', ""'m"", 'proud', 'just', 'way', 'was', 'pleased', 'CIMARRON', 'was', 'exception', 'fact', 'oldest', 'film', 'talkie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'way', 'through.When', 'first', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'how', 'pronounce', 'SIMMER-ON', 'risk', 'sounding', 'clich', 'eacute', 'CIMARRON', 'grand', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'time', 'forty', 'years', 'plot', 'Yancey', 'Cravat', 'Richard', 'Dix', 'wife', 'Sabra', 'Irene', 'Dunn', 'adventurous', 'life', 'together', 'picking', 'up', 'stakes', 'Kansas', 'settle', 'Oklahoma', 'massive', 'land', 'rush', 'part', 'film', 'many', 'many', 'other', 'scenes', 'was', 'incredibly', 'filmed', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'was', 'several', 'decades', 'what', 'now', 'call', 'computer', 'graphic', 'imagery', 'something', 'opinion', 'working', 'very', 'hard', 'ruining', 'movie', 'industry', '.Yancey', 'Cravat', 'quintessential', 'Dudley', 'Do-right', 'mixture', 'Charles', 'Ingalls', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Roy', 'Rogers', 'tall', 'buff', 'proud', 'man', 'White', 'Hat', 'can', 'draw', 'six-shooter', 'blink', 'fire', 'dead', 'aim', 'print', 'edit', 'picture-perfect', 'newspaper', 'present', 'jury-convincing', 'impromptu', 'defense', 'argument', 'deliver', 'standing-room', 'only', 'church', 'sermon', 'stand', 'up', 'poor', 'needy', 'under-privileged', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Father', 'Flanagan', 'blush.The', 'movie', 'have', 'few', 'slow', 'moments', 'great', 'epic', 'might', 'always', 'pass', 'film', 'overall', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'One', 'thing', 'struck', 'very', 'interesting', 'movie', 'Old', 'West', 'was', 'made', 'only', 'few', 'decades', 'time', 'Old', 'West', 'fact', 'many', 'people', 'time', 'period', 'were', 'probably', 'might', 'have', 'even', 'lended', 'advice', 'insight', 'when', 'CIMARRON', 'was', 'made', 'would', 'be', 'different', 'someone', 'making', 'movie', 'today', 'World', 'War', 'II.Many', 'will', 'criticize', 'movie', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'funny', 'thing', 'political', 'correctness', 'what', 'politically', 'correct', 'today', 'will', 'be', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'tomorrow', 'same', 'CIMARRON', 'have', 'doubt', 'when', 'movie', 'first', 'appeared', 'early', '1930s', 'were', 'many', 'critics', 'who', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'too-sympathetic', 'black', 'citizens', 'Native', 'American', 'Indians', 'was', 'very', 'rare', 'back', 'then', 'have', 'film', 'Now', 'scales', 'have', 'tipped', 'other', 'direction', 'CIMARRON', 'not', 'progressive', 'enough.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movies', 'be', 'enlightened', 'social', 'political', 'manner', 'watch', 'entertainment', 'great', 'storytelling', 'purposes', 'two', 'reasons', 'can', 'call', 'CIMARRON', 'four-star', 'film']",Cimarron VHS
279374,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6301967720,Dr. James Gardner,"[5, 5]","To fully appreciate 1931's ""Cimarron"" a few factors should be noted -Cimarron was made at the start of the talkies era and there's a lot of holdover from the silent era. Indeed, actors like Richard Dix (the hero) and Stanley Fields (the villain) had their heyday in the silent era. So don't be surprised to see a lot of silent film acting and makeup.America in 1931 was still the place for the white Anglo Saxon male, so expect to see minorities (the black servant boy Isaiah, the Indians) portrayed in a servile manner. Though offensive by later standards, their treatment in this film is relatively enlightened. Indeed, the favorable treatment of the marriage of Dix's son to an Indian is a rare progressive element in 30s films where miscegenation is usually met with death.Almost every western film prior to Stagecoach (1939) followed a ""traditional western"" format with a larger than life hero who wore a white hat, damsels in distress that needed saving, and villains who scowled and wore black. Though dated by today's standards, this was pretty ordinary stuff for those days.Westerns were mostly quickly made ""oat burners"" with only an occasional attempt at an epic western  - ""The Covered Wagon (1924), ""The Iron Horse"" (1924), and ""In Old Arizona"" (1929).So ""Cimarron"" was made with nary a chance of success. Epic westerns were rare, the depression was at its height, and most people wanted the see good old-fashioned oat burner.Richard Dix (1893-1949) was RKO's leading man during the 30s. He started in 1917 and had made 50 films prior to talkies. I found his performance engaging, although I can imagine for some people that it appears ""over the top"".Irene Dunne (1898-1990) stars as Dix's wife, Sabra. Dunne was nominated 5 times for an Oscar (""Cimarron"", ""Theodora Goes Wild"", ""The Awful Truth"", ""Love Affair"". ""I Remember Mama"") but never won. She made 40 films between 1930 and 1952 and then transitioned to TV. She does her usual terrific job, and ages very well. Indeed, we eventually come to realize that Dunne is the star of the film, not Dix.Of all the villains from the early cinema, Stanley Fields (1883-1941) was the most consistent. Other prominent villains (Chaney, Beery) went on to play heroic roles, but Fields remained the villain to the end. He made over 100 films from 1929 to 1941. He does his usual excellent job here, although his role is briefThe great Edna May Oliver (1883-1942) plays a friend of Dunne. Oliver is best remembered for her roles as The Red Queen in ""Alice in Wonderland"" (1933) and the nurse in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1936). She was nominated for an Oscar for her role as Mrs. McKlennar in ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939). This is one of her lesser performances.Wesley Ruggles (1889-1972) directs. He was a silent film director who shot to fame with this film, then made a few distinguished films (""I'm no Angel"", ""Bolero"", ""Arizona"") before retiring in 1946 after a string of box office failures.Edward Cronjager (1904-60) provides stunning photography for the first of his 7 Oscar nominations that also included ""Heaven can Wait"" (1943) and ""Beneath the 12 Mile Reef"" (1953). After making 100 films he transitioned to TV where he filmed, among other shows, Sam Peckinpah's ""The Westerner"" (1960).The film won 3 Oscars (Picture, Writing, Art Direction) and was nominated for 4 more (Actor, Actress, Cinematographer, Director) making it the most notable film to that date. The top grossing films that year were ""Frankenstein"", ""Mata Hari"", ""City Lights"", and ""Dracula"". Oscars went to ""The Champ"" (Actor), and ""Min and Bill"" (Actress). Other notable films released that year include ""M"", ""Public Enemy"", ""Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde"", and ""Monkey Business"".The NY Times called it ""a stupendous undertaking"" and said ""from the first to the last scene one is often stirred by this chronicle."" They praised the acting and the direction.1931 was the depth of the depression and not a particularly good time for the movie industry (or any other industry for that matter). The previous year a big budget western ""The Big Trail"" directed by Raoul Walsh and starring John Wayne had bombed at the box office and Wayne and the western in general would be relegated to a decade of B films. So while the film made nearly $1 million at the box office, (coming in at #2 behind Frankenstein)  at a cost of $1.4 million it was a major loss for RKO.Bottom line - This film is certainly worth a look, even if it does seem a bit dated.",4,"Dated, but worth a view",1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,4462,"['fully', 'appreciate', '1931', 'Cimarron', 'few', 'factors', 'should', 'be', 'noted',

279375,A2F89BTWLSEEKF,6301967720,Edward M. Erdelac,"[50, 56]","What are some of these reviewers thinking?  I just watched this movie for the first time, and considering the period, this has got to be one of the most progressive films ever to come out of the 1930's.  Yes, like most, I inwardly cringed at the sight of `Isaiah' whistling and shining shoes during the opening credits, but I really felt that the character wound up being much more than a stereotypical clown (this is NOT Gone With The Wind).  Consider the societal constraints under which the creators of this film worked, and I should think its obvious that they did what they could, perhaps subversively.  Back then they just couldn't have a black character or a full blooded Indian character who spoke for and defended himself, but they could find a way to espouse more liberal views through the character of Cravat.  In the end, by way of his actions, Isaiah certainly becomes a more heroic character than Mammy or Uncle Remus.  Likewise, the treatment of womens' roles and Indian rights are amazingly far ahead of their time -even going so far as to touch on interracial marriage and the potential of women to be stronger and even more efficient than men -which at a time when the suffragists were still alive, has got to be commended.  And don't forget that Dix's character is part Indian.  How many films prior to `Broken Arrow' portrayed Indians in a positive light, let alone made them the hero?There is a lot of talk of Dix's overracting and praise for Dunne.  I thought Dix captured the blustery over the top persona of Yancey Cravat (who was based on a real-life gunslinging attorney who was a son of Sam Houston -the courtroom soliloquy to save the prostitute is culled directly from historic record) perfectly.  I particularly liked the scene where he `crows' at the bad guy in challenge.  Yes, Dunne did a fine job as well portraying a character who represents all the economic and social intolerance of the period.  Moreso because with the help of her firebrand husband she manages to evolve and change (and even become a Congresswoman!) beyond these small views.  But I don't think Dix deserves all the criticism, nor Dunne all the credit. Yancy Cravat doesn't seem true to life because he is BIGGER than life.  Nobody complains about George C. Scott's rendering of Patton, because we know Patton really was that way.  Is it incomprehensible to think that such giant characters, dandily dressed and sporting pistols and purple words ever walked the land before 1930? All this talk of dating (at the risk of sounding dated) is a lot of hooey.  When you watch a movie like this you've got to put yourself in the mindset of the audience of the period, or of course you're always going to think its `aged badly.'The film is shot well.  The Land Rush is great, as is that scene where Dunne runs through the spattered men of the oil field at the end (it reminded me of Claudia Cardinale walking through the slew of rail workers at the end of Once Upon A Time In The West).  There are shots during the emigration of the Cravats from Kansaas which also stay in the mind.  The lantern hanging from the rear axle of the wagon, only illuminating the turning wheels on either side, while Cravat lowly sings his signature tune was a stroke of genius, and the Kid and his gang riding out of the dark and empty land into their campsite is well done.  The sound on the VHS is a little bad, with a lot of background hiss occassionally overwhelming the dialogue.  I hope if this ever gets to DVD they can fix this.I think this is an important film that has been sorely overlooked because of the decline of the western in popular culture and the finger pointing of the PC crowd.  You've got to look deeper than the veneer, but I really believe this to be an astounding achievement historically, cinematically, and in the portrayal and ultimate breaking of racial stereotypes.  Best Picture of 1930.  I would've given it four stars, but the VHS copy isn't great.  O mighty masters of DVD transfer, except Cimarron into thy trust!

I've seen it twice and don't have plans to watch it ever again.  There is only one good sequence in this overlong western: the land rush.  Unfortunately, that's at the beginning of this long epic and what follows is riddled with clich&eacute;s and bad acting.

279384,A3OGMDFM045MQ7,6301967720,Matthew Farrell,"[5, 11]","My girlfriend suggested we start NetFlixing movies that won the Best Film Oscar, hence my introduction to this odd little time capsule from the '30s.This is a film that has not aged well, and let me be clear that I am not referring to things such as its cinemetography, but to its story and character portrayals. There actually is very little plot in this, but it seems to be more of a prolonged character study of the main character, Yancy. Sadly, this is one of the weakest features in the film, as the character is such an unbelievably larger-than-life superman that I found myself at first unable to take him seriously and eventually actively disliking him.Yancy actually reminded me of Captain Kirk, for not only does Richard Dix's over-the-top overacting forshadow Shatner, but Yancey is somehow a master of all trades and situations that he insists on handling himself. The bank's getting robbed? Yancy springs into action and single-handedly stops them. Someone needs a spontaneous sermon? Yancy's the man to give it. Who will come to the (legal) defense of an unjustifiably persecuted strumpet? Yancey's your man. Et cetera, ad nausium. Despite all this (ahem) positive aspects, Yancy is shown (by today's standards) to be an insensitive husband with the attention span of a gnat on crystal meth.In all honesty, one of the reasons the film held my interest was I was curious to see if Yancy would get any kind of ""come-uppance."" Sadly, he doesn't, which makes me think that the producers intended him to be the seriously-taken hero. I'm actually curious to know how he was received by audiences back in the time, if they hated him as much as I did.The film is also racist in its portrayals of African and Native Americans (as well as the one Jewish character in it) though these can probably be excused (though NOT forgiven) as products of the times. You can also say it's somewhat mysogynistic, as Yancy's long-suffering wife is shown to humbly obey and deal with him demurely with almost no sticking up for herself. Again, I'm mildly interested to know if contemporary audiences would have been as put off as my girlfriend and I were.Not recommended, except perhaps as an historical curiosity.",2,"An historical curiosity, perhaps, but little else",1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,2204,"['girlfriend', 'suggested', 'start', 'NetFlixing', 'movies', 'won', 'Best', 'Film', 'Oscar', 'hence', 'introduction', 'odd', 'little', 'time', 'capsule', ""'30s.This"", 'film', 'not', 'aged', 'well', 'let', 'be', 'clear', 'am', 'not', 'referring', 'things', 'such', 'cinemetography', 'story', 'character', 'portrayals', 'actually', 'very', 'little', 'plot', 'be', 'more', 'prolonged', 'character', 'study', 'main', 'character', 'Yancy', 'Sadly', 'one', 'weakest', 'features', 'film', 'character', 'such', 'unbelievably', 'larger-than-life', 'superman', 'found', 'first', 'unable', 'take', 'seriously', 'eventually', 'actively', 'disliking', 'him.Yancy', 'actually', 'reminded', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'not', 'only', 'Richard', 'Dix', 'over-the-top', 'overacting', 'forshadow', 'Shatner', 'Yancey', 'somehow', 'master', 'trades', 'situations', 'handling', 'bank', 'getting', 'robbed', 'Yancy', 'springs', 'action', 'single-handedly', 'stops', 'Someone', 'spontaneous', 'sermon', 'Yancy', 'man', 'give', 'Who', 'will', 'come', 'legal', 'defense', 'unjustifiably', 'persecuted', 'strumpet', 'Yancey', 'man', 'Et', 'cetera', 'ad', 'nausium', 'ahem', 'positive', 'aspects', 'Yancy', 'shown', 'today', 'standards', 'be', 'insensitive', 'husband', 'attention', 'span', 'gnat', 'crystal', 'meth.In', 'honesty', 'one', 'reasons', 'film', 'held', 'interest', 'was', 'was', 'curious', 'see', 'Yancy', 'would', 'get', 'kind', 'come-uppance', 'Sadly', ""n't"", 'think', 'producers', 'intended', 'be', 'seriously-taken', 'hero', ""'m"", 'actually', 'curious', 'know', 'how', 'was', 'received', 'audiences', 'back', 'time', 'hated', 'as', 'much', 'did.The', 'film', 'also', 'racist', 'portrayals', 'African', 'Native', 'Americans', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'Jewish', 'character', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'excused', 'NOT', 'forgiven', 'products', 'times', 'can', 'also', 'say', 'somewhat', 'mysogynistic', 'Yancy', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'shown', 'humbly', 'obey', 'deal', 'demurely', 'almost', 'sticking', 'up', 'herself', 'Again', ""'m"", 'mildly', 'interested', 'know', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'off', 'girlfriend', 'were.Not', 'recommended', 'except', 'perhaps', 'historical', 'curiosity']",Cimarron VHS

There is an odd balance between melodrama and something really substantial, something actually edifying to the viewer.  I think a large part of why this movie doesn't descend into the sludge of cinematic slop is because the characters are all flawed, and in those flaws the viewer cannot help but recognize a touch of human frailty.  Every individual in this movie is at times ridiculous and at other times supremely dignified.  This, I believe, gives it a certain depth.The characters in any great movie MUST be larger than life if the piece is to avoid being either a documentary or a soap opera.

The opening scenes depict the Oklahoma Land Rush which is positively awe inspiring: thousands of extras rush pell-mell on foot, horseback and wagon in a mindless dash to outwit & outride each other in order to gain free land. Much of the movie rests on the considerable talents of Irene Dunne, who goes from an innocent child-woman to a grand old lady in a span of 4O years. Believe it or not, this film was considered to be the cinema's finest Western until the likes of RED RIVER, HIGH NOON and SHANE made their marks.

The screenplay was written by Howard Estabrook, based upon the source novel by Edna Ferber. The film cost RKO 1.5 million dollars to film: it also won Oscars for Best Set Decoration and for Best Adoptation.",3,"BEST PICTURE OSCAR, 193O.",1036972800,"11 11, 2002",2002,1061,"['sprawling', 'Western', 'family', 'saga', 'place', 'Oklahoma', 'period', '1889', '1929', 'dates', 'badly', 'was', 'big', 'early', 'talkie', 'viewers', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'harsh', 'film', 'opening', 'scenes', 'depict', 'Oklahoma', 'Land', 'Rush', 'positively', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'thousands', 'extras', 'rush', 'pell-mell', 'foot', 'horseback', 'wagon', 'mindless', 'dash', 'outwit', 'other', 'order', 'gain', 'free', 'land', 'Much', 'movie', 'considerable', 'talents', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'who', 'innocent', 'child-woman', 'grand', 'old', 'lady', 'span', '4O', 'years', 'Believe', 'not', 'film', 'was', 'considered', 'be', 'cinema', 'finest', 'Western', 'likes', 'RED', 'RIVER', 'HIGH', 'NOON', 'SHANE', 'made', 'marks', 'film', 'received', 'rave', 'reviews', 'THE', 'BEST', 'YEARS', 'OUR', 'LIVES', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'RKO', 'films', 'won', 'AA', 'Best', 'Picture', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Howard', 'Estabrook', 'based', 'source', 'novel', 'Edna', 'Ferber', 'film', 'cost', 'RKO', '1.5', 'million', 'dollars', 'film', 'also', 'won', 'Oscars', 'Best', 'Set', 'Decoration', 'Best', 'Adoptation']",Cimarron VHS

Wesley Ruggles' clumsy production of Edna Ferber's ""Cimarron"" survives only as a curio. The western saga opens with a rehash of the Oklahoma land-rush sequence from William S. Hart's 1925 classic ""Tumbleweeds"" and goes downhill fast. Richard Dix's cartoonish portrayal belongs in the School of Bad Acting, but Irene Dunne makes the most of her first starring role. In retrospect, ""Cimarron"" might have worked better as a silent film.",2,A Creaky Western Saga,1202428800,"02 8, 2008",2008,510,"['hard', 'believe', '1931', 'relic', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Wesley', 'Ruggles', 'clumsy', 'production', 'Edna', 'Ferber', 'Cimarron', 'only', 'curio', 'western', 'saga', 'rehash', 'Oklahoma', 'land-rush', 'sequence', 'William', 'S.', 'Hart', '1925', 'classic', 'Tumbleweeds', 'downhill', 'fast', 'Richard', 'Dix', 'cartoonish', 'portrayal', 'belongs', 'School', 'Bad', 'Acting', 'Irene', 'Dunne', 'most', 'first', 'starring', 'role', 'retrospect', 'Cimarron', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'silent', 'film']",Cimarron VHS
