516829,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B0000372I2,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[1, 1]","David Mamet's ""Winslow Boy"" is a break from his usual conventions. Instead of exploring contemporary American society,Mamet goes back in time to bring Terence Rattigan's play to life. Set in pre-WWI England, Mamet captures a society in transition. Catherine Winslow (Rebecca Pidgeon,Mamet's wife) is a suffragette. War on the Continent looms on the horizon. Set in 1908,the Russian Revolution is only a few years away. Beneath the calm,cool exterior,British society is roiling.The plot is deceptively simple- Ronnie Winslow (Guy Edwards),a young cadet, has stolen a postage stamp. It sounds like a surefire yawner. A Conservative, Sir Robert Morton (the talented&underrated; Jeremy Northam),takes up the case because he's smitten with Rebecca.Robert&Rebecca;'s romance is superbly done. While they don't end up making passionate love upon a love seat, their dialogue sizzles. They have chemistry,despite their ideological differences. It's subtle.  Robert's love inspires him to give an eloquent speech in defense of Ronnie,a discourse on Justice and Right. There are open-ended questions for the viewer: was Ronnie guilty? Was he kicked out because he wasn't part of the elite class? Do Robert and Rebecca end up together?""The Winslow Boy"" is Mamet's Merchant&Ivory; masterpiece. He's as capable of depicting uptight Edwardian Brits as he is unscrupulous American scam artists. This movie has gotten short shrift. It's a beautiful movie. It echoes the words of Ludwig Wittgenstein,an Austrian philosopher who also lived during that era,""Whereof one cannot speak,thereof one must be silent.""",5,Mamet's Merchant&Ivory,1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,1591,"['David', 'Mamet', 'Winslow', 'Boy', 'break', 'usual', 'conventions', 'Instead', 'exploring', 'contemporary', 'American', 'society', 'Mamet', 'back', 'time', 'bring', 'Terence', 'Rattigan', 'play', 'life', 'Set', 'pre-WWI', 'England', 'Mamet', 'society', 'transition', 'Catherine', 'Winslow', 'Rebecca', 'Pidgeon', 'Mamet', 'wife', 'suffragette', 'War', 'Continent', 'horizon', 'Set', '1908', 'Russian', 'Revolution', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'away', 'calm', 'cool', 'exterior', 'British', 'society', 'roiling.The', 'plot', 'deceptively', 'simple-', 'Ronnie', 'Winslow', 'Guy', 'Edwards', 'young', 'cadet', 'stolen', 'postage', 'stamp', 'surefire', 'yawner', 'Conservative', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'Morton', 'talented', 'underrated', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'up', 'case', 'smitten', 'Rebecca.Robert', 'Rebecca', 'romance', 'superbly', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'making', 'passionate', 'love', 'love', 'seat', 'dialogue', 'sizzles', 'have', 'chemistry', 'ideological', 'differences', 'subtle', 'Robert', 'love', 'give', 'eloquent', 'speech', 'defense', 'Ronnie', 'discourse', 'Justice', 'Right', 'are', 'open-ended', 'questions', 'viewer', 'was', 'Ronnie', 'guilty', 'Was', 'kicked', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'part', 'elite', 'class', 'Do', 'Robert', 'Rebecca', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'Winslow', 'Boy', 'Mamet', 'Merchant', 'Ivory', 'masterpiece', 'capable', 'depicting', 'uptight', 'Edwardian', 'Brits', 'unscrupulous', 'American', 'scam', 'artists', 'movie', 'gotten', 'short', 'shrift', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'words', 'Ludwig', 'Wittgenstein', 'Austrian', 'philosopher', 'who', 'also', 'lived', 'era', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'thereof', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'silent']",The Winslow Boy VHS

It should be honored and protected.The same is true of reputation. We live in a day and age where a person's character can be destroyed almost instantaneously in the media with little thought as to the consequences. This movie shows the value of taking an approach other than this. It shows that there are values and principles that are worth fighting for, and maybe risking everything for. This takes its cue from a principle found in the British Parliament whereby a petition against the ""Crown"" could be heard by the courts, endorsed with the words ""fiat justitia,"" normally translated as ""Let right be done.""""Right is done"" very well in this. In challenging the government, fighting for the youngest son believed unjustly accused and expelled from a military academy, the family and its members set their priorities to do the right thing, above so many of the other concerns that were prevalent: status, marriage arrangements, money and time. They obtained the country's most well-known attorney. They succeeded!One of the final lines, in a very moving scene with the boy's sister questioning the attorney after winning the case, was his response (and obviously what motivated him throughout the proceedings): ""Easy to do justice, very hard to do right.""

That's where my eye feels impelled to travel!  He plays the English barrister who represents the boy who is let go from  his school for allegedly stealing.  He strikes you at the start of the  movie as a great barrister but also an unbending man, cold as ice and as  handsome as a chiseled ice sculpture.  The young woman, the boy's sister,  is seemingly the barrister's opposite on everything. As the family's  resources are drained while the case drags on, it becomes apparent that the  reason Northam is such a great barrister is that there is tremendous  passion in  his inner convictions which lies under his outside edifice.  This has one of the best movie endings I've ever seen and the dialogue  between the barrister and the sister is absolutely perfect.

516835,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0000372I2,C. O. DeRiemer,"[24, 24]","This is a first-class David Mamet film of indirection, understatement and cool emotion. A young cadet at the Royal Naval Academy has been expelled for stealing a five-shilling postal order from another cadet. He swears to his father that he didn't do it and his father believes him. At that point Arthur Winslow (Nigel Hawthorne) becomes determined to prove his son innocent. He is rebuffed by the Admiralty because, as part of the Queen's government, the Admiralty can do no wrong and cannot be sued. He engages a famous solicitor, Sir Robert Morton (Jeremy Northam), who agrees to take the brief. Morton eventually succeeds in bringing the case before the House of Commons on a petition of right, where even the lowest of the Queen's subjects can have the opportunity ""to have right be done."" All this takes years. The Winslow family suffers ridicule and financial distress. Arthur Winslow's daughter, Catherine (Rebecca Pidgeon), a prickly and intelligent suffragette, sees her opportunity for an advantageous marriage evaporate. His son is forced to leave Oxford and take a banking job. His wife sees so much of the security of the home vanish in the costs of the case. The case, based on a true happening, finally is won.Mamet's screenplay is based on the Forties play by Terence Rattigan. It's a solid piece of work that keeps the story moving and concentrates on the characters. The interplay among the characters is excellent, especially between Catherine Winslow and Sir Robert Morton. The dialogue may be on the surface exquisitely courteous, but underneath runs unexpected currents that are a lot of fun to witness. Northam's Morton is smart, secure, successful and not at all sympathetic to suffragettes. But it gradually becomes clear he rather likes intelligent women and that the end of the case may not be the last Catherine Winslow sees of him:Sir Robert Morton: You still pursue your feminist activities?Catherine Winslow: Oh yes.Sir Robert: Pity. It's a lost cause.Catherine: Oh, do you really think so, Sir Robert? How little you know about women. Good-bye. I doubt that we shall meet again.Sir Robert: Do you really think so, Miss Winslow? How little you know about men.It has always seemed strange to me that those who like Mamet almost never mention this movie, yet it appears to me that this is one of his most solidly directed and written films. It may be that, like Scorsese's Age of Innocence, it just doesn't fit into preconceived notions of what the director's films should be like.

516837,A2TL9FBMOC7AVK,B0000372I2,Curtis Crawford,"[11, 21]","David Mamet's version of ""The Winslow Boy"" quite fails to understand Terence Rattigan's play, from which the film is derived.  The film is glued to a one-dimensional stereotype of pre-World War I English behavior, decorous and emotionally suppressed, which defeats the drama at every turn.The play, on the contrary, is not a period piece.  It portrays the agony, humiliation, disbelief, indifference, anger, confusion, determination, persistence, idealism, sacrifice, protective love, cynicism, and fear with which a boy's nearest and dearest react to his expulsion from naval cadet school, and the crusade to vindicate him.  Their language may be more refined and their emotional expression more controlled than often occurs, but within these limits the range and conflict are substantial.By combining his stereotype with extensive deletions, Mamet cuts off his characters at the knees, if not higher.  The father's determination and persistence remain, but most of his tendency to dominate and humiliate is gone.  The sister's intelligence, loyalty and tact are there, but not the poignant depth of her love and vulnerability.  We see the mother's protective love, but not the formidable passion of her attack against the crusade.The original play feeds the intellect by raising questions about the boy's innocence, and about the worth of the crusade in his behalf; contrary opinions are not merely stated, but supported with cogent reasons.  It feeds the soul by raising the banner of doing Right, and facing the substantial sacrifices along the way.  It feeds the heart by showing the deep and vulnerable love of a father for his son, of a mother for her family, of a daughter for her fiance, of a family friend for the daughter.  All this food is on short ration in Mamet's remake.Rattigan has a fine dramatic sense, which Mamet often spoils.  Watch, for example, what should be the most striking scene of the story, a cross-examination of the Winslow boy in the family parlor. England's best trial lawyer is deciding whether to take the case.  In the original, the questioning starts quietly but builds to an aggressive harshness that has the boy muddled and crying, and the family angry and alarmed.  Whereupon the lawyer, to everyone's surprise, accepts the case, calling the boy ""plainly innocent.""  Mamet doesn't cut the text in this scene, but he does cut way back on the lawyer's aggressiveness and the boy's distress.  The dramatic excitement of the original, based on powerful emotional reversals, is mostly lost in the remake.Within the limits of the Mamet stereotype, Nigel Hawthorne as the father and Jeremy Northam as the lawyer are interesting and pleasant to watch.

The stereotypical staidness of the British upper-class makes itself felt, even in the elegant well-orchestrated theme music.Based on the real-life 1908 case of young George Archer-Shee, the story is about the 13-year old son of a retired banker (Nigel Hawthorne)named Ronnie(a fair and staid looking Guy Edwards, whose sunny complexion stands out against his predominantly brunette family)is expelled from the Royal Naval College after being wrongfully accused of theft and forgery.In Edwardian Britain, it was assumed the that the Crown was always right and those punished were always justly punished.The publicity surrounding the case has scared off potential suitors for the Winslow's daughter, Catherine(an assertive Rebecca Pidgeon), a suffragette, and takes its toll on Arthur Winslow's  wife, Grace(Gemma Jones)and other son, Dickie(Matthew Pidgeon)as well.The family's solicitor, Desmond Curry (Colin Stanton) acquires an appointment for young Ronnie to be interviewed by one of England's best barristers, Sir Robert Morton.Our first glimpse of Jeremy Northam's Sir Robert Morton is as he in his office readying himself to attend an important dinner. While waiting for the rest of her family to arrive, Catherine , who has often observed Morton from up in the galleries of Parliament previously, speaks with him. The cut away camera shots lend a certain drama to this scene, as do Northam's imposing 6""2"" frame, the slight tilt of his head,which places emphasis on his broad shoulders, and sloe-eyed sidelong glances. The subtleties of the actor and the cinematography are a thing of poetry and play off very well on each other.The interview convinces Sir Robert of the lad's innocence, and he decides to take the case. It is decided that a petition of right against the crown will be used to bring the case to court.The attraction between Catherine and Sir Robert grows, captured in subtle ways at first, in an exchanged glance between Catherine and Robert as she looks through the wire barrier of the galleries while he is on the Parliament floor, and in Robert's signs of being impressed by Catherine's intelligence during her inquiries about issues pertaining to the case, which by now, has so enthralled Britain to the point where the family must find ways around reporters crowding around their home at all hours.At one point, Mr. Winslow considers withdrawing the case, as someone close to the family who is in the Admiralty plans to levy grave consequences. But Sir Robert perseveres after convincing Mr. Winslow to delay the withdrawal of the case, and eventually, through the Winslow's faithful maid, Violet (Sarah Flind), we learn of the case's satisfactory outcome.Sir Robert presents the family will the statement at their home, and is once more quizzed by Catherine regarding its details. Through all the staidness and reserve, Morton's other motives for winning the case become visible, especially during a slight stammer in response to a statement by Catherine regarding a particular sacrifice he had made for it. The banter between the two has often been highly provocative, but never more so than at this point.All I could think while watching that scene is,"" You've got him, Catherine!""Giving it the look and feel of an episode of ""Masterpiece Theatre"", David Mamet has skillfully directed a variegated love story--a love of justice, a love of right, a love of a father for his son, a love of honor, and the potential love story between a man and a woman.",5,A Case of Honor...And Potential Romance,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,3599,"['Terrence', 'Rattigan', '1946', 'play', 'onscreen', 'incarnation', 'study', 'family', 'honor', 'stake', 'stereotypical', 'staidness', 'British', 'upper-class', 'felt', 'even', 'elegant', 'well-orchestrated', 'theme', 'music.Based', 'real-life', '1908', 'case', 'young', 'George', 'Archer-Shee', 'story', '13-year', 'old', 'son', 'retired', 'banker', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'named', 'Ronnie', 'fair', 'staid', 'looking', 'Guy', 'Edwards', 'sunny', 'complexion', 'out', 'predominantly', 'brunette', 'family', 'expelled', 'Royal', 'Naval', 'College', 'being', 'wrongfully', 'accused', 'theft', 'forgery.In', 'Edwardian', 'Britain', 'was', 'assumed', 'Crown', 'was', 'always', 'right', 'punished', 'were', 'always', 'justly', 'punished.The', 'publicity', 'surrounding', 'case', 'scared', 'off', 'potential', 'suitors', 'Winslow', 'daughter', 'Catherine', 'assertive', 'Rebecca', 'Pidgeon', 'suffragette', 'toll', 'Arthur', 'Winslow', 'wife', 'Grace', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'other', 'son', 'Dickie', 'Matthew', 'Pidgeon', 'well.The', 'family', 'solicitor', 'Desmond', 'Curry', 'Colin', 'Stanton', 'appointment', 'young', 'Ronnie', 'be', 'interviewed', 'one', 'England', 'best', 'barristers', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'Morton.Our', 'first', 'glimpse', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'Morton', 'office', 'readying', 'attend', 'important', 'dinner', 'waiting', 'rest', 'family', 'arrive', 'Catherine', 'who', 'often', 'observed', 'Morton', 'galleries', 'Parliament', 'previously', 'speaks', 'cut', 'away', 'camera', 'shots', 'lend', 'certain', 'drama', 'scene', 'do', 'Northam', 'imposing', '6', '2', 'frame', 'slight', 'tilt', 'head', 'emphasis', 'broad', 'shoulders', 'sloe-eyed', 'sidelong', 'glances', 'subtleties', 'actor', 'cinematography', 'are', 'thing', 'poetry', 'play', 'off', 'very', 'well', 'other.The', 'interview', 'convinces', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'lad', 'innocence', 'take', 'case', 'decided', 'petition', 'right', 'crown', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'bring', 'case', 'court.The', 'attraction', 'Catherine', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'captured', 'subtle', 'ways', 'first', 'exchanged', 'glance', 'Catherine', 'Robert', 'wire', 'barrier', 'galleries', 'Parliament', 'floor', 'Robert', 'signs', 'being', 'impressed', 'Catherine', 'intelligence', 'inquiries', 'issues', 'pertaining', 'case', 'now', 'so', 'enthralled', 'Britain', 'point', 'where', 'family', 'must', 'find', 'ways', 'reporters', 'crowding', 'home', 'hours.At', 'one', 'point', 'Mr.', 'Winslow', 'withdrawing', 'case', 'someone', 'close', 'family', 'who', 'Admiralty', 'levy', 'grave', 'consequences', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'perseveres', 'convincing', 'Mr.', 'Winslow', 'delay', 'withdrawal', 'case', 'eventually', 'Winslow', 'faithful', 'maid', 'Violet', 'Sarah', 'Flind', 'learn', 'case', 'satisfactory', 'outcome.Sir', 'Robert', 'family', 'will', 'statement', 'home', 'once', 'more', 'quizzed', 'Catherine', 'regarding', 'details', 'staidness', 'reserve', 'Morton', 'other', 'motives', 'winning', 'case', 'become', 'visible', 'especially', 'slight', 'stammer', 'response', 'statement', 'Catherine', 'regarding', 'particular', 'sacrifice', 'had', 'made', 'banter', 'two', 'often', 'been', 'highly', 'provocative', 'never', 'more', 'so', 'point.All', 'could', 'think', 'watching', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Catherine', 'Giving', 'look', 'feel', 'episode', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'David', 'Mamet', 'skillfully', 'directed', 'variegated', 'love', 'story', 'love', 'justice', 'love', 'right', 'love', 'father', 'son', 'love', 'honor', 'potential', 'love', 'story', 'man', 'woman']",The Winslow Boy VHS
516839,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,B0000372I2,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[21, 21]","I attended a play a while back with my Aunt Marge (age 85), and her friends Marie (age 87) and Susie (age 85).  While we were waiting for the curtain to rise, I told them I had just seen a great movie entitled  &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; directed by David Mamet. Marie, a retired high  school teacher (French) and her sister Susie (a retired Broadway director  and producer) both expresssed surprise.Marie told me she had directed  the play &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; in high school in the late 1920's --  making the stage play a bit older than the screen play of 1946. Susie  played the role of Ms. Winslow in Marie's play.This is a great movie.  The actors include Gemma Jones (Sense and Sensibility), Nigel Hawthorne  (The Madness of King George), and Jeremy Northam (Emma). Not only did Mamet  direct the movie and develop the screen play, Gemma Jones was involved in  the production design.I love the theater, and viewing this movie gave  me the sense I was watching live theater. In fact, the camera work is so  good, it was better than live theater as I felt present on the stage. It  was as if my eye had detached from my body and could float  independently--sometimes at bustle level as an actor walked across the  floor--or sometimes at eye level, as when young Winslow hesitates in the  rain before entering the house to tell his family of his disgrace.The  story involves a fight for justice. A young  boy is expelled from school  for cheating. The family might have quietly enrolled him in another school  and tried to forget the business, but the boy's father Arthur Winslow  (Hawthorne) believes his son is innocent and wants him exonerated.  Over  the objections of his wife (Jones) and with the help of his daughter  (Rebecca Pigeon), he decides to fight the charges. The family hires the  very talented Sir Robert Morton (Northam) to take their case. In the end  justice triumps.The most fascinating aspect of this film is the  increible sexual tension that mounts between Sir  Robert and Ms Winslow as  the case proceeds. They are exact opposites. Ms Winslow is a feminist and  engages in all sorts of daring things including smoking cigarettes and  writing and distributing literature on behalf of the Women's Movement.  Sir  Robert is a conservative lord, in line for Prime Minister--if he plays his  cards right. He looks askance on her feminist activities, but he cannot  overcome his fascination with and attraction to Ms. Winslow. The glances,  the looks, the indrawn breaths, and quips that convey feelings are  fabulous.Time and again, Ms Winslow tells Sir Robert that he simply  does not understand women.  He makes  comments designed to preserve his  aloofness, but eventually, Sir Robert's feelings get the better of him. His  last impassioned speech on the floor of the House of Lords--which probably  sinks his aspirations for PM--is on behalf of the Winslow boy, but it is  purely for Ms. Winslow's benefit.At the end, standing by the back  garden gate, Ms. Winslow thanks Sir Robert for all he has done, and bids  him goodbye. He takes her hand, bows, and says, &quot;If you believe that  Ms. Winslow, you simply don't understand men.&quot;",5,Edwardian bodice buster...,960422400,"06 8, 2000",2000,3176,"['attended', 'play', 'while', 'back', 'Aunt', 'Marge', 'age', '85', 'friends', 'Marie', 'age', '87', 'Susie', 'age', '85', 'were', 'waiting', 'curtain', 'rise', 'told', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'great', 'movie', 'entitled', 'quot', 'Winslow', 'Boy', 'quot', 'directed', 'David', 'Mamet', 'Marie', 'retired', 'high', 'school', 'teacher', 'French', 'sister', 'Susie', 'retired', 'Broadway', 'director', 'producer', 'expresssed', 'surprise.Marie', 'told', 'had', 'directed', 'play', 'quot', 'Winslow', 'Boy', 'quot', 'high', 'school', 'late', '1920', 'making', 'stage', 'play', 'bit', 'older', 'screen', 'play', '1946', 'Susie', 'played', 'role', 'Ms.', 'Winslow', 'Marie', 'play.This', 'great', 'movie', 'actors', 'include', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'Madness', 'King', 'George', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Emma', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Mamet', 'direct', 'movie', 'develop', 'screen', 'play', 'Gemma', 'Jones', 'was', 'involved', 'production', 'design.I', 'theater', 'viewing', 'movie', 'gave', 'sense', 'was', 'watching', 'live', 'theater', 'fact', 'camera', 'work', 'so', 'good', 'was', 'better', 'live', 'theater', 'felt', 'present', 'stage', 'was', 'eye', 'had', 'detached', 'body', 'could', 'float', 'independently', 'sometimes', 'bustle', 'level', 'actor', 'walked', 'floor', 'sometimes', 'eye', 'level', 'when', 'young', 'Winslow', 'hesitates', 'rain', 'entering', 'house', 'tell', 'family', 'disgrace.The', 'story', 'fight', 'justice', 'young', 'boy', 'expelled', 'school', 'cheating', 'family', 'might', 'have', 'quietly', 'enrolled', 'school', 'tried', 'forget', 'business', 'boy', 'father', 'Arthur', 'Winslow', 'Hawthorne', 'son', 'innocent', 'exonerated', 'objections', 'wife', 'Jones', 'help', 'daughter', 'Rebecca', 'Pigeon', 'fight', 'charges', 'family', 'very', 'talented', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'Morton', 'Northam', 'take', 'case', 'end', 'justice', 'most', 'fascinating', 'aspect', 'film', 'increible', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'Ms', 'Winslow', 'case', 'proceeds', 'are', 'exact', 'opposites', 'Ms', 'Winslow', 'feminist', 'engages', 'sorts', 'daring', 'things', 'including', 'smoking', 'cigarettes', 'writing', 'distributing', 'literature', 'behalf', 'Women', 'Movement', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'conservative', 'lord', 'line', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'cards', 'right', 'askance', 'feminist', 'activities', 'can', 'not', 'overcome', 'fascination', 'attraction', 'Ms.', 'Winslow', 'glances', 'looks', 'indrawn', 'breaths', 'convey', 'feelings', 'are', 'fabulous.Time', 'again', 'Ms', 'Winslow', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'simply', 'not', 'understand', 'women', 'comments', 'designed', 'preserve', 'aloofness', 'eventually', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'feelings', 'get', 'better', 'last', 'impassioned', 'speech', 'floor', 'House', 'Lords', 'probably', 'aspirations', 'PM', 'behalf', 'Winslow', 'boy', 'purely', 'Ms.', 'Winslow', 'benefit.At', 'end', 'standing', 'back', 'garden', 'gate', 'Ms.', 'Winslow', 'thanks', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'done', 'bids', 'goodbye', 'hand', 'bows', 'quot', 'believe', 'Ms.', 'Winslow', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'men.', 'quot']",The Winslow Boy VHS

516841,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0000372I2,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 2]","True event: a couple of years before the outbreak of WWI, a 13-year-old boy at the Royal Naval College was accused of stealing a postal money order from his closest friend and forging his friend's signature to cash it. The boy, Ronald Winslow, was kicked out, sent home and never seemed to know why--until he was informed, very late, about the guilty finding against him.His father--a rather elderly retired banker--believed the boy's story at once, and set out to protest the charge. Ultimately, Mr. Winslow would get his case heard in court. Few people here could comprehend that Mr. Winslow was suing the Admiralty; in essence he was suing the Crown. The reputation even of a teenager was as precious as the gravity of bringing suit against the King. Their first problem was receiving a sort of grace, the Crown allowing the case to be brought into court as if by special favor.I don't mind divulging that the case ""Winslow versus Rex"" (""Rex"" meaning of course the king) was won by Winslow resoundingly. David Mamet's THE WINSLOW BOY, originally an old Terence Rattigan play based on the true events, is one of those quiet British period pieces that I'm addicted to seeing over and over--they get into one's bloodstream directly. Only one problem........There is something about Mamet that has always eluded me; in the end, it's probably nothing more than his clear deficiencies as a director. They are not serious or terrible, but they can be annoying. Especially when he is handling Rattigan's handiwork. Even with Rattigan on board the project.THE WINSLOW BOY is a perfect example of the method Mamet employs to lead viewers into something of a conundrum: was this a poorly adapted, badly directed film? Did we all miss something? Do we simply not understand English society of that era?Old Mr. Winslow (Nigel Hawthorne, outstanding as usual) seems to be high on laudanum all the time and suffused with an unearthly calm. Other than the fantastic Jeremy Northam as Sir Robert Morton the rest of the cast is as stiff as cardboard and really not far from it in every respect. I find that 'cardboard state' is the result of bad direction and even worse dialogue. Some of it is reminiscent of one of those unintelligible books of E.M. Forster, and gets irritating after a few words have been spoken.Tough to swallow that this is actually based on Terence Rattigan's work, and he wrote this film's screenplay, too. Some folks cite it as having been directed by Rattigan...no such luck. Perhaps I just did not sink as deeply into Rattigan this time round; not as deeply as Mamet, who has a flair for the boring but can't give it any flair. The Great Asquith directed the original film from 1948--one of Rattigan's triumphs--and the UK did a 1958 television version, again involving Rattigan in some way. Generally, I LOVE Rattigan, but he was so much better off being directed by Asquith in gems such as WAY TO THE STARS (see my review).Also I feel the story is told in a terribly hodge-podge manner; it is not told through the boy's eyes, not through the father's, apparently through nobody's eyes. The attitude of the English public (support for the boy's rights) is clear enough, though Mamet almost seems to be attempting to hide it. Even the charm of Ronnie Winslow (a youthful, glowing Guy Edwards) does nothing to help the viewer.This is a bit of a hapless film; I'd think Ang Lee could have done it much better justice. He is today's answer to Asquith. Still, I find it somewhat quietly humorous, deftly executed as dinner theater drama, and quieting for the nerves. More than can be said for most offerings. This is a movie really not to be missed in spite of all my groaning. It represents a period in British filmmaking that we may never enjoy again.One last note: this is NOT a courtroom drama, though it is about a major court case, and thank the cinema gods it wasn't made that way. I commend Mamet for approaching it from a 'sideways' perspective as he did.",4,"""Easy to do justice; hard to do right.""",1278115200,"07 3, 2010",2010,3972,"['True', 'event', 'couple', 'years', 'outbreak', 'WWI', '13-year-old', 'boy', 'Royal', 'Naval', 'College', 'was', 'accused', 'stealing', 'postal', 'money', 'order', 'closest', 'friend', 'forging', 'friend', 'signature', 'cash', 'boy', 'Ronald', 'Winslow', 'was', 'kicked', 'out', 'sent', 'home', 'never', 'seemed', 'know', 'why', 'was', 'informed', 'very', 'late', 'guilty', 'finding', 'him.His', 'father', 'rather', 'elderly', 'retired', 'banker', 'believed', 'boy', 'story', 'once', 'set', 'out', 'protest', 'charge', 'Ultimately', 'Mr.', 'Winslow', 'would', 'get', 'case', 'heard', 'court', 'Few', 'people', 'here', 'could', 'comprehend', 'Mr.', 'Winslow', 'was', 'suing', 'Admiralty', 'essence', 'was', 'suing', 'Crown', 'reputation', 'even', 'teenager', 'was', 'as', 'precious', 'gravity', 'bringing', 'suit', 'King', 'first', 'problem', 'was', 'receiving', 'sort', 'grace', 'Crown', 'allowing', 'case', 'be', 'brought', 'court', 'special', 'favor.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'divulging', 'case', 'Winslow', 'versus', 'Rex', 'Rex', 'meaning', 'course', 'king', 'was', 'won', 'Winslow', 'resoundingly', 'David', 'Mamet', 'THE', 'WINSLOW', 'BOY', 'originally', 'old', 'Terence', 'Rattigan', 'play', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'one', 'quiet', 'British', 'period', 'pieces', ""'m"", 'addicted', 'seeing', 'over', 'over', 'get', 'one', 'bloodstream', 'directly', 'Only', 'one', 'problem', 'something', 'Mamet', 'always', 'eluded', 'end', 'probably', 'nothing', 'more', 'clear', 'deficiencies', 'director', 'are', 'not', 'serious', 'terrible', 'can', 'be', 'annoying', 'Especially', 'when', 'handling', 'Rattigan', 'handiwork', 'Even', 'Rattigan', 'board', 'project.THE', 'WINSLOW', 'BOY', 'perfect', 'example', 'method', 'Mamet', 'lead', 'viewers', 'something', 'conundrum', 'was', 'poorly', 'adapted', 'badly', 'directed', 'film', 'Did', 'miss', 'something', 'Do', 'simply', 'not', 'understand', 'English', 'society', 'era', 'Old', 'Mr.', 'Winslow', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'outstanding', 'usual', 'be', 'high', 'laudanum', 'time', 'suffused', 'unearthly', 'calm', 'Other', 'fantastic', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'Morton', 'rest', 'cast', 'as', 'stiff', 'cardboard', 'really', 'not', 'far', 'respect', 'find', ""'cardboard"", 'state', 'result', 'bad', 'direction', 'even', 'worse', 'dialogue', 'reminiscent', 'one', 'unintelligible', 'books', 'E.M.', 'Forster', 'irritating', 'few', 'words', 'have', 'been', 'spoken.Tough', 'swallow', 'actually', 'based', 'Terence', 'Rattigan', 'work', 'wrote', 'film', 'screenplay', 'too', 'folks', 'cite', 'having', 'been', 'directed', 'Rattigan', 'such', 'luck', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'sink', 'deeply', 'Rattigan', 'time', 'round', 'not', 'as', 'deeply', 'Mamet', 'who', 'flair', 'boring', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'flair', 'Great', 'Asquith', 'directed', 'original', 'film', '1948', 'one', 'Rattigan', 'triumphs', 'UK', 'did', '1958', 'television', 'version', 'again', 'involving', 'Rattigan', 'way', 'Generally', 'LOVE', 'Rattigan', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'being', 'directed', 'Asquith', 'gems', 'such', 'WAY', 'TO', 'THE', 'STARS', 'see', 'review', '.Also', 'feel', 'story', 'told', 'terribly', 'hodge-podge', 'manner', 'not', 'told', 'boy', 'eyes', 'not', 'father', 'apparently', 'nobody', 'eyes', 'attitude', 'English', 'public', 'support', 'boy', 'rights', 'clear', 'enough', 'Mamet', 'almost', 'be', 'attempting', 'hide', 'Even', 'charm', 'Ronnie', 'Winslow', 'youthful', 'glowing', 'Guy', 'Edwards', 'nothing', 'help', 'viewer.This', 'bit', 'hapless', 'film', ""'d"", 'think', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'justice', 'today', 'answer', 'Asquith', 'Still', 'find', 'somewhat', 'quietly', 'humorous', 'deftly', 'executed', 'dinner', 'theater', 'drama', 'quieting', 'nerves', 'More', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'most', 'offerings', 'movie', 'really', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'spite', 'groaning', 'period', 'British', 'filmmaking', 'may', 'never', 'enjoy', 'again.One', 'last', 'note', 'NOT', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'major', 'court', 'case', 'thank', 'cinema', 'gods', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'way', 'commend', 'Mamet', 'approaching', ""'sideways"", 'perspective', 'did']",The Winslow Boy VHS

It was generally an engaging story, although it bogged down in  places when it became overly introspective. Too much time was spent on  scenes devoted solely to the cost/benefit of the fight. Is it worth it?  Yes. But is it really worth it? Yes. There were at least four such scenes  when one would have sufficed. This is a minor flaw in an otherwise good  script. This story was about a legal fight but oddly had no scenes in  court. It would have benefited by a stirring closing argument by Sir  Robert. However, the suspense of how the family received the news of the  verdict was excellent.The direction in this film is superb. The sets  and costumes were wonderfully matched to the period. The photography was  rich and full of complimentary colors. Mamet was meticulous in subtle  details, such as the scene where a hanging piece, as evidenced by its  outline, was obviously missing from the wall due to the costly fight for  the boy's honor. Mamet uses the camera well to create impact with extreme  close ups, like the close up of the wax seal on the letter from the school  and another of a passage from the Bible.He directs the actors adeptly  with just the right mix of restrained passion and proper English demeanor  typical of early 20th century England. The dialogue was delivered crisply  with rapid fire exchanges, reminiscent of films made in the 40's and 50's,  a style that has been all but lost in contemporary films. The portrayal of  the subtle romantic tension between natural antagonists Sir Robert, the  staunch conservative and Catherine Winslow, the crusading liberal, was  marvelous.The acting was fabulous. Jeremy Northam (Sir Robert Morton)  had an excellent 1999 with this role and his role of Sir Robert Chiltern in  &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;. He seems to be inspired by roles where his  name is Sir Robert.Rebecca Pidgeon reunites with Mamet again after  &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot; and gives a strong performance of the  phlegmatic liberal woman's suffragette who is caught in the maelstrom of  her brother's fight. Her's was a difficult role because her character was a  highly passionate crusader compelled to restraint due to the constraints of  the etiquette of the times. She did a good job of portraying a sardonic  disdain for such phoniness delivering simple courtesies with obvious  contempt. Yet, she was often a little too deadpan about her own  emotions.Nigel Hawthorne gave a fine performance as the patriarch. He  gave a good rendition of a proud and powerful man in decline as age, his  infirmities and the legal fight took their toll on him.Newcomer Guy  Edwards was excellent as Ronnie Winslow. He was the picture of a proper  British boy, but when confronted with the postal order, he would stare you  right in the eyes, plant his heels and convince you he didn't do it and  that he was telling the truth.I gave this film a 9/10. It is yet another  terrific British project that is a must see for the intelligent and refined  viewer.",5,Wonderfully intelligent film,956102400,"04 19, 2000",2000,3514,"['quot', 'Winslow', 'Boy', 'quot', 'terrific', 'old', 'fashioned', 'drama', 'smartly', 'done', 'director', 'David', 'Mamet', 'story', 'was', 'compelling', 'account', 'honor', 'fight', 'what', 'right', 'matter', 'what', 'cost.Ronnie', 'Winslow', 'Guy', 'Edwards', 'expelled', 'Naval', 'College', 'allegedly', 'stealing', 'cashing', 'postal', 'order', 'five', 'shillings', 'resolute', 'denial', 'deed', 'father', 'Arthur', 'Winslow', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'everything', 'family', 'take', 'up', 'legal', 'battle', 'clear', 'son', 'name', 'was', 'generally', 'engaging', 'story', 'bogged', 'down', 'places', 'when', 'became', 'overly', 'introspective', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'scenes', 'devoted', 'solely', 'cost/benefit', 'fight', 'Yes', 'really', 'Yes', 'were', 'least', 'four', 'such', 'scenes', 'when', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed', 'minor', 'flaw', 'otherwise', 'good', 'script', 'story', 'was', 'legal', 'fight', 'oddly', 'had', 'scenes', 'court', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'stirring', 'closing', 'argument', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'However', 'suspense', 'how', 'family', 'received', 'news', 'verdict', 'was', 'excellent.The', 'direction', 'film', 'superb', 'sets', 'costumes', 'were', 'wonderfully', 'matched', 'period', 'photography', 'was', 'rich', 'full', 'complimentary', 'colors', 'Mamet', 'was', 'meticulous', 'subtle', 'details', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'hanging', 'piece', 'evidenced', 'outline', 'was', 'obviously', 'missing', 'wall', 'due', 'costly', 'fight', 'boy', 'honor', 'Mamet', 'camera', 'well', 'create', 'impact', 'extreme', 'close', 'ups', 'close', 'wax', 'seal', 'letter', 'school', 'passage', 'Bible.He', 'actors', 'adeptly', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'restrained', 'passion', 'proper', 'English', 'demeanor', 'typical', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'England', 'dialogue', 'was', 'delivered', 'crisply', 'rapid', 'fire', 'exchanges', 'reminiscent', 'films', 'made', '40', '50', ""'s"", 'style', 'been', 'lost', 'contemporary', 'films', 'portrayal', 'subtle', 'romantic', 'tension', 'natural', 'antagonists', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'staunch', 'conservative', 'Catherine', 'Winslow', 'crusading', 'liberal', 'was', 'marvelous.The', 'acting', 'was', 'fabulous', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'Morton', 'had', 'excellent', '1999', 'role', 'role', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'Chiltern', 'quot', 'Ideal', 'Husband', 'quot', 'be', 'inspired', 'roles', 'where', 'name', 'Sir', 'Robert.Rebecca', 'Pidgeon', 'Mamet', 'again', 'quot', 'Spanish', 'Prisoner', 'quot', 'strong', 'performance', 'phlegmatic', 'liberal', 'woman', 'suffragette', 'who', 'caught', 'maelstrom', 'brother', 'fight', 'was', 'difficult', 'role', 'character', 'was', 'highly', 'passionate', 'crusader', 'compelled', 'restraint', 'due', 'constraints', 'etiquette', 'times', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'sardonic', 'disdain', 'such', 'phoniness', 'delivering', 'simple', 'courtesies', 'obvious', 'contempt', 'was', 'often', 'little', 'too', 'deadpan', 'own', 'emotions.Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'gave', 'fine', 'performance', 'patriarch', 'gave', 'good', 'rendition', 'proud', 'powerful', 'man', 'decline', 'age', 'infirmities', 'legal', 'fight', 'took', 'toll', 'him.Newcomer', 'Guy', 'Edwards', 'was', 'excellent', 'Ronnie', 'Winslow', 'was', 'picture', 'proper', 'British', 'boy', 'when', 'confronted', 'postal', 'order', 'would', 'stare', 'right', 'eyes', 'plant', 'heels', 'convince', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'was', 'telling', 'truth.I', 'gave', 'film', '9/10', 'yet', 'terrific', 'British', 'project', 'must', 'see', 'intelligent', 'refined', 'viewer']",The Winslow Boy VHS
516844,A2VE83MZF98ITY,B0000372I2,"FrKurt Messick ""FrKurt Messick""","[18, 19]","--Prologue--To quote Mel Brooks, 'it's good to be the king'. The King, in England, cannot be sued. It is a presumption in law that King, being the embodiment of civil authority, can do no wrong. Consequent to this, all parts of the King's establishment, household, etc. also carry this immunity by extension.So, when a 13 year old boy was accused of theft in Osbourne Naval College on the Isle of Wight, and summarily dismissed, the family had little recourse. And only one hope.The King can allow a suit to go forward, essentially by an act of grace, by proclaiming that despite the legal immunity and presumption of infallibility (and you thought only the Pope claimed infallibility!) that there is a just cause at stake. So, he can let the case be examined and tried, using the proclamation: 'Let Right Be Done!'--The Case--George Archer-Shee was the accused. Despite the suspicion of several cadets, Archer-Shee was the only one expelled. This was in 1908. His father, Martin Archer-Shee, a Liverpool banker, believed his son's insistence of innocence, and pursued the case through legal and political channels to the extent that his influence would permit.It became quite a celebrity cause, complete with all of the trinkets, hats, shirts, etc. that one more recently would ascribe to the antics surrounding the O.J. Simpson trial. People waited impatiently for the latest press reports, and the final verdict in favour of the boy sent the public into cheering.--The Play--This movie is based on a play by Terence Rattigan, which opened first in 1946. It was previously made into a film (in 1950), and has enjoyed periodic resurrection on the stage, most recently in 1994 as a West End production by Wyn Jones.Rattigan changed details, not least the names involved: he changed the sister and brother, both ardent Conservatives, into liberal and, in the case of the brother, less than diligent personages. He moved the date forward, and the age of the boy back, and dropped the religious aspect, to try to make this a tale more involved with justice against the Crown (representing any unfeeling, uncaring, faceless authority).David Mamet, best known for movies such as Glengary Glenross, The Spanish Prisoner, and Homicide, adapted the play. 'In adaptation, at first it would seem like the other fellow's doing all the work,' says Mamet. 'But when you get into it, you see it's not true. The previous work exists in its own right and for very good reasons, but you have to make changes to adapt it to the medium of the screen. But to the degree that this succeeds, it's because it's a great piece of dramaturgy on the part of Rattigan.' The play actually takes place completely within the confines of the Winslow drawing room.--The Film--Mamet of course did not confine the movie to the confines of one room. Also, he changed the dialogue around such that much of it occurs in a rat-a-tat-tat fashion much of the time. Mamet is not one for a great deal of action in a physical sense, but keeping track of the dialogue can be positively tiring.Sir Nigel Hawthorne, best known currently as the star of the title role in 'The Madness of King George', for which he was nominated for an Oscar. He brings his quintessentially British character and presence to this very English family. In the role of the lawyer (Sir Robert Morton), Jeremy Northam (perhaps most recently seen in 'An Ideal Husband') brings an insight into the cost of career and the distance created from an image of greatness, while maintaining the basic humanity of the character who cares for justice. Rebecca Pidgeon, who worked with Mamet earlier in 'The Spanish Prisoner' plays the pivotal role of the accused boy's sister, Catherine, who sacrifices her marriage to the cause (for the husband-to-be wants a less controversial life, er, wife). In this picture (and play) Catherine is a dedicated Suffragette (Rattigan finally got the real sister to accept his revision of her life -- remember, she was an ardent Conservative).The acting is superb, seems to be a bit slow at times but that is due more to the intentional style rather than any fault of acting. This is a cinematic style of presenting an essentially dialogue-based play that becomes a bit laboured. Much better in the theatre (either as a play or a film) than on home video, where the minor distractions of the home make it more difficult to concentrate. This film requires concentration.--Epilogue--In the end, the case is won. In the film, no discussion is made of the aftermath, for this is a single-pointed story - 'Let Right Be Done'. Of course, right can be defined in different terms. Despite being acquitted, the young Archer-Shee never got much benefit of this. He was killed shortly afterward serving in the military in 1914, near the beginning of World War I. His older brother (portrayed in the film as a slacker-student) in fact became a Conservative Member of Parliament, and pressed the case to win back for the family a compensation of 3000 (a princely sum in that time) plus court costs. However, the Admiralty never issued an apology and never rescinded the charges.Such a minor case. Such a major issue.A pity so few will ever see this film.

516845,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B0000372I2,F. S. L'hoir,"[7, 7]","It took me several years to get around to purchasing ""The Winslow Boy"". Although I was certain that I would like it--after all, Nigel Hawthorne was in it--I had no idea that I was in for an hour-and-a-half of such absorbing drama. In one of his last roles, Hawthorne brings a poignant combination of strength and tenderness to the role of the patriarch, whose determination to ""let right be done"" almost breaks apart the family that he is trying to preserve. His scenes with Gemma Jones--torn apart by her conflicting roles as loyal wife and loving mother--are especially moving. Because of the ensemble acting of the entire cast, the family dynamic is entirely believable.The real surprise for me, however, was Jeremy Northam in the role of Sir Robert Morton, KC, MP. Although Northam's performances in films such as ""Gosford Park"" and ""Enigma"" have been enjoyable, his portrayal of the aristocratic barrister quietly sizzled with sensual undertones that would do a handsome brooding Jane Austen hero proud. I found myself waiting for him to come onstage, as it were; and wishing that I could hear his moving summation to the jury; and that I might be allowed to follow Sir Robert's romantic pursuit of Miss Winslow. The last lines of the film are simply tantalizing.Much of this ""wanting more of Morton"" derives not only from Northam's portrayal, but also from playwright Terrance Rattigan's technique of having the action take place offstage. The technique, which dates back to Greek tragedy, contributes to the dramatic tension of ""The Winslow Boy."" The very device of having characters relate the events taking place elsewhere, however, will likely render the drama inaccessible to some viewers, who demand fast-paced visual action.

A cadet is accused of having stolen some money and expelled from his military academy. His father will fight to the finish in order to prove the guiltlessness of the child. And he will succeed. But this battle makes us discover some fundamental dimension of English society and English institutions, the Parliament among others. To succeed the lawyer will have to go back to the 1628 procedure of the Petition of Right against Charles I. Brilliant possibility that enables any citizen, who has the means to do so, to start an action against his or her majesty's government, against the Crown, to redress some wrong decision. This will reveal something even deeper about this procedure : the principle that  right  is more important than  justice  in a common law judicial system. The state has to abide by the principle  Let Right be done  to really not only bring justice to the suing party but to improve the system for everyone by getting to a decision that will impose its jurisprudence on the system. Such an action enables the system to open its eyes and see what right is, what right should be for everyone. This procedure is an eye-opening action not only for the citizens but also for the institutions that are conservative by principle. This film is thus a great illustration of the main advantage of such common law over any other system. Any persistent citizen - who has the means to do so though - can force the system to improve itself and become fairer and more democratic. Democracy, freedom and justice can only come from this slow building of Right and not from laws that are passed by the institutions themselves and hence tend to be either dictated by public opinion, which is dangerous, or by some conservative trend of these institutions that always try to conserve themselves instead of redeeming themselves for the sake and interest of the people.This film becomes extremely moving when the main impetus of the father is to clear the reputation of his own son, and his own family, endangered by some unsupported and unjust accusation. Victory in this context is soul-tearing, but the lawyer's attitude is also an inspiration for us : never judge from emotions and always keep cool and collected, always use your mind and your objective distanciation from superficial facts to come to a conviction, and in this case to blend your conviction that the child is innocent with the reversal of the first conviction this child has been the victim of.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan",5,Right is better than justice,1041379200,"01 1, 2003",2003,2587,"['British', 'film', 'British', 'right', 'very', 'end', 'mental', 'fingers', 'cadet', 'accused', 'having', 'stolen', 'money', 'expelled', 'military', 'academy', 'father', 'will', 'fight', 'finish', 'order', 'prove', 'guiltlessness', 'child', 'will', 'succeed', 'battle', 'discover', 'fundamental', 'dimension', 'English', 'society', 'English', 'institutions', 'Parliament', 'others', 'succeed', 'lawyer', 'will', 'have', 'go', 'back', '1628', 'procedure', 'Petition', 'Right', 'Charles', 'Brilliant', 'possibility', 'citizen', 'who', 'means', 'do', 'so', 'start', 'action', 'majesty', 'government', 'Crown', 'redress', 'wrong', 'decision', 'will', 'reveal', 'something', 'even', 'deeper', 'procedure', 'principle', 'right', 'more', 'important', 'justice', 'common', 'law', 'judicial', 'system', 'state', 'abide', 'principle', 'Let', 'Right', 'be', 'done', 'really', 'not', 'only', 'bring', 'justice', 'suing', 'party', 'improve', 'system', 'everyone', 'getting', 'decision', 'will', 'impose', 'jurisprudence', 'system', 'action', 'system', 'open', 'eyes', 'see', 'what', 'right', 'what', 'right', 'should', 'be', 'everyone', 'procedure', 'eye-opening', 'action', 'not', 'only', 'citizens', 'also', 'institutions', 'are', 'conservative', 'principle', 'film', 'thus', 'great', 'illustration', 'main', 'advantage', 'such', 'common', 'law', 'other', 'system', 'persistent', 'citizen', 'who', 'means', 'do', 'so', 'can', 'force', 'system', 'improve', 'become', 'fairer', 'more', 'democratic', 'Democracy', 'freedom', 'justice', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'slow', 'building', 'Right', 'not', 'laws', 'are', 'passed', 'institutions', 'hence', 'tend', 'be', 'either', 'dictated', 'public', 'opinion', 'dangerous', 'conservative', 'trend', 'institutions', 'always', 'try', 'conserve', 'instead', 'redeeming', 'sake', 'interest', 'people.This', 'film', 'extremely', 'moving', 'when', 'main', 'impetus', 'father', 'clear', 'reputation', 'own', 'son', 'own', 'family', 'endangered', 'unsupported', 'unjust', 'accusation', 'Victory', 'context', 'soul-tearing', 'lawyer', 'attitude', 'also', 'inspiration', 'never', 'judge', 'emotions', 'always', 'keep', 'cool', 'collected', 'always', 'use', 'mind', 'objective', 'distanciation', 'superficial', 'facts', 'come', 'conviction', 'case', 'blend', 'conviction', 'child', 'innocent', 'reversal', 'first', 'conviction', 'child', 'been', 'victim', 'of.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Perpignan']",The Winslow Boy VHS

Instead David Mamet (House of Games, The Spanish Prisoner, Glengarry Glen  Ross) in his movie adaption of Terrance Rattigan's ever popular British  play, based on a true story, creates an English world of 1910 on the eve of  WWI, women's sufferage and the rest of the modern age. With dramatic,  precisely crafted dialogue he raises such questions as: the standing of the  least before the highest, justice vs. moral truth, the costs of the pursuit  of truth and the difficulty seperating truth from lies. Featuring Jeremy  Northam (Emma, The Net), Nigel Hawthorne (Madness of King George), Rebecca  Pigeon (Spanish Prisoner, and also David Mamet's wife), her brother Matthew  Pigeon, Gemma Jones (Sense &amp; Sensibility), Colin Stinton, and thirteen  year old Guy Edwards as Ronnie Winslow, the accused. They all do fine job,  but particularly outstanding are Northam as Sir Robert Morton, Hawthorne as  the father Arthur Winslow, Jones as Grace Winslow and Edwards. Benoit  Delhomme's John Singer Sargeant like cinema photography brings to life end  of Victorian England. As Mamet wrote in Three Uses of the Knife:  &quot;During the O.J.

516852,A17JVI15BRY90P,B0000372I2,James T. Wheeler,"[3, 5]","With this being one of the last, if not the last, performances by Nigel Hawthorne, my wife and I expected something really good.  Moreover, other reviewers had generally rated the show with five stars.  We enjoyed the story, to be sure, but giving it five stars may do an injustice to other outstanding British and other productions we've seen lately.  Not least of these have been ""North and South"" and ""Pride and Prejudice.""  Both the 1979 and 1995 renderings of the latter fall into a five star mode for us.The story line revolves around the Winslow family, with Nigel Hawthorne as patriarch.  He and his wife, played by Gemma Jones, have three offspring, a daughter and two sons.  The younger son, Ronnie, gets into trouble at his Navy prep school when he's only 13 years old.  A money order is stolen, forged, and cashed, and Ronnie is accused of the crime.  After a one-sided review, Ronnie is expelled in disgrace and sent home.  Mr. Winslow is outraged and spends the next several years of his life, along with a great share of the family fortune fighting for legal justice.  The Winslow daughter, portrayed by Rebecca Pidgeon, is also drawn deeply into the case with little or no reward for her efforts.Pacing of the show is noticeably slow. It plods along for the better part of 1 hour and 45 minutes with no hint of what will come.  There is little wit and humor that you'd expect from a cast featuring Mr. Hawthorne.  This is a dead serious drama all the way.  One wonders if more background music would have helped.  Also, as with other British productions, it may be advisable for we Americans to switch on subtitles.  British idioms and sayings are not easy for us to pick up and the actors move on quickly with their dialogue.Conclusion of the show is particularly bothersome as we are told that the case is eloquently argued in court by the hero, Sir Robert Morton, well played by Jeremy Northam.  But we don't get to see any of the key proceedings and the long-sought victory is almost treated as an afterthought.  To top it off, Sir Robert makes a vague comment to the Winslow daughter that might suggest a romantic follow-up on his part.  But there the story ends abruptly.  What could David Mamet, the writer and director, have been thinking?  Did he run out of money?  Or, maybe Mr. Hawthorne's failing health may have affected the production?As to the ""making of"" featurette, it was skimpy to say the least.  Yes, there were brief interviews with Mr. Mamet and Mr. Hawthorne, but very little else.For those interested in period dramas, there are better choices, as noted above.

Be even more surprised that it's rated &quot;G.&quot;  But don't miss this gem. Most of the story focuses on the case of a boy accused of stealing a postal order, and its effect on the middle-class Winslow family in 1912 England. The new screen version surpasses the original with the palpable sexual tension between the characters played by Jeremy Northam and Rebecca Pidgeon. The few exchanges between Sir Robert (Northam) and Catherine Winslow (Pidgeon) are skillfully interwoven by Mamet. They're the sexiest couple in recent memory without the lewdness or voyeurism of blockbuster cinema.The DVD features voiceover commentary by Mamet and the main cast.  I expected Mamet to be something like Quentin Tarantino's grumpier older brother, but was completely charmed when he introduced himself as &quot;Dave&quot; Mamet and affectionately called Pidgeon &quot;Becks&quot; throughout the commentary.

516854,A28RXZ72BE0UQC,B0000372I2,Kosmos,"[2, 2]","Movies, these days, come loaded with such a definitely bombastic style that they appear to deny the existence of the notion that restraint has its peculiar virtue and beauty. In this sense, the &quot;Winslow Boy&quot; will only be truly appreciated by those who do have a good grasp of that notion. The film is a perfect example to illustrate that an underplayed performance is much more effective and satisfying than an overplayed one; that self-restraining style has more meaning and class than a say-all-you-feel style. Put in other words, isn't it more exciting to see a beautiful woman in a suggestive dress than see her in the nude! Yes, leave the rest to one's own imagination and intimacy! Despite the grave nature of the legal issue raised in the movie, every aspect in it is underplayed and delivered with an appropriate touch of reticence that the conflicts it generate seem more real and honest. The Winslow Boy incident is nothing but a catalyst and a tool to develop characters, conflicts and relationships. Among them the relationship between Rebecca Pidgeon and Jeremy Northam is a model of adult sexuality at its finest. In essence, this movie is a drama which hides a covert, clever, smoldering romance which has an atypical happy ending that stimulates your imagination beyond the movie. Deep underneath their skin one can feel the sexual tension between them that is kept in check by their cool heads and the notion that it is always better not to let one's emotions just explode all at once. Emotions should be managed and not let run loose at will. After the ending, one comes to the realization that long lasting relationships are built step by step, with time and effort, and with a good dose of intellectual foreplay to top it off. By the way, this DVD comes with an alternative audio commentary by the director and the principal cast that is very informative and entertaining, and it is also a good example of why every good film should add such a track to its DVD format. This may have been the best performance by Jeremy Northam (he certainly has a resemblance and style of Laurence Olivier) , and Rebecca Pidgeon was perfect in her role, and those who critized her for being too cold and emotionless, and other aspects of this movie, just do not get the deliberate design of this movie.",5,This film stands for: &quot;less sometines means more&quot;,959040000,"05 23, 2000",2000,2315,"['Movies', 'days', 'come', 'loaded', 'definitely', 'bombastic', 'style', 'appear', 'deny', 'existence', 'notion', 'restraint', 'peculiar', 'virtue', 'beauty', 'sense', 'quot', 'Winslow', 'Boy', 'quot', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'truly', 'appreciated', 'who', 'do', 'have', 'good', 'grasp', 'notion', 'film', 'perfect', 'example', 'illustrate', 'underplayed', 'performance', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'satisfying', 'overplayed', 'one', 'self-restraining', 'style', 'more', 'meaning', 'class', 'say-all-you-feel', 'style', 'Put', 'other', 'words', ""n't"", 'more', 'exciting', 'see', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'suggestive', 'dress', 'see', 'nude', 'Yes', 'leave', 'rest', 'one', 'own', 'imagination', 'intimacy', 'grave', 'nature', 'legal', 'issue', 'raised', 'movie', 'aspect', 'underplayed', 'delivered', 'appropriate', 'touch', 'reticence', 'conflicts', 'generate', 'seem', 'more', 'real', 'honest', 'Winslow', 'Boy', 'incident', 'nothing', 'catalyst', 'tool', 'develop', 'characters', 'conflicts', 'relationships', 'relationship', 'Rebecca', 'Pidgeon', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'model', 'adult', 'sexuality', 'finest', 'essence', 'movie', 'drama', 'covert', 'clever', 'smoldering', 'romance', 'atypical', 'happy', 'ending', 'imagination', 'movie', 'Deep', 'skin', 'one', 'can', 'feel', 'sexual', 'tension', 'kept', 'check', 'cool', 'heads', 'notion', 'always', 'better', 'not', 'let', 'one', 'emotions', 'just', 'explode', 'once', 'Emotions', 'should', 'be', 'managed', 'not', 'let', 'run', 'loose', 'will', 'ending', 'one', 'realization', 'long', 'lasting', 'relationships', 'are', 'built', 'step', 'step', 'time', 'effort', 'good', 'dose', 'intellectual', 'foreplay', 'top', 'off', 'way', 'DVD', 'alternative', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'principal', 'cast', 'very', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'also', 'good', 'example', 'why', 'good', 'film', 'should', 'add', 'track', 'DVD', 'format', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'performance', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'certainly', 'resemblance', 'style', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'Rebecca', 'Pidgeon', 'was', 'perfect', 'role', 'who', 'critized', 'being', 'too', 'cold', 'emotionless', 'other', 'aspects', 'movie', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'deliberate', 'design', 'movie']",The Winslow Boy VHS

This remake, based upon the play by Terrence Rattigan, takes place in the early part of the twentieth century, before the advent of World War I. A thirteen year old Naval cadet is excused of stealing a postal order and subsequently expelled. He claims that he did not do it, despite seeming evidence to the contrary. His upstanding and prosperous family rally around him. After going to the Naval academy from which he was expelled and having their entreaties fall upon deaf ears, they decide to take the unprecedented step of suing the Crown.The family retains the services of a well respected barrister, Sir Robert Morton, played with British reserve by the always wonderful Jeremy Northam, who agrees to represent the boy. The case becomes a cause celebre all over England, and Sir Morton's client becomes known as that Winslow boy, a notoriety that shakes the boy's very proper family to its core. While the case wends its way through the English legal system, tension between the boy's intelligent, bluestocking sister, gravely played by Rebecca Pidgeon, and his barrister bubbles to the surface.The courtroom scenes do not dominate the drama, though they are interesting. The outcome of the lawsuit is, of course, predictable. Yet, it is of no consequence, since the movie is not really about the resolution of the case. The movie ends on a note of romantic hope, as it wittily augers what is surely to come.Another version of this film, released in 1948, is just as good as this one. There, Margaret Leighton does a better job than Rebecca Pidgeon in the role of the bluestocking sister, while the barrister role is better served by Jeremy Northam than Robert Donat. It is easy to make the comparison, since both films are nearly word for word the same. One is shot in black and white, the other in color.

516856,A3CSDBDV77Z0VI,B0000372I2,lily t.,"[0, 0]","When I saw this film in 1999, I thought it was terrific. But the world has changed drastically since both in terms of globalization and the erosion of civil liberties in the common law countries, so fifteen years later, for me, at least, it left a great deal to be desired.Mamet, the prince of affectless characters who live in bubbles and have great difficulty with direct communication, fails to bring Rattigan's play to the screen with the power and life it might have had. While Jones, Northam and especially Hawthorn are skilled enough to transcend his awkward direction, the Pidgeons are not and it mars the whole endeavor. Hawthorn can infuse the usual Mamatianisms with spirit eg: Yes, yes, yes and mean Well; Perhaps; I am at a total loss, but Rebecca Pidgeon delivers them in such staccato fashion as to render her character lifeless. In the end, instead of embodying stoic restraint, she gives a wooden performance.So what do we end up with-- the story of a prideful patriarch willing to  financially ruin his family to clear the name of his young son, a naval cadet accused of stealing a few shillings? Possibly.A compilation of the reserved manners and mores of a world that would be shattered in the upcoming war? Not really, since there is little suggestion of the underpinning emotions that are supposed to be driving the pursuit of justice/right at the expense of the personal life.The insularity of father and daughter as they sally forth in their conviction that the case must be brought to trial despite the loss of the daughters marriage prospects and the end of the wastrel eldest son's Oxford education? To some extent.The story of right being done--and under that right, the very important story of common law in a country which allows its citizens to bring suit against the Crown itself? Well, no. Sir Bobby's supposedly impassioned off screen speech which wins the trial is recounted  by the breathless maid.A clash of ideas  and a subtle interplay between the sexes vis -a -vis the daughter of the house and their advocate? On Sir Bobby's part perhaps since he displays the subtlest hints of attraction though the romance is underdeveloped and there is little suggestion of chemistry on Pidgeon's part.I'm not sure what the point was but it seems that the original film version is considered by many of the reviewers to be much superior and in keeping with Rattigan's intent. I think I'll put it on my watchlist.Lackluster and worth seeing only if you are into dry drama, Hawthorn's acting, or as a good friend once said--'I only ask two things concerning historical productions: Is Jeremy Northam starring and is he wearing tights?'

David Mamet (director) and the screenwriters seem to have dodged any opportunities for high drama, suspense or intensity which is absolutely necessary to making a courtroom movie. For example, at the end when the verdict is reached, the maid comes in and tells the family how it went. ""It was very emotional. The defense's speech was so powerful. Many of us cried. I cried too."" But we never find out WHAT he exactly said. Why not show the scene in the court instead of just talking about it? We see very little of the courtroom proceedings and none with the prosecuting attorney interrogating Ronnie Winslow. There is only one interview with the defense attorney and even that was as calm, cool and relaxed as a walk in the park.

516859,A3O0Q743WSQ2AJ,B0000372I2,Margaret Magnus,"[80, 83]","I have probably watched this one 15-20 times. It's based on a true story, and there was evidently a play about it which preceded the film.I saw it the second and the third time because the tenor was so appealing to me, the heroism of the father so compelling and the love story so masterfully executed. It could be the best ending I've ever seen on film. Furthermore, Mamet's grasp of that time and place was solid enough, that I was convinced he was born in England before the Second World War. And the acting was incredible -- particularly that of Jeremy Northam who admittedly had the best part, but also all the other major parts were played very, very well.And then for a time with each new viewing, I saw things I hadn't seen before. The plot is so complete and well conceived, that I'm left a little breathless.The central theme of the film, it seems to me, is ""Let Right be done."" Everybody gives up everything for Right. Only the incompetent maid doesn't observe any loss, though it is her unswerving faith that makes her impossible to fire. If she must go, then the point is lost somehow. So the entire ship sinks or floats as one. The father spends all the family money and sacrifices his health. The wayward older brother must leave Oxford. The daughter gives up her marriage. . All of it reasonably cheerfully. And for what? For Right. Yet on the surface, it seems ""such a very trivial affair"". A kid is accused of stealing a couple bucks. The discrepancy between the triviality of the case and the forces brought to bear upon it suggests something very powerful.And then in the final sentence, everything is restored. It's beautiful.All aspects of this problem of Right are addressed. It's not only about the comfort of the boy, whose life would be easier without the publicity. Nor is it about his honor. ""The case has much wider implications than that."" The father describes himself as fighting for `justice'. But it's not even about that.It's about Right. The only thing that has the power to cause Sir Robert to show his emotions is when Right is done -- ""very easy to do Justice, very hard to do Right."" And I think it is because Sir Robert sees the distinction, that he is able to play the trick without losing his moral ground. He plays the trick to take control of the House of Commons, to discredit a witness, to determine whether the boy is telling the truth, and even to trip up Edmund Curry so he can seize the girl at a distance. Kate initially mistakes this trickiness for simple avarice, and although she lays into him for being so `passionless', she shares his capacity to keep a level head. Though they both do have their knee-jerk emotional responses. She falls for some guilty radical just because he takes on the establishment. And he's wrong about women's sufferage. But he shows his eligibility for her by sacrificing his career for Right. And she also demonstrates her eligibility for the big league by sacrificing for the cause of Right her only hope of a decent marriage. They make a very convincing pair.",5,Let Right Be Done,1071014400,"12 10, 2003",2003,3044,"['have', 'probably', 'watched', 'one', '15-20', 'times', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'there', 'was', 'evidently', 'play', 'preceded', 'film.I', 'saw', 'second', 'third', 'time', 'tenor', 'was', 'so', 'appealing', 'heroism', 'father', 'so', 'compelling', 'love', 'story', 'so', 'masterfully', 'executed', 'could', 'be', 'best', 'ending', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'Furthermore', 'Mamet', 'grasp', 'time', 'place', 'was', 'solid', 'enough', 'was', 'convinced', 'was', 'born', 'England', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'acting', 'was', 'incredible', 'particularly', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'who', 'admittedly', 'had', 'best', 'part', 'also', 'other', 'major', 'parts', 'were', 'played', 'very', 'very', 'well.And', 'then', 'time', 'new', 'viewing', 'saw', 'things', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'plot', 'so', 'complete', 'well', 'conceived', ""'m"", 'left', 'little', 'breathless.The', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'Let', 'Right', 'be', 'done', 'Everybody', 'up', 'everything', 'Right', 'Only', 'incompetent', 'maid', ""n't"", 'observe', 'loss', 'unswerving', 'faith', 'impossible', 'fire', 'must', 'go', 'then', 'point', 'lost', 'somehow', 'entire', 'ship', 'sinks', 'floats', 'one', 'father', 'family', 'money', 'health', 'wayward', 'older', 'brother', 'must', 'leave', 'Oxford', 'daughter', 'up', 'marriage', 'reasonably', 'cheerfully', 'what', 'Right', 'surface', 'such', 'very', 'trivial', 'affair', 'kid', 'accused', 'stealing', 'couple', 'bucks', 'discrepancy', 'triviality', 'case', 'forces', 'brought', 'bear', 'something', 'very', 'powerful.And', 'then', 'final', 'sentence', 'everything', 'restored', 'beautiful.All', 'aspects', 'problem', 'Right', 'are', 'addressed', 'not', 'only', 'comfort', 'boy', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'easier', 'publicity', 'honor', 'case', 'much', 'wider', 'implications', 'father', 'fighting', 'justice', 'not', 'even', 'that.It', 'Right', 'only', 'thing', 'power', 'cause', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'show', 'emotions', 'when', 'Right', 'done', 'very', 'easy', 'do', 'Justice', 'very', 'hard', 'do', 'Right', 'think', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'distinction', 'able', 'play', 'trick', 'losing', 'moral', 'ground', 'trick', 'take', 'control', 'House', 'Commons', 'discredit', 'witness', 'determine', 'boy', 'telling', 'truth', 'even', 'trip', 'up', 'Edmund', 'Curry', 'can', 'seize', 'girl', 'distance', 'Kate', 'initially', 'trickiness', 'simple', 'avarice', 'being', 'so', 'passionless', 'shares', 'capacity', 'keep', 'level', 'head', 'do', 'have', 'knee-jerk', 'emotional', 'responses', 'guilty', 'radical', 'just', 'establishment', 'wrong', 'women', 'sufferage', 'eligibility', 'sacrificing', 'career', 'Right', 'also', 'eligibility', 'big', 'league', 'sacrificing', 'cause', 'Right', 'only', 'hope', 'decent', 'marriage', 'make', 'very', 'convincing', 'pair']",The Winslow Boy VHS
516860,A152C8GYY25HAH,B0000372I2,Matthew Horner,"[6, 6]","The Winslow Boy is based on a famous legal case that occurred in England in 1908. A fourteen-year old boy was expelled from a British naval academy for allegedly stealing a five-schilling postal order, which is equivalent to just a few dollars. His father, believing his child's innocence, sued the state in order to clear his family's name. The story was turned into a successful play by Terrence Rattigan in 1948, and the playwright's work is the basis for this film by David Mamet. Mamet, who has written many plays himself, has previously been known for more visceral fare, but he handles this more sedate material with flair.The focus of The Winslow Boy is not on the trial. We are never shown the inside of a courtroom. Instead, it focuses on the effects of the case on the family. It shows us how difficult and costly doing the right thing can be. We also see the high price of notoriety. Even today, when people willing display their problems on national TV talk shows, notoriety still has its costs, I believe We can imagine how devastating it must have been back in the days when privacy and self-esteem were held in high regard.The story is one which begins rather slowly. We get a lot of character development, but the payoff is that it becomes riveting by the second half. Much of this is due to the superb acting of Nigel Hawthorne and Jeremy Northam. Hawthorne plays Arthur Winslow, the father who instigates the case. Hawthorne brings dignity and grace to a character who otherwise might seem a bit mad. Winslow never raises his voice. He quietly and persistently pursues his goal, not realizing until its too late that his family's lives are in danger of being ruined. Yet, can people pursing right ever be truly ruined? That is the question the movie raises. Jeremy Northam, who reminds me of a young Laurence Olivier, is astounding as Sir Robert Morton, the famous lawyer who finally agrees to take the case. He is especially interesting in his interaction with the daughter, Catherine Winslow [Rebecca Pidgeon]. She is a brilliant woman who works for women's rights, a thing which appalls Sir Robert. At the same time, we must remember a truism about relationships: A strong person tends to be attracted to another strong person who disagrees with them sooner than they are attracted to a weak person who agrees with them. This idea sums up the relationship between Catherine and Robert, and it all becomes quite romantic in an understated British way.Obviously, this is a cerebral movie. Action fans, this means that nobody gets beaten up and nothing blows up. Exit polls showed it to be most liked by people over the age of forty-five, but I feel that many thinking people over the age of twelve might enjoy it, if they know what to expect going in.",4,Mamet's fine adaptation of the 1948 Rattigan play,1016582400,"03 20, 2002",2002,2771,"['Winslow', 'Boy', 'based', 'famous', 'legal', 'case', 'occurred', 'England', '1908', 'fourteen-year', 'old', 'boy', 'was', 'expelled', 'British', 'naval', 'academy', 'allegedly', 'stealing', 'five-schilling', 'postal', 'order', 'equivalent', 'just', 'few', 'dollars', 'father', 'believing', 'child', 'innocence', 'sued', 'state', 'order', 'clear', 'family', 'name', 'story', 'was', 'turned', 'successful', 'play', 'Terrence', 'Rattigan', '1948', 'playwright', 'work', 'basis', 'film', 'David', 'Mamet', 'Mamet', 'who', 'written', 'many', 'plays', 'previously', 'been', 'known', 'more', 'visceral', 'fare', 'more', 'sedate', 'material', 'flair.The', 'focus', 'Winslow', 'Boy', 'not', 'trial', 'are', 'never', 'shown', 'inside', 'courtroom', 'Instead', 'effects', 'case', 'family', 'how', 'difficult', 'costly', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'also', 'see', 'high', 'price', 'notoriety', 'Even', 'today', 'when', 'people', 'willing', 'display', 'problems', 'national', 'TV', 'talk', 'notoriety', 'still', 'costs', 'believe', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'devastating', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'privacy', 'self-esteem', 'were', 'held', 'high', 'regard.The', 'story', 'one', 'rather', 'slowly', 'get', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'payoff', 'riveting', 'second', 'half', 'Much', 'due', 'superb', 'acting', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Hawthorne', 'Arthur', 'Winslow', 'father', 'who', 'case', 'Hawthorne', 'dignity', 'grace', 'character', 'who', 'otherwise', 'might', 'seem', 'bit', 'mad', 'Winslow', 'never', 'voice', 'quietly', 'persistently', 'goal', 'not', 'realizing', 'too', 'late', 'family', 'lives', 'are', 'danger', 'being', 'ruined', 'can', 'people', 'pursing', 'right', 'ever', 'be', 'truly', 'ruined', 'question', 'movie', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'who', 'young', 'Laurence', 'Olivier', 'astounding', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'Morton', 'famous', 'lawyer', 'who', 'finally', 'take', 'case', 'especially', 'interesting', 'interaction', 'daughter', 'Catherine', 'Winslow', '[', 'Rebecca', 'Pidgeon', ']', 'brilliant', 'woman', 'who', 'women', 'rights', 'thing', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'same', 'time', 'must', 'remember', 'truism', 'relationships', 'strong', 'person', 'be', 'attracted', 'strong', 'person', 'who', 'sooner', 'are', 'attracted', 'weak', 'person', 'who', 'idea', 'up', 'relationship', 'Catherine', 'Robert', 'quite', 'romantic', 'understated', 'British', 'way.Obviously', 'cerebral', 'movie', 'Action', 'fans', 'nobody', 'beaten', 'up', 'nothing', 'up', 'Exit', 'polls', 'showed', 'be', 'most', 'liked', 'people', 'age', 'forty-five', 'feel', 'many', 'thinking', 'people', 'age', 'twelve', 'might', 'enjoy', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'going']",The Winslow Boy VHS

516862,A2ZX5079G6KROH,B0000372I2,"Mike J. Rice ""'Mike Rice, Cultural Historian""","[1, 3]","Dave Mamet, he of massively male play-cum-movies like Glenngarry Glen Ross and American Buffalo, is toying in the melon patch of Merchant-Ivory and playwright Terence Rattigan in this wonderful film. I may be the only one who thinks so but I believe the director has the beginnings of a comedy here. I'll explain later.Poor young Winslow, the great hope of a proud upper middle class family, has been sacked at Osbourne. His crime? Nothing as base as say dropping his &quot;aye-chez.&quot; No, he's alleged to have stolen and forged a five pound postal money order in a fellow cadet's name. Enter Arthur, the proud father of this prodigy. This is a low blow to the Winslow Honor. Arthur shall fight this calumny if it means the family fortune. Nigel Hawthorne shows us the highs and lows of Winslow family pride, as Arthur, supported ably by Gemma Jones as his wife, Grace. Ronnie Winslow, his black sheep brother Dickie and the older Winslows then step mostly offstage. Young Ronnie is later seen being interrupted in the midst of a tennis game, having happily and readily adapted to a new school.The family is teetering on the brink of insolvency. The action has shifted to the two characters I believe are really the focus of the film: Superbarrister Sir Robert Morton and Arthur's headstrong daughter Catherine Winslow. Ms. Winslow wears interesting sunglasses and her manner is brusque and unfeminine. Sir Robert is smitten instantly if you can grasp almost invisible movie subtext. The romance seems doomed at the couple's first meeting. Ms. Winslow remembers Sir Robert's earlier tiff with a suffragist group she supports. She believes that Sir Robert may not be able to save the family name. Sir Robert is taken aback- and I say, delighted- to be so grandly challenged from such an interesting quarter. It is cut and thrust between this unlikely pair for the rest of the film. Neither Sir Robert nor Catherine gives an inch.An enormous and expensive public relations and advertising campaign is mounted to exonerate Young Winslow. Though the period of the film seems to be just before World War 1, the newspaper headlines and ad tactics appear similar to those employed today. Even the bloody Kaiser is evoked as a symbol of evil in the battle to prove the boy's innocence.Mr and Mrs. Winslow are apparently too sensitive to appear in Court or stand in the gallery at Commons as Sir Robert conjures political business on poor Ronnie's behalf. Ms. Winslow does this instead. She brings news, bad or good, back to the Winslows at home. Meanwhile, the belt must be tightened, the purse grows lighter. Cheaper rations must suffice, the maid may be let go. Never mind. The great question is whether Sir Robert is making headway with Ms. Winslow. Does he know what he is doing? It is a very long way to first base here.There is a sharp interrogation sequence in which Sir Robert questions Ronnie closely. Young Winslow makes mistakes that dismay his family in answering Sir Robert. Thats alright, the innocence of these mistakes has convinced Sir Robert the boy has been wrongly charged.There is bad news and good news as the campaign ebbs and flows. The privations at home contrast with successes in court and commons. Ms. Winslow's assessment of the barrister has changed not a whit. Sir Robert is confident. Ms. Winslow is unconvinced. The audience has no idea where this is going. It is particularly difficult to read Catherine. She simply has no screen subtext. Some critics say actress Rebecca Pidgeon is not playing the part correctly. They believe Mamet's girlfriend is giving a bad performance here. She is not. It is for Sir Robert, played by the intelligent Jeremy Northam, to provide all the character shading necessary to untangle this web. He isn't interrogating a witness, he is watching Ms. Winslow's reaction to the witness, perhaps not necessarily with a view toward winning, but to simply get to the bottom of Catherine. Exonerating poor Ronnie is not Sir Robert's goal, its winning &quot;Sis&quot; over that matters. Except you can't quite be sure this is true until the film pays off; Not with just a single surprise, but two of them.

From Northam to Jones, this film was so much more then the quiet cover portrayed. I had never seen Jeremy Northam in a movie before and was thrilled to find yet another wonderful British actor.The story of the Postal order and the family who tries to clear its name is wonderful. The family interacts like a true family would showing just enough affection without being sappy. Stiff upper lip and all that rot. I was fond of Dickie and his way of saying everything in such a P.C way. I loved the loving way that Arthur dealt with Ronnie....that was a beautiful scene. A father never wants to think that his son has lied to him, but the close relationship they had was lovely.""For a lie cannot be had between us. I shall know it Ronnie. I shall know it. Did you steal this postal order?""""No Father I didn't.""What a shame that more family can't share that kind of honesty. I was also touched by the way that everyone looked out for the boy. But I have to say that my favorite characters were Sir. Robert Morton (Northam) and Catharine Winslow ( Mamet ) Their banter back and forth was superb! They each gave as good as they got and finally found themselves coming together I a kind of secret romance.""Perhaps I shall see you there again? Up in the gallery?""""No. Across the floor.

First, I did not at all care for R.P.'s smirking performance as Kate Winslow; I did not feel that there were great unspoken depths--on the contrary, I found her entirely one dimensional.  There was also some excellent dialogue in the first film version that was not carried over to the second.  I have not read or seen the play, and do not know if the dialogue I missed was in fact part of the original screen adaptation, but even if it was Mamet should have retained it.  What I specifically have in mind is the moment when Kate and Sir Robert meet.  In the first film, Kate is expecting her fiance and flings open the front door with a &quot;John, you're late!&quot;, only to find Sir Robert standing there, looking very posh and remote in his evening clothes.  She says, &quot;Oh, I'm sorry, I was expecting a friend.&quot;  As it turns out, of course, it is Sir Robert and not John who turns out to be the truest friend to her and her family.A scene that was carried over to the new version is the one in which Winslow wants to drop the case because it may threaten Kate's engagement, and Kate assures Sir Robert that her fiance will remain loyal.  In the original, Robert queries Kate on this in a sudden and abrupt way that makes it clear he is testing her resolve, and Kate replies in a way that makes clear that although she claims John will hold firm, she's pretty sure that he will not.  When Sir Robert sees that she is prepared to sacrifice her future to the principle of right (for, like Sir Robert, she cares more about the principle involved than clearing her brother), he softens towards her.  Indeed, although this film is a fine romance (of the stiff-upper-lip school), thanks to Leighton's performance it is also far more appealingly feminist than the remake.Leighton and Hardwicke are quite marvelous in the 1940s version, but at the center of it is the great Robert Donat, with his white-faced handsomeness, his dark gaze, his beautifully melancholy voice, and his sadly detached manner.  The delicacy with which he works his way through the film, with his restraint and remoteness making the moments of emotion or flirtation all the more affecting, is extraordinary.

In the original, Robert queries Kate on this in a sudden and abrupt way that makes it clear he is testing her resolve, and Kate replies in a way that makes clear that although she claims John will hold firm, she's pretty sure that he will not. When Sir Robert sees that she is prepared to sacrifice her future to the principle of right (for, like Sir Robert, she cares more about the principle involved than clearing her brother), he softens towards her. Indeed, although this film is a fine romance (of the stiff-upper-lip school), thanks to Leighton's performance it is also far more appealingly feminist than the remake.Leighton and Hardwicke are quite marvelous in the 1940s version, but at the center of it is the great Robert Donat, with his white-faced handsomeness, his dark gaze, his beautifully melancholy voice, and his sadly detached manner. The delicacy with which he works his way through the film, with his restraint and remoteness making the moments of emotion or flirtation all the more affecting, is extraordinary. Northam's performance is in the same vein, and also superior, but don't miss Donat!",3,"Worthwhile, But See Donat Version",1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,2342,"['excellent', 'film', 'J.N', 'N.H.', 'are', 'especially', 'good', 'had', 'two', 'major', 'reservations', 'First', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'R.P', 'smirking', 'performance', 'Kate', 'Winslow', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'were', 'great', 'unspoken', 'depths', 'contrary', 'found', 'entirely', 'one', 'dimensional', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'first', 'film', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'carried', 'second', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'seen', 'play', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'dialogue', 'missed', 'was', 'fact', 'part', 'original', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'even', 'was', 'Mamet', 'should', 'have', 'retained', 'What', 'specifically', 'have', 'mind', 'moment', 'when', 'Kate', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'meet', 'first', 'film', 'Kate', 'expecting', 'fiance', 'flings', 'open', 'front', 'door', 'John', ""'re"", 'late', 'only', 'find', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'standing', 'there', 'looking', 'very', 'posh', 'remote', 'evening', 'clothes', 'Oh', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'was', 'expecting', 'friend', 'out', 'course', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'not', 'John', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'truest', 'friend', 'family.A', 'scene', 'was', 'carried', 'new', 'version', 'one', 'Winslow', 'drop', 'case', 'may', 'threaten', 'Kate', 'engagement', 'Kate', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'fiance', 'will', 'remain', 'loyal', 'original', 'Robert', 'Kate', 'sudden', 'abrupt', 'way', 'clear', 'testing', 'resolve', 'Kate', 'replies', 'way', 'clear', 'John', 'will', 'hold', 'firm', 'pretty', 'sure', 'will', 'not', 'When', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'prepared', 'sacrifice', 'future', 'principle', 'right', 'Sir', 'Robert', 'more', 'principle', 'involved', 'clearing', 'brother', 'Indeed', 'film', 'fine', 'romance', 'stiff-upper-lip', 'school', 'thanks', 'Leighton', 'performance', 'also', 'far', 'more', 'appealingly', 'feminist', 'remake.Leighton', 'Hardwicke', 'are', 'quite', 'marvelous', '1940s', 'version', 'center', 'great', 'Robert', 'Donat', 'white-faced', 'handsomeness', 'dark', 'gaze', 'beautifully', 'melancholy', 'voice', 'sadly', 'detached', 'manner', 'delicacy', 'way', 'film', 'restraint', 'remoteness', 'making', 'moments', 'emotion', 'flirtation', 'more', 'affecting', 'extraordinary', 'Northam', 'performance', 'same', 'vein', 'also', 'superior', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Donat']",The Winslow Boy VHS
