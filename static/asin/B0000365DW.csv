He doesn't have to take on this job, but Williams' character just seems to be an all around do-gooder this time around.  He's also on a college campus this time instead of a high school.  It's nice to see him away from the gang banger environment and taking on the rich jocks and mafiosos.  His war buddie's dying request is that Treat gives his medal to his daughter.  Naturally this guy's daughter happens to be a teacher who gets beat up by these jocks, thus giving Williams another opportunity to play teacher.  He brings another crew with him along the way, including a black samurai, a rough chick and a heavy guy in a Hawaiian shirt.  More of the same classroom fun as Williams beats, shoots, kills and maims the student body.  One amusing scene has him lecturing the class on the Vietman war as he's engaged in a fistfight with a huge football player.  Another classic has him slitting a guy's throat with a pair of eyeglasses.  Ah, yes, Treat Williams is becoming the Charles Bronson of the new millenium.  Will he get to the bottom of this barrel of steroid clams?  Will he jump in the sack with that cute teacher?  Will his students survive his English literature class?

Anyhow, this second sequel is one of the more far fetched sequels. First, there wouldn't be kids in college that act that way - it's more like a high school. Kids throwing things around the room, etc..(this just struck me as funny)This movie has more gratuitous nudity scenes: The wet t-shirt contest, then a threesome by one of the bad guys in a warehouse! That was funny. The fight scenes in this movie are really good, though. The beginning fight was good, the pizza place battle was good, the classroom fight was funny, and the end battle was good too. The movie did take a turn in the middle, where the football team took a backburner to the drug dealers - but that was OK.
