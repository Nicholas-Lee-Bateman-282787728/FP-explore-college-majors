HAHA!!!  Nothing like NBC being greedy with the rights...  Not even John Stewart or Colbert was even allowed to show footage from the Olympics for their news coverage...  Although Colbert did his own interpretations with dolls that admittedly was even better than what was worth waiting for from NBC.,1,Will it be worth the wait time???,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,442,"['NBC', 'result', 'were', 'way', 'delayed', 'when', 'Olympics', 'happened', 'will', 'be', '7', 'weeks', 'release', 'date', 'get', 'DVD/B-Ray', 'results', 'HAHA', 'Nothing', 'NBC', 'being', 'greedy', 'rights', 'Not', 'even', 'John', 'Stewart', 'Colbert', 'was', 'even', 'allowed', 'show', 'footage', 'Olympics', 'news', 'coverage', 'Colbert', 'did', 'own', 'interpretations', 'dolls', 'admittedly', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'what', 'was', 'worth', 'waiting', 'NBC']",N/A

The coverage that they put in this DVD makes no sense.  The commentators are annoying and the camera angles SUCK.  It doesn't even include Usain Bolt winning!  Can you believe this!,1,OMG!
