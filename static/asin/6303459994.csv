375709,A1ELOBOYQD6UMQ,6303459994,Cagneyfan67,"[0, 0]",Slam Dunk Ernest was a great movie. Jim Varney was an incredible talent who was taken from us too son. He had immense range and depth as an actor but he was typecast in the Ernest role. He did a great job keeping that character alive and being successful for such a long run. Listening to the film critics write hogwash saying Ernest movies are for people ages 12 and under with a low iq annoys me. His films aren't meant to be like The Grapes of Wrath. In this movie Ernest has loved basketball all his life but he never was too good of a player so he didn't get play. His coworkers are jerky to him and don't even give him a chance to play for the team. When they are down a man they call him in and he loses the game for them. His coworkers don't take it easy on him and Ernest is left alone in the locker room feeling hurt. A basketball God appears and gives Ernest magic shoes to help him play great but warns him not to use the shoes the wrong way. As Ernest joins the team he plays great and his teammates all love him all of the sudden. They win a lot of games and a shady sports agent comes along and tempts Ernest with money and the girl of his dreams who sadly in the beginning seemed like a sweet girl but here she turns out to be a completely different person and is interested in money alone. Ernest betrays his teammates and becomes cocky and a jerk. One of his co workers's sons grows to worship Ernest and wants to be like Ernest. The young kid shakes off the notion of hard work and believes that all he needs is expensive shoes to play as he has witnessed Ernest become a great player due to his shoes alone. In the end Ernest turns good again in a nice gesture he throws away millions of dollars of a contract just to show the son that you make it through life working hard and not by taking short cuts. Ernest tells his teammates they can win it alone without him using team work. The boy's father who has the talent to play in the NBA never quite got his chance and the scouts notice his play in the end and want to sign him to a contract instead. With five seconds left Ernest goes in the game without the magic shoes and his teammates let him shoot the game winner. Ernest wins the game for the team and proves he didn't need the shoes after all. His coworkers have now grown to respect Ernest and are better friends with him. The movie has a lot of messages that are good. It's about being yourself and not trying to be anybody else and true friends with accept you as you are. It's also about once you have all that fame and fortune don't change or abandon your friends. It's a great children's film and a film for all ages. The movie was funny and Jim Varney made up for the film's flaws. I recommend this film to all movie goers. It's harmless fun and I think will uplift you when you are having a bad day. Cheers and enjoy!,5,Thanks Jim! A Fun Ernest Film With A Nice Message!

375722,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,6303459994,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 1]","""Slam Dunk Ernest"" is a tour de force comic performance from Jim Varney as his alter ego, Ernest P. Worrell, who has always dreamed of playing on a basketball team. Can your heart stand the pathos? Can your ribs stand the comedy? The film will fare well with young boys and dedicated Varney fans; also with Martians, single-celled organisms, fans of the Charlotte Hornets, and fans of mid-1990s Canadian cinema. Of course the plot is an excuse for Varney physical humor, and features extensive clumsiness and facial gestures (You know what I mean?) among the subplots about the temptations of money, fame, and women. Please don't miss Ernest's conversations with a mop, and (shudder) especially his own private fashion show. (This must be seen to be believed.)Because Ernest is inherently inept at sports, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar enters as the Archangel of Basketball in a role you will not soon forget. His presence made the film not exactly worthwhile, but somehow vastly more amusing for reasons I can't completely understand. Kareem gives Ernest magic shoes, but warns Ernest not to use the shoes for evil...but does Ernest listen? Take a gander at his entry into the game versus the Hornets in a carriage fit for Louis XVI and you'll have your answer. (An aside: I'm not a sports fan, but is a ping pong paddle legal in regulation basketball play? Just checking.) In the end Ernest learns valuable lessons about teamwork and friendship, and allows team captain Barry (Cylk Cozart, the best actor present by a long shot) to go to the NBA instead of him in a selfless act: don't miss the triumphant final nail-biting shot of the game. Bet you can't guess who wins.It turns out that Kareem was locked in a duel for the soul of both basketball and Ernest (the theology is a bit puzzling, I admit) all along, not that the limousine ride foreshadowed that at all.... I won't tell you who wins the karmic struggle, but I will tell you that if you watch the credits very closely you will notice that the On Set Dresser was Herb Noseworthy, and that three chefs were on the crew. All in all the credits were a pretty entertaining part of the film.This is a perfectly adequate if undistinguished Varney vehicle, and will please his fans and kids who are the obvious target audience. It does attempt to instill the concepts of good values and sportsmanship, despite being tediously stupid.
