Well if you do, then you remember sitting in front the the tv, for that new weekly episode of ""Are you Afraid of the Dark?"" My good friend and myself wanted to go back in time and remember what it felt like again to be easily entertained. Some now would say, the show is korny and not worth the time. However, I can safely say that even though some of the acting is a little lame, they are still great stories, that for the early to mid 90's were well written and original. You have to put yourself back into that frame of mind, and if you do, you will appreciate the episodes just as much as you did when you were 10 years old. I went for Season 2, I had seemed to remember more of the episodes from 2 instead of Season 1. And no worries, you may hear that this was a show filmed in Canada that Nickelodeon picked up..which is true, but any rumors about the intro being different is NOT true.

The series centers around a group of friends that tell spooky tales around a campfire. This show was the leader of the Nick at Night fans. It resembles Eerie Indiana to a degree but is way spookier. This season we hear tales of a locker that is haunter by a hippie, kids getting tested by aliens, a boarding school with an evil plot, a boy following his bicycle to the grave and a boy that will do anything to gain affection by a snob, even if it means turning into a monster in the process. This will forever be my favorite tv show from when I was a kid. These season sets are only released in Canada so be sure to grab them while you still can. I can see the price increasing after they stop manufacturing them- which will happen. The episode list is below. My favorite episodes are 4,6,7,10,11 and 12.
