I'm usually down in the dumps about something or other and that makes me lethargic. Most of the time, I don't want to get motivated to do anything. If you're like me, you will LOVE this workout. It is not difficult to follow. Denise Austin's dance moves are very well-explained and she is extremely understanding and compassionate. The dance moves are really fun. I was afraid that I wasn't going to be able to ""dance,"" but they're more graceful moves than dance moves, which I really appreciate because I find that whole monotonous movement thing in exercise really....BORING. There is nothing monotonous or boring about these dance moves. She makes it really fun and exciting. The music pumps you up and makes you want to move. I'm actually excited to exercise which is a first for me. What I love about the dance programs is that they are short 10-minute bursts. Each 10 min. segment is a different theme--latin, club funk, jazz, ballet etc. I was also afraid that I wouldn't like certain genres, but I did!  Becuase they are short and sweet, it keeps things interesting for you.  Also, you can customize the order of the programs.I would recommend this to anyone...it honestly does NOT matter what age you are. I'm a complete weakling when it comes to exercise and I found these exercises to be energizing and effective...and not difficult at all!The only segment that is a little challenging is the ballet section because she has you doing push ups for a very short period of time. I can't do push ups.

She may be the instructor, but the talented dancers behind her are doing a better job of dance movement that is pleasing to the eye.Better dance videos provide instruction in a ""mirror"" format so they are easier to follow.  For example, the instructor leads with his/her left foot, but cues you to use your right foot.  Denise does not do this.  She always leads with her right foot, which means that I have to lead with my left foot. It was awkward doing a dance video where I was taking off on my left foot all of the time.  Perhaps left-handers would like this video.  Most professional dance video let the audience lead with their right foot when learning new steps.This is a mediocre addition to an industry collection of dance videos.  Denise's instruction is also poor in that she does not give adequate cues for what she is going to do next.  Even the dancers behind her sometimes had a difficult time following her lead.  Also, the camera work is sometimes lacking when Denise is teaching a step and the camera shot is from the waist up.As far as the workout goes, it is a low impact, low-medium cardio routine.

Not this time however.  Sure she is still enthusiastic (I guess you need some personality), but this is better than usuall and it's a great and easy (yet effective) workout.She also is an instructor that isn't always in sync with the beat of the music, which can be frustrating, but not so much this time.  It's a great dvd with four different types of cardio work.  You can do them in any order (the dvd lets you programm how you want to do it), and there is ballet toning, Latin, jazz and club funky aerobics.  It's nice to have a variation going.  In each segment, you start of simply and then slowly add on moves to make a longer combo.  Then there is a toning segment that is easy to follow and uses usual kind of moves like crunches, planks and plies etc.I like this.  It's good for days when you want a bit of a lighter workout and if you are a beginner or intermediate.  If you are advanced you won't find this enough, but like me, it's good for the days where you can't be bothered with a tough routine.  I really enjoy it and if you are normally put off by Denise like I sometimes am, then don't worry, she is less overpowering here, but does an excellent job and you'll have fun with it I'm sure.",5,Actually pretty good :-o,1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,1434,"[""'m"", 'not', 'always', 'fan', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'not', 'not', 'good', 'instructor', 'pretty', 'good', 'instructor', 'way', 'too', 'top', 'extra', 'cheesey', 'enthusiasm', 'can', 'be', 'too', 'face', 'Not', 'time', 'however', 'Sure', 'still', 'enthusiastic', 'guess', 'need', 'personality', 'better', 'usuall', 'great', 'easy', 'yet', 'effective', 'workout.She', 'also', 'instructor', ""n't"", 'always', 'sync', 'beat', 'music', 'can', 'be', 'frustrating', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'great', 'dvd', 'four', 'different', 'types', 'cardio', 'work', 'can', 'do', 'order', 'dvd', 'programm', 'how', 'want', 'do', 'ballet', 'toning', 'Latin', 'jazz', 'club', 'funky', 'aerobics', 'nice', 'have', 'variation', 'going', 'segment', 'start', 'simply', 'then', 'slowly', 'add', 'moves', 'make', 'longer', 'combo', 'Then', 'toning', 'segment', 'easy', 'follow', 'usual', 'kind', 'moves', 'crunches', 'planks', 'plies', 'etc.I', 'good', 'days', 'when', 'want', 'bit', 'lighter', 'workout', 'are', 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'are', 'advanced', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'enough', 'good', 'days', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'tough', 'routine', 'really', 'enjoy', 'are', 'normally', 'put', 'off', 'Denise', 'sometimes', 'am', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'less', 'overpowering', 'here', 'excellent', 'job', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fun', ""'m"", 'sure']",Denise Austin-fat Burning Dance Mix

The cardio is great for a change of pace and for light days.  Adding in some jumping jacks between chapters and during the ""walk it out"" times definately helps to get your heart rate up.  The sculpting leaves some to be desired but has potential.  I have gotten much better results by doing that twice, and reversing the sides for the second time, so I can get an even workout on both sides.  She isn't very informative on form on this segment or on any in this one.  I have liked the fact that she puts stretch segments in her workouts, I just wish in this one that she would actually give time to do all the streches, not just a couple of them.  I just ignore the repition and hit the pause to hold in most cases.  She does give some different ways to stretch out which is nice.

I didn't make it through the whole thing, not because I couldn't phsyically, but mentally I just couldn't tolerate her anymore.  It wasn't energizing like a dance video should be.

It's not necessarily a difficult cardio program if you are at an intermediate level or above, but since the moves are different than some traditional aerobic programs, it's a good DVD to mix in with other videos during the week.  I am not a great dancer and usually have a hard time learning choreography, but this program was easy for me to follow.  I haven't tried the ballet toning segment yet, but the three cardio segments are fun to mix together for a thirty minute cardio workout.  It's a non-intimidating dance DVD that made me feel a little bit more comfortable about getting into dance.  I like Denise for her enthusiasm and positive attitude.  Some of the camera angles and cueing could have been better at times, but I think that's minor compared to the overall fun and effectiveness of the workout.

1020545,A1VABWDOUQLULZ,B000IHY9UM,S. K. Harrell,"[1, 1]","Bubbly as ever, Denise Austin presents a low intensity workout in three dance segments:  Jazz, Latin and Club/Pop.  The Jazz segments definitely is the most imaginative of the three, the moves and choreography seemingly more thought out.  This first segment is also the most fun of the three.  The Latin segment seems like she was struggling to come up with enough basic moves to fill the time allotted.  I must say, though, it's amusing to see Austin quietly tossing out 'ariba's here and there.  The Club segment is the weakest of the three and is quite repetitive.  Each segment can be done independently of the others or they can be done sequentially.If you are looking for a basic workout to keep you moving and occupied for 30 minutes this one is great.  If you want a hardcore aerobic workout this will not be for you.  As well, if you prefer your emphasis to be on dance rather than funked up aerobics, this DVD will disappoint.  Of the ensemble assisting her through each segment it is clear who the two most natural or trained dancers are, and Austin is not one of them.  This is evident in her lack of clear instruction of dance moves, rather than just keeping you moving, and on her need to pop, bounce and be all around bubbly throughout.  That said, Austin has tendency to command the routine as she is doing it and not a few steps ahead, as other trainers do.  If that type of instruction annoys you will be very frustrated with her style.All in all it's a fun DVD that will keep you moving.
