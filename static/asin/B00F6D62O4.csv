Smith ""smithb""","[12, 13]","In rebuttal to the earlier review, I am glad TGG chose to release season three even though they were unable to obtain the rights to the one episode. In my view, they tried based on the time that has passed between this and the other two releases. Better to have the quality prints of seasons three minus one episode than NO season three at all, at least in my book.Many of these small independents get compared to the unlimited resources of the big studio releases. TGG as a fairly new distributor has recently released titles the studios don't want to release themselves (or they would have chosen to and wouldn't have licensed them out) with quality prints and at dirt cheap pricing relatively speaking. I think they should be commended for their approach.As for the season three pricing, it is the same retail pricing as the previous two seasons. TGG doesn't dictate to Amazon how to discount it. The fact is that at this time Amazon is the only one listing it so they are leaving the price higher with a minimal discount. Once the listing shows up at others and the release date nears it will go down. I would be surprised if it is higher than $15 when finally released.",5,Thanks TGG for releasing season three,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,1174,"['rebuttal', 'earlier', 'review', 'am', 'glad', 'TGG', 'chose', 'release', 'season', 'three', 'even', 'were', 'unable', 'obtain', 'rights', 'one', 'episode', 'view', 'tried', 'based', 'time', 'passed', 'other', 'two', 'releases', 'Better', 'have', 'quality', 'prints', 'seasons', 'three', 'one', 'episode', 'NO', 'season', 'three', 'least', 'book.Many', 'small', 'independents', 'get', 'compared', 'unlimited', 'resources', 'big', 'studio', 'releases', 'TGG', 'fairly', 'new', 'distributor', 'recently', 'released', 'studios', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'licensed', 'out', 'quality', 'prints', 'dirt', 'cheap', 'pricing', 'relatively', 'speaking', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'approach.As', 'season', 'three', 'pricing', 'same', 'retail', 'pricing', 'previous', 'two', 'seasons', 'TGG', ""n't"", 'dictate', 'Amazon', 'how', 'discount', 'fact', 'time', 'Amazon', 'only', 'one', 'listing', 'are', 'leaving', 'price', 'higher', 'minimal', 'discount', 'listing', 'up', 'others', 'release', 'date', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'would', 'be', 'surprised', 'higher', '15', 'when', 'finally', 'released']",Bat Masterson Season 3

He wore a cane and a derby hat and was one of the best dressed lawmen to tame the Wild West in the 1880s.Roaming throughout the west he charmed the ladies, helped to right the wrongs of the unjustly accused, metered out the law to the lawless, in the progress made many friends and his enemies hated him with a vengeance.Now, in the Legend of the West, there stands a man above all the rest, the man who had the fastest gun, they called him Bat, Bat Masterson. With a gold-knobbed cane and his specially made six-shooter, his legend preceded him most of the time, and made many people cringe at the mere thought of his name.No western fan could possibly pass up the opportunity to own this exciting TV series that, with regret, lasted only three seasons.
