The weird characters and funny  stories made me enjoy this show growing up and I hope that my children can enjoy this series as much as i did growing up when they are born. Great addition to my collection. Add it to yours if you were a 90's kid like me and loved everything classic nickelodeon had to offer to us back then.,4,A piece of my childhood,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,397,"['love', 'collection', 'episodes', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'child', 'weird', 'characters', 'funny', 'stories', 'made', 'enjoy', 'show', 'growing', 'up', 'hope', 'children', 'can', 'enjoy', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'i', 'did', 'growing', 'up', 'when', 'are', 'born', 'Great', 'addition', 'collection', 'Add', 'yours', 'were', '90', 'kid', 'loved', 'everything', 'classic', 'nickelodeon', 'had', 'offer', 'back', 'then']",Aaahh!!!

If you're planning on getting season 4, make sure you check the price for this beforehand. The price for this could drop below 19.93 which is how much season 4 currently costs. If you don't want to wait for season 4, I'd suggest either waiting for this to go on sale and or selling your copies of seasons 1-3.Now as for the show itself, I haven't seen all the episodes of this show, but I've watched almost all of the season 2 episodes. While it's original, an original show doesn't automatically equal a good show. I thought that some parts were funny, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for a laugh per minute show. However, I think that most of the people that have seen this show would probably disagree with me. If you're still interested in seeing this show, I'd suggest checking out a few episodes before deciding whether or not to buy this.",3,"Season 4 will get a seperate release on 6/10, but only on shoutfactory.com",1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,978,"['stated', 'season', '4', 'will', 'be', 'shoutfactory.com', 'exclusive', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'will', 'sell', 'copies', 'here', 'amazon', ""'re"", 'planning', 'getting', 'season', '4', 'make', 'sure', 'check', 'price', 'beforehand', 'price', 'could', 'drop', '19.93', 'how', 'much', 'season', '4', 'currently', 'costs', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'wait', 'season', '4', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'either', 'waiting', 'go', 'sale', 'selling', 'copies', 'seasons', '1-3.Now', 'show', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'show', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'almost', 'season', '2', 'episodes', 'original', 'original', 'show', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'equal', 'good', 'show', 'thought', 'parts', 'were', 'funny', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'looking', 'laugh', 'minute', 'show', 'However', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'would', 'probably', 'disagree', ""'re"", 'still', 'interested', 'seeing', 'show', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'checking', 'out', 'few', 'episodes', 'deciding', 'not', 'buy']",Aaahh!!!

First, Rocko's Modern Life, then Angry Beavers, and now this, one of the classics from Klasky-Csupo's heydays.Truth be told, I almost forgot the show, only remembering bits and pieces from it, but I like the fact that I now have a collection of the series to watch at my discretion and catch up. And just like the other two DVD sets before, it's presented perfectly. A simple open and shut case, with a flipbook style presentation for each of the DVDs. And on the DVDs themselves, there were no annoying advertisements that plague so many DVDs nowadays. You know what I mean - you have to sift through several ads for upcoming movies before you can watch what you want, as if you're not paying for the DVD already. Shout Factory does not have this problem, and I am so grateful for it.As of this writing, I currently have all three DVD collections lined up on my shelf, eagerly awaiting the Danny Phantom Collection coming out in January.

1660120,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B00DOZNH58,Theo,"[17, 18]","This animated series from the mid nineties still stands as one of Nickelodeon's better efforts. It's not on the same level as the first season of Ren & Stimpy, but it's got nothing to be embarrassed about either.The basic premise of the show is that there's an entire secret underground of monsters who live to scare humans. The show is centred around a group of three young monsters at a live-in academy where they've been sent to learn this skill. If that sounds like a rather prosy premise (and let's face it - it is), this is a show that nevertheless manages to make it work: mainly by virtue of its own densely grunge aesthetic. It may not be Ren & Stimpy, but it ain't Harry Potter neither.For serious film and animation buffs, there's a lot take in. For example, in a recurring role as Simon The Monster Hunter, Jim Belushi reveals himself to be an extremely talented voice actor.  Tim Curry does the same in his role as the bug-like monster Zimbo.  For those more specifically interested in animation, Charlie Adler, arguably the pre-eminent voice actor of the era, appears in what is essentially the show's starring role as Ickis.Perhaps most interestingly, serious animation enthusiasts will notice a definite similarity in the music used in this series, and that of the adult animated series Aeon Flux. Not surprisingly, that's because the two share a common composer: Tim Blake. The unique sound he provides - a kind of absurdly operatic cacophony - contributes much to this show's twisted aesthetic.Like any cartoon from days gone by, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters will doubtless pick up a certain number of sales from pure nostalgia. Fair enough. But even from a strictly grown up perspective, it does have more going for it than that.It is a show you can watch for the first time as an adult, and still grow to love.Theo.",4,One of Nickelodeon's Better Efforts,1373932800,"07 16, 2013",2013,1829,"['animated', 'series', 'mid', 'nineties', 'still', 'one', 'Nickelodeon', 'better', 'efforts', 'not', 'same', 'level', 'first', 'season', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'got', 'nothing', 'be', 'embarrassed', 'either.The', 'basic', 'premise', 'show', 'entire', 'secret', 'underground', 'monsters', 'who', 'live', 'scare', 'humans', 'show', 'centred', 'group', 'three', 'young', 'monsters', 'live-in', 'academy', 'where', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sent', 'learn', 'skill', 'rather', 'prosy', 'premise', 'let', 'face', 'show', 'nevertheless', 'manages', 'make', 'work', 'mainly', 'virtue', 'own', 'densely', 'grunge', 'aesthetic', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Harry', 'Potter', 'neither.For', 'serious', 'film', 'animation', 'buffs', 'lot', 'take', 'example', 'recurring', 'role', 'Simon', 'Monster', 'Hunter', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'be', 'extremely', 'talented', 'voice', 'actor', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'same', 'role', 'bug-like', 'monster', 'Zimbo', 'more', 'specifically', 'interested', 'animation', 'Charlie', 'Adler', 'arguably', 'pre-eminent', 'voice', 'actor', 'era', 'what', 'essentially', 'show', 'starring', 'role', 'Ickis.Perhaps', 'most', 'interestingly', 'serious', 'animation', 'enthusiasts', 'will', 'notice', 'definite', 'similarity', 'music', 'used', 'series', 'adult', 'animated', 'series', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'two', 'share', 'common', 'composer', 'Tim', 'Blake', 'unique', 'sound', 'kind', 'absurdly', 'operatic', 'cacophony', 'contributes', 'much', 'show', 'twisted', 'cartoon', 'days', 'gone', 'Aaahh', 'Real', 'Monsters', 'will', 'doubtless', 'pick', 'up', 'certain', 'number', 'sales', 'pure', 'nostalgia', 'Fair', 'enough', 'even', 'strictly', 'grown', 'up', 'perspective', 'have', 'more', 'going', 'that.It', 'show', 'can', 'watch', 'first', 'time', 'adult', 'still', 'grow', 'love.Theo']",Aaahh!!!
