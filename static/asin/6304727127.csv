I had bought a set of this show on DVD's from someone who duped it from Nostlagia nd some Canadian netowrk and the quality was  between a 6 and 7 in quality for the most part.Now, it finally comes out on DVD two weeks ago and I have to agree with the other reviewers and say the quality is a little off. It is not what I expected, although it is watchable and not that bad.  It is about an 8.5.  We all thought it was going to be about a ten.Maybe there aren't available prints that are close to pristine quality, who knows.A bit of a letdown, but at least we have it out on disc now.",3,"NOT digital transfers, but pretty good, though disappointing.",1322697600,"12 1, 2011",2011,696,"['have', 'been', 'waiting', 'more', 'ten', 'years', 'series', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'had', 'bought', 'set', 'show', 'DVD', 'someone', 'who', 'duped', 'Nostlagia', 'Canadian', 'netowrk', 'quality', 'was', '6', '7', 'quality', 'most', 'part.Now', 'finally', 'out', 'DVD', 'two', 'weeks', 'ago', 'have', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'say', 'quality', 'little', 'off', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'watchable', 'not', 'bad', '8.5', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'ten.Maybe', 'are', ""n't"", 'available', 'prints', 'are', 'close', 'pristine', 'quality', 'who', 'knows.A', 'bit', 'letdown', 'least', 'have', 'out', 'disc', 'now']",It Takes a Thief Magnificent Thief  VHS

434287,A2F7CCPK4QL359,6304727127,"Bennet Pomerantz ""Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD""","[4, 8]","If you dont know the show It Takes a Thief..you should.This 18 disk, 66 episode set is over 5o hours of entertainment. It also has a reproduced 35mm  film cell (senitype) and four coaster set with a book with an essay regarding the show, The cell and the coasters as nice as they are are fluff for special collectors. the DVDs are real prize here . Who want the crackerjack prize when this show is a crackjack of a great television!This was Robert Wagner's first salvo into TV. Wagner embodied the chatacter of  Al Mundy. He  was cool, slick and hip. He ran with the jet set and the high rollers. He was a class act. He was Cary Grant, Burt Lancaster and Fred Astaire rolled into one man.On a personal note, this is one of my favorite TV classics along side MacGyver, The Man from UNCLE, Classic Star Trek and Blackadder. As good as this is, this show is a treasure for TV addicts everywhere. I am glad that Eone put this is one single collection unlike CBS who is drawing out the Perry Mason episodes on DVD.As the tag line says, the SIA (our government) hired (well springing him from Prison) Mundy to steal for the government of course. Some sort of state secret or safe he needed to crack. He ends up spying anyway!Malachi Throne plays the ""cop"" that busted Al, Noah Bain. Noah is his handler, never his friend. This odd couple relationship of boss and thief worked for the first two season. I wish it would have been working on the weakest season, the third (and final) season as well...Throne was not invited to be in the third season. I blame it on network and the producers trying to fix the show and move the locations to europe.One of the highlights of the third season was Al Mundy's father played by Fred Astaire. he was in only five episodes, dont miss those five. Season three boasted a guest cast of movie stars and famous  names as Bette (Madame Sin) Davis, Elsa Lanchester, Peter Sellers, Aldo {Thunderball} Celi, and Tom Smothers (in a racing episode) guest starred. The first two seasons guest cast was good, but not great! It has performers like Senta Berger, Sharon Acker, Joseph Cotton, Susan Saint James, Fernando Lamas, Gavin MacLeod (yes Before the Love Boat-he played villians and heavys) and Ricardo Montalban.Edward Binns took over for Throne in season three. He was not as hard nosed as Throne. He wavered a lot. It spoiled the interplay that Noah Bain has over Al.The story editor and producer for most of the series was Glen Larson. Yes, that is the same Glen Larson who created and produced such TV shows as  Knight Rider, Magnum PI, the classic Battlestar Galactica and The Fall Guy. His writing was created and inventive. His script  writing was over 19 shows, about a third of the series..but you can see his hand in other episodes.These 66 episodes are great entertainment.... the retro channel still runs these episodes, cut to ribbons with many many ads  on saturday night. Those great people at Eone who did a great job on theEllery Queen Mysteriesbox set has done it again. these episodes and the original pilot episode (Magnificent Thief) is restored to its orginal brillance. These disk  could be aired today the way these disk look today..the Masters are crisp and clear as any show from the late 1960 would be.Two great extras on this box set are the  great insightful interviews--one with Robert Wagner and the other with Glen Larson. Both reveal the personal side of the series. This is longest interview I have seen of Robert Wagner talking about Thief.So you better buy it now, ITS A STEAL!Bennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD",5,"AL, We're Not Asking to SPY...We're asking you to STEAL",1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,3564,"['dont', 'know', 'show', 'Thief..you', 'should.This', '18', 'disk', '66', 'episode', 'set', '5o', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'also', 'reproduced', '35mm', 'film', 'cell', 'senitype', 'four', 'coaster', 'set', 'book', 'essay', 'regarding', 'show', 'cell', 'coasters', 'as', 'nice', 'are', 'are', 'fluff', 'special', 'collectors', 'DVDs', 'are', 'real', 'prize', 'here', 'Who', 'want', 'crackerjack', 'prize', 'when', 'show', 'crackjack', 'great', 'television', 'was', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'first', 'salvo', 'TV', 'Wagner', 'embodied', 'chatacter', 'Al', 'Mundy', 'was', 'cool', 'slick', 'hip', 'ran', 'jet', 'set', 'high', 'rollers', 'was', 'class', 'act', 'was', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'rolled', 'one', 'man.On', 'personal', 'note', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'classics', 'side', 'MacGyver', 'Man', 'UNCLE', 'Classic', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Blackadder', 'As', 'good', 'show', 'treasure', 'TV', 'addicts', 'everywhere', 'am', 'glad', 'Eone', 'put', 'one', 'single', 'collection', 'CBS', 'who', 'drawing', 'out', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'DVD.As', 'tag', 'line', 'SIA', 'government', 'hired', 'well', 'springing', 'Prison', 'Mundy', 'steal', 'government', 'course', 'sort', 'state', 'secret', 'safe', 'needed', 'crack', 'up', 'spying', 'anyway', 'Malachi', 'Throne', 'cop', 'busted', 'Al', 'Noah', 'Bain', 'Noah', 'handler', 'never', 'friend', 'odd', 'couple', 'relationship', 'boss', 'thief', 'worked', 'first', 'two', 'season', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'working', 'weakest', 'season', 'third', 'final', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'Throne', 'was', 'not', 'invited', 'be', 'third', 'season', 'blame', 'network', 'producers', 'trying', 'fix', 'show', 'move', 'locations', 'europe.One', 'highlights', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'Al', 'Mundy', 'father', 'played', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'was', 'only', 'five', 'episodes', 'dont', 'miss', 'five', 'Season', 'three', 'boasted', 'guest', 'cast', 'movie', 'stars', 'famous', 'names', 'Bette', 'Madame', 'Sin', 'Davis', 'Elsa', 'Lanchester', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'Aldo', 'Thunderball', 'Celi', 'Tom', 'Smothers', 'racing', 'episode', 'guest', 'starred', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'guest', 'cast', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'performers', 'Senta', 'Berger', 'Sharon', 'Acker', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'Susan', 'Saint', 'James', 'Fernando', 'Lamas', 'Gavin', 'MacLeod', 'yes', 'Love', 'Boat-he', 'played', 'villians', 'heavys', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban.Edward', 'Binns', 'took', 'over', 'Throne', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'hard', 'nosed', 'Throne', 'wavered', 'lot', 'spoiled', 'interplay', 'Noah', 'Bain', 'over', 'Al.The', 'story', 'editor', 'producer', 'most', 'series', 'was', 'Glen', 'Larson', 'Yes', 'same', 'Glen', 'Larson', 'who', 'created', 'produced', 'such', 'TV', 'shows', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'Magnum', 'PI', 'classic', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Fall', 'Guy', 'writing', 'was', 'created', 'inventive', 'script', 'writing', 'was', '19', 'shows', 'third', 'series..but', 'can', 'see', 'hand', 'other', 'episodes.These', '66', 'episodes', 'are', 'great', 'entertainment', 'retro', 'channel', 'still', 'episodes', 'cut', 'ribbons', 'many', 'many', 'ads', 'saturday', 'night', 'great', 'people', 'Eone', 'who', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'theEllery', 'Queen', 'Mysteriesbox', 'set', 'done', 'again', 'episodes', 'original', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Magnificent', 'Thief', 'restored', 'orginal', 'brillance', 'disk', 'could', 'be', 'aired', 'today', 'way', 'disk', 'look', 'today..the', 'Masters', 'are', 'crisp', 'clear', 'show', 'late', '1960', 'would', 'be.Two', 'great', 'extras', 'box', 'set', 'are', 'great', 'insightful', 'interviews', 'one', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'other', 'Glen', 'Larson', 'reveal', 'personal', 'side', 'series', 'longest', 'interview', 'have', 'seen', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'talking', 'Thief.So', 'better', 'buy', 'now', 'ITS', 'A', 'STEAL', 'Bennet', 'PomerantzAUDIOWORLD']",It Takes a Thief Magnificent Thief  VHS

Robert Wagner, always one of the coolest actors in TV and film, played a top notch thief captured by the US government and forced to undertake missions of importance or go to prison.As opposed to White Collar, Alexander Mundy was mostly on his own once put into the field. He excelled at picking pockets, locks, safes, and the heartstrings of the women he ran into. One of his handlers biggest challenges was keeping female agents out of seduction's way. They never seemed to be working too hard themselves to avoid that fate! LOLThe plots and sets are a bit simple by today's standards, but stand up well enough, carried more than adequately by Robert Wagner's innate charm. Later in the series, Fred Astaire was added as his father, and those shows are also a lot of fun. The show was also marked by plenty of top guest stars from the selection of that time, including appearances by Susan St. James, John Saxon, Gavin McLeod, Anthony Zerbe, Tina Louise, James Shigeta, Robert Ito (later to star in Quincy) ... the list goes on and on.I've been waiting to be able to watch this series again for years, and it will be like seeing the episodes new, after forty years.

434290,A24NR9X60I4NQ7,6304727127,Brian Forrest,"[2, 4]","It Takes A Thief was one of the coolest TV shows in the sixties--it still is! Steve McQueen may be the King of Cool, but when you look up the definition of cool in the dictionary, Robert Wagner's picture should be there. Wagner plays Alexander Mundy, jewel thief extraordinaire with an eye for the ladies. Wagner brings vulnerability to the role and then adds his killer charm, that mixture of smooth, suave, sophisticated with just a dash of deadly when he needs it.Mundy is paroled/recruited by a secret U.S. intelligence organization (SIA) to pull off assignments that not even their best agents can. As Mundy's SIA boss Noah Bain, played by actor Malachi Throne, says ""Oh look Al, I'm not asking you to spy, I'm just asking you to steal."" Always under threat he will be sent back to prison if he doesn't take on each dangerous assignment and give it his all--Mundy does and the show modulates from sassy to sexy to scary as he is immersed in spy and counter-spy intrigues and impossible capers. As the under dog, under the SIA's thumb, Alexander Mundy proves he is top dog when it comes to out-witting the bad guys.The music theme (composed by Dave Grusin) and soundtrack is also the coolest: 60's cinema pop jazz.",5,The Definition of Cool,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",2011,1218,"['Thief', 'was', 'one', 'coolest', 'TV', 'shows', 'sixties', 'still', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'may', 'be', 'King', 'Cool', 'when', 'look', 'up', 'definition', 'cool', 'dictionary', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'picture', 'should', 'be', 'there', 'Wagner', 'Alexander', 'Mundy', 'jewel', 'thief', 'extraordinaire', 'eye', 'ladies', 'Wagner', 'vulnerability', 'role', 'then', 'killer', 'charm', 'mixture', 'smooth', 'suave', 'sophisticated', 'just', 'dash', 'deadly', 'when', 'it.Mundy', 'paroled/recruited', 'secret', 'U.S.', 'intelligence', 'organization', 'SIA', 'pull', 'off', 'assignments', 'not', 'even', 'best', 'agents', 'can', 'Mundy', 'SIA', 'boss', 'Noah', 'Bain', 'played', 'actor', 'Malachi', 'Throne', 'Oh', 'look', 'Al', ""'m"", 'not', 'asking', 'spy', ""'m"", 'just', 'asking', 'steal', 'threat', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'back', 'prison', ""n't"", 'take', 'dangerous', 'assignment', 'give', 'Mundy', 'show', 'sassy', 'sexy', 'scary', 'immersed', 'spy', 'counter-spy', 'intrigues', 'impossible', 'capers', 'dog', 'SIA', 'thumb', 'Alexander', 'Mundy', 'top', 'dog', 'when', 'out-witting', 'bad', 'guys.The', 'music', 'theme', 'composed', 'Dave', 'Grusin', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'coolest', '60', 'cinema', 'pop', 'jazz']",It Takes a Thief Magnificent Thief  VHS
434291,AI1QOZ8AMDR3Q,6304727127,Bruce Burke,"[1, 1]","This has finally arrived- and it's taken long enough of a wait to come out on DVD. One of the best original series ever done for TV with Robert Wagner  as Alexander Mundy , Malachi Throne as Noah Bain, and Fred Astaire as Alister Mundy in the 3rd Season. Many episodes are in very good to outstanding quality, but some you can tell are just from the last done remastering stage for the way they have been running on TV.  I remember this show when it was on ABC-TV in the '60's.  Especially 3rd season shows: It would not hurt to get some of the film work cleaned up like how film is fixed today to get rid of film flaws that has been done: Just like  the James Bond movies the films were all cleaned up by LOWERY.  Another big dissapointment is that I know they had  a long version play- along with a short version play of the main TV Credits for all 3 seasons.  The longer versions of  the series credits seasons 2 and 1 -there is not one show in this set from either seasons #one or #two that has one show displaying a long version season running credit sequence.  Season 3 : towards the later second half of season 3 does have  the long credits in maybe half a dozen episodes but only the credits for Season 3. This really made me dissapointed. In the long run, every episode is in this set and that in itself is worth it. Remastering many frame by frame and getting the longer credits out on a newer remastering set in the future I would recommend.

434293,AVQLXZ04FK0UV,6304727127,"Classic Movie Fan ""Classic Movie Fan""","[19, 23]","This is my edited review, having gone back and watched the set.If one can get past the costumes and hairdos of the women -- and the attitudes -- this is still a very watchable series.  The plots and writing are quite good.  It used a lot of well-known actors as guest starts when it was made.If you are younger and liked Leverage, then you may like this series.  Leverage was sort of a cross between the original Mission Impossible, which began in 1966, and It Takes a Thief, which started in 1968.  Leverage just added a lot of electronics, modern devices, and let the women actually be competent.These shows are like all the shows of their ilk, a caper must be performed, something goes wrong -- or does it? -- the characters complete the caper anyway.  Even though all of these shows and movies follow the same formula, what makes them watchable is how they are put together, acting, directing, writing, photography, sets, location scenes, etc.It Takes a Thief did it right, and it is still entertaining today.MISSING SCENES!!One problem, though.  The Eone people put the pilot on Disc 1 of this set in an edited format.  It runs about an hour and five minutes.  The complete pilot ""movie"" is available free on IMDB.com. It runs about 99 minutes.  If they were just trying to save disc space, why not just put the pilot on a separate disc and charge a couple dollars more?  If they didn't have a full print, then why bother to include it at all?  Or, why not obtain one?

Then we see Al trying to open a bunch of spears and riding to the top of a pavilion on a ""scoreboard"" like device.  Huh?

A fan since '70s reruns, I was quite curious to see how the picture quality here compared to over-the-air broadcasts, so much having been written in these reviews about faded color. Starting with the third season, where the problem was said to be the most noticable, I watched three episodes, marathon-style. And in every one, the colors were bold and bright, the picture definition as crisp as can be expected of any '60s era show. If anyone knows of episodes where the picture quality is especially bothersome, I'd like to have the titles, so I can compare them for myself.My only complaint is in the amount of flecks and debree sprinkled throughout each episode, but especially in the beginning minutes. These are obviously NOT digitally remastered. Still, we're getting ""It Takes a Thief"", complete and uncut, and as has been noted elsewhere, the sound quality is excellent. This is great for savoring what is surely one of the best TV theme songs of all time!As I've said over and over again in my other reviews, as well as in my comments, DO NOT watch these old '60s/'70s shows on large, flat screen hi-definition TVs. Unless they have been digitally remastered, there is not enough picture information, even in 35mm prints, to meet the demands of the newer sets. Instead, keep an older tube-style TV around, one with a screen size no greater than 19 inches. These are the kind of TVs that such old shows were intended to be viewed on, and will still deliver the best picture, all things considered.As for the packaging itself, I thought the outer box was ridiculously large for what it needed to hold, and would never fit in my jam-packed DVD shelves anyway. So out it went. The individual season packs are self-supporting enough to stand on their own without this additional bulk. The disks themselves are studio pressings, as opposed to burned in DVD-Rs, so problems with performance and longevity have been minimized. They are attractively labeled, with a listing for the episodes on each disk, thereby allowing easy referance. My only concern is that the protective cardboard jackets holding the disks have a coarse inner surface, which might lead to scratching. Insert or remove with care!And I think I'm the only one out there who actually LIKES the coasters. They are attractive, impervious to water damage, and are nice to have nearby, as I relax with a cold one in my hands, watching...What else?

The coolest burglar in TV or movie history is none other than Robert Wagner, as Alexander Mundy.Airing for 3 seasons from '68-'70, we got 66 episodes of espionage, heists, and of course, romance in exotic locales.  We got a cool theme song from Dave Grusin, spun over psychadelic opening montages, featuring 3 different opening tags through the three seasons.  In '68 you had Noah Bain, expertly played by Malachi Throne, uttering ""Look, Al, I'm not asking you to spy, I'm just asking you to steal.""  In '69 and into '70 it was Wagner responding with ""Let me get this straight, you WANT me to steal.""  And also in '70, there was none other than Alistair Mundy (Al's thief of a Dad) with ""I've heard of stealing from the government BUT FOR the goverment!""When Malachi Throne departed during the '69 season, he was replaced by Ed Binns as Wally Powers, who was never as strict as Noah.  Noah made Al stay in a government monitored house, under close wraps, but Al was quickly roaming free under Wally.  While the 3rd season was a whole lot of fun, featuring Fred Astaire as Al's Dad, the shows never had as much pinache as some of the superb 1st and 2nd season hits, and one of my favorite shows in TV history was canceled far too early.What made this show so grande was the performance of Robert Wagner, and the premise of the shows, where Al was sent in (almost always under an alias and spying in various disguises) to steal something, spy on someone, or protect something.  Who didn't want to emulate this globetrotting expert thief, who could steal things legally, sneak in and out of dangerous countries with the help of the US government, and seduce foreign diplomat's daughters.There were numerous classic episodes, often with lots of swinging 60's style and humor, but one very tense and dramatic story I remember was the two part Hans Across the Border, where Al had to smuggle a defector out of East Germany in a vehicle's hidden compartment.  Great stuff, but the shows with biting humor were the best, like the one where Al posed as a Magician with an assistant, or the one when he was a photographer during a United Nations beauty contest, in the aptly named episode 38-23-36.There wasn't a show as fun as this one, a leading man as suave as Al Mundy, or a premise as sweet as this.  It wasn't exactly a success at barely 3 seasons, but it should have gone on longer.  Many shows have tried to capture the thief gone good scenario, and until recently with the excellentWhite Collar, we had gone many years where carbon copies of this show have failed.***DVD Quality update***: Wow, I can't believe it's been 6 years since I initially wrote this, pining for a DVD release.  Now that it's finally out, many have complained of the picture quality.  Well, after finally getting my boxed set, I can honestly review the DVDs.  The clarity differs slightly with each episode you watch.  In some, there is a ton of graininess, and in others, the picture is clearer but the sharpness is low.  A few episodes have good picture quality and sharpness, however none are up to today's standards.  If you are a picky about image quality and like to watch everything in HD, this will be a strong disappointment to you.  However, if you are a fan of the show, and don't mind watching a lower quality picture, I don't think this becomes a deal breaker.  It is similar to watching a VHS quality tape, and for some episodes, it's like watching a 2nd generation VHS copy.  Hey, that's all we had back then and we still watched stuff, right?  It's up to you whether you think the price and quality are worth paying for, but I am glad to own the entire series.  It will stay in my collection and is still very watchable to me.Video Tip:  Change your TV setting from ""wide"" to ""normal"" when viewing It Takes A Thief, as it will zoom out the picture to it's normal ratio, rather than enlarging and stretching it to fit your screen.  This will give the episodes slightly better sharpness.",5,"Like Alexander Mundy, I'm in like flint; Mercedes limousine with the hardcore tint",1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,4169,"['so', 'Public', 'Enemy', 'rap', 'song', 'late', '80', 'ultra', 'chic', 'thief', 'late', '60', 'got', 'immortalized', 'vinyl', 'two', 'decades', 'later', 'should', 'continue', 'be', 'icon', 'decades', 'more', 'coolest', 'burglar', 'TV', 'movie', 'history', 'none', 'other', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'Alexander', 'Mundy.Airing', '3', 'seasons', ""'68-'70"", 'got', '66', 'episodes', 'espionage', 'heists', 'course', 'romance', 'exotic', 'locales', 'got', 'cool', 'theme', 'song', 'Dave', 'Grusin', 'spun', 'psychadelic', 'opening', 'montages', 'featuring', '3', 'different', 'opening', 'tags', 'three', 'seasons', ""'68"", 'had', 'Noah', 'Bain', 'expertly', 'played', 'Malachi', 'Throne', 'uttering', 'Look', 'Al', ""'m"", 'not', 'asking', 'spy', ""'m"", 'just', 'asking', 'steal', ""'69"", ""'70"", 'was', 'Wagner', 'responding', 'Let', 'get', 'straight', 'WANT', 'steal', 'also', ""'70"", 'was', 'none', 'other', 'Alistair', 'Mundy', 'Al', 'thief', 'Dad', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'stealing', 'government', 'BUT', 'goverment', 'When', 'Malachi', 'Throne', 'departed', ""'69"", 'season', 'was', 'replaced', 'Ed', 'Binns', 'Wally', 'Powers', 'who', 'was', 'never', 'as', 'strict', 'Noah', 'Noah', 'made', 'Al', 'stay', 'government', 'monitored', 'house', 'close', 'wraps', 'Al', 'was', 'quickly', 'roaming', 'free', 'Wally', '3rd', 'season', 'was', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'featuring', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Al', 'Dad', 'shows', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'pinache', 'superb', '1st', '2nd', 'season', 'hits', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows', 'TV', 'history', 'was', 'canceled', 'far', 'too', 'early.What', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'grande', 'was', 'performance', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'premise', 'shows', 'where', 'Al', 'was', 'sent', 'almost', 'always', 'alias', 'spying', 'various', 'disguises', 'steal', 'something', 'spy', 'someone', 'protect', 'something', 'Who', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'emulate', 'globetrotting', 'expert', 'thief', 'who', 'could', 'steal', 'things', 'legally', 'sneak', 'dangerous', 'countries', 'help', 'US', 'government', 'seduce', 'foreign', 'diplomat', 'daughters.There', 'were', 'numerous', 'classic', 'episodes', 'often', 'lots', 'swinging', '60', 'style', 'humor', 'one', 'very', 'tense', 'dramatic', 'story', 'remember', 'was', 'two', 'part', 'Hans', 'Border', 'where', 'Al', 'had', 'smuggle', 'defector', 'East', 'Germany', 'vehicle', 'hidden', 'compartment', 'Great', 'stuff', 'shows', 'biting', 'humor', 'were', 'best', 'one', 'where', 'Al', 'posed', 'Magician', 'assistant', 'one', 'when', 'was', 'photographer', 'United', 'Nations', 'beauty', 'contest', 'aptly', 'named', 'episode', '38-23-36.There', 'was', ""n't"", 'show', 'as', 'fun', 'one', 'leading', 'man', 'as', 'suave', 'Al', 'Mundy', 'premise', 'as', 'sweet', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'success', 'barely', '3', 'seasons', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'longer', 'Many', 'shows', 'have', 'tried', 'capture', 'thief', 'gone', 'good', 'scenario', 'recently', 'excellentWhite', 'Collar', 'had', 'gone', 'many', 'years', 'where', 'carbon', 'copies', 'show', 'have', 'failed', '***DVD', 'Quality', 'update***', 'Wow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'been', '6', 'years', 'initially', 'wrote', 'pining', 'DVD', 'release', 'Now', 'finally', 'out', 'many', 'have', 'complained', 'picture', 'quality', 'Well', 'finally', 'getting', 'boxed', 'set', 'can', 'honestly', 'review', 'DVDs', 'clarity', 'differs', 'slightly', 'episode', 'watch', 'ton', 'graininess', 'others', 'picture', 'clearer', 'sharpness', 'low', 'few', 'episodes', 'have', 'good', 'picture', 'quality', 'sharpness', 'however', 'none', 'are', 'up', 'today', 'standards', 'are', 'picky', 'image', 'quality', 'watch', 'everything', 'HD', 'will', 'be', 'strong', 'disappointment', 'However', 'are', 'fan', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'lower', 'quality', 'picture', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'deal', 'breaker', 'similar', 'watching', 'VHS', 'quality', 'tape', 'episodes', 'watching', '2nd', 'generation', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Hey', 'had', 'back', 'then', 'still', 'watched', 'stuff', 'right', 'up', 'think', 'price', 'quality', 'are', 'worth', 'paying', 'am', 'glad', 'own', 'entire', 'series', 'will', 'stay', 'collection', 'still', 'very', 'watchable', 'me.Video', 'Tip', 'Change', 'TV', 'setting', 'wide', 'normal', 'when', 'viewing', 'Thief', 'will', 'zoom', 'out', 'picture', 'normal', 'ratio', 'rather', 'enlarging', 'stretching', 'fit', 'screen', 'will', 'give', 'episodes', 'slightly', 'better', 'sharpness']",It Takes a Thief Magnificent Thief  VHS

I found more of the 1st season eps. to be of better quality in general. The ones that exhibited poor quality were of faded color and dirt with lines from the film transfer. There is also on the bad ones pixelation artifacting ... however I was surprised that the picture was very sharp where many poor transfers usually are blurry. It does not seem evident that these were re-mastered to restoration.. although they might have with some of the first season eps.? But It's like going through an old slide collection.. some of the ones the color fades others look better.. It is the case with this DVD box Set. I love the show and find the episodes watchable. Sure I would have preferred a pristine quality restored product.. but at least I can watch the show which I didn't get a chance to see all the episodes when they aired eons ago...  I have seen some really bad DVD transfers like Room 222 this set is way better in quality.

I personally recommend it. I am not crazy about the packaging.. the cardboard DVD inserts make it difficult to remove a disc without getting fingerprints on them.

434306,A3MQ3IIFGLQ2PO,6304727127,E. Hornaday,"[28, 34]","Fans are sure to rejoice with the news that the late 1960's iconic Classic TV series, It Takes a Thief, which starred Robert Wagner as the suave cat-burglar-turned-U.S.-secret-agent Alexander Mundy, will FINALLY be released on DVD in a complete series boxed set.The series was based on Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 Classic Film, ""To Catch a Thief,"" which starred the perfect cast of sophistication and beauty: Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. (FYI: The series was NOT based on the 1950's film, ""It Takes a Thief,"" as some websites have said.) The TV series title refers to the famous saying which was at the heart of the Grant-Kelly film: ""It Takes a Thief to Catch a Thief.""It Takes a Thief was a January replacement show for ABC, premiering Jan. 9, 1968, and running two-and-a-half seasons through March 23, 1970. It aired Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., E.S.T., and became a huge hit for the network, as well as propelling movie star Wagner into megastar status.E1 has said the 66 episodes that comprise the ENTIRE series, and are all included in this boxed set, have been remastered from original source material, and have promised a pristine transfer of the video and audio.Wagner's Mundy was a professional cat burglar of world renown who had style, class and talent. After many years of successful thievery, he was finally arrested and sentenced to a long term of incarceration inside the fictitious San Jobel Prison. Quite unexpectedly, he was contacted while in jail by a secret U.S. government spy agency called the ""S.I.A.""Mundy strikes a deal with American agent Noah Bain: A full pardon if Mundy uses his pilfering skills to steal for the American espionage agency. Technically under house arrest, Mundy travels all over the world performing daring acts of thievery in the name of Uncle Sam. He is closely monitored, especially by department director Bain, played to perfection by the fabulous and well-known Classic TV actor, Malachi Throne.Bain essentially acted as Mundy's boss, providing him with government assignments. As the series progressed, Bain evolved from a watchdog into an aide, associate, then close friend.Mundy traveled to exciting worldwide locales and had equally exciting adventures, while remaining under house confinement unless on the job. It wasn't until the second season that he was actually freed. The show was filmed in the glamorous world locales where Mundy plied his trade on behalf of Uncle Sam, adding authenticity and pizazz rarely seen on TV.In the final season of the show, Mundy occasionally enlisted the help of his fabulously charming, debonair, and equally light-fingered father, and mentor, Alistar Mundy, played unforgettably by the beyond-legendary Fred Astaire. Astaire's character's name employed a letter play on his real last name.In 1969, Bain was gone from the show, replaced by Agent Wally Powers, portrayed by Edward Binns.There were 66 episodes in all. Throne appeared in 42 episodes, 1968-1969; Binns appeared in, 10 episodes, 1969-1970; classic film star Joseph Cotten, portrayed Mr. Jack, for five episodes, 1968-1970; Astaire appeared in five Episodes, 1969-1970; and Susan St. James, in all of her wide-eyed glory, portrayed secretary-turned-sidekick Charlene ""Chuck"" Brown in five Episodes, 1968-1970.Viewers heard the following at the start of each episode:Noah's voiceover: ""We're not asking you to spy. We're just asking you to steal.""Alistar's voiceover: ""I've heard of stealing from the government, but for the government?""I will not bore readers here by listing the titles other than the first season's 16 episodes: A Thief is a Thief (a.k.a. Magnificent Thief); It Takes One to Know One; When Boy Meets Girl; A Very Warm Reception; One Illegal Angel; Totally By Design; When Thieves Fall In; A Spot of Trouble; When Good Friends Get Together; Birds of a Feather; To Steal a Battleship; Turnabout; The Radomir Miniature; Locked in the Cradle of the Keep; A Matter of Royal Larceny; and The Lay of the Land.Guest stars over the run of the series were the creame de la creame of that era's popular actors, including: Gavin MacLeod, Fernando Lamas, Sharon Acker, Don Knots, Stuart Margolin, Ricardo Montalban, Tina Sinatra, Peter Mark Richman, Barry Sullivan, Teri Garr, Georg Stanford Brown, Keye Luke, Wally Cox, Barry Williams, and Foster Brooks.",5,"It Takes E1 Studio to Finally, Finally, Catch This Thief!",1311292800,"07 22,

The first episode appears to be time compressed or has been taken off of a sped up PAL master.  Also that episode runs at just over an hour.  Has something been cut?  I couldn't tell as I haven't seen the show for many years, but it's odd that it would run just one hour and a minute long.  Also, no music over the end credits.  Very strange.  Image-wise, this episode doesn't look too bad, though it is a little soft looking.  Episodes 2-4 don't appear to be time compressed though episode 4 is taken off of a substandard video master that has a lot of ghosting in the image.  It's really tiring seeing some really great old television getting no respect on DVD.  CBS/Paramount will often provide great transfers for most of their shows, but some of these other labels are really slip-shod.  I wish Universal would quit farming out their shows to these low-grade producers and for once go back to the original film elements and provide first rate transfers.  Also, the packaging for IT TAKES A THIEF is really cheap and flimsy.  Standard DVD cases would have been preferable.

434315,A3160YSU1KRL8E,6304727127,Justin Playfair,"[2, 3]","This prototype pilot that staged the scenarios that would compose the famous mid 1960's television show was well written, filmed and acted. Originally entitled: ""Magnificent Thief"", Robert Wagner gave perhaps the best performance in what was to be his most well known and Emmy nominated role as expert in Theft, Alexander Mundy. The television series, which ran on Thursday nights, had a good time slot and continues to intrigue people even today due to excellent writing and actors who starred in the show. The character eventually extricates himself from the slavery of working for the Government due to the intervention of his father, Alastair Mundy, played by Sir fleet of foot, Fred Astaire. A total departure from what you would expect and it worked like a charm! Astaire was believable and both he and Wagner worked as if they were a real father/son franchise. Malachi Throne added his down to earth, serious personality to the role of Noah Baine and even after he left the series his ""presence"" remained. The show lasted a bit longer than the usual for programs of the era. It does reflect the 60's in Austin Powers fashion but it won't get in the way of holding your interest in the stories. Of course, this needs to be issued in DVD and I predict a considerable interest is out there that will buy it when it becomes a reality.",5,"""Let me get this straight..you want me to steal?""",1179532800,"05 19, 2007",2007,1337,"['prototype', 'pilot', 'staged', 'scenarios', 'would', 'compose', 'famous', 'mid', '1960', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'filmed', 'acted', 'Originally', 'entitled', 'Magnificent', 'Thief', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'gave', 'perhaps', 'best', 'performance', 'what', 'was', 'be', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'Emmy', 'nominated', 'role', 'expert', 'Theft', 'Alexander', 'Mundy', 'television', 'series', 'ran', 'Thursday', 'nights', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'slot', 'intrigue', 'people', 'even', 'today', 'due', 'excellent', 'writing', 'actors', 'who', 'starred', 'show', 'character', 'eventually', 'slavery', 'working', 'Government', 'due', 'intervention', 'father', 'Alastair', 'Mundy', 'played', 'Sir', 'fleet', 'foot', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'A', 'total', 'departure', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'worked', 'charm', 'Astaire', 'was', 'believable', 'Wagner', 'worked', 'were', 'real', 'father/son', 'franchise', 'Malachi', 'Throne', 'added', 'down', 'earth', 'serious', 'personality', 'role', 'Noah', 'Baine', 'even', 'left', 'series', 'presence', 'remained', 'show', 'lasted', 'bit', 'longer', 'usual', 'programs', 'era', 'reflect', '60', 'Austin', 'Powers', 'fashion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'holding', 'interest', 'stories', 'course', 'be', 'issued', 'DVD', 'predict', 'considerable', 'interest', 'out', 'there', 'will', 'buy', 'when', 'reality']",It Takes a Thief Magnificent Thief  VHS

You get the whole series every episode in on cool cube box set. Overall the packaging and the show is excellent. I have seen other reviews  here complaining about the quality of the shows but I have not found that to be true. It is true that this may not be a true frame by frame restoration of the show. But I have found every show to be crisp and clear with good sound quality. You might occasionally see a dirt spec or hair on the film from transfer but this all came from solid prints and the show holds up really well. If you want It Takes a Thief on DVD this is it!

434319,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,6304727127,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 11]","Series: 5 StarsPresentation: 3 StarsExtras: 4 starsFor three seasons from 1968 through 1970, Robert Wagner was the epitome of cheesy cool on ABC's breezy ""It Takes A Thief.""  There were a lot of spies to hit the airwaves within the decade of the sixties, and this was one of the last.  Blending comedy, action, and weekly romance--the 66 episodes were loaded with great guest stars, fun adventures, and even some legitimate suspense.  Wagner perfected this type of charming daredevil and he would certainly revisit it in his other roles, but this was always his greatest example of quintessential cool to my mind.  He was nominated for an Emmy and a Golden Globe in 1970.  It's hard to believe that ""It Takes A Thief"" has never had an official distribution for the home market, but that ends with this 18 disc Complete Series collection.  Those who are nostalgic for the show should relish being able to revisit the capers and those who just like classic TV in the lighthearted adventure mode should also be appreciative fans.Packaging:  The set comes in a fairly thin cardboard box.  While my set is perfectly intact, it's easy to imagine the flimsy material being harmed by improper handling.  While serviceable and attractive enough, I might have hoped for something a bit sturdier for the $200 manufacturer's suggested retail price point.  It's also of a relatively awkward size.  But that's really all just quibbling, for it's the contents that have got me all worked up.DVD Presentation:  The episodes themselves are said to have been digitally remastered.  It's a step up in crispness and clarity from the episode reruns that I've caught on TV, but it's hardly a revolutionary improvement.  It is the 1.33:1 ratio full frame presentation that you would expect with a mono soundtrack that is presentable if not spectacular.  Of course, the shows might not have the visual punch of something produced today (nor did I expect them to)--but I think they've done a good job cleaning the images up.  If you are expecting pristine prints, however, this may leave you a little disappointed.  Having the show available at all compensates, and this is undoubtedly as good as it is going to get.Extras:  The feature length version of the pilot episode is fun, and the set includes a reasonably insightful interview with Robert Wagner and another with writer/producer Glen A. Larson.  For those that like kitschy little collectibles, the box also has a limited edition senitype and a coaster set.  Both the coasters and senitype aren't particularly noteworthy, but I love this kind of stuff!  Never mind if everyone else thinks I'm crazy for getting excited about cheap cardboard coasters.  More interesting is the collectible booklet that has an essay which offers some insight and perspective into the show.Considering that ""It Takes A Thief"" has never been released before, this is a pretty decent (if not perfect) debut.In case, you have no idea what the show is about--Wagner plays a cat burglar (the set-up was inspired by Hitchcock's To Catch A Thief) who finances his upscale lifestyle through a bit of theft.  When he gets caught, however, this skill set is appropriated by a governmental agency who will pardon his crimes if he agrees to steal for good and patriotism.  So, you can kind of gauge the episode dynamics as Wagner incredulously starts an adventure with the immortal line ""Let me get this straight, you want me to steal?""  Wagner is the epitome of suave, and Malachi Thorne is a great boss/sidekick.  What's fun about watching classic TV, as well, is to see the roster of famous guest stars.  Here we get some very big names: Joseph Cotton, Fred Astaire, Fernando Lamas, Teri Garr, Ricardo Montalban among a load of other familiar faces.  One of the most memorable moments is the interracial romance with Marilyn McCoo, which was pretty risque for its day despite its contemporary chasteness.  If you like fun heist shows, ""It Takes A Thief"" is a great example.  And now, FINALLY, it's on DVD.

434324,A2P1951EAG7AZ4,6304727127,"M.B. ""Movie Collector""","[8, 10]","I just felt i had to defend The ""It Takes A Thief Box Set. Many reviewers are stating that the box set itself is badly or cheaply made. That statement is about 10% true. In my humble opinion, this is a very very nice box set. I literally have at least 30 various box sets, all with good, great, and bad designs. This one is a little on the weak side physically, but it is NOT cheaply made. Click on the picture, which allows you to zoom in on the set. Its got style, and is in a class all its own. Inside is the coaster set. Their nice cardboard coasters with very high quality print/Art work. Also within the set theres what looks like a piece of the film, Its about one inch by one inch, its mounted in a nice cardboard frame with similar artwork. And the booklet is printed in nice 4-color print. The artwork and colors are vivid. The box set looks excellent on display in my collection. Its stands right out from the rest. The discs are all in separate pre-cut sleeves within the fold out cardboard holders for each season. Lots of nice high quality pictures with-in the Disc holders. I could complain that each DVD slides into a cardboard slot, but the whole issue with this set is to just go slow, Its a very shiny, slippery type surface, and does not do any damage to the discs if you take your time and pay attention to what you are doing. And honestly, how many times do you think you will be removing each disc. Most people with a box set of this size will certainly watch the show, and maybe even succeed at watching every show. But my guess is that same disc might come out 5 times in your whole life. As for the picture quality. I personally cant say cause i haven't watched yet. Ill come back and write more on that after the fact. Most people in the Amazon Reviews seem to say that the first season looks great, the second season looks good, but that the third season doesn't look as good, but is definitely watchable. Since the show was made in the old days, its probably best to buy this on DVD and not Blu Ray. [If it ever does come out on Blu Ray]. Blu Ray might be too revealing of the films flaws. Even high def television are not ideal for a TV show from the 60s, [which seems to have got a little kicked around over the decades.] This probably looks perfect on a high quality Enhanced definition TV. Remember them? EDTV. I think its 420p. Perfect for this show. You cant beat the price right now either. Its really worth 100.00. To each his own, but its a nice set, and with a different frame of mind this can become your favorite new box set.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:to my original review.--------------------------Well I'm back, I scanned the first episode of each season. On season one, first episode, the mono sound was excellent and clear. The picture quality is a bit grainy ""but only in ""some"" of the darker scenes"". There was minor small specks of dirt spots and scratches flying by. The colors are proper and can be made more vivid with your TVs color button in settings. Daylight, and inside lit scenes look great. Season Two looked and sounded as good as season one. With season three the sound was as good as the other seasons. I noticed that the picture quality on season three was very passable and watchable. The difference with season three is that at the very beginning when the show first begins, there is more dirt specs and scratches than usual. It does clear up within 20 seconds or so. This season seems to have had less protection over the years but is still very watchable. You should also realize that this release marks the first time this show has ever been released on DVD. Usually this is the best you will see this because if it doesn't sell good than the rights will either go out of print or fall to a cheaper company that wont put the care into it that this company did. That happens a lot.

I've been watching the discs for a bit now although I haven't finished them, and found them to be very good quality for a show from the 1960s.They are a little bit odd on the extras - there is a disc with an interview with Robert Wagner and and interview with Glen Larson as well as an expanded version of the pilot ""Magnificent Thief"" all of which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The package came with a Senitype of Robert Wagner as Al Mundy which is a nice little collectors item and a set of coasters.  The coasters I didn't really understand - it was like they needed to throw something else in the package to make it marketable.  Personally I would have preferred more interviews and commentaries on the various episodes.  Oh well, that's just me.  There was also a booklet which had additional information on the show which I appreciated.  I guess the coaster was the only thing I found odd.There isn't much in the way of video noise or audio noise which I found refreshing.  It is a series from the 1960s so allowances are made.  The audio is mono and it looks like it was done in Technicolor, but I knew this going in since I watched the series when it aired in the 1960s.  I've been a fan of Robert Wagner for a long time, though haven't always appreciated all of his work.  This series does not disappoint.All in all it was a purchase that was well worth the money.  Speaking of which, I received a promotion in my email to get this series for a reduced price.  When I looked at the price online it was a little higher.  I contacted Amazon though and they credited the difference back to me.

Not unlike the old Mission Impossible series in feel and substance, with a new, seemingly impossible caper each week, set in a different exotic locale.  The premise is similar to the new series, White Collar, with Robert Wagner as the jewel theif-turned-government-agent, Al Mundy, who risks life and limb on behalf of a shadowy government agency.  Usually, Mundy has to find and steal (recover) a precious gem, a stolen document, an atomic bomb, or even a beautiful princess, all the while proving his worth and trying to find ways to keep his nervous, skeptical boss, Noah Bain, from sending him back to the slammer.  Bain, played by Malachi Throne, is a sheer delight to watch.  He's never really sure about Mundy's sincerity or devotion to Uncle Sam's cause.  As the series progresses, though, his &#34;admiration&#34; for Mundy's unique skills (as a thief and as a woman's man) grows, and the chemistry between the two is hard to miss.The third season was filmed entirely in Italy with Fred Astaire added to the cast as Al's father.  Most fans consider the third season the weakest of the three, but personally I thought some of the stories were extremely strong and well-thought out.It's a lot of fun - lots of familiar TV faces pop up looking so young.  Oh, the jazz score is snappy, too.

434332,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6304727127,Only-A-Child,"[4, 5]","""It Takes A Thief"" is a bit dated and probably only of interest to those who recall watching it years ago. The 1968-1970 ABC show was inspired by Cary Grant's debonair jewel thief in the film ""To Catch A Thief"".  Professional thief Alexander Mundy (Robert Wagner) gets an offer to work for the SIA (a covert U.S. government spy agency).  Mundy does not simply dismiss the offer out of hand as he is doing time and the government is offering him limited freedom (house arrest confinement in a Washington mansion between missions) in exchange for allowing them to utilize his considerable skills as a thief.While not on the level of classics like ""77 Sunset Strip"", the show's first two seasons followed the wonderful tradition of 1960's action/adventure/spy shows by casting a different hot ""young"" starlet in each episode (except episodes 1.12, 2.11, 2.12, 2.14 & 2.15).  The show went strangely gay for its third and ""final season"", replacing this practice with evocative shots of Robert Wagner and in the process losing its original audience.The set includes all 65 regular episodes and two versions of the pilot episode.  Despite complaints, the packaging I received was not bad, much better that the standard Mill Creek release.  Each season has its own folder with individual pockets for each disc. Although the flimsy square paper box that is the main package is completely useless.  Resolution is decent for the first two seasons, but since most older viewers first saw this as a grainy ABC broadcast, the resolution might cause an even more nostalgic reaction.The resolution is generally the worst on the Season Three episodes but those episodes were staggeringly moronic and completely lacking in eye candy, so the poor film stock or generational video dubbing did not ruin anything of any quality.  The third season episodes are bad but not bad enough to work as mockfest material. Watch for the steady parade of ancient actresses with mega makeup, perhaps they provided the financing to keep things going for another week in exchange for the opportunity to take a working vacation at some exotic foreign location and a chance to encourage Wagner to unbutton his shirt a bit more.  Fortunately the first two seasons provide enough entertainment to justify the price, even if you simply trash the third season.DVD set extras are a booklet, a 4-piece coaster set (why?) and interviews with Robert Wagner (he is not asked if he killed Natalie) and with Glen Larson.  Larson was associated with the series for its entire run, mostly as an associate producer but occasionally as a writer, particularly during season three.  In fact, when you find a particular episode especially boring it is a fair bet that it is one that Larson wrote.  It is believed that he was the Coen Brothers' model for the Digby Sellers character in ""The Big Lebowski"".Then again, what do I know?

As an earlier reviewer commented ITAF was like the American version of The Saint. The show was smart,plots are always complex requiring Mundy's specialty - to steal something or someone. As always the humor was the most important part of the show. The show became much darker in its last season. The loss of Noah Bain was a big part of it,the interplay between Mundy & Bain was essential to the show. This show is better than the 2 later series Wagner appear in (Switch & Hart to Hart).

Using his skills as a thief and con man, Mundy travels the world as a spy (and thief) for the US government.Inspired by Hitchcock's  Cary Grant film, To Catch a Thief, this popular television series lasted two-and-a-half seasons in the late 60's.  Starring Robert Wagner as Alexander Mundy, It Takes a Thief was a Bond-like adventure/spy series with plenty of mystery, intrigue, humor, and romance. Multiple guest star appearances by many familiar faces such as Fred Astaire, Susan Saint James, and Ricardo Montalban and more add to the sense of nostalgia and fun. The complete series is now available in a collectible box, containing all 66 episodes on 18 discs, the extended version of the pilot film, interviews, and more.I was not around for the original airing of the series, but found the show charming and Robert Wagner as irresistible as ever. As a fan of the early Bond films, I couldn't help but compare, and was hooked from the pilot.  USA Network's White Collar obviously borrowed heavily from this series, though adapted for today's world. It Takes a Thief is a fantastic look back at the 60s espionage/adventure days with a young and dashing Robert Wagner.DVD Set Includes:*  All 66 Episodes Digitally Re-Mastered*  Extended Feature-Length Version of the Pilot Episode*  The King of Thieves: Interview with Robert Wagner*  A Matter of Larceny: Interview with Glen A.

434345,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,6304727127,trebe,"[2, 2]","With Robert Wagner (Hart to Hart, Switch) starring as master thief Alexander Mundy, the action/adventure series It Takes a Thief (1968-70), ran for three seasons on ABC.  Created by Roland Kibbe, the program was a midseason replacement that premiered in January of 1968, and produced a total of 66 episodes.  Hitchcock's classic thriller,To Catch a Thief(1955), supposedly provided the inspiration for Al Mundy, a cool, classy, and handsome gentleman crook and cat burglar.Al Mundy is doing time in prison, when Noah Bain (Malachi Throne) of the SIA (Secret Intelligence Agency), a branch of US intelligence, springs him from behind bars, and presents him with a unique proposition.  In return for his parole, Mundy agrees to carry out missions for the SIA, utilizing his singular talents as a con artist, and master thief.  Initially, Mundy is placed under house arrest in a residence near Washington D.C., where he is watched on closed circuit TV, and supervised by various female SIA agents.  However, by the second season, Al had earned enough points to live on his own, unsupervised.The premise of a man living in a gilded cage, while being forced to steal and engage in espionage, to preserve his freedom, is remarkably intriguing.  More so, because Al Mundy not a trained operative, and doesn't like guns or violence.  Appearing at the tail end of the ""spy craze"", following in the wake of programs like Mission Impossible, and The Man From U.N.C.L.E., audiences were very familiar with kinds of stories presented on It Takes a Thief.  The big differences were that rather than a team or organization, the focus was mostly on just one man, and the series brings a comedic spin, to what are supposedly deadly serious missions.Mundy's semi-adversarial relationship with Noah Bain, is also a key element in the series' appeal.  Constantly putting Al in danger, spoiling his fun, and threatening to send him back to prison, Malachi Throne adroitly plays a character that is sometimes hard to like.From the start, realism was not a major concern, as the dashing charismatic Mundy operated with daring and style, in the face of great danger, though at times obviously trying much too hard to be cool.  Chaffing against the leash of his SIA handlers, while charming many a lovely young woman, Mundy assumes a multitude of roles, often involving impersonations, disguises, exaggerated accents, and inappropriate ""hipster"" lingo.  Gadgetry occasionally plays a role, but Mundy generally relies on his own unique skills to stay alive.Generally featuring outlandish plots, and often set in fictional foreign lands, the series was shot on location, and also on the expansive Universal Studios lot.  The third season brought some major changes, as the production moved to Europe, and contractual issues led to Malachi Throne's departure.  The jet setting Mundy was now fully committed to the SIA, and was operating like a James Bond clone.  The loss of Throne was somewhat offset by the addition of the legendary Fred Astaire (1899-1987), in the reoccurring role of Mundy's father Alistair, another master thief.  After Throne's departure, Edward Binns most often assumed the role of Mundy's SIA contact.The series featured an outstanding lineup of guest stars, including a continuous string of beautiful women.  It's tough for Al to get romantic with Bain and his SIA staff around, but when operating in the field, Mundy has more opportunities to employ his effusive charms.  Things rarely go smoothly, as there is usually a bit of friction between Al and his female partners, which typically makes for some spirited and entertaining adventures.The series' musical theme by Dave Grusin is brilliant, and the show's musical score is lively and fun, and hopefully will be made available someday.  The eighteen disc set contains 66 episodes, plus the extended 89 minute version of the pilot, ""Magnificent Thief"".  Also included are interviews with Robert Wagner, and producer Glen A. Larson. Image quality of the series varies quite a bit.  Sometimes the show looks great, with good sharpness and color saturation, and other times the colors appear washed out, or shows signs of grain, or loss of sharpness.  The variable quality, is why this release rates 4.5 stars, rather than a full on 5 stars.The set also includes a collectible film cell, and strangely, a set of unimpressive looking coasters.  The individual seasons are housed in separate fold out cardboard sleeve type cases.  The packaging leaves something to be desired, as the contents are housed in a flimsy oversized cardboard box.While it has serious aspects, It Takes A Thief also has a lighter side, that makes for a change of pace from other series involving spies and espionage.  Al Mundy is an intriguing and extremely likeable character, and Roger Wagner is provided the opportunity to showcase his talents, working with a fabulous guest cast, in this lively classic 60's

434346,AQP1VPK16SVWM,6304727127,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[5, 5]","A classic TV series that saw considerable syndication that was probably more successful than its original run ""It Takes a Thief"" Robert Wagner's TV series finally arrives on DVD in a set that includes the complete original run series.Wagner plays talented thief Alexander Mundy sprung from prison (sound familiar to you fans of ""White Collar""?) by government agent Noah Bain (the marvelous Malachi Throne)to ""steal"" things for the Secret Intelligence Agency.Featuring some terrific guest stars including the late Fred Astaire as Mundy's father (and a final season with episodes shot on location in Europe), the series was a popular fixture on ABC and although it was never a huge hit for the network the appeal of Wagner, the often breezy scripts and top notch acting helped keep the series on air. Wagner and Throne had great onscreen chemistry and when Throne left the series the show suffered for it.Entertainment One has done a nice job with the series. Although remastered the series doesn't look quite as good as other vintage TV shows but still beats many of the others that have arrived on DVD. Colors look pretty good overall although they aren't quite as bold and detail isn't quite as strong as I had hoped. It's possible this may be an older transfer prepared for the Hulu and other online viewing so, perhaps, a stronger restoration attempt wasn't made here. Either way, fans will be satisfied for the most part with the look of the show as they are largely clean, clear and have nice color.As far as I can tell these are the uncut nonsyndicated version of the series including the restored pilot episode (which wasn't initially syndicated as I recall).The original mono audio appears (on first viewing) unaltered but I don't have the original to syndicated version to compare it with.Although I could have done without the collectable box along with a senitype, a 35mm frame featuring Wagner's image. I really didn't need the set of four drink coasters although the full-color booklet with the informative essay by Dean Brierly is much appreciated. The packaging includes information on the original air dates for the episodesWe get ""The King of Thieves"" a 30 minute interview with star Wagner about the series as well as a 30 minute interview with writer/producer Glen A. Larson who worked on the series under the clever punning title ""A Matter of Larceny"".The pilot is presented in its longer theatrical running time (it was released theatrically in Europe)and we also get the original U.S. TV version (which runs over 20 minutes less). The stylish direction by Leslie Stevens (""The Outer Limits"" and TV's  ""Buck Rogers"")along with the script make the pilot movie and its expanded version a big plus for this set.Although the writing on some episodes hasn't aged quite as well as I'd hoped, the show still remains delightfully fun to watch even in these instances due to Wagner's breezy appealing performance and Throne's marvelous performance as Bain. The image quality isn't perfect but this is probably about the best the show has looked without a full restoration.For fans of the series this is recommended.",4,"You'll want your time ""stolen"" away with this reissue of classic series",1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,3127,"['classic', 'TV', 'series', 'saw', 'considerable', 'syndication', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'successful', 'original', 'run', 'Thief', 'Robert', 'Wagner', 'TV', 'series', 'finally', 'DVD', 'set', 'complete', 'original', 'run', 'series.Wagner', 'plays', 'talented', 'thief', 'Alexander', 'Mundy', 'sprung', 'prison', 'sound', 'familiar', 'fans', 'White', 'Collar', 'government', 'agent', 'Noah', 'Bain', 'marvelous', 'Malachi', 'Throne', 'steal', 'things', 'Secret', 'Intelligence', 'Agency.Featuring', 'terrific', 'guest', 'stars', 'including', 'late', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Mundy', 'father', 'final', 'season', 'episodes', 'shot', 'location', 'Europe', 'series', 'was', 'popular', 'fixture', 'ABC', 'was', 'never', 'huge', 'hit', 'network', 'appeal', 'Wagner', 'often', 'breezy', 'scripts', 'top', 'notch', 'acting', 'helped', 'keep', 'series', 'air', 'Wagner', 'Throne', 'had', 'great', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'when', 'Throne', 'left', 'series', 'show', 'suffered', 'it.Entertainment', 'One', 'done', 'nice', 'job', 'series', 'remastered', 'series', ""n't"", 'look', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'vintage', 'TV', 'shows', 'still', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'arrived', 'DVD', 'Colors', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'overall', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bold', 'detail', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'strong', 'had', 'hoped', 'possible', 'may', 'be', 'older', 'transfer', 'prepared', 'Hulu', 'other', 'online', 'viewing', 'so', 'perhaps', 'stronger', 'restoration', 'attempt', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'here', 'way', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'satisfied', 'most', 'part', 'look', 'show', 'are', 'largely', 'clean', 'clear', 'have', 'nice', 'color.As', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'are', 'uncut', 'nonsyndicated', 'version', 'series', 'including', 'restored', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', ""n't"", 'initially', 'syndicated', 'recall', '.The', 'original', 'mono', 'audio', 'first', 'viewing', 'unaltered', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'original', 'syndicated', 'version', 'compare', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'collectable', 'box', 'senitype', '35mm', 'frame', 'featuring', 'Wagner', 'image', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'set', 'four', 'drink', 'coasters', 'full-color', 'booklet', 'informative', 'essay', 'Dean', 'Brierly', 'much', 'appreciated', 'packaging', 'information', 'original', 'air', 'dates', 'episodesWe', 'get', 'King', 'Thieves', '30', 'minute', 'interview', 'star', 'Wagner', 'series', 'as', 'well', '30', 'minute', 'interview', 'writer/producer', 'Glen', 'A.', 'Larson', 'who', 'worked', 'series', 'clever', 'punning', 'title', 'Matter', 'Larceny', '.The', 'pilot', 'presented', 'longer', 'theatrical', 'running', 'time', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically', 'Europe', 'also', 'get', 'original', 'U.S.', 'TV', 'version', '20', 'minutes', 'less', 'stylish', 'direction', 'Leslie', 'Stevens', 'Outer', 'Limits', 'TV', 'Buck', 'Rogers', 'script', 'make', 'pilot', 'movie', 'expanded', 'version', 'big', 'plus', 'writing', 'episodes', ""n't"", 'aged', 'quite', 'as', 'well', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'show', 'still', 'delightfully', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'instances', 'due', 'Wagner', 'breezy', 'appealing', 'performance', 'Throne', 'marvelous', 'performance', 'Bain', 'image', 'quality', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'probably', 'best', 'show', 'looked', 'full', 'restoration.For', 'fans', 'series', 'recommended']",It Takes a Thief Magnificent Thief  VHS

434348,A2YSUIVL0J16IX,6304727127,"William S. Lloyd ""Count Iblis""","[1, 1]","One of the more 'fun' spy shows of the 60's chock full of those old school T.V. show qwerks like making up names of countries that do not exist etc. Who other than Robert Wagner could have played the smooth talking, dashing and resourceful Al Mundy? Armed only with his wits and a custom made velvet lined cigarette case holding all his lock picks Al is recruited, while in prison, by the government to work as a 'specialist' for them, but as Malachi Throne says in the title credits ""I'm not asking you to spy, I'm just asking you to steal."" The series was kicked off with a pretty good made for T.V. movie pilot called Magnificent Thief which obviously had a good size budget for the times. Although the three young ladies assigned to watch Al while he is in 'government' custody did not roll over into the series Al still gets plenty of play with the ladies. One of the things I really like about Wagner's character of Mundy is that he is absolutely fallable, but somehow finds a way around problems he faces so as to get the job done proving he is more than just a B&E man. A great series and a great time period to look back on before there were household computers, cell phones etc. and see how in the pre-digital world it took a man with real wits, creativity and exotic tools to get the job done.",5,Magnificent!
