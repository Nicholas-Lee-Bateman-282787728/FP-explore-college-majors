1691858,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00HRYH52I,C. Sawin,"[2, 2]","&#34;Confession of Murder&#34; has a fantastically gripping opening. We see Choi sitting at a restaurant while it pours down rain as he remembers his pursuit of the killer. The camera does some pretty incredible stuff perspective-wise during this foot chase. Like the camera work in &#34;The Raid 2,&#34; the camera seems to contort itself to allow full use of dynamic angles while following these two characters. The camera slides underneath a car at one point and even seems to smash through a window as the killer jumps out of one to escape the clutches of a determined Lieutenant Choi.But the excellent beginning only strengthens the South Korean action thriller's slow but steady building decline. The main storyline of the film is riveting, but there's this entire secondary storyline that nearly ruins everything the film has going for it. Comedy and goofy behavior has no place in a film like this, but writer/director Jung Byung-gil forcefully stuffs as much unwanted absurdity as he can into the film.A group of the killer's victim's relatives and loved ones gather and pursue a fresh-out-of-prison private investigator to gain revenge on Lee Doo-suk, but unfortunately this ragtag faction of over trained nincompoops only muck up Detective Choi's investigation. Look no further than the unrealistic car chase in the middle of the film which features balancing on the roofs and hoods of multiple cars and hospital gurneys all while barreling down a highway. The blatant green screen shots are beyond preposterous as are the ludicrous actions of a certain knife wielding private dick.&#34;Confession of Murder&#34; has a captivating primary storyline with superb performances from the short-tempered Jung Jae-young and the overconfident Park Si-hoo. However the film seems to run about 30-40 minutes too long while the side plot is overly goofy when it has no reason to be. With dark, compelling components similar to that of &#34;The Chaser&#34; and &#34;Memories of Murder,&#34; &#34;Confession of Murder&#34; feels like a great film wrapped inside of a dreadful one that suffers from disastrous editing and shoddy writing.",3,Cataclysmically appealing,1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,2134,"['34', 'Confession', 'Murder', '34', 'fantastically', 'gripping', 'opening', 'see', 'Choi', 'sitting', 'restaurant', 'down', 'rain', 'pursuit', 'killer', 'camera', 'pretty', 'incredible', 'stuff', 'perspective-wise', 'foot', 'chase', 'camera', 'work', '34', 'Raid', '2', '34', 'camera', 'contort', 'allow', 'full', 'use', 'dynamic', 'angles', 'following', 'two', 'characters', 'camera', 'car', 'one', 'point', 'even', 'smash', 'window', 'killer', 'one', 'escape', 'clutches', 'determined', 'Lieutenant', 'Choi.But', 'excellent', 'beginning', 'only', 'South', 'Korean', 'action', 'thriller', 'slow', 'steady', 'building', 'decline', 'main', 'storyline', 'film', 'riveting', 'entire', 'secondary', 'storyline', 'nearly', 'everything', 'film', 'going', 'Comedy', 'goofy', 'behavior', 'place', 'film', 'writer/director', 'Jung', 'Byung-gil', 'forcefully', 'as', 'much', 'unwanted', 'absurdity', 'can', 'film.A', 'group', 'killer', 'victim', 'relatives', 'loved', 'ones', 'gather', 'pursue', 'fresh-out-of-prison', 'private', 'investigator', 'gain', 'revenge', 'Lee', 'Doo-suk', 'unfortunately', 'ragtag', 'faction', 'trained', 'nincompoops', 'only', 'muck', 'up', 'Detective', 'Choi', 'investigation', 'Look', 'further', 'unrealistic', 'car', 'chase', 'middle', 'film', 'balancing', 'roofs', 'hoods', 'multiple', 'cars', 'hospital', 'gurneys', 'barreling', 'down', 'highway', 'blatant', 'green', 'screen', 'shots', 'are', 'preposterous', 'are', 'ludicrous', 'actions', 'certain', 'knife', 'wielding', 'private', 'dick.', '34', 'Confession', 'Murder', '34', 'captivating', 'primary', 'storyline', 'superb', 'performances', 'short-tempered', 'Jung', 'Jae-young', 'overconfident', 'Park', 'Si-hoo', 'However', 'film', 'run', '30-40', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'side', 'plot', 'overly', 'goofy', 'when', 'reason', 'be', 'dark', 'compelling', 'components', 'similar', '34', 'Chaser', '34', '34', 'Memories', 'Murder', '34', '34', 'Confession', 'Murder', '34', 'feels', 'great', 'film', 'wrapped', 'dreadful', 'one', 'disastrous', 'editing', 'shoddy', 'writing']",N/A

Briggs ""MusicDr""","[0, 0]","Please understand that my wife and I have been dedicated Park Si Hoo fans for years, but we also must be objective on evaluations such as this.  The plot of the film and the surprising climax were both excellent, and for the most part the acting was unexpectedly good.  However, the film was somewhat sabotaged by the director, a former stuntman for other films.  One result was an over-the-top array of totally unnecessary chase scenes and related actions that did not really contribute anything to the story line, much less have much to do with focus of the mystery.  Additionally, the Korean penchant for filming summer and spring scenes in the dead of winter must have been brutal on the actors. And for part of the scenes being filmed in a huge mansion owned by a wealthy character - who apparently was too poor to turn on the heat and to film a crucial scene featuring Park Si Hoo in a swimming pool - again in the dead of winter in Korea - were unnecessary, as attested to by seeing these peoples' breaths in summer and spring!

1691860,AYG1U47VFZ165,B00HRYH52I,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[9, 9]","I've been enjoying films out of South Korean for going on two decades now.  That isn't to say that I've enjoyed everything that's come out of that great nation; it is to say, however, that I'm far more interested in even their small releases than I am most American-made summer blockbusters.  I've said it before, but I'll repeat it in the event that you're just finding my critical voice now: an awful lot of these foreign releases aren't shackled by the studio-enforced creative constraints killing much of the U.S. theatrical scene, and that's a huge benefit.However, CONFESSION OF MURDER tries to blend those two worlds - create a summer tent-pole-style flick that'll bring in the masses while preserving that which makes Korean cinema its own animal.  It succeeds more than it fails, but where it fails it almost veers into cartoon silliness, most of which is limited to the film's big action sequences.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you're the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)After the statute of limitations expires on a particular grisly series of serial murders, a picture perfect young man named Lee (played by Park Shi Hoo) comes forward claiming to have committed all of them except a last one long attributed to the same killer.  As his penance, he's chosen to release his memoirs - detailing the highs and lows of these events - as well as make a public apology to the families.  Still, Detective Choi (Jae-yeong Jeong) isn't convinced of the man's sincerely, and he'll find himself caught up in a dangerous game to unmask the real culprit despite the fact that, legally, there may be nothing that can be done about it.As is often the case when I critique foreign films, I have some quibbles with some of the artistic choices, but rarely have I see a motion picture try as hard as CONFESSION OF MURDER.  In fact, on first blush I'm almost willing to give director Jung Byung-gil a pass on a few of them.  Despite what some others have written and perhaps a high score here and elsewhere, MURDER isn't perfect; it nearly spirals out of control with some increasingly bizarre action set pieces that strive for overkill when modesty would've definitely been the better choice.At the core of the experience is a nonetheless stellar whodunit.  Precisely because there's seemingly very little that can be done if Lee's guilt is established is the driving force around so very much of this story, and, on most levels, that's pretty thrilling.  Throwing in the chief detective who has lived a life largely in personal frustration and professional disgrace for letting this one get away (it happens to involve the death of his fianc&eacute;) truly propels the pulse to a frenetic rate.  Won-yeong Choi and Jae-yeong Jeong are particularly effective playing against one another - one is young and virile, while the elder appears ragged and scarred (internally and externally).  Their chemistry as adversaries struggling to regain what they've lost makes MURDER definitely worth the effort.  I won't spoil the big finish, but I will say that the flick definitely will keep you guessing with some solid, effective developments.What grinds the film to a halt are two action pieces that start small but build to almost the point of absurdity.  Again, I'll avoid spoiling it, though I'm willing to say that they're obviously highly accomplished stunt work - mostly practical stuff, very little CGI (thankfully); it's just that, on the narrative level, these sequences rise to the level of an Indiana Jones motion picture, and that felt largely out-of-sync with the honest, guttural, and emotional narrative established by the story.  This isn't to say that they're bad choices; rather, it's just that they're bad choices as constructed, feeling like their antics belong in some other picture centered on action heroes instead of players caught up in a brainy cat-and-mouse potboiler.Definitely worth the time, MURDER goes on a bit long.  I would've trimmed some of the lunacy of a few car chases, and this one could've been one for the ages.CONFESSION OF MURDER (2012) is produced by Dasepo Club in association with Showbox / Mediaplex.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled through the stellar and reliable Well Go USA Entertainment.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Korean spoken language release with English subtitles available.  (There is no English-dubbed track.)  As for the technical specifications, these days you can take almost any of Well Go USA's Korean releases to the bank; they're only serving up the highest quality sights and sounds imaginable.  Lastly, if it's special features you're most interested in, well, you'll likely be disappointing: there's a brief behind-the-scenes short along with equally short interviews with a few key players, but that's all you get.RECOMMENDED.  Look, I'll probably not be the first to point out that CONFESSION OF MURDER isn't perfect; I suspect I won't be the last either.  As hard as the story tries to serve up one twist after another, you'd think someone was giving out awards for plot surprises.  Sadly, that's not the way award ceremonies work, and I tend to think a healthy dialing back on the last few big reveals might've helped make this whodunit a tad more believable.  However, its action sequence are all solid, if not a bit overreaching as well.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of CONFESSION OF MURDER by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,"CONFESSION OF MURDER Becomes ""Confusion Over Directorial Choices""",1396828800,"04 7,

A serial killer is on the loose and is being stalked by a police officer.  There is a confrontation that doesn't end well for the officer.  Years later, the serial killer writes a book confessing to all the murders.  He does this because there is a statute of limitations for his crimes.  Women and the media are entranced by the good looking killer.  The officer wants justice. Or is it revenge? The families of the victims want revenge and plot to kidnap the killer.  But then there's another twist during a televised debate where a third party comes forward to threaten the claims of the killer.  There is a great ambulance chase scene, great acting, and a great plot twist. I'd love to see someone do an American version, but I don't know how they'd get around the obvious roadblocks in our justice system.

The director and screenwriters had a great idea for a movie, but should have stuck with one genre, and not jump from strong-thriller, to stunt-action, to comedy, and back to drama-thriller.  A best description of this movie would be a combination of movie plots from Chaser (2008), Wheels on Meals (1984), and I Saw the Devil (2010) with a James Bond action undertone, and Shakespearean ending. Confession of Murder (2012) falls in its own movie category just like The Cabin in the Woods (2012). This movie begs to be re-directed.  Solid 3 stars that is all it deserves. If you have nothing to do and nothing to watch...but why waste time on this film if one can see Memories of Murder (2003) which is much more of a cohesive and interesting Korean thriller.",3,So much potential...wasted.,1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,934,"['one', 'movies', 'were', 'plot', 'really', 'intriguing', 'twists', 'turns', 'together', 'unrealistic', 'almost', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'make', 'movie', 'lose', 'appeal', 'director', 'screenwriters', 'had', 'great', 'idea', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'one', 'genre', 'not', 'jump', 'strong-thriller', 'stunt-action', 'comedy', 'back', 'drama-thriller', 'best', 'description', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'combination', 'movie', 'plots', 'Chaser', '2008', 'Wheels', 'Meals', '1984', 'Saw', 'Devil', '2010', 'James', 'Bond', 'action', 'undertone', 'Shakespearean', 'ending', 'Confession', 'Murder', '2012', 'own', 'movie', 'category', 'just', 'Cabin', 'Woods', '2012', 'movie', 'be', 're-directed', 'Solid', '3', 'stars', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'nothing', 'watch', 'why', 'waste', 'time', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'Memories', 'Murder', '2003', 'much', 'more', 'cohesive', 'interesting', 'Korean', 'thriller']",N/A

The only things I didn&#8217;t like were some the totally unbelievable action scenes.  The special effects were obviously FAKE&#8230;like the first time we see the girl with the crossbow &#8211; REALLY LOOKED FAKE and totally unbelievable.  The ambulance chase scene looked really FAKE too.I wanted to give it 3.5 stars but there is no option for that on Amazon...Is this movie was in school, it would have earned a B- or a strong C+.

I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I was pleasantly surprised at the few funny moments in this film. This is every bit a cat an mouse game. Also, I think people fail to realize that the normal procedures and customs in one place (in this case, the US) would not be the standard in other places (South Korea - where the film takes place). Meaning, what our cops would do, other cops in other countries wouldn't or can't. I loved this movie. I thought the acting was great.
