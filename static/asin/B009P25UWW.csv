It's basically a revenge tale shifting in time from medieval days to current times, although current times looks like the 70s, starting with Thompsons hair and outfits.  David Carradine made his last film, certainly not a glowing ending to his long career.  Horror stalwarts Billy Drago (a transvestite of all things!) and Udo Keir as a man of the cloth are added to validate the film's ""pedigree"", but the reality is NIGHT OF THE TEMPLAR is really little more than another future resident of the savings bin at Wal-Mart, a film that will be forgotten the minute you remove the DVD from your player.",1,THE DARK KNIGHT SINKS,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,714,"['Paul', 'Sampson', 'former', 'pin-up', 'model', 'wrote', 'produced', 'directed', 'stars', 'bumbling', 'attempt', 'film-making', 'basically', 'revenge', 'tale', 'shifting', 'time', 'medieval', 'days', 'current', 'times', 'current', 'times', '70s', 'starting', 'Thompsons', 'hair', 'outfits', 'David', 'Carradine', 'made', 'last', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'glowing', 'ending', 'long', 'career', 'Horror', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'transvestite', 'things', 'Udo', 'Keir', 'man', 'cloth', 'are', 'added', 'validate', 'film', 'pedigree', 'reality', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'TEMPLAR', 'really', 'little', 'more', 'future', 'resident', 'savings', 'bin', 'Wal-Mart', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'forgotten', 'minute', 'remove', 'DVD', 'player']",N/A

1601103,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B009P25UWW,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 2]","The story starts out giving us a Cliff Notes version of the Knights Templar. Lord Gregoire (Paul Sampson), the leader of the Templars is betrayed and killed by some of his own knights. He vows revenge in the 10th generation of the reincarnated souls or descendents or something. The story starts in 1095 or so and then jumps 700 years to the ""present.""The reincarnation aspect is most interesting since this is the tenth film that David Carradine as been in since he has died in 2009. Shouldn't someone be questioning this? To add to the plot continuity issues, only Lord Gregoire looks like his 700 year old self. Some of the people remember who they were 700 years ago, while others do not. Many of the men from long ago are now women. The film jumps back and forth between the present and 700 years ago. In the present day Jake McCallister is Lord Gregoire. He has anger management issues that makes our hero unlikeable. Isn't 700 years a long time to hold a grudge? Get over it!The present day cast reminded me of something that one might see from a modern ""Canterbury Tales"" line up including a cross dresser (Billy Drago), Priest (Udo Kier), shopkeeper (David Carradine), a fighter (Mary Christina Brown) and a prostitute (Sofie Norman). Much of the killing is done off screen. I liked the characters they created, they just did nothing with them.There is some mild humor in this film, some which may not be intentional. The 700 year old grudge script was just so bad, there was nothing this group could have done to save it other than to walk away from it. Not as good as ""Scorpion Kings 3"" for you Drago fans.Parental Guide: F-bomb, brief oral sex, brief nudity (Sofie Norman.)",3,HO HO HO IT'S MAGIC.,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,1685,"['story', 'out', 'giving', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'version', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'Lord', 'Gregoire', 'Paul', 'Sampson', 'leader', 'Templars', 'betrayed', 'killed', 'own', 'knights', 'revenge', '10th', 'generation', 'reincarnated', 'souls', 'descendents', 'something', 'story', '1095', 'so', 'then', '700', 'years', 'present', 'reincarnation', 'aspect', 'most', 'interesting', 'tenth', 'film', 'David', 'Carradine', 'been', 'died', '2009', 'Should', ""n't"", 'someone', 'be', 'questioning', 'add', 'plot', 'continuity', 'issues', 'only', 'Lord', 'Gregoire', '700', 'year', 'old', 'self', 'people', 'remember', 'who', 'were', '700', 'years', 'ago', 'others', 'do', 'not', 'Many', 'men', 'long', 'ago', 'are', 'now', 'women', 'film', 'back', 'forth', 'present', '700', 'years', 'ago', 'present', 'day', 'Jake', 'McCallister', 'Lord', 'Gregoire', 'anger', 'management', 'issues', 'hero', 'unlikeable', ""n't"", '700', 'years', 'long', 'time', 'hold', 'grudge', 'Get', 'present', 'day', 'cast', 'reminded', 'something', 'one', 'might', 'see', 'modern', 'Canterbury', 'Tales', 'line', 'up', 'including', 'cross', 'dresser', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'Priest', 'Udo', 'Kier', 'shopkeeper', 'David', 'Carradine', 'fighter', 'Mary', 'Christina', 'Brown', 'prostitute', 'Sofie', 'Norman', 'Much', 'killing', 'done', 'off', 'screen', 'liked', 'characters', 'created', 'just', 'did', 'nothing', 'them.There', 'mild', 'humor', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'intentional', '700', 'year', 'old', 'grudge', 'script', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'nothing', 'group', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'save', 'other', 'walk', 'away', 'Not', 'as', 'good', 'Scorpion', 'Kings', '3', 'Drago', 'fans.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bomb', 'brief', 'oral', 'sex', 'brief', 'nudity', 'Sofie', 'Norman']",N/A
