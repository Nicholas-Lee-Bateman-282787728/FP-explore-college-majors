1207702,A1JYTWPKHD4K18,B001KEGRA2,"Breezey1 ""Breezey1""","[4, 12]","Im going to first say that this DVD from the packaging looks very promising but looks can be deceiving. I dont know who from the various magazine comments/quotes written along the DVD example ""THE NEXT QUEEN OF COMEDY"", ""Smart funny and cooler than Samuel L. Jackson"" but they got their heads up where the sun dont shine and when it somes out they need a serious examination. From the beginning with the ""Noassatall"" rap video starting after you press play was the most irritating attempt at a comedy sketch music video I have ever seen before. After that the show doesnt get any better from the corny jokes to the lame delivery and poorly done imitations. I mean certain jokes and comments made me smile but that was it. Bottom line dont waste your money about the only thing Aisha Tyler seems to have going for her is her looks but she really needs to stay out of the stand up comedy scene if thats the best she has to offer. Im curious as to what the owners of the Fillmore was thinking having that show there considering the comedy legends that have graced their stage.

1207703,A1ME8I7QU6DWIB,B001KEGRA2,"Bridget Niki ""yoga, chemistry, but mainly chi...","[6, 9]","The ""no a*s at all"" rap at the beginning was about the last time I laughed out loud. But I just didnt dig this stand up. I was expecting real dry, smart sense of humor. But when she was imitating people and groaning and moaning all loud, it wasnt good. Her material and delivery is just not that funny. Even the audience never went hysterical. And you know why? Because she was not that funny. She talked about porn, marriage, being tall, exercise, drinking, masturbating, being (kind of) black, etc. I smiled a few times. Maybe she's just not my sense of humor (I really like Lisa Lampanelli, Louis CK, Kevin Hart, Brian Regan, Dane Cook, Dmitri Martin, Jaime Foxx, Chapelle). So if you kind of like those people, then you might not find this that funny. Aisha Tyler is beautiful but this was a disappointment.EDIT: Hmmmmm (as of review editing time) $1.50 for this DVD used.
