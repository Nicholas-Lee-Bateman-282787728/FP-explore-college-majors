Disregarding the negative comments on the site that talk about the film, if you've already seen it and loved it- this is a great economic release. It's not often that Korean (or any Asian films, for that matter) come with Spanish subtitles, but this one does!In short, it comes with subtitles in English and Spanish, as well as including an interview with Doona Bae, besides the trailer and highlights of the film.The Latin American region (R4 on DVD, I think) for Asian releases is greatly under-explored. I've actually never heard of an Asian film being properly released on an R4 DVD unless it's Crouching Tiger, so there's a huge vacuum for Spanish-speaking Asian film lovers that wouldn't necessarily know how to speak English, so I had always wondered why some of the publishers aren't trying to fill in this void. So thank you, Mongrel Media for this release. Hope you acquire more Asian titles and expand on the subtitle options.More publishers should do the same.",4,And comes with Spanish subtitles too!,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,1079,"['been', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'written', 'review', 'Amazon', 'thought', 'product', 'Disregarding', 'negative', 'comments', 'site', 'talk', 'film', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'loved', 'it-', 'great', 'economic', 'release', 'not', 'often', 'Korean', 'Asian', 'films', 'matter', 'come', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'one', 'short', 'subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'interview', 'Doona', 'Bae', 'trailer', 'highlights', 'film.The', 'Latin', 'American', 'region', 'R4', 'DVD', 'think', 'Asian', 'releases', 'greatly', 'under-explored', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'never', 'heard', 'Asian', 'film', 'being', 'properly', 'released', 'R4', 'DVD', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'huge', 'vacuum', 'Spanish-speaking', 'Asian', 'film', 'lovers', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'know', 'how', 'speak', 'English', 'had', 'always', 'wondered', 'why', 'publishers', 'are', ""n't"", 'trying', 'fill', 'void', 'So', 'thank', 'Mongrel', 'Media', 'release', 'Hope', 'acquire', 'more', 'Asian', 'titles', 'expand', 'subtitle', 'publishers', 'should', 'do', 'same']",Barking Dogs Never Bite

Lion ""kimbawlion.com""","[2, 13]","I didn't understand the point of this movie... unless it's meant to be an indictment of the Korean university system since the central character, a worthless, sociopathic loser, bribes his way into a professorship. There's only one likable character in the movie, a young woman who tries to do the right thing. Her only vice is wanting recognition, and her efforts to help people cause her to lose her job.The whole thing plays like a student film. A bunch of odd characters and odd situations with a story that goes nowhere. Lots of detail and no insight.

1347805,A15LK8DSFQZZ52,B003JSSPRK,"Patricia R. Andersen ""redheaded booklover""","[2, 15]","Maybe I just don't understand comedy. Or maybe Korean comedy is something Americans don't ""get"". Or maybe because I come from a culture where dogs are considered pets, I'm not laughing about dogs being killed and eaten for food. Or maybe I'm just as thick as a brick. But this was an awful movie and I would give it a zero rating if I could.None of the characters are likable with the exception of the office worker. The passive aggressive professor who realizes he has to bribe his way into the job, the depressed domineering pregnant wife who is still supporting both of them, the janitor who dines on dog - nothing. The office worker's friend is okay, but not really somebody you would choose to be the heroine.The want to be professor hates dogs. He suspects one of barking and getting on his nerves and he kidnaps the dog. He thinks about tossing it off a roof but doesn't. So he ends up locking the dog in a closet in the basement of his apartment complex. What a lovely guy. When he finds out that the dog he captured can't bark, he decides to get the dog back.  But it's too late. The janitor and one of his friends chop up and eat the dog.SO he finds the dog that is barking. It's a little old lady's companion. He steals the dog and tosses it off a roof. The office worker sees him and tries to catch him (it's too late for the dog) but he gets away. She shows the dog's dead body to the little old lady. She has a heart attack and later dies.So the professor's wife gets laid off. Not that the professor notices or seems to care. With part of her severance package, she buys a dog. She intends to use the rest of the money so her wonderful husband can make a bribe for a job. He's just the sort of person I'd want to teach somebody - if I was going to develop some sort of sociopath.He takes the dog for a walk while the park is being sprayed with insecticide. Yeah, there are clouds and clouds of insecticide and somehow the dog disappears.I'm with the wife on this event, I believe he purposely ""lost"" the dog. He searches for the dog because his wife tells him ""You're a dead man"" if he doesn't find the dog. He searches the basement and catches the janitor getting ready to make a meal. He fights with the janitor just to discover that the janitor has a whole chicken to cook this night, not a dog.Then there's the homeless hobo (not sure exactly). he had managed to steal the janitor's dog soup before and he has captured the professor's dog. He decides that some puppy stew would be just the thing for him. Through some weird manipulations, the office worker happens to be on the roof of the apartment complex at the same time the doggy prep is going to happen. She manages to save the dog but she needs a little help from her friend.The upshot? The professor confesses to the office worker. I don't know whether she doesn't believe him or is in shock. The professor gets his position. The office worker loses her job. The hobo gets arrested and the janitor dog napper is still able to prowl on dogs.I'm not sure what I'm supposed to take away from this. A man will do anything if he is pushed to his limits?  You can get away with murdering dogs? Trying to do a good deed is a waste of time because you lose your job? I did not see the comedy in this and would advise _no_ one to watch this movie.

1347806,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B003JSSPRK,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Flandersui Gae (A Dog of Flanders/Barking Dogs Never Bite) (Joon-ho Bong, 2000)Joon-ho Bong has developed into one of Korea's most popular directors both at home and overseas, first with The Host, the highest-grossing Korean film of all time (viz. review 10Mar2008 ish), and then with Mother, one of the most critically-acclaimed Korean films of all time (viz. review 30Mar2011 ish). But he had a career, and a durned good one, long before coming up with either of those flicks; his second movie, Memories of Murder, is actually my favorite of his flicks (viz. review 1Apr2008 ish), and while it didn't really gain notoriety outside Korea until after he'd gotten big for his other movies, his debut feature, Flandersui Gae (known in English-speaking countries both as A Dog of Flanders and Barking Dogs Never Bite), was a pretty big hit back in the day. If you know Bong's later work, there's not going to be a good deal here that will surprise you--it's got that patented Bong mix of madcap mystery, uncomfortable humor, broad-spectrum ineptitude on the part of his endearing characters, and a sharp, witty script that brings it all together in a pleasurable way.Plot: Yun-ju (Attack the Gas Station!'s Sun-jae Lee) is a college lecturer who's trying to achieve a professorship in a corrupt culture--it seems to be standard operating procedure for lecturers at his school who want to become professors to ""gift"" the dean with ten thousand bucks. Problem is, lecturers make peanuts, so where's he going to get that kind of money? As if that's not enough, somewhere in his large, faceless apartment block there's a yappy little dog who refuses to shut up. Yun-ju finds himself driven to extremes--once he has identified the beast, he kidnaps it. When he finds he can't bring himself to kill it, he locks it in a cabinet in the basement. When the missing-dog posters start going up, posted by both the dog's young owner and Hyeon-nam (Spring Bears Love's Doona Bae), an interested bookkeeper from the local tax office who had to give the posters an official stamp to make sure the cops didn't take them down, Yun-ju realizes he's got himself a case of mistaken identity--but when he goes to set the pooch free, it's gone...And this kicks off a series of misadventures that has the movie careering wildly between missing-dog mystery (animal lovers beware, there are a few scenes you may find uncomfortable despite the large, prominently-displayed title card at the beginning stating that no animals were harmed during the making of the film), romantic comedy, and Richard Linklater-style slacker drama, with the odd action sequence here and there just to keep the viewer on his or her toes. Like Memories of Murder, the end result seems somewhat directionless, and that does seem a bit more of a problem here than it is in Memories of Murder. But not much more; this movie is still a great deal of fun, as well as being quite technically accomplished for it being the director's feature debut. If you're a Joon-ho Bong fan who's never gotten the chance to check this one out, it may not quite measure up to Bong's later efforts, but it's still a pretty good time. ***",3,Bong's debut is uncomfortably hilarious.,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",2013,3164,"['Flandersui', 'Gae', 'A', 'Dog', 'Flanders/Barking', 'Dogs', 'Never', 'Bite', 'Joon-ho', 'Bong', '2000', 'Joon-ho', 'Bong', 'developed', 'one', 'Korea', 'most', 'popular', 'directors', 'home', 'overseas', 'first', 'Host', 'highest-grossing', 'Korean', 'film', 'time', 'viz', 'review', '10Mar2008', 'ish', 'then', 'Mother', 'one', 'most', 'critically-acclaimed', 'Korean', 'films', 'time', 'viz', 'review', '30Mar2011', 'ish', 'had', 'career', 'durned', 'good', 'one', 'long', 'before', 'coming', 'up', 'flicks', 'second', 'movie', 'Memories', 'Murder', 'actually', 'favorite', 'flicks', 'viz', 'review', '1Apr2008', 'ish', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'gain', 'notoriety', 'Korea', ""'d"", 'gotten', 'big', 'other', 'movies', 'debut', 'feature', 'Flandersui', 'Gae', 'known', 'English-speaking', 'countries', 'A', 'Dog', 'Flanders', 'Barking', 'Dogs', 'Never', 'Bite', 'was', 'pretty', 'big', 'hit', 'back', 'day', 'know', 'Bong', 'later', 'work', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'deal', 'here', 'will', 'surprise', 'got', 'patented', 'Bong', 'mix', 'madcap', 'mystery', 'uncomfortable', 'humor', 'broad-spectrum', 'ineptitude', 'part', 'endearing', 'characters', 'sharp', 'witty', 'script', 'together', 'pleasurable', 'way.Plot', 'Yun-ju', 'Attack', 'Gas', 'Station', 'Sun-jae', 'Lee', 'college', 'lecturer', 'who', 'trying', 'achieve', 'professorship', 'corrupt', 'culture', 'be', 'standard', 'operating', 'procedure', 'lecturers', 'school', 'who', 'want', 'become', 'professors', 'gift', 'dean', 'ten', 'thousand', 'bucks', 'Problem', 'lecturers', 'make', 'peanuts', 'where', 'going', 'get', 'kind', 'money', 'not', 'enough', 'somewhere', 'large', 'faceless', 'apartment', 'block', 'yappy', 'little', 'dog', 'who', 'shut', 'up', 'Yun-ju', 'driven', 'extremes', 'once', 'identified', 'beast', 'When', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'kill', 'cabinet', 'basement', 'When', 'missing-dog', 'posters', 'start', 'going', 'up', 'posted', 'dog', 'young', 'owner', 'Hyeon-nam', 'Spring', 'Bears', 'Love', 'Doona', 'Bae', 'interested', 'bookkeeper', 'local', 'tax', 'office', 'who', 'had', 'give', 'posters', 'official', 'stamp', 'make', 'sure', 'cops', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'down', 'Yun-ju', 'got', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'when', 'set', 'pooch', 'free', 'gone', 'off', 'series', 'misadventures', 'movie', 'careering', 'wildly', 'missing-dog', 'mystery', 'animal', 'lovers', 'beware', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'may', 'find', 'uncomfortable', 'large', 'prominently-displayed', 'title', 'card', 'beginning', 'stating', 'animals', 'were', 'harmed', 'making', 'film', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Richard', 'Linklater-style', 'slacker', 'drama', 'odd', 'action', 'sequence', 'here', 'there', 'just', 'keep', 'viewer', 'toes', 'Memories', 'Murder', 'end', 'result', 'somewhat', 'directionless', 'seem', 'bit', 'more', 'problem', 'here', 'Memories', 'Murder', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'still', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'quite', 'technically', 'accomplished', 'being', 'director', 'feature', 'debut', ""'re"", 'Joon-ho', 'Bong', 'fan', 'who', 'never', 'gotten', 'chance', 'check', 'one', 'out', 'may', 'not', 'quite', 'measure', 'Bong', 'later', 'efforts', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'time', '***']",Barking Dogs Never Bite
