IDENTITY THIEF, a perfectly entertaining comedy/road trip flick from Seth Gordon, is one of those instances. This year's first $100-million grossing film has taken critical brickbats and has even seen Rex Reed tear apart Melissa McCarthy's weight (nice going Rex -- plenty of things I can say about you but won't!), but the film itself is a crowd pleaser: good natured, funny in places, with solid chemistry between McCarthy as the frizzy haired title character and Jason Bateman as the hapless working man whose identity she steals. She's great, and the movie does enable her to do something more than play the ""crazy big woman"" in its second half, with some effective dramatic beats. Bateman is game too, and while the film isn't hilarious or particularly memorable, it is highly enjoyable especially if you like road-trip flicks with mismatched characters. Certainly there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours at the movies, which is exactly the type of thing that ""Identity Thief"" functions well as -- a decent timekiller with the two leads playing off each other extremely well.

Jason Bateman's businessman character has had his identity stolen by a crass, unrepentant con artist, played by Melissa McCarthy. While the two comedians have some chemistry, their styles never quite mesh -- Bateman reserved, and McCarthy (normally) completely outrageous and over the top -- and she seems to bend a bit more in his direction, holding herself in check while he never really cuts loose, even when his character goes rogue. There are funny, acerbic moments, bu the film never really catches fire. Lots of great Bateman slow-burns, a few over-the-top gags, but the overall delivery is kind of snoozy. This might have played better in a theater, I'm not sure, but as home video it was disappointing. Great to see McCarthy emerge as a leading character -- she's had great cameos in other recent films -- but she might have needed more free reign with this project. The bonus features were minimal, and the 30-second-long gag reel was a real dud -- super-short and seemed like it was just slapped on. Oh, well.

This is not one of them.The main problem that faces Identity Thief is the exact same thing that doomed The Mexican--it has no idea what it wants to be.  The Mexican had moments that were romantic comedy, moments that were action film, moments that were suspense thriller, and none of them were really fledged out very well nor did they mesh in a way that seemed at all natural, leaving a movie that just sat there and did nothing.  Identity Thief wants to be funny, heart warming, rude, action packed, suspenseful, and over-the-top in all of those areas.  It probably is possible for a movie to do that, but this one doesn't.It wants to be a buddy movie, but the buddies actually hate each other for at least 3/4 of the film.  It wants to have dramatic tension in it, but the comedic scenes short-circuit those moments.  It wants you to have an investment in these characters, but they are manipulated so heavily by the script that you never get a sense that they are making decisions or acting on their own.  These are people put in situations for the sake of maintaining a plot that has a very clear A to B to C trajectory that suffocates any potential for the characters to actually begin to seem like real people.It also doesn't help that you spend the first half hour angry and hating almost everyone except the two main characters, who are only marginally likable.  Jon Favreau is so good at being despicable in his cameo that you're actually filled with rage if you have even a minor sense of decency in your body.  John Cho's character is flopped back and forth by the needs he serves to the plot that he is not a character so much as a device.  You also get very little sense of Jason Bateman's family beyond the vaguest, most glancing sketch.  For all intents and purposes, his character of Sandy could just as easily be single for this movie, but a family provides a few cookie-cutter emotional moments near the end to try to garner sympathy from the viewers.Don't do it.  Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman are brilliant, but this movie completely wastes them on a cheap set-up on a predictable trajectory surrounded by paper-thin stereotype characters (the sociopathic red neck, the Latino drug dealer, the lonely good-ol' boy) who drag the entire ship down with them.  No actor could have saved this, ever.  Not even with a miracle from on high.  This is a steaming pile of a movie, and it makes me want to cry because I wanted so badly to love it, to even like it a little bit.  Ultimately, though, Identity Theft is like that abusive ex-lover you finally got the restraining order against--no matter how much you try to read the best into it, to make it seem better than it is, it will just throw another thing at you that makes you realize the lie you are telling yourself.  At its very best, it is a derivative comedy that squanders great talent.  At its worst, it's just mean-spirited and lazy.  These actors all deserve much better, and whoever green-lit this deserves to live in an alley for a couple years to think about what he did wrong.",1,An ironic name for a movie that has no identity of its own,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,3886,"['When', 'was', 'college', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'called', 'Mexican', 'had', 'everything', 'going', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'starring', 'Gore', 'Verbinski', 'directing', 'getting', 'released', 'Dreamworks', 'things', 'together', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'truly', 'amazing', 'movie', 'instead', 'made', 'biggest', 'screen', 'disaster', 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'forced', 'sit', 'wo', ""n't"", 'walk', 'out', 'movie', 'figure', '10', 'bucks', 'owe', 'myself', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'makers', 'least', 'watch', 'entire', 'film', 'Identity', 'Thief', 'same', 'realm', 'Mexican', 'should', 'be', 'comic', 'gold', 'horrible', 'so', 'horrible', 'am', 'actually', 'bit', 'sad', 'hate', 'see', 'what', 'when', 'good', 'people', 'make', 'bad', 'movies', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'are', 'brilliant', 'actors', 'Seth', 'Gordon', 'made', 'great', 'movies', 'not', 'one', 'them.The', 'main', 'problem', 'Identity', 'Thief', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'doomed', 'Mexican', 'idea', 'what', 'be', 'Mexican', 'had', 'moments', 'were', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'moments', 'were', 'action', 'film', 'moments', 'were', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'none', 'were', 'really', 'fledged', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'did', 'mesh', 'way', 'seemed', 'natural', 'leaving', 'movie', 'just', 'sat', 'did', 'nothing', 'Identity', 'Thief', 'be', 'funny', 'heart', 'warming', 'rude', 'action', 'packed', 'suspenseful', 'over-the-top', 'areas', 'probably', 'possible', 'movie', 'do', 'one', ""doesn't.It"", 'be', 'buddy', 'movie', 'buddies', 'actually', 'hate', 'other', 'least', '3/4', 'film', 'have', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'comedic', 'scenes', 'short-circuit', 'moments', 'have', 'investment', 'characters', 'are', 'manipulated', 'so', 'heavily', 'script', 'never', 'get', 'sense', 'are', 'making', 'decisions', 'acting', 'own', 'are', 'people', 'put', 'situations', 'sake', 'maintaining', 'plot', 'very', 'clear', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'trajectory', 'potential', 'characters', 'actually', 'begin', 'seem', 'real', 'people.It', 'also', ""n't"", 'help', 'spend', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'angry', 'hating', 'almost', 'everyone', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'only', 'marginally', 'likable', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'so', 'good', 'being', 'despicable', 'cameo', ""'re"", 'actually', 'filled', 'rage', 'have', 'even', 'minor', 'sense', 'decency', 'body', 'John', 'Cho', 'character', 'flopped', 'back', 'forth', 'needs', 'plot', 'not', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'device', 'also', 'get', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'family', 'vaguest', 'most', 'glancing', 'sketch', 'intents', 'purposes', 'character', 'Sandy', 'could', 'just', 'easily', 'be', 'single', 'movie', 'family', 'few', 'cookie-cutter', 'emotional', 'moments', 'end', 'try', 'garner', 'sympathy', 'viewers.Do', ""n't"", 'do', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'are', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'completely', 'cheap', 'set-up', 'predictable', 'trajectory', 'surrounded', 'paper-thin', 'stereotype', 'characters', 'sociopathic', 'red', 'neck', 'Latino', 'drug', 'dealer', 'lonely', 'good-ol', 'boy', 'who', 'drag', 'entire', 'ship', 'down', 'actor', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'ever', 'Not', 'even', 'miracle', 'high', 'steaming', 'pile', 'movie', 'want', 'cry', 'wanted', 'so', 'badly', 'love', 'even', 'like', 'little', 'bit', 'Ultimately', 'Identity', 'Theft', 'abusive', 'ex-lover', 'finally', 'got', 'restraining', 'order', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'try', 'read', 'best', 'make', 'seem', 'better', 'will', 'just', 'throw', 'thing', 'realize', 'lie', 'are', 'telling', 'very', 'best', 'derivative', 'comedy', 'great', 'talent', 'worst', 'just', 'mean-spirited', 'lazy', 'actors', 'deserve', 'much', 'better', 'whoever', 'green-lit', 'live', 'alley', 'couple', 'years', 'think', 'what', 'did', 'wrong']",Identity Thief

Sandy travels to Florida to confront Diana; and the two of them embark on a picaresque journey back to Sandy's home city of Denver, so that Diana can right some of the wrongs she caused.  The film's major shortcoming, however, is that it's just unfunny.  For those who like gross-out jokes about sex and a continual stream of coarse invective, I suppose it might have some attraction. Melissa McCarthy does the best she can with the script, but I wonder why director Todd Philips should find it necessary to make jokes at the expense of her size.

Her latest victim, Sandy Bigelow Patterson (Jason Bateman) discovers his credit cards have been maxed out, his credit rating has been destroyed &#8211; and the only way he can keep his new job is to bring the culprit to justice on his own.  Patterson flies to Florida and is forced to convince Diana to accompany him from Florida to Colorado in order to clear his name, all the while they are being followed by a group of individuals seeking revenge for another one of Diana&#8217;s recent cons.  John Cho, Robert Patrick, Amanda Peet, T.I. and Jon Favreau also star in supporting roles to round out the cast.First things first &#8211; Melissa McCarthy should absolutely be praised for this role, due in large part to her massive amount of charisma and outlandish shenanigans.  Her effortless knack for turning obvious dull punch lines into acceptable humor is the only saving grace to be found in such a dismal film.  She is the ONLY shining star in this disastrous film &#8211; and without McCarthy here to save it, this could easily have been a far worse movie than it already is.  At this point, there&#8217;s absolutely no reason to delve into the plot, since it&#8217;s so overly outlandish and absolutely ridiculous.Outside of McCarthy&#8217;s often Chris Farley-ish slapstick, and mostly raunchy comedy &#8211; it should continuously be stressed how remotely uninteresting his film truly turns out to be.  Jason Bateman is probably one of the most forgettable actors in all of Hollywood and it&#8217;s shocking that he&#8217;s even given any kind of starring role.  In all honesty, there are very few actors that could have been any less entertaining than Bateman and it&#8217;s almost unbearable to have to sit through any film where he is given a feature role.  He brings very little to the table and there are countless other actors/comedians that would have been a better fit for this particular film.  It&#8217;s not very often that anyone says this, but where was Ryan Reynolds when we needed him?Overall, Identity Theft is not worth one single dollar of your hard earned money and it&#8217;s definitely not worth the lengthy two hours of your time, which you&#8217;ll wish you had back.  Other than Movie 43, Identity Theft is easily the worst film thus far in 2013.  True enough, it&#8217;s only February &#8211; but films released this month are typically a good indicator of the quality of the film.  With very few memorable moments to speak of, Identity Theft easily lands itself in the &#8220;worst movie of the year&#8221; category.  This overly poor attempt to be funny will only serve to remind you of the current sad state of Saturday Night Live.

Director Seth Gordon keeps tight reigns on the genre he practically created (along with Paul Feig of Bridesmaids and Todd Phillips of Hangover/s). The presence of Jason Bateman counters the gross overly exaggerated performance of the ever larger Melissa McCarthy and the story requires little thought - just a lot of tolerance.The plot is well summarized elsewhere: 'Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman) gets a nice call confirming his name and other identifying information. The next thing he knows, a spa in Florida is reminding him of his appointment, and his credit cards are maxed out. With his identity stolen, Sandy leaves his wife, kids and job to literally bring the thief to justice in Colorado. But keeping tabs on the other Sandy (Melissa McCarthy) and run-ins with bounty hunters, is harder than he was expecting, and ultimately the cross-country trip is going to find both Sandys learning life tips from one another.'There are some guest appearances by John Favreau, Amanda Peet, Morris Chestnut, John Cho, T.I., Genesis Rodriquez, Robert Patrick and Eric Stonestreet and they add some sparkle. It is all a matter of mood and taste. For a comedy that is what it sets out to be  - a divergence from the usual - it works just fine for an evening's TV watching.

It didn't matter that she had another 50 fake IDs.Too many stupid things happen in the movie that make it hard to take it seriously, even for a comedy.

I thought the basic premise was interesting; a man gets his identity stolen and has to track down the woman because the police won't/can't do it. However, it never crossed my mind that that's where the interesting part of the plot would stop. There's almost no way to fill in those blanks with two hours worth of footage and make it memorable or, at the very least, enjoyable. Unfortunately, Identity Thief suffers from just that. An interesting idea in theory, but not one strong enough to warrant making a film about it.You follow a man by the name of Sandy Bigelow Patterson (Jason Bateman). As the title and trailers suggest, he gets his identity stolen by a woman named Diana (Melissa McCarthy). His work situation is complicated as he just joined a new business with an old coworker, Daniel Casey (John Cho). After receiving a bunch of weird calls he soon finds out that his identity was stolen and Daniel said that his bad credit scores are driving away potential clients. Because the police are incapable of helping Sandy, Daniel gives him one week to find the woman behind this and bring her to the police.After that things quickly turn sour as everything that follows soon becomes your run-of-the-mill road trip movie; two people have to go across country, they're completely opposite from one another, bad things happen, they get arrested, yada yada yada. It's almost sickening how cliched and formulaic this movie is, but that's not all. Both of these characters feel stiff, lifeless, and, once again, cliched. Sandy has a family and he needs to get this fixed or else they will be poor and Diana has a sad backstory which is why she does what she does. There's nothing unique about either of these characters and the same can be said about the movie as a whole.With that said, Identity Thief isn't all bad. The movie has plenty of laughs  scattered throughout it's lengthy running time, with most of them being provided by Bateman - it's never really what he said, it was more his actions and facial expressions. He's one of those actors that's very animated with his performances and I think that's why I've grown to enjoy him so much. To be completely honest, Bateman is one of the few things that actually holds the film together. He's returned with that clean cut, good guy character that we've seen him play multiple times before, but it works because he's so good at it.McCarthy, on the other hand, was less than stellar. It's reaching a point where she's starting to paint herself into this weird corner. Most of the jokes involving her are either about her weight or her character's fashion sense, which, apparently, is a product of her weight. I just don't understand why someone would continuously play a character like that. Everything I've seen her in recently has been the same thing and it looks like the same thing she's doing with her recent film The Heat. Fat jokes in general are tasteless, but when an actor or actress keeps involving themselves with those kinds of movies it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.Along with the two main leads you have a group of recurring characters. Amanda Peet plays Sandy's wife, Trish; Jon Favreau plays Sandy's old boss, Harold Cornish; Genesis Rodriguez and T.I. play Marisol and Julian, two hitmen sent to deal with Diana; Robert Patrick plays another hitman by the name of Skiptracer; and Morris Chestnut plays Detective Reilly. All of these supporting characters were interesting, with the exception of Marisol and Julian, and their respective actors all gave solid performances as well. Patrick and Chestnut in particular gave fun performances.Overall Score: 5.5/10 - Identity Thief is one of those comedies that has you laughing throughout, but at the end of it you're left feeling guilty. It relies on the same formula we've seen used countless times before and a good chunk of the jokes are tasteless. It lacks originality and inspiration and that's what ultimately ruins the experience. I would have a hard time recommending it because I can't see myself watching it again, but if you thought it looked interesting give it a shot.",3,5.5/10 - Formulaic and Forgettable,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,4221,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'going', 'Identity', 'Thief', 'thought', 'basic', 'premise', 'was', 'interesting', 'man', 'identity', 'stolen', 'track', 'down', 'woman', 'police', ""won't/ca"", ""n't"", 'do', 'However', 'never', 'crossed', 'mind', 'where', 'interesting', 'part', 'plot', 'would', 'stop', 'almost', 'way', 'fill', 'blanks', 'two', 'hours', 'footage', 'make', 'memorable', 'very', 'least', 'enjoyable', 'Unfortunately', 'Identity', 'Thief', 'suffers', 'just', 'interesting', 'idea', 'theory', 'not', 'one', 'strong', 'enough', 'warrant', 'making', 'film', 'it.You', 'follow', 'man', 'name', 'Sandy', 'Bigelow', 'Patterson', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'title', 'trailers', 'suggest', 'identity', 'stolen', 'woman', 'named', 'Diana', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'work', 'situation', 'complicated', 'just', 'joined', 'new', 'business', 'old', 'coworker', 'Daniel', 'Casey', 'John', 'Cho', 'receiving', 'bunch', 'weird', 'calls', 'soon', 'out', 'identity', 'was', 'stolen', 'Daniel', 'said', 'bad', 'credit', 'scores', 'are', 'driving', 'away', 'potential', 'clients', 'police', 'are', 'incapable', 'helping', 'Sandy', 'Daniel', 'one', 'week', 'find', 'woman', 'bring', 'police.After', 'things', 'quickly', 'turn', 'sour', 'everything', 'soon', 'becomes', 'run-of-the-mill', 'road', 'trip', 'movie', 'two', 'people', 'have', 'go', 'country', ""'re"", 'completely', 'opposite', 'one', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'get', 'arrested', 'yada', 'yada', 'almost', 'sickening', 'how', 'cliched', 'formulaic', 'movie', 'not', 'characters', 'feel', 'stiff', 'lifeless', 'once', 'again', 'cliched', 'Sandy', 'family', 'get', 'fixed', 'else', 'will', 'be', 'poor', 'Diana', 'sad', 'backstory', 'why', 'what', 'nothing', 'unique', 'characters', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'movie', 'whole.With', 'said', 'Identity', 'Thief', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'scattered', 'lengthy', 'running', 'time', 'most', 'being', 'provided', 'Bateman', 'never', 'really', 'what', 'said', 'was', 'more', 'actions', 'facial', 'expressions', 'one', 'actors', 'very', 'animated', 'performances', 'think', 'why', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'enjoy', 'so', 'much', 'be', 'completely', 'honest', 'Bateman', 'one', 'few', 'things', 'actually', 'film', 'together', 'returned', 'clean', 'cut', 'good', 'guy', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'multiple', 'times', 'so', 'good', 'it.McCarthy', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'less', 'stellar', 'reaching', 'point', 'where', 'starting', 'paint', 'weird', 'corner', 'Most', 'jokes', 'involving', 'are', 'weight', 'character', 'fashion', 'sense', 'apparently', 'product', 'weight', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'continuously', 'play', 'character', 'Everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'been', 'same', 'thing', 'same', 'thing', 'doing', 'recent', 'film', 'Heat', 'Fat', 'jokes', 'general', 'are', 'tasteless', 'when', 'actor', 'actress', 'keeps', 'involving', 'kinds', 'movies', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth.Along', 'two', 'main', 'leads', 'have', 'group', 'recurring', 'characters', 'Amanda', 'Peet', 'Sandy', 'wife', 'Trish', 'Jon', 'Favreau', 'Sandy', 'old', 'boss', 'Harold', 'Cornish', 'Genesis', 'Rodriguez', 'T.I', 'play', 'Marisol', 'Julian', 'two', 'hitmen', 'sent', 'deal', 'Diana', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'hitman', 'name', 'Skiptracer', 'Morris', 'Chestnut', 'Detective', 'Reilly', 'supporting', 'characters', 'were', 'interesting', 'exception', 'Marisol', 'Julian', 'respective', 'actors', 'gave', 'solid', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'Patrick', 'Chestnut', 'particular', 'gave', 'fun', 'performances.Overall', 'Score', '5.5/10', 'Identity', 'Thief', 'one', 'comedies', 'laughing', 'end', ""'re"", 'left', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'same', 'formula', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'used', 'countless', 'times', 'good', 'chunk', 'jokes', 'are', 'tasteless', 'originality', 'inspiration', 'what', 'ultimately', 'experience', 'would', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'recommending', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'watching', 'again', 'thought', 'looked', 'interesting', 'give', 'shot']",Identity Thief

1579474,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B0090JB6DC,judy,"[0, 0]","Identity Thief! It sure does bring out the awareness, about your identities being stolen. When I first saw the trailer back in January I thought this was going to be very funny, and while it was funny, it's not that funny. Melissa McCarthy didn't look like Melissa, which was neat. I was disappointed at how the film failed to make the best of its actors, and  ideas. The film doesn't really give out that many good jokes. Well anyway let's start off this review with the negatives, which include the jokes, script, sub-plot, supporting cast, miss - use of actors, and dragging. This film is just not funny. You'd think that with Melissa McCarthy,  break through actress from Bridesmaid, could make this film a truly funny film, which was  said to be proven when the very funny trailer premiered, well most of the sole jokes were in the trailer. Jason Bateman is a wooden stick, that if used right could be a comedic relief, but most of the time he wasn't, and he appeared as a thin, anti-funny person. I am sad to admit this but this is just not funny, and should have been funnier, and could a been too. The script started out decent but started to get bland as soon as we meet Marisol and Julian.  It kinda gets boring and insulting as well. Nothing really works in the middle. We have an idiot tracker who kidnaps the fat lady, whose real name we don't know till the end, but everyone just calls her Diana. What we receive is a pretty gloomy, middle with very little jokes, except for one moment in which Diana sings tunes from songs in a car. The sub - plot with the tracker, and the two people going after Diana. It's pretty dumb, and boring, and I really wished to fast forward threw those parts as the characters are not that important to the film, and they appear pretty randomly threw out the movie.  The supporting cast, really don't help the movie and the worst examples include Jon Favreau as the UN - necessary and UN - funny boss of Jason Bateman's character. Jon, just didn't belong in the film, he should stick to his Elf and Iron Man roles. And Robert Patrick as the bounty hunter, well he's just plain annoying. I hated the actor, and his acting, and I hated his screen time. This film miss uses its cast. Melissa McCarthy, is given very little funny dialogue, and Jason Bateman isn't made fun of enough.  John Cho is an excellent cast member not seen enough at the beginning!  This film drags a lot, during the middle section of this film.  The film can't come to decide what to do and often bores while trying to decide what to do with its self. The positives for this film include the leads, make up, message, music, and the plot. The leads are excellent! Jason Bateman is the hardworking, family man, whose identity is stolen, and Melissa McCarthy is the tough and funky identity thief.  Melissa McCarthy is very funny and energetic in her role, and while she doesn't share much comedy with Jason Bateman, she still is able to pull off one or two, and Jason Bateman's character is a truly good dude, and a person who provides for his family whose life turns upside down. The makeup is excellent, and Melissa looks very - not her actually, and she looks instead like Diana. Very detailed her and make up, and she looks colorful and ugly.  The film's message is a big deal. The message is this, don't trust anyone.  And that  you can lose your job, most of your money, be warranted for jail, and have no car. So the message, while spread out wacky like is still strong and legit in a stupid way.  The music is funky and fun to hear. It is original and just lively. The plot is original, well sort of; it has the same formulaic, capture and road trip kind of deal with it but it also is supported by having a crazy lady and a guy who goes to get his Identity back. It's a plot I hadn't heard of before watching this.  All an All this film is  few in jokes that work, and drags but Melissa  is funny, and the music fun, making this not so much un enjoyable.

Music by Christopher Lennertz.Storyline: Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman) is an accountant in a multinational firm, living in Denver with his pregnant wife and two daughters. He struggles to make his ends meet due to low salary for a long time. Just at this moment, his credit card identity gets stolen through a fake call from a woman (Melissa). She is a professional identity thief with card printing machine and does this to live a lavish life at the expense of others. Sandy realizes one day about his stolen identity when his credit card gets declined in a petrol station, due to his outstanding dues on the card. Sandy almost loses his new job due to involvement of police and vows to prove his innocence by getting hold of the imposter. He finds her in Colorado and struggles to get her back to Denver and make her confess her guilt. During the journey, he develops a soft corner for her when he learns that she is an orphan and without a proper identity or a person to care for her, which shaped her behavior. Similarly, she also respects Sandy for his true gentleman nature and after meeting his beautiful small family. She finally confesses her fraud to the police and helps Sandy retain his job and good name once again. In return Sandy Patterson fetches her a new name and a her true identity forever, from government records.Positives: A soft comedy with crime of a different nature mixed in right proportions. Melissa&#8217;s performance has taken the lion&#8217;s share of the movie. Her chubby body shape gives scope for enough comedy scenes. Nice car chases.Negatives: The story is not new and nothing novel in the idea. Crime model is not practical as such fraudulent usage of credit cards can be easily traced and curbed due to latest technology. Involvement of some hooligans trying to get hold of Melissa seemed to be unnecessary. Comedy scenes are limited to Melissa and more of emotion linked to Jason&#8217;s role.

Well, I guess I learned that someone who has donned your identity can go to jail blamelessly as you and when they skip town you're the one who gets roped in.

However, my wife and I were looking for something funny, mindless and raunchy in the vein of ""40 year old Virgin"" or ""Hangover I"" - both well done, excellent, silly comedies for a Friday night after the kids go to bed, so we took a risk, without being aware of the 19% rotten tomatoes rating or the review on Amazon.Shame on us, because there are literally a handful of movies that are so bad they make me cringe with irritation having to sit through them, and this is one of them.  We did expect lewdness and swearing as we would from any comedy with an 'R' rating - so that didn't bother me in the least.  No, it was the fact that it was not only unfunny, but had a vile theme (Identity theft), a completely unbelievable premise, unlikable characters, and nonsensical situations seemingly patched together.Director Seth Gordon got a pass on the mediocre ""Horrible Bosses"", but this time he unleashed something truly worthless from script to premise to execution.  First there's the comedy - there is none really.  There are the usual cheap slapstick gags about fat people, alternative lifestyles, gay people, etc. etc. etc.  There are the thick ""hillbilly"" accents and stereotypes of various types of people - all poorly done at that.  The gags occur with a 1-2 punch of pointlessness and randomness that makes me wonder if they took stock bits out of other failed scripts to patch a movie together to meet a deadline.  Here's an example - the main character's name is Sandy Patterson.  Throughout the movie, when he gives his name to anyone, they without fail ask him why he was given a girls name.  It's a real knee-slapper.  I guess they could build comedies around guys named Taylor also (this will be the sequel God help us).But what I really found repulsive was the attempt to create a sympathetic heroine out of a trollish woman who commits identity theft then uses her ill gotten goods to go on drinking binges, rack up DUIs, and purchase consumer goods she doesn't need - in effect justifying and propagating the all too common view in society that it's okay to break the rules because the man has somehow been unfair to you.  It's reflective of a real sense of entitlement that is impacting this country.  I have a hard time seeing the humor in it, and it at any rate makes for lousy entertainment.

He takes a risk and changes employers, and all seems to be going in the right direction until he is told that his credit cards are maxed out and there is a warrant out for his arrest.

There are also moments when it wants to be and fails.  And then there are a number of half-funny moments.The real problem is the identity thief herself.  The more the audience gets to know Melissa McCarthy's character, the less funny the film is.  I'm not used to a comedy that loses laughs as it progresses.  Additionally, there is barely any explanation of exactly why others are chasing her.

And just because they put some hip music with two well known actors to it doesn't make it any more true.There is the socialism sub-text that the Obama administration has been peddling. Jason Bateman's character supposedly does more work than the founders of his employer and they get 100% more money than him which is ""unfair"". Whatever. Funny how his character takes all the clients with him a few coworkers who defect to start their own company so he can make $250K a year. I guess ""he"" deserves it because it is him. That is what socialism, to me, is about. And this movie throws it right in there.Profanity is just a lazy person's attempt at being ""funny"". It isn't funny. It is just offensive. And that is what 98% of this movie's ""humor"" is . . . filthy comments and innuendo. And when you have a character you are supposed to feel sorry for and then identify with and then root for . . . having them be a disgusting immoral person isn't the way to do it for most self-respecting viewers. Even Bateman's character calls her ""disgusting"". She is.Also McCarthy really should lose some weight. She is just painful to watch. Big is  NOT beautiful. It is just unhealthy. It is NOT funny. It is just gross. She looks like someone made up like a clown waddling around with big hair and a dumb wild eyed look on her face. Watching her in those highway scenes running in slow motion because she is so short and overweight she can't move is just sad. I am not being mean or derogatory but honest.

1579769,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0090JB6DC,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 2]","Melissa McCarthy is a force to be reckoned with. In the space of a few films and one hit television show, she has become a new comedic leading lady, not an easy feat. In her few film performances, she has shown tremendous promise; in ""Bridesmaids"", she proved she was willing and able to do anything for a laugh and in the recent Judd Apatow film ""We are 40 and Whiny"" (or ""This is 40"", but I believe in truth in advertising, Mr. Apatow), her two brief scenes are the best in the film. In fact, one of these plays unedited during the end credits and this provides more laughs than the rest of the two hour plus film. In each film, she imbues her characters with an instant funny quality making each performance memorable and entertaining. The fact that she seems to be willing and able to do anything for a laugh is fairly stereotypical of plus-sized comedians, male or female, but McCarthy also brings a lot of humanity to her characters allowing us underneath the bombastic exterior and making her characters much more believable and interesting than most other comedians.""Identity Thief"", directed by Seth Gordon (""The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters"", ""Horrible Bosses""), and co-starring Jason Bateman, allows McCarthy to bring all of these traits to her portrayal of Sandy Bigelow Patterson, a bottom feeder living in Florida who steals the identity of Bateman's straight-laced family man Sandy Bigleow Patterson who has just received a promotion at a new financial services firm in Denver. McCarthy is, by far, the best part of ""Thief"", providing the laughs that make the film watchable.From the moment she first appears, with a big bush of red hair on top of her head, wearing pastel and floral prints, she looks like Lucille Ball on steroids. But throughout the film, she is given moments, many of which are accomplished with a simple look, which help to reveal the pain that drives her character's actions.Naturally, because Sandy is ruining Sandy's credit history, it is threatening Sandy's new job, prompting Bateman's Sandy to drive to Florida to retrieve the criminal and bring her back to Denver to help him clear up the mess. This type of role, the oppressed Caucasian male doing a slow burn with every new development, is pretty much Bateman's stock and trade. He has played this role before, many times, and he does it so well he should get it trademarked. But while he is perfectly serviceable as the straight man in this comedic duo, the role of Sandy the First doesn't give him a lot to do to make his character interesting or funny. He really isn't either. And that makes ""Identity Thief"" lopsided.It doesn't help that every other actor in the film is pretty dull and uninteresting. John Cho plays Sandy's new boss and does the role completely straight. Morris Chestnut is the Denver cop who helps Bateman's character figure out what is going on. Again, completely realistic and nothing interesting here. Amanda Peet plays Bateman's wife. She is good, but not funny.Because the cops are unwilling to lift a finger and do some work, Sandy decides to travel to Florida, on his own, and bring Sandy back to Denver. Roadtrip! Robert Patrick plays a bounty hunter and T.I. Harris and Genesis Rodriguez play two hit men. These three roles prove to be more of a distraction than anything else. Yes, they fulfill their purpose and keep the two Sandys moving towards Denver, but they don't provide a single laugh. Eric Stonestreet (TV's ""Modern Family"") plays an over-the-top small-town realtor who likes to swing. His character has a few moments with McCarthy, but these happen pretty much in the middle of the film. Once Sandy and Sandy move on, his character disappears and no one is around to take his place.In a road movie, all of the wacky characters the two leads encounter are there to provide little bursts of energy and interest before the leads move on to the next group. In ""Identity Thief"", this doesn't happen so there are long periods when nothing funny happens. Yes, there are laughs but it seems like you have to travel miles to get to the next one. In the recent ""Guilt Trip"" starring Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen, the supporting characters, most of whom are played by well-known character actors, pop up along the journey. Yet, each of them barely registers. So the focus of the film is on Streisand and Rogen. They actually fare better because there is a little more give and take in their relationship. Streisand has some laughs and some drama. Rogen has some laughs and some drama. In ""Thief"", everything rests on McCarthy's shoulders.The slow burn thing that Bateman does is necessary to the film, because there needs to be a more normal person at the center of the journey. He has played this character before and could probably do the role in his sleep. When the role is played completely straight, as it is here, there are just no laughs and it becomes boring. There are a few moments when he has the opportunity to let loose and do something, anything for a laugh but these are not taken advantage of and become wasted opportunities. Each time, it seems like his slow burn is supposed to carry these moments into a laugh - he frequently reacts to someone by saying ""Really?"" in a low voice. But because we expect this type of behavior from him, it doesn't surprise or shock us when he reacts. Even though Bateman does this character well, I am bored with it and wish he would do something different and radical.Seth Gordon first made his mark with a really good documentary called ""The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters"" about two rivals competing for a title in the arcade game industry. Then, Hollywood swooped in and put him at the helm of some very mediocre big budget studio comedies. ""Four Christmases""? Yikes! But last year, he made one of the best comedies released by a studio. ""Horrible Bosses"" is just different; the characters don't do what we expect them to do, the story is funny and the laughs are dark. It also provided a burst of energy to Jennifer Aniston's career, casting her as a character so different from any we have seen before. ""Bosses"" also stars Bateman, again doing the slow burn, but because he decides to get even with his boss (Kevin Spacey), Bateman has more to do and delivers more laughs. He is also one member of a trio of buddies, a modern-day Three Stooges and he plays well with Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day. In ""Thief"", Gordon takes a step backward and presents a pretty routine road trip comedy.""Identity Thief"" is uneven, routine and unexceptional except for the laughs generated by Melissa McCarthy. But I don't think these moments are enough to warrant anything more than a bargain matinee. Maybe.",2,"""Thief"" Will Steal Your Hard Earned Money...",1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,6691,"['Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'space', 'few', 'films', 'one', 'hit', 'television',

1579774,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B0090JB6DC,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","Melissa McCarthy is one of the funniest females in Hollywood. After wasting her talent for 7 seasons on Gilmore Girls, she finally got her big break and hasn't slowed down since. One of her latest films is Identity Thief, which is also Seth Gordon's follow up to the hit comedy, Horrible Bosses. Much like his last film, Identity Thief has a whole bunch of funny scenes and outrageous characters, but fails to deliver a solid story to go with it. Sandy Bigelow Patterson (Jason Bateman) is a man with a girls name, making him the prime target for a female (Melissa McCarthy) who makes a living stealing from everyone else. The laws surrounding identity theft make prosecutions very difficult and it can sometimes take years before everything is straightened out. Patterson, with his new job and home on the line, can't wait for that and decides to confront his assailant. As I said earlier there are some real funny moments in this film, but the story is sadly extremely predictable. Identity Theft is something that has never really been done in comedy before. With the right story behind it, this really could have been the next Hangover, but sadly, the Hangover it is not. As usual Bateman and McCarthy are both terrific and to my surprise, had some pretty good chemistry together. Identity Thief is not a movie that sticks with you long after it's over.

She steals Bateman's/Sandy's identity at a crucial time in his life and the police are not being that helpful. So, he sets out to correct the situation which means bringing her from Florida to Colorado and tricking her into confessing her crimes.This movie quite funny. Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy worked well together. McCarthy, for the most part, can he hilarious. Even Bateman's straight man performance was packed with some good comedic moments.The quality of the movie being streamed is very good. The audio and filming are well done.Family friendly: In my opinion, McCarthy can be quite vulgar at times. Her discussion about sex to Bateman's/Sandy's two children at the end was very out of place and even made this 50 year old man feel uncomfortable. There are a few bad words, a sex scene in a hotel room and you see a man nekkid from behind.

It doesn't know if it is a on-the-road buddy comedy, a mob hit movie, or a tear- jerker. Also, again, Jason Bateman plays the same character he's been playing ever since he started acting in adult roles. He and Melissa McCarthy have no on-screen chemistry whatsoever. It's amazing Hollywood keeps on giving Bateman acting jobs because he plays the same character over-and-over again and his acting style hasn't changed. The tone of the film is all wrong (or all over the place). For instance, actor Robert Patrick (Terminator 2:Judgement Day) as Skiptracer in the role of a bounty hunter is all too serious and all too straight. His scenes are so mean-spirited that they do not gel with the comedy part of the movie. Also, there is a pair of hit-persons (Marisol & Julian) whose dialogue are some of the worst lines written for mob hit men in the history of crime drama cinema and whose scenes do not gel with the movie. Melissa McCarthy is fine with what little the writer/director has given her so she's not at fault here because she switched from comedy to dramatic when the scene called for it. However, it just didn't sit well and it was sometimes uncomfortable when one is expecting comedy and all of a sudden, a serious scene pops up out of nowhere.
