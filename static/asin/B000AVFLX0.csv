933794,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000AVFLX0,A Customer,"[7, 19]","Overlong, pretentious, and overstuffed with voice-overs and affected quotes, Wong Kar-wai's 2046 looks beautiful and is indeed sensuous, but the film is ultimately so muddled that most viewers will find themselves becoming lost in some kind of vague storytelling fog. The actors are all handsomely costumed and the art direction is gorgeous, but the story is so convoluted and mysterious, that the film ends up totally being off putting and really quite boring.In the claustrophobic world of 2046 the characters exist in a netherworld of dream and memory, holed up in tiny flats, narrow corridors, and small intimate restaurants. The film takes place in Hong Kong in the 1960's during a period of political instability, and everyone is dressed elegantly in '60s-style clothes and hairdos, cigarette smoke still curls in the air in imaginative patterns, and American pop music plays softly in the background. It's all very sophisticated and decadently arty.Tony Leung stars as Chow, a freelance writer who fanatically scribbles stories involving the hotel room 2046. A beautiful prostitute in whose company Chow keeps occupies room 2046, and as he movies into the room next door he becomes fixated with her. Also in his story, a passenger has boarded a train headed for 2046, where the hostess is an android who can never leave the train. The more Chow writes, the more the story delves into his past.Bai Ling ((Ziyi Zhang) and Chow starting out as drinking buddies, the two wind up in a torrid romance. When his ardor predictably wanes, Bai Ling is devastated because she has fallen in love with him. She finally abandons the flat, but the two of them have connected not only physically but spiritually as well.Meanwhile, the landlord moved in his daughter (Faye Wong). She is too in love with her Japanese boyfriend (Takuya Kimura), of whom her father disapproves, to become more than a friend to the writer. He clearly longs for her, although he is haunted by Bai and also by the memory of Su (Gong Li).The Asian actresses are absolutely gorgeous, but they all look the same, so it took me an hour to figure out who was who, and by then, I'd lost the thread of the story. But the actors are all fairly convincing and you really do believe that Chow - with his whisker of a mustache and his low rent sex appeal - is the type that would make the members of the opposite sex go weak at the knees.But the major problem with 2046 is that it's just too arty and self conscious for its own good. Every scene is manicured and coloured to within an inch and breadth of its life - there's just so many gorgeous outfits glinting in the half-dark; so much creaseless ravishment in the high silk collar of a Chinese dress; so much whispery coiling tendrils of smoke, and so much artfully pouring rain that merely patters around the characters, not ever getting them wet. It all becomes rather tawdry and yawn inducing after a while.I guess 2046 is supposed to be about the importance of memory and purports to a future where humans are whizzing around super fast trains in gleaming cities heading for a place where they can recapture their memories. The middle of the movie has Chow sitting on a train that is staffed by exquisite female robots - he seems to be besotted with them as well. It's a visually exciting part of the film, and gorgeous to look at, but it's also the most boring part, and this conceit of android eroticism just doesn't sit well with the rest of the story.I'm still not quite sure what exactly 2046 is supposed to be. It is the number of a hotel room which people have trouble leaving? Or is it a year in the future where part of the story is set? Or is it perhaps some kind of date? Or does it just exist in Chow's memories and writings? One thing is for sure, this movie moves so slowly that you'll swear that 2046 is also the number of minutes in the film's running length, by the end you'll feel like you have boarded Chow's train too, as you try to stay awake through this one.

933795,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B000AVFLX0,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[5, 15]","I believe Kar Wai Wong is one of the greatest directors this planet has ever seen.  His ability to bring images and characters together cannot be compared to any other living director.  He is original, energetic, and all together poetic with his form and style.  Wong's work is what those infamous directors of Hollywood dream about at night.  I was impressed with his gripping tale of love in Happy Together and mesmerized by his emotionally draining film In the Mood for Love.  Wong is brilliant behind the camera, creating some of the most beautiful visuals ever to grace the silver screen.  Alas, I can spend all day here speaking about this master's work, but it doesn't conceal the fact that 2046 was not his best work released.  As a man who enjoyed Happy Together and In the Mood for Love, I was expecting nothing short of perfection with this film, yet somehow, I did not get it.  I believe I was duped by the marketing behind this film.  I must warn others that if you are renting this film expecting a science fiction film, you will be greatly disappointed.  I even thought that it would follow a path similar to Blade Runner, but again, I was wrong.  After watching 2046 all I could think about was Wong's refrigerator.  This film reminded me of all the leftovers in Wong's fridge.  If you took all the elements that made his prior films extraordinary and slopped them together on one plate, threw it in the microwave, and watched it cook, than you would be experiencing 2046.  This film was nothing more than Wong's leftovers handed to us in hopes we wouldn't see through the charade.Harsh words, I agree, but I didn't feel the emotional strain, the power of the characters, or the challenge of the story as I did with his prior two films that I experienced.  Kar Wai Wong is a brilliant cinematographer, capturing some of the most beautiful images in film, I believe though that he didn't quite know what to do with them all in this film.  In 2046, we are handed, nearly pounded down, with image after glorious image of characters attempting to build their lives together.  With pastels, blurred backgrounds, and off centered camera angles, Wong has created one of the most beautiful films of 2005!  Yet, no amount of beauty can honestly disguise leftovers.  Everyone in the house knows what you are serving, there is no need to literally color-coat it.  One of the images that annoyed me greatly was that centered around Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Ziyi Zhang in a taxicab after a night of drinking.  We even revisit it later in the film, but was annoyed me about this scene is that it is exactly the same scene from Happy Together, nearly cut and pasted onto another film.  The final conclusionary remarks of this film were completely reused from In the Mood for Love, while breathtaking in its own sense, it just didn't work for me to have all of these repetitive scenes.  I wanted creative Kar Wai Wong, but all I was handed was a poorly spliced reprint of his older films.Science fiction is a difficult genre to handle.  A GOOD sci-fi film is a rarity.  2046 is not a science fiction film.  For those considering this film due to the sci-fi press that it received, you will be surely misguided.  There are moments in the film that are supposed to be in our future, but they are so poorly crafted that they distract from the already budding story.  I believe it is these science fiction ""train"" elements were cheap, dull, and completely underdeveloped.  In fact, they stole from the rest of the film.  In 2046, it is not uncommon for you to find yourself completely caught up in a character, learning about their mannerisms and challenges, only to be snapped into this random world which trains have apparently become the dominate species.  While other praise Wong's work in these moments of the film, I believe them to be very unlike Wong.  These paper mache science fiction elements were not the reasons I first fell in love with Wong's work.  While changing genres may work well for the likes of Spielberg and Ang Lee, for Wong it doesn't.  Wong does better with his character driven stories that are simple, yet beautiful enough to keep your eyes on the screen.  2046 was so poorly developed that sleep seemed like a better option, and I hate to say that about Wong's work.The characters were decent with the material they were given.  Ziyi Zhang gives a Nicole Kidman-esque performance that should open up more and more doors for her.  Her range is amazing, and I think that Wong captured it extremely well.  This was less of a character-developed story and more of an actual plot, which is where I believe Wong theoretically shot himself in the foot. Wong need to keep with characters and beautiful scenery and his stories will then just fall into place.  I must admit, this was a confusing tale.  I was intrigued one minute and befuddled the next.  2046 is not a film for the light of film watchers.  It is not your ""date night"" film, but instead one that needs to be watched with microscopes attached to your eyes to ensure that you do not miss any elements.  I, a novice film watcher, had trouble following this film.  Wong didn't fully have his direction tied on tightly enough with this film.Overall, I wasn't impressed. I could not watch this film again.  I saw what Wong wanted to accomplish with this film, I do not think that he had enough control over the finished product.  2046 reminded me of my first thesis paper.  I knew what my thesis wanted to be, but it was buried so deep within my paper that it ultimately ruined the entire body of work.Grade: ** out of *****",2,Why can't it be like it was

anything but.'2046' is the story of Chow Mo-won.As played by Tony Leung Chiu Wai,Mr.Chow is a newspaper writer who leaves behind the love of his life to and ends up living in a hotel room labeled 2046.This number sets off the idea for Chow to begin writing a novel about a city of the future of emotional release.Suddenly the reality of his life becomes intermingled with the fantasy of his writing as he smoothly seduces and uses many diverse ladies-the affairs themselfs to become mere characters in his novel.Come to find how Chow does find himself having actually falling in love with his ghost writer until he actually finds himself too emotionally distant to make any kind of commitment.Struggling to merge a happy ending in his prose with he's seemingly unhappy real life Chow ends up an disipated,broken man who continues longing for the love of his life,gambling his life and his money away-with no resolution to his real life drama or his written fantasy.'2046' is not without it's adherants.It makes an obscure but significant personal statement and it's use of photography and visual effects is very compelling and unique.Yet on the other hand the movie has a few flaws.For one it seems to run too long and has alot of slow moments.The film is filled with false stops and tends to drive the point home almost endlessly.As the other reviewer of this film here pointed out,another problem is that most of the characters in this film are highly unlikable.Chow and most of the ladies with whom he keeps company are selfish and sometimes shallow people who end up insensative to everyone else and tend to exist for little else then carnal pleasures.It's only when they fall in love do they show any kind of vulnerabilty,which is sad considering that the few likable characters (including Chow's ghostwriter) are reduced insignificant plot devices.'2046' works better visually then it does as a character piece-the acting is brilliant and the storyline is very involving.Yet at the same time one is drawn into the style of the film making-a surreal use of shadows,slow motion and distortion effects that are all tastefully done.The plot likens Chow's real life and his science fiction world-dropping in and out of both worlds until one cannot tell which is real or fantasy.So this romantic drama/avante-garde science fiction fusion really hits you either

933798,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000AVFLX0,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 3]","At the core of `2046' (the sequel to the ravishing `In the Mood for Love') lies that provocative question.  Can one truly love another and receive the same burgeoning love in return?  One may quickly respond in the affirmative, but one must really sit back and question what their idea of love really is.  When watching `2046' it almost because too obvious that no two people can love one another in the same way, thus proving the point that no true form of love is reciprocated.Sobering, I know.In `2046' we once again follow the character of Chow Mo-wan (thankfully played once again by Tony Leung).  The film takes place a few years after the affairs recorded in `In the Mood for Love', this time focusing on Chow's affairs with a number of women.  2046 is a hotel room number.  We first see this room when Chow accompanies an old acquaintance, a beautiful woman who is later stabbed by a jealous boyfriend.  On a whim, Chow offers to rent out the room, only to take the room next to it, 2047.  Over the next few years the room 2046 becomes somewhat of a symbol for Chow's determination to find love.  Through his interactions with three women (a card shark named Black Widow, his landlord's daughter, Wang Jing-wen and a beautiful prostitute named Bai Ling) we discover many sides to Chow but also discover the root of this film.No two loves are the same, thus no love can truly be reciprocated.2046 thus becomes the focal point of a work of fiction Chow writes to reflect his own emotional feelings.  2046 becomes a year, a year where everything stays the same, a year where many people travel to regain lost memories.  2046 represents the love that Chow felt for Su Li-zhen (his love portrayed by Maggie Cheung in `In the Mood for Love').While I found Tony Leung to be truly effective, I also found him to be a canvas on which his female co-stars painted their elaborate pictures of self expression.  Gong Li, Faye Wong and the brilliant Ziyi Zhang were all phenomenal here.  Zhang especially is all sorts of Oscar worthy here.  It's a shame that the performance getting all sorts of Oscar awards buzz that year was her weaker `Memoirs of a Geisha' performance.  Here she is utterly astonishing, carrying the emotional cavity of her character without every losing the flirtatious quality that made her mysteriously engaging.  Wong also holds her own VERY well, creating a woman who is young and nave yet enticing.  Li is always marvelous, but what she does here with such little screen time is unforgettable (that breakdown against the wall...OMG).While I don't think that `2046' is as strong as `In the Mood for Love', I must say that this is a perfect compliment.  It takes that films burning desire and amplifies it with luscious sequences that burn themselves into our minds.  Director Kar Wai Wong's stylistic approach to his work is in full effect here as he creates unforgettable imagery that perfectly compliments the emotional gravity of his story.Pain has never looked so inviting.",5,Is true love ever reciprocated?,1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,2997,"['core', '2046', 'sequel', 'ravishing', 'Mood', 'Love', 'provocative', 'question', 'Can', 'one', 'truly', 'love', 'receive', 'same', 'burgeoning', 'love', 'return', 'One', 'may', 'quickly', 'respond', 'affirmative', 'one', 'must', 'really', 'sit', 'back', 'question', 'what', 'idea', 'love', 'really', 'When', 'watching', '2046', 'almost', 'too', 'obvious', 'two', 'people', 'can', 'love', 'one', 'same', 'way', 'thus', 'proving', 'point', 'true', 'form', 'love', 'reciprocated.Sobering', 'know.In', '2046', 'once', 'again', 'follow', 'character', 'Chow', 'Mo-wan', 'thankfully', 'played', 'once', 'again', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'film', 'place', 'few', 'years', 'affairs', 'recorded', 'Mood', 'Love', 'time', 'focusing', 'Chow', 'affairs', 'number', 'women', '2046', 'hotel', 'room', 'number', 'first', 'see', 'room', 'when', 'Chow', 'old', 'acquaintance', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'later', 'stabbed', 'jealous', 'boyfriend', 'whim', 'Chow', 'rent', 'out', 'room', 'only', 'take', 'room', '2047', 'next', 'few', 'years', 'room', '2046', 'somewhat', 'symbol', 'Chow', 'determination', 'find', 'love', 'interactions', 'three', 'women', 'card', 'shark', 'named', 'Black', 'Widow', 'landlord', 'daughter', 'Wang', 'Jing-wen', 'beautiful', 'prostitute', 'named', 'Bai', 'Ling', 'discover', 'many', 'sides', 'Chow', 'also', 'root', 'film.No', 'two', 'loves', 'are', 'same', 'thus', 'love', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'reciprocated.2046', 'thus', 'focal', 'point', 'work', 'fiction', 'Chow', 'reflect', 'own', 'emotional', 'feelings', '2046', 'year', 'year', 'where', 'everything', 'same', 'year', 'where', 'many', 'people', 'travel', 'regain', 'lost', 'memories', '2046', 'love', 'Chow', 'felt', 'Su', 'Li-zhen', 'love', 'portrayed', 'Maggie', 'Cheung', 'Mood', 'Love', 'found', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'be', 'truly', 'effective', 'also', 'found', 'be', 'canvas', 'female', 'co-stars', 'painted', 'elaborate', 'pictures', 'self', 'expression', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Faye', 'Wong', 'brilliant', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'were', 'phenomenal', 'here', 'Zhang', 'especially', 'sorts', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'here', 'shame', 'performance', 'getting', 'sorts', 'Oscar', 'awards', 'buzz', 'year', 'was', 'weaker', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'performance', 'Here', 'utterly', 'astonishing', 'carrying', 'emotional', 'cavity', 'character', 'losing', 'flirtatious', 'quality', 'made', 'mysteriously', 'engaging', 'Wong', 'also', 'own', 'VERY', 'well', 'creating', 'woman', 'who', 'young', 'nave', 'yet', 'enticing', 'Li', 'always', 'marvelous', 'what', 'here', 'such', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'unforgettable', 'breakdown', 'wall', 'OMG', '.While', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', '2046', 'as', 'strong', 'Mood', 'Love', 'must', 'say', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'films', 'burning', 'desire', 'amplifies', 'luscious', 'sequences', 'burn', 'minds', 'Director', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'stylistic', 'approach', 'work', 'full', 'effect', 'here', 'unforgettable', 'imagery', 'perfectly', 'emotional', 'gravity', 'story.Pain', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'inviting']",N/A

933808,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B000AVFLX0,Dennis Littrell,"[5, 6]","Chinese film maker Wong Kar Wai weaves a stylish web of romance and fantasy in this somewhat disjointed story about a writer whose fiction begins where his life leaves off--or vice versa.  Starring Tony Leung, who played Broken Sword in Yimou Zhang's Hero (2002), as Chow Mo Wan, the writer, and Ziyi Zhang as Bai Ling, the vulnerable and gorgeous prostitute, ""Two Oh Four Six"" mystifies as it beguiles.  Worth watching just as eye candy and to hear the music in the background, 2046 appropriately enough moves between Hong Kong and Singapore, two great Asian economic tigers, and then into the future which will be (let's face it folks) Chinese, very Chinese.This is the first of Wong Kar Wai's films that I have seen.  He reminds me a little of Yimou Zhang in that he strives for beauty in his production, in the sets, the scenes and the costumes.  His interiors are darker than Zhang's and his scenes are more cosmopolitan, and unlike Zhang he does not aim to make any kind of social statement.  There's a touch of American film noir in his story that focuses on Chow, the existential man who makes his living by writing newspaper articles and mass market fiction while meeting and pleasing the ladies, especially the ladies of the evening.  Tony Leung's easy charm and confident manner make him a natural for the part, an deeply introspective man who likes the night life.  I thought it was interesting--and maybe this is just me--that he looked a bit like Clark Gable with that thin moustache and surefooted way with women.Ziyi Zhang is fascinating to watch, but so are the other actresses, including Li Gong who has a modest part as Su Li Zhen, prostitute turned professional gambler, and Jie Dong and Faye Wong who play different aspects of Wang Jie Wen.  The sense I get from Chow's point of view is a succession of beautiful women moving before his eyes and in his memory, women he had loved but somehow never possessed.  As he says, ""Love is all a matter of timing.  It's no good meeting the right person too late or too soon.""One of the ideas touched upon here is that of the android lover.  I have little doubt that once humans are able to create life-like androids or robots, one of the first enterprises will be to make them experts at pleasing people sexually.  Another idea is that of impermanence, of time as our master, of time as fickle and malevolent with change as our enemy.  Everybody wants to go to 2046 and never return because nothing ever changes in 2046.  Or so it is said because nobody really knows since nobody ever returned from 2046--except Chow.  We can guess he returned to find somebody in the past, to recapture something he missed.In this way, Wong Kar Wai plays with time and human emotions.  The result is a gorgeous movie that transcends cultures and leaves the viewer wondering what is real and what is make believe.  Here's a question, where is that country from which no one returns?  Is such a place a metaphor?  And for what?  Here it is from Shakespeare's Hamlet: ""The undiscover'd country from whose bourn/No traveler returns...""

""2046"" is a hotel room number, which for the hero, Chow, encapsulates his lost love, as it unfolded in the prequel to this movie, ""In the Mood for Love."" Here, ""2046"" also becomes a year to which one can travel by a time-machine type of train, a year in which it is believed people can recapture their lost memories. The film consists of the hero, who has loved and lost, going through a series of encounters with women, who in their turn have loved and lost. Throughout his series of experiences with women, he is in fact only looking for his lost love, Su Lizhen, but he can never refind her.This is a rough, simplified plot synopsis, but the movie is much more complex than this, and it requires repeated viewings to enhance understanding. The repeated viewings are extremely rewarding, as this film is one of those art objects from which the viewer can draw new insights with each reexperiencing of it.The cinematography is beautiful, and the musical score is absolutely superb and moving, underscoring the emotions felt by the characters. The music is designed to enhance our experience of each scene and to intensify emotion. Granted, the film is not an easy one to follow. Personally, I felt confused at times, especially on a first viewing. But at such moments you can just let yourself go with the emotion carried through image and sound.""2046"" rewards us with a beautiful and talented cast. I really enjoyed watching all the actresses that paraded on screen, among them Zhang Ziyi, of ""Hero"" and ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,"" Gong Li, Carina Lau, Faye Wong and Maggie Cheung, all of them giving superb performances.As other reviewers have noted, it is not mandatory to see the prequel ""In the Mood for Love"" to understand ""2046,"" but it is well worth it, as there are many symbols from the previous film repeated in this one, and a scene where Su Lizhen reappears in Chow's memory. Personally, I liked ""2046"" better.Finally, I have to add that this film, though from my point of view amazing, is certainly not for everyone. If you prefer a straightforward storyline and a plot where things are happening all the time, then this film is not for you. This film emphasizes emotional experience at the expense of plot.

933812,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000AVFLX0,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 6]","Like Fernando Meirelles, Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai comes up with visually arresting, highly kinetic films that strike emotional chords with audiences that transcend individual cultures. What strikes me most about this 2004 film is the feverish sexual energy that Wong generates throughout, even though the narrative ellipses in the story can frequently be frustrating to track. In sharing the same central character, struggling writer Chow Mo-wan, the movie is a partial sequel to Wong's acclaimed 2000 film, ""In the Mood for Love"", picking up Chow several months later in the same Hong Kong hotel after his sojourn to Cambodia. However, it really isn't critical you see the earlier film before this one.Chow is a significantly changed man, rather embittered and far more misogynistic than before but haunted by memories far deeper than the failed love affair of the first movie.  Chow initially hopes to rent the very same room (2046), but since it's not ready for occupancy, he settles for the one next door (2047). Not only does the room 2046 become elusive to Chow, but it becomes the imagined, futuristic destination in Chow's science-fiction story where people can search for their lost memories. There is yet a third meaning to the number, as it is also the year when control of Hong Kong will fully revert back to mainland China. Wong encompasses this numerical device by cleverly going back and forth between Chow's affairs with several beautiful women and scenes from his invented sci-fi story in which a man finds himself falling for an android stewardess. The multi-layering story structure is a high-wire move for Wong, especially when the film opens confusingly with a Japanese narrator. In fact, various characters speak Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese to each other with perfect comprehension. Most -though not all - the pieces coalesce by the end, but the journey there is worthwhile with some truly memorable sequences.Same as the first film, Tony Leung Chiu Wai plays Chow but this time, plays him as a world-weary, predatory philanderer in the way Bogart or Gable did in the 1940's, an emotional cipher indifferent to the women he meets as he is convalescing from the failure of finding his one true love. Although Maggie Cheung comes back from the first film in a wordless cameo, Wong has recruited four of China's leading actresses to play the women who come in and out of Chow's world - Gong Li as Su Li Zhen, the mysterious gambler from Singapore who wears one black glove and the coincidental namesake of Chow's love; Carina Lau as Lulu, the mouthy prostitute; Faye Wong as Wang Jing Wen, the eldest daughter of Chow's landlord, as well as an almost anime-looking robotic object of desire in the sci-fi story; and Ziyi Zhang as Bai Ling, the upscale Hong Kong dance hostess conflicted about her feelings.All four actresses make vivid impressions, although unsurprisingly, Li and Zhang stand out in roles that are almost the polar opposites of their respective roles in Rob Marshall's ""Memoirs of a Geisha"". With her luxuriant beehive and pensive manner, Li bristles with pained passion, especially in her farewell scene. Zhang displays the unbridled sexual energy and open-hearted regret required for her role. As Wang Jing Wen's boyfriend and the protagonist of the sci-fi story, red-haired Takuya Kimura makes his moments count. Mixing imagery that recalls ""Blade Runner"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and Japanese anime, the computer graphics of the sci-fi sequences are impressively rendered by a French special effects company, BUF. The best sequences, however, take place in 1960's Hong Kong where Wong captures the tawdriness and eroticism of the atmosphere with fierce authority on a muted palette of vibrant colors. This is audacious filmmaking, but a greater focus on the story structure could have really helped.The DVD package surprisingly has no ongoing audio commentary from the filmmaker, which I think would have been helpful given the narrative ellipses in the story. As compensation, there is an illuminating 30-minute making-of featurette, which includes interviews with Wong and most of the principal cast except Li. There are additional interviews with Leung and Wong, who speak fluent English, as well as Zhang who is subtitled. As part of his creative process, Wong doesn't work with a final script, and each provides an in-depth analysis how it worked and often frustrated the actors, a particular challenge for Zhang who never worked with Wong before. Their comments also help explain the idiosyncratic casting and the motivation for key scenes, such as the significance of Chow paying a restaurant bill for Bai and himself in ten-dollar bills. Also included is a short on the genesis of the computer animation. Additionally, there are two deleted scenes, both intriguing, and a very brief alternate ending that makes an attempt to merge the two stories. There is also an excellent feature which focuses on the film's diverse music and of course, previews for other from Sony Pictures Classics.",4,"Audacious, Vibrant Filmmaking Drives and Meanders Though

933814,A2F5PAC9I5SCG6,B000AVFLX0,Ernest Jagger,"[5, 7]","Director Wong Kar Wai's film, ""2046"" is different if anything. I was not really sure what to make of the film when I first viewed it a few years ago. And after viewing it again tonight, I am not really sure if I would want to see it again. That is not to say that others will not find something in the film that appeals to them. The first time I viewed the film I had a difficult time with it. However, on second viewing, I was a bit bored. For me, the film was one of those you can watch once, maybe even twice, but that's about it. Or maybe it's the mood one is in? However, it is not a bad film, and if anything it will appeal to some viewers. What I did like about this film is that it is definitely a departure from so many other films out there---and especially films from Asia. And I hope the trend continues.There are some very good reviews of this film, and I will not rehash what has already been written by others--and much more eloquently I might add. The films narrative begins with what appears to be a futuristic world. With the use of CGI, there are trains darting back and forth. Here the narration sets the tone of the film, by relating how one can go on a journey to a distant place in order to recapture lost memories. The films protagonist, and voyager, is named Chow (Tony Leung). Chow is captivated by an era that holds many memories for him--and especially the memory of a woman long ago. Moreover, Chow lets the viewer know that he is the only one who has ever been back. No others have ever returned.The film highlights the mid 1960s; an era that Chow remembers fondly. This is also an era I grew up in as a young boy, and I thought that the director did a very good job with this particular part of the film. It was almost as if one is transported through time: as both the costumes, music, and entire atmosphere of the films period were great. But while I thought that this was done very well, I did not think the plot or the script was very good. The film moved at an extremely slow pace. Not that I dislike slow paced films if they are going somewhere---I just found this part of the film bothersome. Chow remembers fondly of the 1960s, and especially of a place where he lived called the ""Oriental Hotel"" in Hong Kong.Chow is a ladies man, and this is made clear in the film. In the film he portrays a writer who wishes to live in room 2046, where his memories of one woman in particular are strong. However, the manager informs him that the room is not available at the present time: For it has not been cleaned up. The manager offers Chow another room instead. Chow will eventually rent room 2047, across the hall, and wait for when the room becomes available, if at all. The film is partly an erotic story of the interaction between Chow and other women in the film, and mainly a prostitute (Ziyi Zhang). Yet, it is also about the story of a mysterious woman who once lived in the room that (Ziyi Zhang) is now renting.Moreover, as Chow is writing his own science-fiction story, he has interactions with other women whom he meets in the hotel. He even has a bizarre fixation on the hotel managers daughter, who is in love with a Japanese man. All the while, he is in the 1960s, yet also in the future, and at other times in the present. The film moves periodically back and forth from the 1960s and to the future and the present again. There were many scenes in the film that had a noirish feel to it: The 1960s for example. And while I do not think that this is a bad film, I did not think it was a great film either. It falls somewhere in between. Once again, the film will appeal to some viewers, and not others. I would not discourage others from viewing the film, however, before purchasing the film, I would recommend that viewers rent the film first.",3,Interesting Film: Will Appeal To Some!,1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,3791,"['Director', 'Wong', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'film', '2046', 'different', 'anything', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'when', 'first', 'viewed', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'viewing', 'again', 'tonight', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'would', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'not', 'say', 'others', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'something', 'film', 'appeals', 'first', 'time', 'viewed', 'film', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'However', 'second', 'viewing', 'was', 'bit', 'bored', 'film', 'was', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'once', 'maybe', 'even', 'twice', 'mood', 'one', 'However', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'anything', 'will', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'What', 'did', 'like', 'film', 'definitely', 'departure', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'there', '-and', 'especially', 'films', 'Asia', 'hope', 'trend', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'reviews', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'rehash', 'what', 'already', 'been', 'written', 'others', 'much', 'more', 'eloquently', 'might', 'add', 'films', 'narrative', 'begins', 'what', 'be', 'futuristic', 'world', 'use', 'CGI', 'are', 'trains', 'darting', 'back', 'forth', 'Here', 'narration', 'tone', 'film', 'relating', 'how', 'one', 'can', 'go', 'journey', 'distant', 'place', 'order', 'recapture', 'lost', 'memories', 'films', 'protagonist', 'voyager', 'named', 'Chow', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Chow', 'captivated', 'era', 'many', 'memories', 'especially', 'memory', 'woman', 'long', 'ago', 'Moreover', 'Chow', 'viewer', 'know', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'back', 'No', 'others', 'have', 'ever', 'returned.The', 'film', 'highlights', 'mid', '1960s', 'era', 'Chow', 'fondly', 'also', 'era', 'grew', 'up', 'young', 'boy', 'thought', 'director', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'particular', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'one', 'transported', 'time', 'costumes', 'music', 'entire', 'atmosphere', 'films', 'period', 'were', 'great', 'thought', 'was', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'plot', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'moved', 'extremely', 'slow', 'pace', 'Not', 'dislike', 'slow', 'paced', 'films', 'are', 'going', 'somewhere', '-I', 'just', 'found', 'part', 'film', 'bothersome', 'Chow', 'fondly', '1960s', 'especially', 'place', 'where', 'lived', 'called', 'Oriental', 'Hotel', 'Hong', 'Kong.Chow', 'ladies', 'man', 'made', 'clear', 'film', 'film', 'writer', 'who', 'live', 'room', '2046', 'where', 'memories', 'one', 'woman', 'particular', 'are', 'strong', 'However', 'manager', 'room', 'not', 'available', 'present', 'time', 'not', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'manager', 'Chow', 'room', 'instead', 'Chow', 'will', 'eventually', 'rent', 'room', '2047', 'hall', 'wait', 'when', 'room', 'available', 'film', 'partly', 'erotic', 'story', 'interaction', 'Chow', 'other', 'women', 'film', 'mainly', 'prostitute', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'also', 'story', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'who', 'once', 'lived', 'room', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'now', 'renting.Moreover', 'Chow', 'writing', 'own', 'science-fiction', 'story', 'interactions', 'other', 'women', 'whom', 'hotel', 'even', 'bizarre', 'fixation', 'hotel', 'managers', 'daughter', 'who', 'love', 'Japanese', 'man', 'while', '1960s', 'yet', 'also', 'future', 'other', 'times', 'present', 'film', 'periodically', 'back', 'forth', '1960s', 'future', 'present', 'again', 'were', 'many', 'scenes', 'film', 'had', 'noirish', 'feel', '1960s', 'example', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'bad', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'somewhere', 'Once', 'again', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'not', 'others', 'would', 'not', 'discourage', 'others', 'viewing', 'film', 'however', 'purchasing', 'film', 'would', 'recommend', 'viewers', 'rent', 'film', 'first']",N/A

But within this we have the dealings of what 2046 which is a novel being written. While the focus is of love within that novel, we are set in this hyper-futuristic tale that characters travel to the future to regain lost memories.It's a story that is fascinating both inside and outside of the novel that is being made. One that shows that people as a whole, don't like change. They have problems with moving on and perhaps in their hearts have always lost the ones they really loved. And as is the way with things, people try to get along with their lives whether they fully realize this or not. In a sense they want to go back to how things were before because they might want to recapture that spark the relationship once had or recapture the youth they once had as they feel themselves getting older and closer to their inevitable demise.But before I make this sound like it's one of those depressing love stories to rival the likes of Verhoeven's adaptation of Jan Wolkers' Turkish Delight, I should tell them to relax, it's not like that at all. It has it's bittersweet melancholy but the tone is more wistful, than the overbearing suffocation of Turkish Delight. In locating it in Hong Kong of the 1960s, it shows that Hong Kong was still a thing of beauty and still ahead of it's time. In many respects, it's architecture is something some of the developed countries still aspire to and have been playing catch up ever since.But it's the scenes of the future, or the future imagined for the novel that's been written which really captivates the eye. The colours, the textures make this film glorious viewing for the viewer. I can't even begin to describe, how intricate and how colourful it really looks.....I'd almost say it takes on a life of it's own.

933816,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000AVFLX0,Grady Harp,"[5, 7]","Kar Wai Wong is more than a film director (though he is one of the finest directors working today!): he is a visual, poetic, creative and daring artist capable of more cinematic miracles in one isolated film than most directors achieve in a lifetime.  '2046' is a visually stunning, intellectually challenging, emotionally charged view of love and lust in today's kinetically dysfunctional society.There is no one way to interpret this non-linear film and therein lies much of its rewards.  The main character Chow (Tony Leung) is a writer and a libertine who has pushed his vacuous life around with his hormones and though he has had many affairs he has failed to find the illusory 'love'.  He has lived in Singapore and Hong Kong, makes his living writing columns of newspapers while his novels formulate in his mind.  One of his novels is called '2046', the title based on the room number in a hotel where he witnessed a bizarre incident involving a gorgeous woman, and resulted in his moving into the adjoining room 2047 where is meets the hotel manager's daughter in love with a Filipino Japanese man her father loathes.  He desires this unattainable woman and fuses her with a fictional 'android' in his novel which now uses '2046' as a year or time or place where people go to find memories.  He continues to encounter women for whom he desires more than surface relationships (there is a stunning lady gambler cameo who represents everything he lusts and longs for, etc) but he is never able to find his tenuous ideal: his memory is his only source of consolation.The actors in every role include many of the finest actors available: Li Gong, Ziyi Zhang, Carina Lau, Maggie Cheung, Takuya Kimura, Chen Chang, and of course Tony Leung.  But it is Kar Wai Wong, the writer, director, choreographer, colorist, visionary that makes this excursion into the interstices of the mind/imagination so overwhelmingly satisfying.  Whether the viewer elects to view the story as a continyation of the director's previous films, or as reality vs memory, fiction vs imagination, sci-fi excursion, or simply a plethora of vignettes about the challenges of finding love in a world geared toward instant gratification, this is a magnificent achievement.  In many ways the sound track could be turned off (though the beautiful musical score by  Peer Raben and Shigeru Umebayashi with a lot of help from Maria Callas! would be missed), and the inventive cinematography and visual image manipulations by Christopher Doyle, Pung-Leung Kwan and Yiu-Fai Lai such as the constant dividing of the screen into triptychs and diptychs would remain some of the most beautiful photographic images on film.This is not an easy film to follow and it is most assuredly one that will grow in importance with repeated viewings. The comparison with Alain Resnais' 'Last Year at Marienbad' suggests its potency. But free the mind and enter into the world of '2046' for one of the most satisfying cinematic achievements of the recent past.  Very highly recommended.

Yet, I think this one is still my favorite.  It's one of those films that sort of 'creeps' up on you.  Before you know it, the film is done, but the story stays with you... and then you end up wanting to watch it again.  This film will be especially of interest to those who have a slightly more eccentric taste in films.  Don't get me wrong, it's not overtly bizzare, it's just different than your 'run-of-the-mill' storyline.  Some will complain that the plot is difficult to follow, or even incoherent.  It helps, however, if you've seen ""In the Mood for Love,"" and I also took the time to watch some of the special features where Wong Kar Wai discusses the process of making the film and his desired intention in creating it.  I found both the special features and the follow-up viewing of ""In the Mood for Love"" interesting and helpful.  Overall though, I simply enjoyed the tone and mood of the film.  I feel that many 'Western' films often sacrifice the art of subtlety  in order to focus on heavily plot driven stories.

933819,A1RMWCN45F0PF9,B000AVFLX0,"J. A. Eyon ""Little Raven""","[2, 5]","Here's what you might want to know:Visuals: With Wong Kar Wai, always start with the visuals. Here's another collaboration with cinematographer Christopher Doyle that has resulted in a film of stunning visual beauty. Rich colors (unlike Hollywood productions) - striking compositions - all in service of the drama.Story: This story of a Hong Kong playboy and the unfortunate women who are drawn to him is very bleak and fatalistic. The pacing of this move is slow, typical with Wong Kar Wai. Atypically, this one relies heavily on flashbacks to complete the story. Plus, there is a fantasy sub-story (the main character is writing a scifi story) which I found of no value to the main part of the movie.Characterization: Some characters aren't well-developed, and their inclusion in the fantasy part doesn't add anything. Faye Wong mostly mopes around while looking very pretty. Gong Li looked glamourous but offered little beyond pessimism and mystery.Acting: Some roles in this movie are flimsy and not the actors' fault. My favorite performance belongs to Zhang Ziyi. Her's happens to be the best written and most sympathetic role in the film. But that lovely & lively sprite of an actress added facets and power. Mustachioed Tony Leung perfectly personifies the confident and uncaring ladies man.Music: Like Stanley Kubrick, this film is full of scenes where the music is as important as any character. Funnily, it's almost all Western music altho it is set in Hong Kong. Some Classical, some Nat King Cole, some Xavier Cugat.Note: This movie is actually a recycling of two of his previous films:DAYS OF BEING WILDandIN THE MOOD FOR LOVE.

He finds himself in the same hotel, if not the same room, with a new set of relationships which are much more fluid in nature.  While he cannot commit himself to any one woman, he does seem to find some solace in the landlord's daughter, who helps him write a sci-fiction serial entitled 2046, where all time seems to have come to a standstill and he sublimates his love in androids.  Not even the lovely Bai Ling (Ziyi Zhang) can stir Chow from his fantasies.

And since this was a follow-up to his marvellous film ""In the Mood for Love"", which ties into the world founded in his elliptical, perplexing 1990 masterpiece ""Days of Being Wild"", the anticipation was high...Unfortunately, ""2046"" represents a kind of self-implosion for Wong, whose films have always been stubborn in cutting their own path in the face of audience needs and expectations. Now, when he was making films like ""Chungking Express"", which is a film purely for film lovers, he alienated the mainstream while hitting chords with the cine-literate folk who had not had their pretentiousness fed in such ways since the heights of Godard. But ""2046"" sees the man who was once the most exciting film-maker in the world stray into David Lynch territory - not in terms of style, but the fact that he has finally fallen into making a pretentious film for pretentious people.""2046"" carries the familiar meditations on lost love and emotional masochism and detachment that are the staples of all of Wong's previous films, but the deliberately confusing structure make this blend of period drama and surreal sci-fi more frustrating than the joyous puzzles he usually presents. In distancing the audience so profoundly, Wong draws attention to the fact that his film is glorifying in its own triumph and importance.It not only leaves you cold, but furthermore, it results in a film that fades from the memory extremely quickly - not a charge to be aimed at any previous Wong Kar-wai film. The main character, Chow, is a writer and womanizer. The story is told out of sequence, with past and present jumbled. In a clever use of irony, we gradually understand that the future is being used to tell the past. Some scenes are presented early, in a way that is confusing until the context is presented later. There are 3 female characters who are in his life, and the story is segmented accordingly.The cinematography is beautiful. Interestingly, Wong uses 3 colors nearly exclusively: Blood red, sea green, and yellow. Sometimes he will use light to make those colors stand out, other times it is the objects themselves which are in that color.

933825,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B000AVFLX0,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 3]","Wong Kar-Wai's films center on human relationships, rather than the action films of many other Hong Kong directors.  He won a Best Director award from Cannes for ""Happy Together.""  ""2046"" is a good film to see some of China's most beautiful actresses.  Gong Li plays the Black Spider and fills each screen moment with passion and depth.  She played in ""Zhou Yu's Train"" and recently was the jealous geisha in ""Memoirs of a Geisha.""  It will be interesting to see her in the American ""Miami Vice"" movie.  Tony Leung's character Chow Mo Wan is apparently in love with her, but director Wong Kar-Wai spends a limited amount of screentime with the relationship.  As Bai Ling, the prostitute who lives in room 2046, Zhang Ziyi who starred in ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is one of cinema's most beautiful stars.  Her performance here is stellar as she teases, taunts, and craves Leung.  Faye Wong plays the hotel owner's daughter Wang Jingwen who pines for a Japanese lover that her father will not accept.  She becomes writer Chow Mo Wan's right hand.  The film splinters somewhat as the writer played by Leung constructs a story about a futuristic city where people go to find pleasure and from which they never return.  Takuya Kimura plays the Japanese guy that tries to coax romance from android robots on the train to 2046.  The cinematography in the film is exquisite, as each shot seems like the set up of a painting.  The theme of the picture is open ended, being much more an exploration of modern relationships than the telling of a romantic story.  Leung doesn't seem to ever find true love; and the fact that he's often not a very nice guy seems to predict the outcome.  After watching the film, I felt more as if I had had a cinematic experience rather than I had watched a coherent story.  Maybe life is like that sometimes.

933827,AAW58LG72PG7I,B000AVFLX0,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[0, 0]","For the typical American audience, 2046 can be a puzzle.  Americans tend to like their movies the way they like their novels, with a straight line progression of plot.  For those who can allow themselves the luxury of going with the flow, 2046 is a stunning achievement.  What this film does is to present more of a mood, spliced with wispy tendrils of thought that ebb and flow in both temporal directions.  Tony Leung is Chow, a Chinese author who writes what he considers second rate soft core porn.  He dreams of a mysterious land called 2046, which, in this film, is the room which, because of tragic memories, resonates with equally tragic yet frequently impish overtones.  His stories are full of tormented souls, much presumably like himself, who need to escape the unhappiness of the past by seeking in the present a key to the future. He peoples his characters as passengers on a train, some of whom have sex with automatons who resemble previous lovers.  Part of the joy of 2046 lies in the audience's task of distinguishing life on the train from life in Chow's daily existence.  Chow is a drinker, a gambler, and an inveterate womanizer, who nonetheless possesses a spark of decency that forbids him from taking sexual advantage of teenage girls who throw themselves at him. His life is a montage of regrets, beginning with a  prostitute who may or may not be the same girl from his past.  He courts her but sets some basic rules: their relationship will be platonic until she wills otherwise, and if and when she wishes sex, then their relation can be neither serious nor permanent.  She agrees, but when she falls in love with him, he stuns her by adhering to their original agreement.  In strolls another girl (Maggie Cheung); this one is the daughter of his landlord. She loves a Japanese but her father hates all Japanese and forbids her to see him.  Chow falls in love with her but refuses to even try to get physical.  Chow even helps her to marry her Japanese boyfriend. Enter the third female (Gong Li), known as the Spider Woman, who helps him to regain losses suffered in a casino.  Throughout these temporally floating affairs, Chow keeps himself aloof from a too deep attachment.  He may fall in love with one or more women, but he refuses himself the luxury of becoming overly emotionally dependent on any.  The filming style does not ever sink into a raw herky-jerky morass of illogic. By the time Chow goes through his last woman, he teaches himself the valuable lesson that regardless of how much one woman may have meant to him either in his murky realm of 2046 or in his even murkier real life, he can never go home again.  All that he and presumably the ones reading his cheap stories or watching this masterpiece can do would be to press on and face the next challenge, which in his case is to chain smoke as he awaits a woman who reminds him of yet an earlier version of herself.",5,2046: Visuals Over Plot,1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,2914,"['typical', 'American', 'audience', '2046', 'can', 'be', 'puzzle', 'Americans', 'tend', 'like', 'movies', 'way', 'like', 'novels', 'straight', 'line', 'progression', 'plot', 'who', 'can', 'allow', 'luxury', 'going', 'flow', '2046', 'stunning', 'achievement', 'What', 'film', 'present', 'more', 'mood', 'spliced', 'wispy', 'tendrils', 'thought', 'ebb', 'flow', 'temporal', 'directions', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Chow', 'Chinese', 'author', 'who', 'what', 'second', 'rate', 'soft', 'core', 'porn', 'mysterious', 'land', 'called', '2046', 'film', 'room', 'tragic', 'memories', 'equally', 'tragic', 'yet', 'frequently', 'impish', 'overtones', 'stories', 'are', 'full', 'tormented', 'souls', 'much', 'presumably', 'who', 'need', 'escape', 'unhappiness', 'past', 'seeking', 'present', 'key', 'future', 'characters', 'passengers', 'train', 'whom', 'have', 'sex', 'automatons', 'who', 'resemble', 'previous', 'lovers', 'Part', 'joy', '2046', 'lies', 'audience', 'task', 'distinguishing', 'life', 'train', 'life', 'Chow', 'daily', 'existence', 'Chow', 'drinker', 'gambler', 'inveterate', 'womanizer', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'spark', 'decency', 'taking', 'sexual', 'advantage', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'throw', 'life', 'montage', 'regrets', 'beginning', 'prostitute', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'same', 'girl', 'past', 'basic', 'rules', 'relationship', 'will', 'be', 'platonic', 'otherwise', 'when', 'sex', 'then', 'relation', 'can', 'be', 'neither', 'serious', 'permanent', 'when', 'love', 'adhering', 'original', 'agreement', 'strolls', 'girl', 'Maggie', 'Cheung', 'one', 'daughter', 'landlord', 'Japanese', 'father', 'Japanese', 'see', 'Chow', 'love', 'even', 'try', 'get', 'physical', 'Chow', 'even', 'marry', 'Japanese', 'boyfriend', 'Enter', 'third', 'female', 'Gong', 'Li', 'known', 'Spider', 'Woman', 'who', 'regain', 'losses', 'suffered', 'casino', 'temporally', 'floating', 'affairs', 'Chow', 'too', 'deep', 'attachment', 'may', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'more', 'women', 'luxury', 'becoming', 'overly', 'emotionally', 'dependent', 'filming', 'style', 'not', 'ever', 'sink', 'raw', 'herky-jerky', 'morass', 'illogic', 'time', 'Chow', 'last', 'woman', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'regardless', 'how', 'much', 'one', 'woman', 'may', 'have', 'meant', 'either', 'murky', 'realm', '2046', 'even', 'murkier', 'real', 'life', 'can', 'never', 'go', 'home', 'again', 'presumably', 'ones', 'reading', 'cheap', 'stories', 'watching', 'masterpiece', 'can', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'press', 'face', 'next', 'challenge', 'case', 'chain', 'smoke', 'woman', 'who', 'yet', 'earlier', 'version', 'herself']",N/A

She ends up winning, and the game then comes to the present. The movie spends a good deal of it's time going between reality and the fictional world he's created, while dropping hints about the woman from the beginning until at the end and after a relationship with a prostitute (Ziyi Zang) we find out that the woman from the beginning is the only woman he'll ever want, and that's why he chose to write ""2046"". It could have been so much better but it has a tendency to drag and often switch without any good transition between past, present and the story.

I was recently browsing the foreign movie section of my local library and when I saw this, I couldn't resist picking it up. Glad I did.""2046"" (2004 release from Hong Kong; 129 min.) brings a number of seperate story arcs that are being played out in a non-traditional manner and at times in a non-chronological sequence. The central figure in the story is a man named Chow. Chow has conceived of a world in which people can travel to the year 2046 to recapture lost lives and find loved ones. Few return from 2046. Chow is also seen interacting with various women in a hotel in Hong Kong, in 1966-67. He is particularly fixated on room 2046, which seems to house a subsequent number of mysterious (and attractive) women. To tell you much more about the plot, such as it is, would be to ruin your viewing experiecen, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost: if you think or expect this is a sci-fi movie, by all means, dave yourself the trouble, as there are just a few traces of sci-fi, and the rest of human relationship obervations (set in tle late 1960s no less). Second, this is complex movie viewing, due to the several story arc, but ultimately very rewarding. Third, the movie soundtrack is simply outstanding, with original music from composer Shigeru Umebayashi supplemented by a smorgasbord of 1960s music includig songs from Connie Francis, Dean Martin, Nat King Cole, etc. Just superb.

933831,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B000AVFLX0,Paul McGrath,"[43, 46]","As a young college student many years ago, I took a film class as a kind of lark and to fulfill some requirement or other.  It was pretty much a waste of time.  There was one camera to go around among twenty students, so we each got about a week with the thing and hardly anybody got anything done.  The one good thing was that we got to see some avant-garde films.  They were real eye-openers, in that film, to me, had pretty much always been a depiction of a linear story line with a beginning, middle, climax and end.  The avant-garde films we watched rarely had any kind of a story line at all, but despite this the better ones were still able to elicit a satisfying emotional or intellectual response.The first thing you have to remember when you watch 2046 is that there is not a conventional story line here.  In fact, the haphazard nature of the film's scenes--past, present, future, imagined and ""real""--don't even make sense in their own illogical framework.  You have to know this going in because if you strain to make sense of the plot--as we have all been conditioned to do--you will miss the point.  Indeed, I had to watch this a couple of times.The film consists of a series of scenes primarily focusing on a Chinese writer named Chow.  He is in Singapore, and leaves a beautiful woman behind who may or may not have loved him.  He is in Hong Kong, and falls for another beautiful woman who is murdered in her hotel room.  He tells the hotel-keeper that he wishes to move into this room--2046--because he is evidently trying to return to this place in his mind and his heart.  Of course, he can't, literally or figuratively, so he is given the room next door.  He begins an affair with a prostitute who moves into 2046 and who loves him with every fiber of her being.  He uses her as a prostitute only.  He falls in love with the hotel-keeper's daughter who herself is in love with a distant Japanese man her father despises.  He writes a science-fiction piece--visualized in the film and entitled 2046--which is a story of the future and a train on which female androids serve one but with whom one must never fall in love, and on which he imagines himself to be Japanese.Ehh, no, this is not a coherent storyline.  The future is mixed with the past which is mixed with the present which is mixed with his story which is mixed up with his imagination.  In the end, it occurs that it is entirely possible that all of these women are the same person;  that they are simply some ideal of love he has concocted in his mind.  Maybe not.Visually, the film is a stunner.  Every scene, every backdrop, every set-piece is carefully and meticulously orchestrated.  Cigarette smoke drifting above a cluttered desk;  a beautifully-clothed female form asleep on a bed;  cards laid out on a green table in a dark restaurant:  you could paint these scenes and hang them in an art museum.  The framing device is also very artful.  It is constrained and prevents us from seeing what we want to see.  It is hard to comprehend.  More importantly, the attention that is being paid to these details and the beauty with which they are rendered concentrates the viewer's attention:  something incredibly important is going on.  This feeling is reinforced by the musical score--opera and classical mostly--which drifts in and out plaintively.The acting, from the smaller to the larger roles, is spectacular.  So much is going on beyond that which is said, and beyond that which is implied.  All of the actors and actresses are superb, but special mention must be paid to Ziyi Zheng, who plays the prostitute, and who burns a hole in the screen every time she appears on it.  She is an un-erupted volcano of barely restrained emotion:  thin, beautiful, lonely, sensual, and terribly, terribly sad.In the end, and without perhaps realizing it, we understand that the film works as a statement on the human condition, and the clumsy, random way we try to seek happiness in it.

933833,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000AVFLX0,Roland E. Zwick,"[12, 13]","***1/2The title of the film, ""2046,"" refers both to a time in the future and to a hotel room in the past.  Chow Mo Wan is a writer living in Hong Kong in the mid to late 1960's.  The hotel room he rents is right next door to Room 2046, whose various residents, all beautiful but troubled women, he observes and interacts with and puts into his fiction, a sci-fi story entitled ""2046,"" about a futuristic world in which people desperate for love and happiness journey to an unspecified place called 2046 where, we are told, love remains eternal and nothing ever changes.  Chow's literary work also reflects much of what he himself feels about women, love and relationships.  It's not always easy following the time shifts and parallel stories upon which this multi-level narrative is constructed, but ""2046"" is a mesmerizing film for anyone willing and open enough to give himself over to the experience.At the start, the film feels episodic and disjointed, as writer/director Kar Wai Wong reveals in gradual stages the complex story he is telling.  We can tell that this is a movie that will require our full and undivided attention if we hope to enter into the minds of the filmmakers and make any real sense at all out of it.  But after some initial confusion, most of the early ambiguity begins to fade away as the major themes and characters come to the fore.  Chow is a man who has clearly lost the love of his life and who has since been trying to come to terms with that fact in his later dealings with women.  He has made a decision - whether conscious or unconscious we are never really sure - to keep women at arm's length, being willing to bed or help them but not allowing himself to enter into any permanent or meaningful relationships with them.  Instead, he uses his writing to express those yearnings for true companionship that he cannot allow himself to act upon in real life.Unlike many Chinese films, which enact their tales against expansive landscapes bathed in glorious sunlight and vibrant colors, ""2046"" is set in a claustrophobic world of dingy rooms and darkened hallways, with the camera almost never journeying outdoors or even pulling very far back from the actors in the frame.  The effect of this is to plunge us fully into the world and minds of the characters, particularly that of Chow, whose thoughts and musings become the canvas on which the story is painted.  Tony Leung Chiu Wai gives a subtle, masterful performance as do the various actresses who play the women in his life.  It is his affair with Bai Ling, a beautiful prostitute who wants more out of their relationship than Chow is willing to give, that leaves the greatest mark on our heart.There are times when the movie seems almost too fancy and showy for its own good, when the simplicity of the theme gets buried under the complexity and artiness of the filmmaker's style.  But this is, for the most part, a challenging and stimulating work that moves us even when we don't fully understand it.",3,"moody sequel to ""In the Mood for Love""",1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,2995,"['***1/2The', 'title', 'film', '2046', 'time', 'future', 'hotel', 'room', 'past', 'Chow', 'Mo', 'Wan', 'writer', 'living', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'mid', 'late', '1960', 'hotel', 'room', 'right', 'next', 'door', 'Room', '2046', 'various', 'residents', 'beautiful', 'troubled', 'women', 'fiction', 'sci-fi', 'story', 'entitled', '2046', 'futuristic', 'world', 'people', 'desperate', 'love', 'happiness', 'journey', 'unspecified', 'place', 'called', '2046', 'where', 'are', 'told', 'love', 'eternal', 'nothing', 'ever', 'changes', 'Chow', 'literary', 'work', 'also', 'much', 'what', 'women', 'love', 'relationships', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'following', 'time', 'shifts', 'parallel', 'stories', 'multi-level', 'narrative', 'constructed', '2046', 'mesmerizing', 'film', 'anyone', 'willing', 'open', 'enough', 'give', 'experience.At', 'start', 'film', 'feels', 'episodic', 'disjointed', 'writer/director', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'reveals', 'gradual', 'stages', 'complex', 'story', 'telling', 'can', 'tell', 'movie', 'will', 'require', 'full', 'undivided', 'attention', 'hope', 'enter', 'minds', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'real', 'sense', 'initial', 'confusion', 'most', 'early', 'ambiguity', 'fade', 'away', 'major', 'themes', 'characters', 'come', 'fore', 'Chow', 'man', 'who', 'clearly', 'lost', 'love', 'life', 'who', 'been', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'fact', 'later', 'dealings', 'women', 'made', 'decision', 'conscious', 'unconscious', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'sure', 'keep', 'women', 'arm', 'length', 'being', 'willing', 'bed', 'help', 'not', 'allowing', 'enter', 'permanent', 'meaningful', 'relationships', 'Instead', 'writing', 'express', 'yearnings', 'true', 'companionship', 'can', 'not', 'allow', 'act', 'real', 'life.Unlike', 'many', 'Chinese', 'films', 'enact', 'tales', 'expansive', 'landscapes', 'bathed', 'glorious', 'sunlight', 'vibrant', 'colors', '2046', 'set', 'claustrophobic', 'world', 'dingy', 'rooms', 'darkened', 'hallways', 'camera', 'almost', 'never', 'journeying', 'outdoors', 'even', 'pulling', 'very', 'far', 'back', 'actors', 'frame', 'effect', 'plunge', 'fully', 'world', 'minds', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Chow', 'thoughts', 'musings', 'become', 'canvas', 'story', 'painted', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Chiu', 'Wai', 'subtle', 'masterful', 'performance', 'do', 'various', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'women', 'life', 'affair', 'Bai', 'Ling', 'beautiful', 'prostitute', 'who', 'more', 'relationship', 'Chow', 'willing', 'give', 'greatest', 'mark', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'movie', 'almost', 'too', 'fancy', 'showy', 'own', 'good', 'when', 'simplicity', 'theme', 'buried', 'complexity', 'artiness', 'filmmaker', 'style', 'most', 'part', 'challenging', 'stimulating', 'work', 'even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand']",N/A

This guy (Kar Wai Wong) is a visionary as a director.  He has a stunning eye, and I was totally in love with the visuals in the movie after the first five minutes.  I did watch the commentary features where they discussed that when the film was debuted at Cannes the special effects were not even completed, but the simple lines attracted Mr. Wong's eye and changes were made to incorporate more of this linear style for the final version of the film.  This is a film to be savored simply for its world construct, both present, past, and future.Secondly, the bad.  The plot was difficult to follow, and it will take multiple viewing to sort some of it out.  I first assumed the movie was set in the year 2046, and Tony Leung as Chow Mo Wan wanted to escape the boring present of that age by going back in time to the late 1960s.  Then I read that, no, the world of 2046 was actually just a science fiction story that the characters may or may not appear in, but definitely female androids/robots did exist (deliciously beautiful, I might add).  People come and go, a murder may or may not have happened, Tony Leung may be Chinese or he may morph into a Japanese character in 2046.  Additionally, the protagonist and/or his love interests tend to stay in hotels in rooms 2046 or 2047.  There's a woman who may be missing a hand, or maybe not, but either brings good luck, cheats, or has terrible luck herself.  Whew!Now, for the ugly.  Well, in a film this sumptuous, there really isn't any ugly at all.  There is a mysterious symbol that appears occasionally, sort of a big flower or fungus with perhaps a hole in the middle that one can peep through (there's a lot of spying going on in the film); maybe that's a bit odd, but not ugly.One last thing: kudos for the music in this film.  I'd love to have the soundtrack, as it wanders from original music to opera to classical to jazz to traditional tunes.  The atmosphere of the film would be diminished significantly without this score.There are several bonus features in the film including interviews with Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi, who plays the daughter of the hotel manager.  Those interviews helped explain the movie to me a bit.  There are also deleted scenes and an alternate ending which don't help clarify anything.I recommend this movie for those who love beautiful movies, and are not put off by the non-linear plot.  I enjoyed it, but for good or ill, it will take multiple viewings to make sense of the plot.",4,"The Good, the Bad, and the Well, there is no Ugly",1198368000,"12 23, 2007",2007,2659,"['did', ""n't"", 'want', 'film', 'end', '1', 'loved', 'visual', 'style', 'actors/actresses', 'film', '2', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'going', 'movie.First', 'good', 'guy', 'Kar', 'Wai', 'Wong', 'visionary', 'director', 'stunning', 'eye', 'was', 'totally', 'love', 'visuals', 'movie', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'did', 'watch', 'commentary', 'features', 'where', 'discussed', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'debuted', 'Cannes', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'not', 'even', 'completed', 'simple', 'lines', 'attracted', 'Mr.', 'Wong', 'eye', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'incorporate', 'more', 'linear', 'style', 'final', 'version', 'film', 'film', 'be', 'savored', 'simply', 'world', 'construct', 'present', 'past', 'future.Secondly', 'bad', 'plot', 'was', 'difficult', 'follow', 'will', 'take', 'multiple', 'viewing', 'sort', 'first', 'assumed', 'movie', 'was', 'set', 'year', '2046', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Chow', 'Mo', 'Wan', 'wanted', 'escape', 'boring', 'present', 'age', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'late', '1960s', 'Then', 'read', 'world', '2046', 'was', 'actually', 'just', 'science', 'fiction', 'story', 'characters', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'appear', 'definitely', 'female', 'androids/robots', 'did', 'exist', 'deliciously', 'might', 'add', 'come', 'go', 'murder', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'happened', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'may', 'be', 'Chinese', 'may', 'morph', 'Japanese', 'character', '2046', 'Additionally', 'protagonist', 'love', 'interests', 'tend', 'stay', 'hotels', 'rooms', '2046', '2047', 'woman', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'missing', 'hand', 'maybe', 'not', 'good', 'luck', 'cheats', 'terrible', 'luck', 'Whew', 'Now', 'ugly', 'Well', 'film', 'sumptuous', 'really', ""n't"", 'ugly', 'mysterious', 'symbol', 'occasionally', 'sort', 'big', 'flower', 'fungus', 'perhaps', 'hole', 'middle', 'one', 'can', 'peep', 'lot', 'spying', 'going', 'film', 'maybe', 'bit', 'odd', 'not', 'ugly.One', 'last', 'thing', 'kudos', 'music', 'film', ""'d"", 'love', 'have', 'soundtrack', 'original', 'music', 'opera', 'classical', 'jazz', 'traditional', 'tunes', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'diminished', 'significantly', 'are', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'film', 'including', 'interviews', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'who', 'daughter', 'hotel', 'manager', 'interviews', 'helped', 'explain', 'movie', 'bit', 'are', 'also', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'clarify', 'anything.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'love', 'beautiful', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'put', 'off', 'non-linear', 'plot', 'enjoyed', 'good', 'ill', 'will', 'take', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'make', 'sense', 'plot']",N/A

Zhang Ziyi, whose previous one-note petulant performances had me dreading her role here, actually is quite a revelation, showing an emotional range, vulnerability and likeability totally lacking in her previous films to have got western releases.It's not the exuberant Wong of Chungking Express or Fallen Angels, and the layered, sometimes ambivalently drifting nature of the film isn't to all tastes, but ultimately it hit more often than it missed for me.The extras package on this Sony release is particularly good - 2 long deleted scenes and a brief alternate ending, a 38-minute making of, and interview featurette with Wong Kar Wei, Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi, production featurette, although the absence of any of the film's trailers is surprising.",4,Wong Kar Wei at his best and worst,1142985600,"03 22, 2006",2006,1603,"['know', ""'m"", 'minority', 'here', '2046', 'impressed', 'more', 'Mood', 'Love', 'longeurs', 'flat', 'patches', 'may', 'be', 'blasphemy', 'most', 'Wong', 'Kar-Wei', 'fans', 'mixed', 'reception', 'did', ""n't"", 'encourage', 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'almost', 'sequel.It', 'not', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'probably', 'intentional', 'story', 'man', 'state', 'emotional', 'denial', 'excuses', 'selfishness', 'paint', 'purely', 'one', 'color', 'film', 'strength', 'character', 'changes', 'different', 'points', 'time', 'different', 'relationships', 'just', 'good', 'one', 'person', ""n't"", 'mean', 'bad', 'then', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'fact', 'gorgeous', 'Faye', 'Wong', 'just', 'out', 'best', 'men', 'sorry', 'was', 'drifting', 'off', 'subject', 'there', 'moment', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'previous', 'one-note', 'petulant', 'performances', 'had', 'dreading', 'role', 'here', 'actually', 'quite', 'revelation', 'showing', 'emotional', 'range', 'vulnerability', 'likeability', 'totally', 'lacking', 'previous', 'films', 'have', 'got', 'western', 'releases.It', 'not', 'exuberant', 'Wong', 'Chungking', 'Express', 'Fallen', 'Angels', 'layered', 'sometimes', 'ambivalently', 'drifting', 'nature', 'film', ""n't"", 'tastes', 'ultimately', 'hit', 'more', 'often', 'missed', 'me.The', 'extras', 'package', 'Sony', 'release', 'particularly', 'good', '2', 'long', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'brief', 'alternate', 'ending', '38-minute', 'making', 'interview', 'featurette', 'Wong', 'Kar', 'Wei', 'Tony', 'Leung', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'production', 'featurette', 'absence', 'film', 'trailers', 'surprising']",N/A
