712575,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00006F7IL,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 0]","Okay, blame it on Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters (including ""beatnik"" holdover bus driver Neal Cassady). Or blame it on a recently re-read of Tom Wolfe's classic ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test"" that pays ""homage"" to Kesey, his Pranksters, their psychedelically-painted bus ""Further"", and their various adventures and misadventures. Or, better, blame it on Jack Keroauc and that self-same central character Cassady (as Dean Moriarty)  for his ""On The Road"". Whatever it is I am in a kind of ""back to the future"" 1960s counter-cultural mood today. And what figure, at least in some senses, represented an aspect of that scene better than the late Dennis Hopper's character in the classic ""Easy Rider"". And with that introduction/justification as a prompt out of the way other Hooper efforts now come to mind, including this 1990 sent-up of some of the iconic figures of the 1960s, whether they deserved that status or not. Or whether, in some cases,  they deserved the sent-up either, come to think of it.In the character of Hopper's Huey Walker, of course, we have a prima facie case made out for us for not, as he self-admittedly points out, deserving that status.  It seems that the fugitive from the law Huey needs an angle to get his (probably) massive memoir published but needs a little  publicity hook to stir memories (and sales) from his demographic cohort (that means us, the 1960s us) . So naturally he ""snitches"" on himself.  The plot centers on gearing up the ante on that publicity value in the process of law enforcement trying to move Huey from point A to point B, by train no less.  To give Huey his just desserts and to cap off a fanciful recapture of the fugitive radical up steps  a child of the 1960s children (admirers of Huey) turned renegade FBI Agent ( Borden, aka Free, played by Sutherland) who, however, in end, after myriad hijinks, comical or otherwise, and a ""bonding' experience with wild man Walker finds his way back to his DNA core. It's in the genes, right?Along the way we are treated to sent-ups of everything the 1960s stood for, from those gaudily-painted buses to the antics or some rueful now middle- aged ""liberation fighters"", at least according to the story writers. We are also treated to a very fetching Carol Kane as Earth Mother-last of the hippies remnant-who is holding out in...Oregon (must be something in the water, I think. Kesey slipped back there after his legal hassles were over). The rest of the plot you can see for yourselves. And you should, if only to see Dennis Hopper playing....Dennis Hopper in mid-life.

You may think this film is your stanard opposites clash, then become buddies film.. Well, you'd be right.. and, you would be WRONG. I admit, there are a few contrived scenes.. and the relationship is pretty much spelled out from the beginning of the film and the two main character's FIRST meeting.. BUT, the way it's played is definitely not the same old formula.Dennis Hopper easily slips into the aging hippie radical.. It's no surprise that he's comic gold. The more surprising part, and it is no knock against him, is Keifer Sutherland. He plays the straight man to the crazy radical, yet also brings an unexpected depth to the character of the FBI agent who's responsibility it is to take Huey (Hopper) back to jail.Not saying Hopper's character lacks depth.. He is very much a cardboard cut out loudmouth that also has a depth to him when he refers to his regret of having been a fugitive for 25 years after pulling off an amateurish stunt against the establishment.BUT.. the real surprise to me is still of course Sutherland.. in retrospect.. looking over his career, even up to this point, his most effective roles (and even now, on the big screen anyway) had been of villains and people who are evil.. pure and simple, and without reason for the most part. His character of the sadistic Ace Merill (Stand by Me) was a great role.. but rather just an evil role.. but, of course, Sutherland never let his evil turn into the level of mustache twirling.. He was the bully.. Or his later turns in the small parts in ""A Time to Kill"" and almost invisible (a completely omniscient and almost spectrual figure, well voice, in ""Phone Booth"". Here he plays the straight man.. An uptight FBI agent who triest to resist the humor and charm of the aging hipster..And he seems to have a rather good time playing the almost lack of humor FBI agent.. then he gets his chance as the antagonistic prankster.. But, the most shocking.. Were two particular scenes between Buckner and Carol Kane regarding his childhood.. When he talks about going to school for the first time.. The second was just one simple moment where his character was totally changed.. I am assuming everyone has seen the film and know to what I refer here. As Buckner (Sutherland) watches a family video, watch Sutherland's reaction.. As his character totally breaks down..Anyway.. I can only recommend this film to anyone.. who doesn't mind the language.. It is definitely a film for ADULTS.. but there are messages for the younger generations as well. So.. it's a buddy film.. there are opposing idealogies.. there's some character depth.. and a satisfying conclusion.. You will laugh, maybe cry.. and hopefully think about the generation that was and what it means to us now and how it may be important now than ever.",5,Flashback.. fun.. and there's a heart.,1093392000,"08 25, 2004",2004,2848,"['looking', 'box', 'art..', 'maybe', 'just', 'reading', 'box..', 'may', 'think', 'film', 'stanard', 'opposites', 'clash', 'then', 'become', 'buddies', 'film..', 'Well', ""'d"", 'be', 'right..', 'would', 'be', 'WRONG', 'admit', 'are', 'few', 'contrived', 'scenes..', 'relationship', 'pretty', 'much', 'spelled', 'out', 'beginning', 'film', 'two', 'main', 'character', 'FIRST', 'meeting..', 'BUT', 'way', 'played', 'definitely', 'not', 'same', 'old', 'formula.Dennis', 'Hopper', 'easily', 'aging', 'hippie', 'radical..', 'surprise', 'comic', 'gold', 'more', 'surprising', 'part', 'knock', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'straight', 'man', 'crazy', 'radical', 'yet', 'also', 'unexpected', 'depth', 'character', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'responsibility', 'take', 'Huey', 'Hopper', 'back', 'jail.Not', 'saying', 'Hopper', 'character', 'depth..', 'very', 'much', 'cardboard', 'cut', 'out', 'loudmouth', 'also', 'depth', 'when', 'regret', 'having', 'been', 'fugitive', '25', 'years', 'pulling', 'off', 'amateurish', 'stunt', 'establishment.BUT..', 'real', 'surprise', 'still', 'course', 'Sutherland..', 'retrospect..', 'looking', 'career', 'even', 'point', 'most', 'effective', 'roles', 'even', 'now', 'big', 'screen', 'anyway', 'had', 'been', 'villains', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'evil..', 'pure', 'simple', 'reason', 'most', 'part', 'character', 'sadistic', 'Ace', 'Merill', 'Stand', 'Me', 'was', 'great', 'role..', 'rather', 'just', 'evil', 'role..', 'course', 'Sutherland', 'never', 'let', 'evil', 'turn', 'level', 'mustache', 'twirling..', 'was', 'bully..', 'Or', 'later', 'small', 'parts', 'Time', 'Kill', 'almost', 'invisible', 'completely', 'omniscient', 'almost', 'spectrual', 'figure', 'well', 'voice', 'Phone', 'Booth', 'Here', 'straight', 'man..', 'uptight', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'triest', 'resist', 'humor', 'charm', 'aging', 'hipster..And', 'have', 'rather', 'good', 'time', 'playing', 'almost', 'lack', 'humor', 'FBI', 'agent..', 'then', 'chance', 'antagonistic', 'prankster..', 'most', 'shocking..', 'Were', 'two', 'particular', 'scenes', 'Buckner', 'Carol', 'Kane', 'regarding', 'childhood..', 'When', 'going', 'school', 'first', 'second', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'simple', 'moment', 'where', 'character', 'was', 'totally', 'changed..', 'am', 'assuming', 'everyone', 'seen', 'film', 'know', 'what', 'refer', 'here', 'Buckner', 'Sutherland', 'family', 'video', 'watch', 'Sutherland', 'reaction..', 'character', 'totally', 'breaks', 'down..Anyway..', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone..', 'who', ""n't"", 'mind', 'language..', 'definitely', 'film', 'ADULTS..', 'are', 'messages', 'younger', 'generations', 'well', 'So..', 'buddy', 'film..', 'are', 'opposing', 'character', 'depth..', 'satisfying', 'conclusion..', 'will', 'laugh', 'maybe', 'cry..', 'hopefully', 'think', 'generation', 'was', 'what', 'now', 'how', 'may', 'be', 'important', 'now', 'ever']",N/A
