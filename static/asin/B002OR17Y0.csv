1281903,A55CHTKKLTZP4,B002OR17Y0,Barry Brandon,"[2, 2]","Surprisingly good movie. No one respects or appreciates Tracy Orbison an over weight grocery clerk who lives with his mean mother and his sad sack sister. Life is not that bad from Tracy's point of view but from mine, I just want to jump in there and help the poor young man out. Things go bad for our man and he soon has to take off his rose colored glass's and see the world as it some times is, cold and heartless. Nothing can stop Tracy and he makes the best of what he has to work with, I ended up thinking this was a good guy who would make a great friend.

From having no friends and nothing more than his job to keep him going, he's just floating along in the world. Everything we see just builds the image of a very unsatisfying his life is, how little drive, ambition, and direction he has..Between having this crap grocery store job (been there) for 11 years, his only friend is his sister who doesn't get him, to an emotionally detached (borderline emotionally abusive) mother that just wants to see her kids with someone; Tracy doesn't have a lot to look forward too.Then one day his manager calls him into the office, to talk about his work ethic and future. Things more or less go decently, and giving him tickets for a local play, that him and his wife planned to see what now have other arrangements. Tracy goes with a fellow co-worker and falls in love with the stage. He enrolls in acting classes, only to find that his acting coach was the star of the play he saw, and he begins to idolize him. From that moment his life starts to look a littler brighter.  Tracy starts to put all of his love of life and effort into his acting and begins to see the world in a new light.After that, the movie fell apart. It literally became difficult for me to watch.Tracy is a nice guy, who expects more from people as he gives more than most do; he doesn't see bad in people and believes that they can change if you show an interest in their life. Sadly, not everyone in the world is like that.Throughout the movie he is taken advantage of over and over. Towards the end, the movie tries to level it's self out having some characters turn around and change their ways, but I wasn't feeling it. Too many characters did a 180 with very little drive or explanation behind it. Along with that mentality that ""Since I'm sorry it makes everything better"" instead of trying to actually make atonement for what you've done.That is a big no-no in my book.I have to say, I felt pretty bad for Tracy through everything. Another story about a nice decent guy that gets dumped on in the world. In the end, he did learn more than a few things about himself. Which I suppose is always part of the human journey. To find out who you really are and who is really there for you.I do believe that it's one of those stories ""Good idea, poorly executed"".All in all it was simply an okay movie. Not great, not horrible. Trust me I've seen a lot of horrible [indie] movies. Worth watching if only for the actors, lots of actors with great potential.Recommend: If you want something a little different and enjoy watching personal growth.",2,Eli Writes Review,1331078400,"03 7, 2012",2012,2678,"['movie', 'share', 'ups', 'downs.From', 'moment', 'enter', 'Tracy', 'life', 'see', 'how', 'empty', 'lonely', 'world', 'having', 'friends', 'nothing', 'more', 'job', 'keep', 'going', 'just', 'floating', 'along', 'world', 'Everything', 'see', 'just', 'builds', 'image', 'very', 'unsatisfying', 'life', 'how', 'little', 'drive', 'ambition', 'direction', 'having', 'crap', 'grocery', 'store', 'job', 'been', 'there', '11', 'years', 'only', 'friend', 'sister', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'borderline', 'emotionally', 'abusive', 'mother', 'just', 'see', 'kids', 'someone', 'Tracy', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'look', 'forward', 'too.Then', 'one', 'day', 'manager', 'office', 'talk', 'work', 'ethic', 'future', 'Things', 'more', 'less', 'go', 'decently', 'giving', 'tickets', 'local', 'play', 'wife', 'planned', 'see', 'what', 'now', 'have', 'other', 'arrangements', 'Tracy', 'fellow', 'co-worker', 'love', 'stage', 'acting', 'classes', 'only', 'find', 'acting', 'coach', 'was', 'star', 'play', 'saw', 'idolize', 'moment', 'life', 'look', 'littler', 'brighter', 'Tracy', 'put', 'love', 'life', 'effort', 'acting', 'see', 'world', 'new', 'light.After', 'movie', 'fell', 'apart', 'literally', 'became', 'difficult', 'watch.Tracy', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'more', 'people', 'more', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'bad', 'people', 'can', 'change', 'show', 'interest', 'life', 'Sadly', 'not', 'everyone', 'world', 'movie', 'taken', 'advantage', 'over', 'Towards', 'end', 'movie', 'level', 'out', 'having', 'characters', 'turn', 'around', 'change', 'ways', 'was', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'Too', 'many', 'characters', 'did', '180', 'very', 'little', 'drive', 'explanation', 'mentality', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'everything', 'better', 'instead', 'trying', 'actually', 'make', 'atonement', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done.That', 'big', 'no-no', 'book.I', 'have', 'say', 'felt', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Tracy', 'everything', 'story', 'nice', 'decent', 'guy', 'dumped', 'world', 'end', 'did', 'learn', 'more', 'few', 'things', 'Which', 'suppose', 'always', 'part', 'human', 'journey', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'really', 'are', 'who', 'really', 'you.I', 'do', 'believe', 'one', 'stories', 'Good', 'idea', 'poorly', 'executed', '.All', 'was', 'simply', 'okay', 'movie', 'Not', 'great', 'not', 'horrible', 'Trust', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'horrible', '[', 'indie', ']', 'movies', 'watching', 'only', 'actors', 'lots', 'actors', 'great', 'potential.Recommend', 'want', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'personal', 'growth']",N/A
1281905,A2CTJY3BTQXF06,B002OR17Y0,JL,"[1, 1]","I should preface this by saying that I tend to be a fan of weird, off-beat movies. In my opinion, ""Humble Pie"" definitely falls into that category. It is a little weird and quirky, but entertaining.Hubble Palmer plays Tracy Orbison, an overweight, sad sack who has been working as a stock boy in the same grocery store for around 7 years. He lives with his mousy sister and hyper-critical mother (played by Kathleen Quinlan) and spends his days working at the store, writing poetry in a notebook, and trying to pass his driver's test for the umpteenth time. In an attempt to change his life, Tracy enrolls in a community acting class taught by a pompous, unknown actor (played by William Baldwin).The film has a few laughs, although I found it more on the sad or somber side. It's one of those movies I like to watch when I'm feeling a little down on myself. I suppose one could say it's a success/underdog story in the sense that Tracy--despite receiving a TON of negative feedback from the other characters--doesn't lose hope, but keeps trying and believing in himself.

1281908,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002OR17Y0,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","Chris Bowman's ""Humble Pie"" has many of the hallmarks of the standard indie comedy: a misfit protagonist, quirky subsidiary characters, a small town setting, and a flat, ironic tone.Hubbel Palmer, who wrote the screenplay, stars as Tracy Orbison, an overweight nerd who compensates for his loneliness and sadness by stuffing his face pretty much nonstop throughout the course of the day.  His life, however, begins to look up when he enrolls in an acting class taught by an unctuous, second-rate actor, played winningly by Stephen Baldwin (whose acting is very much in the style of his brother, Alex's).  He also befriends a group of local youths who pretend to welcome him into their gang.  However, dark clouds are never far from Tracy's horizon, and soon he's been betrayed by the teacher and lured into a life of crime by his new-found compatriots.""Humble Pie"" wanders into some surprisingly unsettling and discomfiting areas for a comedy, even a dark one.  It's not everyday, for instance, that your main character is accused - even if unjustly - of child molestation.  Still, I like the chances the movie takes with its characters and its world, and Hubbell engages our sympathy and empathy throughout.  The movie also features ""24'""s Mary Lynn Rajskub as Tracy's levelheaded but almost equally socially awkward sister.It's more tone-piece than out-and-out uproarious comedy, but ""Humble Pie"" leaves us satiated in the end.",4,understated dark comedy,1305763200,"05 19, 2011",2011,1429,"['Chris', 'Bowman', 'Humble', 'Pie', 'many', 'hallmarks', 'standard', 'indie', 'comedy', 'misfit', 'protagonist', 'quirky', 'subsidiary', 'characters', 'small', 'town', 'setting', 'flat', 'ironic', 'tone.Hubbel', 'Palmer', 'who', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'Tracy', 'Orbison', 'overweight', 'nerd', 'who', 'loneliness', 'sadness', 'stuffing', 'face', 'pretty', 'much', 'nonstop', 'course', 'day', 'life', 'however', 'look', 'up', 'when', 'acting', 'class', 'taught', 'unctuous', 'second-rate', 'actor', 'played', 'winningly', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'acting', 'very', 'much', 'style', 'brother', 'Alex', 'also', 'group', 'local', 'youths', 'who', 'pretend', 'welcome', 'gang', 'However', 'dark', 'clouds', 'are', 'never', 'far', 'Tracy', 'horizon', 'soon', 'been', 'betrayed', 'teacher', 'lured', 'life', 'crime', 'new-found', 'compatriots', 'Humble', 'Pie', 'wanders', 'surprisingly', 'unsettling', 'discomfiting', 'areas', 'comedy', 'even', 'dark', 'one', 'not', 'everyday', 'instance', 'main', 'character', 'accused', 'even', 'unjustly', 'child', 'molestation', 'Still', 'like', 'chances', 'movie', 'characters', 'world', 'Hubbell', 'sympathy', 'empathy', 'movie', 'also', '24', 's', 'Mary', 'Lynn', 'Rajskub', 'Tracy', 'levelheaded', 'almost', 'equally', 'socially', 'awkward', 'sister.It', 'more', 'tone-piece', 'out-and-out', 'uproarious', 'comedy', 'Humble', 'Pie', 'satiated', 'end']",N/A
1281909,A3FDEI5P21XX6S,B002OR17Y0,"Steve Kuehl ""SLV Video""","[4, 4]","A wonderful little film that I hope more people hear about. One of those intellectual comedies taking place in small-city America (Utah in this case) with memorable characters and realistic writing. As an FYI I believe when this hit the indie circuit it was called American Fork.The story follows an extremely overweight adult grocery store clerk who aspires to be an actor and a writer. Unfortunately he is surrounded by the banality of life and untrustworthy souls, with a couple exceptions. One of those exceptions would not be his mother (played in deadpan perfection by Kathy Quinlan; I remember her most from that 4-film rush in 1997 with Zeus & Roxanne, Breakdown, Event Horizon and Lawn Dogs) who acknowledges her son as a loss to humanity, while his isolated sister (24's Mary Lynn Rajskub) attaches herself to the first man who pays attention to her. That man happens to be our main guy's slimy acting teacher played by William Baldwin. Normally I do not rehash plots too much but this film deserves any attention one can muster so hopefully even a small scrip like this will get someone interested. Bruce McGill does a genuine walk-on roll as the clerk's boss, and even in this short role he does much better than he did as a lead in last week's release ofValley of the Heart's Delight. The supplements are great and include:* 3 featurettes totaling 24:23 minutes. The making-of lasts 9:17 and should be watched by any aspiring crew member as it contains some of the most candid and informative interviews about what it takes to make an independent film. The curtain call supplement has some good info from Hubbell as does the script to screen set. All of the cast interviews are candid and non-fluffy.* 6 deleted scenes totaling 9:13 minutes. A couple of them helped fill some gaps from the film, but I was saddest to see theNational Lampoon's Animal House (30th Anniversary Edition)homage with McGill in one office scene get cut - he sounded like D-Day even if just for a second.I highly recommend this for those that like the down to earth feel of a low budget independent that has a high budget look filled with solid performances and real outcomes. I almost categorized this in drama, but the very last line of the film blindsides you - I hope it makes you laugh as hard as I did.
