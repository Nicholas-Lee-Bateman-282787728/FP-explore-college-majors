1104670,A1PNZV9C1YZVCP,B000VWX6SA,D. Hunter,"[8, 19]","Joyce, you present an interesting argument, and although ATHF has changed a bit in this latest season, Carl has been repeatedly killed through-out the series (he's been skinned, had his upper body blown off by Ted Nugent, had his arms ripped off an eaten by Willie Nelson (the monster), defenestrated himself and other deaths). Hand Bannana was a bit over the top, but all in all, it wasn't completely unexpected from ATHF. It took a little adjusting, but I kind of like the new ones. I will admit, I haven't seen the one with Frylock having cancer yet(Not really looking forward to that particular episode), but I think even more depressing was the one where Frylock moves out and leaves Meatwad and Shake alone and starving in a house full of rotting chickens.I will admit, I've known a lot of people who consume without thought, but when a series takes a new direction, it can be a good thing. Besides, South Park had a few seasons where I just kind of lost interest, and then they seemed to get it back. Things like ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" was a bit too far out (blood orgies and the like), but it was still amusing in places. Eventually they seemed to fall back into cool episodes, and I thought their latest DVD release was pretty sweet (As a former PC technician, I got a kick out of the W.O.W. players as they looked rather familiar).BTW: I loved the Azamanga Diaoh series (I bought the box and have seen them all), but it's a slower kind of humor. In relation to Aqua Teen it's night and day. As far as the decline of values on American TV, when we the shocking becomes boring, we move back towards actual plotlines. I've seen a ton of movies from the 50s because they're a break from the frantic race of special effects and shock values. Give it a few years and come back to this series and you'll probably wonder what the big deal was because something new and more intense will to have made this look tame in comparison...",4,Response to Joyce's review,1199404800,"01 4, 2008",2008,1939,"['Joyce', 'present', 'interesting', 'argument', 'ATHF', 'changed', 'bit', 'latest', 'season', 'Carl', 'been', 'repeatedly', 'killed', 'through-out', 'series', 'been', 'skinned', 'had', 'upper', 'body', 'blown', 'off', 'Ted', 'Nugent', 'had', 'arms', 'ripped', 'off', 'eaten', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'monster', 'defenestrated', 'other', 'deaths', 'Hand', 'Bannana', 'was', 'bit', 'top', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'unexpected', 'ATHF', 'took', 'little', 'adjusting', 'kind', 'new', 'ones', 'will', 'admit', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'one', 'Frylock', 'having', 'cancer', 'yet', 'Not', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'particular', 'episode', 'think', 'even', 'more', 'depressing', 'was', 'one', 'where', 'Frylock', 'out', 'Meatwad', 'Shake', 'alone', 'starving', 'house', 'full', 'rotting', 'chickens.I', 'will', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'known', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'consume', 'thought', 'when', 'series', 'new', 'direction', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'Besides', 'South', 'Park', 'had', 'few', 'seasons', 'where', 'just', 'kind', 'lost', 'interest', 'then', 'seemed', 'get', 'back', 'Things', 'Woodland', 'Critter', 'Christmas', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'out', 'blood', 'orgies', 'like', 'was', 'still', 'amusing', 'places', 'Eventually', 'seemed', 'fall', 'back', 'cool', 'episodes', 'thought', 'latest', 'DVD', 'release', 'was', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'former', 'PC', 'technician', 'got', 'kick', 'W.O.W', 'players', 'looked', 'rather', 'familiar', '.BTW', 'loved', 'Azamanga', 'Diaoh', 'series', 'bought', 'box', 'have', 'seen', 'slower', 'kind', 'humor', 'relation', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'night', 'day', 'As', 'far', 'decline', 'values', 'American', 'TV', 'when', 'shocking', 'becomes', 'boring', 'move', 'back', 'actual', 'plotlines', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ton', 'movies', '50s', ""'re"", 'break', 'frantic', 'race', 'special', 'effects', 'shock', 'values', 'Give', 'few', 'years', 'come', 'back', 'series', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'wonder', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'was', 'something', 'new', 'more', 'intense', 'will', 'have', 'made', 'look', 'tame', 'comparison']","Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Vol. 5"

As far as the Joyce argument goes she has her right to her opinion but i must disagree with her comments on the Cancer episode- Cancer isnt pretty and i think the ""withering away"" of Frylock makes it atleast honest. My family has lost many members to cancer- i was not offended at all and did laugh. I think its great to be able to laugh at what life may throw at us and thats what makes us human. The ability to rise above, joke,  and disregard our troubles as we carry on.

1104674,A3E68QNSCABRVW,B000VWX6SA,"Gradient Vector Field ""subjectedtometal (dot)...","[6, 9]","Okay, there are so many comments about how disturbing this is.  And yes, maybe I am desensitized by things like this, but I personally don't care and I don't think I'm all that desensitized.  I didn't find this all that disturbing, anyone who can read de Sade and not be disturbed will find nothing disturbing in this.Regardless I don't think this was top notch compared to the other volumes.  It's been a while since Volume 4 came out and I was pretty excited to get Volume 5 because I hadn't seen any of it on TV.  After watching this with my friends I seriously think they may have over extended themselves by writing a movie.  The writing on most of these episodes is just bad and it seems they have replaced humor with extremity.  Which can be done in a hilarious fashion, but it lacked writing.  Like Dickesode... that started off strong and ended stupidly.Volume 5 is really hit or miss with me, because it does have a few great episodes, but it also has some episodes that just aren't funny.  It also has others that just have a single funny moment, like when Carl got a lobotomy in Carlwash and he was licking his car afterwards... hilarious, but the rest was pretty bland.  I really liked Global Grilling though, I thought that episode was pretty smart and absolutely hilarious.  I also liked most of Hand Banana, and the rape part didn't disturb me (again, I've read de Sade)... it's a yellow hand dog... it's not even a real creature.  However, the end of the episode where Carl made his own dog, for some reason it kind of ended for me, it wasn't funny at that part, it just seemed like a forced conclusion.I'm hoping that the lack of creativity is because they were spending their time writing a good movie and that Volume 6 will get back on track.  It just seems like their creativity was exhausted, and this season was more bland than others.  I will probably pick up a Volume 6, but extremity for extremity's sake is kind of boring after a while, so I hope they focus on the writing in the future.",3,Sub-Par compared to old,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,2014,"['Okay', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'comments', 'how', 'disturbing', 'yes', 'maybe', 'am', 'desensitized', 'things', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'desensitized', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'disturbing', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'read', 'de', 'Sade', 'not', 'be', 'disturbed', 'will', 'find', 'nothing', 'disturbing', 'this.Regardless', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'compared', 'other', 'volumes', 'been', 'while', 'Volume', '4', 'came', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'get', 'Volume', '5', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'TV', 'watching', 'friends', 'seriously', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'over', 'extended', 'writing', 'movie', 'writing', 'most', 'episodes', 'just', 'bad', 'have', 'replaced', 'humor', 'extremity', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'hilarious', 'fashion', 'lacked', 'writing', 'Dickesode', 'started', 'off', 'strong', 'ended', 'stupidly.Volume', '5', 'really', 'hit', 'miss', 'have', 'few', 'great', 'episodes', 'also', 'episodes', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'also', 'others', 'just', 'have', 'single', 'funny', 'moment', 'when', 'Carl', 'got', 'lobotomy', 'Carlwash', 'was', 'licking', 'car', 'afterwards', 'hilarious', 'rest', 'was', 'pretty', 'bland', 'really', 'liked', 'Global', 'Grilling', 'thought', 'episode', 'was', 'pretty', 'smart', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'also', 'liked', 'most', 'Hand', 'Banana', 'rape', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'disturb', 'again', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Sade', 'yellow', 'hand', 'dog', 'not', 'even', 'real', 'creature', 'However', 'end', 'episode', 'where', 'Carl', 'made', 'own', 'dog', 'reason', 'kind', 'ended', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'part', 'just', 'seemed', 'forced', 'conclusion.I', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'lack', 'creativity', 'were', 'spending', 'time', 'writing', 'good', 'movie', 'Volume', '6', 'will', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'just', 'creativity', 'was', 'exhausted', 'season', 'was', 'more', 'bland', 'others', 'will', 'probably', 'pick', 'up', 'Volume', '6', 'extremity', 'extremity', 'sake', 'kind', 'boring', 'while', 'hope', 'focus', 'writing', 'future']","Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Vol. 5"
1104675,A1QW5SSQTO8DU1,B000VWX6SA,Jesse,"[3, 4]","I am seeing a lot of comments regarding the cancer episode, ""Party all the Time."" People say it is sick, isn't funny, and is insensitive. First off let me say I have just recently lost a friend of the family to cancer, so I am aware of how serious it is. But since the beginning of time, we have coped with the realities of the world with humor. Ever heard the term ""Oh The Humanity!"" which gets thrown around all the time? Well, people used to get burned alive, and that's what they screamed, and later it became something people would sarcastically say anytime something seemed crappy. Guess what? It doesn't make the suffering of real people any harsher. Joking about cancer doesn't make more people suffer from it, and in this case, it doesn't increase their suffering. Humor is our way of dealing with things, as humans. And frankly, the cancer episode is more or less a vehicle for great irony. Think about it. Frylock invents a time machine. Then he gets cancer. And what does Master Shake do? He says ""Let's use the time machine to remove Frylock's cancer."" ANybody with a brain would expect them to go back in time, but no, lol, it gets burned to try to ""smoke the cancer out."" Perfect irony.In regards to the quality of the show this volume-- it is not as content rich as Season 4 was. But come on people, COME OOOOOOOOOOON. You can't blame the writers, who spent most the season creating a full length movie for the fans, for the fact that they had less ideas in Season 5. I am glad they dedicated their efforts to a movie-- which I also own-- and that I have that AND volume 5 to enjoy, not just one, or the other.All in all, volumes 3 and 4 are the best.

1104676,A2GVFB8PHXGP2H,B000VWX6SA,Joseph Barbarie,"[0, 1]","In another of my reviews of this series, I pointed out how old-fashioned the humor of Aqua Teen Hunger Force is.  That is, it is sharp and raw, like the bodily-function humor of Dante or Chaucer (if you think ATHF is not for the faint of heart, stay away from ""The Inferno"" of Dante, or The Canterbury Tales).  It also presents fair specimens of human behavior, and examines them through the prism of our main characters, the Aqua Teens (and to a lesser extent, Carl).Here, as before, the standard ATHF plot is at work; the Aqua Teens have their daily lives interrupted by a strange, or otherworldy character.  In this season, the strangers range from quasi-celebrities like pro footballer Bart Oates and porn-queen Tera Patrick, to chimeric figures like Hand Banana, mini-shake Ezekiel, or the nefarious Dr. Wongburger.Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis stick to what they do best, as well; writing great dialogue.  Every line has a purpose -- it either sets up a joke or finishes it.  In especially fertile patches, every line will serve both of these ends, to the point where the writing is so dense with brilliancies that four or five viewings are required to get every joke.  Of particular note in this regard are the episodes ""Ezekiel"" and ""Hand Banana"".  These two, in particular, strike me as the funniest in the entire ATHF catalogue (keeping in mind, of course, classics like ""Mail Order Bride"", ""Carl"" and ""Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Future"").The show weakens when it relies too heavily on the celebrity appearance; this is the case with the Tera Patrick episode.  It's harder to be funny with this lubricious caricature (voiced by the porn queen herself) spending the entire episode crawling around on all fours.  ATHF's strength comes from the ""closed circuit"" nature of its humor -- unlike ""Family Guy"" (or ""The Simpsons"" or ""South Park"") the allusions to popular culture are usually kept to a minimum, and the show is stronger as a result.",3,Still Going Strong,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,1953,"['reviews', 'series', 'pointed', 'out', 'how', 'old-fashioned', 'humor', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'Hunger', 'Force', 'sharp', 'raw', 'bodily-function', 'humor', 'Dante', 'Chaucer', 'think', 'ATHF', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'stay', 'away', 'Inferno', 'Dante', 'Canterbury', 'Tales', 'also', 'fair', 'specimens', 'human', 'behavior', 'prism', 'main', 'characters', 'Aqua', 'Teens', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Carl', '.Here', 'before', 'standard', 'ATHF', 'plot', 'work', 'Aqua', 'Teens', 'have', 'daily', 'lives', 'interrupted', 'strange', 'otherworldy', 'character', 'season', 'strangers', 'range', 'quasi-celebrities', 'pro', 'footballer', 'Bart', 'Oates', 'porn-queen', 'Tera', 'Patrick', 'chimeric', 'figures', 'Hand', 'Banana', 'mini-shake', 'Ezekiel', 'nefarious', 'Dr.', 'Wongburger.Matt', 'Maiellaro', 'Dave', 'Willis', 'stick', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'well', 'writing', 'great', 'dialogue', 'line', 'purpose', 'up', 'joke', 'finishes', 'especially', 'fertile', 'patches', 'line', 'will', 'serve', 'ends', 'point', 'where', 'writing', 'so', 'dense', 'brilliancies', 'four', 'five', 'viewings', 'are', 'required', 'get', 'joke', 'particular', 'note', 'regard', 'are', 'episodes', 'Ezekiel', 'Hand', 'Banana', 'two', 'particular', 'strike', 'funniest', 'entire', 'ATHF', 'catalogue', 'keeping', 'mind', 'course', 'classics', 'Mail', 'Order', 'Bride', 'Carl', 'Cybernetic', 'Ghost', 'Christmas', 'Future', '.The', 'show', 'when', 'too', 'heavily', 'celebrity', 'appearance', 'case', 'Tera', 'Patrick', 'episode', 'harder', 'be', 'funny', 'lubricious', 'caricature', 'voiced', 'porn', 'queen', 'spending', 'entire', 'episode', 'crawling', 'around', 'fours', 'ATHF', 'strength', 'closed', 'circuit', 'nature', 'humor', 'Family', 'Guy', 'Simpsons', 'South', 'Park', 'allusions', 'popular', 'culture', 'are', 'usually', 'kept', 'minimum', 'show', 'stronger', 'result']","Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Vol. 5"

People getting shot in the face, decapitated, shot in the knees, disembowelled, shot in the groin, run over, shot in the hands, stabbed, pushed off a building, etc. just doesn't freak us out anymore. So directors started being CUTE about it - the ultra-fast hit-by-a-truck scene in Final Destination, is one example. But a lot of people have caught on to even this, especially college-aged kids nowadays who have fond memories of sittng on Daddy's lap while he played Doom on the computer after work.So now we have shows that must push the envelope beyond anything ever done before... Some, like Metalocalypse, manage to do it in a way that really doesn't bother me - there's real humor there, plus the violence feels more comical than ghastly, the animation is superb, it reminds me of those cool Iron Maiden album covers from the 1970's, etc. I mention this only to emphasize that I'm not some anti-violence zealot out to trash television shows. So long as it's good and there's a real story, I don't mind violence. It's the 'no hope in sight' culture we have going on nowadays that gets to me - violence and shocking situations used just so nobody has to actually write a STORY. I go into this a little more near the end~Saying that, there's something...OFF...about the new Aqua Teen cartoons. When I saw the episode where Carl wins a free (and mandatory)'Get Your Penis Cut Off' after he and the Force go shopping at a convenience store, I figured it was just a bad-episode fluke since the creators were busy at the time working hard on ""Colon"". The episode really bothered me though, for some reason. I know, it's CARL we're talking about, who's basically Archie Bunker with raging hormones, without the hidden 'softer side', and without anyone who loves him... but still.Then came the episodes that made me really really sick. And I mean PHYSICALLY nauseous amd temporarily depressed. The first of which was about a big long yellow balloon-like dog that Master Shake creates out back in Carl's pool - though it may as well have risen out of the blood pools of HELL. First off, it just LOOKS evil - and it proves his alignment by threatening Carl over the phone, breaking into his house, and anally raping him in a very brutal scene (even though you only see Handbanana (the ""dog's"" name) through Carl's window from outside). Again, you might say it's CARL that it's happening to - but does that really mean that rape is OK so long as you don't like the person it's happening to?""Oh lighten up - it's just a cartoon!"" I'm sure a lot of violence-desensitive, die-hard fans are saying that right now. Except it's NOT just a cartoon. Anyone who's seen all the other episodes knows this, otherwise you wouldn't CARE what I say about it. To us fans it's become a universe unto itself in our subconsciousnesses - the characters have become real to us in the back of our minds - why d'ya think all those Trekkies (or Star Wars fanatics) keep going to conventions dressed up as Klingons (or Jedis), and it's also why housewives really believe Kirk is secretly having sex with Jeannie on their soap opera and why millions of Americans NEEDED to see Ross and Rachel get back together on the final episode of Friends. It just HAPPENS when you watch (and love) a TV program for a very long time. So yes, bad things have happened to characters in Aqua Teen Hunger Force before - but never quite like this. It really really bothered me. I'm sure that a lot of you will still disagree with me and loved the 5th season episodes, but like I said before - while I was watching them, it felt like something was kind of off or wrong somehow. Could just be bad direting too, though.The episode that pre-empted my watching the rest of the series was the one where I had to watch Frylock slowly die of cancer. You can tell they really tried to make it disturbing too, the way the fries begin to wither and rot, and THIS I can say with probably no argument: cancer isn't funny. It never was and never will be. South Park went ahead after this aired and put out ""Stanley's Cup"" which is one of the lowest-rated episodes in the show's history.I just don't know what the hell they're trying to do or say with ATHF anymore and it feels like every show on Adult Swim is violent and/or sickening in their quest for viewers - farewell, Space Ghost! - but to be fair, like I said in paragraph seven, I stopped watching the episodes after the Frylock death ep so I only saw about half the episodes total. The other episodes were just...there. I don't really remember them so they couldn't have been that bad. They were just overshadowed by the darkness looming from the ones I mentioned. But this set still deserves one star because of the way it basically killed ATHF for me. It'll be a long time before I can watch the other four sets, and I'll never watch another new episode again - ever. I just can't stand what's become of the show.One last note - I really hope we somehow get back to entertainment without needing to resort to violence to get people to watch - violence is fine if it's PART of the story, just so long as it isn't over-used because there simply IS no story. Carl getting his penis cut off is a good example because that IS the whole story. No creativity is used in that episode whatsoever. Same goes for Frylock having cancer - just wither him away while other characters react - that's it. No story is present in that episode, just the destruction of a character I happen to like. Now, Handbanana may be creative at least, but the violence bothered me so much that I'm pretty sure that this set easily made it into Satan's DVD library.I used to believe that 'kids these days' were becoming unemotional, uncaring mega-consumers who live minute by minute - demanding to be entertained with quick and shocking bits of video and with as little thinking involved as possible. There's a lot of evidence to support this - and I had neighbors who WERE like this - but I also found out fairly recently that there's also a lot of 'kids these days' who are tired. Tired of being treated like nothing but a consumer of gadgets, tired of being told what music is 'cutting edge' and 'rebellious' by white men in suits sitting around an office all day, and tired of being shown sick GARBAGE like Deal Or No Deal, Boiling Point, My Sweet Sixteen, and season five of Aqua Teen Hunger Force. A lot of them get depressed because, well, I think it's pretty obvious with just what our culture has to offer nowadays, never mind everything else. If THIS is what we're being offered as escapism from day-to-day problems, we're in a lot of trouble.And so, if you want some great animation that might actually make you feel BETTER and that there actually IS some magic out there, where your dreams don't necessarily have to die like Frylock did in that episode, use your money to get the complete set of Azumanga Daioh and/or the three volumes of a show called Strawberry Marshmallow (it's a poofy name, but an emotionally uplifting show. Both are Japanese and I HIGHLY recommend seeing them that way with the subtitles, but they're also English dubbed, naturally). I have to recommend these shows as strongly as possible in case someone's reading this who feels like I do or understands what I'm trying to say. Watch these and I guarantee you'll get a little more hope back that there IS still magic out there, and that there's emotionally involving stories, characters that come to life (the animated characters feel more real than anyone on Prison Break or Lost or Grey's Anatomy - and I mean that as a fan of two of those three shows!) We used to have magical heartfelt shows in this country - heck, season one of Aqua Teen was one of them! - so hopefully someday the magic will return.",1,Pure Evil,1199145600,"01 1,

1104680,A1IMPZYRB79DMS,B000VWX6SA,Movie Fan,"[5, 7]","After being delayed by the production of the Aqua Teen movie, we finally get the fifth season of Aqua Teen on DVD. A lot has been written about this season. Some were disappointed with it, some were offended and some feel the series has jumped the proverbial shark. However, I loved this season, and feel it's very underrated.It's not the best season, I feel that the best season of the show wasAqua Teen Hunger Force, Vol. 4. Season five takes some risks and most of them pay off, at least for me.There are two controversial episodes in this set that really have divided fans and their opinions on the show. I think most fans of the show agree that the hand banana episode sank like a stone. I understand what the creators were trying to do, make a very unfunny subject like rape, funny, but it just doesn't work. On the other hand, the other controversial episode were Frylock is dying of cancer was very funny to me. I've had family members and a dear friend die of cancer, but I still thought this episode was funny. It's a surreal and an absurd episode that I think people are making too much about. If you don't think it's funny, read the banner the guys hang in the house welcoming Frylock home from the hospital. Plus, the use of Andrew WK (I Get Wet)  performing a party song is more proof that this episode isn't meant to be taken seriously.With that said, there are some undeniably great episodes in this season. ""Global Grilling"" is Aqua Teen at their best. Anyone who feels the show has lost a step since season 3 should see this episode, they'll reconsider those feelings. The ""Dickesode"" is much funnier now that it's uncensored. The scene where Meatwad re-enacts a tv commercial with puppets, since they don't have Tivo, is classic! Other great episodes include: ""Dirtfoot"", ""Boost Mobile"", ""Carl Wash"", ""Grim Reaper Gutters"" and ""Ezekiel"". The 2-part ""Star Studded Christmas Spectacular"" is also good, since it contains finished footage cut from the Aqua Teen movie, that is a million time better than anything seen in the movie! The rest of the episodes are pretty decent as well, with the only real duds being ""Hand Banana"" and ""Bart Oates"".The DVD packaging is a nice digipak, like previous editions and they've included a sheet of Aqua Teen Hunger Force stickers with this set, which I thought was pretty creative. Extras include adult film star Tera Patrick recording her vocals for the ""Grim Reaper Gutters"" episode, deleted scenes (too short), ""Learn to Shred Like the Master"", ""The Worst Game Ever"" (loved it) and more.Overall, not the greatest season of the series ever, but it's not the disaster some fans would have you believe. The show is still cutting edge, creative and most importantly... funny. With the never ending war and an economy that's going to go from bad to worse long before it gets better... a few laughs are in high demand these days.

""Dickesode"", ""Moonajuana"", and ""Carl Wash"" just come off as more annoying than anything else, and are devoid of any of the outright hilarity and insanity that made Aqua Teen Hunger Force so good in the first place.  Not to mention, what has been mentioned so much here already, but seeing Frylock wither away and die of cancer well, it really isn't funny.  While I admire Dave Willis and co. to go for broke with nothing sacred, seeing what happens to Frylock amongst all the usual Aqua Teen chaos is more disturbing than anything else.  That aside, Volume 5 of Aqua Teen Hunger Force is worth picking up for die hard fans of the series, but more casual fans of the series may find themselves put off by what's found here.",3,Mixed bag,1201824000,"02 1, 2008",2008,1428,"['fifth', 'volume', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'most', 'popular', 'original', 'show', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'Hunger', 'Force', 'pretty', 'mixed', 'bag', 'when', 'compared', 'previous', 'volumes', 'series', 'kinds', 'things', 'happen', 'Master', 'Shake', 'Frylock', 'Meatwad', 'Carl', 'collection', 'including', 'Shake', 'moving', 'legendary', 'New', 'Jersey', 'monster', 'Dirtfoot', 'Carl', 'trying', 'avoid', 'losing', 'manhood', 'Dickesode', 'many', 'other', 'horrible', 'things', 'happen', 'episodes', 'collected', 'here', 'two', 'aforementioned', 'episodes', 'Boost', 'Mobile', 'outrageous', 'Hand', 'Banana', 'Global', 'Grilling', 'are', 'great', 'episodes', 'be', 'sure', 'set', 'whole', 'also', 'moments', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'Dickesode', 'Moonajuana', 'Carl', 'Wash', 'just', 'come', 'off', 'more', 'annoying', 'anything', 'else', 'are', 'devoid', 'outright', 'hilarity', 'insanity', 'made', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'Hunger', 'Force', 'so', 'good', 'first', 'place', 'Not', 'mention', 'what', 'been', 'mentioned', 'so', 'much', 'here', 'already', 'seeing', 'Frylock', 'away', 'die', 'cancer', 'well', 'really', ""n't"", 'funny', 'admire', 'Dave', 'Willis', 'co.', 'go', 'broke', 'nothing', 'sacred', 'seeing', 'what', 'Frylock', 'amongst', 'usual', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'chaos', 'more', 'disturbing', 'anything', 'else', 'aside', 'Volume', '5', 'Aqua', 'Teen', 'Hunger', 'Force', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'series', 'more', 'casual', 'fans', 'series', 'may', 'find', 'put', 'off', 'what', 'found', 'here']","Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Vol. 5"

Guys, we're talking aqua teen here. I'm a fan of some of the ""alternatively"" suggested shows in those reviews, like Azumanga Diaoh, but this is an apples and oranges comparison.ATHF has always been at its core, like south park, pushing taste and using shock for its humor. Is Carl being raped by Handbanna or Frylocks cancer any less disturbing then Carl having his skin ripped off by trees, or Santa Clause burned and mutilated, and screaming in pain? The tone in this season didn't strike me as any different.I thought some episodes were very funny (I really enjoyed Dirtfoot, and Grim Reaper Gutters) Some were funny and yet disturbing (Handbanna...and to answer Joyce's question I don't find rape funny,  but this is fiction. And what's happening is absurd. We know next episode, the slate is wiped clean, and what I found funny about it was the absurd and impossible situation, not the rape itself. I don't think people that found this amusing are some kind of evil sadist. I don't find real Murder or Suicide or cruelty funny, and yet ATHF is full of these too, and Joyce admits to being a fan before this. Should I assume J thinks these things are ok in real life because they've enjoyed the show in the past? Of course not.) Some episodes didn't do anything for me (The deleted scenes from the movie episode I found boring.)I felt this way about the extras too. Some were very amusing (I liked the space Ghost ATHF premier, and the SGCTC with the brain shampoo best.)  The live tapings of grandma's voice session, and Tara whats-her-name, the porn actress, were amusing as well. Some were ok, the responses to the critics, the game trailer, and the deleted scenes, and some I thought were really terrible: The guitar lesson video, and the worst game in the world (although at least it was honest)Its not the best season, mostly for its uneven feeling, but I don't feel that I wasted my $20 on it.  I just think that trying to analyze it as anything but what the show has always been is reading far too into it. If you believe that rape and murder in fiction leads someone to do these things in real life, then stay away from this show. Not just season 5, but the whole thing. For the rest of us that can separate fiction from reality, it may be a worthy buy if you've enjoyed the rest of the show. I'd suggest viewing first before you buy if you can.",3,"Not the best, but not worthy of this venon either",1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,2468,"['season', 'not', 'favorite', ""'m"", 'genuinely', 'surprised', 'reactions', '1', 'star', 'reviews', 'Guys', ""'re"", 'talking', 'aqua', 'teen', 'here', ""'m"", 'fan', 'alternatively', 'suggested', 'shows', 'reviews', 'Azumanga', 'Diaoh', 'apples', 'oranges', 'comparison.ATHF', 'always', 'been', 'core', 'south', 'park', 'pushing', 'taste', 'using', 'shock', 'humor', 'Carl', 'being', 'raped', 'Handbanna', 'Frylocks', 'cancer', 'less', 'disturbing', 'then', 'Carl', 'having', 'skin', 'ripped', 'off', 'trees', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'burned', 'mutilated', 'screaming', 'pain', 'tone', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'strike', 'different.I', 'thought', 'episodes', 'were', 'very', 'funny', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Dirtfoot', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'Gutters', 'were', 'funny', 'yet', 'disturbing', 'Handbanna', 'answer', 'Joyce', 'question', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'rape', 'funny', 'fiction', 'what', 'happening', 'absurd', 'know', 'next', 'episode', 'slate', 'wiped', 'clean', 'what', 'found', 'funny', 'was', 'absurd', 'impossible', 'situation', 'not', 'rape', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'people', 'found', 'amusing', 'are', 'kind', 'evil', 'sadist', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'real', 'Murder', 'Suicide', 'cruelty', 'funny', 'yet', 'ATHF', 'full', 'too', 'Joyce', 'being', 'fan', 'Should', 'assume', 'J', 'things', 'are', 'ok', 'real', 'life', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'show', 'past', 'course', 'not', 'episodes', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'movie', 'episode', 'found', 'boring', 'felt', 'way', 'extras', 'too', 'were', 'very', 'amusing', 'liked', 'space', 'Ghost', 'ATHF', 'premier', 'SGCTC', 'brain', 'shampoo', 'best', 'live', 'tapings', 'grandma', 'voice', 'session', 'Tara', 'whats-her-name', 'porn', 'actress', 'were', 'amusing', 'as', 'well', 'were', 'ok', 'responses', 'critics', 'game', 'trailer', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'thought', 'were', 'really', 'terrible', 'guitar', 'lesson', 'video', 'worst', 'game', 'world', 'least', 'was', 'honest', 'not', 'best', 'season', 'mostly', 'uneven', 'feeling', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'wasted', '20', 'just', 'think', 'trying', 'analyze', 'anything', 'what', 'show', 'always', 'been', 'reading', 'far', 'too', 'believe', 'rape', 'murder', 'fiction', 'someone', 'do', 'things', 'real', 'life', 'then', 'stay', 'away', 'show', 'Not', 'just', 'season', '5', 'whole', 'thing', 'rest', 'can', 'separate', 'fiction', 'reality', 'may', 'be', 'worthy', 'buy', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'rest', 'show', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'viewing', 'first', 'buy', 'can']","Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Vol. 5"
