428571,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,630455947X,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","The title of this surprisingly fantastic film may make one assume that they are about to experience something dark and disturbing, in a supernatural way, but `The Whisperers' disturbs in a very different and possibly more effective way than that.  Telling the story of a lonely old woman at the end of her rope with fantasies playing over and over in her head and a band of thieves `so-to-speak', waiting to take advantage of her; `The Whisperers' details the horrific decline of the disadvantaged and speaks to a large array of issues that still plague society today.Margaret Ross is a seventy-six year old woman, abandoned by her husband and used up by her son who is basically wasting away in a worn down flat.  She borrows what little money she can to get by, clutters her home with things she doesn't need, and entertains the fantasy that she is aristocracy and is waiting for her money to come in.  When her delusions are fed by her son's thieving ways, Mrs. Ross finds herself on the road to a better life, until a brief conversation leads to extra hands in her purse and she finds herself tossed aside (quite literally) and reunited with her philandering husband, quick to use her for what little she has left.There is no happy ending here, only the bleak realities of poverty, but that doesn't mean that this film is void of merit (for it is that honest depiction that gives it the strongest merit).  Dame Edith Evans gives a phenomenal turn as the disillusioned old woman.  She talks with an air of arrogance that befits her delusions and she glosses her eyes over with the fears of a woman overwhelmed by what isn't really there (she hears whispers in the silence).  The way that she completely breaks down this woman's every layer is breathtaking.  Her Oscar nomination was well deserved, and quite frankly, I'm tempted to say she should have won!  The supporting cast is also very good, but Evans is the chief focal point for sure.Bryan Forbes deserves to be singled out with praise for the delicate and yet brutally honest way he directed this film.  He coaxed so much honesty out of every frame, keeping us completely enwrapped in this woman's miserable plight.",5,An unexpected triumph!,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,2176,"['title', 'surprisingly', 'fantastic', 'film', 'may', 'make', 'one', 'assume', 'are', 'experience', 'something', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'supernatural', 'way', 'Whisperers', 'disturbs', 'very', 'different', 'possibly', 'more', 'effective', 'way', 'Telling', 'story', 'lonely', 'old', 'woman', 'end', 'rope', 'fantasies', 'playing', 'head', 'band', 'thieves', 'so-to-speak', 'waiting', 'take', 'advantage', 'Whisperers', 'details', 'horrific', 'decline', 'disadvantaged', 'large', 'array', 'issues', 'still', 'plague', 'society', 'today.Margaret', 'Ross', 'seventy-six', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'abandoned', 'husband', 'used', 'up', 'son', 'who', 'basically', 'wasting', 'away', 'worn', 'down', 'flat', 'what', 'little', 'money', 'can', 'get', 'clutters', 'home', 'things', ""n't"", 'need', 'fantasy', 'aristocracy', 'waiting', 'money', 'come', 'When', 'delusions', 'are', 'fed', 'son', 'thieving', 'ways', 'Mrs.', 'Ross', 'road', 'better', 'life', 'brief', 'conversation', 'extra', 'hands', 'purse', 'tossed', 'aside', 'quite', 'literally', 'reunited', 'philandering', 'husband', 'quick', 'use', 'what', 'little', 'left.There', 'happy', 'ending', 'here', 'only', 'bleak', 'realities', 'poverty', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', 'void', 'merit', 'honest', 'depiction', 'strongest', 'merit', 'Dame', 'Edith', 'Evans', 'phenomenal', 'turn', 'disillusioned', 'old', 'woman', 'air', 'arrogance', 'delusions', 'eyes', 'fears', 'woman', 'overwhelmed', 'what', ""n't"", 'really', 'whispers', 'silence', 'way', 'completely', 'breaks', 'down', 'woman', 'layer', 'breathtaking', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'was', 'well', 'deserved', 'quite', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'tempted', 'say', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Evans', 'chief', 'focal', 'point', 'sure.Bryan', 'Forbes', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'praise', 'delicate', 'yet', 'brutally', 'honest', 'way', 'directed', 'film', 'coaxed', 'so', 'much', 'honesty', 'frame', 'keeping', 'completely', 'enwrapped', 'woman', 'miserable', 'plight']",The Whisperers 1966  VHS

It serves as a great depiction of what it's like to be of advanced age in a slum existence.  Edith Evans is a wonder to behold as Margaret Ross, an elderly woman who suffers from dementia and probably Alzheimers.  This is a very subtle turn by Evans and she doesn't overplay it in the least.  Small touches like looking into a frayed hand mirror to show the ravages of time on her physical and mental being or even the creases on her face to demonstrate her fragility.  Director Bryan Forbes frames her situation perfectly with stunning black-and-white photography and evocative slum production design.  The film takes a near calamatous turn when Margaret falls into a cache of money.  It's at that point where the film doesn't know where to go.  We're introduced to Margaret's ne'er-do-well husband Archie(Eric Portman) and then devolves into a ho-hum gangster story.

It is not a movie about a woman sitting in a room hearing voices all day, as the title and description will usually lead you to believe. It is a moving, lively and sad depiction of old age without money, and the fumbling ineffectiveness of the social welfare system to help; an English equivalent of Gorky's 'The Lower Depths'. It could use a touch of Chechov's compassionate humor. Evans was nominated for an Oscar and lost to Katherine Hepburn for her rather smug performance in 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'. Pity.

It also makes you feel the reality of what happens two elderly people. In this film Edith Evans does an excellent job portraying Margaret Ross. it seems to me that God in heaven looks out for this woman regardless of her circumstances he looks out for her. She's smart but yet senile at the same time and then very very careless and naive when it comes to Bella and allowing her to literally force and manipulate her into going out for a pork and sausage and then to Bella's house where she finally realizes that she has been set up to be robbed but it is too late because she finally passes out. She gets robbed once again probably several times when her husband comes back into her life. Her husband is an awesome scoundrels he is very intelligent very well mannered and well put together I like her husband and I'm happy that he got away in the end to live his life the way that he wants it is apparent that he has been unhappy with her and that was why he left which was definitely wrong on his part he should not have married her in the first place he purposely set out to marry an older woman and then when things BK more than he could bear he just walked out shame on him for that but also at the end with all the little Parks and grooves that was made during a movie which I couldn't help but laugh at there was some very funny moments but like I was saying at the end she cleaned up that house her flat she cleaned it up again she got herself together she cleaned up that house she went down to speak to Mr Conrad at national assistance and she's a different person and a better person and she did not hear the whisperers anymore she knows now that she can make it on her own as before not realizing that she was actually making it on her own do a degree I was proud of her at the end the house was clean she was dressed what I didn't get it was and I hope someone can help me with this her son went to prison for stealing that money but who was the person that the police officer was referring to when he was speaking to Mr Conrad in the hospital when he said that we know who did it they confessed and etc. who confessed cause I know that that family didn't confess Charlie may have confessed for stealing the money but who confessed to what happened to misses Ross,5,are u there? ??????,1403568000,"06 24, 2014",2014,2442,"['love', 'movie', 'bittersweet', 'something', 'appreciate', 'things', 'have', 'comparison', 'things', 'wish', 'had..', 'also', 'feel', 'reality', 'what', 'two', 'elderly', 'people', 'film', 'Edith', 'Evans', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Margaret', 'Ross', 'God', 'heaven', 'looks', 'out', 'woman', 'regardless', 'circumstances', 'out', 'smart', 'yet', 'senile', 'same', 'time', 'then', 'very', 'very', 'careless', 'naive', 'when', 'Bella', 'allowing', 'literally', 'force', 'manipulate', 'going', 'out', 'pork', 'sausage', 'then', 'Bella', 'house', 'where', 'finally', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'be', 'robbed', 'too', 'late', 'finally', 'out', 'robbed', 'once', 'again', 'probably', 'several', 'times', 'when', 'husband', 'back', 'life', 'husband', 'awesome', 'scoundrels', 'very', 'intelligent', 'very', 'well', 'mannered', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'like', 'husband', ""'m"", 'happy', 'got', 'away', 'end', 'live', 'life', 'way', 'apparent', 'been', 'unhappy', 'was', 'why', 'left', 'was', 'definitely', 'wrong', 'part', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'married', 'first', 'place', 'purposely', 'set', 'out', 'marry', 'older', 'woman', 'then', 'when', 'things', 'BK', 'more', 'could', 'bear', 'just', 'walked', 'out', 'shame', 'also', 'end', 'little', 'Parks', 'grooves', 'was', 'made', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'was', 'saying', 'end', 'cleaned', 'up', 'house', 'flat', 'cleaned', 'up', 'again', 'got', 'together', 'cleaned', 'up', 'house', 'went', 'down', 'speak', 'Mr', 'Conrad', 'national', 'assistance', 'different', 'person', 'better', 'person', 'did', 'not', 'hear', 'whisperers', 'anymore', 'now', 'can', 'make', 'own', 'not', 'realizing', 'was', 'actually', 'making', 'own', 'do', 'degree', 'was', 'proud', 'end', 'house', 'was', 'clean', 'was', 'dressed', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'was', 'hope', 'someone', 'can', 'help', 'son', 'went', 'prison', 'stealing', 'money', 'who', 'was', 'person', 'police', 'officer', 'was', 'referring', 'when', 'was', 'speaking', 'Mr', 'Conrad', 'hospital', 'when', 'said', 'know', 'who', 'did', 'confessed', 'etc', 'who', 'confessed', 'cause', 'know', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'confess', 'Charlie', 'may', 'have', 'confessed', 'stealing', 'money', 'who', 'confessed', 'what', 'happened', 'misses', 'Ross']",The Whisperers 1966  VHS

She claims to have many titles after her name and have come from a wealthy family, and just fallen on hard times (as she married beneath her). She's just waiting for her inheritence from her late father's estate. Her son is no good, and her shiftless husband abandoned her and neither bothered to get a divorce. She collects a lot of old newspapers in case she wants to read the articles again. One whole room is filled with newspapers and books. Mrs. Ross goes to see the welfare men (it's always men) pretty frequently and requests some new shoes. The welfare men keep cash in the desk drawers which they hand out in certain cases (not hers). Although it's summer, she always wears a coat (as do most of the characters), and when she goes to the library, she has a certain spot to sit and take off a shoe and rest her foot on a pipe, which I guess hot water runs through. They frown upon this at the library however.Her middle-aged son comes to visit her, but what he wants is a place to hide his stash of money. He gives his mom a little money and she is delighted. Of course she immediately finds the money (pretty dumb of him) and thinks it's her just reward or something. For some reason, she feels the need to take this money in her wallet (although realistically, I don't see how it could fit because it was quite a bundle - did she leave some of it behind and it was stolen from her apt?), down to the welfare office and tell them she no longer will be needing their assistance. While she's in line, she has to blab all about it to a sneaky-looking, chubby woman anyone can see is up to no good. The woman invites her for a drink, they ride a bus for a LONG time, finally get there, then have to go to the woman's home, also quite a ways away, where she yells at her lazy kids and knuckles under to a lazy but bossy husband. Anyone could have seen from the moment Mrs. Ross began talking with the chubby woman what was going to happen, so they might as well have skipped all this. JUST TAKE HER MONEY AND BE DONE WITH IT. But, no, we have to go through all this long, drawn-out rigamarole. So Mrs. Ross passes out from alcohol, and although she is presumably miles and miles away from her apartment, it shows the son and husband physically carrying her and dropping her near her abode, where she quite easily could have died if not found.However, she was found, and put in the hospital where she slowly recovers from pneumonia. The doctor tells the welfare man that she is quite an interesting case, that she used to be a domestic in a wealthy home (the closest she came to wealth). That's what would have made the movie - if they had told her story and how she came to think she was practically royalty. But they don't.  Most of the story is about how she got her money stolen. Opened her mouth when she shouldn't, got on the bus, traveled, etc. That wasn't interesting.The acting was great and Edith Evans is totally believable as the elderly lady quite set in her ways, deluded about some things but not about others.As for the story, it just went in a circle and you're right back where you started.",2,The Poor Woman Never Did Get Any New Shoes!,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",2012,3196,"['Maggie', 'Ross', '76', 'year', 'old', '96', 'woman', 'dole', 'London', 'have', 'many', 'titles', 'name', 'have', 'come', 'wealthy', 'family', 'just', 'fallen', 'hard', 'times', 'married', 'just', 'waiting', 'inheritence', 'late', 'father', 'estate', 'son', 'good', 'shiftless', 'husband', 'abandoned', 'neither', 'bothered', 'get', 'divorce', 'lot', 'old', 'newspapers', 'case', 'read', 'articles', 'again', 'One', 'whole', 'room', 'filled', 'newspapers', 'books', 'Mrs.', 'Ross', 'see', 'welfare', 'men', 'always', 'men', 'pretty', 'frequently', 'new', 'shoes', 'welfare', 'men', 'keep', 'cash', 'desk', 'drawers', 'hand', 'out', 'certain', 'cases', 'not', 'hers', 'summer', 'always', 'coat', 'do', 'most', 'characters', 'when', 'library', 'certain', 'spot', 'sit', 'take', 'off', 'shoe', 'rest', 'foot', 'pipe', 'guess', 'hot', 'water', 'frown', 'library', 'however.Her', 'middle-aged', 'son', 'visit', 'what', 'place', 'hide', 'stash', 'money', 'mom', 'little', 'money', 'delighted', 'course', 'immediately', 'money', 'pretty', 'dumb', 'just', 'reward', 'something', 'reason', 'need', 'take', 'money', 'wallet', 'realistically', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'fit', 'was', 'quite', 'bundle', 'did', 'leave', 'was', 'stolen', 'apt', 'down', 'welfare', 'office', 'tell', 'no', 'longer', 'will', 'be', 'needing', 'assistance', 'line', 'blab', 'sneaky-looking', 'chubby', 'woman', 'anyone', 'can', 'see', 'good', 'woman', 'drink', 'ride', 'bus', 'LONG', 'time', 'finally', 'get', 'there', 'then', 'have', 'go', 'woman', 'home', 'also', 'quite', 'ways', 'away', 'where', 'lazy', 'kids', 'knuckles', 'lazy', 'bossy', 'husband', 'Anyone', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'moment', 'Mrs.', 'Ross', 'began', 'talking', 'chubby', 'woman', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'skipped', 'JUST', 'TAKE', 'HER', 'MONEY', 'BE', 'DONE', 'WITH', 'IT', 'have', 'go', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'rigamarole', 'So', 'Mrs.', 'Ross', 'out', 'alcohol', 'presumably', 'miles', 'miles', 'away', 'apartment', 'son', 'husband', 'physically', 'carrying', 'dropping', 'abode', 'where', 'quite', 'easily', 'could', 'have', 'died', 'not', 'found.However', 'was', 'found', 'put', 'hospital', 'where', 'slowly', 'recovers', 'pneumonia', 'doctor', 'welfare', 'man', 'quite', 'interesting', 'case', 'used', 'be', 'domestic', 'wealthy', 'home', 'closest', 'came', 'wealth', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'had', 'told', 'story', 'how', 'came', 'think', 'was', 'practically', 'royalty', 'do', ""n't"", 'Most', 'story', 'how', 'got', 'money', 'stolen', 'Opened', 'mouth', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'got', 'bus', 'traveled', 'etc', 'was', ""n't"", 'interesting.The', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'Edith', 'Evans', 'totally', 'believable', 'elderly', 'lady', 'quite', 'set', 'ways', 'deluded', 'things', 'not', 'others.As', 'story', 'just', 'went', 'circle', ""'re"", 'right', 'back', 'where', 'started']",The Whisperers 1966  VHS

I also think the movie pretty accurately portrays dementia, although that word is never explicitly used.  Unfortunately, that's the highlight of ""The Whisperers.""

Nevertheless, the film is worth a look for Evan's performance; I can also imagine the movie being used in classes dealing with dementia.  ""The Whisperers"" isn't available yet on DVD; a situation I hope the movie studio will remedy soon.",3,"""Are you there?""",1230768000,"01 1, 2009",2009,1502,"['Dame', 'Edith', 'Evans', 'perhaps', 'best', 'movie', 'role', 'Maggie', 'Ross', '76-year-old', 'British', 'woman', 'who', 'small', 'flat', 'assistance', 'Maggie', 'paranoid', 'delusions', 'are', 'people', 'communicating', 'water', 'pipes', 'woman', 'living', 'upstairs', 'slave', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'people', 'are', 'watching', 'also', 'heiress', 'inheritance', 'been', 'delayed', 'When', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'son', 'stops', 'rare', 'visit', 'ill-gotten', 'money', 'flat', 'Maggie', 'inheritance', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'Whisperers', 'Dame', 'Evan', 'show', 'performance', 'perfectly', 'confusion', 'fear', 'loneliness', 'character', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'losing', 'Katharine', 'Hepburn', 'won', 'same', 'award', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'also', 'think', 'movie', 'pretty', 'accurately', 'portrays', 'dementia', 'word', 'never', 'explicitly', 'used', 'Unfortunately', 'highlight', 'Whisperers', 'depressing', 'movie', 'humor', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'largely', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'making', 'movie', 'rather', 'slow', 'going', 'unpleasant', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Nevertheless', 'film', 'look', 'Evan', 'performance', 'can', 'also', 'imagine', 'movie', 'being', 'used', 'classes', 'dealing', 'dementia', 'Whisperers', ""n't"", 'available', 'yet', 'DVD', 'situation', 'hope', 'movie', 'studio', 'will', 'remedy', 'soon']",The Whisperers 1966  VHS
