He set the bar at Paramount in the 1940s for comedy and this is a prime example.It is great stuff indeed.  With a cast that could not be bettered, this is one of the funniest films ever made.  It starts off fast paced and there is not one single moment the screen is idle.Betty Hutton gives a great performance and she was only 22 years old at the time.  This film was her breakthrough in Hollywood and she is charming and endearingly funny.Eddie Bracken is marvelous as the leading man with the funny face and the stutter.  In my opinion he should have gotten nominated for an academy award.  I think he is the glue that holds the film together!!William Demarest (later Uncle Charley on Tv's ""My Three Sons"") as Betty's father is deliciously hammy and bombastic.Diana Lynn, fourteen at the time, plays the kid sister with acerbic aplomb and sarcastic wit.  She is amazing.  Watch the scene toward the end when she and Betty are tying Bill Demarest in the jail cell and she conks him on the head.....what a howler!!This film is hilarious and for the time it was made...at the height of WWII, was a refreshing escape from the madness that was going on in the world at the time.When you have a couple of hours on a rainy Saturday morning or you feel like a good movie on a late night, a movie to make you feel good and that will make you laugh your head off, I recommend this classic!

The plot involves a beautiful young blonde who sneaks out to a party for servicemen about to be shipped off to war, whereupon she gets conked silly on the head and foolishly goes along with the crowd who decide to get married en masse, under assumed names.  She takes this marriage thing all the way, so to speak, and is impregnated....and cannot remember who she married or what name she or he used.Then there's the poor but standup moon-eyed sap who's loved her for years, who displays tremendous chivalry by trying to figure out how to marry her and give the child a father without committing bigamy.These days there'd be no marriage, the sap wouldn't have a chance, and grampa would raise the baby in spite of himself while the dingy blonde runs off to escape any responsibility.But I'm getting about 60 years ahead of myself.As it is, this little-remembered classic comedy is more than just a laugh riot, which it is.  It's more than just a bit of WWII nostalgia, which it is.  It's also a wistful reminder of innocent days gone by, days when people were like this, although certainly not as much like this as the movies would have us believe.I always think of William Demerest as the grumpy old Uncle Charlie from TV's ""My Three Sons,"" but he was grumpy long before TV was popular.  Here he portrays the town constable and single father of two teen daughters, and is at his absolute grumpiest.  Having just seen him as Henry Fonda's bodyguard in ""The Lady Eve,"" another Sturges film, it's a treat to see him in an even more physically comedic role here.  The old guy is a riot when it comes to broad comedy.  What a mug!I don't remember having heard of Eddie Bracken before, as this was all before my time.  He's something of an anemic Donald O'Connor without rhythm, portraying a mid 20th century version of Ben Stiller's character in ""There's Something About Mary,"" a much less hilarious film than this.  Bracken plays the poor sap noted above, who ultimately, through the titular ""miracle,"" becomes a national hero after first becoming the ultimate local bad guy.  He deserves neither title, but it gives little away to state that he does get the girl.  And he deserves her...and about a half-dozen other surprises.

216232,A3N95R1VKWROWF,6300215490,Christopher Schwinger,"[0, 2]","My introduction to Preston Sturges was this movie.  It dissuaded me from pursuing further comedies written and directed by him.  I could not believe how unworthwhile the humor is in this.  Betty Hutton is surprised to find out she's pregnant, after a drunken night with an enlisted man who just went off to WWII.  (That's considered a milestone in getting past censorship in 40s comedies.  If you ask me, that's a silly thing to be proud of, like Rhett Butler getting to say the d word in 1939 at the end of Gone with the Wind.)  She has a very intimidating fuddy-duddy father, William Demarest (typecast in that kind of role), and goes to great lengths to hide her pregnancy.  Eddie Bracken is her love interest and is extremely dorky, to the point of really annoying me whenever he regains his simplistic, starry-eyed perspective and wants to act like the knight in shining armor.  He is what really killed this comedy for me, but it wasn't very funny to me even without him.  It's often hard to define why something is funny or not, but in this movie, I can put into words four factors of why I didn't find it funny:  1) Eddie Bracken is such a caricatured, starry-eyed dork, 2) the comedy almost entirely revolves around deception (which I think is a rather uncreative form of comedy), 3) William Demarest is caricatured as being overly conservative and reactionary, while Betty Hutton's premarital pregnancy is treated as just a mistake instead of as a sign of weak character on her part, and 4) the ending.  (See next paragraph.)The ending is so dumb that whatever remaining hope I had for the movie being slightly funny went out the window.  The Axis powers are in panic because Betty Hutton has sextuplets.  There's a level of implausibility that makes something funny, but this is implausible that just makes it STUPID.I'm glad I saw this on YouTube instead of investing in the DVD.

Eddie Bracken plays the nerd who loves her and comes to her rescue when she can not recall whom she married.Hutton and Bracken are superb, hilarious in the slapstick but also very moving in the more tender moments. The supporting cast are also brilliant as in all of Sturges's films. William Demarest has a large part as Hutton's angry father and Diana Lynn plays her facetious sister. Both have some great lines but Lynn almost steals the show with her cynical delivery. The film is framed with scenes of Brian Donlevy as ""The Great McGinty"" and Akim Tamiroff as the mayor, a throwback to an earlier Sturges film. You may have to see the film a few times to savour all their one liners. Sturges often uses long takes and the actors' skill with the dialogue is impressive.The print of the film is excellent and the extras consist of 2 documentaries, one about Sturges and one about censorship. Clearly edited from the same interviews, they benefit from the presence of Sturges's widow and Eddie Bracken himself.

While dancing she hits her head on a disco ball and is knocked silly. The next morning she wakes up at home feeling like Hell, but that's just the beginning of it: she's pregnant and doesn't even know who the father is! Remember this is 1944! All she can remember is she thinks she married some guy named ""Ratzkiwatzki"" or something like that. Devastated by this news she doesn't know what to do so she devises a plan to quickly marry Norval Jones, who's been in love with her for years, but when she sees how deeply he's in love she can't trick him like that so...well, I've already told you too much, but take my word for is this movie is hilarious. The first time I saw it I literally laughed until I was crying and my sides hurt so bad I thought I was going to puke.From a filmmaker's standpoint TMOMC is notable for some great long shots, especially Trudy and Norval's walk when she tell him she's pregnant. It's nearly 4 minutes long and physically covers a lot of ground, but the audience probably never notices it because their too busy laughing at Norval's constant screaming. Also notice how those long scenes are only during the first half of the movie, later on as the excitement grows the shots become shorter and shorter, not to mention a lot more people show up until you have some great Sturges crowd scenes where you have five people talking at once and it's all funny.I love this movie and cannot say enough things about it. Brilliant script and direction by a true Hollywood master and the acting! How did Eddie Bracken not get at least nominated for an Oscar for his role here? He was hilarious. And lets not forget Sturges normal actors...of his 38 frequent actors 22 were here. Most notable was William Demarest as Trudy's gruff and tough father, Constable Edmund Kockenlocker.I would really like to know if it's even possible for Hollywood to make a movie like this anymore? Made back in 1944 the story talks nonstop about sex and marriage, but yet it's completely clean language-wise and without any gross-out humor. Everything was done so subtly and so full of satire that it somehow got passed the Hays Office! I love crude humor as much as the next person, but I would be thrilled beyond belief if somebody started making clean screwball comedies like this today. Some of the comedies by Howard Hawks, Preston Sturges, Jack Conway, Frank Capra and Leo McCarey were so rich that I can watch them countless times and never get bored. I've had to have seen THE AWFUL TRUTH easily over 400 times. And I've seen THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK at least 20. Highly recommended.Funny story: In a interview with Eddie Bracken he said that he came up with the idea of Norval walking through the screen door and didn't tell Sturges, he just did it. Well Preston was on the camera and started laughing so hard he actually fell out of his seat!

They play new the second, third, tenth time around; catching the light at angles you'd never seen them in before, gaining richness and profundity in familiar details while throwing never-noticed subtleties into sudden high relief. They awaken you to reserves of emotion inside yourself plumbed so rarely, you'd almost forgotten you had them in you all along. They are one-to-one experiences - even if you see a film like Preston Sturges' MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK in a packed revival house laughing uproariously en masse, you can only share a surface pleasure with the strangers around you: the deeper joys of this movie are yours and yours alone, shocking you into an awareness of how potent a great film can be with the force of a seismic shift. Even when you encounter [a silly] review that completely, callously, misses the whole point, you can't even get angry - how could you? A STAR WARS or Tarantino fan chucking terms like 'dated' or 'foolish' at a Preston Sturges movie is too pitiable a wretch to deserve actual scorn: maybe one day they'll figure it out, if they're lucky. MIRACLE turns out to be aptly titled, as this heady, unduplicable blend of slapstick, sitcom, surrealism and sharply observed slice-of-life manages to embody WW2-era popular entertainment while standing as far apart and above its contemporaries as possible. The genius of Sturges was not that he ran end-runs around the censors, but that he subverted them from the safest place to do so: deep within the fortress of the Production Code. The story of a small-town girl who finds herself both married and unmarried at the same time - but DEFINITELY pregnant in either case - is nonstop funny and brimming with heart and honest sentiment, yet it's never less than a devastating indictment of the kind of mean-spirited provincialism that brought such things as the Code into being in the first place. Rather than single out exemplary performances, I direct you instead to the complete cast-list. The mark of a Preston Sturges movie is a wealth of expert actors, each blessed with scenes and dialogue devised to play to their respective strengths: thus, the Esther Howards and Porter Halls shine as indelibly in small roles as the leads (Bracken, Hutton, Lynn & Demarest, all inspired). If you haven't yet seen this unforgettable jewel, beat a path to wherever it is you have to beat a path to and rectify the situation immediately.

All the character actors are wonderful, but I especially like Al Bridge's portrayal of a sympathetic lawyer (Al Bridge usually was consigned to playing villains in B-westerns).  This is also a great Christmas movie -- a sort of unsentimental ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (surely Capra made his masterpiece somewhat under the influence of this film).

216243,A106016KSI0YQ,6300215490,Jay Dickson,"[20, 22]","A smalltown goodtime girl named Trudy Kockenlocker (Betty Hutton) goes off with a group of soldiers before they're sent off to war; the next morning she has vague memories of marrying one of them--someone, she says, like a name like ""Ratzskywatzsky""--but with no memory of who exactly or where to find him. Soon after she finds out she's pregnant, and pressures the 4-F boy next door (Eddie Bracken) to help her out of her predicament.All Preston Sturges comedies are worth your time if only because they all manage to be so funny while also being so innovative from a narrative perspective: Sturges loved playing with stories within stories, and yet does it so simply and hilariously as only to enhance the story's pleasure. (The framing device of the governor hearing the news and sorting all the problems out at the end as deus ex machina seems like a comic trick borrowing from Moli&eacute;re.) But the story also broke tremendous ground by dint of its subject matter, which only barely got past the Hays Code censors; if you're familiar with the films of the time, the fact that Private Ratzskywatzsky never appears by the story's end to reclaim Trudy or their issue will seem astonishing. (All the same, the film was a huge hit.)The film has much going for it besides Sturges's direction and writing. Not the least of these is Betty Hutton, who got perhaps the best role she ever had as the overenthusiastic Trudy. Hutton is all but forgotten today, but she was one of the few stars of Broadway musical comedy who made a very successful transition to Hollywood. Unlike Ethel Merman or Zero Mostel, whose enormous theatrical energies seemed artificial for the screen, Hutton succeeded because her over-the-top desperation seemed at its best (as here) incredibly sincere, and so her funniest moments are when she gives way so mercurially to her change of feelings with such zest and extremity. One of my favorite moments is when her father forbids her to go out to the dance with the soldiers; within a moment she goes from utter elation to blank depression, and she walks up the stairs with such disappointment in her spine that she's deeply endearing. Eddie Bracken's nervous nerdish comedy has aged less well than Hutton's hyperenthusiasm, perhaps, and the film suffers from its somewhat patronizing vision of smalltown life. (Sturges's comedies work best when he is making fun of sophisticates rather than just rubes, as in SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS or THE PALM BEACH STORY--he's at his best when he shows the wealthy and privileged to be just as apt towards enacting or being taken in by utterly harebrained schemes as is the middle class.) But the film has two fantastic assets in William Demarest as Trudy's crotchety father and Diana Lynn doing her funny specialty at adolescent knowingness as Trudy's incredibly sane younger sister. There's a great slapstick bit Sturges works up that whenever Lynn sasses her father Demarest tries to give her a flying kick in the pants, which he invariably mistimes so that he falls flat on his back.",4,Funny and ground-breaking (in many ways),1131148800,"11 5, 2005",2005,3041,"['smalltown', 'goodtime', 'girl', 'named', 'Trudy', 'Kockenlocker', 'Betty', 'Hutton', 'group', 'soldiers', ""'re"", 'sent', 'off', 'war', 'next', 'morning', 'vague', 'memories', 'marrying', 'one', 'someone', 'name', 'Ratzskywatzsky', 'memory', 'who', 'exactly', 'where', 'find', 'Soon', 'out', 'pregnant', '4-F', 'boy', 'next', 'door', 'Eddie', 'Bracken', 'help', 'predicament.All', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'comedies', 'are', 'time', 'only', 'manage', 'be', 'so', 'funny', 'also', 'being', 'so', 'innovative', 'narrative', 'perspective', 'Sturges', 'loved', 'playing', 'stories', 'stories', 'yet', 'so', 'simply', 'hilariously', 'only', 'enhance', 'story', 'pleasure', 'framing', 'device', 'governor', 'hearing', 'news', 'sorting', 'problems', 'out', 'end', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'comic', 'trick', 'borrowing', 'Moli', 'eacute', 're', 'story', 'also', 'broke', 'tremendous', 'ground', 'dint', 'subject', 'matter', 'only', 'barely', 'got', 'Hays', 'Code', 'censors', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'films', 'time', 'fact', 'Private', 'Ratzskywatzsky', 'never', 'story', 'end', 'reclaim', 'Trudy', 'issue', 'will', 'seem', 'astonishing', 'same', 'film', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'film', 'much', 'going', 'Sturges', 'direction', 'writing', 'Not', 'least', 'Betty', 'Hutton', 'who', 'got', 'perhaps', 'best', 'role', 'ever', 'had', 'overenthusiastic', 'Trudy', 'Hutton', 'forgotten', 'today', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'stars', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'comedy', 'who', 'made', 'very', 'successful', 'transition', 'Hollywood', 'Ethel', 'Merman', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'enormous', 'theatrical', 'energies', 'seemed', 'artificial', 'screen', 'Hutton', 'succeeded', 'over-the-top', 'desperation', 'seemed', 'best', 'here', 'incredibly', 'sincere', 'so', 'funniest', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'way', 'so', 'mercurially', 'change', 'feelings', 'such', 'zest', 'extremity', 'One', 'favorite', 'moments', 'when', 'father', 'go', 'out', 'dance', 'soldiers', 'moment', 'utter', 'elation', 'blank', 'depression', 'stairs', 'such', 'disappointment', 'spine', 'deeply', 'endearing', 'Eddie', 'Bracken', 'nervous', 'nerdish', 'comedy', 'aged', 'less', 'well', 'Hutton', 'hyperenthusiasm', 'perhaps', 'film', 'suffers', 'somewhat', 'patronizing', 'vision', 'smalltown', 'life', 'Sturges', 'comedies', 'work', 'best', 'when', 'making', 'fun', 'sophisticates', 'rather', 'just', 'rubes', 'SULLIVAN', 'TRAVELS', 'THE', 'PALM', 'BEACH', 'STORY', 'best', 'when', 'wealthy', 'privileged', 'be', 'just', 'apt', 'towards', 'enacting', 'being', 'taken', 'utterly', 'harebrained', 'schemes', 'middle', 'class', 'film', 'two', 'fantastic', 'assets', 'William', 'Demarest', 'Trudy', 'crotchety', 'father', 'Diana', 'Lynn', 'doing', 'funny', 'specialty', 'adolescent', 'knowingness', 'Trudy', 'incredibly', 'sane', 'younger', 'sister', 'great', 'slapstick', 'bit', 'Sturges', 'up', 'whenever', 'Lynn', 'father', 'Demarest', 'give', 'flying', 'kick', 'pants', 'invariably', 'so', 'flat', 'back']",Miracle of Morgan's Creek VHS

216252,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,6300215490,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[6, 7]","During the censorious era of Hollywood's Production Code, a few brave filmmakers stretched the limits of censorship. MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK is one of writer/director Preston Sturges' top screwball war-time comedies, which was considered a controversial, bold, and irreverent farce at the time, due to its scandalous content. Trudy Kockenlocker (read that name carefully), a small-town girl from Morgan's Creek, attends an all-night party with servicemen from the local army base, gets drunk, and marries one of the soldiers. She finds herself pregnant, then can't remember which soldier she married. She convinces bankclerk/4-F reject Norval Jones to marry her and pretend to be the father. Before the film ends, Trudy gives birth to sextuplets and the young couple become national celebrities (I don't even wanna think how much controversy this cause upon its release).The censors were just as upset that Sturges was making fun of the war effort, as much as they were for an unmarried pregnant girl being the heroine of the film. Imagine a GI getting a girl pregnant and leaving the parenting to a draft reject! The censors insisted on numerous changes before the film's release, delaying it for a year. With all the tampering, the basic idea, that Trudy slept with a drunk soldier, forgot his name, and got pregnant, came across loud and clear.The film satirizes the wartime idolatry of soldiers and the innocent, faithful girls they left behind. Today, the idea that an unwed mother brought terrible disgrace seems rather quaint, but it certainly did skirt the production code quite a bit. Represented is a woman having sex with a soldier and not even remembering his name; you have a male lead who is positioned as an almost gay character, someone who can't even fight in the army; you have a number of people in high places who do not act in anything resembling an honorable way. The movie directly attacks the code and its bylaws by having the town willing to shun Trudy, until she puts it on the map by having sextuplets. The film is a stranger to small-town American life as idealized in the films of Frank Capra. Sturges was even described as the anti-Capra by French critic Andre Bazin. His small towns were not the pie-baking heartland. The inhabitants are diverse and irritable, not noble, kind or understanding, and show the turmoil beneath the facade of a placid rural life.The film is brilliant on all levels.

""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" is sure to delight and surprise many of those who think movies of the 1940's were morally conservative and rather tame by today's standards.To sum up, in the small town of Morgan's Creek of 1943, Trudy (played wonderfully by Betty Hutton) helps ""send the boys off to war"" so to speak and finds out afterwards that she is both married and pregnant.  With no idea who the father is, Trudy (with help from her younger sister) plots to marry Norval (the irrepressable Eddie Bracken in what may be his finest role), a 4-F soldier-wannabe whose been in love with Trudy since she was ""knee-high to a fire hydrant"" or something like that.(Norval's condition of getting so nervous that he sees ""The Spots!"", is used to great effect during the film.)What follows is probably the most over-the-top, insanely funny sequence of events that eventually reaches world-wide proportions.William Demerest is unforgettable as the put-upon father whose at odds with his two daughters. His constant bickering with Emmy (Diana Lynn), his younger daughter, is absolutely priceless and for me the highlight of the film.For Sturges fans, the appearence of Brian Donlevy and Akim Tamiroff reprising their roles from ""The Great McGinty"" will be a particular delight.  Donlevy has one of the best lines when he declares ""the miracle"" to be the biggest thing to hit his state ""since we stole it from the Indians!"".A couple of notes; First off, the idea that Trudy got drunk during the ""send off"" is sheer nonsense.  She is never seen drinking anything, save for her sip of the ""Victory Lemonade"" (which is later established to be spiked).  But the look on her face is enough to let you know that she didn't have anymore of the stuff.Secondly, Sturges received two nominations for Best Original Screenplay for ""Miracle"" & ""Hail, The Conquering Hero!"" in 1944.

Since the action takes place in a small Mid-Western town with the usual local yokels and the newly arrived GI's, boy's and girls do without the preliminaries as the privates are marched to the grim reaper.  The girls give it up with romantic heroism.  The fumbling in the dark after an evening of spiked lemonade causes pregnancy and social chaos.  Betty Hutton is the prettiest girl in town and the most innocent soon-to-be mother in history thanks to the movie code and sexual regulations left over from the 19th Century.  She got married, but to whom? No sex without marriage of course, but what a convoluted script to get this idea across as to preserve the GI pin-ups honor. The laughs burst from the cover up.  Preston Sturges, a true genius, pumped it up to the hokey, sentimental climax.  Slapstick and screwball comedy are melded to a script that can be described as a screenplay converted to a play and then regurgitated to a film.  The scenes are very long and the actors walk the town as though they were on a stage.  You have to see the lack of quick cuts to understand what I mean. It just doesn't look like a Hollywood film.Much has been said about the in-house players that worked in Sturges' films.  William Demarest is hilarious, a pratfall a minute.  Eddie Braken practically invents the lovable nerd.  Diana Lynn is the most sarcastic teen ever.  McGinty is the Governor of the Great State of Anywhere.

Trudy Kockenlocker (energetically portrayed by a very young Betty Hutton) goes out to a dance, drinks a little too much punch, and awakes the next day with a paper ring around her finger, and the vague memory that someone suggested that everyone in the party go get married, in her case ""perhaps"" to someone named something like Yatskywatsky.  A few weeks later, she finds herself pregnant, and unaware of who the father/her husband might be.  She then plots to snag Norval Jones (Eddie Bracken), the quintessential 4-F local boy, as a husband to save her from local shame.  Those are the bare bones of the story, but Sturges enriches it with enormously rich and clever dialog to create one of the great film comedies.  Some might find the onscreen personalities of Bracken and Hutton a bit too pungent, but most others will find them hysterical in a manic, slapstickish way.  William Demarest, as Officer Kockenlocker, Trudy's father, steals the film in what is almost certainly his greatest screen role.The narrative of the film is structured around a phone call to Governor McGinty.  For those who haven't seen Sturges's first directorial effort, Brian Donlevy played the title role in THE GREAT McGINTY and Akim Tamiroff played ""The Boss.""  They reprise those roles in cameos here.A very great film comedy.  Perhaps not quite as outstanding as SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS or THE LADY EVE, but nonetheless still on the short list of the great film comedies of the 1940s.",5,More classic madness from Preston Sturges,1040947200,"12 27, 2002",2002,1506,"['way', 'quite', 'perverse', 'film', 'Trudy', 'Kockenlocker', 'energetically', 'portrayed', 'very', 'young', 'Betty', 'Hutton', 'out', 'dance', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'punch', 'next', 'day', 'paper', 'ring', 'finger', 'vague', 'memory', 'someone', 'suggested', 'everyone', 'party', 'go', 'get', 'married', 'case', 'perhaps', 'someone', 'named', 'something', 'Yatskywatsky', 'A', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'pregnant', 'unaware', 'who', 'father/her', 'husband', 'might', 'be', 'then', 'plots', 'snag', 'Norval', 'Jones', 'Eddie', 'Bracken', 'quintessential', '4-F', 'local', 'boy', 'husband', 'save', 'local', 'shame', 'are', 'bare', 'bones', 'story', 'Sturges', 'enormously', 'rich', 'clever', 'dialog', 'create', 'one', 'great', 'film', 'comedies', 'might', 'find', 'onscreen', 'personalities', 'Bracken', 'Hutton', 'bit', 'too', 'pungent', 'most', 'others', 'will', 'find', 'hysterical', 'manic', 'slapstickish', 'way', 'William', 'Demarest', 'Officer', 'Kockenlocker', 'Trudy', 'father', 'film', 'what', 'almost', 'certainly', 'greatest', 'screen', 'role.The', 'narrative', 'film', 'structured', 'phone', 'call', 'Governor', 'McGinty', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Sturges', 'first', 'directorial', 'effort', 'Brian', 'Donlevy', 'played', 'title', 'role', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'McGINTY', 'Akim', 'Tamiroff', 'played', 'Boss', 'reprise', 'roles', 'cameos', 'here.A', 'very', 'great', 'film', 'comedy', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'outstanding', 'SULLIVAN', 'TRAVELS', 'THE', 'LADY', 'EVE', 'nonetheless', 'still', 'short', 'list', 'great', 'film', 'comedies', '1940s']",Miracle of Morgan's Creek VHS

Preston Struges, was one of the top writers then directors for Paramount Studios when he made this film. He was the type of man to have a crazy scene in there some kind of way. Another thing about him is that he sprinkled the word sex in his movies pretty liberally. Supposedly, it was made in 1941,1942, delayed a while, some say due to the nature of the film, and hmm, I could see why if that be the case. Some say for other reasons; Either way, with all the tampering, changes, what have you, you still come up with this. Now you have this young girl Trudy Knockenhocker played with relish by Betty Hutton, who is the daughter of the local policeman William Demarest(who gave a sterling performance); It's World War 2, the boys are leaving town, and Trudy wants to go to the party the town is holding for the boys leaving for war. ok, but the father, doesn't want her to go; So she gets Norval Jones, her 4F dependable buddy, who also loves the proverbial ground she walks on(played by Eddie Bracken)to say they were going to the movies. well, she ditches him there and goes to the ball; Now first off the bat, when Trudy leaves supposedly going to the movies in a ball gown and William Demarest doesn't get the hint, something ain't right. Let me not neglect to add Diana Lynn who plays her little but wise knowing sister; So, Norval gets stuck at the movies, Trudy has the time of her life at the ball; And boy what a time.So much so, she has a memory lapse due to her drinking too much champagne, and is late picking Norval up that has folks thinking he took advantage of her; Oh if they only knew...Anyhow, Trudy ends up noticing this ring on her finger but she vaguely remembers the details. Now folks, even in this day and time, we look at women kind of funny for that to an extent, but in those days, THAT WAS A NO NO! and to show it in the movies, BIG NO NO!! To this day, I still wonder how The Hays Office let this movie come off the lot to theaters. But moving on, the night is forgotten but then old Trudy ends up pregnant (OH HORROR!) and now she's got a dillemma; She can't remember the name of the man, only some funny name and that they all use fake names to marry. So lil sister cooks up a scheme to let Norval take the fall and marry her. Now mind you, the fella only loved her from Day One, so for him it was a big opportunity, but for her it was a way out of a funky situation. So, she comes up with the idea of him dressing up in a uniform (WW1)and go somewhere to get married with fake names, but when they kissed and stated their real names afterwards, the license folks got wise and bring in the law all the way to the state government gets involved in this one girl's business.Talk about a little problem snowballing..

As the film opens, Trudy is extremely excited about an upcoming party to send off the local men to fight in WWII.  She schemes to attend the party, despite being forbid by her overprotective father (the brilliant William Demarest).  As the night goes on, the party gets more and more wild, ending in Betty unexpectedly married and pregnant.  The only problem is that she cannot remember getting married or to whom.  To solve her dilemma, she resolves to get married to a local boy, the inept and frightened Norval Jones, played by Eddie Bracken.  The situation spins completely out of control from here.""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"" was written and directed by the peerless Preston Sturges.  The film is on par with his greatest, such as ""Hail the Conquering Hero.""  Bracken would go on to star ""Hail"" as well, but his performance here is arguably his best.  Playing the nerdy Norvel who ""sees spots"" when he gets nervous, Bracken is perfect.  Betty Hutton also would never have a better role; unfortunately, she really never attained the status she deserved.The film's humor is rather zesty, and the pregnancy plot is handled in a relative frank manner, making for a bit of a surprise for a 1940s movie.  The script manages to be touching as well as funny, eliciting some genuine laughs.  In particular, Diana Lynn steals the show as Hutton's precocious teen sister, Emmy.  The chemistry between Emmy and her father is fantastic.  The film deservedly received an Oscar nomination for Best Writing (Original Screenplay), losing to ""Wilson.""Despite its quality, ""Miracle"" is definitely not as well known as other Sturges classics.  However, it stands up against the greatest comedies of this period; accordingly it was added to the US Film Registry in 2001.  Highly recommended for fans of 1940s comedy as well as Preston Sturges devotees.  Hopefully the film will be released on DVD soon, or else it may continue to be unjustifiably overlooked.",4,Daughers.
