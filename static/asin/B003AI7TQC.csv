I didn't think this particular program was her best effort, but I enjoy her so much, I would have ordered it anyway. Among her humor, she is able to weave stories about her own life that show the viewer that everyone suffers losses and setbacks and with God's help, anyone can survive. This dear lady has suffered a lot of heartache and even a mental/medical condition, yet she can still find joy in life. A real inspiration. while her programs are generally aimed toward the ladies, everyone can see everyday life in her stories. I recommend all of her programs.",4,Wonderful program,1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,639,"['very', 'much', 'appreciate', 'Chonda', 'humor', ""n't"", 'get', 'bit', 'vulgar', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'particular', 'program', 'was', 'best', 'effort', 'enjoy', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'ordered', 'anyway', 'humor', 'able', 'weave', 'stories', 'own', 'life', 'show', 'viewer', 'everyone', 'losses', 'setbacks', 'God', 'help', 'anyone', 'can', 'survive', 'dear', 'lady', 'suffered', 'lot', 'heartache', 'even', 'mental/medical', 'condition', 'yet', 'can', 'still', 'find', 'joy', 'life', 'real', 'inspiration', 'programs', 'are', 'generally', 'aimed', 'ladies', 'everyone', 'can', 'see', 'everyday', 'life', 'stories', 'recommend', 'programs']",N/A

Her DVD's always leave me feeling uplifted. I was so excited to receive this DVD to add to my collection. I was not disappointed. Even my husband enjoys watching her videos with me. It arrived quickly & in perfect condition. :),5,Great watch.,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,359,"['love', 'Chonda', 'Pierce', 'so', 'inspirational', 'way', 'can', 'make', 'so', 'hard', 'then', 'can', 'turn', 'message', 'DVD', 'always', 'leave', 'feeling', 'uplifted', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'receive', 'DVD', 'add', 'collection', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'Even', 'husband', 'watching', 'videos', 'arrived', 'quickly', 'perfect', 'condition']",N/A

It  is a blessing to see her with so much sadness in her history to be able to keep a sense of humor and praise the Lord every chance she gets.,5,Funny Girl,1320192000,"11 2, 2011",2011,160,"['Chonda', 'funny', 'blessing', 'see', 'so', 'much', 'sadness', 'history', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'sense', 'humor', 'praise', 'Lord', 'chance']",N/A
1334779,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B003AI7TQC,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[6, 6]","A MAN REVIEWING CHONDA PIERCE FIRST. Saints preserve us! Chonda will be man-bashing me in her next stand-up routine, for being the 1st Amazon reviewer of ""Did I Say That Out Loud?"" This DVD was my wife's gift from her girl-friend, and I watched too. Have to admit she had me laughing-out-loud at times, snickering more, also smiling, and catching a few of her man-shots aimed at the gents because most of her live audience was the girls-of all ages.Chonda is a Christian Phyllis Diller. She makes fun of herself, a fast-paced self-bashing comedienne who often laughs along with her audience, like the late Red Skelton. Leave it to a man to compare Chonda to a male. Sorry girls. She loves to use the line ""In't tha-at pree-cious?"" No topic is sacred while performing at World Outreach Church, Murfreesburo, TN, her claimed hometown.Her stand-up routine is followed with a question & answer session proving her impromptu comedy is at peak performance. Then, by audience request, Chonda sings ""Story of my Life"" (words/music by Shannon Werelberg). Chonda Pierce has a nice voice that is as surprising as the male comedian Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors). Her southern drawl (without the belle status) is similar to Nabors, but is negligible once the music begins, like Jim. ""Blessed Assurance"" is performed vocally during the DVD credits, with a comical added insertion (and I'll not ruin the surprise) within.DVD has no subtitles or CC. Audio Format offers 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo or 5.1 Dolby Surround.My vote was 4 stars, but thinking it might be higher for women, I asked my wife. She said 4 as well. She liked Chonda in ""This Ain't Prettyville"" better.Good Christian comedy, fit for the family, but the gals will gain the most. (I should have said that better.)",4,LOL good & obviously aimed for the girls,1292457600,"12 16, 2010",2010,1757,"['MAN', 'REVIEWING', 'CHONDA', 'PIERCE', 'FIRST', 'Saints', 'preserve', 'Chonda', 'will', 'be', 'man-bashing', 'next', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'being', '1st', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'Did', 'Say', 'Out', 'Loud', 'DVD', 'was', 'wife', 'gift', 'girl-friend', 'watched', 'too', 'Have', 'admit', 'had', 'laughing-out-loud', 'times', 'snickering', 'more', 'also', 'smiling', 'catching', 'few', 'man-shots', 'aimed', 'gents', 'most', 'live', 'audience', 'was', 'girls-of', 'ages.Chonda', 'Christian', 'Phyllis', 'Diller', 'fun', 'herself', 'fast-paced', 'self-bashing', 'comedienne', 'who', 'often', 'audience', 'late', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'Leave', 'man', 'compare', 'Chonda', 'male', 'Sorry', 'girls', 'use', 'line', ""n't"", 'tha-at', 'pree-cious', 'topic', 'sacred', 'performing', 'World', 'Outreach', 'Church', 'Murfreesburo', 'TN', 'claimed', 'hometown.Her', 'stand-up', 'routine', 'followed', 'question', 'answer', 'session', 'proving', 'impromptu', 'comedy', 'peak', 'performance', 'Then', 'audience', 'request', 'Chonda', 'Story', 'Life', 'words/music', 'Shannon', 'Werelberg', 'Chonda', 'Pierce', 'nice', 'voice', 'as', 'surprising', 'male', 'comedian', 'Gomer', 'Pyle', 'Jim', 'Nabors', 'southern', 'drawl', 'belle', 'status', 'similar', 'Nabors', 'negligible', 'once', 'music', 'Jim', 'Blessed', 'Assurance', 'performed', 'vocally', 'DVD', 'credits', 'comical', 'added', 'insertion', ""'ll"", 'not', 'ruin', 'surprise', 'subtitles', 'CC', 'Audio', 'Format', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Stereo', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Surround.My', 'vote', 'was', '4', 'stars', 'thinking', 'might', 'be', 'higher', 'women', 'asked', 'wife', 'said', '4', 'as', 'well', 'liked', 'Chonda', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Prettyville', 'better.Good', 'Christian', 'comedy', 'fit', 'family', 'gals', 'will', 'gain', 'most', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'better']",N/A
