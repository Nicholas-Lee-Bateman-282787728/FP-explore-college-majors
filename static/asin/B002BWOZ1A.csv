1260368,ASBH6WZRY79PN,B002BWOZ1A,"C. B. Miller ""C B Miller""","[8, 10]","The film (DVD) follows Rochus Misch, the last living survivor (witness) as to Hitler and the final days in the F&uuml;hrerbunker in Berlin (1945). Given the fact Misch was born in 1917, he still has a sound mind and gets around pretty well. The film shows his modest home in Berlin where he has lived these many years. His devoted housekeeper is interviewed and she gives her views on Misch and Hitler. She tells how there is a disconnect between what she learned in school and the stories Misch has told her.The best part of the film is when Misch is going through his old wartime photos and tells anecdotal stories about the people and places shown. There was not enough time spent on that in the film. The filmmakers spent a lot of time interviewing Misch's adult daughter and showing how she views things differently from her father. I will say it is of some interest to show the family dynamitics in relation to Germany's past, but again, I would have liked to hear more as to Misch's interactions with Hitler and ""the inner circle"". In the end, the World War II buff and student of German history will find the film interesting, keeping in mind the caveat mentioned above.",3,The last survivor from the Berlin Bunker...,1302480000,"04 11, 2011",2011,1178,"['film', 'DVD', 'Rochus', 'Misch', 'last', 'living', 'survivor', 'witness', 'Hitler', 'final', 'days', 'F', 'uuml', 'hrerbunker', 'Berlin', '1945', 'Given', 'fact', 'Misch', 'was', 'born', '1917', 'still', 'sound', 'mind', 'around', 'pretty', 'well', 'film', 'modest', 'home', 'Berlin', 'where', 'lived', 'many', 'years', 'devoted', 'housekeeper', 'interviewed', 'views', 'Misch', 'Hitler', 'how', 'disconnect', 'what', 'learned', 'school', 'stories', 'Misch', 'told', 'her.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'when', 'Misch', 'going', 'old', 'wartime', 'photos', 'tells', 'anecdotal', 'stories', 'people', 'places', 'shown', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'spent', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'interviewing', 'Misch', 'adult', 'daughter', 'showing', 'how', 'things', 'differently', 'father', 'will', 'say', 'interest', 'show', 'family', 'dynamitics', 'relation', 'Germany', 'past', 'again', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'hear', 'more', 'Misch', 'interactions', 'Hitler', 'inner', 'circle', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'buff', 'student', 'German', 'history', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'interesting', 'keeping', 'mind', 'caveat', 'mentioned']",The Last Witness

He clearly describes the other side of Hitler, which at the least helps to put Hitler in the realm of a human being.

This Man never got to see first hand the Evil cruel side of Hitler, therefore he can only speak of what his experience was. It was just his post as a personal aid to Hitler and he was not given inside info about Hitler's master plan.

This is a DOCUMENTARY. The gentleman in the film is in his 90s and very alert and intelligent and (articulate). He has a treasure trove of photos from both Hitler and Ava Braun and the Hitler inner circle. HIS story is good but he ""loves"" the attention and it shows. He comes across as a very likeable man who has a bit of history to share. He does enlightening details about the LAST hours in the BUNKER for Hitler and Braun and even Goebbels and his family. He has become a local ""celebrity"" of a sorts. His daughter is also interviewed and she speaks very good English. She was born in the 1940's. Her Father was in prison for years and she clearly picked up anti Nazi feelings from her Family and EDUCATION. She is not closed to her father and she speaks out about it. THE HOUSEKEEPER is the third person interviewed and we see her busy ""cleaning"" what is amazing is her ATTITUDE that history is wrong and the EX NAZI is right about the killing of the Jews. This is both SAD and interesting. This is told mostly in German with excellent subtitles. I would recommend it as a CHARACTER STUDY on history.

If this was to be an hour-long documentary it wasn't going to waste anymore of my time by filming nothing but fluff, which has or had nothing to do with the Second World War.  It took more than three minutes for the film to convey one line, and only one line, that the main character took photos of Hitler, and from what I saw, not very good photos.
