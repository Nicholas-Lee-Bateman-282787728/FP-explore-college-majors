Chris Perry was a great addition to the cast and it was fun trying to guess who he was and whether he was good or bad. Almost every epsoide was very good and funny. Wyatt contiuned his mischief with his powers causing all kinds of chaos. Piper, Phoebe and Paige were as wonderful as always. Piper is separated from Leo who became an Elder she focuses her energy on protecting Wyatt and dating again.

1003924,A1ZB49F18WK861,B000GG4Y6O,"Arg! ""Night_Hawk07""","[0, 0]","I began watching ""Charmed"" at the end of the third season which was probably considered one of the series' high points. As the show went on, its quality suffered. Still, being the avid collector I am, I have been buying every season as it came out and all of them have been stellar until season 5 (which was just extremely mediocre). I didn't have high hopes for season 6 either because from memory of watching it as it originally aired on the WB, I didn't enjoy it.Now, watching it again on DVD, it seems the season excels when not having to deal with repeats. That's not to say its continuity is reliant on no repeats, it's just that there are several lackluster episodes in the beginning and having to wait weeks between weeks after each one gets tiresome. On DVD, after watching a mediocre episode you can just skip to the next one.The season begins with ""Valhalley of the Dolls"" which is one of the worst season premieres in the history of the show. Luckily, as the season progresses it gets better but it doesn't help the the new addition of Drew Fuller as Chris brings down the quality. Apart from being some good eye-candy, the actor just cannot act.Save for all of those complaints, the other aspects of the show get better. The season finale is one of the best ""Charmed"" has ever had since  season 3.Great storylines, some bad acting, overall a pretty good season.",4,Better than what I remembered,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,1374,"['began', 'watching', 'Charmed', 'end', 'third', 'season', 'was', 'probably', 'considered', 'one', 'series', 'high', 'points', 'show', 'went', 'quality', 'suffered', 'Still', 'being', 'avid', 'collector', 'am', 'have', 'been', 'buying', 'season', 'came', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'stellar', 'season', '5', 'was', 'just', 'extremely', 'mediocre', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'season', '6', 'memory', 'watching', 'originally', 'aired', 'WB', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'it.Now', 'watching', 'again', 'DVD', 'season', 'excels', 'when', 'not', 'having', 'deal', 'repeats', 'not', 'say', 'continuity', 'reliant', 'repeats', 'just', 'are', 'several', 'lackluster', 'episodes', 'beginning', 'having', 'wait', 'weeks', 'weeks', 'one', 'tiresome', 'DVD', 'watching', 'mediocre', 'episode', 'can', 'just', 'skip', 'next', 'one.The', 'season', 'Valhalley', 'Dolls', 'one', 'worst', 'season', 'premieres', 'history', 'show', 'Luckily', 'season', 'better', ""n't"", 'help', 'new', 'addition', 'Drew', 'Fuller', 'Chris', 'down', 'quality', 'Apart', 'being', 'good', 'eye-candy', 'actor', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'act.Save', 'complaints', 'other', 'aspects', 'show', 'get', 'better', 'season', 'finale', 'one', 'best', 'Charmed', 'ever', 'had', 'season', '3.Great', 'storylines', 'bad', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'season']",Charmed: Season 6

And who is back to fight these monsters? The Charmed Ones: PIPER HALLIWELL (again played by the beautiful Holly Marie Combs), PHOEBE HALLIWELL (again played by the beautiful Alyssa Milano), & PAIGE MATTHEWS (again played by the beautiful Rose McGowan).""Valhalley of the Dolls (Part 1)""Even though Leo is gone, Piper is in a surprisingly good mood, leading Paige to suspect that Leo altered Piper's memory. However, Paige's spell to restore Piper's memory accidentally causes total amnesia. Calling upon Leo for help, Phoebe and Paige discover that he is being held captive on the Island of Valhalla, a mythical place ruled by warrior-maidens.

Ignoring Piper and Phoebe's plea to not get involved, Paige sells her soul to Zahn in order to free Larry's.""Sword and the City""The Lady of the Lake appears before the Charmed Ones, pleading for their help in protecting Excalibur, the legendary Sword in the Stone.""Little Monsters""After vanquishing a Manticore demon, Piper, Phoebe and Paige become foster parents to its orphaned half-Manticore infant.

Meanwhile, Phoebe is sent on a vision quest by Enola, a young shaman student, and gets a glimpse into the future, where she discovers Chris' true identity.""I Dream of Phoebe""Phoebe frees a genie, Jinny, from a bottle, only to find that she has been tricked into becoming the genie herself.

During the attack, Chris is infected with the Demon's venom, causing him to mutate into a spider.""Crimes and Witch Demeanors""When Phoebe and Paige are caught on tape using their powers, the Cleaners, who prevent the exposure of magic, cover up the situation by implicating Darryl as a murderer and sending him to death row.

To prevent Paige from executing his plan, Phoebe goes undercover as one of Mr. Wrong's Demonatrix assassins.""Witch Wars""Aware that Piper, Phoebe and Paige are on the verge of discovering that he is after Wyatt, Gideon conspires with two demons to make the girls part of Witch Wars, a new demonic reality television show where demon contestants compete in a series of contests to hunt down the Charmed Ones, with the winning demon acquiring the witches' powers.""It's a Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad World (Part 1)""Under the guise of sending Chris back to the future, Gideon creates a portal that puts Chris and Leo in a mirrored world where evil prevails. Phoebe and Paige travel to the parallel universe to rescue Chris and Leo, only to find themselves in a battle with their evil counterparts. Unable to vanquish one another, both sets of sisters realize that Wyatt is unprotected and in danger from Gideon.""It's a Bad, Bad, Bad, Bad World (Part 2)""Upon returning to their own world, Phoebe and Paige realize that their world is now too good, and every little infraction is a capital offense. The shift between universes causes Piper's memory to be erased, and Gideon tricks Piper into casting a spell on Phoebe and Paige so that they, too, forget Gideon's evil intentions. With the Charmed sisters under the spell, Leo and Chris are left to stop Gideon from completing his plan. Meanwhile, Piper gives birth to baby Chris.Another awesome season and we (THE CHAMRED FANS) owe it all to Piper, Phoebe, & Paige.

This was the season where I became so bored with all they were doing that I actually tuned out half way through the season.  I picked up the DVDs with the intent of giving it a second chance, but I was uninterested to the end.  There are three main reasons I could hardly stand the show at this point: the dialogue is repetitive and ridiculous, the actor playing Chris has virtually no range or charisma regardless of his handsome features, and virtually every episode centers around either protecting or saving Wyatt from demons.  I can't remember how many times I heard Piper exclaim, ""I'm not interested in chasing demons right now.  I'm only interested in protecting Wyatt.""  I very nearly did not pick up season 7 as a result of this creative burnout; but that would have been a mistake as season 7 is a surprise return to form for the Charmed Ones.  If I ever go back and watch the series from beginning to end again I will undoubtedly skip season 6 along my journey.  Two stars, not one, as I am and will forever be a fan of the show.

The show is charming and light with occasional dark elements. The sisters are likeable and funny and wear a number of cute outfits (which you probably would not *actually* wear in S.F. due to fact that its often windy and foggy), but are cute to look at nontheless.There were things I liked: The separation of Leo and Piper, the introduction of Chris (their new white-lighter), and elements I was 'meh' about: Too much focus on baby Wyatt, the 'magic school ala Harry Potter,' the sister's constant obsession with having their own lives got to be a bit of a drag, and the character of Paige occasionally overshadowing the other characters.If you are a fan of the series, Season Six was a good entry. If I had a bone to pick with this series, I would've liked to see more solidarity between the sisters. I think they should be beyond the phase of selfish pursuits and using ther powers for personal gain. Part of being a charmed one is about sacrifice and the sisters still act selfish, particularly Paige and Phoebe which is a bit of a drag.4 stars.
