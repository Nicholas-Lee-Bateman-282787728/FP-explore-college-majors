1269462,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B002ID098A,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[9, 9]","Speaking as someone who owns several compilation sets from distributors such as Mill Creek, TCG Direct and others, as well as a few from Pop Flix, I have to say that I've found the Pop Flix the best value all around.  Taking into consideration the factors of title selection, the condition of the film stock, layout, amount of films per disc and overall price, they are an excellent way for me to see unfamiliar films at what I consider to be a reasonable  price, albeit slightly more expensive than similar sets from other companies.  The biggest fault I've found with them so far is that I've found several sets with a DVD rattling around loose inside the sealed case.This particular collection has other faults - none of the transfers are in very good condition, especially considering the blurb on the front of the case that touts digital re-mastering and sound enhancement.  Perhaps these films were drastically worse before, but I feel as though very little effort went into this 're-mastering'.  Still, each film was watchable, and I don't remember any significant audio problems.  The worst, to my mind, was THE STRANGER, which had a strange, 'juddering' look to the film, as if every other frame were clipped out of the reel, and THE RED HOUSE, which had an extremely scratchy audio sound for the first part of the film.All of the films were presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio, all were in black and white, and all audio was 2 channel dolby digital.  There were no subtitles to any of the films, and no other special features save a slideshow of posters and lobby cards of the films contained on each disc.  I've written reviews for most of the films on the individual product pages, but here's a quick rundown on what I thought was best to worst.The Stranger***1/2 - Edward G. Robinson hunts down former Nazi Orson Welles in Connecticut.  Intelligent and captivating, marred by film stock problems.The Scar***1/2 - Doppelganger story starring Paul Henreid and Joan Bennett.  While the story stretches credulity, the cinematography in this one bumps it up from three stars to three and a half.Scarlet Street*** - Mid-life crisis sufferer Edward G. Robinson runs into a young, vivacious Joan Bennett.  Technically a better film than the three stars might indicate, it's too bleak for me.Woman on the Run*** Ann Sheridan's husband is in hiding after witnessing a murder, and it's up to her to find him before the killer does.  Another toss-up between three and four stars, but the positives dragged down by too many outside scenes filmed in the studio - and it looks like it.Inner Sanctum**1/2 - A murderer is trapped by floods and rising rivers to remain near the scene of the crime.  Too many character actors spoil the broth.The Red House**1/2 - Edward G. Robinson, farmer, spends his life haunted by one night in the red house.  Starts out suspenseful, but turns mundane and predictable.  Look for an alluring young Julie London.Although I've rated these films rather low, it is a reflection of what I believe their overall appeal is.  For myself, I found elements in all of them that I enjoyed, which is why I rate the entire collection at four stars.  All in all, an entirely reasonable way to acquaint myself with six films I'd never seen.As with most Pop Flix collections, this six film set is also bundled together with another six film setMurder & Mayhem Collection.  That new set is also namedMurder & Mayhem Collection, which makes things more confusing, but is a better deal than buying each six film set separately.  Additionally, three of these films are available on blu-ray (THE STRANGER, THE RED HOUSE, and SCARLET STREET).  While this Pop Flix collection might be sufficient for someone attempting to see if these films were of interest, fans might want to look to the hi-def versions for their collections.",4,Slightly better than average films - great package and price,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,3831,"['Speaking', 'someone', 'who', 'several', 'compilation', 'sets', 'distributors', 'such', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'TCG', 'Direct', 'others', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'Pop', 'Flix', 'have', 'say', ""'ve"", 'found', 'Pop', 'Flix', 'best', 'value', 'Taking', 'consideration', 'factors', 'title', 'selection', 'condition', 'film', 'stock', 'layout', 'amount', 'films', 'disc', 'overall', 'price', 'are', 'excellent', 'way', 'see', 'unfamiliar', 'films', 'what', 'consider', 'be', 'reasonable', 'price', 'slightly', 'more', 'expensive', 'similar', 'sets', 'other', 'companies', 'biggest', 'fault', ""'ve"", 'found', 'so', 'far', ""'ve"", 'found', 'several', 'sets', 'DVD', 'rattling', 'around', 'loose', 'sealed', 'case.This', 'particular', 'collection', 'other', 'faults', 'none', 'transfers', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'condition', 'especially', 'considering', 'blurb', 'front', 'case', 'digital', 're-mastering', 'sound', 'enhancement', 'Perhaps', 'films', 'were', 'drastically', 'worse', 'feel', 'very', 'little', 'effort', 'went', ""'re-mastering"", 'Still', 'film', 'was', 'watchable', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'significant', 'audio', 'problems', 'worst', 'mind', 'was', 'THE', 'STRANGER', 'had', 'strange', ""'juddering"", 'look', 'film', 'other', 'frame', 'were', 'clipped', 'reel', 'THE', 'RED', 'HOUSE', 'had', 'extremely', 'scratchy', 'audio', 'sound', 'first', 'part', 'film.All', 'films', 'were', 'presented', '1.33:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'were', 'black', 'white', 'audio', 'was', '2', 'channel', 'dolby', 'digital', 'were', 'subtitles', 'films', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'save', 'slideshow', 'posters', 'lobby', 'cards', 'films', 'contained', 'disc', ""'ve"", 'written', 'reviews', 'most', 'films', 'individual', 'product', 'pages', 'here', 'quick', 'rundown', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'best', 'worst.The', 'Stranger***1/2', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'down', 'former', 'Nazi', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Connecticut', 'Intelligent', 'captivating', 'marred', 'film', 'stock', 'problems.The', 'Scar***1/2', 'Doppelganger', 'story', 'starring', 'Paul', 'Henreid', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'story', 'stretches', 'credulity', 'cinematography', 'one', 'bumps', 'up', 'three', 'stars', 'three', 'half.Scarlet', 'Street***', 'Mid-life', 'crisis', 'sufferer', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'young', 'vivacious', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'Technically', 'better', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'might', 'indicate', 'too', 'bleak', 'me.Woman', 'Run***', 'Ann', 'Sheridan', 'husband', 'hiding', 'witnessing', 'murder', 'up', 'find', 'killer', 'toss-up', 'three', 'four', 'stars', 'positives', 'dragged', 'down', 'too', 'many', 'outside', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'studio', 'it.Inner', 'Sanctum**1/2', 'murderer', 'trapped', 'floods', 'rising', 'rivers', 'remain', 'scene', 'crime', 'Too', 'many', 'character', 'actors', 'spoil', 'broth.The', 'Red', 'House**1/2', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'farmer', 'life', 'haunted', 'one', 'night', 'red', 'house', 'out', 'suspenseful', 'mundane', 'predictable', 'Look', 'alluring', 'young', 'Julie', 'London.Although', ""'ve"", 'rated', 'films', 'rather', 'low', 'reflection', 'what', 'believe', 'overall', 'appeal', 'found', 'elements', 'enjoyed', 'why', 'rate', 'entire', 'collection', 'four', 'stars', 'entirely', 'reasonable', 'way', 'acquaint', 'six', 'films', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen.As', 'most', 'Pop', 'Flix', 'collections', 'six', 'film', 'set', 'also', 'bundled', 'together', 'six', 'film', 'setMurder', 'Mayhem', 'Collection', 'new', 'set', 'also', 'namedMurder', 'Mayhem', 'Collection', 'things', 'more', 'confusing', 'better', 'deal', 'buying', 'six', 'film', 'set', 'separately', 'Additionally', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'available', 'blu-ray', 'THE', 'STRANGER', 'THE', 'RED', 'HOUSE', 'SCARLET', 'STREET', 'Pop', 'Flix', 'collection', 'might', 'be', 'sufficient', 'someone', 'attempting', 'see', 'films', 'were', 'interest', 'fans', 'might', 'want', 'look', 'hi-def', 'versions', 'collections']",N/A
1269463,AAG0TENINMYCA,B002ID098A,"D. D. Ames ""Big Daddy""","[20, 23]","Scarlett Street - When a man in mid-life crisis befriends a young woman, her venal fianc&eacute; persuades her to con him out of some of the fortune she thinks he has. Robinson at his ""sleazy"" best, Duryea the classic ""creep"" and Bennett caught in between. Never get tired of watching this one, but don't drink while viewing. Could get too depressing.The Red House - Pete and Ellen have reared Meg as their own, ever since she was a baby and her parents took off. Now a teen, Meg convinces her friend Nath to come help with chores on the farm: Pete isn't getting around on his wooden leg like he used to. When Nath insists on using a short cut home through the woods, Pete gets quite agitated and warns him of screams in the night, of terrors associated with the red house. Curious, Meg and Nath ignore his warnings and begin exploring. Meg begins falling in love with Nath, but his girlfriend Tibby has other plans for him. Meanwhile they all get closer to real danger and the dark secret of the red house. Scared me so bad I was afraid to get up and make that second ham and cheese.The Scar (aka Hollow Triumph) - Pursued by the big-time gambler he robbed, John Muller takes a new identity, with ironic results. Producers thought the movie was so bad they renamed it, but you'll be surprised. It's a sleeper and is really worth watching.The Stranger - An investigator from the War Crimes Commission travels to Connecticut to find an infamous Nazi. Robinson, Welles, and Young at their very best. It's a keeper.Woman On The Run - Frank Johnson flees police after becoming an eyewitness to murder. He is pursued around scenic San Francisco by his wife, a reporter, the police, and... the real murderer. Ann Sheridan is always a joy to watch.Inner Sanctum - A man fleeing the police after having committed a murder hides out in a boarding house in a small town. An okay movie.
