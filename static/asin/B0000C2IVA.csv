From the moment she says ""I'm dead"" to the moment Jack goes to jail this flick is perfect and her performance as a devastated young woman on a downward spiral is painfully beautiful.  Unfortunately, some clumsy dialog early in the flick and at the end made me wince but it wasn't enough to dilute the power of what Miss Ayanna did.  This gal knows pain and was able to communicate it with breath taking honesty.  And did I mention Adrian Brody?  His performance is so real and watchable it's hard to understand how this movie passed so quickly under the radar.  But all involved, including the director who did some wonderful things especially in that section I referred to above, should know that this movie will be penetrating the popular conciousness for decades to come.

773130,A1ERZIZ48CBCSB,B0000C2IVA,Charismatic Creature,"[7, 12]","Without Adrien Brody's timely Oscar win, this slow moving indie would not have seen the light of day. Brody is badly miscast as a NYC lowlife, a professional criminal who stages hotel robberies of dimwitted Asian tourists while wearing police getup.He meets and falls in love with a brilliant young college student, Claire and start an affair...first she falls for him, he cheats on her to drive her away. Then she begins a frightening dissent into prostitution and suicide, while Jack (Brody) reveals that he really is in love with her.This probably makes it sound better than it is. The script is confusing -- is Claire a college freshman or a graduate student in Genetics? This is kinda important, because we evaluate her character and her actions differently if she is a 18 yr old virgin (which is hinted at) or a more mature 22 yr old. The actress, Charlotte Ayanna, is very attractive; she resembles Kimberly Williams (Father of the Bride), but she is way, way out of her depth once the role calls for her to descend into mental illness and self destruction. There is no hint given why the breakup of this rather shallow, short term love affair would have her turning tricks (without condoms) on street corners or cutting her wrists (which is why we really need to know if she is a teenager or in her 20s). Why is it inside of her that is so needy and immature? We never find out.Adrien Brody, who is talented and handsome in an unusual way -- very thin, expressive face and huge puppy dog eyes -- is just completely the wrong physical type for the part of a sleazy down and out loser. I wonder what casting genius thought of this? He's so slight and frail looking when he puts on a police uniform, you think of a kid dressing up for Halloween -- it's imposible to believe even Japanese tourists take him seriously. Some actors are handicapped by having a &quot;look&quot; that limits their parts, and Mr. Brody's &quot;look&quot; screams aristocratic Jewish intellectual.It's even more confusing when Jack is revealed to be a wannabe writer, who collects first edition books and reads Melville (apparently not any comtemporary writers, though). This is the kind of unbelievable detail that just sinks his characterization. So is his amazing turnaround in prison, where he gives up crime for writing and*SPOILER ALERT*gets back together with Claire, the least plausible detail in the film. Why would she take this apalling cad back into her life? And how did she recover from mental illness, a suicide attempt, lengthy stay in psychiatric hospital, and still manage to return to college, graduate and get a job in a medical lab...all in two years? Never mind. The filmmaker just wanted to tack on a happy ending! But it's jarring and inappropriate.Like most not-very-good low budget films, the main problem isn't the lack of big stars, loud music, computer graphics, car chases etc, but a BAD SCRIPT. The film actually has a nice gritty, unglamorized look to it, and the love scenes -- filmed in an arty, non-linear way -- are appealing. But the story is less convincing than some sci fi thriller with giant aliens.If you adored Adrien Brody in &quot;The Pianist&quot;, you might want to catch this just to see him in contemporary clothing, but otherwise, it's a waste and very boring...a movie that probably would have never been released if he had been passed voter for that Oscar.",2,slow direct-to-video indie,1077148800,"02 19, 2004",2004,3389,"['Adrien', 'Brody', 'timely', 'Oscar', 'win', 'slow', 'moving', 'indie', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'Brody', 'badly', 'miscast', 'NYC', 'lowlife', 'professional', 'criminal', 'who', 'hotel', 'robberies', 'dimwitted', 'Asian', 'tourists', 'wearing', 'police', 'getup.He', 'meets', 'falls', 'love', 'brilliant', 'young', 'college', 'student', 'Claire', 'start', 'affair', 'first', 'drive', 'away', 'Then', 'frightening', 'dissent', 'prostitution', 'suicide', 'Jack', 'Brody', 'really', 'love', 'her.This', 'probably', 'sound', 'better', 'script', 'confusing', 'Claire', 'college', 'freshman', 'graduate', 'student', 'Genetics', 'kinda', 'important', 'evaluate', 'character', 'actions', 'differently', '18', 'yr', 'old', 'virgin', 'hinted', 'more', 'mature', '22', 'yr', 'old', 'actress', 'Charlotte', 'Ayanna', 'very', 'attractive', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'Father', 'Bride', 'way', 'way', 'depth', 'role', 'descend', 'mental', 'illness', 'self', 'destruction', 'hint', 'given', 'why', 'breakup', 'rather', 'shallow', 'short', 'term', 'affair', 'would', 'have', 'turning', 'tricks', 'condoms', 'street', 'corners', 'cutting', 'wrists', 'why', 'really', 'need', 'know', 'teenager', '20s', 'Why', 'so', 'needy', 'immature', 'never', 'find', 'out.Adrien', 'Brody', 'who', 'talented', 'handsome', 'unusual', 'way', 'very', 'thin', 'expressive', 'face', 'huge', 'puppy', 'dog', 'eyes', 'just', 'completely', 'wrong', 'physical', 'type', 'part', 'sleazy', 'down', 'loser', 'wonder', 'what', 'casting', 'genius', 'thought', 'so', 'slight', 'frail', 'looking', 'when', 'police', 'uniform', 'think', 'kid', 'dressing', 'up', 'Halloween', 'imposible', 'believe', 'even', 'Japanese', 'tourists', 'take', 'seriously', 'actors', 'are', 'handicapped', 'having', 'quot', 'quot', 'parts', 'Mr.', 'Brody', 'quot', 'quot', 'aristocratic', 'Jewish', 'intellectual.It', 'even', 'more', 'confusing', 'when', 'Jack', 'revealed', 'be', 'wannabe', 'writer', 'who', 'first', 'edition', 'books', 'reads', 'Melville', 'apparently', 'not', 'comtemporary', 'writers', 'though', 'kind', 'unbelievable', 'detail', 'just', 'characterization', 'amazing', 'turnaround', 'prison', 'where', 'up', 'crime', 'writing', 'and*SPOILER', 'ALERT*gets', 'back', 'together', 'Claire', 'least', 'plausible', 'detail', 'film', 'Why', 'would', 'take', 'apalling', 'cad', 'back', 'life', 'how', 'did', 'recover', 'mental', 'illness', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'lengthy', 'stay', 'psychiatric', 'hospital', 'still', 'manage', 'return', 'college', 'graduate', 'get', 'job', 'medical', 'lab', 'two', 'years', 'Never', 'mind', 'filmmaker', 'just', 'wanted', 'tack', 'happy', 'ending', 'jarring', 'inappropriate.Like', 'most', 'not-very-good', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'main', 'problem', ""n't"", 'lack', 'big', 'stars', 'loud', 'music', 'computer', 'graphics', 'car', 'chases', 'etc', 'BAD', 'SCRIPT', 'film', 'actually', 'nice', 'gritty', 'unglamorized', 'look', 'love', 'scenes', 'filmed', 'arty', 'non-linear', 'way', 'are', 'appealing', 'story', 'less', 'convincing', 'sci', 'fi', 'thriller', 'giant', 'aliens.If', 'adored', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'quot', 'Pianist', 'quot', 'might', 'want', 'catch', 'just', 'see', 'contemporary', 'clothing', 'otherwise', 'waste', 'very', 'boring', 'movie', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'had', 'been', 'passed', 'voter', 'Oscar']",N/A

773132,A1IPFS2WVJ1XP8,B0000C2IVA,Dorian Tenore-Bartilucci,"[2, 13]","LOVE THE HARD WAY (LtHW) and TEN BENNY/NOTHING TO LOSE would be an appropriate Adrien Brody double-feature because both had me muttering ""Dumbass!"" every time the protagonists acted like jerks. But don't blame Brody; he and the cast did their best with the material they had. LtHW was a shelved indie released to cash in on Brody's post-Oscar fame. Alas, this alleged romantic crime drama proves that some unreleased films should stay that way! Maybe something got lost in translation as German co-writer/director Peter Sehr and French co-writer Marie Noelle adapted a Chinese novel into a New York story with mostly American characters. Guess I should've sensed trouble when antihero Jack (Brody) wears a snakeskin jacket obviously intended to make him look cool; I couldn't help thinking, ""Nicolas Cage called from the set of WILD AT HEART; he wants his jacket back!"" Brody looks hot despite the heavyhanded ""cool"" touches, which at least renders the film more watchable, as does LtHW's striking use of NYC locations like the now-defunct Screening Room, where heroine Claire (Charlotte Ayanna) works part-time, and a former office building in the South Bronx that Jack and his partner-in-crime Charlie (Jon Seda) call home. Jack and Charlie's world brings to mind the grim-and-gritty quality of 1970s NYC-set thrillers (or maybe it's just the DVD's dingy print :-). The guys support themselves with thievery and con jobs. Their female confederates play hookers luring unsuspecting foreign businessmen in posh Manhattan hotels, only to have Jack and Charlie bust in, posing as cops willing to accept ""bribes"" from the eager-for-secrecy businessmen. These scams are LtHW's best bits, but then, I enjoy con games as long as they're only in movies! :-) However, Jack supposedly has a poet's soul beneath his streetwise demeanor, writing the Great American Pulp Fiction Novel in his spare time. He meets clean-cut Columbia University student Claire, and as the apparent opposites attract, the film turns schizoid. Despite his attraction to her, Jack realizes he and Claire are from different worlds -- but when he dumps her, the film stops being a grim-and-gritty crime drama and becomes a different 1970s-style film: one of those downbeat, joyless sex dramas that were so prevalent back then.  After the breakup, angelic Claire becomes an ""avenging angel"" (her words) as she refuses to take no for an answer (Jack's told her all along what a scoundrel he is, so you'd think she'd have seen it coming -- especially after catching him in bed with one of the bogus ""hookers""!), sending everyone involved on a downward spiral as I kept checking the clock to see how much longer this dreariness would go on. The actors are fine, but the script feels like a series of sample film noir scenes somebody wrote for film school, not a well-rounded story with any sense of internal logic. Though Brody's acting is terrific and he looks great (despite that jacket :-), the script and sluggish pacing defeats him, rendering Jack more obnoxious and smug than sexy and charismatic. Jack and Charlie are apparently supposed to be lovable rogues, but when Claire's ex and his Columbia U. pals start a fight with Jack and Charlie at a local night spot, I rooted for the collegians to mop the floor with them. (SPOILER ALERT...I cheered aloud when Detective Linda Fox finally catches the schemers red-handed and hauls 'em to the hoosegow for a 2-year stretch!...END SPOILER ALERT) As Claire, pretty Ayanna has a likable presence. She and Brody generate heat in their love scenes (which at least perk up the dour proceedings -- especially Brody's lean, sexy physique! Yum! :-), but screenwriters Sehr and Noelle seem unsure what she's supposed to be. Good-girl Claire is described as complex and multifaceted, but she merely comes off as erratic: first she's a jaded banterer, then a sweet, lovestruck babe-in-the-woods, then a possessive, self-destructive FATAL ATTRACTION type. Then sleazeball Jack suddenly shows a sensitive side as well as literary aspirations, schlepping around in a guilt-ridden, devastated daze as Claire shoehorns herself into the hooker/businessman scam, degrading herself in every way to teach Jack a lesson. Apart from the stupidity of degrading yourself instead of degrading the person who's done you wrong, if Sehr and Noelle wanted to make a movie about such a person, why didn't they foreshadow the characters' nutjob potential instead of having it happen out of nowhere? As I watched this DVD, I felt like I was switching channels between several different glum, no-fun movies. Still, every so often there are amusing scenes taunting us with what LtHW might've been with better writing and directing; for example, Jack has a tape of traffic noises with which he fools people who call him on his cell phone wondering where he is. As a writer, I also enjoyed the scenes with Jack in his self-storage space writing his novel-in-progress. Pam Grier gives the film wit and style as Linda Fox, the undercover detective playing cat-and-mouse with Jack and Charlie. When Fox catches Jack with the faux hookers' hotel room number, #1865, and tries to nail him with it, the guys cover up by pretending they're history buffs (Jack: ""{1865 is} the year of Lee's surrender at Appomattox."" Charlie: ""It was a dark day for the Confederacy, ma'am.""). Like Claire's loony behavior, this bit of daftness comes from nowhere, but at least it's funny and clever. Another atypically breezy scene: the playful ""interview"" between Jack and ""future Nobel Prize winner"" Claire. Too bad the fun's leeched from even that scene later on when we hear a tape of it under tragic circumstances; it's like LtHW hates to actually *entertain* the audience for long. The DVD packaging screams ""Academy Award Winner* Adrien Brody,"" with the asterisk meaning ""*For Best Actor in 2002's THE PIANIST."" I half-expected to see another asterisk next to the banner ""'Two BIG Thumbs UP' -- Ebert & Roeper,"" since I can't imagine why they gave this depressing mess even one little thumb up, let alone 2 BIG Thumbs Up. To paraphrase Webb Wilder in HORROR HAYRIDE, I gave it a finger! :-) Fans of NYC and the film's cast may find the documentary amongst the DVD's extras worth a look, though even *that* is longer than it really needs to be.",2,"What I Did For LOVE...: Watched This Bummer, That's What!",1116288000,"05 17, 2005",2005,6302,"['LOVE', 'THE', 'HARD', 'WAY', 'LtHW', 'TEN', 'BENNY/NOTHING', 'TO', 'LOSE',

Claire is a grad student who gets straight A's, wanting to rebel she gets with Jack, the petty thief and secret writer, whose world is turned up upside-down by a combination of sex, true love, and loyalty. This film was very intense & leaves you thinking. Anyone, esp. women, who has fallen in love with a ""dangerous/mysterious"" type will surely relate to this because stories like hers are very common, although not everybody goes to such extremes.Adrien Brody is an excellent actor and gives an interesting and subtle performance that he slowly let us in to the interior that lies under the criminal, streetwise exterior. The script doesn't actually explain how Jack Grace became the way he is. The sketchy details about his background he provides Claire could be a figment of his overactive imagination. So all we can do is watch Claire sink lower and lower, but eventually redeem herself. Charlotte Ayanna's performance as Claire was wonderful she has depicted this role without any annoying mannerisms and has pushed some realistic traits into her character. Pam Grier is also good in her ""almost-cameo"" role as the police officer who comes in and out of the lead characters' lives throughout the film as well as Jon Seda as Jack partner in crime and close friend.`Love The Hard Way' is a bitter sweet love story that will make you think. It also provides some dark mysterious qualities. Peter Sehr is a great director. The cinematography and use of colors that he captures are wonderful. The plot is at once very unconventional, given that it isn't quite as linear as most...and yet has all the elements necessary for a successful drama.

Towards the end I thought Claire had died because she had sliced her wrist. And I couldn't help but feel a surge of coldness towards Jack [Adrien Brody] for not admitting how he really felt about Claire. And I couldn't help but laugh and say that's just what you get when he nearly got stabbed to death when he was in jail. He needed to feel the pain Claire felt, when he left her. This movie I have been sending to all my friends and people who I use to date. To show them, that that is not the kind of man you want to be, a hustler. This movie has a powerful lesson to it about love, crime and life. I felt sorry for Jack because his dad Od' when he was 6 and his mom traded him for her habit and he was forced to live in a boy's home. He didn't know about love, or how to even treat girls. The streets is what taught him what he knows. And then there is Claire, the college student who never had sex [until she meets Jack] and she doesn't know what he has been through. Until she emerses herself into his world of pretty much hurt, pain and crime. It's a good movie and has a lot of lessons to it. Lessons like ""Just because it started out bad, doesn't mean it has to end bad."" and ""All it takes is one bad person to mess you up."" Claire could have easily stayed away from Jack and focused on her studies and got a better man. I think the chemistry was just there. And she thought she was getting something faster. This movie has numerous lessons to it about life. Lessons I can't possibly name. This movie had me laughing, crying, thinking and pondering all at different times.

While every step of the story stairacse is not credible, every moment of the chemistry between the two very beautiful leads is credible and burns up the screen (big or little) with passion.The story, and the personal interactions between the characters, are all aided by on-location filming in gritty and grimy sections of New York City. The photography is noirish with dark streets, half-lit rooms, rainy evenings and all the trappings of a Richard Widmark crime drama from 1955. A good cast of relative unknowns supports the two leads in this interesting modern take on film noir.Also look for Adrien Brody in two other fine dramas -- his Academy Award-winning performance in ""The Pianist"" and the much lower profile but still rewarding ""Oxygen"" where he plays a character more in keeping with Jack from this story.",4,A dark drama with optimism,1122163200,"07 24, 2005",2005,1641,"['dark', 'drama', 'precipitiously', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'ending', 'brief', 'optimism', 'apparently', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'realized', 'sequel.A', 'crime', 'drama', 'character', 'study', 'love', 'story', 'Love', 'Hard', 'Way', 'unrelentingly', 'interesting', 'involving', 'feast', 'senses', 'incongruous', 'moments', 'are', 'saved', 'searing', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'Columbia', 'University', 'student', 'Claire', 'Charlotte', 'Ayanna', 'Jack', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'amoral', 'leader', 'group', 'confidence', 'men', 'small', 'time', 'crooks.The', 'film', 'romantic', 'unromantic', 'interactions', 'two', 'multi-layered', 'multi-faceted', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'change', 'one', 'change', 'increasingly', 'betrayal', 'everything', 'going', 'who', 'then', 'much', 'worse', 'step', 'story', 'stairacse', 'not', 'credible', 'moment', 'chemistry', 'two', 'very', 'beautiful', 'leads', 'credible', 'up', 'screen', 'big', 'little', 'passion.The', 'story', 'personal', 'interactions', 'characters', 'are', 'aided', 'on-location', 'filming', 'gritty', 'grimy', 'sections', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'photography', 'noirish', 'dark', 'streets', 'half-lit', 'rooms', 'rainy', 'evenings', 'trappings', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'crime', 'drama', '1955', 'good', 'cast', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'two', 'leads', 'interesting', 'modern', 'take', 'film', 'noir.Also', 'look', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'two', 'other', 'fine', 'dramas', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'performance', 'Pianist', 'much', 'lower', 'profile', 'still', 'rewarding', 'Oxygen', 'where', 'character', 'more', 'keeping', 'Jack', 'story']",N/A

Jack (Adrien Brody) is a thief and con artist with a creative m.o. They come from two very different cultures and have disparate personalities. Yet, when they meet, they are immediately attracted to one another. Claire is drawn to Jack's scumminess and becomes infatuated with him. And although Jack tells himself that his attraction to Claire is purely physical, that may not be the whole story. When Claire's intense feelings begin to  make him uncomfortable, Jack dumps her. Claire's devastation sends her on a self-destructive binge, and Jack, who feels responsible, follows suit.&quot;Love the Hard Way&quot; was inspired by a Chinese novel, the production is European, and it was filmed in New York City with a mostly American cast. Although the film has a strong sense of taking place in a certain location among a particular sub-culture, the story is surprisingly universal. An emotionally distant man discovers, the hard way, that love may be what he seeks after all. And a caring but naive woman discovers that her life may be found in the world outside her sheltered environment. The performances in &quot;Love the Hard Way&quot; are all admirable. Adrien Brody fans will want to see this one. He is especially good here. Pam Grier is a welcome addition to the cast in a small role as a police detective. &quot;Love the Hard Way&quot; was shot in just over a month on a relatively small budget. But the film looks great and the attention to detail is commendable. Writer/director Peter Sehr, producer Wolfram Tichy, cinematographer Guy Dufaux, and Christian Nauheimer, the film's editor, have all done an excellent job of pulling off a very good film that looks very good with limited resources. Recommended if you like character dramas or offbeat, somewhat hard-boiled, love stories.The DVD: The bonus features include a &quot;making of&quot; documentary, deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, and a gallery of still photographs.

I saw Brody's work in &quot;Ten Benny&quot; and enjoyed that movie. I haven't seen &quot;The Pianist&quot; and I am reluctant to do so because it has all the trappings of a pseudo intellectual &quot;art house&quot; favorite. You know the kind that generates &quot;buzz&quot; in all the right circles, compelling those who want to be in the in crowd to see it and hurl all the film-scholl inspired adjectives they can muster at it. Before you know it people standing in line at Target who don't know the difference between f-stop and f-troop are hailing it as a moody, intense work of art. Then you go see it and you wonder what the heck all the fuss was about.....&quot;Memento&quot; springs to mind as well.This movie is different. If you go in not expecting much, and having never heard of it, I expected nothing then it's hard to be disappointed. Okay, you may not be able to toss the title or selected quotes from the movie around amongst those you'd like to impress, but who cares? Movies are art, and art is subjective.You've seen countless plot summaries in this forum so I will spare you my interpretation. I think that this is a great little movie. It doesn't aspire to change the world. It offers a glimpse into the underbelly of society, and the people who inhabit it, visit it and police it. I think Adrien Brody is great in this as is Jon Seda. Charlotte Ayanna has been getting a bad rap here but I think those reviewers miss the point of her role. She's playing a young naive, sheltered woman. That may indeed come off as annoying to some but that is her character also. I feel despite her naivete she knows that there is a softer Jack below the surface and will do anything to reach him, even to her own detriment. Hats off to Ms. Ayanna! I think she did wonderfully. Pam Grier is great as the detective out to get Jack and his crew. I loved this movie and can't think of a better way to escape for 104 minutes than to watch this movie.The bonus feature documentary is great too, if a little long. It's also rather amusing to see them refer to this as a &quot;low budget&quot; project in the voice over as you see the massive crew and ridiculous amounts of set-up they are undertaking with each scene. I guess &quot;low budget&quot; is a relative term depending on the depths of one's pockets. This film is wonderfully lit and shot, however. It has a gritty feel that matches the urban setting perfectly. The hip hop soundtrack helps reinforce the &quot;we on the wrong side of the tracks now&quot; vibe...BUY THIS MOVIE!!

773146,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B0000C2IVA,The Jaundiced Eye,"[3, 3]","A complex character study involving two primary characters. Adrian Brody portrays Jack, an intriguingly two-sided figure. One side is literate and sensitive, creating a secret little ""office"" in a tiny, rental cubicle in which he studiously labors on a novel based on his second side: a violent, risk-taking con man who sets up foreign businessmen with hookers, then masquerades as a vice cop to shake them down. To further complicate his life, he meets and becomes infatuated with a brilliant but virginal movie house concession stand clerk named Claire (Charlotte Ayanna). Claire is intrigued by Jack's dangerous side and strongly attracted to his sensitive side, and as a result, falls so deeply in love with him that she is willing to do anything to preserve their increasingly difficult relationship. ""Anything"" in this case includes drugs, prostitution, and other self-destructive behaviors. As is always the case, gentle people such as Claire cannot venture into this realm without paying a huge price, including complete emotional breakdown and fully intended, not simply ""attempted"", suicide. How will it end? Apparently even director Peter Sehr could not completely resolve this issue, but it appears that they settled on a sweet but rather ambiguous and unlikely ""happy ending"".Plot synopsis aside, there is an equally interesting and unbelievable side story involving Charlotte Ayanna, the virginal Claire. Born in Puerto Rico and originally named Lopez (Ayanna, a stage name, means ""blessed), her mother had serious psychiatric problems and as a result, she and her brother and sister were put into foster care and endured an impoverished childhood. Charlotte was in the system for 16 years before being adopted by a family in Vermont. She entered the Miss Teen USA contest, won the title of ""Miss Vermont"" and ultimately was crowned Miss Teen USA in 1993 wearing a $37 evening gown.The movie is extremely ""gritty"" and at times rather depressing, but overall it is definitely worth the viewing time. The DVD deleted scenes include a scene that makes the ending far less ambiguous....be sure to watch.",4,"A Haunting, Complex, Ultimately Rewarding Movie...with a Backstory",1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,2113,"['complex', 'character', 'study', 'involving', 'two', 'primary', 'characters', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'Jack', 'intriguingly', 'two-sided', 'figure', 'One', 'side', 'literate', 'sensitive', 'creating', 'secret', 'little', 'office', 'tiny', 'rental', 'cubicle', 'studiously', 'novel', 'based', 'second', 'side', 'violent', 'risk-taking', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'up', 'foreign', 'businessmen', 'hookers', 'then', 'vice', 'cop', 'shake', 'down', 'further', 'complicate', 'life', 'infatuated', 'brilliant', 'virginal', 'movie', 'house', 'concession', 'stand', 'clerk', 'named', 'Claire', 'Charlotte', 'Ayanna', 'Claire', 'intrigued', 'Jack', 'dangerous', 'side', 'strongly', 'attracted', 'sensitive', 'side', 'result', 'so', 'deeply', 'love', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'preserve', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'relationship', 'Anything', 'case', 'drugs', 'prostitution', 'other', 'self-destructive', 'behaviors', 'always', 'case', 'gentle', 'people', 'such', 'Claire', 'can', 'not', 'venture', 'realm', 'paying', 'huge', 'price', 'including', 'complete', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'fully', 'intended', 'not', 'simply', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'How', 'will', 'end', 'Apparently', 'even', 'director', 'Peter', 'Sehr', 'could', 'not', 'completely', 'resolve', 'issue', 'settled', 'sweet', 'rather', 'ambiguous', 'unlikely', 'happy', 'ending', '.Plot', 'synopsis', 'aside', 'equally', 'interesting', 'unbelievable', 'side', 'story', 'involving', 'Charlotte', 'Ayanna', 'virginal', 'Claire', 'Born', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'originally', 'named', 'Lopez', 'Ayanna', 'stage', 'name', 'blessed', 'mother', 'had', 'serious', 'psychiatric', 'problems', 'result', 'brother', 'sister', 'were', 'put', 'foster', 'care', 'endured', 'impoverished', 'childhood', 'Charlotte', 'was', 'system', '16', 'years', 'being', 'adopted', 'family', 'Vermont', 'entered', 'Miss', 'Teen', 'USA', 'contest', 'won', 'title', 'Miss', 'Vermont', 'ultimately', 'was', 'crowned', 'Miss', 'Teen', 'USA', '1993', 'wearing', '37', 'evening', 'gown.The', 'movie', 'extremely', 'gritty', 'times', 'rather', 'depressing', 'overall', 'definitely', 'worth', 'viewing', 'time', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'include', 'scene', 'ending', 'far', 'less', 'ambiguous', '.be', 'sure', 'watch']",N/A
