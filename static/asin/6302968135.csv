347638,A2LQQKWT4NROUW,6302968135,"1Life ""&#34;Live life with no regrets&#34; ~ ...","[0, 2]","A really good movie... if you're still unsure about this movie, search ""American Me"" and read my review there, i wrote some stuff on this movie there too.I really love this movie alot... I seen it about 30+ times... It's def. one to own.. If you seen ""American Me"", or are into the gangsta films, then see this one...This one focuses on the culture (La Raza), and life in/outside of prison... it follows the path of 3 brothers, 1 as an artist (Cruz), 1 as a cop (Paco), 1 as the prisoner (Miklo). La Raza means a different meaning to Paco and Miklo... Miklo has the wrong meaning... but i'm not going to tell you what it means, cuase then i'd be giving away the movie...Miklo's character is one of the ""downest"" (beaing gangsta) characters i seen in some movies... he's no Snoop Dogg, or Dre, but he's character (not to get into any racial offense here) that looks like a Caucasian on the outside, but like he says in the movie, ""I'm brown on the inside; to the bone."" You can only imagine some of the crap he has to go thru cuase of his mix race... which is similar to William Forsythe's character in ""American Me"".You see alot of culture in this movie... to me, it's kinda sad of how the movie ends... i wish the makers would make a sequel to it.. i think with how it ends, you could make a sequel to it...oh yeah, i'm not going to translate my title up there for you... You'll find out when you watch the movie what it means..If you're looking for a Bloods & Crips movie, this ain't it, nor is ""American Me""... Both movies involve Latino/Chicano gangs/African American gangs such as: BGF (Black Guerilla Family), Vatos Locos, (Pachucos), AbN (Aryan Brotherhood Nation - these are your nazi skinhead prison gangs)...Don't let the cover pic of ""Blood In, Blood Out"" fool you... the red and the blue rag there, cuase there ain't no Bloods & Crips in this one...",4,Dias de los Muertos,1141603200,"03 6, 2006",2006,1861,"['really', 'good', 'movie', ""'re"", 'still', 'unsure', 'movie', 'search', 'American', 'Me', 'read', 'review', 'there', 'i', 'wrote', 'stuff', 'movie', 'there', 'really', 'love', 'movie', 'alot', 'seen', '30+', 'times', 'def', 'one', 'own..', 'seen', 'American', 'Me', 'are', 'gangsta', 'films', 'then', 'see', 'one', 'one', 'culture', 'La', 'Raza', 'life', 'in/outside', 'prison', 'path', '3', 'brothers', '1', 'artist', 'Cruz', '1', 'cop', 'Paco', '1', 'prisoner', 'Miklo', 'La', 'Raza', 'different', 'meaning', 'Paco', 'Miklo', 'Miklo', 'wrong', 'meaning', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'what', 'cuase', 'then', 'i', ""'d"", 'be', 'giving', 'away', 'movie', 'Miklo', 'character', 'one', 'downest', 'beaing', 'gangsta', 'characters', 'i', 'seen', 'movies', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Dre', 'character', 'not', 'get', 'racial', 'offense', 'here', 'Caucasian', 'outside', 'movie', ""'m"", 'brown', 'inside', 'bone', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'crap', 'go', 'thru', 'cuase', 'mix', 'race', 'similar', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'character', 'American', 'Me', '.You', 'see', 'alot', 'culture', 'movie', 'kinda', 'sad', 'how', 'movie', 'i', 'wish', 'makers', 'would', 'make', 'sequel', 'it..', 'i', 'think', 'how', 'could', 'make', 'sequel', 'yeah', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'translate', 'title', 'up', 'there', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'when', 'watch', 'movie', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Bloods', 'Crips', 'movie', 'ai', ""n't"", 'American', 'Me', 'movies', 'involve', 'Latino/Chicano', 'gangs/African', 'American', 'gangs', 'such', 'BGF', 'Black', 'Guerilla', 'Family', 'Vatos', 'Locos', 'Pachucos', 'AbN', 'Aryan', 'Brotherhood', 'Nation', 'are', 'nazi', 'skinhead', 'prison', 'gangs', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'cover', 'pic', 'Blood', 'Blood', 'Out', 'fool', 'red', 'blue', 'rag', 'there', 'cuase', 'there', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Bloods', 'Crips', 'one']",N/A
347639,ADJKMC7AO7YN3,6302968135,Amazon Customer,"[23, 28]","Came across this video a few years back and was excited to see it on DVD.  A definite must buy for those that are interested in Epic's.Coming in at  slightly over 3 hours, &quot;Blood In, Blood Out&quot; revolves around the  2 half brothers and their cousin in the Latino/Chicano culture of East Los  Angeles.  The time frame spans about 15 years as the boys are in their late  teens when the story begin in the early 70's and finishes in the mid  80's.It is a gritty in depth look at how 3 boys from the same family  learned their street smarts and end up taking a different path based on  their decisions.  What is the core theme here is family.  Is blood thick,  or those who claim to be your brothers on the streets.  In a nutshell, one  brother, the epitome of a young gang member witnesses an event that changes  his life for the better hence he joins the military and when he get out  becomes a undercover cop back home.  The second brother, an artist on the  fast track to fame and fortune can't give up his street family lifestyle  and plunges into a world of depression and drugs after a certain event  changes his life.  Finally, Miklo, the cousin who is half-white has always  wanted to fit in, and will do anything...including kill.  When his family  rejects him on the outside, he finds a new life in San Quentin, and it is  not pretty.  The story revolves around this dynamic cast as they learn the  meaning of family crisis, revenge, and forgiveness.The accuracy is dead  on.  The attention to detail of the Hispanic culture through their fashion,  their music, their outlook gives the viewer a great perspective on the  gangs of east L.A.  It is beautifully done.  However, get ready for some  violence, because there is plenty, but it is not done wrecklessly.  It  serves a purpose to move the story forward and you'll see why.The cast  is impressive too.  Their are many cameo surprise appearances, and they  could not have done a better job with makeup.  You really feel for these  characters, even the bad ones because you truly begin to learn their plight  and outlooks.For myself the best scenes were in prison with Miklo.  Very  powerful and very, very scary!  You learn that there are power plays in  prison and the crime doesn't stop once behind bars, as new families and  alliances are forged.  Here we see a gang war inside between the members of  the black, white and Chicano races...and it is not pretty.  There are many  plot twists within this sub-story and a suprise event that will leave your  jaw dropping.  Maybe for some, family in the joint is stronger than your  blood family on the outside.The DVD itself could have been better.  There is no original trailer, or choices for captions other than English.  There is a short 10 minute documentary on the making of the film which is  interesting.  The scene selection is great, you can choose from 33 of them  all in order.  But alas, no bio's or any other extra's, but I think you'll  agree this is a great movie!",5,5 Puntos por Vato Locos - 5 Points for Crazy Brothers.,965174400,"08 2, 2000",2000,3000,"['Came', 'video', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'DVD', 'A', 'definite', 'must', 'buy', 'are', 'interested', ""Epic's.Coming"", 'slightly', '3', 'hours', 'quot', 'Blood', 'Blood', 'Out', 'quot', '2', 'half', 'brothers', 'cousin', 'Latino/Chicano', 'culture', 'East', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'time', 'frame', 'spans', '15', 'years', 'boys', 'are', 'late', 'teens', 'when', 'story', 'begin', 'early', '70', 'finishes', 'mid', ""80's.It"", 'gritty', 'depth', 'look', 'how', '3', 'boys', 'same', 'family', 'learned', 'street', 'smarts', 'end', 'up', 'taking', 'different', 'path', 'based', 'decisions', 'What', 'core', 'theme', 'here', 'family', 'blood', 'thick', 'who', 'claim', 'be', 'brothers', 'streets', 'nutshell', 'one', 'brother', 'epitome', 'young', 'gang', 'member', 'event', 'life', 'better', 'hence', 'military', 'when', 'get', 'out', 'undercover', 'cop', 'back', 'home', 'second', 'brother', 'artist', 'fast', 'track', 'fame', 'fortune', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'street', 'family', 'lifestyle', 'world', 'depression', 'drugs', 'certain', 'event', 'changes', 'life', 'Finally', 'Miklo', 'cousin', 'who', 'half-white', 'always', 'wanted', 'fit', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'including', 'kill', 'When', 'family', 'outside', 'new', 'life', 'San', 'Quentin', 'not', 'pretty', 'story', 'dynamic', 'cast', 'learn', 'meaning', 'family', 'crisis', 'revenge', 'forgiveness.The', 'accuracy', 'dead', 'attention', 'detail', 'Hispanic', 'culture', 'fashion', 'music', 'outlook', 'viewer', 'great', 'perspective', 'gangs', 'east', 'L.A', 'beautifully', 'done', 'However', 'get', 'ready', 'violence', 'plenty', 'not', 'done', 'wrecklessly', 'purpose', 'move', 'story', 'forward', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why.The', 'cast', 'impressive', 'too', 'are', 'many', 'cameo', 'surprise', 'appearances', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'makeup', 'really', 'feel', 'characters', 'even', 'bad', 'ones', 'truly', 'begin', 'learn', 'plight', 'outlooks.For', 'best', 'scenes', 'were', 'prison', 'Miklo', 'Very', 'powerful', 'very', 'very', 'scary', 'learn', 'are', 'power', 'plays', 'prison', 'crime', ""n't"", 'stop', 'once', 'bars', 'new', 'families', 'alliances', 'are', 'forged', 'Here', 'see', 'gang', 'war', 'members', 'black', 'white', 'Chicano', 'races', 'not', 'pretty', 'are', 'many', 'plot', 'twists', 'sub-story', 'suprise', 'event', 'will', 'leave', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'Maybe', 'family', 'joint', 'stronger', 'blood', 'family', 'outside.The', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'original', 'trailer', 'choices', 'captions', 'other', 'English', 'short', '10', 'minute', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'interesting', 'scene', 'selection', 'great', 'can', 'choose', '33', 'order', 'alas', 'bio', 'other', 'extra', 'think', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

347642,A2HL7R8R23NERT,6302968135,Bart King,"[2, 2]","BLOOD IN, BLOOD OUT (a.k.a. ""Bound by Honor"") is a bit of a surprise. While it incorporates many of the predictable elements of a barrio crime film, it is also just different enough to keep you hanging in there. For example, this film has the best location shots of East L.A. I think I've ever seen, and the whole movie has the look of authenticity. This is no illusion; the prison scenes were filmed in San Quentin, and there are only eight actors used for them.This adds interest as you try to spot the ""real"" actors behind bars. (Hint: The convict who looks like Billy Bob Thornton IS Billy Bob Thornton.) Another one of the non-cons is Hispanic poet Jimmy Santiago Baca; he plays the member of La Onda with a heavily pruned mustache. Baca co-wrote this screenplay, and it's clear that he's unaccustomed to the traditional story arcs of mainstream film. That's not to the project's detriment, but it does mean that you have to sit through the first half-hour of the movie before its promise starts to be revealed.In other words, this movie's bad acting and melodramatic music score are at their worst in the early going. Perhaps this is intentional; BLOOD IN, BLOOD OUT means it's hard to get in the gang, and it's not easy bailing from it either; the same is true for the viewer watching this movie. And just like joining a gang, you're making a real commitment here, as the film is well over three hours long.

347663,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,6302968135,LadyLestat,"[2, 3]","I think what seperates this movie from other prison movies is there's a much bigger message to be learned, and it's not just stay away from prison (we all know that by now). However, there's more to it, and this movie shows you that. Don't get me wrong, you still have the same violent, death by shankings, and rioting scenes, but that's just not the primary focus of the whole movie. Let me just say that I am glad that it wasn't as violent and graphic in nature with the rape scenes as it's fellow Chicano prison film.. American Me. American Me was good, but it's so dark throughout. There were no happy moments in that movie from start to finish. Frankly, after watching that I went from calm and cool to sick and depressed. However, with Blood in Blood Out, this was the first time they tried to actually give you a happy ending. This movie is about much more than drugs and prison rape scenes. It's about family, loyalty, coming of age, and finding forgiveness. The man that Paco started out as, is not who he grew up to be, which was inspirational in a way. It just shows that just because your life starts off bad that doesn't always mean that you can't change who you are, and become something more than just a common street thug. This movie shows you that family is family, and no matter what your family does it's never too late to forgive them and start over. However, I do have 2 pet peeves about this movie. First of all, in my opinion, the movie was entirely too long. Secondly, Miklo didn't learn a damn thing. It's sad that even though he lost a limb he never changed his mentality or his ways, and he ultimately ended up the way he started out. There was no growth with his character period. At least the 2 brothers finally grew up, and became the men they were suppose to be. I guess that just goes to show that some people get it, and some people don't.

347672,A2BON03VAFS1SZ,6302968135,Michael Fishman,"[2, 3]","At three hours and ten minutes I think Blood In, Blood Out should have come with a Certificate of Completion to hang next to the DVD player. I don't say that because I thought the movie was bad, but camping out on the couch for half a day (I like bathroom and snack breaks) requires a big commitment.Blood In Blood Out (which seemed like a really corny title until I watched the movie) is the story of three 'carnals' (brothers) growing up in East Los Angeles and, as in Angels with Dirty Faces, the different paths their lives take from their beginnings in a local gang after one fateful night. The movie covers about fifteen years in the lives of the brothers and I don't want to give anything away, so I won't talk about any of the characters, or their paths, other than to say that one of the 'carnals' winds up in prison and it's in these prison scenes where I think the movie really excels.I thought Blood In, Blood Out was a very good movie and I can honestly say that at no time during the 3+ hours did I find myself bored, or the story lagging, and off the top of my head I can't think of another epic movie where that didn't happen. Even during Brian De Palma's Scarface there's a scene where I always start to get a little bored.Blood In Blood Out is a good movie that's well directed and manages to balance the three stories quite well while never once losing the focus of the power of the bonds of honor that binds the three brothers, or other family, together. The three main characters are fully fleshed out and real and regardless of your personal feelings for them, you care about them.I thought Blood In, Blood Out was a fascinating story of a group that I find interesting and will never be a part of, and I truly felt that this movie brought me as close to this culture as I'll probably ever get. Unfortunately, with the good comes some bad and one big problem I had with the movie was the acting. I thought the lead actor (Damian Chapa) was pretty bad and he gave one of the worst performances I've seen outside of a direct-to-video, grade B, zombie movie, in a long time. Why he was cast in the title role is beyond me. Many of the other actors were also guilty of overacting, and since I've seen some of these actors in other roles (Jesse Borrego, Enrique Castillo) where they weren't overacting, maybe that was the way they were directed to act for some reason? Ving Rhames, playing some sort of gang specialist working in the prison was not guilty of overacting, but since he can't act in the first place it's not an issue. It was nice to see Richard Masur in a bit part as well as one of my favorite actors, Danny Trejo. Overall, despite what I thought was some subpar acting, this was a good movie.

It looked like a generic gangster movie without much appeal, but I decided to give it a shot anyway since it was so cheap. I had no idea it would become one of my all-time favorite films. Watching it for the first time was an incredibly epic experience. I found myself completely enamored in the story from the very beginning and my attention did not stray in the entire 3 hour runtime. The film builds and builds into an intense climax that chilled me to the bone.The film tells the saga of the three men you see on the cover. Miklo is a half-white half-hispanic young man who has been struggling with his racial identity his entire life. He moves back to East L.A and gets involved with his two cousins in local gang turf wars. We follow the stories of these three men across the decades as they face struggles and hardships on their journey through life.The film is dense with heavy themes of death, pride, sacrifice and redemption. Not only is it entertaining, but also thought-provoking and deals with very controversial subject matter. You will have a lot to think about in the days after watching this film, and believe me it will stay with you that long.Since this is an Amazon review I won't go into any further detail of the plot or themes of the film. All I can say is that it is a monumental achievement in cinematic story-telling and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Goodfellas or even The Godfather.Also, any chance of a blu-ray release in the near future?

The L.A. barrio is a mixed bag of such things, but also it has a subculture of gang violence and sucking sociological quicksand that can drag down young men into cycles of gangland violence and identity. All this comes together in this film.It is pretty darned good, though so convincing that I actually found it hard to watch. I grew up near enough to the L.A. barrio to catch the nuances and authentic flavor. And I know a little Spanish and could follow a bit of the Spanglish that is interspersed with the English dialogue. Actually I am surprised that this film got so many five stars because I think you really had to have lived around this to appreciate how well done it is. There is actually a lot going on in it in terms of interpersonal relationships and also sociology and values.In some ways I think of films like the Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith and Carlito's Way in terms of examples of ways of how culture can make it difficult to break out of a downward spiral.Let me add that while the making of added feature talks about Chicanos trying to integrate into an Anglo America, this can be somewhat misleading historically. Don't assume that this culture is one of immigrants. These are a conquered people who were here many years before the U.S. conquest of California. They were subject to over a century of efforts to subjugate their communities and this tended to tighten their family and friendship alliances. I tend to see the strong bonds in the L.A. gangs and families as even stronger than in Mexico. These are not simply Mexicans that have immigrated to Los Angeles.The acting is pretty intense. Some might think it overdone if they are not familiar with a certain type of Chicano macho style and value system.All in all, really good. Though I would have thought not for everyone.

The importance of realism cannot be over-emphasized in amovie dealing with this type of subject.At the same time, the work is also another milestone indocumenting gang lifestyles, namely,  its origins and thementalities of those belonging and taking part in it.The acting talent is also spotless, in particular  Benjamin Bratt(as  Paco, a US Marine and later DEA agent), and Jesse Borrego(as Cruz, a graffiti artist, and  painter). To a lesser degree,Damian Chapa  (as Miklo, a gangster) puts in a good effort, whilealso being a bit of an oddball in the casting. His perception isshown, as battling being of mixed-origins, only half-Latinohaving to be twice as extreme to be accepted by his peers in thegang subculture.The movie is educational, showing the uphill struggle of thosedesiring to leave the penal system, once brought into it,considering that the outside world (as well as the inside one) isnot black and white, but different shades of grey, as manypartake in gambling, the bookie business, sex rackets, gangviolence, abuse, physical threats, etc.The script seems well articulated, with a fair bit of slang andjargon from the subculture (""Don't mad dog me!"" or ""Carnal!"" -bro, etc.)The name of the movie, is perhaps a misnomer, as the gang membersare compelled to stand in solidarity with each other, over aperiod of years, from a feeling of identity and common origins,and not necessarily for satisfying a requirement of honor.Indeed, the essence of this movie is about how people change, tosurvive economically, realistically, and socially over a periodof years from youth to well into their adulthood, measuring thatchange against a non-changing gang oath.Particular effort was made into making the scenes stylish andvisually appealing: a Fedora hat, coupled with a white interiorshirt, or a muscle shirt being the gang uniform.The movie has plenty of action, with street chases, wrecklessdriving in streets spectacularly laid out, as well as man-to-mancombats, pistol firefights, and more.The hardships behind bars are not left out, showing the pressuresfelt, gang authority exerted , the outcome of limitated access tohelp, freedom and resources in realizing one's natural potential,or even, access to certain foods and dishes. It also suggestspayoffs occur behind the scenes which can explain a lot.With merit, the story reminds viewers that, if there are sellersof substances, it exists stems from a significant consumer-sidein the USA, meaning, a supply is setup, very profitably, to meetthe demand, with the resulting competition, double-crosses,strategic take-outs of rivals, etc.In sum, this is a long, visual movie, that will captivate theaudience, holds their interest and takes them on an impeccableautobiographical tale from childhood in the barrio to adulthood,with a number of hardships, struggles and successes.",3,A  tale from youth in the barrio to adulthood,1243036800,"05 23, 2009",2009,3541,"['Bound', 'Honor', '1993', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'book', 'director', 'faithfully', 'transposed', 'silverscreen.It', 'valuable', 'DVD', 'rental', 'interested', 'urbanculture', 'USA', 'particularly', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Latinos', 'backin', '1970', 'Considering', 'length', 'film', '3', 'hours', 'visual', 'quality', 'not', 'wide-screen', 'special', 'significance', 'andthis', 'case', 'here', 'showing', 'outstanding', 'talent', 'theselection', 'various', 'scenes', 'LA', 'homes', 'barrios', 'streets', 'more', 'such', 'story', 'flawless', 'inrepresenting', 'places', 'where', 'actual', 'story', 'andforms', 'upto', 'including', 'showing', 'pentitentiary', 'manyaspects', 'importance', 'realism', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'over-emphasized', 'amovie', 'dealing', 'type', 'subject.At', 'same', 'time', 'work', 'also', 'milestone', 'indocumenting', 'gang', 'lifestyles', 'namely', 'origins', 'thementalities', 'belonging', 'taking', 'part', 'it.The', 'acting', 'talent', 'also', 'spotless', 'particular', 'Benjamin', 'Bratt', 'Paco', 'US', 'Marine', 'later', 'DEA', 'agent', 'Jesse', 'Borrego', 'Cruz', 'graffiti', 'artist', 'painter', 'lesser', 'degree', 'Damian', 'Chapa', 'Miklo', 'gangster', 'good', 'effort', 'whilealso', 'being', 'bit', 'oddball', 'casting', 'perception', 'isshown', 'battling', 'being', 'mixed-origins', 'only', 'half-Latinohaving', 'be', 'twice', 'as', 'extreme', 'be', 'accepted', 'peers', 'thegang', 'subculture.The', 'movie', 'educational', 'showing', 'uphill', 'struggle', 'thosedesiring', 'leave', 'penal', 'system', 'once', 'brought', 'considering', 'outside', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'isnot', 'black', 'white', 'different', 'shades', 'grey', 'manypartake', 'gambling', 'bookie', 'business', 'sex', 'rackets', 'gangviolence', 'abuse', 'physical', 'threats', 'etc.The', 'script', 'well', 'articulated', 'fair', 'bit', 'slang', 'andjargon', 'subculture', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mad', 'dog', 'Carnal', '-bro', 'etc', 'name', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'misnomer', 'gang', 'membersare', 'compelled', 'stand', 'solidarity', 'other', 'aperiod', 'years', 'feeling', 'identity', 'common', 'origins', 'not', 'necessarily', 'satisfying', 'requirement', 'honor.Indeed', 'essence', 'movie', 'how', 'people', 'change', 'tosurvive', 'economically', 'realistically', 'socially', 'periodof', 'years', 'youth', 'well', 'adulthood', 'measuring', 'thatchange', 'non-changing', 'gang', 'oath.Particular', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'making', 'scenes', 'stylish', 'andvisually', 'appealing', 'Fedora', 'hat', 'coupled', 'white', 'interiorshirt', 'muscle', 'shirt', 'being', 'gang', 'uniform.The', 'movie', 'plenty', 'action', 'street', 'chases', 'wrecklessdriving', 'streets', 'spectacularly', 'laid', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'man-to-mancombats', 'pistol', 'firefights', 'more.The', 'hardships', 'bars', 'are', 'not', 'left', 'out', 'showing', 'pressuresfelt', 'gang', 'authority', 'exerted', 'outcome', 'limitated', 'access', 'tohelp', 'freedom', 'resources', 'realizing', 'one', 'natural', 'potential', 'even', 'access', 'certain', 'foods', 'dishes', 'also', 'scenes', 'can', 'explain', 'lot.With', 'merit', 'story', 'viewers', 'are', 'sellersof', 'substances', 'significant', 'consumer-sidein', 'USA', 'meaning', 'supply', 'setup', 'very', 'profitably', 'meetthe', 'demand', 'resulting', 'competition', 'double-crosses', 'strategic', 'take-outs', 'rivals', 'etc.In', 'sum', 'long', 'visual', 'movie', 'will', 'captivate', 'theaudience', 'interest', 'impeccableautobiographical', 'tale', 'childhood', 'barrio', 'adulthood', 'number', 'hardships', 'struggles', 'successes']",N/A

To get the full impact of this film you really must see the 3 hr 10 min directors cut. Taylor Hackford brilliantly and accurately brings to life the world of gang existance in east Los Angeles during the 1970s. Shot on location in Los Angeles and also inside the California state prison system, Hackford beautifully creates an exciting backdrop within these locals to tell the story of brotherhood, family, love, betrayal, loss of innocence, and death. Damian Chapa plays a half breed white/Chicano teenager who leaves his fathers home in Los Vegas to move back to Los Angeles to rejoin his boyhood friends. Benjamin Bratt plays his closest friend whom he lives with. They are joined together by blood oath into the neighborhood gang. Some violent and heartbreaking events lead the two in totally different directions. One is sent to prison and begins a stunning acsension to power as chief of a prison gang while the other leaves his life as leader of the gang they both belonged to in the outside world behind and becomes a police detective. Terrible events occure that bring the two of them together once again. One ordering the death of rival gang members within and without prison walls, and the other using the power of the law and their bond of friendship to try and stop the killing. More than half this film is shot within the walls of the prison system, and actual inmates were used as extras, which added a great deal of realism to the film.

There is so many great qualities about Blood In Blood Out, I don't know where to begin. The cinematography is phenomenal, with outstanding use of Los Angeles locales. A good chunk of the movie was also filmed in San Quentin State Prison, and almost all of the men you see in the penitentiary are real-life inmates, giving this film a powerful sense of gritty realism.The plot follows the exploits of two half-brothers and their cousin, Miklo. Miklo is a mixed ethnic heritage. His mother is Chicano, while his father is white. Miklo is a true rubio (a fair-haired, blue-eyed person) who passionately embraces his Chicano roots, but finds that his Anglo features are a disadvantage in the Latino world he seeks to be a part of. I feel that this identity crisis and struggle is one of the stronger elements of the plot. Personally, I can relate to much of what Miklo is going through.The major theme throughout this movie is the issue of identity. Miklo, Cruz, and Paco all face difficult trials and tribulations, which shape their lives and identities. Paco, fighting a horrific back injury and heroin addiction, finds his life calling through his creativity and art work which depicts Chicano life in the barrio. Paco's life takes a 180 and he dedicates his life to serving the Chicano community as a police detective. Miklo, on the other hand, finds his inner-strength as a member of La Onda, a Chicano prison gang.If you love action flicks, this one's for you. There is non-stop action for the full three hours.
