987099,A1RO0NW87KR89G,B000FBFUDQ,Drew,"[14, 17]","The Camp Blood films are hands down the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life. They are pathetically acted, badly directed messes, but are very entertaining if you're into that sort of thing.Camp Blood (1999) tells the tale of two couples and their guide that go into the woods for a weekend of camping and hiking, but are set upon by a person wearing a clown mask that has apparently been haunting the woods for several years now. It was shot on video rather than film on a budget that appears to be of upwards of $200-$300.Camp Blood 2 (2000) It's been a year since Trish survived the massacre and she's now in an insane asylum. One day a sleazy director comes to her saying that he's making a movie about her story and he wants her to be the creative consultant. She agrees and they head off to the woods to shoot the film, only to find out that last year's events are repeating themselves. This film was also shot on video. The only distinction between Camp Blood 1&2 is that in part 2 the actors are even worse.Camp Blood 3: Within The Woods (2005) Some rich TV producer decides to shoot a reality show in the same spot that the infamous murders took place several years ago. The contestants show up and so does the killer clown. This time they shot on film, so it looks a little better than the previous two, but it's arguably even worse. The acting and dialogue is horrible and there are loads of continuity issues. Oh, and there's some insanely ugly woman taking her clothes off too.They're all really awful, the first one being the best of the three. The gore is pretty decent, proving anyone can do convincing looking make-up FX as long as they study the early work of Tom Savini long enough. These movies are best enjoyed with a bowl of popcorn and a bunch of your friends ready to rip them apart.Also recommended for anyone who enjoys the Camp Blood Trilogy: The Dead Next Door, Redneck Zombies, & Beware!

I think 'Camp Blood' is a genuinely good movie! The acting is not terrible, and the blood and death scenes are decent. Of course, the built boyfriend  (Michael Taylor) isn't bad, especially in the scene where he is sleeveless and gets wet, lol. The story is about 2 couples going into the woods to camp, and someone dressed as a clown is stalking, and killing, them. And the ending is really interesting, especially when the killer is revealed. The dialogue is kinda boring, but that's because it seems real. Listen to regular people talk, it can be boring. Also, there are a number of editing mistakes and scene looping that could have easily been avoided. Then, there was the sequel, 'Camp Blood 2'. Not as good as the first one. It's a movie in a movie, and I don't like movies like that. A movie is being filmed in the woods about the killings from the previous movie. As the movie production starts, The Clown starts to kill off the cast. The characters are under-developed, so it was hard for me to make a connection with them. The gore is still good, though. What really saved it for me was the ending! And, the third one is not as good as the second one, as the curse of a trilogy seems to go. In the third one, people are asked to stay in the woods where the first two movies happened, for a reality show. All the people that survive split a large cash prize, but The Clown is back.
