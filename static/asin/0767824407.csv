After my first viewing in January 1995 at the theatre I felt that gary oldman deserved to get an oscar for his performance as Beethoven and the film should have easily received the osacr for best movie.  however, the film was very quietly received by the public at large; on the other hand, it has generated an almost cult following among Beethoven fans. The story is based on the biographical account of Schindler and offers one of sevarl possible versions of beethoven's private life.  Quite apart from any inaccuracies the film is wonderfully shot and one of the final scenes that mixes excerpts of Beethoven's childhood, his father and the first performance of the 9th simphony is amazingf.. Critics complained that the music, performed by Georg Solti - who makes a camei appearnce as the conductor of the 9th, was performed according to 20th centurt standards and instruments, rather than the less evolved varieties of Beethoven's day.  i found that to be completely irrelevant.  The point is that the music written almost 200 years ago played on whatever instrument will osund u equivocally beautiful.  The film is very romantic but never sirupy or oinctuos.  Immortal Beloved is Amadeus ' equal in beauty and effect.  The soundtrack of course speaks for itself.as a side note those familiar with Tolstoy's short story 'The Kreutzer Sonata' will find some familiar material.  The fact that Bernard Rose directed the film version of Anna Karenina only 2 years later -- with a beautiful soundtrack of Rachmaninov, tchaikovsky and other Greats -- does not surprise me and suggests that Mr. Rose has excellent taste in music, literature and loves beauty in general.

17262,AH4SL0YL5AQVU,0767824407,Alric the Red,"[4, 4]","Though this is a work of fiction, it does in fact reveal the genius of Beethoven, through passions and rages of scorching intensity.  Director Bernard Rose in the commentary compares the film's construction to that of ""Citizen Kane,"" in that it begins with a mystery that begs to be solved if the man is to be understood.  In this case, it's a final will bequeathing everything to his ""Immortal Beloved,"" along with an undelivered billet-doux to the unknown woman.  In the course of trying to fulfill the maestro's last wishes, the executor of Beethoven's estate explores the composer's past.  Through flashbacks, Beethoven's dizzying genius and private pain are revealed.  It's true, that there is some license here, but it's respectful of the facts, and tries to stay within the lines while exploring the possibilities.  First, there really was such a final will discovered among his papers.  Also, the custody battle over his nephew is well documented, and transcripts were consulted for some word-for-word re-creation, as Rose discloses in his commentary.  The film takes license in that Rose purports to have solved the mystery, and he makes such a strong case, I'm partially convinced he has.But all of that is merely a means of exploring Beethoven.  A thorough knowledge of his music, which I do not possess, would probably heighten the appreciation of some references to it.  For instance, even in my limited familiarity, I know that the 5th Symphony is about fate knocking at one's door.  The very first scene of the film is of Beethoven's weary, hoary head on a white pillow, surrounded by night.  Lightning strobes in sync with the sudden obtrusion of the 5th.  He succumbs.  It was an artful touch, and there might be others similar to it that I can't catch, lacking as I do the prerequisite knowledge.  The primary point here is that the opening allusion adverted to me from the outset that this would be a meticulously crafted film.  But a previous knowledge of the context of his music is not essential toward appreciating this intelligent film in its own right.  When the credits rolled after I showed it to my companion, who had never given the man any thought whatsoever, she said in the warm afterglow of awe, ""I'll never look at that music the same way.""For the performances by the actors, I'm not sure I'm being hyperbolic in saying that Gary Oldman is as stellar an actor as Beethoven was a composer.  He was downright explosive at times, disdainful others, but somehow always sympathetic.  His performance was nothing short of magnificent.  In one of the documentaries on the disc, Oldman admits that he turned the role down a couple of times, until his agent convinced him it would be the right thing.  Thank heaven!  He was a fierce presence every time he was on the screen, as you'd imagine Beethoven himself must have been when he walked into a room.If you already own the SD DVD, as I did, and you still love this film, I suggest you go ahead and upgrade to the Blu-ray.  There is so much filigree in the location shots and the costumes, it definitely benefited throughout from the hi-def transfer, and made seeing it even more pleasurable.  The artistry of the film is given a more rightful emphasis.As for the special features, there's the aforementioned commentary track; a 30-minute documentary ""Beloved Beethoven"" in which the director and other principals of the film reveal some interesting aspects of Beethoven himself; and the original behind-the-scenes featurette (about seven minutes).  So there was nothing new added for the Blu-ray edition, but in this case, the beauty of the film alone makes it worth the upgrade.__________________________________________________",5,Fiery Passion and Genius,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,3706,"['work', 'fiction', 'fact', 'reveal', 'genius', 'Beethoven', 'passions', 'rages', 'scorching', 'intensity', 'Director', 'Bernard', 'Rose', 'commentary', 'film', 'construction', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'mystery', 'be', 'solved', 'man', 'be', 'understood', 'case', 'final', 'will', 'bequeathing', 'everything', 'Immortal', 'Beloved', 'undelivered', 'billet-doux', 'unknown', 'woman', 'course', 'trying', 'fulfill', 'maestro', 'last', 'wishes', 'executor', 'Beethoven', 'estate', 'composer', 'past', 'flashbacks', 'Beethoven', 'dizzying', 'genius', 'private', 'pain', 'are', 'revealed', 'true', 'license', 'here', 'respectful', 'facts', 'tries', 'stay', 'lines', 'exploring', 'possibilities', 'First', 'really', 'was', 'such', 'final', 'will', 'discovered', 'papers', 'Also', 'custody', 'battle', 'nephew', 'well', 'documented', 'transcripts', 'were', 'consulted', 'word-for-word', 're-creation', 'Rose', 'discloses', 'commentary', 'film', 'license', 'Rose', 'purports', 'have', 'solved', 'mystery', 'strong', 'case', ""'m"", 'partially', 'convinced', 'merely', 'means', 'exploring', 'Beethoven', 'A', 'thorough', 'knowledge', 'music', 'do', 'not', 'possess', 'would', 'probably', 'heighten', 'appreciation', 'references', 'instance', 'even', 'limited', 'familiarity', 'know', '5th', 'Symphony', 'fate', 'knocking', 'one', 'door', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'film', 'Beethoven', 'weary', 'hoary', 'head', 'white', 'pillow', 'surrounded', 'night', 'Lightning', 'strobes', 'sync', 'sudden', 'obtrusion', '5th', 'was', 'artful', 'touch', 'might', 'be', 'others', 'similar', 'ca', ""n't"", 'catch', 'lacking', 'do', 'prerequisite', 'knowledge', 'primary', 'point', 'here', 'opening', 'allusion', 'adverted', 'outset', 'would', 'be', 'meticulously', 'crafted', 'film', 'previous', 'knowledge', 'context', 'music', 'not', 'essential', 'appreciating', 'intelligent', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'When', 'credits', 'rolled', 'showed', 'companion', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'given', 'man', 'thought', 'whatsoever', 'said', 'warm', 'afterglow', 'awe', ""'ll"", 'never', 'look', 'music', 'same', 'way', 'performances', 'actors', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'m"", 'being', 'hyperbolic', 'saying', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'stellar', 'actor', 'Beethoven', 'was', 'composer', 'was', 'downright', 'explosive', 'times', 'disdainful', 'others', 'somehow', 'always', 'sympathetic', 'performance', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'magnificent', 'one', 'documentaries', 'disc', 'Oldman', 'turned', 'role', 'down', 'couple', 'times', 'agent', 'convinced', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'thing', 'Thank', 'heaven', 'was', 'fierce', 'presence', 'time', 'was', 'screen', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'Beethoven', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'walked', 'room.If', 'already', 'own', 'SD', 'DVD', 'did', 'still', 'love', 'film', 'suggest', 'go', 'ahead', 'upgrade', 'Blu-ray', 'so', 'much', 'filigree', 'location', 'shots', 'costumes', 'definitely', 'benefited', 'hi-def', 'transfer', 'made', 'seeing', 'even', 'more', 'pleasurable', 'artistry', 'film', 'given', 'more', 'rightful', 'emphasis.As', 'special', 'features', 'aforementioned', 'commentary', 'track', '30-minute', 'documentary', 'Beloved', 'Beethoven', 'director', 'other', 'principals', 'film', 'reveal', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'Beethoven', 'original', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'seven', 'minutes', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'added', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'case', 'beauty', 'film', 'alone', 'upgrade.__________________________________________________']",N/A

The film opens with speculation arising over a mysterious woman who held Beethoven's heart.  He has died and his estate is being debated.  Who is the rightful heir?

The acting is also a triumph, with Oldman giving his all in a role that was not only physically but emotionally demanding.  He carries such conviction in depicting the man's physical ailment but more importantly his emotional conflictions.

Director and writer Bernard Rose did a tremendous job using music as a co-star for this wonderful movie. While it is true, there were letters found made out to ""Immortal Beloved"" written by Beethoven, many scholars believe the woman Beethoven refers to is not even in this movie, but is another married woman named Antonie von Birkenstock Brentano.  She was married very young to an older man in an arranged marriage. None the less, this is an enthralling movie that goes into many details of Beethoven's adult life until his death. Oldman is excellent in his role, and does a wonderful job portraying a deaf man holding a secret love for his younger brother's wife. While the identity of Beethoven's Immortal Beloved may incorrect in the movie, other aspects of his life are accurately presented by writer/director Rose who thoroughly researched the film's subject prior to writing the screenplay. Among the themes covered is Beethoven's apparent rudeness, explained here as being due to his deafness, his disdain for both his contemporary musicians and aristocracy as well as his initial like of Napolean(until he declared himself Emperor). His struggle to obtain custody of his nephew Karl as well as his trying to get Karl to follow in his footsteps while Karl only wants to be a soldier is a main theme. All of the music in the film, is very aptly matched to each scene. This is noted by several of the actors on the included featurette. The visuals, locations and costumes are beautiful and span the time of Beethoven being a  young man until the time of his death. The film is shot mostly in Prague, a city that pretty much looks like it did 300 years ago. The films is also bright and well lit, so these wonderful scenes can be enjoyed in all their Blu-Ray high definition glory. A wonderful movie for those that enjoy history and music.

17274,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,0767824407,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","After seeing this film, I feel uncertainty. Is what I saw biography or fictionalized biography with considerable literary license? I think it is the latter and thus only a few comments will be made regarding historic and biographical accuracy and I will focus more on the work of art produced by director, writer, producer Bernard Rose.We don't know who the mysterious Immortal Beloved was in the life of Beethoven. Historians identify 5 possibilities, of which three are presented here: Austrian Countess Giulietta Guicciardi; Hungarian Countess Erdody; and Beethoven's German sister-in-law, Johana Reiss.Beethoven's secretary, Anton Felix Schindler, is portrayed as the ever faithful servant who tries to find the mysterious Immortal Beloved since she is the inheritor of Beethoven's musical scores.Countess Guicciardi is an early lover of Beethoven, a woman who discovers his deafness. Countess Erdody is in many ways his soul mate and the woman he should have remained with. Johana Reiss was his bitter rival and he took her son away from her in a nasty custody battle. This child is a major influence on Beethoven. He dedicates his later years to teach nephew Carl, a mediocre talent who feels tortured by the hours of piano practice.The cast of the film is very good with the most convincing performances coming from Marco Hofschneider as nephew Carl; Johanna ter Steege as Johana Reiss; and the wonderful Valeria Golina as Countess Guicciardi. A somewhat overly dramatic performance is given by Jeroen Krabbe as Schindler. After all, we know now that Schindedler's biography of Beethoven was greatly fictionalized. That seems to be the tradition with Beethoven. Gary Oldman is able to play Beethoven under a broad range of conditions but his rages seemed a bit over the top. Rossellini as Countess Erdody is stunning to look at but a bit melodramatic when she shows emotions or flat when she is suppose to be non-emotive.The music by Sir George Solti was good and integrated into the narrative well.Can Beethoven's music be linked to the tragedies in his life? Rose seems to think so and makes a very convincing case when he connects Ode to Joy to Beethoven's abuse from his father and his escape from his father's home. But was Johana the Immortal Beloved? The jury is out and the film portrays coincidences and facts that are not part of the historic record. Thus you must enjoy the film as fictionalized biography but not accept Rose's premise and conclusions at face value.",4,Fictionalized biography and a mystery still unsolved in my mind.,1210377600,"05 10, 2008",2008,2484,"['seeing', 'film', 'feel', 'uncertainty', 'what', 'saw', 'biography', 'fictionalized', 'biography', 'considerable', 'literary', 'license', 'think', 'latter', 'thus', 'only', 'few', 'comments', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'regarding', 'historic', 'biographical', 'accuracy', 'will', 'focus', 'more', 'work', 'art', 'produced', 'director', 'writer', 'producer', 'Bernard', 'Rose.We', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'mysterious', 'Immortal', 'Beloved', 'was', 'life', 'Beethoven', 'Historians', 'identify', '5', 'possibilities', 'three', 'are', 'presented', 'here', 'Austrian', 'Countess', 'Giulietta', 'Guicciardi', 'Hungarian', 'Countess', 'Erdody', 'Beethoven', 'German', 'sister-in-law', 'Johana', 'Reiss.Beethoven', 'secretary', 'Anton', 'Felix', 'Schindler', 'portrayed', 'ever', 'faithful', 'servant', 'who', 'find', 'mysterious', 'Immortal', 'Beloved', 'inheritor', 'Beethoven', 'musical', 'scores.Countess', 'Guicciardi', 'early', 'lover', 'Beethoven', 'woman', 'who', 'deafness', 'Countess', 'Erdody', 'many', 'ways', 'soul', 'mate', 'woman', 'should', 'have', 'remained', 'Johana', 'Reiss', 'was', 'bitter', 'rival', 'took', 'son', 'away', 'nasty', 'custody', 'battle', 'child', 'major', 'influence', 'Beethoven', 'later', 'years', 'teach', 'nephew', 'Carl', 'mediocre', 'talent', 'who', 'tortured', 'hours', 'piano', 'practice.The', 'cast', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'most', 'convincing', 'performances', 'coming', 'Marco', 'Hofschneider', 'nephew', 'Carl', 'Johanna', 'ter', 'Steege', 'Johana', 'Reiss', 'wonderful', 'Valeria', 'Golina', 'Countess', 'Guicciardi', 'A', 'somewhat', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'given', 'Jeroen', 'Krabbe', 'Schindler', 'know', 'now', 'Schindedler', 'biography', 'Beethoven', 'was', 'greatly', 'fictionalized', 'be', 'tradition', 'Beethoven', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'able', 'play', 'Beethoven', 'broad', 'range', 'conditions', 'rages', 'seemed', 'bit', 'top', 'Rossellini', 'Countess', 'Erdody', 'stunning', 'look', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'when', 'emotions', 'flat', 'when', 'suppose', 'be', 'non-emotive.The', 'music', 'Sir', 'George', 'Solti', 'was', 'good', 'integrated', 'narrative', 'well.Can', 'Beethoven', 'music', 'be', 'linked', 'tragedies', 'life', 'Rose', 'think', 'so', 'very', 'convincing', 'case', 'when', 'Ode', 'Joy', 'Beethoven', 'abuse', 'father', 'escape', 'father', 'home', 'was', 'Johana', 'Immortal', 'Beloved', 'jury', 'out', 'film', 'portrays', 'coincidences', 'facts', 'are', 'not', 'part', 'historic', 'record', 'Thus', 'must', 'enjoy', 'film', 'fictionalized', 'biography', 'not', 'Rose', 'premise', 'conclusions', 'face', 'value']",N/A

Gary Oldman opens up the character of Ludwig Von Beethoven as it has never been seen before by the general audience.  I  think that Oldman did a superb job in transforming into the grumpy  musician.  Even though other reviews have stated that his performance was  stereo-typical in reference to the ways other films have portrayed  Beethoven, but I think that Oldman gave it his best shot, and came out very  well in fact.  Critics must remember that Beethoven was an isolated man, in  his own world of music, he would stagger around the room acting strange,  because he heard a note inside his head and couldn't get it out untill he  put it on paper.  He was deaf, and he did get angry very easily, and did  throw chairs out his window, the only reason he did this was because he was  sp frustrated, frustrated that he couldn't express himself the way he  wanted to, but yes Hollywood has had the trend of making him an old grizzly  man, but I guess that is the way some directors view him.",5,Gary Oldman puts on the show,962582400,"07 3, 2000",2000,1086,"['excellent', 'tale', 'romance', 'lost', 'loves', 'man', 'hidden', 'talent', 'talent', 'music', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'up', 'character', 'Ludwig', 'Von', 'Beethoven', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'general', 'audience', 'think', 'Oldman', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'transforming', 'grumpy', 'musician', 'Even', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'stated', 'performance', 'was', 'stereo-typical', 'reference', 'ways', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'portrayed', 'Beethoven', 'think', 'Oldman', 'gave', 'best', 'shot', 'came', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'fact', 'Critics', 'must', 'remember', 'Beethoven', 'was', 'isolated', 'man', 'own', 'world', 'music', 'would', 'stagger', 'room', 'acting', 'strange', 'heard', 'note', 'head', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'put', 'paper', 'was', 'deaf', 'did', 'get', 'angry', 'very', 'easily', 'did', 'throw', 'chairs', 'out', 'window', 'only', 'reason', 'did', 'was', 'was', 'sp', 'frustrated', 'frustrated', 'could', ""n't"", 'express', 'way', 'wanted', 'yes', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'trend', 'making', 'old', 'grizzly', 'man', 'guess', 'way', 'directors', 'view']",N/A

17277,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,0767824407,C. Middleton,"[6, 7]","There is an interesting story about Beethoven concerning his intense concentration and sheer immersion in the music while in the midst of composing. A young man knocked on his door to deliver a message, an important message about a patron wanting to commission his work. The maestro answered the door, and the delivery boy was taken aback, as Beethoven appeared frazzled, dark rings under his eyes with a mad expression. The boy was asked to wait, that he would only be a few moments. Well, the young man waited and waited, hearing the most beautiful music he had ever encountered. Over two hours transpired when the maestro finally came back to the door. ""Herr Beethoven, I have been waiting over two hours to deliver this most urgent message!"" The composer appeared genuinely confused, ""You must be mistaken, for I have only been away a few moments!"" He then snatched the message out of the boy's hands and slammed the door. To my mind, this is a fine example of pure genius at work.Immortal Beloved (1994) upon its theatrical release was panned by the professional critics as over the top; that Gary Oldman overacted and the director's (Bernard Rose) use of too many clich&eacute;s to tell a speculative story about the secret lover to Beethoven. The early nineties was a time where it was fashionable to be negative and critical with just about everything...fashionable cynicism. Having viewed the DVD for the first time since seeing the film (over 12 years ago) in the theatre, there is no doubt that these ""professional critics"" were way off the mark. This is an excellent film that manages to capture the beginnings of the Romantic age in music. Beethoven is right on the cusp between Classical and the Romantic Movements...and the tragedy and heroism which mark the sensibilities that the Romantic Movement stands for is well represented in this moving film.Gary Oldman is one gifted actor and portrayed the mad genius with the realism and intensity it so well deserves.Beethoven's music all alone without knowing anything about the composer will continue to move audiences' until the end of time, however, the tragic fact that the maestro was stone deaf while composing the majority of his music, particularly, Ode to Joy, is absolutely astonishing! It is known that he actually sawed the legs off a grand piano, bringing it to the floor in order to ""feel"" the vibrations clearer.Isabella Rossellini as the countess is absolutely superb and stunning as her eyes convey so much emotion when her character talks about her love, the maestro.There are some beautiful scenes of old Vienna in the film and, well, this would have to be the greatest sound track of all time.This is a wonderful film, a love story about more than likely the greatest romantic in history: Ludwig von Beethoven.",5,The Greatest Romantic...,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,2792,"['interesting', 'story', 'Beethoven', 'concerning', 'intense', 'concentration', 'sheer', 'immersion', 'music', 'midst', 'composing', 'young', 'man', 'knocked', 'door', 'deliver', 'message', 'important', 'message', 'patron', 'wanting', 'commission', 'work', 'maestro', 'answered', 'door', 'delivery', 'boy', 'was', 'taken', 'aback', 'Beethoven', 'appeared', 'frazzled', 'dark', 'rings', 'eyes', 'mad', 'expression', 'boy', 'was', 'asked', 'wait', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'few', 'moments', 'Well', 'young', 'man', 'waited', 'waited', 'hearing', 'most', 'beautiful', 'music', 'had', 'ever', 'encountered', 'two', 'hours', 'transpired', 'when', 'maestro', 'finally', 'came', 'back', 'door', 'Herr', 'Beethoven', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'two', 'hours', 'deliver', 'most', 'urgent', 'message', 'composer', 'appeared', 'genuinely', 'confused', 'must', 'be', 'mistaken', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'away', 'few', 'moments', 'then', 'snatched', 'message', 'boy', 'hands', 'slammed', 'door', 'mind', 'fine', 'example', 'pure', 'genius', 'work.Immortal', 'Beloved', '1994', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'panned', 'professional', 'critics', 'top', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'overacted', 'director', 'Bernard', 'Rose', 'use', 'too', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'tell', 'speculative', 'story', 'secret', 'lover', 'Beethoven', 'early', 'nineties', 'was', 'time', 'where', 'was', 'fashionable', 'be', 'negative', 'critical', 'just', 'everything', 'fashionable', 'cynicism', 'Having', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'seeing', 'film', '12', 'years', 'ago', 'theatre', 'doubt', 'professional', 'critics', 'were', 'way', 'mark', 'excellent', 'film', 'capture', 'beginnings', 'Romantic', 'age', 'music', 'Beethoven', 'right', 'cusp', 'Classical', 'Romantic', 'Movements', 'tragedy', 'heroism', 'sensibilities', 'Romantic', 'Movement', 'stands', 'well', 'represented', 'moving', 'film.Gary', 'Oldman', 'one', 'gifted', 'actor', 'portrayed', 'mad', 'genius', 'realism', 'intensity', 'so', 'well', 'deserves.Beethoven', 'music', 'alone', 'knowing', 'anything', 'composer', 'will', 'continue', 'move', 'audiences', 'end', 'time', 'however', 'tragic', 'fact', 'maestro', 'was', 'stone', 'deaf', 'composing', 'majority', 'music', 'particularly', 'Ode', 'Joy', 'absolutely', 'astonishing', 'known', 'actually', 'sawed', 'legs', 'grand', 'piano', 'bringing', 'floor', 'order', 'feel', 'vibrations', 'clearer.Isabella', 'Rossellini', 'countess', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'stunning', 'eyes', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'emotion', 'when', 'character', 'talks', 'love', 'maestro.There', 'are', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'old', 'Vienna', 'film', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'greatest', 'sound', 'track', 'time.This', 'wonderful', 'film', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'likely', 'greatest', 'romantic', 'history', 'Ludwig', 'von', 'Beethoven']",N/A
17278,AUHG8KSHI529U,0767824407,Craig Matteson,"[24, 30]","While I admire Gary Oldman's acting abilities and some of his achievements in this film, the film itself has so many flaws that it is hard to forgive.  It is vital to note right from the start that the story of this film has almost nothing to do with the life of the actual Ludwig van Beethoven.  Oh, you could point to this or that biographical detail and claim that such an event occurred, but the movie wrenches everything so far out of context in the service of a fictitious romance that even the truths become false.Since this movie is a romance, I think it would have been better if they had made up a name for the name Adrian Leverkuehn for Arnold Schoenberg in Doctor Faustus.  Even this wasn't enough because in later editions Mann had to put in a disclaimer that Schoenberg had actually invented the twelve tone compositional technique and that Leverkuehn is fictional.  We get no such disclaimers in this film and the violence done the actual Beethoven is far greater.  I suppose if they had made up the name of a composer then they couldn't have used the true star of this film, the excerpts of Beethoven's music forming the soundtrack.  The recording of this soundtrack was a pretty good seller back in 1994.The funeral scene is pretty good.  It was a mob and an even bigger event than shown in the film.  I also like the way Beethoven's deafness was shown at times.  However, in the periods shown in the film, his deafness was not as complete as it was later.  His social awkwardness was not as deranged as it is shown in the film.  Since we lack any sense of the social order of Beethoven's time, I suppose the filmmakers felt that the character had to be shocking for our time, hence the storming man in need of medication sadly unavailable in his time.  No, Beethoven was shocking because he simply claimed priority for himself through his art.But the whole premise of the film is foolish.  There is a letter to an ""Immortal Beloved"" whose identity has been sought out since Beethoven's time, but Maynard Solomon made a very good case for Antonie Brentano back in 1972.  And this woman isn't even in this film!  The only reason people debate this issue is because people tend to like unsolved mysteries and romances.  However, there are facts that point to Brentano and away from every other proposed candidate.  And even the phrase ""Immortal Beloved"" might not be anything more than a clumsy man trying to say something romantic rather than something summing up his life's love.While the scene is totally made up, I did find the scene of Oldman leaning close to the piano to play the ""Moonlight Sontata"" a nice effect.  The scene of Beethoven stumbling through the ""Emperor Concerto"" never happened.  Beethoven's hearing was bad enough that he knew better than to play in public by 1811.  The first performer of the work was Friedrich Schneider, a local church organist in Leipzig.  The Vienna premier in February 1812 was Carl Czerny, a Beethoven pupil and later a great piano teacher as well as performer.Anyway, if you enjoy the film, fine.  Just don't mistake ANYTHING in it as pertaining to the life of the real Beethoven.  Especially NOT the identity the movie supposes for the ""Immortal Beloved"".  Suspect every detail in the film because even events which have some connection to history are completely out of context.

Concentrating on those incidents and years in Beethoven's life that seldom receive much discussion, this motion picture pursues the answer to the mystery of the identity of the woman dubbed by Beethoven in a single surviving letter as his ""Immortal Beloved."" Was it a countess, with whom Beethoven seemed to enjoy the most relative contentment in his stormy life? Was it one of the many admirers of his passionate music? Or was it some other woman, perhaps one pre-dating his fame, long since lost to renown and history? It's all only conjecture, of course, we'll never truly know, but in making this film about a quest for enlightenment carried out by a longtime friend after Beethoven's death, we see not only an unusual biography of a great man, but we are reminded that even one of the most legendary figures in all of history was once a young man who lived out many of the same experiences, fears, sadnesses, and hopes, that would be familiar to any of us. We see Beethoven transcend the brutality of his youth and the crushing blow of his increasing deafness to become the man who inspired the image of Beethoven the stern-visaged icon most think of him as being. And yet even his brilliance was no defense against the pain of lost love. Throughout Immortal Beloved Beethoven's wondrous music, perhaps greatest ever written, flies with free range.

Baer,"[6, 6]","One longs for a movie that treats a great artist's life as something other than the ravings of a madman.While the wait carries on, however, IMMORTAL BELOVED is delicious entertainment. The mysterious woman of Ludwig von Beethoven's scrawled final testament turns out to be his sister-in-law, the widow of a brother killed by consumption, and--in the end--the mother of the nephew Beethoven snatched from her. The boy himself was an unfortunate soul who in the end turns out to have been flesh of Ludwig's flesh.If this sounds a bit like supermarket tabloid stuff, well, the difference lies in that Ludwig von Beethoven was no momentary celebrity whose life will flare out after its requisite fifteen minutes of fame. On the contrary, Beethoven was one of the West's and indeed humanity's great artistic geniuses. A conspiracy tale wraps so much more satisfyingly around a life like his. This is especially so when the story is accompanied by the man's own music, played with ominous solemnity the London Symphony Orchestra under Sir George Solti's baton.I somehow missed this film when it was released in 1994. Other things were going on. A Memorial Day weekend spent with the DVD is a pleasure that more than requites the wait. Jeroen Krabb&eacute;'s performance as Friend-of-Ludwig Anton Schindler deserves at least the merit that Gary Oldman as Beethoven and Isabella Rosselini earned for their arguably lesser performances.Krabb&eacute; becomes the film's dramatic center as he vollies between historical personages in an attempt to piece together the contours of Beethoven's loves. His stolid weightiness makes him perfect for such an anchoring role.The filming (Chekoslovakia) is gorgeous and there is, always, the music.IMMORTAL BELOVED turns Beethoven's life and death into a tragedy.

Is it you're body of work? Or is it the way people perceive your body of work? These are the questions I found myself asking while watching IMMORTAL BELOVED. An interesting if flawed motion picture.IMMORTAL BELOVED is the life of 19th Century Composer Ludwig Van Beethoven (Gary Oldman, Leon) as told by his friends, enemies, and his lovers. Days after Beethoven's death his secretary, Anton Schindler, (Jeroen Krabbe, The Fugitive) discovers a letter that leaves everything in his will to an unknown women. She is his Immortal Beloved, and so Schindler goes on a quest to discover just whom this mystery women is.The film can and probably is compared to two far better films, CITIZEN KANE (for it's setup) and AMADEAUS (for it's chronicle of a famous composer) and while I would never put IMMORTAL BELOVED on any list close to those films, it uses the ideas from both films in a compelling manor. As Schindler visits new people the genius of Beethoven is discovered. The Immortal Beloved, like rosebud, merely a mcguffin, an ends to a means of the plot. When you finally discover the answers, you've already kind of guessed it. But it's well worth the ride.There are some really great moments in this film. I loved it when Beethoven plays a piano for the first time. I love has the camera shows us without telling us just how deaf Beethoven is. The pain and anguish telescoped in the music, and yet for a small moment he's happy, it's been so long since he's played and it all comes flooding back. Then everything is dashed. I also loved the thrill of Beethoven's 9th as we see a glimpse of his childhood and then we hear the silence through Beethoven's ears. These scenes are powerful and gripping, very good stuff.Gary Oldman delivers most of the films great moments, himself. He for the most part plays against type. This film calls for him too be very introverted. His performance is kept very much at bay. When he gets a good role, Oldman fills it with so much love, this is a great perfomance.It's the ensemble and some of the special effects that let me down. There are moments in this film that feel forced and fake. Especially early on, the first few people we meet are kind of dull. Especially Valeria Golino's (Rain Man) scenes, I love Golino but her story did very little to move the story along. I would have removed most of it. There is also this scene on a carriage, that uses some of the worst back projection ever. It pulled me out of the moment. It was so bad.But fortunately when Isabella Rossellini shows up, the bulk of the film begins to unfold, that's when the story gets good. That's when director Bernard Rose (Candyman) begins to craft a fascinating mystery.Being that I know very little about Beethoven, I'm not quite sure how much of this film is true. But if it is, wow what an interesting life Mr. Beethoven had. I only know his music and it's nice to see why these songs were written. This is what makes this film really great. Beethoven's music has been reproduced faithfully, and it's never wasted.

17290,A3LEJ7UEJQDQNA,0767824407,Eddy Oquendo,"[5, 14]","As a lover of classical music, I was interested in this movie because of it's subject matter; my favorite composer, Ludwig Van Beethoven. As a film aficionado, I was interested because Gary Oldman, one of my favorite  actors, played the lead. Having never heard anything about the movie, I was  willing to take the risk of buying it based on those two considerations.  That said, here's my review:I would have rated this movie as &quot;two  stars,&quot; if it weren't for the pleasing cinematography, and, of course,  the music. On occasion, the laudable camerawork is marred by bad editing,  and the sublime music is, in my opinion, overused; you begin to wonder if  this film wasn't intended to be a Beethoven music video! Even the casting  of Oldman, which was superb, and his capable portrayal -- he bore an  uncanny resemblance to the young Beethoven -- wasn't enough to make this an  enthusiastically recommendable movie.The film is disjointed, making the  somewhat, banal plot even more tedious. The storyline is based on a totally  speculative theory of who Beethoven's &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; really  was -- the maestro had, in fact, addressed such a person in a letter --  and, in the process, attempts to paint a picture of the famous composer. We  can never really know what Ludwig was actually like, but many of the  liberties taken in portraying his life are purely fictional; I take little  issue with this, considering that this is a movie, not a  documentary.Beethoven is portrayed as a surly and bitter man -- no doubt  he was, from time to time -- and we are, somehow, expected to pity and like  him nonetheless, due to the circumstances of the movie; that attempt falls  far short of the mark, if anything, we ask ourselves why anyone in the film  likes him at all! In the end, we are left with the idea that we should  honor and love this person based on the power and depth of his music alone,  like the characters in the movie; a ridiculous demand on our  sensibilities.The most moving segment in this film is the Ninth Symphony  performance, where we are allowed to &quot;see&quot; into the mind of the  composer; for me, it justified the purchase of the video.Being  knowledgeable about, and interested in, Beethoven, I can overlook the  inadequacies of this movie, but I would not recommend it to a person with  little interest in the man and his work. If you feel the way that I do  about Ludwig, buy it, if not, you'll likely be disappointed.A far better  film, in this genre, in every respect except the music -- Mozart's music is  equally fabulous -- is &quot;Amadeus.&quot;",3,"Great subject, great music, so-so movie.",942364800,"11 12, 1999",1999,2609,"['lover', 'classical', 'music', 'was', 'interested', 'movie', 'subject', 'matter', 'favorite', 'composer', 'Ludwig', 'Van', 'Beethoven', 'film', 'aficionado', 'was', 'interested', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'played', 'lead', 'Having', 'never', 'heard', 'anything', 'movie', 'was', 'willing', 'take', 'risk', 'buying', 'based', 'two', 'considerations', 'said', 'here', 'review', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'movie', 'quot', 'two', 'stars', 'quot', 'were', ""n't"", 'pleasing', 'cinematography', 'course', 'music', 'occasion', 'laudable', 'camerawork', 'marred', 'bad', 'editing', 'sublime', 'music', 'opinion', 'overused', 'begin', 'wonder', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'intended', 'be', 'Beethoven', 'music', 'video', 'Even', 'casting', 'Oldman', 'was', 'superb', 'capable', 'portrayal', 'bore', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'young', 'Beethoven', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'make', 'enthusiastically', 'recommendable', 'movie.The', 'film', 'disjointed', 'making', 'somewhat', 'banal', 'plot', 'even', 'more', 'tedious', 'storyline', 'based', 'totally', 'speculative', 'theory', 'who', 'Beethoven', 'quot', 'Immortal', 'Beloved', 'quot', 'really', 'was', 'maestro', 'had', 'fact', 'addressed', 'person', 'letter', 'process', 'attempts', 'paint', 'picture', 'famous', 'composer', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'Ludwig', 'was', 'actually', 'like', 'many', 'liberties', 'taken', 'portraying', 'life', 'are', 'purely', 'fictional', 'take', 'little', 'issue', 'considering', 'movie', 'not', 'documentary.Beethoven', 'portrayed', 'surly', 'bitter', 'man', 'doubt', 'was', 'time', 'time', 'are', 'somehow', 'expected', 'pity', 'nonetheless', 'due', 'circumstances', 'movie', 'attempt', 'far', 'short', 'mark', 'anything', 'ask', 'why', 'anyone', 'film', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'idea', 'should', 'honor', 'love', 'person', 'based', 'power', 'depth', 'music', 'alone', 'characters', 'movie', 'ridiculous', 'demand', 'sensibilities.The', 'most', 'moving', 'segment', 'film', 'Ninth', 'Symphony', 'performance', 'where', 'are', 'allowed', 'quot', 'see', 'quot', 'mind', 'composer', 'justified', 'purchase', 'video.Being', 'knowledgeable', 'interested', 'Beethoven', 'can', 'overlook', 'inadequacies', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'person', 'little', 'interest', 'man', 'work', 'feel', 'way', 'do', 'Ludwig', 'buy', 'not', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed.A', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'genre', 'respect', 'music', 'Mozart', 'music', 'equally', 'fabulous', 'quot', 'Amadeus.', 'quot']",N/A

17298,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,0767824407,Godly Gadfly,"[0, 0]","Lovers of classical music and of mystery are going to love this one.  The ""immortal beloved"" mystery has baffled Beethoven scholars since his death.  Beethoven lived his life alone, but among the correspondence discovered after his death is a letter to an unknown ""immortal beloved."" There is still no agreement about the identify of this unnamed personage to whom Beethoven wrote ""I can only live completely with you or not at all"".  But it is the enigma behind this letter that forms the basis for the movie, and the story-line offers one solution to the mystery.The story begins with Beethoven's death in 1827, when his personal secretary Anton Schindler discovers the mysterious letter, and undertakes a mission to uncover the identify of Beethoven's secret love, and so fulfil his dying wish and give her what was rightfully hers.  As he proceeds with his investigation, viewers are treated to a series of flashbacks which take us back to moments in Beethoven's life, and the three women who knew him best.At this point the mystery becomes an excuse to go beyond the public Beethoven into the private Beethoven, his more difficult side.  With Gary Oldman contributing a remarkable performance as the eccentric Beethoven, we are shown how in reality Beethoven was a difficult problematic human being, and we receive a window into his struggle with deafness.  The other characters all play inferior roles and their acting is not outstanding, but Oldman more than makes up for that.  This part of the movie is brilliantly done, and there is a real sense of the frustration caused by his deafness.In the end, the ""immortal beloved"" mystery is ""solved"".  The producer offers a very unlikely solution, but a creative and satisfying one.  But ultimately the mystery falls to the background and the man and his music receive center stage.  This movie may not be a lasting contribution to Beethoven scholarship, but it certainly is a contribution to an appreciation of his music.  The soundtrack, naturally, is pure Beethoven.  And not shoddy performances or recordings either - we are treated to the London Symphony Orchestra, and soloists such as Murray Perahia and Yo-Yo Ma.  But it's not a normal soundtrack where the music was composed to fit the picture.  Here the reverse is true: the picture was composed to fit the music.  As a result, scenes are wonderfully choreographed to the music, with scenes of romance, anger and war perfectly matched to Beethoven's mood music.  By placing his music in the context of a life, even if that life is partly fictional, Beethoven's music has even more power and passion.It's a real treat for lovers of Beethoven's music, for not only is the music brilliantly played and meshed with the plot, but there are some delightful philosophical observations about the power of music.  At one point Beethoven observes: ""It is the power of music to carry one directly into the mental state of the composer.  The listener has no choice.  It is like hypnotism.""  He then challenges the listener: ""What was I thinking when I wrote that?"" Of course every individual will imagine their own picture, but he gives the example describing a man trying to reach his lover, his carriage wheels bogged in the mud ""This is the sound of his agitation.""  The idea is brilliant, and even if listeners today may have vastly different interpretations of what the composer was thinking, their listening experience is enriched by the idea.Be aware that the movie contains several adult themes, including a scene involving brief nudity, violent child abuse, the suggestion of rape, a fist fight, contemplation of suicide, and a war scene.  The suggestion of immorality, however, is not endorsed, because viewers are not encouraged to become like Beethoven, but merely to understand him.  In the end, it's a good marriage of mystery, the man, and music.  It's not all outstanding and the love story is somewhat overdone and implausible, but the rest of the movie makes it worthwhile.  The mystery has a good twist in the end, and the portrayal of Beethoven the man is unforgettable.  And even if even if you disagree with what ""Immortal Beloved"" says about the man, you can't argue with the passion of the music is portrays.  Discard the historical inaccuracies, and just enjoy it for the music and its passion.  Along with Oldman, the real star of this movie is the music itself.",4,"Marriage of the man, the music, the mystery.",1041897600,"01 7, 2003",2003,4389,"['Lovers', 'classical', 'music', 'mystery', 'are', 'going', 'love', 'one', 'immortal', 'beloved', 'mystery', 'baffled', 'Beethoven', 'scholars', 'death', 'Beethoven', 'lived', 'life', 'alone', 'correspondence', 'discovered', 'death', 'letter', 'unknown', 'immortal', 'beloved', 'still', 'agreement', 'identify', 'unnamed', 'personage', 'whom', 'Beethoven', 'wrote', 'can', 'only', 'live', 'completely', 'not', 'enigma', 'letter', 'basis', 'movie', 'story-line', 'offers', 'one', 'solution', 'mystery.The', 'story', 'Beethoven', 'death', '1827', 'when', 'personal', 'secretary', 'Anton', 'Schindler', 'mysterious', 'letter', 'mission', 'uncover', 'identify', 'Beethoven', 'secret', 'love', 'so', 'fulfil', 'dying', 'wish', 'give', 'what', 'was', 'rightfully', 'hers', 'investigation', 'viewers', 'are', 'treated', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'take', 'back', 'moments', 'Beethoven', 'life', 'three', 'women', 'who', 'knew', 'best.At', 'point', 'mystery', 'excuse', 'go', 'public', 'Beethoven', 'private', 'Beethoven', 'more', 'difficult', 'side', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'contributing', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'eccentric', 'Beethoven', 'are', 'shown', 'how', 'reality', 'Beethoven', 'was', 'difficult', 'problematic', 'human', 'being', 'receive', 'window', 'struggle', 'deafness', 'other', 'characters', 'play', 'inferior', 'roles', 'acting', 'not', 'outstanding', 'Oldman', 'more', 'up', 'part', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'real', 'sense', 'frustration', 'caused', 'deafness.In', 'end', 'immortal', 'beloved', 'mystery', 'solved', 'producer', 'very', 'unlikely', 'solution', 'creative', 'satisfying', 'one', 'ultimately', 'mystery', 'background', 'man', 'music', 'receive', 'center', 'stage', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'lasting', 'contribution', 'Beethoven', 'scholarship', 'certainly', 'contribution', 'appreciation', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'naturally', 'pure', 'Beethoven', 'not', 'shoddy', 'performances', 'recordings', 'are', 'treated', 'London', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'soloists', 'such', 'Murray', 'Perahia', 'Yo-Yo', 'Ma', 'not', 'normal', 'soundtrack', 'where', 'music', 'was', 'composed', 'fit', 'picture', 'Here', 'reverse', 'true', 'picture', 'was', 'composed', 'fit', 'music', 'result', 'scenes', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'choreographed', 'music', 'scenes', 'romance', 'anger', 'war', 'perfectly', 'matched', 'Beethoven', 'mood', 'music', 'placing', 'music', 'context', 'life', 'even', 'life', 'partly', 'fictional', 'Beethoven', 'music', 'even', 'more', 'power', 'passion.It', 'real', 'treat', 'lovers', 'Beethoven', 'music', 'not', 'only', 'music', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'meshed', 'plot', 'are', 'delightful', 'philosophical', 'observations', 'power', 'music', 'one', 'point', 'Beethoven', 'power', 'music', 'carry', 'one', 'directly', 'mental', 'state', 'composer', 'listener', 'choice', 'hypnotism', 'then', 'listener', 'What', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'wrote', 'course', 'individual', 'will', 'imagine', 'own', 'picture', 'example', 'describing', 'man', 'trying', 'reach', 'lover', 'carriage', 'wheels', 'bogged', 'mud', 'sound', 'agitation', 'idea', 'brilliant', 'even', 'listeners', 'today', 'may', 'have', 'vastly', 'different', 'interpretations', 'what', 'composer', 'was', 'thinking', 'listening', 'experience', 'enriched', 'idea.Be', 'aware', 'movie', 'several', 'adult', 'themes', 'including', 'scene', 'involving', 'brief', 'nudity', 'violent', 'child', 'abuse', 'suggestion', 'rape', 'fist', 'fight', 'contemplation', 'suicide', 'war', 'scene', 'suggestion', 'immorality', 'however', 'not', 'endorsed', 'viewers', 'are', 'not', 'encouraged', 'become', 'Beethoven', 'merely', 'understand', 'end', 'good', 'marriage', 'mystery', 'man', 'music', 'not', 'outstanding', 'love', 'story', 'somewhat', 'overdone', 'implausible', 'rest', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'mystery', 'good', 'twist', 'end', 'portrayal', 'Beethoven', 'man', 'unforgettable', 'even', 'even', 'disagree', 'what', 'Immortal', 'Beloved', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'argue', 'passion', 'music', 'portrays', 'Discard', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'just', 'enjoy', 'music', 'passion', 'Oldman', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'music']",N/A

I've been a devout Beethoven junkie since I was 14, but nothing of Beethoven's character as portrayed by Oldman rings true to the biographies and many articles I've read about him over the years. (No fault of Oldman's; he didn't write the script.)Early on, we see Beethoven frolicking about in the lusty pursuit of a young girl, when in fact he was somewhat of a prude. He viewed Mozart's Don Giovanni and Marriage of Figaro as immoral, and wrote only one opera himself, Fidelio, because it was the only libretto he thought lived up to his ethical standards.I've long thought that, given a good script, the best actor to play Beethoven would be Harvey Keitel. Just look at that scene on the beach in ""The Piano"" as he listens to Holly Hunter play: His hands clasped behind his back as he paces, head bent forward. He's the spitting image of Beethoven in a famous illustration made in his lifetime.I do recommend a wonderful film on DVD from the BBC, ""Eroica,"" about the premiere rehearsal of that symphony. There's a little thwarted romance subplot, but it's mostly about the drama of the music, conducted by John Eliot Gardiner on period instruments. Ian Hart plays Beethoven.

Such devotion, I believe, was motived by the creators' love of Beethoven and his music. Indeed, it is hard not to love Beethoven's music.I have read many books about Beethoven. But movies can do what books cannot. Movies can fill the imagination with visualization and delight the ear with music to feel the soul of the character. The ""Immortal Beloved"" allowed me to understand Beethoven as no other medium could.Beethoven, in my humble opinion, was the greatest classical composer. There might have been better technicians with finer sense of musical nuances. Bach and Mozart comes to mind when describing musical geniuses. But neither Bach nor Mozart, however, had to overcome the kinds of tremendous obstacles that Beethoven had to overcome to become the finest composer of his day. Unlike Mozart who had a very supportive and a very finest of music teacher as a father, Beethoven grew up in an unloving family with a drunken father who beat him on a regular basis. And he often took the beating in lieu of of his younger sibling whom Beethoven had to support in the midst of a poverty. Impressively, he rose to become the greatest pianist and composer of his generation. Beethoven's greatest creation and inspiration, the 9th Symphony, was written after he had become completely deaf. Yet the 9th Symphony was not about bitter hopelessness brought on by life's tragedies. Out of all his works, it was the 9th Symphony that expressed the awesome joy of life. It was about hope, inspiration, and triumphing over all obstacles with an indomitable spirit and determination. Beethoven's motto must have been ""if determination great, no obstacle can be great"". And I admire him greatly.The only negative aspect of this movie is its rather speculative conclusion of whom the ""immortal beloved"" was. I won't give it away, but the movie's conclusion differs from the conclusion of most experts on Beethoven. The movie's emphasis on the Beethoven's ""immortal beloved"" detracted the movie from the truly immortal Beethoven.",5,Much underrated; Must see if you love Beethoven,1234828800,"02 17, 2009",2009,2402,"['movie', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'commercial', 'flop', 'made', 'only', '9.8m', 'Amadeus', 'one', 'greatest', 'classical', 'music', 'related', 'movies', 'time.Certainly', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'movie', 'good', 'related', 'Beethoven.It', 'very', 'obvious', 'creators', 'lovingly', 'devoted', 'much', 'effort', 'time', 'crafting', 'highly', 'coherent', 'interwoven', 'biography', 'one', 'music', 'greats', 'Such', 'devotion', 'believe', 'was', 'motived', 'creators', 'love', 'Beethoven', 'music', 'Indeed', 'hard', 'not', 'love', 'Beethoven', 'music.I', 'have', 'read', 'many', 'books', 'Beethoven', 'movies', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'books', 'can', 'not', 'Movies', 'can', 'fill', 'imagination', 'visualization', 'delight', 'ear', 'music', 'feel', 'soul', 'character', 'Immortal', 'Beloved', 'allowed', 'understand', 'Beethoven', 'other', 'medium', 'could.Beethoven', 'humble', 'opinion', 'was', 'greatest', 'classical', 'composer', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'technicians', 'finer', 'sense', 'musical', 'nuances', 'Bach', 'Mozart', 'mind', 'when', 'describing', 'musical', 'geniuses', 'Bach', 'Mozart', 'however', 'had', 'overcome', 'kinds', 'tremendous', 'obstacles', 'Beethoven', 'had', 'overcome', 'become', 'finest', 'composer', 'day', 'Mozart', 'who', 'had', 'very', 'supportive', 'very', 'finest', 'music', 'teacher', 'father', 'Beethoven', 'grew', 'up', 'unloving', 'family', 'drunken', 'father', 'who', 'beat', 'regular', 'basis', 'often', 'took', 'beating', 'lieu', 'younger', 'sibling', 'whom', 'Beethoven', 'had', 'support', 'midst', 'poverty', 'Impressively', 'rose', 'become', 'greatest', 'pianist', 'composer', 'generation', 'Beethoven', 'greatest', 'creation', 'inspiration', '9th', 'Symphony', 'was', 'written', 'had', 'become', 'completely', 'deaf', '9th', 'Symphony', 'was', 'not', 'bitter', 'hopelessness', 'brought', 'life', 'tragedies', 'works', 'was', '9th', 'Symphony', 'expressed', 'awesome', 'joy', 'life', 'was', 'hope', 'inspiration', 'triumphing', 'obstacles', 'indomitable', 'spirit', 'determination', 'Beethoven', 'motto', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'determination', 'great', 'obstacle', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'admire', 'only', 'negative', 'aspect', 'movie', 'rather', 'speculative', 'conclusion', 'whom', 'immortal', 'beloved', 'was', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'movie', 'conclusion', 'differs', 'conclusion', 'most', 'experts', 'Beethoven', 'movie', 'emphasis', 'Beethoven', 'immortal', 'beloved', 'detracted', 'movie', 'truly', 'immortal', 'Beethoven']",N/A

However, having said that, it was still very, very good.  Gary Oldman is riveting as the tortured, frustrated composer, who as the movie says: how can he let the public know that he is losing the one sense which should be developed more than any other?  The ""Moonlight Sonata"" scene, when Beethoven is playing in solitude with his ear pressed against the top of the piano is both haunting and heart-wrenching.I disagree with the claims of madness, but I do believe that Beethoven's frustration at his hearing loss affected everything he did--his music, his solitide, and his relationships.  Gary Oldman plays him to perfection.  It is amazing the way he morphs into this embittered man who always seems to be a few intellectual and musical beats ahead of everyone around him, yet still leaves an emotional wall up for others to scale.I highly recommend IMMORTAL BELOVED, if only to watch Gary Oldman portray the man.A word of warning--one of the interviews in the Special Features reveals who the ""Immortal Beloved"" is, I watched them first unknowingly and spoiled the surprise.And to enhance your ""Beethoven Experience,"" I highly recommend finding a copy of the book THE STORY OF BEETHOVEN by Helen L.

This film uses somewhat the same technique used in &quot;Amadeus&quot;; that is, it is told entirely in flashback and the composer (in this case, Beethoven) provides the basis for the plot. Again as in the other film, the composer's music also plays an important role. The director chose to use different pieces to illustrate the action, and it comes out quite beautifully.The plot is intriguing as well. At the beginning, Beethoven dies and leaves a mysterious letter to his &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot;. His last will states that all of his music and property shall go to this woman. His friend and former secretary, Schindler, takes it upon himself to interview three women who were most involved romantically with Beethoven to try and determine which of them is the unknown Beloved.The film is based partly on fact. The ending, of course, is based on speculation. I liked the way they handled Beethoven's character. They made several points throughout showing how his deafness could have affected him.

This, I think, sums up my opinion about this film: it is more pornography than art, more about the director's vision than about Beethoven, who did indeed have an ""immortal beloved"".It's not just the porn that defeats this movie. The history portrayed in this film is nonsense. Virtually nothing is correct. Gary Oldham is an actor with little range whose career has been constructed around a number of poor, cheesy films, of which this is one. He was a terrible choice to play Beethoven, who was 5-foot 5-inches tall, had a fiery, miserable disposition, and was a misanthrope. Oldham, who is 6-feet tall, played the Titan like he was Franz Lizst, a playboy from 1850. For the record, by 1850 Beethoven had been dead 23 years!There is one scene in this film, at the end, where Oldham -- playing the young Beethoven -- falls in a pond and the camera scans upward toward the heavens as Beethoven's ""Emperor"" concerto is being played. This is the one fulfilling moment in this otherwise incredibly poor film. I remember the production values being fine, so it deserves a star for that.I heard a lot of complaining about Ken Russell's movie about Tchaikovsky, ""The Music Lovers"", but at least there Russell got the music right and included it in the movie with scintillating scenes of the 1st Piano Concerto and Swan Lake ballet.

Written and directed by Bernard Rose (CANDYMAN), the movie uses the basic facts of Beethoven's life as the foundation of a dramatic fantasia in which the viewer is constantly overwhelmed by the sumptuous visual design. Rose's episodic screenplay relays events in flashback, as Beethoven - played by Oldman as a multilayered character, rendered increasingly bitter by encroaching deafness - is transformed by the three women who dominated his life (portrayed with dignified candor by Isabella Rosselini, Valeria Golino and Johanna ter Steege). There's also a brief digression into the tragic circumstances surrounding Beethoven's nephew (Marco Hofschneider), who was driven to an act of extreme rebellion by the composer's overreaching ambitions.The period is vividly realized via sumptuous production design (by Jir&iacute; Hlup) and expansive scope photography (by Peter Suschitzky), and Beethoven's glorious music is arranged with exquisite grace by Georg Solti, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra. Standout episodes include the moment when Beethoven first plays the 'Moonlight Sonata', and the breathtaking 'Ode to Joy' sequence, framed against the backdrop of an unhappy memory from Beethoven's youth, which culminates in a moment of supreme cinematic glory, one of the most beautiful images ever filmed.NB. Beethoven scholars have quibbled over the film's attempts to nail the identity of the composer's 'immortal beloved', though the disc makes it clear that Rose's conclusions amount to an educated guess, based on all available evidence at the time of production.

You never saw it that way until they showed you."" in relationship to music of this kind, I dare say that it was just short of true magic. That kind of music held an almost voodoo like power when herd. As I watched the reaction of some of the women in the movie reacting to this kind of music, I could get closer to the type of power, the godlike persuasion, if you will, that some composers had at the time. Have you ever see the old National geographic videos? that showed the reaction of native peoples to orchestral music? It was of great awe - god like and powerfully magical. And please don't remind me the upper crust society was used to it. Not by a long shot. This movie, lets you experience that quality. Yes, you can indulge over the point that the women in the movie ""loved"" the composer, But it is apparent, to some that they are in love with the sound that his music provided. The power of that music, if you had never herd that kind of music very much might very well let you interpret a deep awe.Having seen Immortal Beloved, I have a much stronger respect for Beethoven, as well as his contribution to this world...his music.In My Never To Be Humble personal opinion...a masterpiece. It affects me to such a degree every time I experience it, I always aware of a deep energy penetrating emotion on my face. How would you feel if someone opened your mind to something in an entirely new light? You never saw it that way until they showed you. This is what the film does for me. Rich cinematography, Some untouched primal awe was awakened in me as if we could hear that music the way they would have herd it back in Beethoven's day. A tragic love story in the best sense.I personally feel these people are just missing out on a great film and great storytelling at its best. But you be the judge...see Immortal Beloved.

The film opens with Beethoven'sfuneral in March 29, 1827.  His assistant and friend Anton Felix Schindler (Jeroen Krabbe) isattempting to settle Beethoven's affairs, his Last Will and Testament.  He holds a letter addressedonly to an Immortal Beloved, with it he sets out to find this mysterious woman who is to be thesole heir to Beethoven's fortune.The film tells of three women whom Beethoven was involved with, the first being GiuliettaGuicciardi (Valeria Golino) whom he schooled in piano for a short time and was engaged to bemarried to.  Their relationship ended after her father's intrusion caused an act of betrayal.  Thesecond was Johanna Reiss (Johanna Ter Steege) Beethoven's immortal beloved.  They met whenthey were younger while she was involved with his brother Caspar.  One night Johanna was tomeet Beethoven at a hotel, he was to arrive much later than expected so he sent a letter to herinforming her of this and of his tremendous love for her.  She never received the letter and left thehotel, heartbroken and lonely.  Upon his arrival and discovery of her absence Beethoven went intoa rage.  This terrible miscommunication caused Johanna to marry his brother Caspar and have ason, Karl Van Beethoven whom was actually Ludwig's son.  Johanna and Beethoven were bothaware of this.  Beethoven's life began to decline after the dissolution of their relationship.  Hesought to harm Johanna and after the death of his brother he was eventually successful inobtaining guardianship of their son in a corrupt court.  Beethoven ceased composing and wasdetermined in transforming Karl into a virtuoso.  His son grew to hate him.Schindler discovers through Beethoven's third lover, Anna Marie Erdody (IsabellaRossellini) that Johanna is Beethoven's immortal beloved.  It is from this point that the finest partof the film begins.  Johanna's realization and reading of Beethoven's letter and the memories ofhim are superbly portrayed in this final piece of the story.  It is clear the many women that were inawe of this enigmatic man were in love with his incredible passion.The production values are excellent in particular the music (of course), costumes anddirection.  It was filmed in the Czech Republic and the many great shots show the country'sbeauty.  One particularly extraordinary shot displays Beethoven sitting on the hotel bed lookingout a storm-filled window he had smashed in a rage just moments before.  This shot is completelyGothic in style and it suggests the passion he held in his heart for Johanna.  Another amazingscene shows Beethoven at what is to be his final performance of his ""Symphony number nine-Odeto Joy"".  He is thinking of his childhood and his abusive father's drunken rages at him.  YoungBeethoven would escape through his bedroom window onto the roof and run through themoon-lit countryside to a pond where he would set himself afloat and disappear into the starrynight.  The end of the scene is shown from an aerial view and eventually looks as though he isfloating in space amongst a gigantic sea of stars.  This is extremely illustrative in showing howBeethoven escaped (both physically and mentally) the painful childhood he experienced due to hismaniacal father who often thrashed him so hard that it caused his hearing to deteriorate and wouldeventually lead to his permanent deafness later in his life.  When Johanna begins to readBeethoven's  letter to her it is shown from outside a window.  Schindler is outside and the cameramoves forward stopping just outside the window, we see Johanna crying as Beethoven's voice isheard reciting the letter.  This shot is excellent in its depiction of Johanna's sadness.The costumes are wonderful, in particular the beautifully colored dresses and gowns thewomen are adorned in.  Beethoven's music is heard almost continuously throughout the film andit compliments the scenes extremely well without diluting the narrative.Overall, Immortal Beloved is a stunning piece of work.  Rose's moments of directorialbrilliance and very solid characterization (you felt their pain, particularly Johanna's) are effectivein communicating to the viewer the disparity (due to the social statuses) and sadness, the mysteryand romance and most of all the passion that seemed to thrive in the hearts of so many peopleduring the Romantic period.",4,Immortal Memory,1077148800,"02 19, 2004",2004,4480,"['Immortal', 'BelovedBernard', 'Rose', 'film', 'Immortal', 'Beloved', 'tumultuous', 'life', 'musical', 'geniusLudwig', 'Van', 'Beethoven', 'so', 'quite', 'beautifully', 'film', ""Beethoven'sfuneral"", 'March', '29', '1827', 'assistant', 'friend', 'Anton', 'Felix', 'Schindler', 'Jeroen', 'Krabbe', 'isattempting', 'settle', 'Beethoven', 'affairs', 'Last', 'Will', 'Testament', 'letter', 'addressedonly', 'Immortal', 'Beloved', 'out', 'find', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'thesole', 'heir', 'Beethoven', 'fortune.The', 'film', 'tells', 'three', 'women', 'whom', 'Beethoven', 'was', 'involved', 'first', 'being', 'GiuliettaGuicciardi', 'Valeria', 'Golino', 'whom', 'schooled', 'piano', 'short', 'time', 'was', 'engaged', 'bemarried', 'relationship', 'ended', 'father', 'intrusion', 'caused', 'act', 'betrayal', 'Thesecond', 'was', 'Johanna', 'Reiss', 'Johanna', 'Ter', 'Steege', 'Beethoven', 'immortal', 'beloved', 'met', 'whenthey', 'were', 'younger', 'was', 'involved', 'brother', 'Caspar', 'One', 'night', 'Johanna', 'was', 'tomeet', 'Beethoven', 'hotel', 'was', 'arrive', 'much', 'later', 'expected', 'so', 'sent', 'letter', 'herinforming', 'tremendous', 'love', 'never', 'received', 'letter', 'left', 'thehotel', 'heartbroken', 'lonely', 'arrival', 'discovery', 'absence', 'Beethoven', 'went', 'intoa', 'rage', 'terrible', 'miscommunication', 'caused', 'Johanna', 'marry', 'brother', 'Caspar', 'have', 'ason', 'Karl', 'Van', 'Beethoven', 'whom', 'was', 'actually', 'Ludwig', 'son', 'Johanna', 'Beethoven', 'were', 'bothaware', 'Beethoven', 'life', 'began', 'decline', 'dissolution', 'relationship', 'Hesought', 'harm', 'Johanna', 'death', 'brother', 'was', 'eventually', 'successful', 'inobtaining', 'guardianship', 'son', 'corrupt', 'court', 'Beethoven', 'ceased', 'composing', 'wasdetermined', 'transforming', 'Karl', 'virtuoso', 'son', 'grew', 'hate', 'him.Schindler', 'discovers', 'Beethoven', 'third', 'lover', 'Anna', 'Marie', 'Erdody', 'IsabellaRossellini', 'Johanna', 'Beethoven', 'immortal', 'beloved', 'point', 'finest', 'partof', 'film', 'Johanna', 'realization', 'reading', 'Beethoven', 'letter', 'memories', 'ofhim', 'are', 'superbly', 'portrayed', 'final', 'piece', 'story', 'clear', 'many', 'women', 'were', 'inawe', 'enigmatic', 'man', 'were', 'love', 'incredible', 'passion.The', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'excellent', 'particular', 'music', 'course', 'anddirection', 'was', 'filmed', 'Czech', 'Republic', 'many', 'great', 'shots', 'show', ""country'sbeauty"", 'One', 'particularly', 'extraordinary', 'shot', 'displays', 'Beethoven', 'sitting', 'hotel', 'bed', 'storm-filled', 'window', 'had', 'smashed', 'rage', 'just', 'moments', 'before', 'shot', 'completelyGothic', 'style', 'passion', 'held', 'heart', 'Johanna', 'amazingscene', 'Beethoven', 'what', 'be', 'final', 'performance', 'Symphony', 'number', 'nine-Odeto', 'Joy', 'thinking', 'childhood', 'abusive', 'father', 'drunken', 'rages', 'YoungBeethoven', 'would', 'escape', 'bedroom', 'window', 'roof', 'run', 'themoon-lit', 'countryside', 'pond', 'where', 'would', 'set', 'afloat', 'disappear', 'starrynight', 'end', 'scene', 'shown', 'aerial', 'view', 'eventually', 'isfloating', 'space', 'amongst', 'gigantic', 'sea', 'stars', 'extremely', 'illustrative', 'showing', 'howBeethoven', 'escaped', 'physically', 'mentally', 'painful', 'childhood', 'experienced', 'due', 'hismaniacal', 'father', 'who', 'often', 'thrashed', 'so', 'hard', 'caused', 'hearing', 'deteriorate', 'wouldeventually', 'lead', 'permanent', 'deafness', 'later', 'life', 'When', 'Johanna', 'readBeethoven', 'letter', 'shown', 'window', 'Schindler', 'outside', 'cameramoves', 'forward', 'stopping', 'just', 'window', 'see', 'Johanna', 'crying', 'Beethoven', 'voice', 'isheard', 'reciting', 'letter', 'shot', 'excellent', 'depiction', 'Johanna', 'sadness.The', 'costumes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'particular', 'beautifully', 'colored', 'dresses', 'gowns', 'thewomen', 'are', 'adorned', 'Beethoven', 'music', 'heard', 'almost', 'continuously', 'film', 'andit', 'scenes', 'extremely', 'well', 'diluting', 'narrative.Overall', 'Immortal', 'Beloved', 'stunning', 'piece', 'work', 'Rose', 'moments', 'directorialbrilliance', 'very', 'solid', 'characterization', 'felt', 'pain', 'particularly', 'Johanna', 'are', 'effectivein', 'communicating', 'viewer', 'disparity', 'due', 'social', 'statuses', 'sadness', 'mysteryand', 'romance', 'most', 'passion', 'seemed', 'thrive', 'hearts', 'so', 'many', 'peopleduring', 'Romantic', 'period']",N/A

However, I am afraid in this role as Beethoven, he just seems like Gary Oldham ""acting"".He consistently starts shaking his head as if he has Parkinson's disease as he conducts. Where does it say in history that Beethoven did this?The costumes look as if they were rented from a Halloween store. The accents are very wooden and fake, and the acting is way too dramatic and overblown. Some scenes play out like a campy Saturday Night Live skit based on Beethoven. You can't help but laugh at some of the ""serious"" scenes because of the cheesy acting. Especially the fight scene where he hits the man with TB, and the man proceeds to bleed from his mouth.If you can make through the first half of the film, which seems to drag, the second half of the film is where it gets amazing. The cinematography really takes off and there are some genuinely touching moments.There are moments  watching Beethoven execute music  that are very effective. Especially when his nephew states that he (Beethoven) has gone mad, and occasionally blurts out a few notes that are the basis for a great orchestration. You will recognize the ""few notes"" and be floored when they are finally played out.However this movie caters to the movie going public.

17341,A2Z9FXHC1L66EW,0767824407,"Mr. ""alan5973""","[13, 16]","Having seen Immortal Beloved, I have a much stronger respect for Beethoven, as well as his contribution to this world...his music.The movie...ahhh, the movie. My personal opinion...a masterpiece. It affects me to such a degree every time I experience it, that I always cannot leave without deep emotion on my face. How would you feel if someone opened your mind to something in an entirely new light? You never saw it that way until they showed you. This is what the film does for me. Rich cinematography, luscious locations...some untouched, that still look the way they would have looked back in Beethoven's day.  A tragic love story in the best sense.Who was Beethoven's Immortal Beloved? No one knows. But after his death a letter was found in his own handwriting, written to someone only referred to as &quot;My Immortal Beloved.&quot; Beethoven Scholars have argued for centuries as to who this woman could be. The director, Bernard Rose, gives his interpretation of who she was, with much care in making it seem plausible. For us non Beethoven Scholars, it's simply a beautiful, tragic love story...a story that cannot help but endure the test of time.Gary Oldman, doesn't just play Beethoven...he is Beethoven...or at least a very strong interpretation of what the man must have been like. When I watch the film, I don't see Gary Oldman...I see Beethoven. A man torn apart by hardships. Beaten by his father because he was not as brilliant a child prodigy as say, Mozart was...more that he was stubborn and unwilling to play the popular tripe of the times. Oldman shows us many sides to Beethoven...the youth, in which he is close to his brothers and a bit of a scoundrel with the ladies. But somewhere along the line, he changes into an angry, bitter old man who is mad at the world. The fact that someone like him, who should have had perfect hearing that should be, as he puts it, &quot;a higher degree in me,&quot; is deaf and cannot hear his own music when he plays it...at least, not the way we hear it. Beethoven's deafness was not the kind where you hear silence. He heard noise...although this is speculative, many believe he suffered from a condition that caused his hearing to become more and more painful as the years followed.One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Beethoven lowers his head onto a piano so he can hear the vibrations more powerfully. And with that he begins to play Piano Sonata No. 14 (quasi una fantasia) in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 2...Moonlight Sonata, I. Adagio sostenuto. In the film it is played about twice as fast as it is normally played, never losing its allure in the process. Director Bernard Rose wanted to do this simply because he felt it grabs you more intensely when played a bit faster. An amazing scene that should be watched again and again.Anton Felix Schindler, played brilliantly by Jeroen Krabbe, was the man who worked closest with Beethoven, at times being treated quite badly by the maestro. Jeroen plays the man as being very submissive...most of the time we only see what he's feeling through body language and eye gestures.  As Ludwig discusses his music with Schindler during the very first time they meet, the look on Schindler's face as he listens to Beethoven is like a revelation...never has he heard or felt such passion and pain. He is drawn to tears. A most powerful scene that evokes the human spirit.  The brilliance of Beethoven is unquestionable.Director Bernard Rose gives many wonderful and interesting visual interpretations through Beethoven's music. Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67, I. Allegro con brio is used during the shelling of Vienna by Napoleon.  But perhaps the most remembered is Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, IV. &quot;Ode To Joy,&quot; in which we witness a young Ludwig, escaping from his sadistic father through his bedroom window on the 2nd floor and running away, lying on his back in a nearby lake at night. The pullback shot from straight up shows us the stars glittering all around him from the reflection in the water and continues to pull back until Beethoven disappears and is one with the stars themselves...quite symbolic.To me, this a very special movie. The fact that the director may have taken some poetic licensing to tell the story seems justified when you are engrossed in the entire product. But many people, still to this day, dislike the movie because of that reason. But where the film, Amadeus, was mostly based on fictional storytelling, Immortal Beloved is based more on fact, which is what got it into trouble and why it was met with so many mixed reviews. I personally feel these people are just missing out on a great film and great storytelling at its best. But you be the judge...see Immortal Beloved. I guarantee you'll never be able to listen to Beethoven's music quite the same way ever again.&quot;Go on loving me. Ever yours. Ever mine.

This movie tries to re-create the life of Beethoven from his youth to his death and speculates on his love life, the ""Immortal Beloved"" in some of his writings.I don't want to give the plot secrets away, but you'll find the way that the pieces connect intriguing. It has you wondering for most of the film. And the director tries to weave together the music Beethoven creates with the events in his life, and the Beloved. To me, that was a bit of a stretch.One area the movie handles very well is the descent of Beethoven's mood and demeanor as he becomes increasingly deaf and frustrated. The only mistake (but you'll understand why they did it) that I know of is in handling the first performance of the 9th symphony. But it is forgivable. :-)Overall, this is a good movie, and a bit romantic.

Although Gary Oldman performed his role very well, the story line is rather uninspiring and dull.The whole suspense of the film revolves around a mysterious letter that is uncovered after the death of Beethoven. In the letter, he mentions a certain ""immortal beloved"" as being the object of his affections. Not knowing who that might be, Beethoven's close friend (Jeroen Krabb&eacute;) goes out to search the mystery woman. The film then goes back in time to explore Beethoven's prior loves. The film of course tries to focus on Beethoven's character and music but those seem to take a backdrop to the melodrama which is unfortunate. Another poor choice is using Sir Georg Solti's symphonic direction as part of the sound track. Beethoven composed his music in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when your typical orchestra was small: his music wasn't intended to be played by the 300+ member orchestras directed by Solti. Also, Solti is from the same tradition of other great directors such as Karajan who tended to have a slower interpretation of these pieces.  Solti was probably the most conservative of that tradition and, as a result, many aspects of Beethoven's symphonic works are simply muffled by the cacophony resulting from his direction.  He literally fossilizes the music to such a degree that his interpretations are horribly sluggish and completely at odds with Beethoven's revolutionary zeal.Although this is an above-average film, I think it could have been done much better: especially in the selection for the soundtrack.

This is the tantalising premise for director Bernard Rose's film, and for it's first half it's compelling and beautifully made. Then Rose blows it, with a red herring about Beethoven's adoption of his brother's son, and though we do eventually return to the search, this misguided structure loses the audience. Fortunately, Rose floods the soundtrack with that glorious music. Rose coached a magnificent performance out of Virginia Madsen in Candyman, and does the same thing here for Valeria Golino, Isabella Rosellini, and to a lesser degree, Johanna Ter Steege. These women's eyes and skin and voices are shockingly intimate. As Beethoven, Gary Oldman looks right but is all externals. He bases his performance on the composer's deafness, turning him into a tormented neurotic which undermines Rose's romantic conceit (though isn't it always the miserable ones who creates things of great beauty?). Rose has eerie fun with acoustics, giving us Ludwig's distorted perspective, although he lacks the tabloid sensibility to match Ken Russell's flamboyant bio's. Russell too supported the exclusively autobiographical notion of an artist's work and Rose even makes the deafness Freudian.

In much the same way, it also serves as a fine historic insight on Beethoven's life and career in music. Although there has to be alterations of the truth, for the most part, Beethoven's long-suffering life and genius are masterfully portrayed. The focus of the movie, embellished by Beethoven's greatest instrumental works, is the secret identity of the ""Immortal Beloved"", an enigmatic woman for whom Beethoven wrote incredibly passionate letters. It is up to the viewer to decide which of the three women Beethoven was involved with is his Immortal Beloved, each woman striking in her own character, especially the Countess, played by Isabella Rossalini.The score is all Beethoven an appropriate for the scenes. The film is lush and visually stimulating, Vienna ballrooms and palaces, the wide boulevards, the secluded gardens in a villa, the concert halls and Beethoven's music studio. The opening music, as Beethoven's funeral is under progress, is his Kyrie from Missa Solemnis, a profoundly moving choral work. The Moonlight Sonata is played when Beethoven buries his head over his piano and broods in sadness, the Kreutzer Sonata is played as Beethoven's coach speeds on a highway in the middle of a rainstorm, Beethoven's 3rd symphony as Beethoven talks about his music to his brother's sister, Beethoven's 9th symphony, with the  thrilling chorus ""Ode To Joy"" as Beethoven reminisces about his hard-knock life as a boy and must deal with his deafness, and finally, the Fifth Piano Concerto, called the ""Emperor concerto"" as the final credits roll.Quality film, striking cinema, fine performances by Gary Oldman and Isabella Rossalini, and the most beautiful music ever to grace the screen.

17352,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0767824407,Reviewer,"[45, 55]","Ludwig van Beethoven was one of the greatest composers-- some would say THE greatest-- in the history of the world.  But what of the man himself?  His passions, his loves?  The humanness behind the genius?  ""Immortal Beloved,"" written and directed by Bernard Rose, examines the man behind the music in a dramatization focusing on the mystery behind a letter-- written by Beethoven-- found among his effects after his death in 1827.  The letter bears no name or address, but was written to a woman to whom he refers as his ""immortal beloved,"" with nary a clue as to her identity.  But in his final will, it is she to whom he bequeaths his estate, and it therefore falls to Beethoven's secretary, Anton Schindler (Jeroen Krabbe), to unravel the mystery and discover her identity.  And as Schindler pursues his quest, a portrait of Beethoven, in his most human aspect, emerges.  Reminiscent of the approach taken by Orson Welles with ""Citizen Kane,"" Rose presents a riveting study of the enigmatic genius that was Beethoven.  He suggests a man driven by passion and ego, who was under appreciated during his lifetime (as great artists often are), and who grew bitter in the wake of the slings and arrows fate so surreptitiously hurled at him.  The great irony of his life, of course, was the deafness that deprived him of the aural beauty of his own creation, an affliction Rose implies was brought about through the brutality of a drunken father who would beat his son about the head and ears (And in retrospect, what a testimony to his genius, that he could write such music in his head without ever hearing an actual note).  As Beethoven, Gary Oldman gives an outstanding performance, one for which he should have received acclaim that somehow was never forthcoming.  His ability to create a total character, with such incredible emotional depth as he does here, is astounding.  It's puzzling as to why so many of his performances are overlooked, especially at Oscar time.  Besides this film, consider his work in ""Sid and Nancy,"" or more recently in ""The Contender.""  He is simply a tremendous actor who has yet to have his day in the sun.  As Beethoven, he so completely immerses himself in the character that his soul is veritably reflected in his eyes.  You feel the silent world in which he was confined for most of his life, and it allows you to identify with the inner turmoil with which he had to cope and endure without respite.  Most importantly, Oldman makes you feel that unabashed passion that motivated and drove Beethoven on.  It's quite simply a remarkable performance.  Turning in notable performances as well are Isabella Rossellini, as Anna Marie Erdody, one of the women in Beethoven's life who may or may not have been the one to whom the letter was intended, and Johanna ter Steege, as Johanna, Beethoven's sister-in-law and the mother of his beloved nephew, Karl (Marco Hofschneider).  The supporting cast includes Miriam Margolyes (Nanette), Barry Humphries (Clemens), Valeria Golino (Giulietta), Gerard Horan (Nikolaus), Christopher Fulford (Casper), Alexandra Pigg (Therese) and Luigi Diberti (Franz).  Beethoven's renown today, of course, exceeds even mythological proportions, which often facilitates the blending of fiction with fact.  But with ""Immortal Beloved,"" whether or not the finer points are historically accurate or not is of little consequence, for at it's heart this is a love story that is engrossing drama that is altogether transporting.  It's a memorable film, highlighted by Oldman's performance and, of course, the music.  And there are a number of scenes, as well, that are unforgettable and demand mention.  One depicting the debut performance of the ""Ode to Joy,"" and another in which the young Beethoven (played by Leo Faulkner) runs at night through the streets of the city to escape his drunken father (Fintan McKeown), coming at last to a lake, into which he wades to float on his back; and with the camera positioned directly above, looking down upon him, a billion stars are reflected in the water around him.

17355,A1GHO6BR5J0NHX,0767824407,Richard Masloski,"[1, 2]","IMMORTAL BELOVED has wonderful acting, great photography, beautiful settings, gorgeous costume design, a superlative soundtrack by the Man himself and a gripping premise.  The premise is the genuine mystery as to the identity of Beethoven's ""Immortal Beloved.""  That is the only name he ever gave the unknown woman in some letters only found after his death. Even those letters had been secreted away in a hidden desk drawer. The sad thing about this movie is that the great enigma, the ""Rosebud"" of Beethoven's life, should have remained an enigma.  The revelation of the woman as shown in this film is absolutely absurd and also gives viewers a palpably phony sense of history.  The only person who really gives credence to the identity of the lady as ridiculously revealed in the soap opera denouement of this film is its writer and director Bernard Rose.  And sadly, the big reveal actually threatens the richly told rest of it all: there is the magnificent sequence wherein Beethoven remembers running from his abusive father to lose himself by floating in a lake under the starry skies, becoming a part of the universe by way of its reflection in the lake in which he floats - all this during the exulted climax of the Ninth as it is being performed for the first time.  A truly great setpiece! But then there is the absurd cat-and-mouse comedy in the sequence where the shrouded mysterious Immortal Beloved runs down the grand staircase just as Beethoven rushes in!  Whenever I see it I am reminded of the classic song whose lyrics run ""I went down to Alabamy to see my dear old mammy, I went in the front door when she went out the back door, we didn't see each other for six months...""  Yes, life has comedy and absurdity in it just as it has those moments of the sublime.  But by feeling the itch to identity the Immortal Beloved, Rose's movie almost sinks.  ""Rosebud"" is one thing, because Kane is a fictional character.  But how much better IMMORTAL BELOVED would have been if the answer to who that person was was left...unanswered.  Yes, explore the possibilities, as the film beautifully does.  But leave it unanswered.  That would have been not only more historically honest given that no serious Beethoven scholar buys into Johanna as being the one - but more vitally it would have made the movie even that much more poetic.  With his secret dying with him, we would have felt even more for Gary Oldman's Beethoven than we now do.Why must movie makers make up things???  I've reviewed COPYING BEETHOVEN here on Amazon as well - and that was a genuine fictional farce!  I've just watched BEETHOVEN'S NEPHEW from 1985, directed by Paul Morrissey. Unfortunately it is apparently only available on VHS - yet the actor playing Beethoven comes closet to capturing not only the near-identical look of the composer, but his complex character as well.  As terrific as Oldman is in IMMORTAL BELOVED and as okay as Ed Harris was in COPYING BEETHOVEN, Wolfgang Reichmann comes closest to giving us a true sense as to what the real man was like.  All three movies, by-the-way, showcase the premiere performance of the Ninth - and, in many ways, it is most exceptionally done as shown us in Morrissey's little-known film.  If you can get a copy of this movie, I highly recommend it.  It is low-key and filmed in the leisurely manner of BARRY LYNDON - and for some that will be a big minus, for others a powerful plus. The thing is it has much to recommend it.As for IMMORTAL BELOVED it is a mostly terrific film and a great intro to Beethoven provided you have a shaker of salt with you when you watch it.  But apart from the unneeded revelation of the Beloved, one other thing bothers me: why, on the DVD cover, does Gary Oldman as Beethoven look more like Bill Maher than either Gary Oldman or Beethoven?

Bernard Rose's film is a masterpiece in its own right, a rich tapestry of love and genius mingled together. It is a passionate film, that clearly understands and feels not only the music, but the mind of a genius like Beethoven. So what if a lot of the material may be fictional? So what? The movie is still brilliant, moving and unforgettable. The photography is rich, the music grand and voluptous (of course, it's Beethoven's music!) and the performances are always convincing. Gary Oldman brilliantly plays Beethoven. There's also a tenderness, a sweetness to the story, which shows that yes, even grumpy geniuses who only live in their own worlds composing beautiful music fall deeply in love. Rose takes us into the world of Beethoven. The ending is also surprising and convincing, you'll never guess who the immortal beloved is. &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot; as a whole is beautiful, grand, hypnotic, exquisite and brilliant. Beethoven himself would be proud. It is a must-see for music lovers, art lovers and people who simply love a great love story put on film. Nice flick to see for a couple.

17357,AGZVS6M8XJGN6,0767824407,"Roberto Frangie ""Robert""","[0, 0]","'Immortal Beloved' opens with Beethoven's death, followed by his funeral attended by the mourning masses...Beethoven's final will and testament are found by the composer's mentor, Anton Felix Schindler (Jeroen Krabb&eacute;) who reads that all of Beethoven's music and fortune shall go to his sole heir, his secret passion, his immortal beloved...No one then, or now, knows who the 'immortal beloved' is...Director Bernard Rose decided it might be interesting to take a guess... So he framed his film in a puzzled story with Beethoven's confidante searching across Europe for clues...Determined not to rest until he discovers the maestro's greatest love, Schindler travels to see several ladies in an attempt to learn the identity of the woman who meant so much to Ludwig van Beethoven...Along the way, he meets with three candidates: Giulietta Guicciardi, Beethoven's attractive piano pupil, to whom Ludwig dedicated his 'Moonlight' sonata; Johanna Reiss, Beethoven's immoral sister-in-law, who 'could not hate the man who could write such music;' and Anna Marie Erd&ouml;dy, the beautiful Hungarian Countess, who opened her heart to the German composer...All of the mentioned women loved Beethoven, and one of them could certainly be his angel, his all, his other self...With the use of the Ninth Symphony's ""Ode to Joy,"" there is a beautiful shot of young Ludwig floating in the firmament, lost thereafter between the luminous celestial bodies... Another scene is quite poignant of Beethoven, unaware even that the music had ceased, is also unaware of the tremendous burst of applause that greeted it...'Immortal Beloved' is a love story which not only captures the ideas of early 19th century romanticism, but ultimately attempts to fasten the emotional state of the music to the events that Beethoven lived through... We are given a look into the composer's personality... Beethoven is seen impatient, impulsive, unreasonable and intolerant; deafness adds suspicion and paranoia to these attributes...We are invited to watch his treasured feelings... We are even touched by an artist who yearns to express himself creatively through music... He is an hostile, obstinate lover who would fly into a rage at the slightest provocation, but a sensible human being who carries the music in his heart, and whom the thorns of life had wounded so deeply...Like all pianists of the late 18th century, Beethoven is raised on the sonatas of expressive music at a time when music was regarded as the art of pleasing sounds... The dramatic scene of his 'Moonlight Sonata' communicated to a deafened ear, expresses all his emotional pain: We listen beautifully what he cannot... He reveals, through his delightful piece, his soul and the inner torment he is suffering... We perceive what the music is evoking in his mind... we also find that he is a temperamental lover who seeks to reach the perfect love...With finesse and style Gary Oldman stars as the first composer, always stubborn, unyielding and struggling against destiny... Oldman seems to feel the brave, the commanding, and the impetuous of the virtuoso pianist more than what is reassuring or gentle... The muscles of his face swell, and its veins start out... His wild eye rolls doubly wild... His mouth trembles as he looks overpowered with the character's deafness, strengthened by a stubborn nature...Set in Vienna, but exquisitely shot in and around Prague, 'Immortal Beloved' concentrates on Beethoven's women, his cruel battle for custody and control of his little nephew, his constant fight with himself, with the sound of agitation...'Immortal Beloved' is a film enriched by a passion, drama and turbulence of an era... The scenery of the aristocratic palaces, elegant middle class town houses, churches and chapels, monuments and fountains are beautiful and exquisite... Beethoven's compositions (wonderfully performed by the London Symphony Orchestra) are splendid and voluptuous...",3,An unforgettable event of cinematic poetry...,1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,3946,"[""'Immortal"", 'Beloved', 'opens', 'Beethoven', 'death', 'followed', 'funeral', 'attended', 'mourning', 'masses', 'Beethoven', 'final', 'will', 'testament', 'are', 'found', 'composer', 'mentor', 'Anton', 'Felix', 'Schindler', 'Jeroen', 'Krabb', 'eacute', 'who', 'Beethoven', 'music', 'fortune', 'shall', 'go', 'sole', 'heir', 'secret', 'passion', 'immortal', 'beloved', 'one', 'then', 'now', 'knows', 'who', ""'immortal"", 'beloved', 'Director', 'Bernard', 'Rose', 'decided', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'take', 'guess', 'So', 'framed', 'film', 'puzzled', 'story', 'Beethoven', 'confidante', 'searching', 'Europe', 'clues', 'Determined', 'not', 'rest', 'maestro', 'greatest', 'love', 'Schindler', 'see', 'several', 'ladies', 'attempt', 'learn', 'identity', 'woman', 'who', 'meant', 'so', 'much', 'Ludwig', 'van', 'Beethoven', 'way', 'three', 'candidates', 'Giulietta', 'Guicciardi', 'Beethoven', 'attractive', 'piano', 'pupil', 'whom', 'Ludwig', 'dedicated', ""'Moonlight"", 'sonata', 'Johanna', 'Reiss', 'Beethoven', 'immoral', 'sister-in-law', 'who', ""'could"", 'not', 'hate', 'man', 'who', 'could', 'write', 'such', 'music', 'Anna', 'Marie', 'Erd', 'ouml', 'dy', 'beautiful', 'Hungarian', 'Countess', 'who', 'opened', 'heart', 'German', 'composer', 'mentioned', 'women', 'loved', 'Beethoven', 'one', 'could', 'certainly', 'be', 'angel', 'other', 'self', 'use', 'Ninth', 'Symphony', 'Ode', 'Joy', 'beautiful', 'shot', 'young', 'Ludwig', 'floating', 'firmament', 'lost', 'thereafter', 'luminous', 'celestial', 'bodies', 'scene', 'quite', 'poignant', 'Beethoven', 'unaware', 'even', 'music', 'had', 'ceased', 'also', 'unaware', 'tremendous', 'burst', 'applause', 'greeted', 'Beloved', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'ideas', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'romanticism', 'ultimately', 'attempts', 'fasten', 'emotional', 'state', 'music', 'events', 'Beethoven', 'lived', 'are', 'given', 'look', 'composer', 'personality', 'Beethoven', 'seen', 'impatient', 'impulsive', 'unreasonable', 'intolerant', 'deafness', 'suspicion', 'paranoia', 'attributes', 'are', 'invited', 'watch', 'treasured', 'feelings', 'are', 'even', 'touched', 'artist', 'who', 'express', 'creatively', 'music', 'hostile', 'obstinate', 'lover', 'who', 'would', 'fly', 'rage', 'slightest', 'provocation', 'sensible', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'music', 'heart', 'whom', 'thorns', 'life', 'had', 'wounded', 'so', 'deeply', 'pianists', 'late', '18th', 'century', 'Beethoven', 'raised', 'sonatas', 'expressive', 'music', 'time', 'when', 'music', 'was', 'regarded', 'art', 'pleasing', 'sounds', 'dramatic', 'scene', ""'Moonlight"", 'Sonata', 'communicated', 'deafened', 'ear', 'emotional', 'pain', 'listen', 'beautifully', 'what', 'can', 'not', 'delightful', 'piece', 'soul', 'inner', 'torment', 'suffering', 'perceive', 'what', 'music', 'evoking', 'mind', 'also', 'find', 'temperamental', 'lover', 'who', 'reach', 'perfect', 'love', 'finesse', 'style', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'first', 'composer', 'always', 'stubborn', 'unyielding', 'struggling', 'destiny', 'Oldman', 'feel', 'brave', 'commanding', 'impetuous', 'virtuoso', 'pianist', 'more', 'what', 'reassuring', 'gentle', 'muscles', 'face', 'swell', 'veins', 'start', 'out', 'wild', 'eye', 'rolls', 'doubly', 'wild', 'mouth', 'trembles', 'overpowered', 'character', 'deafness', 'strengthened', 'stubborn', 'nature', 'Set', 'Vienna', 'exquisitely', 'shot', 'Prague', ""'Immortal"", 'Beloved', 'concentrates', 'Beethoven', 'women', 'cruel', 'battle', 'custody', 'control', 'little', 'nephew', 'constant', 'fight', 'sound', 'agitation', ""'Immortal"", 'Beloved', 'film', 'enriched', 'passion', 'drama', 'turbulence', 'era', 'scenery', 'aristocratic', 'palaces', 'elegant', 'middle', 'class', 'town', 'houses', 'churches', 'chapels', 'monuments', 'fountains', 'are', 'beautiful', 'exquisite', 'Beethoven', 'compositions', 'wonderfully', 'performed', 'London', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'are', 'splendid', 'voluptuous']",N/A

17360,A1JUYF5D6TFFHB,0767824407,"Rudy Avila ""Saint Seiya""","[16, 20]","In 1994, British director Bernard Rose released &quot;Immortal Beloved&quot;. The full-length film is now on DVD, with commentary by the director, trailers for the film, a documentary on the real life of composer Ludwig Van Beethoven and behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie. It's a must have for fans of the film, which had a following mostly of music lovers or history buffs. I want to convince you that this film is Oscar worthy for Best Picture or Best Actor (Gary Oldman as Beethoven). Or it could have at least won Best Costumes. It's a terrific film that the 1995 Oscars neglected. The Academy failed to see the powerful drama of this film. It's a work of art. I don't understand how if Amadeus, a film about the fictional account of Mozart and Salieri, two music composers, could win Best Picture in 1984 (only 10 years before Immortal Beloved) why did they ignore the Oscar potential of this movie ? And Gary Oldman truly deserved recognition for his work as Beethoven. I believe that year, Tom Hanks won Best Actor for Forrest Gump, a good performance as well but Gary Oldman truly deserved it more in my opinion. Oldman (from 1992's Dracula) is a veteran British film star with many American films to his credit, an excellent actor and captivating screen presence. As Beethoven, he truly transformed himself into the very essence of Beethoven himself. Not only does he physically and anatomically look like a Beethoven brought to life on the screen, but his acting was able to tap into the spirit of Beethoven's personality. He is mercurial, he is intense, he is passionate, he is tormented, he is romantic and gentle. The film seems to indicate that Beethoven's deafness was due to the beatings his abusive father gave him as a boy. His escape of the trauma inspired his greatest work of music- the revolutionary Ninth Symphony. Like Amadeus, some of the film is fiction and fabricated simply for the sake of drama or plot. But a lot of it is true to the time of Beethoven (early 19th century 1800-1820's) and some portions remain accurate to Beethoven's career as a composer. The mysterious Immortal Beloved was true. Love letters to this Immortal Beloved were found upon Beethoven's death and to this day there are different theories on who the enigmatic lover must have been.The film opens with Beethoven's death. Beethoven, frail and pointing towards heaven as lightning strikes, takes his final breath. This is reportedly true by an eyewitness account of the time. Afte his funeral, Jerome Krobbe's character and Beethoven's brother decide to investigate who the Immortal Beloved was by digging up as much information on the women he loved in his life. They encounter that there are three &quot;suspects&quot;- a divorced Countess with children (Isabella Rossalini in a great performance), Beethoven's brother's wife, or a beautiful piano student of his. The lush cinematography and vibrant location- the film was shot on location in Beethoven's native Austria- enhances the milieu of the film and it's gorgeous to look at. Authentic costumes is another superb element of the film. The scenes of Napoleon's invasion of Vienna are historically accurate as well. Beethoven and Napoleon were contemporaries and initially, tricked by Napoleon's propaganda, Beethoven believed that Napoleon's government was going to open up doors of opportunities for equal rights in a new Enlightenment. But Napoleon's promises were false and he crowned himself Emperor and his reign was totalitarian. This upset Beethoven so much that he tore off the dedication to Napoleon from his Third Symphony (Eroica).The final portions of the film are probably the best. Beethoven, approaching old age, has trouble with his nephew Karl, who attempts suicide at one point, and is still pining over the woman he loved but could not have. Especially fatalistic was the lost encounter between the two during a rainstorm at a hotel. This is also taken straight from letters that were found and are true to Beethoven's life. Beethoven composes his final symphony- the Ninth- as he remembers his tragic childhood. He conducts the Ninth himself, eventhough he is much older, and dazzles the Vienna public with a bold new creation- the symphony with a chorus (the Ode to Joy). The film uses the music from the symphony very dramatically and effectively, visually and score-wise in the soundtrack. The soundtrack is also available on Amazon.com and is a must buy if you loved the all-Beethoven program featured in the film- his Eroica Symphony, the Moonlight Piano Sonata, The Fifth and Sixth Symphonies, The Kreutzer Violin Sonata and the Emperor Piano Concerto No. 5, which is used brilliantly as the film closes. Beethoven's Immortal Beloved reads the letter that Beethoven wrote to her on the occassion of that fateful night at the hotel, becomes emotional and visits the tomb of Beethoven. This was the actual tomb of Beethoven in Austria that is seen in the film. This film is worth watching time and again, is perfect for music appreciation courses and as already mentioned, a film that cries Oscars but that Oscar was blind to.",5,Beloved Beethoven: The Film

But much can be said about the narrative ruse to position a biopic about him as a mystery, to tell his story in a fresh 'Citizen Kane' kind of a way -- through other people's recollections.To its credit, the music selection works very well to imbue the right effects at the right times, and some scenes evoke powerful emotion, such as a life-altering beating he received from his father as a child, or how he got the inspiration for his ninth symphony.Problem is, all of it runs a little too long at 2:03 as it attempts to cover a sprawling ground. Half an hour into it, the screenplay falls prey to too much melodrama. Beethoven frequently comes across as a crude, short-fused, obnoxious man, making it difficult to care about his musical genius.Acting wise, Oldman's potrayal of the madness manifesting itself in art rather than homicidal acts is fairly impressive.

And who will stand beside him? He was an artist. And what he was, he was only through music.The thorns of life had wounded him deeply. So he held fast to his art even when the gate through which it entered was shut. Music spoke through a deafened ear to he who could no longer hear it. He carried the music in his heart.Because he shut himself off from the world, they called him hostile. They said he was unfeeling and called him callous. But he was not hard of heart.It is the finest blades that are most easily blunted, bent or broken. He withdrew from his fellow man after he had given them everything and had received nothing in return. He lived alone because he found no second self.Thus he was. Thus he died. Thus he will live for all time.***Immortal Beloved is a film that deeply affected not only the course of my life, but also the quality. Yes, I was very much aware of Beethoven before seeing this movie and I had heard the bulk of his music being an active listener of classical music and a student performer. But after seeing the dramatization of some of the more ""stormy"" and ""troubling"" portions of his life, played aptly by Gary Oldman, in this lavish production for the modern audience, I came away with an even deeper understanding of not just this man's music, but his contribution for all of us, music as a whole and music as something alive.Mstistlav Rostropovich, now deceased and much missed, stated that he felt that Beethoven and Mozart did not die, that yes, they still exist -- even if on a subatomic level, and primarily because of the legacy of the music and the immense amount of love that the world has for them and always will. Thus, the music keeps them alive with every new student at the piano, violin or cello.This Epic Masterpice opens, surprisingly, with a vividness that is reminiscent in films like Dr. Zhivago, Lawrence of Arabia, Spartacus or Ben Hur and drops you into this now vanished historical Vienna like a fly on the wall and is done so well, one might just believe that it actually is Vienna. The swelling sound of the `Missa Solemnis' in the background is yet another example of Beethoven's genius to create something new, rather than re-interpret theStabat Materas was traditionally done by all his predecessors. Most of the film was actually shot in the Czech Republic which had been almost forgotten by the process of modernization. Street lights, payphones, stoplights, road signs, power lines, television antenna - you name it. This is also the same location where they had filmed the much hyped and beloved `Amadeus', and for the exact same reason and a whole decade earlier.As blasphemous as this might sound to some, it is my contention that Ludwig van Beethoven is probably the most influential and important living being that has ever graced our people. In one thousand, five thousand, ten thousand years from now, as abstract of an idea as that is to some, young children will still be setting down at pianos to learn his sonatas, his symphonies and his Fur Elise. His work will be mainstay in the progress of mankind.  I will save any and all comment about Jesus Christ, as that is a conversation for another forum. But the unfortunate, but struggling truth about religion, is that it is not as equal to all of us as music is. A Hindu family or a Buddhist family, for example, with no desire for Christianity may never experience the Bible, but they'll happily play `Sonata Quasi una Fantasia' in their living rooms and fully enjoy the work for what it is. For these reasons, Herr Beethoven will live on forever and influence billions more of us in the many years to come, thus enriching the human experience where the words of our prophets may fall deafly or unheard.The stigma that seems to follow this film, from reading all the reviews online that came out during its release, the reviews on Amazon, the comments on IMDb, is that people bemoan that it is a Hollywood production. Probably in time, this stigma will fade, as the unpopular machine that Hollywood is today, won't last. Bernard Rose is a wonderfully knowledgeable and passionate Director and musician who labored over the idea of this film, wrote the screenplay and orchestrated its creation. The stigma that this film is a Hollywood production and that it misses the mark on Beethoven's life is not just grossly unfair, but inaccurate. People often comment that `Amadeus' is a better film when they talk about 'Immortal Beloved', I guess because they are equally two movies about famous composers. But the real truth is that `Amadeus' is a fictionalized version of a stage play titled `Mozart & Salieri'. 'Immortal Beloved' is historically rich and a close and accurate portrayal of the events of Beethoven's life and the lives of those that he was closest to.Joahnna ter Steege plays the part of Johanna Reiss / van Beethoven who Bernard Rose believes, beyond a shadow of a doubt, is the actual `Immortal Beloved' of the very illustrious and now famous love letters that were found after his death. Without going into detail about why he felt this way, I'll just say that 'obsession' had a lot to do with it. `Beethoven's Letters' is an excellent source book for anyone interested in reading his personal letters in their complete and translated glory. Ivory Tower academians seem to disagree with Rose about his choice, but most of those that disagree, all seem to have books that they're pushing about some other woman that you may, or may not have heard of.Also to note, most of those that disagree with Bernard Rose, take him to be a novice, a buffoon and a bounder on the subject of Ludwig van Beethoven and all typically attack him as a non-musician who has little to no knowledge of the composer. They also seem to be in lock-step about how he egregiously gives our beloved, but ugly hero the Hollywood treatment. One needs to just listen to the incredibly informative and very telling Director's Commentary buried within the disc to learn that this is not the case in the slightest. You'll not only come to learn that Bernard Rose has been a fervent musician since childhood, but also incredibly well-read on the subject of the Maestro.Some of my favourite scenes in the movie involve the character of Anton Schindler, Beethoven's secretary and friend, also played wonderfully by Jeroen Krabbe. Jeroen was actually called upon to originally play Beethoven in this, but gracefully stepped aside when he learned that Gary Oldman was successful in being cast. A tear usually wells up in my eyes when I hear the Largo from `The ""Ghost"" Trio' played in the garden, which is by far my favourite Beethoven piece and close to being one of my favourite music pieces of all time.I guess it must be noted that Anton Schindler, who, before his own death in 1864, published the first 'large volume biography' of Herr Beethoven in 1840. Schindler was unfortunately accused of white-washing history for the sake of hiding his friends vice and licentious behaviour. Thankfully, enough information survived to paint a better picture, but regarding Schindler's text, one shouldn't throw away the baby with the bath water.The use of multiple narration should also be noted. It's wonderful to hear all of the main characters, including the aging Hotel Frau, Nanette Streicherov&aacute;, warmly and richly recounting their portions. All weaving such an enthralling and engrossing tale that you just can't look away. I must also note, that Frau ""Striecher"", as he spelt it, was a person who Beethoven had much correspondence with through the years and considered a friend. I think the narration is something that hardly ever gets mentioned regarding this film, but film narration is a tricky beast that is difficult to pull off and often fails. The writing here does this medium justice and is seamless in 'Immortal Beloved'.I will admit that the first time I saw this in the theatre, I was brought to tears multiple times. Consequently, when I purchased the DVD, I was equally moved on multiple occasions by so many aspects of this film that they're just to dense to list. Of this, I will spare you.I have included the eulogy in the beginning of the review, as I believe it is an integral portion of information when understanding the life of Beethoven. It is no mistake or mystery that Bernard Rose puts this at the very beginning as well, because if you listen carefully to the text, the intonation and timing of Jeroen Krabbe's delivery of it, you learn the intent and the real story that Rose is about to unfold for you. This is a real masterpiece of filmmaking in every sense of the phrase and will hold the spot as the most memorable film about Beethoven for some time to come. It will take a strong performance to best it.If Bernard Rose chose Franz Grillpazer's eulogy as the theme to `Immortal Beloved', which does seem to be the case, I don't think that we can slight him for this, as history has now documented the truth that Anton Shindler's Beethoven is imagined, while Grillpazer's flawed, tormented and misanthropic friend once lived and breathed. I don't think it's inappropriate for Bernard to have made this choice, as he has been castigated for, simply because - Grillpazer was a friend and an acquaintance, he was a neighbor and a roommate, he was someone who had casually listened to Beethoven play (a fact that destroyed their friendship) and someone who had discussed operatic collaborations with the Maestro as well.I wouldn't take Franz Grillpazer's words as the gospel, but I would come to assume that they were accurate from his point of view, from the point of view of history and also heartfelt.Having read almost every biography on Beethoven printed in English, I find Bernard Rose's Beethoven incredibly plausible and at least true to the spirit and temperament of Beethoven (and may I say, also in fact). The idea that he never chased a half-naked woman because he was ""a prude"" is absurd. Yes, he was a prude, but he was also known to be lecherous and doting when it came to women, he would most definitely chased half-naked women anywhere. ReadMaynard Solomon's Beethoven, orhis essaysand then readThayer's Life of Beethoven, a two volume set, and you'll see a vast difference. Perspective and personal bias are always inescapable.This is probably one of my top three favourite films of all time.

Of course the sound tracks are nearly always excellent, but the plots range from good (occasionally) to abominable (all too often). Milos Foreman's Amadeus demonstrates the former, while a host of films, worst of all Ken Russell's The Music Lovers (Tchaikovsky) bring up the rear. Immortal Beloved might be only a small bit better, in spite of an interesting plot, except for one outstanding factor. Gary Oldman's portrayal of Beethoven is wonderful. Oldman is one of those actors who lacks the name recognition that he deserves because he acts so well that only his character is memorable. In Immortal, he brings an exceptional force to Beethoven as a man past his brilliant prime and at the very limit of rationality. When one sees the power yet subtlety he uses in doing so, it's difficult to forget how inferior most film acting is today by comparison.

This movie should be purchased, watched and kept for two reasons: Gary Oldman's portrayal of Beethoven, and Beethoven's music itself. The movie is a tribute to Beethoven's music. Just as Amadeus was a tribute to the music of Mozart, so is Immortal Beloved a tribute to Beethoven. Beethoven had a very problematic life and had personal issues with virtually everyone he knew. Oldman captured the essence of that tortured soul, and the juxtaposition of Oldman's portrayal with Beethoven's music is very moving and will stay with you for days.

We join the story when he has shuffled off his mortal coil and leaves behind an unhappy sibling as he has left his entire estate to his `Immortal Beloved'. But who can this person be? His erstwhile friend and secretary Anton Schindler (Jeroen Krabbe) who had discovered the last will and testament and takes it upon himself to track down this woman.On his travels we get the story in flash back. This includes many times his music and the reasons or more often, the emotions that caused him to compose such pieces. As the tales unfold the mystery of his life and loves starts to become clearer and he is revealed as a very complex character indeed.As expected this is a simply brilliant production with great attention to period detail and acting that is all Academy nomination material and we have some excellent players including Isabella Rossellini and Barry Humphreys. Gary Oldman shows why he has had such a shining career with a performance that illicits contempt and sympathy in equal measure.

Especially interesting was the interpretation that the martial refrain of the choral part of the Ninth corresponding to Beethoven joyfully running as a boy.  This was a very appropriate interpretation, as a translation of the German for that part of the chorus corresponds to ""run brother along your road"".  The young Beethoven is also seen to float in a stream at night such that a view from above shows him to be surrounded by the reflection of the starry sky--a moving allusion to the chorus singing ""uber Sternenzelt"" (over the starry expanse).

I am curious as to whether or not they had the same reaction to &quot;Amadeus&quot; (which is also based on a grand premise that has been dismissed by most historians.)  Still not satisfied?  Okay then, how about this... no one billed this film as a documentary.  Like &quot;Amadeus&quot; it uses well known facts to weave a fantasy.  If the producers are to be criticized, then let us now and forever more abandon the realm of historical fiction, and declare the area off-limits.  Hollywood will surely not comply.  Beethoven's personality itself was the stuff of rumor and legend, and many of us (myself included) place him on a gilded throne, and are unwilling to accept a portrayal of him that is (as is presented in this film) not without his serious human flaws. (If you think the guy didn't have issues, check out the biography by Maynard Solomon.) We want to LIKE Beethoven, and many scenes in this movie make it hard for us to sympathize with him.  Our hero brought low... oh the horror. I think this film has taken him from the ivory tower and laid him out like a tragic Greek hero, who's passions become the source of his undoing.  Yes, it was hard to watch.  I do not know If I could watch it again, but I appreciate it.  It is a fictional tale meant to give a more human interpretation of a man we hold in pristine glory.  That's it.... an interpretation.  Don't buy it if you don't want to.

Gary Oldman is magnetic as Beethoven and the supporting cast does an admirable job of making the story of Beethoven's life interesting to the modern viewer.  It is a great film to watch if you are interested in learning something of Beethoven's life however it does take great creative liberties with the storyline around revealing who the ""Immortal Beloved"" truly is.  Watch this movie for Oldman's intense preformance and for the music - not for the made up ending.  If you are anything like me, you will run out and buy every piano concerto Beethoven wrote and listen to it with renewed insight into the human being the great composer was!",4,Will inspire you to learn more about Beethoven,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,767,"['can', 'not', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'do', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'who', 'classical', 'music', 'period', 'dramas', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'magnetic', 'Beethoven', 'supporting', 'cast', 'admirable', 'job', 'making', 'story', 'Beethoven', 'life', 'interesting', 'modern', 'viewer', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'are', 'interested', 'learning', 'something', 'Beethoven', 'life', 'however', 'take', 'great', 'creative', 'liberties', 'storyline', 'revealing', 'who', 'Immortal', 'Beloved', 'truly', 'Watch', 'movie', 'Oldman', 'intense', 'preformance', 'music', 'not', 'made', 'up', 'ending', 'are', 'anything', 'will', 'run', 'out', 'buy', 'piano', 'concerto', 'Beethoven', 'wrote', 'listen', 'renewed', 'insight', 'human', 'being', 'great', 'composer', 'was']",N/A
