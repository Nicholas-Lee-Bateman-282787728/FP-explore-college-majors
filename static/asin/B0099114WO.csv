1587039,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0099114WO,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","There is something almost sad about the way in which `Hope Springs' is received as a comedy.  I mean, while watching the film I couldn't help but smile and or chuckle uncomfortably in certain spots, but the film truly is NOT a comedy or even really all that funny when viewed in the context of the film and so there is something tonally off about our willingness as a society to view this as a comedy based solely on the fact that the main protagonists are an old couple.  Seriously, watch the same movie with some young actors like Anne Hathaway and Joel Edgerton and you'd have a very serious and somewhat heartbreaking film.Instead, we laugh.`Hope Springs' tells the story of Kay and Arnold.  Their children are grown and out of the house and their relationship has dissolved into a puddle of mundane and they suffer through routine and engage each other nearly NONE of the time.  Kay is fed up and wants a real relationship, with talking and sex.  Arnold is not interested.  He's content with the way things are.  That's when Kay throws counseling in his face and basically says ""I'm going with or without you, but without you means this marriage is over"" and so Arnold begrudgingly gets on the plane.  Next thing you know they are sitting in front of Steve Carell and spilling their guts (or at least Kay is) and he's giving them exercises that Arnold is hesitant to perform.  He doesn't even want to hold her hand.The concept of the film and even the overall handling of it are truly dramatic in tone and rich with so much meaning and yet they are bogged down by this preconceived notion that `old people making love = comedic gold'.  I don't understand this idea and yet I fall victim to it myself.  The scene in the hotel room when they are getting passionate on the floor would have been seen as hot if actors twenty years younger were cast in the part.  Instead, we as an audience are reduced to chuckling like prepubescent children who heard someone say the word ""wiener"".It's silly and disheartening.Still, my uncontrollable reaction and all, this film is far more engaging and speaks to a deeper place than I expected.  Streep and Jones are wonderful here, each playing off one another with so much heart and soul.  Jones is especially effective as the stone hearted gruff who learns to let his guard down (sort of).

1587052,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0099114WO,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","Hope Springs is, as you can probably guess given the actors and actresses starring in it, mostly suitable for the older (50 years or older, if not 60) marriage couples.  Of course this is entirely a comedy so you're supposed to be laughing... and the good news is that it *is* a funny movie overall.  Believe it or not however, several portions of the film actually provide useful information for any couple who's marriage no longer contains the spark that it once did.  I'm referring to the parts that focus on Steve Carell playing the part of the marriage counselor.  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones of course play the wife and husband, and they are very good in their respective role.  Almost *too* good, haha.Meryl Streep wants to seek a 4,000-dollar counselor to help figure out her marriage, and with much reluctance, Tommy Lee Jones eventually decides to go along with it.  Now admittedly some portions of the discussion that takes place in the marriage counselor room are pretty graphic and personal, so please be prepared for these sexual-related discussions that focus on the act itself, the sexual position in which is most enjoyable for them, pleasuring ones self, etc.  It gets somewhat dirty (or honest, depending on your viewpoint) but this is really the *only* part of the movie that ever approaches this level of dirtiness.  The rest of the movie is remarkably clean and appropriate.Now, I've never been married so I've never been to a marriage counselor, but the way these meetings develop gradually seems incredibly realistic.  The comedy takes a much subtle approach than what I was expecting.  For example, the moment the personal subject of sex is brought up with graphic and specific questions, and Meryl buttons her shirt as a way to reveal she's uncomfortable going into detail, is an example of subtle comedy that's easy to miss if you're not 100% attentive.  The ending is perhaps one of the more unique endings I've seen.  While you can probably guess what happens at the *very* end, the stuff during the final 20 minutes is somewhat surprising to me.  Just goes to show how bumpy a marriage can be over the years when everything becomes static and nothing changes.  The VERY final line is incredibly funny though.  I won't spoil it, but something is said involving the neighbors during the marriage counselor meeting earlier on, and when it's finally brought up again near the end... NOW I get it. :)As a man, as weird as this may sound, this movie actually shows me how much women care about marriage.  It's important to a man too of course (because it involves two people making major permanent changes that the other has to adjust to) but Hope Springs further proves how important it is for a woman to connect with her spouse on a personal level and physically touch them in bed.  Good detail there.  The one thing that's hard to believe is that, this marriage got to the point that Meryl and Tommy Lee were no longer sleeping in the same room anymore.  Has anyone out there heard of a marriage getting to this point?  Even the people I know who have rocky relationships- they always end up sleeping in the same bed at least.  *Always*.  Seems somewhat far-fetched but I could be wrong.Overall, great movie.  Of course given the fact the cast is over the age of 60, you can probably guess that it's going to be a slow-moving down to earth type relationship storyline, and trust me, it is.  You have to really slow down your thinking process to appreciate the style that's taking place here.  You don't necessarily need experience in marriage troubles to grasp it, but it would probably make the movie even more rewarding if you did.",4,need marriage counseling?  just watch Hope Springs!,1370822400,"06 10, 2013",2013,3665,"['Hope', 'Springs', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'given', 'actors', 'actresses', 'starring', 'mostly', 'suitable', 'older', '50', 'years', 'older', 'not', '60', 'marriage', 'couples', 'course', 'entirely', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'laughing', 'good', 'news', 'funny', 'movie', 'overall', 'Believe', 'not', 'however', 'several', 'portions', 'film', 'actually', 'provide', 'useful', 'information', 'couple', 'who', 'marriage', 'no', 'longer', 'spark', 'once', 'did', ""'m"", 'referring', 'parts', 'focus', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'playing', 'part', 'marriage', 'counselor', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'course', 'play', 'wife', 'husband', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'respective', 'role', 'Almost', '*too*', 'good', 'haha.Meryl', 'Streep', 'seek', '4,000-dollar', 'counselor', 'help', 'figure', 'out', 'marriage', 'much', 'reluctance', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'eventually', 'go', 'along', 'Now', 'admittedly', 'portions', 'discussion', 'place', 'marriage', 'counselor', 'room', 'are', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'personal', 'please', 'be', 'prepared', 'sexual-related', 'discussions', 'focus', 'act', 'sexual', 'position', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'pleasuring', 'ones', 'etc', 'somewhat', 'dirty', 'honest', 'depending', 'viewpoint', 'really', '*only*', 'part', 'movie', 'ever', 'level', 'dirtiness', 'rest', 'movie', 'remarkably', 'clean', 'appropriate.Now', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'married', 'so', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'marriage', 'counselor', 'way', 'meetings', 'develop', 'gradually', 'incredibly', 'realistic', 'comedy', 'much', 'subtle', 'approach', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'example', 'moment', 'personal', 'subject', 'sex', 'brought', 'up', 'graphic', 'specific', 'questions', 'Meryl', 'buttons', 'shirt', 'way', 'reveal', 'uncomfortable', 'going', 'detail', 'example', 'subtle', 'comedy', 'easy', 'miss', ""'re"", 'not', '100', '%', 'attentive', 'ending', 'perhaps', 'one', 'more', 'unique', 'endings', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'what', '*very*', 'end', 'stuff', 'final', '20', 'minutes', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'Just', 'show', 'how', 'bumpy', 'marriage', 'can', 'be', 'years', 'when', 'everything', 'static', 'nothing', 'changes', 'VERY', 'final', 'line', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'something', 'said', 'involving', 'neighbors', 'marriage', 'counselor', 'meeting', 'earlier', 'when', 'finally', 'brought', 'up', 'again', 'end', 'NOW', 'get', 'man', 'as', 'weird', 'may', 'sound', 'movie', 'actually', 'how', 'much', 'women', 'care', 'marriage', 'important', 'man', 'too', 'course', 'two', 'people', 'making', 'major', 'permanent', 'changes', 'other', 'adjust', 'Hope', 'Springs', 'further', 'how', 'important', 'woman', 'connect', 'spouse', 'personal', 'level', 'physically', 'touch', 'bed', 'Good', 'detail', 'there', 'one', 'thing', 'hard', 'believe', 'marriage', 'got', 'point', 'Meryl', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'sleeping', 'same', 'room', 'anymore', 'Has', 'anyone', 'there', 'heard', 'marriage', 'getting', 'point', 'Even', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'have', 'rocky', 'relationships-', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'sleeping', 'same', 'bed', 'least', '*Always*', 'somewhat', 'far-fetched', 'could', 'be', 'wrong.Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'course', 'given', 'fact', 'cast', 'age', '60', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'going', 'be', 'slow-moving', 'down', 'earth', 'type', 'relationship', 'storyline', 'trust', 'have', 'really', 'slow', 'down', 'thinking', 'process', 'appreciate', 'style', 'taking', 'place', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'need', 'experience', 'marriage', 'troubles', 'grasp', 'would', 'probably', 'make', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'rewarding', 'did']",N/A

Ad...","[0, 0]","Okay- so we have two great movie stars playing a long married couple.They have marriage problems, only Tommy Lee Jone's character doesn't think so.Or at least doesn't admit to it.He looks at Meryl Streep like she has 3 heads when she suggests this * get away* for the two of them.I mean why would you want to get away with your wife? And much less to a place that is supposed to * help* your marriage?As far as he is concerned- there is nothing wrong and he resents her suggestion.It does not take long for arm-twisting to work on him- via a sense of guilt and worry.He caves in, thanks to guilt, not an outward recognition of marriage problems.Tommy Lee Jones makes no bones about how much he hates going- then hates being there, and what a big waste of time and money the whole idea is.Basically ,he is a wet blanket, while Meryl tries to remain cheery and keeps plodding ahead with the game plan for the two of them.She wants her marriage to be like it use to be- or - if possible, even better than it use to be, when she was happy.Tommy Lee remains totally oblivious to her unhappiness or to the fragile state of their marriage.Meryl Streep as the silent, long suffering wife, who should have spoken up many years ago, can only sit and wring her hands over his antics and foul attitude during their *get -away*.He embarrasses her- he is curt and hurtful.I was actually wondering why her character even wanted to stay married to him!His portrayal as such a cantankerous, cold husband was convincing.What was not convincing is Meryl's desire to want this man to remain as her husband so badly, that she sets up this trip as an intervention.The movie would have been great if there had been more substance to the plot.I mean, it was not like Meryl and Tommy Lee did not play their parts well- it is just that you got a glossing over regarding each of their characters.I would have liked to have  known them better- especially the past versions of themselves,instead of who they were at the time the movie takes place.So yes, I feel the movie suffered from lack of character development or any revealing insights about the characters lives over the years.Flashbacks to their first meeting and early days of marriage would have been nice, too.Just when did this marriage begin to grow stagnant?And why would anyone let it remain that way for so long?These are questions I had and I realize this movie did depict real life and how marriages can suffer from neglect; I was just waiting and hoping those answers would come as I watched patiently.(Instead, I was rewarded with a movie that just sort of dragged along; keeping enough momentum to make you want to know how it was going to end, while still watching the clock to see how much time was left to wrap this whole thing up.)Soon, I found myself becoming annoyed at the whiny couple- when initially I had been sympathetic toward Meryl's character.1 hour or so into the movie,  I found myself annoyed as I realized it just was not going to get any better.I am glad I rented this one and did not see it in theaters.Both stars are enjoyable to watch, but  in far better movies they have made over the years.In my opinion, this is worth skipping. You won't be missing much.For those with nothing to do, or who are into watching a movie about a couple in conflict, be my guest and draw your own conclusions.",3,I really wanted to like this movie but it was quite lackluster,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,3354,"['Okay-', 'have', 'two', 'great', 'movie', 'stars', 'playing', 'long', 'married', 'couple.They', 'have', 'marriage', 'problems', 'only', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jone', 'character', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.Or', 'least', ""n't"", 'admit', 'it.He', 'looks', 'Meryl', 'Streep', '3', 'heads', 'when', '*', 'get', 'away*', 'two', 'them.I', 'mean', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'get', 'away', 'wife', 'much', 'less', 'place', 'supposed', '*', 'help*', 'marriage', 'As', 'far', 'concerned-', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'suggestion.It', 'not', 'take', 'long', 'arm-twisting', 'work', 'him-', 'sense', 'guilt', 'worry.He', 'caves', 'thanks', 'guilt', 'not', 'outward', 'recognition', 'marriage', 'problems.Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'bones', 'how', 'much', 'going-', 'then', 'being', 'there', 'what', 'big', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'whole', 'idea', 'is.Basically', 'wet', 'blanket', 'Meryl', 'remain', 'cheery', 'plodding', 'ahead', 'game', 'plan', 'two', 'them.She', 'marriage', 'be', 'use', 'be-', 'possible', 'even', 'better', 'use', 'be', 'when', 'was', 'happy.Tommy', 'Lee', 'totally', 'oblivious', 'unhappiness', 'fragile', 'state', 'marriage.Meryl', 'Streep', 'silent', 'long', 'suffering', 'wife', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'spoken', 'up', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'only', 'sit', 'wring', 'hands', 'antics', 'foul', 'attitude', '*get', '-away*.He', 'her-', 'curt', 'hurtful.I', 'was', 'actually', 'wondering', 'why', 'character', 'even', 'wanted', 'stay', 'married', 'portrayal', 'such', 'cantankerous', 'cold', 'husband', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'convincing', 'Meryl', 'desire', 'want', 'man', 'remain', 'husband', 'so', 'badly', 'up', 'trip', 'intervention.The', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'substance', 'plot.I', 'mean', 'was', 'not', 'like', 'Meryl', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'parts', 'just', 'got', 'glossing', 'regarding', 'characters.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'known', 'better-', 'especially', 'past', 'versions', 'instead', 'who', 'were', 'time', 'movie', 'place.So', 'yes', 'feel', 'movie', 'suffered', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'revealing', 'insights', 'characters', 'years.Flashbacks', 'first', 'meeting', 'early', 'days', 'marriage', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'too.Just', 'when', 'did', 'marriage', 'begin', 'grow', 'stagnant', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'let', 'remain', 'way', 'so', 'long', 'are', 'questions', 'had', 'realize', 'movie', 'did', 'depict', 'real', 'life', 'how', 'marriages', 'can', 'suffer', 'neglect', 'was', 'just', 'waiting', 'hoping', 'answers', 'would', 'come', 'watched', 'patiently', 'Instead', 'was', 'rewarded', 'movie', 'just', 'sort', 'dragged', 'keeping', 'enough', 'momentum', 'make', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'still', 'watching', 'clock', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'left', 'wrap', 'whole', 'thing', 'up', 'Soon', 'found', 'becoming', 'annoyed', 'whiny', 'couple-', 'when', 'initially', 'had', 'been', 'sympathetic', 'Meryl', 'character.1', 'hour', 'so', 'movie', 'found', 'annoyed', 'realized', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'get', 'better.I', 'am', 'glad', 'rented', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'theaters.Both', 'stars', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'far', 'better', 'movies', 'have', 'made', 'years.In', 'opinion', 'worth', 'skipping', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'missing', 'much.For', 'nothing', 'do', 'who', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'couple', 'conflict', 'be', 'guest', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions']",N/A

1587119,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0099114WO,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","In August 2012, a new comedy titled ""Hope Springs"" from David Frankel (director of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Marley and Me"") was released in theaters.Written by Vanessa Taylor (""Alias"", ""Gideon's Crossing"") and starring Meryl Streep (""The Devil Wears Prada"", ""Doubt"", ""Adaptation""), Tommy Lee Jones (""No Country For Old Men"", ""The Fugitive"", ""Men in Black"" films), Steve Carell (""The Office"", ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"", ""Crazy Stupid Love""), Jean Smart (""Designing Women"", ""Graden State""), Elisabeth Shue (""Back to the Future"" films, ""Leaving Las Vegas""), Ben Rappaport (""Outsourced"", ""The Brass Teapot"") and Marin Ireland (""I Am Legend"", ""Revolutionary Road"", ""The Manchurian Candidate"").Receiving positive reviews for the performances by Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carell, ""Hope Springs"" did well in the box office (considering the summer blockbuster competition) as the film budgeted at $30 million would go on to earn over $104,000.  And now, ""Hope Springs"" will be released on DVD in December 2012.VIDEO & AUDIO:""Hope Springs"" is presented in 2:40:1 Anamorphic Widescreen and is presented in English and French 5.1 Dolby Digital and also presented with an English - Audio Description Track.  It is important to note that for those who want the best picture and audio quality, there is a Blu-ray release version available for ""Hope Springs"".  Picture and audio quality are good as expected on DVD.  Some scenes may be a bit dark at times but for the most part, the film does look good on DVD and the soundtrack is primarily dialogue and music-driven and audio primarily coming through the front and center channels.  But for a movie like ""Hope Springs"", PQ and AQ on DVD is good.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Hope Springs"" comes with the following special features:Commentary with Director David Frankel - Featuring an informative audio commentary by director David Frankel.Gag-Reel - (5:07) Bloopers from ""Hope Springs"".Inside the Perfect Movie Marriage: Meryl Streep & Tommy Lee Jones - (3:53) Brief interview with Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones who talk about their characters and the film.Exploring the Scene - Alternate Takes Gallery - (17:48) Featuring four alternate takes: Motel Speech, Marital Gripes, First Time You Said It and Feld's Second Wife with optional introductions by director David Frankel.EXTRAS:""Hope Springs"" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows owners to download the film to their computer and select Apple and Android devices and have the ability to stream to computers, tables or smartphones.JUDGMENT CALL:An enjoyable comedy with a storyline that should have been made long ago.""Hope Springs"" is a storyline that many older adults can relate to. It's one thing to be in love and grow old with your partner, but how does one keep the passion strong and alive?I don't know how many couples I have known that are like the characters Arnold and Kaye.  Couples who are devoted with one another, but somehow intimacy has decreased a lot as the years go by.As I get older, I find it fascinating how conversation with my friends have changed when it comes to relationship topics when we were in our 20&#8242;s and then in our 30&#8242;s and now in our 40&#8242;s and some friends who are in their 50&#8242;s or 60&#8242;s.  There are many men and women who simply give up the intimacy and when I hear from guys who get all bummed out when they tell me they had not had any sexual intimacy with their wife in years, suffice to say, it's sad to hear that older couples just give up the intimacy or no longer into it.So, for years, I have always wondered when a film would be created on the subject.  We always see movies about the new couple who have children and lose intimacy but what about the older couples?Yes, I understand that Hollywood doesn't focus on older couples as much anymore.  When I really think about it, the films that have explored it took place back in the '90s with films such as ""Father of the Bride 2&#8243; which starred Steve Martin and his wife who is older but is expecting a baby, along with her daughter who is also about to give birth.But there aren't any films that tackle on intimacy.  And maybe it's because it's something that many Americans face when they get older and some may consider it a depressing topic because perhaps intimacy for many couples don't exist or are as not as strong when one gets older.That's why I really enjoyed ""Hope Springs"" and its message of how couples, no matter how great their marriage is, both need to try and become intimate.  It's one thing to hug and to hold but open communication about one's needs in a relationship, no matter what age you are, is important.And the performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep feel natural.  Arnold is a man who is uncomfortable discussing his sexual fantasies or problems with a doctor, while Kaye feels this is the only way she can get her husband to be intimate by bringing in professional help.  Meryl Streep is a wonderful actress and to see both she and Tommy Lee Jones having fun in the film, not only was it fun to watch but I found myself hoping that many other couples who have lost that spark, maybe will try to regain it with their loved one right after watching this film!  It's quite inspiring and definitely a film that just makes you feel good because it is a film about relationships but also hope despite the problems a married (or unmarried) couple may have despite the many decades they have been together.Along with Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep, the performance by Steve Carell was also rather fascinating.  No comedy role or weird facial gestures, Carell plays the straight up Dr. Feld and is intent in helping this couple achieve true intimacy.  It's possibly the most serious role I have seen Carell be part of and it's great to see him trying something different and not be the actual funny man of the film.As for the DVD, as mentioned in my review, while PQ and AQ are good on DVD, for those wanting the best picture quality and lossless audio, will definitely want to watch this film on Blu-ray.  Otherwise, the DVD does look and sounds good and also includes special features such as audio commentary, gag reel, interviews with Streep and Jones plus a featurette with alternate scenes.An enjoyable, fun, mature comedy for adults and ""Hope Springs"" is a film long overdue.

1587140,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0099114WO,Ed Uyeshima,"[66, 71]","When I saw Meryl Streep play the seemingly facile Omaha housewife she portrays in this 2012 marital dramedy, I had an immediate flashback to an underrated romantic drama she did almost thirty years ago, Ulu Grosbard'sFalling in Love(1984), in which she played a young married woman who couldn't help falling for a married architect (Robert De Niro) on a commuter train. I kept thinking of Kay as that earlier character all these years later trying to fan the embers of the passion that erupted so unpredictably back then. Interestingly, her younger character could not consummate the affair either but fell hopelessly in love anyway. Director David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada) and first-time screenwriter Vanessa Taylor travel to the opposite end of the marital spectrum, a 31-year-old marriage that finds Kay and her accountant husband Arnold sleeping in separate bedrooms having long ago lost any sense of intimacy and passion their marriage once had. The film begins with a seriocomic preface in which Kay awkwardly tries to seduce Arnold, an invitation he rebuffs with the flimsiest of excuses. Knowing their marriage is on auto-pilot, she fears being alone emotionally and ending their lives in emotional isolation now as they go through the motions in their sixties.An optimist despite the odds, Kay signs them up for a week of intensive couples therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine, where renowned therapist Dr. Bernie Feld practices. Arnold is predictably resistant but begrudgingly accompanies her when he realizes how serious Kay is about the counseling. The sessions with Dr. Feld initially don't go well with Arnold protesting the doctor's every recommendation for building intimacy in his relationship with Kay. This is when the movie becomes the most surprising because every time a physically awkward moment presents itself, the feelings become heartfelt and sometimes humorous in unexpected ways. While Frankel and Taylor handle the slim story turns with genuine insight, it's the masterful work of Streep and Tommy Lee Jones that elevates the film into an experience that far transcends the Lifetime-TV orientation you would expect otherwise. Unafraid to come across as harshly judgmental, Jones has made a career of playing dyspeptic curmudgeons, so it's nice to see him gradually reveal Arnold's vulnerabilities with skill and delicacy. He has to play Arnold close to the vest but not so insular as to make you wonder what Kay saw in him in the first place. After tackling larger-than-life figures like Julia Child and Margaret Thatcher, Streep is splendid portraying a sheltered woman who contributes as much to the fossilized, inchoate marriage as Arnold does.At 63, the actress allows herself to look even beyond her age, but she's still beautiful in a shopworn way. I love how she almost swallows every word she speaks as if Kay's tentative nature is holding back grand expectations of a romance she can only fantasize about. The two veteran actors have a natural rapport that gives the viewer a rooting interest in seeing them overcome their age-old emotional and physical barriers. There are moments between them especially in the film's last third that are quite heartbreaking, especially when they come to learn that they aren't the people they believed themselves, or each other, to be. Steve Carell plays Feld straight-up without an iota of irony, and his clinical approach works effectively within this context. The rest of the supporting cast makes very little impact, including Jean Smart as Kay's sassy manager at the Coldwater Creek she works part-time, Elisabeth Shue as an equally sassy barmaid counseling Kay on sex, and Mimi Rogers as the final payoff of a joke about a comely (and yes, sassy) neighbor with a trio of corgis. The young actors who play Kay and Arnold's adult children are barely present, but I'm sure that was part of the intention in order to allow complete focus on the couple.

In this send up, the Wife is still very much kicking.  Meryl Streep, our leading chameleon, is now about as frowsy a housewife as could be, and still be respectable.  She's well worn, yet smarter than her perpetually cheerful demeanor would seem to indicate, and she wants a marriage, or more specifically Her Marriage, back.  Her curmudgeon of a husband, perfectly played by Tommy Lee Jones, has the occasional fantasy---apparently featuring a neighbor--but no interest in his wife, whatsoever.  So she books a flight to Maine, to see a renowned relationship counsellor, for them both, and takes off without him, having given her husband the Ultimatum.It's not an adventurous film, aside from having older actors, no nudity, sex, violence or special effects (apart from Ms. Streeps makeup).  It's funny, touching, and sometimes a bit sad, by turns.  It'd make a great afternoon film.  Of a similar vein, one could go to the radio program &#34;This American Life&#34;, to it's archives (a few years back now), and look up the title &#34;Someone To Watch Over Me&#34;, where the second show in that program features a retired SF Bay Area cop and his wife, in the rut of ruts, until she decides to go to Mexico with her girl friend.

He was so complex, which made him the most interesting character. Did this man realize he was taking his wife for granted? I don't think he did. I wanted to know his backstory to find out why he had such a problem with showing affection.Marriage: It's not how many years that matters, but the relationship. Arnold kept saying he and Kay were married for thirty-one years as if that meant something when it was obvious their marriage was in trouble. The focus was mainly on their sex issues, but they had other issues. I found it interesting how their position on the marriage counselor's couch each time they went told a lot about the progress they were making resolving their problems.So basically, Hope Springs is a well-acted dramatic film about a married couple needing help with their sex life. There were parts I wasn't comfortable with,but, all in all, it was okay.

They both have settled into the routine of their lives.  The wife is very aware that it has grown stale and she longs to have that spark put back into their relationship.  The husband doesn't understand this, but when he realizes he might lose her and that she is serious, he unwillingly goes along with it.  What truly makes this movie are the two lead actors, Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.  They both offer exceptional performances bringing comedy and drama into a real life situation.  Meryl ads just the right girlishness into her character, Kay, while Tommy invokes a guy cut off from all emotion as her Husband, Arnold.Although these days I wonder who is still around that has been married for 31 years. My generation doesn't seem to have a handle on long term relationships to begin with. They do not know how to make it work or are even aware of what it truly entails. It's not all hearts and roses. This movie would be a great documentary on how to show that marriage and long term relationships are serious business.Kay enrolls she and her husband into a week long extensive couples therapy session in Hope Springs, Maine. It's a quaint, cottage like town where everyone knows that many of the visitors are there to meet up with the head couples counselor, Dr. Feld, played by Steve Carrell.  Kay is desperate to revive her marriage at all costs and Arnold will be forced to get into it whether he likes it or not.Do they find a newness in each other and passion for what was once there?  You'll have to see the movie to find out.  I enjoyed this look at a married couple finding an avenue to breath new life into their relationship.  It was very honest and moving.  The movie manages to keep it light while finding just the right moments to bring in the emotion.  This is mainly successful due to the gifted actors playing the roles.  In less capable hands, this movie would've fallen into a snooze fest.  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones are a delight to watch in action.Other movie goers who prefer the blow 'em blockbusters that move at a fast pace will likely be bored with this though. I imagine those not knowing much about the seriousness of relationships will also likely want to slit their wrists while watching this. I loved it and I think anyone who has had problems in a long term relationship will be moved by this movie.

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[0, 1]","As many have noted, this was completely mismarketed as a comedy, and I can't imagine who made that decision, as it set it up for failure. Once I got past that, I was able to appreciate the masterful performances Streep and Jones give in this movie as a 'mature' couple struggling to rekindle the intimacy in their marriage through an intensive counseling program run by Steve Carroll's character. Jones is outstanding as the gruff, stoic, uncommunicative and often angry husband who reluctantly faces emotions long repressed. The few comic moments are his, as he blusters along, and at times finds the wry humor of the situation. Streep is always fun to watch, and is mostly earnest and heartfelt in this film. They both mug just a little, but it's enough to keep it entertaining without it going overboard. Carroll mostly plays it straight and does a great job with his therapist role. The insights on marriage are so true, and will resonate with anyone who's been married for a period of time.  There are some flaws in the movie - some of the contemplative scenes seem very cliche, with music booming while the characters stare remorsefully out over the sea, but other than that it is spot on. And I applaud a movie like this getting made - there aren't many films getting made about romance between characters over 50.

1587265,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0099114WO,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","To begin with the title of the film HOPE SPRINGS is not a location. Rather it is about the hope that after years of marriage love and emotion can return. It's what the film is about. While some will watch and assume as the discussions involved talk about sex, that isn't what's at the core of the film.Kay (Meryl Streep) and Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones) have been happily married for years now. But times have changed. Anniversary gifts are now just shared items they need for the house. Arnold hasn't slept in the same bed with Kay for years now starting from a back injury he suffered long ago. This is a couple that has a daily routine where Arnold wakes, gets ready and goes to work with Kay making sure his day starts off with the same breakfast every morning and a peck on the cheek. But that's not enough for Kay.Kay longs for the affection and intimacy that the couples shared all those years ago. Determined to do something about it, she seeks out marriage counseling books at the local book store and comes across one written by Dr. Feld (Steve Carell). Digging deeper she finds his website online and then makes reservations for her and Arnold who of course refuses to go seeing it as a waste of money. Kay gives him two options: join her at the airport or stay home alone.Fearing he might lose her, Arnold shows up begrudgingly. They arrive on a remote small town in Maine where their week long couples retreat is to take place. Arnold is the crotchety type who complains about the costs of everything, insisting all the while that they have no reason to be here.As their sessions begin Dr. Feld talks to them about what the problem seems to be. Carell plays the role straight and doesn't resort to what some would expect of him. Feld cares about the people he treats and allows them to bring out the questions and answers that are plaguing their marriage. Where the obvious questions about their sex lives are discussed, you can tell by the direction he leads the couple in his questions and what he discusses with them it's not sex he wants them to dig deeper into. It's intimacy. It's the small caress that Arnold might brush across Kay's cheek or a kiss on the lips. But these topics don't come out at the first session, instead taking time each day they are there.One of the best things here is that the story unwinds and we discover that it's not all Arnold's fault that things have changed. One would think that was the case with the attitude he has toward the whole process and with some of the answers he provides. What we have here is a couple in every sense of the word where both share equally in the changes that have overtaken their lives. And the only way to save this marriage is for both to become an active part in that marriage once again.This movie isn't the dry film that it might sound like from what I've written so far. It's filled with lots of humor and out right affection seen in the characters offered. These seem like real people you and I know in real life, people that have a deep rooted love for one another yet have somehow lost touch. You care about both characters and watch hoping that they find the solution they need.Long time readers will know I've never been a big Meryl Streep fan but here she does a tremendous job, offering not just great readings of her lines but displaying subtle touches like body movement and longing glances that open up her character. I've always found her performances much better in roles like these than grandiose characters she has played in the past. Jones is amazing to watch. He has the grizzled old coot character down pat and if that were all he displayed here I would say his performance was mailed in. But as the film progresses you see that there is a weakness inside of him that blooms and allows his affections to finally show in this character. Since neither of these characters is in your face, my guess is both performances will be ignored come Oscar time.As I near the age that these two people are in the midst of, the movie made me look back at my own life and will do the same for anyone in their 40s on. Young viewers might want to look at it and realize what they can expect down the line unless they pay close attention. In any event this movie was a delight, offering insight into what is truly important in the lives and love of people.

Perhaps she also feels hopeful in marrying an older wiser man?  But very shortly after getting married, a three decade long disappointment ensues for Arnold and Kay since getting married for chemistry can only last so long.  With Kay's encouragement they visit a third person to help them out.  A few tips for couples (ie: no name calling, it's okay to be playful, etc) get them started and in the end, they grow to develop a peaceful love relationship although how they really got there perhaps could have used a little more clarity.  I assume that after the retreat they continue their therapy and when Arnold's work friend tells him how he had lost his wife by habitually treating her in an ungrateful way, Arnold comes around to see himself and his wife as imperfect human beings in need of human love.I think it's great that this movie got made because I imagine it could help some couples to rekindle their relationship in a more satisfying way.

Which is all well and good, but where does love fit into the equation.  Not once do they say ""We don't make love anymore"" or ""Let's make love"".  It's this ultimate tunnel vision which ultimately left me cold.  Is there love without sex?  Sex without love?  The script never clearly delineates exactly why Arnold is reluctant to show physical attention to the needy Kaye.Even so, one can't help getting involved and that's due to the superb performances from Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.  Streep has rarely been so restrained.  No real showy histrionic scenes.  None of her usual OMG moments.  Yet she is marvelous as always.  Her command of who Kaye really is enables us to identify and feel for her.  Jones is equally effective as the husband who feels the longevity of their marriage supports his idea of a successful relationship.  Steve Carell's turn as the wise marriage therapist is a nice change of pace for the usually manic performer.

Had this movie been set twenty or thirty years earlier I might have been better able to buy the storyline -- 60ish couple married over 30 years haven't shared a bedroom or had sex in five years. Wife Kay (Streep) has a parttime job in a friend's yarn and gift shop, husband Arnold (Jones) is a CPA (apparently the only one in the firm not making a good salary, as all he does is complain about the cost of everything). Wife tries unsuccessfully to seduce husband, who apparently has forgotten what certain body part are for, and decides to revive their marriage at a Hope Springs, Maine couples facility, run by Steve Carell. Arnold is  resistent to everything -- doesn't like the charming town, although he has plenty of money can hardly deal with a $12 breakfast special, and at first stonewalls every suggestion that involves sex, which means he stonewalls every suggestion as they all involve sex. Kay is more open but has some areas that bring her discomfort to discuss. The ending is very predictable.While I think that both Streep and Jones make a believable couple of the old school -- I think we have to assume that at least Arnold is among the oldest of the Baby Boomers, born between 1946 - 1949, with Kay a few years younger -- I never for an instant believed Steve Carell in his role. He played it lowkey, but he seemed to just be puckish Carell to me: my reaction was, ""oh, look, Steve Carell again."" With Streep and Jones I was able to eventually accept that they were not like  most couples that I know, due to the quality of the performances. But with all the constant emphasis on sex among the elderly (sorry, but mid-60's is not middle age) even without the aid of some erectile dysfunction drug, much of it became cringe-worthy. It was like listening to a relative or close friend talk about oral sex -- TMI! Streep looked her real age thoughout the movie, not much make up, slightly plump, but still attractive. Jones has had a craggy lived-in look for many years and has perfected the curmudgeon almost to it being a cliche.

However, the scene-stealer of the film was Steve Carell.  When I heard that Mr. Carell was playing the marriage counseler/relationship therapist in this film, I had expected a comedic version of the profession...not too different from Robin Williams's performance in ""Good Will Hunting"".  But Mr. Carell delivered yet another of the film's pleasant surprises.  While delivering the occasional witty line, he played this role very seriously, making me feel comfortible enough to talk to him...in fact, his performance reminded me of a counseler I once saw (that is a compliment.)

We learn later that both are responsible for the frigid status of their marriage, but here we see Meryl accurately portray the middle-aged woman who though embarrassed and vulnerable, haltingly and bravely takes steps to mitigate the situation.  Through the nuances of the relationship, Meryl, with believable depictions allows us to know how someone in this situation would feel.Steve Carell was remarkably believable as a therapist and Tommy Lee Jones played the angry curmudgeon he seems to know so well.

Film Critic.I went to see this movie with my mom and she was freaking out and covering my eyes in some parts, I thought it was funny and that she was overreacting.  After the movie I had to remind her that I am fourteen.  This movie is about a married couple of thirty-one years, Kay (played by Merryl Streep) and Arnold (played by Tommy Lee Jones) who love each other so much, but have not been affectionate or intimate with each other in many years.  They even sleep in separate rooms, and on anniversaries they get gifts not for each other, but for the house.  Kay gets sad at the reality that she and her husband do not have a real relationship.  So she gets a book about marriage and calls the couple's counselor and schedules the intense therapy to fix her marriage.  At first Arnold refuses to go, but then reconsiders when Kate leaves without him, then reluctantly he goes with her because he does not want to lose her.  All throughout the movie Arnold is uncomfortable with therapy, and especially the intimate tasks assigned by Dr. Fields (played by Steve Carrell).  While Kay really wants to have a ""real"" relationship, Arnold is tentative and they battle with this throughout the whole movie.  This movie was very sweet in a weird way because it is based around an older and very in love couple that struggles with intimacy and I guess for a young audience, that visual would gross them out.  The soundtrack in this movie reminded me of music in a silent film because music is included in most scenes and they describe the scene, even if the words are not there.  Tommy Lee Jones is very versatile as an actor.  I have never seen him play a domestic character or anyone in a relationship, it is refreshing and he does a great job.  This movie makes me see the power in love and determination to sustain it.  My mother was shocked by some scenes but then laughed, so this would be a great movie for couples who are in a long relationship.  This is a very intriguing movie, I have not seen many with this concept, so I give it five out of five stars.  I recommend this movie for mature 13-year-olds and up. This is a good movie for a mature crowd.Video reviews available at kidsfirst dot org",5,"Very Intriguing, Great for Couples in Long-Term Relationships",1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,2262,"['Reviewed', 'KIDS', 'FIRST', 'Film', 'Critic', 'Victoria', 'B', 'KIDS', 'FIRST', 'Film', 'Critic.I', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'mom', 'was', 'freaking', 'out', 'covering', 'eyes', 'parts', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'was', 'overreacting', 'movie', 'had', 'remind', 'am', 'fourteen', 'movie', 'married', 'couple', 'thirty-one', 'years', 'Kay', 'played', 'Merryl', 'Streep', 'Arnold', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'who', 'love', 'other', 'so', 'much', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'affectionate', 'intimate', 'other', 'many', 'years', 'even', 'sleep', 'separate', 'rooms', 'anniversaries', 'get', 'gifts', 'not', 'other', 'house', 'Kay', 'sad', 'reality', 'husband', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'real', 'relationship', 'book', 'marriage', 'couple', 'counselor', 'intense', 'therapy', 'fix', 'marriage', 'first', 'Arnold', 'go', 'then', 'reconsiders', 'when', 'Kate', 'then', 'reluctantly', 'not', 'want', 'lose', 'movie', 'Arnold', 'uncomfortable', 'therapy', 'especially', 'intimate', 'tasks', 'assigned', 'Dr.', 'Fields', 'played', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'Kay', 'really', 'have', 'real', 'relationship', 'Arnold', 'tentative', 'battle', 'whole', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'sweet', 'weird', 'way', 'based', 'older', 'very', 'love', 'couple', 'intimacy', 'guess', 'young', 'audience', 'visual', 'would', 'gross', 'out', 'soundtrack', 'movie', 'reminded', 'music', 'silent', 'film', 'music', 'included', 'most', 'scenes', 'describe', 'scene', 'even', 'words', 'are', 'not', 'there', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'very', 'versatile', 'actor', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'play', 'domestic', 'character', 'anyone', 'relationship', 'refreshing', 'great', 'job', 'movie', 'see', 'power', 'love', 'determination', 'sustain', 'mother', 'was', 'shocked', 'scenes', 'then', 'laughed', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'couples', 'who', 'are', 'long', 'relationship', 'very', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'many', 'concept', 'give', 'five', 'five', 'stars', 'recommend', 'movie', 'mature', '13-year-olds', 'up', 'good', 'movie', 'mature', 'crowd.Video', 'available', 'kidsfirst', 'dot', 'org']",N/A

1587346,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B0099114WO,Robert Badgley,"[5, 5]","Hope Springs(released Aug/12)is a tour de force character study/performance starring Meryl Streep as Kay Soames,Tommy Lee Jones as Arnold Soames,Steve Carell as Dr. Bernie Feld,Elisabeth Shue as Karen and others.Streep,Jones and Carell are the mainstays of this picture,which,as Mary Poppins would say,is practically perfect in every way.The film is definitely geared to an older demographic,so don't show this one to the kids as it does have some very adult themes in it.But children of the age group portrayed,might also see something in it either of themselves(as in maybe what's to come if...) or their relatives.The story finds Streep and Jones as wife and husband,married for 31 years.Their marriage,to put it mildly,is in a funk.Jones has settled into his daily routine while Streep has come to the realization that she wants more of what the couple used to have,as far as their relationship and intimacy goes.Streep finds a book written by a therapist,who happens to also run a marriage clinic in a remote town in Maine(Carell).Streep of her own accord and without warning,pays for the $4,000 trip there,and hands Jones the tickets for the plane.He is adamantly opposed to it and vows to stay home.Come the morning of the flight Streep is off by herself to the airport and onto the plane.Just as it looks like she is really going solo,Jones appears and off they fly.The town is quaint and rustic but Jones is constantly complaining of how much everything is costing.They have their first meeting with Carell who is super professional,patient and understanding.Jones however is not very cooperative at all.The sessions go step by step,as the two try to overcome years of emotional and physical baggage.For every step forward,there seems to be one or two back.Jones is seemingly the bad guy up to a point,but we find out Streep also has alot to do with what has gone on in their marriage and relationship(it is a two way street after all).When the two get to,as the doctor describes it,""the one yard line"",a disagreement/let down almost threatens to derail the entire process.They stay the course,but the two never successfully and completely turn things around,and they end up returning home with things,sadly,back almost to square one.Streep is ready to call the marriage quits,as she actually gets packed and ready to leave.That night Jones enters her room and closes the door behind him;totally out of character(yes,they sleep in separate bedrooms).The thought of Jones losing his wife finally melts away his stubborn pride and the two finally begin their long journey back to regaining what they had lost.The film ends,and the credits roll,as Carell is presiding over the two's recommitting of their marriage vows on a beach(as per Streep's wishes).Very romantic.Watching Streep and Jones playing an average married couple(their on screen chemistry was amazing,as was their underacting!),and who talk through the cause and effects their specific marital problems have had on them and their marriage,is an absolute delight.Also Carell plays the eternally calm and pleasant therapist on whose words hangs the balance of the Soames marriage,and I give high kudos to him for his wonderful portrayal.This is definitely a movie geared for the baby boomers out there and as such,in some big or small aspect,should touch a nerve with about every one of them.For a blooper,keep an eye on Jones when during the first session where he finally opens up about his sexuality,he does a couch scooching.In one shot he's at the far end of the couch the pair sit on,the next he is in the middle,then it's back to the end again.As a matter of fact the entire couch sitting routine is something else.Streep always,unless alone,sits on the right side.Through out the sessions,and depending on how well they are going,Jones goes from the opposite end,to the middle,back,all the way beside Streep,and then back to the end.This coupled with their body language are little things that really help put the film over.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary, a gag reel,a featurette and alternate takes.All in all a wonderfully done look at the coming apart and restoring of a 31 years marriage gone wrong.It's like getting your own private therapy session,or being the bug on a wall at a real one.The threesome of Carell,Jones and Streep are simply outstanding.4-4 1/2 stars.",4,A tour de force study in characterization!,1354579200,"12 4,

Only there really isn't much if any chemistry between them, the script is banal, and the actors seem both embarrassed at and hostile to the subject matter.  Who could blame them?  And so they seek out sex therapist Steve Carell (who seems like a wormy little guy with no real personality), and sit widely physically separated on a couch, while he asks them the usual cliched questions -- ""do you have orgasms? do you experiment in bed?  are you ready to try something new?""

Meryl Streep (Kay), Tommy Lee Jones (Arnold) and Steve Carrell (Dr. Feld) go free-form in therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine.One piece of bacon with one egg, one piece of bacon with one egg, one piece of...Ok, you get the idea here. Like Arnold's unchanging daily breakfast their marriage of Thirty-One years is stuck in routine, and hurt feelings. Kay, feeling ignored, inhibited and unfulfilled after all these vested years decides to investigate for help. Will curiosity kill this cat...or awaken the sleeping lion?Eventually she finds Dr. Feld's book in the bookstore. While at home she jumps on the internet to find out about and book a stay for  intensive marriage therapy. A first disgruntled Arnold refuses although does end up in Maine along with Kay.The small town is lovely, atmospheric as it is by the water, quaint and really a place that most would love to visit. Kay immediately thought how great it was to be there while Arnold thought it over-priced: one positive and one negative as they start their sessions with Dr. Feld.What is so interesting about therapy with these actors, is that it is all done unrehearsed. Director David Frankel usually chooses to take the first cut. Causing it to go in this direction provides the viewers with seeing: very personal reactions, facial surprises, uncomfortable movements, candid speaking, outbursts and all the rawness of being vulnerable.While Kay is constantly pulling and fiddling around with the buttons on her cardigan, Arnold is grimacing and staring down Dr. Feld. The tension is perfectly palpable as the couple is learning all about each other all over again, and that things just have to change.This intensely personal look into marriage on the inside is a great opportunity to learn a few things for yourself. A brilliant and slightly comedic drama, more for adults who can see the reasons why some just won't give up.",5,"Wonderfully Uncomfortable, Hope Springs Internal ...",1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,2088,"['first', 'wanted', 'see', 'anticipated', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'then', 'thankfully', 'was', 'treated', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'pleased', 'viewing', 'home', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Kay', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Arnold', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'Dr.', 'Feld', 'go', 'free-form', 'therapy', 'Great', 'Hope', 'Springs', 'Maine.One', 'piece', 'bacon', 'one', 'egg', 'one', 'piece', 'bacon', 'one', 'egg', 'one', 'piece', 'Ok', 'get', 'idea', 'here', 'Arnold', 'unchanging', 'daily', 'breakfast', 'marriage', 'Thirty-One', 'years', 'stuck', 'routine', 'feelings', 'Kay', 'feeling', 'ignored', 'inhibited', 'unfulfilled', 'vested', 'years', 'investigate', 'help', 'Will', 'curiosity', 'kill', 'cat', 'awaken', 'sleeping', 'lion', 'Eventually', 'Dr.', 'Feld', 'book', 'bookstore', 'home', 'internet', 'find', 'out', 'about', 'book', 'stay', 'intensive', 'marriage', 'therapy', 'first', 'disgruntled', 'Arnold', 'end', 'up', 'Maine', 'Kay.The', 'small', 'town', 'lovely', 'atmospheric', 'water', 'quaint', 'really', 'place', 'most', 'would', 'love', 'visit', 'Kay', 'immediately', 'thought', 'how', 'great', 'was', 'be', 'there', 'Arnold', 'thought', 'over-priced', 'one', 'positive', 'one', 'negative', 'start', 'sessions', 'Dr.', 'Feld.What', 'so', 'interesting', 'therapy', 'actors', 'done', 'unrehearsed', 'Director', 'David', 'Frankel', 'usually', 'take', 'first', 'cut', 'Causing', 'go', 'direction', 'viewers', 'seeing', 'very', 'personal', 'reactions', 'facial', 'surprises', 'uncomfortable', 'movements', 'candid', 'speaking', 'outbursts', 'rawness', 'being', 'vulnerable.While', 'Kay', 'constantly', 'pulling', 'fiddling', 'around', 'buttons', 'cardigan', 'Arnold', 'grimacing', 'staring', 'down', 'Dr.', 'Feld', 'tension', 'perfectly', 'palpable', 'couple', 'learning', 'other', 'over', 'again', 'things', 'just', 'have', 'change.This', 'intensely', 'personal', 'look', 'marriage', 'inside', 'great', 'opportunity', 'learn', 'few', 'things', 'brilliant', 'slightly', 'comedic', 'drama', 'more', 'adults', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'reasons', 'why', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up']",N/A

It's not often I find a movie about which I have no criticism, not even the tiniest, but this is one. I also only give 5 stars to my all-time favorite movies, and I was surprised that a movie like this made the cut, as I usually categorize this type as a 3...4, tops.I think it is a movie for men, as well as women, though I wonder if the men would rather watch it alone, without their significant other, in order to avoid allowing them to see them get emotional, which undoubtedly some men will. The movie describes the frailties of men's emotions, which are too often covered up by the tough exterior expected - no, required - by society. The pressure of this idea is palpable. Though he goes down with a fight worthy to become legendary, to the end, he is eventually forced to make a choice between exposing his long-supressed hurts and fears and losing what he loves the most. Tommy Lee Jones is one of the greats and his golden performance here is not to be missed.Meryl Streep delivers as gloriously and subtly and funnily and fragilely and strongly and crushingly as one would expect from her. The burden of Tommy's character is shared by Meryl's, as well, as she must face her own failings and insecurities and make a life-altering decision.It becomes established in this movie that the unusually versatile Steve Carell is a force to be reckoned with in drama. Any naysayers will now silence themselves. No one but Clint Eastwood comes to mind offhand, though I know there are others, who can say so much with so few words as Steve did in this performance.It's Tommy's character who touches me most, though, even though I am female and one might think I would be most moved by the problems of my own gender. There's just something about seeing a rare glimpse of mushiness come begrudgingly from a strong, stern, manly man, that really melts me. Ah well, so now you know my weakness.

It's a mix of drama and comedy, but it doesn't try to make you laugh with every line of dialogue. Kay (Streep) has been married to Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones) for 31 years. The two barely talk to each other, despite living in the same house. He hasn't touched her physically or mentally in any kind of meaningful way for several years. Kay decides that she wants to recapture the magic and give new life to their boring existence. She cashes in her savings and arranges for the two to attend couples therapy with Doctor Feld (Steve Carell).After initially refusing, Arnold reluctantly agrees to Kay's ultimatum and the two fly off to attend the sessions for a few days. Arnold is grumpy, deeply suspicious of Feld, and afraid to show his real feelings. Carell plays things straight for once and is convincing as the therapist.I think the movie has limited appeal because of the nature of the humor. It's the kind that will make you squirm and maybe recognize things about some of your own past or present relationships. Even if you don't, you probably know someone in a similar situation to Kay and Arnold.The movie is quite uplifting in it's resolution and it is a pleasure to watch two such accomplished actors at the top of their game.

Of course that makes it impossible for any reviewer to properly review the item that will actually be sold since those items are NOT. YET. AVAILABLE. for purchase or review.  Please take that into consideration if you see a bunch of reviews of this item and if you really want to know if the Blu-ray or DVD is worth spending your money on, then please read carefully and find reviews here that tell you about specifics of the product as it will be sold, packaged, etc.Now, with that out of the way, this is a film that I sincerely hope gets treated nicely when it is released on Blu-ray (and DVD).  I will say that in looking at the current specifications, I'm a bit underwhelmed and somewhat disappointed that this isn't promised as a Blu-ray and DVD combo, and also frustrated that, at least so far, it only mentions the frustrating and very disappointing UltraViolet Digital Copy.  My own preference would be for an Amazon digital copy or an iSomething digital copy that I can use on my pad or tablet device or my fruity TV player device.  UltraViolet has been a frustrating adventure indeed as the account creation/log-in requirements for the various UltraViolet partners leads to a confusing mess of code redemptions that seem to be for no purpose other than to generate statistics of customers that don't even bother to redeem these digital copies (so that the studios can cry about how people just don't want these things).Personally I like the Blu-ray/DVD combo packages since it means I can take my copies of films to my parents home to share with them without fearing that they don't yet have a Blu-ray player.  I know there are plenty of people that feel that the combo packages, as well as the digital copies, mean that these products are priced higher than they need to be and I understand the desire for single-disc movie only (""no frills"") packages that would theoretically be less expensive.  In reality though, it seems that the studios are bound and determined to put out packages that will retail at a certain price point and no amount of consumer reaction will change their minds.Anyway, let me move on to a short, but hopefully fairly well spoiler free, look at this film and get into why I rate the film as highly as I do.Over the years it seems that Hollywood could rightfully be accused of mostly ignoring and failing to target more mature (read that as code for ""older"") audiences.  For the most part, if it doesn't bleed, blow-up spectacularly, lead to uncontrollable laughter or other reactions from younger audiences then the hopes of seeing a film made and released seems to be nil.  Hollywood concentrates on creating films that appeal to the seemingly all important 18-35 year range of consumers while occasionally creating content for families with youngsters and once in a great while creating films that have appeal to more mature members of society.Older actors and actresses often lament the lack of opportunity to continue to work in the film industry, though they are sometimes offered roles as parents or senior statesmen, mentors or other similar roles in films that skew towards younger generations.  Once and in while someone comes along with a film such as this one that offers prime roles to these older and well established actors and actresses and if we're all lucky those roles are ones that offer these stars a chance to shine.Streep and Jones are certainly accomplished movie stars, each with an impressive body of work to look back on.  Having seen this film, I'd say that their performances here are every bit as good as any they've logged previously as they both make the characters they are playing here incredibly believable and incredibly sympathetic as the audience is introduced to the lives of two halves of a couple that has drifted apart over their years together.  Streep's Kay is living out her later years going through the routine that has become her life.  Jones' Arnold starts his day with the usual breakfast that Kay prepares for him and then proceeds to go to work only to come back home and eventually fall asleep in front of the TV showing the Golf Channel or an ESPN type broadcast.  Neither seems to be romantically interested in the other except for perhaps an fairly emotionless kiss before leaving for work, or... hmm, maybe Kay really is interested in more as the audience is shown Kay's nervous glances and mannerisms that show that she has something she wants to talk about with Arnold but just doesn't seem to be able to get to.  When we're shown Kay reviewing a brochure for a couples counseling/therapy series, it becomes obvious to the audience what is really on Kay's mind.These events were all ""spoiled"" for potential movie goers in the trailers and advertising leading up to the theatrical release of this film.  What wasn't spoiled was what happens when the couple inevitably goes on to the counseling with Steve Carrell's Dr. Feld (at least not terribly spoiled).  What unfolds is an incredibly believable and heart tugging look at this mature couple and the story of how they arrived at this point in their life and more importantly what they can do to get the old magic back, if that is even possible.Both Kay and Arnold react in ways that are tender, touching and sometimes outrageously funny.  Seeing the story unfold on the big screen where wife 2.0 and I enjoyed a screening with a sell-out crowd led to moments of laughter as well as the proverbial ""awwwwwww"" or other similar reactions.  Clearly all of the parties involved here, from the screen writer, the director and the actors, all cooperated nicely to produce a film that hit the right notes and should appeal to a wide range of consumers.  With that said, this film is one that likely will go ignored by much of the under 40 crowd.  They'll likely look at this as a film that their parents might enjoy, but not so much be one they'd like see, at least not until they too are balding or graying and feeling a little more mature themselves.  Sadly those that take that approach will be missing a gem of film.One final (for now, as I may come back and update this review when the Blu-ray is released and I have the copy I'm going to order in hand) note here -- this is not necessarily a film that would appeal to family viewers.  I'm not sure that I'd like to sit and watch this film with my daughter, and I'm sure that wife 2.0 wouldn't want to watch it with hers, though I suppose they might surprise me.  Sitting down as a family though, and watching it together as parents and children, would be, well, awkward.  The same could be said if I sat down to watch this with my own parents, though I did highly recommend to my own parents that they catch this film in theaters while they could (and they did, and they reported back they enjoyed it immensely).Actually one last thought here (even as I said ""one final note"" above), as I was thinking of another film that I recently enjoyed watching on Blu-ray that also involved a more mature cast.  If you are searching for something that would appeal to an more mature audience, then give serious consideration toThe Best Exotic Marigold Hotel [Blu-ray].  It is definitely worth the viewing, just as Hope Springs was.",5,"Review of the film, not the Blu-ray or DVD",1350432000,"10 17, 2012",2012,7341,"['Amazon', 'usual', 'tricks', 'reviews', 'item',

This is what a movie is supposed to do. It was refreshing to witness actors, director, and screen writer all come together in a professional manner.

These guys made it look easy.Arnold (Tommy Lee Jones) and Kay (Meryl Streep) have been married for 31 years. They are in a routine which most of us call ""a rut."" Kay opts to save the marriage, one that Arnold is unaware is in trouble, by going to a marriage counselor played by an unfunny Steven Carrell. Arnold hates the idea, and reluctantly goes with.The movie takes place in the quaint Maine coastal town of Norwalk, Conn. It is a feel good movie that has its ups and downs. The comedy, plot, and drama are light in order to generate a feeling. The film was done extremely well, one that I would say was worthy of Oscar nomination, but not necessarily winning. I will also add, it really wasn't my cup of tea, but I can't fault the film.

Dissatisfied (sexually, I mean) with her life, Kay buys a book written by a marriage expert Dr. Feld (Steve Carell), signs up for an intensive one-week marriage counseling session with the doctor, and travels to Great Hope Springs, Maine, with her reluctant husband, who would rather be watching golf on TV.""Hope Springs"" is often referred to as a romantic comedy, but I think, to most viewers, the film looks more like a filmic adaptation of a serious stage drama. During the session Dr. Feld calmly asks Kay and Arnold most embarrassing questions. Don't expect anything overtly comedic here. Steve Carell delivers a muted, low-key performance, bringing little to the role. Blink your eyes and you will miss Elisabeth Shue. The film's focus is always on Kay and Arnold Soames, struggling to keep the marriage going.The best part of the film is cast-against-type Tommy Lee Jones and his fine performance. Were it not for the final ten minutes (together with the end credits that are certainly amusing), I would give the film three stars or even more.

1587399,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0099114WO,Turfseer,"[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0I had high hopes for 'Hope Springs' and was not disappointed, as it was directed by David Frankel, responsible for the excellent 'Devil Wears Prada'. How can you go wrong with icons such as Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones who have great chemistry together as Kay and Arnold Soames, a middle-aged couple, who have lost the spark in their marriage?The film proceeds methodically and with great subtlety as the stultifying relationship between the couple is stripped away during marriage counseling sessions with Dr. Bernie Feld (here Steve Carell does an excellent job playing a 'straight man', in a rare non-comedy role).When we're first introduced to the 'ordinary world' of Kay and Arnold, most people who have been married for a long time, will see quite a bit of themselves in this relationship. Arnold (a partner in an Omaha accounting firm) has alienated his wife through his curmudgeonly ways--watching golf on TV all the time and showing her zero affection. The most exciting thing that Kay reveals to her adult children, who are visiting for the holidays, is that they've just purchased a new cable TV subscription.The inciting incident occurs when Kay dips into her savings and purchases a one week getaway in Maine, to see Dr. Feld for ""intense"" marriage counseling. Arnold thinks it's a ridiculous idea and Kay announces she's going anyway, whether Arnold decides to go or not. The fact that Arnold joins her on the trip despite his earlier opposition, is significant, as it indicates that he's not completely hopeless.As we break into Act II, Kay and Arnold begin having counseling sessions with Dr. Feld. Arnold's resistance to therapy is quite strong in the beginning but they do have a breakthrough when they're able to hug one another in bed (this is Dr. Feld's 'sexercise #1'). The stakes are raised when he begins asking pointed questions about their sex life. Kay is so inhibited that she admits that she's had no sexual fantasies during the life of their marriage. The minor 'victory' of cuddling in bed is short-lived, as we arrive at the 'mid-point' with Arnold storming out of a session after he fails to take responsibility for sabotaging Dr. Feld's 'Sexercise #2' (touching one another sexually, in bed).What Arnold actually doesn't like is being exposed as a hypocrite, self-righteously asserting that he made all these sacrifices for Kay (such as never cheating on her, as this was some kind of badge of honor). In reality, he can't own up to the fact that he's withdrawn all affection for his wife and almost has completely sabotaged their relationship.The second half of Act II, reveals a series of obstacles that crop up, seemingly preventing the couple from achieving intimacy. First is the frank discussion that Kay and Arnold have about what they don't like about one another. Dr. Feld then asks them to have an intimate encounter in a public place (his request ends disastrously as Kay tries to give Arnold oral sex, in a movie theater).Finally, the therapy appears to be working, as Arnold's attitude appears to be changing. He manages to book dinner and an overnight stay at a fancy inn/restaurant in town (instead of the Econolodge, where they've been staying outside, on the outskirts of town). They both drink and retire to the bedroom, where they begin to make love. The second act crisis is brilliantly depicted, as Arnold won't look in Kay's eyes while about to make love, and appears to abandon interest. Kay is shattered over Arnold's indifference, which she believed, he had overcome.Dr. Feld likens the failure to consummate, like ""fumbling"" on the first yard line. He argues that when they first came in, they were merely in the parking lot, before going into the stadium. But Feld's words are of little consolation to the couple, especially Kay, who believes her goal to re-establish intimacy, has failed.But Dr. Feld was right all along. When you strip everything away, and the true emotions rise to the surface, eventually the damage will be repaired. So Arnold finally does have an epiphany and returns to the bedroom with Kay. The 'coda' at the end, where the couple renews their vows, is tantamount to the knight reclaiming a lost sword, after a mythic 'trial by fire' journey.Kay and Arnold are generic characters, and we only get to see a little of their back stories during the film. This isn't important, since we should be more interested in viewing the dissection of their relationship, through the film's narrative. One could argue that the film's scenarist, could have done more with the Dr. Feld character, as he seems to be too much of a 'perfect' therapist, but I'm sure there are those couples out there, who have undergone this kind of therapy, who will swear by therapists such as Dr. Feld.'Hope Springs' is more dialogue based, than an image based film. But due to the riveting performances of the principals, one's interest remains riveted throughout the film. For those who wish to be emotionally uplifted, 'Hope Springs' is for you.",4,"Streep and Jones have perfect chemistry in this excellent, emotionally satisfying distillation of a middle-aged couple in
