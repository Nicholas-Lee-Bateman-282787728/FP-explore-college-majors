Repressed and bored, she's the long-suffering wife of a mental hospital's deputy director, Max Raphael (Hugh Bonneville). It's the late 1950s, and Stella's marriage to Max is a case study in dreariness and boredom. A puritanical psychiatrist, Max treats Stella like she's an undeserving servant, an excess piece of baggage there to fulfill Max's own whims.Max has just landed an apparently cushy job at a British asylum outside London, and he expects Stella to not only fit in with all the other psychiatrist wives, but also do her best to make sure that his tenure at the hospital is made permanent. Their young son Charlie (Gus Lewis) gives Stella much pleasure, but there's still something missing in her life; it's just not enough to spend her days planning parties for the inmates and gossiping with her colleagues.Her redeemer comes in the form of the enigmatic loony hunk Edgar (Marton Csokas), a sexy, handsome, brooding brute of a sculptor who once decapitated his wife for seeing other men. At first, Edgar helps Stella in her household chores, and becomes a playmate to young Charlie, but before long Stella is putting fresh lipstick on, swigging back the scotch for courage, and searching Edgar out for afternoon trysts in the rundown green house with hospital guards or family only scant hidden yards away.The physical encounters are raw and sexual, with both of them unleashing all their bottled up frustrations and desires. Soon they are falling in love, both perhaps unaware that the affair can lead nowhere. Their fanatical obsession for one another soon gets the better of them, with Stella contemplating leaving her husband and child, while Edgar manages to escape, seeking refuge in the back alleyways of London.Director, David MacKenzie follows Edgar and Stella as they progress in their affair that is so unlikely, but so well executed that it defies disbelief. Stella is formidably determined to attach herself to Edgar even though it means the end of her marriage, her relationship with her son, and her middle-class privileged life. But her nemesis ultimately comes in the form of Peter Cleave (Ian McKellan) a callous, snooping, and cleverly manipulative hospital administrator, who's on to Stella's affair with Edgar.Stella's grim resolve to hook up with Edgar always seems to manifest itself at the wrong time and usually with the worse results, as she consciously embarks on a path of self destruction. Edgar is bad news, and Peter Cleave warns her about his penchant for violence, but there's little Stella can do to stop her runaway desires for him. She's not an evil person, like the psychopathic Edgar, but her fate ends up being intertwined with the patient rather than Max, who later on reveals that he is not such a bad husband after all.It is mostly the lovely Natasha Richardson who holds this movie together, as she tries in vein to be the dutiful wife, making a concerted effort to fit in, trying to extract a like-minded conformity, when all she really wants to do is cut loose and act out her inner sexual fantasies, involving sordid quickies with her new found love on the floor amongst the broken glass of the tumbling down hot house.Based on the book by Patrick McGrath, the film is well acted - particularly by the hunky Csokas, as the brooding and virile Edgar - and it's tightly directed, but it doesn't totally capture the furtive and darkly psychological nature of its source material. Whilst the film is no doubt compelling, and some of it is down right hot, the lust is sometimes overwrought and the passion dynamics often contrived and it all ends up coming across as something resembling psychosexual Harlequin romance, It's like an entertaining and darkly ironic potboiler melodrama, with a lunatic hunk at its center.

945860,AORW1FRF4D4KS,B000BNX4MW,azindn,"[0, 0]","Asylum brings obsession, sex, and passion into perspective and in and out of marriage in this film with beautiful Natasha Richardson, Ian McKellen, and a cast of veteran British character actors whose fine performances bring depth and pathos to a story of insanity and love. Who are the patients and who are the caregivers is questionable in the setting of a rural hospital for the criminally insane. There, an ambitious new head, Dr. Raphael (Hugh Bonneville) arrives with his stunning but distant, bored wife, Stella (Natasha Richardson), and their young son, Charley. They are surrounded by patients whose regulated existence is mirrored in the conservative views and practices of the medical staff and their middle class wives. She is warned by her husband to fit in, a threat more than a request.Richardson's character, Stella Raphael meets Dr. Cleve (McKellen), a bachelor administrator who has been passed over for the job her husband holds after years of loyal service. His resentment and contrivances are the gist of this storyline but recognized only in hindsight. Cleve tells Stella at their first meeting that his specialty are sexual cases in which passions not his can be observed (and manipulated). His pet patient is a handsome artist who in a fit of jealousy murdered his wife. Cleve allows the artist to be a laborer in the backyard conservatory of Stella's home where she is easily drawn to him and seduced.Their passionate trysts take over their daily routine and the hospital gossip begins. Stella's husband is too submerged in work and fitting in with the surroundings to notice his wife's obsession. The obsessive sexual attachment of Stella and the artist result in his eventual escape from the hospital with her following him and the expected disastrous results that verge on the Greek tragedy scale. In the second half of the film, unexpected twists and turns brings all the men of Stella's life in direct conflict and collision.The mature storyline is filled with vibrant scenery and grittiness in sets reflecting beautiful cinematography. Each actor is subtle and never over the top that brings the unexpected to a satisfying ending without drawing overt conclusions for the audience. It is another small and quiet British film which they excel in producing.

(WARNING - there are spoilers ahead!)Csokas' character Cleave is so one dimensional, so uninteresting, and so wooden you wonder what richarson's Stella ever sees in him.  OK - there is an underlying Russell Crowe/Brendon Frazier primal urgency that may have interested her at first.  But the man is a bore.  Worse, he's an obvious true lunatic who is said to have murdered his wife, decapitated her, scalped her, then hacked at her face like the clay he feebly molds as a failed artist.  Even if Stella had volcanic orgasms with this guy, wouldn't she have been a bit more apprehensive about continuing, and renewing, this relationship over and over and over again?Ian McKellen remains a joy to watch.  His well contained performance is all in his eyes. A performance that begs us to question the line between neurosis and true insanity.Ultimately the film is unsatisfying. Stella is so wretched - ultimately spacing out while watching her son drown leading to his death - viewers can only feel relief when she falls to her ultimate Hitchcockian vertiginous doom. Even here, we're reminded of what the master director knew; there is more to fear in what is unseen, rather than what is actually seen.Though we get to watch Edgar pummel her, at least we're spared the indignity of watching him hack her to pieces.Worth the 3.50 it's selling for on Amazon.

945865,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BNX4MW,Grady Harp,"[5, 5]","Patrick McGrath's novel 'Asylum' was more a poetic elegy about thwarted love and lust than the screenplay by Patrick Marber ('Closer') addresses.  The improbability of the story, when McGrath's poetic prose is extracted, surfaces and the nuances of a dark love story are lessened.  Despite this the film is a worthy, strange story with a fine cast lending lustre to it.The time is the 1950s, and the place is a mental institution in the outskirts of London where Max Raphael (Hugh Bonneville) brings his wife Stella (Natasha Richardson) and young son Charlie (Gus Lewis) to begin his tenure as a psychologist.  The asylum is dark, dank, and foreboding, a place where the wives of the doctors are expected to behave and be bored at silly conclaves and teas, all lead by the director Jack (Joss Ackland) and his stuffy wife Bridie (Wanda Ventham).  The sinister Dr. Peter Cleave (Ian McKellen) observes the new couple with suspicion, as they are his 'competition' in the ascendancy of director.  Peter is coldly genial and concerns himself only with his 'pet patient' Edgar (Marton Csokas), a handsome but dark sculptor who is institutionalized for brutally murdering and dismembering his wife and for whom Peter appears to have a sexual attraction.In no time Stella is bored, not even able to assist her maid Mrs. Rose (Sara Thurston) in household chores. Stella sees Edgar and an attraction is mutually palpable, and soon enough they begin acting out their frustrated prolonged lust in the greenhouse Edgar is renovating.  Peter and the other staff expect the affair, but when circumstances surface Max's ready embarrassment at his wife's behavior explodes.  Edgar escapes the asylum to live with his old friend Nick (Sean Harris) and before long Stella discovers his whereabouts in London and begins assignations there under the guise of shopping trips. Ultimately she responds to Edgar's demands to leave her family and live with him, all the while watching Edgar plunge into the same mental state that preceded the murder of his wife.  Peter relentlessly seeks out the couple, finds them and returns Stella to her husband who has been fired from his job because of her dalliances.  They move to North Wales to a meager life, Edgar follows, and before long the couple reunites with disastrous results.  Stella's mind is broken and she tacitly sits and watches her son drown, and as a result she is returned to the asylum as a patient.  The ending is bleak and somewhat unexpected and ties the story of love abnormally focused to a circular closure.Filmed in atmospheric dark tones by cinematographer Giles Nuttgens the story's mood remains grim.  The cast is excellent with most of the honors going to Ian McKellen in one of his usual highly nuanced performances.  Natasha Richardson is believable as the tortured Stella and Hugh Bonneville is aptly cold and distant.  Marton Csokas finds the dark interior of Edgar and is understandably the source of attraction for both Stella and Peter. The director David Mackenzie ('Young Adam') needed to pay more attention to the editing, a problem that makes this tale of downfall choppy and disjointed.  Otherwise 'Asylum' is a suspenseful, tragic story of the asylums people create for themselves. But oh, for the poetry of Patrick McGrath... Recommended.

Davis ""Jeffrey Matthew Davis""","[7, 18]","Well, the summer movie season is definately on, which means there are lots of lackluster blockbusters and--for those of us that prefer something a bit more intellectual--independant films.  ""Asylum""--which stars Natasha Richardson as a woman who leaves her phycho-therapist husband for a mental patient and then goes insane herself and Ian McKellen as her lover's doctor--has all the pretentiousness of an intellectual, entertaining independant film but fails to live up to expectations.""Asylum,"" or as I call it ""This Summer's Swimming Pool,"" has all the elements that a good film should have.  It has a story about adultery, violence, and insanity, three elements which left alone could create a compelling story and thrown together should be absolutely riviting.  The film also features a stellar cast and a noteworthy screenwriter, Patrick Marber, famed for writing the stage and screen versions of ""Closer,"" another film I felt particularly raped out of ten dollars by.  In all fairness, I saw ""Asylum"" at a free sneek-preview show and also had a complimentary glass of wine beforehand, so the experience wasn't a total waste of time or money.The main problems in ""Asylum"" come from poor writing and directing.  Some of the lines in the film were so poorly written and cheesy that the entire audience was laughing hysterically at certain points; definately not the desired reaction to a dramatic piece.  Other scenes seemed barely stitched together or crafted.  For example, after building the tension between the woman and the inmate she eventually falls for, the director totally lost all energy and chemestry between them during their first sex scene.  The lovemaking between the characters lasted a dismal minute and a half, making me and half the audience laugh.  A ninety-year-old man could last longer than that, and if the writer or director doubt that they could have asked Ian McKellen as he was on set.In short, if you're in the mood for a good independant film, I hear ""My Date With Drew"" and ""March of the Penguins"" are quite good.

From ""Basic Instinct"" to ""The Lover"", these movies really intrigue me.This movie was  directed by David Mackenize who also directed the overrated ""Young Adam"" which was cold and boring. ""Asylum"" on the other hand is a better achievement by the director. One of the factors that can add to the excitement and tension of the adulterous affair is the danger of being caught. Add to that, the fierce and idiosyncratic passion often attributed to artists. Then make the artist a raving psychopath and you have a pretty heady mix.So finds the story of Asylum, your place into a world of sexual obsession, violence and madness. Stella (Natasha Richardson) is wearily married to Max (Hugh Bonneville), a psychiatrist working in a 1950s hospital for the criminally insane. He is overbearing to the point of being monstrous (by modern standards), joking to her about her being his 'pet patient' whilst expecting her to be a no-brainer wife who says the right things when introduced socially. In the initial build up, Mackenzie let's us see the smouldering lust in the face of inmate Edgar, who's incarcerated for murdering and decapitating his wife in a jealous rage. Just as he did with his previous movie, ""Young Adam,"" Mackenzie excels at portraying barely sublimated animal sensuality, which soon bursts across the screen in a way that is at once base and beautiful. Helen knows how insane Edgar is, and her feelings for him, but she is gradually drawn into his web of madness, together with her son.""Asylum"" is visually appealing with it's dank, grey tones This film has it's explosions of repressed sexuality that is frightening in its force and surprising in its ending. Scenes of violence and sexuality make ""Asylum"" a film not for everyone.

It was easily one of the best films of that year; I became a Patrick McGrath fan shortly thereafter. I only read ""Spider"" though and had two other novels that I had never read ""Dr. Haggards Disease"" and ""Asylum"". One day, while looking through Hollywood Video I saw this movie and knew it was the film adaptation of the novel right away. Now, I still have never read the book so this review is based solely on the film. It really doesn't hold up to ""Spider"". The performances are top notch and I love the cinematography (especially during the suicide scene) and it's not a bad movie...It's just that it lacks the mystery, suspense, and spooky atmosphere that ""Spider"" had. Maybe if I wasn't comparing this to that I would've liked this movie quite a bit more...But frankly, this movie is a C movie and is only getting a B from me due to the powerful ending. The movie is about Stella (Natasha Richardson) who's husband Max Raphael is the newly appointed Deputy Superintendent of a maxium security asylum. Not very far from the asylum lives Stella and her family (including her son Charlie) and one of the patients Edgar Stark (Marton Csokas) begins working on their run down greenhouse. Stella and Edgar are attracted to each other, oddly enough and begin an affair, but to top that off...Edgar is in the asylum for the murder of his wife. Ian McKellen (The Lord of the Rings, X-Men) is great in his role as Peter Cleave, Edgar's doctor who spends the movie keeping Stella and Edgar apart. Now, this movie isn't spectacular by any means. It's not one of the best films of the year, but it does tell an interesting story.

Unfortunately, the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms... a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession.The basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist's wife (an excellent Natasha Richardson) and one of the asylum's patients (an equally good Marton Csokas), under the watchful eye of the patient's doctor (Ian McKellen).  There are several plot twists in the last part of the movie, some of which seem quite preposterous, at least in the way the movie was shot.The only reason to watch this movie is to see Natasha Richardson.  She does her best in spite of the choppy script, and she even won a Best Actress award in London for this film.  However, as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession, director David Mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job.

He is accompanied by his wife, Stella (Natasha Richardson), and their young son, Charlie (Gus Lewis), with the family living on the grounds.  The family is greeted by Peter Cleave (Ian McKellen), who has been at this place for a long time, quite possibly since the days of good old Queen Victoria, and he expected to be given the administrative position.  Now he is relegated to being Max's chief assistant, and when Max makes a point of remind Peter, ""I am your superior,"" Peter responds by asking ""In what sense?""  The remark is uttered with a charming smile, but there is such an underlying threat behind it that you immediately think of the spider and the fly.One of Peter's patients is Edgar Stark (Marton Csokas), who is assigned the task of rebuilding a gardener's shed that Stella wants to use.  When Charlie, desperate for attention and some form of friendship, develops a relationship with Edgar, which has Stella concerned.  When something happens to Charlie, she assumes Edgar is responsible, and when that turns out not to be the case, her feelings for Edgar turn into something else.  The next thing we know, every opportunity she can find, Stella is stealing away to the shed for bouts of intense sex with Edgar.  Stella never articulates her reasoning for this affair and we are left to piece together our own thoughts by looking at her relationships with her husband and son, the life she is forced to live at the asylum, and the mysterious stranger who wants her.  Even when she finds out why he is in the asylum, it does not matter because her obsession is complete.""Asylum"" is not a love story, but rather a descent into Hell, and we can take comfort in knowing that Stella is beyond the pale so that we do not have to bring the grace of God into the equation.  At some point it will be clear to you that Stella's character has no desire for redemption and you may well decide she does not deserve it anyway.  Plus there is the question of how much Cleave is responsible for what happens.  From the start of this 2005 film I was nervous about what McKellan's character was up to, and while I think he would claim more credit for events than is his due, I do not for a second believe his hands are clean.  But this is really clearly Richardson's film, and I swear that she says virtually nothing in scene after scene.  Every pivotal moment for her character is a look rather than a line of dialogue, because what she does from start to finish is more revealing than anything she ever says, and while we are riveted by the performance.",4,Natasha Richardson portrays the psychology of personal destruction,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",2006,2800,"['1960s', 'Max', 'Raphael', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'director', 'English', 'asylum', 'Victorian', 'era', 'peculiar', 'combination', 'lavish', 'grounds', 'dungeons', 'reflected', 'evolving', 'sensibilities', 'mentally', 'ill', 'accompanied', 'wife', 'Stella', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'young', 'son', 'Charlie', 'Gus', 'Lewis', 'family', 'living', 'grounds', 'family', 'greeted', 'Peter', 'Cleave', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'who', 'been', 'place', 'long', 'time', 'quite', 'possibly', 'days', 'good', 'old', 'Queen', 'Victoria', 'expected', 'be', 'given', 'administrative', 'position', 'Now', 'relegated', 'being', 'Max', 'chief', 'assistant', 'when', 'Max', 'point', 'remind', 'Peter', 'am', 'superior', 'Peter', 'responds', 'asking', 'what', 'sense', 'remark', 'uttered', 'charming', 'smile', 'such', 'underlying', 'threat', 'immediately', 'think', 'spider', 'fly.One', 'Peter', 'patients', 'Edgar', 'Stark', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'who', 'assigned', 'task', 'rebuilding', 'gardener', 'shed', 'Stella', 'use', 'When', 'Charlie', 'desperate', 'attention', 'form', 'friendship', 'relationship', 'Edgar', 'Stella', 'concerned', 'When', 'something', 'Charlie', 'Edgar', 'responsible', 'when', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'feelings', 'Edgar', 'turn', 'something', 'else', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'opportunity', 'can', 'find', 'Stella', 'stealing', 'away', 'shed', 'bouts', 'intense', 'sex', 'Edgar', 'Stella', 'never', 'reasoning', 'affair', 'are', 'left', 'piece', 'together', 'own', 'thoughts', 'looking', 'relationships', 'husband', 'son', 'life', 'forced', 'live', 'asylum', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'who', 'Even', 'when', 'out', 'why', 'asylum', 'not', 'matter', 'obsession', 'complete', 'Asylum', 'not', 'love', 'story', 'rather', 'descent', 'Hell', 'can', 'take', 'comfort', 'knowing', 'Stella', 'pale', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'bring', 'grace', 'God', 'equation', 'point', 'will', 'be', 'clear', 'Stella', 'character', 'desire', 'redemption', 'may', 'well', 'decide', 'not', 'deserve', 'anyway', 'question', 'how', 'much', 'Cleave', 'responsible', 'what', 'start', '2005', 'film', 'was', 'nervous', 'what', 'McKellan', 'character', 'was', 'up', 'think', 'would', 'claim', 'more', 'credit', 'events', 'due', 'do', 'not', 'second', 'believe', 'hands', 'are', 'clean', 'really', 'clearly', 'Richardson', 'film', 'swear', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'scene', 'scene', 'Every', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'character', 'look', 'rather', 'line', 'dialogue', 'what', 'start', 'finish', 'more', 'revealing', 'anything', 'ever', 'are', 'riveted', 'performance']",Asylum

Unfortunately, he plays a career-obssessed prig unable to understand or satisfy his wife (Natasha Richardson), so there's not a lot for him to do other than evidence stick-up-your-bum British reserve.  When the film starts, with Bonneville taking a new, live-in position at an asylum for the criminally insane, thing are already icy between him and Richardson, so it's difficult to know how their relationship went south or why, other than the fact that they have a typically charming English schoolboy son, they have stayed together.  Richardson leaps so quickly into a passionate affair with a homicidal inmate that it's difficult not to see her as in serious need of psychiatric intervention herself (yes, he's good looking and yes, he apparently became visibly aroused when they danced together at an institute function, but Richardson's character would have seemed more believable, not to mention sympathetic, had it taken her awhile to be drawn into the relationship). After a number of highly erotic interactions in a greenhouse (in what seems to be full view of other inmates working nearby ... apparently Richardson and the inmate like risky sex), the film devolves predictably ... they get caught, he escapes, she goes to him ... and then reaches its aesthetic and emotional nadir in a brutal scene in which the inmate brutally beats Richardson, including a direct punch in the face that is one of the most startling depictions of violence against a woman I've ever seen on screen.

Last night we watched one with that name from 2005 starring Natasha Richardson and Ian McKellen. It was listed as a 'Horror' film at Amazon Prime Videos and had a high rating.  I would consider it more a steamy psychological drama than horror.  As might be expected by the names involved it was well acted.  The settings and visuals were well done too.  The first one third of the film was promising.  It's the story of a psychiatrist named Max that comes to work in a new position at large asylum for the mentally disturbed including the criminally insane.  He brings along his seemingly bored wife Stella (played by the late Natasha Richardson) and young son. Ian McKellen plays Dr. Cleave, a long time doctor there that felt he deserved the position that Max was given. The wife (Natasha Richardson) soon falls for one of the inmates, Edgar.  Edgar is a man who was found guilty in the murder and disfigurement of his former wife. Yes, what woman could resist such a tempting bad boy like Edgar, geesh.  Soon Stella and Edgar begin an unlikely steamy love affair right under the nose of her husband, the guards and everyone else at the Asylum.  This place has some security. They have steamy love making encounters right on the asylum grounds in places where he is doing jobs as a trusted inmate.  Sometimes they just miss being caught on the grounds by a guard coming to check on him.  It all becomes rather laughable the chances the wife takes.  Still the first third of the film is intriguing and makes you wonder where it will all lead. Is Ian McKellen's character some how a part of all this? What part does he play in what's to come? Unfortunately the story soon turns into one where you do not care about a single character in the film with the exception of the little boy.  The inmate soon easily escapes when he realizes he will not be released anytime in the near future.  The wife finds shopping excursion excuses to go weekly into the city where she joins him at his hide out.  Eventually Stella leaves her husband to be with Edgar, even though he is now jealous of her talking to other men and beats her regularly.  The story goes even further downhill from there dragging on with more depressing and irritating developments.  Finally at the depressing end we found ourselves asking ourselves why they turned such a promising drama into such a total mess.  Don't bother watching this film unless you like depressing pointless movies with characters you eventually don't care about.

Whereas the Pinter film only really had 3 characters however, this has 6, all wonderfully drawn and beautifully acted. It is an actor's movie, if ever there was one. Most fascinating and yes, creepy is the Ian McKellen role, as the ambitious mental hospital director who himself has a secret obsession with the doctor's wife ( Natasha Richardson).

It knocks anything in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" into a cocked hat.In a market awash with third rate comedy this drama has all the hallmarks of classic tragedy with no-one emerging from a terrible chain of events unscathed. In spite of this one never loses sympathy for any of the characters and indeed feels great pity for most, even McKellen. Nothing in this film is flashy.

But their attempted escape from the asylum is largely insuccessful as the strict order of the loveless world around them always tries to tie them down and their degressive control over their own emotions severs the bonds between them.So basically we have a story about love that turns into obsession that turns, literally, into insanity, a theme I am quite intrigued with and that was explored certainly to surprising degrees here.  The movie wastes no time in foreshadowing all the events that will happen, along with making quite clear in the first few moments of screentime that yes, in fact, Stella is a de facto inmate of the asylum.  So while it wouldn't necessarily be subtle--in fact seeming to race ahead at moments when one expects the exposition to be more gradual--it still contains a vested interest in showing just how hard it can be sometimes to separate desire from insanity.And maybe, to a degree, it's so blatantly three-act, and follows a sense of rigid literature that it is somewhat cliched in its structure, but for that it can still be enjoyed as a theatre, to sit back and focus more on the acting and just how the story progresses, not where it's going to progress which should be quite obvious to any viewer from the beginning.--PolarisDiB",4,Love-->obsession-->insanity,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,1571,"['Two', 'people', 'are', 'caught', 'British', 'insane', 'asylum', 'woman', 'who', 'married', 'one', 'doctors', 'patient', 'who', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'wife', 'two', 'once', 'finding', 'other', 'are', 'instantly', 'attracted', 'other', 'begin', 'obsess', 'other', 'escape', 'following', 'attempted', 'escape', 'asylum', 'largely', 'insuccessful', 'strict', 'order', 'loveless', 'world', 'always', 'tie', 'down', 'degressive', 'control', 'own', 'emotions', 'bonds', 'them.So', 'basically', 'have', 'story', 'love', 'obsession', 'literally', 'insanity', 'theme', 'am', 'quite', 'intrigued', 'was', 'explored', 'certainly', 'surprising', 'degrees', 'here', 'movie', 'time', 'foreshadowing', 'events', 'will', 'happen', 'making', 'quite', 'clear', 'first', 'few', 'moments', 'screentime', 'yes', 'fact', 'Stella', 'de', 'facto', 'inmate', 'asylum', 'So', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'be', 'subtle', 'fact', 'seeming', 'race', 'ahead', 'moments', 'when', 'one', 'exposition', 'be', 'more', 'gradual', 'still', 'vested', 'interest', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'hard', 'can', 'be', 'sometimes', 'separate', 'desire', 'insanity.And', 'maybe', 'degree', 'so', 'blatantly', 'three-act', 'sense', 'rigid', 'literature', 'somewhat', 'cliched', 'structure', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'theatre', 'sit', 'back', 'focus', 'more', 'acting', 'just', 'how', 'story', 'not', 'where', 'going', 'progress', 'should', 'be', 'quite', 'obvious', 'viewer', 'beginning.', 'PolarisDiB']",Asylum

Stella is a beautiful woman, living in depressing and a boring marriage to her psychiatist husband.  She is isolated and lonely and her only preoccupation in life is her young son.  But there is a desire for Stella to feel happy, elated, excited and wanted.  She finds it with a mental patient at the hospital where her husband works.  The sexual tension between the two is instanteous.  The fact that the young man is an artist (sculptor) invokes notions of deep romantic emotional attachment she hopes to attain.  Their secret love making in the glass garden house, makes their affair irresistible to her.  But the young patient is morbidly jealous that makes him unable to control himself and function normally in any relationship.  The hights and lows of their relationship are destructive to them and all around them.  As we watch this story unfold with all of its unfortunate turns of events, one almost feels sorry for the woman that men see as a possesion to be paraded around, or stored away safely, when all she really needs is attention,love and passion.

945899,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000BNX4MW,Z Hayes,"[1, 2]","""Asylum"" is based on the novel by Patrick McGrath, and is a very dark movie exploring human frailties, especially when people are driven by boredom and lust. The main character here is Stella Raphael (Natasha Richardson delivering a stellar performance). Stella is a repressed housewife married to up-and-coming psychiatrist Max (Hugh Bonneville, one of my favorite period drama actors) who has recently been appointed to an important position at a lunatic asylum. Max and Stella's marriage is stale and way past its expiration date. Though they both dote on their only child, Charlie, the couple's relationship suffers from a lack of passion, and Max is too ambitious and buried in his work to pay much attention to Stella, though he demands that she help him socially by playing the devoted wife and taking an interest in the women's committee. Max claims all psychiatrists have their ""pet patients"" and when Stella asks Max if he has one, he says ""it's you"". Clearly, this is a deeply troubled marriage.It is no wonder then that Stella's attentions begin to roam, especially when she encounters one of the asylum's inmates working on a glass house on their property. Edgar (Marton Csokas) gives Stella brooding, lusty looks, and though the man appears to be fairly sane, he also gives the impression that he could snap at any moment. Turns out Edgar is Peter Cleave's (Ian McKellen playing Raphael's rival at the asylum) ""pet patient"", who though aware of Edgar's perilous mental health (Edgar apparently hammered his wife to death in a fit of jealous rage), thinks he is safe enough to be out working among normal humans. Cleave is the true antagonist here - he himself harbors some secret desires for the lovely Stella, yet exhibits voyeuristic tendencies by watching and enabling Edgar and Stella's coupling. The couple engages in illicit sex anywhere and whenever they can, sometimes defying credulity as there's a guard posted close to Edgar (who conveniently disappears whenever Stella comes to pay Edgar a visit!). The sex is hot, rough, and wanton, and both cannot get enough of each other. Eventually, Edgar finds a means of escaping the asylum, and Stella is distraught beyond belief. When the pair eventually meet up in London, they resume their affair, and events spiral downwards very quickly with calamitous consequences for many individuals.Watching this movie is like watching a train wreck. One senses that the main characters are heading toward disaster, yet the plot moves in such a way that the viewer cannot help but be pulled into the story, knowing that this is not going to end well. All the main actors - Csokas as the severely disturbed Edgar, McKellen as the devious, manipulative Cleave, Bonneville as the indifferent husband, and of course Richardson as the tortured Stella play their roles with a high level of credibility. Some parts of the story don't flow very well, but the overall execution is well done.Be warned - this is a sensuous yet very dark movie, and exposes human frailties in a raw manner that is uncomfortable to watch, yet engages one's attention.",4,Compelling and dark psychological drama,1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,3098,"['Asylum', 'based', 'novel', 'Patrick', 'McGrath', 'very', 'dark', 'movie', 'exploring', 'human', 'frailties', 'especially', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'driven', 'boredom', 'lust', 'main', 'character', 'here', 'Stella', 'Raphael', 'Natasha', 'Richardson', 'delivering', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Stella', 'repressed', 'housewife', 'married', 'up-and-coming', 'psychiatrist', 'Max', 'Hugh', 'Bonneville', 'one', 'favorite', 'period', 'drama', 'actors', 'who', 'recently', 'been', 'appointed', 'important', 'position', 'lunatic', 'asylum', 'Max', 'Stella', 'marriage', 'stale', 'way', 'expiration', 'date', 'dote', 'only', 'child', 'Charlie', 'couple', 'relationship', 'suffers', 'lack', 'passion', 'Max', 'too', 'ambitious', 'buried', 'work', 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'Stella', 'help', 'socially', 'playing', 'devoted', 'wife', 'taking', 'interest', 'women', 'committee', 'Max', 'psychiatrists', 'have', 'pet', 'patients', 'when', 'Stella', 'Max', 'one', 'Clearly', 'deeply', 'troubled', 'marriage.It', 'wonder', 'then', 'Stella', 'attentions', 'begin', 'roam', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'asylum', 'inmates', 'working', 'glass', 'house', 'property', 'Edgar', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'Stella', 'brooding', 'lusty', 'looks', 'man', 'be', 'fairly', 'sane', 'also', 'impression', 'could', 'snap', 'moment', 'out', 'Edgar', 'Peter', 'Cleave', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'playing', 'Raphael', 'rival', 'asylum', 'pet', 'patient', 'who', 'aware', 'Edgar', 'perilous', 'mental', 'health', 'Edgar', 'apparently', 'hammered', 'wife', 'death', 'fit', 'jealous', 'rage', 'safe', 'enough', 'be', 'out', 'working', 'normal', 'humans', 'Cleave', 'true', 'antagonist', 'here', 'secret', 'desires', 'lovely', 'Stella', 'yet', 'voyeuristic', 'tendencies', 'watching', 'enabling', 'Edgar', 'Stella', 'coupling', 'couple', 'illicit', 'sex', 'anywhere', 'whenever', 'can', 'sometimes', 'defying', 'credulity', 'guard', 'posted', 'close', 'Edgar', 'who', 'conveniently', 'whenever', 'Stella', 'pay', 'Edgar', 'visit', 'sex', 'hot', 'rough', 'wanton', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'other', 'Eventually', 'Edgar', 'means', 'escaping', 'asylum', 'Stella', 'distraught', 'belief', 'When', 'pair', 'eventually', 'meet', 'up', 'London', 'resume', 'affair', 'events', 'spiral', 'downwards', 'very', 'quickly', 'calamitous', 'consequences', 'many', 'individuals.Watching', 'movie', 'watching', 'train', 'wreck', 'One', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'heading', 'disaster', 'plot', 'moves', 'such', 'way', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'pulled', 'story', 'knowing', 'not', 'going', 'end', 'well', 'main', 'actors', 'Csokas', 'severely', 'disturbed', 'Edgar', 'McKellen', 'devious', 'manipulative', 'Cleave', 'Bonneville', 'indifferent', 'husband', 'course', 'Richardson', 'tortured', 'Stella', 'play', 'roles', 'high', 'level', 'credibility', 'parts', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'flow', 'very', 'well', 'overall', 'execution', 'well', 'done.Be', 'warned', 'sensuous', 'yet', 'very', 'dark', 'movie', 'human', 'frailties', 'raw', 'manner', 'uncomfortable', 'watch', 'one', 'attention']",Asylum
