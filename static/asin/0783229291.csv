61453,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,0783229291,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[2, 2]","As my title says, I can't help but wonder why I did not buy this film sooner. Balto is a fantastic and excellent piece of animated film-making. Too bad critics didn't seem to think like just about everyone who saw this film (45% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes...WHAT THE HELL?! You people think trash like Madagascar deserves better ratings? What is wrong with you people?). But then again, I stopped trusting them once I saw they also trashed All Dogs Go To Heaven. Balto is a wonderful and thrilling adventure that just about anyone can enjoy, and it's no wonder this film has such a large fanbase, and now I'm a part of it.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: 1925, Nome, Alaska. Our hero Balto is a half-breed who is part wolf and part husky, which is why just about everyone in the town treats him like crap because they claim since he's part wolf that he might bite someone. Balto lives on a boat with a goose named Boris (Who has a Russian accent) who gets constantly visited by two polar bears named Muk and Luk. But Balto has big dreams despite his problems, he wants to be on a sled team and he has a love interest for a husky named Jenna. However, he constantly gets bullied by the town's main sled dog named Steel who also wants Jenna and is a complete jerk to get attention. Then the town experiences a diphtheria epidemic among children, and a sled team must be dispatched to make a six hundred mile journey to bring antitoxin to cure the children. But when the team gets lost and doesn't come back, Balto decides to find them and help bring back the antitoxin which ends up becoming a wild ride.MUSIC: I have yet to hear a bad musical score from James Horner, he certainly does not disappoint here. As usual, his musical compositions are wonderful and fit the mood very well, not to mention when the mood is right the music becomes rather thrilling.ACTING: Aside from some mildly campy dialogue, I really have no complaints with this area. Every one of the actors put on a great show, especially Kevin Bacon's performance as Balto. Everyone did a great job and fit their roles very well.ACTION: This film is never boring. It injects both humor and thrilling action moments into the mix, which proves to be an incredibly satisfying combination. The humor was pretty funny, and pretty clean (There were a few very mild innuendos, but they aren't too noticeable). The only complaint that I have about this area is that this film isn't long enough, as is the case with most animated films. They just aren't long enough (Yet crappy live-action films can stretch for a grueling two hours, and that is painful as hell).OVERALL: This is great family entertainment that will forever remain timeless. While I'd have to give the edge to All Dogs Go To Heaven in terms of which film is a better dog film (I'm sorry, but Balto didn't make me want to cry like ADGTH's ending), that's still not to say that I don't adore this film. This film is wonderful, and while it has a couple of minor flaws, that doesn't really matter because as it stands it is amazing.THE GOOD: Great voice-acting, good story, great music, thrilling action moments, and funny humor.THE BAD: It's not long enough and there is some mildly cheesy dialogue.",5,WHY DID I NOT OWN THIS YEARS AGO?!  9.25 OUT OF 10,1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,3202,"['title', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'buy', 'film', 'sooner', 'Balto', 'fantastic', 'excellent', 'piece', 'animated', 'film-making', 'Too', 'bad', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'think', 'just', 'everyone', 'who', 'saw', 'film', '45', '%', 'Fresh', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'WHAT', 'HELL', 'people', 'think', 'Madagascar', 'better', 'ratings', 'What', 'wrong', 'people', 'then', 'again', 'stopped', 'trusting', 'once', 'saw', 'also', 'trashed', 'All', 'Dogs', 'Go', 'Heaven', 'Balto', 'wonderful', 'thrilling', 'adventure', 'just', 'anyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'wonder', 'film', 'large', 'fanbase', 'now', ""'m"", 'part', 'it.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', '1925', 'Nome', 'Alaska', 'hero', 'Balto', 'half-breed', 'who', 'part', 'wolf', 'part', 'husky', 'why', 'just', 'everyone', 'town', 'crap', 'claim', 'part', 'wolf', 'might', 'bite', 'someone', 'Balto', 'boat', 'goose', 'named', 'Boris', 'Who', 'Russian', 'accent', 'who', 'constantly', 'visited', 'two', 'polar', 'bears', 'named', 'Muk', 'Luk', 'Balto', 'big', 'dreams', 'problems', 'be', 'sled', 'team', 'love', 'interest', 'husky', 'named', 'Jenna', 'However', 'constantly', 'bullied', 'town', 'main', 'sled', 'dog', 'named', 'Steel', 'who', 'also', 'Jenna', 'complete', 'jerk', 'get', 'attention', 'Then', 'town', 'diphtheria', 'epidemic', 'children', 'sled', 'team', 'must', 'be', 'dispatched', 'make', 'six', 'hundred', 'mile', 'journey', 'bring', 'antitoxin', 'cure', 'children', 'when', 'team', 'lost', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', 'Balto', 'find', 'help', 'bring', 'back', 'antitoxin', 'up', 'becoming', 'wild', 'ride.MUSIC', 'have', 'yet', 'hear', 'bad', 'musical', 'score', 'James', 'Horner', 'certainly', 'not', 'disappoint', 'here', 'usual', 'musical', 'compositions', 'are', 'wonderful', 'fit', 'mood', 'very', 'well', 'not', 'mention', 'when', 'mood', 'right', 'music', 'rather', 'thrilling.ACTING', 'Aside', 'mildly', 'campy', 'dialogue', 'really', 'have', 'complaints', 'area', 'one', 'actors', 'put', 'great', 'show', 'especially', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'performance', 'Balto', 'Everyone', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'fit', 'roles', 'very', 'well.ACTION', 'film', 'never', 'boring', 'humor', 'thrilling', 'action', 'moments', 'mix', 'be', 'incredibly', 'satisfying', 'combination', 'humor', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'pretty', 'clean', 'were', 'few', 'very', 'mild', 'innuendos', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'noticeable', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'area', 'film', ""n't"", 'long', 'enough', 'case', 'most', 'animated', 'films', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'long', 'enough', 'crappy', 'live-action', 'films', 'can', 'stretch', 'grueling', 'two', 'hours', 'painful', 'hell', '.OVERALL', 'great', 'family', 'entertainment', 'will', 'forever', 'remain', 'timeless', ""'d"", 'have', 'give', 'edge', 'Dogs', 'Go', 'Heaven', 'terms', 'film', 'better', 'dog', 'film', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Balto', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'want', 'cry', 'ADGTH', 'ending', 'still', 'not', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'adore', 'film', 'film', 'wonderful', 'couple', 'minor', 'flaws', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'amazing.THE', 'GOOD', 'Great', 'voice-acting', 'good', 'story', 'great', 'music', 'thrilling', 'action', 'moments', 'funny', 'humor.THE', 'BAD', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'mildly', 'cheesy', 'dialogue']",N/A

61463,A2IAR5XDY0KT2F,0783229291,Becky,"[21, 21]","An appealing story which will be cherished by people of all ages, this movie chronicles the life of Balto, a half husky, half wolf outcast whose  courage and noble spirit is ignored by the inhabitants of his hometown of  Nome, Alaska, the town dogs, and even the wolf packs of the surrounding  wilderness, because of his parentage.  The wolves won't accept him because  he is half husky.  The townspeople won't accept him because he is half  wolf, warning their children, &quot;You can't trust him.  He's half wolf.  He might bite you,&quot; ignoring his innate gentleness.  Little do they  realise that someday soon they will have cause to be grateful to Balto,  that they will paraise him as a hero.When Nome is stricken by a  diptheria epidemic, the only way the antidote can reach the town is via the  local sled dog team, which is led by the arrogant Steele.  But when the  team becomes lost in a blinding blizzard, it is up to Balto to rescue them,  compelling him to embark upon a journey so perilous that he is forced to  rely on his half wolf lineage in order to survive, during which he finally  learns to celebrate and appreciate this aspect of himself, realising that  this uniqueness is a gift.Unlike with Disney animated features, the  cinematic release of &quot;Balto&quot; didn't follow a lot of  studio-generated hype.  Perhaps that was a shame; perhaps had the hype been  bigger, more people might have gone to see it.  But no amount of hype can  describe the warmth, sincerity, compassion, and wholesomeness of this  story.  For it is a true gem, which even non animal lovers will enjoy.

The story liberally recycles archetypal characters from other animated classics (Balto is reminiscent of Disney's Tramp; his nemesis, Steele, is a canine copy of Gaston, from ""Beauty And The Beast,"" etc.) but these echoes of other films dont get in the way of a good, action-packed story.  The idea of a disease that kills children (in this case, diptheria) may be upsetting to smaller children; parents may wish to explain that this is a disease that has been all-but conquered by an aggressive modern vaccine program. Balancing this is the semi-historical presentation of a bygone era, the pioneer days of the Alaskan territory.  All in all, a good film for cartoon-savvy kids who are ready to graduate up from Cinderella and ""Sesame Street.""  Makes a great double-feature with the live-action ""Eight Below.""

It interested me when I watched it as a kid, and it interests me now even more since I know a little more about the history of Alaska. The film begins with a young girl, her grandmother, and her dog, walking through Central Park. The grandmother sees a statue of Balto (which is there in real life) and narrates the story of a dog who led a team that brought medicine to a town full of sick children when other modes of transportation could not.It's true that many aspects of the movie are fictionalized. We all know animals don't communicate in real life the way they do in the movie, so scenes involving their interactions are obviously made up. Furthermore, the real life Balto was not the only sled dog leader, was not part wolf, and was not quite the pariah this movie makes him out to be. But while I acknowledge these differences make the movie much different from the real story, I still think the movie is worth watching for its entertainment value. Had the producers stuck more closely to the way the expedition really was, the movie might not have been as interesting. If the differences bother you, don't watch the movie.

61480,A6225HHQKBE2M,0783229291,Jake,"[63, 75]","Balto is one of the most amazing animated features of all time, easily ranking with the best of Disney's efforts such as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King.""  However, this 1995 animated classic from Universal was buried like a dog bone at the box office, and hasn't achieved the popularity it deserves even in the home entertainment market.  Perhaps this is the reason that Universal decided to create a remarkably underwhelming DVD version.  This is quite possibly the worst DVD I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of DVDs in the two years I've owned a player.The biggest problem with this release is the movie-to-DVD transfer: not only is it poorly done and grainy, but the DVD executives at Universal decided to release it exclusively in fullscreen pan and scan format with a 1:33:1 aspect ratio which never even comes close to doing the stunning visuals justice.  The greatest asset of DVD, even greater than all of the room on each disc for extra features, is the widescreen capability, allowing the film to be experienced at home as it was in theaters, with up to 30% more picture presented to the left and right of the screen.  Fullscreen reformats the film for 1:33:1 televisions and in doing so cops out up to one third of the original widescreen picture, thus diminishing the epic splendor of many shots.  As do many animated features, ""Balto"" offers many stunning visual effects that would look absolutely amazing in widescreen, and yet Universal refuses to release the film as it was meant to be seen.  I love this movie, and it pains me very greatly to say that as it is, this DVD isn't any better than the original 1996 VHS version I have.The extra features here include a very unthoughtful, low-tech game clearly designed for the youngest children (although I can't imagine that anyone old enough to comprehend the movie would be interested in such a dry, boring game.)  The production notes and cast and crew bios are nothing much either.  The only true plus in this area is the theatrical trailer.As if this was not enough, Universal attached a forced-view preview for ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial"" to the beginning of the DVD, and it must be viewed every time you start the movie.  There is no way to skip it, and although ""E.T."" is one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of all time, it starts to get on your nerves having to watch the preview EVERY TIME you want to watch Balto.DVD is the home entertainment medium of the future, and is important on several levels.  When a DVD disc is made well, it does a number of things: a) presents the film in question in the best possible picture and sound available, b) gives the viewer interesting information regarding the film, such as how it was made, c) entertains the viewer with its extras and d) does all of this in an easy-to-use, easy-to-navigate, enjoyable system.  This DVD is certainly easy to use, but it fails to deliver on all other fronts.With this release, Universal is telling people that the film does not deserve a disc equal to even any decent one on the market today, let alone the best of the best.  I have been a loyal fan of this film ever since I first saw it in summer 1995, and find this highly insulting.  They will be receiving a nasty letter from me shortly for this underwhelming disc, and my only hope is that Universal will correct these mistakes in the future with an anamorphic widescreen edition featuring thoughtful, interesting bonuses such as ""The Making of Balto"" and audio commentary.  Until then, don't let the utter horridness of this release stop you from seeing this underrated gem of a movie, which I recommend very highly.

61496,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,0783229291,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 2]","For some reason I can't explain to myself, I had a childhood bias against dog-themed movies that stretched to the animation realm (I suppose I suspected they'd end up making me cry), and therefore I steered clear from ""Balto"" until only a few years ago. Shame on me, boy. What we have here is a quality animated tale, able to go head-to-head with most Disney output, and very easily the best of the three features produced by Steven Spielberg's way-too-short-lived Amblimation company. It has some shortcomings that most likely played against it during its theatrical run, but the movie perseveres through style and production strength, thoroughly earning its spot as a cult classic and home video favorite.The story: loosely based on a true event, Balto (voiced by Kevin Bacon,Mystic River) is a dog-wolf crossbreed who must prove his worth and place in a small Alaskan community by rescuing a sled team relaying a crate of valuable medicine to the stricken town across the dangerous sub-Arctic wilderness.Aficionados of strong mainstream animation will be getting an eyeful. In comparison to Amblimation's previous two films, ""Balto"" ranks number one: it's infinitely finer and more detailed thanWe're Back! A Dinosaur's Story, and whileAn American Tail - Fievel Goes Westwas arguably more expressive with a jump-out-at-you illustration quality, it was less coordinated and a bit too over-the-place by contrast. I've always appreciated the art style that director Simon Wells brings to the table, and this one ought to be considered his magnum opus for how well he pulls everything off here: the animal animation manages to be both graceful and funny depending on the character, the rotoscoping used for human characters is as smooth as Don Bluth could ever have managed, and the limited computer-generated objects and environment pieces are tastefully rendered and harmonious to the film's predominant 2D art style...95% of the time. It's a pretty gorgeous picture.The voice acting's good and solid. Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger Rabbit) as Boris the goose, Bridget Fonda (Jackie Brown) as Jenna the lady husky, and voice-acting stalwart Jim Cummings (The Lion King) as the narcissistic antagonist are great as immediate co-stars, and Phil Collins is pretty funny in one of only two voice acting roles he's taken, this time as a pair of hydrophobic polar bear cubs. Kevin Bacon does a pretty good job as Balto, but since the movie makes such a huge deal out of his being a half-breed - a possible allusion to mixed race Native Americanism - he might have been more authentically played by a young Indian actor like Jay Tavare or Paul Litefoot. Moving beyond the casting, the only fault I can find with the movie is in its writing: most notably, the inclusion of Muk and Luk - Phil Collins' characters - is redundant, since Bob Hoskins was already supplying comic relief within his mentor role. I also was kind of a annoyed with a dumbE.T.reference late in the movie and a really forced sequence wherein Jim Cummings' character keeps Balto from joining the sled team by stepping on his paw and making him bare his teeth at the team leader - what, were the humans so unobservant that they didn't see this was a provoked response?Gunnar Kaasen, the real-life musher who drove Balto and his team during the historical relay, is also a voiced and animated character but he's not explored at all or even named in the movie - perhaps the one thing the film was missing, to give it a greater sense of legitimacy. However, as it currently stands, ""Balto"" is very good, with a strong story that needed telling and probably otherwise would've been snatched up by Disney in the future, but it's not perfect. Luckily, its imperfections are overlookable and don't keep the film from retaining its well-deserved status as a cult classic and credible alternative to other big studio output of the time.",4,"""This wolf business again.

For the most part, I don't have a problem with creative choices in that area, but such extreme departures as we see in this film just bother me...hens the rating here.  For one thing, Balto led the team that covered the final length of the difficult journey seen on the screen.  In fact, the other teams that played a role in the relay that delivered the crucial medication weren't mentioned.  Furthermore, the real Balto was bred in a kennel from Huskies...no wolves involved.  He was consequently not an outcast.  But, apart from that and other creative liberties, the film can be very entertaining.  Boris, a goose voiced by Bob Hoskins, and Muk and Luk, a pair of bears voiced by Phil Collins, were pretty funny.  And the film's best quality is its awesome soundtrack.  I particularly enjoyed the music in the ""white wolf"" scene and the final music set over the last four or so minutes.

She went on to say that there is actually a Balto statue in New York City that we could visit. There is a strong message in this movie - and a positive one at that that leaves a lasting impression!

Jim Cummings did a fabulous job portraying Steele as well, making the malamute just so gosh-darn-cool for a baddie.  The story, while perhaps not entirely acurate with history, is still a good one and I love to watch this on a cold winter's day with a cup of hot cocoa.Highly recommended!",5,"Way to go, Balto!",988502400,"04 29, 2001",2001,422,"['have', 'seen', 'dozen', 'times', 'least', 'still', 'love', 'movie.The', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'Balto', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'did', 'fabulous', 'job', 'portraying', 'Steele', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'malamute', 'just', 'so', 'gosh-darn-cool', 'baddie', 'story', 'perhaps', 'not', 'entirely', 'acurate', 'history', 'still', 'good', 'one', 'love', 'watch', 'cold', 'winter', 'day', 'cup', 'hot', 'cocoa.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
61506,A1C9GCHR99WX3F,0783229291,Stephen Verhaeren,"[8, 12]","Balto is one of the best movies. Plus it is hard to believe that this is a rare live action and animated movie. Jim Cummings should gets a lot of parts in animated movies. He was the voice of Steele (who hates Balto). This movie is based on a true story. Balto is half dog and half wolf. But even though I'm confused on how is is half dog and half wolf. Plus how do you know what happened since mosty of the time we see animals. And how do the trail the dogs races are raced that is the same trail Balto and the sled dogs took to bring medince to thier town in Alaska. As the movie opens, a grandmother (Miram Margolyes) and her granddaughter (Lola Bates-Campbell) are looking for a memorial of the sled dogs that took a trail to bring medince to thier town in the winter of 1925. The Granddaughter (at first) doesn't know what she and her grandmother are looking for. So they take a rest and the grandmother tells her the story of Balto (Kevin Bacon) and the snow dog team. Which this part of the movie is animated. Blato is not the favorite dog in town and is hated by Steele (voiced by Jim Cummings). But when a little girl gets sick and is in the hospital, Steele and other dogs (expect Balto) are sent to get the medince. But when the dogs get lost, Balto heads out to find them.My thoughts on Balto are: First this movie is based on a true story. I am not sure about the girl and her grandmother also realed happened in this movie. But here is one thing I don't belive that really happened the animals talked (and the stuff that happened that there wasn't any humans present). But if you love animated or live action movies, I reccomend this one. But I don't know why the memorial is in New York City when Balto and everybody else in the story lived in Normal, Alaska.",5,This is one of the best movies around!,1044316800,"02 4, 2003",2003,1774,"['Balto', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'hard', 'believe', 'rare', 'live', 'action', 'animated', 'movie', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'should', 'lot', 'parts', 'animated', 'movies', 'was', 'voice', 'Steele', 'who', 'Balto', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Balto', 'half', 'dog', 'half', 'wolf', 'even', ""'m"", 'confused', 'how', 'half', 'dog', 'half', 'wolf', 'how', 'do', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'mosty', 'time', 'see', 'animals', 'how', 'do', 'trail', 'dogs', 'races', 'are', 'raced', 'same', 'trail', 'Balto', 'sled', 'dogs', 'took', 'bring', 'medince', 'thier', 'town', 'Alaska', 'movie', 'grandmother', 'Miram', 'Margolyes', 'granddaughter', 'Lola', 'Bates-Campbell', 'are', 'looking', 'memorial', 'sled', 'dogs', 'took', 'trail', 'bring', 'medince', 'thier', 'town', 'winter', '1925', 'Granddaughter', 'first', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'grandmother', 'are', 'looking', 'take', 'rest', 'grandmother', 'story', 'Balto', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'snow', 'dog', 'team', 'Which', 'part', 'movie', 'animated', 'Blato', 'not', 'favorite', 'dog', 'town', 'hated', 'Steele', 'voiced', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'when', 'little', 'girl', 'sick', 'hospital', 'Steele', 'other', 'dogs', 'expect', 'Balto', 'are', 'sent', 'get', 'medince', 'when', 'dogs', 'get', 'lost', 'Balto', 'out', 'find', 'them.My', 'thoughts', 'Balto', 'are', 'First', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'girl', 'grandmother', 'also', 'realed', 'happened', 'movie', 'here', 'one', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'belive', 'really', 'happened', 'animals', 'talked', 'stuff', 'happened', 'was', ""n't"", 'humans', 'present', 'love', 'animated', 'live', 'action', 'movies', 'reccomend', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'memorial', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'when', 'Balto', 'everybody', 'else', 'story', 'lived', 'Normal', 'Alaska']",N/A

But now I'm an absolute fan of this movie, and I've must seen it a few dozens of time now... Why? Outside of its classical aspects, this is simply a well done animated movie. To me, there's everything you need to make a great movie : great animation, attractive characters, a beautiful story, a good production... There's no dead time, no songs (except for the excellent credits one), and it's a really good thing. But above all, I love the soundtrack, composed by James Horner (= Titanic, Braveheart...) There are probably the most awesome and varied themes I've ever heard in this kind of movies. And I'm sure everybody would have put it up among Disney's greatest movies, if it had been one!
