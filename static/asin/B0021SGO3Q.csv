This is one of the four critical video documentaries that covers down on the Aleutian Campaign of World War II in Alaska - sometimes referred to as the forgotten war. It is in the good company and traditions of such documentaries as 'Red White Black & Blue', 'Report From The Aleutians', and 'Alaska At War'. For any student of the second world war, this is an important treatment of this extraordinary (and generally under-reported) campaign. It also closely compliments the written works of Stan Cohen's series on the Aleutian Campaign. I strongly recommend it! - Prof Mike Haller",5,'The Bloody Aleutians' - Documentary,1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,620,"['Bloody', 'Aleutians', 'Documentary', 'one', 'four', 'critical', 'video', 'documentaries', 'down', 'Aleutian', 'Campaign', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Alaska', 'sometimes', 'referred', 'forgotten', 'war', 'good', 'company', 'traditions', 'such', 'documentaries', ""'Red"", 'White', 'Black', 'Blue', 'Aleutians', 'War', 'student', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'important', 'treatment', 'extraordinary', 'generally', 'under-reported', 'campaign', 'also', 'closely', 'written', 'works', 'Stan', 'Cohen', 'series', 'Aleutian', 'Campaign', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'Prof', 'Mike', 'Haller']",Bloody Aleutians
