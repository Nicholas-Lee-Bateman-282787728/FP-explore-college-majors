844695,A16F8X6UOWHEIX,B0002SPPSC,"Christopher ""deezer1986""","[3, 4]","Live At Montreux 82 & 85 is an awesome DVD that showcases just how truly great Stevie Ray Vaughan is. The 82 show is the sort of legend. Everyone's heard the story: Stevie gets booed, but David Bowie catches his performance, and later, Jackson Browne hears him down in the Musician's Bar. Stevie later winds up playing on David Bowie's record Let's Dance, and also records what would become Texas Flood at Jackson's studio. The 85 show represents a sort of conquering-hero party, where everyone is there to hear him and applaud his every great lick. Stevie, in both shows, is in fine form, playing beautifully, and singing as gritty as ever. Personally, the 82 show is my favorite of the two, because, despite the boos, he never gives up, keeps playing in spite of them. The 85 show is great, and he really gives a good go on that one as well.The documentary included with the 82 show is really great, with insights from Tommy and Chris, Jackson Browne, and John Mayer. John Mayer provides some good insight at the way people from this generation look at Stevie. He had some great quotes in this documentary, like ""Stevie always quoted his resources,"" and ""This guy knew what was going on before he even left his house."" Jackson, Tommy, and Chris interviews give good insight as to what actually happened that fateful few days in 1982. The only thing that would've made it great would have been to have David Bowie on the documentary as well, but that's an extremely minor complaint. Also, due to some camera stupidity, the encore of the 85 show; Life Without You, Gone Home, and Couldn't Stand The Weather; are only shot from a far-away camera. In addition, some technical problems occurred, so about 2 and a half minutes of Couldn't Stand The Weather weren't shot. So, some photo stills were put in instead. That is not anyone's fault except the people who shot the show that night, so that's not something you can really complain about. And congrats to Epic for putting in the entire 85 show. Including Cold Shot and Look At Little Sister with Johnny Copeland was a good move. Those songs kick, and I wish they would've put those on the cd version instead of the 13 minute version of Tin Pan Alley.Overall, this is a great DVD set, and is something that adds to Stevie Ray Vaughan's monumental legacy. He was and is one of the best guitar players of all-time. My advice: buy this beauty of a set, and sit back and get a real treat.

844696,AMPW2XLJQISVZ,B0002SPPSC,"Cory B. ""Ronnie Milsap""","[1, 1]","Is it just a coincidence that when Stevie Ray Vaughan died in 1990, American music as a whole suddenly seemed to die with him?? Few performers in the last 15 years have possessed the overwhelming talent and magic that this man had. The 1990's sadly became the decade when real talent and originality became a thing of the past as manufactured pop, rock, and country clones took over the national music scene like a bad disease. The release of these two concerts are a blessing if for no other reason than to remind music fans today what REAL TALENT and musicianship is.The two concerts on this DVD set are significant in SRV's career and are presented with good sound and picture quality. Both shows consist of solid performances, but neither show truly captures Stevie Ray at his absolute best. The 1982 appearance is probably the best of the two, although Stevie's dynamic stage presence that is evident in other live footage seems a little withheld here. The 1985 show features the expanded Double Trouble line-up with Reese Wynans on keyboards, but Stevie was visibly near the peak of his drug abuse when this concert was filmed, and his performance seems to lack some of the fire and passion that is clearly seen in the 1983 El Mocambo show and the two Austin City Limits appearances. The far away camera angle during the encore of the 85 show is also a little disappointing.In the historic 1982 concert presented in this set, we witness a crowd of closed-minded morons mercilessly booing a guy with far more talent than anybody on the charts today could ever hope to have. It was nice to see at least some in the audience were cheering and applauding in appreciation of SRV's performance, and you gotta love how Stevie Ray and the band totally ignored the boos throughout the entire show and just kept on rockin! It is sad to think that if Vaughan were the opening act for one of today's hot new stars, he would likely receive the same reaction that he got from the Montreux crowd that night in 1982. Would today's pop/metal/rap fans appreciate a guy who only needs ""talent"" to captivate an audience instead of smoke, lights, mirrors, or half naked girls???The guest appearance of blues legend Johnny Copeland is the definite highlight of the 85 concert! Copeland makes the most of his three-song set, cutting loose on some hot solos with Stevie on a rockin version of ""Look at little sister"". Stevie and Johnny's great duet on the down and dirty blues masterpiece ""Tin Pan Alley"" is the finest moment of this entire DVD for me as Copeland delivers some of the greatest blues singing I've ever heard in the second verse of this song! For aspiring blues vocalists, Johnny's singing here is a true lesson in the art of blues singing at its best! With so many flashy blues-rock guitarists throughout the years, it seems that great blues singing has become a lost art these days. Only the very best blues singers can deliver the kind of vocal performance that Johnny Copeland does here.Live footage of the great Stevie Ray Vaughan is still pretty rare which makes these two concerts a must-have for any blues fan, even if the El Mocambo show and the Austin City Limits appearances are a little better. We can only hope there are at least one or two more live shows from SRV's short career that will make it to DVD someday soon.",4,Two Historic Stevie Ray Concerts come to DVD,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,3329,"['just', 'coincidence', 'when', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'Vaughan', 'died', '1990', 'American', 'music', 'whole', 'suddenly', 'seemed', 'die', 'Few', 'performers', 'last', '15', 'years', 'have', 'possessed', 'overwhelming', 'talent', 'magic', 'man', 'had', '1990', 'sadly', 'became', 'decade', 'when', 'real', 'talent', 'originality', 'became', 'thing', 'past', 'manufactured', 'pop', 'rock', 'country', 'clones', 'took', 'over', 'national', 'music', 'scene', 'bad', 'disease', 'release', 'two', 'concerts', 'are', 'blessing', 'other', 'reason', 'remind', 'music', 'fans', 'today', 'what', 'REAL', 'TALENT', 'musicianship', 'is.The', 'two', 'concerts', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'significant', 'SRV', 'career', 'are', 'presented', 'good', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'shows', 'consist', 'solid', 'performances', 'show', 'truly', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'absolute', 'best', '1982', 'appearance', 'probably', 'best', 'two', 'Stevie', 'dynamic', 'stage', 'presence', 'evident', 'other', 'live', 'footage', 'little', 'withheld', 'here', '1985', 'show', 'expanded', 'Double', 'Trouble', 'line-up', 'Reese', 'Wynans', 'keyboards', 'Stevie', 'was', 'visibly', 'peak', 'drug', 'abuse', 'when', 'concert', 'was', 'filmed', 'performance', 'lack', 'fire', 'passion', 'clearly', 'seen', '1983', 'El', 'Mocambo', 'show', 'two', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'appearances', 'far', 'away', 'camera', 'angle', 'encore', '85', 'show', 'also', 'little', 'disappointing.In', 'historic', '1982', 'concert', 'presented', 'set', 'witness', 'crowd', 'closed-minded', 'morons', 'mercilessly', 'booing', 'guy', 'far', 'more', 'talent', 'anybody', 'charts', 'today', 'could', 'ever', 'hope', 'have', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'least', 'audience', 'were', 'cheering', 'applauding', 'appreciation', 'SRV', 'performance', 'got', 'ta', 'love', 'how', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'band', 'totally', 'ignored', 'boos', 'entire', 'show', 'just', 'kept', 'rockin', 'sad', 'think', 'Vaughan', 'were', 'opening', 'act', 'one', 'today', 'hot', 'new', 'stars', 'would', 'likely', 'receive', 'same', 'reaction', 'got', 'Montreux', 'crowd', 'night', '1982', 'Would', 'today', 'pop/metal/rap', 'fans', 'appreciate', 'guy', 'who', 'only', 'talent', 'captivate', 'audience', 'instead', 'smoke', 'lights', 'mirrors', 'half', 'naked', 'girls', 'guest', 'appearance', 'blues', 'legend', 'Johnny', 'Copeland', 'definite', 'highlight', '85', 'concert', 'Copeland', 'most', 'three-song', 'set', 'cutting', 'loose', 'hot', 'solos', 'Stevie', 'rockin', 'version', 'Look', 'little', 'sister', 'Stevie', 'Johnny', 'great', 'duet', 'down', 'dirty', 'blues', 'masterpiece', 'Tin', 'Pan', 'Alley', 'finest', 'moment', 'entire', 'DVD', 'Copeland', 'greatest', 'blues', 'singing', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'second', 'verse', 'song', 'aspiring', 'blues', 'vocalists', 'Johnny', 'singing', 'here', 'true', 'lesson', 'art', 'blues', 'singing', 'best', 'so', 'many', 'flashy', 'blues-rock', 'guitarists', 'years', 'great', 'blues', 'singing', 'become', 'lost', 'art', 'days', 'Only', 'very', 'best', 'blues', 'singers', 'can', 'deliver', 'kind', 'vocal', 'performance', 'Johnny', 'Copeland', 'here.Live', 'footage', 'great', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'Vaughan', 'still', 'pretty', 'rare', 'two', 'concerts', 'must-have', 'blues', 'fan', 'even', 'El', 'Mocambo', 'show', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'appearances', 'are', 'little', 'better', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'are', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'more', 'live', 'shows', 'SRV', 'short', 'career', 'will', 'make', 'DVD', 'someday', 'soon']",N/A
844697,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B0002SPPSC,Craig Connell,"[0, 2]","I read somewhere once that if you really want a composite of what Stevie Ray Vaughan was all about, musically, all you need is this DVD. I totally agree. I have a half dozen SRV discs or tapes but nothing tops this.You get two concerts, one on each disc. The first is the ""controversial"" 1982 concert at Montreux (in Switzerland) and the other is the 1985 return trip to Montreux. The first was ""controverial"" in the reception Vaughan and his band received during and immediately after the performing: booing! It is shocking to hear. I've never heard an artist booed on a disc put out for public release, but it's in here. (There were a lot of cheers, too.) Of course, the booing and catcalls were totally unwarranted. The band was excellent and Stevie was tremendous, but the crowd was expecting what they had heard all day: quiet, acoustic blues guitar. When SRV turned up the amps and did his thing, some of them didn't like it. Nonetheless, I liked it and chances are you will, too, if you are a fan of his, or simply blues/rock. What I liked best were a couple of his long, slow numbers, such as ""Dirty Pool.""On that disc is a documentary, with band members Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon, discussing that '82 concert and what happened afterward. Jackson Browne also gives his take on his participation in helping out SRV and the band. It's pretty interesting.By 1985, the crowd knew all about SRV and gave him a great reception and he put on the best show, perhaps, I have ever seen him (and the band) do - just electrifying. In fact, there are four straight numbers - Tiny Pan Alley (a.k.a. Roughest Place In Town, Look At Little Sister, Voodoo Chile and Texas Flood - that are done so well that I had tears in my eyes. That is THE best version Vaughan has ever done on the Jimi Hendrix number (Voodoo Chile) and you have to just see and hear this to believe it. SRV pulls out all the stops, doing things with a guitar I've never seen before.Folks, it's true: this is the Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble DVD to get, above all others.",5,"Nothing Tops This Is, If You Like SRV",1226620800,"11 14, 2008",2008,2046,"['read', 'somewhere', 'once', 'really', 'want', 'composite', 'what', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'Vaughan', 'was', 'musically', 'need', 'DVD', 'totally', 'agree', 'have', 'half', 'dozen', 'SRV', 'discs', 'tapes', 'nothing', 'tops', 'this.You', 'get', 'two', 'concerts', 'one', 'disc', 'first', 'controversial', '1982', 'concert', 'Montreux', 'Switzerland', 'other', '1985', 'return', 'trip', 'Montreux', 'first', 'was', 'controverial', 'reception', 'Vaughan', 'band', 'received', 'immediately', 'performing', 'booing', 'shocking', 'hear', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'artist', 'booed', 'disc', 'put', 'out', 'public', 'release', 'here', 'were', 'lot', 'cheers', 'too', 'course', 'booing', 'catcalls', 'were', 'totally', 'unwarranted', 'band', 'was', 'excellent', 'Stevie', 'was', 'tremendous', 'crowd', 'was', 'expecting', 'what', 'had', 'heard', 'day', 'quiet', 'acoustic', 'blues', 'guitar', 'When', 'SRV', 'turned', 'up', 'amps', 'did', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'Nonetheless', 'liked', 'chances', 'are', 'will', 'too', 'are', 'fan', 'simply', 'blues/rock', 'What', 'liked', 'best', 'were', 'couple', 'long', 'slow', 'numbers', 'such', 'Dirty', 'Pool', 'disc', 'documentary', 'band', 'members', 'Chris', 'Layton', 'Tommy', 'Shannon', 'discussing', ""'82"", 'concert', 'what', 'happened', 'afterward', 'Jackson', 'Browne', 'also', 'take', 'participation', 'helping', 'out', 'SRV', 'band', 'pretty', 'interesting.By', '1985', 'crowd', 'knew', 'SRV', 'gave', 'great', 'reception', 'put', 'best', 'show', 'perhaps', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'band', 'do', 'just', 'electrifying', 'fact', 'are', 'four', 'straight', 'numbers', 'Tiny', 'Pan', 'Alley', 'a.k.a', 'Roughest', 'Place', 'Town', 'Look', 'Little', 'Sister', 'Voodoo', 'Chile', 'Texas', 'Flood', 'are', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'had', 'tears', 'eyes', 'best', 'version', 'Vaughan', 'ever', 'done', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'number', 'Voodoo', 'Chile', 'have', 'just', 'see', 'hear', 'believe', 'SRV', 'out', 'stops', 'doing', 'things', 'guitar', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'before.Folks', 'true', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'Vaughan', 'Double', 'Trouble', 'DVD', 'get', 'others']",N/A

You can see a durastic change in stevie ray vaughan's sound from the 1982 performence to the 1985 performence. Also a much cleaner stevie ray vaughan being sober since his drug addiction. The first performence really showcases the early stardum of Vaughan's career as a blues musician including many shuffles such as Hide Away, Rude Mood, and Collins Shuffle. While vaughan play's Texas Flood the crowd respond's with many boooo's, but they never brought stevie ray vaughan's performence down by any means. Then Stevie Ray Vaughan goes on with a great performence of Love Struck Baby. On (Give Me Back My Wig) stevie ray vaughan play's a slide which is rare for anyone to see in the time period of 1982 live.When I watched the second DVD of Stevie Ray Vaughan's 1985 Montreux performence I was twice as excited as watching the first dvd. The sound was very more polished with Reese Wynans on organ. So was the other members of the band including Chris Layton(drums), Tommy Shannon(bass), and of course Stevie Ray Vaughan who played many differnt guitars that night including his charley guitar, and his number 1. Scuttle Buttin' starts the second show off with many cheers...the crowd responding happier. I also love when Stevie Ray Vaughan kicks into Say What which was on the LIVE ALIVE album. Their are many more great songs including a great blues performence with Johnny Copeland on guitar on the following songs including Cold Shot, Tin Pan Alley, and Look At Little Sister. Layton describes on the bonus feature that Stevie Ray Vaughan loved johnny copeland as a blues guitarist. This DVD is truely loaded with all the materials a Stevie Ray Vaughan fan would love including 'Success In Disguise' an documentary featuring interviews with Chris Layton, Tommy Shannon, Jackson Browne, and John Mayer. Their is also a huge booklet including SRV talks about montreux, and many rare photo's. This DVD is highly recomended by me.

844703,A2SIXKZZ1MOQDG,B0002SPPSC,James J. Rossignol,"[1, 2]","Stevie Ray Vaughan at Montreux is almost twenty five years old now, but it could have been filmed yesterday.  His playing and delivery are awe inspiring and original.  Stevie was one of a kind and is sorely missed.  For a fan of his this is a welcome addition to his body of work.  Even an unfriendly crowd in the first performance fail to keep him from delivering the goods the way he did every night.  He was the blues through and through and remained faithful to them for his entire life.  He lived the blues and was the real deal.  Although the first concert is short it is still absorbing as Stevie wailed through the boos and catcalls.  Somehow you feel he was misunderstood, but he remained unswayed.  He plowed through his set with his band close behind.  Tight to term this band is a gross understatement.  The second show was with the final lineup of the band with Reese Wynans performing as a skillful sideman.  But the main thing was still the blues even as Stevie shared the stage with Johnny Copeland.  He was a generous soul and was careful not to overshadow his friend but compliment him.  The second show was a complete triumph with the audience and with those who are priviliged years later to witness it for themselves.  Stevie was a rare star who never failed to be humble yet inspired at the same time.  He is badly missed by his fans and lovers everywhere of the electric guitar.  Fate is cruel sometimes but Stevie left behind a legacy that will never be forgotten.  The blues carry on but with a heavy heart.  I feel for Stevie but know that he is somewhere else with a guitar still firmly in hand.  This dvd captures the master at home in his element, live.  The only shame is that I never got to see Stevie in person and fully appreciate his style and genius.

He was playing small clubs in Texas with drummer Chris Layton and bassist Tommy Shannon in 1982 when someone with connections heard them and declared ""you need to play Montreux"".  Sooo... without a record, a recording contract or any name recognition outside of the handful of people who had heard them playing in Texas, they headed over to Europe where they were booked at the famous Montreux Jazz festival on the same day as several acoustic stars.  Stevie and Double Trouble hit the stage with their electrified cyclone and played to a rousing chorus of boos.  Stevie, talented as he was, dressed like a cross between a Texas Gunslinger and a New Orleans Pimp, and the crowd reaction ranged between indifference and total hostility.  Were they good?  Take a listen... the accompanying and extremely informative documentary features interviews with Slater and Layton, along with Jackson Browne, John Mayer, and a few others who knew what happened that day.  SRV and DT burned that stage to the ground.  They had honed their 3-piece Texas Blues to a fine edge and they unleashed their power on that crowd.  The ""music fans"", too stupid to notice the genius in front of their very eyes, hadn't yet been told by radio disc jockeys who they should like.... so they didn't like SRV - yet.  Of course there were musicians there too, though, and the word spread like wildfire through Jackson Browne's band.... and David Bowie.... and soon all the Montreux musicians were down in the musician's lounge listening to the kind of band that makes musicians tell other musicians ""come here.... you've just GOT to hear THIS!""  (I had the same experience the first time my brother played their first recording - which was made as a result of this very concert.)  David Bowie had to figure out a way to get this guitar genius on his CD and in his band. (Listen to Stevie's wailing guitar on ""Let's Dance"".) Jackson Browne offered the contractless trio the opportunity to record in his studio.  They made their way out to California and basically just recorded their live set in the studio.  THAT recording became ""Texas Flood"" and all of a sudden SRV was not an unknown...Two albums and a keyboardist later, Stevie returned to Montreux in 1985 as a ""conquering hero"" of sorts and although I would hesitate to say that they sounded better in the '85 concert, it is certainly gratifying to see them received with open-armed enthusiasm.  In the '82 concert they only played about 52 minutes.  In '85 they turn it on for a hot hour and a half.Both of those concerts are more than worth a listen - and this fantastic double-disc set includes both concerts, plus the documentary.

844711,A12S5XTMAHYYME,B0002SPPSC,Perry Celestino,"[64, 67]","Like most people who are into Blues, I couldn't wait to see this set when it was released. It contained two SRV sets at a very reasonable price and a short documentary as well as 5.1 DTS sound. Well it is great! Like my all time favourite, Albert King (see my reviews), material available on SRV (for all his impact in the 1980s) is rather scarce. I even saw him in Australia and he was so loud you really couldn't appreciate it, he needed smaller venues! This was a great chance to see him perform.I think the overall production of this set is excellent, as it usually is at Montreux. Great sound and camera work.Well as a Blues enthusiast of 40 years. I think the first disc is far better than the second (but I love Reese Wynans keyboards). All the hipe about him being booed to me is overplayed. As a guitarist he was better when he was hungry, than after he became famous (do you know of a bluesman, not rock, that actually produced better material after they got famous?)(Listen to Buddy Guy, Albert King, Little Walter, Junior Wells, etc etc even Johnny Winter, the original SRV). So this is great and I agree the El Mocambo set is great, but I rate the first disc as his best work.Top selection to me on Disc one is how he modernized Freddie King's Hideaway and combined it with Rude Mood (Urban/Country Blues). Just great. And the final tune is a great Albert Collins salute without copying Collins difficult style-you still recognise it (like in some of Duke Robillard's work). Fantastic! The old standbys- Texas Flood and Pride and Joy are great of course and his great slow blues Dirty Pool has that great unexpected chordal solo- an ode to Otis Rush's ""Double Trouble"" without, again, copying him completely (except the intro).The booing didin't bother me. It's not as  bad as the publicity made out. Most people are dancing and clapping and getting into it. If all booed maybe Stevie should have worried, but that wasn't likely. European audiences are strange as the Doors said in 1968, ""they didn't clap or anything, they just stared"". You know anything new from outside always has had trouble with Europeans, they are more traditional than we colonists. That's why in the 1960s the Folk Blues festival was so popular, they had Howlin Wolf and Muddy,(they were stuck in the 1950s) but never Paul Butterfield or Steve Miller.Well this DVD is a landmark. Advice: If you can get this in PAL: the sound and picture quality is better. I am in Bahrain travelling and just bought another copy in PAL to supplement my NTSC one.  Great!!!The second disc has some replication of course. The addition to the band of Reese Wynans was a great move. Made them a Booker T & the MGs's with rock guitar and singing. All tracks are great, but the Slow Blues Tin Pan Alley with the late Johnny Copeland (who won a Grammy with Robert Cray and Albert Collins for the ""Showdown"" LP) is my personal favourite. Intense and honest the way the Blues should be!!! Actually the whole Copeland sub-set is my favourite part of the disc along with, again the opening instrumental of Scuttle-Buttin and Say What!Every Blues fan should own this historic DVD. Note, some useless information: SRV was the age Jimi Hendrix died when he played on Disc 1. He was also born the year the Stratocaster was first released by Fender.Also: To comment on a previous review. It seems that in ""Ain't Gone 'N' Give Up On Love"" Stevie switches guitars- from Old Number One Strat. Well it looks to me like he probably broke one of his heavy gauge strings on the first solo, changed guitars, and played on.

It;s really sad he died so early inhis career and in his life.,5,Saw this...,1106784000,"01 27, 2005",2005,727,"['saw', '1985', 'concert', 'TV', 'awhile', 'ago', 'DirectTV', 'theyhave', 'free', 'concert', 'month', 'showed', 'one.I', 'must', 'say', 'touched', 'see', 'place', 'such', 'passionand', 'concentration', 'kicked', 'off', 'Scuttle', 'Buttin', 'whichis', 'one', 'best', 'instrumentals', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'theproblems', 'have', 'been', 'talked', 'several', 'reviews.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'raised', 'Blues', 'wish', 'raised', 'countrymusic', 'rock', 'growing', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chanceto', 'hear', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'Vaughan', 'growing', 'up', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Ipicked', 'up', 'concert', 'locked', 'up', 'asone', 'favorite', 'musicians', 'ever', 'got', 'recordedand', 'watch', 'listen', 'often', 'simply', ""isn'tanything"", 'really', 'sad', 'died', 'so', 'early', 'inhis', 'career', 'life']",N/A

The bad vibe of the 82 show is very haunting and hard to shake, but what you get is a man who has doubt's but also has a toughness. The crowd is not intrusive on Dirty Pool and it's hard to find a decent version of this song, this one is. The version of Texas Flood here may be the definitive version solo SRV. I prefere the BB King/SRV version. Disc 2; Ain't Gone And Give Up On Love is available no where else and this is as good as any stevie performance of Any song. The rest is dissapointing.
