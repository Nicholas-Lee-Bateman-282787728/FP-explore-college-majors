Try to wrap your mind around that for a moment.  As I sit here and type, or as you sit there and read this review, there are people experiencing their lives through sadness, adventure, humor, or experimentation.  There are those who are finally breaking free from the monotony of life by exploring outside of the box to see where an unfocused, un-traveled path may lead them.  Alas, not all of these stories can make it to the screen, not all of the stories can be told, and not all of these stories deserve to - but thankfully acclaimed director Walter Salles picked up his camera, brought together a group of minimalist characters, and told one story that wasn't filled with CGI, wasn't headlined with big name box-office sensations, and wasn't filled with so many clich&eacute;s that it would seem obvious Hollywood was financing the project.  Salles instead told a simple story about a family struggling with tradition, about a son ready to experience life, and about nobodies awakening themselves to a fresh bold day.  This is ""Abril Despedacado"" or ""Behind the Sun"", and for the normal film watcher this is probably a boring foreign film that dragged on for too long because of the intelligence of our nation, but for me, this film was closely near to cinematic perfection.""Abril Despedacado"" is one of those films that you cannot judge directly after watching.  It is one of those films that needs to be developed within your mind first, chewed after, re-watched, then tackled.  It is not a simple film, yet Salles makes it so.  Confused?  I was too after watching this film, not because of the storyline, but because of my insecurity of emotion felt towards this title.  Typically, I can say - ""Nope"", or ""Yep, loved it"", but with this one it took me two viewings to fully find myself saying, ""This was nearly a masterpiece"".  This isn't your typical Hollywood film, but neither was his original first ""Central Station"", this is a film with minimal players, coupled with a simple plot, yet emotion raining down from the sky like fire.  It is about a family that is so caught up in tradition, that living just isn't available.  Year after year, or in this iteration, months after months, two families struggling for control over land (the bickering and death has gone on for so long that the land seems so unimportant in the grand scheme) kill one another in hopes that this final blow will be the last.  The crazy thing about tradition, it keeps going - and this one is not different - until now.  Two brothers, workhorses, who question this tradition after one is faced with the undutiful task of killing, look outside their small box of a life to see what else is out there to life for.  It is there they find something that has been missing - imagination, love, and most importantly - a life.My description above seems, and feels to me like ultimate cheese spread on a film.  Why would I like this?  I think the first thing that pulled me towards this sleeper foreign film was the fact that I never quite new what was going to happen next.  The story was solid, when I say that I mean it was lacking the typical holes that clich&eacute; Hollywood standards.  This story was so simple (yet not), that Salles was able to focus on our characters, enriching us with images of the land, the culture, and the possibilities.  The fact that this is a foreign film takes us away from the hardships, makes it almost fantastical, yet keeps us grandly rooted in reality.  I felt sympathy for all the characters because there was no defined evil, I wanted them to explore, go on adventures, and see opportunities that this tradition was holding them back from.  I loved the character of Pacu, or ""The Kid"", as he read the book given to him from a circus performer.  The fact that he couldn't read didn't stop him from using his imagination, bringing stories to life, and enjoying a small cusp of life that we typically take for granted.  What could have been dull or trite transformed by Salles vision into pure gold.  This was more than just a film, but instead a cry to anyone that may feel the pressures of work getting them down, and looking for any opportunity to escape.  ""Abril Despedacado"" is a universal story, rooted within an obscure culture.  Why did this take me two viewings to see it?I must say everything fell perfectly into place with ""Abril Despedacado"", nothing was missing, nothing was forgotten, and nothing was misplaced.  In a year of overplayed, recycled films, this was a breath of fresh air.  Our characters were strong, yet independent.  I loved that Tonho wanted to leave, find a new hope, yet couldn't forget about his family, especially his younger brother.  I loved the sense of family and trust that happened within a small sect of people that really had nothing in common except the word ""family"" and the roof over their heads.  While the ending was sad, I saw it as the perfect wake up call for these two bickering families.  The scenery was genuine.  The music was somber.  Salles, in my eyes, couldn't have perfected ""Abril Despedacado"" any better.  I have seen some utter garbage this year, and while my eye for film is constantly changing with age, I think ""Abril Despedacado"" is one that families could enjoy, as well as anyone who found the courage to put this in their DVD player.  I am eager to see more of what Walter Salles has to offer, really explore his style, and suggest him thoroughly to friends and family.Overall, I am very impressed with this film.  It is one that could be watched again and again, and more could be discovered.  It is the perfect film to enjoy on a rainy day, with a warm cup of coffee, and enjoy the beauty that Salles creates with such a poignant family drama that obviously has a date on it, but can be considered universal.  Time has shown on this film, AND proven that ""Abril Despedacado"" is one that can sustain the test of time.

Little did I know how good this film was.  I didn't mind the subtitles because they were clear and non-complex.  I loved hearing the language.  I don't know; there's something mysteriously alluring about Portuguese; it has this smooth, almost rhythmic flavor about it.  I was thoroughly entertained by the little boy they called &quot;kid&quot; aka &quot;Puca&quot; (played by Ravi Ramos Lacerda);  he's basically a kid wanting to drown in the world of his fantasies but has to uphold these responsibilities of labor jus like the rest of his family.  I found him to be sweet, assertive, and pure comedy.  All the roles were praisingly convincing and held my attention the whole way through.  I couldn't get over how young Rodrigo looked even though the movie was taped but only two years ago.  hehe...young, but oh so adorable :o).  He doesn't say much, but...sometimes, words just aren't necessary.  Neways, I think the film's great.

If left at that, this would be a conceptually boring movie, one done hundreds of times in various locations for varying Hollywood budgets.  The glory of BEHIND THE SUN is in the presentation and transformation of a familiar precis into a visually stunning prolonged motion painting.  Director Salles has assembled a cast of beautiful actors, minimized the Portuguese dialog so that the visuals may convey the text almost solo, and has added appropriations from other art forms to make this a memorable film.  The only characters outside the feuding families are a traveling troupe of 'clowns' or a circus consisting of an older man and his senusously beautiful stepdaughter.  This nod to the ""I PAGLIACCI"" opera invests intrigue and introduces the concept of the redeeming force of love into this otherwise blighted life story of a young man doomed to die for family honor.  The photography is elegant, the acting is superb, the musical scoring is sensitively appropriate without drawing attention to itself.

They are struggling to make it in competition with a larger family up the road. The rivalry between the families grows into a blood feud. One day, the circus comes to town in the shape of a beautiful girl and her stepfather. The small family's oldest son falls in love with the girl and runs off with her on a last gasp of fun before he meets his fate as the feud's next target.The cinematography is great, with grand expressive shots of bloody shirts hanging on clotheslines and a memorable scene of a girl being twirled on a rope. There just isn't much story though, and what there is gets awfully confusing. ""Behind the Sun"" is a story about family rivalry, honor and love, but it made precious little sense to me.

The Breves family - husband, wife, and two sons - are hardscrabble sugar cane farmers. We don't really know what the Ferreira family does - perhaps they're ranchers. Both clans have waged a blood feud for generations over a wretched piece of land better bulldozed flat for a shopping mall. Considering the endless cycle of an eye for an eye, will Tonio, the oldest Breves son, live long enough to venture beyond his family's land and experience love before the bloodstains on that Ferreira shirt turn from red to yellow in the wind and sun?BEHIND THE SUN showcases actors that Americans have likely never seen before (and may never see again), but they're all excellent: Jos&eacute; Dumont as Tonio's father, Rita Assemany as his mother, Ravi Lacerda as his young brother (""The Kid""), Flavia Antonio as bewitching Clara of the traveling carnival, and Rodrigo Santoro as Tonio himself. Filmed in color, the movie depicts a physical landscape of magnificent austerity. Had it been in black and white, it would have been almost brutal.The film's thematic message, I think, is that embedded tribal conflicts based on ethnicity or religion or, in this case, some overblown concept of ""honor"", are almost impossible to resolve rationally and peacefully. And the film goes on to ask - and answer, in this particular storyline - the question of what must happen before the killing is to stop. My mild disenchantment with the theme of BEHIND THE SUN is the suspicion that it's been done previously many more times than I realize, most recently to my knowledge in the excellent film NO MAN'S LAND, which deals with a more contemporary antagonism. Moreover, the script reduces the problem of tribal conflict to the simplest scenario possible and thus oversimplifies the issue beyond everyday realities. However, in that it strips the issue down to the bone, so to speak, it does manage to admirably clarify the stupidity and tragedy of such discord.

Two families have a long standing feud and the film very early on shows us a dream sequence with the oldest son of the Breves family being ambushed and shot while carrying his youngest brother, ""kid,"" on his shoulders across an open field. The shirt of the victim is hung on a clothesline.  When the blood turns yellow, Tonio, the son next in line, will be required to ambush and kill the member of the rival Ferreira family who murdered his brother.Tonio carries out his assignment, kills his rival, and the stage is now set for the process to be repeated, seemingly in an endless cycle which will ultimately destroy both families.  Unfortunately, a misguided sense of honor has blinded both families to the stupidity and senselessness of the feud.Only the youngest brother of the Breves family, the kid, seems immune to the craziness of the longstanding feud.  He is a dreamer and we see him pouring over a book about the ocean given to him by circus performers who are on their way to the next town to set up their tent.  The fire-eater in the circus is a beautiful young woman and the kid's older brother Tonio falls in love with her at first sight.  This complicates matters because Tonio knows that he doesn't have much longer to live.  The rival family will kill him when the blood on the shirt of the man Tonio killed turns yellow.Except for brief moments at the circus, we experience the suffering of a family that has lost much and appears destined to lose even more.  The Breves family has no hope and no future because tradition and honor are more powerful than reason.  We don't have to look far to see counterparts everywhere today -- Northern Ireland, Palestine, Bosnia, etc.The climax of the film is heartbreakingly sad -- no Hollywood ending here.  The kid loves his brother Tonio and wants him to be happy.  He is a dreamer and he is willing to pay the price to make his dreams come true.  His dreams and sacrifice are a means of liberation for his brother and his family and an example for all of us.  We will not soon forget him.",4,Suffering and sadness lie Behind the Sun.,1062374400,"09 1, 2003",2003,2162,"['Sun', 'place', '1910', 'Brazilian', 'countryside', 'Even', 'so', 'movie', 'timeless', 'feel', 'Two', 'families', 'have', 'long', 'standing', 'feud', 'film', 'very', 'early', 'shows', 'dream', 'sequence', 'oldest', 'son', 'Breves', 'family', 'being', 'ambushed', 'shot', 'carrying', 'youngest', 'brother', 'kid', 'shoulders', 'open', 'field', 'shirt', 'victim', 'hung', 'clothesline', 'When', 'blood', 'yellow', 'Tonio', 'son', 'line', 'will', 'be', 'required', 'ambush', 'kill', 'member', 'rival', 'Ferreira', 'family', 'who', 'murdered', 'brother.Tonio', 'out', 'assignment', 'rival', 'stage', 'now', 'set', 'process', 'be', 'repeated', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'cycle', 'will', 'ultimately', 'destroy', 'families', 'Unfortunately', 'misguided', 'sense', 'honor', 'blinded', 'families', 'stupidity', 'senselessness', 'feud.Only', 'youngest', 'brother', 'Breves', 'family', 'kid', 'immune', 'craziness', 'longstanding', 'feud', 'dreamer', 'see', 'pouring', 'book', 'ocean', 'given', 'circus', 'performers', 'who', 'are', 'way', 'next', 'town', 'set', 'up', 'tent', 'fire-eater', 'circus', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'kid', 'older', 'brother', 'Tonio', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'matters', 'Tonio', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'longer', 'live', 'rival', 'family', 'will', 'kill', 'when', 'blood', 'shirt', 'man', 'Tonio', 'killed', 'turns', 'yellow.Except', 'brief', 'moments', 'circus', 'experience', 'suffering', 'family', 'lost', 'much', 'destined', 'lose', 'even', 'more', 'Breves', 'family', 'hope', 'future', 'tradition', 'honor', 'are', 'more', 'powerful', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'look', 'far', 'see', 'counterparts', 'everywhere', 'today', 'Northern', 'Ireland', 'Palestine', 'Bosnia', 'climax', 'film', 'heartbreakingly', 'sad', 'Hollywood', 'ending', 'here', 'kid', 'brother', 'Tonio', 'be', 'happy', 'dreamer', 'willing', 'pay', 'price', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'dreams', 'sacrifice', 'are', 'means', 'liberation', 'brother', 'family', 'example', 'will', 'not', 'soon', 'forget']",Behind The Sun

698853,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,B0000640VQ,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[3, 3]","Set among feuding sugarcane farmers in rural Brazil at the start of the last century, this film is in most respects a consistently beautiful achievement.  First of all, the spectacular photography, as astonishing on DVD as in the theater, is marked by a series of wonderfully lit or darkened barren and lush vistas of the sort which linger in the memory.  The acting, too, is noteworthy for the naturalness of most of the players, the older of whom have faces rightly savaged by the harshness of the vengeance code they uphold and the narrow meanness of their lives of quiet desperation.  The younger people in the film, eager for a life of more promise and joy than that offered by the declining sugar cane trade or itinerant circus performing, are to a person physically beautiful, yet frail and vulnerable to abuse, even early death, given the limited options their lives actually afford them.On the other hand, the film ,in my view, has a serious flaw, which is its dependence on the stereotypical character of the wise, unbelievably insightful pre-pubescent child not only to voice obvious truths none of the grown-ups see as quickly but also to provide the entirely predictable, essentially sentimental denouement.  With such astonishingly fresh realism marking the treatment of economic competition (i.e. the scene of price gouging at the sugar trading office) and family feuding (the appearance of the killer among the mourners at his victim's funeral) in the early and central parts of the film, the use of such a Hollywood or T.V.-style wise kid is both jarring and disappointing.",4,"""Mostly Beautiful""",1033171200,"09 28, 2002",2002,1590,"['Set', 'feuding', 'sugarcane', 'farmers', 'rural', 'Brazil', 'start', 'last', 'century', 'film', 'most', 'respects', 'consistently', 'beautiful', 'achievement', 'First', 'all', 'spectacular', 'photography', 'astonishing', 'DVD', 'theater', 'marked', 'series', 'wonderfully', 'lit', 'darkened', 'barren', 'lush', 'vistas', 'sort', 'linger', 'memory', 'acting', 'too', 'noteworthy', 'naturalness', 'most', 'players', 'older', 'whom', 'have', 'rightly', 'savaged', 'harshness', 'vengeance', 'code', 'uphold', 'narrow', 'meanness', 'lives', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'younger', 'people', 'film', 'eager', 'life', 'more', 'promise', 'joy', 'offered', 'declining', 'sugar', 'cane', 'trade', 'itinerant', 'circus', 'performing', 'are', 'person', 'physically', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'frail', 'vulnerable', 'abuse', 'even', 'early', 'death', 'given', 'limited', 'options', 'lives', 'actually', 'afford', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'view', 'serious', 'flaw', 'dependence', 'stereotypical', 'character', 'wise', 'unbelievably', 'insightful', 'pre-pubescent', 'child', 'not', 'only', 'voice', 'obvious', 'truths', 'none', 'grown-ups', 'see', 'quickly', 'also', 'provide', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'essentially', 'sentimental', 'denouement', 'such', 'astonishingly', 'fresh', 'realism', 'marking', 'treatment', 'economic', 'competition', 'i.e', 'scene', 'price', 'gouging', 'sugar', 'trading', 'office', 'family', 'feuding', 'appearance', 'killer', 'mourners', 'victim', 'funeral', 'early', 'central', 'parts', 'film', 'use', 'such', 'Hollywood', 'T.V.-style', 'wise', 'kid', 'jarring', 'disappointing']",Behind The Sun

It's a dirty western style film that takes place in the Brazil countryside in 1910. This film is about old fashion family land feuds and the way they were handled without intervention of the law. One son is killed and another must die. Cycle continues. This film works on many different levels because the story is as relevant today as it has ever been. The outcome is refreshing, timeless, sad, but also extremely thoughtful. Behind the Sun actually challenges the viewer to rise above old and questionable thought patterns that are in need of reevaluation.

698855,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000640VQ,Tsuyoshi,"[8, 8]","Striking images all around, 'Behind the Sun' shows how a good picture can let you smell the air of the place, the breath of the people.  Walter Salles ('Central Station' 'The Motorcycle Diaries') tells a story that resembles Greek dramas, with its simplicity and strength, but it is the picture's sheer beautiful visuals that makes 'Behind the Sun' a boon to every filmgoer.  In short, watch this.It's in 1910, in Brazil, in the middle of nowhere.  Two families are feuding with each other, according to their peculiar rules.  If one goes down, another member of the family revenges his death by killing the killer only.  Thus the life goes on.Among one of the family, we see the brothers -- younger Paku and elder Tonio.  They work hard to make sugar, using the old machine and two cows, with their silent sad-eyed mother and very strict father.  And the day finally comes when Tonio is ordered to kill: the spilled blood has turned yellow.The bloody cycle of death is briefly disturbed when a beautiful circus girl comes to the near town.  Or is it to be disturbed?  Will Tonio choose another way of life?  And what does Paku do?You may say the plot is melodramatic.  It is, sure, but the power of the story cannot be dismissed so easily.  Walter Salles succeeds in creating the atmosphere of the place, and despair and hope of the characters as well, all of which are so compelling.Also helped by the good acting from Rodrigo Santoro (in 'Love Actually' as Laura Linney's love), the film is about those characters and images. like 'Central Station.'  For all its slightly conventional storytelling (and very powerful one), 'Behind the Sun' remains a gripping experience all throughout.The story is inspired by a novel 'Broken April' written by Ismail Kadare.  The film changed the original's location (in Alvania) to Brazil, and was shot in the really desert places where the sun scorches from the deep blue sky onto the red rocks.  (It is said that the cast and crew had to travel from the nearest hotel to the location more than 200 km. everyday.)  And see Vinicius de Oliveira, as the family member rivalling Tonio's, who was the little boy in 'Central Station'",5,"Feuding Families, Brazil, 1910.
