First, Darshan has a more upbeat personality than some of the other dancers who teach tribal fusion type dance.  Second, the movements are simple and repeated slowly and then slightly faster - over and over.  When the movements are simple you feel more successful which keeps you motivated.  Third, the DVD is educational.  She explains and demonstrates the differences between 4 different types of tribal fusion styles. Fourth she is a wonderful dancer.  Fifth, the music really compliments the movements.  This DVD and the DVD by Ariellah will definitely teach beginners the basics of tribal bellydance technique.",5,Beginners CAN Learn Tribal Fusion!,1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,683,"['are', 'several', 'unique', 'characteristics', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'First', 'Darshan', 'more', 'upbeat', 'personality', 'other', 'dancers', 'who', 'teach', 'tribal', 'fusion', 'type', 'dance', 'Second', 'movements', 'are', 'simple', 'repeated', 'slowly', 'then', 'slightly', 'faster', 'over', 'When', 'movements', 'are', 'simple', 'feel', 'more', 'successful', 'motivated', 'Third', 'DVD', 'educational', 'differences', '4', 'different', 'types', 'tribal', 'fusion', 'styles', 'Fourth', 'wonderful', 'dancer', 'Fifth', 'music', 'really', 'movements', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'Ariellah', 'will', 'definitely', 'teach', 'beginners', 'basics', 'tribal', 'bellydance', 'technique']","Bellydance: Tribal Fusion NYC: Open level tribal fusion belly dance instruction, Belly dance classes"

Takes all the Rachel Brice stuff and really breaks it down, gives LOTS of choreography and a really long warmup/drill section that actually makes you feel like you've WORKED. I didn't care for the long, expository, talky bit at the beginning (she's not much of a public speaker) but the rest of the DVD was really good. Could have been lit a little better, the background is very dark sometimes, but that's not too important. I really like that she gives examples of 3 different styles here too.

This was one of their earlier efforts and suffers from terrible production.In many of the scenes, the image of Darshan is super-imposed over a digitalized backdrop.  Imagine small dancer image against spinning magenta or neon green spirals and trying to learn moves from that.  It is just plain hard on the eyes.  In fact, I watched this DVD once then gave it away b/c it literally hurt my eyes to watch.

1036708,A175N19FS2B4J,B000KZRP0S,Poppyx,"[1, 1]","One small complaint about this:  the way it is chaptered is confusing.  I didn't realize that there was a whole workout on this, until the third time I looked at it. 'Dance Workout' is in much smaller letters on the marquee than the combinations are, which makes you think that 'Dance Workout' is a title heading over 'Combinations', instead of a separate part of the DVD.That said, this is a really good just-past-beginner DVD.  Right now, I'm at the stage where I have been doing very beginner DVDs, specifically World Dance New York's, ""Luscious"" and Jillina's, ""Hip-Up-and-Shape-Out"",  which are beautiful absolute beginner DVDs.  I had also gone through the technique section of Ayshe's World Dance DVD, ""Bellydance for Core Fitness"", had been practicing with Sera's, ""Bellydance East Coast Tribal"", and had occasionally ventured into Ariellah's, ""Contemporary Bellydance and Yoga Conditioning.""So I started doing the, 'Workout' section of this, and thought, ""Hey, I know how to do those hip pops, that's on Ayshe's technique section.""  And, ""I know how to do the chest circles, Ariellah teaches that.""This is also great because it doesn't require huge amounts of endurance:  I'm almost forty, and I do a lot of Pilates, but I don't yet have some of the physical strength or speed of some of the other dancers I've seen, which makes practicing with them very frustrating.I could do almost all of this, and, watching Darshan's beautiful performance pieces, I felt like I was starting to be able to parse out what movement she was doing, all the while thinking, ""Wow, that's impressive dance.""If you're trying to teach yourself at home, and you want to move beyond very basic beginner, but you're frustrated with the more complicated DVDs, this is a really inspiring middle ground.",5,"Very, very good for just past beginner.",1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,1784,"['One', 'small', 'complaint', 'way', 'chaptered', 'confusing', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'was', 'whole', 'workout', 'third', 'time', 'looked', ""'Dance"", 'Workout', 'much', 'smaller', 'letters', 'marquee', 'combinations', 'are', 'think', ""'Dance"", 'Workout', 'title', 'heading', ""'Combinations"", 'instead', 'separate', 'part', 'DVD.That', 'said', 'really', 'good', 'just-past-beginner', 'DVD', 'Right', 'now', ""'m"", 'stage', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'very', 'beginner', 'DVDs', 'specifically', 'World', 'Dance', 'New', 'York', 'Luscious', 'Jillina', 'Hip-Up-and-Shape-Out', 'are', 'beautiful', 'absolute', 'beginner', 'DVDs', 'had', 'also', 'gone', 'technique', 'section', 'Ayshe', 'World', 'Dance', 'DVD', 'Bellydance', 'Core', 'Fitness', 'had', 'been', 'practicing', 'Sera', 'Bellydance', 'East', 'Coast', 'Tribal', 'had', 'occasionally', 'ventured', 'Ariellah', 'Contemporary', 'Bellydance', 'Yoga', 'Conditioning', 'So', 'started', 'doing', 'section', 'thought', 'Hey', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'hip', 'pops', 'Ayshe', 'technique', 'section', 'know', 'how', 'do', 'chest', 'circles', 'Ariellah', 'also', 'great', ""n't"", 'require', 'huge', 'amounts', 'endurance', ""'m"", 'almost', 'forty', 'do', 'lot', 'Pilates', 'do', ""n't"", 'yet', 'have', 'physical', 'strength', 'speed', 'other', 'dancers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'practicing', 'very', 'frustrating.I', 'could', 'do', 'almost', 'watching', 'Darshan', 'beautiful', 'performance', 'pieces', 'felt', 'was', 'starting', 'be', 'able', 'parse', 'out', 'what', 'movement', 'was', 'doing', 'while', 'thinking', 'Wow', 'impressive', 'dance', ""'re"", 'trying', 'teach', 'home', 'want', 'move', 'very', 'basic', 'beginner', ""'re"", 'frustrated', 'more', 'complicated', 'DVDs', 'really', 'inspiring', 'middle', 'ground']","Bellydance: Tribal Fusion NYC: Open level tribal fusion belly dance instruction, Belly dance classes"

She's alone in a basic black halter & black pants that you can easily see her legs to see how she moves. Includes a warm-up, posture exercises, poses, rib slides, circles, figure 8s, a little snake arms, hip bumps, omi, undulations both up & down (she explains it the best I've ever seen & I finally get it.) She teaches corners first, then builds to complex finish. She also has you do it slow several times & normal speed several times which was perfect. Enough to get muscle memory but not get tired/bored. She also doens't do a voice over & teaches you well with talking you through the move telling you which direction to move that & every body part. She doesn't just count like others which is great. There is always music playing, different styles in even the dance workout as time went on from modern to pacific island to middle eastern which helps although sometimes the music will have a fast temp which goes against her relaxed teaching in this section. She talk a little too much before/after instead of during the drill practice where you would be moving which is what you want. At first the slow pace killed me, but as time went on, she talked less & did more movements it was perfect.Combinations - 40 min (Contemporary, Tribaleque, World Tribal Fusion)Darshan is in a simple red/black pant/halter that you can still see her knees for movement. The background is all computer generated & looks like a beautifully colored STATIONARY graffiti brick/concrete wall that only changes for each new chapter dance style. Here she goes over the moves 1/2 speed a few times & then normal/fast speed several times while still telling you where to move your body. It build into a routine & she always has you practice each part of the routine on each side of the body before adding more. She was fast, to the point, but great drilling.Contemporary - 20 min - she uses mostly the moves covered in the workout section, very nice routine, very fluid music here had a slow beatTribaleque - 9 min - short routine of only undulations, chest lift, w/added shimmy walk, hip lifts & hip push backs (not taught in the workout section)World Tribal Fusion - 9 min - teaches only one samba style, a turn, pose, etc.Transitions - 2 min - teaches one horse stance transition w/some hip circles & drops for added workout music is very trance-like which put me to sleepPractice Combinations - 17 min???  - Shows Darshan showing all 3 combinations in a single routine done 2x in 1 min 10 seconds w/music that fades in/out with it as well. This chapter is reset many times for as long as you want to practicePerformance - 10 minDarshan in tribal style outfit/silver metal jewelry & metal top in a room with a simple black floor, black curtains behind her, well placed subtle colored lights & sunlight streaming in off camera most times from the large windows.I did feel my muscles being used/strengthening & I felt more control & learned a lot, but this isn't a cardio/sweat type of workout. I tend to like minimal/no instruction before/after each move & only details while you are doing the drills/practice instead of as an intro so that you're always moving. Darshan did a little too much intro instruction in the workout section, but talked less as time went on. She did give great detailed info that is the difference between an average dancer & a skillful/mesmerizing dancer. Some of the music was trance like which some like, but I need a fast/hard beat to keep me energized. Great for beginners who already know the basic movements of the popular belly dance steps & those looking for a little refinement, fluidity & body awareness.Intro/Welcome clip is on amazon & youtube.
