1305688,A3PHUMOFCIFUGF,B002ZG983M,Alexander Liu,"[5, 7]","It hurts to be a hero. Bad guys have knives, good guys cause collateral damage, and the general public simply doesn't care. But it is ridiculously fun to watch how all this plays out in Kick-Ass, with someone else taking the hurt for us.It is a simple story of a teenager (Aaron Johnson) so enamored with the fictional exploits of his comic-book heroes that he decides to become one. As Kick-Ass, what Dave Lizewski lacks in super-powers, he makes up for with two batons and lot of good intentions. Eventually, Lizewski finds aid and conflict in the form of two brutal vigilantes, Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), and the three set out to end the reign of a local crime boss (Mark Strong), who just so happens to be the father of an unlikely ally.Indeed, `Kick-Ass' plays almost like an overlong homage to Spiderman: Alienated youth? Check. Unrequited love? Check. A friend with a murderous father? Check. However, whereas the tale of Spiderman, tragic as it may be, remains grounded in the realm of rose-tinted spandex, Kick-Ass chooses to dig deeper into the pathos, exploring the harsh realities of being a caped crusader in an all too familiar, disillusioned society.Ironically, as the titular character, Johnson turns in what may very well be the picture's most forgettable performance. Forced to bumble around, jovially getting his `ass kicked', Johnson is less Peter Sellers than he is an even more depressing Peter Parker.That isn't to say that Johnson doesn't acquit himself well enough, but honestly, could any man ever be expected to top Cage's eccentricity? With an Adam West impersonation of `Big Daddy', and a Don Knotts rendition for alter ego Damon Macready, perhaps the only time we really get to see Cage being his bizarre self is in a tragic, yet unintentionally hysterical scene, where Cage begins screaming (or is it singing?) unintelligible commands. Look up at the screen! Is he in pain? Is he in ecstasy? It's Nicolas Cage!So leave it to a little girl to steal Cage's limelight. Turning in a career-making performance as the cutesy and murderous child-fatale, Moretz does for `Kick-Ass' what Yoda's unexpected martial artistry did for the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Unabashedly violent and vulgar, Moretz may be very well be the youngest anti-hero of this, or any generation. That is not to say that it's hard to root for her. Indeed, Moretz may be the film's biggest draw even if for those very reasons alone!Certainly, one won't be watching `Kick-Ass' for its borrowed visuals. It's too bad that director Matthew Vaughn chose not to further define his relatively new visual style, opting instead to mimic a nouveau Tarantino, and by extension, the expressions of many a Japanese and Spaghetti-Western director. Even the music, with its adrenaline pumping surf beats and kitschy tunes, seems an all too familiar experience, going as far to include a redressed track from '28 Days Later'.Still, it is understandable, considering that the plot and characterizations mostly stand on borrowed legs, so too would the stylistic choices of the film. Otherwise, `Kick-Ass' rarely fails to disappoint, and as a parable on the dangers of being a hero in a world of red, `Kick-Ass' really does kick ass.",5,Kick-Ass Kicks Ass!,1274227200,"05 19, 2010",2010,3238,"['be', 'hero', 'Bad', 'guys', 'have', 'knives', 'good', 'guys', 'cause', 'collateral', 'damage', 'general', 'public', 'simply', ""n't"", 'care', 'ridiculously', 'fun', 'watch', 'how', 'out', 'Kick-Ass', 'someone', 'else', 'taking', 'hurt', 'us.It', 'simple', 'story', 'teenager', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'so', 'enamored', 'fictional', 'exploits', 'comic-book', 'heroes', 'become', 'one', 'Kick-Ass', 'what', 'Dave', 'Lizewski', 'super-powers', 'up', 'two', 'batons', 'lot', 'good', 'intentions', 'Eventually', 'Lizewski', 'aid', 'conflict', 'form', 'two', 'brutal', 'vigilantes', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'three', 'set', 'out', 'end', 'reign', 'local', 'crime', 'boss', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'father', 'unlikely', 'ally.Indeed', 'Kick-Ass', 'almost', 'overlong', 'homage', 'Spiderman', 'Alienated', 'youth', 'Check', 'Unrequited', 'love', 'Check', 'friend', 'murderous', 'father', 'Check', 'However', 'tale', 'Spiderman', 'tragic', 'may', 'be', 'grounded', 'realm', 'rose-tinted', 'spandex', 'Kick-Ass', 'dig', 'deeper', 'pathos', 'exploring', 'harsh', 'realities', 'being', 'caped', 'crusader', 'too', 'familiar', 'disillusioned', 'society.Ironically', 'titular', 'character', 'Johnson', 'what', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'picture', 'most', 'forgettable', 'performance', 'Forced', 'bumble', 'around', 'jovially', 'getting', 'ass', 'kicked', 'Johnson', 'less', 'Peter', 'Sellers', 'even', 'more', 'depressing', 'Peter', 'Parker.That', ""n't"", 'say', 'Johnson', ""n't"", 'acquit', 'well', 'enough', 'honestly', 'could', 'man', 'ever', 'be', 'expected', 'top', 'Cage', 'eccentricity', 'Adam', 'West', 'impersonation', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Don', 'Knotts', 'rendition', 'alter', 'ego', 'Damon', 'Macready', 'perhaps', 'only', 'time', 'really', 'get', 'see', 'Cage', 'being', 'bizarre', 'self', 'tragic', 'yet', 'unintentionally', 'hysterical', 'scene', 'where', 'Cage', 'screaming', 'singing', 'unintelligible', 'commands', 'Look', 'up', 'screen', 'pain', 'ecstasy', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'So', 'leave', 'little', 'girl', 'steal', 'Cage', 'limelight', 'Turning', 'career-making', 'performance', 'cutesy', 'murderous', 'child-fatale', 'Moretz', 'Kick-Ass', 'what', 'Yoda', 'unexpected', 'martial', 'artistry', 'did', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequel', 'trilogy', 'Unabashedly', 'violent', 'vulgar', 'Moretz', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'youngest', 'anti-hero', 'generation', 'not', 'say', 'hard', 'root', 'Indeed', 'Moretz', 'may', 'be', 'film', 'biggest', 'draw', 'even', 'very', 'reasons', 'alone', 'Certainly', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'watching', 'Kick-Ass', 'borrowed', 'visuals', 'too', 'bad', 'director', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'chose', 'not', 'further', 'define', 'relatively', 'new', 'visual', 'style', 'opting', 'instead', 'mimic', 'nouveau', 'Tarantino', 'extension', 'expressions', 'many', 'Japanese', 'Spaghetti-Western', 'director', 'Even', 'music', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'surf', 'beats', 'kitschy', 'tunes', 'too', 'familiar', 'experience', 'going', 'far', 'include', 'redressed', 'track', ""'28"", 'Days', ""Later'.Still"", 'understandable', 'considering', 'plot', 'characterizations', 'mostly', 'stand', 'borrowed', 'legs', 'so', 'too', 'would', 'stylistic', 'choices', 'film', 'Otherwise', 'Kick-Ass', 'rarely', 'disappoint', 'parable', 'dangers', 'being', 'hero', 'world', 'red', 'Kick-Ass', 'really', 'kick', 'ass']",N/A

Don't get me wrong, Iron Man 2 is a VERY close second, but ""Kick-Ass"" bests it simply because of its ability to be both serious and laugh at itself (not taking itself too seriously); in other words, what all Marvel movies try to do, but usually fail.In Alan Moore's masterpiece graphic novelWatchmen, Hollis Mason (the original Nite Owl) stated that the reason people started dressing up as costumed crimefighters was because of the criminals dressing in themed costumes, hence the superhero was born. InThe Dark Knight (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray] film, Heath Ledger's Joker menacingly taunts Batman, stating: ""Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were. But I know the truth: there's no going back. You've changed things... forever."" And from there, we know that Batman has inspired this new cache of supervillains in his world. Well, it's with that same inspiration that a lonely teenager Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) asks, ""How come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero?"" From there begins a realistic, violent-yet-comic story of his attempt to become just that: a superhero called Kick-Ass.What starts off as ""Kick-Ass"" just trying to clean up the streets becomes a tale of a scared kid who's in above his head as he tries to avoid getting caught in the crosshairs of every hitman's gun under the orders of a mob boss (Mark Strong). Fumbling his way through his crimefighting career, Lizewski crosses paths with Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit-Girl (the EXCELLENT Chloe Moretz), other vigilante crimefighters who make him look like what he is: an amateur. Along the way, he also meets a friend (similar to James Franco's Harry Osborn in the Spider-Man films), Chris D'Amico (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse), and further develops his crush on Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca).There's been plenty of criticism about the film since it's release having to do with the supposed insult of Lizewski's dad being afraid that his son was gay; because that would be such a bad thing for a father to have to face (and yes, I'm being sarcastic with that statement). And the idea of Chloe Moretz's Hit-Girl being seen as a sex symbol as some moviegoers repeat a statement one of the characters, seeing her in action, declares, ""I think I'm in love with her!"" The ""gay controversy"" was reported by Entertainment Weekly. First of all, let's get this straightened out, Lizewski's dad in the film is scared by the idea that his son was prostituting himself, stripped naked and robbed ... not the mere fact that he was gay. Second, there will be boys who find Hit-Girl's dominating action as a turn-on, and that is disturbing, given her age (11-years-old). But, being as I'm not someone who views that as ""hot,"" but rather just as really cool, that aspect therefore doesn't enter my mind and doesn't affect the quality of the movie in the slightest. To all the naysayers, I say, ""Lighten up."" It's a film about a kid who poses as a superhero. It's to be taken with a grain of salt. Besides, would there be so much ""controversy"" if it were a boy who was kicking ass and shooting guns and cussing like a sailor? Also, in a world where there are very few young female crimefighters, Hit-Girl -- despite her age -- could be seen as a role model. She's tough, independent and completely confident. But more on her in a second.Nevertheless, there are true themes of morality that pepper the story of Kick-Ass. The ever-present theme of ""With great power, comes great responsibility"" is tackled in various incarnations throughout. Let's revisit Hit-Girl and her double life. Damon Macready/Big Daddy's (Cage) quest for revenge on the death of his wife and the pathologically violent path it's taken his daughter Mindy Macready (Moretz) down is explored with great depth, as is the hazard of posing as a crimefighter/policeman/detective/etc. in a job that is extremely dangerous. The violence is plentiful and stylized as much as it is brutal and unforgiving. The question of a little girl crimefighter/vigilante is not ""Does she have the right?"" but rather is, ""Should a little girl of eleven-years-old be subjected to such violence?"" Well, first of all, again, it's a movie based on a comic book so it's whatever the writers want it to be. Secondly, if this were the real world (and being a father of two daughters), then no, she shouldn't be raised in such a matter. And the end of the film comes up with a way to address this issue. Either way, with the movies Moretz has been involved with ((500) Days of Summer [Blu-ray] with Digital Copyand the upcoming U.S. remake ofLet the Right One In [Blu-ray] entitled ""Let Me In""), she shows great potential as an actress.Overall, ""Kick-Ass"" is a fun film! It's got very adult situations (violence, language and a quicky sex scene thrown in for good measure), but from its dark humor beginning to its sequel-potential ending, Matthew Vaughn's adaptation of Mark Millar's (Wanted) comic hits all the right chords. I was skeptical about Mintz-Plasse's portrayal of Red Mist, but he surprisingly played the part convincingly and believably. For fans of the comic who read the comic before seeing the movie (as I did), there are slight differences near the end -- that I can only think for the reason of satisfying the moviegoing masses -- that were changed. However, these changes don't greatly alter the quality of the story. It's been said there will already be a sequel based on Millar's second half of the comic series tentatively called ""Balls to the Wall."" Unfortunately, Millar won't be releasing that series for at least another year or so. Until then, the DVD release of ""Kick-Ass"" will have to suffice!",5,Well ... the name says it all!,1276128000,"06 10, 2010",2010,5751,"['briefly', 'summarize', 'Kick-Ass', 'best', 'comic', 'book',

When Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) utters that line, I am instantly hooked.  I tried to be a superhero in high school by defending those who could not defend themselves, but I never had a costume or cool alias.  Kick-Ass (a.k.a. Dave Lizewski) is a teenage vigilante who becomes an internet sensation as a masked superhero.  His crusade attracts the attention of Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big-Daddy (Nicholas Cage) who join forces to fight the powerful gangster, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong).This is a fast-paced, action-packed film that is a visual feast for the eyes with colorful costumes and brilliantly choreographed fight scenes.  The grotesquely violent scenes are portrayed in a satirical manner making them quite enjoyable to watch.  The music selection is an essential component by adding impact to high-voltage action scenes as well as depth to emotional scenes.An eclectic cast of characters adds to the film's appeal because they are relatable and enviable.  Hit-Girl (a.k.a., Mindy Macready) is absolutely the best part of this movie.  She is a pint-sized, powerful avenger who slings guns, knives and vulgarity with ease.  All of this is done under the watchful eye of her doting father, Big-Daddy (a.k.a. Damon Macready).  The relationship between Mindy and her father is heartwarming, albeit unconventional.  There is something endearing and disturbingly funny about a little girl whose daddy teaches her how to take a bullet in the chest.Despite all the blood and violence there are some touching moments.  This is a film about finding your true identity, breaking out of your comfort zone and taking extreme risk to earn great rewards.  Kick-Ass is a cult classic that will have devoted fans for decades.

What do you expect when you are a high school dork with only a $200 budget? His next step, a name...Kick-Ass or as Big Daddy (Cage) says ""more like Ass-Kick""! Of course Kick-Ass has no powers, no skills, no smarts and no cool gadgets but he still inspires NY'ers once his beating by 3 thugs becomes viral on YouTube. His life is now changed by having his own comic book and copy cats. It all seems pretty cool, until he is implicated as the vigilante that is taking down D'Amico's (Strong) drug empire! Now, he is hunted by violent criminals and meets up with a pair of real crazed vigilantes, including an 11-year-old weapons wielding dynamo, Hit Girl (Moretz) and her father, Big Daddy. Kick-Ass eventually learns that the duo have their own score to settle with D'Amico. As obsession turns into madness, Kick-Ass is forced to become a real hero or die!Kudos to everyone involved on this project (both the comic and the film)! Millar's story and Romita's drawings inspired Matt Vaughn's vision and the result is a cult classic that will be loved by comic fanboys and it's own subculture for decades.

Fans of Leon the Professional will immediately pick up the relationship with Moretz and Cage as it is similar to Portman and Reno. The film is dark and although there is comedy, it can be uncomfortable. Ultimately, once the ""Ass-Kickin'"" starts, you will be cheering with every dead bad guy! A must see.BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: A beautiful picture with outstanding sound. The colors pop and the blacks are rich. Blu-ray has made the home theatre experience so much better. SPECIAL FEATURES: Fantastic, although I would have loved deleted scenes. The two best features are long and include a making of and the origins of the comic book. FINAL THOUGHTS: I loved this movie. Comic book fans will jump all over it. Blu ray collectors should add this as well. Casual fans? Once you see it, you will love it too. A MUST OWN!",4,"""Mindy, no more homework, Babydoll.

The lead character asks his friends why no one has ever donned a superhero outfit to fight crime. His friends tell him that it's a crazy idea. The only man they can think of who tried something like that was a schizophrenic who fell to his death trying to fly.Later on, however, it becomes clear that the movie is taking place within a comic book. A little costumed girl (""Hit Girl"") dodges bullets, takes out drug dealers with throwing knives, and goes toe-to-toe with an adult male. This could only happen in a comic book, or a movie based on one.At first the movie appears to be set in a reality where superheroes only exist in comic books. But when the Hit Girl character is introduced, it's almost as if the characters get sucked into a parallel universe. The costumed characters start pulling off improbable stunts and the storyline loses all touch with logical reality. This wheels within wheels narrative annoyed me, but it wasn't enough to make me hate the movie.What made me hate Kick Ass was the Hit Girl character. She cusses, she kills, she ventures into drug dens, all under the watchful eye of her father. This is supposed to be funny. The audience is supposed to laugh at this. Apparently, Hit Girl's gruesome antics are supposed to be a satire of something. If it's satire, it's satire so subtle that no one can explain it.When you criticize a movie like Kick Ass you're accused of ""missing the point""; somehow, the vulgarity and crassness is the ""point"" of the movie, making it impossible to say anything negative about it. Of course, there's nothing satirical here.If you like Kick Ass, fine, but don't call it satire. Call it a guilty pleasure, call it mindless entertainment, call it a comic book movie, whatever. It can be all of those things, but it's definitely not satire.

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[0, 0]","4.5 out of 5Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), comic book geek and nobody-at-large, always wondered why no one stepped up and became a superhero. People aspire to be doctors and firemen and policemen, so why not also want to be someone else who helped his fellow man?After ordering a green and yellow wetsuit off the Internet, Dave dons the outfit and hits the streets as Kick-Ass, a superhero without powers, training or even a proper motivation to fight crime other than ""what if?"" The first few weeks are uneventful, and after his first attempt at stopping a car robbery nearly kills him, Dave returns more determined than ever to rid the streets of crime. Soon, after stopping the mugging of a fellow from a gang, Kick-Ass is all over the Internet and soon becomes a citywide celebrity.Little does he realize he's not alone. Enter Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), a father-daughter team of real-deal vigilantes with a thirst for blood and matching guns to boot. Their mission? Take out the D'Amico crime family, their leader, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), having been personally involved with Big Daddy long ago and robbing him of the one he loved.Soon Kick-Ass, Big Daddy, Hit Girl and newcomer Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) are locked in a war that, hopefully, only the good guys survive.It's guns, action, comic books and bubble gum in this adaptation of Mark Millar and John Romita Jr.'s graphic novel.This movie is crazy. A good crazy. A special kind of crazy. I knew from the previews I was in for a different kind of superhero flick and, man, that was what I got. This was fresh, exciting, fun and new. Most superhero movies stick to a formula (origin of the good guy then the bad guy, a few tussles along the way leading to a big fight in the end, the stuff in between usually dramatic bits starring the hero in his personal life). With Kick-Ass, though there were those basic elements to it, the one thing that was really hammered home over and over again was the idea that, yeah, Kick-Ass was functioning in the real world. One with guns, knives, average fighting skills and no body armor. Some folks might think the violence in this film was overdone. Personally--despite a few exceptions--I didn't think so. You try doing the superhero thing in real life in a place like New York and see what happens.I also really liked how they dragged that fantasy of being a superhero into our reality and proved, really, that it wouldn't work. Kick-Ass went up against real bad guys. Ones without mercy. Without care. They'd kill their own mothers if they had to.The lack of a costumed supervillain also helped this movie and ensured the focus was kept on the good guys. I particularly liked Big Daddy's and Hit Girl's origin. It was simple, yet bittersweet and, if anything, really showed that despite being off his rocker, Big Daddy really loved his little girl and only wanted the best for her.In terms of the non-costumed scenes, Dave Lizewski's real life was extremely relatable (especially for this comic book nerd) and his high school years and mine seemed to have a lot in common. Except for the girlfriend part. I wasn't cool enough to have one of those.This movie was fantastic start to finish. The writing, the action, the realism--true cool.My only thing was the profanity. I don't live in New York, but that was a lot of swearing and if people really talk like that in NYC, man, I feel sorry from them. (But, hey, I'm just a Maple Syrup-guzzling Canadian so what do I know?) If they don't, perhaps the writers can pull back a bit on the wagging tongue for the next one.Looking forward to the sequel.A.P.

1305710,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B002ZG983M,Armando N. Roman,"[1, 1]","These days, it feels like you can't go 3 months without a movie based on a comic coming out. Usually they're the superhero kind, and other times you get something completely different like Oldboy or Sin City. I've never been a big fan of the superhero genre of comics or movies, apart from the ones that were meant to be entertaining and no much else. Kick-Ass didn't seem very interesting when I saw the trailer for it, and I hadn't read the comic either. I just watched the movie last night, and I think I'll be ordering the comic pretty soon because the movie sure won me over. Kick-Ass has just about everything I want in a good movie, and while there were two things toward the end that killed the moment for me, I have to say that it's one of the better movies I've seen this year.Dave Lizewski is your average high school geek. He has no luck with the ladies, fantasizes about his [totally stacked] teacher Mrs. Zane, isn't even the funny one in his small group of friends, and spends most of his time at the comic shop or online. To make matters worse, he's constantly being robbed by two hoodlums in the neighborhood. During one robbing session, he notices someone observing the situation from their window. Rather than come down and help or call the police, the person does nothing, and this irritates Dave to the point of wanting to make a difference. He orders a scuba diver suit that looks kinda superhero-y, gets a baton for a weapon, and makes it his goal to become a local superhero: Kick-Ass. And wouldn't you know it, he just so happens to encounter the hoodlums pretty soon after getting his outfit. Things...don't go as well as he'd like, though he was off to a great start, and Dave gets stabbed AND run over, accidentally, by someone else who just drives off without helping him. The poor kid ends up in the hospital and comes out with messed up nerve endings and some enhanced bones. Rather than give up, he continues with the Kick-Ass thing and when he finally manages to bring justice to someone being beat up by 3 big dudes, it gets recorded and goes up on the internet, making him an instant star. But at the same time, there's a rumor going around of someone who looks like Batman...or just a superhero...messing up a local mob kingpin's business. Yep, Kick-Ass is in over his head, and it's going to take some people with much better training than him to set things right.I was impressed by how well comedy, drama and action were all mixed together in Kick-Ass. The first quarter of the movie is comical, the middle is action-packed, and the final part has a lot of action with drama while still knowing when to throw in some humor. And my god was I happy to see that they had him fighting like someone who didn't know what they were doing and just brawling to their heart's content. I hate fights in movies that -look- like choreographed fights (think Tron Legacy's god-awful bar/club fight), but nearly everything here looked good. Even more amazing was Nicholas Cage giving a performance that wasn't bad. In fact, this could be the best thing I've seen him do in years. He does a terrific job as the Big Daddy character: a nice blend of loving father and revenge-driven psycho. Who knew? But, I have to agree with the majority here, when I say that the real winner of the movie is Hit-Girl. A little girl who isn't even a tween, cussing up a storm and literally shredding bad guys to bits with double bladed staffs, knives and more. Somehow, her character fits into the world of Kick-Ass, which sounds silly on paper but when you see it for yourself, it works. Had the movie been just about Kick-Ass himself, it probably would've gotten stale with the whole awkward superhero thing. Leave it to Big Daddy and Hit-Girl to keep things moving along just nicely. There isn't much else I can rave about without ruining some plot points. The cast and acting is solid all-around, even from Mark Strong and Mr. McLovin.It's too bad that the final act is, in my eyes, underwhelming thanks to the big reveal of something Big Daddy and Hit-Girl order. Not that what I was expecting was much better, but when it's showtime, my shoulders drooped and I was let down severely. The climax is ruined even more by the use of a weapon. I won't say what, but when it's used, man...had that happened earlier on, I might have just turned the movie off because it was such an easy way to end things. So much for a big finish. And yes, I know this is a comic book movie, so it might've worked better in the comic, but on the big screen it looks goofy. Sorry.Despite the below average climax, I had a good time watching it, and will be buying it sometime in the future. Kick-Ass deserves the money it earned in theaters (nearly 100m worldwide), and earns the R rating it has. How often do you see an action movie that could've been PG-13 if not for a few profanities? If you're sick of Spider-Man or like your heroes a little more realistic, go with Kick-Ass.Once again, big props to Mrs. Zane.",4,A comic book movie worth watching.,1335744000,"04 30,

Be it w/ guns or knives she is the victor. Don't get me wrong everyone else did their fair share of butt kickin' but she was by far the best. A suprerhero w/o ANY powers at all just a need to be something/someonelse who makes a difference. You get to see what happens when an average guy puts on a suit and fights ""crime"" for the 1st time.

So, one day he buys a costume, puts it on, and then goes out to fight crime.There are a lot of things to like about the movie.

1305726,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B002ZG983M,B. Martin,"[1, 12]","The problem that I have with Kick-Ass isn't that it is relentlessy violent (albeit in an over the top, almost cartoonish manner), overflowing with profanity or even that one of the main characters is an 11 year old girl who slices and dices crooks and bad guys with a child like sense of glee.  No, what I found to be most disappointing about this big screen adaptation of the graphic novel (which I've never read) is that it is not as darkly funny, satirical, shocking or cool as it thinks it is.  In fact, I was fairly bored with the majority of the movie.  I guess I just don't get it.Kick-Ass tells the story of Dave Lizewski, a typical teenager who thinks that it might be cool to become a costumed crime fighter.  Dave tells us via voice over narration, that he doesn't have any real reason to carry out this plan other than it is a fantasy that he thinks would be fun to play out.  He is not driven by any of the reasons that so frequently occur in comic books.  He doesn't have the need to avenge the death of his parents, he wasn't exposed to any radioactive materials and he is not an angry outcast.  As he tells us, he is pretty much a normal teenager.That is certainly an interesting hook to build the movie around, and I had hope early on that this would make for an engrossing and unique film.  But as it turns out, that is not the case.  Don't get me wrong, Kick-Ass is certainly trying to provoke thought and discussion about subjects such as our youtube obsessed culture and how it can turn anyone into an overnight sensation, and the dangers of living in a fantasy world. But it just never sucks you into the comic book world it so meticulously creates.The perils of severing ties with reality is illustrated in the movie by the presence of a father-daughter crime fighting duo known as Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage in a corny Bat-Man suit) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz).  These two team up with Dave's newly created superhero, Kick-Ass, after they save him from being slaughtered by some very real, very dangerous bad guys.  Cage's Big Daddy is a former cop who has turned his life into a comic book/video game where the goal is to take down the drug kingpin who framed him and sent him to prison which ultimately resulted in his wife's suicide.  It seems that in order to cope with his grief and loss, Cage's character has created a fantasy world where he fights crime.  One of the consequences of his break with reality is that he has pulled his daughter into the abyss with him, turning her into a vicious killing machine.  Big Daddy has even written a comic book that chronicles the events that set him on his current path.  Clearly he can't face the reality of what has happened to him.The movie even casts a critical eye on its audience as well since it almost dares us to cheer Hit Girl on as she amasses an unfathomable body count.  Have we become so desensitized to violence by comic books and video games (there is one fight scene in which Hit Girl takes out a team of gangsters while wearing night vision goggles that was very reminiscent of many first person shooter video games that I've played) that we have no problem accepting the scenario of a child committing heinous murders, or is it all just intended to be darkly humorous in the vein of a Quentin Tarantino movie?The answer that I arrived at was that I didn't really care because the movie was not worth putting that much thought into.  It is largely devoid of humor, true satirical bite and most importantly, entertainment value.  In the end, it was not unlike many ultraviolent video games that I've played:  noisy and forgettable.",2,It doesn't live up to it's title,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,3618,"['problem', 'have', 'Kick-Ass', ""n't"", 'relentlessy', 'violent', 'top', 'almost', 'cartoonish', 'manner', 'overflowing', 'profanity', 'even', 'one', 'main', 'characters', '11', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'dices', 'crooks', 'bad', 'guys', 'child', 'sense', 'glee', 'No', 'what', 'found', 'be', 'most', 'disappointing', 'big', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'graphic', 'novel', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'not', 'darkly', 'funny', 'satirical', 'shocking', 'cool', 'fact', 'was', 'fairly', 'bored', 'majority', 'movie', 'guess', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.Kick-Ass', 'tells', 'story', 'Dave', 'Lizewski', 'typical', 'teenager', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'cool', 'become', 'costumed', 'crime', 'fighter', 'Dave', 'voice', 'narration', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'reason', 'carry', 'out', 'plan', 'other', 'fantasy', 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'play', 'out', 'not', 'driven', 'reasons', 'so', 'frequently', 'occur', 'comic', 'books', ""n't"", 'have', 'need', 'avenge', 'death', 'parents', 'was', ""n't"", 'exposed', 'radioactive', 'materials', 'not', 'angry', 'outcast', 'pretty', 'much', 'normal', 'teenager.That', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'hook', 'build', 'movie', 'had', 'hope', 'early', 'would', 'make', 'engrossing', 'unique', 'film', 'out', 'not', 'case', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Kick-Ass', 'certainly', 'trying', 'provoke', 'thought', 'discussion', 'subjects', 'such', 'youtube', 'obsessed', 'culture', 'how', 'can', 'turn', 'anyone', 'overnight', 'sensation', 'dangers', 'living', 'fantasy', 'world', 'just', 'never', 'comic', 'book', 'world', 'so', 'meticulously', 'creates.The', 'perils', 'severing', 'ties', 'reality', 'illustrated', 'movie', 'presence', 'father-daughter', 'crime', 'fighting', 'duo', 'known', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'corny', 'Bat-Man', 'suit', 'Hit-Girl', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'two', 'team', 'Dave', 'newly', 'created', 'superhero', 'Kick-Ass', 'save', 'being', 'slaughtered', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'dangerous', 'bad', 'guys', 'Cage', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'former', 'cop', 'who', 'turned', 'life', 'comic', 'book/video', 'game', 'where', 'goal', 'take', 'down', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'who', 'framed', 'sent', 'prison', 'ultimately', 'resulted', 'wife', 'suicide', 'order', 'cope', 'grief', 'loss', 'Cage', 'character', 'created', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'crime', 'One', 'consequences', 'break', 'reality', 'pulled', 'daughter', 'abyss', 'turning', 'vicious', 'killing', 'machine', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'even', 'written', 'comic', 'book', 'events', 'set', 'current', 'path', 'Clearly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'face', 'reality', 'what', 'happened', 'him.The', 'movie', 'even', 'critical', 'eye', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'almost', 'cheer', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'unfathomable', 'body', 'count', 'Have', 'become', 'so', 'desensitized', 'violence', 'comic', 'books', 'video', 'games', 'one', 'fight', 'scene', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'out', 'team', 'gangsters', 'wearing', 'night', 'vision', 'goggles', 'was', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'many', 'first', 'person', 'shooter', 'video', 'games', ""'ve"", 'played', 'have', 'problem', 'accepting', 'scenario', 'child', 'committing', 'heinous', 'murders', 'just', 'intended', 'be', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'vein', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'movie', 'answer', 'arrived', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'worth', 'putting', 'much', 'thought', 'largely', 'devoid', 'humor', 'true', 'satirical', 'bite', 'most', 'importantly', 'entertainment', 'value', 'end', 'was', 'not', 'many', 'ultraviolent', 'video', 'games', ""'ve"", 'played', 'noisy', 'forgettable']",N/A

I wanted something over the top and fast paced.  Instead, ""Kick-Ass,"" while certainly over the top, is not fast paced at all.  Rather, it is two completely different movies shoehorned into one, that are only tied together at the very end.  The first movie is the story of a schlubby teen who becomes Kick-Ass out of a love of comic books and sense of idealism.  The second movie is the story of Big Daddy and his daughter Hit Girl, who are far more successful superheroes.  Oddly, the story of Kick-Ass is less serious than the story of Big Daddy and Hit Girl.  ""Kick-Ass"" suffers from jarring tonal shifts as well as a very slow moving first act.  If you can wade through the first 20-30 minutes, the better stuff kicks in.However, at 2 hours this movie was too long for its own good.  The length is attributable to the fact that there are two different jammed-together stories to tell.  Paradoxically, even with the 2-hour length, the narrative seems thin and not fully fleshed out.Hit Girl is awesome, and is without a doubt the best part of this movie.  I would have preferred that the movie be called ""Hit Girl"" and that it was 90 minutes with her.

I loved the Chris Nolan Batman films,The Watchmen, Iron Man, and the first 2 Spider-man films, but I didn't know anything about Kick-Ass when it came out in theaters. Only one of my friends had seen it, and I didn't hear any buzz about this film except the mainstream press criticizing it for its gratuitous violence. I was turned off by the ugly poster art and poor marketing, thinking it was some cheesy knock-off of the Watchmen.Boy, was I wrong. Having just watched it, I can definitely say it's one of my favorite films of 2010. It's an entertaining and suspenseful action movie with lots of guns and tons of violence. It's an anti-hero movie. The main character, Dave, sucks at being a superhero. He's just an ordinary high school kid with a dumb green costume made out of a wetsuit he bought online. The only thing he has going is an extraordinary ability to get his ass beaten on a regular basis because of his gross lack of fighting skills. A third of the way into the film, he is saved from certain death by two real superheroes, Big Daddy and Hit Girl and their story arcs converge. Big Daddy (who dresses like Batman/Night Owl) and Hit Girl are father and daughter, two highly-skilled vigilantes out to settle a personal score with drug kingpin Frank D'Amico. Nick Cage, who I'm not normally fond of, I liked in this film as Big Daddy. 13 year old Chloe Moretz plays Hit Girl. She is both adorable and deadly. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is as annoying as ever.Visually, Kick-Ass is superb. It's stylish and super-violent in the same way that the Watchmen was violent and stylish (but not nearly as violent asNinja Assasin). Lots of people die in fancy, inventively-choreographed and cleverly shot ways. There's a ridiculously over-the-top John Woo-styled clip reloading/gun catching sequence and a mini-gun/jet-pack at the end, but it's all in good fun. Gun geeks will also drool over all the hardware hanging in Big Daddy's safe room and the SMAW (shoulder-launched rocket). Lots of blood. Lots of stabbings. One guy even gets blown up in a microwave. If you don't like violence, stay far away from this movie.Story-wise, Kick-Ass shares many similarities with the Nolan Batman films, The Watchmen, Spider-man, andL&eacute;on: The Professionalin that the heroes are human and fallible. The film takes place in Brooklyn and other parts of New York City, but it's quite obvious from the locations that it was shot elsewhere (Toronto, Canada) for budgetary reasons.If you enjoyed any of the films I've mentioned in this review, you'll probably enjoy Kick-Ass too.",5,This movie KICKS ASS!,1279843200,"07 23, 2010",2010,2606,"[""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'superhero', 'movies', 'loved', 'Chris', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'films', 'Watchmen', 'Iron', 'Man', 'first', '2', 'Spider-man', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Kick-Ass', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'Only', 'one', 'friends', 'had', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'buzz', 'film', 'mainstream', 'press', 'criticizing', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'was', 'turned', 'off', 'ugly', 'poster', 'art', 'poor', 'marketing', 'thinking', 'was', 'cheesy', 'knock-off', 'Watchmen.Boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'Having', 'just', 'watched', 'can', 'definitely', 'say', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', '2010', 'entertaining', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'movie', 'lots', 'guns', 'tons', 'violence', 'anti-hero', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'Dave', 'being', 'superhero', 'just', 'ordinary', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'dumb', 'green', 'costume', 'made', 'wetsuit', 'bought', 'online', 'only', 'thing', 'going', 'extraordinary', 'ability', 'get', 'ass', 'beaten', 'regular', 'basis', 'gross', 'lack', 'fighting', 'skills', 'third', 'way', 'film', 'saved', 'certain', 'death', 'two', 'real', 'superheroes', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'story', 'converge', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'who', 'Batman/Night', 'Owl', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'are', 'father', 'daughter', 'two', 'highly-skilled', 'vigilantes', 'out', 'settle', 'personal', 'score', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Frank', ""D'Amico"", 'Nick', 'Cage', 'who', ""'m"", 'not', 'normally', 'fond', 'liked', 'film', 'Big', 'Daddy', '13', 'year', 'old', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'adorable', 'deadly', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'as', 'annoying', 'ever.Visually', 'Kick-Ass', 'superb', 'stylish', 'super-violent', 'same', 'way', 'Watchmen', 'was', 'violent', 'stylish', 'not', 'nearly', 'violent', 'Assasin', 'Lots', 'people', 'die', 'fancy', 'inventively-choreographed', 'cleverly', 'shot', 'ways', 'ridiculously', 'over-the-top', 'John', 'Woo-styled', 'clip', 'reloading/gun', 'catching', 'sequence', 'mini-gun/jet-pack', 'end', 'good', 'fun', 'Gun', 'geeks', 'will', 'also', 'drool', 'hardware', 'hanging', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'safe', 'room', 'SMAW', 'shoulder-launched', 'rocket', 'Lots', 'blood', 'Lots', 'stabbings', 'One', 'guy', 'even', 'blown', 'up', 'microwave', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'violence', 'stay', 'far', 'away', 'movie.Story-wise', 'Kick-Ass', 'shares', 'many', 'similarities', 'Nolan', 'Batman', 'films', 'Watchmen', 'Spider-man', 'andL', 'eacute', 'Professionalin', 'heroes', 'are', 'human', 'fallible', 'film', 'place', 'Brooklyn', 'other', 'parts', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'quite', 'obvious', 'locations', 'was', 'shot', 'elsewhere', 'Toronto', 'Canada', 'budgetary', 'reasons.If', 'enjoyed', 'films', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'review', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'Kick-Ass', 'too']",N/A

1305733,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B002ZG983M,Caleb Williams,"[0, 0]","The concept of an average, every day comic book geek donning spandex attire and becoming a super-hero is one that I find quite interesting. I'm sure there are a few crazy people in the world who have contemplated or even attempted just that, but in the comic world, the only character I've been familiar with becoming a super-hero with no particular superpower is Batman. When this was first released and up to the point of me seeing it, I wasn't familiar that this was also made into a comic book, but I was intrigued by the concept and motive behind why the kid in this film wanted to take the leap of faith in becoming a superhero. I gave it a go, and I must say I loved it. Don't expect a full blown comedy, as it's more of a serious action flick, but an enjoyable one nonetheless.Starring Aaron Johnson in the title role of Dave Lizewski, the film tells of how Dave has always wondered why nobody has tried being a superhero (except that one guy at the start of the film who ends up dead). Dave decides to stop wondering and buys himself a green and yellow spandex suit and calls himself Kick-Ass. Life as a super-hero doesn't start very well as he's almost killed in his first attempt at heroics, but he's soon back in action and becomes a viral hit as he's filmed saving a lonely stranger from being beaten up. This gets him some unwanted attention from Mob boss, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) and his son Chris/Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Passe) as he's mistaken as being the man behind a number of mob deaths which were actually committed by the mysterious Father/Daughter team of Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage [sigh]).The films tone is something that is a lot more serious and brutal than you can possibly guess when first going into it as it starts off quite goofy and funny, but when he puts on his hero suit, the film takes a more serious turn. There are some bad points to the film, but thankfully they are outweighed by a plethora of good points; most importantly the character of Hit-Girl. There are two ways you can look at this character; you can be very disturbed by the fact that an 11 year old girl can call someone a f***er then proceed with blowing an enemies head off, or you can watch that exact scene and think ""that is ""f***ing awesome!"" I chose to go with the latter as she was truly magnificent. Nick Cage, on the other hand, was far from magnificent.I know Cage has a devoted following of fans, but I think he's just awful. I can't take the man seriously in any role he plays, and in my eyes every moment he was on screen was just the pits (unless he was supported by other cast members). I could have easily given this film a 5 star rating had Cage's character been played by someone a lot more fitting for the role. I would've preferred someone along the lines of Michael Keaton or Kevin Costner, an old school actor that you can still appreciate today and not want to place your palm on your forehead in disappointment the moment they appear on screen.The look of the film and style of the film overall is brilliantly done. The fact that the film was released shortly before the comic and it was a project that came together collaboratively with Mark Miller working on the comic and Matthew Vaughn working on the movie, when I check the comic out, there will definitely be cool similarities. I would highly recommend this, not for Nick Cage, but for everything else.",4,Kick-Ass - I've always wanted to dress up in tight clothing and be beaten up.,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,3420,"['concept', 'average', 'day', 'comic', 'book', 'geek', 'donning', 'spandex', 'attire', 'becoming', 'super-hero', 'one', 'find', 'quite', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'few', 'crazy', 'people', 'world', 'who', 'have', 'contemplated', 'even', 'attempted', 'just', 'comic', 'world', 'only', 'character', ""'ve"", 'been', 'familiar', 'becoming', 'super-hero', 'particular', 'superpower', 'Batman', 'When', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'up', 'point', 'seeing', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'was', 'also', 'made', 'comic', 'book', 'was', 'intrigued', 'concept', 'motive', 'why', 'kid', 'film', 'wanted', 'take', 'leap', 'faith', 'becoming', 'superhero', 'gave', 'go', 'must', 'say', 'loved', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'full', 'blown', 'comedy', 'more', 'serious', 'action', 'flick', 'enjoyable', 'one', 'nonetheless.Starring', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'title', 'role', 'Dave', 'Lizewski', 'film', 'tells', 'how', 'Dave', 'always', 'wondered', 'why', 'nobody', 'tried', 'being', 'superhero', 'one', 'guy', 'start', 'film', 'who', 'up', 'dead', 'Dave', 'stop', 'wondering', 'green', 'yellow', 'spandex', 'suit', 'Kick-Ass', 'Life', 'super-hero', ""n't"", 'start', 'very', 'well', 'almost', 'killed', 'first', 'attempt', 'heroics', 'soon', 'back', 'action', 'viral', 'hit', 'filmed', 'saving', 'lonely', 'stranger', 'being', 'beaten', 'up', 'unwanted', 'attention', 'Mob', 'boss', 'Frank', ""D'Amico"", 'Mark', 'Strong', 'son', 'Chris/Red', 'Mist', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Passe', 'being', 'man', 'number', 'mob', 'deaths', 'were', 'actually', 'committed', 'mysterious', 'Father/Daughter', 'team', 'Hit-Girl', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', '[', 'sigh', ']', 'films', 'tone', 'something', 'lot', 'more', 'serious', 'brutal', 'can', 'possibly', 'guess', 'when', 'first', 'going', 'quite', 'goofy', 'funny', 'when', 'hero', 'suit', 'film', 'more', 'serious', 'turn', 'are', 'bad', 'points', 'film', 'thankfully', 'are', 'outweighed', 'plethora', 'good', 'points', 'most', 'importantly', 'character', 'Hit-Girl', 'are', 'two', 'ways', 'can', 'look', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'disturbed', 'fact', '11', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'can', 'call', 'someone', 'f***er', 'then', 'proceed', 'blowing', 'enemies', 'head', 'off', 'can', 'watch', 'exact', 'scene', 'think', 'f***ing', 'awesome', 'chose', 'go', 'latter', 'was', 'truly', 'magnificent', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'far', 'magnificent.I', 'know', 'Cage', 'devoted', 'following', 'fans', 'think', 'just', 'awful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'man', 'seriously', 'role', 'eyes', 'moment', 'was', 'screen', 'was', 'just', 'pits', 'was', 'supported', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'given', 'film', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'had', 'Cage', 'character', 'been', 'played', 'someone', 'lot', 'more', 'fitting', 'role', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'someone', 'lines', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'old', 'school', 'actor', 'can', 'still', 'appreciate', 'today', 'not', 'want', 'place', 'palm', 'forehead', 'disappointment', 'moment', 'appear', 'screen.The', 'look', 'film', 'style', 'film', 'overall', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'shortly', 'comic', 'was', 'project', 'came', 'together', 'collaboratively', 'Mark', 'Miller', 'working', 'comic', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'working', 'movie', 'when', 'check', 'comic', 'out', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'cool', 'similarities', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'not', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'everything', 'else']",N/A

Luster ""The Rook""","[0, 0]","When I saw the trailers when this movie was at the theaters I thought this might be an entertaining young adult movie and so I added it to my to rent list. Had I known how entertaining I would have made a now rare visit to my local theater to enjoy this with an audience when it first released. Most kids and even some adults still have the dream of making a difference whether doning a costume or just helping their community in some way. The story here is compelling and like the music starts at a slow tempo as we are introduced first to ""Kick-Ass"", well portrayed by Aaron Johnson. He is a high school student that finally gets tired of bullies and decides to take steps to not only improve his own self-esteem but assist others that are afraid to take a stand. On his first mission to save a lost cat he drops literally into three men beating up another. His fight to defend the single man from the gang is painful for him and lands him it the hospital with broken bones but it is posted on all the usual hot amateur video sites and he becomes famous overnight.This stardom catches the attention of ""Hit Girl"", remarkably done by Chloe Moretz (some superbly choreagraphed scenes make her larger than life), and ""Big Daddy"", well played by Nicolas Cage (purposely overacted while in hero mode is good acting not bad), that have been more reclusive and deadlier against criminals. When they save Kick-Ass from certain death a bond is formed against crime. The choreography and stunts of the fight scenes are phenomenal and the music is fantastic (the CD will be a huge hit I'm sure). As the story unfolds we find out that Big Daddy not only was falsely accused of drug trafficing while he was a police officer but he ends up in jail and his wife commits suicide. Fortunately their daughter is born with her death. When Big Daddy gets out of prison he vows to avenge his wife, and he enlists the aid of his very young daughter on his quest. Enter the villains son, Red Mist, that convinces his father to get him some gear to impress Kick-Ass so that he can lure him into a trap. The events that transpire after this build to an incredible climax that is suspenseful and exhilarating.I won't spoil things for you with any more of the details but there are some absolutely hysterical/bloody scenes that will quite possibly have you laughing and crying with joy. Anyone that feels overly offended by vigilantes may be disturbed. Although I'm not saying I condone it, how can I possibly condone what criminals do to the innocent public? Keep in mind everyone has been exposed to far worse on the news every day. I highly recommend this to anyone that can appreciate unconventional heroes and can stomach some bloody killing scenes. The DVD has excellent quality picture and sound with a few extras. Superb story, casting, directing, choreography, stunts, camera work, costumes, music, and special effects.

While his thought process is not something I pretend to understand, the situations he finds himself in as a typical high schooler were somewhat relatable, and they got a chuckle or two out of me. But then we meet eleven-year-old Mindy Macready (Chlo Grace Moretz) and her father (Nicholas Cage); they stand in an empty lot, her wearing a bulletproof vest, him pointing a gun at her, all in an effort to train her as a crime fighter. He fires his gun, and that's when the movie stopped being funny for me. But it isn't until she kills someone that I finally realized how deplorable it was.A killjoy, am I? You'll forgive if I'm not entertained by the sight of a kid murdering people, or of a kid being beaten within an inch of her life by big, mean men with guns. And I'm even less thrilled with the idea of a father training his child to be a ruthless vigilante, as if he were doing no more than showing her how to ride a bike. Yes, I know it's all done stylistically, that it doesn't represent reality, that the whole thing is supposed to be a satire on society and violence and today's internet culture, and yadda yadda yadda. But there does come a point when enough is enough. If I'm failing to see the genius in ""Kick-Ass,"" that's fine by me, because I truly don't want to understand or even inhabit a world where underage carnage qualifies as something to be laughed at.But before I go too far with this, let me take a moment to discuss the film's first ten minutes, at which point I still had hope it would work. We meet teenager Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), an unremarkable comic book reader who notes that, while just about everyone tries to be like their favorite celebrity, few try to be like a superhero. Of course, no one could ever be Superman, for he possesses extraterrestrial powers that exist only in the imagination - the ability to fly, superhuman strength, x-ray vision, etc. But what about someone like Batman, who has no superpowers? True, he's ultra rich and has access to high tech equipment, but he's still fallible. When Dave is mugged and a bystander fails to intervene, he decides to stop wondering and start acting; he dons a mail order green scuba suit and mask and adopts the alter ego Kick-Ass, New York's newest crime fighter.His attempts at preventing any kind of crime are disastrous, although he quickly becomes a sensation thanks to websites like YouTube and Myspace. This, I can buy: In Western society, anyone can have a taste of fame, even if that person happens to be incredibly untalented. But that's where the satire stops. In due time, Dave crosses paths with Mindy and her father, who dress in flashy superhero suits have adopted the monikers Hit Girl and Big Daddy; both are so skilled at what they do that they seem like ... I was going to say genuine superheroes, but that isn't quite true since all the good ones have never resorted to shooting, stabbing, or throat slitting. However, their knowledge of martial arts is second to none, and so is their ability to jump across long distances and off tall buildings. In other words, they don't seem like ordinary people trying to be superheroes, so the film's premise is now null and void.There's also a subplot involving Big Daddy's target: Crime boss Frank D'Amico (Erik Strong), whose son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), somehow ends up as a patsy named Red Mist, created with the sole intent of luring in Kick-Ass and taking him down. All this could have been halfway entertaining if only it weren't so intertwined with the story of Hit Girl, who at one point finds herself running down a hallway in slow motion, singlehandedly blowing away an entire squad of well-armed hitmen in a blaze of bullets and blood. Had this not involved an eleven-year-old, I might have gotten into the scene's choreography, which, I must admit, is quite impressive. Alas, I'm watching a girl who hasn't even entered puberty relentlessly killing people, something I wouldn't even want to try to enjoy.If this truly is an accurate commentary on today's media-obsessed youth culture, and if we're still at a point when mass audiences find this kind of stuff entertaining, then I'm sorry to say we still have a long, long way to go. Under no circumstances should we be laughing at extreme comic book violence involving children, not at a time when we're saturated with news stories about youth gangs and classroom shootings. ""Kick-Ass"" is a grave miscalculation, not only because of its content, but also because of the belief that it's a harmless, escapist action film. The more I think about the audiences that laughed from beginning to end, the sadder I get.

In the world of ""Kick-Ass,"" of course.I don't shy away from violent movies at all, at least as long as the violence carries some sense of satire, irony, justice or is just flat-out entertaining.But even in the glossiest, most colorful fiction, I just can't get behind the idea of a child, led by a parent, to kill dozens of others in the blood-thirstiest ways available. Especially when those actions are presented as heroic, noble and occasionally bunny-cute. To add insult to countless injuries, the filmmakers' calculated desire to seem audacious and spark controversy is completely transparent.That isn't the least of the film's problems, but it's a large one among many. The film also has a dull lead character, seriously sloppy cinematography and too many confused ideas about what it's trying to say. Half the time it wants to subvert the superhero mythology, the rest of the time it exemplifies the genre at its worst.There's also an eager, trying-way-too-hard masochism to the brutality that reminded me of another recent bad movie, ""Wanted.""

1305752,A2NJ0FN87IN3CL,B002ZG983M,CRAB,"[2, 2]","A lot has been said about this movie, so my goal here is to say just my little piece on this movie because I feel strong enough about it to do so. First of all this movie came straight out of left field, was not expecting the violence & ""Hit Girl"" character. I was not very interested in the title, found it uninteresting, never heard about it(bombed at the box office) & thought it was a kids movie. But like many, when it comes to superheroes, of any kind, there is some kind of draw & attraction so I went ahead & rented the DVD. O.K I won't be philosophical or anything but this is the truth, after watching the movie I was not the same, better or worse, mainly because of hit girl!. I was not sure how I fellt about her character. I finally decided that I was was in awe of Hit Girl. This type of character with the child standing up to the adults had been done before, but not like this! Obviously for those who don't see any positives being portrayed never saw that Cages character as a little insane. Yes he is insane with hate for the murder of his wife and his daughter's stolen youth because of it. He loves his daughter obviously & she loves him. But it's his insanity that allows HIt Girl to exist. His cop friend also is the voice of reason in the movie. But, just like us, he smiled when Hit Girl kicked the bad guys ass at the ""Kick Ass/Big Daddy Execution"".Come on people, this is entertainment! How many movies can you say made such a controversy & like me made me feel changed for better or worse for just watching it. This Hit Girl character took guts to portray. Child characters that taunt & even kill adults is not new. Remember ""The Children"", ""The Omen"", ""The Exorcist"",& ""The Bad Seed"" just to name a few. At least Hit Girl was exterminating bad guys. Anyway, we all have choice. If you don't want your family to see this movie, check the rating before watching & turn it off if you get a surprise because you did not check the rating & investigate the movie before watching it, like me (I watched everything though about 4 times).

I could not wait for the blu-ray to hit my house. We have watched it twice since it got here, today. All the people who gave it 1 star just complain about the violence and cursing. I have a suggestion for them. DO NOT WATCH RATED R MOVIES. Oh, and you shouldn't watch any show on HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, and Starz. You see these channel have a ton of shows that have cursing, violence and sex (the trifecta of badness, LOL).Anyway, this movie is about a kid that wants to be a hero because he is tired of just watching bad things happen around him. After trying it for a while he runs into some real heroes and decides it is too much for him. He is pulled back into it because the bad guy wants to make an example of him to the world. The story ends in triumph and with a warm and fuzzy feeling for all. This movie may not be anexact replica of the comic book, just as Watchmen wasn't an exact replica of its comic book.

1305754,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B002ZG983M,Craig Whittle,"[5, 7]","KICK-ASSSTARRING: Aaron Johnson, Chloe Moretz, Nicolas Cage, Mark Stong, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Lyndsy Fonseca, Clark Duke, Evan Peters and Garrett M. BrownWRITTEN BY: Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn; based on the comic book by Mark Miller and John Romita Jr.DIRECTED BY: Matthew VaughnRated: RGenre: Action / ComedyRelease Date: 17 April 2010Review Date: 22 April 2010I think it's fair to say that most of us have seen a movie or two that displayed all of its greatest achievements in the trailer. This holds particularly true to films of the comedic genre. Kick-Ass however, had the exact opposite effect. Based on its trailer, I was more than skeptical. I was wondering what Nicolas Cage was doing in a film like this. Man, was I surprised.The first 15 minutes or so had me let down and I was sure the film was gonna be a total drag. But then, out of nowhere, I was completely taken aback by a sharp turn in the tone of the film, and was rolling with laughter from there all the way to its hilarious climax. The fact that the trailer also led me to believe that it was only rated PG - 13, was another genuine treat. It's very much rated R.Aaron Johnson stars as your everyday American high school kid, David. David fantasizes about his teacher, the hot girl in school, and of course what it would be like to have super powers. The latter causes him to ask himself why no-one has ever tried being a superhero without any powers. He shall like to be the first. He orders a costume off the internet and goes to work to fight crime.He looks absolutely ridiculous in his hideous pine green and yellow ninja looking outfit, but that's what makes the film fun. It's called Kick-Ass folks, so if you are taking the time to watch the film, you can't exactly expect it to be Oscar-worthy now can you? Oh yeah, and it's called Kick-Ass, because that's the superhero name he deems himself with.When David finds himself ready to due battle against two local punks, while dressed in his costume of course, we are rooting for him. We expect he will actually take be able to take them down. We expect pretty much anything other than what actually happens, to happen! This would be the 90 degree turn the film takes that I was referring to earlier. We go from a comedy, to a very dark comedy laced with buckets and buckets of blood brought forth from hilarious scenes of violence.There are additional characters in the film, who I found even more appealing than David. Nicolas Cage plays a single father raising his 11-year-old daughter. We meet them in one of the most creative and humorous scenes that I have ever seen and I won't spoil it for you. It's safe to say that only Nicolas Cage could have pulled the scene off as good as he does, and still have us liking the character.Cage and his daughter (Chloe Moretz) play Big Daddy and Hit Girl. They two are masked avengers of justice, and are far better at it than David. Their costumes are so B-rate, that they are in fact genius, and will no doubt be among the most popular come this Halloween.Bid Daddy has trained Hit Girl to be the ultimate crime fighting machine. In addition to that, he's also taught her a long list of choice four-lettered words, to which she delivers with a classic juvenile charm.What so many people have found absurd and offensive about this, is what I appreciated most about the film. The violence that is depicted here isn't exactly what you would call your everyday comic-book movie violence. Hit Girl and Big Daddy brutally murder every bad guy they come across. It may sound strange and twisted, but seeing it in this film, it is hysterical. Cage and Moretz are both sensational actors and are perfect for these roles. They steal the show in every scene and a star has been born in Chloe Moretz.When a ruthless mob boss (Mark Strong) has had enough of the mysterious crime fighters spoiling his plans, he puts forth a counterstrike to trap them, using Kick-Ass. That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell.There are a few things wrong with the film, and even though it's ridiculous, I know they could have written it better. Some jokes were missed and or executed poorly and at times the dialogue wasn't what it could have been either. Nonetheless there are so many genuine laughs, that we are still able to enjoy the film.If you have been told you don't have an open mind, then skip this film. It has been ridiculed by far too many uptight cry-babies and it needs to stop. Don't sabotage a good thing. The film is absurd but it wants to be, and its fans prefer it to be. So leave it alone, or I'll (insert this film title with the word your implanted in the middle of it, and then smile.:)",4,Kick-Ass Review,1274400000,"05 21, 2010",2010,4664,"['KICK-ASSSTARRING', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Mark', 'Stong', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'Lyndsy', 'Fonseca', 'Clark', 'Duke', 'Evan', 'Peters', 'Garrett', 'M.', 'BrownWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Jane', 'Goldman', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'Mark', 'Miller', 'John', 'Romita', 'Jr.DIRECTED', 'BY', 'Matthew', 'VaughnRated', 'RGenre', 'Action', '/', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '17', 'April', '2010Review', 'Date', '22', 'April', '2010I', 'think', 'fair', 'say', 'most', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'two', 'displayed', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'trailer', 'particularly', 'true', 'films', 'comedic', 'genre', 'Kick-Ass', 'however', 'had', 'exact', 'opposite', 'effect', 'Based', 'trailer', 'was', 'more', 'skeptical', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'was', 'doing', 'film', 'Man', 'was', 'surprised.The', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'so', 'had', 'let', 'was', 'sure', 'film', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'total', 'drag', 'then', 'nowhere', 'was', 'completely', 'taken', 'aback', 'sharp', 'turn', 'tone', 'film', 'was', 'rolling', 'laughter', 'way', 'hilarious', 'climax', 'fact', 'trailer', 'also', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'only', 'rated', 'PG', '13', 'was', 'genuine', 'treat', 'very', 'much', 'rated', 'R.Aaron', 'Johnson', 'everyday', 'American', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'David', 'David', 'teacher', 'hot', 'girl', 'school', 'course', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'super', 'powers', 'latter', 'ask', 'why', 'no-one', 'ever', 'tried', 'being', 'superhero', 'powers', 'shall', 'like', 'be', 'first', 'orders', 'costume', 'internet', 'work', 'fight', 'crime.He', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'hideous', 'pine', 'green', 'yellow', 'ninja', 'looking', 'outfit', 'what', 'film', 'fun', 'called', 'Kick-Ass', 'folks', 'so', 'are', 'taking', 'time', 'watch', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'expect', 'be', 'Oscar-worthy', 'now', 'can', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'called', 'Kick-Ass', 'superhero', 'name', 'with.When', 'David', 'ready', 'due', 'battle', 'two', 'local', 'punks', 'dressed', 'costume', 'course', 'are', 'rooting', 'expect', 'will', 'actually', 'take', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'down', 'expect', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'other', 'what', 'actually', 'happen', 'would', 'be', '90', 'degree', 'turn', 'film', 'was', 'referring', 'earlier', 'go', 'comedy', 'very', 'dark', 'comedy', 'laced', 'buckets', 'buckets', 'blood', 'brought', 'forth', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'are', 'additional', 'characters', 'film', 'who', 'found', 'even', 'more', 'appealing', 'David', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'single', 'father', 'raising', '11-year-old', 'daughter', 'meet', 'one', 'most', 'creative', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'safe', 'say', 'only', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'scene', 'off', 'as', 'good', 'still', 'have', 'liking', 'character.Cage', 'daughter', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'play', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'two', 'are', 'masked', 'avengers', 'justice', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'David', 'costumes', 'are', 'so', 'B-rate', 'are', 'fact', 'genius', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'most', 'popular', 'come', 'Halloween.Bid', 'Daddy', 'trained', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'be', 'ultimate', 'crime', 'fighting', 'machine', 'addition', 'also', 'taught', 'long', 'list', 'choice', 'four-lettered', 'words', 'classic', 'juvenile', 'charm.What', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'found', 'absurd', 'offensive', 'what', 'appreciated', 'most', 'film', 'violence', 'depicted', 'here', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'everyday', 'comic-book', 'movie', 'violence', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'brutally', 'bad', 'guy', 'come', 'may', 'sound', 'strange', 'twisted', 'seeing', 'film', 'hysterical', 'Cage', 'Moretz', 'are', 'sensational', 'actors', 'are', 'perfect', 'roles', 'steal', 'show', 'scene', 'star', 'been', 'born', 'Chloe', 'Moretz.When', 'ruthless', 'mob', 'boss', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'had', 'mysterious', 'crime', 'fighters', 'spoiling', 'plans', 'forth', 'counterstrike', 'trap', 'using', 'Kick-Ass', 'pretty', 'much', 'plot', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'wrong', 'film', 'even', 'ridiculous', 'know', 'could', 'have', 'written', 'better', 'jokes', 'were', 'missed', 'executed', 'poorly', 'times', 'dialogue', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'genuine', 'laughs', 'are', 'still', 'able', 'enjoy', 'film.If', 'have', 'been', 'told', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'then', 'skip', 'film', 'been', 'ridiculed', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'uptight', 'cry-babies', 'stop', 'Do', ""n't"", 'sabotage', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'absurd', 'be', 'fans', 'prefer', 'be', 'So', 'leave', 'alone', ""'ll"", 'insert', 'film', 'title', 'word', 'implanted', 'middle', 'then', 'smile']",N/A

Most noticeably, there's crime kingpin Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), whose son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) just wants in on the family business, even if it means making a friend and subsequently betraying him.  All of these culminates in a bloody, brilliant show-down.At the heart of KICK-ASS (and there is a heart) is the notion that only social misfits and people unsatisfied with their lot in life would ever don a costume.  No one in this film is perfect; Dave is lost and looking for himself, and both Big Daddy and Hit Girl are sociopaths; they make D'Amico (who microwaves a guy alive) look tame.  But that's the genius of KICK-ASS: it never takes itself seriously, so you never get the idea that it's promoting (or condemning, for that matter) violence.  The film (and graphic novel) just IS: it's here for your entertainment, and make of it what you will.Matthew Vaughn's directing is solid, as is the script; but the film hinges entirely upon the performances, as most films of this kind do.  Graphic violence and dark humor will only get you so far--as evidenced by the fact that the film falls away in the middle, as the violence slowly overtakes the humor.  Thankfully, we have solid performances, mainly from the supporting cast; Johnson is fine, but he couldn't have carried this film alone.  We have Mark Strong as the villain, menacing and hilarious at the same time; Strong has a knack for sinking his teeth into this sort of role.  As D'Amico's son, Mintz-Plasse manages to break out of typecast; he's entirely believable in his role as (first) and ignored son, and then as the masked ""hero"" Red Mist.  But it's really the teaming of Cage and Moretz that will be remembered.  Cage is delightfully over-the-top, going from aw-shucks to Dark Knight and back again.  Moretz is a wonder; easily the most controversial part of the film (and that's saying a lot, considering the level of violence here), she spouts obscenities and slits throats with a grace that's rarely seen in these films (also in time with the requisite rock 'n roll soundtrack; Vaughn getting his Tarantino on).  It's Hit Girl this film will be most remembered for, but really, the whole cast deserves a round of applause.  Even with the stellar source material, even with a fine script and directing and choreography, this film could easily have tanked.  As is, it stands as a great entry into the superhero cannon, both parodying the genre and trying to explain some of its appeal.  It is dark, laugh-out-loud hilarious, and violent: everything you could want on a Friday night.",4,"""Everything's under control?

1305758,A9NCQGVV5W8N0,B002ZG983M,"darklordzden ""darklordzden""","[6, 9]","New York, The Present: Dave Lizewski is, by his own admission, a non-descript kind of teenager who drifts from one unremarkable day of high-school to the next. He spends his days fixating on his English teacher's breasts, reading comic books, hanging out at the local comic store with his equally feckless friends and wasting far too much time on social networking sites on the internet. It is this life of unremitting banality - as well as his own inherent naivety - that leads him to don a green and yellow diving suit and mask and attempt to live the life of a superhero. However, as Dave is about to find out, trying to dispense comic book justice and cookie-cutter morality on the streets of a mob-town like New York can be a very dangerous idea indeed...Matthew Vaughn's ""Kick Ass"" is a glorious satire of the notions of super-heroism, vigilantism, fanboy culture and Gen Y's obsession with spectacle and hyper-reality; I also suspect that is probably a very faithful adaptation of Mark Millar's comic book (and whilst I haven't read this particular book myself, I am familiar enough with the rest of Millar's work to recognise the pertinent hallmarks of lunatic genius that have made the mad Scotsman a ""force majeure"" in the comic book industry) given that it is violent, foul-mouthed, disturbing and amusing in equal measures (and on a number of different levels) and it is, for the most part, whip-smart. As a screen outing, its also a far more satisfying depiction of Millar's obsessions than the awful ""Wanted"" movie (a film which took an amoral tale told amorally and attempted to sanitise it for the screen).I can't really go into too many details of the plot without ruining this film but all I will say this: if you're sick of the nauseating pontification that gets shoe-horned into most modern American action cinema, then this will be right up your alley because its a glorious fart in the face of conventional cinematic wisdom and morality. Parents should be warned though that despite being tangentially about superheroes, this film is emphatically NOT suitable for children. Don't let the shiny costumes fool you. It is an adult fairy tale with a pronounced accent on the ""adult"".For the record, my partner and I generally despise Superheroes and Superhero movies on the grounds that most of them are nauseatingly smug morality plays which have no basis in reality - that was not the case with this film.

Reading some of the more negative reviews the resevations about this film seem to center on the use of a preteen (Chloe Grace Moretz) in violent and profane situations.  This debate has been going on since ""The Exorcist"" and ""Taxi Driver"" in the Seventies and this argument will go on forever.  Regardless, I love this movie because it gives a jump start to a moribund genre, the comic book movie.  Director Matthew Vaughan has concocted something fresh, funny, original, and action packed.  Aaron Johnson is fine as Dave/Kick-Ass but everyone knows this is Moretz's vehicle.  Whenever she's on screen the energy level of the film rises appreciably.  Moretz's work here suggests a young Jodie Foster in the aforementioned ""Taxi Driver"".  Christopher Mintz-Plasse's star continues to rise after his memorable turn as McLovin in ""Superbad"".  If memory serves the film did OK but not great box office.

In my opinion, most comic book based movies suck, so I had very low expectations for ""Kick Ass"". I thought my fears were justified until Big Daddy and Hit Girl appear on the screen. What makes this movie memorable, and the reason why ""Kick Ass"" will remain a cult classic for years to come, is those two characters.Big Daddy is a mentally disturbed man, set on revenge, whose idea of showing love for his daughter is to fire low velocity bullets at her while she wears a bulletproof vest instead of high velocity rounds. He molds Hit Girl into a remorseless killing machine who can also swear like a sailor in a Manila brothel. Despite the patent immorality of Big Daddy's education of his daughter, his love for her, and her devotion for him, are never in doubt. Nicolas Cage and Chloe Moretz make the loving relationship between the two believable despite the obvious disfunctionality of the family.Although the movie is called ""Kick Ass"" after the titular hero, Hit Girl is the real superhero of the movie. She steals the picture from the first scene she is in. Despite her cussing and murderous ways, Hit Girl is still just a little girl at heart, who just wants to please her daddy. She is not immoral, because she has been raised with a different set of moral values. The violence she perpetrates is over the top, and at times is creative. You will see ways of killing criminals you have never seen before. Hit-Girl has been vilified by crusading movie critics, but she will go down as one of the greatest anti-hero movie characters ever. She belongs with ""The-Man-With-No-Name"" played by Clint Eastwood, and ""The Terminator"" played by Arnold Schwarzenegger as a ruthless and amoral character that you actually cheer for.I can't believe I'm going to say this... but I'm actually looking forward for the sequel.",5,"Should have been called ""Hit Girl Kicks Ass""",1289347200,"11 10, 2010",2010,2025,"['movie', 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'who', 'want', 'impress', 'people', 'deep', 'moral', 'values', 'look', 'down', 'realize', 'just', 'MOVIE', 'intended', 'entertainment', 'opinion', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'based', 'movies', 'suck', 'had', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'thought', 'fears', 'were', 'justified', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'appear', 'screen', 'What', 'movie', 'memorable', 'reason', 'why', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'will', 'remain', 'cult', 'classic', 'years', 'come', 'two', 'characters.Big', 'Daddy', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'man', 'set', 'revenge', 'idea', 'showing', 'love', 'daughter', 'fire', 'low', 'velocity', 'bullets', 'bulletproof', 'vest', 'instead', 'high', 'velocity', 'rounds', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'remorseless', 'killing', 'machine', 'who', 'can', 'also', 'swear', 'sailor', 'Manila', 'brothel', 'patent', 'immorality', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'education', 'daughter', 'love', 'devotion', 'are', 'never', 'doubt', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'make', 'loving', 'relationship', 'two', 'believable', 'obvious', 'disfunctionality', 'family.Although', 'movie', 'called', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'titular', 'hero', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'real', 'superhero', 'movie', 'picture', 'first', 'scene', 'cussing', 'murderous', 'ways', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'still', 'just', 'little', 'girl', 'heart', 'who', 'just', 'please', 'daddy', 'not', 'immoral', 'been', 'raised', 'different', 'set', 'moral', 'values', 'violence', 'top', 'times', 'creative', 'will', 'see', 'ways', 'killing', 'criminals', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'Hit-Girl', 'been', 'vilified', 'crusading', 'movie', 'critics', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'greatest', 'anti-hero', 'movie', 'characters', 'ever', 'The-Man-With-No-Name', 'played', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Terminator', 'played', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'ruthless', 'amoral', 'character', 'actually', 'cheer', 'for.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'going', 'say', ""'m"", 'actually', 'looking', 'forward', 'sequel']",N/A

1305776,A106YXO3EHVD3J,B002ZG983M,"DR SHOCK ""MR. KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[1, 1]","I had wanted to see Kick-Ass ever since I saw the trailer a few years ago. What looked to be just another ""by the numbers"" comedy turned out to be a brilliant and wickedly funny satire for adults.This film isn't going to appeal to everyone and I'm not here to insult anyone on either side of the fence. I enjoyed the film and I see nothing wrong with it. If you don't like it that's fine too and if you don't think your kids should see it, then don't let them, it wasn't intended for children, but I do believe that trailer marketed it to look like a much more innocent film. The R rating should be enough warning for parents to get the idea that this film isn't for children.As far as the violence involving the young actress who plays Hit Girl, I can remember many Little Rascal shorts that involved the rascals dragging adults across boards with nails in them or hitting them in the head with hammers etc, so this is not all that new to the world. I realize that this film shows violence that is way more graphic and serious, but I also think we have become a little over sensitive and read way too much into everything these days.There were similar reactions to 'The Exorcist' and 'Pretty Baby' in their day and since Linda Blair and Brooke Shields seemed to have turned out OK I see no reason for such commotion. Everything is open to individual interpretation and depending on your age you may not realize that this has been going on since the early stages of filmmaking. I remember eight Shirley Temple vehicles called 'Baby Burlesks' she made before her wonderful feature films that portrayed 3 year olds as adults which I find much more alarming that this film.Now.....let's get to the movie. The casting is perfect with each of the four heroes having their own quirks and enough back story to propel this kind of film. Aaron Johnson plays the title character a Peter Parker type of nerdy school kid who without the aid of super powers decides he wants to fight crime. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays ""Red Mist"" another school nerd who's father happens to be a gangster boss. Nick Cage gives one of his best performances as ""Big Daddy"" an ex cop who was framed and jailed for 5 years and wants nothing more than to crush those responsible. He enlists the aid of his pint sized potty mouthed daughter Mindy A.K.A. ""Hit Girl"" played by Chloe Moretz who absolutely owns this film! Moretz shows incredible chops here not only as an actress, but as a stunt person, she performs almost all her own stunts and her performance is amazing. I know some see this kid's character as child exploitation, but really each child is different and some are more mature that others and it is her parents responsibility not mine to see to it she can handle such a role.While the film is extremely violent, it is portrayed much like in many comic books today which is a lot more disturbing than this film. I know that a lot of adults read comics, but comics are made for kids or at least that was their original intent, if comic books are going to have graphic violence, maybe there should be age restrictions on those too? I haven't seen an actual 'Kick Ass' comic book so I can't respond on how closely this movie portrays the comic, but I can tell you, this is easily one of the best comic book movies ever made.The Blu Ray combo pack has a slick looking transfer and plenty of behind the scenes features for fans. I hope that this Blu Ray DVD combo trend continues as I really like having both Blu Ray and DVD as I haven't fully committed to Blu Ray and it's nice to have both formats in case I want to watch this film as someone's home who doesn't have a Blu Ray.In Short Kick-Ass does just that all around!",5,"VIOLENT, DISTURBING AND FUN!

1305777,A6LUXI8I8BU6P,B002ZG983M,"D Strick ""Entertainment D""","[4, 5]","Kick Ass concerns young Dave Lizewski (played wonderfully by Aaron Johnson) who wonders - why aren't there any super heroes?  Despite his friends' advice that anyone who tried would be killed in a day he tries and is promptly almost killed.  Several steel plates and a higher tolerance for pain (due to damaged nerves) later and he's at it again.This is a wonderful movie full of wit and charm but also full of violence and is not for the squeamish.  Buying himself a super hero-ish suit from eBay Dave eventually make a splash fighting off some thugs and getting posted on YouTube.  Before long he's unintentionally running afoul of organized crime and other superheroes alike.  Additionally he's having trouble wooing the girl he likes since she mistakenly thinks he's gay due to a rumor that started after his accident.Those other superheroes come in the form of Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz).  Big Daddy is a wronged man with a grudge and Hit Girl is his 11 or 12 year old daughter he's trained in weapons, martial arts and the art of killing.  This most likely is why a big studio would not pick this project up (their loss) and what may put some people off.  But let me tell you ALL the best action scene in this move involve Hit Girl kicking butt and taking names.  She easily and literally slices through gang members and gangsters with glee.  There's something about her though, a sweetness and an eagerness to please her dad that makes you like her.The local crime boss takes exception to all the super hero-ing going on and his son (Christopher ""McLovin"" Mintz-Plasse) hatches a plan to lure in Kick Ass.  Bad things ensue all leading up to one of the more satisfying finales I've seen in a super hero flick in a while.  And in the end we get a bittersweet yet triumphant ending.Here are some downsides I saw.  It seemed like the injuries received by Kick Ass early on were almost magically healed.  He took pretty horrific injuries and based on the x-ray we are shown of his metal plates he should at least have some wicked scars but that's not the case.  Subsequent beatings yield similar results.  I know it's an action film so some of that should be expected but there it is.  Also the gay subplot seemed to be too easily and quickly wrapped up - one short scene and, bam, it was resolved.  CGI blood is way too obvious.But there is so much good.  This movie has heart and is not just a dumb action movie.  In spots it can make you laugh or cry, it can make you cringe or cheer, it can surprise you and scare you and it can make you think and be wowed.  The various elements of the movie gel together to make a very satisfying whole.  You do care about the characters and all the actors involved do a great job as well.  It's a well rounded movie.  Again though, a warning, this is not for kids.  If you are squeamish and don't like violence or language this is not for you.  It's not as uber violent as it sounds but there are scenes that can make you cringe.  If they'd not gone with the CGI blood in a lot of cases it may have genuinely been gory at times.

Here it works, and that is one of the many things I love about KICK-ASS (a/k/a KICKASS). Though I'm fairly certain I spotted some familiar London street scenes.The sweet-looking newcomer Aaron Johnson [(The Illusionist (Full Screen Edition)as the young ""Eisenheim""] plays David Lizewski, a typical high school kid who longs to be a superhero after it dawns on him that we need superheroes. He orders a unique wetsuit online, and in no time becomes KICK-ASS, New York's answer to Batman. He knows very well, as he admits in his ongoing narrative, that the going won't be so easy. His first time out proves that, but I will not spoil it here. Suffice it to say it is so funny I almost fell to the floor. No kidding.Cutting across the story of KICK-ASS is the story of Batman lookalike ""Big Daddy"" (Nicholas Cage) and his well-trained 11-year old daughter ""Hit-Girl"" (a delightfully brash and foulmouthed Chlo Grace Moretz) - these are the true superheroes with money, equipment and attitudes from hell to back their plays. Kick-Ass becomes famous through the miracle of the internet, and I loved the brief but powerful parody of internet fame. Kick-Ass receives pleas for help thereby, he meets Big Daddy and Hit-Girl. It is then he learns exactly what he has chosen for his vocation, a bit too late, one might say.This film is not for the faint of heart, yet is so hilarious, with its common touch, that it is riveting. I'm not really sure what I thought of a lethally trained pre-adolescent girl equally proficient with firearms and knives. All I can say is I'd be damned proud if I had a daughter like her. (My wife is like her, though.) Nicholas Cage seems gaunt and grouchy, but his character is worth 1,000 words. It is the one critique I have: Cage and Johnson should each have had their own separate films.Perhaps that is in the works, but I doubt Cage or anyone like him will return. You will see for yourself why that is. In the end, everyone learns what the price of ""super"" power really is. As Kick-Ass says, with no power there is no responsibility, but ... we all know the end of that sentence.Running straight into the evil mob boss Frank D'Amico (the incredible Mark Strong doing an excellent NYC accent), the superheroes all end up paying a heavy price indeed. Again, I will not spoil this either.A few observations:1. Aaron Johnson is one of the most handsome stars I've ever seen this side of Ryan Phillippe. As this film strives to demonstrate in very funny ways, he's allegedly not gay ... he certainly seems to be to me. Johnson's engagement to a forty-something-year-old broad (director of Johnson's other ""big"" filmNowhere Boy) when he was 19 is basically THE 'gay red flag' of the decade. So bear in mind as you see this film, Johnson was already engaged to a woman old enough to be his mother - and then some.2. This film could have done well without as much cheesy music (come on, Elvis?!), but it is for the most part a powerful soundtrack. Some song that I think is called ""Town Ain't Big Enough for the Both of Us"" is awesome.3. Director Matthew Vaughn (Stardust) has a real feel for heroes: he outdoes the wretched WATCHMEN though I admit there'd be none of this without that original comic.Why are the British doing all this cool stuff? It took me 1/2 hour to realize everyone in the film is British except for Nicholas Cage and perhaps two others. It took me until the final credits to realize it was all filmed in London. No wonder some of the characters gave me the creeps - you know, the willies you get from an ""American"" who just doesn't sound right.KeepThe Incredibles (Full Screen Two-Disc Collector's Edition)near to hand if you are fainthearted, I'm warning you fair and square. KICK-ASS does not skimp on the reality of the violence, but it is not gratuitous or disgusting like, say, SIN CITY (which is cited in this film). The skilled way it switches between violence and comedy is refreshing. I think it drives home the fact that violence is NOT funny or light-hearted.Get this and stew in the first viewing a while before seeing it again: it will inform you deeply about your hidden feelings regarding vigilantism, violence, pop culture and comic books. They are all related, and I've never seen a film explain that intimate connexion like this does.",4,That was an Armenian with mental problems,1281052800,"08 6, 2010",2010,4455,"['Never', 'born', 'days', 'did', 'suspect', 'London', 'England', 'could', 'double', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Elstree', 'Pinewood', 'studios', 'offering', 'rest', 'necessary', 'sets', 'Here', 'one', 'many', 'things', 'love', 'KICK-ASS', 'a/k/a', 'KICKASS', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'certain', 'spotted', 'familiar', 'London', 'street', 'scenes.The', 'sweet-looking', 'newcomer', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', '[', 'Illusionist', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'young', 'Eisenheim', ']', 'David', 'Lizewski', 'typical', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'who', 'be', 'superhero', 'need', 'superheroes', 'orders', 'unique', 'wetsuit', 'online', 'time', 'KICK-ASS', 'New', 'York', 'answer', 'Batman', 'very', 'well', 'ongoing', 'narrative', 'going', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'easy', 'first', 'time', 'out', 'proves', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'here', 'Suffice', 'say', 'so', 'funny', 'almost', 'fell', 'floor', 'No', 'kidding.Cutting', 'story', 'KICK-ASS', 'story', 'Batman', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'well-trained', '11-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Hit-Girl', 'delightfully', 'brash', 'foulmouthed', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'are', 'true', 'superheroes', 'money', 'equipment', 'attitudes', 'hell', 'back', 'plays', 'Kick-Ass', 'famous', 'miracle', 'internet', 'loved', 'brief', 'powerful', 'parody', 'internet', 'fame', 'Kick-Ass', 'pleas', 'help', 'thereby', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Hit-Girl', 'then', 'exactly', 'what', 'chosen', 'vocation', 'bit', 'too', 'late', 'one', 'might', 'say.This', 'film', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'so', 'hilarious', 'common', 'touch', 'riveting', ""'m"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'thought', 'lethally', 'trained', 'pre-adolescent', 'girl', 'equally', 'proficient', 'firearms', 'knives', 'can', 'say', ""'d"", 'be', 'damned', 'proud', 'had', 'daughter', 'wife', 'though', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'gaunt', 'grouchy', 'character', 'worth', '1,000', 'words', 'one', 'critique', 'have', 'Cage', 'Johnson', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'own', 'separate', 'films.Perhaps', 'works', 'doubt', 'Cage', 'anyone', 'will', 'return', 'will', 'see', 'why', 'end', 'everyone', 'what', 'price', 'super', 'power', 'really', 'Kick-Ass', 'power', 'responsibility', 'know', 'end', 'sentence.Running', 'straight', 'evil', 'mob', 'boss', 'Frank', ""D'Amico"", 'incredible', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'doing', 'excellent', 'NYC', 'accent', 'superheroes', 'end', 'up', 'paying', 'heavy', 'price', 'indeed', 'Again', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'either.A', 'few', 'observations:1', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'one', 'most', 'handsome', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'side', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'film', 'demonstrate', 'very', 'funny', 'ways', 'allegedly', 'not', 'gay', 'certainly', 'be', 'Johnson', 'engagement', 'forty-something-year-old', 'broad', 'director', 'Johnson', 'other', 'big', 'filmNowhere', 'Boy', 'when', 'was', '19', 'basically', 'THE', ""'gay"", 'red', 'flag', 'decade', 'So', 'bear', 'mind', 'see', 'film', 'Johnson', 'was', 'already', 'engaged', 'woman', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'mother', 'then', 'some.2', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'as', 'much', 'cheesy', 'music', 'come', 'Elvis', 'most', 'part', 'powerful', 'soundtrack', 'song', 'think', 'called', 'Town', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Big', 'Enough', 'Both', 'Us', 'awesome.3', 'Director', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'Stardust', 'real', 'feel', 'heroes', 'wretched', 'WATCHMEN', 'admit', ""'d"", 'be', 'none', 'original', 'comic.Why', 'are', 'British', 'doing', 'cool', 'stuff', 'took', '1/2', 'hour', 'realize', 'everyone', 'film', 'British', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'perhaps', 'two', 'others', 'took', 'final', 'credits', 'realize', 'was', 'filmed', 'London', 'No', 'wonder', 'characters', 'gave', 'creeps', 'know', 'willies', 'get', 'American', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'sound', 'right.KeepThe', 'Incredibles', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Two-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'hand', 'are', 'fainthearted', ""'m"", 'warning', 'fair', 'square', 'KICK-ASS', 'not', 'skimp', 'reality', 'violence', 'not', 'gratuitous', 'disgusting', 'say', 'SIN', 'CITY', 'cited', 'film', 'skilled', 'way', 'violence', 'comedy', 'refreshing', 'think', 'home', 'fact', 'violence', 'NOT', 'funny', 'light-hearted.Get', 'stew', 'first', 'viewing', 'while', 'seeing', 'again', 'will', 'inform', 'deeply', 'hidden', 'feelings', 'regarding', 'vigilantism', 'violence', 'pop', 'culture', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'related', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'explain', 'intimate', 'connexion']",N/A

1305787,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B002ZG983M,Enjolras,"[1, 1]","Have you ever wanted to be a superhero.Kick-Assis about four very different people who take very different paths to become superheroes. With a few exceptions, they do provide some innovative fighting scenes and hilarious moments.First, the great. One of the superheroes, Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), is a adorable 10-year old girl who has a passion for guns and slaughtering bad guys the way other young girls get excited for jewelry or dolls. Chloe is a great actress and gives her character a unique spunk and energy. In several scenes, she has the best fighting scenes and is absolutely merciless. She easily steals the show.The fighting scenes are also pretty cool. Make no mistake - this is a violent movie. But unlike a lot of other fighting movies, it doesn't take itself too seriously.Kick-Assis willing to be original in terms of who gets killed and how. I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say that somebody knows how to use a knife very well. At times, you won't know whether to be disgusted by the violence or laughing at the absurdity.Kick-Assalso sets up the contrasts between the mundane and superhero worlds really well. The high school world of teen romance and comic books looks petty in comparison with the blood and gore of the fight scenes. Also, the corny superhero names and goofy costumes contrasted with the deadly seriousness of the characters - what a riot. And, of course Chloe Moretz as a cute little girl who swears like a truck driver and kills like a commando is the ultimate mind-boggling contrast in this movie.I did feel the movie went a bit far in some scenes. Some scenes were just filled with gratuitously bloodshed and outright murder. I still don't get why Hollywood has abandoned the art of panning away right before the victim gets killed (interestingly enough, the only timeKick-Assdoes spare you the sight of blood is when a female gets killed). I think the movie would actually have benefitted from a bit less explicit gore and more innuendo.I also thought the rest of the casting was alright, but not stellar. I've never been a fan of Nicholas Cage, and this movie convinced me that his acting just isn't up to it. The contrast between him and Chloe Moretz - his daughter in the movie - is striking. Aaron Johnson is decent as the dorky Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass, but gets overshadowed halfway through the film - his character reaches his peak too quickly. Mark Strong as the druglord villain just doesn't convince. We're supposed to fear and hate his character, but really he just comes across as a good excuse to kick some ass.Overall, I'd warn sensitive types away from this movie. This is a comedy only in the darkest sense. However, if you like a few laughs, a bit of fighting, and a lot of both mixed together,Kick-Assworks wonders. It's original, fresh, and funny. But for some of the casting and excess in gore, I feel it could even have become an action-hero classic.",4,Gratuitous violence and ridiculous action sequences - but hilarious,1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,2926,"['Have', 'ever', 'wanted', 'be', 'superhero.Kick-Assis', 'four', 'very', 'different', 'people', 'who', 'take', 'very', 'different', 'paths', 'become', 'superheroes', 'few', 'exceptions', 'do', 'provide', 'innovative', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'hilarious', 'moments.First', 'great', 'One', 'superheroes', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'adorable', '10-year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'passion', 'guns', 'slaughtering', 'bad', 'guys', 'way', 'other', 'young', 'girls', 'get', 'excited', 'jewelry', 'dolls', 'Chloe', 'great', 'actress', 'character', 'unique', 'spunk', 'energy', 'several', 'scenes', 'best', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'absolutely', 'merciless', 'easily', 'show.The', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'are', 'also', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Make', 'mistake', 'violent', 'movie', 'lot', 'other', 'fighting', 'movies', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously.Kick-Assis', 'willing', 'be', 'original', 'terms', 'who', 'killed', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'anything', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'somebody', 'how', 'use', 'knife', 'very', 'well', 'times', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'be', 'disgusted', 'violence', 'laughing', 'absurdity.Kick-Assalso', 'sets', 'up', 'contrasts', 'mundane', 'superhero', 'worlds', 'really', 'well', 'high', 'school', 'world', 'teen', 'romance', 'comic', 'books', 'petty', 'comparison', 'blood', 'gore', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Also', 'corny', 'superhero', 'names', 'goofy', 'costumes', 'contrasted', 'deadly', 'seriousness', 'characters', 'what', 'riot', 'course', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'cute', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'truck', 'driver', 'kills', 'commando', 'ultimate', 'mind-boggling', 'contrast', 'movie.I', 'did', 'feel', 'movie', 'went', 'bit', 'far', 'scenes', 'scenes', 'were', 'just', 'filled', 'gratuitously', 'bloodshed', 'outright', 'murder', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'abandoned', 'art', 'panning', 'away', 'right', 'victim', 'killed', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'only', 'timeKick-Assdoes', 'spare', 'sight', 'blood', 'when', 'female', 'killed', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'actually', 'have', 'benefitted', 'bit', 'less', 'explicit', 'gore', 'more', 'innuendo.I', 'also', 'thought', 'rest', 'casting', 'was', 'alright', 'not', 'stellar', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'movie', 'convinced', 'acting', 'just', ""n't"", 'up', 'contrast', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'daughter', 'movie', 'striking', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'decent', 'dorky', 'Dave', 'Lizewski/Kick-Ass', 'overshadowed', 'halfway', 'film', 'character', 'peak', 'too', 'quickly', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'druglord', 'villain', 'just', ""n't"", 'convince', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'fear', 'hate', 'character', 'really', 'just', 'across', 'good', 'excuse', 'kick', 'ass.Overall', ""'d"", 'warn', 'sensitive', 'types', 'away', 'movie', 'comedy', 'only', 'darkest', 'sense', 'However', 'like', 'few', 'laughs', 'bit', 'fighting', 'lot', 'mixed', 'together', 'Kick-Assworks', 'wonders', 'original', 'fresh', 'funny', 'casting', 'excess', 'gore', 'feel', 'could', 'even', 'have', 'become', 'action-hero', 'classic']",N/A

1305797,A1GXBMUTVHWHJL,B002ZG983M,Flash,"[0, 0]","This movie is outright hilarious with tons of laugh out loud moments. It starts out innocently enough when a high school kid decides to dress up and act the role of a superhero. Things don't go quite as you would expect and the outrageousness just ramps up from there until the end of the movie. I felt that I was watching several movies because the mood would switch from quirky teen drama, to crime/mob boss movie, and of course, to superhero adventure.

There is one scene, during which the protagonist is engaged in a battle to defend a man who is being attacked by three others. He is outnumbered, outclassed, and clearly in over his head. He takes a wicked beating, yet he refuses to give up, and he sacrifices his body for the sake of defending a stranger. One of the attackers, mystified by the protagonist's seemingly irrational behavior, asks of him, ""What's wrong with you?"" The young hero replies (paraphrased), ""There's three of you picking on one guy. And you're asking what's wrong with ME?"" This scene, stunning in its ferocity and courage, perfectly captures the heart that ""Kick-Ass"" possesses.But let's not forget that this movie is also laugh-out-loud funny, particularly with the absurdities portrayed by the odd little man best known as ""McLovin"". Nick Cage's performance is also outstanding, but it's the young Chloe Grace Moretz, who is a force of nature, despite her diminutive size.

1305810,A19O1QVH7K39H0,B002ZG983M,Glen Hubbard,"[5, 7]","I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! I have not seen the DVD or Blu-Ray, as they are not released yet, but I had to review this.I was talking with some co-workers and they told me they thought it would be like ""Mystery Men"". Though I like that movie too, this movie has more in common with ""the Matrix"" than ""Mystery Men"". I told them that before I saw it, and I was right. This movie is a kind of a kind of a Kill Bill version of Spiderman with more humor added. There is lots of comic relief, and that comedy is essential to the plot and pacing of the movie as a whole, but this is NOT simply a comedy. It IS, however, a boatload of FUN!It is essentially the meshing of two stories that both have the same premise: ""What would happen if someone actually tried to be a super hero?""In one story we get the tale of an everyman high school kid who loves comic books. He wants to ""put on a suit and help people"". He's a dreamer that means well, but is generally incompetent. So this part of the story is based on what happens when his fantasy gets smacked in the face by the cold hard fist of reality.The second story is the tale of a competent and smart man that is horribly wronged and seeks revenge. The catch is he has a very young daughter. Like Lone Wolf and Cub he decides to take her with him on his planned journey to hell, only he is smart enough to give her the tools she will need to survive the trip. This part of the story is simple and pure, and you have seen it many times before. The film makers wisely don't embelish it to much, but we do get some exposition and notworthy scenes. Most of this story is left in subtext.So, what happens when the two stories collide? AWESOMENESS! This is written and performed so well that the stories simply mesh without clashing. I have never seen anything pull this off so well. There are plenty of gritty semi-realistic action scenes, and a little bit of ridiculousness thrown in for good measure. This movie Satisfies with a capital S. The violence is slightly more graphic than the Matrix, but not as intense as Sin City, 300, or Kill Bill. Yes, profanity is there, but there are not as many F-Bombs being dropped as I have seen reported. It's just that much of the profanity comes from the mouth of an 11 year old girl... (Which by the way should not even be allowed to SEE this movie for another 4-5 years!) You should definitely watch it before you allow any child of yours under 16 see it! COME ON! Be a parent already!I want to add: I saw the Dark Knight movie and I recognized it was a groundbreaking piece of work, but when I left the theatre afterward I just felt depressed. Where was the fun? It was a good movie, but I did not enjoy it, and have not seen it since. Kick-Ass is both an awesome movie and a GREAT TIME! I left the theatre just thinking how soon could I see it again, and who could I share it with next time.There is at least one reviewer that panned this film because it was not EXACTLY the same as the graphic novel. I used to be like that too, but now I realize that some things work better on the big screen than in a book. He lists the changes, and from what he states, I think I like the movie better than the book. I never read the graphic novel and I am glad I saw the movie first. From his description, I may have skipped the movie had I read the comic first. He complains and gripes that he hates when movies change comics. This is unwarranted. I have seen an interview with the writers that basically state that the screenplay was written more or less concurrently with the comic, just that Millar was primary in writing the comic while Vaughn was primary in writing the screenplay. They collaborated throughout on both, and a movie was always in mind. So, that comic book ""purist"" needs to get a life! THIS MOVIE ROCKS!The director needs to do more films, and he, Chloe Moretz and Nicholas Cage deserve Oscar nods, but it won't happen. Hit Girl is written to steal the show, but it could not have been done so well without Chloe's dead on performance. There is not a bad performance in this film.

It flies in the face of what critics like Roger Ebert look for in a film. That is a literary change portrayed on screen.However, does a lack of such criteria make this less than a film? Does it make it less of a social statement on the culture of violence? Sometimes, a film can succeed in greatness without teaching you something about morality. Sometimes, a film succeeds on it's cold realism alone. Does that make an eleven year old assassin any more realistic?

But it's nowhere near as violent as, say, Kill Bill. Not many limbs getting hacked off. Nothing particularly disturbing, although there's implied violence such as a finger getting cut off. It's par for the course for any shoot-em-up these days. No bones breaking and poking through. So what's the real reason for their discomfort?Well, you do have a 10 or 11-year old girl mouthing obscenities. It is a little disturbing, but it's not plentiful, and it is within character - she's been trained by her ex-policeman Big Daddy. So yes, I wouldn't let kids watch this. She does plant blades and bullets into many baddies, but from the reviews I had expected her to routinely slice them in half. There's nary a beheading.It's a tale of ordinary folk trying to be superheroes. One doesn't do so well because he has no super powers to speak of - well, none of them do; Hit Girl and her dad do OK because of rigorous training. Kick Ass gets his ass kicked, though not as brutally as I was led to believe. Well, it's still painful. And there's a bittersweet friendship story in there as well, between Kick-Ass and Red Mist, son of the big bad guy.Underneath all this is a movie with humor, heart and an uplifting shootout at the end.",4,"Fun, but not for kids, but not that violent, but ...",1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,1327,"['Most', 'reviews', 'press', 'warned', 'kind', 'ultraviolent', 'slice-and-dice', 'flick', 'was', 'worried', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'violent', 'say', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Not', 'many', 'limbs', 'getting', 'hacked', 'off', 'Nothing', 'particularly', 'disturbing', 'implied', 'violence', 'such', 'finger', 'getting', 'cut', 'off', 'par', 'course', 'shoot-em-up', 'days', 'bones', 'breaking', 'poking', 'So', 'what', 'real', 'reason', 'discomfort', 'Well', 'do', 'have', '10', '11-year', 'old', 'girl', 'mouthing', 'obscenities', 'little', 'disturbing', 'not', 'plentiful', 'character', 'been', 'trained', 'ex-policeman', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'So', 'yes', 'would', ""n't"", 'let', 'kids', 'watch', 'plant', 'blades', 'bullets', 'many', 'baddies', 'reviews', 'had', 'expected', 'routinely', 'slice', 'half', 'nary', 'beheading.It', 'tale', 'ordinary', 'folk', 'trying', 'be', 'superheroes', 'One', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'well', 'super', 'powers', 'speak', 'well', 'none', 'do', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'dad', 'do', 'OK', 'rigorous', 'training', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'ass', 'kicked', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'brutally', 'was', 'led', 'believe', 'Well', 'still', 'painful', 'bittersweet', 'friendship', 'story', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'Kick-Ass', 'Red', 'Mist', 'son', 'big', 'bad', 'guy.Underneath', 'movie', 'humor', 'heart', 'uplifting', 'shootout', 'end']",N/A

It had some slapstick humor but the characters of the super hero were all very good except red-mist who really wasn't a super hero but just a phony wanna be. Towards the end, the film makes you want it to end. Great first half, Nicholas Cage kind of redeemed himself but he really is a bigger actor than all these films he's done recently. What happened to the man who made Leaving Las Vegas? I understand there's an age for everything but I'm happy he's bouncing back and this is definitely a step in the positive direction for him. My favourite thing about the film was the little girl with the cool purple hair, her attitude was amazing. She reminded me of the little sister to the main character in 500 days of summer.

1305815,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002ZG983M,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[13, 19]","Somewhere, Mark Millar won't be rolling over in his grave. That's because 1) he's not dead, and 2) his comic book KICK-ASS gets the jawdropping cinematic treatment. I lost my mind a couple of times while watching this film, and I plan on catching this sucker again ASAP. With a movie title like it's got, it must've been problematic trying to promote and advertise this motion picture. But it's so wildly entertaining that I've no doubt word-of-mouth buzz alone will propel it to box office supremacy. It's the definition of a water cooler movie.Step up. Take a stand. Make a difference. Be a person of conviction. Put on a costume. Kick asss. I don't want to spill too many things, and this film has so many terrific moments, especially if you're a die-hard comic book guy like me, and it'd be too easy to drop a spoiler. The story has things to say about how comic books impact our culture, how today's near instantaneous forms of communication give us instant gratification and a wider scope of influence. Our central character, Dave, his legend spreads like a virus.""With no power comes no responsibility... except that wasn't true."" Teenager Dave Lizewski says that later on in the film, but before that, at the start of the film, he and his loser pals are hanging out in a comic book shop and Dave wonders aloud why no one has ever tried to become a superhero in real life. Not too much later, he dons a colorful snorkeling suit (purchased on E-bay) and begins patrolling the city at night. Dave Lizewski has no special skills whatsoever. The first time he engages in a fight, he doesn't do too well, and this is probably more true to life than anything else that could've happened. And I guess Dave's super powers are good intentions and a certain undauntedness because he keeps on keeping on. His next skirmish, he becomes an overnight YouTube sensation.The first real-life ""superhero,"" Dave inspires other costumed vigilantes, and it's around this point, when we're introduced to Damon and Mindy Macready, that we know we're seeing something off, something audacious and subversive and just friggin' cool. The Macreadys form a father-daughter crimefighting team called Big Daddy and Hit-Girl, and, unlike Dave, this pair is the real deal; they're the scourge of New York's criminal underworld. Nicolas Cage breaks his streak of stupendously horrid performances to deliver a fair bit of acting. Big Daddy has got issues. He's obsessed with taking down a New York crime lord (Mark Strong), and yet he also loves his adorable eleven-year-old daughter whom, by the way, he's trained to be an unstoppable killing machine from an early age. For her birthday, he gives her twin butterfly knives. That is some crazy, disturbed fatherly love. If nothing else, Cage as Big Daddy also occasionally launches into a pretty nifty homage to Adam West.Not that the film stays strictly faithful to its source. Little things were altered here and there, and two big plot elements were significantly altered, one referring to Dave's personal high school life, the other is in regards to a relevant side character. I can't say much more than that, other than I can sort of see why those changes were made for the film.Here, eat some adjectives: Irreverent, satiric, hilarious, profane, dysfunctional, and uber-violent, although not as violent or gory as Millar's comic book. This film is family friendly in the same way that Big Daddy demonstrates admirable parenting skills. The screenplay is sharp; the soundtrack fits the moments. The movie simultaneously lampoons and wallows in its comic book roots, and the opening scene sets the tone. The cast is great; the other actors do exceedingly well (British guy Aaron Johnson plays Dave Lizewski just right), but let's not fcuk around here, young Chloe Moretz steals this movie, and hers is the breakout character by far. Hit-Girl, eleven years old and gleefully ending people's lives with this big grin on her face, has to be, just has to be, one of the baddest, most lethal, most potty-mouth superheroes ever put to cinema. Sue me for being inappropriate, but all those just-mentioned qualities add up to one big ball of awesome. Hit-Girl is bananas.By the way, John Romita, Jr. also won't be rolling over in his grave, for the same reasons cited above.The DVD's bonus features include: a pretty dry but informative audio commentary by director Matthew Vaughn, ""It's On! The Comic Book Origin of KICK-ASS"" - a documentary nicely exploring KICK-ASS's comic book roots and including interviews with co-creators Mark Millar and John Romita, and Jr, inker Tom Palmer and colorist Dean White - and we also get to see the art process as it goes from pencils to inks to colors (00:20:34 minutes); the Art of KICK-ASS - still segments dedicated to Storyboards, Costumes, On-Set Photography, Production Design, and John Romita, Jr's Art for the film; and the marketing archive (comprised of the theatrical trailer, the profanity-laced Redband Hit Girl trailer, and promotional movie posters and images produced for the North American and International campaigns).",5,"""What the f--- are you supposed to be?

1305819,A1E11HKN4IRY09,B002ZG983M,Hogarth Hughes,"[0, 0]","Wow.Back in 1987 I went to the theater to see the movie ROBOCOP. I left the theater so pleasantly surprised, I couldn't fathom why this classic film could be marketed so wrongly. Even the name ROBOCOP suggests something uber-cheesy. I was totally exhilarated by ROBOCOP and the complex, funny, and character driven script that led to the great film I had viewed. I feel exactly the same about KICK-ASS. I had zero desire to see this film in it's theatrical release. All based on advertising. I had expected something as cheesy and kid friendly as SPIDERMAN 1, 2, or 3. What was delivered to me was one of the most chaotic, unapologeticly adult oriented flicks I've ever been privy to view.

Yes, Kick Ass does kick all that ass, cliche joke out of the way, let's begin.I'm not a real big fan of conventional superhero movies, but don't get me wrong, there have been a few that I actually enjoyed, for example; Superman 1,2, Returns and Man of Steel, All Of The Batman Movies (Sans Forever and Batman and Robin), Spiderman 2, and even The Avengers was pretty cool. This movie is not a conventional superhero movie in the least, and in that, it is amazing.There was so much I loved about this movie.The tititual character was great. I felt like he was a perfect way for the audience to connect with the main situation in the movie and the other superheroes we meet along the way.You're probably gonna here this from everyone who saw the movie; Hit Girl made this movie.Of the characters in this film, she was the best, the most bad ass, the most irreverent, and the most kick ass (it's a cliche joke, but if it ain't broke, than don't fix it). If I ever put together a top 10 Comic Book/Graphic Novel Characters List, she is definitely on there.Nicholas Cage was awesome as well. It's been a whiles since i've seen him in a movie and said that.His character &#34;Big Daddy&#34; was a bad ass; if I could describe him, he was like a gun wielding Batman with a sense of humor.The main villain in this movie worked for the story. I do realize that in a story like this, it's gonna be a little bit of time before we see super villains (I heard that McLovin i.e. the main villains son in this film, is a villain in the second movie, and that got me excited)I think the reason why this movie worked so well was excuse of how well written it was. The fact that they where able to connect the story to real life only made the movie that much more awesome, because hey, at one point or another, we've all wanted to be a superhero (even if you're a girl, you thought about ti at least once).I can't call the movie flawless but per my opinion theres nothing I can call the movie out for; yeah everything and everybody did their job and they did it well, and I loved every minute of it. Put Simply, Kick Ass is one of my favorite superhero movies.So, Great Story, Awesome Characters, and a Damn Near Perfect Exposition; The Bottom Line Is Looking Strong and it is a94%- Executed with style, substance, and a flurry of terrific violence and an unbeatable sense of fun, Kick Ass is bolstered by excellent performances, a great script, and a completely and utterly original concept that will delight any and all who watch it.",5,Easily One Of The Greatest Superhero Movies Of All Time,1398211200,"04 23, 2014",2014,2574,"['First', 'foremost', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'live', 'up', 'title', 'Yes', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'kick', 'ass', 'cliche', 'joke', 'way', 'let', 'begin.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'real', 'big', 'fan', 'conventional', 'superhero', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'example', 'Superman', '1,2', 'Returns', 'Man', 'Steel', 'All', 'Batman', 'Movies', 'Sans', 'Forever', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'Spiderman', '2', 'even', 'Avengers', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'movie', 'not', 'conventional', 'superhero', 'movie', 'least', 'amazing.There', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'loved', 'movie.The', 'tititual', 'character', 'was', 'great', 'felt', 'was', 'perfect', 'way', 'audience', 'connect', 'main', 'situation', 'movie', 'other', 'superheroes', 'meet', 'way.You', ""'re"", 'probably', 'gon', 'here', 'everyone', 'who', 'saw', 'movie', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'made', 'characters', 'film', 'was', 'best', 'most', 'bad', 'ass', 'most', 'irreverent', 'most', 'kick', 'ass', 'cliche', 'joke', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broke', 'do', ""n't"", 'fix', 'ever', 'put', 'together', 'top', '10', 'Comic', 'Book/Graphic', 'Novel', 'Characters', 'List', 'definitely', 'there.Nicholas', 'Cage', 'was', 'awesome', 'as', 'well', 'been', 'whiles', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'said', 'that.His', 'character', '34', 'Big', 'Daddy', '34', 'was', 'bad', 'ass', 'could', 'describe', 'was', 'gun', 'wielding', 'Batman', 'sense', 'humor.The', 'main', 'villain', 'movie', 'worked', 'story', 'do', 'realize', 'story', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'time', 'see', 'super', 'villains', 'heard', 'McLovin', 'i.e', 'main', 'villains', 'son', 'film', 'villain', 'second', 'movie', 'got', 'excited', 'think', 'reason', 'why', 'movie', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'excuse', 'how', 'well', 'written', 'was', 'fact', 'where', 'able', 'connect', 'story', 'real', 'life', 'only', 'made', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'awesome', 'hey', 'one', 'point', ""'ve"", 'wanted', 'be', 'superhero', 'even', ""'re"", 'girl', 'thought', 'ti', 'least', 'once', '.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'call', 'movie', 'flawless', 'opinion', 'nothing', 'can', 'call', 'movie', 'everything', 'everybody', 'did', 'job', 'did', 'well', 'loved', 'minute', 'Put', 'Simply', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'one', 'favorite', 'superhero', 'movies.So', 'Great', 'Story', 'Awesome', 'Characters', 'Damn', 'Near', 'Perfect', 'Exposition', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'Looking', 'Strong', 'a94', '%', 'Executed', 'style', 'substance', 'flurry', 'terrific', 'violence', 'unbeatable', 'sense', 'fun', 'Kick', 'Ass', 'bolstered', 'excellent', 'performances', 'great', 'script', 'completely', 'utterly', 'original', 'concept', 'will', 'delight', 'who', 'watch']",N/A

I guess ratings have been relaxed since Kill Bill, a movie that has some similarities, was released. I thought some of the bloody scenes in Kill Bill were toned down with the use of black and white to get an R rating. Obviously, not required for this movie since you see all the bullet exit cavitation holes in glory detail in high-def so those without a strong stomach might get nausea watching this film. Anyways, if you can repress the repulsion at seeing an innocent way too young girl turned into a cold blooded killer like in Kill Bill, The Professional the visuals are very well done but that's about it. It seems as the write for the movie basically stole parts from the Matrix, Kill Bill, The Watchmen, Spider Man, Toxic Avenger, The Professional and make a mash up of them. Also, some references in the movie like MySpace, Lost, etc are already outdated thus making the movie stand the test of time even less. There was also some totally unnecessary masturbation and hot for teacher scenes at the start of the movie which added nothing to the movie. One of the problems I had with the movie is that it doesn't seem to make up it's mind if it's a comedy or not. I didn't laugh very much if it was supposed to be funny. I guess it must've been dark humor they were aiming for?Ass-Kick is in reference to what the Watchmen Batman copycat Nic Cage says to his little girl. He tells her that Kick-Ass should change his name to Ass-Kick since all he seems to do is get his butt kicked LOL. Now that was funny! But then there are parts where the movie gets all serious and even depressing when one of the main super-hero's get killed and even Kick-Ass himself seemed to get physically ill as this movie almost made me feel when he saw all the death the little psycho hit-girl unleashed. He wasn't the only one, even Red Mist almost threw up, after seeing all the blood and guts in this movie! This should be an obvious strong warning to anyone sensitive to blood, guts and gore!In the end I did see enough redeeming qualities in this movie to recommend it to those with a strong stomach.

Yes, Matthew Vaughn has a distinct visual style and has a sense of humor when it comes to musical cues. Yes, Chloe Moretz is great as Mindy/Hit-Girl. And yes, you can make a successful film based on a comic without sticking straight-up to the source material.But here's the problem. KICK-ASS (at least this volume) is a limited series. When you have decades of mythology, you can play with that a little and still make a great film (SUPERMAN 1 and 2, The Nolan BATMAN films, the first 2 X-MEN films, the first 2 SPIDER-MAN films... and more). But when you have a mini-series, like WATCHMEN, V FOR VENDETTA, LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, FROM HELL (basically anything adapted from an Alan Moore original work)... and you screw around with the plot, characters, and the moments that make those comics transcendental of the four-color genre, you lose most of, if not ALL of the things that make those titles great... which all of those afore-mentioned films did. KICK-ASS, as a comic, lasted for eight issues and those eight issues were great fun. It didn't take itself terribly seriously, and it made you laugh at its extremes. But it worked. There was no futuristic technology, no powers... just people with tazers, clubs, guns and swords. And that was it.Now, as we follow Dave Lizewski on his journey to become the first fanboy-turned-superhero, we're intrigued and amused at how much he sucks at fighting crime. Then when he does something sort of right, his antics are caught on YouTube and masked heroes become a sensation. Satiricially, this is a brilliant setup.But then the filmmakers, and to some extent, the original writer Mark Millar himself, decided to screw around with this story, and add, change, or remove  elements that took away from some of the things that made the book great.And I was lost. I couldn't for the life of me understand why this film decided to stray from the source material so heavily in three major moments: The actual origin of Big Daddy (which is VERY different in the book), the ""love"" story between Dave and his crush, and the finale. Well, one particular moment in the finale that COMPLETELY took me out of the film and just made me shake my head in disappointment. Hint: it involves technology that does NOT exist in our real world.And Christopher Mintz-Plasse? Trying tooooooo hard. And I'm just so tired of Nicolas Cage. He should have retired after he won his Oscar, because he hasn't turned in anything vaguely resembling a good performance since then, with the exception of FACE/OFF.These were all things that hit me after the credits for the film rolled and I was on my way out to the parking lot, but they were major differences that were done for purely stylistic purposes, and did nothing but hurt the chances for this film to be everything it could have been.I try really hard not to be a purist, because I know that films can stand apart from their source material, but when you change things that work in the place of things that don't... that's when you really screw your film up.

1305837,A1ZR8F86DJRVLX,B002ZG983M,Jason Bean,"[6, 10]","I find Kick-Ass a hard movie to judge. It's a superhero satire/parody which manages to poke fun of everything from superhero movies to real life monotony. It's got some fun and (purposely) offensive ideas which can (and did) offend as many people as it entertains. While I thought Kick-Ass started off fun with a great in-your-face attitude it burns itself out pretty quickly. Too much of a good thing maybe?The story of Kick-Ass more or less follows the comic with some entertaining embellishments. Dave is a high school nerd who decides to throw on a costume and fight crime. After eventually taking down some hoodlums he becomes an internet sensation on Youtube and manages to attract 'real' superhero Big Daddy and his 11-year old daughter Hit Girl. Big Daddy and Hit Girl are trying to take down a local mafioso and Dave ends up getting in over his head. Kick-Ass's story has got some great gags and like most send-ups is played for laughs, though I actually found the situations the characters got into (and the observations of society and internet culture) more funny than any of the actual dialogue or the over-the-top action.The acting in Kick-Ass is great all around. Aaron Johnson is perfectly relatable as Dave and strikes a sort of anti-Peter Parker vibe. Nicholas Cage is fun and campy as Big Daddy and Chloe Moretz steals every scene as Hit Girl. Mark Strong has proved himself capable at playing a villain and is no less effective as the mafioso in Kick-Ass.The action scenes in Kick-Ass are very slick and very violent. A lot of people were put off by seeing Hit Girl killing and mutilating bad-guys as well as being physically tortured later in the film. If you are offended by  this then probably best to stay away as most of the last third of the film is filled with these scenes. I personally have seen much more offensive scenes (in much BETTER films) so it didn't really effect my enjoyment.One thing as a comics fan I loved about Kick-Ass was the use of color. Every character in this film whether in superhero costume or civilian clothes looks like they were pulled straight from a comic book ( I also like the 'comic-panel' subtitles).While I liked Kick-Ass for the most part I did feel a bit burned out by the end. The movie keeps introducing wackier and more violent action and situations and keeps going on for almost two hours! Maybe I'm being too harsh but when a film is simply being played for yucks without introducing anything new it starts to feel like it's wasting my time. It's like a comedian that tells a sick but funny joke but instead of building on it just tells the same joke over and over again making it raunchier and raunchier.Obviously I'm in the minority with my luke-warm opinion of Kick-Ass. Like I said, there's a lot of fun to be had with this film but if it's just playing itself for laughs why go on for so long?",3,Fun but goes on too long,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,2867,"['find', 'Kick-Ass', 'hard', 'movie', 'judge', 'superhero', 'satire/parody', 'poke', 'fun', 'everything', 'superhero', 'movies', 'real', 'life', 'monotony', 'got', 'fun', 'purposely', 'offensive', 'ideas', 'can', 'did', 'offend', 'many', 'people', 'thought', 'Kick-Ass', 'started', 'off', 'fun', 'great', 'in-your-face', 'attitude', 'out', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'Too', 'much', 'good', 'thing', 'maybe', 'story', 'Kick-Ass', 'more', 'less', 'comic', 'entertaining', 'embellishments', 'Dave', 'high', 'school', 'nerd', 'who', 'decides', 'throw', 'costume', 'fight', 'crime', 'eventually', 'taking', 'down', 'hoodlums', 'internet', 'sensation', 'Youtube', 'manages', 'attract', ""'real"", 'superhero', 'Big', 'Daddy', '11-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'are', 'trying', 'take', 'down', 'local', 'mafioso', 'Dave', 'up', 'getting', 'head', 'Kick-Ass', 'story', 'got', 'great', 'gags', 'most', 'send-ups', 'played', 'laughs', 'actually', 'found', 'situations', 'characters', 'got', 'observations', 'society', 'internet', 'culture', 'more', 'funny', 'actual', 'dialogue', 'over-the-top', 'action.The', 'acting', 'Kick-Ass', 'great', 'around', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'perfectly', 'relatable', 'Dave', 'sort', 'anti-Peter', 'Parker', 'vibe', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'fun', 'campy', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'steals', 'scene', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'proved', 'capable', 'playing', 'villain', 'less', 'effective', 'mafioso', 'Kick-Ass.The', 'action', 'scenes', 'Kick-Ass', 'are', 'very', 'slick', 'very', 'violent', 'lot', 'people', 'were', 'put', 'off', 'seeing', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'killing', 'mutilating', 'bad-guys', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'physically', 'tortured', 'later', 'film', 'are', 'offended', 'then', 'probably', 'best', 'stay', 'away', 'most', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'filled', 'scenes', 'personally', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'more', 'offensive', 'scenes', 'much', 'BETTER', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'effect', 'enjoyment.One', 'thing', 'comics', 'fan', 'loved', 'Kick-Ass', 'was', 'use', 'color', 'character', 'film', 'superhero', 'costume', 'civilian', 'clothes', 'were', 'pulled', 'straight', 'comic', 'book', 'also', ""'comic-panel"", 'subtitles', '.While', 'liked', 'Kick-Ass', 'most', 'part', 'did', 'feel', 'bit', 'burned', 'out', 'end', 'movie', 'introducing', 'wackier', 'more', 'violent', 'action', 'situations', 'going', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'harsh', 'when', 'film', 'simply', 'being', 'played', 'yucks', 'introducing', 'anything', 'new', 'feel', 'wasting', 'time', 'comedian', 'sick', 'funny', 'joke', 'instead', 'building', 'just', 'same', 'joke', 'over', 'again', 'making', 'raunchier', 'raunchier.Obviously', ""'m"", 'minority', 'luke-warm', 'opinion', 'Kick-Ass', 'said', 'lot', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'film', 'just', 'playing', 'laughs', 'why', 'go', 'so', 'long']",N/A
1305838,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B002ZG983M,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[5, 7]","Dave Linewski (Aaron Johnson) is your everyday average 17 year old nerd. Girls don't notice him, thugs steal his money, him and his friends sit out around at comic book shops reading comics and talking about girls and why people never become superheroes. After getting fed up with the crime in his city, though, Dave decides to take matters into his own hands and becomes his own masked hero: Kick-Ass, and becomes a local web and news sensation. Things aren't as easy as they seem for a juvenile crime fighter as he soon finds out, luckily he makes friends in the form of Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage), a Batman-like vigilante, and his 11-year-old sidekick Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) who aren't adverse to the idea of literally taking out the scum of the earth. But when members of his crew start turning up dead, drug kingpin Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) puts a price on Kick-Ass's head.Mark Millar is an acclaimed comic writer best known for Wanted (which became the movie starring Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy) and his take on an alternate reality where Kal-El landed in the Soviet Union instead of America called Superman: Red Son. For Kick-Ass, Millar went back to conversations him and his brother had about becoming masked vigilantes, and took the conversation a step further and looked into what would actually happen if a teenager actually decided to take that step. As Millar got working on that comic, he also started working with Matthew Vaughn (director of Layer Cake, producer for Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrells) on some early ideas for Thor, but when Vaughn left Thor he started talking to Millar about his other comics. What started out as a plan to adapt American Jesus (Millar's sequel to the Bible) soon turned to conversations about Millar's still in the planning stage Kick-Ass.Kick-Ass is the anti-comic book comic book movie. It skewers the genre while also paying loving homage to them. It would be all to easy to say it's a spoof of the genre, because while at times it may poke fun at the genre (remember that scene in Spider-Man where Peter Parker runs across a rooftop and jumps to the next roof, there's a spoof of that) it still also takes it's place amongst it's comic book peers with all seriousness. Kick-Ass is a very dark movie, not afraid of withholding the violence that a choice of vigilante crime fighting will lead to, even if that means beating an 11-year-old girl. This is graciously offset by a lot of comedy, chances are if you're not cringing from people's limbs getting hacked off or their heads exploding (yes there is one scene where that actually does happen) you'll be laughing hysterically. Not to mention pointing out to yourself homages to other comic book iterations (the aforementioned rofftop run, Big Daddy's Adam West like cadence when talking in the suit, Kick-Ass in an alley staring up at a wall as if about to scale it like Peter Parker, etc.)The acting in the movie is phenomenal. Nicholas Cage hasn't been this good in years, and I was personally surprised to find out Aaron Johnson, who plays the title character, is actually a Brit. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad, Role Models) continues to surprise, considering most actors his age would have been typecast by a role like McLovin, and his arc actually did surprise having seen all of the trailers and promotional material for the movie prior to seeing the movie. The movie, though, is completely stolen by Chloe Moretz ((500) Days of Summer) as the foul mouthed, butt kicking 11-year-old Hit Girl. She plays the role with such force that you genuinely believe that full grown men, mafiosos, would be afraid of this 11-year-old girl.Naturally, this movie isn't for everyone, as we've seen from the brouhaha that's erupted for a little girl uttering the ""C-word"", but this is one movie I think it's rewarding to see below the surface. There's a certain hint of satire in it's brutality meeted out by a child, and a certain tone in the movie that chastises us for not being more involved in helping those around us, while also showing it's understanding of why we sometimes choose not to. I honestly can say that I can find nothing wrong with this movie, and I'm currently considering adding it to my top 10 all-time favorites list.

Kick-ass lives up to its name when you're introduced to hit girl played by Chloe Moretz and Nicolas Cage as big daddy. The two are experts with all guns and explosives, and stabbing weapons. Big Daddy, or Damon Macready, trains his little daughter to be a killer with the ultimate goal of putting an end to mob king Frank D'amico played by Mark Strong. This includes some really ridiculous things like testing out bullet-proof vests on his daughter, and putting goals into her head like wanting deadly knifes instead of Barbie dolls. It caught me off guard, and never really was easy to watch.Hit girl does some troubling and sometimes outright wrong things in this movie. It looks like they have her swearing, and saying some adult things, although it could have been made to look this way but that doesn't make it right. The murder scenes are awesome, but deranged as they come from a little girl whose costume even has a plaid skirt. It really is strange how she behaves like a hardened, cool killer with an air of invincibility. It is a twisted tale of father and daughter with the intent on not fighting crime so much, but settling a vendetta.Kiss-ass is about Dave Lizewski, played by Aaron Johnson who looks like a young spider man. One day he orders a cape-less character suit and at first plays out comic book fantasies to himself. In ally's and on roof tops he prepares for the day when he will fight criminals. It becomes tragic, and real when he crosses young thugs and in trying to prevent a crime, kick-ass gets shanked and mauled by traffic. He survives with a new toughness. He can take a beating, and barely feels a thing. There is a realness and violence that makes these scenes serious, even though they are made light of later with jokes and funny situations.Instead of learning a lesson and growing up a bit, Dave sticks to his guns and once again helps out. He fights like rocky, taking serious blows that would knock the spirit out of anyone else, but he keeps fighting. It gets taped and put on YouTube by people who would rather watch than help, and Dave becomes an internet sensation. He loves the popularity gained, but this movie paints a serious world and soon Dave finds more trouble than he can handle.Kick-ass has some awesome music, which is a collaboration of many musicians. John Murphy is my personal favorite and the use a remix version of a song from 28 days later. There is more gun battles than straight out fist to face. There is a more serious danger to Kick-ass, that you wouldn't expect from a movie with teens and a girl that is around 11. It delivers in action and originality. It is shocking, and vulgar, and very unpredictable. I enjoyed this movie but thought some moments in this movie pushing the envelope. I do recommend this movie though, but it was not easy to do even though appropriately rated (R).",4,"some funny, ironic moments and some violent ones and some mobsters and lots of guns",1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,2952,"['Kick-Ass', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected', 'alot', 'more', 'violent', 'thought', 'involved', 'mobsters', 'Kick-ass', 'up', 'name', 'when', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'hit', 'girl', 'played', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'big', 'daddy', 'two', 'are', 'experts', 'guns', 'explosives', 'stabbing', 'weapons', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Damon', 'Macready', 'little', 'daughter', 'be', 'killer', 'ultimate', 'goal', 'putting', 'end', 'mob', 'king', 'Frank', ""D'amico"", 'played', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'really', 'ridiculous', 'things', 'testing', 'out', 'bullet-proof', 'vests', 'daughter', 'putting', 'goals', 'head', 'wanting', 'deadly', 'knifes', 'instead', 'Barbie', 'dolls', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'never', 'really', 'was', 'easy', 'watch.Hit', 'girl', 'troubling', 'sometimes', 'outright', 'wrong', 'things', 'movie', 'have', 'swearing', 'saying', 'adult', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'look', 'way', ""n't"", 'make', 'right', 'murder', 'scenes', 'are', 'awesome', 'deranged', 'come', 'little', 'girl', 'costume', 'even', 'plaid', 'skirt', 'really', 'strange', 'how', 'hardened', 'cool', 'killer', 'air', 'invincibility', 'twisted', 'tale', 'father', 'daughter', 'intent', 'not', 'fighting', 'crime', 'so', 'much', 'settling', 'vendetta.Kiss-ass', 'Dave', 'Lizewski', 'played', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'who', 'young', 'spider', 'man', 'One', 'day', 'orders', 'cape-less', 'character', 'suit', 'first', 'plays', 'out', 'comic', 'book', 'fantasies', 'ally', 'roof', 'tops', 'day', 'when', 'will', 'fight', 'criminals', 'tragic', 'real', 'when', 'young', 'thugs', 'trying', 'prevent', 'crime', 'kick-ass', 'shanked', 'mauled', 'traffic', 'new', 'toughness', 'can', 'take', 'beating', 'barely', 'thing', 'realness', 'violence', 'scenes', 'serious', 'even', 'are', 'made', 'light', 'later', 'jokes', 'funny', 'situations.Instead', 'learning', 'lesson', 'growing', 'up', 'bit', 'Dave', 'sticks', 'guns', 'once', 'again', 'out', 'rocky', 'taking', 'serious', 'blows', 'would', 'knock', 'spirit', 'anyone', 'else', 'fighting', 'taped', 'put', 'YouTube', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'help', 'Dave', 'internet', 'sensation', 'popularity', 'gained', 'movie', 'serious', 'world', 'soon', 'Dave', 'more', 'trouble', 'can', 'handle.Kick-ass', 'awesome', 'music', 'collaboration', 'many', 'musicians', 'John', 'Murphy', 'personal', 'favorite', 'use', 'remix', 'version', 'song', '28', 'days', 'later', 'more', 'gun', 'battles', 'straight', 'out', 'fist', 'face', 'more', 'serious', 'danger', 'Kick-ass', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'teens', 'girl', 'around', '11', 'action', 'originality', 'shocking', 'vulgar', 'very', 'unpredictable', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'thought', 'moments', 'movie', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'do', 'recommend', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'easy', 'do', 'even', 'appropriately', 'rated', 'R']",N/A

Though for me two stole the whole movie. First Nicolas Cage was simply great. His best movie since LORD OF WAR. Then there was Chloe Moretz as Hit Girl. This was a dangerous role playing a child who's killing people. I'm sure there's some in the media who will be appalled, but it's just a movie it has no bearing on society or the down fall of it. Chloe did a outstanding job blending he childishness with cold and calculating killer.

When crime has been happening thanks to gangster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), he orders a wet suit and decides to become a superhero named Kick-Ass. Although he has no superhero, he has metal plates in some parts of his skeleton and excellent fighting abilities with two clubs in his arms fighting whatever criminal and thug is out there. However, two of the city's well known superheroes such as Big-Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and assassin Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) begin to make a comeback since Kick-Ass has became a pop culture phenomenon as they start to kill some crooks by themselves as well as have Kick-Ass join them. The don's son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) becomes an anti-hero himself called Red Mist to lure the heroes into a deadly trap that can cost them their lives.Ultraviolent, hilarious and wild action-comedy based on the cult Marvel comic from Mark Millar! this one is basically like a satire on superheroes even on the very idea that what if superheroes existed in real life. The film has been controversial due to an 11 year old girl character killing people and cussing even though the actress is really in her young teens, i think this movie is a gory and relentless action packed bath of jokes and blood with ideas of course, this movie is a winner all the way.This Blu-Ray includes flawless picture perfect image quality and theatrical sound to it with great extras like Ass-Kicking Bonus-View, commentary, featurettes, art gallery and marketing.

I'm always on the fence when Hollywood decides to make a comic into a movie mostly because I'm always afraid they're going to butcher it (images of 'Wanted' flashing before eyes) so I usually end up watching them just to be sure that they paid the proper respect to the original story (Welcome images of 'Watchmen' flash before eyes). With Kick-Ass, they stayed pretty true to the original story even as far as the ultra violence goes because if you read the issues, it's pretty brutal. They deviated significantly with ""Big Daddy's"" story and also the relationship between Dave Lizewski (Kick-Ass) and Katie Deauxma his ""love interest"". I guess American audiences aren't quite ready to see how those stories truly unfolded cuz they most definitely did NOT happen the way the movie portrayed them but regardless, I still think they did a pretty damn good job with the movie. They went in a different direction adding a comedic element to the movie but that worked cuz throughout the movie I remember being shocked by the violence (in a good way) and also laughing quite a bit throughout. They definitely went a bit overboard with the whole jet pack gattling gun at the end there but all in all it's definitely worth the buy.

But just last year, something kept telling me to watch this movie. So finally I watched this after watching Scott Pilgrim. I did not like Scott Pilgrim like I thought i would, but after watching Kick Ass, I not only became a fan, but i completely embraced the idea of the movie. Kick Ass adds a lot more depth and poses the question: What does it really take to be a superhero?Directed by the brilliant Matthew Vaughn (review for X Men First Class coming soon), Kick Ass stars Aaron Taylor Johnson as the titular character Dave Lizewski ""Kick Ass"" and he was excellent. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays Chris D'Amico who later becomes Red Mist. He did a great job. Lyndsy Fonseca plays Dave's love interest Katie Deauxma, Omari Hardwick stars as Marcus Williams, Mark Strong portrays the villain Frank D'Amico, Nicholas Cage gives a very admirable performance as Damon Mcready "" Big Daddy"", and the person who I feel gave the best performance Chloe Grace Moretz as Mindy Mcready ""Hit-Girl"".The story line is a whole lot of fun; albeit, there is a heavy dose of violence, and a moderate amount of profanity, but then again, this movie is rated R. Kick Ass is not like any other superhero movie inrecent memory. It does have its similarities with a FEW other superhero movies, but it is completely original. It has humor, drama, action, and the right amount of good in all 3 of its acts.  And yes, it DOES Kick Ass.To close, I gotta say, I am not only impressed with director Matthew Vaughn and actor Aaron Taylor Johnson, but I am still amazed that after 3 years, this movie still feels like a new release every time I watch it. It is a great feeling when watching a certain scene in a movie, (that you have seen 1000 times) even when you know whats going to happen next, you still find yourself getting goosebumps. Whenever I watch Kick Ass, I still get those same goosebumps. It may not be considered ""epic"" or ""classic"" to everyone, but in my opinion those words fit this movie perfect.

1305868,A1U7R3ARZUHQ3C,B002ZG983M,J. Slavitt,"[0, 3]","I had no intention of watching this movie.  I've been a diehard comicbook fan since childhood and thought that it would denegrate the genre.  I have to give the movie it's due, in no small part because of Nicholas Cage, Chloe Moretz and Mark Strong.  Matt Vaughn does a good job of holding this film together because it could easily have unravelled at any number of points.  It's still a spoof on super heros and in that respect, I'll always be a little dismayed.  On the otherhand, one has to smile ruefully at the idea of a kid like Aaron Johnson going out and taking on the underworld -- as if any middleclass kid would even know where to find them in the first place...  If there is one thing about this movie that really bugs me -- admittedly my own hangup -- it is the depiction of Chloe Moretz as a cold-blooded killer and a ""good little girl"", much the way that Natalie Portman was portrayed in The Professional.  It's more than a bit unnerving to see an 11 year old girl shooting, hacking and stabbing people to death as nonchalantly as if she were taking gym class.  I know that it's integral to the part in this film and can't really be avoided, but we sit amidst Columbine, Virginia Tech and any number of other teen driven multiple homicides and it makes me cringe more than a little that this movie glorifies that kind of revenge driven violence even for pre-teen girls...  By the way, in case there are any women out there who think my objection has to do with the fact that Moretz and Portman are women, you're off base.  I have flinched just as much in the depiction of boys of the same age acting the same way.

1305870,A1LPTWPNBPZWJP,B002ZG983M,Kaan Vural,"[1, 3]","(I've never read Kick-Ass, so I can't speak to its status as an adaptation.)From a technical standpoint, this is an extremely proficient film. It's shot well, the music is excellent (barring the fact hat some tracks are derivative of other works, which I didn't know at first), the acting is solid, the cast is all curiously sympathetic, the emotion is viscerally powerful, and the action is incredible.For those who have never seen Kick-Ass and are unaware of its content, there are two things that should be made crystal clear.One is , and please, PLEASE keep reading after this because it's not all there is to the movie:This is exTREMEly violent. And I don't just mean that the violence is graphic. The violence is AFFECTING. I'm no stranger to violence in film, trust me, but every time someone was killed or even hit it felt like a slap in the face.Second thing:While the violence is extreme, none of it is gratuitous.Does that sound nonsensical? Well, let me put it this way. Every single scene of violence serves an important narrative purpose. And I don't mean that it just moves the plot.See, Kick-Ass is ABOUT violence. It's about how our glorified picture of violence doesn't hold a candle to the true, graphic horror of it. The main character, a kid who thinks he can be a superhero, soon realizes why our fantasies about superheroes can be childish and even dangerous. And every scene of violence is another step in the main character's voyage of maturity as he discovers this awful reality.To be frank, I liked the main character. I identified with him, in a way. He has a sort of courage and ambition that you just have to envy. And that was a strong part of why this movie affected me so deeply: it projects you into a movie, then proceeds to beat you up, stab you, cripple you, and do the same to others in front of you.I'm going to suggest something that's likely very false and maybe even irresponsible, but maybe I'm on the right track.I want you to expose people to this film.See, the big complaint with violence in film and games is that it's desensitizing: by distancing children from the horror of violence even as they passively or actively participate in it, maybe it makes them less horrified by the true evils of the world.I don't personally believe that, at least not in the way most critics of violence do. BUT:THIS FILM IS NOT DESENSITIZING.No question about it. Every moment is raw, painful, horrifying. But the reason it's horrifying is because it isn't pointless, and although it's shot well it isn't shot in a detached manner.In a way, it was almost a religious experience for me. Suddenly, I could see what people meant when they were complaining about violence in film. I've since become much less tolerant of gratuitous violence in films, but I'm still in awe of this one, PRECISELY because none of the violence is gratuitous to the main idea of the story.As I said, from a technical standpoint the film is just fine, though the tone shifts so wildly that I'm not even sure what you're supposed to feel at the end.I will raise one VERY annoying issue, though: the main character is mistaken by his crush for a homosexual, and uses this as an excuse to spend time around her. My problem has NOTHING to do with the homosexuality, but with the girl herself. See, during this time, the main character does things with the girl that, shall we say, she would consider much too intimate for interaction with a straight friend. Nothing sexual, but physically intimate. And when he finally confesses the truth, she's upset for about five minutes before she abruptly jumps to being his girlfriend.I'm not a woman, but as soon as I saw that I knew in my gut that NO girl would react this way - certainly not within that time span.This is something that intensely gets on my nerves, and here's why: because someday, something similar might happen in real life - and when that girl is rightly outraged, people might say ""Ah, you're just overreacting.""I'm not going to blame this movie for starting a trend or corrupting our youth or anything, but to spread these kinds of ideas WITHOUT being aware of them is just not the way to go. If nothing else, it's just astoundingly poor writing - a lite version of the idea that wives can't be raped.Stuff like that really irritates me. I can still watch Kick-Ass because I'm essentially aware of it and can tune it out. But please, PLEASE, make sure that people are aware of that particular problem. Just...stay aware.And that's really the point of watching Kick-Ass, in a way. It's an exercise in raising awareness. Mainly it's awareness of the true horror of violence and the nature of violence in today's society; but hopefully it can also be an example of how these unthinking mistakes can slip past our radar somehow.",4,"Fascinating, but WARNING!",1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,4790,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Kick-Ass', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'status', 'adaptation', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'extremely', 'proficient', 'film', 'shot', 'well', 'music', 'excellent', 'barring', 'fact', 'hat', 'tracks', 'are', 'derivative', 'other', 'works', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'first', 'acting', 'solid', 'cast', 'curiously', 'sympathetic', 'emotion', 'viscerally', 'powerful', 'action', 'incredible.For', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Kick-Ass', 'are', 'unaware', 'content', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'made', 'crystal', 'clear.One', 'please', 'PLEASE', 'keep', 'reading', 'not', 'movie', 'exTREMEly', 'violent', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'mean', 'violence', 'graphic', 'violence', 'AFFECTING', ""'m"", 'stranger', 'violence', 'film', 'trust', 'time', 'someone', 'was', 'killed', 'even', 'hit', 'felt', 'slap', 'face.Second', 'thing', 'violence', 'extreme', 'none', 'gratuitous.Does', 'sound', 'nonsensical', 'Well', 'let', 'put', 'way', 'single', 'scene', 'violence', 'serves', 'important', 'narrative', 'purpose', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'just', 'plot.See', 'Kick-Ass', 'ABOUT', 'violence', 'how', 'glorified', 'picture', 'violence', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'true', 'graphic', 'horror', 'main', 'character', 'kid', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'superhero', 'soon', 'why', 'fantasies', 'superheroes', 'can', 'be', 'childish', 'even', 'dangerous', 'scene', 'violence', 'step', 'main', 'character', 'voyage', 'maturity', 'awful', 'reality.To', 'be', 'frank', 'liked', 'main', 'character', 'identified', 'way', 'sort', 'courage', 'ambition', 'just', 'have', 'envy', 'was', 'strong', 'part', 'why', 'movie', 'affected', 'so', 'deeply', 'projects', 'movie', 'then', 'beat', 'up', 'stab', 'cripple', 'do', 'same', 'others', 'front', 'you.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'suggest', 'something', 'likely', 'very', 'false', 'maybe', 'even', 'irresponsible', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'right', 'track.I', 'want', 'expose', 'people', 'film.See', 'big', 'complaint', 'violence', 'film', 'games', 'desensitizing', 'distancing', 'children', 'horror', 'violence', 'even', 'passively', 'actively', 'participate', 'maybe', 'less', 'horrified', 'true', 'evils', 'world.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'personally', 'believe', 'least', 'not', 'way', 'most', 'critics', 'violence', 'do', 'BUT', 'THIS', 'FILM', 'IS', 'NOT', 'DESENSITIZING.No', 'question', 'moment', 'raw', 'painful', 'horrifying', 'reason', 'horrifying', ""n't"", 'pointless', 'shot', 'well', ""n't"", 'shot', 'detached', 'manner.In', 'way', 'was', 'almost', 'religious', 'experience', 'Suddenly', 'could', 'see', 'what', 'people', 'meant', 'when', 'were', 'complaining', 'violence', 'film', ""'ve"", 'become', 'much', 'less', 'tolerant', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'films', ""'m"", 'still', 'awe', 'one', 'PRECISELY', 'none', 'violence', 'gratuitous', 'main', 'idea', 'story.As', 'said', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'film', 'just', 'fine', 'tone', 'shifts', 'so', 'wildly', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'what', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'feel', 'end.I', 'will', 'raise', 'one', 'VERY', 'annoying', 'issue', 'main', 'character', 'mistaken', 'crush', 'homosexual', 'excuse', 'spend', 'time', 'problem', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'homosexuality', 'girl', 'See', 'time', 'main', 'character', 'things', 'girl', 'shall', 'say', 'would', 'consider', 'much', 'too', 'intimate', 'interaction', 'straight', 'friend', 'Nothing', 'sexual', 'physically', 'intimate', 'when', 'finally', 'truth', 'upset', 'five', 'minutes', 'abruptly', 'being', 'girlfriend.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'woman', 'as', 'soon', 'saw', 'knew', 'gut', 'NO', 'girl', 'would', 'react', 'way', 'certainly', 'not', 'time', 'span.This', 'something', 'intensely', 'nerves', 'here', 'why', 'someday', 'something', 'similar', 'might', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'when', 'girl', 'rightly', 'outraged', 'people', 'might', 'say', 'Ah', ""'re"", 'just', 'overreacting', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'blame', 'movie', 'starting', 'trend', 'corrupting', 'youth', 'anything', 'spread', 'kinds', 'ideas', 'WITHOUT', 'being', 'aware', 'just', 'not', 'way', 'go', 'nothing', 'else', 'just', 'astoundingly', 'poor', 'writing', 'lite', 'version', 'idea', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'raped.Stuff', 'really', 'can', 'still', 'watch', 'Kick-Ass', ""'m"", 'essentially', 'aware', 'can', 'tune', 'out', 'please', 'PLEASE', 'make', 'sure', 'people', 'are', 'aware', 'particular', 'problem', 'Just', 'stay', 'really', 'point', 'watching', 'Kick-Ass', 'way', 'exercise', 'raising', 'awareness', 'Mainly', 'awareness', 'true', 'horror', 'violence', 'nature', 'violence', 'today', 'society', 'hopefully', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'example', 'how', 'unthinking', 'mistakes', 'can', 'slip', 'radar', 'somehow']",N/A
1305871,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B002ZG983M,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[6, 33]","I really wanted to like KICK-ASS.  The premise and the apparent message of ordinary people standing up to villains and crime and making a difference was very, very appealing.  But honestly, the only reason to watch KICK-ASS is the 3 fight scenes with the little girl. That's it. End of story. Of course, they are very violent and bloody, so if you can't imagine watching an 11-year-old girl stab, shoot, and slice the legs off of countless thug-types who deserve it, then there's no reason for you to watch KICK-ASS.But let's say you've been tricked into seeing KICK-ASS or someone has threatened to post unflattering photos of you and your hamster on Facebook if you don't watch the entire flick.  So you're sitting there in an empty theater and what do you see? Well, for the first 30 minutes, you DO NOT see any superhero stuff. No, you see pointless drivel about how hard it is to be a nerdy teenager. You get to see the main character's masturbatory fantasies (literally and graphically). And you wonder how this schmuck could afford a $99 wet suit. Finally, right around the 30 minute mark, he dons his wet suit, gets beaten to a bloody pulp, and sent to the hospital where everyone believes he's gay. So now, not only is he a nerdy teen, he's a faux gay nerdy teen.But I haven't mentioned the plot. Oh wait. For 33% of KICK-ASS, that IS the plot.  For the other 66%, it is a lot of gratuitous violence and gore.I was really disappointed in KICK-ASS.  It could have been a really good, positive movie.  But it degenerated into teen angst, gratuitous violence, and copious blood pretty quickly.

1305874,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B002ZG983M,K. Driscoll,"[6, 8]","Kick-Ass is based on Mark Millar's 2008 comic book ofthe same name.  The story is adapted for the screen by director and producer Matthew Vaughn.  The film comes off as a tongue-in-cheek cross between some of the big budget American comic book based films of recent years and live action anime.  The action scenes, just like the film's many colorful characters and its outstanding soundtrack, ask to be taken seriously enough to care for its characters, but in the end are appealing enough as fiction to provoke the audience to laugh, cheer, and generally stay exciting from beginning to end.  The theater I was in gave a hearty applause to Kick-Ass when it ended, and that was deserved.  After all, who doesn't like it when drug-dealers get taken out by likable underdogs that the audience can generally empathize with.Kick-Ass follows high school age David (Aaron Johnson), an every-teenager who wonders why real-life superheroes don't exist.  This reminds me of a fantastic special on the Science Channel about how Batman could be real, but his life expectancy would be incredibly short, so there's David's answer I suppose.  Anyway, so David settles on becoming a superhero without powers; just a green wetsuit, some batons, a taser, and later some much more heavy duty weapons that would make the US armed forces envious.  Obviously this is a film that asks for some suspension of disbelief but to say David's evolution into superherodome is a hard road is an understatement.  He does meet some very interesting fellow superhero's along the way including Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and his little eleven year old girl Mindy, or Hit Girl (Chlo Grace Moretz).  Hit Girl brings the film's overall appeal to a whole other level and there is no doubt she will be a cult icon in years to come.  She curses at her opponents and then flips and dances around with her weapons in kind of a ballet of vengeance.  Legs are amputated, throats are slashed, and the back of heads are blown out all to the sound of the Dickies version of the Banana Splits Theme Song and Bad Reputation by, who else, the Hit Girls.  Finally, David meets fellow superhero newcomer Red Mist, who is complete with his own vehicle, the Mist Mobile.  Red Mist is played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse and is of course known most for his role as McLovin in the 2007 comedySuperbad, but if he didn't shake off type-casting as a nerdy Live Action Role Player in the underrated 2008 comedyRole Models, then he has done so here as Red Mist.  Mark Strong, who madeSherlock Holmesa far better film as that film's antagonist, plays this film's antagonist Frank D'Amico, and does a fantastic job in taking his role just seriously enough. He's a great villain no matter the genre.Kick-Ass has perfectly timed humor to hopefully place the violence of the film's action scenes into a different lens for its audience.  It's not easy to defend violence in a movie that is clearly trying not to be taken seriously unless the violence is used as comedy itself, and here that can certainly be argued.  Firstly, in several ways, Kick-Ass is a movie about revenge so the violence has some emotional purpose, however flawed the characters may be for employing it.  Secondly, the violence comes off as a cross between Japanese animation and three stooges slaptick humor.  It is certainly a mix that made me laugh very much.  The humor in the film is also strong in its dialogue and the general actions of its unique characters.  The cast seems to get it and I have no doubt that Mark Millar, who wrote the original comic book, was working very closely with Matthew Vaughn in making this a pure effort with every single detail fully understood.  Everyone working on the film was very likely on the same page.  Highly recommended, especially to those who can really appreciate it, and to those who think it might be kind of a family film because one of its most visible characters is an eleven year old girl, think again.",5,Incredibly Entertaining Mix of Action and Humor,1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,3961,"['Kick-Ass', 'based', 'Mark', 'Millar', '2008', 'comic', 'book', 'ofthe', 'same', 'name', 'story', 'adapted', 'screen', 'director', 'producer', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'film', 'off', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'cross', 'big', 'budget', 'American', 'comic', 'book', 'based', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'live', 'action', 'anime', 'action', 'scenes', 'just', 'film', 'many', 'colorful', 'characters', 'outstanding', 'soundtrack', 'ask', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'enough', 'care', 'characters', 'end', 'are', 'appealing', 'enough', 'fiction', 'provoke', 'audience', 'laugh', 'cheer', 'generally', 'stay', 'exciting', 'beginning', 'end', 'theater', 'was', 'gave', 'hearty', 'applause', 'Kick-Ass', 'when', 'ended', 'was', 'deserved', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'drug-dealers', 'get', 'taken', 'out', 'likable', 'underdogs', 'audience', 'can', 'generally', 'empathize', 'with.Kick-Ass', 'high', 'school', 'age', 'David', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'every-teenager', 'who', 'why', 'real-life', 'superheroes', 'do', ""n't"", 'exist', 'fantastic', 'special', 'Science', 'Channel', 'how', 'Batman', 'could', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'expectancy', 'would', 'be', 'incredibly', 'short', 'David', 'answer', 'suppose', 'Anyway', 'so', 'David', 'settles', 'becoming', 'superhero', 'powers', 'just', 'green', 'wetsuit', 'batons', 'taser', 'later', 'much', 'more', 'heavy', 'duty', 'weapons', 'would', 'make', 'US', 'armed', 'forces', 'envious', 'Obviously', 'film', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'say', 'David', 'evolution', 'superherodome', 'hard', 'road', 'understatement', 'meet', 'very', 'interesting', 'fellow', 'superhero', 'way', 'including', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'little', 'eleven', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Mindy', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'Chlo', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'film', 'overall', 'appeal', 'whole', 'other', 'level', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'cult', 'icon', 'years', 'come', 'opponents', 'then', 'flips', 'dances', 'weapons', 'kind', 'ballet', 'vengeance', 'Legs', 'are', 'amputated', 'throats', 'are', 'slashed', 'back', 'heads', 'are', 'blown', 'out', 'sound', 'Dickies', 'version', 'Banana', 'Splits', 'Theme', 'Song', 'Bad', 'Reputation', 'who', 'else', 'Hit', 'Girls', 'Finally', 'David', 'fellow', 'superhero', 'newcomer', 'Red', 'Mist', 'who', 'complete', 'own', 'vehicle', 'Mist', 'Mobile', 'Red', 'Mist', 'played', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'course', 'known', 'most', 'role', 'McLovin', '2007', 'comedySuperbad', 'did', ""n't"", 'shake', 'off', 'type-casting', 'nerdy', 'Live', 'Action', 'Role', 'Player', 'underrated', '2008', 'comedyRole', 'Models', 'then', 'done', 'so', 'here', 'Red', 'Mist', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'who', 'madeSherlock', 'Holmesa', 'far', 'better', 'film', 'film', 'antagonist', 'film', 'antagonist', 'Frank', ""D'Amico"", 'fantastic', 'job', 'taking', 'role', 'just', 'seriously', 'enough', 'great', 'villain', 'matter', 'genre.Kick-Ass', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'humor', 'hopefully', 'place', 'violence', 'film', 'action', 'different', 'lens', 'audience', 'not', 'easy', 'defend', 'violence', 'movie', 'clearly', 'trying', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'violence', 'used', 'comedy', 'here', 'can', 'certainly', 'be', 'argued', 'Firstly', 'several', 'ways', 'Kick-Ass', 'movie', 'revenge', 'violence', 'emotional', 'purpose', 'however', 'flawed', 'characters', 'may', 'be', 'employing', 'Secondly', 'violence', 'off', 'cross', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'three', 'stooges', 'slaptick', 'humor', 'certainly', 'mix', 'made', 'laugh', 'very', 'much', 'humor', 'film', 'also', 'strong', 'dialogue', 'general', 'actions', 'unique', 'characters', 'cast', 'get', 'have', 'doubt', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'who', 'wrote', 'original', 'comic', 'book', 'was', 'working', 'very', 'closely', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'making', 'pure', 'effort', 'single', 'detail', 'fully', 'understood', 'Everyone', 'working', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'likely', 'same', 'page', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'especially', 'who', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'who', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'kind', 'family', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'visible', 'characters', 'eleven', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'think', 'again']",N/A

KICK-ASS is a cornball classic that is definitely headed for a kind of immortality as a camp set-up of BATMAN and SPIDER-MAN. It's the story of ordinary Dave Lizewsky of Queens NY, who one day decides to take up the job of local superhero for lack of any other ambitions.Dave has problems being a superhero. Unlike Peter Parker/Spider-Man he has no unnatural super powers (except ""being invisible to girls""); he lacks the technological skills of Tony Stark/Ironman; and he has no millions to spend on creating a persona like Bruce Wayne/Batman. Instead, he buys a lime green wetsuit and mask from a sporting goods store, arms himself with a couple of wooden batons which he can barely hold, and names himself ""Kick-Ass."" He's strictly a bargain-bin superhero.His first ""assignment"" is to rescue a cat (""Mr. Bitey"") from a tree; he falls out and concusses himself. In his second assignment he tries to stop two punks from breaking into a car. They throw him a beating and stab him in the gut. While he's crawling away from the fight he gets struck by a hit and run driver.The run-down is serendipitous. Rendered largely neuropathic from the accident, he feels little pain, and most of his bones are replaced with titanium plates and rods. When he recovers, he goes back to getting a beating for crime, this time trying to break up a street fight. It's a draw, but someone posts the video online, and overnight, Kick-Ass becomes a folk hero for tryng to save the victim.What nobody knows is that two real superheroes, ""Big Daddy"" (in a Batman-like costume) and his sass-mouthed, weapons-qualified preteen daughter ""Hit Girl"" (think a four-foot Robin with purple hair) are terrorizing a gang of mobsters.In the meantime, Kick-Ass is reveling in his fame and enjoying his sweet new girlfriend. What he doesn't know is that the mobsters think he is the superhero who has been tormenting them. They try to lure him out by baiting him with a possible sidekick ""Red Mist"" (the superheroic names in this movie are intentionally lame), and this leads to the grand battle between Kick-Ass, Big Daddy, and Hit Girl on one side and Red Mist and the mobsters on the other.By far the best character is not Kick-Ass himself, but Hit Girl. One 17 year old character announces his plan to save himself for her; a reviewer says he wants to adopt her. Noble sentiments all.",4,"""Look for the signal in the sky.

This is how the story goes: Dave Lizewski, a comic-book fanboy, decides to take his obsession as inspiration to become a real-life superhero. As any good superhero would, he chooses a new name -- Kick-Ass -- assembles a suit and mask to wear, and gets to work fighting crime. There's only one problem standing in his way: Kick-Ass has absolutely no superpowers. His life is forever changed as he inspires a subculture of copy cats, is hunted by assorted violent and unpleasant characters, and meets up with a pair of crazed vigilantes, including an 11-year-old sword-wielding dynamo, Hit Girl and her father, Big Daddy.The cast led by Aaron Johnson (as Dave Lizewski / Kick-Ass), Christopher Mintz-Plasse (as Chris D'Amico / Red Mist), Mark Strong (as Frank D'Amico), and in standout performances, Chloe Moretz (as Mindy Macready / Hit Girl) & Nicolas Cage (as Damon Macready / Big Daddy) is great!

It's not something I would normally watch, but I have to admit I was curious about it based on the reviews.  I was so glad I picked this up.  This movie was fantastic; one of the best movies of 2010 by far.  There were some really stand-out performances by Nicolas Cage (Big Daddy), Chloe Grace Moretz (Hit Girl) and Aaron Johnson (Kick Ass aka Dave).  Dave's two nerdy friends Todd (Evan Peters from American Horror Story) and Marty (Clark Duke) gave great comic relief.  I have to admit, I was really surprised by the level of violence, but not enough to be turned off by the movie.  It's definitely an adult movie; not for the kids.Dave is your average teenage boy who loves comic books, hangs out with his geeky friends Marty and Todd, and has fantasies of becoming a super hero until he actually is one.  He gets himself into a lot of trouble and his new hobby soon becomes way too dangerous when he inadvertently pisses off a major crime boss.  He meets Hit Girl and Big Daddy when they save him from what is sure to be a death sentence.  In an attempt to gain his crime boss father's approval and bring back Kick Ass, Chris aka Red Mist pretends to be a friend to Kick Ass.  He soon realizes there is a much bigger threat to his criminal father's business and plans to take out Big Daddy begin.

1305883,A1YVPBDG2OFMD2,B002ZG983M,Leif Sheppard,"[0, 2]","Be warned: this review contains mild spoilers.Aside from Hollywood's neverending quest to remake every movie from the past fifty years, film producers have been in an unapologetic superhero mode since the late nineties, cranking out favorites from X-Men to Spider Man and back again (they're rebooting Spidey, you know). Still even more are on the way, evidenced by news of the upcoming Avengers and Green Hornet movies. As a result nearly every marginally successful comic book or graphic novel one can imagine has been optioned for a cinematic adaptation. Whether or not this is a good thing is debatable. Sometimes we receive an emotionally gripping, contemporary classic like ""Road to Perdition"" (also, coincidentally, released on Blu-Ray today). Other times we're presented with godawful tripe like ""Whiteout"". The less said about that one, the better.Personally I think it's a good thing, as there are dozens of sharply original, brilliantly innovative graphic novels that have yet to enjoy life on the silver screen. Every comic fan has their wishlist of favorites they'd like to see reinvented visually, and my personal choices are the ""Preacher"" and ""Grendel"" series. I'd love to see what a visceral director like Zach Snyder could do with either of those properties. But the trend in the comic book world isn't focused so much on actual heroes anymore, it's gradually shifted towards the 'everyman does the incredible' template.We certainly see this trend manifested in ""Kick Ass"", as well as films like ""Defendor"" and the more recent ""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"". I must admit, even being a comic fan, ""Kick Ass"" never featured on my list of most wanted comic-films. It's somewhat original, in that there hasn't been a deluge of comics revolving around a kid who decides overnight to become a costumed crimefighter, but the comic itself was a bit on-the-nose in its themes and more than a little puerile in tone. I found it pleasant light reading but rather forgettable. The problem is that there's absolutely nothing deeper going on other than what's on the page, and as a result it's something one could read and fully comprehend whilst simultaneously watching television or chatting on the telephone (both of which I did).Of course, I'm fast approaching 30, and it's clear this film is primarily targeted towards those in their early-to-mid teenage years (which bizarrely clashes with the hard R rating, I might add). There's the by-the-numbers plotting, cookie cutter gangster stereotypes, and a youthful cast of socially inept comic loving geeks and stunningly attractive girls. In the end, ""Kick Ass"" is a much less depressing film than ""Defendor"" and plotwise it even manages to be less ridiculous than ""Scott Pilgrim"", but it never quite rises above the barely-adequate comic that inspired it.The performances are strong, particularly Aaron Johnson as our everyman crimefighter Kick Ass and Chloe Moretz as the pre-teen, foul-mouthed baddie assassin Hit-Girl. Nicolas Cage is the greatest surprise here, being without question the most famed member of the cast, but also known for his occasionally spotty performances. Here, he masterfully plays a slightly twisted but unquestionably devoted father by day and the Batman-inspired Big Daddy by night, replete with awkward Shatner-esque pauses in his speech. Mark Strong can always portray a convincing villan, and his role here as gangster leader Frank D'Amico is no different. Sadly, the immensely talented Jason Flemyng is inexplicably wasted (his total screentime amounts to under two minutes).Even worse, the greatest detriment to the film is director Matthew Vaughn, primarily known for his close collaborations with Guy Ritchie and for directing both ""Layer Cake"" and ""Stardust"". Though ""Layer Cake"" is a fine British gangster thriller, Vaughn has been riding the coattails of Richie's success for far too long now. Here, for instance, Vaughn confuses overused tropes with stylistic innovation, inserts obnoxious licensed music tracks where they're not required, and splices the action scenes with so many cuts it's impossible to tell what's really going on.Thankfully, the crew in ""Kick Ass"" helpfully provided explosive CGI blood spurts to let the audience know who is getting killed in what fashion. Nothing in the action scenes, however, is as eye-melting and seizure-inducing as the extended sequence in which Hit-Girl activates a strobe feature on the flashlight attachment to her pistol. The resultant fast-paced flashes of bright white light against a pitch black background will cause most in a darkened theater room to shield their eyes in anguish for an effect that essentially strangles any possible excitement out of the scene to begin with.But the crux of the problem with ""Kick Ass"" is its wildly uneven tone, as if Vaughn could never truly decide just what sort of film he wanted to create. The film begins by engaging the viewer in a series of silly slapstick gags along with some lowbrow teenage humor from its high-school age cast, then suddenly thrusts the audience into the realm of bloody, brutal violence when a character is stabbed in the torso. As he staggers away, bleeding profusely, he's subsequently struck by a speeding car. The film strangely expects the audience to suddenly feel genuine pathos for characters the film itself never took very seriously to begin with.It's not only the one instance, either, the film consistently flip-flops between being violent, dark, and deadly solemn to being too ridiculously silly and absurd to take seriously. Another example would be the gangster characters, who are generally quite dopey and have names that sound as if they were inspired by the Seven Dwarves or the Spice Girls (i.e. Sporty Goon, Scary Goon, Baby Goon, etc.). That makes them sound like amusing and inept Dick Tracy villans, but these characters frequently spew foul language and commit cold-blooded murder. Suffice it to say that the moments ""Kick Ass"" ceases to take itself so seriously are always the best scenes in the film.The score to ""Kick Ass"" is really quite good, the very few moments it's allowed to make an appearance. The bulk of the film's soundtrack is comprised of licensed music tracks, which form a trippy mix of every genre in the book. It's painfully obvious they were stretching to achieve a highly stylized look and sound akin to Snyder's work, but Vaughn doesn't have the chops for this sort of thing. For every skillfully used track (i.e. the amusing scene in which the boys are cruising to the sounds of ""Crazy"" by Gnarls Barkley) there are three others that sound wholly out of place. Some film school teacher somewhere must still be instructing their students that placing decades-old classic crooner ballads within bloody, violent action sequences is still trendy, stylish, or otherwise interesting. Snyder did it with ""Watchmen"", and now Vaughn has inserted Elvis Presley's ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" during a climatic sequence in which Kick Ass is piloting a rocketpack with dual gatling guns blazing away.The Blu-Ray is presented by Lionsgate in a fittingly color-rish transfer that, while certainly not benchmark material, looks quite sharp and detailed. Included within the case are three discs: the Blu-Ray, a DVD containing a standard definition copy of the film, and the ubiquitous digital copy on the third disc. There are five special features on the Blu-Ray disc, which are as follows:1) ""Ass Kicking Bonusview Mode"" - An feature-length interactive commentary with director Matthew Vaughn that also includes bonus footage and interview excepts. To give a better idea - this offers the same basic function as the ""Maximum Movie Mode"" on Warner Bros. titles such as ""Sherlock Holmes"", ""Watchmen"", ""Terminator Salvation"", or ""Cop Out"". Vaughn's solo commentary track is also included sans the bells and whistles.2) ""A New Kind of Superhero: The Making of Kick Ass"" (1:53:04) - A sprawling making-of feature that covers every aspect of production, from casting to sound effects and even smaller details such as finding a suitable distributor for the film.3) ""It's On: The Comic Book Origins of Kick Ass"" (20:36) - This turned out to be my personal favorite feature, one which (obviously) covers the source material of the film.4) ""Marketing Archive"" - Includes two trailers (including the controversial redband Hit-Girl trailer) and a fairly extensive gallery of movie posters.5) ""The Art of Kick Ass"" - A huge photo gallery covering all aspects of the film's production.Ultimately, ""Kick Ass"" is an entertaining, action-packed summer film that nearly any teenager (or excessively youthful adult) is bound to revel in. My attention was held for the entire two hours, which is more than I can say for a good deal of recent flicks (I'm looking at you, ""Repo Men"") and despite my quibbles the film often amused me. The film has such an excellent, original premise that it's unfortunate the execution was somewhat botched.With that in mind, fans certainly won't be disappointed with the Blu-Ray presentation, but I'd advise a rental to those who haven't gotten around to seeing it yet. Were it not for Vaughn's scattershot directing, I would've been able to offer a much stronger recommendation. So, considering I'm not a member of this film's intended demographic, and it's certainly never boring, I think 3.5 stars is a fair rating (rounded up to 4 in light of Amazon's rating limitations). Besides, there was a time when I would've adored this film, it simply arrived fifteen years too late for me.",4,"""Kick Ass"" Blu-Ray Review",1280793600,"08 3, 2010",2010,9549,"['Be', 'warned',

Let the Right One In, the Wrestler & Adventureland immediately come to mind but at least those films warrant, save for Adventureland which only gets *, a worth seeing (**) rating whereas the newest addition to this list, 2010's Kick-Ass, doesn't even measure up the good deal of mediocrity found in those several films.Based on a comic I've never read, or had ever even heard of, and have no interest in pursuing, I decided to check this out solely to say that I'd seen it. I went in with no expectations, which was a wise choice, because I feel as if I had gone into this with some kind of expectations, oh I don't know a few laughs and some interesting ideas, the failure to meet them would have ended up wholely immeasurable.Aaron Johnson plays the title character, who makes a point to let us know that people like Spider-Man and Superman could never actually exist in real life (a statement as eye opening as the entry level philosophical ideas at play in David Fincher's equally useless film Fight Club.) and that he's just a regular teenager who possesses no luck with the ladies and spends the vast majority of his time watching TV, reading comics and jerking off (oh, strained reltability, how awkward and annoying you are.) The film wants to be something more than just another movie based on a comic, it wants to be the anti-super hero super hero film by injecting lots of realistic cynicism and black humor, but all of these attempts fall as flat on their face as the character in the opening shot who under the impression that his homemade wings will allow him to fly from the top of a skyscraper dies after crashing onto the roof of a car parked below.Eventually Kick-Ass, AKA Dave, finds out that he's not the only person in his city willing to wear an outfit and fight crime, there's a father and daughter team who are dedicated to eradicating everyone involved in the local mega-crime boss' syndicate. Roger Ebert lost his marbles over the film BECAUSEthe daughter in the team is a pre-teen, or 13 or something, and she delights in heavy weaponry, flowing profanity and expert headshots. Morally irresponsible he cried; painfully boring and trying way too hard cries I. There could be read the implications by the creator of the comic and the director of the film that the father in the team is beyond psychologically warped because he's brainwashed his daughter to become the NRA's wildest dream, a mini-Dirty Harry who dispenses of human life without a moment's thought or hesitation because they're the ""bad guys"", but that isnt' it, this is just a stupid little film without a single redeemable quality.Vastly inferior to Jody Hill's 2009 misunderstood near-masterpiece Observe and Report; a black comedy with numerous interesting qualities.",1,"Well, waddya know, turns out Kick-Ass sucks ass",1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,2934,"['Rating', 'WorthlessIt', 'lately', 'year', 'are', 'handful', 'films', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'people', 'being', 'truly', 'great', 'original', 'piece', 'cinema', 'Let', 'Right', 'One', 'Wrestler', 'Adventureland', 'immediately', 'come', 'mind', 'least', 'films', 'warrant', 'save', 'Adventureland', 'only', '*', 'worth', 'seeing', '**', 'rating', 'newest', 'addition', 'list', '2010', 'Kick-Ass', ""n't"", 'even', 'measure', 'up', 'good', 'deal', 'mediocrity', 'found', 'several', 'films.Based', 'comic', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'had', 'ever', 'even', 'heard', 'have', 'interest', 'pursuing', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'solely', 'say', ""'d"", 'seen', 'went', 'expectations', 'was', 'wise', 'choice', 'feel', 'had', 'gone', 'kind', 'expectations', 'oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'few', 'laughs', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'failure', 'meet', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'wholely', 'Johnson', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'point', 'let', 'know', 'people', 'Spider-Man', 'Superman', 'could', 'never', 'actually', 'exist', 'real', 'life', 'statement', 'eye', 'opening', 'entry', 'level', 'philosophical', 'ideas', 'play', 'David', 'Fincher', 'equally', 'useless', 'film', 'Fight', 'Club', 'just', 'regular', 'teenager', 'who', 'luck', 'ladies', 'vast', 'majority', 'time', 'watching', 'TV', 'reading', 'comics', 'jerking', 'off', 'oh', 'strained', 'reltability', 'how', 'awkward', 'annoying', 'are', 'film', 'be', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'movie', 'based', 'comic', 'be', 'anti-super', 'hero', 'super', 'hero', 'film', 'injecting', 'lots', 'realistic', 'cynicism', 'black', 'humor', 'attempts', 'fall', 'flat', 'face', 'character', 'opening', 'shot', 'who', 'impression', 'homemade', 'wings', 'will', 'allow', 'fly', 'top', 'skyscraper', 'crashing', 'roof', 'car', 'parked', 'below.Eventually', 'Kick-Ass', 'AKA', 'Dave', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'person', 'city', 'willing', 'wear', 'outfit', 'fight', 'crime', 'father', 'daughter', 'team', 'who', 'are', 'dedicated', 'eradicating', 'everyone', 'involved', 'local', 'mega-crime', 'boss', 'syndicate', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'lost', 'marbles', 'film', 'BECAUSEthe', 'daughter', 'team', 'pre-teen', '13', 'something', 'delights', 'heavy', 'weaponry', 'flowing', 'profanity', 'expert', 'headshots', 'Morally', 'irresponsible', 'cried', 'painfully', 'boring', 'trying', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'cries', 'could', 'be', 'read', 'implications', 'creator', 'comic', 'director', 'film', 'father', 'team', 'psychologically', 'warped', 'brainwashed', 'daughter', 'become', 'NRA', 'wildest', 'dream', 'mini-Dirty', 'Harry', 'who', 'human', 'life', 'moment', 'thought', 'hesitation', ""'re"", 'bad', 'guys', 'isnt', 'just', 'stupid', 'little', 'film', 'single', 'redeemable', 'quality.Vastly', 'inferior', 'Jody', 'Hill', '2009', 'misunderstood', 'near-masterpiece', 'Observe', 'Report', 'black', 'comedy', 'numerous', 'interesting', 'qualities']",N/A

Here's why it matters:Two words: Hit-Girl.  Or maybe that's one word. Whatever.  Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) isn't just an equalizer, she's a cross between Stephanie from LazyTown and Robin from Batman.  Hit-Girl is a descendant of the same violent breed of superhero that has been beating villains up for decades, except that she's an 11-year-old girl.  More importantly, she's a female superhero that isn't overtly sexual.  She's the next step up from the Powerpuff Girls. I realized that true Girl Power had come to superhero movies when Hit-Girl punched a grown man in the face with brass knuckles.Being a superhero has consequences.  We are reminded that Hit-Girl is basically a sociopath who has never been to school.  Hit-Girl views life as a video game, a point reinforced in first-person perspective through her nightvision goggles as she shoots and stabs her way through piles of thugs. Her father Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) is a cold-blooded killer who will slit his opponents' throats. Kick-Ass (Aaron Johnson) is so terrified of the mass slaughter the aforementioned ""heroes"" inflict that he vows to quit the superhero gig entirely.  It doesn't stick of course.It was a graphic novel FIRST. Graphic novels often trail movies, adding more detail that was left out.  Kick-Ass the comic was released before the movie, giving the entire plot away.  It doesn't seem to have harmed the film at all. Graphic novels may now become an official extension of movies as part of their development - storyboards and comic panels have a lot in common after all.Kick-Ass plays for keeps. Kick-Ass isn't so much realistic as it is gritty.  It dispenses with superhero tropes like superpowers and embraces the difficulties of secret identities, not having any powers, and getting hurt.  Kick-Ass gets so beaten up by an uncaring world that he lands in a hospital.  People die.  A lot.Part thoughtful meditation on the perils of our violence-drenched celebrity culture, part non-stop rollercoaster ride of every adolescent's superhero dreams, Kick-Ass is like one long movie trailer - all action without the boring parts. Kick-Ass is awesome, not because of just what it does but because of what it represents.

I thought the movie was well paced with a good amount of action, comedy and storyline.. plus the characters were great! Something enjoyable by people of most ages (though you might wanna leave the kids out for this one).One of the big surprises here was the Blu-Ray itself.. I guess I wasn't expecting too much, but Lionsgate really delivered. Clarity is incredible and has some nice (saturated) colors throughout. Almost comparable to Gamer and the Crank films on Blu-Ray with just how nice it looked. An easy 5/5 for me.Audio was also top notch - nicely uses all the speakers and will give a home theater a real workout.  I believe this was another DTS-HD MA 7.1 track from Lionsgate.Extras don't stop either.. you get the Blu-Ray, DVD and a Digital Copy (for your iPod/iPhone/iPad). I know some don't care for the DVD or Digital copy, but I'm definitely a fan.

I'm not familiar with the comic,so I cannot compare them. The trailer made it seem like it would be a fun superhero film for the family. Make no mistake, this film is not for kids.The main character, Kick-Ass, I found to be decent. I found him very funny and relatable in the beginning. He fantasizes what we all fantasize about . We all want to be a superhero. The problem is that when Hitgirl and Big Daddy arrive, Kick-Ass easily gets overshadowed. That's a problem because he's the main character. Hitgirl is awesome! She is easily the best part about the film. Chloe Moretz does a great job for a young actress. Big Daddy is also a fun character. This is easily Nick Cage's best role in years. Red mist is okay as a sub-villian. The villian played by Mark Strong is okay, but nothing special.The movie is funny and over the top, which is what the film is going for. So it does its job.

1305912,A3TUU89VLARB63,B002ZG983M,mm,"[2, 3]","One of my pet peeves about most comic book movies is the way they have a tendency to play down to the teens rather than the adults.  That's fine, and that's the target audience, and that's the nature of the beast.  However,Kickass manages to be a comic book story for adults.  This gives the movie a depth that most comic book movies (heck, most movies period)tend to lack.  Particularly that movies with explosions tend to lack.  Kickass is far more relevant to a conversation about the responsibility of a single person to make society better than anything since Watchmen (the graphic novel, not the movie).  And I hate to say it, because I loved that graphic novel, but Kickass does it better.Very simply, this is about a kid who gets fed up with seeing violence and decides to do something about it.  He runs into several other masked individuals and ends up embroiled in a lot of violence, mayhem and hilarity.  And that's worth saying again.  Kickass is flipping hilarious.  Sometimes you're laughing while simultaneously feeling disgusted with yourself for laughing, but that doesn't mean you aren't having a good time.However, bear in mind that the violence here is pretty graphic sometimes.  And while I adore Hit Girl, and totally want to be her when I grow up (which is sad, cause I'm already in my thirties), a lot of folks might have trouble with her character arc.  It gets a bit bloody, and if you're sensitive to violence with kids, this isn't the movie for you.Strangely enough, though, Kickass also manages to be warm--you get to see characters who are legitimately trying to make the world a better place, and sometimes they fail miserably. I'll be honest that at one particular point, I was almost moved to tears.  This is one of the rare films that I've seen this year that have actually walked that perfect line of heartfelt emotion, a mix of sophisticated laughter and laughter at someone who got kicked in the balls, and some truly kick ass action sequences.",5,Excellent,1278028800,"07 2, 2010",2010,1982,"['One', 'pet', 'peeves', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'way', 'have', 'tendency', 'play', 'down', 'teens', 'rather', 'adults', 'fine', 'target', 'audience', 'nature', 'beast', 'However', 'Kickass', 'be', 'comic', 'book', 'story', 'adults', 'movie', 'depth', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'heck', 'most', 'movies', 'period', 'tend', 'lack', 'Particularly', 'movies', 'explosions', 'tend', 'lack', 'Kickass', 'far', 'more', 'relevant', 'conversation', 'responsibility', 'single', 'person', 'make', 'society', 'better', 'anything', 'Watchmen', 'graphic', 'novel', 'not', 'movie', 'hate', 'say', 'loved', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Kickass', 'better.Very', 'simply', 'kid', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'seeing', 'violence', 'decides', 'do', 'something', 'several', 'other', 'masked', 'individuals', 'up', 'embroiled', 'lot', 'violence', 'mayhem', 'hilarity', 'worth', 'saying', 'again', 'Kickass', 'flipping', 'hilarious', 'Sometimes', ""'re"", 'laughing', 'simultaneously', 'feeling', 'disgusted', 'laughing', ""n't"", 'mean', 'are', ""n't"", 'having', 'good', 'time.However', 'bear', 'mind', 'violence', 'here', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'sometimes', 'adore', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'totally', 'want', 'be', 'when', 'grow', 'up', 'sad', 'cause', ""'m"", 'already', 'thirties', 'lot', 'folks', 'might', 'have', 'trouble', 'character', 'arc', 'bit', 'bloody', ""'re"", 'sensitive', 'violence', 'kids', ""n't"", 'movie', 'you.Strangely', 'enough', 'though', 'Kickass', 'also', 'be', 'warm', 'get', 'see', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'legitimately', 'trying', 'make', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'sometimes', 'fail', 'miserably', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'one', 'particular', 'point', 'was', 'almost', 'moved', 'tears', 'one', 'rare', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'have', 'actually', 'walked', 'perfect', 'line', 'heartfelt', 'emotion', 'mix', 'sophisticated', 'laughter', 'laughter', 'someone', 'who', 'got', 'kicked', 'balls', 'truly', 'kick', 'ass', 'action', 'sequences']",N/A

But Kick-Ass conveyed a real daydreaming stage of everyone's past.  An adolescent confronted with boring family situation, hormonal development, and getting to fit in a society geared for attention. A great way to get such attraction is do something about real life problems.  What else is more important to an adolescent than physical strength and security? Superman, why everyone likes Superman but no one ever tried to be one?The daydreaming of an adolescent to fly over physical boundaries and restore order to the tough neighborhood was not the only daydream in town.  Kick-Ass will soon find the real victim of drug crime whose daydream was fueled by a lost wife and a living drug boss for whom he wished total vengeance.  Big-Daddy and Hit-Girl will make Kick-Ass feel great about his wise choice to do good to make people safer.  Red-Mist added another layer of comedy with his sinister plot to drag Kick-Ass out of his ridiculous green suite. Red-Mist played a perfect role of a son of a ruthless drug dealer, wit, quick, but still principled and soft at heart. The dried up texture of Red-Mist and his nasal speech made him a perfect offspring of a notorious drug-pin.Aside from the intelligent design of the movie of playing in one of many daydreams of young people, sustained action, loyalty, betrayal, love, and growing up, the movie also expanded the horizon of physical defense to near perfection of safety to the witty and smart party.  The Hit-Girl was wired with plenty of electronic eyes and remote control to make her a robot acting with absolute immunity from getting injured.  Yet, all the genius and neat planning of Big-Daddy were foiled with trusting a geek bystander.The movie was tense and funny all along.

Boy was I way off, because it earns it's R rating many times over. I really had no intention of seeing this film until I saw the very positive reviews flowing in from the critics. Not that I always agree with them, but in this case I would like to thank them for getting my butt down to the local theater today.Parts of the movie reminded me of Watchmen. You have everyday people who are sick of bad things happening to good people, decide to put on costumes, have funny hero names, and then beat and cut apart the bad guys in a not so nice way. I actually thought it was rather tame in the gore department, compared to what I read about beforehand, but the violence and language is way too strong for kids.The acting is good from everyone. I liked newcomer Aaron Johnson as Kick-Ass himself. Nicolas Cage turns in one of his better performaces in a long time, though I think he was great in an over-the-top kind of way in The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is still doing his McLovin thing in every movie since Superbad, but it worked again. Mark Strong is kind of one note as the villain, like in Sherlock Holmes, but I think he's a little better in this role. The real star of the show is little 11-year-old, Chloe Moretz, as Hit-Girl. She is clearly the most memorable thing in a movie with a bunch of stuff worth remembering. As the daughter of Cage's Big Daddy hero, she spews out bad language, slices and shoots baddies by the dozens, and loves her daddy. I want one of my own.Kick-Ass is serious in tone most of the time, but there are some killer comedy bits and lines that had the whole theater erupting with laughter. The music is well placed in key scenes and the director/writer, Matthew Vaughn, did a fine job in creating a comic book film that should please both fans and non-fans of the genre alike.Even though it looks like Kick-Ass will come in #1 this weekend, it still feels more like a cult film to me. I can easily see this movie being talked about decades from now, much like Army of Darkness, but without the campiness factor.

Admittedly I had barely seen any previews and just new it was about some teenager pretending to be a superhero, but I thought it would be a comedy along the lines of Scary Movie, or Napoleon Dynamite.  I was wrong.Dave Lizewski is your normal average geeky kid.  Until he gets the idea to become a super hero that is.  Then he becomes a little bit more.  But being a super hero isn't all its cracked up to be when the crime starts fighting him back.  And then new super heroes start appearing on the scene, all with different agendas.  Dave feels a little over his head but can't help but get drawn in.Characters:Dave Lizewski/Kick Ass-Aaron JohnsonDamon Macready/Big Daddy-Nicholas  CageMindy Macready/ Hit Girl-Chloe MoretzChris D'Amico/Red Mist-Christopher Mintz-PlasseFrank D'Amico-Mark Strongand others...Nicholas Cage has his ups and downs for me, but I actually liked him in this.  I thought he did a great job and liked the voicings and expressions he used for his character.  It added to the comedic value.  Chloe Moretz as his daughter was also very good as well.  She plays quite a controversial character (young girl killing, swearing, etc.) but made it very believable.  That being said, the main character played by Aaron Johnson didn't really do anything for me.  He was important to the film but I thought he could have been better.  As it stands, I didn't really care what happened to him.  The bad guys weren't exactly intimidating either.As said before I had expected this to be more comedy.  While it was to an extent, I would peg it more action/adventure/drama because it did have a lot of serious parts.  Because of all that adventure though, there is a lot of gore and murder in this movie.  Those with faint constitutions may want to think twice before watching.  There is a lot of cussing as well.  For a plot I think this one was actually pretty good.  The movie has a point when it asks why more people don't try to be real superheroes and it does a good job of pointing out why that is.  A downside though is that the pacing is rather poor and this movie, despite being an action film, kind of dragged for me and spent to much time on irrelevant details.Not the best of movies but not the worst either.

Anything goes, and that is precisely why I read them on a weekly basis while growing up. The sixties were a different era of course, and I could only afford new books on Saturday. But I spent the entire afternoon reading them. It was a time to let the imagination roam unfettered. Time would seem as if suspended while you studied and imagined the world beyond a single frame or page. So with `Kick-Ass', I did exactly as I did so many years ago. Open it up, sit back and hopefully, watch in awe.The movie opens slowly, and a foundation is laid out. This is very important due to many not having read the `Kick-Ass' series. I had never heard of it. But the premise intrigued me and that was enough. So, in a sense, I was back to the Saturday afternoon atmosphere of seeing things for the first time, as they unfolded. And unfold they did.The rise of `Kick-Ass' was due to frustration with the status-quo. You don't have to be into comics to understand this. However, it is the second ingredient to becoming `Kick-Ass' (courage) that is uncommon. So young Dave (Aaron Johnson) has decided to change his world and the catalyst is the comic book super hero world he lives for. He creates an alter-ego `Kick-Ass' and sets out to make a difference in his world. Along the way, he'll meet allies, adversaries and find that recognition can be a two-edged sword.Each page of `Kick-Ass' yields additions to the film that are a surprise and very welcome. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is fine as the ignored son of the local mob boss (Mark Strong) who reckons he'll be reckoned with one way or another. Nicholas Cage plays a comic book writer who has the added task of raising a daughter (Chloe Grace Moretz) alone. Chloe is a young dynamo who also happens to steal the movie (apologies to all the talent assembled, she is that good). I'm not getting into the characters here because you really need to watch the movie and let the story evolve.The film is based on the Mark Millar comic book series. The writers worked closely with Millar . And for their efforts to bring forth a fresh and lively story to an old genre, writer Jane Goldman and writer-director, Matthew Vaughn have succeeded wildly. Oh and there will be more of these movies to come, that you can be sure of. After all, there's a charismatic thirteen year old girl who simply must entertain the world, one more time before getting back to school.",4,"Kid Kicks-Ass, boy does SHE!",1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,2496,"['great', 'thing', 'movies', 'enter', 'realm', 'super', 'heroes', 'nothing', 'top', 'Anything', 'precisely', 'why', 'read', 'weekly', 'basis', 'growing', 'up', 'sixties', 'were', 'different', 'era', 'course', 'could', 'only', 'afford', 'new', 'books', 'Saturday', 'spent', 'entire', 'afternoon', 'reading', 'was', 'time', 'let', 'imagination', 'roam', 'unfettered', 'Time', 'would', 'seem', 'suspended', 'studied', 'imagined', 'world', 'single', 'frame', 'page', 'So', 'Kick-Ass', 'did', 'exactly', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Open', 'up', 'sit', 'back', 'hopefully', 'watch', 'awe.The', 'movie', 'slowly', 'foundation', 'laid', 'out', 'very', 'important', 'due', 'many', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'Kick-Ass', 'series', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'premise', 'intrigued', 'was', 'enough', 'So', 'sense', 'was', 'back', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'atmosphere', 'seeing', 'things', 'first', 'time', 'unfolded', 'unfold', 'did.The', 'rise', 'Kick-Ass', 'was', 'due', 'frustration', 'status-quo', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'comics', 'understand', 'However', 'second', 'ingredient', 'becoming', 'Kick-Ass', 'courage', 'uncommon', 'So', 'young', 'Dave', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'decided', 'change', 'world', 'catalyst', 'comic', 'book', 'super', 'hero', 'world', 'alter-ego', 'Kick-Ass', 'out', 'make', 'difference', 'world', 'way', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'allies', 'adversaries', 'find', 'recognition', 'can', 'be', 'two-edged', 'sword.Each', 'page', 'Kick-Ass', 'yields', 'additions', 'film', 'are', 'surprise', 'very', 'welcome', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'fine', 'ignored', 'son', 'local', 'mob', 'boss', 'Mark', 'Strong', 'who', ""'ll"", 'be', 'reckoned', 'one', 'way', 'Cage', 'comic', 'book', 'writer', 'who', 'added', 'task', 'raising', 'daughter', 'Chloe', 'Grace', 'Moretz', 'alone', 'Chloe', 'young', 'dynamo', 'who', 'also', 'steal', 'movie', 'apologies', 'talent', 'assembled', 'good', ""'m"", 'not', 'getting', 'characters', 'here', 'really', 'need', 'watch', 'movie', 'let', 'story', 'evolve.The', 'film', 'based', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'writers', 'worked', 'closely', 'Millar', 'efforts', 'bring', 'forth', 'fresh', 'lively', 'story', 'old', 'genre', 'writer', 'Jane', 'Goldman', 'writer-director', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'have', 'succeeded', 'wildly', 'Oh', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'movies', 'come', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'charismatic', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'simply', 'must', 'entertain', 'world', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'getting', 'back', 'school']",N/A
1305919,A1ER6IYOMM8VCT,B002ZG983M,"! MR. KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[14, 17]","I have wanted to see Kick-Ass ever since I saw the trailer over a year ago. What looked to be just another ""by the numbers"" sophomoric comedy turns out to be a brilliant and wickedly funny satire for adults.This film isn't going to appeal to everyone and I'm not here to insult anyone on either side of the fence. I enjoyed the film and I see nothing wrong with it. If you don't like it that's fine too and if you don't think your kids should see it, then don't let them, it wasn't intended for kids, but I do believe that trailer marketed it to look like a much more innocent film. The R rating should be enough warning for parents to get the idea that this film isn't for children.As far as the violence involving this young actress, I can remember many Little Rascal shorts that involved the rascals dragging adults across boards with nails in them or hitting them in the head with hammers etc, so this is not all that new to the world. I realize that this film shows violence that is way more graphic, but I also think we have become a little over sensitive and read way too much into everything these days.There were similar reactions to 'The Exorcist' and 'Pretty Baby' in their day and since Linda Blair and Brooke Shields seemed to have turned out OK I see no reason for such commotion. Everything is open to individual interpretation and depending on your age you may not realize that this has been going on since the early stages of filmmaking. I remember eight Shirley Temple vehicles called 'Baby Burlesks' she made before her wonderful feature films that portrayed 3 year olds as adults which I find much more alarming that this film.Now.....let's get to the movie. The casting is perfect with each of the four heroes having their own quirks and enough back story to propel this kind of film. Aaron Johnson plays the title character a Peter Parker type of nerdy school kid who without the aid of super powers decides he wants to fight crime. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays ""Red Mist"" another school nerd who's father happens to be a gangster boss. Nick Cage gives one of his best performances as ""Big Daddy"" an ex cop who was framed and jailed for 5 years and wants nothing more than to crush those responsible. He enlists the aid of his pint sized potty mouthed daughter Mindy A.K.A. ""Hit Girl"" played by Chloe Moretz who absolutely owns this film! Moretz shows incredible chops here not only as an actress, but as a stunt person, she performs almost all her own stunts and her performance is amazing. I know some see this kid's character as child exploitation, but really each child is different and some are more mature that others and it is her parents responsibility not mine to see to it she can handle such a role.While the film is extremely violent, it is portrayed much like in many comic books today which is a lot more disturbing than this film. I know that a lot of adults read comics, but comics are made for kids or at least that was their original intent, if comic books are going to have graphic violence, maybe there should be age restrictions on those too? I haven't seen an actual 'Kick Ass' comic book so I can't respond on how closely this movie portrays the comic, but I can tell you, this is easily one of the best comic book movies ever made.The Blu Ray combo pack has a slick looking transfer and plenty of behind the scenes features for fans. I hope that this Blu Ray DVD combo trend continues as I really like having both Blu Ray and DVD as I haven't fully committed to Blu Ray and it's nice to have both formats in case I want to watch this film as someone's home who doesn't have a Blu Ray.In Short Kick-Ass does just that all around!",5,EASILY ONE OF THE GREATEST COMIC BOOK FILMS EVER MADE!,1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,3676,"['have', 'wanted', 'see', 'Kick-Ass', 'ever', 'saw', 'trailer', 'year', 'ago', 'What', 'looked', 'be', 'just', 'numbers', 'sophomoric', 'comedy', 'out', 'be', 'brilliant', 'wickedly', 'funny', 'satire', 'adults.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'going', 'appeal', 'everyone', ""'m"", 'not', 'here', 'insult', 'anyone', 'side', 'fence', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'see', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fine', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'kids', 'should', 'see', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'was', ""n't"", 'intended', 'kids', 'do', 'believe', 'trailer', 'marketed', 'look', 'much', 'more', 'innocent', 'film', 'R', 'rating', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'warning', 'parents', 'get', 'idea', 'film', ""n't"", 'children.As', 'far', 'violence', 'involving', 'young', 'actress', 'can', 'remember', 'many', 'Little', 'Rascal', 'involved', 'rascals', 'dragging', 'adults', 'boards', 'nails', 'hitting', 'head', 'hammers', 'etc', 'not', 'new', 'world', 'realize', 'film', 'violence', 'way', 'more', 'graphic', 'also', 'think', 'have', 'become', 'little', 'sensitive', 'read', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'everything', 'days.There', 'were', 'similar', 'reactions', ""'The"", 'Exorcist', ""'Pretty"", 'Baby', 'day', 'Linda', 'Blair', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'seemed', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'OK', 'see', 'reason', 'such', 'commotion', 'Everything', 'open', 'individual', 'interpretation', 'depending', 'age', 'may', 'not', 'realize', 'been', 'going', 'early', 'stages', 'filmmaking', 'remember', 'eight', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'vehicles', 'called', ""'Baby"", 'Burlesks', 'made', 'wonderful', 'feature', 'films', 'portrayed', '3', 'year', 'olds', 'adults', 'find', 'much', 'more', 'alarming', 'film.Now', '..let', 'get', 'movie', 'casting', 'perfect', 'four', 'heroes', 'having', 'own', 'quirks', 'enough', 'back', 'story', 'propel', 'kind', 'film', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'title', 'character', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'type', 'nerdy', 'school', 'kid', 'who', 'aid', 'super', 'powers', 'fight', 'crime', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'Red', 'Mist', 'school', 'nerd', 'who', 'father', 'be', 'gangster', 'boss', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'ex', 'cop', 'who', 'was', 'framed', 'jailed', '5', 'years', 'nothing', 'more', 'crush', 'responsible', 'aid', 'pint', 'sized', 'potty', 'mouthed', 'daughter', 'Mindy', 'A.K.A', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'played', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'who', 'absolutely', 'film', 'Moretz', 'incredible', 'chops', 'here', 'not', 'only', 'actress', 'stunt', 'person', 'almost', 'own', 'stunts', 'performance', 'amazing', 'know', 'see', 'kid', 'character', 'child', 'exploitation', 'really', 'child', 'different', 'are', 'more', 'mature', 'others', 'parents', 'responsibility', 'not', 'mine', 'see', 'can', 'handle', 'such', 'role.While', 'film', 'extremely', 'violent', 'portrayed', 'much', 'many', 'comic', 'books', 'today', 'lot', 'more', 'disturbing', 'film', 'know', 'lot', 'adults', 'read', 'comics', 'comics', 'are', 'made', 'kids', 'least', 'was', 'original', 'intent', 'comic', 'books', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'graphic', 'violence', 'maybe', 'should', 'be', 'age', 'restrictions', 'too', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'actual', 'Ass', 'comic', 'book', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'respond', 'how', 'closely', 'movie', 'comic', 'can', 'tell', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'ever', 'made.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'combo', 'pack', 'slick', 'looking', 'transfer', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'features', 'fans', 'hope', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'DVD', 'combo', 'trend', 'really', 'having', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'DVD', 'have', ""n't"", 'fully', 'committed', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'nice', 'have', 'formats', 'case', 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'someone', 'home', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'Blu', 'Ray.In', 'Short', 'Kick-Ass', 'just', 'around']",N/A

Aaron Johnson stars as Dave, a teenage loser whose obsession with comic books leads him to donning a ridiculous costume, calling himself Kick-Ass, and fighting crime.  Things don't go so well for him naturally in the process as he winds up getting his you know what handed to him, and eventually comes across masked vigilantes Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) who are targeting gangster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) whose own son (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse) decides to don a costume and call himself Red Mist.  Directed by Layer Cake helmer Matthew Vaughn (who at one time was set to helm the third X-Men film, and is no preparing an X-Men prequel), Kick-Ass is filled with fun, ridiculous violence and action, but sadly manages to lose steam after its first half.  The cast is great (Cage in particular has great fun doing an Adam West impersonation) all around, but even they can't save the fact that by the time Kick-Ass wraps up, it's become the kind of comic film that it pokes fun at in the first place.  Not to mention the fact that so much of the little things that made the comic and its characters so interesting (namely the real ""secret"" origin of Big Daddy and Hit Girl in the comic) is nowhere to be found, as are most of the darkly comedic moments and are replaced by more or less happier turnouts.  Despite how much the film adaptation of Kick-Ass has been streamlined from the comic though, the film is still plenty fun and enjoyable, and the fact that it didn't undergo a complete overhaul like the film adaptation of Wanted is reason enough to praise it alone.",4,"Not as good as the comic, but enjoyable nonetheless",1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,1740,"['Much', 'better', 'last', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'comic', 'film', 'adaptation', 'namely', 'Wanted', 'Kick-Ass', 'gleefully', 'ultraviolent', 'blast', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'Dave', 'teenage', 'loser', 'obsession', 'comic', 'books', 'donning', 'ridiculous', 'costume', 'calling', 'Kick-Ass', 'fighting', 'crime', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'so', 'well', 'naturally', 'process', 'up', 'getting', 'know', 'what', 'handed', 'eventually', 'masked', 'vigilantes', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'daughter', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'who', 'are', 'targeting', 'gangster', 'Frank', ""D'Amico"", 'Mark', 'Strong', 'own', 'son', 'Superbad', 'Christopher', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'don', 'costume', 'call', 'Red', 'Mist', 'Directed', 'Layer', 'Cake', 'helmer', 'Matthew', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'set', 'helm', 'third', 'X-Men', 'film', 'preparing', 'X-Men', 'prequel', 'Kick-Ass', 'filled', 'fun', 'ridiculous', 'violence', 'action', 'sadly', 'lose', 'steam', 'first', 'half', 'cast', 'great', 'Cage', 'particular', 'great', 'fun', 'doing', 'Adam', 'West', 'impersonation', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'fact', 'time', 'Kick-Ass', 'up', 'become', 'kind', 'comic', 'film', 'fun', 'first', 'place', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'so', 'much', 'little', 'things', 'made', 'comic', 'characters', 'so', 'interesting', 'namely', 'real', 'secret', 'origin', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Hit', 'Girl', 'comic', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'are', 'most', 'darkly', 'comedic', 'moments', 'are', 'replaced', 'more', 'less', 'happier', 'turnouts', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Kick-Ass', 'been', 'streamlined', 'comic', 'though', 'film', 'still', 'plenty', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'undergo', 'complete', 'overhaul', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Wanted', 'reason', 'enough', 'praise', 'alone']",N/A
1305926,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B002ZG983M,Newton Ooi,"[1, 1]","There are a lot of live action comic book movies out there.  Some, like Nolan's Batman movies are deadly serious epics about ethics, corruption, organized crime, etc...  Others, like the Spider-Man franchise with Tobey Maguire, and the Batman movies of Tim Burton, incorporate some humor via dialog and action.  Then there those like Iron Man where the main character itself provides the comedy by trying to be funny in the movie.  But never has there been an absolutely outrageous and hilarious comic-book movie like Kick-Ass.  From start to finish this movie is loaded with laughs of all sorts.  From slapstick action scenes to sarcastic dialog to ludicrous outfits, all accompanied by fast-paced music, this is the funniest comic book movie I have ever seen, and one of the funniest movies released in 2010.  But don't take your children to watch it.  This movie earned its ""R"" rating on many counts.  With bad language, some nudity, and a lot of bloody violence, this movie, which features more children than most movies, is certainly adults only.For those wanting to know what this movie resembles, I would answer ""Kill Bill"".  Both Kill Bill and Kick-Ass are titled after a male character in the movie, even though the principle character in both movies is female.  In the latter case, it is a pre-teenage girl.  In both Kill Bill and Kick-Ass, it is the female character that has the most action scenes, and the most kills.  And in both movies, most of the main characters have nicknames.  Other common threads are the excessive violence, large body count, gritty action, iconic musical score comprised of pop hits, and the theme of revenge flowing throughout.  Kick-Ass came in the same general time frame as other comedy movies about average people trying to become superheroes, movies such as Super and Defendor.

It' semi realistic because this is what would happen to you if you tried to just become a super hero one day; but, with some over the top, unique characters thrown in the movie.The story is well written, and it brings the comic book to life. I found it to be believable because you would have this stuff happen to you (at least some of it) if you put on a costume and decided to go ""fight"" crime. This is a comedy movie, so unrealistic parts are not as noticeable. The action is over the top, and there is a ton of it as well.The acting in this movie is well done. With the wide variety of colorful characters being portrayed in this movie, good acting helps with bringing those characters alive. The choreography the actors have between each other is professionally done, and you can tell they had to practice those moves out.The location this movie takes place in is a city, which I believe is New York. The streets look realistic, with degradation and detail for all them. The vehicles are pretty cool in this movie. Especially the tuned up Mustang since this is my favorite car.

Some review even said this took the violence a notch higher than Kill Bill. Really? What nonsense.This movie is just awesome. I haven't read the comic book but the script, casting, acting, editing and cinematography are just brilliant. Not to forget, the selection of music is really creative. Speaking of creative, the direction is inspired and this helps the movie flow from beginning to end, scene by scene. I didn't even feel the romantic side-show was bad. What's a superhero without a love interest, right?Anyway, if you were turned off from seeing this because of the reports of violence, give it a try. If you've seen any war film/fantasy film/historical war film/alien film this won't bother you. The action is choreographed very well and I nearly cried with joy when I saw the night vision First-Person-Shooter segment complete with the reloading animations and the ""Commando"" perk (FPS fans will probably get the reference). And the Good, the Bad and the Ugly soundtrack during the final act.And when***spoiler alert***Big Daddy is issuing tactical commands to Hit-Girl while being burned alive.***spoiler alert***It's little touches like this that make the movie better than any superhero movie I've ever seen.Anyway, the little girl really does deserve all the plaudits coming her way.

Having read all the great early buzz for Kick-Ass I entered with the concern that this would be the case here. Those high expectations though turned out to be far exceeded. Kick-Ass is a fantastic blend of a comic book vibe with heavy action and explicit violence,  plenty of laughs, and genuine emotional pull.Kick-Ass, based on the Mark Miller comic book series, focuses on a teenager who wants to make a difference by becoming a superhero. This is the real world though, he has no training and there are no super powers involved. Aaron Johnson takes on the role of Dave aka ""Kick-Ass"" who gets into crime fighting. He discovers there are more people out there like him but he is in way over his head.Nicolas Cage is the biggest name involved in the film and he is terrific as ""Big Daddy"" both in how he delivers his lines and in his relationship with his daughter ""Hit-Girl"" played by Chloe Moretz. I really enjoyed her in one of my favorite movies from last year 500 Days of Summer but she is even better here in a much more significant role. Their back story and motivations drive much of the events of the film. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays ""Red Mist"" the son of a mob boss and Clark Duke appears in a subdued secondary role as a friend of Dave.Early on in Kick-Ass I was actually feeling a little concerned. It began in a juvenile-like comedic direction in setting up the character as he decided to become ""Kick-Ass"". Had it continued down that road it probably would have been enjoyable but nothing special. However it didn't take long until it really took off and I was hooked the rest of the way. The movie was able to remain funny while at the same time adding a gravity that captivated the audience.Much has been made of the extremely violent and very graphic nature of the film. Despite knowing this going in I was actually caught off guard on numerous occasions. Even after the first few instances it kept getting me and based on the crowd reaction it seemed to be the case for everyone. There was often a unique mix of laughter and surprised response at what had actually happened on screen.Throughout there is a very unpredictable nature which is incredibly refreshing. I enjoyed the absence of the usual cliches and in many cases events occured that I immediately noted as things that just don't happen in other movies. It accomplished a very real feel which fit perfectly with the general theme of the film.One of the scenes that culminates in an action sequence in the final third of the movie may be my favorite ever. I tried to temper my reaction to it but it was incredible and given my affection for action movies that will tell you the regard in which I'm holding this. The scene was extremely intense, creative, very well directed and edited. There was a great deal of emotion involved given the situation at the time that I was literally on the edge of my seat. The music during the scene fit perfectly and really added to the tense nature of what was happening. The score throughout film really stood out to me as exceptional.I felt a strong connection to the main character and his desire to do something more with his life. Who hasn't wanted to be a hero in some form or fashion? This emotional attachment to not just the characters but their plights was totally unexpected. In addition to that there was the distinct realization that these were all vulnerable people and that anything could happen at any time. The movie was actually really powerful and had that emotional edge that I had no idea would be present.Rarely would I push anyone to see a movie but with Kick-Ass I've actively campaigned for it. See it! It is gruesome, action packed, funny and powerful.",5,"One of, if not my favorite, movie ever!",1325462400,"01 2, 2012",2012,3821,"['most', 'movie', 'fan', 'can', 'attest', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'high', 'levels', 'anticipation', 'can', 'lead', 'eventual', 'disappointment', 'Having', 'read', 'great', 'early', 'buzz', 'Kick-Ass', 'entered', 'concern', 'would', 'be', 'case', 'here', 'high', 'expectations', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'exceeded', 'Kick-Ass', 'fantastic', 'blend', 'comic', 'book', 'vibe', 'heavy', 'action', 'explicit', 'violence', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'genuine', 'emotional', 'pull.Kick-Ass', 'based', 'Mark', 'Miller', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'teenager', 'who', 'make', 'difference', 'becoming', 'superhero', 'real', 'world', 'training', 'are', 'super', 'powers', 'involved', 'Aaron', 'Johnson', 'role', 'Dave', 'aka', 'Kick-Ass', 'who', 'crime', 'fighting', 'are', 'more', 'people', 'there', 'way', 'head.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'biggest', 'name', 'involved', 'film', 'terrific', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'how', 'lines', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'Hit-Girl', 'played', 'Chloe', 'Moretz', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'last', 'year', '500', 'Days', 'Summer', 'even', 'better', 'here', 'much', 'more', 'significant', 'role', 'back', 'story', 'motivations', 'drive', 'much', 'events', 'film', 'Mintz-Plasse', 'Red', 'Mist', 'son', 'mob', 'boss', 'Clark', 'Duke', 'subdued', 'secondary', 'role', 'friend', 'Dave.Early', 'Kick-Ass', 'was', 'actually', 'feeling', 'little', 'concerned', 'began', 'juvenile-like', 'comedic', 'direction', 'setting', 'up', 'character', 'decided', 'become', 'Kick-Ass', 'Had', 'continued', 'down', 'road', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'enjoyable', 'nothing', 'special', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'really', 'took', 'off', 'was', 'hooked', 'rest', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'able', 'remain', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'adding', 'gravity', 'captivated', 'audience.Much', 'been', 'made', 'extremely', 'violent', 'very', 'graphic', 'nature', 'film', 'knowing', 'going', 'was', 'actually', 'caught', 'off', 'guard', 'numerous', 'occasions', 'Even', 'first', 'few', 'instances', 'kept', 'getting', 'based', 'crowd', 'reaction', 'seemed', 'be', 'case', 'everyone', 'was', 'often', 'unique', 'mix', 'laughter', 'surprised', 'response', 'what', 'had', 'actually', 'happened', 'screen.Throughout', 'very', 'unpredictable', 'nature', 'incredibly', 'refreshing', 'enjoyed', 'absence', 'usual', 'cliches', 'many', 'cases', 'events', 'occured', 'immediately', 'noted', 'things', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'happen', 'other', 'movies', 'accomplished', 'very', 'real', 'feel', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'general', 'theme', 'film.One', 'scenes', 'action', 'sequence', 'final', 'third', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'favorite', 'ever', 'tried', 'temper', 'reaction', 'was', 'incredible', 'given', 'affection', 'action', 'movies', 'will', 'tell', 'regard', ""'m"", 'holding', 'scene', 'was', 'extremely', 'intense', 'creative', 'very', 'well', 'directed', 'edited', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'emotion', 'involved', 'given', 'situation', 'time', 'was', 'literally', 'edge', 'seat', 'music', 'scene', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'really', 'added', 'tense', 'nature', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'score', 'film', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'exceptional.I', 'felt', 'strong', 'connection', 'main', 'character', 'desire', 'do', 'something', 'more', 'life', 'Who', ""n't"", 'wanted', 'be', 'hero', 'form', 'fashion', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'not', 'just', 'characters', 'plights', 'was', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'addition', 'was', 'distinct', 'realization', 'were', 'vulnerable', 'people', 'anything', 'could', 'happen', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'really', 'powerful', 'had', 'emotional', 'edge', 'had', 'idea', 'would', 'be', 'present.Rarely', 'would', 'push', 'anyone', 'see', 'movie', 'Kick-Ass', ""'ve"", 'actively', 'campaigned', 'See', 'gruesome', 'action', 'packed', 'funny', 'powerful']",N/A

1305944,A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ,B002ZG983M,Private Quentin Tarantino Fan,"[8, 11]","If you initially thought (thanks to the trailers having to be approved for all audiences) that Kick-ass would be a potential Razzie-award winning spoof on the same level as Disaster Movie, Dance Flick, Meet the Spartans, and just about every *insert type of movie here* movie that is released nowdays (one word for those cinematic _____mongers: UGH), don't feel bad if you did.  I did too.  When I first saw the trailer for Kick-ass, my mind went along the lines of ""why does the movie industry keep making these spoof movies!"".  I really did think the movie would be another lame spoof movie or a half-@$$ed superhero comedy for children.Instead, what I got was a endlessly entertaining (the movie took no time to ramp up), violent, foul-mouthed comic joyride, both making fun of comic books and at the same time being a serious superhero movie (albeit with a zany Red Bull bend). I admit that it took me the R-Rating and an uncensored preview when realizing what it really was: A violent, often hilarious, and almost Tarantino-ish superhero flick, both serious, funny, and gloriously over the-top.  So much for first impressions.  It's much more than that, and It's certainly the movie I've been waiting for this year, considering how dire the year of 2010 has been for films (the new Scorsese movie was a two and a half hour rejected Twilight Zone episode, at best).A comparison that is already swirling around is a mixture of Spider-man and Kill Bill, and as my namesake probably suggests, it appeared to my Tarantino senses and delivered some thrilling action sequences.  The action is stylized in a way that would make the man himself very proud.  Most funny are the riffs on comic books, such as Dave's first attack that surely shows him why many people don't don costumes in the first place.  However, if you are a fan of superhero films, comic books, and take them seriously, don't worry, Kick-Ass doesn't spit on your past time, either.  Despite some of the satirical jokes regarding comic books in general, Kick-Ass is still a genuine superhero film at heart.  Kick-ass doesn't turn into a cynical satire with a ""Superheroes are totally fake and your an idiot for getting into them"" message.  The superheros are also internally motivated (Big Daddy and Hitgirl are both victims of murder), which helps the film seem more like a real superhero film, than just a satire on the world of comics.I'm sure Kick-Ass might get some criticism as being a movie that has nothing to offer besides shock-value.  As far as shock value goes, I wouldn't quite go for that, especially if you've seen such movies as Cannibal Holocaust, but this movie doesn't need shock value (ask Tom Green).  You'll laugh when it's funny, and be energized by the violence of the movie, not shocked by it.  That's the reason why it's great, it's more than just shock value, it's pure fun, like the rollercoaster type of feeling.  When we ride rollercoasters, we don't think of the negative emotions and how tough we will look, we think of how much pure fun were having.  That's how the R worthy content in this movie should be approached.Some of the humor falls flat, as I found some (SOME, people) of the raunchy humor to be kind of hackneyed, such as the scene in the beginning regarding self-stimulation.  It wasn't like Superbad, where most of the raunchy jokes were laugh out loud hilarious and quite creative, at least in my opinion.  They were thought out, not their for some cheap laughs.  Thankfully, these kind of jokes are kept to a minimum with great use of timing and swearing in the dialogue.  As you probably have heard by now, the 11 year old (at the time) Chloe Moertz steals the show here, as the violent 11 year old teenage girl with the mouth of a sailor and the maturity of a person much older than her age.  Another funny performance, well performances, I found were the mobsters, as their foul-mouthed, deliberately crude dialogue got a lot of laughs from me.  Lot's of the situations are funny as well, as I found the scene where they put the man in the trash compactor to be darkly hilarious.I for one am not a great fan of Superhero movies (some people really love them and get into the backstories and characters much more than I do.  They really do treat them like Greek Mythology), but I do enjoy them and I must say that Kick-Ass is one of the most enjoyable superhero films I've seen, much more than movies like X-men or Superman Returns (though I list those for personal preferences, I have nothing wrong with those movies).  You'll get your money worth, and you'll have a Kick-ass time (sorry).  This movie is sure to become a cult classic someday, and like most cult movies, it will hit home for the right kind of viewer.  Either way, don't miss Kick-Ass.",4,The Most Fun You'll Have at the Movies This Year,1271376000,"04 16, 2010",2010,4766,"['initially', 'thought', 'thanks', 'trailers', 'having', 'be', 'approved',

This was a movie where the trailer was better then the movie.The movie follows a young outcast high school boy, as he decides to change his life, by becoming a Super Hero, complete with outfit and all.  However, his first confrontation doesn't turn out so well, when he is stabbed and beaten to a pulp.  Though that doesn't seem to deter him from trying again, after he mends up from getting out of hospital, which is when he meets Hit Girl and Big Daddy, the real take-no- prisoners-crime-fighters of the movie.  And Hit Girl, is awesome!  But it doesn't take long for the bad guys to find the newest Super Hero, and mistake him for the one damaging their business, when it was really Big Daddy and Hit Girl.  So the battles ensue, with a final blow out battle and somewhat happy ending.It was a great idea for a story, though I felt the movie fell short on delivering the story to screen.  I did like think the idea for the story was unique, as was the inclusion of the comic book story as a way of depicting the story.  It has some fantastic action sequences in it for sure!Though, it wasn't as funny as it could have been, in my opinion, or as witty.  Nor did I find the characters as compelling, as I wanted or hoped for them to be, which leads me to believe that the writing was a little lacking in character development, as well as story.I'm fine going to a horror movie and having some gore.  However, this movie, had way too much for my tastes.  And I don't believe it really needed the gore in it, to make the point or be visually entertaining/interesting.If you're looking for action and gore, with some humor, this might be just the ticket.

This is a riotous, hyper-violent movie where the bad guys don't just lose, they get their butts kicked.  The characters are lame but then again that is the point.The downside is that the characters are two-dimensional and almost lame they are so pure and righteous. The acting is dreadful and the script is just so lame that the good story telling is dragged down by the need to drop an F-Bomb every other word.  I mean that this script seems to be written by 14 year old boys who think it is cool to swear. While that drags down the script, the performances do rescue it.All in all this is a fun movie.

1305956,A1WD8PRZ5VQCS0,B002ZG983M,Reacher Creature,"[14, 19]","What a great time at the movie!  This has it all, it's funny, has great lines, decent plot and fantastic characters.The Plot is that an average high school wonders why nobody stands up for anyone being hurt or abused.  He doesn't have any super powers, and feels that it's not really needed to fight crime, and he's right.  As it turns out there are to others who feel the same way he does: Big Daddy and Hit Girl.  Also Red Mist.  I don't want to say why or how they join forces because I don't want to spoil anything.The characters are fantastic. I liked how we get into Kick Asses mind at one point he feels he should give up his alter ego, because it's a waste of time, and it's not fun any more.  Kick Ass was a decent character to have, but he wasn't the only one.Big Daddy, was a very interesting character. When you see Big Daddy, pay attention to his speech pattern. It's exactly like Adam West Did for Batman. That was such a nice touch. I also like the how Cage played his character, and then how he changed that character for Big Daddy.  It was a very nice job.Hit Girl, my favorite!!  She stole the movie and did it with a smile on her face.  By far, she was the best. She had the best lines, and the best actions scenes. When I say she can clean house, trust me on it.  This was a fantastic character.  She had the most violent scenes, and had a potty mouth, but for me, that's what added to the humor of it.  Hit Girl was fantastic, and I hope she has her own movie!  Hit Girl rocks!Overall, I really liked the movie and had a fun time with it.  It held my attention for the 2 hours, and didn't check my watch once.  It has a lot of action, great music/songs in it and some of the best editing I've seen in a while. It was also wonderfully written and acted.  This is what a movie should be. Now, this was a violent one. Don't be fooled into thinking it's for kids, cuz it's not. Lot of violence and some pretty naughty language, and I mean naaaaaaughty.This is a fantastic popcorn movie. If you go, I'm sure you'll like it as much as I did.

1305957,A39W3263A9HCMN,B002ZG983M,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[6, 8]","I gotta say that going to see Kick-Ass last night was one of the most surprising moviegoing experiences in a long time. The trailer made it look like your typical action comedy. That said the trailers still piqued my interest. When I went to go see it, I was totally unprepared for the dark, disturbing and violent, yet extremely hilarious ride that is Kick-Ass. So as you may see, the trailers were totally misleading... in a good way. It is a bit of a shame that this was a rather underwhelming box office result; but maybe it`ll boost next weekend due to all the good word of mouth.Kick-Ass is NOT your typical action comedy. It is NOT this year's Pineapple Express or Inglourious Basterds. Kick-Ass is a dark, twisted, violent and and brutal fun ride through a wannabe superhero, his love interest, a superhero who's dad is part of the Mob, a superhero daddy and his daughter, and a twisted plot involving the mob. It is also totally hilarious and has the usual teen movie formula with the love interest and the protagonist's geeky friends. Those mixed together form quite possibly the best movie I've seen this year!Dave is a geeky, young, teen boy. He has two geeky best friends he hangs with and is totally invisible to the girls. He always has wondered what it is like to be a superhero. But moreso, the question becomes: what is a superhero without superpowers? Batman doesn't have superpowers. One day, he finds a superhero costume online and orders it, and with it soon becomes the first actual superhero: Kick-Ass. One day after getting stabbed by a hoodlum, he gets tons of metal plates installed and now he has the chops to be a superhero!Meanwhile, Mindy (performed wonderfully by Chloe Meritz) and her daddy Damon (played by Nicolas Cage) live together and live in danger. He teaches Mindy to grow up early if the time comes where he dies and she has nobody to go to. However, they become superheroes themselves when hearing of Kick-Ass's fighting with gang members in a parking lot. As for the kid who's dad is in the mob, Chris? He becomes one too, Red Mist. But when the mob believe that Kick-Ass is killing all their members off, a war wages between the bunch and the mob, strapping the audience to their seats for one brutal and hilarious ride!As mentioned, Kick-Ass is just that: KICK-ASS!!!!! A stellar cast is combined with a great script and tons of brutal violence. Aaron Johnson does a great job as Dav, and does a great job at hiding his British accent. Nic Cage, someone I usually do not like is hilarious as well, his Adam West mannerisms are pure epic win in every sense. But the show stealer: Chloe Meritz!!!! She turns in a performance as tough-as-nails 12 year old Hit Girl. As for the violence, it's definitely not for the squeamish. There's a load of gore, and when the gory bits come you'll be shocked for sure. The torture scene is probably one of the most disturbing scenes I've seen in a long time too. Also you may find it shocking that a 12 year old is doing most of the killing!This movie is definitely not for kids under 15. It is indeed very violent and disturbing and they will probably find it disturbing too. But aside from that, this is an excellent movie that is a must-see this year! You'll NOT regret it.",5,"Too dark, too brutal, too disturbing... yet totally hilarious!

tailored costume of his own,and he will assume the name of Red Mist.That way he can befriend Kick Ass and deliver him right to his dad.The plan goes better than expected when Red Mist gets Kick Ass asks to meet with Big Daddy and Hit Girl.When Red Mist enters the room he shoots Hit Girl who falls right out the window.Kick Ass and Big Daddy are taken hostage and paraded on camera,on line,before countless viewers,who will witness their execution.Both are beaten badly and just as the two are to be set on fire Hit Girl enters the scene and starts a one by one campaign of kick-assery.She rescues both,but her father succumbs to burns he suffered.Back home Hit Girl is out for revenge.She and Kick-Ass take the fight directly to D'Amico's office tower and floor.Hit girl is a virtual dynamo and mows down all who oppose her,until one of D'Amico's henchman brings out a bazooka.Just as it looks like she's headed for heavens gate,Kick-Ass appears outside in a hover suit,loaded with two machine guns.He does some housing cleaning and saves Hit Girl.They finally get into D'Amico's office and while Kick-Ass fights Red Mist,Hit Girl takes on the don himself.Kick-Ass ad Red Mist fight to a draw,while Hit Girl is down and out and just about to receive the coup de' gras.Kick-Ass enters with the bazooka originally intended for Hit Girl and blasts D'Amico out the glass window.The film ends as Hit Girl has enrolled at Kick-Ass's school and we listen as D'Amico's son plans revenge.This movie has multiple in jokes with past movies and its' soundtrack at times is very clever.For example,when we first see Hit Girl's fighting abilities the theme song to the old cartoon the Banana Peels,is playing in the background.As I said this film has a ton of heart and the girl's hutzpah,moves and,dare I say,language,are something to behold.She may be around 11,but she is more like 31 in attitude.Cage plays her loving father and at no time do we not know that.Although I should qualify that by saying when we first see the pair together,it is Cage firing rounds into his daughters chest at close range,so she can get the feel of what a bullet impact feels like.It tends to make you scratch your head and say,""wtf?"",but soon all is revealed.Oh,and she does wear a Kevlar vest at all times(dad taught her well!).Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary,and featurettes on its making and art and the trailer.All in all a VERY pleasant and surprising diversion of a film(I love it when that happens).It is a nice twist and mix of different genres and has great heart.I highly recommend Kick-Ass.And kids....don't try this at home!",4,Another somebody done somebody wrong song...er movie!4-4 1/2

It had a lot of action and humorous parts. The acting was also great and it had an interesting storyline. Now all of those people out there who are saying that this was such a horrible movie and that it's not a family movie and such. Well, I just have to say a couple things. First, it is rated R. Right there should be enough for most parents to not let their children watch this movie. Second, if you let your kids watch some R rated movies based on their content, you can look right on the back of the dvd case or on the internet and it tells you right there why it's rated R. And I believe it says on the back of this case that this movie is rated R because it has brutal violence throughout, pervasive language, sexual content, nudity, and drug use - some involving children. As I have said, that is as it says exactly on the back of this movie's case. Right there should send up a red flag that this movie is not for kids. If you let your kids watch movies without even knowing why they are rated what they are, then you are just asking for your children to see things that they are not ready to see or hear stuff you don't want them to. So don't blame the movie, blame yourself.Over all, this was a very good movie - for adults.

1305983,AIVW1JAT9T44,B002ZG983M,"Rustin Parr ""Rustin Parr""","[6, 8]","Uma Thurman's The Bride would certainly show ""Kick Ass"" to her daughter, in time to prepare both themselves for Tarantino's Volume Three. ""Kick Ass"" is a bloody, violent action extravaganza that is smart enough to find its own footing, without being bogged down by censorship, and audience expectations. The highlight of the film is Hit Girl, who singlehandedly steals the spotlight from all her adult counterparts, including Kick Ass himself. This element of deconstruction, about how an 11-year-old girl could kill, maim, often bloody, with abandonment, and even with relish, is effective, for the most part. However, one of the main reasons why the film did not sit well with other people is in regards to the ethical implications of the character of Hit Girl, whom all fantasies, both carnal and violent, I'm sure, have been projected onto her on the big screen. However, though the deconstruction of the representation of superheroes and also our myriad of expectations coming from the typical way they are drawn is merely effective for the most part in this film, the lack of dramatic and emotional substantiality is what weakens the film, in regards to where it stands on ethics and morality. It does not matter if there is a lack of ethics and morality in the film, it is after all, a deconstruction, a satire, an overturning of the comic book and super hero genre. However, it seems to gloss it over at the end. Yes, this is a film about superheroes, but it does not mean that it could just skim over the emotional and dramatic nature; even flawed superheroes are just as humans as the viewers who root for them. Hit Girl appears to be merely shaken, not traumatized by the end. Sure, she has been efficiently trained to be like that; however, she is still a child.

Secondly, it's really and truly not.I have never in my life witnessed a film that so successfully blended laugh-out-loud comedy with heavy, intensely graphic action and dire drama, and Kick Ass will often switch amongst all three in a single scene.  It's wise to bring tissues to the theater for when the coke splurts out of your nose from intense laughter, but you may need it for wiping away a tear, as well.  And it will definitely come in hand when the guy behind you jumps up and screams ""F--- YEAH!"" while accidentally knocking his cup onto your lap.  Kick Ass is likely to provide all three experiences, and it is truly and unexpectedly a cinematic triumph as a result.At the heart of this mixing of genres is Nicholas Cage's character, ""Big Daddy,"" who effortlessly alternates amongst surreal and unbalanced father of the year, dead-on Adam West impersonator, and poignant tragic hero without blinking an eye.  I've never liked Nicholas Cage prior to seeing this film (even I'm not sure why), but I just became his biggest fan after watching this.  The rest of the cast does stellar work as well, but this film couldn't have soared the way it does without Cage's presence.Beyond that, the camera work, editing, and soundtrack all do an incredible job of keeping you glued to the screen throughout.  If you're coming to this film looking for yet another easily assembled (and easily forgotten) spoof film of the season, you're likely to find yourself barking up the wrong tree.  I'm going to smack myself for saying something this cliche, but, for lack of better terminology, Kick Ass kicks ass.One obligatory warning in this otherwise glowing review: Kick Ass is not for everyone.  If you have a problem with graphic violence, particularly when it involves children, stay far away from this film.  Hit Girl, who appears to be 10 or 11 years old, is far from your standard side-kick who watches safely from the sidelines.  In fact, most of the graphic violence and death depicted in this film are thanks to her character.  Yes, there is a message in this film that the way she has been raised was neither healthy nor appropriate, but it's likely to get lost in the cheers and laughs that are elicited by her many exploits.  In general, the major issue that seems to separate these characters from their fictional heroes, even more than their naivety, is the fact that they see no problem with killing criminals.  Don't expect a heavy-handed Batman moral about not stooping to bad guys' level, either.

1306002,A14Q5D3QYA8FPV,B002ZG983M,Shopper,"[116, 136]","The film is based on a comic book by the same name. The rights to the story were sold before the book was even published (it debuted only eight weeks before the film):A teenage boy decides to take a stand for justice. He dons a green scuba costume and names himself Kick-Ass. However, not having any actual superpowers, this hero's good intentions quickly land him in an ICU. Eventually though, Kick-Ass crosses paths with a couple of far more effective (a.k.a. deadly) heroes: Big Daddy, a former cop falsely convicted of drug trafficking, and Hit-Girl, his eleven year old daughter. Big Daddy has spent the past six years training his little girl in all forms of mortal combat, hoping she would help him revenge her mother's death and her father's fall from grace, orchestrated by a local Mafia Boss.  Enter blood, gore, and plenty of belly laughs...Let me get straight to the point: yes, the film was funny and highly entertaining. However, initially I felt uneasy laughing at an eleven year old girl determinedly slaughtering a roomful of men, even if they were rotten to the core and disserving of every bullet and of every knife wound. But then, I remembered what I was like at that age: it was the early 80's. My favourite toys were a silver colt revolver and a sword. Depending on my mood, I would pretend to be a cowboy taking on a bunch of wild Indians, or a Jedi disarming (literally) Darth Vader and his evil cohorts. So, if any of you want to believe that little girls' minds are all about sugar and spice, well... good luck with that (by the way, I managed to grow into adulthood WITHOUT slipping into drugs and/or alcohol, and no, I was not a teenage mother). And so, that quick recollection gave me the permission to look at the film as an absurd exercise in fantasy and allowed me to enjoy every minute of it. Yes, the film was well written, directed and edited, but the special mention must go to the actress who portrayed Hit-Girl. Chloe Moretz was indeed eleven at the time of filming, but had the presence of a seasoned performer. I am looking forward to watching her future projects.  There is already talk of a sequel.

1306004,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B002ZG983M,Sky,"[3, 4]","I don't get out to the theater much, so when I saw the positive reviews for the film adaptation of Kick Ass back in April of 2010 I decided to give thegraphic novela try. First of all, it was a fun, very quick read, because it was heavy on the ""graphic"" and light on the ""novel"". Lot's of well-drawn, ""graphic"", colorful images with blood spurting everywhere (as well as other bodily fluids).Now it's very rare that I say what I am about to say and many of the book's fans, Mark Millar fans and just plain old folks that disagree will call me blasphemous, but....The movie adaptation of Kick Ass is better than the comic book; um, I mean book; er, I mean graphic novel. Oh sure, the movie takes some liberties over what was originally drawn out in print. In my opinion a good movie adaptation of a book needs only to be as good as or better than the original author's ideas, and Director Matthew Vaughn pulled this off flawlessly.Don't get me wrong; the original story is mostly intact. Vaughn just takes the over the top, crazy-violent, captivating story of a teenager that dares to live out his dream of being a superhero to a new level in the film version. The story is very well written and flows superbly. Meet Dave Lizewski whose favorite pass-time is, you guessed it, comic books. Specifically, comic books with superheroes. And this kid's fantasy is, you guessed it, to be a superhero. So what do you think he does? (Okay, I'll stop saying ""you guessed it"" now.) He puts on a costume, calls himself Kick Ass, and he goes out looking for trouble. And he finds it.He also finds out that he's not alone in his fantasy world of kids gone superhero. Enter Hit Girl played by Chloe Moretz. Moretz's performance is a big part of what took Kick Ass from a 4-Star movie to a 5-Star movie for me. Moretz is no wimpy kid, and the girl she is inDiary of a Wimpy Kidis nowhere to be found in Kick Ass. She slices, dices and she does it with a smile. Okay, yes, it sounds morbidly disturbed to praise an 11 year old for chopping up bad guys with such a seemingly pleasurable disposition. But, man, that one scene where she chops, then looks over at Kick Ass with that little girl, new front teeth smile as if to say, ""check me out, wasn't that cool,"" only to repeat the same action a few more times unflappably just won me over.And the rest of the cast turn in A-List performances as well. Not just Aaron Johnson who plays Lizewski/Kick Ass, but the whole doggone cast...including Nicolas Cage as Big Daddy. Cage ain't noGhost Riderin this movie; he's a quirky, washed up cop that's out for revenge against a mobster who framed him in a former life, and Cage plays the role perfectly. While the character of Big Daddy is a bit different from the tough guy character in the book, it takes nothing from the story and I think that only a preservationist could disagree.Like I said earlier, the story is deliberately over the top and even pretty believable up until some of our heroes start to develop super strength in some situations...perhaps not super strength, but maybe super-resilient powers is a better way to put it. But the great acting, directing and flawless execution of every scene made up for any of the silliness that wasn't designed to be silly.This one goes on my shelf right next to some of my other favorite cult classic movies. If you're already a fan too and you haven't heard, there's a Kick Ass 2 planned for 2012, but I'd predict that topping the original will be about as successful as topping...well...you try to name a cult classic sequel that has ever outdone itself.

It definitely lived up to expectations. And as much as I love random, no-thinking-required comedies, this one actually had a few good messages, and when you add in a Sin-City-ish ton of blood and a badass eleven-year-old,  you've got  a little something something.Don't get me wrong, it's probably going to rub you the wrong way from the start. I mean it's totally warped. You've got a father shooting his kid in the chest so that she can get used to the feeling of being shot (although later on we learn that he used ""low-velocity"" bullets...awww). Said kid swears like a sailor and kills bad-guys like a tiny ninja without blinking an eye. She reminded me of the school girl in Kill Bill. So it's probably going to scrape against what's been ingrained into you as socially acceptable because it really isn't on many levels - little girls shouldn't be foul-mouthed killing machines for one. That aside, it was a pretty good flick, but you have to put yourself in the mindset of Kill Bill. It's going to be gory and off-putting but it's going to be cool in its own sick twisted way.So what's Kick-Ass about? Dave is an ordinary high-school boy, more of a nerd than anything, and he asks the question of why don't more people try to help others. Why aren't there more real-life superheroes? After being mugged and bullied, he buys a costume online and tries to defend people, calling himself Kick-Ass. The first time he gets completely  creamed (and stabbed) ending up in the hospital with all kinds of metal in his body and messed-up nerve endings. The second time he gets You-Tubed sticking up for a guy being beaten up by thugs, and suddenly Kick-Ass is an online superstar.In his adventures, he meets two other ""superheroes,"" Big Daddy and Hit Girl who have their own agenda - to take down the big-boss kingpin drug dealer who framed Big Daddy and killed his wife. Hit Girl is eleven and is Big Daddy's own mini-me killing machine (she asks for switch blades on her birthday...awesome!) Meanwhile the drug boss thinks that Kick-Ass is responsible for killing his men even though it's really Big Daddy, so the drug boss' son decides to dress up as a superhero (Red Mist) to lure in Kick-Ass and the other two.

It's incredibly violent for one and the idea that a little girl (the appropriately named ""Hit Girl"" and played by an astounding Chloe Grace Moretz) could be portrayed as a sadistic murderess who undoubtedly enjoys killing bad guys in horrific ways is enough to offend anyone who can't see past the idea that it's not to be taken seriously. Her father, Big Daddy (played by Nicolas Cage in his trademark strange delivery), is another beast altogether. This film is a great take on the normal people thrown into extraordinary circumstances theme and while I personally feel the film loses it's way a little bit near the end, it's still very entertaining and worth watching. Aaron Johnson really nails the role of Kick-Ass and does a great job of making you root for him while Christopher Mintz Plasse is great as Red Mist as well. I'd think twice before letting little kids see this, in case you thought this was family friendly fare.I would recommend this Blu Ray solely on the strength of the extensive making-of documentary included, which shows you in detail just about every facet of interest regarding the film's production. I was hooked once I started watching it and if you are interested in well made behind-the-scenes documentaries, I would gladly recommend this. It's long and exhaustive but really does a good job of showing what film productions are like and just how much of a risk on the part of the filmmakers was taken to bring this film to light.If you like the film and/or the comics, do yourself a favor and pick up this disc as they did justice to it.

1306019,A2YW1TL9ZR3URI,B002ZG983M,"The Mad Bostonian ""Steve""","[4, 6]","Kick Ass is how should I say.... awesome, hilarious, cool, high octane energy, kinetic, B*lls to the wall violent, edgy. Have not seen a movie this outlandish since Wanted (which Mark Millar also wrote the graphic novel) and Shoot 'Em Up, both spectacular.Director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake) gives us a movie that is unique in its own right, takes the mythos of comic book heroes and gives it a 360 twist, and creates a memorable movie.This movie will dazzle you, don't get me wrong it is violent, then again it's based on a graphic novel so it's suppose to be! Vaughn has gathered a great group of actors, veteran and new alike to tell a story of a teenager named Dave (new comer Aaron Johnson) who is tired of just sitting on the sidelines of life, tired of the injustice he sees around him, people being victimized and no one does nothing, so he goes out to create his alter ego, Kick Ass! Johnson plays Dave as a geeky, shy, bored, horny teenager, how we were in high school, what keeps it so real, he plays the uber geek to perfection, when it is so well done by the likes of Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg, Aaron Johnson takes it to another level creating something primo, where we as a viewer root for this guy! And Kick Ass doesn't screw around, he gets right into it--- shall I say the proverbial ""popping that first Vigilante cherry"", early on tries to stop some thugs who are stealing a car and ends up getting his ass handed to him, almost getting killed, much like what would happen in real life... yet this does not deter his quest and his next foray into fighting turns out better and his alter ego Kick Ass becomes famous setting off a chain of events that he could not even fathom would happen. Even when meeting Hit Girl and Big Daddy for the first time who save his butt, he then realizes that they are the real deal, fighting crime, kicking ass and taking names, and that the up close violence for him is just too much and it's not like the movies portray it to be, where he's just a kid, having pipe dreams of doing something extraordinary out of the ordinary. In the end though, doing the right thing even it means your life is the right thing to do.Special Kudos goes to Mark Strong (plays Frank D'Amico), this actor I am liking more and more ever since seeing him in Body of Lies and RocknRolla, and Sherlock Holmes, watch out for him in the new Robin Hood this summer with Russell Crowe! he plays the bad guy with such humor and yet also grounded as if he could be a real guy in real life, he is a drug king pin using a Lumber Co. as a front for his operations, a wonderful performance in deed, delivers great dead pan humor.Then there is Hit Girl/ Mindy MacCready (new comer Chloe Moretz), a 11 year old who can wield a knife, gun, grenades, swords with the best, and curses like a sailor, what makes it even that more funny! She is certainly a scene stealer in this movie, great job by this young talented actress. And there is Big Daddy/ Damon MacCready (played by my man Nic Cage, I forgive you Cage for giving us crap like Knowing, Next, Bangkok Dangerous, and Ghost Rider) Nic Cage gives such a nuanced performance, teaching his young daughter the art of shoot, kill, maim, and when he is in costume changing his voice (taking a page out of Adam West when he donned the bat suit), He did a great job with his role, his back story is he has some unfinished business with D'Amico, check out his off kilter, brilliant performance in Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans, awesome movie. Christopher Mintz Plasse (Red Mist/ Chris D'Amico) we all know him as McLovin--- shedding that persona giving us a more complex, more than meets the eye type character who just wants the attention of his father and show he can hang and be tough and wants so desperately to show he can take over his pop's business, and all too eager to help his dad get rid of Kick Ass.I am happy Vaughn and Co. made a hard R movie, not shying away from the violence, even though it shows young people in peril, no compromises, staying true to its comic book roots and being loyal. And almost lampooning Spiderman, Superman, XMen, Watchmen and yet ultimately honoring said comics. A nice homage to Watchmen which is the blue print for Vigilante Heroes which owes it's roots to the Batman mythology. The director takes what we always wanted to be; who hasn't said in their youth, ""Damn wish I could be Batman, Superman, Wolverine, Iron Man"". Where Vaughn took the tried and true comic books and movies incorporates everything we love but keeps it so real and tangible.A couple of great scenes stand out for me, one is D'Amico and his goons have captured Big Daddy and Kick Ass, they are being tortured, not a pleasant scene, pretty brutal... but what follows, the action sequence is just utterly mind blowing, a First Person Shooter scene was just so visually eye popping made Doom's FPS look childish!And the last 25 mins or so, the assault on D'Amico's high rise condo was dead on cool. And the soundtrack was amazing, using a Ennio Morricone type Spaghetti Western Style music was freakin' Frosty! The whole soundtrack just was in sync with the movie.Kick Ass is a no holds barred movie that leaves you satisfied, where after viewing you just wanna grab a smoke and think about what you just witnessed, I cannot wait for the sequel, and this most definitely will be added to my Blu Ray collection.",5,with no great powers comes no responsibility,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,5402,"['Kick',

Sure there were some exceptions but they didnt leave out any important detail whether it be Hit-Girl violant and gory attacks or sub plots. Nicholas Cage does a great job playing Big-Daddy. In interviews he based his acting method in the movie with Adam West who played Batman (there are similarities in look between the two) from the 70s tv show.Now dont expect this to be a teen action movie about a nerdy high schooler who becomes a super hero. Its rated R for a very good reason. I wont get into details but I would just saw some scenes arent for the faint of heart. So parents dont have your little kids watching this because it looks like a Spider-Man like movie.Now the only reason I didnt give this a perfect score is simple.

Vigilantism is the least.  What perhaps is the most stark is the turning of a little 10-year-old girl (Chloe Grace Moretz as Hit Girl) into a bitter and cold killing machine.  Ex-cop Nicholas Cage (who is not the star) turns himself into the Batman-esque Big Daddy, father of Hit Girl who trains his daughter by firing guns at her and letting her experience what it's like to be shot--she's padded with a bulletproof vest, after his wife is murdered by a gangster/ drug-lord of sorts.  These two characters, brutal and efficient, are the real anti-hero deals of this colorful twist on comic book superhero movies.  But our entrypoint into this world is the hapless and nerdy Kick-Ass who idolizes the superheros as much for their machismo as their heroism.  After he decides to put on a rather retarded costume he learns some valuable lessons by brute force but, as in any heroes journey, he overcomes by sheer force of will and by getting better and adapting.  Inevitably he comes across and aids Hit Girl (the other way around actually) and they form a partnership that eventually overthrows the baddies (including Red Mist, the son of the aforementioned gangster, played nebbishly and buffoonishly by Christopher Mintz-Plasse).The film is gleeful in its portrayal of mangling and bloody violence.  It is geared to shock sensibilities.  That it doesn't do so more says a lot about our culture than the film itself.  This film is enteratainment after all and while it isn't saying something necessarily profound (people feel powerless and want to stand up to jerks; the average joe craves to be more than he is; for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, even if delayed) that doesn't mean it doesn't have anything worth saying.

It's based on the comic by Mark Millar, although in my opinion it's better than the comic-- like most of Millar's recent work, the comic was extremely cynical and paints a very grim portrait of all the characters in it. The movie takes a more sincere approach-- one might argue that it's not as ""realistic,"" but hey, what's so realistic about a 10 year old girl in a superhero costume driving a meat cleaver through a criminal's head, anyway?

It's gritty, but at the same time it's got a great sense of humor and an odd sense of sincerity-- unlike the original comic, it ultimately sides with the notion that even though living as a superhero would take a serious toll on you and force you to do some rather questionable things, the superhero is still a noble ideal that can inspire people to be more than just another pebble in the road.",5,A superhero flick that perfectly contrasts between cynical and sincere.,1329609600,"02 19, 2012",2012,1153,"['Kick-Ass', 'not', 'typical', 'superhero', 'movie', 'question', 'were', 'bored', 'comic', 'fanboy', 'decided', 'become', 'superhero', 'how', 'far', 'would', 'take', 'based', 'comic', 'Mark', 'Millar', 'opinion', 'better', 'comic', 'most', 'Millar', 'recent', 'work', 'comic', 'was', 'extremely', 'cynical', 'very', 'grim', 'portrait', 'characters', 'movie', 'more', 'sincere', 'approach', 'one', 'might', 'argue', 'not', 'realistic', 'hey', 'what', 'so', 'realistic', '10', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'superhero', 'costume', 'driving', 'meat', 'cleaver', 'criminal', 'head', 'anyway', 'are', 'game', 'extremely', 'violent', 'film', 'costumed', 'vigilantes', 'powers', 'who', 'have', 'qualms', 'killing', 'bad', 'guys', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'gritty', 'same', 'time', 'got', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'odd', 'sense', 'sincerity', 'original', 'comic', 'ultimately', 'sides', 'notion', 'even', 'living', 'superhero', 'would', 'take', 'serious', 'toll', 'force', 'do', 'rather', 'questionable', 'things', 'superhero', 'still', 'noble', 'ideal', 'can', 'inspire', 'people', 'be', 'more', 'just', 'pebble', 'road']",N/A

It starts out with the main character (Kick-Ass) narrating. The audience sees a costumed hero leap from a tall building and...splat...lands on a taxi. The kid is a geek whose only super power seems to be that he is virtually invisible to the opposite sex. He gets it in his head that he should try to be a super hero. His disguise? A green wet suit. His first outing is not very successful, having been stabbed and then hit by a car. On the plus side he has metal reinfocements throughout his skeleton and deadened nerve ending. Meanwhile Big Daddy and Hit-Girl are disrupting a drug lord's operations (and humorous Batman jokes are plentiful). When the three meet, Hit-Girl shows that she more than lives up to her name, having been well tarined by her ""Big Daddy."" The movie has a simple, yet effective plot, delivers the action, the gun fights, the topical super hero references, a foul mouthed little girl, a dad who is out for revenge, and a comic nerd who eventually gets the girl of his dreams by the end of the film.

1306036,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B002ZG983M,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[6, 7]","Movie - 4.5Yet another film I never got around to watching in theaters, but still a piece of work that I ended up liking a lot, Kick-Ass really caught me by surprise with the mishmash of elements it possessed in both writing and production. Initially, the trailer for this movie had me thinking it would be more along the lines of a satire, which it kind of is, but it's also a representation of the superhero genre as well as a parody in and of itself (think Edgar Wright and his work with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz). While not any one aspect of the film overpowers the other, I think there are enough of them to cater to a multitude of audiences. Kick-Ass is the story of Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), an average teenager with average problems who likes to read comics, becomes a self-made, wannabe superhero, and within this life, comes to realize its hazards, while also trying to impress a girl at school (Lyndsy Fonseca). He meets two true superheroes in Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), and adventure ensues as they try to bring down big-time mobster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). For me personally, I found the main theme to be a coming-of-age story. Dave has a good heart and wants to do good things (and get laid), but ultimately isn't much of a superhero, later realizing he wasn't really cut out for the gig. His character is sympathetic and very relatable, in my opinion, and does a great job propelling the audience into all kinds of other aspects. In addition to Dave's self-discovery, the film also has various instances of dark and raunchy comedy, character drama, vengeance and redemption, and brutal, stylized violence, of which the last is probably the most controversial in the form of 11 year-old Moretz's depiction for her character. However, if anything else, this particular aspect of the film will probably wow most people over because it really is a great performance with enough of a message (if you want to interpret one), while also being escapist entertainment at its best. I just wish the movie were a little longer to flesh out the characters a bit more, but we'll see if they expand upon that in the sequel.Video - 4.0I swear I thought something was wrong with the transfer upon my initial viewing. Colors seem vibrant enough, but become way overblown at times, while black levels were inconsistent, crushed, and on occasion shades of blue. Contrast was affected as well by those fluctuating blacks and resulted in lost detail and smeared textures. But after watching the extras, I found out it was all intentional. You see, in the comics the ink artist was told that he wasn't to use the color black.. ever. Looking at some of the pictures from the comic, it certainly makes for a much more peculiar type of art style, but what looks good on paper doesn't always necessarily translate well to the film medium. While the grain thing may have worked for Zack Snyder and 300, colors, blacks, contrast, and sharpness still had an amazing amount of depth, detail, and delineation through his cinematography. But here, a lot of the uniqueness seems to work more against the picture than for it. The best examples I can use for comparison are the scenes where Big Daddy raids the lumber factory and the one where Hit Girl is trying to save him and Kick-Ass. In the raid scene, you get a really good look at his costume from a variety of angles. You think it'd be a black, Batman-type suit with a black shotgun in his hands, right? Well, neither of them are black, they're ""Off-Black."" Who's ever heard of the color ""Off-Black?"" Black is supposed to be black. But then in the rescue scene when the lights are shot out, the pitch black darkness is as black as the abyss of death (or whatever scary, black allusion you can think of). There were actual blacks within the cinematography here, and they were absolutely perfect. It's just a shame the rest of the film wasn't as clean. Kudos to DP, Ben Davis, and the color department for trying preserve the intended look and integrity of the comic, though.Audio - 5.0Sure the video is a bit questionable, but the audio has no issues, whatsoever. The DTS-HD 7.1 track is relatively underused in the presence of dialogue, which sounds perfect and un-muddled, by the way. But when action and ambiance occur, it's quite the technical nugget. Directionality consists of a mixed bag and presents itself mainly through the use of music and whatever sound effects are present on-screen. Things like cars, city noise, and crowd chatter do what's expected of them in terms of proper placement and panning, while the more aggressive sounds like hits, cuts, thuds, and gunshots have a tendency to disperse through any one of the other six surround channels when the moment calls for them. Musical accompaniment and songs from a wide variety of artists and the four composers who worked on this film do a splendid job adding pace and mood, particularly the John Williams Superman homage in Kick-Ass' theme and the Zimmer/Howard Joker theme used build tension at one point. Separation of said effects and music are spot-on, never letting the dialogue get lost. A few great reference scenes would be the aforementioned Big Daddy raid and Hit Girl rescue, or even the final scene where Hit Girl invades D'Amico's headquarters, as there's quite a bit of action and gunshot activity throughout each. LFEs aren't too frequent, but really make themselves known in the form of heavier rounds being fired and through the occasional explosion, burning flame, or bass rhythm. Don't be fooled by the majority of a front-heavy presentation at the beginning. Things will unfold as they should.Extras - 5.0Kick-Ass is loaded with special features. I literally spent 6 hours watching every single feature on the disc: the movie, the movie with P-i-P commentary (skipped the audio one since it's excerpted from the Bonus View Mode), and then the 2-hour making-of featurette (actually a little over 2 hours, if you combine it with the ""history of the comic"" feature). So this Bonus View thing is apparently Lionsgate's answer to Warner Brothers' Maximum Movie Mode. A window for the commentary takes up the screen with director Matthew Vaughn sitting there in a studio watching the movie (which plays on your screen in the bottom corner), while bits and pieces of behind-the-scenes footage is mixed in with his comments. It's damn informative in a lot of aspects from the pre-production, filming, and post-production phases down to the challenges faced in making the whole thing. Vaughn presents himself well and seems to be really proud of what he accomplished, given a lot of problems that occurred and the fact that they only had a $28 million dollar budget. It's a mix between business-oriented and kick-back commentary on the project and manages to be a very engaging experience. On the other hand, the making-of feature doesn't recycle a thing from the Bonus View Mode and is all fresh material. It essentially covers more of the overall production of the film from beginning to end in great detail and has various interviews, excerpts, and events to really show the viewer how much freakin' work they put into it. Then finally, there's a 20-minute feature talking about the comic, what Mark Millar wanted to do with it, how John Romita Jr. went about drawing it, and all that other stuff. It's truly an exhausting set of extras, but if you ever wanted to know anything about Kick-Ass in either movie or comic form, the Blu-ray is where you need to look.Overall - 4.5This movie was a big surprise for me. Most comic book adaptations to the big screen tend to have fairly linear narratives, an understood formula for storytelling, and plausible protagonists. Kick-Ass is kind of a warped version of these elements, though oddly enough still manages to tell the same kind of story.

I thought this movie ruled on many levels, all having  to do with Hit Girl, Big Daddy, and the quality of the fillmaking itself.  This movie is incredibly violent - some people say the violence is supposed to be satirical, but I don't buy that.  Kick Ass the character is a lame-o faux superhero created by a dork high school kid who is fed up with innocent people getting screwed over by bad men.  He gets in over his head though and almost gets killed by thugs before his life is saved by Hit Girl and Big Daddy - a father daughter team of actual crime fighters who are attempting to bring down the city's boss of crime through the use of hard core no mercy violence.  Honestly Kick Ass is the weakest character in the film by a large margin.  He's a whiner, he's weak, he's stupid (gets easily duped by an obvious phony - the Red Mist); he's basically an idiot.  When he walks into a den of hardened, drug dealing, knife and gun wielding killers and starts talking big the movie almost sinks under the weight of it's own execution.  But then Hit Girl and Big Daddy appear and this film gets seriously awesome.  I thought the filmmakers decision to go ALL OUT with the violence was bold and refresingly different.  And yes I realize that it's kindof ridiculous to refer to ultraviolence as refreshing, but I'm tired of Hollywood's habit of pg13-ing their films for the sake of the the box office take.  Most superhero films suck because they are so vanilla and inoffensive that they end up being basically fluff.  The fillmakers on Kick Ass went in the exact opposite direction and made a film that probably had to be edited for content to avoid an NC-17 rating.  The one scene that genuinely disturbed was when Hit Girl brutally kills a fleeing woman.  But again I think my revulsion of that particular bit is overshadowed by my admiration of the filmmakers for having the guts to pull no punches in the realization of their vision.  There are action sequences here that are as good or better than any I have ever seen.  The plot twists sometimes don't make sense - there is a bit where Dave (Kick Ass's alter ego) pretends to be gay that really sucked - and Kick Ass himself is the film's weakest link but on the whole this film rules.  I don't think the filmmakers were trying to satirize anything, I think they were trying to make a good violent action flick.

1306040,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002ZG983M,Turfseer,"[20, 93]","*** This review contains spoilers ***Kick-ass is the story of one Dave Lizewski, an 'ordinary', semi-nerdy high school student who can't understand why anyone in his age group never attempted to become a superhero in real life. You would think that such a premise has real comic possibilities but humorless director Matthew Vaughn decides to take things in a different direction. Right off the bat, Vaughn sets a nasty tone by serving up a mentally unbalanced young man, jumping off a building dressed in a superhero costume. The bad vibes are compounded when Lizewski's Mom drops dead of a aneurysm at the breakfast table. Fun stuff!!!The Act I set-up is full of the clich&eacute;s and stereotypes typical of many 'youth' movies of today. For example, there's the obligatory scene where a couple of thugs steal a cellphone and comic books belonging to the good guy high school students. Then there's the stereotypical antagonist, Frank D'Amico, a vulgar comic-book Mafioso whose goons kill two hapless drug dealers in two repetitious scenes that occur within about ten minutes of one another (in one scene, the goons chop off the guy's finger and then shoot him and in a more repulsive scene, a man bursts like a balloon in a giant microwave).Vaughn attempts to conjure up a modern-day 'Don Quixote' figure with his geeky Lizewski. The nerd courts his 'Dulcinea', the attractive but morally bankrupt Katie who's been dating a drug dealer. His first quest to prove himself to Katie fails miserably after he takes on the two thugs who had robbed him earlier and ends up getting stabbed in the stomach, then hit by a car and almost dies. Fortunately when found, he convinces the paramedics not to let anyone know he was wearing his Kick-ass costume; but the rumor gets out anyway that he was found naked and is now presumed to be gay by most students at the school (including Katie who befriends but also patronizes him as she also assumes he's gay).Kick-ass could have gone in a more clever direction by having Lizewski train hard in martial arts and actually become a truly competent 'superhero' in the vein of Bruce Wayne (aka Batman). But instead it's pure luck that he survives the gang fight which he attempts to break up on the streets and in so doing becomes an internet sensation on Youtube. Lizewski continues with his 'Man of La Mancha' act by paying Katie's boyfriend a visit and again naively attempts to intervene on her behalf. As it turns out, 'Big Daddy' and 'Hit-Girl' save the passive Kick-ass's ass!Now I have no problem with Damon Macready's story arc which involves the former cop attempting to take revenge on bad guy D'Amico after being framed. But what kind of message is being sent when he involves his ten year old daughter in his thirst for revenge? It's wholly inappropriate to depict a ten year old girl being trained by her father to become a professional assassin. Equally inappropriate is when teenager Chris D'Amico aka Red Mist shoots Hit-Girl--what completely makes no sense at all is that Red Mist is upset when his father's thugs carry off his buddy Kick-ass but he has no guilt whatsoever in shooting a ten year old girl? One other thing: after Frank is dispatched, doesn't Chris realize his father is dead? Does he try to find out what happened to his father or does it even occur to him? The bottom line is that the teenager shows no emotions at all which is not in keeping with the character's earlier scenes where he displayed affection for his father.The stupidity of Vaughn's comic book world is further on display when Frank D'Amico mistakenly shoots the wrong Kick-ass in broad daylight. You would think that the head of an organized crime family would be smart enough to realize that there are plenty of people walking around the city in the Kick-ass costume after the character goes viral over the internet. As for Lizewski's revelation to Katie that he's actually Kick-ass--suddenly bad girl Katie is transformed into a saint and falls for him hook, line and sinker. But Lizewski gets rewarded for finally realizing that he was a dumb ass all along! Some hero!The Kick-ass finale is perhaps the most repulsive aspect of the film. Big Daddy and Kick-ass are tortured on live television and then when the networks refuse to show the gory feed, all the voyeurs run to their computers to watch the sorry spectacle online. Finally, Vaughn resurrects his sadistic ten year old after she's shot, who then proceeds to dispatch one Mafia goon after another, in one unspeakably violent scene after another.Somehow after seeing a film like this, I kind of feel that something should be done about our current child labor laws. Rather than having accolades heaped upon Director Vaughn, perhaps the best place for him would be a secure lock-up--criminal or psychiatric, take your pick.",1,Director Vaughn exploits children in

His stylization, instinct, and control over musical score is what contributed to a great film.  He will go on to make many more awesome movies, and I intend to view his earlier work.With that being said, Kick-Ass is near-perfect.  Everything about the film is great, but I have one bone to pick with the casting.  I really wanted Chris Mintz-Plasse as Red Mist to work.  Sadly if failed in nearly every one of his scenes for me.  I read the comic, and maybe I expected too much.  But after thinking about it, I realized that Chris doesn't do justice to the comic or the film.  Red Mist needed to be more sleazy and bratty, instead of goofy and sympathetic.  Kick-Ass could have been so much more if the Red Mist role wasn't so satirical.  I've seen Chris's work in Role Models as well as Superbad and I am aware of his expanding potential.  It's just too bad he didn't differentiate enough here.Besides that little bugger, I enjoyed Kick-Ass thouroughly.  I put it about even in enjoyment with the comic, and both versions have their pros and cons.  I watch this film for: Nic Cage's amazing performance, Aaron Standford's perfect interpretation, the versatile and awesome fight scenes, top-notch writing, and the fresh/original style of the film.  The final two seconds of the film makes me cringe with dislike, but the previous portion of the film is fantastic.  It is a shame that Kick-Ass didn't get more recognition, because it's better than most films out there.On blu-ray, Kick-Ass rocks!  There's a reason why it topped the charts when it first came home, and that's because it's an essential to any blu-ray collection.

It can be anything from a landmark moment in a characters past or a discovery of a power that no other mortal posesses. You know the history and all the iconic names that go along with those origins, but what if you were just an ordinary person who felt the need to just help the innocent and just go out there and kick some evil ass? Well that is pretty much what Kick-Ass did.Kick-Ass is the story of an average comic loving nerd that suddenly felt two things needed to be done. Evil needed to be punished and he needed to get laid. So after many attempts he finally became the green and yellow scuba suit wearing hero 'Kick-Ass' What he didn't count on was that being a super-hero wasn't going to be such a cake walk. On his journey he encounters others who are out there vanquishing evil and it is not such an easy job.'Kick-Ass' as much as I was anticipating to see this movie ended up surpasing my expectations. I had never seen a movie that was as hystercially funny turn into such a slap-happy over the top gore-fest with some extremly serious moments as well. it was as if Quinten Tarantino directed Superbad. The acting was amazing and every actor gave 110%. I also loved the fact that there was a female character that girls could admire...not neceserally look up to because well Chloe Mortez is only 13 years old.
