I love music like the Rolling Stones,Conway Twitty and so on. Once my husband turned the channel by mistake and we heard them sing and now were hooked. The performers are from every walk of life and some had a lot of troubles. Bill G. brought them through their hard times and they love him dearly. They have a lot of laughs and tears.

I loved the testimonies of the Homecoming friends about the things they the Lord has blessed them with.  It was good to see them sitting around a Thanksgiving table sharing their faith and their thankfulness to God for His many blessings.

I do recommend it to those who like Gaither music. If you have never purchased a Gaither DVD before, then I recommend ""I do Believe,"" ""Singing in my Soul,"" or ""Rocky Mountain Homecoming."" Those would be better to get acquainted with the music. ""I Do Believe"" is just outstanding music by the Gaither Vocal Band; ""Singing in my Soul"" is a lively group singing-type DVD, and the latter was done in Colorado, the singing is good, and scenery is outstanding. There are other too, but those three came to mind.Mickey Thorne",4,giving thanks,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",2010,636,"['Nice', 'DVD', 'Something', 'listen', 'when', 'want', 'just', 'lay', 'back', 'take', 'Good', 'music', 'lot', 'thanksgiving', 'do', 'recommend', 'who', 'Gaither', 'music', 'have', 'never', 'purchased', 'Gaither', 'DVD', 'then', 'recommend', 'do', 'Believe', 'Singing', 'Soul', 'Rocky', 'Mountain', 'Homecoming', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'get', 'acquainted', 'music', 'Do', 'Believe', 'just', 'outstanding', 'music', 'Gaither', 'Vocal', 'Band', 'Singing', 'Soul', 'lively', 'group', 'singing-type', 'DVD', 'latter', 'was', 'done', 'Colorado', 'singing', 'good', 'scenery', 'outstanding', 'are', 'other', 'too', 'three', 'came', 'mind.Mickey', 'Thorne']",N/A
