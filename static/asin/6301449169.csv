But the plot....Oh, dear, I do not think I ever saw anything more disgusting.Drake plays a brainless (though very smart from a practical point of view) ...uneducated and rather low class female who has about 1,5 thought in her head - just to get married, whatever the cost. It does not matter that the man she decides to marry does not want either her, or the marriage and ""happy"" family life. Grant plays his usual charming hero - only in that case his gentlemanly charm turns against him as a more realistic man would have told that female barracuda to go and get lost. Instead he sees the trap and walks into it - an attitude that I could only qualify as perfectly [uneducated].The lady in question does all kind of absolutely irresponsible things (borrows an expensive dress, plays couple of man one against the other, lies, cheats in every possible way) and later has the gull to complain how unfortunate she is when she has to pay for the ruined dress and take some responsibility - mostly financial- for her own cunning schemes.The most unnerving thing is a clear realisation at the end that the lady is going to be a ruin of her family and probably future kids as she has absolutely no doubts where and in what there happines lies - in her, of course. No other opinion is going to be considered - she knows better than anybody else what they need.Gaaa! What a disgusting movie.

It is a very entertaining ROM COM and I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates old movies.  The problem to me is the DVD-R.  My experience with them is that the discs are poor quality and the transfers come out with poor audio and visual quality.  They are also over priced.  Another down side is that while they will play in my DVD Player, it is extremely disappointing to my parents because they can not play them in their DVD Recorder, nor can my son play them in his computer.  It is so frustrating that quite a few really great titles from older collections are only being offered on DVD-R.  Along with EGSBM, there are other titles that we have been waiting for their arrival on DVD for a long time and because they are movies we know and love, I might actually consider purchasing them at this price but NOT on DVD-R.  I have also viewed many DVD-R titles that I have not seen before that look like they would be very good based on reviews, actors/directors and story lines but again the hold up is the DVD-R format.  In the big picture, I am very concerned that many of these great movies will ONLY be released on DVD-R and those of us who do not choose this format will never be able to enjoy them.Another side note:  I have purchsed 3 different titles of hard-to-find movies that I found to be DVD-R format when they arrived but this fact was not shown anywhere in the listing.",2,"LOVE THE MOVIE, Do NOT Like DVD-R Transfers",1308182400,"06 16, 2011",2011,1461,"['taped', 'movie', 'AMC', 'close', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'loved', 'very', 'entertaining', 'ROM', 'COM', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'old', 'movies', 'problem', 'DVD-R.', 'My', 'experience', 'discs', 'are', 'poor', 'quality', 'transfers', 'come', 'out', 'poor', 'audio', 'visual', 'quality', 'are', 'also', 'priced', 'down', 'side', 'will', 'play', 'DVD', 'Player', 'extremely', 'disappointing', 'parents', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'DVD', 'Recorder', 'can', 'son', 'play', 'computer', 'so', 'frustrating', 'quite', 'few', 'really', 'great', 'titles', 'older', 'collections', 'are', 'only', 'being', 'offered', 'DVD-R', 'EGSBM', 'are', 'other', 'titles', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'arrival', 'DVD', 'long', 'time', 'are', 'movies', 'know', 'love', 'might', 'actually', 'consider', 'purchasing', 'price', 'NOT', 'DVD-R', 'have', 'also', 'viewed', 'many', 'DVD-R', 'titles', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'look', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'based', 'reviews', 'actors/directors', 'story', 'lines', 'again', 'hold', 'up', 'DVD-R', 'format', 'big', 'picture', 'am', 'very', 'concerned', 'many', 'great', 'movies', 'will', 'ONLY', 'be', 'released', 'DVD-R', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'choose', 'format', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'them.Another', 'side', 'note', 'have', 'purchsed', '3', 'different', 'titles', 'hard-to-find', 'movies', 'found', 'be', 'DVD-R', 'format', 'when', 'arrived', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'anywhere', 'listing']",N/A

This movie played fine, although it had minimal menus. I have since ordered several more Warner Archive movies and found them all to work fine on my DVD and Blu-Ray players.  The price seems a little more than it should be, at first, but to get a good product, along with knowing the DVD is coming from the studio, and not someone who is burning it illegally, is acceptable in these days and times.I was curious about the movie, itself, since Cary Grant and Betsy Drake actually married each other several years after EVERY GIRL SHOULD BE MARRIED was filmed.  As charming as Cary Grant could be, Ms Drake was equally so, as the lady who sets her sights on ""her"" man, and never backs down.It is a wonderful movie, and at first I only was going to give it four stars, and then I realized that I really couldn't think of anything that could have made it better. It is a great couples movies and provides many moments for one to reflect on the differences in approaches to courtship that have developed over the last 60 or so years.

I've been looking for it for years. Happily, the film retains its charms.Cary Grant plays Dr. Brown, a happily unmarried pediatrician who bumps into the quirky Anabel Sims at an old-fashioned drug store. Anabel is a whimsical gal who quickly places Dr. Brown as her long lost husband-to-be. She get's busy learning everything she can about him to set her plan in place. Diana Lynn plays her slightly bewildered friend. Franchot Tone steps in as Brown's ""rival"".This is a fun pic and I'm thrilled that Amazon is carrying it. Until a couple weeks ago it was impossible to find this on DVD. Only old copies of the library releases were available.Now, there is no real menu, only a press and play. There are no chapters, no extras. However, you can move around the film by increments of 10 minutes by pressing the skip button. The film quality and sound are good--clear, even in this age of HD. There are no obvious imperfections in the image. It's a nice, haloed silver. It may have been edited for time. I seem to remember some scenes lounging on the roof, by a fire and in the department store that aren't there, but someone else will confirm or deny...Actually, I think one of the best things about this film is the music.
