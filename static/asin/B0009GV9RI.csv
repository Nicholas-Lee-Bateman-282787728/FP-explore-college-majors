I do this one once a week (working out 4-5 times per week with other vids also).  The music is motivating, as is Keli Roberts - I wish she had more videos.  The strength training intervals are also great in that the reps are longer than most videos, but not boring. I use 5-8 lb. weights right now, but am looking to move up to 10lbs soon (except for shoulder work, which for the normal exerciser, requires lighter weights).

You can either do the interval training that way or use the menu to do only the step or only the weights.  The music is great and the moves are fun.  I'm not very coordinated so I learned the moves first without using my step and then added that in.The only two issues I have with this DVD is a) the weight lifting is beneficial but isn't enough to produce the muscles the ladies in the DVD have.  You would have to do a regular weight lifting program to get results they have, and b) the menu allows you to choose your individual workout, but the weight/strength portions are still spread into different segments, so I still have to click on my remote multiple times to do all the strenth portions alone.Overall, it is a great, fun DVD and worth getting if you're looking for a step, interval program.",4,Fun step and light weight lifting DVD,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,932,"['first', 'Kelly', 'Roberts', 'DVD', 'love', 'program', 'portions', 'step', 'segments', 'weight', 'segments', 'can', 'either', 'do', 'interval', 'training', 'way', 'use', 'menu', 'do', 'only', 'step', 'only', 'weights', 'music', 'great', 'moves', 'are', 'fun', ""'m"", 'not', 'very', 'coordinated', 'so', 'learned', 'moves', 'first', 'using', 'step', 'then', 'added', 'only', 'two', 'issues', 'have', 'DVD', 'weight', 'lifting', 'beneficial', ""n't"", 'enough', 'produce', 'muscles', 'ladies', 'DVD', 'have', 'would', 'have', 'do', 'regular', 'weight', 'lifting', 'program', 'get', 'results', 'have', 'b', 'menu', 'choose', 'individual', 'workout', 'weight/strength', 'portions', 'are', 'still', 'spread', 'different', 'segments', 'still', 'have', 'click', 'remote', 'multiple', 'times', 'do', 'strenth', 'portions', 'alone.Overall', 'great', 'fun', 'DVD', 'getting', ""'re"", 'looking', 'step', 'interval', 'program']",CIA 2303: Step It Strong Featuring Keli Roberts

I've graduated to more vigorous routines since then and found this one much too easy for my current fitness level.  Even so, this would be a great workout for the beginning exerciser.

I do her 10 Minute Solution Kickbox regularly; and now this one is also going to be a steady routine in my workouts.This is a great mix of cardio and weights.  It is similar to Kathy Smith's Fat Burning Breakthrough, except that there is more emphasis on strength training than step cardio.  Since I am working on building up muscle and metabolism, that makes this video more suited for my needs.  My back, arms and thighs were very sore after this, which was a good thing because I am not as challenged these days as I would like to be.The step combinations are probably challenging.  I've taken my share of step/dance classes, so these weren't a big deal for me, but I could see how someone less experienced would be thrown for a loop.  My advice is keep at it and you'll get it.

Even now, I still do this workout every now and then to boost my metabolism again, because it's tough but so effective and fun.In this, there are aerobic/toning intervals for a little under 40 minutes (the most effective way to burn fat and calories) and then there is body sculpting.  It is tough, but so worth while.  She is very motivating yet has a no-nonsense method.  The choreography is great and makes it fun.  It is an advanced workout, so don't jump right into this if you haven't worked out for a while.

I do cardio, yoga, and weights fairly regularly, and was sore for two days after the first try!  I've done Keli's previous step and kick boxing work outs, and was looking to increase the intenisty, in particular on the weight/strength side.  This workout is perfect.  The step segments are simple but intense, and very effective -- I found nothing dancey-foo foo here, except for a mambo cha-cha at the end, which is a fairly standard move.  My favorite thing about Keli as an instructor is that she doesn't dumb down the workouts: she assumes you are capable, and challenges you from the get-go with advanced moves such as push-ups topped off by side plank, but as always provides modifications for beginners.  I end this workout feeling great mentally and physically, knowing I have accomplished a great workout.  After about a month, I noticed a huge difference in  my ability to sustain tough yoga poses, particularly shoulder stand and full back bend, and I've been able to increase the weight during the freeweight segments of this workout.

905240,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,B0009GV9RI,Sheri in Reho,"[40, 46]","I first discovered Keli Roberts through the DVD Kickbox Bootcamp, which is one of the 10-Minute Solution series.  I LOVE that workout, but this one I was more ambivalent about.Despite the fact that I am fit, work out regularly, and take a challenging step aerobics class every week, the step portions of Step It Strong were just too much for me--too high impact and too ""dancey foo foo"" (too many directional changes up and over the step).  About halfway through, I completely gave up on following her increasingly complicated choreography and did my own thing just so I could get some exercise.  Her cueing is not good enough for as complicated as the choreography is and there is no teaching a step slowly before you do it...nor any instructional section on the DVD to help with this.  I kept having to rewind the DVD to the step I didn't catch, pause the DVD, and then step through the move second-by-second to break the steps down so I could figure out how to do them.  Perhaps these are common steps for some people--definitely not in my aerobics class--but then the class I go to is happily NOT ""dancey foo foo.""In contrast, I quite enjoyed the weight training segments of this DVD and was able to keep up with them.  I loved that her weight training segments aren't the same series of exercises that everyone does.  Sure she does the typical bicep curl and tricep kickback, but she does a lot of more unusual things for the back and shoulders too, and that was fantastic.Just as a side note for those who are older or have knee trouble, the whole workout is fairly punishing on the knees between the step cardio and the many and varied types of lunges done on and off the step.I am glad that I rented this DVD vs. buying it sight unseen. On the other hand, I'm actually considering buying the DVD just for the weight training portions.  Because of the ""pick and choose"" menu system, you can just do the weight training workouts or just do the step workouts or you can do them as filmed (an integrated series of step sessions followed by weight training sessions).If you are looking for an advanced workout and you love the ""dancey foo foo"" style of aerobics, you will no doubt love this.  I would definitely not recommend it to a beginner who is just starting out with exercise.",3,"I love Keli's Kickbox Bootcamp, but didn't like the step portion of this one.",1139616000,"02 11, 2006",2006,2285,"['first', 'discovered', 'Keli', 'Roberts', 'DVD', 'Kickbox', 'Bootcamp', 'one', '10-Minute', 'Solution', 'series', 'LOVE', 'workout', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'ambivalent', 'fact', 'am', 'fit', 'work', 'out', 'regularly', 'take', 'challenging', 'step', 'aerobics', 'class', 'week', 'step', 'portions', 'Step', 'Strong', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'high', 'impact', 'too', 'dancey', 'foo', 'foo', 'too', 'many', 'directional', 'changes', 'up', 'step', 'halfway', 'completely', 'gave', 'up', 'following', 'increasingly', 'complicated', 'choreography', 'did', 'own', 'thing', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'get', 'exercise', 'cueing', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'as', 'complicated', 'choreography', 'teaching', 'step', 'slowly', 'do', 'instructional', 'section', 'DVD', 'help', 'kept', 'having', 'rewind', 'DVD', 'step', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'pause', 'DVD', 'then', 'step', 'move', 'second-by-second', 'break', 'steps', 'down', 'so', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'do', 'Perhaps', 'are', 'common', 'steps', 'people', 'definitely', 'not', 'aerobics', 'class', 'then', 'class', 'go', 'happily', 'NOT', 'dancey', 'foo', 'foo', 'contrast', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'weight', 'training', 'segments', 'DVD', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'up', 'loved', 'weight', 'training', 'segments', 'are', ""n't"", 'same', 'series', 'exercises', 'everyone', 'Sure', 'typical', 'bicep', 'curl', 'tricep', 'kickback', 'lot', 'more', 'unusual', 'things', 'back', 'shoulders', 'too', 'was', 'fantastic.Just', 'side', 'note', 'who', 'are', 'older', 'have', 'knee', 'trouble', 'whole', 'workout', 'fairly', 'punishing', 'knees', 'step', 'cardio', 'many', 'varied', 'types', 'lunges', 'done', 'step.I', 'am', 'glad', 'rented', 'DVD', 'buying', 'sight', 'unseen', 'other', 'hand', ""'m"", 'actually', 'considering', 'buying', 'DVD', 'just', 'weight', 'training', 'portions', 'pick', 'choose', 'menu', 'system', 'can', 'just', 'do', 'weight', 'training', 'workouts', 'just', 'do', 'step', 'can', 'do', 'filmed', 'integrated', 'series', 'step', 'sessions', 'followed', 'weight', 'training', 'sessions', '.If', 'are', 'looking', 'advanced', 'workout', 'love', 'dancey', 'foo', 'foo', 'style', 'aerobics', 'will', 'doubt', 'love', 'would', 'definitely', 'not', 'recommend', 'beginner', 'who', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'exercise']",CIA 2303: Step It Strong Featuring Keli Roberts
905241,A34C7SOQL935W3,B0009GV9RI,T. Davis,"[2, 2]","I bought this DVD specifically because it included stepping, but I was a little disappointed.  Keli's routines are easier than Cathe Freidrich's, Christi Taylor's and Rob Glick's, but her choreography offers its own unique challenges.  Keli uses unique step moves (like a  triple knee where you jump to switch knees in the middle) without detailed explanation and I had to immediately modify to avoid injury.  I'll admit I'm a klutz, but I'm a klutz who's fairly adept at stepping.The good news about the step routines is that they're brief and there are only four or five of them in the 77 minute workout.  But I guess that's my other complaint.  The title of the DVD was a little misleading given that the majority of the workout is strength training.However, I'll stop my complaining here.  What Keli lacks as a step instructor (poor cuing, unique moves) she makes up for as a strength training instructor.  In those sections she absolutely shines because she offers very thorough instruction and safety tips.Fortunately, the DVD is programmable and one option is to play all the strength sections without the stepping.  So buy a Gin Miller step workout and combine it with Keli's strength training if you want an excellent overall workout.
