[zero spoilers]Can the best get any better, the stunned viewer (me) asks himself (see the brief answer in this review's title). One possible answer comes from watching LOST's Season 5 and, in this viewer's opinion it's a 'yes'.I keep hearing that Season's 6th, 121 episode it's going to be the last and that's such a pity. Season 5, finally, provides SOME hints of how SOME of the mysteries may be explained in the end but, unlike most TV shows, 5 years later, LOST isn't one bit tired and, if anything, the there is as much potential in the plot lines and as much enthusiasm and talent on display as in the beginning if not more - the actors are seem to have gotten actually better and there is so much substance and background associated to the characters they play.LOST is a masterpiece of a complex story - and now we know that there is one dedicated person in charge of making sure that there are no contradictions or time/space/identity inconsistencies across over 100 individual episodes. LOST delivers some of the most striking images in the history of a TV series and LOST takes full advantage of high-definition television - it could not be what it is in the pre-high definition era. LOST is just fun to watch, highest quality escapism, the kind of show you can watch over and over and almost never get tired of it or feel like fast forwarding to the next scene or to the next episode.And the awesomeness of LOST extends to the special features. Unlike many 'how did we do this' extras found on other movies/shows, these are almost always interesting to watch and there's also something to learn. Specific to the Blu-ray version, BD-Live takes us to the LOST University - classes are forming now so go register for some. You can learn about philosophy, time travel... many topics and, if you are an A student you WILL make it to the Dean's list. Non-Blu extras includes the exquisitely well-made (80's style) TV episode of 'Mysteries of the Universe'. So well made, in fact, my kid kept asking if THAT was the real-life inspiration for the show - watch it and decide for yourself.Here's a list of the 'extras' to be found on the various discs:- An Epic Day With Richard Alpert - see how LOST was made, last day of Season 5 shooting.- Building 23 & Beyond - more on how LOST is made, this time see the writers at work.- Deleted Scenes - I'm not a fan of these but some may enjoy more of LOST.- LOST 100 - more of 'the making of', this time it's 'episode 100'.- LOST Bloopers - funny, actually.- LOST On Location - Go behind-the-scenes, on-set of seven episodes from Season 5.- LOST UNIVERSITY - a BD-Live feature. I'm still working on my admission as I failed my the test - 17 out of 23 wasn't good enough.- Making Up For LOST Time - the logistics of keeping track of everything across all of those timelines.- Mysteries Of The Universe - quite believable 'documentary' done 80's style.There's not much more to say other than, 'get the Blu version if you can' because LOST was shot in HD and you will lose some of the sparkle if you look at the world of LOST through an upconverter - however, the DVD editions - I had episodes 1-3 on DVD before upgrading to Blu - have probably some of the best DVD picture quality ever seen on a DVD short of the Lord of the Rings movies._____________________________________Note:I received 'Season 5' inside theLost: The Complete Seasons 1-5 [Blu-ray]. This may be a good way to upgrade to Blu but I would watch for a 'sale'.",5,"Yes, it can!

New questions have been raised, but a lot of questions were answered and you feel like you are finally getting somewhere. The biggest mystery is still yet to be solved in my opinion.

1163805,A20F0VHBQ48NFF,B0019LY5IM,Andromeda,"[1, 3]","This show just keeps getting better and better. Season Five was no exception. Every eps. was must see tv from the very beginning learning Ben did move the island to the surprising ending of throwing the bomb down that hatch that may or may not have caused the Incident.They moved the Island. As the Island moved Sawyer, Juliet, Miles and Daniel flashed all over the place before Locke finally moved it again causing it to stop in the seventies when the Dharma Initiative was alive and running the island, Sawyer, Miles, and Juliet end up joining while waiting for Locke to return to the island. Sawyer and Juliet become a new kick ass couple. Miles contiunes to make us all laugh while dealing with daddy issues his father none other then the doctor we've seen in all the videos. Daniel looses his marbles and then makes us cry when he's sent back in time by his mother Eloise only to be shot by her younger self. Oh yeah Charles Widmore is his father I think we have a winner in the worse parentage ever.Of the island Jack, Kate, Sayid, Hurley, and Sun deal with re-entering the world post-island still believing everyone else back on the island is in trouble. This gets pushed further along by arrivals of Locke and then Ben urging and maniplating them all to go back to the island. They all end up heading back to island with the help of Eloise. Jack, Kate, Hurley and Sayid end up back in the 70s when the new plane crashes while Sun, Locke, Frank and Ben end up in 2007 after crashing in the same plane.Ben contiunes to be vie for the best psycho award. After moving the island he's banished from it Ben spends his time preparing for his return. Convincing everyone else to go back, stopping in London to promise Widmore he'd kill Penny in exchange for his own daughter's murder. He talks Locke out of suicide before murdering him and staging it as a suicide. Ah Ben your an overachiever. But once back on the island Ben's forced to ""face the island"" for his crimes. Oddly enough Alex's death appears to be the only one the island's concerned about and not mass murder and his millions of other crimes. The smoke monster delievers the answer via Alex to do everything Locke says. Hmm notnot what I was expecting but that was fun to watch. Surprisingly Ben does everything Locke says even kills Jacob when he's ordered too. Oh that wasn't Locke....oops. On the other hand maybe that was the best punishment for Ben. Good job IslandLocke poor Locke he flashes around the island with Sawyer and the gang learning the only way he can fix everything is bring everyone back to the island. Unfortunately, he has to die to do it. Locke tries desperately to convince the Oceanic Six to return to the island with no luck. The is murdered by Ben and returned to the island in a coffin.Once back on the island Locke is a new man. He has a direction, a purpose, he has fun Ben setting out to see the leader Jacob who no one appears to have ever seen except the never aging Richard. Turns out Jacob does exists unfortunately, Locke is not Locke and has dreamed of killing Jacob for ages.Jacob- to my surprised actually exists in the last eps he is shown having visited every Oceanic Six and Sawyer at a turning point in their lives. Its hard to tell if he's good or evil. He gets Kate out of shopping lifting at an early age, gives Sawyer the pen to write his letter, and distracts Sayid and Nadia which ends up in Nadia's death. While Kate and Sawyer probably would have grown up the same Nadia probably wouldn't have been in the middle of the road when she was killed however if Ben was right about the man who killed her (which its been so who knows) he might have killed Sayid instead. Hurley was the only one Jacob talked to after the island and Jacob appears to have healed Locke so he may be Good but this is LOST so who knows.Esau- and Not Locke-Guy who wants Jacob dead or Esau as some of LOST boards have been calling him- Esau wants Jacob dead. Jacob keeps bringing people to the island who fight and destroy. Esau insists it will always be the same Jacob insists there's only one ending and keeps bring people. Esau wants to kill Jacob. And he doe. By using Locke and convince Ben to kill Jacob which he does. But Locke's body was found in the box so has Esau been impersonating dead people all this time? Is the smoke monster? What does this all mean?The second crash-Everyone else who didn't flash to the 70s or run off with Ben are heading to the broken Statuewith a huge box containing the dead Locke to see Richadus or Richard. One of them was visited by Jacob in a hospital. Richard is shocked to see Locke's dead body. Are they the whos coming? That Jacob warned Esau about. Or Jack and the crew coming back from the 70s after Juliet denonated the bomb? Or someone else?Desmond- Desmond beats up Ben. Desmon beats up Ben. That was awsome and a long time coming. Desmond's also the only one who's the most correct about the island that there all just a pawn in someone else's game. Jacob and Esau? Or just one or other? There wasn't nearly enough Desmond this season.The Bomb-Did it flash at the end? Or cause the incident? Or did it reset things? That's what I love about this show figuring out what the hell is going on. I so hope Juliet isn't dead.There's millions of other things that happened on this season that I left out or forgot about. But that's what's amazing about LOST there are millions of questions, theories and things happening in each ep that its impossible to name them all or figure them out. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and trying to figure it out right along with the show. Just when you think you've got it all figured out like there's no Jacob they turn it all around on you. God I love this show. Its so good. I can't wait to see how it all ends next season.But there is one small down side. Kate- I don't know if its the actress or the storylines for her but she is the weakest link on the show. The charactor sucks the energy right out of the show. The Jack and Kate arc was by far the most boring part of LOST. I can't blame Jack because even he gets better when Kate's not around. She has become by far the most useless charactor. There's no reason for her to be on the show anymore. She does nothing and she adds nothing to the story.",5,Five Stars + Spoilers Follow,1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,6284,"['show', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'Season', 'Five', 'was',

My family has been hooked on ""Lost,"" ever since we discovered the fun of the series when I purchased Season 1 late in 2006.  Even though we have watched most of the shows on television when they were aired ever since, we have still looked forward to the clean, fresh DVD's (commercial free!) to tell the story even better.Season 5 doesn't disappoint at all, as far as the story line goes.  In some ways, it is the most unpredictable and the most imaginative of all.  And some of those questions that have been nagging us start to get answered.  And despite what the writers may say, I STILL think that they are ALL in purgatory.However, there are a few things that cause me to lower my rating of this particular purchase.  First, the number of episodes in an otherwise-full season is disappointing.  I feel a little cheated that it stops at 16 (or 17, depending on how you count).  But that's the way it is.The packaging leaves much to be desired.  First, there is absolutely nothing, in terms of an episode guide in the box ... only numbers and titles.  But most of all, WHY oh WHY did they change the package?  Now I have 4 seasons that match, and a 5th one that does not.  Makes me think that the producers know that there are those of us who are so obsessive that the fail-to-match boxes will lead us to go back out and buy the entire series again, when it is produced in one box after the final season!!Seems to be a small thing, but it bugs me and I just had to tell about that!

1163815,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B0019LY5IM,B. Martin,"[0, 0]","Lost has always hinted at time travel, but in season 5 the show's creators finally decided to stop tiptoeing around the issue and tackle it head on.  The new tagline for the series became ""When are we?"" and viewers were asked to wrap their collective heads around concepts such as skewed time lines in which the characthers' futures became their pasts, or the idea that the past can't be changed.  But all of the headache inducing (for the characthers as well as the viewers) time travel only served to enhance the drama and make the series more intriguing as it began setting the table for its final season.Season 5 picks up where season 4 ended:  the island has disappeared after Ben turned the magic donkey wheel.  Meanwhile it was revelaed that Locke had made it off the island only to end up committing suicide; but not before trying to convince the Oceanic 6 to return and fulfill their destinites.We quickly learn that the fate of those who remained on the island.  After Ben's departure, the island started moving through time.  Daniel Farraday likens the movement to a record skpping, a connection that devoted fans will immediately draw to the series' ongoing motiff of records and turntables.  As the Losties travel through time, they begin to experience some undesired side effects which include headaches and bloody noses.  Why is the island moving?  What will stop it?  Why are the survivors suffering the strange effects?  Don't worry, some answers are provided.Meanwhile, the Oceanic Six struggle to return to the island with the help of Ben and Eloise Hawking, a coming war is hinted at, we learn how Locke left the island, Jin is found to still be alive, the losties end up as members of the Dharma Initiative and we finally meet Jacob in the season finale.A lot happens in season 5, and trying to summarize it is almost impossible.  But what keeps the show from spinning completely off its axis and becoming an inaccessible mess is the human element.  The characters are so vividly drawn that we have a strong vested interest in what happens to them.  Especially engrossing is Sawyer's storyline.  This is the season when his development from a hot-headed, selfish and angry loner to an actual human being with deep feelings and a sense of purpose was completed.  Believe it or not, he is the human heart of season 5.The finale provides a a rather large plot twist and puts everything in place for the final season.  Who knows how it's all going to end and what everything means, but I'm on board to the very end, no matter what that end may be.",5,Lost in time,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,2564,"['Lost', 'always', 'hinted', 'time', 'travel', 'season', '5', 'show', 'creators', 'finally', 'decided', 'stop', 'tiptoeing', 'issue', 'tackle', 'head', 'new', 'tagline', 'series', 'became', 'When', 'are', 'viewers', 'were', 'asked', 'wrap', 'collective', 'heads', 'concepts', 'such', 'skewed', 'time', 'lines', 'characthers', 'futures', 'became', 'pasts', 'idea', 'past', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'changed', 'headache', 'inducing', 'characthers', 'as', 'well', 'viewers', 'time', 'travel', 'only', 'served', 'enhance', 'drama', 'make', 'series', 'more', 'intriguing', 'began', 'setting', 'table', 'final', 'season.Season', '5', 'up', 'where', 'season', '4', 'ended', 'island', 'disappeared', 'Ben', 'turned', 'magic', 'donkey', 'wheel', 'Meanwhile', 'was', 'revelaed', 'Locke', 'had', 'made', 'off', 'island', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'committing', 'suicide', 'not', 'trying', 'convince', 'Oceanic', '6', 'return', 'fulfill', 'destinites.We', 'quickly', 'learn', 'fate', 'who', 'remained', 'island', 'Ben', 'departure', 'island', 'started', 'moving', 'time', 'Daniel', 'Farraday', 'movement', 'record', 'skpping', 'connection', 'devoted', 'fans', 'will', 'immediately', 'draw', 'series', 'ongoing', 'motiff', 'records', 'turntables', 'Losties', 'travel', 'time', 'begin', 'experience', 'undesired', 'side', 'effects', 'include', 'headaches', 'bloody', 'noses', 'Why', 'island', 'moving', 'What', 'will', 'stop', 'Why', 'are', 'survivors', 'suffering', 'strange', 'effects', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'answers', 'are', 'provided.Meanwhile', 'Oceanic', 'Six', 'struggle', 'return', 'island', 'help', 'Ben', 'Eloise', 'Hawking', 'coming', 'war', 'hinted', 'learn', 'how', 'Locke', 'left', 'island', 'Jin', 'found', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'losties', 'end', 'up', 'members', 'Dharma', 'Initiative', 'finally', 'meet', 'Jacob', 'season', 'finale.A', 'lot', 'season', '5', 'trying', 'summarize', 'almost', 'impossible', 'what', 'show', 'spinning', 'completely', 'axis', 'becoming', 'inaccessible', 'mess', 'human', 'element', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'vividly', 'have', 'strong', 'vested', 'interest', 'what', 'Especially', 'engrossing', 'Sawyer', 'storyline', 'season', 'when', 'development', 'hot-headed', 'selfish', 'angry', 'loner', 'actual', 'human', 'being', 'deep', 'feelings', 'sense', 'purpose', 'was', 'completed', 'Believe', 'not', 'human', 'heart', 'season', '5.The', 'finale', 'rather', 'large', 'plot', 'twist', 'everything', 'place', 'final', 'season', 'Who', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'what', 'everything', ""'m"", 'board', 'very', 'end', 'matter', 'what', 'end', 'may', 'be']",Lost: Season 5

It's not too late to pick up on the shows wonderfully detailed immersible world. Many who don't know, this has yet to be released to DVD/BluRay and we the reviewers are basing it upon the season thus far minus the bonus feature that will be included on the sets.Season five was (in my opinion) the best of the recent seasons matching it with season ones heartfelt emotion and wonders of the beyond. I don't wish to spoil anything for viewers of the show, or people ready to make the jump into the show and become a losty. Though I will say their are multiple time frames, dozens of iconic (for Lost that is) flashbacks, and a cast who can act beyond what I've seen on television as of late.This season has so many moments that leave you mesmerized, shocked, and dumbfounded you crave to watch them all in chronological order. Sometimes you just don't have time to catch them all in order on tv and the continuity becomes even more screwy with the ever deepening plot line. Thankfully the Lost Season 5 boxset will accompany you on the startling, adventures of the lost crew and hopefully give you an indepth look on things we may have overlooked.This season has a couple extra long two hour episodes, and an amazing finale to recap everything, though it yearns to be completed upon the ending of the epic finale. In one year we will have everything (hopefully) answered. It's one of those shows you want to read up on spoilers, but you wish not to spoil it for yourself and begin the wait.Those not familiar with Lost, do yourself a favor if you're interested in it... pick up the first season. The show only becomes more confusing, knowing the characters before they become more fleshed out will help you in the long run. All the previous season up to 4 are readily available and rather cheap to buy, also you can find lost on a few stations.If you don't know what Lost exactly is, well to put it simple we're not too sure either, but we can assure you it's a rewarding show. A downed jet leaves survivors stranded on what appears to be an uncharted island. Together they must coordinate efforts, or die alone. As time progresses you will often see characters unfold themselves and with the use of heavy flashbacks characters are exposed to the viewer and not the survivors. The show has its run of what seem to be stalk characters at first, but they really grow to become some of the best television can present. The island seems to have a few secrets leading some of the survivors either haywire, strongly curious, or in a state of panic.The show isn't for everyone, it is somewhat witty, requires a high attention span, and what some may call pointless others will note for progress. Ones open to something really different, and genuinely intriguing will no doubt find this at least full of quality.",5,Could Not of Asked For a Better Show,1248652800,"07 27, 2009",2009,2904,"['Lost', 'recently', 'ended', 'fifth', 'season', 'fans', 'are', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'sixth', 'final', 'season', 'not', 'too', 'late', 'pick', 'up', 'shows', 'wonderfully', 'detailed', 'immersible', 'world', 'Many', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'be', 'released', 'DVD/BluRay', 'reviewers', 'are', 'basing', 'season', 'thus', 'far', 'bonus', 'feature', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'sets.Season', 'five', 'was', 'opinion', 'best', 'recent', 'seasons', 'matching', 'season', 'ones', 'heartfelt', 'emotion', 'wonders', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'spoil', 'anything', 'viewers', 'show', 'people', 'ready', 'make', 'jump', 'show', 'become', 'losty', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'multiple', 'time', 'frames', 'dozens', 'iconic', 'Lost', 'flashbacks', 'cast', 'who', 'can', 'act', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'television', 'late.This', 'season', 'so', 'many', 'moments', 'leave', 'mesmerized', 'shocked', 'dumbfounded', 'crave', 'watch', 'chronological', 'order', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'catch', 'order', 'tv', 'continuity', 'even', 'more', 'screwy', 'ever', 'deepening', 'plot', 'line', 'Thankfully', 'Lost', 'Season', '5', 'boxset', 'will', 'accompany', 'startling', 'adventures', 'lost', 'crew', 'hopefully', 'give', 'indepth', 'look', 'things', 'may', 'have', 'overlooked.This', 'season', 'couple', 'extra', 'long', 'two', 'hour', 'episodes', 'amazing', 'finale', 'recap', 'everything', 'be', 'completed', 'ending', 'epic', 'finale', 'one', 'year', 'will', 'have', 'everything', 'hopefully', 'answered', 'one', 'shows', 'want', 'read', 'up', 'spoilers', 'wish', 'not', 'spoil', 'begin', 'wait.Those', 'not', 'familiar', 'Lost', 'do', 'favor', ""'re"", 'interested', 'up', 'first', 'season', 'show', 'only', 'more', 'confusing', 'knowing', 'characters', 'become', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out', 'will', 'help', 'long', 'run', 'previous', 'season', 'up', '4', 'are', 'readily', 'available', 'rather', 'cheap', 'buy', 'also', 'can', 'find', 'lost', 'few', 'stations.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Lost', 'exactly', 'well', 'put', 'simple', ""'re"", 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'can', 'assure', 'rewarding', 'show', 'downed', 'jet', 'survivors', 'stranded', 'what', 'be', 'uncharted', 'island', 'Together', 'must', 'coordinate', 'efforts', 'die', 'alone', 'time', 'will', 'often', 'see', 'characters', 'unfold', 'use', 'heavy', 'flashbacks', 'characters', 'are', 'exposed', 'viewer', 'not', 'survivors', 'show', 'run', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'stalk', 'characters', 'first', 'really', 'grow', 'become', 'best', 'television', 'can', 'present', 'island', 'have', 'few', 'secrets', 'leading', 'survivors', 'haywire', 'strongly', 'curious', 'state', 'panic.The', 'show', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'somewhat', 'witty', 'high', 'attention', 'span', 'what', 'may', 'call', 'pointless', 'others', 'will', 'note', 'progress', 'open', 'something', 'really', 'different', 'genuinely', 'intriguing', 'will', 'doubt', 'find', 'least', 'full', 'quality']",Lost: Season 5

Despite several people having told me that season 5 was not up to par when they saw it on TV, I think the show is as strong as ever with this season and am looking forward to starting season 6.",5,Still a Great Show!,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,702,"['Season', '5', 'Lost', 'am', 'now', 'REALLY', 'glad', 'waited', 'show', 'ended', 'go', 'back', 'watch', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'series', 'so', 'close', 'together', 'little', 'nuances', 'questions', 'have', 'been', 'unanswered', 'couple', 'seasons', 'are', 'now', 'finally', 'being', 'tied', 'together', 'still', 'plenty', 'unanswered', 'going', 'Season', '6', '.This', 'season', 'deals', 'time', 'travel', 'can', 'get', 'confusing', 'people', 'so', 'be', 'ready', 'pay', 'extra', 'close', 'attention', 'little', 'stuff', 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'several', 'people', 'having', 'told', 'season', '5', 'was', 'not', 'up', 'par', 'when', 'saw', 'TV', 'think', 'show', 'as', 'strong', 'ever', 'season', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'starting', 'season', '6']",Lost: Season 5

1163829,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0019LY5IM,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 6]","Typically, I would get into depth of the series but I'll keep things simple.  The fifth season of ""LOST"" aired on January 2009 with a total of 17 episodes featured on five Blu-ray discs.  One thing I will stress is that with this season release, there is less special features than the fourth (on the disc) but the benefit are for those who own a BD-Live Profile 2.0 Blu-ray player (can connect to the Internet) with the feature ""LOST University"".  With that being said, if you own a Profile 1.1 or profile 1.0 Blu-ray player, the offering is quite slim compared to previous releases.  So, ratings are going to differ with this release.Similar to the previous ""LOST"" Blu-ray releases, the Blu-ray's allow for ""SeasonPlay"" which allows people to watch as they go and can stop, restart where they last left off.  ""SeasonPlay"" is optional and people can select it before watching an episode.VIDEO & AUDIO:""LOST""  is a series that looks incredible on High Definition.  Featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:78:1), the detail of the island is captured quite vibrantly.  The green lush plants that surround the island, the blue skies, the blue ocean.  Personally, most of the video footage shot in Hawaii tend to be vibrant in colors and ""LOST"" is no exception.  This year's offering is much more detailed.  You can see the skin pores much more closely, even the stubble on the faces of the guys, the arm hairs, detail of crushed metal in the car accidents, Dharma buildings and just regular objects and much, much more.  There is a lot of detail that you just don't see on television and when you see it on Blu-ray, especially for ""LOST - The complete Fifth Season"", you can't help but be amazed.  The colors are just fantastic as blue oceans and blue skies are surrounded by beautiful lush greenery.  Blacks are nice and dark and skin tones are natural.One of the things that caught my attention was just things that you never even looked at while watching on television such as jars, the appearance of rusty jars are really apparent in High Definition.  The stained blood on the skin of the characters, you can actually see that the blood is actually dry.  When comparing Seasons one through four on Blu-ray, there is an obvious difference in the picture quality and where season four looked fantastic, season five just really looks incredible.As for the audio, ""LOST"" is featured in DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.  The dialogue is quite clear but one thing that caught my attention is how magnificent the audio is in terms of capturing the ambiance of the island when each person is moving through the jungle.  This season tends to have used more panning and audio directional to certain speaker channels much more evident than the first season.  Also, sounds of the island, car crashing, metal crunching and even thunderstorms come quite clear through the various surround channels. Also, good use of surrounds and LFE.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and the music also comes out alive during certain scenes.In fact, the final episode ""The Incident"", that is an episode that really takes advantage of each channel.  Hearing audio and crunching metal from the surround channels, hearing the rumble of LFE through the subwoofer and the front and center channels working in overdrive, capturing the frenzy that took place.  Great use of sound!I love how the music for the series sounds and how it really brought an overall mood to certain scenes. The music by Michael Giacchino and the way the orchestra creates that tension for the scenes was awesome.  So, music plays a big part in the series and the music soundtrack is just wonderful!Subtitles are featured in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:The Blu-ray edition of ""LOST - THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON"" is featured in 1080p High Definition and 480i Standard Definition.

Click to access Jorge Garcia explaining the cinematography term ""ass dirt"". (:56)After watching the season four finale of ""LOST"", I just felt that season would be hard to top.  So, along came season five and the season was very good but it was definitely a season that can easily confuse people with the different time period jumps.  But for the most part, season five was quite interesting as we saw different characters receiving more screen time, we got to see how evil Benjamin Linus truly is (and how wonderful an actor Michael Emerson is to play such a role) and seeing some of my favorite character(s) getting killed off was a bit of a hard pill to swallow after the final episode was over.Just the final minute alone of the season finale, I felt saddened... yes, as a dedicated follower of ""LOST"" (yes, I even followed the audio book and a lurker on ""THE FUSELAGE"" online forum), I felt that the season was a bit more restrained but the finale, almost like season three, more than made up for it.  Needless to say, big things are to come in this final sixth season and I look forward to seeing what Damon Lindelof, Carlton Cuse and the writing crew have planned.So, I did enjoy the fifth season of ""LOST"" (not as much as the fourth which was more adventure and action-driven) and since I'm a sci-fi geek, it was it easy for me to take in the sci-fi ""time travel"" aspect of this fifth season, which I'm sure there are people who felt the writers may have been pushing the storyline a bit too far.  But for me, I felt the storyline worked and again, you can sense the writers are going to have fun with this upcoming final season.  I definitely look forward to it.As for the Blu-ray release of ""LOST - THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON"", this has to be the best looking television series on Blu-ray yet.  I was just amazed of how much detail can be seen, things that never caught my attention when watching it on television.  From the skin pores and even the hair on one's arm, to the lush plants and the coarse rocks, the amount of detail that pops is simply amazing.  Audio quality is also used very well through all channels.  From hearing the thunder and rain, the druglord's airplane crashing onto the island to the number of vehicles crashing, gun shots galore and just the ambient sounds are capture quite well and all were great use of lossless audio.As for special features, for those who are looking for a lot of commentaries like previous releases, ""LOST - The complete Fifth Season"" has very few this time around and some who enjoy commentary tracks will be slightly bummed.  But that doesn't mean this season is lacking any special features.  If anything, disc 5 of this set contains plenty of special features that are quite long, quite a few easter eggs hidden and it was great to watch the celebration of the 100th episode of ""LOST"".  But of course, the biggest addition to this Blu-ray is the utilization of BD-Live for the exclusive ""LOST Universe"".It's a great technology for viewers/fans to connect with each other and take part in showing their love for the series.  It's important to note that enjoying ""LOST University"" would depend on those who have BD-Live enabled, profile 2.0 Blu-ray player (a player can connect to the Internet) and is able to utilize the technology.  But those who don't have the capability, I can understand if they are upset that the direction (special feature-wise) was more for those who can experience BD-Live.Overall, this is the most ambitious Blu-ray release for ""LOST"" in terms of special features but also the picture and audio quality is absolutely fantastic.  If you are a major ""LOST"" fan, this latest ""LOST - The Complete Fifth Season"" Blu-ray set is highly recommended!",5,"Blu-ray: Think ""LOST"" could get any better on Blu?

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[13, 17]","It's the beginning of the end for ""Lost"" -- only one more season to go, and plenty of strange destined events yet to be explained.And ""Lost: The Complete Fifth Season"" may be the best season of the show yet, with some unexpected glimpses back into the Island's history, mysterious people, and more explorations of the mysterious Jacob. It feels like the entire season is packed with strange twists and unexpected turns, complete with a trip back in time that illuminates everything that has come before it.Jack joins forces with his former enemy Ben, trying to bring the Oceanic Six back together and get them back to the Island. But Charles Widmore has been sending assassins to kill Hurley and Sayid, and someone is sniffing around Kate's relationship to Aaron. Their only hope of getting back to the Island is to follow the instructions of Eloise Hawking, a woman who has intricate knowledge of time and space -- and the Island.Meanwhile, the Island is randomly leaping through time, flinging Sawyer, Juliet, Daniel, Charlotte and all the others from one time period to another. And when the Oceanic Six (minus a few) arrive on the Island again, they find that it is now 1977 -- Sawyer, Juliet and their friends have all been living there for the past three years, as part of the Dharma Initiative. Sun and Ben end up in the hands of the remaining Others -- along with a supposedly dead man now returned to life.But as the fateful Incident approaches, Jack and Co. end up having their plans unravel around them, and a bunch of gun-toting Dharma people out for their blood. With the help of Daniel Faraday and his mysterious journal, the splintered little group sets out to somehow reset everything that has happened on the Island -- even as Ben and the Others approach an ancient monument, where the Island's fate will be changed forever.There's a sense of melancholy in the fifth season of ""Lost."" Okay, it's never been a cheerful show, but it's clear that many of the plot threads are being wound together, and the characters that are killed have wrenchingly tragic send-offs. What's more, this short season reveals a whole lot more about the Island than we ever knew before -- the stone foot, the Incident, Eloise Hawking's knowledge about time, and the Island's mysterious ruler Jacob.And it's packed solid with plot, full of twists, gory action, flashbacks, flashforwards, and a sense of supernatural suspense. The first half of the season is all about the Six slowly being drawn back to the Island (almost against their will, really) while the second is about the disasters that ensue because of their presence, and the fight against the inevitability of time. It's just a big thick rope of plot twists that tightens itself as it approaches the explosive finale.Fortunately this season is also graced with exceptionally good dialogue, and some funny moments often supplied by the ever-lovable Hurley (example: writing down the ""Empire Strikes Back"" script from memory). And it evolves into straight-out science fiction after sort of flirting with it for the past few seasons.Matthew Fox does a pretty good job as the increasingly irrational, obsessed Jack, but he's overshadowed by Josh Holloway. Holloway is pretty darn brilliant as the new alpha male in the jungle who suddenly has his peaceful domain disrupted. Michael Emerson is also excellent as the vaguely creepy Ben, whose frustrations and anger start boiling over as he tries to somehow fix whatever has gone wrong, only to make a terrible mistake.Actually, most of the cast does an excellent job: Naveen Andrews, Elizabeth Mitchell (especially in the finale), the dry-witted Ken Leung, Jeremy Davies, Yunjin Kim, Daniel Dae Kim, and the ever-awesome Jorge Garcia. There are also some other incredible actors who become pretty prominent here, including Franois Chau, Zuleikha Robinson, the ageless Nestor Carbonell, and the mysterious Fionnula Flanagan.And Mark Pellegrino is introduced as the mysterious Jacob, whose identity, nature and goals are all murky. You're left wondering who this guy is, and if we'll see him again.""Lost: The Complete Fifth Season"" is a tightly-written, intensely-plotted stream of bittersweet sci-fi, and it leaves you hungry for whatever is next.

1163839,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B0019LY5IM,Enjolras,"[1, 1]","Season 5 is a mix between showing what the survivors on the island experienced and how the survivors who returned to America plot their return to the island. More than the others, this season jumps around quite a bit. Some episodes focus on the six in America, then later we get to see what other characters were up to during that time. In fact, I felt like much of season 5 consisted of filling in gaps. Things are even more confusing because there's a lot of time travel in this season. It generally works, but often it means that we don't actually get to see the characters develop over time, just the end results.I really enjoyed seeing how the characters stuck behind on the island grow and adapt to their circumstances. Sawyer and Juliet reach new stages in their character development. Sawyer joins the Dharma Initiative and takes on some responsibility. It's nice to see consequential changes.Unfortunately, Jack and Kate are up their usual selves, rushing off to action without thinking. I'm glad Sawyer called Jack out on it. I wish their characters showed greater maturity and depth. Jack's character seems really inconsistent. In season 5, he seems intent on abandoning responsibility, almost as if the story writers thought they needed to shake the character up.The peripheral characters, such as Dan and Miles, each get their own episodes and flashbacks. Unlike some of the earlier attempts to introduce new characters into the show, I think the show has absorbed these two pretty well.Oh, and why do these people still trust Ben? Why hasn't somebody killed that lying jerk by now? One of the highlights of this season for me was Sun knocking Ben out saying that she didn't trust him.For a while, I was getting sick of how the show tries to keep the mystery by never allowing the characters to explain their motivations. It always seemed that there was ""no time"" for a proper explanation. Fortunately, by the end of this season, we finally get a bit of an explanation that ties things from the various seasons together.

1163842,A2KW2KWKABNYNO,B0019LY5IM,"Flap Jackson ""Sky Is Burning, But At Least We...","[0, 2]","In more ways than one, Lost Season 5 is the best season of one of the greatest shows ever to air on television. It had all the elements that have come to define the show, and make it one of the most enjoyable experiences ever to hit TV. It had great character development, it had great mythology, it had great moments, it was original, and it had a superb story. And let me start off by saying that I'm a time-travel geek. I lay awake at night in fear of time paradoxes and my life being erased. I've also seen most major & obscure takes on the subject, so I followed and understood the whole season with the information that was given. I can see how somebody would get lost easily, but I understood it perfectly, and that's just because of my geekiness. Your experience with Season 5 may vary.Highlight Episodes:The Life and Death of Jeremy BenthamLaFleurNamasteDead Is DeadThe IncidentFirst off, the characters. Ever since Season 1, Lost has struggled with bringing new emotions, and stories that seem like they fit with the character, and not for any cheap or uninteresting side-note or plot device; that is if they even move the characters along. In Season 5, this is not the case, every character matures in a totally different way than we've seen before, and it does them justice. This is especially the case with Sawyer, who after 5 Seasons has finally granted my wish of wanting to see him in a leadership role. But he's no leader like any we've seen on the show before, and he's certainly no Jack. He's still the cool, nickname guy we knew before, but this is a Sawyer that uses his brain for somebody other than himself, and he just does it in some have called a ""Winston Churchill"" type manner. And this description would suit him well. We finally found a stable relationship for Sawyer, and for a long while there, he was one of the few characters on the show that had found some sense of happiness. Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sayid & Sun also progressed well from off-island life to island life, giving each of the characters a real reason to return that again suited their characters well. Heck, even Kate or Jack didn't seem annoying for a while there. Then of course, we saw Miles & Faraday grow into their roles on the show, as they became not only essential to the story, but they found a way into our likability circle. Sure, they may have came late, but especially in the case of Miles now, he fits right in.Story-wise, the season does start off a bit slow do to the whole 'We're Getting The Band Back Together' storyline. Sure it was essential, but it felt like it could have been condensed a bit. But that only lasts for a few episodes, and they're usually inter-spliced with the time-travel story (More on Time-travel later). But once everybody got onto the island, it just rocketed down the path of no return with each episode being slammed-packed with great moments & stuff we've never seen before. Keeping the show on the island, but moving it mostly to the 70s was a great change of pace for the season, and it was fun living in the Dharma world for a little bit, getting to know the characters, events & the company that shaped the island so much, even though we wished Radzinsky had bit the bullet early from the moment he started opening his mouth. But overall, I couldn't have been much more satisfied with the arch the season took, and it did a nice job of setting up the final season.As for the time-travel, I was stunned how the show took it in such an amazing/original direction. I mean, the whole island moves in time, stays in one spot for a while, then takes the castaways to another time period. And some of the stops are pretty amazing. We get to see the island in the 50s, the future, the 80s, and other various unknown points, and what the castaways usually found in these periods was just so fun for any Lost fan. I mean, the moment where the island skips in time, and a rope once dangling from a well was just sticking out of the ground since the well hadn't been built yet. So awesome. But that's not all folks, they presented time travel theories, created the time-loop timeline, and dived deep into the question of 'Can you change the past, or is what done is done? If you try to change the past, do you just eventually set it on its present course?' These are deep questions, and it was just so fun to watch Lost tread ground that most other media hasn't even touched on, much less delved into.Overall, time will tell its true placement in the series' hierarchy, but for me, it was one of the most fun and satisfying experiences watching TV in my lifetime. Sure, it's not for everybody, and it is hard to get a grip on it, but for those that can (and it certainly helps to watch all the episodes in a short span of time), then you might be half as keen to love it as I do. And what about those last 30 seconds? One of the best cliffhangers in TV history, especially if you have the chance to pop in the next episode right afterwards? I say yes.",5,"""We Dropped Out of a Plane and Landed in 1977.

1163843,A1GXBMUTVHWHJL,B0019LY5IM,Flash,"[2, 3]","I remember thinking that season 1 of Lost was the most interesting, most entertaining and most innovative single season of television I had ever watched. While it still ranks at the very top of my list, I have to say that season 5 of Lost (particularly after a second viewing) at least approaches a similar level of overall viewing satisfaction. Mystery of the island aside, this show is really about the characters. And after this watching this season, I feel that things have really fell into place in regard to the character development. After five seasons, you have a pretty good sense of who these characters are, you feel like you've known them for a while. So when Sawyer enter's his ""happy"" stage this season, you really feel good for the guy. You laugh at Hurley because you know who he is by now. You empathize with Locke as he tries to figure out and/or deal with how and why he is so special. You understand Sayid's pain and (IMO loneliness) because of his background. And of course, you second guess and question the motives behind anything that Ben does. The story in season 5 uses everything you know and feel about these characters and begins to set up for the final conclusion. Lost is an excellent show. In the end, it may be the defining television show of this era.The only negative things I can say about Lost (and they are minor) are 1) by now, the Dharma Iniitiave has lost nearly all of its mysteriousness and 2) there appear to be some contradictions as to how difficult it is to get back and forth from the island.",5,Most Cohesive Season Since Season 1,1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,1540,"['remember', 'thinking', 'season', '1', 'Lost', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'most', 'entertaining', 'most', 'innovative', 'single', 'season', 'television', 'had', 'ever', 'watched', 'still', 'very', 'top', 'list', 'have', 'say', 'season', '5', 'Lost', 'particularly', 'second', 'viewing', 'least', 'approaches', 'similar', 'level', 'overall', 'viewing', 'satisfaction', 'Mystery', 'island', 'aside', 'show', 'really', 'characters', 'watching', 'season', 'feel', 'things', 'have', 'really', 'fell', 'place', 'regard', 'character', 'development', 'five', 'seasons', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'sense', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'known', 'while', 'So', 'when', 'Sawyer', 'enter', 'happy', 'stage', 'season', 'really', 'feel', 'good', 'guy', 'laugh', 'Hurley', 'know', 'who', 'now', 'empathize', 'Locke', 'figure', 'out', 'and/or', 'deal', 'how', 'why', 'so', 'special', 'understand', 'Sayid', 'pain', 'IMO', 'loneliness', 'background', 'course', 'second', 'guess', 'question', 'motives', 'anything', 'Ben', 'story', 'season', '5', 'uses', 'everything', 'know', 'feel', 'characters', 'begins', 'set', 'up', 'final', 'conclusion', 'Lost', 'excellent', 'show', 'end', 'may', 'be', 'defining', 'television', 'show', 'only', 'negative', 'things', 'can', 'say', 'Lost', 'are', 'minor', 'are', '1', 'now', 'Dharma', 'Iniitiave', 'lost', 'nearly', 'mysteriousness', '2', 'there', 'appear', 'be', 'contradictions', 'how', 'difficult', 'get', 'back', 'forth', 'island']",Lost: Season 5

I can only say that part of the answer lies with the father figure. Almost all the charcters has had a problem with their father. Plus, you've got Hurley who talks about ""The Empire Strikes Back"" which is known to contain the famous Darth Vader Line ""No Luke. I am your father"". Plus, the creators has said that the end would be kind of biblical. And let's just say that in the Bible, The Father plays a big role. You also have Ben who describe the Passion Of Christ at some point... In that Passion, Jesus begs his father to save him and then reconciles with him. I'm telling you: something with the father figure is at the heart of this TV series.Anyhow, this season gave me the best moment of the whole series. It's a small moment. A lot of people might not even remember. It lasts about 10 seconds and it's about Sawyer, one of the most interesting character, if not the most. At some point, he wakes up and leaves for he was informed that some of his friends were finnaly discovered. Juliete is troubled by it. As he arrives and gets out of his vehicle, what does he see? Hurley, Jack and... Kate getting out of the van. It's been years since he saw her. He even swore to Juliete that he didn't even remember her. And here she is. In front of him. The look on his face... and boum! the episode ends. That particular moment was so touching. Plus, we ourselves could identify with Sawyer cause those characters were absent for a complete episode or two prior to that. I was also glad, like Sawyer, to see them come out of the van. The look on Jack's face. The lines on his forehead. No words. Just emotions and a smile.That moment surpasses the one, in season 3, where Sawyer, chained and forced to break stones, kisses Kate as he cannot control himself anymore. She is so sexy in her dress and covered with sweat. He just drops everything, walk up to her and kisses her and then, he attacks the others as they come to stop him.Boy! That character really gives us strong moments... he's kind of the Han Solo of the Star Wars saga.I still think that season 3 was the best. But season 5 is awesome. It really distances itself from the rest of the series as it embarks on a complete new journey of science-fiction. before, you could almost try (i'm saying ""try"") to explain everything in a scientific way. But in season 5... forget it. We are in complete fantasy. Now it's clear. Science cannot explain everything here. Some people might stop watching ""Lost"" from now on. The creators are now showing their cards. They don't care about new viewers. They are satisfying the old ones.

It starts off with Locke, Sawyer, Juliet, Miles, Ferredy and the redhead Freighter girl stuck on the island together. When Ben turned the wheel in season 4, the island now is constantly moving in time. When they get used to being in one time, the time changes to either the past or the future. Which is a smart way for the writers to introduce us to the Others of the past and Dharma members as well. We also learn some history about the island itself. But the flashes that keeps sending Sawyer and others through time is also slowly killing them. Locke finds a way back home to try and get help for them.While Jack tries to figure out how to get Kate, Hurley, Sun and Sayid to all come back to the island. Well since none of them are interested in returning.It's obvious they get back eventually but I won't give away how. But Sawyer and the others get stuck in the late 70's and Sawyer decides to find a way to join the Dharma group. I always felt bad that the Others killed them but we learn that a lot of them were jerks. We also get to meet the Asian from the Dharma films that Locke and Eko were watching. How his character was used was one of the best things about the season.The season had many surprises and twists.

1163852,AL9WKVMRI6GFB,B0019LY5IM,JMM,"[0, 0]","Many mysteries are revealed during the fifth season of Lost, one of the most entertaining seasons yet.  All the main characters are back.  Jack, with the help of Ben, tries to persuade the rest of the Oceanic Six to return to the island.  Meanwhile, Sawyer creates a new life for himself as a DHARMA security man in the 70s.  Two episodes stand out as my favorites here: ""316"" is the journey back to the island, and ""The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham"" explains just what happened to Locke when he left the island, including how he died.  Time travel is the major theme of this season, and certain episodes require multiple viewings to fully understand.  But in typical Lost fashion, those who pay attention to details are rewarded.  Season 5 ends on a great note with ""The Incident"", which could possible change the fate of Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and all the other characters on the island.  This is must-see TV!As great as the Season 5 content is, I have several problems with the actual DVD package.  First of all, for those who own Seasons 1-4, you will notice a big difference in the box this time around.  Not a huge problem, but the inconsistent package looks weird sitting on a shelf next to the first four seasons.  Secondly, there is no booklet included with the episode summaries.  As a substitute, the episode titles are printed on the inside of the DVD case.  Perhaps the DHARMA Orientation Kit version is the better (although more expensive) way to goLost: The Complete Fifth Season Dharma Initiative Orientation Kit.  Bonus features also seem to be a bit light this time around.In conclusion, the extras and packaging of Season 5 is a bit disappointing.

Lost was always interesting (or at least when it occassionally ran off track it would JOLT you back into caring).  But once it started into the time-traveling, everything just started spiraling out of control.  Once you bring time travel in, then nothing matters any more.  Anything is possible and so everything becomes immediately uninteresting.There was really nothing I found very interesting or exciting about the entire season.  Nothing until Sayid shot young Ben.  I was shocked and entertained at that...for about 30 seconds...before I said to myself ""...wait, wait...he BETTER have actually died!""  Of course he didn't, even though, of all people, Sayid should have been able to stop that kid's heart from beating.  So even the one thing that could have been the ""Oh my god!"", season-making moment (think Locke being thrown out the building), didn't happen.  It was just smoke and mirrors.So much of the season was just time-traveling around randomly so we could have nostalgic looks down memory lane.  For example, Jin meeting a young Rousseau...for no reason, et.al.Then we've got the ridiculous, contrived relationship between Sawyer and Juliet.  Is ANYONE actually buying this?  Totally, totally lame.And now Locke is a reincarnated ancient god, who just killed another god.  Or not.  Or something.And oh my god!  Juliet just sacrificed herself!  Or maybe not.  So who cares any more.Who.  Cares.  I watched this show for 5 years under the assumption that there would be a huge pay-off at the end, justifying my investment in all the mysteries and so on.

I can't believe I have been hanging since May to find out what happens next.  The final season can't start soon enough for me.Of course, a compelling story would be nothing without good characters.  While Jack and Kate can get on my nerves at times, I still love watching Juliet.  And you can't help but love to hate Ben as he manipulates everyone into doing whatever he thinks is right.  Love them or hate them, the actors do an amazing job with their characters and the material they are given every week.  It's a joy to watch them work.I continue to have faith that this crazy journey really is leading somewhere.  Soon I'll find out if I was right or not.

As with the previous season, the set is massively overpriced given that its so few episodes. There are no physical extras at all. Not even a card listing episode titles. Its the classic fan expolitation release.There are two audio commentaries that were thrown together in a way that suggests they didn't want to do any audio commentaries at all. We are given a mock-1980s style documentary that might be interesting but for the fact that it has nothing new to say and nearly all of it was available on the web long beforethe set was even released. All of the more interesting extras from previous seasons are missing.And then there is ""Lost University"" which amounts to a conviluted online game designed to hide content (a bunch of commentary segments) already on the blu-ray.One positive thing was that the longer final episode of the season was not mangled or presented as two episodes this time.There are deleted scenes, bloopers, behind the scenes interviews and so on, but there is no interesting comment to be had.So why are the extras so bad? Because they took them all and created an even more expensive version (The Complete Fifth Season Dharma Initiative Orientation Kit). And because they care *so much* for the fans, they randomly put a futher exclusive extra in only some of the Dharma kit sets (the sub patch).The word for season five is *exploitation*.There is nothing worth rushing out to buy this for.

1163873,A4UM5DS14TSCO,B0019LY5IM,Matthew Warner,"[1, 2]","This just ain't the best show on television.I watch it for the occasional flashes of brilliance when something truly powerful happens between the characters -- like when Ben's daughter was shot, or when Kate and Sawyer finally did the dirty in the bear cage. I'm less appreciative of the Rubik's Cube nature of the story, of it being some type of puzzle to be solved. To enjoy a puzzle, one needs faith in the creators that there eventually will be a payoff, that things will make sense, that there is a master plan. I'm not all that convinced that a master plan exists in this show, or if one does, that it makes a whole hell of a lot of sense.Two things particularly irk me about this show:The first is the non-chronological nature of the storytelling. The show is loaded with flashbacks and flashforwards -- this on top of a story with time travel -- which interrupt the telling of the story. The story has become so confusing that they frequently have to have retrospective episodes where a narrator rehashes the events of the past season -- in a more or less chronological fashion -- just so you're not as lost as the characters. The plotting of LOST looks like a train track assembled by a dyslexic meth addict.Worse, the flashbacks are sometimes dropped in like Band-Aids whenever the writers need to give a character a motivation. For example, in Wednesday's episode, the writers needed to explain Juliette's inexplicable change of heart about whether to support Jack in his plan to detonate an H-bomb. So, out of nowhere, they show a flashback of her as a girl, learning that her parents are getting a divorce. Her parents said something like, ""Even if you love each other, it doesn't mean you're supposed to be together."" This memory of hers is then used to contrive her motivation for helping Jack, because she's suddenly decided she's not supposed to be together with Sawyer, and she repeats that line to Sawyer.The second thing that bugs me, as you've probably guessed, is the characters' frequent and unexplained changes of motivation. In that same scene where Juliette's support for Jack has suddenly changed, Kate's has also -- for no reason that I can tell other than that she's going along with the pack. Why, for instance, did Ben save Locke from suicide and then suddenly turn around and strangle him? In a subsequent episode, he vaguely gave a reason for this, but it didn't entirely make sense (nor could I have believed him if he did make sense because he's been well established as a compulsive liar). Jack is the worst character for motivations that shift in the wind. In the early seasons, getting off the island was all he wanted, and then later he's a drunken fool going around to his friends, yelling, ""We have to go back!"" -- a motivation supposedly brought about just because he's learned Locke has died. And then, once they're back on the island, he starts telling people, ""We don't belong here!""Well, thank God for the people at the Shocklines message board, who have insightfully theorized about some of the larger things of the show. The current theory is that Jacob and the other dude are two Egyptian gods who are using the islanders as pawns in their machinations against each other. One of them apparently has the ability to shape-shift -- perhaps into the Smoke Monster -- which, if true, explains a lot of things in retrospect. . . . But I ask you, is it right to wait so many seasons for anything to have a shred of sense?God, why am I watching this show?And . . . when does the next season begin?

The interwieving time travel story, where flashbacks involve differnt times, both forward and backwards is so heavy and intricate, the season begs to be rewatched.  The trouble is that a show like lost, which has been creating mysteries and plots for four years had to have a season this complex and confusing to provide the set up to the final season.  Much like in chess, a number of pieces must be put in place prior to check mate, season 5 sets up a number of stories and characters for its final season.  Through the complexity you find a well acted, and well driven story.  Sime revelations are made, some of which people have been guessing for some time, others which were completely unexpected.  All of this was brought together in one of the best cliffhangers I've seen on television.  When season 6 premieres, I'll be watching.As to the Blu Ray, the picture is gorgeous, especially the outdoor shots, with a pretty good smattering of special features, though I would have preferred a few more.  Sometimes when I watch special features on the Blu Ray/DVDs, I feel the cast, crew, and producers are holding back on information, just to not spoil things that are coming, and I especially felt that here, where the features didn't really give any insight into the future of the show, but was mostly retrospective.

This season more than any of the others can get confusing because of the time shifting.  After the six characters left the island at the end of season 4 we find that either the island or the people on it began shifting through time.  So in one episode you could be in the present, in 1954, 1977 or the late 1980s.  And you really have to pay attention to keep track of what is going on.Once the shifting stops most of the action occurs in 1977 and we see things like the creation of the hatch, learn more about the Dharma initiative as well as &#34;The Others.&#34;  We also lean about Ben and Widmore's conflict and see the beginning of it.  The season finale leaves us with a cliffhanger surrounding &#34;the incident&#34; which necessitated the pushing of the button every 108 min in season 3.  There are still a lot of questions, but this season definitely starts to fill in some of those gaps.As far as the discs go for those who get the blu rays.  There are a total of 5.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[10, 13]","It may not have been all that long ago that Lost had its share of ups and downs, but as the fourth season before it began to prove, the show is back on top.  Be warned now that some slight spoilers are ahead here.  The fifth, and penultimate, season of Lost begins with Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly), Sayid (Naveen Andrews), Hurley (Jorge Garcia), and Sun (Yunjin Kim) slowly realizing that they must return to the island with Ben (Michael Emerson) at the behest of the mysterious Eloise Hawking (Brotherhood's Fionnula Flanagan).  In the meantime back on the island, Sawyer (Josh Holloway), Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell), Faraday (Jeremy Davies), Miles (Ken Leung), and Charlotte (Rebecca Mader) find themselves, and the island itself, stuck traveling through time, which leads to some very interesting developments during the three years that Jack and co. are gone from the island.  We also witness just how Locke (Terry O'Quinn) wound up in that coffin in the first place, and how it ties into the return of the Oceanic Six to the island, as well as learn the fate of Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), and see what Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) has been up to.  Most notable however is that we finally learn more about the island's checkered past, from the huge foot of the missing statue to getting an understanding of the never-aging Richard Alpert's (Nestor Carbonell) actions to finally getting a glimpse of Jacob in the epic and shattering two part season finale that promises everything will change.  With everything that happens this season and how Lost now deals with time travel and the consequences it creates, you'd think things may end up convoluted and confusing, but surprisingly so, Lost manages to maintain a straightforward narrative that if you've been following the show for any amount of time at all, won't get thrown off or confused in the very least, which in itself is quite an accomplishment.  Yes, the end of Lost is upon us, and like past seasons before, many questions were answered, but in one huge flash of white light, even more were raised.  The end is indeed near, and while I certainly don't want to wait until 2010 to see how everything gets wrapped up, I have a feeling that the best is yet to come.",5,The best season of Lost yet,1242345600,"05 15, 2009",2009,2234,"['may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'long', 'Lost', 'had', 'share', 'ups', 'downs', 'fourth', 'season', 'began', 'prove', 'show', 'back', 'top', 'Be', 'warned', 'now', 'slight', 'spoilers', 'are', 'ahead', 'here', 'fifth', 'penultimate', 'season', 'Lost', 'begins', 'Jack', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'Kate', 'Evangeline', 'Lilly', 'Sayid', 'Naveen', 'Andrews', 'Hurley', 'Jorge', 'Garcia', 'Sun', 'Yunjin', 'Kim', 'slowly', 'realizing', 'must', 'return', 'island', 'Ben', 'Michael', 'Emerson', 'behest', 'mysterious', 'Eloise', 'Hawking', 'Brotherhood', 'Fionnula', 'Flanagan', 'meantime', 'back', 'island', 'Sawyer', 'Josh', 'Holloway', 'Juliet', 'Elizabeth', 'Mitchell', 'Faraday', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Miles', 'Ken', 'Leung', 'Charlotte', 'Rebecca', 'Mader', 'find', 'island', 'stuck', 'traveling', 'time', 'very', 'interesting', 'developments', 'three', 'years', 'Jack', 'co.', 'are', 'gone', 'island', 'also', 'witness', 'just', 'how', 'Locke', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'wound', 'up', 'coffin', 'first', 'place', 'how', 'return', 'Oceanic', 'Six', 'island', 'as', 'well', 'learn', 'fate', 'Jin', 'Daniel', 'Dae', 'Kim', 'see', 'what', 'Desmond', 'Henry', 'Ian', 'Cusick', 'been', 'up', 'Most', 'notable', 'however', 'finally', 'learn', 'more', 'island', 'checkered', 'past', 'huge', 'foot', 'missing', 'statue', 'getting', 'understanding', 'never-aging', 'Richard', 'Alpert', 'Nestor', 'Carbonell', 'actions', 'finally', 'getting', 'glimpse', 'Jacob', 'epic', 'shattering', 'two', 'part', 'season', 'finale', 'everything', 'will', 'change', 'everything', 'season', 'how', 'Lost', 'now', 'time', 'travel', 'consequences', ""'d"", 'think', 'things', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'convoluted', 'confusing', 'surprisingly', 'so', 'Lost', 'maintain', 'straightforward', 'narrative', ""'ve"", 'been', 'following', 'show', 'amount', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'thrown', 'off', 'confused', 'very', 'least', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'Yes', 'end', 'Lost', 'past', 'seasons', 'many', 'questions', 'were', 'answered', 'one', 'huge', 'flash', 'white', 'light', 'even', 'more', 'were', 'raised', 'end', 'indeed', 'near', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'wait', '2010', 'see', 'how', 'everything', 'wrapped', 'up', 'have', 'feeling', 'best', 'yet', 'come']",Lost: Season 5

Well I for one could not possibly disagree more. IMO season 5 was one of the best yet. Its the Season where Lost found its true self. Lets face it, Lost has always been a Sci Fi show, it was just set up in a way that made it more of a drama at times. This was how it was able to pull in so many viewers in the first couple of seasons as straight Sci Fi shows are never able to pull in those kinds of numbers. Well because of this dual role that Lost played, a lot of people simply forgot that Lost was in fact a Sci Fi show.This is why when Season 5 came along and the characters started jumping through time, a lot of people simply pulled away from the show as they didn't like the direction it was taking. Well for those of us that have understood from the beginning just what kind of show Lost really was, season 5 has easily been one of the best yet. Again this is the season where Lost found its true self, that of being a sci-fi show. In the Lost universe, time traveling is no more difficult to believe than anything we have seen on this show.The bottom line is that Lost has always been a Sci Fi show and it always will be. The people that have stopped watching Lost simply had a misconception about what this show really was. I for one love that the writers and producers have finally let Lost be the show that that it is. Its not a drama, its not a romantic comedy, its not a thriller, its not a comedy....its a Mystery/Sci Fi show and that is exactly what we got in Season 5.I am of course not really happy that they split the last season into 2 smaller seasons but what can you do. We are now approaching the start of the final season so its water under the bridge at this point.The bottom line - If you like the Sci-fi side of Lost then you should absolutely love season 5.

So many scenes that people might find useless, really have a connection to something that has already happened, or something that's going to happen.Trust me, this season more than any other, deserves a 2nd watch and you're probably going to connect everything correctly on your head, specially with the finale.And if after this season you still think that they don't know where they're going, that they make it up as they go along, then you still don't see the big picture in LOST, maybe you would need to watch it again.What I strongly advice, is that you finish watching the season, you take a deep breath, think about the episode, and watch it again, at least the begining of it, because I've had some friends that hated lost after the finale, but after I explained things over, they were completely amazed how they plan this show!But still, we have to wait for season 6 in 2010, that will be what will define this show as a complete masterpiece, or just a good entertaining show.We're all hoping for the first :)",5,Simply Amazing,1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,1624,"['season', 'was', 'truly', 'amazing.The', 'season', 'finale', 'was', 'something', 'completely', 'perspective', 'show', 'better', 'picture', 'what', 'going', ""'re"", 'left', 'question', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'more', 'ever.We', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'could', 'rate', 'less', '3', 'stars', 'know', 'just', 'point', 'view', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'watch', 'again', 'one', 'bad', 'things', 'LOST', 'Something', 'love', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'episodes', 'only', 'once', 'simply', 'have', 'bad', 'memory', 'be', 'lost', 'go', 'back', 'previous', 'episodes', 'So', 'many', 'scenes', 'people', 'might', 'find', 'useless', 'really', 'have', 'connection', 'something', 'already', 'happened', 'something', 'going', 'happen.Trust', 'season', 'more', 'other', '2nd', 'watch', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'connect', 'everything', 'correctly', 'head', 'specially', 'finale.And', 'season', 'still', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'up', 'go', 'along', 'then', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'big', 'picture', 'LOST', 'maybe', 'would', 'need', 'watch', 'strongly', 'advice', 'finish', 'watching', 'season', 'take', 'deep', 'breath', 'think', 'episode', 'watch', 'again', 'least', 'begining', ""'ve"", 'had', 'friends', 'hated', 'lost', 'finale', 'explained', 'things', 'were', 'completely', 'amazed', 'how', 'plan', 'show', 'still', 'have', 'wait', 'season', '6', '2010', 'will', 'be', 'what', 'will', 'define', 'show', 'complete', 'masterpiece', 'just', 'good', 'entertaining', 'show.We', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'first']",Lost: Season 5

1163895,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0019LY5IM,Robert Moore,"[24, 34]","Season Five of LOST was the first that provided more answers than questions. The first four seasons had raised questions at an extraordinary pace, providing the occasional answer. But while the end of Season Five raised a couple of massive questions of huge cliffhanger proportions, we nonetheless got more of a sense of what is going on with the island, its inhabitants, and its visitors than ever before. There are still some major unanswered questions, like the origin of the island and what the deal with Richard Alpert (the ageless wonder) is and who built the statue (and what brought it down), but we still are getting an overall picture of things.What held true of LOST after Season One holds true of the show after Season Five: whether this turns out to be a great show depends on how well they manage to wrap up the overall story line. There have been very, very few shows in the history of television that have set out, from the very beginning, to tell a self-contained story with a beginning, middle, and an end. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (the new one, not the old one) was one. BABYLON 5 was another. Many other shows have more or less ended up telling a story, but in a way that wasn't crucial to the structure of the series. This was even true of a show like ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT. But for shows like LOST and BSG, our ultimate judgment will hinge on how well all the loose ends are wrapped up at the end. The final answers will have a retroactive effect on the rest of the series. If we are left at the end feeling that the secrets of the island have not been adequately answered, this will undercut all that went before. If we don't accept the way the stories of the characters are resolved, it will weaken the series as a whole. I loved the way that BSG ended (though I'll grant that not everyone did) and I fully hope that LOST will end similarly well. We've gotten five great seasons and I doubt that Damon Lindelhof and Carlton Cuse will suddenly lose their ability to tell a great story. Plus, they will continue to be assisted by some great writers like Drew Goddard and Elizabeth Sarnoff and Brian K. Vaughan (who got a great shout out this season when Hurley is seen reading in Spanish one of the volumes of Y: THE LAST MAN, the famous graphic series written by Vaughan).Season Five began with the survivors of Oceanic 815 and their various allies split into two groups. The Oceanic Six are back in the real world, but Jack and Ben are determined to lead them all back to the island. The rest back on the island - at least those that are still alive, most having died - have, like Billy Pilgrim in Kurt Vonnegut's SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE, become unstuck in time. They find themselves moving from one year or decade - heck, from one century - to another. And when the Oceanic Six return, they find themselves stranded in a different time themselves, back in the seventies with the Dharma Initiative and the Others. Most poignantly, Sun has found out that Jin is till alive, but they are stuck thirty years apart.But this wouldn't be LOST without a host of twists and turns. We are barraged (in a good way) with a never-ending string of shocks and surprises. Things constantly turn out not to be what we expect. That is especially true of John Locke, but true of just about everyone else as well. The amount of detail is almost overwhelming, though in a good way. It keeps the show fascinating and ever fresh. And of course, this being LOST, there are a host of deaths. The only series with a larger body count is BSG.The best thing about Season Five of LOST is that it continues the excellent pacing that was established after the Season Three hiatus. I'm sure everyone will recall that fans were outraged and disappointed after the first six episodes of Season Three, which were broadcast a few months before the show resumed in the winter. Fans felt that the show was dragging, as if they were trying to stretch the series out an extra season or two instead of getting on with the story. When the show resumed, the producers responded to the fans' complaints and significantly stepped up the pace of the storytelling. By the end of that season it felt like a new and completely refreshed show. And Seasons Four and Five have maintained that pace. One thing that definitely helped them maintain the pace was the announcement at the end of Season three that the show would end after Season Six.And so we come to the beginning of the end. For five seasons LOST has been one of the most intense, involving shows on television. I'm already starting to get sad about its end. I still haven't quite recovered from BATTLESTAR GALACTICA ending this spring and now LOST ends next spring. It has been a great story from the very beginning and we can only hope that things remain just as good as they have been.",5,In Season Five we get more answers than questions as LOST remains utterly

If you watched season one and two, you'll remember the six week breaks, then in season two ABC decides to start showing the Tail section 2 weeks into the 6 week break???My point: I love the series LOST, I watch it over and over.

The show over the past couple of seasons had been revealing itself as the sci-fi/fantasy show that it is and here in season five we deal with time travel. Doesn't get much more sci-fi than that.There are a lot of twists along the way and there were episodes that I marveled at how the writers manage to bring so many elements together so perfectly and satisfyingly. They've always been good at this but the fact that they maintained it with the addition of time travel is a bit of a miracle. I also applaud them for bringing themes back that they set up early on in season one at the end of this season. In fact, there's lots of things from the past couple of seasons that are answered at the end of this season. If the writers didn't have a plan for this series from the beginning, they've done a hell of a job tying it together.If there is a slight failing of season five, its that the show was somewhat less character centered than the previous seasons. A lot of this is due to the change in storytelling in season five. Gone are the character-centric flashbacks/flashforwards. When the show flashes, it's flashing back/forward in time. Still, some characters like Locke and especially Sawyer are given a lot to do and have interesting arcs this season. But for the most part, a lot of the old favorites are in a holding pattern. For example, what does Sun do in this season? Jack in particular is passive and almost unlikable for most of the season. There's also a fair bit of story/character motivations that hang on Jack and Sawyer being in love with Kate, and that didn't work for me. It seemed a bit lazy and unearned. The good news is that the dudes behind the show, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, have been saying in interviews that season six is going to be a lot like season one (whatever the hell that really means) and very character centric. I hope they're true to their word.I'll end by saying the finale aired seven months ago, and my mind is still blown. I have no idea where it goes from here, and I think that's great. How many shows are this unpredictable after five seasons? I cant think of one. I'm excited for season six, but I am going to mourn the end of this show for a long time.

There are so many pieces now, though, that the story is very complex, on a par with ""Twin Peaks"", so it does not lend itself to casual viewing. In fact, as I watched I felt as though I should be taking notes. I never did, but I paid very close attention. The science fiction elements are front and center in this season, and a lot of fun. The characters also have a lot to do and a lot of difficult choices to make, so it's great to watch them.

Some may be confused with the whole time travel plot line, but I think it will all come together beautifully in the final season and it will all make perfect sense. Or I hope anyway. Up till now, we have been getting more questions than answers and perhaps Season 5 is the weirdest of them all, but I thoroughly loved each and every episode. It has alot to offer. Though some characters were underutilized, others who have more screentime certainly benefit from it. We have a predictable romance, yes, but it also somehow feels genuine and when the tention mounts, you really feel it. There are alliances, and backstabbing, people that miraculously rise from the dead(or do they?) and of course, the mysterious Jacob is finally revealed. Or so we think. I suppose it can get frustrated at times, but I always ended up craving more after the end of each episode. That should be the purpose of any show and this succeeds on every level. The season ends in a cliffhanger that is impossible to ponder over or it will drive you crazy.

I love time travel stuff, but to be honest with you I was skeptical at first when they announced that the season would deal heavily in time travel. They had touched on time travelling style issues in previous seasons, with Desmond, but actual, physical time travel seemed like a major shark jump.Well, luckily they handled it in a way that only LOST could, and the result is incredibly interesting, and even works its way into fold of Lost mythology without a hitch. Three episodes in particular are among my all time favorites of the series...THE JUGHEAD- in which the gang goes back to 1954 and meet seventeen year old Ellie, a super cute vixen with a super cute (but b*tchy) face.HES OUR YOU- a fantastic mind trip involving Sayid getting revenge on Ben thirty years in the past and..FOLLOW THE LEADER- the peak of time travel madness and smoke monster antics rolled together in one and featuring a now forty year old Eloise Hawking who is super hot and could put handcuffs on me anyday.

1163929,AP3B615GM191G,B0019LY5IM,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[31, 38]","While watching the first four seasons of LOST, I was continually amazed at the show's ability (due to its incredible writing) to keep the material fresh.  Whether it was the flashbacks of season one, the Hatch in season two, or the huge bombshells dropped at the ends of seasons three and four, LOST was always able to keep me guessing and never felt as if it were treading the same ground twice.This fifth season is no exception, and one could even make the case that this is the ""strangest"" season of LOST to date.  Gone is the relatively linear format of the previous four seasons, and in is a storytelling format that jumps across time as easily as the Starship Enterprise!  There are really three main ""plot schemes"" that exist during the course of the season (warning: minor spoilers ahead):First, the question of ""what the heck happened to the island?!"" is answered, as the island (and all on it) are skipping through time and must find a way to reverse the effect before their nervous systems suffer the consequences of being displaced in time.Once the time-skipping is stopped, the islanders find themselves in vastly different time periods, which allows the writers (in perhaps the most brilliant move in series history) to actually SHOW the Dharma Initiative, not just explain it.While all of that is going on, the ""Oceanic Six"" are dealing with problems of their own (""We have to go back, Kate!"") and each one must make their own decision about returning to the island.All those thought-provoking topics provided hours more entertainment the likes of which has never been seen on network TV.  Yet, I actually consider this to be the fifth-ranked season of the show for a couple of reasons:-A few episodes bogging down and not advancing the plot as much as in the past.  Though it is interesting to see some of the ""Losties"" initiate themselves into the Dharma group, a bit too much is made of them just ""being there"" and the plot stagnates a bit.  The same thing happens with the ""Oceanic Six"" storyline...some parts are interesting, but I just breathed a sigh of relief when ""they"" (I won't say who or how) get back to the island.-Also, I really missed the use of flashbacks.  Though the writers are still able to tell interesting stories without them, for the first three (and the flash-forwards for one) seasons I considered the ""flashes"" to be the emotional backbone of the show, as it was how we really became acquainted with all the characters.  I realize that the ""flashes"" had probably run their course, but (selfishly) I still missed them all the same.So, had I been able to give this season a ""4.5 star"" rating, I probably would have.  But, two factors made me lean to the side of five stars: The incredible finale episode (which I consider to be the most riveting two hours of television I have ever watched in my life...I literally walked around in a stupor for about an hour afterwards in shock) and the ""John Locke/Ben Linus"" plot thread.  Only the LOST writers could show Locke in a coffin and then have him play a larger role in the next season than he did in the previous one!To conclude, though certain trivial details (few flashbacks, a couple ""draggy"" episodes) may not put this on top of your ""favorite LOST season"" list, it is still (by quite a large margin) the greatest show on TV today (and perhaps ever).
