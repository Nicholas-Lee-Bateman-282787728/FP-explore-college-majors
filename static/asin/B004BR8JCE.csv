That might be true if Sun Yat-sen were only revered by the Mainland Chinese.  He's also revered by Taiwan.  This movie gives a great perspective of the Chinese revolution.  How inspiring people to believe in a cause makes them absolutely fearless!  It doesn't matter where the person is from, the concept of dying for one's country, friends and family can make even 17 year-old boys brave enough to stand their ground (in this case it meant not fighting at all, simply having the courage to be - I won't say any more than that so readers can enjoy the story.)Anyway, whether you are interested in this movie for the &#34;kicks&#34; or the historicity, it is well worth the 2 + hours invested!!",5,Gives fresh insight to the Chinese revolution,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,753,"['have', 'said', 'just', 'more', 'communist', 'propaganda', 'might', 'be', 'true', 'Sun', 'Yat-sen', 'were', 'only', 'revered', 'Mainland', 'Chinese', 'also', 'revered', 'Taiwan', 'movie', 'great', 'perspective', 'Chinese', 'revolution', 'How', 'inspiring', 'people', 'believe', 'cause', 'absolutely', 'fearless', ""n't"", 'matter', 'where', 'person', 'concept', 'dying', 'one', 'country', 'friends', 'family', 'can', 'make', 'even', '17', 'year-old', 'boys', 'brave', 'enough', 'stand', 'ground', 'case', 'meant', 'not', 'fighting', 'simply', 'having', 'courage', 'be', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'readers', 'can', 'enjoy', 'story', 'Anyway', 'are', 'interested', 'movie', '34', 'kicks', '34', 'historicity', 'well', '2', '+', 'hours', 'invested']",N/A

1395601,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004BR8JCE,C. Sawin,"[36, 44]","Whenever I find myself getting lost in conversations with other people about martial arts films one of the guys that always seems to get glossed over is Donnie Yen. He's just as good as the Bruce Lees, the Jackie Chans, the Jet Lis, and Tony Jaas out there, but for some reason he's just never really been able to click with the mainstream. Yen seemed to stick around wuxia films longer than the names you probably associate with these types of movies and extravagant wirework is usually the first thing to make an action film feel mediocre to me. People can't fly around, run on the tips of blades of grass, or kick people seventeen times in the air before landing on their feet and doing it all over again; the more realistic an action film is the more enjoyable it is to me. But ever since Hero (yes it's a wuxia film, but it's one of the exceptions), Donnie Yen has put out some really fantastic action films that are either more grounded or the wirework involved is a lot more subtle. Kill Zone and Flash Point were two of the films that made me love the guy's work and Ip Man is easily one of my favorite martial arts films of all time. Most Yen projects not only have spectacular action sequences, but have an engaging story to tell as well and that's something action films like this usually don't bother trying to do. Bodyguards and Assassins just tends to focus more on the dramatic side of things rather than just punch you in the face, kick you in the gut, and move on to the next action scene.Bodyguards and Assassins is a bit misleading. It's marketed as this martial arts epic and it really isn't. It's actually incredibly similar to 13 Assassins in the way that nearly all of the action is in the last hour of the movie. Most of the movie is spent planning Sun Wen's arrival. The movie takes place during the early 1900s when plans were set into motion to try and overthrow the Qing Dynasty which had become corrupt. Sun Wen was the man believed to be the revolutionary and first step toward that goal. So while many Chinese are willing to step up to the cause and see China become a democracy, there are others who want China to remain the way it is; some want to protect him while many want to kill him. This movie is even more of a slow burn than 13 Assassins was. A man gets shot in the opening scene, there's a brief fight scene where more characters get killed, but the rest of the first hour of the film is very dialogue heavy that is sure to make action junkies itch for their fix.The other misleading part of the film is Donnie Yen getting top billing. He does play a key supporting role, but is probably only around on-screen for thirty to forty minutes. His character is probably the most well-developed though. Yen is Sum Chang-Yang; a compulsive gambler who will do anything for money. His wife left him after their daughter was born because she didn't want to see their child have the same fate as her father. He's basically a lowlife the entire movie until he has the opportunity to make something of himself and finally gets to see his daughter up close. Then it's as if his entire life was spent waiting for this moment and he decides he shouldn't waste it. So while Yen does make the most of his screen time, he's secondary to the bigger issue at hand.Bodyguards and Assassins falls victim to shaky camera techniques during a good portion of the fight scenes. The technique is probably used to make the viewer feel closer to the action, but it just doesn't work. It makes you miss more of the action rather than make you feel like you're a part of it. The other disappointment is that there is quite a lot of CG blood in the movie. Most of the blood that makes it to the ground is obviously made with practical effects, but all of it that flies into the air is computer generated. CG blood just gives a movie like this a cartoonish feel, when it's supposed to be taken seriously.The last hour does have at least two scenes to try and make up for that wordy first hour. There's a chase scene that evolves into a fight scene involving Donnie Yen in the marketplace that is exactly what you've been craving since the movie began. It's probably Yen's crowning achievement in the movie. Leon Lai plays a beggar in the film named Liu Yubai who was outcast from his rich family after falling in love with his father's woman. He uses a metal fan when he fights and he's extremely skilled with it. His action scene is quite spectacular as well and it nearly trumps Yen's.Bodyguards and Assassins is not a bad film by any means; it's very story driven, has an excellent cast, and delivers an incredibly powerful message. But labeling it solely as an action film seems really unfair. It's a historical drama featuring some action sequences. Impatient viewers may turn the film off before it really has the chance to take off while a shaky camera and CG blood does bring the movie down a notch or two, but there is light at the end of that tunnel for martial arts admirers. Donnie Yen fans may also be slightly disappointed once they realize Yen only has a supporting role. Nevertheless Bodyguards and Assassins is a riveting drama with an unbelievable climax that captures the look and feel of Hong Kong during the early 1900s in exquisite fashion.The special features on the DVD are kind of weird, so bear with me. First up are five Making of featurettes. ""The Characters"" is about twenty one minutes long and gives a brief look at the characters The Revolutionary, The Tycoon, The Diva, The Fugitive, The Rickshawman, The Fiancee, The Heir, The Hawker, The Policeman, The Beggar, The Assassin, The Concubine, and The Gambler. Each actor and cast member bleeds not only enthusiasm for the project but passion, as well. You're treated to quite a bit of interesting information during this feature including the fact that the film was nearly ten years in the making. During The Gambler portion of the feature, you get an in-depth look at Donnie Yen's astounding marketplace fight scene that's a great watch. ""The Set"" is nearly three minutes long. The set was built from the ground up and took six months to build. It portrays Hong Kong during the early 1900s very realistically. ""The Design"" is just under two minutes long. It goes into detail concerning the extent of the costume designs including the police uniforms. Leon Lai also discusses how he crushed up bean curd with honey and smothered himself with it to try and be more in character. ""The Make-Up"" is a minute and a half long. We take a look at Nicholas Tse, Hu Jun, and Donnie Yen as they each tell their stories of sitting in the make up chair during production. Donnie Yen spent four hours putting on make-up and one hour taking it off every day. Hu Jun had prosthetics added to his forehead and nose to make his nose crooked. ""The Action"" is about four and a half minutes long. It briefly takes a look at the action director using storyboards for most of the action sequences before the feature recycles the same behind the scenes marketplace fight footage from ""The Characters"" featurette.There are also four extended interviews totaling a little over ten minutes in length altogether. Leon Lai goes into detail about his beggar character while telling the story about he became part of the production. We're also shown behind the scenes footage of his action sequence being shot. Wang Xueqi portrayed Li Yu-Tang and discusses his first time working with a Taiwanese and Hong Kong cast. Tony Ka-Fai Leung played Chen Xiao-Bai and talks about portraying a revolutionary pushing 30 years old when he's well over 30 himself. Finally there's the producer Peter Chan who created the concept of the film ten years ago when the movie market was very different and wouldn't have been mature enough for a film like this. The DVD also contains the international trailer, as well.The funky part comes in the form of a QR code on the DVD. You scan it with your android phone and it takes you to a website that's supposed to feature more bonus material. There's a mailing list you can sign up for that supposedly mails you a clue leading to a new reward in the form of bonus material. The only video on the site at the moment is Tony Ka-Fai Leung's two minute extended interview.The Bodyguards and Assassins DVD is not rated, but is presented in Mandarin with English subtitles, is available in 5.1 Dolby Digital and English Stereo sound, and is presented in widescreen. It is approximately 139 minutes long and should be available in both retail stores and most online retailers now.",3,"Spectacular cast and atmosphere, action is kind of secondary",1312070400,"07 31,

1395604,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004BR8JCE,DVD Verdict,"[12, 15]","Judge Josh Rode, DVD Verdict -- ""What we get for the first half is an expose of a man who tries to straddle an increasingly pointed fence between his corrupt government and his conscience. The film sets up the showdown between these ""bodyguards"" and the Qing assassins. While this does build a feeling of tension, there is generally very little action in these early scenes. Although that's not necessarily bad. We get some very good acting, major character development (when's the last time you could say that about a martial arts film?), and backstories on the major players which range from interesting to just kinda stupid. When the payoff finally comes, it does so with a vengeance. Each of the bodyguards gets his (or her) moment to shine, which is great because it makes every one of them pivotal to the film. The best battle of the movie (and possibly the best I've ever seen), between Yen and American MMA champion Cung Le (Tekken), is not the climax, which seems odd for a martial arts film but fits the ""this isn't really a true kung fu movie"" direction of this one to a T. The 2.35:1 transfer is clean with a clear picture even in the darker scenes. The 5.1 Mandarin track is strong, but if you're a fan of dubbing (this film has the best lip-synchronization I've seen in a long time) you'll be stuck with a Dolby 2.0 stereo track. The extras are repetitive, using the same interview quotes and scene clips throughout the behind-the-scenes featurettes. The most interesting parts are about the Hong Kong circa 1906 set that they built exclusively for this movie. It is absolutely astounding and I wish they had gone into more detail about it. Bodyguards and Assassins is a step up from your normal kung fu/martial arts film. It builds actual characters we care about and has a reasonably complex and engaging plot. That, combined with the extended race-and-chase interspersed with great fighting to finish the film, makes it all worth it in the end.""",4,What's with assassin movies waiting until the film is half over before turning on the action?,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,1962,"['Judge', 'Josh', 'Rode', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'What', 'get', 'first', 'half', 'expose', 'man', 'who', 'straddle', 'increasingly', 'pointed', 'fence', 'corrupt', 'government', 'conscience', 'film', 'up', 'showdown', 'bodyguards', 'Qing', 'assassins', 'build', 'feeling', 'tension', 'generally', 'very', 'little', 'action', 'early', 'scenes', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'get', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'major', 'character', 'development', 'when', 'last', 'time', 'could', 'say', 'about', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'backstories', 'major', 'players', 'range', 'interesting', 'just', 'kinda', 'stupid', 'When', 'payoff', 'finally', 'so', 'vengeance', 'bodyguards', 'moment', 'shine', 'great', 'one', 'pivotal', 'film', 'best', 'battle', 'movie', 'possibly', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Yen', 'American', 'MMA', 'champion', 'Cung', 'Le', 'Tekken', 'not', 'climax', 'odd', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'true', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'direction', 'one', 'T.', '2.35:1', 'transfer', 'clean', 'clear', 'picture', 'even', 'darker', 'scenes', '5.1', 'Mandarin', 'track', 'strong', ""'re"", 'fan', 'dubbing', 'film', 'best', 'lip-synchronization', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', ""'ll"", 'be', 'stuck', 'Dolby', '2.0', 'stereo', 'track', 'extras', 'are', 'repetitive', 'using', 'same', 'interview', 'quotes', 'scene', 'clips', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'are', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'circa', '1906', 'set', 'built', 'exclusively', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'astounding', 'wish', 'had', 'gone', 'more', 'detail', 'Bodyguards', 'Assassins', 'step', 'up', 'normal', 'kung', 'fu/martial', 'arts', 'film', 'actual', 'characters', 'care', 'reasonably', 'complex', 'engaging', 'plot', 'combined', 'extended', 'race-and-chase', 'interspersed', 'great', 'fighting', 'finish', 'film', 'end']",N/A

1395622,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004BR8JCE,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","""Bodyguards and Assassins"" is an ambitious movie attempting to be two things at once. While with its all-star ensemble cast and a gorgeous set, the film tries to be an emotionally-charged, character-driven drama, it also strives to satisfy the action-flick fans providing martial arts action sequences. The end result is a mixed bag, a deeply flawed film that is still worth checking out for the stars' names and their fine acting as well as some effective action scenes.Set in 1905, ""Bodyguards and Assassins"" follows the story of a group of bodyguards (mostly ordinary citizens) rallied to protect Sun Wen, a Chinese revolutionary and political leader who will arrive in Hong Kong for a secret meeting with other revolutionaries in a few days. But the China's Qing Dynasty also knows the plans and sends out assassins to murder Sun Wen.The film's earlier part (more than one hour) is devoted to introducing the backgrounds of characters and building up the dramatic tension by focusing their conflicts. Acting is all top-notch. I was most impressed with Tony Leung Ka-fai playing a newspaper editor Chen Shaobai and Wang Xueqi as his financial backer (and old friend) Li Yutang. Nicholas Tse as a rickshaw driver is also memorable. A gambling-addicted police officer Shen Chongyang (Donnie Yen) in the pay of the dynasty is also very good.But for all the effective acting the ""Bodyguards and Assassins"" is far from perfect. The film's weakness lies in the screenplay, which fails to convince us the characters' motives to sacrifice everything for Sun Wen. Yes, I know, Sun Wen is a political leader who plays an important role in the modern history of China (as seen in a recent film ""1911""), but historical knowledge is not enough for us to relate to them especially when here Sun Wen as a character is hardly fleshed out.But more serious problem is that the bodyguards' plans to protect the convoy are vague at best. We are told the bodyguards must protect Sun Wen no matter what it costs, but we don't know much about how they intend to achieve that. As a consequence the latter half of the film looks as if the story doesn't know where it is going. There are several nice action set-pieces (Donnie Yen and Leon Lai are standout), but somehow they lack thrills and excitement because we know how their battles would end anyway.To call ""Bodyguards and Assassins"" an action movie is misleading. Though it contains action, the movie is also about the dramas of the people. That is not a bad idea, but perhaps the film could have been better with a bit more emphasis on either the former aspect or the latter.",3,Hong Kong Action Flick?

1395625,A3NQU2F7ZYCQGK,B004BR8JCE,William Bolton,"[27, 32]","This is a great movie. It has a good pseudo-historical story about Sun Yat-Sen visiting Hong Kong in 1906 to plan a revolution against the empress and the government of China. The empress when she learns of the visit dispatches a small army of ninjas to assassinate him. The first hour of the film introduces the location, the very diverse characters and the story. The second hour is non-stop action as Sun arrives, the ninjas and their fearsome leader attempt to kill him, and the motley group of characters we've been introduced to attempt to thwart them and save Sun. There's a lot of heroism and loyalty on display here, and some unforgettable fight scenes. The one that pits Donnie Yen against the ninja champion is probably the most thrilling because he has the skills but the others are powerful,too. In every respect this movie is exceptional, the direction, the acting, the cinematography, the set creation, and the scoring. It's a classic.",5,An Epic Film,1266883200,"02 23, 2010",2010,950,"['great', 'movie', 'good', 'pseudo-historical', 'story', 'Sun', 'Yat-Sen', 'visiting', 'Hong', 'Kong', '1906', 'plan', 'revolution', 'empress', 'government', 'China', 'empress', 'when', 'visit', 'small', 'army', 'ninjas', 'assassinate', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'location', 'very', 'diverse', 'characters', 'story', 'second', 'hour', 'non-stop', 'action', 'Sun', 'ninjas', 'fearsome', 'leader', 'attempt', 'kill', 'motley', 'group', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'been', 'introduced', 'attempt', 'thwart', 'save', 'Sun', 'lot', 'heroism', 'loyalty', 'display', 'here', 'unforgettable', 'fight', 'scenes', 'one', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'ninja', 'champion', 'probably', 'most', 'thrilling', 'skills', 'others', 'are', 'powerful', 'too', 'respect', 'movie', 'exceptional', 'direction', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'set', 'creation', 'scoring', 'classic']",N/A
