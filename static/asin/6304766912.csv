When viewed with special prism glasses (two came with the video), the television screen is transformed into a kaleidoscope....one colorful vision after another! I found that when you tilt your head, the TV image stands out even more and you get 3-D- like images in the background. All this is accompanied by psychedelic-type instrumental music, kind of mellow Jerry Garcia sounds and slower ""trance music"" of today.The problem I found was that after 10-20 minutes, that's enough. As colorful as it is, it gets routine after awhile. Of course, I never tried this under any influence of anything and perhaps that's the secret to staying with it longer. In my younger days, I probably would have loved this.In the last five minutes, the kaleidoscope images switched to just those of colorful balls. Wow, I wonder if this film was made for ""stoners?""Ya think??",4,Now This Is Definitely Something Different!,1235088000,"02 20, 2009",2009,960,"['be', 'most', 'unique', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'owned.I', 'got', 'back', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'VHS', 'When', 'viewed', 'special', 'prism', 'glasses', 'two', 'came', 'video', 'television', 'screen', 'transformed', 'kaleidoscope', '.one', 'colorful', 'vision', 'found', 'when', 'tilt', 'head', 'TV', 'image', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'get', '3-D-', 'images', 'background', 'accompanied', 'psychedelic-type', 'instrumental', 'music', 'kind', 'mellow', 'Jerry', 'Garcia', 'slower', 'trance', 'music', 'today.The', 'problem', 'found', 'was', '10-20', 'minutes', 'enough', 'As', 'colorful', 'routine', 'awhile', 'course', 'never', 'tried', 'influence', 'anything', 'perhaps', 'secret', 'staying', 'longer', 'younger', 'days', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'this.In', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'kaleidoscope', 'switched', 'just', 'colorful', 'balls', 'Wow', 'wonder', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'stoners', 'Ya', 'think']",N/A

This is all abstract, no defined pattern to it, all abstract.  One thing that annoyed me a little is that after a while, the pattern stayed the same.  It was all based in circles, triangles, squares &amp; dots, that were all based in the CENTER of the screen, and from there each angle would split and form the same figure in all 4 corners of the screen.That is not a defect, I just found it to be very uniform.  Another thing, is that the 3D glasses DO ADD an effect to viewing this DVD.  Without the glasses you will NOT experience the effect as it was meant to be.I give it 4 stars because I found the pattern to be rather repetitive, but still I highly recommend it to anyone.Turn off the lights, turn on your music (if you don't like the one in the DVD, which is not so great btw), and enjoy.I had fun.  I just gave you a few tips on how to watch it.The rest, is up to your imagination.",4,Incredible graphics that will astonish your mind.,1046131200,"02 25, 2003",2003,1213,"['bought', 'DVD', 'watching', 'quot', 'Oddysey', 'Into', 'Mind', 'Eye', 'quot', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'title', 'quot', 'Headcandy', 'quot', 'was', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'DVD.Even', 'was', 'totally', 'different', 'still', 'mind-blowing', 'DVD', 'must', 'be', 'watched', 'abstract', 'defined', 'pattern', 'abstract', 'One', 'thing', 'annoyed', 'little', 'while', 'pattern', 'stayed', 'same', 'was', 'based', 'circles', 'triangles', 'squares', 'amp', 'dots', 'were', 'based', 'CENTER', 'screen', 'there', 'angle', 'would', 'split', 'form', 'same', 'figure', '4', 'corners', 'screen.That', 'not', 'defect', 'just', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'uniform', 'thing', '3D', 'glasses', 'DO', 'ADD', 'effect', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'glasses', 'will', 'NOT', 'experience', 'effect', 'was', 'meant', 'be.I', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'found', 'pattern', 'be', 'rather', 'repetitive', 'still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone.Turn', 'off', 'lights', 'turn', 'music', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'DVD', 'not', 'so', 'great', 'btw', 'enjoy.I', 'had', 'fun', 'just', 'gave', 'few', 'tips', 'how', 'watch', 'it.The', 'rest', 'imagination']",N/A
