753661,A14DW744E54DHP,B00009EIRU,C. Bender,"[9, 10]","At first, the set-up for Twelve Kingdoms is very similar to Fushigi Yuugi: A rather annoying whiny schoolgirl and her friend get sucked into another world similar to ancient China, can't get back home, get separated and have a feud and have lots of adventures. But fortunately for us, the resemblance ends there.While Fushigi Yuugi's charm is fueled by the characters' relationships, the Twelve Kingdoms is far more layered and focuses more on individual character development. The main character Youko Nakajima develops from a very insecure and self concious high school girl to an introspective and self-aware young monarch of the Kingdom of Kei.I admit that Youko's initial whiny and weepy personality was very annoying to watch. And there is some violence and depictions of cruelty, so this series is not meant for the younger ""Pokemon"" audience.But the payoff for watching this beautifully drawn and splendidly imagined series is enormous. Twelve Kingdoms is a complex, deeply layered fantasy world whose scope rivals that of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. The soundtrack is beautiful and the introductory music is unforgetable. The best thing about this anime are the life lessons it teaches. The characters learn that despite terrible adversity, one should never give up!Twelve Kingdoms is definitely my all time favorite anime! So to all anime fans out there, I'll use a line often used at the end of the episodes, ""You won't want to miss it!""",5,Amazing Epic Fantasy Series!!

That said, I received a DVD sampler from Media Blasters with my new issue of Newtype USA and a partial preview of the first episode was on it. From what I have seen this looks like a high quality series with great animation and an intriguing story. It will be probably a year or 2 before I buy it but I have plenty of anime to hold me over till then.

What I will say is, I love this first volume because it draws you in by combining excellent writing with very good pacing (unlike a lot of other ""adventure anime"" which compensates for lack of plot by racing through what plot there is).

753665,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B00009EIRU,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[11, 17]","On first appearances this new series appears to be a more or less typical 'magical girl' clone.  Youko Nakajima is a young student who comes from a strict, traditional family, where her red hair is looked on with dismay.  In fact, she is ordered to dye it black to that it won't look like she dyed it red.  Her friend Yuka Sugimoto is an alienated unhappy woman.  Both are friends and competitors for the affection of Ikuya Asano.  All of these teenagers are a bit too hapless for my tastes.Suddenly Youko is attacked by mythical beasts at her high school, and Keiki, a spirit rescues her.  He is maneuvered into bring along her two friends.  Youka, who desperately wants to fit in and be normal, is devastated by this sudden incursion into her life.  Catapulted into a strange unknown land, she is more worried about what her parents will think than the nitty-gritty of her survival in a hostile world.  A place where strangers such as herself are labelled Kaikyaku and blamed for a series of natural and social disasters.When Keiki disappears, Youka, who is supposedly a chosen princess given a magical sword, makes a total mess of everything in which she gets involved.  Her weeping and moans so irritate her friends that Yuka finally decides that some mistake has been made and that she is really the chosen princess.  If it weren't for the fact that Yuka is every bit as nasty as Youka is hapless, the viewer would probably agree with her.  In any case, the dramatic circumstances of being uprooted to a magical land where spirits serve fortunate residents (just as they do in Final Fantasy) take place against a backdrop that plays out a complex of dysfunctional personality traits.So far the story is showing all signs of being a coming of age story where Youko, whose personality has been totally suppressed by her parents and scholl either develops something that resembles self-definition of dies trying.  Hopefully, the plot will avoid being that quite that predictable, but the producers and writers have been in a great hurry to set up that scenario and develop Youko and Yuka into antagonists.  Artistically, it is an attractively done series, set in a land which more resembles China than Japan (we are assured that it definitely isn't China).On the whole, I can't get completely excited about this series yet.  Although the artwork and music are good, the acting is stiff and the characters not particularily sympathetic.  Perhaps this will shake out in the end, but right not I would recommend a wait and see attitude.  Two technical issues.  I had repeated problems with this DVD in my player.  One which has so far been completely reliable.  In addition, either the original DVD or the Anime Works remaking left the focus a bit too soft.",3,A Wobbly Start,1066089600,"10 14, 2003",2003,2756,"['first', 'appearances', 'new', 'series', 'be', 'more', 'less', 'typical', ""'magical"", 'girl', 'clone', 'Youko', 'Nakajima', 'young', 'student', 'who', 'strict', 'traditional', 'family', 'where', 'red', 'hair', 'looked', 'dismay', 'fact', 'ordered', 'dye', 'black', 'wo', ""n't"", 'look', 'dyed', 'red', 'friend', 'Yuka', 'Sugimoto', 'alienated', 'unhappy', 'woman', 'are', 'friends', 'competitors', 'affection', 'Ikuya', 'Asano', 'teenagers', 'are', 'bit', 'too', 'hapless', 'tastes.Suddenly', 'Youko', 'attacked', 'mythical', 'beasts', 'high', 'school', 'Keiki', 'spirit', 'maneuvered', 'bring', 'two', 'friends', 'Youka', 'who', 'desperately', 'fit', 'be', 'normal', 'devastated', 'sudden', 'incursion', 'life', 'Catapulted', 'strange', 'unknown', 'land', 'more', 'worried', 'what', 'parents', 'will', 'think', 'nitty-gritty', 'survival', 'hostile', 'world', 'place', 'where', 'strangers', 'such', 'are', 'labelled', 'Kaikyaku', 'blamed', 'series', 'natural', 'social', 'disasters.When', 'Keiki', 'Youka', 'who', 'supposedly', 'chosen', 'princess', 'given', 'magical', 'sword', 'total', 'mess', 'everything', 'involved', 'weeping', 'moans', 'so', 'irritate', 'friends', 'Yuka', 'finally', 'mistake', 'been', 'made', 'really', 'chosen', 'princess', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Yuka', 'bit', 'as', 'nasty', 'Youka', 'hapless', 'viewer', 'would', 'probably', 'agree', 'case', 'dramatic', 'circumstances', 'being', 'uprooted', 'magical', 'land', 'where', 'spirits', 'serve', 'fortunate', 'residents', 'just', 'do', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'take', 'place', 'backdrop', 'out', 'complex', 'dysfunctional', 'personality', 'traits.So', 'far', 'story', 'showing', 'signs', 'being', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'where', 'Youko', 'personality', 'been', 'totally', 'suppressed', 'parents', 'scholl', 'either', 'something', 'self-definition', 'dies', 'trying', 'Hopefully', 'plot', 'will', 'avoid', 'being', 'quite', 'predictable', 'producers', 'writers', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'hurry', 'set', 'up', 'scenario', 'develop', 'Youko', 'Yuka', 'antagonists', 'Artistically', 'attractively', 'done', 'series', 'set', 'land', 'more', 'resembles', 'China', 'Japan', 'are', 'assured', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'China', '.On', 'whole', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'completely', 'excited', 'series', 'yet', 'artwork', 'music', 'are', 'good', 'acting', 'stiff', 'characters', 'not', 'particularily', 'sympathetic', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'shake', 'out', 'end', 'right', 'not', 'would', 'recommend', 'wait', 'see', 'attitude', 'Two', 'technical', 'issues', 'had', 'repeated', 'problems', 'DVD', 'player', 'One', 'so', 'far', 'been', 'completely', 'reliable', 'addition', 'original', 'DVD', 'Anime', 'Works', 'remaking', 'left', 'focus', 'bit', 'too', 'soft']",Twelve Kingdoms - Chapter 1 - Shoku

It's apparently based on a series of books(I usually prefer anime based on literature/manga)Youko Nakajima(Aya Hisakawa/Midge Mays), a girl who tries hard to do well/be liked/fit in(ok, little bit Kare Kano) is approached by a beautiful tall blond man, Keiki(Takehito Koyasu/Kurt Strauss), who tells her to accept his declaration of loyalty/servitude &amp; as soon as she does, all you-know-what breaks loose. Demons attack her in her classroom, but of course Keiki protects her.They escape to the roof which involves her &quot;friend&quot; Yuka Sugimoto(Aya Ishizu/Kirsty Page) &amp; Yuka's guy Ikuya Asano(Yuji Ueda/Joshua Seth) who Youko also has been eyeing. Sugimoto decides she's the one all this is about &amp; insists on going wherever Keiki's taking Youko, so all 3 end up in another land--the magical 12 Kingdoms where Sugimoto does her best to outdo Yui from Fushigi Yugi in the former friend turning on out heroine, &amp; so far, Sugimoto's winning--she's horrid. In this new land, Sugimoto &amp; Asano are obvious strangers, yet strangely Youko's looks have changed &amp; she understands the local language.This show has action, but isn't overdone(too much action in one ep), the emphasis is on the storytelling, which is great.

753667,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B00009EIRU,Sesho,"[3, 3]","If you're familiar at all with Japanese anime or manga you'll find that the story of a young boy or girl being thrown into another dimension and spending the whole series figuring out why they're there is nothing new. But like any good myth, the story is familiar but its the METHOD and SKILL of the storytelling that distracts from the cliches. Twelve Kingdoms is done on a more epic and yet more personal scale than most anime of this type, with the exception of Escaflowne.High school class president Youko Nakajima is a good girl and liked by everybody and the hardest thing she has to face is her parents telling her to dye her flaming red hair. That is until a mysteriously clad young man named Keiki shows up at her school telling her she has to leave with him because it's the only way he will be able to protect her from her enemies. He doesn't mean a class bully, he means a giant roc-like bird whose attack on Youko endangers the lives of her classmates. He gives her a sword only she can wield to fight against the awesome forces arrayed against her, for reasons she has no clue about. Keiki takes Youko and two of her classmates to another world, a world of magic and 12 kingdoms and spirits that take the shape of animals and humans. Along with Youko is Sugimoto, the class loner who Youko pities, and whose delusional visions and readings of Japanese legends makes the new world her dream come true. And then there's Asano, who both Youko and Sugimoto like. In the land of the Twelve Kingdoms, anyone who comes from our world is hunted down and killed because their appearances coincide with disastrous events.This first volume started off a little confusing but once you get into the groove, it gets better. There are lots of deep issues here, including the loss of innocence, the desire to belong versus your individuality, and the gaining of spiritual strength. The animation was great and some of the best quality I have seen. The story is epic. I did get sick of Youko at times. She seems to be maturing but she spends a lot of time here crying and having hissy-fits. She's getting stronger though.
