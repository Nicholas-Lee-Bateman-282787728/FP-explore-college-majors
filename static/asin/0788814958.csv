I have at least seen this movie over 8 times, and gets better and better. Porpoise Spit most people who are honest with themselves had those experiences in their lives. This is an ugly duckling kind of movie. Toni Collete's character went from Muriel to Mariel to self acceptance. Muriel lived her life to ABBA songs. Her personal soundtrack of her life. Trying to fit in with the pretty(shallow girls). Rachel Griffith's character was a party girl, but a good friend. Muriel's dad was an abusive man. Bill Hesslop ""Can't stop progress"". I felt sorry for Muriel's mom who committed suicide because of her husband's blatant affair. Also Mariel was so caught up in her nuptials, the one person who should be a part of it, was left out her mom. Despite this, this is still a wonderful movie a good laugh, cry and cheering for both Muriel and Rhonda. These ladies went through some really interesting twists and turns in one's life. I bought the ABBA greatest hits because of the movie.

At first viewing it is a typical quirky Aussie film with all the bizare characters and plot devices you've come to expect. On a closer viewing not only is it hilarious at every turn, it also depicts very real and very difficult true-life situations such as infidelity, cancer, and suicide. Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense, The Boys) is almost unrecognizable (due to a self imposed significant weight gain) yet brilliant as Muriel- an ABBA and marriage obsessed ""big boned"" girl. Her family is basically worthless and detestable, despite her father pointing out Muriel as being the ""loser"" of the family. Rachel Griffiths (award winner for her role in Showtime's Six Feet Under) is outstanding as Muriel's one true ally. Their ABBA lip-sync is forever forefront in my mind whenever I hear Dancing Queen and/or Waterloo! This movie is just plain fun and well worth watching again, and again, and again! ""Muriel!

The lack of a groom is the least of Muriel's obstacles.The Australian comedy stars a young Toni Collette (known now for playing mother roles inThe Sixth Sense,About a Boy, andLittle Miss Sunshine) and Rachel Griffiths, who went on to co-star inSix Feet UnderandBrothers and Sisterson US television.Muriel's Wedding is funny, satirical, campy, and ultimately celebrates true friendship triumphing over the illusion of romance taking us away from it all.",4,If you like Mamma Mia! it's time to rediscover Muriel,1216425600,"07 19, 2008",2008,932,"['saw', 'new', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'fun', 'could', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'Muriel', 'Wedding', 'favorite', 'ABBA-themed', 'movie', 'wedding-themed', 'ABBA-themed', 'quite', 'specialized', 'genre', '.Muriel', 'Wedding', 'not', 'full-on', 'musical', 'musicthroughout', 'including', 'Dancing', 'Queen', 'Waterloo', 'Fernando', 'sad-sack', 'Muriel', 'dreams', 'leaving', 'dead-end', 'existence', 'Porpoise', 'Spit', 'life', 'big', 'city', 'hopefully', 'fantasy', 'wedding', 'lack', 'groom', 'least', 'Muriel', 'obstacles.The', 'Australian', 'comedy', 'young', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'known', 'now', 'playing', 'mother', 'roles', 'inThe', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Boy', 'andLittle', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'who', 'went', 'co-star', 'inSix', 'Feet', 'UnderandBrothers', 'Sisterson', 'US', 'television.Muriel', 'Wedding', 'funny', 'satirical', 'campy', 'ultimately', 'true', 'friendship', 'triumphing', 'illusion', 'romance', 'taking', 'away']",N/A
81451,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0788814958,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Toni Collette is utterly adorable (in that funny looking girl touches heart kind of way) in the surprise stunner `Muriel's Wedding'; a film about a young girls dream of getting married.  The film is the perfect vehicle for Collette to dominate with a wonderfully complete character that is easy to love, easy to understand and fully deserving of our adoration.The film revolves around Muriel Heslop, a somewhat unattractive young woman who dreams of one day saying her vows across from her Prince Charming, but her dreams are often crushed down by her snotty friends and unsupportive father.  Constantly thought of as a worthless slacker, Muriel strives above all else to prove she is worth something, and she believes that she can accomplish this only by getting married, showing everything that thought she was worthy that she is indeed desirable.  She leaves home (the small town of Porpoise Spit) for Sydney where she finds herself a job and a roommate and a whole new life.  The film brings us through her journey, through the ups and downs, the boyfriend and the best friend and the eventual wedding, but what is more profound is the emotional journey that Muriel undergoes that uproots everything she thought she knew about life and where she was headed.The film is carried along effortlessly by a brilliant script that mixes well the comedic as well as the tragic sides of life; allowing us to laugh and cry with Muriel.  The script is further embellished by Collette's fantastic, Oscar worthy performance (in such a weak year I often wonder how the true gem performances were passed over by Oscar).  As Muriel she invites the audience to feel her every emotion and she embodies a complete woman so effortlessly.  Sure, some of the gags poke fun at her outward appearance, but what is so beautiful about `Muriel's Wedding' is that in the end it is her inward appearance that wins our hearts.Collette and company (including splendid performances by Rachel Griffiths and Bill Hunter) deliver a film that is rich in emotional depth and pure likeability.  I approaches the subjects of loyalty, friendship, love and trust with the right amount of humor to offset the seriousness but never so much that it makes light of the situation.It's funny; it's sweet; it's genuine and it's sincere.

81452,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,0788814958,Andy Orrock,"[3, 3]","It's now 10 years since &quot;Muriel's Wedding&quot; first release, and for the most part it has relegated to the back of people's minds as &quot;that ABBA movie.&quot;  However, with the exception of one side-splitting scene featuring a gotta-see-it-to-appreciate-it lip-synched rendition of 'Waterloo,' the music is but the background to a great story of rejection and friendship.When I saw &quot;About a Boy&quot; recently, I was reminded again about the fearlessness of Toni Collette, who I believe is one of the world's great (and certainly most underrated) actresses.  'Muriel' is where it all began for her.  Check her out in 'Muriel,' then 'Emma,' and finally 'About a Boy.'  This is a beautiful, talented lady not afraid to do whatever the role requires.  She's incredible.  Watch the bar scene in Hibiscus where her friends essentially disown her.  Her reaction is so stark and heartbreaking that I suspect that even her fellow actors were uncomfortable.  It's no wonder this role won her Australia's equivalent of an Oscar.  She's that good.This is where it also started for Rachel Griffiths, heartbreaking as Rhonda Epinstalk, Muriel's best friend.  This is your chance to see two real stars making their initial marks.  What a thrill in that.Also, never pass up a chance to see Bill Hunter, who put together three stirling performances back in the 1992 - 1994 timeframe:  &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; (as Dancing Federation Chairman Barry Fife - *the* funniest role ever on film); &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; (as 'Bob,' potential suitor to transvestite Bernadette as played by the great Terence Stamp); and here as failed local politico Bill Heslop (&quot;You Can't Stop Progress&quot;).

81456,A1Y1IMKX8ZRV4Y,0788814958,Ben Adam,"[6, 6]","The only complaint I have about Muriel's Wedding is that it was promoted as a comedy, and I feel that is a gross libel to the movie. The movie is far too rich with too many elements to be reduced to calling it just a comedy. It has the character of a drama with many comic moments, but to call it a comedy trivializes a great movie.The movie opens as the bouquet descends at a wedding in Porpoise Spit, a seaside town in Australia that is little more than beaches and shopping malls. The one who catches it, Muriel Heslop (Toni Colette), is the girl least likely to be married, as the other girls are quick to tell her. Dumpy and plain, Muriel is the embarrassment of her clique of pinup-class girls who soon tell her they want nothing to do with her.Muriel's woes are shared by her entire family. Her father (Bill Hunter), a less-than-successful politician, takes all his frustrations out on the rest of his family members, most of whom seem to spend their time in their respective dream worlds. Muriel spends her time listening to ABBA songs, looking at bridal gowns, and making up stories about getting married, when no prospects exist in reality. Along comes Deidre Chambers (Gennie Nevinson), a friend of her father's, who gives Muriel her big chance -- but not the one that her father thinks she is getting. She takes two blank checks from her parents' bank account, allegedly to buy supplies from Deidre to sell cosmetics, and in the next scene, Muriel appears at a vacation resort, enjoying the holiday that the girls who told her to take a hike are having. It is at the resort that Muriel runs into an old classmate, Rhonda Epinstalk (Rachel Griffiths), a feisty, flirtatious woman who mistakenly assumes that Muriel is there to have ""a last fling"" before getting married. Muriel actually begins to believe in the fable she has created, and she starts to turn into a very different woman than the crushed, broken spirit that left Porpoise Spit only a short time ago.Muriel and Rhonda surface again in Sydney, where they have moved and are now living the life of two bachelor girls living life on the town. The exhilaration ends abruptly when Rhonda has an accident that reveals she has cancer, and shortly thereafter, Muriel's father tracks her down. Confronted by her father and later by Deidre with the fact that she stole the money from the bank account, Muriel realizes that her father is having an affair behind her mother's back. The world that Muriel had found for herself is starting to crumble, and at this point, through a classified ad she meets David Van Arckle (Daniel Lapaine), a South African athlete needing to marry an Australian national so that he can remain in the country to participate in the Olympic games. The meeting is purely a business arrangement, and the marriage is a marriage of convenience, but Muriel happily participates in the elaborate affair, totally unconcerned that she has become just as artificial as the girls back in Porpoise Spit who once rejected her. Rhonda, now confined to a wheelchair, must return to Porpoise Spit, and the relationship has soured because of the lack of sincerity that Muriel has shown in her actions.When Muriel's mother (Jeanie Drynan) absent mindedly walks out of a discount store without paying, her husband comes to the police station to bail her out but takes the opportunity to tell her that he is leaving her to be with Deidre. Muriel gets a call telling her to come to Porpoise Spit immediately; her mother has died. At the funeral, there is a moment of truth for everyone in the family. Muriel runs out, overcome, and her husband has come for her. She realizes she cannot continue in the marriage and bids him farewell. Her sister (Gabby Millgate) tells her that her mother committed suicide, and her father tells her that Deidre will not be with him now. Muriel finally speaks to her father not as an inferior but as an equal adult; she has found herself.In the final scene, Muriel goes to the Epinstalk home, where she goes to tell Rhonda she wants to take her back with her to Sydney. Rhonda is with the other airhead girls that she and Muriel detested, and in a second, Rhonda agrees to go with Muriel. The friendship is on again, and back to Sydney they go, leaving behind the shallow world of Porpoise Spit.Toni Colette probably never dreamed she would make such a splash with this role. She had to gain 30 pounds to play the role, which was a major sacrifice, but it was not just that effort that made her performance so special. Bill Hunter and Jeanie Drynan play their parts masterfully and convincingly as Muriel's parents. Gabby Milgate's part gives her so little in terms of lines to say, but even so, she is unforgettable when she appears. Rachel Griffiths is superb throughout, managing to give the character of Rhonda depth, warmth, and wit in the relationship that ultimately turns Muriel from a social misfit into ""the woman she always was,"" to quote the words of the promos that came out when the film premi&egrave;red in 1995.",5,Thumbs Up to Down Under for a Great Film!,1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,5030,"['only', 'complaint',

A South African national needs to marry an Australian national in order to stay in the country and compete in Australia. Muriel agrees to do it, and because the swimmer is so handsome and popular, she too gains all kinds of meaningless popularity.

An impressive cast, wonderful story, and even more catchy soundtrack will leave you humming for weeks afterwards. Muriel's Wedding is a tour de force of wonderful filmmaking at its best.Muriel's Wedding tells the tale of Muriel Heslop, an appropriate name for a girl without much of an identity. At the beginning of the movie, Muriel is a put upon girl with a bleak future and an even more bleak present. She attends the wedding of a ""friend"" of hers in a stolen dress, which sets up Muriel's life as a series of lies she tells to make herself into something. One lie begets another, and soon, Mariel is off to Syndey with new gal pal Rhonda. Muriel struggles to find herself amidst the lies she tells and the real life for which she yearns, thus the story. This film is most unpredictable, and full of wonderful nuanced surprises that totally make sense to the story.Toni Collette deserves a standing ovation for her performance of Muriel. This was the first movie that I ever saw her in, and who knew the range of talent she possess. Just watch this movie, and then Sixth Sense, The Hours, and Connie and Carla, and see the range she covers. It should only be a matter of time before people realize her immense and total talent. Just watch Toni walking down the aisle as Muriel; her total, goofy joy is palpable... amazing stuff.Also appearing is the wonderful and solid Rachel Griffiths as her friend Rhonda. Together, they turn in a tour de force performance to help hapless Muriel find herself.Much must be said for director PJ Hogan's handling of this material. Given to a lesser director, the script may have gotten out of hand with its numerous twists and turns. Hogan trusts his actors and the stories, and allows them to show through. Also, the film is visually brilliant. Muriel's lip sync of the ABBA song in itself is a scene right from another Australian import ""Priscilla Queen of the Desert"".Not to mention the music. ABBA songs feature prominently throughout the movie, and actually allow for the story of the movie to progress wonderfully. It has been said that profits from Muriel's Wedding allowed for the creation of another ABBA delight, the musical ""Mamma Mia"". If that's true, what another wonderful gift from this movie.It seemed in the 1990's, Australian performed a wonderful trifecta of movies that blew away American audiences: Muriel's Wedding, Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, and  Strictly Ballroom. Muriel's Wedding may be the lesser known of the three, but it is equally as strong.

Hoping to shed the title of ""useless"" bestowed on her by her father, Muriel (Toni Collette) absconds with the family's savings to an island resort, where she meets vivacious, straight-talking Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths).  Rhonda is the catalyst for Muriel to become a new person, but unfortunately Muriel takes her obsession with weddings one step too far and marries just for the sake of it.  She thinks she has finally ""made it"", but comes to realise that there's more to life than public image.The soundtrack is a gloriously appropriate ABBA symphony, although both Dancing Queen and the film's original theme tune are over-utilised.  It is surely partly due to ABBA's pleasant familiarity that it is so easy to become emotionally involved in the film, and the viewer will likely experience the whole gamut of feelings during its course.  The finale, whilst upbeat, fortunately doesn't stumble into the realm of saccharine moralism (which so many filmmakers seem to think it is necessary to conclude with).  Instead, we feel the triumph along with Muriel and Rhonda as they bid a raucous farewell to Porpoise Spit.",4,"""Now my life's as good as an ABBA song""",1042329600,"01 12, 2003",2003,1739,"['Muriel', 'Wedding', 'Australian', 'gem', 'perhaps', 'suffers', 'somewhat', 'being', 'earmarked', ""'comedy"", 'Certainly', 'are', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'film', 'mere', 'cheap', 'cheesy', 'crowd-pleaser', 'As', 'well', 'dealing', 'insularity', 'cattiness', 'hometown', 'Porpoise', 'Spit', 'Muriel', 'also', 'must', 'face', 'suicide', 'mother', 'paralysing', 'best', 'friend', 'tragedies', 'Muriel', 'come', 'out', 'top', 'same', 'time', 'strike', 'blow', 'anybody', 'who', 'ever', 'been', 'snubbed', 'in-crowd.The', 'characterisation', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'particularly', 'Muriel', 'family', 'no-hopers', 'Hoping', 'shed', 'title', 'useless', 'bestowed', 'father', 'Muriel', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'family', 'savings', 'island', 'resort', 'where', 'vivacious', 'straight-talking', 'Rhonda', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'Rhonda', 'catalyst', 'Muriel', 'become', 'new', 'person', 'unfortunately', 'Muriel', 'obsession', 'weddings', 'one', 'step', 'too', 'far', 'marries', 'just', 'sake', 'finally', 'made', 'realise', 'more', 'life', 'public', 'image.The', 'soundtrack', 'gloriously', 'appropriate', 'ABBA', 'symphony', 'Dancing', 'Queen', 'film', 'original', 'theme', 'tune', 'are', 'over-utilised', 'surely', 'partly', 'due', 'ABBA', 'pleasant', 'familiarity', 'so', 'easy', 'become', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'film', 'viewer', 'will', 'likely', 'experience', 'whole', 'gamut', 'feelings', 'course', 'finale', 'whilst', 'upbeat', 'fortunately', ""n't"", 'stumble', 'realm', 'saccharine', 'moralism', 'so', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'seem', 'think', 'necessary', 'conclude', 'Instead', 'feel', 'triumph', 'Muriel', 'Rhonda', 'bid', 'raucous', 'farewell', 'Porpoise', 'Spit']",N/A

81496,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,0788814958,K. Boullosa,"[2, 4]","Calling ""Muriel's Wedding"" a ""chick flick"" is not to be disrespectful to this poignant film about an Ugly Duckling who evolves - not into a Swan, but into a human being released from the conviction that life is only worth living as a Swan, and that there is only one kind of Swan - the pretty, married kind.  It's a chick flick not because it's shallow, but because few women will have trouble relating to the anguish experienced by its main character, the socially afflicted, gauche Muriel Heslop.  I don't say that men won't, only that they will need to cross some unfamiliar terrain to get there.  Women will respond with immediacy, especially any woman whose early years were marked by a sense of being that Ugly Duckling.In addition to Toni Collette's memorable performance in the title role, the film also contains a wonderful performance by Rachel Griffiths as Muriel's best friend, the forthright, in-your-face, passionate Rhonda Epinstalk.  A marvellous supporting cast includes the familiar Bill Hunter (who played a similar role in ""Strictly Ballroom"") as Muriel's father, nursing his failed political ambitions while neglecting to take a hand in straightening out his brood of lazy, drifting, goal-challenged kids, and Jeannie Drynan in a sadly affecting portrayal of Muriel's harried, unfortunate mother.Muriel and Rhonda have grown up together in suburban Porpoise Spit, whose nearest sophisticated urban center is Sydney, although air travel is required to get there.  Stiflingly provincial, Porpoise Spit is one of those places where, if a girl isn't pretty, slim, popular with boys, and engaged to be married by 19, she might as well cut her throat.  Cutting her throat is pretty much what the heavy, awkward, self-loathing Muriel feels like doing every day.  Muriel has hovered for years at the edge of a small clique of girls who barely tolerate her - the kind of girls whose only accomplishments are to look good in bikinis, wear lots of makeup, be sexually promiscuous, and get jobs in the Mall.  Their vision doesn't extend beyond marrying one of the well-built local ne'er-do-wells in a cloud of white tulle and flowers.At 22, out of school, with no job, no boyfriend, no plans, and no particular skills, all Muriel hungers for is acceptance by this clique.  She is fixated on the idea that if she can only get married in a splendid wedding of her own, it will prove to these distasteful little witches that she is as good as they are - that they are really worthless has never occurred to poor, beknighted Muriel, who spends days locked in her room listening to Abba songs in a fog of inchoate longing.The film opens at the wedding of Tanya, the first member of the clique to hit the marital jackpot - but soon after, the clique unexpectedly find themselves together again, as Tanya relates how her groom could not do his marital duty on their wedding night - due to his exhaustion from indulging in an extramarital affair (in fact, he was busy screwing Nicole, one of Tanya's bridesmaids, during the wedding reception).  To comfort Tanya, the girls plan a trip to Hibiscus Island together, a sort of replacement honeymoon.  They cruelly disinvite Muriel from accompanying them, accusing her of being an embarrassment to them because she's fat and doesn't know how to dress or behave.Muriel is so devastated by this rejection that when her father's mistress offers Muriel a job selling cosmetics, and Muriel's mother gives her a blank check to purchase the beauty supplies, Muriel instead takes the money and absconds with it to Hibiscus Island, where she pretends to be surprised at meeting up with the little clique, who excoriate her publicly for following them.  Tanya throws an exotic drink in Muriel's face, warning her to stay away from them, as another member of the clique murmurs sadly, ""You've-got-no-dignity, Muriel.""However, Muriel finds her ex-schoolmate, Rhonda Epinstalk, is also vacationing on the island alone, and the two strike up a friendship, the first of Muriel's life with someone who not only accepts her as an equal, but who thinks Muriel is ""amazing"" just as she is.  Rhonda despises the clique that has intimidated Muriel for so long, and to Muriel's shock, when invited to join them for a drink, Rhonda refuses and not only tells them off smartly, but informs Tanya that the woman her new husband is having an affair with is Nicole, a bona fide member of the clique, and standing by Tanya's side, precipitating a ferocious cat fight.In Rhonda's company, Muriel actually begins to have fun, and to a routine done to the Abba hit ""Waterloo"", she and Rhonda win the evening talent contest. However, when Muriel returns from her vacation, she realizes that her theft of the funds from her father's bank account has been discovered.  Ignoring her mother's pleas for information about the money, Muriel gets back into the cab that has just brought her home from the airport, and runs away to Sydney (City of Brides), where she and Rhonda land a couple of jobs and get a flat together.Led by the free-wheeling, high-spirited Rhonda, Muriel begins to date a bit and enjoy some nightlife, and in her desperate desire to shed her old identity, changes her name to Mariel.  She's still bedeviled by her marriage fixation, but at least she's out from under the deadly miasma of Porpoise Spit and her dysfunctional family home.From then on, the film follows Muriel's sometimes tortuous, sometimes hilarious evolution from lonely spinster to independent woman.  Along the way, she gets into one scrape after another.  Muriel stumbles on the idea of presenting herself as a prospective bride at every bridal shop in Sydney, trying on dresses and getting the staff to photograph her in them so she can show the photos to her desperately ill mother or sister, depending on what day it is.  Muriel even gets to have the wedding of her dreams with a South African Olympic swimming hopeful who needs an Australian wife in order to be able to compete for Australia instead of South Africa, which is about to be booted from games for its apartheid system - the swimmer's family and trainer pay Muriel $10,000 to accommodate his needs.It takes two unexpected tragedies, and the experience of the sham marriage, for Muriel to realize, finally, that her fantasies are just that: fantasies - limited and empty, and blocking the possibilities for new goals and enjoyment that life might hold if she moves beyond them.  Despite setbacks and uncertainties, Muriel and Rhonda finally leave Porpoise Spit joyously behind them, as Tanya runs behind them shrieking, ""How dare you say something like that to me!  I'm beautiful!  I'm married!"" - words that at last arouse nothing but laughter in Muriel.The portraits of suburban Australia, and of the tyranny of the painful sexual inequities that can afflict the early lives of those who don't fit in, and of the cultural devaluation of single women, are well-drawn and emotionally engaging. Toni Collette inhabits Muriel's warm and hungry soul - occasionally Collette takes it a bit over the top, but for the most part she nails it perfectly.  When Muriel is discovered and ""outed"" by Rhonda during the last of her bridal shop masquerades, and Muriel sinks down in the dressing room in the finery she feels she has no right to wear, sobbing, ""Why can't it be ME? Why isn't it ever ME?"" there are few women whose hearts will not go out to her.This is a charming and poignant film, a slice of life that will remain with the viewer after the credits fade.",3,Chick

81497,AUD3OVKGE7QRO,0788814958,"Kerry A. Walsh ""lilgracie346""","[2, 2]","A common theme of Australian comedy, the concept of the ""ugly duckling"" and how she manages to navigate in a sea of swans is handled interestingly (and on many different levels) in this film.  One of the best things about Muriel's Wedding is that it doesn't just hold the ""ugly duckling"" out as someone who is to be pitied and who never fails to make the ""right"" decision as some have been in other films (see: She's All That, Pretty in Pink, etc.).  Muriel really blunders her way through this movie and is a true person rather than just a flat, uninteresting caricature of herself.  Muriel repeatedly makes decisions that hurt others and, ultimately, herself as well.  Muriel is easily relatable for these reasons - she doesn't hold the moral high ground on the viewer as happens occasionally in other films with similar thematic arcs.  We watch Muriel mess up and fail over and over again and we empathize with her because we've all made similar poor decisions in the past.

Muriel is passionate and sensitive and smart enough to know that a true friend is worth more than a fantasy.

Turns out she made the move by stealing money from dad, which she uses to pay for her best friend's cancer surgery, which turns out badly.All the while, family angst and Muriel's fantasy about being a bride trump the social action in the film. She realizes her dream when she agrees to marry a South African Olympic athlete who can only compete for Australia if he acquires citizenship, which he does through marriage. Even though a loveless marriage, it works for both members.""Why would you marry someone you didn't love?"" the swimmer asks Muriel.""You did.""""I want to win!"" he responds.""So do I.""And win Muriel does, metaphically and in life, by gaining fame through TV and newspaper coverage of her fancy wedding, and by turning around her peers that once belittled her...beautiful girls that couldn't wait to be her bridesmaids.The loveless marriage is followed by the death of Muriel's estranged mother and her being reunited with family -- including her estranged and insensitive dad -- back in Porpoise Spit. The films ends on an upbeat with Muriel and friend returning to Sydney, seemingly leaving all their problems behind for a second time.Collette is nothing short of a miracle in this film, which has parallels to ""Bridget Jones Diary"". She is a wonder in her delivery, facial expressions, voicing and overall acting. The script is a masterpiece of sardonic humor laced with pathos.

81504,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,0788814958,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[1, 1]","Muriel Heslop (the vibrant, energetic Toni Collette) is a hopeless romantic. She spends her days locked in her bedroom, listening to Abba songs and dreaming of the day she'll be able to put on a wedding dress. Her walls are covered with momentos of her two favorite things in life: posters of the singing group and pictures of brides-to-be. Part of her reason for living in a fantasy world is that her family life is so depressing. Her brothers and sisters spend all day lounging in front of the television. Her mother (Jeane Drynan) is oblivious to the goings-on around her, and her father (Bill Hunter) doesn't miss any opportunity to brand Muriel as ""useless."" In fact, he derides her as the most useless of his children. On top of that, her bitchy friends call her an embarrassment and announce that they don't want her accompanying them on a vacation. Muriel takes all this to heart and decides that the only way to change her life is to leave the town of Porpoise Spit and find a man. To this end, she follows her friends to the resort of Hibiscus Island. Once there, she encounters Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths), an old school chum. In this wild party girl, Muriel discovers something she has never before had -- a real friend, someone who actually cares about her.One of the most pleasant aspects of Muriel's Wedding is the distinctly unconventional third act. No one seeing this movie will confuse it with a Hollywood picture, as it continually flouts the ""feel good"" formulas that typically characterize this sort of romantic comedy. The ending is far-from-perfect, but it's a great deal better than several obvious alternatives. Nevertheless, parts of Muriel's Wedding are heavy-handed and, as a result, needlessly uncomfortable to view. There are times when director Paul Hogan (who will go on to helm My Best Friends Wedding) almost seems to enjoy belittling and degrading Muriel. While it's necessary to understand her low self-image, the director goes to excessive, almost-sadistic, lengths to get his point across. On these occasions, the film becomes a little difficult to endure. Balancing these moments are some high-energy scenes, including a wonderful lip-synch of Abba's ""Waterloo"" by Muriel and Rachel, Muriel trying on wedding dresses to the tune of ""Dancing Queen"", and an almost-sex scene featuring sofa cushions being unzipped instead of skirts. The soundtrack, featuring at least five Abba songs, is effectively energetic, and includes a Peter Best- arranged instrumental version of ""Dancing Queen"" performed by a full orchestra.Muriel's Wedding isn't a perfect comedy, tragedy, or drama, but it contains enough original elements of each to make it worth a look.

Wood ""Content Writer and Reviewer""","[0, 0]","Muriel's Wedding takes place in the early nineties in Porpoise Spit, Australia and follows the antics of Muriel Heslop (Toni Collette, Sixth Sense) on her journey to wedded bliss. The hilarity all starts at a wedding where Muriel catches the bouquet and miffs one of the maids (and so-called friends). She then gets arrested at the wedding for wearing a dress she stole from the local boutique (a recurring theme for her). A major hurdle for Muriel is that she isn't popular; even her father is more popular than she is. Muriel insists on hanging out with a crowd of would-be-harlots who berate her constantly for never listening, not wearing the right clothes, being fat, listening to 70s music, and constantly embarrassing them.After being dumped by her friends, Muriel steals $12,000 from her father and shows up on the lavish trip they went on and pretends to be surprised to see them. The girls become even more volatile but in walks Rhonda Epinstalk (Rachel Griffiths, Brothers and Sisters), an old classmate, to save the day. They bond with their shared love of Abba then run off to Sydney, the ""City of Brides"", where they get jobs across the street from one another and share a flat. Muriel finally begins enjoying her life and after devising a way to get her dream wedding realizes there is more to life than getting married.This is a charming film about growing up, self-esteem, body-image, surviving in a dysfunctional family and learning to live on your own. In the end Muriel realizes she has an opportunity for change that has nothing to do with her appearance. The film is full of laughs but also great sadness (one of the characters develops cancer and another commits suicide). And of course there's catchy Abba music throughout (Mamma Mia, Fernando, Dancing Queen, Waterloo) to keep your toes tapping.

Australian movies are quirky and have a party animal type of feel to them, but a movie about a wedding?  I was expecting a chick flick, but got something else all together.Before she would hit it big (as well as loose the weight), Toni Collette plays Murial, a loser in a small town in Australia.  There is nothing about Murial's existence that is positive.  She is a loser, an overweight high school drop out without a job or anything else to do except sit in her room and listen to ABBA.  Her peers are snotty, bratty and barely tolerate her presence.  When the movie opens, we see Marial at a wedding where much to her short lived happiness of catching the bouquet, one of her ""friends"" says to not be so greedy and give it to someone who actually has a chance of attracting a man.  And the skin tight leopard print number she got just for the occasion was shoplifted.  She lives at home with her obnoxious oaf of a father, her suffering mother, and a bunch of siblings equally miserable and ignorant.  And she lives in a town called Porpoise Spit.  It doesn't get much worse than this, does it?Then, one day, Mariel decides to make a change.  She joins forces with a childhood friend who she reunites with named Rhonda, and when she is entrusted with a large wad of cash to be deposited at the bank, she steals the money and takes off with Rhonda to Sydney.  They live it up, partying and partying some more.  Quite suddenly, however, things take a darker turn.  Rhonda is diagnosed with cancer and will spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair.  Mariel has to go home and face the wrath of her father for her irresponsiblity and her mother's suicide.  And then, back to the original theme of the movie, Mariel suddenly finds herself married to a famous athlete who needs a green card.  She's sort of a celebrity.This movie has a variety of messages hidden in screwball comedy antics and caddy remarks between characters.  The depression theme is there, no question, feeling Mariel's wants, hopes and dreams of breaking out of her family and small town's clausterphobia.  Having terrible friends will bring you down, life experiences have taught me.  The women she hangs around with really aren't her friends, they aren't even each other's friends.  One is sleeping with the other's husband and yet they remain friends.  Why?  Maybe because they are lonely as well.  Mariel is the hero of the story, but she's not a true blue hero.  She does after all commit everything from petty to serious crime (shoplifting and stealing the money from her father).  Her friend Rhonda is aspiring to greater things, but as her health takes a sudden turn she declines into depression that Mariel had before.  Mariel's wedding of convenience is the crux of the story, as it has been reinforced time and again that women are nothing if they are not married.  Not loved, but married.  Her husband doesn't really like her that much at first, but his affection grows for her.  Would it have otherwise?  Hard to tell, as it's an odd situation.  Mariel realizes perhaps the most important lesson to be learned - she doesn't need anyone or anything to accept her.  She doesn't have to be a loser sitting at home dreaming, she can be whatever she wants to be as long as she gets up off the couch and DOES something.  And being in a loveless marriage will bring her down.  It sets her free rather than confines.A crazy movie, full of silly disco glam and Aussie quirkiness.

The story follows Muriel (Collette), an overweight ugly duckling who is ridiculed by her friends and her father but finds solace in ABBA songs and best friend Griffiths.  Moving from her home town of Porpoise Spit she begins to find a new life for herself.Fortunately this rites-of-passage drama doesn't lay it on heavy with the sentimentality.  This brings about a conclusion that's nothing short of depressing but still poignant.  The comedy is wonderfully crass, especially from Muriel's friends from Porpoise Spit and the sheer gaudiness of the whole movie is beautifully carried by all concerned.  When Muriel's bridesmaids waddle up the aisle to an ABBA song, or Collette and Griffiths jubilently belt out tunes at a karaoke bar, you'll be laughing.Given this, it's rare to find such comedy that will bring you crashing down to earth with suicide, cancer and an unhappy arranged marriage.  This is one of those movies that will never make you cry; it will make you sympathise with its characters.  It's certainly a great gift of Hogan's that he manages to pull both genres off so well at the same time.But this wouldn't be half as good if it wasn't for Collette and Griffiths' magnificently crazy, emotional performances.  'Muriel's Wedding' should also be cheered for the fact that it doesn't succumb to typical Hollywood glitz and glamour.

81522,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0788814958,Reviewer,"[10, 12]","Where do you go and to whom do you turn, when it's time to emerge from adolescence and get on with your life, but you find yourself incapacitated from having had your self esteem methodically peeled away year after miserable year by a brutal father who has convinced you that you're worth less than a piece of garbage a dog wouldn't touch?  That's the story of Muriel Heslop (Toni Collette), a young woman who, along with her brothers and sisters, has been mercilessly and ceaselessly denigrated and publicly humiliated by her father, Bill Heslop (Bill Hunter), seemingly since the day she was born, in ""Muriel's Wedding,"" directed by P.J. Hogan.  Bill Heslop is a local councilman in the less-than-thriving city of Porpoise Point, Australia.  In the eyes of those who don't know him, he's a great man, a hero even; and he's definitely a legend in his own mind.  But in his own home he doles out psychological abuse relentlessly-- and the sad thing is, he does it seemingly without realizing what he's doing.  Muriel, out of school, but so unsure of herself that she's unable to wrench herself free of the dominating Mr. Heslop, escapes into a world of ABBA songs and daydreams of her own wedding, which she perceives as being the ultimate reward-- the thing that will finally bring her happiness and give her life meaning.Not surprisingly, Muriel has some problems to work out before she can even think of making a change that will turn her life around.  Her lack of self esteem has rendered her socially inept, overweight, slow witted and incapable of making a decision.  And as far as the wedding that will change everything-- well, Muriel has no boyfriend, never has had one, and there are certainly no prospects on the horizon.  Her dream of being ABBA's ""Dancing Queen,"" is about as remote as pigs that can fly.  Muriel does have friends, however; four girls she knows from school, one of whom just got married, into whose lives she basically imposes herself in a last ditch effort to find acceptance any way she can.  Then one night, even they tell her not to come around them anymore, that she is an embarrassment.  And for Muriel, it's the final straw that drives her to do something desperate.  Something that will ultimately change her life forever.That it is billed as an ""Hilarious comedy about friends, fun and unexpected surprises"" and ""Hysterically funny,"" makes you wonder about the marketing machinery of the entertainment industry.  Is it a funny movie?  Yes, it is; just as life is often funny, even when it's at it's worst.  Hilarious?  Yes.  All of which seems contradictory to the story that is at the heart of the film.  And yet, it's those very contradictions, those same multi-layered complexities of which life is made, that makes this such a wonderful movie.  On one hand, Bill Heslop is one of the most despicable characters you'll ever encounter in a film; and on the other, Muriel is one of the most sympathetic.  The humor of this film is derived from the natural and very real situations in which the characters find themselves.  And just as there is something within us all that at times allows us to laugh at the misfortunes of others (perhaps occasionally born of a ""better you than me"" mentality), there are things you're going to laugh at in this film.  But as you sit back and watch as one misery upon another is heaped upon Muriel, you'd have to be either an unfeeling moron or a sociopath not to be crying at least on the inside, even if you're laughing on the outside.  There are times when you just want to reach out to Muriel and let her know that one way or another, everything is going to be okay.Toni Collette (in her second film) gives an incredibly moving performance as Muriel, making her about as real as a character can get.  She conveys so much through her body language and facial expressions alone, that you can feel the torment and the turmoil she keeps bottled up and buried deep within herself, without ever having to hear her speak a word.  Anyone who's ever known even a moment of misfortune in their life will be able to relate to her.  Unwittingly, she wears her feelings on her sleeve; not that she wants to, but when your cup of adversity finally overflows, it's going to show.  And it takes a special actor to play a character like this and make her so convincing, without taking it over the top or into the gray planes of melodrama.  And Collette is that actor.  She's perfect in this role, and she had to be for this film to work.  Anything less than a perfect counterpoint to the character of Bill Heslop would've quickly derailed this project, and the humor alone wouldn't have done the job.  All of the tricks, jokes and funny lines in the world wouldn't have been enough to overcome that very real sense of loathing Bill Hunter brings to the role of Heslop.The supporting cast includes Rachel Griffiths (Rhonda), Sophie Lee (Tania), Rosalind Hammond (Cheryl), Belinda Jarrett (Janine), Pippa Grandison (Nicole), Jeanie Drynan (exceptionally effective as Betty, Muriel's mother) and Daniel Lapaine (David).  In one of the most uplifting scenes you're ever likely to see in a movie, Muriel and Rhonda lip-sync to ABBA's ""Waterloo,"" which in the screenplay probably came across as something fun but rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things.  But on the screen, it becomes a moment that is absolutely transporting.  And that's the magic of ""Muriel's Wedding.""  It takes you into the dark, but never allows you to languish there; ultimately, it takes you into the light, and when it does, it's brighter than anything you could imagine.",5,Incredibly Touching

81524,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,0788814958,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","This retro-review is for the widescreen version of ""Muriel's Wedding"",still available as of this writing and at a steal of a price.This is one movie I pull out again and again and it never disappoints no matter how many times I've see it.Toni Collette(in her 3rd movie) stars as the overweight Muriel Heslop.The movie is in three ""acts"",""The bouquet"",""Sydney,city of brides"" and ""The Wedding"".It opens with Muriel amongst a throng of other wedding attendees catching the bridal bouquet.Her four ""friends"",which includes the bride,implore her to give it to another group friend as it should be hers by rights,not Muriel's.Muriel hurt,reluctantly gives the bouquet over only to have it thrown back in her face because her friend had just broken up with her boyfriend.As everyone disperses some nasty remarks are made Muriel's way.This in essence sets the tone for the rest of the movie and especially the character of Muriel herself.She is hanging out and trying to fit in with a group of selfish self-absorbed gals from her hometown of Porpoise Spit(you've gotta love that name!),and she will endure almost anything to get their approval and in the process prove to herself and others that she is ""something"",not ""nothing"".At the wedding she is arrested for stealing the very dress she wears,which she denies having stolen but actually did(showing how far she'll go to be accepted and fit in).She's taken home by the police.Here,at home, we are given a fuller understanding of the backdrop of her life.She's 22 years old and still lives at home with her family.Her father is a town councillor who once tried running for the Senate but lost.He blames this on his family and further more publicly derides them all as lazy and shiftless,while all the time treating his wife like a doormat who is there just for his whimsy and beck and call.In fact just as Muriel feels like ""nothing"",her mother has as much right to say this if not more than her.The only difference between the two is how each deal with their lives.Muriel at this time of her life is trying to fit in,while her mother has obviously tried in the past but lost(in more ways than one) and really mirrors what is in store for Muriel.And she along with her mother,sister and two brothers seem to be chained to this never ending loop of despair,with no hope of change.An opportunity arises through a lady friend of Muriel's father.She runs a beauty consultant business and ""coincidentally"" pops in on Bill with his family and other business associates an unusual amount of times throughout the film(we later find out why).She offers to give Muriel a chance to sell cosmetics for her.Muriel takes the job and is given a blank check by her mother(on orders from her father,of course) to get her started.At this same time her four ""friends"" are going to be taking a resort vacation on Hibiscus Island.Before they leave they finally give Muriel the grand rejection by booting her out of the group and Muriel is devastated.But with the blank check and her new job,Muriel decides to use it as the premise to take a vacation of a lifetime and also to be with her ""friends"",so she follows them.While there Muriel is recognized by an old fellow high schooler Rhonda,played by Rachel Griffiths(her first movie).They instantly hit it off and become good friends.When Muriel lands back home she finds out that the scheme has been found out and it's time to pay the piper.Before the piper has a chance to catch her she high tails it back to the cab she arrived in and takes off.She gets her friend Rhonda and both take off southward to Sydney to start a new life.Rhonda gets a job across the street from Muriel,who works in a video rental store.One day a local guy comes in to rent a movie and asks her for her very first formal date.Rhonda takes Muriel and her boyfriend to a ravers club and bumps into two hot American sailors who she takes back home,leaving Muriel and the new boyfriend alone for a while.Eventually both arrive back home also, but to a very loud ""commotion"" afoot in the girls only bedroom.A clothing trail in the hall,a mixture of Rhondas' and the sailors,tells the tale.Muriel amid long moments of awkward silence,makes her boyfriend a cup of ""tea""(Muriel is NOT a whiz in the kitchen!) and they both sit down to drink it;Muriel on a bean bag chair.Finally her amour can take no more and forcefully kisses her.Getting little resistance he moves on and on and Muriel giggles with delight at each piece of clothing he removes.However when he unzips the bean bag chair instead of Muriels' leather pants,bedlam ensues.Muriels' screeches bring in the two sailors from the next room who think her boyfriend has made some unwanted advances towards her.Both sailors are without clothes as one pins the ""perpetrator"" down, while the other tries to console Muriel,who screeches even louder when she spies his ""nether regions"".During this raucous Rhonda falls backwards and slides down a wall.Her legs have given out.It turns out Rhonda has a cancerous tumour in her brain.One operation that would supposedly remove it entirely turns into another from which she'll never walk again.Rhonda relies heavily on Muriel but Muriel,ever the mental wanderer,continues to dream of marriage and travels  to several dress shops in Sydney.She has a different story for each store clerk she meets but it usually has something to do with a sick relative who will be unable to attend her ""wedding"".In return she gets to try the dresses on and gets a picture to go along to boot.At one store Rhonda finds her and lets Muriel knows she needs to get a life.With this Muriel gets serious.She scours the papers and sees an ad right up her alley.It says that an South African olympic swimmer is looking to marry an Australian girl.After checking him and the situation out further she finds out the swimmer is only doing it to get citizenship so he can compete for Australia.The marriage will only be in name only and for a minimum of four months to comply with regulations.Nonetheless Muriel marries the swimmer getting ALOT of media attention and thinking she's finally made it.She also hopes for more than the shallow marriage it is.Reality rears its' ugly head.During this time her father has been formally charged with taking bribes.He is in Sydney awaiting a hearing and also it is learned he has left his wife for his friend the beauty consultant.Her father also has let it be known publicly that Muriel stole money from him and uses that to try and gain public sympathy and as an excuse for him taking a bribe in the first place.At the wedding father gives the bride away and Muriels' mother finally arrives alone but late just as her daughter leaves the church.Muriel doesn't see her and mother is crushed.Rhonda,without Muriel,is forced to go home and live with her mother.After a time Muriel is forced to face reality and realize the marriage sham is just that and has nowhere to go.Thrown in on all this is a call home as  Muriels' mother has committed suicide.She flies back for the funeral and finds her Dad wants her to stay to mind the house and her siblings.She stands up to him finally and says it is HIS responsibility.His ersatz girlfriend it seems isn't keen on having his kids in tow anyways,so that ""romance"" cooled faster than an ice age;he does as Muriel says.Muriel realizes she has finally found herself and she goes to collect Rhonda and both fly back to Sydney,to start their new lives together.Fade out.It's quite the movie with alot of ups and downs for all characters but it is a feel good story with a feel good ending that leaves you smiling when the credits finally run.The movie also has become famous for its'soundtrack of ABBA songs.Muriels musical solace throughout the movie was ABBA.In fact there's a nice sequence when her and Rhonda are on Hibiscus Island doing a lip sync to ""Waterloo"".Furthermore it was ""Muriels Wedding"" that pretty much single handedly revived the interest in ABBA music in the 90s and onward resulting in new releases of their recorded material,videos and even a popular theatrical play ""Mama Mia"".This movie is certainly one with a wide appeal for women as well as men.I would recommend though that if you have any children below the ages of say 16 that you be careful when viewing this as some of the scenes and language can get pretty ""descriptive"" at times.Other than that I highly recommend this picture to everyone.The film has no pretensions,is bold and says:""Here I am-love me or leave me"".Plot wise it does have a tendency to wander at times and slow things a bit,but it does get back on track quickly and the many precious funny sequences that are in it tend to make up for the others.Remember also that as much fun as this movie is it does get serious,and sometimes very quickly.But it is to the credit of the actors,script writers and the director that all the fine tapestry that is Muriel's Wedding comes off as well as it does.If you haven't taken the plunge there is no better time to get ""Muriel's Wedding"" and treat yourself, than right now.You won't be disappointed.",4,Muriel's Wedding-A fun flick from begining to end!,1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,9082,"['retro-review',

81525,A1N8KHEWAAIO49,0788814958,Rob,"[7, 7]","In the tradition of Strictly Ballroom and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, Muriel's Wedding continues the idiosyncratic, character driven films of 90's Australia. On the surface Muriel's Wedding  is a comedy but it is a comedy with a sharp edge and a black underbelly.  Toni Collette is superb as the frumpy and dreamy Muriel Heslop. With a  burning ambition to be wedded and a passion and joy for ABBA music, she  takes us on a quest to eventual self-acceptance and self-respect. Along the  way we get to laugh with her, cry with her and above all we are privileged  to share her love for life.Featuring a superb support cast (Bill Hunter,  Jeannie Drynan - superb as Muriel's tragic mum, Rachel Griffiths and Sophie  Lee)it is hard to fault any performance except for the slightly wooden  Daniel La Paine. PJ Hogan directs with a love for his characters and an  understanding and appreciation of suburban  backwater 1990's Australia.  Standout scenes include the ABBA contest, Muriel's attempt at being seduced  on a beanbag and any scene featuring the superb Jeannie Drynan as Muriel's  mum. Muriel's journey from Porpoise Spit to the bright lights of Sydney are  a journey many of us have made in many ways and and on many personal  levels. In Muriel we have a heroine that we can love and laugh with. It is  great to see the wonderful Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths go on to  greater Hollywood success with The Sixth Sense and The Other Sister. A fine  example of PJ Hogan's work before directing My Best Friend's Wedding.

This is life and the  giddy illusions of Muriel become breathtakingly sad when one comes to  understand her home life or watches her mother's slow destruction. The  movie is also optimistic and proves that we can change our fantasies for  reality and yet survive.  This is one of the most beautiful stories ever  put to film and requires more than one viewing.  I salute Australians and  Australian film making.

81527,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0788814958,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 9]","Watching &#65533;Muriel&#65533;s Wedding&#65533; it&#65533;s incredible to think that I ever considered this flick a comedy.  Instead, it&#65533;s one of those extremely off-beat Australian dramas that&#65533;s so outright weird, it looks hysterical, but isn&#65533;t.  Muriel is a loser &#65533; we learn that much in the first scene.  Big and unloved, she goes to weddings in clothes she shoplifts, and is isolated by just about everybody (except the cops &#65533; somehow, being Muriel, it&#65533;s just her luck that the clerk of the store she stole from was also a guest).  Her family life is a quiet hell &#65533; her father is a local developer and political figure in their sun-baked coastal town of &#65533;Porpoise Spit&#65533;, though it&#65533;s clear that his life is one of bitterness.  (By the end of the film, we learn that Muriel&#65533;s father was an also-ran in national politics, a failure that he&#65533;s passed onto his family which is cowed into timidity by his relentless verbal abuse.)  Muriel hangs onto two dreams &#65533; one of which has to do with singing and dancing to ABBA, while the other involves getting married&#65533;to somebody.  Hungry for friends, Muriel steals from her father so she can afford to join them on a trip to Hibiscus Island (they are not pleased to see her).  She also meets Rhonda, a much sexier and adventurous type played by a pre-&#65533;Six Feet Under&#65533; Rachel Griffiths.  The two bond and Muriel comes alive for the first time in her life.  Muriel also finds she can&#65533;t go back home because her father is being indicted for the money Muriel stole.  Setting herself up in Sydney with Rhonda (and not telling Rhonda the truth about why she left home) Muriel finds she likes life outside of her shell.  She also finds ways to satisfy her dream of being a bride w/o getting married &#65533; being feted by wedding stores whose owners treat potential customers to a preview of The-Big-Day.  When Rhonda is paralyzed by a spinal tumor, Muriel puts her dreams aside in order to care for her friend, al but resigned to the idea that she will never be a bride.  Fate steps in when the day comes that somebody pops her the question, and gives her the opportunity to complete the transformation into something she never thought she could be: married.In commercials, &#65533;Muriel&#65533; was pushed as a sort of dark comedy.  Instead, it&#65533;s rather dispiriting drama &#65533; the story of how Muriel will elevate herself from a life of emotional abuse into a fully-formed character.  Arrest, cancer and suicide punctuate the darker points of the story.  But the story is never gratuitously grim or sappy.  Muriel&#65533;s father is an ogre, and her mother flattened into timidity, but the story humanizes them both (him more than her, oddly enough).  The moral of the story is centered around Muriel and Rhonda, and whether Muriel will let her dreams of marriage get in the way of her friendship.  It&#65533;s a simple message, but the script and the players walk it well.  In short, if you loved &#65533;Strictly Ballroom&#65533; and anything by Peter Weir, you&#65533;ll love this flick.

Hogan's modern masterpiece, &quot;Muriel's Wedding&quot; serves up wedding cake with wheelchairs, confetti with cancer, ABBA with ardor, sweetness with stealing, and more importantly friends with foes in this one of a kind black comedy.&quot;Muriel's Wedding&quot; not only launched P.J. Hogan's directing and writing career but gave a leg up to Toni Collette who agreed to pack on 30 lbs. for the once in a lifetime role of Muriel Heslop,  citizen of small town Porpoise Spit, Australia. Rachel Griffiths from &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; also got her first shot playing Muriel's friend, wild child and general black sheep of Porpoise Spit, Rhonda Epinstalk.  Rhonda and Muriel escape the small town and small people of Porpoise Spit for the big city lights and acceptance of Sidney, Australia.A low self-esteemed wedding obsessed wannabe, Muriel lies, cheats and steals her way to her ultimate goal.  Getting HITCHED!  At least that's what Muriel thinks she desires, but all she wants is to truly be accepted by friends, family and her WHOLE world. Muriel's whole existence is based on &quot;Why Can't It Be Me?

It's something of a romance, but with a seriously edgy dark side to it.Basically, it's a story about a dysfunctional family and what it does to the people in it. It so thoroughly portrays the different roles of the dysfunctional family (and the ways in which personalities are warped by them) that I suspect the storywriter has some real experience with it. It seems like more than just story-telling.The film loses a star because of 1) some characterizations that are a little too &quot;out there&quot;, and 2) a lack of message (the &quot;better&quot; life that the movie portrays as freedom for Muriel is just as shallow as the one she's trapped in).These things aside, though, it's an engrossing story that is told uncannily well.",4,An idiosyncratic gem.,1005782400,"11 15, 2001",2001,852,"['great', 'movie', 'hard', 'classify', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'hilarious', 'not', 'really', 'comedy', 'something', 'romance', 'seriously', 'edgy', 'dark', 'side', 'it.Basically', 'story', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'what', 'people', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'different', 'roles', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'ways', 'personalities', 'are', 'warped', 'suspect', 'storywriter', 'real', 'experience', 'more', 'just', 'story-telling.The', 'film', 'star', '1', 'characterizations', 'are', 'little', 'too', 'quot', 'quot', '2', 'lack', 'message', 'quot', 'better', 'quot', 'life', 'movie', 'freedom', 'Muriel', 'just', 'as', 'shallow', 'one', 'trapped', '.These', 'things', 'aside', 'engrossing', 'story', 'told', 'uncannily', 'well']",N/A

The film begins at the wedding of one of the horrendous shallow women she thinks are her friends. She catches the bouquet but is firmly asked to hand it to someone else because, well, ""Who would ever want to marry you?"" Then she spots one of the bridesmaids shagging the groom in a back room. Then the police come round and arrest her for shop-lifting: the dress she is swearing appears to be stolen. Then it just keeps getting worse.This is just wonderful. It's a grotesquely dark comedy about everything that is grim and vicious and ugly and awful in human life. It's set in a world people by a gallery of magnificently drawn dysfunctional characters so vivid and perfectly realized it is one of very few films for which the adjective `Dickensian' is altogether apt. But while it's a comedy about some appallingly messed up people the comedy it is hugely compassionate and never cynical or cruel - at lest except when dealing with Muriel's unspeakable high School peer group, self-styled beautiful people, who, unlike all the other characters, show no sign of insecurity or self-doubt and are quite cruel enough themselves to be due a little cruelty in turn.Toni Colette's performance as Muriel has been widely praised to the skies and rightly - it's altogether perfect, very funny and very truthful. But every performance is superb: Bill Hunter and Jeanie Drynen as Muriel's very human but hopelessly failed parents; Gabby Millgate as her sister - she has almost no lines except repeated utterances of `You're terrible, Muriel' but she utters this so magnificently she steals her every scene; and Rachel Griffiths, magnificent and hilarious as Rhonda whose deep and genuine friendship is to be Muriel's salvation. The darkness of the comedy if perfectly judged. There are scenes so grim they don't really seem to belong in any sort of comedy and scenes that are impossibly, side-splittingly funny and the fit between the two is one of seamless harmony. And indeed, in many ways this is not such a dark film at all: it's an ultimately optimistic and unbeat - but entirely unsentimental - vision of the possibilities life may hold even for people who think, as Muriel does, that they are `useless' or `nothing'.",5,"A Sublime Comic Study of Inadequacy, Cancer and Suicide",1107993600,"02 10, 2005",2005,2425,"['Muriel', 'who', 'twenties', 'never', 'had', 'boyfriend', 'proper', 'job', 'miserable', 'Australian', 'small', 'town', 'Porpoise', 'Spit', 'life', 'bleakness', 'relieved', 'only', 'beloved', 'old', 'Abba', 'records', 'film', 'wedding', 'one', 'horrendous', 'shallow', 'women', 'thinks', 'are', 'friends', 'bouquet', 'firmly', 'asked', 'hand', 'someone', 'else', 'well', 'Who', 'would', 'ever', 'want', 'marry', 'Then', 'spots', 'one', 'bridesmaids', 'shagging', 'groom', 'back', 'room', 'Then', 'police', 'come', 'round', 'arrest', 'shop-lifting', 'dress', 'swearing', 'be', 'stolen', 'Then', 'just', 'getting', 'worse.This', 'just', 'wonderful', 'grotesquely', 'dark', 'comedy', 'everything', 'grim', 'vicious', 'ugly', 'awful', 'human', 'life', 'set', 'world', 'people', 'gallery', 'magnificently', 'drawn', 'dysfunctional', 'characters', 'so', 'vivid', 'perfectly', 'realized', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'adjective', 'Dickensian', 'altogether', 'apt', 'comedy', 'appallingly', 'messed', 'up', 'people', 'comedy', 'hugely', 'compassionate', 'never', 'cynical', 'cruel', 'lest', 'when', 'dealing', 'Muriel', 'unspeakable', 'high', 'School', 'peer', 'group', 'self-styled', 'beautiful', 'people', 'who', 'other', 'characters', 'show', 'sign', 'insecurity', 'self-doubt', 'are', 'quite', 'cruel', 'enough', 'be', 'due', 'little', 'cruelty', 'turn.Toni', 'Colette', 'performance', 'Muriel', 'been', 'widely', 'praised', 'skies', 'rightly', 'altogether', 'perfect', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'truthful', 'performance', 'superb', 'Bill', 'Hunter', 'Jeanie', 'Drynen', 'Muriel', 'very', 'human', 'hopelessly', 'failed', 'parents', 'Gabby', 'Millgate', 'sister', 'almost', 'lines', 'repeated', 'utterances', ""'re"", 'terrible', 'Muriel', 'so', 'magnificently', 'scene', 'Rachel', 'Griffiths', 'magnificent', 'hilarious', 'Rhonda', 'deep', 'genuine', 'friendship', 'be', 'Muriel', 'salvation', 'darkness', 'comedy', 'perfectly', 'judged', 'are', 'scenes', 'so', 'grim', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'belong', 'sort', 'comedy', 'scenes', 'are', 'impossibly', 'side-splittingly', 'funny', 'fit', 'two', 'one', 'seamless', 'harmony', 'indeed', 'many', 'ways', 'not', 'such', 'dark', 'film', 'ultimately', 'optimistic', 'unbeat', 'entirely', 'unsentimental', 'vision', 'possibilities', 'life', 'may', 'hold', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'Muriel', 'are', 'useless', 'nothing']",N/A

Perhaps it's the depressing old school clan who pick on Muriel that reminded me of similar occurrences.The movie depicts the Australian woman, Muriel, (Toni Collette) as a rather blah overweight women, stuck in the 80's, piddling behind the last of the popular school girls who quickly kick her out of the the group.  Depressed, she more or less swindles money from her family and follows the girls to a vacation island, only to bump into an old high school girl, Rhonda (Rachel Griffits) who recognizes her.  The two quickly become friends, after Rhonda completely tears the girls to shreds in one of the best verbal reads (cut downs) ever spoken.  It's the most hilarious part of the movie.The two girls become room mates, and their friendship grows...so does the fun, the antics, and even the seriousness and sadness of reality.  It's the reality of this movie that makes it so embracing.  Frankly, the fresh cast, as opposed to the typical movies with the same old faces, make this movie what it is.

Muriel is socially awkward but is still trying to get in with her high school attractive airhead set.  Needless to say they keep rejecting her and Muriel eventually escapes to Sydney to make it on her own.What really makes this film worth watching is the performance of Toni Collette who plays Muriel.  She does a great job in transforming Muriel from being dowdy to ending up being attractive.  The Australian elements include things like everyone drinking tea instead of coffee.  There is also a certain odd quality that appears in many Australian films.  Muriel's family is certainly odd with an aggressive father, a dowdy mother, and siblings who have no ambition because dad takes care of everything.There is also some unnecessary melodrama about Muriel's high school friend.
