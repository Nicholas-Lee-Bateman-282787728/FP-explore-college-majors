362707,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6303205364,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[3, 4]","Clifford (1994) was directed by Paul Flaherty, who also directed Who's Harry Crumb? (1989) and was a writer for SCTV, for which Martin Short appeared on, and also wrote for numerous other of Short's projects, finally sees a DVD release...sort of...the film stars Martin Short as the title character Clifford, a manipulative ten-year-old boy infatuated with dinosaurs and a theme park called Dinosaur World.  Charles Grodin plays Clifford's Uncle Martin, and Mary Steenburgen is Martin's fianc&eacute;e Sarah Davis.It seems Clifford's Uncle Martin and Sara are having problems in that Sara wants to start a family right away, but Martin doesn't seem serious about it.  Then Martin sees an opportunity to show Sara how great he is with children by taking in his nephew Clifford for a week.  Clifford, wanting to go to Dinosaur World so badly gets his Uncle Martin to promise to take him, but Uncle Martin must break the promise due to a deadline he must meet for his work.  This sets Clifford off in that he creates pranks, simple and elaborate, to get back at his uncle for lying to him.  You see, Clifford is extremely intelligent, cunning, obsessive, and pure evil, in the way a ten-year-old boy can be, especially one who doesn't get what he wants.The chemistry between Grodin and Short is really very good, the two battling wits and Grodin's character never quite realizing the depth of the boy's ruthlessness until it's too late.  Short is creepily convincing as a ten year old boy out for revenge for not getting what he wanted, basically ruining his uncle's personal and professional life in a few, short days.  There are a number of truly funny scenes and dialogue throughout the movie, and it's quite entertaining.  Grodin plays a role he has basically perfected over the years, a straight-laced character in unusual and exasperating situations.I was disappointed with this release in that it was only available in a full screen format.  Also, there was a notable lack of special features, the disc only containing a trailer for the film.  I wasn't looking for like ten hours of stuff, but maybe some production notes, or a look at some of Martin Shorts other projects.  Another reviewer has stated that some scenes are missing from the original release, but I am not sure if that is true as I haven't seen this film in a long time, but it does run 90 minutes which matches the what the IMDb has listed as a running time.Cookieman108",3,"""...a nightmare about your early days in the circus.""",1079136000,"03 13, 2004",2004,2441,"['Clifford', '1994', 'was', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Flaherty', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'Who', 'Harry', 'Crumb', '1989', 'was', 'writer', 'SCTV', 'Martin', 'Short', 'appeared', 'also', 'wrote', 'numerous', 'other', 'Short', 'projects', 'finally', 'DVD', 'release', 'sort', 'film', 'Martin', 'Short', 'title', 'character', 'Clifford', 'manipulative', 'ten-year-old', 'boy', 'infatuated', 'dinosaurs', 'theme', 'park', 'called', 'Dinosaur', 'World', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'Clifford', 'Uncle', 'Martin', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'Martin', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Sarah', 'Davis.It', 'Clifford', 'Uncle', 'Martin', 'Sara', 'are', 'having', 'problems', 'Sara', 'start', 'family', 'right', 'away', 'Martin', ""n't"", 'seem', 'serious', 'Then', 'Martin', 'opportunity', 'show', 'Sara', 'how', 'great', 'children', 'taking', 'nephew', 'Clifford', 'week', 'Clifford', 'wanting', 'go', 'Dinosaur', 'World', 'so', 'badly', 'Uncle', 'Martin', 'promise', 'take', 'Uncle', 'Martin', 'must', 'break', 'promise', 'due', 'deadline', 'must', 'meet', 'work', 'Clifford', 'off', 'pranks', 'simple', 'elaborate', 'get', 'back', 'uncle', 'lying', 'see', 'Clifford', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'cunning', 'obsessive', 'pure', 'evil', 'way', 'ten-year-old', 'boy', 'can', 'be', 'especially', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'wants.The', 'chemistry', 'Grodin', 'Short', 'really', 'very', 'good', 'two', 'battling', 'wits', 'Grodin', 'character', 'never', 'quite', 'realizing', 'depth', 'boy', 'ruthlessness', 'too', 'late', 'Short', 'creepily', 'convincing', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'revenge', 'not', 'getting', 'what', 'wanted', 'basically', 'ruining', 'uncle', 'personal', 'professional', 'life', 'few', 'short', 'days', 'are', 'number', 'truly', 'funny', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'Grodin', 'role', 'basically', 'perfected', 'years', 'straight-laced', 'character', 'unusual', 'exasperating', 'situations.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'release', 'was', 'only', 'available', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'Also', 'was', 'notable', 'lack', 'special', 'features', 'disc', 'only', 'containing', 'trailer', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'looking', 'ten', 'hours', 'stuff', 'maybe', 'production', 'notes', 'look', 'Martin', 'Shorts', 'other', 'projects', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'scenes', 'are', 'missing', 'original', 'release', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'true', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'run', '90', 'minutes', 'what', 'IMDb', 'listed', 'running', 'time.Cookieman108']",Clifford VHS

362709,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,6303205364,David Baldwin,"[0, 0]","""Clifford"" was ready for release in 1991 but it's distributor, Orion, was on the verge of bankruptcy.  Despite the box office and critical success of ""Dances With Wolves"" and with ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey"" in the can Orion made too many blunders.  Being Woody Allen's distributor probably didn't put any money in the coffers.  ""Love Field"" with Michelle Pfeiffer and this film collected dust until the court matters could be settled.  When ""Clifford"" was finally released theatrically in 1994 it was savaged by the critics and ignored by the public.  I never thought too much about this movie until a critic for ""Entertainment Weekly"" named it as a guilty pleasure.  By happenstance I came across the film at a local video store when they were liquidating their stock.  To be frank I was expecting ""Problem Child"" but ""Clifford"" is more akin to ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"".  Credit the comic mastery of Martin Short for finding within the rotten kid he is playing some endearing qualities.  It also helps that Short has great reparte with Charles Grodin as his harried Uncle Martin.  With those unfamiliar with Grodin it would behoove them to check out his work with Robert DeNiro in the underrated ""Midnight Run"".  Mary Steenburgen is wasted, though, in the stock girlfriend role.  Great script that has consistently funny gags and lines.  Why didn't this film find it's audience in 1994?  Probably because they marketed it as a family film which it definitely isn't because there are too many risque elements in it.

362713,A1BG88N69Q7W1S,6303205364,"imafunker2 ""miamiderek""","[1, 1]","This is one strange little film. A major flop when released in 1994 (after sitting on the shelf for 4 years), &#34;Clifford&#34; has garnered a bit of a cult following. One look at the plethora of rave reviews right here on Amazon acknowledges that fact. As much as I love the cast, I'm jealous that I just can't jump on the bandwagon. &#34;Clifford&#34; is assuredly not a good movie; but it's undeniably watchable and often entertaining.The by-the-numbers direction doesn't factor into that, nor does the bizarre script. Does Clifford (Martin Short) actually have a heart of gold under his Damien-like exterior? Does the film itself want to be a nasty, biting satire or a feel good family flick? It seems that nobody in charge of production knew those answers. However, that doesn't affect the comedic all-star cast. Short, famous for his sketch comedy talents seen on 'Saturday Night Live' and 'SCTV', plays a 10 year old brat who's too precocious for words...and has a destructive mean streak. The talented Mr. Short isn't everyone's cup of tea, admittedly; if you are a fan, you'll appreciate how he single-handedly creates an amusing character out of a poorly written script.Thankfully, &#34;Clifford&#34;'s producers got the casting part right. The best evidence of which is Short's co-star, that brilliant King of the Slow Burn, Charles Grodin. A few years before this was made, the far superior &#34;Midnight Run&#34; introduced Grodin to the masses. So instead of being a highly respected but somewhat neglected character actor, the majority of the country's film-goers were always ready and willing for some Chuck. &#34;Clifford&#34; is certainly no &#34;Heartbreak Kid&#34;, but any movie that casts the riotous Grodin in a starring role must have some brains behind the scenes. And as always, he's hilarious playing to type as the beleagured Uncle trying to deal with his horrific newly-arrived nephew. Mary Steenburgen has the relatively thankless role as Grodin's finacee, too dim to see the pitchfork and horns behind young Clifford's halo. She does as much as possible, though, and looks absolutely gorgeous. And as an always reliable safety valve, Dabney Coleman plays a variation of his usual persona: arrogant, salacious, wealthy, and likeable despite himself due to Coleman's skill and charisma.It's not possible for me to recommend &#34;Clifford&#34;; but if you find yourself up late, and it's starting up....why not?",2,No SHORTage of wacky hi-jinks...,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,2440,"['one', 'strange', 'little', 'film', 'major', 'flop', 'when', 'released', '1994', 'sitting', 'shelf', '4', 'years', '34', 'Clifford', '34', 'garnered', 'bit', 'cult', 'following', 'One', 'look', 'plethora', 'rave', 'reviews', 'right', 'here', 'Amazon', 'fact', 'As', 'much', 'love', 'cast', ""'m"", 'jealous', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'jump', 'bandwagon', '34', 'Clifford', '34', 'assuredly', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'undeniably', 'watchable', 'often', 'entertaining.The', 'by-the-numbers', 'direction', ""n't"", 'factor', 'bizarre', 'script', 'Does', 'Clifford', 'Martin', 'Short', 'actually', 'have', 'heart', 'gold', 'Damien-like', 'exterior', 'film', 'want', 'be', 'nasty', 'biting', 'satire', 'feel', 'good', 'family', 'flick', 'nobody', 'charge', 'production', 'knew', 'answers', 'However', ""n't"", 'affect', 'comedic', 'all-star', 'cast', 'Short', 'famous', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'talents', 'seen', ""'Saturday"", 'Night', 'Live', ""'SCTV"", '10', 'year', 'old', 'brat', 'who', 'too', 'precocious', 'words', 'destructive', 'mean', 'streak', 'talented', 'Mr.', 'Short', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'admittedly', 'are', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'how', 'single-handedly', 'amusing', 'character', 'poorly', 'written', 'script.Thankfully', '34', 'Clifford', '34', 'producers', 'got', 'casting', 'part', 'right', 'best', 'evidence', 'Short', 'co-star', 'brilliant', 'King', 'Slow', 'Burn', 'Charles', 'Grodin', 'A', 'few', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'far', 'superior', '34', 'Midnight', 'Run', '34', 'introduced', 'Grodin', 'masses', 'So', 'instead', 'being', 'highly', 'respected', 'somewhat', 'neglected', 'character', 'actor', 'majority', 'country', 'film-goers', 'were', 'always', 'ready', 'willing', 'Chuck', '34', 'Clifford', '34', 'certainly', '34', 'Heartbreak', 'Kid', '34', 'movie', 'riotous', 'Grodin', 'starring', 'role', 'must', 'have', 'brains', 'scenes', 'always', 'hilarious', 'playing', 'type', 'beleagured', 'Uncle', 'trying', 'deal', 'horrific', 'newly-arrived', 'nephew', 'Mary', 'Steenburgen', 'relatively', 'thankless', 'role', 'Grodin', 'finacee', 'too', 'dim', 'see', 'pitchfork', 'horns', 'young', 'Clifford', 'halo', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'though', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'always', 'reliable', 'safety', 'valve', 'Dabney', 'Coleman', 'variation', 'usual', 'persona', 'arrogant', 'salacious', 'wealthy', 'likeable', 'due', 'Coleman', 'skill', 'charisma.It', 'not', 'possible', 'recommend', '34', 'Clifford', '34', 'find', 'up', 'late', 'starting', 'up', 'not']",Clifford VHS

I suppose it's worth a glance, because it's never unwatchable, but damnit it just isn't very funny.I'm not a --huge-- fan of Martin Short but I do get a kick out of most of his antics, and considering myself a heterosexual male, I'll openly admit I don't think I've ever been attracted to a man as much as Charles Grodin (in a completely non-sexual way). Thus, it's that much more disheartening that this movie always works at barely working... It never crosses the line into complete debauchery, but it rides it with the type of hard-headed stubbornness Short's Clifford exudes.Grodin goes as psycho as he can in the midst of a demon child considering it's a PG rated flick (and it'd never get away with a PG rating these days... it's too twisted), and it's always mildly amusing, but their dynamic just isn't that funny, sad to say. Short's Clifford, likewise, is curiously nasty and perverse (with his obvious sexual fancy for Steenburgen -- just look at that face whenever he's around her), but his exuberance in bringing this unique spawn to fruition rarely hits the the funny mark.Maybe it's just me. Maybe it's not.  I'm a fan of most the people involved in this disaster, but none of their real strengths are overly apparent. Even still, while I readily admit I don't find 'Clifford' too much of a riot myself, I won't put those off who find it delectable... If nothing else, 'Clifford' is unique.

Paul ""John doe""","[0, 5]","Clifford made in 1990 set on the shelf at Orion until 1994 (cause of financial woes) it could've set on the shelf for 4 more millinums. This made North look Oscar worthy I want to know how this movie has a fan base cause it's not funny. It stars Charles Grodin as Uncle Marty, Martin Short as Clifford & Mary Steenburgen as Sarah. Let's talk about the plot shall we it opens up in the year 2050 Clifford tells this kid about when he was young how he made life a living f&ugrave;**n' h** for his Uncle Marty. Clifford's dad is going to Hawii for a business trip & this little s*!* causes the plane to somehow make an emergency landing in Los Angels & Clifford wants to stay with his Uncle Marty so he can go to Dinosaur World. Martin works as an Architect & something comes up & he can't take Clifford to Dinosaur World so he raises a lot of h3** to the point I want to help Charles Grodin beat the s#!* out of him. Like at a dinner hosted by Sarah's Dad he puts hot sauce in his drink & replaces his chapstick with lipstick & sets him up to be arrested Martin Short was on The $&uuml;t T@lour Cmpton level of being so annoying. He always make Uncle Marty look like a jerk & acts like a good kid around Sarah. He sends his Uncle Marty on a wild goose chase to San Fransisco & throws a party in his Uncle Marty's house & lies to Sarah some more & puts something in a disc that cause a explosion at a business presentation that gets him fired from his job all because he can't take him to Dinosaur World. Honestly Uncle Marty didn't seem like a bad guy he just couldn't take at the moment & Charles Grodin didn't do anything for 12 years. I liked him in the 2 Beethoveen movies back in the day but Charles Grodin couldn't save this. Marin Short was weird to look at at least JACK had a BS excuse. At least the Problem Child movies worked.Mary Steenburgen was kind of annoying. This movie got a theatrical release yet Army Of One which was released around the same time didn't. It gets a DVD release too & I Come In Peace doesn't A lot of Mark Dacascos films hae either been discontinued or have never  been put out on DVD. The same for Jeff Speakman's movies. This is cliche & there are a lot of movies I own have cliches but good directing & acting make any cliche script into a great movie.  Why was this movie called Clifford to fool kids into thinking it was about the dog. I'll admit I liked this movie when I saw it in 94 & I haven't seen it since 94 or 95 & I saw it again recently.

362719,A25RN8X70DSZLU,6303205364,JRP,"[1, 1]","I will be honest I liked this movie when I was kid I saw it in the theater even if it this movie holds up for you that's fine every movie has a fan & hater.  As an adult I think Clifford is pos & not funny at all which hurts the movie & I don't care for any of the characters except Charles Grodin. Same thing for an action movie or a horror movie if the movie doesn't get me involved it hurts the movie & when I dont' care about the characters I don't care about the movie. There is movies that I saw as kid & hold up most recently I reviewed Mighty Ducks & D2 The Mighty Ducks. Blank Check that I reviewed awhile ago still holds up The 1st 2 Ninja Turtles movies I reviewed them last year they hold up for me. This movie & North don't hold up which this movie is worse than North but I'll get to that pos movie later in the year. Orion I guess thought they could call the movie Clifford to fool parents into taking their kids to see it.  The promotion poster even said. ""What's the difference between Clifford & a Pit Bull? One will tear your heart out, scare your friends & wreck your house. The other is just a dog."" For a bit of trivia the movie was shot in 1990 & set on the shelf at Orion for 4 years. Cause Orion was in bad shape & were on the way out of going out of business. Clifford could've sat on shelf for 4 milleniums.  I couldn't find the budget info on this movie however it only made $7 million it had to have had at least a $20 million budget cause they had to do that Dinosaur ride at the end. It was directed by Paul Flarerty this is the only major movie he directed & I can see why. He's only directed TV specials for Billy Crystal other stuff like Mad TV & Blue Color TV which maybe he's more of a TV director cause I liked Blue Color TV ok it's not as good as the movies & I like Mad TV. Anyway the movie stars Charles Grodin as Martin Daniels, Martin Short as Clifford & Mary Steenburgen as Sarah Davis. The story is you start off in the year 2050 where this kid played by Ben Savage is trying to run away this old dude named Clifford who is a Priest tells him a long story of how he drove people absolutely batty. So you have a 40 year old playing a 10 year old & he doesn't even act like a 10 year old it made me feel uncomfortable it's just creepy I mean if they made up an excuse like in that movie Jack with Robin Williams I could buy but even then Clifford would be an annoying kid cause I actually cared about Robin Williams in that movie. His Dad is going to Hawaii on a business trip which Clifford drives his Dad insane he talks to his Dinosaur Toy like Al Snow talked to Head which that was actually funny. Ok so he takes his Wife & Son along so if he drives you insane why didn't you leave Clifford at home with The Old Lady & if he drives her insane then have her ship Clifford shipped off to an Asylum.  He's upsetting the passengers on this plane he shuts the engine down somehow causes them to land in LA cause he wants to go to Dinosaur World that's what this movie is about a very unlikable character driving Charles Grodin insane. So he wants to let his Uncle Martin take him to Dinosaur World which he agrees to it cause he wants to show his Girlfriend Sarah that he likes kids. I remember when I did a review back near 4 years ago on my older account I said Mary Steenburgen was kind of annoying no she really annoying I don't care for any of the characters except Charles Grodin & he works as an Architect he's designing a new Mass Transit System. So he picks Clifford up from The Air Port & he's stolen some of the people's stuff who were on the flight. So far not only has this character nearly killed everybody on The Plane but then he stole their stuff so he's a thief too. Martin introduces Clifford to his Girlfriend Sarah he butters up to her so anytime he does something bad he can make Martin look like the bad guy. Martin talks to his boss he tells him he has redesign the whole system in 2 days so he can't take Clifford to Dinosaur World from their he makes life a horrible for his Uncle Martin cause he can't take him to Dinosaur World I know we've all been there as kids not getting something we want but I didn't drive my Mom insane with practical jokes designed to run her life. Charles Grodin's character seems like a nice guy it's his boss that made him redesign his set up. Anyway he's screaming for chocolate so Martin stops at a Convince Store he's about to beat up this clerk meanwhile this boy goes to the bathroom he overhears from The Father they're going to Dinosaur World so Clifford follows him to the bathroom gives him his Uncle Martin's Money they switch clothes which is disturbing to think about cause Martin Short was 40 at the time. Anyway Martin finds out Clifford switched clothes with this kid & Clifford took that kids Dinosaur Costume he drags Clifford out of the Van this lady starts hitting Martin with her purse. My opinion hasn't changed I since I last saw this movie I still want to help Charles Grodin put the boots to Clifford. He grounds Clifford rightfully so cause Martin Daniels doesn't seem like a bad guy it was his boss that made him redesign his transportation system you know if they would've got a decent child actor & him going after Martin's Boss cause he's a pos it might have been a decent comedy.  Martin goes to this Anniversary for Sarah's Parents Clifford goes along Clifford puts hot sauce in Marin's drink replaces his chap stick with lipstick to embarrass him Not only that Clifford takes audio of Martin does a Michael Moore cut & paste job to make it sound like his Uncle has place a bomb at City Hall. Even after all that he lies to Sarah & tells her it was all a prank by a friend cause he loves her you know Martin let's Clifford off easy he wants him to write a confession to clear his name cause he has a record cause of Clifford. WTF IS SO FUNNY ABOUT THIS MOVIE!? I didn't laugh once the movie atrocious cause it's a comedy that's not funny & I don't care about any of the characters. Skipping ahead Clifford puts a picture of himself on a milk carton it says missing Martin says what have I done like it's Martin that's bad & he needs to change his ways. Anyway Martin goes to San Francisco but Clifford is still in LA so invites some kids at a party they wreck Martin's House Sarah's in San Francisco on a Business Trip with Martin's Boss he stops to chat with her he tells her how Clifford is being for him. She tells him he's phony & she can't spot phony & these 2 cross dressers ask for directions & she tells them she doesn't know. That's suppose to be funny the writers Dee Jay Rock Bobby Von Hayes I can see why this is the only thing you 2 have ever written. Martin gets home he finds Clifford tied up who said Biker's did it Martin locks him up in his room. The next morning Sarah comes to get Clifford & Martin's the bad buy when Martin gives his presentation of his model it blows up & he's fired so Clifford cost him his job. He take Clifford to Dinosaur World & it's closed for the night but he can get in anytime since he designed Larry The Scary Rex Ride. He makes Clifford ride it over & over again he keeps changing the speed until the machines all mess up & he has to save Clifford before he saves him he just stand there & says he's thinking about cause he doesn't know what he will do next. But when he save Clifford he apologizes Martin doesn't accept it cause he is beyond mad & I would be too. Basically it took 90 minutes for old man Martin Short how he was an evil kid & Ben Savage needs to straighten up. He tells him that Uncle Martin forgave him cause he was The Ring Bearer at Uncle Martin's Wedding he Married Sarah happily ever after. If you love this movie for whatever reason that's fine be my guest cause anytime I hate on a movie it's not against any of the fans it's against the movie & how I feel about it. My opinion is I think it's terrible it's a comedy that's not funny I didn't laugh 1 time & I don't care about the characters therefor I don't care about the movie cause the characters are annoying or plain unlikable. Charles Grodin is the only 1 who did a good job. A 40 year old playing a 10 year old isn't funny it's disturbing even if they made an excuse like in the movie Jack Martin Short would still be annoying & Mary Steenburgen was very annoying this time around. I don't mean to upset anybody who likes or loves this movie I'm only tearing the movie apart not the fan base.",1,20 years ago  rant Clifford 1/10,1396310400,"04 1, 2014",2014,8453,"['will', 'be',
