The cast is surprising in their diversity and the story is very well written.  No, it's not an evangelistic film.  Yes, it presents a positive message that would be easily enjoyed by both Christian and secular audiences.  My entire family enjoyed the film.",5,Inspiring and uplifting!,1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,329,"['Ultimately', 'film', 'God', 'provision', 'human', 'limitations', 'cast', 'surprising', 'diversity', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'No', 'not', 'evangelistic', 'film', 'Yes', 'positive', 'message', 'would', 'be', 'easily', 'enjoyed', 'Christian', 'secular', 'audiences', 'entire', 'family', 'enjoyed', 'film']",Brother White

After watching it, I can say that it was kind of okay to watch. I like faith-based movies but a lot of times the low budget and directing leads to a less than enjoyable film.  This one was probably slightly better than the average faith-based film.",2,The Preview Made Me think it Would be a Comedy,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,351,"['really', 'preview', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'Christian', 'comedy', 'watching', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'kind', 'okay', 'watch', 'faith-based', 'movies', 'lot', 'times', 'low', 'budget', 'directing', 'leads', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'one', 'was', 'probably', 'slightly', 'better', 'average', 'faith-based', 'film']",Brother White
1370436,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B003XDJEKS,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[1, 1]","James White (David A.R. White) works for a mega church in California under the rock-star preacher Johnny Kingman (Ray Wise). After making a few mistakes, James and his family is sent to an impoverished church in Atlanta that doesn't take to the mega-church way of preaching and wants something more personal. Logan White plays the wife, Lily White (ouch). Louisiana born Disney star Anna Margaret (not Brittany) plays the daughter Emma. The over grown Victoria Jackson has a small role as her career skids along the rocks.The all black church (there I said it) in Atlanta has financial problem as the bank manager (Rif Hutton with pointy ears) dressed in the evil colors of red and black will foreclose on the church to make room to build government subsidized housing, which is considered worse than building a liquor store. In order to save the church, White must pull out all the stops and reach out to people shunned by the community, to put together a benefit concert to save the church. Okay, not the most original plot out there. Delsey (NRaca) plays the secretary with a soft squeaky voice that was funny in ""Police Academy."" Senyo Amoaku plays EZ-8 the local street hustler with a secret. The always likeable Reginald VelJohnson is the church deacon. BeBe Winans does sing, but his song is interrupted by the unfolding movie drama.The film ends as expected. The Christian theme is light, that God sometimes speaks to us in whispers. The film feels like it is a mega-church production, the same thing that it is being critical about.Family Friendly.",3,YOU ARE WHAT YOU LIMIT YOURSELF TO BE,1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,1557,"['James', 'White', 'David', 'A.R', 'White', 'mega', 'church', 'California', 'rock-star', 'preacher', 'Johnny', 'Kingman', 'Ray', 'Wise', 'making', 'few', 'mistakes', 'James', 'family', 'sent', 'impoverished', 'church', 'Atlanta', ""n't"", 'take', 'mega-church', 'way', 'preaching', 'something', 'more', 'personal', 'Logan', 'White', 'wife', 'Lily', 'White', 'ouch', 'Louisiana', 'born', 'Disney', 'star', 'Anna', 'Margaret', 'not', 'Brittany', 'daughter', 'Emma', 'grown', 'Victoria', 'Jackson', 'small', 'role', 'career', 'skids', 'rocks.The', 'black', 'church', 'said', 'Atlanta', 'financial', 'problem', 'bank', 'manager', 'Rif', 'Hutton', 'pointy', 'ears', 'dressed', 'evil', 'colors', 'red', 'black', 'will', 'foreclose', 'church', 'make', 'room', 'build', 'government', 'subsidized', 'housing', 'considered', 'worse', 'building', 'liquor', 'store', 'order', 'save', 'church', 'White', 'must', 'pull', 'out', 'stops', 'reach', 'out', 'people', 'shunned', 'community', 'put', 'together', 'benefit', 'concert', 'save', 'church', 'Okay', 'not', 'most', 'original', 'plot', 'there', 'Delsey', 'NRaca', 'secretary', 'soft', 'squeaky', 'voice', 'was', 'funny', 'Police', 'Academy', 'Senyo', 'Amoaku', 'EZ-8', 'local', 'street', 'hustler', 'secret', 'always', 'likeable', 'Reginald', 'VelJohnson', 'church', 'deacon', 'BeBe', 'Winans', 'sing', 'song', 'interrupted', 'unfolding', 'movie', 'drama.The', 'film', 'expected', 'Christian', 'theme', 'light', 'God', 'sometimes', 'whispers', 'film', 'feels', 'mega-church', 'production', 'same', 'thing', 'being', 'critical', 'about.Family', 'Friendly']",Brother White
