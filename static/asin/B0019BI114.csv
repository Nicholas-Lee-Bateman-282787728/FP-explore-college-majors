Boasting several of the greatest episodes, it's in many ways the most entertaining season of THAT GIRL.  This year kicks off with a fun 2-part episode entitled ""Mission Improbable"", in which the owner of a pyjama design factory (Lou Jacobi) asks Ann Marie (Marlo Thomas) to go undercover as a seamstress in a rival company, complete with a banana camera!In ""Nobody Here But Us Chickens"", Ann is cast as the mascot for Chicken Big, a fast-food chain, but doesn't count on the romantic advances of the Colonel Sanders-esque chairman.  ""The Snow Must Go On"" is a real charmer, in which Ann, Donald (Ted Bessell) and her parents (Lew Parker and Rosemary DeCamp) find themselves stuck at a snowbound Kennedy Airport.  Frantic Ann must think fast and winds up auditioning on-camera for the role of a man-eating temptress named Mary Thatcher during the news coverage; whilst her father squirrels away 40 ham sandwiches in an airport luggage locker!There is also the lavish 2-part special ""She Never Had the Vegas Notion"", in which Ann wins a supporting role in a Sin City show starring Marty Haines (Jack Cassidy), a womanising prankster who decides to use the trip to play an extended joke on Donald... and almost ruins his relationship with Ann!Through it all, there is the delightful Marlo Thomas, dressed to the nines in delicious Cardinali fashions.  There's never been a lovelier GIRL.  This set includes all 26 episodes from the fourth season.  Special features are, disappointingly, not included at all, whereas the last three seasons came with some very enjoyable extras.Episodes:Mission Improbable (Parts 1 & 2)My Part Belongs to DaddyNobody Here But Us ChickensAt the Drop of a BudgetHearing Today, Gone TomorrowThe Snow Must Go OnWrite is WrongShake Hands and Come Out ActingFix My Screen and Bug OutKiss That Girl GoodbyeShe Never Had the Vegas Notion (Parts 1 & 2)I Am a Curious LemonTen Percent of Nothing is NothingOpening NightThat Meter MaidFly By NightUgh WildernessStocks and the Single GirlThe Night They Raided Daddy'sThe Reunion (aka Stag Party)Gone-a-Courtin'They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?Easy FallerAll's Well That Ends",4,"The last great year of ""That Girl""",1358208000,"01 15, 2013",2013,2214,"['fourth', 'season', 'THAT', 'GIRL', 'really', 'last', 'great', 'year', 'show', 'Boasting', 'several', 'greatest', 'episodes', 'many', 'ways', 'most', 'entertaining', 'season', 'GIRL', 'year', 'off', 'fun', '2-part', 'episode', 'entitled', 'Mission', 'Improbable', 'owner', 'pyjama', 'design', 'factory', 'Lou', 'Jacobi', 'Ann', 'Marie', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'go', 'undercover', 'seamstress', 'rival', 'company', 'complete', 'banana', 'camera', 'Nobody', 'Here', 'Us', 'Chickens', 'Ann', 'cast', 'mascot', 'Chicken', 'Big', 'fast-food', 'chain', ""n't"", 'count', 'romantic', 'advances', 'Colonel', 'Sanders-esque', 'chairman', 'Snow', 'Must', 'Go', 'real', 'charmer', 'Ann', 'Donald', 'Ted', 'Bessell', 'parents', 'Lew', 'Parker', 'Rosemary', 'DeCamp', 'find', 'stuck', 'snowbound', 'Kennedy', 'Airport', 'Frantic', 'Ann', 'must', 'think', 'fast', 'up', 'auditioning', 'on-camera', 'role', 'man-eating', 'temptress', 'named', 'Mary', 'Thatcher', 'news', 'coverage', 'father', 'squirrels', 'away', '40', 'ham', 'sandwiches', 'airport', 'luggage', 'locker', 'also', 'lavish', '2-part', 'special', 'Never', 'Had', 'Vegas', 'Notion', 'Ann', 'supporting', 'role', 'Sin', 'City', 'show', 'starring', 'Marty', 'Haines', 'Jack', 'Cassidy', 'womanising', 'prankster', 'who', 'use', 'trip', 'play', 'extended', 'joke', 'Donald', 'almost', 'relationship', 'Ann', 'delightful', 'Marlo', 'Thomas', 'dressed', 'nines', 'delicious', 'Cardinali', 'fashions', 'never', 'been', 'lovelier', 'GIRL', 'set', '26', 'episodes', 'fourth', 'season', 'Special', 'features', 'are', 'disappointingly', 'not', 'included', 'last', 'three', 'seasons', 'came', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'extras.Episodes', 'Mission', 'Improbable', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'Part', 'Belongs', 'DaddyNobody', 'Here', 'Us', 'ChickensAt', 'Drop', 'BudgetHearing', 'Today', 'Gone', 'TomorrowThe', 'Snow', 'Must', 'Go', 'OnWrite', 'WrongShake', 'Hands', 'Come', 'Out', 'ActingFix', 'My', 'Screen', 'Bug', 'OutKiss', 'That', 'Girl', 'GoodbyeShe', 'Never', 'Had', 'Vegas', 'Notion', 'Parts', '1', '2', 'Am', 'Curious', 'LemonTen', 'Percent', 'Nothing', 'NothingOpening', 'NightThat', 'Meter', 'MaidFly', 'NightUgh', 'WildernessStocks', 'Single', 'GirlThe', 'Night', 'Raided', ""Daddy'sThe"", 'Reunion', 'aka', 'Stag', 'Party', ""Gone-a-Courtin'They"", 'Shoot', 'Pictures', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Easy', 'FallerAll', 'Well', 'Ends']",That Girl Season 4

On the plus side, the episodes are in good condition and season four has plenty of episodes that are worth watching. In a two parter, Ann Marie and Donald go to Las Vegas. The neon lights, gambling, booze and carefree atmosphere of Las Vegas brings out Donald's nasty side! In another episode, Ann Marie goes undercover in a sweatshop. In another episode, Ann has to wear a cheesy, garish chicken costume to promote a fried chicken franchise. I like her comments on the chicken costume(""I thought this outfit would be more Las Vegas and less Disneyland""). One episode recaps scenes from season one such as Donald meeting Ann Marie in an office building for the first time.

This show was a lot of the same thing year after year. Some episodes aren't worth the time watching more than once. It has a certain charm to it, but Ann, Donald, and especially Mr. Marie can really get on my nerves at times. I'm hoping Season Five is the best because I plan on purchasing that as well, may as well complete the series.If ""Ann Marie"" was an actress why did she always look the same in every episode and stuck to Donald 4 years without an engagement ring! Lose the old fashioned hairdo already!! And the apartment was really boring. It was 1969-70, the writers could have made this show a lot more interesting than it was. Thank God for the Mary Tyler Moore show!! She really turned the world on. Ann Marie was like Mary's younger sister who could have used some good advice. Did Ann Marie even have any friends?
