I had forgotten what a great physical comic timing Danny Kaye had. Steve was a big surprise too--usually the bad guy, tough cop or misfit, he was really funny in the role of the boxer who kept being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Virginia Mayo was lovely as always--Vera Ellen a dynamo dancer, Danny Kaye at his best and Steve going with the flow. All in all, a funny movie with beautiful people, sadly, all no longer with us.
