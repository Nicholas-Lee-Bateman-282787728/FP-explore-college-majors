The camera (filming the movie) was a little weird at times with the angles but maybe the budget was low...and they kept showing this pink/purple plastic flower during the movie which was weird. Otherwise, I am giving a decent rating because I have not seen any other movies with this storyline...I think this would make a better book than movie.

1460057,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005GHIK18,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[23, 23]","Despite its obvious budgetary constraints, writer/director Ryan Richmond serves up a surprisingly complex and ambitious narrative in ""Money Matters.""  Knowing nothing at all about the film, I went into the experience a complete blank with little expectation.  And while the movie is far from perfect, it has a reach, intimacy, and sophistication that made me want to overlook any apparent shortcomings.  In a story that has elements of coming-of-age drama, family dysfunction, cautionary tale, and redemptive morality play--this little ninety minute presentation attempts more than you might anticipate.  In fact, there is enough significant content to fuel several different projects.  Sometimes the film pushes a bit too hard (I probably could have lived without the dramatic illness that takes over the film's finale), but I will never fault a filmmaker that has too many ideas and ambitions in this world of empty-headed movie making by committee.At the heart of the picture is a strong and complicated mother/daughter dynamic.  Aunjanue Ellis (getting a chance to shine) plays the mother, a troubled soul dealing with abusive relationships and a sordid past that was populated with drug use and prostitution.  Still fighting every day, she has been committed to giving her daughter (Terri Abney) a better opportunity than she had.  Abney plays Monique ""Money"" Matters and it is one of the more complex portraits of adolescence that you're likely to see.  Introspective and socially awkward, Abney has a defiant but loving relationship with her mother (who has turned to a religious mania in the search for strength).  But her primary journey is one of self-discovery, just who is she and where does she fit in?  As Abney starts to be pushed by teachers and a new bond with a local girl, her independence and confidence start to shine.  But as unsavory elements that haunt the two women's past start to surface, Abney must confront some unpleasant truths.  Can these realizations set her free or might they destroy her?Although filled with great ideas, the dialogue (as I mentioned) can sometimes feel a bit forced or stilted.  Ultimately, though, there is no denying the power and emotion behind the piece.  Ellis has a meaty role and she really attacks the disparate emotions behind it.  Abney is allowed a quieter, more subtle approach.  As her strength emerges gradually, you're invested in her journey.  This mother/daughter bond is one of the primary reasons to watch ""Money Matters.""  Ryan Richmond seems to have a great instinct and if this showcase is any indication, I expect to see more of this talented filmmaker.  A strong contemporary urban drama, I hope this little film can find a wide audience on DVD.  This is for viewers looking for complicated and rewarding storytelling outside of traditional mainstream cinema.

Girls kissing girls without shame, calling your mom by her first name; basically raising yourself with your own morals. This was a big mess of stuff for me. While it's quite engaging, I was watching with my daughter and we were both disgusted by so many things but continued watching and both agreed that it was a sad, sad story for this child trying to find her place in this world with a mom that should have been reported to DHS at the very least. So many sad stories of children these days! I suppose the story needed telling but perhaps a little less drama; but would it be compelling enough to sell? Mixed feelings but very sad situation for the daughter. It hinted on what might be her future, but, it would have been nicer to have actually known what would happen after her mom and 'dad' 'left'.

Money lives with her single mother. She doesn't know her real father, although we, the audience find out midway. Mom sends her to Catholic school because she wants her daughter to have a chance in this world. Life is at the point where Mom (Aunjanue Ellis) realizes she must change her pot smoking, loser boyfriend life in order to prevent her daughter from emulating her. Money has two girlfriends. One attends Catholic school with her. She (London K. Powell) keeps her boyfriends happy with oral sex. The other girl (Victoria Wallace)goes to public school and can't read. She likes Money and prefers girls to boys. Money prays to God to be normal. She escapes life through her tough life poetry which we get to hear from time to time.There is also a subplot involving a priest(James Whalen) at the local hospital who likes women too much.Washington DC is in the background scene, I assume that is the location. The movie is well scripted and well acted by a group of virtual unknowns. What is nice about this gritty African-American urban story is that it doesn't involve gangs or 50 Cent. Mom tries to restore her faith and instill faith in her daughter. She is sick (we find out midway what she has) and believes her days are numbered. Her daughter Money is all that matters to her and life doesn't come easy. 5 star story of despair and hope.F-bomb, n-word, sex talk, brief sex, no nudity.",5,"IF THY EYE OFFEND THEE, PLUCK IT OUT",1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,1488,"['Terri', 'Abney', 'Monique', 'Matters', 'nickname', 'Money', 'inner', 'city', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'Money', 'single', 'mother', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'father', 'audience', 'find', 'out', 'midway', 'Mom', 'Catholic', 'school', 'daughter', 'have', 'chance', 'world', 'Life', 'point', 'where', 'Mom', 'Aunjanue', 'Ellis', 'must', 'change', 'pot', 'smoking', 'loser', 'boyfriend', 'life', 'order', 'prevent', 'daughter', 'emulating', 'Money', 'two', 'girlfriends', 'One', 'Catholic', 'school', 'London', 'K.', 'Powell', 'boyfriends', 'happy', 'oral', 'sex', 'other', 'girl', 'Victoria', 'Wallace', 'public', 'school', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'Money', 'prefers', 'girls', 'boys', 'Money', 'God', 'be', 'normal', 'life', 'tough', 'life', 'poetry', 'get', 'hear', 'time', 'time.There', 'also', 'subplot', 'involving', 'priest', 'James', 'Whalen', 'local', 'hospital', 'who', 'women', 'too', 'much.Washington', 'DC', 'background', 'scene', 'assume', 'location', 'movie', 'well', 'scripted', 'well', 'acted', 'group', 'virtual', 'unknowns', 'What', 'nice', 'gritty', 'African-American', 'urban', 'story', ""n't"", 'involve', 'gangs', '50', 'Cent', 'Mom', 'restore', 'faith', 'instill', 'faith', 'daughter', 'sick', 'find', 'out', 'midway', 'what', 'days', 'are', 'numbered', 'daughter', 'Money', 'matters', 'life', ""n't"", 'come', 'easy', '5', 'star', 'story', 'despair', 'hope.F-bomb', 'n-word', 'sex', 'talk', 'brief', 'sex', 'nudity']",Money Matters
