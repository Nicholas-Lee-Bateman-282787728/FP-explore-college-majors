910654,A1CMAK5IPJRK0L,B0009PVZK0,"Cat ""hopeless-anglophile""","[35, 36]","I've seen many versions of Great Expectations and I think Director Julian Amyes hit the mark on this one. I wasn't too pleased with his version of 'The Old Curiosity Shop,' so I approached Great Expectations with some hesitancy. Like many of Amyes' productions, the strength of his theatre trained actors carry the show. The cast in ""Expectations"" was exceptional-especially Gerry Sundquist as Pip and Stratford Johns as Magwitch. Joan Hickson is also incredible as the jilted bride, Miss Havisham. Some of the negative reviews on this page point to the length of this production. I watched this entire series in two nights and didn't find it excessively long. In fact, it was edited quite well and at the end of each episode there was an appropriate amount of suspense. Despite it's length, the story is easy to follow especially if you're not familiar with this tale. In a nutshell, it concerns Pip, a young boy of low birth who suddenly finds his wish to be a gentleman fulfilled with the aid of a secret benefactor. There are many themes but none as important as social division, revenge, and the consequences of subterfuge. Dickens is a master of finding intricate and clever ways to intertwine his characters and make even the most insignificant person become vastly important to his stories. This series has immense value and it's unfortunate it has been reviewed so negatively simply because it was filmed in segments and it was ""too bleak."" Please. Bleakness was part of Dickens' world, but, as with 'Expectations,"" his characters experience redemption, transformation, and justice for the oppressed.",5,"Finally, the best adaptation of a Dickens' classic",1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,1609,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'versions', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'think', 'Director', 'Julian', 'Amyes', 'hit', 'mark', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'pleased', 'version', ""'The"", 'Old', 'Curiosity', 'Shop', 'so', 'approached', 'Great', 'Expectations', 'hesitancy', 'many', 'Amyes', 'productions', 'strength', 'theatre', 'trained', 'actors', 'carry', 'show', 'cast', 'Expectations', 'was', 'exceptional-especially', 'Gerry', 'Sundquist', 'Pip', 'Stratford', 'Johns', 'Magwitch', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'also', 'incredible', 'jilted', 'bride', 'Miss', 'Havisham', 'negative', 'reviews', 'page', 'point', 'length', 'production', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'two', 'nights', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'excessively', 'long', 'fact', 'was', 'edited', 'quite', 'well', 'end', 'episode', 'was', 'appropriate', 'amount', 'suspense', 'length', 'story', 'easy', 'follow', 'especially', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'tale', 'nutshell', 'Pip', 'young', 'boy', 'low', 'birth', 'who', 'suddenly', 'wish', 'be', 'gentleman', 'fulfilled', 'aid', 'secret', 'benefactor', 'are', 'many', 'themes', 'none', 'as', 'important', 'social', 'division', 'revenge', 'consequences', 'subterfuge', 'Dickens', 'master', 'finding', 'intricate', 'clever', 'ways', 'intertwine', 'characters', 'make', 'even', 'most', 'insignificant', 'person', 'become', 'vastly', 'important', 'stories', 'series', 'immense', 'value', 'unfortunate', 'been', 'reviewed', 'so', 'negatively', 'simply', 'was', 'filmed', 'segments', 'was', 'too', 'bleak', 'Please', 'Bleakness', 'was', 'part', 'Dickens', 'world', ""'Expectations"", 'characters', 'experience', 'redemption', 'transformation', 'justice', 'oppressed']",Great Expectations
910655,A23UB49EG29MVT,B0009PVZK0,Commenter77,"[1, 2]","Very pleased with this adaptation, recently viewed.  It has pushed out my former preference, the 1946 John Mills/Simmons/Hobson version, though that one has merits.  The Gillian Anderson version left me cold with its inventive, spooky bent stylizing.  This is it so far.  Was pleased with casting, considering Joan Hickson, yes, older than others featured elsewhere, but appropriate to the book type and faithful in execution.  She is a good actress, and I'm glad she finally came into appreciation with her Miss Marple and subsequent parts such as this.Personally, I liked the adult Pip, finding him sensitive when needed, yet showing the requisite callousness when he was in those throes.  However, I did not like the length of the handling of his burn injury and interaction with Magwitch at the end, which I felt were over extended.  This Herbert was super, truer than true, authentic and credible as such.  Otherwise, all other castings were competent, though the Jaggers character received more detailed and extended interaction than I recall from the book.  The Wemmick here brought amusement, as I recognized him from the Sherlock Holmes series of the `80s, who was Inspector LeStrade in that. On a light note:  I think I've seen enough of side whiskers for a while. :)This version brought some elements into clearer focus and comprehension, and the length was appreciated because it was so enjoyable and well done.  I consider this a fine depiction of the classic, one of my Dickens favorites, and would recommend it to any and all.",5,Enjoyable Adaptation - New Favorite,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,1541,"['Very', 'pleased', 'adaptation', 'recently', 'viewed', 'pushed', 'out', 'former', 'preference', '1946', 'John', 'Mills/Simmons/Hobson', 'version', 'one', 'merits', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'version', 'left', 'cold', 'inventive', 'spooky', 'bent', 'stylizing', 'so', 'far', 'Was', 'pleased', 'casting', 'considering', 'Joan', 'Hickson', 'yes', 'older', 'others', 'featured', 'elsewhere', 'appropriate', 'book', 'type', 'faithful', 'execution', 'good', 'actress', ""'m"", 'glad', 'finally', 'came', 'appreciation', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'subsequent', 'parts', 'such', 'this.Personally', 'liked', 'adult', 'Pip', 'finding', 'sensitive', 'when', 'needed', 'yet', 'showing', 'requisite', 'callousness', 'when', 'was', 'throes', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'length', 'handling', 'burn', 'injury', 'interaction', 'Magwitch', 'end', 'felt', 'were', 'over', 'extended', 'Herbert', 'was', 'super', 'truer', 'true', 'authentic', 'credible', 'such', 'Otherwise', 'other', 'castings', 'were', 'competent', 'Jaggers', 'character', 'received', 'more', 'detailed', 'extended', 'interaction', 'recall', 'book', 'Wemmick', 'here', 'brought', 'amusement', 'recognized', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'series', '80s', 'who', 'was', 'Inspector', 'LeStrade', 'light', 'note', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'side', 'whiskers', 'while', 'version', 'brought', 'elements', 'clearer', 'focus', 'comprehension', 'length', 'was', 'appreciated', 'was', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'done', 'consider', 'fine', 'depiction', 'classic', 'one', 'Dickens', 'favorites', 'would', 'recommend']",Great Expectations

Mr. Dickens married his wife Catherine in 1836. They were married 21-years; during which he wrote his great novels: ""Oliver Twist""-1839, ""A Christmas Carol""-1843, and ""David Copperfield""-1850. Mr. Dickens left his wife and mother of ten children, about 1857.Unlike ""Great Expectations"", Mr. Dickens's great novels follow a high-minded thought; balance with moments of cheer, triumph for the main character, adventure, and interesting characters. A novel is not a classic just because it is: old, assigned by your English teacher, or written by the writer of other novels indeed brilliant. ""Great Expectations"" has portions which show Mr. Dickens's ability; however overall it lacks the charm and elements that make his other stories great, true, enjoyable, classics.This 1981-version has a better first episode than the 1999-version; but then drags painfully; wearing the viewer out. Too much time on the dreary. The 1999-version leaves you empty in the end. The 1947-version of ""Great Expectations"" is best; with John Mills, father of Haley Mills.
