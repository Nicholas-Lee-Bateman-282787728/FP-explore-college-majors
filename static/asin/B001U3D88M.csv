1238215,AK0CENM3LUM28,B001U3D88M,Amazon Customer,"[31, 52]","Dragon Hunters / B001U3D88M""Dragon Hunters"" feels like the sort of film you would get if you gave a rather large budget to a bunch of animation film school grad students and told them to go nuts. It's very pretty, but there's only a skeleton of a story to hang onto, and the ""comedy"" is never funny and often disturbing.Let's drill into the comedy first, and get it out of the way: there isn't any. Nearly all of the ""comedy"" is in the form of body jokes of a strangely suggestive nature - the blind king, when sizing up a potential warrior, isn't convinced of his manliness until he has had a chance to handle the warrior's package. This really isn't, ah, plot relevant, so why was it included here? The stick held over the heroes' heads to get them to complete their mission isn't jail time or anything so mundane - no, it's the threat that if they refuse to complete their mission, they will be ""spanked"" by the king, in public, on their ""bare bottom"". This point is stressed, frequently. At the end, the ""plucky"" girl on the team is threatened with this fate and she is ""saved"" by another, male character being punished in this manner in her place. Seriously, there is a LOT of screen time devoted to discussions of public spankings.There's also an animal side-kick whose only purpose is to pee little spouts of fire.The rest of the ""comedy"" is meant to come from the quirky comic relief character, Gwizdo, here voiced by Rob Paulsen, ofPinky and the Brainfame. You may remember Pinky as having a voice pitched so high and so annoyingly as to give Jar Jar Binks a run for his money. If so, your memory does not deceive you. Because this is a dark! and edgy! film, Gwizdo is a con-man who has no intention of following through on their contract to save the kingdom, but does so anyway because of the Bonds of Friendship. This does not, however, prevent him from going crazy and threatening to strangle a little girl with his bare hands. I digress, though - much of the ""humor"" involves him hoping up and down and screaming in a voice scientifically designed to burst my eardrums that He Does Not Want To Make This Journey. This gets old, fast.Indeed, I say that much of the humor involves Gwizdo's protestations, but it would be more accurate to say that most of the entire movie centers around this. This really is the most watered-down plot I've seen in awhile: an ancient evil is preparing to wake and ravage the populace, and our heroes are hired to go to his ancient sleeping place and stab him a few times for good measure. They walk there, through a number of surprisingly lovely yet ultimately pointless, worlds; arrive with no strategy in mind; and pull an unlikely win out of their hair, largely because the hero's family was destroyed by the monster when he was a child, and having him kill it is more poetic. Then they all go back home and Gwizdo gets spanked. That is IT. Along the way, there's no story, no plot, just lovely backgrounds and Gwizdo whining at a rate of four complaints per minute.If you have a specific need to hear Rob Paulsen talk about being spanked in public, ""Dragon Hunters"" is for you, but if you'd like a story with your plot, run away as fast as you can.~ Ana Mardoll",1,"Animation without Story, ""Comedy"" without Humor",1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,3209,"['Dragon', 'Hunters', '/', 'B001U3D88M', 'Dragon', 'Hunters', 'feels', 'sort', 'film', 'would', 'get', 'gave', 'rather', 'large', 'budget', 'bunch', 'animation', 'film', 'school', 'grad', 'students', 'told', 'go', 'nuts', 'very', 'pretty', 'only', 'skeleton', 'story', 'hang', 'comedy', 'never', 'funny', 'often', 'disturbing.Let', 'drill', 'comedy', 'first', 'get', 'way', ""n't"", 'Nearly', 'comedy', 'form', 'body', 'jokes', 'strangely', 'suggestive', 'nature', 'blind', 'king', 'when', 'sizing', 'up', 'potential', 'warrior', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'manliness', 'had', 'chance', 'handle', 'warrior', 'package', 'really', ""n't"", 'ah', 'plot', 'relevant', 'so', 'why', 'was', 'included', 'here', 'stick', 'held', 'heroes', 'heads', 'get', 'complete', 'mission', ""n't"", 'jail', 'time', 'anything', 'so', 'mundane', 'threat', 'refuse', 'complete', 'mission', 'will', 'be', 'spanked', 'king', 'public', 'bare', 'bottom', 'point', 'stressed', 'frequently', 'end', 'plucky', 'girl', 'team', 'threatened', 'fate', 'saved', 'male', 'character', 'being', 'punished', 'manner', 'place', 'Seriously', 'LOT', 'screen', 'time', 'devoted', 'discussions', 'public', 'spankings.There', 'also', 'animal', 'side-kick', 'only', 'purpose', 'pee', 'little', 'spouts', 'fire.The', 'rest', 'comedy', 'meant', 'come', 'quirky', 'comic', 'relief', 'character', 'Gwizdo', 'here', 'voiced', 'Rob', 'Paulsen', 'ofPinky', 'Brainfame', 'may', 'remember', 'Pinky', 'having', 'voice', 'pitched', 'so', 'high', 'so', 'annoyingly', 'give', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', 'run', 'money', 'so', 'memory', 'not', 'deceive', 'dark', 'edgy', 'film', 'Gwizdo', 'con-man', 'who', 'intention', 'following', 'contract', 'save', 'kingdom', 'so', 'anyway', 'Bonds', 'Friendship', 'not', 'however', 'prevent', 'going', 'crazy', 'threatening', 'strangle', 'little', 'girl', 'bare', 'digress', 'much', 'humor', 'hoping', 'up', 'down', 'screaming', 'voice', 'scientifically', 'designed', 'burst', 'eardrums', 'Not', 'Want', 'Make', 'Journey', 'old', 'fast.Indeed', 'say', 'much', 'humor', 'Gwizdo', 'protestations', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'say', 'most', 'entire', 'movie', 'centers', 'really', 'most', 'watered-down', 'plot', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'awhile', 'ancient', 'evil', 'preparing', 'wake', 'ravage', 'populace', 'heroes', 'are', 'hired', 'go', 'ancient', 'sleeping', 'place', 'stab', 'few', 'times', 'good', 'measure', 'walk', 'there', 'number', 'surprisingly', 'lovely', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'pointless', 'worlds', 'arrive', 'strategy', 'mind', 'pull', 'unlikely', 'win', 'hair', 'largely', 'hero', 'family', 'was', 'destroyed', 'monster', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'having', 'kill', 'more', 'poetic', 'Then', 'go', 'back', 'home', 'Gwizdo', 'spanked', 'IT', 'way', 'story', 'plot', 'just', 'lovely', 'backgrounds', 'Gwizdo', 'whining', 'rate', 'four', 'complaints', 'minute.If', 'have', 'specific', 'need', 'hear', 'Rob', 'Paulsen', 'talk', 'being', 'spanked', 'public', 'Dragon', 'Hunters', ""'d"", 'like', 'story', 'plot', 'run', 'away', 'as', 'fast', 'can.~', 'Ana', 'Mardoll']",Dragon Hunters

However, despite some eerie similarities in world construction, this turns out to be one of the BEST computer animated films ever made, one I can recommend without hesitation.To begin with the world ofDragon Huntersis simply gorgeous, a world of islands floating around in the sky, upon which gravity works oddly when it works at all.  But this beautiful world is threatened to varying degrees by the dragons of the title, which range in degree of threat from annoying crop stealers to terrifying world devourers, thus the necessity for hunters of same.Twenty years ago Lord Arnold lost his sight and his health trying to stop the World Gobbler's last rampage, now he impatiently and all but hopelessly awaits the return of the knights he dispatched to try and stop his pending rampage.  So his fairy tale loving niece, Zoe, decides to lend a hand by sneaking out and finding some noble knights like those in her fairy tales, but what she finds are our two hapless heroes.  Can a little girl's belief in them inspire a couple of two-bit, fly-by-night, down-on-their-luck dragon hunters into succeeding where a troop of noble knights failed, into stopping the most horrifying dragon this world has ever seen?Well, the answer is obvious, but the fun is in how we get there.Gwizdo and Lian-Chu make for a hilariously mismatched pair, whose widely differing reactions to Zoe, the dragon hunter groupie who is not quite as naive as she appears, threaten to tear their partnership apart,...assuming of course that anyone survives this fiasco.Note: Some retailers package this DVD with a free Dragon Hunters comic book, which is little to get excited about IMHO; Sergio Aragones did this sort of thing much better in Groo the Wanderer.

The movie must have been made in Japan and then dubbed for an American audience as some of the characters and buildings have an Asian look.  In fact, it has a couple of Hayao Miyazaki influences.  The main protangonist is a girl, just like in his films, and it has a quirkiness like the floating islands that you might find in one of his films.  There are also moments of silence and reflection that you don't find in American animated movies very often (except for Pixar).

It becomes four characters on a quest, on a journey with a mission, a frequent theme in animated movies. This is not, however, in the same league with a lot of the computer animated stuff out there because its storyline is too simplistic, not highly original or inspired, and the characters are too one-dimensional. They seem to have no history behind them.Forest Whitaker's voice is that of cloddish Lian-Chu, but his voice is not that distinctive nor quirky enough, not the easily recognizable voice of some other personalities.

Hector is the blue rabbit, but no great thought or creative energy went into the making of these cardboard characters.The movie has some comic elements but not enough.The big hulk central character and his three little friends are often jumping from one clump of floating earth to another, but for little purpose.The big guy, Lian-Chu, knits garments which seems foolish to his buddy, but it turns out that the knitting needles are potent weapons against dragons who seem to be  dull, ineffective, unawe-inspiring monsters.It's probably a good movie for kiddies five and above.",4,Great Graphics - Okay Story,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",2009,1608,"['Dragon', 'Hunters', '2009', 'little', 'Zoe', 'spunky', 'perky', 'aid', 'three', 'weird', 'characters', 'order', 'hunt', 'down', 'dragons', 'Uncle', 'Arnold', 'will', 'pay', 'gold', 'have', 'beasts', 'eliminated.The', 'film', 'great', 'graphics', 'imaginative', 'big', 'hunks', 'firmament', 'floating', 'around', 'space', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'one', 'overall', 'sold', 'piece', 'ground', 'are', 'castles', 'mountains', 'air.Zoe', 'out', 'be', 'heroic', 'little', 'girl', 'four', 'characters', 'quest', 'journey', 'mission', 'frequent', 'theme', 'animated', 'movies', 'not', 'however', 'same', 'league', 'lot', 'computer', 'animated', 'stuff', 'there', 'storyline', 'too', 'simplistic', 'not', 'highly', 'original', 'inspired', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'one-dimensional', 'seem', 'have', 'history', 'them.Forest', 'Whitaker', 'voice', 'cloddish', 'Lian-Chu', 'voice', 'not', 'distinctive', 'quirky', 'enough', 'not', 'easily', 'recognizable', 'voice', 'other', 'personalities', 'Lian-Chu', 'buddy-in-arms', 'Gwizdo', 'operator', 'scam', 'artist', 'Hector', 'blue', 'rabbit', 'great', 'thought', 'creative', 'energy', 'went', 'making', 'cardboard', 'characters.The', 'movie', 'comic', 'elements', 'not', 'enough.The', 'big', 'hulk', 'central', 'character', 'three', 'little', 'friends', 'are', 'often', 'jumping', 'one', 'clump', 'floating', 'earth', 'little', 'purpose.The', 'big', 'guy', 'Lian-Chu', 'garments', 'foolish', 'buddy', 'out', 'knitting', 'needles', 'are', 'potent', 'weapons', 'dragons', 'who', 'seem', 'be', 'dull', 'ineffective', 'unawe-inspiring', 'monsters.It', 'probably', 'good', 'movie', 'kiddies', 'five', 'above']",Dragon Hunters

One is Gwizdo who looks somewhat proportional being a animated character while his companion Lian-Chu looks as if he came from the film Igor with a tiny head, thoothpick legs but arms and upper torso out of Hulk. The two embark on something like a traveling sideshow of glory conquering Dragons wioth Lian doing the work and Gwizdo thinking of riches.their ""talents"" are sought and found by Zoe, a neice to a cold stuborn King whose kingdom is threaten by the King of Dragons; World Globbler. The very same one who destroyed Liams village when he was a child. From there it's a adventure of abck and forth between the three ending with a final battle.

I don't want to sound like a nerd but I cannot believe I have never heard of this animated movie before! I thought I have seen all the good ones (mainly Disney/Pixar, animes, etc) but this one really amazed me.  Even my husband who usually isn't into animated films unless he has to watch one with our 4 yr old was very impressed.  The story is pretty neat and similar to most ""kill the dragon save the world"" stuff.  What sets it apart was that it was truly visually amazing ( comparable to Avatar ) especially in HD and the musical score that accompanies it was quiet perfect.  This movie had some heart, although the side-kick character tended to annoy me some, but Forrest Whitaker was great.  I loved it so much I had to go buy the Blu Ray IMMEDIATELY ( you really can't beat the price of below $10!!!) and I cannot wait to eventually share it with my daughter and the rest of my family.  I really do think it's a must BLU RAY/SURROUND SOUND/minimum 52"" 1080 screen...just for the WOW factor alone! Ok, that's it for my nerd rantings.  Simply a must-seeUPDATE:P.S.

Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.The French were never very good at Sci-fi or fantasy films, but this rule mostly doesn't apply to child oriented cartoons. ""The mysterious cities of gold"", ""Ulysses 31"", ""Spartakus and the sun beneath the sea"" and the most recent of them ""Dragon Hunters"" are all excellent, original and very well made things.""Dragon hunters"" the movie is based on highly succesful French-made TV series, but it can be watched and fully understood separately. It tells the story of three ""dragon hunters"" who are hired by a rich young girl, Zoe, to destroy the most ferocious of all dragons - the abominable World Gobbler, who resides at the end of the world, but raides, burns, kills and devours everywhere where it fancies to go. Of all the three ""dragon hunters"" only one, a huge man named Lian-Chu, does the actual dragon killing. Gwizdo, a fast talking street wise short guy, is mostly Lian-Chu's ""agent"" - and also his best friend. The third member of the team is their pet dog-sized dragon named Hector.The great quality of this film resides first in the visual aspect. The world of ""Dragon Hunters"" doesn't look like ours - it is made of floating islands, some huge, some tiny, connected by all kinds of bridges. Occasionally also some buildings or other features of this world degrade, fall in pieces and are carried away by the winds...Lian-Chu, who is described as a typical ""gentle giant"", is another treasure of this film. He is now a grown up man, but in his childhood he was once grievously wronged and his heart never healed. This melancholy makes him in a character quite different from those pictured by Pixar or Dreamworks.The World Gobbler is the third reason to see this film. It is a particularly ferocious creature, inspired I believe at least partly by the dracolich, a monster from Dungeons and Dragons games - albeit this particular specimen is of GARGANTUAN size! WARNING here - because of the appearance of World Gobbler, this film is probably not recommended for children who are not yet seven years old. Believe me - the World Gobbler is such particularly nasty, evil, gigantic, fast, murderous, ugly and deadly customer that it could probably pick up Smaug the Magnificent with one paw and blow his nose into him!I liked this film a LOT and my then 8-years old daughter liked it too.

A very beautiful film at least in the extent of the landscapes and backgrounds. Everything is floating in a low gravity world; seemingly a world in ruins and decay, fragments of buildings, floating in the air. Quite wonderful.However, the human characters are odd, awkwardly rendered -- and not very successfully. So it is a four star, not a five star rating.The story is rather thin and not too clear. How the Silly Dragon was defeated is not made clear. The World Gobbler was destroyed by Lian Chu throwing knitting needles into the World Gobbler's eyes, but what of the Dragon? It seems electricity and conductivity is the key here, as another dragon, the Jimbob Dragon, was defeated by shorting it out -- it was an electric dragon.Highly original ideas. Very strange. The French tend to make very odd animated features (Fantastic Planet, Light Years, Azur & Ashnar's Prince's Quest, Persepolis -- all weird films). Visually beautiful; but the story was not successful. Both cliched and with holes in the plot. Lian Chu is the hero who hardly says anything, while his partner Quixbo is essentially a con artist and a coward. They are pushed by Princess Zoe, who has read too many fairy tales and fantasies. She wants a knight to come and slay the World Gobbler and save the world. Quixto is only interested in money; but Lian turns out to be the laconic true warrior type and defeats several dragons. Defeating World Gobbler transforms the landscape from a floating belt of ruined buildings to floating balls of bright green grass. A very odd world, but I suspect there is a science fiction novel somewhere where such a world is described.I liked it for the rendering of the landscape not the characters. The characters are ripped from the Fahrd and Gray Mouser characters invented by Fritz Leiber. The story reminds me of any number of Piers Anthony's parodies of fantasy worlds.I understand the film was barely released in the USA and chiefly at film festivals. Though made in France it first opened in Russia.

1238264,AHF97M45JFCB,B001U3D88M,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","Even if you pride yourself on possessing intimate knowledge of the happenings within the computer generated animated feature film industry, there's a pretty good chance 2008's Dragon Hunters flew well below your proverbial radar.  However, unlike most internationally collaborated films of the genre, this isn't necessarily due to lack of quality.The feature film being reviewed here is actually the end result of a (52-episode) French cartoon series of the same name that ran from 2006-2007.Coming in at a runtime of 80-minutes and wearing an appropriate PG rating (for fantasy action, some scary imagery and language), the Dragon Hunters domestic release contains a handful of features including an interview with Forest Whitaker, character biographies, a gallery of the various dragons featured in the film, a look at the Dragon Hunters Universe and an original trailer for the film.Visually the film manages to outdo its budget in nearly every conceivable category from textures to lighting, from character models to color pallet itself (especially in high definition).  Additionally, and adding to the home theatrical experience, scoring and dialog presented in Dolby 5.1 digital surround is mixed flawlessly.The story, which is actually far closer to high fantasy than it is a simplistic fairy tale, centers on a young girl named Zoe, who lives under the tyrannical rule of her uncle in a sprawling castle under the constant threat of being shipped off to the convent.  In the meantime her Uncle, Lord Arnold, can only sit back and await the return of the liege of knights he sent out to destroy a dragon so nasty, that it's mere existence prevents the world from coming into bloom.  Sadly each of his returning knights arrive in various states of failure from having been burned to ash to succumbing to madness.Perhaps the film's greatest strength is in its casting as the slow, monotonous droning of Forest Whitaker (Lian-Chu) is offset brilliantly by the constant fluctuation of Rob Paulsen's animation-staple vocals (Gwizdo).  Add to this mix a small talking dog-like critter (Hector) that could have been lifted directly from Hanna-Barbara and an enthusiastic young girl high on fairy tales and the ensemble plays quite well off one another.Additionally noteworthy is the English mouth flaps- as in they are spot-on enough to convince the viewer that the dialog was originally recorded in English (it's in fact French in its original form).The story takes places in a world that exists in the sky, where massive forms of earth and stone float freely and occasionally collide.  It's a technique that's been accomplished frequently in computer animation (Aero Troopers, Kaena the Prophecy) but perhaps never as convincingly and as visually intriguing as it is here.Where the film falters a bit is in its pacing; which isn't to say that it commits any crimes that would be noticeable by a motion-picture-going audience so much as it possesses none of the snappy polished flow of your average Pixar/ DreamWorks piece.  In fact, this trend could arguably make Dragon Hunters a more appealing piece to a slightly older demographic than that of the projects coming out of the studios mentioned above.  Additionally, while its attempts at humor never actually fail, they are much more subtle and integrated than one typically expects in an animated feature.All of these elements could be viewed as pros or cons depending on your expectations going into the film.  For me personally, the plot seemed to drag on a bit at about the  mark, due in part perhaps to the fact that the presentation values are so high in the production that the Pixar always-perfect pacing began to feel like a given.  Unfortunately, it never manifests.  The dialog too seems a bit more subdue and snide than is often expected in an animated feature.  Again, perhaps not a bad thing in and of itself but certainly something to be aware of going in.All in all, it's tough to come away from this film without a deeper appreciation for what goes into creating a computer generated feature from the ground up.  The sheer volume of companies vested in bringing this film to life is staggering.  The end result is quite solid; certainly more enjoyable if viewed from the perspective of an animated fantasy piece not unlike Labyrinth or The Dark Crystal than say, a less-popular alternative to How to Train Your Dragon.  Younger audiences may find the movie-like pacing and lack of cartoony dialog a bit of a trudge to get through but older viewers, especially those with a soft spot for fantasy, will definitely find much to enjoy here.",4,High Quality Fantasy CG Work,1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,4607,"['Even', 'pride', 'possessing', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'happenings', 'computer', 'generated', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'industry', 'pretty', 'good', 'chance', '2008', 'Dragon', 'Hunters', 'flew', 'well', 'proverbial', 'radar', 'However', 'most', 'internationally', 'collaborated', 'films', 'genre', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'due', 'lack', 'quality.The', 'feature', 'film', 'being', 'reviewed', 'here', 'actually', 'end', 'result', '52-episode', 'French', 'cartoon', 'series', 'same', 'name', 'ran', '2006-2007.Coming', 'runtime', '80-minutes', 'wearing', 'appropriate', 'PG', 'rating', 'fantasy', 'action', 'scary', 'imagery', 'language', 'Dragon', 'Hunters', 'domestic', 'release', 'handful', 'features', 'including', 'interview', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'character', 'biographies', 'gallery', 'various', 'dragons', 'featured', 'film', 'look', 'Dragon', 'Hunters', 'Universe', 'original', 'trailer', 'film.Visually', 'film', 'outdo', 'budget', 'nearly', 'conceivable', 'category', 'textures', 'lighting', 'character', 'models', 'color', 'pallet', 'especially', 'high', 'definition', 'Additionally', 'adding', 'home', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'scoring', 'dialog', 'presented', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'digital', 'surround', 'mixed', 'flawlessly.The', 'story', 'actually', 'far', 'closer', 'high', 'fantasy', 'simplistic', 'fairy', 'tale', 'centers', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Zoe', 'who', 'tyrannical', 'rule', 'uncle', 'sprawling', 'castle', 'constant', 'threat', 'being', 'shipped', 'convent', 'meantime', 'Uncle', 'Lord', 'Arnold', 'can', 'only', 'sit', 'back', 'await', 'return', 'liege', 'knights', 'sent', 'out', 'destroy', 'dragon', 'so', 'nasty', 'mere', 'existence', 'world', 'coming', 'bloom', 'Sadly', 'returning', 'knights', 'arrive', 'various', 'states', 'failure', 'having', 'been', 'burned', 'ash', 'succumbing', 'madness.Perhaps', 'film', 'greatest', 'strength', 'casting', 'slow', 'monotonous', 'droning', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Lian-Chu', 'offset', 'brilliantly', 'constant', 'fluctuation', 'Rob', 'Paulsen', 'animation-staple', 'vocals', 'Gwizdo', 'Add', 'mix', 'small', 'talking', 'dog-like', 'critter', 'Hector', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lifted', 'directly', 'Hanna-Barbara', 'enthusiastic', 'young', 'girl', 'high', 'fairy', 'tales', 'ensemble', 'plays', 'quite', 'well', 'one', 'another.Additionally', 'noteworthy', 'English', 'mouth', 'flaps-', 'are', 'spot-on', 'enough', 'convince', 'viewer', 'dialog', 'was', 'originally', 'recorded', 'English', 'fact', 'French', 'original', 'form', 'story', 'places', 'world', 'sky', 'where', 'massive', 'forms', 'earth', 'stone', 'float', 'freely', 'occasionally', 'collide', 'technique', 'been', 'accomplished', 'frequently', 'computer', 'animation', 'Aero', 'Troopers', 'Kaena', 'Prophecy', 'perhaps', 'never', 'convincingly', 'visually', 'intriguing', 'here.Where', 'film', 'bit', 'pacing', ""n't"", 'say', 'crimes', 'would', 'be', 'noticeable', 'motion-picture-going', 'audience', 'so', 'much', 'none', 'snappy', 'polished', 'flow', 'average', 'Pixar/', 'DreamWorks', 'piece', 'fact', 'trend', 'could', 'arguably', 'make', 'Dragon', 'Hunters', 'more', 'appealing', 'piece', 'slightly', 'older', 'demographic', 'projects', 'coming', 'studios', 'mentioned', 'Additionally', 'attempts', 'humor', 'never', 'actually', 'fail', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'subtle', 'integrated', 'one', 'typically', 'animated', 'feature.All', 'elements', 'could', 'be', 'viewed', 'pros', 'cons', 'depending', 'expectations', 'going', 'film', 'personally', 'plot', 'seemed', 'drag', 'bit', 'mark', 'due', 'part', 'perhaps', 'fact', 'presentation', 'values', 'are', 'so', 'high', 'production', 'Pixar', 'always-perfect', 'pacing', 'began', 'feel', 'given', 'Unfortunately', 'never', 'dialog', 'too', 'bit', 'more', 'subdue', 'snide', 'often', 'expected', 'animated', 'feature', 'Again', 'perhaps', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'certainly', 'something', 'be', 'aware', 'going', 'in.All', 'tough', 'come', 'away', 'film', 'deeper', 'appreciation', 'what', 'creating', 'computer', 'generated', 'feature', 'ground', 'up', 'sheer', 'volume', 'companies', 'vested', 'bringing', 'film', 'life', 'staggering', 'end', 'result', 'quite', 'solid', 'certainly', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'viewed', 'perspective', 'animated', 'fantasy', 'piece', 'not', 'Labyrinth', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'say', 'less-popular', 'alternative', 'How', 'Train', 'Dragon', 'Younger', 'audiences', 'may', 'find', 'movie-like', 'pacing', 'lack', 'cartoony', 'dialog', 'bit', 'trudge', 'get', 'older', 'viewers', 'especially', 'soft', 'spot', 'fantasy', 'will', 'definitely', 'find', 'much', 'enjoy', 'here']",Dragon Hunters

1238268,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B001U3D88M,Ranny Levy,"[0, 0]","This animated film is about a vastly changed world made up of many floating islands, where the two main rules are: eat and don't get eaten. These islands are infested with mutant dragons, which is where the two main characters come in: Gwizdo (Rob Pausen) and Lian-Chu (Forest Whitaker), who are dragon hunters. When these two meet a little girl named Zoe (Mary Matilyn Mouser), she takes them to her rich uncle, Lord Arnold, who sends them on a mission to kill the World Eater, a horrifying dragon that returns every 30 years and wreaks terror and destruction. This dragon hunt sends Zoe, Gwizdo and Lian-Chu and a great adventure. Will they be able to kill the mighty dragon once and for all before it's too late? You will just have to watch and find out.My favorite character is Hector, the small blue dog-like pet of Gwizdo and Lian-Chu. I like Hector because he is an adorable little creature and he was so unbelievably hilarious. My favorite scene is the scene when Gwizdo starts going insane. I like this scene because it is so funny and hilarious how he freaks Hector and Zoe out. The animation in this film is very well done. For example, the various dragons are very cool and realistic, as are the different characters in this film. The action sequences are thrilling, thanks to the excellent CGI effects. The voice over work is excellent and the different personalities, really come through from the different voices.This animated film has an excellent story line, is well written and I know everyone will enjoy this entertaining film as much as I. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars because it is very enjoyable, fantastic, and entertaining. I think this film is for ages 6 and up because I know that the younger children might become very afraid in some of the action sequences, but other kids will enjoy the story and the action packed adventure that the three main characters go on.

In brief summary, it turned out great.We have a story of fantasy, peril, comic relief, bravery and action all set against a beautiful world where gravity has a much different outcome. The picture clarity looked amazing. There are brief blips in the motion here and there, but overall the quality turned out vivid, crisp and articulate. Reference the wide pan shots where the characters are extremely small; on the DVD they were little blips, on the Blu they were distinguishable with arms and legs.The sound was outstanding. All five channels are used extensively, and it appears no imagination was spared on how to make these floating villages and action sequences surround you.The special features are catered to the kids who follow stories like this with trading cards and such. The Universe of DH, Character Biography and Dragon Gallery options can be surfed through like reading a book on all the creatures and locations we just watched. The Interview With Forest Whitaker lasts less than five minutes and shows the production process of recording in studio.I have not watched the original series, but I hope they continue with more films of this quality and story.

Nothing has to make sense in this visually dazzling (so much so that it overloads the mind--there's not enough bland breaks to give your mind a rest--and the constantly changing/ rotating/ crumbling/ spinning world is enough to give even the most ADHD addled kid a headache) CGI fairy tale and not much does, including the relationships.  How the good-natured and big-hearted Lian-Chu sticks with the corrupting Gwizdo is not answered and is counter-intuitive.  Speaking of intuitive, I believe that this film is a French production.  Perhaps some of the sensibilities don't translate to an American audience?  I don't know but fear not for though a French production everyone speaks English.  There aren't that many dragons (this film pales in comparison to the slightly similar ""How To Train Your Dragon"") and the pacing of the action is so dog gone quick it is hard to enjoy at times.  Will kids like it?  Some, but many will get lost and lose interest.  What will keep them most interested is the piggish dog thing that is the travelling companion of our two heroes.

I went in with no expectations or maybe a bit of a negative impression as this is from an unknown publisher and I  wasn't sure if the animation or storuy was going to be good or not (being used to dreamworks and pixar films) Well all I can say was that I was Pleasantly Surprised at how good this movie truly was.  The animation was on par with that of most others I have seen from the above mentioned companies and the story was also.  I kept waiting for the story to turn boring or lame and it did not. It kept me interested from beginning to end and I would say that this movie was at least as good as that of a major company. It had some humor, some cuteness, some sadness and some happiness overall if I could give this movie 6 STARS I would. Just for the fact that it was not made by a major studio, but yet was on par with same. VERY NICE and I look forward to many more good movies from this same studio.
