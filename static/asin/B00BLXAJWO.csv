1635568,A1BVKUA32LKR2W,B00BLXAJWO,Phantom Bookworm,"[1, 1]","I just finished watching this movie on Netflix. My mom recommended that I watch it. Dorfman in Love is about a woman named Debra who is madly in love with her older brother's best friend (who only really pays attention to her when he needs her to do something for him, and she is so blindly infatuated that will bend over backwards to make him happy), she is an accountant for her bonehead brother, and she takes care of her mourning widower father who refuses to eat, constantly wears black, and watches infomercials all day. Debra juggles all of this without complaint, even though it is clear to the audience that she is unsatisfied, overlooked, feeling lost, and missing her deceased mother.When Jay, the man she is in love with, leaves town for work, she travels from her quiet life in the Valley to bustling Los Angeles, where she babysits Jay's cat and is forced to unpack his belongings and decorate his new loft. She is determined to accomplish all of this by the time Jay returns home because she thinks he will return her feelings if she manages to impress him enough. Over the course of a week, she befriends an artist named Cookie and begins to explore everything that Los Angeles has to offer. Over the course of a week, Debra begins to figure out who she is, what she wants from life, and is able to tap into her inner spunk to prove to her family and friends that she is a force to be reckoned with. A lot happens in this movie, but I'm not going to rehash it here.What I thought of Dorfman in Love: This was a really, really pleasant surprise! In fact, I think the cover of the DVD is a little misleading. This isn't a corny chick flick; it's a very well-made movie that is relentlessly funny, hilarious, touching, inspirational, empowering, and relatable. Debra Dorfman starts out as this cute, though rather plain and frumpy, girl who listens to romance novels on audio on her way to work, snorts when she laughs, and is totally socially awkward. She is adorable and endearing, and the actress who brings this character to life did such an amazing job. Even prior to Debra's transformation, when she is a kind of a doormat, the audience can recognize her sass, charm, and vivacity. These qualities just become more apparent as she leans to quit apologizing for things that aren't her fault, to stand up for herself, and to assert herself as a human being with wants and needs of her own.Also, the supporting cast was fantastic. Everyone played their role so well. Other characters in the story, such as the father, grow and change as well -- not just Debra. I got a real kick out of the dad. Another thing I really appreciated about this movie: there was a lot of diversity, in terms of people, which I feel more accurately represents life. Most of the time, I watch movies where everyone is White, except for one random ethnic minority, or vice versa. There never seems to be a real in-between of this in movies, and I understand that filmmakers do this because they are trying to make their movie marketable for who they think will most likely watch the movie. Maybe it's just me, but that has always been a real pet peeve of mine. In this movie, however, there is a whole melting pot of people coexisting and intermingling with each other, which I think is more realistic and simply fills me with joy to see.I definitely recommend this movie; it's simply awesome -- and not just for women! :)",5,Hilarious!

1635569,A3IFZKHNBJZXK8,B00BLXAJWO,RMS,"[0, 0]","Most romantic films I find to be stupid and the women in them pathetic because they are so desperate for a man. In ""Dorfman in Love"", Deb Dorfman pines after Jay Cleary but not in a pathetic desperate way. So many women in romantic movies seem to feel they must have a man to feel happy in life and to have self-worth, as if not having a man makes them nothing. But in the case of Deb Dorfman, she goes about her life without feeling she has to have a man. Yes, she says she wants love, but who doesn't? Deb's lack of confidence isn't because she doesn't have Jay as her boyfriend, but because she sees herself not as someone who is fun, sweet, intelligent and beautiful. In this movie Deb eventually learns to live her own life instead of living it for others. She also learns to see herself as someone who is fun, sweet, intelligent and beautiful and although she didn't need a man to show her this about herself, it was a man who did. It wasn't because he's a man, but because he's the type of person who sees beauty and is able to turn it around for others to see. Haaz Sleiman as Cookie I think really stole the film; he truly shines in this movie. Sara Rue is adorable as Deb as well. The film is well acted and not too cheesy or too slapstick like so many romantic films are. I enjoyed seeing Los Angeles as I was born and raised in Southern California and I am homesick and miss my old stomping grounds. The only down side to this film are two things: 1. Having Haaz Sleiman's character, Cookie, go from saying he's gay to falling in love with a woman. In real life, this typically doesn't happen. I have had several gay friends and they don't suddenly just switch sexual orientation; and 2. The makeover of Deb. Before the makeover she looked like an average person. Then she was transformed into this model looking creature that barely resembled the first Deb. That's all well and good, but doing the makeover shtick is not only a tired romantic clich&eacute; (remember Toula Portokalos's makeover in, ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding""?), but it implies that an average looking woman can't find love unless she's turned into someone who's pictures belong in Vogue magazine. But for what it's worth, this is a pretty decent movie. I really liked it.

Deb busies herself giving the loft a makeover while Jay is away and, with the urging of Jay's neighbors, gives herself one, too.Ms. Rue does a commendable job with a role that locks her into stereotypical behavior and predictable outcomes.  She's has a pleasant personality, and that makes this otherwise bland film watchable.
