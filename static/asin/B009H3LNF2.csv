1596597,A28SBPF6KFZ7VL,B009H3LNF2,Eric K.,"[11, 13]","The Snorks came about because of the popularity of the Smurfs.  To differentiate them, the Snorks were small underwater creatures instead of forest-dwelling ones.  Their stories were equally cute and harmless, though; perfect for kids.  Their cartoons didn't have fighting, violence, etc.  They offered stories with lessons presented in a fun way.  I still have a special place in my heart for the Snorks.  They were a great addition to my Saturday morning cartoon ritual which also included the Smurfs.",5,Underwater Smurfs,1351728000,"11 1, 2012",2012,503,"['Snorks', 'came', 'about', 'popularity', 'Smurfs', 'differentiate', 'Snorks', 'were', 'small', 'underwater', 'creatures', 'instead', 'forest-dwelling', 'ones', 'stories', 'were', 'equally', 'cute', 'harmless', 'though', 'perfect', 'kids', 'cartoons', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'fighting', 'violence', 'etc', 'offered', 'stories', 'lessons', 'presented', 'fun', 'way', 'still', 'have', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'Snorks', 'were', 'great', 'addition', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'ritual', 'also', 'included', 'Smurfs']",Snorks: Complete Season 1

The theme song is more hotter then Spongebob Squarepants' song because it's more rock in' and fun. This series is fun like the Smurfs and Spongebob Squrepants.

1596604,A1ZAN7KBME97B3,B009H3LNF2,Tiger100M,"[2, 2]","I love this cartoon! It's one of my favorites! When I discovered this show on Boomerang in the summer of 2008, I've been waiting for this show to start coming out on DVD. I guess I was going to get it after all, I just had to wait 4 years later. I got this DVD for Christmas, and I loved it. I'm not sure why they  didn't include bonus features, but I don't care because one, I haven't been all into bonus features, and two, the focus is kept where it should be-watching the episodes themselves. What's great about this cartoon? The underwater theme is great, and more importantly, the characters! They're just so likeable, except Junior Wetworth. He's a ""Gaston"" sort of bully, but the comedy is him getting punished in the end, mainly by Occy. Speaking of which, I also love Occy because he's an octopus version of a dog. I like Daffney for being a fashion lover and icky stuff hater, Dimmy for TRYING to act tough but not succeeding, Tooter for honking but not speaking, and most importantly Allstar and Casey. Allstar is great for being brave, heroic, and knowing what's right and wrong. I LOVE Casey Kelp too because she's beautiful on the outside AND on the inside. She always puts helping others before herself, she's strong, proud, and kind, like a good heroine should be. She's my favorite animated heroine of all time.
