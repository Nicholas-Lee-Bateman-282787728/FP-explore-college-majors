I am finally glad to see this series get some recognition. This has to be, by far, the funniest thing on television. And this, the 3rd season, is my very favorite, with several of my favorite episodes from the entire series, particulary ""Chet's Shirt"", ""The Corpse-Sniffing Dog"", ""Crazy-Eyez Killah"", and ""The Grand Opening"".For the first time, a central theme is loosely followed from the beginning of the season to the end, where Larry along with several celebrity (and non-celebrity) business partners decide to invest in a restaurant. The season finale ends with the grand opening of the restuarant, and it is the most hilarious season finale a comedy show has ever had, in my opinion.Very Highly Recommended!",5,"""The absolute best season yet""",1107388800,"02 3, 2005",2005,807,"['HBO', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'really', 'off', 'overdrive', '3rd', 'season', 'series', 'am', 'finally', 'glad', 'see', 'series', 'get', 'recognition', 'be', 'far', 'funniest', 'thing', 'television', '3rd', 'season', 'very', 'favorite', 'several', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'particulary', 'Chet', 'Shirt', 'Corpse-Sniffing', 'Dog', 'Crazy-Eyez', 'Killah', 'Grand', 'Opening', '.For', 'first', 'time', 'central', 'theme', 'loosely', 'followed', 'beginning', 'season', 'end', 'where', 'Larry', 'several', 'celebrity', 'non-celebrity', 'business', 'partners', 'decide', 'invest', 'restaurant', 'season', 'finale', 'grand', 'opening', 'restuarant', 'most', 'hilarious', 'season', 'finale', 'comedy', 'show', 'ever', 'had', 'opinion.Very', 'Highly', 'Recommended']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 3

I don't know how one goes up from 5 stars, but somehow they managed to do it.  The main characters are the same as from the first two seasons, with Larry David playing himself, Jeff Garlin as Jeff Greene (Larry's agent), and Cheryl Hines as Cheryl David (Larry's wife). Also, as with the first two seasons the dialogue is improvised, and the shows focus on a single character (Larry) as opposed to an ensemble as was the case with ""Seinfeld"".As with the first two seasons, there are ten episodes in the season of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"".  This season, the season long plot is Larry investing in a restaurant along with several other people (e.g. Ted Danson, Michael York) and the problems they have along he way (e.g. finding and losing chefs, uniforms for the wait staff, a restaurant critic, etc.).  Each episode also has its own plot, which cover a wide variety of subjects such as religion (Christian Science, nativity scenes), Terrorist attacks, mourning, pets, and much more.  All the episodes are very funny, but ""Krazee-Eyez Killa"", ""The Terrorist Attack"", and ""The Grand Opening"" are not to be missed.This DVD box set includes 2 DVDs, which have all 10 episodes, as well as a couple of excerpts from the ""U.S. Comedy Arts Festival"" in which members of the cast and directors discuss the show and their favorite scenes.",5,The Best Yet,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,1387,"['third', 'season', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'best', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'one', '5', 'stars', 'somehow', 'managed', 'do', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'same', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Larry', 'David', 'playing', 'Jeff', 'Garlin', 'Jeff', 'Greene', 'Larry', 'agent', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'Cheryl', 'David', 'Larry', 'wife', 'Also', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'dialogue', 'improvised', 'shows', 'focus', 'single', 'character', 'Larry', 'opposed', 'ensemble', 'was', 'case', 'Seinfeld', '.As', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'ten', 'episodes', 'season', 'Curb', 'Your', 'Enthusiasm', 'season', 'season', 'long', 'plot', 'Larry', 'investing', 'restaurant', 'several', 'other', 'people', 'e.g', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'Michael', 'York', 'problems', 'have', 'along', 'way', 'e.g', 'finding', 'losing', 'chefs', 'uniforms', 'wait', 'staff', 'restaurant', 'critic', 'etc.', 'episode', 'also', 'own', 'plot', 'cover', 'wide', 'variety', 'subjects', 'such', 'religion', 'Christian', 'Science', 'nativity', 'scenes', 'Terrorist', 'attacks', 'mourning', 'pets', 'much', 'more', 'episodes', 'are', 'very', 'funny', 'Krazee-Eyez', 'Killa', 'Terrorist', 'Attack', 'Grand', 'Opening', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'missed.This', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', '2', 'DVDs', 'have', '10', 'episodes', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'excerpts', 'U.S', 'Comedy', 'Arts', 'Festival', 'members', 'cast', 'directors', 'discuss', 'show', 'favorite', 'scenes']",Curb Your Enthusiasm: Season 3

(That this terrific show has come about largely in the Bush years is either by some magical design or merely a lucky break for guys like me.)  Each episode is like a well-oiled machine and with a structure that is worthy of study in any film class.  All the touches are there:  terrific performers who nail their characters; recurring musical themes that subtly underscore the action; plot lines that bring together seemingly loose threads which, by the end, render a perfect piece of cloth; crisp editing to capture the very best of the largely-improvised moments. Season Three is as fresh and enjoyable as the first two seasons, and includes several classic moments:  Larry inadvertently eating the nativity cookies his wife and inlaws bake in celebration of Christmas, and, classically, his failed attempt to redeem himself by hiring live performers to recreate the nativity scene on his front lawn; Larry's interaction with a rapper named Krazee-Eyez Killa, in which two very different worlds collide; the Looney Tunes nanny who ends up giving a purpose to sponge cake; and on and on.

862596,A2Q9KSU3SEYVMT,B00067BCB8,"Fluffy Sausage ""Homer Simpson""","[6, 6]","CYE has matured to move away from the single, self-enclosed episode format to offer an overarching storyline. The first episode kicks off the main theme of Larry investing in a restaurant with celebrities Ted Danson and Michael York. The restaurant story wonderfully ties together the 10 miniplots, each dealing with several different themes. Season 3 covers the threat of a terrorist attack, pi&ntilde;atas, tipping, a corpse-sniffing dog, affinity between bald men, house tours, pubic hairs, pet allergies, accusations of stalking, marital jealousy, gossip, Bartlett pears and more. Is it okay to ask a mourning widow where her late husband bought the shirt he's wearing in a photo? Can you throw trash in someone else's trash can? Can you turn down a house tour? Is it okay to congratulate someone on his kid's big penis? Nothing is holy, nothing off limits, especially not religion. David tackles Christian Science's aversion to medicine, Jews with tattoos, and spreads his own brand of Christmas cheer when he ruins a manger scene by eating Baby Jesus.Of all three seasons so far, Season 3 is not only the most quotable, it's also the most uplifting. Larry still gets into heaps of trouble and you'll be cringing at the masterful derailments and degeneration into total chaos, but in the end, Larry actually emerges with his head held high. You'll start to understand the man. You'll know that he doesn't hate people.

Since I don't get HBO, I proceeded to rent the first two seasons on DVD a couple of months ago. Let's just say I had Season 3 pre ordered ASAP. This truly is deserving of the many claims it has received as one of the funniest shows on television. It certainly is the funniest thing I have seen in recent memory.CYE Season 3 keeps up the hilarity of the previous seasons, and makes the series seem a bit more seamless, although each episode can still be plenty enjoyed as a stand alone. By now, if you are considering purchasing this set, you must have already seen the first two seasons (and if not, what are you waiting for? Go!), and this season is in the same vein as the prior two.However, this show is not for everyone and the faint of heart. Yes there are awkward situations and sexual references, yes there is vulgarity, and if that is all you can see (or if you can't handle it), then this show is certainly not for you. If you are a person who is easily offended by some dirty humor, you'll want to stay far, far away from Curb. But there is genuine comic genius in just about every episode of this show, and if you can deal with the wanton attitude and coarse nature of the show, then you're in for a real treat. Once again, if you've already seen the first two seasons already, you'll know what you're in for.If Seinfeld was a show about nothing, CYE is a show about nothing that quickly turns into something. In case you haven't already seen the show, seemingly trivial and minor incidents that occur to Larry David early on always become magnified and return to play a role of huge consequence later in the episode. If you think you're having a bad day, just wait until you see some of the exploits of Larry David. The man must have the worst luck around! If you appreciate the style of humor the show has, you will surely burst out laughing at least once every episode. Larry David may come off as a direspectful, ignorant, snob to some, but I'm sure most people can relate to him at least in some small degree.

862601,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B00067BCB8,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[9, 15]","I got CYE based on seeing it in the DVD store, never having seen HBO.  I know Larry David is the co creator and writer on Seinfeld, yet as comedian actor he is totally new to me.It is fascinating and a little disturbing to see the similarities between Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld.  The gestures, intonation, delivery, humor and even similar facial expressions are a little eerie at times.  Who influenced who?This third season is brilliant with obvious parallels with both Seinfeld and Fawlty Towers starring John Cleese. Minor situations become major drama, with the main character creating situations which become farcical and then get resolved.  The ruthless self absorption of the LD character, is quite compelling to watch, as he fearlessly goes where other people just wouldn't, and is often oblivious or indifferent to the destruction he causes.  You just got to admire someone who relentlessly does not care what other people think.I was particularly appalled by the firing of the chef, after hiring him for being bald, and then firing him for wearing a toupee.Refusing to thank a friend's wife for buying dinner, because her husband put down the card, and he was the bread winner, as it was his money not their money that was paying for the meal.Shamelessly using the death of his mother to get sympathy sex from Cheryl.Having Cheryl bake cookies filled with Benadryl so that Richard Lewis' new Christian girlfriend who refused to take medication would eat them and recover quickly from her peanut allergy reaction which LD triggered.  The beauty of it would be she would think her recovery was due to prayer.Asking a waiter for the tip back because he thought he had tipped him twice.Giving his friend a yoga mantra, Ja Ya then asking him to stop using it.  Friend discovers yoga mantra means f--- me!The episode where he hires the chef with Tourette's syndrome, is classic in the way of Seinfeld.I think my favorite episode if I had to choose is the Corpse Sniffing Dog.Cheryl the wife is priceless as a study in patience 'Loving you is my job Larry.'I could go on.  LD is truly appalling, yet I love the show, and have also ordered season 2.  The series does contain some strong language, compared to network offerings.  Update: Having now seen season 2 as well, I consider season 3 is consistently better, although I have to say season 2 has a couple of really outstanding episodes.

The season's main theme is about a new restaurant in which Larry and Jeff become investors.  Finding a chef for the new place means Larry goes through a laundry list of reason to reject and accept new people.  From a chef wearing toupees to a Chef with  Tourettes Syndrome Larry and company cannot catch a break.The story and acting are all top form.  The Nanny, The Benadryl Brownie, and Crazy Eyez Killah are the highlights of season three.  There are some great cameos from Martin Scorsese, Martin Short, and Alanis Morissette.  Overall season three is an excellent edition to the Curb Your Enthusiasm collection.  Laugh as Larry gets a kid drunk, digs up his dead mother, and spikes some brownies.  There is no other show on TV like it and hopefully Larry David's brand of humor continues to find an outlet.

He's oblivious of the feelings of others (see the 1st episode, ""Chet's Shirt"", in which he is incapable of expressing any sympathy towards a recent widow) and he's whinier and more self-centered than ever.  Many of his troubles now stem from his endless quest to either ""get his way"" or ""not be bothered.""

The wife of Larry's agent is back on the scene, and she's always a riot...the one person who really takes no guff from Larry.  The situations are richer and more convoluted than ever, and virtually no plot points are left dangling after any given episode...they all tend to tie up neatly in the last five seconds of the episode.  (A throwaway bit early on shows Larry strolling down his neighborhood and tossing an apple core into the garbage can of a neighbor...said neighbor is upset and words ensue.  The bit is dropped until the last, hilarious scene, when we've completely forgotten it.)  I think the writing is tauter and has a nastier edge than ever...which is what I like.

Although Seinfeld gets my good rating, Curb Your Enthusiasm gets my great rating. To me, the Seinfeld show didn't really get worth not missing, till probably halfway through the series. However, Curb Your Enthusiasm has already reached this point of interest in my mind.For Seinfeld fans who always wondered what the show would be like a little more uncensored, Curb Your Enthusiasm is definitely worth checking out. For fans of comedy blended brilliantly with irony, buy this series. I have to admit that the third season is really when the show begins to keep you on watch detail. Though the seasons always seem to be taking place around the same time. This season is when it really becomes more satisfying to see each episode back to back.To fans of both shows, I can't recommend this purchase more. Also, to fans of obviously, long-thought out comedy writing and very clever and sometimes precise comedic timing, this show is worth investing attention. For me, buying this series on dvd was a worthwhile investment. I personally can watch any episode of any season and be more entertained than channel surfing.Finally, I must admit, that I hope this show goes on as long as Seinfeld, if not, longer.
