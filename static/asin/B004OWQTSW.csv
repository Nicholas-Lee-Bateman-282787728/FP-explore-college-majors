1423147,A3MQ672FYFNM7B,B004OWQTSW,JGC,"[2, 4]","One of the reasons why the series is being brought back onto DVD is because of the fans. The fans never forgot it and never will.This is a 3-disc set of the first 13 eps of season 6:Brand New DayCoop visits his former loves gravesite (that old kook, Kimberly) and then vows to avenge her honor. Peter dramatically leaves Taylor at the alter. I love how Taylor falls to the ground in tears as he strands her. Can you say drama-queen!!!Trojan StorkLet the game of cat and mouse begin! Taylor matter-of-factly informs Amanda that Matt Fielding rented her an apartment in her building to her abhorrence. Kyle then hears gossip about Taylor's pregnancy and like a dried up old scab just picks away at it because God forbid he leave well enough alone. Of course Taylor uses the lie to her advantage and stirs up even more trouble between blockhead and ice-princess.No Time for Sperm BanksMegan gets Michael to agree to go to counseling session. Taylor rapes Michael. Although you can't really rape the willing, can you? Amanda begins her big (and overdone) ""take over"" of Sky High Advertising.The Doctor Is In... Deep(If that Dr. is Coop he sure can get in deep.) Peter meets Lex at a doctor's convention that Coop is dodging. Taylor's again back to her old tricks of yanking Mikey's monkey in the hopes of getting pregnant so she can trick blockhead into coming back to her. Marian Shaw makes a rare cameo, dramatically warning Coop about that evil man (Michael, who else?). BTW did you see how Mrs. Shaw was dressed? It was almost like she was calling Coop for phone sex. I suppose stranger things on MP have happened.Desperately Seeking SamanthaStupid, horrid ep about Billy and his throw-away, stupid, girlfriend. Although all isn't lost because we get treated to some drama when Megan walks in on Taylor and Michael getting it on.The Light at the End of the TumbleTaylor falls because Amanda (sorta) pushed her. With the help of Michael she tells blockhead that she ""lost"" the baby. Peter learns (from Lexi) that Coop had an affair with Kimberly. Taylor tries to smooth things over with Megan, claiming that she slipped Michael a drug. Isn't it funny how Megan all-of-a-sudden knows about pharmaceuticals and precedes to give Taylor a lesson in medicine like she's the good doctor (um hello, you're a hooker).Secrets and WivesKyle, Taylor, Amanda drama/nonsense. Mrs. Shaw resurfaces to pay Coop a surprise visit. I love how Coop theatrically yanks her arm as he pulls her away and she says, ""will you please get your hands off me.""Shot in the DarkMrs. Shaw begins stalking Michael. And the idiot thinks that Kimberly has come back from beyond the grave (didn't that happen like 4 seasons ago?). Craig gives Jennifer a new car as a reward for his new start-up business.Attack of the Scalpel WomanThe ghost of Kimberly returns. This time it's in the form of a crazy old lady named Marion Shaw. Once it's revealed that she's Michael's stalker he threatens to have her arrested. But Coop, the sweetheart that he is convinces Michael not to press charges. He has her shipped off to a special hospital. But Mrs. Shaw misses her connecting flight and comes to the hospital; disguised as a doctor, she stabs poor Megan.My Little Coma GirlMore stupidity between Baines/Amanda and Kyle.Everybody Comes to Kyle'sCoop sues Michael for stealing his idea. Lexi (drunk on who knows what) hits something (or someone) with her car.A Bump in the NightPeter finds out that Lexi hit a man with her car. Peter sets up Bob at the hospital.A Tree Talks in MelroseMichael tries to win (ex)-wife #4, aka Megan back from the clutches of Coop. Let's see, an ignorant, miserable old cheat with the morals and the acumen of an alley cat or Coop. I think we all know who she choose. Jennifer blackmails Lexi into getting Coop to drop the charges against her brother.Although there was a 4-month hiatus between the 25th and the 26th eps, season 6 was extra, super, duper long. It's very rare to find a network series that produced in excess of the standard 22-24 eps per season and MP consistently did this for 7 years. (S7 actually started like only a week after S6 ended which is very unusual BTW.) There are a total of 31 eps in the season (including 2 2-parters, NOT part of this set though), let's hope Paramount/CBS Home Video puts out S6/V2 before the end of the year.If you enjoy old school TV, over-the-top catfights and man-hungry barracudas then you need to get this. Because you never know what they're going to do, you just want to be there when they do it.
