1178051,A1MFDFUGEVNIFK,B001CY5N1E,AyJay,"[1, 2]","KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS is something shouldn't like [it's obviously scripted, despite being flogged as a fly-on-the-wall show], but I watch anyway.The Kardashian family are: Mum Kris Jenner, Her husband Bruce [Olympic gold medal winner], Kris' older children; Kourtney, Kimberly, Khloe, Robert [their father is late L.A. power attorney Robert Kardashian] and Kris' and Bruce's daughters Kylie and Kendall.Most of the episodes center around Kim [she's the one with the T&A; and her own best-selling sex tape], although she is actually boring and very me-me-me. She keeping referring to herself as famous, but this is the recording of the first season, she was just known as 'the girl in that sex tape' at this point... Robert is another weak link - he seems nice, but doesn't do anything when he'sonscreen, but luckily he's away in uni most of the time.What keeps me viewing is Khloe's sense of humour. She is hilarious and whenever she pairs up with Kourtney you know there is bound to be something worth watching about to happen. Khloe is the standout on the show and since she and Kourtney are so good together they now have a spin off show [Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami] too, which often outperforms this show for ratings in the US.Bruce is also very funny, but he is often drowned out by the girls, which is a shame. Momager Kris is much more likable then I thought she would be and is feisty. Kylie and Kendall don't really get too much screen time, but as they're in their early teens I think Bruce and Kris are being responsible in limiting their exposure.Episode 1: I'm Watching YouKim prepares her first big TV interview, where she'll have to discuss her sex tape and everyone helps to set up a anniversary party for Bruce and Kris.Episode 2: Managing MomBeing a busy working mum [she owns a store and is manager to Bruce as well as Kim] starts to take it's tole on Kris, so she hires a nanny. Meanwhile Kim debates firing her as her manager.Episode 3: Brody in the HouseAs the girls and Rob all go to Mexico for a saucy shoot, Bruce is told that they're taking a vacation. When he finds out that they're doing a shoot for a swimwear range owned by the creator of 'Girls Gone Wild' he goes after them and asks his son Brody Jenner to stay at the family home to look after Kylie and Kendall.Episode 4: Birthday SuitPlayboy ask Kim to pose for them, much to Bruce's dismay, but as he says ""Why ask for my opinion? You're going to do what you want anyway"". Kim decides to only do it if she doesn't have to take her clothes off, but this is Playboy - do you think they'll be happy with that?Episode 5: Remembering DadAs the anniversary of her father's death approaches, a emotionally fragile Khloe is arrested for a DUI. Luckily the camera crew are on hand to recreate the drama. Literally. There's even a disclaimer at the start of the episode disclosing that ""this episode features recreations of actual events"". See? Not scripted at all - pure reality!Episode 6: You Are So Pregnant, Dude!Kourtney takes a pregnancy test and there is a wild weekend for the girls [and Rob] in Vegas - will a classy Vegas wedding be involved for one of them? Meanwhile Kris buys Kendall a puppy and instructs her to keep it hidden from poor Bruce, who said no...Episode 7: Helping HandKhloe asks Kris what she should do about the homeless man outside the girls store and is told to show some compassion. So she and Kourtney take him to the family home to clean him up.Episode 8: The Price of FameKim is devastated when she learns that some old photos she stole and later misplaced of Kourtney as a teenager wind up in the wrong hands. Is Kourtney about to be the next Kardashian 'Superstar'? Kris wastes no time in phoning lawyers and involving the FBI in tracking down the shots of the underage Kourtney.",4,A guilty pleasure...,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,3804,"['KEEPING', 'UP', 'WITH', 'THE', 'KARDASHIANS', 'something', 'should', ""n't"", 'like', '[', 'obviously', 'scripted', 'being', 'flogged', 'fly-on-the-wall', 'show', ']', 'watch', 'anyway.The', 'Kardashian', 'family', 'are', 'Mum', 'Kris', 'Jenner', 'Her', 'husband', 'Bruce', '[', 'Olympic', 'gold', 'medal', 'winner', ']', 'Kris', 'older', 'children', 'Kourtney', 'Kimberly', 'Khloe', 'Robert', '[', 'father', 'late', 'L.A.', 'power', 'attorney', 'Robert', 'Kardashian', ']', 'Kris', 'Bruce', 'daughters', 'Kylie', 'Kendall.Most', 'episodes', 'center', 'Kim', '[', 'one', 'T', 'A', 'own', 'best-selling', 'sex', 'tape', ']', 'actually', 'boring', 'very', 'me-me-me', 'keeping', 'referring', 'famous', 'recording', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'just', 'known', ""'the"", 'girl', 'sex', 'tape', 'point', 'Robert', 'weak', 'link', 'nice', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'when', ""he'sonscreen"", 'luckily', 'away', 'uni', 'most', 'viewing', 'Khloe', 'sense', 'humour', 'hilarious', 'whenever', 'up', 'Kourtney', 'know', 'bound', 'be', 'something', 'worth', 'watching', 'happen', 'Khloe', 'standout', 'show', 'Kourtney', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'now', 'have', 'spin', 'off', 'show', '[', 'Kourtney', 'Khloe', 'Take', 'Miami', ']', 'too', 'often', 'show', 'ratings', 'US.Bruce', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'often', 'drowned', 'out', 'girls', 'shame', 'Momager', 'Kris', 'much', 'more', 'likable', 'then', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'feisty', 'Kylie', 'Kendall', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', ""'re"", 'early', 'teens', 'think', 'Bruce', 'Kris', 'are', 'being', 'responsible', 'limiting', 'exposure.Episode', '1', ""'m"", 'Watching', 'YouKim', 'first', 'big', 'TV', 'interview', 'where', ""'ll"", 'have', 'discuss', 'sex', 'tape', 'everyone', 'set', 'up', 'anniversary', 'party', 'Bruce', 'Kris.Episode', '2', 'Managing', 'MomBeing', 'busy', 'working', 'mum', '[', 'store', 'manager', 'Bruce', 'as', 'well', 'Kim', ']', 'take', 'tole', 'Kris', 'nanny', 'Meanwhile', 'Kim', 'firing', 'manager.Episode', '3', 'Brody', 'HouseAs', 'girls', 'Rob', 'go', 'Mexico', 'saucy', 'shoot', 'Bruce', 'told', ""'re"", 'taking', 'vacation', 'When', 'out', ""'re"", 'doing', 'shoot', 'swimwear', 'range', 'owned', 'creator', ""'Girls"", 'Gone', 'Wild', 'asks', 'son', 'Brody', 'Jenner', 'stay', 'family', 'home', 'look', 'Kylie', 'Kendall.Episode', '4', 'Birthday', 'SuitPlayboy', 'ask', 'Kim', 'pose', 'much', 'Bruce', 'dismay', 'Why', 'ask', 'opinion', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'anyway', 'Kim', 'only', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'take', 'clothes', 'Playboy', 'do', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', '5', 'Remembering', 'DadAs', 'anniversary', 'father', 'death', 'approaches', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'Khloe', 'arrested', 'DUI', 'Luckily', 'camera', 'crew', 'are', 'hand', 'recreate', 'drama', 'Literally', 'even', 'disclaimer', 'start', 'episode', 'disclosing', 'episode', 'recreations', 'actual', 'events', 'See', 'Not', 'scripted', 'pure', 'reality', 'Episode', '6', 'Are', 'So', 'Pregnant', 'Dude', 'Kourtney', 'pregnancy', 'test', 'wild', 'weekend', 'girls', '[', 'Rob', ']', 'Vegas', 'will', 'classy', 'Vegas', 'wedding', 'be', 'involved', 'one', 'Meanwhile', 'Kris', 'Kendall', 'puppy', 'keep', 'poor', 'Bruce', 'who', 'said', 'Episode', '7', 'Helping', 'HandKhloe', 'Kris', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'homeless', 'man', 'girls', 'store', 'told', 'show', 'compassion', 'Kourtney', 'take', 'family', 'home', 'clean', 'up.Episode', '8', 'Price', 'FameKim', 'devastated', 'when', 'old', 'photos', 'stole', 'later', 'misplaced', 'Kourtney', 'teenager', 'wind', 'up', 'wrong', 'hands', 'Kourtney', 'be', 'next', 'Kardashian', ""'Superstar"", 'Kris', 'time', 'phoning', 'lawyers', 'involving', 'FBI', 'tracking', 'down', 'shots', 'underage', 'Kourtney']",Keeping Up with the Kardashians: Season 1

This reality show chronicles the daily lives of the famous-for-being-famous Kardashians, but it's so painfully contrived and scripted that it feels like a really dull sitcom, starring a really creepy family.So, the family in question involves sex-tape socialite Kim Kardashian and her equally vapid sisters Kourtney and Khloe, her creepy brother Robert (who comments on ""hot"" nude pictures of his own sister... eww!), flaky younger half-sisters Kylie and Kendalls, freaky stage-mom Kris (who pressures her daughter into a nude Playboy shoot), and Kris' long-suffering husband Bruce Jenner.So as the series goes on, they deal with sexy nannies, photo shoots (both Girls Gone Wild and Playboy), Kris' defects as a manager, Khloe getting arrested for a DUI on the anniversary of her father's death, makeovers for the homeless, puppies, a pregnancy scare, a near-wedding in Vegas, and a FBI investigation into Kourtney's leaked sex photos.""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" is allegedly a reality show, but I'm not really sure about that. It's painfully and obviously clear that everything in this show is scripted, without a single moment of spontaneity. Even worse, it's BORING -- most of it is about the family hanging around complaining, posing sexily, or partying.Plus, every episode has a crisis that is tidily resolved and never referred to again (Khloe's DUI). And they have some kind of moral at the end like ""lying to your spouse is bad,"" ""kindness is good,"" ""driving and driving is bad,"" etc. Is this a sitcom?It doesn't help that few people in the Jenner/Kardashian family are really likable; you end up feeling sorry for Bruce Jenner for having to deal with this on a daily basis. Kim, Kourtney and Khloe are all vapid, whiny and hopelessly spoiled, and none of them seem to be able to show ANY convincing emotions (Kourtney experiences a pregnancy scare, a near-wedding AND a sex scandal... but never changes expression).Worst of all is Kris, the reptilian stage-mom -- one hilarious scene has her pretending to cry over her ex-husband's death, dabbing at the corners of her perfectly made-up, dry eyes. Seriously, was the intent to make us hate her? She repeatedly lies to her husband, and constantly tries to sexually peddle her daughters to the public!""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" is a tedious reality-sitcom that never lets you forget that everything is scripted, especially since none of the Kardashians can act.

This is only a short season, but you get a good idea about their life and I can't wait to see season 2.This is the way this season pans out.1 - I'M WATCHING YOU - The family throws an anniversary party for Mom and Dad, while Kim talks about her s.x tape on the Tyra show.2 - MANAGING MOM - Kris hires a nanny to help around the house, while Kim contemplates firing her mom as her manager.3 - BRODY IN THE HOUSE - Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Frances gets the Kardashian gals to model his new bikini line, while Brody Jenner babysits the kids.4 - BIRTHDAY SUIT - Kim bares her bootylicious body for a Playboy spread.5 - REMEMBERING DAD - As the anniversary of her dad's death approaches, Khloe stars to spiral out of control.6 - YOU ARE SO PREGNANT DUDE - The girls set out for Sin City.  Kourtney gets the results of a pregnancy test.7 - HELPING HAND - The family takes in a homeless man, and Rob goes on a date with a Playboy Playmate.8 - THE PRICE OF FAME - Another s.x scandal rocks the Kardashian household.While these girls aren't the ideal role models for kids out there, if you treat this as fluff and not the way you'd like to live your life, then this show is fine.  I enjoy it purely for the entertainment factor and as I said, the family as a whole is likeable.  I love their quaint house and the love you see that they all share.  It's a great escapism show and I really like it.",5,Why so addictive :-0,1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,1919,"['programms', 'hook', 'can', 'not', 'look', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'get', 'things', 'one', 'fun', 'light', 'addictive.Kim', 'really', 'only', 'famous', 'being', 'friend', 'ex', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'however', 'now', 'show', 'getting', 'more', 'recognition', 'even', 'DWTS', 'show', 'mainly', 'then', 'other', 'K', 'sisters', 'Kourtney', 'Khloe', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'likeable', 'family', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'ditzy', ""'d"", 'think', 'only', 'short', 'season', 'get', 'good', 'idea', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'season', '2.This', 'way', 'season', 'out.1', ""'M"", 'YOU', 'family', 'anniversary', 'party', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'Kim', 'talks', 's.x', 'tape', 'Tyra', 'show.2', 'MANAGING', 'MOM', 'Kris', 'nanny', 'help', 'house', 'Kim', 'firing', 'mom', 'manager.3', 'BRODY', 'THE', 'HOUSE', 'Girls', 'Gone', 'Wild', 'creator', 'Joe', 'Frances', 'Kardashian', 'gals', 'model', 'new', 'bikini', 'line', 'Brody', 'Jenner', 'kids.4', 'BIRTHDAY', 'SUIT', 'Kim', 'bootylicious', 'body', 'Playboy', 'spread.5', 'REMEMBERING', 'DAD', 'anniversary', 'dad', 'death', 'approaches', 'Khloe', 'spiral', 'control.6', 'YOU', 'ARE', 'SO', 'PREGNANT', 'DUDE', 'girls', 'set', 'out', 'Sin', 'City', 'Kourtney', 'results', 'pregnancy', 'test.7', 'HELPING', 'HAND', 'family', 'homeless', 'man', 'Rob', 'date', 'Playboy', 'Playmate.8', 'PRICE', 'OF', 'FAME', 's.x', 'scandal', 'Kardashian', 'household.While', 'girls', 'are', ""n't"", 'ideal', 'role', 'models', 'kids', 'there', 'treat', 'fluff', 'not', 'way', ""'d"", 'like', 'live', 'life', 'then', 'show', 'fine', 'enjoy', 'purely', 'entertainment', 'factor', 'said', 'family', 'whole', 'likeable', 'love', 'quaint', 'house', 'love', 'see', 'share', 'great', 'escapism', 'show', 'really']",Keeping Up with the Kardashians: Season 1

This show is actually somewhat amusing in its offensiveness. Not South Park or Family Guy offensiveness, mind you; stupid offensiveness. Offensive to the extent that you almost feel your IQ dropping as you watch it.To go out on a limb, it is probably pretty accurate to suggest that this show was, to some extent, the brainchild of Kris Jenner, the ""mom"" of the family who also prides herself in being her daughter's manager. If ever there was a human being who needs to live vicariously through her family, it is Kris Jenner. Her behavior, whether scripted or not, is inappropriate for someone her age (or, for that matter, any age). Her husband, Bruce Jenner, seems to be along for the ride, expressing more conservative views, but still clearly satisfied by the pseudo-celebrity fame this show brings him. Interestingly, Bruce is the closest thing to a real celebrity in this show thanks to an Olympic win several years ago.The real reason to watch Kardashians is because of the three older daughters. If you could bottle up shallowness and compress it into a trilogy of people, these three are it. They all come off as thinking that they are indeed celebrities when the reality is totally different. Kim is known because of a ""leaked"" sex tape a few years ago, and her sisters are known because of this show at best.As for the DVD, the product presents no more than what is seen on E!. It contains the censored broadcast version of the show, and offers little in the way of extras.
