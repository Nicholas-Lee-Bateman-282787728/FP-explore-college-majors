1424722,ASXW7UQXGMNJL,B004QOB8O8,"Alan A. Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[1, 1]","This entertaining series looks at the Borgia family that played a central role in Renaissance Italy's politics and history. The central figure is Rodrigo Borgia, who as the series begins, manages to buy himself election as Pope Alexander VI. This is an age of church corruption in personal as well as political terms. Borgia, brilliantly portrayed by Jeremy Irons, has four children by his Spanish mistress but has tired of her and takes up with the beautiful Guila Farnese.Borgia has forced his older son, Cesare, to join the church and soon elevates him to become a cardinal despite his total lack of religious vocation. His second son is a mediocre soldier and he marries off his daughter, Lucrezia, to form a military alliance with the powerful Sforza family. Lucrezia's husband is not only much older but also coarse and cruel.As the plot unfolds, we get poisonings, rape, adultery, whippings, stabbings, battles and colorful characters galore. I don't know enough history to be able to tell how accurate the series is. But is undeniably great entertainment, well acted and gorgeously designed. The director and his team have brought the Renaissance to life to the point that one often feels as if one is watching a series of paintings from the period by Raphael or Botticelli being animated.

1424725,AB4F6UHL20U95,B004QOB8O8,Anne Rice,"[17, 19]","When confronted with this beautiful and brilliantly conceived  series, one has to confess that neither historical accuracy or the limitations of television much matter.  The brilliant Neil Jordan who created, wrote and directed these episodes has made this his own rich and meaningful and unforgettable material.  You don't go to Shakespeare's Hamlet or his Macbeth or his King Lear  to learn history;  you go to them to be with Shakespeare in his world and see how he uses history to construct his universe.  Well, that is what is happening here.  Jordan has made The Borgias his own mad universe in which he can talk about good and evil, humanity and cruelty as he wants to do it, and his dialogue and staging and vision is what matters.  I find the series (I have now seen all of season two which will soon be released on DVD if it isn't already) horrifying and mesmerizing. I cannot look away from it though it drags me to places I don't want to go.  And I sense without even thinking about it that this is like no other programming on television at this time.  It is so extreme, so fully realized, so uncompromising, and so intelligent  that it is in a class by itself.  Of course the actors and actresses are superb.  The cinematography and art direction surpass anything I've seen on the small screen; and the entire look of the series is Renaissance in its colors and proportions.  It is entertaining?  I honestly don't know. When something is this riveting and contains this much cruelty I don't know if it's entertaining.

Marold""","[0, 0]","There is probably very little I can say which has not already been said by many reviewers, so I will not bother with details much, and only give my visceral reaction. My first impression is that Jeremy Irons is about as good as you would expect him to be. And, there is a sense that he must be, because the Borgia pope is not the character about whom we hear the most in our brief encounters with history. We hear much about Lucrezia Borgia and a bit less about Cesare Borgia, but not so much about Rodrigo, who became Pope Alexander VI. The actors playing Cesare and Lucretia are not well known, but Derek Jacobi makes his obligatory appearance in a few early scenes to bring attention to the cardinals who were willing to murder Rodrigo. By far the most interesting character, by his being familiar to us from his writing, is Niccolo Machiavelli, a senior advisor to the powerful de Medici family of Florence.For some reason, it took a long time to sort out all the characters. That may be because most of them were cardinals with similar sounding Italian names. It was hard to remember which were the allies of Rodrigo, and which were his enemies. The story seems relatively ingrown for a number of episodes until two events in the middle and the end of the season. The first is the marriage of Lucrezia Borgia to an important noble for political gain. This takes the scene out of Rome for a bit. The second is when the French king, Charles VIII and his army enter the story. But unlike ""I, Claudius"" and parts of the series ""Rome"", none of the characters seem to rise into the realm of ""larger than life"".

1424738,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B004QOB8O8,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","This is great entertainment.  Jeremy Irons is absolutely great playing the role of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia who becomes Pope Alexander VI.  He was the perfect choice to play a man who is brilliant, politically astute, ambitious, lusty, and strategically places members of his family in the various illustrious families of Italy through arranged marriages. I have read several books on the Borgia family and their rise to power and this series, whereas it takes some liberties with the actual facts, for the most part reveals the power dynamics of the Italian peninsula. If anyone wishes to read a short, accurate summary of the Renaissance papacy of Alexander VI, I would suggest the chapter on the Borgias in Will Durant&#8217;s book, The Renaissance.The film is all about power politics even if there are passages around sexual affairs and the rivalries and tensions within the Borgia family. The Papal States were those lands that belonged to the Papacy and that fell between Tuscany, often ruled by the Medici; the Marshes, often ruled by the Sforza family; and the Kingdom of Naples.  The rural Papal States were often actually dominated by feudal dukes who had only tentative allegiance to the papacy.  Rome was dominated by a range of noble families, such as the Orsini, and all of the major families had relatives who were cardinals, the princes of the Church, and thus were contenders to become pope.The Borgia family was actually Catalan and Rodrigo Borgia had a mistress and children when his uncle, a pope, named him as a cardinal and he came to Rome. At age 26 he was the vice-chancellor of the papacy, which means he was in charge of the entire curia around the world. This is the second most powerful position in the Vatican.  He must have been a superb manager and politician to survive the infighting within the Vatican and after 30 years become Pope Alexander VI.Alexander VI begins to make political alliances, sealed with the marriages of his children, to build a network of allies to support his papacy. In this way he acts as any secular prince. However, Durant&#8217;s book points out the evidence that Alexander VI was also a religious man. This series depicts Alexander as a Christian despite his considerable skills at consolidating power. Jeremy Irons is beyond fantastic at being able to show the multiple facets of this fascinating character from history.The series also depicts the rivalry between Alexander VI and Cardinal Della Rovere (who later becomes Pope Julius II who commissioned Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel). Colm Feore plays this role very well since he must play a man of God who also has considerable political skills and sees the Borgia family as an insult on the Papacy and thus sees himself as the necessary antidote to their excesses.Alexander VI had an illegitimate son, Cesare Borgia, who he makes into a Cardinal. However history tells us that Cesare had considerable military skills. This is not explored in the first season of the series and we see Cesare struggling to implement the duties of a Prince of the Church while having an affair with a married woman and having to endure his braggadocios younger brother Juan with whom the Pope has placed the responsibility of military protection of the Papacy and Vatican. Francois Arnaud plays the role well of a smart but passionate man whose loyalty to his father is strained and tested often.Younger son Juan is played well by David Oakes but a major role has been assigned to daughter Lucrezia, played by Holliday Grainger. In fact, the disastrous first marriage of Lucrezia is a major theme in the first season.  We know from history that Lucrezia Borgia was a complex and highly intelligent character. In the first season we begin to see the emergence of her diplomatic skills. The costumes, settings, and other details are very well done.

It's fascinating to see the Renaissance evoked so immediately.  I'm not a Jeremy Irons fan but he's perfect for his role as the Borgia patriarch and as pope.  The violent power plays almost make our current political climate seem calm.  Though modern day political dreams may be slaughtered as often as the 15th century the bodies don't accumulate quite as quickly.Holliday Grainger is ethereal as Lucrezia with her blonde hair and subtle makeup she looks like the 14 year old she's portraying.  In the beginning of the series she's believable as an innocent child though not vacuous, as the series progresses she's also believable as a young wife who's too quickly learning how cruel the world can be.  She's no longer only an adored daughter but an awakening power in her own right.Another stand out in the cast is Francoise Arnaud.  He's the eldest Borgia son his father has assigned him the role of cardinal as such he acts as his father's political eyes and ears.  Cesare choose to act as the family protector and behind the scenes plotter.  Arnaud's eyes are haunting and he uses them to convey volumes.

1424743,A3C1Q9TRP83BYB,B004QOB8O8,Daniel A. Brown,"[15, 22]","Wishing to capitalize on its far superior historical series ""The Tudors"", Showtime has released ""The Borgias"" but misses a golden opportunity to delve into one of the most notorious families in European history. Spectacularly notorious as it were: The Borgia trio of father, son and daughter took murder, sex and intrigue to breathtaking heights. To truly understand what the viewer is missing, I suggest reading ""A World Lit Only by Fire"" by famed historian William Manchester who relates the saga of Pope Alexander VI (whom Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia would become) and his naughty children, Lucrezia and Cesare Borgia.That sentence alone should raise an eyebrow or two. Alexander not only fathered several children but was such a sybaritic sexual aficionado that the philandering exploits of today's politicians pale by comparison. He not only seduced women on their wedding nights after he had officiated their nuptials (to other men) but was known to stage orgiastic sex contests in the Vatican itself. His true depravity concerns his incestuous relationship with his gorgeous daughter Lucrezia who, when not sharing her father's bed (in which she would eventually sire a child of her own), was rapturously entwined with her brother Cesare who in turn, murdered their other brother, Juan, in a jealous rage. This while wearing the robes of Cardinal. Machiavelli based his cynical treatise, ""The Prince"" on him.""Christian Family Values"", Renaissance Style.Considering this juicy material, one would have expected Showtime to have a rollicking ball with it. Unfortunately, the series chooses to dwell more on political intrigue, financial knavery and shadowy assassinations. These were bad enough. The Catholic Church by 1492 (when ""The Borgias"" begins) was a cesspool of corruption and venality, the likes of which eventually brought about the Protestant Reformation. The Borgias on screen function like an extreme version of Goldman-Sachs, plotting and scheming for power and filthy lucre. After the fifth stabbed, poisoned or garroted rival gets dispatched, however, the theme wears thin.""The Borgias"" is not helped by leading man, Jeremy Irons who portrays the lusty Pope Alexander as gloomily as he did Humbert Humbert in ""Lolita"". His air of heaviness is reinforced by the awful soundtrack of canonical chants that grate on the ears. Seeing how unrestrained the real family was at the turn of the 16th century, it is a disappointment that the Borgias on screen refuse to follow suit.",2,"Christian Family Values, Renaissance Style",1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,2488,"['Wishing', 'capitalize', 'far', 'superior', 'historical', 'series', 'Tudors', 'Showtime', 'released', 'Borgias', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'delve', 'one', 'most', 'notorious', 'families', 'European', 'history', 'Spectacularly', 'notorious', 'were', 'Borgia', 'trio', 'father', 'son', 'daughter', 'took', 'murder', 'sex', 'intrigue', 'breathtaking', 'heights', 'truly', 'understand', 'what', 'viewer', 'missing', 'suggest', 'reading', 'A', 'World', 'Lit', 'Only', 'Fire', 'famed', 'historian', 'William', 'Manchester', 'who', 'saga', 'Pope', 'Alexander', 'VI', 'whom', 'Cardinal', 'Rodrigo', 'Borgia', 'would', 'become', 'naughty', 'children', 'Lucrezia', 'Cesare', 'Borgia.That', 'sentence', 'alone', 'should', 'raise', 'eyebrow', 'two', 'Alexander', 'not', 'only', 'fathered', 'several', 'children', 'was', 'such', 'sybaritic', 'sexual', 'aficionado', 'philandering', 'exploits', 'today', 'politicians', 'pale', 'comparison', 'not', 'only', 'seduced', 'women', 'wedding', 'nights', 'had', 'officiated', 'nuptials', 'other', 'men', 'was', 'known', 'stage', 'orgiastic', 'sex', 'contests', 'Vatican', 'true', 'depravity', 'concerns', 'incestuous', 'relationship', 'gorgeous', 'daughter', 'Lucrezia', 'who', 'when', 'not', 'sharing', 'father', 'bed', 'would', 'eventually', 'sire', 'child', 'own', 'was', 'rapturously', 'entwined', 'brother', 'Cesare', 'who', 'turn', 'murdered', 'other', 'brother', 'Juan', 'jealous', 'rage', 'wearing', 'robes', 'Cardinal', 'Machiavelli', 'based', 'cynical', 'treatise', 'Prince', 'Christian', 'Family', 'Values', 'Renaissance', 'Style.Considering', 'juicy', 'material', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'Showtime', 'have', 'rollicking', 'ball', 'Unfortunately', 'series', 'dwell', 'more', 'political', 'intrigue', 'financial', 'knavery', 'shadowy', 'assassinations', 'were', 'bad', 'enough', 'Catholic', 'Church', '1492', 'when', 'Borgias', 'was', 'cesspool', 'corruption', 'venality', 'likes', 'eventually', 'brought', 'Protestant', 'Reformation', 'Borgias', 'screen', 'function', 'extreme', 'version', 'Goldman-Sachs', 'plotting', 'scheming', 'power', 'filthy', 'lucre', 'fifth', 'stabbed', 'poisoned', 'garroted', 'rival', 'dispatched', 'however', 'theme', 'thin', 'Borgias', 'not', 'helped', 'leading', 'man', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'who', 'lusty', 'Pope', 'Alexander', 'as', 'gloomily', 'did', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'Lolita', 'air', 'heaviness', 'reinforced', 'awful', 'soundtrack', 'canonical', 'chants', 'grate', 'ears', 'Seeing', 'how', 'unrestrained', 'real', 'family', 'was', 'turn', '16th', 'century', 'disappointment', 'Borgias', 'screen', 'refuse', 'follow', 'suit']",N/A

1424756,A2XR3I3HASE747,B004QOB8O8,esplicito con beige,"[1, 3]","""The Borgias"" is the story of Renaissance godfather Rodrigo Borgia, who rises through prevarication and murder, ""simony and public lewdness"" from his humble origins as a Spanish immigrant to the highest office in all of Christendom, the papacy.The costumes, reconstruction of historic Italian cities (the series is actually shot in Hungary), and filming are all gorgeous.  Another great strength is the flawless casting of Rodrigo's illegitimate children:  The condottiere Juan is deliciously slimy and weak, sacrificial lamb Lucrezia a fearsome marriage of sweetness and scheming, the cardinal Cesare bold, brooding and ambitious as his father.  I pictured Rodrigo Borgia, aka Pope Alexander VI, as more plump and jolly, a sort of renaissance-era Berlusconi.  Jeremy Irons as the Borgia pope alternates between distracted and campy, and I rather wish he had given himself over to the campy side completely.For what this series lacks, in my eyes, is the sense of humor that made HBO's ""Rome"" (for example) so much fun to watch.  The entire ""Borgias"" cast--even characters we are supposed to accept as illiterate servants--speaks the Queen's English beautifully, with accents so crisp you are afraid of getting a paper cut.  These Brits would be flawless as Tudors, believable as the stiffly correct classical Romans, but their impersonation of modern Italians fails as miserably as a passel of nuns passing themselves off as marauding Cossacks.  I've known many Romans, and they tend towards boisterous and proud, are poetic with their hands, burst into song for no reason, and poke fun at you most of the time.  (They also know how to pronounce the names of cities like PEsaro).  Even severe Cardinal della Rovere, Alexander's main rival for the papacy, must have been more fun than the humorless robot this show makes him out to be--much as I imagine Savonorola's impassioned screeds must have been far more entertaining in real life.A second fault is that the characters seem to lack an inner life of their own.  Their actions appear driven by the need to satisfy the artificial demands of a script rather than by actual convictions or values.  Why is Rodrigo so desperate to be pope?  Why does Giulia Farnese agree to be his mistress?  Why does Micheletto so quickly transfer his allegiances to the Borgia family?  What draws Cesare to the unhappy blond woman?  Given his disdain for the pope, why would Giovanni Sforza marry Lucrezia?  What happens if you do not address Giulia Farnese by her full name?  Questions like these are never addressed.Despite these problems, ""The Borgias"" is definitely a guilty pleasure, like ""Rome"" and ""The Tudors"" before it.",3,a guilty pleasure,1338076800,"05 27, 2012",2012,2661,"['Borgias', 'story', 'Renaissance', 'godfather', 'Rodrigo', 'Borgia', 'who', 'prevarication', 'murder', 'simony', 'public', 'lewdness', 'humble', 'origins', 'Spanish', 'immigrant', 'highest', 'office', 'Christendom', 'papacy.The', 'costumes', 'reconstruction', 'historic', 'Italian', 'cities', 'series', 'actually', 'shot', 'Hungary', 'filming', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'great', 'strength', 'flawless', 'casting', 'Rodrigo', 'illegitimate', 'children', 'condottiere', 'Juan', 'deliciously', 'slimy', 'weak', 'sacrificial', 'lamb', 'Lucrezia', 'fearsome', 'marriage', 'sweetness', 'scheming', 'cardinal', 'Cesare', 'bold', 'brooding', 'ambitious', 'father', 'pictured', 'Rodrigo', 'Borgia', 'Pope', 'Alexander', 'VI', 'more', 'plump', 'jolly', 'sort', 'renaissance-era', 'Berlusconi', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Borgia', 'pope', 'distracted', 'campy', 'rather', 'wish', 'had', 'given', 'campy', 'side', 'completely.For', 'what', 'series', 'eyes', 'sense', 'humor', 'made', 'HBO', 'Rome', 'example', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'entire', 'Borgias', 'cast', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'supposed', 'accept', 'illiterate', 'servants', 'Queen', 'English', 'beautifully', 'accents', 'so', 'crisp', 'are', 'afraid', 'getting', 'paper', 'cut', 'Brits', 'would', 'be', 'flawless', 'Tudors', 'believable', 'stiffly', 'correct', 'classical', 'Romans', 'impersonation', 'modern', 'Italians', 'as', 'miserably', 'passel', 'nuns', 'passing', 'off', 'marauding', 'Cossacks', ""'ve"", 'known', 'many', 'Romans', 'tend', 'towards', 'boisterous', 'proud', 'are', 'poetic', 'hands', 'burst', 'song', 'reason', 'poke', 'fun', 'most', 'time', 'also', 'know', 'how', 'pronounce', 'names', 'cities', 'PEsaro', 'Even', 'severe', 'Cardinal', 'della', 'Rovere', 'Alexander', 'main', 'rival', 'papacy', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fun', 'humorless', 'robot', 'show', 'out', 'be', 'much', 'imagine', 'Savonorola', 'impassioned', 'screeds', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'entertaining', 'real', 'life.A', 'second', 'fault', 'characters', 'seem', 'lack', 'inner', 'life', 'own', 'actions', 'appear', 'driven', 'need', 'satisfy', 'artificial', 'demands', 'script', 'rather', 'actual', 'convictions', 'values', 'Why', 'Rodrigo', 'so', 'desperate', 'be', 'pope', 'Why', 'Giulia', 'Farnese', 'agree', 'be', 'mistress', 'Why', 'Micheletto', 'so', 'quickly', 'transfer', 'allegiances', 'Borgia', 'family', 'What', 'Cesare', 'unhappy', 'blond', 'woman', 'Given', 'disdain', 'pope', 'why', 'would', 'Giovanni', 'Sforza', 'marry', 'Lucrezia', 'What', 'do', 'not', 'address', 'Giulia', 'Farnese', 'full', 'name', 'Questions', 'are', 'never', 'problems', 'Borgias', 'definitely', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Rome', 'Tudors']",N/A

It was a time when the papacy was in disrepair with popes having wives and mistresses and all manner of scandal (sound oddly familiar...) and from this period in history highly regarded writer Neil Jordan has pasted together enough information about the infamous Borgias  - 'the first crime family' according to the PR - to create what resulted in a fascinating account of world history, a fitting series whose first season of 9 episodes are tied together in this package of DVDs.For starters, the opening title sequences are masterworks of graphics and art history albeit splatter or washed in blood.  The series opens with the nefarious Spanish family taking over the important Roman power vested in the papacy: Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia (Jeremy Irons in a splendid tour de force of acting),  becomes  Pope Alexander VI when Pope Innocent VIII dies.  As Pope, the elder Borgia gains election of his son Cesare (Franois Arnaud, a stunningly gifted young and handsome actor in one of his very first roles) to the College of Cardinals while his other son, the libidinous Juan (David Oakes) is made head of the military: these sons and the daughter Lucrezia (Holliday Grainger) are the children by the pope's 'wife' Vanozza Cattaneo (Joanne Whaley), though the pope is now in the throes of a sordid relationship with Giulia Farnese (Lotte Verbeek). One cardinal -  Giuliano Della Rovere (Colm Feore) - is out to depose the unctuous Borgia reign and works with outside forces to overthrow Pope Alexander VI and makes alliances with  King Charles VIII of France (Michel Muller).  In the meantime Lucrezia is married off to the rather piggish Giovanni Sforza (Ronan Vibert) for monetary gain for the papacy but prefers sleeping with the illiterate commoner groomsman Paulo (Luke Pasqualino).  Cesare appears to be the wisest of the descendants (despite a love affair with a married woman)  but the entire family wiles its way into the role of oily evil that sets the stage for the episodes to follow.The cast is uniformly excellent: there are cameo roles for the likes of Derek Jacobi, Sean Harris, Steven Berkoff, etc.  The settings and costumes are enormously successful and the pacing of the action is fast - but not too fast to pause here and there for some rather graphic sensual scenes and gross and bloody fighting.  it has the flavor of the times down to a fare-thee-well, making us eager for the next season to begin.

I like historical series' and being unable to see either Rome or The Tudors because I couldn't view them with XFinity On Demand without othe risk of one of my strict family members catching me viewing it, I didn't.

Weaver ""karlweaver""","[0, 0]","Showtime produced three seasons of episodes of &#34;The Borgias&#34; and now they are all available, on DVD or on Blu-Ray.My biggest single complaint would have to be why they couldn't spend a few extra dollars to put subtitles on the discs.It's not that much to ask but no, none of them have subtitles.The series is based on the actual history of the Borgia family, at the time when one of them was Pope Alexander VI,during the Renaissance (including what was dubbed the &#34;Jubilee&#34; year 1500 AD).  Some characters are omitted/compressed/altered a bit, in the interest of keeping the cast of characters limited enough to maintain interest in allof them, but all of the significant characters in the series were real people and did the kinds of things that aredepicted.Most of it is filmed in Hungary but one can believe that the Vatican is the main setting.  The costuming is (as usualin lavish period pieces) exquisitely beautiful, depicting more or less what royalty and nobility of the time wouldhave looked like, and the architecture is equally splendid.  The story depicts a family of enormous ambition andunscrupulous means, but then pretty much everyone in a position of power seems to have been much the same.There is much discreet depiction of sexual encounters, usually with partial nudity (at least once, in season 3 thereis full frontal male nudity but never full female); some swearing, and lots of fighting (both person-to-person andin larger battles) but without gratuitous gore.  Episodes of torture are depicted well enough to know what isgoing on, but without dwelling on them overly long.  One does become attached to the characters, despite alltheir flaws.  In the end I think it makes a well-told story; one which shows no purely good nor purely evil characters,but people as they were, some mixture of the two.

1424781,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004QOB8O8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 11]","Talk about niche programming. When the successful Showtime series ""The Tudors"" came to a conclusion last year (after all, Henry VIII could only have so many lives and wives), the network didn't miss a beat in creating a program that would appeal to a similar demographic. ""The Borgias"" tackles an equally well known historical personage and gives the notorious Pope and his clan a sumptuous dramatization. Helmed by Neil Jordan, a writer/director whose ""The Crying Game"" won him a screenplay Oscar, the show further stacked the deck with the brilliant casting coup of Jeremy Irons in the lead role. The show highlights the entire family, not just patriarch Rodrigo Borgia, and showcases the seamy underbelly of corruption, manipulation, and brutality that have made the name synonymous with criminal enterprise. In fact, the family's reputation for ruthlessness inspired Mario Puzo's to mold the characters featured in ""The Godfather"" after the real life Borgias.With the first season of the show only running nine episodes, however, the full scope of the Borgia legacy is merely introduced. The premiere starts with the death of the reigning Pope, which leaves a vacancy that ambitious Cardinal Rodrigo (Irons) intends to claim at any price. Through back room deals and other nefarious deeds, Rodrigo ascends to power while making an enemy of Cardinal Della Rovere (a solid Colm Feore)--an act that will have long range repercussions as the exiled Cardinal aligns with outside forces to unseat the Pope. Appointing son Cesare (Francois Arnaud) as a Cardinal, son Juan (David Oakes) to military leadership, and arranging an advantageous marriage for daughter Lucrezia (Holliday Grainger)--the Pope is establishing a well protected position. Each child plays their part to precision as they deal with personal drama, romance, and intrigue. The show progresses with the Pope's position becoming more precarious as the French Army marches through Italy with its sights on Rome. This is a primary story arc as the season reaches its conclusion.In every regard, ""The Borgias"" is a terrific technical production. The sets, costumes, and period details all look great. The action sequences, especially when it comes to the battlefield, are tense and brutal--with superb effects. The screenplays are smart--allowing a slow build tension and actual character development that heightens the impending drama. It's great to have Irons back in a prominent leading role as he seems to have been wallowing in cheesy supporting turns for quite some time. Arnaud has a quiet intensity as, perhaps, the show's most intriguing and complex character. And Grainger has a subtlety that gets under your skin--before you know what happened, she has transformed into a sly power player. But the cast is uniformly excellent with even smaller roles well delineated.I commonly look to cable and premium cable networks to provide more surprising and sophisticated entertainment, and Showtime has done an excellent job structuring a program for adult viewers. With these historical dramas, there will always be a contingent of people who will chime in on details of precise historical accuracy. I make no claims that this show is one hundred percent accurate, but it is certainly an effective and entertaining dramatization. If you enjoy lush period pieces, there is a lot to admire in ""The Borgias"" and that makes it an easy recommendation.

I tend to be quite picky with what I read and watch about them, because I dislike when there are too many liberties taken with the historical facts.As such I originally expected I would hate this TV series and steered clear from it for a while. I had seen a few excerpts and was unimpressed.But when it became available on Amazon video on demand, the curiosity and the temptation to watch it made me try anyway. I purchased just one episode to try out the waters and see if it was worth watching or not. Immediately after seeing it, I purchased the whole season and was glued to the screen watching the whole thing in a marathon throughout the night.Much to my surprise, it was an extremely pleasant and entertaining watch. I'm strongly looking forward to the second season.They do take a colossal amount of liberties with historical fact, and while I can understand and approve of some of those for the sake of tv-series-format storytelling (you can't have everything accurate if it would blow the budget and leave you with 300 episode series, sadly), some of the changes just make no sense whatsoever.But for the most part, those changes are not so unpleasant as to decrease my enjoyment of the series. And with the most important elements for each character being present there (for the most part), it's not that far from the historical Borgia, especially considering the liberties film-makers have always traditionally taken with anything Borgia-related. (That family's extreme potential for dramatic film-making doesn't help, and as a result us sticklers for accuracy rarely find something truly ""right"".)Normally, if I'm constantly frowning and going ""this wasn't supposed to happen this way!"" throughout a whole a period piece movie or episode, I generally won't enjoy it. However, this series proved to be so enjoyable that I was able to get into it and be entertained enough that I would ignore the inaccuracies.I would say that if you can overlook the liberties taken for storytelling etc., I definitely recommend the TV series as a very enjoyable must-watch for any Borgia fans. I'm glad Amazon has the option to actually purchase the video-on-demand instead of just renting it, as I will definitely be rewatching it.Also, the costumes and backgrounds are gorgeous, (even if not always accurate either). And the actors who play Cesare, Lucrezia and some of the others are quite the impressive eye-candy, which is always a bonus as well... ;)",4,Far better than I had expected.,1324252800,"12 19, 2011",2011,2598,"['First', 'little', 'background', ""'m"", 'history', 'aficionado', 'very', 'fond', 'time', 'period', 'history', 'myths', 'surrounding', 'Borgia', 'family', 'tend', 'be', 'quite', 'picky', 'what', 'read', 'watch', 'dislike', 'when', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'liberties', 'taken', 'historical', 'facts.As', 'such', 'originally', 'expected', 'would', 'hate', 'TV', 'series', 'steered', 'clear', 'while', 'had', 'seen', 'few', 'excerpts', 'was', 'unimpressed.But', 'when', 'became', 'available', 'Amazon', 'video', 'demand', 'curiosity', 'temptation', 'watch', 'made', 'try', 'anyway', 'purchased', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'try', 'out', 'waters', 'see', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'Immediately', 'seeing', 'purchased', 'whole', 'season', 'was', 'glued', 'screen', 'watching', 'whole', 'thing', 'marathon', 'night.Much', 'surprise', 'was', 'extremely', 'pleasant', 'entertaining', 'watch', ""'m"", 'strongly', 'looking', 'forward', 'second', 'season.They', 'do', 'take', 'colossal', 'amount', 'liberties', 'historical', 'fact', 'can', 'understand', 'approve', 'sake', 'tv-series-format', 'storytelling', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'everything', 'accurate', 'would', 'blow', 'budget', 'leave', '300', 'episode', 'series', 'sadly', 'changes', 'just', 'make', 'sense', 'whatsoever.But', 'most', 'part', 'changes', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'unpleasant', 'decrease', 'enjoyment', 'series', 'most', 'important', 'elements', 'character', 'being', 'present', 'there', 'most', 'part', 'not', 'far', 'historical', 'Borgia', 'especially', 'considering', 'liberties', 'film-makers', 'have', 'always', 'traditionally', 'taken', 'anything', 'Borgia-related', 'family', 'extreme', 'potential', 'dramatic', 'film-making', ""n't"", 'help', 'result', 'sticklers', 'accuracy', 'rarely', 'find', 'something', 'truly', 'right', 'Normally', ""'m"", 'constantly', 'frowning', 'going', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'happen', 'way', 'whole', 'period', 'piece', 'movie', 'episode', 'generally', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'However', 'series', 'proved', 'be', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'be', 'entertained', 'would', 'ignore', 'inaccuracies.I', 'would', 'say', 'can', 'overlook', 'liberties', 'taken', 'storytelling', 'etc.', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'TV', 'series', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'must-watch', 'Borgia', 'fans', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Amazon', 'option', 'actually', 'purchase', 'video-on-demand', 'instead', 'just', 'renting', 'will', 'definitely', 'be', 'rewatching', 'it.Also', 'costumes', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'even', 'not', 'always', 'accurate', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Cesare', 'Lucrezia', 'others', 'are', 'quite', 'impressive', 'eye-candy', 'always', 'bonus', 'as', 'well']",N/A

And Alexander's son, the cute gay actor from Canada is given a much too poofy hair style. So I want to use the genius first season merely for comment on Fr. Mitch Pacwa from my other review:""The Da Vinci HoaxDVD ~ SJ Fr. Mitch PacwaOffered by Mercury Media PartnersPrice: $6.98Availability: In Stock40 used & new from $0.010 of 2 people found the following review helpfulFr Mitch Pacwa's ""Truth"" Is Full of Unacknowledged Fiction, February 28, 2012This review is from: The Da Vinci Hoax (DVD)Since as far as I know the author of the Da Vinci Code never claimed that his popular book was anything other than fiction, it is hard to know how to even review a book which claims it is a hoax. This is the sort of misprision that appeals to people who can't distinguish between truth and fiction in the first place. So to review this book is pointless. But one can assess the truthfulness of one of the authors, the voice of droning ""orthodoxy"" on catholic cable, Fr. Mitch Pacwa. Now Fr. Mitch, as he encourages people to call him, has a show where he takes calls. Today while eating a turkey sandwich and tortilla chips, I happened to hear him answer a question, that made me realize God had really smiled on me today. I have been waiting to find one, clear incident in the prattle of apologists like Pacwa where they don't protect everything in advance with wiggle words, and historical half-truths. Well, alleluia, this questioner got Fr. Mitch to finally cough one up! To wit, the questioner said that there was some question in mind because if very bad Popes had defined dogmas, how could we trust what later came to be called Papal Infallibility. Good question. At least of the extremis positions of reactionary Catholics, not liberal ones. Well, Fr. Mitch got into a little snit and said with a huff that this is how dishonest critics of the Church work. He said that in fact ""none of the bad Popes had ever defined a dogma"". He said no one could find even one instance, and that if they could then he would listen....but they won't.Well, Pacwa clearly is just one more Catholic guy trying to pretend history does not exist. And worse trying to convince others they he and his type have ""got it covered"" , that they have looked into all these things, and so the laity can just relax. Not only is it a lie, but it is even a bad lie. Because if you have any sense at all what you are looking for, you can find the contradiction for Pacwa's silly and condescending bluster almost immediately. For, in fact, the most famous ""bad Pope"" of all time, Alexander VI, was crucially involved with defining the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. This dogma of the RC church had been more vaguely adumbrated at the Council of Trent. But it was Alexander VI who defined it as far as any Pope could define things institutionally in those days. The later 19th Century apotheosis of the dogma in the form of a new use of the notion of ""infallibility"" doe not take one smidgen away from the fact that the Pope who first defined it clearly was Alexander VI. (nor the fact that it was used as an Anglican trope of critique.) What matters is that it is true and historical. And it calls into question the laughable pose of didactic surety this man assumes in many hoary judgments. So Pacwa's ultimatums are about on the level of fiction it seems. And not as entertaining as the Da Vinci Code.""""",5,Fr.

1424815,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B004QOB8O8,PJR,"[10, 11]","A difficult challenge well met. Congratulations. The history of the Roman Church is central to the history of Europe for several hundred years. Yet we little in the arts to help us to visualize the inner workings of the Curia and the Papacy and its role in shaping the destiny of Italy, Europe, and indeed the world. I love history and have always felt that it is tragic that the general public has not had glimpses of some of the most fascinating aspects of history. Admittedly this sort of thing is complicated and involves politics phrased in terms of religion, and the real world politics was complicated by the fact that the political units were so fragmented compared to what is now familiar.In the Borgias the personal misdeeds and family dynamics make a good ""hook"" for dramatic purposes. I think they did a good job showing that the times themselves were bloody and that the Borgias were not all that out of step with the political realities of a time when wealth was growing in Europe along with ambitions and military technology. We can hardly judge according to to our wishful thinking today about how the world ought to be. In that sense I imagine that educated Catholics will feel that the Church gets a fair break in this  interpretation. The Borgias were sharks but swimming in shark infested waters to say the least.It is simply fact that the popes played divide and conquer -- or one might say, divide and prevail -- and was an obstacle to political unification. This comes across in the ways in which Alexander plays off Milan against Florence and Naples, etc. and we can easily imagine other play offs with Spain, France, Portugal, etc.  They also do a decent job in getting in the idea of how he uses the prestige of the papacy to win political allies and manipulate the great game of politics in Europe.The use of children and especially women as political pawns is well known of course but here the deliberations are drawn out so that the human side is brought nicely into focus. This was clear in The Tudors too but kings are supposed to have children and Popes are not.  So here there is the added dimension that having children to marry off was actually an asset for an ambitious Pope back then and not ONLY a sign of decadence. The series does a decent job of showing how marriage even of illegitimate children could be politically advantageous in the case of powerful clergy.All in all, I think they did a good job of presenting a lot of complicated and controversial material. Was it perfect? Of course not. None of these sorts of series can be. Were the costumes up to the glittering quality of those in the Tudors? No and if you watch it for the costumes you will be disappointed. How about Irons acting? I thought it was subdued at first, but picked up nicely. On reflection probably he should have started out more seemingly humble or calm  when he was new to the papacy.  Then he never became the stereotype of a villain and that seems right to me. It would have looked silly. It is easier for a King of England to look sinister than a Pope.We should have more historical soap operas or dramas or whatever you want to call them about Church history. Gregory VII would be wonderful for example, even Leo IX who earlier failed to establish the papal monarchy that Gregory finally did work out. Then there were the great Church and State struggles and the Avignon captivity and the struggles to return to Rome and so on even into the conflicts with Napoleon. Will we ever see these? Maybe not. But I hope that The Borgias could be a first step by showing that this sort of material can be good entertainment. I well appreciate, of course that Borgia blood and sex were largely what would bring a larger audience into watching stories in this sort of setting.",5,Terrific!,1316476800,"09 20, 2011",2011,3789,"['difficult', 'challenge', 'well', 'met', 'Congratulations', 'history', 'Roman', 'Church', 'central', 'history', 'Europe', 'several', 'hundred', 'years', 'little', 'arts', 'help', 'visualize', 'inner', 'workings', 'Curia', 'Papacy', 'role', 'shaping', 'destiny', 'Italy', 'Europe', 'indeed', 'world', 'love', 'history', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'tragic', 'general', 'public', 'not', 'had', 'glimpses', 'most', 'fascinating', 'aspects', 'history', 'Admittedly', 'sort', 'thing', 'complicated', 'politics', 'phrased', 'terms', 'religion', 'real', 'world', 'politics', 'was', 'complicated', 'fact', 'political', 'units', 'were', 'so', 'fragmented', 'compared', 'what', 'now', 'familiar.In', 'Borgias', 'personal', 'misdeeds', 'family', 'dynamics', 'make', 'good', 'hook', 'dramatic', 'purposes', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'times', 'were', 'bloody', 'Borgias', 'were', 'not', 'step', 'political', 'realities', 'time', 'when', 'wealth', 'was', 'growing', 'Europe', 'ambitions', 'military', 'technology', 'can', 'hardly', 'judge', 'according', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'today', 'how', 'world', 'ought', 'be', 'sense', 'imagine', 'educated', 'Catholics', 'will', 'feel', 'Church', 'fair', 'break', 'interpretation', 'Borgias', 'were', 'sharks', 'swimming', 'shark', 'infested', 'waters', 'say', 'least.It', 'simply', 'fact', 'popes', 'played', 'divide', 'conquer', 'one', 'might', 'say', 'divide', 'prevail', 'was', 'obstacle', 'political', 'unification', 'ways', 'Alexander', 'Milan', 'Florence', 'Naples', 'etc', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'other', 'play', 'offs', 'Spain', 'France', 'Portugal', 'etc', 'also', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'getting', 'idea', 'how', 'prestige', 'papacy', 'win', 'political', 'allies', 'manipulate', 'great', 'game', 'politics', 'Europe.The', 'use', 'children', 'especially', 'women', 'political', 'pawns', 'well', 'known', 'course', 'here', 'deliberations', 'are', 'drawn', 'out', 'so', 'human', 'side', 'brought', 'nicely', 'focus', 'was', 'clear', 'Tudors', 'too', 'kings', 'are', 'supposed', 'have', 'children', 'Popes', 'are', 'not', 'So', 'here', 'added', 'dimension', 'having', 'children', 'marry', 'off', 'was', 'actually', 'asset', 'ambitious', 'Pope', 'back', 'then', 'not', 'ONLY', 'sign', 'decadence', 'series', 'decent', 'job', 'showing', 'how', 'marriage', 'even', 'illegitimate', 'children', 'could', 'be', 'politically', 'advantageous', 'case', 'powerful', 'clergy.All', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'presenting', 'lot', 'complicated', 'controversial', 'material', 'Was', 'perfect', 'course', 'not', 'None', 'sorts', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'Were', 'costumes', 'up', 'glittering', 'quality', 'Tudors', 'watch', 'costumes', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'How', 'Irons', 'acting', 'thought', 'was', 'subdued', 'first', 'picked', 'up', 'nicely', 'reflection', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'started', 'out', 'more', 'seemingly', 'humble', 'calm', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'papacy', 'Then', 'never', 'became', 'stereotype', 'villain', 'right', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'silly', 'easier', 'King', 'England', 'look', 'sinister', 'Pope.We', 'should', 'have', 'more', 'historical', 'soap', 'operas', 'dramas', 'want', 'call', 'Church', 'history', 'Gregory', 'VII', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'example', 'even', 'Leo', 'IX', 'who', 'earlier', 'failed', 'establish', 'papal', 'monarchy', 'Gregory', 'finally', 'did', 'work', 'out', 'Then', 'were', 'great', 'Church', 'State', 'struggles', 'Avignon', 'captivity', 'struggles', 'return', 'Rome', 'so', 'even', 'conflicts', 'Napoleon', 'Will', 'ever', 'see', 'Maybe', 'not', 'hope', 'Borgias', 'could', 'be', 'first', 'step', 'showing', 'sort', 'material', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'entertainment', 'well', 'appreciate', 'course', 'Borgia', 'blood', 'sex', 'were', 'largely', 'what', 'would', 'bring', 'larger', 'audience', 'watching', 'stories', 'sort', 'setting']",N/A
1424816,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B004QOB8O8,"Ray ""A Reader""","[1, 1]","The Borgias is a Showtime drama set in late 15th century Rome. The specific focus of the show concerns Rodrigo Borgias' ascent to the papacy and his efforts to stay in power through the turbulent events of the period.The show commences in 1492, the year that Alexander VI became Pope. Of course, most people will also recognize that year as the same in which Columbus discovered the New World. This date therefore provides an easy connection to the historical timeline that most people can easily relate to. Once Borgia becomes Alexander VI, the saga begins, and the show describes the machinations made to maintain Alexander six on the throne. This is a difficult and sometimes brutal history, and those that are familiar with this history will not be surprised at the events that unfold in the subsequent episodes. The show is largely historically accurate, both in the broad brush strokes and also in some of the minute details.There is little reason to repeat the expensive information that has already been written about this series including the specific detail covered in each episode. We can easily echo, however, the extremely high-quality production values of the show. We can also echo the view that the acting in the show is extremely well done. As companies like Showtime and HBO and Netflix continue to make extremely lush, well-developed dramas, we see that this move has now become the pinnacle of television production at this current time, one that is now rivaling, and sometimes, surpassing full screen movies. This is also the case with The Borgias. This is a show that is supremely well done, and it shows in every scene. The art sets, the costumes, the colors, the settings, and on and on are superbly well done. In fact, it seems we are watching here something of a quality level that would not even normally be seen in a full screen movie.The acting, of course, is of greatest importance, and we see with an outstanding cast including Jeremy Irons that the cast are up to every bit of the task and make the story come alive on the screen. It has been rumored that the show cost Showtime approximately $2.5 million per episode to make. That runs out to roughly $25 million per season. When you watch the show on a high definition television BluRay player, you can see where some of that money was spent. The show is lush, lavish, and it makes one marvel at how such shows are being made  today. Filming was carried out primarily in Hungary, and there is some use of CGI and certain scenes, but these are barely noticeable, and in fact sometimes are not noticeable at all. The architectural backgrounds to many of the scenes are simply superb, even when they are CGI.The Borgias had a loyal following for the first three seasons on Showtime. However, in a trend that we have heard all too often before, ratings were not as high as Showtime had hoped, particularly in Season Three. The show was originally slated for a four season run, but because the ratings were slightly disappointing in Season Three, Showtime decided to cancel the series at the end of the third season. This means that the planned Season Four of The Borgias does not exist, and likely will never be made. (This is not unlike the situation that occurred with the critically acclaimed show Boss, starring Kelsey Grammer, which was canceled after two seasons because of low ratings, but was considered to be one of the best drama shows put on television in recent memory.) But in spite of the disappointment that no Season Four is to be made, this is no reason not to watch The Borgias and to follow those first three seasons as they are made. (The same is true of Boss, as well; watching its first two seasons can be an amazing experience, in spite of the truncated ending of the show.)The Borgias is an excellent historical drama that will help you to learn much about the period, and the papacy of Alexander the sixth.

I just about fell out of my chair. This would be comparable to an elaborate production surrounding the Innaugural Ball of George Washington with Hootie and the Blowfish providing the musical soundtrack. I can't imagine how this blatant error got beyond the cutting room.If you are going to do historical drama, you need someone on staff who knows history. All the rest of the movie is accompanied by period Italian Renaissance music, but not the coronation of the Pope. You can't just use a piece of music because it is impressive; it needs to be from the appropriate time period.I, like many other commentators, also found a number of inconsistancies and contradictions like women wandering around unescorted and taking far more liberties than were taken in the 15th and 16th centuries.Also I found it odd that French characters spoke English, appropriately with French accents, and Spanish characters spoke English with Spanish accents, while all of the Italian characters sounded like they all graduated from Oxford.I also found it odd that the Pope would not allow the mother of the bride (his ex-mistress) to attend their daughter, Lucretia's wedding for fear of scandal, yet sat there blatantly at the wedding feast with his mistress sitting beside him stroking his hair. In fact, I wonder why the Pope, who explained to his ex-mistress and mother of his children,that she couldn't live with him now that he was Pope because it wouldn't look right, and yet has a younger mistress that everyone knows about living with him at all times and attending public events with him?",4,The Great Anachronism,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,2176,"['many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'did', 'enjoy', 'series', 'sheer', 'art', 'beauty', 'costuming', 'music', 'entertainment', 'qualities', 'must', 'admit', 'am', 'amazed', 'would', 'spend', 'amount', 'money', 'expensive', 'sets', 'elaborate', 'costuming', 'done', 'perfection', 'down', 'detail', 'then', 'make', 'blatant', 'error', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'easily', 'corrected.I', 'speak', 'here', 'playing', 'coronation', 'Zadok', 'Priest', 'was', 'written', 'G', 'F', 'Handel', '1727', 'coronation', 'George', 'II', 'time', 'coronation', 'Pope', 'Alexander', 'VI', '1492', '200', 'years', 'was', 'written', 'just', 'about', 'fell', 'chair', 'would', 'be', 'comparable', 'elaborate', 'production', 'surrounding', 'Innaugural', 'Ball', 'George', 'Washington', 'Hootie', 'Blowfish', 'providing', 'musical', 'soundtrack', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'how', 'blatant', 'error', 'got', 'cutting', 'room.If', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'historical', 'drama', 'need', 'someone', 'staff', 'who', 'history', 'rest', 'movie', 'accompanied', 'period', 'Italian', 'Renaissance', 'music', 'not', 'coronation', 'Pope', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'use', 'piece', 'music', 'impressive', 'be', 'appropriate', 'time', 'period.I', 'many', 'other', 'commentators', 'also', 'found', 'number', 'inconsistancies', 'contradictions', 'women', 'wandering', 'around', 'unescorted', 'taking', 'far', 'more', 'liberties', 'were', 'taken', '15th', '16th', 'centuries.Also', 'found', 'French', 'characters', 'spoke', 'English', 'appropriately', 'French', 'accents', 'Spanish', 'characters', 'spoke', 'English', 'Spanish', 'accents', 'Italian', 'characters', 'sounded', 'graduated', 'Oxford.I', 'also', 'found', 'Pope', 'would', 'not', 'allow', 'mother', 'bride', 'ex-mistress', 'attend', 'daughter', 'Lucretia', 'wedding', 'fear', 'scandal', 'yet', 'sat', 'blatantly', 'wedding', 'feast', 'mistress', 'sitting', 'stroking', 'hair', 'fact', 'wonder', 'why', 'Pope', 'who', 'explained', 'ex-mistress', 'mother', 'children', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'now', 'was', 'Pope', 'would', ""n't"", 'look', 'right', 'yet', 'younger', 'mistress', 'everyone', 'living', 'times', 'attending', 'public', 'events']",N/A

1424831,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B004QOB8O8,Theo,"[99, 109]","There is a great deal to admire in this series. Visually it is superb. The costuming and sets manage simultaneously to be both beautiful and realistic to the period; or at least, they seem so to my untutored eye. The actors uniformly do an extraordinarily good job. So much so that it is difficult to know whom to focus upon in this review, because whatever choices I make I will be omitting mention of some truly outstanding performances.However, I am going to begin in the obvious place: with Jeremy Irons' interpretation of Rodrigo Borgia. I do so if only because so much hinges on this pivotal character. The Telegraph critic Rachel Ray criticised this series on the grounds that it ""lacks the amoral aura of a psychopathic family"", and specifically criticised Irons' own performance as ""disappointingly undiabolical"". On a strictly literal level Ray's perception of this series is entirely accurate. However, I would argue that it also entirely misses the point.The Rodrigo Borgia we find in this show was never intended as an inhuman monster who would not have been out of place cackling maniacally atopSnake Mountain. Rather, what we gaze upon here is far closer to the true face of evil as it most often exists in the real world: ordinary, resigned in the face of the dictates of Realpolitik, and when confronted with the moral reality of where such dictates lead, by turns a true believer, actively self deluding, and at times even self doubting. Not unlike a concentration camp guard who can go home at night and be a loving father to his children. I am very much reminded here of political theorist Hannah Arendt's famous phrase ""the banality of evil"". It would be doing a great disservice both to Irons' individual performance and to the moral complexities of this series more generally to suggest that everything could be summed up entirely in such straightforward terms. Nevertheless, we would at least have the comfort of being considerably closer to the human reality of what ""The Borgias"" sets out to achieve than whatever it is Ray was expecting - apparently some kind of costumed remake of The Godfather.Rodrigo Borgia aside, there are many more truly outstanding performances in this series than I can realistically go into here. It is worth saying that Franois Arnaud, Holliday Grainger, and David Oaks all do outstanding jobs in their respective rolls as Rodrigo Borgia's adult children. Sean Harris, although in a relatively minor role as Cesare Borgia's assasin, is also very much worthy of mention. While his performance is extremely minimalist, he somehow manages to achieve a great deal while apparently doing very little. I find myself genuinely left wondering what goes on behind those eyes. It must take an enormous amount of skill to suggest so much with so little.Unusually for a ""quality drama"", if this series has a weakness it is in the writing. Don't get me wrong: the writing is good. It's just that it never manages to be more than ""good"". It doesn't achieve the same standard as the other aspects of the production. If I could sum up my reservations about the writing in a single sentence it would be simply this: it does not surprise me. I say that from the perspective of someone with a very slight nodding acquaintance with the history of the period, although no more than that. But to be clear, when I talk of not being surprised, I'm not just talking about the specific events that take place. It's more that there is a decided absence of moments where I find myself thinking ""Gee they did that well""! In fact, there are no such moments at all until relatively late in the piece when the French King (once again played impeccably, in this case by Michael Muller) arrives on the stage. And even then, the surprises - those ""wow"" moments - are few and far between, and as a rule are rather mild.Still... it's not like the writing is bad or anything. It's good. Solid... If perhaps just a tiny bit predictable. Actually, this series is at its most unsettling when it communicates with us on a purely sensual level with sound and vision, cannons blazing. In this case literally so.And speaking of the French, one curiosity of this series is that despite being an international production with an international cast, all of the Italian characters not only speak English, they are made to do so with very pronounced English accents. Of course, when the French get involved, they too all speak exclusively in English - although in their case they speak English with French accents! It's little touches like this that remind us that despite its superficial mundane realism, television is ultimately about communicating ideas, and finally a story, to an audience. I suppose I just find it interesting how readily, perhaps even unthinkingly, we as an audience accept such methods of communication.That particular curiosity and my reservations about the writing aside, this is still absolutely something I'd recommend seeing. And I am most definitely waiting with baited breath for season two!Theo.",4,Great Acting & Cinematography; Solid Writing,1315008000,"09 3, 2011",2011,5031,"['great', 'deal', 'admire', 'series',

And this series has that excess to excess.It is a real shame, based upon the history of the Borgias, that the screenwriters could not fit the script to the historical facts.  Instead, there is endless chit-chat (especially between the Pope & his mistress) that leads no where, and does not push the plot down the road.  The Borgias lived in exciting times, none of which is maximized in this script.  And the terrible casting: Check Savanarola (Steven Berkoff).  He is fat!  And no hooked nose!  He looks more like Martin Luther or Friar Tuck.The best that can be said of the script is the interplay between Cesare (Francois Arnaud) and his sister Lucrezia (Holliday Grainger).  Not only do they both look like their historical characters, but the love they have for each other is superbly filmed, not with words, but the way they look at each other and hold each other.
