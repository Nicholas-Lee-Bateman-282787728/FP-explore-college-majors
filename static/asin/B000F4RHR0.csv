983130,AKPW2IRLY7CMY,B000F4RHR0,Bob Bennett,"[0, 0]",Watched this movie as a Jenna fan.  Interesting story - a strong mixture of sadness and growing love between two people.  What I found amazing was the number of scenes with minimal dialog that none the less conveyed an element of the plot.  Also amazing was how Angela (Jenna) was not a basket case with all that she was dealing with.  Makes a good case for keeping the faith - there is always hope.,4,Good movie but very unusual,1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,399,"['Watched', 'movie', 'Jenna', 'fan', 'Interesting', 'story', 'strong', 'mixture', 'sadness', 'growing', 'love', 'two', 'people', 'What', 'found', 'amazing', 'was', 'number', 'scenes', 'minimal', 'dialog', 'less', 'conveyed', 'element', 'plot', 'Also', 'amazing', 'was', 'how', 'Angela', 'Jenna', 'was', 'not', 'basket', 'case', 'was', 'dealing', 'Makes', 'good', 'case', 'keeping', 'faith', 'always', 'hope']",Touched
983131,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000F4RHR0,Brian E. Erland,"[18, 19]","Okay, I admit it, 'Touched' released in '05 plays like a Hallmark classic even though it isn't. It is unquestionably a chick flick so be forwarned. Just remember, fair is fair, guys have to give in once in a while and watch something our wives or girlfriends want to see. Fortunately it does star the very attractive Jenna Elfman and I can't think of any male who doesn't like her.Plot: Recently separated Father and son are hit by an oncoming car. The son dies and the Father (Randall Batinkoff) falls into a coma for the next two years. Nurse Angela Martin (Jenna Elfman) takes care of him during that time until he unexpectedly awakens. OK, we all know the basic storyline from here on, don't we?Anyway good production values, attractive cast and just a good film all around. Make your wife or girlfriend happy and give it a shot, the women will absolutely adore Randall Batinkoff and the rest of us can appreciate Jenna. So be tough, suck it up and be a man.

The whole waking-up-from-a-coma topic is improbable at best, but it's also of a theme that all of us hope and dream for, and presented quite effectively by a very attractive cast.  Nice chemistry between Elfman and Batinkoff, too.My boyfriend was in a horrendous accident and in a coma for 3 days before awakening, not nearly so dramatically as portrayed in this movie, but just as emotionally, so I have a certain affinity for what these characters go through.It's a lovely and well meaning little movie with flawed and imperfect characters and a message of love and hope.",4,Very sweet....,1157328000,"09 4, 2006",2006,623,"['Sure', 'Hollywood-ness', 'movie', 'whole', 'waking-up-from-a-coma', 'topic', 'improbable', 'best', 'also', 'theme', 'hope', 'dream', 'presented', 'quite', 'effectively', 'very', 'attractive', 'cast', 'Nice', 'chemistry', 'Elfman', 'Batinkoff', 'too.My', 'boyfriend', 'was', 'horrendous', 'accident', 'coma', '3', 'days', 'awakening', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'dramatically', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'just', 'emotionally', 'have', 'certain', 'affinity', 'what', 'characters', 'go', 'through.It', 'lovely', 'well', 'meaning', 'little', 'movie', 'flawed', 'imperfect', 'characters', 'message', 'love', 'hope']",Touched
