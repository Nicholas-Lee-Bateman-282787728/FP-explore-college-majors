The film is amazing with a red-hot iron cast! and above all, performances and on screen chemistry, Binoche was beyond words. She is a perfect example of potryal of purity and sensuality in a woman. After 'Chocolat' this is the second film of Binoche worth admiring. Auteuil and Kustrurica were terrefic. The chemistry between each charecter is wonderfull and strong. Its a beautifull film, worth watching for Binoche's strong performence.

His wife (Juliette Binoche) believes in the inherent goodness of people, and the prisoner becomes her ""project"", her protege, at first assisting in building a greenhouse with her.  The Captain, quick tempered, mercurial, nevertheless adores his wife, and indulges her whims to the point that the prisoner is virtually set free to work in the villages and becomes devoted to the Captain's wife, much to the consternation of the petty bureaucrats who run the town.The prisoner killed while drunk, and under the Captain's wife's influence, now sober, he is transformed and is revealed to be a basically good person.  In fact he performs an act of heroism and the people of Saint-Pierre no longer wish his execution.  However, the town Leaders have sent for a guillotine, and one is onboard a vessel, making its inexorable way to Saint-Pierre and an inevitable crisis.Really a study of the 3 people involved: the Captain, his wife & the condemned prisoner, the film is not so much a blanket argument against capital punishment as it is a look at the difficulty of finding true justice within the laws of men.  Human passions cloud the issues, as do jealousy, envy,  the exertion of authority for its own sake, and the denial of the possibility for redemption.Beautifully filmed (I have to quit writing that, cinematography is so universally excellent anymore, it is a surprise if something ISN'T beautifully photographed) in the icy winters of Quebec, we watch the drama unfold, knowing that this is not going to end well.Binoche is beautiful, her smiles of joy at her protege's transformation light the screen.  Auteuil's Captain is enigmatic & prickly.  There are hints that he has caused himself problems previously, which is why he is in such an isolated & Godforsaken posting.  His wife believes in goodness, and he believes in the goodness of his wife.  He loves her utterly.  It is the irony of the story, that her good intentions and good actions, bringing about a real transformation in a once thuggish man, will result in tragecy for them all.

666859,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00005N89H,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 2]","[Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.]BEWARE OF SPOILERS!In this French language film (with English subtitles), Juliette Binoche plays what some today might call a ""bleeding heart liberal,"" maybe even a head-strong bleeding heart liberal.  Her name is Pauline and her husband Jean (Daniel Auteuil) is the Captain of a troop of soldiers on the island of St. Pierre off the coast of Newfoundland.  The year is 1849.One night two of the local peasants get drunk and have an argument about whether a certain man of the island is fat or just big.  As a joke they go to his cottage and rouse him from his dinner table with calls of ""fat!"" and ""big"" until he comes out to investigate with a knife in his hands for protection.  In the ensuing confrontation one of the men holds the big guy from behind while the other (Ariel Neel Auguste, played by Emir Kusturica) knocks the knife from his hand, picks it up, and in a kind of madness cuts the man open to see--as they later testify at the trial--whether he is really fat or just big.As it happens, Neel is condemned to death, but can't be executed because the law requires that he be beheaded and there is no guillotine on the island, nor is there an executioner.  Since he can hardly run away from this snowy island, Pauline wants him out of his cell and at work helping her around the house, maybe as a gardener.  Jean, who loves Pauline extravagantly, agrees and Neel becomes Pauline's prot&eacute;g&eacute;.  She wants to reform him and teach him to read, etc.  The tension in the film builds as her good intensions run afoul of the island's governing authorities.  Through it all Jean stands steadfast by his wife in a most heroic way.I won't say anymore about the plot.  What interests me more is the motivation of Pauline in helping Neel.  Is she motivated by generosity of heart or by her desire to be a person doing good?  This is an ancient question.  Do we do good because that is our nature or because we are fulfilling a desire to be good?  Furthermore, is Pauline's heart filled with human love for Neel or does she in fact have a yen for him?Director Patrice Leconte gives us plenty of reason to be skeptical.  When Pauline is sitting practically on Neel's lap while teaching him to read, the camera closes in on their fingers as they trace the lines in the text.  The fingers get closer and closer together until they touch and even mingle a bit.Cut immediately to a scene through a bedroom door: two naked figures in vigorous sexual union.  At first we can't see who they are, and it is hard not to imagine that it is Pauline and Neel in adulterous embrace.  However, it is Pauline and her husband, Jean.In another scene the bored women of the island are seen talking about how close Pauline and Neel have gotten and how this must inspire Jean to be a better lover; but in fact we can see that what the presence of Neel is doing is lighting a fire under Pauline.Captain Jean is an entirely admirable character who loves his wife.  Neel is also admirable in that he loves Pauline but doesn't make any moves on her.  He becomes something of a hero when he saves the building of a caf&eacute; on wheels being moved from crashing.  She is of course the most talked-about person on the island, the source of most of the gossip.  As we watch the film unfold there is a sense of doom coming.  We know something terrible is going to happen; we just don't know what or to whom.In the final analysis I guess we can say that Pauline--who, in the framing device, narrates the events from memory--got not what she deserved--for no one deserves what happened to her; nor can we attribute what happens to some kind of fatalism.  Instead the tragedy can be seen as the direct result of her compromised behavior.  Or perhaps we can make a more generous interpretation and say that no good deed ever goes unpunished.This film can also be seen as a tract against capital punishment since Neel is basically a good man who made a bad mistake.  He is clearly a worthwhile member of the community.  He is also repentant even to the point of believing that he must pay for his sin in accordance with the law.See this for director Patrice Laconte who has a nice touch with historical period pieces and directs with the kind of attention to detail and story that rank him among the very best auteurs of the French cinema.  I also highly recommend his Ridicule (1996) and La fille sur la pont (1999).",5,A moral tale,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,4548,"['[', 'Note', '500', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'book', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote', 'Get', 'Amazon', ']', 'BEWARE', 'OF', 'SPOILERS', 'French', 'language', 'film', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'what', 'today', 'might', 'call', 'bleeding', 'heart', 'liberal', 'maybe', 'even', 'head-strong', 'bleeding', 'heart', 'liberal', 'name', 'Pauline', 'husband', 'Jean', 'Daniel', 'Auteuil', 'Captain', 'troop', 'soldiers', 'island', 'St.', 'Pierre', 'coast', 'Newfoundland', 'year', '1849.One', 'night', 'two', 'local', 'peasants', 'get', 'drunk', 'have', 'argument', 'certain', 'man', 'island', 'fat', 'just', 'big', 'joke', 'go', 'cottage', 'rouse', 'dinner', 'table', 'calls', 'fat', 'big', 'out', 'investigate', 'knife', 'hands', 'protection', 'ensuing', 'confrontation', 'one', 'men', 'big', 'guy', 'other', 'Ariel', 'Neel', 'Auguste', 'played', 'Emir', 'Kusturica', 'knife', 'hand', 'up', 'kind', 'madness', 'cuts', 'man', 'open', 'see', 'later', 'testify', 'trial', 'really', 'fat', 'just', 'big.As', 'Neel', 'condemned', 'death', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'executed', 'law', 'be', 'beheaded', 'guillotine', 'island', 'executioner', 'can', 'hardly', 'run', 'away', 'snowy', 'island', 'Pauline', 'cell', 'work', 'helping', 'house', 'maybe', 'gardener', 'Jean', 'who', 'Pauline', 'extravagantly', 'agrees', 'Neel', 'Pauline', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'reform', 'teach', 'read', 'etc', 'tension', 'film', 'good', 'intensions', 'run', 'afoul', 'island', 'governing', 'authorities', 'Jean', 'stands', 'steadfast', 'wife', 'most', 'heroic', 'way.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anymore', 'plot', 'What', 'interests', 'more', 'motivation', 'Pauline', 'helping', 'Neel', 'motivated', 'generosity', 'heart', 'desire', 'be', 'person', 'doing', 'good', 'ancient', 'question', 'Do', 'do', 'good', 'nature', 'are', 'fulfilling', 'desire', 'be', 'good', 'Furthermore', 'Pauline', 'heart', 'filled', 'human', 'love', 'Neel', 'fact', 'have', 'yen', 'Director', 'Patrice', 'Leconte', 'plenty', 'reason', 'be', 'skeptical', 'When', 'Pauline', 'sitting', 'practically', 'Neel', 'lap', 'teaching', 'read', 'camera', 'fingers', 'trace', 'lines', 'text', 'fingers', 'get', 'closer', 'closer', 'together', 'touch', 'even', 'mingle', 'bit.Cut', 'immediately', 'scene', 'bedroom', 'door', 'two', 'naked', 'figures', 'vigorous', 'sexual', 'union', 'first', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'who', 'are', 'hard', 'not', 'imagine', 'Pauline', 'Neel', 'adulterous', 'embrace', 'However', 'Pauline', 'husband', 'Jean.In', 'scene', 'bored', 'women', 'island', 'are', 'seen', 'talking', 'how', 'close', 'Pauline', 'Neel', 'have', 'gotten', 'how', 'must', 'inspire', 'Jean', 'be', 'better', 'lover', 'fact', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'presence', 'Neel', 'doing', 'lighting', 'fire', 'Pauline.Captain', 'Jean', 'entirely', 'admirable', 'character', 'who', 'wife', 'Neel', 'also', 'admirable', 'Pauline', ""n't"", 'make', 'moves', 'something', 'hero', 'when', 'building', 'caf', 'eacute', 'wheels', 'being', 'moved', 'crashing', 'course', 'most', 'talked-about', 'person', 'island', 'source', 'most', 'gossip', 'watch', 'film', 'unfold', 'sense', 'doom', 'coming', 'know', 'something', 'terrible', 'going', 'happen', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'whom.In', 'final', 'analysis', 'guess', 'can', 'say', 'Pauline', 'who', 'framing', 'device', 'events', 'memory', 'got', 'not', 'what', 'deserved', 'one', 'what', 'happened', 'can', 'attribute', 'what', 'kind', 'fatalism', 'Instead', 'tragedy', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'direct', 'result', 'compromised', 'behavior', 'perhaps', 'can', 'make', 'more', 'generous', 'interpretation', 'say', 'good', 'deed', 'ever', 'unpunished.This', 'film', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'seen', 'tract', 'capital', 'punishment', 'Neel', 'basically', 'good', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'bad', 'mistake', 'clearly', 'worthwhile', 'member', 'community', 'also', 'repentant', 'even', 'point', 'believing', 'must', 'pay', 'sin', 'accordance', 'law.See', 'director', 'Patrice', 'Laconte', 'who', 'nice', 'touch', 'historical', 'period', 'pieces', 'directs', 'kind', 'attention', 'detail', 'story', 'rank', 'very', 'best', 'auteurs', 'French', 'cinema', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Ridicule', '1996', 'La', 'fille', 'sur', 'la', 'pont', '1999']",N/A
666860,A280GY5UVUS2QH,B00005N89H,Doug Anderson,"[8, 11]","I think this ranks as one of the all-time great studies of romanticism. I would place it alongside Truffaut's Story of Adele H. & Scolas Passione D'Amore as yet another masterfull study of the romantic attitude. The setting of this drama is the remote island of Saint-Pierre which is under French rule and the time is in the months before the French Revolution. In short this film is about the dawning of romanticism.In the first scenes of the film a murder is committed by two drunken sailors. The men are hauled off to the islands prison/garrison to await execution--en route one dies when the wagon transporting the two convicts is pelted by rocks by the islands inhabitants and the horses bolt causing the wagon to topple. The other convict must await the arrival of a guillotene from a nearby island to meet his final moment. It is then we meet the man in charge of the prison/garrison in the person of a wayward Captain played by Daniel Auteil and his equally wayward wife played by Juliette Binoche and the film truly begins.  The prisoner proves to be the perfect conduit through which these two can express their own brand of rebellion. The first to act out of accord with accepted norms is the wife. She can not stand to see the man locked away as he awaits his execution day so she being the wife of the man in charge gets her way when she asks that he be allowed to assist her in her garden. Having accomplished this she begins to openly parade the convict around in plain view of all. This is both an act of pity but also an assertion of her own sense of right for she believes the man though he did a terrible thing to be inherently good and she is vehemently against his being executed. Parading him around in public the villagers get to know him as well and public sentiment is swayed. Eventually no one on the island wants the man to be executed.That is no one but the petty officials who overlook such matters with an ear to current happenings in France herself. The petty officials want to use the prisoner for their own ends. His execution will prove that law and order still prevails in the island provinces if not in France herself. It is these petty officials that the Captain disdains most of all. The Captain arrogantly confronts one after another of them and openly mocks and challenges them. His is a wayward temperament which finds it comes most alive when the enemy is nearest. And for him the enemy is the states beauracracy. He seems to be a man in search of a fight and for him the prisoners fate becomes his personal cause.The stories and fates of the convict, the captains wife and the captain are thus intermingled and the resolution of this three way story is a profound one. Each of the three adhering to their own ideals to the end.Patrice Leconte tells achingly beautiful and original stories(Monsieur Hire, Hairdressers Husband). They are all quite different from anything you've seen and different from each other.

Her sweet smile and deep feelings, resonate on screen as they do in all the films I have watched of hers. Similar, in some ways to the English Patient, but different, falling for another lost soul.

Since her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""The English Patient"" in 1996 and her nomination for ""Chocolat,"" she's an actress whose films I seek.  ""The Widow of Saint-Pierre"" has a bit of irony to the title.  The opening frames show Binoche in black staring out of a window.  We then move into the flashback in which most of the film moves forward.  We learn that the ""widow"" is the guillotine that must be shipped by boat from France before the big execution can take place.  We see director Emir Kusturica in an acting role as the very large prisoner Neel whose rehabilitation Binoche's Madame La seeks.  We keep wondering if the black dress is saved for the prisoner.  Daniel Autereil who won a Cesar (French Oscar) for his work with director Patrice Leconte for ""Ridicule"" in 1996 plays the lovestruck Captain who is in charge of the execution.  Spurred on by his wild and unconditional love for his wife, he thwarts the town's sentence of death at every turn, refusing to allow his soldiers to help haul the widow ship to shore.  In the moment of ultimate irony, Neel volunteers to help bring the widow to shore, which is sure to result in his own execution.  The bloody resolution and the final shots of Binoche in black bring the story to its somber conclusion.  Patrice Leconte has a great reserve, shooting this excellent screenplay in period costume and letting the depth of his cast work its magic.  This is an incredibly tragic romance, one that works exquisitely.

The film starts with a senseless murder and a death sentence for the culprit, played by Emir Kustuica.  However, the execution must be carried out by guillotine, which is referred to as &quot;the widow&quot; and there is no such instrument of death in the town.  It has to be sent by ship from a French Island in the Caribbean.  And this could take as long as a year.The prisoner is under the control of a Captain, played by Daniel Auteuil.  He is deeply in love with his wife, played by Juliette Binoche.  There are some tender scenes of their lovemaking as well as scenes in which it is clear that he adores her and respects her in all ways.  And so, when she sets out to reform the convicted murderer, he supports her wish.  The convicted man is allowed out of his prison cell and accompanies her all over the province.  He helps out the townspeople and works with her to plant a garden and learns to read.  He even impregnates a local woman and marries her.  Everyone in the town grows to admire this man and nobody wants the execution to take place.What will happen?  I was drawn into the story and, along with the townspeople, I too hoped he would eventually get his freedom.  But the story is not as simple as that.  And, as the tension heightened and moved towards its conclusion, I found myself clearly upset as I saw the way it was going.This is a good film.  The story and acting and cinematography are all excellent.  It moved a little too slowly for my taste, however.  And I found it hard to believe that the condemned man would be given so much freedom to move around the town.

Far from being escapist fare, it is a dark, often profound meditation on the human condition and the vagaries of the human heart. In 1849, on the remote French island of Saint-Pierre off the coast of Newfoundland, an illiterate fisherman commits a drunken, senseless murder and is sentenced to the guillotine. But since the island has no guillotine, the governor must send for one--a process that will take years. Meanwhile, the fisherman is imprisoned in the island fortress; the wife of the garrison commander takes pity on the condemned man, and sets out to rehabilitate him, with the help (at first reluctant, later wholehearted) of her loving husband. Soon the captain and his wife are defying the governor in their attempts to help the condemned man--with tragic consequences. &quot;The Widow of Saint-Pierre&quot; works on several levels: as a romantic drama; as a denunciation of capital punishment and the cruelty of confusing the letter of the law with justice; and as a brilliant delineation of the nature of love, courage and self-sacrifice. Eduardo Serra's photography of the wintry landscape of Saint-Pierre (actually Nova Scotia) is marvelous, and the acting deserves the highest praise. By now, of course, everyone knows how exquisite Juliette Binoche is, and she is as good as ever here. But the thespian honors in this movie go to Daniel Auteuil, an actor of masterful subtlety and power, who makes Gerard Depardieu look like a double order of &quot;jambon a' l'os.&quot;",5,"Tragic, multilayered, and sweepingly romantic.",988934400,"05 4, 2001",2001,1626,"['quot', 'Widow', 'Saint-Pierre', 'quot', 'one', 'brooding', 'romantic', 'costume', 'dramas', 'only', 'French', 'seem', 'do', 'well', 'days', 'Far', 'being', 'escapist', 'fare', 'dark', 'often', 'profound', 'meditation', 'human', 'condition', 'vagaries', 'human', 'heart', '1849', 'remote', 'French', 'island', 'Saint-Pierre', 'coast', 'Newfoundland', 'illiterate', 'fisherman', 'drunken', 'senseless', 'murder', 'sentenced', 'guillotine', 'island', 'guillotine', 'governor', 'must', 'send', 'one', 'process', 'will', 'take', 'years', 'Meanwhile', 'fisherman', 'imprisoned', 'island', 'fortress', 'wife', 'garrison', 'commander', 'pity', 'condemned', 'man', 'out', 'rehabilitate', 'help', 'first', 'reluctant', 'later', 'wholehearted', 'loving', 'husband', 'Soon', 'captain', 'wife', 'are', 'defying', 'governor', 'attempts', 'help', 'condemned', 'man', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'quot', 'Widow', 'Saint-Pierre', 'quot', 'several', 'levels', 'romantic', 'drama', 'denunciation', 'capital', 'punishment', 'cruelty', 'confusing', 'letter', 'law', 'justice', 'brilliant', 'delineation', 'nature', 'love', 'courage', 'self-sacrifice', 'Eduardo', 'Serra', 'photography', 'wintry', 'landscape', 'Saint-Pierre', 'actually', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'marvelous', 'acting', 'highest', 'praise', 'now', 'course', 'everyone', 'how', 'exquisite', 'Juliette', 'Binoche', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'here', 'thespian', 'honors', 'movie', 'go', 'Daniel', 'Auteuil', 'actor', 'masterful', 'subtlety', 'power', 'who', 'Gerard', 'Depardieu', 'look', 'double', 'order', 'quot', ""l'os."", 'quot']",N/A
666871,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,B00005N89H,Octavius,"[10, 13]","Patrice Leconte's 2001 film on a garrison captain (Auteil) and his wife (Binoche) stationed on the Island of Saint Pierre near Nova Scotia in 1849.  Although the film shines with brilliant direction, cinematography, and acting, it presents its theme through a rather improbable plot.The film is character based and follows the life of a garrison captain (Auteil) and his wife (Binoche) stationed on the Island of Saint Pierre near Nova Scotia in 1849.  The captain and his wife are portrayed as the standards of justice and mercy when a villager (Emir Kustuica) is tried and sentenced to death for killing another in a drunken brawl.  The captain realizes that this man, although guilty of murder, is a good man who just made a fatal mistake.  Feeling that the death penalty is unjust for such a crime, the captain gives the prisoner various liberties outside of his cell.  The condemned man suddenly becomes a model citizen and helps the other villagers with various things while awaiting the ship that carries the guillotine to be used for his execution. The captain and his wife are riddled with guilt and try to plead for the prisoner's release.I found the plot and theme rather contrived.  The film is character driven and the main characters simply don't reflect the prevalent values of French society in 1849. The theme is a parallel of Victor Hugo's 'Les Miserables' in which the prisoner is somewhat of a Jean Valjean and the captain a morally superior Javert.  The reality though is that it would be extremely unlikely for a character such as Auteil's captain to have the morals portrayed in the film: being a military officer in charge of a garrison, he would have to be a man who's prepared to oversee various cases which would involve similar moral doubts as the prisoner's: cases such as desertion, insuboordination, and mutiny, which would all carry the penalty of death.  This is a period of time in France in which even petty thieves were regularly shipped off to prison colonies such as Devil's Island to perform years of hard labor.  It was a period of time in which Victor Hugo was sent into exile by Napoleon III for his outspoken social critiques such as 'Les Miserables.'  In sum, the characters in the film are little more than crude caricatures of the past on whom are imposed purely modern concepts: concepts which were still very foreign for 1849.Despite some of the thematic problems in the film, the direction and cinematography is excellent.

Several found it slow-paced--nothing more than a plodding, costume melodrama. But a hard-to-please film critic like David Thompson called it &#34;a return to form&#34; for Leconte. I don't know the context of that remark, since I've been picky about which Leconte films I've viewed (as well as not having access to some of them). But I watched this with considerable interest & will watch it again. It's not as flashy as some of his other films, such as &#34;The Girl on the Bridge,&#34; but for some viewers that may be a relief. Leconte is interesting in that he seems to be artful & original, but much of the critical reaction to his films is grudging, full of faint praise & skeptical of the many awards he's won. I'm not sure why there's this bias, unless it's precisely because he has been able to walk the line between popular cinema and art-house films--thus pleasing both audiences & critical taste.
