Seidler ""Fog City person""","[3, 4]",This is among my very favorite film in that it portrays Hildegard von Bingen who lived in the first millenium in Germany in a time of great change even for those living in a religious convent.  The lead actress was very strong in her presentation of the forces she fought against in her efforts to protect the young sister nuns under her guidance.

Saint Hildegard is certainly one of them. I am not an expert on her, and I should say I liked this movie to an extent. I know she was a catholic, but this movie is far too limited to the catholic audience. From the little I know about her, I can say with reasonable certainty that she extended catholic teachings. To me, that is the essence of Saint Hildegard, and this movie absolutely fails to capture that. It is really a movie of personal relationships with other nuns and church officials.Perhaps the movie makers did not want to think outside of the box. But I so wished they did so. I would have loved to see a discussion on the impact of her spiritual revelations on the catholic doctrine, in what ways they challenged and in what ways they complemented the existing teachings.The biggest failure of this movie is that they have failed to present her relevance in today's world.

Smartly VISION does not play into the hype, and is comfortable showing a woman who sincerely believes that God speaks through her. It also avoids putting a modern feminist spin on a figure who had no exposure to these concepts. She is simply a woman who learns how to maneuver in a world where men have always had the power. The film moves slowly, and goes through von Bingen's entire life. While it sometimes feels a little too calculated, it is amazing what von Trotta and Sukowa manage to do with the rich material. And the DVD from Zeitgeist is as much of a treat as the film itself. We get panel discussions from both the Telluride Film Festival, as well as the film's premiere at the Goethe Institute in New York; a sit down interview with the director by Gary Giddings; and a booklet that reminds me of something Criterion would put out.""",5,A woman well ahead of her time,1303257600,"04 20, 2011",2011,1034,"['Judge', 'Brett', 'Cullum', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'Hildegard', 'von', 'Bingen', 'someone', 'could', 'play', 'many', 'ways', 'saint', 'mad', 'woman', 'possessed', 'own', 'insanity', 'daft', 'con', 'woman', 'supernatural', 'force', 'Smartly', 'VISION', 'not', 'play', 'hype', 'comfortable', 'showing', 'woman', 'who', 'sincerely', 'God', 'also', 'putting', 'modern', 'feminist', 'spin', 'figure', 'who', 'had', 'exposure', 'concepts', 'simply', 'woman', 'who', 'how', 'maneuver', 'world', 'where', 'men', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'power', 'film', 'slowly', 'von', 'Bingen', 'entire', 'life', 'little', 'too', 'calculated', 'amazing', 'what', 'von', 'Trotta', 'Sukowa', 'manage', 'do', 'rich', 'material', 'DVD', 'Zeitgeist', 'as', 'much', 'treat', 'film', 'get', 'panel', 'discussions', 'Telluride', 'Film', 'Festival', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'premiere', 'Goethe', 'Institute', 'New', 'York', 'sit', 'down', 'interview', 'director', 'Gary', 'Giddings', 'booklet', 'something', 'Criterion', 'would', 'put', 'out']",Vision - From the Life of Hildegard von Bingen

1412150,A31T5ANGT3NCDR,B004KCAYXC,elena maria vidal,"[101, 102]","I had the honor of previewing the extraordinary German-language film ""Vision"", the story of  the great Benedictine nun Hildegard von Bingen. Not since the magnificent 1980's Spanish mini-series ""Teresa de Jesus"" has a film so accurately yet poignantly portrayed a famous woman saint. Newly released on DVD, the Zeitgeist production, directed by Margarethe von Trotta, stars Barbara Sukowa as the enigmatic twelfth century German abbess. One of the most extraordinary figures of the Middle Ages, Hildegard was not only a mystic but an author, a musician, a foundress and a director of souls, learned in the natural sciences as well as in theology and philosophy. She wrote some of the first mystery plays, laying the groundwork for modern drama. Madame Sukowa is able to convey the inner stillness of the contemplative spirit of Hildegard along with her strength and common sense. All the while, the very human side of the saint is always present as she struggles with those who oppose her, as well as with the devil, and with herself.Resisting the temptation to make the film into a piece of feminist propaganda, ""Vision"" portrays Hildegard as an obedient daughter of the Church. Her obedience is by no means mere childish acquiescence, as the vow of obedience is too often misconstrued, but an expression of a vibrant faith. St. Hildegard is not afraid to take a firm but charitable stand against injustice. She will brook no infractions of the Rule which protects the serene and disciplined life of her nuns. She is a true mother ready to fight to the death for her spiritual children.Because of the film's commitment to authenticity there are many elements of medieval life, such as the custom of everyone embracing each other on the lips, which seems odd to modern sensibilities. Hildegard is deposited with the nuns when still a small child as a gift to God from her parents. The cloister becomes the only world she has ever known and the nuns her only family. When a young nun Sister Richardis becomes like the natural daughter she never had, Mother Hildegard objects strongly to Richardis being sent away to become the abbess of another community. At first it appears that the saint has given in to an inordinate attachment but eventually it becomes clear that Hildegard can see that no good will come of the transfer, and she proves to be correct. An exceptionally powerful scene is when Hildegard is summoned to be questioned about her visions by several formidable churchmen. As they glower in anticipation of proving her to be a crazy woman or a demoniac, Hildegard faces them with such calm assurance that there is no doubt as to who will emerge triumphant.Another unique aspect of the film is the rare but real depiction of the vocation of nuns as joyful brides. From the lustrous beauty of the herb gardens to the austerity of the monastic halls, every scene radiates a light and beauty that suggest there is more to living than what the eye can see. Although the viewer is gently and continually reminded of the sacrificial lifestyle of Mother Hildegard and her nuns, a mysterious sense of exultation permeates the film. It becomes clear that while the Benedictines have renounced the world they have been given in return a gift so precious that it is beyond price.(*NOTE: The DVD ""Vision"" was sent to me by the producers in exchange for my honest opinion.)",5,A Joyful Bride of Christ,1303603200,"04 24, 2011",2011,3372,"['had', 'honor', 'previewing', 'extraordinary', 'German-language', 'film', 'Vision', 'story', 'great', 'Benedictine', 'nun', 'Hildegard', 'von', 'Bingen', 'Not', 'magnificent', '1980', 'Spanish', 'mini-series', 'Teresa', 'de', 'Jesus', 'film', 'so', 'accurately', 'yet', 'poignantly', 'portrayed', 'famous', 'woman', 'saint', 'Newly', 'released', 'DVD', 'Zeitgeist', 'production', 'directed', 'Margarethe', 'von', 'Trotta', 'Barbara', 'Sukowa', 'enigmatic', 'twelfth', 'century', 'German', 'abbess', 'One', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'figures', 'Middle', 'Ages', 'Hildegard', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'mystic', 'author', 'musician', 'foundress', 'director', 'souls', 'learned', 'natural', 'sciences', 'as', 'well', 'theology', 'philosophy', 'wrote', 'first', 'mystery', 'plays', 'laying', 'groundwork', 'modern', 'drama', 'Madame', 'Sukowa', 'able', 'convey', 'inner', 'stillness', 'contemplative', 'spirit', 'Hildegard', 'strength', 'common', 'sense', 'while', 'very', 'human', 'side', 'saint', 'always', 'present', 'who', 'oppose', 'as', 'well', 'devil', 'herself.Resisting', 'temptation', 'make', 'film', 'piece', 'feminist', 'propaganda', 'Vision', 'Hildegard', 'obedient', 'daughter', 'Church', 'obedience', 'means', 'mere', 'childish', 'acquiescence', 'vow', 'obedience', 'too', 'often', 'misconstrued', 'expression', 'vibrant', 'faith', 'St.', 'Hildegard', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'firm', 'charitable', 'stand', 'injustice', 'will', 'brook', 'infractions', 'Rule', 'serene', 'disciplined', 'life', 'nuns', 'true', 'mother', 'ready', 'fight', 'death', 'spiritual', 'children.Because', 'film', 'commitment', 'authenticity', 'are', 'many', 'elements', 'medieval', 'life', 'such', 'custom', 'everyone', 'embracing', 'other', 'lips', 'odd', 'modern', 'sensibilities', 'Hildegard', 'deposited', 'nuns', 'when', 'still', 'small', 'child', 'gift', 'God', 'parents', 'cloister', 'only', 'world', 'ever', 'known', 'nuns', 'only', 'family', 'When', 'young', 'nun', 'Sister', 'Richardis', 'natural', 'daughter', 'never', 'had', 'Mother', 'Hildegard', 'strongly', 'Richardis', 'being', 'sent', 'away', 'become', 'abbess', 'community', 'first', 'saint', 'given', 'inordinate', 'attachment', 'eventually', 'clear', 'Hildegard', 'can', 'see', 'good', 'will', 'come', 'transfer', 'be', 'correct', 'exceptionally', 'powerful', 'scene', 'when', 'Hildegard', 'summoned', 'be', 'questioned', 'visions', 'several', 'formidable', 'churchmen', 'glower', 'anticipation', 'proving', 'be', 'crazy', 'woman', 'demoniac', 'Hildegard', 'such', 'calm', 'assurance', 'doubt', 'who', 'will', 'emerge', 'triumphant.Another', 'unique', 'aspect', 'film', 'rare', 'real', 'depiction', 'vocation', 'nuns', 'joyful', 'brides', 'lustrous', 'beauty', 'herb', 'austerity', 'monastic', 'halls', 'scene', 'light', 'beauty', 'suggest', 'more', 'living', 'what', 'eye', 'can', 'see', 'viewer', 'gently', 'continually', 'reminded', 'sacrificial', 'lifestyle', 'Mother', 'Hildegard', 'nuns', 'mysterious', 'sense', 'exultation', 'film', 'clear', 'Benedictines', 'have', 'renounced', 'world', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'return', 'gift', 'so', 'precious', 'price', '*NOTE', 'DVD', 'Vision', 'was', 'sent', 'producers', 'exchange', 'honest', 'opinion']",Vision - From the Life of Hildegard von Bingen

Launay,"[92, 100]","For my tastes, this was one of the top films of 2010 - a gorgeous biopic of a strongly willed nun of the Middle Ages who reinvented the meaning of spirituality for her time.  Barbara Sukowa gives a subtle, nuanced performance of this philosopher, mystic, herbalist, musician, playwright who insisted on creating a special cloister of female nuns against the wishes of the male religious hierarchy.  There were those after her, of course...one thinks of St. Theresa of Avila...but the accomplishments of Hildegard Von Bingen were certainly more varied.  For example, she created an entirely new kind of musical religious play.  She experimented with the healing power of herbs.What makes her portrayal so interesting in the movie is that she is not uni-dimensional.  At various times Hildegard Von Bingen appears submissive or strong,  compassionate or stern, independent and emotionally weak, hard headed and mystic.  The power of the actresses performance is that Hildegard's thoughts are not necessarily the same as her actions.I love the luscious historical background of those authentic, old European cloisters.

1412152,A140XH16IKR4B0,B004KCAYXC,Jean E. Pouliot,"[2, 3]","Saint Hildegard von Bingen get the star treatment in this wonderfully evocative film of her life. Hildegard is one of a number of unusual medieval women, who bucked the male-dominated church hierarchy to establish monasteries and gain prominence. Barbara Sukowa is absolutely stunning as Hildegard. She plays her with a combination of toughness and vulnerability that captures Hildegard's fierce internal drive as well as her deep emotional needs. A relationship with a younger nun borders on desperate attachment, but never crosses the line into the erotic.Hildegard was a pioneer in music and medicine. She wrote chants that are still enjoyable today. Her medicine, based on herbs and precious stones, may not be as useful today as it was in her day. But in combination with her certainty and tender patient care, it likely inspired the confidence that allowed healing to begin. Hildegard was also an able political tactician, playing off donors and supportive bishops against her clerical enemies.The film didn't do as well with portraying the vast difference between the medieval world and our own. Superstition, ignorance and extreme piety were extreme and accepted. While the film does show self-flagellation and spurious medical practices, it shows characters reacting much as moderns would - with revulsion at self-injury and bland acceptance of the power of crystals. And little was said about the value of Hildegard's heavenly visions, upon which her reputation hung. Probably a good thing - they might have made her seem silly or offputtingly pious. I wish too that more of Hildegard's ethereal music had made it into the film.But, given that I knew next to nothing about this extraordinary woman before viewing this work, I am grateful to have a visual peg to hang my future reading about her. The Catholic Church has just named her a Doctor of the Church. That alone should bring interest in her life.

Given to an abbey in childhood by her affluent parents, Hildegard (Barbara Sukowa) is elected magistra, or ""teacher"", in adulthood. Sickly and always hungry for knowledge, she continually conducts experiments to increase her knowledge of herbal medicine, passing it on to the other nuns, all while composing poems, songs, and dictating books of her religious visions. She claimed that God communicated with her through visions of a bright light. With the support of a sympathetic monk Brother Volmar (Heino Ferch), she is recognized as a visionary. But her commitment to building a separate abbey for her nuns places her at odds with the Abbott (Alexander Held) to whom she has sworn obedience.Hildegard von Bingen actually founded two abbeys. Many of her accomplishments have been omitted or hinted at in order to focus on her interactions with Jutta (Lena Stolze), a nun with whom she was raised, and her favorite pupil, the spirited young Richardis von Stade (Hannah Herzsprung). These relationships are used to illuminate Hildegard's character, but I'm not sure how much could realistically be known about them. She was quite accomplished as a scientist and composer. She corresponded with popes and kings in a time when it was hardly possible for a woman to contemplate such ambition. And she was later canonized. Margarethe von Trotta's treatment has a transcendental quality, which she has chosen over a litany of Hildegard's accomplishments. This is effective, if a little open-ended, but it sometimes left me wanting more facts.The DVD (Zeitgeist 2011): There are three interviews with director Margarethe von Trotta. ""Margarethe von Trotta Tribute and Q&A; with Annette Insdorf and Barbara Sukowa"" (27 min) was filmed at Telluride in 2009, when von Trotta received an award. Sukowa introduces the director, and Insdorf, a professor from Columbia University, interviews her. ""Margarethe von Trotta Interview with Gary Giddons"" (12 min) is also from Telluride. Giddons is a film writer. ""Goethe-Institute Q&A;"" (40 min) is a 2010 conversation with von Trotta and writer Robert Boyers. There is also a US theatrical trailer (2 min).

1412155,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B004KCAYXC,"Promise ""promise""","[2, 3]","I had heard Hildegard von Bingen's music but only knew a little about her life.  I think I expected the film to be somewhat dreary and dark so I  was wonderfully surprised.  I have no idea how accurate the portrayal of the lives of the nuns is.  Some reviewers think that the film overly modernized them.  Others felt that significant portions of Hildegard's life were omitted.  Still others (quite a few) objected to seeing the nuns and priests kissing on the lips!  I guess my ignorance served me well because I enjoyed every bit of it.  If I had any criticism it's that the star, although a brilliant actress, seemed a little too  robust for the role.  Hildegard described herself as physically weak and I would have expected a more delicate, ethereal type woman.  The supporting cast is very good.  I particularly liked the man who played Hildegard's long-time support and friend. Besides his usual benign face he is terrific when he's playing the devil in their play.  The young woman who plays Hildegard's protegee is luminously lovely.The film is visually sumptuous, even though most of it is set inside convents and monasteries where the prevailing color is black.  Perhaps it does over-emphasize what we would consider feminist principles but I didn't find it objectionable.  I thought the film maker struck a good balance between presenting Hildegard's visionary life and her practical one.I think this is a very enjoyable film for a wide range of people.  I'm not Catholic and I loved it.  It is in German with subtitles so if this upsets you, stay away.  Also beware....there is some kissing on the lips!  :-)",5,Beautiful!,1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,1621,"['had', 'heard', 'Hildegard', 'von', 'Bingen', 'music', 'only', 'knew', 'little', 'life', 'think', 'expected', 'film', 'be', 'somewhat', 'dreary', 'dark', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'surprised', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'lives', 'nuns', 'reviewers', 'think', 'film', 'overly', 'modernized', 'Others', 'felt', 'significant', 'portions', 'Hildegard', 'life', 'were', 'omitted', 'Still', 'others', 'quite', 'few', 'objected', 'seeing', 'nuns', 'priests', 'kissing', 'lips', 'guess', 'ignorance', 'served', 'well', 'enjoyed', 'bit', 'had', 'criticism', 'star', 'brilliant', 'actress', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'robust', 'role', 'Hildegard', 'described', 'physically', 'weak', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'more', 'delicate', 'ethereal', 'type', 'woman', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'particularly', 'liked', 'man', 'who', 'played', 'Hildegard', 'long-time', 'support', 'friend', 'usual', 'benign', 'face', 'terrific', 'when', 'playing', 'devil', 'play', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'Hildegard', 'protegee', 'luminously', 'lovely.The', 'film', 'visually', 'sumptuous', 'even', 'most', 'set', 'convents', 'monasteries', 'where', 'prevailing', 'color', 'black', 'Perhaps', 'over-emphasize', 'what', 'would', 'consider', 'feminist', 'principles', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'objectionable', 'thought', 'film', 'maker', 'struck', 'good', 'balance', 'presenting', 'Hildegard', 'visionary', 'life', 'practical', 'one.I', 'think', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'wide', 'range', 'people', ""'m"", 'not', 'Catholic', 'loved', 'German', 'subtitles', 'so', 'stay', 'away', 'Also', 'beware', 'kissing', 'lips']",Vision - From the Life of Hildegard von Bingen

1412157,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B004KCAYXC,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[32, 35]","This movie is beautifully filmed and interesting, but offers a cold and superficial interpretation of Hildegard, tainted by secular historical revisionism. It is the sort of movie that attempts to depict a Christian mystic as admirable, but quite apart from the mystic's relationship with God, leaving a half-sketched caricature as protagonist. Rather than evoking the real Hildegard through her writings and spirituality, this film chooses to focus on how she got want she wanted through intelligence and cunning, inviting us to admire her political will rather than any sort of religious wisdom or example she might have offered. The content of her visions is barely touched upon, with the director inviting us to admire Hildegard as a proto-feminist who simply happened to be a nun. The problem is that Hildegard was a nun who happened to be a proto-feminist, not vice versa, and her relationship with Jesus in prayer is central to understanding her. As a result, one walks away from this film with a mild interest in medieval politics, but without any sort of deep insight into Hildegard's personality or understanding of her as a real person. She remains as remote from the viewer as the director is from God. An intriguing film for agnostics, perhaps, even though it is neither gripping nor involving. I'm glad I saw it, and it is certainly worth a rental, but I would not encourage others to actually purchase it. For a much better example of an avant garde European treatment of a Catholic saint, check out the ""Therese"" film that won at Cannes in 1986. It is neither preachy nor fawning, but at least gives you a sense of who Therese of Lisieux was and what she believed, whether you agree with it or not.",1,Interesting but superficial,1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,1714,"['movie', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'interesting', 'cold', 'superficial', 'interpretation', 'Hildegard', 'tainted', 'secular', 'historical', 'revisionism', 'sort', 'movie', 'depict', 'Christian', 'mystic', 'admirable', 'quite', 'apart', 'mystic', 'relationship', 'God', 'leaving', 'half-sketched', 'caricature', 'protagonist', 'Rather', 'evoking', 'real', 'Hildegard', 'writings', 'spirituality', 'film', 'focus', 'how', 'got', 'want', 'wanted', 'intelligence', 'cunning', 'inviting', 'admire', 'political', 'will', 'rather', 'sort', 'religious', 'wisdom', 'example', 'might', 'have', 'offered', 'content', 'visions', 'barely', 'touched', 'director', 'inviting', 'admire', 'Hildegard', 'proto-feminist', 'who', 'simply', 'happened', 'be', 'nun', 'problem', 'Hildegard', 'was', 'nun', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'proto-feminist', 'not', 'vice', 'versa', 'relationship', 'Jesus', 'prayer', 'central', 'understanding', 'result', 'one', 'away', 'film', 'mild', 'interest', 'medieval', 'politics', 'sort', 'deep', 'insight', 'Hildegard', 'personality', 'understanding', 'real', 'person', 'remote', 'viewer', 'director', 'God', 'intriguing', 'film', 'agnostics', 'perhaps', 'even', 'gripping', 'involving', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'certainly', 'worth', 'rental', 'would', 'not', 'encourage', 'others', 'actually', 'purchase', 'much', 'better', 'example', 'avant', 'garde', 'European', 'treatment', 'Catholic', 'saint', 'check', 'out', 'Therese', 'film', 'won', 'Cannes', '1986', 'preachy', 'fawning', 'least', 'sense', 'who', 'Therese', 'Lisieux', 'was', 'what', 'believed', 'agree', 'not']",Vision - From the Life of Hildegard von Bingen
