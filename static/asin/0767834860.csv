It's well narrated by Dudley Moore and has some well-utilized classical works in the soundtrack. The early farm sequences are a lot of fun, and there's some exciting encounters with other animals that should be entertaining to all ages.The rumor of animal abuse that hangs over this film is worrisome, but it's never been substantiated as far as I've read; without any damning evidence I don't think it's wrong to watch and enjoy a warm-hearted family movie made many years ago.It's a very good family movie that I recommend to everyone.",5,"Too cute?

20426,A19H1KSVMYKVHQ,0767834860,"AliCat ""soul drifter""","[3, 5]","I bought this for my son, and when he saw the front cover he immediatly wanted to see it. He simply referred to it as just Otis he has a hard time saying Milo for some reason. I was very happy I bought it, and that he wanted to watch it with me since normally he only wants to watch cartoon DVD's. My long-term memory could only pick up a yellow kitten floating in a box down a river, so I must admit I was just as excited to watch it again for the first time in over a decade.When I finished watching it I thought wow this is a really great movie. I read that it took 4 years to make, and I could see why every scene was absolutely perfect. The so-called ""animal abuse"" in this film should be overlooked, because animals on farms do have to deal with things like this, and the bear was obviously a trained animal, and he never hurt the dog or cat. I did feel kind of bad at first for the cat when he went down the waterfall, but I don't think he was really in there they had to have did some kind of trick, because I'm sure the cat would have fallen out and drowned if they hadn't.I won't spoil the end but I just think it was so cute, and this is a great movie for kids of all ages, especially toddlers because they get to see all the farm animals. My son just laughed and laughed at the ""doggie"" and ""kitty"", especially when Otis fell in this little hole.

20429,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0767834860,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 7]","This is one of those childhood spectacles that makes young and old alike feel so warm and cuddly inside.  I remember watching this as a toddler and up, sitting in my grandfather's basement and just soaking in this delightful little tale of a young kitten and his best friend; a pug-dog named Otis.  Yes, my adoration of dogs in general fueled my affections for the film, and as a child that was all that mattered to me (awww, they are so cute), but as an adult there is even more to be impressed with here.  Taking four years to make, director Masanori Hata really took his time to develop a story that felt honest and earnest, while allowing these two little creatures (unassisted by human voices, unless you count the narration) to speak volumes through their heroic play and general loveliness.  It may not be a complicated concept, but it is one that works wonders thanks to detailed and refined direction that shapes this beautiful family film into one for the ages.  It also works because within the simple story there are layers of emotional complexities shared, emotions that transcend mere child's-play or `animal-play' but reach the human heart.  This is a tale of friendship and loyalty and love.  As one reviewer mentioned, this is a celebration of life!  This movie is, without a doubt, something special.  And, to all of those reviewers barking about this being a sick movie because animals were obviously distressed and hurt (some even suggested `killed'), you should do a little more research before making such a blanket statement, especially when that said statement is made in light of information that has NOT BEEN CONFIRMED.  Sure, allegations abound here, and yes the film was not made in the states, but your perception of what you see on the screen is never what really happened (it's a movie, so they can make it look like anything happened) and one should never believe everything they read online.",5,What a wonderful adventure!,1313020800,"08 11, 2011",2011,1924,"['one', 'childhood', 'spectacles', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'feel', 'so', 'warm', 'cuddly', 'remember', 'watching', 'toddler', 'up', 'sitting', 'grandfather', 'basement', 'just', 'soaking', 'delightful', 'little', 'tale', 'young', 'kitten', 'best', 'friend', 'pug-dog', 'named', 'Otis', 'Yes', 'adoration', 'dogs', 'general', 'fueled', 'affections', 'film', 'child', 'was', 'mattered', 'awww', 'are', 'so', 'cute', 'adult', 'even', 'more', 'be', 'impressed', 'here', 'Taking', 'four', 'years', 'make', 'director', 'Masanori', 'Hata', 'really', 'took', 'time', 'develop', 'story', 'felt', 'honest', 'earnest', 'allowing', 'two', 'little', 'creatures', 'unassisted', 'human', 'voices', 'count', 'narration', 'speak', 'volumes', 'heroic', 'play', 'general', 'loveliness', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'complicated', 'concept', 'one', 'wonders', 'thanks', 'detailed', 'refined', 'direction', 'beautiful', 'family', 'film', 'one', 'ages', 'also', 'simple', 'story', 'are', 'layers', 'emotional', 'complexities', 'shared', 'emotions', 'transcend', 'mere', ""child's-play"", 'animal-play', 'reach', 'human', 'heart', 'tale', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'love', 'one', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'celebration', 'life', 'movie', 'doubt', 'something', 'special', 'reviewers', 'barking', 'being', 'sick', 'movie', 'animals', 'were', 'obviously', 'distressed', 'hurt', 'even', 'suggested', 'killed', 'should', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'research', 'making', 'such', 'blanket', 'statement', 'especially', 'when', 'said', 'statement', 'made', 'light', 'information', 'NOT', 'BEEN', 'CONFIRMED', 'Sure', 'allegations', 'abound', 'here', 'yes', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'states', 'perception', 'what', 'see', 'screen', 'never', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'movie', 'can', 'make', 'look', 'anything', 'happened', 'one', 'should', 'never', 'believe', 'everything', 'read', 'online']",N/A

It is a delightful AND troubling film.This is a simple but timeless story of adventure and friendship.  Milo the mischievous kitten and Otis the pug puppy are best friends.  Otis even pursues his friend when he's carried down the river after jumping into a wooden box.  Soon, both of them are lost as well as separated from each other.  The adventures they have with other animals are amazing, numerous and varied.  They interact with a bear cub, raccoon, fox, seagulls, a turtle, a fawn and many others.  The interactions will amaze you -- I couldn't believe a pug was riding on a turtle's back!The footage is incredible, and does make one worry about the animals.  While the director has said that the animals were raised together and are friends, and this is believable, it cannot account for the cat  being attacked by seagulls and later falling from a very high cliff into the ocean.

20436,AC6CJTL6YVFQV,0767834860,bilahn,"[7, 33]","Warning: Gives away the plot of the movie.Yes, Milo and Otis is very cute and well done as many reviewers have said.  I was enjoying it until near the end.As far as the animal treatment controversy, i think the reviewer below pretty well debunks most of these concerns. Even in the 80s and earlier trick photography could do some pretty amazing things, as anyone who  has seen many 70s horror films can attest.  I doubt any real harm was done to these animals. On the other hand, I am not sure standards in Japan in the 80s were what we would now expect, so I just have to reserve judgement.My complaint is one most people won't care about, but I do; the movie's  heterosexism. Now I hate to be in turn a homosexist;  I do not mean to disparage marriage or raising children in any way, because I do not feel that way. I also hate to take a simple children's story and make it so darn controversial. HOWEVER,For the first 3/4 of the movie  Milo and Otis is about male friendship, bonding, and heroism for each other. Then out of the blue appears ""Joyce"" who has absolutely nothing to offer Milo, as far as he can be aware,  other than being female. Otis, who just saved Milo's life, is out the window.  Milo doesn't care. Otis is devastated and goes off into the bitter cold snowy mountains, possibly to die. Is that a message to send kids - dump your closest buddy who saved you just for a girl?  I am not suggesting that Miloe and Otis were ""gay""  but this kind of hetero supremacy would do James Dobson proud.Then it gets worse:  Otis, out in the mountain, meets a girl-dog, and now he ""understands what came over Milo.""  This about made me  turn the thing off.I think it is fine to make a movie about animals getting married and having cute kittens and puppies - i am all for it, but this ended up totally negating the whole feeling of the first hour of the movie. It should have evolved differently and without such total disregard for each other.  In the end, the deep bond between Milo and Otis, which I thought was what this movie was about, ends up being trivialized.",3,"Cute, but left a bad taste in my mouth",1151280000,"06 26, 2006",2006,2075,"['Warning', 'away', 'plot', 'movie.Yes', 'Milo', 'Otis', 'very', 'cute', 'well', 'done', 'many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'was', 'enjoying', 'end.As', 'far', 'animal', 'treatment', 'controversy', 'i', 'think', 'reviewer', 'pretty', 'well', 'most', 'concerns', 'Even', '80s', 'earlier', 'trick', 'photography', 'could', 'do', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'things', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'many', '70s', 'horror', 'films', 'can', 'attest', 'doubt', 'real', 'harm', 'was', 'done', 'animals', 'other', 'hand', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'standards', 'Japan', '80s', 'were', 'what', 'would', 'now', 'expect', 'just', 'have', 'reserve', 'judgement.My', 'complaint', 'one', 'most', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'do', 'movie', 'heterosexism', 'Now', 'hate', 'be', 'turn', 'homosexist', 'do', 'not', 'mean', 'disparage', 'marriage', 'raising', 'children', 'way', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'way', 'also', 'hate', 'take', 'simple', 'children', 'story', 'make', 'so', 'darn', 'controversial', 'HOWEVER', 'first', '3/4', 'movie', 'Milo', 'Otis', 'male', 'friendship', 'bonding', 'heroism', 'other', 'Then', 'blue', 'Joyce', 'who', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'offer', 'Milo', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'be', 'aware', 'other', 'being', 'female', 'Otis', 'who', 'just', 'saved', 'Milo', 'life', 'out', 'window', 'Milo', ""n't"", 'care', 'Otis', 'devastated', 'off', 'bitter', 'cold', 'snowy', 'mountains', 'possibly', 'die', 'message', 'send', 'kids', 'dump', 'closest', 'buddy', 'who', 'saved', 'just', 'girl', 'am', 'not', 'suggesting', 'Miloe', 'Otis', 'were', 'gay', 'kind', 'hetero', 'supremacy', 'would', 'do', 'James', 'Dobson', 'proud.Then', 'worse', 'Otis', 'mountain', 'girl-dog', 'now', 'what', 'came', 'over', 'Milo', 'made', 'turn', 'thing', 'off.I', 'think', 'fine', 'make', 'movie', 'animals', 'getting', 'married', 'having', 'cute', 'kittens', 'puppies', 'i', 'am', 'ended', 'up', 'totally', 'negating', 'whole', 'feeling', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'evolved', 'differently', 'such', 'total', 'disregard', 'other', 'end', 'deep', 'bond', 'Milo', 'Otis', 'thought', 'was', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'up', 'being', 'trivialized']",N/A

If you want to argue with me about this then find me the review!here is a video review from Ebert and Roeper in which they further debunks these statements:[...]Anyone who keeps going on and on about how such technology did not exist in 1986 therefore logically concluding that cruelty must have occurred: unless you have studied film making and the history of film making or are a professional in the industry, you cannot make such claims, you really have no proof at all except your own opinions!For everyone crying about the bear brutalizing Otis: Masanori Hata has interviewed with journalist Margo Kaufman of Pug World and stated that the bear cub and the Otis puppy used in that scene had been raised together and were friends. In that scene they were just playing and messing around.About the cliff: I have so far seen people describe this cliff as 200ft, 100ft, 50ft, 20ft and 10ft! People are just sitting around making up numbers! No one has any actual proof about how tall the cliff was. No one has proof about whether the cat chose to jump or was tossed and whether the cat jumped off of that particular cliff or if the image of the cat jumping was edited or whatnot. no one has proof whether cats died. people are literally sitting around, making things up working themselves up into an outraged state and then screaming about it on the internet!For the people who say that the 'no animals were harmed' tag is missing: I'm not a lawyer for this Milo and Otis movie and I don't know what the tagging standards are for animal movies. it is possible that they did not include this tag because two animals WERE indirectly harmed/killed. The fish Milo catches with his tail and the field mouse that the owl grabs. And possibly the scene where milo is messing with he crab and his cheek gets pinched. it is wrong to assume that 10/20/29 milos died and 9-20 otises drowned just because of a missing tag. You must do actual research, call Fuji Television Network, call Columbia Pictures, call Masanori Hata, call Mark Saltzman, call the American Humane Society! Don't just rely on some nitwits freaking out on the internet and for goodness sakes don't keep propagating unverified rumors!If you have not done research and have actual proof you should not be running around writing things like this because it will ruin the movie for other people! When I first heard 20 Milos were killed I was devastated! Imagine how many other people are being hurt and hating this movie because of rumors like this?The only reason why I am not giving this DVD 5 stars is because I wanted to see the original 90 minute Japanese version and it is not included in this disk, nor is there a Japanese track or subtitles.",4,PLEASE STOP VIOLATING THE INNOCENCE OF THIS MOVIE WITH UNVERIFIED RUMORS!,1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,3099,"['sheer', 'amount', 'one', 'star', 'gurgling', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'First', 'such', 'thing', 'AMERICAN', 'HUMAN', 'SOCIETY', 'so', 'anyone', 'saying', 'such', 'organization', 'least', '29', 'Milos', 'died', 'just', 'allowing', 'be', 'misled', 'American', 'HumanE', 'Society', 'never', 'released', 'such', 'statement', 'fact', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'reviewed', 'Milo', 'Otis', 'want', 'argue', 'then', 'find', 'review', 'here', 'video', 'review', 'Ebert', 'Roeper', 'further', 'debunks', 'statements', '[', 'Anyone', 'who', 'going', 'how', 'such', 'technology', 'did', 'not', 'exist', '1986', 'therefore', 'logically', 'concluding', 'cruelty', 'must', 'have', 'occurred', 'have', 'studied', 'film', 'making', 'history', 'film', 'making', 'are', 'professional', 'industry', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'such', 'claims', 'really', 'have', 'proof', 'own', 'opinions', 'everyone', 'crying', 'bear', 'brutalizing', 'Otis', 'Masanori', 'Hata', 'interviewed', 'journalist', 'Margo', 'Kaufman', 'Pug', 'World', 'stated', 'bear', 'cub', 'Otis', 'puppy', 'used', 'scene', 'had', 'been', 'raised', 'together', 'were', 'friends', 'scene', 'were', 'just', 'playing', 'messing', 'cliff', 'have', 'so', 'far', 'seen', 'people', 'describe', 'cliff', '200ft', '100ft', '50ft', '20ft', '10ft', 'People', 'are', 'just', 'sitting', 'around', 'making', 'up', 'numbers', 'one', 'actual', 'proof', 'how', 'tall', 'cliff', 'was', 'one', 'proof', 'cat', 'chose', 'jump', 'was', 'tossed', 'cat', 'jumped', 'particular', 'cliff', 'image', 'cat', 'jumping', 'was', 'edited', 'whatnot', 'one', 'proof', 'cats', 'died', 'people', 'are', 'literally', 'sitting', 'around', 'making', 'things', 'up', 'working', 'up', 'outraged', 'state', 'then', 'screaming', 'internet', 'people', 'who', 'say', ""'no"", 'animals', 'were', 'harmed', 'tag', 'missing', ""'m"", 'not', 'lawyer', 'Milo', 'Otis', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'tagging', 'standards', 'are', 'animal', 'movies', 'possible', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'tag', 'two', 'animals', 'WERE', 'indirectly', 'harmed/killed', 'fish', 'Milo', 'catches', 'tail', 'field', 'mouse', 'owl', 'grabs', 'possibly', 'scene', 'where', 'milo', 'messing', 'crab', 'cheek', 'pinched', 'wrong', 'assume', '10/20/29', 'milos', 'died', '9-20', 'otises', 'drowned', 'just', 'missing', 'tag', 'must', 'do', 'actual', 'research', 'call', 'Fuji', 'Television', 'Network', 'call', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', 'call', 'Masanori', 'Hata', 'call', 'Mark', 'Saltzman', 'call', 'American', 'Humane', 'Society', 'Do', ""n't"", 'just', 'rely', 'nitwits', 'freaking', 'out', 'internet', 'goodness', 'sakes', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'propagating', 'unverified', 'rumors', 'have', 'not', 'done', 'research', 'have', 'actual', 'proof', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'running', 'around', 'writing', 'things', 'will', 'ruin', 'movie', 'other', 'people', 'When', 'first', 'heard', '20', 'Milos', 'were', 'killed', 'was', 'devastated', 'Imagine', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'hurt', 'hating', 'movie', 'rumors', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'am', 'not', 'giving', 'DVD', '5', 'stars', 'wanted', 'see', 'original', '90', 'minute', 'Japanese', 'version', 'not', 'included', 'disk', 'there', 'Japanese', 'track', 'subtitles']",N/A

A dog in search of a lost cat? Forgive me while I scoff in disbelief.It's movies like ""The Adventures of Milo and Otis"" that give children ideas about how to rebel against society. Milo tells us that it's okay to jump on a raft and get swept down a set of treacherous rapids. Otis tells us that it's okay to confront ferocious grizzly bears, and that a cute little wag of the tail will make everything alright.

There's all of Milo's hiding places on the farm, Milo's adventures down waterfalls and off cliffs, Otis' struggle with a bear, Otis' ride on the back of a turtle during high tide. How did they manage it all? A friend who I was watching with suggested the turtle wasn't real when it was shown being ridden on. I don't know about that myself, I think it's hard to say...The story is of Milo the cat and Otis the dog, who grow up as kitten and puppy on the farm, helping look after the chickens' eggs and playing hide and seek among other things. One of Milo's hiding places is a box on the river, but this ends up drifting downstream, with Milo helpless inside. Otis follows Milo, and during the adventures to come back together and get back to the farm, they both grow up a lot.Dudley Moore does the narration, and I think he does a charming job, and helps make the funny moments funnier. The beginning of the film is a lot faster paced than I remember when I was a kid in the cinema, which was surprising. It's interesting to hear how Dudley keeps up with all the farm scenes coming one after the other. I love the scenery out in the wild too, with it's rivers and forests and greenery.

Wallace ""kirby at  wallaceinfo dee-o...","[9, 14]","Milo &amp; Otis is a charming, if juvenile (it's supposed to be) movie about a long journey, and curious encounters undertaken by two friends - a cat and a dog.The scenery and cinemetography are wonderful - even spellbinding, but nowhere in the credits does it say where it is filmed.  If it's Japan, then Japan has a wonderfully northwestern European look to it.  The &quot;river&quot; looks so cool and refreshing that I often wondered how refreshing a drink from it might be.Beautiful scenery aside, it's obvious to the adults that most of it is contrived.  There really aren't any farms anymore that have &quot;all the animals.&quot;  And let's face it, a sea turtle just doesn't &quot;stop by&quot; to let a dog ride on it's back.  But again, in the child's perpective, it's wonderfully casual.For the adults, Duddly Moore's narration is a bit annoying sometimes, but it is, after all, directed at kids.  My two year old insists on watching it at least twice a day (for now - past obsessions include Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life), so I suppose it worked as planned, and I've sat through it at least four or five times myself.One other reviewer mentioned the possible animal abuse.  The film credits do indeed say that the animals were closely supervised, but that didn't stop them from being their own, unwitting &quot;stunt men.&quot;  I don't think anything amounted to animal abuse, and I certainly don't think any died.  Although they pushed the limits by throwing a cat off a small cliff into the sea!  It wasn't harmed, and the cat swam to shore and shook it off pretty easily.  Still...Parents will see the bittersweet nature of the ending.  Sure, Milo &amp; Otis go home.  But they never &quot;go home.&quot;  Who can?  By the end of the movie, their happy childhood is spent, so even getting back to the farm will not restore them to their first innocence.But this is all happily lost on the young child who sees only the magical journey and many strange encounters of Milo &amp; Otis; two friends - a cat and a dog.",4,Big hit with MY 2 year old!,993686400,"06 28, 2001",2001,2030,"['Milo', 'amp', 'Otis', 'charming', 'juvenile', 'supposed', 'be', 'movie', 'long', 'journey', 'curious', 'encounters', 'undertaken', 'two', 'friends', 'cat', 'dog.The', 'scenery', 'cinemetography', 'are', 'wonderful', 'even', 'spellbinding', 'nowhere', 'credits', 'say', 'where', 'filmed', 'Japan', 'then', 'Japan', 'wonderfully', 'northwestern', 'European', 'look', 'quot', 'river', 'quot', 'so', 'cool', 'refreshing', 'often', 'wondered', 'how', 'refreshing', 'drink', 'might', 'be.Beautiful', 'scenery', 'aside', 'obvious', 'adults', 'most', 'contrived', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'farms', 'anymore', 'have', 'quot', 'animals.', 'quot', 'let', 'face', 'sea', 'turtle', 'just', ""n't"", 'quot', 'stop', 'quot', 'let', 'dog', 'ride', 'back', 'again', 'child', 'perpective', 'wonderfully', 'casual.For', 'adults', 'Duddly', 'Moore', 'narration', 'bit', 'annoying', 'sometimes', 'directed', 'kids', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'insists', 'watching', 'least', 'twice', 'day', 'now', 'past', 'obsessions', 'include', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life', 'so', 'suppose', 'worked', 'planned', ""'ve"", 'sat', 'least', 'four', 'five', 'times', 'myself.One', 'other', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'possible', 'animal', 'abuse', 'film', 'credits', 'do', 'indeed', 'say', 'animals', 'were', 'closely', 'supervised', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'being', 'own', 'unwitting', 'quot', 'stunt', 'men.', 'quot', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'amounted', 'animal', 'abuse', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'died', 'pushed', 'limits', 'throwing', 'cat', 'small', 'cliff', 'sea', 'was', ""n't"", 'harmed', 'cat', 'swam', 'shore', 'shook', 'off', 'pretty', 'easily', 'Still', 'Parents', 'will', 'see', 'bittersweet', 'nature', 'ending', 'Sure', 'Milo', 'amp', 'Otis', 'go', 'home', 'never', 'quot', 'go', 'home.', 'quot', 'Who', 'can', 'end', 'movie', 'happy', 'childhood', 'spent', 'so', 'even', 'getting', 'back', 'farm', 'will', 'not', 'restore', 'first', 'innocence.But', 'happily', 'lost', 'young', 'child', 'who', 'only', 'magical', 'journey', 'many', 'strange', 'encounters', 'Milo', 'amp', 'Otis', 'two', 'friends', 'cat', 'dog']",N/A

I can say that this film is amazing in what they accomplished with these animals and Dudley Moore is awesome as the narrator, but the editing was kind of awkward which is understandable when you are piecing fragments of non-cohesive shots. i watched this becuase it is a remarkable achievement as a film. but really, everything that you see in the film is a very basic, and usually very obvious, camera trick made to allude that it was more ""dangerous"" than it realy was. first off, the japanese man who made this owns a farm and is a devote animal lover so I strongly doubt he would have allowed an animal to be killed. Also, its a trivia fact that ONLY 4 cats were used this film and that was only to show an age progression. really, their was no assembly line of death in this movie. So lets break down the ""stunts"" in the film.1. the scene where the pug and bear ""fight"". The bear in this film was obviously domesticated and was really only playing rough with the dog because by nature, bears play rough. the dog was only slapped on his hind by the bear and not even scratched because it was not an attack, it was play that was meant to look like one with the magic of editing. He did get dunked in the water a few times though which was kind of funny.2. the box scene where the cat drops off a waterfall. the cat coudnt have been injured. the fall was made to look bigger than it really was with the use of the camera and really coudnt have been more than five feet, and cats are very limber and can sustain a much greater fall than that on solid ground.3. Seagulls pecking the cat? I didnt see a single seagull even touch the cat. the cat was just running around all erratic to make the situation look really distressing. One gull lifted his wings up to stand his ground from the cat, that was pretty much it.4. Now the big one, the cliff drop. If you look at the actual shot, you will notice the cat really only fell about a quarter of the way into the ocean but was filmed in a way to suggest that he had fallen from the top.5. heres a funny one, one person actually believed that the fish really bit the cats tail which is really laughable. the fish that you saw being dragged by the cat was a dead fish prop attached to the cats tail, and then was replaced with a live fish flopping on the ground in the next shot. this film must have been exhausting to make.6. oh yeah, the crab that pinched the cats cheek. well...ok, that was real. you got me that time. even though that crab was smaller than a baby kitten and could not have broken through his skin.7. Were they psychologically harmed? doubtful. the average cat or dog owner does far more psychologically damaging things to their pet, you strap a leash on them. you confine them to your backyards. put them in cages to transport them like cargo. really, its a subjective viewpoint.You know how I know that animals were really looked after intensely when this was made? because the editing is clumsy as hell. If they really were at a complete disregard for animal safety, then they could have gotten these shots to flow much easier and it wouldnt have taken them four years to make it.If there are any more that i missed, you could probably figure them out for yourself if you stop watching it in such an emotional state and look at it like a film. I suppose the reason they did not include the message ""no animals were harmed...."" is becuase that was not the standard in 1980's Japan at the time, and instead the message ""all animals were treated under the care of supervisors with regard to their safety...etc."" was used instead. trust me, i watched the entire film with every allegation that people have made about it in mind and would be surprised if any animal was even injured in the making of this film.",5,Anyone who really believes that animals could have been...,1142553600,"03 17, 2006",2006,3901,"['.killed', 'film', 'retard', 'thing', '20', 'cats', 'being', 'killed', 'rumour', 'was', 'bred', 'paranoia', 'ignorance', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'amazing', 'what', 'accomplished', 'animals', 'Dudley', 'Moore', 'awesome', 'narrator', 'editing', 'was', 'kind', 'awkward', 'understandable', 'when', 'are', 'piecing', 'fragments', 'non-cohesive', 'shots', 'i', 'watched', 'becuase', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'film', 'really', 'everything', 'see', 'film', 'very', 'basic', 'usually', 'very', 'obvious', 'camera', 'trick', 'made', 'allude', 'was', 'more', 'dangerous', 'was', 'first', 'japanese', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'farm', 'devote', 'animal', 'lover', 'so', 'strongly', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'animal', 'be', 'killed', 'Also', 'trivia', 'fact', 'ONLY', '4', 'cats', 'were', 'used', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'show', 'age', 'progression', 'really', 'was', 'assembly', 'line', 'death', 'movie', 'So', 'break', 'down', 'stunts', 'film.1', 'scene', 'where', 'pug', 'bear', 'fight', 'bear', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'domesticated', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'playing', 'dog', 'nature', 'bears', 'play', 'rough', 'dog', 'was', 'only', 'slapped', 'hind', 'bear', 'not', 'even', 'scratched', 'was', 'not', 'attack', 'was', 'play', 'was', 'meant', 'look', 'one', 'magic', 'editing', 'did', 'get', 'dunked', 'water', 'few', 'times', 'was', 'kind', 'funny.2', 'box', 'scene', 'where', 'cat', 'waterfall', 'cat', 'coudnt', 'have', 'been', 'injured', 'fall', 'was', 'made', 'look', 'bigger', 'really', 'was', 'use', 'camera', 'really', 'coudnt', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'five', 'feet', 'cats', 'are', 'very', 'limber', 'can', 'sustain', 'much', 'greater', 'fall', 'solid', 'ground.3', 'Seagulls', 'pecking', 'cat', 'didnt', 'see', 'single', 'seagull', 'even', 'cat', 'cat', 'was', 'just', 'running', 'around', 'erratic', 'make', 'situation', 'look', 'really', 'distressing', 'One', 'gull', 'lifted', 'wings', 'stand', 'ground', 'cat', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'it.4', 'Now', 'big', 'one', 'cliff', 'drop', 'look', 'actual', 'shot', 'will', 'notice', 'cat', 'really', 'only', 'fell', 'quarter', 'way', 'ocean', 'was', 'filmed', 'way', 'suggest', 'had', 'fallen', 'top.5', 'funny', 'one', 'one', 'person', 'actually', 'believed', 'fish', 'really', 'cats', 'tail', 'really', 'laughable', 'fish', 'saw', 'being', 'dragged', 'cat', 'was', 'dead', 'fish', 'prop', 'attached', 'cats', 'tail', 'then', 'was', 'replaced', 'live', 'fish', 'flopping', 'ground', 'next', 'shot', 'film', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'exhausting', 'make.6', 'oh', 'yeah', 'crab', 'pinched', 'cats', 'cheek', 'well', 'ok', 'was', 'real', 'got', 'time', 'even', 'crab', 'was', 'smaller', 'baby', 'kitten', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'broken', 'skin.7', 'Were', 'psychologically', 'harmed', 'doubtful', 'average', 'cat', 'dog', 'owner', 'far', 'more', 'psychologically', 'damaging', 'things', 'pet', 'strap', 'leash', 'confine', 'backyards', 'put', 'cages', 'transport', 'cargo', 'really', 'subjective', 'viewpoint.You', 'know', 'how', 'know', 'animals', 'were', 'really', 'looked', 'intensely', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'editing', 'clumsy', 'hell', 'really', 'were', 'complete', 'disregard', 'animal', 'safety', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'shots', 'flow', 'much', 'easier', 'have', 'taken', 'four', 'years', 'make', 'it.If', 'are', 'more', 'i', 'missed', 'could', 'probably', 'figure', 'out', 'stop', 'watching', 'such', 'emotional', 'state', 'look', 'film', 'suppose', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'message', 'animals', 'were', 'harmed', 'becuase', 'was', 'not', 'standard', '1980', 'Japan', 'time', 'instead', 'message', 'animals', 'were', 'treated', 'care', 'supervisors', 'regard', 'safety', 'etc', 'was', 'used', 'instead', 'trust', 'i', 'watched', 'entire', 'film', 'allegation', 'people', 'have', 'made', 'mind', 'would', 'be', 'surprised', 'animal', 'was', 'even', 'injured', 'making', 'film']",N/A

Filmed in Japanese, Milo and Otis has been re narrated in English by Dudley Moore (he plays every characters so if you don't like him, don't watch) and also had English music added.  The music is warm and folksy and perfectly fits the movie.  The cinematography is great.  In fact, it took four years for them to film this since they were working with live animals.It starts out on a small farm where a litter of kittens is being born.  Milo is one of those kittens.  From the very beginning he is always getting himself in trouble and is very eager to explore the world around him.  He makes friends with Otis, a pug puppy who also lives on the farm.  Together they have adventures, play games, and generally make a nuisance of themselves.One day, Milo takes it too far.  Playing hide n' seek in a box in the river, the box becomes detached and starts traveling down the fast moving water.  It travels a long way from the farm, with Otis trailing behind to try to save his friend.The adventure officially begun, the two animals must overcome many hardships to be reunited.  They meet several wild animals, some friendly, some not.  Milo just tries to survive while Otis searches for him.When they are finally reunited, something else comes along to break them apart.  However, as it is not life ending, they are able to overcome it and become the best of friends, traveling to get back home.There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this movie.  Claims of animal cruelty and animal death to make the movie abound.  Having searched the web, I came to the conclusion that this can be neither proved nor disproved.  Also, one must look at what actually animal cruelty is.  A lot of people are upset about the scene between Milo and the crab, however, the director did not make the crab pinch him, they were two animals doing what came naturally.  Also, there are complaints about the animals being distressed.  I wonder if these same people complain about horses in distress in war movies that are made where the whites of their eyes are showing and they are forced onto the ground in mock battle.  I'm not advocating animal cruelty or its use in movies, but I think its a very fine line to judge this movie as so.  Until its proven, I believe the movie should be judged on its merits, not what people think happened to the animals.  Innocent until proven guilty.  And now I'll step off my soapbox.Suitability for very young children could also be questioned.  There are live scenes of both a  cat and a dog giving birth in the movie.  The camera doesn't cut away, but instead shows one of each animal being born.  This might  be disturbing for some young viewers, however, more likely it will inspire loads of questions for mom and dad.  While it wouldn't bother me to show it to my future children, some parents may want to be handy with the fast forward button.Since I was a child this movie has been one of my favorites.

I don't know if those rumors are true or not. What I DO know is that animals were tortured to make this movie.1. In order for Otis to rescue Milo from a bear, the film makers put the little dog and a bear cub together and filmed whatever would happen. The cub seemed to want to play with the dog. It would take it's large paws and swat at it, knocking the dog around like it was a stuffed animal. Keep in mind, even though it was a bear cub, it could break the dog's back like it was a twig. The bear may not have been mean, but the whole scene was an accident waiting to happen. It is incredibly irresponsible to put a little dog in this situation. And the dog was NOT enjoying it. If you watch his body language, he was scared to death and fighting for his life.2. A cat is put in a box and sent down a river. If you watch the movie, there are several moments when the box looks like it will come to shore and the cat would be able to jump out. But that's when they cut the tape and push the cat back out so that it can plummet down a waterfall. In the footage they show, the cat survived. But...that's in the footage that made it in the movie. I would hate to see the outtakes.3. They put the cat in a tree with a snake. Maybe the snake wasn't poisonous. Maybe the snake wouldn't bite the cat. But the cat clearly did not know this and it was scared to death. I do not agree that any animal should be put in a state of fear for the sake of making a movie. If an animal is used for a movie, any ""acting"" it does should be something the animal enjoys doing.4. They throw the cat down a deep hole.5. They throw the cat off a cliff into water below near large rocks with big waves crashed on them. First of all, anybody that throws a cat off anything should be arrested and locked away. There is absolutely NO excuse for this. Second, the person that threw the cat into the water could easily have missed and the cat could have landed on the rocks. Third, even after the cat survives the fall, it panics and tries to climb back up the cliff, only to fall back into the water and have a giant wave crash onto it, slamming it into the rocks. This is ALL ON FILM! It is NOT a rumor. They even narrated for it! After the cat falls again the narrator goes ""Oops! Try try again!"" in a cute way as if this cruel display was in any way cute.6.

The story is a heavily narrated thing overlaid over animals that are doing what animals do, which is to say their handlers (you can even see one at one point) put them in strange situations and film it as if it's actual acting.I found a few parts where Milo was clearly under genuine duress: 1) Fell/pushed (who knows) into a stream where he swims and his mom chases him down. Cats don't like water! 2) A part where the handlers put him next to a crab to play with, it latches onto his nose, and he tries to get it off. Clearly, that hurt. 3) His handlers put him on a tree next to a bird that's distressed, squaking, trying to scare him away from its chicks. He ends up hitting it with his paw several times as the thing tries to ward him off.There was a part with Otis ""fighting"" a bear in the water, but I wonder if in fact he was basically drowning/panicked in real life.All very strange.

First is the bear and Otis fighting in the river. BOTH animals could have drowned and maybe one or more did when you consider Otis' size and that the bear's mouth looks glued shut. Then there is the scene where Milo gets pecked by seagulls and thrown from the cliff. This one used to really bother me when I was a kid. Looking at it now it's clear no seagull touched a cat and the cliff-jump was from a much shorter distance than I recall. Super slo-mo makes it look a lot worse than it really was. Lastly there is the scene with Otis on the rock in the rough ocean. For the 1st minute it's  one dog then the water calms and the tortoise comes it's a different dog on the rock. I always wondered what happened to the first dog.I'm sure the makers of this movie did not intend to purposely harm any animals and I do not belive the reports of 29 Milos or 10 Otises dying, but neither do I believe the director when he says no animals were harmed or Otis and the bear were friends and just playing.

It was simple yet touching on so many levels.  With only a single narrator, you could call this a DVD Audio Book of outstanding quality.  The animals reactions and narration and film score combine to become to make this one of the most memorable films for children and adults ever.  I watched it again for the first time in no telling how long, and my eyes absolutely watered at the end.  Every emotion from my boyhood came rushing back--something truely overwhelming for a recent high school graduate soon to go on to bigger things in life.  Kids should see movies like this, not just because it keeps them quiet while the parents can have a rest, but so they can have something to remember their best years of life.

I havent seen it in forever, but I still remember loving it. Its really cute and sincere. You cant help but smile. I know I did some research on it and read that it took over 2 years to actually film this movie because of all the animal training. Really tricky stuff. But well worth it. My 2 year old niece cried when watching it and thought they were being mean to the poor animals, but then she watched it again and loved it. So, yes, I still recommend this to very yound children, especially if they love animals.",5,A long time favorite,1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,618,"['saw', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'young', 'very', 'recently', 'picked', 'up', 'dvd', '5', 'bucks', 'just', 'had', 'havent', 'seen', 'forever', 'still', 'remember', 'loving', 'really', 'cute', 'sincere', 'cant', 'help', 'smile', 'know', 'did', 'research', 'read', 'took', 'over', '2', 'years', 'actually', 'film', 'movie', 'animal', 'training', 'Really', 'tricky', 'stuff', 'well', '2', 'year', 'old', 'niece', 'cried', 'when', 'watching', 'thought', 'were', 'being', 'mean', 'poor', 'animals', 'then', 'watched', 'again', 'loved', 'So', 'yes', 'still', 'recommend', 'very', 'yound', 'children', 'especially', 'love', 'animals']",N/A

See, in real life staged films usually require MULTIPLE takes to ""get the shot right""; perhaps the angles aren't good enough to use, whatever. All throughout, I kept wondering what horrors the crew was doing behind the camera to get the animals to do what they wanted. If you were utterly naive about the ways of the world and viewed this picture with innocent eyes you might find it cute, after all you have dainty music, deceptive editing, and the charming narration of Dudley Moore. That is the magic of post-production. I'm no animal rights fascist, but this is beyond the pale. Misery is so clear and evident upon the faces of the dog and cat.

I have to give them credit for the narration, instead of having the animals ACTUALLY talking (like in other films).  It adds more to the realism, and seems more like a story being told.  But anyway, it's fun to see the animals go their ways and make friends.
