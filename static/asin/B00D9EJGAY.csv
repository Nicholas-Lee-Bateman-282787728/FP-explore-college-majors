1654518,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00D9EJGAY,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[8, 9]","After watching several horror movies in a row, I was looking forward to jumping into a good sci-fi flick. I slipped Image Entertainment's ""Scavengers"" into my Blu-ray player and settled in for some entertaining space dog fights and laser gun battles. An hour and a half later, I was left still wanting to witness these elements.While traveling the farthest corners of space in the starship Revelator, a group of scavengers discover an alien artifact with mysterious powers. A gang of rival mercenaries pursue the Revelator and its crew in an attempt to steal the object and use it as a weapon. After witnessing the deadly force of the artifact, the scavengers realize the importance of keeping it out of the wrong hands.""Scavengers"" isn't devoid of any action. There are a few moments of excitement spread throughout the movie. Not enough to save it from long stretches of boring dialogue and bad delivery from one actor in particular who should know better. Sean Patrick Flanery chews up the scenery here by playing a space pirate of sorts who strangely has a rural Louisiana Cajun accent. It's highly awkward, distracting, and, at times, just plain silly.I will give Director Travis Zariwny credit for taking the action outside of a starship or station and out into actual space. Many independent sci-fi films take place in one location. Most of them include a crew chasing and being chased through hallways and corridors by aliens, creatures, or robots. Zariwny gives us exterior shots of ships flying while fighting and blowing each other up. The CGI isn't spectacular by any means, but it's adequate for ""Scavengers.""Although it's not rated, ""Scavengers"" would earn an R in my opinion. It features sci-fi violence, gore, language, adult situations, and nudity. The scene of nudity was completely unnecessary and will no doubt keep certain viewers from watching it, which could make or break a small independent science fiction film like this.""Scavengers"" is trying to be a complex and heady sci-fi film, but its subject matter really doesn't support such attempts. It's much too talky for the majority of viewers who are going to pick this up. Audiences are expecting more than five or ten minutes of serious action when they see the cover of a DVD with spaceships shooting at each other and a guy staring out at the battle while holding a laser rifle.",2,"Talky Sci-Fi ""Scavengers"" Has Too Much to Say and Little to Do",1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,2357,"['watching', 'several', 'horror', 'movies', 'row', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'jumping', 'good', 'sci-fi', 'flick', 'slipped', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'Scavengers', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'settled', 'entertaining', 'space', 'dog', 'fights', 'laser', 'gun', 'battles', 'hour', 'half', 'later', 'was', 'left', 'still', 'wanting', 'witness', 'traveling', 'farthest', 'corners', 'space', 'starship', 'Revelator', 'group', 'scavengers', 'discover', 'alien', 'artifact', 'mysterious', 'powers', 'gang', 'rival', 'mercenaries', 'pursue', 'Revelator', 'crew', 'attempt', 'steal', 'object', 'use', 'weapon', 'witnessing', 'deadly', 'force', 'artifact', 'scavengers', 'realize', 'importance', 'keeping', 'wrong', 'hands', 'Scavengers', ""n't"", 'devoid', 'action', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'excitement', 'spread', 'movie', 'Not', 'enough', 'save', 'long', 'stretches', 'boring', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'delivery', 'one', 'actor', 'particular', 'who', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'Sean', 'Patrick', 'Flanery', 'up', 'scenery', 'here', 'playing', 'space', 'pirate', 'sorts', 'who', 'strangely', 'rural', 'Louisiana', 'Cajun', 'accent', 'highly', 'awkward', 'distracting', 'times', 'just', 'plain', 'silly.I', 'will', 'give', 'Director', 'Travis', 'Zariwny', 'credit', 'taking', 'action', 'starship', 'station', 'actual', 'space', 'Many', 'independent', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'take', 'place', 'one', 'location', 'Most', 'include', 'crew', 'chasing', 'being', 'chased', 'hallways', 'corridors', 'aliens', 'creatures', 'robots', 'Zariwny', 'exterior', 'shots', 'ships', 'flying', 'fighting', 'blowing', 'other', 'up', 'CGI', ""n't"", 'spectacular', 'means', 'adequate', 'Scavengers', 'not', 'rated', 'Scavengers', 'would', 'earn', 'R', 'opinion', 'sci-fi', 'violence', 'gore', 'language', 'adult', 'situations', 'nudity', 'scene', 'nudity', 'was', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'will', 'doubt', 'keep', 'certain', 'viewers', 'watching', 'could', 'make', 'break', 'small', 'independent', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'Scavengers', 'trying', 'be', 'complex', 'heady', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'really', ""n't"", 'support', 'such', 'attempts', 'much', 'too', 'talky', 'majority', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'pick', 'up', 'Audiences', 'are', 'expecting', 'more', 'five', 'ten', 'minutes', 'serious', 'action', 'when', 'see', 'cover', 'DVD', 'spaceships', 'shooting', 'other', 'guy', 'staring', 'out', 'battle', 'holding', 'laser', 'rifle']",N/A

1654524,A1PLVSI37Y3YFM,B00D9EJGAY,William D Wolford,"[1, 2]","I've never had the displeasure of seeing someone ruin a movie all by themselves. Granted, he had lots of help, but Scavengers could have been a better movie had Sean Patrick Flanery (Playing bad guy Jekel)  simply refused the part. His voice barely rises above a snarly whisper most of the time, and when you can understand what he's saying you wish that you couldn't. I couldn't quite tell if it was a horrible script that couldn't be saved, or if he actually thought he was menacing. Point is, none of that matters because he sucked, and was totally annoying and unbelievable.Scavengers is a sci-fi film that would probably find a nice home on the Syfy network. The plot is about two bitter enemies chasing one another for the three parts of a ""chaos"" machine hidden across the universe. While we have some characters here that do their job fairly well (John Lee Ames, Jamie Strange & Louise Linton), the horrible special effects ruin the story and get in the way of making the movie something you can get into at all. Every time I'd start to settle in to a part of the film, something would come up to wreck it. Machine gun fire sounds from spacecraft? Yes, you have it here. Special Effects that make the Saturday Morning Cartoons look like Star Wars? Yes, it's here. This is NOT a so bad it's good movie. This movie has parts and pieces that actually work. There are a few scenes that work very well, but they are far and few between, and not worth spending money to see.I would like to warn you as well. The end of this film has it set up for a sequel if they wanted to do one. I'd advise you to run and not walk away from this if it happened. Characters who have gone through the wringer throughout the films running time are suddenly fresh and ready to roll off into space again just as the credits are about to roll. So it seems to make the whole ninety plus minutes of what you just watched a completely moot point. Could this be a prequel of sorts? Could it be the start of some sort of series? Please no. Spare us that. As I said before, this could have a life as a series on the Syfy Network. Other than that it's doomed to frustrate viewers with it's atrocious acting on the part of Flanery, and it's wooden script.This DVD is being put out by Image Entertainment U.K., which is a new label from RLJ Entertainment. The release date is late January 2014 in the U.K. It is a branch of the Image Entertainment U.S. label.
