Suddenly they are returned to the present.This series works on multiple levels, and that's what makes it work.The future is manipulating the past in order to save the future. To do this, the future has given each of the returnees a special ability or role to play.Governmental responsibility is managed by Homeland Security and all the pitfalls of the Patriot Act are quietly introduced.Then there are the people as they attempt to pick up their lives. In some cases it works and in others, everything has fallen apart during their absence.Where Mulder and Skully (of X-File fame) chased the elusive aliens, this show takes things a step closer to the truth.

856407,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00062IDEW,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 1]","I began this series about a year ago, watched two episodes, then left it behind.  I don't know why, but it just never made it back into my DVD player.  Don't call me scared, because I wasn't, but I just wasn't instantly pulled into the show - now, a year later, I can't stop watching and waiting to see what will happen to those 4400 returnees.  This series, from the USA network, is slow, but not in a bad way.  It takes a while to pull you in, it makes you think, and consider all possibilities of this supposed ""ripple"" effect.  What pulled me back into this series after such a long absence was the lingering thought in my mind of what these individual stories had to do with the bigger picture.  The idea of the ""apocalypse"" seems to be a hot button item right now in pop culture (see the popularity of Cormac's ""The Road"" and NBC's ""Heroes""), and upon watching the finale of this opening season of ""The 4400"", you are hinted towards the idea that these returnees are back for a reason - to big to be explored in the first season, but giving your imagination enough to grow upon for the upcoming seasons.  This show has the potential to be HUGE, and as I begin the next season, I cannot wait to see where the unknown will take us.This beginning season is you typical opening faucet of ideas.  We slowly learn about our characters, their ideas, their problems, and as we progress through the first 2-hour premiere, we see that something big is going to enter their lives.  From the personal, to the impersonal, to the hypothetical, the world as we know it will change with the return of these 4400 initial unknowns that have been missing from a range of 1-60 years.  What makes this series stand out is that it is not just two FBI agents against the world, like ""The X-Files"", but instead we see the pieces come together for all different storylines.  While we are focused on both Baldwin and Diana's stories respectfully, it is the stories of Shawn Farrell's powers, the pregnancy of Lily, and the thoughts of Maia that skillfully blend the drama to the science fiction.  Don't be fooled, this is a science-fiction program, but it uses it mainly as the background to a bigger storyline - the idea of human's trying to cope with a surrounding that didn't really change much over the past 60 years.This is a tough series to review, and I don't know why.  I feel as if I talk too much about what I enjoyed about ""The 4400"", it may give too much away.  It was sequential, meaning that if you do plan on viewing the story, watch it in order, it will expose you to so much more.  The finale is breathtaking, giving you a final image that will last with you until you pick up the next season.  The characters are believable, while still being on the USA network - meaning that the voice could be a bit stronger.  The writing I believe will tighten up over time, while the smaller budget makes for obvious indoor/outdoor mistakes, but they are all forgiven because of the original idea.  This isn't your typical ""Lost"" moments where questions pile up and continue to pile eventually negating themselves within the storyline, these are situations, bounded by solutions, giving us a chance to actually enjoy the premise and the solutions.  Like I said when I started, this show is simple and slow, and typically I would be ranting and raving with anger, but the minds behind ""The 4400"" are genius.  They have used these non-formulaic procedures and created gripping television.  Here is an underexposed show that will obviously become a cult classic over time.Overall, this is a short review because I am jumping headfirst into the next season, which (not to give anything away), I am salivating over.  The new season opens new doors, explains further, and gives us hope.  The secondary stories remain truthful and fun, giving us new faces to the supposed ""ripple effect"" that roots this program.  Personally, I think this is a great program right up there with the best sci-fi programming out there, I am upset that it took me so long to get back into it, but it is definitely a series to enjoy, contemplate, and enjoy again.If you returned with the 4400, what would you see first?Grade: ***** out of *****",5,"If you returned with the 4400, what would you see first?",1179014400,"05 13, 2007",2007,4202,"['began', 'series', 'year', 'ago', 'watched', 'two', 'episodes', 'then', 'left', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'just', 'never', 'made', 'back', 'DVD', 'player', 'Do', ""n't"", 'call', 'scared', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'instantly', 'pulled', 'show', 'now', 'year', 'later', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'waiting', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'happen', '4400', 'returnees', 'series', 'USA', 'network', 'slow', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'while', 'pull', 'think', 'consider', 'possibilities', 'supposed', 'ripple', 'effect', 'What', 'pulled', 'back', 'series', 'such', 'long', 'absence', 'was', 'lingering', 'thought', 'mind', 'what', 'individual', 'stories', 'had', 'do', 'bigger', 'picture', 'idea', 'apocalypse', 'be', 'hot', 'button', 'item', 'right', 'now', 'pop', 'culture', 'see', 'popularity', 'Cormac', 'Road', 'NBC', 'Heroes', 'watching', 'finale', 'opening', 'season', '4400', 'are', 'hinted', 'idea', 'returnees', 'are', 'back', 'reason', 'big', 'be', 'explored', 'first', 'season', 'giving', 'imagination', 'enough', 'grow', 'upcoming', 'seasons', 'show', 'potential', 'be', 'HUGE', 'begin', 'next', 'season', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'see', 'where', 'unknown', 'will', 'take', 'us.This', 'beginning', 'season', 'typical', 'opening', 'faucet', 'ideas', 'slowly', 'learn', 'characters', 'ideas', 'problems', 'progress', 'first', '2-hour', 'premiere', 'see', 'something', 'big', 'going', 'enter', 'lives', 'personal', 'impersonal', 'hypothetical', 'world', 'know', 'will', 'change', 'return', '4400', 'initial', 'unknowns', 'have', 'been', 'missing', 'range', '1-60', 'years', 'What', 'series', 'stand', 'out', 'not', 'just', 'two', 'FBI', 'agents', 'world', 'X-Files', 'instead', 'see', 'pieces', 'come', 'together', 'different', 'storylines', 'are', 'focused', 'Baldwin', 'Diana', 'stories', 'respectfully', 'stories', 'Shawn', 'Farrell', 'powers', 'pregnancy', 'Lily', 'thoughts', 'Maia', 'skillfully', 'blend', 'drama', 'science', 'fiction', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'science-fiction', 'program', 'mainly', 'background', 'bigger', 'storyline', 'idea', 'human', 'trying', 'cope', 'surrounding', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'change', 'much', 'past', '60', 'years.This', 'tough', 'series', 'review', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'feel', 'talk', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'enjoyed', '4400', 'may', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'was', 'sequential', 'meaning', 'do', 'plan', 'viewing', 'story', 'watch', 'order', 'will', 'expose', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'finale', 'breathtaking', 'giving', 'final', 'image', 'will', 'last', 'pick', 'up', 'next', 'season', 'characters', 'are', 'believable', 'still', 'being', 'USA', 'network', 'meaning', 'voice', 'could', 'be', 'bit', 'stronger', 'writing', 'believe', 'will', 'tighten', 'up', 'time', 'smaller', 'budget', 'obvious', 'indoor/outdoor', 'mistakes', 'are', 'forgiven', 'original', 'idea', ""n't"", 'typical', 'Lost', 'moments', 'where', 'questions', 'pile', 'up', 'continue', 'pile', 'eventually', 'negating', 'storyline', 'are', 'situations', 'bounded', 'solutions', 'giving', 'chance', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'premise', 'solutions', 'said', 'when', 'started', 'show', 'simple', 'slow', 'typically', 'would', 'be', 'ranting', 'raving', 'anger', 'minds', '4400', 'are', 'genius', 'have', 'used', 'non-formulaic', 'procedures', 'created', 'gripping', 'television', 'Here', 'underexposed', 'show', 'will', 'obviously', 'become', 'cult', 'classic', 'time.Overall', 'short', 'review', 'am', 'jumping', 'headfirst', 'next', 'season', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'am', 'salivating', 'new', 'season', 'new', 'doors', 'further', 'hope', 'secondary', 'stories', 'remain', 'truthful', 'fun', 'giving', 'new', 'supposed', 'ripple', 'effect', 'roots', 'program', 'Personally', 'think', 'great', 'program', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'programming', 'there', 'am', 'upset', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'back', 'definitely', 'series', 'enjoy', 'contemplate', 'enjoy', 'again.If', 'returned', '4400', 'what', 'would', 'see', 'first', 'Grade', '*****', '*****']",The 4400 - The Complete First Season

Don't let the sci-fi/X-files slant deter you from watching this series because it is so much more.  It's part police procedural, part family drama, part sci-fi, and the mix of elements is perfect.

856410,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00062IDEW,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 5]","A comet is headed toward Earth and appears to be on a collision course. The world's governments launch all of their nuclear arsenals at it, hoping that the explosions might divert it. But they don't. The comet continues toward our little blue planet and, as it approaches, suddenly slows and changes direction. Do comets do that?This outer-space ball of light comes in for a landing near Mount Ranier in Washington and quickly deposits 4400 people (humans) onto the ground. Then the ball of light vanishes. But the people it left behind remain. Who are they?They turn out to be the 4400 people who've been abducted over the past 60 years or so. By aliens? A higher power? We're not sure. What is evident, however, is that none of them have aged a second beyond their initial abduction date, and none have any memory of where they were.Initially, all of the returnees are kept in a lock-down facility run by the Agency for Homeland Security. Peter Coyote plays the boss of Seattle's Homeland Security office and is bombarded with problems. The media want to know who all of the returnees are. Many people fear them, believing the 4400 to be virus vectors or ticking time-bombs. But none of this comes to pass, and the ACLU gets involved and aids in the returnees release.Soon after their release, little clues about what has happened to the 4400 slowly emerge. One of them, a little girl named Maia (is it a coincidence that her name is very close to Gaia?), has clairvoyant abilities. Another possess the ability to control life and death with the touch of his hands. While others have incredible reflexes or are pregnant and weren't before the abduction.Prejudices against the 4400 soon break out. People fear these ""different"" humans. Bombs begin to explode around the 4400. Death threats come in. Have we humans not learned anything from our past? Native Americans. Black Slaves. Religious variations. These also have led to fear of ""the different"" and subsequent abuses.******************************************************************************The series' premise is good but the execution a bit flawed. From the very first episode I began noticing errors or convenient inconsistencies. For instance, when the world launches their nuclear weapons at what they thought was a comet, the weapons reach the comet in a few minutes, even though it hasn't passed by the moon yet. Uh ...I don't think so. It'd take days or weeks for that to happen.The world's people were abducted (not just America's), but we see little to no commentary about this. The only mention of it was during the first episode which said that ""most countries don't want to repatriate their abductees."" So if that was the case, where are these foreign soil returnees and how are they adjusting not only to being returned, but returned to a foreign country?Even with these flaws, however, I found the first season engaging enough to continue watching. The acting is excellent and the special effects are okay (contrary to what others have posted here, saying things like ""cheesy"", etc. about them.)There are also so many story lines to follow that I could see this series (like LOST) continuing on for many seasons. If a viewer became bored with one or two abductees' stories, all they need to do is keep on watching and the next episode is bound to add another.",3,"""The Different"" People of the Light",1126742400,"09 15, 2005",2005,3335,"['comet', 'headed', 'Earth', 'be', 'collision', 'course', 'world', 'governments', 'launch', 'nuclear', 'arsenals', 'hoping', 'explosions', 'might', 'divert', 'do', ""n't"", 'comet', 'little', 'blue', 'planet', 'suddenly', 'changes', 'direction', 'Do', 'comets', 'do', 'outer-space', 'ball', 'light', 'landing', 'Mount', 'Ranier', 'Washington', 'quickly', 'deposits', '4400', 'people', 'humans', 'ground', 'Then', 'ball', 'light', 'vanishes', 'people', 'left', 'behind', 'remain', 'Who', 'are', 'turn', 'out', 'be', '4400', 'people', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'abducted', 'past', '60', 'years', 'so', 'aliens', 'higher', 'power', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'What', 'evident', 'however', 'none', 'have', 'aged', 'second', 'initial', 'abduction', 'date', 'none', 'have', 'memory', 'where', 'were.Initially', 'returnees', 'are', 'kept', 'lock-down', 'facility', 'run', 'Agency', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'boss', 'Seattle', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'office', 'bombarded', 'problems', 'media', 'want', 'know', 'who', 'returnees', 'are', 'Many', 'people', 'fear', 'believing', '4400', 'be', 'virus', 'vectors', 'ticking', 'time-bombs', 'none', 'pass', 'ACLU', 'involved', 'aids', 'returnees', 'release.Soon', 'release', 'little', 'clues', 'what', 'happened', '4400', 'slowly', 'emerge', 'One', 'little', 'girl', 'named', 'Maia', 'coincidence', 'name', 'very', 'close', 'Gaia', 'clairvoyant', 'abilities', 'possess', 'ability', 'control', 'life', 'death', 'touch', 'hands', 'others', 'have', 'incredible', 'reflexes', 'are', 'pregnant', 'were', ""n't"", 'abduction.Prejudices', '4400', 'soon', 'break', 'out', 'People', 'fear', 'different', 'humans', 'Bombs', 'begin', 'explode', '4400', 'Death', 'threats', 'come', 'Have', 'humans', 'not', 'learned', 'anything', 'past', 'Native', 'Americans', 'Black', 'Slaves', 'Religious', 'variations', 'also', 'have', 'led', 'fear', 'different', 'subsequent', 'abuses', '******************************************************************************The', 'series', 'premise', 'good', 'execution', 'bit', 'flawed', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'began', 'noticing', 'errors', 'convenient', 'inconsistencies', 'instance', 'when', 'world', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'comet', 'weapons', 'reach', 'comet', 'few', 'minutes', 'even', ""n't"", 'passed', 'moon', 'yet', 'Uh', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', ""'d"", 'take', 'days', 'weeks', 'happen.The', 'world', 'people', 'were', 'abducted', 'not', 'just', 'America', 'see', 'little', 'commentary', 'only', 'mention', 'was', 'first', 'episode', 'said', 'most', 'countries', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'repatriate', 'abductees', 'So', 'was', 'case', 'where', 'are', 'foreign', 'soil', 'returnees', 'how', 'are', 'adjusting', 'not', 'only', 'being', 'returned', 'returned', 'foreign', 'country', 'Even', 'flaws', 'however', 'found', 'first', 'season', 'engaging', 'enough', 'continue', 'watching', 'acting', 'excellent', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'okay', 'contrary', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'posted', 'here', 'saying', 'things', 'cheesy', 'etc', 'are', 'also', 'so', 'many', 'story', 'lines', 'follow', 'could', 'see', 'series', 'LOST', 'continuing', 'many', 'seasons', 'viewer', 'became', 'bored', 'one', 'two', 'abductees', 'stories', 'need', 'do', 'keep', 'watching', 'next', 'episode', 'bound', 'add']",The 4400 - The Complete First Season

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","TV goes in cycles -- and a few years ago, there were a lot of creepy-suspenseful shows full of strange supernatural/superhuman occurrances, sort of crosses between ""X-Files"" and ""Lost."" But before those shows came out, there was the most underrated one: ""The 4400,"" a suspenseful, intelligent show that looks not at mysterious abductions -- but mysterious returns.1946: A little girl vanishes in the woods. 1951: A black GI vanishes from a tent. 1979: A corporate head vanishes from his car. 2001: A teenager vanishes from a camping trip, leaving his cousin in a coma. In 2004, a comet is on a collision course with Earth, causing widespread panic. But instead of crashing, it hovers over a Seattle lake -- and leaves 4400 bewildered people around the lakeside.These people all vanished over the past sixty years, and have been returned without any aging, and with no memory of what happened to them in the time they were gone. Tom Baldwin (Joel Gretsch), whose son is the one in a coma, is desperate to find out what did happen, so he rejoins Homeland Security to keep tabs on the ""4400,"" as they are now known.Some like his nephew Shawn (Patrick Flueger) return to their old lives, only to find that they are reviled. And some like ex-GI Richard (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) and his girlfriend's granddaughter Lily (Laura Allen) find that they have no lives to return to. Ostracized and threatened, they start to draw together. But the strangest thing is that the 4400 are starting to show signs of X-Men-like powers: super speed, clairvoyance, telekinesis, healing, and mind control.Tom and his HS partner Diana Skouros (Jacqueline McKenzie) track down both rogue abductees, and try to prevent harm from coming to the innocent 4400s. But when Shawn heals Tom's son Kyle (Chad Faust), Kyle comes back changed -- and his strange behavior holds the key to the 4400's purpose on Earth.Okay, the complete first season of ""4400"" is only five episodes long, making it about the length of a miniseries. But unlike most shows on TV, its writers cram a whole season's worth of plot into only six hours. In most movies and shows, people who vanish and then are returned are always welcomed back. This time, they are treated with suspicion and even hatred, and many are completely alone.There are standalone ""4400 of the week"" stories, like the one about a 4400 serial killer, or a vigilante who is using his powers. But there are also intertwining plots about how the 4400s try to survive in a new world that fears them. We see Shawn trying to fit back into high school, and Richard and Lily finding that they have no homes left, and building a home together.And the final episode is absolutely mind-blowing, with sudden shifts in Homeland Security's power, a sinister megamogul, and Tom desperately trying to save his son. While the mystery of the 4400s is partly solved, there are lots of questions left over for the recently released second season. It's satisfying, but will leave you wanting more.The acting is kind of stiff in the first episode or two, but when the actors settle into their roles they do a solid job. Gretsch and McKenzie have good-cop/bad-cop chemistry, and they do a good job playing off each other's personalities. Flueger soon does a good job as a a tormented teenager, and Ali is nothing short of brilliant with his confused, bittersweet Richard. The one real problem is Conchita Campbell, who spends most of the season playing the Smiling Little Kid Who Makes Creepy Pronouncements.""The 4400"" produced a rather peculiar brand of paranormal show, with a new spin on the typical ""abducted by aliens"" plot.

Ward ""horror and sci-fi fan..""","[0, 0]","the 4400 series began around the same time the X-Files series ended, and became, to me, the heir apparent in terms of quality sci-fi on television.  You have a male-female partnership (like the X-Files); you have unexplained sci-fi stories that they investigate (like the X-Files).  The show is even filmed in the Vancouver, Canada area, (like the X-Files). The comparisons end there.  Everything else about the two shows is quite different- from the overall tone of the show, to the acting, the chemistry between all the actors.  Any yet, the 4400 (like the X-Files) serves up quality and interesting sci-fi stories episode after episode.  To me, it's like the 4400 is the kid brother to the X-Files' older brother.What I enjoy best about the 4400 are the two lead actors- good chemistry between them; they really carry the show along, because even with all the bells and whistles, it's really a show about 2 people investigating crimes.  You (the viewer) need to care about how these crimes affect the 2 main characters in order to stay interested, and the show is outstanding in this respect.  The series is more character driven than your typical space-setting sci-fi.  It really has to be, since all the action takes place on earth.Enjoy the show..",4,good- very good,1208217600,"04 15, 2008",2008,1253,"['4400', 'series', 'began', 'same', 'time', 'X-Files', 'series', 'ended', 'became', 'heir', 'apparent', 'terms', 'quality', 'sci-fi', 'television', 'have', 'male-female', 'partnership', 'X-Files', 'have', 'unexplained', 'sci-fi', 'stories', 'investigate', 'X-Files', 'show', 'even', 'filmed', 'Vancouver', 'Canada', 'area', 'X-Files', 'comparisons', 'end', 'there', 'Everything', 'else', 'two', 'shows', 'quite', 'different-', 'overall', 'tone', 'show', 'acting', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'yet', '4400', 'X-Files', 'up', 'quality', 'interesting', 'sci-fi', 'stories', 'episode', 'episode', '4400', 'kid', 'brother', 'X-Files', 'older', 'enjoy', 'best', '4400', 'are', 'two', 'lead', 'actors-', 'good', 'chemistry', 'really', 'carry', 'show', 'along', 'even', 'bells', 'whistles', 'really', 'show', '2', 'people', 'investigating', 'crimes', 'viewer', 'need', 'care', 'how', 'crimes', 'affect', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'order', 'stay', 'interested', 'show', 'outstanding', 'respect', 'series', 'more', 'character', 'driven', 'typical', 'space-setting', 'sci-fi', 'really', 'be', 'action', 'place', 'earth.Enjoy', 'show..']",The 4400 - The Complete First Season

Most of it is terrible, brainless, pointless, worthless, and a whole other list of -lesses.I was given a brief synopsis of this show from a friend of mine and decided to order the DVD's and give the show a shot hoping that I might have a show I could be interested in.And in the end, yes, this is a show worth watching.  All the characters are real and well developed.  Best of all, there is a riveting and intriguing plot that keeps you wanting to catch the next episode.  Many reviewers comment that it reminds them a lot of the X-Files but I think it more closely resemblesSteven Spielberg's ""Taken.""The first season was given five episodes to prove itself and was later approved for a second season.  These five episodes introduce with a very big question regarding the 4400.  A lot of the questions are answered by the end of the season, but many more questions arise to make way for an excellent second season.The five episodes are:1. The Pilot.  This is a 2 hour episode (much less minus the commercials).  The first half sets up the story and introduces you to most of the main characters as the 4,400 abductees are returned to earth in what appears to be a large, bright comet.  The department of homeland security takes the abductees and Agents Tom Baldwin and Diana Skouris are assigned to the task of finding the answers to the 4400.  After the 4400 are let go the second half of the show follows one of the abductees, Orson Bailey who appears to have developed newly found special abilities.2. The New & Improved Carl Morrissey. Carl Morrissey has returned home to not only find that his neighborhood has changed, but so has he.  He attempts to fix what has gone wrong in the neighborhood with his new-found special powers.3. Becoming:  Jordan Collier makes his initial appearance in this episode.  He is a wealthy abductee who heads a large company and uses his power and assets to start bringing the 4400 together.  His true motives have not revealed but it does add to the overall plot of the story.  Also, a serial killer appears to be one of the 4400 and has returned to his old habits.  Unfortunately, he has new tricks up his sleeves that leaves everybody baffled on how it happens.4. Trial By Fire.  When the 4400 names are posted on the Internet a small group of people start killing them off.  Jordan is still gathering the 4400 into his group.5. White Light: Many of the questions are finally answered in this episode.  Specifically, what happened to Kyle, Agent Baldwin's son and what happened to the 4400 to begin with.  Also, one of the abductees is having a baby, and it appears that this baby holds a lot more answers to the reason the 4400 are returned.  Finally, the motives of Jordan Collier seem to not be as altruistic as it appears in his interest with the 4400.All in all, if you like sci-fi, fantasy, or anything with a good story line then I highly recommend this show.  This show actually has me interested in television again as I'm watching the 4400 marathon on USA while typing this review.

856431,A3Q65632Z2K95F,B00062IDEW,James Goodwin,"[1, 1]","You needn't be a fan of science fiction to enjoy 'The 4400', because this remarkable beginning is, first and foremost, a story about people -- trying to reconnect with a life interrupted, as the saying goes.Of course, it's centered not just around the titular players -- a group of individuals who've been abducted throughout history, and returned at present with, in some cases, supernatural powers -- but also follows two federal agents, Tom and Diana, who investigate all suspicious matters regarding the returnees. As the mystery unfolds, a smartly written, unexpected story is revealed, given heart by the very likable cast of characters who've been affected by it.Naturally, in any tale involving more than a few people with mystical abilities, sooner or later a few troublemakers begin turning up -- powered or not -- and the well-constructed plot makes great use of ambition and reaction to serve up a highly entertaining story.There are a few bonds throughout this season that one will become more and more drawn to, including the growing friendship between Richard and Lily, the humorously difficult connection between Tom and Diana, and the romance between Shawn and Nikki. But the most touching matter in this regard is probably the ingenious relationship between Diana and Maia -- a calm and collected little girl from the 1940s who, like the other returnees, has been sent back the same age as when she was taken. Growing lonely under government care, Maia is eventually taken in by a reluctant Diana, and from there the show develops a very interesting bond between the two as they become subtly closer. (Unfortunately, Season 2 removes the intrigue of this relationship by making them a bit too close -- to the point where things feel overbearing and typical).This season is so well done that if it had been edited into three hours' worth of material and put in theaters, people would call it an extraordinary film.

I just got into it recently and now just decided to watch it from the beginning. The 3rd season isn't bad but I really missed some great tv by not watching it from the start. 4400 people disapear and reapear after a big ball of light appears in the sky. They all come back to their lives being different, their loved ones are either dead, moved on or just treat them differently. So they have to find their place in the world. On top of that they slowly realize that they have new abilities.Two agents, must work together to find out the secrets of the 4400. One Tom Baldwin volunteers to be on the case because he knows it will lead him to find out why his son is in a mysterious coma. While his nephew Shawn disapeared the same night his son was put in a coma. Now he's back and part of the 4400. Shawn soon finds that he can heal people and also finds that his brother's g/f  has a crush on him. As if his brother doesn't treat him strange after his reapearance already.While Conchita Campbell is adorable yet creepy as a child 4400 that was missing the longest. She can tell the future and even knows that things won't last very long with her new foster parents. Especially when she tells the husband what cemetary he'll be buried in. Bill Campbell (The Rocketeer, Enough) plays a rich and powerful man that decides to be the voice of the 4400 claiming that he too is one. He influences the others to realize that they are important and should embrace their new powers.Their was so many new sci-fi shows last season like Invasion and Surface and I thought they were trying to be like Lost but really they were trying to be like the 4400. Now NBC has Heroes coming out with people all over the world finding out that they have powers. Sound original ? Plus I doubt that will be as good or as fascinating as this.

What follows is a sequence of cliches, predictable occurrances and love stories. If you enjoy watching soap operas, it's a great show. Full of teens in love, husbands and wifes not getting along, people falling in love. - ""Oh, I burned my hand"" , says the girl. ""Let me see it"", says the boy holding her hand. The boy holding her hand has supernatural powers. He heals the wound caused by the heat and they kiss. - A beautfiful moment if you enjoy soap operas as I said. But it was enough for me to turn off the TV and go to sleep. If you want to do something that stupid, don't do it using sci-fi as a source of inspiration for the show. Just do another series like Dawson's Creek or the like. I'm sure the ratings would  be higher because there wouldn't be people who REALLY like science fiction complaining about the lack of intelligence and good sense in the show. Besides that, there is this group of people that think that every TV show that features a flying soucer is science fiction. They call me and ask, ""Have you seen this new sci-fi show, the 4400 ?"". I have to spend hours explaining them that MILLENIUM, THE X FILES, PLANETE OF THE APES, are totally different from it(because they think they are all science fiction thus they are the same). This is the group that I call ""THE MIXERS"" because they mix things up. If the 4400 hadn't featured that gigantic BLUE BALL, at least you would have saved me the trouble of having to explain these people that there is a difference between good fiction (which seems real) and bad fiction (which things are predicatble, like in soap operas). I still think you can straight things out. Go back to TV and give it another shot. Here's a tip : little by little, you start to forget that they came back from the sky and have powers. As time goes by, this sci-fi thing begins to fade away. Believe me, the audience will not notice it. So by the end of the season, you already have a show in the style of love and teens stories. I'm sure it will definately catch on.

The complications, however, have only just begun...Joel Gretsch, Jacqueline McKenzie, and the rest of this extraordinary cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.  Moreover, The 4400 does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.The only (minor) setbacks are in relation to:1) Not using the wonderful music from the pilot in the other episodes.2) Tom Baldwin's annoying wife.On the positive side:1) The GREAT plot and concept.2) The GREAT characters.3) The GREAT acting.4) In the episode titled Trial By Fire, The 4400 sheds light on the ""new"" Dept of Homeland Security and how they operate (e.g. ""You are being arrested as a terrorist.You are being treated as an enemy combatant.  You do NOT have the right to remain silent..."" etc)5) The wonderful feeling of being addicted to the show and wanting more!In short, The 4400 is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!

856445,A2YWEG35UMPBJ3,B00062IDEW,"L. Harris ""skytag""","[1, 3]","Let me start out by saying that this is the only ""season"" I've ever seen (five episodes hardly constitutes a season in my book), so maybe it comes into its own in the second season and does better than what I saw here.*** SPOILERS ***I got the first clue that the writers for this show are lazy in the pilot before the 4400 people ever showed up. An object people think is a comet is hurtling toward Earth at 3000km/second. We launch Titan II missiles at it. We watch their trails streak through the sky for 55 seconds until they detonate on the object. Twenty-five seconds later we see the object pass the moon on the way to Earth.  Now, what's wrong with this picture?- The last Titan II ICBM (the ones with bombs in them ;-) was deactivated in 1987.  The Titan II SLV was later used as a medium-lift space launch vehicle to launch satellites into orbit.- The Titan II had a range of 8850 km as an intercontinental missle, and most of that occurred after the engines stopped burrning. If the ball of light was traveling at 3000 km/second and took 25 seconds to get to the moon after the missile impacts, that means they hit it 75,000 km on the other side of the moon, or about 450,000 km from Earth. That's 51 times the actual range of a Titan II.- The missiles would have to travel at more than 8000 km/second to cover that kind of distance in the time allotted. The distance from New York City to Moscow is about 8500 km. When did we (or anyone) ever have an ICBM that could reach Moscow in under two seconds? In point of fact, the speed of a Titan II was 15,000/hr, or 6.7 km/second.I'm not a missle expert. I don't quibble with minor inaccuracies. But the notion that we'd launch missles at something on the other side of the moon and watch them hit in less than a minute was so glaringly absurd I went to Wikipedia and read about the Titan II. Now I can quantify just how absurd it was.So apparently the writer figured we should shoot at it, had heard of some missile called the ""Titan II"" and decided to add an attempt to blow it up to the story without any regard for facts or believability. Yes, I know this is science fiction, but even in fiction the fictional parts need to be interwoven with reality to make the overall story believable.On another front, this feels like a soap opera too much of the time for my tastes. When Kyle tells his uncle that he can't remember anything about the night he was abducted, Tom tells him ""Don't lie to me"" even though *none* of the abductees can remember anything about their abductions. Lily's husband doesn't even show up when the 4400 are released from quarantine. When she goes to see him, he tells her he remarried, lied to their daughter about who her real mom is, and takes out a restraining order against her, which he can apparently do because he's a lawyer and knows ""how to work the system."" Soap operas are full of jerks like these guys, which is probably a big reason soap operas annoy me.I could go on, but I'll just say that while the concept is interesting and has some real potential (that might be realized in later seasons), I felt the execution was crippled by weak writing.The casting is fair, but not impressive. Jacqueline McKenzie is about the only person I'd miss if they replaced her with someone else.All in all it was interesting, but it didn't leave me wanting to see the second season.",3,Disappointing,1183507200,"07 4, 2007",2007,3365,"['Let', 'start', 'out', 'saying', 'only', 'season', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'five', 'episodes', 'hardly', 'season', 'book', 'so', 'maybe', 'own', 'second', 'season', 'better', 'what', 'saw', 'here', '***', 'SPOILERS', '***I', 'got', 'first', 'clue', 'writers', 'show', 'are', 'lazy', 'pilot', '4400', 'people', 'ever', 'showed', 'up', 'object', 'people', 'think', 'comet', 'hurtling', 'Earth', '3000km/second', 'launch', 'Titan', 'II', 'missiles', 'watch', 'trails', 'streak', 'sky', '55', 'seconds', 'detonate', 'object', 'Twenty-five', 'seconds', 'later', 'see', 'object', 'pass', 'moon', 'way', 'Earth', 'Now', 'what', 'wrong', 'picture', 'last', 'Titan', 'II', 'ICBM', 'ones', 'bombs', 'was', 'deactivated', '1987', 'Titan', 'II', 'SLV', 'was', 'later', 'used', 'medium-lift', 'space', 'launch', 'vehicle', 'launch', 'satellites', 'orbit.-', 'Titan', 'II', 'had', 'range', '8850', 'km', 'intercontinental', 'missle', 'most', 'occurred', 'engines', 'stopped', 'burrning', 'ball', 'light', 'was', 'traveling', '3000', 'km/second', 'took', '25', 'seconds', 'get', 'moon', 'missile', 'impacts', 'hit', '75,000', 'km', 'other', 'side', 'moon', '450,000', 'km', 'Earth', '51', 'times', 'actual', 'range', 'Titan', 'II.-', 'missiles', 'would', 'have', 'travel', 'more', '8000', 'km/second', 'cover', 'kind', 'distance', 'time', 'allotted', 'distance', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Moscow', '8500', 'km', 'When', 'did', 'anyone', 'ever', 'have', 'ICBM', 'could', 'reach', 'Moscow', 'two', 'seconds', 'point', 'fact', 'speed', 'Titan', 'II', 'was', '15,000/hr', '6.7', 'km/second.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'missle', 'expert', 'do', ""n't"", 'quibble', 'minor', 'inaccuracies', 'notion', ""'d"", 'launch', 'missles', 'something', 'other', 'side', 'moon', 'watch', 'hit', 'less', 'minute', 'was', 'so', 'glaringly', 'absurd', 'went', 'Wikipedia', 'read', 'Titan', 'II', 'Now', 'can', 'quantify', 'just', 'how', 'absurd', 'apparently', 'writer', 'figured', 'should', 'shoot', 'had', 'heard', 'missile', 'called', 'Titan', 'II', 'decided', 'add', 'attempt', 'blow', 'up', 'story', 'regard', 'facts', 'believability', 'Yes', 'know', 'science', 'fiction', 'even', 'fiction', 'fictional', 'parts', 'need', 'be', 'interwoven', 'reality', 'make', 'overall', 'story', 'believable.On', 'front', 'feels', 'soap', 'opera', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'tastes', 'When', 'Kyle', 'uncle', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'anything', 'night', 'was', 'abducted', 'Tom', 'Do', ""n't"", 'lie', 'even', '*none*', 'abductees', 'can', 'remember', 'anything', 'abductions', 'Lily', 'husband', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'up', 'when', '4400', 'are', 'released', 'quarantine', 'When', 'see', 'remarried', 'lied', 'daughter', 'who', 'real', 'mom', 'out', 'restraining', 'order', 'can', 'apparently', 'do', 'lawyer', 'how', 'work', 'system', 'Soap', 'operas', 'are', 'full', 'jerks', 'guys', 'probably', 'big', 'reason', 'soap', 'operas', 'annoy', 'me.I', 'could', 'go', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'concept', 'interesting', 'real', 'potential', 'might', 'be', 'realized', 'later', 'seasons', 'felt', 'execution', 'was', 'crippled', 'weak', 'writing.The', 'casting', 'fair', 'not', 'impressive', 'Jacqueline', 'McKenzie', 'only', 'person', ""'d"", 'miss', 'replaced', 'someone', 'else.All', 'was', 'interesting', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'wanting', 'see', 'second', 'season']",The 4400 - The Complete First Season

The ""Nasa"" like agency launce missiles at the object but then it doesn't seem to slow down until they realize that the drop point would be at there own back yard.Everyone races outside to see what they can not seem to stop, but are shocked to see a large white ball of light hovering above the lake and then exploding out with such force that knocked everyone down. This is where all the chaos starts to break out and there the start of the story beings. The return of all 4400 people who went missing throughout the years without any explanation.Chapter 1:  The ReturnThis is basically the same summary as above, but then to add to it, everyone was sent to quarantine. And two agents Tom and Diana are assigned to the case to find out what the heck is going on. And at the same time Tom's son is in coma, and he wants to find answers from the only person who saw him last 3 years ago, his nephew.

Carl Morrissey one of the 4400 goes back to trying to gain back his life that he has disappeared form find out a lot has changed. Changed so much that he finds out that he lost his firm, as well as visited his wife to see that she has aged so much that she is hardly ""all there."" This is where the first of the ""powers"" of the 4400 comes out. When the son of his long time partner in the firm doesn't want to give back the firm to the original owner, Carl, it enraged and tries to do something about it.Chapter 3: BecomingJust when you thought you caught the killer so long ago, he mysteriously appears again just when the 4400 return? That sounds pretty suspicious to Tom and Diana when they were sent to investigate the case. Just when they narrowed it down, they were being lead around in circles as the person who they tracked down confesses to the murder, suddenly another one shows up and confesses as well?Chapter 4: Trial by FireThis is where a lot of things start to happen. Kyle, Tom's son wakes up from coma, people are making bombs to kill off the 4400 one by one. And Jordan, a rich real estater devotes his time and money in making a community for the 4400 where the first customers were Lily and Richard, and maia, the girl with the mysteriously strange powers to see the future becomes part of Diana's life.Chapter 5: White LightKyle is taken from the hospital from Tom and his soon to be Ex-Wife with no good reason from Home Land Security.

856463,ARMVAHWQQ9S8A,B00062IDEW,"Pat Shand ""Pat Shand""","[0, 0]","At this point in the series, ""The 4400"" isn't a great show.  It's a good show that, for the most part, will keep you entertained.  It's a quick season, so the overall story arc gets handled nicely.  It's a very intimate show, and the character's are introduced quickly and skillfully, but there are a few things lacking in the overall package that really prevent it from being at the same level as other sci-fi mysteries likeLostandBattlestar Galactica.  I'll break the show up into a list of positives and negatives.POSITIVES+ The ""mystery of the week"" sections of the episodes are a lot stronger than the overall arc of the season.  Each episode told a good standalone story, and that is the driving force behind this being a good show.+ A lot of the guest stars are very, very impressive.  Especially David Eigenberg is episode two as Carl Morrisey.+ The characters are interesting, for the most part.  I especially enjoyed Lily and Richard.+ The directing is, to say the least, always experimental.  There are some shots that are so innovative and work really well, but however it also gets to the point where some of the more experimental camera work is a bit jarring.NEGATIVES- The acting, by and large, ranges from mediocre to bad.  While all of the actors do have moments that convince me that there might be a sparkle of talent in there, a lot of the leads are pretty much bad.  Patrick Flueger as Shawn is simply awful, as is Brooke Nevin as Nikki.  None of the cast members steadily impressed me other than Billy Campbell as Jordan and Conchita Campbell as Maia.- The music in the series is very badly picked out.  When they should have used scores, they use cheesy pop culture songs that, while the songs are good by themselves, they sound highly out of place in the show.- The writers seem to be fans of taking the easy way out with character interactions.  Subtlety is completely disregarded for sweeping gestures.  Romance never develops, it explodes into being.  Conflict never simmers before boiling, it always arrives already steaming.While this short season (five episodes in total) is extremely flawed, it's also entertaining television.  It's not at the level where it's a guilty pleasure, because a lot of aspects of it still make it a good show, but the acting, writing, and use of music needs to improve a considerable amount before this can be a show that I can truly appreciate.6/10",3,"A Good, Not Great, Show",1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,2408,"['point', 'series', '4400', ""n't"", 'great', 'show', 'good', 'show', 'most', 'part', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', 'quick', 'season', 'overall', 'story', 'arc', 'handled', 'nicely', 'very', 'intimate', 'show', 'character', 'are', 'introduced', 'quickly', 'skillfully', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'lacking', 'overall', 'package', 'really', 'prevent', 'being', 'same', 'level', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'mysteries', 'likeLostandBattlestar', 'Galactica', ""'ll"", 'break', 'show', 'up', 'list', 'positives', 'negatives.POSITIVES+', 'mystery', 'week', 'sections', 'episodes', 'are', 'lot', 'stronger', 'overall', 'arc', 'season', 'episode', 'told', 'good', 'standalone', 'story', 'driving', 'force', 'being', 'good', 'show.+', 'lot', 'guest', 'stars', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'impressive', 'Especially', 'David', 'Eigenberg', 'episode', 'two', 'Carl', 'Morrisey.+', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'most', 'part', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'Lily', 'Richard.+', 'directing', 'say', 'least', 'always', 'experimental', 'are', 'shots', 'are', 'so', 'innovative', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'however', 'also', 'point', 'where', 'more', 'experimental', 'camera', 'work', 'bit', 'jarring.NEGATIVES-', 'acting', 'large', 'mediocre', 'bad', 'actors', 'do', 'have', 'moments', 'convince', 'might', 'be', 'sparkle', 'talent', 'there', 'lot', 'leads', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'bad', 'Patrick', 'Flueger', 'Shawn', 'simply', 'awful', 'Brooke', 'Nevin', 'Nikki', 'None', 'cast', 'members', 'steadily', 'impressed', 'other', 'Billy', 'Campbell', 'Jordan', 'Conchita', 'Campbell', 'Maia.-', 'music', 'series', 'very', 'badly', 'picked', 'out', 'When', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'scores', 'use', 'cheesy', 'pop', 'culture', 'songs', 'songs', 'are', 'good', 'sound', 'highly', 'place', 'show.-', 'writers', 'seem', 'be', 'fans', 'taking', 'easy', 'way', 'character', 'interactions', 'Subtlety', 'completely', 'disregarded', 'sweeping', 'gestures', 'Romance', 'never', 'being', 'Conflict', 'never', 'simmers', 'boiling', 'always', 'already', 'steaming.While', 'short', 'season', 'five', 'episodes', 'total', 'extremely', 'flawed', 'also', 'entertaining', 'television', 'not', 'level', 'where', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'lot', 'aspects', 'still', 'make', 'good', 'show', 'acting', 'writing', 'use', 'music', 'needs', 'improve', 'considerable', 'amount', 'can', 'be', 'show', 'can', 'truly', 'appreciate.6/10']",The 4400 - The Complete First Season

856470,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00062IDEW,RMurray847,"[8, 10]","I bought this Season more or less on a whim.  My family and I had really enjoyed watching the miniseries TAKEN, from the sci-fi channel on DVD.  Because I don't have cable, I often rely on DVD releases to catch the shows with a lot of buzz.  I had vaguely heard of THE 4400, but bought it more because I hoped it would be good quality entertainment like TAKEN than because I knew much about the show itself.My family and I have been very pleased.  It's a very interesting story, about abductees from the past 60 years or so all being returned to earth on the same day...none having aged one bit and none knowing what has happened to them.  We discover early on that they have all returned a bit ""altered"" too, with some interesting new powers.The idea that these folks have to deal with losing 50 years of their lives (in some cases) and that their loved ones have moved on or died, is compelling.  The new powers are interesting.  And the politics involved in them assimilating back into society are a nice touch.  The gripping pilot episode neatly sets things up and introduces the main characters.We have a Mulder & Scully of sorts...two slightly mismatched investigators from Homeland Security.  This pair investigates a different returnee each episode...learning aobut new powers and trying to figure out the ""ripple effect"" that these new powers are supposed to have.  This makes each episode a tidy stand-alone.  Yet at the same time, each episode explores the characters and developments of a few returnees whom we've followed from the beginning.  A little girl from the '40s.  A black soldier from 1951.  A young housewife from the early 90s and best of all, a teenager from just a couple of years ago, who happens to be the nephew of one of our two lead investigators.  His powers, his relationship with his uncle and connection to his uncle's son are intriguing.So, from a plot standpoint, this is very good stuff.  There are minor quibbles.  For the most part, the show is clearly on a low budget and this is seldom a problem.  Very few true special effects are needed...but when they do trot one out, it's a bit weak.  Not enough to make you groan, but it's good they've found a low tech way to proceed through 99% of the show.  The acting is occasionally spotty.  Joel Gretsch (who I remember well from TAKEN) plays the male investigator, and he's probably the best of the bunch.  He looks like a bit of a hard**s and speaks with authority...yet when called upon to be a bit more emotional, he presents it convincingly.  He's no Oscar-winner, but like the show, he seems to know how much he can push his talents.  Everyone else is okay, with the teens all a bit moody in the ""One Tree Hill"" mode.  No one will win an Emmy for acting in this show...but everyone is at least consistent and they are all pitched at the same level.  They all play it straight and unironic, which is great.  No cynicism...this stuff is real to their characters and the actors stay true to that.\I mentioned X-Files earlier, and there are comparisons beyond the man/woman pair that investigates.  There's the family connection to the events of the day  (lead investigator has a son and nephew who are connected somehow to all the weirdness...Mulder had a sister connected to the conspiracy).  There's the Vancouver locations.  There's the gruff boss (Peter Coyote in THE 4400). Even the feel of the camerawork is often similar.  But the big difference is that no one doubts that weird things are happening or that 4400 people returned.  While I smile at the similarities...I like the show enough not to really care.It's a pretty good show for families, but there is occasional cussing that wouldn't make it on to network TV.  If you are even a casual fan of sci-fi, or X-Files...I highly recommend this well-crafted show.

856472,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00062IDEW,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","There is only one criticism to make about the first season of THE 4400:  It is just so frellin' short!  At five episodes, this is the shortest ""season"" of any show I know of.  In reality, it isn't a season so much as an extended teaser.  But that being said, it is a very effective teaser and definitely pricks the interest of any potential viewer.The show centers around 4400 individuals who had disappeared over the previous few decades and who reappeared all at once and in the same place without any apparent aging.  No one has any memory of who took them or why, though we gradually learn that each of them has been altered in various ways.  One young girl is clairvoyant, a young man can affect the life force of creatures he touches, and one man has the fighting ability of two Bruce Lee's combined, while others have abilities of a more indeterminate nature.  The first few episodes focus on the attempt of the 4400 to reenter their own lives, at the alienation they experience, and on the suspicion that is focused on them by society.  All of this is seen both through the experience of a few of the 4400 along with members of the Department of Homeland Security who are assigned to watch over them.This is a show rife with good things.  I'm a huge fan of the serial format as opposed to the episodic and THE 4400 largely adheres to the serial.  Several of these early episodes focus on a particular one of the 4400--one portrayed by Michael Moriarty in the pilot, one played by SEX AND THE CITY's David Eisenberg in the second--but even then the structure is built more around the story at large than that particular week's character.  Very little is resolved each week, which is a very good thing.  The fewer plot developments that get resolved in an episode, the better the show as a whole.  In addition to format, the show has a wonderful look.  I would like to know more about the camera work on the show.  They have gone for a look that employs both a high definition look with filters that emphasize earth tones rather than garish colors.  It is a wonderful show to look at.Although the show is yet another produce of The Sci-Fi Capital of the World aka Vancouver (the number of top Sci-Fi and fantasy adventure shows produced in Vancouver--THE X-FILES, DARK ANGEL, STARGATE SG-1, STARGATE ATLANTIS, SMALLVILLE, DEAD LIKE ME, MILLENIUM, THE DEAD ZONE, BATTLESTAR GALATICA, THE LONE GUNMEN, SLIDERS, KINGDOM HOSPITAL, THE OUTER LIMITS, EUREKA--dwarfs that of Hollywood), the actors are not the standard group that one finds in most Vancouver productions.  As a result, you get a different feel from the other Vancouver shows, which tend to circulate the same group of actors (as delightful as they are).  In later seasons some of those actors are used, but to a much smaller degree than, say, SMALLVILLE and STARGATE SG-1, two shows that have had a vast overlap in guest stars.Not a lot gets resolved in Season One.  It isn't much to say that it leaves you wanting more, since it didn't give a whole lot to begin with.  The two subsequent seasons were twelve episodes each, more than the first season but together comprising only as many episodes as a regular season of most other shows.  It is therefore a very different show from most, almost more on the British model of a small number of episodes rather than a large number.  But if one gets past the very small number of episodes this can be one of the most compelling Sci-Fi series on TV.",5,Short but sweet -- the debut of a very promising Sci-fi series,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,3459,"['only', 'one', 'criticism', 'make', 'first', 'season', 'THE', '4400', 'just', 'so', 'frellin', 'short', 'five', 'episodes', 'shortest', 'season', 'show', 'know', 'reality', ""n't"", 'season', 'so', 'much', 'extended', 'teaser', 'being', 'said', 'very', 'effective', 'teaser', 'definitely', 'interest', 'potential', 'viewer.The', 'show', 'centers', '4400', 'individuals', 'who', 'had', 'disappeared', 'previous', 'few', 'decades', 'who', 'reappeared', 'once', 'same', 'place', 'apparent', 'aging', 'one', 'memory', 'who', 'took', 'why', 'gradually', 'learn', 'been', 'altered', 'various', 'ways', 'One', 'young', 'girl', 'clairvoyant', 'young', 'man', 'can', 'affect', 'life', 'force', 'creatures', 'one', 'man', 'fighting', 'ability', 'two', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'combined', 'others', 'have', 'abilities', 'more', 'indeterminate', 'nature', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'focus', 'attempt', '4400', 'reenter', 'own', 'lives', 'alienation', 'experience', 'suspicion', 'focused', 'society', 'seen', 'experience', 'few', '4400', 'members', 'Department', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'who', 'are', 'assigned', 'watch', 'them.This', 'show', 'rife', 'good', 'things', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'serial', 'format', 'opposed', 'episodic', 'THE', '4400', 'largely', 'serial', 'Several', 'early', 'episodes', 'focus', 'particular', 'one', '4400', 'one', 'portrayed', 'Michael', 'Moriarty', 'pilot', 'one', 'played', 'SEX', 'THE', 'CITY', 'David', 'Eisenberg', 'second', 'even', 'then', 'structure', 'built', 'more', 'story', 'large', 'particular', 'week', 'character', 'Very', 'little', 'resolved', 'week', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'fewer', 'plot', 'developments', 'get', 'resolved', 'episode', 'better', 'show', 'whole', 'addition', 'format', 'show', 'wonderful', 'look', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'more', 'camera', 'work', 'show', 'have', 'gone', 'look', 'high', 'definition', 'look', 'filters', 'emphasize', 'earth', 'tones', 'rather', 'garish', 'colors', 'wonderful', 'show', 'look', 'show', 'yet', 'produce', 'Sci-Fi', 'Capital', 'World', 'aka', 'Vancouver', 'number', 'top', 'Sci-Fi', 'fantasy', 'adventure', 'shows', 'produced', 'Vancouver', 'X-FILES', 'DARK', 'ANGEL', 'STARGATE', 'SG-1', 'STARGATE', 'ATLANTIS', 'SMALLVILLE', 'DEAD', 'LIKE', 'ME', 'MILLENIUM', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'ZONE', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALATICA', 'THE', 'LONE', 'GUNMEN', 'SLIDERS', 'KINGDOM', 'HOSPITAL', 'THE', 'OUTER', 'LIMITS', 'EUREKA', 'dwarfs', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'are', 'not', 'standard', 'group', 'one', 'most', 'Vancouver', 'productions', 'result', 'get', 'different', 'feel', 'other', 'Vancouver', 'shows', 'tend', 'circulate', 'same', 'group', 'actors', 'as', 'delightful', 'are', 'later', 'seasons', 'actors', 'are', 'used', 'much', 'smaller', 'degree', 'say', 'SMALLVILLE', 'STARGATE', 'SG-1', 'two', 'shows', 'have', 'had', 'vast', 'overlap', 'guest', 'stars.Not', 'lot', 'resolved', 'Season', 'One', ""n't"", 'much', 'say', 'wanting', 'more', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'whole', 'lot', 'begin', 'two', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'were', 'twelve', 'episodes', 'more', 'first', 'season', 'together', 'comprising', 'only', 'as', 'many', 'episodes', 'regular', 'season', 'most', 'other', 'shows', 'therefore', 'very', 'different', 'show', 'most', 'almost', 'more', 'British', 'model', 'small', 'number', 'episodes', 'rather', 'large', 'number', 'one', 'very', 'small', 'number', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'Sci-Fi', 'series', 'TV']",The 4400 - The Complete First Season

While the X-Files was centered around Mulder and Scully and they had cases come to them that covered the gammit from seamonster to possession to little green men the 4400's agents Tom Baldwin and Diana Skouris have one central case that they are assigned to with many other smaller cases being branched off of it.The case Baldwin and Skouris are investigating is ""What happened to the 4400?""  That is what the entire series centers around, the Orson Baily phenomenon, the Oliver Knox copycat, and the arsons that sprout up are all parts of the larger question.The acting in this series itself is supurb, for example you have Richard Tyler (Ali) who was abducted in the 1950s in South Korea.  When Richard returns he is first seen looking through a magazine saying ""The Secretary of State is black!"" And eight year old Cochita Campbell who plays Maia Ruteledge displays such courage and toughness having been abducted in 1938.  An example is in the pilot when the foster parents that Maia was set up in bring her back to quarentine and Ryland talks to her opening the conversation with a remark on the weather, Maia responds with ""You didn't come out here to talk with me about the weather.""There is also a great score to scenes that signify importance, like in the scene where the abductees return.  The score is so bone-chilling that it terrifies the viewer.There is also a romance factor to the story as well as Richard Tyler and Lily Moore hook up because Richard knew her grandmother. Other factors in this series include rage, that of a father not being able to help his son, and caring as Diana takes eight-year-old Maia home to live with her because as Maia states ""I don't like being alone and you don't like being alone either.""All in all THE 4400 is a well thought out, well put together series that should be given a chance.Note: Just as a sidenote, Jacqueline Mckenzie, who plays Diana Skouris was actually given the holster that Gillian Anderson used to play Agent Scully (the holster didn't fit as Mckenzie states, ""It liked like I had another arm petruding from my hip,"").",5,This is not the X-Files...it is something much grander...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2163,"['Alot', 'fans', 'have', 'related', '4400', 'X-FILES', 'not', 'X-Files', 'X-Files', 'was', 'centered', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'had', 'cases', 'come', 'covered', 'gammit', 'seamonster', 'possession', 'little', 'green', 'men', '4400', 'agents', 'Tom', 'Baldwin', 'Diana', 'Skouris', 'have', 'one', 'central', 'case', 'are', 'assigned', 'many', 'other', 'smaller', 'cases', 'being', 'branched', 'it.The', 'case', 'Baldwin', 'Skouris', 'are', 'investigating', 'What', 'happened', '4400', 'what', 'entire', 'series', 'centers', 'Orson', 'Baily', 'phenomenon', 'Oliver', 'Knox', 'copycat', 'arsons', 'sprout', 'up', 'are', 'parts', 'larger', 'question.The', 'acting', 'series', 'supurb', 'example', 'have', 'Richard', 'Tyler', 'Ali', 'who', 'was', 'abducted', '1950s', 'South', 'Korea', 'When', 'Richard', 'first', 'seen', 'looking', 'magazine', 'saying', 'Secretary', 'State', 'black', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'Cochita', 'Campbell', 'who', 'Maia', 'Ruteledge', 'displays', 'such', 'courage', 'toughness', 'having', 'been', 'abducted', '1938', 'example', 'pilot', 'when', 'foster', 'parents', 'Maia', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'bring', 'back', 'quarentine', 'Ryland', 'talks', 'opening', 'conversation', 'remark', 'weather', 'Maia', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'here', 'talk', 'weather', 'also', 'great', 'score', 'scenes', 'signify', 'importance', 'scene', 'where', 'abductees', 'return', 'score', 'so', 'bone-chilling', 'viewer.There', 'also', 'romance', 'factor', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'Richard', 'Tyler', 'Lily', 'Moore', 'hook', 'up', 'because', 'Richard', 'knew', 'grandmother', 'Other', 'factors', 'series', 'include', 'rage', 'father', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'help', 'son', 'caring', 'Diana', 'eight-year-old', 'Maia', 'home', 'live', 'because', 'Maia', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'alone', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'alone', 'either', '4400', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'series', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'chance.Note', 'Just', 'sidenote', 'Jacqueline', 'Mckenzie', 'who', 'Diana', 'Skouris', 'was', 'actually', 'given', 'holster', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'used', 'play', 'Agent', 'Scully', 'holster', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'Mckenzie', 'states', 'liked', 'had', 'arm', 'petruding', 'hip']",The 4400 - The Complete First Season

We have all heard the stories and we have witnessed people telling us that something were out there. But what if there was and we were  being ignorant in our understanding? All at once 4400 people appear in the middle of nowhere, with no memory of where they have been. What's more, the people have not aged and seem to be exactly the same as they were. Well, they do until they are looked at. Then there is the man and his anger, the little girl who sees, the A-American gentleman who dated a woman named Lily who just so happens to have a granddaughter amongst these people, and an agent with a boy that has been in a coma for a long, long time.When this story began, I thought it had a great taste to it. i had missed out on the previous viewings and i bought the DVD and, well, it has the shows on it and not much else. It has 5 episodes in all, including the Pilot, and a lot of things happen. important things. One I like a lot was the idea not to quarantine the people. As one person noted, ""if they are as danger as you say, what good would putting them in one place be?"" There's more.The acting here is superb and has some veteran talents. I liked seeing a cold man turned good guy from The Taken series here, because she showed me what EBE could mean with him in it. The kids selected are great, especially the young girl, and the delivery of new information is wonderful. I see threads slinking out and allowing a person to know a million things and yet not grasp it all, making me think of Dark Skies and FlashForward seeing a linked grandfather. It was beautiful, and I loved it.The world here is big for the words I am giving but spoiling a lot would be sinister. I just want you to watch because it has such a pull and, really, I was a late person to it as well. a 5/5 here, no doubt, even though the Pilot was restrained by budget and some green screen is noticed.a passing note - you might want to look into a combined set if you really want it all.

The five episodes here introduce the premise (that 4400 people were abducted over a period of about 60 years and all returned en masse without having aged a day since their disappearances). Along the way, we're privy to some interesting social commentary--this was at the height of the Bush administration, the PATRIOTAct, etc.--and story arcs that immediately began to evolve and sprawl before our eyes (something that we DS9 fans found quite familiar). These first five episodes are structured more like a mini-series (which is all the show was at the time of production) and gorging is easily the way to go here.As for the DVD release, Paramount gave us no extra content at all; not even a promo ad for the series. Each episode opens with a recap of previous plot threads, which may have made sense for weekly, over-the-air broadcast but is extraneous on DVD.

856484,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B00062IDEW,Wheelchair Assassin,"[3, 3]","While I didn't get into it at first for whatever reason, when a friend of mine loaned me season one of The 4400 on DVD I figured I'd bite, and I must say I wish I had been watching from the beginning.  This first season certainly isn't on the level of the debut seasons of, say, The Shield or The Sopranos, but it does present some interesting twists on the sci-fi format it initially appears to belong to.  In actuality, The 4400 is sort of a sci-fi/drama/mystery hybrid, and while it suffers a little bit from some hackneyed dialogue and not-so-special effects, The 4400 is still a mostly intelligent show whose steadily unfolding mysteries and shifting character dynamics make it more than worth tuning into.  The plot, as the title suggests, goes thusly: 4400 people, randomly abducted without a trace in various times and places, suddenly return in a ball of light in suburban Seattle, uninjured, dressed as they were when they disappeared, and with no memory whatsoever of what happened while they were gone.  That's not to say they haven't been profoundly changed during their trip, as several of the returnees start manifesting new and superhuman abilities right after they get back, and one woman finds herself pregnant with no logical explanation.  Naturally, the returnees have to face a world where a lot's changed but a lot has stayed the same as well, as the general public is no more rational or tolerant than it was before, and returning to society presents them with all kinds of problems.  This first season follows the efforts of some of the 4400, with the government's help, to get integrated back into society even as it becomes clear there's something different about them that won't make it easy.The show's emphasis on the paranormal definitely gives it an X-Files-like feel, but it never follows a freak-of-the-week format, as its stand-alone plots are always integrated into the master narrative, and its sociological aspects are more comparable to the X-Men movies than anything else.  For a mere five episodes (including a two-hour pilot), the show does manage to cram in a lot of plotlines that nicely mix personal drama with social and political intrigue.  The pilot episode was a little rough-the direction and production values are similar to those of, well, a TV movie, and the writing produces a few howlers-but it does set the stage for its stories of people returning to a changed world and facing the changes in themselves, and those who are forgiving enough to keep watching will be rewarded with increasing returns on the show's intriguing premise.  The pilot makes the first intimations of special powers among the returnees, ranging from telekinesis to clairvoyance, and later episodes start exploring the connections and meaning behind these new gifts as a grand design starts to emerge.  It quickly becomes apparent that the 4400 were taken and returned for a reason, with single-episode plots exploring the ripple effects that result from the returnees' actions while the Feds try to connect the dots.The show's two main characters-Homeland Security agents Tom Baldwin and Diana Skouris-are basically variations on Agents Mulder and Scully, but both do eventually manage to emerge as interesting characters.  Initially, Tom's the intense, emotional family-man type, while Diana is the perpetually single, married-to-the-job type, but they each evolve over the course of the season as their investigations reveal new details behind the 4400's cases and their deeper implications.  They both have also clear emotional attachments to the work they're doing-Tom's nephew was taken and his son left in a three-year coma; Diana takes mildly creepy clairvoyant eight-year-old Maia into her apartment-and as the season goes on the intermingling of their professional and private lives becomes increasingly complicated by events.Beyond the domestic drama, though, the show works largely because it's plugged into the atmosphere of fear and suspicion that accompanies the unknown.  The 4400 have come back as suddenly as they disappeared, under mysterious circumstances and with new powers, and naturally people's curiosity eventually gives way to media-driven fearmongering and anger at governmental secrecy, especially when a returned serial killer picks up his murder spree after a twenty-year absence.  Obviously there are some parallels to be made with the events of today as fears of immigration and terrorism have produced all kinds of craziness and overblown rhetoric (some of it justified, some not), but the hatred and prejudice the 4400 create speaks to something that goes beyond any one time, place or issue.  Sometimes it's as personal as it is political, as when Tom's nephew Shawn has to face life as a returnee in high school (which sucked enough on its own, as I recall) along with the animosity of his resentful younger brother.  Sometimes it's a mixture of both, as when inexplicably pregnant Lily and her black ex-combat pilot boyfriend find themselves welcomed by returned real-estate tycoon Jordan Collier and quickly start to question the motives behind his friendliness.I've heard season two sort of fulfills the promise of season one, but since I'm pretty sure I have to give this one back before I can get it I probably won't know for a while.  Based on what I've seen, though, it's highly plausible that this brief season (really more akin to a miniseries than anything else) could be the setup for something better.  Once some of the early kinks (overwritten dialogue, weak production values, occasionally melodramatic acting) were ironed out and the main narrative started picking up steam, I for one found myself intrigued about what would happen next.  Fortunately, it appears the story is far from over.",3,"Iffy, but promising",1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,5769,"['did', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'reason', 'when', 'friend', 'mine', 'loaned',

856485,A38N7SFDOB3MR3,B00062IDEW,Wisconsin Dad,"[5, 5]","I have been watching and reading sci-fi and fantasy for nearly 3 decades, and when I heard about the original plot of the 4400, I knew I had to see it.The pilot episode reveals the story of the 4400, people who were taken from earth, only to reappear by Mt. Rainier many years later. They now have special powers. Many have said that the 4400 is a cross between the X-files and X-men. I would go one step further. The 4400 also is very soap opera-y, with stories of love, pregancy, divorce, business manuevers, etc.After watching the first disk from season one, I was left with the impression that the show had a lot of potential, but wasn't quite there yet. As with all knew shows of this type, there is a ""feeling around"" process where the stories and actors who make them come alive take baby steps to flesh out the universe and their characters. I am looking forward to viewing the next episodes.With that said, in watching the first season I became concerned that the casting decisions might be a little weak. Certain characters just don't ""feel right."" Take this for what its worth, and it might just be a personal choice.In watching shows that have amazing casting, like Firefly, everything seems to fit. Everything seems natural. many things in the 4400 didn't seem to fit, connect, or work well together.Peter Coyote seemed to be playing the same character he has been in nearly every movie I have seen him in. There is just something about him that distracts me from the story. I can't place my finger on it, but I am not sure he is the right man to play the Skinner-esque role. Understand, I am not yearning that this become the X-files.Also, Jacqueline McKenzie as Diana Skouris and Joel Gretsch as Tom Baldwin don't feel quite right as well. This may simply be due to the fact that the first 2 episodes haven't show Skouris exercising much of her science speciality, and haven't revealed Baldwin doing any real detective work. They don't stand out enough yet, and I think part of this is the writer's fault, and maybe because they weren't the right actors to play the roles. 3 hours in, I didn't find myself gaining an affection for them.Another thing the show hasn't done well yet is fleshing out the characters into 3 dimensions. We see the same characters emoting the same emotions and personas. Lily Moore Tyler could use a laugh, and dittos for Richard Tyler. Early on we see the same characetrs performing the same roles, and haven't witnessed many layers of character yet.I know some people might dismiss my opinions, and that is OK. I do not hate the show. Again, I think it has a lot of potential. But I have seen sci-fi shows with amazing casts (again: Firefly, X-files, et al), and the 4400 crew isn't as lovable, likable or fluid as I am yearning for. Hopeully, as I watch future episodes, things will grow.",4,Good Potential.
