This film seems to be set in the future...but also the past:  It is ageless.  It is like entering a Maxfield Parrish painting while having Wagner perform live in the background and the neo-classical leitmotif is used throughout the picture.  There are so many interpretations to this film, but I loved the duality of the movie, a good girl vs. a bad girl and a good planet vs. a bad planet and how their roles reverse by the end of the movie. The visual artistry of the film is breathtaking.  Every single frame is beautiful neo-classical art.  The scene with Justine (Dunst) illuminated by blue light from a blue planet -- Parrish blue bathed Justine on the bank of a river -- is the most exquisite frame in the film.  There was an element of improvisation on behalf of the actors courtesy of Lars von Trier (director) and this allowed a more realistic portrayal of characters.  This was pure genius also.  I have watched the movie four times during my rental period and will buy it.  I watch it over and over and each time I come away with a different interpretation and understanding.  It is the finest film of the year and Kirsten Dunst deserves the Oscar for Best Actress.",5,The Best Movie of 2011,1322611200,"11 30, 2011",2011,1302,"['Where', 'begin', 'end', 'movie', 'very', 'difficult', '5-star', 'film', 'cinematic', 'artistic', 'genius', 'film', 'be', 'set', 'future', 'also', 'past', 'ageless', 'entering', 'Maxfield', 'Parrish', 'painting', 'having', 'Wagner', 'perform', 'live', 'background', 'neo-classical', 'leitmotif', 'used', 'picture', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'interpretations', 'film', 'loved', 'duality', 'movie', 'good', 'girl', 'vs.', 'bad', 'girl', 'good', 'planet', 'vs.', 'bad', 'planet', 'how', 'roles', 'reverse', 'end', 'movie', 'visual', 'artistry', 'film', 'breathtaking', 'single', 'frame', 'beautiful', 'neo-classical', 'art', 'scene', 'Justine', 'Dunst', 'illuminated', 'blue', 'light', 'blue', 'planet', 'Parrish', 'blue', 'bathed', 'Justine', 'bank', 'river', 'most', 'exquisite', 'frame', 'film', 'was', 'element', 'improvisation', 'behalf', 'actors', 'courtesy', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'director', 'allowed', 'more', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'was', 'pure', 'genius', 'also', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'four', 'times', 'rental', 'period', 'will', 'buy', 'watch', 'time', 'come', 'away', 'different', 'interpretation', 'understanding', 'finest', 'film', 'year', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress']",N/A
1498335,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005S9EI2Y,A kids review,"[5, 8]","Danish director Lars von Trier got into a bit of trouble last year when he made some controversial comments at the Cannes Film Festival, where he had previously enjoyed a great deal of success with his films. It's unfortunate, because the film he premiered there, Melancholia, was great, even earning its lead, Kirsten Dunst, the festival's award for Best Actress. The film, split into halves, focuses on two sisters -- Justine, whose wedding reception makes up the first half of the film, and Claire, in whose house the reception is held and where Justine spends the second half of the movie suffering from depression. At the same time, Earth is on a collision course with another planet called Melancholia, guaranteeing the end of human life, and each character finds different ways to cope. Melancholia is bolstered primarily by Dunst's powerhouse performance and by von Trier's distinct and personal vision of depression and destruction. It's not what you would call a ""feelgood"" movie, but it's poignant and beautifully shot, for those who are interested.",3,Melancholia,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,1060,"['Danish', 'director', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'got', 'bit', 'trouble', 'last', 'year', 'when', 'made', 'controversial', 'comments', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'where', 'had', 'previously', 'enjoyed', 'great', 'deal', 'success', 'films', 'unfortunate', 'film', 'premiered', 'there', 'Melancholia', 'was', 'great', 'even', 'earning', 'lead', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'festival', 'award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'film', 'split', 'halves', 'focuses', 'two', 'sisters', 'Justine', 'wedding', 'reception', 'up', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Claire', 'house', 'reception', 'held', 'where', 'Justine', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'suffering', 'depression', 'same', 'time', 'Earth', 'collision', 'course', 'planet', 'called', 'Melancholia', 'guaranteeing', 'end', 'human', 'life', 'character', 'different', 'ways', 'cope', 'Melancholia', 'bolstered', 'primarily', 'Dunst', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'von', 'Trier', 'distinct', 'personal', 'vision', 'depression', 'destruction', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'feelgood', 'movie', 'poignant', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'who', 'are', 'interested']",N/A

1498337,A2Q05I3W8HAROC,B005S9EI2Y,"Amanda Jane Volovik ""Chava""","[1, 3]","Reviewed by Amanda Volovik ""Chava"": The 'co-plot' surrounds two sisters who are 'melancholic' and our snapshots into their rich and dysfunctional lives. Of course, the name of the planet is an analogy for the sad atmosphere of the film, no great revelation there. Kirsten Dunst as the bride with a case of Major Depression did okay with the languid, time-stands-still movie style she was given to work with. Her sister, Charlotte Gainsbourg, just has a way about her in every modern movie she's in that's hard to watch, the only place I saw it fit is when she starred in 'Jane Eyre' and other period pieces. Gainsbourg's almost ghostly presence, ready-to-faint vulnerability, and shock-filled, open-mouthed stares in related scenes is so..very...'DONE'. I'm OVER it. I just didn't feel any compassion for Gainsbourg's grating character here - close-up scenes of her angst went on eternally.***Possible Spoiler Alert***I gave this three stars  because the concept around a planet coming near the earth and its analogy to a family in crisis was quite well done here. I enjoyed the realistic visuals of the planet and its gradual movement, which added suspense. No continuous rain of fireballs coming towards earth or dramatic atmospheric/environmental changes as other movies depict.",3,"Very Interesting Concept: However, it is Slow-Paced, Long and Actress Gainsbourg is Irritating",1345766400,"08 24, 2012",2012,1281,"['Reviewed', 'Amanda', 'Volovik', 'Chava', ""'co-plot"", 'surrounds', 'two', 'sisters', 'who', 'are', ""'melancholic"", 'snapshots', 'rich', 'dysfunctional', 'lives', 'course', 'name', 'planet', 'analogy', 'sad', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'great', 'revelation', 'there', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'bride', 'case', 'Major', 'Depression', 'did', 'okay', 'languid', 'time-stands-still', 'movie', 'style', 'was', 'given', 'work', 'sister', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'just', 'way', 'modern', 'movie', 'hard', 'watch', 'only', 'place', 'saw', 'fit', 'when', 'starred', ""'Jane"", 'Eyre', 'other', 'period', 'pieces', 'Gainsbourg', 'almost', 'ghostly', 'presence', 'ready-to-faint', 'vulnerability', 'shock-filled', 'open-mouthed', 'stares', 'related', 'scenes', 'so..very', ""'m"", 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'compassion', 'Gainsbourg', 'grating', 'character', 'here', 'close-up', 'scenes', 'angst', 'went', 'eternally', '***Possible', 'Spoiler', 'Alert***I', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'concept', 'planet', 'coming', 'earth', 'analogy', 'family', 'crisis', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'here', 'enjoyed', 'realistic', 'visuals', 'planet', 'gradual', 'movement', 'added', 'suspense', 'continuous', 'rain', 'fireballs', 'coming', 'towards', 'earth', 'dramatic', 'atmospheric/environmental', 'changes', 'other', 'movies', 'depict']",N/A

I think the Justine character is magnificently well acted as a realistic victim of major depression who sabotages her life but comes easily to terms with the end, while her sister (who can at some point cross an uncrossable bridge) cannot bring herself to accept the end. This is a film to think about for a good while after seeing it, and then see it again for details that one missed the first time. I'm not a great fan of von Trier's earlier work, but I think he is finally coming a bit down to Earth.

1498343,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005S9EI2Y,Andrew Ellington,"[8, 12]","`Melancholia' is a film that is going to be extremely divisive.  Not everyone is going to appreciate this, and yet there are going to be some that laud this as one of the finest films ever made.  I can certainly see its flaws, and yet there is this underlying captivating atmosphere that I can't help but wholly appreciate.`Melancholia' is a unique and engrossing experience that is less what it seems and more what you'd come to expect from an auteur as controversial as Lars von Trier.The opening montage of cataclysmic destruction plays out like a Vogue editorial shoot captured in slow motion.  It seems almost anticlimactic to show us the end before the beginning, and while I understand that this cinematic trick (or gimmick) is initially rather off-putting and presumes to fail the overall purpose of the film somewhat by showing us the cause of concern before we truly understand the concern building in the key characters, it works in a way that I can't quite explain.  I personally was rather upset with the sequence upon watching it, but as the film tied itself together I found myself calling it to mind with awe for I saw how the pieces of that puzzle came together in an unexpected way.And, one cannot forsake its beauty.And then the actual film starts, which is broken into two sections.The first part of `Melancholia' focuses on Justine, the bride.  Her lavish wedding begins with promise.  Her `filthy rich' brother-in-law has paid for the spectacle to take place at his gigantic home, complete with a butler, an 18 hole golf course and a slew of guest rooms (with baths, not showers).  The joyous couple show up late, thanks to an oversized limo and some narrowly curved roads, and then all joy seems to evaporate as Justine's intense depression sets in and begins to erode her happiness.  Everyone around her fails to understand her condition, even though most of them try (especially her groom and her sister).  Justine seems bewitched by a red star she seems looming overhead; a star that goes unseen by the others.  This star sets a strange precedent for the remains of the evening as Justine's behavior becomes more reclusive and catatonic almost.Bridges are burned, relationships are broken all hope is lost.The second half switches focus to Claire, the elder sister.  While Justine is certainly suffering from depression, Claire begins to delve into paranoia as the impending collision with the mysterious planet Melancholia grows closer and closer.  They don't ever say how much time as elapsed since the wedding, where that `star' first reared its head, but Justine is still sulking in misery and the agitation she caused on that `blessed day' obviously still lingers.""It tastes like ashes.""With only five days left before Melancholia is supposed to `pass' Earth, Claire and Justine begin to come to terms with the inevitabilities of their futures.At the core of `Melancholia' is a sharply constructed look at mental instability and the effect it has on our own personal survival.  Justine's character is of particular interest because her depression, which is initially assumed to stem from the planet traveling towards Earth, is almost eased by the foreknowledge that the end is coming.  She possesses a unique bond with the planet, a connection (as seen by her nude moon-bathing) that helps ease her dissention since she is obviously of the accord that life on Earth is corrupted; infected with an evil that, even in its most unintuitive form is still prevalent and contaminating.For her, eradication is a way out of a life she cannot support.From a technical standpoint, `Melancholia' is something special.  The imagery is stunning.  Lars von Trier has a great track record of using a film's cinematography to eclipse the viewer and sustain his themes.  `Antichrist' was a film that suffered in conception and yet it was sustained to a degree thanks to the beautiful and captivating way in which it was shot (not to mention Gainsbourg's phenomenal performance).  Here, the night sky is illuminated by cascading stars and eerily shifted cloud structures.  Even the murky yet polished way in which the close-ups are rendered is astonishing to watch.  I was really taken by the nostalgic score, one that embodied the same sound and atmosphere as the classic apocalyptic and science fiction films.  The drama is there, bolded with each swell in the music.Performance-wise, the film belongs to Kirsten Dunst.  She is remarkable here.  This is a truly restrained and intimate performance, no real showboating or dramatics involved.  Instead, Dunst takes a far more realistic look at depression by holding it all in.  Sure, she has her crying fits and breakdowns, but she internalizes so much.  I'm so happy for her Cannes win, especially since Oscar will most likely look the other way (they like their actresses to SHOW their pain), but I completely concur with many who say this is quite possibly her finest work.  She has been one of my favorite actresses for years, and I am so thrilled to see her making some intriguing and rewarding film choices (she should have won the Oscar last year for her tremendous work in `All Good Things').  I also was wholly impressed with Kiefer Sutherland, who dwelled in the skin of his character, adding little touches that made him feel complete as opposed to a mere prop (unlike the younger Skarsgard, who just proved uninteresting).  Kiefer portrays an odd warmth, paternal and yet elusively selfish.  You can see his colors changing as the film progresses, and his many shades, while never blatant or wholly exposed, haunt long after he's left the screen.In the end, `Melancholia' is probably the strangest `apocalyptic' film you'll ever see, and while it contains certain flaws, those flaws are swallowed and digested by the films ravenous pluses.  The pacing is extraordinary (don't listen to the naysayers claiming this film drags, for it most certainly does not) for it allows the impending dread to set it slowly, meticulously, calculated and yet entirely natural so that you feel yourself letting go as you watch Justine and Claire prepare themselves for the afterlife.",5,Behold; the Death-Star!,1319587200,"10 26,

Where that was about people trying to come to grips with their faith, eventually guided by a Christ imitating figure capable of miraculous ressurection, Melancholia is the perfect inverse of that scenario.  Rather than the mad messianistic brother in Ordet, we have the mad, near-catatonic, hopeless Dunst - the only figure who can guide her sister and nephew into pain and death, in a world that has no g-d or after life: ""No one will miss us.""  The close was weirdly beautiful and I think the film is at least worth one try for everyone, even if you have to break it down into 1/2 hour segments to keep from being bored.As others have also suggested, check out Another Earth and The Tree of Life, since they have similar plot structures/themes.

1498350,A2582KMXLK2P06,B005S9EI2Y,B. E Jackson,"[4, 10]","Melancholia HAS to be one of the biggest disappointments -not to mention most misleading descriptions for a film- of all-time.  It says Melancholia is a science fiction movie.  Um... not a chance.  It's supposed to be about a planet heading for Earth and destroying everyone and everything that makes up our wonderful planet, but... it not only falls short of that, it spends too much time avoiding the *main* *purpose* of the storyline.  That being, the fear, sadness, confusion and eventual ending of planet Earth.  Showing the occasional appearance of a planet passing by in the sky isn't enough to define science fiction (despite how destructively beautiful it may have appeared, which is probably the only reason the film got the name ""science fiction"").Where to start with this mess...First of all, the first half is entirely pointless.  ENTIRELY pointless.  If you can find anything worthwhile about it, I guess you either don't care that you're not getting what you've tuned in for (planetary destruction) or you like long-winded weddings.  Oh wait, before I mention the wedding... the first 10 mintues is nothing but a heavily orchestrated, overlong, slow-moving montage of different events related to the collision of two planets.  However this scene is *so* long that you simply end up bored with it eventually.  It misleads viewers into thinking something much bigger and worthwhile is coming with unbelievable cinematography to boot, but sadly that's not the case.  However I will admit the way it's presented is somewhat enchanting and pretty to admire.  I can appreciate it on a much different level, at least.Anyway, yes, Kirsten Dunst has an hour long wedding for the first half of the movie.  Basically a series of mishaps occur that eventually end up completely ruining the wedding, not to mention the mother and sister not exactly being supportive of Kirsten's wedding so they act like total jerks with bad attitudes while Kirsten is trying to celebrate the most meaningful day of her life.  What the HECK is this?  A planet is heading towards Earth.  But... a wedding is occurring with soap opera-quality drama instead.  Who came up with this crap?Now the SECOND half of the movie is when some minor improvements occur.  It's now obvious that the planet is coming into Earth's territory and a collision is either inevitable, or that the people will be spared barring a miracle (I won't reveal which one).  Kiefer Sutherland does a remarkable job keeping everyone in his family at ease with his strong firm belief that the planet will veer to the side and miss Earth completely, however there's something really odd about this- nobody is showing believable concern that their lives very well could be over very soon, and quite tragically.  I don't get it.  However Kirsten Dunst going through an episode of depression I *guess* could actually happen, though I'd like to believe a depressed person wouldn't be in such a state given what's about to come.  I could be wrong, though.  It's hard to say how a depressed person would react to such an event.  It might even bring them peace, relief or happiness.The ending is remarkable at least.  That's when the movie truly deserves 2 stars.  The final 15 minutes of confusion and the several ""What to do/where to go?"" moments are worth sticking with the 1 hour/40 minutes of boredom before this.  But MAN!  Why does a wedding have to dominate the first half?  What purpose does it serve, seriously?  If you think a wedding occurring under such unusual circumstances is abnormal, you're right, it is.  It'd be like a wedding taking place on Pearl Harbor during World War II.  Not the least bit believable.The film laughably tries splitting up the story into two separate portions with two separate stories involving the two sisters, but the concept honestly fails since the wedding in the first part truthfully doesn't belong in such a film.  I have no idea why the movie writers felt the need to even split the movie into two separate stories.  Unless they didn't have enough writing for the second (more important) story.  They probably wanted to add a fresh twist to the old and familiar ""The world is coming to end!"" plotline, but this is NOT the kind of refreshment that works.You've been warned with this one, folks.  I can almost gurantee you're NOT getting what you think you are with Melancholia.",2,the horses in the barn are the lucky ones,1370217600,"06 3, 2013",2013,4369,"['Melancholia', 'HAS', 'be', 'one', 'biggest', 'disappointments', '-not', 'mention', 'most', 'misleading', 'descriptions', 'film-', 'all-time', 'Melancholia', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'Um', 'not', 'chance', 'supposed', 'be', 'planet', 'heading', 'Earth', 'destroying', 'everyone', 'everything', 'up', 'wonderful', 'planet', 'not', 'only', 'short', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'avoiding', '*main*', '*purpose*', 'storyline', 'being', 'fear', 'sadness', 'confusion', 'eventual', 'ending', 'planet', 'Earth', 'Showing', 'occasional', 'appearance', 'planet', 'passing', 'sky', ""n't"", 'enough', 'define', 'science', 'fiction', 'how', 'destructively', 'beautiful', 'may', 'have', 'appeared', 'probably', 'only', 'reason', 'film', 'got', 'name', 'science', 'fiction', '.Where', 'start', 'mess', 'First', 'all', 'first', 'half', 'entirely', 'pointless', 'ENTIRELY', 'pointless', 'can', 'find', 'anything', 'worthwhile', 'guess', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', ""'re"", 'not', 'getting', 'what', ""'ve"", 'tuned', 'planetary', 'destruction', 'long-winded', 'weddings', 'Oh', 'wait', 'mention', 'wedding', 'first', '10', 'mintues', 'nothing', 'heavily', 'orchestrated', 'overlong', 'slow-moving', 'montage', 'different', 'events', 'related', 'collision', 'two', 'planets', 'However', 'scene', '*so*', 'long', 'simply', 'end', 'up', 'bored', 'eventually', 'viewers', 'thinking', 'something', 'much', 'bigger', 'worthwhile', 'coming', 'unbelievable', 'cinematography', 'boot', 'sadly', 'not', 'case', 'However', 'will', 'admit', 'way', 'presented', 'somewhat', 'enchanting', 'pretty', 'admire', 'can', 'appreciate', 'much', 'different', 'level', 'least.Anyway', 'yes', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'hour', 'long', 'wedding', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'Basically', 'series', 'mishaps', 'occur', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'completely', 'ruining', 'wedding', 'not', 'mention', 'mother', 'sister', 'not', 'exactly', 'being', 'supportive', 'Kirsten', 'wedding', 'so', 'act', 'total', 'jerks', 'bad', 'attitudes', 'Kirsten', 'trying', 'celebrate', 'most', 'meaningful', 'day', 'life', 'What', 'HECK', 'planet', 'heading', 'towards', 'Earth', 'wedding', 'occurring', 'soap', 'opera-quality', 'drama', 'instead', 'Who', 'came', 'up', 'crap', 'Now', 'SECOND', 'half', 'movie', 'when', 'minor', 'improvements', 'occur', 'now', 'obvious', 'planet', 'coming', 'Earth', 'territory', 'collision', 'inevitable', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'spared', 'barring', 'miracle', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'one', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'remarkable', 'job', 'keeping', 'everyone', 'family', 'ease', 'strong', 'firm', 'belief', 'planet', 'will', 'veer', 'side', 'miss', 'Earth', 'completely', 'however', 'something', 'really', 'odd', 'this-', 'nobody', 'showing', 'believable', 'concern', 'lives', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'be', 'over', 'very', 'soon', 'quite', 'tragically', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'However', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'going', 'episode', 'depression', '*guess*', 'could', 'actually', 'happen', ""'d"", 'like', 'believe', 'depressed', 'person', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'such', 'state', 'given', 'what', 'about', 'come', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'though', 'hard', 'say', 'how', 'depressed', 'person', 'would', 'react', 'event', 'might', 'even', 'bring', 'peace', 'relief', 'happiness.The', 'ending', 'remarkable', 'least', 'when', 'movie', 'truly', '2', 'stars', 'final', '15', 'minutes', 'confusion', 'several', 'What', 'do/where', 'go', 'moments', 'are', 'worth', 'sticking', '1', 'hour/40', 'minutes', 'boredom', 'MAN', 'Why', 'wedding', 'have', 'dominate', 'first', 'half', 'What', 'purpose', 'serve', 'seriously', 'think', 'wedding', 'occurring', 'such', 'unusual', 'circumstances', 'abnormal', ""'re"", 'right', ""'d"", 'be', 'wedding', 'taking', 'place', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Not', 'least', 'bit', 'believable.The', 'film', 'laughably', 'splitting', 'up', 'story', 'two', 'separate', 'portions', 'two', 'separate', 'stories', 'involving', 'two', 'sisters', 'concept', 'honestly', 'wedding', 'first', 'part', 'truthfully', ""n't"", 'belong', 'such', 'film', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'movie', 'writers', 'felt', 'need', 'even', 'split', 'movie', 'two', 'separate', 'stories', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'writing', 'second', 'more', 'important', 'story', 'probably', 'wanted', 'add', 'fresh', 'twist', 'old', 'familiar', 'world', 'coming', 'end', 'plotline', 'NOT', 'kind', 'refreshment', ""'ve"", 'been', 'warned', 'one', 'folks', 'can', 'almost', 'gurantee', ""'re"", 'NOT', 'getting', 'what', 'think', 'are', 'Melancholia']",N/A
1498351,A84I17NNU1TFY,B005S9EI2Y,b,"[4, 6]","A lot of the reviews here that are one star are very troubling.  I'm reminded of the people who reportedly walked out of the theaters during Tree of Life, or Twilight fans posting book reviews of Stoker's Dracula or Tess of the d'Urbervilles (that was mentioned so frequently by the author of Twilight).I get it.  The movie is slow paced.  I get it.  The science fiction is a mere backdrop rather than the focus.But the movie is meant to explore an emotion, not merely state it.  It explores how severe depression really is.  It explores how those without depression react to tragedy and how those with it become numb to stress and tragedy.  It is slowly paced - but it does so to bring you to an emotional realization.There's nothing wrong with movies that are action and more highly paced in their drama.  But, for me, Melancholia - along with other incredibly cerebral science fiction like the Her or the UK televsion series, Black Mirror, are these scifi pieces that are really upping the game as far as art goes.  Too often is science fiction just the window dressing for dumb action movies.  Too often do supposedly adult drama mean to do nothing but over stimulate you and sell you a soap opera story.Very rarely does a piece get so intimate, require you to reflect upon the people and their situation without jarring you to the next situation and the next and the next.  In a world where society must constantly be forced to be over stimulated, this asks you to slow down to explore this one thing.And frankly - the one star reviews here say more about the reviewers, than they do the movie.The shooting locations and the capturing of them are just absolutely gorgeous, it's incredibly well acted and  the prelude to Richard Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde set the tone of the film perfectly.  My one petty complaint, is the naming of the planet.  The movie is aptly titled - but there was no real reason to actually name the planet crashing into earth that very thing.

It's not an action / adventure / disaster / science fiction movie. If you are looking for that type of movie, then seek out ARMAGEDDON, DEEP IMPACT, or WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE. Nope, this is Lars Von Trier's film about the insanity / fickleness of human emotions in the face of tragedy and loss. Yes, the Earth is in the path of a rogue planet named MELANCHOLIA, but this is more of a metaphor for what's happening to the characters on screen, than it is an actual event.

From the opening, hilarious drive in the stretch-limousine, to the wedding catastrophe, to the ultimate climax, MELANCHOLIA is an uncomfortable story.

The couple arrives two hours late for their own wedding ceremony! Disapprovingly, impatiently and anxiously, they are greeted by her sister Claire, played by the incomparable Charlotte Gainsbourg and Justine's curmudgeon of a brother in law John played by Kiefer Sutherland.Rounding out this brilliant cast of wedding celebrants are John Hurt, Charlotte Rampling and Stellan Skarsgrd.We instantly become wedding guests ourselves and are lead into the grand ballroom of the manor house for the proceedings. Much later, after the cake has been cut, all the guests are ushered outside onto the lawn to join in a charming tradition of writing congratulatory messages on small hot air balloon skins and sending them floating into the sparkling night sky. It was majickal!Lars gives us tiny glimpses at a time into this privileged, yet terribly dysfunctional family. An undercurrent of uneasiness and outright spoken hostility casts a dark shadow over the festivities as the bride and groom are toasted by estranged family members.Later, after all the guests have departed, Michael, soon learns that Justine has been barely holding herself together and is irrevocably damaged by major depression. She is incapable of any true relationship nor intimacy with him. Poor disillusioned Michael eventually packs his bag and leaves a broken man.As the clock ticktocks, Justine sinks deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole while Claire tries desperately to save her from the darkness while struggling with her own frailties and demons.By the time we discover the true meaning of MELANCHOLIA, John is having a crushing epiphany!

This review is different like the movie is itself.I have not seen any other ""LVT"" movies but I did read some reviews mentioning his other movies. I also noticed the dichotomy of reviews like a bell curve from 1-5 stars for this movie. I see clearly why that is.This movie is not aimed to please it's viewers. Most movies produced aim to please viewers and make them feel good and triumphant with a relaxed sense of relief and satisfaction, perhaps like a good meal. This movie uses the visual and musical mediums to provoke thought on a topic that most people have considered but have never experienced. Actually that statement is half true. It depends upon which part of the movie is referred to though it is all tied together.First I had not read any reviews before watching and was unsure if this was a sci-fi or some other type of movie but I saw the cast of actors and thought it's free on amazon with prime so I cannot loose too much by watching it on my computer. (I was wrong. I think I should have (and still will) see it on a better quality video source).This was the type of movie that you must have a blank slate brain to watch with no preconceptions of the topic. The topic is complex. I did forget my troubles of the day. The flow of the movie may seem confusing in the beginning but having patience I now understand the beauty and meaning of how this movie began. I fortunately had no one commenting about ""why did they...this and why did they that..."" I was able to absorb this artwork like a chef styles a complex meal, one course at a time actually one bite at a time with all senses engaged and with no desire to skip to desert. I almost want to see other movies by ""LVT"" but am a little skittish based on reviews. Perhaps I should have an open mind.If you have ever pondered the meaning of life or the end of life as we know it this will fascinate you. If you don't mind delving into answers to questions you most probably have refused to ask then watch this movie. If you are looking for a no brainer to escape the troubles of the day and make you feel good then bypass this movie for now. Give it a chance later.I personally was drawn into this and felt a parallel that is somewhat intimate and scary.

The title is fitting as it describes the condition of the two sisters played by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainesbourgh, but more so Dunst who is suffering from a depression ridden mental disorder and destroys any chance at happiness for her marriage on her wedding day.  You almost feel sorry for her, but can't quite completely do it.  She was far more sympathetic as Lux in the movie Virgin Suicides, which makes me believe that she and Sofia Coppola need to work together again.  They are a winning team when it comes to art films about women.2.  Melancholia is the name of the planet headed on a collision course for earth.  Though Gainesbourgh's character's husband played by Kieffer Sutherland has assured her that the planet will not hit and go around, we find out he discovers he was wrong in one of the most selfish acts a person could do to his family, which made me really angry with him.3.  Melancholia is exactly what you will feel as you sit through the entire 2 hours and 15 minutes of this depressing  film that tries hard to be art.  The beginning is beautiful, slow, colorful shots set to the background of classical music that is almost worth watching the movie for at all.  Other than that, this movie is slower than the intro, dreary, dismal, and makes you sad to see how Dunst's character is the stronger one in the end, taking charge of the situation as disaster looms.This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but I wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to anybody I know.  As much as I like the actors who were cast, this movie is simply not that great.  I think next time Dunst makes an art film, she should reunite with Sofia Coppola, as I've said before.

The people on Earth have no ability to alter their fate and must meet it however they can.In this movie, the person who can best meet such a disaster is Justine, the depressed sister of the high-strung over-achiever Claire.The movie starts at a wedding at Claire's posh digs.  Justine is entering into an episode of depression consequently breaks down on her wedding night, thus causing estrangement from those she should be loving towards.  As Justine's depression worsens, she must move in with Clair and her family to be cared for.The rogue planet-it's headed towards earth.  Initially, it is expected to fly by and head out to deep space but it ends up getting diverted by Earth's gravity and swings around for a collusion.

Thus, this movie was no mystery for us as melancholia is a state of emotional mood.  Kirsten Dunst is Melancholia personified right from the start of the movie, although it may not be apparent to most as she smiles a lot during her wedding reception. After meeting her parents, John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling, her state of emotional health should come as no surprise.Juxtaposed with this is the planet Melancholia which is on collision course with the earth. Although Keifer Sutherland, her brother-in-law, exudes false euphoria that we will avoid destruction by it, Dunst knows better because she accepts such sad facts more easily. She can see the end of the world easily because she is always perched on her own personal end of the world each day.Her sister, Charlotte Gainsborough, is initially convinced all will be well but she starts to unravel as the planet looms ever closer. As we move closer to the climax, the three central figures are the two sisters and the young son of the Gainsborough character.The imagery is exquisite throughout and the beginning of the film is an incredible montage of images which will all be covered by the film.Lars Von Trier is an acquired taste.  Do I like this as much as the first film of his I ever saw, ZENTROPA? No, but that isn't the point.  These are art films and it requires a different perceptual set to appreciate his work.

1498373,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B005S9EI2Y,CriticNic,"[3, 5]","Melancholia is Lars von Trier's first feature since 2009's Antichrist, which was one of my earlier reviews. That film had stimulated me both mentally and visually, and also left me wanting more from the director of whose work I had not been too familiar with prior. Melancholia was on point with my expectations, with the end result being a visually stunning and equally mentally engaging picture. Right from the opening montage containing Wagner's Tristan und Isolde Prelude layered over high-speed, slow-motion shots with dark, eerie yet magical visuals, the audience is hinted as to what is in store.The film follows Justine (Kirsten Dunst) as she and newly wed husband Michael (Alexander Skarsgrd) head to their wedding reception. Upon arrival to the absurdly enormous estate, owned by Justine's brother-in-law John (Kiefer Sutherland), Justine's attention is caught by a mysterious star in the sky. Justine's emotional state, which was previously played off so convincingly as happy and giddy during a humorous scene involving the bride and groom in a limousine on a tight country road, declines rapidly.The evening slowly proceeds with different interactions mostly involving Justine and various family and co-workers. Each of these situations gives us more insight into who Justine is and set the tone for the rest of the film. Justine's depressive state becomes more and more evident, which starts to become a foreshadowing of much larger events. When the celebration events end, so does Part I (entitled on screen as ""Justine"").Part II, entitled ""Claire,"" focuses more on Justine's older sister (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg). Claire is a loving yet somewhat controlling older sister to Justine who takes on a motherly like role with an ill Justine. During the second part, the planet known as Melancholia is now known to be approaching Earth and much time is focused on Claire's handling of the situation.The film is certainly more of an experience, or set of experiences, as seen through the eyes of our characters. Because of this, parts of the film are drawn out, which undoubtedly contributes greatly to character development but almost caused me to lose track of the actual story. We do get to know the main characters a great deal and Melancholia adds a whole different dimension to factor into everything that we're observing.From the get-go, we know this film is going to be a downer for the most part. Knowing that, how events and characters play out is still involving and mysterious. The performances are so profound in this film that it is near impossible to not have any feelings about each of the characters. The emotive music and usually artful cinematography (I say ""usually"" due to plentiful use of shakycam that I found to be less effective in several areas of the film) makes sure that the film has a lasting impact on the viewer.This really is a beautiful film. Like Antichrist, it plays on the mental state of its characters as well as the external environment. Melancholia also adds a bit of philosophical flare to make things even more engaging. Dunst also really sold the film for me. While I usually have a fairly neutral response to her, with All Good Things and now this, she's certainly someone to watch. I still just can't help but feel that the ""part"" structure of the film was almost unnecessary. Trier chose to spotlight Justine and Claire, however I feel this was achieved automatically without a need for the extra effort. A few directorial preferences aside, Melancholia stands out from most modern films and is truly a stunning experience.Source: criticnic.com 8-March-2012",4,Artsy yet thought-provoking story,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,3621,"['Melancholia', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'first', 'feature', '2009', 'Antichrist', 'was', 'one', 'earlier', 'reviews', 'film', 'had', 'stimulated', 'mentally', 'visually', 'also', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'director', 'work', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'too', 'familiar', 'prior', 'Melancholia', 'was', 'point', 'expectations', 'end', 'result', 'being', 'visually', 'stunning', 'equally', 'mentally', 'engaging', 'picture', 'Right', 'opening', 'montage', 'containing', 'Wagner', 'Tristan', 'und', 'Isolde', 'Prelude', 'layered', 'high-speed', 'slow-motion', 'shots', 'dark', 'eerie', 'yet', 'magical', 'visuals', 'audience', 'hinted', 'what', 'store.The', 'film', 'Justine', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'newly', 'wed', 'husband', 'Michael', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgrd', 'head', 'wedding', 'reception', 'arrival', 'absurdly', 'enormous', 'estate', 'owned', 'Justine', 'brother-in-law', 'John', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'Justine', 'attention', 'caught', 'mysterious', 'star', 'sky', 'Justine', 'emotional', 'state', 'was', 'previously', 'played', 'off', 'so', 'convincingly', 'happy', 'giddy', 'humorous', 'scene', 'involving', 'bride', 'groom', 'limousine', 'tight', 'country', 'road', 'rapidly.The', 'evening', 'slowly', 'proceeds', 'different', 'interactions', 'mostly', 'involving', 'Justine', 'various', 'family', 'co-workers', 'situations', 'more', 'insight', 'who', 'Justine', 'set', 'tone', 'rest', 'film', 'Justine', 'depressive', 'state', 'more', 'more', 'evident', 'become', 'foreshadowing', 'much', 'larger', 'events', 'When', 'celebration', 'events', 'end', 'so', 'Part', 'entitled', 'screen', 'Justine', '.Part', 'II', 'entitled', 'Claire', 'more', 'Justine', 'older', 'sister', 'played', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'Claire', 'loving', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'controlling', 'older', 'sister', 'Justine', 'who', 'motherly', 'role', 'ill', 'Justine', 'second', 'part', 'planet', 'known', 'Melancholia', 'now', 'known', 'be', 'approaching', 'Earth', 'much', 'time', 'focused', 'Claire', 'handling', 'situation.The', 'film', 'certainly', 'more', 'experience', 'set', 'experiences', 'seen', 'eyes', 'characters', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'drawn', 'out', 'undoubtedly', 'greatly', 'character', 'development', 'almost', 'caused', 'lose', 'track', 'actual', 'story', 'do', 'get', 'know', 'main', 'characters', 'great', 'deal', 'Melancholia', 'whole', 'different', 'dimension', 'factor', 'everything', ""'re"", 'get-go', 'know', 'film', 'going', 'be', 'downer', 'most', 'part', 'Knowing', 'how', 'events', 'characters', 'play', 'out', 'still', 'involving', 'mysterious', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'profound', 'film', 'near', 'impossible', 'not', 'have', 'feelings', 'characters', 'emotive', 'music', 'usually', 'artful', 'cinematography', 'say', 'usually', 'due', 'plentiful', 'use', 'shakycam', 'found', 'be', 'less', 'effective', 'several', 'areas', 'film', 'sure', 'film', 'lasting', 'impact', 'viewer.This', 'really', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Antichrist', 'mental', 'state', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'external', 'environment', 'Melancholia', 'also', 'bit', 'philosophical', 'flare', 'make', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'engaging', 'Dunst', 'also', 'really', 'sold', 'film', 'usually', 'have', 'fairly', 'neutral', 'response', 'Good', 'Things', 'now', 'certainly', 'someone', 'watch', 'still', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'part', 'structure', 'film', 'was', 'almost', 'unnecessary', 'Trier', 'chose', 'spotlight', 'Justine', 'Claire', 'however', 'feel', 'was', 'achieved', 'automatically', 'need', 'extra', 'effort', 'few', 'directorial', 'preferences', 'aside', 'Melancholia', 'out', 'most', 'modern', 'films', 'truly', 'stunning', 'experience.Source', 'criticnic.com', '8-March-2012']",N/A

1498376,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B005S9EI2Y,DanD,"[9, 12]","MELANCHOLIA begins with a wordless, operatic eight-minute sequence depicting the end of the world.  You should already be able to tell if you will like this movie or not.  But for you fence-riders out there...The first part focuses primarily upon Justine (Kirsten Dunst), who is celebrating her new marriage at her brother-in-law's (Keifer Sutherland) luxurious villa.  It starts out as basic wedding fodder--some humorous scenes between Justine and her new beau (Alexander Skarsgard), some strangely touching ones between her and her father (John Hurt)--before slowly disintegrating into the madness that we know to expect from Lars von Trier.  The second part of the film focuses more upon Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), as she copes with the knowledge that a strange planet called Melancholia is slowly approaching Earth.MELANCHOLIA is, at its heart, a chronicle of desperation (perfectly captured by Dunst, who gives a truly grave, often unsettling, performance).  It's also a film of the fantastic, a film that wears its bleakness on its sleeve.  While not as visually upsetting as Trier's previous film ANTICHRIST (about which I STILL have not made up my mind, except to say that it genuinely affected me), MELANCHOLIA contains some imagery that cuts straight to the core in both its beauty and its subtle horror.  The visuals are enhances by the film's performances, notably from Sutherland, the Skarsgards (Stellan and Alexander), Hurt, and Charlotte Rampling. (Look also for Udo Kier and Jesper Christensen, both underused).  Credit must also go to cinematographer Manuel Alberto Claro, and Trier's minimalist script.Ultimately, MELANCHOLIA falls into the same category as most of Trier's films: it will touch you or it won't.  I won't say love and hate; that's far too simple for a film of this magnitude.  MELANCHOLIA is a true work of art; whether it succeeds or fails depends entirely upon the individual viewer.

We spend so much of our time servicing our futures; I think it truly brilliant the way this movie made me think of a situation where nothing truly mattered anymore, not the past, not the present or the future, a tragically beautiful and frightening contemplation. Justine knows things, so she places Albrect Durers notable contemplation of everyday midaeval life on the shelf, so we can see when it is reduced to ashes by a planet named for one of his works (presumably named for one of his works), along with the world it contemplated. I thought Justines reaction very plausible, and it resonated with me. There have been times when I have been deeply depressed and, while not suicidal, thought that death was a blessing: finally an end to all of this constant struggle and pain.

It wasn't the film's length that had compelled me, a few weeks ago, to stop halfway through (I'm a sucker for long films), nor was it the subject matter or pacing.  I simply didn't care to find out how it all -- and I mean All -- ends.  You wouldn't think that a film depicting a vast planet hurtling towards Earth could be so lacking in drama, so dull and flaccid.  As the credits rolled, all I could think was...""That's it?""  Not to the end of the world, but the movie itself.  Perhaps that's von Trier's point, that once we're gone there'll be no-one to comment or reflect on the fact that we're gone.  The End will be the end.  But I couldn't help thinking that in the hands of a Bergman or a Bu&ntilde;uel, I'd be left with something to think about, some point of view to consider.  Von Trier does drop a hint now and then; one of the main characters says, ""The human race is evil, no-one will miss it.""  Okay, I guess.  But as she's a narcissistic, self-destructive drudge suffering from crippling depression, the statement doesn't have the impact it might coming from a rational, sensible person who's come to that conclusion after intelligent, soul searching meditation.  ""Melancholia,"" beautiful as it is to watch and professionally performed by its game cast, takes the easy way out.  Life is crap, so are People, boom, it's over and it's no big deal.

The first third of the film is taken up with an ensemble performance in which a high-society wedding goes horribly wrong, and this sequence in particular seemed studiously set in that art-film tradition -- a dark comedy of errors, packed with character details and observations that are both measured and abrasive. Nothing new here - nor anything particularly explosive. It's depressing, but not earth-shattering. Oh, pardon the pun... The rest of the film deals with the aftermath of the party, going small and closing in on the narrow family dynamics of two sisters at the center of the drama, which we discover is set in the backdrop of a metaphor-laden, moon-sized asteroid headed on a collision course with Earth. Yes, Lars Von Trier destroys the planet, and perhaps he does so with glee, but there is an evocative, imaginative element to this apocalypse, and it is nowhere near as repellant or pointless as the rape scene in his earlier work, ""Breaking The Waves,"" a movie that I actively detest.Though slow-moving and ponderous, this film is worth watching...

1498389,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B005S9EI2Y,Douglas King,"[267, 289]","""Melancholia"" may be the most accessible Lars Von Trier film I've ever seen. (However, for a director who often goes out of his way to alienate, repulse, and irritate his audience, that is not saying much.) ""Melancholia"" is beautifully shot and visually lovely to look at; gone is the difficult visual minimalism of films like ""Dogville"". Also gone is the gory brutality that is often part of Von Trier's films (especially his last film, ""Antichrist"".) ""Melancholia"" is a thoughtful, fascinating film told in two distinct, yet overlapping, parts.The first part, ""Justine"", is a realistic, sad family drama which tells the story of a young bride who implodes on her wedding day. Just married to a handsome man, promoted by her boss, and treated to a lavish party by her rich brother-in-law, Justine has every reason to be happy. Except she's not. Behind her forced smile, she's hiding a dark depression. By the end of the night Justine's depression, along with the selfishness and dysfunction of those around her, cause her to destroy both her brand new marriage and her career, and spiral into a dramatic depressive breakdown. Von Trier seems to have a deep interest in female protagonists who are being crushed by the expectations of those around them. In films like ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"", the characters were treated to sordid and gruesome abuse, but in the first half of ""Melancholia"", Justine is a more or less ordinary person suffering in a more conventional and relatable way.The second part of the film, ""Claire"", puts the focus on Justine's older sister. Claire is concerned about the reports in the news that a previously unknown planet, named Melancholia, will be passing close to the Earth's orbit. While most scientists believe that the planet will pass at a safe distance, there are those who also believe that an imminent collision will mean the end of the world. Claire's anxiety about the situation builds as the planet comes closer. Claire is also dealing with her sister's (Justine) post-wedding nervous breakdown. As the planet grows ever closer to Earth, the tension builds, until the characters are left to deal with the very real possibility that the world is going to end.By splitting the film up into two parts in this way, ""Melancholia"" explores the themes of loss, destruction, impermanence, and loneliness, first on an intimate scale (""Justine"") and then on a global scale (""Claire""). Although the film is provocative and often painful, it's more subtle and nuanced than any of Von Trier's other films I've seen, and perhaps more affective.",4,Loss,1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,2591,"['Melancholia', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'accessible', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'However', 'director', 'who', 'often', 'way', 'alienate', 'repulse', 'irritate', 'audience', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'Melancholia', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'visually', 'lovely', 'look', 'gone', 'difficult', 'visual', 'minimalism', 'films', 'Dogville', 'Also', 'gone', 'gory', 'brutality', 'often', 'part', 'Von', 'Trier', 'films', 'especially', 'last', 'film', 'Antichrist', 'Melancholia', 'thoughtful', 'fascinating', 'film', 'told', 'two', 'distinct', 'yet', 'overlapping', 'parts.The', 'first', 'part', 'Justine', 'realistic', 'sad', 'family', 'drama', 'story', 'young', 'bride', 'who', 'wedding', 'day', 'Just', 'married', 'handsome', 'man', 'promoted', 'boss', 'treated', 'lavish', 'party', 'rich', 'brother-in-law', 'Justine', 'reason', 'be', 'happy', 'not', 'forced', 'smile', 'hiding', 'dark', 'depression', 'end', 'night', 'Justine', 'depression', 'selfishness', 'dysfunction', 'cause', 'destroy', 'brand', 'new', 'marriage', 'career', 'spiral', 'dramatic', 'depressive', 'breakdown', 'Von', 'Trier', 'have', 'deep', 'interest', 'female', 'protagonists', 'who', 'are', 'being', 'crushed', 'expectations', 'films', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'characters', 'were', 'treated', 'sordid', 'gruesome', 'abuse', 'first', 'half', 'Melancholia', 'Justine', 'more', 'less', 'ordinary', 'person', 'suffering', 'more', 'conventional', 'relatable', 'way.The', 'second', 'part', 'film', 'Claire', 'focus', 'Justine', 'older', 'sister', 'Claire', 'concerned', 'reports', 'news', 'previously', 'unknown', 'planet', 'named', 'Melancholia', 'will', 'be', 'passing', 'close', 'Earth', 'orbit', 'most', 'scientists', 'believe', 'planet', 'will', 'pass', 'safe', 'distance', 'are', 'who', 'also', 'believe', 'imminent', 'collision', 'will', 'mean', 'end', 'world', 'Claire', 'anxiety', 'situation', 'planet', 'closer', 'Claire', 'also', 'dealing', 'sister', 'Justine', 'post-wedding', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'planet', 'ever', 'closer', 'Earth', 'tension', 'builds', 'characters', 'are', 'left', 'deal', 'very', 'real', 'possibility', 'world', 'going', 'end.By', 'splitting', 'film', 'up', 'two', 'parts', 'way', 'Melancholia', 'themes', 'loss', 'destruction', 'impermanence', 'loneliness', 'first', 'intimate', 'scale', 'Justine', 'then', 'global', 'scale', 'Claire', 'film', 'provocative', 'often', 'painful', 'more', 'subtle', 'nuanced', 'Von', 'Trier', 'other', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'perhaps', 'more', 'affective']",N/A
1498390,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B005S9EI2Y,Doug Park,"[2, 3]","MELANCHOLIA is a rather slow-moving, very European-flavored drama that is driven more by dialogue and nuance than it is by plot and tension: There is virtually no fast action or violence as we know it here. It does get a little draggy in places, like a long novel that takes its time with meticulous character development. Anyone who finds this description unappealing should probably avoid this one.Having said that, I found the acting--particularly that of the central ""depressive"" characters played by Dunst, Gainsbourg, and the young Cameron Spurr--quite outstanding. Combined with the painstaking cinematography and slow-burning but solid storyline, the result is a film that is amazing on many levels. MELANCHOLIA is a serious comedy that is different without being deliberately weird.Part I concerns itself with Justine (Dunst)'s wedding party at the lavish estate of her sister Claire (Gainsbourg). I won't tell you what happens, but some interesting stuff does. There is also finely embedded satire on the corporate world and familiar relations, with special focus on snooty rich people. The characters are all silly in their own special ways, making for a very fine human comedy.Part II is told from the point of view of Claire. A character who was quite dislikeable in Part I is humanized here. Claire's public rich girl front is believably gone, and the two sisters, apparently complete opposites in Part I, are shown to be very much alike. On this note, the theme in the title becomes evident. Claire's son Leo (Spurr) becomes a kindred spirit with his mother and aunt as the rogue planet Melancholia (to be taken literally, metaphorically, or both) approaches Earth. Once again, some intriguing stuff happens, ending with a climax that is predictable but apropos.",4,"""When Are We Going to Build Caves Together?""",1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2013,1777,"['MELANCHOLIA', 'rather', 'slow-moving', 'very', 'European-flavored', 'drama', 'driven', 'more', 'dialogue', 'nuance', 'plot', 'tension', 'virtually', 'fast', 'action', 'violence', 'know', 'here', 'get', 'little', 'draggy', 'places', 'long', 'novel', 'time', 'meticulous', 'character', 'development', 'Anyone', 'who', 'description', 'unappealing', 'should', 'probably', 'avoid', 'one.Having', 'said', 'found', 'acting', 'particularly', 'central', 'depressive', 'characters', 'played', 'Dunst', 'Gainsbourg', 'young', 'Cameron', 'Spurr', 'quite', 'outstanding', 'Combined', 'painstaking', 'cinematography', 'slow-burning', 'solid', 'storyline', 'result', 'film', 'amazing', 'many', 'levels', 'MELANCHOLIA', 'serious', 'comedy', 'different', 'being', 'deliberately', 'weird.Part', 'concerns', 'Justine', 'Dunst', 'wedding', 'party', 'lavish', 'estate', 'sister', 'Claire', 'Gainsbourg', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'also', 'finely', 'embedded', 'satire', 'corporate', 'world', 'familiar', 'relations', 'special', 'focus', 'snooty', 'rich', 'people', 'characters', 'are', 'silly', 'own', 'special', 'ways', 'making', 'very', 'fine', 'human', 'comedy.Part', 'II', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'Claire', 'A', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'quite', 'dislikeable', 'Part', 'humanized', 'here', 'Claire', 'public', 'rich', 'girl', 'front', 'believably', 'gone', 'two', 'sisters', 'apparently', 'complete', 'opposites', 'Part', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'alike', 'note', 'theme', 'title', 'evident', 'Claire', 'son', 'Leo', 'Spurr', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'mother', 'aunt', 'rogue', 'planet', 'Melancholia', 'be', 'taken', 'literally', 'metaphorically', 'Earth', 'Once', 'again', 'intriguing', 'stuff', 'happens', 'ending', 'climax', 'predictable', 'apropos']",N/A

1498395,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,B005S9EI2Y,Edmonson,"[5, 8]","""Melancholia"" (2011) is directed and written by Lars von Trier (Anti-Christ, Dancer in the Dark, Dogville). The movie is set in a timeless future on a wealthy estate during a wedding party just before the Earth is about to collide with the rogue planet called Melancholia. The film opens with a long slow motion sequence that depicts the ""Dance of Death"" of the two planets, and the principle characters in the film. The movie is then divided in two parts based on each of the two sisters: Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), as they deal with their difficulties and realizations about themselves, the people around them, and their bleak future. The film is a memorable and striking commentary about disenchantment with one's life, and facing one's imminent mortality.The blu-ray has numerous special features, including the making of the film, about the special effects, and visual style.",4,Facing mortality...,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,912,"['Melancholia', '2011', 'directed', 'written', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'Anti-Christ', 'Dancer', 'Dark', 'Dogville', 'movie', 'set', 'timeless', 'future', 'wealthy', 'estate', 'wedding', 'party', 'just', 'Earth', 'collide', 'rogue', 'planet', 'called', 'Melancholia', 'film', 'long', 'slow', 'motion', 'sequence', 'Dance', 'Death', 'two', 'planets', 'principle', 'characters', 'film', 'movie', 'then', 'divided', 'two', 'parts', 'based', 'two', 'sisters', 'Justine', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Claire', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'deal', 'difficulties', 'realizations', 'people', 'bleak', 'future', 'film', 'memorable', 'striking', 'commentary', 'disenchantment', 'one', 'life', 'facing', 'one', 'imminent', 'mortality.The', 'blu-ray', 'numerous', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'making', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'visual', 'style']",N/A
1498396,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B005S9EI2Y,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","Armageddon is given a surrealistic, chaotic and thoroughly avant-garde treatment that only Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier (Breaking the Waves) can give such a grave subject. This is no Michael Bay-style extravaganza of bombastic special effects but rather a brooding mood piece that is bound to frustrate as much as it impresses, quite often in the same scene due to von Trier's emotionally jarring, uniquely idiosyncratic perspective. At the same time, this 2011 drama is probably his most accessible work for a mass audience, even if it amounts to a study in psychological depression. The narrative splits evenly into two parts revolving around the lives of two sisters, Justine and Claire, on a large estate owned by Claire and her no-nonsense husband John.The first part, entitled simply ""Justine"", is about her elaborate wedding to Michael on the estate and how their reception deteriorates into emotional chaos and deception. Initially, Justine appears to be a carefree bride, but she turns out to be a rising creative director at an ad agency gradually revealing herself to be a manic-depressive on a path toward self-destruction. This part of the film is filled with von Trier's penchant for shaky hand-held camera shots and awkward confrontation scenes that turn the party into a social apocalypse. The second half, entitled ""Claire"", carries forth the natural consequence of the failed wedding with Justine in a catatonic state and now within the context of the impending collision of a rogue planet called Melancholia. The inevitability of the situation causes the sisters to transform their natures relative to each other - Justine changes from fatalistic to near-spiritual, while Claire moves from protective and insular to uncontrollably fearful.As with several of his more renowned films, von Trier has assembled an eclectic cast of actors whose differing accents would come across as puzzling if this was not clearly one of his ensemble films. Keeping a relatively low profile of late, Kirsten Dunst delivers a powerful, sometimes unsettling performance as Justine, a near-impossible role that takes advantage of her combination of unforced winsomeness and singular introspection. Looking nothing like Dunst, Charlotte Gainsbourg (Antichrist) is watchful in the more restrained role of Claire even as her character spins out of control toward the end. As her patronizing husband John, Kiefer Sutherland has to play close to the vest exuding contrived optimism in the face of insurmountable odds. Charlotte Rampling and John Hurt make their few moments count as the sisters' emotionally disconnected parents.Stellan Skarsgrd shows up as Justine's manipulative boss, and his real-life son Alexander plays Justine's smitten betrothed. It's interesting to note that Pen&eacute;lope Cruz was originally slated for Dunst's role, but her delayed schedule onPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tidesprevented her participation and yet another accent to the hodgepodge already presented. The film feels overlong at 135 minutes, especially with von Trier's often lugubrious pacing, but his cinematic artistry is in full bloom in the hallucinatory introductory sequence of images which initially confound but then reveal all too clearly where the story is going, all to the strains of Wagner's Prelude to ""Tristan and Isolde"". The ending is handled with surprising subtlety and poignancy. This movie will not be everyone's cup of tea (which may explain its appearance on Direct TV prior to its theatrical release), but the more patient and thoughtful among us will be rewarded.",4,Apocalyptic Saga of Two Sisters in von Trier's Idiosyncratic Hands,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",2011,3585,"['Armageddon', 'given', 'surrealistic', 'chaotic', 'thoroughly', 'avant-garde', 'treatment', 'only', 'Danish', 'filmmaker', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'Breaking', 'Waves', 'can', 'give', 'such', 'grave', 'subject', 'Michael', 'Bay-style', 'extravaganza', 'bombastic', 'special', 'effects', 'rather', 'brooding', 'mood', 'piece', 'bound', 'frustrate', 'as', 'much', 'quite', 'often', 'same', 'scene', 'due', 'von', 'Trier', 'emotionally', 'jarring', 'uniquely', 'idiosyncratic', 'perspective', 'same', 'time', '2011', 'drama', 'probably', 'most', 'accessible', 'work', 'mass', 'audience', 'even', 'study', 'psychological', 'depression', 'narrative', 'splits', 'evenly', 'two', 'parts', 'revolving', 'lives', 'two', 'sisters', 'Justine', 'Claire', 'large', 'estate', 'owned', 'Claire', 'no-nonsense', 'husband', 'John.The', 'first', 'part', 'entitled', 'simply', 'Justine', 'elaborate', 'wedding', 'Michael', 'estate', 'how', 'reception', 'emotional', 'chaos', 'deception', 'Initially', 'Justine', 'be', 'carefree', 'bride', 'out', 'be', 'rising', 'creative', 'director', 'ad', 'agency', 'gradually', 'revealing', 'be', 'manic-depressive', 'path', 'self-destruction', 'part', 'film', 'filled', 'von', 'Trier', 'penchant', 'shaky', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'shots', 'awkward', 'confrontation', 'scenes', 'turn', 'party', 'social', 'apocalypse', 'second', 'half', 'entitled', 'Claire', 'forth', 'natural', 'consequence', 'failed', 'wedding', 'Justine', 'catatonic', 'state', 'now', 'context', 'impending', 'collision', 'rogue', 'planet', 'called', 'Melancholia', 'inevitability', 'situation', 'sisters', 'transform', 'natures', 'relative', 'other', 'Justine', 'changes', 'fatalistic', 'near-spiritual', 'Claire', 'protective', 'insular', 'uncontrollably', 'fearful.As', 'several', 'more', 'renowned', 'films', 'von', 'Trier', 'assembled', 'eclectic', 'cast', 'actors', 'differing', 'accents', 'would', 'come', 'puzzling', 'was', 'not', 'clearly', 'one', 'ensemble', 'films', 'Keeping', 'relatively', 'low', 'profile', 'late', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'powerful', 'sometimes', 'unsettling', 'performance', 'Justine', 'near-impossible', 'role', 'advantage', 'combination', 'unforced', 'winsomeness', 'singular', 'introspection', 'Looking', 'nothing', 'Dunst', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'Antichrist', 'watchful', 'more', 'restrained', 'role', 'Claire', 'even', 'character', 'control', 'end', 'patronizing', 'husband', 'John', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'play', 'close', 'vest', 'exuding', 'contrived', 'optimism', 'face', 'insurmountable', 'odds', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'John', 'Hurt', 'make', 'few', 'moments', 'count', 'sisters', 'emotionally', 'disconnected', 'parents.Stellan', 'Skarsgrd', 'up', 'Justine', 'manipulative', 'boss', 'real-life', 'son', 'Alexander', 'Justine', 'smitten', 'betrothed', 'interesting', 'note', 'Pen', 'eacute', 'Cruz', 'was', 'originally', 'slated', 'Dunst', 'role', 'delayed', 'schedule', 'onPirates', 'Caribbean', 'Stranger', 'Tidesprevented', 'participation', 'yet', 'accent', 'hodgepodge', 'already', 'presented', 'film', 'feels', 'overlong', '135', 'minutes', 'especially', 'von', 'Trier', 'often', 'lugubrious', 'pacing', 'cinematic', 'artistry', 'full', 'bloom', 'hallucinatory', 'introductory', 'sequence', 'images', 'initially', 'confound', 'then', 'reveal', 'too', 'clearly', 'where', 'story', 'going', 'strains', 'Wagner', 'Prelude', 'Tristan', 'Isolde', 'ending', 'handled', 'surprising', 'subtlety', 'poignancy', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'may', 'explain', 'appearance', 'Direct', 'TV', 'prior', 'theatrical', 'release', 'more', 'patient', 'thoughtful', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded']",N/A

This movie had some fantastic moments, almost genius... brilliant and astonishing. There are lessons here to be learned in the layers of situations. How we as humans manipulate and have expectations of each other and how we react when those expectations aren't met. We realize that people are only and I mean ONLY being nice to you because they want something from you. ( that's right, honey badger don't give a #$@&! ). But seriously, what was the symbolism of the horse or the golf cart not crossing the bridge? Was there something symbolic of the limo being stuck on the curved road? Was the marriage a symbolism of failed unity and then the planets hitting one another a symbolism of destructive unity? What on earth was the mother wearing to the reception, a tie-dyed dress? How do a bunch of tree branches equate a magic cave? Why did one sister have an English accent and the other didn't? See, LOTS of questions. The song ""When Worlds Collide"" comes to mind.

I'll explain why I was profoundly disappointed.This is true for the last ten minutes or so of the film.  The rest has very little to do with depression, and although as some reviewers have noted, there is some impressive craftsmanship and the visuals are striking from the standpoint of cinematography, the writing of the characters is, in my opinion, trite and awful.  Based on my own experience of clinical depression, the main character's depression ends up taking a back seat to her being an awful person about halfway through the movie; depression, like any other traumatic experience, does not actually cause people to behave awfully.The movie obviously wants her to be sympathetic, by surrounding her with awful people and then presenting her in a quasi-mystical role akin to a postmodern version of the Mad Prophet, but she turns out at the most crucial moments to be steeped in unnecessary and pointless cruelty.  Her character seems less like a depressed person, and more like how depressed people are seen by people who don't understand them, lashing out and committing self-destructive acts ""at random.""  Combined with all the rest of the characters, with one or two exceptions, this makes the film seem like it's just one more brick in the wall of the postmodern paradigm: that everyone is awful, despicable, and crazy, and that adults throwing tantrums at one another like small children equals depth.The two stars are for the cinematography.  There are some beautiful visuals, especially in the beginning, although most of them end up having practically nothing to do with the actual events of the movie; this is a shame, since it probably would have been a better one.  It gets a bit TOO slow in places, but the patient building of atmosphere is expertly accomplished.

Ditto for her ex, who's crushed on arrival by her interruption. Stellan Skarsgaard's character is set up as the archvillain, then sent packing along with the other would-be antagonists (the  paramour, the business partners, and  the mother) halfway through what usually amounts to the first act in a feature film.It matters that the man of finance, order and science (the brother-in-law) miscalculates with a glib, unsatisfying nod to the uncertainty principle, then winds up kicked in the head by a horse. It matters too that the earnest, tender characters--the groom and the sister--are unfailingly inarticulate and/or dead wrong when it counts, because they both want storytelling progressions (gestures that suggest hope for the future, and actions that improve on the present) that the premise of the film won't tolerate.The constraint of that premise is why Kirsten Dunst swings from confection to wrecking ball in a few implausible filmed minutes--she ruins her world on her wedding night, quickly devolving from picture-perfect high society bride to washed-out bedhead gloomy girl who can't be bothered to wear makeup or flattering clothes. The first suggestion of the film is that she's right to have imploded--when the end is undeniable, that fact crowds out any fiction, regardless of motive.But the second suggestion of Melancholia matters more, I think, though it arrives only in the last minutes of the film.When the total resignation of Dunst's Justine has overtaken her sister Clare (and yes, look at those names again, and consider their blood ties), the spell of facts and hopelessness is broken by the fear of Clare's little boy, and the love both women have for him. The three join together to create one last fiction--one that gives them something to do in the final hours. It brings them together across generational, intellectual, and spiritual divides, in spite of their physical circumstances. The child may be assuaged by an illusion of hope, but the women, who have been at odds for the entire film, come to the same place in the end: it was bad fiction (not fiction itself) that led them astray. Their final act of imagination is a meaningful one, because the two women (for once) conjure it for all the right reasons. And the film ends beautifully and tragically, with the idea that fiction matters most when reality holds all the cards. What Clare and Justine give themselves and the child isn't denial, transcendence or control, but a way of putting themselves in accord with the end. Imagination brings them peace.If you're a fictionhead, the way this film gets where it wants to go demands repeat viewings.

1498415,A328S9RN3U5M68,B005S9EI2Y,Grady Harp,"[9, 12]","Lars von Trier is a master in creating films that jar the audience into a different level of perception.  His films (Dogville, Dancing in the Dark, Europa, AntiChrist, Breaking the Waves) explore the use of stage sets as though we were in the legitimate theater instead of a movie theater, uses the camera in a fashion that makes allows the viewer the feeling that we are overhearing or secretly observing of the characters the actors are portraying, writes stories that seduce us to think vertically instead of horizontally, and paints his films with music that is unexpectedly poignant to his story. Such is the case with MELANCHOLIA, a film that is yet to be released, one that likely will have a small audience in the art film houses, but at the same time for those fortunate enough to see this work of cinematic art it will jolt into the realm of possibilities about the end of life as we know it.The film opens the way it ends: a planet named Melancholia hidden by our sun circles into the earth's atmosphere and collides with earth.  The extended opening sequence is carried out is gorgeous pictures that reveal a tranquil stage set as the strange collision takes place - all to the Prelude to Wagner's 'Tristan und Isolde' (beautifully played by the Prague Philharmonic with some arranging from music director Kristian Eidnes Andersen).  The two hour film is dived into Part one: Justine and Part two: Claire.  Once the action begins we discover Justine (Kirsten Dunst) - in full bridal regalia - and her husband Michael (Alexander Skarsgrd) attempting to manipulate a wedding limousine to the mansion where Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) and their little son Leo (Cameron Spurr) have been waiting for hours to begin the vastly expensive wedding party. Present at the party are Dexter (John Hurt) this discombobulated father of the sisters, the girl's vitriolic mother Gaby (Charlotte Rampling), Justine's boss Jack (Stellan Skarsgrd), a new speech writer for Jack's company Tim (Brady Corbet), Michael's parents (James Cagnard and Deborah Fronko) and the wedding planner and assistant (Udo Kier and Jesper Christensen).  The party is tense and we slowly realize that Justine is 'distracted': she seems to be suffering from a form of melancholia and spends her time at the party unwisely (a physical encounter in the garden with Tim, napping, and always at odds with Claire and John, and eventually wandering off to be alone, away from Michael.  There is a new star in the sky that the people dismiss but that some say is a planet headed in a collision course with the earth.  In Part two we find Justine being returned to Claire's home, disheveled, and the relationship of the sisters is more fully explored.  There is an air of anxiety - the time of the predicted collision is approaching and the manner in which all observe what follows is at once terrifying and eloquently meaningful.The entire cast is brilliant. Many viewers may find this film a preposterous apocalyptic vision, many will see it as an overly long and self indulgent artsy piece by von Trier, but the beauty of the film is not only in the visual aspects and the musical aspects of the production but in the intensely realistic view of a truly dysfunctional family - and perhaps that is the driving force of the collision of relationships as we currently view them that merely marry the metaphor of Justine's melancholia with the incipient act of the strange planet Melancholia's collision with earth.  Do we care to mend our existence, or do we passively wait for the consequences of now?

Is there a middle ground?  Well, before I found myself assigning it five stars, I thought maybe *I* was at precisely that place.  I liked much of it, while watching it, but did kind of succumb to its longueurs at various places.  I also couldn't HEAR much of the dialogue, which doesn't seem like such a problem at most movies, so I doubt I have a hearing issue (at least I hope not--with my luck I'd just get a decent hearing aid and then some rogue planet would come crashing into the Earth and making it all for naught anyway).I'm enough of a literalist that I can't sit through a movie that casts a (very) American actress (Kirsten Dunst)and (veddy) Franco-British one (Charlotte Gainsbourg) as sisters and not grumble at least a bit thatWh no one's even BOTHERING to attempt to match accents (let alone their  and overall demeanor).  We see that they have a British mother (Charlotte Rampling--Yay!)and a dad who seems so out of it, it's hard to tell (but the actor--John Hurt--is, of course, British).

Not if the world is coming to an end.Which, ultimately of course, makes ALL the difference.  People who accuse von Trier of meandering are not totally off base, but they are missing a basic point, I think.  We've all seen at least some of those end-of-the-world movies and have witnessed the hysteria that attends anticipated annihilation.  MELANCHOLIA has a different mood, and it is--you guessed it--a melancholy one.  Melancholia is the name of the ""blue planet"" hurtling toward Earth.  It is also the overriding mental state of the film's main character, Justine (Dunst), who seems to be picking up on the destructive vibe well before anyone else is even aware of the impending crisis.Is she supernaturally sensitive to the cosmic vibe, or has she always been in a precarious mental state anyway?  Her parents are total screw ups, and her relationship with her wealthy sister and brother-in-law seems rather fragmented and would seem to have a long history of major and minor conflicts.  If she's in a bad way, well, she has her reasons.Unlike the typical All-American, big budget disaster film, MELANCHOLIA is relatively low-key, and all the more ominous for it. If it's a technically a ""disaster film,"" it's the most poetic, most haunting one since, at least, THE LAST WAVE. In Part I, we see that a few of the characters notice something strange in the night sky,  but it's explained away by someone who seems authoritative enough.  The rest of the first part is devoted to the disastrous wedding reception,  a debacle so understandable in human terms that we only later realize that this time out, the fault may indeed lay as much in the stars as in ourselves.Weddings, new beginnings, none of that can matter much now.  It is only in Part II that we learn that despite some optimistic predictions that the rogue planet (which has been hiding behind the sun lo these many millennia) may only be a ""fly by"" (like it was w/ Mercury and Venus, we're told).  But we know better, the prologue told us as much.Lucky for us, we don't have to contend with the panic scenes in urban centers or suburban tracts.  In the final scenes, we observe only the two sisters, Justine and Claire, and Claire's young son, isolated on the latter's rural estate.  No marauding hoards have descended, but what of it?  Total destruction faces them--and everyone--no matter what.  Still, we see a different kind of doomsday scenario.  The world ends with a bang AND a whimper.Released in 2011,  MELANCHOLIA may well be the perfect film to usher in 2012's ""count down.""  But even if that's not your eschatalogical beat or bent, you may find yourself thinking about this film for days or weeks after seeing it.  It's haunting in the way that TREE OF LIFE is haunting.  Not for everyone, of course, but for those whose tastes in cinema lean toward the darkly poetic (and you know who you are), '11 has proven to be something of a banner year.",5,Don't They Know It's The End of The World...,1325116800,"12 29, 2011",2011,4272,"['probably', 'accurate', 'say', 'MELANCHOLIA', 'love', 'hate', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'customer', 'reviews', 'are', 'indication', 'almost', 'certainly', 'case', 'there', 'middle', 'ground', 'Well', 'found', 'assigning', 'five', 'stars', 'thought', 'maybe', '*I*', 'was', 'precisely', 'place', 'liked', 'much', 'watching', 'did', 'kind', 'succumb', 'longueurs', 'various', 'places', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'HEAR', 'much', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'seem', 'problem', 'most', 'movies', 'doubt', 'have', 'hearing', 'issue', 'least', 'hope', 'not', 'luck', ""'d"", 'just', 'get', 'decent', 'hearing', 'aid', 'then', 'rogue', 'planet', 'would', 'come', 'crashing', 'Earth', 'making', 'naught', 'anyway', '.I', ""'m"", 'enough', 'literalist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'movie', 'very', 'American', 'actress', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'veddy', 'Franco-British', 'one', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'sisters', 'not', 'grumble', 'least', 'bit', 'thatWh', 'one', 'even', 'BOTHERING', 'attempt', 'match', 'accents', 'let', 'alone', 'overall', 'demeanor', 'see', 'have', 'British', 'mother', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'Yay', 'dad', 'who', 'so', 'hard', 'tell', 'actor', 'John', 'Hurt', 'course', 'British', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'English', 'speakers', 'sound', 'alike', 'Danish', 'director', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'No', 'knew', 'what', 'mismatch', 'was', ""N'T"", 'care', 'why', 'should', 'he/we', 'Not', 'world', 'coming', 'end.Which', 'ultimately', 'course', 'difference', 'People', 'who', 'accuse', 'von', 'Trier', 'meandering', 'are', 'not', 'totally', 'base', 'are', 'missing', 'basic', 'point', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'least', 'end-of-the-world', 'movies', 'have', 'witnessed', 'hysteria', 'anticipated', 'annihilation', 'MELANCHOLIA', 'different', 'mood', 'guessed', 'melancholy', 'one', 'Melancholia', 'name', 'blue', 'planet', 'hurtling', 'Earth', 'also', 'overriding', 'mental', 'state', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'Justine', 'Dunst', 'who', 'be', 'picking', 'up', 'destructive', 'vibe', 'well', 'anyone', 'else', 'even', 'aware', 'impending', 'crisis.Is', 'supernaturally', 'sensitive', 'cosmic', 'vibe', 'always', 'been', 'precarious', 'mental', 'state', 'anyway', 'parents', 'are', 'total', 'screw', 'ups', 'relationship', 'wealthy', 'sister', 'brother-in-law', 'rather', 'fragmented', 'would', 'seem', 'have', 'long', 'history', 'major', 'minor', 'conflicts', 'bad', 'way', 'well', 'reasons.Unlike', 'typical', 'All-American', 'big', 'budget', 'disaster', 'film', 'MELANCHOLIA', 'relatively', 'low-key', 'more', 'ominous', 'technically', 'disaster', 'film', 'most', 'poetic', 'most', 'haunting', 'one', 'least', 'LAST', 'WAVE', 'Part', 'see', 'few', 'characters', 'notice', 'something', 'strange', 'night', 'sky', 'explained', 'away', 'someone', 'who', 'authoritative', 'enough', 'rest', 'first', 'part', 'devoted', 'disastrous', 'wedding', 'reception', 'debacle', 'so', 'understandable', 'human', 'terms', 'only', 'later', 'realize', 'time', 'out', 'fault', 'may', 'indeed', 'lay', 'as', 'much', 'stars', 'ourselves.Weddings', 'new', 'beginnings', 'none', 'can', 'matter', 'much', 'now', 'only', 'Part', 'II', 'learn', 'optimistic', 'predictions', 'rogue', 'planet', 'been', 'hiding', 'sun', 'many', 'millennia', 'may', 'only', 'be', 'fly', 'was', 'w/', 'Mercury', 'Venus', ""'re"", 'told', 'know', 'better', 'prologue', 'told', 'much.Lucky', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'contend', 'panic', 'scenes', 'urban', 'centers', 'suburban', 'tracts', 'final', 'scenes', 'observe', 'only', 'two', 'sisters', 'Justine', 'Claire', 'Claire', 'young', 'son', 'isolated', 'latter', 'rural', 'estate', 'No', 'marauding', 'hoards', 'have', 'descended', 'what', 'Total', 'destruction', 'everyone', 'matter', 'what', 'Still', 'see', 'different', 'kind', 'doomsday', 'scenario', 'world', 'bang', 'whimper.Released', '2011', 'MELANCHOLIA', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'perfect', 'film', 'usher', '2012', 'count', 'down', 'even', 'not', 'eschatalogical', 'beat', 'bent', 'may', 'find', 'thinking', 'film', 'days', 'weeks', 'seeing', 'haunting', 'way', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'haunting', 'Not', 'everyone', 'course', 'tastes', 'cinema', 'lean', 'darkly', 'poetic', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'proven', 'be', 'something', 'banner', 'year']",N/A

There is also an end - of - earth situation which is running parallel to her story of being unhealthy. Amidst all this there is a bad relationship between two sisters which is rather uncomfortable to watch. The climax is finally when things get into motion and what happens is well...justified?But the whole affair seemed really pointless. It was not even arty or fun to watch.

Marriage and a big promotion surrounded by family and friends. Or did she? As the movie unravels, we find out she was suffering from a crushing depression. Why? Depression is the most mysterious and spiritual of illnesses. Terrible but a gift more often than not. Contemp psychology posits many valid theories which contribute to it. They all tell part of the story. This movie suggests another part. A spiritual accumulation of selfishness, emptiness, lack of meaning, lack of value and lack of connection on a global scale. Perhaps suggesting, we all inhale psychically from the spiritual 'air' of the world. Of a collective consciousness. Of the intent behind random interactions. Of other's thoughts directed toward us. Of our thoughts directed toward them. Of slights, accumulated grievances, unresolved fights, etc Perhaps there is a global mood of which we all partake to some degree. When combined with personal 'evils' it resonates and coagulates into something dark, chronic and foreboding. A gray cloud that refuses to go away. Like air pollution. Spiritual energy works similarly. It sounds archaic but many cultures who were more communally and spiritually connected have posited similar narratives along these lines. Depression often does not make entire sense in its context. With the stories we tell in psychologists offices. They always fall short in explaining why.

The concept was interesting too, a severely depressed character has an opposite reaction compared to the 'happy' and 'balanced' people in her lives when they are thrust into two emotionally contrasting events, a visual aid for the concept would be a yin-yang symbol.But when it comes to the plot Lars Von Trier again struggles to maintain the audience's interest. Here he splits the film into two chapters, the first half is called Justine and and shows Justine(Kirsten Dunst) is depressed, and it's effecting the people around her during her own wedding dinner to the point where the whole wedding unravels by the end of the night, which was really boring to watch when it shouldn't have been. Who are these people aqain? Why are we supposed to care about Justine's passive aggressive temper tantrum? For someone who's actually depressed, Lars sure doesn't know how to convey it well in film. The whole wedding dinner experience is like being stuck in a distant cousin's wedding where you don't know/care about anyone there and you can't drink.Another bad decision on Lar's part was the camera work, it looks like the camera-man suddenly became violently ill and started puking while trying to hold the camera on the scene, and it just looks like a disaster. Was this supposed to be a hand-held Cloverfield knock-off? I'm not sure if it was supposed to be 'artsy' or 'cute' but it was just a pointless distraction from the already uninteresting story. After seeing the first ten minutes this part was quite a letdown.Thankfully the second half picks things up, this time revolving around Justine's sister Claire in the chapter named (you guessed it) Claire. Claire realizes along with the rest of the family that an asteroid aptly named ""Melancholia"" is on course for Earth, and is days away from global annihilation. Each of the characters kind of reacts in their own way, the most peculiar being Justine, knowing that everyone's doom is imminent she becomes strangely calm while Claire is frantically struggling to escape certain doom along with her daughter. The second half is a bit more interesting, but still there wasn't really a sense of dread set up. I couldn't really relate or care about any of these characters, the only really interesting aspect about the story is again seeing how one of the characters with depression cope with marriage and death. At it's best, Melancholia is both beautiful and emotionally devastating (you really have to meet Lars half way to get that out of Melancholia) and at it's worst is bloated and pretentious.Lars Von Trier has a good visual eye, but his screenwriting and editing are sloppy. Lars could've easily cut down the length or add more to what's going on. But like Antichrist Lars sure loves to have his characters depressed, but he hasn't really found a way to convey it. Unlike Antichrist there is more going on here and there's a real sense of beauty to it all that doesn't have to resort to unnecessary and dumb gore.It's worth mentioning that the director conceited this film while in therapy for depression, the main actress Kirsten Dunst has openly admitted to suffering from depression, and the whole film revolves around how depression effects everyone, so I'd only recommend this film to people interested in depression.",2,Beautifully Boring,1335916800,"05 2, 2012",2012,3549,"['2.5', 'care.Melancholia', 'undeniably', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'images', 'space', 'are', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'breasts', 'were', 'beautiful', 'music', 'was', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'slow', 'motion', 'was', 'especially', 'breathtaking', 'concept', 'was', 'interesting', 'too', 'severely', 'depressed', 'character', 'opposite', 'reaction', 'compared', ""'happy"", ""'balanced"", 'people', 'lives', 'when', 'are', 'thrust', 'two', 'emotionally', 'contrasting', 'events', 'visual', 'aid', 'concept', 'would', 'be', 'yin-yang', 'symbol.But', 'when', 'plot', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'again', 'maintain', 'audience', 'interest', 'Here', 'film', 'two', 'chapters', 'first', 'half', 'called', 'Justine', 'Justine', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'depressed', 'effecting', 'people', 'own', 'wedding', 'dinner', 'point', 'where', 'whole', 'wedding', 'unravels', 'end', 'night', 'was', 'really', 'boring', 'watch', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'Who', 'are', 'people', 'aqain', 'Why', 'are', 'supposed', 'care', 'Justine', 'passive', 'aggressive', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'depressed', 'sure', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'convey', 'well', 'film', 'whole', 'wedding', 'dinner', 'experience', 'being', 'stuck', 'distant', 'cousin', 'wedding', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'know/care', 'anyone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drink.Another', 'bad', 'decision', 'Lar', 'part', 'was', 'camera', 'work', 'camera-man', 'suddenly', 'became', 'violently', 'ill', 'started', 'puking', 'trying', 'hold', 'camera', 'scene', 'just', 'disaster', 'Was', 'supposed', 'be', 'hand-held', 'Cloverfield', 'knock-off', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', ""'artsy"", 'was', 'just', 'pointless', 'distraction', 'already', 'uninteresting', 'story', 'seeing', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'part', 'was', 'quite', 'letdown.Thankfully', 'second', 'half', 'picks', 'things', 'up', 'time', 'revolving', 'Justine', 'sister', 'Claire', 'chapter', 'named', 'guessed', 'Claire', 'Claire', 'rest', 'family', 'asteroid', 'aptly', 'named', 'Melancholia', 'course', 'Earth', 'days', 'away', 'global', 'annihilation', 'characters', 'kind', 'reacts', 'own', 'way', 'most', 'peculiar', 'being', 'Justine', 'knowing', 'everyone', 'doom', 'imminent', 'strangely', 'calm', 'Claire', 'frantically', 'struggling', 'escape', 'certain', 'doom', 'daughter', 'second', 'half', 'bit', 'more', 'interesting', 'still', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'sense', 'dread', 'set', 'up', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'relate', 'care', 'characters', 'only', 'really', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'story', 'again', 'seeing', 'how', 'one', 'characters', 'depression', 'cope', 'marriage', 'death', 'best', 'Melancholia', 'beautiful', 'emotionally', 'devastating', 'really', 'have', 'meet', 'Lars', 'way', 'get', 'Melancholia', 'worst', 'bloated', 'pretentious.Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'good', 'visual', 'eye', 'screenwriting', 'editing', 'are', 'sloppy', 'Lars', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'cut', 'down', 'length', 'add', 'more', 'what', 'going', 'Antichrist', 'Lars', 'sure', 'loves', 'have', 'characters', 'depressed', ""n't"", 'really', 'found', 'way', 'convey', 'Antichrist', 'more', 'going', 'here', 'real', 'sense', 'beauty', ""n't"", 'have', 'resort', 'unnecessary', 'dumb', 'gore.It', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'director', 'conceited', 'film', 'therapy', 'depression', 'main', 'actress', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'openly', 'admitted', 'suffering', 'depression', 'whole', 'film', 'revolves', 'how', 'depression', 'effects', 'everyone', ""'d"", 'only', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'interested', 'depression']",N/A

1498428,AIO247KHD2O40,B005S9EI2Y,James N Simpson,"[4, 5]","This Danish movie needed some editing, it starts off with a credits intro that goes for eight minutes where the director seems to think pressing pause and filming the paused image is something clever.  It might be unique in the film world but missed the point that there is an obvious reason why no one else has done it. That reason is it gets old fast, boring and then annoying. I ended up fast-forwarding to the end of the ridiculous intro, it was that hard to sit through. Even though Melancholia is a Danish made movie the actors speak English and not dubbed or anything like this.  I think Kirsten Dunst does a great acting job with her either mentally disabled or possibly simply severely depressed character Justine. We're never told over the two hours what's wrong with her but the film opens with her wedding and it becomes pretty obvious very fast that she's in no condition to consent to marriage and is simply there because her sister, and others want her to marry the guy. It therefore takes on a bit of a creepy vibe, the guy obviously wants to marry her because she is in a beautiful female adult body, but she clearly doesn't have the mind of an adult.  Even Sutherland's character, the husband of her sister has a creepy you remember our deal line after telling her off for the amount of money he's spent on the party (wedding) which she keeps trying to escape and hide away in different parts of the mansion, implying with the our deal line she's still got to fulfil certain bedroom duties for him when her a lot less attractive sister isn't around, even though she's marrying this other guy. So I do think Dunst does do a brilliant job, it's just the movie overall is so slow paced and dragged out and there is no real payoff for Justine that you end up wondering what the point of the 2hrs 16 minutes you spent watching it was.The movie is divided into two acts the wedding and post wedding.  The later brings the fact from being a minor focus, to the main backdrop focus, that some planet which has been hiding behind the sun unnoticed all this time called Melancholia, is possibly going to crash into Earth. The makers of this film seem to want to turn your typical cartoon image of the moon rising over a lake into a planet rising over the golf course that was in the backyard of the Danish mansion everyone lives in. Even though you can't detect the curvature of the Earth in real life, somehow you can see it in this film.  Both acts 1 and 2 just seemed pointless, there was no payoff at the end of either. This is one of those movies once you've seen it you wish you'd done something else instead. The only thing reason really to watch it is that Dunst goes topless in a very arty pose at the hour and half mark, but you could probably just Google that image rather than buying this.",2,"Too Long, a Little Creepy and You Wonder What the Whole Point of it Was When it's Over!",1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,2809,"['Danish', 'movie', 'needed', 'editing', 'credits', 'intro', 'eight', 'minutes', 'where', 'director', 'think', 'pressing', 'pause', 'filming', 'paused', 'image', 'something', 'clever', 'might', 'be', 'unique', 'film', 'world', 'missed', 'point', 'obvious', 'reason', 'why', 'one', 'else', 'done', 'reason', 'old', 'fast', 'boring', 'then', 'annoying', 'ended', 'up', 'fast-forwarding', 'end', 'ridiculous', 'intro', 'was', 'hard', 'sit', 'Even', 'Melancholia', 'Danish', 'made', 'movie', 'actors', 'speak', 'English', 'not', 'dubbed', 'anything', 'think', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'great', 'acting', 'job', 'mentally', 'disabled', 'possibly', 'simply', 'severely', 'depressed', 'character', 'Justine', ""'re"", 'never', 'told', 'over', 'two', 'hours', 'what', 'wrong', 'film', 'wedding', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'very', 'fast', 'condition', 'consent', 'marriage', 'simply', 'there', 'sister', 'others', 'want', 'marry', 'guy', 'therefore', 'bit', 'creepy', 'vibe', 'guy', 'obviously', 'marry', 'beautiful', 'female', 'adult', 'body', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'have', 'mind', 'adult', 'Even', 'Sutherland', 'character', 'husband', 'sister', 'creepy', 'remember', 'deal', 'line', 'telling', 'off', 'amount', 'money', 'spent', 'party', 'wedding', 'trying', 'escape', 'hide', 'away', 'different', 'parts', 'mansion', 'implying', 'deal', 'line', 'still', 'got', 'fulfil', 'certain', 'bedroom', 'duties', 'when', 'lot', 'less', 'attractive', 'sister', ""n't"", 'around', 'even', 'marrying', 'other', 'guy', 'do', 'think', 'Dunst', 'do', 'brilliant', 'job', 'just', 'movie', 'overall', 'so', 'slow', 'paced', 'dragged', 'out', 'real', 'payoff', 'Justine', 'end', 'up', 'wondering', 'what', 'point', '2hrs', '16', 'minutes', 'spent', 'watching', 'was.The', 'movie', 'divided', 'two', 'wedding', 'post', 'wedding', 'later', 'fact', 'being', 'minor', 'focus', 'main', 'backdrop', 'focus', 'planet', 'been', 'hiding', 'sun', 'unnoticed', 'time', 'called', 'Melancholia', 'possibly', 'going', 'crash', 'Earth', 'makers', 'film', 'seem', 'want', 'turn', 'typical', 'cartoon', 'image', 'moon', 'rising', 'lake', 'planet', 'rising', 'golf', 'course', 'was', 'backyard', 'Danish', 'mansion', 'everyone', 'Even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'detect', 'curvature', 'Earth', 'real', 'life', 'somehow', 'can', 'see', 'film', '1', '2', 'just', 'seemed', 'pointless', 'was', 'payoff', 'end', 'one', 'movies', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'wish', ""'d"", 'done', 'something', 'else', 'instead', 'only', 'thing', 'reason', 'really', 'watch', 'Dunst', 'topless', 'very', 'arty', 'pose', 'hour', 'half', 'mark', 'could', 'probably', 'just', 'Google', 'image', 'rather', 'buying']",N/A

1498431,A1ZVB9D94R8V93,B005S9EI2Y,jbro,"[0, 2]","This is one of those movies that you will probably love or hate.  Since I routinely come across movies that I love and other people can't stand; or movies that I believe are the worst ever and others genuinely appreciate, I will relay a different type of review that I feel might give you a better perspective on what to expect with Melancholia.First off, let me say this...I believe that just about everyone would agree that the music and cinematography are exceptional.  However, that obviously is not all that makes a movie.  So here goes. (I won't include any spoilers, btw.)Melancholia is primarily about two sisters and how they relate to one another and to others in the face of the possible destruction of the planet.  This is not, I repeat NOT a science fiction film.  If you are expecting a wild element of sci-fi excitement there is only a small touch of that, although the effects are more than adequate.  This is a movie that takes its time exploring the relationships the two sisters have while revealing the depths and ever-changing energy of a person suffering from depression.Kirsten Dunst plays the role of Justine, a young woman suffering from melancholia (a fairly antiquated term for depression).  Her sister Claire, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, takes it upon herself to watch over her and defend her from the repercussions of her actions, as well as those of others in response to her illness.  As in real life, depression often runs in the family and their mother, Gaby, (Charlotte Rampling) obviously suffers issues of her own.  This circumstance results in some of the best acting you will see, as Dunst and Gainsbourg very convincingly behave as though they have lived most of their lives together, dealing with the challenges of life and responding in their own, unique way.And now comes the hard part.  Is this movie any good?  I'll take it from two different angles.Have you ever been in an art museum and quietly reflected upon a painting that struck you as sad or dark, yet beautiful?  Did you sit there patiently and let it soak into your soul....absorbing the melancholy the artist must have felt when creating it?  If so, you will probably love this movie.  The title of the movie is appropriate not just because it is a term for Justine's illness or because the rogue planet is named Melancholia, but also because it captures the actual feeling of melancholy.  Just as a quality impressionist painting transmits the mood and feeling of a particular scene rather than how life-like it looks, this movie is a moving work of art that requires you to let your guard down and allow yourself to become part of the beautiful sadness and enjoy it as you did in front of that painting.Do you typically guess at what is to come at a movie?  Do you try to figure them out as you are watching them and feel uncomfortable with slow scenes that do not appear to be advancing a plot?  If so, there is nothing wrong with that, but you will probably not like this one.Looking for action?...not your flick.  Looking for romance?...sorry.  How about the good ole &#34;shaky camera&#34; trick?  There is a lot of that in here and I hate the shaky camera.  But I have to admit that I really enjoyed it in spite of that.  (way too much shaky camera if you ask me...WAY too much).The bottom line here is this...if you had a hard week at work and need to see a movie that excites you without much thinking about it, or conversely, you are looking for something that challenges your brain to figure it out and exercise your skills in logic, or anything in between, you may not enjoy this too much.  This movie falls completely outside that linear line.  Melancholia is all about experiencing, and ever so patiently enjoying the under-appreciated feeling of wonder, beauty, and uniquely satisfying sadness...of melancholy.",4,"The good, the bad, and the sad",1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,3834,"['one', 'movies', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'hate', 'routinely', 'come', 'movies', 'love', 'other', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'movies', 'believe', 'are', 'worst', 'ever', 'others', 'genuinely', 'appreciate', 'will', 'relay', 'different', 'type', 'review', 'feel', 'might', 'give', 'better', 'perspective', 'what', 'expect', 'Melancholia.First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'believe', 'just', 'everyone', 'would', 'agree', 'music', 'cinematography', 'are', 'exceptional', 'However', 'obviously', 'not', 'movie', 'So', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'include', 'spoilers', 'btw', 'Melancholia', 'primarily', 'two', 'sisters', 'how', 'relate', 'one', 'others', 'face', 'possible', 'destruction', 'planet', 'not', 'repeat', 'science', 'fiction', 'film', 'are', 'expecting', 'wild', 'element', 'sci-fi', 'excitement', 'only', 'small', 'touch', 'effects', 'are', 'more', 'adequate', 'movie', 'time', 'exploring', 'relationships', 'two', 'sisters', 'have', 'revealing', 'depths', 'ever-changing', 'energy', 'person', 'suffering', 'depression.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'role', 'Justine', 'young', 'woman', 'suffering', 'melancholia', 'fairly', 'antiquated', 'term', 'depression', 'sister', 'Claire', 'played', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'watch', 'defend', 'repercussions', 'actions', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'response', 'illness', 'real', 'life', 'depression', 'often', 'family', 'mother', 'Gaby', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'obviously', 'issues', 'own', 'circumstance', 'results', 'best', 'acting', 'will', 'see', 'Dunst', 'Gainsbourg', 'very', 'convincingly', 'behave', 'have', 'lived', 'most', 'lives', 'together', 'dealing', 'challenges', 'life', 'responding', 'own', 'unique', 'way.And', 'now', 'hard', 'part', 'movie', 'good', ""'ll"", 'take', 'two', 'different', 'angles.Have', 'ever', 'been', 'art', 'museum', 'quietly', 'reflected', 'painting', 'struck', 'sad', 'dark', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'Did', 'sit', 'there', 'patiently', 'let', 'soak', 'soul', '.absorbing', 'melancholy', 'artist', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'when', 'creating', 'so', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'movie', 'title', 'movie', 'appropriate', 'not', 'just', 'term', 'Justine', 'illness', 'rogue', 'planet', 'named', 'Melancholia', 'also', 'actual', 'feeling', 'melancholy', 'Just', 'quality', 'impressionist', 'painting', 'transmits', 'mood', 'feeling', 'particular', 'scene', 'rather', 'how', 'life-like', 'movie', 'moving', 'work', 'art', 'let', 'guard', 'down', 'allow', 'become', 'part', 'beautiful', 'sadness', 'enjoy', 'did', 'front', 'painting.Do', 'typically', 'guess', 'what', 'come', 'movie', 'Do', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'are', 'watching', 'feel', 'uncomfortable', 'slow', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'advancing', 'plot', 'so', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'one.Looking', 'action', 'not', 'flick', 'Looking', 'romance', 'sorry', 'How', 'good', 'ole', '34', 'shaky', 'camera', '34', 'trick', 'lot', 'here', 'hate', 'shaky', 'camera', 'have', 'admit', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'spite', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'shaky', 'camera', 'ask', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', '.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'here', 'had', 'hard', 'week', 'work', 'need', 'see', 'movie', 'much', 'thinking', 'conversely', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'brain', 'figure', 'out', 'exercise', 'skills', 'logic', 'anything', 'may', 'not', 'enjoy', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'completely', 'outside', 'linear', 'line', 'Melancholia', 'experiencing', 'ever', 'so', 'patiently', 'enjoying', 'under-appreciated', 'feeling', 'wonder', 'beauty', 'uniquely', 'satisfying', 'sadness', 'melancholy']",N/A

You may not like his films, or even understand them, but they stay in the memory, and Melancholia is no exception. Structured into two parts, it is a story of two sisters, Justine and Claire, played by Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg respectively.Part 1. concerns Justine at her wedding party, a hugely expensive and elaborately planned affair, detailed down to the precise minute....the entire affair is unraveled by night's end as von Trier brilliantly peels off layer by layer of emotional issues, leaving the externally controlled Justine willingly withdrawn from her preplanned life. Obsessed with the star Antares and it's eventual disappearance, she progressively rejects every facet of her life, of which she is mortally afraid.Part 2. concerns Claire, the main controller in Part 1, and her increasing fear of death as the planet Melancholia approaches the earth.Together, the two parts form a gorgeously filmed juxtaposition of fears and obsessions with plenty of symbolism scattered throughout. A memorable example is Claire searching in terror for Justine at night, only to find her nude on a river bank, illuminated in a blueish light from Melancholia, longing erotically for death. Objects are also juxtaposed, such as the bottle of beans in Part 1 and the ""Magic Cave"" in Part 2.Overall, this is a great psychological and meditative film that, like von Trier's films usually are, never give answers, but do compel you to pause and reflect.",5,A multi-layered film - just a few observations...,1322265600,"11 26, 2011",2011,1557,"['Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'controversial', 'oft-times', 'enigmatic', 'one', 'greatest', 'film', 'makers', 'ever', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'films', 'even', 'understand', 'stay', 'memory', 'Melancholia', 'exception', 'Structured', 'two', 'parts', 'story', 'two', 'sisters', 'Justine', 'Claire', 'played', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'respectively.Part', '1.', 'concerns', 'Justine', 'wedding', 'party', 'hugely', 'expensive', 'elaborately', 'planned', 'affair', 'detailed', 'down', 'precise', 'minute', '.the', 'entire', 'affair', 'unraveled', 'night', 'end', 'von', 'Trier', 'brilliantly', 'layer', 'layer', 'emotional', 'issues', 'leaving', 'externally', 'controlled', 'Justine', 'willingly', 'withdrawn', 'preplanned', 'life', 'Obsessed', 'star', 'Antares', 'eventual', 'disappearance', 'progressively', 'facet', 'life', 'mortally', 'afraid.Part', '2.', 'concerns', 'Claire', 'main', 'controller', 'Part', '1', 'increasing', 'fear', 'death', 'planet', 'Melancholia', 'earth.Together', 'two', 'parts', 'form', 'gorgeously', 'filmed', 'juxtaposition', 'fears', 'obsessions', 'plenty', 'symbolism', 'scattered', 'memorable', 'example', 'Claire', 'searching', 'terror', 'Justine', 'night', 'only', 'find', 'nude', 'river', 'bank', 'illuminated', 'blueish', 'light', 'Melancholia', 'longing', 'erotically', 'death', 'Objects', 'are', 'also', 'juxtaposed', 'such', 'bottle', 'beans', 'Part', '1', 'Magic', 'Cave', 'Part', '2.Overall', 'great', 'psychological', 'meditative', 'film', 'von', 'Trier', 'films', 'usually', 'are', 'never', 'give', 'answers', 'do', 'compel', 'pause', 'reflect']",N/A

While the actors do justice to the material, it's the material that deadens this film to where you don't care about any of the characters as they are so self-absorbed and mopey that I was cheering for the planets to collide twenty minutes into the film. I won't go into the plot points here, but I found the whole set-up here to be too pretentious and a bit foppish. Dunst's character is so illogically constructed--she starts off as this lovely, smiling bride who is in love with her groom. Then in a matter of moments, she's this sullen, brooding harridan and there's no real segue into her dark descent. Her family members are all cinematic steroeotypes (the complaining sister, the bitter divorced mom and the shady daddy) and speak in generic platitutdes. And the groom is perfectly fine, but the bride decides to spurn him for no real reason and then has sex with a man who she (and the audience) barely knows. I know a lot of folks might think this is ""high art,"" but it's simply shoddy storytelling. Finally, the film turns towards the approaching planet and this is where it completely derides itself--focusing on four characters and their own self-loathing. By the end, I wanted the planet to win! It's a gorgeously made film and well acted; it's just dreadful in terms of its script and overall story.",2,Lovely to look at....but not much else,1321747200,"11 20, 2011",2011,1563,"['MELANCHOLIA', 'lovely', 'look', 'visuals', 'are', 'most', 'impressive', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'However', 'THE', 'TREE', 'OF', 'LIFE', 'story', 'script', 'are', 'so', 'unengaging', 'was', 'ultimately', 'bored', 'highly', 'irritated', 'characters', 'screen', 'actors', 'do', 'justice', 'material', 'material', 'film', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'self-absorbed', 'was', 'cheering', 'planets', 'collide', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'plot', 'points', 'here', 'found', 'whole', 'set-up', 'here', 'be', 'too', 'pretentious', 'bit', 'foppish', 'Dunst', 'character', 'so', 'illogically', 'constructed', 'off', 'lovely', 'smiling', 'bride', 'who', 'love', 'groom', 'Then', 'matter', 'moments', 'sullen', 'brooding', 'harridan', 'real', 'segue', 'dark', 'descent', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'cinematic', 'steroeotypes', 'complaining', 'sister', 'bitter', 'divorced', 'mom', 'shady', 'daddy', 'speak', 'generic', 'platitutdes', 'groom', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'bride', 'spurn', 'real', 'reason', 'then', 'sex', 'man', 'who', 'audience', 'barely', 'know', 'lot', 'folks', 'might', 'think', 'high', 'art', 'simply', 'shoddy', 'storytelling', 'Finally', 'film', 'approaching', 'planet', 'where', 'completely', 'focusing', 'four', 'characters', 'own', 'self-loathing', 'end', 'wanted', 'planet', 'win', 'gorgeously', 'made', 'film', 'well', 'acted', 'just', 'dreadful', 'terms', 'script', 'overall', 'story']",N/A

1498439,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B005S9EI2Y,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[3, 6]","Melancholia is an apocalyptic-drama that focuses on themes like death and depression. The story is split into two parts named after the two sisters, Justine and Claire. It's a story about their relationship and what happens to it as a new planet threatens to destroy Earth. Overall, the film left me with mixed emotions and I was left in the middle.What did I like about the film? Melancholia is shot beautifully! The first 8 minutes of the film is composed of several shots of the characters in slow motion in beautiful environments. Not only that, but the story is original and deep. Although I personally dislike most of Part 1: Justine, Part 2: Claire is a powerful drama with immersive dialogue between characters leading to a sad but beautiful ending. Also, the acting was fine and the music was amazing!What didn't I like? Melancholia sadly overstays its welcome. As I previously stated, the first part was too long and almost pointless. It did take time to develop characters and set-up the second part of the film, but I felt like it took way too long to do so. It was okay, but I'm afraid for some moviegoers the first part will cause boredom. It probably could've been cut and half and still be as affective as it was; cutting in half probably would've created a generally more enjoyable experience.Do I recommend Melancholia? For people who absolutely love all types of film, like me, I definitely recommend checking it out. If you're a casual moviegoer and you want to see what the hype is about, here's what I recommend: Watch the first 8 minutes, watch some of part 1 (or read about it beforehand and skip it completely), and enjoy the magnificent second part.

1498440,A1VGYIJOPR7SGZ,B005S9EI2Y,josh,"[0, 2]","The low ratings here on Amazon show how how feebleminded the general public is when they hear about the Lars von Trier film. They look for shock value and that's what they expected of  this film. Well this film does not ride on that wave. So does does this mean that this is not a very good Lars von Trier film? Absolutely not instead it has incredible performances by the entire cast. And I find the plot of this film to be one of the most important themes he has ever dealt with in any of his films. Visually just as if not better than his past works. The lovely Charlotte Gainsbourg gives one of her most tender and humanistic performances of her career in this film. And Kiersten Dunst blew me away with her performance as you have never seen her play before. Her very well executed performance relies on very little dialogue and uses very deadpan expressions that carries her throughout the whole film with such complexity. I have been following Lars von Triers career since he worked on television in his native Copenhagen blowing me away on his haunting hospital Epic, The Kingdom, which typically America stole and Stephen King made his own American failure of the version. But this was the beginning of his career and I've vowed that I would always support what he does. Is Melancholia  as good as Antichrist or Nymphomaniac? Well I can say is Melancholia is neither of those films. But just as good if not better. The public is to stop expecting what Lars is supposed to make and appreciate the diversity of his subject matter. He's one of the hardest working film directors in the history of film. watch this film and don't think about his other films and I guarantee you you will grade this film higher than 90% of the films you've seen in the past decade at least. But for gods sake someone please release the hauntingly and skillfully ,without horror, violence or cheap shock the most scary and epic danish television show he made called The Kingdom and you will begin to understand why he was always great from the start.",5,Underrated by those who continually look for shock value constantly from him instead of an important beautiful film for humanity,1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,2036,"['low', 'ratings', 'here', 'Amazon', 'show', 'how', 'how', 'feebleminded', 'general', 'public', 'when', 'hear', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'film', 'look', 'shock', 'value', 'what', 'expected', 'film', 'Well', 'film', 'not', 'ride', 'wave', 'So', 'mean', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'film', 'Absolutely', 'not', 'instead', 'incredible', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'find', 'plot', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'themes', 'ever', 'dealt', 'films', 'Visually', 'just', 'not', 'better', 'past', 'works', 'lovely', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'one', 'most', 'tender', 'humanistic', 'performances', 'career', 'film', 'Kiersten', 'Dunst', 'blew', 'away', 'performance', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'play', 'before', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'performance', 'relies', 'very', 'little', 'dialogue', 'very', 'deadpan', 'expressions', 'whole', 'film', 'such', 'complexity', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'Lars', 'von', 'Triers', 'career', 'worked', 'television', 'native', 'Copenhagen', 'blowing', 'away', 'haunting', 'hospital', 'Epic', 'Kingdom', 'typically', 'America', 'stole', 'Stephen', 'King', 'made', 'own', 'American', 'failure', 'version', 'was', 'beginning', 'career', ""'ve"", 'vowed', 'would', 'always', 'support', 'what', 'Is', 'Melancholia', 'as', 'good', 'Antichrist', 'Nymphomaniac', 'Well', 'can', 'say', 'Melancholia', 'films', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'public', 'stop', 'expecting', 'what', 'Lars', 'supposed', 'make', 'appreciate', 'diversity', 'subject', 'matter', 'one', 'hardest', 'working', 'film', 'directors', 'history', 'film', 'watch', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'films', 'guarantee', 'will', 'grade', 'film', 'higher', '90', '%', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', 'decade', 'least', 'gods', 'sake', 'someone', 'please', 'release', 'hauntingly', 'skillfully', 'horror', 'violence', 'cheap', 'shock', 'most', 'scary', 'epic', 'danish', 'television', 'show', 'made', 'called', 'Kingdom', 'will', 'begin', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'always', 'great', 'start']",N/A
1498441,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B005S9EI2Y,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[16, 21]","It would be unjust of me to critique Melancholia without first admitting that I didn't finish it with a complete understanding of what I had just seen. I can recite the specifics of the plot and it's not an impenetrable film, but if we were to get into the semantics of subtext, symbolism, and meaning; I would come up short. I think writer/director Lars von Trier would be unsatisfied with his own genius if someone completely understood the film upon first viewing anyway. This admission does not, I feel, make me any less capable of reviewing the film. A review is often a first impression, rarely written with finality. Indeed, there's also the chance that I understood everything there was to understand about the film and am reading too deeply into it. Von Trier has never been a director preoccupied with subtlety.Melancholia is von Trier's latest film, following his beautiful and brilliant filmAntichrist. That film was his first foray into the horror genre, while this latest film has him dipping into science-fiction. Much of the scenario warrants the science-fiction label and the plot, at face value, could serve a mainstream disaster film but this is a von Trier film and Melancholia toys with elements of science-fiction without ever becoming science-fiction. It would be much too linear, too easy and it's an interesting move for von Trier to even skim the surface of the genre as reluctantly as he does. The idea reportedly came to him while he was struggling with depression and a therapist commented that people suffering from depression remain calm in stressful situations. Von Trier responds to this by putting his characters into an end-of-the-world scenario. The plot concerns two sisters and a planet called Melancholia that's expected to collide with Earth. It's not entirely important though as Melancholia is concerned more with expression than exposition.The title of the film and planet give insight into what von Trier is attempting to accomplish. According to Wikipedia, Melancholia is a mood disorder of non-specific depression, characterized by low levels of both enthusiasm and eagerness for activity. Furthermore, in ancient usage, it encompassed mental disorders that would now be called schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder. After seeing the film, I found this to be a fascinating revelation; one that makes the film seem a bit more heavy-handed in retrospect.Much like Antichrist, Melancholia begins with an attention-grabbing opening sequence, similarly stylized and equally beautiful although not as easy to follow. There are shots of a lugubrious looking Kirsten Dunst, the Earth, the moon, and the rogue planet that gives the film its title. It concludes with a shot of Melancholia colliding with Earth. Von Trier wouldn't want his audience in suspense for the next couple hours. The film is separated into two parts (entitled ""Justine"" & ""Claire""), each running about an hour long. Part one opens at the lavish wedding reception of Justine (Dunst) and Michael (Alexander Skarsgrd), hosted at the mansion of Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland). As Justin arrives, she notices a red star in the sky. John informs her that it's Antares, the main star in the Scorpio constellation.The reception is swimming with familiar faces, including John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling (as Justine and Claire's estranged parents, Dexter and Gaby), Stellan Skarsgrd as Justine's boss Jack, Jack's nephew Tim (Brady Corbet), and Udo Kier as the quirky wedding planner who refuses to look at Justine because she's ""ruined"" his wedding. The familiar faces all bring separate kinds of strife to the reception, beginning with a short, but stinging argument between Dexter and Gaby during a toast. Gaby is a cold, confrontational woman and John eventually retaliates by throwing her luggage outside. It becomes clear that Justine suffers from depression and even during her wedding party, she falls into bouts of sadness. Claire and John, who are footing the bill, grow frustrated over Justine's inability to appear happy and that's not even all of it. Emotions of all different kinds run high, but they're understated. Von Trier is not one for subtlety, but he strays far from theatricality too. The wedding party concludes with perhaps the most depressing ending to a wedding party ever put on film. This happens 63 minutes in. This detail could make or break someone's decision to see this film.Part two is a different animal, with much of the focus turning to Claire. The planet Melancholia has been hiding behind the sun and Claire fears it will collide with Earth in five days, although John is confident that it's merely going to beautifully pass by. With no suspense to keep us guessing, we're allowed to more closely follow and analyze the characters.The intimate cinematography makes frequent use of handheld cameras and the zoom feature, a technique that will frustrate many. It's an effective approach, which brings the audience closer to the drama. The film alternates between quiet, intimate moments/conversations between characters to moments of cinematic art punctuated by the somber music from Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. This music becomes the film's main theme and greatly complements the beautifully murky atmosphere. It's a beautifully dreary and (yes) melancholy film to behold.The meaning of the word ""pretentious"" has been unfairly stigmatized by its overuse in regards to challenging films. Oftentimes, pretentious has become a euphemism for ""I didn't understand this film."" Its negative connotations make it difficult to use in serious film discussions. It's unfortunate, because pretentious is not necessarily an insulting term. Von Trier is a pretentious filmmaker whose films aren't challenging due to subject matter alone, but because they're so heavy, so serious, they can be difficult to labor through. Melancholia is as sad as the characters that inhabit it and there's nary a moment of happiness. It's so serious, so consistently downbeat it has a staggering effect since a single viewing can't do complete justice to this film, but it's unlikely you'll want to sit through it more than once.As heavy and emotional as the material is, it's an emotionally cold film that never evoked a similar emotional response from me. It fascinated me at times, but never rocked me. I never found it tedious, but I can guarantee many viewers will. On the flipside, many viewers think it was one of the best films of last year. I'd agree, but it wouldn't make my shortlist.When Melancholia premiered at Cannes, more press was given to Lars von Trier's failed attempt at humor than to Kirsten Dunst's Best Actress win. It seems that Dunst has been making a conscious effort to establish herself as a truly serious actress, straying from the mainstream in favor of more challenging independent films. This is certainly the most mature, adult role she's approached. It's a delicate performance, highly emotional and psychologically complex that Dunst doesn't overplay and, perhaps as a result, I'm not floored by her performance. Perhaps I didn't anticipate how quietly emotional it would be. I may have expected less subtlety. She does kind of play second fiddle to Gainsbourg in the latter half anyway. After her performance in Antichrist, Gainsbourg has a tough job trying to impress the audience further but her performance is on par with Dunst's. Sutherland also gives a mature performance that reminds us of what he gifted actor he can be with solid material.Melancholia is a pretentious (no insult intended), challenging film that both fascinates and perplexes me. Even with a deeper understanding of it, I'd find it hard to love but I respect and admire it greatly on several levels. It's definitely what the average moviegoer would negatively refer to as an ""art film"" though. Those who like von Trier will find things to appreciate, those who don't won't find much to change their minds, and those unfamiliar with his work should approach with caution. I certainly can't help but admire a filmmaker who makes me think about his film, even if he fails to make me enjoy it.GRADE: B",4,"A Fascinating, Perplexing Movie",1330905600,"03 5,

His world seems to be populated entirely by disagreeable, self-absorbed, and clinically depressed people who tend to wander aimlessly about in vast empty landscapes.  He also wants us to know up front that this is to be an ""Art"" film, so he begins with a collage of abstract imagery filmed in a hyper-realistic, super slow motion style which is accompanied by some wildly inappropriate Wagnerian music.  Perhaps the music is meant to be ironic.  As if all this weren't enough to prove his Art Film credentials, we soon learn that this world is about to be destroyed by a rogue planet.  Doom and gloom reign.  Along the way, we are treated to the usual shaky hand-held camera work, mysteriously burning paintings, and several symbolic clues - to what?  (One of these is a horse that refuses to cross a bridge, which I gather is a reference to one of the director's previous films - the ultimate film geek reference).

If Zach Snyder (The Watchmen, 300) directed this movie people would immediately troll him on the internet. But this film gets a pass among film critics because Lars Von Trier, who is considered an auteur, directed this.It&#8217;s a story of two sisters facing the apocalypse and how they react to it. One gives in to her instinct and accepts the doom albeit in a very depressed fashion. The other sister denies the inevitable and relies on science to soothe her, and panics when faced with the truth.It has some very nice visuals that seem to be stills (maybe they where), recalling work by Tarsem Singh (The Fall, Immortals). The pacing is slow and deliberate, and picks up speed by the second sisters story.There are illogical and unrealistic situations in this film. The type of approaching apocalypse should have had killed everyone before it finally happened.

1498460,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B005S9EI2Y,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[5, 7]","Danish filmmaker Lars Von Trier crafts movies somewhat reflective of his own character, and experiences. InAntichrist, a psychiatrist, and his wife, take a vacation, in the woods, and he has concerns that his wife's psychotherapy is not working, while both contend with an unthinkable loss. Lars struggles with depression have been well documented, as have his awkward comments about Nazism at the Cannes Film Festival, which have become a youtube phenomenon. Melancholia was crafted from a depressed state.It's not difficult to see how personal experience emerges as art, in Melancholia, with depression being represented through a feminine lens mostly through the character Justine, played by Kirsten Dunst. The movie opens with a stunning five minute visual sequence with no dialogue, and a Wagnerian music soundtrack. As this happened, immediately I began to compare it to Tree of Life, although it's the antithetical, instead of creation, birth, and optimism we have a mood piece with destructive overtones.As the movie begins we see snippets of a story unfolding in slow motion, snippets which will be developed later in the story, a woman in a wedding dress, a pretty face leeched of all energy, a horse unable to stand sinking in mud, and two planets about to collide.When the movie proper begins we see a bride happy on her wedding day, at a castle in the country, with a 19 hole golf course.As the evening dwindles down, her happy countenance diffuses, with self serving bitter cynical comments by her mother, played by Charlotte Rampling, directed at marriage. As someone prone to depression, she becomes assailed by lethargy and melancholy. Her sister, Claire played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, comforts her. As the facade begins to fall apart, she has sex with a random stranger, and a destructive confrontation with her boss, also the best man. Next morning her husband leaves her, and she has a breakdown. She remains at the castle owned by her sister, and her brother in law played by Kiefer Sutherland.Meanwhile, a previously unknown planet Melancholia has emerged from the sun, and heads towards earth. We don't know if it will collide, and end the world or pass by. As it gets closer, its oppressive energy effects everyone, and both Claire and husband exhibit anxiety and depression, while Justine strangely becomes calmer. A mysterious scene has Claire searching a locked drawer looking for antidepressants. To whom do they belong? She, her husband or Justine?If depression is the anticipation of loss then depressed people may be less troubled by a disastrous future, because they already anticipate loss. The prospect of the end of the world may very well be an antidepressant, as it proposes the alleviation of suffering.The good points of this movie were its visuals, particularly the acting of Kirsten Dunst, who perfectly and convincingly plays the role of a depressed woman. She acknowldeges she would not have produced this performance without Von Trier. She won the Best Actress award at Cannes in 2011. Coupled with Charlotte Gainsbourg's performance, we have two great performances. Charlotte Gainsbourg previously won Best Actress at Cannes for her performance in Antichrist. One point of interest was the parallelsim of how horses who know nothing of the news finds themselves lacking energy, and how the proximity of Melanchol(y)a effects other peoples energy. Carl Jung said 'perception is projection.'As someone with personal experience of the subject, I can say Von Trier represents depression effectively, and Dunst represents it accurately.I have mixed feelings about the movie. I think it will get a mixed reaction from people. Some people will love it, and some people will hate it. If you did not like Tree of Life, you probably will not like this movie. If you did like The Tree of Life as I did you still may not like this movie. By the wayThe Tree of Life (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)won for best movie at Cannes in 2011.Its slow pace while artistic is not necessarily engrossing. Something of the mood of the characters was conveyed to me while watching, and I had the parallel experience of feeling drained of energy at the time, although now I am glad I saw it.I definitely recommend getting it as a rental before you buy, and watch Tree of Life first.

1498466,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B005S9EI2Y,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[90, 117]","There's a big difference between Art and Story. The two do not necessarily preclude each other, but in movies, filmmakers tend to favor the latter over the former. This has resulted in wave upon wave of horrible film, granted. However, favoring the former over the latter hasn't resulted in any great shakes, either. In fact, both extremes often end with bewildered or annoyed audiences. However, when a story-based film fails, detractors have a much better time of it, because you can point to plot holes, inconsistent or incomplete characters, cheesy dialogue, or pure cliche. When an ""artsy"" film fails, however, the explosive force between its fans and haters gains extra force because, bottom line, it comes down to taste. Likewise with this film. It has as many glowing reviews as nasty reviews, and the bottom line isn't about the beauty, artistry, or skill of the film. It's about whether or not you believe depression can be an art form. I do not.MELANCHOLIA, as a film, is almost exactly what it sounds like. It is a 136-minute-long gaze at depression. And that's it. Seriously. No, seriously.Do you want a story? Well, fine then. How about this? A sister planet to Earth is discovered. It is named Melancholia (oooh!) and it is headed straight for Earth. If the two planets collide, then the entire human race is doomed. Also, a girl is getting married and she's very sad. The end.Does it seem like I'm exaggerating? I am absolutely not. Kirsten Dunst plays one of the most annoying characters of her career (and that's saying a lot). She is part of a wealthy family on a wealthy estate that is holding a wealthy wedding between her and some other wealthy people. Inexplicably, she's depressed beyond words. The movie never explains why. ""Why"" is not the film's motif. Instead, it patiently and lovingly follows its tortured heroine as she weeps, falls motionless to the floor, or goes and sleeps with total strangers on her wedding night. Because she's so, so, so sad, you see.This is art?I'll admit, Lars Von Trier IS an artist, but if this is what he's going to apply his skill to, then I want none of it. The movie begins with a pastiche of ultra-slow-motion images set to classical music. I didn't time this section, but it seemed to last nearly twenty minutes (I'm almost certainly wrong). I thought every image was gorgeous and stunning, and I immediately knew that I was going to hate the film. Why? Because it announced, at the start, that it was EXCLUSIVELY about the lavishness of the imagery. Even that I could stand if I didn't have to endure another two hours of a pretty and entitled girl crying for absolutely no reason whatsoever. C'mon, Lars! Make it about a short order cook or an oil rig worker or a fifty-year old divorcee with diabetes. Characters with complexity and powerful lives -- these are people I might be able to handle roiling in self-pity for 120 minutes. A disaffected girl who might just be too rich and coddled? Please.I did some research, desperate to understand why such a dismal wreck would ever be conceived, let alone put to film, and I read that Lars wanted to show multiple facets of depression. In other words, he wanted to show the good and the bad, how depression might be useful or workable under certain circumstances. How could that be? Well, it turns out that it is useful to be skilled at depression when the world is going to end. End of Deep Important Message.SPOILERS AHEAD!Yes. The world ends in the film, and part of Lars' message (if the interview is to be believed) is that Dunst's character's familiarity with abiding ennui made her especially suited to enduring the destruction of mankind. This is about the most ridiculous point a film could make, since the utter destruction of mankind renders moot the way any humans deal with it. Who freaking cares if someone deals with Earth's obliteration with suicide, grace and aplomb, selfish weeping, or some kind of drug-fueled orgy? In the end, you're left with one thing: the utter obliteration of mankind. For crying out loud, is this some kind of deep, insightful message?I'm sorry. I probably sound bitter. I guess I am. I only bought and watched this movie after the endless praise it received from critics and friends, and when I returned to said friends with less-than-glowing remarks, I was told that I lacked patience, cared more about commercialism, or was too easily bored.Nah. I like my movies to be about things. And if they're going to travel the path of artistic flair, I'd still like that art -- beautiful or not -- to teach me something either a) new, b) interesting, or c) profound. MELANCHOLIA's message is absolutely NONE of those things, and I will gladly debate anyone who says otherwise. You can film sadness as gorgeously as you want, but if the sadness is prompted by nothing, propelled by nothing, and ends in nothing, then the end result is exactly the same: a big, fat, zero.",1,Depression In A Prom Dress,1339372800,"06 11, 2012",2012,4920,"['big', 'difference', 'Art', 'Story', 'two', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'preclude', 'other', 'movies', 'filmmakers', 'tend',

The notion that a planet many times the size of earth approaching our planet would have no gravitational effect at all on earth until it actually touched it is absurd. People would not just be sitting peacefully on the unmoving ground waiting for the moment of impact. But that's not what the movie is about. It's about how individuals in an isolated place react to the situation. That story couldn't be told if the surface of the earth was breaking up, which is what would happen in reality.  We're never given any real sense of the panic in the world at large as the end approaches. That hotel-like home is isolated. The characters can't even make it into town. The film is focused on them and them alone. And it's about how a character who is established as mentally ill handles the situation with more stoicism and calm than her ""normal"" sister. Because she has a death wish to begin with? That's for you to decide.It's not a perfect movie. There's a lot that can be criticized, though certainly not the acting. It is too slow, and the end of the world should be a bigger deal than it is.

One is a film that entertains the masses, that type of film that you go to and walk out being completely entertained by. The other is the art film, a movie genre that can often times be included in the first category but more often than not is so full of itself that it offers no entertainment at all, just that pseudo intellectual crap that only people who think of themselves as above all others enjoy. I've never believed that they actually enjoy it but have felt that they want to impress those around them so much that they pretend to do so. These are the people who watch a film like Andy Warhol's EMPIRE, a static shot of the Empire State Building from 3AM until the next day, a think it's art. Give me a break.This brings us to MELANCHOLIA. Directed by Lars von Trier, a director that the art house crowd holds in high esteem, the film is one of the most boring things I've ever witnessed. It begins with Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and her new husband en route to their wedding reception. Nearly 5 minutes time is spent with their stretch limo having problems getting around a winding curve as they try and help the driver and take turns driving themselves. They finally arrive and rather than greet their waiting guests, Justine insist on going to say hello to her favorite horse in the stables.Over the next hour or so we simply witness the wedding reception, hear from various guests that are their and watch as Justine, hoping to find some sort of happiness in it all, continues to deal with the depression she is prone to. It doesn't work no matter how hard her family tries to help her (except for her mother played by Charlotte Rampling who piles on the reasons why marriage stinks).As the movie progresses we find out that another planet it hurtling towards are own on a collision course. There is no last minute save here, no heroes trying to launch an atomic bomb at the planet or anything else, just the knowledge that the two will collide and everyone will die. The name they give this planet is Melancholia thus tying it into the whole depression motif witnessed throughout the film.The second half of the film deals more with Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), the one who seemed under control and composed who took care of Justine's wedding and reception. Claire has no idea how to deal with the imminent demise of the world she knows, of her family and slowly begins to fall apart while Justine seems to accept the end calmly and coolly.SPOILER ALERTAs these two sisters and Claire's son gather on the golf course her husband owns under a makeshift bunch of sticks they collected, Melancholia crashes into the planet and everyone dies. The end.I cannot begin to explain how boring this movie was. From scenes of nothing more than people going through the motions of events to the back and forth dialogue that feels like it goes no where all I could think was when will this be over? This is not to say a movie filled with dialogue must be boring. MY DINNER WITH ANDRE was fascinating to watch and listen to. This movie just is...boring.Not only does this movie bore the viewer to death it does little more than attempt to inspire a feeling of depression in it's viewers as well. Its as if von Trier said hey I feel depressed and I don't want to feel alone like this so let me try and make you feel just as bad. Are there people out there without enough problems in their own lives that they need to add to it by sitting through this sort of thing?If you know someone who is eternally happy, who is care free without a fret in the world that you'd like to see brought down a bit then by all means recommend this film to them. By the end even they may be searching for a razor. If not then avoid this film at all costs and hope that von Trier either finds something to make himself happy or stops making movies.",1,BOREDOM ON A STICK,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",2012,3902,"['begin', 'are', 'two', 'sorts', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'One', 'film', 'masses', 'type', 'film', 'go', 'walk', 'being', 'completely', 'entertained', 'other', 'art', 'film', 'movie', 'genre', 'can', 'often', 'times', 'be', 'included', 'first', 'category', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'so', 'full', 'entertainment', 'just', 'pseudo', 'intellectual', 'crap', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'others', 'enjoy', ""'ve"", 'never', 'believed', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'have', 'felt', 'want', 'impress', 'so', 'much', 'pretend', 'do', 'so', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'film', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'EMPIRE', 'static', 'shot', 'Empire', 'State', 'Building', '3AM', 'next', 'day', 'think', 'art', 'Give', 'break.This', 'MELANCHOLIA', 'Directed', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'director', 'art', 'house', 'crowd', 'high', 'esteem', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'witnessed', 'Justine', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'new', 'husband', 'route', 'wedding', 'reception', 'Nearly', '5', 'minutes', 'time', 'spent', 'stretch', 'limo', 'having', 'problems', 'getting', 'winding', 'curve', 'try', 'help', 'driver', 'take', 'turns', 'driving', 'finally', 'arrive', 'rather', 'greet', 'waiting', 'guests', 'Justine', 'insist', 'going', 'say', 'hello', 'favorite', 'horse', 'stables.Over', 'next', 'hour', 'so', 'simply', 'witness', 'wedding', 'reception', 'hear', 'various', 'guests', 'are', 'watch', 'Justine', 'hoping', 'find', 'sort', 'happiness', 'deal', 'depression', 'prone', ""n't"", 'work', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'family', 'help', 'mother', 'played', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'who', 'reasons', 'why', 'marriage', 'stinks', '.As', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'planet', 'hurtling', 'towards', 'are', 'own', 'collision', 'course', 'last', 'minute', 'save', 'here', 'heroes', 'trying', 'launch', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'planet', 'anything', 'else', 'just', 'knowledge', 'two', 'will', 'collide', 'everyone', 'will', 'die', 'name', 'give', 'planet', 'Melancholia', 'thus', 'tying', 'whole', 'depression', 'motif', 'witnessed', 'film.The', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'deals', 'more', 'Justine', 'sister', 'Claire', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'one', 'who', 'seemed', 'control', 'composed', 'who', 'took', 'care', 'Justine', 'wedding', 'reception', 'Claire', 'idea', 'how', 'deal', 'imminent', 'demise', 'world', 'family', 'slowly', 'fall', 'apart', 'Justine', 'accept', 'end', 'calmly', 'coolly.SPOILER', 'ALERTAs', 'two', 'sisters', 'Claire', 'son', 'gather', 'golf', 'course', 'husband', 'makeshift', 'bunch', 'sticks', 'collected', 'Melancholia', 'planet', 'everyone', 'dies', 'end.I', 'can', 'not', 'begin', 'explain', 'how', 'boring', 'movie', 'was', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'more', 'people', 'going', 'motions', 'events', 'back', 'forth', 'dialogue', 'feels', 'where', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'not', 'say', 'movie', 'filled', 'dialogue', 'must', 'be', 'boring', 'MY', 'DINNER', 'WITH', 'ANDRE', 'was', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'listen', 'movie', 'just', 'boring.Not', 'only', 'movie', 'viewer', 'death', 'little', 'more', 'attempt', 'inspire', 'feeling', 'depression', 'viewers', 'as', 'well', 'von', 'Trier', 'said', 'feel', 'depressed', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'feel', 'alone', 'so', 'let', 'try', 'make', 'feel', 'just', 'bad', 'Are', 'there', 'people', 'there', 'enough', 'problems', 'own', 'lives', 'need', 'add', 'sitting', 'sort', 'thing', 'know', 'someone', 'who', 'eternally', 'happy', 'who', 'care', 'free', 'fret', 'world', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'brought', 'down', 'bit', 'then', 'means', 'recommend', 'film', 'end', 'even', 'may', 'be', 'searching', 'razor', 'not', 'then', 'avoid', 'film', 'costs', 'hope', 'von', 'Trier', 'something', 'make', 'happy', 'stops', 'making', 'movies']",N/A

At one point she simply takes a bath. So does her mother. It's all cuckoo.The second half focuses on the Kirsten's sister. Nothing special. Just life. She buys a bottle of pills to kill herself in case Melancholia hits earth. Her husband the whole time insists nothing will happen, Melancholia will miss earth, but finds out he is wrong, steals his wifes pills and kills himself. Leaving his wife and son behind to deal with catastrophe and Kirsten.The scenery is beautiful. But I attribute that to the countryside it was filmed in.I had to fast-forward the last five minutes, I couldnt take it anymore. I really tried. I found the answer I was looking for, Melancholia collided with earth, the end.I should've read the reviews before renting the movie. Apparently, someone named Lars - who is quite a big deal somewhere - suffered from depression and this is what begat of it. It has been insinuated that Americans especially, only want to see happy movies and that we cannot handle depression or ""bad moods"" or anything realistic because ""it"" makes us uncomfortable. It is my opinion that most of us have relatives as self-absorbed as Kirsten Dunst,that I feel it unfair to pay $3.99 to watch self-absorbed relatives (the characters mother and father) on the screen. There is enough crap in the world, that having to sit through someone's psychotic view of the end of the world, and that somehow the depressed are better equipped to deal with the world ending, is unbelievable.

1498473,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B005S9EI2Y,M. Bullions,"[13, 17]","Most films about the apocalypse involve a group of characters, who are trying to run from the disaster at hand, wanting to fix everything, including saving the world. These movies usually include frantic violence and special effects, paper-thin characters, and not even a remote possibility of feeling sympathy for a character, because you know they will win in the end.However, in Lars Von Trier's ""Melancholia"", none of this is really the case. From the opening sequence, you know essentially what is going to happen. However, I won't accuse this film of being predictable, because it uses absolutely no cliches that are so typical of the disaster film sub-genre. And plus, it has much more to fall back on.The film centers around two sisters - Justine (Kirsten Dunst), and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Justine is getting married to Michael (Alexander Skarsgard), however Justine has been severely depressed for a very long time. She hasn't been able to cope with a lot of the changes in her life, and she doesn't know why. Claire has a young son, and she's always been the kind of person who looks after others, her sister, her child, and the rest of her family. When there is talk of a new planet called Melancholia, and the likelihood of it colliding with Earth, it forces Claire and Justine to look back on their lives, and ponder the decisions that they have made, and to find the meaning of their own lives before it becomes too late.If you only need one reason to watch this film, it's Kirsten Dunst. I never quite saw Dunst as a serious actress. I had seen her in mostly comedies, however I thought she gave a wonderful performance in Sofia Coppola's re-imagination of ""Marie Antoinette"", however, I thought that maybe Dunst just got lucky that one time. This film proves that she can act, and she may even be Oscar worthy. Proving herself to be a character actress, her expressive eyes and face tell you so much about her character, even when she is saying nothing at all.Charlotte Gainsbourg was apparently in a few of Triers' other films, yet this is the first thing I had seen her in. She's fabulous shining just as much as Dunst. The audience might relate or identify with her character more, making her, in a way, the heart of this picture. Her acting style is very poignant, quiet and thoughtful. I can't wait to see what she does next. Keifer Sutherland and Alex Skarsgard have minor roles here, and while they're very good, their characters could have been better-developed, and as thought out as the two female leads.Lars Von Trier has made quite a few award-winning films. However, none that I can recall are as universal, approachable and ambitious as ""Melancholia"". As someone who attempted to watch ""Dogville"" and never quite got the hang of it, I can say that this is a massive improvement. First of all, ""Dogville"" had a running time about two minutes shy of three hours. It didn't have enough going for it. However, this one has everything going for it.As the title suggests, a somber, and depressing mood is established early on in the film. However, it displays a lot of fine acting and cinematography, and the way that startling and beautiful images are put together with concertos from Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolde"" make for something beautiful, and uncompromisingly haunting. The theme, or message of this film is about togetherness, and family. However, there are so many metaphors scattered throughout this movie, that you might take something different away from it than I did.Regardless, you won't forget about this film anytime soon. While the term ""art film"" has been thrown around to disposable and forgettable films, this is a true art film. The imagery and soundtrack, and the reputable lack of special effects, considering this is essentially a disaster film, are undeniably refreshing. While it is very depressing and devastating, it leaves an impression that is unlike anything you've experienced in film before.

Um... no.That aside, yes the movie is beautifully filmed.  Dunst does a good job in her role and as someone who is very well acquainted with depression, I found her character believable.  Unfortunately, the rest are very stilted, though the fault seems to be in a script that can't decide whether it's the twenty-first or the eighteenth century.Ultimately, what's frustrating about this movie is that with just a little more common sense and verisimilitude, it could have been fantastic.  As is, it will probably appeal mainly to more pretentious movie-goers who incorrectly surmise that art and believability are mutually exclusive (despite beautiful films like American Beauty and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind proving otherwise).I was excited about this movie after seeing Antichrist and, while not necessarily loving it, still finding it interesting.

I think it was due in large part to the cast that ""Melancholia"" kept my interest, but I must admit that I enjoyed the film. It's not possible to spoil it, as we see the ending before anything else. For eight minutes, we watch the Earth collide with the gas giant planet Melancholia, that was somehow set loose from its own solar system and hurtled into ours, to Wagner's Prelude to ""Tristan and Isolde"". Then, we see Part One, in which the neurotic and chronically melancholic advertising copywriter Justine (Kirsten Dunst) attends her wedding reception with new husband Michael (Alexander Skarsgard) at an expansive country estate owned by her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and brother-in-law John (Kiefer Sutherland).Part Two takes place some months later, as Claire and John, an amateur astronomer, wait for Melancholia to pass by the Earth and give them a spectacular view. Claire is not so sure, though, that Melancholia will pass by safely. Justine, in the meanwhile, has fallen into a severe depression, and Claire has her out to the house in hopes of promoting recovery.Justine's inability to cope with much of anything makes her insufferably self-absorbed. I didn't think that I was going to have much patience for her. But, between Kirsten Dunst's shining performance and Manuel Alberto Claro's impulsive camera, the audience is pulled into Justine's perspective in Part One. It even makes Claire, who is perfectly reasonable and tolerant, seem like she is imposing on her sister. And I had to like the cocksure John, who refused to put up with his equally self-absorbed and insufferable mother-in-law Gaby (Charlotte Rampling). Part Two is more about Claire's world and the thing that she will find impossible to cope with.I'm not surprised that Von Trier would ignore simple issues of place and consistency, or flout them deliberately. But I wondered more than once where this film takes place. A mostly American family with some English staff on an apparently European country estate. But all the guests speak English. And why does one sister speak with an English accent while the other speaks with an American accent? ""Melancholia"" was filmed in Sweden, but I don't imagine it was intended to take place there. Von Trier treats time and place like abstractions. I never did discover the significance of the 19th hole on the golf course, among other oddities. It probably doesn't have any. ""Melancholia"" doesn't seem to be about anything in particular, but it is entrancing at times.The DVD (Magnolia 2012): There are 5 featurettes and 2 theatrical trailers (2 min each). ""About Melancholia"" (12min) interviews the cast, director, and a psychologist about the ideas behind the film, themes, and characters. ""Visual Effects"" (7 min) is about the rogue planet and the collision of planets. ""The Visual Style"" (10 min) interviews Lars Von Trier, director of photography Manuel Alberto Claro about the camera work, and visual effects supervisor Peter Hjoth. ""The Universe"" (4 min) interviews Peter Hjoth and astrophysicist Michael J D Linden-Vrnle about the science behind the film.

There are flowers in hand, a pond and a horse sitting near a footbridge.  All the while, the dynamic symphonic music of Richard Wagner plays over the dream sequence.  Then a loud rumbling of such magnitude that my two large sub-woofers moved the couch and rattled the pictures.  It was amazing.  I was able to see this film on the HDNet channel at the same time it was released in theaters.  The film then segues to the same bride inside a stretch limo along with her new husband (Alexander Skarsgard) enroute to a reception at a castle that would make Queen Elizabeth proud.  The film is divided into two parts, each named for the only characters that really matter.  Justine (Kirsten Dunst) is the bride.  Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is her sister and the wife of the man who owns the estate (complete with an 18 hole golf course) played by Kiefer Sutherland.There is some mention early on about the unusual star in the sky.  It is a large planet that is making its way toward Earth.  John (Sutherland) insists that the science indicates the planet will come relatively close but in essence do a flyby.  No one seems overly concerned.  There are no radios or TV playing and certainly no panic by anyone.  Are the scientists making an honest prognosis or are they shielding the population?  We don't know.Justine begins to act strange but we are led to believe she has some history of mental illness.  Both her parents played by John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling are a bit odd to say the least.  Claire seems to be the one holding everything together.  Justine comes and goes to the party.  She takes a bath, she returns to the party for a toast.  She stares at the sky, she returns.  She shuns her new husband's attempt at romance, but goes out to a sand trap on the golf course to have random sex with a stranger.  She returns to the party for some Champaign.  Eventually, Justine goes into a grave state of depression.  Her husband leaves her at the estate the next morning.  With Clair's help, Justine begins to regain control of her emotions.  She becomes stable, clear thinking and accepting of the situation.  All the while the planet named Melancholia looms closer and becomes a bright blue ball in the sky.  Now Claire becomes paranoid and the sister's roles reverse.This entire section of the film, while perhaps essential is extremely tedious and unnecessarily long.  The final 30 minutes however switch gears and we become increasingly concerned about the potential collision...even when the foreign planet appears to be getting smaller and drifting away.  Controversial Danish director Lars von Trier doesn't spend any time on explosions, rescue missions, falling buildings, running animals, high winds, flooding or any other typical doom related effects.  What we do get is the sound of the huge planet coming toward Earth.  There go the subs again.This movie is far from perfect.  The middle is muddled.  Von Trier throws metaphors, religion and subtext at us throughout. We get no substance of the science.  While both parents are British only Claire has a British accent.  There is no discounting the convincing performances by Gainsbourg and especially Dunst even with an American accent.  And I have to admit, I kept thinking about this movie long after it was over.",3,3 1/2 stars for a different kind of apocalypse,1321660800,"11 19, 2011",2011,3423,"['may', 'be', 'spoilers.In', 'opening', 'scene', 'see', 'bride', 'running', 'field', 'vines', 'kind', 'are', 'grabbing', 'ankles', 'are', 'flowers', 'hand', 'pond', 'horse', 'sitting', 'footbridge', 'while', 'dynamic', 'symphonic', 'music', 'Richard', 'Wagner', 'dream', 'sequence', 'Then', 'loud', 'rumbling', 'such', 'magnitude', 'two', 'large', 'sub-woofers', 'moved', 'couch', 'rattled', 'pictures', 'was', 'amazing', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'film', 'HDNet', 'channel', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'film', 'then', 'same', 'bride', 'stretch', 'limo', 'new', 'husband', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgard', 'enroute', 'reception', 'castle', 'would', 'make', 'Queen', 'Elizabeth', 'proud', 'film', 'divided', 'two', 'parts', 'named', 'only', 'characters', 'really', 'matter', 'Justine', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'bride', 'Claire', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'sister', 'wife', 'man', 'who', 'estate', 'complete', '18', 'hole', 'golf', 'course', 'played', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland.There', 'mention', 'early', 'unusual', 'star', 'sky', 'large', 'planet', 'making', 'way', 'Earth', 'John', 'Sutherland', 'science', 'planet', 'will', 'come', 'relatively', 'close', 'essence', 'do', 'flyby', 'one', 'overly', 'concerned', 'are', 'radios', 'TV', 'playing', 'certainly', 'panic', 'anyone', 'Are', 'scientists', 'making', 'honest', 'prognosis', 'are', 'shielding', 'population', 'do', ""n't"", 'know.Justine', 'begins', 'act', 'strange', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'history', 'mental', 'illness', 'parents', 'played', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'are', 'bit', 'odd', 'say', 'least', 'Claire', 'be', 'one', 'holding', 'everything', 'together', 'Justine', 'party', 'bath', 'party', 'toast', 'sky', 'new', 'husband', 'attempt', 'romance', 'out', 'sand', 'trap', 'golf', 'course', 'have', 'random', 'sex', 'stranger', 'party', 'Champaign', 'Eventually', 'Justine', 'grave', 'state', 'depression', 'husband', 'estate', 'next', 'morning', 'Clair', 'help', 'Justine', 'regain', 'control', 'emotions', 'stable', 'clear', 'thinking', 'accepting', 'situation', 'planet', 'named', 'Melancholia', 'closer', 'bright', 'blue', 'ball', 'sky', 'Now', 'Claire', 'paranoid', 'sister', 'roles', 'reverse.This', 'entire', 'section', 'film', 'perhaps', 'essential', 'extremely', 'tedious', 'unnecessarily', 'long', 'final', '30', 'minutes', 'however', 'switch', 'gears', 'become', 'increasingly', 'concerned', 'potential', 'collision', 'even', 'when', 'foreign', 'planet', 'be', 'getting', 'smaller', 'drifting', 'away', 'Controversial', 'Danish', 'director', 'Lars', 'von', 'Trier', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'explosions', 'rescue', 'missions', 'falling', 'buildings', 'running', 'animals', 'high', 'winds', 'flooding', 'other', 'typical', 'doom', 'related', 'effects', 'What', 'do', 'get', 'sound', 'huge', 'planet', 'coming', 'Earth', 'go', 'subs', 'again.This', 'movie', 'far', 'perfect', 'middle', 'muddled', 'Von', 'Trier', 'metaphors', 'religion', 'subtext', 'get', 'substance', 'science', 'parents', 'are', 'British', 'only', 'Claire', 'British', 'accent', 'discounting', 'convincing', 'performances', 'Gainsbourg', 'especially', 'Dunst', 'even', 'American', 'accent', 'have', 'admit', 'kept', 'thinking', 'movie', 'long', 'was', 'over']",N/A

Whatever flaws it has are made up for by some of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen on film.The reason it is 4 stars and not 5 is simple-I hate the stupid hand held ""shaky cam"" crap-it is horrible film-making. In fact,I will not watch a movie that is filmed that way. I consider it junk film making. The main issue with it is that it takes me out of the film. Is the first half of the film,the Wedding scene,really too long? Or is it just the stupid shaky cam taking me out of the film over and over? I can be captivated by a character,and then the camera jerks around and I am out of the moment. I really hate it-just say no young film-makers,just say no. Use real movie making skills please.So if I hate the shaky cam so much,why did I sit through this? Because the first 8 and a half minutes may be the most amazing opening I have ever seen on film. It is stunning,and just left me with my jaw on the ground. By the time the shaky cam started,I had to watch no matter what.The first half may drag,but it sets up the second half. As Justine shuts down and Clair cares for her all seems in order(if a bit nuts)but then it all shifts. And there are moments that leave you breathless. When Clair is outside looking at the planet at night,she sees Justine walking out after being almost comatose during this part of the film. As Clair follows her,you expect something awful to be waiting for you. But when what Clair is seeing is revealed,it may be the most beautiful frame of film I have ever seen. Justine naked by the stream,bathing in the light of Melancholia-I have never seen a woman shown in such deep beauty.As the end comes,as Justine becomes clearer even as Clair falls apart,there are moments. When Justine says ""Earth is evil-there's no need to greive for it"" it left me moved. When she says ""We are alone"",I felt it. And when the end comes,the power of it just won't go away.Kirsten Dunst puts on the finest acting performance of the year-there is no other competition. And this movie just won't get out of my head.

Both Melancholia and a movie called Another Earth use this premise. Both are independent films. Both use shaky handheld cameras and the zoom feature where the picture temporarily goes out of focus as they zoom in for a close up. (I think only the Blair Witch Project made sense with that type of filming, since it was about students doing a documentary.) Neither Melancholia nor Another Planet were very good as they come across as amateurish.Melancholia loses clarity in its attempt to be clever. The introduction of Melancholia is artsy, but it simply isn't clear what it's supposed to be (a dream?, a flashback?, a prediction?, a depressed person's thoughts?, the ending of the movie shown first?).Then the movie breaks down into 2 parts, but it was difficult to understand at first whether part 1 took place before part 2 or part 2 was supposed to take place before part 1, since the movie opened with the dream/flashback/ending part. Some movies like Pulp Fiction (great movie BTW) jump around out of sequence and characters who were killed earlier are alive showing a different part of the story. Again, Melancholia is unclear.Part 1 involves a wedding reception, which has some interesting character conflict, but then it stops and introduces Part 2. More confusion. It is not apparent as to whether the time is pre-reception or post-reception or both with the reception itself skipped. Part 2 involves how the characters react to circumstances beyond their control, involving the new planet concept, which isn't mentioned in part 1.Also, Keifer Sutherland's character reaction in Part 2 comes across as unlikely for the character he's playing. His family would have been involved in the choice he made.Anyway, most people think the ending was the best part, probably because *SPOILER ALERT* everyone is put out of their misery including the audience.",1,Seems to be a Student Project,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",2012,2083,"['MAY', 'CONTAIN', 'SPOILERSIt', 'group', 'foreign', 'students', 'were', 'given', 'assignment', 'Make', 'movie', 'using', 'concept', 'new', 'earth-like', 'planet', 'being', 'discovered', 'solar', 'system', 'had', 'been', 'hiding', 'sun', 'Melancholia', 'movie', 'called', 'Earth', 'use', 'premise', 'are', 'independent', 'films', 'use', 'shaky', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'zoom', 'feature', 'where', 'picture', 'temporarily', 'focus', 'zoom', 'close', 'up', 'think', 'only', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'made', 'sense', 'type', 'filming', 'was', 'students', 'doing', 'documentary', 'Melancholia', 'Planet', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'come', 'amateurish.Melancholia', 'clarity', 'attempt', 'be', 'clever', 'introduction', 'Melancholia', 'artsy', 'simply', ""n't"", 'clear', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'dream', 'flashback', 'prediction', 'depressed', 'person', 'thoughts', 'ending', 'movie', 'shown', 'first', '.Then', 'movie', 'down', '2', 'parts', 'was', 'difficult', 'understand', 'first', 'part', '1', 'took', 'place', 'part', '2', 'part', '2', 'was', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'part', '1', 'movie', 'opened', 'dream/flashback/ending', 'part', 'movies', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'great', 'movie', 'BTW', 'jump', 'sequence', 'characters', 'who', 'were', 'killed', 'earlier', 'are', 'alive', 'showing', 'different', 'part', 'story', 'Again', 'Melancholia', 'unclear.Part', '1', 'wedding', 'reception', 'interesting', 'character', 'conflict', 'then', 'introduces', 'Part', '2', 'More', 'confusion', 'not', 'apparent', 'time', 'pre-reception', 'post-reception', 'reception', 'skipped', 'Part', '2', 'how', 'characters', 'react', 'circumstances', 'control', 'involving', 'new', 'planet', 'concept', ""n't"", 'mentioned', 'part', '1.Also', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'character', 'reaction', 'Part', '2', 'unlikely', 'character', 'playing', 'family', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'choice', 'made.Anyway', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'ending', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'probably', '*SPOILER', 'ALERT*', 'everyone', 'put', 'misery', 'including', 'audience']",N/A

1498498,A1AST89AHN17O7,B005S9EI2Y,Omnes,"[3, 7]","Ever since Lars von Trier learned from his mother the truth about his origins, that the father who raised him wasn't his biological father, the Danish director has decided from that day forth to orientate his movies on a quest for honest storytelling and sincere emotions, something that his family always condemned. Starting from the Kingdom, then getting international recognition with Breaking the Waves all the way up to Antichrist, all of Lars' movies have worked on this quest for truth, but also on a mission to move viewers in ways that many would find either pleasant and enriching, or unpleasant and disagreeable.And this is exactly what happens with Melancholia, as Lars once again confronts the Science-Fiction genre rules and stereotypes, and adds human psychology. Instead of conforting us with the usual end-of-the world story told through the eyes of the scientists, military and space agency who try to do everything they can to stop a fly-by from destroying Earth on the third or fourth of July, Lars has decided to show us this end of the world through two sisters, Claire and Justine, whose story happens in the United States, on the golf property of Claire's husband, John. While we hear excerpts, and see an excellent prologue, using the overture of Wagner's Tristan and Isolde under gorgeous visual effects.Although Justine, played by Kirsten Dunst, who totally deserved her palm for Best actress, is considered the main star of the story, it is evident that Claire, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, is also the main star of Melancholia. Indeed, though their lives took different turns in terms of professional and social successes, I think the two sisters are both alike because, as we watch the movie, we find out that they are both extremely anxious people who dread an unpredictable future.To me, the reason why some viewers on Amazon, and on the Web, didn't like Melancholia is probably because Lars doesn't work in the classical sense of storytelling. If Melancholia had been done under a very conventional director and/or scriptwriter, the viewer would have gotten likeable characters, with whom the viewer would identify with; and would have a clear explanation to the characters' lives which would explain all their actions and reactions, especially Justine's as she does things that turn her wedding into another direction. Not only that, Lars never entirely explains the characters' troubled state, though a few hints at the wedding reveal the parents absence to be a major influence. Doing exactly what other controversial directors (i.e: David Lynch, Maurice Pialat, Jonathan Demme, Carl Theodor Dreyer, David Chase, and Michael Haneke) have been doing through their movies, Lars wants us to take a look at the story through an open-mind and to interact with it. Which means that we have to create our own explanations through the subtle details Lars is showing in the movie, which we would then tie up to the missing pieces in this movie that the director has shot like a documentary. Of course this kind of thinking will annoy some viewers who only think of movies as a device to decompress from the week's or job's stress, or to have some quality time with their loved ones. However I think it is much more interesting to watch a movie where the characters act and talk like real individuals; and not like some cardboard stereotypes from the Hollywood Sci-fi and Action genre rules, or get used, just like in the movie Armageddon, as a device to promote some Aerosmith videoclip.For although I do love to watch a commercial Sci-fi flick once in a while, it is nice to see directors try to follow their own voices and give a finger to what some viewers and Hollywood take for granted when they pay their movie tickets and DVDS. And by that I mean that the movie will give them exactly what they want, will explain everything that they need to know, and that they will come out of the theater or living room uplifted, having learned an important moral lesson for the day, ready to take the stresses of lives with a stronger, but sometimes fake and temporary, sense of hope for humanity.If you are ready to get your senses shaken and being told that sometimes, life does not work like a Hollywood movie, then get on it and have fun watching Melancholia, which I did. But if you don't and prefer to hide your anger through short one-star bashings, where you don't clearly explain why you didn't like a movie, please do not watch Melancholia.As Foamy the Squirrel, from the Web cartoon Neurotically Yours, said in the episode ""Germaine for Stupids"" : ""Life is offensive people. It's brutal, annoying, stupid, dirty, and at the end ****ing pointless"". And we need stories to sometimes remember that. So that we can be better prepared when those situations happen. For better or for worse.And besides, I find it ironic that a movie working under a 13 million budget has better visuals effects, scripts and actors, than movies working with 100 millions of dollars of budget (Spider-Man 3, Van Helsing, Armageddon, The Day after Tomorrow, Transformers). Maybe Hollywood should take a note and remember that it is good scripts and directors that make a good movie, not the stars working on it.",5,Two ends of the world told through two

Beautifully photographed and supported by a very good cast, Melancholia is an exercise in severe depression. Consider the dictionary definition of the word: 'Melancholia - a mental condition and especially a manic-depressive condition characterized by extreme depression, bodily complaints, and often hallucinations and delusions'.The film is divided into two parts; 'Justine' and 'Claire'. 'Justine' focuses on Justine's wedding, a depressive surrounded by her also depression ridden family and friends. 'Claire' focuses on Justine's sister, also a depressive who ruminates while a planet appropriately named 'Melancholia' approaches on a collision course with planet Earth. Real or delusion? The viewer cannot say. What can be said is that the film acts out the inner turmoil of depression and ends with the inevitable end of all things.Slow and plodding the film displays very well the inner turmoil of depression.

It was released in cinemas on 29 May 2011 in the Czech Republic on 12 screens as well as other locations like Denmark, Finland and Italy. It soon will come to theaters in the US. Luckily we live in the time that we do and this movie can be streamed before its US theatrical release. I took advantage of this and greatly enjoyed watching this film from the comfort of my own home.I loved Antichrist. In my opinion it is Trier's best work. It was a very disturbing film, yet it had a very strong message with hidden meanings and was all around a beautiful poetic piece of work.Melancholia also is a beautiful film, though I believe I expected more. Antichrist is very deep and constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat because so much is happening and you must decipher the message and meaning of the film. Melancholia is very slow and drawn out. Lars Von Trier did this due to the high anticipation of what will happen, and if it will happen. Trier used the characters anxiety and built upon that and made the viewer feel that anxiety too. Just like Antichrist, Melancholia is a feeling. Your not just watching a movie, eating popcorn and drinking a pop, you are feeling this film.Just a quick summary for those who don't know, Melancholia is a planet which is seemingly coming closer to Earth. This phenomenon happens when Justine (Kirsten Dunst) has just been married to Michael (Alexander Skarsgrd). Justine's sister, Clair (Charlotte Gainsbourg), her husband John (Kiefer Sutherland), and Justine and Clair's mother Gaby (Charlotte Rampling) greatly put pressure on Justine to have this perfect wedding. Justine is not very interested in the wedding reception and seems to come in and out of reality. She is not the type of person to have such a large wedding because she doesn't care. She is a wild girl who seems to have been roped into marrying Michael and marrying into this new family which she is nothing like. There is a lot of drama in this film and for the first half, Melancholia is a back story which the viewer patiently waits for.The cast is amazing and works well together. I really enjoyed Kiefer Sutherlands character. Kirsten Dunst did an amazing job, however her performance seems unbalanced at times, though the character she is playing is unbalanced.After viewing this film I was left speechless due to the raw power of the cast and the images of the film itself. However it made me feel very uneasy, disturbed and very anxious. I immediately thought, ""I never want to watch that again"". Yet I cannot get it out of my mind and I watched it again later that night.

Now comes his latest movie, about the possible impending end of earth, and how it affects a small group of people.""Melancholia"" (130 min.) starts with a 10 min. introduction, in extreme slow-motion, of what the end will look like, when a rogue planet collides with earth. The music that plays along with it is from Richard Wagner, and those introductory minutes reminded me of Stanley Kubrick. After the introduction, the movie plays in two parts, focusing on two women, Justine (played magnificantly by Kirsten Durst) and Claire (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg). It took me a while after the amazing 10 min. introduction to get into the movie, as I think the wedding reception takes too long to play out, but once we get past that, we are in for a treat, as we watch how the main characters deal with/prepare for a ""fly-by"" or possible collision with the rogue planet Melancholia.In my opinion Kirsten Dunst gives by far her best performance yet, but certainly Charlotte Gainsbourg and Kiefer Sutherland (playing the role of Claire's husband) are equally in great form. In all, ""Melancholia"" is a great movie.

1498503,A7DAL9PK7F4M1,B005S9EI2Y,"Paul Donovan ""Paul Donovan""","[0, 1]","Nine Things about the Movie &#8220;Melancholia&#8221; [Denmark, 2011]1.This extraordinary film is the second in director Lars von Trier&#8217;s Depression Trilogy, after &#8220;Antichrist&#8221;. It&#8217;s not a sequel, it is a companion film. It examines similar themes, although this time in a science fiction genre. This movie is not as extreme as &#8220;Antichrist&#8221;, and is easier to understand. But that doesn&#8217;t mean this movie is a walk in the park. After all, it is Lars von Trier.2. Von Trier wrote the movie based on a depressive episode he actually had, and the insight that depressed people tend to be more calm in situations of high pressure - because they are already prepared for the worst result.3. The opening sequence of the film is a breathtakingly beautiful, surreal montage of scenes that represent themes explained during the course of the film. These scenes are juxtaposed with images of the destruction of the Earth as another planet collides into it.4. The first half of the movie takes place at a wedding reception for Justine and Michael at a secluded country estate. The reception slowly unravels, partly because so many attendees make the evening about themselves. But the main problem is that Justine suffers from a debilitating depression, and is unable to hold herself together.5. The second half of the movie takes place at the same country estate, shortly after the wedding. Justine is living there with her sister Claire and Claire&#8217;s family. A rogue planet, aptly named Melancholia, is making a near approach to Earth.6. Claire is terrified that the planet will hit Earth. Her husband tries to convince her that the planet will miss Earth. Justine is calm in her knowledge that Melancholia will actually destroy our planet.7. Charlotte Gainsbourg, who starred in &#8220;Antichrist&#8221;, plays Claire here. Her two roles in these movies make fascinating counterpoints. Kirsten Dunst almost burns a hole through the screen in her portrayal of Justine. It might be her best performance ever.8. Von Trier wasn&#8217;t concerned with making the collision of the two planets scientifically realistic - his point was to illustrate the behavior of the human psyche under extreme circumstances.9.

The story moved along so slow that I skipped through much of the last half of the wedding scene and the next few days. I'm reasonable certain that I missed nothing because every time I stopped to check the story it was still not moving.There was nothing redeeming about the main characters. All of them were annoying and mostly uninteresting and let's face it, if I wanted to see rich, dysfunctional people I could always catch up on the Republican Presidential candidates. The only character I had any sympathy for was Leo, who's only crime was to be born into the worst family ever. Fortunately, Leo didn't have to spend the rest of his life putting up with them.I should stress that the acting in Melancholia was good to great...it's just that the characters and the story were written to be intentionally depressing, so it was like walking into an retirement home or a mental ward where no one was ever going to get well.

As with ""Anti-Christ"", ""Melancholia"" mixes myths and modern psychology.  The idea of a planet behind the sun is actually part of the Mayan myth of the end of the world, where the planet is called Nbiru.  Both of these last Von Trier movies have been strongly compared to Ingmar Bergman, too.  The wedding scenes in ""Melancholia"" do bear comparison to Bergman... revealing very uptight upper crust people who behave like aristocrats.In Bergman's ""Cries and Whispers"", the filmmaker supposedly styled his movie after the paintings of Edvard Munch.  Von Trier, in ""Melancholia"", seems to be imitating Paul Delvaux, or some postmodernist like P.J Crook.  So, the large nocturnal scenes in the movie are stunning visually, and haunting, and there are other great shots, like an overhead of two women riding through great clouds of morning mist.  Visually then, the movie is a triumph.But too much of the rest of it is just annoying.  Jerky movements by hand-held cameras.  Swooning Wagner music, over and over.  Annoying ""geiger counter"" noise, for arty effect.  Annoying symbolic impasses at tiny woodland bridge.  Troubled horses.  Characters and situations that seem to be made up out of thin air.  Who are these people?  Does anyone care?There are good actors completely wasted who just wander through a few scenes-- I'm thinking of John Hurt and Charlotte Rampling.  If you are only interested in style, or if you are a fan of  Matthew Barney's pretensions, then this is a good film for you.

If you know what that means, you don't need to read any reviews or previews to know what you're getting yourself into. You either love or you hate the man's style. If you don't, well, you end up like the people who are giving this a 1-star review because they came in expecting something completely different. All reviews, professional and amateur alike, are biased in regards to his films: hell, even Roger Ebert completely missed the point of Antichrist because his judgement on it was clouded. But heed this - if you want to see Kirsten Dunst naked, you came to the right place. However, if you don't want to see over 2 hours of a slow-paced crescendo of depression and madness, you probably wanna skip it.This movie is about that: depression. Reactions to heartbreaking events, overwhelming guilt and despair, impending doom, how we handle stress, deal with trivial things in the midst of chaos, things like that. It's the feel-bad hit the winter and everything about it screams masterpiece but it's not for everyone. Mind you, it's nowhere near as graphic as Antichrist or, in my opinion, as saddening as Dancer in the Dark but it's still a downer if you're not in the mood to sit down and really watch a film about the physical/metaphorical end of the world. Hopefully you are, though, because it's one of the best movies I've seen in recent memory. The acting for the most part is spot on (save for Alexander Skarsgrd who seems like he's reading his lines from off-screen), the cinematography is really beautiful, and the subtle sound design feels haunting throughout. For a movie that takes its time, you never feel like it's drudging, which is remarkable since the first half of the movie plays a LOT like Festen, a dogme 95 staple, which DID feel that way a lot of the time to me. If you're on the fence about this movie, gauge it against the other art-house movies you've seen or let the fact that it's bound to grab award noms like crazy sway your decision but, please, don't expect a traditional climax and feel ripped off when you didn't get your slow motion explosions or Sigur Ros music on the last freeze frame.

I had no sympathy for any of them, nor did I care about their coming fate. Basically the characters paralleled the fate of the planet and both made for one big downer. Did Lars von Trier make a great movie? For me, no. I would have preferred seeing the characters explode in reaction to their coming fate. Sutherland doing Dunst as opposed to killing himself. I mean if its inevitable that you're all going to die, have some fun-get drunk, screw, take an acid trip, love everyone around you-anything but lay down and die like a bunch of whimpering losers.And the portrayal of Earth's demise was just as weak, very unrealistic, and a huge let down on Trier's part as a director. Has this guy never cracked a science book? A planet that size slamming into Earth, come on. The earthquakes, the tidal waves, the fires and devastation-he barely touched on the atmosphere being sucked off. Like the characters, he sent the planet out like a whimpering baby with no fire or zest.

The soundtrack which was primarily from Robert Wagner's Wagner: Tristan und Isolde which is so powerful and dramatic in it's own right, adds to the mood of this movie. Shaky camera, particularly in the beginning: annoying, but adds to the mood. Deep bass, thundering sounds and music soundtrack: powerful and effective. Although some reviewers complained it was slow, for me it seemed a lot shorter than it's actual time of 2 hours and 16 minutes. It's definitely a deep &#34;artsy&#34; type of movie, so if you don't like that sort of thing you probably won't like this movie. In the first 6 or 7 minute preview, that moves in slow motion, you get a synopsis of the whole film. You know what's going to happen before the actual story begins.The rest of the movie plays out in two parts. The first part, &#34;Justine&#34;, who is played by Kirsten Dunst, shows the bride and her new husband played by Alexander Skarsgard, on their way to their lavish wedding reception at the home of her sister, Clair, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg and brother-in-law, played by Kiefer Sutherland. Justine seems to be in a state of very deep depression, which we know is because of the impending crash of the planet Melancholia into Earth. What should be a happy affair begins to deteriorate right away, from the ride there in a stretch limo which has problems navigating the winding road to her sister and brother-in-law's mansion. By the end of the night she's destroyed her marriage and her state of mind has deteriorated even further.The second part &#34;Clair&#34; shows her sister, who after trying to help Justine to get herself together, begins to fall into a depression of her own. The planet is getting closer and everyone seems more aware. Interestingly, no one is glued to the TV, watching the 24 hours news stations. Her husband, John (Kiefer Sutherland) is an amateur astronomer and is convinced that Melancholia is going to bypass the Earth, but come close enough for a splendid view. He is the optimist in this story. As we watch Clair become more fearful and depressed, Justine seems to accept their fate and becomes more calm and reassures her young nephew, Leo, Clair and John's son.The movie is heavy with symbolism. Several people have commented on the scene where Justine and her new husband are trying to get the stretch limo up the winding road to their reception. I wonder if the read symbolizes life and it's twists and turns and the limo, people using wealth in an attempt to navigate it and finding that it can cause more problems than expected. In another scene the sticks representing a cave seemed more than a little strange.

It establishes this from the opening sequences that go from the observations of an approaching giant planet to a young bride who abandons her groom at the altar to go off to have sex with a stranger much to the consternation of her sister who is very prim, proper and orderly. This introduces another theme as the sisters represent the major opposing forces at work in the universe, order and chaos, the alternating between disintegration and integration speaking to some fundamental concerns of the human dilemma; what is the nature of our individual &#8220;reality&#8221; within the scope of infinitely larger framework of a shared existence; why are we here; is there a God of order and justice and does this God have a master plan or is it all meaningless?

Great selection of actors delivers set of characters that help define two sister Claire and Justine in all their complexities.  This film is shot at the beautiful chateau and everything about the film is visually pleasing: from the scenes in part 1 where Justine, newly married young woman, has her wedding reception funded and organized by her sister and her brother-in-law; to the scenes in part 2 where some shots of a beautiful planet Melancholia in all its fantasic shine is simply breathtaking.  Many of the scenes from this film remind me of the beautiful scenes from the movie ""Tree of Life"".At her wedding reception Justine does her best to appear happy: her groom is handsome and attentive, her sister plans her wedding to the smallest detail, the event is catered and organized in a beautiful castle with garden that is zen-like.  But Justine is not herself and she manages in a single night to alienate herself from her family, break up her new marriage and say some things to her employer that very few people would dare to speak out loud - ever.  Justine's emotional meltdown is overtaking her and all around her.In the second part, Justine's sister Claire decides to take her on after Justine has nervous breakdown.  Justine, a houseguest with indefinite need for rest, joins Claire's family.  Claire's husband John who is an amateur astronomer tells them about planet called Melancholia that is dangerously close to earth.  It is uncertain if this planet will hit earth an cause destruction, or if it will barely miss the collision.  As Claire panicks on how best to manage this impending disaster, Justine calmy observes the world around her.  To her, world is dead already and the only capacity she has left in her is to transition the living into this new stage of being when one is so separated from their surroundings they can only stand on the sideline and help others transition into the new state of existance.Personally, I enjoyed this film, but I know it is not meant for wide audiences.  It is an art movie that tackles some sensitive emotional, psychological and philosophical questions.

His films are not simple, and his characterizations are rich. The DVD extras are plentiful, including moments with the reclusive von Trier, explaining how he wrote it after a bout with clinical depression. Certainly, these are generally unlikeable characters, but its interesting how Claire (always in control) melts down and Justine (insecure and spoiled) trade characters. Sure, the action involved the privileged rich, whose money means nothing in the end, but there have already been plenty of ""end of the world"" movies about regular everyday people. If I didn't care for the characters involved, I was intrigued by the characterizations given by Kirsten Dunst and, especially, Charlotte Gainsbourg.

1498522,A21VR7M8O55EF6,B005S9EI2Y,Robin Friedman,"[6, 9]","Lars von Trier's new film, ""Melancholia"" explores depression and its consequences -- loneliness, alienation, fear -- on a personal level inside the heart and also on a cosmic level. The movie was featured at the 2011 Cannes film festival where the leading actress, Kirsten Dunst, (Justine) received the best actress award. During the festival, von Trier made some highly inflammatory comments and was banned from further appearances at the event. ""Melancholia"" was my first von Trier film.The movie is lengthy and divided into two sections, each of which is devoted to one of the two sisters, Justine and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who are the main characters. The story is set against the backdrop of what appears to be an impending collision between the earth and a newly discovered planet aptly called Melancholia. Astronomers see the danger (Remember, most scientists now believe that many millions of years ago, an asteroid collided with the earth killing the dinosaurs and other large forms of life.) but they believe, mistakenly, that the two planets will eventually just pass each other by.  In the movie, the protagonists play out their own lives and their own melancholia against what, as becomes increasingly apparent, will be a cataclysmic catastrophe.In the first part of the movie, Justine is to be married to a handsome, propserous young man, Michael, (Alexander Skarsgard).  The wedding festivities, sponsored by Claire's husband John (Kiefer Sutherland) are lavish and expensive and take place in a decadent old castle. John is not a professional astronomer but has a strong interest and apparently considerable education in the subject. He tends to discount the fears of some scientists that the earth and Melancholia will colide. The wedding festival is set aginst a tone of personal foreboding as well as Justine's long separated parents quarrel and make a scene, and Justine's boss interjects business into the celebration. But the main problem is Justine. She does not love John and she does not understand herself. Justine has relations with someone else during the celebration and her husband-to-be leaves her.The second part of the movie focuses on Claire, and on her relationship with Justine, with her husband John, and with their young son, Leo. As the movie progresses, Justine becomes more able to deal with her depression while Claire's conditions, initially the stronger of the two, becomes worse. The changing position of the sisters is juxtaposed against the approach of Melancholia which becomes increasingly prominent and certain as the movie progresses. When it becomes apparent to all that doom will occur, John kills himself while Justine, although taking a nihilistic cynical approach to life and its end on earth, provides a measure of strength and comfort to Leo. She behaves strongly and with dignity during what she believes will be the end of life in the universe and on earth.The acting in the film is excellent throughout and tension is developed through even with some slow moments. The movie has the feel of lush, indulgent 19th Century Romanticism with Wagner's music featured throughout.  The photography and special effacts add a great deal to the movie as the approach of Melancholia to the earth is captured erily, both in the sky and in the reactions of animals on earth. A sense of vertigo is introduced in the last portion of the movie with the camera work which offers a sense of the impending collision.  The final apocalyptic scene is convincingly portrayed.""Melancholia"" is a subtle worthwhile movie with its themes of loss, sadness, and loneliness on both a cosmic scale and a personal scale.Robin Friedman",4,Internal and External Melancholia,1322006400,"11 23, 2011",2011,3671,"['Lars', 'von', 'Trier', 'new', 'film', 'Melancholia', 'depression', 'consequences', 'loneliness', 'alienation', 'fear', 'personal', 'level', 'heart', 'also', 'cosmic', 'level', 'movie', 'was', 'featured', '2011', 'Cannes', 'film', 'festival', 'where', 'leading', 'actress', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Justine', 'received', 'best', 'actress', 'award', 'festival', 'von', 'Trier', 'made', 'highly', 'inflammatory', 'comments', 'was', 'banned', 'further', 'appearances', 'event', 'Melancholia', 'was', 'first', 'von', 'Trier', 'film.The', 'movie', 'lengthy', 'divided', 'two', 'sections', 'devoted', 'one', 'two', 'sisters', 'Justine', 'Claire', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'who', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'story', 'set', 'backdrop', 'what', 'be', 'impending', 'collision', 'earth', 'newly', 'discovered', 'planet', 'aptly', 'called', 'Melancholia', 'Astronomers', 'see', 'danger', 'Remember', 'most', 'scientists', 'now', 'believe', 'many', 'millions', 'years', 'ago', 'asteroid', 'collided', 'earth', 'killing', 'dinosaurs', 'other', 'large', 'forms', 'life', 'believe', 'mistakenly', 'two', 'planets', 'will', 'eventually', 'just', 'pass', 'other', 'movie', 'protagonists', 'play', 'out', 'own', 'lives', 'own', 'melancholia', 'what', 'becomes', 'increasingly', 'apparent', 'will', 'be', 'cataclysmic', 'catastrophe.In', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'Justine', 'be', 'married', 'handsome', 'propserous', 'young', 'man', 'Michael', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgard', 'wedding', 'festivities', 'sponsored', 'Claire', 'husband', 'John', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'are', 'lavish', 'expensive', 'take', 'place', 'decadent', 'old', 'castle', 'John', 'not', 'professional', 'astronomer', 'strong', 'interest', 'apparently', 'considerable', 'education', 'subject', 'discount', 'fears', 'scientists', 'earth', 'Melancholia', 'will', 'colide', 'wedding', 'festival', 'set', 'aginst', 'tone', 'personal', 'foreboding', 'as', 'well', 'Justine', 'long', 'separated', 'parents', 'quarrel', 'make', 'scene', 'Justine', 'boss', 'business', 'celebration', 'main', 'problem', 'Justine', 'not', 'love', 'John', 'not', 'understand', 'Justine', 'relations', 'someone', 'else', 'celebration', 'husband-to-be', 'leaves', 'her.The', 'second', 'part', 'movie', 'Claire', 'relationship', 'Justine', 'husband', 'John', 'young', 'son', 'Leo', 'movie', 'Justine', 'more', 'able', 'deal', 'depression', 'Claire', 'conditions', 'initially', 'stronger', 'two', 'worse', 'changing', 'position', 'sisters', 'juxtaposed', 'approach', 'Melancholia', 'increasingly', 'prominent', 'certain', 'movie', 'When', 'apparent', 'doom', 'will', 'occur', 'John', 'Justine', 'taking', 'nihilistic', 'cynical', 'approach', 'life', 'end', 'earth', 'measure', 'strength', 'comfort', 'Leo', 'strongly', 'dignity', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'end', 'life', 'universe', 'earth.The', 'acting', 'film', 'excellent', 'tension', 'developed', 'even', 'slow', 'moments', 'movie', 'feel', 'lush', 'indulgent', '19th', 'Century', 'Romanticism', 'Wagner', 'music', 'featured', 'photography', 'special', 'effacts', 'add', 'great', 'deal', 'movie', 'approach', 'Melancholia', 'earth', 'captured', 'erily', 'sky', 'reactions', 'animals', 'earth', 'sense', 'vertigo', 'introduced', 'last', 'portion', 'movie', 'camera', 'work', 'sense', 'impending', 'collision', 'final', 'apocalyptic', 'scene', 'convincingly', 'portrayed', 'Melancholia', 'subtle', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'themes', 'loss', 'sadness', 'loneliness', 'cosmic', 'scale', 'personal', 'scale.Robin', 'Friedman']",N/A

1498524,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B005S9EI2Y,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 9]","Despite the fact that it deals with such heady topics as depression, mental illness and the end of the world, ""Melancholia"" may well be the most ""accessible"" movie Lars Von Trier has ever made. Which really isn't saying all that much given that the vast majority of his oeuvre consists of works that are, to put it mildly, cerebral, arty, and non-commercial with a vengeance. In fact, this haunting, visionary masterwork is a bit like what ""2012"" might have been had it been designed as a bleak, metaphysical art-house film instead of as a crowd-pleasing, SGI-driven blockbuster.Like ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Melancholia"" spends the first third of its running-time at a wedding, introducing us to the main characters and the various problems they face. Labeled ""Justine,"" Part 1 focuses on an attractive young woman (Kirsten Dunst) who obviously suffers from a debilitating form of clinical depression. Though she is clearly trying her best to put on a happy face for the guests who have come to see her tie the knot, Justine can't hide the crushing sadness that resides at her core. In addition, Justine and her sister, Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who is desperately trying to pull off a memorable event for her sister despite all the difficulties, also have to deal with the familial stress caused by a cantankerous father (John Hurt) and a hopelessly embittered mother (Charlotte Rampling).After this deceptively prosaic opening, ""Melancholia"" throws us for a loop in Part 2, simply titled ""Claire."" For we discover that, in addition to the fact that Justine's depression has become almost crippling in its effect on the young woman, scientists have discovered an unknown planet - dubbed Melancholia - hitherto hiding on the other side of the sun that has recently broken out of its orbit and is now on a possible collision course with Earth. Needless to say, this grimmest of all possibilities hangs like a pall over the lives of the characters, like a death sentence passed on a race that daily denies its inherent fragility in the face of massive, impersonal forces of nature and a universe of crushing vastness.The rogue planet becomes a symbol for all the unspecified fears and dangers, both real and imaginary, that we face everyday as a species - a species that, while it may be uniquely aware of its own mortality, is, nevertheless, willing to overlook that fact as the only means of making it through the day. Indeed, we make a pact with ourselves and each other that we won't acknowledge our own mortality. It's only at certain rare moments that we are forced as individuals to come face-to-face with the ephemeral nature of our existence - only now, thanks to Melancholia, all of humanity is having to do so at the same time. In many ways, Justine, with her depression that existed long before the threatened extinction of the planet, may be the most ""rational"" of all the characters in her reaction to the world around us - and, by extension, the cosmic end of humanity. And it is indeed she, at the end, who manages to not only cope best with the onrushing doom but to provide the strength the others need to come to terms with their fate.As an apocalyptic fable, ""Melancholia"" possesses all the stark beauty and intellectual rigor of Ingmar Bergman at his finest. Von Trier also shares the Swedish master's ability to draw profoundly layered performances out of a superb ensemble cast. For, in addition to the actors and actresses already mentioned, there is stunning work here by ""24""'s Kiefer Sutherland and ""True Blood""'s Anthony Skarsgard as well.No review of ""Melancholia"" could possibly hope to do the movie justice, for no words can come close to conveying the visceral impact the film has on its audience. It is a work of art that burrows deep into the viewer's psyche and forces us to ponder - however unwillingly - issues involving our own lives and how we choose to live them.Mesmerizing and unforgettable.",5,A mind-blowing masterwork,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,3932,"['fact', 'such', 'heady', 'topics', 'depression', 'mental', 'illness', 'end', 'world', 'Melancholia', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'most', 'accessible', 'movie', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'ever', 'made', 'Which', 'really', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much', 'given', 'vast', 'majority', 'oeuvre', 'works', 'are', 'put', 'mildly', 'cerebral', 'arty', 'non-commercial', 'vengeance', 'fact', 'haunting', 'visionary', 'masterwork', 'bit', 'what', '2012', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'been', 'designed', 'bleak', 'metaphysical', 'art-house', 'film', 'instead', 'crowd-pleasing', 'SGI-driven', 'Deer', 'Hunter', 'Melancholia', 'first', 'third', 'running-time', 'wedding', 'introducing', 'main', 'characters', 'various', 'problems', 'face', 'Labeled', 'Justine', 'Part', '1', 'focuses', 'attractive', 'young', 'woman', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'who', 'obviously', 'suffers', 'debilitating', 'form', 'clinical', 'depression', 'clearly', 'trying', 'best', 'put', 'happy', 'face', 'guests', 'who', 'have', 'come', 'see', 'tie', 'knot', 'Justine', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hide', 'crushing', 'sadness', 'core', 'addition', 'Justine', 'sister', 'Claire', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'who', 'desperately', 'trying', 'pull', 'off', 'memorable', 'event', 'sister', 'difficulties', 'also', 'have', 'deal', 'familial', 'stress', 'caused', 'cantankerous', 'father', 'John', 'Hurt', 'hopelessly', 'embittered', 'mother', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', '.After', 'deceptively', 'prosaic', 'opening', 'Melancholia', 'loop', 'Part', '2', 'simply', 'titled', 'Claire', 'discover', 'addition', 'fact', 'Justine', 'depression', 'become', 'almost', 'crippling', 'effect', 'young', 'woman', 'scientists', 'have', 'discovered', 'unknown', 'planet', 'dubbed', 'Melancholia', 'hitherto', 'hiding', 'other', 'side', 'sun', 'recently', 'broken', 'out', 'orbit', 'now', 'possible', 'collision', 'course', 'Earth', 'Needless', 'say', 'grimmest', 'possibilities', 'hangs', 'pall', 'lives', 'characters', 'death', 'sentence', 'passed', 'race', 'daily', 'inherent', 'fragility', 'face', 'massive', 'impersonal', 'forces', 'nature', 'universe', 'crushing', 'vastness.The', 'rogue', 'planet', 'symbol', 'unspecified', 'fears', 'dangers', 'real', 'imaginary', 'face', 'everyday', 'species', 'species', 'may', 'be', 'uniquely', 'aware', 'own', 'mortality', 'nevertheless', 'willing', 'overlook', 'fact', 'only', 'making', 'day', 'Indeed', 'make', 'pact', 'ourselves', 'other', 'wo', ""n't"", 'acknowledge', 'own', 'mortality', 'only', 'certain', 'rare', 'moments', 'are', 'forced', 'individuals', 'come', 'face-to-face', 'ephemeral', 'nature', 'existence', 'only', 'now', 'thanks', 'Melancholia', 'humanity', 'having', 'do', 'so', 'same', 'time', 'many', 'ways', 'Justine', 'depression', 'existed', 'long', 'threatened', 'extinction', 'planet', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'rational', 'characters', 'reaction', 'world', 'extension', 'cosmic', 'end', 'humanity', 'indeed', 'end', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'cope', 'best', 'onrushing', 'doom', 'provide', 'strength', 'others', 'need', 'come', 'terms', 'fate.As', 'apocalyptic', 'fable', 'Melancholia', 'stark', 'beauty', 'intellectual', 'rigor', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'finest', 'Von', 'Trier', 'also', 'shares', 'Swedish', 'master', 'ability', 'draw', 'profoundly', 'layered', 'performances', 'superb', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'addition', 'actors', 'actresses', 'already', 'mentioned', 'stunning', 'work', 'here', '24', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'True', 'Blood', 'Anthony', 'Skarsgard', 'well.No', 'review', 'Melancholia', 'could', 'possibly', 'hope', 'do', 'movie', 'justice', 'words', 'can', 'come', 'close', 'conveying', 'visceral', 'impact', 'film', 'audience', 'work', 'art', 'deep', 'viewer', 'psyche', 'forces', 'ponder', 'however', 'unwillingly', 'issues', 'involving', 'own', 'lives', 'how', 'choose', 'live', 'them.Mesmerizing', 'unforgettable']",N/A

Great colorful characters in her folks, boss, brother-in-law Kiefer S, and the dysfunction between them all. Interesting how the entire thing takes place at this castle/estate, which becomes increasingly cut off from the rest of the world, with fewer and fewer characters as the movie goes on.It seems that every detail in this film was well thought out and quite intentional.

It is not for everyone.  It's a film about depression and about the possible end of the world, so many will see this film as a total downer (though, strangely, I felt pretty good after it was over - watching it was cathartic and visceral for me).Also, the story moves very slowly.  The film is as much about mood and visuals as about plot, and maybe more so.

1498529,AAOF195P95ZVC,B005S9EI2Y,Ross E. Nelson,"[6, 8]","The way this movie is drawn out, you might not believe it capable of chest-tightening tension and anxiety.  It is, though.  The ending is foreseeable, after a false turn or two, and is a soul-shattering moment.Let's go back to the film's beginning, and what is called ""Justine: Part I.""  Justine (played by Kirsten Dunst who's lovelier than I've ever seen her before) has just married and is at the wedding reception.  All of Part I (which is longer than Part II) is in or around this reception.  Somehow Justine has snared a man who clearly had little idea he was marrying someone who sorely needs to be hospitalized for the blackest melancholy, or some other mental disorder.  She repeatedly absents herself, disgraces her newly wed husband, makes love to her boss's nephew on the front lawn, and in general carries on to the point of needing a good slapping or a good medication.Her sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is a paragon of patience and good hosting, trying as she does to keep Justine from flying apart.  Unfortunately for me, Part I had a lot of murmured dialogue I couldn't catch, and since the second part was easily audible I blame the movie.  The director might be trying to imitate real life, but he's got to realize that he's filming for an audience, not for the actors in front of the camera.  Claire's husband John (Kieffer Sutherland) is the poor soul who also has to put up with his sister-in-law's irritating behavior while complaining constantly about the cost of the wedding and reception.  He has a secret, but is the person the audience could most identify with.The second part is titled ""Claire,"" and in fact revolves around her and her struggle to keep a stiff upper lip concerning her sister, and especially her son.  The wandering planet officially named Melancholia comes into its own now, a beautiful, ominous orb in the sky that gets bigger and bigger.  John sloughs off concern; the scientists have it all figured out he tells Claire, and they say it will miss the earth.  He's still buying emergency supplies on the sly, though.Justine seems to be rejuvenated by the new planet, at one point melancholia-bathing naked in its greenish-blue reflected light.  It's Claire's turn now to suffer from melancholia, this time from a planet that seems to spell doom for the earth--indeed for all living things in the universe, according to Justine.  As the planet nears, she claims to ""know things,"" one of which is that life on earth is alone, all alone.  When it goes, life itself goes.  That kind of deep gloom sets the final stage, in which a strangely vibrant Justine still manages to be a royal pain in Claire's neck.Is this the despair that the deeply melancholy feel?  Are there two types of melancholy, a personal inborn one for some people and one that can be forced on otherwise perfectly healthy folks through exterior circumstance?  The movie is beautifully shot with rich color and eye-catching shapes.  It's somewhat claustrophobic since there's nowhere to hide, and Claire's anguish is searing.

The movie was overly long and took me three attempts to get through it as it kept putting me to sleep. I would suggest fast forwarding through the whole first part - the failed wedding.Now for the positive. The movie was visually striking and once you accept it as a psychological commentary, the symbolism becomes apparent. There is a lot more to it than the basic characters. While I agree with one review which commented upon how depressed people might behave more calmly in the face of disaster, I think that review entirely missed the point of the effects of melancholia upon people other than those who suffer directly. For example, the approaching planet, Melancholia, sucked part of the atmosphere away, causing strain and lethargy in everyone. Then there was a scene in which the depressed person beat a horse in an effort to get it to cross a bridge it would not cross. I thought that the horse beating scene was carried out by the wrong character and would have been more fitting for the frustrated Keifer Sutherland when I first thought about it, but on further thought I see that the scene was meant to symbolize the melancholic's failed attempts to act only to try to please others and not break out of despair.All in all, the movie was rather interesting, which gets the three stars I gave. It has a lasting effect which might take time to sink in. If I had written the review immediately after watching, I would have given it only two stars, but the haunting effect a few days later has led me to see it in a better light.",3,Not an action flick,1341964800,"07 11, 2012",2012,1568,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'negative', 'movie', 'was', 'overly', 'long', 'took', 'three', 'attempts', 'get', 'kept', 'putting', 'sleep', 'would', 'suggest', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'whole', 'first', 'part', 'failed', 'wedding.Now', 'positive', 'movie', 'was', 'visually', 'striking', 'once', 'accept', 'psychological', 'commentary', 'symbolism', 'apparent', 'lot', 'more', 'basic', 'characters', 'agree', 'one', 'review', 'commented', 'how', 'depressed', 'people', 'might', 'behave', 'more', 'calmly', 'face', 'disaster', 'think', 'review', 'entirely', 'missed', 'point', 'effects', 'melancholia', 'people', 'other', 'who', 'suffer', 'directly', 'example', 'approaching', 'planet', 'Melancholia', 'sucked', 'part', 'atmosphere', 'away', 'causing', 'strain', 'lethargy', 'everyone', 'Then', 'was', 'scene', 'depressed', 'person', 'beat', 'horse', 'effort', 'get', 'cross', 'bridge', 'would', 'not', 'cross', 'thought', 'horse', 'beating', 'scene', 'was', 'carried', 'out', 'wrong', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'fitting', 'frustrated', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'when', 'first', 'thought', 'further', 'thought', 'see', 'scene', 'was', 'meant', 'symbolize', 'melancholic', 'failed', 'attempts', 'act', 'only', 'try', 'please', 'others', 'not', 'break', 'despair.All', 'movie', 'was', 'rather', 'interesting', 'three', 'stars', 'gave', 'lasting', 'effect', 'might', 'take', 'time', 'sink', 'had', 'written', 'review', 'immediately', 'watching', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'only', 'two', 'stars', 'haunting', 'effect', 'few', 'days', 'later', 'led', 'see', 'better', 'light']",N/A

I'm accustomed to being mentally, visually and intellectually stimulated and hypnotized by his films almost immediately and it took longer for that to happen this time around.  The story of Melancholia is a meditation on that subject as symbolized by a young woman who suffers from that condition and a planet also called by that name.  I won't give away too much of the story but can confirm it will not disappoint, its a very romantic film for Trier, with exquisite shots and probably his most accessible storyline to date.  His penchant for offending certain viewers isn't anywhere to be found in this film and its not heavily layered with meaning and contradiction like many of his other projects so the interpretation of the film is quite clear.  The film is a lyrical mediation on sadness, fear, anxiety and acceptance of reality and his characters are psychologically well portrayed.  Ms. Dunst is cast against type as she portrays the depressed main character and the woman pulls it off with remarkable finesse.

1498547,A1DHFQP9G5F7LY,B005S9EI2Y,Stephen C. Bird,"[8, 11]","This film knocked my socks off the first time I saw it.  Shortly thereafter, I saw it once again in the cinema.  As some other Amazon reviewers have noted, ""Melancholia"" is best experienced on the big screen (""Big & Loud"", to paraphrase one reviewer) -- Especially for the opening & closing sequences.  Despite its imperfections -- There is a logical arc of progression contained within this film, that can be summarized as follows: (1) the Prelude / Premonition / Dance of Death between the Planets; (2) the Wedding, The Sisters, The Gradual Disappearance of Everyone besides 3 Principal Characters; & (3) the Simultaneously Horrifying & Moving Ending.  The conclusion of ""Melancholia"" reminded me, once again, that the Cruel Cosmos, as well as Amoral Mother Nature, do not care whether we humans exist or not and will roll over us like a steamroller on a whim.  Other Amazon reviewers have compared this film to ""The Tree of Life"" -- But frankly, TOL was a Disney-esque experience compared to ""Melancholia"".  Despite its being controversial (controversy coming naturally to Von Trier, the button-pushing provocateur) -- I also enjoyed LVT's previous outing, ""Antichrist"".  ""Antichrist"" made me realize that Von Trier seems to have entered his masterwork phase.My theory about the intensely dismissive and negative reactions to ""Melancholia"" by many other Amazon reviewers is this: If one does not want to deal with subject matter that is deep, disturbing, metaphorical, mystifying & symbolic -- One won't like this film.  Apparently all those 1-star reviewers who wanted their money back were angry about having been seduced by a concept -- That could have offered them a poetic & visionary representation of a potentially frightening reality.  And so this picture is a love-it-or-hate-it experience, as is to be expected from any great work of art built on a definitive & insightful point of view.  Secondly -- A familiarity with / taste for European film is advised before viewing this film, given the differences of sensibility, imagery and pacing between European and American cinema.  For instance -- I'm not the biggest fan of Andrei Tarkovsky -- But anyone who had seen his pictures before having seen ""Melancholia"" would be better equipped to deal with its slow pace.  In closing -- Although I have previously heard ""Tristan & Isolde"" & other music by Wagner utilized in the scores of films by various directors (Chabrol, Francis Ford Coppola, Fassbinder, Fellini) -- Von Trier's use of ""Tristan & Isolde"" in both the opening & closing of ""Melancholia"" was genius.  Thus the comparisons made to the equally brilliant opening of Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" are completely justified.Stephen C.

1498549,AX668BUQRHI7C,B005S9EI2Y,stephie,"[3, 5]","I think I was expecting a lot more action in this movie because I ended up being rather disappointed during most of it. And a little annoyed by Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and how she behaved. Maybe that's a testament to her acting ability that she was so easily able to irk me. Or I just don't like her, but I've liked her in other movies so it's probably not that.I hate whispery dialog and this movie is full of it so maybe I missed something important that might have explained some things that didn't make sense. A lot didn't make sense but at least you know going in how it's going to end so there's something to look forward to. In the beginning I was rooting for the big sha-bang at the end, because the first half of movie just drags and it's just unfortunate it takes so long to get there. And if the first half is too slow, too whispery, and too long for you too, getting to the end takes f-o-r-e-v-e-r.I read another review about this movie that said it helps knowing the character Justine suffers from melancholia, and maybe it would have but I guess we're supposed to know one of them does considering the name of the movie but Melancholia is also the name of the planet coming towards Earth, so on the flip side maybe not. It might have helped to see previews too, though we know previews show only the best parts usually.About three quarters of the way through I started to feel this anxious feeling. Because until the last few minutes or so you really don't know for sure if the end (that you read in the movie description) will come. It's really easy to believe Claire's (Charlotte Gainsbourg) husband (Kiefer Sutherland, especially if you're a 24 fan!) when he assures her that Melancholia will do a fly by and not hit earth.Too easy.But soon you know. And then the end is coming and maybe you feel what they feel, and what seemed like a bad movie initially (for the first hour, really) has an ending that redeems itself somewhat.Only somewhat.Visually it was beautiful, no denying that. But too dark --and I don't mean the context, I mean the lighting in the movie in many scenes was so dark you couldn't really see anything. Implications aside, a little light is better than ""hey guess what that is"" in most cases. Especially when combined with the whispery dialog and scenes that don't seem to make sense while you're watching them.When this movie ended I thought ""ugh stupid movie!"" but, having thought about it some more, whatever the point was supposed to be, (over my head or not) it's still with me. The visuals, the characters, the idea of a planet on a possible collision course with Earth.So for the less high brow crowd that won't likely dissect and explain every nuance and angle, maybe that was the point. To make a statement. (any statement, like look at me! watch my movie! remember me!!)OK, point taken.Just know, for those who haven't seen it, this is not your average movie. It's slow, quiet, dark, and the big sha-bang you read about in the description and reviews --- well you'll have see it --- but you have a long way to go to get there, and, maybe like me, you'll give in a little, get into it some, and feel that slow build of the end coming.",3,"It's a very long, very slow ride to a fulfilling end",1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,3182,"['think', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'more', 'action', 'movie', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'most', 'little', 'annoyed', 'Justine', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'how', 'behaved', 'Maybe', 'testament', 'acting', 'ability', 'was', 'so', 'easily', 'able', 'irk', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'other', 'movies', 'probably', 'not', 'that.I', 'hate', 'whispery', 'dialog', 'movie', 'full', 'maybe', 'missed', 'something', 'important', 'might', 'have', 'explained', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'lot', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'least', 'know', 'going', 'how', 'going', 'end', 'so', 'something', 'look', 'forward', 'beginning', 'was', 'rooting', 'big', 'sha-bang', 'end', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'just', 'drags', 'just', 'unfortunate', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'there', 'first', 'half', 'too', 'slow', 'too', 'whispery', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'getting', 'end', 'f-o-r-e-v-e-r.I', 'read', 'review', 'movie', 'said', 'knowing', 'character', 'Justine', 'suffers', 'melancholia', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'guess', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'know', 'one', 'considering', 'name', 'movie', 'Melancholia', 'also', 'name', 'planet', 'coming', 'towards', 'Earth', 'so', 'flip', 'side', 'maybe', 'not', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'see', 'previews', 'too', 'know', 'show', 'only', 'best', 'parts', 'usually.About', 'three', 'quarters', 'way', 'started', 'feel', 'anxious', 'feeling', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'so', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'sure', 'end', 'read', 'movie', 'description', 'will', 'come', 'really', 'easy', 'believe', 'Claire', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'husband', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'especially', ""'re"", '24', 'fan', 'when', 'Melancholia', 'will', 'do', 'fly', 'not', 'hit', 'earth.Too', 'easy.But', 'soon', 'know', 'then', 'end', 'coming', 'maybe', 'feel', 'what', 'feel', 'what', 'seemed', 'bad', 'movie', 'initially', 'first', 'hour', 'really', 'ending', 'somewhat.Only', 'somewhat.Visually', 'was', 'beautiful', 'denying', 'too', 'dark', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'context', 'mean', 'lighting', 'movie', 'many', 'scenes', 'was', 'so', 'dark', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'anything', 'Implications', 'aside', 'little', 'light', 'better', 'hey', 'guess', 'what', 'most', 'cases', 'Especially', 'when', 'combined', 'whispery', 'dialog', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'sense', ""'re"", 'watching', 'them.When', 'movie', 'ended', 'thought', 'ugh', 'stupid', 'movie', 'having', 'thought', 'more', 'whatever', 'point', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'head', 'not', 'still', 'visuals', 'characters', 'idea', 'planet', 'possible', 'collision', 'course', 'Earth.So', 'less', 'high', 'brow', 'crowd', 'wo', ""n't"", 'likely', 'dissect', 'explain', 'nuance', 'angle', 'maybe', 'was', 'point', 'make', 'statement', 'statement', 'look', 'watch', 'movie', 'remember', 'OK', 'point', 'taken.Just', 'know', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'not', 'average', 'movie', 'slow', 'quiet', 'dark', 'big', 'sha-bang', 'read', 'description', 'reviews', 'well', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'have', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'get', 'there', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'give', 'little', 'get', 'feel', 'slow', 'build', 'end', 'coming']",N/A

On the contrary, if strong dislike is what one feels or thinks, it's perfectly OK. But reading many one star reviews, just like another reviewer stated, they say more about the reviewer than the movie itself...I was amused by the one who said that the movie's only quality is Kirsten Dunst breasts.Melancholia presents 2 depressed main characters within a science fiction background. There is no conscious choice from the filmmaker or script for the viewer to like these characters, they are just who they are; likewise, for science fiction fans, there is no explanation about the new planet approaching, it's just approaching.We have an 8 minute introduction, no narration, no dialogue, only a dreamlike sequence depicting the events that will develop and uses the prelude of Tristan und Isolde; this music is the only one throughout the whole movie, at first it may sound repetitive, but it's so beautiful and its applied in key moments so this does not matter at the end. The first part is dedicated to Justine, a bride who is not sure about her commitment and who suffers severe depression. This first half is basically a drama, the only information about the menacing planet is that there is a new bright star in the constellation Scorpio.I must mention about the frequently used term ""character development"". For many casual reviewers the main problem of many films is the lack of ""character development""; perhaps they think this 'development' consists that the viewer must know almost everything about the main protagonists, where they come from, what are their motivations or their drive, goals, etc.. I believe this is a misconception. For me, character development is simply that the viewer understands the characters regardless of the knowledge about them. During the first part of Melancholia I knew when I needed that Justine's boss is a pig, her sister Claire is psychorigid and the groom is deeply in love but weak. I did'nt need a lot of dialogue and exposition to know that, one just knows as the celebratory events unfold.The second half is about Claire and now the planet Melancholia is mentioned as a possible menace, there are no TV news clips or people panicking in cities as in a summer blockbuster movie, only apprehension about the situation. What else should one feel about the possibility the world will end in the next few days? Electricity is gone and the only means of information is a telescope and the planet getting bigger in the sky. Justine, who had an emotional breakdown before clears a bit her mind (surely she just wanted to die anyway and planet Melancholia will be just fine for her) and now the role reverses with Claire who begins to fall apart. The final scene is daunting.Now, being a sci-fi fan I must also comment about the science fiction quality of this film. Of course, this movie is so much closer to hard sci-fi, particularly, Solaris. There's even a painting shown in the introduction that looks so much as one used in a scene in Solaris. Melancholia's two sisters set of mind is practically the same from the main couple in Solaris (both original and the 2002 remake). About the science, the planet just comes quickly from behind of the Sun, I assume for some reason it was not detected before, so it's a surprise; of course, such a planet would alter with anticipation gravitational forces in the Solar System and therefore planets' orbits, but director Lars Von Trier is not concerned about these details, the new planet is just a device for the human drama and his vision to develop.The special FX scenes are well done and as I commented before, the final scene is unnerving, majestic and even tragically sad, how Claire and Justine join and share the final instant of not only their lives, but the world's. Just the few seconds before the end of the world (and the movie), the view and sound is quite impressive.Acting is fine from all involved and Dunst portrays her role convincingly. About the camera movement, I had no problem at all, it's just a style of filmmaking and not taken to the extreme as in movies like Cloverfield or Blair Witch Project.Amidst too many pointless movies in every genre (even science fiction) that the gargantuan movie giant industry spits each year, Melancholia is like a refreshing but cool breeze, that feels nice if you have the patience to stand in it for a while and contemplate.",5,A view about depression and the End of the World,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",2014,4476,"['person', 'totally', 'entitled', 'her/his', 'opinion', 'one', 'forced', 'like', 'film', 'music', 'art', 'contrary', 'strong', 'dislike', 'what', 'one', 'thinks', 'perfectly', 'OK', 'reading', 'many', 'one', 'star', 'just', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'say', 'more', 'reviewer', 'movie', 'was', 'amused', 'one', 'who', 'said', 'movie', 'only', 'quality', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'breasts.Melancholia', 'presents', '2', 'depressed', 'main', 'characters', 'science', 'fiction', 'background', 'conscious', 'choice', 'filmmaker', 'script', 'viewer', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'who', 'are', 'likewise', 'science', 'fiction', 'fans', 'explanation', 'new', 'planet', 'approaching', 'just', 'approaching.We', 'have', '8', 'minute', 'introduction', 'narration', 'dialogue', 'only', 'dreamlike', 'sequence', 'depicting', 'events', 'will', 'develop', 'prelude', 'Tristan', 'und', 'Isolde', 'music', 'only', 'one', 'whole', 'movie', 'first', 'may', 'sound', 'repetitive', 'so', 'beautiful', 'applied', 'key', 'moments', 'not', 'matter', 'end', 'first', 'part', 'dedicated', 'Justine', 'bride', 'who', 'not', 'sure', 'commitment', 'who', 'suffers', 'severe', 'depression', 'first', 'half', 'basically', 'drama', 'only', 'information', 'menacing', 'planet', 'new', 'bright', 'star', 'constellation', 'Scorpio.I', 'must', 'mention', 'frequently', 'used', 'term', 'character', 'development', 'many', 'casual', 'reviewers', 'main', 'problem', 'many', 'films', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'perhaps', 'think', ""'development"", 'viewer', 'must', 'know', 'almost', 'everything', 'main', 'protagonists', 'where', 'come', 'what', 'are', 'motivations', 'drive', 'goals', 'etc..', 'believe', 'misconception', 'character', 'development', 'simply', 'viewer', 'characters', 'regardless', 'knowledge', 'first', 'part', 'Melancholia', 'knew', 'when', 'needed', 'Justine', 'boss', 'pig', 'sister', 'Claire', 'psychorigid', 'groom', 'deeply', 'love', 'weak', ""did'nt"", 'need', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'exposition', 'know', 'one', 'just', 'celebratory', 'events', 'unfold.The', 'second', 'half', 'Claire', 'now', 'planet', 'Melancholia', 'mentioned', 'possible', 'menace', 'are', 'TV', 'news', 'clips', 'people', 'panicking', 'cities', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'only', 'apprehension', 'situation', 'What', 'else', 'should', 'one', 'feel', 'possibility', 'world', 'will', 'end', 'next', 'few', 'days', 'Electricity', 'gone', 'only', 'information', 'telescope', 'planet', 'getting', 'bigger', 'sky', 'Justine', 'who', 'had', 'emotional', 'breakdown', 'clears', 'bit', 'mind', 'surely', 'just', 'wanted', 'die', 'anyway', 'planet', 'Melancholia', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'fine', 'now', 'role', 'Claire', 'who', 'fall', 'apart', 'final', 'scene', 'daunting.Now', 'being', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'must', 'also', 'comment', 'science', 'fiction', 'quality', 'film', 'course', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'closer', 'hard', 'sci-fi', 'particularly', 'Solaris', 'even', 'painting', 'shown', 'introduction', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'used', 'scene', 'Solaris', 'Melancholia', 'two', 'sisters', 'set', 'mind', 'practically', 'same', 'main', 'couple', 'Solaris', 'original', '2002', 'remake', 'science', 'planet', 'just', 'quickly', 'Sun', 'assume', 'reason', 'was', 'not', 'detected', 'before', 'surprise', 'course', 'planet', 'would', 'alter', 'anticipation', 'gravitational', 'forces', 'Solar', 'System', 'therefore', 'planets', 'orbits', 'director', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'not', 'concerned', 'details', 'new', 'planet', 'just', 'device', 'human', 'drama', 'vision', 'develop.The', 'special', 'FX', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'commented', 'final', 'scene', 'unnerving', 'majestic', 'even', 'tragically', 'sad', 'how', 'Claire', 'Justine', 'join', 'share', 'final', 'instant', 'not', 'only', 'lives', 'world', 'Just', 'few', 'seconds', 'end', 'world', 'movie', 'view', 'sound', 'quite', 'impressive.Acting', 'fine', 'involved', 'Dunst', 'role', 'convincingly', 'camera', 'movement', 'had', 'problem', 'just', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'not', 'taken', 'extreme', 'movies', 'Cloverfield', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project.Amidst', 'too', 'many', 'pointless', 'movies', 'genre', 'even', 'science', 'fiction', 'gargantuan', 'movie', 'giant', 'industry', 'year', 'Melancholia', 'refreshing', 'cool', 'breeze', 'nice', 'have', 'patience', 'stand', 'while', 'contemplate']",N/A
1498552,A3KKOJ6T4DCBDT,B005S9EI2Y,"technoguy ""jack""","[6, 8]","The opening prologue makes us aware of the approaching cataclysm,Melancholia the planet is hurtling towards Earth. The movements of the spirit parallels astronomical events,showing us the relations of humans to the world at large. Time seems to stand still or to slow to adagio.Kirsten Dunst seems to float in the water like Ophelia. Breughel's Hunters in the Snow burns,referencing Tarkovsky's Solaris.The soul and planet Earth stand in for each other.Von Trier has said the film is about his own depression.But expressing it can be a positive.Two sisters,Justine(Dunst) and Claire(Gainsborough)are polar opposites: Justine, the younger one, is sensitive and prone to depression, while her older sister Claire is rational, protecting of her sister, nurturing and tolerant.We have a family wedding melodrama in Dogme vein(luxurious version).There is emotion and humour,but also suffocation with Justine the outsider.Wagner's Tristan und Isolde gives a romantic tenor to the bleakness.The two sisters could be seen as two sides of the same person.Claire is rationalistic,controlling,represents normality,caring for her sister in her helpless state of depression, for whom the world is too much.However Claire has something to lose,her illusions,she would panic with catastrophe. While Justine roasts(with the glow of melancholy) in the shadow of death,Claire is numbed motionless inexpectation of the planet's impact.Claire is unable to deal with the reality. There is no place in her world for an instant end to everything, for her son never seeing adulthood, all futures preempted. But for Justine ""the Earth is a cruel place that is nothing to mournfor.""Justine's vision unclouded by illusions that protect the ego from reality,means she does not fear death.She gets stronger,cold but comforting,catastrophe's enliven her. Melancholy casts its raw light on things,destroying distinctions between life and death.The parallel between Earth and humankind disintegrates. The film's slow pace, its recurring leitmotif-like sentences and images in place of a narrative, offer the viewer a condition rather than a story. Here, Wagner's music, with its characteristic stasis, its unwillingness to develop freely, serves Trier as an appropriate backdrop. There is no other way to put it: this film is the phenomenon of melancholy itself. Call it existentialist: we are ruthlessly thrown into the universe with no chance of escape.

Its very hard for me to confirm how many times a movie has actually made me force myself to stay awake promising to myself that the Plot will pick up somewhere along the way. In this movie it never does. First off I have to criticize the cameraman. I mean seriously wobbly, just all around terrible. It was one of those movies that reminded me that these were actors on a set. I like a movie that sucks you in and  makes you feel like you are watching something for real, like you are almost their. Peter Jackson for instance does this quit well in his films (Like King Kong, which was a master Piece). Now granted that comparison may not be far as the two movies are completely different. HOWEVER let me use Peter Jacksons' ""King Kong"" as an example of what a good movie NEEDS for it to be worth a damn, Character Development, Back Story, DETAIL, Connection to the story, plot, and characters. I will say this as well. In THIS movie Dunst played her part as well as one could. In fact the acting wasn't at all bad, what was however was the damn script. It was painfully dull. Also the lighting in the movie was bad. Even on max brightness at times you didn't know what you were looking at. Another serious problem was that all the characters did a 360 and swapped places, and you have no back story on any of them. I mean one scratches there head thinking what the hell are they talking about more than half the time because from beginning to end we know nothing about any of the characters aside from there personalities. We don't know why they are the way they are, and every thing starts spinning right at the beginning. Its like the writer wrote a middle and ending and no beginning and poof that was good enough for a movie. Also a 1 hour scene of wedding drama....wow, it was terrible. The  story never progressed either. Its like we have the middle part of the story and the ending is beginning in the last quarter of the movie and then that's it. Total disappointment here. Not happy one bit. Thankfully I rented it before buying so I saved myself the trouble. The actors were the only ones who did their part.

1498563,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B005S9EI2Y,Turfseer,"[14, 33]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Melancholia' is not only the name of the condition that afflicts Danish Director Lars Von Triers' protagonist, Justine, but it's also the name of the planet that has just come out from hiding behind the sun, and is on a collision course with earth. If you're anticipating watching another sci-fi thriller, this is not the film to go and see. Like this year's other entry in the indie pseudo sci-fi category, 'Another Earth', the focus is not on that annoying other planet up in the sky, but on the conflicts between the afflicted parties down on earth.Von Triers divides 'Melancholia' into two parts that focus on two very different sisters, Justine and Claire. In Part I, Justine is a mid-level advertising copywriter, who arrives two hours late to her wedding with groom Michael, at brother-in-law John's estate. Just about everyone is speaking American English, so I assume the setting is supposed to be somewhere in the US, but it's not really clear. Justine is suffering from severe depression for unknown reasons and there are some suggestions that she may have psychic powers.One explanation for Justine's blues is that she comes from a highly unpleasant family. Don't ask for any back story, you'll just have to be content to accept the fact that Von Triers' characters are inherently dysfunctional. There's a method to Von Triers' madness and I will attempt to shed some light on it by the end of this review. Suffice it to say at this juncture that in Von Triers' weltanschauung, all the so-called 'normal' people, are uncaring, and in some cases, plain 'evil', and the 'abnormal', those suffering from so-called mental illnesses, are actually quite sane.Justine's relatives, friends and business associates are designed to offend our sensibilities as they all come across as self-centered and misanthropic. The worst offender is probably Justine's sarcastic, divorced mother, who tactlessly condemns the institution of marriage in a wedding toast, and expectorates numerous insults in front of the assembled guests, including the bride and groom. The father isn't much better, a card-carrying alcoholic who promises Justine, in the midst of her worst moment of decompensation, that he'll stay the night, but later leaves a note to his daughter, apologizing for leaving, due to a change of mind. There's also Justine's creepy boss, who attempts to humiliate one of his new employees in front of her, only to provoke an enraged Justine to send the boss to an early exit from the festivities. How does the new employee respond to Justine sticking up for him? He promptly has sex with her on the golf course. Passive schlub husband Michael, decides to leave Justine, with nary a protest. Lest I forget, brother-in-law John has no tolerance for the mother's bi-polar-like outbursts and at one point gathers up her luggage and dumps it outside the front entrance of the estate, until passive-aggressively reversing himself, and bringing the luggage back up to her room.The second half of 'Melanchalia', Part 2, focuses on Justine's sister, Claire, who lives with John and their young son, Leo, at the estate. Claire is seemingly the most 'rational' and 'normal' of anyone who we've met so far, so when Von Triers transforms her into an abject coward, then we began to see what's going on here. It's no secret that Von Triers created 'Melancholia' as a result of his treatment for depression. When his therapist suggested that depressed people are more 'calm' in moments of crisis, that gave Von Triers license to affirm what he knew all along--that he, otherwise known as one of the ""depressed oppressed"", are better than all those nasties, he's been pitted against during his entire life. Of course one must accept Von Triers' supposition that all the antagonists we meet in 'Melancholia', are not caricatures, but multi-dimensional portraits, of living, breathing, human beings.Evidence of Justine's 'triumph', can be found in Claire's reaction to her impending doom. As 'Melancholia' (the planet that is), is about to take the lives of everyone on earth, past nut-job Justine calmly pulls herself together and miraculously becomes the 'strong one'. When she finds John after he commits suicide, she calmly covers him with hay in the barn and doesn't freak out. She then builds a protective 'magic cave' for Leo, so he won't be afraid at all when earth completely implodes. Meanwhile, once 'normal' Claire, is frantically driving the family golf cart (the cars don't work because of earth's new found, screwed up, gravitational pull) with Leo into town, so she can get ""help"" (of course the implication is that she's 'lost it' because of course, how can you get 'help', when the earth is about to collide with another planet?).One can view 'Melancholia' as a poor man's, reverse 'Persona', the classic 1966 film by Ingmar Bergman. Von Triers echoes Bergman's preoccupation with the differences between two women from different classes, different walks of life. In Persona, a lower class nurse, cares for an upper class, well known actress who suffers from mental illness. The 'simpler' nurse turns out to be more 'real' than the actress, who feigns mental illness to cover for her narcissism. Here, the seemingly afflicted Justine, proves to be much stronger than her sister, the wife of a millionaire, who, when faced with the fact that earth is about to be destroyed, is unable to muster the courage to face death, bravely.If there's any saving grace in 'Melancholia', it's the iconic series of magisterial images in slow motion, mainly seen at the beginning of the film. Otherwise, the actors are hemmed in by the pretentious screenplay, which make them all seem like laughable caricatures. Von Triers' use of a bombastic Wagner score only adds to his reputation as a director with adolescent sensibilities, who doesn't even come close to approaching the sensibilities of the world's master filmmakers.",1,"Von Triers' 'Melancholia', aspires to Ingmar Bergman-like heights, but ends up as pretentious, pseudo art house fare",1328918400,"02 11, 2012",2012,5953,"['***', 'review', 'may',

Subconsciously becoming sick to prevent worse things happening in the family, such as a total family breakdown.The IP is actually doing pretty well at the beginning of the film, but is going to an extremely elaborate wedding planned by her sister. The family demand that she be 'happy' is another rejection of her self, putting more pressure onto her to be content so that the family can feel okay. Her sister no doubt insisted or shamed her into having this kind of a huge wedding...By making her 'wellness' the center of the family attention, they focus on HER as the problem, and if she can be fixed all will be well....thus avoiding awareness of the immense pain they all feel and of just how bad things truly are....also it is a way of blaming her for their dysfunctions...a kind of emotional release value, letting off steam when it gets too hot.Of course this focus on and demand for her 'happiness' only enrages and traps her, and acts pushes her into relapse.She probably choose her groom because, under it all, he was like her family though not as obviously.The scene when he wants to have sex, and she asks 'can I have a moment?' Yet he does not understand, he wants what he wants, and his ego is at stake. He abandons and uses her just as the family did...there is NO one there for her as she is disintegrating, the abandonment of both her husband and father are devestating, but not unfamiliar.No matter what she does, she is trapped. The system is designed like that.Her sister alternately treats her with tenderness and care, and then berates and bullies her when she can't get into the tub without help, or when she isn't ready to go riding, or when she is late for the wedding, starts to fall apart at the wedding after being in contact with her family again, of course...That is why she can say, ""You think I'm afraid of a planet?""
