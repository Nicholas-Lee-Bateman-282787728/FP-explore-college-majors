479476,A2NFTFQYW8GXIQ,6305810109,A. Andersen,"[3, 3]","Character actor Richard Farnsworth earned an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor in 1978 for his work in COMES A HORSEMAN.  His current performance as Alvin Straight in a magical, lyrical and lovely film, THE  STRAIGHT STORY, is even more extraordinary.  His face is a map of a  lifetime and is so incredibly expressive that, like Garbo, one almost does  not need dialogue to know what he's thinking and feeling. This is a film  about decent people being decent to each other - that's a rarity, eh?  I've seen just over half of the 35 Oscar nominated films from 1999 and only  this and MUSIC OF THE HEART contain no violence - what a comment on our  film world.  Alvin Straight sets out to see a brother who may or may not  have survived a stroke - to end a feud and set the record as straight as  his name.  He does this on a John Deere tractor, traveling from Iowa to  Wisconsin, since his age precludes an active driver's license.  Along the  way he meets a number of people, including himself, and leaves a bit of  wisdom, honesty and perspective in all the lives he touches.  Sissy Spacek  is also exceptional as his developmentally delayed adult daughter - she  deserved an Oscar nom in support for her performance here.  This is a  beautiful film.  Thank you, Director Lynch, and thank you, Mr. Farnsworth,  for sharing so much beauty and meaning with your fellow humans.",5,Farnsworth outstanding in warm and lyrical film.,958003200,"05 11, 2000",2000,1385,"['Character', 'actor', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'Nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', '1978', 'work', 'COMES', 'A', 'HORSEMAN', 'current', 'performance', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'magical', 'lyrical', 'lovely', 'film', 'THE', 'STRAIGHT', 'STORY', 'even', 'more', 'extraordinary', 'face', 'map', 'lifetime', 'so', 'incredibly', 'expressive', 'Garbo', 'one', 'almost', 'not', 'need', 'dialogue', 'know', 'what', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'film', 'decent', 'people', 'being', 'decent', 'other', 'rarity', 'eh', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'just', 'half', '35', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'films', '1999', 'only', 'MUSIC', 'THE', 'HEART', 'contain', 'violence', 'what', 'comment', 'film', 'world', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'out', 'see', 'brother', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'survived', 'stroke', 'end', 'feud', 'set', 'record', 'as', 'straight', 'name', 'John', 'Deere', 'tractor', 'traveling', 'Iowa', 'Wisconsin', 'age', 'active', 'driver', 'license', 'way', 'number', 'people', 'including', 'bit', 'wisdom', 'honesty', 'perspective', 'lives', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'also', 'exceptional', 'developmentally', 'delayed', 'adult', 'daughter', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nom', 'support', 'performance', 'here', 'beautiful', 'film', 'Thank', 'Director', 'Lynch', 'thank', 'Mr.', 'Farnsworth', 'sharing', 'so', 'much', 'beauty', 'meaning', 'fellow', 'humans']",The Straight Story VHS

(And, as with &quot;Elephant Man&quot; and the pairing of Lynch's name with producer Mel Brooks, it's disorienting to see Lynch's name here following Walt Disney's.)  I wondered, as with the other movie, how Lynch would avoid the inevitable sentimental finish, and, as he did before, he ends this one powerfully by going the opposite way you'd expect.Farnsworth underplays to the point where you might wonder if he's playing at all, but try to imagine anyone else handling the role better.  There are moments when all I remember is his face, particularly those eyes, and those are the most powerful moments of all.  (Such a loss.)

From Anne of Green Gables, to The Natural, and even Into the Night, Farnsworth has always done a sure-fire method of humble acting. His gifts, even while under physical pain, were just as evident in the Straight Story.The 73 year old, cigar loving, veteran, Alvin Straight finds out that his brother is sick, and must go on a journey of forgiveness. He and his brother have resentment in their past and have avoided one another for decades because of a simple argument. Sissy Spasek plays his loving and mentally handicapped daughter. This is one of her best performances (next to &quot;A place for Annie&quot;).The mode of transport? An old John Deere lawn mower. Along the way he encounters many people and touches all of their lives. Most memorably the life of a teenage runaway, who is afraid to tell her parents that she is pregnant.There is one scene that closely reminds me of the &quot;Carl tells his Past&quot; portion in the opening of Sling Blade. It is truly haunting as Straight tells one of his new found friends (also a veteran - Straight tells him he could see it in his eyes) about a memory from the war.The ending of the Straight Story is one of the most rewarding endings you will ever see.

479481,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6305810109,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 28]","With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that I love.  This film felt like a ""blind date"" gone bad.  The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous.  Everything in this film seemed wrong.  Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about.  This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.What initially pulled me away from this film was the technique that Lynch used to introduce us to Alvin and his daughter Rose.  Alvin lying on the ground because he can't get up, the clich&eacute; use of taking him to the doctor letting us know that he is deteriorating, while bringing us the central conflict of his brother falling ill was just too much in such a little time frame.  Spacek's depiction of Rose seemed unbalanced and rather stale.  She brought nothing fresh to this rather emotional character outside of a stutter and some unfunny scenes.  I expected so much more from Spacek with her timeline of cinema, but this felt like something she did on an afternoon instead of providing us with the intensity that she harbors.  Then, to add more fuel to the fire, there was Richard Farnsworth.  Again, he isn't a horrible actor, but it felt like Lynch picked him because he fit the role physically, but alas, couldn't master it mentally.  Farnsworth seemed out in left field for a majority of his time onscreen.  I couldn't tell if he was trying to remember his lines or if he was truly in character.  His eyes seemed watery for everything which brought too much emotion to those little scenes, and seemed to bring not enough by the dramatic ending.  His entire speech about his time overseas at war was pathetic, while some will quote it as being his speech of a lifetime, I saw it as babble (and no, I am not that insensitive - I just felt it could have been handled by a stronger, more professional actor).  The rest of the cast seemed equally as unimportant.  I wanted Lynch to either go 100% for this film or none at all, but alas, it felt as if he just half-ed his way through this heap.Speaking of David Lynch, where did he go in this film?  There were some scenes that I witnessed that screamed the director that I love, but then there were others that just felt like he took pointers from Ken Burns' ""Looking at America"" class.  I hated the sweeping cornfields that seem to plague this film.  Instead of keeping us by Alvin's side throughout his journey, Lynch gave us a repetitive view of farming and corn.  There is nothing wrong with this technique when making the epic that one desperately needs to see once in a while, but when the same images were used over and over again, I nearly felt Lynch was humoring us with the dulls of Iowa instead of being the majestic all the critics raved about.  I think he could have been stronger with his filler than what he was with this film.  He needed something to couple with the authenticity of Alvin, but the stock-footage that he chose to show was definitely not the balance one could hope for.  I also felt there was more to be discussed with the friends that he met along the way.  Alvin was a walking storybook, filled with the way that he led his own life instead of listening to those around him and learning from their experiences as well.  Lynch made Alvin very closed minded, which did not create a strong protagonist for the feature.  Alvin was a strong character, but I needed more with this story.  I wanted him to make choices, learn new things, and bring that to his brother's table when they eventually met.  I felt cheated when this never occurred and felt as if Lynch was saying that this journey through Americana was that we could learn from Alvin, and not vice-versa.Overall, I wasn't stunned by this picture.  I thought Lynch could have been stronger with his choice of direction and cast instead of what seemed like he just ""played it safe"".  The overplayed stock footage of cornfields infuriated me due to the lack of time that we could have been spending with Alvin.  Speaking of Alvin, why couldn't he have been a stronger, better-rounded character?  I felt after watching this film that Lynch had duped me into believing that he wanted to paint a picture of America, but instead gave us nothing more than soft music, recycled images, and stock characters.  The stories were interesting to listen to, but brought nothing fresh to the table.  I must admit that the brotherly love moment brought a tear to my eye (since I have a brother as well), but why couldn't we focus on this further.  Lynch made the riff between the two brothers seem like a toss in the pan, when it was the central focus of this film.  The Straight Story could have been a strong tale bringing in a new image for Lynch, but instead it felt jagged and old.  I could suggest one viewing for this film, any further, and you will see how dull those cornfields really claim to be!Grade: ** out of *****",2,The worst part of being old is rememberin' when you was

It is an extraordinary work of art that is as surprising as it is richly rewarding.  If ever there was a case of ""less is more,"" this is it.The story, (both bizarre and fact-based), is almost Shaker-esque in its simplicity.  Alvin Straight, a 73-year-old man in failing health from Laurens, Iowa, rides a garden tractor 320 miles to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin in hopes of making peace with his dying, estranged brother Lyle.  On the way, the incredibly slow way, he meets nice people and we learn a great deal about him.  (Imagine pitching that to a producer!)Retired stuntman Richard Farnsworth plays Alvin to perfection.  The hard years are visible; his craggy face resembles a well-worn baseball glove, although there's sparkle, even mischief, in his eyes.  When Alvin smiles it's the smile of a man who has seen all the hardship life has to offer and still chooses to embrace it.  Straight is laconic but unlike most characters, every word matters and reverberates with authenticity.The pacing in this picture is faultless, through vignettes played out in chance encounters we come to understand Straight and the complex trials he's endured, as well as his need to make amends with brother Lyle.  These small scenes are played out on a vast, sumptuous visual canvas of American farmland, gigantic John Deere harvesters cut broad swathes as Alvin put-puts in the foreground.The reliable Angelo Badalamenti provides a lovely, non-intrusive score while Sissy Spacek shines as Alvin's daughter.  But the truly stunning thing about The Straight Story is that it was directed by David Lynch, demonstrating once and for all that Lynch is capable of creating movie magic without resorting to dwarfs talking backwards and dogs dining on severed ears.  This is a profoundly humanistic and gentle film that moves with slow confidence - no cheap tricks.

479487,A6JJ7CD3RN1W5,6305810109,a writer,"[7, 7]","Who would have expected David Lynch, the director of films from the bizarre underbelly of America (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks) to come up with such a beautifully simple movie about the need for redemption in  life, and do it without corniness or coarseness? Yet, Lynch has created one  of the most touching movies I've seen in a long time - while avoiding the  saccharine effects of Hollywood fare. ""The Straight Story"" is literally a straight story, about an old man named Alvin Straight. As a ""road movie"" it runs a straight line from start to finish, but  along the way Lynch throws in some of his best scenes, pacing and dialogue, which keep the movie from being too maudlin or flat. Alvin Straight, a retired Iowa farmer in the receding twilight of his life, sets out to see  his ailing brother, whom he's not seen or spoken to in years, in Wisconsin. He can't drive and won't take the bus, so he hitches up a makeshift trailer to his battered tractor and makes the journey, at 15 mph, across the  heartland to see his brother. Cue the heart-swelling scenes of Iowa cornfields and the uplifting music by Lynch pal Angelo Badalamenti. But none of it plays predictably. Straight encounters some unique people on the  road - some who might seek his help and wisdom, some who could help him -  and it's in this context that Lynch works his quirky magic. The old cliche  about life being a journey gets an elegant and charming makeover. Alvin reveals, through conversations with strangers, that he's led a  tumultuous and cantankerous life; but even now, his stubbornness both drives him and keeps him on the straight path to his brother's doorstep. We know  that 10 years of bad blood have separated the two men; will Straight's  brother finally accept him once he arrives? Will Straight own up to his  past mistakes? Will the film end on a falsely-derived feel-good ending? Lynch avoids the traps skilfully and gives us some very interesting  characters along the way. Richard Farnsworth plays Straight beautifully: a mixture of quiet stubborness mastered by resignation. His weathered face  says a lot. Sissy Spacek gives a deft performance as Straight's mildly  retarded daughter. She has a life full of her own regrets and mistakes: she tries to be strong and helpful for her aging father, yet we learn she has children of her own somewhere, taken away by the state long ago. There are other characters who play small but interesting roles: a young runaway  girl who shares a roadside camp with Straight; a barman who offers Straight  a beer and a painful memory; a family straight out of a Norman Rockwell tableau, and, in a classic Lynchian scene, an unhinged woman motorist who hits a deer and flips out in front of the bemused Straight. The dialogue is right on target, being neither contrived nor melodramatic. In one scene, shot from a middle distance, we see Alvin talking to someone, but we can't quite hear them. Rather than mike it so that every line is  audible, Lynch chose instead to keep the viewer outside. That and the somewhat off-kilter camera angles makes the look and tone of ""The  Straight Story"" so refreshing: not everything has to be explained or  conventional. Lynch isn't putting heroic words in Alvin's mouth, nor is he  saying that being old and decrepit is somehow noble. There are no weird,  malevolent or supernatural beings here. Lynch has (for once - maybe not for  the last time) given us a look at real life, the way it meanders along with no seeming purpose, but whose little events add up to something greater.",5,A thoroughly enjoyable film about age and redemption,952732800,"03 11, 2000",2000,3561,"['Who', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'David', 'Lynch', 'director', 'films', 'bizarre', 'underbelly', 'America', 'Eraserhead', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'come', 'up', 'beautifully', 'simple', 'movie', 'need', 'redemption', 'life', 'do', 'corniness', 'coarseness', 'Lynch', 'created', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'avoiding', 'saccharine', 'effects', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'Straight', 'Story', 'literally', 'straight', 'story', 'old', 'man', 'named', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'road', 'movie', 'straight', 'line', 'start', 'finish', 'way', 'Lynch', 'best', 'scenes', 'pacing', 'dialogue', 'keep', 'movie', 'being', 'too', 'maudlin', 'flat', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'retired', 'Iowa', 'farmer', 'receding', 'twilight', 'life', 'out', 'see', 'ailing', 'brother', 'whom', 'not', 'seen', 'spoken', 'years', 'Wisconsin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drive', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'bus', 'up', 'makeshift', 'trailer', 'battered', 'tractor', 'journey', '15', 'mph', 'heartland', 'see', 'brother', 'Cue', 'heart-swelling', 'scenes', 'Iowa', 'cornfields', 'uplifting', 'music', 'Lynch', 'pal', 'Angelo', 'Badalamenti', 'none', 'predictably', 'Straight', 'unique', 'people', 'road', 'who', 'might', 'seek', 'help', 'wisdom', 'who', 'could', 'help', 'context', 'Lynch', 'quirky', 'magic', 'old', 'cliche', 'life', 'being', 'journey', 'elegant', 'charming', 'makeover', 'Alvin', 'reveals', 'conversations', 'strangers', 'led', 'tumultuous', 'cantankerous', 'life', 'even', 'now', 'stubbornness', 'straight', 'path', 'brother', 'doorstep', 'know', '10', 'years', 'bad', 'blood', 'have', 'separated', 'two', 'men', 'will', 'Straight', 'brother', 'finally', 'accept', 'once', 'Will', 'Straight', 'own', 'up', 'past', 'mistakes', 'Will', 'film', 'end', 'falsely-derived', 'feel-good', 'ending', 'Lynch', 'traps', 'skilfully', 'very', 'interesting', 'characters', 'way', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'Straight', 'beautifully', 'mixture', 'quiet', 'stubborness', 'mastered', 'resignation', 'weathered', 'face', 'lot', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'deft', 'performance', 'Straight', 'mildly', 'retarded', 'daughter', 'life', 'full', 'own', 'regrets', 'mistakes', 'be', 'strong', 'helpful', 'aging', 'father', 'yet', 'learn', 'children', 'own', 'somewhere', 'taken', 'away', 'state', 'long', 'ago', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'play', 'small', 'interesting', 'roles', 'young', 'runaway', 'girl', 'who', 'shares', 'roadside', 'camp', 'Straight', 'barman', 'who', 'Straight', 'beer', 'painful', 'memory', 'family', 'straight', 'Norman', 'Rockwell', 'tableau', 'classic', 'Lynchian', 'scene', 'unhinged', 'woman', 'motorist', 'who', 'deer', 'out', 'front', 'bemused', 'Straight', 'dialogue', 'right', 'target', 'being', 'contrived', 'melodramatic', 'one', 'scene', 'shot', 'middle', 'distance', 'see', 'Alvin', 'talking', 'someone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hear', 'Rather', 'mike', 'so', 'line', 'audible', 'Lynch', 'chose', 'instead', 'keep', 'viewer', 'somewhat', 'off-kilter', 'camera', 'angles', 'look', 'tone', 'Straight', 'Story', 'refreshing', 'not', 'everything', 'be', 'explained', 'conventional', 'Lynch', ""n't"", 'putting', 'heroic', 'words', 'Alvin', 'mouth', 'saying', 'being', 'old', 'decrepit', 'somehow', 'noble', 'are', 'weird', 'malevolent', 'supernatural', 'beings', 'here', 'Lynch', 'once', 'maybe', 'not', 'last', 'time', 'given', 'look', 'real', 'life', 'way', 'seeming', 'purpose', 'little', 'events', 'add', 'up', 'something', 'greater']",The Straight Story VHS

What a treat to witness his ability to convey a lifetime of emotions without saying a word, with a series of  telling looks , sideways glances, and using his sheer innate ability to  ""emote"" to tell his story. This movie shimmers with a fountain of pent-up,  heart-felt, but tragically unspoken human emotions. Along the way, we also  get to know and appreciate his emotionally challenged daughter, played well  by Sissy Spacek. But this trip is really a Richard Farnsworth bravura  one-man show.  And what a show it is!We trip the light fantastic with  him as he sets out to see a long-lost brother at the end of life, and we  get to share in his ersatz adventures with an eclectic cast of all  too-ordinary yet extraordinarily beautiful losers he encounters along the  way.  Of course, his trip on the John Deere is a trip toward himself and  toward discovering a lot of things he needs to know to complete his life's  journey. This is adult entertainment for the whole family, because it has  such a wonderful ring of truth and integrity hovering over it, and an  insight about life that lingers even after it's over.

It is a warm and gentle movie that is not overly sentimental. Every scene has just the right tone.Fans of David Lynch might be astonished when they  hear that their master made a G-rated movie, but to my mind, it is one of  Lynch's best films. I think that sometimes, his films are too freaky for  their own good, but in &quot;The Straight Story&quot;, he completely serves  his screenplay and trusts his actors. Richard Farnsworth is really  masterful as Alvin Straight. His performance is so effective that he almost  moved me to tears. He shows us a man that hasn't lost his dignity despite  being old and handicaped. But let's not forget the supporting cast with the  outstanding Sissy Spacek. Other great contributions are made by  cinematographer Freddie Francis and also by the score composer.I once  wrote that Terrence Malick's &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; is not always  poetic because it strives too hard to be just that.

479490,A2HPUBAJYTJKLP,6305810109,Benjamin Denes,"[7, 8]","I know the title for this review sounds pretty underwhelming, but I want to stress how much weight the word 'good' means in this case. 1999 gave the audience a troughful of preachy feel good and pretentious message-movies, but 'Straight Story' was the only film that was 'good'. No agenda's or convulated plots, just a simple story of a man and his journey.'Straight Story' is good for so many different reasons. David Lynch is one of my favourite directors, so I am pretty biased in calling him a genius, but this film truly puts his artist's vision on full display. Though much more 'mainstream' (although how could one ever give this label to Lynch) than his other films, 'Story' contains many elements which definately mark this work as his own. Fascinatingly bizarre (yet strangely real and familiar) characters, often odd camera angles and weird dialogue all inhabit this film.Performances by the late Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek are so flawless and dead-on real that they can't even be called performances. Farnsworth is especially touching in the poignant role of Alvin Straight, and I believe will long be remembered to be his best role.Of course, what would a post-'Elephant Man' Lynch film be without the music of Angelo Badelementi? Although quite different from his past masterworks for 'Twin Peaks' and 'Lost Highway', the music he composes still remains beautiful and haunting, a great companion to the visuals Lynch creates.Some people may feel that this film was stiffed at the Oscars. Heck, I'm glad it wasn't nominated for more.

479491,A2GHT8TGD4XI0Q,6305810109,Bereft,"[2, 3]","First, let me disclose my bias that I am a HUGE David Lynch fan.  That being said, let me also say that in no way does that sway my opinion of this movie.  Yeah, right.  No, seriously, it doesn't.  Why?  Well...To begin, this is the most un-Lynchian movie D.L. has ever created.  I say that with somewhat of a ""grain of salt,"" but I think most stalwart Lynch fans will understand my meaning.  This is simply unlike ANYTHING he has ever done.  Period.  There is definitely a linear, less-is-more, mentality in this film.  It is immediately touching and kindles the very most basic humane spirit that (I would like to believe) dwells within us all.Perhaps the subject matter is the major reason why that is the case.  But simply put, this movie is wholly and completely beautiful.  Every facet of the movie just drips with beauty.  Whether it's the gorgeous sunrises or sunsets over the plains, or whether it's simply LISTENING to Richard Farnsworth (aka ""Alvin Straight"") talk as the viewer stares into a campfire...watching the flames dance around the logs thrown on top of each other.  Whether its seeing the huge amount of road that lay before Alvin Straight, or whether its listening to him haggle over prices of tractor repairs or a ""grabber.""  Every where the viewer is taken, is beautiful.What else? My God, Harry Dean Stanton.  Can I just digress for a moment and ask:  ""WHEN IS PARIS, TEXAS GOING TO BE RELEASED ON DVD?""  The agony of going with out it (save for an extremely well-worn VHS copy) is torture.  At any rate, enough of that.  My point is this, Harry Dean Stanton (in the words of David Lynch) ""rocks.""  He is an amazing actor. Pure brilliance.  Even his (roughly) two minute appearance in this movie makes it that much more complete.  As an aside once more, Harry Dean Stanton always reminds me of (the old, not young) Chet Baker (of trumpet-playing fame).  Anyone else?Which brings me to my next amazing person:  Sissy Spacek.  As always, she delivers and impeccable performance as the mildly-brain damaged daughter of Alvin Straight.  Once again Ms. Spacek, kudos.Of course, the man of the show is the late Richard Farnsworth.  Many may remember him as the sheriff in Stephen King's ""Misery.""  His performance here is just heart-stopping. He was an amazing man, who was perfectly suited for the role of Alivn Straight.Musically, as with any Lynch film, it is beautiful.  Angleo (""The Bad Angel"") is here again, delivering a more restrained, yet equally capturing, score.  There are very brief moments, that, just for a moment, you can hear remnants of Twin Peaks' material showing their presence (particularly in the very beginning of the film).There are so many images that come to mind during the course of watching this film.  You are drawn to a variety of mediums from Lynch's imagery.  For instance, the descriptions of the plains that Willa Cather used in her book ""My Antonia"" came to my mind.  Then, for some reason, Steve Earle's song ""The Road Goes On Forever"" came to mind.  The ability of a director to instill (or rather, recall) memories within the viewer's mind is something that is not achieved frequently.  Here, Lynch does it perfectly.Lastly, despite the fact that this is a G rated movie, and despite the fact that Disney is behind it, it is not a children's movie.  That is, it is not for kids.  Older kids will appreciate the message this movie delivers.  However, younger kids who just finished watching Barney or Rugrats will probably not even understand what is going on within the film.To make a long (winded) review longer, get this film as soon as you can.  The DVD (technically speaking) is beautiful and I applaud Lynch for not inserting chapter breaks.  But more importantly, the film itself is beautiful and moving and will touch you permanently.",5,Wisconsin...I hear it's a real 'party' state...,1019174400,"04 19, 2002",2002,3801,"['First', 'let', 'disclose', 'bias', 'am', 'HUGE', 'David', 'Lynch', 'fan', 'being', 'said', 'let', 'also', 'say', 'way', 'sway', 'opinion', 'movie', 'Yeah', 'right', 'No', 'seriously', ""n't"", 'Why', 'Well', 'begin', 'most', 'un-Lynchian', 'movie', 'D.L', 'ever', 'created', 'say', 'somewhat', 'grain', 'salt', 'think', 'most', 'stalwart', 'Lynch', 'fans', 'will', 'understand', 'meaning', 'simply', 'ANYTHING', 'ever', 'done', 'Period', 'definitely', 'linear', 'less-is-more', 'mentality', 'film', 'immediately', 'touching', 'very', 'most', 'basic', 'humane', 'spirit', 'would', 'like', 'believe', 'dwells', 'all.Perhaps', 'subject', 'matter', 'major', 'reason', 'why', 'case', 'simply', 'put', 'movie', 'wholly', 'completely', 'beautiful', 'facet', 'movie', 'just', 'drips', 'beauty', 'gorgeous', 'sunrises', 'sunsets', 'plains', 'simply', 'LISTENING', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'talk', 'viewer', 'campfire', 'watching', 'flames', 'dance', 'logs', 'thrown', 'top', 'other', 'seeing', 'huge', 'amount', 'road', 'lay', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'listening', 'haggle', 'prices', 'tractor', 'repairs', 'grabber', 'Every', 'where', 'viewer', 'taken', 'else', 'My', 'God', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Can', 'just', 'digress', 'moment', 'ask', 'WHEN', 'IS', 'PARIS', 'TEXAS', 'GOING', 'TO', 'BE', 'RELEASED', 'ON', 'DVD', 'agony', 'going', 'save', 'extremely', 'well-worn', 'VHS', 'copy', 'torture', 'rate', 'enough', 'point', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'words', 'David', 'Lynch', 'rocks', 'amazing', 'actor', 'Pure', 'brilliance', 'Even', 'roughly', 'two', 'minute', 'appearance', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'complete', 'aside', 'once', 'more', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'always', 'old', 'not', 'young', 'Chet', 'Baker', 'trumpet-playing', 'fame', 'Anyone', 'else', 'Which', 'next', 'amazing', 'person', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'always', 'delivers', 'impeccable', 'performance', 'mildly-brain', 'damaged', 'daughter', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'Once', 'again', 'Ms.', 'Spacek', 'kudos.Of', 'course', 'man', 'show', 'late', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'Many', 'may', 'remember', 'sheriff', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Misery', 'performance', 'here', 'just', 'heart-stopping', 'was', 'amazing', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'role', 'Alivn', 'Straight.Musically', 'Lynch', 'film', 'beautiful', 'Angleo', 'Bad', 'Angel', 'here', 'again', 'delivering', 'more', 'restrained', 'yet', 'equally', 'capturing', 'score', 'are', 'very', 'brief', 'moments', 'just', 'moment', 'can', 'hear', 'remnants', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'material', 'showing', 'presence', 'particularly', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'images', 'come', 'mind', 'course', 'watching', 'film', 'are', 'drawn', 'variety', 'mediums', 'Lynch', 'imagery', 'instance', 'descriptions', 'plains', 'Willa', 'Cather', 'used', 'book', 'Antonia', 'came', 'mind', 'Then', 'reason', 'Steve', 'Earle', 'song', 'Road', 'Goes', 'Forever', 'came', 'mind', 'ability', 'director', 'instill', 'rather', 'recall', 'memories', 'viewer', 'mind', 'something', 'not', 'achieved', 'frequently', 'Here', 'Lynch', 'perfectly.Lastly', 'fact', 'G', 'rated', 'movie', 'fact', 'Disney', 'not', 'children', 'movie', 'not', 'kids', 'Older', 'kids', 'will', 'appreciate', 'message', 'movie', 'delivers', 'However', 'younger', 'kids', 'who', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Barney', 'Rugrats', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'even', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'film.To', 'make', 'long', 'winded', 'review', 'longer', 'get', 'film', 'as', 'soon', 'can', 'DVD', 'technically', 'speaking', 'beautiful', 'applaud', 'Lynch', 'not', 'inserting', 'chapter', 'breaks', 'more', 'importantly', 'film', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'will', 'touch', 'permanently']",The Straight Story VHS

How many would attempt to pull a trailer with a riding mower across 260 miles of state highways? Not many that is for sure. Alvin Straight's own failing health has made him realize that his ten year dispute with his brother just doesn't matter any more.Alvin recalls him and his brother growing up on a farm and caring about each other. Now he must use the only thing he can to get there, a riding mower. Straight meets interesting people on his journey just like Bert Munro did in ""The World's Fastest Indian"". Sissy Spacek is excellent as Straight's handicapped daughter. The movie is an emotional ride at a pace equal to Alvin's mower, and that's a good thing. If you enjoy movies like ""The World's Fastest Indian"", ""Second Hand Lions"", and ""The Station Agent"", you will probably like this one. Disappointedly there are no extras on the DVD.

Richard Farnsworth does an absolutely fantastic job acting in this movie as Lyle Straight.  The cinematography is also notably excellent, and it is still a shock to realize that this film was directed by the ever-weird David Lynch.I did a bit of research on the real Alvin Straight, and I have a tendency to think that he was not entirely the humanistic, compassionate soul that was portrayed in the movie.  It takes a reclusive, cantankerous man with too much time on his hands to refuse to get on a Greyhound bus and instead embark on a six week journey on a tractor just to go a few hundred miles.  To the real Alvin Straight's credit, he reportedly refused to appear on David Letterman and other shows trumpeting his odyssey.  This was clearly a man who wanted to be left alone.Actually, the real star of the movie is this rural corner of the US that is the Iowa/Wisconsin border.  The peaceful scenery and hospitable people, as well as laid-back lifestyle and slower pace of life can really be appealing.  I think that the film captures that aspect very well, and it makes one want to go and visit.  The film itself was reportedly filmed along the actual route that the real Alvin Straight took on his journey.So even though this film offers us a clearly romanticized view of this event, it does so in a way that is not unrealistic, even if it is idealized.

479499,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,6305810109,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[5, 5]","""The Straight Story,"" David Lynch's quietly brilliant epic, is unlike any film I've ever seen. There are moments when you sense the path, and then it veers in new directions of dignity. Everything about this journey of an elderly man seems earnest and authentic - Richard Farnsworth's final performance, the true story on which the film is based, on-location shooting where the events took place, filming in sequence - eventually coming together as a subtle and unlikely continuation of Lynch's unique vision.That Lynch had this work in him is one of the most hopeful occurrences in film history. One of the greatest modern directors, he has challenged for decades with unconventional trademark productions, from instant cult classicsEraserheadandBlue Velvet (Special Edition), the dark period pieceThe Elephant Man, the horrifyingLost HighwayandWild at Heart. I'm sure I left out a film or TV series, but no matter. Lynch's world is often an excursion through the realms of nightmare. His body of work may not hold up against similar masters Martin Scorsese or Steven Spielberg, but this one film is superior to any they've ever made. ""Straight Story,"" yes, is rated G and yes, is a Walt Disney production, but it's the flip side of Lynch's nightmare, a gentle dream, hopeful and amazingly audacious.Film-making became art the instant someone exposed a trolley car clacking down a busy street circa 1910. It's instant art, oftentimes possessing the depth of a microwavable lunch. Today, filmmakers move fast, forging visions of animated destruction, car crashes, machine guns and men walking away from exploding buildings. These films are populated with young actors, glistening pecks, slick haircuts, shaved heads and tight clothes. They drive waxed cars with loud motors, jump from helicopters and conduct slow-motion scissor kicks against multiple adversaries.Lynch's ""Straight Story"" is the exact opposite of every convention in film today. It exclusively details the long journey of a wheezing elderly man on the back of a riding lawnmower ambling 5 mph. He moves slower than modern society, gazing at roadside fields, blankets of evening stars, rumbling thunderstorms and cyclists zooming by. He stops to smell the roses, so to say, as he encounters numerous souls, a wayward teenager who actually looks like a teenager, a comfortable middle age family kicked back in lawn chairs, an elderly bartender who serves beer cold, a lawnmower salesman (Everett McGill) who shoots straight, ""It's a good machine."" There are other souls encountered en route to the ultimate soul, an estranged brother embracing his final months of life.It's based on the true story of Alvin Straight, an old man with failing vision who traveled 200-plus miles on a lawnmower across Wisconsin and Iowa to visit an ailing brother. Richard Farnsworth was a perfect choice for the lead, an elderly actor suffering from cancer on the set (he would die soon after the film's completion). Farnsworth, one of Hollywood's most interesting individuals, had spent a life in the movies, first as an extra in such films as ""Gone with the Wind,"" later a stuntman on John Wayne westerns, evolving into the weathered, no-nonsense acting presence we came to love inComes a HorsemanandThe Grey Fox [VHS]. Nominated for an Oscar in this role, Farnsworth gives a heartbreaking performance combining physical and spiritual pain, his soul exposed in every scene (and very much akin to Wayne's final performance in the meandering, cameo-heavyThe Shootist).""The Straight Story"" is ultimately the microcosm of a man's complete life, one who has embraced anger of the past, has kicked alcoholism, who lives with the scars of years. He's had struggles, a mentally challenged daughter (Sissy Spacek), failing health, minimum income, and yet he's able to view life in a gratified manner. They say some people can see the entire world within their backyard. Lynch has documented such a man and very nearly revealed the secret of the universe. When watching ""The Straight Story,"" I'm reminded ofThe Bicycle ThiefandIkiru - Criterion Collection.

479502,AF50ULMYITS9J,6305810109,Corey Slack,"[56, 58]","With 'The Straight Story' David Lynch has weaved together a subtle, fascinating story about age, regret, and family.  The tale is of Alvin Straight, a 73 year old man who has seen most of what life has to dish out  and learns that his brother suffered a stroke.  With bad eyes and no  license, he sets out on a journey on a riding lawnmower to see his brother,  who he hasn't spoken to in ten years.What I loved most about this movie  is the simplicity; of the story, the characters, the filming.  Yet within  that classic style is a movie that is incredibly moving.  The stories that  Alvin has to tell about his life are saddening, touching, and almost  frightening.  He talks about being old, about fighting in World War II, and  about his regrets of not speaking to his brother.  He runs into quite a few  people along the way who help him out, and their stories contribute to a  beautifully crafted script.Richard Farnsworth is convincing in the  role of Alvin.  His abilities are most especially outlined in the sad tone  of his voice, and the look of regret and hope in his eyes.  It is rare that  I have grown to respect and adore a character so much.

The Straight Story is the simple tale of a 73-year-old man who travels on his riding lawnmower over 300 miles to see his estranged brother who just had a stroke.The film takes its time telling its story, giving us plenty of opportunity to study Alvin and all the characters he meets along the way to Wisconsin to see his brother Lyle (Lynch regular Harry Dean Stanton). Alvin leaves his daughter (Sissy Spacek) to take what he feels is his last opportunity to make up with Lyle. Farnsworth is the show here, though, and he never stoops to make Alvin pathetic or pitiable. His strength (some may say stubbornness, but there's no meanspiritedness about it) should be an inspiration; he has to walk with two canes so every step is a journey in itself.David Lynch surprised many people (he hasn't told a ""straight story"" since 1980's The Elephant Man) by delivering a film that does not manipulate and never sentimentalizes--and it's not weird! There is a moment near the end where true feeling is elicited (probably more so if you have a sibling, as I do not) but it is not forced. This true story is a drama of a different kind, one that Hollywood couldn't repeat if it wanted as this type of film depends on the perfect combination of story, director, and actor that rarely comes together. We should feel lucky that The Straight Story was even made and appreciate it for what it is, and for what it tells us about the potential of ourselves.",5,Slow is good,1049241600,"04 2, 2003",2003,1549,"['Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'David', 'Lynch', 'departure', 'G-rated', 'film', 'weird', 'subtext', 'Straight', 'Story', 'simple', 'tale', '73-year-old', 'man', 'who', 'riding', 'lawnmower', '300', 'miles', 'see', 'estranged', 'brother', 'who', 'just', 'had', 'stroke.The', 'film', 'time', 'telling', 'story', 'giving', 'plenty', 'opportunity', 'study', 'Alvin', 'characters', 'way', 'Wisconsin', 'see', 'brother', 'Lyle', 'Lynch', 'regular', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Alvin', 'daughter', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'take', 'what', 'last', 'opportunity', 'make', 'up', 'Lyle', 'Farnsworth', 'show', 'here', 'never', 'make', 'Alvin', 'pathetic', 'pitiable', 'strength', 'may', 'say', 'stubbornness', 'meanspiritedness', 'should', 'be', 'inspiration', 'walk', 'two', 'canes', 'so', 'step', 'journey', 'itself.David', 'Lynch', 'surprised', 'many', 'people', ""n't"", 'told', 'straight', 'story', '1980', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'delivering', 'film', 'not', 'manipulate', 'never', 'sentimentalizes', 'not', 'weird', 'moment', 'end', 'where', 'true', 'feeling', 'elicited', 'probably', 'more', 'so', 'have', 'sibling', 'do', 'not', 'not', 'forced', 'true', 'story', 'drama', 'different', 'kind', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'could', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'wanted', 'type', 'film', 'depends', 'perfect', 'combination', 'story', 'director', 'actor', 'rarely', 'together', 'should', 'feel', 'lucky', 'Straight', 'Story', 'was', 'even', 'made', 'appreciate', 'what', 'what', 'potential', 'ourselves']",The Straight Story VHS

Straight says that since he's seen everything there is to see, he is more able to separate the wheat  from the chaff and let the smaller stuff fall away. After the incredible  film year of 1999 ended, and the smaller stuff fell away, David Lynch's  masterpiece remained standing head and shoulders above most of the rest,  arguably the finest film of the year.Richard Farnsworth is Alvin  Straight, a man intent on journeying 300 miles from his home in Iowa to  visit his estranged brother in Wisconsin after the latter has a stroke.  With eyes too bad to drive, and distrusting of being driven by others, he  builds a trailer to pull behind his lawn-mower and sets off on an  incredible journey, indirectly teaching valuable lessons to the folks he  meets along the way.Lynch's direction and Freddie Francis's  cinematography are breath-taking. They linger on rolling waves of endless  wheat fields, billowing seas of storm clouds and wonder-filled starry  nights ... and most important of all, they explore the incredibly emotive  landscape of Richard Farnsworth's old face, etched with an entire life's  worth of experiences, and punctuated by a beatific smile and tender blue  eyes. Farnsworth's performance is a gem.Only the most hardened of  hearts will sit through this late odyssey in an old man's life (with echoes  of Bergman's Wild Strawberries) without being touched over and over and  over by the poetry and lyricism that Lynch brings to this jewel.

""Daniel""","[5, 8]","From ELEPHANT MAN to SAILOR AND LULA and from ERASERHEAD to TWIN PEAKS, director David Lynch has written some of the most intriguing pages of modern cinema. So I was a little puzzled after having seen THE STRAIGHT STORY, a movie David Lynch shot in the autumn of 1998 in Iowa and Wisconsin. Apart of the first travelling of the movie and an accident scene shot in a subjective manner through Alvin's eyes, the movie adopts a very classic form. Obviously, David Lynch didn't want us to be distracted from the story he chose to film.Now, is there any substance in this story of an old man deciding to visit his brother by driving an unusually slow vehicle ? Of course, yes. The theme of the redemptive trip can been found in thousand of books and naturally in most of the road movies shot since the sixties. But, in my opinion, what makes THE STRAIGHT STORY strange and truly original is Alvin's idea that if he can make it, his brother will be still alive on his arrival. The trip is not only redemptive for Alvin and his conscience, it is also magic. And I'm intimately convinced that this is the theme which has seduced David Lynch, mystic among the mystics.Sissy Spacek proves once more that she is a very talented actress in THE STRAIGHT STORY and the only reason I give only three stars to this movie is that I would have liked a little more madness in the treatment of this unusual story.Be advised that this review is about the DVD zone 2 I've bought at Amazon.fr.

This sounded like something that my wife might enjoy so I rented it mostly for her; what I didn't expect was the power house of production and acting that makes this movie an amazing and memorable experience.A review of this movie requires one pull out many terms not often used of movies today, gentle, tender, sensitive, introspective, great direction, great acting, thoughtful, and non-violent for starters. It reminded me in some respects of ""Enchanted April"" where time is given to quiet moments of beauty and calm; where the camera lingers on a gentle moment filled with the beauty of just that moment.During the movie I commented to my wife that it didn't feel like I was watching acting, I was watching life being lived before my eyes. I had the impression that this was really happening as I watched; I almost had to remind myself that I was watching actors of extraordinary ability reciting lines, playing a part, that this was not reality.Also interesting, as I think back on the movie, is it never lost that sense of relaxed reality; the pace of the movie always seemed to move naturally with no rushing through the quiet moments. Facial expressions were allowed to speak to the viewer and tell of the inner emotions at play in the character.If you rush through life without stopping to smell the flowers you will probably find this movie moves too slowly; if, on the other hand, you like to enjoy the beauty of the flowers, the beauty of a sunset, a quiet moment watching the crackling of a fire in the evening, then this movie may well please and delight you as it pleased and delighted me.To fully enjoy this movie it is helpful if one has enjoyed some years of living, younger children may not be able to relate to the subtler moments featured in the telling of this beautiful and touching story.",5,A Remarkable Story Beautifully Done!,1378252800,"09 4, 2013",2013,1958,"['had', 'read', 'very', 'short', 'synopsis', 'movie', 'said', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'used', 'riding', 'lawnmower', 'travel', '300', 'miles', 'visit', 'brother', 'sounded', 'something', 'wife', 'might', 'enjoy', 'so', 'rented', 'mostly', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'was', 'power', 'house', 'production', 'acting', 'movie', 'amazing', 'memorable', 'experience.A', 'review', 'movie', 'one', 'pull', 'many', 'terms', 'not', 'often', 'used', 'movies', 'today', 'gentle', 'tender', 'sensitive', 'introspective', 'great', 'direction', 'great', 'acting', 'thoughtful', 'non-violent', 'starters', 'reminded', 'respects', 'Enchanted', 'April', 'where', 'time', 'given', 'quiet', 'moments', 'beauty', 'calm', 'where', 'camera', 'gentle', 'moment', 'filled', 'beauty', 'just', 'moment.During', 'movie', 'commented', 'wife', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'watching', 'acting', 'was', 'watching', 'life', 'being', 'lived', 'eyes', 'had', 'impression', 'was', 'really', 'happening', 'watched', 'almost', 'had', 'remind', 'was', 'watching', 'actors', 'extraordinary', 'ability', 'reciting', 'lines', 'playing', 'part', 'was', 'not', 'reality.Also', 'interesting', 'think', 'back', 'movie', 'never', 'lost', 'sense', 'relaxed', 'reality', 'pace', 'movie', 'always', 'seemed', 'move', 'naturally', 'rushing', 'quiet', 'moments', 'Facial', 'expressions', 'were', 'allowed', 'speak', 'viewer', 'tell', 'inner', 'emotions', 'play', 'character.If', 'rush', 'life', 'stopping', 'smell', 'flowers', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'movie', 'too', 'slowly', 'other', 'hand', 'like', 'enjoy', 'beauty', 'flowers', 'beauty', 'sunset', 'quiet', 'moment', 'watching', 'crackling', 'fire', 'evening', 'then', 'movie', 'may', 'well', 'please', 'delight', 'pleased', 'delighted', 'me.To', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'helpful', 'one', 'enjoyed', 'years', 'living', 'younger', 'children', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'relate', 'subtler', 'moments', 'featured', 'telling', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'story']",The Straight Story VHS

While I think Richard Farnsworth did a beautiful acting job,  and it is certainly a breath of fresh air from some of the films that are out and about today, I was disappointed that it did &quot;grab me and take me in&quot;.  While I thought Farnsworth's acting was great, as usual; I've seen Sissy Spacek put in more effort in other films, but there were parts of this film that dragged along and there were a few scenes, when he had set up his trailer/tent in the back yard of the folks who help him when the tractor breaks down, that didn't make sense.  The scenes were filmed far away and though the actors were talking you couldn't make out what they were saying. I suppose these scenes had their purpose in the movie, but I found them annoying. Also some of the scenes ended quickly and strangely as though it was cutting to a commercial (as you would see on television--fade to black).  Overall, though, the message got through and it was an inspiring film. Richard Farnsworth deserved an award for his performance.  I just don't think there is anything in there that reaches out and embraces you. Even the several scenes that showed the country side were a little boring (rows and rows of wheat fields (?).  Even the scenes where he gazes at the stars looks unreal (too many stars) and you could tell some of them were laid over top another field of stars.  I agree with another reviewer that the musical score was not up-to-par either.

It is a surprisingly straight forward film (rated G, for goodness sakes! on a Lynch film??) and boasts some of the best landscape cinematography, in my humble opinion, since Days of Heaven or The Horse Whisperer.  It is really quite beautiful.  And Richard Farnsworth offers a superb performance as the man who decides to trek cross country to visit his brother (If you don't already know, this film was based on a true story).  Those people interested in Mr. Farnsworth's performance should definitely check out Anne of Green Gables (it is always on PBS for fund-raising and it is probably one of the best family films of the last several decades, honestly!).This film is slow and methodical and is quite a good counter-point to all the MTV-editing style action films of the day.  But you can read about the plot elsewhere, I want to say a few words about the DVD itself.  This is a STRANGE DVD, to be blunt.  I know David Lynch usually does strange things, but this is *really* strange.  The video and audio quality of the DVD are quite good - no complaints there.  But this is totally bare-bones, only a trailer and nothing else.  Nothing.  Considering the really hefty price tag this DVD has, that's nonsensical.  But the weirdest thing is that the movie is NOT divided into any chapters at all.  It's all ONE chapter.  So if you watch one hour, plug in a different DVD, and then return to this one, you'll have to fast-forward through the entire movie to get back to where you were.  Heaven forbid that you should have a power outage 5 minutes before the end of the movie.  I guess Mr. Lynch wants us to watch the entire film in one setting, but really...So, I rate the film a very HIGH 5 stars, but because of the peculiar presentation of the DVD, I must bump it down to 4 stars. Despite this, I really recommend this film - it's perfect for the family and it even teaches some valuable lessons on the virtues of unity and family.",4,What on Earth were they thinking?,1004227200,"10 28, 2001",2001,2045,"['Howdy', 'First', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'most', 'David', 'Lynch', 'films', 'think', 'one', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'surprisingly', 'straight', 'forward', 'film', 'rated', 'G', 'goodness', 'sakes', 'Lynch', 'film', 'best', 'landscape', 'cinematography', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Days', 'Heaven', 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'really', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'superb', 'performance', 'man', 'who', 'trek', 'cross', 'country', 'visit', 'brother', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'people', 'interested', 'Mr.', 'Farnsworth', 'performance', 'should', 'definitely', 'check', 'out', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'always', 'PBS', 'fund-raising', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'family', 'films', 'last', 'several', 'decades', 'honestly', '.This', 'film', 'slow', 'methodical', 'quite', 'good', 'counter-point', 'MTV-editing', 'style', 'action', 'films', 'day', 'can', 'read', 'plot', 'elsewhere', 'want', 'say', 'few', 'words', 'DVD', 'STRANGE', 'DVD', 'be', 'blunt', 'know', 'David', 'Lynch', 'usually', 'strange', 'things', '*really*', 'strange', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'DVD', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'complaints', 'there', 'totally', 'bare-bones', 'only', 'trailer', 'nothing', 'else', 'Nothing', 'Considering', 'really', 'hefty', 'price', 'tag', 'DVD', 'nonsensical', 'weirdest', 'thing', 'movie', 'NOT', 'divided', 'chapters', 'ONE', 'chapter', 'So', 'watch', 'one', 'hour', 'plug', 'different', 'DVD', 'then', 'return', 'one', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fast-forward', 'entire', 'movie', 'get', 'back', 'where', 'were', 'Heaven', 'forbid', 'should', 'have', 'power', 'outage', '5', 'minutes', 'end', 'movie', 'guess', 'Mr.', 'Lynch', 'watch', 'entire', 'film', 'one', 'setting', 'really', 'So', 'rate', 'film', 'very', 'HIGH', '5', 'stars', 'peculiar', 'presentation', 'DVD', 'must', 'bump', 'down', '4', 'stars', 'really', 'recommend', 'film', 'perfect', 'family', 'even', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'virtues', 'unity', 'family']",The Straight Story VHS

But, the film lives up to its title, a feat that Lynch familiars should be interested in.The film is a very simple (true) tale of Alvin Straight, who learns that his brother - who he hasn't spoken to in years - has had an illness fall upon him and decides to go and see him.  So, he hops on a riding lawnmower and off he goes.  This idea could have easily turned into a silly mess, but throughout, the film is handled with care and sentiment (not sentimentality).It has a measured pace, so the restless beware.  But if you have no problem with the pace of The Sweet Hereafter or Breaking The Waves, this shouldn't be a problem.  Lynch explores the rural countryside of America with conscience, it's like a love letter to his Heartland Of America roots.The plot would be pointless to specifically recount because it would just reveal incidents that happen on Alvin's journey.  For the entire film Alvin travels and meets with various people, who are each - in different ways - touched by his presence.  We also meet Alvin's daughter, who is interesting, and we learn about one or two of her problems.  We learn some of Alvin's past by his tellings with others who he meets.The score is delicate, alomost mournful, played mostly on a violin.Without trying to sound too pretentious, The Straight Story may be Lynch's most personal film.

David Lynch still has the knack for catching the weirdness of  life on film, it's just that in the Straight Story, he does it in a  non-shocking way.  The cinematography is wonderful, as you would expect  with a Lynch film and the acting is particularly strong.  These actors are  not beautiful Hollywood stars, but average looking people with lots of  talent.

479524,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6305810109,"""flickjunkie""","[2, 2]","Richard Farnsworth has been acting 63 years.  That's a long time as a supporting and character actor.  He gets his big opportunity to be a leading man at age 79 and he nails it.  Farnsworth plays Alvin Straight who  takes a cross country odyssey on a riding mower to see his ailing brother  with whom he has not spoken in ten years.This is a warm and touching  story that takes its time unfolding.  Alvin's journey is a journey for the  viewer as well. It is an excellent character study of a proud and  cantankerous old man who is determined to cling to his self sufficiency and  dignity and for whom failure is not an option.  It reminds us that behind  the eyes of those old faces that we so often push aside, there are real  people with strong principles, wisdom, experience and emotions worth far  more than the value we place on them.Director David Lynch is to be  commended for transcending his own usually bizarre mold in this film.  Though his pacing is decidedly slow, so is the lawnmower, so it is  appropriate.  The prelude to Alvin's getting on the road was particularly  deliberate and might have been condensed a bit, but once on the road the  pacing was perfectly adapted to the story.  The locations were terrific,  with numerous aerial shots of our beautiful heartland.  The story was  presented with sensitivity and simplicity without a lot of visual  gimmickry.  It's good to see a film where the story and not the filmmaking  is the point.Farnsworth gives the performance of his career.  His  portrayal makes Alvin determined and stubborn, but in a way that is lovable  and charismatic.  His ability to distill complex emotions into simple  expressions was masterful.My only real criticism was that Sissy Spacek  gave what I thought was a sub-par performance for her.  I thought she  overdid the speech impediment to the point where it hindered the  dialogue.This is an absorbing and wonderful human interest story.  I  rated it a 9/10.  For those looking for fast paced action, this is not your  movie.  For everyone else, see it soon and enjoy its simple enchantment.",5,Wonderful human interest story,958435200,"05 16, 2000",2000,2090,"['Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'been', 'acting', '63', 'years', 'long', 'time', 'supporting', 'character', 'actor', 'big', 'opportunity', 'be', 'leading', 'man', 'age', '79', 'Farnsworth', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'who', 'cross', 'country', 'odyssey', 'riding', 'mower', 'see', 'ailing', 'brother', 'whom', 'not', 'spoken', 'ten', 'years.This', 'warm', 'touching', 'story', 'time', 'unfolding', 'Alvin', 'journey', 'journey', 'viewer', 'well', 'excellent', 'character', 'study', 'proud', 'cantankerous', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'determined', 'cling', 'self', 'sufficiency', 'dignity', 'whom', 'failure', 'not', 'option', 'eyes', 'old', 'so', 'often', 'push', 'aside', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'strong', 'principles', 'wisdom', 'experience', 'emotions', 'worth', 'far', 'more', 'value', 'place', 'them.Director', 'David', 'Lynch', 'be', 'commended', 'transcending', 'own', 'usually', 'bizarre', 'mold', 'film', 'pacing', 'decidedly', 'slow', 'so', 'lawnmower', 'appropriate', 'prelude', 'Alvin', 'getting', 'road', 'was', 'particularly', 'deliberate', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'condensed', 'bit', 'once', 'road', 'pacing', 'was', 'perfectly', 'adapted', 'story', 'locations', 'were', 'terrific', 'numerous', 'aerial', 'shots', 'beautiful', 'heartland', 'story', 'was', 'presented', 'sensitivity', 'simplicity', 'lot', 'visual', 'gimmickry', 'good', 'see', 'film', 'where', 'story', 'not', 'filmmaking', 'point.Farnsworth', 'performance', 'career', 'portrayal', 'Alvin', 'determined', 'stubborn', 'way', 'lovable', 'charismatic', 'ability', 'distill', 'complex', 'emotions', 'simple', 'expressions', 'was', 'masterful.My', 'only', 'real', 'criticism', 'was', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'gave', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'sub-par', 'performance', 'thought', 'overdid', 'speech', 'impediment', 'point', 'where', 'hindered', 'dialogue.This', 'absorbing', 'wonderful', 'human', 'interest', 'story', 'rated', '9/10', 'looking', 'fast', 'paced', 'action', 'not', 'movie', 'everyone', 'else', 'see', 'soon', 'enjoy', 'simple', 'enchantment']",The Straight Story VHS
479525,A3TVS7UW8A2NXV,6305810109,Garry Messick,"[2, 2]","A lot of people have David Lynch pegged as a filmmaker obsessed with darkness, depravity, grotesquerie, perversion and weirdness for its own sake.  Not to sound too ....., but these people are immune to visual poetry and should stick with Adam Sandler or Schwarzeneggar movies.  Yes, there are some elements of all of the above in Lynch's work, but always too there is a sense of humanity, a certain skewed grace.  With The Straight Story, the spirituality that has always been present in Lynch's films comes more prominently to the fore than it ever has before (with the possible exception of The Elephant Man).  The Straight Story lacks much in the way of outright strangeness in terms of content, but the general oddness of Lynch's style, his unique sense of composition and editing rhythms, his whole way of seeing, is very much in evidence here.  Based on the true story of Alvin Straight, an old man who made a 300-mile journey by riding mower to see his estranged brother, The Straight Story is so, well, straightforward and simple that it achieves a kind of purity.  By all accounts, on a personal level Lynch is an unusually warm, sweet guy and I can believe it. This film couldn't have been made by someone who wasn't a fundamentally clear-eyed, good man, and the deep-down decency of Straight is accordingly made palpable by the deep-down decency of the director.  When Alvin finally meets up with his ailing brother, the film ends with an exchange between the two that is so understated and eloquent that it's almost startling in its power.  Eschewing any trace of cheesey sentimentality, Lynch makes a statement about the importance of love and forgiveness that even the most hardened cynic would be moved by.  If you missed this in the theater, the widescreen DVD is the only way to go.

I am not surprised.  Lynch is one of our great filmmakers, and to see him branch out with this film (and succeed magnificently) is phenomenal.  In the hands of a lesser director, this film would have been awful.  It would have been overly sentimental with a bombastic music score.  With Lynch, it becomes incredibly moving and tender.  Richard Farnsworth should have won an Oscar for his performance here.  Why he didn't is another one of those Oscar mysteries that will never be solved.  Sissy Spacek, who Lynch has known since his Eraserhead days, gives a great performance as well.  The supporting cast is excellent here, too, and the small town folk are portrayed with dignity and humanity, a far cry from Lynch's Blue Velvet, where they were portrayed as pervertted and ugly.  But then, not all small town people can be deranged, now can they?  Lynch saw all sides of them, like the true artist that he is.  This is a wonderful film.

479532,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,6305810109,Jason N. Mical,"[5, 6]","Love him or hate him, David Lynch always manages to surprise.  With ""The Straight Story,"" a G-rated family film released by Disney (surprised yet?), he gives audiences a reason to sit and ponder reality - to look up at the stars and imagine, and to look at friends and family with love.Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth, in his last movie role), a mostly-disabled farmer living with his slow-but-gentle daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek), learns that his health may be declining after both his hips give out.  His doctor tells him that unless he quits smoking and begins to eat well, he will have more serious health problems.  Then, Alvin gets a phone call from his brother, Lyle, who has suffered a stroke.  Alvin and Lyle have not spoken in years, and Alvin decides to go visit.  With bad eyesight and a daughter who cannot drive, Alvin sets off across Iowa to Wisconsin on a riding lawnmower, trailer in tow.Along the way, he meets a variety of people who help him out, and talk with him about his trip and why he's going.  As he meets different people, more of Alvin and Lyle's background is revealed, and the good nature of the main character becomes apparent.  Lynch is a master filmmaker, and in his hands this script becomes magic.  It moves along at a lawn-mower pace (pardon the pun), preferring to focus on character and dialogue than action, weaving an amazingly-accurate portrayal of middle-low-class Midwestern life.  Lynch is known for his attention to detail, and he does not disappoint: most, if not all, of the film was shot on-location and in real buildings (as opposed to soundstages), and he bucked convention and cast real-life people in real-life roles.  These aren't liposuctioned models or Hollywood pretty-boys; women have cottage cheese on their legs, men have scars and stubble, clothes are dirty, hair is greasy, and houses are dirty - in other words, it's got a sense of verisimilitude rare in any film.""The Straight Story"" is, in many ways, an anti-""Blue Velvet"" or an anti-Tragedy (in the true meaning of that word).  Like ""BV,"" it offers an unflinching view of middle-class life, but instead of the constructed, artificial town of Lumberton, ""The Straight Story"" offers something more like a documentary look at people.  Although no one in the film moralizes, and Lynch certainly doesn't use his camera to preach, what ""The Straight Story"" manages is to paint a view that, at their hearts, people are basically good.  While bad people, car chases, explosions, and Evil Warlords might make a good movie (or a profitable newscast, depending on your level of cynicism), it's refreshing to see a master present a project that reminds us that, at our core, we are all good people, and it's really not that difficult to be good to each other.As for the DVD, I think it goes without saying that watching Lynch's films in anything but widescreen is a crime, so it's good they gave us a solid, anamorphic transfer.  He doesn't like extras, so everything is bare-bones, but considering the quality of the motion picture, the price can be forgiven.Final Grade: A",5,Brilliant Film from One of the Best Living Directors,1031356800,"09 7, 2002",2002,3080,"['Love', 'hate', 'David', 'Lynch', 'always', 'surprise', 'Straight', 'Story', 'G-rated', 'family', 'film', 'released', 'Disney', 'surprised', 'yet', 'audiences', 'reason', 'sit', 'ponder', 'reality', 'look', 'up', 'stars', 'imagine', 'look', 'friends', 'family', 'love.Alvin', 'Straight', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'last', 'movie', 'role', 'mostly-disabled', 'farmer', 'living', 'slow-but-gentle', 'daughter', 'Rose', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'health', 'may', 'be', 'declining', 'hips', 'give', 'out', 'doctor', 'smoking', 'eat', 'well', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'serious', 'health', 'problems', 'Then', 'Alvin', 'phone', 'call', 'brother', 'Lyle', 'who', 'suffered', 'stroke', 'Alvin', 'Lyle', 'have', 'not', 'spoken', 'years', 'Alvin', 'go', 'visit', 'bad', 'eyesight', 'daughter', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'drive', 'Alvin', 'off', 'Iowa', 'Wisconsin', 'riding', 'lawnmower', 'trailer', 'tow.Along', 'way', 'variety', 'people', 'who', 'help', 'out', 'talk', 'trip', 'why', 'going', 'different', 'people', 'more', 'Alvin', 'Lyle', 'background', 'revealed', 'good', 'nature', 'main', 'character', 'apparent', 'Lynch', 'master', 'filmmaker', 'hands', 'script', 'magic', 'along', 'lawn-mower', 'pace', 'pun', 'preferring', 'focus', 'character', 'dialogue', 'action', 'weaving', 'amazingly-accurate', 'portrayal', 'middle-low-class', 'Midwestern', 'life', 'Lynch', 'known', 'attention', 'detail', 'not', 'disappoint', 'most', 'not', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'on-location', 'real', 'buildings', 'opposed', 'soundstages', 'bucked', 'convention', 'cast', 'real-life', 'people', 'real-life', 'roles', 'are', ""n't"", 'liposuctioned', 'models', 'Hollywood', 'pretty-boys', 'women', 'have', 'cottage', 'cheese', 'legs', 'men', 'have', 'scars', 'stubble', 'clothes', 'are', 'dirty', 'hair', 'greasy', 'houses', 'are', 'dirty', 'other', 'words', 'got', 'sense', 'verisimilitude', 'rare', 'film', 'Straight', 'Story', 'many', 'ways', 'anti-', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'anti-Tragedy', 'true', 'meaning', 'word', 'BV', 'unflinching', 'view', 'middle-class', 'life', 'instead', 'constructed', 'artificial', 'town', 'Lumberton', 'Straight', 'Story', 'something', 'more', 'documentary', 'look', 'people', 'one', 'film', 'moralizes', 'Lynch', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'use', 'camera', 'preach', 'what', 'Straight', 'Story', 'paint', 'view', 'hearts', 'people', 'are', 'basically', 'good', 'bad', 'people', 'car', 'chases', 'explosions', 'Evil', 'Warlords', 'might', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'profitable', 'newscast', 'depending', 'level', 'cynicism', 'refreshing', 'see', 'master', 'present', 'project', 'core', 'are', 'good', 'people', 'really', 'not', 'difficult', 'be', 'good', 'other.As', 'DVD', 'think', 'saying', 'watching', 'Lynch', 'films', 'anything', 'widescreen', 'crime', 'good', 'gave', 'solid', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', ""n't"", 'like', 'extras', 'everything', 'bare-bones', 'considering', 'quality', 'motion', 'picture', 'price', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven.Final', 'Grade', 'A']",The Straight Story VHS

In this case it was totally unnecessary.The only rebuttal I would make to any critics who say that this film moved to slowly is that the director was trying to create a sense of time and distance.  That of a life, relationships, regrets and revelations.  None of which happen in a moment or are necessarily singular events.  Wisdom comes with time and in small increments just as the trip (in the film) demonstrates.  So for me the story did not move slowly at all.If you need to be bombarded with the stupidity and inane activity that occurs in too many Hollywood films today then the Straight Story is definitely not for you.

Remington ""John Remington""","[7, 8]","David Lynch, one of the contemporary cinema's true magicians, converts his power to casting white magic in this quietly intoxicating ode to silent reflection and natural beauty.One of the great keys to telling a great story on film lies in not what is said and done, but often what isn't. This is admittedly what often turns me away from Lynch's other works. Here, he embraces economy and finds gentle hope in America's heartland.""The Straight Story"" is exactly what the title implies: a story about sticking to the essentials of honest linear narrative structure and leaving out anything extra. It is so promising that this film was made even at all. All too often, Film makers treat their audiences like idiots and feel that every motivation, thought and reaction must be dictated through rapid editing, snappy one-liners, super stunts and CGI effects all set to a blaring soundtrack.""The Straight Story"" is a movie about quiet truths and requires the audience to fill in the blanks. Fine case in point: in the film, Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth) listens to a woman vent about running over deer. As she screeches off in her compact car, Alvin simply stares down at the deer. Usually, the filmmaker will insist upon some quick quip that comments on the action and the character, but not here. We simply move on to see Straight cooking a piece of venison over a campfire while being stared at by a molded plastic deer lawn sculpture. The scene where Farnsworth and another aged actor whisper and bare the scars of the their wartime experiences is also another fine moment that simply happens. Lynch allows the camera to lovingly and tenderly hold on his actors' beautifully weatherbeaten faces. These are wise men who have seen much more than we could ever possibly imagine.Sissy Spacek, Richard Farnsworth and the rest of the cast give fully fleshed out and three dimensional characters. The film is quietly moving without the slightest hint of sentimental seasoning. It earns its happy ending honestly.

The director strives for compassion -- I think he mostly succeeds -- but  he still can't quite resist chuckling at some of the folks he puts in his  movie.  (For instance, Farnsworth blowing apart his first lawnmower with a  shotgun might be just a bit overdetermined.)  There isn't the full respect  and acceptance of rural America that one finds, wondrously, in Robert  Duvall's  *The Apostle*.That small unpleasantness over with, let me  praise the virtues of  *The Straight Story*.  The movie is a welcome  reminder for all of us to SLOW DOWN.  Lynch forces us to travel at Alvin  Straight's pace, which at first is funny . . . and soon provides  opportunities for some inner reflection  (entirely possible while watching  a film).  And, of course, the scenery is beautiful -- Lynch doesn't make a  pretensious point of that, he merely presents it.  The story itself is  about an old patriarch  (Richard Farnsworth)  who wishes to make amends  with his stroke-afflicted brother.  Without a proper driver's license, he  must drive the 370 or so miles on a lawnmower, with a small camper hitched  to the back.  Naturally, it's based on a true story.It's a demanding  role for Richard Farnsworth  (FAR FAR more demanding than Kevin Spacey's  larking about in  *American Beauty*), who handles it superbly.  This guy  pops up in movies every once in a while, and one is always astonished at  his dominating screen presence.  But, perhaps even more astonishing is  Sissy Spacek's lamentably brief work in this movie.  Lynch makes a HUGE  error by dropping her after 30 minutes.  Her portrayal of Alvin's daughter  is shockingly one-of-a-kind -- you'll never see anything quite like it in a  film again.  But that's what great actors do, and Spacek's one of our  best.I recommend  *The Straight Story*.  It's not a masterpiece, but it  doesn't strive for greatness, anyway.

479545,A1IOJE0W1NXOSE,6305810109,Karen Potts,"[5, 5]","In this movie an old man, Alvin Straight, hears that his brother in Wisconsin has suffered a stroke.  The brothers had had an argument 10 years ago and had not spoken since. Alvin decides that he will travel to see his brother on the only mode of transportation at his disposal, a lawnmower.  The story is of his journey, both physical and emotional, towards a reconciliation.  This is a simple, but poignant movie.  When Alvin reminisces about childhood memories we have only his words, not a visual flashback.  Along the way Alvin encounters many kind people who help him when he has the inevitable problems of a 300 plus mile trip on a lawnmower.  He refuses offers of a ride by more speedy transportation, preferring instead to make his journey alone and unaided.

479546,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,6305810109,K. Driscoll,"[8, 8]","The Straight Story is a film about an old man named Alvin Straight who hasn't talked to his brother Lyle in ten years because they said some ""unforgiving things to one another."" He finds out that his estranged brother is dying and he decides to make amends and say good-bye. He drives hundreds of miles with a giant trailer attached to a lawn mower. The story is based on facts.David Lynch is known for his cutting edge, bizarre and perplexing mysteries but when taken into account with all his other films The Straight Story (and it's unusual G-rating) should be no surprise. Lynch went from the completely off-the-wall horror Eraserhead to in my opinion one of the most touching films ever made in The Elephant Man. He is no stranger to drama and it manifests itself in varying depths in every one of his films.  It often shows up in the most surprising of places. Lynch is acclaimed and credited more after Mulholland Dr., however, in many years from now he will get many of the same accolades that guys like Stanley Kubrick do now for films like this one. Lynch is a master of his craft and among the best American Directors of our time. It sounds like a bold statement now but the years will tell. I for one will argue his films are timeless.The Straight Story unfolds at a snail's pace and plays the most straight forward formulas to the tee...I'm not saying that as a drawback but it may not be for everyone.  It is the perfect environment for Lynch to show he can direct a great drama with a narrative and some older actors like Richard Farnsworth (excellent as the likeable Alvin Straight) and briefly Harry Dean Stanton as Lyle. Sissy Spaceck is also excellent as Alvin's daughter. If I were to list the most touching sequences in film for me, two come from Lynch films. One scene being when John Merrick is well received by Dr. Treves' wife in the Elephant Man, and the other being a scene from The Straight Story. The scene starts off as a sort of comical and lighthearted part in the movie where twins work on Alvin's broken down lawnmower and they fight while they are doing it. It almost seems like Lynch is being exploitative at first here, but he makes you relate tremendously and feel for these two brothers (especially if you're a twin or have a brother close in age like me). It's so simple but Lynch really has created as likeable a character as you can get in Farnsworth's Straight. Another touching scene is when Alvin is asked by a few bikers what the worst thing is about growing old and he replies ""remembering when I was young"" with a proud smile.  Farnsworth's recent death makes this statement even harder. The comment is layered but comes off as simple like the rest of this amazing film.Mary Sweeny and John Roach deserve just as much if not more credit for writing this screenplay. I hate giving too much credit to the director but Lynch deserves to be lauded for simply taking on such a pure and uninviting project.  The films his real fans appreciate are for the most part on the other side of the spectrum. It seems risky if it were not for the fact that Lynch is pretty much famous for not giving a damn about risks. However, Lynch is the kind of filmmaker who is capable of creating the most profound kind of drama, but mostly his films are viewed as guilty of shock and not seen far beyond that. When Kubrick began creating his films I'm quite sure many people did the same thing. Lynch is a filmmaking wizard and one of these days the whole world will recognize it.",5,David Lynch can make Beautiful Movies too,1178755200,"05 10, 2007",2007,3504,"['Straight', 'Story', 'film', 'old', 'man', 'named', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'who', ""n't"", 'talked', 'brother', 'Lyle', 'ten', 'years', 'said', 'unforgiving', 'things', 'one', 'out', 'estranged', 'brother', 'dying', 'make', 'amends', 'say', 'good-bye', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'giant', 'trailer', 'attached', 'lawn', 'mower', 'story', 'based', 'facts.David', 'Lynch', 'known', 'cutting', 'edge', 'bizarre', 'perplexing', 'mysteries', 'when', 'taken', 'account', 'other', 'films', 'Straight', 'Story', 'unusual', 'G-rating', 'should', 'be', 'surprise', 'Lynch', 'went', 'completely', 'off-the-wall', 'horror', 'Eraserhead', 'opinion', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'stranger', 'drama', 'varying', 'depths', 'one', 'films', 'often', 'up', 'most', 'surprising', 'places', 'Lynch', 'acclaimed', 'credited', 'more', 'Mulholland', 'Dr.', 'however', 'many', 'years', 'now', 'will', 'get', 'many', 'same', 'accolades', 'guys', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'do', 'now', 'films', 'one', 'Lynch', 'master', 'craft', 'best', 'American', 'Directors', 'time', 'bold', 'statement', 'now', 'years', 'will', 'tell', 'one', 'will', 'argue', 'films', 'are', 'timeless.The', 'Straight', 'Story', 'unfolds', 'snail', 'pace', 'most', 'straight', 'forward', 'tee', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'drawback', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'perfect', 'environment', 'Lynch', 'show', 'can', 'direct', 'great', 'drama', 'narrative', 'older', 'actors', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'excellent', 'likeable', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'briefly', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'Lyle', 'Sissy', 'Spaceck', 'also', 'excellent', 'Alvin', 'daughter', 'were', 'list', 'most', 'touching', 'sequences', 'film', 'two', 'come', 'Lynch', 'films', 'One', 'scene', 'being', 'when', 'John', 'Merrick', 'well', 'received', 'Dr.', 'Treves', 'wife', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'other', 'being', 'scene', 'Straight', 'Story', 'scene', 'off', 'sort', 'comical', 'lighthearted', 'part', 'movie', 'where', 'work', 'Alvin', 'broken', 'down', 'lawnmower', 'fight', 'are', 'doing', 'almost', 'Lynch', 'being', 'exploitative', 'first', 'here', 'relate', 'tremendously', 'feel', 'two', 'brothers', 'especially', ""'re"", 'twin', 'have', 'brother', 'close', 'age', 'so', 'simple', 'Lynch', 'really', 'created', 'likeable', 'character', 'can', 'get', 'Farnsworth', 'Straight', 'touching', 'scene', 'when', 'Alvin', 'asked', 'few', 'bikers', 'what', 'worst', 'thing', 'growing', 'old', 'remembering', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'proud', 'smile', 'Farnsworth', 'recent', 'death', 'statement', 'even', 'harder', 'comment', 'layered', 'off', 'as', 'simple', 'rest', 'amazing', 'film.Mary', 'Sweeny', 'John', 'Roach', 'deserve', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'credit', 'writing', 'screenplay', 'hate', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'credit', 'director', 'Lynch', 'be', 'lauded', 'simply', 'taking', 'pure', 'uninviting', 'project', 'films', 'real', 'fans', 'appreciate', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'other', 'side', 'spectrum', 'risky', 'were', 'not', 'fact', 'Lynch', 'pretty', 'much', 'famous', 'not', 'giving', 'damn', 'risks', 'However', 'Lynch', 'kind', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'capable', 'creating', 'most', 'profound', 'kind', 'drama', 'mostly', 'films', 'are', 'viewed', 'guilty', 'shock', 'not', 'seen', 'far', 'When', 'Kubrick', 'began', 'creating', 'films', ""'m"", 'quite', 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'Lynch', 'filmmaking', 'wizard', 'one', 'days', 'whole', 'world', 'will', 'recognize']",The Straight Story VHS

When I heard the news, I was very excited that he was going to shoot a road movie that was nothing to do with paranormals and weird characters. After watching Straight story I was wondering  where was he before and why he was not shooting movies like this that can be called normal in his standards once a while.First of all this is a road movie. But also a movie about an old man who tries his best to achieve what he wants against all odds.It is also about humanity, respect as well as the elderly people who have seen all about life  but either extremely ignored or not remebered. Lynch manages to build a story combining all these elements and making the movie a visual and an emotional beauty.Straight story  takes us in to the heart of America with the real American people who are always there but rarely seen in the hollywood productions as normal,friendly folks.We also enter in to the world of elderly, their limited lives and their emotions.  Beautiful camera shots of fields, simple but touching music as well as the remarkable performances by the actors and actresses make this movie a classic. Even during the common road scenes it is difficult not to get very emotional. Lynch not only knows how to get chills to the spine with his previous works, but he also knows how to get in to the people's hearts by a camera.Overall in my opinion Straight story is an excellent movie which is better than the recent oscar awarded movies with their spoiled  million dollar actors and actresses as well as overblown budgets.A film for everyone and a film to remember.",5,Pure brilliance,1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,1696,"['know', 'appreciate', 'Lynch', 'twisted', 'movies', 'viewer', 'forced', 'expect', 'unexpected', 'abnormal', 'When', 'heard', 'news', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'was', 'going', 'shoot', 'road', 'movie', 'was', 'nothing', 'do', 'paranormals', 'weird', 'characters', 'watching', 'Straight', 'story', 'was', 'wondering', 'where', 'was', 'before', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'shooting', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'normal', 'standards', 'once', 'while.First', 'road', 'movie', 'also', 'movie', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'best', 'achieve', 'what', 'odds.It', 'also', 'about', 'humanity', 'respect', 'as', 'well', 'elderly', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'life', 'extremely', 'ignored', 'not', 'remebered', 'Lynch', 'build', 'story', 'combining', 'elements', 'making', 'movie', 'visual', 'emotional', 'beauty.Straight', 'story', 'heart', 'America', 'real', 'American', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'there', 'rarely', 'seen', 'hollywood', 'productions', 'normal', 'friendly', 'folks.We', 'also', 'enter', 'world', 'elderly', 'limited', 'lives', 'emotions', 'Beautiful', 'camera', 'shots', 'fields', 'simple', 'touching', 'music', 'as', 'well', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'actors', 'actresses', 'make', 'movie', 'classic', 'Even', 'common', 'road', 'scenes', 'difficult', 'not', 'get', 'very', 'emotional', 'Lynch', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'get', 'chills', 'spine', 'previous', 'works', 'also', 'how', 'get', 'people', 'hearts', 'camera.Overall', 'opinion', 'Straight', 'story', 'excellent', 'movie', 'better', 'recent', 'oscar', 'awarded', 'movies', 'spoiled', 'million', 'dollar', 'actors', 'actresses', 'as', 'well', 'overblown', 'budgets.A', 'film', 'everyone', 'film', 'remember']",The Straight Story VHS

Indeed this movie lacks the sex and violence and sarcasm that dominates today's Gen Xer's video library. But does that make it a film intended strictly for the geriatric crowd?  Heck no!!  It's one of THE best movies I've ever seen. Perhaps it's because I grew up in a small Illinois town, pop. 550.  Perhaps it's because Alvin Straight reminded me so much of my own dad puttering around on his tractor.  Perhaps it's because it was so realistic and sweet...whatever the reason, this movie touched me down to the core.I love films based on real-life.  Sissy Spacek is cute and believable as Rose.  Her stuttering and simplistic portrayal made me feel Rose's pain.  And Mr. Farnsworth's interpretation of Alvin is stunning.  He is a simple man, there's no doubt about it.  Anyone who would jump on a tractor and drive himself hundreds of miles without investing in a bus ticket or thinking to go to the local church to ask for a ride is someone who clearly doesn't accept charity.  He probably never considered himself needy.  This was his last goal in life, to mend fences between he and his brother.Who didn't grab a hanky at the last scene when they finally reconcile in their quiet, simple way?  Too many words pass between people today.  If everyone was an Alvin Straight, we'd be doing a lot more thinking and a lot less yammering away.I could rave on and on about this movie, maybe because I'm a country girl at heart.  It's a family movie, although young kids will probably get bored.  It's not fast-paced, and if you're looking for a climax, you're probably not going to get it.

The story behind this movie is touching and it drives the viewer to want to see the movie through.The problem is with the film itself.  The story is good, it's heartwarming, it provokes reflection... but the film is not and does not.The acting in this film is embarrassing to watch at times.  The cheesiness of some of the dialogue is over-the-top.  The direction... I hate to say it, but it looks like a movie made for television, and for a Saturday afternoon at that.  The characters are mostly hollow (the deer-lady reminded me of the log-lady from earlier David Lynch work).I started watching this movie and it had enough potential to make me follow it through, but at every turn it just got worse.Now, I'm not the type that is going to dismiss a movie because something doesn't blow up every 45 seconds... it's fine that this movie has a slow, deliberate pace.  However, what it lacks is meaningful character interation, irony, conflict, tension - anything to raise the interest level.  The closest thing we get to emotion is regret, and regret is hardly a plot-driver.  The two most interesting characters of the film are separated early on and rarely interact after that.  The rest of the character interaction is basically limited to saying nice things to each other followed by ""good luck"" ""thanks for the help"" ""amen to that"" ""nice to meat you"" kind of dialogue.There are some good scenes in the movie and the story behind it is compelling, so I give it two stars.",2,Great story does not equal great plot or great movie,1143072000,"03 23, 2006",2006,1664,"['realize', ""'m"", 'taking', 'chance', 'writing', 'review', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'are', 'minority', 'get', 'lots', ""'unhelpful"", 'review', 'marks.However', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'story', 'movie', 'touching', 'viewer', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'through.The', 'problem', 'film', 'story', 'good', 'heartwarming', 'reflection', 'film', 'not', 'not.The', 'acting', 'film', 'embarrassing', 'watch', 'times', 'cheesiness', 'dialogue', 'over-the-top', 'direction', 'hate', 'say', 'movie', 'made', 'television', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'hollow', 'deer-lady', 'reminded', 'log-lady', 'earlier', 'David', 'Lynch', 'work', '.I', 'started', 'watching', 'movie', 'had', 'enough', 'potential', 'make', 'follow', 'turn', 'just', 'got', 'worse.Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'type', 'going', 'dismiss', 'movie', 'something', ""n't"", 'blow', 'up', '45', 'seconds', 'fine', 'movie', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'pace', 'However', 'what', 'meaningful', 'character', 'interation', 'irony', 'conflict', 'tension', 'anything', 'raise', 'interest', 'level', 'closest', 'thing', 'get', 'emotion', 'regret', 'regret', 'hardly', 'plot-driver', 'two', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'separated', 'early', 'rarely', 'interact', 'rest', 'character', 'interaction', 'basically', 'limited', 'saying', 'nice', 'things', 'other', 'followed', 'good', 'luck', 'thanks', 'help', 'amen', 'nice', 'meat', 'kind', 'dialogue.There', 'are', 'good', 'scenes', 'movie', 'story', 'compelling', 'give', 'two', 'stars']",The Straight Story VHS

You see, as soon as I heard it was directed by David Lynch, I didn't want to watch it. All of those bad undergraduate memories of gothed-out, late-night ""Blue Velvet"" movie get-togethers, having to hear people babble endlessly on about ""Twin Peaks"" in the early 90's, and high school ""Eraserhead"" days all combined throughout time to make me hate David Lynch. Then I heard ""The Straight Story"" was about some guy on a lawn mower. I thought it was going to be pointlessly weird and annoying.I was wrong, thank goodness! This was a hypnotic film that really touches your heart. I never cry when I watch a movie, but this one got the waterworks flowing (I'm embarassed to say). There was nothing weird or pointlessly strange about it (I'm glad!). The musical score was wonderful, and the performances luminous. The storyline is highly creative, while still being a believable slice-of-life at the same time.In an odd way, this film reminded me of ""Slingblade"". Pretty much, if you liked ""Slingblade"", you'll like this movie.

479561,A3O6T4GH0J1F9Y,6305810109,"Michael LaPointe ""Island Mike""","[3, 3]","In 1999, one of the most unusual pairings in Hollywood history formed to make a film telling the story of Alvin Straight's odyssey: David Lynch and Walt Disney Pictures. Lynch, arguably one of film's more daring storytellers, the mind behind Eraserhead, Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, is absolutely the very last filmmaker I would ever have believed to team with Disney, except perhaps David Cronenberg. His films often navigate the darkest waters of the human experience with an unflinching eye for images both disturbing and nightmarish, and so naturally the idea that he'd done a film for Disney, a G-rated film at that, I could scarcely believe it. And I absolutely had to see for myself what could come of this most unexpected collaboration.The Straight Story opens with Alvin Straight (played to perfection by the late Richard Farnsworth, an actor and former stuntman whose career dated back to the 1930's), who lives in Iowa and has just learned that his estranged brother Lyle, who lives in Wisconsin, has suffered a stroke. Alvin decides that it's time to put their feud behind them and wants to visit his brother and make peace while there's still time. The problem is that Alvin no longer has a driver's license because of his failing eyesight, and his pride is too strong to allow someone to drive him or take a bus. So Alvin attaches a small trailer to his John Deere riding mower and sets off on an epic journey.As with most road movies, much of the story is told through Alvin's encounters with people he meets along the course of his travels. Upon meeting a hitchhiking young runaway (who has a big secret she's scared to disclose to her parents), Alvin offers these words, remembering a lesson he would often give to children:""I'd give each one of 'em a stick, one for each one of 'em, then I'd say, 'You break that.' Course they could real easy. Then I'd say, 'Tie them sticks in a bundle and try to break that.' Course they couldn't. Then I'd say, 'That bundle... that's family.'""As the story progresses, it is through these seemingly random encounters that we learn more of Alvin's story, and how he came to be the man who is determined to complete this journey. Alvin Straight appears on the surface to be a fairly simple man, but just beneath the surface lies a different person: a man who has made mistakes and while he accepts responsibility for them, he is still haunted by the things he has done and seen over the course of a lifetime. Little by little, we are allowed to see the person inside and in doing so, we learn perhaps a little about ourselves as well. Alvin is a proud man, and yet he is the first to admit that his pride has cost him dearly over the years. He is not a perfect person, and it is clear that he struggles daily with his demons.It is rare that a filmmaker has the confidence with actors and the trust in the audience to allow moments of quiet; moments in which the story, the emotions, and the story are told only by the actors, and yet this film is largely comprised of soft, quiet scenes that propel the story far better than any soundtrack or flashy camera tricks ever could. As Alvin grows ever closer to his destination, his encounters with strangers become more complex and in the process we learn of the heartbreak and devastation he has endured over the course of his life. In a way, Alvin's journey is one of redemption, and not only in regard to mending fences with his brother. In one incredible scene, Alvin recounts his experiences of a war many years past and I dare anyone who sees it to not shed a tear for the innocence that was brutally torn from him and the impact those nightmares still have upon him.The film itself is paradoxical; on one hand, it is a simple film with a simple story and a small cast. On the other hand, however, it is an emotionally rich and complex film that, despite the G-rating, never panders to the audience, instead trusting that Alvin's odyssey is largely a voyage of the soul and that the truths to his humanity are so universal that there is simply no need to explain them.In a time when so-called ""family"" films rely too heavily on weak stories supplanted by excessive effects work and toilet humor, The Straight Story stands high above all others, offering a story of quiet dignity, the power of perseverance, and in the hands of a truly amazing cast, it works flawlessly. And in the end we learn, as is often the case, that it is the journey and not the destination in which the greater truths are often found.",5,My Favorite Film,1218240000,"08 9, 2008",2008,4509,"['1999', 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'pairings', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'formed', 'make', 'film', 'telling', 'story', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'odyssey', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Pictures', 'Lynch', 'arguably', 'one', 'film', 'more', 'daring', 'storytellers', 'mind', 'Eraserhead', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'absolutely', 'very', 'last', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'believed', 'team', 'Disney', 'perhaps', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'films', 'often', 'navigate', 'darkest', 'waters', 'human', 'experience', 'unflinching', 'eye', 'images', 'disturbing', 'nightmarish', 'so', 'naturally', 'idea', ""'d"", 'done', 'film', 'Disney', 'G-rated', 'film', 'could', 'scarcely', 'believe', 'absolutely', 'had', 'see', 'what', 'could', 'come', 'most', 'unexpected', 'collaboration.The', 'Straight', 'Story', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'played', 'perfection', 'late', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'actor', 'former', 'stuntman', 'career', 'dated', 'back', '1930', 'who', 'Iowa', 'just', 'learned', 'estranged', 'brother', 'Lyle', 'who', 'Wisconsin', 'suffered', 'stroke', 'Alvin', 'time', 'put', 'feud', 'visit', 'brother', 'make', 'peace', 'still', 'time', 'problem', 'Alvin', 'no', 'longer', 'driver', 'license', 'failing', 'eyesight', 'pride', 'too', 'strong', 'allow', 'someone', 'drive', 'take', 'bus', 'So', 'Alvin', 'attaches', 'small', 'trailer', 'John', 'Deere', 'riding', 'mower', 'sets', 'off', 'epic', 'journey.As', 'most', 'road', 'movies', 'much', 'story', 'told', 'Alvin', 'encounters', 'people', 'course', 'travels', 'meeting', 'hitchhiking', 'young', 'runaway', 'who', 'big', 'secret', 'scared', 'disclose', 'parents', 'Alvin', 'words', 'remembering', 'lesson', 'would', 'often', 'give', 'children', ""'d"", 'give', 'one', 'stick', 'one', 'one', 'then', ""'d"", 'say', ""'You"", 'break', 'Course', 'could', 'real', 'easy', 'Then', ""'d"", 'say', ""'Tie"", 'sticks', 'bundle', 'try', 'break', 'Course', 'could', ""n't"", 'Then', ""'d"", 'say', ""'That"", 'bundle', 'family', 'story', 'seemingly', 'random', 'encounters', 'learn', 'more', 'Alvin', 'story', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'man', 'who', 'determined', 'complete', 'journey', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'surface', 'be', 'fairly', 'simple', 'man', 'just', 'surface', 'different', 'person', 'man', 'who', 'made', 'mistakes', 'responsibility', 'still', 'haunted', 'things', 'done', 'seen', 'course', 'lifetime', 'Little', 'little', 'are', 'allowed', 'see', 'person', 'inside', 'doing', 'so', 'learn', 'perhaps', 'little', 'about', 'as', 'well', 'Alvin', 'proud', 'man', 'yet', 'first', 'admit', 'pride', 'cost', 'dearly', 'years', 'not', 'perfect', 'person', 'clear', 'daily', 'demons.It', 'rare', 'filmmaker', 'confidence', 'actors', 'trust', 'audience', 'allow', 'moments', 'quiet', 'moments', 'story', 'emotions', 'story', 'are', 'told', 'only', 'actors', 'yet', 'film', 'largely', 'comprised', 'soft', 'quiet', 'scenes', 'propel', 'story', 'far', 'better', 'soundtrack', 'flashy', 'camera', 'tricks', 'ever', 'could', 'Alvin', 'ever', 'closer', 'destination', 'encounters', 'strangers', 'become', 'more', 'complex', 'process', 'learn', 'heartbreak', 'devastation', 'endured', 'course', 'life', 'way', 'Alvin', 'journey', 'one', 'redemption', 'not', 'only', 'regard', 'mending', 'fences', 'brother', 'one', 'incredible', 'scene', 'Alvin', 'experiences', 'war', 'many', 'years', 'dare', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'shed', 'tear', 'innocence', 'was', 'brutally', 'torn', 'impact', 'nightmares', 'still', 'have', 'him.The', 'film', 'paradoxical', 'one', 'hand', 'simple', 'film', 'simple', 'story', 'small', 'cast', 'other', 'hand', 'however', 'emotionally', 'rich', 'complex', 'film', 'G-rating', 'never', 'panders', 'audience', 'instead', 'trusting', 'Alvin', 'odyssey', 'largely', 'voyage', 'soul', 'truths', 'humanity', 'are', 'so', 'universal', 'simply', 'need', 'explain', 'them.In', 'time', 'when', 'so-called', 'family', 'films', 'rely', 'too', 'heavily', 'weak', 'stories', 'supplanted', 'excessive', 'effects', 'work', 'toilet', 'humor', 'Straight', 'Story', 'high', 'others', 'offering', 'story', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'power', 'perseverance', 'hands', 'truly', 'amazing', 'cast', 'flawlessly', 'end', 'learn', 'often', 'case', 'journey', 'not', 'destination', 'greater', 'truths', 'are', 'often', 'found']",The Straight Story VHS

Alvin sets out to visit his estanged brother over 300 miles away on a lawnmower - the only vehicle he can drive - taking him over a month to cover the distance.I suppose he wanted to get there his own way, and perhaps to show his brother just how much making up meant to him.  It would be very easy to hop on a bus and make an effort, but that wouldn't exactly require 100% commitment, would it?  Alvin is obviously out to prove something, to his brother, to himself, and to the world.Along the way he meets various people.  He helps some, is helped by others, and simply reminisces with yet more.  As he goes along, you get to know him as a gentle, kind old man, with watery eyes and a penchant for wieners.  Richard Farnsworth does a great job in this role, and is very convincing.  Sissy Spacek is also good , she plays a slightly retarded and troubled daughter.You can tell that this is a true story from the way Alvin's quest to visit his brother has a false start.  That kind of thing only happens in real life, if this was a script, a writer would have smoothed that kink out right from the start.Lynch, the Director, does a good job in portraying the vast expanse of the distance that Alvin has to cover, but I thought he could have done better at giving an indication of how long the journey took.  There were lots of shots of Alvin chugging along, but you didn't know if they were all in the same day or week or month or what - thus the dropped star.Overall, this is a very nice film, one for a cold night in, relaxing by the fire.",4,"A quiet, pensive, thoughtful film.",970444800,"10 2, 2000",2000,1665,"['film', 'was', 'really', 'family', 'what', 'should', 'mean', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'willing', 'do', 'get', 'back', 'Alvin', 'out', 'visit', 'estanged', 'brother', '300', 'miles', 'away', 'lawnmower', 'only', 'vehicle', 'can', 'drive', 'taking', 'month', 'cover', 'distance.I', 'suppose', 'wanted', 'get', 'own', 'way', 'perhaps', 'show', 'brother', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'making', 'up', 'meant', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'easy', 'hop', 'bus', 'make', 'effort', 'would', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'require', '100', '%', 'commitment', 'would', 'Alvin', 'obviously', 'prove', 'something', 'brother', 'world.Along', 'way', 'various', 'people', 'helped', 'others', 'simply', 'reminisces', 'yet', 'more', 'along', 'get', 'know', 'gentle', 'kind', 'old', 'man', 'watery', 'eyes', 'penchant', 'wieners', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'great', 'job', 'role', 'very', 'convincing', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'also', 'good', 'slightly', 'retarded', 'troubled', 'daughter.You', 'can', 'tell', 'true', 'story', 'way', 'Alvin', 'quest', 'visit', 'brother', 'false', 'start', 'kind', 'thing', 'only', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'script', 'writer', 'would', 'have', 'smoothed', 'kink', 'out', 'right', 'start.Lynch', 'Director', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'vast', 'expanse', 'distance', 'Alvin', 'cover', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'giving', 'indication', 'how', 'long', 'journey', 'took', 'were', 'lots', 'shots', 'Alvin', 'chugging', 'along', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'same', 'day', 'week', 'month', 'what', 'thus', 'dropped', 'star.Overall', 'very', 'nice', 'film', 'one', 'cold', 'night', 'relaxing', 'fire']",The Straight Story VHS
479563,A1FG91CM8221X1,6305810109,Miles D. Moore,"[4, 5]","""The Straight Story"" has the gorgeously colored, semi-surreal look of a typical David Lynch movie, but here the surrealism is lyrical and benign. There are no armies of insects fighting to the death underneath the amber wheatfields, no severed ears in the pristine woods. The overweight next-door neighbor, sunning herself while eating pastel-colored Hostess snowballs, may look weird, but she's perfectly nice. As the title implies, this is the ""straight"" and deceptively simple story based on the true tale of Alvin Straight, an elderly Iowa man who, hearing that his long-estranged brother has had a stroke, wants to go to Wisconsin and mend fences with him. Too incapacitated himself to drive a car, he hitches a trailer to his riding lawn mower and spends five weeks driving the 300 miles along country roads to his brother's house. That's all there is to it, but it's incredibly moving, thanks to Freddie Francis' gorgeous photography of the Midwest countryside and Lynch's poetic direction. Above all, what makes this movie worth seeing is the exquisite, deeply moving performance of Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight. Silent for long stretches of the film, Farnsworth tells the story of Straight's life mainly through his eyes, showing a world of stubborn decency and bitter regret. When Farnsworth does speak--such as his monologue in a bar about his World War II experiences as a sniper--you will never forget it. There is only one recent screen performance that is at all like Farnsworth's--Adrien Brody's in ""The Pianist."" There is also Sissy Spacek's performance as Straight's mentally challenged daughter Rose; although Spacek's performance seems overly mannered at first, she keeps revealing telling details about Rose until, at the end, her performance is as haunting as Farnsworth's own. ""The Straight Story"" may have the look and slightly off-kilter feel of a David Lynch movie, but at heart it resembles another recent Disney-released movie, ""The Rookie,"" which also is deeply concerned with the love of family and the need for second chances in life. Both movies are beautifully realized, but ""The Straight Story"" is an authentic American masterpiece.",5,"The kinder, gentler David Lynch movie.",1048982400,"03 30, 2003",2003,2174,"['Straight', 'Story', 'gorgeously', 'colored', 'semi-surreal', 'look', 'typical', 'David', 'Lynch', 'movie', 'here', 'surrealism', 'lyrical', 'benign', 'are', 'armies', 'insects', 'fighting', 'death', 'amber', 'wheatfields', 'severed', 'ears', 'pristine', 'woods', 'overweight', 'next-door', 'neighbor', 'sunning', 'eating', 'pastel-colored', 'Hostess', 'snowballs', 'may', 'look', 'weird', 'perfectly', 'nice', 'title', 'implies', 'straight', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'story', 'based', 'true', 'tale', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'elderly', 'Iowa', 'man', 'who', 'hearing', 'long-estranged', 'brother', 'had', 'stroke', 'go', 'Wisconsin', 'mend', 'fences', 'Too', 'incapacitated', 'drive', 'car', 'trailer', 'riding', 'lawn', 'mower', 'five', 'weeks', 'driving', '300', 'miles', 'along', 'country', 'roads', 'brother', 'house', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'thanks', 'Freddie', 'Francis', 'gorgeous', 'photography', 'Midwest', 'countryside', 'Lynch', 'poetic', 'direction', 'what', 'movie', 'seeing', 'exquisite', 'deeply', 'moving', 'performance', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'Silent', 'long', 'stretches', 'film', 'Farnsworth', 'story', 'Straight', 'life', 'mainly', 'eyes', 'showing', 'world', 'stubborn', 'decency', 'bitter', 'regret', 'When', 'Farnsworth', 'speak', 'such', 'monologue', 'bar', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'sniper', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'only', 'one', 'recent', 'screen', 'performance', 'Farnsworth', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Pianist', 'also', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'performance', 'Straight', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'daughter', 'Rose', 'Spacek', 'performance', 'overly', 'mannered', 'first', 'revealing', 'telling', 'details', 'Rose', 'end', 'performance', 'as', 'haunting', 'Farnsworth', 'own', 'Straight', 'Story', 'may', 'have', 'look', 'slightly', 'off-kilter', 'feel', 'David', 'Lynch', 'movie', 'heart', 'recent', 'Disney-released', 'movie', 'Rookie', 'also', 'deeply', 'concerned', 'love', 'family', 'need', 'second', 'chances', 'life', 'movies', 'are', 'beautifully', 'realized', 'Straight', 'Story', 'authentic', 'American', 'masterpiece']",The Straight Story VHS
479564,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,6305810109,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","Released in 1999 to high critical praise, this movie didn't do well, coming short of its miniscule $10 million budget.  Still, I remembered it for some reason I got it recently.  Richard Farnsworth gives a remarkable performance in the true story of Alvin Straight and his mission to visit his estranged but seriously ill older brother.  Farnsworth was 79 at the time and had to play the 73 year old Straight.  Straight himself wasn't well.  He had bad hips, needing canes to walk.  His failing eyesight prohibited driving, so he decides to make the 300 mile trip across Iowa on his riding lawn mower.I know it sounds pretty farfetched and given the fact this was directed by David Lynch, one would assume he would meet up with aliens or something.  But Lynch holds back.  Even when Straight meets an assortment of Midwesterners, they all seem very real.  Along his weeks long sojourn, he must deal with his own devils and memories.  In one scene, Straight and an equally old man trade war stories in a small town bar.  Their memories of WWII are as fresh as yesterday and still weigh on them 50 some years later.  Straight reveals a secret he had never shared, one that he must deal with every day.I love this movie.  It moves slowly, like the lawnmower.  It moves deliberately like Alvin Straight.  It moved me.  Farnsworth delivers the writers lines brilliantly and while Straight wasn't an educated man, he has many words of wisdom.

Pomeroy,"[6, 7]","'High concept' is a term usually used to describe blockbuster films with plots that can be summarised in one line, preferably five words long. 'Old man drives lawnmower to meet striken brother' sums up 'The Straight Story', but doesn't really do it justice. Basically a long meditation on growing old, it's a slow-moving road movie that nonetheless remains riveting from start to finish, like a cross between 'Koyaanisqatsi' and 'Wild at Heart'. It's also the only film in which Harry Dean Stanton looks relatively young. Richard Farnsworth's performance in the lead role is excellent and understated, although it's hard to separate the character from Farnsworth (who was suffering from terminal cancer, and who took his own life shortly after the film was released) himself. Faults? Lynch keeps his surrealistic instincts in check most of the time, but they burst out in a pointless scene with a woman who keeps crashing her car into deer. And a later scene, in which Farnsworth walks into a bar and has a beer and some emotional catharsis, seems a bit abrupt and contrived. But that's just being mean. This a great film, one well worth seeing, with a superb soundtrack from Angelo Badalamenti. It harkens back to a short period in the very early-70s when Hollywood produced low-budget, small-scale gems, and gives you faith in cinema again. If there is a cinematic opposite of 'New Jack City', this is it. As for the DVD, you just get a trailer and subtitles, and it's in proper widescreen. The dark bits - and there are quite a few dark bits, as the film takes place partly at night - are sometimes a bit jagged and blocky, but the picture and sound are otherwise fine.",5,Adreno-crazed speed frenzy,989280000,"05 8, 2001",2001,1672,"[""'High"", 'concept', 'term', 'usually', 'used', 'describe', 'blockbuster', 'films', 'plots', 'can', 'be', 'summarised', 'one', 'line', 'preferably', 'five', 'words', 'long', 'man', 'lawnmower', 'meet', 'striken', 'brother', 'sums', ""'The"", 'Straight', 'Story', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'justice', 'Basically', 'long', 'meditation', 'growing', 'old', 'slow-moving', 'road', 'movie', 'nonetheless', 'riveting', 'start', 'finish', 'cross', ""'Koyaanisqatsi"", 'Heart', 'also', 'only', 'film', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'relatively', 'young', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'performance', 'lead', 'role', 'excellent', 'understated', 'hard', 'separate', 'character', 'Farnsworth', 'who', 'was', 'suffering', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'who', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'shortly', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Faults', 'Lynch', 'surrealistic', 'instincts', 'check', 'most', 'time', 'burst', 'out', 'pointless', 'scene', 'woman', 'who', 'crashing', 'car', 'deer', 'later', 'scene', 'Farnsworth', 'bar', 'beer', 'emotional', 'catharsis', 'bit', 'abrupt', 'contrived', 'just', 'being', 'mean', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'superb', 'soundtrack', 'Angelo', 'Badalamenti', 'back', 'short', 'period', 'very', 'early-70s', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'produced', 'low-budget', 'small-scale', 'gems', 'faith', 'cinema', 'again', 'cinematic', 'opposite', ""'New"", 'Jack', 'City', 'DVD', 'just', 'get', 'trailer', 'subtitles', 'proper', 'widescreen', 'dark', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'dark', 'bits', 'film', 'place', 'partly', 'night', 'are', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'jagged', 'blocky', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'otherwise', 'fine']",The Straight Story VHS
479566,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6305810109,Mr. Cairene,"[15, 16]","Apart from simply implying that the film is the story of Alvin Straight, the title, ""The Straight Story"" is also a colloquial reference to Lynch's crystal clear vision. That, appropriately is where all irony ends. The Straight Story is not a film of metaphors or symbols, although the journey of a stubborn man across 370 miles to see his ailing brother, his encounter with a wide variety of folk has been construed as some sort of fable. Lynch, always one to expose the rot the lies beneath the picket fences, has a filmography that would encourage such an interpretation. The story here, from all angles is that of a man and his mower, and ofcourse everything in his long life that has led to this momentous journey.Richard Farnsworth was nominated for best actor in a leading role, and lost. Perhaps that was appropriate. There is a certain falsehood in the word ""performance"". He wears the sorrow and the joy of some 70 odd years on his face. Unlike many movies about or featuring elders, the film doesn't presume him to be some ubiquitous fountain of wisdom. He is honest, and whatever wisdom he has was hard earned. The worst thing about being old he tells a somewhat hyper cyclist he meets on the road is ""remembering when you were young"". Maybe a better accolade for Farnsworth is people's inability to describe how he is in the film. An expression, that seems to emulate from whatever soul human beings have, is worn on his face. It says, and affects, more then is feasible to describe.There was I recall surprise at the kindness of this film. Not just to Straight, but to the strangers he meets on the journey. They are, surprisingly for Lynch, not only sane, but ones I would be glad to run into if I just happened to be travelling on lawnmower. Lynch's fans would recognize that, although seemingly the opposite of the likes of Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart, The Straight Story comes from the same place, the same wordless search for the truth, whether in ugliness, beauty or kindness. In one scene that will be remembered for a very long time: Straight sits with a stranger. They discuss drinking, and from there, the war. There is no music, just brief sounds of battle, but no visuals. Both men experience an unexpected outpour that can only come adventitiously. He remembers those young boys back in the field ""I dream of their faces. Sometimes, it's not even my buddies, sometimes its German boys. We were shooting moon-face boys at the end of the war. Every year I live is a year more then they've had"". Quietly, this scene dwarfs Spielberg's entire Saving Private Ryan, and Lynch.... I was going to say does it, but rather, he lets it happen with the melancholy in an old man's eyes.Search if you must but you won't find another film quite like this one. The closest I can think of is Wim Wender's Paris, Texas, another seemingly unaffected film. The elements of The Straight Story are indeed superlative. Angelo Badalementi's score, particularly the twangy violin, soft acoustic guitar of Laurens Walking, is cleansing, mournful, understated. Freddie Francis's photography is breathtaking, but somehow, never overpowers the film. I would call it a masterpiece. But what Lynch and his collaborators have accomplished is a form of cinematic purity that transcends such pedestrian praise. It gains an added measure of poignancy when you consider that Farnsworth took his own life last year in the face of terminal cancer. In the film, a stranger offers to give him a ride to his brother's place. He smiles, thankful and says ""I am gonna finish this one my own way"". I could never tell exactly why, but his final gaze up at the stars is one of the great moments in cinema.",5,One Man&#65533;s Journey to the End of the Road,978825600,"01 7, 2001",2001,3687,"['Apart', 'simply', 'implying', 'film', 'story', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'title', 'Straight', 'Story', 'also', 'colloquial', 'reference', 'Lynch', 'crystal', 'clear', 'vision', 'appropriately', 'where', 'irony', 'Straight', 'Story', 'not', 'film', 'metaphors', 'symbols', 'journey', 'stubborn', 'man', '370', 'miles', 'see', 'ailing', 'brother', 'encounter', 'wide', 'variety', 'folk', 'been', 'construed', 'sort', 'fable', 'Lynch', 'always', 'one', 'expose', 'rot', 'lies', 'picket', 'fences', 'filmography', 'would', 'encourage', 'such', 'interpretation', 'story', 'here', 'angles', 'man', 'mower', 'ofcourse', 'everything', 'long', 'life', 'led', 'momentous', 'journey.Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'was', 'nominated', 'best', 'actor', 'leading', 'role', 'lost', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'appropriate', 'certain', 'falsehood', 'word', 'performance', 'sorrow', 'joy', '70', 'odd', 'years', 'face', 'many', 'movies', 'featuring', 'elders', 'film', ""n't"", 'presume', 'be', 'ubiquitous', 'fountain', 'wisdom', 'honest', 'wisdom', 'was', 'hard', 'earned', 'worst', 'thing', 'being', 'old', 'somewhat', 'hyper', 'cyclist', 'road', 'remembering', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'Maybe', 'better', 'accolade', 'Farnsworth', 'people', 'inability', 'describe', 'how', 'film', 'expression', 'emulate', 'soul', 'human', 'beings', 'have', 'worn', 'face', 'affects', 'more', 'then', 'feasible', 'describe.There', 'was', 'recall', 'surprise', 'kindness', 'film', 'Not', 'just', 'Straight', 'strangers', 'journey', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'Lynch', 'not', 'only', 'sane', 'ones', 'would', 'be', 'glad', 'run', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'travelling', 'lawnmower', 'Lynch', 'fans', 'would', 'recognize', 'seemingly', 'opposite', 'likes', 'Blue', 'Velvet', 'Wild', 'Heart', 'Straight', 'Story', 'same', 'place', 'same', 'wordless', 'search', 'truth', 'ugliness', 'beauty', 'kindness', 'one', 'scene', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Straight', 'sits', 'stranger', 'discuss', 'drinking', 'there', 'war', 'music', 'just', 'brief', 'sounds', 'battle', 'visuals', 'men', 'experience', 'unexpected', 'outpour', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'adventitiously', 'young', 'boys', 'back', 'field', 'dream', 'Sometimes', 'not', 'even', 'buddies', 'sometimes', 'German', 'boys', 'were', 'shooting', 'moon-face', 'boys', 'end', 'war', 'year', 'live', 'year', 'more', 'then', ""'ve"", 'had', 'Quietly', 'scene', 'Spielberg', 'entire', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'Lynch', 'was', 'going', 'say', 'rather', 'happen', 'melancholy', 'old', 'man', 'eyes.Search', 'must', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'film', 'quite', 'one', 'closest', 'can', 'think', 'Wim', 'Wender', 'Paris', 'Texas', 'seemingly', 'unaffected', 'film', 'elements', 'Straight', 'Story', 'are', 'indeed', 'superlative', 'Angelo', 'Badalementi', 'score', 'particularly', 'twangy', 'violin', 'soft', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'Laurens', 'Walking', 'cleansing', 'mournful', 'understated', 'Freddie', 'Francis', 'photography', 'breathtaking', 'somehow', 'never', 'film', 'would', 'call', 'masterpiece', 'what', 'Lynch', 'collaborators', 'have', 'accomplished', 'form', 'cinematic', 'purity', 'such', 'pedestrian', 'praise', 'gains', 'added', 'measure', 'poignancy', 'when', 'consider', 'Farnsworth', 'took', 'own', 'life', 'last', 'year', 'face', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'film', 'stranger', 'give', 'ride', 'brother', 'place', 'thankful', 'am', 'gon', 'finish', 'one', 'own', 'way', 'could', 'never', 'tell', 'exactly', 'why', 'final', 'gaze', 'up', 'stars', 'one', 'great', 'moments', 'cinema']",The Straight Story VHS

Especially if directed by David Lynch. But he pulls it off, and then some. This is one of the most coherent, positive films I've seen in a long while from anyone - it's even more remarkable that David Lynch directed it, hard on the heels of his celebratedly unfathomable &quot;Lost Highway&quot;.For all its difference in outlook, like Wild At Heart and Lost Highway it's an unshamed road movie. Rather than carrying the story, though, here the road (literally and figuratively) IS the story: sweeping shots of the road, the headlight view, turning wheels, highways of corn, rivers of rain down the window and even the the dead straight path of the sun in the late afternoon sky reinforce this idea of an inevitable, pre-ordained journey, which Alvin (the old buzzard on the lawnmower) personifies.With a beautifully framed sense of fatalism, Lynch takes the ostensibly absurd and makes complete sense out of it: tripping from Iowa to Wisconsin on a lawnmower isn't, you might think, the most commonsense thing to do, but in the context it's the right thing to do; it's the inevitable thing to do - and if you analyse it, it's no more pointless than a lifetime spent smoking and contracting emphysema, or for that matter not speaking to your own brother for ten years - both of which Alvin (and half the rest of us) are guilty of anyway.The characterisations of the supporting cast are incredibly humane and real - in place of Lynch's usual cast of misfits and weirdoes, Alvin encounters a succession of decent, Middle American folk, who do decent things, whilst giving Alvin the intermittent opportunity to share some hoary old pearls of wisdom, and confront one of two of the demons in his past. This aspect could have easily devolved into sordid sentimentality, but Lynch handles it very deftly indeed. The same could have been true of the final scene, but (without giving away too much), it is done with a beautiful lightness of touch, and it left me with that all-too-rare sense of complete satisfaction as the credits rolled.

479572,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,6305810109,Only-A-Child,"[6, 7]","If you are considering buying/renting/watching ""The Straight Story"", you should know that people are not lying when they tell you that it is nothing but an old guy (played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to make a 300+ mile trip on his small riding lawnmower. He meets a lot of nice ordinary people, he dispenses a little sage advice, he reflects a little on his life, and nothing much happens to him. It is closely based on a real event that was newsworthy not because of what happened to Alvin Straight on his journey, but because of the human-interest angle of a guy making a journey in such a unique way.David Lynch does a nice job of directing this Disney production, but do not expect a lot of wild expressionistic developments.A lot of people really like this film and a lot of other people are asking, ""why do people like this movie so much""? And they are the polite ones. Less polite ones are branding the film ""manipulative"" which seems like a strange criticism for a film. Aren't they supposed to be manipulative? Don't people watch films to be manipulated? If you insist on viewing ""The Straight Story"" and if you generally know what you are getting into, you should enjoy it. If you are looking for its deeper meanings I suggest that you watch it along with Monte Hellman's ""Two Lane Blacktop"". Both are road pictures and Alvin Straight's orientation as a young man was probably not much different than the driver (James Taylor) in that film. The difference is the stage of life in which the journey is being taken. Both have an intended destination. But for the driver in ""Two Lane Blacktop"" it is just a excuse to keep on the move, the highway stretches out endlessly before him and life is a journey not a destination. For Straight it is a single-minded trip that he views as his last chance to mend fences with his brother who has just had a serious stroke. It is very likely the last trip he will ever make but he does not savor the journey, he does not take satisfaction in overcoming obstacles, or even find much pleasure in his positive encounters with strangers. For him the destination is all important.This was Farnsworth's last picture, in declining health he committed suicide by gunshot a few months after the film's release. One can't help but speculate on whether he was aware during filming that ""The Straight Story"" would be the final act in his long career, and how much of that realization was incorporated into his performance.Straight's journey is a lot like that of Ned Merrill (Burt Lancaster) in ""The Swimmer"". Merrill got it into his head that he could restore things to how they were in his idyllic past if he could just swim home one afternoon through the backyards of his wealthy Connecticut suburb, using his neighbors' pools. Straight is not that delusional but he has come to believe that his brother will remain alive and be waiting for him as long as he stubbornly sticks to his original idea of traveling by mower.His other motivation for insisting on this means of travel (he won't take a bus and he turns down a ride for the last 60 miles) is to demonstrate how sincerely he wants to reconcile. If you give someone a horse it will be a lot more impressive if it is your only horse and it means that now you will have to walk. To walk is part of the gift.Then again, what do I know?

479573,A3QVAKVRAH657N,6305810109,"Orrin C. Judd ""brothersjudddotcom""","[5, 7]","This is not just the true story of very determined man named Alvin Straight, it is also a truly straightforward story, an unusual thing in modern moviesand a real surprise coming from David Lynch.  With his own mortality staring him in the face, Alvin Straight, 73 years old, decides to go visit theonce beloved brother, Lyle, from whom he has been estranged for ten years, their quarrel a product of sibling rivalry as old as the Bible and thebaleful influence of liquor.  What might have been a simple enough five hour car ride becomes an epic journey when he decides to travel the 300miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin on a riding lawnmower :I've got to go see Lyle, and I've got to make the trip on my own.Along the way he meets a young runaway girl; a woman who plows into a deer in front of him, apparently a near daily occurrence for her; a couplewho allow him to spend a few days with them after he fries a motor on a steep downhill grade; a fellow WWII vet tending bar; and finally a pastor inwhose cemetery he stops overnight.  Over the course of the six week sojourn he slowly reveals himself and his regrets for his part in the feud that hasseparated him from his brother.  As he tells the pastor:I want to sit with him and look up at the stars, like we used to, so long ago.When finally he gets to Lyle's place, his penance done, the two do indeed sit in comfortable silence on the front porch, as the stars come upoverhead.  It's the kind of speechless togetherness that only people who truly love one another are capable of maintaining and enjoying.This is entirely Richard Farnsworth's film, a role he richly deserved after a lifetime in the movies.  He began in Hollywood as a teenager in 1937,doubled for Roy Rogers and Gary Cooper, drove a chariot in The Ten Commandments, worked as a stuntman, a role player, and only veryoccasionally the lead.  Farnsworth was one of the few truly conservative people left in Hollywood and maybe the only one in recent memory whosometimes turned down films that failed to meet his own ethical standards--as regards profanity, sex, and violence.  Somehow--and I've no ideahow--that integrity was etched into his face.In the underrated movie The Big Kahuna there's a scene early on where a young man tells Danny DeVito that a secretary said he'd be easilyrecognizable because his face has character.  Later on there are scenes where DeVito is almost preternaturally calm and the only forward momentumof the story is supplied by that character-filled face.  Farnsworth had such a face too and that's an exceedingly rare quality in any human being, butespecially an actor, particularly in a day and age when special effects, plastic surgery, and bad scripts have made it easy to cast pleasant looking idiotsin most movie roles.  Recall the scene in Sunset Boulevard when Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) says : ""We had faces then"".  In that silent erafaces were required because they had to communicate.  Today, when the films don't even bother trying to communicate anything, who cares if thefaces say anything?  Well, when you see what a real face, like Farnsworth's, can convey, you'll realize what we're missing.Fittingly, this was Richard Farnsworth's last role.  Like Alvin Straight he went out on his own terms; stricken with a painful terminal cancer, he shot himself on October 6, 2000.GRADE : A",5,the character of a character actor,1019433600,"04 22, 2002",2002,3365,"['not', 'just', 'true', 'story', 'very', 'determined', 'man', 'named', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'also', 'truly', 'straightforward', 'story', 'unusual', 'thing', 'modern', 'moviesand', 'real', 'surprise', 'coming', 'David', 'Lynch', 'own', 'mortality', 'staring', 'face', 'Alvin', 'Straight', '73', 'years', 'old', 'go', 'visit', 'theonce', 'beloved', 'brother', 'Lyle', 'whom', 'been', 'estranged', 'ten', 'years', 'quarrel', 'product', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'as', 'old', 'Bible', 'thebaleful', 'influence', 'liquor', 'What', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'simple', 'enough', 'five', 'hour', 'car', 'ride', 'epic', 'journey', 'when', 'travel', '300miles', 'Laurens', 'Iowa', 'Mt', 'Zion', 'Wisconsin', 'riding', 'lawnmower', ""'ve"", 'got', 'go', 'see', 'Lyle', ""'ve"", 'got', 'make', 'trip', 'way', 'young', 'runaway', 'girl', 'woman', 'who', 'deer', 'front', 'apparently', 'near', 'daily', 'occurrence', 'couplewho', 'allow', 'spend', 'few', 'days', 'motor', 'steep', 'downhill', 'grade', 'fellow', 'WWII', 'vet', 'tending', 'bar', 'finally', 'pastor', 'inwhose', 'cemetery', 'overnight', 'course', 'six', 'week', 'sojourn', 'slowly', 'regrets', 'part', 'feud', 'hasseparated', 'brother', 'pastor', 'want', 'sit', 'look', 'up', 'stars', 'used', 'so', 'long', 'ago.When', 'finally', 'Lyle', 'place', 'penance', 'done', 'two', 'do', 'indeed', 'sit', 'comfortable', 'silence', 'front', 'porch', 'stars', 'come', 'upoverhead', 'kind', 'speechless', 'togetherness', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'love', 'one', 'are', 'capable', 'maintaining', 'enjoying.This', 'entirely', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'film', 'role', 'deserved', 'lifetime', 'movies', 'began', 'Hollywood', 'teenager', '1937', 'doubled', 'Roy', 'Rogers', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'drove', 'chariot', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'worked', 'stuntman', 'role', 'player', 'only', 'veryoccasionally', 'lead', 'Farnsworth', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'truly', 'conservative', 'people', 'left', 'Hollywood', 'maybe', 'only', 'one', 'recent', 'memory', 'whosometimes', 'turned', 'down', 'films', 'failed', 'meet', 'own', 'ethical', 'standards', 'regards', 'profanity', 'sex', 'violence', 'Somehow', ""'ve"", 'ideahow', 'integrity', 'was', 'etched', 'face.In', 'underrated', 'movie', 'Big', 'Kahuna', 'scene', 'early', 'where', 'young', 'man', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'secretary', 'said', ""'d"", 'be', 'easilyrecognizable', 'face', 'character', 'Later', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'DeVito', 'almost', 'preternaturally', 'calm', 'only', 'forward', 'momentumof', 'story', 'supplied', 'character-filled', 'face', 'Farnsworth', 'had', 'face', 'too', 'exceedingly', 'rare', 'quality', 'human', 'being', 'butespecially', 'actor', 'particularly', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'special', 'effects', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'bad', 'scripts', 'have', 'made', 'easy', 'cast', 'pleasant', 'looking', 'idiotsin', 'most', 'movie', 'roles', 'Recall', 'scene', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'when', 'Norma', 'Desmond', 'Gloria', 'Swanson', 'had', 'then', 'silent', 'erafaces', 'were', 'required', 'had', 'communicate', 'Today', 'when', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'trying', 'communicate', 'anything', 'who', 'thefaces', 'say', 'anything', 'Well', 'when', 'see', 'what', 'real', 'face', 'Farnsworth', 'can', 'convey', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing.Fittingly', 'was', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'last', 'role', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'went', 'out', 'own', 'terms', 'stricken', 'painful', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'shot', 'October', '6', '2000.GRADE', 'A']",The Straight Story VHS

479575,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,6305810109,Phillip Oliver,"[5, 5]","""The Straight Story"" is a true story about a 73 year old man who drove 300 miles on a riding lawnmower to visit his estranged brother who has just had a stroke. Why did he ride a lawnmower? Well, as he tells almost everyone who asks in the movie, his eyesight is bad and he doesn't' have a drivers license. Alvin Straight is opinionated, pigheaded and cantankerous - he is not a particularly intelligent man but when he speaks, his carefully chosen words speak volumes about life. He meets many people along his five-week journey and along the way, he ruminates about mistakes he made in his life, human nature as well as the wisdom and downfalls of old age. Above all, he dispenses common sense, especially to those in need of it.Like Alvin's character, this is a simple film, brilliantly filmed by director David Lynch, but one that will stick with you long after the final credits. Richard Farnsworth received a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Actor (he committed suicide one year later after being diagnosed with terminal cancer). Sissy Spacek is, as always, wonderful as Alvin's daughter, a semi-retarded woman who herself lives in the shadow of a devastating secret. But all of the actors in this film are great, even the ones who only have brief scenes. The cinematography is wonderful as well with the camera sweeping across the prairies and plains of the Mid-West.It may come as a surprise that this film was made by David Lynch, the director who has made such unconventional films as ""Blue Velvet,"" ""Naked Lunch,"" and the tv series ""Twin Peaks.""

479578,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305810109,Reviewer,"[106, 109]","It's a journey of the soul as a man goes home in his heart, in this  dramatization of the true story of Alvin Straight, who drove a lawn mower  over three-hundred miles through the state of Iowa and into Wisconsin, to  see his brother, a stroke victim with whom he had not spoken for ten years.  ""The Straight Story,"" directed by David Lynch, recounts the story of Alvin  (Richard Farnsworth), who set out to see his brother, Lyle (Harry Dean  Stanton), upon hearing of his stroke.  Alvin is prevented from driving  because of poor eyesight, and he won't take a bus because he doesn't trust  another's driving.  A widower who lives with his daughter, Rose (Sissy  Spacek), Alvin, not a man of means, resorts to the only way he knows how,  to get to Lyle.  He needs to put the bad blood behind them before it's too  late; an estrangement born of ""anger and pride.""  Hauling a make-shift  trailer, and with three five-gallon cans of gas and a cooler full of hot  dogs, Alvin sets out, alone and determined, on his lawn mower.  Now in the  twilight of his life, having learned to ""separate the wheat from the  chaff,"" the trip affords Alvin plenty of time to reflect on his life, and  steels him in his quest to do what he feels he has to do. Along the way he  befriends and is befriended by the strangers he encounters; a testimony to  the bountifulness of the human spirit.  When a young man asks him what the  worst thing is about being old, he replies, ""Remembering when you were  young.""  Richard Farnsworth gives the performance of a lifetime as  Alvin, this stubborn, prideful man, who has learned humility with age, and  you can see the wisdom of his years in his eyes.  Farnsworth connects with  the audience from the beginning, aptly conveying the yearning of a soul in  need of atonement, and the determination of the man to effect his amends.  Sissy Spacek, also, gives a terrifically nuanced performance as Rose, the  ""slow"" daughter who lives daily with demons of her own.  That the members  of the Academy failed to nominate her for best-supporting actress for her  work here is nothing short of criminal; her Rose is a beautiful piece of  work.  David Lynch, as well, has done a remarkable job of bringing Alvin's  story to the screen.  He has woven a rich visual and emotional tapestry,  all poignantly delivered with a gentle hand.  Beautifully photographed, the  lush vistas of the Midwest reflect Alvin's state of mind, underscoring the  deeper meanings of what is really a spiritual journey, during which the  past mingles with the present.  Lynch has taken a wistful, almost poetic  approach throughout, which, together with the story is reminiscent of  Ingmar Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries.""  The scene in which Alvin finally  meets up with Lyle is perfectly and touchingly executed, and is one of the  most memorable scenes in the movie.  The supporting cast includes  James Cada (Danny), Everett McGill (Tom), Barbara E. Robertson (Deer  Woman), John Farley (Thorvald), and Kevin P. Farley (Harold).  With an  artistic hand, Lynch has crafted an unforgettable film.  ""The Straight  Story"" is Alvin's story, but the journey belongs to us; a reminder of what  is really important in life, and the needs we all share at one time or  another.  It's an entertaining movie that will touch you and make you  think, as well; and as far as I'm concerned, that's about as good as it  gets.",4,A Study Of The Human Spirit,962668800,"07 4, 2000",2000,3400,"['journey', 'soul', 'man', 'home', 'heart', 'dramatization', 'true', 'story', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'who', 'drove', 'lawn', 'mower', 'three-hundred', 'miles', 'state', 'Iowa', 'Wisconsin', 'see', 'brother', 'stroke', 'victim', 'whom', 'had', 'not', 'spoken', 'ten', 'years', 'Straight', 'Story', 'directed', 'David', 'Lynch', 'story', 'Alvin', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'who', 'set', 'out', 'see', 'brother', 'Lyle', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'hearing', 'stroke', 'Alvin', 'prevented', 'driving', 'poor', 'eyesight', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'bus', ""n't"", 'trust', 'driving', 'widower', 'who', 'daughter', 'Rose', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'Alvin', 'not', 'man', 'means', 'resorts', 'only', 'way', 'how', 'get', 'Lyle', 'put', 'bad', 'blood', 'too', 'late', 'estrangement', 'born', 'anger', 'pride', 'Hauling', 'make-shift', 'trailer', 'three', 'five-gallon', 'cans', 'gas', 'cooler', 'full', 'hot', 'dogs', 'Alvin', 'out', 'alone', 'determined', 'lawn', 'mower', 'Now', 'twilight', 'life', 'having', 'learned', 'separate', 'wheat', 'chaff', 'trip', 'affords', 'Alvin', 'plenty', 'time', 'reflect', 'life', 'steels', 'quest', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'way', 'befriended', 'strangers', 'testimony', 'bountifulness', 'human', 'spirit', 'When', 'young', 'man', 'what', 'worst', 'thing', 'being', 'old', 'Remembering', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'performance', 'lifetime', 'Alvin', 'stubborn', 'prideful', 'man', 'who', 'learned', 'humility', 'age', 'can', 'see', 'wisdom', 'years', 'eyes', 'Farnsworth', 'audience', 'beginning', 'aptly', 'conveying', 'yearning', 'soul', 'need', 'atonement', 'determination', 'man', 'effect', 'amends', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'also', 'terrifically', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Rose', 'slow', 'daughter', 'who', 'daily', 'demons', 'own', 'members', 'Academy', 'failed', 'nominate', 'best-supporting', 'actress', 'work', 'here', 'nothing', 'short', 'criminal', 'Rose', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'work', 'David', 'Lynch', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'remarkable', 'job', 'bringing', 'Alvin', 'story', 'screen', 'woven', 'rich', 'visual', 'emotional', 'tapestry', 'poignantly', 'delivered', 'gentle', 'hand', 'Beautifully', 'photographed', 'lush', 'vistas', 'Midwest', 'reflect', 'Alvin', 'state', 'mind', 'underscoring', 'deeper', 'meanings', 'what', 'really', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'past', 'mingles', 'present', 'Lynch', 'taken', 'wistful', 'almost', 'poetic', 'approach', 'together', 'story', 'reminiscent', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', 'scene', 'Alvin', 'finally', 'up', 'Lyle', 'perfectly', 'touchingly', 'executed', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'movie', 'supporting', 'cast', 'James', 'Cada', 'Danny', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'Tom', 'Barbara', 'E.', 'Robertson', 'Deer', 'Woman', 'John', 'Farley', 'Thorvald', 'Kevin', 'P.', 'Farley', 'Harold', 'artistic', 'hand', 'Lynch', 'crafted', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'Straight', 'Story', 'Alvin', 'story', 'journey', 'reminder', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'life', 'needs', 'share', 'one', 'time', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'will', 'touch', 'make', 'think', 'well', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'as', 'good']",The Straight Story VHS

I kept thinking - &quot;Good grief man, get in a  car!&quot; The slow pace was almost uncomfortable to watch, but then it  really hit me - he's not going too slow - everyone else is just moving too  fast.And indeed we are.And at first I pondered the question - why  is this good and decent old man having to endure this long trip? His  motives are pure and right. Why wasn't there an easier path for him?But  as the movie progressed, I saw that the long trip brought him many  blessings. And his presence brought a blessing to everyone he met. His own  pain over a broken relationship with his brother enabled him to help others  find healing in their own lives.Maybe the trip wasn't as much for Alvin  as it was for the people he met and helped along the way.What a  wonderful afterthought to ponder! Who received the greater  benefit!Mother Theresa once said that maybe we can't do a great big  wonderful thing, but we can all do many little wonderful things. (my  paraphrase)This movie emphasized that lovely truth. At first glance,  this old man looked like a pretty unimportant character on the stage of  life, but in terms of the wonderful things he did for others, his life was  of immeasurable worth.This movie is too good to rent. I'm buying copies  for me and as many family members as possible.What a treasure.

Late veteran actor, Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight lives with his daughter Rosie Straight (Sissy Spacek). Alvin, wise in his years, decides to make the journey on a John Deere lawn mower. Traveling miles across the rural countrysides from Iowa to Wisconsin, to settle his differences with his brother Lyle who is seriously ill. Along the way he meets people who understand his wisdom and help him along in his journey to find his brother.

Alvin knows that before he dies he want to let his brother know they're still brothers. In Alvin's words,....tie them sticks in a bundle and try to break that' Course they couldn't.

479588,AROBLPGK3SR5P,6305810109,S. Loftin,"[1, 1]","My wife and I had seen this movie back when it first came out, and then forgot about it.  Then one day I was looking on Amazon for DVDs to purchase and found ""The Straight Story"" and remembered how I had enjoyed it before.  Through the wonders of Amazon Prime, it showed up on my porch a couple of days later.The story is a fairly simple one; an elderly man, Alvin Straight, played by Richard Farnsworth, learns that his brother in Wisconsin has fallen ill, and decides to visit him.  But he has a problem - due to his own health problems he no longer has a drivers license.  So he hooks a home built trailer onto his riding mower and sets off to visit his brother.  The movie is the story of his journey.There are several thing that I like about this movie.  First it is based on a true story, and is set in Iowa.  The entire movie is shot along the actual locations that the real Alvin Straight took.  The photography is beautiful, the locales are beautiful, and it tugs at the heartstrings of this boy of the middle of the USA.Second, there is no sex or violence.  I realized after watching the movie how conditioned I have come when watching modern movies to expect something violent or sexual to happen at some point.  Some one get killed, someone has an affair - you know what I mean.  In the back of my mind I kept expecting something to happen, but it never does.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't a boring movie.  And Alvin has some close scrapes along the way, but it was so refreshing to not have the movie cheapened by inserting something violent or sexual into it.Third are the characters.  I have always liked Richard Farnsworth in the movies, and here he does a wonderful job.  Sissy Spacek, who plays his daughter, does a wonderful job as the woman with the speech impediment, taking care of her father while pining for the children she has lost.  The people he meets along the way are great also.  I don't know if they are professional actors, or extras from Iowa, but the do a great job of playing the small town, decent, salt of the earth people Alvin meets on his journey.Finally, and most importantly, I like the message of the movie.  It is a story about reconciliation.  Reconciliation primarily between Alvin and his brother, who had a falling out a decade earlier over something that no longer matters.  But reconciliation is a continuing theme throughout the movie - Alvin reconciling himself to the reality of his failing health and steadily shortening life time.  Sissy Spacek reconciling herself with her dad's journey that she disapproves of and her loss of her children.  The reconciliation of the runaway pregnant teenager Alvin meets along the way with her family that she imagines hates her for becoming pregnant.  The reconciliation of the bickering twin brothers who repair his lawn tractor when it breaks down along the way.  And the reconciliation of Alvin and a fellow World War Two veteran he meets to the horror they experienced many years ago that still haunts their memories.This isn't a flashy action movie, no special effect, no frenetic action.  But it is a story that grownups (I won't use the term adults as that has a whole different connotation) will watch and enjoy.

And it has been since early this month since I last got up a review, so I think it is time for a movie review, I enjoyed pretty much a lot of the movie, all expect for the ending of the movie, which I think could have been better, and I hate to spoil the ending of a movie, and there might be still some people out there, that haven't seen a movie yet, and I would hate to see it spoiled for them, so I do not do it, and it would be a good idea that nobody does, otherwise, they might be angry if it was spoiled for them. So if you want to see what happens in the end, and just why I was disappointed in it, you will just have to watch the movie for yourself, and I bet that a lot of parents will like to know that this in one of the very rarely movies even for familes that is a G rated movies, and they doesn't include most of thier animated movies, even through the MPAA should have slapped it with a PG rating for fantasty violence which they all pretty much have in some form.

Yet that's nothing compared to the departure cult director David Lynch made in making this film. This film is not a head trip like Mulholland Drive. It's actually the most straightforward film made in a long time. Does it work? Well . . . not really. The Straight Story is the story of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth), a simple man from a small sleepy town who discovers that his brother is dying. Straight resolves himself to see his brother one last time but he has a problem - his vision is so bad he can no longer drive. He, therefore, comes up with a novel solution - he will make the 300 mile trek on a tractor-style lawn mower. This literal journey is accompanied by another journey Straight makes into his past as he recalls memories joyful (stargazing with his brother) and painful (an unfortunate incident while serving in the army). Farnsworth gives a sweet and sincere performance but aside from that, the film is long and dull. The characters Straight meets along the way are great representations of real-life people. However, that's the problem. Real people can be unfortunately uninteresting at times and this film proves that point. None of the characters Straight encounters can provide a spark to the film. There's a momentary jolt of energy when Straight meets a woman who is distraught over hitting &quot;another&quot; deer on a country road but that sequence is over in a flash. The final reunion with Straight's brother is also strangely unfulfilling. In fact, unfulfilling is the one word that perfectly describes this film as a whole.",2,&quot;That bundle . . . that's family.&quot;,1043712000,"01 28, 2003",2003,1630,"['Seeing', 'quot', 'G', 'quot', 'rated', 'movie', 'day', 'age', 'unusual', 'nothing', 'compared', 'departure', 'cult', 'director', 'David', 'Lynch', 'made', 'making', 'film', 'film', 'not', 'head', 'trip', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'actually', 'most', 'straightforward', 'film', 'made', 'long', 'time', 'work', 'Well', 'not', 'really', 'Straight', 'Story', 'story', 'Alvin', 'Straight', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'simple', 'man', 'small', 'sleepy', 'town', 'who', 'brother', 'dying', 'Straight', 'see', 'brother', 'one', 'last', 'time', 'problem', 'vision', 'so', 'bad', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'drive', 'therefore', 'up', 'novel', 'solution', 'will', 'make', '300', 'mile', 'trek', 'tractor-style', 'lawn', 'mower', 'literal', 'journey', 'accompanied', 'journey', 'Straight', 'past', 'memories', 'joyful', 'stargazing', 'brother', 'painful', 'unfortunate', 'incident', 'serving', 'army', 'Farnsworth', 'sweet', 'sincere', 'performance', 'aside', 'film', 'long', 'dull', 'characters', 'Straight', 'meets', 'way', 'are', 'great', 'representations', 'real-life', 'people', 'However', 'problem', 'Real', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'unfortunately', 'uninteresting', 'times', 'film', 'point', 'None', 'characters', 'Straight', 'encounters', 'can', 'provide', 'spark', 'film', 'momentary', 'jolt', 'energy', 'when', 'Straight', 'woman', 'who', 'distraught', 'hitting', 'quot', 'quot', 'deer', 'country', 'road', 'sequence', 'over', 'flash', 'final', 'reunion', 'Straight', 'brother', 'also', 'strangely', 'unfulfilling', 'fact', 'unfulfilling', 'one', 'word', 'perfectly', 'film', 'whole']",The Straight Story VHS

Not very like his past efforts, yet his hand is evident.Lynch has always been fascinated with texture, long drawn out closeups of normal surfaces, and there is that (the corn fields, the highway).  There are (mildly) quirky characters and incidents (the deer lady; the repairman brothers -- one with an unusual bandage, of sorts, on his chin).  There are otherwise normal characters carrying dark secrets (the vets discussing World War 2).And while Lynch has always been fascinated with the dark secrets beneath Middle America, he's also long evinced a genuine love for Middle America.  His tales tend to be about innocents who are attracted and drawn into darkness, yet they are at the same time genuinely innocent.  And Lynch has never mocked them for their innocence, just as he does not mock them for their quirks.The Straight Story emphasizes this softer side of Lynch -- his love of Middle American innocence -- but that's always been an element of his work, albeit under-emphasized in Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet.Likewise, Lynch's longtime music collaborator, Angelo Badalamenti, creates a score that's also softer yet typical of Badelamenti's work.The Straight Story is masterpiece that stands on its own, but it remains a Lynchian masterpiece.",5,Another side of David Lynch,1024531200,"06 20, 2002",2002,1369,"['Many', 'below', 'reviews', 'explain', 'why', 'film', 'excellent', 'wanted', 'add', 'not', 'atypical', 'Lynch', 'film', 'Not', 'very', 'past', 'efforts', 'yet', 'hand', 'evident.Lynch', 'always', 'been', 'fascinated', 'texture', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'closeups', 'normal', 'surfaces', 'corn', 'fields', 'highway', 'are', 'mildly', 'quirky', 'characters', 'incidents', 'deer', 'lady', 'repairman', 'brothers', 'one', 'unusual', 'bandage', 'sorts', 'chin', 'are', 'otherwise', 'normal', 'characters', 'carrying', 'dark', 'secrets', 'vets', 'discussing', 'World', 'War', '2', '.And', 'Lynch', 'always', 'been', 'fascinated', 'dark', 'secrets', 'beneath', 'Middle', 'America', 'also', 'long', 'evinced', 'genuine', 'love', 'Middle', 'America', 'tales', 'tend', 'be', 'innocents', 'who', 'are', 'attracted', 'drawn', 'darkness', 'yet', 'are', 'same', 'time', 'genuinely', 'innocent', 'Lynch', 'never', 'mocked', 'innocence', 'just', 'not', 'mock', 'quirks.The', 'Straight', 'Story', 'softer', 'side', 'Lynch', 'love', 'Middle', 'American', 'innocence', 'always', 'been', 'element', 'work', 'under-emphasized', 'Twin', 'Peaks', 'Blue', 'Velvet.Likewise', 'Lynch', 'longtime', 'music', 'collaborator', 'Angelo', 'Badalamenti', 'score', 'also', 'softer', 'yet', 'typical', 'Badelamenti', 'work.The', 'Straight', 'Story', 'masterpiece', 'own', 'Lynchian', 'masterpiece']",The Straight Story VHS

With single-mindedness Alvin strikes upon riding his lawn mower from Western Iowa to his brother's home in Wisconsin.

His is a solitary quest and after a false start Alvin sets off on his journey.

Lynch seemed to be striving to outdo David Cronenberg in his fascination with sickos and his attention to the bizarre just around the corner from the everyday. He has managed, with 'A Straight Story,' to finally make The Great American Movie.",5,David Lynch's Destined Masterpiece,973468800,"11 6, 2000",2000,566,"['A', 'Straight', 'Story', 'David', 'Lynch', 'redeemed', 'forever', 'matter', 'what', 'thought', 'said', 'previous', 'probably', 'subsequent', 'work', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'Straight', 'Story', 'so', 'pristine', 'so', 'miraculously', 'genuine', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'work', 'man', 'who', 'brought', ""'Blue"", 'Velvet', 'Lynch', 'seemed', 'be', 'striving', 'outdo', 'David', 'Cronenberg', 'fascination', 'sickos', 'attention', 'bizarre', 'just', 'corner', 'everyday', 'managed', 'A', 'Straight', 'Story', 'finally', 'make', 'Great', 'American', 'Movie']",The Straight Story VHS

I like how this film is quirky and beautiful at the same time, thanks to David Lynch.  David Lynch is one my favourite directors and I love his sense of timing and creativity.  I enjoy watching the painted scenery of The Staight Story.  It's a good film to gel out to and trip out while the tractor rolls by.  It's a surreal experience. I enjoy temporarily checking out and escaping this big bad cruel world and The Staight Story allows me to do just that.",5,John Deere Tractor,1302739200,"04 14, 2011",2011,562,"['become', 'one', 'time', 'favourite', 'movies', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'are', 'fantastic', 'like', 'how', 'film', 'quirky', 'beautiful', 'same', 'time', 'thanks', 'David', 'Lynch', 'David', 'Lynch', 'one', 'favourite', 'directors', 'love', 'sense', 'timing', 'creativity', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'painted', 'scenery', 'Staight', 'Story', 'good', 'film', 'gel', 'out', 'trip', 'out', 'tractor', 'rolls', 'surreal', 'experience', 'enjoy', 'temporarily', 'checking', 'out', 'escaping', 'big', 'bad', 'cruel', 'world', 'Staight', 'Story', 'do', 'just']",The Straight Story VHS
