It was kinda funny, but plays on some dreaded fears faced by adult homeowners operating on a limited budget. Let's say you just bought your first home. It was an older model, but you got it for a good price (a steal). Then as you're moving in everything starts going wrong and needs repairs. Well, you know how hard it is to get repairs and how expensive. Then, after long delays, all the various repairmen show up at the same time. Well, almost any homeowner has experienced that sort of thing. Well multiply your experience by an order of magnitude and you have the basic plot of ""The Money Pit.""Hanks and Long play a pair of NYC lovers living in her ex-husband's vacant apartment while he is living in Europe. Well, he unexpectedly shows up so our pair are out house-hunting in the New York City area. They find an out-in-the-country, million-dollar mansion, on emergency sale for only $200K. They can't believe their good fortune and buy it with only a cursory examination. Well, what do you think follows? This mansion starts to fall apart in ways you couldn't even imagine. Everything collapses, goes up in smoke or runs over. It's almost painful for a home owner to watch. And with every little thing, you can see the dollar signs multiplying out of control. It is, indeed, a money pit! Then there are the repairs. Of course, nobody is immediately available and they all need up-front bucks to even think about fixing anything. Meanwhile, our couple is forced to live in their newly-acquired trash heap. Then to cap it all off, about a dozen different repair crews all show up on essentially the same day and the the whole fiasco turns into complete chaos. Naturally, the stress level gets so high that the couple splits, at least temporarily.Now, do you find this to be funny? Well, just look over some of the five-star reviews and some reviewers think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen in their lives.

Initially, I was incredulous about this because this movie has a special place in my heart as probably the funniest movie I've ever seen. But after I thought about it a bit, I think I understand the point made in that tribute.  This movie is not a showcase for actors, the uncontested star of this movie is the house.The three main actors, Hanks, Shelley Long, and Alexander Gudunov are all terrific in their roles, but the little love-triangle drama that goes on between them serves only as a backdrop and a reason to pull off all those ingenious sight-gags with the house.In this movie, the script writer and set technicians are king.  These professionals ought to have a showcase for their talents to be spotlighted from time to time, and they sure made the most of the opportunity with this one.  The calamitous frailty of this ostensibly beautiful house renders so many brilliantly done scenes that this movie still makes me laugh out loud after seeing it several times.  A joke loses all its power to amuse after the surprise of the punch-line is lost, but these sight-gags are so funny I can break out laughing while driving down a lonely highway just thinking about them.Some movies lose their effectiveness because the makers get confused and try to do too may things - the message gets muddled.  The best movies exhibit no such confusion and tell their story with minimal distraction.  This movie is about this house, and what these artists do with this prop is brilliantly and enduringly funny.Even in my business, where everyone has seen this movie, and we ought to be more serious, when anyone inquires about some project we know well will be completed when hell freezes over, if then, our stock answer is ""Two weeks!""",5,The house gets top billing,1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,1840,"['once', 'saw', 'tribute', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'where', 'dismissed', 'movie', 'one', 'inconsequential', 'early', 'works', 'Initially', 'was', 'incredulous', 'movie', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'probably', 'funniest', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'thought', 'bit', 'think', 'understand', 'point', 'made', 'tribute', 'movie', 'not', 'showcase', 'actors', 'uncontested', 'star', 'movie', 'house.The', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'Hanks', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'Alexander', 'Gudunov', 'are', 'terrific', 'roles', 'little', 'love-triangle', 'drama', 'only', 'backdrop', 'reason', 'pull', 'off', 'ingenious', 'sight-gags', 'house.In', 'movie', 'script', 'writer', 'set', 'technicians', 'are', 'king', 'professionals', 'ought', 'have', 'showcase', 'talents', 'be', 'spotlighted', 'time', 'time', 'sure', 'made', 'most', 'opportunity', 'one', 'calamitous', 'frailty', 'ostensibly', 'beautiful', 'house', 'renders', 'so', 'many', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'scenes', 'movie', 'still', 'loud', 'seeing', 'several', 'times', 'joke', 'power', 'amuse', 'surprise', 'punch-line', 'lost', 'sight-gags', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'can', 'break', 'out', 'laughing', 'driving', 'down', 'lonely', 'highway', 'just', 'thinking', 'them.Some', 'movies', 'lose', 'effectiveness', 'makers', 'get', 'confused', 'try', 'do', 'too', 'may', 'things', 'message', 'muddled', 'best', 'movies', 'exhibit', 'such', 'confusion', 'tell', 'story', 'minimal', 'distraction', 'movie', 'house', 'what', 'artists', 'do', 'prop', 'brilliantly', 'enduringly', 'funny.Even', 'business', 'where', 'everyone', 'seen', 'movie', 'ought', 'be', 'more', 'serious', 'when', 'anyone', 'project', 'know', 'well', 'will', 'be', 'completed', 'when', 'hell', 'then', 'stock', 'answer', 'Two', 'weeks']",N/A

I think this is worthy in its own right.As a matter of fact, I have quite personal reasons for appreciating this film. Some twelve  years ago, we actually went through an experience just like this one. True  enough, we never had to buy the house froma lady who dissolved in a flood  of tears while explaining how you know someone for twenty five years... And  then the Israeli secret service arrive.. It wasn't exactly like that. What  happened to us was that the house was discovered to have had dry rot - in  England this is the worst of bad news. Hanks discovers not just this, but  an impossible multiplication of similar things. Impossible - no. Once you  have experienced anything like this, you know just how terribly easy it all  is to slide into the money pit. (&quot;Mozart is dead, his troubles are  over, help ME!&quot;)The character who is the conductor is completely  plausible (I know exactly who the real life character is), and the  characters who come to fix the house are.. priceless.If you don't  believe this can really happen, you go, have two kids, find a house in  Farnborough and invite fate. In our case, the contractors didn't quite have  the style of the one's in the film (&quot;Quick. Write me a cheque before I  come to my senses&quot;). The ones I had to deal with, it must be said,  sadly, did not play Italian opera in their sports cars at 92 dB.I love  the way this movie had of making my wife and I laugh ourseleves stupid. It  really helped us cope with a humourless situation in real life, and I  salute Tom Hanks, who makes a fool of himself so well, and has probably  smoothed away so much real hurt in the real world. What a lovely man!If  you need any more convincing, skip to the last bit, where Tom and his  beloved are regularly trading insults, being spied on by the builders, and  finally decide to split just when the house is complete...  If you want a  squishy soft ending, this is it.Of course, the whole thing is manifestly  absurd, and bears no resemblence to real life.",5,"Very, very funny",948931200,"01 27, 2000",2000,2112,"['do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'movie', 'based', 'inferior', 'attempt', 'movie', 'think', 'worthy', 'own', 'right.As', 'matter', 'fact', 'have', 'quite', 'personal', 'reasons', 'appreciating', 'film', 'twelve', 'years', 'ago', 'actually', 'went', 'experience', 'just', 'one', 'True', 'enough', 'never', 'had', 'buy', 'house', 'froma', 'lady', 'who', 'dissolved', 'flood', 'tears', 'explaining', 'how', 'know', 'someone', 'twenty', 'five', 'years', 'then', 'Israeli', 'secret', 'service', 'arrive..', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'What', 'happened', 'was', 'house', 'was', 'discovered', 'have', 'had', 'dry', 'rot', 'England', 'worst', 'bad', 'news', 'Hanks', 'not', 'just', 'impossible', 'multiplication', 'similar', 'things', 'Impossible', 'Once', 'have', 'experienced', 'anything', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'terribly', 'easy', 'slide', 'money', 'pit', 'quot', 'Mozart', 'dead', 'troubles', 'are', 'help', 'ME', 'quot', 'character', 'who', 'conductor', 'completely', 'plausible', 'know', 'exactly', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'character', 'characters', 'who', 'come', 'fix', 'house', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'can', 'really', 'happen', 'go', 'have', 'two', 'kids', 'find', 'house', 'Farnborough', 'invite', 'fate', 'case', 'contractors', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'style', 'one', 'film', 'quot', 'Quick', 'Write', 'cheque', 'come', 'senses', 'quot', 'ones', 'had', 'deal', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'sadly', 'did', 'not', 'play', 'Italian', 'opera', 'sports', 'cars', '92', 'dB.I', 'love', 'way', 'movie', 'had', 'making', 'wife', 'laugh', 'ourseleves', 'stupid', 'really', 'helped', 'cope', 'humourless', 'situation', 'real', 'life', 'salute', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'who', 'fool', 'so', 'well', 'probably', 'smoothed', 'away', 'so', 'much', 'real', 'hurt', 'real', 'world', 'What', 'lovely', 'man', 'need', 'more', 'convincing', 'skip', 'last', 'bit', 'where', 'Tom', 'beloved', 'are', 'regularly', 'trading', 'insults', 'being', 'spied', 'builders', 'finally', 'decide', 'split', 'just', 'when', 'house', 'complete', 'want', 'squishy', 'soft', 'ending', 'it.Of', 'course', 'whole', 'thing', 'manifestly', 'absurd', 'resemblence', 'real', 'life']",N/A

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[32, 34]","&quot;The Money Pit&quot; is an underrated, romantic, slapstick comedy telling the story of an unmarried couple that unwittingly decides to purchase a large house in dire need of repair.  The couple, Walter Fielding, Jr. (Tom Hanks) and Anna Crowley Beissart (Shelley Long), have a strong relationship until Anna's former husband, Max Beissart (Alexander Godunov), returns to claim the apartment where they have been living in NYC.  Being forced to move, Walter and Anna decide to purchase a house and find what they believe is a dream house being sold by a seemingly eccentric widow, Estelle (Maureen Stapleton), in Long Island.  Walter and Anna hurriedly purchase the house and move in.  However, after a series of mishaps, they soon discover that their dream house has a number of problems.  Having both invested a sizeable amount of their savings into the house, Walter and Anna have no choice except to hire contractors with dubious reputations to repair the problems.Anyone who has dealt with home repair issues (as I have) will no doubt identify with the trials and tribulations endured by Walter and Anna.  Of course, many of the mishaps they experience in the film are exaggerated but very memorable, including the falling staircase, the crashing bathtub and the exploding kitchen.  Naturally, stress resulting from the amount of money invested, the various mishaps and the prolonged loss of privacy due to the presence of many construction workers severely tests Walter and Anna's relationship.  Max's presence as conductor of the symphony where Anna performs as a violinist doesn't help matters either.Being an exceptional actor, Tom Hanks did an excellent job with his portrayal of Walter, ranking equally with his performances in &quot;Splash&quot; (1984), &quot;Big&quot; (1988) and &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; (1990).  Shelley Long's performance is also quite good.  Other memorable characters in the film include the Shirk Brothers (the dubious contractors): Art Shirk (Joe Mantegna) and Brad Shirk (Carmine Caridi); as well as construction foreman Jack Schnittman (Josh Mostel).  Sadly, when the film was released in 1986, it was snubbed by critics and earned poor box office receipts.  Admittedly, the film is not perfect, but I rate &quot;The Money Pit&quot; with a very strong 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good slapstick comedy or to anyone contemplating the purchase or renovation of a house.  The film also has a strong and simple lesson: buyer beware.",4,An Underrated Comedy Starring Tom Hanks &amp; Shelley Long,1047513600,"03 13, 2003",2003,2516,"['quot', 'Money', 'Pit', 'quot', 'underrated', 'romantic', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'telling', 'story', 'unmarried', 'couple', 'unwittingly', 'purchase', 'large', 'house', 'dire', 'need', 'repair', 'couple', 'Walter', 'Fielding', 'Jr.', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Anna', 'Crowley', 'Beissart', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'have', 'strong', 'relationship', 'Anna', 'former', 'husband', 'Max', 'Beissart', 'Alexander', 'Godunov', 'claim', 'apartment', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'NYC', 'Being', 'forced', 'move', 'Walter', 'Anna', 'decide', 'purchase', 'house', 'find', 'what', 'believe', 'dream', 'house', 'being', 'sold', 'seemingly', 'eccentric', 'widow', 'Estelle', 'Maureen', 'Stapleton', 'Long', 'Island', 'Walter', 'Anna', 'hurriedly', 'purchase', 'house', 'move', 'However', 'series', 'mishaps', 'soon', 'discover', 'dream', 'house', 'number', 'problems', 'Having', 'invested', 'sizeable', 'amount', 'savings', 'house', 'Walter', 'Anna', 'have', 'choice', 'hire', 'contractors', 'dubious', 'reputations', 'repair', 'problems.Anyone', 'who', 'dealt', 'home', 'repair', 'issues', 'have', 'will', 'doubt', 'identify', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'endured', 'Walter', 'Anna', 'course', 'many', 'mishaps', 'experience', 'film', 'are', 'exaggerated', 'very', 'memorable', 'including', 'falling', 'staircase', 'crashing', 'bathtub', 'exploding', 'kitchen', 'Naturally', 'stress', 'resulting', 'amount', 'money', 'invested', 'various', 'mishaps', 'prolonged', 'loss', 'privacy', 'due', 'presence', 'many', 'construction', 'workers', 'severely', 'tests', 'Walter', 'Anna', 'relationship', 'Max', 'presence', 'conductor', 'symphony', 'where', 'Anna', 'violinist', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'either.Being', 'exceptional', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portrayal', 'Walter', 'ranking', 'equally', 'performances', 'quot', 'Splash', 'quot', '1984', 'quot', 'Big', 'quot', '1988', 'quot', 'Joe', 'Versus', 'Volcano', 'quot', '1990', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'performance', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Other', 'memorable', 'characters', 'film', 'include', 'Shirk', 'Brothers', 'dubious', 'contractors', 'Art', 'Shirk', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'Brad', 'Shirk', 'Carmine', 'Caridi', 'as', 'well', 'construction', 'foreman', 'Jack', 'Schnittman', 'Josh', 'Mostel', 'Sadly', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1986', 'was', 'snubbed', 'critics', 'earned', 'poor', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'Admittedly', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'rate', 'quot', 'Money', 'Pit', 'quot', 'very', 'strong', '4', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'anyone', 'contemplating', 'purchase', 'renovation', 'house', 'film', 'also', 'strong', 'simple', 'lesson', 'buyer', 'beware']",N/A

You make think The Money Pit was a huge film and in no way is b, which the point is valid. However almost every 80's comedy at this point can be found in the same category as b which leaves them all open to a nice Sid review. They all have really corny humor which walks the line of being b anyway, so why not treat them as such. It's a funny rainy afternoon flick and shows Tom Hanks in the light of still being likeable. Long before his days of boring drawn out big budget trash, the guy actually has something to offer.Hanks plays a guy named Walter who decides to purchase a house with his girlfriend after they get booted from their apartment. They find a huge place for a cheap price only to have it fall apart piece by piece. It's really one of those essential 80's comedies filled with brainless laughs. This is something Sid loves. We plan on doing a lot of 80's comedies in the near future and can tell you this is one we would have enjoyed back in the day.
