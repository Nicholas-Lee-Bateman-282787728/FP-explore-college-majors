1021898,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000ION726,Chris Pandolfi,"[2, 7]","One look at Steve Oedekerk's resume is enough to determine how much pride he takes in writing and directing silly films. Keep in mind that this is the man who gave us such films as ""Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls,"" ""Nothing to Lose,"" and ""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist."" He also contributed to numerous screenplays, including the remake of ""The Nutty Professor,"" ""Bruce Almighty,"" and the family friendly ""Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius."" He even created a series of entertaining short films in which thumbs act as puppets (the actors' faces are digitally superimposed onto them). It's obvious that you can't take any of these films seriously; they were created solely to entertain kids and adults alike with a juvenile sense of humor. While his films aren't exactly enlightening, complex, or meaningful, they definitely are a lot of fun.This is the way I feel about his latest film ""Barnyard."" This is such a loveable computer generated cartoon, filled with colorful characters, silly jokes, and a lighthearted story. It's also surprisingly sweet, with a couple of simple but significant tender moments shared between certain characters. I have to admit that I wasn't quite expecting that side of the story to be so effective, considering the ads make the entire film seem like a chaotic free-for-all. To some extent, the ads are correct; a good portion of ""Barnyard"" is comically over the top. But its actually a more structured film than it appears, going seamlessly from one sequence to the next without losing sight of what it sets out to accomplish.Does any of this make it a necessary film? Not really: when you think about it, most--if not all--cartoons are completely unnecessary. However, all the elements come together and deliver a fun film, one perfectly suited for younger children. I'm sure that even some adults can find the antics amusing. Of course, this is assuming that they can look past a couple of things, most notably the fact that male cows are portrayed with udders. Yes, it is a little odd that Oedekerk took some major liberties with species and gender, and I'm sure some anatomical purists will find this discrepancy too glaring to allow them to notice the rest of the film. But you have to understand that children don't really care about such things. If they can go with the flow, maybe you should too.That's because there's so much more to ""Barnyard,"" and if you're willing to take it in, you just might come away feeling satisfied. It tells the story of a group of animals led by Otis the Cow (Kevin James), and his father, Ben (Sam Elliott). Everyone behaves much like the toys of the ""Toy Story"" films do: they act one way in the presence of humans and another way when alone. In this case, the animals talk, stand on their hind legs, and even dance whenever the humans leave. They also like to party every night in a country/western dance club (by day known as the barn). It's complete with music and singing; I distinctly remember one especially fat rat singing Shaggy's ""Mr. Bombastic.""There are other humorous moments showing the division between humans and animals. At one point, Otis taunts a mailman while his back is turned. Whenever the mailman faces Otis, he immediately repositions himself to look like an ordinary cow. This is just the kind of behavior he's known for, along with a slew of other indiscretions. He doesn't take life very seriously; rather than take part in the organized world of the barn, he chooses to party every night and perform reckless stunts during the day. His attitude is very much like that of a teenager (which he probably is, despite the fact that the characters' ages are never given), especially in the way he communicates with his father. Ben is the leader of all the barnyard animals, and he takes his responsibility very seriously. The two couldn't be anything less alike, and it's understandably creating friction between them.And it couldn't come at a worse time. Coyote season is beginning, and soon the barnyard will be vulnerable to attacks. A pack of especially vicious coyotes--led by the ruthless Dag (David Koechner)--infiltrates the barn one night with the intent to snatch away a couple of hens. A pretty severe confrontation follows. I won't reveal its outcome, but I will say that it that forces the animals to reconsider how safe they really are. If anything good is to be gained from this whole experience, Otis has to learn how to be a leader, whether or not he wants the responsibility. From this, you can pretty much guess that maturing is the moral of the story. While not particularly original, it's still quite effective, especially when you factor in a budding romance.Here enters Daisy (Courtney Cox), a pregnant cow recently introduced to the barn. She takes a liking to Otis almost immediately, and Otis is certainly interested in her (despite being told off by her best friend, Bessy, voiced by none other than Wanda Sykes). The moments they share are both comical and endearing, if a little strained (due to his nervousness around women). It's clear that she's willing to support him, believing wholeheartedly that he has what it takes to be a leader. And when the coyotes kidnap a group of hens, he'll need that support more than ever; only he can save the helpless creatures and restore peace in the barnyard.It seems like I've been describing a pretty serious movie. Don't get the wrong impression: this is, from start to finish, a light, entertaining, silly children's movie, and it includes a number of purely comedic characters. There's Freddy (Cam Clarke), a hyperactive ferret that continuously makes chicken-eating Freudian slips; Miles (Danny Glover), a wise old Mule who likes to kick; Pip the Mouse (Jeffrey Garcia), Otis' best friend; Pig (Tino Insana), a perpetually muddy apple lover; and Peck (Rob Paulson), a featherless rooster who can't crow to save his life. There are also a couple of notable human characters. There's Mrs. Beady (Maria Bamford), whose lazy, beer-guzzling husband (Steve Oedekerk) is unwilling to believe a word she says. There's also Snotty Boy (also voiced by Oedekerk), a fat, red headed kid who takes pleasure in cow tipping.""Barnyard"" is a cartoon about talking animals. It's not meant to be realistic or even plausible, and I think going into it with that mindset will help a great deal. I had a lot of fun watching this movie, and I hope those of you willing to look past the anatomical inaccuracies will too. Who cares if Steve Oedekerk gave udders to his male cow characters? It's such a minor problem, especially when you take into consideration the fact that animals can't really talk. I'm glad I saw ""Barnyard""; it's a pleasing, light film that had me smiling from start to finish.",4,You'll Have Fun 'Til the Cows Come Home,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",2006,6729,"['One', 'look',

Fourth, the Otis and Daisy thing could have been approached better.  Finally, a lot of glorified hoodlum vandalism, glorifying drinking and bad behavior. That is why this should not be watched with anyone under about 10, unless you want crying youngsters, or ""broken records"" of kids rattling off catch dumb catch phrases.The reason I did not give this a 1 or 2 stars is that as an adult film, this was pretty darn funny, annoying, but funny.

This is adult-funny, but don't misinterpret: there is nothing raunchy in the script. It's not totally innocent, either.I do wave a ""red flag"" for small kids. There are a couple of scenes in here that are definitely too scary for little ones. I am referring to a pack of coyotes attacking ""Ben,"" the father character seen early in the movie, and literally killing him. That, and the short funeral scene, are too intense for impressionable kids. Later, the coyotes return a few times, too. Those mothers who complained about their little kids seeing this have a legitimate point.Nonetheless, for me - and I assume most other adults - the rest of this is pure entertainment, with a little sentiment mixed into the comedy as the main character, ""Otis"" (voiced by Kevin James) learns to grow up. Otis is one of the funniest characters I have ever seen on film, animated or not. When he and his barnyard pals are partying it up, which is frequently, it's just hilarious. With those parties comes some great music, too.

It looked like there was absolutely no effort put into this one. Why did the creators even bother writing the script for this? Didn't they know that this would be an awful idea from the start?! Okay, first off, everyone is talking about the udders. Yes, it's true. There are male cows that have udders! Why?! Aren't the females the only ones who have them? And the males are BULLS! BULLS! So it's clear that the creators didn't do any bit of research. Secondly, the animation is . . . just not superb. It's lacks substance, and it lacks beauty. It shows the truly ugly side of CGI; nothing here is good. Another downside to Barnyard is the lack of humor. This is absolutely unfunny: none of the jokes really work, and the sight gags are so overused. Couldn't they get Mel Brooks to write the screenplay? The fourth problem about this film is the typical list of stars. Why get James, Glover, Cox, and Sykes when you can get real professional voice actors? I guess it's always about money. And the biggest flaw of all is the similarities with The Lion King. Honestly, this is an exact ripoff of a timeless classic! The ""father-and-son"" relationship is here, the Hamlet references are here; I was expecting ""Hakuna Matata"" to be sung halfway through the film!This is an abomination among animated features. Nothing is good about it, and nothing is funny about it, and certainly nothing is dramatic about it. Just because you have CGI animation doesn't mean it'll automatically turn this into a great film!

So, she listens to a lot of electronica and I watch a lot of cartoons. It's a fair tradeoff, and I generally enjoy the animations as a form of light entertainment.So, one of the latest animated movie we watched was the ""Barnyard"" DVD. Somehow, it reminded me of the old Gary Larsen newspaper cartoon drawings. The animals walked around on all fours (or twos) when the farmer was around, but became bipedal and acted like humans when they were alone. Even the drawings had a Gary Larsen look. The animals would watch television, play practical jokes on one another and party, party, party. One of the elder cows acted as a protector, watched over the proceedings and kept a wary eye out for the nasty coyotes. He expected his son to grow up and take over his barnyard leadership position. His son, however, wanted only the party life.When the elder cow was no longer able to lead and protect, the younger tried to step in, but being a leader and protector did not come naturally to him. Absolute chaos took over. The farmer discovered the animals' secret life. The coyotes began to think that the farm was vulnerable. Finally, order was restored.It's a mildly amusing movie, but there are much better animated cartoons around. The plot was extremely light and the animation was not particularly good. For me, watching it was largely a waste of time. I could only give it three stars, at best.

Partying barn yard animals is normally not my cup of tea.  But in the end, I actually found it insightful and even funny in parts.Kevin James is the voice of Otis who is more interested in partying while is father, Ben, keeps watch over the farm from harm.  But when tragedy strikes and Otis is placed in charge in Ben's stead the movie turns into a coming-of-age story while Otis learns to protect those under his watch.Sound familiar?  Part way through the movie I realized that this was a ripoff of the Lion King.  But even that was a ripoff of Shakespeare so I did find that I could forgive for it, especially since it was well disguised with a lot of originality.I normally don't notice this, but the music score was quite enjoyable to boot.

1021940,A29THQFOAB9U4U,B000ION726,Jeep Girl,"[5, 10]","This is a super movie, I took my grade school boys to it and they laughed outloud!  This is a very funny animated film about the secret lives of barn yard animals and their desires to be more than milkers and meat sources.  There are many scenes where the animals mock us humans, the farmer and his wife, the mailman (one of the funniest scenes), and many more.  I don't agree with other reviewers the these scenes are inappropriate, they're just real life, clean and fun.  This film is rated PG, probably not intended for 5 and under unless their not afraid of attacking wolves.  Not only is this a super funny movie, it sends a strong lesson in responsibility, a father-son dialogue between Ben, the wise and protective bull, and Otis, the adolescent cow who's full of mischief.  When I took my kids to this movie I thought I was just a tag along but it was such a tender and moving story line, I actually cried when Otis realized his dad had died. The characters were so realistic in how they grieved, it really was a tender moment.  I was pleasantly surprised that this movie was not just a another cartoon entertainment film but full of inspiration and responsiblity.

To me this film at times feels like it was made by the Farrelly Brothers. It's slapstick humor and it's wildly nutty behavior that makes it look like an R-rated comedy, makes it all the while more funny The story is sort of like a parody of Lion King. Farmers on a farm are keeping animals under their eye and well protected. And animals pretty much behave like, well, animals. But what happens when the farmers out. Well, the party begins, as these animals somehow behave more like humans, crazily partying around with the rest of the animals. And a carefree cow is held responsible for whatever goes on. He's in charge. And he needs to protect the farm from their enemies, the Coyotes. Otis the carefree cow, pretty much don't take it seriously. Ben, a cow who takes it very seriously is giving advice to Otis to grow up and all that. When Ben is no longer able to lead, Otis tries to keep order but the role of leader does not come as naturally for him. Without Ben to keep everyone in line, absolute mayhem breaks loose and it isn't long before the farmer begins to get to the bottom of the animals' secret--and the scheming coyotes begin to think that the farm could be theirs for the taking.Just don't take this film seriously, especially not the story. The problem with the film is that, we've seen it all before. They are either about animals, or insects, or well CARS. And this film has similarities with many animated films. The story is nothing new at all. And that is its drawback. And its approach is rather conventional with dumb looking characters that are half baked. But there are sweet moments that don't get too sentimental. Another weakness is it's weaker than expected animation. It's not fair to have such an average animation to a funny movie. If the film's animation was heighten to a better quality, it would've been better than it already was.However, I really liked the jokes, which seem to have been aimed at adults. But the animation was passable. The film has some really outrageously hilarious moments, giving you snort out loud laughs. The animals are more human-like than actual animals, and they love partying around, all night. They behave like those characters from Ace Ventura films or other Oedekerk films. In short, it's simply a mindless comedy with a lot of great laughs.

On a peaceful farm, the animals are more than they seem.  When people are asleep they get up on their hind legs, start talking, and generally run things while the humans are asleep.  Sam Elliot voiced the father who is the head animal who keep everyone safe and makes sure the humans never learn the truth.  Unfortunately his son just wants to party and have fun.  Things are pretty good under his reign but what will happen when the son eventually takes over?  Well that is just what this story is going to find out.When the son finds himself in charge he still just wants to have fun and not be responsible.  But dangers provided by local coyotes and snotty kids awaken a sense of justice which eventually transmutes into responsibility.  But the road is not necessarily an easy one.So what did I see?  Well, Elliot and son (and the guys he hangs out with) are all large-uddered cows!  Not bulls.  Cows!  Eventually two female cows show up in the story (you can tell by the bows on their heads).  I loved the story.  It was a great coming of age tale and real father/son tale.  But the guys are cows and cows are females!  In all of the commentaries and actor interviews, no one mentions that the guys in the story have girls bodies.

Yes, I instantly picked up on the fact that the supposed bulls in this flick had udders.  However, I don't think this was done with the intention of creating a transsexual farming atmosphere.  Instead, I think it was just Hollywood failing to do their research properly.  With that said, just keep in mind that Barbie dolls don't even have ""plumbing"" and most animated characters lack genitals altogether.Now, on to the movie, which was very funny.  I have to admit that it has a lukewarm beginning and I was starting to give up on it, but once the fun does kick in, it's almost non-stop.  Kevin James is very good as Otis, the fun-loving son of Ben (voiced by near-legendary Western performer, Sam Elliott.  When a tragedy befalls the farm, Otis is put in charge and has to protect the other animals from the vicious coyotes who are led by Dag (David Koechner).  The rest of the farm animals are voiced by a number of popular actors and actresses.  Courteney Cox plays Daisy, Otis' love interest, and Wanda Sykes is hilarious as Bessy, Daisy's overprotective best friend.  Another easily recognized voice is Danny Glover as Miles, an old and wise mule who helps guide Otis on his journey to becoming a great leader.  Andie McDowell throws in her Texas drawl as Etta the hen as well.I have to say that I was surprised to find out that Koechner portrayed the mean and vile leader of the coyotes, Dag.  It would seem as if he was poorly cast for the role, but director/writer Steve Oedekerk knew what he was doing when he tossed Koechner into the film.

Seeing the promo (after the movie) for a Barnyard TV series this fall only confirmed what I already knew. Barnyard was just a TV pilot released to the theaters. And it has all the problems of the usual kiddy TV show: everything is medium instead of well done, with maudlin segments to try to jerk tears, and lessons taught so heavy-handedly that I expected to see the E/I tag in the corner of the screen. Overall, the best way to describe this movie is TV bland.I did note that while the story was similar to The Lion King--main character comes back from his lazy wastrel lifestyle to inexplicably have the ability to save the day--there was more of an attempt at character development in Barnyard. But not enough to make me care.I thought it was funny that, when Barnyard was released, half the world carried on about the fact that the bulls had udders. Steve Oedekirk's answer to that was, udders are funny. And that, combined with the skillful editing for the movie's trailers, had me thinking the movie would be funny. It wasn't, really.I think a better observation about the bulls would be, why don't the bulls have horns? To keep the Christian fundamentalists from asserting that there is a demonic element to them? You have to think of such things when you're designing a TV show.I don't hate this movie--I'm not that emotionally invested in it. There's nothing in it to care about. I probably would have been better off spending 90 minutes channel surfing--I might have stumbled across something interesting.

However, with some great gags and well designed characters, I simply didn't care that I more-or-less knew how the story would end.  It was a lot of fun.The deleted scenes in the bonus stuff are actually quite good.  I wish several of them had not been deleted.  I think they would have made for a better movie.  But the deleted scenes have commentary too, so you can learn why they weren't included in the final product.Probably what I appreciate about this movie more than anything is that is isn't just about gags.  This movie illustrates that life isn't fair, and that tragedy can happen to people when they are way to young to deal with it, but nevertheless they can overcome it and rise above themselves and become great.  Evil doesn't ask us when it's convenient for us to oppose it, but oppose it we must whether we're ready or not.So, here you've got some great gags woven into a story of family values (and the nobility of fatherhood in particular), teamwork, courage, and fun.

(2) You'll find yourself watching this a ZILLION times -- because its so very story and features-rich; has many great quote-worthy scenes in Extras.Speaking of Extras, the voice-over commentary is the only thing of the whole package that's weak; it provides far less information than one would want on the movie production process.

1021978,AHF97M45JFCB,B000ION726,ONENEO,"[1, 1]","If you could go back to 2006, you'd find yourself smack dab in the middle of the talking animal computer generated feature film era.  Blue Sky was riding high on the Ice Age films, DreamWorks had Madagascar & Over the Hedge, Sony had Open Season and even Disney wanted in with The Wild.  Nickelodeon/ Paramount Pictures wanted in on the action and that leads us to Barnyard- The Original Party Animals.I suppose the only way to begin this review is to come out with the cold hard facts- compiling all of the major critical reviews of this piece around the web results in a very underwhelming 2-star average.  Naturally this would lead you to suspect the film is an absolute abomination when in fact it's not nearly as bad as many CG features on the market these days (namely those foreign films that are dubbed in English and dropped on our doorstep as something new).  In fact, the film was considered successful enough for Nickelodeon to warrant 52-episodes of the spin-off series Back at the Barnyard (2007-2011).  It should also be noted that while it faired poorly with critics, it was considered quite a success financially having cost less than $51-million to produce but raking in over $116.5 million worldwide.The film comes in at a runtime of 90 minutes and wears an appropriate PG rating due to some comic peril, cartoony violence and the usual mischief one would expect from Nickelodeon.The concept here works on the principle that when the kind-hearted vegan farmer goes to bed at night, the docile barnyard turns into a full fledge society onto itself with animals popping up on their hind legs, talking, singing, dancing and in many cases, causing extreme mischief (let's just say they bring a new definition to the concept of grand theft auto before this one's over).The film follows Ben (Sam Elliot), a broad shouldered, soft spoken bull (oddly enough with a big ol plunger-looking udder) attempting to teach his son Otis (Kevin James) the responsibility that comes with guarding the barnyard from threats like coyote.  Otis, however, is busy surrounding himself with other party animals; goofing off, dancing and essentially being Kevin James.  It's much publicized but still worth mentioning- all of the male cows have utters for whatever reason here.  You identify females by a bow on their head.  Biology teachers the world over must love this one.Anyway, along the way there are a surprising number of song and dance routines, not the least of which include James (Otis) belting out a number of his own and some involving an odd living hairball who occasionally pops out of a crate to turn the entire barn into a techno dancehall.Amidst all that partying enters Daisy (Courtney Cox), a pregnant refugee cow who apparently lost her husband to a storm to serve as Otis' love interest.  When Ben meets his match attempting to defend the farm from a marauding band of coyotes led by Dag (David Koechner), Otis suddenly finds himself inheriting his father's responsibility whether he's ready for it or not.  And I'll give you a hint- he's not.About the biggest problem here stems from the fact that any laughter comes from the movie's absurdity and not its comedy or cleverness (despite some genuinely funny set ups like the neurotic neighbor lady and her cynical beer swilling husband).  Kids will surely delight in the endless silliness and on-screen gags aplenty but the adults are going to have to trudge along without the benefit of some nice Pixar or DreamWorks layered depth.Visually the film wasn't exactly cutting edge, even back in 06 with a style that's eerily reminiscent of Jim Davis' comic strip US Acres.  The textures are colorful and crisp however even of the character models maintain a certain degree of pudgy ""roundness"".In all, Barnyard has lived up to the expectations of many by essentially fading into oblivion in the highly competitive industry that is the CG-animated film business but that's not to say it doesn't have a bit of charm should you or yours find it in a discount bin while getting groceries.",3,"Decent Enough For Kids, Adults May Not Get Past The Goofiness",1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,4048,"['could', 'go', 'back', '2006', ""'d"", 'find', 'smack', 'dab', 'middle', 'talking', 'animal', 'computer', 'generated', 'feature', 'film', 'era', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'was', 'riding', 'high', 'Ice', 'Age', 'films', 'DreamWorks', 'had', 'Madagascar', 'Hedge', 'Sony', 'had', 'Open', 'Season', 'even', 'Disney', 'wanted', 'Wild', 'Nickelodeon/', 'Paramount', 'Pictures', 'wanted', 'action', 'Barnyard-', 'Original', 'Party', 'Animals.I', 'suppose', 'only', 'way', 'begin', 'review', 'come', 'out', 'cold', 'hard', 'facts-', 'compiling', 'major', 'critical', 'reviews', 'piece', 'web', 'results', 'very', 'underwhelming', '2-star', 'average', 'Naturally', 'would', 'lead', 'suspect', 'film', 'absolute', 'abomination', 'when', 'fact', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'many', 'CG', 'features', 'market', 'days', 'namely', 'foreign', 'films', 'are', 'dubbed', 'English', 'dropped', 'doorstep', 'something', 'new', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'considered', 'successful', 'enough', 'Nickelodeon', 'warrant', '52-episodes', 'spin-off', 'series', 'Back', 'Barnyard', '2007-2011', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'faired', 'poorly', 'critics', 'was', 'considered', 'quite', 'success', 'financially', 'having', 'cost', 'less', '51-million', 'produce', 'raking', '116.5', 'million', 'worldwide.The', 'film', 'runtime', '90', 'minutes', 'appropriate', 'PG', 'rating', 'due', 'comic', 'peril', 'cartoony', 'violence', 'usual', 'mischief', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Nickelodeon.The', 'concept', 'here', 'principle', 'when', 'kind-hearted', 'vegan', 'farmer', 'bed', 'night', 'docile', 'barnyard', 'full', 'fledge', 'society', 'animals', 'popping', 'up', 'hind', 'legs', 'talking', 'singing', 'dancing', 'many', 'cases', 'causing', 'extreme', 'mischief', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'bring', 'new', 'definition', 'concept', 'grand', 'theft', 'auto', 'one', '.The', 'film', 'Ben', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'broad', 'shouldered', 'soft', 'spoken', 'bull', 'oddly', 'enough', 'big', 'ol', 'plunger-looking', 'udder', 'attempting', 'teach', 'son', 'Otis', 'Kevin', 'James', 'responsibility', 'guarding', 'barnyard', 'threats', 'coyote', 'Otis', 'however', 'busy', 'surrounding', 'other', 'party', 'animals', 'goofing', 'off', 'dancing', 'essentially', 'being', 'Kevin', 'James', 'much', 'publicized', 'still', 'worth', 'mentioning-', 'male', 'cows', 'have', 'utters', 'reason', 'here', 'identify', 'females', 'bow', 'head', 'Biology', 'world', 'must', 'love', 'one.Anyway', 'way', 'are', 'surprising', 'number', 'song', 'dance', 'routines', 'not', 'least', 'include', 'James', 'Otis', 'belting', 'out', 'number', 'own', 'involving', 'odd', 'living', 'hairball', 'who', 'occasionally', 'crate', 'turn', 'entire', 'barn', 'techno', 'dancehall.Amidst', 'partying', 'enters', 'Daisy', 'Courtney', 'Cox', 'pregnant', 'refugee', 'cow', 'who', 'apparently', 'lost', 'husband', 'storm', 'serve', 'Otis', 'love', 'interest', 'When', 'Ben', 'match', 'attempting', 'defend', 'farm', 'marauding', 'band', 'coyotes', 'led', 'Dag', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Otis', 'suddenly', 'inheriting', 'father', 'responsibility', 'ready', 'not', ""'ll"", 'give', 'hint-', 'biggest', 'problem', 'here', 'fact', 'laughter', 'movie', 'absurdity', 'not', 'comedy', 'cleverness', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'set', 'ups', 'neurotic', 'neighbor', 'lady', 'cynical', 'beer', 'swilling', 'husband', 'Kids', 'will', 'surely', 'delight', 'endless', 'silliness', 'on-screen', 'gags', 'aplenty', 'adults', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'trudge', 'along', 'benefit', 'nice', 'Pixar', 'DreamWorks', 'layered', 'depth.Visually', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'cutting', 'edge', 'even', 'back', '06', 'style', 'eerily', 'reminiscent', 'Jim', 'Davis', 'comic', 'strip', 'US', 'Acres', 'textures', 'are', 'colorful', 'crisp', 'however', 'even', 'character', 'models', 'maintain', 'certain', 'degree', 'pudgy', 'roundness', 'Barnyard', 'lived', 'up', 'expectations', 'many', 'essentially', 'fading', 'oblivion', 'highly', 'competitive', 'industry', 'CG-animated', 'film', 'business', 'not', 'say', ""n't"", 'have', 'bit', 'charm', 'should', 'yours', 'find', 'discount', 'bin', 'getting', 'groceries']",N/A

Second, bulls and steers have teats, but not udders as portrayed in Barnyard.Most of the movie is as silly as a bull with an udder. But I was entertained and my kids were entertained. We all pretty much chuckled in the same places. My 7 year old got all the jokes, but some of the more crude/adult-aside humor was over my 5 year old's head.And the movie is not all crude and unusual punishment. It's got its lesson about life's priorities and loyalty to friends. So there's some ""family value"" to the film.The biggest laugh we all got wasn't even a deliberate attempt by the film; it was when Pip the Mouse voiced by Jeff Garcia spoke (or should I say ""uddered""? Okay, over-using the utter substitution) his first words. The three of us all said simultaneously, ""Hey! It's Sheen from Jimmy Neutron!"" I know...it's sad that I knew that too.And indeed, just as Jimmy Neutron is a Nickelodeon produced CGI TV show, so is Barnyard a CGI Nick produced movie. And I hear the plan is to further cash in on Barnyard's near $100MM theatrical success with a follow on TV show, albeit without most of the theatrical big-name voice talent (like lead Kevin James, Courtney Cox, Danny Glover, Sam Elliott and Andie MacDowell). I'm sure Garcia will be back for the TV show and rumor has it that Wanda Sykes is back too.So if you didn't get enough Barnyard in the theater or on DVD, you have more to look forward to...exposed udders and all.Of the 13 CGI 2006 films (Barnyard, Cars, The Wild, Happy Feet, Doogal, Open Season, Monster House, Chicken Little, Over the Hedge, The Ant Bully, Hoodwinked, Ice Age 2 & Flushed Away), Barnyard is not a standout. But it nevertheless keeps the kids in their seats when I throw it into the player.

In the 3-D animated (kids) movie genre, there are two companies that rule the scene, in Pixar and Dreamworks. So what happens when Nickelodeon, known for kids programming, tries to put out their own 3-D animated movie? You get Barnyard, 2006's addition to the ever growing animated scene.Barnyard is a fun film about the animals of a farm, and how they co-exist with each other, the farmers that own them, and their world outside of the farm's fences. The main story involves cows Ben (Sam Elliott) and Otis (Kevin James) as protectors of th farm, Otis and his ""gang"" of trouble-causers, and Otis and his possible romantic interest Daisy (Courtney Cox).Ben is Barnyard's head honcho, and he wants to pass on that role to Otis (who is his ""adopted"" son) when he's no longer able to protect everyone. Protect everyone from what, you might ask? The coyotes, led by Dag (David Koechner), who want to eat a spare animal here and there living at the farm. Ben does a great job of fighting off the coyotes here and there, all while singing Won't Back Down by Tom Petty, keeping the farm a great place to live. The problem is Otis is a partier who wants nothing to do with responsibility and just wants to keep his carefree life style. All of this is fine and dandy, until Ben gets jumped by the coyotes while everyone else is out partying, and passes away. Otis feels guilty, and takes over the lead role in his own ""carefree"" way, which leads to a handful of problems, and the rest of the movie deals with him learning what it means to be responsible for his own actions, as well as how to be a protector for the ones he loves.This movie is one of the better animated films story wise, but as for the graphics themselves, they are NOWHERE near the kind of thing you'll see out of a Pixar or Dreamworks film. I definitely applaud Nickelodeon's attempt to make an animated film, but you can see that they're new to the scene. The animations/designs aren't as crisp as other films that are out, and the world is very static, with not a lot of things happening in the backgrounds of scenes.The characters are all very enjoyable and ""humanized"", where you can feel what they're feeling, or at least relate to what's going on. Ben's burial scene is one of the saddest things you'll see in an animated scene (besides Up, which brings the tears about 10 min in). It's also hilarious watching the talking animals interact with their human counterparts. That's right, in this one, the humans can hear what the animals are saying, which leads for a memorable scene involving ""boy tipping"".Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, as it relays a good family message of enjoying your loved ones while they are around, and how to enjoy life without taking it to extremes that can hurt not only yourself, but people around you.",5,My review,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",2010,2944,"['today', 'movie', 'scene', 'are', 'lot', 'production', 'companies', 'putting', 'out', 'movies', 'there', 'handful', 'constantly', 'put', 'out', 'hits', '3-D', 'animated', 'kids', 'movie', 'genre', 'are', 'two', 'companies', 'rule', 'scene', 'Pixar', 'Dreamworks', 'what', 'when', 'Nickelodeon', 'known', 'kids', 'programming', 'tries', 'put', 'out', 'own', '3-D', 'animated', 'movie', 'get', 'Barnyard', '2006', 'addition', 'ever', 'growing', 'animated', 'scene.Barnyard', 'fun', 'film', 'animals', 'farm', 'how', 'co-exist', 'other', 'farmers', 'own', 'world', 'farm', 'fences', 'main', 'story', 'cows', 'Ben', 'Sam', 'Elliott', 'Otis', 'Kevin', 'James', 'protectors', 'th', 'farm', 'Otis', 'gang', 'trouble-causers', 'Otis', 'possible', 'romantic', 'interest', 'Daisy', 'Courtney', 'Cox', '.Ben', 'Barnyard', 'head', 'honcho', 'pass', 'role', 'Otis', 'who', 'adopted', 'son', 'when', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'protect', 'everyone', 'Protect', 'everyone', 'what', 'might', 'ask', 'coyotes', 'led', 'Dag', 'David', 'Koechner', 'who', 'want', 'eat', 'spare', 'animal', 'here', 'there', 'living', 'farm', 'Ben', 'great', 'job', 'fighting', 'off', 'coyotes', 'here', 'there', 'singing', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Back', 'Down', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'keeping', 'farm', 'great', 'place', 'live', 'problem', 'Otis', 'partier', 'who', 'nothing', 'do', 'responsibility', 'just', 'keep', 'carefree', 'life', 'style', 'fine', 'dandy', 'Ben', 'jumped', 'coyotes', 'everyone', 'else', 'out', 'partying', 'away', 'Otis', 'guilty', 'over', 'lead', 'role', 'own', 'carefree', 'way', 'handful', 'problems', 'rest', 'movie', 'deals', 'learning', 'what', 'be', 'responsible', 'own', 'actions', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'be', 'protector', 'ones', 'loves.This', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'animated', 'films', 'story', 'wise', 'graphics', 'are', 'NOWHERE', 'kind', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Pixar', 'Dreamworks', 'film', 'definitely', 'applaud', 'Nickelodeon', 'attempt', 'make', 'animated', 'film', 'can', 'see', ""'re"", 'new', 'scene', 'animations/designs', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'crisp', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'out', 'world', 'very', 'static', 'not', 'lot', 'things', 'happening', 'backgrounds', 'scenes.The', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'humanized', 'where', 'can', 'feel', 'what', ""'re"", 'feeling', 'least', 'relate', 'what', 'going', 'Ben', 'burial', 'scene', 'one', 'saddest', 'things', ""'ll"", 'see', 'animated', 'scene', 'Up', 'tears', '10', 'min', 'also', 'hilarious', 'watching', 'talking', 'animals', 'interact', 'human', 'counterparts', 'right', 'one', 'humans', 'can', 'hear', 'what', 'animals', 'are', 'saying', 'memorable', 'scene', 'involving', 'boy', 'tipping', '.Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'good', 'family', 'message', 'enjoying', 'loved', 'ones', 'are', 'around', 'how', 'enjoy', 'life', 'taking', 'extremes', 'can', 'hurt', 'not', 'only', 'people']",N/A

That's right, even the bulls have udders (except for the bull that rides the man-riding machine--he's the only male cow who even looks like a bull).  Director Steve Oedekerk has said that he wanted all the cows, even the males, to have udders because he thought it was incredibly funny.  The idea is kind of humorous, but after a moment the juvenile joke loses its humor and the gag seems incredibly strange and bizarre.  The male cows just don't look right and those udders are completely distracting; they should be covered up or something.  Of course, the cows aren't the only creature in the BARNYARD that have little appearance to their real life counterparts.  For example, there's a golden-colored ferret that lives on the farm who looks more like a cat than a ferret. He keeps envisioning his barnyard chicken friends as roasted birds.  In the wild, ferrets prefer eating rodents and small underground-dwelling creatures to birds.  Then there are the coyotes.  In the movie, the coyotes live and hunt together in a massive pack.  They are also portrayed as blood-thirsty creatures who are cunning and sly. In reality coyotes really don't hunt in packs and they aren't as vicious as wolves.  Coyotes are scavengers and tend to eat dead or dying animals.  These are the most obvious distinctions between the cartoon animals of BARNYARD and their real life counterparts, but there are several others.  Which is kind of the point.  The animals in BARNYARD aren't meant to be anything like real life animals.  They are cartoon characters created solely for the purpose of amusement and entertainment.  If you are able to understand that and view the film from a child's perspective, the movie is quite amusing.Copying a storyline that Disney copied and perfected in THE LION KING, BARNYARD is about a cow named Otis (Kevin James) and how he became the protector of the farm barnyard.  Otis is a cow who likes to have fun and party.  When he first appears on screen he's preparing to slide down a hill on a surfboard tied to a block of ice. However, the board tips the wrong way and Otis and his friends go flying through the air.  This is contrasted to his adopted father, Ben (Sam Elliot), who is the very organized leader of the animals in the barnyard.  Ben knows his responsibility and he takes it quite seriously.  Under Ben's leadership no animals on the farm have been killed by any predators, especially the coyotes.  But the coyote pack has been growing in numbers and sneaks into the barnyard to steal some chickens while Otis and most of the other animals are having a major party in the barn.  Ben comes to the rescue and saves the day, but at a great cost.  Soon, Otis finds himself in charge and the barnyard goes chaotic.  Even the coyotes think life will be more carefree with Otis in charge, but not if the farmer first discovers how his critters really live.Besides the obvious similarities to THE LION KING, I also felt while watching BARNYARD that it seemed like a water-downed and cruder version of JIMMY NEUTRON.  After watching the extras on the DVD, I learned that not only was the director the same guy who wrote the JIMMY NEUTRON movie, but that like JIMMY NEUTRON, BARNYARD is going to be a new series on Nickleodeon for Fall 2007.Besides the distraction of the male cows' udders, BARNYARD is a pretty funny cartoon film.  The most original thing about the film are the antics that the animals do when people aren't present:  walking around, ordering pizza, throwing parties, boy-tipping, driving cars, etc.  Even this idea isn't new, but it is done creatively in the movie.  I enjoyed the movie and laughed a few times.  I especially like the nighttime barnyard party scene.The animation is clearly directed at children, but many of the jokes in the film will only be understood by older children and adults.  Children will probably enjoy watching the film because of the animals and all the bright colors, but they won't understand much of the humor.  Nevertheless, as far as I could tell, there wasn't anything overtly suggestive so it's a movie that if you can overlook the udders, most people in the family can enjoy watching together.The DVD includes the usual filmmaker commentary.  There are some deleted scenes, but none of them ever made it into the completed production phase.  There are several featurettes including ""Utter Talent-Voices of BARNYARD"" that talks with most of the featured cast members, ""Method Acting With Kevin James"" which is a short of James learning how to be a cow from real live cows, and ""An Animator's Life"" which examines some of the people who made BARNYARD and their work environment.  There are two music videos and several games as well as some picture pages.",3,Life on the Farm,1170979200,"02 9, 2007",2007,4839,"['first', 'thing', 'need', 'know', 'BARNYARD', 'cows', 'movie', 'have', 'udders', 'including', 'males', 'right', 'even', 'bulls', 'have', 'udders', 'bull', 'man-riding', 'machine', 'only', 'male', 'cow', 'who', 'even', 'bull', 'Director', 'Steve', 'Oedekerk', 'said', 'wanted', 'cows', 'even', 'males', 'have', 'udders', 'thought', 'was', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'idea', 'kind', 'humorous', 'moment', 'juvenile', 'joke', 'humor', 'gag', 'incredibly', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'male', 'cows', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'right', 'udders', 'are', 'completely', 'distracting', 'should', 'be', 'covered', 'up', 'something', 'course', 'cows', 'are', ""n't"", 'only', 'creature', 'BARNYARD', 'have', 'little', 'appearance', 'real', 'life', 'counterparts', 'example', 'golden-colored', 'ferret', 'farm', 'who', 'more', 'cat', 'ferret', 'envisioning', 'barnyard', 'chicken', 'roasted', 'birds', 'wild', 'ferrets', 'prefer', 'eating', 'rodents', 'small', 'underground-dwelling', 'creatures', 'birds', 'Then', 'are', 'coyotes', 'movie', 'coyotes', 'live', 'hunt', 'together', 'massive', 'pack', 'are', 'also', 'portrayed', 'blood-thirsty', 'creatures', 'who', 'are', 'cunning', 'sly', 'reality', 'coyotes', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'hunt', 'packs', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'vicious', 'wolves', 'Coyotes', 'are', 'scavengers', 'tend', 'eat', 'dead', 'dying', 'animals', 'are', 'most', 'obvious', 'distinctions', 'cartoon', 'animals', 'BARNYARD', 'real', 'life', 'counterparts', 'are', 'several', 'others', 'Which', 'kind', 'point', 'animals', 'BARNYARD', 'are', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'anything', 'real', 'life', 'animals', 'are', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'created', 'solely', 'purpose', 'amusement', 'entertainment', 'are', 'able', 'understand', 'view', 'film', 'child', 'perspective', 'movie', 'quite', 'amusing.Copying', 'storyline', 'Disney', 'copied', 'perfected', 'THE', 'LION', 'KING', 'BARNYARD', 'cow', 'named', 'Otis', 'Kevin', 'James', 'how', 'became', 'protector', 'farm', 'barnyard', 'Otis', 'cow', 'who', 'have', 'fun', 'party', 'When', 'first', 'screen', 'preparing', 'slide', 'down', 'hill', 'surfboard', 'tied', 'block', 'ice', 'However', 'board', 'wrong', 'way', 'Otis', 'friends', 'go', 'flying', 'air', 'contrasted', 'adopted', 'father', 'Ben', 'Sam', 'Elliot', 'who', 'very', 'organized', 'leader', 'animals', 'barnyard', 'Ben', 'responsibility', 'quite', 'seriously', 'Ben', 'leadership', 'animals', 'farm', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'predators', 'especially', 'coyotes', 'coyote', 'pack', 'been', 'growing', 'numbers', 'sneaks', 'barnyard', 'steal', 'chickens', 'Otis', 'most', 'other', 'animals', 'are', 'having', 'major', 'party', 'barn', 'Ben', 'rescue', 'day', 'great', 'cost', 'Soon', 'Otis', 'charge', 'barnyard', 'chaotic', 'Even', 'coyotes', 'think', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'carefree', 'Otis', 'charge', 'not', 'farmer', 'first', 'how', 'critters', 'really', 'obvious', 'similarities', 'LION', 'KING', 'also', 'felt', 'watching', 'BARNYARD', 'seemed', 'water-downed', 'cruder', 'version', 'JIMMY', 'NEUTRON', 'watching', 'extras', 'DVD', 'learned', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'director', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'wrote', 'JIMMY', 'NEUTRON', 'movie', 'JIMMY', 'NEUTRON', 'BARNYARD', 'going', 'be', 'new', 'series', 'Nickleodeon', 'Fall', '2007.Besides', 'distraction', 'male', 'cows', 'udders', 'BARNYARD', 'pretty', 'funny', 'cartoon', 'film', 'most', 'original', 'thing', 'film', 'are', 'antics', 'animals', 'do', 'when', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'present', 'walking', 'around', 'ordering', 'pizza', 'throwing', 'parties', 'boy-tipping', 'driving', 'cars', 'etc', 'Even', 'idea', ""n't"", 'new', 'done', 'creatively', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'laughed', 'few', 'times', 'especially', 'nighttime', 'barnyard', 'party', 'scene.The', 'animation', 'clearly', 'directed', 'children', 'many', 'jokes', 'film', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'understood', 'older', 'children', 'adults', 'Children', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'film', 'animals', 'bright', 'colors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'much', 'humor', 'Nevertheless', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'overtly', 'suggestive', 'movie', 'can', 'overlook', 'udders', 'most', 'people', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'together.The', 'DVD', 'usual', 'filmmaker', 'commentary', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'none', 'ever', 'made', 'completed', 'production', 'phase', 'are', 'several', 'featurettes', 'including', 'Utter', 'Talent-Voices', 'BARNYARD', 'talks', 'most', 'featured', 'cast', 'members', 'Method', 'Acting', 'Kevin', 'James', 'short', 'James', 'learning', 'how', 'be', 'cow', 'real', 'live', 'cows', 'Animator', 'Life', 'people', 'who', 'made', 'BARNYARD', 'work', 'environment', 'are', 'two', 'music', 'videos', 'several', 'games', 'as', 'well', 'picture', 'pages']",N/A

Williams ""world traveller""","[7, 10]","One of the joys of having neices and nephews is that you have a perfectly good excuse to indulge in the guilty pleasure of seeing those animated features which would otherwise cause those around you to smirk when they overhear the movie for which you are buying a ticket. ""Hey! I got a kid here! Back off!""Fortunately, this is a movie we waited to watch after it had come out on DVD. What were these guys thinking? ""About as much sense as putting udders on a male cow (to borrow the previously mentioned anatomical oddity) would be the perfect summation of this movie.I don't suppose that it should surprise me that this movie was co-produced by Nickelodeon. In both style and substance, this movie is a step below most of what passes for Saturday morning cartoons these days - it certinaly is not in the same league with any of the other movies that I have enjoyed while sitting back with the kids and a big box of popcorn.This movie has none of the ""gee whiz"" animation or hilarious throwaway jokes to which I've been treated when escorting the neice and nephew to animated movies in the past. Forget comparisons to Disney, the Shrek movies or any of the Pixar classics. If one were to take Dreamworks merely average animated feature, ""Madagascar,"" amd strip it of visual sheen and sparkle, as well as its imagination and artistry, and you might end up with this rather clunky movie in which the main character - purportedly a male cow - looks more like a robotic plastic bear with udders. (I won't even go into how the baby calf born at the end of hte movie looks like a pig.)While this movie has more than a few amusing moments, those laughs don't make up for the embarressingly amateur storytelling. Any time the jokes stop in order to move along the narrative one has to wonder why they bothered.

Some of the jokes and references were to adult, like the Police officer filming cops, I don't think the reference to strip search was very family and definitely nothing that I would want a small child to pick up on.  And good grief, there were so many silly (and crude) phrases that i could here reapeated over and over again from a small kid, some that would be completely embaressing. And the fact that it show so much partying as being fun and acceptable (milk taking the place of alcohol), what kind of precidence does that set.  I fear meeting the 4 year old left to watch this movie over and over again. I just feel that this is that kind of a classic movie that I would put on without a thought for kids to watch, like dumbo, or bambi, or charlie brown christmas etc.That said, i did enjoy the movie overall. It did have a good underlying them of resposibility and loyalty, but again may be lost to a small child to the silly antics.

I'm not going into detail on his career, IMDB it, and you'll find the only quality film he's made is Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, and the quality of that is questionable to some.The celebrity voice-over has become somewhat of a fad in recent animated film creations, although it's constantly been proven that celebrity voices don't necessarily equal box-office draw, and they definitely don't equal quality cartoon time. Barnyard is no exception.The overall story is a subpar Lion King-esque ripoff with Sam Elliot as the patriarch of the barnyard and Kevin James as the young partying cow who doesn't take life seriously. Now follow the Lion King story, but replace Lions with cows, the prideland with a barnyard, and hyenas with coyotes. There you go, you've got this film.There are some funny parts, and a good deal of heart and family friendly lessons to be learned, but much of the father/son story drags on and gets so intense that it will leave kids bored and probably not register with them. Other things are just random and unfunny.Overall, this animated film feels vaguely familiar.
