It was filmed in the  1970's and won many awards. It is about a circuit riding preacher and his travels. God did many mighty things in his life. There is a book to go with this movie called The Man of the Wilderness something like that title anyway.,5,Christian Movie,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,333,"['SheffeyThis', 'just', 'wonderful', 'Christian', 'Movie', 'one', 'best', 'market', 'was', 'filmed', '1970', 'won', 'many', 'awards', 'circuit', 'riding', 'preacher', 'travels', 'God', 'did', 'many', 'mighty', 'things', 'life', 'book', 'go', 'movie', 'called', 'Man', 'Wilderness', 'something', 'title', 'anyway']",N/A

193158,AF5GJBN763Z7P,159166005X,Plain Servant,"[3, 3]","This is a good family movie that I welcome on my Bible shelf for all to see. I gave this review four stars because it left out so many important points of Sheffey's life. Sheffey did not like to read and he did not like to study, which accounts for many of his religious choices, but he was a man of great prayer, something rarely seen in today's Christian world. I like to show this movie to young adults to emphasize great prayer and great faith. I then followup with a Bible study on what a person is required to do to become a Christian, which was left out of the story so it would appeal to a broader audience.",4,Good movie,1314316800,"08 26, 2011",2011,615,"['good', 'family', 'movie', 'welcome', 'Bible', 'shelf', 'see', 'gave', 'review', 'four', 'stars', 'left', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'important', 'points', 'Sheffey', 'life', 'Sheffey', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'did', 'not', 'study', 'many', 'religious', 'choices', 'was', 'man', 'great', 'prayer', 'something', 'rarely', 'seen', 'today', 'Christian', 'world', 'like', 'show', 'movie', 'young', 'adults', 'emphasize', 'great', 'prayer', 'great', 'faith', 'then', 'followup', 'Bible', 'study', 'what', 'person', 'required', 'do', 'become', 'Christian', 'was', 'left', 'story', 'would', 'appeal', 'broader', 'audience']",N/A
193159,A2HSAMHE0MP3DD,159166005X,SW VA Gal,"[4, 4]","This is a fantastic movie.  Although it was released in 1977, you would not know from the movie. The casting is superb and the scenery is breathtaking in the Appalachian Mountains.  I originally saw this on a Christian movie channel about a month ago.  My church has a dinner and a movie special on Friday nights and we were discussing future movie ideas.  I suggested Sheffey and two others in the room said, ""Absolutely"".  They watched the movie at the same time I did.  We discussed some of the highlights of the movie with such passion that everyone insisted we watch it next.  My children were inspired from the movie and asked lots of thought provoking questions.  It is wonderful to spend quality time with family discussing Christian and family values, the enduring love of our Savior, and how all families and people are not perfect.  But while we all fall short, only through caring and loving individuals such as Sheffey, do we manage to get through this life on earth with promise.Sheffey is a man who makes it his life mission to help others.  He speaks (not really preaches) to anyone who will come to his tent revivals, to anyone along a trail, at someone's home, and even travels great distances by horse while old and sick to help those in need. This is a true story and extremely inspirational.  I highly recommend it for those who appreciate good Christian films.",5,Excellent family film,1254873600,"10 7, 2009",2009,1382,"['fantastic', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1977', 'would', 'not', 'know', 'movie', 'casting', 'superb', 'scenery', 'breathtaking', 'Appalachian', 'Mountains', 'originally', 'saw', 'Christian', 'movie', 'channel', 'month', 'ago', 'church', 'dinner', 'movie', 'special', 'Friday', 'nights', 'were', 'discussing', 'future', 'movie', 'ideas', 'suggested', 'Sheffey', 'two', 'others', 'room', 'said', 'Absolutely', 'watched', 'movie', 'same', 'time', 'did', 'discussed', 'highlights', 'movie', 'such', 'passion', 'everyone', 'insisted', 'watch', 'next', 'children', 'were', 'inspired', 'movie', 'asked', 'lots', 'thought', 'provoking', 'questions', 'wonderful', 'spend', 'quality', 'time', 'family', 'discussing', 'Christian', 'family', 'values', 'enduring', 'love', 'Savior', 'how', 'families', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'fall', 'short', 'only', 'caring', 'loving', 'individuals', 'such', 'Sheffey', 'do', 'manage', 'get', 'life', 'earth', 'promise.Sheffey', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'mission', 'help', 'others', 'not', 'really', 'preaches', 'anyone', 'who', 'will', 'come', 'tent', 'revivals', 'anyone', 'trail', 'someone', 'home', 'even', 'travels', 'great', 'distances', 'horse', 'old', 'sick', 'help', 'need', 'true', 'story', 'extremely', 'inspirational', 'highly', 'recommend', 'who', 'appreciate', 'good', 'Christian', 'films']",N/A
