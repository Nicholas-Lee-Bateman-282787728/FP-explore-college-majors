247111,A2J0MP2GPNHJHF,6301217926,"Claudio Di Gregorio ""ClauDG""","[0, 0]","It is a very entertaining film, surprisingly good considering it was an MTV movie. The score, though sentimental, is very effective and the period reconstruction is adequate.I do recommend this film, but there are a few minor problems.Time has affected the plot line in more ways than one: to a XXI century viewer, Jennie makes too much fuzz about her husband's pecadillo. This in itself is not a film flaw, but just a reflection on how well (or not) the argument has aged.The low budget of this MTV movie shows in a couple of moments. The paintings (supposedly by the character called David) are horrendous and they don't resemble Lindsay Wagner at all (but then, that often happens in Hollywood films; it seems studios never have one decent artist available. In this case, the &#8220;artist&#8221; was not billed, perhaps out of shame... :-)).During the interview with the shrink there is an audio problem, and later Ms. Wagner eye twitches when it shouldn't.Some of the actresses --Irene Tedrow (Mrs. Bates) and Constance McCashin (Beverly)-- were artificially reciting their lines. The four leads did a good job, though I can't shake off the sensation that Marc Singer sounded a little too pompous, dramatic and solemn (maybe it is just his voice is too resonant).But my main objection is that they could have cleaned up the resolution, which is unnecessarily messy. Several times, Jennie travels to the past physically (materially, in the flesh); it is unclear what, later, makes her to be both in the present and in the past. And a medallion acquires the ability to duplicate itself... (I won't say more not to spoil the viewing).Perhaps one shouldn't put too much logic on this genre, but to me it is unexplained what really happens at the ending, when --for the first time in the film-- events from the past seem to impact (and so decisively) in the present. Whether what happens with the pistol is what seems to have happened or it is not, it is hard to understand the very ending. Either way &#8211;whether the shot hits the target or misses it-- the conclusion is incongruous.",3,"Entertaining, nice & gentle.

As one who does a bit of re-enacting, the idea of time-traveling is an exciting thought. Of course, we all know that travel through time is impossible, at least in the way that the movies portray it. But re-enacting does give one the opportunity to experience the closest thing we have to time-traveling, and yet remain in the modern world as well.That's kind of like The Two Worlds of Jennie Logan. She can come and go through time as she pleases, and once she figures this out, she uses this ability to find the kind of life she's been longing for, including true love. (Many of the other reviews here have already given the synopsis of the story).A chick flick? Yeah...it is. But, it seems most guy flicks do not deal with this subject with the reverence that the chick flicks do, although there are excellent examples of what can be done to please both sexes when they put their mind to it, such as The Final Countdown (guy orientd, but my wife and my mother both love this movie), Frequency (not really time travel, per se, but still in that catagory), and Kate & Leopold (a movie for everyone!). The Two Worlds of Jennie Logan is closer to Somewhere In Time and The Love Letter when it comes to time-travel movies. There's a realistic quality to Jennie's reaction when she finds herself, at first unknowingly, transported to the past. We all feel her confusion and fright at her experience. But then, once she has realized what was happening and what she was able to do, she takes baby steps in her exploration of her portal to another time, pandora's box now opened.The movie plays out with a realistic tone, and the ending leaves the viewer without a sense of loss.

I was so happy to see that Amazon is making this film available ""on demand"". The DVD copy is crystal clear - even better than the original VHS copy.This TV movie is based on the novel Second Sight by David Williams. Jennie Logan (Lindsay Wagner) and her philandering husband Michael Logan (Alan Feinstein) are trying to make a new start by moving into a new house.In the attic Jennie finds an antique dress.  When she wears the dress, she is transported back to 1899 to the same house and surrounding area. There she finds the house is owned by David Reynolds (Marc Singer.) David believes when he sees Jennie in the dress, that he is really seeing his dead wife Pamela.When Jennie sees a portrait of herself in the dress in the local historical society, she begins to time travel more frequently and falls in love with David. Pamela's sister Elizabeth (Linda Gray of Dallas fame) has her own plans for David and does her best to break apart the time travel romance.Jennie's confidence grows as she continues to time travel and decides to make some tough choices about her marriage in the present and her relationship in 1899.What sacrifices will Jennie make to find her own happiness? And can Jennie save David's life when history threatens to repeat itself?Three decades later, this beautiful romance still haunts me.",5,Best TV Time Travel Romance Movie,1287187200,"10 16, 2010",2010,1397,"['1979', 'VHS', 'copy', 'wonderful', 'time', 'travel', 'romance', 'finally', 'dust', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'see', 'Amazon', 'making', 'film', 'available', 'demand', 'DVD', 'copy', 'crystal', 'clear', 'even', 'better', 'original', 'VHS', 'copy.This', 'TV', 'movie', 'based', 'novel', 'Second', 'Sight', 'David', 'Williams', 'Jennie', 'Logan', 'Lindsay', 'Wagner', 'philandering', 'husband', 'Michael', 'Logan', 'Alan', 'Feinstein', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'new', 'start', 'moving', 'new', 'house.In', 'attic', 'Jennie', 'antique', 'dress', 'When', 'dress', 'transported', 'back', '1899', 'same', 'house', 'surrounding', 'area', 'house', 'owned', 'David', 'Reynolds', 'Marc', 'Singer', 'David', 'when', 'Jennie', 'dress', 'really', 'seeing', 'dead', 'wife', 'Pamela.When', 'Jennie', 'portrait', 'herself', 'dress', 'local', 'historical', 'society', 'time', 'travel', 'more', 'frequently', 'love', 'David', 'Pamela', 'sister', 'Elizabeth', 'Linda', 'Gray', 'Dallas', 'fame', 'own', 'plans', 'David', 'best', 'break', 'apart', 'time', 'travel', 'romance.Jennie', 'confidence', 'time', 'travel', 'make', 'tough', 'choices', 'marriage', 'present', 'relationship', '1899.What', 'sacrifices', 'will', 'Jennie', 'make', 'find', 'own', 'happiness', 'can', 'Jennie', 'save', 'David', 'life', 'when', 'history', 'repeat', 'Three', 'decades', 'later', 'beautiful', 'romance', 'still']",N/A

247129,A1RR4A66NUYZBB,6301217926,LadyOwl,"[4, 4]","Based on the bestselling novel by David Williams, ""Second Sight"", the book being long out of print, and available only through a few private sellers charging over 100 dollars for it!!!As for the TV Movie, made in 1979, just months after the book was published, this cult classic has been long out of print, and thanks to the digital age, it has been resurrected on DVD.Brief Synopsis:Jennie Logan, devoted wife, although emotionally scarred by her husband's infidelity, remains by his side, albeit frigid, in all respects.They agree to purchase an old Victorian in rural New England, the house itself with over 100 years of memories. Memories that include Jennie herself.The house, a historical landmark, named aptly, the ""Reynolds House"", onced owned by artist David Reynolds, has a rich history, steeped in suspense, romance, with a dark cloud over the cause of David Reynold's unsolved murder.Jennie, herself a Victorian at heart, finds an authentic, Victorian white dress, intact for decades, under a protective cover, thick with dust, with one small ""flaw"" - a rip in shoulder of the fabric. She will soon discover that a rip in the fabric of time itself will be revealed as well, as she has the mysterious dress tailored, learning the tailor merely needed to stitch the tear, for the dress appears to have been tailored long, long ago...in her exact size.  Upon handing the very key to the portal of time and space, via the dress, back to her, Jennie, nonplussed at the time, goes home to try it on...Upon wearing the dress, and for good measure, she wraps her hair up in a ""Gibson"" Victorian upsweep, and looking at herself in the oval mirror, so eloquently silohuetted, a mysterious chill permeates the room, as the lights dim, and then, time returns things back to normal. With just one thing missing. Jennie herself.The mystical, and magical powers of the dress are soon revealed, as Jennie finds herself in the exact same place, but in a different time. A timespan of over 100 years!Jennie soon starts to realize that this ""Gift"" that has been bestowed upon her is no accident, as the story starts to unveil it's subplots, and twists. During her first ""episode"", Jennie finds herself still up in the attic, in the dress, yet the attic is now an artist's studio, complete with Victorian artifacts, the dusty old tapestries once folded up, back on the wall, in their splendid original glory. Upon hearing muffled sounds from below, she hears a woman scream, as a man's voice downstairs is yelling, ""Pamela! PAMELA!!!""A scream stuck in her own throat, she shuts her eyes, to open them again, finding herself back in the spot she was, in the present.All a dream, or something, she assumes...At the historical museum in the town, Jennie visits the curator, who is more than happy to prattle on about the infamous ""Reynolds House"", and it's mysterious, mystical legacy surrounding it. As Jennie becomes enraptured in the tale of David Reynolds, her hostess leads her to a room, and the conversation begins to take a sinsister turn...She shows Jennie a huge portrait of a woman. A woman, in the same Victorian updo, in the same white dress. Upon asking who the woman's name was, the hostess gleefully remembers, ""Let's see...oh, I remember! I believe her name was... Pamela!""As she half listens to her hostess, she studies the portrait, until it dawns on her, just who the woman is. And just as well, for the curator looks at her, and remarks, ""You look remarkably like her...Why...put you in that same white dress, with your hair up...is something wrong, dear? You're so pale...""",5,THE Classic Time Travel Love Story,1288051200,"10 26, 2010",2010,3584,"['Based', 'bestselling', 'novel', 'David', 'Williams', 'Second', 'Sight', 'book', 'being', 'long', 'print', 'available', 'only', 'few', 'private', 'sellers', 'charging', '100', 'dollars', 'TV', 'Movie', 'made', '1979', 'just', 'months', 'book', 'was', 'published', 'cult', 'classic', 'been', 'long', 'print', 'thanks', 'digital', 'age', 'been', 'resurrected', 'DVD.Brief', 'Synopsis', 'Jennie', 'Logan', 'devoted', 'wife', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'husband', 'infidelity', 'side', 'frigid', 'respects.They', 'agree', 'purchase', 'old', 'Victorian', 'rural', 'New', 'England', 'house', '100', 'years', 'memories', 'Memories', 'include', 'Jennie', 'herself.The', 'house', 'historical', 'landmark', 'named', 'aptly', 'Reynolds', 'House', 'onced', 'owned', 'artist', 'David', 'Reynolds', 'rich', 'history', 'steeped', 'suspense', 'romance', 'dark', 'cloud', 'cause', 'David', 'Reynold', 'unsolved', 'murder.Jennie', 'Victorian', 'heart', 'authentic', 'Victorian', 'white', 'dress', 'intact', 'decades', 'protective', 'cover', 'thick', 'dust', 'one', 'small', 'flaw', 'rip', 'shoulder', 'fabric', 'will', 'soon', 'discover', 'rip', 'fabric', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'as', 'well', 'mysterious', 'dress', 'tailored', 'learning', 'tailor', 'merely', 'needed', 'stitch', 'tear', 'dress', 'have', 'been', 'tailored', 'long', 'long', 'ago', 'exact', 'size', 'handing', 'very', 'key', 'portal', 'time', 'space', 'dress', 'back', 'Jennie', 'nonplussed', 'time', 'home', 'try', 'wearing', 'dress', 'good', 'measure', 'wraps', 'hair', 'up', 'Gibson', 'Victorian', 'upsweep', 'looking', 'oval', 'mirror', 'so', 'eloquently', 'silohuetted', 'mysterious', 'chill', 'room', 'lights', 'dim', 'then', 'time', 'returns', 'things', 'back', 'normal', 'just', 'one', 'thing', 'missing', 'Jennie', 'herself.The', 'mystical', 'magical', 'powers', 'dress', 'are', 'soon', 'revealed', 'Jennie', 'exact', 'same', 'place', 'different', 'time', 'timespan', '100', 'years', 'Jennie', 'soon', 'realize', 'Gift', 'been', 'bestowed', 'accident', 'story', 'unveil', 'subplots', 'twists', 'first', 'episode', 'Jennie', 'still', 'up', 'attic', 'dress', 'attic', 'now', 'artist', 'studio', 'complete', 'Victorian', 'artifacts', 'dusty', 'old', 'tapestries', 'once', 'folded', 'up', 'back', 'wall', 'splendid', 'original', 'glory', 'hearing', 'muffled', 'sounds', 'woman', 'scream', 'man', 'voice', 'downstairs', 'yelling', 'Pamela', 'PAMELA', 'scream', 'stuck', 'own', 'throat', 'eyes', 'open', 'again', 'finding', 'back', 'spot', 'was', 'present.All', 'dream', 'something', 'historical', 'museum', 'town', 'Jennie', 'curator', 'who', 'more', 'happy', 'prattle', 'infamous', 'Reynolds', 'House', 'mysterious', 'mystical', 'legacy', 'surrounding', 'Jennie', 'enraptured', 'tale', 'David', 'Reynolds', 'hostess', 'room', 'conversation', 'take', 'sinsister', 'turn', 'Jennie', 'huge', 'portrait', 'woman', 'woman', 'same', 'Victorian', 'updo', 'same', 'white', 'dress', 'asking', 'who', 'woman', 'name', 'was', 'hostess', 'gleefully', 'remembers', 'Let', 'see', 'oh', 'remember', 'believe', 'name', 'was', 'Pamela', 'listens', 'hostess', 'studies', 'portrait', 'just', 'who', 'woman', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'curator', 'remarks', 'look', 'remarkably', 'Why', 'put', 'same', 'white', 'dress', 'hair', 'up', 'something', 'wrong', 'dear', ""'re"", 'so', 'pale']",N/A

The VHS copies music is winey and not all that clear and sharp.These are ""made on demand"" and many people have complained about poor quality.  If you receive one of these, it is important to contact the seller right away so they can send you a new one.  Sometimes, even MGM - made on demand - may pass out a lemon.  Not on purpose.

247142,A245SULJZNLHLD,6301217926,richievee,"[1, 1]","READ WITH CAUTION: SPOILERS BELOW!I agree with many other reviewers, who liken this fine movie to ""Somewhere in Time."" It has that same feel to it, though much more firmly rooted in the present. The passages from present to past and back again are nicely handled, so there is no confusion about where Jennie is at any given moment -- unless, as on a couple of occasions, the director chooses to keep that a secret momentarily.My main reservation about the movie is that the acting is, for the most part, only passable. I sensed that the filming was rushed a bit and that a theatrical release would have used more takes to good advantage. Often, the actors seemed merely to be reciting memorized lines. Not too badly, mind you, but not entirely convincing either. Irene Tedrow (Mrs. Bates) was particularly guilty of that. Alan Feinstein (Michael) and Lindsay Wagner (Jennie) also let their acting techniques show rather too conspicuously here and there. Marc Singer (David Reynolds) was strong throughout.The spoiler, referred to above, is because I must comment on one regrettable close-up of Jennie. She lies dead on her bed in the attic, and Lindsay Wagner's closed left eye clearly twitches. That shot should have been retaken. But then the ending comes about, and it is marvelous. The idea for hidden paintings (all showing the pendant Michael gave her) is truly inspired, and Alan Feinstein really nails this difficult scene -- a sweet combination of crying and smiling that is utterly human!",5,"Not Perfect, But Still a Great Film!",1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,1498,"['READ', 'WITH', 'CAUTION', 'SPOILERS', 'agree', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'liken', 'fine', 'movie', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'same', 'feel', 'though', 'much', 'more', 'firmly', 'rooted', 'present', 'passages', 'present', 'past', 'back', 'again', 'are', 'nicely', 'handled', 'confusion', 'where', 'Jennie', 'given', 'moment', 'couple', 'occasions', 'director', 'keep', 'secret', 'momentarily.My', 'main', 'reservation', 'movie', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'only', 'passable', 'sensed', 'filming', 'was', 'rushed', 'bit', 'theatrical', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'good', 'advantage', 'Often', 'actors', 'seemed', 'merely', 'be', 'reciting', 'memorized', 'lines', 'Not', 'too', 'badly', 'mind', 'not', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'Irene', 'Tedrow', 'Mrs.', 'Bates', 'was', 'particularly', 'guilty', 'Alan', 'Feinstein', 'Michael', 'Lindsay', 'Wagner', 'Jennie', 'also', 'let', 'acting', 'techniques', 'show', 'rather', 'too', 'conspicuously', 'here', 'there', 'Marc', 'Singer', 'David', 'Reynolds', 'was', 'strong', 'throughout.The', 'spoiler', 'referred', 'above', 'must', 'comment', 'one', 'regrettable', 'close-up', 'Jennie', 'dead', 'bed', 'attic', 'Lindsay', 'Wagner', 'closed', 'left', 'eye', 'clearly', 'twitches', 'shot', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'retaken', 'then', 'ending', 'about', 'marvelous', 'idea', 'hidden', 'paintings', 'showing', 'pendant', 'Michael', 'gave', 'truly', 'inspired', 'Alan', 'Feinstein', 'really', 'difficult', 'scene', 'sweet', 'combination', 'crying', 'smiling', 'utterly', 'human']",N/A

247148,A446PJ96JQX4X,6301217926,Sonya@Hollywood,"[1, 1]","When Jennie Logan and her husband move to the country, they acquire a Victorian house with a mysterious past.  Jennie's unfaithful husband desperately wants a fresh start and tries to rebuild their marriage. Jennie, played by Lindsay Wagner finds  a beautiful dress in the attic from the turn of the century. She repairs the small tear on the shoulder and puts it on, taking her to the year 1899. Soon Jennie realizes every time she wears the dress, she experiences a physical reaction and it transports her to the past.  She meets David Reynolds, an artist and widower who to her surprise, occupies the same house where she now lives. The haunting soundtrack by Glenn Paxton is perfect as  Jennie goes back and forth between two worlds.  She explains her episodes to her husband who thinks she is having delusions and is punishing him for his infidelity.  At first, even Jennie questions her mental status and sees a psychiatrist.  But As Jennie travels more frequently to the past, she discovers she is falling in love with David.  She also learns that David's father-in-law blames him for his daughter's death and threatens to kill him. To thicken the plot, David's sister-in-law played by Linda Gray is in love with him and can't seem to stay away.  Jennie learns of the history of the house and of a duel between David and his father-in-law that took place at the turn of the century celebration.  Can Jennie rewrite history and save him? I first saw ""The two Worlds of Jennie Logan"" on television when it was released in 1979 and it left an incredible impression as it was one of the first films to address the theme of time travel. This film made for television based on David L.
