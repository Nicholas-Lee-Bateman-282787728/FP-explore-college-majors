This is a flawlessly paced, gripping series, with real dramatic heft, fabulous acting and top-notch production values. As with the first season, the ""big story"" uncovered by the journalists of The Hour seems a bit over the top, but any criticisms I can muster are really just minor quibbles in the face of what is a first-rate dramatic series. I particularly enjoyed some of the side stories, such as the exploration of the inner lives of older characters such as Lix, and the final episode was a real doozy.

1602721,A2BDZAU0Y4J6NB,B009VXWIDY,F. S. L'hoir,"[2, 3]","I looked forward eagerly to Season Two of ""The Hour"", the first season of which I found absolutely riveting, watching it from beginning to end, and then re-watching it.Although I found series two, which explores the politics of fear in the international race for the bomb, absorbing, I didn't think that the scenario was as tightly constructed as that of series one--perhaps too many subplots suggested, but because of the constraints of a six-part series, left unexplored.As with the first series, the characters are well developed. The acting, in fact, is is flawless, particularly Peter Capaldi, the director of programming who replaced Anton Lesser (whose character is presumably being detained at Her Majesty's pleasure) and Anna Chancellor, who plays the cynical Lix, and this series reveals one of the reasons behind her chain-smoking cynicism.The second series explores the troubled relationship between news anchor Hector and his unhappy wife. Dominic West manages to temper Hector's overweening ego with the vulnerability of a little boy lost, eventually rediscovering his long-buried generosity of spirit. Vincent Riotta displays a subtle menace as the owner of a trendy Soho night club (the elegance of which cannot quite hide its seediness), and we discover that there is more to Westminster spin doctor (to apply a term unknown in the 50s) Angus McCain--Julian Rhind-Tutt--than he would prefer the public to know. Hannah Tointon is convincing and moving in her role as a showgirl whose aspirations to climb the social ladder seem likely to be doomed, and the ensemble cast of the 'Hour Team' gives us an impression that we are 'backstage' at a working BBC production.Romola Garai and Ben Whishaw continue their persuasive portrayals of the brilliant-but-lonely career-driven television journalists, Bel and Freddy, but I am less convinced of the chemistry that supposedly draws them together as a couple, but perhaps that is the point. They are drawn together by their mutual devotion to pursuing the story hell-or-high water and perhaps each represents the only one who could possibly fulfil the emotional needs of the other (I also thought that the charming actress playing Freddy's wife was wasted in a thankless role, since that subplot seemed undeveloped and became quickly buried under the main issue).Nevertheless, series two still had me wanting to know what was going to happen next, and I fervently hope that there will be a series three.",4,Well Worth Watching,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,2462,"['looked', 'forward', 'eagerly', 'Season', 'Two', 'Hour', 'first', 'season', 'found', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'watching', 'beginning', 'end', 'then', 're-watching', 'it.Although', 'found', 'series', 'two', 'politics', 'fear', 'international', 'race', 'bomb', 'absorbing', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'scenario', 'was', 'tightly', 'constructed', 'series', 'one', 'perhaps', 'too', 'many', 'subplots', 'suggested', 'constraints', 'six-part', 'series', 'left', 'unexplored.As', 'first', 'series', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'developed', 'acting', 'fact', 'flawless', 'particularly', 'Peter', 'Capaldi', 'director', 'programming', 'who', 'replaced', 'Anton', 'Lesser', 'character', 'presumably', 'being', 'detained', 'Her', 'Majesty', 'pleasure', 'Anna', 'Chancellor', 'who', 'cynical', 'Lix', 'series', 'one', 'reasons', 'chain-smoking', 'cynicism.The', 'second', 'series', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'news', 'anchor', 'Hector', 'unhappy', 'wife', 'Dominic', 'West', 'temper', 'Hector', 'overweening', 'ego', 'vulnerability', 'little', 'boy', 'lost', 'eventually', 'rediscovering', 'long-buried', 'generosity', 'spirit', 'Vincent', 'Riotta', 'subtle', 'menace', 'owner', 'trendy', 'Soho', 'night', 'club', 'elegance', 'can', 'not', 'quite', 'hide', 'seediness', 'discover', 'more', 'Westminster', 'spin', 'doctor', 'apply', 'term', 'unknown', '50s', 'Angus', 'McCain', 'Julian', 'Rhind-Tutt', 'would', 'prefer', 'public', 'know', 'Hannah', 'Tointon', 'convincing', 'moving', 'role', 'showgirl', 'aspirations', 'climb', 'social', 'ladder', 'seem', 'likely', 'be', 'doomed', 'ensemble', 'cast', ""'Hour"", 'Team', 'impression', 'are', ""'backstage"", 'working', 'BBC', 'production.Romola', 'Garai', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'continue', 'persuasive', 'portrayals', 'brilliant-but-lonely', 'career-driven', 'television', 'journalists', 'Bel', 'Freddy', 'am', 'less', 'convinced', 'chemistry', 'supposedly', 'together', 'couple', 'perhaps', 'point', 'are', 'drawn', 'together', 'mutual', 'devotion', 'pursuing', 'story', 'hell-or-high', 'water', 'perhaps', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'could', 'possibly', 'fulfil', 'emotional', 'needs', 'other', 'also', 'thought', 'charming', 'actress', 'playing', 'Freddy', 'wife', 'was', 'wasted', 'thankless', 'role', 'subplot', 'seemed', 'undeveloped', 'became', 'quickly', 'buried', 'main', 'issue', '.Nevertheless', 'series', 'two', 'still', 'had', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'fervently', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'series', 'three']",N/A
1602722,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B009VXWIDY,K. Boullosa,"[1, 2]","I can only add my enthusiastic views to the others expressed here.  This is a wonderful show, beautifully produced, well-written for adults (emphasis on that last), witty, engrossing, and leaves the viewer with fingers crossed for a Season 3.The focal point of the story is ""The Hour"", the first 60-Minute type news show in Britain in the still somewhat grey, grim post-WWII years - newsreels are going out of style and the BBC is looking for an intriguing new format.  ""The Hour"" is what they come up with, and it is also notable for being the first news show produced by a woman (Bel Rowley, played by Romola Garai).  What gives the show its intellectual heft is the way actual news stories of the era (for example, the 1956 Suez and Hungarian revolt crises) are utilized to bring out different aspects of the characters and to highlight their values and attitudes.The central characters were all introduced in Season One: the beleaguered Bel, out to prove that a woman can do it and do it well; Hector Madden, the hunky, handsome face of the show (Dominic West), struggling with terrible war memories, a difficult marriage, and his fierce attraction to Bel; and Ben Lyon, the passionate, intellectual, left-wing journalist who will stop at nothing to get a good story, also cherishing unresolved feelings toward Bel, who is equally confused about her feelings for him.The stories also tell us a great deal about post-war Britain: the rise of immigration of people of color from Britain's former colonies uncovers blossoming racism; sexual scandals rise to the highest political levels (shades of the Profumo scandal!); MI6 appears to be involved in the cover-up of several murders, including that of the young daughter of the socially prominent Lord Elms; Downing Street exerts pressure on the network to slant or suppress stories.Through the interrelationships of the cast to each other and through their vehemently held views on the news stories that ""The Hour"" focuses upon and how to handle them, the program brings us very vivid characterizations.  As dialogue around Britain's still rigid class system, among other issues, develops, we can begin to see some of the trends that would eventually lead Britain into its next era, the Swingin' Sixties.  The beauty of the show is that all of these themes are seamlessly woven together, the historical and the personal.In Season Two, Peter Capaldi, one of this reviewer's very favorite British (he is Scottish) character actors, joins the cast as the new head of the unit producing the show.  He shares a past with series regular Anna Chancellor, the older, seasoned, and slightly embittered senior woman on the staff.Season Two follows most closely the political and law enforcement scandals emanating from a seedy nightclub, the Paradis, whose owner does not take interference lightly.  Tension builds throughout the episodes as we wonder just how much the staff of ""The Hour"" is willing to risk to expose, and by doing so bring down, senior members of the Metropolitan Police Force and the government.  Season Two ends on a true cliff-hanger event, and if there is no Season 3, there are going to be very many angry and disappointed viewers.This is really entertainment for grownups - the writing does not  (although there is no profanity) pull any punches, and as someone else has pointed out, when ""The Hour"" was aired in the US on BBC America, it had to be edited to fit in commercials.  The DVD does not have those commercials, and therefore has in it the footage that did not make it on the air here.Very, very highly recommended!",4,Great Writing - Great Performances = Great Television,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,3591,"['can', 'only', 'add', 'enthusiastic', 'views', 'others', 'expressed', 'here', 'wonderful', 'show', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'well-written', 'adults', 'emphasis', 'last', 'witty', 'engrossing', 'viewer', 'fingers', 'crossed', 'Season', '3.The', 'focal', 'point', 'story', 'Hour', 'first', '60-Minute', 'type', 'news', 'show', 'Britain', 'still', 'somewhat', 'grey', 'grim', 'post-WWII', 'years', 'newsreels', 'are', 'going', 'style', 'BBC', 'looking', 'intriguing', 'new', 'format', 'Hour', 'what', 'come', 'up', 'also', 'notable', 'being', 'first', 'news', 'show', 'produced', 'woman', 'Bel', 'Rowley', 'played', 'Romola', 'Garai', 'What', 'show', 'intellectual', 'heft', 'way', 'actual', 'news', 'stories', 'era', 'example', '1956', 'Suez', 'Hungarian', 'revolt', 'crises', 'are', 'utilized', 'bring', 'out', 'different', 'aspects', 'characters', 'highlight', 'values', 'attitudes.The', 'central', 'characters', 'were', 'introduced', 'Season', 'One', 'beleaguered', 'Bel', 'prove', 'woman', 'can', 'do', 'do', 'well', 'Hector', 'Madden', 'hunky', 'handsome', 'face', 'show', 'Dominic', 'West', 'struggling', 'terrible', 'war', 'memories', 'difficult', 'marriage', 'fierce', 'attraction', 'Bel', 'Ben', 'Lyon', 'passionate', 'intellectual', 'left-wing', 'journalist', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'get', 'good', 'story', 'also', 'cherishing', 'unresolved', 'feelings', 'Bel', 'who', 'equally', 'confused', 'feelings', 'him.The', 'stories', 'also', 'tell', 'great', 'deal', 'post-war', 'Britain', 'rise', 'immigration', 'people', 'color', 'Britain', 'former', 'colonies', 'uncovers', 'blossoming', 'racism', 'sexual', 'scandals', 'rise', 'highest', 'political', 'levels', 'shades', 'Profumo', 'scandal', 'MI6', 'be', 'involved', 'cover-up', 'several', 'murders', 'including', 'young', 'daughter', 'socially', 'prominent', 'Lord', 'Elms', 'Downing', 'Street', 'pressure', 'network', 'slant', 'suppress', 'interrelationships', 'cast', 'other', 'vehemently', 'held', 'views', 'news', 'Hour', 'upon', 'how', 'handle', 'program', 'very', 'vivid', 'characterizations', 'dialogue', 'Britain', 'still', 'rigid', 'class', 'system', 'other', 'issues', 'develops', 'can', 'begin', 'see', 'trends', 'would', 'eventually', 'lead', 'Britain', 'next', 'era', 'Swingin', 'Sixties', 'beauty', 'show', 'themes', 'are', 'seamlessly', 'woven', 'together', 'historical', 'personal.In', 'Season', 'Two', 'Peter', 'Capaldi', 'one', 'reviewer', 'very', 'favorite', 'British', 'Scottish', 'character', 'actors', 'cast', 'new', 'head', 'unit', 'producing', 'show', 'shares', 'past', 'series', 'regular', 'Anna', 'Chancellor', 'older', 'seasoned', 'slightly', 'embittered', 'senior', 'woman', 'staff.Season', 'Two', 'most', 'closely', 'political', 'law', 'enforcement', 'scandals', 'emanating', 'seedy', 'nightclub', 'Paradis', 'owner', 'not', 'take', 'interference', 'lightly', 'Tension', 'episodes', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'staff', 'Hour', 'willing', 'risk', 'expose', 'doing', 'so', 'bring', 'down', 'senior', 'members', 'Metropolitan', 'Police', 'Force', 'government', 'Season', 'Two', 'ends', 'true', 'cliff-hanger', 'event', 'Season', '3', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'very', 'many', 'angry', 'disappointed', 'viewers.This', 'really', 'entertainment', 'grownups', 'writing', 'not', 'profanity', 'punches', 'someone', 'else', 'pointed', 'out', 'when', 'Hour', 'was', 'aired', 'US', 'BBC', 'America', 'had', 'be', 'edited', 'fit', 'commercials', 'DVD', 'not', 'have', 'commercials', 'therefore', 'footage', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'air', 'here.Very', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A
1602723,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B009VXWIDY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 6]","When the BBC period drama ""The Hour"" premiered on American TV last year, critics were quick to draw comparisons to AMC's ""Mad Men."" While both shows might appeal to the same adult demographic, however, I never really gave much credence to this categorization. In fact, the two shows have little in common aside from being period piece dramas bolstered by an easy social atmosphere of drinking and smoking. While there is plenty of workplace intrigue inherent in both shows, Season One of ""The Hour"" also mixed in a fair share of government espionage. It introduced us to the birth of a TV newsmagazine show called The Hour (how appropriate) as it struggled to find its footing. With the six new episodes of Season Two, The Hour is battling to remain relevant in an increasingly competitive TV market (a timely subject that never seems to go out of style). Principle story threads include a nefarious local business man, a honey pot scandal, police corruption, racial unrest, as well as unexpected office romances and personal secrets revealed.At the heart of ""The Hour,"" Romola Garai continues to impress as a headstrong producer who is not afraid to make difficult choices for the program's integrity. Dominic West, as the host, is now a full-fledged celebrity stepping out to fashionable nightspots and receiving copious amounts of media scrutiny. And back on the scene is investigative reporter Ben Whishaw, who returns to The Hour with a new role and a pretty big personal surprise for Garai. Their unrequited love affair (or is it just a friendship?) gets quite a bit of play in these six episodes. When a dancer at a local club meets with an act of violence, West becomes an immediate suspect. This, however, is just a catalyst that introduces the viewer to a criminal enterprise whose repercussions and reach extend further than anyone might anticipate. Fully embroiled in the scandal, will The Hour team be able to uncover the full extent of the local corruption that involves blackmail, brutality and even murder?""The Hour"" continues to be what I'd call a slow burn. It is for patient adult audiences and unravels at the pace of a good novel. In truth, while the show is always an easy recommendation, I felt this season was a bit more uneven than the first. I loved both the beginning and the end episodes, but some of the central segments seemed a little overstuffed with personal drama. A marriage in crisis, a child given up for adoption, an alluring new job offer, new love interests: I just wasn't as invested in every tangent as I might have hoped. One thing that I really liked, however, was West's wife played by Oona Chaplin (she's the granddaughter of Charlie Chaplin). West and Chaplin go on quite a ride this year, and Chaplin steps out of the shadows to demand and command a newfound independence and respect.In the end, the final resolutions of the season feel a bit rushed. Five episodes of methodically paced intrigue get wrapped up in about 30 minutes of fast paced action in the concluding moments. And fair warning, a cliffhanger might leave you in the grips of frustration! Overall, a solid season that still manages to impress from both a technical standpoint (sets, costumes, music) and with a number of strong performances. The sole DVD/Blu-ray extra are some Behind-the-Scene spots. If you watched the show on BBCAmerica, they will likely be familiar to you as portions of them aired on commercial breaks. They are nice enough if you are a fan.

It's much more of a thriller than a mystery (after the first two episodes, anyway). It involves the culture of celebrity and domestic corruption much more than superpower politics. Most significantly, the plot has much more to do with Hector and Marnie Madden than Freddie and Bel. Oona Chaplin steals the show almost as much as Ben Whishaw and Anna Chancellor did in season 1, and Dominic West gets some great scenes playing off of her (his final scene with her in episode 6 is striking and memorable, and his best work so far in this program).The ending of season 2 is much more tense and scary than anything in season 1. There's nothing in this season as inexplicable as the suicide of Thomas Kish in season 1. It holds together pretty well.I can't discuss the weak points without giving away much of the plot.

That would be unfair, and I'm hoping others don't give too much away. I will say that I loved the first season of the wonderful BBC series when I reviewed it last year. It had been a while since I saw it and I guess I expected a ""recap"" or ""Previously on..."" section at the beginning. There isn't any (and no, I don't consider THAT info a ""spoiler""). So it'll take even the fans of Season One to get acclimated - only about 10 minutes. But if you haven't seen Season One here is an alert: WATCH THAT ONE FIRST! It will set up the main characters for you and you'll enjoy the story of the BBC news show ""The Hour"" and how it breaks the big stories as it fights with the station's Board of Directors. (This is non-commercial TV so no need to fight with sponsors.)The second season is somewhat different that the first because it's more of a mystery involving famous people who frequent a nightclub. Throughout the approximately six hours of the series (Ironically each episode of ""The Hour"" clocks in at 61 minutes!) the subjects  covered are  Nuclear War in the 50s - the period during which the show takes place - Immigration quotas , crooked politicans,  the pornography trade and gay rights. (Note that I said this takes place during President Eisenhower's second term. Yet, don't we have those problems today? No this isn't a spoiler either but look for a reference to a quote from Abraham Lincoln (a hot film in theaters as I write this).The cast is great - every one of them.  Before The Hour 1, I only knew of Ben Whishaw (Freddy) but another name on the opening credits caught my eye too: Oona Chaplin - who, though not listed on either the front or back of the BD case, has a major role as the wife of the head news reader on the show. This is of course the great Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter (named after his wife) and the daughter of actress Geraldine Chaplin.The BD (and I'm pretty sure the DVD - hasone bonus. It's a 12-minute ""behind the scenes"" featurette where we get to see the cast, producers, and costumer as they basically describe the plot. I warn you. Do not skip to this until you have watched the full six hours. There are way too many ""spoilers"" included there.To my knowledge they have not started filming The Hour 3 - or maybe haven't even started to write the script but, as a few others who posted reviews here - based on the TV airing on BBC America - I will certainly be waiting when Season 3 comes out on DVD or Bluray.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,"The second season is just as well written, as just as exciting with some new secrets revealed (but no spoilers from me.)",1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,2608,"['do', ""n't"", 'come', 'review', 'expecting', 'find', 'spoliers', 'would', 'be', 'unfair', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'will', 'say', 'loved', 'first', 'season', 'wonderful', 'BBC', 'series', 'when', 'reviewed', 'last', 'year', 'had', 'been', 'while', 'saw', 'guess', 'expected', 'recap', 'Previously', 'section', 'beginning', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'THAT', 'spoiler', ""'ll"", 'take', 'even', 'fans', 'Season', 'One', 'get', 'acclimated', 'only', '10', 'minutes', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Season', 'One', 'here', 'alert', 'WATCH', 'ONE', 'FIRST', 'will', 'set', 'up', 'main', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'story', 'BBC', 'news', 'show', 'Hour', 'how', 'big', 'stories', 'station', 'Board', 'Directors', 'non-commercial', 'TV', 'need', 'fight', 'sponsors', 'second', 'season', 'somewhat', 'different', 'first', 'more', 'mystery', 'involving', 'famous', 'people', 'who', 'frequent', 'nightclub', 'approximately', 'six', 'hours', 'series', 'Ironically', 'episode', 'Hour', 'clocks', '61', 'minutes', 'subjects', 'covered', 'are', 'Nuclear', 'War', '50s', 'period', 'show', 'place', 'Immigration', 'quotas', 'crooked', 'politicans', 'pornography', 'trade', 'gay', 'rights', 'Note', 'said', 'place', 'President', 'Eisenhower', 'second', 'term', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'today', 'No', ""n't"", 'spoiler', 'look', 'reference', 'quote', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'hot', 'film', 'theaters', 'write', '.The', 'cast', 'great', 'one', 'Hour', '1', 'only', 'knew', 'Ben', 'Whishaw', 'Freddy', 'name', 'opening', 'credits', 'caught', 'eye', 'too', 'Oona', 'Chaplin', 'who', 'not', 'listed', 'front', 'back', 'BD', 'case', 'major', 'role', 'wife', 'head', 'news', 'reader', 'show', 'course', 'great', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'granddaughter', 'named', 'wife', 'daughter', 'actress', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplin.The', 'BD', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'DVD', 'hasone', 'bonus', '12-minute', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'cast', 'producers', 'costumer', 'basically', 'describe', 'plot', 'warn', 'Do', 'not', 'skip', 'have', 'watched', 'full', 'six', 'hours', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'included', 'there.To', 'knowledge', 'have', 'not', 'started', 'filming', 'Hour', '3', 'maybe', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'started', 'write', 'script', 'few', 'others', 'who', 'posted', 'reviews', 'here', 'based', 'TV', 'airing', 'BBC', 'America', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'waiting', 'when', 'Season', '3', 'out', 'DVD', 'Bluray.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

As the story unfolds, unpleasantness expands and blossoms. Hints dropped at the early stages are elaborated upon with minimal subtlety. British ruling classes are genetically defective, grossly oppressive and much given to duplicity, childishness, treason, severe sexual problems and extreme repression of personal feelings. The Government consists of sleazy liars. The police is brutal and corrupt. Men are immature, deviants and alcoholic.  Women are strong, with sound values and routinely mistreated by men who do not deserve them.  Immigrants are good, thoroughly imbued with the pursuit of a better democracy, and marginalized by fascists.
