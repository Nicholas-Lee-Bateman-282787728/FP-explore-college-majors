He recognizes augers, excavators, rollers, and back-hoes from trucks and tractors. Bob the Builder seemed a natural ""vehicle"" for him to see what those machines do. ""On Site: Skyscrapers"" shows real construction of a skyscraper from drafting plans to assembling beams to pouring and finishing concrete. It shows the use of equipment, elevators, cranes. At a level children can understand, this episode teaches the value of planning, following a plan, and cooperating to work (or play) together. My grandson watched it to completion and we talked about it as we watched it. It might have helped that I bought him a  Deluxe Child Construction Costume Hard Hat Toy Helmet from Block Buster Costumes through Amazon. It has an adjustable inner lining.",5,Bob the Builder does not talk down to kids,1353542400,"11 22, 2012",2012,853,"['three-year-old', 'grandson', 'loves', 'see', 'heavy', 'equipment', 'tractors', 'pajamas', 'sheets', 'augers', 'excavators', 'rollers', 'back-hoes', 'trucks', 'tractors', 'Builder', 'seemed', 'natural', 'vehicle', 'see', 'what', 'machines', 'do', 'Site', 'Skyscrapers', 'shows', 'real', 'construction', 'skyscraper', 'drafting', 'plans', 'assembling', 'beams', 'pouring', 'finishing', 'concrete', 'use', 'equipment', 'elevators', 'cranes', 'level', 'children', 'can', 'understand', 'episode', 'value', 'planning', 'following', 'plan', 'cooperating', 'work', 'play', 'together', 'grandson', 'watched', 'completion', 'talked', 'about', 'watched', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'bought', 'Deluxe', 'Child', 'Construction', 'Costume', 'Hard', 'Hat', 'Toy', 'Helmet', 'Block', 'Buster', 'Costumes', 'Amazon', 'adjustable', 'inner', 'lining']",Bob the Builder - On Site: Skyscrapers
