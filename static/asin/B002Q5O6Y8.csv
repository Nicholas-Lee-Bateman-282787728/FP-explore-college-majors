This documentary provides a detailed social and political synopsis of the greed and corruption that ultimately produced the Great Depression.  It also makes obvious the parallels between the 1929 and 2008 crashes: (1) the back-room dealings of the uber-wealthy, (2) the unjustified exuberance fueled by the myth of never-ending growth,  (3) the false prosperity based upon debt, (4) the absence of federal regulation, and (5) the complete lack of financial transparency.Then as now, market manipulations and pseudo-transactions resulted in privatized gains, but socialized losses -- the ultimate corporate welfare where the tax-paying citizen becomes the lender of last resort.  Sadly, the masses continue to embrace the fantasy of their God-given right to become billionaires...  even at the expense of the national well-being. As Justice Louis Brandeis once remarked, ""We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.""",5,1929 & 2008...

That was the lead-up to the stock market crash of 1929.The DVD focuses on the year 1929 and some of the men who were leaders in the securities field such as William Durant, founder of GM, Charles Mitchell, the man who popularized stock ownership for the ""little guy"" and Jesse Livermore, a veteran Wall Street technician.The DVD does a good job of relating the spirit of the times and the optimistic attitude of Americans during the ""Roaring 20's"" when Americans came to believe in permanent prosperity. It seemed everyone expected to be able to ""strike it rich"" and the Stock Market was only one of the disasters in the 20's - the other being the Florida real estate bubble.There is the usual recounting of the issues involved: easy credit, buying on margin, valuations that had nothing to do with the actual profitability of companies, the rigged game played by the big money interests. What surprised this viewer the most is that everyone knew it was - at least to some extent - a rigged game that the ""little guy"" really couldn't win! And yet, they kept coming back for more! It seemed that everyone was seeking a way to ""get rich quick"" and, even though they knew the market was a racket, they kept hoping for that one big score!I think the video did a good job of relating the attitudes of the day, spotlighting some of Wall Street's leading speculators, and giving a good recounting of the events that led up to ""Black Thursday"" and the following days that were ""The Crash"". I don't think it did as good a job of linking the crash to the acceptance by Americans of easy credit and indebtedness or events in Europe that actually precipitated the crash and following depression.In conclusion, I think this DVD does a good job of presenting the events that led up to the crash as well as the crash itself.

However, years ago, I google ""Why did the market crash in 1929?"" and didn't get a clear answer.  This documentary helped me to make sense of it, or to revive what little I remember from American history classes.Teachers may love showing this because it proves the clich'e ""the more things change.""  Our current economic downturn is often spoken of in the same breath as the Great Depression and this doc explains why.  Like in this decade, the 1920s had wreckless businesspeople and lax governmental regulations.  Like now, folk were told to invest in stock that eventually did not pan out.  They showed that some stock buyers would consult an astrologist; this reminded me of the Beanie Baby craze of the 1990s.  This work showed the rich surviving bad things and the poor people getting majorly cheated.The very last image here is important: it showed people celebrating New Year's 1930.  The point was to say that the depression didn't happen overnight, but ""the party was over.""  Viewers who want to learn about the Great Depression should look elsewhere; this documentary was solely about the champagne days of the 1920s.  It showed how the greed and extravagance of that decade lead to the poverty of the next.  The work says few investors jumped out of windows, as most TV images suggest.This work may have relied on old footage, because doing the math makes me think that many of those interviewed could not possibly be alive in 2009.  One interviewee made it hard to focus.  He was recorded at a record store and I couldn't shake that Melissa Ethridge and Tracy Chapman LP's were displayed behind him.This was a strong work that answered many questions for me.  I think it would be highly informative to students.
