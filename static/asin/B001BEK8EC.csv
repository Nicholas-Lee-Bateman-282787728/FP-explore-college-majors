When you are young the world is more of a technicolor place and perhaps we are all unwilling to let the dark clouds into it.  I resaw this film when I was in my 50s and my reaction was much different.  There is a melancholy yet bittersweet quality to this film, almost a dreamlike glide through the corridors of memory and time.  For it is an old person who will die sooner, rather than later, who is looking back on his whole life and his memories as well as winding up his life as it exists in the present. Everyone who has made it to an older age will recognize the territory of the film at once as very, very familiar.  It is a Swedish professor who we watch on this journey.  His relationships in life have been turbulent but not out of the ordinary.  It is a beautiful film, one of Bergman's very best and he didn't make any duds.",5,Appreciation of This Film Came With Age,1253750400,"09 24, 2009",2009,953,"['When', 'watched', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'did', 'not', 'thought', 'was', 'too', 'stark', 'too', 'melancholy', 'too', 'dark', 'When', 'are', 'young', 'world', 'more', 'technicolor', 'place', 'perhaps', 'are', 'unwilling', 'let', 'dark', 'resaw', 'film', 'when', 'was', '50s', 'reaction', 'was', 'much', 'different', 'melancholy', 'yet', 'bittersweet', 'quality', 'film', 'almost', 'dreamlike', 'glide', 'corridors', 'memory', 'time', 'old', 'person', 'who', 'will', 'die', 'sooner', 'rather', 'later', 'who', 'looking', 'back', 'whole', 'life', 'memories', 'as', 'well', 'winding', 'up', 'life', 'present', 'Everyone', 'who', 'made', 'older', 'age', 'will', 'recognize', 'territory', 'film', 'once', 'very', 'very', 'familiar', 'Swedish', 'professor', 'who', 'watch', 'journey', 'relationships', 'life', 'have', 'been', 'turbulent', 'not', 'ordinary', 'beautiful', 'film', 'one', 'Bergman', 'very', 'best', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'duds']",Wild Strawberries: Essential Art House
1171949,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,B001BEK8EC,Edmonson,"[0, 0]","Ingmar Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"" (1957) follows the memories of an elderly man reminiscing about his life. Dreams, nightmares and flashbacks haunt this man as we learn about his romantic failures, and his desire to return to childhood. It is a study of old age as well as a moral inquiry into a man's life choices. This is a thoughtful film that offers us the time to reflect on the choices we make in life.",5,A reflection on a life's choices,1259625600,"12 1, 2009",2009,411,"['Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Wild', 'Strawberries', '1957', 'memories', 'elderly', 'man', 'reminiscing', 'life', 'Dreams', 'nightmares', 'flashbacks', 'haunt', 'man', 'learn', 'romantic', 'failures', 'desire', 'return', 'childhood', 'study', 'old', 'age', 'as', 'well', 'moral', 'inquiry', 'man', 'life', 'choices', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'time', 'reflect', 'choices', 'make', 'life']",Wild Strawberries: Essential Art House
1171950,A308X3FITWLF7W,B001BEK8EC,"Elvin Ortiz ""CurlyAl34""","[1, 1]","Seventy-eight year old Isak Borg journeys on his way to receive an honorary degree for his professional work. He travels in his own car accompanied by his daughter-in-law. Also he is joined by a young trio composed by two men and a woman. Throughout the film, Isak struggles with fears of loneliness and the possibility that his life has been a waste. He suffers a dream with surrealistic characteristics, where his own death in life is illustrated thru the use of handless clocks, empty streets, ruins, and faceless bodies. Through the journey we also discover his strenuous relationships with his son, daughter-in-law, and with his wife. He has dreams and reminiscences of the past that communicate to us the things that really have meaning in life. Basically, it is the tale of a person who has succeeded as a professional, but has failed as father and husband, and he discovers at the end that the price to pay for this negligence is loneliness. Isak, however, does not want to remain alone and makes attempts to amend for this hollow past.The film shows surrealistic images to dramatize Isak's existential crisis. It also contrasts an idyllic (pastoral) past with a modern middle-class life. We also get to see the lack of faith and hope in Isak and his son's life. The distinction between middle-class culture and the innocence of a rural, agrarian society can be seen in the rivalry between Isak, concerned about sin and doing the right thing, and his brother, who is passionate and incorrigible. Sara, Isak's love, stands between the two. Sara marries Isak's brother and leads a fruitful life having many children. On the other hand, Isak has been the head of a dysfunctional family. Thus, Isak must confront this past in his present struggle to find meaning in his life.This Essential Art House edition is an excellent presentation of the film. If you like this type of film, or if you are a Bergman fan, then you will enjoy this edition.",5,"Before ""About Schmidt"" there was Isak Borg",1307923200,"06 13, 2011",2011,1947,"['Seventy-eight', 'year', 'old', 'Isak', 'Borg', 'journeys', 'way', 'receive', 'honorary', 'degree', 'professional', 'work', 'own', 'car', 'accompanied', 'daughter-in-law', 'Also', 'joined', 'young', 'trio', 'composed', 'two', 'men', 'woman', 'film', 'Isak', 'fears', 'loneliness', 'possibility', 'life', 'been', 'waste', 'dream', 'surrealistic', 'characteristics', 'where', 'own', 'death', 'life', 'illustrated', 'use', 'handless', 'clocks', 'empty', 'streets', 'ruins', 'faceless', 'bodies', 'journey', 'also', 'discover', 'strenuous', 'relationships', 'son', 'daughter-in-law', 'wife', 'dreams', 'reminiscences', 'past', 'communicate', 'things', 'really', 'have', 'meaning', 'life', 'Basically', 'tale', 'person', 'who', 'succeeded', 'professional', 'failed', 'father', 'husband', 'end', 'price', 'pay', 'negligence', 'loneliness', 'Isak', 'however', 'not', 'want', 'remain', 'alone', 'attempts', 'amend', 'hollow', 'past.The', 'film', 'surrealistic', 'images', 'dramatize', 'Isak', 'existential', 'crisis', 'also', 'idyllic', 'pastoral', 'past', 'modern', 'middle-class', 'life', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'lack', 'faith', 'hope', 'Isak', 'son', 'life', 'distinction', 'middle-class', 'culture', 'innocence', 'rural', 'agrarian', 'society', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'rivalry', 'Isak', 'concerned', 'sin', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'brother', 'who', 'passionate', 'incorrigible', 'Sara', 'Isak', 'love', 'two', 'Sara', 'Isak', 'brother', 'fruitful', 'life', 'having', 'many', 'children', 'other', 'hand', 'Isak', 'been', 'head', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'Thus', 'Isak', 'must', 'confront', 'past', 'present', 'struggle', 'find', 'meaning', 'life.This', 'Essential', 'Art', 'House', 'edition', 'excellent', 'presentation', 'film', 'like', 'type', 'film', 'are', 'Bergman', 'fan', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'edition']",Wild Strawberries: Essential Art House

Gordon,"[3, 3]","An old doctor (a magnificent performance by Victor Sjostrom) takes acar trip to receive an award for 50 years in medicine, accompanied byhis daughter in law, and some teenage hitchhikers they pick up.He is tormented by highly symbolic dreams (beautifully done), and bythe realization he has kept himself at an emotional distance fromothers and the world, and now his life is racing towards it's end.Quite moving in spots, but somehow never ended up with as much power asI expected.Two critics' notes made sense to me. One said that, for as great andtransparent as Sjostrom's performance is, he is so sweet and likable apresence it's hard to reconcile him with a man his daughter in lawopenly admits she doesn't like because of his cold nature.The other point - which could also be applied to 'The Seventh Seal' isthat the film seems less special today because the stylistic barriersit broke and the doors it opened (an almost totally subjective film,dream sequences of depth and meaning, etc) have since become a familiarpart of film grammar. But at the time, this was something new andbrave. Another to re-see.Note: This transfer is the same as the excellent and more expensiveCriterion transfer, but with fewer extra features.
