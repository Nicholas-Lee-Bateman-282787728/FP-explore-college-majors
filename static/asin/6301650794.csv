260069,AUHG8KSHI529U,6301650794,Craig Matteson,"[2, 4]","While there are some moments of emotional power in this movie, too much of it is simply jarring and unrealistic in ways that make us realize we are simply watching a movie with scenes that someone thought would be good and give the actors their turn at doing something dramatic rather than allow us to pretend we are watching real people.  When the elderly parents in this film (Jack Lemmon and Olympia Dukakis playing Jack and Bette Tremont) are in the grocery store, we get a real insight into the current state of their marriage.  When she has the heart attack while shopping, it is very moving and involves us very much.  Ted Danson's opening scene as the big time investment banker is also quite believable and he plays the cool and almost emotionless businessman very well.  He is elegant, suave, understated, and handsome.  This was the peak of Danson's early fame from Cheers.We think we are going to see a movie of a senile and frail widower drawing in his children to care for him and see how they respond.  Instead, she recovers and it is Dad that is diagnosed with terminal cancer and it is the story how the family responds to that crisis which becomes the story.  The problem is that it goes off the rails.  Danson doesn't really have the ability to convey deep internal crisis on film so they have to give him a bold gesture.  Here it is carrying is post-operative father from the hospital.  Right.  Have you every seen how tender and fragile someone, particularly an elderly person is, after major surgery.  There might be a way to get him out, but being carried in your arms is not one of them.There are other false notes as well.  Olympia Dukakis is a fine actress, but the scene where she loses it at the dinner table plays too much as her turn to chew scenery than as something that would actually happen as it is played out in the film.  What she is feeling and what she says all make sense, but would be better played in another way and in another setting.When Dad finally does die, it is off screen, but the last scene of Danson and Lemmon together is quite good and credit should be given for how well they play that.  However, the last scenes of the family carrying on after the funeral do not ring true.  Everyone would be more wrung out and emotionally spent.  Everyone in the movie is about six months early in how they would react alone or together.  Immediately after the death and funeral things are much more raw rather than as portrayed in this film.  At least, that has been my experience with the death of parents and loved ones.Anyway, while not a bad film, this kind of thing was done better in another less than perfect, but much better film with Tom Hanks and Jackie Gleason, ""Nothing In Common"" from 1986.  So, I would rather see that film.  However, if you are a Ted Danson fan, then this is a movie with him on the screen a lot and about as close as he gets to drama.",3,"Has some powerful moments, but also some false ones that jar",1148688000,"05 27, 2006",2006,2909,"['are', 'moments', 'emotional', 'power', 'movie', 'too', 'much', 'simply', 'jarring', 'unrealistic', 'ways', 'make', 'realize', 'are', 'simply', 'watching', 'movie', 'scenes', 'someone', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'give', 'actors', 'turn', 'doing', 'something', 'dramatic', 'rather', 'allow', 'pretend', 'are', 'watching', 'real', 'people', 'When', 'elderly', 'parents', 'film', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'playing', 'Jack', 'Bette', 'Tremont', 'are', 'grocery', 'store', 'get', 'real', 'insight', 'current', 'state', 'marriage', 'When', 'heart', 'attack', 'shopping', 'very', 'moving', 'very', 'much', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'opening', 'scene', 'big', 'time', 'investment', 'banker', 'also', 'quite', 'believable', 'cool', 'almost', 'emotionless', 'businessman', 'very', 'well', 'elegant', 'suave', 'understated', 'handsome', 'was', 'peak', 'Danson', 'early', 'fame', 'Cheers.We', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'senile', 'frail', 'widower', 'drawing', 'children', 'care', 'see', 'how', 'respond', 'Instead', 'recovers', 'Dad', 'diagnosed', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'story', 'how', 'family', 'crisis', 'story', 'problem', 'rails', 'Danson', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'ability', 'convey', 'deep', 'internal', 'crisis', 'film', 'have', 'give', 'bold', 'gesture', 'Here', 'carrying', 'post-operative', 'father', 'hospital', 'Right', 'Have', 'seen', 'how', 'tender', 'fragile', 'someone', 'particularly', 'elderly', 'person', 'major', 'surgery', 'might', 'be', 'way', 'get', 'out', 'being', 'carried', 'arms', 'not', 'one', 'are', 'other', 'false', 'notes', 'well', 'Olympia', 'Dukakis', 'fine', 'actress', 'scene', 'where', 'dinner', 'table', 'plays', 'too', 'much', 'turn', 'chew', 'scenery', 'something', 'would', 'actually', 'happen', 'played', 'out', 'film', 'What', 'feeling', 'what', 'make', 'sense', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'played', 'way', 'setting.When', 'Dad', 'finally', 'die', 'screen', 'last', 'scene', 'Danson', 'Lemmon', 'together', 'quite', 'good', 'credit', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'how', 'well', 'play', 'However', 'last', 'scenes', 'family', 'carrying', 'funeral', 'do', 'not', 'ring', 'true', 'Everyone', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'wrung', 'emotionally', 'spent', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'six', 'months', 'early', 'how', 'would', 'react', 'alone', 'together', 'Immediately', 'death', 'funeral', 'things', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'raw', 'rather', 'portrayed', 'film', 'least', 'been', 'experience', 'death', 'parents', 'loved', 'ones.Anyway', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'kind', 'thing', 'was', 'done', 'better', 'less', 'perfect', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'Nothing', 'Common', '1986', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'film', 'However', 'are', 'Ted', 'Danson', 'fan', 'then', 'movie', 'screen', 'lot', 'as', 'close', 'drama']",N/A

No wonder, Ted was the ""star"" of some early 80s soap opera who wanted to become a real actor. Unfortunately, his choice for the path to stardom was the movie made of William Wharton's ""Dad"". The story had to be refashioned to be more glitzy - a painter became an actor. The result is rather grim and, if you haven't read the novel, difficult to follow. The story is sad - the book is saturated with nostalgia for what the heroes missed in life or realized too late to enjoy fully - the film is so so.And there is one moderately funny bit - Jack Lemmon and Olympia Dukakis through the film look as if they both wanted to ask one and the same question - What am I doing in this movie???

HARMON,"[2, 2]","If many of my other reviews have been read, then it is recognized that I can be quite verbose and sometimes eloquent.This review requires neither (though is worthy of both)... but the title speaks volumes. DAD truly is one of the most wonderful movies that I have ever viewed.A remarkable story of aging and the conflicts and love that can result there from.As a social worker in the medical field, the struggles, responsibilities and the heartbreaks of the effects of aging (on the elderly and the family alike) as portrayed in this movie are strikingly accurate. I could only wish and pray that the support and care given to Jake Tremony (Jack Lemmon) was an accurate depiction of that given to most of our elderly.CHEERS is my favorite television show of all time. With that being said I thought the second worst actor on the show was Ted Danson. I have long found his acting to be stiff and without soul (even his efforts in BODY HEAT and GULLIVER'S TRAVELS - of which I cherish both)... but in DAD Mr. Danson revealed a sincerity and depth that he rarely ever showed in any of his other efforts. I became a fan of Ted Danson after watching DAD.... and Jack Lemmon is phenomenal. He truly deserved a Golden Globe, at the very least. Any actor who can overpower a cast of Ethan Hawke, Kevin Spacey, Kathy Baker and the beloved Olympia Dukakis must be an incredible performer.

I have seen this movie several times, and every time I cry at the end!  The son lives far away and is so obsessed with work that he has not been home to see his  elderly parents much in recent years.  When his mother is unexpectedly taken ill, he comes home and is shocked to see how his father has gone down under the overprotective eye of his domineering mother.  John, the son, starts teaching his father to be independent, at the same time rebuilding a good quality relationship with him.  It is so touching later in the movie when his dad becomes ill and John dotes over him and refused to give up.  This also inspires John to build a relationship with his own son, with whom he has not had much contact.  I can relate to this story, as can anyone who has dealt with the illness and/or death of aging parents.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially anyone who has dealt or is now having to deal with the aging and/or death of a parent.
