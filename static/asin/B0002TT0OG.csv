This is the lowest budget movie I think I've ever seen attached to a major studio (Warner Bros.). Anybody giving this flick any positive word at all must be attached to the production or a relative of the filmmakers (""The scariest indie horror movie I've ever seen and in many ways stands up to the best in the genre""!!? Tell me this guy isn't the director's brother!). The acting is wooden by all involved....the script is junior copywriter-level writing....and the effects, if you can call them that, are on a par with what I could accomplish with downloaded FX software on my five-year old Compaq Prosignia. And the story, about a guy being possessed by spirits in his house? The Shining.....Amityville Horror....HELLO?! While I will concede that there are some good ideas buried deep within this film, they've been simply unable to escape. And while I was prepared for the look of digital video here, I could not believe how poor this film looked. In the few outdoor scenes, everything is generally OK, but the indoor scenes had all the color drained out of them, and the nighttime scenes were almost unwatchable in their artifacts-laden graininess. Surprising, since the ""making-of"" feature had better indoor filming, on the same damn sets!  Several horror-movie websites have also given this dribble high marks, so I am mystified.

There are plenty of scenes and attempted scares that really have no place in the movie, (like the hot tub and the fence; you will know what I mean if you see the film.)  Worse still, since this was apparently shot on video, the picture quality is lousy, and the camera reacts extremely poorly to back light - (as well as low light, and most other lighting situations for that matter).More frustrating still, is that despite the film's best efforts, it is not in the least bit frightening, save for one scene in the very beginning that made me jump.  That won't cut it, especially since being startled and being scared are two entirely different things.As for DVD extras, there is one extremely lousy behind the scenes of production, one interesting featurette behind the computer effects and image layering, a number of deleted scenes, and a trailer, and a one ore two other assorted extras.But since the film is this bad, the DVD extras should not determine whether or not you give it a rental.

845149,AKQNN9U5GZSWL,B0002TT0OG,"Raymond F. Fitzpatrick ""Ignore this, was for ...","[5, 9]","This is a classic ghost story, pure and simple...with an interesting tweak or two.  And that is part of its charm, in a day where hack `n slash and witty self-referential dialogue rules the genre...it's a throwback to the Twilight Zone and the Tales from the Crypt style of storytelling.Another aspect of its charm is that this is the Little Picture That Could. Writer/director/editor/half-the-sound-department Stefan Avalos (The Last Broadcast) and his partner in crime, producer Marianne Connor, push their independent, itty-bitty budget way past the envelope.  Sometimes it shows...many of the effects have the earmarks of video effects (good video effects, but still video effects)...but often, you don't even realize that the effects were done on the computer instead of a makeup lab, or that the sky had to be repainted. Avalos and company made their own dollies for track shots, and even pulled off an effect shot by hand that is normally done with a motion tracking rig.  Essentially, they shouldn't have been able to pull this picture off, and because they did it so well, one tends to forgive the areas where it's a tad rough.Avalos has crafted a film where the reality of the situation is up to the viewer, and he's done this using traditional ghost story trappings (and an unhealthy dash of Hollywood paranoia). It's story that would have fallen flat on its face if the leads were not cast so amazingly well. Wastell alternates between charmingly laid back and stone cold creepy with apparent ease, and Ficara's arc covers practically every emotion in an actor's repertoire...and she nails it every time. What's more, both actors have an innate sex appeal that, combined with their range and ability to project their emotions onto the screen, makes Avalos very lucky that he found these two before they get snatched up by the major studios.As for the DVD itself, it's packed with behind-the-scenes tidbits, and advice on the dos and don'ts of independant film making. The FX section practically shows you how to do it yourself.

For a low budget film, it's actually pretty good.What the film is not: It's not a fast-paced intense horror film, so the box art is a little misleading.What the film is: It's a low-budget film made with some care. In terms of quality it reminded me of some of the Asian soap operas my wife watches (which are shot in actual rooms rather than on sets): you can see that there wasn't a huge budget, and it runs a little slow, but the quality is decent enough that you can keep watching pretty easily.Most of the primary actors have some talent. The couple actors who are horribly stiff thankfully have had very small parts in the film.  The main character is a woman (Christine Charters?) and the actress who plays her is great. She's a capable actress, she's pretty, and she's seen in some revealing outfits.I could recommend buying this film used, but more for people who like independent film than horror movie fans.

Too bad, it's a fun movie.While it's not exactly ""Don't be Afraid of the Dark"", it's not ""Don't Go in the Woods"" either.The story of two people from back east who move to Hollywood to make their fortune, Rachel and Kevin luck into a new Hollywood Hills pad, complete with Hollywood sign view, the belongings of the former owners who high-tailed it into the night so fast they didn't bother to clean out the icebox, and (wait for it) a price TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!!Sadly, since they are trying to break into films as scriptwriters, they don't see the big giant warning signs that something might be a little (ahem) askew on Edendale hill, even when various neighbors show up to ominously tell them that the former occupants didn't fit in and that the street used to be the center of Hollywood's first studio.Rachel, who has a convenient past as both a model and a loony, has, in rapid sucession, ghost sightings and a job modelling in New York.  Since their writing isn't going anywhere, and they need the money (and the movie isn't moving very fast) she hits the big Apple fo the gig.Ten seconds or so later, she's back, and things on the hill are changed:  Kevin's suddenly a filmland Zane Grey, banging away at his laptop with a screenplay that has the whole hill abuzz.  Rachel is convinced there must be something terribly wrong!Is Kevin in the clutches of the ghost of Tom Mix, bent upon recreating his Hollywood comeback?  Is Rachel really just losing her mind?  Didn't anybody see ""Burnt Offerings""?Like I said, there are a few big flaws in this movie: They seem to want to have it about 5 ways about how we are supposed to are be taking what we're seeing (Witness the ending, which I won't give away), and anyone who had been enough of a movie buff to want to write one would have seen this plot before.  While I applaud the film-makers for not going all Kevin Williamson self-referential on us, it's still a bit of a hole.The movie was shot on DV and seemingly in availble light.  To some, it gives an immediacy to the movie that really works, some people will find it annoying.  It worked for me (and I know that street, it's incredibly steep; I have no isea how they got equipment up there).  The actors are decent, although it would have worked better to have made Rachel a soap-opera actress instead of a fashion model.  Not that she isn't a beautiful girl with a spectacular figure, but let's just say that Janice Dickinson would flay her alive if she showed up on ANTM.This is a fun movie that will give a few chills and a few thrills.  I enjoyed it, especially the DVD extras (where they practically give you a primer on how to do an indy movie of your own)  The makers of this clearly love movies; I'd love to see what they'd do if they had a slightly better worked out script and a lot more money.",3,"Not haunting, but hardly horrrible",1109548800,"02 28, 2005",2005,2995,"['warning-', 'disc', 'degraded', '6', 'viewings', 'point', 'where', 'would', 'not', 'play', 'iBook', 'DVD', 'player', 'Tke', 'following', 'review', 'grain', 'salt', 'Too', 'bad', 'fun', 'not', 'exactly', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'Afraid', 'Dark', 'not', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Woods', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'back', 'east', 'who', 'move', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'fortune', 'Rachel', 'Kevin', 'luck', 'new', 'Hollywood', 'Hills', 'pad', 'complete', 'Hollywood', 'sign', 'view', 'belongings', 'former', 'owners', 'who', 'high-tailed', 'night', 'so', 'fast', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'clean', 'out', 'icebox', 'wait', 'price', 'TOO', 'GOOD', 'TO', 'BE', 'TRUE', 'Sadly', 'are', 'trying', 'break', 'films', 'scriptwriters', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'big', 'giant', 'warning', 'signs', 'something', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'ahem', 'askew', 'Edendale', 'hill', 'even', 'when', 'various', 'neighbors', 'show', 'up', 'ominously', 'tell', 'former', 'occupants', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'street', 'used', 'be', 'center', 'Hollywood', 'first', 'studio.Rachel', 'who', 'convenient', 'past', 'model', 'loony', 'rapid', 'sucession', 'ghost', 'sightings', 'job', 'modelling', 'New', 'York', 'writing', ""n't"", 'going', 'anywhere', 'need', 'money', 'movie', ""n't"", 'moving', 'very', 'fast', 'big', 'Apple', 'fo', 'gig.Ten', 'so', 'later', 'back', 'things', 'hill', 'are', 'changed', 'Kevin', 'suddenly', 'filmland', 'Zane', 'Grey', 'banging', 'away', 'laptop', 'screenplay', 'whole', 'hill', 'abuzz', 'Rachel', 'convinced', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'Kevin', 'clutches', 'ghost', 'Tom', 'Mix', 'bent', 'recreating', 'Hollywood', 'comeback', 'Rachel', 'really', 'just', 'losing', 'mind', 'Did', ""n't"", 'anybody', 'see', 'Burnt', 'Offerings', 'said', 'are', 'few', 'big', 'flaws', 'movie', 'seem', 'want', 'have', '5', 'ways', 'how', 'are', 'supposed', 'are', 'be', 'taking', 'what', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'enough', 'movie', 'buff', 'want', 'write', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'plot', 'applaud', 'film-makers', 'not', 'going', 'Kevin', 'Williamson', 'self-referential', 'still', 'bit', 'hole.The', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'DV', 'seemingly', 'availble', 'light', 'immediacy', 'movie', 'really', 'people', 'will', 'find', 'annoying', 'worked', 'know', 'street', 'incredibly', 'steep', 'have', 'isea', 'how', 'got', 'equipment', 'up', 'there', 'actors', 'are', 'decent', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'have', 'made', 'Rachel', 'soap-opera', 'actress', 'instead', 'fashion', 'model', 'Not', ""n't"", 'beautiful', 'girl', 'spectacular', 'figure', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Janice', 'Dickinson', 'would', 'flay', 'alive', 'showed', 'up', 'ANTM.This', 'fun', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'few', 'chills', 'few', 'thrills', 'enjoyed', 'especially', 'DVD', 'extras', 'where', 'practically', 'give', 'primer', 'how', 'do', 'indy', 'movie', 'own', 'makers', 'clearly', 'love', 'movies', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'what', ""'d"", 'do', 'had', 'slightly', 'better', 'worked', 'out', 'script', 'lot', 'more', 'money']",The Ghosts of Edendale
