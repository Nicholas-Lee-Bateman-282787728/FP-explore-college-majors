I wish the whole series was available as it would be nice, and probably more economical, to purchase the series as a set. The three season pack was nice though and I hope the rest of the series is offered in similar packs as I will purchase the remaining seasons as they become available. Some people may find the filming a little ""grainy"" but I don't think this is the video quality; I have watched it on the channels where it is in syndication and it looks the same so I think this is the way it was filmed originally-just not that crystal clarity that we are used to with most things now.
