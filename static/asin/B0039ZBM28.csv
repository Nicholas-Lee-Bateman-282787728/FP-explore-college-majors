1334481,A1BDPIQ8LPN4CP,B0039ZBM28,Kris,"[0, 2]",The premise was good and it started out really well.  She was determined to make people realise that she didn't need a man to make her life complete.  Enter the man and she turned into one of the women she was trying not to be.  I didn't like that she didn't tell the guy about her decision to marry herself and his reaction was predictable.  There are so many ways this movie should have gone but it didn't do it for me.  It's a shame because it had so many possibilities.,1,Wedding for One,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,473,"['premise', 'was', 'good', 'started', 'out', 'really', 'well', 'was', 'determined', 'make', 'people', 'realise', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'man', 'make', 'life', 'complete', 'Enter', 'man', 'turned', 'one', 'women', 'was', 'trying', 'not', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'tell', 'guy', 'decision', 'marry', 'reaction', 'was', 'predictable', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'shame', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'possibilities']",N/A
