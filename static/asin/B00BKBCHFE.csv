1635282,AOB5695UUUJ0,B00BKBCHFE,"Anime Lover ""D""","[2, 2]","I got it when it first came out and only just finished it (so many other things on my plate lately that I do not have the time to watch as much anime as I used to - and gen con) and I will admit that the story is enjoyable and entertaining.  Urabe is the newest transfer student, and she is not exactly fitting into Tsubake's class.  her hair covers her eyes, she laughs for no reason in class, and she falls asleep on a dime.  But it is when she is sleeping that the magic begins.  When she is awoken, she leaves behind a small pool of drool - which our hero samples.  But when he becomes sick - Urabe realizes that he is the one for her as they have a connection with the drool and they can sense how the other is feeling.  Add to the fact that she carries a pair of scissors in her panties, which she uses with devistating effect.  But when another girl in the class also has a connection with Urabe, she begins to realize that having someone to connect with is not so bad.  Now can this unusual couple bring about the happy ending, even when trying to keep it a secret from everyone else.I enjoyed this, a more realistic romance humor story than most anime this day.  You really feel for the characters and enjoy the development and relationships that they have.  The soundtrack and scenes are well done and I really wish they would do a second season, but they really did not leave that type of opening.  I give this a must have for any collection.",5,Finally finished this excellent story,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,1453,"['got', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'only', 'just', 'finished', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'plate', 'lately', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'time', 'watch', 'much', 'anime', 'used', 'gen', 'con', 'will', 'admit', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'entertaining', 'Urabe', 'newest', 'transfer', 'student', 'not', 'exactly', 'fitting', 'Tsubake', 'class', 'hair', 'eyes', 'reason', 'class', 'asleep', 'dime', 'when', 'sleeping', 'magic', 'When', 'awoken', 'small', 'pool', 'drool', 'hero', 'samples', 'when', 'sick', 'Urabe', 'one', 'have', 'connection', 'drool', 'can', 'sense', 'how', 'other', 'feeling', 'Add', 'fact', 'pair', 'scissors', 'panties', 'devistating', 'effect', 'when', 'girl', 'class', 'also', 'connection', 'Urabe', 'realize', 'having', 'someone', 'connect', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'Now', 'can', 'unusual', 'couple', 'bring', 'happy', 'ending', 'even', 'when', 'trying', 'keep', 'secret', 'everyone', 'else.I', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'realistic', 'romance', 'humor', 'story', 'most', 'anime', 'day', 'really', 'feel', 'characters', 'enjoy', 'development', 'relationships', 'have', 'soundtrack', 'scenes', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'do', 'second', 'season', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'type', 'opening', 'give', 'must', 'have', 'collection']",Mysterious Girlfriend X: Complete Collection

1635285,A36INLW8OL3A73,B00BKBCHFE,"D. Aiken ""social observer""","[19, 20]","There are techniques used by storytellers and others to grab the audience and to hold their attention;this crazy series grabs a ""handful"" and doesn't let go,even when it becomes clear the two are heading down the path to probable romance. The initial tasting of her drool may feel like a slap across the eyes to even the most hardy of otako's and cause the weak to run screaming from the room but if you take it as a French kiss... without the tongue...and the kiss...,well,it still is a bit off the wall.The tasting of drool,so goes the storyline,tells the taster the true feelings of the the drool doner that they are unable to express in words,but only if there is a ""connection"" to the other person.What you will get is a great,well-drawn,dare I say,intelligent series about a male teenager that falls for a very strange teen-aged girl that,among other weirdness,carries a pair of scissors in her panties, even in her bikini while she sunbathes at the beach.For whatever reason,she pulls the scissors out and uses them to astonishing effect on whatever object that she targets.Probably one of the best offerings from the anime ""gods"" this season and is on my ""must buy"" list. Easily PG-13 but probably aimed for the 16-17 age group. I got my copy quickly and it is a first-rate product. The ""fan-serv"" in this edition remains the same few times she pulls her scissors out and the ""nudity"" is,even without details,(ie,no nipples)the nude bodies are further shaded or blurred. As the story is the purpose of this series and not fan-service,it is most highly recommended.",5,Mysterious Girlfriend X,1362614400,"03 7, 2013",2013,1572,"['are', 'techniques', 'used', 'storytellers', 'others', 'grab', 'audience', 'hold', 'attention', 'crazy', 'series', 'grabs', 'handful', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'even', 'when', 'clear', 'two', 'are', 'heading', 'down', 'path', 'probable', 'romance', 'initial', 'tasting', 'drool', 'may', 'feel', 'slap', 'eyes', 'even', 'most', 'hardy', 'otako', 'cause', 'weak', 'run', 'screaming', 'room', 'take', 'French', 'kiss', 'tongue', 'kiss', 'well', 'still', 'bit', 'wall.The', 'tasting', 'drool', 'so', 'storyline', 'taster', 'true', 'feelings', 'drool', 'doner', 'are', 'unable', 'express', 'words', 'only', 'connection', 'other', 'person.What', 'will', 'get', 'great', 'well-drawn', 'dare', 'say', 'intelligent', 'series', 'male', 'teenager', 'very', 'strange', 'teen-aged', 'girl', 'other', 'weirdness', 'pair', 'scissors', 'panties', 'even', 'bikini', 'beach.For', 'reason', 'scissors', 'out', 'astonishing', 'effect', 'object', 'targets.Probably', 'one', 'best', 'offerings', 'anime', 'gods', 'season', 'must', 'buy', 'list', 'Easily', 'PG-13', 'probably', 'aimed', '16-17', 'age', 'group', 'got', 'copy', 'quickly', 'first-rate', 'product', 'fan-serv', 'edition', 'same', 'few', 'times', 'scissors', 'out', 'nudity', 'even', 'details', 'ie', 'nipples', 'nude', 'bodies', 'are', 'further', 'shaded', 'blurred', 'story', 'purpose', 'series', 'not', 'fan-service', 'most', 'highly', 'recommended']",Mysterious Girlfriend X: Complete Collection

1635290,A6BHE6E9VV5BE,B00BKBCHFE,Nishi,"[20, 23]","The initial impression I had from this anime is that this would be a really queer series to watch. I decided to give it a try since crunchyroll had it available for subscription and I actually enjoyed watching the story and seeing the characters progress through their problems.Story:The premise is that a new transfer student names Urabe comes into the class of the main character Akira and she ends up creeping everyone out by out bursting into laughter. One day Akria comes back into the class late and wakes up Urabe and tells her to go home and she ends up leaving a drool puddle on her desk. For some unknown reason Akira decides to lick that drool.Throughout the series Urabe's drool has some mysterious effect on Akira. This is really out there with the drool thing, but the story does suck you in and makes you want to know what events take place each episode. I never found it to be predictable at all with a really unique character like Urabe. The series definitely has more a mature theme, but I never found it to be creepy, it's just how the characters are.Animation:The animation is pretty cool in this series. It has the high-definition quality of 1080p, but the character design have that classic 1990/2000's look to them a bit and it ends up blending together wonderfully. The locations they visit and the school setting all look amazing in HD and you never get bored watching the events taking place. The main characters themselves have their own unique look to them and you can tell who's who even if they are in the school outfits, or city clothes.Soundtrack:Some of the themes are really, really cool. The main one I love is the dream theme; which is the song that plays when Akira has a dream, or any dream like sequence that plays out during the anime. It was really nothing I have heard before and was stuck in my head for a while. The other themes are mainly a mix of the opening and ending themes.Speaking of the opening and ending songs, the voice actress for Urabe actually sings both of them. I only found this out by looking at IMDB and I thought this was pretty cool that she can both act and sing really well. The opening theme reminds me a bit of Chobits though, since you can hear a bit of theme at the start of it. The closing theme is interesting to listen to as well.Verdict:I really enjoyed watching this anime and it's nothing like I have seen before. The memorable soundtrack, characters and story make this a series I really recommend to anyone who enjoys anime; especially those who like stories about relationships. Granted I know the droll thing can make some people not want to watch this anime at all, but is it really that odd compared to series that have aliens with superpowers that shoot beams, or giant robots fighting intergalactic wars? If you can get past the droll theme, you're in for one of the most unusual and great series out there.Positive:* Really cool story that sucks you in* Never found it to be predictable* Great mix of classic character design with High Definition Resolution* Characters are identifiable with unique design* Dream theme is amazing and extremely memorableNegative:* Drool thing might turn away some people* Also has some mature themes in the episodes",5,Not your typical anime,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,3234,"['initial', 'impression', 'had', 'anime', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'queer', 'series', 'watch', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'crunchyroll', 'had', 'available', 'subscription', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'story', 'seeing', 'characters', 'progress', 'problems.Story', 'premise', 'new', 'transfer', 'student', 'names', 'Urabe', 'class', 'main', 'character', 'Akira', 'up', 'creeping', 'everyone', 'out', 'out', 'bursting', 'laughter', 'One', 'day', 'Akria', 'back', 'class', 'late', 'up', 'Urabe', 'go', 'home', 'up', 'leaving', 'drool', 'puddle', 'desk', 'unknown', 'reason', 'Akira', 'lick', 'series', 'Urabe', 'drool', 'mysterious', 'effect', 'Akira', 'really', 'there', 'drool', 'thing', 'story', 'suck', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'episode', 'never', 'found', 'be', 'predictable', 'really', 'unique', 'character', 'Urabe', 'series', 'definitely', 'more', 'mature', 'theme', 'never', 'found', 'be', 'creepy', 'just', 'how', 'characters', 'are.Animation', 'animation', 'pretty', 'cool', 'series', 'high-definition', 'quality', '1080p', 'character', 'design', 'have', 'classic', '1990/2000', 'look', 'bit', 'up', 'blending', 'together', 'wonderfully', 'locations', 'visit', 'school', 'setting', 'look', 'amazing', 'HD', 'never', 'get', 'bored', 'watching', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'unique', 'look', 'can', 'tell', 'who', 'who', 'even', 'are', 'school', 'outfits', 'city', 'clothes.Soundtrack', 'themes', 'are', 'really', 'really', 'cool', 'main', 'one', 'love', 'dream', 'theme', 'song', 'when', 'Akira', 'dream', 'dream', 'sequence', 'out', 'anime', 'was', 'really', 'nothing', 'have', 'heard', 'was', 'stuck', 'head', 'while', 'other', 'themes', 'are', 'mainly', 'mix', 'opening', 'ending', 'themes.Speaking', 'opening', 'ending', 'songs', 'voice', 'actress', 'Urabe', 'actually', 'only', 'found', 'out', 'looking', 'IMDB', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'can', 'act', 'sing', 'really', 'well', 'opening', 'theme', 'bit', 'Chobits', 'can', 'hear', 'bit', 'theme', 'start', 'closing', 'theme', 'interesting', 'listen', 'well.Verdict', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'anime', 'nothing', 'have', 'seen', 'memorable', 'soundtrack', 'characters', 'story', 'make', 'series', 'really', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'anime', 'especially', 'who', 'stories', 'relationships', 'Granted', 'know', 'droll', 'thing', 'can', 'make', 'people', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'anime', 'really', 'odd', 'compared', 'series', 'have', 'aliens', 'superpowers', 'shoot', 'beams', 'giant', 'robots', 'fighting', 'intergalactic', 'wars', 'can', 'get', 'droll', 'theme', ""'re"", 'one', 'most', 'unusual', 'great', 'series', 'there.Positive', '*', 'Really', 'cool', 'story', 'in*', 'Never', 'found', 'be', 'predictable*', 'Great', 'mix', 'classic', 'character', 'design', 'High', 'Definition', 'Resolution*', 'Characters', 'are', 'identifiable', 'unique', 'design*', 'Dream', 'theme', 'amazing', 'extremely', 'memorableNegative', '*', 'Drool', 'thing', 'might', 'turn', 'away', 'people*', 'Also', 'mature', 'themes', 'episodes']",Mysterious Girlfriend X: Complete Collection
1635291,AS77LVLUSX18R,B00BKBCHFE,Roy Basilisk,"[3, 3]","I took a chance on Mysterious Girlfriend X after being torn between what sounded like an unappealing oddball premise on one hand (a show about a girl and her drool?), and on the other many positive impressions, including of the English dub, at pro review sites.  What I discovered was indeed an unexpected gem.The ""drool"" aspect of the show is essentially used as a direct conduit of emotional expression between characters, primarily between leads Tsubaki and his truly mysterious girlfriend Urabe. When she offers her drool to him he can get an intense link to her emotional state, as she can his if she decides to take from him.This leads to well-directed and beautifully animated scenes (with an ""old-school"" sense of art direction) that address topics from jealousy and dissatisfaction, through happiness, and at times to exploring sensuality.  The show is actually relatively low on explicit visual fanservice, yet the maturely handled scenarios actually end up making less into more as the affably confused Tsubaki and the charmingly unpredictable Urabe evolve their relationship.Mysterious Girlfriend X also benefits by being both one of Sentai's best-looking Blu-ray releases AND indeed possessing one of their better recent English dubs (led by Genevieve Simmons as Urabe and Josh Grelle as Tsubaki) .

1635295,AAGLJJ0OUBO8V,B00BKBCHFE,Tim,"[3, 3]","I guess that to say Mysterious Girlfriend X is different would actually be an extreme understatement. To say that it's a love it or hate it anime, that's probably more accurate. The plot follows the romance between Mikoto Urabe, an unusual girl who within one episode bursts into a fit of maniacal laughter seemingly for no reason (she also she wields scissors as a weapon with some skill) and Akira Tsubaki, the guy who's addicted to her drool. Yes, you read that last part right. Some will immediately be turned off by the fact that this series is about a guy whose connection to his girlfriend is through her drool. The drool is very much a part of this series and yes, for many people this will be too much.For those okay with this though, you're in for a treat. The animation on this series is STUNNING. Beautiful, gorgeous, a thesaurus will run out of words and not heap enough praise on the artistic merits of this series. In the opening episode there is a dream sequence involving a dance, and I knew from that moment I would have to watch the series to the end simply because of the visuals. The blu only makes it better. There are seriously some scenes that it feels like you could pause at any moment and hang the image on a wall.Now that I've talked about the artistic merits, let me say, the story is amusing. There are several laugh out loud moments. The plot has some interesting turns and the series has better than average voice acting. Part of the fun of this series is listening to Urabe, who does not even sound like your usual anime character... she sounds like a real person in terms of her voice, which only adds to the strangeness of her character. For those who care there is an English dub included, which is surprising given Sentai's usual releases (I cannot judge the dub though as I'm a subtitle only person).Some will probably complain that there is a lot in this series that goes unexplained. Some of the explanations for the weirder aspects seem illogical, and keep the viewer expecting for a different answer that will never arrive. While this may be annoying, I must point out that the title is ""Mysterious"" Girlfriend X. The title lets you in a little on this before you even watch the show, so you can't say they didn't warn you.I'm honestly a little surprised this series got a release in the US let alone a blu-ray release. The plot is a little out there and no doubt a little gross to some. Yet, the novelty of this one is part of the charm. Hopefully Sentai will give more unique anime a chance here in the US. I highly suggest that if you're an anime fan you give it a shot.
