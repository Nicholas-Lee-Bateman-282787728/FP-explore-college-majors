It is difficult to portray the feeling that raw electric blues ignites when played by such an epic performer as Walter Trout in words, so I recommend watching for oneself.  This video will not disappoint any avid blues fan.",5,Great blues artist,1341619200,"07 7, 2012",2012,358,"['Walter', 'Trout', 'gave', 'epic', 'performance', 'Amsterdam', 'NL', 'video', 'depicted', 'soul', 'electric', 'blues', 'relentless', 'energy', 'difficult', 'portray', 'feeling', 'raw', 'electric', 'blues', 'when', 'played', 'such', 'epic', 'performer', 'Walter', 'Trout', 'words', 'recommend', 'watching', 'oneself', 'video', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'avid', 'blues', 'fan']",N/A

Absolutely superb performance with audio and video to match. I've followed this band for 10-12 years now and he is getting better and better sense his sobriety. Wish I was there for this one, but this DVD will have to do. If you like blistering guitar, a tight backup band, Blues, Rock and good times, get this DVD. He gives Joe Bonamassa a tight run for guitar licks. Exta Highly recommended.I wish Amazon had a 3 criteria rating that would make for a quicker, more accurate and fair rating of Cd's, DVD's and Blu-ray's.1. Performance2. Quality of Audio3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's)1.*****2.*****3.*****Artists that wish to have there performances recorded and recognized should be held to a standard. Poor Audio or Video, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard Audio or Video quality recordings and rank that product highly just because of performance are not doing the industry or the band justice.

776865,A3L3G7ZETTVJDL,B0000D0YXC,R. Barry,"[0, 0]","I had the privilege of seeing Walter Trout at Chan's in Woonsocket, Rhode Island last summer with my brother.  Having already become familiar with his music, I knew I was in for an incredible treat, and we were absolutely not disappointed.  My brother and I have seen pretty much all the great bands (Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, The Who, etc., etc.) during their prime in the 70s.  So, maybe Walter Trout isn't Led Zeppelin, but we were blown away by Walter's playing!  My collection of his CDs exceeds every other band I own.  If I could give this DVD 6 stars I would.  Words fail to describe his talent adequately, so just plop down the best $18.00 you'll spend this year and you will never regret it.  It will become one of your favorites.  I highly recommend his ""Life In The Jungle"", ""Prisoner Of A Dream"", and ""Positively Beale Street"" CDs.  After listening to these musical treasures, I'm sure you will fill out your collection like every else is.  There's lots of AMAZING reviews for mediocre CDs out there....trust me, this is not one of them.

776866,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0000D0YXC,Robert I. Hedges,"[1, 1]","Walter Trout's ""Relentless: The Concert"" is a brilliant DVD taken from a concert at the Paradiso in Amsterdam (watch for the amusing band introduction) and is a wonderful sampling of Trout's brand of blues-rock. The set list is outstanding and highlights Trout's versatility as a guitarist and songwriter; the opening track, ""Dust My Broom"" sets the bar high and the gig only gets better from there. The photography is excellent, and the sound quality is equally impressive, making this a must have for any Trout fan.Although some people criticize Trout as derivative (all modern music is to a degree,) I think this DVD shows why he's the real deal: he writes great songs and knows his way up and down the fretboard better than most anyone currently recording in the genre. I particularly appreciate his candor with the audience and his explanations of the songs. There is an amazing amount of insight about Trout's viewpoints from his introductions; I particularly appreciated his devotion to his wife Marie and sons (I was especially entertained by the humorously poignant intro to ""I'm Tired."")Any fan of Walter Trout, smoking guitar work, rock, or blues will find something to love about this DVD. I highly recommend it to any music fan.",5,Simply Superb,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1241,"['Walter', 'Trout', 'Relentless', 'Concert', 'brilliant', 'DVD', 'taken', 'concert', 'Paradiso', 'Amsterdam', 'watch', 'amusing', 'band', 'introduction', 'wonderful', 'sampling', 'Trout', 'brand', 'blues-rock', 'set', 'list', 'outstanding', 'highlights', 'Trout', 'versatility', 'guitarist', 'songwriter', 'opening', 'track', 'Dust', 'My', 'Broom', 'bar', 'high', 'gig', 'only', 'better', 'there', 'photography', 'excellent', 'sound', 'quality', 'equally', 'impressive', 'making', 'must', 'have', 'Trout', 'people', 'criticize', 'derivative', 'modern', 'music', 'degree', 'think', 'DVD', 'why', 'real', 'deal', 'great', 'songs', 'way', 'fretboard', 'better', 'most', 'anyone', 'currently', 'recording', 'genre', 'particularly', 'appreciate', 'candor', 'audience', 'explanations', 'songs', 'amazing', 'amount', 'insight', 'Trout', 'viewpoints', 'introductions', 'particularly', 'appreciated', 'devotion', 'wife', 'Marie', 'sons', 'was', 'especially', 'entertained', 'humorously', 'poignant', 'intro', ""'m"", 'Tired', 'fan', 'Walter', 'Trout', 'smoking', 'guitar', 'work', 'rock', 'blues', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'love', 'DVD', 'highly', 'recommend', 'music', 'fan']",N/A
776867,A1E8S9L3B455N3,B0000D0YXC,Samuel G. Powell,"[9, 11]","I only give 5 star reviews, because I'm only interested in turning people on to the things I love most.  Walter Trout has just entered that category.  Playing just his stratocaster through a Mesa Boogie Mark IV amp with the rare Mesa Boogie Leslie-copy rotating speaker and no effects, Walter Trout pulls out all the stops in this incredible concert.He has been unfairly accused of being derivative (gimme a break!  ALL blues rock is derivative!)  He has been unfairly accused of copping Stevie Ray's style and riffs. They have common blues roots, but Trout is much less reliant on effects, and clearly has his own chops influenced by a number of the blues greats (Albert King, to name one) and he even pulls off some of the same speed and volume-knob manipulation of the late great Roy Buchanan.  Plus, having played with John Lee Hooker and Big Mama Thornton, he has firmly established his credibility as a genuine bluesman, even if he is doing blues/rock now.  To put it simply, he's absorbed the best blues/rock influences and blended them into his own passionate, fiery style.I'm a fair guitarit myself, and after one viewing of the DVD and several listens to the CD of Relentless, Trout is the one guitarist whose style I would most aspire to master.  As a solo act he is generous to his band members in letting them stretch out on their own instruments instead of just having them playing rote accompaniment.It is also clear that lyrically he comes from a very genuine place.  Collingswood is a great example, wherein he effectively conveys the fear, pain and anger (and relief and comfort from other family) of growing up in a household with a violent alcoholic stepfather.  He pulls his blues from deep within his own soul, and when he rocks hard he takes his solos right up to the edge of cacophony, momentarily crosses that line, and then takes complete melodic control again.  If he has anything like a weak point it would be his acoustic songs, which don't quite convey the same passion as his electric work, but even then he still packs more genuine emotion and heartfelt melody into the acoustic material than most other acts in his genre.If you love blues, rock, blues/rock, and even some metal guitar, this DVD is a rare treasure.  I sat dumbfounded with a satisfied smirk on my face through the entire first viewing of this DVD.  The production values are also a guitarist's dream, with the visual focus clearly placed on Trout's style and technique.  The interviews, while not slickly produced or eloquent, reveal exactly what you'd want to know about this virtuoso after hearing him - his gear and how he uses it, influences and background - all relevant background on his music and how he makes it.I like this every bit as much as anything by Johnny Winter, Roy Buchanan, Gary Moore, Stevie Ray, Clapton, or any of the other rock/blues fusion guitarists.  Only one copy in stock as I write this - I really hope Amazon and Ruf records will keep making this available to the world.  I'd heard of Walter Trout some time ago when I lived in Orange County CA, and now I'm kicking myself in the okole for not seeing him at the coachhouse or other clubs there - odds are he won't be playing in Hawaii anytime soon.
