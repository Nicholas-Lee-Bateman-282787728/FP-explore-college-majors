153071,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,079284548X,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[7, 11]","This is, above all, a story about love.  It shows several different renditions of love and how it effects each of us.  All of our characters in this story are in love or about to experience love and will each deal with it in their own way. Father Chu, one of our main characters, lost his wife many years ago, and has been handed the task of caring for his three girls.  He has not had the proper guidance in how to bring them up, and he always put his cooking before them, so it comes as no surprise that these three girls have grown up as three individual women.  Each carries their own passions and secrets in life.  The eldest, Jia-Jen is a teacher that claims to have lost love a very long time ago and has never had the urge to rediscover it.  The middle child, Jia-Chien is a very powerful airline executive that does wonders in the working environment, but is lost in the outside world (especially the world surrounding her family).  Finally, there is the youngest, Jia-Ning, a student and fast food worker that wants what others have.  Together, these four people make up a family, and Lee tells their story.If you are new to Ang Lee films, it may be hard to watch this movie without enjoying the presence of a huge green man jumping mountains.  For those veteran viewers of his work, this film will be seen as no surprise.  This is a classic Ang Lee film.  The themes of family, struggle, and love are dominant throughout all of his films.  Eat Drink Man Woman is no exception.  Lee does a fabulous job of crafting the boundaries of the family, providing the viewer with those awkwardly tense moments that make you feel that you are actually sitting there with the family as they air their ""dirty laundry"".  By pulling us into this film and giving us some raw performances by the actors, you cannot help but somehow feel connected to this film.  We have all experienced love (or even lust) at one point in our lives and understand the hardships that follow this joyous experience, especially if you grow up in a house similar to the one run by Father Chu.  On an emotional level, this film works very well, but it is the other areas where this film does not succeed.Pacing, inconsistency, and underdeveloped center are what hurt this film in the long run.  Lee has built a structure with this film by creating a powerful beginning and a heart wrenching conclusion, but what lies in the middle is nothing but leftovers.  Our main characters are inconsistent, jumping from one unsuspecting emotion to the next as they finally reach their one ""true"" moment.  This is due in part by Lee's direction.  When I first started this film, I felt that the story, camera, and direction were tight.  It was flowing very well and my attention was focused directly on the film.  About forty-five minutes in, I found my eyes wandering.  I felt less connected with the characters as they stumbled through their lives and into love.  Suddenly, it was as if Lee had awakened, and his style and power was reinstated for the last couple of scenes.  This was my only complaint about this film.  I needed more structure and development in the center so that I could fully enjoy the ending, but it never happened.Overall, Lee did an average job with this film.  He has pure talent, and it is seen in his later films, but in this one I just couldn't put my arms around the middle of this film.  I would suggest at least one viewing if you are an Ang Lee fan, but definatly not worth a second.Grade:  **  out of ****",3,Raising daughters is like cooking a meal.,1094688000,"09 9, 2004",2004,3500,"['story', 'love', 'several', 'different', 'renditions', 'love', 'how', 'effects', 'characters', 'story', 'are', 'love', 'experience', 'love', 'will', 'deal', 'own', 'way', 'Father', 'Chu', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'lost', 'wife', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'been', 'handed', 'task', 'caring', 'three', 'girls', 'not', 'had', 'proper', 'guidance', 'how', 'bring', 'up', 'always', 'put', 'cooking', 'surprise', 'three', 'girls', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'three', 'individual', 'women', 'own', 'passions', 'secrets', 'life', 'eldest', 'Jia-Jen', 'teacher', 'have', 'lost', 'love', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'never', 'had', 'urge', 'rediscover', 'middle', 'child', 'Jia-Chien', 'very', 'powerful', 'airline', 'executive', 'wonders', 'working', 'environment', 'lost', 'outside', 'world', 'especially', 'world', 'surrounding', 'family', 'Finally', 'youngest', 'Jia-Ning', 'student', 'fast', 'food', 'worker', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'Together', 'four', 'people', 'make', 'up', 'family', 'Lee', 'story.If', 'are', 'new', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'films', 'may', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'movie', 'enjoying', 'presence', 'huge', 'green', 'man', 'jumping', 'mountains', 'veteran', 'viewers', 'work', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'surprise', 'classic', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'film', 'themes', 'family', 'struggle', 'love', 'are', 'dominant', 'films', 'Eat', 'Drink', 'Man', 'Woman', 'exception', 'Lee', 'fabulous', 'job', 'crafting', 'boundaries', 'family', 'providing', 'viewer', 'awkwardly', 'tense', 'moments', 'make', 'feel', 'are', 'actually', 'sitting', 'family', 'air', 'dirty', 'laundry', 'pulling', 'film', 'giving', 'raw', 'performances', 'actors', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'somehow', 'feel', 'connected', 'film', 'have', 'experienced', 'love', 'even', 'lust', 'one', 'point', 'lives', 'understand', 'hardships', 'follow', 'joyous', 'experience', 'especially', 'grow', 'up', 'house', 'similar', 'one', 'run', 'Father', 'Chu', 'emotional', 'level', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'other', 'areas', 'where', 'film', 'not', 'succeed.Pacing', 'inconsistency', 'underdeveloped', 'center', 'are', 'what', 'hurt', 'film', 'long', 'run', 'Lee', 'built', 'structure', 'film', 'creating', 'powerful', 'beginning', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'conclusion', 'what', 'middle', 'nothing', 'leftovers', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'inconsistent', 'jumping', 'one', 'unsuspecting', 'emotion', 'next', 'finally', 'reach', 'one', 'true', 'moment', 'due', 'part', 'Lee', 'direction', 'When', 'first', 'started', 'film', 'felt', 'story', 'camera', 'direction', 'were', 'tight', 'was', 'flowing', 'very', 'well', 'attention', 'was', 'focused', 'directly', 'film', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'found', 'eyes', 'wandering', 'felt', 'less', 'connected', 'characters', 'stumbled', 'lives', 'love', 'Suddenly', 'was', 'Lee', 'had', 'awakened', 'style', 'power', 'was', 'reinstated', 'last', 'couple', 'scenes', 'was', 'only', 'complaint', 'film', 'needed', 'more', 'structure', 'development', 'center', 'could', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'ending', 'never', 'happened.Overall', 'Lee', 'did', 'average', 'job', 'film', 'pure', 'talent', 'seen', 'later', 'films', 'one', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'arms', 'middle', 'film', 'would', 'suggest', 'least', 'one', 'viewing', 'are', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'fan', 'definatly', 'not', 'second.Grade', '**', '****']",N/A

153073,A15S44J4NHU4LS,079284548X,"Alvin Tanhehco ""kerki""","[1, 1]","This film is set in Taipei, and is spoken in Mandarin.  The opening scene of this movie shows Master Chef Chu at work in his own kitchen at home in preparation for ""the Sunday dinner.""  (My mouth was watering after the first 5 minutes.)  It's a ritual in the Chu family for the [widowed] father to get together with his three daughters for this weekly meal no matter how tight the schedules of or how unwilling the daughters are to come.  The eldest daughter is a devout Christian and high school chemistry teacher. The second daughter is an airline executive and the youngest daughter is a fast food chain cashier.All three daughters aren't married and aren't in any serious relationships at the beginning of the story.  But as the movie progresses and each of them find love under the strangest of circumstances, each has an ""announcement"" to make around the dinner table come Sunday.  The audience can't help but feel bad for the father who's getting old and seems to be at odds with her daughters for every small matter.Each daughter's relationship reflects the uniqueness of individuals.The eldest daughter wants to believe that her life is destined to be spent taking care of their father.  And so she remains unattached 9 years after her relationship in college.  As a teacher she develops a crush for a new volleyball coach at her school.  That's where her story takes off.The second daughter, in my opinion, gets a lion share of the attention in this film.  She seems to be the glue of the family.  At a young age, she mastered all there was to know in the kitchen, and so her father had to intentionally force her out of the kitchen so that she can make something out of her life.  This is very chinese for a parent not to want their children to go through the same hardships and career they themselves did.  To Chef Chu, a life in the kitchen is a worker's life; not an educated one he wants his daughter to lead.  As a talented and very pretty account executive, she is in line for a promotion that will take her to Amsterdam.  At first she hesitates because she had just bought an apartment at a new highrise building (but that turned out to be a scam).  Then later on because she needed to help her father out a bit.  Her relationship with a former boyfriend turns cold when he announces that he's getting married but wouldn't mind having her on the side.  A co-worker she is attracted to has a wife and children the US.  It seems that she is the one destined to look after her father.  She loves him so much.  But sometimes, in the course of loving another person you alienate them.  It's very poignantly captured in this film.The youngest daughter shows her naivete and innocence when she tries to cheer up a girl friend's suitor and ends up falling in love with him thinking her friend didn't like the guy anymore (her friend was playing hard-to-get a little bit too hard to begin with).The important theme to this story is hinted at when the father repeats to his daughters that he has lost his taste a long time ago.  The audience later knows that he was referring more to his taste for life rather than his physical inability to distinguish flavors.  This lack of appreciation for life comes with age as well as his loneliness from accepting the inevitable -- that his daughters are going to leave him alone someday.There are so many subtleties this film is able to capture about not only the Chinese culture but living with women in general.  (I grew up in a household where I was the only male, and I know what the father must have gone through each day.)I highly, highly recommend this film.  As an added incentive, I intentionally left out the surprise ending hinted at on the back cover, as well as other minor details.

Salama,"[1, 1]","When this movie was released in the 1990s I like it a lot; it's about three Taiwanese sisters (whose age range from the early thirties to the late teens) living in Taipei with their widowed father, a famous chef who has lost his sense of taste. All the three sisters are single, so a major theme of the plot is about their relationships (or lack of) with men. The most interesting of the three is in my opinion the older and plainer sister, who works as a teacher and is a practicing Christian. She is the most emotionally troubled of the three (though nothing really serious happen to her of to anybody in the film) and is played by Yang Kuei Mei (who would later play many risky roles in Tsai Ming Liang's movies). The middle sister is a young executive in some corporation while the younger sister seems to be still in high school. Seeing it now, I can see the movie is nothing spectacular, but is pleasing and well filmed by Ang Lee (Chinese food and its preparation is a motif of the movie, though it's not what I find particularly interesting about the film)",4,Crowd pleaser from Ang Lee,1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,1064,"['When', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1990s', 'like', 'lot', 'three', 'Taiwanese', 'sisters', 'age', 'range', 'early', 'thirties', 'late', 'teens', 'living', 'Taipei', 'widowed', 'father', 'famous', 'chef', 'who', 'lost', 'sense', 'taste', 'three', 'sisters', 'are', 'single', 'major', 'theme', 'plot', 'relationships', 'lack', 'men', 'most', 'interesting', 'three', 'opinion', 'older', 'plainer', 'sister', 'who', 'teacher', 'practicing', 'Christian', 'most', 'emotionally', 'troubled', 'three', 'nothing', 'really', 'serious', 'happen', 'anybody', 'film', 'played', 'Yang', 'Kuei', 'Mei', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'play', 'many', 'risky', 'roles', 'Tsai', 'Ming', 'Liang', 'movies', 'middle', 'sister', 'young', 'executive', 'corporation', 'younger', 'sister', 'be', 'still', 'high', 'school', 'Seeing', 'now', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'nothing', 'spectacular', 'pleasing', 'well', 'filmed', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'Chinese', 'food', 'preparation', 'motif', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'find', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'film']",N/A
153076,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,079284548X,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","This beautifully restrained glance at Chinese culture is brought to us by the same man who brought us films like `The Ice Storm', `Sense and Sensibility' and `Brokeback Mountain'.  Yes, Ang Lee, the master of diversity (his films have such range) offers probably his quietist film in `Eat Drink Man Woman', and yet it still packs a massive punch.This tale told is that of an aging chef named Mr. Chu who is raising his three daughters on his own.  His youngest daughter, Jia-Ning, is caught in an unexpected romance with a young man who is seeking the attentions of her best friend.  His eldest daughter, Jia-Jen, is a teacher who is harboring a nine-year secret and overwhelming love that got away that has haunted her life and dampened her love life.  His middle child, Jia-Chien, seems to have everything together.  She purchased an apartment, she has a free-spirited relationship with an ex and she has a very good job with the opportunity of promotion lingering over her head.  Sadly, things are not always as they appear, and as the film progresses we see the cracks in her perfect armor.The brilliance of `Eat Drink Man Woman' is in the subtlety.  Everything moves at such a fluid yet peaceful pace.  There is no melodrama, but everything feels organic and natural.  The performances are outstanding all around, with Chien-lien Wu stirring so many emotions in me with her delicate handling of every new development in Jia-Chien's life.Ang Lee has so many treasures in his filmography, and this is one of his finest moments.",5,"Lover's quarrels, love triangles and loving despairs...",1380758400,"10 3, 2013",2013,1530,"['beautifully', 'restrained', 'glance', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'brought', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'brought', 'films', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'Sense', 'Sensibility', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Yes', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'master', 'diversity', 'films', 'have', 'such', 'range', 'probably', 'quietist', 'film', 'Eat', 'Drink', 'Man', 'Woman', 'yet', 'still', 'massive', 'punch.This', 'tale', 'told', 'aging', 'chef', 'named', 'Mr.', 'Chu', 'who', 'raising', 'three', 'daughters', 'own', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Jia-Ning', 'caught', 'unexpected', 'romance', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'seeking', 'attentions', 'best', 'friend', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'Jia-Jen', 'teacher', 'who', 'harboring', 'nine-year', 'secret', 'overwhelming', 'love', 'got', 'away', 'haunted', 'life', 'dampened', 'love', 'life', 'middle', 'child', 'Jia-Chien', 'have', 'everything', 'together', 'purchased', 'apartment', 'free-spirited', 'relationship', 'ex', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'opportunity', 'promotion', 'lingering', 'head', 'Sadly', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'appear', 'film', 'see', 'cracks', 'perfect', 'armor.The', 'brilliance', 'Eat', 'Drink', 'Man', 'Woman', 'subtlety', 'Everything', 'moves', 'fluid', 'yet', 'peaceful', 'pace', 'melodrama', 'everything', 'feels', 'organic', 'natural', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Chien-lien', 'Wu', 'stirring', 'so', 'many', 'emotions', 'delicate', 'handling', 'new', 'development', 'Jia-Chien', 'life.Ang', 'Lee', 'so', 'many', 'treasures', 'filmography', 'one', 'finest', 'moments']",N/A

Here, he plays retired (only somewhat it turns out) hotel chef ""Master Chu.""  As in the other parts, the movie centers on the father's changing role in dealing with his offspring.  Here, he deals with his three adult and - as the story breaks - unmarried daughters trying to find their way in life.There are brilliant insights here into Chinese culture as well as depictions of parent-adult child friction and misunderstanding that will resonate with anyone, regardless of culture.My only (slight) criticism of the film is that at almost two hours and ten minutes, I felt like the story could have used a little tighter trimming in the editing room.

It's one of the most interesting movies I've seen despite the marathon of cooking dead animals. The three sisters bring life to the subplots. They somewhat mesh it all together as one whole with the father holding the tie. In a way, there is the suspense factor to be anticipated in the end and then comes the twist that I never saw coming. Great performances by everybody in the cast. Really good stuff. Of course, Eat Drink Man Woman reminds me of another film called Like Water for Chocolate which is the more superior film due to its perfect blending of food and love. Eat Drink Man Woman is like that too but on a somber note. It's amusing to note the more cooking goes on, the better the film is. And in Eat Drink Man Woman, I feel like none of them is edible to me, no matter how colorful they look. Of course, that's the Taiwanese culture. Even funnier is how every time one of the three sisters meets a man, she suddenly leaves the house. When the father comes to save the day at the restaurant, there is a Goodfellas feeling about similar to the moment that Ray Liotta goes in the back way with Lorraine Bracco. Very good stuff.

Erland,"[1, 2]","Note: Chinese with English subtitles.Chinese, widowed father and professional chef Tao Chu (Sihung Lung) cooks a sumptous meal every Sunday evening for his three grown, single daughters who still live at home whether they want it or not. Though retired, he also continues to help out at a prestigious restaurant when his expertise is required. The strange thing about all this food preparation is the fact that Tao has lost his sense of taste since his wife's death and cannot truly enjoy his wonderful culinary creations.The only real familial interaction takes place around the dinnertable and even there the communication is poor. Tao is a private man who expresses his love in the preparation of the meal. His daughter's Jia-Jen (Kuei-Mei-Yang), Jia-Chen (Chien-Lein Wu) and Jia-Ning (Yu-Wen Wang) don't appreciate their Father's efforts and can't wait to find husbands and move out.As the story progresses they all find their own way in life and one by one move out. Unexpected by the daughter's, their Father has also been active and finds a young wife and a new life.Beautiful poetic story, in an almost flawless production. In the end when his daughter Jia-Chen prepares a meal for her Father he miraculously rediscovers his taste buds. Touching, emotionally understated ending like most Asian films are.

All I have ever seen of Japan and China has been through the eyes of Bruce Lee, Jet Li and Akira Kurosawa films.  So when I  have the opportunity to watch a movie that is not only well made but gives  me the opportunity to learn more about such a far away and different  culture, I jump at it.  This was such a film.Let me first applaud the  acting, especially by Mr. Lung (Mr. Chu) and Ms. Wu (Jia-Chien).  They were  not only convincing, but seductive in their roles.  The story was realistic  and, contrary to reviews by Leonard Maltin, was unpredictable.  Who could  have guessed the way the story would unwind, to the final Sunday dinner.What I found most engaging about the film was the character Jia-Chien.  Her relationship with her family was complex.  Lack of communication with  her older sister led their love to become buried in angst and confusion.  And although she set out to become a successful business woman, she  struggled to find balance between her work and her love of cooking and her  father.  It became apparent to me that she was her fathers favorite  daughter, and their apprehension toward showing their feelings was clouded  by their lives outside the family, until they came to accept each  other.The only other film about Chinese culture (not martial arts) that  I have seen is Joy Luck Club, and although this did not feature the same  level of drama and pain, I enjoyed it just as much.

Don't get me wrong, Tortilla Soup by itself is a fine film.  Howeverit would be difficult for any director to top Eat Drink Man Woman and the remake suffers in comparison.  It is in Chinese with subtitles or dubbed.The film starts with the patriarch of the family, cooking a meal for the traditional Sunday dinner, what one daughter refers to as the Sunday Family torture ritual.  It seems a hushed and strained affair and you aren't certain how close the family is.The scene where he makes the meal is interesting in itself because his character is one of the top chefs in Taiwan and if gives you a view of chinese cooking you've never seen in the resterant. However the real interesting dynamic in the film is between he and his three daughters. They do not talk and their main interaction is at these Sunday meals, where not much conversation occures.  The oldest daughter is a stern, slightly humorless, teacher who has not looked at a man since having her heart broken in college.  The middle daughter is a beautiful and quite sucessfull exectutive for the national airline.  The youngest is a sweet college student working part time at MacDonalds.The scenes Alternate between humorous, such as when a friends child trades the inedible lunch her mother tries to make everyday for one made by the man she merely thinks of as her neighbor, not knowing she is eating dishes that would cost a fortune for lunch in her grammer school, or when the younger daughter, sees her friend treating a boy badly and sets her sights on him, to touching, such as when the middle daughter, angry that her father made her go to college instead of being a chef realizes that she cares about him much more than she ever knew.The changes that come over each of the characters, from the blossoming of the older daughter, the softening of the middle daughter and a suprising end with the youngest will keep you laughing and engaged in this movie.If you've loved Ang Lee's other movies, Sense and Senseability, Crouching Tiger, Hidding Dragon, the Wedding Banquet and Pushing Hands, you are depriving yourself of a truley wonderful movie experience if you haven't seen Eat Drink Man Woman.

I first saw it on Netflix, it recommended this movie based on me giving The Joy Luck Club five stars (LOL), it was a completely different movie altogether though,  but whatever, I am not going to give a comparison to the movies - it has nothing to do with this movie.I loved the movie so much when I saw it on Netflix that I bought it on Amazon.  Anyway, the movie is entirely in Mandarian Chinese, with English subtitles.  It was filmed in Taiwan.  Some ramblings of another reviewer kept going on and on about Tortilla Soup - to that, I want to say this, that mediocre film Tortilla Soup was a remake of THIS movie!  Just because you saw that movie first doesn't mean it was made first; this movie was made in 1994 (hello! you do the math!) - I just had to get that off my chest because I mean, really, when they remade it, they didn't even bother changing the script!  Talk about plagiarism!Anyhoo, this is a great movie to show Chinese culture, for those of you who are curious - or who love movies (like me) of ethnic cultures (like Moonstruck, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Fiddler on the Roof, etc.).  I loved the movie so much I didn't even care that I had to read the subtitles, it didn't take away from the brilliance of the movie at all... I think it was the fact that my mouth was watering so much!This is the BEST movie that shows Chinese culture via food - just so you know, the movie starts off with the father, a master chef in Taiwan, Mr. Chu, making the ritual Sunday family dinner.  The five minute filming of the beginning of the film where it shows such a detailed cooking is so rich, and makes you sooo HUNGRY!

This, his third film directing and God knows where on the list of producer, is a gem.Frankly I don't see the necessity for this film to have been remade, which it was, as the dreary TORTILLA SOUP--written and produced by Lee.As I have reviewed few of these films (the wife's favorite is JOY LUCK CLUB 1993, mine is DIM SUM: A LITTLE BIT OF HEART 1985, both directed by Wayne Wang who is perhaps superior to Lee), I picked YIN SHI NAN NU, ""EAT DRINK, MAN WOMAN"" as my favorite to review.

A dear friend of theirs from childhood, Jin-Rong (Silvia Chang) gives this film an unexpected spice which I will not spoil.By the way, if you are a fan of Wang's films and certainly if you've seen enough of Jackie Chan's stuff, you'll recognize every single actor here. Don't worry about names. They can give anyone a migraine--I always prefer to see the names in Chinese.The girls are weary of their lives. One is a major airline exec, one is a high-ranking teacher and one a student or...something, I can't tell with her. The youngest is 20, so they are not exactly old maids, except in Chinese culture of course.This is the story of a gentle but emotionally suppressed elderly man who can cook like no one, but can't talk to his girls. The girls are each out of whack by more than a few ts'un (a Chinese unit of measurement)--they can't even seem to talk to each other and it gets worse when two of them have a tiff over the same boy.The film is a nice, meditative roller coaster. If that sounds funny, don't look at me: Ang Lee is the chef perfecting this dish! It smells as well as looks like pure Taiwanese culture, and this film makes me want to eat a horse every time I see it. There are bumps along the way, but in the end, everyone is happy. You might even shed a tear of joy for them all, as I first did. And, boy, does Old Mr. Chu shock the hell out of everyone at the end...and this will make you laugh til you're sore.It is this wonderful new spice in the stew that I am not revealing. Get and cherish this fantastic offering of the best in Chinese film...and find out for yourself.Now if only someone would sell me PUSHING HANDS at a reasonable cost!!",4,"Paging Ang Lee, Your 1,000-year old duck is ready",1274745600,"05 25, 2010",2010,2952,"['surprising', 'see', 'how', 'little', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'done', 'years', ""'m"", 'veteran', 'admirer', 'first', 'films', 'TUI', 'SHOU', 'PUSHING', 'HANDS', '1992', 'XI', 'YAN', 'WEDDING', 'BANQUET', '1993', 'SENSE', 'AND', 'SENSIBILITY', '1995', 'THE', 'ICE', 'STORM', '1997', 'BROKEBACK', 'MOUNTAIN', '2005', 'more', 'third', 'film', 'directing', 'God', 'where', 'list', 'producer', 'gem.Frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'necessity', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'remade', 'was', 'dreary', 'TORTILLA', 'SOUP', 'written', 'produced', 'Lee.As', 'have', 'reviewed', 'few', 'films', 'wife', 'favorite', 'JOY', 'LUCK', 'CLUB', '1993', 'mine', 'DIM', 'SUM', 'LITTLE', 'BIT', 'OF', 'HEART', '1985', 'directed', 'Wayne', 'Wang', 'who', 'perhaps', 'superior', 'Lee', 'picked', 'YIN', 'SHI', 'NAN', 'NU', 'EAT', 'DRINK', 'MAN', 'WOMAN', 'favorite', 'review', 'Lee', '1994', 'offering', 'classic', 'as', 'classy', 'get', 'ever', 'would', 'get', 'again.My', 'perennial', 'favorite', 'old', 'days', 'top', 'actor', 'martial', 'arts', 'master', 'Sihung', 'Lung', 'Mr.', 'Chu', 'widower', 'major', 'chef', 'Lung', 'also', 'played', 'great', ""T'ai"", 'Ch', 'i', 'Master', 'Chu', 'contempo-set', 'PUSHING', 'HANDS', 'film', 'oddly', 'enough', 'impossible', 'get', 'sane', 'price', 'See', 'review', 'Old', 'Chu', 'regular', 'Sunday', 'dinners', 'three', 'adult', 'daughters', 'Jia-Ning', 'Yu-Wei', 'Wang', 'Jia-Chen', 'Chien-lien', 'Wu', 'Jia-Jen', 'Kuei-Mei', 'Yang', 'dear', 'friend', 'theirs', 'childhood', 'Jin-Rong', 'Silvia', 'Chang', 'film', 'unexpected', 'spice', 'will', 'not', 'spoil.By', 'way', 'are', 'fan', 'Wang', 'films', 'certainly', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'enough', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'stuff', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'single', 'actor', 'here', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'names', 'can', 'give', 'anyone', 'migraine', 'always', 'prefer', 'see', 'names', 'Chinese.The', 'girls', 'are', 'weary', 'lives', 'One', 'major', 'airline', 'exec', 'one', 'high-ranking', 'teacher', 'one', 'student', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'youngest', '20', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'old', 'maids', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'course.This', 'story', 'gentle', 'emotionally', 'suppressed', 'elderly', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'cook', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'girls', 'girls', 'are', 'whack', 'more', 'few', ""ts'un"", 'Chinese', 'unit', 'measurement', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'seem', 'talk', 'other', 'worse', 'when', 'two', 'have', 'tiff', 'same', 'boy.The', 'film', 'nice', 'meditative', 'roller', 'coaster', 'funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'chef', 'perfecting', 'dish', 'as', 'well', 'looks', 'pure', 'Taiwanese', 'culture', 'film', 'want', 'eat', 'horse', 'time', 'see', 'are', 'bumps', 'way', 'end', 'everyone', 'happy', 'might', 'even', 'shed', 'tear', 'joy', 'first', 'did', 'boy', 'Old', 'Mr.', 'Chu', 'shock', 'hell', 'everyone', 'end', 'will', 'make', 'til', ""'re"", 'sore.It', 'wonderful', 'new', 'spice', 'stew', 'am', 'not', 'revealing', 'Get', 'cherish', 'fantastic', 'offering', 'best', 'Chinese', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'yourself.Now', 'only', 'someone', 'would', 'sell', 'PUSHING', 'HANDS', 'reasonable', 'cost']",N/A

153093,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,079284548X,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[8, 8]","This film is a feast for the eyes and senses. It will have almost *all* viewers drooling with delight and desire as Mr. Chen prepares his ritual Sunday meal for his three grown daughters and occasionally a friend and neighbor. Mr. Chen is a widower, a retired chef from a famous Chinese restaurant in Taiwan. He continues this traditional family gathering as a way of communicating his love for his daughters. As a Chinese male and head of household, it is awkward for him to express his true feelings without a mother figure in the house. The problem is - his daughters are adults and each has her own unique identity. Each of them needs to grow in her own directon and express her own individuality - this is when the fun really begins, as one by one in the film, the viewer is privileged to learn about the daughters' lives. Little does Mr. Chen realize just how modern his obedient daughters are and just exactly what events are transpiring behind the scenes in their lives to which he is *not* privvy ... until ...one by one their lives are revealed to his surprise. However, what is really amazing is - Mr. Chen is more modern than his *own* daughters realize and he has a few tricks up his sleeve which catch them unaware as well!There are many wonderful themes explored in this complex film which to be fully appreciated should be viewed several times for maximum enjoyment. There is love, hope, survival, lonliness, friendship, death, betrayal, family values, and so much more. There is so much depth to this film  that a lot can and likely will be missed, despite the fact it is a two hour film, it zooms by very fast. Mr. Chen's role is much deeper than one realizes, so the unfocused mind is overwhelmed by sensual data. Truly, several viewings will be needed and this is realized *only* after having viewed the film two or three times. The eldest and most beautiful daughter is a company executive for an airline. She is highly successful and offered a promotion to become a Vice President for the firm but it involves moving to the Amsterdam office. She is a modern career woman and carrying on an affair with a free-spirited Chinese artist. Little does she know what tricks her boyfriend has in store for her while she plays the role of single successful woman. Her life seems the most on track and  the film reveals just how much of an illusion this viewpoint is. The middle daughter is more plain looking. She graduated with a college major in chemistry and teaches at a local boy's high school. She uses religion as an escape and became a Christian. She listens to Christian hymns even when waiting for the bus and traveling to and from work. Her ""old maid"" status is not lost on her teenaged male students who play a practical joke on her which went overboard and caused her great embarrassment. Amazingly enough, the new boy's volleyball coach greets the chemistry teacher and asks her to attend the team's games. He rides a motor cycle and is very cool. She does not know what to make of his overtures. It is when the students in her chemistry class play the practical joke on her that Chou Ming Dao, the coach comes to her rescue and a different kind of *chemistry* occurs between them. Something magical and unexpected develops. The middle plain daughter engages in uncharacteristic behaviors but due to her Christian beliefs, she follows her heart as well as the tenets of her faith but the outcome is totally unpredictable. She shocks her family with her announcement at the Sunday traditional family meal ... The third daughter is the youngest. She works at fast food restaurant and unlike her older sisters shows no promise to become college educated. She has a best friend whose boyfriend keeps hanging around the restaurant. The friend indicates she is making her boyfriend suffer and she feigns not being interested in him, very convincingly so. The youngest daughter advises the young man on love and matters of the heart, to the point of his realizing *she* is a better catch than his original love. There are many unpredictable twists and turns in the plot as each daughter works out her life circumstances based on her own interests and values ...Meanwhile they are hoping that their dad will get together with Jin Rong's mother who returned to Taiwan after living in the USA. Jin Rong is a pretty young neighbor who is undergoing a divorce from her husband who cheated by having an affair. Her mother is returned to live with her and help raise Shan Shan her school aged daughter. Her mother could not get used to the culture shock of her other daughter having married outside the Chinese culture. It is quite clear, Jin Rong's mother has designs on Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen's daughters are encouraging these feelings. Mr. Chen pulls off one of the biggest unexpected and unpredictable surprise endings which truly makes this film one of the best I have viewed in a long time. This is a most highly recommended film.

153097,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,079284548X,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[5, 6]","This Taiwanese film is fascinating. It shows us the traditional Chinese culture in Taiwan as it is surviving in the restaurant industry. This food has become a blend of all Chinese traditions, which is of course a great evolution, but it remains an essential part of Chinese culture in Taiwan, against the westernization of life in this island. But it is centered on one man, the father, his three daughters and a few other women. It is the story of these women confronted to the evolution of their society, particularly confronted to divorce, which is not a Chinese tradition, and love for women, which is not exactly a tradition either. Taiwanese society is changing very fast and this film concentrates the vision on women's feeling and consciousness. This is a drastic change in Chinese culture in which women were secondary. This leads to a daughter looking after her father at the end, which is a complete reversal of the tradition. As such this film is a great and important milestone in the evolution of Chinese culture as confronted to western influence. It sure depicts Taiwan, but this can easily be extended to continental China, particularly to the big cities of continental China, and it shows how far and fast this culture that is four or five thousand years old has changed and is changing. In half a century some traditions have completely been put upside down. The film is also very interesting because it shows how this evolution is not the direct result of westernization, but rather of the natural evolution of any society that is not frozen : women have to capture a position of importance and they do so because society at large needs them in the economic field. What's more the rhythm of the film is very Chinese indeed, taking time to show details and lingering on some of these sentimental and personal elements. It does not reduce this evolution to a fast passing vision, but it delves into the deep meaning of it and gives us a very humane and attractive picture.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan",5,Women and their future in Chinese culture,1050192000,"04 13, 2003",2003,2037,"['Taiwanese', 'film', 'fascinating', 'traditional', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'Taiwan', 'surviving', 'restaurant', 'industry', 'food', 'become', 'blend', 'Chinese', 'traditions', 'course', 'great', 'evolution', 'essential', 'part', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'Taiwan', 'westernization', 'life', 'island', 'centered', 'one', 'man', 'father', 'three', 'daughters', 'few', 'other', 'women', 'story', 'women', 'confronted', 'evolution', 'society', 'particularly', 'confronted', 'divorce', 'not', 'Chinese', 'tradition', 'love', 'women', 'not', 'exactly', 'tradition', 'either', 'Taiwanese', 'society', 'changing', 'very', 'fast', 'film', 'vision', 'women', 'feeling', 'consciousness', 'drastic', 'change', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'women', 'were', 'secondary', 'daughter', 'looking', 'father', 'end', 'complete', 'reversal', 'tradition', 'such', 'film', 'great', 'important', 'milestone', 'evolution', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'confronted', 'western', 'influence', 'sure', 'Taiwan', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'extended', 'continental', 'China', 'particularly', 'big', 'cities', 'continental', 'China', 'how', 'far', 'fast', 'culture', 'four', 'five', 'thousand', 'years', 'old', 'changed', 'changing', 'century', 'traditions', 'have', 'completely', 'been', 'put', 'upside', 'down', 'film', 'also', 'very', 'interesting', 'how', 'evolution', 'not', 'direct', 'result', 'westernization', 'rather', 'natural', 'evolution', 'society', 'not', 'frozen', 'women', 'have', 'capture', 'position', 'importance', 'do', 'so', 'society', 'large', 'needs', 'economic', 'field', 'What', 'more', 'rhythm', 'film', 'very', 'Chinese', 'indeed', 'taking', 'time', 'show', 'details', 'lingering', 'sentimental', 'personal', 'elements', 'not', 'reduce', 'evolution', 'fast', 'passing', 'vision', 'deep', 'meaning', 'very', 'humane', 'attractive', 'picture.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Perpignan']",N/A

I like foreign movies because most of them do not follow the Hollywood standard of relying heavily on famous movie stars to make cash for the studios at the sacrifice of a good plot, skillful acting, and good storytelling.This movie is a slice of Taiwanese life. Master Chu is a renowned chef and a widower who raised three beautiful daughters. The movie observes the lives of the members of this family and the people around them. The storytelling is simple and sweet. Ang Lee has us observing the character's lives as forces around them change the circumstances they find each other in. The film is engrossing and satisfying as we watch the conflict of tradition and modernization affect Master Chu and his loved ones.

The work lives, interpersonal lives, and spiritual lives of four main characters are explored and interwoven, with the Sunday dinner table being the terminus at which they all meet and from which we switch characters and depart on the continuing exploration of each person's life.  Each of the main character's lives would be interesting enough for its own full-length movie; so together they keep you thinking and interested from opening to closing credits.  In this masterful cultural portrait of the balanced interplay between life and death, work and love, family and self, food and deprivation, Ang Lee allows us to see and experience the intimate details of a major world culture, which is vastly different from our own in the western world.  The popular theme of traditional Chinese culture being impacted by modern life is addressed in a more realistic, less overdone, manner than in many movies, and the multi-generational presentation of interwoven lives makes it more easily understandable and complete.

Oh, well, sticks and stones, and all that.Widower and Master Chef Chu lives in Taipei with his three unattached daughters, Jia-Ning (the youngest), Jia-Chien, and Jia-Jen (the oldest). Chu lives to cook, principally as Head Chef in a prestigious city hotel, but also for his family. Indeed, the only contact he has with his offspring is over the gargantuan, gourmet meal he cooks every Sunday. Even then, however, familial interaction is at a minimum, and should a daughter reveal an important event in her life with the declaration, &quot;I have an announcement&quot;, there's no subsequent discussion or paternal interest. As for himself, aging Chu is losing zest for life. Even his sense of taste is fading. Meanwhile, his daughters are looking for love.Jia-Jen, still traumatized from being dumped years previous, teaches chemistry at a men's college, and otherwise finds solace in a Christian brotherhood. Jia-Ning works at a Wendy's (yup, that American fast-food Wendy's), and thinks her best friend's boyfriend is hot. Jia-Chien, an up and coming international airline executive, is attracted to the company's new business negotiator. Trouble is, he's the one that broke Jia-Jen's heart.I mentioned to my wife that one of the best things about foreign films is the chance to see places we're likely never to visit, e.g. Taipei, Taiwan. Moreover, she responded, one sees that life elsewhere is pretty much like life over here. (I guess the Wendy's made a big impression.) Maybe that's my problem with the film. Though the acting is consistently excellent, and all the daughters pretty and worthy of audience sympathy, the movie as a whole, while congenial enough and providing a few chuckles, wasn't notably dramatic, humorous, or clever. I might as well have been spying on the mundane lives of the next door neighbors. Building a story around food has been done before, albeit with other cuisines.  Even towards the film's end, when Old Dad chimes in with his own surprising &quot;I have an announcement&quot;, the stir it causes passes swiftly. And his lack of overt connection with his daughters is like an airless vacuum. Only at the very end, with Jia-Chien, does his reserve crack a tiny bit. I wanted more of an emotional catharsis.The best part of EAT, DRINK, MAN, WOMAN is the food. The scenes of Chu preparing his gourmet delicacies, blessedly without a single fortune cookie in sight, approach being fascinating.

and sex' are the only desires we human beings are interested. after you've been fed satisfactorily and got the energy, the next thing you naturally could and would think about is, well, SEX. that's why confucius said, 'eat, drink and sex are the only desires and lust where peoples' minds are setting upon.'but not in this mis-interpretated movie.in this movie we saw a papa-san chef retired from grand hotle, taipei, taiwan, doing a daily gourmet cooking ritual so complicated out of a barrenly equipped family kitchen, that's first thing totally impossible! how could he afford buying so many food and ingredients and doing it in that specific tough and  poor era?the 2nd ridiculous fatal flaw was that this retired chef obviously stole a lot of cooking wares and expensive table wares from grand hotel before he retired.did you notice that he got all the complete sets of commercial cooking utensils? the complete expensive commercial standard matching plates, soup bowls, rice bowls, saucers, cups, even chopsticks?the problems of ang lee's production group was that they totally overlooked the logic, the possibility and the feasibility of convincing a thinking viewer to accept such poor arrangement. you  simply could not just borrowed so many things directly from the grand hotel's restaurant and let those stuff show up in the retired chef's home and made him look like a master thief committed grand theft.how could a guy owned so many expensive and complete sets of commercial stuff? did grand hotel ever discover how many items were missing? if the pilferage was so serious, then why nobody ever noticed, not even his 4 daughters?how could this old chef snatched so many huge items from the hotel's restaurant kitchen to his home kitchen was beyond my imagination. obviously he's not just a great chef, he's also definitely a master thief.ang lee directed this movie just based upon the face value of these 4 chinese words was only a proof that his interpretation of the chinese culture is so wrong and so shallow, just like his choice of making the 'the crouching tiger and the hidden dragon'.since the story he picked to make it into movie was actually the worst part of the whole saga. that part was long after the author quitted writing of this novel, and then had to do it again by hooking up from the ending of his last famous and successful novel to cash in more easily and faster (just like so many famous american writers). because he became so poor after quitted writing, he needed the money to pay the debt and to make a barely affordable living, he then quickly wrote this totally unnecesary sequel--the worst part of the saga--that almost ruined his whole achievement.this sequal had turned all the great depth of the former hero and heroine into helpless wimps and allowed the ruthless and conscience-less new heroine to mess up and turned everything upside down.it's so ironic that the author would have chosen in such way to finish his great work of pre-modern-day chinese literature in a 180 degrees turnaround, and pathetically picked up by ang lee again later into a mindless chinese wu-shiah movie.",4,2 things to remind you

Seeing the film in it's original language creates more drama and sympathy for the father who is a chef and no longer has his sense of taste and his three daughters that suffer from a boring routine schedule of a full plate of work and even more plates of food. One daughter is a student the other a teacher and the eldest is a hard working executive.Raising three daughters is hard for a widower and being raised by a widower is even harder. The story is set when everyone starts getting a life and they're all worried about how the change is going to effect the family but the one who you would expect to care most doesn't. Dad takes the change ok because of the recent lost of his best friend who worked as his taste buds when he lost his own.Things start to get more complicated as both daughters fall in love with co-workers and the youngest falls for her best friends boyfriend. Through all of these complications they still make it home for a big dinner not prepared to the fullest thanks to their father not being able to tell if the taste is right. The biggest surprise and twist is their father has been keeping a huge secret from his family and another family.

153115,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,079284548X,Marc Cabir Davis,"[7, 8]","MGM's horrendous DVD releases of late are all forgiven when you take one look at the sparkling release that is 'Yin Shi Nan Nu' (aka 'Eat Drink Man Woman'), a 1994 Taiwanese film that is gaining renewed recognition, mainly because its from the same person who directed 'Wo Hu Cang Long' (aka 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon'). Of all the food-themed movies on DVD thus far, this is definitely my favorite, and while not as layered and grippingly bizarre as its' Japanese counterpart 'Tampopo', it does have its' moments, and the fitting climax ties in very neatly with the plotline.Ang Lee is a truly gifted film-maker, and this is most evident in his Chinese-language work. I shudder to think that hes actually gone and accepted a big studio's proposal to direct 'The Hulk'. Lee's work in the early 1990s, such as this little gem, is well worth investing in. Personally, I find movies of this sort well worth watching - in fact, I've watched this film four times in two different countries and each time realize how it stands the test of time.The storyline is simple - a master chef widower lives in a big house with his three daughters - one is an executive, another is a teacher, the last is a high school student. The film attempts to tie together all their love-lives, a plot that could go horribly wrong and could look tedious, in the wrong hands. Fortunately, Lee refrains from overtures such as the lush but irritating ones sported by 'The Scent of Green Papaya', and handles this film with a great degree of respect for the medium, and respect for the audience.First off, this movie will probably sit best with lovers of Chinese food. The DVD quality enhances the picture - if you own the VHS version or saw the version broadcast by Bravo, you haven't seen the film at all. Colors are crisp and bright, and reds, greens and yellows jump off the screen with great joy. Watching the Chef Chu prepare his food is extremely delightful - and if you are a cook you may learn something new - but it could also lead to hunger pangs. Also, this is NOT the movie to watch if you're vegetarian - chinese cuisine in this movie leans heavily upon non-vegetarian items, so if you're into tofu and spring onions, you may want to pick up a copy of 'Chutney Mary' instead. 'Eat Drink Man Woman's kitchen scenes are overflowing with chicken, peking duck, szechuan lamb and succulent seafood. The banquet scenes are breathtaking, and the attention to preparation of the family dinners are sensational.Not many people know this, but 'Eat Drink Man Woman' is part of The Ang Lee Trilogy, which comprises of 'Pushing Hands', 'The Wedding Banquet' and this film. All these films have a 'father' theme, and the father in all the movies are played by the same gentleman, Sihung Lung. Its not especially great acting (Lung looks like hes playing the same father in all three movies, even though he IS supposed to be playing different characters) but the talented ensemble cast make all the difference.The film also introduces us to the Westernization of the Orient - Taiwan is indeed a beautiful place, and it also paints a charming picture of the Taiwanese school system. That a picture can address all these themes and still walk away successful, is testament to Ang Lee's brilliant direction and screenplay.On DVD, 'Eat Drink Man Woman' will probably never look better, unless of course its presented in a Superbit Collection, which may really never happen. The only problem I had with it is that theres not a whole lot of extra features. However, the main feature here is a new documentary with Ang Lee that goes on for nearly 20 minutes where he takes us through his creative process at the time. This is captivating, as Ang transports us back to 1994's Taiwan, and takes us on a tour of the film. I would recommend that you watch this documentary after you actually sit through the film as it helps you appreciate the movie a bit more.The other extra on the DVD is a trailer set for the film. These are not very special, and you can tell that they have aged. However, its great to have them available in any format, so I am glad. The best thing about the DVD then, is the movie itself. I am not sure that many Chinese language films have been given such excellent treatment by an American studio, considering that they almost never make a profit in the digital medium (unless of course its something as overpriced as 'In the mood for Love' which is fast becoming one of Criterion's bestselling discs this year). Time and time again, I was taken in by the beautiful hues and shades that have been brought to life once again on this DVD release.If you're a lover of world cinema, 'Eat Drink Man Woman' is certainly a film that you need to obtain on DVD. I prefer this to 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' and also 'The Wedding Banquet'. And considering that its being released at discount price to begin with, its obvious that its a great deal. If you are interested in the other films in this trilogy, you can currently get them only on VHS. It surprised me that 'Pushing Hands' was actually once released on DVD in the US, but is now out of print. And 'The Wedding Banquet' is also not available on DVD. Lets hope that MGM gets around to putting them on digital disc as soon as possible.All in all, this is a selection that is worthy of a place in a world cinema lover's library. It has immense repeat value, and you may pick up a few kitchen skills along the way!",5,A Day with Yin Shi Nan Nu,1017792000,"04 3, 2002",2002,5450,"['MGM', 'horrendous', 'DVD', 'releases', 'late',

Directed by Ang Lee, the film tells the story of Chu, a senior chef who has discovered that his tastebuds are starting to fail him. Chu has three daughters, all of whom still live with him. (Their mother passed away when they were growing up.) The eldest is a schoolteacher and is widely considered to be an old maid. Everyone expects her to never marry and spend her life taking care of her father. The middle child is a high-powered executive at an airline company. She's already put down money on her own apartment, and an offer to become a vice-president at her company may move her away even farther - to Amsterdam. The youngest daughter works at a fast food joint.Chu still expects all his daughters to arrive at home in time for Sunday dinner each week, an elaborate affair that he spends all day preparing for. The film allows us to sit in on Chu's family dinners, the venue of choice for the characters to make big announcements. Over the course of the family dinners, we watch as each of the daughters, and Chu himself, find their way in the world and make new lives for themselves.The most notable part of this film is watching Chu cook. The camera zooms in on intricate chopping, slicing, arranging, frying, and more. As you watch, you realize that Chinese cooking (and any cooking done with such precision) is truly an art. He slices vegetables with razor-like deft. He creates aesthetic towers of vegetables and proteins. He sets a gorgeous table that would feed an army. It is amazing to see. (And it will make you long for good Chinese food. Don't watch on an empty stomach.) In this sense, the film reminded me of Like Water for Chocolate, Big Night, and Babette's Feast. In many scenes, the food is the real star.The plot itself is also good, and I TOTALLY did not see the end coming.",4,Dinner with Chu,1202169600,"02 5, 2008",2008,1910,"['loved', 'movie', 'Eat', 'Drink', 'Man', 'Woman', 'Chinese', 'film', 'subtitles', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'scare', 'off', 'Directed', 'Ang', 'Lee', 'film', 'story', 'Chu', 'senior', 'chef', 'who', 'discovered', 'tastebuds', 'are', 'starting', 'fail', 'Chu', 'three', 'daughters', 'whom', 'still', 'live', 'mother', 'passed', 'away', 'when', 'were', 'growing', 'up', 'eldest', 'schoolteacher', 'widely', 'considered', 'be', 'old', 'maid', 'Everyone', 'never', 'marry', 'spend', 'life', 'taking', 'care', 'father', 'middle', 'child', 'high-powered', 'executive', 'airline', 'company', 'already', 'put', 'down', 'money', 'own', 'apartment', 'offer', 'become', 'vice-president', 'company', 'may', 'move', 'away', 'even', 'farther', 'Amsterdam', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'fast', 'food', 'joint.Chu', 'still', 'daughters', 'arrive', 'home', 'time', 'Sunday', 'dinner', 'week', 'elaborate', 'affair', 'day', 'preparing', 'film', 'sit', 'Chu', 'family', 'dinners', 'venue', 'choice', 'characters', 'make', 'big', 'announcements', 'course', 'family', 'dinners', 'watch', 'daughters', 'Chu', 'find', 'way', 'world', 'make', 'new', 'lives', 'themselves.The', 'most', 'notable', 'part', 'film', 'watching', 'Chu', 'cook', 'camera', 'intricate', 'chopping', 'slicing', 'arranging', 'frying', 'more', 'watch', 'realize', 'Chinese', 'cooking', 'cooking', 'done', 'such', 'precision', 'truly', 'art', 'vegetables', 'razor-like', 'deft', 'aesthetic', 'towers', 'vegetables', 'proteins', 'gorgeous', 'table', 'would', 'feed', 'army', 'amazing', 'see', 'will', 'make', 'long', 'good', 'Chinese', 'food', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'empty', 'stomach', 'sense', 'film', 'reminded', 'Water', 'Chocolate', 'Big', 'Night', 'Babette', 'Feast', 'many', 'scenes', 'food', 'real', 'star.The', 'plot', 'also', 'good', 'TOTALLY', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'end', 'coming']",N/A

The middle daughter is an airline executive  and the youngest is a burgr flipper at Wendy's when she isn't in school.  The emotional lives of everyone is seen in an extremely well done movie.  There are numerous lite moments as well as serious ones.  The chef cooks  school lunches for the daughter of his eldest daughter's friend and this  soon becomes a mob scene as all the kids in the class are placing orders  for lunch; one boy orders egg fried rice and is told, forget it, that is  too simple. Dad does the laundry and pulls a jumble of pantyhose and bras  out of the washer and tries to seperate one from the other and gives up.  I've been there so I know the feeling and it is a fine touch. All the  daughters meet men and ultimately become involved.  The middle daughter's  involvement is unusual as she is in the process of ending one relationship  when she meets a new person at work.

153125,A281NPSIMI1C2R,079284548X,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[3, 5]","Sunday dinner at master chef Chu's home resembles a spectacular banquet you would only expect at a gourmet restaurant. He works tirelessly to prepare a feast for his daughters who hardly seem to appreciate his culinary skills.Jia-Jen (Kuei-Mei-Yang) is a chemistry teacher who has discovered Christianity, Jia-Chen (Chien-Lien Wu), is an airline executive who is in love with a man who will never marry her and Jia-Ning (Yu-Wen Wang) has her eye on a friend?s boyfriend.The basic plot centers around a father who is not only trying to find a new life but is watching all his daughters leave and start their own lives.Indirectly we also learn a great deal about men through the relationships the daughters pursue. We have a man who is living the bachelor lifestyle, a naive lover who is just learning about the games women play and a man who is willing to change religions to get the girl of his dreams.This movie is deliciously dramatic with some deeply religious themes. I was pleasantly surprised with the light humor which was not at all offensive. You also see three lifestyles presented by the daughters showing how they each deal with their libidinous whims. The most unexpected twists and turns appear, making the plot entirely entertaining.While chef Chu finds ways to show his love to his daughters, he is especially estranged from one of his daughters who only communicates with him through criticism of his food. There is a scene later in the movie which shows the father using this same tactic to communicate his love to his daughter.Some of the comedy is all in the facial expressions. I especially loved the part where chef Chu is trying to eat the inedible lunch and where the children in his adopted granddaughter's classroom are all placing orders for lunch. As a woman, I could not help laughing when he pulls out the nylons and bras all tied up together in the washer.I?m always complaining about the lack of chef themes in movies. If you are hungry for movies with cooking themes, add this movie to your must-see menu. You almost have to watch this movie twice. Once with the subtitles and the second time just to view all the tantalizing dishes master chef Chu (Sihung Lung) prepares.This movie reminded me of ""The Scent of Green Papaya"" (1994). However, ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" excels in the presentation of the cuisine, while ""The Scent of Green Papaya"" was more poetic in its presentation. This movie is a visual feast. All I want to know now is where is the cookbook so I can learn how to make that dragon?Playful romance, creative cuisine, deep rivers of emotional drama and original comedy are the ingredients that make this movie a satisfying feast for the heart and soul.Three words to take Very Seriously ""before"" watching this movie: Order Chinese Food!Don't say we didn't warn you. ;)Also look for:Babette's Feast,Like Water for Chocolate,Simply IrresistibleandChocolat (Miramax Collector's Series).~The Rebecca Review",5,Tantalizing Cuisine and Family Drama in Taiwan,1058400000,"07 17, 2003",2003,2948,"['Sunday', 'dinner', 'master', 'chef', 'Chu', 'home', 'spectacular', 'banquet', 'would', 'only', 'expect', 'gourmet', 'restaurant', 'tirelessly', 'prepare', 'feast', 'daughters', 'who', 'hardly', 'seem', 'appreciate', 'culinary', 'skills.Jia-Jen', 'Kuei-Mei-Yang', 'chemistry', 'teacher', 'who', 'discovered', 'Christianity', 'Jia-Chen', 'Chien-Lien', 'Wu', 'airline', 'executive', 'who', 'love', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'marry', 'Jia-Ning', 'Yu-Wen', 'Wang', 'eye', 'friend', 's', 'boyfriend.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'centers', 'father', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'trying', 'find', 'new', 'life', 'watching', 'daughters', 'leave', 'start', 'own', 'lives.Indirectly', 'also', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'men', 'relationships', 'daughters', 'pursue', 'have', 'man', 'who', 'living', 'bachelor', 'lifestyle', 'naive', 'lover', 'who', 'just', 'learning', 'games', 'women', 'play', 'man', 'who', 'willing', 'change', 'religions', 'get', 'girl', 'dreams.This', 'movie', 'deliciously', 'dramatic', 'deeply', 'religious', 'themes', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'light', 'humor', 'was', 'not', 'offensive', 'also', 'see', 'three', 'lifestyles', 'presented', 'daughters', 'showing', 'how', 'deal', 'libidinous', 'whims', 'most', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'turns', 'appear', 'making', 'plot', 'entirely', 'entertaining.While', 'chef', 'Chu', 'ways', 'show', 'love', 'daughters', 'especially', 'estranged', 'one', 'daughters', 'who', 'only', 'criticism', 'food', 'scene', 'later', 'movie', 'father', 'using', 'same', 'tactic', 'communicate', 'love', 'daughter.Some', 'comedy', 'facial', 'expressions', 'especially', 'loved', 'part', 'where', 'chef', 'Chu', 'trying', 'eat', 'inedible', 'lunch', 'where', 'children', 'adopted', 'granddaughter', 'classroom', 'are', 'placing', 'orders', 'lunch', 'woman', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'laughing', 'when', 'out', 'nylons', 'bras', 'tied', 'up', 'together', 'washer.I', 'm', 'always', 'complaining', 'lack', 'chef', 'themes', 'movies', 'are', 'hungry', 'movies', 'cooking', 'themes', 'add', 'movie', 'must-see', 'menu', 'almost', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'twice', 'Once', 'subtitles', 'second', 'time', 'just', 'view', 'tantalizing', 'dishes', 'master', 'chef', 'Chu', 'Sihung', 'Lung', 'prepares.This', 'movie', 'reminded', 'Scent', 'Green', 'Papaya', '1994', 'However', 'Eat', 'Drink', 'Man', 'Woman', 'excels', 'presentation', 'cuisine', 'Scent', 'Green', 'Papaya', 'was', 'more', 'poetic', 'presentation', 'movie', 'visual', 'feast', 'want', 'know', 'now', 'where', 'cookbook', 'can', 'learn', 'how', 'make', 'dragon', 'Playful', 'romance', 'creative', 'cuisine', 'deep', 'rivers', 'emotional', 'drama', 'original', 'comedy', 'are', 'ingredients', 'make', 'movie', 'satisfying', 'feast', 'heart', 'soul.Three', 'words', 'take', 'Very', 'Seriously', 'watching', 'movie', 'Order', 'Chinese', 'Food', 'Do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn', 'Also', 'look', 'Babette', 'Feast', 'Water', 'Chocolate', 'Simply', 'IrresistibleandChocolat', 'Miramax', 'Collector', 'Series', '.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A
153126,A1J2931UBBJPXM,079284548X,Reviewer,"[8, 8]","A veritable smorgasbord of all the things that make life worthwhile, including good friendship, love, food and sex, can be found in Ang Lee's ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,"" the story of a widower who has raised three daughters on his own, and now that they are grown is ready to move on with his life.  Chu (Sihung Lung), a celebrated chef who runs the kitchen of a huge restaurant, finds himself at an impasse however; his daughters, Jia-Jen (Kuei-Mei Yang), the eldest, a teacher, Jia-Chen (Chien-lien Wu), his second, an airline executive, and Jia-Ning (Yu-Wen Wang), the youngest, who works at a fast food restaurant, all still live with their father, and though they are adults (all in their twenties), he feels responsible for them, as they are still under his roof.  They, on the other hand, feel responsible for him; he'll soon be retired, and they fear age is catching up with him.  And it makes them each, in turn, think twice about career opportunities and any romantic entanglements that may appear on the horizon.  it's a situation they all realize is not conducive to a happy, fulfilling and fully functional family life; the love is there, but it's seasoned with frustration, and no one seems to know what to do about it.Lee has crafted and delivered a complex, involving film, laced with poignancy and humor that deals with the kinds of problems most people face during the course of their lives.  And, of course, there's the love, the many faces of which are all explored here.  Food is the metaphor; Chu sets his table with a variety of tantalizing and exotic offerings, even as the table of life is set with like fare, and once set, it is up to the individual to sample what they will.  Fittingly, it is at the dinner table that many of the meaningful events in the lives of the family members are revealed.  Working from a screenplay written by Lee, James Schamus and Hui-Ling Wang, Lee uses the intricate emotional weave of the story to optimum effect with his ability to illuminate the sensibilities of his characters, and that he does it so well demonstrates the depth of his own insight into human nature.  And that he can so proficiently transfer the emotions of the written page to the screen demonstrates his mastery of the art of film directing.  As he proves with this film (as with films like ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), he is simply one of the best directors in the business.Lee's unique touch is also felt in the performances he exacts from his actors, a number of which are outstanding in this film, beginning with Lung, who brings Chu so credibly to life.  Wang, Wu and Yang are also exemplary in their portrayals of Chu's daughters.  To their credit-- as well as Lee's-- there's not a false moment to be found in their performances, all of which stand up to even the closest scrutiny.  These are all very real people in a very real setting, which enables the audience to identify and relate to the characters and their story, assuring that connection which makes this film such a satisfying experience.The supporting cast includes Sylvia Chang (Jin-Rong), Winston Chao (Li Kai), Chao-jung Chen (Guo Lun), Lester Chit-Man Chan (Raymond), Yu Chen (Rachel), Jui Wang (Old Wen) and Ah Lei Gua (Madame Ling).  As with real life, ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman"" is far from predictable, and is filled with twists and turns, including a surprise at the end that equals anything M. Night Shyamalan could come up with.  In the final analysis, this film is a delightful, entertaining reflection upon the human condition that will awaken your taste buds and prepare you for the feast of life.  And, like life, it is there for the taking; grab it with both hands and embrace it.

153127,A1GG3J0SNY1BQR,079284548X,Rick,"[7, 7]","My title suggests that this film is hedonistic but nothing could be further from the case. This film is, to be sure, sensuous in every sense of the word but it explores family relations in a meaningful and believable way. I've seen this film more times than I can remember over the past decade, mostly with mainland Chinese students. Each time I view it I find something more to appreciate, which to me marks a great film experience. In my estimation, this is Lee Ang's finest film, far surpassing the better known ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" in storyline and characterization. Yes, the traditional Chinese cooking is a feast for the eyes and indeed you may work up a healthy appetite if you view this film at the wrong time of the day. But there is far more than culinary delight to this film than many of the superficial reviews here would suggest. This is essentially a story about a father who is trying to find meaning in his life separate from his intimate family relationships (i.e. three rather willful daughters). In some sense, he is a kind of King Lear, but without the tragic baggage. A widower and retired gourmet chef, the father tries to keep his daughters near him by cooking a veritable emperor's banquet for them each Sunday. Although the daughters all live at home, they lead busy urban lives in Taipei and so the weekly ritual tends to crimp their style. Still, there is much ""comfort food"" here in both the dishes served and the words spoken. But don't get the impression that this film is maudlin in tone; it does not, in fact, take itself too seriously and there are ample moments of earthy Chinese humor (which translates rather well across cultures) and surprise leading to farce. The pace of the film is as rapid as the final meal preparations, in keeping with Chinese custom of serving everything quickly and as fresh as possible (no egg rolls here). For this we have fabulous film editing to thank and Lee Ang's gift for balancing action with dialogue, mood for mood. And far from being an artsy fartsy foreign film laden with self-conscious style, this film resonates with real characters fleshed out in real-life situations. A Taiwanese production, it avoids the stock characterization and outright stereotyping tediously depicted in most Western productions of East Asian culture. And I dare say at the risk of searching for the exotic, that this very male reviewer found most of the women in this film to be both lovely and graceful. You can enjoy this film immensely for its traditional elements and at the same time learn a lot about contemporary Chinese habits of thought, especially since its ending is anything but predictable. Indeed, it is the ending that many of my mainland Chinese students had to wrestle with, and perhaps you will too. All in all, one of the finest films of the past decade, foreign or not.",5,Man and Woman Make Love Here Before They Eat and Drink,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,2855,"['title', 'film', 'hedonistic', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'case', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'sensuous', 'sense', 'word', 'family', 'relations', 'meaningful', 'believable', 'way', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'remember', 'past', 'decade', 'mostly', 'mainland', 'Chinese', 'students', 'time', 'view', 'find', 'something', 'more', 'appreciate', 'great', 'film', 'experience', 'estimation', 'Lee', 'Ang', 'finest', 'film', 'far', 'surpassing', 'better', 'known', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'storyline', 'characterization', 'Yes', 'traditional', 'Chinese', 'cooking', 'feast', 'eyes', 'indeed', 'may', 'work', 'up', 'healthy', 'appetite', 'view', 'film', 'wrong', 'time', 'day', 'far', 'more', 'culinary', 'delight', 'film', 'many', 'superficial', 'reviews', 'here', 'would', 'suggest', 'essentially', 'story', 'father', 'who', 'trying', 'find', 'meaning', 'life', 'separate', 'intimate', 'family', 'relationships', 'i.e', 'three', 'rather', 'willful', 'daughters', 'sense', 'kind', 'King', 'Lear', 'tragic', 'baggage', 'widower', 'retired', 'gourmet', 'chef', 'father', 'keep', 'daughters', 'cooking', 'veritable', 'emperor', 'banquet', 'Sunday', 'daughters', 'live', 'home', 'lead', 'busy', 'urban', 'lives', 'Taipei', 'so', 'weekly', 'ritual', 'tends', 'crimp', 'style', 'Still', 'much', 'comfort', 'food', 'here', 'dishes', 'served', 'words', 'spoken', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'impression', 'film', 'maudlin', 'tone', 'not', 'fact', 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'are', 'ample', 'moments', 'earthy', 'Chinese', 'humor', 'rather', 'well', 'cultures', 'surprise', 'leading', 'farce', 'pace', 'film', 'as', 'rapid', 'final', 'meal', 'preparations', 'keeping', 'Chinese', 'custom', 'serving', 'everything', 'quickly', 'as', 'fresh', 'possible', 'egg', 'rolls', 'here', 'have', 'fabulous', 'film', 'editing', 'thank', 'Lee', 'Ang', 'gift', 'balancing', 'action', 'dialogue', 'mood', 'mood', 'far', 'being', 'artsy', 'fartsy', 'foreign', 'film', 'laden', 'self-conscious', 'style', 'film', 'real', 'characters', 'fleshed', 'out', 'real-life', 'situations', 'Taiwanese', 'production', 'stock', 'characterization', 'outright', 'stereotyping', 'tediously', 'depicted', 'most', 'Western', 'productions', 'East', 'Asian', 'culture', 'dare', 'say', 'risk', 'searching', 'exotic', 'very', 'male', 'reviewer', 'found', 'most', 'women', 'film', 'be', 'lovely', 'graceful', 'can', 'enjoy', 'film', 'immensely', 'traditional', 'elements', 'same', 'time', 'learn', 'lot', 'contemporary', 'Chinese', 'habits', 'thought', 'especially', 'ending', 'anything', 'predictable', 'Indeed', 'ending', 'many', 'mainland', 'Chinese', 'students', 'had', 'wrestle', 'perhaps', 'will', 'too', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'past', 'decade', 'foreign', 'not']",N/A

Lee manages to tell each character's story with care and humor. There are some hearty laughs, a number of touching dramatic moments, and towards the end even a couple of startling twists.There are a handful of movies that employ cooking as a metaphor of life. But Lee doesn't stop there -- he uses the *preparation* of food as a motif of life's experience as a whole, to include friendship and familial devotion, as well as desire, passion and love. On occasion, food also represents a substitute to all that.Ultimately, what makes a movie like this work is how much you care for its characters, each one wholesomely well-drawn and glibly multi-dimensional.

You see them warts and all... their idiosynchrocies, quirks, talents, loves, etc. are all exposed to the point you love every character.I saw this in the  theater with English subtitles, then saw it on video... the video wasn't  labeled as to how it was placed on the tape... and sadly, in lieu of  English subtitles, they dubbed in voices... a very bad move.  The only  Chinese I understand is what I order when I go out to eat... but even if  you don't speak Chinese, you get so much from hearing the real actors'  voices.  They are quite expressive.  I am learning disabled and read very  slowly, but I was able to follow the dialog without difficulty with the  subtitles and still tell what was going on.The talents displayed by the  master chef  &amp; father in the film opens up your mind to another culture  rich in history and talents.  You really feel like you're a part of this  family while watching the film and are emotionally attached to everyone in  it.A high quality, relationship-rich film coverning 3 generations of  life &amp; love.  Not a sappy &quot;girl movie&quot; but an  experience.If anyone knows how/when/where to get this film on DVD,  please let me know.  I've been looking everywhere for it.

Regarding the lavishing efforts of their father as invisible manipulation of their lives, the  daughters treat Mr. Chu's feast with little care and see no farther than  the dazzling dishes before them.  Mr. Chu combines the mastery of cooking  with the control of life as he swiftly adds in different blends into his  feasts as well as his daughters' lives.  Treating everything with a  steadfast attitude, choosing every ingredient with meticulous care, and  balancing his family vision with reality, Mr. Chu creates sparks in his own  life.  His daughters, however, constantly struggle with confusion and chaos  trying to find their niche in an ever-changing society where everything  seems transitory.  Only by refocusing on life in a subtle way, on Mr. Chu's  dinner table where they are forced to look at life simply as a feast-a  beginning, a middle, and an end-do the daughters gradually realize the pace  of life and where they belong.Superb cast, better w/ out the dubbling.",4,Charming tale blending love with food,947030400,"01 5, 2000",2000,1108,"['beginning', 'film', 'Jia-Chien', 'carelessly', 'father', 'Sunday', 'dinner', 'tradition', 'ritualistic', 'torture', 'Regarding', 'lavishing', 'efforts', 'father', 'invisible', 'manipulation', 'lives', 'daughters', 'treat', 'Mr.', 'Chu', 'feast', 'little', 'care', 'see', 'farther', 'dazzling', 'dishes', 'Mr.', 'Chu', 'mastery', 'cooking', 'control', 'life', 'swiftly', 'different', 'blends', 'feasts', 'as', 'well', 'daughters', 'lives', 'Treating', 'everything', 'steadfast', 'attitude', 'choosing', 'ingredient', 'meticulous', 'care', 'balancing', 'family', 'vision', 'reality', 'Mr.', 'Chu', 'sparks', 'own', 'life', 'daughters', 'however', 'constantly', 'confusion', 'chaos', 'trying', 'find', 'niche', 'ever-changing', 'society', 'where', 'everything', 'transitory', 'Only', 'refocusing', 'life', 'subtle', 'way', 'Mr.', 'Chu', 'dinner', 'table', 'where', 'are', 'forced', 'look', 'life', 'simply', 'feast-a', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end-do', 'daughters', 'gradually', 'realize', 'pace', 'life', 'where', 'belong.Superb', 'cast', 'better', 'w/', 'dubbling']",N/A

I loved Eat Drink Man Woman so I had to read some of the one and two star reviews to see why others disliked it so much. From what I've gathered, the negativity underscores larger issues I have with so much of the crap that comes out of Hollywood. That a movie as touching, heartfelt, and lovely as this is seen as boring to others proves my larger point; movies like Eat Drink Man Woman aren't made enough in America and when they do get made, they are often watered down adaptations of grander ideas, streamlined for the short attention span Hollywood has helped create. In other words; in the absence of Seth Rogan's on-going juvenile antics or Saw-like torture, what movie is truly worthwhile to the typical American movie-goer?Sarcasm aside, there is so much to revel in here; mouthwatering food, the artistry of its preparation, the need to follow our truest calling, the mystery of love, the tempestuous and conflicting nature of family relations, and the universal scope of all of these issues. Ang Lee delivers a delicious feast of humanity that satisfied my hunger for movies that value artistic integrity over box office receipts. True to the food theme of this beautiful work, for every hundred fast food joints, spread like choking dandelions across the landscape, there blooms one lovely flower of a restaurant where the food is expertly prepared and where time slows to allow the splendor of the moment to envelope you and open your senses to the totality of the experience.
