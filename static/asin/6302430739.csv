I'm not Jewish, am a California native, and this time period was way before my time, but somehow this movie is strangely appealing, comforting, and familiar to me.Anyway, the story is about a young man named Larry Lapinsky (Lenny Baker) who finally gets to leave his Jewish parents' home in Brooklyn to move to a place of his own in New York City's famed Greenwich Village in the mid 1950s. This was around the time that the bohemian/beatnik movements were beginning to bloom, and Larry finds himself right at home with a motley group of people including his  girlfriend played by Ellen Greene who portrayed ""Audrey"" inLittle Shop of Horrors (Snap Case)and other artist/actor types. Shelly Winters was fantastic as Larry's shrill, harping mother and Antonio Fargas is wonderful as Larry's gay friend ""Bernstein Chandler."" The rest of the cast is superb as well and you get to see some great exterior shots of NYC & the Village, albeit circa 1975-76 when the movie was actually filmed.Some might find this movie pointless, but I enjoyed it and there are some really touching scenes in it.The picture quality is good, but the only special features included are the trailer and audio commentary with Ellen Greene and writer director Paul Mazursky.",5,Something *Charming* About This Movie...,1267574400,"03 3, 2010",2010,1337,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'NEXT', 'STOP', 'GREENWICH', 'VILLAGE', 'DVD', 'find', 'so', 'endearing', ""'m"", 'not', 'Jewish', 'am', 'California', 'native', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'way', 'time', 'somehow', 'movie', 'strangely', 'appealing', 'comforting', 'familiar', 'me.Anyway', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Larry', 'Lapinsky', 'Lenny', 'Baker', 'who', 'finally', 'leave', 'Jewish', 'parents', 'home', 'Brooklyn', 'move', 'place', 'own', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'famed', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'mid', '1950s', 'was', 'time', 'bohemian/beatnik', 'movements', 'were', 'beginning', 'bloom', 'Larry', 'right', 'home', 'motley', 'group', 'people', 'including', 'girlfriend', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Greene', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Audrey', 'inLittle', 'Shop', 'Horrors', 'Snap', 'Case', 'other', 'artist/actor', 'types', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Larry', 'shrill', 'harping', 'mother', 'Antonio', 'Fargas', 'wonderful', 'Larry', 'gay', 'friend', 'Bernstein', 'Chandler', 'rest', 'cast', 'superb', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'see', 'great', 'exterior', 'shots', 'NYC', 'Village', 'circa', '1975-76', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'filmed.Some', 'might', 'find', 'movie', 'pointless', 'enjoyed', 'are', 'really', 'touching', 'scenes', 'it.The', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'only', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'are', 'trailer', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Ellen', 'Greene', 'writer', 'director', 'Paul', 'Mazursky']",Next Stop Greenwich Village VHS

312452,ABE8YHLYSM15G,6302430739,Luke Killion,"[1, 1]","""Next Stop Greenwich Village"" was released in 1976, portraying a classic struggling actor in Lenny Baker's character of Larry Lapinsky. At first I wasn't so convinced of Baker's talent or the angle which directed Paul Mazursky wanted to take on the controversial center of New York's nucleus for ""alternative lifestyles"" and artists. Apparently Mazursky based the character of Larry on himself, and his early years depicting the transition he experienced from moving out of his native Brooklyn for the boho capitol of America, Greenwich Village.I found that the story progresses quite well and corelates in many ways to the literature that came of out Greenwich Village from the WWI generation, as well as the Beats, whose presence is felt in this movie even thought that title isn't applied to Lenny or any of his friends. Perhaps this was because the film takes place in 1953 and that literary movement hadn't really broken into the mainstream lexicon at that point. Other films have been made about that time and place, such as the Carrolyn Cassidy biopic ""Heartbeat"" in 1980, which evidences the particular difficulty of realisticly translating a scene such as Greenwich Village or San Francisco's North Beach onto the big screen.  I was pleasantly surprised by Mazursky's sensibility and this film is testimony to the fact that as an actor and artist, he experienced it first hand, making his take on the spirit of the day very relevant.I thought that Mazursky's location and cast was excellent. As a New Yorker, he takes to the streets to capture the footage in a truly authentic setting, and like the literature of Villagers such as Henry Miller, it shows how the characters really define the story, rather than a twisting and well established plot line. Most of the tensions created in this film are entirely based upon interpersonal dealings of the cast, as well as their artistic ambitions. Mazursky's take on the Village at this point in time says alot about the vanity and appearance many aspiring artists give off to the world; there is alot of posing and role playing that blur the line between acting as a trade and conning people into making them believe in a false identity for art's sake. There are also alot of hangers on, who are downright hustlers with the facade of an artist; among them is a bushy bearded bunko artist who comes on to women as a recruiter for modeling agencies, as well as connecting clients to illegal abortion doctors. In the ""free love"" experimental atmosphere of Greenwich Village, the viewer learns that this sometimes is the only option for fast women who forsake the tradition or marriage upon pregnancy.The cast that Mazursky assembled is perfect and is one of the best ensemble preformances that I've seen depicting 20th Century American artistic circles. The party ambience is very genuine and the viewer almost wonders if the sequences were more of a recreation than a case of simply pretending to enjoy the company of friends in a large gathering. Lenny Baker's character shows alot of versatility, who like many other aspiring Villagers works a day job and attends acting classes at night. He is not an unrepentant subversive, such as Ginsberg who desires to stir things up; he is more of a believer in himself as an actor and desperately needs to put some space between him and his overbearing Polish/ Jewish mother. His fondness for quoting Shakespeare at deserted railway stations in the wee hours of the morning shows that many would be artists ran foul of the law when they pushed their creative impetus a little too hard. Christopher Walken also gives a fine preformance as Robert the playwright, who ran away at the age of 15 and has a large ego and an easy demeanor with the ladies. Mazursky uses these two characters to create a disparity between the artist for the sake of art compared to the vane showman looking for attention. Mazursky also shows that just because Lenny moves to the Village, he doesn't become a radical communist nut case, which was a common conception (there is some dialogue about Joseph McCarthy's hearings). He walks the line between real responsibility and doing the right thing, with his desires for independance and pre marital sex with his girlfriend Sarah, played by Ellen Greene.  His relationship with her is the pivotal point for much of his story, and is a good example of the foward thinking manner they embraced, but also the problems that can accompany that choice.",4,Authentic take on the realities of early 50's NY City artistic community,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,4464,"['Next', 'Stop', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'was', 'released', '1976', 'portraying', 'classic', 'struggling', 'actor', 'Lenny', 'Baker', 'character', 'Larry', 'Lapinsky', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'convinced', 'Baker', 'talent', 'angle', 'directed', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'wanted', 'take', 'controversial', 'center', 'New', 'York', 'nucleus', 'alternative', 'lifestyles', 'artists', 'Apparently', 'Mazursky', 'based', 'character', 'Larry', 'early', 'years', 'depicting', 'transition', 'experienced', 'moving', 'native', 'Brooklyn', 'boho', 'capitol', 'America', 'Greenwich', 'Village.I', 'found', 'story', 'quite', 'well', 'corelates', 'many', 'ways', 'literature', 'came', 'out', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'WWI', 'generation', 'as', 'well', 'Beats', 'presence', 'felt', 'movie', 'even', 'thought', 'title', ""n't"", 'applied', 'Lenny', 'friends', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'film', 'place', '1953', 'literary', 'movement', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'broken', 'mainstream', 'lexicon', 'point', 'Other', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'time', 'place', 'such', 'Carrolyn', 'Cassidy', 'biopic', 'Heartbeat', '1980', 'particular', 'difficulty', 'realisticly', 'translating', 'scene', 'such', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'San', 'Francisco', 'North', 'Beach', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Mazursky', 'sensibility', 'film', 'testimony', 'fact', 'actor', 'artist', 'experienced', 'first', 'hand', 'making', 'take', 'spirit', 'day', 'very', 'relevant.I', 'thought', 'Mazursky', 'location', 'cast', 'was', 'excellent', 'New', 'Yorker', 'streets', 'capture', 'footage', 'truly', 'authentic', 'setting', 'literature', 'Villagers', 'such', 'Henry', 'Miller', 'how', 'characters', 'really', 'define', 'story', 'rather', 'twisting', 'well', 'established', 'plot', 'line', 'Most', 'tensions', 'created', 'film', 'are', 'entirely', 'based', 'interpersonal', 'dealings', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'artistic', 'ambitions', 'Mazursky', 'take', 'Village', 'point', 'time', 'alot', 'vanity', 'appearance', 'many', 'aspiring', 'artists', 'give', 'world', 'alot', 'posing', 'role', 'playing', 'line', 'acting', 'trade', 'conning', 'people', 'making', 'believe', 'false', 'identity', 'art', 'sake', 'are', 'also', 'alot', 'hangers', 'who', 'are', 'downright', 'hustlers', 'facade', 'artist', 'bushy', 'bearded', 'bunko', 'artist', 'who', 'women', 'recruiter', 'modeling', 'agencies', 'as', 'well', 'connecting', 'clients', 'illegal', 'abortion', 'doctors', 'free', 'love', 'experimental', 'atmosphere', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'viewer', 'only', 'option', 'fast', 'women', 'who', 'forsake', 'tradition', 'marriage', 'pregnancy.The', 'cast', 'Mazursky', 'assembled', 'perfect', 'one', 'best', 'ensemble', 'preformances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'depicting', '20th', 'Century', 'American', 'artistic', 'circles', 'party', 'ambience', 'very', 'genuine', 'viewer', 'almost', 'wonders', 'sequences', 'were', 'more', 'recreation', 'case', 'simply', 'pretending', 'enjoy', 'company', 'friends', 'large', 'gathering', 'Lenny', 'Baker', 'character', 'alot', 'versatility', 'who', 'many', 'other', 'aspiring', 'Villagers', 'day', 'job', 'acting', 'classes', 'night', 'not', 'unrepentant', 'subversive', 'such', 'Ginsberg', 'who', 'stir', 'things', 'up', 'more', 'believer', 'actor', 'desperately', 'put', 'space', 'overbearing', 'Polish/', 'Jewish', 'mother', 'fondness', 'quoting', 'Shakespeare', 'deserted', 'railway', 'stations', 'wee', 'hours', 'morning', 'many', 'would', 'be', 'artists', 'ran', 'foul', 'law', 'when', 'pushed', 'creative', 'impetus', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'also', 'fine', 'preformance', 'Robert', 'playwright', 'who', 'ran', 'away', 'age', '15', 'large', 'ego', 'easy', 'demeanor', 'ladies', 'Mazursky', 'two', 'characters', 'create', 'disparity', 'artist', 'sake', 'art', 'compared', 'vane', 'showman', 'looking', 'attention', 'Mazursky', 'also', 'just', 'Lenny', 'Village', ""n't"", 'become', 'radical', 'communist', 'nut', 'case', 'was', 'common', 'conception', 'dialogue', 'Joseph', 'McCarthy', 'hearings', 'walks', 'line', 'real', 'responsibility', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'desires', 'independance', 'pre', 'marital', 'sex', 'girlfriend', 'Sarah', 'played', 'Ellen', 'Greene', 'relationship', 'pivotal', 'point', 'much', 'story', 'good', 'example', 'foward', 'thinking', 'manner', 'embraced', 'also', 'problems', 'can', 'accompany', 'choice']",Next Stop Greenwich Village VHS

312455,A39IY0JU5JI69G,6302430739,"Promise ""promise""","[2, 2]","This is a sweet memoire of a precious time in the life of Paul Mazursky.  The man has a lot of heart and it shows here in this film which could have been really bad in the hands of a lesser writer/director.  The characters are familiar to us:  the aspiring actor from Brooklyn, trying desperately to get away from his overbearing Jewish mamma, the henpecked dad, the younger set of arty types of mixed races and sexual preferences.  What keeps the film fresh is the very real affection Mazursky feel for the folks; otherwise they could have fallen into terrible cliches.The cast is uniformly good and perfectly chosen for their roles.  Shelly Winters as the Mom gives one of her best performances, in my opinion.  She is an actress whose shrill over-the-top style often turns me off and she still lets the stops go here but there is a warmth and genuine joie de vivre that I found endearing.  The actor who plays the dad has few lines to say, as he did in life, but his face tells a lot.  I found his presence quite moving and again he avoided the stereotype and brought a genuine human feeling to it.  Ellen Greene is very good as the pretty Jewish girl who is the love interest.  We never know quite how she feels about the actor; she plays it just right, somewhere between sweet and cagey.Lenny Baker is Larry Lipinsky, the Mazursky alter ego.  I suppose that since Mazursky chose him, he was right for the role.  Personally I found him a little annoying, especially when he went into his grandiose acting spiels, but that's  no doubt how 22 year old aspiring actors in the 50's were.Christopher Walken, who is billed as ""Chris Walken"" is eye catching in a small role, as Robert, one of the buddies.  He is portrayed as a cold hearted bastard, as opposed to Lenny who truly loves the girl, but frankly I thought the girl made the right choice by running off with him to Mexico.  Lenny's version of love is just as egotistical in its own way as Robert's and his sense of moral superiority is a bit unfounded-- especially when he hit the girl.  Jeff Goldblum gives a noteworthy cameo, too.  No wonder Walken and Goldblum went on to greater roles.It's a period piece and people who love New York, especially the New York of the 50's will find a lot to like in this film.",4,Nice piece of 50's Village nostalgia,1205971200,"03 20, 2008",2008,2270,"['sweet', 'memoire', 'precious', 'time', 'life', 'Paul', 'Mazursky', 'man', 'lot', 'heart', 'here', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'bad', 'hands', 'lesser', 'writer/director', 'characters', 'are', 'familiar', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'Brooklyn', 'trying', 'desperately', 'get', 'away', 'overbearing', 'Jewish', 'mamma', 'henpecked', 'dad', 'younger', 'set', 'arty', 'types', 'mixed', 'races', 'sexual', 'preferences', 'What', 'film', 'fresh', 'very', 'real', 'affection', 'Mazursky', 'feel', 'folks', 'otherwise', 'could', 'have', 'fallen', 'terrible', 'cliches.The', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'good', 'perfectly', 'chosen', 'roles', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'Mom', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'opinion', 'actress', 'shrill', 'over-the-top', 'style', 'often', 'off', 'still', 'stops', 'go', 'here', 'warmth', 'genuine', 'joie', 'de', 'vivre', 'found', 'endearing', 'actor', 'who', 'dad', 'few', 'lines', 'say', 'did', 'life', 'face', 'lot', 'found', 'presence', 'quite', 'moving', 'again', 'avoided', 'stereotype', 'brought', 'genuine', 'human', 'feeling', 'Ellen', 'Greene', 'very', 'good', 'pretty', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'never', 'know', 'quite', 'how', 'actor', 'just', 'right', 'somewhere', 'sweet', 'cagey.Lenny', 'Baker', 'Larry', 'Lipinsky', 'Mazursky', 'alter', 'ego', 'suppose', 'Mazursky', 'chose', 'was', 'right', 'role', 'Personally', 'found', 'little', 'annoying', 'especially', 'when', 'went', 'grandiose', 'acting', 'spiels', 'doubt', 'how', '22', 'year', 'old', 'aspiring', 'actors', '50', 'were.Christopher', 'Walken', 'who', 'billed', 'Chris', 'Walken', 'eye', 'catching', 'small', 'role', 'Robert', 'one', 'buddies', 'portrayed', 'cold', 'hearted', 'bastard', 'opposed', 'Lenny', 'who', 'truly', 'girl', 'frankly', 'thought', 'girl', 'made', 'right', 'choice', 'running', 'off', 'Mexico', 'Lenny', 'version', 'love', 'just', 'as', 'egotistical', 'own', 'way', 'Robert', 'sense', 'moral', 'superiority', 'bit', 'unfounded', 'especially', 'when', 'hit', 'girl', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'noteworthy', 'cameo', 'too', 'wonder', 'Walken', 'Goldblum', 'went', 'greater', 'roles.It', 'period', 'piece', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'New', 'York', 'especially', 'New', 'York', '50', 'will', 'find', 'lot', 'like', 'film']",Next Stop Greenwich Village VHS

312458,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,6302430739,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[22, 22]","This early Paul Mazursky film could well be his finest achievement.  Wonderfully mixing irony and affection, it examines bohemian New York in the 50's, its scenes generously filled with the assorted types - from fragile to vicious - who then flocked to Greenwich Village, seeking personal freedom and frequently a career in the arts. Mazursky's knowledge of that time and place is unerring; the pubs, the street life and the character types he presents are accurately, hilariously and, often, movingly drawn. From the frequenters of the San Remo to the Brando imitators at the Actor's Studio, he recreates the aspiring young people of a time long since gone but still fresh in the memories of some persons who were part of it.A nostalgic invocation of the past, however, is not the film's sole or even chief strength. That honor goes instead to the amazing part of the actor hero's mother brilliantly portrayed by Shelley Winters, clearly in the role of her career.  She is the Jewish Mother On Film for all time.  Not just a stereotypical devotee of the classic formula - control guilt feelings and you control the child - she is also, surprisingly and freshly, herself a frustrated artist.  When she weeps over the radio singing of Jussi Bjorling, vowing to hear him in person at the Met, or unconventionally jitterbugs, mad glint in her eye, with a black gay guy at a Greenwich Village party she crashes, we feel affection for her despite her cluelessness and manipulations.  Hers is an unfulfilled life in Brooklyn, for she's bursting with an artist's energy which has no outlet.  This becomes the ground of her aspiring actor son's and then our eventual respect and affection for her despite her meddling as the would-be power behind the son's throne.
