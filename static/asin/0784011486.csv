What daughter hasn't loved her father and wanted him to be her hero?In ""The Music Box,"" a fifty year old secret turns a family into a battleground.  A father is accused of the most horrible crimes imaginable.  His devoted daughter runs to his rescue.  The pacing and suspense are superb.  Scene by scene we see witness after witness reveal a knowledge of this man that the daughter cannot fathom. They have the wrong man.  The wrong man, she states with resolve.  Her defense is that it is a case of mistaken identity.During his trial, she learns that her father has been having an affair with a neighbor for ten years.  She realizes that her father is expert at keeping secrets. She is shocked that she never saw this aspect of his personality.  Her secretary sees what the daughter cannot see.  The secretary helps her find the courage she needs.Forrest Tucker, who is prosecuting her father, is compassionate, yet determined to see her father brought to justice. But the daughter is brighter and better at the law than her opponent.  She wins legal point after legal point.Around all this emotional turmoil, we are once again reminded of the atrocities of World War II.  We see the suffering and agony of the survivors of man's inhumanity against his human family.The ending of this film makes my heart pound for about the last twenty minutes.  If you gloss over truth in your life and trade in rationalizations, you might not enjoy this film. It is a film for those who are willing to lose what appears to be valuable,in return for what is only valuable,the absolute and undeniable truth.",5,Jessica Lange in her most brilliant performance...,1122508800,"07 28, 2005",2005,1694,"['film', 'riveting', 'Every', 'time', 'watch', 'am', 'struck', 'intensity', 'emotional', 'reaction', 'What', 'daughter', ""n't"", 'loved', 'father', 'wanted', 'be', 'hero', 'Music', 'Box', 'fifty', 'year', 'old', 'secret', 'family', 'battleground', 'father', 'accused', 'most', 'horrible', 'crimes', 'imaginable', 'devoted', 'daughter', 'rescue', 'pacing', 'suspense', 'are', 'superb', 'Scene', 'scene', 'see', 'witness', 'witness', 'reveal', 'knowledge', 'man', 'daughter', 'can', 'not', 'fathom', 'have', 'wrong', 'man', 'wrong', 'man', 'resolve', 'defense', 'case', 'mistaken', 'identity.During', 'trial', 'father', 'been', 'having', 'affair', 'neighbor', 'ten', 'years', 'father', 'expert', 'keeping', 'secrets', 'shocked', 'never', 'saw', 'aspect', 'personality', 'secretary', 'what', 'daughter', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'secretary', 'find', 'courage', 'needs.Forrest', 'Tucker', 'who', 'prosecuting', 'father', 'compassionate', 'yet', 'determined', 'see', 'father', 'brought', 'justice', 'daughter', 'brighter', 'better', 'law', 'opponent', 'legal', 'point', 'legal', 'point.Around', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'reminded', 'atrocities', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'see', 'suffering', 'agony', 'survivors', 'man', 'inhumanity', 'human', 'family.The', 'ending', 'film', 'heart', 'pound', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'gloss', 'truth', 'life', 'trade', 'rationalizations', 'might', 'not', 'enjoy', 'film', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'lose', 'what', 'be', 'valuable', 'return', 'what', 'only', 'valuable', 'absolute', 'undeniable', 'truth']",N/A

This is the scenario for THE MUSIC BOX, a 1990 release, in which Jessica Lange plays a criminal defense lawyer asked by her widower father to defend him against such charges being brought by the US government on behalf of Hungary. The father, played by Armin Mueller-Stahl, is alleged to have committed multiple atrocities as an officer of a neo-Nazi police unit in Budapest during World War II. A complicating element is the father's vocal anti-communism, for which, he claims, the Red regime back in the old country is masterminding a frame-up. (Remember, we're talking about bad ol' days of the Cold War here.) Anyway, the Old Man needs a hotshot attorney, so his dutiful and devoted daughter takes the case.Another reviewer has concluded that the plot is ""far-fetched"". Hmm. I would think that those aging American residents who've actually been charged with Nazi war crimes during the past couple of decades might not find it so far-fetched at all. Some have even been deported. Perhaps he's referring to the storyline that calls for the accused to be defended by his own offspring. OK, that probably wouldn't happen in real life. But, what is an otherwise idle Hollywood screenwriter to do when called upon to help fabricate a box office success?The plot's arguable implausibility aside, both Lange and Mueller-Stahl give forceful and bravura performances as two people caught up in the fading echoes of receding history. The final scene between the two should have earned Lange that year's Oscar, but sadly didn't. There're also some quite good visual images of Budapest, which, at the end of the Cold War when this film was shot, was probably the Eastern Bloc's most beautiful capital city.Notwithstanding that I've always been a little in love with Jessica Lange ever since TOOTSIE, I liked this film a lot.

In fact, the acting performances of the entire cast is completely realistic and believable. There are many close-ups and so much is told by the actor's expressions.  I sat enraptured by the superb quality of the acting and the drama.Unfortunately, the sound quality of this dvd is abysmal!  One literally has to strain to hear the dialogue.  And to make things worse, this DVD has no audio subtitles.  With all the whispering that goes on in this film, the lack of sound quality is quite frustrating.  For a movie of this quality, it is a shame that the production was not packaged with additional extras, subtitles, etc.  This is a bare bones dvd.This is a 5-star movie, no doubt about it; however, the inferior quality of the sound replication detracts from the experience.kone",4,Gripping Drama - Terrible Sound!,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,869,"['Jessica', 'Lange', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'acting', 'Academy', 'Award', 'worthy', 'fact', 'acting', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'completely', 'realistic', 'believable', 'are', 'many', 'close-ups', 'so', 'much', 'told', 'actor', 'expressions', 'sat', 'enraptured', 'superb', 'quality', 'acting', 'drama.Unfortunately', 'sound', 'quality', 'dvd', 'abysmal', 'One', 'literally', 'strain', 'hear', 'dialogue', 'make', 'things', 'worse', 'DVD', 'audio', 'subtitles', 'whispering', 'film', 'lack', 'sound', 'quality', 'quite', 'frustrating', 'movie', 'quality', 'shame', 'production', 'was', 'not', 'packaged', 'additional', 'extras', 'subtitles', 'etc', 'bare', 'bones', 'dvd.This', '5-star', 'movie', 'doubt', 'however', 'inferior', 'quality', 'sound', 'replication', 'detracts', 'experience.kone']",N/A

The annoying Jessica Lange in the lead role. Armin Mueller-Stahl while on the downward slide. (If you don't believe me, check out the last, say, ten or so things he's done at imdb. Then come back and tell me I'm wrong.) Writing by the abominable Joe Eszterhas (Basic Instinct, Jade, Showgirls) and direction by Costa-Gavras in his ""I'm such an artist I can drop my first name!"" phase. Yep-- with the exception of Julia Roberts and Kevin Costner showing up, this one has every last ingredient to make it a perfectly awful film. So why isn't it?This is the weirdly absorbing tale of a Hungarian immigrant charged with war crimes forty years after coming to America; his daughter, who also happens to be his lawyer; her son, the closest member of the family to the immigrant (quite ably played by Mueller-Stahl; Lukas Haas plays the kid); the annoying son (Michael Rooker's best performance since Henry, and perhaps his last good one to date); the annoying prosecuting attorney (slimily done to the hilt by the always-invigorating Frederic Forrest); and perhaps some of the best, if least believable, courtroom-drama scenes this side of Law and Order.I say ""weirdly absorbing"" because there's really nothing out of the ordinary about this tale, aside from the fact that some otherwise-workmanlike actors turned in the performances of their careers in this movie, the writing is so unlike Eszterhas' usual tripe that one suspects a ghostwriter, and Costa-Gavras (whose first name, if you want to [censored for Amazon consumption], is Konstantinos) must have thought he was directing in Europe, because he never made another American film this good. The character sketches are kept simple, and yet they're not parodies; questions are raised and answered, but the movie never becomes an easily-categorizable whodunit; and everyone is just so damn believable that it all works.

75410,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,0784011486,Z Hayes,"[5, 5]","""The Music Box"" was a slow yet suspenseful build-up, and when the climax came, it packed such a wallop, making it one of the most memorable human dramas that I've watched. Jessica Lange [in an Oscar-nominated performance]plays a successful criminal defense attorney who finds herself defending her Hungarian immigrant father, Michael Laszlo [Armin Muehller-Stahl in a powerful role] who is accused of lying about his world war II activities to get into the US and become a citizen. Specifically, he is accused of being Mischa, a member of the Arrow Cross, a far-right pro-Nazi,  anti-Semitic national socialist party who committed crimes against humanity during WW II, especially against the Jewish populace of Hungary.Michael's daughter [Lange] refuses to believe the accusations and builds up a strong defense for her father, even though her composure is seen being shaken during some of the harrowing testimonies by Holocaust survivors [and also a Gentile woman who was gang-raped by ""Mischa"" and his fellow Arrow Cross goons]. Her faith in her father is so strong that she refuses to accept any evidence proving the contrary, even when the evidence stares her right in the face [produced by her industrious secretary]. It is only when she goes to Hungary to hear the testimony of a witness who is terminally ill that she begins to have serious doubts, and she returns to the US with a pawn ticket that may hold the key to the entire drama.The suspense is built up very credibly - even as Lange scores point after point against the prosecution, the viewer gets the sense that the defence may be winning, but is it really the truth that is being represented, and who exactly is getting justice - the victims of Mischa or Michael Laszlo, the accused? And the final scene between father and daughter is poignant, harrowing and horrific all at the same time.This is a multi-layered movie - of a daughter's unwavering love for her father, of a man running away from and not facing a tainted past, of the lack of repentance, the power of memory decades after the war, and of justice being served in a most ironic manner.The performances by the key players all deserve accolades - Lange as the defendant's daughter is compelling, Muehller-Stahl as the father is stoic and unwavering, and Frederic Forrest as the Prosecutor Jack Burke is credible in his performance. Even the brief appearances by the actors portraying the survivors are memorable - each testimony felt real and was painful to hear. All in all, ""The Music Box"" is a well-directed and credibly acted movie that packs a punch for the message it delivers.",4,Remembrance of things past and horrific,1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,2613,"['Music', 'Box', 'was', 'slow', 'yet', 'suspenseful', 'build-up', 'when', 'climax', 'came', 'packed', 'wallop', 'making', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'human', 'dramas', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Jessica', 'Lange', '[', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', ']', 'successful', 'criminal', 'defense', 'attorney', 'who', 'defending', 'Hungarian', 'immigrant', 'father', 'Michael', 'Laszlo', '[', 'Armin', 'Muehller-Stahl', 'powerful', 'role', ']', 'who', 'accused', 'lying', 'world', 'war', 'II', 'activities', 'get', 'US', 'become', 'citizen', 'Specifically', 'accused', 'being', 'Mischa', 'member', 'Arrow', 'Cross', 'far-right', 'pro-Nazi', 'anti-Semitic', 'national', 'socialist', 'party', 'who', 'committed', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'WW', 'II', 'especially', 'Jewish', 'populace', 'Hungary.Michael', 'daughter', '[', 'Lange', ']', 'believe', 'accusations', 'up', 'strong', 'defense', 'father', 'even', 'composure', 'seen', 'being', 'shaken', 'harrowing', 'testimonies', 'Holocaust', 'survivors', '[', 'also', 'Gentile', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'gang-raped', 'Mischa', 'fellow', 'Arrow', 'Cross', 'goons', ']', 'faith', 'father', 'so', 'strong', 'accept', 'evidence', 'proving', 'contrary', 'even', 'when', 'evidence', 'right', 'face', '[', 'produced', 'industrious', 'secretary', ']', 'only', 'when', 'Hungary', 'hear', 'testimony', 'witness', 'who', 'terminally', 'ill', 'have', 'serious', 'doubts', 'US', 'pawn', 'ticket', 'may', 'hold', 'key', 'entire', 'drama.The', 'suspense', 'built', 'up', 'very', 'credibly', 'even', 'Lange', 'scores', 'point', 'point', 'prosecution', 'viewer', 'sense', 'defence', 'may', 'be', 'winning', 'really', 'truth', 'being', 'represented', 'who', 'exactly', 'getting', 'justice', 'victims', 'Mischa', 'Michael', 'Laszlo', 'accused', 'final', 'scene', 'father', 'daughter', 'poignant', 'harrowing', 'horrific', 'same', 'time.This', 'multi-layered', 'movie', 'daughter', 'unwavering', 'love', 'father', 'man', 'running', 'away', 'not', 'facing', 'tainted', 'past', 'lack', 'repentance', 'power', 'memory', 'decades', 'war', 'justice', 'being', 'served', 'most', 'ironic', 'manner.The', 'performances', 'key', 'players', 'deserve', 'accolades', 'Lange', 'defendant', 'daughter', 'compelling', 'Muehller-Stahl', 'father', 'stoic', 'unwavering', 'Frederic', 'Forrest', 'Prosecutor', 'Jack', 'Burke', 'credible', 'performance', 'Even', 'brief', 'appearances', 'actors', 'portraying', 'survivors', 'are', 'memorable', 'testimony', 'felt', 'real', 'was', 'painful', 'hear', 'Music', 'Box', 'well-directed', 'credibly', 'acted', 'movie', 'punch', 'message']",N/A
