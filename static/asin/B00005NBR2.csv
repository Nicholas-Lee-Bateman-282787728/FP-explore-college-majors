The videos bring out the spirit of the songs and the optional lyrics on-screen are nice as well.  It helps you to contemplate the poetry and meaning of the lyrics.  The director commentaries are nice as well and it gives some behind the scenes info on the band as well.  I would recommend this DVD to any Dave fan.",5,"I was apprehensive, but it is a good DVD",1030665600,"08 30, 2002",2002,393,"['was', 'little', 'nervous', 'DVD', 'first', 'purchase', 'videos', 'bring', 'out', 'spirit', 'songs', 'optional', 'lyrics', 'on-screen', 'are', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'contemplate', 'poetry', 'meaning', 'lyrics', 'director', 'commentaries', 'are', 'nice', 'well', 'scenes', 'info', 'band', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'Dave', 'fan']",Dave Matthews Band - The Videos 1994-2001
667455,AWQSHRGVWKGXY,B00005NBR2,brent,"[11, 11]","In a way, this is DMB's greatest hits.  All of these songs were hits, and putting the videos togehter was Dave's way of releasing these ""greatest hits.""  The result is great, because these videos are truly amazing.  From the visual wonder of ""Crash Into Me"" to the fun, summer-y feel of ""Stay"" to the live clips in ""Tripping Billies"" and the cool effects in ""I Did it,"" this DVd delivers on all levels.  All 12 videos have director commentary, and there are behind the scenes fueatures on ""Don't Drink the Water,"" ""Stay"" and ""I Did It.""  This DVD is worht buying.  The songs are great, and the quality is very good, with optional lyrics at the bottom.What Would You Say- (10 of 10)- A very cool debut video.  It features the now famous firedancer.  It's a good song and the video is funky, just like the song.  It is very good.Ants Marching (10 of 10)- This video is the worst video on here.  It is simply boring, but the song is great, and this is the first ever Dave video I saw, so I love it.Satellite- (10 of 10)- This is a great song with an interesting video that makes me want to go and blow bubbles.  It's a cool video.Too Much (10 of 10)- This is a very cool video, too.  It is just plain funky.  The song is great, too.So Much to Say- (10 of 10)- This video is cool to watch.  There is a very cool scene with two Dave's!  What could be better than two Dave's!Crash Into Me (11 of 10)- By far their best video.  It is so clever, and I love the shot of Stefan with the bass with his hand reaching out.  The colors, the lyrics, the music, everything about this video is great.Tripping Billies (10 of 10)- This video is very cool.  It shows the listener what is great about their live shows.  The song is packed with power, and by the end of the video, you feel like you just watched a live show.  Very cool.Don't Drink the Water (10 of 10)- This is a very cool vidoe, as well.  I love Dave's head, and Boyd in dressed in the violins.  The only problem is that ths song was cut short by several minutes.  This song is so good, and I wish it was the whole thing that got released.Stay (11 of 10)- Another of my favorite videos.  It is such a fun video.  From the barber to the dancing chick with the big head, to the band playing in white tuxedos, it is just a great video and a great song.Crush (10 of 10)- Like ""Don't Drink the Water"" this song, too was cut short when it was released.  It is still a great song, and the video is very cool.  It captures the mood of the song very well, with the black and white, and I love the part with the tiled floor.  Cool video.I Did it (10 of 10)- Cool video, not so cool song.  This song is weak, but the video has cool effects and some fuky scenes.  It is a cool video.  Don't get me wrong, the song isn't bad, it's just not their best.The Space Between (10 of 10)- Pretty cool video.  I like the rain int he end, especially on the drum.  It is pretty cool, and I love the song.  Along with ""Everyday"" and ""When the World Ends"" its the strongest song off of ""Everyday.""The only thing I don't like about this DVD is that it doesn't add videos as Dav'e career progresses.  I miss not having ""Everyday"" and ""Where are you Going.""  Someday, they'll hopefully release another one.  This DVD is well worth the money, and is fun to watch over and over.",5,Very Fun.

What a great purchase.There's not much to say about the videos themselves other than they are well done.  The cool thing is what they've added to the DVD.  For instance:- Press &quot;Subtitle&quot; on your remote and you get the lyrics on the bottom of the sceen as the video plays.  Nice touch.- Commentaries... once you get curious or want a change of pace, you can get the video with the makers talking over the top.  Kind of interesting, but I only want to go through it once... the music is better than the talking!- Special features ... They go into detail of how they made a couple of the videos.  The &quot;I Did It&quot; feature is the most interesting.One thing I didn't realize when I bought the DVD, turning off the TV and letting it play through the stereo system is, in effect, playing a DMB &quot;greatest hits&quot; album.  That's nice too.One more thing, if you are an DMB fan, this is worth the money.  However, I met someone yesterday who had never heard of Dave Matthews Band.  Don't ask ME how that happened.  Anyway, she saw some of the disc with me and is now a fan too.
