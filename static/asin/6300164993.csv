197815,A1JN63QBBNGB78,6300164993,Amazon Customer,"[26, 29]","It's been over twenty years since this miniseries first aired but who can forget Stacy Keach's performance as the artist Julian Mistral or the part played by the late Lee Remick as a conniving and scheming woman who stopped at nothing to trap and keep Mistral in a lovless marriage.  This epic love story spans several generations and reveals the level of despair and sheer decadance some of the characters fell into during this span and how their lives remained forever interwoven.  You can almost feel Mistral's pain in his last days as it is revealed how his paintings came to reflect his anguish and guilt for having refused shelter during WWII to acquaintances of the Jewish Faith and how that refusal ultimately led to their deaths at the hands of the Nazis.  With his death and through his will, he finally gets revenge for the years of dispair he endured during his loveless marriage and the tragic loss of the only woman he truly ever loved. The miniseries was filmed almost entirely in Europe and the scenery is dazzling; the acting superb.  Of course the beautiful Stephanie Powers and handsome Timothy Dalton also helped beautify the scenery!  This is a three to four hanky movie.  Enjoy!",5,Finally!

I don't know what kind of emotion that would have created in the mother, nor would I want to know. But for the observer, the story is hard to resist.Stacy Keach (Mistral) was allegedly battling substance abuse problems while this filmed. He was adequate, and perhaps would have been more so had it not been for the cocaine.Lee Remick (Kate) was lovely on the outside, even if her character wasn't so lovely on the inside.Stefanie Powers (Maggie) did a great job, but to me she absolutely should have been Teddy. I even picture her as Teddy as I periodically re-read passages of the book.Lily Taylor (Teddy) was so miscast! I will not fault her acting talent, but Teddy was supposed to be ""the greatest supermodel of all time"" and Taylor simply did not fit the role, which of course was not her fault.Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu (Fauve) was fabulous! Then a newcomer, she was exquisite. She was plausible as a supermodel's daughter and was worth hanging around for during the third act. I sat through all of Two Brothers before I realized that the young mother was Philippine.If you watch closely during the dinner party, you will see a brunette Kristin Scott Thomas flirting with Mistral.I often blow past the middle part of this miniseries because the war footage and anti-Semitic mentality is nothing but a drag. Also, with Taylor being less than a fit for Teddy this part of the film is just not for me.All told, it is a classic Judith Krantz multi-generational saga.
