The film  changes from black and white to color, representing the zombies' or the humans' perspective; the zombies see themselves as talking and walking normally whereas the rest are talking and walking at an accelerated pace.

Zombies!""----------------------------------Note: mild spoilers below----------------------------------""Shaun Of The Dead"" will remain the gold standard of zomb-comedies (although some might argue that the entire genre is comedic...) but ""Aaaaah!  Zombies!"" provides a few good guffaws. The premise is great: the protagonists, a group of self-involved twenty-somethings have been infected with a government-created zombie virus but they are unaware that they have become zombies. Their perceptions alter so that, in their slow, shambling forms, they now see normal humans as hyperactive weirdos with high, squeaky voices.  Although they can talk among themselves and have rational conversations, all humans is rahhh!!! grunt! argh! and it takes the zombie kids a while to catch on to their true predicament.  It's a funny concept, deliberately framed as a goofy, super-cheapo midnight movie, packed with -- indeed, entirely constructed out of --  irony-laden, relentlessly cliched dialogue and crass, broad, see-it-coming-a-mile-away humor. Some of it's effective, but the film could have used a little more punch, and perhaps slightly crisper, more vigorous editing. Of course, I was not stoned or intoxicated while watching it, and doubtless that would help with the viewing experience.Not great, but worth checking out if you're a zombie flick fanatic.

Unfortunate that there are no bonus features since this is one movie that could have had a fun commentary at least.  There is no nudity and little gore, but what it does have are some really fun characters and good writing.  This film makes the zombies the heroes which i love most about it.  So don't hope to see Walking Dead or something - the military and others are the bad guys here.  It's all about 4 friends and a soldier who happen to end up becoming zombies, but they don't know it.  That is where the comedy is, to each other they seem normal - other than some superhuman abilities.  They think they have become super soldiers and that others around them are infected with some hyper rage.

Zombies!&lt;/strong> (Matthew Kohnen, 2007)This is a movie I really, really wanted to love with all my heart. Done well, it could have been paradigm-shifting. Genre-defining. It could have made the zombie movie something more, and better, than it is today. However, because if its many, many shortcomings, there's no real chance of that ever happening, and unless someone really, really good comes along and does a remake, that will not change.Plot: four friends, all of whom are different flavors of your basic idiot, by chance (and ice cream) ingest a super-secret toxic substance that was supposed to vanish into the ocean without a trace. The four are Tim (&lt;em>Bones&lt;/em>' Michael Grant Terry), the nose-to-the-grindstone kid who's been pining for the girl next door for ten years and has never managed to get up the courage to ask her out. Then there's the girl next door herself, Cindy (TV character actress Betsy Buetler; gamer geeks may recognize the voice from &lt;em>Dragon Age: Origins&lt;/em>), who's just plain too ditzy to have picked up on Tim's attention. Then there's Tim's best friend, the typical party dude, Mike (&lt;em>Blue Crush&lt;/em>'s Matthew Davis), and his backstabbing, get-ahead-however ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Julianna Martin from the McBride TV-movie franchise). A few minutes later, the four of them are zombies. Here's the real kicker, the paradigm-shifting moment--they don't realize they're zombies. They come across a soldier, Nick Steele (&lt;em>Changeling&lt;/em>'s Colby French), who informs them there's a zombie plague, and it all slots into place: everyone ELSE is infected! They need to protect their families and all that other good stuff. Except, well, they don't know they're zombies.Can I possibly get across to you how cool this idea is? And I'm not even riding it for being a zombedy; after all, the greatest game-changer since Romero was stupid slapstick (1986's &lt;em>Return of the Living Dead&lt;/em>), but it was also a brilliant piece of moviemaking. This is not. While some of the acting is halfway decent (French is by far the best of this bunch, and understands how to almost, but not quite, overplay his role while everyone else around him crosses that line in the first three minutes of the movie), and there are a few clever bits to be had in the script, most of it is your basic zombie movie, but told from the perspective of the zombies. It could have been so, so, so much more than it is.
