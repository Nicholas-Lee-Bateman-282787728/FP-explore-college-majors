Dawod ""Ash""","[3, 6]","I have never smiled sooo much through a 'Mystery film'.This is a very cool movie.Many have labeled it as an ""Artsy"" movie, to my ARTSY usually means abstract or undefined. This movie is straight forward, a guy is dead in the begining of the movie and the detective is trying to find out  who killed him or if it was suicide. Very basic, but what is NOT basic is the suspects / witnesses.Each one is living in his own world, you have the mentaly challenged, the [...] artiest, the one who thinks he's the 5th beatle. So the enjoyment is seeing how the detective *who is just as strange as the other charecters* tries to get information out of them. So you get a little romance, and alot of smiles through this experiance.I personally enjoyed it, espcially with the fact that you hear Bono singing almost throught the whole movie :DWhy did I give it 4 & not 5 stars?I was not too happy with the extra features, they did not title anyone when they are speaking, so if you don't know the names of the actors, producers ect..then your out of luck. Also the audio in the extra features was a bit unstable, low to high depeding on who is being interviewed..AND I was VERY disapointed not to find at least ONE music video for the movie from Bono, there are songs in the movie that Bono had written FOR the movie, it would have helped if they actually Interviewed Bono, since he is a co-writter in the film to give us more insight on the inspiration for this project.Other than that, it is a very cool movie, with  a very believeable cast, I mean you actually believe this guys are NUTS, its fantastic. And for a murder/thriller, it actually dosen't have that much violence or blood in it...but alot of smiles.",4,a 4 Star hotel.,1152057600,"07 5, 2006",2006,1701,"['have', 'never', 'smiled', 'sooo', 'much', ""'Mystery"", ""film'.This"", 'very', 'cool', 'movie.Many', 'have', 'labeled', 'Artsy', 'movie', 'ARTSY', 'usually', 'abstract', 'undefined', 'movie', 'straight', 'forward', 'guy', 'dead', 'begining', 'movie', 'detective', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'killed', 'was', 'suicide', 'Very', 'basic', 'what', 'NOT', 'basic', 'suspects', '/', 'witnesses.Each', 'one', 'living', 'own', 'world', 'have', 'mentaly', 'challenged', '[', ']', 'artiest', 'one', 'who', '5th', 'beatle', 'enjoyment', 'seeing', 'how', 'detective', '*who', 'just', 'as', 'strange', 'other', 'charecters*', 'tries', 'get', 'information', 'So', 'get', 'little', 'romance', 'alot', 'smiles', 'experiance.I', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'espcially', 'fact', 'hear', 'singing', 'almost', 'whole', 'movie', 'DWhy', 'did', 'give', '4', 'not', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'happy', 'extra', 'features', 'did', 'not', 'title', 'anyone', 'when', 'are', 'speaking', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'names', 'actors', 'producers', 'ect..then', 'luck', 'Also', 'audio', 'extra', 'features', 'was', 'bit', 'unstable', 'low', 'high', 'depeding', 'who', 'being', 'interviewed..AND', 'was', 'VERY', 'disapointed', 'not', 'find', 'least', 'ONE', 'music', 'video', 'movie', 'Bono', 'are', 'songs', 'movie', 'Bono', 'had', 'written', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'actually', 'Interviewed', 'Bono', 'co-writter', 'film', 'give', 'more', 'insight', 'inspiration', 'project.Other', 'very', 'cool', 'movie', 'very', 'believeable', 'cast', 'mean', 'actually', 'believe', 'guys', 'are', 'NUTS', 'fantastic', 'murder/thriller', 'actually', 'dose', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'violence', 'blood', 'alot', 'smiles']",The Million Dollar Hotel

He must try to deduce who the killer is among the hotel's bizzare guests. He enlists the help of the victims mentally ill best friend Todd (Jeremy Davies) to be his partner. TomTom also is one of the hotel patrons and he drags his equally unwell girlfriend Eloise (Milla Jovovich) into the picture. Among the suspects are a John Lennon wannabe, complete with Liverpool accent (Donal Logue)and a wacko American Indian,  Israel ""Geronimo"" Goldkiss (Jimmy Smits). Other familiar faces to appear among the guests include Amanda Plummer and Julian Sands. But what Skinner doesn't realize is that Todd has set him up and is getting the guests to throw all manner of red herrings into the investigation.MILLION DOLLAR HOTEL has an effectively dark noirish setting and aspires to be a modern day SUNSET BLVD. or MALTESE FALCON but it misses the mark. The first half of the film is stylish but icy and pretentious, the second (and more absorbing) half gives the viewer the chance to have more involvement with the characters. It's still worth a look, but it requires patience on the viewer's part. DVD extras include deleted scenes, interviews with the cast and crew and commentaries from Bono and Wim Wenders.",3,"Not quite a Million Dollar Dud, but lacks Wim and vigour",1050192000,"04 13, 2003",2003,1557,"['Written', 'co-produced', 'U2', 'Bono', 'directed', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'MILLION', 'DOLLAR', 'HOTEL', 'more', 'movie', 'film', 'students', 'analyze', 'nitpick', 'casual', 'viewers.In', 'one', 'most', 'bizzare', 'best', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'FBI', 'agent', 'JD', 'Skinner', 'who', 'investigating', 'suicide/', 'possible', 'murder', 'billionaire', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'run', 'down', 'hotel', 'must', 'try', 'deduce', 'who', 'killer', 'hotel', 'bizzare', 'guests', 'help', 'victims', 'mentally', 'ill', 'best', 'friend', 'Todd', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'be', 'partner', 'TomTom', 'also', 'one', 'hotel', 'patrons', 'equally', 'unwell', 'girlfriend', 'Eloise', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'picture', 'suspects', 'are', 'John', 'Lennon', 'wannabe', 'complete', 'Liverpool', 'accent', 'Donal', 'Logue', 'wacko', 'American', 'Indian', 'Israel', 'Geronimo', 'Goldkiss', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'Other', 'familiar', 'appear', 'guests', 'include', 'Amanda', 'Plummer', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'what', 'Skinner', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Todd', 'set', 'getting', 'guests', 'throw', 'manner', 'red', 'herrings', 'investigation.MILLION', 'DOLLAR', 'HOTEL', 'effectively', 'dark', 'noirish', 'setting', 'aspires', 'be', 'modern', 'day', 'SUNSET', 'BLVD', 'MALTESE', 'FALCON', 'mark', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'stylish', 'icy', 'pretentious', 'second', 'more', 'absorbing', 'half', 'viewer', 'chance', 'have', 'more', 'involvement', 'characters', 'still', 'worth', 'look', 'patience', 'viewer', 'part', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'commentaries', 'Bono', 'Wim', 'Wenders']",The Million Dollar Hotel

Surprise, Roth is in this flick for about two seconds, and Gibson is stuck in a toned down reprise of his ""Payback"" role.  Which means gravelly voice and none of the charm that is his speciality.  The plot is fragmented, the stories are crudely stuck together and the acting is sub-par.  Milla Jovovich is fun to look at, like always, but apart from her startlingly sharp cheekbones and piercing eyes, she is pretty well glamoured down.You should be able to figure out the situation behind this movie without even watching it.  It is a 2001 release that most people have never heard of.  A film released straight to video with Mel Gibson?  How could a studio do that to a film with such a marketable star?  Remember movie executives are there to make money, if they thought there was anything even remotely worthwhile in this film then it must have been horrible.  It is.The movie drags along under the narration of Jeremy Davies' character, Tom-Tom.  The lines don't explain anything, are often repetitive, and are often whispered for the sake of generating some atmosphere.  The only thing they suceed in generating is annoyance.I could go on, but what's the point?  Don't watch this movie, don't rent it, and certainly don't buy it.  It isn't good.  Plain and simple.

574356,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B000059PQH,"""flickjunkie""","[9, 11]","It is tempting to pick up this film, as I did, because it stars Mel Gibson.  If that is your motivation, think very carefully.  Mel gives one of his less memorable performances and is more of an ensemble cast member than a lead actor in this film.  Director Wim Wenders is considered by many to be one of Europe's best directors.  This film offers numerous examples of that, but while it is an interesting character study of some very disturbed people, the story is so flimsy that the excellent acting and directing still can't prop it up.The story brings us a slice of the lives of some very mentally challenged people who live in a run down hotel. It is narrated by one of the characters as he plunges toward the ground after having leapt from the roof.  FBI Detective Skinner (Mel Gibson) is investigating the death of Izzy Goldkiss, an artist (Tim Roth) who lived in the hotel.  Izzy also plummetted to his death from the roof of the hotel.  Everyone but Skinner thinks it was a suicide.Along the way we are subjected to the bizarre behavior of the residents of a loony bin without bars.  It is like watching ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" without the storyline.  We are treated to flamboyantly odd people, but we lack a reason for watching them and the novelty wears off quickly.  The dominant theme is the love story between Eloise (Milla Jovovich) and Tom Tom (Jeremy Davies), who is our plunging narrator.  This relationship is heartrending, but it is not enough to save the film.  Though all the characters are colorfully portrayed, the uneven presentation does little more than make a case for the institutionalization of the mentally impaired.The acting by the ensemble cast is terrific.  Milla Jovovich took this part fresh from her role as Joan of Arc in ""The Messenger"".  Her portrayal of Joan was controversial because she played her as a borderline lunatic (and did so brilliantly).  That experience served her well in this film, and it establishes Jovovich as one of the better depicters of the mentally bereft.  Unfortunately, there are not enough such parts to warrant abandoning her modeling career.  Jeremy Davies is the brightest spot in the cast with a wonderfully quirky performance.  Jimmy Smits takes a delightful plunge into murky waters with an over the top portrayal of Geronimo, an Hispanic ""Indian"".  Smits is terrific at the straight macho roles he usually plays, but this is quite a departure.  He does a fabulous job and it is so incongruous to see him in the role that it is fun to watch.I'm not sure why Mel Gibson took this role.  He has played some offbeat characters, but this one is off the chart.  It was more of a caricature than a character.  After the film opened, in a gesture of actor's remorse he publicly badmouthed the film to anyone who would publish his remarks.  That was not a class maneuver.  He should have been a professional and refrained from comment.This is an interesting character study that is about thirty minutes more madness than the average viewer should be required to bear.  I rated it a 6/10 despite the weak story because of the strength of the acting.  It's worth a look for Wenders fans, but Gibson fans steer clear.",3,"Excellent acting, weak story",989193600,"05 7, 2001",2001,3191,"['tempting', 'pick', 'up', 'film', 'did', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'motivation', 'think', 'very', 'carefully', 'Mel', 'one', 'less', 'memorable', 'performances', 'more', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'member', 'lead', 'actor', 'film', 'Director', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'one', 'Europe', 'best', 'directors', 'film', 'numerous', 'examples', 'interesting', 'character', 'study', 'very', 'disturbed', 'people', 'story', 'so', 'flimsy', 'excellent', 'acting', 'directing', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'prop', 'up.The', 'story', 'slice', 'lives', 'very', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'run', 'down', 'hotel', 'narrated', 'one', 'characters', 'ground', 'having', 'leapt', 'roof', 'FBI', 'Detective', 'Skinner', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'investigating', 'death', 'Izzy', 'Goldkiss', 'artist', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'who', 'lived', 'hotel', 'Izzy', 'also', 'plummetted', 'death', 'roof', 'hotel', 'Everyone', 'Skinner', 'was', 'suicide.Along', 'way', 'are', 'subjected', 'bizarre', 'behavior', 'residents', 'loony', 'bin', 'bars', 'watching', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'storyline', 'are', 'treated', 'flamboyantly', 'odd', 'people', 'lack', 'reason', 'watching', 'novelty', 'quickly', 'dominant', 'theme', 'love', 'story', 'Eloise', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Tom', 'Tom', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'who', 'plunging', 'narrator', 'relationship', 'heartrending', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'colorfully', 'portrayed', 'uneven', 'presentation', 'little', 'more', 'make', 'case', 'institutionalization', 'mentally', 'impaired.The', 'acting', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'terrific', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'took', 'part', 'fresh', 'role', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'Messenger', 'portrayal', 'Joan', 'was', 'controversial', 'played', 'borderline', 'lunatic', 'did', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'experience', 'served', 'well', 'film', 'Jovovich', 'one', 'better', 'depicters', 'mentally', 'bereft', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'such', 'parts', 'warrant', 'abandoning', 'modeling', 'career', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'brightest', 'spot', 'cast', 'wonderfully', 'quirky', 'performance', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'delightful', 'plunge', 'murky', 'waters', 'top', 'portrayal', 'Geronimo', 'Hispanic', 'Indian', 'Smits', 'terrific', 'straight', 'macho', 'roles', 'usually', 'quite', 'departure', 'fabulous', 'job', 'so', 'incongruous', 'see', 'role', 'fun', 'watch.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'took', 'role', 'played', 'offbeat', 'characters', 'one', 'chart', 'was', 'more', 'caricature', 'character', 'film', 'opened', 'gesture', 'actor', 'remorse', 'publicly', 'badmouthed', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'publish', 'remarks', 'was', 'not', 'class', 'maneuver', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'professional', 'refrained', 'comment.This', 'interesting', 'character', 'study', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'more', 'madness', 'average', 'viewer', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'bear', 'rated', '6/10', 'weak', 'story', 'strength', 'acting', 'look', 'Wenders', 'fans', 'Gibson', 'fans', 'steer', 'clear']",The Million Dollar Hotel

Or at least they are such great movies that they make you think what they reveal is truth.This movies was amazing on enough levels that I'm speechless to review it, so instead I'll just make a few observations:I watched this movie with Amazon's ""instant video"" high-def >> TiVo, because this is (perhaps) the only HD, Panavision-shaped version of the film, and it was certainly worth the trouble.  Beautiful film and far better than the ""Starz"" transfer or what I imagine the standard-def DVD would be.Some people have questioned how all these people could pay for their stay in the hotel; I suggest they were getting SSI checks for their insanity.  Much cheaper to pay for their seedy hotel rental than a mental hospital, and ""de-institutionalizing"" is considered the modern, humane way in America.Others may think this odd, but this movie reminded me more than anything, of Blade Runner without the sci-fi.  Similarly quirky characters; the run-down old-school Los Angeles locations, the deep philosophical ramblings on the meaning of humanity, and the hard-boiled cop who's less human than the crazies/androids he's supposed to be policing.When Wenders' name came on-screen at the end, I applauded even though I was the only person in the room, so I must have enjoyed it.",4,"Great in Amazon HD-on-Demand! / ""Who's crazy now?""",1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,1424,"['fan', 'Wim', 'Wenders', 'know', 'movies', 'can', 'contain', 'long', 'boring', 'stretches', 'end', 'reveal', 'great', 'truth', 'human', 'condition', 'least', 'are', 'such', 'great', 'movies', 'make', 'think', 'what', 'reveal', 'truth.This', 'movies', 'was', 'amazing', 'enough', 'levels', ""'m"", 'speechless', 'review', 'instead', ""'ll"", 'just', 'make', 'few', 'observations', 'watched', 'movie', 'Amazon', 'instant', 'video', 'high-def', '>', '>', 'TiVo', 'perhaps', 'only', 'HD', 'Panavision-shaped', 'version', 'film', 'was', 'certainly', 'trouble', 'Beautiful', 'film', 'far', 'better', 'Starz', 'transfer', 'what', 'imagine', 'standard-def', 'DVD', 'would', 'be.Some', 'people', 'have', 'questioned', 'how', 'people', 'could', 'pay', 'stay', 'hotel', 'suggest', 'were', 'getting', 'SSI', 'checks', 'insanity', 'Much', 'cheaper', 'pay', 'seedy', 'hotel', 'rental', 'mental', 'hospital', 'de-institutionalizing', 'considered', 'modern', 'humane', 'way', 'America.Others', 'may', 'think', 'odd', 'movie', 'reminded', 'more', 'anything', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'sci-fi', 'Similarly', 'quirky', 'characters', 'run-down', 'old-school', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'locations', 'deep', 'philosophical', 'ramblings', 'meaning', 'humanity', 'hard-boiled', 'cop', 'who', 'less', 'human', 'crazies/androids', 'supposed', 'be', 'policing.When', 'Wenders', 'name', 'came', 'on-screen', 'end', 'applauded', 'even', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'room', 'must', 'have', 'enjoyed']",The Million Dollar Hotel

The film is jam-packed with stars.  Jeremy Davies is breathtaking as Tom-Tom.  He literally dances his part with springs and leaps substituting for steps, and gestures borrowed from a Japanese Kabuki play.  His portrayal of a mentally-challenged person is pure cinematic poetry.  The love story is very simple, very pure, very odd, but totally engaging.  Mel Gibson as the ex-freak who used to have a hand growing out of his back must have wanted to work with Wim Wenders.  We lose much of the humor we usually get from his performances.  Amanda Plummer and Bud Cort as two of the residents of Million Dollar Hotel shine.  Plummer is particularly touching as she goes up to the millionaire father of the dead man and introduces herself as his fiance by throwing her arms around him and saying, &quot;Dad!&quot;  Jimmy Smits was on holiday in the movie as Geronimo, the artist who paints in tar and tries to scam the art world.  Wenders' stately style gives a sense of poetry to the mentally ill.  The film might seem to drag a bit.  Davies' performance and the bizarre editing cuts propel the film.

But originality doesn't always make an entertaining film.  What's the whole point of the movie:  that the mentally challenged can fall in love too?  To allow Wenders to wield his cinematic sword and make lovely looking scenes, and to give Bono another chance to try and show us he is not just a rock star?Some of the movie has some wonderful moments, and yes the romance between Tom Tom and Eloise is touching in its different approach.  Jeremy Davies gives a tremendous performance as Tom Tom, which is why I give the movie three stars.  His portrayal of the ""idiot"" is so on target one forgets he's acting.  Milla Jovovich should stick to the Resident Evil movies; her waifishness seemed forced and her character too off the wall to be believable.  Gloria Stuart, that lovely elderly lady who came back to the cinematic world's attention in TITANIC, seems to be used merely to spout four letter obscenities to show that foul language is cool for the octogenarian set.  Jimmy Smits and Bud Cort offer support, but their characters are too underdeveloped to really impact the movie.  That leaves us Mel Gibson in probably his most unusual role.  While he infuses some manic intensity in the role of the FBI agent who had an arm removed from his back (come on writers, let's not test the waters too much), overall he merely seems to be doing a favor for Wenders and Bono.Cryptic and overblown, MILLION DOLLAR HOTEL did not make a wave in theatres; I can understand why.

In my mind it deserves more than that, for this  is truly a remarkable film.The Million Dollar Hotel is a home for  outcasts and mentally unstable people. Once it was probably a high-class  place, but time has taken its toll and it is now merely a parody of itself.  Inhabitants include a mad Indian Chief wannabe (played by Jimmy Smits), a  guy who thinks he's a member of the Beatles (hilariously played by Peter  Stormare) the retarded ""hero"" of the story Tom Tom (Jeremy Davies) and the  shadowy, silent Elouise (Milla Jovovich) who he has a serious crush on.  One day Tom Tom's nearest friend fall off the roof of the hotel, and foul  play is suspected. It is then up to an FBI Special Agent (Mel Gibson) to  find the murderer. This is no easy task indeed!What sets this movie  apart from the mainstream is that it oozes atmosphere and that is dares to  be *different*. Director Wim Wenders has taken the story by none other than  Bono from U2 and worked his magic on it. The result is a visually stunning  film with some of the most intense moments I've ever seen. Add the amazing  soundtrack, also by Bono, and the excellent performances by all actors and  the result should be obvious: an instant classic.Bear in mind, though,  that this is my opinion of the movie. It is shared by a couple of my  friends, but other reviewers have strongly criticised the film. I fail to  see why, but it just seems to be one of those movies that people either  love or hate. In any case I strongly recommend seeing it, if only to  experience its intense, sad beauty.
