I was reminded of the original 1950s version of HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (w/ Vincent Price) where a group of strangers is sealed in a huge mansion, and told that whoever survives the night will receive a large sum of money. Of course, HAUNTED HILL was made strictly for fun, with its extremely high cheeeze factor. HOUSE OF 9 is far more serious, w/ much death and destruction! Though not as complex as CUBE or as bloody as SAW 2, it does have a similar set-up and atmosphere to these classics. An unknown maniac has abducted, drugged, and imprisoned 9 people (including Dennis Hopper as a priest!!) in a veritable fortress of a place. His only message to his ""guests"" is that 5 million dollars awaits the one who remains alive.

958773,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000CGX7FW,Chris Kennison,"[31, 35]","I was pleasantly surprised by House of 9. As the movie begins, I saw the premise unfold and thought... what a great idea... sort of SAW 2 meets BATTLE ROYALE meets SURVIVOR.Although more of a ripoff of SAW 2 (or maybe SAW 2 was a ripoff of House of 9? Not sure, maybe it was unintentional), HOUSE of 9 approaches the subject with fresh ideas and MORE REALISM. Where Saw 2 struggles to be commercial and come up with BIZARRE and MORE BIZARRE ways to kill people with the funky contraptions and riddles, HOUSE of 9 keeps it real.As 9 unwitting people are snatched off the streets and wake up in a house that is sealed and unescapable, they are told that one person will be allowed to leave the house, and that person will be given $5 million... that one person is the soul survivor... meaning... the only way out... is for them to kill each other.Where Saw 2 wastes no time getting into the depravity and murder and the thin assumption that a bunch of criminals will want to murder the son of the man who put them in prison, HOUSE of 9 keeps it real. It explores human nature and the unwillingness to comply and wait it out. How long would it take for a house full of strangers to actually want to kill each other? And how? there is one gun, with few bullets.The mostly unknown cast, with the exception of Dennis Hopper and Kelly Brook, deliver well. As time goes by, the food is minimal, the personalities are clashing and tensions are building. Violence is coming and you can feel it, despite the members of the house's relucatance to participate in the sick game.Unfortuntaley, the director relied to heavily on a couple of MTV montage moments that seemed to go on forever, the movie is actually a really good comment on human nature, madness, survival and what happens to a person when they've taken the life of another.I'll admit... 4 stars... may, just may be a little too strong, and 5 stars is WAY TOO STRONG... but the movie was entertaining and better than most of the little straight to video movies that hit the video store shelves. I never once wished I was watching something else. I wanted to watch it unfold and see what was in store.Not to mention, the ENDING was FANTASTIC! The ending... the final scene when the winner picks up their money... was the best part of the movie.Rent it, watch it, I only recommend to buy if you're a big Kelly Brook fan.

958775,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000CGX7FW,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[9, 9]","House of 9 offers very little but a slightly new twist on an archetypal horror motif and some pretty incomprehensible casting.  Dennis Hopper as a priest?  I mean, come on, a priest?  Hopper?  Casting really dropped the ball all the way around on this one, I'm afraid.  Hopper is probably the best actor of the whole bunch.  They should have called this movie House of 9 Bad Actors, or House of 9 Characters You Desperately Want to See Die.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you actually have to slog through the entire first half of the movie to get to the first of the characters' eagerly-anticipated deaths.  The first forty five minutes is basically these nine people moaning about their fate and verbally attacking one another.So here's the premise.  Nine individuals are randomly chosen to partake in a little contest, and by chosen I mean kidnapped, drugged, and deposited within the confines of a mysterious house.  Once they all awaken and gather together, they learn that one of them will win five million dollars.  There will be no consolation prizes for the losers, however, as they will all be dead.  You see, in order to win, you have to outlive the other eight people in the house.  So who are these lucky people chosen to take part in this deadly little game?  Well, you have a priest (Hopper), a dancer, a criminal, a pro tennis player, a fashion designer, a cop, a composer and his wife, and a would-be rapper, each and every one a total stereotype, especially the rude, vulgar, selfish, cop-hating rapper (honestly, I'm surprised someone in the black community hasn't protested this film's racist characterization of the offensive rapper).Once they're satisfied that there is no way out of this place, the group comes together and sort of decides not to play the madman's game, as he obviously wants them to turn on and kill one another.  That spirit of mutual cooperation amongst suffering doesn't last long, of course.  These characters are all so incredibly annoying, there's no way anyone could put up with them for long.  You'll be ready to reach in and strangle every last one of them yourself long before they stop bickering and get down to the business of showing audiences the ugly side of human nature.Once characters start dying (immediately after taking a quick break from their verbal sparring in order to bump and grind against one another to some really bad rap music), the movie finally finds a little traction in the blood that is spilled.  The second death is a particularly brutal thing to watch.  It's all downhill from that point, though, as the filmmakers dropped whatever pretense of character development there was and just had everyone start killing each other.  It leads up to a fairly decent ending, but there was really no way for the film to recover from its disastrous first half.Dennis Hopper does provide some unintentional entertainment, though.  He plays what I assume is an Irish priest, but he has a habit of forgetting his fake accent - and when he does actually remember to use it, he sounds more like some Indian chief out of an old western than an Irishman.  I guess I should mention the fact that all of these characters are European, so you've got accents flying all over the place in this one.Definitely, those entering the House of 9 should beware of stereotypes, clich&eacute;s, accents, and overused horror motifs.  And don't go expecting a nice nude scene or two to help you over the rough patches, either.  There were only two women in the film I would even want to imagine naked, and neither one comes close to revealing anything at all.  It also bugs me that ""the Watcher"" can afford this big, escape-proof house and five million dollar payouts, but the cameras he has installed in every room are no better than the crappy security cameras you find in banks.  All in all, I think I'm being pretty darn generous in giving this film three stars.",3,"When are these annoying characters going to die, already?",1182297600,"06 20, 2007",2007,3920,"['House', '9', 'offers', 'very', 'little', 'slightly', 'new', 'twist', 'archetypal', 'horror', 'motif', 'pretty', 'incomprehensible', 'casting', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'priest', 'mean', 'come', 'priest', 'Hopper', 'Casting', 'really', 'dropped', 'ball', 'way', 'one', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'Hopper', 'probably', 'best', 'actor', 'whole', 'bunch', 'should', 'have', 'called', 'movie', 'House', '9', 'Bad', 'Actors', 'House', '9', 'Characters', 'Desperately', 'Want', 'See', 'Die', 'hate', 'be', 'bearer', 'bad', 'news', 'actually', 'have', 'slog', 'entire', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'get', 'first', 'characters', 'eagerly-anticipated', 'deaths', 'first', 'forty', 'five', 'minutes', 'basically', 'nine', 'people', 'moaning', 'fate', 'verbally', 'attacking', 'one', 'another.So', 'here', 'premise', 'Nine', 'individuals', 'are', 'randomly', 'chosen', 'partake', 'little', 'contest', 'chosen', 'mean', 'kidnapped', 'drugged', 'deposited', 'confines', 'mysterious', 'house', 'awaken', 'gather', 'together', 'learn', 'one', 'will', 'win', 'five', 'million', 'dollars', 'will', 'be', 'consolation', 'losers', 'however', 'will', 'be', 'dead', 'see', 'order', 'win', 'have', 'outlive', 'other', 'eight', 'people', 'house', 'who', 'are', 'lucky', 'people', 'chosen', 'take', 'part', 'deadly', 'little', 'game', 'Well', 'have', 'priest', 'Hopper', 'dancer', 'criminal', 'pro', 'tennis', 'player', 'fashion', 'designer', 'cop', 'composer', 'wife', 'would-be', 'rapper', 'one', 'total', 'stereotype', 'especially', 'rude', 'vulgar', 'selfish', 'cop-hating', 'rapper', 'honestly', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'someone', 'black', 'community', ""n't"", 'protested', 'film', 'racist', 'characterization', 'offensive', 'rapper', '.Once', ""'re"", 'satisfied', 'way', 'place', 'group', 'together', 'sort', 'decides', 'not', 'play', 'madman', 'game', 'obviously', 'turn', 'kill', 'one', 'spirit', 'mutual', 'cooperation', 'suffering', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'course', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'incredibly', 'annoying', 'way', 'anyone', 'could', 'put', 'up', 'long', ""'ll"", 'be', 'ready', 'reach', 'strangle', 'last', 'one', 'long', 'stop', 'bickering', 'get', 'down', 'business', 'showing', 'audiences', 'ugly', 'side', 'human', 'nature.Once', 'characters', 'start', 'dying', 'immediately', 'taking', 'quick', 'break', 'verbal', 'sparring', 'order', 'bump', 'grind', 'one', 'really', 'bad', 'rap', 'music', 'movie', 'finally', 'little', 'traction', 'blood', 'spilled', 'second', 'death', 'particularly', 'brutal', 'thing', 'watch', 'downhill', 'point', 'though', 'filmmakers', 'dropped', 'pretense', 'character', 'development', 'there', 'was', 'just', 'had', 'everyone', 'start', 'killing', 'other', 'up', 'fairly', 'decent', 'ending', 'there', 'was', 'really', 'way', 'film', 'recover', 'disastrous', 'first', 'half.Dennis', 'Hopper', 'provide', 'unintentional', 'entertainment', 'though', 'what', 'assume', 'Irish', 'priest', 'habit', 'forgetting', 'fake', 'accent', 'when', 'actually', 'remember', 'use', 'more', 'Indian', 'chief', 'old', 'western', 'Irishman', 'guess', 'should', 'mention', 'fact', 'characters', 'are', 'European', 'so', ""'ve"", 'got', 'accents', 'flying', 'place', 'one.Definitely', 'entering', 'House', '9', 'should', 'beware', 'stereotypes', 'clich', 'eacute', 'accents', 'overused', 'horror', 'motifs', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'nice', 'nude', 'scene', 'two', 'help', 'rough', 'patches', 'either', 'were', 'only', 'two', 'women', 'film', 'would', 'even', 'want', 'imagine', 'naked', 'one', 'close', 'revealing', 'anything', 'also', 'bugs', 'Watcher', 'can', 'afford', 'big', 'escape-proof', 'house', 'five', 'million', 'dollar', 'payouts', 'cameras', 'installed', 'room', 'are', 'better', 'crappy', 'security', 'cameras', 'find', 'banks', 'think', ""'m"", 'being', 'pretty', 'darn', 'generous', 'giving', 'film', 'three', 'stars']",House of 9

Nine strangers are imprisoned by someone who tells them only one of them will live and they will be five million dollars richer.  But who will kill them?  We have the stock portfolio of participants:  the wisened saintly priest (a subdued but ineffective Dennis Hopper); the nice young dancer; the loud/foul mouthed rap singer; the effeminate fashion designer; the macho self righteous cop; the slutty girl; the addicted girl; and the not so happily married couple.  They're all extremely unlikeable, although the dancer isn't too bad, and the director forces us through two horrible songs, one an insipid powere ballad, the other an insipid rap song, and gives us long shots of the characters just sitting around.  When the killing start, they seem to come from nowhere and I found myself not caring who survived.  The ending is ridiculous:  no true resolution used for a shock effect that is simply dead.

I think the writers are mistaking fear, panic, and confusion that may cause people to snap at each other, with pure HATRED.

House of 9 is the first movie to do that to me this year. I was expecting just another not-very-good entry in the microbudget horror wars; what I ended up with was a fine (though not without flaws) absurdist drama, The Exterminating Angel on crack with gratuitous violence. I'll tell you now, before writing the rest of the review: you want to see this movie.For reasons of his own-- reasons of which neither the characters in the film, nor we, are ever apprised-- a nameless, unseen, very rich individual (voiced by Ella Enchanted's Jim Carter) abducts nine people and seals them in a mansion. Their mission: to be the only person to leave the house alive. The reward: five million dollars.While the movie suffers from some average-at-best acting and an overly facile ending you'll see coming a mile off, they're balanced out by a smashing script, brilliant set design, and a willingness to break every rule in the book. House of 9 isn't a horror film. It's not even a survival thriller, at least not for most of its length. The first half of the film is about the characters forming bonds, trying to learn the rules of their environment, and eventually devolving (with outside assistance). Luis Bunuel would probably not jump to anoint Steven Monroe his successor based on this film, but at least he's not spinning in his grave. If you go into this movie without expectations, you'll find yourself with a very pleasant surprise. *** ",4,Surprisingly good.,1172534400,"02 27, 2007",2007,1548,"['House', '9', 'Steven', 'R.', 'Monroe', '2004', 'Sometimes', 'go', 'movie', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'end', 'up', 'wowed', 'House', '9', 'first', 'movie', 'do', 'year', 'was', 'expecting', 'just', 'not-very-good', 'entry', 'microbudget', 'horror', 'wars', 'what', 'ended', 'up', 'was', 'fine', 'not', 'flaws', 'absurdist', 'drama', 'Exterminating', 'Angel', 'crack', 'gratuitous', 'violence', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'now', 'writing', 'rest', 'review', 'want', 'see', 'movie.For', 'reasons', 'own', 'reasons', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'ever', 'apprised', 'nameless', 'unseen', 'very', 'rich', 'individual', 'voiced', 'Ella', 'Enchanted', 'Jim', 'Carter', 'nine', 'people', 'seals', 'mansion', 'mission', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'leave', 'house', 'alive', 'reward', 'five', 'million', 'movie', 'suffers', 'average-at-best', 'acting', 'overly', 'facile', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'off', ""'re"", 'balanced', 'out', 'smashing', 'script', 'brilliant', 'set', 'design', 'willingness', 'break', 'rule', 'book', 'House', '9', ""n't"", 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'survival', 'thriller', 'least', 'not', 'most', 'length', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'characters', 'forming', 'bonds', 'trying', 'learn', 'rules', 'environment', 'eventually', 'devolving', 'outside', 'assistance', 'Luis', 'Bunuel', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'jump', 'anoint', 'Steven', 'Monroe', 'successor', 'based', 'film', 'least', 'not', 'spinning', 'grave', 'go', 'movie', 'expectations', ""'ll"", 'find', 'very', 'pleasant', 'surprise', '***']",House of 9

Strangers randomly kidnapped and put into a locked home with only one survivor to earn the $5 million prize. Simple enough. There is a fair amount of tension among the protagonists, and the performances are effective enough to be believable. The buildup is slow, pervasive, and really not predictable. There is always a sense that something could happen at any moment, and the movie preys on that atmosphere. And I was suprised by the ending, which revealed a truly creative twist.Having said that, the most horrifying part of this film is Dennis Hopper's attempt to maintain an Irish accent as the completely out-of-place priest. Just plain bad as his character is oddly juxtaposed against the other youthful cast members. And while there is tension, there is also a considerable amount of brooding, where the characters simply look unhappy, drink, or console each other quietly while overbearing music plays in the background. And for a film that feeds off the intensity of the feelings hopelessness, fear, and isolation, the deaths come suddenly over a brief period and in a rather hurried fashion.All in all, a good rental that ultimately hit its target despite a few significant stumbles along the way.

Yes, it's like Saw 2, but without the sadistic violence. It plays out like most reality shows. The participants party, get drunk, throw up, argue, and fight. It's about as boring as reality tv too, but at least here the participants die and don't just get voted out.Dennis Hopper feels misplaced as an irish priest, but he does add some weight and depth to the film.

Nine strangers find themselves trapped together inside a manor, where the voice of the unknown mastermind who's gathered them there soon addresses them over the intercom system.  Definately shades of both ""Saw"" and ""Cube"" already, and, apparantly, of a movie called ""My Little Eye"" as well (which I'm not familiar with) according to a blurb on the DVD case.Early attempts to break out of the house prove it's pretty well impossible to bust through the reinforced walls and shuttered windows, and then the mastermind on the intercom lays out the rules of the 'game' that's being recorded.  Nine people in.  Last one alive is the only one to leave, and leaves with a five million dollar prize.  Naturally, no one is thrilled at the concept layed out before them.From there, the way events unfold is in the hands of the 'players'; their abductor doesn't attempt to communicate further, although a strange device does provide food for the players, and the mastermind is apparantly still deciding what and when.  To encourage the group to enter tense situations and make the game interesting, the mastermind has chosen the participants well.  A couple of socially maladjusted, hostile individuals are in the mix to ensure that the group won't be able to smoothly function as a group toward a single goal (like getting free without killing each other) while a cop in the mix is the only one with a gun, sowing seeds of suspicion.  Dennis Hopper, in an interesting change of pace for the actor renowned for some very villainous roles, plays an Irish priest attempting to use reason and faith to convince the other members to resist playing into their captor's hands, and to resist the urge to mistrust and turn on one another.  Well acted, well written, and skillfully directed, with attention to detail and several surprise twists,  ""House Of 9"" distinguishes itself from other gems like Saw and Cube and emerges as a distinct, and great, movie of its own.  And one very much worth getting.",4,Intelligent And Riveting Horror Thriller,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,2048,"['One', 'could', 'be', 'excused', 'thinking', 'overly', 'familiar', 'Nine', 'strangers', 'find', 'trapped', 'together', 'manor', 'where', 'voice', 'unknown', 'mastermind', 'who', 'gathered', 'there', 'soon', 'intercom', 'system', 'Definately', 'shades', 'Saw', 'Cube', 'already', 'apparantly', 'movie', 'called', 'Little', 'Eye', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'according', 'blurb', 'DVD', 'case.Early', 'break', 'house', 'prove', 'pretty', 'well', 'impossible', 'bust', 'reinforced', 'walls', 'shuttered', 'windows', 'then', 'mastermind', 'intercom', 'out', 'rules', ""'game"", 'being', 'recorded', 'Nine', 'people', 'Last', 'one', 'alive', 'only', 'one', 'leave', 'five', 'million', 'dollar', 'prize', 'Naturally', 'one', 'thrilled', 'concept', 'layed', 'out', 'them.From', 'there', 'way', 'events', 'unfold', 'hands', ""'players"", 'abductor', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'communicate', 'further', 'strange', 'device', 'provide', 'food', 'players', 'mastermind', 'apparantly', 'still', 'deciding', 'what', 'when', 'encourage', 'group', 'enter', 'tense', 'situations', 'make', 'game', 'interesting', 'mastermind', 'chosen', 'participants', 'well', 'couple', 'socially', 'maladjusted', 'hostile', 'individuals', 'are', 'mix', 'ensure', 'group', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'smoothly', 'function', 'group', 'single', 'goal', 'getting', 'free', 'killing', 'other', 'cop', 'mix', 'only', 'one', 'gun', 'sowing', 'seeds', 'suspicion', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'interesting', 'change', 'pace', 'actor', 'renowned', 'very', 'villainous', 'roles', 'Irish', 'priest', 'attempting', 'use', 'reason', 'faith', 'convince', 'other', 'members', 'resist', 'playing', 'captor', 'hands', 'resist', 'urge', 'mistrust', 'turn', 'one', 'Well', 'acted', 'well', 'written', 'skillfully', 'directed', 'attention', 'detail', 'several', 'surprise', 'twists', 'House', '9', 'distinguishes', 'other', 'gems', 'Saw', 'Cube', 'distinct', 'great', 'movie', 'own', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'getting']",House of 9

958797,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000CGX7FW,trebe,"[0, 0]","A suspense thriller featuring strangers thrown together in a live or die situation, House of 9 (2005) is a semi-interesting watch, that proceeds to an expected conclusion.  The film features some stylishly executed violence, and the acting has some energy, however there are some significant problems with character behavior that isn't very believable.Nine people, apparently in the London vicinity, are abducted and taken to an unknown location.  It looks like the interior of a house, with bedrooms, corridors, and stairs to a lower level.  The only way out appears to be through a set of large double doors, which are locked.  Any other openings are sealed up.  Trapped inside, the group hears a man's voice coming from a speaker on the wall.  Their captor informs them that they are part of an experiment for his entertainment, and that only one person will walk out alive, and in return will receive five million dollars.  Cameras and microphones planted around the place, and he will be watching.Except for Francis (Hippolyte Girardot) and Cynthia (Julienne Davis), who are married, none of the people know each other.  The group includes Father Duffy (Dennis Hopper) a priest, policeman Jay (Raffaello Degruttoia), Lea (Kelly Brook) a dancer, Claire (Susie Amy) a pro tennis player, parolee Shona (Morven Christie), Max (Peter Capaldi) who designs clothes, and rapper Al B (Asher D).  Some food is provided, alcohol is available, and for some reason, Jay has a handgun, which makes him the de facto leader.  Rather than acting rationally, the group is prone to emotional outbursts and arguing, with certain members expressing open hostility.  Much like immature school kids, they fight over food, rooming arrangements, booze, and what to do.Things settle down, after the group fails in an attempt to break out of the space.  With escape apparently impossible, friction starts to build between certain members, eventually leading to violence and then an unexpected fatality.  From there, the willingness to kill seems to grow, as violence explodes suddenly, resulting in growing suspicion among the survivors.  Trust is in short supply, as one player makes a very determined effort to win the game.  Eventually one is left, the locked door opens, and the prize is claimed.With the goal of having the characters kill each other off, the directions the plot can take are limited, given that there is little real stimulus to drive them to kill.  What the writers come up with are overdramatic conflicts, dumb conversations, and characters behaving rudely and irrationally, constantly insulting each other.  The fighting for silly reasons, gets old fast.There are some good moments, as the cast tries to work with what they are given, but the constant bickering and bad dialog drags things down.  Dennis Hopper lays it on thick playing a peace-loving man of God, who then picks up the gun, but the over the top acting award goes to Hippolyte Girardot, who as Francis, gets into the spirit of the game early, and plays it hard with calculating cunning.  As the sensible god-fearing one, Lea manages to avoid conflicts with the other females.House of 9 isn't a disaster, but it isn't great either.  Production values are good, and the action sequences and kills are well done, though with a bit too much quick cutting.  The characters are not believable, but the animated performances generally hold your interest, and when it comes to the killing, nearly everyone gets a chance to play.  If you are into the survival of the fittest scenario, the film is probably worth a look.  The widescreen presentation is not subtitled, and there are no extras on the DVD besides a trailer.",3,taking the opportunity to kill...,1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,3678,"['suspense', 'thriller', 'featuring', 'strangers', 'thrown', 'together', 'live', 'die', 'situation', 'House', '9', '2005', 'semi-interesting', 'watch', 'expected', 'conclusion', 'film', 'stylishly', 'executed', 'violence', 'acting', 'energy', 'however', 'are', 'significant', 'problems', 'character', 'behavior', ""n't"", 'very', 'believable.Nine', 'people', 'apparently', 'London', 'vicinity', 'are', 'abducted', 'taken', 'unknown', 'location', 'interior', 'house', 'bedrooms', 'corridors', 'stairs', 'lower', 'level', 'only', 'way', 'be', 'set', 'large', 'double', 'doors', 'are', 'locked', 'other', 'openings', 'are', 'sealed', 'up', 'Trapped', 'group', 'man', 'voice', 'coming', 'speaker', 'wall', 'captor', 'are', 'part', 'experiment', 'entertainment', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'will', 'walk', 'alive', 'return', 'will', 'receive', 'five', 'million', 'dollars', 'Cameras', 'microphones', 'planted', 'place', 'will', 'be', 'watching.Except', 'Francis', 'Hippolyte', 'Girardot', 'Cynthia', 'Julienne', 'Davis', 'who', 'are', 'married', 'none', 'people', 'know', 'other', 'group', 'Father', 'Duffy', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'priest', 'policeman', 'Jay', 'Raffaello', 'Degruttoia', 'Lea', 'Kelly', 'Brook', 'dancer', 'Claire', 'Susie', 'Amy', 'pro', 'tennis', 'player', 'parolee', 'Shona', 'Morven', 'Christie', 'Max', 'Peter', 'Capaldi', 'who', 'clothes', 'rapper', 'Al', 'B', 'Asher', 'D', 'food', 'provided', 'alcohol', 'available', 'reason', 'Jay', 'handgun', 'de', 'facto', 'leader', 'Rather', 'acting', 'rationally', 'group', 'prone', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'arguing', 'certain', 'members', 'expressing', 'open', 'hostility', 'Much', 'immature', 'school', 'kids', 'fight', 'food', 'rooming', 'arrangements', 'booze', 'what', 'do.Things', 'settle', 'down', 'group', 'attempt', 'break', 'space', 'escape', 'apparently', 'impossible', 'friction', 'starts', 'build', 'certain', 'members', 'eventually', 'leading', 'violence', 'then', 'unexpected', 'fatality', 'there', 'willingness', 'kill', 'grow', 'violence', 'suddenly', 'resulting', 'growing', 'suspicion', 'survivors', 'Trust', 'short', 'supply', 'one', 'player', 'very', 'determined', 'effort', 'win', 'game', 'Eventually', 'one', 'left', 'locked', 'door', 'opens', 'prize', 'claimed.With', 'goal', 'having', 'characters', 'kill', 'other', 'off', 'directions', 'plot', 'can', 'take', 'are', 'limited', 'given', 'little', 'real', 'stimulus', 'drive', 'kill', 'What', 'writers', 'come', 'up', 'are', 'overdramatic', 'conflicts', 'dumb', 'conversations', 'characters', 'behaving', 'rudely', 'irrationally', 'constantly', 'insulting', 'other', 'fighting', 'silly', 'reasons', 'old', 'are', 'good', 'moments', 'cast', 'tries', 'work', 'what', 'are', 'given', 'constant', 'bickering', 'bad', 'dialog', 'things', 'down', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'thick', 'playing', 'peace-loving', 'man', 'God', 'who', 'then', 'up', 'gun', 'top', 'acting', 'award', 'Hippolyte', 'Girardot', 'who', 'Francis', 'spirit', 'game', 'early', 'hard', 'calculating', 'cunning', 'sensible', 'god-fearing', 'one', 'Lea', 'avoid', 'conflicts', 'other', 'females.House', '9', ""n't"", 'disaster', ""n't"", 'great', 'Production', 'values', 'are', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'kills', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'quick', 'cutting', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'believable', 'animated', 'performances', 'generally', 'hold', 'interest', 'when', 'killing', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'chance', 'play', 'are', 'survival', 'fittest', 'scenario', 'film', 'probably', 'worth', 'look', 'widescreen', 'presentation', 'not', 'subtitled', 'are', 'extras', 'DVD', 'trailer']",House of 9
