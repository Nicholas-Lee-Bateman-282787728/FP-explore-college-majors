There are NO English subtitles for the hearing impaired. I'm not totally deaf, but most of the characters in this series talk very fast, and their enunciation is not that great. Part 1 included subs in French, Spanish, and English for hearing impaired. In part 2 they dropped this essential feature. WHY??? A subtitle track is a simple text file with timing script. Less than 1 MB of space. The show had closed captions available on the broadcast TV but NOT on the DVD collectors edition??? I am so sick of this!!! I will be re-selling this set, and waiting for a re-issue with proper features.Please write to ABC Family Channel, Paul Lee, President, 3800 West Alameda Ave., Burbank, CA 91505 and let them know your concerns, Thank you!(La Femme Nikita did the same thing. Seasons 1-4 all have English subs. But not on Season 5.
