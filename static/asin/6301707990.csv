262697,A6GMEO3VRY51S,6301707990,microjoe,"[4, 4]","Farmer McIver (Charles Aidman) has gone to join the American Civil War as a Confederate soldier, and left his young son Jamie in charge of their remote wooded hilltop farm. That includes his mother (Patricia Crowley) his brother, and his sister SueEllen (Jodie Foster). He earns a bounty to pay farm taxes by capturing a mountain lion, but then the local adult bully is after him since he wanted the prize himself. Then the bully takes an unhealthy interest in his mother even though there is not word that his father has died. Jamie is forced to chase the man out of their home by gunpoint to save his mother. Making matters worse, an unruly group of deserter soldiers begin marauding the local farms, and make their way to the McIver place, displacing the family. Jamie is determined to fight back but his family is afraid for him. But will Jamie's dad return in time to retake their land? The story deals with some very serious issues. You understand very quickly that Jamies mother's may be asaulted by some very bad men if he doesn't intervene, and yet he is so young to have this huge burden. It is a real story of bravery in harsh conditions, very well done and suspenseful.BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA: Directed by Vincent McVeety,  For a very young Jodie Foster, this was her first of 5 projects for Disney over the years. This story was originally filmed as 2 episodes for ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show, airing March 1 and 8, 1970. It was re-edited into a continuous movie, and released to the overseas theater audience in 1972.",5,Dad's gone off to war and left me in charge,1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,1554,"['Farmer', 'McIver', 'Charles', 'Aidman', 'gone', 'join', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'Confederate', 'soldier', 'left', 'young', 'son', 'Jamie', 'charge', 'remote', 'wooded', 'hilltop', 'farm', 'mother', 'Patricia', 'Crowley', 'brother', 'sister', 'SueEllen', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'bounty', 'pay', 'farm', 'taxes', 'capturing', 'mountain', 'lion', 'then', 'local', 'adult', 'bully', 'wanted', 'prize', 'Then', 'bully', 'unhealthy', 'interest', 'mother', 'even', 'not', 'word', 'father', 'died', 'Jamie', 'forced', 'chase', 'man', 'home', 'gunpoint', 'save', 'mother', 'Making', 'matters', 'worse', 'unruly', 'group', 'deserter', 'soldiers', 'begin', 'marauding', 'local', 'farms', 'make', 'way', 'McIver', 'place', 'displacing', 'family', 'Jamie', 'determined', 'fight', 'back', 'family', 'afraid', 'will', 'Jamie', 'dad', 'return', 'time', 'retake', 'land', 'story', 'deals', 'very', 'serious', 'issues', 'understand', 'very', 'quickly', 'Jamies', 'may', 'be', 'asaulted', 'very', 'bad', 'men', ""n't"", 'intervene', 'yet', 'so', 'young', 'have', 'huge', 'burden', 'real', 'story', 'bravery', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'suspenseful.BEHIND', 'THE', 'SCENES', 'TRIVIA', 'Directed', 'Vincent', 'McVeety', 'very', 'young', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'was', 'first', '5', 'projects', 'Disney', 'years', 'story', 'was', 'originally', 'filmed', '2', 'episodes', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'Disney', 'television', 'show', 'airing', 'March', '1', '8', '1970', 'was', 're-edited', 'continuous', 'movie', 'released', 'overseas', 'theater', 'audience', '1972']",Menace on the Mountain VHS
262698,A1N4OFD1OGTVFI,6301707990,Mr. Dudley J. Tate,"[0, 0]","""Menace on the Mountain"" is another Walt Disney adventure story told in thebest tradition of early movies.Made in 1970 and set in the closing days of the Civil War, it is the storyof 14 year old Jamie McIver (Mitch Vogel) who has been the man of the housesupporting and watching over his mum (Patricia Crowley) and his small brother(Eric Shea) and sister (Jodie Foster) whilst his father (Albert Salmi) hasbeen away fighting in the Confederate Army.The movie is a serious look at life in those days through the eyes of youngJamie and it shows in the always serious expression on the boy's face.I guess that being the bread winner for the family, his concern for the fateof his father and family with the steadily approaching war, his having to dealwith outlaws and the hardships of life, must take its toll on one so young buthe bravely sticks to the task.Hoss Timmerlake is a lawless and ruthless man who is the leader of a group ofarmy deserters who are terrorising the countryside and he delights intormenting Jamie and his mother because of previous ill-will encounters.  Heand his cut-throat band of outlaws eventually take over the McIver home anduse it as a fort because of its strategic position and in the processforcefully ejects the McIver family.With the end of the war, Jamie makes friends with a Union Army officer who'slife he once saved.  In return for kindness shown, the officer offers hishelp and that of the army to drive the outlaws from the family home and tocapture them.Jamie's father returns home at the end of the war and engages in a war ofhis own as he helps the Union Army to drive out the outlaws.  He is proudof his son's valiant efforts during his absence.Now for the first time on DVD and digitally restored, ""Menace on theMountain"" is a good family movie and watch out for Jamie's pet pig""Blossom"".
