962060,AERLH695G6963,B000CS45OW,Fred Gonzales,"[0, 0]","I've been a fan of Alyssa Milano ever since her ""Who's the Boss?"" days, and bless her heart, because I guess this little movie was the best her agent had for her that month.  She and Cameron Bancroft play a couple who get left out in the cold, literally, at their temporary housing for their temporary jobs in the very isolated Alaskan bush, then head for civilization after some miscommunication about who was supposed to bring their next batch of food and supplies.  It's really another case of, if you get lost, stay where you are, but of course, they didn't; otherwise, there'd be no movie.  It's definitely good to know that there was a real-life couple who managed ""To Brave Alaska"" and made it out alive.  It's just too bad that this movie didn't do justice to their, I'm sure, extremely desperate and dangerous survival story.  The acting is fine; it just didn't stir my emotions and didn't have as much white-knuckle suspense as you'd expect, leaving something to be desired (I also wondered why they ate toothpaste because, hungry or not, toothpaste can definitely be harmful if ingested).  It's just good enough, but you'll probably be more entertained with an ""I Shouldn't Be Alive"" episode.",3,"Passing grade, but I'm sure the real-life survival story was more gripping and harrowing.",1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,1203,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Alyssa', 'Milano', 'ever', 'Who', 'Boss', 'days', 'heart', 'guess', 'little', 'movie', 'was', 'best', 'agent', 'had', 'month', 'Cameron', 'Bancroft', 'play', 'couple', 'who', 'get', 'left', 'out', 'cold', 'literally', 'temporary', 'housing', 'temporary', 'jobs', 'very', 'isolated', 'Alaskan', 'bush', 'then', 'head', 'civilization', 'miscommunication', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'bring', 'next', 'batch', 'food', 'supplies', 'really', 'case', 'get', 'lost', 'stay', 'where', 'are', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'be', 'movie', 'definitely', 'good', 'know', 'was', 'real-life', 'couple', 'who', 'managed', 'Brave', 'Alaska', 'made', 'out', 'alive', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', ""'m"", 'sure', 'extremely', 'desperate', 'dangerous', 'survival', 'story', 'acting', 'fine', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'stir', 'emotions', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'white-knuckle', 'suspense', ""'d"", 'expect', 'leaving', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'also', 'wondered', 'why', 'ate', 'toothpaste', 'hungry', 'not', 'toothpaste', 'can', 'definitely', 'be', 'harmful', 'ingested', 'just', 'good', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'entertained', 'Should', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Alive', 'episode']",To Brave Alaska
