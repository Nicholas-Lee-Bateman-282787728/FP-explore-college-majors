350439,AAVVI0JO946NU,6303011594,James E Hook,"[0, 0]","This classic British film is rereleased in the (optionally) dubbed and subtitled Italian version in a Region 2 release. It joins three other versions in my collection, including those with the Little Lord played by Mary Pickford and Mickey Rooney. It is by far the best.This version of Little Lord Fauntleroy stars a young newcomer Ricky Schroeder paired with a seasoned Alec Guinness (then in the midst of his 'Obi-wan' Kenobi role in Star Wars). Guinness is the aging, ill, and tight-fisted British Lord who decides to send to America for his grandson. He hopes to separate him from everything American, including his loving mother, and make him into his heir. But the little lord cannot suppress his youthful optimism and joy for life. It is he who converts his grandfather, and all seems well until a new claimant to the Lordship comes forth. Along the way the story points out in vivid fashion the contrast between wealth of the Lord an his manor and the squalor of his tenants. A great and timeless story, well told in this version. (For a slightly different twist on the story, look into the equally enjoyable, though less accurate, Die Kleine Lady, a 2012 Austria-German Release, where its the lady of the castle and her 12 year old granddaughter.)Il Piccolo Lord has been restored and color enhanced and it looks great.

While there is a lot to recommend both the Mary Pickford version and the Freddie Barthlomew version, neither of them has Alec Guinness.
