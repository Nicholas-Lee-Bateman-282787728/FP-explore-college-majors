I think the new voice cast is okay, though I much rather wished the original English cast would have returned to make the movie more funnier. It would've been nice if the movie could've shown Sakura and Shaoran sharing their first kiss just like in the book after catching her and interesting to see during the closing credits little scenes of the main characters reuniting after the conflict is resolved to show that Sakura and Shaoran are now a couple. Mona Marshall nails her performance as a young male character once again. Good show, ms. Marshall, good show. For any new fan who wants to see view the anime series and read the books, I totally recommend this movie to everyone.",3,"Good, but I do wish things were done a little bit better.",1401580800,"06 1, 2014",2014,702,"['love', 'movie', 'think', 'new', 'voice', 'cast', 'okay', 'much', 'rather', 'wished', 'original', 'English', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'returned', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'funnier', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'Sakura', 'Shaoran', 'sharing', 'first', 'kiss', 'just', 'book', 'catching', 'interesting', 'see', 'closing', 'little', 'scenes', 'main', 'characters', 'reuniting', 'conflict', 'resolved', 'show', 'Sakura', 'Shaoran', 'are', 'now', 'couple', 'Mona', 'Marshall', 'performance', 'young', 'male', 'character', 'once', 'again', 'Good', 'show', 'ms.', 'Marshall', 'good', 'show', 'new', 'fan', 'who', 'see', 'anime', 'series', 'read', 'books', 'totally', 'recommend', 'movie', 'everyone']",N/A
773967,A1UB81CPBWN5IC,B0000C8ARJ,Elizabeth,"[5, 5]","This movie is full with love and action. Cardcaptor Sakura is maybe in Japanese, but it takes you to a new world. Even if its a cartoon, its a nice anime. This movie I thought was as good as the first movie. I really like the colors on here, they make it stand out. The structure is nicely done. Put that aside and lets start out with the basics.If CC (Carly Mckillip, Jordin Kilik etc.) was acting on this and Nelvana was on this, I bet they would cut every single part of Sakura and Shoaron having a crush on each other. I bet it would be just a half in hour movie. I bet that on the end, Sakura would be glad that Shoaron is back and instead of saying &quot;I love you&quot; to Shoaron, I would think Sakura AVALON would say &quot;Im glad you back!&quot; or &quot;We finally captured all of the cards!&quot; or something. This is not waste of your money. I promise.This movie is about the sixth grader Sakura who is in a play. She plays as the princess! The lead role! Shoaron and Meiling come back from Hong Kong when Sakura tries to tell her true feelings to Shoaron. Some strange presence that Sakura senses seems like its a Clow Card and it is... the last and final one called &quot;The Sealed Card&quot;.

773969,ATS4V6NFTX3RE,B0000C8ARJ,Lisa F. Curtiss,"[18, 23]","I would recommend watching this in Japanese with English subtitles. For this movie, it seems the voices are not all the same. Kero doesn't sound as deep voiced as he did in the series. Sakura's and Madison's voices are different as well. I didn't wait to see if Li's or Meilin's voices had changed or not. I switched over to the Japanese dialouge.In seeing this movie, some things made sense more that they didn't seem to in the dubbed series. As in why Li always seemed to run like the wind whenever he was around Julian. Julian isn't all that he seems to be.Meilin has also taken a big turn in her personality for the better. I really liked her character in this movie.Kero is also great in this movie. Providing insight to the sealed card, and comedy relief regarding his enormous appitite.Throughout the whole movie, Sakura looks for the chance to tell Li her deepest feelings for him. Will she finally get to tell him before it's too late and everything disappears? Including those she loves?Wonderful story. A must see! Go get it!

773971,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B0000C8ARJ,P. Hardy,"[0, 11]","When I first watched this DVD, I was expecting the same good ol' American dub courtesy of Nelvana, so you can say I was surprised to find out it wasn't. Which is why I don't like a majority sequels; they change pretty much everything to actors, voice-actors and the personality of characters in the story which sort of kills any expectations or enjoyment of even considering to watch a sequel. That aside Cardcaptor Sakura: the sealed card continues where the series left off, with a very corny opening with. Sakura is sill brooding over Li's departure to Hong Kong and the only way she seems to quell this wanting to see Li is to watch a bunch of tapes made by her queer friend Tomoyo--- [Madison in Nelvana's CCS version, Cardcaptors] who thinks pretty much everything and everyone (especially Sakura and Li ;) are so cute! Then one day, Li and his cousin Meling suddenly appear out of nowhere and Sakura finds herself faced with task of telling Li how she really feels about him. Throughout the movie you have to sit and watch Sakura's inability to confess her true feelings to Li, while at the same time figure out why her ""Sakura"" cards and various objects and people are all vanishing with each passing day, however, its no mystery as to what's behind it.The fillers in this movie are the constant ploys like Meling and Tomoyo playing matchmaker and Sakura's constant stalling to confess to Li, which becomes repetitive. You want to tell her to go on and confess already. The music in the movie is a tad too childish for my liking, the action in the CCS2 is few and far between, most of the so-called 'action-moment's' consist of Sakura trying to persuade the 'enemy' to stop what its doing and running for her life while her Guardian's along with Li have to save her from peril. The main focus and plot (if you wanna call it that) of this movie is the intolerable, so-predicable romance between Sakura and Li, which gets really boring in and of itself. I mean, the movie was fun to watch at times and had some redeemable moments but the cutsey-cute atmosphere is almost too sweet to even stomach. The Japanese dub remains the same, while English dub is performed by Zang Boom entertainment: which is the English dubs major downfall. While ZBE maintains the original names (no matter how badly pronounced) of the characters, Nelvana did a better job in the voice-acting and music department, aside from the fact that they edited CCS. All in all, the sealed card will only please Otaku fans of CCS, but if your someone who never minded the edited version Cardcaptors, then you'll find the English dub and movie very unfamiliar ground and comfortable to listen to.----- [a 3 out of 5]",3,My  younger sister's Anime.....,1101513600,"11 27, 2004",2004,2688,"['When', 'first', 'watched', 'DVD', 'was', 'expecting', 'same', 'good', 'ol', 'American', 'dub', 'courtesy', 'Nelvana', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'was', ""n't"", 'Which', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'majority', 'sequels', 'change', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'actors', 'voice-actors', 'personality', 'characters', 'story', 'sort', 'kills', 'expectations', 'enjoyment', 'even', 'considering', 'watch', 'sequel', 'aside', 'Cardcaptor', 'Sakura', 'sealed', 'card', 'where', 'series', 'left', 'off', 'very', 'corny', 'opening', 'Sakura', 'sill', 'brooding', 'Li', 'departure', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'only', 'way', 'quell', 'wanting', 'see', 'Li', 'watch', 'bunch', 'tapes', 'made', 'queer', 'friend', 'Tomoyo', '[', 'Madison', 'Nelvana', 'CCS', 'version', 'Cardcaptors', ']', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'everyone', 'especially', 'Sakura', 'Li', 'are', 'so', 'cute', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'Li', 'cousin', 'Meling', 'suddenly', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'Sakura', 'faced', 'task', 'telling', 'Li', 'how', 'really', 'feels', 'movie', 'have', 'sit', 'watch', 'Sakura', 'inability', 'confess', 'true', 'feelings', 'Li', 'same', 'time', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Sakura', 'cards', 'various', 'objects', 'people', 'are', 'vanishing', 'passing', 'day', 'however', 'mystery', 'what', 'it.The', 'fillers', 'movie', 'are', 'constant', 'ploys', 'Meling', 'Tomoyo', 'playing', 'matchmaker', 'Sakura', 'constant', 'stalling', 'confess', 'Li', 'repetitive', 'want', 'tell', 'go', 'confess', 'already', 'music', 'movie', 'tad', 'too', 'childish', 'liking', 'action', 'CCS2', 'few', 'far', 'most', 'so-called', ""'action-moment"", 'consist', 'Sakura', 'trying', 'persuade', ""'enemy"", 'stop', 'what', 'doing', 'running', 'life', 'Guardian', 'Li', 'have', 'save', 'peril', 'main', 'focus', 'plot', 'wan', 'call', 'movie', 'intolerable', 'so-predicable', 'romance', 'Sakura', 'Li', 'really', 'boring', 'mean', 'movie', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'times', 'had', 'redeemable', 'moments', 'cutsey-cute', 'atmosphere', 'almost', 'too', 'sweet', 'even', 'stomach', 'Japanese', 'dub', 'same', 'English', 'dub', 'performed', 'Zang', 'Boom', 'entertainment', 'English', 'dubs', 'major', 'downfall', 'ZBE', 'original', 'names', 'matter', 'how', 'badly', 'pronounced', 'characters', 'Nelvana', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'voice-acting', 'music', 'department', 'aside', 'fact', 'edited', 'CCS', 'sealed', 'card', 'will', 'only', 'please', 'Otaku', 'fans', 'CCS', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'minded', 'edited', 'version', 'Cardcaptors', 'then', ""'ll"", 'find', 'English', 'dub', 'movie', 'very', 'unfamiliar', 'ground', 'comfortable', 'listen', 'to.', '[', '3', '5', ']']",N/A
