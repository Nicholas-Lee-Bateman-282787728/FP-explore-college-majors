It seems to ramble along with characters coming in and exiting as needed.  Interesting and not disturbing but not a film you'd rave about to friends saying that they must see it.  If you're into old films with predictable lines and action capitalising on the skills of well-known actors, then see it - but you probably won't watch it more than on two wet non-consecutive evenings spread some time apart.",2,The Kingfisher Film,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,552,"['Strong', 'acting', 'main', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'narrative', 'purpose', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'excite', 'viewer', 'ramble', 'along', 'characters', 'coming', 'exiting', 'needed', 'Interesting', 'not', 'disturbing', 'not', 'film', ""'d"", 'rave', 'friends', 'saying', 'must', 'see', ""'re"", 'old', 'films', 'predictable', 'lines', 'action', 'capitalising', 'skills', 'well-known', 'actors', 'then', 'see', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'more', 'two', 'wet', 'non-consecutive', 'evenings', 'spread', 'time', 'apart']",N/A

Where is he/she now and is it possible for providence to give us a last opportunity to correct this?Three great actors play out the scenario. As Cecil (Rex Harrison) discovers that his love Evelyn (Wendy Hiller) that getaway 50 years ago has been recently widowed and is passing by his home on the way from the funeral.For 50 years Evelyn was married to an avid golfer who died on the seventeenth hole. Why did they get married? For 50 years Cecil decided never to marry and lived with his servant Hawkins (Cyril Cusack) who is not looking forward to the impending meeting.This film is based on ""The kingfisher: A comedy in two acts"" by William Douglas Home and we are voyeurs watching these people and of course the kingfisher. You will have to watch again for all the nuances'.

This television film was supposed to be something very witty and sophisticated, something like Oscar Wilde would have written.  It isn't.  It's quite dull, in fact, and appears to have as its point the fashionable cliche that homosexual love is as important as heterosexual love.  Or something like that.  Hiller, Harrison, and Cusak (especially the latter) are predictably marvelous, but you could almost see the script they're going through.

The performances are top-notch (as one would expect with such virtuoso actors), the setting is gorgeous; I sometimes watch it just because it puts me in the unparalleled beauty of the English countryside  and the Country House, and the dialogue is pithy and funny.

Why else would they use a line like ""...appears to have as its point the fashionable cliche that homosexual love is as important as heterosexual love."" And then follow it with, ""Or something like that.""This film is based on the stage play. It is small. It is quiet. It is literate. And it is very funny. And yes, the acting is splendid. A great turn for actors in their seventies/eighties. Remember - it is next to impossible to find three lead roles when you're that age.The sole complaint is that the transfer, from film to DVD, is not the best. For the first 20 minutes or so the film moves slightly up and down - a function of the film not being locked in its gate. This calms down soon after. Most people won't even notice it, with the proliferation of 'moving cow' camera techniques, these days.Pay no attention to the homophobic, inappropriate remarks bizarrely expressed by the other reviewer.

I did not see that talking animal one but just about all the rest are pretty good. He has that British dry sense of humour that appeals to us Brits. It was short but makes a good movie for quilting.

Now I have to really recommend it more strongly.I saw Rex Harrison & Claudette Colbert in this play on Broadway - what a thrill.  Dame Wendy Hiller will also be great in the role, so I'm excited even though I haven't seen the movie yet.  See Dame Wendy in Pygmallion (the original G.B.
