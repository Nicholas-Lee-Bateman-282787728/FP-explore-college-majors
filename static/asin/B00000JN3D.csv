Jackie is great as the lonely millionaire who has digital fish (heehe) and has only two fight scenes (no stunts) with this really cool australian guy, definetly worth a watch, but not Jackies best in terms of what his fans are use too.Miracles- I dunno if this DVD comes with the original language cut or not, so I'll stick to the film.
