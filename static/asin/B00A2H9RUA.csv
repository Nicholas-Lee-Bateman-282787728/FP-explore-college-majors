Did Middlestein , an associate of Adolf Eichman, successfully avoid the Neuremberg trials and keep up the facade by keeping on the surface a friendship with an Israeli German Jew unwitting to the role that Middlestein had in the war? Were there not any Germans during the war that were willing to oppose Hitlers final solution even Germans who had close relationships with Jewish friends and neighbors and shared the same meals? Today Germany the country and Israel are allies , and Germany has made a true effort at reconciliation and that has to be commended.  Yet, for a true reconciliation between Jews and Germans to happen, the past can't be swept under the carpet because that will mean the Germans did not really learn the lessons of their past even though they might be atoning for them in a collective way. As my father was a holocaust survivor from Germany who came to the USA , he never held a true malice to the German people even though his immediate family were sacrificed. He still enjoyed German food , language , and culture as did many of my German family relatives who survived, so I can totally understand the needs of the German Israeli grandfather and grandmother to travel to Germany, a country they loved but was betrayed them.  In my book "" Leaving Home, Going Home,Returning Home: A Hebrew American's Sojourn in the land of Israel"" I myself also talk about my own visits to Germany and my encounters with young German's who to my surprise treated me very very well. I also saw this in the heart felt greetings the Israeli family had by the German families in the movie. Yet, it is time for Germans to deal completely with their past honestly for themselves and not live in denial- so that what happened in Germany can really never ever happen again. I understand that it might be painful to dig up the not so distant past. Yet, the Holocaust was painful too and will be with the Jewish people for generations to come.",5,For true German Jewish reconciliation there has to be a true recognition of the past,1370995200,"06 12, 2013",2013,2018,"['was', 'very', 'interesting', 'story', 'brought', 'mind', 'questions', 'Did', 'Middlestein', 'associate', 'Adolf', 'Eichman', 'successfully', 'avoid', 'Neuremberg', 'trials', 'keep', 'up', 'facade', 'keeping', 'surface', 'friendship', 'Israeli', 'German', 'Jew', 'unwitting', 'role', 'Middlestein', 'had', 'war', 'Were', 'there', 'not', 'Germans', 'war', 'were', 'willing', 'oppose', 'Hitlers', 'final', 'solution', 'even', 'Germans', 'who', 'had', 'close', 'relationships', 'Jewish', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'shared', 'same', 'meals', 'Today', 'Germany', 'country', 'Israel', 'are', 'allies', 'Germany', 'made', 'true', 'effort', 'reconciliation', 'be', 'commended', 'true', 'reconciliation', 'Jews', 'Germans', 'happen', 'past', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'swept', 'carpet', 'will', 'mean', 'Germans', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'learn', 'lessons', 'past', 'even', 'might', 'be', 'atoning', 'collective', 'way', 'father', 'was', 'holocaust', 'survivor', 'Germany', 'who', 'came', 'USA', 'never', 'held', 'true', 'malice', 'German', 'people', 'even', 'immediate', 'family', 'were', 'sacrificed', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'German', 'food', 'language', 'culture', 'did', 'many', 'German', 'family', 'relatives', 'who', 'survived', 'can', 'totally', 'understand', 'needs', 'German', 'Israeli', 'grandfather', 'grandmother', 'travel', 'Germany', 'country', 'loved', 'was', 'betrayed', 'book', 'Leaving', 'Home', 'Going', 'Home', 'Returning', 'Home', 'Hebrew', 'American', 'Sojourn', 'land', 'Israel', 'also', 'talk', 'own', 'visits', 'Germany', 'encounters', 'young', 'German', 'who', 'surprise', 'treated', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'also', 'saw', 'heart', 'felt', 'greetings', 'Israeli', 'family', 'had', 'German', 'families', 'movie', 'time', 'Germans', 'deal', 'completely', 'past', 'honestly', 'not', 'live', 'denial-', 'what', 'happened', 'Germany', 'can', 'really', 'never', 'ever', 'happen', 'again', 'understand', 'might', 'be', 'painful', 'dig', 'up', 'not', 'so', 'distant', 'past', 'Holocaust', 'was', 'painful', 'too', 'will', 'be', 'Jewish', 'people', 'generations', 'come']",The Flat
1604383,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B00A2H9RUA,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","Even today, new stories about the Holocaust rise up out of the ashes and demand to be told. Each voice is worthy, every story worth telling. And some are more interesting than others.THE FLAT is certainly interesting, even important. But it falls short of being the compelling experience the filmmaker hoped it to be. The reason for this, in this reviewer&#8217;s opinion, is that there is no pay off. Granted, this is a documentary, where there are no guarantees as to the outcome of the story. One simply jumps in and hopes for the best. Arnon Goldfinger must&#8217;ve made a hasty decision to pursue his grandparents relationship with a high ranking Nazi and his wife when he discovered evidence of their friendship while going through his recently deceased grandmother&#8217;s belongings in her flat. (If it wasn&#8217;t a hasty decision, then that would mean the footage of his family going through his grandmother&#8217;s belongings was staged).It is difficult to understand the myriad of emotions he and his family must have felt at this revelation, but clearly, at least for Goldfinger, the stakes are high, even if his family members&#8217; reactions to various memorabilia are, for the most part, subdued.One can&#8217;t help suspect that as events unfold the filmmaker was hoping for some catharsis to take place: either his mother breaking down and screaming &#8220;how could they?&#8221; or the daughter of the grandparents&#8217; Nazi friend shrieking &#8220;it can&#8217;t be true!&#8221; This is a reasonable hope, for therein lies the stuff of good drama.Sadly, for the sake of the documentary, this does not occur. Goldfinger voices his disappointment with his mother&#8217;s guarded reaction (she knew nothing about this relationship), but the rest of the time he looks dazed, as if he cannot believe no one is expressing outrage.Perhaps a more objective perspective on the part of the filmmaker might&#8217;ve served the story better; something the best documentaries seem to have in common.THE FLAT is, to be frank, a little flat, dramatically.

His historical novel puts you in the thick of people destructing and reinventing one's self after the chaos of war.My perspective is born out of spending countless hours with victims of spiritual and social holocaust.  This film requires a cognitive commitment to become involved and develop your own conclusions.  At the end you have insights and more questions than answers about friendships surviving deceptive-evil times.  It is a window into the gray shades of nationalistic ties with a youthful love of what was.  There are multiple intersections between Germans and Jews,  with their respective homes.  The truthful relationships are extraordinary, you can see real pain at the intersection of what happened and mystified faces of adult children left with unexplained history.  The documentary nears the end metaphorically in the cemetery with discussion around the mother's denial, over lost (or destroyed/stolen) grave stones, under the divinely choreographed weeping rain.  Evil comes to lie, deceive and destroy for power.It is important to put the WWII holocaust into a historical context.  Spanish Inquisition killed about 1.4 million Jews, others fled to the Americas or converted to Christianity or died.  There were and will be more holocaust to come.  To bring about the ""Communist Utopia"" estimates of ""Mass killings ... during twentieth century ... numbering between 85 and 100 million."" see Mass killings under Communist regimes Wikipedia.  Killing of innocent people for religious ideals including Socialism and Communism (belief in man/state is god) is nothing new.This documentary is less about the holocaust and more about two couples surviving evil, one of the couples missing the homeland of their youth, retaining a friendship that surpasses evil and all the while being ""good Germans"" which is a moral standard.  As a psychologist, it left my head spinning.  I don't think Mildenstein was evil or sinister, like so many collateral victims of evil he was trying to get through.  Evil people jump at the chance for more power and responsibility to due evil.  Mildenstein moved away (my Adlerian view) from evil in 1937.  The psychologist in the film offered Arnon an interesting yet unsupportable synopsis.Spoiler Alert - Don't read further until after watching the film.  Comments and more questions are welcomed.  Questions for the viewer: Did Mildenstein foresee what was coming and knowing Jews loved Germany (like the Tuchlers) save their lives by forced expulsion?  Was Mildenstein and/or Tuchler spies?  Why did they initiate their friendship after the war?  Was Mildenstein playing the party to protect more Jews?  Did he seek to escape direct involvement in fascist activities in 1937?  What did he bring to Coca-Cola that other candidates for employment couldn't?  At the end why are the gravestones missing?

1604401,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00A2H9RUA,Turfseer,"[26, 32]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Imagine that your grandmother has just passed away and your family is cleaning out her apartment. Amidst all the stuff your grandmother has collected, you find a tantalizing and shocking newspaper article involving your grandparents that you never heard about before from any other family member including your mother. This is essentially the set-up for 'The Flat', a fascinating new documentary by Israeli filmmaker Arnon Goldfinger.Goldfinger's grandparents, Gerda and Kurt Tuchler, were German Jews who emigrated to Palestine (now Israel) in 1936 after the Nazis forced them out. The article was from a virulent Nazi newspaper, Der Angriff, from 1934, which chronicles a trip made by a high Nazi official, Leopold von Mildenstein, to Palestine. The article features photos of Mildenstein traveling to Palestine with Goldfinger's grandparents.The mystery is not only why this SS man would go to Palestine with two Jews but why Goldfinger's grandparents would accompany him. Furthermore, Goldfinger discovers that his grandparents visited Mildenstein in Germany AFTER World War II numerous times and kept up a friendship with him and his wife.The documentary brings out the fact that in 1934 the Nazi policy of 'The Final Solution' (i.e. the extermination of the Jewish people) had not been developed and there was some consideration of deporting German Jews to Palestine. Mildenstein apparently was on a scouting mission to see if deportation was a feasible solution to the ""Jewish Question"". Mildenstein actually headed the SS Office of Jewish Affairs prior to it being taken over by the infamous Adolph Eichmann. Clips from Eichmann's 1961 trial in Israel are shown along with transcripts from the trial indicating that Eichmann considered Mildenstein as an ""expert"" on Jewish affairs and that he was basically his mentor! Nonetheless, Mildenstein, apparently was not a racialist and privately had no problems socializing with Jewish people. The Tuchlers may not have been aware of Mildenstein's Nazi affiliations and were simply glad a non-Jewish German would strike up a friendship with them.After Mildenstein's replacement at the Office of Jewish Affairs in 1937, his movements in Germany up until the end of the war were largely unknown. Goldfinger flies to Germany and meets up with Mildenstein's daughter, Edda, who firmly believed that her father was no longer affiliated with the Nazis during the war. Goldfinger seeks out a retired journalist who wrote about Mildenstein during the 1960s when he had become an executive for Coca-Cola. Although the former SS officer was mentioned during the Eichmann trial, his reputation wasn't tarnished as it was believed (as the retired reporter pointed out), that his affiliation with the Nazis had ended in 1937, when he was replaced by Eichmann. During the war (as Mildenstein's daughter's husband indicates) Mildenstein was believed to be a mere 'journalist'.The plot thickens when Goldfinger finds Mildenstein's wartime file in records located in the former East Germany, which were not available to journalists back in the 60s. Goldfinger discovers that Mildenstein was actually promoted as an official in Goebbal's propaganda ministry and worked there for the rest of the war. Goldfinger confronts Mildenstein's daughter with the new information about her father and she appears reluctant to believe what Goldfinger is telling her. Even after she shows her a copy of her father's resume indicating his Nazi affiliations during the war, it is obvious that she's now quite uncomfortable dealing with these new revelations.As for Goldfinger's grandparents, he interviews an expert on German Jewish history who points out that the Tuchlers obviously were not aware of Mildenstein's Nazi wartime activities. They were also willing to forgive him for any past Nazi associations, due to their past friendship with him. Despite being Jewish, the Tuchlers never learned Hebrew while in Israel and continued to speak German. They continued to identify with German culture in spite of the Holocaust and that's why they visited Germany many times after the war.For the most part, 'The Flat' is riveting--only the ending proves to be slightly awkward. As Goldfinger and his mother walk through an old German Jewish cemetery in Germany, they search for the grave of his great-grandfather. Goldfinger unnecessarily berates his mother for not taking more of an interest in her parents when they were alive in order to find out more about their history. Apparently, his grandparents were as complicit as the mother in not revealing information about their time living in Germany and their association with Mildenstein. The mother concedes she should have taken more of an interest in the family history but when she was younger, we have to believe her that she simply had no interest at that time.'The Flat' brings to the fore more revelations regarding issues of guilt and responsibility of ordinary Germans vis-&agrave;-vis the Holocaust. By the same token, it chronicles conflicting feelings on the part of those German Jews who survived. 'The Flat' plays out like a detective mystery, with its talented creator cast in the role of high stakes super sleuth!",4,Israeli documentarian's fascinating investigation of his own German Jewish
