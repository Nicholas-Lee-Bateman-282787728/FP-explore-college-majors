1134514,AKHNTRZDH67XX,B00123GQLG,Cathy Young,"[8, 8]","The second season of the new BBC ""Robin Hood"" gets off to an uneven start.  The first three episodes feature overly cheesy adventure plots (including one in which the hero is slowly lowered into a snakepit and one in which the baddies are trying to build an invincible army by creating armor out of impenetrable metal), but the strong character and relationship development more than makes up for it -- specifically, the Robin Hood/Lady Marian/Guy of Gisborne triangle, the storyline of Allan turning a spy for Gisborne, and the tense dynamic between Guy and the Sheriff of Nottingham.From Episode 4 onward, however, the pace really picks up and the cheese factor drops dramatically (despite some lame moments here and there).  The Sheriff's plot against King Richard and Robin, Marian, and the gang's efforts to stop this plot take center stage, even as the character/relationship developments get ever more complicated and interesting.  Robin's almost fanatical zeal in the king's cause takes an often dark turn, Marian is devoted to his cause but finds herself stifled when she joins him in the woods, Allan is torn between opportunistic self-interest and attachment to his friends in the gang, and Guy's feelings for Marian bring out his long-suppressed humanity and cause him to question the Sheriff's actions.  Meanwhile, Marian's love and admiration for Robin coexists with increasingly complex attraction/repulsion feelings toward Guy as she begins to see a compassionate and even noble side to him.  The dynamic between Guy and Allan is fascinating to watch as the two seem to develop a genuine friendship.  The storyline involving Marian's father is also very touching.  Meanwhile, the Sheriff remains his deliciously evil self as he plays for ever-higher stakes.  The cast does a great job, particularly Richard Armitage as Guy, Keith Allen as the Sheriff, Lucy Griffiths as Marian, Joe Armstrong as Allan and Jonas Armstrong as Robin.  Some of the supporting cast is excellent as well, especially the actress who plays Matilda the accused witch in ""Ducking and Diving"" and the actor who plays Lord Winchester in ""For England.""Episodes 6 through 12 are truly awesome (my personal favorites are ""For England"" and ""Walkabout"").  The season finale is highly controversial because of ....*****SPOILER AHEAD...*******... Marian's death at Guy's hands.  I don't think it was a wise decision, and Marian's departure definitely harmed the show (though I think there is a lot to like in Season 3 as well), but at the same time, it is a very powerful if tragic conclusion to the S2 storyline.  (Too bad it's somewhat diluted by a ridiculously drawn-out death scene in which Marian is way too coherent for someone who's been stabbed in the stomach, and the sequences after her death drag on much too long as well.)All in all, a vastly enjoyable season.",5,Great television despite a few cheesy moments,1254182400,"09 29, 2009",2009,2852,"['second', 'season', 'new', 'BBC', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'off', 'uneven', 'start', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'feature', 'overly', 'cheesy', 'adventure', 'plots', 'including', 'one', 'hero', 'slowly', 'lowered', 'snakepit', 'one', 'baddies', 'are', 'trying', 'build', 'invincible', 'army', 'creating', 'armor', 'impenetrable', 'metal', 'strong', 'character', 'relationship', 'development', 'more', 'up', 'specifically', 'Robin', 'Hood/Lady', 'Marian/Guy', 'Gisborne', 'triangle', 'storyline', 'Allan', 'turning', 'spy', 'Gisborne', 'tense', 'dynamic', 'Guy', 'Sheriff', 'Nottingham.From', 'Episode', '4', 'onward', 'however', 'pace', 'really', 'up', 'cheese', 'factor', 'drops', 'dramatically', 'lame', 'moments', 'here', 'there', 'Sheriff', 'plot', 'King', 'Richard', 'Robin', 'Marian', 'gang', 'efforts', 'stop', 'plot', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'even', 'character/relationship', 'developments', 'get', 'ever', 'more', 'complicated', 'interesting', 'Robin', 'almost', 'fanatical', 'zeal', 'king', 'cause', 'often', 'dark', 'turn', 'Marian', 'devoted', 'cause', 'stifled', 'when', 'woods', 'Allan', 'torn', 'opportunistic', 'self-interest', 'attachment', 'friends', 'gang', 'Guy', 'feelings', 'Marian', 'bring', 'out', 'long-suppressed', 'humanity', 'cause', 'question', 'Sheriff', 'actions', 'Meanwhile', 'Marian', 'love', 'admiration', 'Robin', 'coexists', 'increasingly', 'complex', 'attraction/repulsion', 'feelings', 'Guy', 'see', 'compassionate', 'even', 'noble', 'side', 'dynamic', 'Guy', 'Allan', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'two', 'seem', 'develop', 'genuine', 'friendship', 'storyline', 'involving', 'Marian', 'father', 'also', 'very', 'touching', 'Meanwhile', 'Sheriff', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'self', 'ever-higher', 'stakes', 'cast', 'great', 'job', 'particularly', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'Guy', 'Keith', 'Allen', 'Sheriff', 'Lucy', 'Griffiths', 'Marian', 'Joe', 'Armstrong', 'Allan', 'Jonas', 'Armstrong', 'Robin', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'actress', 'who', 'Matilda', 'accused', 'witch', 'Ducking', 'Diving', 'actor', 'who', 'Lord', 'Winchester', 'England', 'Episodes', '6', '12', 'are', 'truly', 'awesome', 'personal', 'favorites', 'are', 'England', 'Walkabout', 'season', 'finale', 'highly', 'controversial', '.*****SPOILER', 'AHEAD', '*******', 'Marian', 'death', 'Guy', 'hands', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'wise', 'decision', 'Marian', 'departure', 'definitely', 'harmed', 'show', 'think', 'lot', 'like', 'Season', '3', 'as', 'well', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'powerful', 'tragic', 'conclusion', 'S2', 'storyline', 'bad', 'somewhat', 'diluted', 'ridiculously', 'drawn-out', 'death', 'scene', 'Marian', 'way', 'too', 'coherent', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'stabbed', 'stomach', 'sequences', 'death', 'drag', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'as', 'well', 'vastly', 'enjoyable', 'season']",Robin Hood: Season 2

This series is a refreshing point of view with some of the same themes.  Robin Hood is, of course, the dashing and daring hero who steals from the rich and gives to the poor.  His thwarting of the Sheriff's and Gisborn's efforts are also neatly done.  I especially like the character build ups including the personal interplays between them.  I can believe that Marion sees good in Gisborn regardless of his efforts to exhibit a mean streak and dark doings.  I found myself growing in empathy for Gisborn.  We all have that dark side of ourselves.  Some just show it more than others.  I was sad as I watched the death of an important figure and at who's hand the deed was done.  I wasn't sure if I liked this.  I am a romantic and wanted a very different outcome.  I was also used to the idea that the hero gets the girl.

My favorite rendition is Errol Flynn (""Adventures of Robin Hood"", 1938) but what Jonas Armstrong brings to the character shouldn't be missed.  Armstrong's facial expressions and delivery makes you love Robin even more.The actors who portray Hood's gang was well cast.  They play off each other beautifully.  I feel the group is more unified that I have ever seen before-I love it when they state together, ""WE ARE ROBIN HOOD"".  you realize that is is more than one person, it is an ideal.The storytelling is also well done.  It gives you more than Robin Hood and his band of thieves stealing from the rich (and giving to the poor).  From the beginning of season 1, you discover the history of Robin Hood, the Sheriff of Nottingham (brilliantly played by Keith Allen), the battle of the throne between Richard and John as well as how the gang was formed.I love every season-as I am now enjoying the 3rd and last on BBC America, my favorite is season 2.  So many people are critical of certain details (i.e. accuracy of costumes).  Personally, I think it is a beautiful telling of the legend in every way.  It is an enjoyable series-lighthearted and fun.I hate to say goodbye to Jonas Armstrong's Robin Hood after only three seasons.

Joe Armstrong as the two timing Allan a Dale, who becomes the sidekick to Sir Guy (or the sidekick of the sidekick) was particularly enjoyable for me in this season.Again, my biggest disappointment as a Catholic was, again, no decent clerical characters to balance out the 'bad' ones.  In one episode, 'Catholic' Robin even punches an evil cleric so that he falls down a flight of stairs.  ANY Catholic would know, evil or not, to hit a priest, with the priestly character on his soul, was tantamount to hitting Christ Himself and considered a mortal sin.  The only time one would be allowed to 'manhandle' a priest was if he was in the act of actually harming himself or someone else physically - and even in that case one is not allowed to use more force than necessary. (Allan a Dale even pushes over a nun in one episode to get her 'seal' to fool Guy that Marian is writing from the convent.) Again, the history revisionists at the BBC are having their fun at the expense of historical reality, but....what can one expect of the current anti Christian climate in the world?Other than THAT the show was entertaining, though still with it's anachronisms in dialogue and detail.

1134558,A3NTEO3ZAO1ZJW,B00123GQLG,poolsidedesigner,"[0, 0]","This legend is a great choice for episodic TV, as the historical characters provide many story arcs.  Given how Wall Street robber barons remind us that stealing from the rich to give to the poor could apply to our lives today, these light hearted scripts are involving.  The one thing that doesn't ring true is how frequently Robin & his gang engage in mortal combat with Guy of Gisborn or the Sheriff of Nottingham, yet no final death blow is struck on either side -- because that would have ended the series early.  Richard Armitage shines as the long haired villain Guy.  His sexy black leather ensemble (which stands out because he rides a white  horse) is more a star of the show than the top billed Keith Allen.  Jonas Armstrong portrays Robin of Locksley with convincing compassion and athleticism.  Lucy as Maid Marion is cute and sweet, but when she dons a disguise to fight with swords one must suspend belief.  (Her shorter height, curvy figure, and lady's boots would have given her away.)  The character of Much adds humor to provide relief from frequent scenes of fear and violence -- such as children being scheduled to be hung for stealing a loaf of bread -- but we already know that Robin will always save them in time.  In terms of historical accuracy, Maid Marion sought sanctuary in a convent after Robin eventually died, but the writers here chose a different path to end this series.  While that enables greater depth of character and nuance to be brought to Gisborn's role in series 3 -- and RA's acting chops really come to the fore in series 3 -- I was so misled by the comedic tone of this series that I was not prepared for a sudden, brutal end to Maid Marion.  (I literally had to take some weeks off before viewing any more episodes.)  In terms of psychology, if Gisborn had loved Marion as deeply as the scripts claim he did, he would have fled from his dishonorable job to France, rescuing Marion by taking her with him.  Robin would have followed, and then both men would have likely fought to the death, leaving Marion at least alive.  Instead, we are left to assume that Gisborn's twisted character results from a deeply damaging childhood, since he weakly follows the murderous orders of a sociopathic Sheriff rather than think for himself.",4,Fine Ensemble Cast,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",2013,2276,"['legend', 'great', 'choice', 'episodic', 'TV', 'historical', 'characters', 'provide', 'many', 'story', 'arcs', 'Given', 'how', 'Wall', 'Street', 'robber', 'barons', 'remind', 'stealing', 'rich', 'give', 'poor', 'could', 'apply', 'lives', 'today', 'light', 'hearted', 'scripts', 'are', 'involving', 'one', 'thing', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'how', 'frequently', 'Robin', 'gang', 'engage', 'mortal', 'combat', 'Guy', 'Gisborn', 'Sheriff', 'Nottingham', 'yet', 'final', 'death', 'blow', 'struck', 'side', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'series', 'early', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'shines', 'long', 'haired', 'villain', 'Guy', 'sexy', 'black', 'leather', 'ensemble', 'out', 'white', 'horse', 'more', 'star', 'show', 'top', 'billed', 'Keith', 'Allen', 'Jonas', 'Armstrong', 'Robin', 'Locksley', 'convincing', 'compassion', 'athleticism', 'Lucy', 'Maid', 'Marion', 'cute', 'sweet', 'when', 'disguise', 'fight', 'swords', 'one', 'must', 'suspend', 'belief', 'shorter', 'height', 'curvy', 'figure', 'lady', 'boots', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'away', 'character', 'Much', 'humor', 'provide', 'relief', 'frequent', 'scenes', 'fear', 'violence', 'such', 'children', 'being', 'scheduled', 'be', 'hung', 'stealing', 'loaf', 'bread', 'already', 'know', 'Robin', 'will', 'always', 'save', 'time', 'terms', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'Maid', 'Marion', 'sought', 'sanctuary', 'convent', 'Robin', 'eventually', 'died', 'writers', 'here', 'chose', 'different', 'path', 'end', 'series', 'greater', 'depth', 'character', 'nuance', 'be', 'brought', 'Gisborn', 'role', 'series', '3', 'RA', 'acting', 'chops', 'really', 'come', 'fore', 'series', '3', 'was', 'so', 'misled', 'comedic', 'tone', 'series', 'was', 'not', 'prepared', 'sudden', 'brutal', 'end', 'Maid', 'Marion', 'literally', 'had', 'take', 'weeks', 'off', 'viewing', 'more', 'episodes', 'terms', 'psychology', 'Gisborn', 'had', 'loved', 'Marion', 'as', 'deeply', 'scripts', 'claim', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'fled', 'dishonorable', 'job', 'France', 'rescuing', 'Marion', 'taking', 'Robin', 'would', 'have', 'followed', 'then', 'men', 'would', 'have', 'likely', 'fought', 'death', 'leaving', 'Marion', 'least', 'alive', 'Instead', 'are', 'left', 'assume', 'Gisborn', 'twisted', 'character', 'results', 'deeply', 'damaging', 'childhood', 'murderous', 'orders', 'sociopathic', 'Sheriff', 'rather', 'think']",Robin Hood: Season 2

From the it 's very first episode this fast paced action adventure series continues to please.  As long as one is able to suspend a lot of logic this series tends to work.  The fun character of this series is without doubt the role of the Sheriff. The sheriff has most of the best lines and just when you think he could get no lower he always does.  Living well in Nothingham castle also known as Castle Sieve as Robin and his men seem to be able to enter and leave this fortress pretty much at ease, the sheriff is surrounded by a seemingly endless horde of flunky guards, one may wonder where they all keep coming from.

1134560,A2VODABWSVHV8E,B00123GQLG,"Ray ""A Reader""","[0, 0]","If you didn't think that one more Robin Hood incarnation could possible hold its own against the long series of productions over the past decades, here's the proof that it indeed can--and HAS--been done. This remake of the Robin Hood epic, made by the BBC and filmed in 2006, as a superb new look at the story and the characters, and is completely remade for a 21st century audience. The story is the same, with (for the most part) all the same characters, and the motives of the merry band of men remains unchanged: the Sheriff of Nottingham, along with his henchman, Guy of Gisborne, have illicitly taken over Nottingham (the rightful manor of Locksley himself) and Robin and his men are taking from the Sheriff to feed the poor and the needy while they wait for the return of the King so that things can be made right.You would think that in this age of Avatar that there would be almost no way such a show could be of interest, and yet this wonderful series from the BBC shows that it can indeed be so, and Robin Hood here can hold the attention and interest in parents and children alike. It's updated, to be sure, and, yes, it contains numerous anachronisms, but that isn't the point at all: this is the classic Robin Hood story told all over again for today's audience in a dramatic, exciting, and fun-loving way. The show follows the classic Robin Hood story in Season One (the show runs a total of three seasons, and takes a slight turn in the standard story in Season Two, and takes an even bigger turn in Season Three), and if you know the story, you'll enjoy seeing how this show tells it in their own way. But nearly any child watching will be able to pick up the story quite well, with clear villains, heroes, and motives. It's fun, dramatic, and exciting.The show is lushly filmed. Using a full-scale, outside set that was built in Hungary (you would swear this was in the middle of England, near to the true Sherwood Forest), the scenes are acted out on a grand scale that makes us completely unaware that this is a dramatic production. Colors are lush and intense. The costumes worn, though replete with anachronistic styles (some of Marian's outfits appear as though they just came off the rack at J. Crew), are gorgeous and fun to look at it, and really, that's the point: you should just sit back and enjoy this for what it is. It isn't a historical examination of the mid-twelth century English setting: it's the story of Robin Hood, told for a modern audience. The filming is so lush that the closest thing I can think of to which to compare it is the BBC's MI-5, which is a modern-day police drama that also uses the intense colors and slick production values to a similar effect. It's gorgeous, and its such a shame that, to date (December 2012) only the First Season is available on Blu-Ray.Some standout performances exist, although nearly all the cast is excellent. The evil Sheriff (Keith Allen) is both menacing and funny, his sidekick, Guy (Richard Armitage) is a double-minded, tragic figure, Robin Hood himself (Jonas Armstrong) is the hero's hero, Little John (Gordon Kennedy) is the group's moral compass,  and Much (Sam Troughton) is both hilarious and heart-tugging. Season Two continues the classic story of Robin Hood established in Season One, but ups the ante with increased dramatic scenarios, and some new cast additions.This show is fun, entertaining, and often, thought-provoking. It pulls on your emotions. It draws you in. Kids can enjoy it as well as adults.

Here's how it should have ended: Guy doesn't kill Marian,  Marian and Robin get married, they defeat the Sheriff,  they have a baby and everyone lives happily ever after.Even with the disappointing ending, the show is still worth watching.",4,Great series despite a disappointing ending,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,834,"['started', 'watching', 'series', 'seeing', 'Lucy', 'Griffith', 'who', 'Marian', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'True', 'Blood', 'was', 'wonderful', 'discovery', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'series', 'little', 'dark', 'times', 'lightens', 'things', 'up', 'humerous', 'scenes', 'interplay', 'characters', 'especially', 'love', 'triangle', 'Marian', 'Guy', 'Robin', 'what', 'kept', 'watching', 'eagerly', 'anticipating', 'next', 'DVD', 'Netflix.SPOILERS***My', 'main', 'objection', 'Marian', 'should', 'NOT', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'end', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'are', 'true', 'love', 'fact', 'killed', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Season', '3', 'Here', 'how', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'Guy', ""n't"", 'kill', 'Marian', 'Marian', 'Robin', 'get', 'married', 'defeat', 'Sheriff', 'have', 'baby', 'everyone', 'lives', 'happily', 'ever', 'after.Even', 'disappointing', 'ending', 'show', 'still', 'worth', 'watching']",Robin Hood: Season 2
1134572,A17K8XNE6EVFLI,B00123GQLG,"Tamara Andre ""tamarandra""","[4, 5]","The second season of Robin Hood BBC was a bit of a downer for me.  Season One was electric.  Due to the brilliance of the cast, particularly Jonas Armstrong as Robin Hood, Lucy Griffiths as Maid Marian, and Richard Armitage as Sir Guy of Gisbourne.  But everyone was great.  I have to say this was possibly the most gifted ensemble cast ever to grace a television series of any genre.  This retelling of Robin Hood had the possibility to actually overshadow my previous favorite version, the 1984 Robin of Sherwood.  ROS had everything but there were a few mis-steps,at times the talented actors, Michael Praed as Robin, Judi Trott as Maid Marian, Clive Mantle as Little John, Ray Winstone as Will Scarlett, etc, could give a bad reading of a line if left to their own devices.  But at other times ROS ascended to the level of great art.The actors of Robin Hood BBC rarely if ever misread a line.  They were supreme.  But unforunately the writers lost their vision midway through Season Two and totally went mad in the final episode, S2, E13.  They in effect undid every positive thing in the series for me and S3 is just a mess.  I would give S1 a 10, S2 a 9, and S3 and 2.  It just wasn't believable or interesting for me.  For Sir Guy of Gisbourne fans, perhaps, S3 was better, because basically the writers ignored Robin Hood and made S3 the ""Sir Guy of Gisbourne Show"".  But back to Season 2.  There is still enough left of the original conceit, Robin Hood for our generation, that Series 2 is still great.  But it is a shame that the writers let everything fall apart in their zeal to do something different with the Sir Guy character.This is why, despite my feelings that Season One and Season Two had the possbility of finally creating a Robin Hood that was the DEFINITIVE Robin Hood, (mostly because of Jonas Armstrong's brilliant portrayal of Robin Hood) they failed.  Robin Of Sherwood is still champ.  I think everyone should see this BBC version, because of the incredible chemistry between Robin Hood and Maid Marian... and also yet the chemistry between Maid Marian and Sir Guy..  But if you want to see the DEFINITIVE ROBIN HOOD..  buy the 1984 version, Robin Of Sherwood, starring the delicious Michael Praed in the first two seasons, and Jason Connery in the third season as Robin Hood.",4,coulda shoulda,1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,2304,"['second', 'season', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'BBC', 'was', 'bit', 'downer', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'electric', 'Due', 'brilliance', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Jonas', 'Armstrong', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Lucy', 'Griffiths', 'Maid', 'Marian', 'Richard', 'Armitage', 'Sir', 'Guy', 'Gisbourne', 'everyone', 'was', 'great', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'possibly', 'most', 'gifted', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'ever', 'grace', 'television', 'series', 'genre', 'retelling', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'had', 'possibility', 'actually', 'overshadow', 'previous', 'favorite', 'version', '1984', 'Robin', 'Sherwood', 'ROS', 'had', 'everything', 'were', 'few', 'mis-steps', 'times', 'talented', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Praed', 'Robin', 'Judi', 'Trott', 'Maid', 'Marian', 'Clive', 'Mantle', 'Little', 'John', 'Ray', 'Winstone', 'Will', 'Scarlett', 'etc', 'could', 'give', 'bad', 'reading', 'line', 'left', 'own', 'devices', 'other', 'times', 'ROS', 'ascended', 'level', 'great', 'art.The', 'actors', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'BBC', 'rarely', 'ever', 'misread', 'line', 'were', 'supreme', 'unforunately', 'writers', 'lost', 'vision', 'midway', 'Season', 'Two', 'totally', 'went', 'mad', 'final', 'episode', 'S2', 'E13', 'effect', 'undid', 'positive', 'thing', 'series', 'S3', 'just', 'mess', 'would', 'give', 'S1', '10', 'S2', '9', 'S3', '2', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'believable', 'interesting', 'Sir', 'Guy', 'Gisbourne', 'fans', 'perhaps', 'S3', 'was', 'better', 'basically', 'writers', 'ignored', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'made', 'S3', 'Sir', 'Guy', 'Gisbourne', 'Show', 'back', 'Season', '2', 'still', 'enough', 'left', 'original', 'conceit', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'generation', 'Series', '2', 'still', 'great', 'shame', 'writers', 'let', 'everything', 'fall', 'apart', 'zeal', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'Sir', 'Guy', 'character.This', 'why', 'feelings', 'Season', 'One', 'Season', 'Two', 'had', 'possbility', 'finally', 'creating', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'was', 'DEFINITIVE', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'mostly', 'Jonas', 'Armstrong', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'failed', 'Robin', 'Sherwood', 'still', 'champ', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'BBC', 'version', 'incredible', 'chemistry', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Maid', 'Marian', 'also', 'yet', 'chemistry', 'Maid', 'Marian', 'Sir', 'Guy..', 'want', 'see', 'DEFINITIVE', 'ROBIN', 'HOOD..', 'buy', '1984', 'version', 'Robin', 'Sherwood', 'starring', 'delicious', 'Michael', 'Praed', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'third', 'season', 'Robin', 'Hood']",Robin Hood: Season 2

It is evident even from the first episode that the overall tone of the show is much darker this time around, as each our heroes must contend not only with the Sheriff's evildoings, but also with their own personal tragedies.  This darker tone goes hand-in-hand with a bit more violence, though it is no more graphic than what was presented in the first season.  This gives the show an intensity that had been missing before, and the opportunity to present some jaw-dropping action sequences (Robin vs the Black Knights is not to be missed!).It was always the characters that made the show appealing to me, and on that score S2 delivers in spades.  There are many lovely Robin/Marian moments, and some surprising new alliances (of friends and enemies) are formed as well.  One of my favorite scenes of the entire series is a beautifully-written character exposition sequence in the episode ""A Good Day To Die"" where, in the classic death-at-sunrise scenario, each member of the gang spends their potentially last-night-on-earth revealing their inner secrets.  It's an extremely emotional scene, and a powerful one, that brings up insecurities and issues that have been building since the very beginning of the series.Of course, the series wouldn't be Robin Hood if there wasn't also plenty of fun to be had along the way.  The Sheriff is still as hilarious as he is evil, and it's a blast watching Robin and Co. get the best of him time and again.  Keith Allen does an especially great job with the Sherrif's gloating/crying in ""Get Carter"", an episode which also introduces one of the most enjoyable recurring characters to come to Nottingham in quite awhile.Season 2 has more of a cohesive story arc than season one, and as such, there are plot twists galore (most notably the 2-part finale) that impact future episodes and draw on events of those past. I'd recommend staying spoiler-free until you've seen them. That being said, get a box of tissues handy and be prepared to pick your jaw up off the floor by the time you finish the last episode. It's a doozy.Rumor has it, there will be a S3, although the BBC is a being a bit cagey as to the details.
