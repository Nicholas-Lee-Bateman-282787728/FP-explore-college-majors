Absolutely love Jason Robards and Julie Harris...and in this they were their usual extreme high quality. But...as an extreme lover of Christmas movies, this one fell so short. But....(there are a lot of ""buts"" in my review...sorry). Some other reviewer commented something to the effect that it was like a 2 person play and I concur....getting past the lack of ""Christmasy"" was hard for me, But(here's another but)once I did, it was a rather nifty touching story. Front Row Features produced it, and the jacket label was a bit wrong about the story line...not uncommon. And the only real criticism I have of the movie, besides not what I consider a Christmas movie is that the music sound track was absolutely creepy!!!! Really. Not really sure when it was filmed, late 80s, early 90s? Robards died in the late 90s I think, so it obviously had to have been before then. Filmography was typical of that time frame, but again, music was really, really, really creepy. The overall quality of the film would have been so much more enhanced without the music. Nice enough movie, G rated, no foul language....just because you have a Christmas tree and/or it's set at Christmas time does not make it Christmasy....I think I will look up the  story/book it is based on and read that.",3,"not a ""Christmas"" movie, but.......",1370995200,"06 12, 2013",2013,1318,"['Wow', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'where', 'start', 'Absolutely', 'Jason', 'Robards', 'Julie', 'Harris', 'were', 'usual', 'extreme', 'high', 'quality', 'extreme', 'lover', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'one', 'fell', 'so', 'short', 'are', 'lot', 'buts', 'review', 'sorry', 'other', 'reviewer', 'commented', 'something', 'effect', 'was', '2', 'person', 'play', 'concur', '.getting', 'lack', 'Christmasy', 'was', 'hard', 'here', 'once', 'did', 'was', 'rather', 'nifty', 'touching', 'story', 'Front', 'Row', 'Features', 'produced', 'jacket', 'label', 'was', 'bit', 'wrong', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'uncommon', 'only', 'real', 'criticism', 'have', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'consider', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'music', 'sound', 'track', 'was', 'absolutely', 'creepy', 'Really', 'Not', 'really', 'sure', 'when', 'was', 'filmed', 'late', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'Robards', 'died', 'late', '90s', 'think', 'obviously', 'had', 'have', 'been', 'then', 'Filmography', 'was', 'typical', 'time', 'frame', 'again', 'music', 'was', 'really', 'really', 'really', 'creepy', 'overall', 'quality', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'enhanced', 'music', 'Nice', 'enough', 'movie', 'G', 'rated', 'foul', 'language', '.just', 'have', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'and/or', 'set', 'Christmas', 'time', 'not', 'make', 'Christmasy', '.I', 'think', 'will', 'look', 'up', 'story/book', 'based', 'read']",N/A

I had seen this movie on the market for years and had been curious about it but hadn't watched it. I just recently bought this edition on DVD in a second-hand store. It wasn't at all what I expected, but it wasn't necessarily a disappointment. I think if I had been watching it at Christmas time it might have been a downer, because during the holiday I like ""feel-good"" movies. Though this may not qualify for that catagory, or the typical ""happily-ever-after"" scenario, to me it didn't end on a bad note. There was hope and a positive direction in the man's life.*Spoiler Alert*I did, however, ache for the character played by Julie Harris as she returned to a life that obviously didn't hold the happiness she might have found with Robard's character. I think she played her part so well and it left a haunting sadness when she returned home.It is true that there is no great action or any laugh-out-loud moments in this film, but there are moments of warmth and awareness and a sensitivity to feelings that makes it worthwhile.

The story is about a widower named John Tanner (Jason Robards) who uses an escort service to find a Christmas companion with the stipulation that the woman must be about his age, and they sleep in different bedrooms, at a service fee of $500. The service provider (Don Francks), since his assistant is gone for the holidays, and he doesn't have access to the file, promises to provide him with a list of names to choose from. When John Tanner is called by the agency to meet the service provider at a hotel guest area, Tanner is reluctant but agrees, and then he learns that the woman named Iris (Julie Harris) wanted to see him incognito from a distance before she wants to go with him. Eventually the two meet and set a date and time to be picked up at a local bus stop and then drive to the secluded family cabin next to a lake.Iris is beautiful, about the same age as John Tanner, nervous, quiet, and mysterious. She appears to be a reluctant participant in his company and refuses to answer any questions, which deepens the mystery. The Christmas eve is somewhat uneasy for both of them but the Christmas day gets better than expected. When John is getting to enjoy the company, she announces that the date is finished and would like to go home and she doesn't want to visit him again. It is at the end the viewers come to know that she is in fact married to the service provider and the idea behind this farce was to earn the badly needed service fee of $500 to pay their family bills.  Both Julie Harris and Jason Robards offer brilliant performances as the two ""older couples"" trying to spend Christmas together. This movie is reminiscent, to a certain extent, of another great classic ""On Golden Pond.""
