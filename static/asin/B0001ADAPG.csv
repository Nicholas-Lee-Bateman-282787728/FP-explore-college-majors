I realize that some kids might find the dragon scary- it actually scares me, haha.  Overall, this how a childrens story SHOULD be told- it's cute, adorable, funny and even suspenseful in a few spots (but not *too* suspenseful as to distract and make your kids cry).  Not picking up an adorable story like this for your kids is an absolute crime.  Do so today!  Oh, and if there's more to this adorable and loveable puppy, pick up those stories too.

Yes, there is that scary dragon one, which my son gets scared of, too. However, my son really relates to Kipper and his friends. He reenacts the scenarios in his spare time and even the scary stories seem to help him deal with his own fears. He will pretend, kind of relive the story in such a way that I think he is processing his fear and how to respond to it. Kipper is the best there is. No other video character comes close. We love the books, too.",5,always a hit,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,562,"['can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'Kipper', 'son', 'loved', 'was', 'one', 'still', '3', 'half', 'year', 'old', 'Yes', 'scary', 'dragon', 'one', 'son', 'scared', 'too', 'However', 'son', 'really', 'Kipper', 'friends', 'scenarios', 'spare', 'time', 'even', 'scary', 'stories', 'seem', 'help', 'deal', 'own', 'fears', 'will', 'pretend', 'kind', 'relive', 'story', 'such', 'way', 'think', 'processing', 'fear', 'how', 'respond', 'Kipper', 'best', 'other', 'video', 'character', 'close', 'love', 'books', 'too']",N/A
