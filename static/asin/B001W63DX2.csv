1244242,A1BMQA5PIZKU1P,B001W63DX2,"Bryan ""Dragonboots""","[18, 18]","I have to say this band really knows how to put out quality DVDs for us fans.  'The Early Years' and 'Live After Death/The Early Years Pt. 2' are one of the best DVDs by a rock band ever released - even Kiss(another huge favorite of mine).  Both DVDs have a ton of concert and documentary footage on 2 discs each as well as pictures, easter eggs, rare footage, etc.  It's virtually impossible for any Maiden fan to be dissapointed.  Although I would have to say getting through all the english accents is a challenge to my American ears.  Thank God for closed-caption.Now comes Flight 666.  It is very high quality just like their previous DVDs.  The thing that struck me the most after watching it was how much fun they have on tour and how much they love what they are doing and thats a fun thing to watch.  Nicko McBrain is funny and good natured(as I'm sure Maiden fans already know) and is never seen in a bad mood or even a little tired anywhere on this documentary.  The crew seem to enjoy what they do and flash hand signals and sign language to each other from across the stage in accordance to the lyrics of whatever song Bruce is singing while on stage.  Its fun to see the band ham it up while on the plane going to a show('so much for sleeping' manager Rod Smallwood says), seeing the extreme hysteria of fans in every country(think BEATLEMANIA x10 is the best way I can describe it.  Even the band is a little freaked at times and laughing over it).  One fan is shown in tears and crossing his chest and looking to the sky thanking God that he is at a Maiden show and holding one of Nicko's drumsticks(it's a fairly long moment so we the viewer can realise his reaction) or signing hundreds and hundreds of photos while on the plane(and pushing each picture off the seat tray and seeing hundreds of the pictures in one big messy pile on the floor and Steve's son George collecting them or talking to Steve Harris' 4 kids or seeing what the band do on their days off(Nicko & Dave play golf, Adrian comically gets smacked in the forehead and gets his hat knocked off by a pro-tennis players fast serve causing the camera man to say 'thats in the movie!', etc).  The concert segments are really good.  Again, the band look like they are having the best time of their lives - not an easy thing to do I would think after nearly 30 years.  I was surprised they didn't do 'Flight of Icarus' or 'Where Eagles Dare', 2 standout songs from the era of songs they are performing.The packaging is great.  Its the size of regular DVD case except that it is more like a hardback book with pages of a diary Bruce did for a rock magazine as well as pictures.  The very back of the book-like package has the 2 DVDs one halfway over the other to save room but very safe from scratching.Great band.  Great DVD.  If you like their past DVDs then this one is a no brainer.  They are really good to their fans when it comes to home videos/dvds.

Seeing the artwork on that first album (does anyone remember LP's?) and seeing them live pretty much convinced me that I would probably be an Iron Maiden fan for life!  They were that good, and that original as the British invasion of metal spanned the globe (Saxon, Def Leppard, Judas Priest, Maiden, etc.).  To see them come this far, and be so widely loved and acclaimed worldwide is great.  This DVD captures the essence and passion of their worldwide fan base, and shows how much of a 'renaissance man' Bruce truly is, given his many talents and varied interests.  Of course, seeing a documentary (rockumentary) of Bruce pilot a Boeing 757 carrying his bandmates, crew, and equipment is awesome.  There are many comical and lighthearted moments in this DVD as we observe Bruce and company handle the logistics of a major world tour.  The other DVD consists of full songs (one song each) culled from each city of their world tour.  The performances are passionate and tight, and the video and audio quality second to none.  These guys are probably old enough to be grandparents, yet they still command the stage as if they were in their 20's!  Get this double-DVD set.

I used to like Van Halen but they can't get it together like this. Also, this is the first time a rock/metal band has had their very own jet to travel in. Sure, some bands have used private planes in the past but nothing on this grand of a scale.This is a great addition to your Iron Maiden DVD library.You get the documentary of just what it take to create a plane to carry tons of music equipment and props and still have room for the band and the entire crew. It takes a lot of people working together to keep a band like Maiden up and running.What really impressed me about watching this was the fan reaction was the same regardless of the country. You see screaming Japanese fans, fans in Alaska, LA, and Brazil, and the focus is on the energy that Maiden creates night and night at every gig. Not many bands can captured an audience like that over and over again. Some bands may get it right for one show and then have a few bad shows later on, but not Iron Maiden because of their focus and desire to make sure the fans have a good time at all costs.The first DVD contains the film and the second contains 16-songs from the first Iron Maiden album to Fear of the Dark. The 2nd DVD shows you concert highlights from all the countries on the tour minus the flight times and jet lag. The jet lag had to be severe and its amazing to see the band members put out that much energy every night.If you an Iron Maiden fan or into Metal, then watch Flight 666 and see a band in top form.

Then they arrive at the hotel at which point the band and crew leave both fans and documentary crew behind til show time. After show time, they go back on Ed Force One and guess what? They do the same thing again. About the only variant from this routine is on their day off.

Many of those in the crowds were teens & college age and they're chanting for a band where the youngest member (Dickinson) is 51-years-old and is playing songs that were written before many of these fans were born.This was their Back In Time tour so they only played their old 1980s work, which I guess would attract a younger fan base since people like me would prefer to hear newer songs in addition to stuff I first heard in the mid-1980s.",4,Interesting look behind the scenes,1253059200,"09 16, 2009",2009,1007,"['was', 'interesting', 'see', 'making', 'marathon', '45-day', 'tour', ""'d"", 'also', 'bet', 'Bruce', 'just', 'only', 'lead', 'singer', 'who', 'can', 'also', 'pilot', 'jumbo', 'jet.I', 'rented', 'DVD', 'worth', 'one', 'viewing', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'want', 'buy', 'keep', ""'m"", 'saying', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'huge', 'Maiden', 'fan', 'last', '23', 'years', 'also', 'fan', 'Dickinson', 'solo', 'work.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'relatively', 'limited', 'concert', 'performance', 'can', 'find', 'other', 'DVDs.It', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'old', 'guys', 'introducing', 'music', 'new', 'generation', 'Many', 'crowds', 'were', 'teens', 'college', 'age', ""'re"", 'chanting', 'band', 'where', 'youngest', 'member', 'Dickinson', '51-years-old', 'playing', 'songs', 'were', 'written', 'before', 'many', 'fans', 'were', 'born.This', 'was', 'Back', 'Time', 'tour', 'so', 'only', 'played', 'old', '1980s', 'work', 'guess', 'would', 'attract', 'younger', 'fan', 'base', 'people', 'would', 'prefer', 'hear', 'newer', 'songs', 'addition', 'stuff', 'first', 'heard', 'mid-1980s']",Iron Maiden: Flight 666

1244264,A1TW8ENID78WK6,B001W63DX2,PIECEMAKER,"[21, 43]","Well, I am a huge Iron Maiden fan (my #1 band) and have all their CD's & DVD's. I've seen Maiden every time they've been to Pittsburgh since the mid 90's: 1996 with Blaze/club show, the 2000 Dickinson return- he rightfully so went off on an ""elderly"" bottle thrower!, 2003 promoting the DVD music videos set, and last at 2005 Ozzfest (Bruce was knocking the time slot/sound issues/reality TV stars and this was before ""eggfest"").Now onto the film- I saw this at a limited showing ""Maiden day"" screening at a full theater (was surprised) in Pittsburgh PA on a Tuesday night. Sound & picture quality were amazing.To those that were hoping that this might be slowed down in the concert editing, so that you can actually watch an instrument being played- I'm sad to inform that once again edits are fast paced.It is a fun movie with a lot of 2008 live concert footage of their classic 80's songs. They go into some detail about the plane piloted by singer Bruce Dickinson (interviewed) and basically the film follows its journey around the world for 2 months.Most footage and time is spent in South America- this is where Maiden is the most popular nowadays. There are a few funny outrageous fan moments and the chaos in South America from a Maiden show is intense.There are many quick scenes with Nicko- he plays the joker part well the entire flick, a few brief interviews withSteve, Adrain and Janick. Hardly anything of Dave Murray and nothing serious at all with Nicko. There are brief cameos/comments by Kerry, Lars and a few other ""rock stars"". The problem I had was that this was being billed as the 1st time Maiden was letting us into their lives and there was nothing new in this department. I didn't learn or see anything new about where they live, their houses (mansions ?), everday life away from the band, marriages, wives (no mention at all), kids (very brief shot of Steves kids only), hobbies, side bands/projects, plus so much more would have been interesting. Does Bruce still fence ? is his side band still going ? Any wives/kids go on tour besides Steve's ? Did Steve ever re-marry ? Does anybody keep in touch with past members (Blaze, Paul, Clive)regularly ? Is Eddie just a giant robot now ? - there was a brief shot of a guy remote controlling him. Whats the situation with famous cover artist Derek Riggs nowadays- last I heard he was suing the band.Whats the deal with all the Maiden merchandizing out there now ? - how do members feel ?Is there really going to be only 1 more studio album ? - long rumored !Something thats been bothering me is that I've noticed multiple times nowin print/interviews and in person (see above/concerts) that Bruce clearly has some issues with older fans and American/United States fans.At the end of the movie in Canada he bashes US fans for not acceptingMaiden as early as Canadians fans did. I'm 32 and got into Maiden in their ""uncool"" (at least in US) early 90's days. It would have been great to see some serious questions & answers to topics like these.I already knew that they play some golf between shows - it was on the Rock In Rio 2000 DVD. The songs are great- but are edited and we will get them in full on the extended DVD/CD/Blu-ray sets that are coming. This will be a cool intro for non/new fans to watch - but leaves longtime fans still in the dark on many areas. Basically to us long time fans this will be a movie to show non-fan friends for a few laughs. Then watch/listen the full concert set which I'm sure will be great. Its way better than the whiney/depressing/bore fest that was Metallica's some kind of monster.Basically a concert video with some Pantera style funny moments thrown in, I was expecting more from Maiden since they already have tons of concert videos. Also was expecting more since the filmmakers previous ""Metal: headbangers journey"" documentary was very in-depth & excellent.PS: I realize that many of you will respond claiming I'm not a real fan or whatever and answer with basically made-up or internet rumour/unofficial fan site responses, please don't waste your time- I too can sumarize up some answers for my questions, but it would have been nice to have more official answers directly from the band.",3,For the new/non fans.,1240704000,"04 26, 2009",2009,4207,"['Well', 'am', 'huge', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'fan', '1', 'band', 'have', 'CD',

1244269,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B001W63DX2,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[1, 1]","Flight 666 The Film follows the band during their Somewhere Back In Time tour in the 23 concerts the band were plaing. Being a huge fan of Iron Maiden, when Flight 666 came out this June along with soundtrack of the film(the live songs on disc 2)I had to buy it. This film was said to be showing the band's life on tour and everyone who knows the band know that they are private to a certain point about their lives. Here they are showing the fans what it's like to be in the band or working for the band. And I haven't been disappointed, I've been surprised on how complete it was as it goes into details and there are interesting stories from the countries they played during the tour.You have to understand first that Iron Maiden is not your average band. No other band has a lead singer who also pilots the band's own private plane during a tour across five continents. They are also respected everywhere they go and they have influenced many bands of today.You have to admire them for staying down to earth people even with their success and for the fact that they have many great songs and albums. They are entertaining onstage and fans will find out just like I did that they are as much offstage. Capturing the intensity of band on tour is not an easy task but Sam Dunn's team (for those who don't know him, he made the Metal - A Headbanger's Journey and Global Metal documentaries which I would recommend watching if you are a fan of rock n' roll music or heavy metal or whatever YOU want to call it) just did that, I'm glad they were the ones who did this documentary as someone else might have screwed up. Oh and this is not about Dunn it's about the band.The purpose of the Somewhere Back In Time tour was to offer their increasingly younger fan base those classics song they might not have seen the band perform before. This means for the band going back to the classics, for this tour they performed songs like ""Rime Of The Ancient Mariner""(Bruce Dickinson said it was his favorite song to perform during the tour) and ""Can I Play With Madness"". They always played their old stuff but this goes further into the songs they didn't play, of course the tour still featured songs they always play like ""Number Of The Beast"" and ""Fear of The Dark"". The stage set was even reminiscent of the one used during the Powerslave tour mixed with a little of Somewhere In Time, it looks very good. The live footage shown in this film will likely blow you away, the band sounds amazing.It also shows people talking about Iron Maiden and their stories are interesting to hear. For instance the Priest who has many tattoos of the band and claims to be their biggest fan. Or someone saying just how much an Iron Maiden concert means to them, for how long they've been waiting etc. It may sound boring here but it certainly isn't. You see the road crew, how they build the stage, the fans nearly making a riot at a hotel where the band stays. It seems everyone was having fun during this tour, everyone smiles and tells jokes, fools around or something, you see that the band enjoy each others company and they still like selling out their concerts all over the world.Iron Maiden has always been exciting to watch and this DVD is another reason why. You also get another disc of the 17 live songs used on the Flight 666 soundtrack; the songs have been picked from different cities so each song is different from another and makes a show altogether. The film shows a good part of this disc already but if you only want to watch the live part it's nice to have. I have it and I've watched it already a good dozen times and each time I find it as good as before. Live After Death is the best Maiden concert DVD but Flight 666 is a great look at the band and is just as good. If you're a fan this a must never before has Maiden been shown this way, it's hard to believe just how good it is. It's hard to describe but if you are a fan of the band you just have to see this.There two versions the special edition has a better booklet, I own the standard edition as it was what was available to me.",5,"Wonderful inside look on the ""Somewhere Back In Time"" tour",1255305600,"10 12, 2009",2009,4086,"['Flight', '666', 'Film', 'band', 'Somewhere', 'Back', 'Time', 'tour', '23', 'concerts', 'band', 'were', 'plaing', 'Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'when', 'Flight', '666', 'came', 'out', 'June', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'live', 'songs', 'disc', '2', 'had', 'buy', 'film', 'was', 'said', 'be', 'showing', 'band', 'life', 'tour', 'everyone', 'who', 'band', 'know', 'are', 'private', 'certain', 'point', 'lives', 'Here', 'are', 'showing', 'fans', 'what', 'be', 'band', 'working', 'band', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'disappointed', ""'ve"", 'been', 'surprised', 'how', 'complete', 'was', 'details', 'are', 'interesting', 'stories', 'countries', 'played', 'tour.You', 'have', 'understand', 'first', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'not', 'average', 'band', 'other', 'band', 'lead', 'singer', 'who', 'also', 'pilots', 'band', 'own', 'private', 'plane', 'tour', 'five', 'continents', 'are', 'also', 'respected', 'everywhere', 'go', 'have', 'influenced', 'many', 'bands', 'today.You', 'have', 'admire', 'staying', 'down', 'earth', 'people', 'even', 'success', 'fact', 'have', 'many', 'great', 'songs', 'albums', 'are', 'entertaining', 'onstage', 'fans', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'did', 'are', 'as', 'much', 'offstage', 'Capturing', 'intensity', 'band', 'tour', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'Sam', 'Dunn', 'team', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'made', 'Metal', 'Headbanger', 'Journey', 'Global', 'Metal', 'documentaries', 'would', 'recommend', 'watching', 'are', 'fan', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'music', 'heavy', 'metal', 'YOU', 'want', 'call', 'just', 'did', ""'m"", 'glad', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'did', 'documentary', 'someone', 'else', 'might', 'have', 'screwed', 'up', 'Oh', 'not', 'Dunn', 'band.The', 'purpose', 'Somewhere', 'Back', 'Time', 'tour', 'was', 'offer', 'increasingly', 'younger', 'fan', 'base', 'classics', 'song', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'band', 'perform', 'before', 'band', 'going', 'back', 'classics', 'tour', 'performed', 'songs', 'Rime', 'Ancient', 'Mariner', 'Bruce', 'Dickinson', 'said', 'was', 'favorite', 'song', 'perform', 'tour', 'Can', 'Play', 'Madness', 'always', 'played', 'old', 'stuff', 'further', 'songs', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'course', 'tour', 'still', 'featured', 'songs', 'always', 'play', 'Number', 'Beast', 'Fear', 'Dark', 'stage', 'set', 'was', 'even', 'reminiscent', 'one', 'used', 'Powerslave', 'tour', 'mixed', 'little', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'very', 'good', 'live', 'footage', 'shown', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'blow', 'away', 'band', 'amazing.It', 'also', 'people', 'talking', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'hear', 'instance', 'Priest', 'who', 'many', 'tattoos', 'band', 'claims', 'be', 'biggest', 'fan', 'someone', 'saying', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'concert', 'how', 'long', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'etc', 'may', 'sound', 'boring', 'here', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'see', 'road', 'crew', 'how', 'build', 'stage', 'fans', 'nearly', 'making', 'riot', 'hotel', 'where', 'band', 'everyone', 'was', 'having', 'fun', 'tour', 'everyone', 'smiles', 'tells', 'jokes', 'fools', 'around', 'something', 'see', 'band', 'enjoy', 'others', 'company', 'still', 'selling', 'out', 'concerts', 'world.Iron', 'Maiden', 'always', 'been', 'exciting', 'watch', 'DVD', 'reason', 'why', 'also', 'get', 'disc', '17', 'live', 'songs', 'used', 'Flight', '666', 'soundtrack', 'songs', 'have', 'been', 'picked', 'different', 'cities', 'so', 'song', 'different', 'show', 'altogether', 'film', 'good', 'part', 'disc', 'already', 'only', 'want', 'watch', 'live', 'part', 'nice', 'have', 'have', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'already', 'good', 'dozen', 'times', 'time', 'find', 'as', 'good', 'before', 'Live', 'Death', 'best', 'Maiden', 'concert', 'DVD', 'Flight', '666', 'great', 'look', 'band', 'just', 'as', 'good', ""'re"", 'fan', 'must', 'never', 'before', 'Maiden', 'been', 'shown', 'way', 'hard', 'believe', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'hard', 'describe', 'are', 'fan', 'band', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'this.There', 'two', 'versions', 'special', 'edition', 'better', 'booklet', 'own', 'standard', 'edition', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'available']",Iron Maiden: Flight 666
1244270,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B001W63DX2,trebe,"[3, 4]","Flight 666 is a two DVD set that documents the beginning of Iron Maiden's 2008 Somewhere Back In Time World Tour.  The project was a unique 23 city tour, spanning several continents, starting in Mumbai, India and ending in Toronto, Canada, with the band and road crew travelling between cities on a private 757 jet, known as `Ed Force One'.  One disc (The Film) contains a 112 minute documentary of the endeavor, covering the genesis of the project, and the logistical issues involved, along with interviews, conversations and behind the scenes looks at the band.  There is some live footage, but no complete songs are featured.  The second disc (The Concert) contains sixteen live performances, with each song from a different city on the tour.  While you may have seen Maiden live before, you probably have not seen them quite like this.One of the vanguards of heavy metal, Iron Maiden made their recording debut nearly thirty years ago. Following the release of their album Powerslave in 1985, and near the peak of their popularity, the band embarked on the World Slavery Tour.  From this tour came the live recording `Live After Death' on both vinyl and CD, and finally in 2008, a two disc DVD release of the historic Long Beach Arena performance with bonus materials.  The Somewhere Back in Time tour, is an attempt to revisit those times, part of which includes adopting the Egyptian motif for the stage d&eacute;cor, similar to that used for the World Slavery tour.  The set list includes concert staples, as well as songs from post-Powerslave albums, up to Fear of the Dark.Flight 666 is for both the casual and hardcore Maiden fan.  Judging by the audiences that turned out for their performances on this tour, the number of devoted fans appears to be quite massive worldwide.  Given the current state of music, with metal receiving little airplay or publicity, it is encouraging to see that Maiden is drawing in new young fans, many who were not even born at the time of the original World Slavery Tour.  With the popularity of other genres of music, and vocal based phenomena like American Idol, it is nice to know that a rock band that actually plays real music, has such a huge, well-deserved, international following.  The documentary provides an interesting look at the tour and those that made it happen, and updates regarding how the members of band are doing.The second disc featuring the live performances, is what most will want to see.  Tightly edited, each number is preceded by the song title, location, and date of the performance.  The video quality is first class, with many views of the massive stage, the band and the audience.  Again similar to Rock in Rio, there is not much time in between cuts.  Vocalist Bruce Dickinson is still favoring the funky pants with reflective strips, and dons costumes or employs props for specific songs, such as a red cavalry coat and British flag for The Trooper.  Also making reappearance during Powerslave, is the bird's head mask, which was part of the World Slavery tour.  Bruce looks to be very fit, and full of energy, roaming over the stage, and not holding back in hitting the high notes.A barefoot Niko McBrain delivers his usual high energy performance on drums.  Steve Harris, the heartbeat of the band, while still aggressive, seems to be a bit more in the background than usual, an impression which may be due to the editing.  Much of the material featured is from the period when the band was a quintet with Dave Murray and Adrian Smith on guitar, and perhaps looking to replicate the Murray/Smith solos from the original recordings, the majority of the lead guitar parts are divided up along those original lines.  This kind of leaves guitarist Janick Gers, as the odd man out, with few opportunities to play lead (Fear of the Dark and Moonchild probably being his most prominent efforts).  On Rock in Rio, which featured mostly material from Gers' time with the band, this was certainly not the case, as Janick did a lot of lead work.  Still the chemistry within the band seems to be fine, with good spirits all around.  Dave Murray as always is an amazing soloist, and Adrian Smith squeezes some remarkable licks from his instrument, as the solos in particular do indeed have the character of the classic original versions.  The overall quality of the band's musicianship is close to perfection.Noteworthy are the selections from Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (Moonchild, The Clairvoyant, Can I Play with Madness), and Somewhere In Time (Heaven Can Wait, Wasted Years), which haven't been featured live recently.  The band stretches out on the epic Rime of the Ancient Mariner, but even more boldness would have been truly fabulous.  Adding a few obscure songs like Stranger In a Strange Land, Die With Your Boots On, Caught Somewhere in Time, To Tame a Land, or Alexander the Great would have taken things even further.  Still, this is a very solid selection of 80's Maiden material.  If that is your favorite time period for the band, this set and Live After Death, would be the ones to look at, depending on whether the actual, or retro version is to your liking.  Maiden usually gives their fans a lot.  The packaging is like a book, with booklet type liner notes, with plenty of background information and photos.Remarkably, this was just the first leg of the Somewhere Back in Time tour for 2008.  The band hit the road again in May 2008 playing in the USA and Canada, then finishing up in Europe in August.  Maiden were back out again in the spring of 2009, hitting the middle east, India, New Zealand, Central and South America, finishing in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  Icons in the world of heavy metal, Iron Maiden continue to do what other bands can only dream of doing.  Bigger, bolder, better, it's hard to top Maiden.  Hopefully, after the band recharges their batteries they will get back into the studio for another metal masterwork.  For now, the fans can all enjoy Flight 666.  You get quite a lot, for a very reasonable price.",4,Somewhere Back in Time . . .,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",2009,6023,"['Flight', '666', 'two', 'DVD', 'set', 'documents', 'beginning', 'Iron', 'Maiden',
