567409,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000055YVT,Alex Udvary,"[3, 5]","So many people have been criticizing this movie. Look at all the 1 star reviews, it's just not fair. I would like to know if the people who hated this movie were Altman fans to begin with. I really don't think they were, otherwise, they knew what they were getting in for. If your familiar with Altman's style, then I don't understand, what the problem is someone would have with this movie. Altman constantly makes movies with ""no plot"". There's never a strong central story-line. Or really devolped characters. But, either you accept this or you don't. I'll freely admit some of his movies work and some don't. I think what happened with this movie was, too many non-Altman fans went to see this and didn't know what to expect. I honestly think that's what happened here.  For those who don't know this Altman film written by Anne Rapp is about a Dallas gynecologist, Dr. Sully Travis (Richard Gere) and the ""women"" in his life, which include; his wife (Farrah Fawcett) whom is suffering from a disease where she has sorta went ""crazy"" after getting too much love from her husband. Then there's his daughters; Connie (Tara Reid) who is about to get married, but, keeps a very dark and shocking secret about her sex life. Also there's his other daughter Dee Dee (Kate Hudson). And at work their's his co-worker Carolyn (Shelley Long), and a woman who he now has a crush on Bree Davis (Helen Hunt). Altman was fooling around with an idea that another movie tried more successfully, ""What Women Want"". ""Dr. T..ect"" tried to figure that one out itself. First he thinks a woman would want to feel loved by her husband, then he learn that, that's what drove his wife into the condition she's in. He then thinks that woman like a take charge kind of guy, as in the case with the Helen Hunt charcater, only he finds out he was wrong again! Now, I'm not going to say that ""Dr.T & The Women"" is one of the greatest movies ever made, it most certainly is not. I'm sure many won't think it's Altman's best, but, the movie does have moments that work well. There are some parts that made me laugh. There were other parts that worked up on the emotional level it wanted to hit. It has a nice blend that sometimes works. People are really being far too harsh on this movie. THIS IS NOT FOR NON-ALTMAN FANS! If you've never seen an Altman film don't start here! Watch ""M*A*S*H"", or ""The Player"". If you already like Altman's films you won't be disappointed. A pretty good movie on Altman's scale of things (notice I said on his scale of things, not in general). *** 1\2 out of *****",3,"The Amercian Public Isn't Giving ""The Doctor"" A Fair Shake!",991699200,"06 5, 2001",2001,2568,"['So', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'been', 'criticizing', 'movie', 'Look', '1', 'star', 'reviews', 'just', 'not', 'fair', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'hated', 'movie', 'were', 'Altman', 'fans', 'begin', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'were', 'otherwise', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'getting', 'familiar', 'Altman', 'style', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'problem', 'someone', 'would', 'have', 'movie', 'Altman', 'constantly', 'movies', 'plot', 'never', 'strong', 'central', 'story-line', 'really', 'devolped', 'characters', 'either', 'accept', 'do', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'freely', 'admit', 'movies', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'many', 'non-Altman', 'fans', 'went', 'see', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'honestly', 'think', 'what', 'happened', 'here', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Altman', 'film', 'written', 'Anne', 'Rapp', 'Dallas', 'gynecologist', 'Dr.', 'Sully', 'Travis', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'women', 'life', 'include', 'wife', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'whom', 'suffering', 'disease', 'where', 'sorta', 'went', 'crazy', 'getting', 'too', 'much', 'love', 'husband', 'Then', 'daughters', 'Connie', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'who', 'get', 'married', 'very', 'dark', 'shocking', 'secret', 'sex', 'life', 'Also', 'other', 'daughter', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'work', 'co-worker', 'Carolyn', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'woman', 'who', 'now', 'crush', 'Bree', 'Davis', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Altman', 'was', 'fooling', 'around', 'idea', 'movie', 'tried', 'more', 'successfully', 'What', 'Women', 'Want', 'Dr.', 'T..ect', 'tried', 'figure', 'one', 'out', 'First', 'woman', 'would', 'want', 'feel', 'loved', 'husband', 'then', 'what', 'drove', 'wife', 'condition', 'then', 'woman', 'take', 'charge', 'kind', 'guy', 'case', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'charcater', 'only', 'out', 'was', 'wrong', 'again', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'Dr.T', 'Women', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'most', 'certainly', 'not', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'wo', ""n't"", 'think', 'Altman', 'best', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'work', 'well', 'are', 'parts', 'made', 'laugh', 'were', 'other', 'parts', 'worked', 'up', 'emotional', 'level', 'wanted', 'hit', 'nice', 'blend', 'sometimes', 'People', 'are', 'really', 'being', 'far', 'too', 'harsh', 'movie', 'THIS', 'NOT', 'FOR', 'NON-ALTMAN', 'FANS', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Altman', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'here', 'Watch', 'M*A*S*H', 'Player', 'already', 'Altman', 'films', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'Altman', 'scale', 'things', 'notice', 'said', 'scale', 'things', 'not', 'general', '1\\2', '*****']",Dr. T & the Women
567410,A1AHFIGBYPZTXC,B000055YVT,Amazon Customer,"[9, 12]","Robert Altman's latest ensemble piece opens with a scene that basically fills in the background from which the rest of the film will spring. In a gynecologist's office in Dallas, his upscale clients are fighting tooth and nail to get into his stirrups. The roving camera shows us high society Southern belles in sequined suits and extravagant hats ready to claw the eyes out of each other's heads to get the undivided attention of his staff. That din of shrieking women is Dr. T.'s life.Richard Gere plays Dr. Sullivan &quot;Sully&quot; Travis, a man with a few too many problems. His wife (Farah Fawcett) has succumbed to a condition called the Hestia Complex that leaves her in a mental hospital after a nude frolic in a shopping mall fountain. His two daughters Connie (Tara Reid) and Dee Dee (Kate Hudson) are hashing out the details of the latter's upcoming wedding. Connie is flunking out of Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders training camp. Dee Dee's interests might lie elsewhere. His sister-in-law Peggy (Laura Dern) is divorcing her husband and has, with three matching kids, moved into his home. His office manager Carolyn (Shelley Long) thinks she may have just what the ole doc needs. And the new golf instructor in town (Helen Hunt) is just too interesting to keep out of his mind for more then 10 minutes. All in a day's work.Of course Altman is known for these sort of huge casts and can often handle them very well indeed (MASH, Short Cuts, etc), but lately he hasn't come up with a big winner. Last year's Cookie's Fortune is probably his best of late and, while very watchable, Dr. T. pales in comparison to even that modest success. Both films are set in the South and feature a lot of local flavor. Being a native Dallasite myself, I don't think you can make a film based here without mentioning Tom Landry - it's probably a local ordinance. Altman also definitively identifies Dallas' alpha male culture with golf, patio grills, hunting, football and, of course, women.I'd have to agree with Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly when he says, &quot;This may be the last place in America where feminism and chivalry could still be duking it out.&quot; I always open the door for a woman (and hold it for any more that may be coming). I wouldn't cuss in casual conversation with a woman I didn't know, although I probably would with a man. And I don't personally like women who drink or have tattoos either. I say all this to give you an indication of the way most men are raised in Texas and Altman has captured that perfectly.Sully is a guy who just wants his life to settle down and let him catch a breath. Mainly that means his daughters and sister-in-law, a blonde trio that harries him with every demand and never manages a thought outside their own little social circle. While provocative, the women that torture him never really become full fledged characters. Even Liv Tyler who shows up as the bridesmaid from Houston has only a few words in the entire film, none of which give us a hint as to who she is. The one person who might save him (and the film) is Helen Hunt but her role as the one rock steady female in the story is cut short in the effort to include so many of the others.While Gere does an admirable job as the decent, honest and confused man, Altman just doesn't give us enough time to get to know these folks. He's sure to do better in the future (as he has in the past), but at least Dr. T.is an interesting failure. The final scene seems like a return nod to P.T. Anderson's Magnolia, which was fun to see but probably my favorite part was Laura Dern's three little girls. All dressed alike and on their little leashes. It reminds me of two kids I met while in high school. Their knucklehead parents actually named the twin boy and girl &quot;Cotton&quot; and &quot;Candy&quot;.

Gere's actually not half-bad here, but he has the advantage of playing the only character who's not a complete cariciture.  Altman is so hung-up on lampooning the woman of Dallas, that he's presented us with a bunch of stereotypes.Helen Hunt, of course, plays Helen Hunt, a role which she has almost perfected.  In this movie, the Hunt character goes by the name of Bree.  This individual is supposedly a golf pro.  Spent 8 years on the LPGA tour, according to the dialog.  So she steps up to the first tee with Gere, gives it the ol' baseball grip and proceeds to hit the ball with the absolute worst golf swing ever seen on celluloid (oh...second-worst...forgot about Matt Damon).

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 2]","This movie starred Richard Gere as Dr T, a Dallas Texas based gynecologist with a way with women -- until they all get to be too much for him. It would have been way better if it had been called Mr T and the women, and if Mr T had played the character he created for the ""A"" Team, B.A. Baracus, as a Dallas, Texas based gynecologist. When Dr T's wife, Kate (Farrah Fawcett), took off her clothes and swam in the shopping mall fountain, he would have just looked at her and said ""Shut up, fool. You ain't no fish."" As the women of Dallas made plans for Dr T's daughter's wedding, it seemed like they were taking over the world. You couldn't swing a dead cat without hitting a dysfunctional blonde pre menstrual or post menopausal woman. Mr T would have summed up the situation and said something pithy and insightful, like ""I pity the fool who goes out tryin' a' take over da world, then runs home cryin' to her momma!""Or what if the Dr T had been Dr. Terwilliker, from The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T., who had an insane plan to enslave 500 boys in his Piano Academy and force them to practice 24/7 on his magnificent piano? With a script by Dr. Seuss, and starring Hans Conried as Dr. Terwilliker! Take Dr. Terwilliker, and make him a gynecologist instead of a piano teacher, set the whole thing in Texas. Can't you just imagine Dr. T. singing ""I want my lavender spats!"" out on the Texas range? That would have been Atomic. VERY atomic!Instead of that magnificent spectacle we are forced to settle for second Gere and Altman's workaday mise-en-sc&egrave;ne. At first Gere is a doctor who thinks women are the best thing since sliced bread, but Dr T grows to despise them as their needs, imagined ailments, and, as Dr Terwilliker would say, their ""idiotic cock-eyed flum-dummery"" overwhelms him.This film is chock full of beautiful and talented women, like Farrah Fawcett, Laura Dern, Shelley Long, Kate Hudson, Tara Reid and Liv Tyler, but it doesn't really like women. The film is a mysoginist. Only Helen Hunt escapes its hellish fury, as a golf pro who toys with Dr T, but then tosses him aside, just like a man would do. Dr T says he is attracted to her because she wasn't like all the other women. If she was a woman who acted like a man, that would explain a lot, Dr Freud.Was the scene of Kate Hudson practicing her routine with the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders merely gratuitous, or was it integral to the plot? I would have to go with merely gratuitous. Or how about the scene where Kate Hudson and Liv Tyler make out? Once again, gratuitous. But as long as we're being gratuitous... Liv Tyler isn't the only one who wished they would have used more tongue and ""gone for it.""The ending seems not only preposterous, but is also patronizing. I won't give it away, but suffice it to say that Gere's Dr T  still thinks he is god's gift to women, but in reality women have been having babies without any help (apart from a small initial investment) from men for thousands of years.-----------------------Hannibal: B.A., there's an old saying - ""The best defense is a good offense.""B.A. Baracus: You got that wrong, man.

At times his waiting room resembles a kindergarten class where each child is demanding immediate time on the overwhelmingly popular toy. His wife, superbly played by Farrah Fawcett, has rapidly degenerated into a childlike state, reaching the point where he has no choice but to institutionalize her. One of his daughters is going to get married soon and there are several other relatives in various states of need.Into all of this, the good Dr. T. meets a recently arrived female golf pro played by Helen Hunt and a romance rapidly develops. It is a very modern romance, Gere is still wearing his wedding ring and the first time he is at the golf pro's apartment, she walks naked in his view from one room to the shower.Dr. T. also has his male buddies that he goes hunting with. They are very good friends, yet while their ties are deep, they are also tenuous. As the movie progresses, it is natural to believe that it will end with some dramatic and romantic scene where the Gere character sweeps the Hunt character off her feet to the background of some soft music. Fortunately, that is not the case, the ending is unusual and completely unexpected, and an event that in my opinion made this move. Rather than go the route of the formulaic ending, Altman chooses to go a bit weird, whisking the Gere character off against his will to an extremely isolated location. When the movie ends, you have no idea whether what you are seeing is supposed to be real or a post death fantasy of the Gere character.",3,"Not the brightest of movies, but the unusual ending rescues it",1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,1627,"['Richard', 'Gere', 'overworked', 'gynecologist', 'clientele', 'largely', 'rich', 'women', 'demand', 'be', 'pampered', 'times', 'waiting', 'room', 'kindergarten', 'class', 'where', 'child', 'demanding', 'immediate', 'time', 'overwhelmingly', 'popular', 'toy', 'wife', 'superbly', 'played', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', 'rapidly', 'degenerated', 'childlike', 'state', 'reaching', 'point', 'where', 'choice', 'institutionalize', 'One', 'daughters', 'going', 'get', 'married', 'soon', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'relatives', 'various', 'states', 'good', 'Dr.', 'T.', 'recently', 'arrived', 'female', 'golf', 'pro', 'played', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'romance', 'rapidly', 'very', 'modern', 'romance', 'Gere', 'still', 'wearing', 'wedding', 'ring', 'first', 'time', 'golf', 'pro', 'apartment', 'walks', 'naked', 'view', 'one', 'room', 'shower.Dr', 'T.', 'also', 'male', 'buddies', 'hunting', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'friends', 'yet', 'ties', 'are', 'deep', 'are', 'also', 'tenuous', 'movie', 'natural', 'believe', 'will', 'end', 'dramatic', 'romantic', 'scene', 'where', 'Gere', 'character', 'Hunt', 'character', 'feet', 'background', 'soft', 'music', 'Fortunately', 'not', 'case', 'ending', 'unusual', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'event', 'opinion', 'made', 'move', 'Rather', 'go', 'route', 'formulaic', 'ending', 'Altman', 'go', 'bit', 'weird', 'whisking', 'Gere', 'character', 'off', 'will', 'extremely', 'isolated', 'location', 'When', 'movie', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'are', 'seeing', 'supposed', 'be', 'real', 'post', 'death', 'fantasy', 'Gere', 'character']",Dr. T & the Women

At first, 'Dr. T' seems like one of those neanderthal, anti-feminist 'comedies' from the 1970s that stretched their 'laughs' from how funny and silly and shallow and brittle 'powerful' women really are.  Dr. T is a popular gynacologist, with a large and demanding clientele.  The opening credits manages in familiar Altman-style to catch the dynamics of a group, in this case a gaggle of rich, bored, aroused, hysterical women who can't stop chattering at a soon-incomprehensbile pitch.  Dr. T's all-female family, loving but spoiled, similarly babble, a tendency heightened by the upcoming wedding of one daughter, and the steady mental deterioration of his wife.  Amid all the female hubbub, Dr. T is a beacon of quiet sanity, a man so inured to women's bodies, he has to cant about their spiritual uniqueness.  His outings with his buddies for golf and hunting may seem ridiculous in their posturing, but, compared to the amazons, offer a manly calm.Had 'Dr. T' continued in this vein, it would have been fair enough to label it misogynistic. But having wound us up into thinking it's about one thing, Altman imperceptibly shows that the film's about another, shaking T's absrudly (I mean, 'T'!) pompous complacency.  While the women become increasingly complex - the ploy of not showing Kate Hudson's bridegroom suggests she's only interested in the material and social trappings of a wedding, but this absence is revealed to have a strong emotional basis - Dr. T finds himself unable to deal with them as real, as opposed to his categorised Ideal.  Most piquantly, the attraction of golf professional Helen Hunt, is that she is more like a man than a woman, implying a suppressed homosexuality in T that paralells that of his daughter.Dr. T was generally considered a failure on its release, and although Altman dutifully marshalls his trademark visual rhythms, that glorious dance between off-hand characterisation, mobile wide-screen camera and fluid editing, it never becomes anything special.  This is arguably because the characters are all, male and female, too shrill; because the script isn't sharp enough; or because Gere - brilliant, but slyly passive - leaves a black hole at its centre.  Having said that, second-rate Altman is more fun than almost anything else currently available, and the various group crescendos have their comic moments, though the cod-Tennesse Williamisms are an easy target.",3,"Grossly under-rated, relaxed Altman.",1015804800,"03 11, 2002",2002,2466,"['Altman', 'red', 'rag', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'play', 'first', 'T', 'one', 'neanderthal', 'anti-feminist', ""'comedies"", '1970s', 'stretched', ""'laughs"", 'how', 'funny', 'silly', 'shallow', 'brittle', ""'powerful"", 'women', 'really', 'are', 'Dr.', 'T', 'popular', 'gynacologist', 'large', 'demanding', 'clientele', 'opening', 'credits', 'manages', 'familiar', 'Altman-style', 'catch', 'dynamics', 'group', 'case', 'gaggle', 'rich', 'bored', 'aroused', 'hysterical', 'women', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'chattering', 'soon-incomprehensbile', 'pitch', 'Dr.', 'T', 'all-female', 'family', 'loving', 'spoiled', 'similarly', 'babble', 'tendency', 'heightened', 'upcoming', 'wedding', 'one', 'daughter', 'steady', 'mental', 'deterioration', 'wife', 'female', 'hubbub', 'Dr.', 'T', 'beacon', 'quiet', 'sanity', 'man', 'so', 'inured', 'women', 'bodies', 'cant', 'spiritual', 'uniqueness', 'outings', 'buddies', 'golf', 'hunting', 'may', 'seem', 'ridiculous', 'posturing', 'compared', 'amazons', 'offer', 'manly', 'calm.Had', ""'Dr"", 'T', 'continued', 'vein', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fair', 'enough', 'label', 'misogynistic', 'having', 'wound', 'up', 'thinking', 'one', 'thing', 'Altman', 'imperceptibly', 'film', 'shaking', 'T', 'absrudly', 'mean', 'pompous', 'complacency', 'women', 'become', 'increasingly', 'complex', 'ploy', 'not', 'showing', 'Kate', 'Hudson', 'bridegroom', 'only', 'interested', 'material', 'social', 'trappings', 'wedding', 'absence', 'revealed', 'have', 'strong', 'emotional', 'basis', 'Dr.', 'T', 'unable', 'deal', 'real', 'opposed', 'categorised', 'Ideal', 'Most', 'piquantly', 'attraction', 'golf', 'professional', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'more', 'man', 'woman', 'implying', 'suppressed', 'homosexuality', 'T', 'daughter.Dr', 'T', 'was', 'generally', 'considered', 'failure', 'release', 'Altman', 'dutifully', 'trademark', 'visual', 'rhythms', 'glorious', 'dance', 'off-hand', 'characterisation', 'mobile', 'wide-screen', 'camera', 'fluid', 'editing', 'never', 'anything', 'special', 'arguably', 'characters', 'are', 'male', 'female', 'too', 'shrill', 'script', ""n't"", 'sharp', 'enough', 'Gere', 'brilliant', 'slyly', 'passive', 'black', 'hole', 'centre', 'Having', 'said', 'second-rate', 'Altman', 'more', 'fun', 'almost', 'anything', 'else', 'currently', 'available', 'various', 'group', 'crescendos', 'have', 'comic', 'moments', 'cod-Tennesse', 'Williamisms', 'are', 'easy', 'target']",Dr. T & the Women

This movie has absolutely no energy or pacing behind it at all.

A half hour into it makes you feel as if you've been watching it all day.  The movie is so bad it not only makes you bored, but mad at it as well, mad, too, that  a piece of drek like this can even be made in the first place, with actual money spent on it, when other decent ideas are probably sitting on shelves in Hollywood.  How so many stars managed to appear in it is a mystery to me.  I can just hear their agents:  ""You'll be working with Robert Altman, don't worry about the script!""  Well, somebody should have.  Altman even managed to talk Farrah Fawcett into a brief ""artful"" nude scene, I can just picture that conversation, too:  ""It's art, Farrah!""  The characters she, Gere and others play simply don't work at all.  Here is a movie who's faults lay squarely on the shoulders of the director.  If Altman had any talent to his work at all (I'm not convinced he ever had), then it's all gone dry now.

Though there is the usual large cast you expect from an Altman movie this one is unique in that despite all the periphery confusion it brings an ever increasing focus on just one character, Dr. T himself. Richard Gere has never been one of my favorite actors but he gives an impeccable and likable performance as an always generous and compassionate gynecologist. His wife played by Farrah Fawcett has a breakdown(and gets naked in a fountain) at the mall early on and spends the entire movie institutionalized. His daughters are played by Tara Reid and Kate Hudson, ones a JFK conspiracy nut and the other a lesbian cheerleader(her lover played by Liv Tyler).  Dr. T's work life is equally confusing as he treats one hypochondriac after another. Excellent small part by patient Janine Turner. While his wife is in getting treatment he begins an affair with independent golf pro Helen Hunt. In synopsis the movie sounds wacky and it is but it is also a very solid drama. The movie has a backbone and that is Gere. As his perfect life falls away before him he becomes more and more exposed, vulnerable. Lyle Lovetts soundtrack provides a sober running commentary on one man losing control of his life and how he deals with that.  An ending that will blow you away....highly recommended.

Most Robert Altman films have their emphasis on being erotic, or at least attempting to be erotic.  There is maybe one scene in this film which is slightly erotic; the rest of it does not even pretend to be anything of  a sensual nature.Now, this is not bad, just not what you'd expect from an Altman film.  After watching this movie, I had a feeling it was going to take a beating in the customer reviews (and as you've noticed by now, I was right!).  As others have already noted, this movie is most ASSUREDLY not for everyone.In many ways, what this movies seems to be, at least to me, is kind of a counterpart to the Mel Gibson movie &quot;What Women Want.&quot;  It's curious to note that Helen Hunt starred in that movie as well.  While WWW focused on the noble attributes of the female gender while doing some mild male-bashing, this film does the opposite.  It's not an absolute parallel, however, as this flick only indirectly steers one towards positive male-attributes, while at the same time the theatrical commentary on women is a touch more scathing than that which is directed  towards men in WWW.  Also, WWW is much funnier than the present movie, although Dr. T does have its moments.True much of the general depictions of women in this film are stereotypical.  However, that is not to say that they do not have any footing in reality [again, just like the slams on men in WWW].  With my own personal encounters with women over the years I, for one, could relate to several scenes in this film.  At first I found the ending to be Deus Ex Machina.  However, upon further review, I believe that it was where this film was headed, after all.  The tornado is symbolic of all of the chaos brought to the kindly gynecologist's life by the sundry women in his life.  Nice touch.Again, this movie is not for everyone.  It is border-line misogynistic, but always seems to have just enough charm to refrain from crossing the line &amp; becoming really nasty.  However, most men will be able to identify the impetuous and capricious behavior of the ladies in the story.

To top it all off his ditzy sister in law (Laura Dern) is living in his house with her three daughters.The script has comic possibilities, but Altman's bizarre presentation dissipates it into a chaotic din.  Most every scene is dominated by the constant yakity-yak of ten women tittering and chattering at once.  Clearly, Altman is attempting to lampoon Texas society with his characterizations, but his free-for-all style turns it into amateurish trash of sitcomesque proportion.This film is extremely unflattering to women.  Almost all the women are portrayed as insane over-emotional, irrational, stupid, or hypochondria ridden flakes.  The only woman close to normal is Bree (Helen Hunt), and she is manipulative and self absorbed.  Dr. T, in contrast is levelheaded, rationale, reasonable, sensitive and wonderful.  His shooting pals are also seen as pretty normal guys, if not particularly bright.A treasure trove of acting talent is squandered in the cacophony.  Richard Gere plays a very lovable character, which is a novelty for him.  He is all sensitivity and vulnerability here without a hint of his normal macho impassiveness.  Helen Hunt gives another fine performance as the self-centered golf pro who seems to be Dr. T's refuge from all the crazy women that surround him, but is really using him for her own hedonistic ends.  Farrah Fawcett also gives a terrific rendition of a woman who has taken leave of her wits.  In truth, the entire all-star ensemble is fantastic.  However, great performances with a bad script and a weird director add up to nothing more than so much debris chucked into the frame.I rated this film a 3/10.  The whole is much less than the sum of the parts.  For a film with this many bankable stars to gross only $13.0 million at the box office ($5 million of that in week one) is a clear indication of how poor it is.

As a veteran of the business, he seemed philosophical about the process and saw time as a friend. I haven't seen any of his contemporary films and his seventies work is more of a distant memory so I was able to view 'Dr T' on it's merits. I thought it was a wonderful, touching comedy. The first half is languid and therefore testing. I was interested in Dr T as a character, but only moderately interested in his day. Perhaps the verisimilitude of the women's hairstyles and dress created a homogeneity amongst the characters that was confusing for a time. It all comes together in a funny second half with a finely judged performance from Gere. The charge of mysogyny puzzles me as I found the picture quite affectionate, unless you want to take the final exhortation as some universal statement rather than the wry, character driven epiphany it actually is. I did not find Gere's affair seemingly out of character for a man who claims to respect women, merely prescient of his ambivalence. The Wizard Of Oz like denouement has been problematic for some, but I thought the way it was shot was inspired from a comic standpoint, as was his complete inability to escape his lot in life. On the strength of this, Altman is one of the few directors working today with an original and brilliant vision. If he may not like all humanity (who could?) He is at least interested in it.I also found the film informative in other ways. I had always wondered how men and women actually get to go to bed with one another. This film takes you through the entire process and in the unlikely event I manage to get away from the PC and find myself in a similar situation, thanks to Mr Altman, I will at least have some clue as to what to do. The film does not cover the morning after aspect of the whole event but perhaps 'Gosford Park' will enlighten me further. I hear it's jolly good.

His modus operandi is to get together a talented cast, give them the outlines of a scene and let them improvise a good deal of it.  Sometimes it works brilliantly (MASH, NASHVILLE, McCABE & MRS MILLER) and sometimes it falls flat, but even when he stumbles, he is at least interesting. DR. T. & THE WOMEN is not one of his great successes, but it isn't quite the failure that a lot of the reviewers below (and elsewhere) suggest.If this movie was marketed as a light comedy and not as another Altman experiment, then it is understandable that a good chunk of the viewing audience would feel like they've been ripped off.  There are many comic--and some downright loopy--moments, but this is not a hardy har har Hollywood comedy, or even a rambunctious nouvelle-comedie a la the Farrellys.  I don't even know if it really should be called  ""a barbed social commentary,"" since that term doesn't really seem to do justice to Altman's jaundiced worldview.  The oft-cited misogyny is actually a more-inclusive misanthropy (hey, those duck hunters aren't exactly appealing either).  As for Gere's Dr. T himself, he is, as others have noted, charming, affable, and seemingly on top of the world--until his world falls apart at the proverbial seams.  Through it all, Gere maintains something of his own (I imagine) real-life Buddhist serenity, until he doesn't.  It's a an intriguing performance by an often underrated actor.The film's abrupt non-sequitor dreamlike ending evokes THE WIZARD OF OZ, only with Mexicans instead of Munchkins.  It's also reminiscent of another Altman film about women, 1977's brooding, poetic THREE WOMEN, which also ended in a dreamy idyll. Both seem to have something to do with escape from your stereotypical ""American Dream turned nightmare,"" both seem somehow too to end up in some poetic realm beyond such notions.",3,"What do Altman films with""Women"" in the title have in common",1038182400,"11 25, 2002",2002,2038,"['have', 'even', 'passing', 'knowledge', 'cinema', 'then', 'should', 'come', 'surprise', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'movie', 'definition', 'Amazon', 'critic', 'above', 'noted', 'loose-limbed', 'affair', 'modus', 'operandi', 'get', 'together', 'talented', 'cast', 'give', 'outlines', 'scene', 'let', 'improvise', 'good', 'deal', 'brilliantly', 'MASH', 'NASHVILLE', 'McCABE', 'MRS', 'MILLER', 'flat', 'even', 'when', 'least', 'interesting', 'DR.', 'T.', 'THE', 'WOMEN', 'not', 'one', 'great', 'successes', ""n't"", 'quite', 'failure', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'elsewhere', 'suggest.If', 'movie', 'was', 'marketed', 'light', 'comedy', 'not', 'Altman', 'experiment', 'then', 'understandable', 'good', 'chunk', 'viewing', 'audience', 'would', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'ripped', 'off', 'are', 'many', 'comic', 'downright', 'loopy', 'moments', 'not', 'hardy', 'har', 'har', 'Hollywood', 'comedy', 'even', 'rambunctious', 'nouvelle-comedie', 'la', 'Farrellys', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'barbed', 'social', 'commentary', 'term', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'do', 'justice', 'Altman', 'jaundiced', 'worldview', 'oft-cited', 'misogyny', 'actually', 'more-inclusive', 'misanthropy', 'hey', 'duck', 'hunters', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'appealing', 'Gere', 'Dr.', 'T', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'charming', 'affable', 'seemingly', 'top', 'world', 'world', 'apart', 'proverbial', 'seams', 'Gere', 'something', 'own', 'imagine', 'real-life', 'Buddhist', 'serenity', ""n't"", 'intriguing', 'performance', 'often', 'underrated', 'actor.The', 'film', 'abrupt', 'non-sequitor', 'dreamlike', 'ending', 'WIZARD', 'OF', 'OZ', 'only', 'Mexicans', 'instead', 'Munchkins', 'also', 'reminiscent', 'Altman', 'film', 'women', '1977', 'brooding', 'poetic', 'THREE', 'WOMEN', 'also', 'ended', 'dreamy', 'idyll', 'seem', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'escape', 'stereotypical', 'American', 'Dream', 'turned', 'nightmare', 'seem', 'somehow', 'too', 'end', 'up', 'poetic', 'realm', 'such', 'notions']",Dr. T & the Women

Bad movies are often funny to watch, cheaply made shtick. Then there' horrible movies that are meant to be very serious and have potential and then are really awful.This movie, is the latter of the two.Looking at the cast one says ""Whoa, this movie must rock!"". Sadly it doesn't even summon up a pebble, let alone a whole rock.The actors barely get a chance to act. The plot is thin and boring. This isn't even a thinking mans movie, or a chick flick, or a sexy flick. It's so bad the only thing I could classify it as is ""other: morbidly boring and inane"".Not to give away the nonexistent story but Gere plays a middle aged OB/GYN whose family is highly dysfunctional and getting worse by the day. His teenage daughters are driving him crazy and his wife (who already is crazy) is no consolation. He turns to the new, sexy and attractive golf pro at his country club, played by Helen Hunt. The affair seems forced and rather uninteresting. Honestly the high point of the film is you see Hunt take off her blouse from a distance, but even this rather sexy scene ends without offering a saving grace to this film.The movie ends in a sort of quasi ""Kubrik"" dreamesque sequence where Gere drives into a hurricane and gets swept off to OZ, no wait that would have been more entertaining.

567440,A152C8GYY25HAH,B000055YVT,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","Director Robert Altman's movie, Dr. T and the Women might best be described as lesser Altman. It doesn't have the range or the power of his early works, such as M.A.S.H., Nashville or McCabe and Mrs. Miller. The satire isn't as biting or as insightful as it is in his more recent films like The Player and Short Cuts. Still, lesser Altman is better than the best movies of half the directors at work today.Dr. T, is the nickname of Dr. Sullivan Travis, a Dallas gynecologist who is much favored by the city's wealthy and influential women. Both at work and at home, where he lives with his wife and two daughters, as well as a recently moved-in sister and her three girls, Dr. T's world is one filled with women. Even the new assistant golf pro at his country club is female. About his only contact with other males is the hunting and fishing afternoons he shares with three buddies. This is not a man besieged by the opposite sex. This is one who is quite happy with his situation in life. He considers himself fortunate.His world begins to come apart when his wife, Kate [Farrah Fawcett], has a major nervous breakdown in the middle of one of the city's most fashionable malls. She winds up in a posh institution where she is diagnosed as suffering from something called the Hestia complex, a condition in which a woman falls apart from being loved too much. (Whether or not such a condition actually exists is beside the point.) Meanwhile, Dr. T has a practice to attend to, as well as a daughter who is about to be married. It isn't long before the new golf pro catches his eyes. As is often the case in real life, it doesn't take long for a content and ordered life to unravel in the right circumstances.Richard Gere has never been nicer than he is as Dr. T. The chemistry between him and both Ms. Fawcett and Helen Hunt, who plays the golf pro, is much stronger than it was with Wynona Ryder in last year's Autumn in New York. He hasn't lost his touch. Indeed, his interaction with all the women in this picture is a lot of fun to watch. All of the actresses are strong, especially Laura Dern as the hard-drinking sister, Shelley Long as T's office manager, and Liv Tyler as Marilyn, his daughter's maid of honor and the one who is the ultimate undoing of the wedding. Altman has a history of creating strong roles for women. It is no wonder so many actresses line up to work with him, despite the fact that the pay is far less than they usually get.Dr. T and the Women has been criticized for being antifeminist. I don't think that it is. Altman is a satirist. In this movie he takes a look at a certain type of woman, namely the kind who marries well and finds it neither necessary nor fulfilling to work. Many such women still exist, and I personally do not begrudge their right to live as they please. To each his own. They are, however, not sacrosanct and are as fair a target of satire as any other group. Besides, if being always politically correct means that one has to cast aside one's sense of humor, then I say that a little political incorrectness is always in order.",3,Lesser Robert Altman film has its moments,1016323200,"03 17, 2002",2002,3086,"['Director', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'movie', 'Dr.', 'T', 'Women', 'might', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'lesser', 'Altman', ""n't"", 'have', 'range', 'power', 'early', 'works', 'such', 'M.A.S.H.', 'Nashville', 'McCabe', 'Mrs.', 'Miller', 'satire', ""n't"", 'biting', 'as', 'insightful', 'more', 'recent', 'films', 'Player', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'Still', 'lesser', 'Altman', 'better', 'best', 'movies', 'directors', 'work', 'today.Dr', 'T', 'nickname', 'Dr.', 'Sullivan', 'Travis', 'Dallas', 'gynecologist', 'who', 'much', 'favored', 'city', 'wealthy', 'influential', 'women', 'work', 'home', 'where', 'wife', 'two', 'daughters', 'as', 'well', 'recently', 'moved-in', 'sister', 'three', 'girls', 'Dr.', 'T', 'world', 'one', 'filled', 'women', 'Even', 'new', 'assistant', 'golf', 'pro', 'country', 'club', 'female', 'only', 'contact', 'other', 'males', 'hunting', 'fishing', 'afternoons', 'shares', 'three', 'buddies', 'not', 'man', 'besieged', 'opposite', 'sex', 'one', 'who', 'quite', 'happy', 'situation', 'life', 'fortunate.His', 'world', 'come', 'apart', 'when', 'wife', 'Kate', '[', 'Farrah', 'Fawcett', ']', 'major', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'middle', 'one', 'city', 'most', 'fashionable', 'malls', 'up', 'posh', 'institution', 'where', 'diagnosed', 'suffering', 'something', 'called', 'Hestia', 'complex', 'condition', 'woman', 'apart', 'being', 'loved', 'too', 'much', 'Whether', 'not', 'such', 'condition', 'actually', 'point', 'Meanwhile', 'Dr.', 'T', 'practice', 'attend', 'as', 'well', 'daughter', 'who', 'be', 'married', ""n't"", 'long', 'new', 'golf', 'pro', 'eyes', 'often', 'case', 'real', 'life', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'content', 'ordered', 'life', 'unravel', 'right', 'circumstances.Richard', 'Gere', 'never', 'been', 'nicer', 'Dr.', 'T.', 'chemistry', 'Ms.', 'Fawcett', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'who', 'golf', 'pro', 'much', 'stronger', 'was', 'Wynona', 'Ryder', 'last', 'year', 'Autumn', 'New', 'York', ""n't"", 'lost', 'touch', 'Indeed', 'interaction', 'women', 'picture', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'actresses', 'are', 'strong', 'especially', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'hard-drinking', 'sister', 'Shelley', 'Long', 'T', 'office', 'manager', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Marilyn', 'daughter', 'maid', 'honor', 'one', 'who', 'ultimate', 'undoing', 'wedding', 'Altman', 'history', 'creating', 'strong', 'roles', 'women', 'wonder', 'so', 'many', 'actresses', 'line', 'work', 'fact', 'pay', 'far', 'less', 'usually', 'get.Dr', 'T', 'Women', 'been', 'criticized', 'being', 'antifeminist', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Altman', 'satirist', 'movie', 'look', 'certain', 'type', 'woman', 'namely', 'kind', 'who', 'well', 'necessary', 'fulfilling', 'work', 'Many', 'such', 'women', 'still', 'exist', 'personally', 'do', 'not', 'begrudge', 'right', 'live', 'please', 'own', 'are', 'however', 'not', 'sacrosanct', 'are', 'fair', 'target', 'satire', 'other', 'group', 'being', 'always', 'politically', 'correct', 'one', 'cast', 'aside', 'one', 'sense', 'humor', 'then', 'say', 'little', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'always', 'order']",Dr. T & the Women

We figured, ""How can eight marquee-level stars all be wrong?"" After watching the film, we had to ask, ""How did eight marquee-level stars get duped into appearing in this dreck?""I'm flabbergasted to find Dr. T was written by a woman.  Why?  Think of any negative female stereotype, and this film screams it into an amplified bullhorn.  Without exception, ALL the female characters are completely neurotic, ludicrously overdressed, blindly self-absorbed, and chatter incessantly about nothing of substance whatsoever, often several characters at a time crescendoing into a mind-grating cacophony.  (Is this supposed to be avant garde?  'Cause in fact, it's just plain annoying.)  Even Helen Hunt, who at first appears to be the female gender's saving grace and Dr. T's calm in the midst of this maelstrom, (Look out! Don't let me ""ruin"" it for you... if that's possible) turns out to be a man-eater.  Dr. T lovingly states he trusts all women because they're ""natural saints"", but not a single woman in this movie has earned that badge.Enter Dr. T: The Rock of Gibraltar, the only character with more substance than a french fry.  Nothing phases him; not when his wife gets naked in a crowded shopping center and thus is committed to an insane asylum (because, as her psychoanalyst so sincerely puts it, Dr. T. just loved her too much -- puh-LEEZE!), not when his daughter runs into the arms of her lesbian lover rather than her fiancee - at her wedding no less (who didn't see THAT coming?), not when hordes of sex-starved and under-appreciated women clamor into his office almost daily, and no, not even a Texas tornado. That's right. Dr. T. survives being sucked out of his convertable by a tornado that would've made Dorothy and Toto proud and is deposited somewhere in Latin America -- without a scratch!  He literally gets up, dusts himself off, and follows some Spanish speaking children to a remote Latin village just in time to deliver a baby (and yeah, they show EVERYTHING).  Dr. T is Superman!The suspension of disbelief required for this self-indulgent waste of celluloid is going to break the bell curve.

567452,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B000055YVT,Reviewer,"[3, 6]","A universal fact of life, and one of the common elements that tie us all together, is that everyone-- in one way or another-- has problems; or &#65533;Life experiences,&#65533; if you prefer.  All of which, on an individual basis, illustrates what the great philosopher once referred to as the Human Comedy, and which &#65533;Dr. T and the Women,&#65533; directed by Robert Altman, demonstrates cinematically with more than a touch of irony and some insight into human nature.  And, as often happens with a film of this type, it was mistakenly promoted as a comedy, which ultimately may have had a negative impact on the way it was initially received by the public at large.  It is amusing to be sure, and downright funny at times, but only in the way that life is in general, even in the wake of tragedy; hence the saying, &#65533;That&#65533;s life.&#65533;The story centers on Dr. Sullivan Travis (Richard Gere), a gynecologist with a wife, two daughters and a successful practice, who is well liked and admired by his patients.  And he should be; he&#65533;s good looking and charismatic, but most importantly, he&#65533;s a good doctor.  But his personal life is quickly becoming something of a shambles.  His eldest daughter, Dee Dee (Kate Hudson), is about to be married, his youngest, Connie (Tara Reid), is a conspiracy theory activist and his wife, Kate (Farrah Fawcett), to whom he is devoted, is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  He makes a valiant attempt at holding it all together and trying to please everyone, but as always happens in a situation like this, eventually something has to give.  And when it does, it leaves the good doctor at loose ends and forces him to take stock of his life and what it all means, if anything.The first fifteen minutes or so of this movie is so hectic it is nerve-shattering and guaranteed to increase adrenaline levels, and your first reaction may be to scream &#65533;Enough already!&#65533; as the agitation and anxiety that fills the waiting room of Dr. T&#65533;s office threatens to explode off the chart.  But discomfiting as it may be at the moment, it really puts you in the story, and in the final analysis it&#65533;s a good piece of filmmaking by Altman, because it&#65533;s the turmoil of the waiting room that becomes the manifestation of Dr. T&#65533;s inner state of confusion and enables you to relate to him, which in turn gives a vital and necessary perspective to the film.The performances are solid, though only a couple stand out as especially noteworthy.  Gere is believable as the doctor (quite unlike Tom Cruise in &#65533;Eyes Wide Shut,&#65533; who came across as an actor playing a doctor), and maintains the reality of the character by avoiding any superfluous dramatics; he plays him as a man who is what he is and nothing more.  Helen Hunt is good, as always, playing somewhat against type as Bree Davis, a fairly self-absorbed golf pro with rather ambiguous morals, who is willing to give only if what she receives in turn is satisfying to her (Bree is a character of whom Ayn Rand would be proud).  And Farrah Fawcett does a nice job as Kate, but lacks the screen time necessary to really develop her character; the perspective you get of her is established mainly through Dr. T and some of the other characters as they speak of her.Hudson, Reid and Liv Tyler (Marilyn) are all credible in their respective characters, but there is certainly nothing endearing about any of them.  Not that they are unlikable, but because of the way that Altman presents his characters, these are people about whom it is easy to adopt an ambivalent attitude.  The same can be said of Laura Dern, in a somewhat forgettable supporting role as Peggy.  And one can only suspect that this was done intentionally, as it allows Altman to keep the focus of the film on Dr. T.  As Carolyn, the woman who runs Dr. T&#65533;s office, Shelley Long gives one the most memorable performance of the film.  As something of an integral, yet peripheral part of Dr. T&#65533;s life, she is charming and funny-- not to mention agreeably attractive-- and adds some real spunk to the film.  And Janine Turner, as Dorothy, is also impressive as one of Dr. T&#65533;s patients.  These are the two characters, in fact, who really bring this film to life.Of all of the actors in the film, the usually dependable Lee Grant is the only one who gives a somewhat disappointing performance.  In a brief appearance as Dr. Harper, her delivery is too stagy and overblown; in a scene in which she is having a conversation with Dr. T, for example, rather than coming across as a real person having a real discussion with another, she looks like an actor playing a part.  It&#65533;s a performance that may have worked in live theater, but for the intimacy of film it was too much (Olympia Dukakis had the same problem in &#65533;Steel Magnolias).Rounding out the supporting cast are Robert Hays (Harlan), Matt Malloy (Bill) and Andy Richter (Eli).  Altman has a rather stoic, almost aloof way of telling a story, which makes &#65533;Dr. T and the Women&#65533; difficult to embrace emotionally, but it is a good story, and the subtlety of the presentation may invite a reflective moment or two.  If you want comedy, look elsewhere; but for an interesting-- though somewhat quirky-- drama, this may fit the bill.",3,"Stoic, Aloof Film from Robert Altman",997488000,"08 11,

It is probably unhelpful to approach it as though it was a full-blooded satire on wealthy Texas women. For a start, the target is too easy - like the floating and walking birds Dr T and his buddies seem to think it's fair to shoot at - and in any case the focus of the film is not the Women of the title, but Dr T.Richard Gere gives a typically charming and understated, performance as Dr Travis, who is surrounded by women whom he likes and respects in private life, and cares for in his professional life as a gynecologist, but no more understands than most men. Farrah Fawcett gives a touching portrayal as his wife, who retreats into childhood to escape his smothering affection. Helen Hunt, an independently-minded intelligent golf pro, provides a refreshing change - both for Dr T and the audience - from the empty-headed shopaholics who people much of the movie. Laura Dern, Kate Hudson and Shelley Long sparkle as, respectively, Dr T's sister-in-law, daughter and receptionist. As we might expect from Altman, the city of Dallas also plays a leading role; and the best casting is definitely that of Eric Ryan as the &quot;birth baby&quot;.What probably made the movie the flop that it turned out to be was that in a typical Altman way (Pret A Porter?) it meanders on and on, with quite a few side-plots introduced (including an aging ex-wife who obviously has health problems but we never find out if they're mental or physical), but the movie never really comes to a point, nor do we see any sensible conclusion to the side-plots.

Walton ""bibliophile42""","[8, 13]","It would be fair to assume that a movie titled Dr. T &amp; the Women would be one of three types: a cheap B movie about a washed up doctor and a bunch of showgirls, a tacky porn movie, or a lighthearted look at a man who loves and respects the many women in his life. I expected the third and was sadly mistaken.Early in the movie, Dr. Travis describes women as angels who should be worshipped. His problems with the women in his life are supposed to result from his doing just that. His wife suffers from being loved too much, one daughter is spoiled because he gives her everything she needs, his office manager has a crush on him because he's a great boss, his patients love him because he tells them all they're beautiful... it goes on and on.Those are the fictional problems of the character in this movie. Here are my problems . First, there is not a postive female role in the entire picture, with the possible exception of Liv Tyler's character. His wife is loony, his sister in law is a drunk, one daughter's a spoiled brat, the other's a tattletale obsessed with violence, the office manager tries to seduce him, the old bat in the waiting room regularly assaults the young, beautiful, rich, insecure woman who has bi-weekly appointments at the gynecologist because everyone there tells her how beautiful and perfect she is, and the golf pro, supposedly a strong, self-confident woman, is fooling around with a guy who she knows is married. Even Liv Tyler's character, a friend of his daughter in town for the daughter's wedding, is dubious. I mean, if you had to squeeze in a visit to the gynecologist while you were in town, would you really want your best friend's father at the other end of the stirrups?Second, if Dr. T loves women so much, why does he treat them so poorly? He ignores his family, doesn't visit his wife in the mental hospital for six weeks, doesn't get a second opinion when her doctor diagnoses her with some ridiculous condition and recommends he not see her, cheats on his (beloved) wife during that six week period, constantly leaves women in his waiting room for hours on end and, although it doesn't actually say this in the movie, probably doesn't pay his office staff enough to put up with the garbage that they handle for him while he runs out to golf and shoot skeet.Finally, the filmmaker seems to have taken Richard Gere playing a gynecologist as an opportunity to frame his face as often as possible with women's thighs. Do we really need to see him do a breast exam? Is this an integral part of the story? Was the birth scene, shot from the doctor's point of view, necessary? Oh don't worry - this movie couldn't care less about the women in it, so the birth only lasted 15 seconds and was as clean as Martha Stewart's kitchen. It was just an excuse to place Richard Gere between one more pair of female thighs.",1,Disappointing and offensive,986342400,"04 4, 2001",2001,2858,"['would', 'be', 'fair', 'assume', 'movie', 'titled', 'Dr.', 'T', 'amp', 'Women', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'three', 'types', 'cheap', 'B', 'movie', 'washed', 'up', 'doctor', 'bunch', 'showgirls', 'tacky', 'porn', 'movie', 'lighthearted', 'look', 'man', 'who', 'many', 'women', 'life', 'expected', 'third', 'was', 'sadly', 'mistaken.Early', 'movie', 'Dr.', 'Travis', 'women', 'angels', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'worshipped', 'problems', 'women', 'life', 'are', 'supposed', 'result', 'doing', 'just', 'wife', 'suffers', 'being', 'loved', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'daughter', 'spoiled', 'everything', 'office', 'manager', 'crush', 'great', 'boss', 'patients', 'love', ""'re"", 'beautiful', 'are', 'fictional', 'problems', 'character', 'movie', 'Here', 'are', 'problems', 'First', 'not', 'postive', 'female', 'role', 'entire', 'picture', 'possible', 'exception', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'character', 'wife', 'loony', 'sister', 'law', 'drunk', 'one', 'daughter', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'other', 'tattletale', 'obsessed', 'violence', 'office', 'manager', 'seduce', 'old', 'bat', 'waiting', 'room', 'regularly', 'assaults', 'young', 'beautiful', 'rich', 'insecure', 'woman', 'who', 'bi-weekly', 'appointments', 'gynecologist', 'everyone', 'there', 'how', 'beautiful', 'perfect', 'golf', 'pro', 'supposedly', 'strong', 'self-confident', 'woman', 'fooling', 'around', 'guy', 'who', 'married', 'Even', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'character', 'friend', 'daughter', 'town', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'dubious', 'mean', 'had', 'squeeze', 'visit', 'gynecologist', 'were', 'town', 'would', 'really', 'want', 'best', 'friend', 'father', 'other', 'end', 'stirrups', 'Second', 'Dr.', 'T', 'women', 'so', 'much', 'why', 'treat', 'so', 'poorly', 'family', ""n't"", 'visit', 'wife', 'mental', 'hospital', 'six', 'weeks', ""n't"", 'get', 'second', 'opinion', 'when', 'doctor', 'ridiculous', 'condition', 'not', 'see', 'cheats', 'beloved', 'wife', 'six', 'week', 'period', 'constantly', 'women', 'waiting', 'room', 'hours', 'end', ""n't"", 'actually', 'say', 'movie', 'probably', ""n't"", 'pay', 'office', 'staff', 'enough', 'put', 'up', 'garbage', 'handle', 'out', 'golf', 'shoot', 'skeet.Finally', 'filmmaker', 'have', 'taken', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'playing', 'gynecologist', 'opportunity', 'frame', 'face', 'as', 'often', 'possible', 'women', 'thighs', 'Do', 'really', 'need', 'see', 'do', 'breast', 'exam', 'integral', 'part', 'story', 'Was', 'birth', 'scene', 'shot', 'doctor', 'point', 'view', 'necessary', 'Oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'women', 'birth', 'only', 'lasted', '15', 'seconds', 'was', 'as', 'clean', 'Martha', 'Stewart', 'kitchen', 'was', 'just', 'excuse', 'place', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'one', 'more', 'pair', 'female', 'thighs']",Dr. T & the Women

Some say this sprawling, shapeless movies is in genuine Altman-style with goos readon.  All right, they are getting what they want.  But there is another way of talking about it, and that is, Altman is just another overrated director because of his apparently anti-Hollywood attitude or his cynical observation about everthing he dislikes...For those who're interested in the film's plot, ""Dr. T"" displays in its center a gynecologist Richard Gere and his life, which starts to be shaky after his wife Farrah Fawcett is hospitalized due to a rare (fictional) mental disease, which is the result of too much affection given to her.  At the same time around Dr. T's office come countless ladies every day that represent the entire high society of Dallas (where Texas-born writer Anne Rapp once lived).  And Doc must face the wedding day of his daughter when a lovely golfer Helen ""Bree"" Hunt appears in his life.  Troubles and troubles follow.I read a material about this film, in which it is pointed out that the plot is allegorical, partly based on the Book of Job from the Old Testament.  As I can remember the contents of the Book only roughly, I do not go any further than just pointing out, but even so, I don't know how to figure out the way to put the messy script of the film together.  The female characters are all caricatures with various degrees -- for example, Tara Reid is obsessed with JFK assassination, Shelley Long a high-strung nurse, Kate Hudson a lesbian cheerleader, and so on -- and the fashion they are portrayed is not always kind.  I would say not a little nasty.  I wonder for what those good female players came to him (I mean Altman) after all.But the most irritating thing is that their acting is uniformly good, including Gere's.  It seems that only the director didn't do his homework, letting his direction as loose as possible, not knowing where he should go, or what he should do.

But you have to understand that Altman's film doesn't peddle the over-the-top, sleaze-ball attraction of Tom Cruise grinding his pelvis and referring to women in the most degrading fashion imaginable; and yet, lo and behold, it's Altman's gentle satire that was labeled `misogynist' by some because it didn't show any thoroughly exaggerated male characters like P.T. Anderson's not-likely-to-be-remotely- real (except maybe on the Jerry Springer show but that show's all exaggerated for effect anyway and not pretending to be profound) even-as-a-writer-for-Hustler-magazine buffoon, and instead, concentrated mainly on a few, well-drawn and realistic shallow women and one strong and intelligent one.First of all, it must be said, in case people forgot, that this film is a satire, and in a satire people are made to look routinely ridiculous to hopefully enlighten those who can understand and gain some perspective through it, to refine, if applicable, their own behavior by weeding out certain similar types of stubborn and insidious behaviors. It's about exposing vanity and absurdity. And if the balance of satire falls more heavily on the women in this film, there are at least 5 other films made by Altman himself where the opposite is true. But even this film is far from one sided when looked at more closely. How exactly are the men that go hunting with Dr.T, not made to look like idiots? And so what if Dr. T himself is made to look only `gallantly foolish' for being `too nice' (therefore causing his wife Farrah Fawcett to go into `Childhood regression' ) ? Isn't a character criticized for being `too accommodating' and intemperate in the opposite direction from the one so overwhelmingly depicted in almost every other satire, highly original in itself? Where else have you ever seen a character like this? Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate"" maybe? But he was a confused kid with no money and Gere is a successful gynecologist making bank! The almost Marcus-Welby-like, meticulously polite and accommodating Dr. T. gynecologist character is as rare a subject for satire as any, and he is satirized for sure, but not in as obvious a way as his patients and family members, i.e., `the women,' who bear the burden of his intemperate `niceness' (and maybe take advantage of it in ways that they themselves don't realize). It's easy to mistake it for a `faultless' depiction, because the fault happens to be an excess of something everyone considers a virtue when not in excess. But an excess of politeness and accommodation is definitely a fault and maybe even a vice and it will get you in a lot of unexpected trouble.  Dr. T's doesn't know why he's made a mess of his life but we do, and that's immensely fascinating (especially since chronic `nice guy' syndrome is widespread in society and potentially much more harmful than people think if not checked by some stronger, harsher, more truthful, and ultimately healthier realities).And so what if most of the women in Richard Gere's office are shown to be annoying idiots that drive him up the wall day after day, and whom he has to accommodate because it's his job? So what if most of the women in his family are relative airheads? Isn't the Helen Hunt `golf coach' character the opposite number from all these airheads? Isn't her character one of the strongest, most independent minded women depicted in a film for quite a while? Doesn't she come to Gere's office and sit in the midst of a whole roomful of bickering women with quiet, dignified detachment? Doesn't she sleep with Richard Gere on a first date because she feels like it, fully aware that he will not look at her as `easy' or in any way adversely as a result, but on the contrary, as a strong woman who takes what she wants guiltlessly and confidently, because she has related to him on an equal footing from the start? Doesn't she later give him advice in his office, and then reject his offer to marry her and `take care of her' because she has her own life (like any self-respecting feminist would)? And so what if she's seeing Robert Hays (Gere's hunting buddy) on the side? Doesn't that further prove that she's independent enough to keep her options open and reject a conceited `gynecologist' she likes very much but not enough to give up her career or principles for (if it comes down to a marriage offer that she's not ready to accept, as it surely did in the end)?  Doesn't that show foresight and mature independence rather than some `two-timing' `cheating woman' nonsense proving her `typical female treachery,' and `shallowness' when she wasn't romantically committed to Gere yet anyway? I very much think so, and all Altman is doing is 'keeping it real,' and away from audience expectations and cliche, which, naturally makes a lot of people quite annoyed and mad, since their programmed tastes weren't satisfied.",5,Packed DVD!
