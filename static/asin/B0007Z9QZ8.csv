896352,A2Z7OM92A5I71O,B0007Z9QZ8,Angelo,"[0, 0]","This is a cute, innocent Disney movie that, in general, holds up quite well 35 years later.  John Amos is fantastic as the over-eager coach who wants to end his losing streak by recruiting a Tarzan-like natural athlete, named Nanu, from the jungles of Africa.  Roscoe Lee Browne is also great as Nanu's witch doctor godfather.  Jan-Michael Vincent is charming as the athletic young man, even managing to make the obligatory Tarzan dialogue sound innocent rather than dopey.  Of the entire movie, only Tim Conway's ""funny"" scenes didn't make me laugh, which surprised me since I usually like his work.  I think it was because these scenes seemed to be inserted into the movie without any real purpose, and the humour was just slapstick instead of developing from the character.  As a sad commentary on modern athletic competition, what most dates this movie is the lack of steroid-induced muscular development in the college athletes that Nanu is competing against!Recommended to anyone who wants to watch a funny and sweet feel-good movie, suitable for children and adults of all ages.",4,Good clean fun,1210636800,"05 13, 2008",2008,1085,"['cute', 'innocent', 'Disney', 'movie', 'general', 'up', 'quite', 'well', '35', 'years', 'later', 'John', 'Amos', 'fantastic', 'over-eager', 'coach', 'who', 'end', 'losing', 'streak', 'recruiting', 'Tarzan-like', 'natural', 'athlete', 'named', 'Nanu', 'jungles', 'Africa', 'Roscoe', 'Lee', 'Browne', 'also', 'great', 'Nanu', 'witch', 'doctor', 'godfather', 'Jan-Michael', 'Vincent', 'charming', 'athletic', 'young', 'man', 'even', 'managing', 'make', 'obligatory', 'Tarzan', 'dialogue', 'sound', 'innocent', 'rather', 'dopey', 'entire', 'movie', 'only', 'Tim', 'Conway', 'funny', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'surprised', 'usually', 'work', 'think', 'was', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'be', 'inserted', 'movie', 'real', 'purpose', 'humour', 'was', 'just', 'slapstick', 'instead', 'developing', 'character', 'sad', 'commentary', 'modern', 'athletic', 'competition', 'what', 'most', 'dates', 'movie', 'lack', 'steroid-induced', 'muscular', 'development', 'college', 'Nanu', 'competing', 'Recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'watch', 'funny', 'sweet', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'suitable', 'children', 'adults', 'ages']",N/A

A lot of credit has to go to John Amos as Coach Sam Archer.

Jan-Michael Vincent really looked good in this Disney movie. Jan-Michael Vincent could have been a very good star. Too bad things turned bad for him. These were his glory days.

Admittedly there are stupider Disney comedies to come out since, but they don't have the charm and home-grown look and feel of these 59-84 ones.)Anyway, blah blah blah, ""Athlete"" was issued in 1973 and is the first Disney feature to have an African-American star (John Amos) since ""Song of the South""! The writing for this film is inconsistent. There are some genuine laughs, particularly from Tim Conway in his first Disney movie, and even some from announcer Howard Cosell!As far as this DVD goes, I have had no luck finding it in US stores, so the version I received is a Canadian copy. I don't mind as long as it works in my player, which it does. The film itself is a widescreen transfer, which is a good thing, as Disney has sometimes not released their films to DVD in this format. The print quality is excellent and there are even some extras! Although, apart from the original trailer appear to be some random cutting room outtakes that don't have synchonized sound so you don't really know what's going on, and they're not particularly funny, either.Overall, if you are a ""Dopey"" Disney Comedy fan, a Tim Conway fan, or wonder where the hell John Amos went after ""Roots"", check this one out.
