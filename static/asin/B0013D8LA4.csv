1140792,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B0013D8LA4,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[1, 2]","Of Romero's ""Dead"" films, this was my least favorite (Day of the Dead was my favorite). Still, this was a solid effort, with love and care and Romero usually does with his zombie films. While I would have to say Diary of the Dead is inferior to the recent Quarantine, this was still a very entertaining film with the signature gore, lots of zombies, and convoluted political messages.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: What starts out as a project for a horror film about mummies for a group of student filmmakers, ends up becoming a documentary about the takeover the undead and the events of three days. The group is determined to get back home and record the events along the way and cope with loss each day as one by one group members die.MUSIC: Unlike most other cam corder films, this one actually has music. This is a nice touch and something I've been craving from most of these films. It's good overall and sets the mood well.ACTION: As you'd expect, there's plenty of gore to go around and zombie mayhem. While the gore is not as gut-wrenching as the likes of ""Day"" or ""Land's"" it's still nasty and had some very nice special effects. This film never really gets boring, and is interesting throughout. That's the important thing.ACTING: The actors in general were fairly good and convincing (Something that can't be said about most zombie flicks). I didn't like the main character though, he struck me as a douche and was very unlikable. The rest of the cast was enjoyable though.OVERALL: If you like Romero, you'll probably like this. If you hated Land of the Dead, you'll hate this even more. So I'll give this a cautionary rental for a zombie fanatic. I really enjoyed and serves as yet another solid entry in Romero's ""Dead"" franchise.THE GOOD: The actors, the gore, the music, and the action scenes.THE BAD: The storyline isn't too good, some slow moments, and the unlikable main character.",4,"NOT HIS BEST WORK, BUT ROMERO PULLED IT OFF  8.25 OUT OF 10",1245110400,"06 16, 2009",2009,1887,"['Romero', 'Dead', 'films', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'Day', 'Dead', 'was', 'favorite', 'Still', 'was', 'solid', 'effort', 'love', 'care', 'Romero', 'usually', 'zombie', 'films', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'inferior', 'recent', 'Quarantine', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'signature', 'gore', 'lots', 'zombies', 'convoluted', 'political', 'messages.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'What', 'out', 'project', 'horror', 'film', 'mummies', 'group', 'student', 'filmmakers', 'up', 'becoming', 'documentary', 'takeover', 'undead', 'events', 'three', 'days', 'group', 'determined', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'record', 'events', 'way', 'cope', 'loss', 'day', 'one', 'one', 'group', 'members', 'die.MUSIC', 'most', 'other', 'cam', 'corder', 'films', 'one', 'actually', 'music', 'nice', 'touch', 'something', ""'ve"", 'been', 'craving', 'most', 'films', 'good', 'overall', 'mood', 'well.ACTION', ""'d"", 'expect', 'plenty', 'gore', 'go', 'around', 'zombie', 'mayhem', 'gore', 'not', 'as', 'gut-wrenching', 'likes', 'Day', 'Land', 'still', 'nasty', 'had', 'very', 'nice', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'boring', 'interesting', 'important', 'thing.ACTING', 'actors', 'general', 'were', 'fairly', 'good', 'convincing', 'Something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'most', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'did', ""n't"", 'main', 'character', 'struck', 'douche', 'was', 'very', 'unlikable', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'though.OVERALL', 'like', 'Romero', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'hated', 'Land', 'Dead', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'even', 'more', 'So', ""'ll"", 'give', 'cautionary', 'rental', 'zombie', 'fanatic', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'serves', 'yet', 'solid', 'entry', 'Romero', 'Dead', 'franchise.THE', 'GOOD', 'actors', 'gore', 'music', 'action', 'scenes.THE', 'BAD', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'too', 'good', 'slow', 'moments', 'unlikable', 'main', 'character']",N/A
1140793,A19ATJSKDZD9EZ,B0013D8LA4,"Adam Stapleton ""drunken sailor""","[2, 4]","As I get older and more individualistic I begin to realize that many of the movies I once thought were brilliant or underrated, I was in fact judging and looking at through zombie-bite colored glasses.Such is the case with all of Romero's work, especially his last two installments in his zombie genre, Land of the Dead and his latest work Diary of the Dead.I recognize that Land of the Dead wasn't a particularly good movie, but I must have seen it in the theaters at least 3 times nonetheless, I truly enjoyed the movie despite its misguided attempt at satiring President Bush.I've come to realize that much of the ideas and political statements that Romero seeks to make with his films are for the most part juevenile at best.No more so has this been more apparent than in Diary of the Dead (hence forth Diary).I wouldn't call Diary a bad movie, so much as it is a very mediocre one, with little in the way of scares or real substance (the whole video documenting obsession idea has become something of a dated concept that I don't feel really needs to be commented on, or that at least Romero wasn't quite able to pull off what he was going for with it).I think Romero would have been better off making a statement about something a little more relevant to everyone, like the energy crisis, terrorism/war etc. Any of those ideas would have been better than trying to comment on something as boring as video documentation obsession.I also think that the whole idea of watching the movie through the lens of amatuer handhelds, while an interesting concept, wasn't executed to any great effect and really just kind of makes the thing a bore to watch. I think it's almost easier to dissasociate yourself from the film, even more so than it would be if it were shot in the traditional filmmaking manner, for me anyway.At no point while watching Diary did I find myself buying into it or suspending my disbelief, whereas while watching Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake (which I feel is superior to almost all zombie films to date and is responsible for the recent revitalization of the zombie genre and Romero) I became engulfed in the story and action and found myself feeling for the characters and watching on the edge of my seat.No such luck with Diary.The verdict: Diary plays like as a decent b-movie, strives for more but fails terribly.Rent, don't buy.",2,Diary of Romero's decline,1211414400,"05 22, 2008",2008,2363,"['get', 'older', 'more', 'individualistic', 'begin', 'realize', 'many', 'movies', 'once', 'thought', 'were', 'brilliant', 'underrated', 'was', 'fact', 'judging', 'looking', 'zombie-bite', 'colored', 'glasses.Such', 'case', 'Romero', 'work', 'especially', 'last', 'two', 'installments', 'zombie', 'genre', 'Land', 'Dead', 'latest', 'work', 'Diary', 'Dead.I', 'recognize', 'Land', 'Dead', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'good', 'movie', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'theaters', 'least', '3', 'times', 'nonetheless', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'misguided', 'attempt', 'satiring', 'President', 'Bush.I', ""'ve"", 'come', 'realize', 'much', 'ideas', 'political', 'statements', 'Romero', 'make', 'films', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'juevenile', 'best.No', 'more', 'so', 'been', 'more', 'apparent', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'hence', 'forth', 'Diary', '.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'Diary', 'bad', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'very', 'mediocre', 'one', 'little', 'way', 'scares', 'real', 'substance', 'whole', 'video', 'documenting', 'obsession', 'idea', 'become', 'something', 'dated', 'concept', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'really', 'be', 'commented', 'least', 'Romero', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'think', 'Romero', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'making', 'statement', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'relevant', 'everyone', 'energy', 'crisis', 'terrorism/war', 'etc', 'ideas', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'trying', 'comment', 'something', 'as', 'boring', 'video', 'documentation', 'obsession.I', 'also', 'think', 'whole', 'idea', 'watching', 'movie', 'lens', 'amatuer', 'handhelds', 'interesting', 'concept', 'was', ""n't"", 'executed', 'great', 'effect', 'really', 'just', 'kind', 'thing', 'bore', 'watch', 'think', 'almost', 'easier', 'dissasociate', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'were', 'shot', 'traditional', 'filmmaking', 'manner', 'point', 'watching', 'Diary', 'did', 'find', 'buying', 'suspending', 'disbelief', 'whereas', 'watching', 'Zack', 'Snyder', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'remake', 'feel', 'superior', 'almost', 'zombie', 'films', 'date', 'responsible', 'recent', 'revitalization', 'zombie', 'genre', 'Romero', 'became', 'engulfed', 'story', 'action', 'found', 'feeling', 'characters', 'watching', 'edge', 'seat.No', 'such', 'luck', 'Diary.The', 'verdict', 'Diary', 'plays', 'decent', 'b-movie', 'more', 'fails', 'terribly.Rent', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy']",N/A

Johnson ""Jason Hex""","[4, 9]","In this fifth installment of George Romero's zombie saga, he turns his sites on our current cultural pathologies; in this case, it's the society of the spectacle under examination. Romero's acute eye for social satire and his tremendously serious motivations coexist with sterling storytelling ability, some of the finest gore effects in movies today, and a bit of fun too. In other words, Diary of the Dead offers something for everybody, much as Shakespeare, even in his tragedies, always serves up a bit of business with the gravedigger. These days we're more and more apt to be a hybrid audience; we've got a little bit of the groundling in us, a little bit of the highbrow critic. Media has made us what we are, for good or ill, and Romero offers no solutions to our existential crisis. In this film, we're all implicated in one or another kind of living death, even if it's just the ubiquitous passivity of the average YouTube watcher...if we watch and do nothing, we are guilty of the kind of sin even the Pope has no category for, yet. The mall-walking zombies of Dawn of the Dead, dead consumers with an atavistic twitch for product, are now the clickers on hotlinks, the bloggers and blog-readers, the goldfish in the media aquarium (to cite one of the many splendid metaphors in Diary).

1140797,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B0013D8LA4,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[2, 3]","I've never seen a George A. Romero film before this one.  Of course I knew it was to ""different"" from his usual fare, given that it starts with a new zombie thing happening, rather than continuing on with the one established in the previous movie.  Be wary of spoilers.I was surprisingly pleased by the fact that, while obviously presented like a documentary filmed by these bunches of students, the protagonist girl whose name I forgot, in the very beginning, describes everything that they've done, filming what has happened, as well as openly admitting that, for the sake of drama, she has added music to certain portions, and edited together footage from other video cameras and security camera footage.  This gave it a sense of legitimacy even in the face of dramatic musical cues.While the characters fall in to the obvious stereotypes of ""the pretty one"", ""the smart one"", ""the dumb guy"", ""the nerd"", ""the jock"", etcetera, they were believable enough in their actions and dialogue, well acted enough.  It does make sense for the protagonist boy to film everything, but the protagonist girl's heated reaction, from pointing a camera at him and repeating dialogue he'd done earlier, to replicating how she screamed when encountering a zombie for the camera, is believable and sympathetic.There are a few moments which seem rather stupid, not quite believable, such as when the bunch are exiting the hospital, and suddenly a zombie staggers out in front of the camera guy, and bites on the guy in front of him.  I found it disorienting as to how the camera guy did not hear/see/smell/in some way sense that a zombie was following them, and how the zombie just bumped past the cameraguy to bite the guy in front of him, and then even more frustrated that NOBODY BOTHERED TO POUNCE ON THE ZOMBIE except for the nerd, who very DANGEROUSLY fought and killed the zombie with a metal stick they put the IV fluid bag on.  Considering how he kept stabbing the zombie, and the zombie would try to keep moving into it to get closer, I found it unbelievable that no one would do anything to try to help him or stop him from putting himself in such close danger.Encounters like the all-black militia force was rather comical, with the leader almost pleased with his predicament, claiming that they have the power now.  It's not unrealistic, but it was funny, and they were nice, especially compared to the band of militants supposedly National Guard who loot from the protagonists.Going towards the end, the usual stereotypes end up dying off, and the survivors lock themselves in a panic room, with the protagonist girl ending the picture off a clip of video that the protagonist boy last downloaded; a gang of hooligans tying up zombies and using them for target practice.  This leads into probably the only direct attempt by the movie to ask ""Are we worth saving?""This message, given the context of the movie itself, seemingly comes out of nowhere, and is totally abrupt and curious.  And then the movie just ends on that.EDIT:  The Amish guy was real fun.",3,"Fun, but ham-fisted message",1294185600,"01 5, 2011",2011,3051,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'film', 'one', 'course', 'knew', 'was', 'different', 'usual', 'fare', 'given', 'new', 'zombie', 'thing', 'happening', 'rather', 'continuing', 'one', 'established', 'previous', 'movie', 'Be', 'wary', 'spoilers.I', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'pleased', 'fact', 'obviously', 'presented', 'documentary', 'filmed', 'bunches', 'students', 'protagonist', 'girl', 'name', 'forgot', 'very', 'beginning', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'done', 'filming', 'what', 'happened', 'as', 'well', 'openly', 'admitting', 'sake', 'drama', 'added', 'music', 'certain', 'portions', 'edited', 'together', 'footage', 'other', 'video', 'cameras', 'security', 'camera', 'footage', 'gave', 'sense', 'legitimacy', 'even', 'face', 'dramatic', 'musical', 'cues.While', 'characters', 'fall', 'obvious', 'stereotypes', 'pretty', 'one', 'smart', 'one', 'dumb', 'guy', 'nerd', 'jock', 'etcetera', 'were', 'believable', 'enough', 'actions', 'dialogue', 'well', 'acted', 'enough', 'make', 'sense', 'protagonist', 'boy', 'film', 'everything', 'protagonist', 'girl', 'heated', 'reaction', 'pointing', 'camera', 'repeating', 'dialogue', ""'d"", 'done', 'earlier', 'replicating', 'how', 'screamed', 'when', 'encountering', 'zombie', 'camera', 'believable', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'seem', 'rather', 'stupid', 'not', 'quite', 'believable', 'such', 'when', 'bunch', 'are', 'exiting', 'hospital', 'suddenly', 'zombie', 'out', 'front', 'camera', 'guy', 'bites', 'guy', 'front', 'found', 'disorienting', 'how', 'camera', 'guy', 'did', 'not', 'hear/see/smell/in', 'way', 'sense', 'zombie', 'was', 'following', 'how', 'zombie', 'just', 'bumped', 'cameraguy', 'bite', 'guy', 'front', 'then', 'even', 'more', 'frustrated', 'NOBODY', 'BOTHERED', 'TO', 'POUNCE', 'ON', 'THE', 'ZOMBIE', 'nerd', 'who', 'very', 'DANGEROUSLY', 'fought', 'killed', 'zombie', 'metal', 'stick', 'put', 'IV', 'fluid', 'bag', 'Considering', 'how', 'kept', 'stabbing', 'zombie', 'zombie', 'would', 'try', 'keep', 'moving', 'get', 'closer', 'found', 'unbelievable', 'one', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'try', 'help', 'stop', 'putting', 'such', 'close', 'danger.Encounters', 'all-black', 'militia', 'force', 'was', 'rather', 'comical', 'leader', 'almost', 'pleased', 'predicament', 'claiming', 'have', 'power', 'now', 'not', 'unrealistic', 'was', 'funny', 'were', 'nice', 'especially', 'compared', 'band', 'militants', 'supposedly', 'National', 'Guard', 'who', 'loot', 'protagonists.Going', 'end', 'usual', 'stereotypes', 'end', 'up', 'dying', 'off', 'survivors', 'lock', 'panic', 'room', 'protagonist', 'girl', 'ending', 'picture', 'off', 'clip', 'video', 'protagonist', 'boy', 'last', 'downloaded', 'gang', 'hooligans', 'tying', 'up', 'zombies', 'using', 'target', 'practice', 'probably', 'only', 'direct', 'attempt', 'movie', 'ask', 'Are', 'saving', 'message', 'given', 'context', 'movie', 'seemingly', 'nowhere', 'totally', 'abrupt', 'curious', 'then', 'movie', 'just', 'that.EDIT', 'Amish', 'guy', 'was', 'real', 'fun']",N/A

1140799,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B0013D8LA4,Anthony Pittore,"[5, 8]","*** This comment may contain spoilers ***'Diary of the Dead' (2007/8)'Diary of the Dead' is the new beginning to another undead series by Zombie King George A. Romero, a personal film-making hero. Though the film does show some striking similarities to Romero's undead roots, you'll notice plenty of changes that make this film very, very different than anything he's ever done.Though I hate to phrase it like this, Romero has quite obviously 'youthed' up this film. Not only with the implementation of the more personal hand-held camera, but with a cast made up of barely anyone over thirty years old, the only main character of advanced years being the rather hilarious film professor, Maxwell (played by Scott Wentworth. . . a man who could nearly pass for Alan Rickman on a good day).The film has a lot to offer. As far as zombie violence, there's plenty of the standards (jumping on backs, clawing at cars, etc.), but there are also a couple new surprises, and a couple new ways of fighting back you might enjoy. There's gore galore, which, though not very rare in Romero's films. . . steps it up in this one a little bit. But not too much.As far as the positives go, they mostly lie with Romero's film-making. The writing and direction are fantastic. What else is to be expected? However, what really brings me to a level of confusion as to just how good this film was comes from the following:- STORY: I honestly don't know where this film wanted to go. It jumped from location to location nonstop, moving from the opening film shoot to the Winnebago, to a hospital, to houses. It NEVER sat still. Maybe Romero purposely did this just to make it apparent: This is NOT part of the original Dead series. Other than 'Land of the Dead,' most of the films in the series chose one spot and stuck with it: Farmhouse, Monroeville Mall, Military Bunker. To be honest, I don't feel like the film accomplished anything as far as story goes. Sure, I guess that's fine, really, as it is the beginning of the series with at least one sequel already planned for a 2009 release. But, 'Night' was the beginning of the series well and I've never, EVER felt that 'Night of the Living Dead' lacked any kind of resolution. Even with three more films in the series, 'Night' could've stood alone and still been an amazing story with a terrific conclusion, one of the best conclusions in history. But, 'Diary' is different. It quite obviously sets itself up for the sequel, but we got no resolution at all. It's kind of like the end of the second 'Lord of the Rings.'- ACTING: Okay. . . I'll be fair. As the film progressed and got deeper, the acting certainly improved. It seems that Romero knew his one weakness when he killed off the unbelievably bad Gordo (Chris Violette). Sure, I doubt it was planned, but it worked out. With that particular actor around much longer, I most certainly would not have enjoyed myself much.- SOCIAL COMMENTARY: Mr. Romero. . . we get it. Really. I know there are plenty of stupid, stupid people in the world, but we understood all of the social commentary you were throwing at us. From devaluing of life to our obsession with disaster to the lack of credibility of the media. . . you really did not need to throw it in our faces. You did not need to show example after example of everything you wanted to comment on. Even the final shots, though interesting and very well done, were just far too obvious with the commentary.- PREMISE: Let me make it clear. . . I loved the premise. Hand-held cameras, though I doubt will ever be a regular studio gimmick, are great for indie filmmakers. They're a cheap way to substitute visuals for creativity. But, with 'Diary,' I just got so sick and tired of the constant explanation of why they're filming the events. ""I want the people to know,"" ""You can't trust the media,"" BLAH BLAH BLAH. Okay, seriously, LET US WATCH. We know you guys are going to film, you established that. It honestly got to the point where it felt like Romero was apologizing for the whole premise of the film. And it got pretty annoying pretty fast. In addition to that, and this is IMPORTANT: The film tried so damn hard to look and feel like a student film, it actually did LOOK AND FEEL LIKE A STUDENT FILM! Now, this may be confusing, but think about it. . . this is George A. Romero, one of the best filmmakers in horror history. . . and he's making a student film?! His execution was, to be honest, TOO good.- - -Now, don't go thinking I didn't like this movie. I did. The film is chock-full of great zombie violence, gore, interesting visuals, and humour. . . and I'm extremely happy that Romero has returned to his routes of small-budget, personal film-making. Not that I didn't love the bigger budget 'Land of the Dead' (which I did, unlike most), but 'Land' didn't feel like Romero. But, due to the 'student film' feel, this really didn't feel like Romero either. And, as a student of his work, that's very sad for me. The film is better than most zombie films. Really. Unfortunately, it doesn't stand up very well to any of the 'Dead' series at all. And, judging without comparison as always. . .Final verdict: 6.5/10 (and my heart breaks even giving it a score this low. . . but it's right).-AP3-",3,Without comparison,1203292800,"02 18,

Now I must admit that I originally snubbed at the concept because whenever it's executed, the results are almost ALWAYS bad.  I'm talking about the ""film within a film"" concept.  I fully expected the worst possible writing imaginable, but instead... it WAS in fact executed near flawlessly.You see, whenever the writing consists of the main character filming a horror movie and walking around with a home video camera, I usually expect a cheap finish with a ""We got you!  It was all just a movie!  None of this was real, haha!"" finishing touch.  Thank goodness I was wrong!Instead it's about a group of teens/young adults (obviously) who walk/drive through several different areas filming zombies in an attempt to make a movie and put the footage online so people around the world who also happen to be experiencing the outbreak can watch for themselves and know how to respond and defeat the vicious blood-sucking creatures.Some of my favorite segments are the ones where the one female working with the crew returns home to find that her family has turned into zombies, and there was a strange feeling of realism here (despite of course, the fact that zombies are far-fetched and unrealistic).  It's hard to explain the feeling... more like an overwhelming feeling of dread.I can't help but believe this movie was influenced by the Resident Evil video game series.  Zombies in a hospital?  Yup, in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.  Zombies in a barn and the sound of chickens bulking?  Yup, in Resident Evil 4 (granted they weren't considered zombies in that game, but still).  Just a few similarities to the popular video game series is something viewers can expect to encounter.Overall, highly enjoyable.

Besides his enormous influence in the genre, his ability to mix horror and social satire has been remarkable. But this latest offering, while sure to be enjoyed by Romero purists or forgiving zombie fans, feels dated and frankly, Romero or not, behind the times. Using a shaky first-person handy-cam perspective, Diary records the predictable events and endless rambling, poorly-acted dialogue to tell its story. This style can be seen in recent movies like Cloverfield and Blair Witch and you can either deal with it or not; some people actually report getting nauseas when viewing this editing style. The plot points of the story are typical - screaming, running and shooting all punctuated with buckets of blood and gore. The expected Romero social commentary does predictably deal with weighty issues such as racism and class conflict but it's delivered with awful acting by screechy immature would-be students out to record their own real-life horror movie. I don't begrudge the film's low-budget atmosphere as it's practically a hallmark of the genre. That still doesn't make it appealing.

I LOVE seeing them shuffling around, groaning every so often, and chowing down on the feuding denizens of the once-dominant, living world.This movie didn't make me happy.  Romero clearly is trying to go the route of ""Cloverfield"" and ""Blair Witch"" and the result just plain hurts.  The actors aren't the greatest, but they're doing the best they can with the truly clunky dialogue they've been given.  Is George R. taking tips from George Lucas these days!?  The business about the young movie maker got real old real fast.  Scenes in the movie that CLEARLY could NOT have been filmed by either of the cameras are included, and leave one to wonder just what's going on.  MUSIC?! Lame narration at the beginning explains why these sorry errors occur, but it only adds to the clunkiness.The whole story is forced and feels like amateur hour rather than a stark new take on an original idea by THE GUY THAT CAME UP WITH IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!  Has George lost his love of the dead? Is the cynical film professor really representative of him?  Why do none of these characters actually act like real people would in this situation?  His previous movies all made intuitive sense.  This one doesn't.  How do people go from freshly dead to gnarly, sunken-eyed, snaggle-toothed zombies in a matter of seconds?  In his prior movies, the freshly dead looked...well...freshly dead.  Here they ""transform"" in a blink of an eye.  What?!  It seems George is just trying to turn a quick buck on a tired premise (the rise of the living dead) and prefers to not try anything truly new and scary.  Why not set it entirely in a hospital? Plenty of potential zombies already there.Why not set it in an airport that goes on lockdown?How about expanding on the scientific efforts seen in Day of the Dead?There's plenty of material waiting to be explored, but George seems to have lost his love for the genre.The zombies are less than inspiring.  They're not even interesting to look at actually...how can an animated, walking corpse not be interesting you ask?  Well, this movie answers that for you.  I can't believe I'm typing this with my own hands, since I've even found nice things to say about movies like ""Redneck Zombies"" in the past.I saw this before the far superior ""Zombie Diaries"" and would strongly encourage anyone curious about this latest Romero flick to reconsider and instead get a copy of ""Zombie Diaries"" instead.

The basic plot is a group of film students from Pennsylvania and their professor are forced to go on a road trip in a Winnebago to find a safe haven in a world suddenly overrun by zombies.  While the plot sounds similar to the other ""dead"" movies, there's a fundamental shift in the ""isolated and on their own"" paradigm used previously.  Thanks to technology, the students record their experiences and share them on-line with others during their travels.  Unfortunately, their obsessive compulsion to document all their experiences results in instances the students forget that they should be participating in the events unfolding in front of them rather than acting as invisible bystanders.  Romero is big on social commentary in his movies.Now that we've gotten the intellectual stuff out of the way, let's talk about the things most people will watch the movie for.  The zombies get dispatched in a variety of gruesome ways.  There's a lot of dark humor and a couple of references to the original ""dead"" movie (I think one of the radio broadcasts comes from the original movie).

1140808,AKKXYLLFVCHGW,B0013D8LA4,Brian Fuchs,"[2, 2]","My biggest gripe with this movie is that it didn't bring anything new to the table.  As I watched it, I saw the same old Romero zombie cliches.  They were great then, but just don't cut it these days.  There were almost no surprises, because most everything was telegraphed (""All clear, sir.  I don't see anything in he- &lt;growl, growl, chomp, chomp>"").Quarantine, on the other hand, kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.Had Romero cast Diary of the Dead better, I think the film would have been much more palatable.  The professor character was absolutely unnecessary, and the actor chewed the scenes like a zombie Shatner.  At the climax of the movie, when they arrive at the mansion, I was hoping for something new - some twist - but as soon as they were greeted by an over-acting Ridley, the rest of the movie was suddenly laid out.Perhaps the most out-of-place scene in the entire film was when Jason chooses to film Tracy as she is slowly chased by zombie-Ridley.  Not only does Romero choose to make the scene comedic (complete with whimsical score), it makes the viewer wonder how the hell this zombie thing became an epidemic in the first place.  A person can out-walk a zombie in the middle of a forest -- barefoot!  I mean seriously, only in Romero movies can a person pierce a zombie skull with a blunt aluminum pipe.  Does part of becoming a zombie include human bone turning to styrofoam?I hope that Island of the Dead delivers more than this one did.

1140809,AE23DYT0RDFUV,B0013D8LA4,Brian Ridgway,"[6, 7]","Hello, and THANK YOU for reading my reviews. Despite my deep respect for George Romero as a filmmaker, I've waited until this week (over 2 years after it's release!) to see DIARY OF THE DEAD. Mainly it's because I was somewhat disappointed with his last big horror feature LAND OF THE DEAD, but following my recent screening, I have to say that I found DIARY to be an unusual, entertaining feature. Filled with interesting content, reasonably solid dialogue and good characterizations, DIARY is an unusual choice for Romero in that it 'compresses' the zombie world he's created, in effect moving the events of the original NIGHT to relatively current times, as well as placing the followup DAWN OF THE DEAD in a time frame as to suggest that it occurred only weeks ago. Strange as that sounds, Romero makes it work by filling the screen with haunting images of violence, an unsettling tone of despair and a modern pace that compares (and transcends) most contemporary thrillers. Although the film starts out a bit 'stilted', it's relatively easy to fall into line with the pack of survivors he creates here. The actors are all unknown but deliver solid performances. If I had one major complaint with the film though, it's that Romero's decision to shoot on HD video (not only as a budget constraint, but as clearly as part of the in-film story) it's that there are a few TOO MANY scenes where the screen is too dark, losing character detail and confusing the action. HD video seems to be good for relaying vibrant color, but the blacks seem all too FLAT and the lens range doesn't seem to compensate well when going from indoor to outdoor environments. Having said that, I found the film overall probably the most effective ROMERO ZOMBIE entry in terms of maintaining an effectively creepy tone throughout, as well as a terrifically bizarre ending shot that's as shocking and oddly thoughtful as anything he's committed to film. All in all, after TWO viewings, I feel that DIARY has achieved a position directly behind DAWN OF THE DEAD and NIGHT as my THIRD FAVORITE zombie effort.I wasn't crazy about Romero doing another zombie film, but with DIARY, he's shown considerable growth and energy as a filmmaker and cultural commentator.",4,"DIARY a surprisingly fresh, thoughtful and strange entry",1267142400,"02 26, 2010",2010,2235,"['Hello', 'THANK', 'YOU', 'reading', 'reviews', 'deep', 'respect', 'George', 'Romero', 'filmmaker', ""'ve"", 'waited', 'week', '2', 'years', 'release', 'see', 'DIARY', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'Mainly', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'last', 'big', 'horror', 'feature', 'LAND', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'following', 'recent', 'screening', 'have', 'say', 'found', 'DIARY', 'be', 'unusual', 'entertaining', 'feature', 'Filled', 'interesting', 'content', 'reasonably', 'solid', 'dialogue', 'good', 'characterizations', 'DIARY', 'unusual', 'choice', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'world', 'created', 'effect', 'moving', 'events', 'original', 'NIGHT', 'relatively', 'current', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'placing', 'followup', 'DAWN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'time', 'frame', 'suggest', 'occurred', 'only', 'weeks', 'ago', 'Strange', 'Romero', 'work', 'filling', 'screen', 'haunting', 'images', 'violence', 'unsettling', 'tone', 'despair', 'modern', 'pace', 'most', 'contemporary', 'thrillers', 'film', 'out', 'bit', ""'stilted"", 'relatively', 'easy', 'fall', 'line', 'pack', 'survivors', 'here', 'actors', 'are', 'unknown', 'deliver', 'solid', 'performances', 'had', 'one', 'major', 'complaint', 'film', 'Romero', 'decision', 'shoot', 'HD', 'video', 'not', 'only', 'budget', 'constraint', 'as', 'clearly', 'part', 'in-film', 'story', 'are', 'few', 'TOO', 'MANY', 'scenes', 'where', 'screen', 'too', 'dark', 'losing', 'character', 'detail', 'confusing', 'action', 'HD', 'video', 'be', 'good', 'relaying', 'vibrant', 'color', 'blacks', 'seem', 'too', 'FLAT', 'lens', 'range', ""n't"", 'seem', 'compensate', 'well', 'when', 'going', 'indoor', 'outdoor', 'environments', 'Having', 'said', 'found', 'film', 'overall', 'probably', 'most', 'effective', 'ROMERO', 'ZOMBIE', 'entry', 'terms', 'maintaining', 'effectively', 'creepy', 'tone', 'as', 'well', 'terrifically', 'bizarre', 'ending', 'shot', 'shocking', 'oddly', 'thoughtful', 'anything', 'committed', 'film', 'TWO', 'viewings', 'feel', 'DIARY', 'achieved', 'position', 'directly', 'DAWN', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'NIGHT', 'THIRD', 'FAVORITE', 'zombie', 'effort.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'Romero', 'doing', 'zombie', 'film', 'DIARY', 'shown', 'considerable', 'growth', 'energy', 'filmmaker', 'cultural', 'commentator']",N/A

DIARY follows a group of college students as they document their first-hand account of the zombie apocalypse using a hand-held video camera. Unfortunately, Romero gets the format entirely wrong in every conceivable way. Instead of producing an ultra-realistic nightmare as we had seen in [REC] from the same year, he gives us a poorly-staged and utterly contrived zombie bore lead by unbelievable characters and lackluster special effects.In the first of many offenses, Romero allows his characters to edit their footage, which entails adding slow-motion effects, scene transitions, and even narration. The editor has even chosen to emphasize the scares using blaring sound effects! Romero's characters are given painfully unnatural dialog, which makes them come off as being bad actors rather than genuine people. The zombies are killed in a variety of glamorized ways that simply would not happen in a real-world survivor setting. Worst of all, the cartoon gore is comprised almost entirely by computerized effects! How does this, in any way, reflect reality? Why choose this format only to then go back and fictionalize the events? The only answer seems to lie in the editor's commentary, itself. Debra repeatedly stresses how it was impossible to discern fact from fiction with 400,000 spins on the truth available for download online. Perhaps this, too, is some elaborate prank being played by the filmmakers, calling back to the Wellesian War of the Worlds radio drama that Romero references as well? Even in that remote possibility, DIARY OF THE DEAD never displays enough intelligence to credit it as being a satire.DIARY OF THE DEAD shows an extreme disconnect between concept and execution.

1140812,A21VGNU5959O85,B0013D8LA4,CaterpillarGirl,"[7, 10]","First off, I am a huge Romero Fan as well as a fan of the whole zombie genre. I don't claim that the movies I do love (night, dawn, day, land, the remake of dawn, the return of the living dead I and II, Undead, Fido, remake of Night,) are Oscar winning material, although a lot of them are horror lovers fan favorites. Humans getting up from a seemingly long dirt nap, morgue table, or after you run over them aren't usually on your normal wish list for plot points. I have said in reviews past that my love of zombies comes from my fear of the closest thing to you, or the people around you, becoming what you run from in the night, and you cannot reason with them, they want your flesh and they want it raw. Romero above all, has been able to tap into that fear and he is the king of the dead. This movie, as its internal movie within a movie is called is hopefully not the ""death of death"" It was horrible, and not in a campy ""its so bad its good"" way.The premise, college kids making monster movie in woods when the dead come back to life, and so its filmed in that shaky hand held homemade movie way. It worked for Blair Witch, and for Clover field, but not for this. Jason, the man behind the camera, just HAS to document the events; all of a sudden he is beyond mummy movies and thinks he is the next great documentarian. So he gets it into his head that he MUST film at all times, even at the expense of the living people around him, he wont drop that camera because it is now his life's purpose.  The rest of the bunch consists of the rich guy, the blonde chick and her boyfriend, some nerd, a drunken professor, and Jason's girlfriend. Romero has a way of putting people together who represent society, this time it was his version of what kids today are like (and he got it wrong) I think back to Barbara and Ben and Harry in NOTLD (1968) and how amazing that dynamic was, or Stephen and Peter and Roger and Francine in DOTD (1978) those casts are memorable and iconic (also Day, and even in Land and remake of Night and Dawn). It was as if Romero didn't want us to care about this cast, as if they were expendable and forgetful and the Blog/footage was the real star, but that didn't work either.The actors in Romero's films usually, to me anyway, are refreshingly un-affected, they aren't well known and they aren't tainted by what ""they think"" they should be ""acting"" like. It's what makes them all the more real. The ""actors"" in Diary of the Dead reminded me of watching very horrible high school drama skits, or some banal MTV ""reality"" show like The Hills or Laguna Beach. Painfully aware that they are on camera and should be acting a certain way.The effects, my favorite part of zombie movies, were so severely disappointing. Gone were Tom Savini's genius and in its place was weakly executed CGI and makeup. Digital blood is a slap in the face of zombie enthusiasts everywhere. Sure if you want to do a giant shot of the dead (remake of Dawn) go ahead poor some CGI blood up in there, I will even okay it in frenzy, but one on one is unforgivable and lazy.I think that Romero still has things to say, points to make, dead people to reanimate, I just don't think that shooting a movie over 23 days sloppily is the way to do it, and still retain your fan base. I just got burned, me a loyal fan, and the next one I will rent instead of buy.The special features, mainly the contest winners from the Myspace ""make your own zombie movie"" were the ONLY redeeming quality on this DVD. All five were interesting, funny and entertaining.In conclusion, this movie sucked and its my one and only ""get out of undead jail"" free card for george.",1,Bury this one without its Head.,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,3651,"['First', 'am', 'huge', 'Romero', 'Fan', 'as', 'well', 'fan', 'whole', 'zombie', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'claim', 'movies', 'do', 'love', 'night', 'dawn', 'day', 'land', 'remake', 'dawn', 'return', 'living', 'dead', 'II', 'Undead', 'Fido', 'remake', 'Night', 'are', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'material', 'lot', 'are', 'horror', 'lovers', 'fan', 'favorites', 'Humans', 'getting', 'up', 'seemingly', 'long', 'dirt', 'nap', 'morgue', 'table', 'run', 'are', ""n't"", 'usually', 'normal', 'wish', 'list', 'plot', 'points', 'have', 'said', 'reviews', 'love', 'zombies', 'fear', 'closest', 'thing', 'people', 'becoming', 'what', 'run', 'night', 'can', 'not', 'reason', 'want', 'flesh', 'want', 'raw', 'Romero', 'been', 'able', 'tap', 'fear', 'king', 'dead', 'movie', 'internal', 'movie', 'movie', 'called', 'hopefully', 'not', 'death', 'death', 'was', 'horrible', 'not', 'campy', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'way.The', 'premise', 'college', 'kids', 'making', 'monster', 'movie', 'woods', 'when', 'dead', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'so', 'filmed', 'shaky', 'hand', 'held', 'homemade', 'movie', 'way', 'worked', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Clover', 'field', 'not', 'Jason', 'man', 'camera', 'just', 'HAS', 'document', 'events', 'sudden', 'mummy', 'movies', 'thinks', 'next', 'great', 'documentarian', 'head', 'MUST', 'film', 'times', 'even', 'expense', 'living', 'people', 'wont', 'drop', 'camera', 'now', 'life', 'purpose', 'rest', 'bunch', 'rich', 'guy', 'blonde', 'chick', 'boyfriend', 'nerd', 'drunken', 'professor', 'Jason', 'girlfriend', 'Romero', 'way', 'putting', 'people', 'together', 'who', 'represent', 'society', 'time', 'was', 'version', 'what', 'kids', 'today', 'are', 'got', 'wrong', 'think', 'back', 'Barbara', 'Ben', 'Harry', 'NOTLD', '1968', 'how', 'amazing', 'dynamic', 'was', 'Stephen', 'Peter', 'Roger', 'Francine', 'DOTD', '1978', 'casts', 'are', 'memorable', 'iconic', 'also', 'Day', 'even', 'Land', 'remake', 'Night', 'Dawn', 'was', 'Romero', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'care', 'cast', 'were', 'expendable', 'forgetful', 'Blog/footage', 'was', 'real', 'star', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'either.The', 'actors', 'Romero', 'films', 'usually', 'anyway', 'are', 'refreshingly', 'un-affected', 'are', ""n't"", 'well', 'known', 'are', ""n't"", 'tainted', 'what', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'acting', 'what', 'more', 'real', 'actors', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'reminded', 'watching', 'very', 'horrible', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'skits', 'banal', 'MTV', 'reality', 'show', 'Hills', 'Laguna', 'Beach', 'Painfully', 'aware', 'are', 'camera', 'should', 'be', 'acting', 'certain', 'way.The', 'effects', 'favorite', 'part', 'zombie', 'movies', 'were', 'so', 'severely', 'disappointing', 'Gone', 'were', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'genius', 'place', 'was', 'weakly', 'executed', 'CGI', 'makeup', 'Digital', 'blood', 'slap', 'face', 'zombie', 'enthusiasts', 'everywhere', 'Sure', 'want', 'do', 'giant', 'shot', 'dead', 'remake', 'Dawn', 'go', 'ahead', 'poor', 'CGI', 'blood', 'up', 'there', 'will', 'even', 'okay', 'frenzy', 'one', 'one', 'unforgivable', 'lazy.I', 'think', 'Romero', 'still', 'things', 'say', 'points', 'make', 'dead', 'people', 'reanimate', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'shooting', 'movie', '23', 'days', 'sloppily', 'way', 'do', 'still', 'retain', 'fan', 'base', 'just', 'got', 'burned', 'loyal', 'fan', 'next', 'one', 'will', 'rent', 'instead', 'buy.The', 'special', 'features', 'mainly', 'contest', 'winners', 'Myspace', 'make', 'own', 'zombie', 'movie', 'were', 'ONLY', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'DVD', 'five', 'were', 'interesting', 'funny', 'entertaining.In', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'sucked', 'one', 'only', 'get', 'undead', 'jail', 'free', 'card', 'george']",N/A
1140813,A6DOCZ10B7JAJ,B0013D8LA4,"C. Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[17, 21]","Good evening.  This is Tom with Channel 4 news.  The stock market crashed as oil prices hit record highs.  The unemployment rate ballooned nearly 10% the past month while crime keeps escalating at an alarming rate.  Home equity plummetted, health care plans are becoming invalid, taxes rose, debt skyrocketed, and the soldier's death toll suffers its most jagged increase since the opening weeks of the war.  But to heck with all that irrelevant junk, did you watch American Idol last night?  Hahaha, that's some funny stuff!My biggest problem with the latest Dead installment is the seesaw effect between the serious and the comical.  Throw in so much cheese and corn, and it's hard to digest all of the social and political commentary.  George makes some great points, some important profound statements, and then shows something totally absurd to spoil the moment.  I didn't particularly care for that.I've got some more issues with this one.  The acting is pretty bad, but that didn't really bother me.  Neither did the CGI.  I hated the tone, or the mood of this entire story.  George never really establishes a dark, gloomy, foreboding atmosphere.  In my opinion, an adequate feel of desperation never settles in, I'm sorry to say.I did love the idea of the homemade zombie documentary.  Romero tries to bring a  fresh element to the horror genre, and for that he should be commended.  But the camera work was not too convincing.  It rarely has a real feel.  And I was shocked at how underdeveloped the characters are.  Maybe this story is about people as a whole, but some closer connection with some individuals would have been nice.Diary of the Dead starts strong, but quickly fizzles out in many aspects.  There are some nice gore scenes, although it seemed to be lacking in that department a bit.  It has some undeniably great pieces from the master, but are bogged down by chunks of disaster.  I will say that I'm impressed with Romero's efforts at something original in the zombie saga.

1140814,A3A4X31CJLIZMS,B0013D8LA4,"C. Dunn ""THE Bart""","[2, 5]","Everyone seems to be leaning toward the ""it was okay"" review. However, this is a masterpiece. I love the social commentary that Romero is pounding into everyone's head. It's great and it is VERY much needed in a day and age where everyone does nothing but film mayhem and never does anything to help someone who is in dire straits. I am guessing people are afraid of this film because it truly shows how much of a society of dumb-dumbs we are. Cell phone users are included.This in my opinion is Romero's best film since 1985's ""Day Of The Dead"".Much much much better than ""Land Of The Dead"".

Call,"[0, 2]","As with Day of the Dead, Diary puts a very strong emphasis on the characters, and less on action, with great results.The great thing about Romeros Dead movies is that no two are alike. This one is from the perspective of film students making a documentary of their experiences during the first outbreak. The premise allows for unique camera angles, and Romero's directing talent shows throughout. Shaky footage, shots from the floor, documentary style interviews, and even small details like the camera running out of batteries are used. There's nothing flashy or hollywood about this. The characters are developed wonderfully instead of reel after reel of mindless zombie blasting. This is a horror movie as it should be. The dialogue is smart, giving each character, even ones that make only brief appearances the human element. They are each dealing with the crisis in their own way, and portrayed for example in scenes where the camera man is so tied to his camera that he would do nothing to save his friends because it would ruin the shot. Breif clips that were 'downloaded' by the students (made by others experiences of the crisis) and incorporated into the film are vividly created to an eerie level. They also give Romero the chance to make more observations about how we deal with the threat of danger.This is intelligent, A grade horror, and though all 5 dead movies are great, this and 'Day' stand as my favorite of the first 5 for their special attention to the characters rather than action.

1140817,A1DBQOB2CVLDOS,B0013D8LA4,"Chris Van Deelen ""Chris Van Deelen""","[1, 3]","Diary of the Dead is the fifth instalment of George A. Romero's zombie legacy.We all know how it started, way back in the late 60's with his - at the time - extremely controversial movie, Night of the Living Dead.From that horror classic, his legend grew. Some people think that with each instalment, his movies got worse, some feel the opposite.Me, I'm simply a fan.I've never been a huge fan of horror, with only a couple of notable exceptions. I'm even less a fan of gore. I guess it's the fact that I'm just getting old, and with modern technology, making gore seem more realistic, and thus, horrific, I just can't stomach it any more.The nice thing about Diary of the Dead, is that the gore isn't over the top. It is there, believe me, but it's nothing that I haven't seen before on regular television.No, I'm not kidding. I've seen worse on some medical shows.Is Diary yet another social commentary or is it just a film made for fun? Personally, I believe it's a bit of a commentary on just how accessible information is today, with more and more computers being accessed not only in North America, but globally.I believe that it is also a commentary on how the media takes news and puts its own spin on things, hiding the truth, changing the truth.Can, by the media changing what it films, cost lives?I think that is the basic message behind the movie - that and for pure entertainment value of course.And the answer is yes. If the media changes things, puts its own spin on a story, vital information could be twisted or changed, or left out completely.Thus, misinformation could very well cost lives.A call for the media to change its way. And a bit of an invitation for armatures to continue to film what they see and post it online for others to see. That is until the government or others who control the media get to it and force it off the web.Right now, I wonder what a person such as myself might be able to find on the whole earthquake in China, or that Typhoon that wiped out so many lives in Miramar.Makes one think, doesn't it?Also, it deals with obsession, in this case, one that is to the point it could be considered an insanity. With what happened in the movie, it's not a big surprise, really.Anyhow, enough of my own social commentary.The movie was wonderfully done! It had the feel of a amateurish production, being shot through handheld cameras, but at least it didn't make me motion sick to watch, like a movie I enjoyed earlier this year called Cloverfield.And, the movie takes place right at the beginning... right as the rising began. Even the first shot of the dead rising being caught on film. It was pretty intense to watch, despite the fact that I knew what to expect.Of course it also showed how quickly civilization could crumble under something totally unexpected, and where the media has been twisted to the point that nothing but misinformation is getting out.Thus costing lives that could have otherwise been saved.As with any major disaster, the other thing that I really enjoyed about the movie was how it brought out not only the worst in people, but the best.You'll see what I mean with a gang, and with the military.For myself and my wife, the movie wasn't scary. Intense, oh, yes... but scary? Nah, I've seen far worse. My son - well, he's only thirteen and he was a little scared watching it, but again, he's seen worse and it hasn't bothered him.Hell, some of the gore in Shaun of the Dead was worse than what was depicted in this movie!Ok, now for the special features. You have the required commentary with writer / director George A. Romero, director of photography Adam Swica, and editor Michael Doherty. There is also a very long feature called For the Record, a documentary on the film's cast, crew and creation.There is a featurette called The Roots, which is the inspiration for the movie, The First Week, which is a visit on the set, Familiar voices, out-takes with the various people who had cameos, and Character Confessions.Finally, there were 5 short zombie films from a contest held on my space.A really excellent film, one of the more enjoyable DVD's I've watched in a long time. I just wish it would have gotten wider release earlier this year.4.5 out of 5",4,"The rising begins, as does the terror...",1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,4222,"['Diary', 'Dead', 'fifth', 'instalment', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'know', 'how', 'started', 'way', 'back', 'late', '60', 'time', 'extremely', 'controversial', 'movie', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead.From', 'horror', 'classic', 'legend', 'grew', 'people', 'think', 'instalment', 'movies', 'got', 'worse', 'feel', 'opposite.Me', ""'m"", 'simply', 'fan.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'horror', 'only', 'couple', 'notable', 'exceptions', ""'m"", 'even', 'less', 'fan', 'gore', 'guess', 'fact', ""'m"", 'just', 'getting', 'old', 'modern', 'technology', 'making', 'gore', 'seem', 'more', 'realistic', 'thus', 'horrific', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stomach', 'more.The', 'nice', 'thing', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'gore', ""n't"", 'top', 'there', 'believe', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'regular', 'television.No', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'medical', 'shows.Is', 'Diary', 'yet', 'social', 'commentary', 'just', 'film', 'made', 'fun', 'Personally', 'believe', 'bit', 'commentary', 'just', 'how', 'accessible', 'information', 'today', 'more', 'more', 'computers', 'being', 'accessed', 'not', 'only', 'North', 'America', 'globally.I', 'believe', 'also', 'commentary', 'how', 'media', 'news', 'own', 'spin', 'things', 'hiding', 'truth', 'changing', 'truth.Can', 'media', 'changing', 'what', 'films', 'cost', 'lives', 'think', 'basic', 'message', 'movie', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'value', 'course.And', 'answer', 'yes', 'media', 'changes', 'things', 'own', 'spin', 'story', 'vital', 'information', 'could', 'be', 'twisted', 'changed', 'left', 'out', 'completely.Thus', 'misinformation', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'cost', 'lives.A', 'call', 'media', 'change', 'way', 'bit', 'invitation', 'armatures', 'continue', 'film', 'what', 'see', 'post', 'others', 'see', 'government', 'others', 'who', 'control', 'media', 'get', 'force', 'off', 'web.Right', 'now', 'wonder', 'what', 'person', 'such', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'whole', 'earthquake', 'China', 'Typhoon', 'wiped', 'out', 'so', 'many', 'lives', 'Miramar.Makes', 'one', 'think', ""n't"", 'Also', 'obsession', 'case', 'one', 'point', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'insanity', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'not', 'big', 'surprise', 'really.Anyhow', 'enough', 'own', 'social', 'commentary.The', 'movie', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'done', 'had', 'feel', 'amateurish', 'production', 'being', 'shot', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'motion', 'sick', 'watch', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'earlier', 'year', 'called', 'Cloverfield.And', 'movie', 'place', 'right', 'beginning', 'right', 'rising', 'began', 'Even', 'first', 'shot', 'dead', 'rising', 'being', 'caught', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'intense', 'watch', 'fact', 'knew', 'what', 'expect.Of', 'course', 'also', 'showed', 'how', 'quickly', 'civilization', 'could', 'crumble', 'something', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'where', 'media', 'been', 'twisted', 'point', 'nothing', 'misinformation', 'getting', 'out.Thus', 'costing', 'lives', 'could', 'have', 'otherwise', 'been', 'saved.As', 'major', 'disaster', 'other', 'thing', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'brought', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'worst', 'people', 'best.You', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'gang', 'military.For', 'myself', 'wife', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'scary', 'Intense', 'oh', 'yes', 'scary', 'Nah', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'far', 'worse', 'son', 'well', 'only', 'thirteen', 'was', 'little', 'scared', 'watching', 'again', 'seen', 'worse', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'him.Hell', 'gore', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'was', 'worse', 'what', 'was', 'depicted', 'movie', 'Ok', 'now', 'special', 'features', 'have', 'required', 'commentary', 'writer', '/', 'director', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'director', 'photography', 'Adam', 'Swica', 'editor', 'Michael', 'Doherty', 'also', 'very', 'long', 'feature', 'called', 'Record', 'documentary', 'film', 'cast', 'crew', 'creation.There', 'featurette', 'called', 'Roots', 'inspiration', 'movie', 'First', 'Week', 'visit', 'set', 'Familiar', 'voices', 'out-takes', 'various', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'cameos', 'Character', 'Confessions.Finally', 'were', '5', 'short', 'zombie', 'films', 'contest', 'held', 'space.A', 'really', 'excellent', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'long', 'time', 'just', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'wider', 'release', 'earlier', '5']",N/A

A group of college students are out making a horror movie when they receive the first news of the dead returning to life.  The movie then documents the students as they desperately try and make it back to their families while trying not to become the next Hot Plate Special.It's hard for me to pin point what I liked best about the movie but if I had to it would be that Romero wisely avoided any big names.  Seeing guys like Simon Baker, Asia Argento, John Lequizamo, and Dennis Hopper just took me out of the story Land of the Dead was trying to tell and reminded me that I was watching a big budget Hollywood movie.  The smaller budget allows for better character development and can play by its own rules.  And with a no name cast, we don't automatically know which star will live to see the end credits. There were some parts where I wanted the characters to drop the cameras and either run or help one of their numbers being attacked, the movie flowed at a quick pace with very little gore that doesn't get too over-the-top.While it doesn't add anything new to the overworked Zombie genre, Diary of the Dead does make for a good late night movie or one for parties and gatherings.

This time around, Romero's taken the novel approach of working with the basic premise of 'Night of the Living Dead' and remixes it within our You Tube-happy pop culture. I was very surprised to see such a fresh, contemporary take on the Living Dead coming from one of modern horror's Old Guard.This is a horror movie that gets better as it progresses. At first, I didn't like it much at all. But within 20 minutes, I did. I appreciate that Romero's largely unknown cast of actors play clever and plausible characters (unlike the way most horror movies portray college students as mindless morons). The satire and social satire are heavy-handed at times, but that's part of what you're buying into when you see a Romero zombie film (and its something missing in most horror films). The gore effects are exceptionally well done, and the film nicely captures the look and feel of 'amateur' video that ends up on the web. There aren't a lot of sudden shocks in this movie; instead there is a growing feeling of despair and dread. By the time the film was over, I felt exceptionally uneasy - which is exactly the way that Romero wants us to feel after his movies.This isn't my favorite 'Dead' movie - but each Dead movie is a different beast from the others.

1140825,A1N1H9FB2LKVI3,B0013D8LA4,DarthJustice,"[0, 0]","Diary of the Dead is the fifth entry in George Romero's famous ""of the Dead"" series. As opposed to Diary's predecessor Land, Romero takes us back to the very beginning of the zombie apocalypse. Taking place at the same time as Night of the Living Dead, a group of college students and their professor are out in the middle of no where filming a student film when the dead start waking up and attacking the living.Unlike the prior ""Dead"" films, Diary doesn't keep our characters in a single location barricaded up but instead must survive driving across Pennsylvania in a Winnibago trying make it to safety somewhere while one character insists on filming the whole thing for a documentary.Truth be told, between Land and Diary (I am still waiting for Survival to come in the mail so I can watch it for the first time), I'm one of the people who actually prefers Diary and enjoyed it more than Land. I enjoyed the atmosphere going on where it was like ""What's happening and what do we do?!"" and sense of urgency that I felt was missing from Land.Unlike what the Amazon description states, this blu-ray does in fact have special features. These are commentary for the movie, character confessionals where  four of the main characters sit in front of the camera (in the bathroom?) of the Winnebago (mostly ranting and raving about nothing in particular) while throwing out little tidbits of their lives, a behind the scenes documentary set during the first week of filming, and a VERY short interview with George Romero.Granted I haven't watched the commentary yet, but truthfully I don't think rest of the special features are anything to write home about. They might could have tried slightly better with the interview with George Romero and the ""first week"" behind-the-scenes documentary. As for the confessionals, they were okay too. Mostly it was the characters sitting there screaming at the camera though each character ""interviewed"" (Deb, Tony, Eliot, and Tracey) dropped a few pieces of information about their lives prior to the outbreak or what they were planning to do in the near future.Like Eliot tells us that not long after they were to finish shooting the film, he was to be going on a blind date. He muses it might have been nothing or something meaningful might have come out of it. I kind of wish the others did something similar, though Tracey mentioned wanting to be an actress..

1140826,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B0013D8LA4,Dave. K,"[3, 4]","I never thought I'd see the day when I wrote a negative review of a George Romero zombie movie, but that day I never thought I'd see has come. Diary of the Dead easily rates as the biggest cinematic letdown for me. Upon hearing Romero was doing another Dead flick I was quite excited. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but I was expecting an enjoyable movie, but what I got was mostly poor with some good moments.George Romero made his feature debut in 1968 with Night of the Living Dead and when Diary of the Dead got it's theatrical release it's almost 40-years since his debut; so right there you can't expect Romero to be the filmmaker he was in his prime, but the problem is with Diary of the Dead he's not even half the filmmaker he once was. A lot of people felt Land of the Dead was a letdown and while I can't say I disagree at the end of the day Land of the Dead was alright and I suppose that was the problem. Romero was a filmmaker who reached a level of greatness most filmmakers can only dream of having and with Land of the Dead he was just hanging onto that; Diary of the Dead is by a filmmaker far past his prime.The one thing I always loved about Romero's movies was his characters; he's an excellent writer who created such great characters with so much depth. The screenplay for Diary of the Dead was simply poor. The characters were terrible! They were rather annoying with no depth at all. Diary of the Dead is one the type of movie that you'll be hard pressed to remember the names of any of the characters and that's never a good thing.Debra played by Michelle Morgan was the only character that was fairly decent, but she's mostly just poorly written for and lacks any depth that it's hard to feel anything for her.The concept for Diary of the Dead is nothing short of brilliant, but the execution was way off. The comedic elements don't work at all there's nothing really funny about them. The only part I found funny is when one character is explaining why the dead don't run. Besides that the comedy was very weak. George Romero is one of my favorite writers, but Diary of the Dead was just lacking I felt the screenplay was poor with very little good about it.As director George Romero doesn't fair any better; The first 3 Dead movies has such amazing suspense and tension and always had this feel of dread and even despite the flaws Land of the Dead also featured some of that even if not as solid. But here there was no suspense or tension and the feel of dread was never around. Diary of the Dead really could have been made by any DTV filmmaker. Besides the social commentary there really isn't anything Romero about this movie; I don't know maybe it's me, but Diary of the Dead feels like a movie by a guy who's seen Night of the Living Dead one too many times.Quite honestly there were a lot of moments that borderline on poor filmmaking. Several scenes are meant to be a little campy, but there's almost this feel of unintentional comedy at times. And even if some of these moments were meant to be light it doesn't work and comes out rather poor.The acting takes a lot of heat, but while the acting was weak it's not as bad as it's made out to be. But it does hurt the film in some spots. At times it's a bit hard too take anything too serious since the actors while not terrible, but just aren't strong enough to pull off the more dramatic moments.What I did however like about Diary of the Dead is the documentary like feel it has going for it. That's why I said earlier the concept was nothing short of brilliant, but the execution was just way off. I might be a little too harsh on Diary of the Dead, but I expected a lot more from George Romero. Maybe in time I'll grow to like this movie, but as of now I can easily say this is my least favorite of all of Romero's Dead movies.In closing, Diary of the Dead isn't terrible despite my review, but it's really not very good at all. Again maybe in time I'll grow to like it, but upon my first viewing while there were some good moments they are few and far between.",2,Major letdown,1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,4054,"['never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'see', 'day', 'when', 'wrote', 'negative', 'review', 'George', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'movie', 'day', 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'see', 'come', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'easily', 'rates', 'biggest', 'cinematic', 'letdown', 'hearing', 'Romero', 'was', 'doing', 'Dead', 'flick', 'was', 'quite', 'excited', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'expecting', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'mostly', 'poor', 'good', 'moments.George', 'Romero', 'made', 'feature', 'debut', '1968', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'when', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'got', 'theatrical', 'release', 'almost', '40-years', 'debut', 'so', 'right', 'ca', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Romero', 'be', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'prime', 'problem', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'not', 'even', 'filmmaker', 'once', 'was', 'lot', 'people', 'felt', 'Land', 'Dead', 'was', 'letdown', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'disagree', 'end', 'day', 'Land', 'Dead', 'was', 'alright', 'suppose', 'was', 'problem', 'Romero', 'was', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'reached', 'level', 'greatness', 'most', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'having', 'Land', 'Dead', 'was', 'just', 'hanging', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'filmmaker', 'far', 'prime.The', 'one', 'thing', 'always', 'loved', 'Romero', 'movies', 'was', 'characters', 'excellent', 'writer', 'who', 'created', 'such', 'great', 'characters', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'screenplay', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'was', 'simply', 'poor', 'characters', 'were', 'terrible', 'were', 'rather', 'annoying', 'depth', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'one', 'type', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'remember', 'names', 'characters', 'never', 'good', 'thing.Debra', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Morgan', 'was', 'only', 'character', 'was', 'fairly', 'decent', 'mostly', 'just', 'poorly', 'written', 'depth', 'hard', 'feel', 'anything', 'her.The', 'concept', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'execution', 'was', 'way', 'comedic', 'elements', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'nothing', 'really', 'funny', 'only', 'part', 'found', 'funny', 'when', 'one', 'character', 'explaining', 'why', 'dead', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'comedy', 'was', 'very', 'weak', 'George', 'Romero', 'one', 'favorite', 'writers', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'was', 'just', 'lacking', 'felt', 'screenplay', 'was', 'poor', 'very', 'little', 'good', 'it.As', 'director', 'George', 'Romero', ""n't"", 'fair', 'better', 'first', '3', 'Dead', 'movies', 'such', 'amazing', 'suspense', 'tension', 'always', 'had', 'feel', 'dread', 'even', 'flaws', 'Land', 'Dead', 'also', 'featured', 'even', 'not', 'solid', 'here', 'was', 'suspense', 'tension', 'feel', 'dread', 'was', 'never', 'around', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'DTV', 'filmmaker', 'social', 'commentary', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'Romero', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'maybe', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'feels', 'movie', 'guy', 'who', 'seen', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times.Quite', 'honestly', 'were', 'lot', 'moments', 'borderline', 'poor', 'filmmaking', 'Several', 'scenes', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'little', 'campy', 'almost', 'feel', 'unintentional', 'comedy', 'times', 'even', 'moments', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'light', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'rather', 'poor.The', 'acting', 'lot', 'heat', 'acting', 'was', 'weak', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'hurt', 'film', 'spots', 'times', 'bit', 'hard', 'too', 'take', 'anything', 'too', 'serious', 'actors', 'not', 'terrible', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'pull', 'off', 'more', 'dramatic', 'moments.What', 'did', 'however', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'documentary', 'feel', 'going', 'why', 'said', 'earlier', 'concept', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'brilliant', 'execution', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'harsh', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'expected', 'lot', 'more', 'George', 'Romero', 'Maybe', 'time', ""'ll"", 'grow', 'like', 'movie', 'now', 'can', 'easily', 'say', 'least', 'favorite', 'Romero', 'Dead', 'movies.In', 'closing', 'Diary', 'Dead', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'review', 'really', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Again', 'maybe', 'time', ""'ll"", 'grow', 'like', 'first', 'viewing', 'were', 'good', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far']",N/A

Romero does try to show the influence of YouTube on his zombie-verse, but it just falls flat.As students are shooting a horror film for a class project, the zombie outbreak begins. The students, and their professor, pile into an RV and set out for their respective homes, or somewhere safe from the undead attack. Typical of Romero's later films, there is lots of arguing, specifically about whether Jason should continue to film their journey. They run into some more people here and there and argue some more with them, then get back on the road and continue arguing with each other. Along the way they run into zombies who manage to eat some of the students now and again.This is a blah film, that tries way too hard to deliver it's message about society's over-exposure through social media. It should be an easy message to tell, but for some reason Romero just doesn't deliver. There is no one to like, so as the character's continue to die off, you don't really care. There is only one scene at an Amish farm that manages to build some tension, but it just feels wedged into the film as an excuse to remind us that there are zombies in the movie.Weak film, and I almost wish Romero would quit mucking around in his own series as nothing he's put out in the last couple of decades can even come close to the first two films in this series.",2,Should've Been So Much Better,1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,1660,"['day', 'age', 'when', 'everyone', 'walking', 'around', 'camera', 'phone', 'instant', 'access', 'world', 'internet', 'craze', 'over-share', 'even', 'smallest', 'details', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'social', 'media', 'really', 'wish', '34', 'Diary', 'Dead', '34', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'commentary', 'narcissistic', 'world', 'Romero', 'try', 'show', 'influence', 'YouTube', 'zombie-verse', 'just', 'flat.As', 'students', 'are', 'shooting', 'horror', 'film', 'class', 'project', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'students', 'professor', 'pile', 'RV', 'set', 'out', 'respective', 'homes', 'somewhere', 'safe', 'undead', 'attack', 'Typical', 'Romero', 'later', 'films', 'lots', 'arguing', 'specifically', 'Jason', 'should', 'continue', 'film', 'journey', 'run', 'more', 'people', 'here', 'there', 'argue', 'more', 'then', 'get', 'back', 'road', 'continue', 'arguing', 'other', 'way', 'run', 'zombies', 'who', 'manage', 'eat', 'students', 'now', 'again.This', 'blah', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'hard', 'deliver', 'message', 'society', 'over-exposure', 'social', 'media', 'should', 'be', 'easy', 'message', 'tell', 'reason', 'Romero', 'just', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'one', 'like', 'so', 'character', 'continue', 'die', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'Amish', 'farm', 'build', 'tension', 'just', 'feels', 'wedged', 'film', 'excuse', 'remind', 'are', 'zombies', 'movie.Weak', 'film', 'almost', 'wish', 'Romero', 'would', 'quit', 'mucking', 'around', 'own', 'series', 'nothing', 'put', 'out', 'last', 'couple', 'decades', 'can', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'series']",N/A

The acting was great a very realistic which added alot to the premise of this latest outing.  This new chapter in the Romero Dead series truly adds to what makes the series great.  The plot is very interesting and edge of your seat, you never know what will happen or where a zombie is going to show up.  The feel of this film is like you are one of the on the run misguided members of this ill fated group, which is what makes the film so effective.  The atmosphere like all Romero zombie films is truly amazing, the over the top gore effects are all present and well done add even more realism to the film.

Too simplistic, I should think, for the average American graduate of high school (or  some higher level of education), to take seriously, stated in that unqualified manner. At any rate, I dismissed any message I could make out as an unnecessary appendage to the film.The film,  itself, I enjoyed as a low key follow up to his earlier ones, giving a somewhat different perspective than he presented in those.

I have never seen this gimmick used in a way that ever made sense and this movie (Diary of the Dead) is no exception.  It's an artifice that doesn't work.  (One of the characters in this movie repeatedly points out just why it doesn't work.  Did anyone listen to her?  No.  Because apparently people will put up with someone shoving a camera in their face....even while they're driving!)Then too, the premise of a movie within a movie is a tired gambit made even worse when the director yells cut but the sap behind the camera keeps filming.  Why?  I can't begin to recall the number of times someone told him to turn off the camera.  Despite his claim to document all this, THIS hadn't happened at that point so the only conclusion is that he is a total narcissist.  It was never about keeping a record.  It was about him playing cameraman.  Something he really wasn't that good at as he jerks from one character to the next (while also managing the feat of walking without stumbling with a camera permanently fixed to his face).  I kept thinking how does he keep his arms up in that position for hours on end; doesn't he ever tire from holding his camera up?  And wouldn't a normal person find it just a little disconcerting having everything they do filmed?  How do you talk to someone who's not a face, he's a camera?  It's inherently a creepy idea.  It's even more ridiculous when they pause to give into a rant about video cameras and the loss of privacy!  Not to mention this gimmick is also repetitive (how many times can you put up with some idiot prompting you to speak into the camera and explain what's going on!?).I'm the first to admit I can't get past the way this movie was presented to deal with it on just a story level.  I might have liked it had it been shot like every other zombie movie Romero has ever made.  As it is, I've seen it twice and considered that two times too many.

1140838,A2BQBLCKJHP65G,B0013D8LA4,"Eric Ericson ""RedSabbath""","[1, 3]","When it comes to the genre/films of Zombies and the Undead, especially the works of it's biggest creator George A. Romero, I am one of it's biggest fans. It takes alot for me to dislike the barrage of films we've received since it's official conception over 40 years ago with Night Of The Living Dead. But after four films by Romero himself, one being the somewhat disappointing & commercial Land Of The Dead, does a now 66 year old George still have what it takes to scare us with these creatures? With his latest chapter Diary Of The Dead, he still proves he can be relevant while bringing us some old time scares at the same time.Diary basically is a reboot of his franchise bringing it back to the first outbreak of the dead rising from their graves. But this time their coming back in the digital age, where now any Joe Schmo could video record the events and post them on a variety of websites for the whole world to see rather than just the local news. The film concentrates on a group of Pittsburgh film students shooting a Mummy monster movie when the initial outbreak begins, and in their Winnebago they try to travel back to their homes and safety. All along the way, they turn their movie into a documentary trying to capture, obsessively mind you, the events of Horror and Death they encounter every time, using the logic of ""If the camera doesn't see it, it really didn't happen"".Unlike other films in Romero's Dead library, this one is in an ""edited after the fact"" documentary style, but unlike last year's Cloverfield, instead of a small handheld camera bought at any electronic store, the main camera used is the type you'd notice carried by your local news team, so the picture it produces wouldn't be as shaky and uncontrolled. And much like The Blair Witch Project, what you see has already been edited, so it's more like a movie made from raw footage instead of just plopping in the original tape in a player and pressing play. For the film it works quite well, but unfortunately it leaves open other problems of logic along the way.On the negative side, the unknown actors used here act about as stiff as the Zombies they're recording. Even though this is supposed to be really happening, at times they just don't seem believable in their emotions & reactions. Another is the fact that at times the girlfriend of the group narrates the documentary but mostly comes across like she's the little sister of Sarah Connor, flat and unaffected. Also, if a Zombie was coming after you I personally would be too afraid to just keep rolling and hope someone else comes to save me instead of putting the damn thing down and running like Hell. But again, these kids are from the ""You Tube"" generation, where hobby becomes life itself, and that should be taken into consideration when watching this film.On the plus side however, there are deaths here that I can assure you that you haven't seen before, the acting does either get better (or you just get used to it), the overall vibe of the film takes on a '85 Day Of The Dead-like quality, and unlike Land Of The Dead never seems too commercialized or sterile. I'm giving this movie a low 8.0, and that's in part to the disc's great extras including commentary, behind-the-scenes, and some great home movies shot by fans for some contest ran before the movie premiered. I would say if you own at least four Zombie movies in your collection, Diary should be in there as well. It is a very good representative of the Digital Age & Social Commentary we now live in and how today's youth would handle it.

LAME. Now I see a week or two AFTER it's release date that it is available. Wow, SUPER LAME. I ended up buying it at my local Best Buy. I'll try not to let me disappointment in Amazon tinge my review.As Romero Zombie movies go it was definitely near the bottom of the heap. I understood waht he was trying to do it just seems a shame that SO many people for there first. Some of the zombie effects were cool and I though the CG was used sparingly and overall well done. The problem with the most recent films from Romero is he never seems able to create a character that we can actually give a crap about. If there's no sympathetic character then there is no reason to be scared, heck you actually enjoy seeing all these self involved college kids getting killed in this one. His best film is still Night of the Living Dead and I think that is because the main character was so likable. You wanted the other knuckleheads to die but Ben (Duane Jones) was cool and in charge and he really deserved to make it out. The dark twist of him actually making it through only to be killed by idiot rednecks was a shock. He's never really equalled that genius move in any of his films since although Dawn of the Dead came pretty close with the characters of Roger and Peter and Roger's tragic conversion to the undead and Peter's horrifying choice to kill him was pretty much the last time I can recall giving a dang about anyone in a Romero Zombie movie.",3,Way to not have this in stock Amazon!,1212969600,"06 9, 2008",2008,1623,"['wanted', 'buy', 'Amazon', 'was', 'loading', 'up', 'cheap', 'Blu', 'Rays', 'even', 'release', 'date', 'Amazon', 'STILL', 'did', 'not', 'list', 'available', '3rd', 'party', 'sellers', 'LAME', 'Now', 'see', 'week', 'two', 'AFTER', 'release', 'date', 'available', 'Wow', 'SUPER', 'LAME', 'ended', 'up', 'buying', 'local', 'Best', 'Buy', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'let', 'disappointment', 'Amazon', 'tinge', 'review.As', 'Romero', 'Zombie', 'movies', 'go', 'was', 'definitely', 'bottom', 'heap', 'understood', 'waht', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'just', 'shame', 'SO', 'many', 'people', 'first', 'zombie', 'effects', 'were', 'cool', 'though', 'CG', 'was', 'used', 'sparingly', 'overall', 'well', 'done', 'problem', 'most', 'recent', 'films', 'Romero', 'never', 'able', 'create', 'character', 'can', 'actually', 'give', 'crap', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'then', 'reason', 'be', 'scared', 'heck', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'self', 'involved', 'college', 'kids', 'getting', 'killed', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'still', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'think', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'likable', 'wanted', 'other', 'knuckleheads', 'die', 'Ben', 'Duane', 'Jones', 'was', 'cool', 'charge', 'really', 'deserved', 'make', 'out', 'dark', 'twist', 'actually', 'making', 'only', 'be', 'killed', 'idiot', 'rednecks', 'was', 'shock', 'never', 'really', 'equalled', 'genius', 'move', 'films', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'came', 'pretty', 'close', 'characters', 'Roger', 'Peter', 'Roger', 'tragic', 'conversion', 'undead', 'Peter', 'horrifying', 'choice', 'kill', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'last', 'time', 'can', 'recall', 'giving', 'dang', 'anyone', 'Romero', 'Zombie', 'movie']",N/A

1140853,A2VRAT69JDAD3W,B0013D8LA4,"Jason Whitt ""Whittmeister""","[1, 2]","Ever since the creation of the protoypical and legendary zombie film ""Night of the Living Dead"", and the other Romero outings that followed, fans of the genre have cemented in their minds a very specific idea of what makes a good zombie movie.While most agree that George is the king of this genre, within that universe, there is much dissent as to what makes one of them better than the other.  Some love Dawn more that Night.  Some consider Night the undisputed champ and will consider no other opinion.  Some even like Day of the Dead as much as the others.My point is that the bar for Romero films has been set so ridiculously high by rabid fans, (all with their own very specific ideas of what the ideal zombie film is), that nothing George produces will ever satisfy his entire fan base.  Such is the life of an acknowledged and prolific genius.  Those who love his work think their first experience with one of his films is the definitive one.  That's why there are unanimous lovers of Romero's work and such diverging opinion of what work is best.That brings me to Diary of the Dead.  I thought that the story was very compelling.  I genuinely cared about the characters, (the first order of business in any good horror film).  It was also acted very well by actors I did not immediately recognize.  I was impressed.  The effects were great.  George even pokes fun at his own penchant for ""subtext"" in the film.  And there is subtext in Diary.  Very relevant to our times in taking on the media machine of today as well as our rather disgusting love affair with the digital age.  It's not too heavy handed and that's important.  There is balance there because afterall we want to see some zombie action right?  There's plenty to be had and it's a fun ride with a modern spin.

As much as I enjoyed ""Land"" it still just wasn't up to snuff when compared to Romero's original trilogy.  Finally after the ""B Movie"" zombie craze has run it's course & done it's damage, comes ""Diary"".Diary is a refreshing return to the beginning of the undead plague now set in modern times.  Romero this time around perfectly sets his satirical views on our society's constant need & addiction for up to the minute news & media.  As not to spoil anything (not to mention all the other reviews beating the plot to death already), the movie is basically about a group of film students who decide the film the events of the outbreak as they unfold around them.  Now I must admit, it's a little hard to swallow that even the die hardest of die hard film maker would really keep the camera rolling through alot of the events that take place, but it certainly made for an entertaining movie.  Did these people that blasted the movie for that same reason not know what they were getting into I wonder?As far as the acting's, it's all grade A stuff as far as I'm concerned much better than your average horror amatuer schlock.  Basically just don't go into the movie expecting ""The English Patient"" & I think you'll be fine.  True alot of the film revolves around the cast talking about what's happening around them, & there aren't copses in every frame of the movie but that's character development.  Would you expect anything else from Romero?The effects as with any Romero film are again outstanding & we loose alot of the corney CGI stuff scene in ""Land"".  There are truely some great new imaginative gags.  Ever wonder how a defibulator would fare as a weapon against a flesh eating corpse?  You'll find out :P.  The documentary style of shooting really gives the film an extra creepy feel.  You feel a little less safe watching the movie.Why Diary wasn't given a wide theatrical release is absolutely mind boggling.  This is a breathe of fresh air compared to the rest of the remade, PG-13, direct to video, amatuer hour, garbage being churned out by Hollywood these days.  What else can I say, great atmosphere, great cast, grade A horror from the STILL master of horror himself, George A. Romero.

Overall, it was a decent flick but I couldn't help but feel somemthing was lacking. Romero decided to film the movie with a Blair Witch/documentary type of feel and this (I felt) kind of shorted the viewer. Instead of being able to lose yourself in the story, your constantly reminded you are in fact watching a movie.Downsides-The movie is constantly interrupted by narrative voice-overs.Because the group decides to bypass major populated areas, you never get to really see whats going on in the real world except for tiny news clips which you have to watch as the ""camera"" films the group watching on a tiny monitor.As soon as the group gets a chance to access weapons not one more gunshot is fired throughout the film (LAME).The ""camera guy's"" friends would not shut-up about him filming. Get over it already or break his camera.Upsides-Samuel the Amish guy totally rocked! (Diary is worth seeing just for this charecter alone).Zombie GoldfishA few (and sad to say I do mean few) nice zombie deaths.I'd have to say Dawn of the Dead is still remains my favorite and in order to be completely fair, as of now, I would have to rank ""Diary"" as my least favorite. I really wanted to be blown away but I have to admit I wasn't.Diary of the Dead is still worth seeing especially if your a zombie or Romero fan. Just don't have your hopes up to see anything new and innovative to be added to this genre. Keep your eye out for a George Romero cameo!

This film has the viewer hoping that the actors will die in hopes that a better movie is in the making.Recent zombie fanfare has taken the satire out of the genre, therefore an underlying diluting of the concept.

Though it was a documentary I didn't quite catch it as one or for the majority of the film. In here we have a film crew that made up of different characters: The director Jason (Joshua Close) who acts though he believes that if it didn't happen on camera, then it never happened at all. There's his girlfriend Debra (Michelle Morgan) who gets increasingly annoyed with his filming everybody, Tony (Shawn Roberts) who looks like he is prepared to beat Jason to death, and there's even the drunken film professor Maxwell (Scott Wentworth) who looks upon everything with a bemused attachment. What George Romero succeeds in doing as a writer is give us characters who aren't simple types and break those clich&eacute;s to become increasingly unpredictable in their actions.Which is one of Romero's strong attributes is that he gives us strong characters with females and minorities. He started doing this a long time ago with ""Night Of The Living Dead,"" and it continues on with this one. The female character that comes across as the strongest here is Debra, played by Michelle Morgan. She is driven to get back to her family who are back at home, and she is not about to get sucked into watching things through a camera lens. Michelle gives the strongest performance in the movie, and she also narrates the movie within the movie, so you have a pretty good idea of what happens to her character. The group does run into a squad of African Americans who have taken over a small town and all its supplies, and who refuse to leave the town. This is because for once, they have power over something that they have never had before, and you could see it as a sort of revenge against the white man for all they have put their people through.The movie does have its share of good scares, and has that same morbid humor that has been present in all of Romero's ""Dead"" movies. This does make this film relevant in a way even after four decades after the very first one. The last scene in the movie questions the audience directly as to if we as a race are really worth saving or not. That scene will stay with you long after the movie has ended because the characters have only started to learn how to exist in a post-zombie world (shades of 9/11 do abound here and there).The suspense was there along with the blood and gore, it was giving to us in a fair dose though not quite on the same level as ""Dawn"" or ""Day."" Still, there are some good kills throughout, and the characters make good use of a scythe and a bow and arrow. Romero, after all these years, doesn't skimp on the good stuff. However, it still takes these characters way too long to figure out that the best way to defeat a zombie is to shoot it in the head. Aside from that I was slightly disappointed with this film or documentary. I'm thinking there may be room for another one Romero zombie yet, and there is hope to be had in that even if the world is still falling apart. I wouldn't mind seeing him do one more, but I hope it comes out before the apocalypse hits us.",3,I can't hate the man at least he tried,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,3124,"['thought', 'film', 'was', 'okay', 'know', 'myself', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'favorite', 'bunch', 'was', 'documentary', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'catch', 'one', 'majority', 'film', 'here', 'have', 'film', 'crew', 'made', 'different', 'characters', 'director', 'Jason', 'Joshua', 'Close', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'camera', 'then', 'never', 'happened', 'girlfriend', 'Debra', 'Michelle', 'Morgan', 'who', 'increasingly', 'annoyed', 'filming', 'everybody', 'Tony', 'Shawn', 'Roberts', 'who', 'prepared', 'beat', 'Jason', 'death', 'even', 'drunken', 'film', 'professor', 'Maxwell', 'Scott', 'Wentworth', 'who', 'everything', 'bemused', 'attachment', 'What', 'George', 'Romero', 'doing', 'writer', 'give', 'characters', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'simple', 'types', 'break', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'become', 'increasingly', 'unpredictable', 'actions.Which', 'one', 'Romero', 'strong', 'attributes', 'strong', 'characters', 'females', 'minorities', 'started', 'doing', 'long', 'time', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'one', 'female', 'character', 'strongest', 'here', 'Debra', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Morgan', 'driven', 'get', 'back', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'back', 'home', 'not', 'get', 'sucked', 'watching', 'things', 'camera', 'lens', 'Michelle', 'strongest', 'performance', 'movie', 'also', 'movie', 'movie', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'character', 'group', 'run', 'squad', 'African', 'Americans', 'who', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'small', 'town', 'supplies', 'who', 'refuse', 'leave', 'town', 'once', 'have', 'power', 'something', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'could', 'see', 'sort', 'revenge', 'white', 'man', 'have', 'put', 'people', 'through.The', 'movie', 'have', 'share', 'good', 'scares', 'same', 'morbid', 'humor', 'been', 'present', 'Romero', 'Dead', 'movies', 'make', 'film', 'relevant', 'way', 'even', 'four', 'decades', 'very', 'first', 'one', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'questions', 'audience', 'directly', 'race', 'are', 'really', 'worth', 'saving', 'not', 'scene', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'movie', 'ended', 'characters', 'have', 'only', 'started', 'learn', 'how', 'exist', 'post-zombie', 'world', 'shades', '9/11', 'do', 'abound', 'here', 'there', '.The', 'suspense', 'was', 'there', 'along', 'blood', 'gore', 'was', 'giving', 'fair', 'dose', 'not', 'quite', 'same', 'level', 'Dawn', 'Day', 'Still', 'are', 'good', 'kills', 'characters', 'make', 'good', 'use', 'scythe', 'bow', 'arrow', 'Romero', 'years', ""n't"", 'skimp', 'good', 'stuff', 'However', 'still', 'characters', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'figure', 'out', 'best', 'way', 'defeat', 'zombie', 'shoot', 'head', 'Aside', 'was', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'film', 'documentary', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'may', 'be', 'room', 'one', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'yet', 'hope', 'be', 'had', 'even', 'world', 'still', 'falling', 'apart', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'do', 'one', 'more', 'hope', 'out', 'apocalypse']",N/A

This movie rivals this year's ""Cloverfield"" but this could be even better, there's plenty of suspense and graphic gore to satisfy fans of the genre and the franchise.This DVD has some nice extras like an informative audio commentary from the filmmakers, Feature length documentary on the film, two featurettes, 8 short zombie films from Filmmaker fans from Myspace contest winners, and Character Confessionals interviews.",5,A worthy installment of the Romero zombie saga!,1211500800,"05 23, 2008",2008,1247,"['Set', 'events', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'group', 'film', 'students', 'were', 'out', 'film', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'flick', 'instead', 'find', 'one', 'real', 'mysterious', 'plague', 'causing', 'dead', 'rise', 'graves', 'anyone', 'bitten', 'dead', 'can', 'change', 'zombies', 'Jason', 'Creed', 'crew', 'travel', 'state', 'cameras', 'filming', 'horrors', 'are', 'facing', 'trip', 'documentary', 'called', 'Death', 'Death', '.Marvelous', 'interesting', 'installment', 'legendary', 'zombie', 'series', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'perhaps', 'best', 'horror', 'movie', 'year', 'very', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Cannibal', 'Holocaust', '-esque', 'movie', 'viewer', 'terrifying', 'grisly', 'journey', 'hell', 'eyes', 'filmmakers', 'point', 'view', 'movie', 'year', 'Cloverfield', 'could', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'plenty', 'suspense', 'graphic', 'gore', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'genre', 'franchise.This', 'DVD', 'nice', 'extras', 'informative', 'audio', 'commentary', 'filmmakers', 'Feature', 'documentary', 'film', 'two', 'featurettes', '8', 'short', 'zombie', 'films', 'Filmmaker', 'fans', 'Myspace', 'contest', 'winners', 'Character', 'Confessionals', 'interviews']",N/A
1140863,A3F9VH8916IA40,B0013D8LA4,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[4, 5]","Romero has been watching too many zombie movies. Yes, I know, that sounds a little weird, the man who practically invented the zombie movie, and who's masterpiece Night of the Living Dead has served as the inspiration for every undead film since is watching too many zombie films? Nonsense you say, crazy says another, what on earth makes me think that? Just look at the Romero of old, from the days of Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead and you'll notice that he doesn't rely on cheap tricks and logical inconsistencies to scare you. He's actually pretty straight forward when it comes to his scares. Here is a list of inconsistencies common to zombie films that Romero has seemed to pick up on.1. Zombies don't hide and wait for people to stumble upon them to attack, they just attack. In two cases (maybe more but I can only remember two) the people and zombies were in the same building for about ten minutes before the zombies decided to come out of the closet and eat. This never happened in Romero's older movies (okay maybe it happened once in Dawn of the Dead), the zombies acted like zombies there, but in modern zombie films the zombies often times will seem to stalk their prey. Zombies don't hide from people and mount a surprise attack, they just attack.2. Gory=scary. It doesn't. Gore is always good to have in a zombie movie, but when the gore replaces the scares then we have a problem. Romero's dead films have always been gory, from the comical attempt of Dawn of the Dead with the blue man group trying to break into a mall to Day of the Deads' rubber chicken mixed with pig guts. But both those movies also had a sense of dread going along with them. The unbeatable hordes of zombies, growing steadily every day, slowly breaking down your defenses, moaning for your flesh. Very creepy. Not here though. There is no mounting sense of dread. It's just gore, gore, and more gore.A team of film students from the University of Pittsburgh are shooting a low budget horror film when news reports of the dead coming to life start coming over the radio. The group splits up but most end up going on a road trip across Pennsylvania to escape the growing number of undead who are roaming the countryside. Jason, the supposed leader of the group, takes it upon himself to film the disaster as it unfolds and put his video on YouTube so that hopefully people will see it and learn how to survive. The film should have been called ""Road Trip of the Dead"" because that's what it ends up being anyway. First they go here, run into zombies, kill a few and lose a member, only to hit the road again and repeat the process somewhere else, all while Jason films everything. Go here, kill zombies someone dies, go there kill some zombies someone dies. On and one and on and on.The two biggest problems I found with the film though were the horrible acting, and the lack of believability with the documentary footage. There are no good actors in this film, with the exception of the professor who's drinking and preference to bows and arrows over guns was quite amusing. The narration is annoying and unnecessary, and the rest of the acting is either too much or too little, never the right amount. I found the character Jason to be especially annoying with his refusal to put down that stupid camera under any circumstances. Girlfriends little brother just tried to kill her? Don't help, film it. Zombie horde closing in? Don't help fix the van, film it. At one point one of the girls in the group is being chased by a zombie and he just follows them filming it, and lending no kind of help whatsoever. What a guy. If there are people like this I hope their first to be zombiefied. The film is shot on two hand held cameras documentary style much like Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield, but unlike those two films I never believed this was actually a documentary. It's different from those two films because not just the tape, it's edited and narrated, but even the parts which are just the guy filming don't have that documentary feel to it. It felt staged, scripted, not like a documentary should be. It never seemed like this was actual footage. That's what sets this film apart from other documentary style films.The film had some pretty good ideas going for it, such as the road trip across undead America (all of Romero's previous films had the heroes held up in a fortress of some kind cut off from the outside world) and the news footage which really helped in showing just how the zombie plague was spreading. Got to say I loved the Amish guy who couldn't speak and who everyone thought was a zombie because he could only moan, even if he did just become cannon fodder. This film could have been really good, but alas it seemed like something a college student would make, not a seasoned veteran who's made lots of great films in the past. It was also pretty neat how Romero weaved in elements from Night of the Living Dead (he puts in part of the radio report from that film) and Dawn of the Dead (I didn't' see the guy with the camera filming that part in the apartment complex). The ending though was pretty lame.I love Romero's films people, heck I even liked Land of the Dead, NO ONE liked Land of the Dead, except me, but even I couldn't give this movie anything more then two stars. I'm a pretty tolerant guy, but this isn't a good film, its preachy, not scary, and has some pretty major flaws.The closing question this film asks is, are we really worth saving? Well I sure hope so, because if we aren't then nothing is.Replay value; Low.",2,Not as fun as it sounds.,1211414400,"05 22, 2008",2008,5559,"['Romero', 'been', 'watching', 'too', 'many', 'zombie',

1140864,A3N0LBOUQAD1BG,B0013D8LA4,"Jonnathan Ritland ""Hank Peters, Italian Grocer""","[0, 0]","(Possible Spoilers)Some college students are filming a movie about a mummy in the forest for a school project, they then hear the news about the dead waking up and attacking people. At this point they go their separate ways to make sure their loved ones are safe, one of them takes the camera and from here on out we are treated to seeing the action from the point of view of which ever actor is holding the camera.This is quite a bad and cheesy flick, the acting is quite horrid (yes its a no name cast but still really bad), people do things just for seemingly no reason other than advancing the plot (i.e. a girl accidentaly runs over some people, questions if they were really dead then later shoots herself out of guilt).There are a lot of problems here in this one, and the guy holding the camera seems so determined to get everything on film that he neglects to ever help his friends when he's in danger. There's a point where they video chat with a friend of their's, who is at a house they can be safe at, but this friend talk about not feeling his best and seems kinda shaky (gee wonder what the chances are that he's been bitten by a zombie?)Given how the film just plods along at a snails pace, actually makes me think zombies edited and paced the movie themselves cause no sane human could've thought this was a good way to build any tension or generate any scares. The closing scenes are especially laughable including when the actor with the camera just runs off to film more stuff despite having just reached a point of safety only to get attacked moments later (which I personally cheered for).I would go so far as to say I hate this movie, its just about as close to the bottom as a zombie movie with a budget could get. 1/2 out of 4 stars.",1,First person horrifying boredom,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,1758,"['Possible', 'Spoilers', 'college', 'students', 'are', 'filming', 'movie', 'mummy', 'forest', 'school', 'project', 'then', 'hear', 'news', 'dead', 'waking', 'up', 'attacking', 'people', 'point', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'make', 'sure', 'loved', 'ones', 'are', 'safe', 'one', 'camera', 'here', 'are', 'treated', 'seeing', 'action', 'point', 'view', 'ever', 'actor', 'holding', 'camera.This', 'quite', 'bad', 'cheesy', 'flick', 'acting', 'quite', 'horrid', 'yes', 'name', 'cast', 'still', 'really', 'bad', 'people', 'do', 'things', 'just', 'seemingly', 'reason', 'other', 'advancing', 'plot', 'i.e', 'girl', 'accidentaly', 'people', 'questions', 'were', 'really', 'dead', 'then', 'later', 'shoots', 'guilt', 'are', 'lot', 'problems', 'here', 'one', 'guy', 'holding', 'camera', 'so', 'determined', 'get', 'everything', 'film', 'ever', 'help', 'friends', 'when', 'danger', 'point', 'where', 'video', 'chat', 'friend', 'who', 'house', 'can', 'be', 'safe', 'friend', 'talk', 'not', 'feeling', 'best', 'kinda', 'shaky', 'gee', 'wonder', 'what', 'chances', 'are', 'been', 'bitten', 'zombie', 'how', 'film', 'just', 'plods', 'along', 'snails', 'pace', 'actually', 'think', 'zombies', 'edited', 'paced', 'movie', 'cause', 'sane', 'human', 'could', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'way', 'build', 'tension', 'generate', 'scares', 'closing', 'scenes', 'are', 'especially', 'laughable', 'including', 'when', 'actor', 'camera', 'just', 'film', 'more', 'stuff', 'having', 'just', 'reached', 'point', 'safety', 'only', 'get', 'attacked', 'moments', 'later', 'personally', 'cheered', '.I', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'hate', 'movie', 'just', 'as', 'close', 'bottom', 'zombie', 'movie', 'budget', 'could', 'get', '1/2', '4', 'stars']",N/A

Menta, Jr.","[0, 1]","2008's ""Diary of the Dead"" is a little seen but pretty good zombie movie, utilizing the ""found footage"" and ""characters making a movie on the run"" genre of thriller film making popularized by movies like ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"".  Set in the initial days of a zombie apocalypse (it's mostly left up to the viewer whether director George Romero is re-booting his zombie universe or simply choosing to set this story in the early days of the same timeline he's been exploring for years, with a little artistic license to allow for the use of cell phone cameras, social networking sites, and other modern communication conveniences), we follow a group of students and their professor as they try to make sense of the dead now coming back to life.The student characters are mostly whiny and annoying, but no more so than similar characters seen in other horror movies (besides, don't unlikable characters often make for the most satisfying death scenes?).  Conversely, the professor character is kind of fun, as his main concern seems to be whether the group's latest hideout at any given time has a fully-stocked bar.  I think I would worry about a bar, too, if I was on the run from zombies.""Diary of the Dead"" is slick, fast, doesn't overstay its welcome, and features lots of creepy zombie action (though some of the CGI effects are better than others).  The movie looks sharp and clean on standard DVD, and the DVD features a generous amount of special features.  While perhaps not up to the classic standard set by his initial zombie films (1968's ""Night of the Living Dead"", 1978's ""Dawn of the Dead"", and 1985's ""Day of the Dead""), the tension, scares, and raw immediacy of ""Diary of the Dead"" definitely make it worth a look.",4,"Dear Diary, the zombies are after me",1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,1749,"['2008', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'little', 'seen', 'pretty', 'good', 'zombie', 'movie', 'utilizing', 'found', 'footage', 'characters', 'making', 'movie', 'run', 'genre', 'thriller', 'film', 'making', 'popularized', 'movies', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Cloverfield', 'Set', 'initial', 'days', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'mostly', 'left', 'up', 'viewer', 'director', 'George', 'Romero', 're-booting', 'zombie', 'universe', 'simply', 'choosing', 'set', 'story', 'early', 'days', 'same', 'timeline', 'been', 'exploring', 'years', 'little', 'artistic', 'license', 'allow', 'use', 'cell', 'phone', 'cameras', 'social', 'networking', 'sites', 'other', 'modern', 'communication', 'conveniences', 'follow', 'group', 'students', 'professor', 'try', 'make', 'sense', 'dead', 'now', 'coming', 'back', 'life.The', 'student', 'characters', 'are', 'mostly', 'whiny', 'annoying', 'more', 'so', 'similar', 'characters', 'seen', 'other', 'horror', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'unlikable', 'characters', 'often', 'make', 'most', 'satisfying', 'death', 'scenes', 'Conversely', 'professor', 'character', 'kind', 'fun', 'main', 'concern', 'be', 'group', 'latest', 'hideout', 'given', 'time', 'fully-stocked', 'bar', 'think', 'would', 'worry', 'bar', 'too', 'was', 'run', 'zombies', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'slick', 'fast', ""n't"", 'overstay', 'welcome', 'lots', 'creepy', 'zombie', 'action', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'better', 'others', 'movie', 'sharp', 'clean', 'standard', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'generous', 'amount', 'special', 'features', 'perhaps', 'not', 'classic', 'standard', 'set', 'initial', 'zombie', 'films', '1968', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', '1978', 'Dawn', 'Dead', '1985', 'Day', 'Dead', 'tension', 'scares', 'raw', 'immediacy', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'definitely', 'make', 'look']",N/A
1140867,A1LAJ5HX8CTYCV,B0013D8LA4,Joshua B. Anderson,"[0, 1]","There is nothing more cinematically satisfying to me than a zombie film, especially any of Romero's Dead series. Night, Day, Dawn, and Land are ranked high on my list of zombie films and even horror films, so where does Romero's fifthy entry in his series lie in my top? Sadly, it's not up there with the previous four. That doesn't mean that I saw, I didn't enjoy.The first-person camera aspect of the film is becoming popular years after it was done in The Blair Witch. Cloverfield did it and did it well. Diary of the Dead was lower-scale (also that way in comparison with the other Dead movies) and more personal, and I think that's a part of the reason why I enjoyed it so much. Romero through in his usual commentary on the world with how everything is available to see due to the extremely easy accessibility of recorded evidence. Of course, a bit of unbelievability is required to view this film because in a situation like this, I don't necessarily think that anyone would keep a hold on a camera although Romero's characters reason was to show the world what was actually happening since the government was lying. I'm pretty sure the world could just look out their windows and see what was actually happening.What I really liked about Diary was the character's reactions to what was going on around them. I don't know if it was a directorial choice, but they seemed so sensitized to what was going on. There weren't any overreactions (unless they were literally attacked), each character automatically manned up and used any way possible to approach the dead and dispose of them.As for the creep factor, there were a few moments that got to me, but one scene in particular really spooked me. That scene being in the hospital when something appears in the far corner of the camera and then burst into frame.Although a little dissapointed that Romero decided to revision his own series and with lost hope that we will see a continuation of Land of the Dead, I was slightly surprised with his new path. Now I'm stuck with which continuation would I want to see.

Thus what you have before you are some rambling comments on the film and at least one of the major complaints I've heard about it.Like everyone else who refers to him or herself as a horror fan, I love Romero's previous work. Although LAND OF THE DEAD is taking its own sweet time to grow on me this is not unprecedented since DAY OF THE DEAD had the very same effect on me--DAY OF THE DEAD took a good decade and a half for me to be able to appreciate its charms, it was a case of loathe at first sight. I admit that this is as a result of my inability to cope with Romero's change in tone rather than any defect in the film itself. Its more than likely that this will also prove to be the case with LAND OF THE DEAD which I have only managed to watch once since its release.My reaction to DIARY OF THE DEAD was as quick as my reaction to DAY had been, but in exactly the opposite direction. Perhaps I'm simply being my normal contrary self and responding to all the negative reviews by coming out in favor of the film, but I don't think so, not this time. I was immediately relieved to learn that Romero had dropped the notion of zombie civilization for the time being because that brings with it all sorts of awkward questions, such as the delicate subject of being asked to feel sympathetic toward creatures who still need human brains in order to survive no matter how much they want to just pull a Greta Garbo and be left alone!What I was happiest with was that he wasn't hammering his social message home as heavy handedly as I had feared after having seen LAND OF THE DEAD which was almost embarrassingly blatant in its delivery. In fact everyone claims to have ""gotten"" his message as they proceed to pan his film for not having enough carnage and ""serious zombie dining"" in it to quote my favorite phrase from Main Man's review, but I think they only ""got"" half of his message--the obvious half having to do with the distance that the media, television and internet have put between us and reality. They missed the more nebulous part about how films such as his own have decreased the value of a single life until it has come to mean nothing at all. Its just another death. And that doesn't mean anything at all--its all about the body count. To quote the film:""Its strange how looking at things, seeing things through a lens, a glass, rose-colored or shaded black, you become immune. You're supposed to be affected, but you're not. I used to think it was just you out there, the viewers, but its not. Its us as well, the shooters. We become immune too--innoculated so that whatever happens around us, no matter how horrible it is, we just wind up taking it all in stride. Just another day. Just another death.""The above quote from the end of the film makes me wonder if, as he nears the end of his own life, Romero isn't standing back and asking himself whether his films haven't contributed  just a little bit to the devaluation of the worth of a single life. Or at least whether the violence in his films hasn't in some way negatively affected his own life...Just some rambling thoughts.Liked the movie though, although time may reduce the rating to a somewhat more realistic 4 stars.",5,JUST ANOTHER DEATH,1215043200,"07 3, 2008",2008,3377,"['So', 'much', 'been', 'said', 'DIARY', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'already', 'even', 'attempting', 'write', 'depth', 'review', 'point', 'would', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'probably', 'yours', 'as', 'well', 'Thus', 'what', 'have', 'are', 'rambling', 'comments', 'film', 'least', 'one', 'major', 'complaints', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'it.Like', 'everyone', 'else', 'who', 'horror', 'fan', 'love', 'Romero', 'previous', 'work', 'LAND', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'taking', 'own', 'sweet', 'time', 'grow', 'not', 'unprecedented', 'DAY', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'had', 'very', 'same', 'effect', 'DAY', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'took', 'good', 'decade', 'half', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'charms', 'was', 'case', 'loathe', 'first', 'sight', 'admit', 'result', 'inability', 'cope', 'Romero', 'change', 'tone', 'rather', 'defect', 'film', 'more', 'likely', 'will', 'also', 'prove', 'be', 'case', 'LAND', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'have', 'only', 'managed', 'watch', 'once', 'release.My', 'reaction', 'DIARY', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'was', 'as', 'quick', 'reaction', 'DAY', 'had', 'been', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'direction', 'Perhaps', ""'m"", 'simply', 'being', 'normal', 'contrary', 'self', 'responding', 'negative', 'reviews', 'coming', 'out', 'favor', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'not', 'time', 'was', 'immediately', 'relieved', 'learn', 'Romero', 'had', 'dropped', 'notion', 'zombie', 'civilization', 'time', 'being', 'sorts', 'awkward', 'questions', 'such', 'delicate', 'subject', 'being', 'asked', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'creatures', 'who', 'still', 'need', 'human', 'brains', 'order', 'survive', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'want', 'just', 'pull', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'What', 'was', 'happiest', 'was', 'was', ""n't"", 'hammering', 'social', 'message', 'home', 'heavy', 'handedly', 'had', 'feared', 'having', 'seen', 'LAND', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'was', 'almost', 'embarrassingly', 'blatant', 'delivery', 'fact', 'everyone', 'claims', 'have', 'gotten', 'message', 'proceed', 'pan', 'film', 'not', 'having', 'enough', 'carnage', 'serious', 'zombie', 'dining', 'quote', 'favorite', 'phrase', 'Main', 'Man', 'review', 'think', 'only', 'got', 'half', 'message', 'obvious', 'half', 'having', 'do', 'distance', 'media', 'television', 'internet', 'have', 'put', 'reality', 'missed', 'more', 'nebulous', 'part', 'how', 'films', 'such', 'own', 'have', 'decreased', 'value', 'single', 'life', 'come', 'mean', 'nothing', 'just', 'death', ""n't"", 'mean', 'anything', 'body', 'count', 'quote', 'film', 'strange', 'how', 'looking', 'things', 'seeing', 'things', 'lens', 'glass', 'rose-colored', 'shaded', 'black', 'become', 'immune', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'affected', ""'re"", 'not', 'used', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'there', 'viewers', 'not', 'well', 'shooters', 'become', 'immune', 'too', 'innoculated', 'so', 'whatever', 'matter', 'how', 'horrible', 'just', 'wind', 'up', 'taking', 'stride', 'Just', 'day', 'Just', 'death', 'above', 'quote', 'end', 'film', 'wonder', 'end', 'own', 'life', 'Romero', ""n't"", 'standing', 'back', 'asking', 'films', 'have', ""n't"", 'contributed', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'devaluation', 'worth', 'single', 'life', 'least', 'violence', 'films', ""n't"", 'way', 'negatively', 'affected', 'own', 'life', 'Just', 'rambling', 'thoughts.Liked', 'movie', 'time', 'may', 'reduce', 'rating', 'somewhat', 'more', 'realistic', '4', 'stars']",N/A

Some won't like it because it isn't wall to wall gore, blood and guts.  Some won't like it because there aren't screen-fulls of grunting zombies.  I thought it was a fine mix.  There are a few chuckles and a few ""ewwws"" to go with everything else.  There are quite a few special features on the DVD like a full length documentary, cast interviews and commntary track (and more).A lot of reviewers are dogging the actors, but I thought they were pretty good.  Remember, this isn't a hundred-million dollar blowout.  George Romero indicated he originally wanted to do a direct to DVD movie so he could have complete creative control (which aparently he didn't have in Land of the Dead).  The Company said let's make it a low budget feature and it got very limited release.  I am in Texas and could never locate it in the entire state when it came out.Lastly, whether people hate Diary of the Dead or love it right now doesn't really matter much as it will be the future when it will be considered a true classic or not.

After reading the reviews here, some positive and some negative I feel that I can't hold out any longer.Let me start off by saying YES, I'm a Romero fanboy. I'm also proud of that fact. I loved ""Bruiser"" even with its flaws. We here are all Romero fans, and just because you liked a movie that I didn't doesn't change that fact. We just have a difference of opinion. I originally hated ""The 9th Gate"" and watched it a few years later to find that I missed the point originally and now love it. Keep that in mind when reading my review.Diary of the Dead feels rushed and is plain sloppy. Romero falling into the trap of writing a script with late teen early 20's characters is a huge disappointment. He had an amazing idea, but carried it out poorly. He tried to come at this movie from so many different angles that it never really finds itself.On the FX. I didn't find the CGI horrible, however Romero's FX have always been amazing. It was disappointing to see him resort to the easy payoff like so many directors before.*spoilers*Maybe he should have revolved the story around the ebony warriors. He seemed to have something going there for a bit then let it slip through his fingers. They were interesting, organized and could have carried the movie further than the ""Scooby Gang"" minus a talking dog.The portrayal of the Amish/Quaker guy was a complete miss. It's obvious Romero's never actually known one. The guy would have died faster than Ghandi before resorting to violence.Where did everyone go? There were no bodies, no living people, not many zombies, so what happened to them all? I know where they went. They were waiting in the woods to surround the ""fortress"" at the end of the film.Romero has always had a political agenda. Typically I've never really cared or minded. The earlier films are just too amazing to care. However with the release of ""Land of the Dead"" that agenda started to miss its target and become annoying.Where the movie really fell apart (besides being pretty boring through out) was the last 20 minutes. When they realized that mummy man had killed one of the last members of their team why didn't they decide to investigate? The girl getting her top ripped off was a cheap move and one that Romero never had to resort to in his early ""Dead"" films. Don't get me wrong I love B films, but not ones that try to take themselves seriously.Where did the girl from Texas run off to with little or no gas? That whole scene seemed to be tossed in for a little comedic value.I can't call this horror, I can't call it campy, I can't call it suspenseful.I rate a movie by its rewatch value and I can't see myself watching this one again. Even if I tried I know I wouldn't make it all the way through.I feel that once the newness of this newest ""Dead"" release wears off it's true longevity will become more apparent. I just can't force myself to like this movie.I'm glad it was a rental.

1140873,A1H89KJ9KF1SB9,B0013D8LA4,"Kody Boye ""Horror Author""","[2, 3]","A homemade movie is a beautiful thing. What starts out as a simple project can quickly turn into something bigger, especially when a virus hits the United States and starts bringing people back from the dead.Welcome to George Romero's DIARY OF THE DEAD.Set in Pennsylvania and following a group of University of Pittsburgh students, DIARY OF THE DEAD chronicles a group of survivor's journey from beginning to end. Starting in the woods during a senior project film project, the group is quickly distracted after Elliot--the braniac--tells everyone that they `need to hear this.'`This' happens to be the reports that the dead are coming back to life.After the mummy (the `monster' of the movie) and his girlfriend leave the scene, the rest of the group quickly decide to leave. Mary--who's woman in command of a good-sized camp trailer--begins to take them back home, but not before something strange becomes apparent. When a burned-beyond-recognition cop stumbles from the scene of an accident and into traffic, Mary quickly stops the camper, then pushes past him and onto the main road.She runs over three people--three `dead' people.Traumatized beyond belief, they pull over on the side of the road, only to have Mary attempt an act of suicide.In a desperate rush to save their friend, the group flees to the hospital.It soon becomes apparent that this isn't all a hoax when they find the hospital abandoned of people.As a fan of Romero's original DEAD trilogy (consisting of Night of the Living Dead, Dawn and Day of the Dead,) as well as the fourth installment LAND, I was more than willing to watch this unique and fifth installment, although I will admit to being a bit wary about it being shot in a handheld/over-the-shoulder-camera angle. I was quickly able to get past this insecurity though, as the film is shot with stability and without a lot of rough running and tilting. The main thing I liked about the movie was the fact that it was shot like it was--from the perspective of a few college men and women with a camera.Now, although I enjoyed this movie, I did have a few quirks with it.-- In the beginning, Deborah (the main narrator of the `film') mentions that she's `edited the footage' and `added music' in an attempt to scare the viewer. Why, I ask, would someone attempt (or want) to do this when they're running from the end of the world? It begs to question the motive of the film, and the footage we as the viewers see. Did we see the end of the world from the perspective of a few college students, or were we hoaxed with some elaborate special affects--CGI and trick camera angles meant to confuse the viewer. We also have to take into consideration that, if they WERE really in the end of the world, and the internet WAS failing, how did they upload it to the internet, if they even did? Did the group survive and eventually upload the video after the United States became stable, or did another survivor find their footage, then view it as we the audience did? I can only assume that this `fault' (if you would even call it that) was Romero's way of making us question the film. Like Night and its racial undertones, Dawn and its commercial abstraction, and Day and its confusion with the military, I can only assume that Diary was meant to symbolize the media and how we can't always believe what we see on TV.-- There were points during the movie--particularly when the Texan woman took off in the camper--that seemed unrealistic. During the point in which the group is attacked, then rescued by a group of survivors holing up in a warehouse, Deborah demands for the leader to give them food while a gun is being shoved in her face. The fact that any person in their right mind would do this is beyond me. Given the way the group originally attacked Elliot and knocked him down to the ground, it surprised me that the warehouse survivors would so easily give into helpless stranger's demands. As also mentioned above, the blonde-haired Texan woman took off in the camper for no apparent or logical reason near the end of the movie. I can understand why someone would suddenly take off on a whim like she did (from fear, confusion or panic,) but up until that point, she seemed extremely stable, especially after having to kill her boyfriend. Deborah experienced the same kind of character development problems. Her whole family was murdered in front of her eyes, yet she only seems slightly disturbed and says, `Thank you?' I screamed and bawled my eyes out when I thought my cat was hit by a car a few months back--I can't imagine just sitting there like I'd just been punched in the gut after my whole family was killed.-- Character development was also faintly sparse throughout the movie. While some characters developed extremely well (Deborah, despite her blunt emotions, and the professor, despite his quiet demeanor,) the majority of them remained the same and two-dimensional. Jake seemed to care about nothing more than filming, even going so far as to leave the group in order to keep filming, the Texan woman isn't traumatized by her boyfriend's death and takes off without warning, and the professor's only real point is to say the occasional insightful thing, and be a complete badass with a bow.Despite my three major points with the movie, I can say that I enjoyed DIARY OF THE DEAD more than any other movie I've tried to watch recently. The tension keeps you going, the action is done in traditional Romero style, and the metaphorical undertones spruced throughout the story make you question the intent of the film.Although I can't say that Diary has taken its spot as my favorite (or second or third favorite) zombie movie, I have to place it in my top ten. It kept me entertained--I don't see why it can't why it wouldn't keep another Romero fan on the edge of their seats.",3,When you film a diary...,1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,5825,"['homemade',

I also hate Shakey Cam shooting. Another annoyance is the suspense technique of shooting in a completely dark room with a minute light source that shows nothing; I'll take an armature day-for-night shot over that any day of the week. My discrepancies are really no different than they would be with any movie that uses these techniques.Romero has his own style & because he's trying another director's style, it just doesn't feel like a Romero film. Typical of the FF genre, the acting is overly melodramatic & when people become hysterical, they all have the same personality & barely react differently to situations. The dialogue & reactions create an ""uncanny valley"" feel to the cast, with entire ""real people don't talk that way"" conversations, because in the attempt to make it seem more real, it seems less real. & like most post 90s horror movies, I found myself not liking the cast or caring to see if they survived, perhaps because of the lack of deep character development. Having a casual narrator that you can forget about who occasionally remind you that you're watching footage of footage or a reenactment of it or whatever, like a Discovery documentary, is also very irritating. It also has that one guy that's in every found footage movie, the one who just can't put the camera down, even if it costs him his life, & argues with his lover who thinks his obsessive need to film is stupid. There's also a jarring moment where the movie starts playing ""The Yellow Rose of Texas"" that really rips you out of the movie. If it were any other director, I would have complained that the move felt unfinished, but the ""Of the Dead"" thing is a series & there are already 2 sequels.There are a few nice moments all in a row; the news montages (which would have been better unnarated), the mute Amish farmer chucking a grenade at a bunch of zombies, the video of the zombie clown ruining a birthday party, & then the way the farmer reacted to being bitten. It also has the nice traditional slow stupid zombies that just seem to make more sense for something dead & decaying. There's also a refreshing lack of in-your-face CG; the only notable moment being the zombie who was attacked with acid & a head-spliting scene.Random though: I love listening to Scott Wentworth talk in the movie, & his dialogue is perhaps the most over-the-top.

Contrary to what most people say, I do believe you can have a good zombie movie without having zombies in it every 5 seconds.

1140880,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0013D8LA4,Mark Turner,"[0, 2]","In 1968, unknown director George Romero and a group of friends put together what has been hailed as one of the greatest horror films ever made. Unfortunately none of them ever saw much in the way of money from the film's distributor, but they've made up for it since. The movie was NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.Now Romero returns to his roots with his latest excursion into the world of zombies with DIARY OF THE DEAD. Taking place during the same time period as the first film (not '68 but in the zombie timeline or when the zombie plague first begins), Romero gives it a fresh look and turn.A group of college students are out shooting a horror film, a mummy movie, when they get word that the outbreak has begun. A news station is airing footage of 3 murder victims who rise off their gurneys and attack the EMTs sent to pick them up. The students pack up and head for the dorms.When they arrive, they find that no one has remained and decide to make the trek to their own homes as well. Fortunately one of them has a motor home and they set out. The entire movie is filmed as if it were a documentary ala BLAIR WITCH/CLOVERFIELD. These are film students after all. But the main person in charge, Jason (Joshua Close) is so detached from all that he films that he never sees until too late what is going on around him.The group consists of Jason's girlfriend Deb (Michelle Morgan) whose home they are trying to reach first, Eliot (Joe Dinicol). Tony (Shawn Roberts), Tracy (Amy LaLonde), Gordo (Chris Violette) and their film instructor Professor Maxwell (Scott Wentworth). Each has their own part to play in the story and the acting is never an issue. They all do a great job.Central to the story is Deb who's constantly worried about her family. At the same time, she draws further away from Jason as he focuses solely on his film, explaining that it's important that someone document what is happening for others to see. The problem is that in so doing, he detaches himself from reality and from those around him.The film move at a steady pace as the group encounters everything from their first zombie on the road to zombies in an abandoned hospital. The reality of death and of the dead rising is handled by each in their own way as survival instinct kick into overdrive and they move forward. We watch as humans decided not to sit and take it, but to move forward with the hope that something, somewhere, their old lives remain intact.Fans of the series of films Romero has made know up front that the zombie invasion will change things. While zombies make up the low percentage of those walking at the beginning, eventually they outnumber the living by the time his last film LAND OF THE DEAD took place. What we see here is a precursor to what is to come.Some say that the handheld look seems lacking. I thought that it added to the story. It made a statement about the use of cameras from news footage to kids falling off skateboards in clips online. People take themselves out of the picture and seek only entertainment value at the expense of others. They do detach themselves from reality. And it's sad to think that in so doing, they drop us a notch down the evolutionary scale.Romero has taken what could have become a lame genre filled with the same old same old and given it an injection of something new. The film stands on its own or fits well into the series started over 40 years ago by the same man. It has its share of scares, of commentary and of human interests. It's like seeing it all over again for the first time and it holds your interest from beginning to end.",5,ROMERO REMAINS ON TOP,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,3589,"['1968', 'unknown', 'director', 'George', 'Romero', 'group', 'friends', 'put', 'together', 'what', 'been', 'hailed', 'one', 'greatest', 'horror', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'Unfortunately', 'none', 'ever', 'saw', 'much', 'way', 'money', 'film', 'distributor', ""'ve"", 'made', 'up', 'movie', 'was', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD.Now', 'Romero', 'roots', 'latest', 'excursion', 'world', 'zombies', 'DIARY', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'Taking', 'place', 'same', 'time', 'period', 'first', 'film', 'not', ""'68"", 'zombie', 'timeline', 'when', 'zombie', 'plague', 'first', 'Romero', 'fresh', 'look', 'turn.A', 'group', 'college', 'students', 'are', 'out', 'shooting', 'horror', 'film', 'mummy', 'movie', 'when', 'get', 'word', 'outbreak', 'begun', 'news', 'station', 'airing', 'footage', '3', 'murder', 'victims', 'who', 'rise', 'off', 'gurneys', 'attack', 'EMTs', 'sent', 'pick', 'up', 'students', 'pack', 'up', 'head', 'dorms.When', 'arrive', 'find', 'one', 'remained', 'decide', 'make', 'trek', 'own', 'homes', 'as', 'well', 'Fortunately', 'one', 'motor', 'home', 'set', 'out', 'entire', 'movie', 'filmed', 'were', 'documentary', 'ala', 'BLAIR', 'WITCH/CLOVERFIELD', 'are', 'film', 'students', 'main', 'person', 'charge', 'Jason', 'Joshua', 'Close', 'so', 'detached', 'never', 'too', 'late', 'what', 'going', 'him.The', 'group', 'Jason', 'girlfriend', 'Deb', 'Michelle', 'Morgan', 'home', 'are', 'trying', 'reach', 'first', 'Eliot', 'Joe', 'Dinicol', 'Tony', 'Shawn', 'Roberts', 'Tracy', 'Amy', 'LaLonde', 'Gordo', 'Chris', 'Violette', 'film', 'instructor', 'Professor', 'Maxwell', 'Scott', 'Wentworth', 'own', 'part', 'play', 'story', 'acting', 'never', 'issue', 'do', 'great', 'job.Central', 'story', 'Deb', 'who', 'constantly', 'worried', 'family', 'same', 'time', 'further', 'away', 'Jason', 'solely', 'film', 'explaining', 'important', 'someone', 'document', 'what', 'happening', 'others', 'see', 'problem', 'so', 'doing', 'reality', 'him.The', 'film', 'move', 'steady', 'pace', 'group', 'everything', 'first', 'zombie', 'road', 'zombies', 'abandoned', 'hospital', 'reality', 'death', 'dead', 'rising', 'handled', 'own', 'way', 'survival', 'instinct', 'kick', 'overdrive', 'move', 'forward', 'watch', 'humans', 'decided', 'not', 'sit', 'take', 'move', 'forward', 'hope', 'something', 'somewhere', 'old', 'lives', 'remain', 'intact.Fans', 'series', 'films', 'Romero', 'made', 'know', 'up', 'front', 'zombie', 'invasion', 'will', 'change', 'things', 'zombies', 'make', 'up', 'low', 'percentage', 'walking', 'beginning', 'eventually', 'outnumber', 'living', 'time', 'last', 'film', 'LAND', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'took', 'place', 'What', 'see', 'here', 'precursor', 'what', 'come.Some', 'say', 'handheld', 'look', 'lacking', 'thought', 'added', 'story', 'made', 'statement', 'use', 'cameras', 'news', 'footage', 'kids', 'falling', 'off', 'skateboards', 'clips', 'online', 'People', 'take', 'picture', 'seek', 'only', 'entertainment', 'value', 'expense', 'others', 'do', 'detach', 'reality', 'sad', 'think', 'so', 'doing', 'drop', 'notch', 'down', 'evolutionary', 'scale.Romero', 'taken', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'lame', 'genre', 'filled', 'same', 'old', 'same', 'old', 'given', 'injection', 'something', 'new', 'film', 'own', 'well', 'series', 'started', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'same', 'man', 'share', 'scares', 'commentary', 'human', 'interests', 'seeing', 'over', 'again', 'first', 'time', 'interest', 'beginning', 'end']",N/A

1140883,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B0013D8LA4,Matthew King,"[4, 6]","""Diary of the Dead"" is the fifth installment in George Romero's zombie cannon which started off with 1968's genre-defining ""Night of the Living Dead"", was updated brilliantly and surpassed by the 1978 sequel ""Dawn of the Dead"", which was also nearly (but not quite) upstaged by 1985's excellent ""Day of the Dead"".  This trilogy proved that when it came to zombies, George could do no wrong.  In 2005 Romero returned with the 20 years in the waiting ""Land of the Dead"" a film, which was met with very mixed fan reaction.  I personally liked Land of the Dead and dug it for what it was.  We couldn't expect George to make movies look as though it was still 1985 could we?Story: In Diary, a group of college students from Pitt University flee from campus after a zombie outbreak.  They hit the road in a big hippy-style van so they can go back home and be with their (hopefully still alive?) loved ones.  One of the students named Jason decides to film all of the events and broadcast on-line for the world to see.  The film thus plays out as a sort of web-cam unfolding of events.My initial reaction on hearing about the premise of Romero's new zombie opus was not necessarily a negative one.  Sure, the shaky-camera, reality thing has been played out for years now but I gave Romero the benefit of the doubt because it wouldn't be the first time he reinvents himself through these films.  Although all of them are zombie films, ""Night"" is radically different from ""Dawn"" which is radically different from ""Land"".  So in Diary, Romero is not settling but continuing to reinvent himself.  But oh, how poorly this is executed!  Nearly everything in this film is an absolute mess.  The CGI head shots that make us crave for Tom Savini.  The dreadful ""social commentary"" about how we are now all a bunch of media-obsessed, blogging, self-promoters.  What a fine observation of modern culture George!  And the acting....the most frustrating part is not knowing if the atrocious wooden acting is due to a puke-poor cast or if Romero wanted it to look this way intentionally to play in with his ""reality"" concept.  I'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt George, but after watching this wreck I've given up all hope.Is this the worst movie ever?  Certainly not, there are heaps of b-horror trash way worse than this.  But one thing's for sure, this movie will never elicit repeat viewings the way Romero's other zombie films did.  Even those who liked this movie, I refuse to believe for one second that they would see the need to sit through this again for multiple viewings.  It's sad to think that throughout the nineties I kept hoping, praying, Romero would finally have the green light to make more zombie films.  Now?  I just want him to stop...One thing I've noticed reading through these reviews is that no one seems to be debating this simple point:  If Romero's name wasn't attached to this, would we have anyone defending this movie as being a ""masterpiece"" or have a single 5-star rating on this board?  No way, this would be discarded as a by-the-numbers 2-star zombie straight-to-DVD fodder and nothing more.

1140884,AVX4Y2CS2GCA0,B0013D8LA4,Matthew Schenk,"[3, 4]","First off I'm a huge George Romero and zombie fan, and had to at least see this movie one time. The premise sounded really cool (people documenting the zombie uprising using hand held cameras), but I was worried that it was going to be disappointing because of some of the reviews I'd read. A lot of people who liked Romero's other Dead movies didn't like this movie, saying that Romero was past his prime, that the acting and dialogue were bad, that it hit you over the head with its social commentary and it was preachy, and that there was annoying music and narration over the whole movie. I'm writing this review for the people like me who are fans of Romero and zombie movies but are put off by some of the reviews, and to tell them not to worry. This is a good movie.It's probably my third favorite after Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Land of the Dead (I liked this better than Day of the Dead). And yes it is flawed, but not as flawed as some of the reviews are saying, and I had an enjoyable time watching it. No, I'm not a Romero apologist either. Though I'm a fan of his Dead series he's made some clunkers too. I didn't really like Bruiser, for instance. I also like intelligent horror movies. I care more about telling a good story than I do about blood and guts and fast cuts.The narration which I thought I would hate doesn't actually run over the entire movie. I thought there would be this running monologue explaining what was going on as if we couldn't just watch the movie ourselves. But it's only every once in a while and it usually moves the story forward. For example, after a sequence is done the narrator might come on and say ""Over the next couple days we watched the story develop on the news..."", and as she's talking it'll show news clips of how the dead are taking over. She doesn't talk over any of the action or dialogue. In fact, I actually liked the narration. I thought the documentary style was what set this movie apart from Blair Witch and Cloverfield. I also didn't think it was preachy or heavy handed either. I thought it was ""just right"" and it added commentary to the movie.That said, there were a few times where the dialogue between the characters themselves got a little preachy, most noticeable in the hospital scene. And I thought sometimes the way they acted wasn't very realistic. For example, every time someone was in danger and Jason (the guy behind the camera) just stood there and kept filming. It gets explained later on that the media is distorting everything and that's why making this movie is so important to him, but still I didn't find it very realistic. Especially in the hospital scene where he's standing there waiting for his camera to recharge while he can hear his friends screaming in the background, and he's not even like ""hurry!"" And when they hear the first news reports at the beginning of the movie, everybody's just like ""oh, shouldn't we get out of here?"" If it were me I'd be glued to the TV like ""NO WAY! ZOMBIES?!?! Can this be REAL?!?!?""Also, the music is a little annoying because again it isn't very realistic. The narrator says she added music because ""I am trying to scare you...so maybe you don't repeat the mistakes we made."" What mistakes??? I would have been fine with music over the parts where the narrator cuts in and starts showing news clips of what's going on in the rest of the world, but it makes no sense to add music to the scenes where people are dying.Those are my only problems with the movie. And it may seem like a lot, but I thought the movie really took off in the second half and I was sitting on the edge of my seat and really getting into the story. I thought the movie was flawed and could have been a 5 star movie with some polishing, but on the whole I enjoyed it. There's voice cameos by Stephen King, Guillermo Del Toro, Simon Pegg, and Quentin Tarantino. There's references to Romero's earlier Dead movies. At one point in the movie, the characters are actually listening to the one of the news broadcasts from Night of the Living Dead. There's an intelligent commentary, some good looking zombies, it has elements from Romero's world like a gang of looters and corrupt officials, and this is the first Romero zombie movie where the characters are actually out in the open the entire movie, not boxed up somewhere with the zombies outside trying to get in.",4,"flawed, but very entertaining",1211241600,"05 20, 2008",2008,4389,"['First', 'off', ""'m"", 'huge', 'George', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'fan', 'had', 'least', 'see', 'movie', 'one', 'time', 'premise', 'sounded', 'really', 'cool', 'people', 'documenting', 'zombie', 'uprising', 'using', 'hand', 'held', 'cameras', 'was', 'worried', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'disappointing', 'reviews', ""'d"", 'read', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'liked', 'Romero', 'other', 'Dead', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'saying', 'Romero', 'was', 'prime', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'were', 'bad', 'hit', 'head', 'social', 'commentary', 'was', 'preachy', 'was', 'annoying', 'music', 'narration', 'whole', 'movie', ""'m"", 'writing', 'review', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'movies', 'are', 'put', 'off', 'reviews', 'tell', 'not', 'worry', 'good', 'movie.It', 'probably', 'third', 'favorite', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Land', 'Dead', 'liked', 'better', 'Day', 'Dead', 'yes', 'flawed', 'not', 'as', 'flawed', 'reviews', 'are', 'saying', 'had', 'enjoyable', 'time', 'watching', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'Romero', 'apologist', 'either', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Dead', 'series', 'made', 'clunkers', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'Bruiser', 'instance', 'also', 'like', 'intelligent', 'horror', 'movies', 'care', 'more', 'telling', 'good', 'story', 'do', 'blood', 'guts', 'fast', 'cuts.The', 'narration', 'thought', 'would', 'hate', ""n't"", 'actually', 'run', 'entire', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'running', 'monologue', 'explaining', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'watch', 'movie', 'only', 'once', 'while', 'usually', 'story', 'forward', 'example', 'sequence', 'done', 'narrator', 'might', 'come', 'say', 'next', 'couple', 'days', 'watched', 'story', 'develop', 'news', 'talking', ""'ll"", 'show', 'news', 'clips', 'how', 'dead', 'are', 'taking', 'over', ""n't"", 'talk', 'action', 'dialogue', 'fact', 'actually', 'liked', 'narration', 'thought', 'documentary', 'style', 'was', 'what', 'set', 'movie', 'apart', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Cloverfield', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'preachy', 'heavy', 'handed', 'either', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'added', 'commentary', 'movie.That', 'said', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'got', 'little', 'preachy', 'most', 'noticeable', 'hospital', 'scene', 'thought', 'sometimes', 'way', 'acted', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'realistic', 'example', 'time', 'someone', 'was', 'danger', 'Jason', 'guy', 'camera', 'just', 'stood', 'kept', 'filming', 'explained', 'later', 'media', 'distorting', 'everything', 'why', 'making', 'movie', 'so', 'important', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'very', 'realistic', 'Especially', 'hospital', 'scene', 'where', 'standing', 'there', 'waiting', 'camera', 'recharge', 'can', 'hear', 'friends', 'screaming', 'background', 'not', 'even', 'hurry', 'when', 'hear', 'first', 'news', 'reports', 'beginning', 'movie', 'everybody', 'just', 'oh', 'should', ""n't"", 'get', 'here', 'were', ""'d"", 'be', 'glued', 'TV', 'NO', 'WAY', 'ZOMBIES', 'Can', 'be', 'REAL', 'Also', 'music', 'little', 'annoying', 'again', ""n't"", 'very', 'realistic', 'narrator', 'added', 'music', 'am', 'trying', 'scare', 'so', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'mistakes', 'made', 'What', 'mistakes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'music', 'parts', 'where', 'narrator', 'cuts', 'showing', 'news', 'clips', 'what', 'going', 'rest', 'world', 'sense', 'add', 'music', 'scenes', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'dying.Those', 'are', 'only', 'problems', 'movie', 'may', 'seem', 'lot', 'thought', 'movie', 'really', 'took', 'off', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat', 'really', 'getting', 'story', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'flawed', 'could', 'have', 'been', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'polishing', 'whole', 'enjoyed', 'voice', 'cameos', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Guillermo', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'references', 'Romero', 'earlier', 'Dead', 'movies', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'listening', 'one', 'news', 'broadcasts', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'intelligent', 'commentary', 'good', 'looking', 'zombies', 'elements', 'Romero', 'world', 'gang', 'looters', 'corrupt', 'officials', 'first', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'movie', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'out', 'open', 'entire', 'movie', 'not', 'boxed', 'up', 'somewhere', 'zombies', 'trying', 'get']",N/A

B Cole ""Kegrun""","[24, 33]","When a friend comes up to you and tells you he has something for you but the only way you're going to get it before he watches it, is for you to rub his feet and suck on his big toe, you just know he has something good. I laughed and asked him ""Come on man... just tell me what it is."" He tells me, ""I got a copy of Diary of the Dead...sup.""After gargling some mouthwash and wiping my mouth, I stuck Diary of the Dead into my laptop with Zombie glee pouring out my brraaaainnnss. The film begins with one of the best opening scenes to a zombie movie in my opinion. A new cast is filming a gruesome murder scene, to only witness the dead rise and begin to attack. When the lady zombie gets up, you can see her eyes fixated on the camera man from the start, but he's looking at another zombie mainly and sometimes you can see the female getting closer and then BAM in your face. And she looks wicked thanks to the zombie makeup that does not go over the top.We then come across some college students (our main attraction) who are filming what I'm pretty sure is a low budget Mummy movie. During a break to fix makeup, they learn about how the dead are rising. Whether it's real or not, everyone decides to go home. Two head to the `Mummy's' house (more like mansion), the rest decide to go get the director's g/f and then everyone at once head to their parents houses which are, thankfully, on the way to someone else's parents house. While on the road, they are basically safe, but it's during the stops that the troubles begin.The story was great and the zombies were fantastic. I can see what Romero was doing here and I totally enjoyed it, but there were things that just really bothered me about the movie and I'll got into a little detail for them1. The acting was atrocious. The movie is supposed to be filmed like a documentary, but the acting seemed like acting. None of it had a real feel to me. I saw actors, trying to act like, they weren't acting. And bad acting doesn't bother me, it's just the fact that it kept taking me out of what I was supposed to be feeling, and that was that I was watching a documentary.2. The camera. The documentary feel doesn't bother me. I liked how Cloverfied was filmed because I KNEW that it was supposed to FEEL like a documentary. And that's what it felt like. This though felt more staged. To me Diary felt more like a videogame the way it was filmed. Like I was watching a rail camera.. It felt like HUD was actually behind the camera in Cloverfield. Jason Creed, well, he felt more like a camera machine and not a human. Yeah I'm sure this helped a lot with the shaky camera problem that a lot of people hated about Clovefield and made them run out to get Dramamine pills for, but it took away from the REALNESS that I believe Romero wanted for the movie. What I meant about the rail camera above was that it felt like certain scenes were choreographed to give us a scare or put action into the scene. Sure I know ALL scenes in ALL movies are choreographed, but they don't FEEL like it. Hopefully you get what I'm saying, I might be having trouble trying to explain it.3. CG was used. I couldn't believe this. On little things such as gunshots to the head cg was used. Blood splatter from the back of the head was CG. That really pissed me off cause I hate when CG is used for things that special effects artists can CLEARLY make look better with actual real life blood packets and whatever other cool gadgets they got. There was one scene where the CG was used correctly and looked really good and it involved acid. Sure we've seen acid scenes before with make-up effects or whatever, but this looked really good. But it doesn't make up for the other countless CG effects that could've been easily done the good old fashioned way.4. The editing on some scenes made me scratch my head in befuddlement. I get the fact that Romero is giving us a lesson on how we are using camera, phone cameras, whatever else is out there gadget wise, to film everything around us now. But I don't need that to ruin a good scene for me. In one part, the Winnebago the crew is driving, runs over a group of zombies. Well right when we are getting ready to see a nice scene, the camera switches over to one of the camera phones somebody was using. So we don't get the good sound or video we were witnessing. It goes to a very crappy looking and sounding shot of these zombies getting run over. I was pissed at that.In the end, I get the message. The media. The constant updating of OUR lives. The youtubes and MySpaces. The car wreck syndrome. The `not really being there feel' when you are behind the camera. I get it. But when I'm watching a zombie movie, I'm watching it for the zombies first and..well..second. The message can go in there somewhere also, but I REALLY could care less. I want my carnage. I want my blood. I want my gore. I want my feel of hopelessness. I got what I wanted, but I honestly think Romero could've done better. Will I watch this again? Hell yes. It's better than a LOT of the zombie movies out now. I will own it also and spend the extra dough on the blu-ray version as well. I think EVERYONE should at least rent it and give it a try. Just don't going in it's going to be blockbuster quality because it's just not... in my opinion.To my zombie and gore friends, please don't hate me for giving this 3 stars... lol. I just have to rate it how I feel.P.S. The scene looking out of the barn via the camera was very cool looking.",3,I just saw my dead grandma chew a mans face off on YouTube man!,1210118400,"05 7, 2008",2008,5488,"['When', 'friend', 'up',

Yes, there is the trademark ""they're coming to get you, Barbara"" undercurrent that runs through all of Romero's zombie flicks.But you need to watch the extras on the DVD, specifically the one in which Romero discusses the film and the fact that he's ""not sure"" how the audience will respond to it. The predecessor, ""Land of the Dead,"" was a major studio (Universal), relatively big-budget film. ""Diary"" isn't, and Romero freely admits this. He says that there are ""fewer zombies, but maybe if the zombies we have are really good that will be OK.""I found it hard to get behind the ""college students video taping the zombie crisis"" central plot line. And face it, if the ""hook"" doesn't hook you, you either find other things to appreciate in the movie or you turn in a one-star review.I gave it three stars because it's Romero, because I applaud the fact that while he makes some mis-steps he never takes the easy way out or attempts to rubber-stamp his past victories.It is an ""OK"" movie. It's not a ""great"" one, but it's not as bad as some people might lead you to believe. That final scene is a little closer to the twisted ""shock"" gore that Herschell Gordon Lewis might have produced in his prime (and I don't offer that as a compliment...Lewis ventured to areas of the human psyche that might have been better left off of film).Romero will probably surface again, and his next film might be better or worse than ""Diary of the Dead.""

The viewer goes to the horror film to be horrified.Television news programs survive on scares as well.  For example video news releases disguised as the news playing during our local news every night telling us more vitamin C is what we need meanwhile that video news release was being paid for by an orange juice company.  A more specific example, ""between 1990 and 1998, when the nation's murder rate declined by 20 percent, the number of murder stories on network newscasts increased 600 percent (not counting stories about O.J. Simpson) (Glassner, 1998).Auteur director Romero in Diary of the Dead uses these misleading tactics in reverse.  Romero gives viewers a social critique of the media in the form of a horror film much like the media gives you the news disguised as a horror film to get ratings.The main character, during apocalyptic chaos while zombies kill his friends finds a purpose and that is to get the truth to the people even if that means dying for his cause so the public will know the truth.  His belief for his cause does not die with him but is picked up by his friend and continued.There are so many ads being thrown at us at all times how do we know what to consume?  To use film as an example if you just went to your local suburban movie theater you wouldn't discover anything except for Oscar time when it seems a movie might make money.  So, we film lovers dig and find a critic we like, a critic suggests a book or a magazine, that magazine leads us to a website, and we find a network of inspiring art if were lucky and it takes work.  For example, I wish there was an IMDB for music or everything in life that could lead me to one place then another of interest.  Singers sing about materialistic things and rappers rap about a gold plated bathtub.  We live in a time of upheaval there are so many causes to get behind but we aren't going to find it on MTV when this singer ""idol"" does the next Revlon commercial.  I'm sure a rapper could find something to rhyme with foreclosure, unemployment, war, recession, depression, see I just did it.  There are many inspiring singers and rappers out there if you work hard you can find some but we the people have to want it and not buy the pre digested garbage.Romero's film tackles these issues if you're willing to dig for them.Glassner, B.

Leaving behind the Blockbuster feel ofLand of the Dead, Romero has gone back to the simplicity ofNight of the Living Deadand he did it well. I have been looking forward to this movie, but with apprehension; was it going to be a sell out likeLand of the Dead? No, it is the opposite. Romero uses great actors, but relatively new to the movie scene, for this movie which makes the movie fresh and seem more original. The cinematography was a breath of fresh air, as it allowed us to follow these characters in somewhat ""real time"", without the edited feel to all of it.The movie goes back to when it all began and tells the story through a group of film students in the initial stages of the zombie outbreak. The gore in the film is top-notch and splendid. The defibrillator scene is especially good.Romero also brilliantly explains why zombies are slow, why they don't run: their knees would give out. Take that running and wall jumping and climbing zombies! (The newDay of the Dead) Let Romero show you how it's done! This movie is nothing short of great, Romero uses a fresh take to cinematography in his movies, new faces, and a very good script. The result is a really good movie that deals, in Romero fashion, with the current issues of society: war, immigration, distrust in the military, chaos, the ""not knowing"", 9/11 and many more.Dawn of the Dead is the best of Romero's movies. It shows a maturity in dealing with the issues that rivals the simiplicity ofNight of the Living Dead. Diary of the Dead is a mix between the two. It goes back the simiplicity of Night of the Living Dead but deals with the issues much likeDawn of the Dead.Listen for Stephen King, Simon Pegg and Guillermo Del Toro as the voiceovers of the news.

Despite its flaws, I enjoyed Land of the Dead for what it was, and I looked forward to Diary of the Dead, even though I wasn't too thrilled about hearing of the documentary/first person view film style that The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield have made famous.  However, I figured if anyone could pull it off to any great effect, it would be Romero.  Sadly, Diary of the Dead ends up being a zombie film that would be great for any other director, but considering this is from the godfather of the zombie genre, it ends up being disappointing.  Following a crew of would-be film makers, Diary of the Dead gives a first person view of a zombie outbreak, and the chaos and carnage that follows.  Now Romero is no stranger to injecting social and even political commentary into his zombie flicks amongst all the blood and guts, and he does to decent enough effect, but it felt kind of overdone.  The cast, which is far from convincing, didn't do too much better, especially in a flick that is going for the documentary type of feel.  As previous reviewers have stated, they didn't come off as natural at all, and just as actors, which would be fine if this were any other type of film.  Also disappointing is the gore factor, most of which is now done by CGI effects.  They're good, but (and this is the zombie nut in me) there isn't enough of it.  Where Diary of the Dead works is that there are some moments of genuine suspense, the story is harrowing enough, and the film ends up being enjoyable for what it is.  All in all, Diary of the Dead could have been better than what we get, and while some will love it and some will definitely hate it, it is what it is, and it is a worthwhile trip for Romero and zombie fans.",3,Slightly disappointing,1211500800,"05 23, 2008",2008,1824,"['love', 'George', 'Romero', 'as', 'well', 'majority', 'films', 'Dead', 'films', 'being', 'highlights', 'flaws', 'enjoyed', 'Land', 'Dead', 'what', 'was', 'looked', 'forward', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'thrilled', 'hearing', 'documentary/first', 'person', 'view', 'film', 'style', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Cloverfield', 'have', 'made', 'famous', 'However', 'figured', 'anyone', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'great', 'effect', 'would', 'be', 'Romero', 'Sadly', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'up', 'being', 'zombie', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'other', 'director', 'considering', 'godfather', 'zombie', 'genre', 'up', 'being', 'disappointing', 'Following', 'crew', 'would-be', 'film', 'makers', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'first', 'person', 'view', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'chaos', 'carnage', 'Now', 'Romero', 'stranger', 'injecting', 'social', 'even', 'political', 'commentary', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'amongst', 'blood', 'guts', 'decent', 'enough', 'effect', 'felt', 'kind', 'overdone', 'cast', 'far', 'convincing', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'much', 'better', 'especially', 'flick', 'going', 'documentary', 'type', 'feel', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'natural', 'just', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'fine', 'were', 'other', 'type', 'film', 'Also', 'disappointing', 'gore', 'factor', 'most', 'now', 'done', 'CGI', 'effects', ""'re"", 'good', 'zombie', 'nut', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Where', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'works', 'are', 'moments', 'genuine', 'suspense', 'story', 'harrowing', 'enough', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'enjoyable', 'what', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'what', 'get', 'will', 'love', 'will', 'definitely', 'hate', 'what', 'worthwhile', 'trip', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'fans']",N/A

Acosta,"[1, 3]","Not to date myself, but I clearly recall the day I had begged my parents to rent me this little movie on VHS called 'Night of the Living Dead' back when there was no sell thru pricing and if you wanted to buy a film they were like 90 bucks. So of course I made a copy of it from VCR to VCR and I watched the movie so many times I warped the tape. And since then  Mr. Romero has never disappointed me.  Though my favorite of his Flesh eating masterpieces (and one of my favorite films period) still continues to be Day of the Dead, I really enjoyed Diary immensely hence, why I give it a perfect score. While I don't give the acting a perfect score, and there are times when certain bouts of dialog are painful to listen to, the overall atmosphere the movie creates, with it's faux documentary style and it's various current pop culture references, is quite unique and engaging. From the very beginning, with the immigrant zombies to it's sudden finale, this movie will take you for one sweet, zombie infested joy ride if you just let it. I did see opportunities for the movie to really be more allegorical and with this push more on the boundaries of political correctness. more gore would've been nice also (not that the movie lacks gore I'm just a bit glutinous when it comes to violence in horror). Too many films these days, even horror, are afraid to really be socially challenging and transgression al and instead opt for a safer approach. The whole immigrant angle in the beginning, for example, would've been fun to explore. But then again one can always add their two cents to any film no matter how great and it wouldn't take away from it. Even the acting, to me, doesn't take away from the experience. So on the experience, which is why we watch movies in the first place, I rate it 5 stars. A prefect way to spend 96 minutes of your life. And if you're new to the wonderful world of George Romero ( I figure AMC's 'The Walking Dead' series will create more interest in the genre) be sure to check out Day of Dead, Dawn of the Dead (The Argento cut I like the best), Land of the Dead, Survival of the Dead and...Don't forget the one that started it all ; Night of the Living Dead (just not the 30th anniversary one).And if you found this useful please email me a comment at : tenseicoalition@gmail.com",5,You just can't go wrong with a Romero zombie flick!,1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,2312,"['Not', 'date', 'clearly', 'recall', 'day', 'had', 'begged', 'parents', 'rent', 'little', 'movie', 'VHS', 'called', ""'Night"", 'Living', 'Dead', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'sell', 'thru', 'pricing', 'wanted', 'buy', 'film', 'were', '90', 'bucks', 'So', 'course', 'made', 'copy', 'VCR', 'VCR', 'watched', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'warped', 'tape', 'then', 'Mr.', 'Romero', 'never', 'disappointed', 'favorite', 'Flesh', 'eating', 'masterpieces', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'period', 'still', 'be', 'Day', 'Dead', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Diary', 'immensely', 'hence', 'why', 'give', 'perfect', 'score', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'acting', 'perfect', 'score', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'certain', 'bouts', 'dialog', 'are', 'painful', 'listen', 'overall', 'movie', 'faux', 'documentary', 'style', 'various', 'current', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'quite', 'unique', 'engaging', 'very', 'beginning', 'immigrant', 'zombies', 'sudden', 'finale', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'one', 'sweet', 'zombie', 'infested', 'joy', 'ride', 'just', 'let', 'did', 'see', 'opportunities', 'movie', 'really', 'be', 'more', 'allegorical', 'push', 'more', 'boundaries', 'political', 'correctness', 'more', 'gore', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'also', 'not', 'movie', 'gore', ""'m"", 'just', 'bit', 'glutinous', 'when', 'violence', 'horror', 'Too', 'many', 'films', 'days', 'even', 'horror', 'are', 'afraid', 'really', 'be', 'socially', 'challenging', 'transgression', 'al', 'instead', 'opt', 'safer', 'approach', 'whole', 'immigrant', 'angle', 'beginning', 'example', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fun', 'explore', 'then', 'again', 'one', 'can', 'always', 'add', 'two', 'cents', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'great', 'would', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'Even', 'acting', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'experience', 'So', 'experience', 'why', 'watch', 'movies', 'first', 'place', 'rate', '5', 'stars', 'prefect', 'way', 'spend', '96', 'minutes', 'life', ""'re"", 'new', 'wonderful', 'world', 'George', 'Romero', 'figure', 'AMC', ""'The"", 'Walking', 'Dead', 'series', 'will', 'create', 'more', 'interest', 'genre', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'Day', 'Dead', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Argento', 'cut', 'best', 'Land', 'Dead', 'Survival', 'Dead', 'Do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'one', 'started', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'just', 'not', '30th', 'anniversary', 'one', 'found', 'useful', 'please', 'email', 'comment', 'tenseicoalition', 'gmail.com']",N/A
1140904,ANZUZTIBMGK4S,B0013D8LA4,"Poe the Ghost ""George""","[3, 3]","I've always loved George A. Romero's zombie movies, dating back to when I first saw Night of the Living Dead (90's version) when I was just a kid.I remember that I loved the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, then I saw the original version and loved it even more!Night of the Living Dead & Dawn of the Dead set a standard for zombie movies that cannot be surpassed. Perhaps that's why Diary of the Dead comes up a bit short...Diary of the Dead was a good zombie movie, and worthy of mention as one of George A. Romero's movies. However, that's just it... Diary of the Dead is good, just ""good"" not Great. The movie keeps you feeling tense throughout, (just as Romero's earlier movies did) yet this one has some issues.First of all, the acting isn't so great... While some of the characters are portrayed quite well by their actors, some of them are so bad that you feel like you're watching A Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie, and that's where Diary of the Dead suffers most.Next, while the new through-the-lens Documentary-like style of the movie is a fresh approach to the Dead series, and it's realistic how the main character constantly has to recharge the battery in his camera, (unlike the everlasting battery from Cloverfield) it just feels too different from the other Dead movies.Furthermore, Diary of the Dead really has no place in the Dead series. It's not a sequel, nor is it a prequel to any of Romero's earlier movies. One could make the arguement that it's set before the events in Night of the Living Dead, but unless they remake it again, that wouldn't make any sense. This plot of Diary of the Dead is set in modern times, there are cell phones, camcorders, and internet access in the world of Diary of the Dead. The last Night of the Living Dead movie was made in the 90's, yet it really didn't have anything in it to suggest that the happening in the movie took place anytime after the 1960's, so to claim that Diary of the Dead took place before Night of the Living Dead wouldn't fit with the timeline.And lastly, the special effects aren't as good as the 90's remake of Night of the Living Dead, or the original version of Dawn of the Dead, why? Because Tom Savini, the guy who did the special effects for both the 90's remake of Night of the Living Dead & the original Dawn of the Dead was not part of the special effects crew for Diary of the Dead. One of the reason's why 90's Night & the original Dawn of the Dead had such realistic special effects is because Tom Savini was a war photographer in the Vietnam war, but for some reason he wasn't part of the Special Effects crew of this movie.On a side note, I live in PA, and my college student friends don't drop the F-bomb nearly as casually as the characters in this movie do.The stereotype that all us young whipper-snappers are so found of using the F word is blown way out of proportion in movies today, and Diary of the Day has fallen prey to it.The Verdict: Good zombie movie by George A. Romero, but that's about it...

1140905,AXV9GS0TMSVW,B0013D8LA4,Poor Napoleon,"[0, 2]","George Romero has insisted time and again that this was a back to basics approach of independent film making.  Yet, Romero has rarely strayed from his original formula - low budget, little known actors, plenty of scares.  The difference with prior ""dead"" movies though is that this resets the story, playing it out against modern technology, politics, and perhaps cynicism regarding the powers that be.""Diary"" takes something of a ""Blair Witch"" approach to its story.  The film is narrated by Debra, one of the survivors from the group of students we encounter at the beginning of the film.  The film within the film is basically what we are watching.  It is shot by a film student named Jason Creed, played by Joshua Close, who sounds uncomfortably like Crispin Glover.  Jason doesn't know what's going on, but if it's something big, he wants to get it on tape.The film is political allegory, like all of Romero's zombie films.  There is hysteria around the nation and the media isn't quick to show us what is really going on.  The nation raises the terror level, but isn't saying why.  People are quick to get in touch with family and friends to see if they're ok, in spite of the uncertainty about what is happening around them.  Romero's political subtext is more obvious than his previous outings almost to a fault.  It's all over this film.  It can seem a little preachy, but it does work.  There is a great quote in the film, stating that if it doesn't happen on camera, then who's to say it actually happened, which although is obvious, does assess our obsession with media in regards to tragedy and hysteria.Another ubiquitous feature of the film is technology.  It's something that didn't exist in Night of the Living Dead.  The internet changes things.  Romero wisely shows how the immediacy of information among communities effects things.  In Night of the Living Dead, people were fixated on a black and white TV.  They had to believe what was dished out to them by television personalities.  Now, of course, we can get information from miles away from people we know.While Romero's points are poignant, they can get to be a little much.  It seems that we are getting things shoved in our face rather than receiving the subtle contexts of Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead, where the themes unravel in the closing.  In Diary, it feels like Romero has to keep reminding us of his message, as if we can't figure it out on our own.  Also, while the casting of unknowns is smart, the talent leaves much to be desired, detracting from the brilliant way the film is shot.Still, Diary is a heck of a lot smarter than the slew of horror films released today.

The last dead flick LAND was preempted by a more trigger happy remake of his brilliant DAWN OF THE DEAD, getting to his idea of the DEAD RECKONING vehicle first.  Beside all the financial BS he has undergone from the 1st NOTLDs oversight with the copyright, he is now beaten to the punch by other 1st person narrative ""reality"" films like CLOVERFIELD.The thing is none of that matters this time as Romero is back in form with a meaty culturally skewed tale that fits right into the series and reflects our times perfectly.  The ego/importance of the documentarian, the overexposure of home video, and the general uncertainty of the times we live in are explored deftly within the confines of a good old fashion horror flick.This is entertaining thought provoking, and gory as it should be with the best final scene of any of the DEAD pictures.  It wasn't quite what I expected and other than the common sense lack of a certain zombie killing near the end Diary fits right in with Night, DAWN, DAY, & yes LAND as some of the more socially relevant and impactful horror films of all time.

Most of his non zombie efforts through the 70's and 80's were somewhat memorable, None were truly remarkable, but good efforts. His last two most recent efforts fail simply because George Romero forgot the simple formula that made 'Night of the living dead', 'Dawn of the dead, and 'Day of the dead', so well appreciated. Those films offered some of the most shocking and terrifying sequences ever committed to film. The first two dead films in the series worked so well due to their shock value, and offered audiences a new level of fear factor and gore than had ever been seen before.That is much of the reason those two films are classics. This latest effort covers no new ground. In fact it clearly rips off the 'Blair witch project' without shame. The idea was good, and Romero should have been able to do it well. However much of the film is dedicated to trying to convince the audience that the use of cameras by the actual characters in the film was a reasonable possibility that might very well happen in real life. The harder the film tries to justify the use of the cameras, the more ridiculous it all seems.Some situations are so silly that I found myself saying ""Omg you have got to be kidding. No way in hell. This is so stupid"". Much of the gore is reasonably well done but under par for what we have come to expect in many recent horror films, and under par for even Romero's achievements. Never does it truly astound until the very last shot right before the credits. That was truly an astounding shot as far as gore goes. And if the entire film was filled with the same level of creative gore it would have possibly been the next step in a new direction of truly astonishing gore. Sometimes the film is so bad it's just plain stupid.

However, Day of the Dead is no longer the weakest link in the ""Of the Dead"" franchise. Not even close. We were considering purchasing ""Diary"" without watching it first, thinking, ""It's George Romero. How can we go wrong?"" Suffice to say, we are glad we didn't purchase that DVD.The idea is simple: college students filming a horror movie get thrown into a real one. However, whatever merit the original idea had gets sidelined by the absolute horror of the script, the screenplay, and the acting.To follow are spoilers:Let's get this out of the way first: you can't edit your video during the zombie apocalypse. And you don't edit music into a movie in which your significant other dies. Part of the beauty of other first-person movies like The Blair Witch and Cloverfield was their complete lack of music or editing... well, not quite complete in both cases, but neither had music or, God help us all, voiceover. The voiceover by the female lead was monotone, it was trite, and it was quite bad. Any movie that relies on voiceover to accomplish its aims, whether it be a moral message or simply a scare, will fall to its knees(the best example of this was Lynch's Dune).With this said, you'd think that at least the script or the acting would make up for it.... but it doesn't. The actors say exactly what they are thinking whenever they think it. The script is full of meaningless, cringeworthy lines. Whoever wrote this movie needs to learn the value of silence in a horror movie. Filling the silence is not always a good thing.All this would be redeemed, as in Day of the Dead, if the movie had some serious gore! However, it doesn't. There is an incident with a farmer, but that is about it. The zombie on the gurney spilling its guts out is done once again, after being done in Day of. It seems as if they ran out of on hand cash for special effects, however that's another issue - what's with the CGI gore? The acid on the head CGI was absolutely atrocious, and completely unbelievable. Most of the gore was computer generated, and it showed. Advice to the producers: stick with the makeup artists. They served you well.Basically, this movie had some promise in an abstract sense, but failed to deliver. It had no subtlety, no gore, and no acting. The narration, music, and fortuitous editing sealed the coffin, but this one ain't waking up any time soon.We will never again watch this movie, unlike the rest of the Of The Dead franchise which have an honored position on our DVD stand.",1,"Good Idea, Horribly Executed",1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,2583,"['wife', 'own', 'George', 'Romero', 'Dead', 'movies', 'including', 'Day', 'Dead', 'However', 'Day', 'Dead', 'no', 'longer', 'weakest', 'link', 'Dead', 'franchise', 'Not', 'even', 'close', 'were', 'considering', 'purchasing', 'Diary', 'watching', 'first', 'thinking', 'George', 'Romero', 'How', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'Suffice', 'say', 'are', 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'DVD.The', 'idea', 'simple', 'college', 'students', 'filming', 'horror', 'movie', 'get', 'thrown', 'real', 'one', 'However', 'merit', 'original', 'idea', 'had', 'sidelined', 'absolute', 'horror', 'script', 'screenplay', 'acting.To', 'follow', 'are', 'spoilers', 'Let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'first', 'ca', ""n't"", 'edit', 'video', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'do', ""n't"", 'edit', 'music', 'movie', 'significant', 'other', 'dies', 'Part', 'beauty', 'other', 'first-person', 'movies', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Cloverfield', 'was', 'complete', 'lack', 'music', 'editing', 'well', 'not', 'quite', 'complete', 'cases', 'had', 'music', 'God', 'voiceover', 'voiceover', 'female', 'lead', 'was', 'monotone', 'was', 'trite', 'was', 'quite', 'bad', 'movie', 'voiceover', 'accomplish', 'aims', 'be', 'moral', 'message', 'simply', 'scare', 'will', 'fall', 'knees', 'best', 'example', 'was', 'Lynch', 'Dune', '.With', 'said', ""'d"", 'think', 'least', 'script', 'acting', 'would', 'make', 'up', ""n't"", 'actors', 'say', 'exactly', 'what', 'are', 'thinking', 'think', 'script', 'full', 'meaningless', 'cringeworthy', 'lines', 'Whoever', 'wrote', 'movie', 'learn', 'value', 'silence', 'horror', 'movie', 'Filling', 'silence', 'not', 'always', 'good', 'thing.All', 'would', 'be', 'redeemed', 'Day', 'Dead', 'movie', 'had', 'serious', 'gore', 'However', ""n't"", 'incident', 'farmer', 'zombie', 'gurney', 'spilling', 'guts', 'out', 'done', 'once', 'again', 'being', 'done', 'Day', 'ran', 'hand', 'cash', 'special', 'effects', 'however', 'issue', 'what', 'CGI', 'gore', 'acid', 'head', 'CGI', 'was', 'absolutely', 'atrocious', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'Most', 'gore', 'was', 'computer', 'generated', 'showed', 'Advice', 'producers', 'stick', 'makeup', 'artists', 'served', 'well.Basically', 'movie', 'had', 'promise', 'abstract', 'sense', 'failed', 'deliver', 'had', 'subtlety', 'gore', 'acting', 'narration', 'music', 'fortuitous', 'editing', 'sealed', 'coffin', 'one', 'ai', ""n't"", 'waking', 'up', 'time', 'soon.We', 'will', 'never', 'again', 'watch', 'movie', 'rest', 'Dead', 'franchise', 'have', 'honored', 'position', 'DVD', 'stand']",N/A

He is responsible for the original Night of the Living Dead, and Tom Savini's remake, the original Dawn of the Dead, the original Day of the Dead, and Land of the Dead. He has returned to his independent filming roots with his latest outing Diary of the Dead.Like all of his past Dead films, Romero has chosen an issue that is happening in the world while he was writing his latest Dead film. The phenomenon he has chosen to criticize was the media.You can watch Fox News and get the Republican spun version or CNN and get the Democratic spun version of the exact same news story. You can read one newspaper and it will tell you that our country has economically fallen, and another will tell you that things are not as bad as they seem. Newspapers describe the Swine Flu as a pandemic, yet the traditional flu is still a much higher death threat then the new strain.The media has the power to influence the way we think and live our lives. So, who do we trust? Do we trust the corporate government run media or do we trust each other, ""the little people"" who blog on My Space, You Tube, Face Book, and other internet websites?Romero's Diary of the Dead is an exercise in showing just how the news you watch every night can take a story and manipulate it either to the standards of the government run corporation it works for or a political agenda.In this film, ""the news"" tries to tell everyone that everything is going to be okay, however, Jason's camera and recording show the painful truth of a very different reality. Is Fox News and CNN really trustworthy, or should we just count on nobody but ourselves and each other? After you have watched Romero's Diary of the Dead, you will ask yourself the same question.As a film itself, it is a little low on zombie and gore action, but the gore that it does have is definitely Day of the Dead quality make-up effects that are absolutely disgusting. The film was shot in the perspective of a hand held camera to sell the plot of a character documenting true life events. It is a very scary and suspenseful film, because reality is untrustworthy. You never know what is going to happen in reality until it does. The zombies' make-up is top notch. This film is a scary and exiting adventure of a group of people just trying to survive the beginning of the end of the world.This film is not as violent as past Romero Dead films, as it focuses more on tension and the characters, but the gore it does have is relentless. This is George A. Romero, taking his zombies into an original idea, on the budget of a low budget horror film. This is a very smart horror film. You can expect suspense, tension, and gore, but it is also a smart film with a lot of social commentary on media manipulation. You really need to watch this film twice. Watch it the first time to enjoy the horror aspects of it, yet watch it a second time to really take in all of the satirical story elements.",4,Intelligence of the Dead,1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,2985,"['George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'legendary', 'horror', 'film', 'maker', 'dead', 'responsible', 'original', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Tom', 'Savini', 'remake', 'original', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'original', 'Day', 'Dead', 'Land', 'Dead', 'returned', 'independent', 'filming', 'roots', 'latest', 'outing', 'Diary', 'Dead.Like', 'past', 'Dead', 'films', 'Romero', 'chosen', 'issue', 'happening', 'world', 'was', 'writing', 'latest', 'Dead', 'film', 'phenomenon', 'chosen', 'criticize', 'was', 'media.You', 'can', 'watch', 'Fox', 'News', 'get', 'Republican', 'spun', 'version', 'CNN', 'get', 'Democratic', 'spun', 'version', 'exact', 'same', 'news', 'story', 'can', 'read', 'one', 'newspaper', 'will', 'tell', 'country', 'economically', 'fallen', 'will', 'tell', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'seem', 'Newspapers', 'describe', 'Swine', 'Flu', 'pandemic', 'traditional', 'flu', 'still', 'much', 'higher', 'death', 'threat', 'then', 'new', 'strain.The', 'media', 'power', 'influence', 'way', 'think', 'live', 'lives', 'So', 'who', 'do', 'trust', 'Do', 'trust', 'corporate', 'government', 'run', 'media', 'do', 'trust', 'other', 'little', 'people', 'who', 'blog', 'My', 'Space', 'Tube', 'Face', 'Book', 'other', 'internet', 'websites', 'Romero', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'exercise', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'news', 'watch', 'night', 'can', 'take', 'story', 'manipulate', 'standards', 'government', 'run', 'corporation', 'political', 'agenda.In', 'film', 'news', 'tries', 'tell', 'everyone', 'everything', 'going', 'be', 'okay', 'however', 'Jason', 'camera', 'recording', 'show', 'painful', 'truth', 'very', 'different', 'reality', 'Fox', 'News', 'CNN', 'really', 'trustworthy', 'should', 'just', 'count', 'nobody', 'ourselves', 'other', 'have', 'watched', 'Romero', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'will', 'ask', 'same', 'question.As', 'film', 'little', 'low', 'zombie', 'gore', 'action', 'gore', 'have', 'definitely', 'Day', 'Dead', 'quality', 'make-up', 'effects', 'are', 'absolutely', 'disgusting', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'perspective', 'hand', 'held', 'camera', 'sell', 'plot', 'character', 'documenting', 'true', 'life', 'events', 'very', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'reality', 'untrustworthy', 'never', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'reality', 'zombies', 'make-up', 'top', 'notch', 'film', 'scary', 'exiting', 'adventure', 'group', 'people', 'just', 'trying', 'survive', 'beginning', 'end', 'world.This', 'film', 'not', 'as', 'violent', 'past', 'Romero', 'Dead', 'films', 'more', 'tension', 'characters', 'gore', 'have', 'relentless', 'George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'taking', 'zombies', 'original', 'idea', 'budget', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'film', 'very', 'smart', 'horror', 'film', 'can', 'expect', 'suspense', 'tension', 'gore', 'also', 'smart', 'film', 'lot', 'social', 'commentary', 'media', 'manipulation', 'really', 'need', 'watch', 'film', 'twice', 'Watch', 'first', 'time', 'enjoy', 'horror', 'aspects', 'yet', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'really', 'take', 'satirical', 'story', 'elements']",N/A

1140915,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0013D8LA4,RMurray847,"[3, 4]","George Romero has returned to his ultra-low budget roots with DIARY OF THE DEAD.  For most, it will be a welcome return.  While there were many parts of his ""big budget"" LAND OF THE DEAD that I enjoyed...frankly, having known actors and high production values just took something away from the nastiness factor of NIGHT, DAWN and DAY OF THE DEAD.  That shudder of realizing you're watching something distasteful and compelling at the same time.Much of that feeling returns in this newest film.  No doubt Romero simply couldn't raise the money again after the box office failure of LAND...but he may have relished a chance to display his filmmaking chops in a manner similar to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.In a way, this movie is a reboot.  It takes us back to the time when the zombie outbreak (in case you don't know...the dead are coming back to life to ""feast on the flesh of the living."") is just starting.  But now it is set in our time.  Digital video is everywhere, as is access to the internet.  In fact, the entire film is supposed to be a hastily edited video from one of the survivors...because various members of their party have been filming the events of those horrific first days of the ""plague.""  So, yes, it has a very BLAIR WITCH / CLOVERFIELD feeling to it.  While I still don't mind this jumpy, ""amateur"" style of filmmaking if its done well, occasionally I couldn't help thinking how unoriginal this type of movie was becoming...and realizing that it won't be long before filmmakers won't be able to get away with it.  It's a gimmick.Much of the movie is seen through the lens of Jason, a film student who simply cannot bring himself to stop recording the events, even when setting down his camera to help his friends might be a ""good"" thing to do.  Romero gets around this by actually having the various characters (especially Jason's increasingly bitter girlfriend Deb) criticize and comment on Jason's obsession.  We also see the cast downloading videos that others are spreading around the world in an effort to show ""the truth"" of what's happening, because official government reports are clearly watered-down edits of the truth.Some reviews have praised the social commentary of the film...and the DEAD movies have always had a little element of social commentary in them.  But they are at their most clumsy in DIARY, because the characters literally spout social commentary.  Romero seems to think we can't understand his commentary just by viewing the actions of his characters.  So it becomes a clumsy commentary...especially in the hands of these unknown and frankly, marginally skilled actors.  As always, the acting leaves a lot to be desired...Romero just doesn't seem that interested.  So as we follow around this group of college film students and their professor, they become increasingly annoying because they are generally written and acted in an unconvincing manner.But luckily there are good things too.  The basic premise of these films...that our dead are coming back and killing the living, who also come back with an all-consuming interest in eating living people...always works.  Danny Boyle tackled similar stuff with 28 DAYS LATER.  Others have certainly done ""zombie"" films...including the truly excellent Zach Snyder DAWN OF THE DEAD remake...but NO ONE DOES THE GORE LIKE ROMERO!  He ups the ante yet again in this film, with some imaginative death and dismemberment sequences.  The movie is GROSS.  Often gloriously so.  But isn't this the reason we watch these films...those of us that do?  Do we watch the zombies so we can enjoy witty banter and biting social commentary?  Or do we tolerate the bad acting and clumsy dialogue so we can enjoy some good zombie gore?  I modestly suggest it is the latter.  I don't feel proud of the admission...but there IS something satisfying about those bursts of adrenalin that come from a close call with a zombie that is then dispatched in the squishiest possible way.Just to give you an idea of the newest gross-outs:  (by the way, if you aren't interested in gory details, please don't read this paragraph).  In one scene in a hospital, our heroes are out of ammo and there's still one zombie remaining.  She shambles towards our cameraman, but one of his friends grabs a defibrillator and shocks the head of the zombie.  The zombie briefly twitches and then its eyes swell and then burst in a gelatinous explosion.  It is horrifically gross, but I also had to wonder how this scene was so convincingly executed.There's one death of a zombie, involving acid, that was clearly done with CGI...but for the most part, this is old school makeup and low-tech special effects.So overall, I recommend the movie...just barely...but really only to fans of the genre (or niche, really).  The film is full of flaws...but nonetheless will appease those who hunger for some more flesh-eating zombie action.",3,Fans of Romero will welcome the gore...but not the clumsy social

1140916,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0013D8LA4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[2, 3]","Diary of the Dead (George Romero, 2007)I had thought, after George Romero gave us a twenty-year wait for the fourth Dead film, that Land of the Dead would be the final entry in the series. And given the quality of Land of the Dead, I didn't figure that as a bad thing. But here we are a couple of years later, and Romero has ditched major-studio funding and massive shooting schedules, and we have the fifth Dead film, Diary of the Dead. In every way possible, this is a back-to-the-roots effort for Romero; it's derivative, it has no budget whatsoever, it features a cast of unknowns, it's short and to the point, and it's the most fun I've had watching a George Romero joint since Monkey Shines.Diary of the Dead dispenses with the idea that this is going to be original early on, heading straight into the territory of Cloverfield and [REC], giving us a movie shot from the perspective of a handheld videocamera. Old news, right? Well, yeah, but the reason it's become such a popular conceit in the past thirteen years or so is because it's a very effective way of limiting what the viewer can possibly know about what's going on, and letting the viewer know that's what's happening. It also lends a sense of immediacy to the proceedings that is just as effective (and fun) here as it was in either Cloverfield or [REC]. This is an alternate universe for Romero's Dead films, for obviously videocameras didn't exist back in the day, but the dead are rising for the first time (or these are the dumbest characters you've ever seen in a movie). So we get a bunch of folks running around trying to avoid zombies who want to eat them (or, another well-used but still effective zombie-movie conceit, refusing to believe that loved ones are dead, because after all, they're walking around again; one of the most memorable scenes from Romero's own Dawn of the Dead plays on this). And sometimes failing. And running into other survivors who are more interested in stealing what you have than helping a brother out. That sort of thing. It's nothing new, plotwise, but it's blissfully obvious that Romero had a great deal of fun with this. And sometimes that's what makes the difference between a turgid piece of nonsense like Land of the Dead and a witty, urbane success like Diary of the Dead. ***",3,There is life after Land of the Dead!,1212105600,"05 30, 2008",2008,2293,"['Diary', 'Dead', 'George', 'Romero', '2007', 'had', 'thought', 'George', 'Romero', 'gave', 'twenty-year', 'wait', 'fourth', 'Dead', 'film', 'Land', 'Dead', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'entry', 'series', 'given', 'quality', 'Land', 'Dead', 'did', ""n't"", 'figure', 'bad', 'thing', 'here', 'are', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'Romero', 'ditched', 'major-studio', 'funding', 'massive', 'shooting', 'schedules', 'have', 'fifth', 'Dead', 'film', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'way', 'possible', 'back-to-the-roots', 'effort', 'Romero', 'derivative', 'budget', 'whatsoever', 'cast', 'unknowns', 'short', 'point', 'most', 'fun', ""'ve"", 'had', 'watching', 'George', 'Romero', 'joint', 'Monkey', 'Shines.Diary', 'Dead', 'dispenses', 'idea', 'going', 'be', 'original', 'early', 'heading', 'straight', 'territory', 'Cloverfield', '[', 'REC', ']', 'giving', 'movie', 'shot', 'perspective', 'handheld', 'videocamera', 'Old', 'news', 'right', 'Well', 'yeah', 'reason', 'become', 'such', 'popular', 'conceit', 'past', 'thirteen', 'years', 'so', 'very', 'effective', 'way', 'limiting', 'what', 'viewer', 'can', 'possibly', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'letting', 'viewer', 'know', 'what', 'happening', 'also', 'sense', 'immediacy', 'proceedings', 'just', 'effective', 'fun', 'here', 'was', 'Cloverfield', '[', 'REC', ']', 'alternate', 'universe', 'Romero', 'Dead', 'films', 'obviously', 'videocameras', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'back', 'day', 'dead', 'are', 'rising', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'dumbest', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'get', 'bunch', 'folks', 'running', 'around', 'trying', 'avoid', 'zombies', 'who', 'want', 'eat', 'well-used', 'still', 'effective', 'zombie-movie', 'conceit', 'refusing', 'believe', 'loved', 'ones', 'are', 'dead', ""'re"", 'walking', 'around', 'again', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'Romero', 'own', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'sometimes', 'failing', 'running', 'other', 'survivors', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'interested', 'stealing', 'what', 'have', 'helping', 'brother', 'out', 'sort', 'thing', 'nothing', 'new', 'plotwise', 'blissfully', 'obvious', 'Romero', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'what', 'difference', 'turgid', 'piece', 'nonsense', 'Land', 'Dead', 'witty', 'urbane', 'success', 'Diary', 'Dead', '***']",N/A

""Day of the Dead"" and ""Land of the Dead"" followed but were not as good as the first two-but still contained the Romero gore.Now comes ""Diary of the Dead"" and like some horror movies of late the story is told using a hand-held camera but Mr Romero thankfully has a steadier hand using this technique.  In fact he uses almost every camera device possible including a shoulder-held camera, a camera phone, internet blogs, news broadcasts and security cameras. He cleverly uses a few camera glitches from time to time but for the most part you can watch the movie without needing dramamine.The movies start-off point is a group of students and their professor making a horror movie in the woods for extra credit. Once they realize something is wrong the rest of the movie is the usual fight for their lives from the ever increasing legion of zombies.

Land of the Dead actually had many things that Diary is lacking, such as:* An adequate budget. Diary looks cheap and uses a lot of unconvincing CGI gore effects. The plot is designed to accommodate a scanty budget and so Diary lacks the panoramic epic feel that Land (and Dawn) had. The lack of money perhaps is linked to another deficiency of Diary vis a vis Land, mainly:* Decent acting: the professional cast of Land added a lot to the movie's feel and narrative. The community theater rejects in Diary are both way too old for their parts and also incapable of portraying their characters convincingly. Particular scorn must be reserved for the Roy Scheider impersonator who plays the alcoholic film professor who tags along for the ride. He takes a bad part and makes things worse by his wooden delivery of his lines and general smirkiness. His sudden epiphany as bow-wielding hero and Yoda-esque wise man is more than a bit too much to accept.Our lead ""hero"" Jason is such a wimpy passive voyeuristic jerk that one soon begins to root for his demise, and the idea of he and his movie girlfriend making a couple before the action in the movie is especially unconvincing.* A coherent plot: the script of Land, though hardly Citizen Kane, at least had elements of narrative development and resolution of issues. Diary in comparison is a series of episodic vignettes, featuring encounters that are not especially interesting. A number of dull characters and scenarios are introduced for seemingly no logical reason, and the ending is both predictable and unsatisfying.* More subtle political / social message: yes, believe it or not, even the ham-fisted community college adjunct professor Marxist polemic style of Land was more cleverly and elegantly done that Diary. Although the cartoonish human society shown in Land was both silly and blatantly hortatory, at least there weren't tedious talking head debates about the role of media in society and voice-over monologues about the narcissism of our decadent age, blah, blah, blah as happens repeatedly in Diary. Diary resembles a Critical Media Studies seminar with a few zombies thrown in, while Land was a zombie flick with some Marxist sentiment subtext.* Action! Though Land was criticized by some as having too much action in it, the dull drab Diary in comparison is like watching paint dry. Combined with the skimpy budget, watered down gore, and episodic feel, Diary is unlikely to excite viewers expecting something along the lines of Night, Dawn, Land, or even Day. When Day of the Dead trumps your film in terms of action and suspense, you know you have trouble...Sad to say, the themes that so fascinated Romero that he had to start the Dead series over are not especially compelling ones. Yes, we are all a society of passive voyeurs, manipulated by the media, prone to self-indulgent navel gazing even in the midst of apocalypse. The validity and narrative utility of these sentiments are open to debate, but the most damning criticism of Diary is that the Snyder Dawn remake addressed these same themes both more effectively and with greater efficiency. Snyder didn't need to spend the whole movie on this limited scope theme, taking just a few minutes of video cam footage to develop the exact same theme, and then besides addressing that concept, he also gave us a polished high production value looking film featuring a strong plot, mostly strong acting, other themes of interest, and lots of excitement and suspense. In comparison, Romero's re-imagining of his own universe seems bland, cheap, preachy, and uninteresting.Like the mall zombies from Romero's original Dawn, Romero's new zombie film is a pale corpse of its former self, returning to its familiar haunts, but in a lethargic, lifeless, and empty manner. We can see glimpses of Romero's talents here as he is still a technically competent filmmaker, in terms of shot composition and cinematography. There are some interesting scenarios and supporting characters here (especially the deaf Amish farmer, who shows up all too briefly) but too many elements that are either retreads (usually inferior quality ones) of earlier Romero concepts seen in his other zombie films, or that are examples of frustrated Communications Theory Professor Romero channeling McLuhan, Postman, and Chomsky in ways that bore the hell out of the viewer. Romero fans will be disappointed, new zombie movie fans will wander what all the fuss over this guy was about, and non-horror movie fans will feel like they are watching a Sci Fi Channel original, only one that is less entertaining than usual.Essentially Romero called for a do-over and then fumbled the ball... The game may be over for him, but let's wait and see.",2,Made me appreciate Land of the Dead more...,1211846400,"05 27, 2008",2008,5139,"['restart', 'Dead', 'film', 'series', 'necessitated',

This is the first of the series that I've watched all the way through, and I was pleasantly surprised. The film within a film approach is more effective, and less annoying, here than in some other examples as Romero doesn't allow the camerawork to become too shaky, disjointed, and ultimately irritating. However, the voiceover jars in places and I think more use of captions would have been a better option. The dialogue is also very ripe at times. But there are some nice ironic touches and some very funny moments. Romero's attitude towards the media and the blogosphere is suitably ambivalent although the moralising is occasionally heavy-handed. And I mustn't forget the gore, which is both well produced and marvellously over the top in places.

1140923,A1HTO5COXAY1NQ,B0013D8LA4,Skippy the Skeptic,"[4, 5]","George A. Romero's legacy as a master horror filmmaker is secure, that much I'll say at the beginning.  With films like ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Day of the Dead"", and the first two ""Creepshow"" films under his belt, George Romero has brought a lot to the genre over the years.  Unfortunately it seems as if he's beginning to lose steam.  ""Land of the Dead"" was a mediocre payoff for an ambitious effort, but ""Diary of the Dead"" is even less impressive.Coming conspicuously hot on the heels of the hand cam style kaiju movie ""Cloverfield"", ""Diary of the Dead"" is a hand cam style zombie movie. While this is an interesting concept, the execution is so weak that the film seems little better than the recent Sci-Fi Channel Original ""Return of the Living Dead"" sequels.  For one, the film begins with a voice over by one of the characters, who states woodenly that she put this film together from video she and her friends shot during the early days of a zombie outbreak.  She then notes that she ""added music to the film to try and scare you"".  Right.  From that point on, the film follows a handful of film students who are trying to make a horror movie when the outbreak starts.  They all decide to take off in an RV and regroup, one by one, with their families.  One of them, an aspiring young director named Jason, refuses to stop filming, stating repeatedly that has to record everything so people will know the truth.The idea of media truth is the central theme of this film.  It begins by implying that all big media is so slanted as to be of absolutely no value and that perhaps user-produced media (like blogs and Youtube) is a better avenue for truth.  Midway through the film, the message shifts to something along the lines of ""the more voices there are, the more spin there is because everyone wants to tell the story their way"".  Now these issues are certainly worth discussing, but Romero has completely abandoned every last iota of subtlety in addressing them.  Once upon a time Romero's films contained social commentary that had to be read into a little to really be appreciated.  ""Land of the Dead"" was more obvious about it than the previous installments, but ""Diary of the Dead"" just beats you over the head with it as if viewers will be too stupid to get such an obvious premise.This is greatly exacerbated by the ongoing voice over, always delivered in a wooden monotone, that constantly interrupts the flow of the film and even goes so far as to blow some scares for viewer by introducing them before they happen.  What in the world was Romero thinking?  The characters are all stiff and do little to draw our sympathies, and Jason, the lead, is easily the worst among them.  It is completely unbelievable that anyone, even some sort of uber-serious documentary film student, would go so far as to, say, film a zombie attack rather than helping his own friends to fight them off or stay with his charging camera rather than help his companions look for help for a gravely injured friend.  When a zombie movie is cobbled together poorly enough that believability issues enter the viewer's mind at all it means that something is very wrong.What's even weirder is that none of the characters seem all that frightened of the fact that there's zombies around.  They all seem capable of shooting perfectly straight, making wisecracks, and efficiently wielding any weapon from defibrillator paddles to dynamite to easily dispatch their foes.  The viewer never feels any real sense of danger at all, even, bizarrely, when people are dying.  The movie barely makes an effort to build tension, and almost any time some modicum of suspense is allowed to build up it is instantly blown by an intrusive and utterly unnecessary voice over.""Diary of the Dead"" is an almost staggeringly tedious movie.  Before its release I'd waited with baited breath for this movie to come out, but in all honestly I spent the final half of the movie just waiting for it to end.  It pains me to say this about a George Romero zombie movie, but I'm not lying when I say that I haven't seen a zombie flick this hard to enjoy since the legendary French stinkerZombie Lake.",2,George Romero swings and misses...,1215216000,"07 5, 2008",2008,4183,"['George', 'A.', 'Romero', 'legacy', 'master', 'horror', 'filmmaker', 'secure', 'much', ""'ll"", 'say', 'beginning', 'films', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Day', 'Dead', 'first', 'two', 'Creepshow', 'films', 'belt', 'George', 'Romero', 'brought', 'lot', 'genre', 'years', 'Unfortunately', 'beginning', 'lose', 'steam', 'Land', 'Dead', 'was', 'mediocre', 'payoff', 'ambitious', 'effort', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'even', 'less', 'impressive.Coming', 'conspicuously', 'hot', 'heels', 'hand', 'cam', 'style', 'kaiju', 'movie', 'Cloverfield', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'hand', 'cam', 'style', 'zombie', 'movie', 'interesting', 'concept', 'execution', 'so', 'weak', 'film', 'little', 'better', 'recent', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'Original', 'Return', 'Living', 'Dead', 'sequels', 'one', 'film', 'voice', 'one', 'characters', 'who', 'woodenly', 'put', 'film', 'together', 'video', 'friends', 'shot', 'early', 'days', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'then', 'added', 'music', 'film', 'try', 'scare', 'Right', 'point', 'film', 'handful', 'film', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'horror', 'movie', 'when', 'outbreak', 'decide', 'take', 'off', 'RV', 'regroup', 'one', 'one', 'families', 'One', 'aspiring', 'young', 'director', 'named', 'Jason', 'stop', 'filming', 'stating', 'repeatedly', 'record', 'everything', 'so', 'people', 'will', 'know', 'truth.The', 'idea', 'media', 'truth', 'central', 'theme', 'film', 'implying', 'big', 'media', 'so', 'slanted', 'be', 'absolutely', 'value', 'perhaps', 'user-produced', 'media', 'blogs', 'Youtube', 'better', 'avenue', 'truth', 'Midway', 'film', 'message', 'shifts', 'something', 'lines', 'more', 'voices', 'are', 'more', 'spin', 'everyone', 'tell', 'story', 'way', 'Now', 'issues', 'are', 'certainly', 'worth', 'discussing', 'Romero', 'completely', 'abandoned', 'last', 'iota', 'subtlety', 'addressing', 'Once', 'time', 'Romero', 'films', 'contained', 'social', 'commentary', 'had', 'be', 'read', 'little', 'really', 'be', 'appreciated', 'Land', 'Dead', 'was', 'more', 'obvious', 'previous', 'installments', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'just', 'beats', 'head', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'stupid', 'get', 'such', 'obvious', 'premise.This', 'greatly', 'exacerbated', 'ongoing', 'voice', 'always', 'delivered', 'wooden', 'monotone', 'constantly', 'flow', 'film', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'blow', 'scares', 'viewer', 'introducing', 'happen', 'What', 'world', 'was', 'Romero', 'thinking', 'characters', 'are', 'stiff', 'do', 'little', 'draw', 'sympathies', 'Jason', 'lead', 'easily', 'worst', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'anyone', 'even', 'sort', 'uber-serious', 'documentary', 'film', 'student', 'would', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'film', 'zombie', 'attack', 'rather', 'helping', 'own', 'friends', 'fight', 'off', 'stay', 'charging', 'camera', 'rather', 'help', 'companions', 'look', 'help', 'gravely', 'injured', 'friend', 'When', 'zombie', 'movie', 'cobbled', 'together', 'poorly', 'enough', 'believability', 'issues', 'enter', 'viewer', 'mind', 'something', 'very', 'wrong.What', 'even', 'weirder', 'none', 'characters', 'seem', 'frightened', 'fact', 'zombies', 'seem', 'capable', 'shooting', 'perfectly', 'straight', 'making', 'wisecracks', 'efficiently', 'wielding', 'weapon', 'defibrillator', 'paddles', 'dynamite', 'easily', 'dispatch', 'foes', 'viewer', 'never', 'real', 'sense', 'danger', 'even', 'bizarrely', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'dying', 'movie', 'barely', 'effort', 'build', 'tension', 'almost', 'time', 'modicum', 'suspense', 'allowed', 'build', 'up', 'instantly', 'blown', 'intrusive', 'utterly', 'unnecessary', 'voice', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'almost', 'staggeringly', 'tedious', 'movie', 'release', ""'d"", 'waited', 'baited', 'breath', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'honestly', 'spent', 'final', 'half', 'movie', 'just', 'waiting', 'end', 'say', 'George', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'lying', 'when', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'zombie', 'flick', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'legendary', 'French', 'stinkerZombie', 'Lake']",N/A

Diary of the Dead is no zombie masterpiece, but it is much better than the abundance of criticism that it received suggests.Diary is the story of what goes down with a group of young folks at the time of the zombie outbreak. In other words, the events in Diary are supposedly concurrent with the events in the original film. Unfortunately, instead of just filming the movie, Romero built the story around the events all being captured on raw video...mainly on a portable video-cam, a laBlair Witchand more recentlyCloverfield. This really took away from what would have been a much more enjoyable viewing experience.Storywise, Diary is not nearly as good as Tom Savini's 1990 remake ofNight of the Living Dead, nor is Diary even close to Zack Snyder's 2004 remake ofDawn of the Dead. But at least Diary of the Dead is mountains above Romero's awful, 2005 integrity-killerLand of the Dead.In the remake of Dawn of the Dead the zombies went to a new level: they ran, they seemed a little smarter, and (yuck) they could give birth. Then in 2005 George himself came back with Land of the Dead, and the zombies forgot how to run but were even smarter than in the Dawn remake. In Diary we go back to when it all started and the  zombies are just slow, dumb old zombies again.I was thoroughly entertained by Diary and would not suggest anyone interested in the genre pass on it.

I see it has succeeded in disappointing many fans for the most part.  That's too bad.  But for those who thought this movie was a big letdown, I do see why you feel that way.  All around I actually did like the movie.There is one misconception about this movie I have to address.  Many folks think this film ripped off Cloverfield.  Not true.  I don't know about anyone else out there, but I remember reading about this movie a few years ago.  This film hit the market after Cloverfield, but it must have been shot right around the same time.  I do know that Romero had the idea for this one a few years ago.  SO THERE!!Romero's original Living Dead Trilogy is required viewing for any hardcore horror fan.  For most of us horror geeks, these films served as the gateway to the world of gruesome, extreme and other-side-of-the-fence types of horror movies and a lot of us have never looked back since.  They're essential movies!  They're as essential as Number of the Beast is to the Iron Maiden fan or Hannah Montana to preteen girls and pedophiles, or ""Margaritaville"" to every damn ocean cruise you go on.So many years of repeated viewings of the Trilogy(if you're like me you could do a one man Broadway performance of all three films), and the impact it's had on our movie tastes, how is Romero supposed to top that?  Or even get close to that?  Eight billion zombie films make it into the theater and video shelves every month anymore it seems.  Romero's films don't seem terribly unique anymore.  I enjoyed Land of the Dead(a lot of people seemed to), but it just didn't feel the same.  It was a good movie, but I just couldn't find myself lumping it in with the Trilogy.  Too much time has passed and too many bad changes to the film industry have occurred.I feel pretty much the same for Diary.  I like the fact that Romero went back to his low budget, independent style of film making.  Like in Land, he approaches the subject matter with a bit more intelligence than most zombie films.  After all, it is HIS genre.  Romero and John Russo more or less created the world and the rules that most zombie films play by.I didn't mind the story of Diary, nor did I mind not seeing hordes and hordes of zombies onscreen.  I actually enjoyed the ""less is more"" type of approach.  But as a personal preference, I don't like films that are presented as footage through the camera lens of an individual shooting the events.  I don't think it's a dumb idea, I unfortunately get ill when I watch it.  I always get a headache and/or nauseous feeling when watching it.  Most people don't experience this at all, and it may be piddly, but the fact is that it always does it to me, so I don't enjoy this type of format.  I am glad that I watched it however.  I probably just won't want it many times unless I take the necessary precautions beforehand.",4,Dramamine Of The Dead,1218931200,"08 17, 2008",2008,2928,"['Ah', 'hell', ""'d"", 'might', 'as', 'well', 'put', 'two', 'cents', 'new', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'film', 'see', 'succeeded', 'disappointing', 'many', 'fans', 'most', 'part', 'too', 'bad', 'who', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'big', 'letdown', 'do', 'see', 'why', 'feel', 'way', 'actually', 'did', 'movie.There', 'one', 'misconception', 'movie', 'have', 'address', 'Many', 'folks', 'think', 'film', 'ripped', 'off', 'Cloverfield', 'Not', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'else', 'there', 'remember', 'reading', 'movie', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'hit', 'market', 'Cloverfield', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'right', 'same', 'time', 'do', 'know', 'Romero', 'had', 'idea', 'one', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'THERE', 'Romero', 'original', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Trilogy', 'required', 'viewing', 'hardcore', 'horror', 'fan', 'most', 'horror', 'geeks', 'films', 'served', 'gateway', 'world', 'gruesome', 'extreme', 'other-side-of-the-fence', 'types', 'horror', 'movies', 'lot', 'have', 'never', 'looked', 'back', ""'re"", 'essential', 'movies', ""'re"", 'as', 'essential', 'Number', 'Beast', 'Iron', 'Maiden', 'fan', 'Hannah', 'Montana', 'preteen', 'girls', 'pedophiles', 'Margaritaville', 'damn', 'ocean', 'cruise', 'go', 'on.So', 'many', 'years', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'Trilogy', ""'re"", 'could', 'do', 'one', 'man', 'Broadway', 'performance', 'three', 'films', 'impact', 'had', 'movie', 'tastes', 'how', 'Romero', 'supposed', 'top', 'even', 'get', 'close', 'Eight', 'billion', 'zombie', 'films', 'make', 'theater', 'video', 'shelves', 'month', 'Romero', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'terribly', 'unique', 'anymore', 'enjoyed', 'Land', 'Dead', 'lot', 'people', 'seemed', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'same', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'lumping', 'Trilogy', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'passed', 'too', 'many', 'bad', 'changes', 'film', 'industry', 'have', 'occurred.I', 'feel', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'Diary', 'fact', 'Romero', 'went', 'back', 'low', 'budget', 'independent', 'style', 'film', 'making', 'Land', 'subject', 'matter', 'bit', 'more', 'intelligence', 'most', 'zombie', 'films', 'HIS', 'genre', 'Romero', 'John', 'Russo', 'more', 'less', 'created', 'world', 'rules', 'most', 'zombie', 'films', 'play', 'by.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'story', 'Diary', 'did', 'mind', 'not', 'seeing', 'hordes', 'hordes', 'zombies', 'onscreen', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'less', 'more', 'type', 'approach', 'personal', 'preference', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'films', 'are', 'presented', 'footage', 'camera', 'lens', 'individual', 'shooting', 'events', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'dumb', 'idea', 'unfortunately', 'get', 'ill', 'when', 'watch', 'always', 'get', 'headache', 'and/or', 'nauseous', 'feeling', 'when', 'watching', 'Most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'experience', 'may', 'be', 'piddly', 'fact', 'always', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'type', 'format', 'am', 'glad', 'watched', 'however', 'probably', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'many', 'times', 'take', 'necessary', 'precautions', 'beforehand']",N/A

1140933,A2R70Z8WQ8BZNB,B0013D8LA4,"TANTRUM!!!! ""...no longer Maria!""","[8, 12]","Thank you George A. Romero! After the last futuristic vision of the Zombie apocalypse on earth, the great action-horror packed, with incredibly creepy-atmosphere, but too zombie-concerned ""Land of the Dead"", the master finally  finished or ended his previous ""living dead"" series with extreme prejudice: Knowing that his last major production hitted rock bottom in every possible aspect one can refer to, he Re-started his beloved saga from point  zero in an original revision to his first classic masterpiece, ""Night of the Living Dead"". The only two factors in this movie that could cloud our vision about some controversial ""usual"" issues, is our pre-judgement product of having witnessed in the flesh and at the time, the continuity and evolution of this major classic series, and the obvious aproach of the film for today's standards. For newcomers, this will be fantastic. I  know, cause i felt like one: Wow, talking about some fresh air! I believed that the next Romero's movie would explain the reason why the dead walk..... Pheeww!!!!!No more sequels people, this is a pure revision of the zombie mythology in a great new concept, absolutely teenage oriented like every ""re-born"" horror saga or re-make fashion these days, of course . I didn't say original, cause after all, the filmaking style is based on other succesful but used concepts like ""the blair witch project"" or even the fresh-but-awful re-make of ""the texas chainsaw massacre"". The new horror industry still rules despite Romero's ideas, don't ever forget that, in order to forgive some anoying issues that he must be aware about too. Anyway, the story is simple, straight-forward but effective, with outstanding tale development for a horror movie, even for Romero: A student filmaker is setting out to shoot a low-budget film in the Pensylvania woods, some kind of amateur production about mummies, along with some friends in what you could describe as a funny adventure. All well, untill the media reports starts talking about dead people rising from their graves and attacking human beings. The unbelievable horror they witness unchain the devastating struggle to remain calm and sane, and then run to seek shelter without any logical explanation for the horrible nightmare unleashed before their eyes.Instead of filming a hilarious monster home-made film, our student end up capturing the breakdown of modern society under the ravaging hordes of  flesh-eating re-animated corpses. The story of  survival under such new, menacing, tense, and creepy circumstances reminded me of  the first ""Night of the living dead"", with the media reports, the panic, the claustrophobic ambient and the desperate will to overcome and survive this nightmare no matter what. It's actually easy to compenetrate with the escence of this dark and gruesome hell-on-earth story, it's even easier to feel the zombie apocalypse under our skin, better than any other previous Romero's zombie movie.Of course, the zombie imagery is awesome as usual: what can i say about every take involving those gruesome creatures devouring life itself and leaving a path of despair and destruction behind them? The usual pshycological and physical effects proper of the ""they're us"" epidemic remain intact. A perfect match for such a visceral and kinetic race out of hell that is the movie itself. The filming style may disturb our concentration a bit, but this is because we're enjoying so much!Well, two things can be happening here: Either this is the best zombie movie i've seen in years, or i'm just too glad to have Romero back in the ""right"" track! No matter what,  this is a must see for Romero's fans and for horror fans worlwide. Long life for the ""Dead""!WARNING: Too much focus on the amateurish cam style and flaws of production, as well as prejudice towards the series or Romero, may result in a painful dead followed by the awakening as a flesh-eating ghoul.

I really wish I could be writing that this is a masterpiece of zombie apocalyptic proportions.  I really wish I could say Romero is back and scary as ever, unfortunately I can't.  After forcing myself to digest the rotting piece of flesh that is ""Diary of the Dead"" all I could say about the film was, ""What a piece of crud"".  The story and script are boring, lackluster and predictable, the suspense, tension and terror was non-existent, and the only thing that was horrifying was the acting.  After creating the quintessential zombie landmark films ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" and then going on to dump out such mediocre and sub par flops like ""Land of the Dead"" and now ""Diary of the Dead"", one has to wonder if Romero was ever really the sole maestro behind his two earlier masterpieces to begin with.  In fact, with the exception of ""Martin"" and ""The Crazies"", what other Romero horror films can claim to be classics?  Perhaps it was the combined talents of the production companies involved in his earlier efforts that made those such outstanding, amazing and terrifying cinematic stand-outs.  In ""Diary of the Dead"" Romero attempts to go back to the roots of the zombie outbreak, trying to achieve a docudrama, un-staged, realistic accounting of where it all began.  Sadly, the film falls pitifully short of coming even close to the feeling of isolation, confusion and shear panic that the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" handed audiences so masterfully four decades ago.  Perhaps all the blame for the films shortcomings should not be cast on Romero alone, maybe it is just a sign of the times.  In this fast paced, MTV generation with ferocious, fast moving, olympic sprinter zombies from Zack Snyder's masterfully re-imagined 2004 ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, did the old school, shambling, slow moving zombies of the past ever really stand a chance at scaring audiences anymore?

1140937,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B0013D8LA4,Tim Janson,"[1, 3]","George Romero's four previous zombie films have all followed a natural progression.  The Zombie outbreak started in Night of the Living Dead and by the time we reached Land of the Dead the zombies had become the dominant species.  However, Romero takes the series back to its roots with Diary of the Dead in more ways than one.  Consider this a reboot or a re-take on the start of the zombie outbreak.  We are back in Pennsylvania just as the first few reports of the dead returning to life are being broadcast on local news stations.  A group of University of Pittsburgh students, working on their own horror film for a class project, pile into a motor home to try and get home.  Jason (Joshua Close), the director of their film, decides to start recording the entire event on his camera.The group has their first encounter with a zombie along the highway as a burned up state trooper tries to stop their RV.  The full realization of what is happening finally hits them as they take an injured friend to a hospital only to find it empty...except for a few undead doctors and nurses.  Even as the carnage unfolds, Jason continues to film, uploading his footage onto the Internet even as his girlfriend Debra chastises him for his insensitivity.  Immediately you're thinking Night of the Living Dead meets Cloverfield because of the handheld camera.  The camera work in Diary is certainly less jerky than in Cloverfield and much of the time you'll barely notice it.Diary is the closest zombie film yet in terms of scope to Night of the Living Dead.  It's a small cast working within the confines of a handful of sets and locations.  There are fewer zombies than in any previous Romero zombie film since ""Night"".  This is all by design.  Romero wanted to return to a smaller, independent feature.  His intent was to make the film for under a million dollars.  This was a very personal film for George, one that he could do entirely his way without having to please studio bosses.  Romero talks quite candidly about this during the making of documentary. While he certainly enjoyed working with the bigger budget he had with Land of the Dead, you get the feeling that he's more comfortable with a smaller film.The cast is largely unknown but not inexperienced.  Most of the actors have at least a couple of dozen credits in both film and TV.  No one stands out but no one hams it up either.  What the film lacks, however, is any real tension.  The difference with Diary and the rest of the series is that our survivors are mobile, and are not trapped within a farmhouse, shopping mall, underground bunker, or a walled city.  The one time they are pinned down within an old barn they are able to make a quick getaway.Diary is also less bloody than Romero's previous films, in part because of the camera work.  Since the whole thing is supposed to take place through the lens of Jason's camera, some of the zombie feeding activity must be imagined.  There are some notable special effects, such as the zombie who gets a jar of acid busted over his head and his skull slowly is dissolved down to the brain.  Still, you have to admire Romero.  He could have made another big-budget zombie film but he told the story that he wanted to tell.ExtrasPulling up the grade on the DVD is a nice set of extras.  Romero, Director of Photography Adam Swica, and Editor Michael Doherty provide a lively audio commentary.  The best extra is the feature lengths (80+ minutes) making of documentary covering the cast, crew, special effects, make-up, and more.Other extras include featurettes on the first week of filming, character confessionals, and the inspiration for the film.  Romero recruited some well-known horror personalities to do some of the voices you hear over the radio and TV in the film and these are covered in a featurette called ""Familiar Voices"".Finally there are five short zombie films, winners of a Myspace contest that are quite entertaining and well-made.",4,ROMERO GETS BACK TO BASICS,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,3959,"['George', 'Romero', 'four', 'previous', 'zombie', 'films', 'have', 'followed', 'natural', 'progression', 'Zombie', 'outbreak', 'started', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'time', 'reached', 'Land', 'Dead', 'zombies', 'had', 'become', 'dominant', 'species', 'However', 'Romero', 'series', 'back', 'roots', 'Diary', 'Dead', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Consider', 'reboot', 're-take', 'start', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'are', 'back', 'Pennsylvania', 'just', 'first', 'few', 'reports', 'dead', 'returning', 'life', 'are', 'being', 'broadcast', 'local', 'news', 'stations', 'group', 'University', 'Pittsburgh', 'students', 'working', 'own', 'horror', 'film', 'class', 'project', 'pile', 'motor', 'home', 'try', 'get', 'home', 'Jason', 'Joshua', 'Close', 'director', 'film', 'start', 'recording', 'entire', 'event', 'camera.The', 'group', 'first', 'encounter', 'zombie', 'highway', 'burned', 'up', 'state', 'tries', 'stop', 'RV', 'full', 'realization', 'what', 'happening', 'finally', 'take', 'injured', 'friend', 'hospital', 'only', 'find', 'empty', 'few', 'undead', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'Even', 'carnage', 'unfolds', 'Jason', 'film', 'uploading', 'footage', 'Internet', 'even', 'girlfriend', 'Debra', 'insensitivity', 'Immediately', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'meets', 'Cloverfield', 'handheld', 'camera', 'camera', 'work', 'Diary', 'certainly', 'less', 'jerky', 'Cloverfield', 'much', 'time', ""'ll"", 'barely', 'notice', 'it.Diary', 'closest', 'zombie', 'film', 'yet', 'terms', 'scope', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'small', 'cast', 'working', 'confines', 'handful', 'sets', 'locations', 'are', 'fewer', 'zombies', 'previous', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'film', 'Night', 'design', 'Romero', 'wanted', 'return', 'smaller', 'independent', 'feature', 'intent', 'was', 'make', 'film', 'million', 'dollars', 'was', 'very', 'personal', 'film', 'George', 'one', 'could', 'do', 'entirely', 'way', 'having', 'please', 'studio', 'bosses', 'Romero', 'quite', 'candidly', 'making', 'documentary', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'working', 'bigger', 'budget', 'had', 'Land', 'Dead', 'get', 'feeling', 'more', 'comfortable', 'smaller', 'film.The', 'cast', 'largely', 'unknown', 'not', 'inexperienced', 'Most', 'actors', 'have', 'least', 'couple', 'dozen', 'credits', 'film', 'TV', 'one', 'out', 'one', 'hams', 'up', 'either', 'What', 'film', 'lacks', 'however', 'real', 'tension', 'difference', 'Diary', 'rest', 'series', 'survivors', 'are', 'mobile', 'are', 'not', 'trapped', 'farmhouse', 'shopping', 'mall', 'underground', 'bunker', 'walled', 'city', 'one', 'time', 'are', 'pinned', 'down', 'old', 'barn', 'are', 'able', 'make', 'quick', 'getaway.Diary', 'also', 'less', 'bloody', 'Romero', 'previous', 'films', 'part', 'camera', 'work', 'whole', 'thing', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'lens', 'Jason', 'camera', 'zombie', 'feeding', 'activity', 'must', 'be', 'imagined', 'are', 'notable', 'special', 'effects', 'such', 'zombie', 'who', 'jar', 'acid', 'busted', 'head', 'skull', 'slowly', 'dissolved', 'down', 'brain', 'Still', 'have', 'admire', 'Romero', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'big-budget', 'zombie', 'film', 'told', 'story', 'wanted', 'tell.ExtrasPulling', 'up', 'grade', 'DVD', 'nice', 'set', 'extras', 'Romero', 'Director', 'Photography', 'Adam', 'Swica', 'Editor', 'Michael', 'Doherty', 'provide', 'lively', 'audio', 'commentary', 'best', 'extra', 'feature', 'lengths', '80+', 'minutes', 'making', 'documentary', 'covering', 'cast', 'crew', 'special', 'effects', 'make-up', 'more.Other', 'extras', 'include', 'featurettes', 'first', 'week', 'filming', 'character', 'confessionals', 'inspiration', 'film', 'Romero', 'recruited', 'well-known', 'horror', 'personalities', 'do', 'voices', 'hear', 'radio', 'TV', 'film', 'are', 'covered', 'featurette', 'called', 'Familiar', 'Voices', '.Finally', 'are', 'five', 'short', 'zombie', 'films', 'winners', 'Myspace', 'contest', 'are', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'well-made']",N/A
1140938,AK8LX5E8O3AT5,B0013D8LA4,Timothy Ramzyk,"[23, 32]","I took in Diary Of The Dead tonight, I liked it.  The audience of The 20-year-old boys around me didn't seem to like it, but I can see why. Truly it's not a zombie film, and I think Romero had little interest in making one this time around. It's much more a scathing critique of our cultures narcissism.In a way it's a very clever device Romero uses to satirize. The conceit is that the film is this self-important, green, and not necessarily talented college student's film. It first shows the kid trying to shoot a crappy student horror film, and then he gets wind of the zombie events unfolding and decides it's his duty to document it, as he and a small crew are already are out in the universities movie-van.  So it becomes today's generation's take on the event, in their own ""I just gotta tell someone everything that happens to me"" way (Yes, I know I doing the same by writing my review of this film).Anyone who wants just another ""Romero zombie film"" is going to be gravely disappointed, anyone who dismisses it a just a ""Blair Witch"" zombie film is missing the considerable wit and insight Romero has brought to the table.

It's problems are (unfortunately) numerous:1.  The acting for the most part is HORRIBLE.  We are talking sub-porno movie level here.  Only occasionally does a character actually act like a normal person, the rest of the time they behave like a bunch of college kids that are trying to act.2.  The character development is bad.  Character development is usually a big part of Romero's zombie flicks.  You actually care about the characters and what happens to them, and you begin to understand them on a certain level.  not in this movie.  You dont learn much about the characters and you dont care if they live or die.  Well, that's not entirely true.  Towards the end of the movie I was hoping they would all be horribly killed, but i dont think that is the effect Romero was going for.3.  No sountrack to speak of.  There are short bursts of music occasionally, but not NEARLY enough.  Most of the time it is silent and all you hear are the forced and crappy dialog from the characters.  Not good.  Also, the lack of a definable soundtrack takes away much of the impact from the zombie attacks.4.  It is too preachy.  There is an underlying moral message in the movie, which is good, but the characters pound it into your head by saying the same points over and over and over again.  There is not a trace of subtlety, which is surprising, because that has always been a Romero strong point.5.  There is no story to speak of.  Zombies attack a film crew so the film crew runs, and the story just follows them as they drive through the countryside.  That's it.  No revelations, no plot twists, nothing.  Just following these dorks around.Here are things I DID like:1.  It is Romero, which means that even if it isnt that great, it will still be better than 99% of the zombie flicks out there.2.  I am not a fan of the first-person camera style, but it is used well here, and doesn't get all shaky constantly like it is b eing held by Michael J. Fox.  The use of surveillance video and news broadcasts was a cool touch too.3.  The zombie deaths are imaginative and look good.  No one can kill a zombie like Romero.4.  Despite being shot independantly with a small budget, the film looks very good and does not have that ""cheap"" look a lot of indy films have.5.

1140940,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0013D8LA4,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","In ""Diary of the Dead"" George A Romero returns to his roots. That is what some people say, and they are right in more than one sense. Unlike his previous ""Land of the Dead"" ""Diary"" is made with a lower budget and largely unknown cast, more like an independent film. ""Diary"" also takes us back to the earlier days when the dead started walking and eating the flesh of the living. For all the merits of the film, however, I was slightly disappointed with his latest entry.The story is not bad. It is about a group of film students and one professor in Pennsylvania, witnessing the world slowly ending around them, with people turning into flesh-eating zombies. Clearly the 68-year-old veteran hasn't lost his touch. Some scenes are scary and some gory (what happens if you use an AED on a zombie?) Some scenes are really funny in a twisted way.All those events are told through the camera-eye. The film-within-film that follows the terrifying events are actually, according to the narrator, edited (using ""footage"" downloaded from the net), and sound effects are added to the final cut. In this way ""Diary"" tries to make its oft-used hand-held camera device more accessible.I don't disagree with the narrative method itself. Still what we see is essentially the same as before. People get bitten and they become undead. ""Diary of the Dead"" has great opening, and the fast-paced storytelling and Romero's skill as director keep us interested, but we know where the film is going, and it does.Perhaps the film should have been made at least seven years earlier when we were not still perfectly aware of the impact of the ""live"" images of the media, or the potential of YouTube. I agree with most of Romero's social messages, but with all respect to him his social commentaries are obvious to most of us now.George A Romero's ""Diary of the Dead"" has its moments.

The way it is filmed does not bother me like it did other people that gave it unfavorable reviews. What I like is that it starts back in the beginning. Right when the original zombie outbreak occurs.

There are a few surprises that I liked as well. I won't spoil it for you, but George has always had unique ways for the Zombies to get killed. Take the helicopter blade to the head part in ""Dawn of the Dead"" for instance. Well, let's just say that in this movie there is a scene that equals or betters that scene.

This is a plus in my eyes considering that most of the recent zombie movies seem to follow the Dawn of the Dead mold as seen in the remake and in the 28 series. If you have different taste however you'll probably be left wanting for more.The special effects where very good and work despite the fact that Romero starts goofing around in some scenes as usual. Thankfully he decided to not do something as ridiculous as the elastic zombie in Land of the Dead.The one big negative I see is that the movie looks too clean for its own good. Had this movie been made earlier with old school grainy film I could bet that it would get a cult following from people who think the original NOTLD is the best movie in the series. Unfortunately the crisp visuals can make follwing the movie distracting and some people just won't be able to relax and let themselves be entertained.,4,Worth a look,1222214400,"09 24, 2008",2008,1411,"[""'m"", 'too', 'much', 'Romero', 'zombie', 'fan', 'give', 'objective', 'review', 'so', ""'ll"", 'just', 'give', 'impressions.Despite', 'giving', '4', 'stars', 'movie', 'people', 'seem', 'love', 'hate', 'should', 'try', 'buy', 'think', 'best', 'romero', 'zombie', 'movie', 'first', 'then', 'think', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'think', 'second', 'one', 'best', 'then', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'sure.This', 'movie', 'follow', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'Day', 'Dead', 'mold', 'where', 'more', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'much', 'action', 'Dawn', 'Land', 'Dead', 'plus', 'eyes', 'considering', 'most', 'recent', 'zombie', 'movies', 'seem', 'follow', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'mold', 'seen', 'remake', '28', 'series', 'have', 'different', 'taste', 'however', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'left', 'wanting', 'more.The', 'special', 'effects', 'where', 'very', 'good', 'work', 'fact', 'Romero', 'goofing', 'around', 'scenes', 'usual', 'Thankfully', 'decided', 'not', 'do', 'something', 'as', 'ridiculous', 'elastic', 'zombie', 'Land', 'Dead.The', 'one', 'big', 'negative', 'see', 'movie', 'too', 'clean', 'own', 'good', 'Had', 'movie', 'been', 'made', 'earlier', 'old', 'school', 'grainy', 'film', 'could', 'bet', 'would', 'get', 'cult', 'following', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'original', 'NOTLD', 'best', 'movie', 'series', 'Unfortunately', 'crisp', 'visuals', 'can', 'make', 'follwing', 'movie', 'distracting', 'people', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'relax', 'let', 'be', 'entertained']",N/A

1140945,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0013D8LA4,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[7, 9]","Being a George Romero fan, of course I was very excited to see ""Diary of the Dead"". I didn't particularly care for his previous film; ""Land of the Dead""(Romero's big budget outing) but hey, even great directors have their bad moments. With a very small budget, Romero's latest film seem to have captured the documentary style ""gimmick"" that have plagued other films. I never really cared for this style, I've always thought it was a one-hit wonder with ""Blair Witch Project"". Armed with a measly budget, can an acclaimed director pull off the dead end gimmick of a first person view? It almost feels blasphemous to give a critical review to a George Romero film, but amazon friends; Dave K and M have done it, Jenny, Main Man, M.B Cole and Chris Blackshere are on the middle ground while T-man loved this film. I'll give it a go. The issues with ""Diary..."" isn't all cosmetic, it was discipline.The film is supposedly a documentary that is shot by a film student named Jason (Joshua Close) and narrated by his girlfriend Debra (Michelle Morgan). The film's main premise is that while they are in the woods with an alcoholic film professor (Scott Wentworth), the news of the dead coming back to life and feeding on the living breaks out. They pack up, gets in the RV and try to head home. In their journey, they encounter zombies, a militant group, zombies, a deaf amish, zombies, ex-national guardsmen, zombies, meet up with a friend, zombies...sounds repetitive doesn't it?As with Romero's other films, ""Diary of the Dead"" contains a social commentary. No, it is not subtle at all; this message seemed to have taken the audience by its neck and kept on shaking until we passed out from boredom. It deals with the fact that because of the internet, more folks from all walks of life are reporting on current news and events, the more videos, the more the truth gets blurry until we don't know just what the truth is anymore. As usual, Romero uses the `undead' to make such a statement and fans are undoubtedly split on its preachy tone. The drunken film professor never runs out of alcohol and never runs out of insights about the past war and the philosophical aspects of mankind's inhumane actions seem to be a little out of place when he shoots a zombie with an arrow. There are also some attempts at satire with an deaf Amish but it seemed so cheap and incongruous. The SFX sometimes looked realistic, then at times looked very fake. It wasn't consistent in its delivery of the `undead'.Romero also makes a bit of subtle coaching (he is the proclaimed zombie guru) to aspiring filmmakers when the characters discuss the workings of a horror flick; why is it women always loses their shoe, they trip over something, gets their clothes ripped to show a bit of skin? Then as a touch of irony a girl does trip, loses a shoe, gets her outfit ripped to show some breasts when she was being chased by a zombie. Romero also criticizes the more modern zombie flicks when he expresses that the `undead's' bones and joints are so brittle from decomposition that if they move fast, their `undead' bodies would break apart; therefore ""moving slowly"" or ""shambling"" is a necessity for all `undead' stars. (imagine that)The problems in ""Diary.."" is that suspense is none-existent as the DV camera gimmick kills all attempts at such. The film also suffers quite a bit from the feeling that we've all seen it before, and we've seen it done better. The film also gets repetitive and their sense of purpose doesn't really provide any sense of credibility, which is further emphasized that the characters are so wooden and one-dimensional and the acting looks like they're reading the script out of the cue card. There is also a very annoying scene where Jason just kept on shooting his camera while a colleague was being chased by a zombie that displays his obsession with the documentary itself. This feeling of annoyance gives the character a very unlikable impression, much like the characters in ""Cloverfield"". It was quite annoying and nauseating to watch someone be so insensitive and at the same time dull. Perhaps this was an attempt (another commentary) to point out the indifference of everyday folks to the plight of their fellow men. Homelessness, poverty, etc.My point to all this is while I agree that nobody mixes in social commentary with zombies as a vehicle better than George Romero; halfway through the film it was just too much and turned out so boring. This is a horror film and if and when I want to watch social preaching, I'll watch TV. The film is so darned predictable that as I expected, characters will make bad decisions, drive somewhere, they'd encounter zombies, narrowly escape, split into groups, then get trapped somehow and encounter zombies again. While I did expect the film to be full of clich&eacute;, I just wished Romero could have given it more thought in concentrating on giving thrills and chills (or even more gore) to cover it all up than stooping to a ""commentary"" about current society. Instead, the film is an overload of annoying scenes and an overkill of the same ol'stuff to cover up its very hollow execution. Body counts are aplenty but none of them were inventive, making the film very forgettable. It is not subtle at all with its message that in the end it just left a very bitter taste in my mouth. I really wanted to like this film and I doubt it will grow on me.Die-hard fans will still praise and applaud this film just because it was made by George Romero; isn't it ironic that this film comments on the truth becoming  jumbled when too many eyes are involved? Maybe it was the expectations and the hype that killed the film`s enjoyment?RENTAL  [2  Stars]",3,This was Painful; more a Social commentary than a horror flick...,1213056000,"06 10,

I felt that the relatively lesser and completely unknown actors added to the movie's realism, because I really think if there was a ""name,"" it might've distracted from the movie. All the actors were competent and comfortable in their roles, and I had no problem with any of them...well except for the Texan lady. She seemed a little forced upon viewing the movie again.2) PRODUCTION: As usual, Romero shows how much can be done with little money. While some viewers will not like the hand held camera type of filming, it does add to the tone of the movie and I think it is done well. The Blair Witch Project used similar tactics, but (in my opinion) often there were many scenes that were almost unviewable due to the rapid movement of the camera. Romero keeps the scenes well under control. Romero also has successfully combined the usual high quality film making with the social commentary and our beloved zombies (along with some great zombie kills!)3) ZOMBIES: What can I say? These are the wonderful Romero zombies that we have all grown to love.4) THE CAUSE: Let's see...what was the cause in 1968's NotLD? (you all should know this!)5) NUDITY: None.FINAL:What can I say? Many people have put Romero on a pedestal with his zombie movies. Some have said this was a sad swansong for him, others have praised him for showing he still has what it takes.
