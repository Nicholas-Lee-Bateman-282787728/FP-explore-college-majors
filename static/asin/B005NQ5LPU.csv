1496052,A31RM5QU797HPJ,B005NQ5LPU,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","This anime took me by surprise.  I will admit that it uses the same old formula seen in other anime series...especially Harem anime.  Now I happen to like some of the Harem anime.  Tenchi Muyo was one of the first anime series I watched.  But that's besides the point.  Rosario + Vampire is about a human going to an academy meant for monsters;  Monsters such as Vampires, Succubi, Witches, etc.  Humans aren't accepted in the academy and humans can't even get to the academy because of a special  barrier that surrounds it.  Of course, Tsunkune Aono--a human--ends up going to the academy and makes some friends who are all monsters and who are all girls......and of course they want to get in his pants.  None of the characters are deep.  As I continued to watch the anime, I started to like it more and more. The climax to the first season was brilliant as was the ending to the second season.  Is it perfect?  I'd say no.  But I did like it.  I didn't read the magna so I can't say which is better.",4,Review and a Vampire,1330819200,"03 4, 2012",2012,1002,"['anime', 'took', 'surprise', 'will', 'admit', 'same', 'old', 'formula', 'seen', 'other', 'anime', 'series', 'especially', 'Harem', 'anime', 'Now', 'happen', 'like', 'Harem', 'anime', 'Tenchi', 'Muyo', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'anime', 'series', 'watched', 'point', 'Rosario', '+', 'Vampire', 'human', 'going', 'academy', 'meant', 'monsters', 'Monsters', 'such', 'Vampires', 'Succubi', 'Witches', 'etc', 'Humans', 'are', ""n't"", 'accepted', 'academy', 'humans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'academy', 'special', 'barrier', 'course', 'Tsunkune', 'Aono', 'human', 'up', 'going', 'academy', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'monsters', 'who', 'are', 'girls', 'course', 'want', 'get', 'pants', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'deep', 'continued', 'watch', 'anime', 'started', 'like', 'more', 'more', 'climax', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'brilliant', 'was', 'ending', 'second', 'season', 'perfect', ""'d"", 'say', 'no', 'did', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'magna', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'better']",N/A
1496053,AOB5695UUUJ0,B005NQ5LPU,"Anime Lover ""D""","[1, 1]","looking at past reviewers - i would have to agree with many of their opinions.  I preordered this and season two at the same time (though why did they release at the same time is a mystery to me) and was happy when I got it.  No damage and season two fits right into the box keeping them together.  but now to the reviewTskune is your average middle row joe.  but when the only school that would accept him is Yokai academy (which his father found an application on the street) is a dream come true.  But when it is discovered he is the only human in a school full of monsters, we really has  to watch his back.  But the good part he has some good friends to help him out, a vampire, a succubus, a snow fairy, and a under age witchling with a dream of a threesome.  The bad part is that all the other guys are jeaolus of him and girls fight over him, and Moka the vampire just seems to not resist sucking him dry.  Add that Mokas other side is a complete opposite of her and the teachers are all scary leads to a lot of misadventures.The anime is more moe driven than the manga, with panty shots and near nudity but most of the key elements are there, Kurumu keeps smothering the hero with her large bosom, Mizore is the silent stalker, and Yuki keeps trying to get in the middle.  Some things they should not have used is using the chibi bat to give the fight times and also cutting certain things out, or postponing them until later (in the manga moka started giving Tskune blood during the Mizore episode with the gym teacher), someone siad the fights were one sided, but given that vampires are near the top of the power charts it is only expected, and also moka does not start running into trouble until later in the mangas anyway when the fights get more serious (the disciple squad leader for one and Ruby's mentor).  But using the bat as the monster id'er was good (better than a chart explaining what they are).  Overall the series was good, and i am getting into season two so I will see how they changed this one.",4,good - but manga better,1327017600,"01 20, 2012",2012,2024,"['looking', 'past', 'reviewers', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'agree', 'many', 'opinions', 'preordered', 'season', 'two', 'same', 'time', 'why', 'did', 'release', 'same', 'time', 'mystery', 'was', 'happy', 'when', 'got', 'damage', 'season', 'two', 'fits', 'right', 'box', 'keeping', 'together', 'now', 'reviewTskune', 'average', 'middle', 'row', 'joe', 'when', 'only', 'school', 'would', 'accept', 'Yokai', 'academy', 'father', 'found', 'application', 'street', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'when', 'discovered', 'only', 'human', 'school', 'full', 'monsters', 'really', 'watch', 'back', 'good', 'part', 'good', 'friends', 'help', 'out', 'vampire', 'succubus', 'snow', 'fairy', 'age', 'witchling', 'dream', 'threesome', 'bad', 'part', 'other', 'guys', 'are', 'jeaolus', 'girls', 'fight', 'Moka', 'vampire', 'just', 'not', 'resist', 'sucking', 'dry', 'Add', 'Mokas', 'other', 'side', 'complete', 'opposite', 'teachers', 'are', 'scary', 'leads', 'lot', 'misadventures.The', 'anime', 'more', 'moe', 'driven', 'manga', 'panty', 'shots', 'near', 'nudity', 'most', 'key', 'elements', 'are', 'there', 'Kurumu', 'smothering', 'hero', 'large', 'bosom', 'Mizore', 'silent', 'stalker', 'Yuki', 'trying', 'get', 'middle', 'things', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'used', 'using', 'chibi', 'bat', 'give', 'fight', 'times', 'also', 'cutting', 'certain', 'things', 'out', 'postponing', 'later', 'manga', 'moka', 'started', 'giving', 'Tskune', 'blood', 'Mizore', 'episode', 'gym', 'teacher', 'someone', 'siad', 'fights', 'were', 'one', 'sided', 'given', 'vampires', 'are', 'top', 'power', 'charts', 'only', 'expected', 'also', 'moka', 'not', 'start', 'running', 'trouble', 'later', 'mangas', 'anyway', 'when', 'fights', 'get', 'more', 'serious', 'disciple', 'squad', 'leader', 'one', 'Ruby', 'mentor', 'using', 'bat', 'monster', ""id'er"", 'was', 'good', 'better', 'chart', 'explaining', 'what', 'are', 'series', 'was', 'good', 'i', 'am', 'getting', 'season', 'two', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'changed', 'one']",N/A

(If i were to name all of the shameless rip offs from Sekirei, you would be here all day reading this) So the kid goes, he's warned about the school, and he runs into musubi, i mean moka(same voice actress) and she happens to be a vampire, WHO HAPPENS TO BE OUT THE FREAKING SUNLIGHT!!!?? But the two become acquainted and after that it's just a HUGE plethora of boob jokes, annoying characters, AND THE BIGGEST AMOUNT OF PLOT HOLES THEN YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE, The voice casting is nice and all, and the animation is really good as well as the music, but this anime proves to me, that all that doesn't matter if the whole show and story is complete BULL-S***!!!! The second season is even worse, do not waste over 70 dollars on both seasons, spend that money on something where that money can be more worth while, see it on netflix if you are so curious, about it, just be warned, it's a F***ING NIGHTMARE LIKE GIRLS BRAVO, watch sekirei instead, it's cheaper, and it is spectacular, but avoid this anime at all times, be sure to check out my youtube channel, CinemasLot.",1,"Sekirei actor reunion party, or is it a lame excuse to make girls bravo good?",1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1410,"['anime', 'really', 'not', 'time', 'little', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'even', 'worse', 'second', 'season', 'worth', 'watching', 'one', 'thing', 'plot', 'thin', 'ridiculous', 'teen', 'father', 'drunk', 'one', 'day', 'paper', 'kid', 'high', 'school', 'reason', 'son', 'failed', 'twice', 'i', 'were', 'name', 'shameless', 'rip', 'offs', 'Sekirei', 'would', 'be', 'here', 'day', 'reading', 'kid', 'warned', 'school', 'musubi', 'i', 'mean', 'moka', 'same', 'voice', 'actress', 'be', 'vampire', 'WHO', 'TO', 'BE', 'OUT', 'THE', 'FREAKING', 'SUNLIGHT', 'two', 'become', 'acquainted', 'just', 'HUGE', 'plethora', 'boob', 'jokes', 'annoying', 'characters', 'THE', 'BIGGEST', 'AMOUNT', 'OF', 'PLOT', 'HOLES', 'THEN', 'YOU', 'COULD', 'EVER', 'IMAGINE', 'voice', 'casting', 'nice', 'animation', 'really', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'anime', ""n't"", 'matter', 'whole', 'show', 'story', 'complete', 'BULL-S***', 'second', 'season', 'even', 'worse', 'do', 'not', 'waste', '70', 'dollars', 'seasons', 'spend', 'money', 'something', 'where', 'money', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'worth', 'while', 'see', 'netflix', 'are', 'so', 'curious', 'just', 'be', 'warned', 'F***ING', 'NIGHTMARE', 'LIKE', 'GIRLS', 'BRAVO', 'watch', 'sekirei', 'instead', 'cheaper', 'spectacular', 'avoid', 'anime', 'times', 'be', 'sure', 'check', 'out', 'youtube', 'channel', 'CinemasLot']",N/A

He finds out that it is a school for youkai (monsters). On the way to his new school he meets a vampire girl named Moka. She's very self conscious from living in the human world through middle school. She quickly begins to cling to Tsukune. He also manages to attract a succubus named Kurumu, a snow woman named Mizore, and a little witch named Yukari. All 3 of these cute girls are all about him and fight like crazy people to win his affection. The problem he faces is his humanity. If he is discovered to be human he will be killed. The only other person that knows is Moka, but Moka is loving and loyal enough to keep his secret.I almost want to call this a typical harem anime, but I don't see it that way. It's better. Even though it is in the harem genre it is better than almost all of the other harem style shows I've seen. It's definitely very enjoyable. It's probably a PG-13 show. Although the nudity is minimal, unlike the 2nd season, you can't go 10 seconds in this anime w/o getting a panty shot. There's nothing wrong with that though. There are a lot of great characters; it is also animated very well. This series is filled with lot's of laughs. It's lighthearted and fun. It is a good buy for most anime fans that don't mind a little bit of risque action.",5,Way too much fun.

1496060,A3LH0LIL5BQNJW,B005NQ5LPU,Niels Bohr,"[5, 17]","This is going to be a biased review but I feel that it needs to be posted. If you have read the manga, do not buy this! See it any other way if you want but don't waste your money. They took a decent story with good characters who had some depth and then watered it down to pure stupidity and tons of panty shots. Don't get me wrong, fan service is ok with me. Like I said the characters have lost their depth, the story does nothing to express the development of them and their feelings and it completely ignores some very important scenes/interactions that advance the lead. Reading the manga got me really looking forward to this because I thought potential was there. What a let down. Like I said, this is really a warning for those who have read the manga. I wish I would have noticed the one other review with one star by another person stating the same. But I missed it so now I am adding another one star review to hopefully help someone else from wasting their money. Now, if I try to think about this as a person who had not read the manga.... I still kinda think that it's meh probably three stars at best. There are better ecchi harem comedies out there in my opinion. The voicing for the characters felt off to me, the animation was good but sometimes I felt the background was weak. Music was decent. Like I said 3 stars at best.
