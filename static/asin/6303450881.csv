The way members of the community are afraid of Nelson yet admire him even more is interestingly developed. The rapport between the two bandits as Nelson becomes Busey's mentor, even father-figure, is also nicely handled - full of warm camaraderie and gentle humor.

375097,A8YSA65M8ILK2,6303450881,"cobaltspectre ""Water Rabbit""","[24, 25]","First, I LOVED ""Barbarosa.""  I was one of the underwhelming few who tracked it down when it was in its original theatrical release, and greedily recorded it on VHS from a widescreen cable broadcast. Alas, that recording is gone, along with a heartbreakingly large quantity of other presently unobtainable material.The fatal flaw with this product is that it is presented ONLY in what they ironically call ""full-screen"" format; chop off nearly half of what you saw on the theater screen, and you get ""full-screen.""  This film has been tragically butchered.The logic of producing this product in this manner utterly eludes me.  Those of us who appreciate and value good films enough to lay out our money for an individual title on DVD want to experience the vision of the director who made it, and/or re-experience, as nearly as possible, what we first saw in the theater; not the ""vision"" of some nameless technician artlessly cropping two noses to fit into the same frame.This is not a widely known film.  Who is more likely to seek out and buy this title?  Someone who appreciated it in its original form, and now wants to see it again, or watch it with others he believes could share in his appreciation of it?  Or, someone who just needs something the right size and shape to fill the blank picture tube of his standard format television?  I posit that ANY piece of junk will fill that empty space, and such a person is far more likely to fill it with free broadcast content than to pay to fill it with this film which they probably never heard of in the first place!  I believe that anyone who is looking for this movie will be disappointed or angry that it was hacked apart; it reminds me of knocking the arms and head off from a statue to get it into a packing crate.  This was a good-- I'd say great-- movie.  No one had to do a thing except transfer it to digital and ship it out the door, and I'd have bought it, and loved it.  The director had one vision; whose vision is THIS?  Instead of ""the director's cut,"" we're presented with ""the vandal's cut.""This is an awful shame, because, as I said in the beginning, I love this movie in its true form.  I believe the story is memorably good, the photography was beautiful, the actors were well-chosen.  If you can get past the fact that this film was vandalized, there is still much to like.  I'm going to wait and hope for an undefiled version to be released, or record it on my computer the next time I see it shown in widescreen on cable.  But, if you're too impatient for that, or seeing the original version did not spoil this version for you, then I can recommend this.  ""Barbarosa"" is one of my favorite movies... but, sadly, I do not recognize this version as that movie.",2,The Vandal's Cut,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,2736,"['First', 'LOVED', 'Barbarosa', 'was', 'one', 'underwhelming', 'few', 'who', 'tracked', 'down', 'when', 'was', 'original', 'theatrical', 'release', 'greedily', 'recorded', 'VHS', 'widescreen', 'cable', 'broadcast', 'Alas', 'recording', 'gone', 'heartbreakingly', 'large', 'quantity', 'other', 'presently', 'unobtainable', 'material.The', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'product', 'presented', 'ONLY', 'what', 'ironically', 'call', 'full-screen', 'format', 'chop', 'off', 'nearly', 'half', 'what', 'saw', 'theater', 'screen', 'get', 'full-screen', 'film', 'been', 'tragically', 'butchered.The', 'logic', 'producing', 'product', 'manner', 'utterly', 'who', 'appreciate', 'value', 'good', 'films', 'enough', 'lay', 'out', 'money', 'individual', 'title', 'DVD', 'want', 'experience', 'vision', 'director', 'who', 'made', 're-experience', 'as', 'nearly', 'possible', 'what', 'first', 'saw', 'theater', 'not', 'vision', 'nameless', 'technician', 'artlessly', 'cropping', 'two', 'noses', 'fit', 'same', 'frame.This', 'not', 'widely', 'known', 'film', 'Who', 'more', 'likely', 'seek', 'out', 'buy', 'title', 'Someone', 'who', 'appreciated', 'original', 'form', 'now', 'see', 'again', 'watch', 'others', 'could', 'share', 'appreciation', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'something', 'right', 'size', 'shape', 'fill', 'blank', 'picture', 'tube', 'standard', 'format', 'television', 'posit', 'ANY', 'piece', 'junk', 'will', 'fill', 'empty', 'space', 'person', 'far', 'more', 'likely', 'fill', 'free', 'broadcast', 'content', 'pay', 'fill', 'film', 'probably', 'never', 'heard', 'first', 'place', 'believe', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'angry', 'was', 'hacked', 'apart', 'knocking', 'arms', 'head', 'statue', 'get', 'packing', 'crate', 'was', 'good', ""'d"", 'say', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'had', 'do', 'thing', 'transfer', 'digital', 'ship', 'out', 'door', ""'d"", 'have', 'bought', 'loved', 'director', 'had', 'one', 'vision', 'vision', 'THIS', 'Instead', 'director', 'cut', ""'re"", 'presented', 'vandal', 'cut', 'awful', 'shame', 'because', 'said', 'beginning', 'love', 'movie', 'true', 'form', 'believe', 'story', 'memorably', 'good', 'photography', 'was', 'beautiful', 'actors', 'were', 'well-chosen', 'can', 'get', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'vandalized', 'still', 'much', ""'m"", 'going', 'wait', 'hope', 'undefiled', 'version', 'be', 'released', 'record', 'computer', 'next', 'time', 'see', 'shown', 'widescreen', 'cable', ""'re"", 'too', 'impatient', 'seeing', 'original', 'version', 'did', 'not', 'spoil', 'version', 'then', 'can', 'recommend', 'Barbarosa', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', 'sadly', 'do', 'not', 'recognize', 'version', 'movie']",Barbarosa VHS

375099,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6303450881,Dr. James Gardner,"[0, 0]","Barbarosa is a 1982 western starring Willie Nelson and Gary Busey with a supporting cast that includes Gilbert Roland and Isela Vega.Willie Nelson (1933) is known as a singer/song writer, but in fact he appeared in more than 30 films, most of them westerns and most of them forgettable. His earlier films like ""The Electric Horseman"" (1979) and ""Honeysuckle Rose"" (1980) were among his best works, and this film is certainly his best job as an actor. Nelson plays the outlaw Barbarbosa (""red beard""), a former Texas ranger.Gary Busey (1944) made more than 100 films and was Oscar nominated for ""The Buddy Holly Story"" (1979), for which he won a BAFTA as ""most promising newcomer"". Among his memorable films are ""Point Break"" (1991), ""Lethal Weapon"" (1987), and ""Under Siege"" (1992). Busey plays a young kid who joins up with Nelson. Personally I think this is his best performance ever.Gilbert Roland (1905-94) was twice nominated for a Golden Globe (""The Bad and the Beautiful"", ""Cheyenne Autumn"") in a career that spanned nearly 60 years and 100+ films. He's probably best known for his six ""The Cisco Kid"" films (1946-7). This was his last film and his excellent acting provides a good role to exit with.  He plays the patron of a large estate and the father of a woman who loves Barbarosa.Isela Vega (1939) plays Roland's daughter. Vega made her U.S. debut in ""The Deadly Trackers"" (1973) but is best known for her role in Peckinpah's ""Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"" (1974). She's fine, but doesn't have much screen time.Gary Busey's son, Jake, has a small role as a cook.Australia born Fred Schepisi (1939) directs. He was nominated for 3 AFI awards and won twice (""The Devil's Playground"", ""A Cry in the Dark""). He made more than a dozen films including ""Six Degrees of Separation"" (1993), ""The Russia House"" (1990), and ""Mr. Baseball"" (1992). This was his first U.S. film.Schepisi brought along his cinematographer (Ian Baker) and his composer (Bruce Smeaton). Both perform admirably.The story concerns an outlaw (Nelson) who is hounded by a never ending group of assassins dispatched by the father (Roland) of his beloved wife (Vega) with whom he has a teenage girl. Along the way he befriends a young man (Busey) who himself is hunted  by his former brothers-in-law for accidentally killing their brother. Wilson takes Busey under his wing and tries to toughen him up to the realities of their joint predicaments. This results in many funny as well as tragic episodes as each group of hunters pursue their respective prey and slowly close in.The film did poorly at the box office, partly as a result of the bankruptcy of the distributor. 1982 wasn't the best year for westerns anyway. ""Barbarosa"" was the only notable oat eater. The top grossing films were ""E.T"", ""Tootsie"", ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", ""First Blood"", and ""Rocky 3"". Oscar winners were ""Ghandi"" (Picture, Actor, Director) , ""Sophie's Choice"" (Actress), ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" (Supporting Actor), and ""Tootsie"" (Supporting Actress). Other notable releases were ""My Favorite Year"", ""Personal Best"", ""Fast Times at Ridgmont High"", ""Victor/Victoria"", and ""The Verdict"".The acting is terrific on the part of all the principals, the photography is beautiful, and the story is simultaneously entertaining, funny, and tragic. The tone has the feel of a revisionist western, and seems to portray the West as it really was, rather than as we imagine it to have been.  It has the gift of being truly unique rather than being a collection of clich&eacute;s patched together in a new quilt. The last 20 minutes of the film are particularly inspiring, and the last 5 minutes are truly mythic.The LA Reader said - ""Easily the finest western to come out of Hollywood since The Wild Bunch"" and the NY Times said ""the best western in a long while"".Why Barbarosa doesn't make everyone's list of the top 25 best westerns, I can't tell you. It makes mine.

375104,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,6303450881,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[20, 22]","One of the best unknown Westerns of the last 20 years or so, Barbarosa stars Willie Nelson and Gary Busey in a story of revenge and honor.  Nelson plays a ex-Texas Ranger, Barbarosa, who's now a lone bandit, preying on rich Mexicans. During a disagreement, he formerly crippled his father-in-law to be, a Mexican landowner and still deeply loves the landowner's daughter with whom he has had a daughter.Busey is a Texas farmhand who accidentally killed his brother-in-law--his sister's husband--and is now out on his own, pursued by his brother-in-law's two brothers for revenge.  Similarly, Barbarosa is being pursued by the landowner's top gun, a fiery Mexican who vows Barbarosa's death.The two, Nelson and Busey, meet by accident and join up for a time.  During that time we get to see the West as it very likely really looked about 100 years ago (more specifically, the Southwest--i.e., southern Texas); the cinematography is magnificent.  One of the critical ingredients in any great Western is great cinematography and that is very much in display here.  As well, the score by Bruce Smeaton is excellent.Nelson and Busey do a great job--their accents certainly don't hurt (both men are originally from that part of the U.S.), and so does the supporting cast.  Fred Schepisi, the director, has a perfect sense of pacing and momentum that pulls the viewer along with very little tugging indeed.  Armadillos figure in the mix, as do old men with guns and younger men buried up to their necks.  There's a hacienda, a cantina, and an outdoor festival. The film drips with Western atmosphere, no question.Highly recommended for fans of the genre.",4,Superior Western,1059436800,"07 29, 2003",2003,1647,"['One', 'best', 'unknown', 'Westerns', 'last', '20', 'years', 'so', 'Barbarosa', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'story', 'revenge', 'honor', 'Nelson', 'ex-Texas', 'Ranger', 'Barbarosa', 'who', 'now', 'lone', 'bandit', 'preying', 'rich', 'Mexicans', 'disagreement', 'formerly', 'crippled', 'father-in-law', 'be', 'Mexican', 'landowner', 'still', 'deeply', 'landowner', 'daughter', 'whom', 'had', 'daughter.Busey', 'Texas', 'farmhand', 'who', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'brother-in-law', 'sister', 'husband', 'now', 'out', 'own', 'pursued', 'brother-in-law', 'two', 'brothers', 'revenge', 'Similarly', 'Barbarosa', 'being', 'pursued', 'landowner', 'top', 'gun', 'fiery', 'Mexican', 'who', 'Barbarosa', 'death.The', 'two', 'Nelson', 'Busey', 'meet', 'accident', 'join', 'up', 'time', 'time', 'get', 'see', 'West', 'very', 'likely', 'really', 'looked', '100', 'years', 'ago', 'more', 'specifically', 'Southwest', 'i.e.', 'southern', 'Texas', 'cinematography', 'magnificent', 'One', 'critical', 'ingredients', 'great', 'Western', 'great', 'cinematography', 'very', 'much', 'display', 'here', 'As', 'well', 'score', 'Bruce', 'Smeaton', 'excellent.Nelson', 'Busey', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'accents', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'men', 'are', 'originally', 'part', 'U.S.', 'so', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Fred', 'Schepisi', 'director', 'perfect', 'sense', 'pacing', 'momentum', 'viewer', 'very', 'little', 'tugging', 'indeed', 'Armadillos', 'figure', 'mix', 'do', 'old', 'men', 'guns', 'younger', 'men', 'buried', 'up', 'necks', 'hacienda', 'cantina', 'outdoor', 'festival', 'film', 'Western', 'atmosphere', 'question.Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'genre']",Barbarosa VHS

His father-in-law also happens to be the pueblo's chieftain.  His hatred for Nelson is so intense that he holds a bounty over his head to which all the young men of the pueblo respond. Nelson is therefore left to be a desperado who can neither be too far or too close from his wife's village.  Nelson soon encounters Busey roaming in the desert as an outcast from his own family feud. They join together as desperadoes roaming the Sonoran desert while evading men of the pueblo who seek to carry out their jefe's vendetta.The acting is excellent and all of the characters are given depth. A very touching story.

375110,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6303450881,Trevor Willsmer,"[11, 11]","Some movies are eternal victims. Case in point: Barbarosa, which had the best script and the worst luck of any of the late-70s-early-80s Westerns. Barely released to theatres after production company ITC went bust, little seen on TV and almost impossible to find on video, it turns up on DVD cropped from the impressive original 2.35:1 widescreen to a very cramped fullscreen 1.33:1, begging the question why bother to release a film in the wrong ratio this day and age?Even awkwardly cropped it still holds up, managing to straddle the middle ground between the revisionist and the mythical, taking place in a landscape at once all-too real (parched Texas wilderness, ramshackle farmsteads) and stylised (the almost cave-like room where Gilbert Roland's bitter paterfamilias endlessly retells the legend of Barbarosa to each new generation who will grow up to hunt him down and die in the attempt). As the two unlikely partners caught up in pointless blood feuds with their in-laws, Willie Nelson isn't always as good as he should be and it takes a reel or two to get used to his style and Gary Busey is nobody's idea of a Western hero, but their very unlikeliness as movie icons helps sell them as closer to the reality of the old West. And the film is also blessed with one of the best endings of the 80s, as a supposed fiesta becomes almost funereal, the dead faces of the film's `victors' sapped of all purpose until... well, see it for yourself, it's worth it.

Willie Nelson's Barbarosa & Gary Busey's Karl make a perfect pair, mentor & student, father figure & son, as they live out the myth created by Don Braulio (a superbly intense, embittered Gilbert Roland).What makes this especially interesting is Barbarosa's knowledge that he's living out a story, participating in its ongoing creation, even commenting on it at times: the legendary outlaw who is both the foe & driving force of an equally legendary family. Don Braulio's myth-making has raised his people out of poverty & given them pride & strength. He knows it, he knows how much he owes to Barbarosa's continued presence -- a presence he reinforces with consciously symbolic storytelling to the awed children destined to sustain the myth unto the next generation. In a story made up of intertwining lives & families, in many ways the strongest relationship is the one between Barbarosa & Don Braulio.At one point we're even treated to a scene of Barbarosa eavesdropping on someone singing a new song about Barbarosa's latest exploit, already inflated beyond what we'd previously witnessed onscreen. Barbarosa is flattered, amused -- after hearing a particularly good line, he mutters in admiration, ""Son of a b*tch can write!"" -- until the song comes to the part where they kill Barbarosa. The way Nelson's face & voice both go flat speaks volumes. Barbarosa knows that he's trapped in his own myth, which he's help to perpetuate, and that he's got to play it out to the end.And let's not forget the importance of the blistering, wide-open landscape, which is practically another personality itself. The cinematography gives us the desert, the mountains, the plains in heat-soaked color & grandeur, an eternal & timeless country strong enough to bear the weight of legendary men.It's hard to believe this film isn't better known. It has everything you could want from a great story: romance, tragedy, picaresque humor, startling shifts from the everyday to the extraordinary. And the actors give it their all, with plenty to spare. To top it off, it has one of the best, most joyous, make-the-hair-on-your-skin-stand-up-straight endings I've ever seen in a film. Most highly recommended!(The previous reviewers are right about the crying need for a widescreen version of this DVD. This film absolutely demands it.
