She is Baya (the very beautiful Sara Forestier), a free spirited, very attractive girl in her early twenties. Her mother is a leftist hippie, her father is an Algerian immigrant. She has followed the politics of her mother, and she tries to get into bed with right wingers, in order to convert them to a progressive outlook. He is Arthur (Jacques Gamblin) a shy, mild mannered, middle aged minor public bureaucrat. He denies being a right winger (since he voted for the moderate socialist candidate Lionel Jospin, who by the way has a cameo appearance in the movie) but he comes from a very staid family. His father is a respected engineer in the politically incorrect field of nuclear energy, his mother is the daughter of a survivor in Auschwitz (when Baya learns of his family background, she is excited at the possibility of becoming an Arab-Jewish couple, but he plays down his Jewish connections).

If there is anything special, it is the charming, over the top performance of Sara Forestier as a (very) sexy, Arab wild child who likes sleeping with conservative men so that she can change their opinions to liberal ones.  One of her conquests is a tight older Jewish man whose job is to medically study dead birds. The idea that she is an Arab and he is Jew delights her.The movie explores the nature of identity and the meaning of names...of course. It also touches upon liberal and conventional politics, racial bias, genocide, child sexual molestation...but only in a superficial way.  The movie is much too uneven. Truly interesting issues are tossed into a salad of the absurd.  When the movie works it is because of the actress in the lead role.  Yes, Sara Forestier won France's Cesar award for best actress...she is fun to watch.  She embodies vitality. But seriously, folks, this is a romantic fantasy!Obviously, the man falls in love and then...If you want a truly clever comedy that delves into Arab/Jewish prejudices - and a funnier one at that - try the Spanish ""Only Human"" about the visit of a Palestinian intellectual to his prospective in laws - a truly zany Jewish family.

Lane ""professional audience member""","[5, 5]","""Le nom des gens,"" a delightful award-winning French comedy (English captions) is available from Amazon.com. It features a young extrovert whose life's mission is to convert conservative men to her left-wing point of view. She does this by seducing them, feeling that they are most open to new beliefs during intimacy.This film is laugh-out-loud funny in many ways and more sweetly subtle in others. One example is during a voiceover when our hero describes his parents. We notice right away that the man who represents his father is far, far older than his mother. Then he explains that he could never picture his father as a young man, so that character always stays the same age.We see:*Jacques Gamblin (""The First Man"") as Arthur Martin, which evidently is the same name as a kitchen appliance. Any time his name comes up, he has to explain that he is not that Arthur Martin. He may be conservative, but he is bewitched by this hedonistic beauty who sails into his life and leaves him tattered in her wake. Gamblin was nominated for a Best Actor award at the 2010 C&eacute;sars, the French Academy Awards.*Sara Forestier (""Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life"") is Baya Benmahmoud, dedicated to righting the wrongs in this world by seducing ""fascists."" Problem is, by her definition, pretty much every man she meets is a fascist. Forestier won Best Actress at the 2010 C&eacute;sars.We meet HIS parents, conservative (and closeted) Jews; HER parents (Mom is a hippie and Dad is an Algerian handyman); plus younger versions of our two lovers. Her younger self had piano lessons but the teacher neglected to teach her any music, he was far more interested in HER; he left town when her parents found out. His younger self is torn between admitting his Jewish heritage to attract girls, or keeping his mouth shut to please his parents.Written and directed by Michel Leclerc (along with his wife Baya Kasmi, they won a 2010 C&eacute;sar for Best Screenplay), we see LOTS of nudity that is so natural we forget to be shocked. We see random acts of kindness that warm our hearts, and we see adult children who really care about their parents.Deep down, these are really nice people and we want them to be happy.

One really funny scene is when she goes home to take a shower, but gets so distracted by multiple phone calls, that she leaves and rides the metro without remembering to get dressed again.Another funny scene requires a bit of knowledge about how the French vote.  At French elections, the voter is given slips of paper, each paper with a candidate's name on it.  To vote for a candidate, the voter puts the slip with the candidate's name on it in the voting machine.
