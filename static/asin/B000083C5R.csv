A group of young people simply must trespass on GENTECH's property, so they can drink beer and smoke pot. They have no idea that the government is carrying out dangerous biological experiments there! Not surprisingly, something goes horribly wrong in the GENTECH lab, and the THC / alcohol-laden teens are in big trouble! Before they can say &#34;Pass that doobie!&#34;, flesh-consuming zombies arise, and begin seeking warm food! A group of anti-GENTECH protesters have broken into the facility, and they're the first to feel the sharp pain of living dead teeth! No one is safe as the dead moan and meander their way through GENTECH. BIOHAZARDOUS is a bloody, ultra-cheeezy, low-budget film.

Then some teenagers get together and party and get drunk near the GENTECH lab. But then some idiot gets electricuted and the rest of the pre-pubscent kids seek medical help for him by taking him in the GENTECH lab (DUR DEE DUR). While this is going on, some pigs are investigating GENTECH and then they all find themselves battling zombies and some guy who runs or owns the GENTECH lab and an angry fat mega-zombie. OR whatever.

However, this movie is still fun and why do people compare to crap like Resident Evil? Paul W.S.
