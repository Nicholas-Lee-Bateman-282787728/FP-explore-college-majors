This is just another one of the same basic story, with nothing particularly innovative or new.  Therefore, this is just another average such movie.  However, I am grading it down a full grade because of the utterly unnecessary use of swear words, not by the adults, but by the kids as well.  It isn't often, but there is no excuse for such language in what purports to be a family movie.  Also, in one instance Ashley suggests that one of the young boys has been ""playing with himself.""  Why is that in a supposed family movie?

The movie goes downhill from there.  I truly believe that the producers ran out of time, and were told to ""just put it out anyway.""  The loose ends in this film are numerous.

865243,A3MNJL4ROH6LRW,B0006D3HCO,Don R. Holloway,"[1, 1]","""Magic in the Water"" is a fantasy movie about a family from Seattle who goes on vacation to a small community in Northern Canada. This community is a tourist attraction because it is supposedly the home of a ""mythological"" creature called Orky. The father (Mark Harmon) is a psychiatrist with his own call-in radio show. He only brought his two kids (Joshua Jackson, Sarah Wayne) on this vacation to please his wife. He mostly ignores the kids until his ""encounter"" with the ""creature."" I did not think Mark Harmon was really believable as the father. It's just my opinion, but he seems miscast in this role. His daughter Ashley (Wayne) loves the beauty of the lake and trees and tries to get her brother and father interested, but they just complain about how bored they are. I believe the reason this movie works is because of the way it gets us to suspend our beliefs and for a little while accept the fact that there are things we don't understand about nature and life and fantasies. The real magic in this movie comes from the extraordinarily charming and believable performance by the beautiful young actress Sarah Wayne. She elicits a sense of wonder through her desire to believe that the creature is real. Her enthusiasm is infectious and we find ourselves joining her in her adventure. I don't want to reveal any other details about the events of the movie. I'd rather the viewer had the pleasure of doing this for themselves.There are more than a few similarities between ""Magic in the Water"" and another movie ""Mee-shee the Water Giant,"" although the movies were released ten years apart. First, they are both Canadian movies. Second, the creatures in both movies have a similiar appearance, although they were not created by the same people. Third, both creatures live in a cave below the surface of a lake. Fourth, both creatures are threatened by ""outsiders."" Fifth, just as Wayne is the ""magic"" in ""Magic in the Water,"" the young and very talented (and cute) Daniel Magder is the star and the ""magic"" in ""Mee-Shee."" Sixth, and lastly, both movies received Dove Awards from the Dove Foundation. Watch both movies back-to-back and see what you think. I already have.In conclusion, don't let the negative parts of my review desuade you from watching ""Magic in the Water."" I was only trying to fulfill my obligation as a reviewer by including these statements. It is definitely worth watching. And as much as I liked it, I could not bring myself to give it five stars. I really didn't think it was at a five-star level. But I still recommend it highly. So, go find the movie and search for your own magic. While you're out, look for ""Mee-Shee"" and make it a double feature. It doesn't get any better than this. And don't forget the popcorn.",4,The Magic is Really in the Young Girl's Heart,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,2753,"['Magic', 'Water', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'family', 'Seattle', 'who', 'vacation', 'small', 'community', 'Northern', 'Canada', 'community', 'tourist', 'attraction', 'supposedly', 'home', 'mythological', 'creature', 'called', 'Orky', 'father', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'psychiatrist', 'own', 'call-in', 'radio', 'show', 'only', 'brought', 'two', 'kids', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'Sarah', 'Wayne', 'vacation', 'please', 'wife', 'mostly', 'kids', 'encounter', 'creature', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'Mark', 'Harmon', 'was', 'really', 'believable', 'father', 'just', 'opinion', 'miscast', 'role', 'daughter', 'Ashley', 'Wayne', 'beauty', 'lake', 'trees', 'tries', 'get', 'brother', 'father', 'interested', 'just', 'complain', 'how', 'bored', 'are', 'believe', 'reason', 'movie', 'way', 'suspend', 'beliefs', 'little', 'fact', 'are', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'nature', 'life', 'fantasies', 'real', 'magic', 'movie', 'extraordinarily', 'charming', 'believable', 'performance', 'beautiful', 'young', 'actress', 'Sarah', 'Wayne', 'sense', 'wonder', 'desire', 'believe', 'creature', 'real', 'enthusiasm', 'infectious', 'find', 'joining', 'adventure', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'other', 'details', 'events', 'movie', ""'d"", 'rather', 'viewer', 'had', 'pleasure', 'doing', 'are', 'more', 'few', 'similarities', 'Magic', 'Water', 'movie', 'Mee-shee', 'Water', 'Giant', 'movies', 'were', 'released', 'ten', 'years', 'apart', 'First', 'are', 'Canadian', 'movies', 'Second', 'creatures', 'movies', 'have', 'similiar', 'appearance', 'were', 'not', 'created', 'same', 'people', 'Third', 'creatures', 'live', 'cave', 'surface', 'lake', 'Fourth', 'creatures', 'are', 'threatened', 'outsiders', 'Fifth', 'just', 'Wayne', 'magic', 'Magic', 'Water', 'young', 'very', 'talented', 'cute', 'Daniel', 'Magder', 'star', 'magic', 'Mee-Shee', 'Sixth', 'lastly', 'movies', 'received', 'Dove', 'Awards', 'Dove', 'Foundation', 'Watch', 'movies', 'back-to-back', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'already', 'have.In', 'conclusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'negative', 'parts', 'review', 'desuade', 'watching', 'Magic', 'Water', 'was', 'only', 'trying', 'fulfill', 'obligation', 'reviewer', 'including', 'statements', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'as', 'much', 'liked', 'could', 'not', 'bring', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'five-star', 'level', 'still', 'recommend', 'highly', 'So', 'go', 'find', 'movie', 'search', 'own', 'magic', ""'re"", 'out', 'look', 'Mee-Shee', 'make', 'double', 'feature', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'popcorn']",Magic in the Water
