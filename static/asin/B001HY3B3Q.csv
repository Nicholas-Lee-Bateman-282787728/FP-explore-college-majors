1202608,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B001HY3B3Q,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[1, 2]","John Carter's 2009 drama, ""Way of War"" was marketed about as badly as a film could be, when it was released, touted as an 'action/revenge' movie along the lines of ""First Blood"" and ""Shooter"". When audiences discovered that it was actually a rather heavy, often confusing drama of a man gradually losing his humanity as everything he loves and believes in is stripped away from him, they avoided the film in droves. While the DVD has been promoted along the same lines, at least you now have the opportunity to savor the terrific performances of J.K. Simmons, Clarence Williams III, and especially Cuba Gooding Jr., who gives one of his least gimmicky, most heart-felt performances in the lead.I've always admired Gooding, whose career was nearly derailed when he won the 'Supporting Actor' Oscar for ""Jerry Maguire"", at 28. With his boyish demeanor and voice, and his boundless energy, he was quickly 'typed' into silly roles that damaged his credibility as a serious actor. His better dramatic work was often ignored, or wound up being 'direct to video'. Surprisingly, ""Way of War"" didn't suffer that fate (as it really isn't that good), but at 41, Gooding's youthful features have hardened, and the pain and years have given him a dramatic credence that makes his character 'work'. As a career soldier assigned to Covert Ops, his training and beliefs are shattered when his friends are lost, and he discovers the corruption behind his last mission. Twisted in silent pain and rage, he first demands money for his part of the operation, then, when the woman he loves is executed, and he is 'leashed' and targeted for assassination (as a false story of the mission is publicized), he hardens into a self-appointed tool of justice, the living embodiment of Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War"". It is a challenging role, and Gooding carries it off very well.Sadly, the film doesn't measure up as well as his performance. Frequent flashbacks not only interrupt the dramatic continuity, but confuse the storyline, as well, and the few 'action' scenes lack credibility (the final mission, in particular, is so poorly conceived that you'll wonder how we ever lasted this long in the Middle East). The finale offers little in the way of closure, and even implies that an unwelcome sequel might be made. Whether the blame should fall on Carter's direction, or his muddy screenplay (with Scott Schafer), the film simply doesn't work.""Way of War"" makes a better rental than addition to your DVD collection, but, hopefully, it will remind the industry that Cuba Gooding is ready for better roles!",3,"Unsuccessful Drama, But Gooding shines...",1260835200,"12 15, 2009",2009,2577,"['John', 'Carter', '2009', 'drama', 'Way', 'War', 'was', 'marketed', 'as', 'badly', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'touted', ""'action/revenge"", 'movie', 'lines', 'First', 'Blood', 'Shooter', 'When', 'audiences', 'discovered', 'was', 'actually', 'rather', 'heavy', 'often', 'confusing', 'drama', 'man', 'gradually', 'losing', 'humanity', 'everything', 'stripped', 'away', 'avoided', 'film', 'droves', 'DVD', 'been', 'promoted', 'same', 'lines', 'least', 'now', 'have', 'opportunity', 'savor', 'terrific', 'performances', 'J.K.', 'Simmons', 'Clarence', 'Williams', 'III', 'especially', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'Jr.', 'who', 'one', 'least', 'gimmicky', 'most', 'heart-felt', 'performances', 'lead.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'admired', 'Gooding', 'career', 'was', 'nearly', 'derailed', 'when', 'won', ""'Supporting"", 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', '28', 'boyish', 'demeanor', 'voice', 'boundless', 'energy', 'was', 'quickly', ""'typed"", 'silly', 'roles', 'damaged', 'credibility', 'serious', 'actor', 'better', 'dramatic', 'work', 'was', 'often', 'ignored', 'wound', 'up', 'being', ""'direct"", 'video', 'Surprisingly', 'Way', 'War', 'did', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'fate', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', '41', 'Gooding', 'youthful', 'features', 'have', 'hardened', 'pain', 'years', 'have', 'given', 'dramatic', 'credence', 'character', ""'work"", 'career', 'soldier', 'assigned', 'Covert', 'Ops', 'training', 'beliefs', 'are', 'shattered', 'when', 'friends', 'are', 'lost', 'corruption', 'last', 'mission', 'Twisted', 'silent', 'pain', 'rage', 'first', 'money', 'part', 'operation', 'then', 'when', 'woman', 'executed', ""'leashed"", 'targeted', 'assassination', 'false', 'story', 'mission', 'publicized', 'self-appointed', 'tool', 'justice', 'living', 'embodiment', 'Sun', 'Tzu', 'Art', 'War', 'challenging', 'role', 'Gooding', 'off', 'very', 'well.Sadly', 'film', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'performance', 'Frequent', 'flashbacks', 'not', 'only', 'interrupt', 'dramatic', 'continuity', 'confuse', 'storyline', 'as', 'well', 'few', ""'action"", 'scenes', 'lack', 'credibility', 'final', 'mission', 'particular', 'so', 'poorly', 'conceived', ""'ll"", 'wonder', 'how', 'ever', 'lasted', 'long', 'Middle', 'East', 'finale', 'offers', 'little', 'way', 'closure', 'even', 'implies', 'unwelcome', 'sequel', 'might', 'be', 'made', 'blame', 'should', 'fall', 'Carter', 'direction', 'muddy', 'screenplay', 'Scott', 'Schafer', 'film', 'simply', ""n't"", 'work', 'Way', 'War', 'better', 'rental', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'hopefully', 'will', 'remind', 'industry', 'Cuba', 'Gooding', 'ready', 'better', 'roles']",N/A

It's got almost no coherent plot line and the action scenes are just stupid. Furthermore, the ending is horrible and leaves the viewer wondering what happened to the rest of the movie.The basic plot is that paramilitary operative David Wolfe uncovers a plot between Osama Bin Laden and the U.S. government to keep him alive because the government needs ""enemies"" to create heroes.The problem is, that ""message"" is all there is to this movie. Without the information on the back of the DVD case I could have never figured out who Gooding's character worked for, and it's still never made clear if he's working on behalf of the U.S. government or if there are rogue elements in the government who hatched this plot to keep Bin Laden alive.The action scenes which are supposed to take place in Pakistan are also simply stupid. They don't clear a room in any way that's believable for anybody who's even just watched it done in other movies. The other action scenes that take place in DC are also done horribly. Characters die, sometimes in violent ways, and there's no real reason given for it.If a director and screen writer want to make a movie that alleges the U.S. government is involved in some sort of conspiracy, at least make it believable.

The artwork is deceiving as this is not a military action film and the few surviving ""shootouts"" were corny, and funny enough, looked unrehearsed.Aside form the four different time lines being intertwined into a ""suspensful"" story, the plot involves US government higher-ups coordinating an operation to kill the ""Ace of Spades"" (not Saddam, but Osama) whilst really hiding their motives in some convoluted conspiracy. As Cuba tries to uncover the plot he manages to listen to pointless characters talk for hours on end about their war philosophy. JK Simmons does manage to spout some fun lines on war and such, but his scenes are forced and the gun they gave him was way too heavy for him. He is always fun to watch though.Customers have repeatedly gotten bored with it, and general feedback has been average to below average as a film, and with that lame ending one feels a loss at having watched this.

The director incorporates several flashbacks that don't make much sense to the main story line until the the end of the movie and then so much has passed in the main story that it almost feels as an unwanted diversion.

It seems like some of Cuba's recent performances have been phoned in while others efforts are full fledged. This is definitely one of his best performances. His character goes through a myriad of emotions while being chased by a corrupt faction of the American government. While on a paramilitary mission in the Middle East, David Wolfe discovers an international conspiracy connecting presidential cabinet members to a shady plot. Upon return, he is confronted with the choice to run or fight. Cuba continues to be one of the most talented actors of our time when he tries; WAY OF WAR is no exception. You really feel for his character.  Cuba isn't the only thing that sold me on the release... The storyline is intriguing and really makes you question the militaristic intentions of the United States. No matter what side of the fence you fall on regarding our current military situation, pro or anti combat, this movie asks some tough questions that demand answers.
