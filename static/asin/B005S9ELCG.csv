1500396,AAZRWLML88IZK,B005S9ELCG,A kids review,"[5, 6]","The Way is sort of the epitome of a passion project. Named for the Camino de Santiago, or Way of St. James, a traditional Spanish pilgrimage to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, the film was initially inspired by the travels of director Emilio Estevez's father and son when they undertook the journey themselves. When Estevez decided he wanted to make a film about the Camino de Santiago, he wrote a part specifically for his father, then shot the entire thing on location with a small crew over 40 days and 200 miles. In the film, Martin Sheen plays a grieving father whose son lost his life while on the titular pilgrimage; he initially travels to Spain merely to retrieve the body, but decides to embark on the journey himself, meeting others on the trek who are all searching for some meaning themselves. While I felt the film meandered a bit and teetered on oversentimentality, I also felt it was a noble effort by Estevez, beautifully shot and powerfully introspective at its best.",4,The Way,1329782400,"02 21, 2012",2012,994,"['Way', 'sort', 'epitome', 'passion', 'project', 'Named', 'Camino', 'de', 'Santiago', 'Way', 'St.', 'James', 'traditional', 'Spanish', 'pilgrimage', 'Cathedral', 'Santiago', 'de', 'Compostela', 'film', 'was', 'initially', 'inspired', 'travels', 'director', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'father', 'son', 'when', 'undertook', 'journey', 'When', 'Estevez', 'decided', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'Camino', 'de', 'Santiago', 'wrote', 'part', 'specifically', 'father', 'then', 'shot', 'entire', 'thing', 'location', 'small', 'crew', '40', 'days', '200', 'miles', 'film', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'grieving', 'father', 'son', 'lost', 'life', 'titular', 'pilgrimage', 'initially', 'Spain', 'merely', 'retrieve', 'body', 'embark', 'journey', 'meeting', 'others', 'trek', 'who', 'are', 'searching', 'meaning', 'felt', 'film', 'meandered', 'bit', 'teetered', 'oversentimentality', 'also', 'felt', 'was', 'noble', 'effort', 'Estevez', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'powerfully', 'introspective', 'best']",N/A

1500403,AYWHCM0TJ4737,B005S9ELCG,Ana Braga-Henebry,"[5, 6]","So you should read this only if you have seen the film already.I liked the film, which has has been praised by many, and it undoubtedly has some great points: perhaps they make the film worth watching just for themselves:- the wonderful photography of the holy images of the Camino de Compostela, including the statuary along the way and the gorgeous basilica's interiors and Mass.- a strong, beautifully executed pro-life message, through the character of the one woman in the group of friends who talks about how her abortion early in life has marked her life- the character of the French gendarme, my favorite character in the film, a man of deep faith, full of understanding, respect, and kindness towards the newcomer, suffering AmericanAlas, I found also a number of problems in the film. Starting with the blatant: I refer to the casual, not-recommended treatment Martin Sheen demonstrates with his son's ashes. It is not difficult to find the Church's position on this. So no, taking his son's ashes in a Ziploc bag inside a box in your backpack and scattering them along the way is definitely not recommended.Then there is the issue of the characters Martin Sheen befriends along the way. From what I read, there are indeed representative of the people on the Camino, if all a bit flat and stereotypical: a Canadian woman hurting inside from past problems, a Dutch man attempting to lose weight, an Irishman undergoing writer's block. Well, for one thing, yes, after walking 800 kms the Dutch man would have lost some of his stomach for sure. The Canadian woman swears the whole way she will give up smoking when she gets to ""the feet of saint James"", but the viewer already knows she will not quit. The Irishman does conquer his writer's block as he begin writing about Martin Sheen's personal journey, but of all of the characters he is the most forced one. His entry into the story is short of a theatrical caricature. Let's say if you or I met someone acting like that we would keep walking.Another problem is the very premise of the film: ""You don't choose a life, you live it"". Good grief, and what exactly does that mean? I beg to disagree. We absolutely make choices for our life, the question is not if we choose it or not, but what choices we do make, and how. A no-brainer here.But what about Martin Sheen? What about his character, a wealthy, California doctor who had just  lived a very routine life so far? We are to believe that he is transformed, that his impulsive desire to take his son's ashes and scatter them through the Camino, accomplishing for him what his premature death made impossible, is a personal journey of discovery. Discovery of what exactly? The film seems to hint that he discovers himself and therefore God, or at least Love: he gets over, if reluctantly, of his closeness and anger, he begins caring for his newfound friends, and he evens hints to a priest along the way that his gift of a Rosary has ""come in handy"" (although that is not shown), and finally he is seen praying at the basilica, kneeling.Finally, what crowned my problems about the film is the very end. The final, five second scene. After trekking with this man for almost 900 km we are to believe he has undergone this transformation. He now is a human being who has let go of his hangups, who has found God or at least Love. What would I like to see him doing? I know exactly what I would like to see him doing: I would like to see him going back to his responsible life of a caring doctor (which he was shown to be in the beginning of the film), now taking with him this newfound dimension of Love of Neighbor. So instead of wasting hours playing golf with his obnoxious friends I would like to see him choosing instead to volunteer at the Soup Kitchen, caring for other's problems and needs in a personal way, praying and being active in his parish, or doing similar works of charity. That is our calling, and a hard one, to do God's work where our life happens to be. So I'd like to him taking and applying to his daily life what he gained from the journey in the Camino. Instead, he is shown walking aimlessly, hippie-like, alone, through the streets of Morocco. Uh? How is that the life of someone who found true Love?Like I said, I like the film, but I find that reviewers are usually very generous on their takes of Hollywood productions, more so than with books. Does this stem from low expectations?

It took me a while to sit down and finally watch it, but I'm very glad I did.The story-line is fairly straight-forward and the movie doesn't deviate much from the central theme. If nothing else, the movie was literally filmed along the pilgrimage, and thus, the scenery is incredible. Most of the other walkers in the film aren't 'extras,' but rather, they were actually doing the walk as the film was being made. Even some of the characters in the movie (the sheepherder, for example), were locals.I found myself touched by this movie, and was often tearful, if only out of sympathy for Sheen.Once one completes the walk, they are asked a central question. I won't tell you what that question is, but for our main character, I'm not sure it was ever answered, and if anything, only barely inferred. I hope I didn't miss something.Anyhow, the characters in the film are likeable, and though we get a window into their own motives for doing the walk, it never clouds Sheen's role. Granted, this film isn't a polished, Hollywood flick, but its simplicity fits with the whole aura of the Santiago.I'm glad that I watched it, and it was great having visuals to put to the books I've read thus far on the Santiago de Compestela.Goodjob, Estevez!",4,"Touching, Delightful, Easy to Watch",1338681600,"06 3, 2012",2012,1547,"['do', ""n't"", 'anticipate', 'doing', 'trek', 'lately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'reading', 'books', 'written', 'who', 'have', 'walked', 'Way', 'St', 'James', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Spain', 'few', 'times', 'only', 'recently', 'heard', 'journey.In', 'midst', 'looking', 'other', 'books', 'topic', 'stumbled', 'movie', 'took', 'while', 'sit', 'down', 'finally', 'watch', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did.The', 'story-line', 'fairly', 'straight-forward', 'movie', ""n't"", 'deviate', 'much', 'central', 'theme', 'nothing', 'else', 'movie', 'was', 'literally', 'filmed', 'pilgrimage', 'thus', 'scenery', 'incredible', 'Most', 'other', 'walkers', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", ""'extras"", 'rather', 'were', 'actually', 'doing', 'walk', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'Even', 'characters', 'movie', 'sheepherder', 'example', 'were', 'locals.I', 'found', 'touched', 'movie', 'was', 'often', 'tearful', 'only', 'sympathy', 'Sheen.Once', 'one', 'walk', 'are', 'asked', 'central', 'question', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'question', 'main', 'character', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'ever', 'answered', 'anything', 'only', 'barely', 'inferred', 'hope', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'something.Anyhow', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'likeable', 'get', 'window', 'own', 'motives', 'doing', 'walk', 'never', 'Sheen', 'role', 'Granted', 'film', ""n't"", 'polished', 'Hollywood', 'flick', 'simplicity', 'fits', 'whole', 'aura', 'Santiago.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', 'was', 'great', 'having', 'visuals', 'put', 'books', ""'ve"", 'read', 'thus', 'far', 'Santiago', 'de', 'Compestela.Goodjob', 'Estevez']",N/A

Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[223, 230]","My eyes were wet and I laughed out loud in the first fifteen minutes of ""The Way,"" and I continued laughing and crying throughout. I left the theater feeling the generous glow that a good movie inspires. I'll now be telling everyone I know to see this film, on a big screen, and I'm already looking forward to seeing it again.I was a bit anxious about ""The Way."" I anticipated so many ways a movie that features backpacking, pilgrimages, and religion could go wrong. Would it be excessively pious and maudlin? New Age-y and Christophobic? Simply a bad movie? There is a reason so many films focus on graphic, intimate scenes and explosions: those are easy to shoot and they arouse viewer interest. ""The Way"" rapidly calmed my anxiety. It's a honey of a movie.Tom (Martin Sheen) is a sixty-something ophthalmologist. His son Dan (Emilio Estevez) dies in an accident. Tom travels to France to retrieve his son's body. Learning of his son's attempt to walk the camino, Tom decides to cremate his son's remains and carry them as he fulfills his son's plan.Tom walks through picturesque, mountainous countryside and through the plazas of old towns. As happens when one is traveling, Tom encounters an assortment of eclectic characters. Joost (Yorick van Wageningen) is a corpulent, talkative, pot smoking Dutchman who is walking the trail to lose weight. Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger) is a sharp tongued, very angry Canadian blonde. Jack (James Nesbitt) is an Irish travel writer with the gift of gab - he didn't just kiss the Blarney Stone, he went steady with it. There is a priest with a brain tumor who distributes rosaries, and pilgrims debating the roles of the French, the Spanish and the Basque in ancient battles against invading Moors. Waiters take very strong stands on tapas. Gypsies defend their honor.The pilgrims sleep in spare hostel dormitories with snoring, coughing, shooshing roommates. They visit churches and enact rituals.There was a moment in this movie in which I, a traveler and backpacker, was one hundred percent engaged. In superhero movies, I don't really care if the superhero gets the dilithium crystals to the giant spider. In this movie, a backpacker drops his pack into a rushing river that rapidly sweeps it toward the sea. THAT scene commanded my full engagement. The backpacker's pack contains his entire world, his heart, his safety, his entertainment, his identity, his survival. I was on the edge of my seat.What happens in the movie is what happens when you travel, and when you pray. The demands of travel bring forth bonding rituals - I'll listen to your rant; you'll bail me out of jail - that create intimacy with unexpected, and all too temporary, companions. There are sudden and heart-wrenching confessions that make two strangers more intimate than family members. There are little triumphs that make it all worthwhile - finding orange trees laden with fruit after a night of sleeping on cold ground, one night in a five-star hotel after punishing weeks of self-denial.Martin Sheen is so convincing as Tom I really lost the sense of watching a movie. Tom is a man of few words or gestures, and Sheen's every subdued facial expression carries weight and feeling. I had the sense of those who interacted with Tom that I would appreciate a mere word from him more than a paragraph from someone less grounded and sincere.I really disliked Joost at first, and, come to think of it, many of the other characters, as well, but the film, without any visible effort, brought me to appreciate them the way you can come to appreciate someone you've shared the road with. When Joost is asked why he is walking the trail and he finally tells why, it is a very poignant, precious moment, so utterly believable it could have been in a well-made documentary. Van Wageningen will receive many love letters from women who cannot separate him from Joost, a fictional character so believable he makes you want to hug him. James Nesbitt could be extemporizing his lines, they feel so lived-in. Deborah Kara Unger gives new life to an ancient prayer.I wish the movie had done a couple of things it did not. I just did not believe that Tom could immediately begin walking the camino in anything but a halting fashion. Many non-hiker friends have called me the day after a hike with me to tell me that their feet are so covered with blisters they can't put on shoes, and their muscles are so sore they can't move (the big babies.) I would have liked to have seen Tom breaking his body in to the demands of the trail. I also would have liked to have seen even just a brief scene where he purchased footwear. Very few ophthalmologists cross the Atlantic with the proper footwear for a walk hundreds of kilometers long, and footwear is a big deal for a walker. I would like to have seen the walkers interact with their packs, something that all hikers do - a tightening of the belt strap here, a loosening of the shoulder strap there. They become a part of your body.I wish the direction and cinematography had done something more with the countryside and the historic plazas and churches, which are always shown in a way that is pretty, but not innovative. I wish we learned a bit about the keepers of the refugios, the hostels where pilgrims spend the night. To the pilgrims, the towns change every day. To the towns, the pilgrims change every day. How do these dovetailing experiences illuminate each other? And I wish more had been said about religion, although what little is said is intriguing and implies worlds of meaning. I wish more had been said about the alleged sacredness of some places.These are minor complaints. This film is destined to become a much beloved classic. See it.",5,Beautiful and Special.

1500454,AACEZE2YPTJ5D,B005S9ELCG,D. Kanigan,"[5, 5]","I recommend ""The Way"" for anyone looking for a light, funny, feel-good movie on a rainy Sunday. Basic no-surprise plot. Good casting buckled with very good soundtrack, humor, captivating vistas and mouth watering food scenes. And the lead character (Martin Sheen) is, like me, an acknowledged ""Believer of Convenience"" (Easter, Christmas) so the flick resonated with me.  The 2-minute trailer on YouTube captures the plot nicely.Story: Tom (played by Martin Sheen) is a 60+ year old ophthalmologist who learns that his 40 year old estranged son dies on Pilgrimage in Northwest Spain (El Camino de Santiago).  He travels to identify and retrieve his son. He decides to take two months off work after learning about the Pilgrimage.  On his journey, he runs into Yost (a large, kind-hearted, funny Dutchman), Sarah (a sharp tongued French Canadian beauty) and Jack (an Irish writer).  They each have their own non-religious personal reasons for making the pilgrimage yet they each exit the trek with it having left a profound impact on them.  No cliffhangers on this plot - fairly straightforward - but the packaging makes it enticing.Music: Loved it.  Including but not limited to James Taylor (""Walking Down the Country Road""); Nick Drake (""Pink Moon""); Alanis Morissette (""Thank you"") and David Gray (""My Oh My"").Food: What's not to like.

Darsow,"[1, 1]","This extraordinary movie is earned a 4/5 stars, because of the emotions touch your heart, inspires you to live your life spontaneously, and teaches about friendship that overcome addictions and insecurities.The Way is based upon a true story. Which takes place on the El Comina trial. A guy in about his mid twenties decided to do the trial and he dies the first day. That's when his father had to go up there and identify his sons body. Now there is no telling what he will do.I purchased this movie during March of 2012 out of a Red box. Truthfully, I've only seen this movie once but that's all it took to touch me. This movie made me change my viewpoints about life.The Way contains great care of emotions, the first being about his sons death. This shows tons of emotions, because his father gets his sons body cremated. Then he decides to walk to trial and spread his ashes throughout the trial. This specific event that happened made me realize that everyone should do everything they want at least once before they die.Also, it shows inspiration, such as taking chance at new things. This inspired me because the son was chasing after his dreams, going to the places that have an impact in his life. But sadly he didn't make it past day one. He has encouraged me to not be afraid and made me realize that you always should be optimistic about life and have no regrets.Finally, it shows trustworthiness, dependable, and unjudgemental friendships between strangers.  It influenced me to look at people from the inside and always be there for someone in need because we all need a friend by our side.The only downside I've experienced so far was the lack of statistics. With more statistics it would've made the movie a little more heart touching. For instance, all throughout the movie I was wondering how long it took to walk the trial. But that is a mystery that will remain unknown.If you're looking for a film with people facing reality and surving their struggles, The Way is an excellent choice.Written by Courtney Harris",4,Inspirational and heart touching movie,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,2033,"['extraordinary', 'movie', 'earned', '4/5', 'stars', 'emotions', 'touch', 'heart', 'live', 'life', 'spontaneously', 'teaches', 'friendship', 'overcome', 'addictions', 'insecurities.The', 'Way', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Which', 'place', 'El', 'Comina', 'trial', 'guy', 'mid', 'twenties', 'decided', 'do', 'trial', 'first', 'day', 'when', 'father', 'had', 'go', 'up', 'there', 'identify', 'sons', 'body', 'Now', 'telling', 'what', 'will', 'do.I', 'purchased', 'movie', 'March', '2012', 'Red', 'box', 'Truthfully', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'movie', 'once', 'took', 'touch', 'movie', 'made', 'change', 'viewpoints', 'life.The', 'Way', 'great', 'care', 'emotions', 'first', 'being', 'sons', 'death', 'tons', 'emotions', 'father', 'sons', 'body', 'cremated', 'Then', 'walk', 'trial', 'spread', 'ashes', 'trial', 'specific', 'event', 'happened', 'made', 'realize', 'everyone', 'should', 'do', 'everything', 'want', 'least', 'once', 'die.Also', 'inspiration', 'such', 'taking', 'chance', 'new', 'things', 'inspired', 'son', 'was', 'chasing', 'dreams', 'going', 'places', 'have', 'impact', 'life', 'sadly', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'past', 'day', 'one', 'encouraged', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'made', 'realize', 'always', 'should', 'be', 'optimistic', 'life', 'have', 'regrets.Finally', 'trustworthiness', 'dependable', 'unjudgemental', 'friendships', 'strangers', 'influenced', 'look', 'people', 'inside', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'someone', 'need', 'need', 'friend', 'side.The', 'only', 'downside', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'lack', 'statistics', 'more', 'statistics', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'movie', 'little', 'more', 'heart', 'touching', 'instance', 'movie', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', 'long', 'took', 'walk', 'trial', 'mystery', 'will', 'remain', 'unknown.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'film', 'people', 'facing', 'reality', 'surving', 'struggles', 'Way', 'excellent', 'choice.Written', 'Courtney', 'Harris']",N/A
1500468,A58QBXO0HA2B4,B005S9ELCG,Fern,"[0, 2]","Being a trekker and hiker, I loved the plot of this movie: a successful US doctor/ophthalmologist decides to trek 800 miles from France to Spain after his son dies tragically just one day into the same quest. The combination of a father attempting to connect with his late son by finishing the journey his son never got to complete, along with beautiful outdoor scenery and the quirky characters and lessons they impart along the way had the makings of a great movie, but everything fell flat for me due to the bad acting of the main character and his three sidekicks on the trail.Martin Sheen is mostly expressionless, whether he's viewing his son's dead body, sprinkling his son's remains at various stops along the trail or doing anything else. Was it perhaps no accident that the director chose not to show Sheen's face when he learns through a phone call on the golf course that his son has died?

1500479,A1YTR8FI6UPMA6,B005S9ELCG,Get Serious,"[0, 1]","(Spoilers)This is a film about penance. Penance is a self-imposed punishment. Individuals seek out penance because of guilt of a wrongdoing some time in their lives, disatisfaction about who they are or who they have become or because the have come to believe they are inadequate; or perhaps they are just lost within a sense of what they believe life should be, yet have not yet attained. Penance stories have been written for millenia and you could write a million-page book concerning different aspects of millions of people, so they are easy to write. The film is basically a backpack through Europe, while staying at hostels story. Along the way four people end up walking together and we see their individual tortured stories. For those of us who have done this type of thing, primarily in the Third World, it certainly brings back memories of places we've been and people we have met. People tend to become fast friends when they face adversity together and share their personal tragedies and sometimes remain lifelong friends. For most Americans who have never been out of a five-star hotel or traveled overseas (particularly in the Third World), they probably won't get it! The film makes the viewer want to head out and explore in the most basic methodology...walking with a pack on your back. The story is filmed in France and Spain, so the walkers don't have to deal with disease and sickness, crime and overt alienation as those of us who have done the Third World. Believe it or not, but this type of thing also takes quite a bit of money. So not everyone can do this even if they want to. It is an anomoly that the producers chose Spain for soul-cleansing, a country which raped and murdered half the world under a caustic and corrupt religion!In the film we have the abused woman, who feels she has killed her baby in getting an abortion. We have the writer who has lost his muse and his hope and interest in life. We have the nice guy, who has been rejected by his wife. And we have the main character who in feeling guilt over never having connected with his son, decides to spread his dead son's ashes along the route he never got to take. It is interesting that at the end of the pilgrimage, none of the four has really 'solved' anything or really figured anything out, something which occurs to people who have actually done this; but then it's not the destination nor the purpose, but the actual journey which is the real raison de e'tre. In the end the main character, a stuffy opthamologist begins backpacking the world...the legacy from his son. So one of the four reaches resolution!Worth a look-see! Americans are the least foreign-traveled people on the entire planet. So they should seriously think about this!

His character works, for the most part, but he never quite seems to ""get it"".  At several points in the film I found myself thinking ""There, now he finally realizes that it's the Journey, not the Destination"".  And then, a few minutes later, as he stalks off ahead, Mr. Efficient American On A Mission, you realize, no, he doesn't get it.  One character puts it best when she wonders if he'll ever ""stop and smell the roses"".  It reminds me of the members of the party that ""discovered"" Yosemite;  so intent were they on getting in, and getting out, one later remarked ""if we'd known how famous it would become, we would have paid attention"".At the end of the movie he appears to be in Morocco, in a city that looks like a restored original set from ""Casablanca"", and he's still just a city guy out to get somewhere up ahead, not to smell the roses along the road.But, don't let that discourage you. Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez, his son, play a father and son with differing views of life;  the father makes his way as a successful California opthamologist and the son, growing up in the good life---it's not clear he has his own money---prefers traveling, treking across the world to find his way.  Nice work if you can get it, and don't die in the Pyranees (or going over Yosemite Falls, for that matter...)  So, after refusing his son's invitation to join him on this famous pilgrimage, he ends up having to go anyway, to reclaim his body, and seeing how much of the hike was left, decides to cremate his son's remains, and make the pilgrimage, himself, with his son's ashes.  It's in the early scenes, as Martin Sheen comes to terms with his loss, and FINALLY decides to do the right thing, by making the trek, that the film is at it's most poignant.  After that, it lightens up.The Irish writer remains irritating to the end, but I suppose it's better than having the stereotypical ""drunk Aussie"" drinking Fosters everywhere.  Mr. Sheen's character picks up an entourage of sorts;  a very disagreeable lot at first, save for the comical but ultimately useful Dutchman who's walking to lose weight, and who carries enough drugs to get himself locked up for a century;  a very angry Canadian (for a change), and the aforementioned Irish writer.For those afraid of such things, relax:  There's only one campfire discussion that is the least bit philosophical, relating in this case to what makes for a ""genuine"" pilgrim, and what degree of luxury would ruin the authenticity.  Like most such films these days, this is meant to be entertaining, and that's what it is;  thinking, unfortunately, is once again optional.So, yes, while Martin Sheen isn't quite convincing as a trekker---too focused on the destination and never seeming to realize the importance of the journey---that's but a slight drag on an otherwise light entertainment set in a gorgeous country-scape.",4,"Beautiful, Entertaining, Occasionally Poignant, Yet Not Quite Convincing Road Movie",1364428800,"03 28, 2013",2013,3003,"['movie', 'may', 'improve', 'viewing', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'basically', 'tied', 'up', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'performance', 'character', 'works', 'most', 'part', 'never', 'quite', 'get', 'several', 'points', 'film', 'found', 'thinking', 'now', 'finally', 'Journey', 'not', 'Destination', 'then', 'few', 'minutes', 'later', 'ahead', 'Mr', 'Efficient', 'American', 'Mission', 'realize', ""n't"", 'get', 'One', 'character', 'best', 'when', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'stop', 'smell', 'roses', 'members', 'party', 'discovered', 'Yosemite', 'so', 'intent', 'were', 'getting', 'getting', 'out', 'one', 'later', 'remarked', ""'d"", 'known', 'how', 'famous', 'would', 'become', 'would', 'have', 'paid', 'attention', 'end', 'movie', 'be', 'Morocco', 'city', 'restored', 'original', 'set', 'Casablanca', 'still', 'just', 'city', 'guy', 'get', 'somewhere', 'up', 'ahead', 'not', 'smell', 'roses', 'road.But', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'discourage', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'son', 'play', 'father', 'son', 'differing', 'views', 'life', 'father', 'way', 'successful', 'California', 'opthamologist', 'son', 'growing', 'up', 'good', 'life', '-it', 'not', 'clear', 'own', 'money', '-prefers', 'traveling', 'treking', 'world', 'find', 'way', 'Nice', 'work', 'can', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'die', 'Pyranees', 'going', 'Yosemite', 'Falls', 'matter', 'So', 'refusing', 'son', 'invitation', 'join', 'famous', 'pilgrimage', 'up', 'having', 'go', 'anyway', 'reclaim', 'body', 'seeing', 'how', 'much', 'hike', 'was', 'left', 'cremate', 'son', 'remains', 'make', 'pilgrimage', 'son', 'ashes', 'early', 'scenes', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'terms', 'loss', 'FINALLY', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'making', 'trek', 'film', 'most', 'poignant', 'up.The', 'Irish', 'writer', 'irritating', 'end', 'suppose', 'better', 'having', 'stereotypical', 'drunk', 'Aussie', 'drinking', 'Fosters', 'everywhere', 'Mr.', 'Sheen', 'character', 'up', 'entourage', 'sorts', 'very', 'disagreeable', 'lot', 'first', 'save', 'comical', 'ultimately', 'useful', 'Dutchman', 'who', 'walking', 'lose', 'weight', 'who', 'enough', 'drugs', 'get', 'locked', 'up', 'century', 'very', 'angry', 'Canadian', 'change', 'aforementioned', 'Irish', 'writer.For', 'afraid', 'such', 'things', 'relax', 'only', 'one', 'campfire', 'discussion', 'least', 'bit', 'philosophical', 'relating', 'case', 'what', 'genuine', 'pilgrim', 'what', 'degree', 'luxury', 'would', 'ruin', 'authenticity', 'most', 'such', 'films', 'days', 'meant', 'be', 'entertaining', 'what', 'thinking', 'unfortunately', 'once', 'again', 'optional.So', 'yes', 'Martin', 'Sheen', ""n't"", 'quite', 'convincing', 'trekker', '-too', 'focused', 'destination', 'never', 'seeming', 'realize', 'importance', 'journey', '-that', 'slight', 'drag', 'otherwise', 'light', 'entertainment', 'set', 'gorgeous', 'country-scape']",N/A

Not sure what message I'm getting out of the movie myself, but each character has their own emotional baggage that they literally carry on this journey.  To be honest, it's not a movie you wanna see over and over again, but it's a great film to watch with your father (if you're a son) if you guys have fallen out of communication with each other.  The visuals and scenery are really rich and beautiful and the music by Tyler Bates and various artists (although, you won't find Coldplay's ""Lost"" on the soundtrack) give the movie a nice drive.The reason why I'm giving this movie three stars, is of its bonus features.  The biggest feature (every extra is identical on the Blu Ray and DVD releases) is the commentary with Emilio Estevez, Martin Sheen, and producer David Alexanian.  Gives great background for the picture and points out things that are totally absent from the other special features.  The other features are as listed:Camino Americana: Taking The Way on the Road (about a 3 minute feature focusing on when The Way rolled its way into towns and theaters across the country.)Pilgrimage: Behind the Camera (about a 3 minute feature focusing on a little behind the scenes of a couple scenes.)Father & Son: Uncovering the Characters (about a 2 minute feature focusing on what Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez thought about their characters and what the characters go through in the movie.)Along the Way: The Journey of a Father and Son - a dual memoir by Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez (a text-only feature focusing on the memoir ""Along The Way"").I honestly wished there was A LOT more SUBSTANCE to the bonus features, but that's all we're getting right now.  But to hear Emilio's commentary is worth the price of the movie alone, and yes, like I said, both the DVD and the Blu Ray has both the SAME features.This is a film worth watching, even if once, but I'm sure the memoir when it gets released will have a bit more substance about Emilio's inspiration to make this movie, especially with his father, Martin Sheen.""Buen camino.""",5,5 Stars for The Way Movie / 3 Stars for the Blu Ray / DVD Features,1330128000,"02 25, 2012",2012,2072,"['really', 'loved', 'movie', 'Not', 'sure', 'what', 'message', ""'m"", 'getting', 'movie', 'character', 'own', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'literally', 'carry', 'journey', 'be', 'honest', 'not', 'movie', 'wan', 'see', 'over', 'again', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'father', ""'re"", 'son', 'guys', 'have', 'fallen', 'communication', 'other', 'visuals', 'scenery', 'are', 'really', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'music', 'Tyler', 'Bates', 'various', 'artists', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'Coldplay', 'Lost', 'soundtrack', 'give', 'movie', 'nice', 'drive.The', 'reason', 'why', ""'m"", 'giving', 'movie', 'three', 'stars', 'bonus', 'features', 'biggest', 'feature', 'extra', 'identical', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'DVD', 'releases', 'commentary', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'producer', 'David', 'Alexanian', 'great', 'background', 'picture', 'points', 'out', 'things', 'are', 'totally', 'absent', 'other', 'special', 'features', 'other', 'features', 'are', 'listed', 'Camino', 'Americana', 'Taking', 'Way', 'Road', '3', 'minute', 'feature', 'focusing', 'when', 'Way', 'rolled', 'way', 'towns', 'theaters', 'country', 'Pilgrimage', 'Camera', '3', 'minute', 'feature', 'focusing', 'little', 'scenes', 'couple', 'scenes', 'Father', 'Son', 'Uncovering', 'Characters', '2', 'minute', 'feature', 'focusing', 'what', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'thought', 'characters', 'what', 'characters', 'go', 'movie', 'Way', 'Journey', 'Father', 'Son', 'dual', 'memoir', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'text-only', 'feature', 'focusing', 'memoir', 'Way', '.I', 'honestly', 'wished', 'was', 'LOT', 'more', 'SUBSTANCE', 'bonus', 'features', ""'re"", 'getting', 'right', 'now', 'hear', 'Emilio', 'commentary', 'price', 'movie', 'alone', 'yes', 'said', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'SAME', 'features.This', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'even', 'once', ""'m"", 'sure', 'memoir', 'when', 'released', 'will', 'have', 'bit', 'more', 'substance', 'Emilio', 'inspiration', 'make', 'movie', 'especially', 'father', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Buen', 'camino']",N/A

I wasn't sure why. Still not sure. Nonetheless, I've seen it and love it!When an eye doctor gets news that his son, while on a life journey, has died during a storm, the eye doctor, Thomas Avery, goes out to honor his late son's journey. What he never expects is to make the journey with several others with unique backstories that will help him in ways he never imagined possible.Many may remember Emilio Estevez from films like The Breakfast Club, The Mighty Ducks, Maximum Overdrive, and Repo Man, but in this, he takes an entirely different direction (pun intended) and, thourhgout most of the film, appears as a hallucination of his father's grief. And, as the multiple hallucinations, never once speaks, yet the multiple times he's seen always have a beautiful meaning the time and place they appear. The couple times he's seen alive also have great value, but not quite as much substance as when he's a vision (I think that was intentional for sentimental value).The people Thomas Avery meets along the Way (Camino de Santiago) are a comic relief of a man that needs to lose weight before his brother's wedding, a woman with a smoking habit and a shocking secret that explains why she's so critical about everything, and an Irish writer trying to find inspiration and failing big-time until he meets the unlikely trio. Every single one of them creates as unique a group for a journey as L. Frank Baum made for The Wizard of Oz, and it is a beautiful, even if faulty, friendship none had expected to make.But it's not only the people that make the film what it is. There's also the natural beauty of the scenery everywhere they go (I'll admit, I get bored of watching movies with a strictly American setting, so it's a nice breather to occassionally watch a movie like this). But, more important to the story itself is not the scenery, per se, but the interactions with all the other groups of people they meet. Some, while not having as much screen time as the four-person group, present a personal beauty to the Thomas Avery's emotional scenes, including a Catholic Father with a scar that covers up and a handful of rosary beads, as well as a young Gypsy boy who takes Thomas' son's backpack, which sets up a profound meeting and talk with the boy's father about the importance of family and life with a great quote at the end (""It's not about religion. Not at all."")In ways, I felt connected to different characters for different reasons, even if not for the exact same reason in the exact same way, so it wasn't only Thomas Avery who came out of the journey different.Oh, and can't forget the humor throughout the movie. The film direction does an excellent job at appropriately separating the humor from the poignant drama, which felt entirely necessary in this trip of a lifetime.A lot of films that end up being ""inspirational"" tend to be marketed as ""Christian,"" which tends to turn people off. It's not fo that reason that I wouldn't call this film Christian, but it really is inspirational. It doesn't go too fast for characterization, nor goes too slow to indulge in the natural scenery, it goes a steady-enough pace for it to be completely impacting at the right moments, shocking also at the right moments, but doesn't stray into the all-too-familiar territory of an evangelical film trying to proselytize people to a religious institution (even if Martin Sheen is a devout Catholic), rather, it seems that the film's intention is to help people through the troubles of life and help them known there are others out there who need help and friends in their journey (or, pilgrimage of life, if you would). Due to the unique backgrounds of each character (an American, an Irish, a Canadian, and a Dutch), you get to see the world very differently, funny arguments about how each culture sees history differently, and not only from the main characters, but the ""random"" people they meet, some once, some a little more.Regardless of each person's faith or lack of faith, this was definitely the most inspirational film released last year I've seen that had nothing to do with the Bible, surprisingly enough, and that may very well be a good thing (as a self-proclaiming Christian, indie Christians films, to me, get to be an irritant with the formulas they use, none of which this film uses).This film uses an inspirational structure all its unique own, and that's why I loved it.",5,For the sake

Lane ""professional audience member""","[0, 0]","After some gentle urging from some of my JayFlix colleagues, I finally picked up a DVD of this expertly targeted movie from the library and viewed it. I say expertly targeted because it clearly speaks to a huge number of people who appreciate the redemption of an estranged father who reluctantly follows a path chosen by his (deceased) son.Adapting the book by Jack Hitt, ""Off the Road: A Modern-Day Walk Down the Pilgrim's Route Into Spain,"" Emilio Estevez has crafted a screenplay that features his father Martin Sheen as the modern-day pilgrim who takes his son's ashes along ""El camino de Santiago,"" in northern Spain. Also directed by Mr. Estevez, this satisfying little gem is sweet, funny and inspiring. It has been nominated for numerous awards.We see:* Martin Sheen (""Anger Management"" with his son Charlie Sheen) is a California ophthalmologist who decides on the spur of the moment to complete the trek his son had begun. Perhaps he will come to understand him a little better.* Emilio Estevez (lots of TV) in a few flashbacks plays the deceased son.* Deborah Kara Unger (""Crash"") is a Canadian peregrina whose sole purpose for this pilgrimage to quit smoking.* Yorick van Wageninger (""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" 2011) is a gregarious, pudgy fellow from the Netherlands. He wants to lose weight so he can fit into his old suit.* James Nesbitt (""Coriolanus"") is an Irish author suffering from writer's block.As time passes and the miles accumulate, a tentative foursome has formed. We see other peregrinos (pilgrims) and appreciate the warmth and hospitality extended by the Basques and Spaniards along the way. I couldn't help but notice the similarity to Canterbury Tales, and wonder where and how they kept themselves clean, how they adjusted to the cramped hostels in which they slept and the unusual food they ate. I very much enjoyed their reaction at one point, when they were given the luxury of individual hotel rooms.Treat yourself to a scenic stroll through an interesting countryside with occasional stops at way stations, hostels and cathedrals.

Yet they can't destroy this interesting little film. I saw a preview on some DVD a couple years back, and was intrigued, but assumed the usual Hollywood scoffing at religion would be on display, and journeys such as this could only be about enlightenment and personal spirituality.  But a person whom I admire immensely wrote a pretty positive review, positive enough to get me to take a real look. And I very much liked what I saw. Despite the flaws, they didn't mock sincere religious belief. They did not focus on ""What the church has to answer for"" and instead showed us how a sincere belief in God and an attitude of joyful humility and heartfelt gratitude can ameliorate life's problems. No, they don't go away. But yes, they can be borne.What a pleasant surprise. What an un-Hollywood point of view. And what a well done film. Especially delightful is Yorick van Wageningen, who was mighty good in Winter in Wartime, thriving in a very different role. We don't know what will happen in his life going forward, but we do know it will be different. His world does not reject religion, it does not even acknowledge it. And he is forced to think about some things he'd rather not.So, a well done look at what religion can mean, and what it can't. I just wish the film had ended 2 minutes earlier; the final scene was not only unnecessary but trite. Yep, travel for travel's sake is ultimately good, because, I suppose, as we learn about each other, we can resolve conflict.

With the slow evolution of each character, flawed, human, and all too human, we begin to feel the possibility of change in ourselves.  Estevez does not use the religious elements of the film too overtly or alienate potential viewers'.  Instead, he gives us an unflinching portrait of four annoying people who are offered the possibility of radical change, as we all are at some point in our lives, and he does so without missing a beat.Tom (Martin Sheen) is a cranky ophthalmologist who has a troubled relationship with his son, Daniel.  A student in anthropology, Daniel is determined not to stay in the confines of the University and to see the beauty and majesty of the world as other anthropologists have before him.  His father discourages him from doing so and worries about his safety.  Just a few days after dropping him at the airport, Tom's worst fears are realized.  His son strayed from the path of his journey, got caught in some rough weather, and died.  He was travelling the path of the El Camino de Santiago, a route of joy and penance for Catholics, tourists, and anyone looking for a beautiful and healthy trek from France to Spain.Tom, stricken with grief, travels to France to collect his son's body.  He has Daniel cremated and collects his ashes in a small box, and in a moment of what one can only call bitter inspiration, he decides to walk the Camino in spite of being 70 years old and not necessarily in the best of health.""The Way"", as this particular Camino is referred to, leads to the supposed burial site of the apostle St. James, whose ashes were buried underneath the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Santiago, Spain.  While there are traditional travelling routes to the Cathedral, most take their own and in the film, Tom and the people he encounters (a drugdealing, obese Dutchman, an angry Gen X Canadian named Sarah, and a pretentious Irish poet) are certainly taking the non traditional path.Tom is trying to make some sense of his son's senseless death while the other three try to catch up with him, physically and otherwise.  Some ugly things happen on the Way, some very human ugly things, but each pilgrim finds his/her own peace, at least for the moment.  No one emerges unscathed.

All I can say is that every time I look at it I find something else to notice and love and I've looked at it several times in just one week.  It's one of those LITTLE FILMS that just grab you from the very start.  I love Martin Sheen of course, always have.  In his older age he has certainly not lost his touch. His expression when he views his son's body is great acting.  Another scene when he opens the door of his hotel room to find the woman standing there is another priceless moment. The other 3 people are actors that I don't ever recall seeing before but all are wonderful.  They never seem to be acting, they seem to be real people in a real situation which, of course, is what excellent acting is all about. James Nesbitt is wonderful.  His facial expressions alone are enough to make you love the movie.  There are no huge dramatic moments but lots and lots of little dramatic moments in this film.  It seems to be a film about people who are hurt in some way and without making a big deal of their own story they sort of pretend that it's really just a small thing that has brought them on this journey.  The relationship between the people happens very gradually and is a very moving thing to watch. I have worked with doctors for over 40 years and I was particularly moved by the way he changes from the know it all, omnipotent DOCTOR person to a normal human being. I do want to mention that it is beautifully filmed with gorgeous scenery..  For a walking along the road film it never drags, the viewer is never bored.  I recommend it highly. In thinking over this film I'm moved to wonder how Emilio turned out so beautifully and Charlie turned out to be such a total piece of crap.  I wonder if Martin ever wonders about that. I understand that both boys were pretty much turned loose to do as they pleased at a very young age.  One turned his life around and the other one never did.  Emilio is beautiful in this movie.

1500521,A3OP9CU8GUWI03,B005S9ELCG,"J. Ridgway ""Ridge""","[8, 12]","The Way is a different kind of movie: thoughtful, personal and emotionally moving.  Martin Sheen plays a successful doctor who is estraneged from his adult, only son (Emilio Estevez).  His son is tragically killed in France in a hiking accident in the Pyrenees.  Sheen's character (Tom) must make the grim, lonely journey to France to identify the body and make arrangements.  This hits the viewer with a very emotional initial setting.  When Tom arrives, he learns that his son was killed while hiking the Camino de Santiago, a 500-mile trail that starts in France and ends up in Spain at the tomb of Saint James in Santiago de Compostela, at the sea.On a whim, Tom gets some gear and starts walking all by himself.  I, as the viewer, am thinking that it would be the perfect therapy to work out the terrible loss of one's child.  Tom brings his son's ashes in a special box and spreads little bits of them along the trail.  He mystically has visions of his son at various points along the journey.  Tom is a sad, lonely and grieving man when he starts out and Sheen gives a fine acting performance on this!  He bumps into different oddball characters along the way:  an obnoxious Dutchman who is walking to lose weight, a cynical, chain-smoking Canadian woman, and an Irish writer who has immense writer's block.  They, among the other pilgrims, are walking to cleanse themselves, to reflect, and to get inspiration from the deep Christian and spiritual history of the trail.  Tom shuns their companionship at first, but the long and adventurous journey has the effect of ironing out his emotional pain and helping him get back in touch with his fellow human travelers.  Tom has run-ins with a raging river, a band of gypsies, the Spanish police, and his fellow Euro travelers.  Along the journey, the little band of hikers grows to feel like a family.  One of the most moving scenes is when Tom starts opening up his heart to the Irish writer.  And there is always, in this movie, the ever-present feeling of the long, arduous road ahead of them.  When they reach the tomb at the church on the Spanish coast, it is a very moving and emotional culmination of their journey.  The scene in the final Catholic church where the priests are swinging the ""smoker pot"" back and forth is strangely moving, but even more so when Tom sees his son participating as one of the priests.  Tom reaches there a changed man, and he makes the final walk to the sea with his son's final remains.I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get in a reflective mood and travel with Tom.  I see in Tom and the other hikers, the desire to tap down into their own intuitive feelings of the 2000-year heritage of Western Christian civilization, the desire to cast off the distracting chaff of life and to narrow one's goal to just walking, pilgramiging, reflecting, praying, surviving and absorbing the surrounding countryside and culture.  I give it a ""4"" only because it may not be for everyone, and besides, ""5"" ratings should be rare.

But the film's four protagonists are seeking more mundane goals -- one wants to quit smoking, another to lose weight, a third to break his writer's block, while the fourth is acting on a spur-of-the-moment decision to take up the journey begun by his son, who died in attempting it.  At the end, two are not all that distressed to find themselves still smoking and overeating, the writer is happily scribbling away again, and we're not sure how things went for the father.  He is grumpy and uncommunicative throughout but finally accepting of the company and assistance of the other three.  The lesson overall seems to be that no one can make it through life without help from others.  I came away asking why this man is so negative in the first place.  Sadness over his son is understandable, but what he projects is more like a character trait not in keeping with what he has chosen to undertake.

This movie fails miserably at all of those.  What it succeeds at - is taking you on a beautiful journey, in a very simple, eloquent and touching fashion.I am very impressed with Emilio Estevez.  He managed to bring together a simple poignant story, the perfect cast, stunning visuals, beautiful music, and the one thing Hollywood seems to lack these days - the ability to make an emotional connection through a story.The entire cast delivers excellent, well-defined, yet subtle performances.  Martin Sheen, (and I could not picture anyone else in this role) in particular, captures the ""father of few words who can't express emotions"" in a very powerful fashion.  I read that Sheen had suggested Michael Douglas or Mel Gibson for the role of the father, and all I can say is, thank goodness Emilio told his father that it was written with him in mind.  Sheen is spot-on, and the father-son collaboration makes it all the more powerful.Each cast member is excellent, and very adept at pulling you into the story.  The final, fantastic cast member is The Camino itself.  Absolutely breathtaking, it is beautifully captured in the cinematography and editing.  The music as well, is tasteful, subtle and perfect for this film.  I enjoyed it so much I ended up downloading the soundtrack.This movie, very much like walking The Camino, should be savored.  The highest compliment that I can pay Emilio Estevez, is that after watching it 6 times on Netflix, I still felt the need to purchase the DVD.  It just speaks to me!  There are those who always wait for something dramatic to happen in a film, yet this movie contains such charm in the simple details.  Savor, pay attention to the subtleties, and it will touch your heart.

Daniel goes to retrieve the boy's body and decides to finish the 500-mile pilgrimage in honor of his son.  Along the way, he meets some other pilgrims who have their own reasons for doing the walk.There's a lot to like about this movie: The location photography is lovely, the walk is an attractive, challenging effort, and Martin Sheen does an outstanding job as the bereaved father.  Unfortunately, I didn't care about his three fellow travelers and that made the movie less satisfying for me.  His companions are a loud and obnoxious Dutch man, a bitter Canadian woman, and an arrogant Irish writer, none of whom I liked.  I thought their bond would grow into something heartwarming and memorable but it didn't, and I found them annoying and unnecessary.

1500539,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B005S9ELCG,K. Ostrowski,"[3, 8]","I had no real expectations going into this film.  I'd heard it was about a father who'd lost his son and went on a journey after that, but those vague descriptions were about all I knew about this movie.  I guess I was afraid it would turn out like ""the Father's Tale.""  It didn't, but I didn't really enjoy it all that much either.It's a story where a father loses his son in a freak accident while his son is on a pilgrimage, so the father takes his son's ashes on said pilgrimage, as a way to honor his wishes, I guess.  It's not an enormously-exciting concept, but I have to admit that it could have been done much worse.  However, it could also have been done much better.On his journey, the father; Tom, runs into a few other pilgrims.  One wants to quit smoking, one wants to lose weight, one is looking for an end to his writer's block... they eventually form a group of merry men, if you will, who continue on the road together, each with their own goals and aims, none of them particularly religious, yet all of them with the gall to go on a religious pilgrimage.Now, don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying you need to be a saint to go on a pilgrimage.  What I am saying is that when none of the main characters of your pilgrimage movie have any desire to better their souls in any way, you're asking for trouble.  The group of them complete the pilgrimage, and then just kind of go back to their own lives.  There's a lot of religious imagery in this film, but to me, that counts for precisely jack squat when the meaning and purpose of said imagery is so well-concealed.If you were very charitable towards this film, you might say that the characters seemed to have a sort of religious experience at the end, and their spiritual lives will probably improve from what they've seen and witnessed, but there's no real proof of that.  If you were really bitter with this movie, you could say that it's just trying to use tried-and-true religious imagery, symbols, names and locations to try to elevate secular humanism to a religious level that it doesn't deserve, but there's no proof of that either.In the end, though, there's no denying that a lot of religious terms and images were used, and nothing of any real consequence came of it.  That by itself is something of an insult to those of us who actually know what these things mean and cherish them for the truths that they assist us in acquiring and benefitting from.  Am I personally insulted by this movie?  Not really.  Films with no message are too bland to insult me, but they also don't impress me in any way.I guess you could say that there's one scene where a woman discusses her history with a child that she almost had, and her abortion, and how she dealt with the grief of the awful crime she committed, which could be a pretty awsome scene if it was handled well, but the discussion is over in a minute and a half, and it's never brought up again.  Even when it is brought up, there's no questioning the morality of what was done, just a couple people talking about how they feel.If you like this film, good for you.  If you don't like it, good for you too.  Me personally, I can't say I particularly belong to either camp, and I think I could sum up my experience with this film with the simple word ""meh.""Still, at least it manages itself better than certain books I've read recently.",3,I didn't like or dislike it.

The Way is about an uptight dentist (played by Martin Sheen) whose son dies while walking El Camino de Santiago (the way of Saint James). His son (played by Emilio Estavez) is an ex-graduate student who began the trip in order to find himself. Sheen decides to walk the Camino to honor his son, although he is told that one can only walk the Camino for one's self. Along the way he meets a group of interesting individuals and they form an unofficial group. For Sheen, what begins as a walk of tribute turns into a time of self discovery and healing. Sheen is deeply altered and in the end we are left to determine whether he walked for himself or his son. Trust me, the movie is better than it sounds. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Best of all, it is a movie for the entire family.Contrary to other reviews this is not a religious movie and there is no covert proselytizing, this movie is essentially about a group of people struggling with their own histories, lives, and personalities. Only one of the characters appears to be religious and he is a bit embarrassed to show it in front of his group.

1500548,A1N1W4OJESVHNL,B005S9ELCG,Lincoln S. Dall,"[55, 56]","While I was on a trip to Argentina and Chile with a group of teachers in the summer of 2002, Pam and Rick, a married couple from Maine also on the trip, mentioned to me several times that they thought I should look into going on the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, since they knew I was a very devoted Catholic, and since I was discerning my call to the priesthood.  At the time, I was a high school Spanish teacher living in Greenville, Mississippi, and a member of the Mississippi Teacher Corps from Ole Miss.  I ended up walking the Camino in the summer of 2003 with my friend Nancy, one year before I entered seminary.  I am now a priest in the Mississippi Delta - a long way from my upbringing in Chicago and southern California.  It is amazing where our journeys take us.  Being a pilgrim is all about the journey, about taking yourself out of the ordinary routine and putting yourself into God's hands. The pilgrims call out this encouragement to one another - ""Buen Camino"" - wishing each other a good road, a good journey.The characters in The Way were all called to the Camino de Santiago de Compostela for different reasons. Many of us don't even know why we are called.  And in the end, we never know how we are going to change.  What is a ""true pilgrim""?  That was a discussion Martin Sheen and the other pilgrims had one evening on their journey in Spain.  It is a question most pilgrims ask themselves along the journey, and some pilgrims can become a bit rigid or judgmental about it.  There probably is no good answer to that question. When you finish the Camino, you are asked for your motives for going.  Many of the characters in that movie struggled with that question as well.  Sometimes it is very difficult to put into words the way God is at work in our lives.I do know that being a pilgrim is a big part of my identity today. The Camino is a big part of my life.  I am planning to go back to Spain in April 2012.  We leave the day after Easter.  I am actually now a Catholic priest.  I was not a priest the first time I hiked to Santiago de Compostela.  This time around, I am going to start the walk in Pamplona with three of my friends from Mississippi.  One other person is meeting us in Leon about two weeks later to walk the last 200 miles with us.  We have been meeting on a monthly basis now for more than a year and a half, preparing as a group for this journey.This is a wonderful movie.  The one thing that was not touched upon in the movie in great detail was the physical challenge that confronts many pilgrimages.  My friend who walked the Camino with me in 2003 got a bad foot infection on the very first day and was not able to walk much of The Way.  I did not even have a blister, but my next Camino might be very different.  This is a very inspiring, very spiritual movie.  I applaud Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez for their efforts.  Their spirituality really shines in this movie.  It is not an earth-shattering movie with big special affects and it is not a sequel in a big movie franchise.  In many ways, this movie is different than most.  We need more movies like this.Update - June 2012I did walk the Camino in April/May 2012.  It is amazing how much more popular it is now since the time I walked it in 2012.  At the pilgrims' hostel in Leon, one of the Benedictine nuns talked to us about what it means to be a pilgrim.  It is not primarily about being a fast walker or trying to rack up the most mileage each day or getting to the destination first.  Being a pilgrim is to take everything in - the relationships you make on the Camino, the sights, the sounds, the journey - and processing it in your soul and finding out how it all relates to you spiritually.  I met a man from Germany who told me that he was searching for something.  He didn't know what questions to ask.  He did not know what answers he was looking for.  But he was on a quest, and that brought him to the Camino.  I also met three men from New York on the Camino.  Even though they were in their mid-30s, it was like they were plucked from a frat house at a university.  Yet, they had decided to go on the Camino after one of them had seen this movie - The Way.  It is amazing to see the many people draw to this ancient pilgrimage from the Catholic Church as they search for answers and meaning in life.  There will be many more American pilgrims going to Santiago de Compostela in the coming years, and this movie will be part of the reason why.",5,Buen Camino!,1321488000,"11 17, 2011",2011,4478,"['was', 'trip', 'Argentina', 'Chile', 'group', 'teachers', 'summer', '2002', 'Pam', 'Rick', 'married', 'couple', 'Maine', 'also', 'trip', 'mentioned', 'several', 'times', 'thought', 'should', 'look', 'going', 'pilgrimage', 'Santiago', 'de', 'Compostela', 'knew', 'was', 'very', 'devoted', 'Catholic', 'was', 'discerning', 'call', 'priesthood', 'time', 'was', 'high', 'school', 'Spanish', 'teacher', 'living', 'Greenville', 'Mississippi', 'member', 'Mississippi', 'Teacher', 'Corps', 'Ole', 'Miss', 'ended', 'up', 'walking', 'Camino', 'summer', '2003', 'friend', 'Nancy', 'one', 'year', 'entered', 'seminary', 'am', 'now', 'priest', 'Mississippi', 'Delta', 'long', 'way', 'upbringing', 'Chicago', 'southern', 'California', 'amazing', 'where', 'journeys', 'take', 'Being', 'pilgrim', 'journey', 'taking', 'ordinary', 'routine', 'putting', 'God', 'hands', 'pilgrims', 'call', 'out', 'encouragement', 'one', 'Buen', 'Camino', 'wishing', 'other', 'good', 'road', 'good', 'journey.The', 'characters', 'Way', 'were', 'called', 'Camino', 'de', 'Santiago', 'de', 'Compostela', 'different', 'reasons', 'Many', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'why', 'are', 'called', 'end', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'are', 'going', 'change', 'What', 'true', 'pilgrim', 'was', 'discussion', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'other', 'pilgrims', 'had', 'one', 'evening', 'journey', 'Spain', 'question', 'most', 'pilgrims', 'ask', 'journey', 'pilgrims', 'can', 'become', 'bit', 'rigid', 'judgmental', 'probably', 'good', 'answer', 'question', 'When', 'finish', 'Camino', 'are', 'asked', 'motives', 'going', 'Many', 'characters', 'movie', 'struggled', 'question', 'as', 'well', 'Sometimes', 'very', 'difficult', 'put', 'words', 'way', 'God', 'work', 'lives.I', 'do', 'know', 'being', 'pilgrim', 'big', 'part', 'identity', 'today', 'Camino', 'big', 'part', 'life', 'am', 'planning', 'go', 'back', 'Spain', 'April', '2012', 'leave', 'day', 'Easter', 'am', 'actually', 'now', 'Catholic', 'priest', 'was', 'not', 'priest', 'first', 'time', 'hiked', 'Santiago', 'de', 'Compostela', 'time', 'am', 'going', 'start', 'walk', 'Pamplona', 'three', 'friends', 'Mississippi', 'One', 'other', 'person', 'meeting', 'Leon', 'two', 'weeks', 'later', 'walk', 'last', '200', 'miles', 'have', 'been', 'meeting', 'monthly', 'basis', 'now', 'more', 'year', 'half', 'preparing', 'group', 'journey.This', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'not', 'touched', 'movie', 'great', 'detail', 'was', 'physical', 'challenge', 'many', 'pilgrimages', 'friend', 'who', 'walked', 'Camino', '2003', 'got', 'bad', 'foot', 'infection', 'very', 'first', 'day', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'walk', 'much', 'Way', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'blister', 'next', 'Camino', 'might', 'be', 'very', 'different', 'very', 'inspiring', 'very', 'spiritual', 'movie', 'applaud', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'efforts', 'spirituality', 'really', 'movie', 'not', 'earth-shattering', 'movie', 'big', 'special', 'affects', 'not', 'sequel', 'big', 'movie', 'franchise', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'different', 'most', 'need', 'more', 'movies', 'this.Update', 'June', '2012I', 'did', 'walk', 'Camino', 'April/May', '2012', 'amazing', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'popular', 'now', 'time', 'walked', '2012', 'pilgrims', 'hostel', 'Leon', 'one', 'Benedictine', 'nuns', 'talked', 'what', 'be', 'pilgrim', 'not', 'primarily', 'being', 'fast', 'walker', 'trying', 'rack', 'up', 'most', 'mileage', 'day', 'getting', 'destination', 'first', 'Being', 'pilgrim', 'take', 'everything', 'relationships', 'make', 'Camino', 'sights', 'sounds', 'journey', 'processing', 'soul', 'finding', 'out', 'how', 'spiritually', 'met', 'man', 'Germany', 'who', 'told', 'was', 'searching', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'questions', 'ask', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'was', 'quest', 'brought', 'Camino', 'also', 'met', 'three', 'men', 'New', 'York', 'Camino', 'Even', 'were', 'mid-30s', 'was', 'were', 'plucked', 'frat', 'house', 'university', 'had', 'decided', 'go', 'Camino', 'one', 'had', 'seen', 'movie', 'Way', 'amazing', 'see', 'many', 'people', 'draw', 'ancient', 'pilgrimage', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'search', 'answers', 'meaning', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'many', 'more', 'American', 'pilgrims', 'going', 'Santiago', 'de', 'Compostela', 'coming', 'years', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'part', 'reason', 'why']",N/A

Not many thought much of his initial efforts in the big chair - but I still count 'Men at Work' among my favorites. So, understandably, it was shocking to screen this project some twenty-two years down the road. Showcasing an incredible maturation that, quite frankly, is startling when you compare the two films side-by-side.Yes, it's predictable and clich&eacute;d. But like so many productions which deal with death and one's self-examination of life, symbolic of the film as well, the path to the same place can be so incredibly varied. A view that one repeatedly sees doesn't necessarily have the same value or meaning when seen through another's eyes. Example: A local resident sees Diamond Head. It's beautiful, but at the same time, it's just there. When a visitor sees it, it's a fantasy fulfilled and a picture postcard come to life. But when a returning combat solider sees it, it's Home - the safe loving embrace of family and friends.The exact same situation yielding completely different perspectives, depending greatly on the journey one takes to get there. So too this tale.It is, no pun intended, a well-worn retread. But Martin Sheen gives us so much more than a run-through performance. His heartfelt sincerity is evident as his character, Tom, undertakes a journey that exposes his vulnerability to the immense grief of losing his only child. The human element he hides and sublimates, battling to internalize a private suffering, when what he needs more than anything else is to release it - to reach out for help. Even if all that help amounts to is the comfort given by fellow petitioners and the odd traveler...or three. Sufferers all to one degree or another.Ultimately, The Way is a gift from his late son - a ""truly meaningful life"". The same life Daniel wanted so desperately for himself, but couldn't express or explain to his emotionally sedentary father.The flip side: There's an extraordinary unrealistic aspect to this film's premise, a preachy arrogance born out of wealth that I truly don't appreciate. Most people can't just up and leave their responsibilities to increase one's life quotient. It reveals the vast disconnect listening to people of means 'explain life' to the rest of us. Especially when the well-off see themselves as lost, when what they truly are is bored. Truth: You don't get bored when you're struggling every single day with two jobs, putting food on the table, keeping the lights on and preventing your children from homelessness. Taking off to travel and discover a ""meaningful life"" isn't an option when you're grinding to survive. Just sayin'. &lt;hands raised in defense>Additionally, some of the characters felt quite staged - amusing, but equally, much too clever. The Chaucerian writer on-the-road was a stretch; the mad innkeeper, however insanely hilarious, felt contrived and overdone; the honorable gypsies decidedly unbelievable with telltale signs of romanticizing.But those are minor knocks in an overall solid production.Honestly, if no one had said this was directed by Emilio - and then bet me to guess the filmmaker behind the lens - I would've gone bankrupt. No way could I have foreseen what a talent he had become over the years. If the established film community doesn't see it, then cinephiles are screwed. There will be no hope in finding alternatives to Michael Bay's outlandish creations or James Cameron's more recent infantile products.If you've ever lost someone you truly loved and miss with all your heart, you know that pain is so very personal. 'The Way' is a deeply emotional film that will touch you in ways that many cannot see or understand because you're on your own path and on your own journey.Movie Notes:- I was very surprised to see Joaquim de Almeida ever so briefly in one scene, fully expecting him to play a larger role in the film. To then not see him began a mental itch. Editorial cut? Or something more finessed? Interesting.- And another interesting cameo, veteran character actor Matt Clark. Suspect a personal connection to the filmmakers that I'd love to hear more about.- Given the theme, I wonder if the character of Tom was inspired, in part, by Saint Thomas? He of the doubt and redeemed faith. One wonders.Personal Notes:- El Ramon The Innkeeper is a small half-step from Norman Bates and his 'mother'.

You make a living by helping others to see more clearly.  How about looking at yourself, inward.  Why are you so angry with me?  Where is this anger coming from?  Nothing I do seems to please you.  What have I done to you?  I'm hurt and confused.  You're a smart man.  Can you please help me understand?""  The son decides to go on a pilgrimage to find some answers, but shortly after beginning it, he, I suspect, hears that voice inside, ""Who do you think you are?  You're not good enough.""  To escape from the intensity of the voice, he goes off the trail risking his life.  Aside from the fact that he is an only child, why is this voice so powerful?  One possibility for consideration comes from psychology, ""Those of the older generation, for their part, are likewise motivated by their unconscious wishes, which stem from their own childhood, instinctual wishes.  For example, ... a member of the older generation may unconsciously equate the younger generation (his 'children') with his own parents, who are now in reality aged or deceased, but who, in his unconscious fantasy, are reincarnated in the new generation."" (pg 224 from An Elementary Textbook of Psychoanalysis by Charles Brenner)  In other words, in some cases, to put it bluntly, the son becomes the mother to the father and try as the father might, he cannot resolve his issues with his mother by scapegoating his son.  The other three travelers seem to have unresolved father issues as well, but metaphorically speaking, seem to represent Tom's developing sides (emotional, openness etc).  The movie brought up the issue of whether or not technology is of help or hindrance to being a seeker.  Perhaps asking why bringing an ipod is part of the process?

The plot is very simple; a grieving father decides to complete his dead son's journey along the Way of St. James to northwest Spain. The reviewer(s) who mentioned the Canterbury Tales are right in the simularities. It is earnest, predictable, and deliberately paced and reminded me of the old Christopher Hour on Sunday morning television of so many years ago. The photography and scenery are really outstanding and almost reason enough to watch. Martin Sheen overacted a bit for my taste but the cast of lesser known performers is first rate and the message might have been lost with big names in the other roles. The film interspirses dialogue and travel (ie., walking the trail) scenes to move the story along. When the characters are not interacting, the scenery captures the viewers attention. Most surprisingly to this cynic, it kept my interest the whole way through. It's not  worth paying $15 to see at a theater but definitly worth watching.

Then there has been all of the tabloid gossip about his other son and namesake, Charlie Sheen.  I had to wonder how Martin's feelings about his two sons informed his performance here.  Of course we'll never know that, nor should we.The story is relatively simple:  four people from different countries meet up on the famous pilgim's trail and fall in with each other.  It's a modern Canterbuy Tale.  As someone said, no one travels the trail by accident and one gets the feeling that these four were destined to meet each other, too.  Their interactions are just part of the miracles that each one is looking for, whether or not they can name them.The acting is very good. The scenery is wonderful.  The story is good.  The characters are believable; each one has problems and weaknesses and each one has something of value to offer the others.  Just like life.

It's the story of a man whose son dies while making a pilgrimage. The father impulsively decides to complete the trek, along an ancient well-traveled road through Spain.  I wanted to see this movie, because the plot has potential and Martin Sheen is an excellent actor.  There are a couple of flaws with this film which keep it from coming any where close to its potential.  (1) Very thin, almost nonexistent backstory.  Without developing the preceding father-son conflict beyond a bare-bones sketch, it's hard to dredge up empathy for the father's journey.  Of course we are sympathetic that he lost his son, but there needs to be more of a connection in order for the audience to ""Care"" about his journey.  (2) The various characters the father meets along the way seem to have some sort of bond but it doesnt go any where...in other words, how are they transformed by their journey and by each other?  If that answer is in the movie, in any but the most superficial sense, i missed it.  (3) How is the father--after all 99 % of the movie features  him--transformed?  We see a brief glimpse of him wandering around in some ""foreign"" looking market, but what does that mean?  And is it a transformation or just an imitation of the life he thinks his son would have lived? Did the journey heal his grief?  Hard to say. You won't find any clues in the movie.  On the plus side, the scenery is nice.  And there is a cool meeting & party with a gypsy family, which actually seemed to have some promise as a turning point, but then that petered out too.  I'm sorry to say I think Emilio needed a script doctor to turn this vanity film into an actual story.

1500635,A2GS6XMWDUA4KG,B005S9ELCG,T. Briggs,"[0, 0]","The WayMeet Tom, 60-something, an eye doctor with a successful practice.  We learn his son Dan, 40-ish, has dropped out of his PhD program after his mom passed away.  Tom can&#8217;t understand his son&#8217;s choices and while driving him to the airport is invited by his son to take the journey with him.  He tells his dad that Margaret Meade didn&#8217;t become famous by studying but by getting out in the world and that his Dad should travel more.  Dan wants to travel.  Apparently his mother&#8217;s early death taught him something about life that his father had yet to learn.  Tom confronts him for the last time about finding &#8220;something&#8221; and sticking to it.  Dan replies, &#8220;you chose your life, you&#8217;re a doctor, and that&#8217;s fine, but some people choose their life and other people live their life.&#8221;  Yes I could hear Auntie Mame in the background of my mind extorting us on the banquet of life to &#8220;live, live, live!&#8221;He wishes his son well and goes on about his doctor life, apparently on the golf course engaging in witty successful guy golf repartee with his doctor buddies when his mobile rings.His son has been killed on the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage by a freak storm.  And in the next scene we see him identifying his son&#8217;s body.  After collecting his son&#8217;s things, all the equipment you need to make the 2 month walk through the mountains, he returns to the Gendarmerie, and tells them to cremate his son.  He then sets off with Dan&#8217;s walking stick, backpack, sleeping bag and ashes and heads onto the trail.Along the way he meets a variety of characters and the question &#8220;why are you walking the way?&#8221; reveals deeper truths about each of the characters upon which our hero can reflect.  There&#8217;s Joost, the overweight Dutchman, with the special cigarettes and anything you need to sleep from Ambien to ear plugs.  There&#8217;s Sarah, the blonde smartass beauty, who is pretending she&#8217;s walking in order to give up her cigarette habit at the end and which she indulges at every opportunity.The Way is supposed to be cathartic and a source of healing and miracles.  She&#8217;s hoping to exorcise her demons.  There&#8217;s Jack from Ireland, the blocked writer hoping to find a story.  And others come in and out of their journey adding spice to the mix.  Along the way he is distributing his son&#8217;s ashes until the encounter with gypsies, a true plot point, in which he&#8217;s advised to save the ashes and at the end of the journey he&#8217;ll know what to do.At the end our four travelers are standing at the desk getting their Compostella passbooks stamped for the last time and receiving their certifications that they finished their journeys.  And each of them are asked their name, if they walked the whole way and did each stop as directed and finally why they made their journey.  Jack from Ireland says he was searching for leprechauns at the end of the way.  Our chain smoking blonde says religion and our overweight Dutchman says he wanted to lose weight because his wife wouldn&#8217;t sleep with him anymore.  Tom gives his name but has a hard time answering the why.It is not a spoiler to reveal that Tom answers he thought he should travel more and upon seeing his certificate advises the attendant that he&#8217;s given him the wrong name and asks if he can change it to Dan.  That his father completed the journey with him even in death provides healing and understanding to our hero.This movie is not about the end of course, it&#8217;s about the journey and its lesson is that life too is about the journey and not about what you become but who you are and not how you die but what you do with the days you have until you die.  And for the millions of us lapsed Catholics it rips a special hole in our hearts and offers the promise that we not hold our disappointment with our church and our hatred for those who erect and maintain those Temples of Tears around the world but the simple message that Jesus wants us to be there for one another and that if we love each other we will find our salvation.Perhaps it&#8217;s time to forgive the Church that has betrayed humanity and rediscover the true meaning of Jesus&#8217; love.  Now don&#8217;t think for one moment this movie is preachy, religious or about Jesus and miracles.  It is not.  As Sarah says while lighting up yet another cigarette - &#8220;This was never about quitting these things.  But you knew that.&#8221;  Yes.  I get it now.If finding your inner Jesus is one possible outcome so much the beter.  For each of us this movie will be something special &#8211; this film was an act of love.  And it&#8217;s love that&#8217;s the underlying theme and the thread that ties all the parts together.  This film moved me in unexpected ways.  It found a chink in my jaded armor and wiggled its way in.  Few films are able to do that without feeling contrived.  Bravo.

C.,"[2, 2]","I've always liked Martin Sheen; he's a great actor, great screen presence and he has the indefinable something like Humphrey Bogart and John Garfield and James Cagney which makes him a star and someone that people want to watch; he could be filmed reading out his shopping list and people would still want to watch!I anticipated this film even before I watched it, and enjoyed every moment; it's poignant, sad, introspective and very funny in parts too. A good film or anything that is created from nothing should at the least make you think, and at best make you wonder; the best pieces of art should at least make you think. It doesn't necessarily mean that that which is artistic shouldn't make someone a lot of money either, as I think the creative process can go hand in hand with the making of money, just that we hope that something can be lasting, like a great film noir from the 40's or 50's or a Hendrix tune or a painting from Vincent Van Gogh.So, the film; it is about a man who finds that his son has died on the El camino de Santiago, the way of Saint James, and of course he is shocked and grief-stricken, goes to Spain to sort things out, and then embarks on the trail himself. Along the way, he meets other people, just as individualistic and quirky as he is; an Irish travel writer, a slightly fat Dutchman and a slightly hard-bitten Canadian woman. They walk most the way and share laughs and adventures and secrets on the way. I'm not big on metaphors or symbolism, but I think that the El camino de Santiago represents all our paths we take in life, a path that leads us who knows where, where we experience joy, pain, laughs, tears and hopefully a sense of fulfilment and redemption when we reach our goal; life isn't just a destination it is definitely a journey too. We all know that the end of the journey is death, our own mortality, so perhaps we should learn to enjoy the journey a little more and stop worrying.I've got friends in Spain, one particular friend, well, truth to tell she is Catalonian and never tell someone from Catalonia they are Spanish! Anyway, Spain is beautifully shown off in all its splendour and it is a beautiful country all told; I've visited Barcelona and it's my favourite city with good restaurants and nice people and a good not over-hot climate being northern Spain.I recommend this film highly as not your typical Hollywood blockbuster but one that you will like and makes you think and one which you will want to view again. And the big question? YES, I definitely want one day, when I make my fortune, to walk the whole El camino de Santiago; perhaps on my own or with a friend or two.

Daniel was caught in the storm while walking the Camino de Santiago, or the Way of St. James, a pilgrimage road in northwestern Spain. In order to retrieve his son's body, Thomas flies to France, where, instead of going back to America, decides to go on a pilgrimage himself, with his dead son's ashes in a box.The simple story may remind us of David Lynch's ""The Straight Story."" The difference is that Thomas travels with three strangers: fun-loving Joost (Yorick van Wageningen), cynical and chain-dsmoking Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger) and Jack (James Nesbitt), an Irish travel writer having ""writer's block."" Tch&eacute;ky Karyo also appears as a kind French police captain.What makes the film special is the strong performance of Martin Sheen, and the beautiful sceneries of the pilgrimage road. Supporting characters tend to be one-dimensional (the stereotypical portrait of a Dutchman Joost, for instance), and Estevez's episodic screenplay (based on a Jack Hitt book) needs some trimming (Estevez's character should be seen less frequently), but Martin Sheen's acting almost makes up for the lack of the depth of the script. The story is predictable and the journey is slow, but it is still worth taking.If you are interested in the pilgrimage road, you may want to see a French film ""Saint Jacques...

Following a path that has been traveled for a thousand years, four pilgrims hike along the Pyrenees Mountains and Basque country on an 800 km trek to the tomb of Saint James in the town of Santiago de Compostela.The movie is about finding meaning in life, even after the worst tragedies (Martin Sheen's son has died while on the pilgrimage and Martin completes it, leaving bits of his son's ashes along the way). The fact that the characters are all Catholics is really not that important. The same story could have been told about Hindus making a pilgrimage.This is a beautiful movie filled with likable characters, and it will have you hoping that they will all succeed in their quest of self-discovery and reconciling themselves to the realities of their lives.For me, at least, the ancient architecture was a reminder of what western European civilization owes Spain. In 1492, the same year that Columbus discovered the New World, Queen Isabella expelled the Moors from Spain, leaving Europe in the hands of the Christians, rather than the Muslims. Of course, it was brutal and bloody (they also expelled the Jews). But--and this is important--many Muslims and Jews simply converted to Christianity so they could stay.

As a loyal Amazonian, I looked up the reviews first. When there are a hundred or so, I usually read the one-stars first, because often I learn more quickly that way whether the film is one I might enjoy. So I read the one and two stars posted here, then a few three and four stars, and a couple of five stars. Most of the posters who did not like the movie thought it was overlong, boring and had unlikeable characters. While I agree that the film has a few flaws, they were certainly not fatal, and in fact, quite minor. Both my wife and I stayed connected to the characters all the way through, and felt it was just long enough. It had a few really nice laughs, and few moments that could easily produce tears, and many smile moments, and a few ""ouch"" scenes because the travelers were humans who were stressed and damaged and failed opportunities for kindness and understanding. But overall, we liked Martin Sheen and the handful of misfits who walked 500 miles with him through rural Spain. The film does not distain or promote Roman Catholicism. Rather it depicts some of its beauty and historical importance. It does not graft ""New Age"" spiritual ideas onto the way of St. James, except for how ordinary people often merge ""modern"" religious sensibility with a reluctant but persistent attraction to the awe and mystery of ancient faiths. Above all, it is the story of how a long walk with strangers might slowly heal the hurts of humans: grief, abuse, estrangement, loneliness, dissatisfaction with one's work or one's body, etc. There is more talk than action, but that's true of most films I like.

1500657,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B005S9ELCG,William Timothy Lukeman,"[0, 0]","There are some films that aren't masterpieces, but still strike a deeply resonant chord with viewers. For me, ""The Way"" is just such a film. Small, sincere, honest, it doesn't strive for some magnificent epiphany or all-knowing message. Instead, it offers a protagonist not unlike many of us, set in his ways, comfortable enough in them, who must suddenly face the shattering of his life & begin trying to cope with it.In this case, Martin Sheen delivers a quietly powerful performance as Tom Avery, who must cope with the death of his estranged son Daniel, who was beginning the long pilgrimage on the Camino de Santiago. Unable to put into words the depth & complexity of his anguished emotions, he chooses to complete the pilgrimage for his son ... and of course for himself. So he sets out, determined to reach his destination as swiftly as possible & find some sort of closure.""Closure"" -- that's an overused word these days, almost a glib & arbitrary cutoff point imposed by a society intent on ""moving forward"" at all costs. In a way, it's a means of avoiding any in-depth contemplation & exploration. That's what makes this film so honest & heartfelt: it's not about closure, it's about opening up. In fact, Tom Avery's problem is that his whole life has become closed, sealed off; he's so goal-oriented that he can't see the beauty & wonder of the journey itself.But as he continues on the pilgrimage & unwillingly finds himself gaining three very different companions, Tom does begin to open up. As I said, there's no single shattering epiphany; it's more of an organic growth, a slow realization that there is indeed far more to life than simply getting there. If it's not explicitly a religious theme, it's definitely a spiritual one. I was reminded of Thomas Merton's classic volume ""Mystics and Zen Masters"" while watching, in that the film is much more about direct & immediate experience than any particular dogma or program. As Teresa of Avila once wrote, ""Every day on the road to God is God."" And this is just as true for an atheist like myself as it is for a religious believer -- the journey is what matters, and the goal is simply a marker.I don't want to make this sound too ponderous & weighty. While there's plenty of substance here, writer-director Emilio Estevez never confuses what's genuinely meaningful with the glumly portentous or heavy-handed piety. There's a lot of humor, joie de vivre, and sheer beauty here, both in the gorgeous landscapes & in the evolving friendship of the four travelers. Everything is a reminder that each moment of life is both fleeting & precious, not to be wasted. For those of us who find our lives being eaten away by the minutia of the everyday, which we've come to take for granted as reality, this is something we desperately need to remember!And is anyone changed by the end of the film? Perhaps not so much changed as more truly themselves, far more knowledgeable & accepting of who they are, flaws & all. The final scene makes it clear that the journey never really ends, not for those who have broken through the walls of the mundane world that we've been taught is so important. Opening up, not closure -- most highly recommended!",5,A journey well worth taking many times,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,3201,"['are', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'masterpieces', 'still', 'strike', 'deeply', 'resonant', 'chord', 'viewers', 'Way', 'just', 'such', 'film', 'Small', 'sincere', 'honest', ""n't"", 'strive', 'magnificent', 'epiphany', 'all-knowing', 'message', 'Instead', 'protagonist', 'not', 'many', 'set', 'ways', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'who', 'must', 'suddenly', 'face', 'shattering', 'life', 'begin', 'trying', 'cope', 'it.In', 'case', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'quietly', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Avery', 'who', 'must', 'cope', 'death', 'estranged', 'son', 'Daniel', 'who', 'was', 'beginning', 'long', 'pilgrimage', 'Camino', 'de', 'Santiago', 'Unable', 'put', 'words', 'depth', 'complexity', 'anguished', 'emotions', 'complete', 'pilgrimage', 'son', 'course', 'So', 'out', 'determined', 'reach', 'destination', 'as', 'swiftly', 'possible', 'find', 'sort', 'closure', 'Closure', 'overused', 'word', 'days', 'almost', 'glib', 'arbitrary', 'cutoff', 'point', 'imposed', 'society', 'intent', 'moving', 'forward', 'costs', 'way', 'means', 'avoiding', 'in-depth', 'contemplation', 'exploration', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'honest', 'heartfelt', 'not', 'closure', 'opening', 'up', 'fact', 'Tom', 'Avery', 'problem', 'whole', 'life', 'become', 'closed', 'sealed', 'off', 'so', 'goal-oriented', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'beauty', 'wonder', 'journey', 'itself.But', 'pilgrimage', 'unwillingly', 'gaining', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'companions', 'Tom', 'begin', 'open', 'up', 'said', 'single', 'shattering', 'epiphany', 'more', 'organic', 'growth', 'slow', 'realization', 'indeed', 'far', 'more', 'life', 'simply', 'getting', 'there', 'not', 'explicitly', 'religious', 'theme', 'definitely', 'spiritual', 'one', 'was', 'reminded', 'Thomas', 'Merton', 'classic', 'volume', 'Mystics', 'Zen', 'Masters', 'watching', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'direct', 'immediate', 'experience', 'particular', 'dogma', 'program', 'Teresa', 'Avila', 'once', 'wrote', 'day', 'road', 'God', 'God', 'just', 'true', 'atheist', 'like', 'religious', 'believer', 'journey', 'what', 'matters', 'goal', 'simply', 'marker.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'make', 'sound', 'too', 'ponderous', 'weighty', 'plenty', 'substance', 'here', 'writer-director', 'Emilio', 'Estevez', 'never', 'what', 'genuinely', 'meaningful', 'glumly', 'portentous', 'heavy-handed', 'piety', 'lot', 'humor', 'joie', 'de', 'vivre', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'here', 'gorgeous', 'landscapes', 'evolving', 'friendship', 'four', 'travelers', 'Everything', 'reminder', 'moment', 'life', 'fleeting', 'precious', 'not', 'be', 'wasted', 'who', 'find', 'lives', 'being', 'eaten', 'away', 'minutia', 'everyday', ""'ve"", 'come', 'take', 'granted', 'reality', 'something', 'desperately', 'need', 'remember', 'anyone', 'changed', 'end', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'changed', 'more', 'truly', 'far', 'more', 'knowledgeable', 'accepting', 'who', 'are', 'flaws', 'final', 'scene', 'clear', 'journey', 'never', 'really', 'not', 'who', 'have', 'broken', 'walls', 'mundane', 'world', ""'ve"", 'been', 'taught', 'so', 'important', 'Opening', 'up', 'not', 'closure', 'most', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

It eases into its depth with humor and style and while it's premise borders on the religious pilgrimage to the shrine at Santiago, Spain, it's actually more of a buddy movie with a quartet of unlikely travellers who use the pilgimage as an excuse to deal with various degrees of loss; of loved ones, of self, faith, or just a writer's fickle muse.It's well worth a look, even when it's not a slow night, and maybe when you want something more satisfying from Hollywood.",4,"Walking the walk, weighing the way",1336262400,"05 6, 2012",2012,951,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'was', 'little', 'reluctant', 'watch', 'movie', 'premise', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'slow', 'sappy', 'figured', ""'d"", 'watch', 'family', 'slow', 'night', 'surprise', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'nice', 'little', 'travel', 'film', 'oh', 'dunno', 'had', 'decent', 'plot', 'too', 'are', 'car', 'chases', 'firy', 'explosions', 'ridiculolus', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'directing', 'zen-like', 'exploration', 'who', 'are', 'who', 'think', 'are', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'why', 'depth', 'humor', 'style', 'premise', 'borders', 'religious', 'pilgrimage', 'shrine', 'Santiago', 'Spain', 'actually', 'more', 'buddy', 'movie', 'quartet', 'unlikely', 'travellers', 'who', 'use', 'pilgimage', 'excuse', 'deal', 'various', 'degrees', 'loss', 'loved', 'ones', 'self', 'faith', 'just', 'writer', 'fickle', 'muse.It', 'well', 'look', 'even', 'when', 'not', 'slow', 'night', 'maybe', 'when', 'want', 'something', 'more', 'satisfying', 'Hollywood']",N/A

Rodick,"[6, 6]","I watched my own dvd of every photograph which has me in it entitled 'My Life in Pictures 1962 - 2004' before viewing The Way this evening and then settling down to write this appraisal. After viewing my dvd I was struck by how many people I used to be. Not just the faces of me, that I now identify, but the lives I have been. The people who shared. The communities we have been.As I watched Martin Sheen's journey I was reminded of the journeys I've taken, the smiles I've captured and the warmth which caused me to grow. And the anxieties we leave behind. In the next few weeks I must write a four thousand word essay about 'gated communities' for a degree. There is a writer on Sheen's trek, I little too florid for me but his heart is in the right place, his Irishness has one scene inspired by 'Waiting for Godot.' That's the thing with travelling; it opens the soul to the immediate and now, removing the habits of time and the lie of comforts. Free.The conceits and the facades are gradually dissipated by the characters who embark upon The Way. Welcomed by strangers each with their own hidden lives, only the impermanence of passing faces brings out our better sides. And, of course, the joy of all that sunshine upon an uncluttered landscape easily frees the mind of shames.Don't be surprised by all the music. It does travel with you and not always requiring batteries. This is a film about travelling. It may seem to be something of a whim for Tom (Sheen's character) but I understood his reasoning. He had the will, if not the gloves. It is life enhancing, to the point where you can never really be alone again. Some call it by a religion's name. I feel it in each step we take.What I can not understand is why people build walls around themselves and call it community. The trough gets deeper. Rigid faces are lonely places.
