""B5"" is a novel made for television over five seasons, with characters that really evolve and change and stories that don't return to the ""ground state"" at the end of the hour. It broke new ground in many areas, while tipping its hat to film, TV, and print sci-fi in others.Watching B5 is amazing in a lot of ways. For example, little bits, even stray remarks, from one episode will affect the outcome of something else in another episode. There are role reversals and there are different perceptions of the same event in different episodes.Plus a nifty musical score, the first all-CGI special effects, adequate acting, and a big intricate plot.And you can own it. In one box.The DVD set is beautifully produced. The episodes are in wide-screen and beautifully sharp. The Dolby surround sound is crystal clear. The ""extras"" in each season are nice.There is a small nit, which is that you don't get the pilot episode (The Gathering) and you'll want that. Owning B5 frees us at last from the vagaries of repeats on the Sci-Fi channel (when there are any) or decaying video tape.If you know B5, you'll want to own this collection. Note: there are plenty of bad Chinese knockoffs on the 'net.

810372,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B0001M3MXY,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[12, 57]","I am the sort of science fiction viewer who liked the original Star Trek, but recognized that plenty of its episodes were dumb, dull, or pointless filler.  I disliked The Next Generation era, which aside from several stellar episodes (like ""The Inner Light"", ""Tapestry"", ""Best of Both Worlds"", etcetera) was largely more of the same, with a heaping dose of insufferable smugness for the first two seasons.  I believe Deep Space Nine was the best overall Star Trek series, and that Voyager was atrocious on virtually every level, and that while the first two seasons of Enterprise matched Voyager's worst moments, the last two seasons were phenomenal, given the caliber that had just preceded it in the first two seasons.I am also the sort of science fiction viewer who has fallen in love with Battlestar Galactica, the reimagined series.I initially had no interest in Babylon 5, but I've heard things about it.  Great things.  I've heard compliments about the writing, the storyarcs, and the fact that it was largely all pre-written before even the TV pilot began.In my review for the TV movie pilot, I said that it was a failure on virtually every level; the dialogue was stale and cliche, the writing plodding and incoherent, the characterization virtually nonexistant, the CGI atrocious even for the early 90s, and the acting as bad as a 50s B Sci-Fi movie.Unfortunately as I am half-way through season 4 (with there being 5 seasons), very little has improved.  The acting varies, with people like Peter Jurasik (Londo Mollari) and Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar) putting on stellar and dependable performances all the time.The others, though, simply get worse with age.  Susan Ivanova is insufferably horrible, trashy cliche lines matched with middle-school level projection and acting.  Mira Furlan gets a lot better from the TV Pilot, but she's still a one-note, one-dimensional mopey softheart.  Sheridan, Doctor Franklin, Marcus Cole, Michael Garibaldi, virtually all the human characters are one-dimensional, less characters than archetypes.In fact, I'm reminded of Ronald D. Moore's ""manifesto"" written that was published with the scripts of the Battlestar Galactica miniseries:""We take as a given the idea that the traditional space opera, with its stock characters, techno-double-talk, bumpy-headed aliens, thespian histrionics, and empty heroics has run its course and a new approach is required.""This was written far after Babylon 5 ended, but every time I notice that the aliens are well-rounded, fleshed out characters and the humans remain one-note archetypes, I'm reminded of something relating to the above mentioned in a documentary or a commentary for Battlestar Galactica---something about how it was commonplace in science fiction for the aliens to essentially steal the show, becoming the well-rounded, beloved breakout characters, and the humans being the stale, boring, yet necessary straight characters.That is exactly how Babylon 5 is.  The aliens in the form of Londo Mollari, G'Kar, Vir Cotto, even dorkhead Lennier, constitute the greatest and most fun parts of the series, and the humans constitute the exact opposite, sucking all the fun and interest out of the series.  The worst, by far, being Marcus Cole, a ""ranger"" added in season 3 who has thus far served no purpose beyond being an insufferable nuisance.For the vast majority of season 1, I sat through filler episode after filler episode, wondering when the story arcs began.  Then towards the end of the season, the story picked up and I was introduced to highly intriguing bits, including a possible explanation for the mysterious surrender by the Minbari in the Earth-Minbari War, which they were winning.Then season 2 began, and it was back to filler episodes and mediocrity.I noticed this was a trend, as season 3 and season 4 often began with loads of filler episodes, or else episodes that contributed little or nothing to the overall storyarcs.  It seems rather clear that the big story that had been written couldn't fill more than 2 full seasons in a taut manner, and so it was spread over five, and stuffed full of filler and nonstop bad writing and even worse dialogue.As for the stories themselves, they don't come anywhere close to being in any way innovative or original or even particularly compelling.  I was told that the aliens were going to seem at times truly ALIEN compared to humans, and yet again and again I see aliens behaving like humans.  In fact, given the horribly cliche and cartoonish way the humans behave, its actually hte ALIENS who are very human, and the humans who are alien to us real people.But the absolute lowest point in the series regarding aliens came when Commander Ivanova was sent to find some of the First Ones, an ancient alien species that had lived for billions of years before, and is supposedly advanced in all ways and unbelievably complicated beings, and when she finds one, and it refuses to help her because she's working for the Vorlons.... she successfully converts it by using CHILDISH reverse psychology and prodding at its machismo.  She claims ""The Vorlons knew you'd never help them.  After all, they helped you in the last war and you took all the credit"" etcetera.  It was unbelievable that so childish and cliche a gesture would work perfectly.The Shadow storyline overall is a colossal letdown.  Mass Effect's Reapers this ain't, as the Babylon 5 crew and the Vorlons and the Minbari and all their allies prepare to battle this race that is EVIL.  EVIL EVIL EVIL.  Straight and simple.  They're given no motivation or characterization beyond ""BLATANTLY EVIL"".  Given that the strict dichotomy of explicit good and explicit evil is already cliche (as well as virtually nonexistant in reality), it takes some skillful writing and storytelling to pull off the story of ""Good versus Evil"", and that is writing caliber that Babylon 5 has none of.At some point, the motivation of the Shadows is revealed... and it's rather nonsensical.  They try to tempt Sheridan to join them, with the promise of... unending violence and war and death.  NICE PITCH, LOSERS!Then it just ends.  The entire huge, epic war between LIGHT and SHADOW, that was A THOUSAND YEARS IN THE MAKING... ends because Sheridan tells them to GET THE HELL OUT OF OUR GALAXY.Oh that's right.  It turns out that the Vorlons are just as evil as the Shadows, and that the entire reason they're fighting is... well, I don't quite remember, but it had something to do with trying to get lesser races to join their causes.  The analogy given is that of two angry parents squabbling with each other and trying to force their children to side with one of them against the other.  HOW ""ALIEN"" OF THEM!In another overarching storyline, Earth takes a hideous turn for the ""1984""-ish, with the vice president working with these Shadows to have the president murdered, then he becomes president, and begins enacting all the stereotypical signs of oppressive, brutal, tyrannic dictatorship.  Cue Hitler, cue Stalin, cue Castro, cue Pol Pot, cue whoever you want, it's exactly the same.But it's not treated the same.  It's treated almost COMICALLY by the people on Babylon 5 at first.  When the B5 equivalent of the SS, NKVD, Spartan Krypteia, any secret police starts to exert itself, cracking down and oppressing merchants and civilians, arresting people who criticize the government or ask questions, it's given a token ""Baahhh those dang Night Watchers!"" response by the Captain and Commander and others, as if they were Scooby Doo villains.None of this changes until VERY late in the story, when finally they break away from Earth.  After the Shadow War just sort of ends, they turn to dealing with Earth more seriously.I suffered through Star Trek Voyager, I can suffer through the rest of this, but as to the totality of this series, I summarize:-Atrocious, cliche-ridden, painful, childish dialogue-Stale, mediocre writing-Overall below average acting-Hideous visual effects, even as far in as 1997, season 4-Tons of boring filler episodes-One-dimensional, unlikeable human characters-Ridiculous individual episode stories-Unbelievable, unrealistic behavior and responses from characters in certain situations",1,What series

Watch Season 5 through to and including episode ""Objects at Rest""9. Watch the B5 movie ""River of Souls""10. Watch the B5 movie ""In the Beginning""This is a prelude set 10 years before Babylon 5. Against the logic of the title, I would strongly recommend seeing it at this stage. Should one see it before Season 1, much of the suspense in the main series would be ruined.11.

That should give you a glimpse where my review is going.  I don't plan on trying to change anyone's opinion, but I do hope to explain why this series has been a favorite of mine ever since I first saw it.For one thing, it has an epic storyline.  When I say storyline, I mean how it was planned as a 5 season journey.  The series main attraction to me was that it was connected throughout all its seasons, weaving a tale reminiscent of the old space operas.I've been tired of the generic sci-fi at that time (Star Trek, I'm looking at you) that while good, it never really made me want to watch every single episode.  I mean, did it matter that I missed one episode of ST:TNG? Not really, unless it was a two parter, becasue most episodes were self contained and had nothing to do with each other.  Babylon 5 changed that.It was like a book, made into a TV show.  For anyone who has read a long book series, such as The Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, and even Harry Potter, you will understand why one has to keep reading the next book, and the next, and so on.  It's the story, the wanting to know what happens to the characters that drives one to keep on reading.  That's the feeling Babylon 5 gave to me.Some people might complain that Babylon 5 was a lot of dialogue and not enough explosions.  To me, that was the best part, the interaction between the characters, their motivations, their fears, and their failures.To me, Babylon 5 is almost like a love story.  Literally, and figuratively.  For one thing, it was a labor of love from its creator and producers that the series was able to complete its five year run.  The actors certainly loved working on that show as well.  It was a matter of love to the series that kept the fans watching, and it was the love in the Babylon 5 story itself that makes it magic. It was the love of Earth that forces the actions of our main characters, it was the love of each other that brings them together, and it was the love of peace that drives them to fight.So much one can say about this series......but now, I'm going to put in my two cents about this Amazon.com deal.  I believe it's actually quite a smart move for you to buy it this way.  I made the mistake of buying my copies retail and at different places; some places charge up to $100 dollars for each season, while the lowest retail I've seen is around $79.  There also comes the problem of finding them all at the same time.  Most stores don't carry all seasons, so to find them all, you'll need to go store to store.  By using the Amazon.com way (which I wish I could have done myself) you get all the seasons at once, and the price is quite low.Of course, the price is still steep, but consider this - you are looking at about 22 episodes per season, clocking about 45+ minutes each. That means you are looking at about 1000+ minutes per season, times 5, that's roughly about 5000+ minutes of great TV watching.  Now, think about the price of one movie (most of which are around 98 minutes, on average) and then think to yourself how many times you've kicked yourself for wasting 20 bucks on a movie you didn't like? In the end, if you do a numbers game, your are getting more out of one season, than you would out of 4 movies (1 1/2 hours each, 20 bucks each, about 6 hours and $80 dollars) while Babylon 5 (1 season is about 1000+ which is around 15 hours of so, for only $74 at amazon.com).",5,Best bang for your buck...,1108339200,"02 14, 2005",2005,3522,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'think', 'Babylon', '5', 'probably', 'one', 'greatest', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'ever', 'been', 'EVER', 'should', 'give', 'glimpse', 'where', 'review', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'trying', 'change', 'anyone', 'opinion', 'do', 'hope', 'explain', 'why', 'series', 'been', 'favorite', 'mine', 'ever', 'first', 'saw', 'it.For', 'one', 'thing', 'epic', 'storyline', 'When', 'say', 'storyline', 'mean', 'how', 'was', 'planned', '5', 'season', 'journey', 'series', 'main', 'attraction', 'was', 'was', 'connected', 'seasons', 'weaving', 'tale', 'reminiscent', 'old', 'space', 'operas.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tired', 'generic', 'sci-fi', 'time', 'Star', 'Trek', ""'m"", 'looking', 'good', 'never', 'really', 'made', 'want', 'watch', 'single', 'episode', 'mean', 'did', 'matter', 'missed', 'one', 'episode', 'ST', 'TNG', 'Not', 'really', 'was', 'two', 'parter', 'becasue', 'most', 'episodes', 'were', 'self', 'contained', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'other', 'Babylon', '5', 'changed', 'that.It', 'was', 'book', 'made', 'TV', 'show', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'long', 'book', 'series', 'such', 'Wheel', 'Time', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'even', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'will', 'understand', 'why', 'one', 'keep', 'reading', 'next', 'book', 'next', 'so', 'story', 'wanting', 'know', 'what', 'characters', 'one', 'keep', 'reading', 'feeling', 'Babylon', '5', 'gave', 'me.Some', 'people', 'might', 'complain', 'Babylon', '5', 'was', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'not', 'enough', 'explosions', 'was', 'best', 'part', 'interaction', 'characters', 'motivations', 'fears', 'failures.To', 'Babylon', '5', 'almost', 'love', 'story', 'Literally', 'figuratively', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'labor', 'love', 'creator', 'producers', 'series', 'was', 'able', 'complete', 'five', 'year', 'run', 'actors', 'certainly', 'loved', 'working', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'matter', 'love', 'series', 'kept', 'fans', 'watching', 'was', 'love', 'Babylon', '5', 'story', 'magic', 'was', 'love', 'Earth', 'actions', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'love', 'other', 'together', 'was', 'love', 'peace', 'fight.So', 'much', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'series', 'now', ""'m"", 'going', 'put', 'two', 'cents', 'Amazon.com', 'deal', 'believe', 'actually', 'quite', 'smart', 'move', 'buy', 'way', 'made', 'mistake', 'buying', 'copies', 'retail', 'different', 'places', 'places', 'charge', 'up', '100', 'dollars', 'season', 'lowest', 'retail', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'around', '79', 'also', 'problem', 'finding', 'same', 'time', 'Most', 'stores', 'do', ""n't"", 'carry', 'seasons', 'so', 'find', ""'ll"", 'need', 'go', 'store', 'store', 'using', 'Amazon.com', 'way', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'get', 'seasons', 'once', 'price', 'quite', 'low.Of', 'course', 'price', 'still', 'steep', 'consider', 'are', 'looking', '22', 'episodes', 'season', 'clocking', '45+', 'minutes', 'are', 'looking', '1000+', 'minutes', 'season', '5', 'roughly', '5000+', 'minutes', 'great', 'TV', 'watching', 'Now', 'think', 'price', 'one', 'movie', 'most', 'are', '98', 'minutes', 'average', 'then', 'think', 'yourself', 'how', 'many', 'times', ""'ve"", 'kicked', 'wasting', '20', 'bucks', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'end', 'do', 'numbers', 'game', 'are', 'getting', 'more', 'one', 'season', 'would', 'out', '4', 'movies', '1', '1/2', 'hours', '20', 'bucks', 'about', '6', 'hours', '80', 'dollars', '5', '1', 'season', '1000+', '15', 'hours', 'so', 'only', '74', 'amazon.com']",Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series

In actuality, the theme, or perhaps I shold say a subsidiary theme, was a religious one in so far as each alien race's religion is presented; the creator of the series did not promote any one religion, human or alien, but seemed to state that religion---in whatever form---is good. Each race, it becomes very evident throughout the series, has both its good and evil citizens. The special effects, acting, and plots were excellent and things really pick up when the Shadows appear, which serve as a catalyst for all the other aliens and humans to band together to defeat them (as in the Nazis during WW II).

It tackled the monumental task of creating a universe with as diverse a background as Star Trek and Star Wars with an ease during the first season that astonished and impressed me.2. This was one of the first television series to take advantage of a modern day, video recording, audience. After the introductory season one, it pretty much abandoned the traditional, hour-long one shot episodes that prevailed through much of the 60's, 70's and even into the late 80's and early 90's. Instead, there were ongoing storylines that could - and did! - eventually explode in a blast of dramatic television unexpectedly during key episodes.3. Some of the alien characters are fearsome. But it is the ones who look almost ridiculous, that in the end, can turn out to be the most bloodthirsty and who do the most damage.4. This is an astonishing, wonderful television series. If you love science fiction, or any deep and penetrating story with intelligent dialogue, then Babylon 5, the short-lived Crusade series, and its associated movies are just what you're looking for.5. In my corner of the universe, Babylon 5 aired very late at night, right after Deep Space Nine.

Had I not been assured by a friend that the first few episodes were not on a par with the rest of the series, I wouldn't have made it past those first episodes. The opening of Babylon 5, I must say, is terrible. Everything from the writing to the acting to the music is truly second rate.HOWEVER:It plants the seeds of a story that was so well planned that throughout its entire run, everything remains consistent with the plot-points and characterizations that are established from the beginning.Babylon 5 does what all the best science fiction (its rival DS9, the updated Battlestar Galactica) does: it lets the characters and emotions drive the story, even when the overall plot gets rather intricate. Stories play out over long stretches of time, characters grow and develop, relationships form and develop or dissolve. It is a testament to the strength of the characters that the final episode of the series is perhaps the finest of its whole run, built upon the powerful emotions that come with saying goodbye.I have more criticisms of Babylon 5 than I do of any other show that I would consider top-tier. Like The West Wing, it is nearly entirely written by one man, and his voice - though it is of course the genius behind the series - can lead to a lack of diversity in conversational style. The acting ranges from excellent (the actors playing aliens are uniformly excellent, as is Bruce Boxleitner) to mediocre, to terrible (Michael O'Hare is one of the worst actors EVER; Jerry Doyle and Patricia Tallman are the primary offenders by the end). The show was forced to wrap things up in the 4th season, then was surprisingly renewed for a 5th season - had they known they had this season available, the Shadow War would have been brought to a more satisfying conclusion.But the show survives my criticisms because of its strengths. The rise of G'Kar and the fall of Londo Mollarri is one of the most impressive pieces of storytelling ever committed to film. The flaws of the characters feel real and logical. The truly deep and original plotting sustains a very complicated story over five years.The dvd set is well put together, with each disc well protected, and some very interesting commentaries from series creator J. Michael Straczynski.

This is not just a great science-fiction series, but  also a fantastically written and acted long epic. The series reads like an old fashioned novel. It is deep , it is rich, the carachters are extremely well drawn out and interesting , filled with flaws but also greatness in equal measure. It is a story that involves not only into the adventure but into the process of growth of the people and the worlds it describes. What I really like about babylon 5 is that it touches on so many important topics, such as the connection between one's actions and the consequences of those actions, the need to sometimes stand alone and firm with one's truth even when inconvenient, the nature of light and dark, the meaning of the struggle between good and evil, the meaning of true courage, the consequences of cowardice and self-interest, the dynamics of power and corruption in governments and the role of the individual in creating change at a collective level. JMS, the writer of this series, is a smart, sensitive and deep man that obviously had something very important to say through this series that he wrote almost singlehandedly - something that apparently is very unusual in television. And it is my feeling that he got his message across very well, helped by a superb cast of amazing actors that brought to life these very unique carachters in a way that , after a while, you really belive that they are real. Londo Molari, G'kar, Delenn, Ivanova...how could these carachters, so full and complex, be just the creation of somebody's mind? JMS and his team really created something special with this series, a universe that is consistent and real and exciting in which a magnificent story unfolds. Watch this series without skipping one episode as you will loose some of the story if you don't.

810385,A2GM883SM9R942,B0001M3MXY,"Charles Miller ""objective clarity""","[3, 4]","There's not much I can add to previous reviewers. However, after having the pleasure to watch this series again after all these years, I am struck by how well it started out and how it slid, especially after the 3rd season.The greatest reason for this was indeed because I had the opportunity to view the entire series in approximately one month's time instead of over the course of five years. When season 4 starts, one is immediately struck by the lower production values. This, of course, is not the fault of the writers, actors or anybody directly involved with the creative end of the show. It was the fault of the powers that be to lower the budget.While the first seasons featured a large cast that included speaking roles for minor characters, the last two seasons are characterized by those dreadful extras that just silently walk around in the background and hardly react to the action that is taking place just a few feet away from them. Even characters who are important to the stories being told are relegated to extras who have no speaking lines. What a shame.The 5th season is by far the low point and again, this doesn't appear to the fault of the creative team. I was told (but could be wrong), that Babylon 5 was cancelled after its 4th season. As a result, the last episode of season 4 appears to the wrap-up of the series. Indeed, after watching it, there doesn't seem to be much more of a story to be told. And such is the case. If my source was correct, season 5 appears to be a collection of episodes with no real central focus or on-going story (i.e.: The Shadows War).Don't misread these complaints as anything more than objective observations of the effects of budget cuts. Overall, this series brought more to the television science fiction table than any other. Indeed, it was probably the best of all time. Events that seemed relatively irrelevant from early seasons come back in a big way in subsequent ones that gave this series a cohesiveness that no other show has ever attempted. You really couldn't miss so much as one episode to follow the story. An epic story in the truest sense of the word. But again, it remains a shame that it wasn't funded properly from beginning to end.",4,5 stars for seasons 1 & 2 & 3 ...and downhill from there,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,2213,"['not', 'much', 'can', 'add', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'However', 'having', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'series', 'again', 'years', 'am', 'struck', 'how', 'well', 'started', 'out', 'how', 'slid', 'especially', '3rd', 'season.The', 'greatest', 'reason', 'was', 'indeed', 'had', 'opportunity', 'view', 'entire', 'series', 'approximately', 'one', 'month', 'time', 'instead', 'course', 'five', 'years', 'When', 'season', '4', 'starts', 'one', 'immediately', 'struck', 'lower', 'production', 'values', 'course', 'not', 'fault', 'writers', 'actors', 'anybody', 'directly', 'involved', 'creative', 'end', 'show', 'was', 'fault', 'powers', 'be', 'lower', 'budget.While', 'first', 'seasons', 'featured', 'large', 'cast', 'included', 'speaking', 'roles', 'minor', 'characters', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'characterized', 'dreadful', 'extras', 'just', 'silently', 'walk', 'background', 'hardly', 'react', 'action', 'taking', 'place', 'just', 'few', 'feet', 'away', 'Even', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'important', 'stories', 'being', 'told', 'are', 'relegated', 'extras', 'who', 'have', 'speaking', 'lines', 'What', 'shame.The', '5th', 'season', 'far', 'low', 'point', 'again', ""n't"", 'appear', 'fault', 'creative', 'team', 'was', 'told', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'Babylon', '5', 'was', 'cancelled', '4th', 'season', 'result', 'last', 'episode', 'season', '4', 'wrap-up', 'series', 'Indeed', 'watching', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'be', 'told', 'such', 'case', 'source', 'was', 'correct', 'season', '5', 'be', 'collection', 'episodes', 'real', 'central', 'focus', 'on-going', 'story', 'i.e', 'Shadows', 'War', '.Do', ""n't"", 'misread', 'complaints', 'anything', 'more', 'objective', 'observations', 'effects', 'budget', 'cuts', 'Overall', 'series', 'brought', 'more', 'television', 'science', 'fiction', 'table', 'other', 'Indeed', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'time', 'Events', 'seemed', 'relatively', 'irrelevant', 'early', 'seasons', 'come', 'back', 'big', 'way', 'subsequent', 'ones', 'gave', 'series', 'cohesiveness', 'other', 'show', 'ever', 'attempted', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'miss', 'so', 'much', 'one', 'episode', 'follow', 'story', 'epic', 'story', 'truest', 'sense', 'word', 'again', 'shame', 'was', ""n't"", 'funded', 'properly', 'beginning', 'end']",Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series
810386,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B0001M3MXY,"C. Hill ""CFH""","[2, 2]","Babylon 5 is truly one of the most enjoyable and intelligent Sci-Fi series. We missed the series when it aired on TV but, at the urging of my NASA Engineer sister, picked it up on DVD. We (my wife and two teens) watched the entire series (and all of the movies,Babylon 5 - The Movie Collection) straight through over a two month period.The first season of Babylon 5 is, by almost all accounts, the weakest of the five. The second season really is much better than season one, and fortunately we were warned that this was the case by my sister so we stuck it out. Season one did get much better in the last few episodes as the characters started to gel and the back stories came to light.The biggest problem with season one (besides the clunky dialog) was the character Commander Jeffery Sinclair (Michael O'Hare). He really just didn't fill the role well, had very bad lines, and was played like one of puppets fromThunderbirds Megaset (Complete 12 Volume Set). I am happy that this really is only a first season issue as this problem is resolved at the start of season two.Babylon 5 really hits its stride in Season 2, with much better acting, great story lines, and seriously strong character development. The biggest improvement was in the casting change, replacing Commander Jeffery Sinclair with Captain John Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) in the first episode of this season.I really like the way the way the show runs sub-plots through multiple episodes and, like real life, events in past episodes effect events in future episodes. We also see the groundwork being laid for the upcoming Shadow War and for several side plot lines.The special effects were still somewhat weak, but considering that this show was made in the '90s, they are passable.Season 3 was perhaps the best one of Babylon 5. There is very good acting, great story lines, and strong characters.There are very few ""stand alone"" episodes as many of the plots lines now span the entire season. There are serious issues to be addresses with EarthGov, Psi-Cops, Alien Alliances, The Shadows, and the occasional freelancer. We also see romantic relationships, friendships form, and a new major character is added. Marcus Cole (Jason Carter) joins the station as a ""Ranger"", he is a good addition and brings a lot to the series.There is plenty of drama, action and the occasional surprise to keep the viewer engaged in the story. As with the previous seasons, the special effects are still somewhat weak.Season 4 of Babylon 5 was very good and brought most of the outstanding plot lines from the previous seasons to a close. It seemed that things were very rushed to wrap up the Shadow War and the conflict with EarthGov, but as I understand it this was going to be the final season before it was unexpectedly extended for an additional season.This season follows the excellent season 3 and only falls a little short because of the rushed pace. There are some great (and frustrating) character developments that has the B5 command staff and the various Ambassadors split up a lot of the time performing various missions. There are also a lot of well thought out ship-to-ship battles that work to show how much thought went into making this series believable.The fifth season of Babylon 5 was the final in the series. While not as strong as seasons 3 and 4, it was still very watchable.There were lot of good episodes but the final one, ""Sleeping in Light"", was very good, does a nice job wrapping the series up, and is somewhat of a ""Tear Jerker"". It was bittersweet as it was good to finally get to the end (we watched all 5 season and all of the movies over a two month period), but we didn't really want the show to be over.This was a great way to see the entire series and it was well worth the investment in both time and money!Highly Recommended!",5,Great Sci-Fi Series - Highly Recommended!,1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,3819,"['Babylon', '5', 'truly', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'intelligent', 'Sci-Fi', 'series', 'missed', 'series', 'when', 'aired', 'TV', 'urging', 'NASA', 'Engineer', 'sister', 'picked', 'up', 'DVD', 'wife', 'two', 'teens', 'watched', 'entire', 'series', 'movies', 'Babylon', '5', 'Movie', 'Collection', 'straight', 'two', 'month', 'period.The', 'first', 'season', 'Babylon', '5', 'almost', 'accounts', 'weakest', 'five', 'second', 'season', 'really', 'much', 'better', 'season', 'one', 'fortunately', 'were', 'warned', 'was', 'case', 'sister', 'stuck', 'out', 'Season', 'one', 'did', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'characters', 'started', 'gel', 'back', 'stories', 'came', 'light.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'season', 'one', 'clunky', 'dialog', 'was', 'character', 'Commander', 'Jeffery', 'Sinclair', 'Michael', ""O'Hare"", 'really', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fill', 'role', 'well', 'had', 'very', 'bad', 'lines', 'was', 'played', 'one', 'puppets', 'fromThunderbirds', 'Megaset', 'Complete', '12', 'Volume', 'Set', 'am', 'happy', 'really', 'only', 'first', 'season', 'issue', 'problem', 'resolved', 'start', 'season', 'two.Babylon', '5', 'really', 'stride', 'Season', '2', 'much', 'better', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'lines', 'seriously', 'strong', 'character', 'development', 'biggest', 'improvement', 'was', 'casting', 'change', 'replacing', 'Commander', 'Jeffery', 'Sinclair', 'Captain', 'John', 'Sheridan', 'Bruce', 'Boxleitner', 'first', 'episode', 'season.I', 'really', 'way', 'way', 'show', 'sub-plots', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'past', 'episodes', 'effect', 'events', 'future', 'episodes', 'also', 'see', 'groundwork', 'being', 'laid', 'upcoming', 'Shadow', 'War', 'several', 'side', 'plot', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'still', 'somewhat', 'weak', 'considering', 'show', 'was', 'made', ""'90s"", 'are', 'passable.Season', '3', 'was', 'perhaps', 'best', 'one', 'Babylon', '5', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'great', 'story', 'lines', 'strong', 'characters.There', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'many', 'plots', 'lines', 'now', 'span', 'entire', 'season', 'are', 'serious', 'issues', 'be', 'addresses', 'EarthGov', 'Psi-Cops', 'Alien', 'Alliances', 'Shadows', 'occasional', 'freelancer', 'also', 'see', 'romantic', 'relationships', 'friendships', 'form', 'new', 'major', 'character', 'added', 'Marcus', 'Cole', 'Jason', 'Carter', 'station', 'Ranger', 'good', 'addition', 'lot', 'series.There', 'plenty', 'drama', 'action', 'occasional', 'surprise', 'keep', 'viewer', 'engaged', 'story', 'previous', 'seasons', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'still', 'somewhat', 'weak.Season', '4', 'Babylon', '5', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'brought', 'most', 'outstanding', 'plot', 'lines', 'previous', 'seasons', 'close', 'seemed', 'things', 'were', 'very', 'rushed', 'wrap', 'up', 'Shadow', 'War', 'conflict', 'EarthGov', 'understand', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'unexpectedly', 'extended', 'additional', 'season.This', 'season', 'excellent', 'season', '3', 'only', 'little', 'short', 'rushed', 'pace', 'are', 'great', 'frustrating', 'character', 'developments', 'B5', 'command', 'staff', 'various', 'Ambassadors', 'split', 'up', 'lot', 'time', 'performing', 'various', 'missions', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'ship-to-ship', 'battles', 'work', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'thought', 'went', 'making', 'series', 'believable.The', 'fifth', 'season', 'Babylon', '5', 'was', 'final', 'series', 'not', 'as', 'strong', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'watchable.There', 'were', 'lot', 'good', 'episodes', 'final', 'one', 'Sleeping', 'Light', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'nice', 'job', 'wrapping', 'series', 'up', 'somewhat', 'Tear', 'Jerker', 'was', 'bittersweet', 'was', 'good', 'finally', 'get', 'end', 'watched', '5', 'season', 'movies', 'two', 'month', 'period', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'show', 'be', 'over.This', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'see', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'well', 'investment', 'time', 'money', 'Highly', 'Recommended']",Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series
810387,A1NP91R1CRPNQX,B0001M3MXY,"Christopher R. Travers ""Einhverfr""","[1, 1]","I am in the middle of watching B5 for the fourth of fifth time, this time with my seven year old son, and having recently read much in the way of early epics all at once (Beowulf: A Verse Translation (Penguin Classics),The Saga of King Hrolf Kraki (Penguin Classics),The Saga of the Volsungs (Penguin Classics), and theMahabharata) as well as books on the epic format (Orality and Literacy (New Accents)andThe Singer of Tales).  Eventually I noticed that the format was not that of a movie or a novel (as the author and many fans tend to suggest), but rather of an epic (or rather as close to that of an epic that we get in these modern times).  It's not ""Casablanca in Space,"" but rather ""The Mahabharata in Space"" or maybe ""The Illiad in Space.""The basic premise of the series is that a space station which has been built to be essentially a futuristic version of the UN and has a mission to prevent war becomes in essence a nexus for the coordination in the greatest war in a thousand years.  The series lasts five seasons and (like the Mahabharata) includes a prolonged prologue and a prolonged epilogue.  The ""extended miniseries"" format requires the audience to watch small stories suited to a single sitting but also connected and interwoven in a complex way, following a greater arc.  Some have compared it to a soap opera but that's not a very apt description.The acting does not start off as well as it might, although some characters do very very well from the beginning.  As the characters settle into their roles, things become much, much better.The series is full of mythological elements, and includes great commentaries on religious faith and sacrifice, as well as heroism, as much as these are generally lacking from sci-fi series generally.  Each race has their own sets of religions:  the Narn follow a system of prophets which reminds me of Islam, while the Minbari follow a religion that reminds me of modern Hinduism, and the Cenauri follow a sort of henotheistic paganism based seemingly on Roman models.In any event, the series leaves one to think about many of these things.  Yet in the final analysis what makes a mark is the heroism that leads to undying fame on the part of several of the characters.  In this regard it strikes me much more as an Indo-European epic, than it does a modern tale despite the setting.Most people I have shared the series with have greatly enjoyed it.  A few have not.

Nataf,"[3, 3]","I bought this DVD pack because I had positive brief memories of B5 (it was never on), I liked other scifi, and other people seemed to rate B5 very highly. When I started watching season 1 I was a bit heartbroken... it seemed not very good, very cheesy. I almost returned it to amazon upon looking up their return policies.By the time I got to episode 5 I was hooked. The storyline is simply excellent, spanning several empires, several wars, empires at various stages of development, et cetera. Unlike in Star Trek the humans are *not* the most advanced species around, which is refreshing. The physics was sound... the station actually has to rotate for articial gravity to take place, a refreshing change. There are few clear good guys and bad guys, and a broad spectrum in between, it's easy to see all sides. The story is cohesive in my opinion.One complaint: the DVDs were of low quality.

810391,A2EYYAKH4VF70T,B0001M3MXY,David N. Reiss,"[14, 18]","Babylon 5 was one of the best television series ever in the medium. Taken for all in all, it was the best SF/F show ever on television.  This was because it didn't dodge the big questions:Who are we?What do we want?Where are we going?It made the big questions the central focus of the series.  It didn't always provide clear and succinct answers to them either.  It also made things very much like they are in the real world.  Impure or evil motives might lead to actions with overall good outcomes, and good intentions may well pave the road to hell.J. Michael Straczynski is the reason is stayed focus on the large themes. JMS created the series and wrote all the episodes of the session, as well as all the 4th session episodes.  He was specifically looked to create myths that addressed the big questions in life.You can't address the big issues without acknowledging the reasons that most people stop thinking about them: the minutia of life often makes us focus on little things that often don't bear on the larger issues. JMS wrote the series in a way that the big questions came into line with the little issues of life.His focus also allowed for characters to grow and change over the course of the series.  For example, Vir, a character that starts off as a basic comic-relief player, yet ends up as one of those who can speak with great wisdom.  The third session was when this change in him became evident.  Also, the characters are not all perfect examples of morality and heroism: they each have their strengths and faults.  This makes things much more believable.  Especially since much of the underlying stories of good vs. evil is rather fanciful.  In order to make it all believable is requires that there are underlying things that make sense, so that the home viewer can grab a handle on the program in order to anchor the rest of the story.The normal human issues of alcoholism, drug addition, religion, family problems, bad marriages, etc. all get explored in the course of the show.  Which adds to the believability aspects of the program.Many other shows with similar takes on the world of character development have been ""St. Elsewhere"", ""Six Feet Under"" and ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"".The acting in the show is normally good, with especially good performances by Andreas Katsulas as G'Kar and Peter Jurasik as Londo Mollari.The first season is very rough, with about half the shows from it being almost bad at times.  The second season things got a lot better. The third session of Babylon 5 is probably the best of the five sessions the program was on the air.  But the fourth session was very close in quality to the third.  The fifth was weird... very well made, and at times very well written, but in the end the 5th season was about the same in quality as the second.  Which would have been fine if it had come before season three and four.One of the minor overall problems with the show is that, although clean and succinct answers are not always provided, they are sometimes forced in when they shouldn't have been.  I am sure that this was not the intention all the time of the shows creative force: JMS.  It is just that it is expected in TV land that they be provided.  Basically, I am sure they were sometimes added because TV executives probably insisted on them.  Especially when the message sometimes is that ""there is no clear message"".  Which, at times makes the show feel a little clunky.I know that my criticism of this sounds almost like I am contradicting myself.  And that may be the problem with it in the show... maybe the show is contradicting itself in some ways.",5,B5 was a great show,1081036800,"04 4, 2004",2004,3615,"['Babylon', '5', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'series', 'ever', 'medium', 'Taken', 'was', 'best', 'SF/F', 'show', 'ever', 'television', 'was', 'did', ""n't"", 'dodge', 'big', 'questions', 'Who', 'are', 'What', 'do', 'want', 'Where', 'are', 'going', 'made', 'big', 'questions', 'central', 'focus', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'provide', 'clear', 'succinct', 'answers', 'either', 'also', 'made', 'things', 'very', 'much', 'are', 'real', 'world', 'Impure', 'evil', 'motives', 'might', 'lead', 'actions', 'overall', 'good', 'outcomes', 'good', 'intentions', 'may', 'well', 'pave', 'road', 'hell.J', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'reason', 'stayed', 'focus', 'large', 'themes', 'JMS', 'created', 'series', 'wrote', 'episodes', 'session', 'as', 'well', '4th', 'session', 'episodes', 'was', 'specifically', 'looked', 'create', 'myths', 'addressed', 'big', 'questions', 'life.You', 'ca', ""n't"", 'address', 'big', 'issues', 'acknowledging', 'reasons', 'most', 'people', 'stop', 'thinking', 'minutia', 'life', 'often', 'focus', 'little', 'things', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'bear', 'larger', 'issues', 'JMS', 'wrote', 'series', 'way', 'big', 'questions', 'came', 'line', 'little', 'issues', 'life.His', 'focus', 'also', 'allowed', 'characters', 'grow', 'change', 'course', 'series', 'example', 'Vir', 'character', 'off', 'basic', 'comic-relief', 'player', 'yet', 'up', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'speak', 'great', 'wisdom', 'third', 'session', 'was', 'when', 'change', 'became', 'evident', 'Also', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'examples', 'morality', 'heroism', 'have', 'strengths', 'faults', 'things', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'Especially', 'much', 'underlying', 'stories', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'rather', 'fanciful', 'order', 'make', 'believable', 'are', 'underlying', 'things', 'make', 'sense', 'home', 'viewer', 'can', 'grab', 'handle', 'program', 'order', 'anchor', 'rest', 'story.The', 'normal', 'human', 'issues', 'alcoholism', 'drug', 'addition', 'religion', 'family', 'problems', 'bad', 'marriages', 'etc', 'get', 'explored', 'course', 'show', 'Which', 'believability', 'aspects', 'program.Many', 'other', 'shows', 'similar', 'world', 'character', 'development', 'have', 'been', 'St', 'Elsewhere', 'Six', 'Feet', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', '.The', 'acting', 'show', 'normally', 'good', 'especially', 'good', 'performances', 'Andreas', 'Katsulas', ""G'Kar"", 'Peter', 'Jurasik', 'Londo', 'Mollari.The', 'first', 'season', 'very', 'rough', 'shows', 'being', 'almost', 'bad', 'times', 'second', 'season', 'things', 'got', 'lot', 'better', 'third', 'session', 'Babylon', '5', 'probably', 'best', 'five', 'sessions', 'program', 'was', 'air', 'fourth', 'session', 'was', 'very', 'close', 'quality', 'third', 'fifth', 'was', 'weird', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'times', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'end', '5th', 'season', 'was', 'same', 'quality', 'second', 'Which', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'had', 'come', 'season', 'three', 'four.One', 'minor', 'overall', 'problems', 'show', 'clean', 'succinct', 'answers', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'provided', 'are', 'sometimes', 'forced', 'when', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'am', 'sure', 'was', 'not', 'intention', 'time', 'shows', 'creative', 'force', 'JMS', 'just', 'expected', 'TV', 'land', 'be', 'provided', 'Basically', 'am', 'sure', 'were', 'sometimes', 'added', 'TV', 'executives', 'probably', 'insisted', 'Especially', 'when', 'message', 'sometimes', 'clear', 'message', 'Which', 'times', 'show', 'feel', 'little', 'clunky.I', 'know', 'criticism', 'almost', 'am', 'contradicting', 'may', 'be', 'problem', 'show', 'maybe', 'show', 'contradicting', 'ways']",Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series
810392,A2EIKI4ZYV8VU7,B0001M3MXY,"D. K. Hingle ""justkes""","[148, 154]","J. Michael Straczynski (jms) created the space station Babylon 5 and spent years getting it produced and on the air. It premiered about the same time ST: Deep Space Nine did, and for a while, fans compared the two. It was almost ""apples & oranges"" time, but it was tried.As a long-time Trek fan, I was surprised when I first saw the pilot (""The Gathering"") in 1993. I was absolutely stunned. Why Babylon 5, not just Babylon Station? Well, #s 1 - 4 were sabotaged & destroyed; # 4 disappeared after going on-line. (Disappeared? It's 5 MILES LONG, for crying out loud!) Word was that this would be an on-going, progressive five year story arc, the likes of which hadn't been done before on US television. Risky.  Okay, jms had my attention.  I couldn't wait for the series.  When it finally did air, I (being cynical of tv production in general) figured it wasn't going to stay as good. It didn't. It steadily got better.I repeat, I speak as a long time Trek fan (beginning with the original series - skip Voyager, I did). B5 is one of the best televison series ever produced. Note I did not say ""science fiction series."" (It is THE best s/f series ever put up to the audience.) I introduced several non s/f fans to the series, as a dramatic series and they all loved it. (So much for ""only for space opera hounds."")  The story arc freed Straczynski (he wrote 90% of the scripts) from having to make everything ""come right"" in a 45 minute time slot, and off it went.Crowd scenes were, well, crowded, with humans of all types and aliens as extras wandering through scenes. (The aliens, by the way, are much more than odd skin colours, strange noses and ""hair."") The station wasn't pristeen, the population wasn't always picture perfect. We have shysters, homeless, personal problems, espionage, humour, betrayal, relationships, and deaths (being in the opening credits did not guarantee survival, and it didn't always happen at the end of a season). Opening credits and theme music changed every year.  One character's very appearance even changed dramatically.  The plotlines are tight, and the threads are woven into five years of shows. The special effects are believable. (Yes, you could ""hear"" space battles, but hey, cut them some slack - NASA asked for plans of the Starfuries for reference for future space station repair vehicles.) B5 was the first show to rely on CGI effects, born out of budget necessity. More than once, watching the show, I found myself pounding the furniture with excitement - and we won't go into (here) what I did during series finale ""Sleeping in Light.""Sinclair, Sheridan, Ivanova, Garibaldi, G'Kar, Londo, Lennier, Vir, Na'Toth, Talia, and Lyta came into our home as people with problems. The characters grew and changed and made choices and dealt with the consequences of those choices for good or bad. G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) put it best: no one on Babylon 5 is exactly what they appear.  Keep a score card handy:  this week's ally may be next month's enemy.  There is no clear deliniation of good guys and bad guys - mostly it's all shades of grey. Acting (with the exception of one season five regular) is superb.Action, yes.  Yet one of the most moving episodes is a one-on-one battle of wits and nerve between two characters in a single room.  Wars - some with aliens, some between alien races, and some with just us humans - start & end.  There are four ambassadors from alien races on board, with a League of Non-Aligned Worlds to complete the roster.  Telepaths of all races (except the Narns) add more colour.  Intrigue, smuggling, dealing, double-dealing, romance, all leavened with humourous touches throughout - what more could you ask!For the first four years, the hardest part of being a B5 fan was FINDING it. (Our local station played ping-pong with its time slot.) To own uncut, widescreen versions on DVD of the whole story arc was a dream we had. Thank heavens, it's one dream which became reality.If you have seen B5, welcome back.  If  you haven't, welcome aboard.  However, Babylon 5 is a whole complete story, with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  View it that way.  Start with the pilot (""The Gathering,"" not included in this set but available) and then move to Season One.  Enjoy.

Very satisfying if you have an engineer streak in your DNA--for example, human spaceships have gravity because they have centrifuge sections, and they're rectangular because, duh, they're in space.2. Equally satisfying if you follow international politics and know how murky right/wrong turn out to be in the real world. One of the actors came from the former Yugoslavia, and her friends would ask her why all the plots were (to them) based on Balkan politics.3. A five year plot arc really uses the many individual episodes to tell a complex, compelling, overall story, sometimes with characters you thought were good or evil turning out to be otherwise or somewhere in between.4. A scientific and anthropological perspective portraying us humans as interstellar newcomers who only got there with borrowed technology, and by no means the top dogs.5. Individual characters you can relate to in all their noble and not so noble traits.Weaknesses:1. screenwriting that falls short of brilliance. Workmanlike, serviceable, nothing annoyingly flowery--but you aren't going to see its scripts examined in English departments like Buffy the Vampire Slayers scripts are.2. special effects that fall far short of what is achievable today. Not funky as Red Dwarf or laughable like the original Dr. Who, but nothing like, for example, ""WALL-E."" Again, they're workmanlike, they aren't annoying, but they won't thrill you either.3. Acting like the screenwriting--serviceable but not sublime. One of the main characters is a poor man's Bruce Willis--that's fun. And two of the aliens are played with great gusto (G'Kar and Londo Molari). A secondary character--a commercial telepath--was also a stunt double on Star Trek. But by far the biggest shortcoming came from the show's creator firing Claudia Christian and replacing her in the last year with a new character who lacked Christian's flair.If you come at it with the right expectations you'll be happy you got this series.

Having just trashed the new B-5 movie, I want to urge anyone with even the slightest interest to buy the complete original series.  It's not perfect.  Some episodes are true turkeys.  And the fifth season was pretty terrible (except for the last episode ""Sleeping in Light"").  Other reviews will give you specifics.  Here it is noted that this series manages to tell a story as grand as ""War and Peace.""  Many of the episodes are more than entertainment.  They actually have something to say.

810398,A32HEH9BZ1B0KY,B0001M3MXY,Faramarz Rabii,"[16, 17]","This is one of the greatest Sci-Fi stories every made in Film. I won't go into the details of the story as there is so much information already out there. However the structure is a masterpiece. The main ingredients of success are:1) The story was put together whole before the first episode was filmed.2) The writer i.e. JMS kept a tight rein on the production and made it true to his story.3) The story was greater than any actor, and therefore able to survive the loss of any actor intact.4) There are lots of mysteries which are revealed piece by piece over the course of the story.There are other promising films which were made at the same time. X-Files is a perfect example. X-File however, fails where Babylon-5 succeeds. The main reason being that B5 is a complete story, while X-Files just presents mysteries that are never resolved.The only real drawback is that B5 was meant to be done over the course of 5 years, perhaps that is why it is named B5! Alas, JMS was forced to bring the story to end in 4 years fearing its premature cancellation by the network. This made season 4 a bit rushed. Once season 5 did get funded JMS had to look for material to fill it in. In my opinion he missed the best ""filler"" which was: the story of Centuari. This story has since been written up in a trilogy of books. It would have made a wonderful 6 parter in the 5th season!Nevertheless it is as close to perfection as any TV series has got to. Therefore it deserves a 5. Since then JMS has produced material that while good, do not reach this level.

But at least the aliens don't all rely on forehead prosthetics ala Star Trek.  If you've never seen it, it's worth watching.

And after I sat through the entire first season after my buddy begged be to, I still wasn't all that interested. But I continued watching, and there came a point where I didn't stop saying ""Holy crap OMGWTF they did NOT just do that!!!"" until the series ended. It's just stunning, it really is. Somehow, I never got tired of Sheridan's neverending melodramatic rants and speeches, or of Ivanova's bottomless well of Russian cynicism, or of Delenn's infinite Minbari wisdom. Nor did I get tired of the amazingly crappy-looking, almost Tron-like space battles. I mean, for the love of Buddah, the space battles in War Planets looked better than this. But none of that really mattered, because it was a five-year story arc all planned out from the beginning. JMS played an entire hand of trump cards, entire civilizations rose and fell, wars were waged and major characters got waxed. There were enough revelations to make a person dizzy. Star Trek and Farscape are ""good,"" but Babylon 5 showed its viewers what it takes for a show to truly be called ""Great""Unfortunately, there was fear that the show would not get a fifth season, so the story arc was heavily abbreviated in the fourth season, with the ""Shadow War"" being comprised of a whopping two battles, and then stretched too thin in the fifth. The ""Telepath War"" that had been built up to for 4 seasons was a huge disappointment, and the evil, personality-deprived skank hoe that took over the station was a very poor substitute for Susan Ivanova. The void left by Ivanova was partially filled by Lyta Alexander's newfound kinkiness and power-tripping, which are a lot of fun to watch.So while B5 is certainly not without its flaws, and while Andromeda is easily the best overall space show to date, I believe that this show, by virtue of the ambition behind it and the decent execution thereof, should be mandatory viewing for anyone who has ever watched television.

810403,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0001M3MXY,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","To compact the distant future of the cosmic universe into five or six years is a prodigy of ingenuity. We have to go beyond this time line, or rather short segment, and accept to put duration in what is seen as an accelerated reading of some crazy DVD. If we get beyond that shortened time line, we can then enjoy the whole story. Enjoy the action, the creativity of all kinds of intelligent species and their technologies, including the advanced DNA manipulations by the Shadows and the Vorlons to produce more advanced ""human"" brains. We can enjoy the human relations between the main characters, be they human or not. We can also enjoy the great creativity of the cosmic world, Babylon 5 itself, this five mile long cosmic station, the various spacecrafts, and many other creations, including of course the most obscure, dark and shadowy predators if not vampires who use other species to achieve their objectives. Then we can concentrate on some of the main characters. Captain Sinclair does not last much more than the first season, with a fugitive apparition later on. Captain Sheridan is not always the humane man and authority we would like him to be, especially when he becomes a politician. The ambassadors, Mombary De Lenn, Santori Lando or Nan G-Kar, become indispensable fixtures in the big saga and their evolution is funny in a way. De Lenn becomes the wife of Terrian President Sheridan when he takes the head of the Coalition. Lando becomes the prisoner of a shadowy spider that makes him the slave of a predator species, in spite of his being the Emperor of the Santori Republic. The funnier transformation is that of G-Kar who shifts from a real stubborn pain in the ass to a victimized refugee and finally to a seer, a guru, a prophet of peace for his own people and among the various species. Doctor Franklin is attractive in his doubts and certitudes to be the servant of human ethics in his own profession generalized to the whole universe. Garibaldi the reformed alcoholic who relapses, the head of security used as a weapon by the Psy Corps, the fascist mental police of the Earth, against Sheridan himself, and then ending as a corporation CEO on Mars, is in a way funny ah ah and humane. But beyond you have two axioms that reveal an ideology. The first axiom is that the cosmos produces many intelligent species but that all the present and rather recent species are humanoids in a way or another. Only two older species that live beyond the rim of hyperspace have developed a higher level of intelligence, the Shadows and the Vorlons. They represent two visions of cosmic history. The Shadows are beings of darkness in the shape of some multi-legged black spiders and they believe the species must fight one against the others to enable progress through natural selection, and the Vorlons who are aerial beings of light consider progress can only come through a political treatment of the objective of bringing the various species together. That's of course nave. The liberals versus the neo-conservatives. Clinton versus Bush. Primitive thinking. But the second characteristic emerges from the whole series. The history of all these intelligent species can only be written through wars, either coming from their own wickedness or from the enslavement to some fundamentally bellicose incompatible species. That's even more than pessimistic. That's the belief nothing can come from peace, understanding, cooperation. In that vision there is no real collective future and peace can only be the peace one feels and cultivates in one's own mind in the middle of a deeply disrupted and aggressive world. Peace in one's mind in the middle of a suicide bombing attack, but apparently for the suicide bomber's own mind. That's the worst part of that saga. And the Terrian humans cut a particularly vicious and hypocritical role in that deeply grotesque warmongering discourse.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Vincennes Saint Denis, University of Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID Boulogne Billancourt",5,I love the saga though it is pretty pessimistic but entertaining,1265241600,"02 4, 2010",2010,4068,"['compact', 'distant', 'future', 'cosmic', 'universe', 'five', 'six', 'years', 'prodigy', 'ingenuity', 'have', 'go', 'time', 'line', 'rather', 'short', 'segment', 'accept', 'put', 'duration', 'what', 'seen', 'accelerated', 'reading', 'crazy', 'DVD', 'get', 'shortened', 'time', 'line', 'can', 'then', 'enjoy', 'whole', 'story', 'Enjoy', 'action', 'creativity', 'kinds', 'intelligent', 'species', 'technologies', 'including', 'advanced', 'DNA', 'manipulations', 'Shadows', 'Vorlons', 'produce', 'more', 'advanced', 'human', 'brains', 'can', 'enjoy', 'human', 'relations', 'main', 'characters', 'be', 'human', 'not', 'can', 'also', 'enjoy', 'great', 'creativity', 'cosmic', 'world', 'Babylon', '5', 'five', 'mile', 'long', 'cosmic', 'station', 'various', 'spacecrafts', 'many', 'other', 'creations', 'including', 'course', 'most', 'obscure', 'dark', 'shadowy', 'predators', 'not', 'vampires', 'who', 'use', 'other', 'species', 'achieve', 'objectives', 'Then', 'can', 'concentrate', 'main', 'characters', 'Captain', 'Sinclair', 'not', 'last', 'much', 'more', 'first', 'season', 'fugitive', 'apparition', 'later', 'Captain', 'Sheridan', 'not', 'always', 'humane', 'man', 'authority', 'would', 'like', 'be', 'especially', 'when', 'politician', 'ambassadors', 'Mombary', 'De', 'Lenn', 'Santori', 'Lando', 'Nan', 'G-Kar', 'become', 'indispensable', 'fixtures', 'big', 'saga', 'evolution', 'funny', 'way', 'De', 'Lenn', 'wife', 'Terrian', 'President', 'Sheridan', 'when', 'head', 'Coalition', 'Lando', 'prisoner', 'shadowy', 'spider', 'slave', 'predator', 'species', 'spite', 'being', 'Emperor', 'Santori', 'Republic', 'funnier', 'transformation', 'G-Kar', 'who', 'shifts', 'real', 'stubborn', 'pain', 'ass', 'victimized', 'refugee', 'finally', 'seer', 'guru', 'prophet', 'peace', 'own', 'people', 'various', 'species', 'Doctor', 'Franklin', 'attractive', 'doubts', 'certitudes', 'be', 'servant', 'human', 'ethics', 'own', 'profession', 'generalized', 'whole', 'universe', 'Garibaldi', 'reformed', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'head', 'security', 'used', 'weapon', 'Psy', 'Corps', 'fascist', 'mental', 'police', 'Earth', 'Sheridan', 'then', 'ending', 'corporation', 'CEO', 'Mars', 'way', 'funny', 'ah', 'ah', 'humane', 'have', 'two', 'axioms', 'reveal', 'ideology', 'first', 'axiom', 'cosmos', 'many', 'intelligent', 'species', 'present', 'rather', 'recent', 'species', 'are', 'humanoids', 'way', 'Only', 'two', 'older', 'species', 'live', 'rim', 'hyperspace', 'have', 'developed', 'higher', 'level', 'intelligence', 'Shadows', 'Vorlons', 'represent', 'two', 'visions', 'cosmic', 'history', 'Shadows', 'are', 'beings', 'darkness', 'shape', 'multi-legged', 'black', 'spiders', 'believe', 'species', 'must', 'fight', 'one', 'others', 'enable', 'progress', 'natural', 'selection', 'Vorlons', 'who', 'are', 'aerial', 'beings', 'light', 'consider', 'progress', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'political', 'treatment', 'objective', 'bringing', 'various', 'species', 'together', 'course', 'nave', 'liberals', 'versus', 'neo-conservatives', 'Clinton', 'Bush', 'Primitive', 'thinking', 'second', 'characteristic', 'emerges', 'whole', 'series', 'history', 'intelligent', 'species', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'written', 'wars', 'either', 'coming', 'own', 'wickedness', 'enslavement', 'fundamentally', 'bellicose', 'incompatible', 'species', 'even', 'more', 'pessimistic', 'belief', 'nothing', 'can', 'come', 'peace', 'understanding', 'cooperation', 'vision', 'real', 'collective', 'future', 'peace', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'peace', 'one', 'feels', 'cultivates', 'one', 'own', 'mind', 'middle', 'deeply', 'disrupted', 'aggressive', 'world', 'Peace', 'one', 'mind', 'middle', 'suicide', 'bombing', 'attack', 'apparently', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'own', 'mind', 'worst', 'part', 'saga', 'Terrian', 'humans', 'cut', 'particularly', 'vicious', 'hypocritical', 'role', 'deeply', 'grotesque', 'warmongering', 'discourse.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Vincennes', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID', 'Boulogne', 'Billancourt']",Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series

Its not perfect, but its close.Every Sci-fi fan should have knowledge of Babalon 5, and in my opinion each one should have the complete series.

A must have.There are 2 problems that you should be aware of. The season boxes are composed of book-like disk holders which are held together with a paper binding. This binding easily wears out, and your season pack will fall apart. This isn't a huge deal since each book disk-holder is also contained in a sleeve, but just remember that the quality of the binding isn't good. 2 of my 5 season boxes have become unglued/worn out so the only thing that holds them together is the sleeve.Second, the price.

810406,A2RNU49OEH8L9W,B0001M3MXY,"Jason S. Taylor ""Marco's Realto""","[1, 1]","Two space opera's have made it into my affections in different ways. The Traveller RPG speaks to my desire for a baroque, and labyrinthine setting. Babylon 5 is detailed enough, as detailed as TV can get. But what it really speaks to is the desire for the mythic.Babylon 5 is a truce city in space, similar to Istanbul or Geneva during World War II. There multiple factions compete for power until a great danger forces them to cooperate for survival.The characters are splendid, from the regal Delenn, to the cultured and devious Lando, to the loud and obnoxious G'kar. Most of them have a touch of nobility and almost all have a dark side as well. I think Delenn was my favorite character. Outwardly she seems a fairy queen, but one can tell that she is in many ways hiding beneath the mask of Duty and Honor. She has an intense desire for romance but her desire to do her job well keeps that in check. She has a mystical and charismatic air to her and is something of a Space Joan of Arc. Lennier was also well done; a meek servant trying to live up to the demands of an honor culture.The human characters are not so striking but they are good enough. Marcus Cole was the best of the humans.As for the villains, the Shadows were the creepiest alien race ever to enter tv sci-fi. The Vorlons give their own special chill by their pretended benevolence.  Mr Morden is a character one loves to hate.The concept, of writing a long serial epic for tv was a good one and the advent of DVDs made it work better. Korean TV had several historical epics. Babylon 5 takes this concept into the Space Opera genre. It has a mythic style of cosmic struggle tied in with ominous prophecy and foreboding. It is not so much SCIENCE fiction; science plays a minor part in it. It is epic that happens to take place in space. This was tried by star wars but star wars never quite got it right, Babylon 5 did.It's biggest weakness was the Deu ex Machina that solved the Shadow War. Of course it is hard to defeat ""gods""(or Sufficiently Advanced Aliens) without a ""machine of the gods"" but it was rather a disappointment.

810412,A93EK7GO0AX78,B0001M3MXY,Kevin,"[0, 0]","I just finished the fifth season last night. The characters were wonderful and the show was well written. Many of the characters grew and changed over time both in themselves and their relationship with others. In addition, there was plenty to show what real life might be like even in the fantastic world of Babylon 5. The aliens looked so different but within these great differences we found similarities to ourselves especially in the struggle to see beyond ourselves to what's best for all. So within the scripts we were not only entertained, we were also shown the best and worst of man, with hopes that we could emulate the one and avoid the other. I do believe that once the Vorlons and the Shadows left that some of the mystery and tension was gone, but the show remained solid and well presented throughout the five year run, and I loved that it actual came to a end that satisfied.I loved the show and began to wonder where it placed on my all-time list of favorites. Looking at my DVD shelf I see one of the grand parents of modern sci-fi shows, the original Star Trek. The sets were simple but the stories were great and the iconic characters resonated with a whole generation of fans, leaving a permanent mark still fondly remember today. Next to that I see Firefly which though it died young showed great promise and ended with many untapped possibilities for story lines. But even in its short life span expressed a perfect blend of adventure, drama, humor, and tension. Then add great characters and a reluctant hero and you have the beginnings of a masterpiece. Next to that I see Farscape, which is on my list partially because it surprised me by showing I could actual bond with characters that were played by puppets. But mostly because the main character came from earth during a time near my own which made the show feel like I had been pulled into a very alien environment which I needed to make sense of to stay alive. Finally, I see X-files (the mythology) which is a darker, more dramatic presentation of a conspiracy that threatens everyone, but remains hidden from all but the one that wants to believe and his loyal partner. The stories definitely create emotions, but what makes this stand out to me is the connection between the characters. The main characters of this show are connected way beyond being partners but different then being lovers. Their relationship throughout the show is mesmerizing, unequaled in any other sci-fi show I know, and maybe in any show.So with these as the heights of my sci-fi show experience where does Babylon 5 rise? Pretty near the top. To be fair I need to wait to let it settle into position since several of these other shows I watched a while ago and Babylon 5 I just finished, but I think it is safe to say that if not the top of my list it will comfortably fit somewhere in the top five, and doesn't that somehow seem appropriate.",5,One of the best,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",2010,2904,"['just', 'finished', 'fifth', 'season', 'last', 'night', 'characters', 'were', 'wonderful', 'show', 'was', 'well', 'written', 'Many', 'characters', 'grew', 'changed', 'time', 'relationship', 'others', 'addition', 'was', 'plenty', 'show', 'what', 'real', 'life', 'might', 'be', 'even', 'fantastic', 'world', 'Babylon', '5', 'aliens', 'looked', 'so', 'different', 'great', 'differences', 'found', 'similarities', 'ourselves', 'especially', 'struggle', 'see', 'what', 'best', 'So', 'scripts', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'entertained', 'were', 'also', 'shown', 'best', 'worst', 'man', 'hopes', 'could', 'emulate', 'one', 'avoid', 'other', 'do', 'believe', 'once', 'Vorlons', 'Shadows', 'left', 'mystery', 'tension', 'was', 'gone', 'show', 'remained', 'solid', 'well', 'presented', 'five', 'year', 'run', 'loved', 'actual', 'came', 'end', 'loved', 'show', 'began', 'wonder', 'where', 'placed', 'all-time', 'list', 'favorites', 'Looking', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'see', 'one', 'grand', 'parents', 'modern', 'sci-fi', 'shows', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'sets', 'were', 'simple', 'stories', 'were', 'great', 'iconic', 'characters', 'resonated', 'whole', 'generation', 'fans', 'leaving', 'permanent', 'mark', 'still', 'fondly', 'remember', 'today', 'Next', 'see', 'Firefly', 'died', 'young', 'showed', 'great', 'promise', 'ended', 'many', 'untapped', 'possibilities', 'story', 'lines', 'even', 'short', 'life', 'span', 'expressed', 'perfect', 'blend', 'adventure', 'drama', 'humor', 'tension', 'Then', 'great', 'characters', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'have', 'beginnings', 'masterpiece', 'Next', 'see', 'Farscape', 'list', 'partially', 'surprised', 'showing', 'could', 'actual', 'bond', 'characters', 'were', 'played', 'puppets', 'mostly', 'main', 'character', 'came', 'earth', 'time', 'own', 'made', 'show', 'feel', 'had', 'been', 'pulled', 'very', 'alien', 'environment', 'needed', 'make', 'sense', 'stay', 'alive', 'Finally', 'see', 'X-files', 'mythology', 'darker', 'more', 'dramatic', 'presentation', 'conspiracy', 'everyone', 'hidden', 'one', 'believe', 'loyal', 'partner', 'stories', 'definitely', 'create', 'emotions', 'what', 'stand', 'connection', 'characters', 'main', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'connected', 'way', 'being', 'partners', 'different', 'then', 'being', 'lovers', 'relationship', 'show', 'mesmerizing', 'unequaled', 'other', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'know', 'maybe', 'show.So', 'heights', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'experience', 'where', 'Babylon', '5', 'rise', 'Pretty', 'top', 'be', 'fair', 'need', 'wait', 'let', 'settle', 'position', 'several', 'other', 'shows', 'watched', 'while', 'ago', 'Babylon', '5', 'just', 'finished', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'not', 'top', 'list', 'will', 'comfortably', 'fit', 'somewhere', 'top', 'five', ""n't"", 'that', 'somehow', 'seem', 'appropriate']",Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series
810413,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,B0001M3MXY,K. Gordon,"[3, 3]","Fascinating, sometimes maddening mix of wonderful and silly,intelligent and dumb, insightful and obvious.At it's best it's the 'Wire' of science fiction, challenging'Battlestar Galactica' for intelligence and emotional depth. At it'sworst, it's like an OK episode of 'Lost in Space'.Generally far more intelligent than most TV sci-fi (or recent sci-fifilms for that matter), with stories based more on ideas than laserbattles. In that, it's a little reminiscent of the original 'Star Trek'series.The most interesting thing; this was an early case of a series having apre-planned multi-year arc, so throughout there are sometimes intentionallyconfusing or mysterious details that return to be finally explained ashaving great importance a season or two or three later.On the other hand, because this preceded the acceptance of truly serial cable shows,each episode is more self contained than more recent shows in a sometimes annoyinglyneat way.The show is also full of allusions; Shakespeare, the Bible, Buddhism,King Arthur, the Koran. Certainly the writing is grounded in prettyheady stuff. Of course, sometimes it's dealt with in a pretty heavyhanded way.The setting is a space station that's sort of an intergalactic UnitedNations. In season 1, some of the acting is so stiff, that it bringsthe series down. Also, the effects, production design, etc. all reflecta budget that's clearly way too low, giving it all an amateurish air.None-the-less, I found myself caught up in a number of the episodes,both emotionally and intellectually. One even brought tears to my eyes.And the layering in of deep mysteries to be only slowly solved gives it asense of deeper meaning and arc.Season 2 brought in some stronger cast, and somewhat better effects.The stories in season 2 continued to be a mix, mostly quite good, a fewgreat, and some subplots that were to be honest, dopey. But overall itremained pretty riveting, with lots of interesting allusions to historyand philosophy.  And it was great to see characters that seriouslyevolve as the show goes on.Season 3 was a roller coaster of good and bad episodes, with the best--suddenly making sense of obscure things from season 1 -- simplybrilliant, and other episodes just acting as filler.  And that may bethe series' biggest problem. If this show could have been 12 episodesa year instead of 22, as is the case with most current serialized series,there would be a lot fewer episodes that felt lackingin substance, as if the show were just marking time.Season 4 pulled off the neat trick of having the series feel like itanswered it's whole core question that gave it a reason for being, onlyto replace it with new story lines just as rich and strong. Again, itwas episode to episode how interesting and germane the stories were.One running problem of the series, the villains tended to be a little'Snidely Whiplash', complete with black costumes and deep scary voices.It got a little better as the series went along, but I wish the 'badguys' were a little less cartoony.Season 5 also bumps up and down, but in the end I was quite moved by itall, and will miss this series, with it's willingness to allow tragedyto befall characters we like, and a sense of the complexities ofpolitics and life.I wish it was even more consistently great, but - in the end - it wasmore than good enough.P.S. To echo what others have written here, be careful with the specialfeatures.

The year is 2258, ten years after the Earth-Minbari War, and representatives from the five major space-faring races, the Centauri, Humans, Minbari, Narns, and the Vorlons, as well as numerous minor races have all gathered at B5 in a last effort at maintaining galactic peace.

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.In a nutshell, the show's strong points have to be:1) The OUTSTANDING plot and subplots that keep getting better and better!2) The GREAT character development, and3) The wonderful feeling of being ADDICTED to the show and wanting more!Hopefully more novels will be written and more shows/episodes will be filmed based on the B5 universe.

Most other shows make the future look comfortable and super high tech. Babylon 5 looked more believable. The characters were not genius perfect people. The humans and aliens alike made mistakes.Babylon 5 was a brilliant novel for TV with a beginning, a middle, and an end before the first episode was ever aired.  This gave the series it's direction and strength. Every question was always answered with detail.  Many of the characters were little known actors that you grew to know and either love or love to hate. But they all became memorable for life.  Londo is a good example of this. He was just an alien ambassador in the beginning. You couldn't help but like the guy, even when he showed us his darkest side. Delen and Sheridan showed us that we really can all get along if we try. And the CGI special effects were stunning and realistic.When Amazon cut the price in half for the complete series, I couldn't resist getting it. Being able to watch the entire series back to back without interruption gave me a new insight to the series. I feel I got more depth from the story and enjoyed it like I was seeing it for the first time, even though I had seen every episode many times in reruns on TV. I also own the 5 B5 movie set and the Ranger and Lost episodes. If you love Sci-Fi, you will be thrilled beyond your imagination with the entire Babylon 5 saga.

Located deep in neutral territory, it is designed to prevent intergalactic war by providing a place where peace can be worked out between the races. Run by Earth, it was built with help from the Minbari after our war with them when we were almost wiped out. Since it is also a trade station, it attracts aliens of all kinds on a daily basis.Unfortunately, it also attracts trouble. There are raiders in the area, the Narn and Centauri have at best a fragile peace, and someone is always trying to smuggle something on board. Even worse, an ancient enemy is rebuilding forces, and the effects of this will reach all the way back to Earth.Babylon 5 is still unique in television. It set out to tell a single story that had been mapped out beforehand over five years. Now you can own the entire story on DVD, minus a few movies and the spin off series.  Season 1 is the most uneven and hardest to get into, but the beginnings of the story are there, and it lays the background on the races and cultures we will be dealing with over the course of the show. Season 2 brings a new captain and a storyline that is gaining speed, season 3 brings surprises and increasing tension, and season 4 is full steam ahead as most of the plot lines are resolved.  Season 5 was a last minute reprieve, so it starts slow since it has little previous story to immediately resolve like the previous years have.  By the half way point, however, you are once again hooked.  If you stick with season 1, you will get hooked and need to watch all five seasons to find out how the story ends.  I certainly did, and I continue to watch.  It's one of my favorite TV shows of all time.Of course, if you are looking at this page, odds are you are already a fan and looking for information on the sets. The picture, presented in widescreen, is hit and miss, with some dust popping up occasionally. It is clear and sharp most of the time, however. Sound is presented in full surround and has never sounded better. Each set contains two audio commentaries by series creator J. Michael Straczynski and a season intro by cast and crew. They also have some behind the scenes documentaries and encyclopedia entries introducing you to the world of Babylon 5. All the sets but season 1 have one audio commentary each by various cast members and great blooper reels hidden in the data files area as Easter eggs.Whether you buy the seasons bundled like this or individually, don't miss your chance to own this fantastic TV series.  Bought here, all you'll be missing are the original pilot (""The Gathering""), the later made for TV movies, and the spin off series Crusade.",5,The Entire Series on DVD,1081209600,"04 6, 2004",2004,2673,"['Babylon', '5', 'five', 'mile', 'long', 'space', 'station', 'Located', 'deep', 'neutral', 'territory', 'designed', 'prevent', 'intergalactic', 'war', 'providing', 'place', 'where', 'peace', 'can', 'be', 'worked', 'out', 'races', 'Run', 'Earth', 'was', 'built', 'help', 'Minbari', 'war', 'when', 'were', 'almost', 'wiped', 'out', 'also', 'trade', 'station', 'aliens', 'kinds', 'daily', 'basis.Unfortunately', 'also', 'trouble', 'are', 'raiders', 'area', 'Narn', 'Centauri', 'have', 'best', 'fragile', 'peace', 'someone', 'always', 'trying', 'smuggle', 'something', 'board', 'Even', 'worse', 'ancient', 'enemy', 'rebuilding', 'forces', 'effects', 'will', 'reach', 'way', 'back', 'Earth.Babylon', '5', 'still', 'unique', 'television', 'set', 'out', 'tell', 'single', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'mapped', 'out', 'beforehand', 'five', 'years', 'Now', 'can', 'own', 'entire', 'story', 'DVD', 'few', 'movies', 'spin', 'off', 'series', 'Season', '1', 'most', 'uneven', 'hardest', 'get', 'beginnings', 'story', 'are', 'there', 'background', 'races', 'will', 'be', 'dealing', 'course', 'show', 'Season', '2', 'new', 'captain', 'storyline', 'gaining', 'speed', 'season', '3', 'brings', 'surprises', 'increasing', 'tension', 'season', '4', 'full', 'steam', 'ahead', 'most', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'resolved', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'last', 'minute', 'reprieve', 'slow', 'little', 'previous', 'story', 'immediately', 'resolve', 'previous', 'years', 'have', 'half', 'way', 'point', 'however', 'are', 'once', 'again', 'hooked', 'stick', 'season', '1', 'will', 'get', 'hooked', 'need', 'watch', 'five', 'seasons', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'story', 'certainly', 'did', 'continue', 'watch', 'one', 'favorite', 'TV', 'shows', 'time.Of', 'course', 'are', 'looking', 'page', 'odds', 'are', 'are', 'already', 'fan', 'looking', 'information', 'sets', 'picture', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'hit', 'miss', 'dust', 'popping', 'up', 'occasionally', 'clear', 'sharp', 'most', 'time', 'however', 'Sound', 'presented', 'full', 'surround', 'never', 'sounded', 'better', 'set', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'series', 'creator', 'J.', 'Michael', 'Straczynski', 'season', 'intro', 'cast', 'crew', 'also', 'have', 'scenes', 'documentaries', 'encyclopedia', 'entries', 'introducing', 'world', 'Babylon', '5', 'sets', 'season', '1', 'have', 'one', 'audio', 'commentary', 'various', 'cast', 'members', 'great', 'blooper', 'reels', 'hidden', 'data', 'files', 'area', 'Easter', 'eggs.Whether', 'buy', 'seasons', 'bundled', 'individually', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'chance', 'own', 'fantastic', 'TV', 'series', 'Bought', 'here', ""'ll"", 'be', 'missing', 'are', 'original', 'pilot', 'Gathering', 'later', 'made', 'TV', 'movies', 'spin', 'off', 'series', 'Crusade']",Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series

My stepson, however, convinced me to watch a few shows in succession and I became hooked. Never has there been a show with so few stand-alone episodes. Any little detail in any show can mean a lot later. The show's nuance and subplots add to the fascination. The B5 movies and novels offer enjoyable side trips in the story. There are a few places where I would have written a line differently but who care's? B5 became a family event in our house because the show's continuity, character arcs and themes of love, sacrifice, honesty, bravery and forgiveness left us all feeling uplifted. Of particular significance to me was the way loss was portayed and dealt with. B5 will make you laugh and cry. When a show is good enough to speak to me on a spiritual level it becomes part of my collection. The CGI and sound are wonderful and trend-setting. I can't say enough about the cast! Suffice it to say that they're an easy bunch to fall in love with. B5 is a work of art from beginning to end and I would reccommend it to anyone with an open mind and well developed attention span.

The Fifth Station, the only one remained,  was built by Earth Aliance with the support of many alien races, including The Minbari Federation and The Centauri Republic.Babylon 5 was idealized to be a Diplomatic port where the discussions and agreements between the races could take place in a neutral zone.The first season opening summarizes very well the series essence: ""It was the dawn of the third age of mankind, ten years after the Earth/Minbari war. The Babylon Project was a dream given form. Its goal, to prevent another war by creating a place where humans and aliens could work out their differences peacefully. It's a port of call - home away from home for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs, and wanderers. Humans and aliens wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand tons of spinning metal, all alone in the night. It can be a dangerous place, but it's our last best hope for peace.

Every episode, no matter how episodic in style in initial viewing, fits into the larger plots of the series like a masterfully crafted novel.  The beauty: B5 watches well both ways.  Unlike Angel and other sci-operas, you can enjoy every episode no matter what order you watch them in.  But watch them carefully and with a careful eye and ear for the larger plots, and you see how wonderfully even the most obscure detail in the most episodic of episodes fits into the larger whole of the five year novel.This is definitely where B5 beats all other science fiction series!Of course to fully catch the artestry of this masterpiece, you do need to watch the entire series at least twice.  Which of course is why you want this DVD collection!  It comes to you in book format and honestly a couple of my sections with disks did get dislodged from the binding of the season binder.  However this is a minor thing; it doesn't impair you in any way from getting the disks out or from keeping them organized and in pristine condition.  In fact the packaging is the nicest of any movie or series I own--I wished they'd used the same book style on B5 Crusade!If you love a great epic, THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT.

Sheridan briefly which gives us further confirmation of the ""righteousness"" of the whole cause and of the leading characters themselves and d)you realize that big or small in the grand scheme of B-5 ops,that these guys are as every bit as important as the command staff is.These are things that are not touched upon too often in many shows today nor in the past and it is just one of the many facets of the show I admire.It is just one example of a multitude of the quality of the writing of Mr.Straczynski.Babylon 5 was certainly a big gamble and we can all be grateful that Mr.Straczynski and friends had the persistence and guts to push as hard as they could to get this series not only put on the air but to find an audience,maintain the high quality it did and endure for five seasons.And as you breeze through the special features on these discs you realize just how fragile its' hold on being aired at all was.And speaking of special features these discs contain many such items throughout each season.There are many looks at the series from its' prop department to its' creation of music.Seasons four and five contain some gag reels which I found to be really welcome additions.It is just too bad reels for the previous seasons could not have been included.Also there are just too few interviews with the cast members;most are just short question/responses on a few of the featurettes(which are far too short in length in and of themselves).I would have liked more lengthy one on ones.Barring these ""issues"" I still have to rate this series as high as I do.The quality of work that these seasons embody demand no less.Mr.Straczynski has said on more than one occasion that while at a speaking engagement at the illustrious M.I.T. that some there considered B-5 along with ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""Star Trek""(both the original series) to be the best Sci-Fi series ever put on TV.A high honour indeed.All broke new ground in their day and all still stand the test of time in writing and originality.Another side angle I always get a kick out of(when viewing the series) is the connection of the shows' actors and the writing(in jokes),to past shows like Star Trek,The Prisoner,Nightmare on Elm Street,among others, along with the original actors from these same shows/movies.I always go back and find more that I have previously missed.A pleasant little diversion you might want to try.In conclusion I highly recommend this series to everyone,but I know it will find a special place in the hearts of fans of good Sci-Fi.The series was intelligently written(MS)and ably executed by the marvellous acting staff.This series(the cake)coupled with ""Babylon-5-The Movie Collection""(the icing-see my review of that) is all you'll ever need to appreciate

810434,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0001M3MXY,Robert Moore,"[4, 5]","Getting into the BABYLON 5 universe can be confusing for newcomers.  To see everything you really need the DVDs in this box as well as all of the individual B5 movies and the single-season series CRUSADE.  I'm going to give a simplified chronology.  You can make it even more precise by putting one movie in between two episodes of a single season, but I don't think you gain too much by doing that.  Except for THE GATHERING and A CALL TO ARMS, none of the movies rigidly require to be viewed at a particular point.First watch BABYLON 5: THE GATHERING from this boxed set.  To be blunt, it is not very good at all.  It is basically a pilot and not an especially compelling one.  We meet some -- but by no means all -- of the important characters of forthcoming seasons, and get a taste of the B5 universe, but this is just a dull, chatty, uninteresting debut.  And the make up for G'Kar looked like it was in planning stages!  Very, very different from how he looked on the subsequent series.Next, watch Seasons One through Four of BABYLON 5 the series.  The first season is slightly more interesting than the pilot, but not by much.  Season Two gets slightly more interesting, especially near the end of the season when the Shadows plot really kicks into gear.  From this point to the end of Season Four B5 is incredibly compelling.  Just be patient watching the first two seasons.  You'll start getting hints in Season Two of how good it will eventually get, but there will still be plenty of dullish episodes instead.  The series is not terribly balanced because the network changed its plans a couple of times, first telling Straczynski that the series was going to wrap up at the end of Season Four and then, after he had collapsed two season's worth of stories into one, telling him that the show would be renewed for one more season.  So much for planning.Next, before watching Season Five, watch another movie in this set, IN THE BEGINNING.  This is far and away the best of the B5 movies and is fully as good and as entertaining as Seasons Three and Four.  It goes back before the beginning of the series, giving the details of the Minbari was.  But the narrative assumes you've seen the first four seasons.Next, watch Season Five of BABYLON 5.  Because he really had a different story arc planned for Season Five one had to be created pretty quickly.  The whole telepath arc simply never caught fire and it does not represent the best of B5.  The last third of the season focuses on the decline and fall of Centauri Prime and this is B5 at its best.  There are a string of very, very good episodes as well as a very beautiful series finale.  Mention must also be made of a lovely episode in the first half of the season written by the great Neil Gaiman.Season Five was actually broadcast in split seasons and a couple of the movies -- THIRDSPACE and RIVER OF SOULS -- were broadcast before the series actually finished.  Your call.  Neither is all that great and neither really requires to be seen at a certain point.The next movie, however, BABYLON 5: A CALL TO ARMS, should be viewed after the end of the series and the previously mentioned movies, and before the series CRUSADE.  This episode features Bruce Boxleitner very prominently as Sheridan and is probably his last great hurrah in the series.  The movie introduces the new and highly advanced space ship Excalibur and deals with a Drakh attack on earth, infecting it with a slow-acting virus that will kill all life on earth if a cure is not found (but since B5 the TV series gave us multiple glimpses into the future, we know that doesn't happen).  This required the need for a search for a cure for the virus, a search that was continued on the quickly cancelled CRUSADE.  The show never really got off the ground, but it had some interesting characters (especially Galen, played by Peter Woodward, who also appeared in the films A CALL TO ARMS and LOST TALES).  I do recommend that fans of B5 see CRUSADE.The next movie was THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS: TO LIVE AND DIE IN STARLIGHT.  Horrible.  This is the worst of all the B5 movies, the worst thing ever done in the entire run of the show.  I honestly don't even recommend this for fans of the show.  The most I can say in support of it is that it is one's last chance to see Andreas Katsulas as G'Kar.  He died a couple of years later of lung cancer.Last, and not quite least, there is 2007's THE LOST TALES.  It is definitely not as bad as THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS, but not as good as IN THE BEGINNING.  My reaction was that it was nice to see some familiar characters again (mainly just Tracy Scoggins's Captain Lochley, Bruce Boxleitner's Sheridan, and Peter Woodward's Galen).  But definitely not B5 at its best.  Most fans describe it as ""chatty.""  There are entire scenes devoted to nothing but talk, and not terribly good talk at that.A lot to see.  For me the heart consists of the end of Season Two, all of Seasons Three and Four, the movie IN THE BEGINNING, and the last third of Season Five.  My advice to anyone newly approaching B5 is to stick it out through it all.  Much of it is dull, some of it even downright bad, but the best is very good indeed.  If you are patient, you will find your patience rewarded.",4,"An uneven series that at its best is very, very good indeed",1205280000,"03 12, 2008",2008,5251,"['Getting', 'BABYLON', '5', 'universe',

810435,A158U96GCWKBJJ,B0001M3MXY,Robin L. McLaughlin,"[7, 14]","I just recently acquired this set of all five seasons of Babylon 5. In my opinion, that's the only way to do it. Because of how the show was designed, with story arcs lasting five years, you need to have the whole thing so that once you get started you can go for the ride right till the end. Because the show really is a ride!But first the bad stuff. There are a LOT of truly awful things about this show. Things that I don't normally even notice in movies or TV shows stuck out like sore thumbs to me in this production. Horrible makeup, like red circles with noticeable lines around eyes to indicate illness and other things of the sort that just pop right off the screen and scream, ""I don't know how to do makeup!"" Some of the set dressings made me think, ""What in hell were they thinking?!"" Most of the fight scenes with people were very poorly choreographed. I even noticed poor direction of extras! Extras shouldn't even be noticed. Commander Sinclair in the first season is also really hard to stomach with such poor acting.I mostly am mentioning the above to put everything in perspective. Babylon 5 had a lot of technical flaws. And people who are teetering trying to decide if they should invest, especially if they are like me and only caught part of the show when it ran on TV, need to have honest reviews to read so they know what they are getting.The special effects are also hard to take at times. The guns they used had atrocious wave ripples that didn't look at all realistic and most of the space scenes are obviously computer generated. On the other hand, the show did take good advantage of the emergent CGI available at the time and it couldn't really have been done properly without going in that direction, so in my mind, that's a highly forgiveable flaw.My last negative comment is about the packaging. It was horrible. I've never purchased a set so poorly put together. The plastic ""pages"" fall out of their container and many of the disks came loose during shipping. Two of them were scratched because of this, which interfered with playback and was quite frustrating. But it's too difficult to return them so I lived with it.So with all that, why in heck would I recommend people buy the entire series? Because, aside from a few stand alone episodes that were real duds, the story of Babylon 5 is extremely compelling. What the show lacked in technical categories it more than made up for in storytelling and charactarization. I stayed up much later than I intended several nights because I had to watch ""just one more episode"" to see what would happen.The idea of doing a TV series that was designed more as an extended novel was a hard sell, but Babylon 5 demonstrates that when done right, it's a brilliant one. One of my favorite things about the show is how little things mentioned in earlier episodes re-emerge later on, sometimes as much as a year or two later. These little mystery nuggets are relatively unique to Babylon 5 and really help to propell the stories along and make things interesting in a many-layered manner. I also liked how there were about 4-5 main stories that played out during the series.The other thing that Babylon 5 did extremely well was portray unique and distinctive races and characters. The writer created them and then a cast of fabulous actors breathed life into them. What was even better was that the characters were very complex. The good guys were sometimes bad and the bad guys were sometimes good and sometimes they traded places completely. Some of the characters can't really be pegged as either, and often the viewer is left in a moral quandry about what they think of the decisions the characters have made. Such multi-dimensional characters and situations are a rarity in television. Not to mention that Morden has to be one of the most smug and creepy evil guys to ever appear on either the small or large screen. At times the events and the acting were so intense or poignant that it brought tears to my eyes.So if you are interested in great science fiction storytelling and complex characters, and can overlook poor production values, then Babylon 5 is for you. And if Babylon 5 is for you, then you need to buy all 5 seasons at once so you can strap in for the entire rollercoaster ride.My last comment is on the five Babylon 5 movies. If you really want the full set, then they are a nice add-on and I appreciate the reviewer who posted the suggested viewing order. I found it extremely helpful. But I felt the movies were not at all needed in order to make the most of the series itself. (And in fact, the first movie was very poorly done. So if you see it first, don't let it turn you off because the best is yet to come!)",4,The Good and The Bad of Babylon 5,1172793600,"03 2, 2007",2007,4709,"['just', 'recently', 'acquired', 'set',

It certainly was, and even by today's standards which, in my opinion, are far lower than they used to be the show still stands as a towering champion of story telling.  The characters are developed like in a well written novel.  The story unfolds in a masterpiece of suspense and foreshadowing.  The philosophical points are well made, and the unique respect the show gives to religion in general and the concept of individual belief is unsurpassed in science fiction.  The sub plots are a perfect fit.  The side stories are a perfect fit.  The entire series is a perfect fit.  Admittedly, the series starts off with some episodes that are not to the quality level that the show obtains.  However, even the ""stinkers"" are watchable and fun.  Every episode contributes to the overall story arc.  By the time the series got to season 2-4, it managed to produce some of the finest stories ever developed in a TV series.  The whole plot proceeds at a level of quality that is rarely seen.  However, the show drops off a bit in quality in season 5 but still maintains an excellence that surpasses all of it contemporaries and 99% of the shows that exist today.

Mainly because the show was not written by J. Michael Straczynski (series creator) but by outside help. Result: Lousy B-movie scripts.  Only 5-6 episodes are truly good.But then Seasons 2-5 arrive, and the series truly shines.  This is the CORE of the Babylon 5 story.  J.Michael Straczynski took the reins and wrote ~95% of the show.  AND IT SHOWS.  Seasons 2-5 start with battles, end with battles, and have plenty of drama in the middle.  A new race called ""The Shadows"" starts pulling strings, manipulating the characters, and ultimately spinning off a war.  And just when you think all is dark and dreary and depressing... all hell turns loose!  The drama just builds and builds and builds.And then we have... THE GRAND FINALE TO THE NOVEL FOR TV: Set 20 years in the future, this single episode will bring tears to your eyes, because it shows the death of the hero: President Sheridan.  As series creator J.Michael Straczynski wrote:""The sad truth is that we die. That is not a happy ending, not a sad ending, simply a fact. The question is what we accomplish during the days and months and years preceding; do we leave the world a better place or a worse place? If we have left the world around us a better place, as these characters did, then it's a happy ending. - - - - - Ultimately, for me, the end of B5 is neither a sad ending nor a happy ending; I'd say it was a graceful ending, a dignified ending, an ending that said individuals can effect profound change, if they are willing to put their own lives and happiness on the line; not happy, not sad, but a testament to the idea that you have used your time here well.""""What interests me, what I wanted to do with making this show, was in large measure to examine the issues and emotions and events that precede a war... the effects of the war itself... and the aftermath of the war.

Simply the best science fiction series of its time if not the best SF series of all time. Special effects may be getting better, but not acting. B5 had superb acting, three-dimensional characters, intricate plots, and surprises galore.  You really got to love some of these characters and what they believed in.  Yes, it's space opera, but it was also great science fiction in its own right.  Why buy the DVDs?  I have watched this series multiple times, in sequence, and you pick up plot details that you miss the first time around.  This is truly a very rich and textured series.  If you have never watched the full series, please get this set and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.",5,One of the best SF series on TV,1334102400,"04 11, 2012",2012,792,"['Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'said', 'better', 'am', 'writing', 'brief', 'review', 'can', 'add', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'Simply', 'best', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'time', 'not', 'best', 'SF', 'series', 'time', 'Special', 'effects', 'may', 'be', 'getting', 'better', 'not', 'acting', 'B5', 'had', 'superb', 'acting', 'three-dimensional', 'characters', 'intricate', 'plots', 'surprises', 'galore', 'really', 'got', 'love', 'characters', 'what', 'believed', 'Yes', 'space', 'opera', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'science', 'fiction', 'own', 'right', 'Why', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'have', 'watched', 'series', 'multiple', 'times', 'sequence', 'pick', 'up', 'plot', 'details', 'miss', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'truly', 'very', 'rich', 'textured', 'series', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'full', 'series', 'please', 'get', 'set', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'have']",Babylon 5: The Complete Television Series
810447,AFZNJHDGE0DUJ,B0001M3MXY,Zadius Sky,"[1, 1]","I've purchased the seasons elsewhere, over time, and I wanted to express my admiration and respect for the show here. To be fair, I am not a fanatic, but a sincere admirer.When I first saw ""Babylon 5"" in the 90s, I was a kid and never really follow it. I've enjoyed a few episodes here and there, but then, while in college of early 2000s, I watched the re-runs, starting from the beginning to the end, and I am going, ""wow."" The show felt like a combination of science fiction and politics in the future along with religious/spiritual subtexts, and it became one of my favorite shows.This show is set between the years 2258 and 2262 when Earth becomes a unifying ""Earthgov"" along with the colonies within the solar system, which makes up what's called the Earth Alliance. Since they discovered the hyperspace and met the Centauri, they became one of the dominant civilizations beyond their own civilization. Many decades later, the space station Babylon 5 was created around the year 2256, some two years before the first season (there is a pilot movie that took place about a year before:Babylon 5 - The Gathering) - the fifth number is the number of the stations, with all previous stations were either destroyed or disappeared. The new station is located in the orbit of the planet Epsilon III.The first season takes place in the year of 2258, and Jeffrey Sinclair is in charge of the station. This is the only season with him being one of the main characters on the show. This season seems to be focusing on him as he discovers his past and his disappearance at the ""Battle of the Line"" and the reason for Minbari's surrender. Other stories involved Ambassador Delenn before her transformation into a Minbari-human hybrid in order to make connection between Minbari and humans, emerging conflict between the Narn and Centauri, and the insidious activities behind the closed doors on Earth.Season Two begins the year 2059 after Sinclair been recalled to Earth for re-assignment and the infamous Captain John Sheridan has been assigned to be the military governor of Babylon 5. Sheridan is proven to be strong-willed and incorruptible. The friendship and the trust between him and his command staffs is growing, as well as his emerging relationship with newly-Minbari-human hybrid Delenn. A tension develops between the command staff and the Psi Corps. The on-going conflict between the Narn and the Centauri. An ancient race known as ""The Shadows"" is behind the many mysterious and disturbing events throughout the season and coming to the surface from their hibernation. Unaware, Centauri Ambassador Mollari enlists their aid to attack the Narn homeworld. Towards the end of the season, Pres. Clark and his administration begins to develop the characteristics of dictatorship, controlling and restricting freedom of speech.The third season starts the year 2260 and is appropriately named ""Point of No Return."" It's also the beginning of the war with the Shadows and the war with the Earth Alliance. The phrase ""Point of No Return"" refers to the martial law as declared by Pres. Clark and the B5 command staff had to make a toughest decision: an independence from Earth. The season further shows the conflict with the Shadows and the Narn-Centauri conflict. This season shows last appearance of Jeffrey Sinclair and we'd see his important role in the overall picture.The Season 4 begins the year 2261 (""No Surrender, No Retreat"") and is my favorite season. It takes place after the supposed ""death"" of Cap. Sheridan on the Shadows homeworld and his miraculous return. It is a year of wars and their ends. Not only Babylon 5 command staff is fighting the Shadows, they turn to face the Vorlons as well. Top of that, they are fighting the war with the Earth Alliance while Delenn is struggling with the sudden civil war between the Warrior and Religious castes on Minbar.This season begins the credit of each episode with several characters speaking one line at a time:""It was the year of fire...the year of destruction...the year we took back what was ours. It was the year of rebirth...the year of great sadness...the year of pain...and the year of joy. It was a new age. It was the end of history. It was the year everything changed. The year is 2261. The place: Babylon 5.""They were pretty powerful words.The last season is the year 2262 with a new commander of the station, Captain Elizabeth Lochley, while Sheridan is the new President of the Interstellar Alliance. I see this season as an ""aftermath"" of the previous season and more dealings with the main recurring characters than the new people. This season focuses on the conflict with the rogue telepaths as the station serving as a sanctuary for them. We meet the new darkness, called The Drakh, former allies of the Shadows who remained in the galaxy and working ""behind the scenes"" on Centauri Prime. The end of this season would show each of the characters' next journeys.""Sleeping in Light"" is the final episode of this season, which is one of my favorites and the most saddest.There are a lot of themes and stories that I found interesting, especially free will in regards to the Shadows and the Vorlons. Also, sacrifices, dreams, war and peace, and struggles for normalcy/peace. Not only that, I actually admired the consistency of times and events that connected together throughout the show as I felt the plots are remarkably strong and cohesive.My favorite characters are Sheridan and G'Kar. Sheridan is something of a rising star and a legend as he has what it takes to do what needs to be done. After the Earth-Minbari War, he commanded the ship ""Agamemnon"" as its captain on a number of missions over the years until he was re-assigned as a governor of Babylon 5. From that, he became the first President of the Interstellar Alliance before turning his focus to leading the Anla'Shok in his final years. I often found myself admiring him and Bruce Boxleitner did an excellent job in this portrayal. And, G'Kar is equally interesting and holds such a powerful influence. He begins as an angry warrior and later turned to being religious, from hating to befriending an enemy. Throughout the show, one can see a great deal of changes in G'Kar on the most primitive level and that is something that interested me as well the relationship between him and Londo. Andreas Katsulas did an admirably remarkable job portraying G'Kar. I was saddened to hear about his death (along with the death of Richard Biggs, who played Dr. Stephen Franklin, the death of Jeff Conaway, who played Zack Allan, and the recent death of Michael O'Hare (2012), who played Jeffrey Sinclair).Overall, I truly loved the show and the stories as I often felt that there's wisdom involved (I admit to frequently quoting G'Kar from time to time). Comparing it to other sci-fi shows, I felt this is to be one of the best shows, hands down.",5,One Of My Favorite Shows,1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,6879,"[""'ve"", 'purchased', 'seasons',
