1233905,A32T2H8150OJLU,B001RTKKRQ,ARH,"[3, 4]","This film really catches the essense of life in Japan for a newly arrived gaijin (foreigner).  I lived in the greater Tokyo area for nearly two years, and I've been in plenty of small noodle shops.  The one in this film completely catches the spirit and flavor of those places, and, at the same time the film captures the essence of the Japanese.It is extremely difficult for most foreigners to understand the mind-set of the Japanese, but the crusty, old, ramen chef protrays it extremely well.  You have to master the technical skill and the art of whatever you do if you are to be successful and find peace and inner harmony.I loved hearing the Japanese language again, and I'm glad that the decision was made to subtitle the film and have the Japanese characters speak Japanese and the American speak English.  It's been a very long time since I've heard much Japanese, and it was good to hear it again.  And, I remember what it was like when I first arrived in Japan, and could thus empathize completely with the culture shock experienced by the ramen girl.  I wish everyone could have that kind of experience.  After a while, though, even though I knew I would never be able to become totally Japanese, I knew that I could understand and feel the Japanese spirit.This film is not really about cooking ramen, it is about finding peace and balance within yourself, with others, and with the world...ramen was only the means for telling the story.It's true that people can teach each other a lot, and it's sad that often Americans think that they have the corner on the market of the best way to do things, because that's certainly not true.  But, when people give and take, the end result can be beautiful and delicious.5 stars!",5,"East meets west, and even without comprehension they reach harmony and understanding",1289001600,"11 6, 2010",2010,1732,"['film', 'really', 'essense', 'life', 'Japan', 'newly', 'arrived', 'gaijin', 'foreigner', 'lived', 'greater', 'Tokyo', 'area', 'nearly', 'two', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'plenty', 'small', 'noodle', 'shops', 'one', 'film', 'completely', 'spirit', 'flavor', 'places', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'essence', 'Japanese.It', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'most', 'foreigners', 'understand', 'mind-set', 'Japanese', 'crusty', 'old', 'ramen', 'chef', 'protrays', 'extremely', 'well', 'have', 'master', 'technical', 'skill', 'art', 'do', 'are', 'be', 'successful', 'find', 'peace', 'inner', 'harmony.I', 'loved', 'hearing', 'Japanese', 'language', 'again', ""'m"", 'glad', 'decision', 'was', 'made', 'subtitle', 'film', 'have', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'speak', 'Japanese', 'American', 'speak', 'English', 'been', 'very', 'long', 'time', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'much', 'Japanese', 'was', 'good', 'hear', 'again', 'remember', 'what', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'arrived', 'Japan', 'could', 'thus', 'empathize', 'completely', 'culture', 'shock', 'experienced', 'ramen', 'girl', 'wish', 'everyone', 'could', 'have', 'kind', 'experience', 'while', 'even', 'knew', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'become', 'totally', 'Japanese', 'knew', 'could', 'understand', 'feel', 'Japanese', 'spirit.This', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'cooking', 'ramen', 'finding', 'peace', 'balance', 'others', 'world', 'ramen', 'was', 'only', 'means', 'telling', 'story.It', 'true', 'people', 'can', 'teach', 'other', 'lot', 'sad', 'often', 'Americans', 'think', 'have', 'corner', 'market', 'best', 'way', 'do', 'things', 'certainly', 'not', 'true', 'when', 'people', 'give', 'take', 'end', 'result', 'can', 'be', 'beautiful', 'delicious.5', 'stars']",The Ramen Girl

1233915,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B001RTKKRQ,Brian E. Erland,"[2, 3]","Synopsis: What's a confused, angst ridden young woman stranded in Tokyo to do with herself? Poor Abby has just been abandoned by her boyfriend and has nowhere to turn. Now  alone in a foreign culture where she doesn't speak the language she wanders into a little ramen shop in search of a little nourishment for both body and soul. All appears lost until that first taste of ramen prepared by the abrasive chef Maezumi (Toshiyuki Nishida). Within moments everything has changed and her life's path discovered. And what is that path, ramen. Unfortunately Maezumi has no interest in training a new apprentice, specially a talkative, overzealous American girl who won't take no for an answer. Then of course the fact that neither of them speaks the same language doesn't help matters either.Will Abby's dream be fulfilled or will Maezumi eventually convince her that she's doesn't possess the inner harmony to fully comprehend the profound nature of ramen. It's a tale of east meets west, male versus female, loss and acceptance, and so much more.Critique: I was totally surprised that I liked, correction loved this film. Why you might ask? Because I am not a fan of Brittany Murphy (nothing personal Brittany). However the wonderful, unique story-line, the magical atmosphere of the ramen shop and the stellar performances of Toshiyuki and Brittany (YES, Brittany I admit it) kept me entranced from beginning to end. The film is reminiscent of another wonderful film, 'Mistress of Spices.' The similarity is found not in the story-lines but the exotic, mystical atmosphere created for the spice store and ramen shop.Definitely an enjoyable watch delivering lots of energy, strong humorous elements and a subtle mix of pathos that elevates the film to the status of something more than just a pleasant comedy.My Rating: - 4 1/2 Stars -",4,"""Teach Me Ramen"" ~ The Taste Of Inner Harmony",1253923200,"09 26, 2009",2009,1833,"['Synopsis', 'What', 'confused', 'angst', 'ridden', 'young', 'woman', 'stranded', 'Tokyo', 'do', 'Poor', 'Abby', 'just', 'been', 'abandoned', 'boyfriend', 'nowhere', 'turn', 'Now', 'alone', 'foreign', 'culture', 'where', ""n't"", 'speak', 'language', 'little', 'ramen', 'shop', 'search', 'little', 'nourishment', 'body', 'soul', 'lost', 'first', 'taste', 'ramen', 'prepared', 'abrasive', 'chef', 'Maezumi', 'Toshiyuki', 'Nishida', 'moments', 'everything', 'changed', 'life', 'path', 'discovered', 'what', 'path', 'ramen', 'Unfortunately', 'Maezumi', 'interest', 'training', 'new', 'apprentice', 'specially', 'talkative', 'overzealous', 'American', 'girl', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'answer', 'Then', 'course', 'fact', 'same', 'language', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'either.Will', 'Abby', 'dream', 'be', 'fulfilled', 'will', 'Maezumi', 'eventually', 'convince', ""n't"", 'possess', 'inner', 'harmony', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'profound', 'nature', 'ramen', 'tale', 'east', 'meets', 'west', 'male', 'versus', 'female', 'loss', 'acceptance', 'so', 'much', 'more.Critique', 'was', 'totally', 'surprised', 'liked', 'correction', 'loved', 'film', 'Why', 'might', 'ask', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'nothing', 'personal', 'Brittany', 'However', 'wonderful', 'unique', 'story-line', 'magical', 'atmosphere', 'ramen', 'shop', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Toshiyuki', 'Brittany', 'YES', 'Brittany', 'admit', 'kept', 'entranced', 'beginning', 'end', 'film', 'reminiscent', 'wonderful', 'film', ""'Mistress"", 'Spices', 'similarity', 'found', 'not', 'story-lines', 'exotic', 'mystical', 'atmosphere', 'created', 'spice', 'store', 'ramen', 'shop.Definitely', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'delivering', 'lots', 'energy', 'strong', 'humorous', 'elements', 'subtle', 'mix', 'pathos', 'film', 'status', 'something', 'more', 'just', 'pleasant', 'comedy.My', 'Rating', '4', '1/2', 'Stars']",The Ramen Girl

1233920,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B001RTKKRQ,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","[1, 1]","This wasn't a bad film & in the memory of Brittany Murphy, I wish I could give it 4 or 5 stars. However, even though it is cute, it isn't a great film.The film surrounds Abby, a flighty young girl who decides to fly to Tokyo in order to be with her boyfriend. When he dumps her a few weeks later, she's left without any direction or purpose in her life. It's then that Abby discovers a ramen shop outside of her boyfriend's apartment (which she inexplicably remains living in), & after a few meals there, decides that she's going to learn ramen. The path to learning isn't easy, as Abby will soon discover.This was a cute film & the crown jewel in this film is easily the setting. Tokyo is a beautiful city & the charm of the ramen shop shines throughout the film. Everyone in the film does their best in this film, but in the end even they can't improve what is ultimately a shallow script.If they'd spent more time building up the secondary characters & developing the romance subplot more, then I think that this would have been a better film. The movie directors try to make Abby's ramen quest the main plotline, which is important- I'm not trying to deny that at all. It's just that like a bowl of ramen- or in ANY dish, you need to pay attention to the accents of the dish. If you don't season it right or if you skip steps, the dish will end up bland & ordinary. I would have liked to see more of the secondary characters of the ramen shop, maybe even show some sort of resolution to their problems. Plus, as another reviewer stated- we never actually see Abby learn how to make ramen broth or noodles. Sure, we see her setting the ingredients in the bowl after everything is cooked, but we never see her learning how to make the noodles or brew the broth. Since it is easy to mess up something as simple as noodles (I've tried making them before, so I can vouch for this), I find it hard to believe that Abby was able to pick up on everything so immediately- ESPECIALLY since she spoke practically no Japanese.I will also add a small pet peeve of mine. Abby spends the good part of a year there, but learns very little Japanese. She appears to have learned some by the end of the film, but since the film emphasizes her NOT speaking any Japanese, it is a little surprising to see her go from non-fluent to somewhat fluent.

You don't need to have lived in Japan to understand and appreciate that their culture is not unlike this movie portrays.  The wife wanting to become close to Abbey and siding with her and the shop owner and his tough exterior, drinking habits and loathe of Abbey in the beginning shows that most older Japanese men truely do not show their emotions and are very guarded with them as well as their secrets.  Once you get to know the charactors and understand them the appreciation for this movie grows by leaps and bounds.

1233933,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B001RTKKRQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 8]","Brittany Murphy's untimely death casts a pall over this strictly by-the-numbers 2008 direct-to-DVD comedy. She exudes a certain charm in the title role, an aimless American named Abby, who attempts to master the art of ramen while stuck in Tokyo after her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her, but there is also something vaguely disorienting about her comic performance here. She isn't helped much by the pedestrian direction by Robert Allan Ackerman, best known for his TV-movie work (Life with Judy Garland - Me and My Shadows) or the derivative script by first-time screenwriter Becca Topol. Neither is able to capture the particular idiosyncrasies of the Japanese culture in a way that would make this fish-out-of-water tale work effectively (like Sofia Coppola did so well inLost in Translation). In fact, the clich&eacute;s and contrivances come fast and furious, so much so that the Tokyo setting becomes rather moot.The poorly paced storyline has Abby's sudden break-up leading her to a neighborhood ramen shop within view of her unusually large city apartment. She is treated to a bowl of ramen by the shop's curmudgeonly owner/chef Maezumi and his ever-patient wife Reiko. For reasons unexplained, Abby becomes obsessed with learning how to make the ramen even if it means an apprenticeship that amounts to slavery under Maezumi's dictatorial guidance. Predictably, it becomes a contest of wills as to whether Abby will last. The brief scenes showing the ramen preparation may remind some of Juzo Itami's 1985 cult comedy,Tampopo, and similarities are intentional. However, this film fails to make the time-staking process uniquely appetizing. A romantic subplot is introduced as a disposable diversion, but it's hamstrung by the lack of chemistry between Murphy and Sohee Park, who tepidly plays a young Japanese executive who conveniently needs to move to Shanghai for a three-year assignment. Moreover, there is one laughably bad scene with Maezumi's wizened mother in which Abby becomes mysteriously fluent in Japanese.All these episodes lead implausibly to a visit from the Master Chef, who will make the final judgment as to whether Abby is ready to succeed Maezumi as a true ramen chef. Veteran Japanese actor Toshiyuki Nishida plays Maezumi as a cross between Danny De Vito at his most anxious and a barking bulldog. Two actors from Yojiro Takita's award-winningDeparturesappear here - Kimiko Yo plays a far more traditional role this time as Reiko, and Tsutomu Yamazaki in familiarly taciturn form as the revered Grand Master. His appearance is obviously quite deliberate since he played the Shane-like figure in ""Tampopo"" a quarter century earlier. Impressive as the younger Judy Garland in Ackerman's earlier TV-movie, Tammy Blanchard appears inexplicably as a world-weary American-born bar hostess. But this is Murphy's movie all the way, and her sincere if overly angst-ridden approach seems wasted on such a vacuous story about finding one's place in life, a theme handled with far greater emotional dexterity in ""Departures"". An extended ending, seventeen deleted scenes, and the original theatrical trailer provide the extras on the 2009 DVD.",2,"Murphy's Flighty Turn Grounded by a Predictable Fish-Out-of-Water Tale Inspired by ""Tampopo""",1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,3168,"['Brittany', 'Murphy', 'untimely', 'death', 'pall', 'strictly', 'by-the-numbers', '2008', 'direct-to-DVD', 'comedy', 'certain', 'charm', 'title', 'role', 'aimless', 'American', 'named', 'Abby', 'who', 'master', 'art', 'ramen', 'stuck', 'Tokyo', 'boyfriend', 'unceremoniously', 'also', 'something', 'vaguely', 'disorienting', 'comic', 'performance', 'here', ""n't"", 'helped', 'much', 'pedestrian', 'direction', 'Robert', 'Allan', 'Ackerman', 'best', 'known', 'TV-movie', 'work', 'Life', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Me', 'My', 'Shadows', 'derivative', 'script', 'first-time', 'screenwriter', 'Becca', 'Topol', 'able', 'capture', 'particular', 'idiosyncrasies', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'way', 'would', 'make', 'fish-out-of-water', 'tale', 'work', 'effectively', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'inLost', 'Translation', 'fact', 'clich', 'eacute', 'come', 'fast', 'furious', 'so', 'much', 'Tokyo', 'setting', 'rather', 'moot.The', 'poorly', 'paced', 'storyline', 'Abby', 'sudden', 'break-up', 'leading', 'neighborhood', 'ramen', 'shop', 'view', 'unusually', 'large', 'city', 'apartment', 'treated', 'bowl', 'ramen', 'shop', 'curmudgeonly', 'owner/chef', 'Maezumi', 'ever-patient', 'wife', 'Reiko', 'reasons', 'unexplained', 'Abby', 'obsessed', 'learning', 'how', 'make', 'ramen', 'even', 'apprenticeship', 'slavery', 'Maezumi', 'dictatorial', 'guidance', 'Predictably', 'contest', 'wills', 'Abby', 'will', 'last', 'brief', 'scenes', 'showing', 'ramen', 'preparation', 'may', 'remind', 'Juzo', 'Itami', '1985', 'cult', 'comedy', 'Tampopo', 'similarities', 'are', 'intentional', 'However', 'film', 'make', 'time-staking', 'process', 'uniquely', 'appetizing', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'introduced', 'disposable', 'diversion', 'hamstrung', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'Murphy', 'Sohee', 'Park', 'who', 'tepidly', 'young', 'Japanese', 'executive', 'who', 'conveniently', 'move', 'Shanghai', 'three-year', 'assignment', 'Moreover', 'one', 'laughably', 'bad', 'scene', 'Maezumi', 'wizened', 'mother', 'Abby', 'mysteriously', 'fluent', 'Japanese.All', 'episodes', 'lead', 'implausibly', 'visit', 'Master', 'Chef', 'who', 'will', 'make', 'final', 'judgment', 'Abby', 'ready', 'succeed', 'Maezumi', 'true', 'ramen', 'chef', 'Veteran', 'Japanese', 'actor', 'Toshiyuki', 'Nishida', 'Maezumi', 'cross', 'Danny', 'De', 'Vito', 'most', 'anxious', 'barking', 'bulldog', 'Two', 'actors', 'Yojiro', 'Takita', 'award-winningDeparturesappear', 'here', 'Kimiko', 'Yo', 'far', 'more', 'traditional', 'role', 'time', 'Reiko', 'Tsutomu', 'Yamazaki', 'familiarly', 'taciturn', 'form', 'revered', 'Grand', 'Master', 'appearance', 'obviously', 'quite', 'deliberate', 'played', 'Shane-like', 'figure', 'Tampopo', 'quarter', 'century', 'earlier', 'Impressive', 'younger', 'Judy', 'Garland', 'Ackerman', 'earlier', 'TV-movie', 'Tammy', 'Blanchard', 'inexplicably', 'world-weary', 'American-born', 'bar', 'hostess', 'Murphy', 'movie', 'way', 'sincere', 'overly', 'angst-ridden', 'approach', 'wasted', 'vacuous', 'story', 'finding', 'one', 'place', 'life', 'theme', 'handled', 'far', 'greater', 'emotional', 'dexterity', 'Departures', 'extended', 'ending', 'seventeen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'provide', 'extras', '2009', 'DVD']",The Ramen Girl

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 5]","Oh boy, am I tired of the sourpusses out there berating this wonderful film.Even the wife says ""it's stupid"", to which I always respond by reminding her that she has never had genuine Japanese ramen (a/k/a ""raumen""). She really hates it when I sink to un-critic-like levels to make my point. The point is, this film is a classic of drama and comedy. That' not easy to accomplish by anyone.This film is supposed to be Disneyesque, and a bit fun. It also seems to expect some serious thought; it accomplishes that marvelously. Briefly, Abby the Sweet (poor young Brittany) is dumped in Japan by a mountebank boyfriend, drowns her tears in the best bowl of ramen soup in the galaxy, and decides she wants to learn to make it. (Ramen soup, that is, not a galaxy, but it is close.)She hounds the ramen master until he says yes. By the way, that is some of the best comedy you'll ever see. The master calls her ""monkey brain"". Eventually they not only succeed together; he makes her his successor.Every master in the Orient must have a successor, or the master's life is meaningless. Pay heed, oh empty-headed American gaijin! In case you missed the 2-way nod, this is a scene borrowed fromKill Bill, Vols. 1 & 2, when Uma Thurman visits Sonny Chiba to learn from him. That was hilarious beyond description, pure slapstick, so THE RAMEN GIRL toned that down a bit.Every line, every action in this film MEANS something, just as every ingredient in ramen soup has meaning. Naturally Americans - even ones who've lived in Japan - don't get it. Sweat for a week just trying to get in to see a Buddhist monk and you'll know what this movie means!Don't expect a lot of dramatic stretching from Brittany Murphy beyond humorous crying jags and one of the biggest mouths I've ever seen this side of Alanis Morrisset. Do be ready to enjoy a light-hearted, brief yet fun jaunt through a corner of Japan. If you've seen the deleted scenes, thank Ramen God that they didn't make this film as dark as they had initially planned. GET IT. It's too good to pass up your collection.ADDENDA: I don't follow people's lives in the main, and I guess I missed the newscast. Brittany Murphy died in December last year (2009), apparently a suicide with pills, anaemia and pneumonia. One remaining film is due to be released this summer, her last screen appearance. When I first learned about all this, I couldn't help but compare it to the tragic loss of Heath Ledger. What is happening, what is going wrong? I guess it's drugs, but how can I know. When you watch this film, perhaps you could observe a moment of ... well, something ... for Brittany.A fan posted this to me, well worth quoting in full: ""Her sudden weight loss a year or two before she died suggested she might be anorexic, though we'll never know--she certainly had the look. Yes, coroner ruled it an accident, but something happened to destroy her health.""Let us chorus together a sad ""Amen"" to that.",4,It's all in the pig bones,1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,2937,"['Oh', 'boy', 'am', 'tired', 'sourpusses', 'there', 'berating', 'wonderful', 'wife', 'stupid', 'always', 'respond', 'reminding', 'never', 'had', 'genuine', 'Japanese', 'ramen', 'raumen', 'really', 'when', 'sink', 'un-critic-like', 'levels', 'make', 'point', 'point', 'film', 'classic', 'drama', 'comedy', 'not', 'easy', 'accomplish', 'anyone.This', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'Disneyesque', 'bit', 'fun', 'also', 'expect', 'serious', 'thought', 'marvelously', 'Briefly', 'Abby', 'Sweet', 'poor', 'young', 'Brittany', 'dumped', 'Japan', 'mountebank', 'boyfriend', 'tears', 'best', 'bowl', 'ramen', 'soup', 'galaxy', 'learn', 'make', 'Ramen', 'soup', 'not', 'galaxy', 'close', 'ramen', 'master', 'yes', 'way', 'best', 'comedy', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'master', 'monkey', 'brain', 'Eventually', 'not', 'only', 'succeed', 'together', 'successor.Every', 'master', 'Orient', 'must', 'have', 'successor', 'master', 'life', 'meaningless', 'Pay', 'heed', 'oh', 'empty-headed', 'American', 'gaijin', 'case', 'missed', '2-way', 'nod', 'scene', 'borrowed', 'fromKill', 'Bill', 'Vols', '1', '2', 'when', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'Sonny', 'Chiba', 'learn', 'was', 'hilarious', 'description', 'pure', 'slapstick', 'THE', 'RAMEN', 'GIRL', 'toned', 'down', 'bit.Every', 'line', 'action', 'film', 'MEANS', 'something', 'just', 'ingredient', 'ramen', 'soup', 'meaning', 'Naturally', 'Americans', 'even', 'ones', 'who', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'Japan', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Sweat', 'week', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'see', 'Buddhist', 'monk', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'lot', 'dramatic', 'stretching', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'humorous', 'crying', 'jags', 'one', 'biggest', 'mouths', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'side', 'Alanis', 'Morrisset', 'Do', 'be', 'ready', 'enjoy', 'light-hearted', 'brief', 'yet', 'fun', 'jaunt', 'corner', 'Japan', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'thank', 'Ramen', 'God', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'as', 'dark', 'had', 'initially', 'planned', 'GET', 'IT', 'too', 'good', 'pass', 'up', 'collection.ADDENDA', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'people', 'lives', 'main', 'guess', 'missed', 'newscast', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'died', 'December', 'last', 'year', '2009', 'apparently', 'suicide', 'pills', 'anaemia', 'pneumonia', 'One', 'remaining', 'film', 'due', 'be', 'released', 'summer', 'last', 'screen', 'appearance', 'When', 'first', 'learned', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', 'tragic', 'loss', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'What', 'happening', 'what', 'going', 'wrong', 'guess', 'drugs', 'how', 'can', 'know', 'When', 'watch', 'film', 'perhaps', 'could', 'observe', 'moment', 'well', 'something', 'Brittany.A', 'fan', 'posted', 'well', 'worth', 'quoting', 'full', 'sudden', 'weight', 'loss', 'year', 'two', 'died', 'suggested', 'might', 'be', 'anorexic', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'certainly', 'had', 'look', 'Yes', 'coroner', 'ruled', 'accident', 'something', 'happened', 'destroy', 'health', 'Let', 'chorus', 'together', 'sad', 'Amen']",The Ramen Girl

In this case, the finding is odd. Brittany Murphy's character finds her calling in ramen. In particular, she wants to learn how to cook the perfect bowl of Ramen. She asks a Japanese chef who speaks no English to teacher her, an American who speaks no Japanese, how to make Ramen.The movie was actually pretty funny. It includes frequent scenes of a Ramen master slapping Murphy on the head for being a bad student. It definitely works as a lighthearted date movie. However, overall it did seem a bit chopped up and hasty. It seems as if some key plot developments were skipped over or overlooked.

This was not about an American girl needing to find ""a new way of life"" because her boyfriend dumped her, nor do I believe the film was ""inspired""  by the film Tampopo, wonderful as it was.  Where Tampopo was sly, Ramen Girl is ingenuous.  Where the cook in Tampopo was motivated by economic necessity, Abby's (Brittany Murphy) attraction to the noodle shop is almost mystical (the maneki neko raises its paw to beckon her to salvation), and in her first bowl of Ramen she is saved.  From then on, her purpose is to master and dispense this cure for the soul--she is a kind girl.  Determined, too, even in the face of rejection by the crusty sansei (Toshiyuki Nishida).  She could go home--her parents offer to send her the ticket--but to what?  A new boyfriend asks her to come with him to Shanghai, and only the year before she was begging the prior boyfriend to let her come with him, but now she has her ""self"" to live up to.  Maybe her quest to make perfect Ramen is a metaphor.  I think it's a comforting little film.  Something about Brittany Murphy's face in sorrow--she really was quite remarkable.  She was one of the producers of this, too, which indicates some taste and vision.  The ambiance of the shabby shop and bleak rainy streets is artistically perfect.

If you have been to Japan and have experienced the ramen noodles, this film will make you smile all the way especially after the ramen restaurant appears. The experts know that this kind of slightly old and 'scummy' restaurants serve the best ramen! If you watchedTampopo, you must have seen how serious Japanese people are about ramen noodles, and that the whole thing about good ramen is discussed at a philosophical level!My favourite part of this film is that the role of the Ramen Master is played by a brilliant brilliant actor, Toshiyuki Nishida. He is a VERY well-known and my favourite Japanese actor, but unfortunately people outside Japan haven't had much chance to see his work, because this film is his first ever Hollywood movie appearance. His appearing in Hollywood scene was long overdue, but at last he has arrived!Brittany Murphy is lovely, too, and through learning how to make good ramen with her very tetchy Master (Nishida), she starts to see what is really important in her heart, and there is this wonderful moment of eye contact when these two stubborn guys who don't understand each other with language can exchange something in their hearts.I'm glad that this kind of film that shows an ordinary life of a working class Japanese man has been introduced in this way, because as far as I know Japan has a lot more than just gadgets, bullet trains, karaoke, ninja or samurai. Hope you'll enjoy it!Just one minor point I didn't appreciate much was the music that is played each time the ramen shop appears, because it's so Chinese! I think the idea is that this tune is used as a 'theme' of this shop, which is the central stage of the whole film, but in my view the music is slightly misleading!FYI, you might recognize the Ramem Master, Toshiyuki Nishida, from his famous role as lovely 'Pigsy' in legendaryMonkey (1979), which has had a large cult following in the UK and in Japan, and is still shown late at night sometimes in those countries.Hope this helps!

He dumps her and heads for a job in Osaka. In her lonliness, she is drawn to the neighborhood ramen shop where she finds comfort in the food and the ambient warmth of the place. The owner is a drunken tyrant who keeps begging her to get out and go home. But going home would mean utter defeat and humiliation. She decides instead that she wants to learn to cook ramen. Along the way, she meets the local Japanese customers, is befriended by some rather aimless ex-pats, and meets a lovely young Japanese man.

I wanted to give this movie 5 stars, but I see there are some plot holes in the movie, and the ending with the chef isn't my cup of tea. But, 4 stars is still pretty awesome as well. Before I actually watched the movie, I wasn't expecting much, but this movie actually surprised me at the end, so I had to give it at least 4 stars.Brittany Murphy acting was very top notch in this one. I believed that she wanted to really learn how to make ramen and be a student of old chef, Toshiyuki Nishida. She worked really hard putting up with being a student of his: cleaning the pots, the pans, and the bathroom. She had to carry and lug all that heavy stuff around. Then, for her enough, she got to try to make the ramen broth soup. This usually turns out bad and gets dumped. The first attempted wasn't even tasted and straight out dumped. lolFor the rest of the movie, we did get introduced to a few more people. There is a another American guy and girl that were in the movie, but after a few scenes we never saw the guy again with no explanation. Also, with the girl she was shown in a few more scenes, then she wasn't seen again too.What I didn't like about the movie was that old chef had to retire because he lost the bet he made with the other old chef. Then, Brittany had to go back to America because she could longer work for him. Before Brittany left, there was a scene with the people on the street lifting her up onto a platform and the old chef giving her a japanese lantern. I hated this scene because it showed that Brittany is too above her teacher now. I kept on looking at Brittany face and it looked like she was way over and done with her teacher. The teacher looked sad and about to cry. He really looked like he was reaching for her to show him some kind of respect for him helping her. This was sad I thought.What surprised me at the end of the movie, Brittany gets her Japanese boyfriend back. I was just expecting Brittany to make her ramen shop and ended like that. But, I wasn't expecting that Japanese guy to come back to her. He seemed too way Japanese to just throw down his whole life and career and go back to Brittany. Him doing that in real life wouldn't happen, but that was a great thing to see for a movie ending. 4 stars!",4,I didn't like the ending with the Chef,1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,2294,"['Spoiler', 'Alert', 'really', 'liked', 'one', 'wanted', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'see', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'movie', 'ending', 'chef', ""n't"", 'cup', 'tea', '4', 'stars', 'still', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'as', 'well', 'actually', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'movie', 'actually', 'surprised', 'end', 'had', 'give', 'least', '4', 'stars.Brittany', 'Murphy', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'top', 'notch', 'one', 'believed', 'wanted', 'really', 'learn', 'how', 'make', 'ramen', 'be', 'student', 'old', 'chef', 'Toshiyuki', 'Nishida', 'worked', 'really', 'hard', 'putting', 'up', 'being', 'student', 'cleaning', 'pots', 'pans', 'bathroom', 'had', 'carry', 'lug', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'around', 'Then', 'enough', 'got', 'try', 'make', 'ramen', 'soup', 'usually', 'out', 'bad', 'dumped', 'first', 'attempted', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'tasted', 'straight', 'out', 'dumped', 'lolFor', 'rest', 'movie', 'did', 'get', 'introduced', 'few', 'more', 'people', 'American', 'guy', 'girl', 'were', 'movie', 'few', 'scenes', 'never', 'saw', 'guy', 'again', 'explanation', 'Also', 'girl', 'was', 'shown', 'few', 'more', 'scenes', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'seen', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'old', 'chef', 'had', 'retire', 'lost', 'bet', 'made', 'other', 'old', 'chef', 'Then', 'Brittany', 'had', 'go', 'back', 'America', 'could', 'longer', 'work', 'Brittany', 'left', 'was', 'scene', 'people', 'street', 'lifting', 'up', 'platform', 'old', 'chef', 'giving', 'japanese', 'lantern', 'hated', 'scene', 'showed', 'Brittany', 'too', 'teacher', 'now', 'kept', 'looking', 'Brittany', 'face', 'looked', 'was', 'way', 'done', 'teacher', 'teacher', 'looked', 'sad', 'cry', 'really', 'looked', 'was', 'reaching', 'show', 'kind', 'respect', 'helping', 'was', 'sad', 'thought.What', 'surprised', 'end', 'movie', 'Brittany', 'Japanese', 'boyfriend', 'back', 'was', 'just', 'expecting', 'Brittany', 'make', 'ramen', 'shop', 'ended', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Japanese', 'guy', 'come', 'back', 'seemed', 'too', 'way', 'Japanese', 'just', 'throw', 'down', 'whole', 'life', 'career', 'go', 'back', 'Brittany', 'Him', 'doing', 'real', 'life', 'would', ""n't"", 'happen', 'was', 'great', 'thing', 'see', 'movie', 'ending', '4', 'stars']",The Ramen Girl

1233994,A2IMLOJ2Z2QEU2,B001RTKKRQ,Storm,"[7, 18]","I watched The Ramen Girl because Amazon recommended the movie to me based upon my various viewing history.  I saw the little video blurb on the product screen and was interested enough to borrow the title from a friend.  I'm glad I borrowed instead of bought - this movie was horrid.The only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one is the Japanese cast.  Toshiyuki Nishida gives a stellar performance as the ""grumpy old man"" stereotype while Kimiko Yo adds a nice touch of heart in playing the loving wife. Nishida did have quite a few lines in the movie which had me laughing, but unfortunately the rest of the movie was poorly written and the acting ability of the leading star left much to be desired.  Hikari Okada as the old mother was a very heartfelt touch - too bad the scene was ruined by Murphy.  Tsutomu Yamazaki's cameo as the Grand Master of ramen was a very nice nod to the Goro character of Tampopo as well.Imagine taking the base story that is Tampopo - the urge to find and make the best bowl of ramen that you can - and then dumping in a giant dose of ""Generic American Romantic comedy plot #01"".  While Tampopo made you feel for the characters and the possibility of a perfect bowl of ramen made by a chef of such skill that it made the eater find a little bit of true happiness at the end of the bowl, The Ramen Girl bludgeons you over the head with it and attempts to tell you that a bowl of ramen can make you physically cry or laugh out loud, depending on the skill of the chef.  Subtlety is obviously not in the director's (or Brittany Murphy's) reppitoire.On the foodie side of the house, I was even more disappointed.  There was no talk about the ingredients, the time or heart it took to make the perfect bowl of ramen.  The deepest that this movie got was to say ""Cook from your heart, not your head!""  While that line (or similar) work for many foodie movies, it doesn't work when it's the only piece of advice offered through the entire film.There are also 501 subplots in this movie that have zero relation or resolution to the main trunk of the story.  There's the boyfriend which disappears after the first 15min of the movie, never to be seen or heard from again.  There's the original job, which she apparently leaves with no notice - but is able to keep her apartment without getting paid for a month.  There's the hooker and the homosexual drunk - the hooker which is a sorry attempt at playing a mirroring device vehicle for Murphy's character, and the homosexual drunk which appears to serve no purpose at all except for maybe comedic interlude (which he fails at).  There's the ""rival"" ramen maker and the ramen Grand Master challenge - neither of which actually flesh out to be anything substantial, but they sure do get built up like it might be.  The two ladies who lack happiness and the love-lost boy-who-doesn't-have-a-chance-with-the-hot-American-girl.  Yes, all that is packed into the movie for no apparent rhyme or reason to most of them.  Oh, apparently the ramen chef has a son - but it's ok, everything is magically made better by the end of the movie.I can only recommend this movie if you're seriously jonesing for a fix of Japan.  This isn't a movie for a foodie nor for a serious Asian cinema fan.  This movie is the equivalent of watching the Richard Gere version of ""Shall we dance?"" and comparing it to the original Japanese version.  Except with much lower production values and acting ability.  I am being serious when I say you could have replaced Brittany Murphy's entire dialogue in this movie with her oft-repeated phrase, ""I don't understand,"" and you wouldn't have lost much at all.If you've watched this movie and you haven't seen Tampopo, go see it and you'll understand how this movie should have been made.",2,Heavy-handed attempt to Americanize Tampopo (hint: it doesn't work),1246838400,"07 6, 2009",2009,3788,"['watched', 'Ramen', 'Girl', 'Amazon', 'recommended', 'movie', 'based', 'various', 'viewing', 'history', 'saw', 'little', 'video', 'blurb', 'product', 'screen', 'was', 'interested', 'enough', 'borrow', 'title', 'friend', ""'m"", 'glad', 'borrowed', 'instead', 'bought', 'movie', 'was', 'horrid.The', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'movie', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'Japanese', 'cast', 'Toshiyuki', 'Nishida', 'stellar', 'performance', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'stereotype', 'Kimiko', 'Yo', 'nice', 'touch', 'heart', 'playing', 'loving', 'wife', 'did', 'have', 'quite', 'few', 'lines', 'movie', 'had', 'laughing', 'unfortunately', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'poorly', 'written', 'acting', 'ability', 'leading', 'star', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'Hikari', 'Okada', 'old', 'mother', 'was', 'very', 'heartfelt', 'touch', 'too', 'bad', 'scene', 'was', 'ruined', 'Murphy', 'Tsutomu', 'Yamazaki', 'cameo', 'Grand', 'Master', 'ramen', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'nod', 'Goro', 'character', 'Tampopo', 'well.Imagine', 'taking', 'base', 'story', 'Tampopo', 'urge', 'find', 'make', 'best', 'bowl', 'ramen', 'can', 'then', 'dumping', 'giant', 'dose', 'Generic', 'American', 'Romantic', 'comedy', 'plot', '01', 'Tampopo', 'made', 'feel', 'characters', 'possibility', 'perfect', 'bowl', 'ramen', 'made', 'chef', 'such', 'skill', 'made', 'eater', 'find', 'little', 'bit', 'true', 'happiness', 'end', 'bowl', 'Ramen', 'Girl', 'bludgeons', 'head', 'attempts', 'tell', 'bowl', 'ramen', 'can', 'make', 'physically', 'cry', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'depending', 'skill', 'chef', 'Subtlety', 'obviously', 'not', 'director', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'foodie', 'side', 'house', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'disappointed', 'was', 'talk', 'ingredients', 'time', 'heart', 'took', 'make', 'perfect', 'bowl', 'ramen', 'deepest', 'movie', 'got', 'was', 'say', 'Cook', 'heart', 'not', 'head', 'line', 'similar', 'work', 'many', 'foodie', 'movies', ""n't"", 'work', 'when', 'only', 'piece', 'advice', 'offered', 'entire', 'film.There', 'are', 'also', '501', 'subplots', 'movie', 'have', 'zero', 'relation', 'resolution', 'main', 'trunk', 'story', 'boyfriend', 'first', '15min', 'movie', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'heard', 'again', 'original', 'job', 'apparently', 'notice', 'able', 'keep', 'apartment', 'getting', 'paid', 'month', 'hooker', 'homosexual', 'drunk', 'hooker', 'sorry', 'attempt', 'playing', 'mirroring', 'device', 'vehicle', 'Murphy', 'character', 'homosexual', 'drunk', 'serve', 'purpose', 'maybe', 'comedic', 'interlude', 'rival', 'ramen', 'maker', 'ramen', 'Grand', 'Master', 'challenge', 'neither', 'actually', 'out', 'be', 'anything', 'substantial', 'sure', 'do', 'get', 'built', 'up', 'might', 'be', 'two', 'ladies', 'who', 'lack', 'happiness', 'love-lost', ""boy-who-doesn't-have-a-chance-with-the-hot-American-girl"", 'Yes', 'packed', 'movie', 'apparent', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'most', 'Oh', 'apparently', 'ramen', 'chef', 'son', 'ok', 'everything', 'magically', 'made', 'better', 'end', 'movie.I', 'can', 'only', 'recommend', 'movie', ""'re"", 'seriously', 'jonesing', 'fix', 'Japan', ""n't"", 'movie', 'foodie', 'serious', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'fan', 'movie', 'equivalent', 'watching', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'version', 'Shall', 'dance', 'comparing', 'original', 'Japanese', 'version', 'much', 'lower', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'ability', 'am', 'being', 'serious', 'when', 'say', 'could', 'have', 'replaced', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'entire', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'oft-repeated', 'phrase', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'lost', 'much', 'all.If', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Tampopo', 'go', 'see', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'how', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made']",The Ramen Girl

1233999,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001RTKKRQ,Tsuyoshi,"[29, 40]","My experience tells me that it is not a good sign if a film with a big-name star receives only a limited theatrical release before disappearing without a trace. The star I am talking about is NOT Brittany Murphy - though she is top-billed in ""The Ramen Girl"" - it is Japanese actor Toshiyuki Nishida. The respected veteran is famous for his hugely successful movie franchise ""Tsuribaka Nisshi,"" but perhaps some might remember him as the ""Pigsy"" of Japanese TV series ""Monkey."" Despite his name, the film never received wide theatrical release in Japan. This is quite unusual - imagine a Tom Hanks movie released only in LA and you know what I mean - and the reason is simple. ""The Ramen Girl"" is not very good.Brittany Murphy is Abby, who has followed her boyfriend Ethan (Gabriel Mann) from America. Ethan leaves her, however, and shocked Abby is attracted to the bright light nearby her apartment room. It is a small ramen shop run by a headstrong master Maezumi (Nishida), and Abby, looking for a new way of life, decides to work at the shop to learn the art of cooking. Naturally Maezumi refuses, but persistent Abby wouldn't leave and the shop master reluctantly agrees.Certainly the storyline is forced, but not without potential. I don't think stubborn master like Maezumi, who has been doing his job for more than forty years, would take Abby (or anyone else, American or not) as a pupil so easily, but Nishida is a talented actor, very good at comedy, so the film still had a chance.Alas, the director never allows him to do what he can do. Not surprisingly, grumpy Maezumi yells at Brittany Murphy's Abby, who is not a fast learner, but the film is no fun to watch as it lacks humor and pathos that this kind of story needs. This is not the wall-painting training of wise Miyagi-san in ""The Karate Kid"" which has a meaning in it. Maezumi's pointless ""training"" (like Abby scrubbing a toilet bowl) doesn't convince us.Abby's character is also a problem. The idea of a broken-hearted American woman who wants to learn ramen cooking is not very credible. Moreover, the film never gives her a real trial. It takes a lot of effort and tenacity to acquire skills of ramen cooking (or any kind of cooking for that matter), but the dialogue-ridden film never gives her a chance to show her cooking prowess. What she has to learn is explained away simply with a word ""tamashii"" or soul. And a teardrop, too.""The Ramen Girl"" is helmed by Brooklyn-born Emmy-winning director Robert Allan Ackerman, who has also directed plays in Tokyo many times. The film's screenplay is written by Becca Topol, who, according to the film's home page, spent one year in Japan while studying in college. As to the production design of the ramen shop and the owner's house, it is perfect. You can find such small ramen shops around the corner anywhere in Japan.However, the film, it seems, misses every opportunity to use their knowledge about the country and its culture. Cooking ramen plays a significant role as metaphor in the film, but in ""The Ramen Girl"" somehow you don't see the details of ramen cooking they should know. How did Abby learn the skills? How did the master teach her?There is nice supporting acting from Kimiko Yo as Maezumi's wife, and Tsutomu Yamazaki as the grand ramen master (both actors seen in ""Departures""), but the lagging pace of the film doesn't change. Subplots about the characters played by Tammy Blanchard and Sohee Park are so weak and forgettable.The film needs a more capable director and writer, who can create a cinematically dynamic narrative development, or more credible story and characters. This is s huge disappointment for me. ""The Ramen Girl"" could have been a much more engaging drama with someone else as director. Toshiyuki Nishida, one of the best actors in Japan, deserves a better film than this.By the way, there is really a ""Ramen Museum"" in Yokohama.",2,Sporadically Engaging Fish-Out-Of-Water Story That Needs a Better Director,1253232000,"09 18, 2009",2009,3892,"['experience', 'tells', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'film', 'big-name', 'star', 'only', 'limited', 'theatrical', 'release', 'disappearing', 'trace', 'star', 'am', 'talking', 'NOT', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'top-billed', 'Ramen', 'Girl', 'Japanese', 'actor', 'Toshiyuki', 'Nishida', 'respected', 'veteran', 'famous', 'hugely', 'successful', 'movie', 'franchise', 'Tsuribaka', 'Nisshi', 'perhaps', 'might', 'remember', 'Pigsy', 'Japanese', 'TV', 'series', 'Monkey', 'name', 'film', 'never', 'received', 'wide', 'theatrical', 'release', 'Japan', 'quite', 'unusual', 'imagine', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'movie', 'released', 'only', 'LA', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'reason', 'simple', 'Ramen', 'Girl', 'not', 'very', 'good.Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Abby', 'who', 'followed', 'boyfriend', 'Ethan', 'Gabriel', 'Mann', 'America', 'Ethan', 'however', 'shocked', 'Abby', 'attracted', 'bright', 'light', 'nearby', 'apartment', 'room', 'small', 'ramen', 'shop', 'run', 'headstrong', 'master', 'Maezumi', 'Nishida', 'Abby', 'looking', 'new', 'way', 'life', 'work', 'shop', 'learn', 'art', 'cooking', 'Naturally', 'Maezumi', 'persistent', 'Abby', 'would', ""n't"", 'leave', 'shop', 'master', 'reluctantly', 'agrees.Certainly', 'storyline', 'forced', 'not', 'potential', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'stubborn', 'master', 'Maezumi', 'who', 'been', 'doing', 'job', 'more', 'forty', 'years', 'would', 'take', 'Abby', 'anyone', 'else', 'American', 'not', 'pupil', 'so', 'easily', 'Nishida', 'talented', 'actor', 'very', 'good', 'comedy', 'film', 'still', 'had', 'chance.Alas', 'director', 'never', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'grumpy', 'Maezumi', 'yells', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Abby', 'who', 'not', 'fast', 'learner', 'film', 'fun', 'watch', 'humor', 'pathos', 'kind', 'story', 'needs', 'not', 'wall-painting', 'training', 'wise', 'Miyagi-san', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'meaning', 'Maezumi', 'pointless', 'training', 'Abby', 'scrubbing', 'toilet', 'bowl', ""n't"", 'convince', 'us.Abby', 'character', 'also', 'problem', 'idea', 'broken-hearted', 'American', 'woman', 'who', 'learn', 'ramen', 'cooking', 'not', 'very', 'credible', 'Moreover', 'film', 'never', 'real', 'trial', 'lot', 'effort', 'tenacity', 'acquire', 'skills', 'ramen', 'cooking', 'kind', 'cooking', 'matter', 'dialogue-ridden', 'film', 'never', 'chance', 'show', 'cooking', 'prowess', 'What', 'learn', 'explained', 'away', 'simply', 'word', 'tamashii', 'soul', 'teardrop', 'too', 'Ramen', 'Girl', 'helmed', 'Brooklyn-born', 'Emmy-winning', 'director', 'Robert', 'Allan', 'Ackerman', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'plays', 'Tokyo', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Becca', 'Topol', 'who', 'according', 'film', 'home', 'page', 'spent', 'one', 'year', 'Japan', 'studying', 'college', 'production', 'design', 'ramen', 'shop', 'owner', 'house', 'perfect', 'can', 'find', 'such', 'small', 'ramen', 'shops', 'corner', 'anywhere', 'Japan.However', 'film', 'opportunity', 'use', 'knowledge', 'country', 'culture', 'Cooking', 'ramen', 'significant', 'role', 'metaphor', 'film', 'Ramen', 'Girl', 'somehow', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'details', 'ramen', 'cooking', 'should', 'know', 'How', 'did', 'Abby', 'learn', 'skills', 'How', 'did', 'master', 'teach', 'nice', 'supporting', 'acting', 'Kimiko', 'Yo', 'Maezumi', 'wife', 'Tsutomu', 'Yamazaki', 'grand', 'ramen', 'master', 'actors', 'seen', 'Departures', 'lagging', 'pace', 'film', ""n't"", 'change', 'Subplots', 'characters', 'played', 'Tammy', 'Blanchard', 'Sohee', 'Park', 'are', 'so', 'weak', 'forgettable.The', 'film', 'more', 'capable', 'director', 'writer', 'who', 'can', 'create', 'cinematically', 'dynamic', 'narrative', 'development', 'more', 'credible', 'story', 'characters', 's', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'Ramen', 'Girl', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'engaging', 'drama', 'someone', 'else', 'director', 'Toshiyuki', 'Nishida', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'Japan', 'better', 'film', 'this.By', 'way', 'really', 'Ramen', 'Museum', 'Yokohama']",The Ramen Girl

1234003,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B001RTKKRQ,Z Hayes,"[28, 33]","The late Brittany Murphy shines in this heartwarming movie about self-discovery. Abby (Murphy) moves to Japan to be with her boyfriend but when she gets dumped, she finds herself in a fix. Unwilling to return to the States, thinking she still has a chance to make it up with her BF, Abby finds a new purpose in the ramen place across the street from her apartment. One rainy night, a despondent Abby wanders into the ramen shop after closing, and starts weeping. The chef Maezumi (Toshiyuki Nishida) and his wife are puzzled as they can't speak English and Abby can't converse in Japanese, so they offer some ramen to comfort her. It does that and more - inspired by the wonderful taste of the ramen, Abby is seized by a sudden desire to learn how to cook ramen, and like an annoying gnat, keeps harassing the chef until he finally takes her on as his apprentice - but not without giving her a really hard time (Abby's initial duties include cleaning the kitchen and the dirty toilets as well as waiting on tables).The heated exchanges between Abby and Maezumi make for great entertainment- Maezumi as played by Nishida is an irascible taskmaster, who hides a lot of pain beneath his prickly demeanor. Abby, portrayed brilliantly by Murphy, is an initially naive, lost soul trying to find a purpose in life, and struggles to adapt to a foreign environment - not speaking Japanese doesn't help either. There is also a cast of secondary characters, such as the American woman who works as a call girl/mistress, the handsome, young Japanese executive who forms a relationship with Abby, the chef's wife, and a few eccentric regulars at the ramen place. The story does not get overly sappy, and the story, though predictable, is not without a couple of twists. The story might not be original, but it certainly is well-cast and the leads make this an engaging watch. I took away one star because I felt some of the secondary characters deserved more development, e.g. the call girl/mistress who just disappears half-way through the movie. On the whole, this is an interesting, and uplifting drama about searching for one's path in life, and showcases Brittany Murphy's acting talents to good effect. The movie is in both Japanese and English, with a lot of Japanese dialogue accompanied by English subtitles. Also recommended for those who'd like to watch another ramen-themed movie isTampopo, a highly-entertaining movie.",4,"""A bowl of ramen is a self-contained universe""",1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,2418,"['late', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'shines', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'self-discovery', 'Abby', 'Murphy', 'Japan', 'be', 'boyfriend', 'when', 'dumped', 'fix', 'Unwilling', 'return', 'States', 'thinking', 'still', 'chance', 'make', 'up', 'BF', 'Abby', 'new', 'purpose', 'ramen', 'place', 'street', 'apartment', 'One', 'rainy', 'night', 'despondent', 'Abby', 'wanders', 'ramen', 'shop', 'closing', 'weeping', 'chef', 'Maezumi', 'Toshiyuki', 'Nishida', 'wife', 'are', 'puzzled', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'English', 'Abby', 'ca', ""n't"", 'converse', 'Japanese', 'offer', 'ramen', 'comfort', 'more', 'inspired', 'wonderful', 'taste', 'ramen', 'Abby', 'seized', 'sudden', 'desire', 'learn', 'how', 'cook', 'ramen', 'annoying', 'gnat', 'harassing', 'chef', 'finally', 'apprentice', 'not', 'giving', 'really', 'hard', 'time', 'Abby', 'initial', 'duties', 'include', 'cleaning', 'kitchen', 'dirty', 'toilets', 'as', 'well', 'waiting', 'tables', '.The', 'heated', 'exchanges', 'Abby', 'Maezumi', 'make', 'great', 'entertainment-', 'Maezumi', 'played', 'Nishida', 'irascible', 'taskmaster', 'who', 'lot', 'pain', 'prickly', 'demeanor', 'Abby', 'portrayed', 'brilliantly', 'Murphy', 'initially', 'naive', 'lost', 'soul', 'trying', 'find', 'purpose', 'life', 'adapt', 'foreign', 'environment', 'not', 'speaking', 'Japanese', ""n't"", 'help', 'either', 'also', 'cast', 'secondary', 'characters', 'such', 'American', 'woman', 'who', 'call', 'girl/mistress', 'handsome', 'young', 'Japanese', 'executive', 'who', 'relationship', 'Abby', 'chef', 'wife', 'few', 'eccentric', 'regulars', 'ramen', 'place', 'story', 'not', 'get', 'overly', 'sappy', 'story', 'predictable', 'not', 'couple', 'twists', 'story', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'original', 'certainly', 'well-cast', 'leads', 'make', 'engaging', 'watch', 'took', 'away', 'one', 'star', 'felt', 'secondary', 'characters', 'deserved', 'more', 'development', 'e.g', 'call', 'girl/mistress', 'who', 'just', 'half-way', 'movie', 'whole', 'interesting', 'uplifting', 'drama', 'searching', 'one', 'path', 'life', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'acting', 'talents', 'good', 'effect', 'movie', 'Japanese', 'English', 'lot', 'Japanese', 'dialogue', 'accompanied', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Also', 'recommended', 'who', ""'d"", 'like', 'watch', 'ramen-themed', 'movie', 'isTampopo', 'highly-entertaining', 'movie']",The Ramen Girl
