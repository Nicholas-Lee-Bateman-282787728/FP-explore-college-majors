I tuned in to BBC America, watched the first episode without recording .- which I regretted because I ended up becoming totally sucked into this show, Usually it's the plot of the mystery that grabs you, but here it's the characters - brilliantly written and flawlessly acted by some of the best actors in England (and beyond).  Olivia Coleman is not the same Olivia we're used to (at least in America); the usually gorgeous, dashing David Tennant (the last &#34;Dr. Who&#34;) becomes a worn-out, beat up, middle aged cop, totally defeated by a screwed-up life. (You feel sorry for him and you'd probably like to buy him a beer, but you wouldn't think of going out with him.) These characters become people you feel you really know, the dialogue is that believable, the acting is that good - in fact SO good, you can look into the actors' eyes and know what they're thinking or what they're going to say next, something you can only do with real people in real life.  I taped the rest; it took several DVDs, one got damaged, I never got the first episode so I just caved in and bought it - never regretted it.

Sad episode, but well acted and enjoyable.For what it's worth, you do get closure by the end of the season, even if it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense with what you know of the characters involved.If you're looking for the hyperactive, fast talking, humorous Tennant, go watch WHO.

Nevertheless, it's TV drama of the highest order.David Tennant and Olivia Colman are brilliant as others have duly noted (though you might need subtitles for Tennant's often impenetrable Glaswegian burr), but the excellence extends throughout the large cast.  Notable performances include Jodie Whittaker, who I've adored since 'Venus,' and her on-screen husband, Andrew Buchan, whose sneering countenance as the murder victim's father makes you never quite decided about his innocence.  That's no doubt by design.  He pulls it off magnificently.The best performance of all: David Bradley, who you've seen...everywhere (Harry Potter, Game of Thrones), as Jack Marshall, a.k.a., 'Broadchurch Jack,' an ultimately innocent man, tried, convicted and discarded like chum through the tabloid press.  It's Jack's tale where creator/writer Chris Chibnall's script reaches its apex.  Real life and its onscreen screen partner have never seemed so interchangeable as it does in Chibnall's hands at that moment.

A Brilliant cast, featuring the cream of British actors. The best drama of the year, keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire film. The locations for this film are beautiful.The body of a 11year old boy is found on the beach in Dorset, England. The murder and following investigation create a chain reaction that will tear this small seaside town apart. A town wrapped in secrets, like most small towns anywhere in the world, and they become known as the investigation proceeds. The Murderer remains veiled until the final episode and a surprise and more importantly the reason.The two investigators, DI Hardy a harden, efficient, and blunt outsider with the reputation for failure - played brilliantly by David Tennant - and DS Miller a sensitive and friendly local - played by the extraordinary Olivia Coleman. The interactions between these two is amazing - some of the best dialog and zingers - like when Miller tells Hardy ""leave me alone or I will piss in a cup and throw it on you."" - Or when Hardy tells Miller ""I pray nightly that you will leave me alone.""

1626097,A2AN5WDTIQSLWU,B00BEEKN26,Blue Leaf,"[0, 0]","The best part of this crime drama from the U.K. is that it continually questions the truth, not only of who killed an 11 yr. old boy in the small, idyllic, town of Broadchurch, but of who the people are that make up the town.  At first we only see the lovely exterior of a quaint seaside village and slowly, with each episode, the series tears away at the outwardly perfect exterior of the town and its people and we see the many truths unfold before us.The truths of the townspeople are what draws us deeper into the story.  We are like the lead detective, DI Alec Hardy, played by David Tennant, who do not know that pasts of these people and so are able to be objective while solving the crime.  Then we find out that even Hardy cannot be completely objective because his past is catching up with him and he has made a promise to the family of the murdered boy that he may not be able to keep.Each episode we learn more about what was really happening in the town at the time of the murder and we experience many smaller truths while DI Alec Hardy, DI Ellie Miller and the rest of the police force assigned to the case investigates the motives of the various suspects have for ending the life of a young boy.  What we learn throughout the series is that nothing is what it seems.  There is much more than meets the eye and as soon as the story brings us close to apprehending a suspect the evidence leads us into a different direction.The drama is cleverly written, the acting is excellent, and the setting perfect, or so it seems.",5,Nothing is What it Seems,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",2013,1534,"['best', 'part', 'crime', 'drama', 'U.K.', 'continually', 'questions', 'truth', 'not', 'only', 'who', 'killed', '11', 'yr.', 'old', 'boy', 'small', 'idyllic', 'town', 'Broadchurch', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'make', 'up', 'town', 'first', 'only', 'see', 'lovely', 'exterior', 'quaint', 'seaside', 'village', 'slowly', 'episode', 'series', 'away', 'outwardly', 'perfect', 'exterior', 'town', 'people', 'see', 'many', 'truths', 'unfold', 'us.The', 'truths', 'townspeople', 'are', 'what', 'deeper', 'story', 'are', 'lead', 'detective', 'DI', 'Alec', 'Hardy', 'played', 'David', 'Tennant', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'pasts', 'people', 'so', 'are', 'able', 'be', 'objective', 'solving', 'crime', 'Then', 'find', 'out', 'even', 'Hardy', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'completely', 'objective', 'past', 'catching', 'up', 'made', 'promise', 'family', 'murdered', 'boy', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'keep.Each', 'episode', 'learn', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'happening', 'town', 'time', 'murder', 'experience', 'many', 'smaller', 'truths', 'DI', 'Alec', 'Hardy', 'DI', 'Ellie', 'Miller', 'rest', 'police', 'force', 'assigned', 'case', 'motives', 'various', 'suspects', 'have', 'ending', 'life', 'young', 'boy', 'What', 'learn', 'series', 'nothing', 'what', 'much', 'more', 'eye', 'as', 'soon', 'story', 'close', 'apprehending', 'suspect', 'evidence', 'different', 'direction.The', 'drama', 'cleverly', 'written', 'acting', 'excellent', 'setting', 'perfect', 'so']",Broadchurch - 3-DVD Set

He, by contrast, is as serious and obsessed as one can get in police work. But he is also ripe for atonement because of the murder case which got away from him in his past.When they show up at the murder scene of her neighbor's eleven year old son, this becomes even more evident as he has to restrain her as much as the boy's mother. nevertheless, can she can talk to the people as an insider in this seaside community whereas he is a stiff outsider wholly lacking in people skills.Your sympathy for her character grows as you meet her husband, whose sole contribution to their household seems to be babysitting their eleven year old son.

I also find the BBC and traditional Hollywood projects often take a type of political &#34;side&#34; and then preach about it sometimes not artfully in their movies or series.

To play fair with the audience, a few clues suggesting the murderer's guilt should be provided throughout the script rather than suddenly being revealed after the detective has arrived at the solution. I also wondered, how did the killer repeatedly gain access to the place where he met with the victim? He had a key in the big flashback scene, but how did he obtain it? If this was explained, I missed it.British TV series have one big advantage over American ones--in British productions, average-looking women are allowed to be cast in major roles and to serve as the character the audience identifies with.

LOL  I know that British dramas can be notoriously short, but you know what, sometimes that's a good thing!  With just eight episodes to the Season, Broadchurch rope you in, gave you some prospective on what's it like to have major crime in a small town setting where everyone knows each other and how the ugliness of suspicion can reel it's head.The acting was good.  Di Hardy and DS Miller were two polar-opposites: one standing on the outside looking in, and the other already inside but walks around with prideful denial.  As if to say, ""no one in my town would/could do such a heinous crime.""  To which kept them at odds with one another.The mystery, the shady characters... had me wanting to speculate who done it, however - I did not fool myself into trying to guess whom the culprit could've been.  I waited and episode 8 was explosive!!!!  I would've never thought that 'person' would have been the one.And that last episode was powerful enough that it (I'll admit) made me cry!

Everybody has his or her own agenda and secrets in this story and the story's tension comes from watching them weigh their worth against the greater objective of bringing a killer to justice.

It depicts the uncomfortable fact that everyone is a suspect until they're eliminated from suspicion. And, as in real life, many people seem suspicious because of their alibis or lack thereof.The father of the deceased child is not a sympathetic character. I don't like him at all and feel that the writers can't redeem his character in any way. The mother is in so much emotional pain and has no one to turn to.The detectives investigating the crime are an unusual partnership. The male partner is brooding, on-the-edge and carries a lot of emotional baggage. The female partner is a happily-married wife and mother. (Her son was a friend of the slain boy.) The detectives' antagonism toward each other slowly dissolves as they struggle through their differences. They manage to work together in spite of their differing approaches to solving the mystery.The writers do a good job of plotting the progression of the investigation, and don't skip over the emotional trauma caused by the murder. There are several &#34;bad guys&#34; in the community and each impacts the investigation in some way.

There are many suspects, but no solid evidence.For most detective shows, that would be fodder for one episode. But in &#34;Broadchurch Season 1,&#34; it's only the beginning of a slow-moving, intricate case that ripples through the lives of everyone in a seaside town -- leading to the reveal of ugly secrets and even death. David Tennant and Olivia Colman give astoundingly subtle performances as reluctant police partners, both of whom are troubled by the ugly underside of Broadchurch.Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller (Colman) is outraged when she comes back from vacation and discovers that the the Detective Inspector job has been given to newcomer Alec Hardy (Tennant). But she doesn't have time to focus on that, because the body of a local boy, Danny Latimer, is found dead on the beach. He's been strangled, and someone in peaceful little Broadchurch is responsible.Since Miller has lived in Broadchurch for years and Danny was a friend of her son's, she's reluctant to see his friends and family as suspects. But in Hardy's eyes, everyone is a potential murderer, and the few clues that the investigation has turned up begin to slowly point at several people.As the weeks go by, Danny's murder haunts his fractured family and threatens to drive them further from each other, even as they reluctantly accept some good news. And with no idea who committed the crime, the people of Broadchurch begin to suspect one another of the murder, unearthing ugly long-buried secrets and lies. As time begins running out to solve the murder, Hardy puts his own life on the line to discover who the culprit is.&#34;Broadchurch&#34; is set up in a very different way from most murder mystery shows. While everything revolves around Danny's murder, the focus is not just on Hardy and Miller trying to figure out the crime... but on how his death and the murder case affect everyone in Broadchurch. It's a small community without many violent crimes, so the crime touches the life of everyone there, exposing every terrible secret that they have been hiding. Affairs, sex crimes, alcoholism, and so forth.So rather than just following Miller and Hardy, the show pays attention to how the interlocked web of Broadchurchites are doing. In particular, there's a focus on Danny's grieving family, which splinters under his loss. But the story spreads out over several other people -- Danny's former best friend, the vicar, a thuggish creep, a trio of journalists hunting for a breaking story, a kindly old man, and many others.But that's not to say that the murder investigation doesn't get much attention. It's a bit more realistic than pat solve-the-crime-in-one-hour mystery series -- the story stretches over several weeks, with a cluster of baffling clues that point in several directions at once. At times you wonder if the detectives will figure out what is happening at all, because at times it seems like nothing short of a miracle will give them anything concrete.And like the crime itself, the solving of it has some terrible effects on the detectives. Tennant gives a beautiful, understated performance as Hardy, a man beaten down by scandal and loss who only wants to prove that he can solve a crime. He's so determined that he literally puts himself under deadly strain to solve the case, because he is so desperate to overcome his ugly past.And Tennant has wonderful chemistry with Colman, who plays Hardy's opposite in every way -- Ellie is a kind, good person who has a loving family and believes that the people she knows couldn't have done this. But the investigation strips away that innocence, and reveals to her that -- as Hardy tells her -- everyone is a suspect. No one is safe.&#34;Broadchurch Season 1&#34; has some of the usual contrivances of TV murder mysteries, but the subdued character studies are what make it really enjoyable -- especially with Tennant and Colman in the lead roles.",5,The mystery of Danny,1396569600,"04 4, 2014",2014,3946,"['young', 'boy', 'found', 'murdered', 'beach', 'are', 'many', 'suspects', 'solid', 'evidence.For', 'most', 'detective', 'shows', 'would', 'be', 'fodder', 'one', 'episode', '34', 'Broadchurch', 'Season', '1', '34', 'only', 'beginning', 'slow-moving', 'intricate', 'case', 'lives', 'everyone', 'seaside', 'town', 'leading', 'reveal', 'ugly', 'secrets', 'even', 'death', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Olivia', 'Colman', 'give', 'astoundingly', 'subtle', 'performances', 'reluctant', 'police', 'partners', 'whom', 'are', 'troubled', 'ugly', 'underside', 'Broadchurch.Detective', 'Sergeant', 'Ellie', 'Miller', 'Colman', 'outraged', 'when', 'back', 'vacation', 'discovers', 'Detective', 'Inspector', 'job', 'been', 'given', 'newcomer', 'Alec', 'Hardy', 'Tennant', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'focus', 'body', 'local', 'boy', 'Danny', 'Latimer', 'found', 'dead', 'beach', 'been', 'strangled', 'someone', 'peaceful', 'little', 'Broadchurch', 'responsible.Since', 'Miller', 'lived', 'Broadchurch', 'years', 'Danny', 'was', 'friend', 'son', 'reluctant', 'see', 'friends', 'family', 'suspects', 'Hardy', 'eyes', 'everyone', 'potential', 'murderer', 'few', 'clues', 'investigation', 'turned', 'up', 'begin', 'slowly', 'point', 'several', 'people.As', 'weeks', 'go', 'Danny', 'murder', 'fractured', 'family', 'drive', 'further', 'other', 'even', 'reluctantly', 'good', 'news', 'idea', 'who', 'committed', 'crime', 'people', 'Broadchurch', 'begin', 'suspect', 'one', 'murder', 'unearthing', 'ugly', 'long-buried', 'secrets', 'lies', 'time', 'running', 'out', 'solve', 'murder', 'Hardy', 'own', 'life', 'line', 'discover', 'who', 'culprit', 'is.', '34', 'Broadchurch', '34', 'set', 'up', 'very', 'different', 'way', 'most', 'murder', 'mystery', 'shows', 'everything', 'revolves', 'Danny', 'murder', 'focus', 'not', 'just', 'Hardy', 'Miller', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'crime', 'how', 'death', 'murder', 'case', 'affect', 'everyone', 'Broadchurch', 'small', 'community', 'many', 'violent', 'crimes', 'crime', 'life', 'everyone', 'there', 'exposing', 'terrible', 'secret', 'have', 'been', 'hiding', 'Affairs', 'sex', 'crimes', 'alcoholism', 'so', 'forth.So', 'rather', 'just', 'following', 'Miller', 'Hardy', 'show', 'attention', 'how', 'interlocked', 'web', 'Broadchurchites', 'are', 'doing', 'particular', 'focus', 'Danny', 'grieving', 'family', 'loss', 'story', 'out', 'several', 'other', 'people', 'Danny', 'former', 'best', 'friend', 'vicar', 'thuggish', 'creep', 'trio', 'journalists', 'hunting', 'breaking', 'story', 'kindly', 'old', 'man', 'many', 'others.But', 'not', 'say', 'murder', 'investigation', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'attention', 'bit', 'more', 'realistic', 'pat', 'solve-the-crime-in-one-hour', 'mystery', 'series', 'story', 'several', 'weeks', 'cluster', 'baffling', 'clues', 'point', 'several', 'directions', 'once', 'times', 'wonder', 'detectives', 'will', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happening', 'times', 'nothing', 'short', 'miracle', 'will', 'give', 'anything', 'concrete.And', 'crime', 'solving', 'terrible', 'effects', 'detectives', 'Tennant', 'beautiful', 'understated', 'performance', 'Hardy', 'man', 'beaten', 'down', 'scandal', 'loss', 'who', 'only', 'prove', 'can', 'solve', 'crime', 'so', 'determined', 'literally', 'deadly', 'strain', 'solve', 'case', 'so', 'desperate', 'overcome', 'ugly', 'past.And', 'Tennant', 'wonderful', 'chemistry', 'Colman', 'who', 'Hardy', 'opposite', 'way', 'Ellie', 'kind', 'good', 'person', 'who', 'loving', 'family', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'investigation', 'away', 'innocence', 'reveals', 'Hardy', 'everyone', 'suspect', 'one', 'safe.', '34', 'Broadchurch', 'Season', '1', '34', 'usual', 'contrivances', 'TV', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'subdued', 'character', 'studies', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'especially', 'Tennant', 'Colman', 'lead', 'roles']",Broadchurch - 3-DVD Set

For starters, some U.S. shows can be well over twenty individual hourly episodes, and that&#8217;s a daunting investment of time not only on the part of the critic but also on the part of the readers.  In fact, I&#8217;ve often argued that it&#8217;s practically torturous to even try to do that to myself much less those who read &#8230; which is why I came up with this idea called &#8216;At First Blush.&#8217;  The premise behind it is to see how the show launches in its pilot episode for the sole purpose of determining whether or not that hour (or so) is credible enough to rise to the level of encouraging you &#8211; the viewer &#8211; to make a greater investment.Want to know how BROADCHURCH scores?  Stay tuned.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)In the seaside haven known as Broadchurch, everyone is on a first-name basis.  The police, the newspaper, the businesspeople.  Everyone is your friend, and everyone is always looking out for his or her fellow neighbor.  But one morning the body of an eleven-year-old boy is found on the beach, leaving newly hired Detective Inspector Alec Hardy (played by a surprisingly grizzled David Tennant of DOCTOR WHO fame) to start asking questions no one wants to ask.  Before all is said and done, he might expose more secrets than any one town should keep.In the early 90&#8217;s, a little show called TWIN PEAKS was all the rage &#8230; for all of about fifteen minutes of fame.  That isn&#8217;t because the program didn&#8217;t have &#8216;legs&#8217; or characters or good stories; rather, it&#8217;s because creator/showrunner David Lynch veered in wildly unpredictable directions, so much so he spent more time confusing viewers with symbolism than he ever did answering any of the mystery&#8217;s best questions.  Performances were solid though sometimes unnecessarily quirky, but what also worked for me &#8211; its central conceit &#8211; was that the &#8216;small town motif&#8217; was little more than a massive con job on the part of the populace.  PEAKS always reminded us that there were dark deeds afoot when you pulled back that small town veneer, and these were the kinds of things that could get you killed.BROADCHURCH feels much the same way.  Broadchurch (the town) is meant to be anywhere &#8211; any town &#8211; with its resident do-gooders and well-wishers.  This first episode is launched with a long sequence of a character walking through the downtown area, greeting every passerby with a welcome nod or a kind word; and it&#8217;s all meant to invoke that feeling of serenity common to these storybook streets.  Everyone knows everyone else &#8230; but do they really?Those suspicions continue to mount over this first episode.  Smartly shot and keenly assembled, BROADCHURCH&#8217;s initial hour (45 minutes, really) is laced with an eerily haunting scores, characters giving second glances into the camera, and cleverly suggestive cinematography.  Nothing here is what it seems &#8211; not the work promotion you were promised, not the safety and security small towns supposedly offered &#8211; and I suspect it&#8217;ll all start bubbling to the surface relatively quickly.  Even our lead investigator is harboring some secret involving his handling of a past case, so maybe &#8211; just maybe &#8211; that lone voice of comfort calling the shots might have his own skeleton (or two?) in a closet back home.While there&#8217;s a respectable amount of predictability to a few moments (a grieving father continues to refer to his deceased son with a friendly nickname; too many inter-related characters always spoil the brew), BROADCHURCH is crafted with great care and affection, the kind of which compels the typical viewer to watch closely, don&#8217;t look away, for fear of missing some vital link, some important clue, that&#8217;ll cast these events in a new light.  Granted, it&#8217;s only a first hour, but it&#8217;s so smartly made I can give it room to breathe.Who knows what we&#8217;ll find?BROADCHURCH: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is produced by Kudos Film and Television, Imaginary Friends, and Independent Television (ITV).  DVD distribution is being handled by E One Entertainment (aka Entertainment One).  As for the technical specifications, wow!  This smartly assembled production puts together some terrific cinematography and sterling sound work, all of it capturing an almost macabre undercurrent to such an idyllic seaside setting.  Lastly, if it&#8217;s special features you want, then you have a behind-the-scenes short and some deleted scenes to look forward to: not a great package, but at least they threw in something.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  Sure, I&#8217;m going into this full well with the knowledge that I&#8217;ve only seen the first episode, but the first episode of BROACHURCH is a simmering doozy.  It has everything one could want &#8211; tragedy, mystery, and misery &#8211; and then some, packing in a handful of characters whose motivations might not be as clear as they appear at first blush.  There were a few moments of predictable pathos and even one moment of horribly inauthentic dialogue, but that&#8217;s a small price to pay for something that looks to be this inviting.  Murder rarely looks this delicious.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at E One Entertainment (aka Entertainment One) provided me with a DVD copy of

1626137,A1K3P9WRC0WPW5,B00BEEKN26,"Elizabeth S. ""PACATEX""","[1, 1]","For those of you needing exceptional British drama while waiting for Downton Abbey to return, I'd like to HIGHLY recommend this series (8 episodes).  We just finished watching it via Amazon.com.  Excellent acting, riveting storyline.  It kept me guessing who the killer was until the very last episode.  I avoided it for a long time because I had read reviews that said it was very dark and disturbing, and solving the murder of an 11-year-old boy is dark, however the BBC didn't make it graphic for shock value.  They treated the story with respect, unlike a lot of American crime dramas that go for gross-out factor and &#34;jump&#34; scenes.  This story is about the effects the murder has on a small coastal community and the secrets of its citizens which are revealed during the investigation.  There is just no obvious motive for his murder, so therefore it's difficult to rule anyone out as a suspect.  The drama is so realistic that I was not aware I was watching a television show.  The brilliant  and talented actors look like everyday real people, not pretty plastic Hollywood types acting at being believable everyday people.  The emotional scenes, especially a few by the victim's father, are painfully realistic.

1626138,A1C70R9KCILEU,B00BEEKN26,Elle,"[8, 10]","I think mine will be something like the 462nd review so I wonder what I can say that hasn't already been said and done so in the most amazing ways.  Have you noticed what absolutely jaw-dropping reviewers there are on Amazon?  There really is absolutely no reason or need to read the 462nd review in order to determine if this program will appeal to you.  Again, especially when the best of the best have already outlined everything you need to know. The only person who will ever read this review is my husband when Amazon emails the confirmation that it has gone live!  :-)  Still, I will add my stars to the tab this remarkable series is racking up.  I can't sleep and need something to do.From the opening of the first episode I was taken in the grip of this drama.  It had me by the throat and punched me in the gut.  I literally couldn't breathe in some parts.  Be warned, it is most of the time so painful to watch.  I cried.  I couldn't help it.  I got caught up in it.  As a parent, I had no problem whatsoever relating to the nightmare unfolding in the lives of the family of the murdered boy. Talk about intense! I started watching as soon as the first episode became available and therefore had to wait until each subsequent episode was released.  I actually didn't watch each episode as soon as it was downloaded because I didn't know if I could take any more!  But I did continue to watch.  I had to...a saga about each individual in the show was being revealed.  It became more than the effect this death had on the victim's family.  It expanded to every single person in the small community of Broadchurch.Don't expect any relief or distraction from the horror of the murder of a young boy.  It was sad without any let up.  The music was beautiful and haunting.  There was no waking up from the nightmare and the sun coming up in the morning.  Which is exactly what I imagine it would be like to live through such a traumatic event. There is no happy ending.  The final episode, 8, is a devastating reveal of the murderer and the added trauma it causes. Someone murdered this child in a small close-knit community.  It must have been a stranger that did this evil thing, right?  Could finding out that the murderer is someone known to this traumatized family make it even more painful? Perhaps. Still, Broadchurch is a beach front ""tourist"" town so it is probably a stranger.  When suspicion begins to be cast about...upon locals...what is the resulting response of everyone!  Good questions. These questions are faced in this series.I liked the writing.  I liked the way the story was told.  I got right away that this was more than a whodunit. I liked that I wasn't ""let in"" on who the killer was or even what motivated the murder.  (I give no clues whatsoever on who the murderer ends up to be.  Who knows, my husband may want to watch this and I want him to see for himself. The writer was making a point.  I got the impression that a philosophy was being put forth.  For me, the ""lesson"" was one of not jumping to conclusions, that appearances can definitely be deceiving; things aren't usually as straight forward as they first appear.  Peoples' actions and behavior always has a why behind them.  (Someone says something and I always wonder to myself, ""Why"" did they say that?  And a lot of the time the dialogue in both film and books, for me, is hugely disconnected between what is said and why a person would possibly say it.  Would they really say that?)  You know, the character being put forth says and does something that should be totally out of character.  Maybe that's just my thing.  In regards to the lessons I thought being put forth, they are pretty much universally known but not regularly represented in television viewing today.  At least IMO not in the genre that I enjoy.  People seem more commonly represented as rather shallow.  Which doesn't represent at all what I imagine folks in the portrayed roles would be like to do the jobs they do.  I think it is nice to have to unravel the layers of folks, myself, rather than have it done for me.  I enjoyed how ""the why"" which motivated and shaped each person's behavior was revealed.  How and why did they get where they were in their lives?  Some sins do indeed have long shadows and they don't necessarily have to be your own.  So, how do people live through, get beyond, and even overcome events in their lives.  There are a lot of walking wounded.  And they abound in this program. Some programs are pure escapism, not this one. It's a drama, a tragedy. It is not a typical crime procedural (I believe that is the term.) I didn't think that this show was mainly about solving the murder.  It was mainly about how the murder effected the family and then in a ripple effect every other person in the community and further.I was transported from my sofa into the community of Broadchurch.  I became a neighbor and emotionally connected.  By developing the characters over several episodes there was a greater depth to everyone.I can't find fault with any of the acting. It was completely top-notch.  I am a huge fan of British programming and I am constantly awed by the degree of greatness in the acting!  These folks are good.  They don't get their roles because they look good on camera and in jeans without a T-shirt!  I've never followed the Dr. Who series so am not familiar with Tenant in that role.  I thought he was masterful.  He played a mournful and deeply scarred person to perfection.  He was driven in his pursuit of the truth.  I wanted to know what had happened to him that had shaped him. He was an outsider in Broadchurch. He was sent there to solve this murder. His connection was personal, that was made plain, but it wasn't a connection to the victim or anyone involved.  Now, on the other hand, Detective Ellie was a local.  Her son was a close friend of the murdered boy.  Her family was closely connected to and lived just a few doors down from the victim.  Like everyone else in Broadchurch this was up-close-and-personal. She should have been in charge of the case but arriving to the office was blindsided by having Tenant assigned instead.  To add insult to injury she was forced to endure his rough and insensitive manner. The suspects were her friends and she began the investigation pretty much unable to even consider that someone she knows could have committed such an atrocity to one of their own. As the story unfolds she begins to see people once so familiar to her in different ways.  The actress who played her was brilliant.  I've seen her around in other programs but never would have expected such a riveting and realistic portrayal.  The emotion she brought to the role was astounding.  She was completely believable and real to me.  I definitely have respect for her ability as an actress now!  I can only imagine what a role like this would mean to an actress who previously in her career was relegated to small ho-hum parts. (At least those I saw.) I will definitely be learning her name and looking for her in further roles. (I'm writing this in the middle of the night, from my email page, you know how Amazon prompts you to review something you've purchased, so don't have this info in front of me BUT I will be looking it up in the AM!) It would be a glaring omission not to mention how well all the other roles were acted.  The young murdered boy was painfully beautiful.  His parents portrayed the crippling and devastating blow of losing their son absolutely superbly. You'll see the supporting characters perform their parts perfectly.  I didn't find fault with any and appreciated the casting.At the conclusion we are notified that ""Broadchurch will return.""  For me, I will watch to see what the writer(s) will bring to the screen next.  I would like to see what happens to these folks.  Could I stand to see another 8 episodes of such heart wrenching melancholy? I'm really not sure.  This offering was painful for me.  It was so real. So, in follow-up programming I would like to see something with the intense acting, superb writing but perhaps a little relief from the drama.  I don't need comedy.  I'm talking some breathing room.  A person needs to be able to breathe when a program is nearly 8 hours long.  Anyway, I'll be taking a peek at what might be happening next in Broadchurch.The rating is appropriate for the content of the subject matter.  There were no scenes of graphic sex or gory violence a change of what one normally sees these days in any kind of drama involving murder.  No autopsies or mutilated corpse was depicted.  (The subject matter was horrific enough without adding any of that!) The only sex scene was of the couple after the act and both were either clothed or completely covered. All of these things are something I greatly appreciate because I don't want to see it.  There is mild swearing that I've come to expect in a program of this rating and I think only one use of the ""F"" word at the end.",5,BEWARE!

1626144,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B00BEEKN26,FYI,"[1, 1]","Set on the U.K.'s wind-buffeted Dorset coast (filmed in Clevedon), ITV's &#34;Broadchurch&#34; is a mystery series that deeply engages the audience. The narrative follows the loss and trauma following the murder of a young boy, and the search for his killer. Thankfully, for fans who faithfully followed this compelling show, &#34;Broadchurch&#34; will be returning for a second series in 2014! When &#34;Broadchurch&#34; was originally transmitted in the U.K., viewership grew so much that by the series conclusion, the producers and writers (who had only intended one series) were compelled to continue.Series One begins on a hazy summer morning along the lovely Dorset coastline, during the tourist season. An 11 year old boy, Danny Latimer (Oskar McNamara), goes missing. His mother, awoken with nightmares in the wee hours, desperately searches for her son. Later in the day, his body is discovered below the white cliffs. The mystery involves an entire community, exploring bonds of trust that are tested and broken. The remarkable cast makes &#34;Broadchurch&#34; standout. David Tennant is one of the best actors out there; as Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, he brings an award-winning level of intensity and nuance to the part. DI Hardy, buffeted by life, takes this case after barely surviving the ensuing scandal when a previous case was bungled; the victim's parents continue to blame him for the failure. Viewers learn that there is more to his past, and tragedy drives Hardy to solve this new case, despite its effect on his frail health.Olivia Colman is Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller; she lost out on a promotion to newcomer DI Hardy. She is a good friend to Danny's mother, Beth Latimer (the superb Jodie Whittaker is utterly convincing), and her young son Tom (Adam Wilson) was apparently Danny's friend. Wrestling with grief, Beth Latimer discovers she is pregnant with her third child, a situation all the more tumultuous after she discovers that her husband Mark (Andrew Buchan) has been having an affair with Becca Fisher (Simone McAullay). Becca works at the hotel where DI Hardy is staying. Beth turns to her vicar, the Reverend Paul Coates (Arthur Darvill, glad to see he survived a thankless role in &#34;Doctor Who&#34;), for solace. Beth's frail faith is shaken to the core by the loss of her son, his absence is palpable.DS Ellie Miller's husband, Joe (Matthew Gravelle), seems to be oblivious to their son's problems, while trying to support his wife. DS Miller dislikes DI Hardy and his cynicism, and finds the investigation of her community quite difficult to cope with. An unsavory element is the muckraking of journalists. The editor of the local paper, Maggie Radcliffe (Carolyn Pickles), attempts to control junior reporter Olly Stevens (Jonathan Bailey); he is Ellie's nephew. Jack Marshall (the superb David Bradley, of &#34;Harry Potter&#34;) faces terrible accusations when his past is unearthed; the actor David Bradley should be far better known. Another suspect, Susan Wright (Pauline Quirke is perfect) menaces Maggie one evening at the paper. Susan lives on the beach in a trailer, and knows more than she lets on. She has strange relationship with plumber Tom Latimer's employee Nigel Carter (Joe Sims), and Nigel threatens her with a crossbow. Throughout, it appears Danny may have been blackmailing people; there is an undertow of darkness in Broadchurch.No matter how surrounded he is by coworkers and the community Broadchurch suspects, Detective Inspector Alec Hardy is dreadfully alone. Just as Broadchurch's cliffs drop dramatically to the sea, where water meets land and sky in sharp delineation, his soul seems on the cusp of a precipitous fall. Aside from a fine cast overall, the show's momentum is provided by its leads. David Tennant as DI Hardy inhabits the character from the inside out. Tennant, a remarkable actor, conveys a soul tormented by immense pressure, a storm within and without. Olivia Colman is superb as DS Ellie Miller, she summons up a world of pain that is harrowing and remarkable to behold. The last scene, with beacons of torchlight and bonfires shimmering in the darkness along the coast, and Beth seeing Danny's ghost, is deeply evocative.

It is tragic, with intersecting lives seemingly doomed to unhappiness, The acting is spectacular all round, and I mean spectacular.But it only gets four stars for me because it was so drawn out that at one point we almost decided to stop watching it (on TV).As a Doctor Who fan, it is delightful to see David Tennant in a role so different from the Doctor, and where his Welsh accent is clear. Tennant's character, like the whole Broadchurch series, is dark and unhappy, for good reason, you eventually find out. It does get a little old when week after week (when watching it on TV) there is no goodness and light anywhere to be seen.But if you stick with it, you will see what hells we make for ourselves.

Nothing will ever be the same as secrets are revealed and everyone becomes a suspect. BROADCHURCH is storytelling at its extreme best. A talented and diverse cast and a gorgeous setting with haunting music and stylish photography make this stunning series unlike anything else on TV.Alec Hardy (David Tenant) and Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman) team up to solve the murder of Danny Latimer. Although serious crime seems rare in BROADCHURCH, it does seem to have a large police department who are unaccustomed to murder cases. The peace has been forever shattered as just about everyone in town, except for Hardy and Miller, are suspects. The young handsome church vicar has a secret as does the local news agent. What about the mysterious Susan Wright, the town loner who lives in the caravan (trailer) park by the sea? This is British crime drama at its best with a cast of delightful character actors, whose every expression and every line on his or face tells a story. BROADCHURCH is refreshing as we have &#34;ordinary&#34; people instead of the usual attractive male cop falling for the gorgeous female cop. The show is about real people that any of us see in our day to day life.Writer Chris Chibnall has created a real gem of a story. Twists and turns keep us addicted to the story as just about everyone becomes a suspect as their secret pasts are revealed. The story can be compared to the Salem Witch Trials in the US as hysteria grips the town and anyone with a suspicious &#34;past&#34; is hounded unmercifully. And we often learn that some people have a legitimate reason to hide their past.This is a great cast and I was particularly drawn to Pauline Quirke as Susan Wright. Her mystery is written on her face and she is hiding something but what? She owns a lovely dog and as an aside, her real life dog plays her dog in the show. A bit of great casting and a gorgeous dog.Beautiful photography and a stunningly gorgeous setting are their own are enough to make this show very special.

UK Detective Series are a personal favorite of mine, but there is normally some aspect that makes me wince, whether it be gratuitous sexuality or language, an unrealistic characterization, or a preachy story line around political correctness. None of those things are present here.And wonder of wonders, the subject of religious faith is treated with respect, something one can rarely find in any media presentation these days.Olivia Colman's performance is always deeply nuanced, and this role called upon all her acting resources to portray this complex woman of high integrity dealing with issues that would slay the best of us. She is 100% believable and creates a living, breathing personality -- someone you'd like to know and share life over coffee with. I want to see everything she has ever done. David Tennant is also brilliant as the scraggly, quirky, irascible DI Hardy.The story line is compelling and original and I was not sure of the resolution until the last few minutes, as suspicion falls on most of the characters until almost the very end. I often lose interest the moment the mystery is solved, but this series kept its magic for me right up until the very moving and satisfying last few minutes, and the mood lingered long after the credits rolled.Not all questions are answered, but that's just how life is. They never are. Paraphrasing DI Hardy (and echoing my lifelong belief), &#34;People are unknowable. You can never truly know the heart of another human being.&#34;",5,A fine series on every single front,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2014,1681,"['makers', 'series', 'resounding', 'round', 'applause', 'standing', 'ovation', 'care', 'sensitivity', 'creativity', 'consummate', 'virtuosity', 'went', 'making', 'series', 'UK', 'Detective', 'Series', 'are', 'personal', 'favorite', 'mine', 'normally', 'aspect', 'wince', 'be', 'gratuitous', 'sexuality', 'language', 'unrealistic', 'characterization', 'preachy', 'story', 'line', 'political', 'correctness', 'None', 'things', 'are', 'present', 'here.And', 'wonder', 'wonders', 'subject', 'religious', 'faith', 'treated', 'respect', 'something', 'one', 'can', 'rarely', 'find', 'media', 'presentation', 'days.Olivia', 'Colman', 'performance', 'always', 'deeply', 'nuanced', 'role', 'called', 'acting', 'resources', 'portray', 'complex', 'woman', 'high', 'integrity', 'dealing', 'issues', 'would', 'slay', 'best', '100', '%', 'believable', 'living', 'breathing', 'personality', 'someone', ""'d"", 'like', 'know', 'share', 'life', 'coffee', 'want', 'see', 'everything', 'ever', 'done', 'David', 'Tennant', 'also', 'brilliant', 'scraggly', 'quirky', 'irascible', 'DI', 'Hardy.The', 'story', 'line', 'compelling', 'original', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'resolution', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'suspicion', 'most', 'characters', 'almost', 'very', 'end', 'often', 'lose', 'interest', 'moment', 'mystery', 'solved', 'series', 'kept', 'magic', 'right', 'up', 'very', 'moving', 'satisfying', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'mood', 'lingered', 'long', 'credits', 'rolled.Not', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'just', 'how', 'life', 'never', 'are', 'Paraphrasing', 'DI', 'Hardy', 'echoing', 'lifelong', 'belief', '34', 'People', 'are', 'unknowable', 'can', 'never', 'truly', 'know', 'heart', 'human', 'being.', '34']",Broadchurch - 3-DVD Set

I really can't find fault with so much of this show, but by mid-way through it I had soured on the pacing and plot turns, and while Broadchurch never sank to the exploitive depths of grief porn that, say, the American version of The Killing did, I confess I was somewhat less interested in prolonged examination of the murder's effect on the victim's family as I was in solving the case in the first place. The twist at the end I didn't really care for -- I thought it was too pulpy and sensational. Many of the actions of the lead characters didn't quite make sense to me, and I found the angst and health crises of Tennant's character really overblown and distracting. But, as they say, aside from that....The British are so good at casting, production, dialogue, etc. -- when will they learn to once again tell a story that is coherent, focused and makes complete sense?

As the police investigation unfolds, and the villagers fall under suspicion, long buried secrets, and present ones, are revealed much to the shock of the the community and loved ones, who never suspected anything was amiss. And so, the essential unknowabilty of others, and of their motivations or why they chose to act on their destructive desires becomes the fascinating glue which holds this story together.Though I long guessed the identity of the perpetrator, the intimacy, vulnerability, rage and shame exhibited by the characters in the final episode was so well done and so very shocking that I actually had nightmares afterward.Very good script, and wonderful acting particularly from Olivia Colman who plays the kind and sensitive policewoman Ellie Miller.

It is so believable a story that you get quickly and easily sucked into the whodunit theme you CANNOT miss a single episode. And every time you believe that the show is getting a bit stale, something incredible changes the storyline or the possible suspect in the death of an 11 year old boy.I am so glad the British do not try at all to emulate American TV shows because they usually have the best and most interesting storylines, characters and mysteries, than I have ever seen or enjoyed more.  At first I found myself addicted to Orphan Black, ANOTHER great BBC story, I believe produced in Canada.  Was hanging on every episode then, only to find myself drawn back into yet another classic story.Being a Doctor Who fan (from 63 - present) I did not just start watching BroadChurch because David Tennant was in this, though I must admit I didn't think I could take him out of the Tardis and into a Police Office, but he worked it.

Yes, there is a murder, and the solving of it is the central thread. But Broadchurch is a full dramatic tapestry, with fine subplots and side stories about the inhabitants of the town and how their lives are affected by this murder. Along the way, there are numerous red herrings and inviting alleys that turn out to be blind in the end. The writing and acting are superb. And the setting, thankfully, is a sunny seaside town, rather than a dreary, continuously rainy Seattle. I hope the Blu-ray, which contains additional commentary, is released in Region 1 format. The DVD is not yet in Region 1 format either.I know a U.S. remake of this is planned, with Chris Chibnall as producer. I hope he can catch lightning in a bottle twice.

Usually, I'm well aware of even minor flaws, but everything from the casting to the directing, the acting to the cinematography, is all beautifully done. The story holds the viewer from the first minute. In a peaceful little town in Britain, where it appears that nothing much ever happens and everyone knows everyone else, a young boy is murdered. Immediately, like a stone thrown into a pond, the ripples spread out to engulf each person and each sector of the community. The actors have that wonderful British look: crooked teeth, wrinkles, a refreshing lack of plastic surgery and Botox, so that they look like real people and you can tell them apart. No lineup of Barbie dolls and stud muffins here! The location is just charming enough to emphasize the horror of what has occurred, and just seedy enough to emphasize that there's more to this than meets the eye. To top it off, a local newspaperman finds himself in hot water as, struggling to get assigned to a major paper, he jumps the gun with the media and a bigger player comes to town. The main protagonists - though they don't steal the scenes but blend in harmoniously - are the new lead investigator, fresh from a scandalous situation in the big city, and the local woman who expected to get his job. Since most folks are friends or relatives (the reporter is the nephew of the female investigator), it seems hard to keep a secret, yet secrets abound. The first episode, without appearing rushed or confusing, manages to bring in a host of suspicious people and events and attitudes. One of the best things about the series is that it is a closed one, i.e. you know in advance that the whole story will be wound up in 8 episodes. That keeps it tight and prevents unnecessary filler, such as the kind found in series which are open-ended. I happen to know the whole story arc, but the acting will keep me glued to the screen for the next 7 episodes. The series has not only been renewed (presumably with a different case to be solved) but American tv is developing a version of it.

1626249,A3K5IQIPLBKQAM,B00BEEKN26,Pipkin Sweetgrass,"[9, 10]","I can't say too much how much I enjoyed this series. Unlike most murder dramas, this story isn't about autopsies and gunfights. It's about human nature. It's about the tragedy of the murder of a child. It's about the court of public opinion, the sinister nature of irresponsible journalism, the failures, frailties and flaws of our fellow human beings. This is 'Shakespeare writes a detective story'.Chris Chibnall has now gone to the top of my list as a writer. It was beautifully done. In no way has he broken the cardinal rule of show, don't tell. Nor has he made the horrible mistake of creating any perfect character. All of them, from youngest to oldest, are wonderfully imperfect human beings, and with no character is this more obvious than our protagonist, DI Alec Hardy, masterfully played by David Tennant as the world-weary detective with secrets of his own and a shadowy past. He is so wonderfully written by Chibnall and executed by Tennant that we find ourselves won over by a character that on the surface is quite unlikable. Tennant's performance has, IMO, overshadowed his role in Doctor Who with this work. He has proven before that he's far more than the Tenth Doctor. With his Hardy, he made me forget about all other roles.Olivia Colman, too, is wonderful. Her character enjoys a growth that's wonderful to behold. Colman is as good as any actress out there. I've seen her before, but with her Ellie Miller, she has captured me completely.In fact not a single actor or actress was badly chosen. From eldest to youngest and male and female, all of them turned in sterling performances. Even the dog! I was especially pleased with Arthur Darvill. Young Adam Wilson, who played Tom Miller, was quite impressive as well.This series is what TV should look like. This is what The Killing should have looked like. This is TV at it's finest. The story arc was magnificent, centered, not on procedurals and junk science-based CSI (actual CSI is nothing like what's shown on TV) but on the tragedy of it, and how that tragedy bled into the lives of the people of Broadchurch, itself, even the ones investigating it. The dialog was wonderful, especially the banter between Hardy and Miller, whose polar-opposite natures should have been cliche, yet were pulled off masterfully by Colman and Tennant. Hardy's subplot was simply divine. We find out why he is so world-weary, yet, in the end are still left with the mystery of him, and know he is Broadchurch's greatest mystery still. Little touches, like the 'love thy neighbor' signs add further richness and poignancy and lend the tale yet more humanity. Rich in character development, beautifully photographed, the series ended in a perfect denouement. And the best part is we are left wanting more, which is the mark of a truly great story.",5,Breath-taking Broadchurch,1380153600,"09 26, 2013",2013,2803,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'too', 'much', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'most', 'murder', 'dramas', 'story', ""n't"", 'autopsies', 'gunfights', 'human', 'nature', 'tragedy', 'murder', 'child', 'court', 'public', 'opinion', 'sinister', 'nature', 'irresponsible', 'journalism', 'failures', 'frailties', 'flaws', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', ""'Shakespeare"", 'detective', ""story'.Chris"", 'Chibnall', 'now', 'gone', 'top', 'list', 'writer', 'was', 'beautifully', 'done', 'way', 'broken', 'cardinal', 'rule', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'made', 'horrible', 'mistake', 'creating', 'perfect', 'character', 'youngest', 'oldest', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'imperfect', 'human', 'beings', 'character', 'more', 'obvious', 'protagonist', 'DI', 'Alec', 'Hardy', 'masterfully', 'played', 'David', 'Tennant', 'world-weary', 'detective', 'secrets', 'own', 'shadowy', 'past', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'written', 'Chibnall', 'executed', 'Tennant', 'find', 'won', 'over', 'character', 'surface', 'quite', 'unlikable', 'Tennant', 'performance', 'IMO', 'overshadowed', 'role', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'work', 'proven', 'far', 'more', 'Tenth', 'Doctor', 'Hardy', 'made', 'forget', 'other', 'roles.Olivia', 'Colman', 'too', 'wonderful', 'character', 'growth', 'wonderful', 'behold', 'Colman', 'as', 'good', 'actress', 'there', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ellie', 'Miller', 'captured', 'completely.In', 'fact', 'not', 'single', 'actor', 'actress', 'was', 'badly', 'chosen', 'eldest', 'youngest', 'male', 'female', 'turned', 'sterling', 'performances', 'Even', 'dog', 'was', 'especially', 'pleased', 'Arthur', 'Darvill', 'Young', 'Adam', 'Wilson', 'who', 'played', 'Tom', 'Miller', 'was', 'quite', 'impressive', 'well.This', 'series', 'what', 'TV', 'should', 'look', 'what', 'Killing', 'should', 'have', 'looked', 'TV', 'finest', 'story', 'arc', 'was', 'magnificent', 'centered', 'not', 'procedurals', 'junk', 'science-based', 'CSI', 'actual', 'CSI', 'nothing', 'what', 'shown', 'TV', 'tragedy', 'how', 'tragedy', 'bled', 'lives', 'people', 'Broadchurch', 'even', 'ones', 'investigating', 'dialog', 'was', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'banter', 'Hardy', 'Miller', 'polar-opposite', 'natures', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cliche', 'were', 'pulled', 'off', 'masterfully', 'Colman', 'Tennant', 'Hardy', 'subplot', 'was', 'simply', 'divine', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'so', 'world-weary', 'yet', 'end', 'are', 'still', 'left', 'mystery', 'know', 'Broadchurch', 'greatest', 'mystery', 'still', 'Little', 'touches', ""'love"", 'thy', 'neighbor', 'signs', 'add', 'further', 'richness', 'poignancy', 'lend', 'tale', 'yet', 'more', 'humanity', 'Rich', 'character', 'development', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'series', 'ended', 'perfect', 'denouement', 'best', 'part', 'are', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'mark', 'truly', 'great', 'story']",Broadchurch - 3-DVD Set

1626260,A35DI28HRSEEP6,B00BEEKN26,Richard B. Schwartz,"[2, 2]","Broadchurch is a coastal town in Dorset.  On the beach, beneath a cliff, the body of an 11 year-old boy is found.  He has not fallen to his death, but been strangled.  A local psychic (?) suggests that his body has been brought to the shore in a boat.A local detective sergeant (Ellie Miller, played by Olivia Colman) has expected to be promoted and put in charge of the case.  However, she is preempted by detective inspector Alec Hardy (played by David Tennant) who has been brought in from the outside.  Hardy was in charge of a celebrated, failed case in the past and he has a severe heart condition, which he has concealed from his superiors.  Together they will investigate the death of the 11 year-old, a friend of Ellie's son, Tom.  Their relationship will be both strained and respectful.The investigation is explored in eight segments (ca. 45-50 minutes each).  By the conclusion, nearly every resident of Broadchurch will become a suspect and a host of subsidiary, sometimes unrelated secrets will be revealed.This series was immensely popular in the UK and was recommended to us as a `don't miss' by English friends.  It certainly lived up to expectations.  By the final segments we were staying up into the small hours as the series reached its conclusion.  In some ways this is an ensemble cast show; the parents of the dead child probably have as many lines as the detectives.  The performances are all strong, the setting is utilized very effectively and the mystery is compelling.The writing is not quite of `Endeavour' or `Foyle's War' quality.  It is not as memorable or as profoundly moving as those shows can be.  On the other hand, the plot is strong and your attention never flags.The `feel' of the show is interesting.  It is not quite Twin Peaksish, but there are several interesting, otherworldly characters and throughout we have the sense that we have entered an enclosed society that has guarded its secrets very carefully.  That, of course, is the standard ethos of the English mystery, but here there is an added dimension, largely provided by the setting and the direction.  The sea is vast, the waves loud, the cliff menacingly high, the town itself relatively deserted (certainly by Dorset standards), the caravans (=trailers) frightening and ominous.This is strong material.

It was alongside my sister and her boyfriend, and we were completely riveted throughout all eight episodes. We raced through four episodes on the first night, and the remaining four on the second, with the time in between spent speculating on suspects, motives, and red herrings.Broadchurch is a serene and popular holiday destination, where everyone knows everybody and nothing out of the ordinary ever happens. Then the day comes when Beth Lattimer wakes up from a strange dream of her eleven-year old son Danny standing at the cliff-top above the shoreline. The morning commences, with her husband and daughter going about their business, and Beth assumes that Danny has already left for his paper-round before the rest of the family were out of bed. It's not until hours later that she realizes he never turned up to school, and when word reaches her that a body has been found at the base of the cliffs at the beach, she knows instinctively that it's him.Newly-arrived DI Alec Hardy and long-time resident DS Ellie Miller are chosen to the lead the investigation, the latter having just been passed over for promotion in favour of the former. Ellie's aggravation over this is soon put on the back-burner when Danny's body is found, as she is badly shaken over the fact that she knows the Lattimer family well, and that her own son was friends with the deceased boy.Played by David Tennant (best known as the Tenth Doctor onDoctor Who, though you'll hardly recognise him here) and Olivia Coleman (who outshines even Tennant as a woman you can instantly identify with) the two are initially antagonistic to each other despite their visible effort to be cordial and professional. As the series goes on, their animosity eventually grows into mutual respect, and the trajectory of Ellie's character in particular is wonderfully plotted: she starts as a woman who hates to think the worst of anyone, to someone who can effectively take charge and form suspicions over nearly everyone in town.But the real star of the show is the community of Broadchurch. Make no mistake, this is an ensemble piece, and the murder itself is more of a framing device used to explore the town and its residents. Key to the show's success is that it is not simply a whodunit, but also a character study of a grieving family and a shell-shocked community, where everyone has some sort of dark secret and a different reaction to the murder. Parents are scared for their own children, whilst business-owners are annoyed that they're losing income. Various members of the media swarm in to take advantage of the tragedy, and a few creepy residents are given the stink-eye by the rest of the community. A psychic approaches the family for reasons that may or may not be mercenary. A priest uses the death to fill the near-empty pews in his church.At the centre of the maelstrom is the Miller family and our two investigators. Blunt and world-weary, Hardy hates the town and its people, but considers it his penance for an unspoken screw-up in his past, whilst Ellie finds it increasingly hard to suspect her fellow townsfolk as potential murderers. In the Millers we have an exquisite portrayal of family grief as they grapple with the death of their son/grandson/brother, and several of the show's most powerful moments ignore the ""whodunit"" aspect entirely and simply focus on how a little family tries to pull itself back together after being torn asunder.But the real treat is that every single character, no matter how awful they seem at first glance, will have at least a few moments when the audience understands or sympathises with them. Even staple characters like journalists, psychics and rubberneckers, all of which you'd expect to be wholly unsympathetic, have more layers than to them than you'd first assume.There are a few false notes: it seems high unlikely that a man of Hardy's scruffy appearance and obvious medical issues would be allowed to run such a high-profile investigation, and the police in general come across as less than competent most of the time (and not in a forgivably realistic way either). They fail to bring in obvious suspects, the media uncovers most of the pertinent information for them, and ultimately the solution falls into their laps rather than get uncovered by their detective work.But for the most part, everything is just compelling: the characters, the setting, the setup, and the myriad of various subplots which provide the necessary twists and red herrings that every murder-mystery requires. The horror of a child's death is offset by the general beauty of the environment, and a sensible balance is struck between the portrayal of the family's grief and the police hunt for the killer. Even the supporting characters are fully fleshed-out individuals, each one with their virtues and foibles. David Tennant and Olivia Coleman lead the entire cast in what is ultimately a depiction of grief: for children, for past mistakes, for lost opportunities, for the past and future.It all makes for totally engrossing television, one filled with rich storytelling and wonderful performances. I guarantee you'll be thinking about it for days afterwards.",5,"""Anyone is Capable of this Murder, Given the Right Circumstances...""",1388793600,"01 4, 2014",2014,5253,"['best', 'way', 'sell',

I don't care one way or another about Tennant, and I suspect many people are stating the negative reviews aren't helpful merely because they have a crush on him.The show was bogged down in lots of slow-mo.  So many undeveloped characters.  Motive, execution, reveal of crime were thoroughly unconvincing.  I agree with what most 1-3 star reviewers wrote about it.I add another objection: the female lead.  I don't consider myself a strong feminist, but I was disgusted with her character's performance.  She loses the top job to a man who is so sick he can't undergo surgery to fix his problem.  Yet he easily physically outruns her, and outdoes her in physical presence throughout.  They are running down the culprit, and of course it is her cellphone that rings, and she stops to shut it off giving the culprit the opportunity to push past her.  Instead of showing she is fit for the top post by working harder to solve the crime, she simply exchanges snarky comments with the man who got the job.  The male detective, an outsider, is in hospital twice yet he still out-performs and out-thinks her to solve a crime in her own home town.  As is emphasized in the story line---she is too close and is too trusting of all her very nice friends, relatives, and neighbors.  At the end, she stomps and kicks the bad guy, says she wants to kill him, but later leaves town and runs away, abandoning the once again available top spot--stereotypic female dramatics.  A thoroughly depressing showing for the ladies--nothing inspiring here.  It is just too easy to depend upon a weak female lead for plot tension.  I'm so surprised BBC used that well-past-its-time crutch to bolster a crippled plot.And one more thing I don't see mentioned yet: the terrible music. It is so easy to take for granted good theme music and scores until one's ears are hurt by really poorly matched music.I literally RAN TO TURN OFF THE MUSIC AT THE END OF EACH EPISODE. I love all types of music but the music used here has nothing to do with bolstering the show's atmosphere or helping to set the scene.",2,I didn't care at all for this series.,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,2221,"['recommend', 'buying', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoying', 'first', 'one', 'trust', 'do', ""n't"", 'become', 'better', 'usually', 'love', 'BBC', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'one', 'way', 'Tennant', 'suspect', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'stating', 'negative', 'reviews', 'are', ""n't"", 'helpful', 'merely', 'have', 'crush', 'him.The', 'show', 'was', 'bogged', 'down', 'lots', 'slow-mo', 'So', 'many', 'undeveloped', 'characters', 'Motive', 'execution', 'reveal', 'crime', 'were', 'thoroughly', 'unconvincing', 'agree', 'what', 'most', '1-3', 'star', 'reviewers', 'wrote', 'it.I', 'add', 'objection', 'female', 'lead', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'strong', 'feminist', 'was', 'disgusted', 'character', 'performance', 'top', 'job', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'sick', 'ca', ""n't"", 'undergo', 'surgery', 'fix', 'problem', 'easily', 'physically', 'physical', 'presence', 'are', 'running', 'down', 'culprit', 'course', 'cellphone', 'shut', 'off', 'giving', 'culprit', 'opportunity', 'push', 'past', 'Instead', 'showing', 'fit', 'top', 'post', 'working', 'harder', 'solve', 'crime', 'simply', 'exchanges', 'snarky', 'comments', 'man', 'who', 'got', 'job', 'male', 'detective', 'outsider', 'hospital', 'twice', 'yet', 'still', 'out-performs', 'out-thinks', 'solve', 'crime', 'own', 'home', 'town', 'emphasized', 'story', 'line', '-she', 'too', 'close', 'too', 'trusting', 'very', 'nice', 'friends', 'relatives', 'neighbors', 'end', 'stomps', 'bad', 'guy', 'kill', 'later', 'town', 'away', 'abandoning', 'once', 'again', 'available', 'top', 'spot', 'stereotypic', 'female', 'dramatics', 'thoroughly', 'depressing', 'showing', 'ladies', 'nothing', 'inspiring', 'here', 'just', 'too', 'easy', 'depend', 'weak', 'female', 'lead', 'plot', 'tension', ""'m"", 'so', 'surprised', 'BBC', 'used', 'well-past-its-time', 'crutch', 'bolster', 'crippled', 'plot.And', 'one', 'more', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'mentioned', 'yet', 'terrible', 'music', 'so', 'easy', 'take', 'granted', 'good', 'theme', 'music', 'scores', 'one', 'ears', 'are', 'hurt', 'really', 'poorly', 'matched', 'music.I', 'literally', 'RAN', 'TO', 'TURN', 'OFF', 'THE', 'MUSIC', 'AT', 'THE', 'END', 'OF', 'EACH', 'EPISODE', 'love', 'types', 'music', 'music', 'used', 'here', 'nothing', 'do', 'bolstering', 'show', 'atmosphere', 'helping', 'set', 'scene']",Broadchurch - 3-DVD Set

But this particular series was very padded, predictable, and ultimately very disappointing. I guessed who the murderer was almost immediately and I'm not brilliant. The two leads are very good, as is generally the rest of the cast, particularly the actor playing Jack, who has a couple of very good scenes, and the actress playing Susan who is a complex character.The bickering between the two lead detectives is the best part of the series, and I would watch a Season 2 because of this, in hopes they create a better mystery for it.  The problems with this season are as follows: Too much time is spent on the grieving parents who have predictable reactions (a la The Killing season 1). The newspaper side plot was not very interesting. The fact that the dead boy was a friend of the lead female detective's son would have immediately been a conflict of interest and I doubt she would have been allowed to stay on as a lead investigator.The detective work is weak, and the behavior of the villain is not believable. They fail to follow up on promising leads just because the series needed to last for many episodes, and everyone in town needs to take turns acting suspiciously each week.Finally, despite the series initially being very circumspect regarding the boy's body in comparison to your typical gory American CSI-type show, they recreate his murder in a flashback that is gratuitous.",2,Disappointing (No spoilers),1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,1519,"['am', 'fan', 'British', 'mysteries', 'general', 'have', 'problem', 'slower-paced', 'series', 'take', 'time', 'develop', 'characters', 'particular', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'padded', 'predictable', 'ultimately', 'very', 'disappointing', 'guessed', 'who', 'murderer', 'was', 'almost', 'immediately', ""'m"", 'not', 'brilliant', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'generally', 'rest', 'cast', 'particularly', 'actor', 'playing', 'Jack', 'who', 'couple', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'actress', 'playing', 'Susan', 'who', 'complex', 'character.The', 'bickering', 'two', 'lead', 'detectives', 'best', 'part', 'series', 'would', 'watch', 'Season', '2', 'hopes', 'create', 'better', 'mystery', 'problems', 'season', 'are', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'grieving', 'parents', 'who', 'have', 'predictable', 'reactions', 'la', 'Killing', 'season', '1', 'newspaper', 'side', 'plot', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'fact', 'dead', 'boy', 'was', 'friend', 'lead', 'female', 'detective', 'son', 'would', 'have', 'immediately', 'been', 'conflict', 'interest', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'stay', 'lead', 'investigator.The', 'detective', 'work', 'weak', 'behavior', 'villain', 'not', 'believable', 'fail', 'follow', 'up', 'promising', 'leads', 'just', 'series', 'needed', 'last', 'many', 'episodes', 'everyone', 'town', 'needs', 'take', 'turns', 'acting', 'suspiciously', 'week.Finally', 'series', 'initially', 'being', 'very', 'circumspect', 'regarding', 'boy', 'body', 'comparison', 'typical', 'gory', 'American', 'CSI-type', 'show', 'recreate', 'murder', 'flashback', 'gratuitous']",Broadchurch - 3-DVD Set
1626286,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00BEEKN26,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 1]","I love British mystery series (and Australian ones too!) and have posted quite a few reviews of them here on Amazon. Those who have read my reviews know that I try to avoid &#8220;spoilers&#8221;.  After all, it wouldn&#8217;t be a mystery if you knew too many facts before watching a film or series.  This is especially the case with this terrific new DVD from eOne. The 8-part mini-series aired on BBC America (which I don&#8217;t get) and is now on DVD.  So far, it&#8217;s ranking as my favorite British mystery of 2014.The series was filmed in 2013 and (from one of the bonus features I learned that filming too from August to December 2012). There are eight episodes, each of which runs 45 to 52 minutes, since this was made for the commercial ITV network. So the whole series runs about 6 1/2 hours.  Though you can watch each episode at separate times, there are a few that almost require you to watch them together, because of the suspense. I&#8217;m not suggesting that you binge watch all six hours (though I guess you could) but I will suggest that you watch at least two at a time and  - to get the full emotional effect (and it will have an emotional effect on you) &#8211; you should watch episodes 7 and 8 together. And, because British commercial TV is more liberal than US networks, there is brief strong language and brief partial nudity.\So here we are in my third paragraph and I haven&#8217;t discussed the plot or the subject. Well, I can tell yiou this much: In a small community (Broadchurch) of 15,000 people on the coast of England, an 11 year-old boy is found dead on the beach (death caused by strangling). A detective (with a problematic past) comes down from Scotland to handle the case with a local female detective.  (All this happens in the first five minutes so it&#8217;s not a spoiler.) Over the next 59 days (that&#8217;s &#8220;story line&#8221; time, not viewing time &#8211; which is 6 hours) the two try to solve the murder.  This has always been a quiet and close community but nearly everyone has a &#8220;secret&#8221;.  The acting is so good that you&#8217;ll really have a hard time determining who the real killer is. And the script throws in lots of surprises. But, in the end, as I thought back over the clues that were revealed, it all made sense.  And I have to say the music added a lot.The DVD has a few special bonuses but, for probably the first time in the reviews I&#8217;ve posted, I can&#8217;t say that they added anything.  I guess the main reason is that the series draws you in so well that you really don&#8217;t want to know how they filmed it or to see the actors out of character. The first &#8220;bonus&#8221; is the now-requisite &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; featurette. This 27 minute bonus starts off with the first rehearsal where the actors are interviewed in a large, and VERY noisy, room, and you can hardly hear them.  And, as I said, they are all out of character which bothered me (it may not bother you). The other &#8220;bonus&#8221; is a series of &#8220;deleted scenes&#8221;. These are not long scenes &#8211; often less than a minute &#8211; and they are grouped by Episode number and total 27 minutes. Not only, did they not add anything to the story, but the images in these deleted scenes had a very light &#8220;contrast&#8221; in the image (as compared with the final images in the program). And, lastly there is the Trailer.So there you have it. I hope I have encouraged you to seek this DVD out and, yet not spoiled any of the enjoyment by telling you too much.  This &#8211; for me &#8211; was an undiscovered gem of a series&#62;I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",5,Brilliantly crafted British mystery &#8211; BUT PLEASE  don&#8217;t read &#8220;detailed&#8221; reviews with spoilers,1397347200,"04 13, 2014",2014,3729,"['love', 'British', 'mystery', 'series', 'Australian', 'ones', 'too', 'have', 'posted', 'few', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'know', 'try', 'avoid', '8220', 'spoilers', '8221', 'wouldn', '8217', 'be', 'mystery', 'knew', 'too', 'many', 'facts', 'watching', 'film', 'series', 'especially', 'case', 'terrific', 'new', 'DVD', 'eOne', '8-part', 'mini-series', 'aired', 'BBC', 'America', 'don', '8217', 'get', 'now', 'DVD', 'So', 'far', '8217', 's', 'ranking', 'favorite', 'British', 'mystery', '2014.The', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', '2013', 'one', 'bonus', 'learned', 'filming', 'too', 'August', 'December', '2012', 'are', 'eight', 'episodes', '45', '52', 'minutes', 'was', 'made', 'commercial', 'ITV', 'network', 'whole', 'series', '6', '1/2', 'hours', 'can', 'watch', 'episode', 'separate', 'times', 'are', 'few', 'almost', 'require', 'watch', 'together', 'suspense', '8217', 'not', 'suggesting', 'binge', 'watch', 'six', 'hours', 'guess', 'could', 'will', 'suggest', 'watch', 'least', 'two', 'time', 'get', 'full', 'emotional', 'effect', 'will', 'have', 'emotional', 'effect', '8211', 'should', 'watch', 'episodes', '7', '8', 'together', 'British', 'commercial', 'TV', 'more', 'liberal', 'US', 'networks', 'brief', 'strong', 'language', 'brief', 'partial', 'nudity.\\So', 'here', 'are', 'third', 'paragraph', 'haven', '8217', 'discussed', 'plot', 'subject', 'Well', 'can', 'tell', 'yiou', 'much', 'small', 'community', 'Broadchurch', '15,000', 'people', 'coast', 'England', '11', 'year-old', 'boy', 'found', 'dead', 'beach', 'death', 'caused', 'strangling', 'detective', 'problematic', 'past', 'down', 'Scotland', 'handle', 'case', 'local', 'female', 'detective', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', '8217', 'not', 'spoiler', 'next', '59', 'days', '8217', '8220', 'story', 'line', '8221', 'time', 'not', 'viewing', 'time', '8211', '6', 'hours', 'two', 'try', 'solve', 'murder', 'always', 'been', 'quiet', 'close', 'community', 'nearly', 'everyone', '8220', 'secret', '8221', 'acting', 'so', 'good', '8217', 'really', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'determining', 'who', 'real', 'killer', 'script', 'lots', 'surprises', 'end', 'thought', 'back', 'clues', 'were', 'revealed', 'made', 'sense', 'have', 'say', 'music', 'added', 'lot.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'special', 'bonuses', 'probably', 'first', 'time', 'reviews', '8217', 've', 'posted', 'can', '8217', 't', 'say', 'added', 'anything', 'guess', 'main', 'reason', 'series', 'so', 'well', 'really', 'don', '8217', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'filmed', 'see', 'actors', 'character', 'first', '8220', '8221', 'now-requisite', '8220', 'scenes', '8221', 'featurette', '27', 'minute', 'bonus', 'first', 'rehearsal', 'where', 'actors', 'are', 'interviewed', 'large', 'VERY', 'noisy', 'room', 'can', 'hardly', 'hear', 'said', 'are', 'character', 'bothered', 'may', 'not', 'bother', 'other', '8220', '8221', 'series', '8220', 'deleted', 'scenes', '8221', 'are', 'not', 'long', 'scenes', '8211', 'often', 'less', 'minute', '8211', 'are', 'grouped', 'Episode', 'number', 'total', '27', 'minutes', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'anything', 'story', 'images', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'had', 'very', 'light', '8220', 'contrast', '8221', 'image', 'compared', 'final', 'images', 'program', 'lastly', 'Trailer.So', 'have', 'hope', 'have', 'encouraged', 'seek', 'DVD', 'yet', 'not', 'spoiled', 'enjoyment', 'telling', 'too', 'much', '8211', '8211', 'was', 'undiscovered', 'gem', 'series', '62', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']",Broadchurch - 3-DVD Set

1626304,A2X4PCABYYDD94,B00BEEKN26,tychoryan,"[1, 1]","I went into this show expecting a standard police procedural that just happened to have David Tennant in it. Boy, was I taken by surprise.Focusing around the murder of an 11-year-old boy in a quiet sea-side town, Broadchurch follows not only the investigation into the boy's death, but the fallout to the entire community. A media circus ensues, and mob-mentality leads to further revelations and consequences.The show starts slow, reminiscent of the heavy focus on the anguish over Laura Palmer's murder in the first episode of &#34;Twin Peaks&#34;, but as the investigation continues, the time spent with all of these characters really pays off and allows us to be invested in their stories. By the time the season ends, it's hard not to feel something for everyone involved, which is lost in a lot of procedurals thanks to the standard 1-case-1-episode format that has characters coming and going all of the time. Here, we're living with these people for all 8 episodes. We know them. And we suspect everyone.David Tennant is great here, although written somewhat cliche as the gruff detective with a guilty secret seeking redemption. He gives his character some great (and much needed) humor as his out-of-touch-overtly-serious character is at odds with everyone, even/especially our other protagonist, Olivia Coleman's DS Miller. He really is an amazing actor, and he elevates what would have probably been an abrasive and annoying archetype otherwise.Coleman is the real star of this show. Her character is the emotional backbone of the series, as we see her initially naive and trusting nature (a product of the &#34;perfect sleepy town&#34; mentality) continually challenged by the revelations of the investigation. She's a detective who's never had to deal with investigating a murder, let alone the son of a dear friend. She knows the killer will be someone she knows, and that fear is gut-wrenching.No spoilers, but the story is surprising. Thankfully the plot doesn't revolve around a huge twist, but suffice to say it isn't predictable in the slightest.I'll stop there. I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a more dramatic and emotional investigative drama than the average show. I'll just warn that it's very heavy, despite the occasional funny bickering between Tennant and Coleman, and is not for anyone looking for a &#34;fun&#34; show.",5,A fantastic and multi-faceted Drama,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",2013,2364,"['went', 'show', 'expecting', 'standard', 'police', 'procedural', 'just', 'happened', 'have', 'David', 'Tennant', 'Boy', 'was', 'taken', 'surprise.Focusing', 'murder', '11-year-old', 'boy', 'quiet', 'sea-side', 'town', 'Broadchurch', 'not', 'only', 'investigation', 'boy', 'death', 'fallout', 'entire', 'community', 'media', 'circus', 'ensues', 'mob-mentality', 'leads', 'further', 'revelations', 'consequences.The', 'show', 'slow', 'reminiscent', 'heavy', 'focus', 'anguish', 'Laura', 'Palmer', 'murder', 'first', 'episode', '34', 'Twin', 'Peaks', '34', 'investigation', 'time', 'spent', 'characters', 'really', 'be', 'invested', 'stories', 'time', 'season', 'hard', 'not', 'feel', 'something', 'everyone', 'involved', 'lost', 'lot', 'procedurals', 'thanks', 'standard', '1-case-1-episode', 'format', 'characters', 'coming', 'going', 'time', 'Here', ""'re"", 'living', 'people', '8', 'episodes', 'know', 'suspect', 'everyone.David', 'Tennant', 'great', 'here', 'written', 'somewhat', 'cliche', 'gruff', 'detective', 'guilty', 'secret', 'seeking', 'redemption', 'character', 'great', 'much', 'needed', 'humor', 'out-of-touch-overtly-serious', 'character', 'odds', 'everyone', 'even/especially', 'other', 'protagonist', 'Olivia', 'Coleman', 'DS', 'Miller', 'really', 'amazing', 'actor', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'abrasive', 'annoying', 'archetype', 'otherwise.Coleman', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'character', 'emotional', 'backbone', 'series', 'see', 'initially', 'naive', 'trusting', 'nature', 'product', '34', 'perfect', 'sleepy', 'town', '34', 'mentality', 'continually', 'challenged', 'revelations', 'investigation', 'detective', 'who', 'never', 'had', 'deal', 'investigating', 'murder', 'let', 'alone', 'son', 'dear', 'friend', 'killer', 'will', 'be', 'someone', 'fear', 'gut-wrenching.No', 'spoilers', 'story', 'surprising', 'Thankfully', 'plot', ""n't"", 'revolve', 'around', 'huge', 'twist', 'suffice', 'say', ""n't"", 'predictable', 'slightest.I', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'there', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'more', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'investigative', 'drama', 'average', 'show', ""'ll"", 'just', 'warn', 'very', 'heavy', 'occasional', 'funny', 'bickering', 'Tennant', 'Coleman', 'not', 'anyone', 'looking', '34', 'fun', '34', 'show']",Broadchurch - 3-DVD Set
