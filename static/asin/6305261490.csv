456473,A2582KMXLK2P06,6305261490,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","Trees Lounge is hard to describe because it doesn't really stick to one specific genre.  The reason it doesn't stick to one specific genre is because it doesn't really do much of *anything*.  Plot development?  Yeah... if you wanna call it that.It's about Steve Buscemi playing the role of a guy who basically has no life, no ambition, no desire to succeed, etc.  He spends his days in the bar hitting on women, occasionally working on his cars or driving around in an ice cream truck, or getting into trouble with the fellows around town.Perhaps I'm so quick to forgive the storyline because it takes place in a small town making it very simple and relatable, and I simply love these kind of films.The humor is only sometimes funny, but the actual storyline is the reason Trees Lounge isn't getting a 5 star rating out of me.  Steve's character could certainly have been more interesting instead of being a lazy bum who has constant trouble scoring with the ladies.Spending all day getting to know numerous women around town isn't really appealing, and it eventually gets Steve in trouble (the best part of the movie, might I add).Overall, be cautious with this one.  You might find it boring if you believe character and plot development are crucial components required to make a movie watchable.",4,romantic comedy?

I loved it when I saw it a decade ago and my opinion has not changed in the time since. I rented it the other day and was as pleased as I was the first time around. Buscemi's virgin directorial effort could not have been more resonant. He portrays Tommy as both a hero and an anti-hero. The plot itself takes us to quite familiar places as there isn't anything too ""Hollywood"" about this production. It is not happy, but its realism offers great value.

Alcoholism is no joke, and the existance that some folks end up living in is a darkness that few understand. People don't grow up saying ""I'm gonna be an alcoholic some day"", but when you're in ""the pit"", this is what it looks like. I lived in a very similar state, and existance, and this movie struck a very special chord for me. You won't find the storyline focusing on recovery, it strictly shows you a guy after he's crossed the line, so to speak.

""Ghost World"" and the Coen Brothers is where his true iconoclastic spirit lies.  It should come as no surprise that he chose this slice-of-life serio-comedy for his directorial debut.  It should also be no surprise that the film is rich in characterization.  The story, however, is a little on the thin side.  No matter because Buscemi adds another trophy in his gallery of rogues and losers with his Tommy.  When Tommy isn't drinking he's stalking his ex-girlfriend who may or may not be carrying his kid.  The assumed father is Tommy's former boss who Tommy stole $1,500.00 from and gambled it away in Atlantic City.  To make Tommy more savory he carries on an illicit friendship with the niece of the ex-girlfriend.  Only an actor of Buscemi's calibre could make such a loser somewhat empathetic.  It's a fascinating character study trapped in a film that falls short of its intentions.  These flicks dealing with life's underbelly are indie cliche.

Tommy (Buscemi) hangs out at the Trees Lounge. He's an unemployed mechanic. His long time girlfriend is married to his ex-boss. She's pregnant and the baby might be his. He can't find a job, drinks more than he should and is trying, in general, to return to some degree of normalcy. The problem is, he keeps getting in his way.This is a nifty little flick. One of the coolest things is the cast. I don't know how much Bescemi had in the choosing but seeing a pre-fame Chloe Sevigny, Kevin Corrigan, Michael Imperioli, among others is a real hoot. The story is good. Tommy isn't a bad guy. He's just a screw up, and a selfish one at that. He would be in fine shape if he thought about the possible conseqences of his actions. Face it.

It sports some nifty 70s tunes and has a nice flow. It's very slice of life in that the viewer gets a snapshot of all the characters involved.

A loser, to be sure, but also a basically decent guy.

456483,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6305261490,Jeffrey Leach,"[43, 44]","Boy, am I glad I took the time to watch this movie! I suspect &quot;Trees Lounge,&quot; a low budget 1996 film directed, written, and starred in by veteran character actor Steve Buscemi, slipped under a lot of people's radar. What a shame. This film ranks as one of the best dramas I have seen in quite some time. Most people would probably recognize Buscemi from his many appearances in films ranging from the Adam Sandler vehicle &quot;Billy Madison&quot; to the dark comedy &quot;Ed and His Dead Mother.&quot; Well, Steve isn't putting on lipstick in this intense dark comedy about a New York loser and his relationships with like-minded souls living out their miserable existences at a neighborhood bar named Trees Lounge. I will never look at Steve Buscemi the same way after viewing this picture, and why this talented individual isn't getting more attention is beyond me. &quot;Trees Lounge&quot; is that good.Buscemi plays Tommy, a poor soul whose life spirals out of control day after day. He lost his job after taking some liberties with his employer's safe, lost his girlfriend to that same boss, cannot stop drinking to save his life, isn't above using drugs, and entangles himself in a relationship with the seventeen year old daughter of his former girlfriend's sister. Even worse, Tommy can't seem to land another job as a mechanic because his former employer badmouths him whenever someone calls for a reference. Tommy ultimately breaks down and takes a job as the driver of an ice cream truck, a position that causes more problems than solutions. He can't even pick up a girl at the bar without something bad happening. In a country where millions of people barely keep their heads above water, Tommy serves as an archetype of the lost soul. Arguably, his biggest problem stems from the fact that he blames everyone else for his own problems. Even when he approaches his former girlfriend with the intent to change for the better, he cannot do so without stating that he needs an external object to bring about that change (in this case, a child). In short, Tommy is afraid to look deep into his soul because he won't like what he will find there. Part of Tommy's problem rests on the fact that he lives above the bar, along with a few other losers like Billy, an old coot whose life melts away one drink at a time. By the end of the film, the viewer wonders whether Tommy will replace Billy at the bar and in life.&quot;Trees Lounge&quot; does display comedic elements from time to time, giving rise to a situation where you laugh at scenes you know you shouldn't be chortling over. For example, there is the scene where the daytime bartender at Trees Lounge bets Tommy ten dollars that he cannot walk out of the bar without taking a drink. Tommy sneers at such a ridiculous proposition, wisecracking his way around the issue until finally forced to take the bet. He starts to walk away with the money, quickly reaches for his drink, downs it, and runs out of the bar. While the scene brings a smile to your face, you know at the same time that you are watching a man with a serious alcohol problem who probably isn't going to seek help anytime soon. I found the disheveled drunk who can't seem to keep his family together but who owns a moving company and a fancy house amusing, although it is an amusement tempered with a sense of sorrow for his inability to communicate with his own family. &quot;Trees Lounge&quot; plays your emotions like a master violinist handling a priceless instrument.The supporting cast floating in and out of &quot;Trees Lounge&quot; staggers the mind. Chloe Sevigny, Debi Mazar, Daniel Baldwin, Mimi Rogers, Carol Kane, Samuel L. Jackson, and Anthony LaPaglia all appear in roles both major and minor. Buscemi must have called in a bunch of favors for his film, and the recognizable faces definitely provide the otherwise dreary atmosphere of Tommy's life with a little glitter. Sevigny especially shines as the flirty yet wise Debbie, the teenage girl who accompanies Tommy on his ice cream rounds and who helps bring down a whole lot of trouble for him.The DVD version promises a commentary by Steve Buscemi and a music video by one of the soundtrack groups, but the version I watched included none of these extras. That is unfortunate, too, because I would really like to hear what Buscemi says about this spectacular effort. Ultimately, &quot;Trees Lounge&quot; offers no definitive conclusions about Tommy's life, no concrete resolutions about where he will end up. In this way, the film mirrors real life where we cannot arrive at certainties from mere snapshots of a specific time in a person's existence. Who knows? Maybe Tommy will snap out of his malaise and finally live his life to the fullest, or maybe his doom sits right around the corner. Whatever the result, the fascinating &quot;Trees Lounge&quot; sits on a video store shelf near you awaiting your attentions.

The story centres around a bar, the Trees Lounge, in which Tommy (Buscemi)  hangs out and gets drunk with the other drunks.Many of the settings are  lifted from Buscemi's life before his acting career took off.Tommy  doesn't have a job, or a girl or a life. He managed to loose them all at  the same time. In their place, all that he has is an alcoholic haze. What  he really wants more than anything is to get those things back. Ideally,  he'd like the old job and girl but instead he finds himself driving an  ice-cream van and hooks up with the young neice of his ex.This does not  sound like a brilliant basis for a film and this movie's impact depends  almost exclusively on how the viewer relates to the main character Tommy.  If he is a shallow drunk with no merits beyond a quick intelligence then  the film will not appeal. On the other hand, if you find yourself wishing  him well and hoping that, somehow, he can get himself back together again  then you will enjoy this film.What makes this movie for me is that  Buscemi is seen in a role where you feel he really is playing a character  that he is close to.

Some filmmakers choose to ignore the first part and simply tell a story, one that may not be entertaining but still carries some sort of meaning, some sort of message, some sort of point. Some filmmakers choose to ignore the second part and simply entertain with action scenes, or special effects, or humor. It's a rare and tragic thing when a filmmaker ignores both parts and yet still manages to get a movie made, but Trees Lounge is one of these films-- aimless, pointless, and devoid of any entertainment.In this film, Steve Buscemi (who also wrote and directed this) does a fine job of acting as Tommy, a Long Island resident with no apparent aim in life other than to convince the world that he is the lowest form of human existence. He steals from his employer, he alienates his female childhood friend for the sake of brief sex, he alienates his older friends over the girl, he loses any other jobs he attempts to win, and ultimately his best friend beats him down with a baseball bat and leaves him lying alone in the dirt.And that, friends, is this film. There is no point to it, no reasoning behind it, no logic behind the assumption that we would want to follow this man as he completely ruins everything he touches and ultimately finds himself desolate and alone, hated by his friends, by his employer, and by us, the audience.

456492,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6305261490,Reviewer,"[15, 16]","Steve Buscemi has long been one of the premiere character actors in the business; his resume reads like a veritable Who's Who of interesting, complex characters who run the gamut from psycho hit-man to regular guy, all of whom he has brought vividly to life in film after film.  And whether or not a particular project is a hit or a flop, Buscemi is always good, and can always be counted upon to add that extra something to any given film, as he has in ""Trees Lounge,"" an affecting drama he not only stars in, but with which he makes his debut as a writer/director-- and an impressive debut it is.Tommy Basilio (Buscemi) is an out-of-work mechanic who lives alone above a bar called Trees Lounge in Long Island, N.Y.  He's more than a bit down on his luck; not only did he lose his job, but his pregnant girlfriend of eight years, Theresa (Elizabeth Bracco) recently dumped him for his former boss, Rob (Anthony LaPaglia).  He wants to pick himself up and get his life back together, but he doesn't seem to know where to start, and the garages to which he's applied for work aren't exactly knocking his door down to hire him.  So he gravitates to the Trees, where he can at least interact with others who seem to be in situations not entirely unlike his own, though at different stages and for different reasons.  But they all have one thing in common-- they're people just trying to get through the day; they're trying to get through life.  If they can only figure it all out.With this film, Buscemi proves that he is more than just a talented actor, but rather a true artist in every sense of the word, with his chosen medium being film.  He has an eye for detail which complements his insights into human nature and enables him to effectively translate his material to the screen.  His characters are finely drawn and complex, and with each and every one he manages to successfully avoid the stereotypes to which a setting like this could easily lend itself (and no doubt would, in lesser hands).  Even with the minor characters, he succinctly gives you enough of who they are that it allows you to see beneath the surface and know what makes them tick.  And he does it imaginatively-- by filling a room with photographs or items that reflect who a certain person is, for example, or simply by training his camera on someone's face and allowing that extra beat that affords the viewer a telling glimpse of what's hiding behind a character's eyes.  Buscemi has an innate sense of knowing how to convey what he's trying to say, and he does it in a million small and different ways that are subtle and incisive.  Simply put, he knows what works-- including how to get what he wants out of his actors-- and he presents it all with a pace and timing that are right on the mark.In Tommy, Buscemi creates a character to whom many will be able to relate and identify on any number of different levels.  To say that Tommy is a ""loser"" would be too much of a simplification, because the character is too complex for that tag alone to be accurate.  Tommy is blue-collar, down on his luck, and like so many people in real life, just can't seem to put it all together, can't figure out how ""life"" is supposed to work.  And that's what Buscemi conveys so subtly and so well, and it's the key to the success of this character-- it's what makes Tommy believable and real.  Obviously, Buscemi knew exactly what he wanted when he wrote this character, and he puts it across with a brilliant, memorable performance which also demonstrates his ability to star in and carry a movie on his own.  Certainly, he has a wonderful supporting cast that gives him plenty of help, but few character actors have ever been able to step into a lead role with such facility and achieve the level of success Buscemi has here.  And it's work that deserves to be acknowledged.There are a number of notable supporting performances in this film, as well, beginning with Mark Boone Junior, who as Mike captures the essence of a guy who is successful, but a loser nonetheless; LaPaglia, who gives a solid performance as Rob; Bracco, with a performance that is introspectively revealing; Debi Mazar, who with very little screen time leaves an indelible impression (and her eyes are absolutely mesmerizing); Kevin Corrigan (another of the finest character actors around), as Matthew; and especially Chloe Sevigny, as Debbie, Theresa's mature-beyond-her-years, seventeen-year-old niece.Rounding out the ensemble cast are Carol Kane (Connie), Bronson Dudley (Bill), Michael Buscemi (Steve's real life brother, playing Tommy's brother, Raymond), Suzanne Shepherd (Jackie), Rockets Redglare (Stan), Seymour Cassel (Uncle Al), Annette Arnold (Sandy), Michael Imperioli (George), Mimi Rogers (Patty), Daniel Baldwin (Jerry) and Charles Newmark (Puck).  An involving story presented with a rich assortment of memorable, convincing characters, ""Trees Lounge"" is a drama about life-- about the things going on in your own neighborhood, or downtown or two streets over, no matter where you are in the world.  Wherever people are, there are situations like the ones depicted in this film, problems that have to be solved and life that has to be lived.  And that's what makes this film so good; it gives the audience a chance to connect with, or at least examine, things that anyone anywhere will be able to recognize.  It may have taken a collaborative effort to make this one what it is, but in the end, it's Buscemi's film from start to finish, and a satisfying little gem of a movie it is.  And that's the magic of the movies.",4,Impressive Work by Steve Buscemi,1019174400,"04 19, 2002",2002,5579,"['Steve', 'Buscemi', 'long', 'been', 'one', 'premiere', 'character', 'actors', 'business',

He lives in a tiny apartment over a local dive named Tree's Lounge.  Tommy shows up everyday and knows all the regulars, specifically an old man named Bill who sits in his favorite seat all day, and an elderly couple who come in to gossip and play cards.  Tommy has recently lost his job as a mechanic for ""borrowing"" money from the business for gambling reasons.  He's bothering those who still work in the shop by hanging across the street, including ex-friend Rob who is now with Tommy's ex-girlfriend Teresa who's quite pregnant.  It's never sure if the baby is Rob's or Tommy's.Then appears a new guy in the bar, Mike.  He hangs out and drinks as regularly as the rest, but it turns out Mike has a family, wife and daughter, and a rather nice Moving Business that he runs from his barstool.  Mike and Tommy become friends, which doesn't stop Tommy from hitting Mike up for a job.  He's been cruising for mechanic work (while unable to keep his own car running) and finally takes a job running Uncle Al's Ice Cream Truck after Uncle Al suffers an unexpected and fatal heart attack.Debbie ""Deb"" (Played by Chloe Sevigny - Kids), related to Tommy though his past relationship with Teresa, helps Tommy run the truck, and though she's only seventeen they form a bond.  Jerry (Daniel Baldwin) and Patti (Mimi Rogers) are Deb's parents and still treat Tommy like family.  This puts his relationship with Deb, especially after it spins out of control, on the dark edge of friendship with what little family he has left.  Tommy is a disappointment with everyone, even Connie the bartender at Trees Lounge (played perfectly by Carol Kane) and he can't afford to loose family from wherever it comes fromThe most poignant scene in the film is Tommy sitting in Bill's regular chair after Bill has been taken to the hospital (and no one has gone to see him, not even his ""bar"" family), and you can see the look on Tommy's face wondering if he is becoming the next ""Bill"" in the bar.This film was written, directed by, and starring Steve Buscemi, one of my favorite actors.  The movie shows his talent doesn't lay in just acting alone.  It's a great story and beautifully directed.  The role of Tommy was (of course) written for Buscemi and he plays it to perfection.  You can clearly see Tommy's playful side, and why he's liked so much by his friends.  The film is surprisingly visual, capturing the way people look and act when they're under the influence or simply not taking care of themselves.  My only problem with the rental DVD I watched is that there were no subtitles for hard of hearing, and no extras on the DVD.  I bought it anyway, hoping for extras and possibly an interview with Steve Buscemi on the triple role he played in this movie.  I highly recommend this movie.

And many's the hum-drum film about which it could be said &quot;but  the scenery was breath-taking.&quot;  Tree Lounge has none of that going  for it, which means that Buscemi had his work cut out for him from the time  he first had an idea about making the film.The regular patrons of Trees  Lounge are an interesting mix.  Especially interesting are those who spend  their lives in the place--literally the entire day.  We have all heard that  &quot;even the dull and the ignorant have their story.&quot;  Buscemi  handles the  supporting characters by letting us see the puzzling story of  the one successful denizen, which leaves the viewer wondering what the  stories of the others may have been.Tommy, Buscemi's character, is the  irresponsible, anti-social but somehow engaging alcoholic we have all met  along the way.  He wants others to bond with him, but he is incapable of  holding up his end of any relationship.  Tommy's the sort who would be the  first to tell you that he never asked anybody to get hooked on him or to  trust in him.  Therefore, if anyone ever suffered the consequences for  doing so, it isn't his fault.  And he will be the first to tell you, too,  that he is not an alcoholic and that what drinking he does do hurts nobody  but himself.  And he didn't steal that $1500 from his employer; he just  borrowed it and was going to put it back after his successful (in the  planning stages) trip to Atlantic City.As the film cruises towards its  close, we see Tommy facing for perhaps the first time that he has had love  all his life, but he abused it until it became lost to him.  He tries to go  back to all the people who once cared for him, only to find them all too  hurt and burned out to want to be involved in his life anymore.  At the end  when Tommy seats himself in the barstool normally resolved for Trees'  oldest all-day drinker (who is then in the hospital dying [probably] alone  [definitely]), Buscemi's face is a study as the character seems to deeply  internize the double meaning of the words from the bartender and customers  who protest, &quot;Hey!  You're in Bill's seat.&quot;  Will he ever get out  of it?  Who knows?This is a story about little people in a little bar in  a little town--but it is a hugely satisfying film.

456500,A10E8BG7ZCGSPF,6305261490,Theodoros Natsinas,"[2, 2]","Drinking as a desperate attempt to overcome personal problems is quite a common theme in films. Since the 80s some films portray the drinker as an outcast, living almost alone in the universe (e.g. Barfly, Leaving Las Vegas). Their drinkers are existentialist alienated savants who cannot stand pretensions and conventions. They leave everything worldly (apart from alcohol) behind and end up somewhere so they can just drink themselves to death (Leaving Las Vegas again).Trees Lounge belongs in this tradition but with a major difference. This drinker, Tommy (Buscemi), is not alone, away from home, floating in space. He is firmly rooted on home ground. Tommy knows everybody around, since ever, and everybody knows him; he is surrounded by relatives, friends, ex-girlfriends, etc. The fact that Tommy is at his home town unfolds slowly (especially more so to a viewer not from the US). Buscemi's major achievement in directing this film is the way he deals with this, the story's central point: in a gradual, slow, painful and occasionally funny revelation.So, if one thinks that you end up alcoholic because you lose contact with a wider community the film shows someone ending up drunk despite being in community; can one speculate that it is because of this fact? The film doesn't apportion blame. We are never told why Tommy has ended up as a permanent resident of Trees Lounge. Was it the community? Was it the fun? Was it a character failing? But, for sure, if Trees Lounge is not a safe haven, neither is the community.I saw this film on the big screen when it came out and it was a superb and memorable experience. Recently I watched it again from a Region 1 DVD. As others have mentioned, this DVD is not a very satisfying offering; nothing like watching the film on the big screen. However, as by now the likelihood to come across the film in a cinema is low, you should definitely try the DVD; but one hopes that the production company will come up eventually with a better package.",5,Safe (?) haven,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,1996,"['Drinking', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'overcome', 'personal', 'problems', 'quite', 'common', 'theme', 'films', '80s', 'films', 'portray', 'drinker', 'outcast', 'living', 'almost', 'alone', 'universe', 'e.g', 'Barfly', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'drinkers', 'are', 'existentialist', 'alienated', 'savants', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'pretensions', 'conventions', 'leave', 'everything', 'worldly', 'apart', 'alcohol', 'end', 'up', 'somewhere', 'can', 'just', 'drink', 'death', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'again', 'Lounge', 'belongs', 'tradition', 'major', 'difference', 'drinker', 'Tommy', 'Buscemi', 'not', 'alone', 'away', 'home', 'floating', 'space', 'firmly', 'rooted', 'home', 'ground', 'Tommy', 'everybody', 'around', 'ever', 'everybody', 'surrounded', 'relatives', 'friends', 'ex-girlfriends', 'etc', 'fact', 'Tommy', 'home', 'town', 'unfolds', 'slowly', 'especially', 'more', 'so', 'viewer', 'not', 'US', 'Buscemi', 'major', 'achievement', 'directing', 'film', 'way', 'story', 'central', 'point', 'gradual', 'slow', 'painful', 'occasionally', 'funny', 'revelation.So', 'one', 'end', 'up', 'alcoholic', 'lose', 'contact', 'wider', 'community', 'film', 'someone', 'ending', 'up', 'drunk', 'being', 'community', 'can', 'one', 'speculate', 'fact', 'film', ""n't"", 'apportion', 'blame', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'why', 'Tommy', 'ended', 'up', 'permanent', 'resident', 'Trees', 'Lounge', 'Was', 'community', 'Was', 'fun', 'Was', 'character', 'failing', 'sure', 'Trees', 'Lounge', 'not', 'safe', 'haven', 'community.I', 'saw', 'film', 'big', 'screen', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'superb', 'memorable', 'experience', 'Recently', 'watched', 'again', 'Region', '1', 'DVD', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'DVD', 'not', 'very', 'satisfying', 'offering', 'nothing', 'watching', 'film', 'big', 'screen', 'However', 'now', 'likelihood', 'come', 'film', 'cinema', 'low', 'should', 'definitely', 'try', 'DVD', 'one', 'production', 'company', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'eventually', 'better', 'package']",Trees Lounge
