What a RUSH!I'm not saying it's perfect (5 stars not withstanding); the editing somehow gives the impression that matters are dragging along at a leisurely pace, whereas, of course, all hell is breaking loose in about 50 different ways.The shifty-eyed Rincewind is set (by the Patrician) to be nursemaid to the colorful Two Flower, who has just invented the genre of The Tourist on Discworld (the fantastic world invented by Terry Pratchett, which is shaped more or less like a rotating LP, with the water forever falling off the edge).  Meanwhile, a dastardly wizard is bent on rising to the top of the Unseen University (of Wizardry) by assassinating every wizard ahead of him. A mystery of cosmic proportions presents itself: why is the Giant Atuin, the enormous Turtle on whose back Discworld is supported, headed on a collision course with an enormous new star?Veteran Discworld afficionados will know that summarizing a Pratchett Plot is an exercise in futility.  Suffice it to note that all sorts of regulars are delightfully introduced, from the Patrician (Jeremy Irons, beatiful!) Cohen the Barbarian (Awesome!) The Luggage (Stupendous!!!) the Head Librarian (Er.  Ook?) and The Broken Drum.  There are transparent dragons, female heroes, and even an enormous Troll, and a floating mountain.  Sean Astin plays the accidental tourist, and does a beautiful job.I think the movie has been brilliantly designed and executed, even if Rincewind is occasionally mildly disconcerting, as though he isn't just an inept wizard, but actually teaches inept wizarding at an acting school.  Still, we must be grateful to David Jason (who portrays Rincewind) because he's one of the producers, and it really is a beautiful job at many levels.  The special effects are just beautifully effective.Some of the peculiarities of the movie are inherited from the book, I believe. The Color of Magic seems to have been the first of the Discworld books, and Discworld doesn't yet have the lived-in feel that the later books have. Where possible, the movie seems to improve on the book.  (Terry Pratchett himself appears as one of the wizards, in case you're interested. There is apparently an appearance by Granny Weatherwax, though I can't think where; possibly in the Rite of Spring).  The Inside Joke feeling some viewers might get is inevitable, since it's so difficult to present such a complex situation in each book, let alone a movie.  I wish they'd got a real Orang-utan, but that's probably asking too much.  (I thought I saw one in Hogfather, but maybe they just had a bigger primate budget.)  It's simple, mad entertainment, but it's probably best to watch it with someone familiar with Discworld, and a strong tranquilizer.Insanely recommended.  Two bananas up!Arch",5,Brilliant!

And of course, every fan has an image in his/her head of what a character should look and sound like. Fortunately for me, I was new to the Terry Pratchett universe and didn't have any expectations for this made-for-TV film. I was aware of some of the radical changes the producers made, but overall, I had a great time watching the Color of Magic and laughed out loud quite frequently. It is a hilarious sendup of everything we think of when we think about the fantasy genre, wizardry, and magic. After watching this, I became very interested in Pratchett's work and read up on Discworld mythology, so I disagree with the reviewers that this film is only interesting to existing Pratchett fans.For the uninitiated, Discworld is a flat disc-shaped world held up on the backs of four elephants, who in turn are standing on a giant turtle traveling through space, a parody of ancient world creation myths, medieval astronomy, and cosmology. The story starts in Ankh-Morpork, a fictional city that looks like a dirty, crowded, industrial-age/Victorian English port, with a bungling and overly ""mature"" wizard named Rincewind (David Jason) being kicked out of the Unseen University after 40 years of ineptitude at learning even the most basic of spells. Soon Discworld's first ever tourist, Twoflower, arrives in town and after a series of comical mishaps, Rincewind is tasked, on pains of death, with keeping the naive (and wealthy) traveler safe. For die-hard Pratchett fans, they'll hate Sean Astin (of Sam Gamgee fame fromThe Lord of the Rings) who is a white American being cast in the role of Twoflower, who is supposed to be Chinese and from the exotic ""Counterweight Continent"", home of a powerful and rich empire where the land is made of gold. His casting choice was supposedly due to a decision to bolster the film's international appeal, and I found him to be terribly miscast, never being able to shake from my mind his doofy look, naive simplicity, and demeanor from his LOTR character.For a made-for-TV movie, this film certainly feels like a much bigger budget film. The cast is filled with stars, though some only make minor appearances (like Jeremy Irons, who plays a lisp-afflicted Patrician). Tim Curry is particularly fun to watch as the hilariously evil and devious Trymon. Brian Cox is equally outstanding as the narrator, and Christopher Lee as the voice of Death. The CG is fantastic and rivals any Hollywood production, with some very lavishly detailed. The costumes and set designs are also very well done and believable.A highly entertaining and imaginative parody of the world and storytelling, I cannot recommend The Color of Magic strongly enough. For fans, it may be different from the book, but certain changes are required when translating to live action.

Anyone that enjoys fantasy, especially with some tongue in cheek humor will probably enjoy it. It reminds me a little of the better fantasy movies with a helping of some Monty Python type humor. I was drawn to rent this because I thoroughly enjoyed ""Hogfather"". This story revolves around what seems a normal traveller, well played by Sean Astin, that has somehow ended up in Discworld. He accompanies a bumbling wizard, played by David Jason, that is charged with the safe visit of the tourist and then trying to prevent the destruction of their world. Their adventures to see and then save Discworld are exciting and funny. Little comments about a chest with a ""wooden expression"", and ""I have a Wizard and I'm not afraid to use him"", sometimes might not be all caught the first time you watch it and add to the pleasure with repeat viewings. The wonderful cast includes Tim Curry as an evil wizard, Christopher Lee as Death, and Jeremy Irons as the Patrician. The costumes, sets, music, and special effects are quite good.

I'll admit that even though I did like the first two books, they did take a bit of getting used to the different writing style. They did change a few minor details as well as leave out one or two bits, but it doesn't diminish or take away from the overall storyline. I won't go into detail about the books due to the sheer detail and the fact that so many others have posted information about the books over the internet.The movie brings back David Jason who had previously been seen as Death's assistant Alfred in Sky 1's previous adaptation of Hogfather.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 2]","A live-action Terry Pratchett movie is either doomed to fail in every way, or succeed in practically everything.And ""The Colour of Magic,"" adapted from the first two novels in Pratchett's brilliant Discworld series, is more the former than the latter. This one is no ""Hogather"" -- it has rather slack direction at times -- but it preserves Pratchett's wry satirical sense of humour. And of course, it's all about a mercenary, cowardly failed wizard.Rincewind (David Jason) is ejected from the Unseen University, on the very day that Twoflower (Sean Astin) arrives with his many-legged Luggage. He's come to the Disc... to ""look at it."" But after Rincewind tries to con Twoflower, the Patrician (Jeremy Irons) orders Rincewind to be the guide/bodyguard of the Disc's first ever tourist.After a massive fire sweeps through the city, the two end up fleeing Ankh-Morpork and running into all sorts of weird things -- a very assertive magic sword, a floating island full of see-through dragons, a dramatic dragonlady in a leather bikini, astrozoologists trying to determine Great A'Tuin's gender, the aged Cohen the (retired) Barbarian, druids, and even getting thrown clear off the Disc in a strange spacecraft. And you thought YOU had problems.Unfortunately the Unseen University is having troubles of its own -- the magical book Octavo is acting weird, and power-hungry Trymon (Tim Curry) is scheming against the Archchancellor. Even worse, a strange red star has appeared in the sky, and the world is facing destruction. The only thing that can save it is the spell in Rincewind's head.Perhaps it's because it's based on the first, roughest Discworld books, but ""Colour of Magic"" is not quite as funny or tightly-written as its predecessor, ""Hogather."" The writing is not quite as complex or as witty, and the direction sometimes feels a bit slack (such as the bar fight scene, or Trymon skulking and schemind around the University).But despite these drawbacks, ""Colour of Magic"" is still a vastly entertaining story -- it has a solid plotline and it chugs away nicely after a somewhat sluggish beginning, and blossoms into full-out complexity about halfway through. Once it gets underway it starts to resemble a road-trip through fantasy-land, with our quirky tourist and wizard bungling their way across the Disc.Along the way there's some fun action (an upside-down duel), humorous dialogue (""You weren't born with a mysterious birthmark in the shape of a crown, were you?""), and a general air of tongue-in-cheekness. Best of all, it's a fantasy spoof -- Vadim Jean preserves Pratchett's clever satire aimed at the staples of your average fantasy: fantasy babes, prophecies, magic swords, retired barbarians, powerful artifacts, and even the idea of reality warping itself to save the ""hero.""Jason is wonderfully snivelly and sour as Rincewind, a failed wizard who basically finds himself repeatedly swept up into bizarre, deadly circumstances even though he didn't want to be involved. Astin is even better as the hilariously oblivious Twoflower, who regards every disaster as yet another great adventure (""We're going to run out of world!"" ""I have to see that!"").And there's a talented supporting cast -- Curry chews the scenery with sneering aplomb, Karen David plays a humorously over-the-top dragon-lady, and Irons has a small but wonderful role as the chilly, efficient Vetinari. And of course, the brilliant Christopher Lee takes over as an increasingly disappointed Death.""Colour of Magic"" isn't as tightly directed as it could have been, but it still manages to be clever and quite amusing.",4,"He's a hero, isn't he?",1238544000,"04 1, 2009",2009,3601,"['live-action', 'Terry', 'Pratchett', 'movie', 'either', 'doomed', 'fail', 'way', 'succeed', 'practically', 'everything.And', 'Colour', 'Magic', 'adapted', 'first', 'two', 'novels', 'Pratchett', 'brilliant', 'Discworld', 'series', 'more', 'former', 'latter', 'one', 'Hogather', 'rather', 'slack', 'direction', 'times', 'Pratchett', 'wry', 'satirical', 'sense', 'humour', 'course', 'mercenary', 'cowardly', 'failed', 'wizard.Rincewind', 'David', 'Jason', 'ejected', 'Unseen', 'University', 'very', 'day', 'Twoflower', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'many-legged', 'Luggage', 'come', 'Disc', 'look', 'Rincewind', 'con', 'Twoflower', 'Patrician', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'orders', 'Rincewind', 'be', 'guide/bodyguard', 'Disc', 'first', 'ever', 'tourist.After', 'massive', 'fire', 'sweeps', 'city', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'fleeing', 'Ankh-Morpork', 'running', 'sorts', 'weird', 'things', 'very', 'assertive', 'magic', 'sword', 'floating', 'island', 'full', 'see-through', 'dragons', 'dramatic', 'dragonlady', 'leather', 'bikini', 'trying', 'determine', 'Great', ""A'Tuin"", 'gender', 'aged', 'Cohen', 'retired', 'Barbarian', 'druids', 'even', 'getting', 'thrown', 'clear', 'Disc', 'strange', 'spacecraft', 'thought', 'had', 'problems.Unfortunately', 'Unseen', 'University', 'having', 'troubles', 'own', 'magical', 'book', 'Octavo', 'acting', 'weird', 'power-hungry', 'Trymon', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'scheming', 'Archchancellor', 'Even', 'worse', 'strange', 'red', 'star', 'appeared', 'sky', 'world', 'facing', 'destruction', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'save', 'spell', 'Rincewind', 'head.Perhaps', 'based', 'first', 'roughest', 'Discworld', 'books', 'Colour', 'Magic', 'not', 'quite', 'funny', 'tightly-written', 'predecessor', 'Hogather', 'writing', 'not', 'quite', 'complex', 'witty', 'direction', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'slack', 'such', 'bar', 'fight', 'scene', 'Trymon', 'skulking', 'schemind', 'University', '.But', 'drawbacks', 'Colour', 'Magic', 'still', 'vastly', 'entertaining', 'story', 'solid', 'plotline', 'away', 'nicely', 'somewhat', 'sluggish', 'beginning', 'blossoms', 'full-out', 'complexity', 'halfway', 'underway', 'resemble', 'road-trip', 'fantasy-land', 'quirky', 'tourist', 'wizard', 'bungling', 'way', 'Disc.Along', 'way', 'fun', 'action', 'upside-down', 'duel', 'humorous', 'dialogue', 'were', ""n't"", 'born', 'mysterious', 'birthmark', 'shape', 'crown', 'were', 'general', 'air', 'tongue-in-cheekness', 'Best', 'fantasy', 'spoof', 'Vadim', 'Jean', 'Pratchett', 'clever', 'satire', 'aimed', 'staples', 'average', 'fantasy', 'fantasy', 'babes', 'prophecies', 'magic', 'swords', 'retired', 'barbarians', 'powerful', 'artifacts', 'even', 'idea', 'reality', 'warping', 'save', 'hero', 'Jason', 'wonderfully', 'snivelly', 'sour', 'Rincewind', 'failed', 'wizard', 'who', 'basically', 'repeatedly', 'swept', 'up', 'bizarre', 'deadly', 'circumstances', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'involved', 'Astin', 'even', 'better', 'hilariously', 'oblivious', 'Twoflower', 'who', 'disaster', 'yet', 'great', 'adventure', ""'re"", 'going', 'run', 'out', 'world', 'have', 'see', '.And', 'talented', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Curry', 'scenery', 'sneering', 'aplomb', 'Karen', 'David', 'humorously', 'over-the-top', 'dragon-lady', 'Irons', 'small', 'wonderful', 'role', 'chilly', 'efficient', 'Vetinari', 'course', 'brilliant', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'over', 'increasingly', 'disappointed', 'Death', 'Colour', 'Magic', ""n't"", 'as', 'tightly', 'directed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'still', 'be', 'clever', 'quite', 'amusing']",Terry Pratchett's The Colour of Magic: A Spellbinding Adventure

But, truth is, the first two Discworld novels aren't anywhere near to being my favorites. It wasn't until the fourth and fifth entries (MortandSourcery) that I really started getting into the series. Maybe it's because I never was too fond of Twoflower, whose obliviousness was so pronounced that as a main character he simply lacked depth and believability; and this then made me not invest so much into the story. In later books, Pratchett would continue to hone his satirical thrusts, but he would also make you deeply care about the characters. So, no, Twoflower didn't do much for me. On the other hand, his murderous multi-legged Luggage became instantly all sorts of awesome. Carved out of rare sapient pearwood, the Luggage exuded chunks of personality, never mind that its preferred expression is... wooden.This two-part tele-film adaptation actually combines the novels THE COLOUR OF MAGIC and its direct sequel THE LIGHT FANTASTIC. I'm trying strenuously to be objective in rating this movie, but it's hard going. Terry Pratchett ranks as one of my all-time favorite writers, and, as a serious fan of Discworld, a live action adaptation still counts as monumental news to me. THE COLOR OF MAGIC is more accessible than (if not as good as)Hogfather. With THE COLOR OF MAGIC you don't have to be as in the know and the spoofing is more obvious. It's a must-see for Discworld addicts, especially since these adapted two novels form the launching points of the series. But will the rest of the viewing audience like it? Probably. Hopefully. Or it could be my Discworld myopia talking.On the shell of the enigmatic world turtle Great A'Tuin stand four colossal elephants, and on their backs lies the Discworld, an improbable place where ""hubwards"" and ""rimwards"" happen to be legitimate navigational directions. Focus in on the bustling city of Ankh-Morpork and narrow your gaze at the magical Unseen University, home of mighty wizards and Rincewind.There are eight levels of Wizardry. In his forty years spent in the Unseen University, Rincewind - Discworld's most hapless and cowardly wizard (but he spells it ""wizzard"") - has yet to achieve even one level. At last Rincewind finds himself expelled for sheer incompetence, and off he goes. He promptly lands a gig as guide to the amiable Twoflower, Discworld's very first tourist.Back in the Unseen University, skullduggery. It seems the speediest way to advance in the wizardly profession is thru assassination of one's immediate superior and the assumption of certain articles of his wardrobe. Thus, sporting new pointy shoes and hat signals sudden career upward mobility. One of the wizards, Trymon, is played to wicked smarmy perfection by Tim Curry and, glimpsing him, it quickly dawns on the viewer that someone or possibly several someones simply won't make it thru the film breathing. Even more dire, the Octavo - the greatest spellbook of all - is getting antsy and rattling its chains (yes, it's chained up!). One of its Eight Great Spells has gone missing and the absence is causing great turmoil at the University. Trymon, though, sees it as an opportunity.But, mostly, the film chronicles the misadventures of Rincewind and Twoflower. Twoflower insists on seeing all the sights, which causes no end of concern for Rincewind who, as mentioned, is a champion coward. If there were a course for Running Away... well, there isn't, but he would've done really well in class. There's a rambling feel, an episodic sense, to the first part of the film as Rincewind and Twoflower just seem to trudge along, one crazy predicament after another. That they keep on surviving is due some to fortunate bumbling and also to that one spell skulking in Rincewind's memory. Yes, Rincewind possesses one spell. But he doesn't really know what it does.There's also a subplot involving a scientific expedition which sets out to learn the Great A'Tuin's gender, the knowing of which is vital for some unexpressed but probably very important reason. As one astrozoologist asks: ""So we're gonna look at the turtle's bottom?""And is that the Great A'Tuin inscrutably wending its way closer and closer towards a fiery red star? The people start to panic, as the star looms larger and larger. The Discworld needs a hero. Rincewind would please like to run away and fetch one. The story tightens up in the second part of the film, as Rincewind and Twoflower get caught up in a world-saving quest. So it's probably for the best that they run into Discworld's greatest warrior Cohen the Barbarian. Cohen has been in the hero business for eight decades, so it shouldn't be a surprise that the gent is now a geriatric. But he's still savvy. But savvy and toothless.THE COLOR OF MAGIC has its share of parodies, satiric barbs, and all-around silliness, and mostly they're not so subtle. There's an overenthusiastic enchanted sword which bullies Rincewind into heroic acts (this is NOT appreciated by Rincewind). There's some gouge-me-in-the-eye-it's-so-awful wordplay regarding insurance policies, and the silly difference between the circumference and the circumfence (they both run around the edges of Discworld).No problems at all with the acting. I don't know David Jason from Jason David, but he's pretty decent as Rincewind, although my sense was that the Rincewind in the novels was more robust. Sean Astin plays Twoflower, and he does a small wonder by making me like Discworld's first ever tourist. Tim Curry smiles and scowls, and both expressions are oily and pregnant with stab-you-in-the-back innuendos. One of my favorite characters in the Discworld series is Death, and he drops in for several humorous visits, usually timed whenever Rincewind is in mortal peril. And it's sweeeet that Christopher Lee provides Death's sepulchral voice. The best cameo, though, falls to Jeremy Irons. He shows up for half a mo as Lord Vetinari, the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork. The austere and despotic (but in a good way) Patrician is another of my favorites, and Irons truly does him justice. Also, author Terry Pratchett briefly moonlights as an astrozoologist, and it's absolutely fitting that he gets in the last word. Oh, and Brian Cox is quite good as the film narrator.THE COLOR OF MAGIC doesn't have the scope of a big budget production, and yet the special effects are quite forgiveable and very much on par with what I expect from tele-films. It helps that the tone of the film is so very much nudge in the ribs. THE COLOR OF MAGIC, originally broadcasted in the U.K. in 2008, is presented in widescreen format on DVD. It runs at 197 minutes, so pack a lunch. In the Absolutely-No-Bonus-Features Department, the DVD comes with absolutely no bonus features.The movie stays fairly true to the source material, but there are key omissions. If you've recently read THE LIGHT FANTASTIC, it'll hit you that the creepy things from the Dungeon Dimensions which, in the book, managed to burst thru into Discworld's reality, well, they don't do that in the movie. They don't even show up. We also miss out on a cameo from Ysabell, Death's adopted daughter (and future mother of the fabulous Susan Sto Helit). But, at least, we're treated to the Librarian, in both his pre-simian and then simian forms.I'm stoked that the next Discworld project is bringingGoing Postal (Discworld)to the cinema, and I can't wait to see how con artist Moist von Lipwig is rendered onscreen. But I'm really waiting on Death (a.k.a. Bill Door) or Commander Vimes & the City Watch to be featured as the central characters in future flicks. Sweet Oogly Moogly, may it be so!

1186067,A15Y2FQ5WNR63Y,B001EM1E94,"James D. DeWitt ""Alaska Fan""","[5, 5]","The Color of Magicwas the very first Discworld novel, published in 1983.The Light Fantastic: A Discworld Novel, a direct sequel, and the second Discworld tale, was published in 1986. Pratchett's writing and plotting are better by several orders of magnitude in his later books. And the later books are less overtly satiric. The highly episodic nature of these first two novels must have made them tough to script. But, over all, this is a decent effort at a difficult task.The casting is generally good. Sean Astin is quite good as Twoflower, the Disc's first tourist. He was a controversial choice because Twoflower is from the Discworld's equivalent of China in the hearts of Pratchett fans, but Astin brings such strong skills to the role that it all works well. David Jason as the failed wizard - excuse me, ""Wizzard"" - is less successful. He's simply too old. And the script down plays Rincewind's strongest trait: cowardice. This is a man who knows how to say ""Don't kill me"" in a hundred different languages. Jason just doesn't fit the character. Jeremy Irons is superb as the Patrician. David Bradley as Cohen is at once not old enough and too old. He is obviously much younger than the 92 years Cohen claims. He tries to ""act"" older by being slower in fights, something that would surely have killed Cohen long ago if it were right. Tim Curry is completely right as the power-hungry, scheming Trymon, a larger role in the movie than in the books.Another problem is that Color of Magic/Light Fantastic cries out for a big special effects budget. Let's just say that The Mob, the movie's producers, didn't have Peter Jackson's budget. Except, perhaps, for the Librarian, they do reasonably well with what they had, and the final few scenes are especially good.Still, even a so-so Pratchett movie is still a Pratchett movie. If all of the jokes aren't there, and some destinations skipped or somewhat changed, there are enough laughs to remind you why Pratchett is a world treasure.Reportedly, The Mob will makeGoing Postalnext, a much later, much better written Pratchett novel. I look forward to it, but in the meantime Color of Magic, if flawed, is still great fun. And the flaws may just be, like octarine, the color of magic, a pigment of my imagination.

1186073,A2SH7OWE8QJYNC,B001EM1E94,Kaleidocherry,"[4, 5]","I never really liked The Color of Magic and The Light Fantastic much.  IMHO they are the weakest of all the Discworld books, and that's certainly understandable since they were the first two published.  So when I saw the well-produced Hogfather movie and liked it, then learned The Color of Magic was made into a movie also, I decided to take a chance.  I expected the weak Color of Magic story and the Hogfather-level production values and acting quality.Well, as to production values this is not too bad.  We certainly see a lot of Rincewind closeups for long periods, sometimes to the detriment of other characters or situations that could use a little exploring (Cohen, Twoflower, the dragon home, etc.).  I feel that David Jason was much too old to play the Rincewind of this era, who is supposed to be about 30; Jason looks his age (68) in this.  If they can make a 54-year-old Alan Rickman look like a 30-year-old Snape, they could make Jason look younger too.  The sets are good, but the overall pacing feels too slow.  Note that this is a 2-parter, each part being 90 minutes.  I feel the whole thing could have been done more successfully as a one-part 2-hour movie, if they had only picked up the pace (not cutting anything out).Now as to the acting:  At first glance it seems Jason is overdoing it, but Rincewind is an over-the-top character, so that's OK.  Where I had problems was with Sean Astin, who seemed to be trying to out-American himself and put all memories of the word ""Hobbit"" firmly out of everyone's minds, and Tim Curry, who plowed through this woodenly, his so-called ""evil grin"" more a rictus of discomfort.  It seemed as though he were gritting his teeth in frustration the whole time.  It is perhaps due to the fact that there were a lot of camera shots zoomed in on characters' faces (including Cohen and Bethany) where the camera seemed to be held too long.  It makes them appear as though they're just looking woodenly (I hate to repeat myself) off into space.So, there are some pieces of this whole that didn't quite fit, and for that reason I give it only 3 stars.  But I also consider the material flawed.  I'm hoping more Discworld books make it to the screen, with actors who are committed to doing Oscar-quality work.",3,Not as good as Hogfather,1250985600,"08 23, 2009",2009,2258,"['never', 'really', 'liked', 'Color', 'Magic', 'Light', 'Fantastic', 'much', 'are', 'weakest', 'Discworld', 'books', 'certainly', 'understandable', 'were', 'first', 'two', 'published', 'when', 'saw', 'well-produced', 'Hogfather', 'movie', 'liked', 'then', 'learned', 'Color', 'Magic', 'was', 'made', 'movie', 'also', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'expected', 'weak', 'Color', 'Magic', 'story', 'Hogfather-level', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'quality.Well', 'production', 'values', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'certainly', 'see', 'lot', 'Rincewind', 'closeups', 'long', 'periods', 'sometimes', 'detriment', 'other', 'characters', 'situations', 'could', 'use', 'little', 'exploring', 'Cohen', 'Twoflower', 'dragon', 'home', 'etc.', 'feel', 'David', 'Jason', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'Rincewind', 'era', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', '30', 'Jason', 'age', '68', 'can', 'make', '54-year-old', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'look', '30-year-old', 'Snape', 'could', 'make', 'Jason', 'look', 'younger', 'too', 'sets', 'are', 'good', 'overall', 'pacing', 'feels', 'too', 'slow', 'Note', '2-parter', 'part', 'being', '90', 'minutes', 'feel', 'whole', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'more', 'successfully', 'one-part', '2-hour', 'movie', 'had', 'only', 'picked', 'up', 'pace', 'not', 'cutting', 'anything', 'out', '.Now', 'acting', 'first', 'glance', 'Jason', 'overdoing', 'Rincewind', 'over-the-top', 'character', 'OK.', 'Where', 'had', 'problems', 'was', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'trying', 'out-American', 'put', 'memories', 'word', 'Hobbit', 'everyone', 'minds', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'who', 'plowed', 'woodenly', 'so-called', 'evil', 'grin', 'more', 'rictus', 'discomfort', 'seemed', 'were', 'gritting', 'teeth', 'frustration', 'whole', 'time', 'perhaps', 'due', 'fact', 'were', 'lot', 'camera', 'shots', 'zoomed', 'characters', 'including', 'Cohen', 'Bethany', 'where', 'camera', 'seemed', 'be', 'held', 'too', 'long', 'appear', ""'re"", 'just', 'looking', 'woodenly', 'hate', 'repeat', 'off', 'space.So', 'are', 'pieces', 'whole', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'reason', 'give', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'also', 'consider', 'material', 'flawed', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'more', 'Discworld', 'books', 'make', 'screen', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'committed', 'doing', 'Oscar-quality', 'work']",Terry Pratchett's The Colour of Magic: A Spellbinding Adventure

1186078,A2UQKHJOTE0UW1,B001EM1E94,MarsTwain,"[4, 5]","I love Terry Pratchett. I even love most of the actors in this film but I agree with the folks who didn't think this works: it doesn't. The portrayal of Rincewind is quite good and Cohen is effortless. Everyone else is less than successful.I think it's because in order to properly play a Pratchett character, you have to be a character actor. Sean Astin, a great talent, is great for playing realistic characters. His Twoflower is dreadful. The stilted I'm-reading-lines delivery is like summerstock quality acting. From Astin, this was both a shock and a real disappointment. I didn't even care that he's not Asian like Twoflower is supposed to be: he just isn't good. Most of the cast are like this. Tim Curry plays Tim Curry, as always, so it didn't feel at all like Pratchett. Just felt like Tim Curry. A few of the side characters do very well but the material is not well-scripted. Somehow the translation got from page to script without any of the timing that makes the humor work. Lines are slowly said, huge pauses grow between the question and response...the editing and timing just sucked the film dry. Visually they did very well on a TV budget but certain elements jar: elaborate velvet robes on the wizards work but putting Rincewind in a button-down oxford shirt under it made it seem again like amateur theater. It takes you completely out of the moment.  another example is a huge overuse of one 20' wall set of the Unseen University: you see it so much, you realize they built just this tiny peice and it again takes you out of the moment. Also it's boring. Likewise a lot of fans must have been used for crowd scenes: it shows obviously.Because it's made for TV, the FX are sort of mediocre. The dragon fight hanging upside down apparently was terribly hard to film and that's too bad: it's cropped so close and cut up so much it's impossible to follow what's supposed to be happening. The action sequences are so clunky and slow that I suspect the director is at fault for much of this; there's just zero tension. Any movie involving Rincewind is mostly action as he spends his life running. Somehow, there's no speed to any of this production. It's just slow, choppy, akward.And like Hogfather, if you aren't already aware of Discworld, nothing is explained to you, which leaves half the elements feeling like in-jokes. Why did Vetinari have to have his little dog? Anyone not a fan wouldn't know the difference and any fan would know we've never seen him with the dog. It's a good example of a detail included for the fan-base that is superflous and inaccurate. It's almost insulting--if you don't know about it, you don't need it and if you do, it's wrong. Jeremy Irons' Vetinari is actually pretty good though the lisp was annoying but again, script pacing and timing of pretty much everything needed to be rethought and re-edited. It would've been 40 minutes shorter but maybe it would've been good.

In this case, the movie is based on the first two novels in the 'Discworld' series, 'The Colour of Magic' and 'The Light Fantastic'.Rincewind (David Jason), an inept wizard, is expelled from Unseen University. On a dare, he snuck a look at the Octavo, the book used to create the world, and one of the eight great spells lodged in his head.At the same time, Twoflower (Sean Astin) arrives in Ankh-Morpork to ""look at it"".  He's the Discworld's first tourist and he travels with the Luggage, a box made of sapient pearwood that moves about on hundreds of little legs and will follow it's owner everywhere.After conning Twoflower, Rincewind is dragged to the Patrician's palace and ordered by Lord Vetinari (Jeremy Irons) to guide Twoflower safely through the city.Twoflower, introducing the concept of fire insurance to Ankh-Morpork, inadvertently causes the entire city to burn down and he and Rincewind escape and Rincewind is plunged into several life threatening situations which he survives by sheer luck.The good parts of this movie are Jeremy Irons as the Patrician and Tim Curry as Ymper Trymon, second in command of one of the eight orders of wizardry at the university. Both play their roles with relish and Curry's performance is as good, if not better, than that of Cardinal Richelieu in 'The 3 Musketeers'.The bad parts? Well, a lot of the good scenes in both novels are left out. There is no travelling shop, no Hrun the Barbarian, no flying rock and no Tethis the sea troll. There is also no gingerbread cottage or broomstick flying.Also, they unfortunately chose a white actor to portray Twoflower, when it's made clear in both 'The Colour of Magic' and 'Interesting Times' that Twoflower is Chinese. A real shame, but Sean Astin does a fantastic job at portraying Twoflower's attitude of looking at the world through rose coloured glasses.And they got Cohen the Barbarian's (David Bradley) teeth wrong.Although this movie takes a while to get going, it does get funnier as it goes along and there are some great one-liners.  ""I am having a near Rincewind experience.""Christopher Lee reprises the voice of Death, as he did in the animated versions of 'Soul Music' and 'Wyrd Sisters' and he has some of the best parts in the movie.Aside from the little annoyances, the movie is quite good, the actors are superb, it's got all the wittiness you'd expect from Pratchett, and I loved it.",4,You in-sewered the Drum?,1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,2502,"['second', 'attempt', 'make', 'movie', 'Terry', 'Pratchett', 'novel', 'rather', 'well', 'case', 'movie', 'based', 'first', 'two', 'novels', ""'Discworld"", 'series', 'Colour', 'Magic', 'Light', ""Fantastic'.Rincewind"", 'David', 'Jason', 'inept', 'wizard', 'expelled', 'Unseen', 'University', 'dare', 'snuck', 'look', 'Octavo', 'book', 'used', 'create', 'world', 'one', 'eight', 'great', 'spells', 'lodged', 'head.At', 'same', 'time', 'Twoflower', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'Ankh-Morpork', 'look', 'Discworld', 'first', 'tourist', 'Luggage', 'box', 'made', 'sapient', 'pearwood', 'hundreds', 'little', 'legs', 'will', 'follow', 'owner', 'everywhere.After', 'conning', 'Twoflower', 'Rincewind', 'dragged', 'Patrician', 'palace', 'ordered', 'Lord', 'Vetinari', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'guide', 'Twoflower', 'safely', 'city.Twoflower', 'introducing', 'concept', 'fire', 'insurance', 'Ankh-Morpork', 'inadvertently', 'entire', 'city', 'burn', 'down', 'Rincewind', 'escape', 'Rincewind', 'plunged', 'several', 'life', 'threatening', 'situations', 'sheer', 'luck.The', 'good', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Patrician', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Ymper', 'Trymon', 'second', 'command', 'one', 'eight', 'orders', 'wizardry', 'university', 'play', 'roles', 'relish', 'Curry', 'performance', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'Cardinal', 'Richelieu', '3', ""Musketeers'.The"", 'bad', 'parts', 'Well', 'lot', 'good', 'scenes', 'novels', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'travelling', 'shop', 'Hrun', 'Barbarian', 'flying', 'rock', 'Tethis', 'sea', 'troll', 'also', 'gingerbread', 'cottage', 'broomstick', 'flying.Also', 'unfortunately', 'chose', 'white', 'actor', 'portray', 'Twoflower', 'when', 'made', 'clear', ""'The"", 'Colour', 'Magic', ""'Interesting"", 'Times', 'Twoflower', 'Chinese', 'real', 'shame', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'fantastic', 'job', 'portraying', 'Twoflower', 'attitude', 'looking', 'world', 'rose', 'coloured', 'glasses.And', 'got', 'Cohen', 'Barbarian', 'David', 'Bradley', 'movie', 'while', 'get', 'going', 'get', 'funnier', 'along', 'are', 'great', 'one-liners', 'am', 'having', 'near', 'Rincewind', 'experience', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'voice', 'Death', 'did', 'animated', 'versions', ""'Soul"", 'Music', 'Sisters', 'best', 'parts', 'movie.Aside', 'little', 'annoyances', 'movie', 'quite', 'good', 'actors', 'are', 'superb', 'got', 'wittiness', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Pratchett', 'loved']",Terry Pratchett's The Colour of Magic: A Spellbinding Adventure

A strange disjointedness takes over and for those who haven't read the books - there is no hope to follow the tale.  For those who have read the books - they are changed, warped and some of our favorite parts are removed.Though ""Hogfather"" was no awardwinner, it was faithful to the book and held a certain charm that lovers of the series will be thrilled with.  The Color of Magic sadly lacks this charm.  Through no fault of the excellent cast - Discworld never comes to life in this film.  Perhaps it is the rushed condensing of two books into one film, or perhaps it is as simple as Pratchett's humor not translating properly to the new medium.Each of the characters seems close enough to what we envisioned... but they seem to wander hopelessly through the scenery with little direction and even less purpose.  Important scenes like - the trolls on the mountain are cut down to almost nothing with no explination at all.  When Cohen finally gets his dentures, there is no reason for them to sparkle because it is never said that troll's teeth are made of diamonds.  The luggage is almost forgotten and becomes simply a mobile set piece.  The scenes at the Dragon's castle are pointless and the concept of the imaginary dragons coming to life is passed over completely - making the disappearance of the dragon rather odd to the viewer.  The scene with Bel Sham Haroth is completely left out, as well as the card game with Twoflower, War, Famine, Pestilence and Death.In all, the scenes with the greatest opportunities for humor were cut, and those that were left were patched together with no rhyme or reason.  Sadly I cannot recommend this movie, though avid Discworld fanatics will still go out of their way to watch it... just know that there is not a lot here to cling to.Easily a PG rating - my 7 year old watched it with us and seemed to enjoy it, though he didn't ask if we could ""keep it"" like he normally does.",3,So sad....,1238371200,"03 30, 2009",2009,2042,"['waited', 'over', 'year', 'chance', 'see', 'film', 'when', 'opportunity', 'finally', 'arose', 'was', 'sadly', 'disappointed', 'strange', 'disjointedness', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'hope', 'follow', 'tale', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'are', 'changed', 'warped', 'favorite', 'parts', 'are', 'Hogfather', 'was', 'awardwinner', 'was', 'faithful', 'book', 'held', 'certain', 'charm', 'lovers', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'thrilled', 'Color', 'Magic', 'sadly', 'charm', 'fault', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Discworld', 'never', 'life', 'film', 'Perhaps', 'rushed', 'condensing', 'two', 'books', 'one', 'film', 'perhaps', 'as', 'simple', 'Pratchett', 'humor', 'not', 'translating', 'properly', 'new', 'medium.Each', 'characters', 'close', 'enough', 'what', 'envisioned', 'seem', 'wander', 'hopelessly', 'scenery', 'little', 'direction', 'even', 'less', 'purpose', 'Important', 'scenes', 'trolls', 'mountain', 'are', 'cut', 'down', 'almost', 'nothing', 'explination', 'When', 'Cohen', 'finally', 'dentures', 'reason', 'sparkle', 'never', 'said', 'troll', 'teeth', 'are', 'made', 'diamonds', 'luggage', 'almost', 'forgotten', 'simply', 'mobile', 'set', 'piece', 'scenes', 'Dragon', 'castle', 'are', 'pointless', 'concept', 'imaginary', 'dragons', 'coming', 'life', 'passed', 'completely', 'making', 'disappearance', 'dragon', 'rather', 'odd', 'viewer', 'scene', 'Bel', 'Sham', 'Haroth', 'completely', 'left', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'card', 'game', 'Twoflower', 'War', 'Famine', 'Pestilence', 'Death.In', 'scenes', 'greatest', 'opportunities', 'humor', 'were', 'cut', 'were', 'left', 'were', 'patched', 'together', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'Sadly', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'avid', 'Discworld', 'fanatics', 'will', 'still', 'go', 'way', 'watch', 'just', 'know', 'not', 'lot', 'here', 'cling', 'to.Easily', 'PG', 'rating', '7', 'year', 'old', 'watched', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'did', ""n't"", 'ask', 'could', 'keep', 'normally']",Terry Pratchett's The Colour of Magic: A Spellbinding Adventure

The movie actually encompasses two of the books (which themselves could have been released together as one long piece). The performances are good and I can never pass up anything Tim Curry does.The Discworld is a strange place filled with magic instead of science (they have cameras but they work differently: a tiny imp inside the camera paints the picture). We meet Rincewind, the inept wizard who is kicked out of the university for wizards and is tasked by the Patrician to accompany the Disc's first tourist, Twoflower. It's unfortunate that Rincewind can't do magic ever since he looked at an ancient tome of spells on a dare and one of the 8 Great Spells lodged itself inside his head.It's a bit campy at times and it's done on a budget so many FX are not top notch but it's a fun way to spend an evening.

Did I also forget to mention that the hapless wizard is inhabited by an immensely powerful spell which could doom the world?  The masters of the Wizarding university, led by an unscrupulous and murderously upwardly mobile wizard are looking for the spell and consequently looking for our errant tourguide.
