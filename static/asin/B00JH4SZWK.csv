There are very few movies I give 5 star ratings to, but this is one that I'm going to be watching time and time again.Bateman plays the role of Guy Trilby, a 40 year old man, who has discovered a loop-hole in the Golden Quill Spelling Bee competition that will allow him to participate (much to the dismay of EVERYONE involved).  He is accompanied by Jenny Widgeon (Kathryn Hahn), a writer for an internet newspaper.  Upon arriving to the finals, he becomes friends with a very unlikely candidate, Chaitanya Chopra (Rohan Chand).  (I'm not sure where this kid came from, but there could not have been a better choice for this role!  The chemistry between Bateman and Chand is flawless and I loved every minute of it!)

Some words sound the same and have two conflicting meanings, and understanding the small differences between them is usually the deciding factor in these competitions, but I digress.After a pretty lengthy career, Jason Bateman has finally made his directorial debut, and the end result is Bad Words.

It's made clear that Guy Trilby (Bateman) is not the best person in the world, and he even admits his faults throughout the film, so the easily offended should probably avoid this film at all costs. He's just a character in a movie, and there are people just like him in the world. However, as vile as Guy is, his personality is nowhere near the reason this film isn't a roaring success.My opening bit about words and spelling bees wasn't written for my amusement, of course, because Bad Words centers almost exclusively on linguistics. Guy Trilby is a 40-year-old middle school dropout who manages to weasel his way into The Golden Quill, the largest, and most prestigious, spelling bee in the country. There's no arguing that Guy is the epitome of the term &#34;loser,&#34; but there's no denying that his knowledge of linguistics is impressive, to say the least. How he got this talent, or why he's forcing his way into a spelling bee made for children, no one knows, but they will soon enough.However, this is easily one of the film's biggest faults: it takes too long to get to the punchline. The film runs at just under 90 minutes, and it isn't until the last ten that the audience is finally given an explanation. I normally would not have an issue with this, but I couldn't shake the feeling that the big reveal lacked the emotional impact the writers were aiming for. It helps humanize Guy in the eyes of the viewer, yes, but this is all it really accomplishes. The information could have easily been integrated an hour earlier, and it would have had the same affect.Still, a large part of me feels like this is one of those movies that emphasizes the journey more than the destination. Because of Guy's eccentric personality, as a viewer I ached to learn more about him. I wanted to know what made him tick, and why he was so broken and lost in this world. I wanted to know what drove him to enter the spelling bee, and what he could possibly hope to gain afterward. The answers to these questions were all revealed at some point during the movie, and while I can't say I was satisfied with all of them, I had fun nonetheless.This is because Bad Words is not short in the comedy department. On the contrary, it starts off at a sprint, and it doesn't slow down until the credits start rolling. This is largely accomplished because of Guy as a character and as a personality. It has been a while since we have seen a character this blunt, manipulative, and apathetic, and Jason Bateman played the role wonderfully. I've been a fan of his for a while now, and I can safely say that this has become one of my favorite performances from him. Everything feels so fluid and natural, and I know it's wrong, but I thought it was hysterical when he was antagonizing the little kids.Not all of the comedy was necessarily perfect, though, and most of the weak material came form Guy's antics with Chaitanya Chopra (Rohan Chand), a contestant in the spelling bee. There is a montage about halfway through with Guy and Chaitanya going around wreaking havoc, and this segment is probably the hardest to swallow (it was also the most unbelievable). During this time, we see Guy and Chaitanya stealing, drinking alcohol, and messing around in a grocery store. From the minimal time we spent with Chaitanya up to that point, his actions felt extremely out of character, and you can't tell me someone of his age is going to be functioning properly after taking shots.Overall Score: 7.7/10 - I was excited to see Bad Words, and to be honest I got exactly what I expected from a comedy of this caliber. It isn't perfect, but it isn't terrible. It's funny, but it's not the funniest film ever made. My point is, it's a lot of fun, and if you can drop your guard and understand that this is a fictional character who says offensive things because he's ignorant, you'll probably enjoy yourself. Although I can't stand by paying full price for the Blu-Ray or DVD, I would strongly advise picking it up on sale or viewing it as a rental at the very least.",4,7.7/10 - Bateman is ruthless,1405641600,"07 18, 2014",2014,4880,"['Words', 'are', 'fun', 'are', ""n't"", 'may', 'seem', 'impossible', 'learn', 'people', 'take', 'pride', 'ability', 'memorize', 'large', 'portion', 'ability', 'usually', 'put', 'display', 'form', 'spelling', 'bee', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'learning', 'spelling', 'word', 'learning', 'definition', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'concepts', 'usually', 'go', 'hand-in-hand', 'when', 'think', 'words', 'sound', 'same', 'have', 'two', 'conflicting', 'meanings', 'understanding', 'small', 'differences', 'usually', 'deciding', 'factor', 'competitions', 'digress.After', 'pretty', 'lengthy', 'career', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'finally', 'made', 'directorial', 'debut', 'end', 'result', 'Bad', 'Words', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'hold', 'hand', 'not', 'here', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', ""n't"", 'care', 'made', 'clear', 'Guy', 'Trilby', 'Bateman', 'not', 'best', 'person', 'world', 'even', 'faults', 'film', 'easily', 'offended', 'should', 'probably', 'avoid', 'film', 'costs', 'just', 'character', 'movie', 'are', 'people', 'just', 'world', 'However', 'as', 'vile', 'Guy', 'personality', 'nowhere', 'reason', 'film', ""n't"", 'roaring', 'success.My', 'opening', 'bit', 'words', 'spelling', 'bees', 'was', ""n't"", 'written', 'amusement', 'course', 'Bad', 'Words', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'linguistics', 'Guy', 'Trilby', '40-year-old', 'middle', 'school', 'dropout', 'who', 'weasel', 'way', 'Golden', 'Quill', 'largest', 'most', 'prestigious', 'spelling', 'bee', 'country', 'arguing', 'Guy', 'epitome', 'term', '34', 'loser', '34', 'denying', 'knowledge', 'linguistics', 'impressive', 'say', 'least', 'How', 'got', 'talent', 'why', 'forcing', 'way', 'spelling', 'bee', 'made', 'children', 'one', 'will', 'soon', 'enough.However', 'easily', 'one', 'film', 'biggest', 'faults', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'punchline', 'film', 'just', '90', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'last', 'ten', 'audience', 'finally', 'given', 'explanation', 'normally', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'issue', 'could', ""n't"", 'shake', 'feeling', 'big', 'reveal', 'lacked', 'emotional', 'impact', 'writers', 'were', 'aiming', 'humanize', 'Guy', 'eyes', 'viewer', 'yes', 'really', 'information', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'integrated', 'hour', 'earlier', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'affect.Still', 'large', 'part', 'feels', 'one', 'movies', 'journey', 'more', 'destination', 'Guy', 'eccentric', 'personality', 'viewer', 'ached', 'learn', 'more', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'made', 'tick', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'broken', 'lost', 'world', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'drove', 'enter', 'spelling', 'bee', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'hope', 'gain', 'afterward', 'answers', 'questions', 'were', 'revealed', 'point', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'satisfied', 'had', 'fun', 'nonetheless.This', 'Bad', 'Words', 'not', 'short', 'comedy', 'department', 'contrary', 'off', 'sprint', ""n't"", 'slow', 'down', 'credits', 'start', 'rolling', 'largely', 'accomplished', 'Guy', 'character', 'personality', 'been', 'while', 'have', 'seen', 'character', 'blunt', 'manipulative', 'apathetic', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'played', 'role', 'wonderfully', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'while', 'now', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'performances', 'Everything', 'feels', 'so', 'fluid', 'natural', 'know', 'wrong', 'thought', 'was', 'hysterical', 'when', 'was', 'antagonizing', 'little', 'kids.Not', 'comedy', 'was', 'necessarily', 'perfect', 'though', 'most', 'weak', 'material', 'came', 'form', 'Guy', 'antics', 'Chaitanya', 'Chopra', 'Rohan', 'Chand', 'contestant', 'spelling', 'bee', 'montage', 'halfway', 'Guy', 'Chaitanya', 'going', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'segment', 'probably', 'hardest', 'swallow', 'was', 'also', 'most', 'unbelievable', 'time', 'see', 'Guy', 'Chaitanya', 'stealing', 'drinking', 'alcohol', 'messing', 'around', 'grocery', 'store', 'minimal', 'time', 'spent', 'Chaitanya', 'up', 'point', 'actions', 'felt', 'extremely', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'someone', 'age', 'going', 'be', 'functioning', 'properly', 'taking', 'shots.Overall', 'Score', '7.7/10', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'Bad', 'Words', 'be', 'honest', 'got', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'comedy', 'caliber', ""n't"", 'perfect', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'funny', 'not', 'funniest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'point', 'lot', 'fun', 'can', 'drop', 'guard', 'understand', 'fictional', 'character', 'who', 'offensive', 'things', 'ignorant', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'enjoy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'paying', 'full', 'price', 'Blu-Ray', 'DVD', 'would', 'strongly', 'advise', 'picking', 'up', 'sale', 'viewing', 'rental', 'very', 'least']",N/A

It might also be tricky to describe just what kind of movie this is. Sure, it's comedy and Jason Bateman is totally the right person for his role. It might be a social issue story about bad childhoods and tough luck adult lives. Or it might be a story about child neglect and abuse, but not totally. So, just what is ""Bad Words?""For one thing, Bateman, actor and director, is up front about content. There are plenty of ""bad words,"" many of which are said by the ten-year-old boy actor who is Bateman's main competitor in a prestigious national spelling bee. Also perfect is the boy's comic timing--it's incredible, or perhaps the director was on cue in his direction. When the boy is encouraged to use bad words, he blurts out with ""m-f"" so forthrightly that the viewer must wonder if he has used such words before.So what do bad words have to do with anything? Bateman's character meets all the requirements to participate in the contest, including never finishing the eighth grade. Lest you think he is not bright, the viewer learns that this character is a genius, which becomes quite evident during the spelling phase. The director of the bee, out of outrage that Bateman has bested all the adults in preventing him from participating, rigs the contest so that he gets all the 40-letter words, which, of course, he can spell.Bateman uses any unethical, tacky, downright immoral tactics to disqualify various contestants. Chaitanya spends his contest time in a hotel room alone. His dad wants him to be his own man. What? Alone? A ten-year-old? Bateman takes him out for recreation and fun, his version. Expect the unexpected. And it's all funny (I say under my breath because showing a ten-year-old a prostitute's huge breasts just does not seem right...).See? Words just cannot do this movie justice. It is so uniquely funny, even though repulsively so. After Bateman digs in under the viewer's skin, he becomes Everyman in a plot to get justice, no matter how. Comic bite and poignant justice are served equally well. I really appreciated both Bateman's intent and delivery of intent. The movie, I predict, will become a classic.",4,Winning,1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,2251,"['are', 'kinds', 'words', 'there', 'use', 'describe', 'Bad', 'Words', 'finding', 'right', 'ones', 'might', 'be', 'tricky', 'might', 'also', 'be', 'tricky', 'describe', 'just', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'Sure', 'comedy', 'Jason', 'Bateman', 'totally', 'right', 'person', 'role', 'might', 'be', 'social', 'issue', 'story', 'bad', 'childhoods', 'tough', 'luck', 'adult', 'might', 'be', 'story', 'child', 'neglect', 'abuse', 'not', 'totally', 'So', 'just', 'what', 'Bad', 'Words', 'one', 'thing', 'Bateman', 'actor', 'director', 'up', 'front', 'content', 'are', 'plenty', 'bad', 'words', 'many', 'are', 'said', 'ten-year-old', 'boy', 'actor', 'who', 'Bateman', 'main', 'competitor', 'prestigious', 'national', 'spelling', 'bee', 'Also', 'perfect', 'boy', 'comic', 'timing', 'incredible', 'perhaps', 'director', 'was', 'cue', 'direction', 'When', 'boy', 'encouraged', 'use', 'bad', 'words', 'out', 'm-f', 'so', 'forthrightly', 'viewer', 'must', 'wonder', 'used', 'such', 'words', 'before.So', 'what', 'do', 'bad', 'words', 'have', 'do', 'anything', 'Bateman', 'character', 'requirements', 'participate', 'contest', 'including', 'never', 'finishing', 'eighth', 'grade', 'Lest', 'think', 'not', 'bright', 'viewer', 'character', 'genius', 'quite', 'evident', 'spelling', 'phase', 'director', 'bee', 'outrage', 'Bateman', 'bested', 'adults', 'preventing', 'participating', 'contest', 'so', '40-letter', 'words', 'course', 'can', 'spell.Bateman', 'unethical', 'tacky', 'downright', 'immoral', 'tactics', 'disqualify', 'various', 'contestants', 'Chaitanya', 'contest', 'time', 'hotel', 'room', 'alone', 'dad', 'be', 'own', 'man', 'What', 'Alone', 'ten-year-old', 'Bateman', 'out', 'recreation', 'fun', 'version', 'Expect', 'unexpected', 'funny', 'say', 'breath', 'showing', 'ten-year-old', 'prostitute', 'huge', 'breasts', 'just', 'not', 'seem', 'right', '.See', 'Words', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'movie', 'justice', 'so', 'uniquely', 'funny', 'even', 'repulsively', 'so', 'Bateman', 'viewer', 'skin', 'Everyman', 'plot', 'get', 'justice', 'matter', 'how', 'Comic', 'bite', 'poignant', 'justice', 'are', 'served', 'equally', 'well', 'really', 'appreciated', 'Bateman', 'intent', 'delivery', 'intent', 'movie', 'predict', 'will', 'become', 'classic']",N/A

Except that all the foul language, all the subversive antics hurled toward the kids competing in the bee, and all the bizarre and down right creepy sexual encounters (with the tag-along reporter) don't shock the audience as much as they repulse the audience.  We are pummeled to death with this stuff from beginning to end, so it's no surprise we are left with no connection to the character.  Nor do we have the slightest desire to understand his motivation behind his belligerent and aggressive intrusion into a nationally and annually held spelling bee for kids.

The weird thing about it is that in this movie they come across in such a way you get to a point where u begin to accept them and as hard as it is for me to accept saying this they become part in a sarcastic way for them to be there that they almost grown in you due to the plot hence the reason for the title movieJason plays at successful 40 yrs old business man that takes time off from work specifically to join the competition &#34;as a contestant&#34; of the now famous annual spelling bee after finding a Loophole within the rules of the competition that no matter how old a person is if you have never completed your education passed the 8th grade you are in fact eligible to be part of it and compete among the rest of the kids. It does strikes a bit funny when you see this grown adult man sitting between 30 to 40 kids that are there to compete as well. When the organizers of the spelling bee at about to begin the first competition and noticed him on stage and of course delaying the contest as they try to convince Jason he is not allowed to participate only to have Jason remind them &#34;word per word&#34; as to regulations of the competition which he learned each page and paragraph of them and recited to them with a warning that he would file an injuction to delay the competition and take them to court therefore delaying the whole process where they eventually give into allowing him and to be part of it. Of course as expected he starts winning them as they go from town to town and the amount of kids start reducing by the time they get to the national televised final one but still a decent amount of them still make it as well and try to give Jason's character a run for his money. Of course by this point everyone involved in the competition has heard of what he is doing from protesting parents demanding he gets thrown out by the officials but apparently not being able to. Of course this doesn't stop the director of it all whom dislikes very much in accordance with the parents promising them she will handle the matter or resign her 30 yrs position if she is not succesfully doing so by the time competition ends and she goes far enough to insert into the computers some pretty long and difficult words that no one ever heard of and for a regular person would be hard to spell correctly making sure that thru the competition these words would appear at the precise moment is Jason's turn to come to the mike and nailing the spelling correctly every word. During the competition there are some mean but funny jokes done by Jason to kids seating near his area causing the kid to walk out on the competition but there were not bad things he would do to them he would just plain with their brain while waiting their turn to diminish the kids confidence and does it successfully.Thru the movie he develops a friendly relationship with a particular kids that does a superb job as a supporting job. However, this relationship is different than one would have would a kid, and NO there is nothing sexual about it Jason is just kind of a loner and has been for most of his life when his mom died young and his father walked out on them when he was barely walking he tells you this while opening up to this kid whom has had such a deprived life by his parents by not allowing him to be &#34;a kid&#34; and the kid even though Jason treats him like crap while they are together by using bad words and giving the kid the &#34;finger sign&#34; as a goodnight gesture which the kid enjoys in the way that he gets to understand Jason and his way. There is a point to all this Jason does as well as a very good reason for doing it once he finds out something about the coordinators of the competition to which he enters it not to take away the award from any kid usually monetary which he really doesn't need but if not for other reason than revenge and he does it well.

He has an on-line sponsor reporter (Kathryn Hahn) follow him around attempting to get a story, but even she doesn't know why he is doing this.Guy is rude to just about everyone, especially his fellow contestants with whom he plays mind games.

Now in his 40's he finds a loophole and begins to compete in the Golden Quill Spelling Bee. Not only does he have to compete against kids 1/4 of his age but the parents of the kids are very upset about this. Those in charge of the bee are also against this but technically he is in the rules so they can't do anything. A reporter is following him around trying to find the reason why this is happening but he remains steadfast in his quest until he meets Chaitanya Chopra (Chand). For my money Jason Bateman is one of the funniest people around and the fact that he wrote and directed this made me want to see it that much more. I will say this wasn't what I was expecting...it was much better. The best and easiest way to describe this is a toned down (but not by much) version of Bad Santa. An adult with a grudge and no real morals befriends a kid but doesn't change who he is at all. If you get offended easily this may be one to think twice about because there are some things that make you laugh at the uncomfortable aspect of what is happening. The movie is excellently written and the cast is great. Bateman is great at playing a jerk but still having some heart. For me the best part of the movie is that there isn't the sappy moment that usually happens in movies like this. Overall, if you liked Bad Santa then watch this.
