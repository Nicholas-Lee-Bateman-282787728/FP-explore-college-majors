1160823,A1B52CX9YT7PZM,B0018RCN5E,"asiriusbee ""Dana~""","[1, 1]","Well, I must admit that I wasn't too crazy about this series. I started watching it on the FUNIMATION channel at night and got hooked! I caught the last few episodes, so when it was over, I had to get the DVD set and watch from the beginning. I ordered and received the DVDs right before Christmas and I haven't been able to stop watching!!! It's not the acting that has me hooked -- it's the band members and how they interact with each other. I've never been in a band, but I've always been a music lover of all types of music! (Guess it has something to do with me being an Army brat growing up in Germany!) The songs are amazing -- I am now a lover of the bass guitar -- been on the internet looking for all the CDs this anime references (Jimi Hendrix, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kurt Cobain, Nirvana & hell, maybe even Rage Against the Machine).This anime is not for very young kids; I would say teenagers and older and that's only because they use the work f*** and as***** alot!!!!For those of you who love music with heart and meaning, this series is for you!!! For those of you who have ever been in a band, wanted to join a band, or been a fan of those obscure, unknown bands playing in some dive, you'll love this series even more so!!!",5,Almost my favorite anime series yet!!!,1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,1243,"['Well', 'must', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'crazy', 'series', 'started', 'watching', 'FUNIMATION', 'channel', 'night', 'got', 'hooked', 'caught', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'so', 'when', 'was', 'had', 'get', 'DVD', 'set', 'watch', 'beginning', 'ordered', 'received', 'DVDs', 'right', 'Christmas', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'stop', 'watching', 'not', 'acting', 'hooked', 'band', 'members', 'how', 'interact', 'other', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'band', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'music', 'lover', 'types', 'music', 'Guess', 'something', 'do', 'being', 'Army', 'brat', 'growing', 'up', 'Germany', 'songs', 'are', 'amazing', 'am', 'now', 'lover', 'bass', 'guitar', 'been', 'internet', 'looking', 'CDs', 'anime', 'references', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'Red', 'Hot', 'Chili', 'Peppers', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'Nirvana', 'hell', 'maybe', 'even', 'Rage', 'Machine', '.This', 'anime', 'not', 'very', 'young', 'kids', 'would', 'say', 'teenagers', 'older', 'only', 'use', 'work', 'f***', 'as*****', 'alot', 'who', 'love', 'music', 'heart', 'meaning', 'series', 'who', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'band', 'wanted', 'join', 'band', 'been', 'fan', 'obscure', 'unknown', 'bands', 'playing', 'dive', ""'ll"", 'love', 'series', 'even', 'more', 'so']",N/A

1160825,ANCNEU3MD7RR,B0018RCN5E,FizzWiz,"[0, 0]","The anime slowly hits on subtle differences between Japanese and American cultures with the American dubbed version.  The voices are synched so well with the storyline and characters.  The music was put together in such ways that the actors had to practice music as if they were living in a ""Beck"" world, and in some cases, they had to try to play crappier quality of music than they would normally play.The plot line slowly develops and shows some of the hardships an underground band goes through in an exaggerated manner to reach an indie level and ultimately stardom.  The dog, Beck, shows up from time to time, and Keith does not even make an appearance until much later on in the series!The translations were particularly difficult not just because some things do not translate, but music was honed for an American audience and language was interpreted for a American audience.  Some of the Japanese translations were kept literally, and some were replaced with different, similar slang translations because the directors had to choose between if they thought literal interpretation or keeping the context of the content intact more important for the series.  Sometimes, literal translations were better to display the cultural divide between American and Japanese cultures, and sometimes similar English translations were chosen instead.  In one of the 4 last episodes, there was something that literally translated to something like ""hotter than tabasco sauce"" and instead would have been replaced by something like ""the sky is the limit.""The crew did well in choosing what should be changed and how.I'm not much of a hard rock fan, but I love the variety of Beck.  There end up being 2 vocalists for the band- one for hard rock/talk and one for melodic music.  It's a great combination to keep you moving.  Beck/Mongolian Chop Squad would probably so be one of my bands of choice if I was at a music festival.  An indie music aficionado and anime lovers of depth in content could appreciate a series such as this.  The way it ends makes it seem like there could be a second season, but I unfortunately doubt it would come to that.  It would be hard to match the merit of the first season, and I think it would be hard to garner support for such a good quality anime that may not fit in well enough to suit mainstream tastes at this time.",5,The Ultimate Rock/Alternative Band,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",2011,2346,"['anime', 'slowly', 'hits', 'subtle', 'differences', 'Japanese', 'American', 'cultures', 'American', 'dubbed', 'version', 'voices', 'are', 'synched', 'so', 'well', 'storyline', 'characters', 'music', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'such', 'ways', 'actors', 'had', 'practice', 'music', 'were', 'living', 'Beck', 'world', 'cases', 'had', 'try', 'play', 'crappier', 'quality', 'music', 'would', 'normally', 'play.The', 'plot', 'line', 'slowly', 'hardships', 'underground', 'band', 'exaggerated', 'manner', 'reach', 'indie', 'level', 'ultimately', 'stardom', 'dog', 'Beck', 'up', 'time', 'time', 'Keith', 'not', 'even', 'make', 'appearance', 'much', 'later', 'series', 'translations', 'were', 'particularly', 'difficult', 'not', 'just', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'translate', 'music', 'was', 'honed', 'American', 'audience', 'language', 'was', 'interpreted', 'American', 'audience', 'Japanese', 'translations', 'were', 'kept', 'literally', 'were', 'replaced', 'different', 'similar', 'slang', 'translations', 'directors', 'had', 'choose', 'thought', 'literal', 'interpretation', 'keeping', 'context', 'content', 'intact', 'more', 'important', 'series', 'Sometimes', 'literal', 'translations', 'were', 'better', 'display', 'cultural', 'divide', 'American', 'Japanese', 'cultures', 'sometimes', 'similar', 'English', 'translations', 'were', 'chosen', 'instead', 'one', '4', 'last', 'episodes', 'was', 'something', 'literally', 'translated', 'something', 'hotter', 'tabasco', 'sauce', 'instead', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'replaced', 'something', 'sky', 'limit', 'crew', 'did', 'well', 'choosing', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'changed', 'how.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'hard', 'rock', 'fan', 'love', 'variety', 'Beck', 'end', 'up', 'being', '2', 'vocalists', 'band-', 'one', 'hard', 'rock/talk', 'one', 'melodic', 'music', 'great', 'combination', 'keep', 'moving', 'Beck/Mongolian', 'Chop', 'Squad', 'would', 'probably', 'so', 'be', 'one', 'bands', 'choice', 'was', 'music', 'festival', 'indie', 'music', 'aficionado', 'anime', 'lovers', 'depth', 'content', 'could', 'appreciate', 'series', 'such', 'way', 'seem', 'could', 'be', 'second', 'season', 'unfortunately', 'doubt', 'would', 'come', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'match', 'merit', 'first', 'season', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'garner', 'support', 'such', 'good', 'quality', 'anime', 'may', 'not', 'fit', 'well', 'enough', 'suit', 'mainstream', 'tastes', 'time']",N/A

The Next day amazon informed me it would arrive Christmas eve as it did. I heard much dislike to the save cover and I too didn't like it much. But it was no problem Beck came with a reversible dvd cover. Let me tell you the other side of the cover look beautiful. Now lets move onto the dvd. I originally saw this series on tv and it made me want to buy it when I found it at such a low price and luckily for me I jumped on the sale and Bought it for $12.99. It is great and being uncut it is nice to see the differences like the fact the F word is said over 5 times in the first episode I would definitely recommend anyone to buy this it is a great buy. I give it 4/5 stars because of the save cover and the fact it is all put into one clear dvd box and isn't a 'box set'.

1160828,A3F9VH8916IA40,B0018RCN5E,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[27, 33]","I had mixed feelings about this show after I finished watching it last night; on one hand it isn't a perfect series and has some really obvious flaws that kept popping up over and over again. On the other hand those flaws seemed rather insignificant when compared to the overall quality of the show. Docking this show a star because of those flaws almost felt like taking a star away from Cowboy Bebop because ED was an unrealistic character. I mean, who cares?Beck is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining shows I've ever seen. Apart from Cowboy Bebop I don't think I've ever seen an anime that was as much fun as this one was. It has a lot in common with Bebop in fact; both share similar strengths (although Bebop doesn't really have a weakness and Beck does), namely great characters and soundtrack.Kyukee is a middle school boy meandering through life without a sense of purpose. He, like many his age, lacks anything to be passionate about or any real hope for the future. That all changes one day when he runs into an ugly mutt named Beck and his owner, Ryuskee, who introduces him to the world of rock and teaches him how to play guitar. From that point on Kyukee is a driven young man who spends his every waking moment honing his skills. Ryuskee meanwhile has just broken up with his old band and is on the lookout to form the perfect band. The end result is Beck, or the Mongolian Chop Squad as it's known in America.The music is far and away the best part about this show. If Beck were a real band, I'd probably be a fan, and you can bet that I'm going to buy the soundtrack for this show. From the soft melody ""Full Moon Rises"" to more hardcore rocker songs like ""Typhoon"" (which was a bit silly with its whole ""Typhoon twenty four, twenty four seven"" lines but it sounded great) almost every song is amazing; which helps disguise the limited animation it had. It even defeats Bebops jazz music, a shocker I know considering how amazing Bebops music is, but I honestly think Beck has it beat, at least if you like rock music. Otherwise I'd skip this show completely. This is a show you'll want to watch in English, and trust me the dub is as great as any show out there. The mouths don't match the words when their singing (so it's like watching a Godzilla movie almost) but that's a small price to pay for the great music you'll get.At times during the show it annoyed me that when the bands were playing they wouldn't play the whole song and would stop them mid way through. Well don't let this bother you too much because each volume has its own music video with the complete song just for your listening pleasure.Along with the music the characters are the second best part of this show, with my favorite being the lead singer, Cheeva. No matter what kind of person you are there will be someone in this show you'll be able to love. Tiara the bass player who's really quiet and introspective, the crazy and charming older friend to Kyukee (sorry, can't remember his name right now), it doesn't matter; most of the main characters are great. But there is also a problem with the characters; there are too many and lots of them don't play any special role or add anything to the overall story. Many characters that are important in the opening volumes suddenly disappear later on, leaving the viewers wondering just what happened to them. A lot of back story is put into some of these characters and a lot if time is invested into them only to have them dropped completely. Izumi is a good example. During the first volume she serves as a love interest for Kyukee and takes up a lot of time, which led me to think she would play an important role during the rest of the show. That wasn't the case however. After the second volume she only made one more brief appearance and its one of those blink and you'll miss it kind of deals. Another character that didn't make much sense was Hiro, who apparently was yet ANOTHER love interest for Kyukee, to go along with Izumi and Mahoo (Ryuskee's younger sister who's also fourteen). Her character didn't do anything during the show, didn't make the main characters grow at all, and really didn't do anything, and yet a lot of time is invested into her. Why? Why bother dropping an already well established character and introducing anther one? Some characters play really important roles yet only show up a handful of times; others play an insignificant role and yet show up almost every episode. Now what's the deal with that?Also one more oddity I found was the age of all the characters. Kyukee is only fourteen years old at the beginning of the show, while the older members of the band are sixteen, and yet there is no sign of any parents, they act as if they were much older, and are even allowed into bars. The absence of parents was a bit unusual because you'd hear Kyukee's mother all the time and yet you'd never actually see her and she'd never do anything. She never even went to hear him sing. This was probably done on purpose but it was still a bit weird. If all the characters involved were just two years older all those problems would have been solved, but as it was I couldn't help but remember that even the most mature characters in this show are three years younger then me.It might sound like I didn't like the show, but I really did and it's probably one of my favorites, but I have to point out its flaws for those thinking about buying it. It's a great show, with amazing music and some really great characters. It's very similar to Bebop in so many ways, and yet has some flaws that I could not ignore. Overall it's a great show though and I could not recommend it enough.Pros.-Great rock music.-Some really interesting characters.-The best dub since Cowboy Bebop.-Very funny at times.Cons.-Characters are too young, there are too many of them, and many great ones are dropped while the bad ones are kept on.Replay Value; EXTREMELY high.",5,"A bit messy at times, but still great. 4.5",1217808000,"08

1160829,A315DYNLQAYGQH,B0018RCN5E,Mr. V. Lee,"[0, 0]","I had an idea of what to expect when I bought this. I luckily had a cheap DVD player that I found the hack codes/keystroke to make multiregion so I could watch Region1 dvds.I read waaay back in 2007 about BECK:Mongolian Chop Squad in NEO magazine. A British anime/manga/asian culture magazine which I still collect to this day. The reviews and articles stand up to age very well, since anime gets released a few years after they first appeared in Japan. When things eventually come to the UK I think, "" wow this sounds familiar "" and I look up my old magazine collection that featured it ( I have binders of them now ).BECK, I recall works better in Japanese Dub. But there were a few episodes I watched in English dub for some comparison. The English dub had to rewrite some of the script and the dialogue is different from the subs.They did a good job, and the singing voice in the Eng dub for the English themed songs is actually better than the Japanese EngRish original.At times the anime features American characters or english speaking characters, and the Japanese dub relates the main character's loss at not being able to understand them because English is taught so badly in Japan.  The English dub had to rework things here but the audience will have to suspend some disbelief and remember the main character is Japanese and doesn't understand English.The series touches on childhood, coming of age, friendship, betrayal, love. All the things to make us remember our own teenage years and how we relate or not relate at all. I got a bit sentimental watching the series even though of course I never dated a Japanese American/ganguro Japanese girl or been to that many rock gigs, or even played in a band.The music, is really cool.

1160831,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B0018RCN5E,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[9, 10]","____ Mongolian Chop Squad was discontinued by Funimation a couple of years back. They promised it would be back but little was heard regarding it. A few months ago I emailed them and they assured me it would be available this summer, and apparently its true. Now that they've cleared up some legal issues they are re-releasing it without the BECK section of the title. How much of the series has been changed to facilitate this is still unknown, likely an episode name change and a title card change at least, but if you've been waiting to own this series this is the best way to pick it up. Old DVD sets with the Beck title run anywhere from $60-$200 on online sites such as e-bay, and despite the true name missing you still get this great series to own and enjoy at your leisure.The animation in this series is limited for cost purposes, the show is arguably slow paced and has a slow burn arc over the season and yet all these things help add to the series tone, this is one of the best slice of life anime out there, possibly the best. This show catches the essence of adolescence, what its like to have too much time on your hand and the need to fill that time with aspirations for greater things. What is nice is that the show moves from that into exploring a very realistic portrayal of the underground club/music scene and what it is like for a band just starting out. The English Dub is actually quite well done, despite the lip flaps not matching during the majority of songs. The music is great too considering it was just written for the show, you can tell they employed real talent to help them create songs that would sound genuine while echoing familiar bands from whom MCS draws their style, as most start ups do whether purposefully or not.If you haven't seen this series and it seems interesting Funimation has all the episodes up for free on Youtube, if you have seen this show you are more likely than not one of the many who love it (I can't see why the small percentage who dislike it would visit this product page). So for $20 the changes will likely be tolerable, as unfortunate as they are.My only qualm about the series itself is a personal one. The ending felt rushed, around episode 23/24 everything puts you on a high, while the manga continues on with the bands adventures in America the anime just ends at episode 26 with a slide show alluding to some of these events. It's not a big deal but it leaves one anticipating a second season, though I'm happy this was a 26 episode series as they tend to be some of the strongest out there (Cowboy Bebop comes to mind). It also seems odd that there is little conclusion to the love story established throughout the series, they had the perfect opportunity at the end of the final episode and seemed to leave it hanging only because the manga did, but the manga continued on.This is a five star series without a doubt. At least fans are being given the chance to own it again and hopefully new fans will continue to find it.",5,"Beck is Back, though in fewer words",1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,2999,"['____', 'Mongolian', 'Chop', 'Squad', 'was', 'discontinued', 'Funimation', 'couple', 'years', 'back', 'promised', 'would', 'be', 'back', 'little', 'was', 'heard', 'regarding', 'few', 'months', 'emailed', 'assured', 'would', 'be', 'available', 'summer', 'apparently', 'true', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'cleared', 'up', 'legal', 'issues', 'are', 're-releasing', 'BECK', 'section', 'title', 'How', 'much', 'series', 'been', 'changed', 'facilitate', 'still', 'unknown', 'likely', 'episode', 'name', 'change', 'title', 'card', 'change', 'least', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'own', 'series', 'best', 'way', 'pick', 'up', 'Old', 'DVD', 'Beck', 'title', 'run', 'anywhere', '60-', '200', 'online', 'sites', 'such', 'e-bay', 'true', 'name', 'missing', 'still', 'get', 'great', 'series', 'own', 'enjoy', 'leisure.The', 'animation', 'series', 'limited', 'cost', 'purposes', 'show', 'arguably', 'slow', 'paced', 'slow', 'burn', 'arc', 'season', 'yet', 'things', 'help', 'add', 'series', 'tone', 'one', 'best', 'slice', 'life', 'anime', 'there', 'possibly', 'best', 'show', 'essence', 'adolescence', 'what', 'like', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hand', 'need', 'fill', 'time', 'aspirations', 'greater', 'things', 'What', 'nice', 'show', 'exploring', 'very', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'underground', 'club/music', 'scene', 'what', 'band', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'English', 'Dub', 'actually', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'lip', 'not', 'matching', 'majority', 'songs', 'music', 'great', 'too', 'considering', 'was', 'just', 'written', 'show', 'can', 'tell', 'employed', 'real', 'talent', 'help', 'create', 'songs', 'would', 'sound', 'genuine', 'echoing', 'familiar', 'bands', 'whom', 'MCS', 'style', 'most', 'start', 'ups', 'do', 'purposefully', 'not.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'interesting', 'Funimation', 'episodes', 'free', 'Youtube', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'not', 'one', 'many', 'who', 'love', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'small', 'percentage', 'who', 'would', 'visit', 'product', 'page', 'So', '20', 'changes', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'tolerable', 'as', 'unfortunate', 'are.My', 'only', 'qualm', 'series', 'personal', 'one', 'ending', 'felt', 'rushed', '23/24', 'everything', 'puts', 'high', 'manga', 'bands', 'America', 'anime', 'just', 'episode', '26', 'slide', 'show', 'alluding', 'events', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'one', 'anticipating', 'second', 'season', ""'m"", 'happy', 'was', '26', 'episode', 'series', 'tend', 'be', 'strongest', 'there', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'mind', 'also', 'odd', 'little', 'conclusion', 'love', 'story', 'established', 'series', 'had', 'perfect', 'opportunity', 'end', 'final', 'episode', 'seemed', 'leave', 'hanging', 'only', 'manga', 'did', 'manga', 'continued', 'on.This', 'five', 'star', 'series', 'doubt', 'least', 'fans', 'are', 'being', 'given', 'chance', 'own', 'again', 'hopefully', 'new', 'fans', 'will', 'continue', 'find']",N/A

1160833,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B0018RCN5E,trashcanman,"[19, 20]","""Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad"" is easily one of the finest animated series I've ever watched.  In  many ways, it may actually be the best.  I don't believe I've ever seen a work of fiction that captures the energy, emotion, and passion of rock music in a more authentic way.  Every person who had a hand in creating this show and bringing it to America should be extremely proud of themselves.  If you've ever truly loved music, then don't hesitate to check this show out.Koyuki is a puny, shy typical geek with no passion in his life at all until the day he meets a jacked-up dog named Beck.  The dog's owner happens to be a shining star of the local rock scene and introduces him to a band named Dying Breed.  It changes his life.  The pop idol fanatic is instantly struck and begins learning to play guitar.  It will be one hell of a journey.  Beck's owner Ryusuke's (Ray for short)  band has just fallen apart and the wannabe pro is on the lookout for the members to build ""the ultimate band"".  Koyuki tags along and immerses himself in the local music scene, meeting Ray's gorgeous, charming, jet-setting sister Maho, who is a singer.  The two hit it off, and the relationship will have it's ups, down, and hot and cold spots throughout the series.  Eventually, the band BECK comes to be with a ragtag lineup that is impossible to resist.  Ryusuke: the hot-as-lava lead guitar phenom.  Taira: the ice cold pro on the bass.  Chiba: local maniac with a rap-influenced vocal delivery on the mic whipping crowds into a frenzy.  Saku: self-taught drummer and Koyuki's backbone.  Koyuki: green as grass beginner whose vulnerable rhythm guitar and emotional singing will make BECK a sensation....if they can stay together.  The cast of characters in the is series is amazing.  There's even a rockin' cockatoo ( I call him a rockatoo) who shrieks ""A$ZHOOOOOLE!!!!"" constantly.  Gotta love that.  Each character is brought to life in the art, animation, and performances as lovingly as each beautiful musical instrument featured in the show.  And once you see the close-ups of Ray's bullet-ridden Les Paul (which has a wild subplot all its own), you will see the artists are very much in love with guitars.  I can relate.If there is a single weak spot in ""Beck"", it's the anime cliche of a romance that never goes anywhere.  I don't know how these things go in Japan, but where I come from, you don't only kiss a girl twice in three years and pretend nothing's there when there's almost instant electricity between you and nothing to stop you.  There are other love interests, but they never go anywhere meaningful either.  I was really excited by the prospect of a more mature look at romance from a show that is extremely mature in every other sense, but it didn't pan out that way.  But  I can say that I was pretty riveted by the whole thing which is to say that even the one negative turns into a positive when the storytelling is as effective as this show's and the characters are so fantastic.Honestly, I was amazed at how realistically the music scene in ""Beck"" is portrayed.  Anybody who has been in a band or had friends in bands and sat in on practices and gone to the local gigs should be floored by how the whole vibe is captured so perfectly.  This show was very obviously created not only by music fans, but by serious musicians.  It brought back a ton of great memories for me and made me wish more then I have in years and years that I had had the talent and commitment to start a band.  Some of the best music you've ever heard is likely being played in front of a dozen or so drunks a few blocks from your house in a garage or bar and the band will probably break up with only a select few ever knowing how great they were together.  That's the scene that this show portrays and the cast of characters could have come from any city in the world.  It's ridiculously relatable.After a staggering series of events ""Beck"" eventually climaxes at Japan's biggest music festival in one of the greatest performances I've ever seen from a band.  And considering this band is animated and I couldn't begin to count how many non-animated performances I've watched that is saying a hell of a lot.  The energy and passion is just amazing and I couldn't even stay in my seat; I really felt like I was watching a legendary performance from an amazing rock band.  I've never, ever gotten that from a television show, live action or not.  BECK hit it out of the park.  I was sad to see it end and I can't wait to watch it all again and again.The English dub on the American DVD's is better then the Japanese track.  I said it.  It's true.  While the subtitles are a more literal translation and much of the dialogue is actually in English which leads to some issues with characters who speak different languages speaking the same language on the dub, the American cast, writers, and producers did a phenomenal job at punching up the dialogue to sound very natural and adding a lot of extra swear words to boot.  Some may take offense, but the fact is that's how these sorts of people talk so it only adds to the realism in the end.  There are some commentaries with the cast that are completely off-the-wall insane as well.  Almost as funny as the show is.  Each disc also has a BECK music video, all of which are sweet as hell.""Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad"" is everything an anime should be.  It's anything any show can strive for.  It strikes every chord perfectly, lays down a beat that'll make you want to follow it anywhere, and  screams ""WE WILL, WE WILL ROCK YOU!"" At the top of it's lungs.  It ain't lying, either.  It's jam-packed with references to legendary bands and even has some cameos.  The band shares a dream at one point featuring the likes of John Lennon, Sid Vicious, and Freddy Mercury among others.  If you love rock music and are open in any way to animated entertainment then there is no excuse to pass this by.And yeah, the music ROCKS.
