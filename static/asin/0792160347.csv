130544,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,0792160347,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[3, 3]","This movie has grown on me over the years. The first time I saw it I was a teenager and at that time I really did not understand the movie. Now as an adult I can revele in the greatness of Paul Schrader's character, Julian Kaye. Simply put he is the kind of guy I've always admired. Confident, suave, intelligent and well-dressed. The man of the 1980s!Some critics like Leonard Maltin have said that the movie is a bit too slow. Yet the slowness of pace allows us to get accustomed to the character and his lifestyle. Julian is a man who seems to have it all. Clothes, women a car a nice apartment. Yet despite all of the success he appears to have he is an extremely lonely man. Michelle Stratton, wife of a prominent politician, enters his life at the right time and they begin a torrid affair. Things get dicey for Julian when he is framed for murder and the story takes off from there.I highly reccomend this movie and its similarity to later movies such as Light Sleeper (1992) and The Walker (2007) will be evident to any film buff. While I've seen Light Sleeper, I have yet to see The Walker; but I've heard it too is quite good.American Gigolo, while somewhat dated today (See Julian's Tricks Get In Contact With Him Using 1970's Technology) still holds its own when it comes to dealing with the basic human emotions of love, lust, greed and envy and hatred. Bill Duke's role as Leon was fantastic. his ruthless portrayal of a gay pimp has yet to be matched by any other actor in any similar-themed film. I won't spoil the story for you, but I will say that this is a thoroughly enjoyable Four-Star film.A.

130546,A2P3A9AT0BRMGL,0792160347,"Anthony Lombardo ""Compass56""","[3, 3]","I really like everything about this movie--Well, almost everything.  The writing and directing are top notch, as is the acting.  The story and basic concept are still fresh over 30 years later.  This one has it all--except an ending.The story of Julian, a top notch male LA prostitute (played beautifully by Richard Gere) is a complex story with many different sides and angles.  For almost two hours, the director builds Julian's story scene by scene.  Julian's story is built not so much with plot--this movie doesn't have much of that.  His story is based on how other's feel about and react to Julian.  Most of the film's &#34;plot&#34; occurs off camera, but that technique adds to Julian's isolated, lonely existence.  Of course, the other characters in the film (rich desperate women, heartless pimps, etc.) are just as lonely and isolated.  Julian is simply a carnival funhouse reflection of the rest of them and maybe of society in general.American Gigolo deserves a better ending.  Of course, that's always going to be a problem for movies like this one.  Interesting, complex movies are always saddled with the problem of quickly wrapping up that which is seemingly unwrappable.  Some films deal with this problem better than others, but American Gigolo chooses not to deal with it at all.  The film simply stops.  One minutes we are up to our neck's in Julian's complex and rapidly deteriorating life, and the next minute the whole thing is over leaving most of my questions unanswered.  Such a fine fine deserves a much better ending.",4,"Interesting, Original, Complex, and Then What?",1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,1547,"['really', 'everything', 'movie', 'Well', 'almost', 'everything', 'writing', 'directing', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'acting', 'story', 'basic', 'concept', 'are', 'still', 'fresh', '30', 'years', 'later', 'one', 'ending.The', 'story', 'Julian', 'top', 'notch', 'male', 'LA', 'prostitute', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'complex', 'story', 'many', 'different', 'sides', 'angles', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'director', 'Julian', 'story', 'scene', 'scene', 'Julian', 'story', 'built', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'story', 'based', 'how', 'other', 'feel', 'react', 'Julian', 'Most', 'film', '34', 'plot', '34', 'off', 'camera', 'technique', 'Julian', 'isolated', 'lonely', 'existence', 'course', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'rich', 'desperate', 'women', 'heartless', 'pimps', 'etc', 'are', 'just', 'lonely', 'isolated', 'Julian', 'simply', 'carnival', 'funhouse', 'reflection', 'rest', 'maybe', 'society', 'general.American', 'Gigolo', 'better', 'ending', 'course', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'problem', 'movies', 'one', 'Interesting', 'complex', 'movies', 'are', 'always', 'saddled', 'problem', 'quickly', 'wrapping', 'up', 'seemingly', 'unwrappable', 'films', 'deal', 'problem', 'better', 'others', 'American', 'Gigolo', 'not', 'deal', 'film', 'simply', 'One', 'minutes', 'are', 'up', 'neck', 'Julian', 'complex', 'rapidly', 'deteriorating', 'life', 'next', 'minute', 'whole', 'thing', 'leaving', 'most', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'fine', 'fine', 'much', 'better', 'ending']",American Gigolo
130547,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0792160347,Austin Somlo,"[3, 4]","Viewed: 10/03, 10/05, 5/08Rate: 105/08: American Gigolo is a first-class production all the way through. Nearly every scene is directed with utmost skill, and there is a professional touch of mastery. Richard Gere is perfect to play as the gigolo: somebody who is suave, high-class, and extremely good looking. Lauren Hutton looks like she belongs in upper echelon when it comes to looks, and she exudes the attitude of wealthy well-do elite. The story is very nicely written while the mystery pushes American Gigolo into film noir territory. Meanwhile, American Gigolo is the kind of a film that doesn't get much respect from critics, but it gets a lot from me since I've seen the film plenty of times and it's always a different experience each time. There is only one scene I feel that's out of place which occurs when Michele tells Julian Kay that she was planning on a trip to Rome for a couple of months. In a perspective, it felt like an obligatory scene: just to insert it in and get out of it. My feeling is that the scene should have been reworked and done better. Then again, the rest of American Gigolo is excellent. Bill Duke gets an early role playing as Leon the black pimp (or shall I say, the ""organizer""). Hector Elizondo, whom I don't like very much, gets a little screen time and is wisely put out of the way of the story. What I like about American Gigolo is the exploration of the underground out in the open with discreetness and sincerity. It is not sleazy as it suggests, and it's not too off-the-wall; but rather nice, modest, and with sprinklings of the rich and the beautiful. I love the clothes that Julian Kay wears; when I see them on and when I see everything else, high expectations for American Gigolo are expected and held. The cinematography is remarkable especially with the lighting work. A very good example occurs when Julian Kay enters in his apartment in search of the jewels. There are shadowy lines coming from the blinds being reflected onto the room while the camera is position a bit away starting from the corner. All in all, American Gigolo is a rare film that works very well given the topic and the genre and may possibly be the best picture of its league. American Gigolo gets an increase in its rating from `9' to `10'.",5,An Indelible Masterpiece.

130550,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0792160347,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[3, 3]","""American Gigolo"", like Julian Kaye, the titular gigolo played by Richard Gere, has a shimmering surface, but underneath that thin veneer lies nothing but shallow narcissism. Released in 1980, it really captured the zeitgeist of that era; you could call it the quintessential film of the 80's.Julian Kaye is most passionate when he is perfecting that surface. When he is exercising, hanging upside down from weird high tech boots while simultaneously learning to speak Swedish from instructional tapes, he is a dedicated and disciplined soldier. While sorting through his wardrobe, picking the perfect combination of tie, shirt, and pants to perfect his ensemble, he is truly alive.The rest of the time he is whining about being misunderstood, but it was impossible to understand what he was saying, half the time. He would either be mumbling, whispering -- or SHOUTING! I can only speculate on what some of the dialogue was, but Julian Kaye was always complaining, always kvetching, and always trying to negotiate a better deal. Even when he meets Michelle Stratton (Lauren Hutton), a Senator's wife and his ostensible love interest, he protests that he is not that kind of girl. She puts it bluntly:--------------Michelle Stratton: How much?======================She has already figured out what kind of girl Julie is; now they are just haggling over the price.At least she appreciates him. No one else seems to. When he finally uncovers who has been trying to frame him for a murder, he asks them, 'why me?'""Because you were framable. You've stepped on too many toes. Nobody ever cared about you. I never even liked you much myself.""It is hard for the audience to care about him, too. That makes it hard to connect with the film apart from the dazzling surface.Though set in Southern California, there's a European look to the film's mise en sc&egrave;ne, due to superb production design by (unaccredited) Ferdinando Scarfiotti. The celebrated designer is best known for his work with director Bernardo Bertolucci. Scarfiotti lacked a guild card, and was not credited for his work, but in a film that stresses style over substance, he can't be credited enough. It is the look of the film, more than the content that stays with you.When Julian gets behind the wheel of his very expensive and stylish automobile with ""Call Me"" by Blondie blasting on the soundtrack, you get a taste of what it feels like. Giorgio Moroder, best known for his work with disco diva Donna Summers, wrote the music and had Deborah Harry write the lyrics. Before Harry came up with the 'Call Me' hook the track was called ""The Man Machine."" She really nailed the concept and the whole song was finished quickly, and then rerecorded with her band, Blondie. Her voice is a perfect fit. The ""Call Me"" musical motif continues throughout the film, and some of the soundtrack was even composed by the director Paul Schrader and Moroder.For all the influence this film had, the murder mystery at its core is very weak. Director and writer Paul Schrader lacks the knack for this sort of genre, it seems, though his script for ""Taxi Driver,"" directed by Martin Scorsese, certainly generated plenty of suspense. Schrader is no Hitchcock, that's for sure. Still, there was a certain je ne sais quois about the film that captures an era, the dawning of a new and decadent decade that was the 80's.Filmography of Writer and Director Paul SchraderAuto Focus(2002)Light Sleeper(1992)Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters - Criterion Collection(1985)Cat People(1982)Hardcore(1979)Selected Roles of Richard GereI'm Not There.

130551,A38BU9SLS82TGT,0792160347,Celeste M. Harmer,"[2, 3]","As would FLASHDANCE, AMERICAN GIGOLO helped to set the tone for the nascent 80's, though not to the extent that the former movie ultimately would.Nevertheless, as we watch, we see that emerging decade called the 80's unfold.  Clearly disco was on the way out and new wave was on the way in, as evidenced by the soundtrack and fashions of this film.  Also, you will see portents of the Miami Vice look that would become all the rage five years later.AG probably represented the last bastion of promiscuity and homosexual activity that flourished free of the threat of AIDS. The disease, if it did exist in that day in age, was probably so obscure that it wasn't even discussed even among those in the medical community.AG is the story of Julian Kaye, played by a painfully young-looking Richard Gere, a high-priced male prostitute who services the older, wealthier women of Beverly Hills.  Handsome, well-paid, sophisticated, and intelligent -- he is conversant in several languages -- he seems to live an enviable life of privilege and ease.He remains emotionally unattached to the women he comes in contact with until he catches the eye of a cool blonde named Michelle, played by Lauren Hutton.  She appears to be his equal in every way, but there is a cloud of mystery that surrounds her that Julian can't quite fathom.  They part, and he doesn't expect to see her again until she unexpectedly shows up at his apartment.  They spend the night together and come to the conclusion that they are in love.Julian discovers Michelle is the wife of a prominent Senator shortly after he's asked to fill in for a fellow prostitute's gig. The assignment is to pleasure the wife of a million-dollar businessman.  To Julian's horror, he reads of this woman's murder a few days later in the paper.  His pampered existence is tainted by this tragedy.  As his and Michelle's clandestine love flourishes, he realizes that he's being framed for a murder he didn't commit.  Who is doing this to him and why are reasons he can't figure out.  In vain he tries to obtain an alibi from friends and acquaintances, only to have them withhold help.  Then one is promised to him by Leon, a fellow prosititute, but he has his own reasons for vacillating which come to light later in the film.  Michelle wants desperately to help him, but she has everything to lose and absolutely nothing to gain by providing an alibi.The plot takes a few twists and turns as the film comes to its surprising conclusion, but one thing that's never made clear, or perhaps I wasn't paying attention, is where exactly Julian was on the night of the murder.  It's obvious that he's innocent, but where was he?

130552,A3N94LNED0IF0R,0792160347,Charles S. Tashiro,"[65, 68]","American Gigolo is probably writer-director Paul Schrader's most memorable film. Richard Gere is perhaps too well cast as a strutting, smug hustler brought low by his egotism and blindness to the reality of his life. The  love story &quot;redemption&quot; centering around Lauren Hutton is pure  front-office placation. The real subject of the film is exactly the sexy  surfaces the story somewhat hypocritically pretends (but not too strongly)  to condemn.In fact, the film's most memorable sequences are both  dedicated to hard-edged commodity glitter and have nothing to do with the  love story. In the opening credits, Gere shops on Rodeo Drive then drives  down Pacific Coast Highway. Deborah Harry loudly sings out to &quot;Call  Me&quot; in the background, Gere smirks in the sunny breezes behind the  wheel of his 450SL, while the camera lovingly caresses the bumpers and hub  caps. In the famous dressing scene, Gere throws one exquisite jacket, shirt  and tie after another on to his bed as he ponders the most effective  combination. Both scenes are wonderful evocations of svelte narcissism,  cheeky self-satisfaction made into an art.To achieve these surfaces,  Schrader owes a deep debt to cinematographer John Bailey, fashion designer  Giorgio Armani and especially &quot;visual consultant&quot; (production  designer) Ferdinando Scarfiotti, who is probably chiefly responsible for  the film's famous &quot;European&quot; look. It also doesn't hurt that the  story is almost exclusively limited to the sleeker parts of LA and Southern  California-Beverly Hills, Westwood, Malibu, a side trip to Palm Springs,  with a touch of Hollywood grunge thrown in for some kicks and kink. It all  adds up to a creamy, pastel-tinged vision of LA as a show-biz Riviera,  where class and style don't come from centuries of breeding, but can be  purchased for the price of a designer shirt.It is not too much of an  exaggeration to suggest that the unsympathetic, vacant characters and  ludicrous plotting are there to wear the clothes. Intentionally or  otherwise, that hits at a truth about LA that makes the film stay in the  memory (particularly since life in the city has changed little since it was  made). It's not just the combination of the sleazy and the silky, the  cooled-out camerawork gazing alternately at rot and luxury, but the film's  realization that in LA, &quot;How much?&quot; is not just the beginning of  a financial transaction, but the only question of value people understand.",4,The Power of Surfaces,960163200,"06 5, 2000",2000,2503,"['American', 'Gigolo', 'probably', 'writer-director', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'most', 'memorable', 'film', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'perhaps', 'too', 'well', 'cast', 'strutting', 'smug', 'hustler', 'brought', 'low', 'egotism', 'blindness', 'reality', 'life', 'love', 'story', 'quot', 'redemption', 'quot', 'centering', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'pure', 'front-office', 'placation', 'real', 'subject', 'film', 'exactly', 'sexy', 'story', 'somewhat', 'hypocritically', 'not', 'too', 'strongly', 'condemn.In', 'fact', 'film', 'most', 'memorable', 'sequences', 'are', 'dedicated', 'hard-edged', 'commodity', 'glitter', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'love', 'story', 'opening', 'credits', 'Gere', 'Rodeo', 'Drive', 'then', 'down', 'Pacific', 'Coast', 'Highway', 'Deborah', 'Harry', 'loudly', 'out', 'quot', 'Call', 'Me', 'quot', 'background', 'Gere', 'sunny', 'wheel', '450SL', 'camera', 'lovingly', 'bumpers', 'hub', 'caps', 'famous', 'dressing', 'scene', 'Gere', 'one', 'exquisite', 'jacket', 'shirt', 'tie', 'bed', 'most', 'effective', 'combination', 'scenes', 'are', 'wonderful', 'evocations', 'svelte', 'narcissism', 'cheeky', 'self-satisfaction', 'made', 'art.To', 'achieve', 'surfaces', 'Schrader', 'deep', 'debt', 'cinematographer', 'John', 'Bailey', 'fashion', 'designer', 'Giorgio', 'Armani', 'especially', 'quot', 'visual', 'consultant', 'quot', 'production', 'designer', 'Ferdinando', 'Scarfiotti', 'who', 'probably', 'chiefly', 'responsible', 'film', 'famous', 'quot', 'European', 'quot', 'look', 'also', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'story', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'limited', 'sleeker', 'parts', 'LA', 'Southern', 'California-Beverly', 'Hills', 'Westwood', 'Malibu', 'side', 'trip', 'Palm', 'Springs', 'touch', 'Hollywood', 'grunge', 'thrown', 'kicks', 'kink', 'up', 'creamy', 'pastel-tinged', 'vision', 'LA', 'show-biz', 'Riviera', 'where', 'class', 'style', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'centuries', 'breeding', 'can', 'be', 'purchased', 'price', 'designer', 'shirt.It', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'exaggeration', 'suggest', 'unsympathetic', 'vacant', 'characters', 'ludicrous', 'plotting', 'are', 'there', 'wear', 'clothes', 'Intentionally', 'otherwise', 'hits', 'truth', 'LA', 'film', 'stay', 'memory', 'particularly', 'life', 'city', 'changed', 'little', 'was', 'made', 'not', 'just', 'combination', 'sleazy', 'silky', 'cooled-out', 'camerawork', 'gazing', 'alternately', 'rot', 'luxury', 'film', 'realization', 'LA', 'quot', 'How', 'much', 'quot', 'not', 'just', 'beginning', 'financial', 'transaction', 'only', 'question', 'value', 'people', 'understand']",American Gigolo

The other one was ""Officer and a Gentleman"", which cemented his status as a bankable star.  This is also an early film for mega producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, ConAir, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor).  In this film, Gere plays Julian Kaye, a gigolo who services the sexual needs of wealthy older woman.  One of his tricks gets murdered and suddenly all the evidence points to him.  Of course, his alibi refuses to admit he was with her because it would be scandalous.  The last half of the film is devoted to Julian trying to discover who is trying to frame him.  Concurrent with this plot is the story of his love affair with Michelle Stratton (Lauren Hutton) the wife of a wealthy Senator.The story isn't bad, but the dialogue is mindless and trashy, typified by Michelle's repeatedly begging for sex from Julian in the most profane and explicit terms.  There aren't any surprises that aren't completely predictable, and the mystery of who is framing Julian is painfully obvious.  The film features Blondie's hit ""Call Me"", but after hearing a couple of dozen Georgio Moroder variations on this theme on his synthesizer, it gets tiresome.Gere's performance shows promise here and his generous nude scenes make this film a favorite among his female fans.  Gere exudes a smart and sophisticated machismo in this film that would be his trademark for years to come.  For Lauren Hutton, who was more famous as a Supermodel than an actor, this role is probably her most notable.  She does an adequate job of playing the aristocratic wife with an untamed libido, but is in no danger of winning any acting awards.This is an interesting film to watch from a historical perspective if you are a Gere fan, but it is by no means a classic.

Shot in rich tones, particularly blues and greys, the director, Paul Schrader, wants us to know that we are not going to be afforded the opportunity to get to know the characters too well. One might be able to argue that American Gigolo was one of the films that literally catapulted the movie going public into the 1980's mindset of materialism.Richard Gere in one of his earliest films, protrays straight male call boy, Julian, who is tops in his game. Julian is gorgeous and knows many gorgeous women. He sleeps with those who will pay him. He doesn't bother with those who won't. Julian's lifestyle is one of everything ""is a means to an end"". He is interested in beautiful clothing and looking good, but because it helps him get something that he wants. He enjoys artwork and stylish digs, but not because he loves them, but because they are status symbols for his success. Julian enjoys being a gigolo because he is the best there is. He wouldn't (and doesn't) enjoy it when it isn't on his terms. For someone like me who feels he is too in tune with his emotions, Gere's Julian is cool, calculating and enviable. He goes about life without a care for anyone but himself.When Julian meets Lauren Hutton, he is actually smitten with her. This is evidenced by the meeting taking place in a bar with deep reds and comfortable upholstered booths instead of the abounding greys, blues, and steel evidenced elsewhere in the film.When Julian finally becomes intimate with Hutton and allows his emotional wall down for a moment, Schrader pulls us in close, but just afterward he lets us see that Julian can't maintain such intimacy and the camera pulls back for a long shot of him as he gets out of the bed leaving Lauren Hutton alone in the bed.The story is secondary to the style of the film. It is a thriller, but not an exciting one. The music of Georgio Moroder and Blondie complement the film and give it even more atmosphere. It needs it because the films two false endings drag this picture out longer than needed in trying to show us how emotional involvement can change someone. The message should be left that a lack of emotion can be dangerous.I rewatch this film every so often. It's a guilty pleasure watching the opening of the film with Julian driving down the PCH in his 450SL. Or when he's laying out different Armani outfits determining which to put on.

Fogliani-Ahmed""","[5, 5]","In my ongoing quandary to watch movies that define an era's unique style, I came across ""American Gigolo"" as a most suggestive one.  There are many things that stood out for me while watching this movie.  First and foremost, the fact that Richard Gere cast in the lead role appears to have been an absolutely perfect choice.  Not just because he is considered one of the sexiest men in Hollywood - an assumption I do not concur with - but because his inner egotistical sense shines through in this movie without quandaries.  Gere personifies to the ""T"" the typical selfish American Adonis who has achieved too much, too soon and in a far too easy way.  As such, he gets entangled in a web of deceit and murder, with everyone that he reaches out to turning their backs on him when he finds himself in desperate need of help.He finds a kindred spirit in his leading lady, the epitome of American classic and easygoing style, Lauren Hutton.  Hutton plays the role of a politician's wife, too lonely and unhappy in her marriage, and in dire need of distraction and affection.  She meets Gere by chance in a hotel restaurant, when he assumes her to be French while he overhears her talking to the waiter in that language.  Ever ready for business, he approaches her with his debonair style but wants to withdraw as soon as he learns, (a) that she is married, and (b) that she is a local.  But Hutton goes after him, dons the classical trench coat and heads to his apartment overnight.  From then on, their sizzling encounters provide for some of the movie's plot.  The rest has to do with the murder of one of Gere's customers, and his implication in it.Something that stroke me as very daring was the amount of nudity included in a movie that was filmed in 1980.  The shot of Richard Gere in full nude, with a far-sighted shot of his front genitals must have seemed quite a perversion for the time; as well as the close-up of Hutton's breasts being caressed by her lover.  Still, the nudity is tastefully done and never deviates into cheap porn.This movie also put Armani on the map of general fashion, and one can seriously take a very good and quick lesson in stylish menswear by watching the scene where Gere puts together his suits for the week.  All of his outfits are pieced together with great care, and the fact that Gere's shape is probably his best ever adds much to the movie's appeal.  After all, who wants to watch anything other than gorgeous bodies in a movie that hits all the landmarks of Los Angeles, from the Beverly Hills Hotel to its beautiful beaches?",4,A sexy thriller,1302307200,"04 9, 2011",2011,2569,"['ongoing', 'quandary', 'watch', 'movies', 'define', 'era', 'unique', 'style', 'came', 'American', 'Gigolo', 'most', 'suggestive', 'one', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'stood', 'out', 'watching', 'movie', 'First', 'foremost', 'fact', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'cast', 'lead', 'role', 'have', 'been', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'choice', 'Not', 'just', 'considered', 'one', 'sexiest', 'men', 'Hollywood', 'assumption', 'do', 'not', 'concur', 'inner', 'egotistical', 'sense', 'shines', 'movie', 'quandaries', 'Gere', 'T', 'typical', 'selfish', 'American', 'Adonis', 'who', 'achieved', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'way', 'such', 'entangled', 'web', 'deceit', 'murder', 'everyone', 'out', 'turning', 'backs', 'when', 'desperate', 'need', 'help.He', 'kindred', 'spirit', 'leading', 'lady', 'epitome', 'American', 'classic', 'easygoing', 'style', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'Hutton', 'role', 'politician', 'wife', 'too', 'lonely', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'dire', 'need', 'distraction', 'affection', 'Gere', 'chance', 'hotel', 'restaurant', 'when', 'be', 'French', 'talking', 'waiter', 'language', 'Ever', 'ready', 'business', 'debonair', 'style', 'withdraw', 'as', 'soon', 'married', 'b', 'local', 'Hutton', 'classical', 'trench', 'coat', 'heads', 'apartment', 'overnight', 'then', 'sizzling', 'encounters', 'provide', 'movie', 'plot', 'rest', 'do', 'murder', 'one', 'Gere', 'customers', 'implication', 'it.Something', 'stroke', 'very', 'daring', 'was', 'amount', 'nudity', 'included', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', '1980', 'shot', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'full', 'nude', 'far-sighted', 'shot', 'front', 'genitals', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'quite', 'perversion', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'close-up', 'Hutton', 'breasts', 'being', 'caressed', 'lover', 'Still', 'nudity', 'tastefully', 'done', 'never', 'cheap', 'porn.This', 'movie', 'also', 'put', 'Armani', 'map', 'general', 'fashion', 'one', 'can', 'seriously', 'take', 'very', 'good', 'quick', 'lesson', 'stylish', 'menswear', 'watching', 'scene', 'where', 'Gere', 'together', 'suits', 'week', 'outfits', 'are', 'pieced', 'together', 'great', 'care', 'fact', 'Gere', 'shape', 'probably', 'best', 'ever', 'much', 'movie', 'appeal', 'who', 'watch', 'anything', 'other', 'gorgeous', 'bodies', 'movie', 'landmarks', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Hotel', 'beautiful', 'beaches']",American Gigolo
130576,A5GG4C0R5JZU0,0792160347,Kyle A. Herschend,"[1, 1]","I've always thought Richard Gere to be a reliable actor. He gets the job done. So it is nice to see a very young Gere -- early in his career -- show the prowess and magnetism we witness in his films today. What is especially intriguing about Gere in Gigolo is that it foreshadows his role in Pretty Woman, which was made exactly 10 years later. Obviously, there is some role reversal, and the plot is quite different in terms of suspense vs. romance. But I cannot help comparing the movies to one another.For one thing, another recognizable actor, Victor Elizondo, is in both flicks. Even though his parts are remarkably different, I get the same sleazy uncle vibe from him in each. Certainly, his characters are not such you either like or hate -- he's not a convincing enough performer for that type of distinction.Both movies are love stories. Gigolo tries very hard the first hour and forty-five minutes resisting that categorization. So, as a romance, it fails. But what it lacks in romance it makes up in suspense. Although, I cannot say the murder mystery is as interesting as how Gere's beleaguered character handles himself throughout the story.About Paul Schrader's direction. Not sure if I consider Gigolo to be ""stylized,"" as I see it described by some. Nothing about the movie is eye-popping or outside the normal mode of expression for the 1980s. Of course, one could argue that it ""set the tone"" for the decade. I don't have sufficient knowledge of filmmaking in the late 70s and early 80s to verify that.Moreover, I question Schrader's decision to speed up the conclusion of Gigolo. There are a lot of fast-forward transitions (fade-out, fade-in sequences) at the end of the movie that clash with the steady pace of all but the final 15-20 minutes. I also question Schrader's frequent insertion of that catchy, but eventually annoying, ""Call Me"" song by Blondie. He even uses purely instrumental renditions. I was about to blow my brains out.All that said, American Gigolo pleases well enough.",3,Gere is the best part of this so-so flick,1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,2009,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'be', 'reliable', 'actor', 'job', 'done', 'nice', 'see', 'very', 'young', 'Gere', 'early', 'career', 'show', 'prowess', 'magnetism', 'witness', 'films', 'today', 'What', 'especially', 'intriguing', 'Gere', 'Gigolo', 'role', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'was', 'made', 'exactly', '10', 'years', 'later', 'Obviously', 'role', 'reversal', 'plot', 'quite', 'different', 'terms', 'suspense', 'vs.', 'romance', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'comparing', 'movies', 'one', 'another.For', 'one', 'thing', 'recognizable', 'actor', 'Victor', 'Elizondo', 'flicks', 'Even', 'parts', 'are', 'remarkably', 'different', 'get', 'same', 'sleazy', 'uncle', 'vibe', 'Certainly', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'such', 'either', 'hate', 'not', 'convincing', 'enough', 'performer', 'type', 'distinction.Both', 'movies', 'are', 'love', 'stories', 'Gigolo', 'very', 'hard', 'first', 'hour', 'forty-five', 'minutes', 'resisting', 'categorization', 'So', 'romance', 'what', 'romance', 'up', 'suspense', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'murder', 'mystery', 'as', 'interesting', 'how', 'Gere', 'beleaguered', 'character', 'story.About', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'direction', 'Not', 'sure', 'consider', 'Gigolo', 'be', 'stylized', 'see', 'described', 'Nothing', 'movie', 'eye-popping', 'normal', 'mode', 'expression', '1980s', 'course', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'set', 'tone', 'decade', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'sufficient', 'knowledge', 'filmmaking', 'late', '70s', 'early', '80s', 'verify', 'that.Moreover', 'question', 'Schrader', 'decision', 'speed', 'up', 'conclusion', 'Gigolo', 'are', 'lot', 'fast-forward', 'transitions', 'fade-out', 'fade-in', 'sequences', 'end', 'movie', 'clash', 'steady', 'pace', 'final', '15-20', 'minutes', 'also', 'question', 'Schrader', 'frequent', 'insertion', 'catchy', 'eventually', 'annoying', 'Call', 'Me', 'song', 'Blondie', 'even', 'purely', 'instrumental', 'renditions', 'was', 'about', 'blow', 'brains', 'out.All', 'said', 'American', 'Gigolo', 'well', 'enough']",American Gigolo

130580,AAYE34TCTNV2R,0792160347,MarlowesMom,"[3, 5]","I can't figure out why people--guys especially--seem to hate Richard Gere so much. I don't think he's the greatest actor of his generation or anything, and photographed from the wrong angle, he can look kind of creepy, especially when he was younger. (He has aged gracefully IMO.) But when cast within his range, he's capable, charismatic and attractive, and he seems able to laugh at himself. So really, I don't get the hate and I didn't dislike ""American Gigolo"" because of Richard Gere.Rather, I disliked ""American Gigolo,"" because it kept too much of a distance from its characters and its themes for the audience to engage with them. I had just read Joan Didion's ""Play It As It Lays,"" another indictment of the superficiality, materialism and spiritual deadness of affluent Southern California. That book was brilliant because its hard surfaces were fragile and you could reach in and touch its narrator's anguish. While writer-director Paul Schrader has done some great work (""Taxi Driver"" for instance), this story of Julian Kaye,  who sleeps with wealthy older women for money and gets caught in a web of suspicion after a client is murdered, never lets the viewer in deep enough to feel anything. You get subtle hints of Julian's malaise. He has stacks of pictures in his apartment that he flips through but never hangs on the wall. He expresses frustration that he can't do work other than be a male escort, but that doesn't even make sense because he shows a remarkable aptitude for learning languages. We know nothing of where he's from, what dreams he may have brought with him, or how or why he became what he is. Maybe his problem is that his ambition was misdirected in the first place and he thought having material stuff was all he would need to be fulfilled, but we never find out. He seems to have little in common, other than loneliness and physical attraction, with Michelle, the wife of an ambitious politician with whom he has an unpaid relationship (Lauren Hutton), so her enduring devotion to him and belief in his goodness doesn't make a lot of sense either.Maybe the movie would have worked better with Julie Christie playing Michelle (she was in talks at one point), but I doubt it.

130582,A152C8GYY25HAH,0792160347,Matthew Horner,"[10, 11]","""American Gigolo"" is high on my list of Guilty Pleasures. This 1980 thriller wallows in the troubles of the rich, the infamous and the decadent. Its main characters have too much money, which can be a good thing, and too much time on their hands, which can be a very bad thing. There is a sort of perverse pleasure in watching them sort through their various problems, most of which are indirectly of their own making. Writer-director Paul Schrader has always cast a cynical eye on human endeavors. Sometimes, his insights have been absolutely brilliant. [He wrote both "" Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"".] But even when he is playing around, as in ""American Gigolo"", he creates for us an interesting world, which can also be repellant because we see a certain amount of truth in his characterizations.Richard Gere is Julian Kaye, a very well paid [and apparently well educated] LA hustler. His specialty is wealthy, older women. Arrogant and self-assured, he has made his share of enemies in his shadowy world, especially among his pimps. Things get complicated for him when he falls for Michelle Stratton [Lauren Hutton], wife of a prominent political figure. But far worse is in store for him after a client is murdered and Julian becomes the number one suspect.Giorgio Moroder contributes a lively musical score - very 80s. John Bailey's cinematography is first-rate. He captures the vanity and vulnerability of Julian right from the opening shots, for example.This is one of those movies that has more detractors than admirers. To me, it is wildly entertaining in a dark comedy way. Its one big fault is a contrived happy ending, which is diametrically opposed to the tone of the rest of the movie.",4,Darkly comic thriller from Paul Schrader,1031443200,"09 8, 2002",2002,1701,"['American', 'Gigolo', 'high', 'list', 'Guilty', 'Pleasures', '1980', 'thriller', 'wallows', 'troubles', 'rich', 'infamous', 'decadent', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'bad', 'thing', 'sort', 'perverse', 'pleasure', 'watching', 'sort', 'various', 'problems', 'most', 'are', 'indirectly', 'own', 'making', 'Writer-director', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'always', 'cast', 'cynical', 'eye', 'human', 'endeavors', 'Sometimes', 'insights', 'have', 'been', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'wrote', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Raging', 'Bull', ']', 'even', 'when', 'playing', 'around', 'American', 'Gigolo', 'interesting', 'world', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'repellant', 'see', 'certain', 'amount', 'truth', 'characterizations.Richard', 'Gere', 'Julian', 'Kaye', 'very', 'well', 'paid', '[', 'apparently', 'well', 'educated', ']', 'LA', 'hustler', 'specialty', 'wealthy', 'older', 'women', 'Arrogant', 'self-assured', 'made', 'share', 'enemies', 'shadowy', 'world', 'especially', 'pimps', 'Things', 'get', 'complicated', 'when', 'Michelle', 'Stratton', '[', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', ']', 'wife', 'prominent', 'political', 'figure', 'far', 'worse', 'store', 'client', 'murdered', 'Julian', 'number', 'one', 'suspect.Giorgio', 'Moroder', 'lively', 'musical', 'score', 'very', '80s', 'John', 'Bailey', 'cinematography', 'first-rate', 'vanity', 'vulnerability', 'Julian', 'right', 'opening', 'shots', 'example.This', 'one', 'movies', 'more', 'detractors', 'admirers', 'wildly', 'entertaining', 'dark', 'comedy', 'way', 'one', 'big', 'fault', 'contrived', 'happy', 'ending', 'diametrically', 'opposed', 'tone', 'rest', 'movie']",American Gigolo

130591,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,0792160347,Richard Ross,"[6, 8]","'Taxi Driver' writer Paul Schrader wrote and directed this film about a male escort named Julian (Richard Gere) who romances a senator's wife (Lauren Hutton) and gets framed for murder. Besides the Scorsese classic, this is Schrader's second biggest credit. I've only seen a couple of his films as director, but I prefer him more as a writer. That isn't to say he isn't skilled behind the camera since this film does an excellent job of portraying a cold and shallow world of excess and consumerism and the even colder people who live in it. The story is intriguing and makes for a very suspenseful film. You feel as helpless as Julian as you wonder who could be framing him and why. Gere and Hutton are both good looking and each appear nude in the film. The best work though comes courtesy of supporting players like Bill Duke and Hector Elizondo. Duke is frightening as a shady pimp who contracts Julian for jobs catering to the kinky crowd. It is one of his clients who winds up murdered, so Julian naturally goes to him for help. He proves to be anything but loyal for  a friend. The single funnest performance is that of Hector Elizondo as Det. Sunday. Elizondo, chewing the scenery along with a giant cigar, is a hoot in his scenes with Gere. Sunday is in awe of Julian's hypnotic hold over women. In a clever plot twist, Julian agrees to trade style and grooming advice with Sunday for more lenient care when he becomes a murder suspect. The film builds to a surprising climax as we figure out who the murderer is and what happens to Julian. Boasting plenty of coke, Armani suits, and an amazing score from Giorgio Moroder the film is pretty entertaining but not the iconic 80's film I was expecting.",3,"""Call Me"" Crazy, But I Wasn't That Impressed",1251417600,"08 28, 2009",2009,1708,"[""'Taxi"", 'Driver', 'writer', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'wrote', 'directed', 'film', 'male', 'escort', 'named', 'Julian', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'who', 'senator', 'wife', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'framed', 'murder', 'Scorsese', 'classic', 'Schrader', 'second', 'biggest', 'credit', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'couple', 'films', 'director', 'prefer', 'more', 'writer', ""n't"", 'say', ""n't"", 'skilled', 'camera', 'film', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'cold', 'shallow', 'world', 'excess', 'consumerism', 'even', 'colder', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'story', 'intriguing', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'feel', 'as', 'helpless', 'as', 'Julian', 'wonder', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'framing', 'why', 'Gere', 'Hutton', 'are', 'good', 'looking', 'appear', 'nude', 'film', 'best', 'work', 'courtesy', 'supporting', 'players', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'Duke', 'frightening', 'shady', 'pimp', 'who', 'contracts', 'Julian', 'jobs', 'catering', 'kinky', 'crowd', 'one', 'clients', 'who', 'up', 'murdered', 'so', 'Julian', 'naturally', 'help', 'be', 'anything', 'loyal', 'friend', 'single', 'funnest', 'performance', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'Det', 'Sunday', 'Elizondo', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'giant', 'cigar', 'hoot', 'scenes', 'Gere', 'Sunday', 'awe', 'Julian', 'hypnotic', 'hold', 'women', 'clever', 'plot', 'twist', 'Julian', 'trade', 'style', 'grooming', 'advice', 'Sunday', 'more', 'lenient', 'care', 'when', 'murder', 'suspect', 'film', 'surprising', 'climax', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'murderer', 'what', 'Julian', 'Boasting', 'plenty', 'coke', 'Armani', 'suits', 'amazing', 'score', 'Giorgio', 'Moroder', 'film', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'not', 'iconic', '80', 'film', 'was', 'expecting']",American Gigolo

Richard Gere delivers his usual flat performance as the titular character, a walking billboard for all that's wrong with style over substance; here, though, his monotone facial expressions and speech actually work, as the character has the emotional range of his condo's designer furniture. Ironically, model-turned-actress Lauren Hutton delivers a surprisingly steady and honest performance as his love interest, despite having to utter lines that often barely rise above soap-opera level in quality. But the real star of the film is the production itself. The visual and aural model for what would become ""Miami Vice,"" the film still seems modern, crisp, and glossy, even with the poofy hairdos, micro-shirt collars and tinny hatchback cars. The story is little more than fluff; Gere's Julian is framed for murder, and Hutton--the wife of a bigwig politico with much to lose if their affair is discovered--is his only alibi. In a half-hearted attempt to infuse some much-needed moral fiber, Schrader forces Julian to confront the many people he's wronged, as well as the empty but expensive lie that is his life, including hints at the character's bisexuality (controversial stuff in 1980). Despite Hector Elizondo's caricature performance as a Columbo-esque detective and the fact that the film celebrates being shallow as much as it condemns such behavior, it scores some hits, not the least of which is the breezy opening song by Blondie.",4,Put Your Brain on Hold and Look at the Pretty Pictures,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,1584,"['early', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'effort', 'slick', 'vapid', 'city', 'set', 'still', 'strangely', 'compelling', 'years', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'usual', 'flat', 'performance', 'titular', 'character', 'walking', 'billboard', 'wrong', 'style', 'substance', 'here', 'though', 'monotone', 'facial', 'expressions', 'speech', 'actually', 'work', 'character', 'emotional', 'range', 'condo', 'designer', 'furniture', 'Ironically', 'model-turned-actress', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'surprisingly', 'steady', 'honest', 'performance', 'love', 'interest', 'having', 'utter', 'lines', 'often', 'barely', 'rise', 'soap-opera', 'level', 'quality', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'production', 'visual', 'aural', 'model', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'film', 'still', 'modern', 'crisp', 'glossy', 'even', 'poofy', 'hairdos', 'micro-shirt', 'collars', 'tinny', 'hatchback', 'cars', 'story', 'little', 'more', 'fluff', 'Gere', 'Julian', 'framed', 'murder', 'Hutton', 'wife', 'bigwig', 'politico', 'much', 'lose', 'affair', 'discovered', 'only', 'alibi', 'half-hearted', 'attempt', 'infuse', 'much-needed', 'moral', 'fiber', 'Schrader', 'forces', 'Julian', 'confront', 'many', 'people', 'wronged', 'as', 'well', 'empty', 'expensive', 'lie', 'life', 'including', 'hints', 'character', 'bisexuality', 'controversial', 'stuff', '1980', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', 'caricature', 'performance', 'Columbo-esque', 'detective', 'fact', 'film', 'being', 'shallow', 'as', 'much', 'such', 'behavior', 'hits', 'not', 'least', 'breezy', 'opening', 'song', 'Blondie']",American Gigolo

Mixing his admiration for European art cinema with a voyeuristic view of the seamier side of sex & affluence Schrader renders Julian an inscrutable emotionally disengaged purveyor of pleasure decked out in Giorgio Armani clothes coordinated with Ferdinando Scarfiotti's meticulous production design & lots of graphic nudity.Amid critical doubts about its artiness and distanced eroticism AMERICAN GIGALO surprised everyone by not dying on the box office vine when it was theatrically released in the Winter of 1980 with some audiences reportedly showing up for repeat viewings of Gere's seductive charms it became a moderate hit turning Gere into a star and Armani into the new fashion sensation.Whatever reservations one may have about the movie it provided two indelible images of 1980s decadence to come: Gere's perusing his artist's palette of shirts ties and jackets and Gere's cruising down the Pacific Coast Highway in his convertible to the New Wave strains of Blondie's ""Call Me"".Therefore, with nobody to help Julian, he ends up in jail awaiting trial for the murder, but when all seems lost, Michelle risks her own reputation and her husbands to provide Julian with the alibi that can save him from going to prison.",4,American Gigolo Rocks!,1229385600,"12 16, 2008",2008,1964,"['slick', 'L.A.', 'callboy', 'love', 'redemption', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'ultra-stylish', 'drama', 'High-living', 'prostitute', 'Julian', 'Kay', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'stepping', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Mercedes', 'clothes', 'access', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'swankiest', 'establishments', 'stable', 'rich', 'older', 'female', 'clients', 'apart', 'favor', 'former', 'pimp', 'Bill', 'Duke', 'trick', 'up', 'dead', 'short', 'while', 'later', 'Julian', 'actual', 'client', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'alibi', 'police', 'Det', 'Sunday', 'Hector', 'Elizondo', ""n't"", 'believe', 'gigolo', 'denials.The', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'frustrated', 'politician', 'wife', 'sole', 'non-paying', 'bedmate', 'Michelle', 'Lauren', 'Hutton', 'only', 'Julian', 'could', 'let', 'down', 'defenses', 'accept', 'gesture', 'love', 'Mixing', 'admiration', 'European', 'art', 'cinema', 'voyeuristic', 'view', 'seamier', 'side', 'sex', 'affluence', 'Schrader', 'renders', 'Julian', 'inscrutable', 'emotionally', 'disengaged', 'purveyor', 'pleasure', 'decked', 'out', 'Giorgio', 'Armani', 'clothes', 'coordinated', 'Ferdinando', 'Scarfiotti', 'meticulous', 'production', 'design', 'lots', 'graphic', 'nudity.Amid', 'critical', 'doubts', 'artiness', 'distanced', 'eroticism', 'AMERICAN', 'GIGALO', 'surprised', 'everyone', 'not', 'dying', 'box', 'office', 'vine', 'when', 'was', 'theatrically', 'released', 'Winter', '1980', 'audiences', 'reportedly', 'showing', 'up', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'Gere', 'seductive', 'charms', 'became', 'moderate', 'hit', 'turning', 'Gere', 'star', 'Armani', 'new', 'fashion', 'sensation.Whatever', 'reservations', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'movie', 'provided', 'two', 'indelible', 'images', '1980s', 'decadence', 'come', 'Gere', 'perusing', 'artist', 'palette', 'shirts', 'ties', 'jackets', 'Gere', 'cruising', 'down', 'Pacific', 'Coast', 'Highway', 'convertible', 'New', 'Wave', 'strains', 'Blondie', 'Call', 'Me', '.Therefore', 'nobody', 'help', 'Julian', 'up', 'jail', 'awaiting', 'trial', 'murder', 'when', 'lost', 'Michelle', 'own', 'reputation', 'husbands', 'provide', 'Julian', 'alibi', 'can', 'save', 'going', 'prison']",American Gigolo

American Gigolo is as good as I remember it being. It is about the framing for murder of a male prostitute. Richard Gere broke through in this film. Lauren Hutton was the female lead.

Aside from the music, which was a bit much at times, the movie was an okay thriller.  The ending was a little disappointing (spoiler: were they going to set him free?), but overall it kept my interest throughout the movie.  The basic premise of the movie is that Gere&#8217;s character is being framed for murder and none of his alibi&#8217;s will collaborate his story.  Because of that he is forced to try to get to bottom of things on his own.  If you&#8217;ve never seen the movie, and don&#8217;t mind a little nudity (male and female), you may want to give this one a chance.T.S.
