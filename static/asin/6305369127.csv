Teletubbies (like fingernails running down a chalkboard to me)as annoying as they are to grown ups-they keep the attention of the weee lil' ones and put that beautiful little smile right where it belongs!!! Recommend highly for ages 6 months to 2 1/2 years.,4,Eh OOOH!,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",2005,375,"['was', 'kids', 'first', 'video', 'most', 'favorite-they', 'watched', 'countless', 'hours', '.and', 'Teletubbies', 'fingernails', 'running', 'down', 'chalkboard', 'as', 'annoying', 'are', 'grown', 'ups-they', 'keep', 'attention', 'weee', 'lil', 'ones', 'put', 'beautiful', 'little', 'smile', 'right', 'where', 'Recommend', 'highly', 'ages', '6', 'months', '2', '1/2', 'years']",Teletubbies - Favorite Things VHS
462537,A30H2335OM7RD6,6305369127,"apoem ""apoem""","[10, 10]","What makes the Teletubbies so enjoyable for young children is their predictability. The opening section of this video is just that, predictable. The Teletubbies all gather together with their favorite things- but uh oh... someone has lost something. Each Teletubbie loses his/her favorite thing, as each items is found, they gather together again, only to find someone else has lost his/her favorite thing. And so it goes, until every favorite item has been lost and been found.The ship segment is my favorite segment: nice music and great graphics. My children both enjoy this segment. The boy, Ned riding his bike is very fun and reminds my son of how he enjoys riding bikes.I know there is controversy on the Teletubbies. However, I think they are cute and harmless. Surely they don't teach anything negative, they teach hugs and fun and sharing and caring, if they teach anything at all. Mainly I use this video (and all others and TV) as a time for my kids to wind down at the end of the day or just prior to nap. A short time to just sit and turn off their brains for a few minutes.Enjoy.",5,An excellent Teletubbie Video,1024185600,"06 16, 2002",2002,1094,"['What', 'Teletubbies', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'young', 'children', 'predictability', 'opening', 'section', 'video', 'just', 'predictable', 'Teletubbies', 'together', 'favorite', 'things-', 'uh', 'oh', 'someone', 'lost', 'something', 'Teletubbie', 'favorite', 'thing', 'items', 'found', 'gather', 'together', 'again', 'only', 'find', 'someone', 'else', 'lost', 'his/her', 'favorite', 'thing', 'favorite', 'item', 'been', 'lost', 'been', 'found.The', 'ship', 'segment', 'favorite', 'segment', 'nice', 'music', 'great', 'graphics', 'children', 'enjoy', 'segment', 'boy', 'Ned', 'riding', 'bike', 'very', 'fun', 'son', 'how', 'riding', 'bikes.I', 'know', 'controversy', 'Teletubbies', 'However', 'think', 'are', 'cute', 'harmless', 'Surely', 'do', ""n't"", 'teach', 'anything', 'negative', 'teach', 'hugs', 'fun', 'sharing', 'caring', 'teach', 'anything', 'Mainly', 'use', 'video', 'others', 'TV', 'time', 'kids', 'wind', 'down', 'end', 'day', 'just', 'prior', 'nap', 'short', 'time', 'just', 'sit', 'turn', 'off', 'brains', 'few', 'minutes.Enjoy']",Teletubbies - Favorite Things VHS

462539,A1IANEBSMVGHS9,6305369127,"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny""","[2, 2]","Let me set the record straight, for those of you who dislike these folks: I hated Teletubbies! I thought it was a foursome of weird characters, that couldn't talk well, etc... Well, while they continue to be weird (though you gotta admit they're kinda cute), and they still haven't gotten past the ""He-o!"" (for 'Hello!') one thing Laa-Laa, Tinky Winky, Dipsy and Po have done is make my baby laugh and calm down when cranky in a way only Baby Mozart is able to do. So all other criticism became secondary after I saw this happen over and over. He just loves it, so it's become one of the 2-3 official videos to be played while his mom and I fix breakfast, because it ""buys"" us enough time! :)This particular video has a particular story where all Teletubbies loose an item each: a ball, a bag, a hat and a scooter; to be found later on. What is interesting about it is the repetition within it: repetition of words in the dialogs, in the scenes during the searches for each item, etc. in a way that becomes educative, since the babies learn about patterns, things and colors in the process.If you haven't gotten yourself a copy of ""Baby Mozart"" I'd probably recommend you do that before, but if you already have that covered, you have to have Teletubbies' ""Favorite Things"".",5,"They make my baby smile, and that is worth everything!",1079222400,"03 14, 2004",2004,1274,"['Let', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'who', 'dislike', 'folks', 'hated', 'Teletubbies', 'thought', 'was', 'foursome', 'weird', 'characters', 'could', ""n't"", 'talk', 'well', 'etc', 'Well', 'continue', 'be', 'weird', 'got', 'ta', 'admit', ""'re"", 'kinda', 'cute', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'He-o', ""'Hello"", 'one', 'thing', 'Laa-Laa', 'Tinky', 'Winky', 'Dipsy', 'Po', 'have', 'done', 'make', 'baby', 'laugh', 'calm', 'down', 'when', 'cranky', 'way', 'only', 'Baby', 'Mozart', 'able', 'do', 'So', 'other', 'criticism', 'became', 'secondary', 'saw', 'happen', 'over', 'just', 'become', 'one', '2-3', 'official', 'videos', 'be', 'played', 'mom', 'fix', 'breakfast', 'buys', 'enough', 'time', 'particular', 'video', 'particular', 'story', 'where', 'Teletubbies', 'loose', 'item', 'ball', 'bag', 'hat', 'scooter', 'be', 'found', 'later', 'What', 'interesting', 'repetition', 'repetition', 'words', 'dialogs', 'scenes', 'searches', 'item', 'etc', 'way', 'educative', 'babies', 'learn', 'patterns', 'things', 'colors', 'process.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'copy', 'Baby', 'Mozart', ""'d"", 'probably', 'recommend', 'do', 'already', 'have', 'covered', 'have', 'have', 'Teletubbies', 'Favorite', 'Things']",Teletubbies - Favorite Things VHS

Sometimes I think they are starting to out grow the novelty of Tubbies, but they always eventually start asking for Teletubby videos ""again, again""! Teletubbies are very consistent, just what babies and toddlers desire and thrive on. This volume, like all others, has everything you expect from the television series format. The tubbies are always entertaining, kind, friendly, and love to have fun.
