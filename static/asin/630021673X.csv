222504,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,630021673X,Bomojaz,"[10, 11]","A very engaging movie about a young Jewish man (played by Richard Dreyfuss) who will do anything to make a buck, which is the only way he thinks he can be somebody. Dreyfuss, who is constantly on the verge of jumping out of his skin, is both funny and sad - and vulnerable. The movie has been accused of being anti-Semitic by some, but it's Duddy's single-minded brashness that is the focus here, not his religion. Drefuss is a joy to watch.",5,Funny and sad and very human,1127001600,"09 18, 2005",2005,441,"['very', 'engaging', 'movie', 'young', 'Jewish', 'man', 'played', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'make', 'buck', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'somebody', 'Dreyfuss', 'who', 'constantly', 'verge', 'jumping', 'skin', 'funny', 'sad', 'vulnerable', 'movie', 'been', 'accused', 'being', 'anti-Semitic', 'Duddy', 'single-minded', 'brashness', 'focus', 'here', 'not', 'religion', 'Drefuss', 'joy', 'watch']",Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz VHS

I would've  liked to see whether Duddy patched things up with Virgil the epileptic,played by Randy Quaid and Yvette,played beautifully by Micheline Langtot-and how things progressed in 'Kravitzville',which Duddy planned to name his resort-which he acquired by hook-and crook-and whether he made up with his 'Zaydeh' played by Zvi Schooler.In any case,this is one terrific-and honest-film.",5,Canada's most memorable film (easily),1151452800,"06 28, 2006",2006,891,"['Mordecai', 'Richler', 'great', 'novel', 'Duddy', 'Kravitz', 'drive', 'fulfill', 'grandfather', 'mantra-a', 'man', 'land', 'nothing', '-is', 'brilliantly', 'brought', 'life', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss-', 'best-', 'Duddy.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'brilliant', 'well', 'think', 'Joe', 'Silver', 'film', 'portrayal', 'scrapman', 'Mr.', 'Farber', 'only', 'regret', 'Richler', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'sequel', 'would', 'later', 'write', ""'Oh"", 'Canada', 'Oh', 'Quebec', 'think', 'still', 'premier', 'book', 'Quebec', 'rest', 'Canada', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'see', 'Duddy', 'patched', 'things', 'up', 'Virgil', 'epileptic', 'played', 'Randy', 'Quaid', 'Yvette', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Micheline', 'Langtot-and', 'how', 'things', 'progressed', ""'Kravitzville"", 'Duddy', 'planned', 'name', 'resort-which', 'acquired', 'hook-and', 'crook-and', 'made', 'up', ""'Zaydeh"", 'played', 'Zvi', 'Schooler.In', 'case', 'one', 'terrific-and', 'honest-film']",Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz VHS
222506,A28BCMMC6UX3TN,630021673X,Jeffrey Fried,"[0, 0]","The APPRENTICESHIP OF DUDDY KRAVITZ seemed so powerful to me. It  left me at that time with intangible  questions. The first question this film tried to  answer for me is ""What does a man/person have to do to gain the respect of his  family and the people in his life"".It seemed like an important question to me . In fact the answer to this question isThis movie shows  WHAT NOT to do to gain their respect.The second question I pondered and still do is "" when to stop pushing for growth and let it happen naturally"".Better put by the song "" There is a time ....... to let things happen"" Yes I am a child of the seventies.Duddy lives in a jewish community in Montreal circa 1950. He is a recent high school graduate from a working class ,motherless family. The only member who actual has a place in their heart for Duddy is his zeda (grandgather in yiddish). He.listens to his zeda as if his words are gems and the path to respectability. ""A man must have his own land .This is self respect.As there is no one else to guide him or for that matter care for and about him. So begins our ride to Duddys respectability..The film takes us on the quest to own land and therefore respectability. On this quest we are introduced to some real characters. Jack Warden ,Duddys dad , as always a pleasure to watch him at his craft. Another cast member is the super baritone Joe Silver ,a great charactet actor you need to see before you say I know him.Duddy develops several friendships but doesnt know what frienship means. Here is where you can ask yourself ""what is a friend and how far out does a person have to go to show it "".Ee are given lots of laughs on the way .The best is british great Denholm Elliot as a movie producer and flm maker of Bar Mitzvot and Jewish weddings. Really funny. The pathos is between his friends and family. At the end we are still left with the feeling whether or not Duddy has achieved his goal by his standards.This movie is Richards  Dreyfus first film with the leading  role on film . For you trivia buffs he is in The Graduate with a line.Over the years Richard Dreyfus has given us a great body of work and ,in film, it starts here.Another film about respectability and self worth is Lies my Father Told Me.",5,It is my Catcher in the Rye in film,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,2237,"['APPRENTICESHIP', 'OF', 'DUDDY', 'KRAVITZ', 'seemed', 'so', 'powerful', 'left', 'time', 'intangible', 'questions', 'first', 'question', 'film', 'tried', 'answer', 'What', 'man/person', 'have', 'do', 'gain', 'respect', 'family', 'people', 'life', '.It', 'seemed', 'important', 'question', 'fact', 'answer', 'question', 'isThis', 'movie', 'WHAT', 'NOT', 'do', 'gain', 'respect.The', 'second', 'question', 'pondered', 'still', 'do', 'when', 'stop', 'pushing', 'growth', 'let', 'happen', 'naturally', '.Better', 'put', 'song', 'time', 'let', 'things', 'happen', 'Yes', 'am', 'child', 'seventies.Duddy', 'lives', 'jewish', 'community', 'Montreal', 'circa', '1950', 'recent', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'working', 'class', 'motherless', 'family', 'only', 'member', 'who', 'actual', 'place', 'heart', 'Duddy', 'zeda', 'grandgather', 'yiddish', 'zeda', 'words', 'are', 'gems', 'path', 'respectability', 'man', 'must', 'have', 'own', 'land', '.This', 'self', 'respect.As', 'one', 'else', 'guide', 'matter', 'care', 'So', 'ride', 'Duddys', 'respectability..The', 'film', 'quest', 'own', 'land', 'therefore', 'respectability', 'quest', 'are', 'introduced', 'real', 'characters', 'Jack', 'Warden', 'Duddys', 'dad', 'always', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'craft', 'cast', 'member', 'super', 'baritone', 'Joe', 'Silver', 'great', 'charactet', 'actor', 'need', 'see', 'say', 'know', 'him.Duddy', 'several', 'friendships', 'doesnt', 'know', 'what', 'frienship', 'Here', 'where', 'can', 'ask', 'what', 'friend', 'how', 'far', 'out', 'person', 'have', 'go', 'show', '.Ee', 'are', 'given', 'lots', 'laughs', 'way', '.The', 'best', 'british', 'great', 'Denholm', 'Elliot', 'movie', 'producer', 'flm', 'maker', 'Bar', 'Mitzvot', 'Jewish', 'weddings', 'Really', 'funny', 'pathos', 'friends', 'family', 'end', 'are', 'still', 'left', 'feeling', 'not', 'Duddy', 'achieved', 'goal', 'standards.This', 'movie', 'Richards', 'Dreyfus', 'first', 'film', 'leading', 'role', 'film', 'trivia', 'buffs', 'Graduate', 'line.Over', 'years', 'Richard', 'Dreyfus', 'given', 'great', 'body', 'work', 'film', 'here.Another', 'film', 'respectability', 'self', 'worth', 'Lies', 'Father', 'Told', 'Me']",Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz VHS
222507,A205XI0CN5RMLP,630021673X,"J. Figler ""jfigl""","[16, 16]","...and pulls him out from under us.The  back of the ""Duddy Kravitz"" VHS box alleges that Duddy ""uses the girl who loves him, forges checks, and lies but somehow still manages to work his way into our hearts.""  To describe the film this way misses its uniqueness by inverting its point.  Richard Dreyfuss' charismatic,  touching, and wildly comic performance  (the key performance of his career, and little-seen),  effortlessly and immediately batters its way into our hearts.  The process by which Duddy squanders those affections and the affections of those around him (perhaps most tragically Yvette's and Virgil's)  is incremental, painful, and, we have no reason to suppose otherwise, irreversible.  Only gradually does it become clear that he draws no distinction between people and objects - both are merely means to an end.  The VHS blurb suggests a redemption, a feel-good experience  that's nowhere to be found in this film.  Duddy not only betrays other characters; he betrays the audience,  truly and distressingly.  Despite his energy and intelligence and charm, this punk manages to work his way out of our hearts.At what point does the viewer cut him dead?  Or does Duddy continue (see review below) to seem ""inspiring""?  The film doesn't insist, to its credit, on any one answer to those questions.  Along with the enormous amount of physical energy at his disposal,  Duddy possesses a prodigious, caustic wit which he frequently unloads on those who would directly challenge him.  The brilliance of the film is that these harangues are so sympathetically written and masterfully performed that viewers may not know what to make of them, other than to mistake them for ringing endorsements of Duddy's behavior.",5,"Daringly takes our ""audience-identification figure""...",1065657600,"10 9, 2003",2003,1725,"['pulls', 'out', 'us.The', 'back', 'Duddy', 'Kravitz', 'VHS', 'box', 'Duddy', 'girl', 'who', 'checks', 'somehow', 'still', 'work', 'way', 'hearts', 'describe', 'film', 'way', 'uniqueness', 'inverting', 'point', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'charismatic', 'touching', 'wildly', 'comic', 'performance', 'key', 'performance', 'career', 'little-seen', 'effortlessly', 'immediately', 'batters', 'way', 'hearts', 'process', 'Duddy', 'squanders', 'affections', 'affections', 'perhaps', 'most', 'tragically', 'Yvette', 'Virgil', 'incremental', 'painful', 'have', 'reason', 'suppose', 'otherwise', 'irreversible', 'Only', 'gradually', 'become', 'clear', 'distinction', 'people', 'are', 'merely', 'end', 'VHS', 'blurb', 'redemption', 'feel-good', 'experience', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'Duddy', 'not', 'only', 'other', 'characters', 'audience', 'truly', 'distressingly', 'energy', 'intelligence', 'charm', 'punk', 'work', 'way', 'hearts.At', 'what', 'point', 'viewer', 'cut', 'dead', 'Duddy', 'continue', 'see', 'review', 'seem', 'inspiring', 'film', ""n't"", 'insist', 'credit', 'one', 'answer', 'questions', 'enormous', 'amount', 'physical', 'energy', 'disposal', 'Duddy', 'prodigious', 'caustic', 'wit', 'frequently', 'who', 'would', 'directly', 'challenge', 'brilliance', 'film', 'harangues', 'are', 'so', 'sympathetically', 'written', 'masterfully', 'performed', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'other', 'mistake', 'ringing', 'endorsements', 'Duddy', 'behavior']",Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz VHS
