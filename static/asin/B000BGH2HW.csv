The plot is rather quirky to say the least. Things go down hill when Shirley's character tell's a whopper of a lie to get out of trouble and when another lie she's told is added to the mix... the results are disastrous.

941839,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B000BGH2HW,Byron Kolln,"[18, 18]","ALMOST A BRIDE (aka ""A Kiss for Corliss"") provides a fitting finale to Shirley Temple's screen career.  This was a sequel to the popular ""Kiss and Tell"", in which Temple first played the lovesick teen Corliss Archer.In this delightful film, Corliss becomes infatuated with the handsome and worldly playboy Kenneth Marquis (David Niven).  She decides to get even with her boyfriend Dexter (Darryl Hickman) and write some steamy - and fake - sections about Kenneth in her diary.  Complications arise when the diary falls into the hands of Kenneth and her parents.  Naturally her parents are mortified, but Kenneth decides to have a little fun and play along with Corliss' games, so he places an article in the paper announcing his engagement to her!  Fantastic support is provided by Tom Tully, Gloria Holden, Kathryn Card and Robert Ellis (who would later go on to play Dexter in the short-lived television sitcom ""Meet Corliss Archer"").Temple is ideally-suited to Corliss and the entire film is a bright and breezy delight.  Had Temple continued her film career, she would have been sensational as a screwball comedienne.  Sadly audiences could not (or indeed would not) accept that little ""Curly Top"" was all grown up and ready for more challenging roles, and thus Temple retreated from the screen.  Still, it's great to see this film surfacing on DVD (through the 'Cinema Deluxe' label from Geneon Entertainment) at a bargain price.If you enjoyed this film, you will also love the television sitcom ""Meet Corliss Archer"".

The plot is typical of the teen comedies of the time: Shirley invents a steamy romance to make her boyfriend jealous; she is out all night and feigns amnesia to avoid punishment.  The twist here is David Niven, playing a well-to-do middle-aged man who has married a string of young women and is shocked, shocked to discover they only wanted him for his money.  Niven is annoyed that Corliss' dad tried to prosecute him on a morals charge.  When Corliss is discovered missing, her parents search her diary for clues to where she might be.  They read Corliss' imaginary love affair with Niven and confront him.  However, unlike Cary Grant in &#34;The Bachelor and the Bobbysoxer,&#34;  Niven pretends the romance with the young girl is real -- even getting others to back him up.This however is no &#34;Bachelor.&#34;  Except for Temple and Niven, the cast is guilty of some of the worst overacting you've ever seen.  The plot is nonsense: Corliss' dad tried to send Niven to jail for taking advantage of young women, then allows his teenaged daughter to marry him?  Niven's character is even more ludicrous.  Bored at his trial, yet angry enough to risk the consequences of pretending to make love to an underaged girl?  It's hard to be sympathetic to a guy who casually casts off his ex-wives, claiming that he is the true victim, but flirts with a teenager before the diary/amnesia occurs.Recommended for Temple / Niven or 50's teen comedy fans only.",3,Bachelor & Bobbysoxer -- in reverse ?,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,1546,"['grown-up', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'Corliss', 'Archer', 'based', 'popular', 'radio', 'program', 'time', 'plot', 'typical', 'teen', 'comedies', 'time', 'Shirley', 'steamy', 'romance', 'make', 'boyfriend', 'jealous', 'out', 'night', 'feigns', 'amnesia', 'avoid', 'punishment', 'twist', 'here', 'David', 'Niven', 'playing', 'well-to-do', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'who', 'married', 'string', 'young', 'women', 'shocked', 'shocked', 'discover', 'only', 'wanted', 'money', 'Niven', 'annoyed', 'Corliss', 'dad', 'tried', 'prosecute', 'morals', 'charge', 'When', 'Corliss', 'discovered', 'missing', 'parents', 'search', 'diary', 'clues', 'where', 'might', 'be', 'read', 'Corliss', 'imaginary', 'love', 'affair', 'Niven', 'confront', 'However', 'Cary', 'Grant', '34', 'Bachelor', 'Bobbysoxer', '34', 'Niven', 'romance', 'young', 'girl', 'real', 'even', 'getting', 'others', 'back', 'up.This', 'however', '34', 'Bachelor.', '34', 'Except', 'Temple', 'Niven', 'cast', 'guilty', 'worst', 'overacting', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'plot', 'nonsense', 'Corliss', 'dad', 'tried', 'send', 'Niven', 'jail', 'taking', 'advantage', 'young', 'women', 'then', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'marry', 'Niven', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'ludicrous', 'Bored', 'trial', 'yet', 'angry', 'enough', 'risk', 'consequences', 'pretending', 'make', 'love', 'underaged', 'girl', 'hard', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'guy', 'who', 'casually', 'ex-wives', 'claiming', 'true', 'victim', 'flirts', 'teenager', 'diary/amnesia', 'occurs.Recommended', 'Temple', '/', 'Niven', '50', 'teen', 'comedy', 'fans', 'only']",Almost a Bride

Most DVDs have a grainy appearance when viewed on any screen bigger than 19-inch.  They were probably manufactured before the era of large-screen high def TVs.The audio seemed a little low to me, but my wife says she could hear it fine.One other thing, in case nobody else has mentioned it:  ""Almost A Bride"" was not the title of this movie when it was released in 1949.  It was called ""A Kiss For Corliss"", and that's how you'll see it listed in most Shirley Temple filmographies.It's not really a sequel to 1945's ""Kiss And Tell"", but just another plot involving the same characters, but not the same actors playing them as in ""Kiss And Tell"".Shirley and her mother constantly strove to get diverse roles for Shirley.

A father decides to give his daughter away in marriage to a man he has doubts about and is 20 years her senior -- based on a flimsy story about a dubious entry in a diary, an amnesia story, and some convenient assertions by a millionaire who just wants to have a little sport playing mind-games.But if the viewer will just enjoy Shirley Temple's beautiful eyes, frowns, smiles, lips, slim waist, and oh so enchanting glances, and go with the flow, there's at least a few chuckles for him or her, particularly in the middle of this light farce.There are some self-referential symbols to Shirley Temple's previous work. Darryl Hickman does about a ten second tap dance behind Miss Temple as she's seated in a chair. Then she opens up a gift of nightgowns and finds one labeled &#34;Kiss and Tell.&#34;Another aspect of this movie that is not believable is that Corliss Archer is supposed to be 17, but Shirley Temple is clearly 21.

She secretly confesses to her diary an imagined relationship with wealthy, though frequently married, Kenneth Marquis (David Niven), 20 years her senior. Out of spite for a despised Mr. Archer, attorney for his last wife, Marquis confirms the story after Corliss's parents discover the diary. Wedding plans ensue. This leads to a public scandal and jealous true boyfriend, Dexter Franklin (Darryl Hickman).It seems the only roles offered to teenage Temple were ones where she nurtured affections for mature men. (THE BACHELOR AND THE BOBBY-SOXER, 1947;I'LL BE SEEING YOU, 1945) Though she likely wanted to play more womanly parts, from her youth she was type cast as a precocious girl. The quality of this delightful B+W film is surprisingly poor (fair w/o digital restoration) considering it is the treasured climax of Temple theater. This was a wonderful vehicle for prolific child-star Hickman's unbridled antics which were much more subdued inLEAVE HER TO HEAVEN(1945) and too brief inTHE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS(1946).

We can tolerate The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer, but this one, Almost a Bride, was almost too painful to watch. It started off okay, though a bit slow, but quickly got dumb and who wants to watch a father yelling all the time? And it is especially aggrivating when people believe lies instead of the truth. Toward the end I was just about ready to turn it off, it got so bad. I am glad I only paid $5.99 for it, so I don't feel so bad about that. Shirley was a nice looking young woman and it is too bad she didn't do more films at this stage in her life. She had the potential, I think, to do much better material than this. I admit I like her little girl roles much better. If you are a David Niven or Shirley Temple fan, you will probably want this film in your collection. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it unless you are a person who just likes aggrivating movies.",2,"One of those aggrivating ""comedies""",1165708800,"12 10, 2006",2006,1082,"['enjoy', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'films', 'house', 'beginnings', 'short', 'films', 'where', 'little', 'diaper', 'huge', 'pin', 'teenage', 'roles', 'such', ""'ll"", 'Be', 'Seeing', 'Went', 'Away', 'can', 'tolerate', 'Bachelor', 'Bobby-Soxer', 'one', 'Almost', 'Bride', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'painful', 'watch', 'started', 'off', 'okay', 'bit', 'slow', 'quickly', 'got', 'dumb', 'who', 'watch', 'father', 'yelling', 'time', 'especially', 'aggrivating', 'when', 'people', 'believe', 'instead', 'truth', 'end', 'was', 'just', 'about', 'ready', 'turn', 'off', 'got', 'so', 'bad', 'am', 'glad', 'only', 'paid', '5.99', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'bad', 'Shirley', 'was', 'nice', 'looking', 'young', 'woman', 'too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'films', 'stage', 'life', 'had', 'potential', 'think', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'material', 'admit', 'little', 'girl', 'roles', 'much', 'better', 'are', 'David', 'Niven', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'fan', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'film', 'collection', 'Otherwise', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'are', 'person', 'who', 'just', 'aggrivating', 'movies']",Almost a Bride
