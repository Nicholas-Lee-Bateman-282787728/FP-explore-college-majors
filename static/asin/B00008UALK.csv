I'm going to say upfront that I was an instant fan and based on my readin ,he has starred in most of the top grossing Bollywood films in the last 20 years. So starting with Ek Tha Tiger ..I have watched in reverse.  I have to say that Hum Aapke Hain Koun pull all the pieces of Hindi romance, culture, and song together in this movie.  The more contemporary films had some elements - this film has it all.  I loved the story of love, sacrifice, and family. I enjoyed the courting and the wedding and the baby shower scenes, and the humor - all so wonderful  !  I thought the costumes and the haircuts were on target for the time period - unlike some other Bolly films where I wondered how did the costumer for Anne of Green Gables end up in India... and why are they wearing Satin and Lace ? Even so, I find the genre refreshing and just a good way to spend 3 hours...lol.If you have a short attention span ( 90 minutes or less) then stay away from Bollywood - you won't make it.  But if you can and you want to start watching...Hum Aspke Hain Koun is a good place to start to introduce you to what you will see in coming movies - once your are hooked - you're hooked !And yes, the picture quality wasn't that great, and yes, the subtitles dropped in and out and word usage was often off - but you got the message and it wasn't enough for me to say I won't watch it again.  Actually watching on the computer isn't bad - the movie doesn't pixelate.

747465,A31SXTK3FGIQHS,B00008UALK,G. T. Bysshe,"[0, 1]","This is the last review of a series of pieces on Husain:  the book:(Barefoot Across the Nation: M. F. Husain and the Idea of India); the movie: (Gaja Gamini);  the movie:  (Meenaxi: A Tale of 3 Cities).[See images posted on the Product Page for this movie review.]HAHK was the highest grossing film of 1994, and one of the most awarded films in all categories.  M.F. Husain, 76 years old at the time, became an immediate fan, along with millions of others, of the actress Madhuri Dixit.But Husain did something other fans did not- he continued to go to the movie over and over. (67 times by Wiki count)  He invited friends, danced in the isles, threw his signature paintbrush at the screen, and finally engaged the actress herself and proposed to make a movie (of her?) with her, which came to pass as GAJA GAMINI.Husain was a super-fan in his appraisal of Madhuri, enhanced by his money and position, the product of his lifelong success as a painter and public personality. This alone may have been sufficient to propel him to think that he could fulfill a life-long ambition to make a movie of his own, and that Madhuri would not only be the star of it, but also be a star because of it, in his mind.Kinship researcher and writer Patricia Uberoi treats the subject of Husain and his obsession with HAHK and Madhuri in her article ""The Bliss of Madhuri: Husain and his Muse"" ( in:Barefoot Across the Nation: M. F. Husain and the Idea of India).  Uberoi does not speak to Husain's character, but the movie itself.  Using feminist issues of ""scopophilia"", and focusing primarily on the song in the movie ""Dede Tera Devar Deewana"", and its performers/characters Nisha (Madhuri Dixit) and Prem (Salman Khan), she interprets this lively spoof of an Indian pregnancy party as a lascivious performance on the part of Nisha, impersonating her pregnant sister, and a demonstration of scopophilia by  Prem, brother-in-law of the pregnant mother being roasted, secret admirer of her sister Nisha, and general male gate-crasher/spy/master of disruptive activities on the all-women's affair. (Secretly the script of this number and the elaborate mis-en-scene  reminds me Gilbert & Sullivan's best comedy.  In India too forward flirting with women is viewed as  a lack in a man, for which Prem is severely berated in this scene.  All the while, Prem is chanting, ""This is the age of women!"" : see images)By extension Uberoi implies that Husain saw Nisha through Prem's eyes- and more importantly- that he used Prem's ""eyes"" to internalize a significance to Madhuri Dixit as an object whom he later ""specularizes"" - that this was the mechanism that made her his ""muse"".  This ""muse"" word  (murky at best) which was used by Husain  without a lot of recollection of its history in the arts of the west, stuck to the appraisal of the movie, GAJA GAMINI,  reviewers calling it nothing more than Husain's preoccupation with the actress herself.As much as this appears to explain how Husain might have moved from HAHK's scene with Madhuri's sari shown from the back to the Paris performance art  of Madhuri walking the boulevards as Mona Lisa, and the movie GAJA GAMINI itself,  this is not the whole story.In regards to the Dede Tera Devar Deewana scene and especially in the scene following directly after, I would maintain that Husain saw what was visible to the rest of the audience as a whole- that in the following scene Prem exculpates himself from spying on women, and shifts his actions to being nothing more than  a viewer in the audience seeking to see her dance.  Husain can take this point-of-view not only as consistent with the audience's opinion of Prem, but also a ""public domain""- it is written  into the script.  If a character  commits scopophilia independently of a script that exculpates him, this indicts the makers of the film, and since this is the audiences' film too,  it indicts the audience as well.This script does not explain Husain's ecstasy.  To do that, we have to tell another story, about another movie- Karz, 1980.---------KARZ 1980Because Husain was an avid movie fan, he likely saw Karz- though we do know anything about that.  It was an acclaimed picture of its time by Subhash Ghaii, ""showman of Hindi films, for making epic films that portray grandeur and very rich themes."" (wiki)--  This approach mirrored Husain's art in that it openly sought to solidify a national audience.I think Monty (Rishi Kapoor), a character crippled with a severe pre-cognitive recognition of somebody else's life, i.e. re-incarnation , would have resonated with Husain.  Some of the situations in KARZ might be seen as relevant to Husain's life.I understand re-incarntion when it is defined as the ""recognition"" of aspects of human existential conditions in others - being both a genetic and species specific experience.  Intuition about these things is recognition.  And in Buddhist terms, recognition is  re-incarnation, i.e. ""He/she is the re-incarnation of....""  Or in western speech ""he is ...(present-participle)...incarnate,"" sticking with Heidigger's present-particple of ""being"" in the phrase ""Sein und Zeit"".  Re-incarnation is some aspect of being that is conferred upon you, while at the same time, being part of you.Monty was an orphan- Husain was partially an orphan- or at least carried the affect of an orphan.  This ""lack"" is evident in Husain's many testimonies, trying to remember what his mother looked like, rifling through her sari's, and including the picture (of lack) he made of his step mother aunt. (see image)Monty experiences severe mental attacks associated with his incipient recognition which is metaphorically presented by Subhash Ghai in the scene of Monty resorting to alcohol in the throws of his disturbance, with a Sivakasi art print, hanging conspicuously on the wall behind his head , of a woman sucking a child. (see image)This is not just some happenstance of set design, but a literal metaphor of Subhash Ghai's for Monty's object of thought. As the movie progresses, and the mother, and daughter are revealed, Monty gets to meet his ""mother"" via the recognition they have for each other.  It is the line of the Mother (Druga Khote) that is resonant: ""He (Monty) can cheat everyone, but not a mother's heart.""To Husain, what a Mother's heart might consist of is JUST THE THING HE IS FORCED TO IMAGINE, OR LEARN TO RECOGNIZE elsewhere, because it is the very thing that was never replaced after his own mother'a death.  He may have talked about not knowing what she looked like, but that is code, from a lack of recognition of what was missing.-----------------BACK TO HAHK:It is just this recognition, this sight, seeing, that occurs in Husain while watching HAHK when Madhuri quite naturally shows her complete affection for here deceased sister's baby....Director Soora Barjatya, and cinematographer Rajan Kinagi turn this scene into A GEM OF SUSTAINED SPECULARITY which Husain viewed many, many times, as perhaps others do when returning to view this film. (see image)Without any barrier or defense, without any diminution of what would be, by this time, his total attention, the image enters Husain and becomes the demonstration of a real meaning of his mother, understandably transferred to him only in the form and person of Madhuri on screen.To occupy this point of view, in this picture, Husain is not the character of Prem at all.  There is no scopophilia.  The ""eyes"" of recognition through which M.F.Husain sees the meaning of the loss, the ""substance"" of the lack, as a dimension of his life  are the eyes of the baby, the baby in Madhuri's arms.  Over and over and over.  Sixty-seven times.....This is not akin to the physical evidences of his mother (the Maharastrian saris) which he repeated searched through as a youth,  things he reached for to touch. This is a presence with comes directly to him-  through his eyes.Husain's tribute to Madhuri in 2007 in buying out an entire theatre of her new film Aaja Nacle is an act of artistic respect and solidarity for her and her return to India.  But it also must have been an act of gratitude for a person that quite unconsciously gave him something he needed, that visualization, to finally close his pursuit of a mother's identity.",4,How

747466,A9T0DBHRUV2N7,B00008UALK,Lee Jilek,"[3, 3]","Hum Aapke Hain Koun is a 3 hour movie that maybe should have been 4 hours long.  Many of the scenes are energetic and move at a blistering pace just to get everything said and done, which is why some might think the acting is lacking.  The actors just are not given time to properly work many of the scenes. Some of the transitions between scenes are so abrupt that we almost get whiplash.  The camera work is very good and the image quality is adequate.  The sound is sub-today-standard and almost poor on 1 or 2 of the songs, but they are great songs.  Be prepared to speed read and watch scenes several times just to see everything. Based on movies that I have seen, at least 10 important later films were influenced by this film.All that said, I highly recommend this absolutely adorable film for what it is, not what it isn't.  It is a family film.  There is great love between 2 brothers and 2 sisters. True love develops between the couple in the arranged marriage. There is intense electricity between Madhuri and Salmon as their love develops.  There is the Indian version of a pooh-pooh cushion (crunchy chips under a blanket). There is a wonderful subplot where Madhuri and the young girls play the game steel-the-groom's-shoes during the wedding. A little white dog is a cute and important character.  There is a ton of soul lifting laughter in this film as characters and guests laugh at the antics of the main characters.  And, my all time favorite, you never really know for sure who or how many will eventually get married in one of these films.The negative reviewers do make some points.  If this film were remade with today's sound quality, choreography, film quality and directing it would be a tremendous film.

747467,A2PVZJY7E6454H,B00008UALK,"Lyn ""Lyn""","[6, 6]","This is generally a much loved Bollywood movie released in 1994. I think it has to be assessed within that time-frame.It has all the simplicity and naivete that Hollywood did in the 50s and early 60s. Its the sort of movie Doris Day would have starred in in terms of nice people and family values. It has scenes such as two whole families sitting in a circle and playing a game of pass the cushion and when the music stops the person holding it has to perform some forfeit piece of poetry or music. Now this tells you something about the times in itself.It is a long movie and there are many more songs than you tend to get these days. The songs were generally lively but I haven't felt tempted to download them. I did find the movie went on a bit at times though I know not all viewers felt that.It is a piece that informs a lot about Indian customs with quite long scenes laying out cultural practices around weddings and allied rituals. These are people who put family first and will sacrifice personal desires for family sake. The families intermarried are idyllic except for an aunt who provides selfish, greedy contrast.I came to Salman Khan movies this millennium and its interesting to see him younger. He is less self-conscious here and dances a lot better.

Now, it's climactic-critical scene in the movie is truly heartbreaking and I didn't really like that so much, but if you can rally from such a thing then they did it well. Now, I got the movie because I'm all crazy about Salman Khan and he certainly impresses in this film too! Because all the actors do such great jobs and have such great and equally important roles, his may not seem as prominent at times but even that is a new facet to his acting charm. What was a surprise in this movie for me was how much I enjoyed Madhuri Dixit in her role. I've seen her in a few other movies and she was good but nothing in those rolls really captured my heart, but she did in this one. She plays it to perfection. She was just so natural and yet so charmingly sweet and funny. In the scenes with the baby, she really came across as a loving mother. It was truly a beautiful sight. Speaking of which, Salman Khan looked like a wonderful loving uncle; in line to be a great dad. Now as for the movie feed itself, on my computer full screen did not fully cover my computer screen. I had a rectangle with a broader rectangle boarder on the outside. It was annoying but I still enjoyed the movie. You should also know, that for whatever reason, sometimes all the characters in a scene did not fully appear on the scene.

It was too loud, too long, and full of so many unnecessary details, characters, songs, and dialogue that I couldn't sit through the whole thing in one-go. I really like the director when he keeps his movies simple and basic like he did in Vivah, but when he decides to clutter up the story like he did here, the entire movie loses the warmth, charm, and incredible lessons of good values he's famous for. Also, I really disliked the cheap language, and rather risqu&eacute; (for Bollywood) antics. Not that I'm a prude, but they didn't fit with the theme of the story at all.As for the performances, Mr. Khan, and Ms. Dixit, did not make me care about them in any way. I didn't find either engaging or the least bit sympathetic. They each have a certain smugness in their screen presence that I resented a lot. An attitude of &#34;I'm SK, or I'm MD look at me, of course you love me, I don't have to do anything but smile and I'm the best.&#34; Um I'm sorry, but not this girl. To be fair, yes, Ms. Dixit is exceptionally talented, but as for Mr. Khan... I still can't see why he's so popular. He can't dance, his &#34;acting&#34; is mediocre at best, and he's average looking without the bulky muscles and terrifying with them.I think he's an incredible producer, he knows the business of movies probably almost better than anyone in Bollywood, he should really stick to making movies like Chiller Party Gang and stop trying to be a hero.

Unfortunately tragedy strikes when Pooja dies shortly after the birth of her first child. The elder males feel that it would be best for Nisha to marry her widowed bro-in-law [common in many traditional societies] so as to provide the motherless child with a loving substitute mommy. Unbeknownst to the other family members, Prem and Nisha are deeply in love, and they decide to sacrifice their love for the sake of the family [another common thread in many Bollywood movies]. The rest of the story deals with what happens to the star-crossed lovers.Though the plot is not extraordinary, what lifts this movie above the average Bollywood blockbuster is the excellent songs & dances that lend a melodious harmony to the movie itself, whilst not detracting from the actual story.
