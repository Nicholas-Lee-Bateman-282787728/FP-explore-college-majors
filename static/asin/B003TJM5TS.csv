That's what happened for me with ""Criminal Minds.""  I don't know how I missed it.  It must have been showing opposite something else I used to watch (before the days of my DVR).  But I heard about the show and it sounded like something I would really like - and I was so right.FBI, behavior analysts, serial killers and more serial killers.  Pretty gruesome at times, some episodes are downright shivery.  Perfect casting although I do have to say I miss Mandy Patinkin, one of my favorite actors, who was in the first couple of seasons.  I want to be best friends with ""Penelope Garcia"" - love her character.I just finished watching all five seasons in an ultra marathon.  Now all kinds of people are asking to borrow the set.  Hmmm, I'd better get them all back.A couple of technical issues - I played these discs on our Play Station 3 player.  There was one disc that the remote for the PSP3 wouldn't work on and I had to play it in the old DVD/VCR player.  The remote for that plater worked fine on it.Now I am partially deaf and I use Closed Captioning when available.  Closed Captioning does not show as an option on any of these discs and did not work when I played in the Play Station player.  BUT when I used the old DVD/VCR player that runs through the television, Closed Captioning showed up.  ??????  So I had to choose between much better picture quality vs. Closed Captioning.  I am not very tech minded - my husband wires all this stuff up - so I don't know whether there is a way to wire the PSP3 through the TV so the Closed Captioning works.But anyway, I am very glad I got this set.  I enjoyed each and every episode.  That doesn't happen often.",5,Not ONE episode I didn't like/Closed Captioning,1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,1749,"[""n't"", 'great', 'when', 'find', 'new', 'television', 'show', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'what', 'happened', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'missed', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'showing', 'opposite', 'something', 'else', 'used', 'watch', 'days', 'DVR', 'heard', 'show', 'sounded', 'something', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'was', 'so', 'right.FBI', 'behavior', 'analysts', 'serial', 'killers', 'more', 'serial', 'killers', 'Pretty', 'gruesome', 'times', 'episodes', 'are', 'downright', 'shivery', 'Perfect', 'casting', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'miss', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'want', 'be', 'best', 'friends', 'Penelope', 'Garcia', 'love', 'character.I', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'five', 'seasons', 'ultra', 'marathon', 'Now', 'kinds', 'people', 'are', 'asking', 'borrow', 'set', 'Hmmm', ""'d"", 'better', 'get', 'back.A', 'couple', 'technical', 'issues', 'played', 'discs', 'Play', 'Station', '3', 'player', 'was', 'one', 'disc', 'remote', 'PSP3', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'had', 'play', 'old', 'DVD/VCR', 'player', 'remote', 'plater', 'worked', 'fine', 'it.Now', 'am', 'partially', 'deaf', 'use', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'when', 'available', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'not', 'show', 'option', 'discs', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'when', 'played', 'Play', 'Station', 'player', 'when', 'used', 'old', 'DVD/VCR', 'player', 'television', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'showed', 'up', 'had', 'choose', 'much', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'vs.', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'am', 'not', 'very', 'tech', 'minded', 'husband', 'stuff', 'up', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'way', 'wire', 'PSP3', 'TV', 'Closed', 'Captioning', 'works.But', 'anyway', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'got', 'set', 'enjoyed', 'episode', ""n't"", 'happen', 'often']",N/A
1362120,A2BPDFR58H9575,B003TJM5TS,Galina,"[2, 2]","The drama/mystery/thriller ""Criminal Minds"" is truly an amazing show. I started only watching it couple of months ago, and I can't believe that it took me so long to discover it. This is the show where each episode reminds me of my favorite book on the subject of finding the serial killers by trying to get inside their minds and to think the way they do, and equally terrific adaptation, Red Dragon by Thomas Harris/Manhunter by Michael Mann. Again and again the team of the brilliant profilers, fly from their headquarters in Quantico, VA to different locations all over the country to put their minds together and complete the profile of the mysterious unsub (unknown subject) and to prevent the next strike which would be deadly. This is a very difficult, demanding and exhausting job where the lives of innocent people are at stake and every minute, even second matters. This job takes its toll from every member of the team. Often they have to make very difficult choices and more than once they face the deadly danger not only to themselves but to those who are the closest to them.Since I started watching the show, I am trying to catch up the seasons that I missed, so I watch the re-runs every time I have a chance getting the ""crash course"" of Criminal Minds. What amazes me that watching so many episodes in such short period of time only makes me wanting to see more. I don't recall a single mediocre episode. All of them share the intelligent writing, compelling story, inspired acting from the regular members of the cast (an elite team of FBI profilers - BAU analysts) and the guest stars. I like the music score and the choice of songs is very fitting for each occasion. I also like the famous quotes which one of the team members tells in the end of each episode, which sums up the story perfectly. More than once, I was moved deeply by the way the story was going and its resolution. What keeps me entrancing to the screen during each episode is the brain storm, the collective mind of the team putting the evidence, the small details together, analyzing them, searching for the right question to ask their super computer analyst Penelope Garcia; so she would perform her magic and come up with the one name - of the unsub who must be stopped before he attacks deadly again.I also noticed how masterfully the creators make the references not only to the real life famous cases but to the earlier films and books. I recognized the references to Tom Harris's Dr. Hannibal's books and films, to ""Perfume: The Story of a Murderer"", to ""Natural Born Killers"". One of the episodes paid homage to both ""Psycho"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"". Often, the writers find the subjects for the episodes from the latest news. But no matter where they find the topics for the show, each episode comes out as gripping and absorbing from the first moment to the very end. To put it shortly - the must for the fans of the genre.",5,Criminally entertaining,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,2922,"['drama/mystery/thriller', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'truly', 'amazing', 'show', 'started', 'only', 'watching', 'couple', 'months', 'ago', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'discover', 'show', 'where', 'episode', 'favorite', 'book', 'subject', 'finding', 'serial', 'killers', 'trying', 'get', 'minds', 'think', 'way', 'do', 'equally', 'terrific', 'adaptation', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'Thomas', 'Harris/Manhunter', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Again', 'again', 'team', 'brilliant', 'profilers', 'fly', 'headquarters', 'Quantico', 'VA', 'different', 'locations', 'country', 'put', 'minds', 'together', 'complete', 'profile', 'mysterious', 'unsub', 'unknown', 'subject', 'prevent', 'next', 'strike', 'would', 'be', 'deadly', 'very', 'difficult', 'demanding', 'exhausting', 'job', 'where', 'lives', 'innocent', 'people', 'are', 'stake', 'minute', 'even', 'second', 'matters', 'job', 'toll', 'member', 'team', 'have', 'make', 'very', 'difficult', 'choices', 'more', 'once', 'face', 'deadly', 'danger', 'not', 'only', 'who', 'are', 'closest', 'them.Since', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'am', 'trying', 'catch', 'up', 'seasons', 'missed', 'watch', 're-runs', 'time', 'have', 'chance', 'getting', 'crash', 'course', 'Criminal', 'Minds', 'What', 'watching', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'such', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'only', 'wanting', 'see', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'single', 'mediocre', 'episode', 'share', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'compelling', 'story', 'inspired', 'acting', 'regular', 'members', 'cast', 'elite', 'team', 'FBI', 'profilers', 'BAU', 'analysts', 'guest', 'music', 'score', 'choice', 'songs', 'very', 'fitting', 'occasion', 'also', 'famous', 'quotes', 'one', 'team', 'members', 'tells', 'end', 'episode', 'up', 'story', 'perfectly', 'More', 'once', 'was', 'moved', 'deeply', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'going', 'resolution', 'What', 'entrancing', 'screen', 'episode', 'brain', 'storm', 'collective', 'mind', 'team', 'putting', 'evidence', 'small', 'details', 'together', 'analyzing', 'searching', 'right', 'question', 'ask', 'super', 'computer', 'analyst', 'Penelope', 'Garcia', 'would', 'perform', 'magic', 'come', 'up', 'one', 'name', 'unsub', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'stopped', 'deadly', 'again.I', 'also', 'noticed', 'how', 'masterfully', 'creators', 'make', 'references', 'not', 'only', 'real', 'life', 'famous', 'cases', 'earlier', 'films', 'books', 'recognized', 'references', 'Tom', 'Harris', 'Dr.', 'Hannibal', 'books', 'films', 'Perfume', 'Story', 'Murderer', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Killers', 'One', 'episodes', 'paid', 'homage', 'Psycho', 'Sunset', 'Boulevard', 'Often', 'writers', 'find', 'subjects', 'episodes', 'latest', 'news', 'matter', 'where', 'find', 'topics', 'show', 'episode', 'out', 'gripping', 'absorbing', 'first', 'moment', 'very', 'end', 'put', 'shortly', 'must', 'fans', 'genre']",N/A
