1379717,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0040ZN9MM,Andy Orrock,"[3, 3]","Kudos to NBA Entertainment for such a great idea for a film and for pulling it off so brilliantly.  The emotional wallop of 'Once Brothers' surprised me.  I knew of the great tragedy of Drazen Petrovic's early, shocking death right as he was on the cusp of NBA super-stardom.  I also knew of the great Yugoslavian teams of the late Eighties culminating in 1990's World Championship.  I also knew that the Balkan conflicts ripped the team apart.What I did not know - and what this film focuses on - is how deeply that conflict forever ruptured these teammates.  Once brothers, these players - a team comprised of individuals from Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and Bosnia - became divided along state and ethic lines.  The dual axis of the team revolved around the stars: Croatian Petrovic and Serbian Divac.  A single flashpoint incident - Divac ripping a Croatian flag out of a celebrant's hands after the championship - became the tinder for the split between the two men.  Divac swears to this day that his actions were misinterpreted: that he did it because it was a Yugoslavian triumph, not a time for state partisanship.  No matter, the action was taken by Petrovic (and many others) in a far different light.Divac's regret - that Petrovic died before the two of them could reconcile - is palpable.  It's his narration - he's the film's guide in the US, Serbia...and, most stirringly, in Croatia - that guides us throughout.  Think you don't care one way or another about Vlade Divac?  Think again.  You'll have a completely different opinion after seeing this film.  His likable personality and genuine regret and remorse are what make this excellent film work.  And the last scene?  I defy you not to be impacted by it.",5,The emotional wallop of 'Once Brothers' will take you by surprise,1310169600,"07 9, 2011",2011,1722,"['Kudos', 'NBA', 'Entertainment', 'such', 'great', 'idea', 'film', 'pulling', 'off', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'emotional', 'wallop', ""'Once"", 'Brothers', 'surprised', 'knew', 'great', 'tragedy', 'Drazen', 'Petrovic', 'early', 'shocking', 'death', 'right', 'was', 'cusp', 'NBA', 'super-stardom', 'also', 'knew', 'great', 'Yugoslavian', 'teams', 'late', 'Eighties', 'culminating', '1990', 'World', 'Championship', 'also', 'knew', 'Balkan', 'conflicts', 'ripped', 'team', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'film', 'how', 'deeply', 'conflict', 'forever', 'ruptured', 'teammates', 'Once', 'brothers', 'players', 'team', 'comprised', 'individuals', 'Croatia', 'Serbia', 'Slovenia', 'Bosnia', 'became', 'divided', 'state', 'ethic', 'lines', 'dual', 'axis', 'team', 'revolved', 'stars', 'Croatian', 'Petrovic', 'Serbian', 'Divac', 'A', 'single', 'flashpoint', 'incident', 'Divac', 'ripping', 'Croatian', 'flag', 'celebrant', 'hands', 'championship', 'became', 'tinder', 'split', 'two', 'men', 'Divac', 'day', 'actions', 'were', 'misinterpreted', 'did', 'was', 'Yugoslavian', 'triumph', 'not', 'time', 'state', 'partisanship', 'matter', 'action', 'was', 'taken', 'Petrovic', 'many', 'others', 'far', 'different', 'light.Divac', 'regret', 'Petrovic', 'died', 'two', 'could', 'reconcile', 'palpable', 'narration', 'film', 'guide', 'US', 'Serbia', 'most', 'stirringly', 'Croatia', 'Think', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'one', 'way', 'Vlade', 'Divac', 'Think', 'again', ""'ll"", 'have', 'completely', 'different', 'opinion', 'seeing', 'film', 'likable', 'personality', 'genuine', 'regret', 'remorse', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'excellent', 'film', 'work', 'last', 'scene', 'defy', 'not', 'be', 'impacted']",ESPN Films 30 for 30: Once Brothers

They grew up together playing for Yugoslavia, when the country was unified under one central government, then both opted for the NBA draft in the U.S. When communism fell, and the (6) republics decided to become independent, civil war broke out, dividing the country. This political and bloody confrontation/partition lasted almost the entire decade, and the once-proud Yugoslav national basketball team was broken up, divided and never able to overcome what their country had created. This true story is sad, but redeeming and is probably the best documentary I've seen from ESPN's 30-for-30 series of films.

Like the other great ""sports"" movies, that just use the sport itself as a vehicle to deliver the story.  These two guys could have been brought together by....oh....their love of root beer.  It is a well delivered documentary, that tells the story of love and passion broken by politics and horrible violent war and hate.  Beautiful.......... and......... oh  bring tissues.  One thing that most impressed me was the warmth and gentleness displayed by Magic Johnson.  I am NOT a basketball fan nor a Magic Johnson fan.  In fact until Magic was found to be HIV positive i never knew anything about him but his name.  WOW what a great guy and how he received and helped his new team mate from half way around the world.  That is how you can tell Magic was a real talent.  He did not have to feel threatened, but rather, did everything in his power to make his new team mate feel welcome and successful in a new country.

I didn't know much about this topic other than that Vlade Divac was a very good center who played for the Lakers and Sacremento and that Petrovic died young. The breaking of the friendship between Divac and Petrovic due to a single incident amidst the political upheavals in Yugoslavia, Serbia and Croatia at the time, is show here as a palpable and sudden event where Divac's passions ruled and he was not forgiven for a stupid, rash and unthinking act. The things that struck me - Divac's engaging personality, the warmth of Petrovic's family and friends Kukic and Radja, the winter background of Serbia, Croatia, how Divac was shunned when he returned to visit Zagreb, and the raw talent of the Yugoslav national team of the early 90's. I wish more of the personnages had been identified earlier and more consistently. It wasn't clear who was who at first.
