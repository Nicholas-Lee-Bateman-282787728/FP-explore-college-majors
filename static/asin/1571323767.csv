She is not the type to sit still and watch anything, except the active Wiggles, but this tape she claps and kicks her legs to in delight. She is 13 months old. She loves all the songs. There is not one bad song in this video. I have seen several other Barney videos and none of them compare. This one is full of non-stop singing and dancing. Also the production is supurb compared to all the others. It is movie quality and the children in it don't look like they are acting, like in all the other Barney videos. They look like they are truly enjoying the 10th Anniversary sing along. It is full of bright colors and activities that follow the songs. Like &quot;Grampa's Farm&quot; is sung at a real farm. And &quot;Green Grass Grows Around&quot; is sung while camping at a real campground! Plus there is storybook land with candy, castles and magic.
