254652,A3TKGM2JJJC1I3,6301522931,"Jennifer B. Barton ""Beth Barton""","[4, 5]","The dialogue in this brilliant.  There is a lot of punnish humor but also a lot of anachronistic dialogue that is just situationally hilarious.Paul LeMat stars as the leader of the Born Losers, a biker gang of good guys with three missions in life: Find the evil, Destroy the evil, and find a really great lite beer.  He has visions because of a steel plate in his head and he is being studied (sort of) by one of his fellow bikers who is from MIT.The bad guys are a biker gang of women who wear what appear to be leather jackets with the letters WOW written on the back (later we find out that the jackets reverse to be bowling league jackets). WOW stand for Women of the Wolf.  They are kidnapping babies for fun and profit, says one of the girls but the truth goes much deeper.  The leader of the WOW, played by Eileen Davidson, was abandoned by her parents afer a shoot out with the law and was subsequently raised by wolves.  So now she has plans to create a new generation of fearless independent women by kidnapping baby girls and taking them to the woods to be raised by wolves.It is up to the Born Losers to take on this bevy of beautiful biker babes and put an end to the kidnapping.  Davidson will have to choose between the attraction she feels for LeMat and the culmination of her feminist ideals.Absolutely fantastic but probably is not appropriate for kids.",5,Somewhere between Airplane and Oh Brother Where Art Thou,1063152000,"09 10, 2003",2003,1372,"['dialogue', 'brilliant', 'lot', 'punnish', 'humor', 'also', 'lot', 'anachronistic', 'dialogue', 'just', 'situationally', 'hilarious.Paul', 'LeMat', 'stars', 'leader', 'Born', 'Losers', 'biker', 'gang', 'good', 'guys', 'three', 'missions', 'life', 'evil', 'Destroy', 'evil', 'find', 'really', 'great', 'lite', 'beer', 'visions', 'steel', 'plate', 'head', 'being', 'studied', 'sort', 'one', 'fellow', 'bikers', 'who', 'MIT.The', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'biker', 'gang', 'women', 'who', 'wear', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'leather', 'jackets', 'letters', 'WOW', 'written', 'back', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'jackets', 'reverse', 'be', 'bowling', 'league', 'jackets', 'WOW', 'stand', 'Women', 'Wolf', 'are', 'kidnapping', 'babies', 'fun', 'profit', 'one', 'girls', 'truth', 'much', 'deeper', 'leader', 'WOW', 'played', 'Eileen', 'Davidson', 'was', 'abandoned', 'parents', 'afer', 'shoot', 'law', 'was', 'subsequently', 'raised', 'wolves', 'So', 'now', 'plans', 'create', 'new', 'generation', 'fearless', 'independent', 'women', 'kidnapping', 'baby', 'girls', 'taking', 'woods', 'be', 'raised', 'wolves.It', 'Born', 'Losers', 'take', 'bevy', 'beautiful', 'biker', 'babes', 'put', 'end', 'kidnapping', 'Davidson', 'will', 'have', 'choose', 'attraction', 'LeMat', 'culmination', 'feminist', 'ideals.Absolutely', 'fantastic', 'probably', 'not', 'appropriate', 'kids']",N/A

254654,AW3I97UR8NP7T,6301522931,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[2, 5]","I CONFESS. THE TITLE OF THIS REVIEW IS INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING. IT REFERS TO THE SAM RAIMI/BRUCE CAMPBELL CONNECTION TO THE FILM AND NOT ANY POSSIBLE ZOMBIEFIED BIKERS. SORRY. WE WILL NOW RESUME OUR NORMALLY SCHEDULED REVIEW.""His name was Bruce, and only the day before he and his men the Bourne Losers had been riding that desolate ribbon of highway through the Arizona desert searching vainly for the answers to existential questions about Life, Death, and Draft Beer. That was when Bruce first felt a rift in the delicate fabric of the Universe and he found himself staring into the dark heart of Destiny.""Wow. Not your typical biker movie, huh?That florid prose serves as our first introduction to our hero, we've already met our narrator, a reporter from the Des Moines Daily who is on assignment covering a series of baby nappings that has been taking place throughout the Midwest. We've also briefly met the members of a gang of female bikers known as  Women of the Wolf (WOW for short) and their leader She Wolf as they forced the reporter (played by Barry Livingston) off the road. We suspect that they may not be nice.The Losers help the nameless reporter (played by Barry Livingston) out of his overturned car and he joins up with them for the night. While making popcorn around their campfire later that night, the Professor tells the reporter about Bruce's strange past. It seems that while in Viet Nam Bruce (played by Paul LeMat) had been hit by a mortar shell which special guest star George Plimpton had been unable to remove completely due to its proximity to the nerve cluster in his brain--something writer Ivan Raimi would know about due to his time spent as an emergency room physician in Youngstown, Ohio.Well,it seems that following that incident Bruce developed odd psychic abilities that were studied at MIT, which is where the Professor( played by Jon Menick) first met him. After that Bruce decided to leave on a Great Quest and everyone who believed in him ( his friends from Nam, the Prof etc) got up and followed him. The Quest? To Seek out Evil, Destroy the Evil, and find a really great lite beer.While all of this exposition is going on the WOW are sneaking up on an isolated farm house in the middle of the night...on their bikes...with the motors racing. They tippy toe into the house and grab two babies, despite the best effort of the parents, and (for good measure)they blow up the farm house with what look like home made beer can bombs on pull string detonators. I told you they didn't seems nice. She Wolf it seems leaves little girl babies in the forest to be raised by the wolves,and sells the little boys on the black market.Bruce meanwhile has picked up the scent of all this evil and the Losers, with the reporter in tow, are on their way deeper into heart of Iowa.Soon enough the two gangs meet. Bruce doesn't recognize the evil in She Wolf (Eileen Davidson) when he first encounters her at a gas station.  They exchange steamy double entendres and then go their separate ways.I'm not going to tell you what happens next! You'll have to find a copy  of this obscure little gem and see that for yourself. But rest assured that the Bourne Losers are the most likable biker gang you'll ever encounter and you're gonna miss them when they ride off into the sunset. Yes, there's a lot to enjoy in this unassuming little comedy that is more than it seems to be. There is even a playful swipe at Eileen Davidson's career as a soap opera star if you look, or should I say listen closely?  And there are plot twists and revelations aplenty before we get to the ultimate showdown between Good and Evil in this hilarious comedy that reminds me of very early Coen Brothers, and why shouldn't it? After all the Raimis and the Coens worked together long before any of them were anybody!Please hunt it down and give it a try. You will be so happy that you did!EASY WHEELSDirected by David O'MalleyWritten by Ivan Raimi, Celia Abrams*, and David O;MalleyExecutive Producers: Rob Tapert and Bruce CampbellStarring: Payl Le Mat, Barry Livingston, Eileen Davidson, Theresa Randle, Jami Richards, Marjorie Bransfield, Karen Russell, Jon Menick, Carlos Compean, Joe Shea, and Ted Raimi*Celia Abrams  may be a pen name for Sam Raimi.

254655,A3CJI5SSWKCKGR,6301522931,"Mike from Canada ""Mike""","[0, 0]","Forget 5 stars, I would give this movie 25 stars if I could. It falls very comfortably into the multiple viewing category for me and I think you as well should you have an appetite for an outside the box experience . As stated elsewhere this biker film is all about good versus evil. Eileen Davidson is the wolf worshipping leader of a gang of smoking hot Leather clad biker chicks that barter( after kidnapping them of course)infants for cash. Paul Lemat is her vision obsessed counterpart & leader of a motley, scruffy well meaning collection of wanabe male bikers called The Born Losers.This might be my favorite film of all time. How so, you might ask? Well to start with, let's go to the checklist, first it's funny, second it's sexy & it's emotional in a way a lot of features can't be. You laugh when the characters laugh yet feel the real angst both leaders Paul & Eileen emote as suddenly you're in the middle of a love story and yet it fits so perfectly with all the crazy antics and shenanigans that ensue. I suppose the niche audience for Easy Wheels would have been people in their late teens or twenties back in the late 80's when this was produced. The movie ages well though & I think today if it were relased it would attract a large viewership because as we all know funny & sexy never go out of style. There are so many things about this movie that stand out. Each character in this undertaking is so expertly defined as well as delivered by the cast themselves that by the end of the movie I wanted to, No make that had to find out more about so many lesser known  talents that made this movie such an entertaining package.Simply put,if you're adult age or thereabouts & can appreciate the humour of a flick where everyone is fair game then the laughfest is about to begin. Each time viewed there's always a remark or line I find I missed that enhances the experience. It's a shame ( I agree) this isn't on DVD because Easy Wheels is that good. Maybe someday it will find its way onto TCM Underground ( wouldn't that be great)and another generation can experience this comedy classic!",5,A Movie Masterpiece!,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",2012,2104,"['Forget', '5', 'stars', 'would', 'give', 'movie', '25', 'stars', 'could', 'very', 'comfortably', 'multiple', 'viewing', 'category', 'think', 'well', 'should', 'have', 'appetite', 'outside', 'box', 'experience', 'stated', 'elsewhere', 'biker', 'film', 'about', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'Eileen', 'Davidson', 'wolf', 'worshipping', 'leader', 'gang', 'smoking', 'hot', 'Leather', 'clad', 'biker', 'barter', 'kidnapping', 'course', 'infants', 'cash', 'Paul', 'Lemat', 'vision', 'obsessed', 'counterpart', 'leader', 'motley', 'scruffy', 'well', 'meaning', 'collection', 'wanabe', 'male', 'bikers', 'called', 'Born', 'Losers.This', 'might', 'be', 'favorite', 'film', 'time', 'How', 'so', 'might', 'ask', 'Well', 'start', 'let', 'go', 'checklist', 'first', 'funny', 'second', 'sexy', 'emotional', 'way', 'lot', 'features', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'when', 'characters', 'laugh', 'yet', 'feel', 'real', 'angst', 'leaders', 'Paul', 'Eileen', 'emote', 'suddenly', ""'re"", 'middle', 'love', 'story', 'yet', 'so', 'perfectly', 'crazy', 'antics', 'shenanigans', 'ensue', 'suppose', 'niche', 'audience', 'Easy', 'Wheels', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'people', 'late', 'teens', 'twenties', 'back', 'late', '80', 'when', 'was', 'produced', 'movie', 'well', 'think', 'today', 'were', 'relased', 'would', 'attract', 'large', 'viewership', 'know', 'funny', 'sexy', 'never', 'go', 'style', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'movie', 'stand', 'out', 'character', 'undertaking', 'so', 'expertly', 'defined', 'as', 'well', 'delivered', 'cast', 'end', 'movie', 'wanted', 'No', 'make', 'had', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'so', 'many', 'lesser', 'known', 'talents', 'made', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'package.Simply', 'put', ""'re"", 'adult', 'age', 'thereabouts', 'can', 'appreciate', 'humour', 'flick', 'where', 'everyone', 'fair', 'game', 'then', 'laughfest', 'begin', 'time', 'viewed', 'always', 'remark', 'line', 'find', 'missed', 'experience', 'shame', 'agree', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'Easy', 'Wheels', 'good', 'Maybe', 'someday', 'will', 'find', 'way', 'TCM', 'Underground', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'generation', 'can', 'experience', 'comedy', 'classic']",N/A
