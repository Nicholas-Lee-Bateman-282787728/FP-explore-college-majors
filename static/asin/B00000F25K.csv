I had some tears watching it as a dog lover.  Amazing story, scenery, and very close to real events in 1958.  Now I purchased a dvd-recorder and I converted to dvd, because is out of print.  So far in japan is available in dvd.  I hope after the release of 8below, studios make available ""Antarctica"" again in DVD with extras.

In fact, I watched it with my dog, and she was transfixed by the dog sequences.  It is completely ridiculous that the studio hasn't put it out on DVD yet, as, from what I hear, it's the 2nd highest grossing movie in Japanese history, and I can see why.  The dialogue is a bit wooden, but, hey! it's a Japanese movie, and we've all seen the old Godzillas and they're not any better.  One good thing is that it's mostly narrated in english, so no subtitles.  The soundtrack is a total plus, coming from Vangelis, the master of the keyboards.  If you don't have a smile on your face at the end of this, you're a robot.  The good thing about this particular video is that IF you don't like it, you're basically assured of your money back in re-sale value.  Where can you go wrong?  You like the movie?  It's a masterpiece in YOUR library!  You DON'T like the movie?  Sell it and make your money back and maybe more.

496742,A3J7QJP2L47GDR,B00000F25K,Shilohbloo,"[12, 13]","Well, I finally saw it and what can I say? Five stars for those gorgeous animals and the telling of these poor canines tragic tale, in hopes that we can learn from it, to never allow such a thing to happen again.  Also kudos for the caption in the end mentioning quite boldly that all the dogs were handled with the utmost of care, and that anything that showed harm to the animals was simulated.  Needless to say, the film was as gorgeous as they say... and much more heartbreaking than I had originally anticipated, even for an avid animal lover as myself who has seen way too much. My heart goes out to those poor, precious K-9 heroes left to die, all because equipment is considered more important than loving, loyal, four-legged souls. A concept I will never understand, especially since those animals are the very ones that saved the lives of the explorers. Where's the gratitude?!!! And One might say, ""Well, that was 1957, things have changed since then""... but what of the later heroic Vietnam War dogs left to die... the more recent K-9 Katrina victims... and the never-ending stories of the no longer interested families leaving their pups to fend for themselves, just to name a very minor few?!!! The love the explorers showed for their dogs was very touching, but even there, I felt that they should have stayed with the dogs until they were sure another team would show, especially since the weather was so bad and things were being handled so much more differently than usual... but having failed doing that, they should have, at the very least, attempted to return with immediate, continued and absolute persistence!  Once home, they simply stopped trying.  If it were their children that were stranded, you know they would have found a way; they would have done whatever it took.  You never leave a man -- or dog -- behind (especially when you brought them there and they saved your life!). With that, I do suggest that everyone view this movie so to let the haunting images fill you, and then never allow such a horrific thing to happen again. These dogs story needs to be told, so that their deaths are never, ever in vain and such tragedy is never allowed to ever happen again.  **In Beloved Memory of the Magnificent 15:  Anko (3 years old), Jack (4 years old), Riki (Lead dog - 6 years old), Shiro (6 years old), Kuma (5 years old), Deri (6 years old), which were the six dogs that went missing; Goro (Wheel dog - 6 years old), Besu, Moku, Aka, Kuro, Bochi, Kuma, which were the seven dogs that died chained, immobile, and starving; and Taro and Jiro, which were the two survivors of whom statues and legends were made.",5,The Original Beloved and Betrayed,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,2641,"['Well', 'finally', 'saw', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'Five', 'stars', 'gorgeous', 'animals', 'telling', 'poor', 'canines', 'tragic', 'tale', 'hopes', 'can', 'learn', 'never', 'allow', 'such', 'thing', 'happen', 'again', 'Also', 'caption', 'end', 'mentioning', 'quite', 'boldly', 'dogs', 'were', 'handled', 'utmost', 'care', 'anything', 'showed', 'harm', 'animals', 'was', 'simulated', 'Needless', 'say', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'heartbreaking', 'had', 'originally', 'anticipated', 'even', 'avid', 'animal', 'lover', 'myself', 'who', 'seen', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'heart', 'out', 'poor', 'precious', 'K-9', 'heroes', 'left', 'die', 'equipment', 'considered', 'more', 'important', 'loving', 'loyal', 'four-legged', 'souls', 'concept', 'will', 'never', 'understand', 'especially', 'animals', 'are', 'very', 'ones', 'saved', 'lives', 'explorers', 'Where', 'gratitude', 'One', 'might', 'say', 'Well', 'was', '1957', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'then', 'what', 'later', 'heroic', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'dogs', 'left', 'die', 'more', 'recent', 'K-9', 'Katrina', 'victims', 'never-ending', 'stories', 'longer', 'interested', 'families', 'leaving', 'pups', 'fend', 'just', 'name', 'very', 'minor', 'few', 'love', 'explorers', 'showed', 'dogs', 'was', 'very', 'touching', 'even', 'there', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'stayed', 'dogs', 'were', 'sure', 'team', 'would', 'show', 'especially', 'weather', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'things', 'were', 'being', 'handled', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'differently', 'usual', 'having', 'failed', 'doing', 'should', 'have', 'very', 'least', 'attempted', 'return', 'immediate', 'continued', 'absolute', 'persistence', 'Once', 'home', 'simply', 'stopped', 'trying', 'were', 'children', 'were', 'stranded', 'know', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'took', 'never', 'leave', 'man', 'dog', 'especially', 'when', 'brought', 'saved', 'life', 'do', 'suggest', 'everyone', 'view', 'movie', 'so', 'let', 'haunting', 'images', 'fill', 'then', 'never', 'allow', 'such', 'horrific', 'thing', 'happen', 'again', 'dogs', 'story', 'needs', 'be', 'told', 'deaths', 'are', 'never', 'ever', 'vain', 'such', 'tragedy', 'never', 'allowed', 'ever', 'happen', 'again', '**In', 'Beloved', 'Memory', 'Magnificent', '15', 'Anko', '3', 'years', 'old', 'Jack', '4', 'years', 'old', 'Riki', 'Lead', '6', 'years', 'old', 'Shiro', '6', 'years', 'old', 'Kuma', '5', 'years', 'old', 'Deri', '6', 'years', 'old', 'were', 'six', 'dogs', 'went', 'missing', 'Goro', 'Wheel', '6', 'years', 'old', 'Besu', 'Moku', 'Aka', 'Kuro', 'Bochi', 'Kuma', 'were', 'seven', 'dogs', 'died', 'chained', 'immobile', 'starving', 'Taro', 'Jiro', 'were', 'two', 'survivors', 'whom', 'statues', 'legends', 'were', 'made']",Antarctica VHS
