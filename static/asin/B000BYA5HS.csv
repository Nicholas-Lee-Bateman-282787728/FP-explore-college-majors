952971,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000BYA5HS,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[17, 19]","Tamara was a good entertaining horror/teenage angst movie in the same vein as De Palma's Carrie and pretty much most of the teenage revenge/slasher flicks of the late 70's and early 80's. Such horror films involved the high school jocks and popular cliques getting their comeuppance by way of the nerdy student who has had enough. This time around the nerd in question is one Tamara whose shy, bookish and frumpy nature makes her an easy mark for every other kid in school.Newcomer and extremely hot Jenna Dewan plays the title role and she does a very good job pulling off the dual personality role Tamara goes through the film. The first half of the film Dewan was very believable as the mousy and nerdy student whose low self-esteem adds to keeping her ostracized from the rest of the student population. It doesn't help that she begins to misread one of her teacher's (played by Matthew Marsden) attempts to help her as some sort of seduction she so craves. There is a small bit of a bright side to her daily existence in the form Chloe (played by Katie Stuart), she of the popular girl with a heart-of-gold role. Tamara's life soon turns for the worst as her attempts to show her love for her helpful teacher is rebuffed and her published article about drug-use in athletics puts her in the crosshairs of a couple of jocks with much to lose.Typical of such teenage revenge horror movies, the cruel jocks and popular kids concoct a plan to humiliate and embarrass Tamara, but just like those past films their plans backfire and the target of their pans gets killed during the the prank. The filmmaker really don't add something new to this tried and tested formula. Instead of calling for the authorities to report the accidental death of their schoolmate, the kids decide, through the bullying of the alpha-male in the group, to bury Tamra instead and forget anything ever happened. This plan probably would've worked if Tamara wasn't dabbling in witchcraft as ostracized teenagers are wont to do. Tamara's spell prior to the prank to spellbound her teacher backfires as its activated by the spilling of her blood and to the surprise of the students who did her harm she returns alive, healthy and completely different the start of the new school week.To say that Tamara returns utterly different in more ways than one is an understatement. Ms. Dewan does a vampy, sometimes campy, job portraying the new and improved Tamara. Dewan goes from nerdy, plain-jane Tamara to ultra-sexy, barely there skirt wearing teen seductress whose touch does more than seduce those she has targeted for revenge. Jenna Dewan as the reborn Tamara steams up the screen with her overt sexuality and he practically saves the film from just being an ok, by-the-numbers horror movie. Tamara is Ms. Dewan's film from beginning to end and she does a very good job of keeping the story interesting even if it meant just being on the screen.This film doesn't break new ground in the realm of teen horror. In fact, it's a mish-mash of alot of past teen horror flicks of the past that one could see the many influences in its story. Tamara is part Carrie, Black Christmas, The Craft and a slew of other teenage horror movies. The direction is adequate at best and that's really all one could hope for in a genre film like Tamara. What makes this film entertaining and worth watching is the joy of discovering the new talent in Jenna Dewan. Tamara might not be a great horror film, but Ms. Dewan sure more than tries to make it more than it's B-movie pedigree.",4,Jenna Dewan's dual role as Tamara is reason enough to watch,1154822400,"08 6, 2006",2006,3534,"['Tamara', 'was', 'good', 'entertaining', 'horror/teenage', 'angst', 'movie', 'same', 'vein', 'De', 'Palma', 'Carrie', 'pretty', 'much', 'most', 'teenage', 'revenge/slasher', 'flicks', 'late', '70', 'early', '80', 'Such', 'horror', 'films', 'involved', 'high', 'school', 'jocks', 'popular', 'cliques', 'getting', 'comeuppance', 'way', 'nerdy', 'student', 'who', 'had', 'enough', 'time', 'nerd', 'question', 'one', 'Tamara', 'shy', 'bookish', 'frumpy', 'nature', 'easy', 'mark', 'other', 'kid', 'school.Newcomer', 'extremely', 'hot', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'title', 'role', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'pulling', 'off', 'dual', 'personality', 'role', 'Tamara', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Dewan', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'mousy', 'nerdy', 'student', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'keeping', 'ostracized', 'rest', 'student', 'population', ""n't"", 'help', 'misread', 'one', 'teacher', 'played', 'Matthew', 'Marsden', 'help', 'sort', 'seduction', 'so', 'small', 'bit', 'bright', 'side', 'daily', 'existence', 'form', 'Chloe', 'played', 'Katie', 'Stuart', 'popular', 'girl', 'heart-of-gold', 'role', 'Tamara', 'life', 'soon', 'worst', 'attempts', 'show', 'love', 'helpful', 'teacher', 'rebuffed', 'published', 'article', 'drug-use', 'athletics', 'puts', 'crosshairs', 'couple', 'jocks', 'much', 'lose.Typical', 'such', 'teenage', 'revenge', 'horror', 'movies', 'cruel', 'jocks', 'popular', 'kids', 'concoct', 'plan', 'humiliate', 'embarrass', 'Tamara', 'just', 'past', 'films', 'plans', 'backfire', 'target', 'pans', 'killed', 'prank', 'filmmaker', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'something', 'new', 'tried', 'tested', 'formula', 'Instead', 'calling', 'authorities', 'report', 'accidental', 'death', 'schoolmate', 'kids', 'decide', 'bullying', 'alpha-male', 'group', 'bury', 'Tamra', 'instead', 'forget', 'anything', 'ever', 'happened', 'plan', 'probably', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'Tamara', 'was', ""n't"", 'dabbling', 'witchcraft', 'ostracized', 'teenagers', 'are', 'wont', 'do', 'Tamara', 'spell', 'prior', 'prank', 'spellbound', 'teacher', 'activated', 'spilling', 'blood', 'surprise', 'students', 'who', 'did', 'harm', 'alive', 'healthy', 'completely', 'different', 'start', 'new', 'school', 'week.To', 'say', 'Tamara', 'utterly', 'different', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'understatement', 'Ms.', 'Dewan', 'vampy', 'sometimes', 'campy', 'job', 'portraying', 'new', 'improved', 'Tamara', 'Dewan', 'nerdy', 'plain-jane', 'Tamara', 'ultra-sexy', 'barely', 'wearing', 'teen', 'seductress', 'touch', 'more', 'seduce', 'targeted', 'revenge', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'reborn', 'Tamara', 'up', 'screen', 'overt', 'sexuality', 'practically', 'film', 'just', 'being', 'ok', 'by-the-numbers', 'horror', 'movie', 'Tamara', 'Ms.', 'Dewan', 'film', 'beginning', 'end', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'keeping', 'story', 'interesting', 'even', 'meant', 'just', 'being', 'screen.This', 'film', ""n't"", 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'realm', 'teen', 'horror', 'fact', 'mish-mash', 'alot', 'past', 'teen', 'horror', 'flicks', 'past', 'one', 'could', 'see', 'many', 'influences', 'story', 'Tamara', 'part', 'Carrie', 'Black', 'Christmas', 'Craft', 'slew', 'other', 'teenage', 'horror', 'movies', 'direction', 'adequate', 'best', 'really', 'one', 'could', 'hope', 'genre', 'film', 'Tamara', 'What', 'film', 'entertaining', 'worth', 'watching', 'joy', 'discovering', 'new', 'talent', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'Tamara', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'Ms.', 'Dewan', 'sure', 'more', 'tries', 'make', 'more', 'B-movie', 'pedigree']",Tamara

952975,AQG5YCXO6FY6K,B000BYA5HS,but_seriously_folks,"[0, 0]","I give an 'A' for effort for two reasons: 1) while the story idea is not entirely original, there were enough intricacies and differences to make for an entertaining movie and 2) the lead actress was terrific. She starts out as an introverted, repressed target for bullies then, by the end of the movie, she is a dominant powerful force of violent fury...and she pulls it off so well!As for the overall execution, the pacing was so-so (thus the 'C'). There were parts of the movie that could've been tightened-up, meaning that the scene already made its point but they kind of dragged it out....almost as if the director didn't think the viewer was smart enough to catch it the first time through, so the characters repeat/reiterate the same thing again.The other facet of average execution was the acting of the supporting cast, especially the two primary male antagonists. I don't know if it is a matter of the rest of the cast being so mediocre or if it was a matter of the lead being so much better, but the disparity between the lead and the supporting cast definitely detracted from an otherwise fun, enjoyable movie.Despite the pacing and some of the acting, this movie is exactly what one wants (OK, at least me) from a horror movie: some good gore (albeit a little light on this front, too), some good scares, and a good way to spend 90 minutes on a cold, gray afternoon in the midwest.",4,"'A' for effort, 'C' Execution",1260144000,"12 7, 2009",2009,1395,"['give', 'A', 'effort', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'story', 'idea', 'not', 'entirely', 'original', 'were', 'enough', 'intricacies', 'differences', 'make', 'entertaining', 'movie', '2', 'lead', 'actress', 'was', 'terrific', 'out', 'introverted', 'repressed', 'target', 'bullies', 'then', 'end', 'movie', 'dominant', 'powerful', 'force', 'violent', 'fury', 'off', 'so', 'well', 'overall', 'execution', 'pacing', 'was', 'so-so', 'thus', 'C', 'were', 'parts', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tightened-up', 'meaning', 'scene', 'already', 'made', 'point', 'kind', 'dragged', 'out', '.almost', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'viewer', 'was', 'smart', 'enough', 'catch', 'first', 'time', 'characters', 'repeat/reiterate', 'same', 'thing', 'other', 'facet', 'average', 'execution', 'was', 'acting', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'two', 'primary', 'male', 'antagonists', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'matter', 'rest', 'cast', 'being', 'so', 'mediocre', 'was', 'matter', 'lead', 'being', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'disparity', 'lead', 'supporting', 'cast', 'definitely', 'detracted', 'otherwise', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'pacing', 'acting', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'one', 'OK', 'least', 'horror', 'movie', 'good', 'gore', 'little', 'light', 'front', 'too', 'good', 'scares', 'good', 'way', 'spend', '90', 'minutes', 'cold', 'gray', 'afternoon', 'midwest']",Tamara
952976,A21VGNU5959O85,B000BYA5HS,CaterpillarGirl,"[2, 2]","I have read other reviews of this movie, and a lot of people are comparing Tamara with 80's Horror Films. I can see the comparisons, the way the movie follows a formula, and although it isn't a blatant rip-off of one certain movie, it most certainly shadows certain scenes and characters throughout.Tamara is a quiet introvert with a talent for writing she is in love with her teacher even though he is older and married and obviously off limits. She wears outdated clothing, her eyebrows are in need of waxing, her hair is mousy and unruly, she hunches over, it's a perfect caricature of the ""nerdy ugly beautiful girl"" waiting for her big break. What is different about her is that we know she is a witch, that she has performed spells on the poor teachers wife so she wont have kids, Yes she is bullied in the shower room a la Carrie style (without the tampons) but I for one didn't feel sorry for her. She wasn't innocent, the bullies thought they would be teaching her a lesson about her feelings for teach and for exposing them for taking steroids, although that was the wrong thing to do, I do believe that Tamara needed to be shown how ridiculous the fantasy of this man leaving his wife really was. Her death was an accident, and they should have gone to the police, although Tamara would have turned into the Vamp regardless, so I understand that plot direction. Why involve the cops, when we are supposed to see how the guilty get what's coming to them through her vengeance.What ensues is her taking them out one by one, using them as her weapons against each other, and against her ultimate enemy, the teacher's wife. The Special Effects were both chilling and disappointing. I loved the ""hear no evil, speak no evil, and see no evil"" kill, but some of the others were muddled by poor CGI and prosthetics, in that aspect it really copied the 80's motif. In the end, we don't like her and we want the survivors to live, as it should be, and the sacrifice of an innocent for the good of the group is beyond copying the 80's it  is true for stories of human nature from all times. I am sure that every male watching thought her demise was a waste, but its also true that her beauty was completely false, enhanced by witchcraft and her hatred, skin deep, and just as fragile.",3,its ALWAYS the quiet ones,1160524800,"10 11, 2006",2006,2284,"['have', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'movie', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'comparing', 'Tamara', '80', 'Horror', 'Films', 'can', 'see', 'comparisons', 'way', 'movie', 'formula', ""n't"", 'blatant', 'rip-off', 'one', 'certain', 'movie', 'most', 'certainly', 'certain', 'scenes', 'characters', 'throughout.Tamara', 'quiet', 'introvert', 'talent', 'writing', 'love', 'teacher', 'even', 'older', 'married', 'obviously', 'limits', 'outdated', 'clothing', 'eyebrows', 'are', 'need', 'waxing', 'hair', 'mousy', 'unruly', 'perfect', 'caricature', 'nerdy', 'ugly', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'waiting', 'big', 'break', 'What', 'different', 'know', 'witch', 'performed', 'spells', 'poor', 'teachers', 'wife', 'have', 'kids', 'Yes', 'bullied', 'shower', 'room', 'la', 'Carrie', 'style', 'tampons', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'sorry', 'was', ""n't"", 'innocent', 'bullies', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'teaching', 'lesson', 'feelings', 'teach', 'exposing', 'taking', 'steroids', 'was', 'wrong', 'thing', 'do', 'do', 'believe', 'Tamara', 'needed', 'be', 'shown', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'fantasy', 'man', 'leaving', 'wife', 'really', 'was', 'death', 'was', 'accident', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'police', 'Tamara', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'Vamp', 'regardless', 'understand', 'plot', 'direction', 'Why', 'involve', 'cops', 'when', 'are', 'supposed', 'see', 'how', 'guilty', 'get', 'what', 'coming', 'vengeance.What', 'taking', 'out', 'one', 'one', 'using', 'weapons', 'other', 'ultimate', 'enemy', 'teacher', 'wife', 'Special', 'Effects', 'were', 'chilling', 'disappointing', 'loved', 'hear', 'evil', 'speak', 'evil', 'see', 'evil', 'kill', 'others', 'were', 'muddled', 'poor', 'CGI', 'prosthetics', 'aspect', 'really', 'copied', '80', 'motif', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'want', 'survivors', 'live', 'should', 'be', 'sacrifice', 'innocent', 'good', 'group', 'copying', '80', 'true', 'stories', 'human', 'nature', 'times', 'am', 'sure', 'male', 'watching', 'thought', 'demise', 'was', 'waste', 'also', 'true', 'beauty', 'was', 'completely', 'false', 'enhanced', 'witchcraft', 'hatred', 'skin', 'deep', 'just', 'fragile']",Tamara

952984,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000BYA5HS,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[2, 4]","As I prepared to watch this movie, I just had a feeling that this was going to be something special, something that would really knock me over somehow - despite the fact it's a direct-to-DVD release from Lions Gate, it didn't sound all that original and would almost certainly be rather predictable, and I had never heard of any of the actors and actresses in the cast.  That feeling I had turned out to be right on the money.  I would just like to thank the director, the casting director, and whoever else was involved in casting Jenna Dewan as Tamara because this young lady is talented, captivating, and absolutely, positively, drop-dead gorgeous.  I thought I had seen sexy women before, but no one can hold a candle to Jenna Dewan.  This is the kind of woman who makes you want to quit your job, take off to Hollywood, and spend the rest of your life just trying to get a glimpse of her in the flesh.  I am totally smitten, as you can tell.  Dewan bears a striking resemblance to Denise Richards - I swear she could be Denise's younger, even more beautiful sister.With its I Know What You Did Last Summer meets Devil in the Flesh meets Jawbreaker meets The Craft kind of storyline, Tamara doesn't really break any new ground - but it does rise above its derivative origins and forge an identity all its own.  Screenwriter Jeffrey Reddick maintains a surprisingly tight plot throughout, leaving few questions unanswered, and he even succeeds in giving us a final scene that isn't silly or campy at all.  When I start describing the plot points, you'll think you've seen all of them before, and you have, but you probably haven't seen them all brought together in such impressive fashion as this.  It all starts with your basic high school outcast.  Tamara is a rather plain girl (and I must say the makeup department deserves some kind of major award for actually making Jenna Dewan look plain) with no friends, an unhappy home life, a crush on her English teacher, Mr. Natolly (Matthew Marsden), and an intense interest in witchcraft.  She is also smart, which ends up getting her in trouble when her article about performance-enhancing drug use among some of the school's athletes is published.  Dumb jocks don't get mad, they get even, and they cook up a particularly vicious prank to play on poor Tamara - dragging the local AV geek and a couple of new students into the plot with them.  As so often happens, things get out of hand and - well, Tamara dies.  The others get rid of the body and swear to never mention the night's events again.Everything would probably have been fine if Tamara hadn't shown up for class a couple of days later.  As if that's not surprising enough, plain old Tamara has suddenly turned into the hottest woman on the face of the earth.  Needless to say, Tamara's not about to forgive and forget.  Now she could just go around killing all of those who wronged her, but that wouldn't be all that fun, would it?  And we certainly don't want any blood getting on any of her new slinky dresses or ruining her makeup.  Since she now has the power to control anyone with just a touch, her revenge is going to be all the sweeter.  Besides, she also needs time to work on stealing Mr. Natolly away from his wife.In case you're wondering - yes, there will be blood.  And gore, too.  The special effects are a little uneven, but they're pretty satisfying overall.  A couple of the earlier scenes look ridiculously fake, but the first of Tamara's victims dies a most satisfying, impressive death,  and all of the later scenes are more than satisfactorily done.  The crew even takes the time to add little unnecessary details, earning them extra kudos in my book.  There's nothing here to make a gorehound flinch, but I would expect a few eeeewwwws from your average viewer.  Technically, I wouldn't even classify Tamara as horror; it's really more of a psychological thriller with strong horror overtones.Obviously, I think Tamara is an excellent film.  It's particularly impressive for a direct-to-DVD release.  It comes from the creator of Final Destination, so it should be no surprise that the plot is much more than a mere excuse for stringing a few death scenes together.  For me, though, this film is all about Jenna Dewan, who simply owns the camera.  This young lady ought to be a superstar - I know I'd gladly pay to watch her do anything at all.",5,One heck of an entertaining thriller -- Jenna Dewan is the hottest young lady on the planet,1154995200,"08 8, 2006",2006,4382,"['prepared', 'watch', 'movie', 'just', 'had', 'feeling', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'something', 'special', 'something', 'would', 'really', 'knock', 'somehow', 'fact', 'direct-to-DVD', 'release', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'original', 'would', 'almost', 'certainly', 'be', 'rather', 'predictable', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'actors', 'actresses', 'cast', 'feeling', 'had', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'right', 'money', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'thank', 'director', 'casting', 'director', 'whoever', 'else', 'was', 'involved', 'casting', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'Tamara', 'young', 'lady', 'talented', 'captivating', 'absolutely', 'positively', 'drop-dead', 'gorgeous', 'thought', 'had', 'seen', 'sexy', 'women', 'one', 'can', 'hold', 'candle', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'kind', 'woman', 'who', 'want', 'quit', 'job', 'take', 'off', 'Hollywood', 'spend', 'rest', 'life', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'glimpse', 'flesh', 'am', 'totally', 'smitten', 'can', 'tell', 'Dewan', 'striking', 'resemblance', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'swear', 'could', 'be', 'Denise', 'younger', 'even', 'more', 'beautiful', 'sister.With', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'meets', 'Devil', 'Flesh', 'meets', 'Jawbreaker', 'Craft', 'kind', 'storyline', 'Tamara', ""n't"", 'really', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'rise', 'derivative', 'origins', 'forge', 'identity', 'own', 'Screenwriter', 'Jeffrey', 'Reddick', 'surprisingly', 'tight', 'plot', 'leaving', 'few', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'even', 'giving', 'final', 'scene', ""n't"", 'silly', 'campy', 'When', 'start', 'describing', 'plot', 'points', ""'ll"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'brought', 'together', 'such', 'impressive', 'fashion', 'basic', 'high', 'school', 'outcast', 'Tamara', 'rather', 'plain', 'girl', 'must', 'say', 'makeup', 'department', 'kind', 'major', 'award', 'actually', 'making', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'look', 'plain', 'friends', 'unhappy', 'home', 'life', 'crush', 'English', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Natolly', 'Matthew', 'Marsden', 'intense', 'interest', 'witchcraft', 'also', 'smart', 'up', 'getting', 'trouble', 'when', 'article', 'performance-enhancing', 'drug', 'use', 'school', 'athletes', 'published', 'Dumb', 'jocks', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'mad', 'get', 'even', 'cook', 'up', 'particularly', 'vicious', 'prank', 'play', 'poor', 'Tamara', 'dragging', 'local', 'AV', 'geek', 'couple', 'new', 'students', 'plot', 'so', 'often', 'things', 'get', 'hand', 'well', 'Tamara', 'others', 'get', 'rid', 'body', 'swear', 'never', 'mention', 'night', 'events', 'again.Everything', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'fine', 'Tamara', 'had', ""n't"", 'shown', 'up', 'class', 'couple', 'days', 'later', 'not', 'surprising', 'enough', 'plain', 'old', 'Tamara', 'suddenly', 'turned', 'hottest', 'woman', 'face', 'earth', 'Needless', 'say', 'Tamara', 'not', 'forgive', 'forget', 'Now', 'could', 'just', 'go', 'around', 'killing', 'who', 'wronged', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'fun', 'would', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'blood', 'getting', 'new', 'slinky', 'dresses', 'ruining', 'makeup', 'now', 'power', 'control', 'anyone', 'just', 'touch', 'revenge', 'going', 'be', 'sweeter', 'also', 'time', 'work', 'stealing', 'Mr.', 'Natolly', 'away', 'wife.In', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'yes', 'will', 'be', 'blood', 'gore', 'too', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'little', 'uneven', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'satisfying', 'overall', 'couple', 'earlier', 'scenes', 'look', 'ridiculously', 'fake', 'first', 'Tamara', 'victims', 'most', 'satisfying', 'impressive', 'death', 'later', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'satisfactorily', 'done', 'crew', 'even', 'time', 'add', 'little', 'unnecessary', 'details', 'earning', 'extra', 'kudos', 'book', 'nothing', 'here', 'make', 'gorehound', 'flinch', 'would', 'expect', 'few', 'eeeewwwws', 'average', 'viewer', 'Technically', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'classify', 'Tamara', 'horror', 'really', 'more', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'strong', 'horror', 'overtones.Obviously', 'think', 'Tamara', 'excellent', 'film', 'particularly', 'impressive', 'direct-to-DVD', 'release', 'creator', 'Final', 'Destination', 'should', 'be', 'surprise', 'plot', 'much', 'more', 'mere', 'excuse', 'stringing', 'few', 'death', 'scenes', 'together', 'though', 'film', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'who', 'simply', 'camera', 'young', 'lady', 'ought', 'be', 'superstar', 'know', ""'d"", 'gladly', 'pay', 'watch', 'do', 'anything']",Tamara

952991,AZ1UFPNARPZD2,B000BYA5HS,"Jeffrey Ellis ""bored recluse""","[41, 43]","Tamara is an occasionally diverting horror film.  The title character (well played by dancer Jenna Dewan) is a shy, nerdy high school student who manages to get on the bad side of the jocks at her school.  Natrually, this leads to the jocks pulling a rather cruel prank on Tarma and, of course, this leads to Tamara accidentally getting killed and buried out in the woods.  However, like all shy, nerdy girls in these types of films, Tamara was into black magic and, the next day, everyone is quite surprised to see Tamara boldly back from the dead, strutting through the school hallways in a high heels and a red bustier.  Not only has returning from the dead given Tamara a new look but it's also left her with a thirst for revenge and the supernatural powers necessary to get it.The film's plot will be obvious to anyone who has ever seen a horror film and neither director Jeremy Haft or writer Jeffrey Reddick offer up any new twists on a familiar story.  However, the film does occasionally feature some memorable moments.  Though most of the actors sleepwalk through their roles, three actresses do offer up performances that transcend the limitations of their parts.  As Tamara's best friend, Katie Stuart is immensely likeable and believable as a well-meaning teenager who has suddenly found herself in over her head.  Claudette Mink, who plays the unfortunate wife of a teacher that Tamara has a crush on, is good in a relatively thankless role and she brings a real sense of fear to the scenes where she's menaced by Tamara's magic.  She makes those scenes real and, for a few minutes at least, helps the picture rise above the limitations of its plot.  As the title character, Jenna Dewan gives a strong and credible performance.  Her strongest moments are in the beginning of the film when she makes Tamara's loneliness very real and poignant.  Her terror and shame when she discovers that she's been the victim of a cruel prank is never less than believable and it helps to make an awkward scene very credible.  Once she returns from the dead as evil Tamara, she is betrayed by a script that requires her to be almost too campy to be truly threatening but Dewan still manages to believably convey the anger and the need for revenge that lies underneath the surface of someone whose spent their entire life being picked on.The direction from Jeremy Haft is rather pedestrian for most of the film until the final fifteen minutes or so.  At this point, the survivors of Tamara's revenge find themselves under seige in a small hospital and it is here that the film actually comes alive.  Haft creates a good deal of tension in these scenes and actually makes the fate of some of Tamara's victims rather tragic.  The closing sequence of this film is almost good enough to excuse the rather lame moments that preceded it and it is in these final scenes that Tamara is the most compelling.In the end, Tamara is a wildly uneven film and probably one that won't be enjoyed by people who aren't fans of horror films.  However, Tamara has just enough promising moments to make it worth taking a chance on.",3,Uneven but occasionally promising,1145664000,"04 22, 2006",2006,3108,"['Tamara', 'occasionally', 'diverting', 'horror', 'film', 'title', 'character', 'well', 'played', 'dancer', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'shy', 'nerdy', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'who', 'get', 'bad', 'side', 'jocks', 'school', 'Natrually', 'jocks', 'pulling', 'rather', 'cruel', 'prank', 'Tarma', 'course', 'Tamara', 'accidentally', 'getting', 'killed', 'buried', 'out', 'woods', 'However', 'shy', 'nerdy', 'girls', 'types', 'films', 'Tamara', 'was', 'black', 'magic', 'next', 'day', 'everyone', 'quite', 'surprised', 'see', 'Tamara', 'boldly', 'back', 'dead', 'strutting', 'school', 'hallways', 'high', 'heels', 'red', 'bustier', 'Not', 'only', 'returning', 'dead', 'given', 'Tamara', 'new', 'look', 'also', 'left', 'thirst', 'revenge', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'necessary', 'get', 'it.The', 'film', 'plot', 'will', 'be', 'obvious', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'seen', 'horror', 'film', 'director', 'Jeremy', 'Haft', 'writer', 'Jeffrey', 'Reddick', 'offer', 'up', 'new', 'twists', 'familiar', 'story', 'However', 'film', 'occasionally', 'feature', 'memorable', 'moments', 'most', 'actors', 'sleepwalk', 'roles', 'three', 'actresses', 'do', 'offer', 'up', 'performances', 'transcend', 'limitations', 'parts', 'Tamara', 'best', 'friend', 'Katie', 'Stuart', 'immensely', 'likeable', 'believable', 'well-meaning', 'teenager', 'who', 'suddenly', 'found', 'head', 'Claudette', 'Mink', 'who', 'unfortunate', 'wife', 'teacher', 'Tamara', 'crush', 'good', 'relatively', 'thankless', 'role', 'real', 'sense', 'fear', 'scenes', 'where', 'menaced', 'Tamara', 'magic', 'scenes', 'real', 'few', 'minutes', 'least', 'picture', 'rise', 'limitations', 'plot', 'title', 'character', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'strong', 'credible', 'performance', 'strongest', 'moments', 'are', 'beginning', 'film', 'when', 'Tamara', 'loneliness', 'very', 'real', 'poignant', 'terror', 'shame', 'when', 'been', 'victim', 'cruel', 'prank', 'never', 'less', 'believable', 'make', 'awkward', 'scene', 'very', 'credible', 'dead', 'evil', 'Tamara', 'betrayed', 'script', 'be', 'almost', 'too', 'campy', 'be', 'truly', 'threatening', 'Dewan', 'still', 'believably', 'convey', 'anger', 'need', 'revenge', 'surface', 'someone', 'spent', 'entire', 'life', 'being', 'picked', 'on.The', 'direction', 'Jeremy', 'Haft', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'most', 'film', 'final', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'so', 'point', 'survivors', 'Tamara', 'revenge', 'find', 'seige', 'small', 'hospital', 'here', 'film', 'actually', 'alive', 'Haft', 'good', 'deal', 'tension', 'scenes', 'actually', 'fate', 'Tamara', 'victims', 'rather', 'tragic', 'closing', 'sequence', 'film', 'almost', 'good', 'enough', 'excuse', 'rather', 'lame', 'moments', 'preceded', 'final', 'scenes', 'Tamara', 'most', 'compelling.In', 'end', 'Tamara', 'wildly', 'uneven', 'film', 'probably', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'enjoyed', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'fans', 'horror', 'films', 'However', 'Tamara', 'just', 'enough', 'promising', 'moments', 'make', 'worth', 'taking', 'chance']",Tamara

It is instantly apparent that this film won't win awards or critical acclaim, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been fun.  There are plenty of cheesy (or gruesome) indie shockers that I have appreciated.  A film of this type can entertain as long as it fully embraces and acknowledges its limitations.  If nothing else--get in my face, shock me, repulse me, make me cringe at bad one-liners--anything to connect me to the material and make me overlook its shortcomings.  That said, ""Tamara"" comes close to being a good time but falls woefully short where it mattered the most.The plot of ""Tamara"" is familiar and serviceable.  Borrowing from dozens of more successful flicks, ""Tamara"" pieces together a tale of witchcraft and revenge.  Tamara is a shy high school misfit.  We know this because she wears oversized clothes and has bad hair, even though she is clearly beautiful.  Barely able to put two words together because of social awkwardness, we are supposed to accept that she is a star pupil (even though she's seen sleeping through class) and a crack investigative journalist who has uncovered a steroid scandal at school.  Well, her classmates are none too happy about this!  Using her infatuation with the English teacher, they lure her into a practical joke with unexpectedly nasty consequences.  Let's just say that Tamara strikes back with the assistance of her supernatural leanings--she has studied witchcraft.Now begins a revenge tale, Tamara seeks justice for what was done to her as well as staking a claim on her true ""love.""  From frumpy to porn star, she now has the looks and abilities necessary to drive others to do her bidding.  Some of her revenge fantasies play out well and are acceptably wicked.  The special effects aren't always that special, but I can overlook that.  What I couldn't accept, however, are that the performances didn't elevate the material.  The Tamara character could have been an incredibly fun, nasty, and humorous creation--but, in actuality, came across very flat.  Whether the script or the performance or both, it just left a big void at the center of ""Tamara.""  This character could have been B-movie nirvana connecting us to ghoulish delights.  But, sorry, it fell short.It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it actually might have been ""bad movie"" great under other circumstances.  Only two stars, and I'm not sure why I gave it the extra one--maybe because it was a better movie in my mind or maybe because of witchcraft.

952996,A1CDZNPO7U4E6N,B000BYA5HS,LadyLestat,"[1, 2]","First of all, the movie is very predictable. The story is classic. Tamara is played by Jenna Dewan, and Tamara is a very shy ugly duckling so to speak, who just so happens to practice Witchcraft. Tamara also has a crush on her teacher who is way older, and also married. Tamara makes a huge mistake and exposes the secret that the school jocks have been using steroids, and as a result mandatory drug testing is implemented. Needless to say, this makes them very angry. They then discover Tamara's secret crush and proceed to pull a very cruel prank on her that results in her death. When Tamara's blood is spilled that unknowingly completes a ritual love binding spell that she was casting before that allowing her to rise like The Pheonix from her own ashes. Instead of doing the right thing they decide to cover it up and bury her in the woods like it never happened. The next day, you can imagine the looks of terror on their faces when Tamara shows back up in class looking drop dead sexy, and looking for a little revenge. Tamara possesses the power to make her enemies do her bidding by a single touch, and that's where the fun starts. Now, I usually hate B-Movies, but this one is definitely worth watching. I bypassed this movie at least 20 times in the video store just based on the cover. I thought, yeah right, another teenage slasher film. The teens get caught in the woods having an orgy by the axe welding murderer...PUHLEEZE! I'm glad to see that I was wrong. Frankly, everything about this film was pleasantly surprising. However, it's not for the squeamish, so if the hate the sight of blood, then you may wanna reconsider watching this. I'm not too familiar with Jenna Dewan's past projects, but she played this role pretty convincingly I would say. Katie Suart plays Chloe, and I was familiar with her past projects from the small rolls like ""Titans"" to her larger rolls on ""General Hospital"". Any way, she plays the noble/always wants to do the right thing teen who's just caught up in the middle of the prank with her boyfriend. I think she did a good job as well.

Bernabo,"[2, 3]","There is a market out there for B-movie horror films and enough money to be made that we are getting slick productions from Lion Gate Films and others that might not be a scary as we would want, but are certainly not the laughable tripe of days gone by.  ""Tamara"" is the story of an ugly ducking who turn out not only to be a swan, but also a witch (and not a good witch).  So basically we are doing yet another variation of ""Carrie,"" except this time the title figure is about as good looking as she is deadly.  If you remember, Sissy Spacek received an Oscar nomination for playing Carrie White.  That is not going to happen here.High school student Tamara Riley (Jenna Dewan) is smart, but does not take care of herself or her appearance.  Her mother ran out on her alcoholic father (Chris Sigurdson) years ago.  Tamara has a crush on her teacher, Bill Natolly (Matthew Marsden), who is married to Alison (Claudette Mink) and who appears to be the one person who praises her work.  But she has written an expose on how the jocks are taking performance-enhancing drugs, and they are out for revenge.  Again, the idea is to find a way to humiliate their target, which they manage to do.  Then Tamara accidentally ends up dead, the group decides hushing this up is better than telling the police, and they bury Tamara in the woods.  Tamara was actually an incompetent witch, but being buried with a page with a spell on it turns out to work better than anything she has tried before.  The ""good"" girl of the group is Chloe (Katie Stuart), with her boyfriend, Jesse (Chad Faust).  Shawn (Bryan Clark) is the main bad boy, with Kisah (Melissa Elias) his girl friend and Patrick (Gil Hacohen) his partner in crime.  But none of them get to suffer as much as they deserve, especially given what happens to Roger (Marc DeVigne), the AV geek.On the plus side, for a low budget movie ($4,750,000 counts as low budget these days), this is a movie that makes you squirm without spending a lot of bucks on special effects.  They get some mileage out of the old adage ""Hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil,"" and a simple idea like completely finishing off a bottle of beer can produce results.  I can tell you right now that I ended up rounding up on this film because it had a couple of moments that do a good job of grossing you out, which really does not happen all that often in horror films, especially when we are down to the B level.  Then we can make the blatant understatement that Jenna Dewan cleans up real good when Tamara returns from the grave.  This leads us directly to the downside of the film.Not all of these kids are evil.  But what they do have in common is that they are all really stupid.  They kill Tamara.  They bury her in the woods.  She comes back looking drop dead gorgeous and instead of immediately needing clean underwear the male idiots in the group look like they are getting turned on.  Even when the first of the guilty group die, alarm bells do not go off for these kids.  They even go so far as to acknowledge that Tamara is up to something, and still they just take a number and wait for their turn to Tamara's ""to do"" list.  Everybody left alive ends up at the hospital for a group variation on the ending of ""Halloween"" and we play out the end game, which does have some turns you might not predict.  The net result is not good, but it is not bad and acceptable B-movie horror schlock for the 21st century.",3,"""Revenge Has A Killer Body"" and a mind to match",1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,3440,"['market', 'there', 'B-movie', 'horror', 'films', 'enough', 'money', 'be', 'made', 'are', 'getting', 'slick', 'productions', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'Films', 'others', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'scary', 'would', 'want', 'are', 'certainly', 'not', 'laughable', 'tripe', 'days', 'gone', 'Tamara', 'story', 'ugly', 'ducking', 'who', 'turn', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'swan', 'also', 'witch', 'not', 'good', 'witch', 'So', 'basically', 'are', 'doing', 'yet', 'variation', 'Carrie', 'time', 'title', 'figure', 'as', 'good', 'looking', 'deadly', 'remember', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'playing', 'Carrie', 'White', 'not', 'going', 'happen', 'here.High', 'school', 'student', 'Tamara', 'Riley', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'smart', 'not', 'take', 'care', 'herself', 'appearance', 'mother', 'ran', 'out', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'Chris', 'Sigurdson', 'years', 'ago', 'Tamara', 'crush', 'teacher', 'Bill', 'Natolly', 'Matthew', 'Marsden', 'who', 'married', 'Alison', 'Claudette', 'Mink', 'who', 'be', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'work', 'written', 'expose', 'how', 'jocks', 'are', 'taking', 'performance-enhancing', 'drugs', 'are', 'out', 'revenge', 'Again', 'idea', 'find', 'way', 'humiliate', 'target', 'manage', 'do', 'Then', 'Tamara', 'accidentally', 'up', 'dead', 'group', 'hushing', 'up', 'better', 'telling', 'police', 'bury', 'Tamara', 'woods', 'Tamara', 'was', 'actually', 'incompetent', 'witch', 'being', 'buried', 'page', 'spell', 'out', 'work', 'better', 'anything', 'tried', 'good', 'girl', 'group', 'Chloe', 'Katie', 'Stuart', 'boyfriend', 'Jesse', 'Chad', 'Faust', 'Shawn', 'Bryan', 'Clark', 'main', 'bad', 'boy', 'Kisah', 'Melissa', 'Elias', 'girl', 'friend', 'Patrick', 'Gil', 'Hacohen', 'partner', 'crime', 'none', 'get', 'suffer', 'as', 'much', 'deserve', 'especially', 'given', 'what', 'Roger', 'Marc', 'DeVigne', 'AV', 'geek.On', 'plus', 'side', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', '4,750,000', 'counts', 'low', 'budget', 'days', 'movie', 'squirm', 'spending', 'lot', 'bucks', 'special', 'effects', 'get', 'mileage', 'old', 'adage', 'Hear', 'evil', 'speak', 'evil', 'see', 'evil', 'simple', 'idea', 'completely', 'finishing', 'off', 'bottle', 'beer', 'can', 'produce', 'results', 'can', 'tell', 'right', 'now', 'ended', 'up', 'rounding', 'up', 'film', 'had', 'couple', 'moments', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'grossing', 'really', 'not', 'happen', 'often', 'horror', 'films', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'down', 'B', 'level', 'Then', 'can', 'make', 'blatant', 'understatement', 'Jenna', 'Dewan', 'up', 'real', 'good', 'when', 'Tamara', 'grave', 'directly', 'downside', 'film.Not', 'kids', 'are', 'evil', 'what', 'do', 'have', 'common', 'are', 'really', 'stupid', 'kill', 'Tamara', 'bury', 'woods', 'back', 'looking', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'instead', 'immediately', 'needing', 'clean', 'male', 'idiots', 'group', 'look', 'are', 'getting', 'turned', 'Even', 'when', 'first', 'guilty', 'group', 'die', 'alarm', 'bells', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'off', 'kids', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'acknowledge', 'Tamara', 'up', 'something', 'still', 'just', 'take', 'number', 'wait', 'turn', 'Tamara', 'do', 'list', 'Everybody', 'left', 'alive', 'up', 'hospital', 'group', 'variation', 'ending', 'Halloween', 'play', 'out', 'end', 'game', 'have', 'turns', 'might', 'not', 'predict', 'net', 'result', 'not', 'good', 'not', 'bad', 'acceptable', 'B-movie', 'horror', 'schlock', '21st', 'century']",Tamara

I agree with other reviews that the ending in the hospital was where I got lost. There were a few events that happened during the last 15 minutes that totally made no sense.The movie takes a unique approach to the old Carrie concept. Some of the scenes were fun to watch and a few of the deaths Tamara brought down on her victims were cool. Although some of those most responsible for her death got off with some pretty weak deaths and the ending was whack, the entertainment was good overall and I think Tamara probably raised the bar for B-movies.

953010,A29EEL0560NVG7,B000BYA5HS,"Steve67 ""Steve500067""","[2, 3]","The story starts off pretty much like any 80's horror film, where a group of dumb highschool kids decide to play a prank on the oucast,only to have it end in death. See our lead is quiet girl who chooses to do her work rather than drink and party, but she gets the attention of a couple jocks when she posts a report of enhance-performing drug-use amongst the team in the school paper. This naturally  leads them to come up with this insane scheme to publicly humiliate her. After discovering her attraction to a male teacher, the punks decide to pretend that the teach wants to meet her in a motel room, all-the-while they'll have a camera recording her undressing and making a fool of herself. The jig is up when one of em busts out of the bathroom and surprises her with the camera, causing her to frantically run outside, and in a fit of rage, to the next room, where the group of teens are hiding. She attempts to fight them, but instead hits her head  on the table,which ultimately kills her--at least, so they thought. After burying her body , they make a pact to not tell anyoneabout it. Luckily for them, she strolls into class the next day a new woman -- short skirt and all. It turns out the night before, she attepted touse her witchcraft to create a love spell in hopes of getting her teacher's affection; hence, why she was so enthused when he supposedly calls out of the blue wanting to meet her in a motel. Apparently the spell causes her to return from the dead because she is now bound  to the teacher and not even death can stop them from being togethor. The only remotely original thing this movie offers is the fact that Tamara can control anyone she touches.This leads to interesting deaths for our group and anyone else who stands in her way. Although the deaths are interesting, I felt like the film was holding back its potential of being a solid horror entry. Maybe I was just expecting more gore, or more on screen action-- like in one sequence someone cuts their ear,tongue, and stabs themself in the eye. A sequence like that given with the right make up effects--could have been a sweet watch. Instead we see mostly the person's  hand  and a fair amount of blood. I suppose I was sucked into the hype this movie has been getting. I wanted to like this, but given that it's unoriginal and doesn't offer anything interesting other than the on-screen deaths, I looked towards the potential gore to save itself, but instead we don't even get that. If you were like me expecting a throwback of cheesy 80s gore-flick, then expect to be disappointed as I was. Overall it was unoriginal, but does offer intresting deaths, but sadly, the deaths are the only thing remotely decent about the film. Also do not expect a lot of gore like I did. I recomend checking it out on DVD first but do not expect a lot from it. I would give it a 6 out of 10 if that helps you decide.

The story revolves around a teenager [played well by newcomer Jenna Dewan] who is a misfit at school, her only motivation being a well-meaning teacher [played by Matthew Marsden], and a kind friend in the form of Chloe [Katie Stuart]. Tamara gets into the bad books of some of the popular kids in school when her expose on doping in athletics is published in the school paper...this sets the scene for a cruel prank that goes horribly awry when Tamara ends up dead and is buried in the woods. The twist here is that Tamara was also a novice witch who dabbled in the black arts, and she returns from the grave as a sexy, malicious vixen hell-bent on exacting her revenge on all who cross her, including some innocents, such as her English teacher upon whom she has a crush, his wife and even Chloe. Though the plot is really nothing new, and has been done in different variations, Jenna Dewan's Tamara is sufficiently convincing and compelling to watch, and the methods she uses to get back at her enemies, though not highly original, nevertheless make for entertaining viewing.
