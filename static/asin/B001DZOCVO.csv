I can't understand why there are other shows that are not so good but come out sooner. This one (and Just Shoot Me!) had taken a long time.If you saw the show you know what it is all about. The Special Features are good, specially the part where Jim tells us the inside about the show, the characters and even the set up and mementos by the fridge that remind everyone one the set about their families and loved ones.My only regret is that I finished watching the whole season already and there isn't even a date for the second season or a way to subscribe -like they always have here at Amazon- to be notified when it will come out.Don't miss it. It's funny! Jim and his brother in law make a great pair. I like the fact that unlike other family sitcoms, Jim does wrong most of the time but you don't actually blame him but empathize with him because he is a regular guy not pretending to be ""perfect... husband or father"" but instead, the everyday family man that makes mistakes and has fun ... messing things up.

And, we don't have to buy 1/2 year productions like ""Three Sons"".  James Belushi is great!  Sure, some episodes are very melodramatic like most sitcoms, but many story-lines are easy to envision happening in our own lives.  I rate this as good as ""2 1/2 Men"".

1184161,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B001DZOCVO,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[1, 2]","I don't know why a lot of people want According to Jim off the air. It is very funny even if Jim is a lieing jerk who's a bad example for his kids. Still, I'm not sure why the fact that James Belushi has a show gets picked on by shows like the Simpsons. Homer had a fit in one episode because the show was still on the air. Belushi is funny and does a good job in the show.However, it's the supporting cast that mostly keeps me watching. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is super cute as Jim's sister in-law Dana and one of the reasons I even got into the show. I did like her more when she was single though lol. While Larry Joe Campbell gets lots of laughs as Jim's best friend and brother in-law Andy. Courtney Thorne-Smith does under-rated work as Jim's wife Cheryl as well. The kids are cute too.The show is funny but it's very different than the ABC TGIF shows that I grew up with and Home Improvement as well. That doesn't mean that I wish it had mushy and cutsie aww moments like Full House and Family Matters though. But no way should it out live Home Improvement though, which was a much more fun show to watch. According to Jim is a sleazy but funny show and is certainly better than the recent comedies it out lasted on ABC. I'd watch it over the Caveman show any day, but then again who wouldn't.",4,Good for a laugh,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",2008,1302,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'lot', 'people', 'want', 'According', 'Jim', 'air', 'very', 'funny', 'even', 'Jim', 'lieing', 'jerk', 'who', 'bad', 'example', 'kids', 'Still', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'fact', 'James', 'Belushi', 'show', 'picked', 'shows', 'Simpsons', 'Homer', 'had', 'fit', 'one', 'episode', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'air', 'Belushi', 'funny', 'good', 'job', 'show.However', 'supporting', 'cast', 'mostly', 'watching', 'Kimberly', 'Williams-Paisley', 'super', 'cute', 'Jim', 'sister', 'in-law', 'Dana', 'one', 'reasons', 'even', 'got', 'show', 'did', 'like', 'more', 'when', 'was', 'single', 'lol', 'Larry', 'Joe', 'Campbell', 'lots', 'laughs', 'Jim', 'best', 'friend', 'brother', 'in-law', 'Andy', 'Courtney', 'Thorne-Smith', 'under-rated', 'work', 'Jim', 'wife', 'Cheryl', 'as', 'well', 'kids', 'are', 'cute', 'too.The', 'show', 'funny', 'very', 'different', 'ABC', 'TGIF', 'grew', 'up', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'mean', 'wish', 'had', 'mushy', 'cutsie', 'aww', 'moments', 'Full', 'House', 'Family', 'Matters', 'way', 'should', 'out', 'live', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'show', 'watch', 'According', 'Jim', 'sleazy', 'funny', 'show', 'certainly', 'better', 'recent', 'comedies', 'out', 'lasted', 'ABC', ""'d"", 'watch', 'Caveman', 'show', 'day', 'then', 'again', 'who', 'would', ""n't""]",According to Jim: Season 1
