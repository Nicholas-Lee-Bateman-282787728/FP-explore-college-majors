The big ones, like Singing in the Rain and American in Paris, but also many of the lesser known films.  Will leave you shaking your head on how anyone could dance like this. As pointed out in the film, his dancing appealed to men as well as women. His physical abilities made dancing look both artistic and athletic. He created dance numbers never tried before, and not seen since on the silver screen. In addition to all this, the film quality is  unbelievable.  Nearly every movie clip was restored to better than original condition. The colors and clarity, especially on a high def tv, are so sharp you will not believe these are 50+ year old movie clips.

Pawl ""Dani""","[31, 31]","This documentary provides real insight into the man, Gene Kelly, behind the dancing shoes, flashy choreography and ""leading man"" status in countless musicals.  It opens with two men discussing the meaning of life, and one of them refers to Kelly's ""Singin' In the Rain"" sequence as being one of the most beautiful scenes ever filmed in the movies.  I think it is safe to say that many of us will agree.........and those of us who don't agree, probably haven't seen the movie yet!  (and they should!)This film takes a look at Gene, through the eyes of his daughter, his first wife, his co-stars, film critics, and juxtaposes these views with clips of some amazing dance numbers.  There was even rare footage of Gene Kelly, before he became the star he remains to be today, preserved in film and in our hearts and minds.  This was of his footwork in a staged version of the musical, ""Pal Joey.""  This young man, who started out as an Econ major, and then went on to fluorish as an accomplished dancer, and even taught lessons, was brimming with talent from the beginning.  What made Kelly so accessible as a dancer and performer, was his universal, down-to-earth appeal.  He was truly the ""every man.""  This is made reference to on several occasions, as the documentary progressed. Gene made dancing masculine, and something that men should not only feel free to do (like a sport), but also something they should take pride in.This is definitely a ""must see.""",5,"wonderful, informative and entertaining....",1123113600,"08 4, 2005",2005,1457,"['documentary', 'real', 'insight', 'man', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'dancing', 'shoes', 'flashy', 'choreography', 'leading', 'man', 'status', 'countless', 'musicals', 'two', 'men', 'discussing', 'meaning', 'life', 'one', 'refers', 'Kelly', 'Singin', 'Rain', 'sequence', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'ever', 'filmed', 'movies', 'think', 'safe', 'say', 'many', 'will', 'agree', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'probably', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'yet', 'should', 'film', 'look', 'Gene', 'eyes', 'daughter', 'first', 'wife', 'co-stars', 'film', 'critics', 'views', 'clips', 'amazing', 'dance', 'numbers', 'was', 'even', 'rare', 'footage', 'Gene', 'Kelly', 'became', 'star', 'be', 'today', 'preserved', 'film', 'hearts', 'minds', 'was', 'footwork', 'staged', 'version', 'musical', 'Pal', 'Joey', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'started', 'out', 'Econ', 'major', 'then', 'went', 'fluorish', 'accomplished', 'dancer', 'even', 'taught', 'lessons', 'was', 'brimming', 'talent', 'beginning', 'What', 'made', 'Kelly', 'so', 'accessible', 'dancer', 'performer', 'was', 'universal', 'down-to-earth', 'appeal', 'was', 'truly', 'man', 'made', 'reference', 'several', 'occasions', 'documentary', 'progressed', 'Gene', 'made', 'dancing', 'masculine', 'something', 'men', 'should', 'not', 'only', 'feel', 'free', 'do', 'like', 'sport', 'also', 'something', 'should', 'take', 'pride', 'in.This', 'definitely', 'must', 'see']",Gene Kelly: Anatomy of a Dancer

Originally aired as part of PBS's ""American Masters"" series, the film follows Kelly's life and career chronologically with an obvious emphasis on his golden decade between his 1942 film debut co-starring with Judy Garland in ""For Me and My Gal"" to his career peak as star, choreographer and co-director (with prot&eacute;g&eacute; Stanley Donen) of 1952's ""Singin' in the Rain"".While his artistry and perfectionism are well-known with the results proving as much, Kelly is also portrayed fairly for his ego-driven decisions, intolerance for others who did not uphold his standards and an almost obsessive need for attention. But his intentions were clear, and his first wife, actress Betsy Blair, who provides the most cogent and insightful comments among the interviewees, shrewdly observes Kelly's desire to democratize dance for the masses. So focused on this idea was Kelly that he even produced a 1958 TV special, ""Dancing: A Man's Game"", excerpts of which are shown in the film showing how dance and professional sports were akin to one another.The film spotlights memorable moments - his newspaper-tearing dance in ""Summer Stock"", the impressionistic ballet finale from ""An American in Paris"", the roller skating number in ""It's Always Fair Weather"" and of course, his effusive turn in a downpour in ""Singin' in the Rain"". His failures are also documented - an all-dance film, 1956's ""Invitation to the Dance"", held back from release for four years; 1955's ""It's Always Fair Weather"", the cynical flip side to ""On the Town""; his leaden direction of 1969's elephantine disappointment, ""Hello, Dolly!"". Several of Kelly's surviving colleagues are interviewed in brief though telling clips - Debbie Reynolds, Cyd Charisse, Leslie Caron among others.The inevitable comparisons with his only comparable contemporary, Fred Astaire, are here, but the analysis of their individual styles is thoughtful and respectful to both. For me, Kelly is undeniably brilliant but somewhat aware of it in his onscreen persona, which comes across at times as abrasive and preening. His last years are given just a cursory glance as he was beset with illness, but it would have been nice to see his valedictory turns in 1967's ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" or even the soft shoe he does in 1980's execrable ""Xanadu"". No matter as Trachtenberg has made an exemplary record of a most accomplished career.

713399,A3F0AFTVKFAMZZ,B00006FDCQ,Marvin D. Pipher,"[0, 0]","Gene Kelly is arguably the greatest and most innovative dancer in American history, with a career spanning the period from the mid-1920s almost until his death in 1996.  During that period he performed as a singer, dancer, actor, choreographer, and director; and is credited with creating the American style of dance and for starring in what is generally considered to be the greatest musical of all time, &#8216;Singing in the Rain.&#8217;Trained by his mother as a child, Kelly teamed with his brother, Fred, on the stage in the 1920s and honed his skills as a dancer and choreographer while working at his Mother&#8217;s dance studio during the first great depression.  His big break came when he was signed to play in the original Broadway production of &#8216;Pal Joey.&#8217;  This led to the motion picture career which made his a household name.This DVD tells his story primarily through selected dance routines from his more popular films; but also through interviews with his first wife, his children, his dance partners, and friends and associates who knew him.  It&#8217;s a great story about a great personality, told in words and film.

I use to be a tap and ballet dancer and have always loved his style and athleticism. By far, in my personal opinion, he was the best, the other movies I ordered, ""King & I"", ""There's No Business Like Show Business"", ""The Three Muskateers"", ""George M"" and others were all favorites of ours from a wonderful era of Classic movies. I gave these to my husband for our 50th Wedding Anniversary on March 23, 2012.  He was always trying to record them and running out of space on our tv, and now we know where and when to find others. It's a wonderful time when we can take the evening to enjoy a great movie and dancing.  We're still saving our entertainment money for ""Singing in the Rain.""
