Given the material they had, what might have emerged from this footage is probably an unflinching documentary which examines ""the life"" in prostitution.  Instead, what we have is about one short film's worth of fictitious narrative-film footage, shot with big-name actors and proper production values, intercut with narratively befuddled interviews that don't build towards anything, and some of the worst ""special effects"" I've ever seen on a commercially available DVD product.Director Luna (Maria Lidon)'s ""post-modern techniques"" are the main thing that screwed this film up.  The film is so busy throwing transitions, still photographs and random imagery at you that it forgets to draw you in.  Editing decisions appear to have been made based on what might look cool visually instead of what's engaging dramatically.  And Lord knows why Daryl Hannah (who made a blazing comeback in the Kill Bill films), the terrific Joaquim de Almeida, and mainstream star Denise Richards agreed to be in this crap -- it looks like the producers ran out of money a quarter of the way through production and tried to patch it up with ""verite"" documentary footage shot on the cheap and bad, low-grade stills and videography effects.Most grievously, the narrative footage and the documentary footage don't connect.  The only way this intercutting style could work is if the two halves are relatively balanced in proportion (think of the voice-over segments and the story segments in the first two thirds of Memento), and if each half is directly relevant to the other.  But the documentary segments in The Life are narratively aimless, and fail to really establish the characters of the prostitutes, gigolos and madams who populate them.  And the fictional segments added together form a completely generic girl-turned-prostitute story that hits all the tired story marks, with nary a unique dramatic moment in sight.  Two bad films edited together do not make a good one...in fact, The Life feels like one and a half bad films.  The documentary segment alone, if properly put together, might have been interesting (provided you kill those cheesy effects), and the narrative segments might have formed an acceptable if unremarkable short narrative film.  Instead, together, each only serves to deepen the other's stink.If you want a story about the sex industry, try This Girl's Life, which was a relatively sensitive, engaging look at an internet porn star, with fine acting moments from Juliette Marquis, James Woods and Michael Rapaport.  The Life, on the other hand, is a pointless exercise in post-modern b.s. videography and editing which tries to show off its hipness but ends up flushing its own potential assets down the toilet.",1,"Crappy filmmaking, completely incongruous elements.",1108166400,"02 12, 2005",2005,2767,"['film', 'botched', 'rough', 'cut', 'Given', 'material', 'had', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'emerged', 'footage', 'probably', 'unflinching', 'documentary', 'life', 'prostitution', 'Instead', 'what', 'have', 'one', 'short', 'film', 'worth', 'fictitious', 'narrative-film', 'footage', 'shot', 'big-name', 'actors', 'proper', 'production', 'values', 'intercut', 'narratively', 'befuddled', 'interviews', 'do', ""n't"", 'build', 'towards', 'anything', 'worst', 'special', 'effects', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'commercially', 'available', 'DVD', 'product.Director', 'Luna', 'Maria', 'Lidon', 'post-modern', 'techniques', 'are', 'main', 'thing', 'screwed', 'film', 'up', 'film', 'so', 'busy', 'throwing', 'transitions', 'still', 'photographs', 'random', 'imagery', 'draw', 'Editing', 'decisions', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'based', 'what', 'might', 'look', 'cool', 'visually', 'instead', 'what', 'engaging', 'dramatically', 'Lord', 'why', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'who', 'made', 'blazing', 'comeback', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'films', 'terrific', 'Joaquim', 'de', 'Almeida', 'mainstream', 'star', 'Denise', 'Richards', 'agreed', 'be', 'crap', 'producers', 'ran', 'money', 'quarter', 'way', 'production', 'tried', 'patch', 'up', 'verite', 'documentary', 'footage', 'shot', 'cheap', 'bad', 'low-grade', 'stills', 'videography', 'effects.Most', 'grievously', 'narrative', 'footage', 'documentary', 'footage', 'do', ""n't"", 'connect', 'only', 'way', 'intercutting', 'style', 'could', 'work', 'two', 'halves', 'are', 'relatively', 'balanced', 'proportion', 'think', 'voice-over', 'segments', 'story', 'segments', 'first', 'two', 'thirds', 'Memento', 'half', 'directly', 'relevant', 'other', 'documentary', 'segments', 'Life', 'are', 'narratively', 'aimless', 'fail', 'really', 'establish', 'characters', 'prostitutes', 'gigolos', 'madams', 'who', 'populate', 'fictional', 'segments', 'added', 'together', 'form', 'completely', 'generic', 'girl-turned-prostitute', 'story', 'tired', 'story', 'marks', 'unique', 'dramatic', 'moment', 'sight', 'Two', 'bad', 'films', 'edited', 'together', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'good', 'one', 'fact', 'Life', 'feels', 'one', 'half', 'bad', 'films', 'documentary', 'segment', 'alone', 'properly', 'put', 'together', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'provided', 'kill', 'cheesy', 'effects', 'narrative', 'segments', 'might', 'have', 'formed', 'acceptable', 'unremarkable', 'short', 'narrative', 'film', 'Instead', 'together', 'only', 'deepen', 'other', 'stink.If', 'want', 'story', 'sex', 'industry', 'try', 'Girl', 'Life', 'was', 'relatively', 'sensitive', 'engaging', 'look', 'internet', 'porn', 'star', 'fine', 'acting', 'moments', 'Juliette', 'Marquis', 'James', 'Woods', 'Michael', 'Rapaport', 'Life', 'other', 'hand', 'pointless', 'exercise', 'post-modern', 'b.s', 'videography', 'editing', 'show', 'off', 'hipness', 'up', 'flushing', 'own', 'potential', 'assets', 'down', 'toilet']",N/A

867717,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006H31N0,Grady Harp,"[7, 10]","Mar&iacute;a Lid&oacute;n directed 'Yo puta' ('The Life') based on material and story by Adela Iba&ntilde;ez and Isabel Pisano, tied in three established actors (Daryl Hannah, Denise Richards, and Joaquim de Almeida), and creative camera work (visual manipulations, frame freezing, etc) by Ricardo Aronovich  - all with the apparent intent of explaining the etiologies and manifestations of the life of prostitutes.  And while many viewers find the m&eacute;lange of effects (real time interviews with fictional superimposed storyline)  too edgy to digest, for this viewer  Lid&oacute;n succeeds in informing her audience about the motivations and insights from honest prostitutes, gigolos, and their pimps with a gracious style.Searching for a format to tie these interviews together, the writers paired a fictional prostitute (Hannah) with an Anthropology student (Denise Richards) working on a book of interviews with prostitutes.  Their roles are minor.  Where the film succeeds is in the selection of interviewees - mostly Spanish (the film is from Spain), but including French, Eastern European, and other nationality women and men.  The moments with these people are magical showing primarily the soft interior of most of the women who know precisely what they are doing and why: there are messages of survival and true courage as well as libidinous abandonment!There are rough spots in the film, extended moments that cry for editing, but the overall result is informative, creative and entertaining.

She does with mixed results.

It's not there to be enjoyed or to entertain; And it's more like a documentary with a pointless storyline involving Denise Richards and Daryl Hannah. The only reason I rented this movie was because Richards and Hannah were on the cover and it has a tagline that says ""What's your pleasure?"" Well, Richards and Hannah is a good start. I rented it and only when I got home did I realize that it's got a pitiful storyline interwoven with interviews. The movie is a little over 70 minutes. This is a rough estimate, but about 55 minutes is interviews...The storyline is barely there, the filmmakers have thrown the two actresses on the cover to get people to do exactly what I did. Grab the movie. They would've been better off editing out all of Richards and Hannah's stuff, because basically it's about A graduate student (Richards) who's neighbor is a prostitute (Hannah). Her grant is running out and she needs to make money, so she (kinda) takes up the world's oldest profession. There is almost no character development and you feel nothing for any of these characters. The interviews (which claim that the people aren't actors, but their dialogue sounds very scripted) don't really do what the filmmakers want. They don't leave you mortified and haunted, they basically tell you what you were already aware of and they don't speak that graphically. It's the final scene, where each prostitute reveals where they see themselves in a few years. It's a sad to see that some of these people have dug themselves so deep into this profession that they're not even sure how to dig themselves out.

I personally like foreign films so the subtitles did not bother me. They showed all aspects of the life and it could be likened to the episode of taboo about prostitution.  People who disliked this movie were probably hoping to see a ton of gratuitous sex or a porno.  It was well made and outside of some initial confusion about which women were what with regards to Denise and the other I enjoyed it especially because it was seamy and authentic.  People complaining about the subtitles should have simply not watched it and those complaining about not seeing enough of Richards clearly weren't picking up that the entire movie was about a PhD student doing interviews and well as an author she wants to remain out of the picture so the reader(viewer) focuses on their research.I also thought the characters were authentic. They portrayed the positive side as well as the negative. The only part I didn't like was when Richards decided to do the porn I did find that to be cliche and not at all necessary or really that realistic especially as her funding for her PhD would have already been known far in advance as it seems she was completing her dissertation.,4,"A unique, culturally diverse look into the sex industry.",1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,1301,"['initially', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'terrible', 'b', 'movie', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'offered', 'real', 'look', 'sex', 'industry', 'personally', 'foreign', 'films', 'subtitles', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'showed', 'aspects', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'likened', 'episode', 'taboo', 'prostitution', 'People', 'who', 'disliked', 'movie', 'were', 'probably', 'hoping', 'see', 'ton', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'porno', 'was', 'well', 'made', 'initial', 'confusion', 'women', 'were', 'what', 'regards', 'Denise', 'other', 'enjoyed', 'especially', 'was', 'seamy', 'authentic', 'People', 'complaining', 'subtitles', 'should', 'have', 'simply', 'not', 'watched', 'complaining', 'not', 'seeing', 'enough', 'Richards', 'clearly', 'were', ""n't"", 'picking', 'up', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'PhD', 'student', 'doing', 'interviews', 'well', 'author', 'remain', 'picture', 'reader', 'viewer', 'research.I', 'also', 'thought', 'characters', 'were', 'authentic', 'portrayed', 'positive', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'negative', 'only', 'part', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'when', 'Richards', 'decided', 'do', 'porn', 'did', 'find', 'be', 'cliche', 'not', 'necessary', 'really', 'realistic', 'especially', 'funding', 'PhD', 'would', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'known', 'far', 'advance', 'was', 'completing', 'dissertation']",N/A

Intercut are numerous bits from a series of actual interviews of prostitutes of all types, a few madams, a dominatrix and a couple porn film performers, as well as some clients, a couple porn photographers, and a cold-eyed young Eastern European sex-slaver.  The link between the two disparate elements of the film appears to be Richards' character's ongoing interviews for a book on prositution she's doing and, under Hannah's tutelage, a first-hand foray into prostitution when her grant money runs out.  As far as I can tell after one viewing, no effort is made to explain why the interviews are done, for the most part, in subtitled Spanish, obviously shot in Europe.  Without knowing the background, it appears to me the producers tried to market what would have been a routine documentary with a fictional storyline and some star appeal, whether or not it was taken from a book.
