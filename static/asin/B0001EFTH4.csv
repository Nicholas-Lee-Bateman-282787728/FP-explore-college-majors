Some of them were negative and it almost led me not to buy it. I am glad I did. I bought it for 2 reasons: Steve Martin and Tom Welling.  After being a fan of Steve Martin for years and a new fan of Tom Welling, I wanted to see how they could pull this off. I think they did a good job. In an age where few good family movies are made, this is a good family movie.Steve Martin is the drive of this movie. When you have 12 kids to show, it is not easy to get all of them equal time but the writers and and directors seemed to handle the problem well and it is balanced. Yes, there are some times that are ""busy"" in this movie, but what would you expect from a family with 12 kids.The other reason I bought this was Tom Welling. This guy is growing everyday as a better actor. I hope that he will be noticed by more Hollywood execs for the talent he has and he is building. In this movie he showed that he can be funny and be the Man of Steel on TV. I think that he would have been a better choice as the new movie Superman than that other guy they hired, simply because he has more talent. I have loved Superman since I was a kid, but Superman Returns was the only movie I have watched in a theatre that made me fall asleep less than 30 minutes into it. I tried to watch it again but just couldn't, it had the same affect.Take it from a family man of three young girls. Buy the movie, get some popcorn and enjoy it.

801892,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0001EFTH4,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","There may be nothing new and exciting to find within this family comedy, but that doesn't mean it's not worthwhile entertainment.  This remake of the 1950's comedy is funny despite its generic formulistic plot and execution.  The cast works well together, even down to the smallest of toddlers, and everyone seems to be having a really good time making this film.  Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt are just perfectly cast, especially Hunt who I just adore, and the group of young actors, rising stars if you may, all work well to move the film along smoothly.  The plot may be very much been-there-done-that, but you'll be hard pressed these days to find a truly original plot, especially in this particular genre.The film follows this large family as they move into a new home closer to their father's new coaching job.  This means that the children must start over at a new school in a new neighborhood with new friends.  This is hard, especially for the other kids (Hilary Duff & Tom Welling) who are leaving behind significant others and close friends.  Around the same time that their father gets his new job their mother publishes a book chronicling her life with twelve children and with a new book comes a book tour which means for the first time since their birth their mother is going to be leaving them in the caring arms of their father, who will now have to juggle child raising with his job.  With their mother away the children decide to take matters into their own hands and force their parents to move back to their old home and their old neighborhood to their old life.The hi-jinx are predictable, outlandish and unoriginal, but their still funny, and Steve Martin is very effective as the clueless father.  Piper Perabo makes a very limited cameo as their oldest daughter and turns out a somewhat uninspired performance.  I don't know what happened to this girl.  I would have thought given her strong `Coyote Ugly' debut that she would have a nice resume for herself by now, but alas she's resorted to small cameos and supporting roles that do nothing for her.  Ashton Kutcher on the other hand makes the most of his small role and delivers a genuinely funny performance.  His self absorbed model boyfriend to Perabo's doting daughter is just the perfect compliment within contradiction.So, in the end it may not be the perfect family film, but it's well worth the time and is a film the whole family will find amusement in, regardless of its blatant familiarity.",3,"It may not be original, and it's certainly not perfect, but it sure is fun...",1186531200,"08 8, 2007",2007,2479,"['may', 'be', 'nothing', 'new', 'exciting', 'find', 'family', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'mean', 'not', 'worthwhile', 'entertainment', 'remake', '1950', 'comedy', 'funny', 'generic', 'formulistic', 'plot', 'execution', 'cast', 'well', 'together', 'even', 'down', 'smallest', 'toddlers', 'everyone', 'be', 'having', 'really', 'good', 'time', 'making', 'film', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'are', 'just', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'especially', 'Hunt', 'who', 'just', 'adore', 'group', 'young', 'actors', 'rising', 'stars', 'may', 'work', 'well', 'move', 'film', 'smoothly', 'plot', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'been-there-done-that', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'days', 'find', 'truly', 'original', 'plot', 'especially', 'particular', 'genre.The', 'film', 'large', 'family', 'move', 'new', 'home', 'closer', 'father', 'new', 'coaching', 'job', 'children', 'must', 'start', 'new', 'school', 'new', 'neighborhood', 'new', 'friends', 'hard', 'especially', 'other', 'kids', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'who', 'are', 'leaving', 'significant', 'others', 'close', 'friends', 'same', 'time', 'father', 'new', 'job', 'mother', 'book', 'chronicling', 'life', 'twelve', 'children', 'new', 'book', 'book', 'tour', 'first', 'time', 'birth', 'mother', 'going', 'be', 'leaving', 'caring', 'arms', 'father', 'who', 'will', 'now', 'have', 'juggle', 'child', 'raising', 'job', 'mother', 'away', 'children', 'decide', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'force', 'parents', 'move', 'back', 'old', 'home', 'old', 'neighborhood', 'old', 'life.The', 'hi-jinx', 'are', 'predictable', 'outlandish', 'unoriginal', 'still', 'funny', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'very', 'effective', 'clueless', 'father', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'very', 'limited', 'cameo', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'out', 'somewhat', 'uninspired', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'girl', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'given', 'strong', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'debut', 'would', 'have', 'nice', 'resume', 'herself', 'now', 'resorted', 'small', 'cameos', 'supporting', 'roles', 'do', 'nothing', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'other', 'hand', 'most', 'small', 'role', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'performance', 'self', 'absorbed', 'model', 'boyfriend', 'Perabo', 'doting', 'daughter', 'just', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'contradiction.So', 'end', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'perfect', 'family', 'film', 'well', 'time', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'will', 'find', 'amusement', 'regardless', 'blatant', 'familiarity']",N/A

It's incredibly moving, hilarious in just about all aspects and makes you realise just how important family is above the materialism of life.The acting from the kids is surprising and sincere. They are believable and really do show the emotion, which would be hard for some kids to concentrate on in a drama role, but they pull it off perfectly. Little Mark Baker is just the most adorable character! He'll steal your heart away.At first, this movie didn't impress me much. It seemed a little cheesy, too much Hollywood and not enough depth. On second viewing, I realised the great potential this movie really had.Unlike some films, they really do try to give the viewer something worthwhile to learn from and get something out of the movie. Something that will carry on and be remembered long after you leave the cinema.Perhaps some parents may get some insight through watching this film and realise the way their kids may be feeling.It is one movie which doesn't ever seem to grow old; as funny as the first time and always a pleasure to watch.If you're looking for lighthearted yet moving comedy with a line up of great actors and boredom-ceasing potential, this is the movie for you.

801895,A3FVAWZNKW9GX,B0001EFTH4,"A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com ""What should ...","[1, 2]","Critically, I think ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is worth three stars, but I laughed so hard I must give it five to be honest.Remember those old Disney movies from the 1960s that were good, clean fun? This is just like Disney used to be, in the farcical style of ""Love Bug."" There's no fantasy, but there is the improbable 14 person, one dog family.For a movie to be a ""good clean family movie"" there must be no adult sensuality scenes, humor every generation will appreciate, and the end of the movie must encourage family love. A little slapstick is appropriate, but no real violence. ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" has all of that. Outside of one daughter, age 22, living with her boyfriend, the movie sails sharply away from anything scandalous.When Tom (Steve Martin) is offered his dream job, he gets the chance to make something of himself. His current job is as a football coach at Lincoln College, a small school in central Illinois. The new job, which he takes, is at Illinois Polytechnic University (essentially Northwestern University).For Tom, the drive is the usual: Could he make it as the coach of a Division I school, especially at his alma mater? He wasn't unsatisfied with his job or his life at Lincoln. The IPU job fell into his lap, but it promised potential accolades he never received as a football player, a big multiyear salary, and the resources only a big school coach has access.For his family, the sell was hard. Tom pointed out they would have more material things, a relevant concern with a family with a dozen children. A few wore hand-me-downs, and Tom rightfully wanted the best for his brood. Still, the kids loved their home and friends. Leaving that life seemed unimaginable.They move north to Evanston in a beautiful home with stereotypical aloof wealthy neighbors. No one is friendly. The high school football team teases the oldest boy, Charlie (played by TV 'Superboy' Tom Welling with the same personality but no superpowers).As if the old lady already had so many children, Kate (Bonnie Hunt) takes off for a few weeks in New York to publish her first book. The family is still acclimating to Chicago and can't bear this loss of parental leadership. Everything falls into humorous disarray.One downside in considering it as family fare is the attitudes of the children when Kate is gone. Most are selfish and conniving, looking for ways to manipulate their father into returning the family back to their small town lifestyle.Tom's desire is to have it all -- the good job, the solid family, the wife who can explore her professional goals. His ability to pull it off is where it becomes hilarious, in the manner of ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.""Some extremely, gut-hurting funny scenes can be found in ""Cheaper by the Dozen,"" so long as you can tolerate one of the kids slipping in vomit, a dog chewing in an unmentionable area of Hank, a boyfriend (Ashton Krutcher, playing the same personality as ""That Seventies Show""), and some pranks that are almost lifted out of ""Home Alone.""The movie only toys with the relationship between one family and the Bakers, but seems bent on making a statement ""Big city bad, small town good.""""Cheaper by the Dozen"" follows a predictable path. No surprises in the plot, the ending or any of the smaller adventures within the subplots. Not everything is realistic, and not every storyline is provided an ending. However, for a fun, silly movie that finishes off with a strong pro-family sentiment, I fully recommend it.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",5,Funny Family Farce Full of Folly,1082160000,"04 17, 2004",2004,3557,"['Critically', 'think', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'worth', 'three', 'stars', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'must', 'give', 'five', 'be', 'honest.Remember', 'old', 'Disney', 'movies', '1960s', 'were', 'good', 'clean', 'fun', 'just', 'like', 'Disney', 'used', 'be', 'farcical', 'style', 'Love', 'Bug', 'fantasy', 'improbable', '14', 'person', 'one', 'dog', 'movie', 'be', 'good', 'clean', 'family', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'adult', 'sensuality', 'scenes', 'humor', 'generation', 'will', 'appreciate', 'end', 'movie', 'must', 'encourage', 'family', 'love', 'little', 'slapstick', 'appropriate', 'real', 'violence', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'one', 'daughter', 'age', '22', 'living', 'boyfriend', 'movie', 'sharply', 'away', 'anything', 'scandalous.When', 'Tom', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'offered', 'dream', 'job', 'chance', 'make', 'something', 'current', 'job', 'football', 'coach', 'Lincoln', 'College', 'small', 'school', 'central', 'Illinois', 'new', 'job', 'Illinois', 'Polytechnic', 'University', 'essentially', 'Northwestern', 'University', '.For', 'Tom', 'drive', 'usual', 'Could', 'make', 'coach', 'Division', 'school', 'especially', 'alma', 'mater', 'was', ""n't"", 'unsatisfied', 'job', 'life', 'Lincoln', 'IPU', 'job', 'fell', 'lap', 'promised', 'potential', 'accolades', 'never', 'received', 'football', 'player', 'big', 'multiyear', 'salary', 'resources', 'only', 'big', 'school', 'coach', 'access.For', 'family', 'sell', 'was', 'hard', 'Tom', 'pointed', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'more', 'material', 'things', 'relevant', 'concern', 'family', 'dozen', 'children', 'few', 'wore', 'hand-me-downs', 'Tom', 'rightfully', 'wanted', 'best', 'brood', 'Still', 'kids', 'loved', 'home', 'friends', 'Leaving', 'life', 'seemed', 'unimaginable.They', 'move', 'north', 'Evanston', 'beautiful', 'home', 'stereotypical', 'aloof', 'wealthy', 'neighbors', 'one', 'friendly', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team', 'oldest', 'boy', 'Charlie', 'played', 'TV', ""'Superboy"", 'Tom', 'Welling', 'same', 'personality', 'superpowers', '.As', 'old', 'lady', 'already', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'children', 'Kate', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'off', 'few', 'weeks', 'New', 'York', 'publish', 'first', 'book', 'family', 'still', 'acclimating', 'Chicago', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'loss', 'parental', 'leadership', 'Everything', 'humorous', 'disarray.One', 'downside', 'considering', 'family', 'fare', 'attitudes', 'children', 'when', 'Kate', 'gone', 'Most', 'are', 'selfish', 'conniving', 'looking', 'ways', 'manipulate', 'father', 'returning', 'family', 'back', 'small', 'town', 'lifestyle.Tom', 'desire', 'have', 'good', 'job', 'solid', 'family', 'wife', 'who', 'can', 'explore', 'professional', 'goals', 'ability', 'pull', 'off', 'where', 'hilarious', 'manner', 'Father', 'Bride', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'extremely', 'gut-hurting', 'funny', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'so', 'long', 'can', 'tolerate', 'one', 'kids', 'slipping', 'vomit', 'dog', 'chewing', 'unmentionable', 'area', 'Hank', 'boyfriend', 'Ashton', 'Krutcher', 'playing', 'same', 'personality', 'Show', 'pranks', 'are', 'almost', 'lifted', 'Home', 'Alone', 'movie', 'only', 'relationship', 'one', 'family', 'Bakers', 'bent', 'making', 'statement', 'Big', 'city', 'bad', 'small', 'town', 'good', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'predictable', 'path', 'surprises', 'plot', 'ending', 'smaller', 'adventures', 'subplots', 'Not', 'everything', 'realistic', 'not', 'storyline', 'provided', 'ending', 'However', 'fun', 'silly', 'movie', 'strong', 'pro-family', 'sentiment', 'fully', 'recommend', 'it.Anthony', 'Trendleditor', 'HungarianBookstore.com']",N/A

801898,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0001EFTH4,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 2]","Another year and another re-make. Actually, I never saw the 1950 original, so I have nothing to compare this new one too. A movie like this may not break any new ground or shake the movie industry's fooundations, or stay in the memory long afterwards, but the trip through it to the end is one pleasureable ride. A cotton candy movie. Steve Martin stars as Tom Baker, a small town football coach. He has a wife named Kate(the adorable and always great Bonnie Hunt), and a house full of kids. Quite literally. 12 of them. Ranging from 22(she lives on her own)to pre-school age. Everything is as normal as can be until Tom gets an offer from an old friend to move to Chicago for a big coaching job and a great big new house. Settling in was alredy hard enough, but mom Kate's book based on their family life gets published and she has to go to New York to do the appearances and publicity for it(including a cameo by Regis and Kelly). This leaves Tom to hold down the fort, and with 12 rampaging kids, well, you can guess how it works out. The movie is chaotic and all over the place and the kids are enough to drive anyone to the bottle. Tom Welling of ""Smallville"" fame plays the oldest at home, Charlie, and his brooding ""I hate you"" schtick gets old real fast. Still, he has become quite the idol thanks to his show, and he definitley has the presence to become a najor player in feature films. Teen queen Hilary Duff of ""Lizzie Maguire"" really has nothing to do but look cute and show it off just as she does on her show. Honestly, I didn't see much of a difference between this character and Lizzie. It's kinda hard to actually like the kids(except for the little one they call Fed Ex), and it seems that no one can agree on anything and everyone has to bend over to accomodate eveyone else instead of helping each other to achieve the goals. Still, it ends up in a way you probably saw coming. There's the thing. There is nothing remotely surprising about the movie. We've seen it a hundred times before, but that doesn't mean that a cute, sweet film as enjoyable as this still can't be good and enjoyable if it's down in such a sweet, crowd pleasing way. Steve Martin is perfect for roles like this. His fatherly role in ""Parenthood"" and both ""Father Of The Bride"" movies proved this. And were better. Still, he keeps the movie afloat and that is probaby hard to do with such a large cast of mostly little kids. I adore Bonnie Hunt to death, and she lights up everything she is in. Thank god she has a hit show!. Ashton Kutcher has an uncredited role as Hank, the model/actor boyfriend of their oldest daughter Nora, played by Piper Perabo. He was pretty amusing in the small role he had. Points must also go to director Shawn Levy(who also appeared in the movie as the reporter who asked Coach for a comment). Not onyl did he handle the large cast well, but it musn't of been easy wrangling all of the kids. As the outtakes at the end of the movie showed, it must not of been fun all the time. Especially with the little ones. So, points for him!. When all is said and done, not much will be written about the movie, but it is a crowd pleasing, feel good film that is as sweet as cotton candy and tastes just as good going down.",4,Baker's 12,1081728000,"04 12, 2004",2004,3235,"['year', 're-make', 'Actually', 'never', 'saw', '1950', 'original', 'so', 'have', 'nothing', 'compare', 'new', 'one', 'too', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'break', 'new', 'ground', 'shake', 'movie', 'industry', 'fooundations', 'stay', 'memory', 'long', 'afterwards', 'trip', 'end', 'one', 'pleasureable', 'ride', 'cotton', 'candy', 'movie', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'small', 'town', 'football', 'coach', 'wife', 'named', 'Kate', 'adorable', 'always', 'great', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'house', 'full', 'kids', 'Quite', 'literally', '12', 'Ranging', '22', 'own', 'pre-school', 'age', 'Everything', 'as', 'normal', 'can', 'be', 'Tom', 'offer', 'old', 'friend', 'move', 'Chicago', 'big', 'coaching', 'job', 'great', 'big', 'new', 'house', 'Settling', 'was', 'alredy', 'hard', 'enough', 'mom', 'Kate', 'book', 'based', 'family', 'life', 'published', 'go', 'New', 'York', 'do', 'appearances', 'publicity', 'including', 'cameo', 'Regis', 'Kelly', 'Tom', 'hold', 'down', 'fort', '12', 'rampaging', 'kids', 'well', 'can', 'guess', 'how', 'out', 'movie', 'chaotic', 'place', 'kids', 'are', 'enough', 'drive', 'anyone', 'bottle', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Smallville', 'fame', 'oldest', 'home', 'Charlie', 'brooding', 'hate', 'schtick', 'old', 'real', 'fast', 'Still', 'become', 'quite', 'idol', 'thanks', 'show', 'presence', 'become', 'najor', 'player', 'feature', 'films', 'Teen', 'queen', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'Lizzie', 'Maguire', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'look', 'cute', 'show', 'off', 'just', 'show', 'Honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'difference', 'character', 'Lizzie', 'kinda', 'hard', 'actually', 'kids', 'little', 'one', 'call', 'Fed', 'Ex', 'one', 'can', 'agree', 'anything', 'everyone', 'bend', 'accomodate', 'eveyone', 'else', 'instead', 'helping', 'other', 'achieve', 'goals', 'Still', 'up', 'way', 'probably', 'saw', 'coming', 'thing', 'nothing', 'remotely', 'surprising', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', ""n't"", 'mean', 'cute', 'sweet', 'film', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'enjoyable', 'down', 'such', 'sweet', 'crowd', 'pleasing', 'way', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'perfect', 'roles', 'fatherly', 'role', 'Parenthood', 'Father', 'Bride', 'movies', 'proved', 'were', 'better', 'Still', 'movie', 'afloat', 'probaby', 'hard', 'do', 'large', 'cast', 'mostly', 'little', 'kids', 'adore', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'death', 'up', 'everything', 'Thank', 'god', 'hit', 'show', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'uncredited', 'role', 'Hank', 'model/actor', 'boyfriend', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Nora', 'played', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'was', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'small', 'role', 'had', 'Points', 'must', 'also', 'go', 'director', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'who', 'also', 'appeared', 'movie', 'reporter', 'who', 'asked', 'Coach', 'comment', 'Not', 'onyl', 'did', 'handle', 'large', 'cast', 'well', 'mus', ""n't"", 'been', 'easy', 'wrangling', 'kids', 'outtakes', 'end', 'movie', 'showed', 'must', 'not', 'been', 'fun', 'time', 'Especially', 'little', 'ones', 'So', 'points', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'not', 'much', 'will', 'be', 'written', 'movie', 'crowd', 'pleasing', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'as', 'sweet', 'cotton', 'candy', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'going', 'down']",N/A

801900,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B0001EFTH4,Bill Garrison,"[4, 4]","Cheaper by the dozen is a movie created by a formula where you throw in talented comedic actors like Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt and twelve cute kids and just let the hilarity ensue.  Except it isn't really that easy.Sure, there are funny moments when Martin tries to corral the 12 crazy kids (actually eleven because one (Piper Peraboo) had already moved out and only appears a few times.  Her boyfriend is one of the highlights of the film).  But creating a funny situation with comedic scenes doesn't make a movie if you don't care for the characters.Characterization is where the movie falls short.  Bonnie Hunt is called away on business after she sends her book to a publisher friend and has to go away on a book tour (I didn't know it only took a few weeks to publish a book).  Then Martin gets his dream job as a coach of his alma matter football team.  I think the movie expects us to take this part seriously because football coaching draws Martin away from his family, but the whole football thing is done so poorly, it is hard too.  The football coaching gig loses credibility when Martin brings the team home to practice at his house and his tiny yard and there aren't even 20 players on the entire team.The predictable plot has Martin starting to choose his career over family and in the end choosing family again.  But none of the kids are really memorable.  Hillary Duff and Tom Weilling are some of the bigger stars, but Duff really does nothing.  The little kids each have a few moments of screen time, but with so many characters, there are none to care about and thus no reason to care what decision Martin makes.This is a okay movie if you realize you will see nothing you haven't seen before.

It's just well-hidden under a steaming pile of alleged, paint-by-the-numbers, comedy. You know basically everything that will happen from start to finish. There's no surprise, no smiles and no effort at being more than it is.The movie even suffers from ""End Credit Blooper Syndrome"", which is how you know the filmmakers even knew this was a turkey and figured they might try to solicit a few cheap laughs from you as you leave the theatre in hopes you might remember those cheap laughs and not all the time you spent looking at your watch.I'm at work now and bought this across the street in order to provide myself with some minor amusement. Sadly, even that minor level of amusement eluded me.This film centers around twelve extremely selfish and self-centered children who sabotage their father's efforts at having a career and trying to be a good parent. In doing so, he's managed to secure a huge pay raise, a much larger house and free college for his children. The bastard!Of course, the movie would have you believe that what's really going on is that the father is a Bad Man because he dares to try to have a career and tries to help out his wife so that she can have a career as well (strangely her having a career is not presented as any kind of a problem).This movie is what I would categorize as a ""KOMEDY!"". It's different from a ""comedy"", because in a comedy people do things that make sense and flow logically from what's been happening up to that point. In a KOMEDY! people do things because the script says they do.Case in point: in one scene the children soak someone's underwear in a pile of meat. In the real world, a: someone would have noticed what looks like several pounds of ground meat walking away, and b: no one would be stupid enough to put on underwear that smells of ground meat.Basically this a movie I endured, rather than watched (still better than something like the American version of ""Godzilla"", which can merely be survived and requires a long period of painful recovery afterwords). Steve Martin is a good actor and very funny, and he's the only reason this film gets two stars rather than one (well, and Tom Welling and Ashton Kutcher walking around in not many clothes helps).It's a pity, cause as I said, the basic plot idea here is a good one. But the execution is fatally flawed. Maybe somewhere down the line someone will try again and have more success.

And actually, other than the title and the fact that it involves a family with twelve kids, it bears no resemblance to the book at all. But ""Cheaper by the Dozen"", which stars Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt as the parents of a REALLY big family, is sweet and sorta funny and carries a nice message about spending time with your kids. And in the end that was good enough for me.The Bakers never set out to have twelve children, it just sort of happened, and as the movie opens they are living in chaotic but harmonious discord in a rambling old house in the country. But then Dad gets the job of a lifetime, and the whole brood moves into the city/suburbs, where the kids don't fit in and are miserable and the parents begin to fight and everything starts to fall apart. And them Mom goes on a book tour. Craziness ensues.If you are a pre-teen, teen, or, like me, twenty-three and sad, you will recognize almost every kid in this movie from Disney and WB shows. Tween fave Hilary Duff isn't given much to do and is wasted, but ""Smallville""'s Tom Welling is affecting as the oldest son, even if his plot line is a little ridiculous. (I mean, there is no high school, anywhere in America, where a guy as impossibly gorgeous as Welling would be an outcast. We know a hottie when we see one.)""Cheaper by the Dozen"" doesn't have any really big laughs, but many small ones, and you may get teary-eyed at the end.

The move from the small town life to a much more urban (not too urban though) environment is a shock to the entire family.  I think this movie flows quite well; touches on many different characters (probably the largest and most actively involved cast of any recent movie); and has a very important message:  Sometimes your dreams aren't really what you think they are.This is not a sophisticated comedy geared towards the typical &quot;gourmet coffee drinker - analyze the movie to make sure it talks about human suffering enough&quot; movie-goer, but more towards the crowd who enjoys life for the simple fact they're alive and kicking.Steve Martin always rises to the role.  Hilary Duff, who I normally can't stand, did a good job, too.  The rest of the cast seemed to compliment each other exceedingly well.  The filming (moving shots without breaks) was superb!  The school scenes could have been filmed live at any high school; in other words, very realistic.I'm not sure how someone can give this movie less than five stars...Maybe they thought it was supposed to be a Western?I say, &quot;Buy this film, sit down with the family, and enjoy a nice buttery and oversalted bucket of popcorn while you watch a great flick.&quot;But hey, that's just my opinion...:-)[...]",5,A Movie Firing On All Cylinders!,1081468800,"04 9, 2004",2004,1603,"['opening', 'scene', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'coming', 'long', 'run', 'then', 'sitting', 'lumpy', 'bed', 'actually', 'lumbs', 'were', 'twelve', 'kids', 'covers', 'rolling', 'credits', 'film', 'all.The', 'viewer', 'not', 'have', 'come', 'large', 'family', 'identify', 'problems', 'Baker', 'family', 'move', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'much', 'more', 'urban', 'not', 'too', 'urban', 'environment', 'shock', 'entire', 'family', 'think', 'movie', 'quite', 'well', 'touches', 'many', 'different', 'characters', 'probably', 'largest', 'most', 'actively', 'involved', 'cast', 'recent', 'movie', 'very', 'important', 'message', 'Sometimes', 'dreams', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'what', 'think', 'are.This', 'not', 'sophisticated', 'comedy', 'geared', 'typical', 'quot', 'coffee', 'drinker', 'movie', 'make', 'sure', 'human', 'suffering', 'enough', 'quot', 'movie-goer', 'more', 'towards', 'crowd', 'who', 'life', 'simple', 'fact', ""'re"", 'alive', 'kicking.Steve', 'Martin', 'always', 'role', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'who', 'normally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'too', 'rest', 'cast', 'seemed', 'compliment', 'other', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'filming', 'moving', 'shots', 'breaks', 'was', 'superb', 'school', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'live', 'high', 'school', 'other', 'words', 'very', 'realistic.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'someone', 'can', 'give', 'movie', 'less', 'five', 'stars', 'Maybe', 'thought', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'Western', 'say', 'quot', 'Buy', 'film', 'sit', 'down', 'family', 'enjoy', 'nice', 'buttery', 'oversalted', 'bucket', 'popcorn', 'watch', 'great', 'flick.', 'quot', 'hey', 'just', 'opinion', '[', ']']",N/A

Kate and Thomas Baker (Bonnie Hunt, Steve Martin) are middle class parents trying to juggle careers and restore sanity in the Baker household. The overall result is both dramatic and hilarious, which proves once again why Steve Martin is the master of his craft - wearing two hats as a standout comedic and dramatic actor. Martin was equally as successful as advertising executive Neal Page 16 years earlier in the touching motion picture ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"", where he was dealing with a similar, yet different situational predicament with one Del Griffith ([the late, great] John Candy). But this time, Thomas Baker's worries are 12 times greater, which means 12 times the laughs, and, in some cases, 12 times the tears, as the Baker clan says goodbye to the rural community they'd been attatched to for several years, and hello to the big city. This move opens up new doors for Tom and Kate, as Tom receives an offer to coach football at a local high school for, of course, bigger bucks, and Kate has a book publishing deal looming on the horizon. Also, the Baker children, 12 strong, are also part of this package deal, and when you have this many kids, things are bound to get topsy-turvy, which is the case when Kate leaves for New York to promote her book, while Tom is ""stuck"" in Chicago looking after the kids and his career simultaneously. Of all the younger members of the Baker clan, Hilary Duff's performance stands out the most, and, at 15, her future is bound to get brighter and brighter with each new release. By contrast, Steve Martin, at 58, shows no sign of slowing down, or retiring, for that matter, as a running scene in ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" will attest to that fact. Bonnie Hunt shows her wares as a seasoned actress, and Ashton Kutcher turns in a good performance as well. All of the above qualities make ""Cheaper By The Dozen"" a movie worth seeing. If you weren't one of the lucky ones who caught the November 28th sneak preview, don't despair. It opens in theaters nationwide December 25th. Be sure and take your ""dozen"" to see these ""dozen"".

And, it does have a lot of comedic moments that are genuinely funny.  However, the movie tends to bog down in several areas as a large family struggles to keep it together when the parents' careers both take off.Steve Martin plays Tom Baker, a football coach for a division three team.  Bonnie Hunt plays his wife Kate Baker who has written a novel based on her and Tom's family of 14 (2 adults and 14 kids).  Tom and Kate had always wanted a family with 8 kids, but due to some twins along the way, they ended up with a dozen.  Tom is offered the head coaching job at his alma mater, which is his dream job, just as Kate's book is picked up for publication.  The family packs up, moves to the big city, and struggles to adjust.The younger kids in the family team up to create mischief on several occasions.  This is where most of the comedy comes in.  However, some of the comedy tends to come off as recycled from various parent vs. children movies.  The older children in the family (played by Piper Perabo, Tom Welling, and Hillary Duff) are the most angst ridden by the changes.  They do an admirable but unspectacular job in their roles.The biggest problem with the movie is that it didn't seem to be able to make up its mind as to what kind of movie it would be.  The comedy and the more serious family conflicts frequently didn't mix well.  There are several stretches that are just depressing and a few that are too sentimental.On the bright side, Steve Martin gives a good performance.  He seems to have fallen into the role of 'Dad' nicely after playing one in movies like 'Father of the Bride,' 'Bringing Down the House,' and 'Parenthood.'

But a fun one for young families.Go to it with some enthusiasm if you have young kids (8 & under) because they can relate to the antics, and parental ridiculousness and the general raucousness.If your kids are older, avoid this film because it is too dumb for your teenagers.Story:Steve Martin plays Tom Baker, a very dedicated, loving dad and husband with 12 kids who is a great coach for a small school so he can best care for his family...until he gets his dream position at his old college team.Kate Baker (Bonnie Hunt) his wife decides to publish her book on the wonder and chaos of raising 12 children at the greatest moment of family and spousal need.  Thus, abandoning the life of the great mother/author, she leaves Martin alone with the 12 kids just as they move into their new home, in a big new town, scary new schools, few new friends, and her husbands new demanding job.Some funny scenes, kind of reminds me of the chaos in our own home as we juggle multiple businesses to pay the bills for our children including a severely handicapped child - but ours exists with a supportive wife/mother - so the chaotic pain is supported, not abandoned.I suppose others can say this is a poor movie because the loving Mom really screws everyone else up with her untimely wants.  But, the kids enjoyed it for its fun and frolic.",3,Fun for Young Families - Not for everyone,1076803200,"02 15, 2004",2004,1435,"['.Young', 'families', '3', 'starsEveryone', 'Else', '1-2stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Summary', 'Not', 'good', 'movie', 'everyone', 'fun', 'one', 'young', 'families.Go', 'enthusiasm', 'have', 'young', 'kids', '8', 'can', 'relate', 'antics', 'parental', 'ridiculousness', 'general', 'raucousness.If', 'kids', 'are', 'older', 'avoid', 'film', 'too', 'dumb', 'teenagers.Story', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'very', 'dedicated', 'loving', 'dad', 'husband', '12', 'kids', 'who', 'great', 'coach', 'small', 'school', 'can', 'best', 'care', 'family', 'dream', 'position', 'old', 'college', 'team.Kate', 'Baker', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'wife', 'publish', 'book', 'wonder', 'chaos', 'raising', '12', 'children', 'greatest', 'moment', 'family', 'spousal', 'need', 'Thus', 'abandoning', 'life', 'great', 'mother/author', 'Martin', 'alone', '12', 'kids', 'just', 'move', 'new', 'home', 'big', 'new', 'town', 'scary', 'new', 'schools', 'few', 'new', 'friends', 'husbands', 'new', 'demanding', 'job.Some', 'funny', 'scenes', 'kind', 'reminds', 'chaos', 'own', 'home', 'juggle', 'multiple', 'businesses', 'pay', 'bills', 'children', 'including', 'severely', 'handicapped', 'child', 'ours', 'exists', 'supportive', 'wife/mother', 'so', 'chaotic', 'pain', 'supported', 'not', 'abandoned.I', 'suppose', 'others', 'can', 'say', 'poor', 'movie', 'loving', 'Mom', 'really', 'everyone', 'else', 'untimely', 'kids', 'enjoyed', 'fun', 'frolic']",N/A
801926,A1R2URG8OHNEDS,B0001EFTH4,"Ed Mich ""Ed""","[21, 27]","Steve Martin movies are usually very good. ""Bringing Down the House,"" was great, as was ""Novocaine,"" but now he is starting to go to family movies in ""Cheaper by the Dozen."" ""Cheaper by the Dozen,"" is a remake of a much older movie that was based on a book. The reason I liked this movie was that it was funny, smart, and it was not just an hour and a half of children screaming. Steve Martin was funny in it, very much like he usually is, and I could see them making a sequal out of it, especially since it's already made over a hundred million dollars since Christmas Day.The movie is about Tom and Kate Baker who live in the small town of Midland with their kids. They have twelve of them. Tom is a collage football couch, and his wife is writing a book on her family which is actually called Cheaper by the Dozen. Their oldest daughter Nora has moved out of the house and is living with her model/actor boyfriend Hank. When Tom gets a job offer to couch another football team they move to a new city, much to the dismay of their children, who find out wuickly that they do not fit in the new city. Their next oldest children next to Nora is Charlie, who has made it pretty clear that he does not really like his father, and Lorraine, who is always obsessing about what the family wears, how they look, etc etc. The rest of the children also always make fun of Mark, who is so unlike everybody else in the family, that the kids call him ""Fedex,"" as if he was delivered to them.They are just settling into their new home, and their new life, when Kate gets her book published and she has to go away for two weeks to promote it. Tom states that he could handle the kids for those two weeks, and be able to go to work, so Kate goes. Problems start right away when Nora and Hank come and the kids make it their personal mission to annoy Hank in any way that they can. Take this one scene where they soak his underwear in meat so that the dog would chase after him. It's clever, especially since it was thought up by ten year olds. More problems arise from Kate leaving, and that's pretty much the story to ""Cheaper by the Dozen.""If Tom was played by anybody else then Steve Martin, the movie might not have complety worked. I also don't like the way people always state that they shouldn't make a remake of a classic. I don't compare remakes to the oringal. The remake is a new movie. It's a seprate movie and I think about it, as if the first movie was never made. The same with book adaptations. I see the movie as if the book was never made. That's what you have to do with ""Cheaper by the Dozen."" It's an hour and a half long, and it's funny, with some good acting, and some very funny moments and very funny scenes.ENJOY!Rated PG for language and some thematic elements.",4,A Very Funny Movie!,1074470400,"01 19, 2004",2004,2774,"['Steve', 'Martin', 'movies', 'are', 'usually', 'very', 'good', 'Bringing', 'Down', 'House', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'Novocaine', 'now', 'starting', 'go', 'family', 'movies', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'remake', 'much', 'older', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'reason', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'funny', 'smart', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'hour', 'half', 'children', 'screaming', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'was', 'funny', 'very', 'much', 'usually', 'could', 'see', 'making', 'sequal', 'especially', 'already', 'made', 'over', 'hundred', 'million', 'dollars', 'Christmas', 'Day.The', 'movie', 'Tom', 'Kate', 'Baker', 'who', 'live', 'small', 'town', 'Midland', 'kids', 'have', 'twelve', 'Tom', 'collage', 'football', 'couch', 'wife', 'writing', 'book', 'family', 'actually', 'called', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'Nora', 'moved', 'house', 'living', 'model/actor', 'boyfriend', 'Hank', 'When', 'Tom', 'job', 'offer', 'couch', 'football', 'team', 'move', 'new', 'city', 'much', 'dismay', 'children', 'who', 'find', 'out', 'wuickly', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'new', 'city', 'next', 'oldest', 'children', 'Nora', 'Charlie', 'who', 'made', 'pretty', 'clear', 'not', 'really', 'father', 'Lorraine', 'who', 'always', 'obsessing', 'what', 'family', 'wears', 'how', 'look', 'etc', 'etc', 'rest', 'children', 'also', 'always', 'make', 'fun', 'Mark', 'who', 'so', 'everybody', 'else', 'family', 'kids', 'call', 'Fedex', 'was', 'delivered', 'them.They', 'are', 'just', 'settling', 'new', 'home', 'new', 'life', 'when', 'Kate', 'book', 'published', 'go', 'away', 'two', 'weeks', 'promote', 'Tom', 'could', 'handle', 'kids', 'two', 'weeks', 'be', 'able', 'go', 'work', 'so', 'Kate', 'Problems', 'start', 'right', 'away', 'when', 'Nora', 'Hank', 'come', 'kids', 'make', 'personal', 'mission', 'annoy', 'Hank', 'way', 'can', 'Take', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'soak', 'underwear', 'meat', 'dog', 'would', 'chase', 'clever', 'especially', 'was', 'thought', 'up', 'ten', 'year', 'olds', 'More', 'problems', 'arise', 'Kate', 'leaving', 'pretty', 'much', 'story', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'Tom', 'was', 'played', 'anybody', 'else', 'then', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'movie', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'complety', 'worked', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'people', 'always', 'state', 'should', ""n't"", 'make', 'remake', 'classic', 'do', ""n't"", 'compare', 'remakes', 'oringal', 'remake', 'new', 'movie', 'seprate', 'movie', 'think', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'same', 'book', 'adaptations', 'see', 'movie', 'book', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'hour', 'half', 'long', 'funny', 'good', 'acting', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'very', 'funny', 'scenes.ENJOY', 'Rated', 'PG', 'language', 'thematic', 'elements']",N/A

For he is the father of twelve kids - eleven if you count that one of them has moved out. When Tom is offered a job to coach football at a College in Illinois, and announces that his family is moving, there are complaints all around. But, the money is better, so the Baker family moves to a middle-class neighborhood, where they don't exactly fit in. The teenagers of the family, Charlie (Tom Welling), and Lorraine (Hilary Duff) are constantly in verbal fights with the popular kids; while the younger kids, mainly Jake (Jacob Smith) and Sarah (Alyson Stoner), are in constant fist-fights. The family has pretty much turned into one filled with a bunch of whiners, except when older sister Nora (Piper Perabo), stops by for dinner with her self-obsessed, model/actor boyfriend, Hank (Ashton Kutcher), and the kids wreak havoc on him. When Tom's wife, Kate (Bonnie Hunt), publishes a book, she is immediately sent on the road to plug it's release. Hence, Tom is left to take care of the kids by himself, and problems galore ensue.I have seen Steve Martin (THE MAN WITH TWO BRAINS and L.A. STORY) in various movies, but his role as the clueless, dim-witted, always smiling father in this film was utterly hilarious. Bonnie Hunt (WAITRESS and JERRY MAGUIRE) was fabulous as the mother - a role which she plays in almost every film she's in. Hilary Duff's (THE LIZZIE MCGUIRE MOVIE and A CINDERELLA STORY) role was a little strange, as she seemed to be playing herself thrown into a family of small-town dwellers who don't like the city. but was good in her own right, as she has a cute, bubbly personality that lights up the screen. However, probably one of the best performances came from Ashton Kutcher (THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT and DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR?), as the self-absorbed, waif-like model, who watches his commercials on TV all day, and talks about nothing but himself. Throughout the movie, whenever he appeared on screen it was hard to contain your laughter. Overall, this was a fabulous family film that can be enjoyed by all, even if you don't have a large family.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper",5,One of Steve Martin & Ashton Kutcher's Best Performances,1106265600,"01 21, 2005",2005,2352,"['not', 'easy', 'living', 'house', 'eleven', 'kids', 'dog', 'various', 'slithery', 'creatures', 'make', 'way', 'kitchen', 'worst', 'possible', 'times', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'better', 'anyone', 'father', 'twelve', 'kids', 'eleven', 'count', 'one', 'moved', 'out', 'When', 'Tom', 'offered', 'job', 'coach', 'football', 'College', 'Illinois', 'announces', 'family', 'moving', 'are', 'complaints', 'around', 'money', 'better', 'Baker', 'family', 'moves', 'middle-class', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'fit', 'teenagers', 'family', 'Charlie', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Lorraine', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'are', 'constantly', 'verbal', 'fights', 'popular', 'kids', 'younger', 'kids', 'mainly', 'Jake', 'Jacob', 'Smith', 'Sarah', 'Alyson', 'Stoner', 'are', 'constant', 'fist-fights', 'family', 'pretty', 'much', 'turned', 'one', 'filled', 'bunch', 'whiners', 'when', 'older', 'sister', 'Nora', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'stops', 'dinner', 'self-obsessed', 'model/actor', 'boyfriend', 'Hank', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'kids', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'When', 'Tom', 'wife', 'Kate', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'book', 'immediately', 'sent', 'road', 'plug', 'release', 'Hence', 'Tom', 'left', 'take', 'care', 'kids', 'problems', 'galore', 'ensue.I', 'have', 'seen', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WITH', 'TWO', 'BRAINS', 'L.A.', 'STORY', 'various', 'movies', 'role', 'clueless', 'dim-witted', 'always', 'smiling', 'father', 'film', 'was', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'WAITRESS', 'JERRY', 'MAGUIRE', 'was', 'fabulous', 'mother', 'role', 'almost', 'film', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'THE', 'LIZZIE', 'MCGUIRE', 'MOVIE', 'A', 'CINDERELLA', 'STORY', 'role', 'was', 'little', 'strange', 'seemed', 'be', 'playing', 'thrown', 'family', 'small-town', 'dwellers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'city', 'was', 'good', 'own', 'right', 'cute', 'bubbly', 'personality', 'up', 'screen', 'However', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'came', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'THE', 'BUTTERFLY', 'EFFECT', 'DUDE', 'WHERE', 'MY', 'CAR', 'self-absorbed', 'waif-like', 'model', 'who', 'commercials', 'TV', 'day', 'talks', 'nothing', 'movie', 'whenever', 'appeared', 'screen', 'was', 'hard', 'contain', 'laughter', 'Overall', 'was', 'fabulous', 'family', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'large', 'family.Erika', 'SoroccoBook', 'Review', 'Columnist', 'Community', 'Bugle', 'Newspaper']",N/A
801934,A2HLZFV0UUT9IQ,B0001EFTH4,Family Movie Critic,"[1, 1]","&quot;Cheaper By The Dozen&quot; is a great comedy about the importance of family. When Todd Baker(Steve Martin) lands his dream job of coaching a college football team, he has to move his whole family to Chicago. When his wife(Bonnie Hunt) gets her first book published and has to leave town for a press tour, Todd is faced with the dificult challenge of running a household of 12 kids by himself. The Bakers go through many obstacles that test the strength of their family, including the kids struggling to fit in and Todd's job being threatened. Since there are so many kids ranging in ages from 5 to 18, there is a character that every member of the family can relate to. This movie is humorourous, lighthearted, and unoffensive. The only thing that parents might be concerned about is the eldest daughter(Piper Parabo) and her conceited boyfriend(Ashton Kutcher) do make out for about 3 seconds, before the mom puts a stop to it in a humorous way. There also isn't enough to keep children younger than 6 interested.This is a very disapointing DVD release. I am glad that Fox put both the widescreen and fullscreen versions of the film in the same box, but there are hardley any special features. I like commentaries, and there are two of them on the DVD, but I want to know more about the making of process. There is an interview with the director and deleted scenes.

Is that possible for a woman to concieve that much chidren? Anyway when Martin is offered a pretigious job as football coach for a college team, he persuades the big family to move out of their small town and into the suburbs of Chicago. Things don't go according to plan. Martin is too busy at his job, and Hunt's authoring career is about to take off. When Hunt goes to New York fo a couple of weeks, Martin is left in charge of the household. Of course chaos insues.I liked the dramatic backdrops of the characters. The kids themselves are realistic.

I don't think you can even compare Steve Martin's performance to that of his in &quot;Bringin Down The House&quot;. But I think the only reason he wasn't up to his own standards is due to the fact that you can't have an average family-like movie with just one outstanding character. You just can't.There were some pretty funny parts in it though, I have to admit. But it just wasn't the good old 'laugh-out-loud' kind of funny. It was the kind where you just think 'that's pretty funny' and forget about.And what's up with Hilary Duff? What's next for her, world domination? I wouldn't be surprised. T.V.? Done. Movies? Done. Music? Done. Clothing? Done. I'm kinda getting sick of opening a magazine and seeing her. For instance, in Teen People, in an article called '20 Teens That Will Change The World', guess who was one of them? I mean, aren't you a little bit Hilary Duffed out? But back to the actual movie...It's good entertainment for, you know, younger kids, like 8 and under. In my opinion, for this movie, the older you are, the cornier you'll find it. But, don't get me wrong, it's good for an old 'Family Fun' kick.

She's really got a great streak of ""being human,"" and Martin is totally agreeable, and he really clicks with Hunt.  The ensemble cast of children was wonderful, too, and no, they weren't the Brady Bunch, or the Partridge Family.

801943,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0001EFTH4,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","2003's CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN strays quite a bit from Frank Gilbreth Jr.'s classic 1948 biography book and the genial 1950 film adaptation. This modern-day version is more rambunctious, more catered to the family SUV generation. I found myself liking it - for different reasons - just as much as I did the Clifton Webb/Myrna Loy production.Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt play the scrambling patriarch and matriarch of this chaotic brood. In raising twelve squabbling children, Tom (Martin) and Kate Baker (Hunt) have sacrificed much. And yet they still dream of having it all, of juggling the perfect family life with the successful careers. When Tom gets offered a job coaching college football at his prestigious alma mater and Kate's book takes off, they relocate the fam out of their rural home and into the bustling city, never mind that this puts the kids all out of sorts. In the 'burbs things seem okay on the surface, even though Tom is never home anymore, preoccupied as he is with the new job. But then Kate goes away on a whirlwind national book tour, leaving Tom in charge of the rowdy, feuding Baker clan. It's not too long before the pressures of a big time college program begin to undermine his parenting obligations. If Steve Martin's hair wasn't already white...CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN doesn't resonate as deeply as Martin's previous family pictures (FATHER OF THE BRIDE, PARENTHOOD). CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN does have its strong emotional beats, but mostly the story is played for hijinks. I'm fine with that. I thought this movie was fun. Familiar names are peppered in to offset the diverse cast of fresh kid faces. Steve Martin's career has evolved in that he has become a sort of iconic father figure in cinema. Bonnie Hunt, a fine, quick-witted comedienne, matches Martin in sharpness and timing. They have this easy rapport, and I believe them as a married couple. Piper Perabo plays the oldest sibling, Nora, who craves a life of her own but keeps getting dragged back into the crazy goings-on in the Baker household. Tom Welling is the discontented oldest son. Hilary Duff turns in a good performance as the even-keeled fashionista of the clan. Ashton Kutcher, back when he was up and coming, has a hilarious cameo as Perabo's self-involved model/actor. Poor Ashton Kutcher.But it's the kids, with their personal oddities, who lend a refreshing spikiness to the story. Alyson Stoner (who you may've seen in those Missy Elliot music videos) is the standout as the tomboy ringleader Sarah, mastermind of some of the most diabolical pranks ever put to film (the meat-soaking prank is quite excellent). But it's young Forrest Landis who plays the shy, neglected Mark - nicknamed ""FedEx"" by his siblings because they claim he was dropped off at the house as a baby - whose actions provide salvation for the quickly deteriorating Baker household. But, wait, before the expected happy ending, the Bakers fall into one wild crisis after crisis, whether it's a pet frog sabotaging breakfast, tag-team throw-up, a recurring gag involving an unstable chandelier, or the wanton destruction of a neighbor's sedate birthday bash. Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy, that mild-mannered couple, would've applied the cane by now. Back in the day, parents really put their kids on punishment.Stick around for the bloopers at the end of the movie.This movie comes in two formats: widescreen on one side, full screen on the other.

When they hear their dad wants to move to follow his dream of being a football couch. All 12 of them complain and tell him he's ruining their lives. I was curious to see how Tom Welling (Smallville) does off tv and he fits in there on screen with actors like Steve Martin. However all his character has to do is complain about how he's leaving his g/f behind. It's the younger kids that have more screen time. When the mom ""Bonnie Hunt"" leaves to promote her book, Martin is left alone with all of them.Instead of being good for him and try to understand that he's trying to make time for them and couch a team as well, they raise hell instead. They crash a kid's birthday party when they all are supposed to be grounded and then call up the mom and complain about how bad a job their dad is doing. I admit I felt bad that they were getting picked on in school and they hated it there but all act like spoiled brats. Well except for the older sister and the kid with the frog who feels like he doesn't fit in. The older sister played by Piper Parabo (Coyote Ugly) with charm is more mature and likeable though. When she and her b/f (Ashton Kutchner) agree to stay there to help out, the kids make sure they ruin that as well so the father has to do everything by himself.

Going in, I was excited to see it--I thought that, with so many talented actors, it really had to be good.  I couldn't believe the irresponsibility of the characters, though.  The parents have twelve kids, and I was expecting to find that some of the kids were adopted, but no.  In this extremely overpopulated world, each parent had enough kids to replace himself/herself six times.  The kids apparently follow their parents' example in irresponsibility, each looking out for his/her own interests and sabotaging anyone who gets in the way.  When they move, they constantly make it clear that they resent their father's attempt to enjoy his dream job.  Instead of learning to adjust to their new surroundings, as most children would, they figure that they should get going when the going gets tough.I was frustrated by the idea that, in a society where so many people have difficulty having children at all, any couple would be careless enough to have so many kids that they obviously can't even begin to handle them--and then not even consider adoption as an option.  The story of how some of the kids were conceived irritated me, and I didn't feel that that information needed to be fed to the audience.The one redeeming quality I saw in the movie was the kid with the frog (Mark Baker?).  His character was sweet, cute and likable.  This fact actually only made me dislike the other characters more, since they were either mean or apathetic toward him till the very end of the movie.  Still, that kid gave a great (and, at times, heart-wrenching) performance.For that matter, I'm not sure that any of the actors gave poor performances, and the sets were pretty cool.  I can't actually remember the music--I think there was a cover that I didn't like too well, but other than that I found it to be unoffensive.  So my only real problem is with the story, which was probably more appropriate when the book and the first movie came out than it is in a current setting.",2,I was very disappointed in this movie.,1082419200,"04 20, 2004",2004,2088,"[""'m"", 'sure', 'review', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'popular', 'feel', 'be', 'said', 'was', 'sorry', 'paid', 'see', 'movie', 'Going', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'thought', 'so', 'many', 'talented', 'actors', 'really', 'had', 'be', 'good', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'irresponsibility', 'characters', 'though', 'parents', 'have', 'twelve', 'kids', 'was', 'expecting', 'find', 'kids', 'were', 'adopted', 'extremely', 'overpopulated', 'world', 'parent', 'had', 'enough', 'kids', 'replace', 'six', 'times', 'kids', 'apparently', 'follow', 'parents', 'example', 'irresponsibility', 'looking', 'out', 'his/her', 'own', 'interests', 'sabotaging', 'anyone', 'who', 'way', 'When', 'move', 'constantly', 'make', 'clear', 'resent', 'father', 'attempt', 'enjoy', 'dream', 'job', 'Instead', 'learning', 'adjust', 'new', 'surroundings', 'most', 'children', 'would', 'figure', 'should', 'get', 'going', 'when', 'going', 'tough.I', 'was', 'frustrated', 'idea', 'society', 'where', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'difficulty', 'having', 'children', 'couple', 'would', 'be', 'careless', 'enough', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'kids', 'obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'handle', 'then', 'not', 'even', 'consider', 'adoption', 'option', 'story', 'how', 'kids', 'were', 'conceived', 'irritated', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'information', 'needed', 'be', 'fed', 'audience.The', 'one', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'saw', 'movie', 'was', 'kid', 'frog', 'Mark', 'Baker', 'character', 'was', 'sweet', 'cute', 'likable', 'fact', 'actually', 'only', 'made', 'dislike', 'other', 'characters', 'more', 'were', 'mean', 'apathetic', 'till', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'Still', 'kid', 'gave', 'great', 'times', 'heart-wrenching', 'performance.For', 'matter', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'actors', 'gave', 'poor', 'performances', 'sets', 'were', 'pretty', 'cool', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actually', 'remember', 'music', 'think', 'was', 'cover', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'too', 'well', 'other', 'found', 'be', 'unoffensive', 'So', 'only', 'real', 'problem', 'story', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'appropriate', 'when', 'book', 'first', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'current', 'setting']",N/A

801966,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001EFTH4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 14]","I have known for some time that I am old, but watching &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; confirmed something even worse: I am a parent.I say this because when Tom Baker (Steve Martin) has the opportunity to coach at his alma mater, a Division I school that must be the other college in Evanston, Illinois besides Northwestern, his eleven children pretty much turn on him (the oldest is already in Evanston living with her boyfriend, so she does not get a vote).  All of the kids immediately start whining about losing their friends and even the prospect of finally living in a house big enough for each of them to have their own rooms (except for the last set of twins) because dad's dream job means an increase in salary by like 10 fold, does not enter into their mercenary little hearts.Life adds insult to injury for poor Tom, because just as he gets busy with his new job his wife, Kate (the wonderful Bonnie Hunt), learns that a publisher is interested in her book (entitled &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen,&quot; of course) and wants to send her on a book tour.  Kate supported Tom so he now returns the favor, although this means he is going to have to fend for himself with the eleven kids.  He really is on his own, not only because he cannot hire anybody to work in a home with twelve kids (he keeps forgetting the oldest is not living there anymore) but because without mom around this family apparently has no idea of how to function.To be fair, I have little doubt that kids are going to like this movie a lot more than adults.  They should.  Their side wins the war here.  In the end their parents, the bullies at school, the snobbish neighbors, and everybody else go down in defeat or at least beat a hasty retreat.Steve Martin tries to recapture the wonderful father figure he portrayed in &quot;Parenthood,&quot; but the problem is that it is hard to buy the football coach part of the equation in this film.  This is especially true because this is the part of the film where reality bends to the dictates of the screenplay (can you really have practice in your house and back yard for any sort of football team let along one from a major college?).  Bonnie Hunt is perfect, which pretty much explains why her character is sent off to a sideshow for a large segment of the film, otherwise the plot would not spin so far out of control.There is a clear line of demarcation with the kids.  The three oldest are all recognizable faces, with Piper Perabo from &quot;Coyote Ugly,&quot; Tom Welling from television's &quot;Smallville,&quot; and Hillary Duff from everything having to do with her Lizzie McGuire character.  The other nine are all fresh faces and they are the ones who come out best in this film.  The three young &quot;stars&quot; are all plagued by plotlines that really do not go anywhere.  Perabo's Nora violates a major rule of her parent's home with only one slight ripple.  Welling's Charlie is subjected to prejudice and stupidity at his new school (what football coach looks at a guy and decides what position he plays?) without the expected chance to get back a little of his own.  At least the younger kids get to do that at their school.  Then there is Duff's Lorraine who basically runs around the movie without ever finding a plot line to call her own.  Of course with thirteen other members of the family to contend with, and Nora's boyfriend, the uncredited Ashton Kutcher, competition for screen time is fierce.The funniest moment in this 2003 film would have to be when Martin and Hunt are trying to pull the family dog off of Kutcher's rear end.  I know I should be think of them in terms of their characters by that point in the film, but it was really hard to get past the idea of what the script has these three stars doing in that scene.  But despite the funny moments, which almost always come from slapstick rather than character, this is an emotionally unsatisfying film.  When a crisis finally forces the Baker family to come together, it is really too little too late as far as I am concerned.Besides, look at what happens at the end of the film where nobody in the Baker family gets what they want having given it up at different points earlier in the film.  The main losers remain the parents, who got a taste of the good life but are forced to give it up.  Nor do the kids get to go back to the town of their happy youth.  &quot;Close&quot; works with horseshoes, hand grenades, and thermonuclear devices, but not with finding a job and moving a town in proximity to the place you left a year earlier.For me the final note of &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; is rather depressing.

801972,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B0001EFTH4,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[6, 9]","On the positive side, this movie is a decent family movie that provides a few laughs.  The chaos of having 13 people and assorted critters, and occasionally more people when daughter Nora and her clueless boyfriend return home, provide numerous opportunities for relatively wholesome laughs.  This movie actually has a Disney feel to it given how family oriented it is, both in the plot and in its style.  On the down side, this movie seems to have little relation to the superb 1950 movie starring Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy, which offered a much closer view to the book by the Gilbreth children Frank B. Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey.Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt play Tom Baker and Kate Baker.  Tom is a high school coach whose dream was to coach for his college team.  Kate was a Chicago newspaper reporter who has dreamed of writing a book (""Cheaper by the Dozen,"" surprise).  When the opportunity comes to coach the Stallions in the Chicago metropolitan area (a far north suburb, it appears), Tom and Kate decide to take the opportunity.  The children, on the other hand, decide they would rather be back in the country.The comedy from this movie comes from the constant chaos in the family and the contrast between a large family accustomed to a rural life and their supposedly more sophisticated urban neighbors.  Unfortunately, for adult viewers and most teen viewers, much of the comedy is predictable.  As one example, when the pet frog escapes you can predict the mayhem that will ensue, and you can even predict aspects of that mayhem.  There are some utter implausibilities as part of the mayhem that are not for those with any mind for physics, just for the laughs.While this movie offers a decent mental break (meaning you do not have to think, and perhaps it is preferred that you not think while watching the movie), and it is good family fair (no bad language, sex outside of marriage is discouraged, family life is good, etc.), beyond that the movie plays up too many stereotypes.  Rural families are hicks and uninformed.  Urban dwellers all act cool and have fancy cars.  Big families are chaotic.  Sorry, but as anyone who has lived in more than two places can attest, or has been a member of a larger family, the stereotypes may be funny, but they are generally untrue.  However, the basis on these cultural inaccuracies matches the lack of accuracy relative to the original story, so if you like and consider this to be a slapstick comedy based on parody, it might work for you.

Tom (Steve Martin) was an only child and Kate (Bonnie Hunt) was from a large family, herself.  But things went a little further then they had planned.  Still, they and their kids are mostly happy, even if life is chaotic.But then things change.  Tom is offered his dream job, coaching football for his alma mater.  And Kate's book about their life actually gets published, leading to a national book tour.At first, everyone is happy by the changes.  There's more money and more space in their bigger house.  But slowly the kids realize that the parents don't have time for them any more.  Can they get their parents' attention?I saw the original movie years ago and remember enjoying it (except for the ending).  I was always curious to see this film.  It wasn't exactly worth it.  With so many characters, it's hard to get to know anyone, although I did empathize with Mark Baker right off the bat for some reason.  Even the big name stars brought in for the older kids (Tom Welling and Hilary Duff) get lost in the shuffle.Furthermore, the plot doesn't really take advantage of the multiple kids idea.  True, there are some comic moments, but much of this movie could have been done with 4 kids and gotten the same point across.  Now don't get me wrong, I like the moral of the movie.  I just think this film could have done better.If you've got nothing else to do, this movie will kill 98 minutes.  There are worse ways to spend your time.

I can not disagree with any observations that have already been made.  After seeing this DVD and reading the reviews, one thing is clear to me: if you make a movie with flaws, people will notice it.  Considering how many bad movies come out in theatres these days, this is definitely a revelation.It is true, the movie is cliche and underuses the talents of Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt.  It is also true that in today's modern world having 12 kids of your own without thinking of adoption is more than a bit selfish.  But like it or not, there are people in this country who still believe in the virtues of having enough kids for their own football team.  Should that have been made into a comedy for adults?  No, certainly not.But the thing that strikes me about this movie is that it was made for kids, not adults.  Kids can relate to this family because with 12 of them every kid is bound to relate to one of them.  The prissy teenage girl in Hillary Duff, the younger neglected child.  Yes it's a bad movie.  But don't be surprised if your kids ask you to put this torture in the DVD every weekend when their cousins come over.The silly antics in this movie are a part of that too.  The snake getting loose at the birthday party.  Who didn't see that coming?It's a shame that so many of us were roped into this one because Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt have their names on it.  But that's how film-makers make money, by trying to appeal to both parents and children.  For those who love these actors and want a great movie, this isn't it.

She's been wanting to see it ever since it came out at the cinema, but with her busy social life, we never went to see it. And on (...) spending spree in a DVD store (for me it's a DVD store, I go straight past the CDs) I managed to get this too. So she was very happy, although it's in my DVD case, not hers!The only quibbles I have about this movie is that Piper Perabo didn't appear enough in it (she's great in Coyote Ugly), and are we really supposed to believe that Bonnie Hunt's character is supposed to have given birth to twelve babies?! Come on, she'd be run ragged, and certainly not looking as good as she is! And the only two of the kids (apart from Piper Perabo) are well-known are Hilary Duff & Tom Welling and they're just thrown in there for the younger viewers.I'm an only child, and have been a loner most of my life, I'm even a loner now as a 20-something. It looks very unlikely I'll have nieces & nephews, plus, I probably couldn't keep track of their birthdays! I doubt I'd want a big family after the way I've grown up, but watching this makes me long for or thank god that I'd never grown up in that kinda environment! It would have been nice though. But then again, you could also look on the fact it wouldn't have made me the way I am now.The kids are:Piper Perabo, the oldest daughter, who doesn't have to suffer from the overcrowding of her family, but does have to suffer with Hank a vain actor boyfriend, played by Ashton Kutcher. (Who's surprisingly good in this, and some of his Punk'd pals appear as Oprah's TV crew)Hilary Duff doesn't try to be anything else, but the various characters she's played in the past. Cute fringe though. (I miss mine) For all you Hilary Duff haters, she isn't the main focus of the movie, so aside from a few bratty moments, she's not in it that much. But she gets one of her songs over the end credits I think.Tom Welling as the oldest son and hates his father as much as he hates being in a big family, and being moved to a new school where all the snot-nosed kids insult him, and he misses his girlfriend. Diddums.Forrest Landis is FedEx, the nerdy outcast of the family who ends up sleeping in a cool room with a secret escape/disposal hatch, who wouldn't want to sleep there?!Alyson Stoner is brilliant as the team leader of the group really. Whether it's plotting against babysitters and dipping Hank's underwear in meat, this girl is the coolest of the 12 Baker kids.I wasn't all that keen on the ending. It didn't seem to belong to the rest of the movie, and instead was just tacked on at the end to please whoever it was, the studio or someone. The kids don't apologize for being brats and it ends with the father and mother giving up their dreams and the kids getting their own way.The extras are your bog-standard usual: commentary by director Shawn (nice name) Levy; commentary by the Baker Kids; deleted/extended scenes with optional commentary; and ""Director's Viewfinder: Creating a Fictional Family"" - featurette. One thing I will say about the extras are the deleted/extended scenes are very cool. Normally you can watch these with or without the commentary without? I'm normally one of these people who likes to watch the deleted scenes (sometimes they're quite good!) with no commentary, and watching them afterwards with the commentary can get a bit tedious. But on this, Shawn Levy's comments are in text, so you can watch the scenes without hearing his voice.

Martin is highly likeable as a small town football coach who is offered the opportunity to move to Chicago to coach a major college football team.  This opportunity is too good to pass up and since it is what Martin has wanted his whole life.  The bad thing is that his large family, that is used to living the small-town lifestyle is forced to uproot and move to a totally alien environment in a rapid-paced big city.Martin's professional life clashes with his personal life, as his university boss wants him to spend all his waking hours concentrating on football, while his twelve children are all running into problems adjusting to the new environment and constantly need his attention.  His problems get multiplied when his wife's career as a writer takes off and she is asked to go on a tour to promote her book, leaving Martin to be in charge of the 12 demanding children.It is highly entertaining seeing how Martin tries to have his football team practice at his house so he can also watch his kids.

It's like making a version of a movie titled ""The Sound of Music"" that was about a family that sings, only in the new version they play in a rock band, the story would be set in the hills of Hollywood, and Maria is now a retired CIA agent named Kaitlyn who became a personal bodyguard to a family named the Winklemans.  People would be singing, and they would be a family, but that would be where the similarities ended.So, okay, that's enough for my disappointment that this was not an updated take on the Gilbreth family.  But even laying that disappointment aside, this movie still offers so much to hate:-- Please, let Steve Martin stop making movies where he plays either the Family Man Clown or the Sad Clown.  Neither is very appealing.-- Both parents in the Baker family depicted in this movie are profoundly selfish, each vying for personal glory with high-stakes careers, each paying lip service to the idea of supporting one another's dreams, each ignoring their existing obligations to their many children, and each quickly blaming the other when things blow up in their faces.-- The eldest daughter, Nora, no longer lives at home, and wasted no time in disregarding her upbringing and her parent's wishes when she chose to shack up with a man.  That her cohabitation with him ends not because she has a moral epiphany but because she realizes he's a jerk is hardly a satisfying conclusion, and certainly not a family-friendly message.-- Lastly, the ""zany"" outtakes at the end include making a joke about an incestuous kiss between mother and son when we see Kate Baker making out with her teenage son, Charlie.

801990,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B0001EFTH4,P. Hardy,"[0, 2]","Anyone who has seen in this movie - immediately knows what's going to happen. This movie will only please ""Parent-spitng"" children/teens (directly influenced by today's world and television programs) and Tom Wwelling/Smallville - Ashton Kutcher/Punk'd - and Hillary Duff/Lizzie Maguire fans all across the world. I've must've seen this movie more than once with my family and after a while, the movie really looses what little funny moments it had to begin with. The plot is really simplistic; Steve Martin's character, the father of a dozen children gets a rise in and is given the chance to take his dream job as well as get a raise in his paycheck for the good of the family, with the promise of being ""a tighter family,"" thus automatically labeling him with the sticker of the ""villain"" of the story when this promise isn't fulfilled. The children are enraged and upset with the fact that they will be forced to move away from their home since diapers no matter what their opinion is. Tom Welling's character's is basically the same as Smallville's version of ""Clark Kent"", only he has a girlfriend this time. Hillary Duff's character really has no excuse to stay in her hometown other than her ""all her best friends are here."" So when they move from milldleton into a more fancy community full of the richest people in the fanciest houses money can buy, you know from the start the children will not love their not situation or the fact that they're father does not seem to care that they don't.The mother has a partial role in this family apparently. She is thrown out of the picture until the end of the movie. This is to justify the kids animosity toward their father. I know your just supposed to watch this movie with little expectation, to at least have fun watching every scene unfold, but how far can a movie feeding off ""the kids are right, the parents are wrong"" syndrome, last? The only funny moments in ""Cheaper By the Dozen"" are when Kutcher gets bit on the backside by their Dog (his name escapes me) and when Welling's character's locker is stuffed with corn and it comes falling out. However, that's just taking a bit too much from ""Poor Clark/alienation"" syndrome of Smallville.Once the children go beyond out of hand, the father finally decides to crack the whip on them and hand on punishments the children seem to have no familiarity with. And when the mother comes home they only get worse afterward. The rest of the movie is pretty predicable. There is basically no reason for Duff, Welling, or Kutcher's presnce to be in the movie other than to draw the slected audience toward watching the movie. The slected would be actor's screen time is so little  that the younger children carry the movie all one their own without their help. Steve Martin and Hunt are just the backdrop for the kids. Steven Martin's best role was ""Leap of faith."" His character was funny and sarcastic. Quite likable despite his con-man status. The father of this movie was not funny, much like the movie itself. So what reasons do I have to dislike ""Cheaper by the dozen""? See above and see my ""Everwood"" review.

The way that the cameramen decided not to do it as the kids got out of control and arguing. I thought the movie was quite good.  Although Steve Martin was funnier in Bringin' Down the House, the movie still shows him as a stronger actor this time in both funny and dramatic scenes. Helen Hunt made a good mother in this movie as she is the calmer side to the kids.  The kids were good, although a few of them need to get better on their acting. But I don't know if anyone else should make a movie on parents raising 12 children. Steve seemed lost in a few scenes as the kids create havoc all over the house. That hanging glass light that Wayne from Seinfeld was installing fell and broke about THREE TIMES in that movie! Made me think that it was really happening on purpose and somebody could have been seriously hurt. The oldest daughter and her boyfriend look like they are stuck in the '80s. Ashton Kutcher is that funny in his scenes; seems so obsessed with his TV commercial. Hilary Duff seemed questionable here.  Is she riding on that rock star image that she does on her current 2nd album? She seems detached from the other kids. That snake which got loose at the kids' friend's party was so funny and scary at the same time. And I would have liked more scenes with the father and the oldest son, who becomes a little rebellious with his dad when he got kicked off the football team. The son wants to have his own independence, which is all too soon. He should have apologized for talking back to his father like that--it was so insulting. The one boy who wanted to move back to Midland made his point when he went on the train. He just didn't like living in Chicago. And I don't think that Mr. Baker could adjust to being a coach despite the demands of coaching a team and handling 12 kids. And the best thing, that Mrs. Baker's book still ended up on the best-sellers list despite cutting short her national book tour to be with her kids. Although it's a remake of a 1950 movie, the producers probably wanted to appeal to the modern, Internet crowd and families who multitask a lot these days. Trust me, it's hard to catch some busy families these days and put them in one place at one time.

Along the way there are several intended-to-be-humorous set pieces and a whole host of cathartic morals to be enjoyed.The problem with this sort of movie is that families just ain't the way they used to be. Long-gone are the days when Mom stayed at home with the kids and Dad went out a-hunting for his salary, and 'family' movies need to reflect this trend if they're going to be successful. Sadly this is not the case with 'Cheaper By The Dozen' and the picture suffers from a severe case of 'Old-Fashionedness' - but not in an endearing or humourous way. Quite the opposite, in fact - the gross sexism and heavy-handed morals of the Baker clan will have many switching off in testy semi-outrage long before the film is complete.Performance-wise there's not much here to keep one watching, either - save for a truly atrocious Ashton Kutcher cameo that really forces home the point that the Kid really does have no talent whatsoever. And Martin's tried-and-trusted Harangued Father schtick really should have been left in the Eighties, where it belongs.The Kids themselves are little more than a rowdy ensemble of mismatched stereotypes, with neither development nor reason for their apparent 'personalities'.Not even recommended for lazy Sunday afternoon viewing, check out Martin classics like 'Parenthood' and 'The Man With Two Brains' for examples of his once-deserved fame, or family gems like 'Finding Nemo' and 'Shrek' if it's something you'd like to watch with the Kids.",2,Zero to Hero to Zero; and the circle is complete.,1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,2159,"['Poor', 'Steve', 'Martin.How', 'awful', 'must', 'be', 'know', 'were', 'once', 'power', 'Hollywood', 'comedic', 'actor', 'par', 'excellence', 'timing', 'talent', 'reputation', 'now', ""'re"", 'little', 'more', 'character', 'actor', 'flying', 'ever-faster', 'towards', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Bargain', 'Bin', 'Has-Beens.Steve', 'Martin', 'shudder', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'who', 'really', 'ought', 'be', 'more', 'pictures', 'typecast', 'now', 'decent', 'nonetheless', 'star', 'here', 'pair', 'overly-affectionate', 'parents', 'who', 'having', 'family', 'twelve', 'decide', 'boost', 'careers', 'bank', 'balances', 'accepting', 'job', 'promotions', 'PR', 'work', 'resulting', 'upheaval', 'family', 'subsequent', 're-examination', 'family', 'values', 'way', 'are', 'several', 'intended-to-be-humorous', 'set', 'pieces', 'whole', 'host', 'cathartic', 'morals', 'be', 'enjoyed.The', 'problem', 'sort', 'movie', 'families', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'way', 'used', 'be', 'Long-gone', 'are', 'days', 'when', 'Mom', 'stayed', 'home', 'kids', 'Dad', 'went', 'out', 'a-hunting', 'salary', ""'family"", 'movies', 'need', 'reflect', 'trend', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'successful', 'Sadly', 'not', 'case', ""'Cheaper"", 'Dozen', 'picture', 'suffers', 'severe', 'case', ""'Old-Fashionedness"", 'not', 'endearing', 'humourous', 'way', 'opposite', 'fact', 'gross', 'sexism', 'heavy-handed', 'morals', 'Baker', 'clan', 'will', 'have', 'many', 'switching', 'off', 'testy', 'semi-outrage', 'long', 'film', 'complete.Performance-wise', 'not', 'much', 'here', 'keep', 'one', 'watching', 'save', 'truly', 'atrocious', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'cameo', 'really', 'home', 'point', 'Kid', 'really', 'have', 'talent', 'whatsoever', 'Martin', 'tried-and-trusted', 'Harangued', 'Father', 'schtick', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'Eighties', 'where', 'Kids', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'rowdy', 'ensemble', 'mismatched', 'stereotypes', 'development', 'reason', 'apparent', 'even', 'recommended', 'lazy', 'Sunday', 'afternoon', 'viewing', 'check', 'out', 'Martin', 'classics', ""'Parenthood"", 'Man', 'Two', 'Brains', 'examples', 'once-deserved', 'fame', 'family', 'gems', ""'Finding"", 'Nemo', 'something', ""'d"", 'like', 'watch', 'Kids']",N/A

I then procceded to vertually rewatch the film to death, as I did with almost every movie my family owned. After not viewing this movie for about four years, I ended up watching this again and I began to appreciate what this movie wanted to do.I finally began to see how deep the movie was trying to be, how hard it was to give 12 kids (really 10) different personalities and ages and still carry a sense of family between them and how hard it is to have both a comedy and a family flim without screwing one element up. I feel the movie does all of this very well.I began to really enjoy all the characters again, and having been through some of their personalities or problems (mark being bullied and alone, kim and jessica talking too much like a smart alike and about themselves, Charlie feeling as if his life was ruined by someone's elses plans, Nora having problems with finding balance with her own problems and family issues) I feel for them a lot more. And one of the overall messages of the movie, finding the right balance between family and what you want is a good one.The humor still remains funny, but mainly because the situation is only possible in a movie/family like this. Also knowing some of the celebrities of this movie was nice to see. And I was impressed by how easily Ashton Keutcher played a really self obsessed guy. Although I'll admit he does seem to get people's emotions off the charts easily anyway.And of course Steve Martin, he did great as a caring, more serious, but fun father.

801997,A1FPFWDC1ASYNJ,B0001EFTH4,Rodrigo Llamozas,"[7, 9]","After watching movies like Cheaper by the dozen, I not only question my taste in movies, but also my sense of belonging to my group of friends. Everyone we knew had seen it, and they all had loved it. Expressions like&quot;go see it, it's hilarious&quot; or &quot;it's SO funny!&quot; were usually uttered by our friends. For some reason we had managed to miss this film altogether, having something happen everytime we intended to see it. We even had tickets for a premiere of the film, but we managed to miss that too. To add to the list, the movie made more money than The Matrix Revolutions (which wasn't that good a movie either, but, come on!). Of course, after all these thing really helped create high expectations for this film...I went in with a little bit of apprehension, because Martin's previous film was the atrocious Bringing down the house (with Queen Latifah) and the trailer didn't really help. Unfortunately, my fears were proven right. The film was really, REALLY bad. How can a film so highly recommended and with such high grosses ($138MM in the U.S. and Canada alone) be this bad? Even more disturbing, how can a film so awful be so successful? Beats me.A remake of sorts of the 1950 film starring Myrna Loy and Clifton Webb, Cheaper by the dozen narrates the supposedly funny misadventures of two parents of twelve kids who move from their little town into Chicago once the father (Martin) gets his dream job as head coach of his alma mater's football team. Of course, the kids are not happy with leaving their home, and to make matters worse, once they're in the big city, the father is swamped with work and the mother (Hunt) has her book (about raising a dozen kids, no less) published and is forced to go on a publicity tour. Who will take care of the kids? How can two working parents handle twelve children without help? Wackiness is supposed to ensue, but in all honesty, I found very little of it to be funny.Martin's performance is one of his worse (not that his that much of an actor to begin with), Hunt has very little to do, except miss her kids while she's away. But that's not the bad part of the movie, both actors are good enough for the material they're given. The real negative was the writing and the casting of the kids. These characters should be the hook to make a connection with the audience, instead, they're the reason that that connection isn't made.The kids are obnoxious brats who turn out to be mean and spoiled and don't care that much for their hard working parents. They didn't agree with moving, they didn't like their new school, they don't help around the house, they don't support their dad's new job, they basically destroy the house they live in, they're mean to each other. You get the picture.As for the kids playing the 'dirty dozen', there's Coyote Ugly alumni Piper Perabo as the eldest daughter, who shows for all of five minutes and has nothing really to do, Smalville's Tom Welling as the oldest son, whose constantly irritated (and irritating) at his father (he has a girlfriend back home, see, with whom he is in love and his mean parents made him move away from her, see) - this little 'drama' goes nowhere in the film. There's also teen, er, sensation Hilary Duff as a fashion obsessed young lady who needs to use the bathroom three minutes longer than the rest of the family because she needs to put on her make-up. The rest of the kids are played by unknowns or mostly unknowns. There's the tomboy, there's the geeky one that the rest step all over of, there's the fat 'witty' one, there's the opinionated twin girls and the infant cute twin boys. I'm missing a couple of kids, I'm sure, but that goes to show you how irrelevant their personalities were.Obviously, at the end all the kids show their love and support for their dad because, you know, all the bratty attitudes and temper tantrums really mean nothing. We destroy you house and your life because we love you, mom and dad.The only bright spot of the film comes from an uncredited appearance by That 70's show's Ashton Kutchner, who steals the show (for however few minutes he has) as Perabo's actor boyfriend. His scenes at the table with the rest of the family and the attack by the family's dog are quite funny. Unfortunately, he has very few scenes in the film.As for the writing...Joel Cohen wrote Toy story, so that should mean there's some quality here, right? Wrong! He also wrote Garfield: The movie (also known as Garfield: The train wreck) and the upcoming Eddie Murphy family sequel Daddy day camp which he co-wrote with Sokolow.I don't know what happened with this film. Is is really that bad? Am I being too harsh? Is the rest of the world wrong or should I go get my head checked? I don't know the answers to these questions, all I know is that I thought Cheaper by the dozen to be an awful film and a waste of my money.Why Steve Martin, why?----After finishing my review and re-reading it, I think I come out as a Steve Martin hater, which is not the case. To put things in perspective, I own both Dead men don't wear plaid and The man with two brains on DVD. I love Roxanne to death. The jerk is truly a gem of American comedy. His stints as guest host on SNL rank with the best of them. I used to be able to quote The three amigos almos verbatim. I think My blue heaven to be an underrated and misunderstood little film. But still...why Steve Martin, why? First Bringing down the house, then this and next a remake of The pink panther?

801998,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001EFTH4,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 5]","""Cheaper By the Dozen,"" with its ostensibly comic portrayal of a seriously overextended family, could almost be a recruiting poster for Planned Parenthood, so unnerving is its vision of domestic bliss.  Here is a movie about family life that makes ""The Brady Bunch"" look like ""Ordinary People"" in comparison.  In this remake of the 1950 film of the same name, Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt play Tom and Kate Baker, the proud parents of twelve - count `em, twelve! - unruly children.  One of the principal problems with this updated version, which like the earlier film is based on a true-life account of an actual family, is that the very premise doesn't sit well with the realities of a modern world.  The idea of a couple indulging in unbridled reproduction may have struck the parents of the Baby Boomer Generation as clever, quaint and fall-down-laughing funny in its time, but in our currently overpopulated world of diminishing resources, Tom and Kate appear merely irresponsible and arrogant to us today.  Heck, at least the elephantine brood in ""Yours, Mine and Ours"" was the product of two already established families coming together as one.  All throughout ""Cheaper by the Dozen,"" our enjoyment is plagued by that nasty little voice of reason that keeps whispering in our ear that if these two people had exercised even a modicum of restraint in the birth control department, they wouldn't be facing the chaotic situation they have on their hands now (Tom's vasectomy obviously came too late to be of any help).And chaotic it is.  The kids - whose ages range from early twenties to preschool - spend most of their time running wildly around the house, playing hockey on the stairs, knocking things over, swinging dangerously from chandeliers, throwing up in the kitchen, and devising nasty pranks to pull on their oldest sister's boyfriend, played by a hapless Ashton Kutcher, who, wisely and understandably, passed up being listed in the credits for his contribution here.  Given the chance, director Shawn Levy and four (!) credited writers aim for the lowest common denominator laugh every time, employing the kind of weary plot set-ups and tired slapstick routines that have been done to death by countless lame-brained TV sitcoms.  The filmmakers also seem to have an inordinate fondness for crotch-centered jokes, an obsession of questionable appropriateness given the ""family-friendly"" nature of the film.  Martin, one of the finest comic actors of his generation, has been reduced to endless mugging, playing the stereotypical incompetent dad who finds he has no control over his progeny the moment his wife gets called out of town (she is forced to leave him alone with the kids while she goes off to New York on a tour to promote the book she wrote about their family).  Yet, even though the kids behave like little hellions most of the time, the family members get along splendidly, with nary a disagreement among any of the children or a cross word from either parent.  Of course, all is not fun and games in the story department, for the writers take an occasional time out from the bedlam to provide moments of sappy moralizing and saccharine sentimentality.  These aren't funny either, but then again, they aren't trying to be.  What's the excuse for the rest of the film?Personally, when it comes to a comic portrayal of American family life, I think I'll stick with ""Roseanne.""",2,banal feature length sitcom,1092873600,"08 19, 2004",2004,3404,"['Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'ostensibly', 'comic', 'portrayal', 'seriously', 'overextended', 'family', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'recruiting', 'poster', 'Planned', 'Parenthood', 'unnerving', 'vision', 'domestic', 'bliss', 'Here', 'movie', 'family', 'life', 'Brady', 'Bunch', 'look', 'Ordinary', 'People', 'comparison', 'remake', '1950', 'film', 'same', 'name', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'play', 'Tom', 'Kate', 'Baker', 'proud', 'parents', 'twelve', 'count', 'em', 'twelve', 'unruly', 'children', 'One', 'principal', 'problems', 'updated', 'version', 'earlier', 'film', 'based', 'true-life', 'account', 'actual', 'family', 'very', 'premise', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'realities', 'modern', 'world', 'idea', 'couple', 'indulging', 'unbridled', 'reproduction', 'may', 'have', 'struck', 'parents', 'Baby', 'Boomer', 'Generation', 'clever', 'quaint', 'fall-down-laughing', 'funny', 'time', 'currently', 'overpopulated', 'world', 'diminishing', 'resources', 'Tom', 'Kate', 'appear', 'merely', 'irresponsible', 'arrogant', 'today', 'Heck', 'least', 'elephantine', 'brood', 'Yours', 'Mine', 'Ours', 'was', 'product', 'two', 'already', 'established', 'families', 'coming', 'together', 'one', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'enjoyment', 'plagued', 'nasty', 'little', 'voice', 'reason', 'whispering', 'ear', 'two', 'people', 'had', 'exercised', 'even', 'modicum', 'restraint', 'birth', 'control', 'department', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'facing', 'chaotic', 'situation', 'have', 'hands', 'now', 'Tom', 'vasectomy', 'obviously', 'came', 'too', 'late', 'be', 'help', 'chaotic', 'kids', 'ages', 'range', 'early', 'twenties', 'preschool', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'running', 'wildly', 'house', 'playing', 'hockey', 'stairs', 'knocking', 'things', 'swinging', 'dangerously', 'chandeliers', 'throwing', 'up', 'kitchen', 'devising', 'nasty', 'pranks', 'pull', 'oldest', 'sister', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'hapless', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'who', 'wisely', 'understandably', 'passed', 'up', 'being', 'listed', 'credits', 'contribution', 'here', 'Given', 'chance', 'director', 'Shawn', 'Levy', 'four', 'credited', 'writers', 'aim', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'time', 'employing', 'kind', 'weary', 'plot', 'set-ups', 'tired', 'slapstick', 'routines', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'death', 'countless', 'lame-brained', 'TV', 'sitcoms', 'filmmakers', 'also', 'seem', 'have', 'inordinate', 'fondness', 'crotch-centered', 'jokes', 'obsession', 'questionable', 'appropriateness', 'given', 'family-friendly', 'nature', 'film', 'Martin', 'one', 'finest', 'comic', 'actors', 'generation', 'been', 'reduced', 'endless', 'mugging', 'playing', 'stereotypical', 'incompetent', 'dad', 'who', 'control', 'progeny', 'moment', 'wife', 'called', 'town', 'forced', 'leave', 'alone', 'kids', 'off', 'New', 'York', 'tour', 'promote', 'book', 'wrote', 'family', 'even', 'kids', 'behave', 'like', 'little', 'hellions', 'most', 'time', 'family', 'members', 'get', 'along', 'splendidly', 'disagreement', 'children', 'cross', 'word', 'parent', 'course', 'not', 'fun', 'games', 'story', 'department', 'writers', 'take', 'occasional', 'time', 'bedlam', 'provide', 'moments', 'sappy', 'moralizing', 'saccharine', 'sentimentality', 'are', ""n't"", 'funny', 'either', 'then', 'again', 'are', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'What', 'excuse', 'rest', 'film', 'Personally', 'when', 'comic', 'portrayal', 'American', 'family', 'life', 'think', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'Roseanne']",N/A

802013,A2HW4GC6H0L2LR,B0001EFTH4,"T. George ""anne-with-an-e""","[0, 0]","I saw this movie recently on the flight back from England.  I was a captive and willing audience, and I enjoyed the light entertainment it provided.  However, if it weren't for some occasional (and minor) twists from the expected, I don't think I would have much to write about.First, for those who don't know, the premise of the movie is that two young go-getters - Tom (Steve Martin) and Kate (Bonnie Hunt)- met in college in Chicago and decided to team up together for life.  He wanted to be a coach, she wanted to be a sports journalist, and both wanted 8 kids.  As things moved along, they had 12 kids, moved to the country, and she stayed at home with the family.  As the main story opens up, you find two competent, content and even cheerful parents using assembly line strategies and doses of personal attention to raise this lively brood.Quickly things change for this overwhelming family, however, as Tom receives his dream job offer and Kate is finally getting her book ('Cheaper By the Dozen') published.  Thus, the family up and moves to Chicago (Evanston really), Tom starts the new high-profile job while Kate is asked to go on a publicity tour for her book.  And this tour includes the likes of Regis & Kelly along with Oprah (one example of the fantasy elements of the film).  Will they be able to keep things together with all this new added pressure?There is nothing suspenseful or surprising about the outcome.  It's a feel-good movie, and it leaves you feeling good, mostly.  The predictable disaster-scenarios were a bit much for me, and I would have rather had a bit more time developing some of the kids a bit more.Things I thought noteworthy were:- The number of well-known faces on the cast.  You have everyone from Steve Martin to Hillary Duff.- Martin and Hunt particularly shine in this.  It was a nice break to have chipper, generous and loving parents, and the Martin/Hunt team filled these roles admirably.  With all the parenting movies of the past, I've come to expect stressed out parents with no time, energy, or inclination to enjoy their children, their spouses or their jobs.- Ashton Kutcher made possibly his most honest statement. He says something like, 'I know I'm not that good an actor.  I get my jobs based on my face.'  Clearly this is a parody on actors, but as Kutcher's acting reputation is questionable, I was surprised he was scripted to do this (unless someone there had a mean sense of humor).- There were so many kids in the 10 year old range, it was really hard to keep track of them.  However, they put the spotlight on the mastermind Sarah Baker, and that little girl really acted out her role brilliantly.- I was pleasantly surprised that the Bakers wanted a G-rated household and frowned upon their 22 year old daughter's sleeping with her boyfriend (Kutcher).  It seemed quite the reverse of every TV show & film nonchalantly accepting this trend.- Finally, this is just a technicality from a Chicago area person, but why did they go so far as to put Tom in a big coaching job in Evanston, IL and then call the team the Stallions rather than the Northwestern Wildcats?  There were a number of other odd mixtures of reality with unreality that I had to swallow, ultimately realizing that the movie was purely about temporal entertainment.",4,"Almost 3 Stars for Predictability, But It Redeems Itself",1081987200,"04 15, 2004",2004,3298,"['saw', 'movie', 'recently', 'flight', 'back', 'England', 'was', 'captive', 'willing', 'audience', 'enjoyed', 'light', 'entertainment', 'provided', 'However', 'were', ""n't"", 'occasional', 'minor', 'expected', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'much', 'write', 'about.First', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'premise', 'movie', 'two', 'young', 'go-getters', 'Tom', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Kate', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'met', 'college', 'Chicago', 'decided', 'team', 'up', 'together', 'life', 'wanted', 'be', 'coach', 'wanted', 'be', 'sports', 'journalist', 'wanted', '8', 'kids', 'things', 'moved', 'along', 'had', '12', 'kids', 'moved', 'country', 'stayed', 'home', 'family', 'main', 'story', 'up', 'find', 'two', 'competent', 'content', 'even', 'cheerful', 'parents', 'using', 'assembly', 'line', 'strategies', 'doses', 'personal', 'attention', 'raise', 'lively', 'brood.Quickly', 'things', 'change', 'overwhelming', 'family', 'however', 'Tom', 'dream', 'job', 'offer', 'Kate', 'finally', 'getting', 'book', ""'Cheaper"", 'Dozen', 'published', 'Thus', 'family', 'up', 'moves', 'Chicago', 'Evanston', 'really', 'Tom', 'new', 'high-profile', 'job', 'Kate', 'asked', 'go', 'publicity', 'tour', 'book', 'tour', 'likes', 'Regis', 'Kelly', 'Oprah', 'one', 'example', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'film', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'things', 'together', 'new', 'added', 'pressure', 'nothing', 'suspenseful', 'surprising', 'outcome', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'feeling', 'good', 'mostly', 'predictable', 'disaster-scenarios', 'were', 'bit', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'had', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'developing', 'kids', 'bit', 'more.Things', 'thought', 'noteworthy', 'were', 'number', 'well-known', 'cast', 'have', 'everyone', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Hillary', 'Duff.-', 'Martin', 'Hunt', 'particularly', 'shine', 'was', 'nice', 'break', 'have', 'chipper', 'generous', 'loving', 'parents', 'Martin/Hunt', 'team', 'filled', 'roles', 'admirably', 'parenting', 'movies', 'past', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'stressed', 'out', 'parents', 'time', 'energy', 'inclination', 'enjoy', 'children', 'spouses', 'jobs.-', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'made', 'possibly', 'most', 'honest', 'statement', 'something', 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'that', 'good', 'actor', 'get', 'jobs', 'based', 'face', 'Clearly', 'parody', 'actors', 'Kutcher', 'acting', 'reputation', 'questionable', 'was', 'surprised', 'was', 'scripted', 'do', 'someone', 'had', 'mean', 'sense', 'humor', '.-', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'kids', '10', 'year', 'old', 'range', 'was', 'really', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'However', 'put', 'spotlight', 'mastermind', 'Sarah', 'Baker', 'little', 'girl', 'really', 'acted', 'out', 'role', 'brilliantly.-', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Bakers', 'wanted', 'G-rated', 'household', 'frowned', '22', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'sleeping', 'boyfriend', 'Kutcher', 'seemed', 'quite', 'reverse', 'TV', 'show', 'film', 'nonchalantly', 'accepting', 'trend.-', 'Finally', 'just', 'technicality', 'Chicago', 'area', 'person', 'why', 'did', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'put', 'Tom', 'big', 'coaching', 'job', 'Evanston', 'IL', 'then', 'call', 'team', 'Stallions', 'rather', 'Northwestern', 'Wildcats', 'were', 'number', 'other', 'odd', 'mixtures', 'reality', 'unreality', 'had', 'swallow', 'ultimately', 'realizing', 'movie', 'was', 'purely', 'temporal', 'entertainment']",N/A

Here are a dozen reasons why it's OK and not so OK.1) (Good) Steve Martin is perfect for these kind of roles. He remains the personification of the unflappable leading man that he's portrayed in films like ""Parenthood"" and ""Father Of The Bride.""2) (Bad) Bonnie Hunt is wasted. She comes off well, but ultimately the kids and Martin have to carry the film.3) (Good) The kids are likable, and, at times, very touching (Especially Mark/Fed Ex). None of them utter curse words or make smutty jokes.4) (Bad) That the kids frequently flagrantly disobey house rules without any kind of discipline. (Although the pants and meat gag is the film's best joke.) They plot and scheme sadistic traps ala ""Home Alone"" lite, and spend a fair amount of time saying how badly the parents' work is interfering with their lives, never minding the fact that Dad's new job is putting them into a higher standard of living then they've ever known before. (Tom Welling in particular.)5) (Good) Nice to see parents who are willing to try to live their dreams, not shut everything else out of their lives and do so without resentment towards each other.6) (Bad) Does anyone really believe you could practice a College football team in a back yard?7) (Good) Despite having twelve kids on screen (OK, so Nora, the oldest, is living on her own), each kid gets some time to chew the scenery and does so without getting overtly cute or sugary.8) (Bad) The DVD sports a serious lack of extras. Fox couldn't fit a trailer on the disc but found space to promote the upcoming ""Garfield?"" Boo and hiss.9) (Good) Ashton Kutcher playing right into type as Nora's narcissistic boyfriend.10) (Bad) I am getting really tired of all things Hillary Duff.11) (Good) Any soundtrack that features 10,000 Maniacs and Fountains of Wayne is all right by me.12) (Ultimate Good) The final messgae is that families can ultimately be happiest if they stay honest to themselves. Even in a movie as slight as ""Cheaper By The Dozen,"" it is a message that is usally ignored or, even worse, mocked by most current Hollywood fare, here it is movie's strongest core statement.

I already saw this DVD on sale for $10 at Target, not that I would remotely consider purchasing it.

Martin has starred in remakes of television shows (SGT. BILKO) and old movies (FATHER OF THE BRIDE). He has continued in that vein starring in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN, a film based off of a classic memoir from the first half of the 20th century.Steve Martin really isn't the star of CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN. Neither is Bonnie Hunt, though her character resonates more with the audience than Martin's. The stars of this film are the 12 children. Therefore, the movie is a true family comedy. It's a movie about a family with a strong message emphasizing the importance of that grand institution. The film has a little bit of something to appeal to everyone and without any of the gratuitous language, sex typical, or unneeded violence of many comedies nowadays.I was really surprised by CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN. I knew it wouldn't be like the original book and film, but thought it might be more like the off-beat BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE. Instead, the movie was a fairly honest and heart-warming film all about the importance of family. I come from a family of only four children, but we are very close.

It starts out as a feel-good family film with unrealistic perky, tidy mom caring for this huge family. Then it shifts gears into selfish mom and dad moving ahead with their careers and suddenly letting the children shift for themselves. Chaos ensues and all the children are miserable.I'm guessing the intended audience is 8 to 12 years olds who could laugh at the pratfalls, misadventures, and rebellious kids. As an adult, maybe I just can't appreciate the humor of someone slipping and falling in vomit or kids plotting and setting the disliked boyfriend up for a crotch attack by the family dog.Steve Martin has to make serious decisions about his career as a coach vs his family needs.

His last two movies, ""Bringing Down The House"" and ""Loonie Tunes: Back in Action"", had some funny parts, but overall the movies weren't that good.  In fact, I wouldn't want to see them again.  I hoped ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" would be better, but I was wrong...Based on a 1950 movie, this remake stared Steve Martin, Bonnie Hunt, Hillary Duff, Shawn Levy, and many other popular stars.  With an all star cast like that, it seemed hard to mess up, but the it messed up anyway.  A lot of the characters seemed to be miscast to the kids they were playing, with the exception of Steve Martin's oldest son in the movie.  He was acting was actually believable.The story was about a football coach who lived in the middle of no-where with his wife and 12 kids.  Then he got his dream job as a college football coach, and moved everyone to the city, where everyone had to adjust to their live in the suburbs.  Then his wife had to go away for a few weeks, and Steve Martin had to take care of all 12 kids, while having the responibilitys of head football coach at a college.  Needless to say, he couldn't handle it and problem occured.Besides from some of the people being miscast for this movie, some other problems were that it seemed like it was set in the 1950s.  The original ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" came out in 1950, but it didn't seem like they wanted to update the family that much.  An example of this:  Do you think a family with 12 kids would have that many family values?  I don't think so.  And the biggest problem for the movie was that it wasn't really that funny.
