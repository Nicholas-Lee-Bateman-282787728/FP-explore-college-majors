862139,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B000679NNM,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[3, 5]","'One Of Them' could possibly be the worst movie ever made.  It is ill conceived, poorly executed, the film quality is pathetic, and it probably has some of the most atrocious acting ever put onto celluloid.The plot revolves around some annoying kids whose car wrecks due to a locust attack(which, by the way, is never explained).  After the accident, they find themselves in the infirmary of a private boarding school inhabited by some evil people.  We know they are evil because they all wear black.  Also, a student of the school recently died under suspicious circumstances and her uncle is investigating her death.  There is no explaination as to who the evil folks at the school are, why they are evil, or what they are even doing in general.  The plot is about the thinnest I've ever had the displeasure of seeing in a film.Every actor(and I use the term actor in its loosest possible meaning)is pathetic.  Every single one of them is horrible.  There is not a single line of dialogue uttered that won't make you cringe.Since this is a horror flick(again, the term is loosely used)there is the required gore.  All the violence is pretty kindergarten, most of which is laughable.  The only decent shot in the entire film is when one of the annoying kid's eyeballs gets slashed.  Other than that two second shot, the other hour and a half is complete rubbish.'One Of Them' is just about the worst movie ever made.  Avoid it like the plauge.  This film is so bad it is not even amusing to watch and mock.  It simply irritates you to the point of breaking.  It is simply irritating and so poorly executed that it should be pulled from every shelf it is on.If you want to see a great low budget horror flick, check out 'Dead Birds' or 'Dog Soldiers' instead.",1,One Of Them Big Piles Of Crap,1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,1759,"[""'One"", 'Them', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'ill', 'conceived', 'poorly', 'executed', 'film', 'quality', 'pathetic', 'probably', 'most', 'atrocious', 'acting', 'ever', 'put', 'celluloid.The', 'plot', 'annoying', 'kids', 'car', 'wrecks', 'due', 'locust', 'attack', 'way', 'never', 'explained', 'accident', 'find', 'infirmary', 'private', 'boarding', 'school', 'inhabited', 'evil', 'people', 'know', 'are', 'evil', 'wear', 'black', 'Also', 'student', 'school', 'recently', 'died', 'suspicious', 'circumstances', 'uncle', 'investigating', 'death', 'explaination', 'who', 'evil', 'folks', 'school', 'are', 'why', 'are', 'evil', 'what', 'are', 'even', 'doing', 'general', 'plot', 'thinnest', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'displeasure', 'seeing', 'film.Every', 'actor', 'use', 'term', 'actor', 'loosest', 'possible', 'meaning', 'pathetic', 'single', 'one', 'horrible', 'not', 'single', 'line', 'dialogue', 'uttered', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'cringe.Since', 'horror', 'flick', 'again', 'term', 'loosely', 'used', 'required', 'gore', 'violence', 'pretty', 'kindergarten', 'most', 'laughable', 'only', 'decent', 'shot', 'entire', 'film', 'when', 'one', 'annoying', 'kid', 'eyeballs', 'slashed', 'Other', 'two', 'second', 'shot', 'other', 'hour', 'half', 'complete', 'rubbish', ""'One"", 'Them', 'just', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'Avoid', 'plauge', 'film', 'so', 'bad', 'not', 'even', 'amusing', 'watch', 'mock', 'simply', 'point', 'breaking', 'simply', 'irritating', 'so', 'poorly', 'executed', 'should', 'be', 'pulled', 'shelf', 'on.If', 'want', 'see', 'great', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'flick', 'check', 'out', ""'Dead"", 'Birds', 'Soldiers', 'instead']",One of Them
862140,A3I3051BZDJWGU,B000679NNM,Diane C. Howard,"[2, 2]","This is sort of between a two and a three, though closer to two. Lame-ish story, dud-head townspeople, bad-acting uncle (among other bad acting moments). Still, it had a couple of Fango-moments (not to mention a Fango panel that could have used sound enhancement). I think it was worth the rental fee, but I wouldn't buy it.The teens crash because of a mysterious plague of locusts (or maybe it's moths) during a night-time drive. Instead of raising the windows, they crash and hence come to the Marques school, which has one groundskeeper and a lot of lawn to mow, all things considered. They are told it's too far to drive them to the hospital, over 20 miles I think, but nobody really makes the connection when the groundskeeper can walk it to get auto parts.The assistant headmistress was totally unbelievable, but her false smile reminded me of a school guidance counselor or family psychologist.The end was seriously hokey and had me laughing out loud for the goofiness of it. Predictable, but hey, a laugh's a laugh.I upped the star content because there's a pretty nice piece of eye candy (Richard Crenna's son) and because it had me screaming in gross-out at what they do to one of his body parts.I don't like slasher films and don't knowningly venture into that genre. I am totally bored with the whole concept of Let's Kill All The Teenagers. So I am sure there are movies out there with more realistic stabbings, slashings and dismemberments. I haven't seen them so I can't compare.I did kind of like the implication that the school was a fortress from the time of the Conquistadores. A little different from your basic 'Based On English Gothic' style house.Don't expect fine art, but it's worth a bowl of popcorn.",3,"Had its moments, but ...",1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,1726,"['sort', 'two', 'three', 'though', 'closer', 'two', 'Lame-ish', 'story', 'dud-head', 'townspeople', 'bad-acting', 'uncle', 'other', 'bad', 'acting', 'moments', 'Still', 'had', 'couple', 'Fango-moments', 'not', 'mention', 'Fango', 'panel', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'sound', 'enhancement', 'think', 'was', 'worth', 'rental', 'fee', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'it.The', 'teens', 'crash', 'mysterious', 'plague', 'locusts', 'maybe', 'moths', 'night-time', 'drive', 'Instead', 'raising', 'windows', 'crash', 'hence', 'come', 'Marques', 'school', 'one', 'groundskeeper', 'lot', 'lawn', 'mow', 'things', 'considered', 'are', 'told', 'too', 'far', 'drive', 'hospital', '20', 'miles', 'think', 'nobody', 'really', 'connection', 'when', 'groundskeeper', 'can', 'walk', 'get', 'auto', 'parts.The', 'assistant', 'headmistress', 'was', 'totally', 'unbelievable', 'false', 'smile', 'reminded', 'school', 'guidance', 'counselor', 'family', 'psychologist.The', 'end', 'was', 'seriously', 'hokey', 'had', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'goofiness', 'Predictable', 'hey', 'laugh', 'laugh.I', 'upped', 'star', 'content', 'pretty', 'nice', 'piece', 'eye', 'candy', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'son', 'had', 'screaming', 'gross-out', 'what', 'do', 'one', 'body', 'parts.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'slasher', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'knowningly', 'venture', 'genre', 'am', 'totally', 'bored', 'whole', 'concept', 'Let', 'Kill', 'Teenagers', 'So', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'movies', 'there', 'more', 'realistic', 'stabbings', 'slashings', 'dismemberments', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare.I', 'did', 'kind', 'implication', 'school', 'was', 'fortress', 'time', 'Conquistadores', 'little', 'different', 'basic', ""'Based"", 'English', 'Gothic', 'style', 'house.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'fine', 'art', 'bowl', 'popcorn']",One of Them

This cheap, irritating and boring ""horror"" film tries to be a combination of Final Destination and the Skulls.Viewers are treated to horrible lighting and dismal video quality. The plot, such as it is, concerns a bunch of teenagers who are being hunted by other dead teenagers.

With a script that seems written by a high school creative writer and a cast of unknowns who will probably stay unknown, ONE OF THEM manages to be boring, derivative and as chilling as a can of sardines.  While trying to use gore as a diversion, the movie fails to generate any scares and one has to wonder why any studio would finance it.  Pity that the late Richard Crenna's son had to get involved.

Blood too bright and to thin to be blood (looks like that new liquid candy), meal worms bought from a pet store to look like maggots. Very generic lizard tongues and green eyes coming out of people.
