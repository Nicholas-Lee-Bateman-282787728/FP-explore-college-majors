475256,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,6305741972,Crazy Jim,"[2, 2]","In the glory days of No Limit's rap franchise, Master P took &quot;overexposure&quot; to glorious new heights with this very stupid &quot;strugglin' in the hood&quot; tale.Silk The Shocker (P's younger brother) is Kool, a self-proclaimed thug who turns to a life of crime when his girlfriend gets framed for a crime after witnessing a murder. What? Anyways, the story flip-flops all over the place, taking time to throw in every major cliche possible. Kool is an aspiring rapper who also practices martial arts and specializes in car chases. He tries to make a deal with Gary Busey's crooked cop but it doesn't work to his advantage.After his girlfriend is murdered, and his subsquent careers as a martial artist, rapper, basketball player, and NASCAR driver fail, Kool joins up with a crew featuring No Limit rappers, Snoop Dogg, Mystikal, C-Murder, and comedian Anthony &quot;A.J.&quot; Johnson. The crew nicknamed the &quot;Hot Boyz&quot; is a gang that murders major drug dealers in an attempt to take the drug game for themselves. Well, of course.Once you hear the cheesy opening monolouge from Master P's overacting little bro, you know what you're getting into with this one. Master P's over-contrived script takes &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; to brave new heights. In particular, many of the scenes involving Gary Busey's cop character make no sense. In one scene, Kool agrees to set up a major drug dealer played by veteran actor Clifton Powell. Before the situation unfolds, Busey murders a man in cold blood and threatens to blame it on Kool if he doesn't help him out. The motivation for any cop, no matter how crooked he is, to blackmail someone who has already agreed to help him out is non-existent. But wait it gets worse. After deciding to take on a life of crime, gangster Kool shows up at Busey's house and robs him of his entire gun collection. That's right. A police informant shows up at a cop's house with a pistol and robs in the middle of the day. There's a believable scenerio. Of course, at the end of the day, the drug-dealing gangster leaves a trail of dead bodies including rival drug dealers and decorated police officers but due to him &quot;having a good lawyer&quot;, he doesn't end up in prison.Master P the screenwriter is certainly trying hard but he ends up with Ed Wood results. This whole story is just awful. While it tries to play itself in the same veign as classic urban films such as BOYZ N THE HOOD and MENACE II SOCIETY, it could not be any more of a failure. Where those films showed a realistic portrait of &quot;black America&quot;, this one is just going out of its way to take on every element of the action genre. Kool's outlaw attitude has no moral or truly negative outcome. He is just the ultimate black action cliche. &quot;Hot Boyz&quot; is certainly never boring but it seems to blast its way into a series of nonsensical situations before ending more ridicilously than it started.",1,HOT BOYZ Review,1063152000,"09 10, 2003",2003,2947,"['glory', 'days', 'No', 'Limit', 'rap', 'franchise', 'Master', 'P', 'took', 'quot', 'overexposure', 'quot', 'glorious', 'new', 'heights', 'very', 'stupid', 'quot', 'strugglin', 'hood', 'quot', 'Shocker', 'P', 'younger', 'brother', 'Kool', 'self-proclaimed', 'thug', 'who', 'life', 'crime', 'when', 'girlfriend', 'framed', 'crime', 'witnessing', 'murder', 'What', 'Anyways', 'story', 'flip-flops', 'place', 'taking', 'time', 'throw', 'major', 'cliche', 'possible', 'Kool', 'aspiring', 'rapper', 'who', 'also', 'practices', 'martial', 'arts', 'specializes', 'car', 'chases', 'make', 'deal', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'crooked', 'cop', ""n't"", 'work', 'advantage.After', 'girlfriend', 'murdered', 'subsquent', 'careers', 'martial', 'artist', 'rapper', 'basketball', 'player', 'NASCAR', 'driver', 'fail', 'Kool', 'up', 'crew', 'featuring', 'No', 'Limit', 'rappers', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Mystikal', 'C-Murder', 'comedian', 'Anthony', 'quot', 'A.J.', 'quot', 'Johnson', 'crew', 'nicknamed', 'quot', 'Hot', 'Boyz', 'quot', 'gang', 'murders', 'major', 'drug', 'dealers', 'attempt', 'take', 'drug', 'game', 'Well', 'course.Once', 'hear', 'cheesy', 'opening', 'monolouge', 'Master', 'P', 'overacting', 'little', 'bro', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'one', 'Master', 'P', 'over-contrived', 'script', 'quot', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'quot', 'brave', 'new', 'heights', 'particular', 'many', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Gary', 'Busey', 'cop', 'character', 'make', 'sense', 'one', 'scene', 'Kool', 'set', 'up', 'major', 'drug', 'dealer', 'played', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'situation', 'Busey', 'man', 'cold', 'blood', 'blame', 'Kool', ""n't"", 'help', 'out', 'motivation', 'cop', 'matter', 'how', 'crooked', 'blackmail', 'someone', 'who', 'already', 'agreed', 'help', 'out', 'non-existent', 'wait', 'worse', 'deciding', 'take', 'life', 'crime', 'gangster', 'Kool', 'up', 'Busey', 'house', 'robs', 'entire', 'gun', 'collection', 'right', 'police', 'informant', 'up', 'cop', 'house', 'pistol', 'robs', 'middle', 'day', 'believable', 'scenerio', 'course', 'end', 'day', 'drug-dealing', 'gangster', 'trail', 'dead', 'bodies', 'including', 'rival', 'drug', 'dealers', 'decorated', 'police', 'officers', 'due', 'quot', 'having', 'good', 'lawyer', 'quot', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'prison.Master', 'P', 'screenwriter', 'certainly', 'trying', 'hard', 'up', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'results', 'whole', 'story', 'just', 'awful', 'play', 'same', 'veign', 'classic', 'urban', 'films', 'such', 'BOYZ', 'N', 'THE', 'HOOD', 'MENACE', 'II', 'SOCIETY', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'failure', 'Where', 'films', 'showed', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'quot', 'black', 'America', 'quot', 'one', 'just', 'going', 'way', 'take', 'element', 'action', 'genre', 'Kool', 'outlaw', 'attitude', 'moral', 'truly', 'negative', 'outcome', 'just', 'ultimate', 'black', 'action', 'cliche', 'quot', 'Hot', 'Boyz', 'quot', 'certainly', 'never', 'boring', 'blast', 'way', 'series', 'nonsensical', 'situations', 'ending', 'more', 'ridicilously', 'started']",N/A

475269,A3SSDTOYUDY3E3,6305741972,Tony Eugene Arthur,"[0, 0]","Ah, ""Hot Boyz,"" what pleasure do I owe you for writing this review? Nothing, except bashing this movie to no end because it deserves it.I will be honest here. I have a strange thing for B-movies, especially the curiosity of movies starring rappers. Bare this in mind, there aren't a lot of ""rap movies"" that I have seen. One in particular was ""Thicker Than Water"" starring Mack 10 and Fat Joe. Now I remember watching that movie at the age of 14 and enjoying it and while I watched that a few years ago, I can admit how low budget it is and the acting was not great. What gave it a pass for me was decent writing, even though the viewing hasn't held up over time.Now, as for ""Hot Boyz,"" I remember watching that on UPN at 14 as well and actually enjoying it. Fast forward to about a decade later, I am a lot older and wiser and I was able to see how much of a piece of crap this movie really is.Let me just say this. I went through a No Limit phase at some point in my life. I was all into No Limit Records and even wanted to check out the movies that No Limit did. I have only seen ""I Got The Hook Up"" and ""Foolish,"" which were bad but have SOME redeeming qualities. ""Hot Boyz"" has NO REDEEMING QUALITIES WHATSOEVER! The movie had bad acting, bad writing and bad direction. It had every single cliche that you have seen before. Also, the drastic change in plot did the movie no favors at all. I really hated how they tried to make it seem like that girl was a suspect just because she was helping out a cop who was left to die and now she gets life? Let's not forget the fact that the movie was given a happy ending for the main character. Sentenced to 30 but only got five years? Why? Just to stick it to The Man?I could go on about how horrible this movie is. NEVER WATCH THIS!
