471281,A13ZPQNYAWRII9,6305618526,burneyfan@btinternet.com,"[7, 8]","Isabella, played by Marie Riviere, a happily married book-seller, has sympathy for the lonely plight of her best friend Magali, played by Beatrice Romand, a wine grower. Deciding to do something about it, she advertises in a lonely heart's column and, pretending to be Magali, goes on her first date with Gerald,charmingly played by Alain Libolt. Two weeks and several pleasant dates later  she confesses her deception, explains her reason for it, and invites him to her daughter's wedding where she tells him he can meet the real Magali - as if by accident. He accepts the invitation and he and Magali have a lovely encounter in which each makes a very promising impression on the other. But the euphoria she feels does not last. Only moments later she is bitterly disappointed to learn from her son's girl friend that he and Isabella have been meeting in secret. Her disappointment turns to resentment when she catches them behaving in a more than friendly fashion.But it seems to me that what she sees is a plot contrivance put in to add drama and tension to the story line. Without it there would be no film. But it is still a central flaw which undermines the films reality. In one brief minute, in contradiction of everything she has said and that we know about her, Isabella comes on to Gerald and seems to be trying to seduce him. It seems so out of character that you wonder what on earth she is playing at. And at that moment, without either of them noticing who it is, the door is opened by Magali  who seeing them together feels that all her hopes for happiness have been shattered. She feels betrayed. Isabella's subsequent explanation that it was only a peck on the cheek to thank him for liking her friend doesn't hold water, and flies in the face of what we remember. And then she has to face the ordeal of being driven home by Gerald, and her struggle to suppress her rage and inner turmoil is superbly acted. She fails of course and leaves him abruptly, convinced that all now is lost.The ending of the film is a little inconclusive, leaving the question hanging; was Isabella coming on to Gerald or not? and if so what does it portend for the future of all three? But that is another film.This one is typically Rohmer; warm, intimate, a film in which nothing much happens but in which considerable pleasure is to be derived from listening to the charming character's very real conversations  and watching their very subtle and ever changing facial expressions. Just to be in their company is enough.",4,Into the realm of middle-aged romance.,1003276800,"10 17, 2001",2001,2518,"['Isabella', 'played', 'Marie', 'Riviere', 'happily', 'married', 'book-seller', 'sympathy', 'lonely', 'plight', 'best', 'friend', 'Magali', 'played', 'Beatrice', 'Romand', 'wine', 'grower', 'Deciding', 'do', 'something', 'lonely', 'heart', 'column', 'pretending', 'be', 'Magali', 'first', 'date', 'Gerald', 'charmingly', 'played', 'Alain', 'Libolt', 'Two', 'weeks', 'several', 'pleasant', 'dates', 'later', 'deception', 'reason', 'daughter', 'wedding', 'where', 'can', 'meet', 'real', 'Magali', 'accident', 'invitation', 'Magali', 'have', 'lovely', 'encounter', 'very', 'promising', 'impression', 'other', 'euphoria', 'not', 'last', 'Only', 'moments', 'later', 'bitterly', 'disappointed', 'learn', 'son', 'girl', 'friend', 'Isabella', 'have', 'been', 'meeting', 'secret', 'disappointment', 'resentment', 'when', 'behaving', 'more', 'friendly', 'fashion.But', 'what', 'plot', 'contrivance', 'put', 'add', 'drama', 'tension', 'story', 'line', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'still', 'central', 'flaw', 'films', 'reality', 'one', 'brief', 'minute', 'contradiction', 'everything', 'said', 'know', 'Isabella', 'Gerald', 'be', 'trying', 'seduce', 'so', 'character', 'wonder', 'what', 'earth', 'playing', 'moment', 'noticing', 'who', 'door', 'opened', 'Magali', 'who', 'seeing', 'together', 'feels', 'hopes', 'happiness', 'have', 'been', 'shattered', 'betrayed', 'Isabella', 'subsequent', 'explanation', 'was', 'only', 'peck', 'cheek', 'thank', 'liking', 'friend', ""n't"", 'hold', 'water', 'flies', 'face', 'what', 'remember', 'then', 'face', 'ordeal', 'being', 'driven', 'home', 'Gerald', 'struggle', 'suppress', 'rage', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'superbly', 'acted', 'course', 'abruptly', 'convinced', 'now', 'lost.The', 'ending', 'film', 'little', 'inconclusive', 'leaving', 'question', 'hanging', 'was', 'Isabella', 'coming', 'Gerald', 'not', 'so', 'what', 'portend', 'future', 'three', 'film.This', 'one', 'typically', 'Rohmer', 'warm', 'intimate', 'film', 'nothing', 'much', 'happens', 'considerable', 'pleasure', 'be', 'derived', 'listening', 'charming', 'character', 'very', 'real', 'conversations', 'watching', 'very', 'subtle', 'ever', 'changing', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Just', 'be', 'company', 'enough']",Autumn Tale VHS

Here uses France's Cotes du Rhone wine country as a backdrop and symbol to help him explore not only autumn love, but the enduring friendship of two very different women.  Isabelle (Maire Revi&egrave;re) is an elegant, tall, fair haired, blue-eyed haute bourgeoisie and her friend Magali (Beatrice Romand) is a short, earthy, dark-haired petite winemaker originally from Tunisia.  Isabelle is happily married; Magali is divorced.  They are both forty-something.Isabelle's daughter is to be married.  But the focus of the film is not on the bride and groom, but on the older generation, on Isabelle and Magali.  In this way Rohmer combines the warm and enchantment of the celebration of autumn life, when the grapes are ripe for harvest, when love has its last chance, when Dionysus has his festival, when the heat of summer is over and we are ready to reflect and realize what is really important before it's too late.Isabelle feels this strongly and wants her friend to find happiness before another winter comes.  But Magali, because of the vineyard, doesn't have much of an opportunity to meet men, although she allows that she would like to.  She is at that delicate age when one can try again or shrug it off.  Isabelle intervenes by going to a dating service and placing an ad.  She meets Gerald (Alain Libolt) and they have lunch (she insists on lunch) two or three times and she evaluates him.  He is modest, somewhat suave and amazingly diplomatic.  They share a certain attraction.Meanwhile, Rosine (Alexia Portal) who is dating Magali's son and who is very close to Magali, perhaps more so that she is to her son, also wants to find a mate for Magali.  She proposes her philosophy professor, Etienne (Didier Sandre), who is in fact sweet on her.  He is the kind of man who, as Magali observes, likes them younger as he grows older.  But maybe she will be the exception.  Maybe he will finally grow up.  Both arrange for their choices to meet Magali at the wedding.As usual Rohmer explores humanity and how we relate to one another, and finds both love and a kind of sweetness that is liable to bring us to tears.  The resolution of the film is followed by a most endearing anticlimax in which there is a dance of joy.",5,Rohmer knows relationships,1037836800,"11 21, 2002",2002,2433,"['how', 'write', 'dialogue', 'revealing', 'engaging', 'realistic', 'small', 'feat', 'perhaps', 'talent', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'made', 'Eric', 'Rohmer', 'great', 'director', 'Here', 'France', 'Cotes', 'du', 'Rhone', 'wine', 'country', 'backdrop', 'symbol', 'help', 'explore', 'not', 'only', 'autumn', 'love', 'enduring', 'friendship', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'women', 'Isabelle', 'Maire', 'Revi', 'egrave', 're', 'elegant', 'tall', 'fair', 'haired', 'blue-eyed', 'haute', 'bourgeoisie', 'friend', 'Magali', 'Beatrice', 'Romand', 'short', 'earthy', 'dark-haired', 'petite', 'winemaker', 'originally', 'Tunisia', 'Isabelle', 'happily', 'married', 'Magali', 'divorced', 'are', 'forty-something.Isabelle', 'daughter', 'be', 'married', 'focus', 'film', 'not', 'bride', 'groom', 'older', 'generation', 'Isabelle', 'Magali', 'way', 'Rohmer', 'warm', 'enchantment', 'celebration', 'autumn', 'life', 'when', 'grapes', 'are', 'ripe', 'harvest', 'when', 'love', 'last', 'chance', 'when', 'Dionysus', 'festival', 'when', 'heat', 'summer', 'are', 'ready', 'reflect', 'realize', 'what', 'really', 'important', 'too', 'late.Isabelle', 'feels', 'strongly', 'friend', 'find', 'happiness', 'winter', 'Magali', 'vineyard', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'men', 'would', 'like', 'delicate', 'age', 'when', 'one', 'can', 'try', 'again', 'shrug', 'off', 'Isabelle', 'intervenes', 'going', 'dating', 'service', 'placing', 'ad', 'Gerald', 'Alain', 'Libolt', 'have', 'lunch', 'lunch', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'modest', 'somewhat', 'suave', 'amazingly', 'diplomatic', 'share', 'certain', 'attraction.Meanwhile', 'Rosine', 'Alexia', 'Portal', 'who', 'dating', 'Magali', 'son', 'who', 'very', 'close', 'Magali', 'perhaps', 'more', 'so', 'son', 'also', 'find', 'mate', 'Magali', 'philosophy', 'professor', 'Etienne', 'Didier', 'Sandre', 'who', 'fact', 'sweet', 'kind', 'man', 'who', 'Magali', 'younger', 'older', 'maybe', 'will', 'be', 'exception', 'Maybe', 'will', 'finally', 'grow', 'up', 'arrange', 'choices', 'meet', 'Magali', 'wedding.As', 'usual', 'Rohmer', 'humanity', 'how', 'relate', 'one', 'love', 'kind', 'sweetness', 'liable', 'bring', 'tears', 'resolution', 'film', 'followed', 'most', 'endearing', 'anticlimax', 'dance', 'joy']",Autumn Tale VHS

The subtle refinement of the dialogue leaves one smiling with delight. The craft of this piece of art, the beauty of the Rhone valley (slowly being spoiled with industry), the sunswept fields, the wind, and that, acts on the heart like the last drops of a fine wine on the palate. I somewhat doubt that anyone much under forty can fully appreciate the bittersweet qualities of this tale, but for those who have lived enough to have found themselves solitary at an age when stoic resignation is considered a virtue, and dedication to career is seen as a cure, the universality of Magali's cri de couer is full of poignant charm. As so often before Rohmer emphasizes the contingency of romantic attachment while creating two of the most appealing and deserving heroines. The fact that they are the most mature women he has yet depicted suggests that, like Magali's vintage, he feels that one can't really appreciate life until it's been allowed time to ripen.",5,Encore bonheur!,994636800,"07 9, 2001",2001,1091,"['most', 'droll', 'romances', 'yet', 'great', 'storyteller', 'Nothing', 'lacking', 'nothing', 'excessive', 'plot', 'characterization', 'subtle', 'refinement', 'dialogue', 'one', 'smiling', 'delight', 'craft', 'piece', 'art', 'beauty', 'Rhone', 'valley', 'slowly', 'being', 'spoiled', 'industry', 'sunswept', 'fields', 'wind', 'heart', 'last', 'drops', 'fine', 'wine', 'palate', 'somewhat', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'much', 'forty', 'can', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'bittersweet', 'qualities', 'tale', 'who', 'have', 'lived', 'enough', 'have', 'found', 'solitary', 'age', 'when', 'stoic', 'resignation', 'considered', 'virtue', 'dedication', 'career', 'seen', 'cure', 'universality', 'Magali', 'cri', 'de', 'couer', 'full', 'poignant', 'charm', 'so', 'often', 'Rohmer', 'contingency', 'romantic', 'attachment', 'creating', 'two', 'most', 'appealing', 'deserving', 'heroines', 'fact', 'are', 'most', 'mature', 'women', 'yet', 'depicted', 'Magali', 'vintage', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'appreciate', 'life', 'been', 'allowed', 'time', 'ripen']",Autumn Tale VHS

Wonderful to see a continuation of his Tales of the Four Seasons series, equally wonderful to see one of his favourite actors Beatrice Romand front and centre again, with an added maturity only enhanced by her years. Always immediately recognisable by her diction and ease of delivery, as well as her posture and gestures, she brings a poignancy and realism to a sweet little romantic film, ably supported by Marie Riviere and Alain Libolt.

It is a good movie overall, entertaining and amusing. I bought this movie as part of a series about wine. I was a little disappointed to find out it has only a bit to do with wine: French vineyards provide the background of the story and that's about it. Yes Megali does talk about her wine and her relationship with the land, but she could have played the same role in the film if she were growing olive trees.Nonetheless I found it a great movie because it highlights the dynamics of match-making and dating in the pre-internet era. That was the time when there were no online dating sites and instead people wrote ads in papers. There was no email (though at one point in the film one can see a Minitel monitor) and if you were interested in someone you had to call. (Or write to a PO address.)

There is no plot to speak of and the characters seems to be floating on air or in this case floating on air in the Rhone Valley. These lives are lives observed and not dissected. Rohmer leaves it to the viewer to draw conclusions or not. The players include: Magali and her son and her son's girlfriend who used to sleep with her professor and Magali's friend who writes a personal ad to get Magali hooked up. In the telling it sounds silly. But in the viewing it isn't at all silly...just human and real and viewed with empathy on Rohmer's part.
