I can revise at a later time about the DVD and any extras.  Some minor spoilers about the film.American Fusion is a Asian-American Independent comedy directed by first time director Frank Lin.  The film debuted at the San Francisco Asian American Film Festival around 2005.  It hit the theaters in 2007 and had an extended run in Los Angeles and Seattle.  However, due to lack of marketing, the film fizzled in other markets.The film centers around longtime HK actress Sylvia Chang.  Chang portrays a middle-aged divorced woman who feels her life is over before she runs into a handsome doctor (Esai Morales).  In between, there is some family hijinx and jokes galore.  Some jokes are admittedly Chinese/Chinese-American-centric, and it may go over some people's heads.However, as a Chinese-American, I immensely enjoyed the film.  I took two female friends (one Latin American, one Chinese American) and they also enjoyed the film.I felt this film didn't get the exposure it deserved, but it gets a second life on DVD and hopefully, it will do well.",4,Under-Rated Comedy that deserves to be seen.....,1224547200,"10 21, 2008",2008,1173,"['Ok', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'yet', 'However', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'twice', 'so', 'can', 'provide', 'decent', 'review', 'film', 'can', 'revise', 'later', 'time', 'DVD', 'extras', 'minor', 'spoilers', 'film.American', 'Fusion', 'Asian-American', 'Independent', 'comedy', 'directed', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Frank', 'Lin', 'film', 'debuted', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Asian', 'American', 'Film', 'Festival', '2005', 'hit', 'theaters', '2007', 'had', 'extended', 'run', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Seattle', 'However', 'due', 'lack', 'marketing', 'film', 'fizzled', 'other', 'markets.The', 'film', 'centers', 'longtime', 'HK', 'actress', 'Sylvia', 'Chang', 'Chang', 'middle-aged', 'divorced', 'woman', 'who', 'life', 'handsome', 'doctor', 'Esai', 'Morales', 'family', 'hijinx', 'jokes', 'galore', 'jokes', 'are', 'admittedly', 'Chinese/Chinese-American-centric', 'may', 'go', 'over', 'people', 'heads.However', 'Chinese-American', 'immensely', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'took', 'two', 'female', 'friends', 'one', 'Latin', 'American', 'one', 'Chinese', 'American', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'film.I', 'felt', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'exposure', 'deserved', 'second', 'life', 'DVD', 'hopefully', 'will', 'do', 'well']",American Fusion

1199762,AK53SOXQ580CH,B001HB1K28,Martha May,"[1, 1]","AMERICAN FUSION is the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. It's very well written and very well acted. The story is about what happens when two cultures collide and try to combine. Yvonne, (Sylvia Chang), a Chinese journalist, meets up with Jose (Esai Morales), a Mexican dentist. And the fun begins. Yvonne is frustrated by her mother, who traditionally tries to rule her children and grandchildren's lives. Jose, is a good son, but not controlled by his mother or the rest of his family. The cast chemistry, and the dialogue is great! The interaction between Yvonne, her siblings and their mother really makes for good satire. I found myself rooting for Yvonne and Jose just because of their daring to defy the stereotyping of Chinese and Mexican cultures, and choosing to follow their hearts, not ethnic traditions.",5,ANERICAN FUSION,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,819,"['AMERICAN', 'FUSION', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'story', 'what', 'when', 'two', 'cultures', 'collide', 'try', 'combine', 'Yvonne', 'Sylvia', 'Chang', 'Chinese', 'journalist', 'up', 'Jose', 'Esai', 'Morales', 'Mexican', 'dentist', 'fun', 'Yvonne', 'frustrated', 'mother', 'who', 'traditionally', 'rule', 'children', 'grandchildren', 'lives', 'Jose', 'good', 'son', 'not', 'controlled', 'mother', 'rest', 'family', 'cast', 'chemistry', 'dialogue', 'great', 'interaction', 'Yvonne', 'siblings', 'mother', 'really', 'good', 'satire', 'found', 'rooting', 'Yvonne', 'Jose', 'just', 'daring', 'defy', 'stereotyping', 'Chinese', 'Mexican', 'cultures', 'choosing', 'follow', 'hearts', 'not', 'ethnic', 'traditions']",American Fusion
