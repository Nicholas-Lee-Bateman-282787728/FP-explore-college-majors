1268698,A37A6PC5EFSNAV,B002HP4LH4,Bookdragon,"[10, 18]","Yeah, I get it. If you're gay, there's no happy ending. That seems to be the message at the heart of most dramas centered around same-gender attractions. I won't list any spoilers, but I found the end of this film not worth the long, convoluted journey it takes getting there. Despite a promising start, Tong (Mario Maurer)is a doof whose frustrating indecision made me want to scream. The layers of dysfunctional family drama adds a lot of dialogue and confusion, but there's no real message, no real sense of overcoming. I was looking for a twist, a turning point, but the movie just crawls on down the same, worn rut, dragging your heart along with it to no fulfilling resolution.Films (and books as well) like this do little more than wag a finger at gays and say, ""See, that's what your life is going to be - suffering."" The fact that there is no gay hustler character and the film doesn't end with a suicide is a step in the right direction, but to me, it's a small consolation. This film twists the heart, but in the end, leaves you depressed and unfulfilled.",2,Being Gay Is Miserable!,1285286400,"09 24, 2010",2010,1066,"['Yeah', 'get', ""'re"", 'gay', 'happy', 'ending', 'be', 'message', 'heart', 'most', 'dramas', 'centered', 'same-gender', 'attractions', 'wo', ""n't"", 'list', 'spoilers', 'found', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'long', 'convoluted', 'journey', 'getting', 'there', 'promising', 'start', 'Tong', 'Mario', 'Maurer', 'doof', 'frustrating', 'indecision', 'made', 'want', 'scream', 'layers', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'drama', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'confusion', 'real', 'message', 'real', 'sense', 'overcoming', 'was', 'looking', 'twist', 'turning', 'point', 'movie', 'just', 'crawls', 'same', 'worn', 'rut', 'dragging', 'heart', 'fulfilling', 'resolution.Films', 'books', 'well', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'wag', 'finger', 'gays', 'say', 'See', 'what', 'life', 'going', 'be', 'suffering', 'fact', 'gay', 'hustler', 'character', 'film', ""n't"", 'end', 'suicide', 'step', 'right', 'direction', 'small', 'consolation', 'film', 'heart', 'end', 'depressed', 'unfulfilled']",Love of Siam

The music score, actually sang by the actor, is great.This movie is a tear jerker and you may not agree with the ending, but life seldom ends the way you want.  That only happens in a Disney movie.  I saw this movie through a movie rental and had to buy it after seeing it.  It is in Thai with English subtitles.  The first time I watched the movie I spent a lot of time reading the subtitles.  But the second time I watched.  I was able to really get into the movie even more now knowing what they where saying.  This wonderful movie is really a great love story.

1268704,A2SE9F3RBSJQEH,B002HP4LH4,Thierry,"[3, 3]","I lived in Bangkok for 2 years in the 1970's. From the movie Love of Siam, I can see how things have changed. This film concerns a group of very affluent Thai families, their daily lives and loves, and illustrates how far Thailand has come in the past 40 years since I was there.There is now a substantial middle class and upwardly mobile elite.The film attempts of portray several relationships that are complex and interesting, and does a good job in their portrayal. One scenario concerning the primary husband and wife and their two children is done quite well. The daughter disappears never to be heard from again and the son unwittingly has to become the man of the family with a dominating, neurotic Mother and alcoholic Father.The son really has alot of sexual identity confusion to deal with. On the one hand, he has a very demanding rigid, childish, neurotic girlfriend to contend with, much like his Mother, and on the other hand, a very talented, nice male friend, who hopes to be his boyfriend.  He is guilted by his Mother's needs to be the man she needs him to be when he begins to develop feelings for his male friend.Several other stories of people who interact with each other in various roles throughout the film and done quite nicely and by the end of the film, has resolved many of the issues that they have had to deal with throughout the film.I would recommend this film highly for someone interested in modern Thai society and for teenagers in particularly who want to see how teenager deal with adolescence in another culture.",4,How well-heeled Thais live their lives,1337904000,"05 25, 2012",2012,1551,"['lived', 'Bangkok', '2', 'years', '1970', 'movie', 'Love', 'Siam', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'film', 'group', 'very', 'affluent', 'Thai', 'families', 'daily', 'lives', 'loves', 'how', 'far', 'Thailand', 'come', 'past', '40', 'years', 'was', 'now', 'substantial', 'middle', 'class', 'upwardly', 'mobile', 'elite.The', 'film', 'attempts', 'portray', 'several', 'relationships', 'are', 'complex', 'interesting', 'good', 'job', 'portrayal', 'One', 'scenario', 'concerning', 'primary', 'husband', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'daughter', 'never', 'be', 'heard', 'again', 'son', 'unwittingly', 'become', 'man', 'family', 'dominating', 'neurotic', 'Mother', 'alcoholic', 'Father.The', 'son', 'really', 'alot', 'sexual', 'identity', 'confusion', 'deal', 'one', 'hand', 'very', 'demanding', 'rigid', 'childish', 'neurotic', 'girlfriend', 'contend', 'much', 'Mother', 'other', 'hand', 'very', 'talented', 'nice', 'male', 'friend', 'who', 'be', 'boyfriend', 'guilted', 'Mother', 'needs', 'be', 'man', 'be', 'when', 'develop', 'feelings', 'male', 'friend.Several', 'other', 'stories', 'people', 'who', 'interact', 'other', 'various', 'roles', 'film', 'done', 'quite', 'nicely', 'end', 'film', 'resolved', 'many', 'issues', 'have', 'had', 'deal', 'film.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'highly', 'someone', 'interested', 'modern', 'Thai', 'society', 'teenagers', 'particularly', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'teenager', 'deal', 'adolescence', 'culture']",Love of Siam
