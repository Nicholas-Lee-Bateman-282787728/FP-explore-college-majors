750783,A1J5B9VM8ZPQPP,B00008Z44H,David,"[69, 71]","VOSF was actually better than I expected. It isn't in the same league as Surrender's a-list titles from the mid to late 90's, but it can still respectfully wear the softcore badge. The plot is a rip of ""A Connecticut Yankee"". It starts out in modern times on a video shoot for a rock star. But the director, Gabriella Hall, gets knocked on the head and wakes up in Sherwood Forest in the days of Robin Hood. The sheriff of Nottingham is gone, but his evil, horny, large breasted sister has shown up to cause problems. It's all very tongue in cheek and sufficient to justify several sex scenes.There are eight sex scenes. Seven are boy/girl and one is girl/girl. There are also a couple of ""forest strip club"" scenes (don't ask). There are four women and they are all attractive and the sex scenes are all decent. But like I said above, this is a far cry from what Surrender and Cybil Richards (the director) gave us a few years earlier in titles like Femalien and Virtual Encounters.I want to make it clear that I am reviewing the most recent Shadow DVD release. This disk definitely does contain the unrated version, and not some hacked up R rated version.If you're a big fan of one or more of the main actresses (Gabriella Hall, Amber Newman, or Shannan Leigh) I'd recommend this.",4,"Not bad, but not Surrender's best.",1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,1282,"['VOSF', 'was', 'actually', 'better', 'expected', ""n't"", 'same', 'league', 'Surrender', 'a-list', 'titles', 'mid', 'late', '90', 'can', 'still', 'respectfully', 'wear', 'softcore', 'badge', 'plot', 'rip', 'A', 'Connecticut', 'Yankee', 'out', 'modern', 'times', 'video', 'shoot', 'rock', 'star', 'director', 'Gabriella', 'Hall', 'knocked', 'head', 'up', 'Sherwood', 'Forest', 'days', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'sheriff', 'Nottingham', 'gone', 'evil', 'horny', 'large', 'breasted', 'sister', 'shown', 'up', 'cause', 'problems', 'very', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'sufficient', 'justify', 'several', 'sex', 'are', 'eight', 'sex', 'scenes', 'Seven', 'are', 'boy/girl', 'one', 'girl/girl', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'forest', 'strip', 'club', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'are', 'four', 'women', 'are', 'attractive', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'decent', 'said', 'above', 'far', 'cry', 'what', 'Surrender', 'Cybil', 'Richards', 'director', 'gave', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'titles', 'Femalien', 'Virtual', 'Encounters.I', 'want', 'make', 'clear', 'am', 'reviewing', 'most', 'recent', 'Shadow', 'DVD', 'release', 'disk', 'definitely', 'contain', 'unrated', 'version', 'not', 'hacked', 'up', 'R', 'rated', 'version.If', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'one', 'more', 'main', 'actresses', 'Gabriella', 'Hall', 'Amber', 'Newman', 'Shannan', 'Leigh', ""'d"", 'recommend']",N/A

The nudity and sex are disappointing. Soft-core of this era had really started pushing the boundaries and Surrender Cinema was the studio that led the way. I don't know if this is an edited version or what (it indicates otherwise, but you never really know), but this isn't a big deal. Sex scenes are somewhat boring and limited, nudity doesn't get beyond full frontal and not even a whole lot of that.Surrender spoiled us with &#34;Femalien&#34; all those years ago. &#34;Virgins of Sherwood Forest&#34; (which by the way, there are no virgins here) isn't sexy enough to keep your attention, either in terms of exposure or of hot women, and certainly isn't interesting enough in plot to do so.
