It has your standard anime good vs evil.  Monsters, battles upon battles and all of that other stuff.  But Inuyasha brings up a notch with its excellent interaction between each of the characters Kagome (who gets sucked into this world through a well in her present day home) she makes trips back and for to see her family (Mom, grandfather and lil brother) and Inuyasha (with her sit boy affect everytime he annoys her which is pretty much all the time) that smashes Inuyasha's face in the ground on a regular basis, Sango and Maroku (sometimes liking each other but mostly Sango's slapping him because he can't keep his hands off of her bottom..for lack of a better term and every other female for that matter) and he's a monk on top of it.  It adds something extra to an already great story...along with Shipo, Kilala (Sango's pet that turns into a ferocious cat when in battle).  Plus Inuyasha's brother Seshomaru (sp?) who has his own issues with his little brother and the big bad evil of the whole show Naraku (he's one powerful guy no question) and uses any and all means to get what he wants.  Also add to the fact Inuyasha's past won't go away in the form his lover Kikiyo and of course she has a younger sister (not so young looking now that 50 years have passed) who is a priestess just like her.Its just a great collection brought together for fans of old and new to enjoy at their leisure with so much action going and everyone trying to get a piece of that Sacred Jewel shard..its no wonder so many monsters are running loss all over the countryside.  Of course with the way Season 3 ended its only going to get more intense for everyone as they continue to search for more jewel shard fragments and a way to wipe out Naraku for good.Excellent buy and so addictive its crazy.",5,one of the reasons i love Anime so much,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,1858,"['hard', 'believe', 'show', 'continued', 'bring', 'fans', 'standard', 'anime', 'good', 'vs', 'evil', 'Monsters', 'battles', 'battles', 'other', 'stuff', 'Inuyasha', 'up', 'notch', 'excellent', 'interaction', 'characters', 'Kagome', 'who', 'sucked', 'world', 'well', 'present', 'day', 'home', 'trips', 'back', 'see', 'family', 'Mom', 'grandfather', 'lil', 'brother', 'Inuyasha', 'sit', 'boy', 'affect', 'everytime', 'pretty', 'much', 'time', 'Inuyasha', 'face', 'ground', 'regular', 'basis', 'Sango', 'Maroku', 'sometimes', 'liking', 'other', 'mostly', 'Sango', 'slapping', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'hands', 'bottom..for', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'other', 'female', 'matter', 'monk', 'top', 'something', 'extra', 'already', 'great', 'story', 'Shipo', 'Kilala', 'Sango', 'pet', 'ferocious', 'cat', 'when', 'battle', 'Inuyasha', 'brother', 'Seshomaru', 'sp', 'who', 'own', 'issues', 'little', 'brother', 'big', 'bad', 'evil', 'whole', 'show', 'Naraku', 'one', 'powerful', 'guy', 'question', 'means', 'get', 'what', 'Also', 'add', 'fact', 'Inuyasha', 'past', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'form', 'lover', 'Kikiyo', 'course', 'younger', 'sister', 'not', 'so', 'young', 'looking', 'now', '50', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'who', 'priestess', 'just', 'her.Its', 'just', 'great', 'collection', 'brought', 'together', 'fans', 'old', 'new', 'enjoy', 'leisure', 'so', 'much', 'action', 'going', 'everyone', 'trying', 'get', 'piece', 'Sacred', 'Jewel', 'wonder', 'so', 'many', 'monsters', 'are', 'running', 'loss', 'countryside', 'course', 'way', 'Season', '3', 'ended', 'only', 'going', 'get', 'more', 'intense', 'everyone', 'continue', 'search', 'more', 'jewel', 'shard', 'fragments', 'way', 'wipe', 'out', 'Naraku', 'good.Excellent', 'buy', 'so', 'addictive', 'crazy']",Inuyasha - Season 3
1005269,A2VF73N1AI95SQ,B000GLL1AQ,Dylan,"[13, 14]","I recently purchased the Inuyasha Season 3 DVD Box Set with necklace.  I must admit that Inuyasha is my second favorite anime, and television show altogether.  The characters and conflicts are never boring and almost every episode will leave you wanting more.Specifically, this season contains episodes 55 up to and including 81. This season focuses on battles with Naraku, as well as Inuyasha empowering his sword the Tetsusaiga, but it also gives us a glimpse into the past with Kikyo, Inuyasha, And Sesshomaru.  The episodes are on 5 discs and each disc contains 5 episodes except for the last 2 which each have 6 episodes of the show.  You can choose to watch the episodes in English or Japanese, with subtitles only in English.  I bought the edition with Kagome's necklace, or bottle with the Shikon shards inside.Some highlights of this season include the first appearance of Tsubaki, the evil Dark Priestess who knew Kikyo even before she met Inuyasha.  Naraku has recruited her help to try and destroy Kagome!  Next you'll see Naraku release Musso, his newest incarnation, but Musso is much different from any other incarnation so far and his actions will cause a Three Sided Battle to the Death between Naraku, Inuyasha, and himself.  Next Inuyasha must empower his sword Tetsusaiga by slaying Taigokomeru, the evil Bat Demon, but will Inuyasha's heart let him kill the real one behind Taigokomeru?Next we get into a history lesson of Sesshomaru's past as the panther demons that he and his father fought years ago return for revenge.  These episodes especially explain much including why Sesshomaru hates Inuyasha so much. They also show the continuing maturing of Tenseiga, Sesshomaru's strongest(yes I said strongest) sword.  The season ends with Naraku trying to absorb Sesshomaru into his body.  Will Sesshomaru be able to defeat Naraku on his own, or will Inuyasha have to come to his aid?  The outcome is unbelievable!I recommend these great episodes of Inuyasha to any fan.  The price is far better than buying the individual DVDs and there are many more adventures than the few I mentioned above.

The main highlights of this season include: the story of resurrected ""dark"" priestess Tsubaki - former rival to Kikyo, now new recruit under Naraku; Inuyasha's quest to further strengthen the Tetsusaiga in order to break Naraku's new barrier; and the dramatic confrontation between Naraku and the two Inu (dog) demons Inuyasha and Sesshoumaru.I really can't complain about Inuyasha - the only problem that could be called into question is the series' length.

Every episode here is lots of fun to see, but really note-worthy stuff that happens here is the two-part epidsode ""Fateful Night In Togenkyo"", where our heros (minus Sango, who has gone to repair her weapon,) encounter a sage who has sold his soul to a tree demon and now shinks people down and eats them. This, by the way, was a story that in the manga occured much earlier, just before the characters met Sango for the first time. Which makes this the only major change the anime makes from it's source material, at least that I'm aware of. (I stopped reading the manga when they stospped releasing it in soft-cover single-issue format in the U.S., which would be after Inu-Yasha's party first meet Koga and Kagome gets upset with Inu-Yasha for implying that she might have had an indecent relasionship with him and she storms back to the present day.)Anyway. There's also the afore-mentioned Tsubaki story-arch, when the group must face an old enemy of Kikyo's. Other major things that happen here is Naraku gives life to another demon, one that starts out without a face until he takes one from one of his victims, and who turns out to be the re-incarnated Onigumo, the thief who sold his soul to demons which led to the creation of Naraku. And then Inu-Yasha sets out on a quest to make his tetsaiga more powerful, but to accomplish that he just might have to take an innocent life. Later Inu-Yasha and his comrades, Koga and his wolf pack, and Sesshomaru and his lackie Jaken all battle a clan of panther demons. Inu-Yasha's group and Koga also want to rescue Kagome, who's been captured by the panthers. (Now if only they could all stop fighting each other, they just might win...) Finally, Kagome and co. make a starteling discovery when they learn about Rin, the little human girl who travels with Sesshomaru and Jaken.One thing I really love about this season is we get two episodes where Kagome shows she has a really cute, girlish side to her. (""Shippo Gets An Angry Challenge"" and ""Only You, Sango"") Also I enjoyed ""Jaken's Plan To Steal The Tetsaiga"", where the lizard-like imp sets out on his own, with Rin tagging along, to...well, the name pretty much says it. Jaken becomes much like Wilie E. Cyote from the Road-Runner cartoons, with every scheme to steal Inu-Yasha's sword inevitably ending in disaster.Can't wait for season 4 to come out on box-set.
