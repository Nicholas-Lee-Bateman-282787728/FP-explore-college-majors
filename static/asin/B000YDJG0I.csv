He also said, ""Do It!""  Another famous slogan was, ""If you're not a part of the solution, you're a part of the problem.""  Although not axiomatic, Professor Stephen Malley (Robert Redford) reaches out to one of his brightest students, Todd (Andrew Garfield), and barters with him to come back and attend his class.  The banter between Dr. and student is filled with wit and insight.  Still, Dr. Malley makes those sayings new [from his perspective] as a Vietnam War veteran whose only injuries were sustained on the picket line when he returned home and protested the war.  Yet, that is the statement of 'Lions for Lambs' theme:  Take a stand and do something.  (*That's not a typo; it stood for Y.outh I.nternational P.arty.)In the meantime, a Peggy Noonan-esque reporter, Janine Bach (Meryl Streep), is interviewing G.O.P. Senator Jeremy Irving (Tom Cruise) in his private chamber.  As they speak, new troops are filtering into the mountains of Afghanistan, one meant to bring a victory to the War on Terror and build momentum for toppling Iran's nuclear capability.  He offers her an exclusive pipeline to his office and the developments of this new ""surge"" in troops.  She comes cordially--like she's a friend--but isn't afraid to ask tough questions during the interview--but they are the kind a conservative columnist would certainly ask.  Will she take his offer?  In later scenes, she and her editor spar over just that.The third front brings the only real action of the picture.  Colonel Falco briefs and commands his troops sent via chopper to the mountains of Afghanistan.  His Q and A session with his men, particularly with Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pena) tells us a good deal.Much of the movie is a one on one debate between two speakers, each playing Devil's Advocate for one another.  In similar fashion, I will now engage in a debate on the merits of the movie with my own Devil's Advocate.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Devil's Advocate:  This film is like the title of an old Psychedelic Furs album, 'Talk, Talk, Talk'.  Why should anyone want to see it?JP:  One has to take the film by its quality--not by its format--'My Dinner with Andre' is considered one of Louis' Malle's masterpieces--and all it has is talk.D.A.:  You've never seen `My Dinner with Andre'.  How would you know?JP:  Well, it's one of the most revered movies.  It's like on  those ""Greatest Movies"" lists by Roger Ebert, et al. Even to rent it you have to practically inherit a copy from a deceased relative for cry eye!  In principle it still proves a good movie can have just talk.D.A.:  Why not see a documentary--like 'No End in Sight'?JP:  The wit and banter of this movie are formidable.  I mean--I think they grapple at the truth, skipping the idea that everything's all black and white.  They ask the right questions and at least offer some compelling answers--not final answers, mind you, but good ones.  By all means, see both.D.A.:  Why not save your money and stay at home and watch CNN and Fox News each for half an hour?JP:  The caliber is richer and more condensed in this movie.  It's more worthwhile.DA:  Is this cinematic ping pong match really better than sitting on your couch and watching Jon Stewart?JP:  I don't know if it's better...It's just different.  It challenges you from all sides.  The movie asks difficult questions and makes some great, pointed observations.D.A. Is anyone going to win an Oscar for this movie?JP:  No, but the performances are natural and believable throughout.DA:  Why should we believe a reviewer who gave one star to 'Conversations with Other Women' and two stars to 'The Death of Mr. Lazarescu,' but also gave 'The Guardian' four stars and 'Flyboys' five?!JP:  When I sat down to give points to movies at the end of the year, I discovered  that while 'The Death...' was too ""real time,"" and I still hated 'Conversations...'; objectively, they were well crafted and original.  I still felt better about those two favorites, but they fell in value.  You have a point, though.  Now that I have a point system I use, I can be more objective than just how I feel about a movie.DA:  You're on the defensive, I see, but I have to admit that you have improved.  But, this conversation is going nowhere, which is about what I'd say about the movie.JP:  It's just like you to try and have the last word.DA:  Yep.  But, remember,  you're the one controlling the dialogue for both of us.  It's contrived, just like the exchange in the movie...See yah!!!",3,"""Give a Damn""/ Q & A with The Devil's Advocate",1194825600,"11 12, 2007",2007,4609,"['Give', 'Damn', 'was', 'Yippie*', 'leader', 'Jerry', 'Ruben', 'axiom', 'sixties', 'also', 'said', 'Do', 'famous', 'slogan', 'was', ""'re"", 'not', 'part', 'solution', ""'re"", 'part', 'problem', 'not', 'axiomatic', 'Professor', 'Stephen', 'Malley', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'out', 'one', 'brightest', 'students', 'Todd', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'barters', 'come', 'back', 'attend', 'class', 'banter', 'Dr.', 'student', 'filled', 'wit', 'insight', 'Still', 'Dr.', 'Malley', 'sayings', 'new', '[', 'perspective', ']', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'veteran', 'only', 'injuries', 'were', 'sustained', 'picket', 'line', 'when', 'returned', 'home', 'protested', 'war', 'statement', ""'Lions"", 'Lambs', 'theme', 'Take', 'stand', 'do', 'something', '*That', 'not', 'typo', 'stood', 'Y.outh', 'I.nternational', 'P.arty', 'meantime', 'Peggy', 'Noonan-esque', 'reporter', 'Janine', 'Bach', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'interviewing', 'G.O.P', 'Senator', 'Jeremy', 'Irving', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'private', 'chamber', 'speak', 'new', 'troops', 'are', 'filtering', 'mountains', 'Afghanistan', 'one', 'meant', 'bring', 'victory', 'War', 'Terror', 'build', 'momentum', 'toppling', 'Iran', 'nuclear', 'capability', 'exclusive', 'pipeline', 'office', 'developments', 'new', 'surge', 'troops', 'cordially', 'friend', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'ask', 'tough', 'questions', 'interview', 'are', 'kind', 'conservative', 'columnist', 'would', 'certainly', 'ask', 'Will', 'take', 'offer', 'later', 'scenes', 'editor', 'spar', 'just', 'that.The', 'third', 'front', 'only', 'real', 'action', 'picture', 'Colonel', 'Falco', 'briefs', 'troops', 'sent', 'chopper', 'mountains', 'Afghanistan', 'Q', 'session', 'men', 'particularly', 'Ernest', 'Rodriguez', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'good', 'deal.Much', 'movie', 'one', 'one', 'debate', 'two', 'speakers', 'playing', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'one', 'similar', 'fashion', 'will', 'now', 'engage', 'debate', 'merits', 'movie', 'own', 'Devil', 'Advocate.', 'Devil', 'Advocate', 'film', 'title', 'old', 'Psychedelic', 'Furs', 'album', 'Talk', 'Talk', 'Why', 'should', 'anyone', 'want', 'see', 'JP', 'One', 'take', 'film', 'quality', 'not', 'format', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'considered', 'one', 'Louis', 'Malle', 'masterpieces', 'talk.D.A', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Dinner', 'Andre', 'How', 'would', 'know', 'JP', 'Well', 'one', 'most', 'revered', 'movies', 'Greatest', 'Movies', 'lists', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'et', 'al', 'Even', 'rent', 'have', 'practically', 'inherit', 'copy', 'deceased', 'relative', 'cry', 'eye', 'principle', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'can', 'have', 'just', 'talk.D.A', 'Why', 'not', 'see', 'documentary', ""'No"", 'End', 'Sight', 'JP', 'wit', 'banter', 'movie', 'are', 'formidable', 'mean', 'think', 'grapple', 'truth', 'skipping', 'idea', 'everything', 'black', 'white', 'ask', 'right', 'questions', 'least', 'offer', 'compelling', 'answers', 'not', 'final', 'answers', 'mind', 'good', 'ones', 'means', 'see', 'both.D.A', 'Why', 'not', 'save', 'money', 'stay', 'home', 'watch', 'CNN', 'Fox', 'News', 'hour', 'JP', 'caliber', 'richer', 'more', 'condensed', 'movie', 'more', 'worthwhile.DA', 'cinematic', 'ping', 'pong', 'match', 'really', 'better', 'sitting', 'couch', 'watching', 'Jon', 'Stewart', 'JP', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'just', 'different', 'sides', 'movie', 'difficult', 'questions', 'great', 'pointed', 'observations.D.A', 'anyone', 'going', 'win', 'Oscar', 'movie', 'JP', 'No', 'performances', 'are', 'natural', 'believable', 'throughout.DA', 'Why', 'should', 'believe', 'reviewer', 'who', 'gave', 'one', 'star', ""'Conversations"", 'Other', 'Women', 'two', 'stars', ""'The"", 'Death', 'Mr.', 'Lazarescu', 'also', 'gave', 'Guardian', 'four', 'stars', 'five', 'JP', 'When', 'sat', 'down', 'give', 'points', 'movies', 'end', 'year', 'discovered', ""'The"", 'Death', 'was', 'too', 'real', 'time', 'still', 'hated', ""'Conversations"", 'objectively', 'were', 'well', 'crafted', 'original', 'still', 'felt', 'better', 'two', 'favorites', 'fell', 'value', 'have', 'point', 'Now', 'have', 'point', 'system', 'use', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'objective', 'just', 'how', 'feel', 'movie.DA', ""'re"", 'defensive', 'see', 'have', 'admit', 'have', 'improved', 'conversation', 'going', 'nowhere', 'what', ""'d"", 'say', 'movie.JP', 'just', 'try', 'have', 'last', 'word.DA', 'Yep', 'remember', ""'re"", 'one', 'controlling', 'dialogue', 'contrived', 'just', 'exchange', 'movie', 'See', 'yah']",Lions for Lambs Theatrical Release
1118517,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000YDJG0I,Alex Udvary,"[5, 7]","Last year I tried to make the case that the best films of the year were the ones that scared the love of Jesus in us. They were movies which told us the world is in trouble, evil lurks everywhere, we aren't safe. It didn't matter what the films was, ""The Departed"", ""The Curse of the Golden Flower"", ""Babel"", ""United 93"" or ""Pan's Labyrinth"". This year it is a little different. The films this year seem to take us back to the 1960s. There has been a steady trend since 2004 of very political films. First they started out as documentaries; ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", ""The War Tapes"", ""No End in Sight"", ""Uncovered"", ""Hunting of a President"", ""Bush's Brain""...ect Then featured films started to tackle the issues, ""Good Night & Good Luck"", ""Syriana"" and now Robert Redford's ""Lions for Lambs"".""Lions for Lambs"" surprisingly has not been getting a lot of traction. It hasn't pulled in impressive box-office, critics did not welcome it and neither did the public. It's hard to say why, but I'm glad I saw the film anyway. It's one of the better films released this year.Naturally, with any political film, there will be those of an opposing view who will damn the movie because it does not represent their political side. But, I think this was Redford's point. If you don't like the film, ask yourself why? Because of its politics? What about its politics don't you like? See what's happening here, a discussion, a debate. Just what we need.""Lions of Lambs"",if I listened correctly, is a film which argues President Bush is incompetent, mistakes were made during the Iraq war, the media didn't question this war and Iraq is now a quagmire. We are no longer fighting in Iraq for our original intention, and the situation has escalated beyond our control and the war is not winnable.Many have argued the film is not saying anything new. Maybe. But what I admire about the film is the way it says what it says. People aren't going to see this movie,a shame, but, this is the kind of film that twenty years from now if my children were to watch it and ask me, is this what people thought of Bush and the Iraq war? I could look them straight in the eyes and say yes, this is exactly what people thought. ""Lions for Lambs"" then becomes a time capsule. It is a film which I think could add to our national dialogue. It takes ideas and stances on issues which many people feel and reflects them in an articulate manner.The film revolves around three storylines all happening at once. Redford plays a professor trying to talk a student (Andrew Garfield) into sticking to his class and recognizing his potential. Tom Cruise plays Sen. Jasper Irving a chest pounding, war hungry Republican giving an interview to reporter Janine Roth (Merly Streep) on a new military strategy, which is basically, prolong the war. And finally a military mission going on in Afghanistan, which involves two of Redford's former students, both who enlisted in the war against their professor's advice, who had been drafted in Vietnam.These three stories come together by the time the film ends and Redford's intentions are quite clear with the film. It is anti-Bush and anti-war. But so what? At least the film is about something. Why does the public think that is such a bad idea. Going back to the 1960s at least filmmakers then had the guts to make films about something. They were usually made by directors with last names like Godard, Bergman and Tarkovsky. I'm not saying Redford is as good as these directors but he has made a film which reminds me of the spirit of those films. Like a Godard films such as ""Tout va bien"" or ""Weekend"", ""Lions for Lambs"" is a movie which in time I think will be seen as a time capsule, a reflection  of the public's conscience.As you might be able to tell from my description the film is not really about anything else besides its ideas. The cinematography is not memorable,nor is the music or the editing. It is shot conventionally. The performances are good and get their point across, but I doubt Cruise or Streep will get nominated for their work here. Though both do a fine job. But despite everything,I still think people should see this film.Bottom-line: A perfect time capsule of the times we will. A film which deals with contemporary ideas and issues. I think one of the year's best films.",4,Do Not Feed The Lions,1195862400,"11 24, 2007",2007,4298,"['Last', 'year', 'tried', 'make', 'case', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'were', 'ones', 'scared', 'love', 'Jesus', 'were', 'movies', 'told', 'world', 'trouble', 'evil', 'lurks', 'everywhere', 'are', ""n't"", 'safe', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'what', 'films', 'was', 'Departed', 'Curse', 'Golden', 'Flower', 'Babel', 'United', '93', 'Pan', 'Labyrinth', 'year', 'little', 'different', 'films', 'year', 'seem', 'take', 'back', '1960s', 'been', 'steady', 'trend', '2004', 'very', 'political', 'films', 'First', 'started', 'out', 'documentaries', '9/11', 'War', 'Tapes', 'End', 'Sight', 'Uncovered', 'Hunting', 'President', 'Bush', 'Brain', 'ect', 'Then', 'featured', 'films', 'started', 'tackle', 'issues', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Syriana', 'now', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'been', 'getting', 'lot', 'traction', ""n't"", 'pulled', 'impressive', 'box-office', 'critics', 'did', 'not', 'welcome', 'neither', 'did', 'public', 'hard', 'say', 'why', ""'m"", 'glad', 'saw', 'film', 'anyway', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'released', 'year.Naturally', 'political', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'opposing', 'view', 'who', 'will', 'damn', 'movie', 'not', 'represent', 'political', 'side', 'think', 'was', 'Redford', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'ask', 'why', 'politics', 'What', 'politics', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'See', 'what', 'happening', 'here', 'discussion', 'debate', 'Just', 'what', 'need', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'listened', 'correctly', 'film', 'President', 'Bush', 'incompetent', 'mistakes', 'were', 'made', 'Iraq', 'war', 'media', 'did', ""n't"", 'question', 'war', 'Iraq', 'now', 'quagmire', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'fighting', 'Iraq', 'original', 'intention', 'situation', 'escalated', 'control', 'war', 'not', 'winnable.Many', 'have', 'argued', 'film', 'not', 'saying', 'anything', 'new', 'Maybe', 'what', 'admire', 'film', 'way', 'what', 'People', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'shame', 'kind', 'film', 'twenty', 'years', 'now', 'children', 'were', 'watch', 'ask', 'what', 'people', 'thought', 'Bush', 'Iraq', 'war', 'could', 'look', 'straight', 'eyes', 'say', 'yes', 'exactly', 'what', 'people', 'thought', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'then', 'time', 'capsule', 'film', 'think', 'could', 'add', 'national', 'dialogue', 'ideas', 'stances', 'issues', 'many', 'people', 'feel', 'articulate', 'manner.The', 'film', 'revolves', 'three', 'storylines', 'happening', 'once', 'Redford', 'professor', 'trying', 'talk', 'student', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'sticking', 'class', 'recognizing', 'potential', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Sen.', 'Jasper', 'Irving', 'chest', 'pounding', 'war', 'hungry', 'Republican', 'giving', 'interview', 'reporter', 'Janine', 'Roth', 'Merly', 'Streep', 'new', 'military', 'strategy', 'basically', 'war', 'finally', 'military', 'mission', 'going', 'Afghanistan', 'two', 'Redford', 'former', 'students', 'who', 'enlisted', 'war', 'professor', 'advice', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'drafted', 'Vietnam.These', 'three', 'stories', 'come', 'together', 'time', 'film', 'ends', 'Redford', 'intentions', 'are', 'quite', 'clear', 'film', 'anti-Bush', 'anti-war', 'so', 'what', 'least', 'film', 'something', 'Why', 'public', 'think', 'bad', 'idea', 'Going', 'back', '1960s', 'least', 'filmmakers', 'then', 'had', 'guts', 'make', 'films', 'something', 'were', 'usually', 'made', 'directors', 'last', 'names', 'Godard', 'Bergman', 'Tarkovsky', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'Redford', 'as', 'good', 'directors', 'made', 'film', 'spirit', 'films', 'Godard', 'films', 'such', 'Tout', 'va', 'bien', 'Weekend', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'movie', 'time', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'time', 'capsule', 'reflection', 'public', 'conscience.As', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'description', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'anything', 'else', 'ideas', 'cinematography', 'not', 'memorable', 'music', 'editing', 'shot', 'conventionally', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'get', 'point', 'doubt', 'Cruise', 'Streep', 'will', 'get', 'nominated', 'work', 'here', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'everything', 'still', 'think', 'people', 'should', 'see', 'film.Bottom-line', 'perfect', 'time', 'capsule', 'times', 'will', 'A', 'film', 'contemporary', 'ideas', 'issues', 'think', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'films']",Lions for Lambs Theatrical Release
1118518,AVAHA06K08ZKK,B000YDJG0I,Alwyn Lau,"[5, 7]","This is not a Tom Cruise movie, nor is it a Meryl Streep movie and it's barely a Robert Redford movie. Frankly, Lions for Lambs is barely a ""movie"" at all and if you wish to enjoy it you mustn't think of it as such, let alone a blockbuster movie. L4L is best savoured as a pseudo-documentary, not quite like Inconvenient Truth, though not that far away either.In fact, the film could really be named Inconvenient Talk or Inconvenient Topics, as it's really about, well, talking about tough topics with no clear consensus view - in politics, in education, in media about the role of America and Americans in the war on terror, in the classroom, in public knowledge, in government, as minorities, as the privileged and so on.You've got Robert Redford, a professor trying to convince possibly his brightest student that there's more to life than just earning degrees and growing rich. His take on crises like the Iraqi war, possibly echoing Redford's personal view, is that the younger generation can't sit back and blame the hopeless politicians. The people of America have got to do something, although two other students of his take the view to (what he views as) an extreme position by actualling signing up to fight.These two students - a Puerto Rican and Negro - also form the other key segment of the show, a snow-battle in the mountains of Afghanistan resulting from a very poorly planned US military op. This fiasco was in turn the brainchild of Senator Jasper Irving, played with boyish gusto by Tom Cruise, the poster child of American Republican politics who says all the right things and ducks most of the tough questions, and does both with a huge grin. Irving invites Meryl Streep's character, a journalist, to do an exclusive on the new military strategy and in the process engages in a tense debate on the failures and futures of American foreign policy in the context of the war on terror.L4L is all about the arguments. Back forth back forth - it's one big plurivocal textbook played out in motion picturesque.Should Americans be indifferent, should they apologise, should they curse the politicians (those who never say anything but never stop talking, and who keep repeating that, ""I am NOT running for President"") and ignore them, or should they take an active role which may involve sacrificing 'the good life' (of good colleges, high salaries and big walls)?Should the United States pull its troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan and risk ""a shattered Iraq, a hopeless Afghanistan and a nuclear Iran""? Or should America continue to put their boys in the firing line, up the tempo and seek to annihilate the rebel forces and the 'Tali' (ban - get it?) once and for all? Are good and brave Americans who enlist for military action being stupid and throwing their futures away, like lions led by lambs? Or would it be better to seek alternative routes of engagement, until one is drafted into the army?Can one disagree with another's patriotic actions whilst revering the other's reasons for them? (Can, in fact, motives and actions be so neatly separated?)So you have professors, wise monkeys, counselling young lions not to be led to the slaughter by lambs like the Senators, themselves challenged by elephant-journalists with large memories - whilst the entire jungle is in crisis. Welcome to the circus of life. There are animals everywhere and no one's really sure what's happening, but everyone's hoping there'll be a happy ending. Before we all tear each other apart, limb from bloody limb.A unique movie on political conversations, if ever one was made. Too bad Redford didn't get Cruise to get out of his office. That may have saved it from becoming a 'Ticking Tom Bomb'? As it stands, some scenes should serve well as an intro to a course or seminar of Political Science. Because too bad, no, I don't think your average movie-goer is going to want to spend a few good weekend hours or a tired post-work evening seeing movie-stars (albeit very famous ones) sit and talk.",3,Inconvenient Conversations,1206748800,"03 29, 2008",2008,3994,"['not', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'movie', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'movie', 'barely', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'movie', 'Frankly', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'barely', 'movie', 'wish', 'enjoy', 'must', ""n't"", 'think', 'such', 'let', 'alone', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'L4L', 'best', 'savoured', 'pseudo-documentary', 'not', 'quite', 'like', 'Inconvenient', 'Truth', 'not', 'far', 'away', 'either.In', 'fact', 'film', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'named', 'Inconvenient', 'Talk', 'Inconvenient', 'Topics', 'really', 'about', 'well', 'talking', 'tough', 'topics', 'clear', 'consensus', 'view', 'politics', 'education', 'media', 'role', 'America', 'Americans', 'war', 'terror', 'classroom', 'public', 'knowledge', 'government', 'minorities', 'privileged', 'so', 'on.You', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'professor', 'trying', 'convince', 'possibly', 'brightest', 'student', 'more', 'life', 'just', 'earning', 'degrees', 'growing', 'rich', 'take', 'crises', 'Iraqi', 'war', 'possibly', 'echoing', 'Redford', 'personal', 'view', 'younger', 'generation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sit', 'back', 'blame', 'hopeless', 'politicians', 'people', 'America', 'have', 'got', 'do', 'something', 'two', 'other', 'students', 'take', 'view', 'what', 'extreme', 'position', 'actualling', 'signing', 'up', 'fight.These', 'two', 'students', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'Negro', 'also', 'form', 'other', 'key', 'segment', 'show', 'snow-battle', 'mountains', 'Afghanistan', 'resulting', 'very', 'poorly', 'planned', 'US', 'military', 'op', 'fiasco', 'was', 'turn', 'brainchild', 'Senator', 'Jasper', 'Irving', 'played', 'boyish', 'gusto', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'poster', 'child', 'American', 'Republican', 'politics', 'who', 'right', 'things', 'most', 'tough', 'questions', 'huge', 'grin', 'Irving', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'character', 'journalist', 'do', 'exclusive', 'new', 'military', 'strategy', 'process', 'tense', 'debate', 'failures', 'futures', 'American', 'foreign', 'policy', 'context', 'war', 'terror.L4L', 'arguments', 'Back', 'forth', 'back', 'forth', 'one', 'big', 'plurivocal', 'textbook', 'played', 'out', 'motion', 'picturesque.Should', 'Americans', 'be', 'indifferent', 'should', 'apologise', 'should', 'curse', 'politicians', 'who', 'never', 'say', 'anything', 'never', 'stop', 'talking', 'who', 'keep', 'repeating', 'am', 'NOT', 'running', 'President', 'ignore', 'should', 'take', 'active', 'role', 'may', 'involve', 'sacrificing', 'good', 'life', 'good', 'colleges', 'high', 'salaries', 'big', 'walls', 'Should', 'United', 'States', 'pull', 'troops', 'Iraq', 'Afghanistan', 'risk', 'shattered', 'Iraq', 'hopeless', 'Afghanistan', 'nuclear', 'Iran', 'Or', 'should', 'America', 'continue', 'put', 'boys', 'firing', 'line', 'up', 'tempo', 'seek', 'annihilate', 'rebel', 'forces', ""'Tali"", 'ban', 'get', 'once', 'Are', 'good', 'brave', 'Americans', 'who', 'enlist', 'military', 'action', 'being', 'stupid', 'throwing', 'futures', 'away', 'lions', 'led', 'lambs', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'seek', 'alternative', 'routes', 'engagement', 'one', 'drafted', 'army', 'Can', 'one', 'disagree', 'patriotic', 'actions', 'whilst', 'revering', 'other', 'reasons', 'Can', 'fact', 'motives', 'actions', 'be', 'so', 'neatly', 'separated', 'have', 'professors', 'wise', 'monkeys', 'counselling', 'young', 'lions', 'not', 'be', 'led', 'slaughter', 'lambs', 'Senators', 'challenged', 'elephant-journalists', 'large', 'memories', 'whilst', 'entire', 'jungle', 'crisis', 'Welcome', 'circus', 'life', 'are', 'animals', 'everywhere', 'one', 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'happening', 'everyone', 'hoping', 'there', ""'ll"", 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'tear', 'other', 'apart', 'limb', 'bloody', 'limb.A', 'unique', 'movie', 'political', 'conversations', 'ever', 'one', 'was', 'made', 'Too', 'bad', 'Redford', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Cruise', 'get', 'office', 'may', 'have', 'saved', 'becoming', ""'Ticking"", 'Tom', 'Bomb', 'scenes', 'should', 'serve', 'well', 'intro', 'course', 'seminar', 'Political', 'Science', 'too', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'average', 'movie-goer', 'going', 'want', 'spend', 'few', 'good', 'weekend', 'hours', 'tired', 'post-work', 'evening', 'seeing', 'movie-stars', 'albeit', 'very', 'famous', 'ones', 'sit', 'talk']",Lions for Lambs Theatrical Release
1118519,A3H7RMK1GNWU3K,B000YDJG0I,"Amazon Customer ""hybridboy""","[4, 7]","Let's sum this movie up because that is what a review is for correct?Very well done.This movie was made with several intentions in mind, unfortunately the general public is all too quick to pick a side and they miss the point of the film entirely.You have all aspects of politicians in this movie you have the senator (Tom Cruise) GOP baby moving up in the ranks, trying to make his mark.  You have the Liberal Professor (Redford) and you have the voice to the sheep of the country the media (Streep.)For those of you that stated it is one sided I don't know how many more sides you need because that is what the War is about.  Everyone is fed exactly what they need to eat, nothing more, nothing less it is up to the individual to determine if they like the taste.This was an excellent movie about how America is losing its place in the world concerning itself with the Middle East.

For what reason are the lambs doing this? Only (ONLY!) for their own political image. By no means do these politicians actually care about the safety of their country...only about what will get them elected next time.So who are the heroes in this film? The soldiers and...the media. As director Robert Redford tells it; the media take the twisted lies and propaganda that the right-wing politicians are spewing and straighten it out to the stories that we read in the paper. Alright, great.Meryl Streep plays the reporter, who was one of the people who fell prey to the ""terrible lies"" that followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks regarding who was responsible. She is interviewing Tom Cruise, a politician who the audience is obviously supposed to dislike.Here's the problem(s).This is a propoganda piece! Now, propoganda isn't neccasarily bad, but Streep's climatic rant toward the end of the film makes a valid point against the film itself. When questioned why she doesn't want to print the story given by Cruise's character, Streep says that ""all he gave was propoganda."" In other words, she argued that she wouldn't be printing NEWS, she would be printing a piece of biased propoganda. That is essentially what this movie is.This is not a debate for a certain view...it is mere propoganda masquerading as a provocotive look at the debate behind the Iraq War. When you can make your opponent say whatever you want so that you can come up with some clever retort, it isn't exatly valid debate.Bottom line; Do not be fooled...this is Redford's bitter views spun into an angering propoganda piece.

I also believe this movie is ideal for those who appreciate solid acting, especially on the part of Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep.The storyline is... actually it's divided into three separate stories, each one focusing on the political side of the spectrum.It's pretty weird at first how the movie keeps jumping around between the three stories, but eventually you'll adjust to the approach the movie writers are going for. It's weird, but it works.Two of the stories are definitely more interesting than the third. The one involving Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise's character having detailed (though somewhat cool and rational) conversations focusing on the war in Afghanistan is definitely the best of the three storylines (plus they frequently mention Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries, keeping things relevant to the real world).The other storyline where you see the actual fighting take place over in Afghanistan is probably the second best of the three stories, however, what strikes me as disappointing is the fact that the entire war scene in Afghanistan involving the two soldiers who were on ground and forced to fight for their lives took place at night with snow blowing around, so you couldn't really SEE any of the fighting taking place. This has been a problem with many Hollywood movies as of late- having great difficulty actually seeing the action for whatever reason.The very end of the film involving the two soldiers is a VERY emotional moment, and probably the best part of the film.I didn't quite get the significance of the third storyline involving the college student having a classroom conversation with his teacher, unless the meaning is that ""you're young, things change as you get older, so do what you love while you're still young"".Now, I'm going to be honest here- I'm not someone who normally follows politics, at least, not on a deep level where I feel the need to keep myself up to date every single day on the events taking place around the world. I do watch the news, I do read about many other countries and problems all the time, and I make sure I'm always at least aware what's going on in the world.However, someone who follows politics on a frequent basis may find much of the storytelling in Lions for Lambs predictable, and nothing they haven't seen before. My logic is- if I can follow along to the storyline easily, someone who's heavy and extremely knowledgeable on politics probably will think the movie isn't that great.I really liked Lions for Lambs, but the film is only recommended if politics are something you have a not-so detailed interest in.",5,highly enjoyable,1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,2722,"[""'re"", 'only', 'mildly', 'interested', 'political', 'movies', 'focus', 'war', 'Middle', 'East', 'will', 'love', 'movie', 'also', 'believe', 'movie', 'ideal', 'who', 'appreciate', 'solid', 'acting', 'especially', 'part', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Meryl', 'Streep.The', 'storyline', 'actually', 'divided', 'three', 'separate', 'stories', 'one', 'focusing', 'political', 'side', 'spectrum.It', 'pretty', 'weird', 'first', 'how', 'movie', 'jumping', 'around', 'three', 'stories', 'eventually', ""'ll"", 'adjust', 'approach', 'movie', 'writers', 'are', 'going', 'weird', 'stories', 'are', 'definitely', 'more', 'interesting', 'third', 'one', 'involving', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'character', 'having', 'detailed', 'somewhat', 'cool', 'rational', 'conversations', 'focusing', 'war', 'Afghanistan', 'definitely', 'best', 'three', 'storylines', 'frequently', 'mention', 'Iraq', 'other', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'countries', 'keeping', 'things', 'relevant', 'real', 'world', 'other', 'storyline', 'where', 'see', 'actual', 'fighting', 'take', 'place', 'Afghanistan', 'probably', 'second', 'best', 'three', 'stories', 'however', 'what', 'disappointing', 'fact', 'entire', 'war', 'scene', 'Afghanistan', 'involving', 'two', 'soldiers', 'who', 'were', 'ground', 'forced', 'fight', 'lives', 'took', 'place', 'night', 'snow', 'blowing', 'around', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'SEE', 'fighting', 'taking', 'place', 'been', 'problem', 'many', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'late-', 'having', 'great', 'difficulty', 'actually', 'seeing', 'action', 'reason.The', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'involving', 'two', 'soldiers', 'VERY', 'emotional', 'moment', 'probably', 'best', 'part', 'film.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'significance', 'third', 'storyline', 'involving', 'college', 'student', 'having', 'classroom', 'conversation', 'teacher', 'meaning', ""'re"", 'young', 'things', 'change', 'get', 'older', 'so', 'do', 'what', 'love', ""'re"", 'still', 'young', '.Now', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'honest', 'here-', ""'m"", 'not', 'someone', 'who', 'normally', 'politics', 'least', 'not', 'deep', 'level', 'where', 'feel', 'need', 'keep', 'up', 'date', 'single', 'day', 'events', 'taking', 'place', 'world', 'do', 'watch', 'news', 'do', 'read', 'many', 'other', 'countries', 'problems', 'time', 'make', 'sure', ""'m"", 'always', 'least', 'aware', 'what', 'going', 'world.However', 'someone', 'who', 'politics', 'frequent', 'basis', 'may', 'find', 'much', 'storytelling', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'predictable', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'logic', 'is-', 'can', 'follow', 'along', 'storyline', 'easily', 'someone', 'who', 'heavy', 'extremely', 'knowledgeable', 'politics', 'probably', 'will', 'think', 'movie', ""n't"", 'great.I', 'really', 'liked', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'film', 'only', 'recommended', 'politics', 'are', 'something', 'have', 'not-so', 'detailed', 'interest']",Lions for Lambs Theatrical Release

1118525,APA0I244WQDJ8,B000YDJG0I,"B. Kopenhaver ""Ephesians 6:12""","[2, 5]","The film Lions for Lambs is an honest attempt to portray the spicy geopolitical climate in its raw, unedited and costly truth. The film takes place in three films, one between two brother's in arms, another between a student and his teacher and another between a journalist and a pathocratic senator. Each vignette offers an illuminating look at the reality of our situation, and I mean our because each one of us can somehow fit into the film itself.The brother's in arms are interestingly, two previous students of the professor we're introduced to. We're shown their military adventure in Afghanistan as they attempt to fulfill a new strategy issued by the senator. Their characters are bold, courageous, and strong-willed. They have an incredible power of conscience, and a desire to do what is right. Their failing? They lack accurate psychological knowledge of the men who lead them. They are Lions for Lambs.The pathocratic senator is played exceedingly well by Tom Cruise. I'd never thought I'd enjoy his performance as much as I did in this film. He shows a psychopathic ability to mix words, to tug on a normal man's emotions, to lie with the cunning conviction he is right, more then that - that he is righteous - because he possesses a pathological nature that prevents him from seeing, thinking or believing otherwise. The journalist who shares his entire vignette is played by Meryl Streep, and her desire to honestly do her job and do it right comes through strong. She is invited by the senator for an hour to discuss the 'new strategy' in Afghanistan, and to help relay it to the public. She does an excellent job of asking the questions anyone of conscience would ask, and we can see Cruises' character's pathology if we pay attention.The last vignette is between Robert Redford, who plays a professor at an unnamed California University and a student of his that shows much promise. The student has potential, but feels as if he'd be happier with a 'normal life', keeping his head down, getting a good job, and making the best out of his life without trying to play a big role in world events. He makes a good argument, but is countered by experience, wisdom and an understanding which he cannot quite grasp due to his youth. For the greater part of the interaction we're not even sure if an impact is made, if his armor is dented, but there is hope reflected in the very last scene that makes the entire bit worth it.The core of the film is a display of the reality of our situation here in America. Our politicians are self-serving, lying, pathological monsters who are irredeemable and incapable of change. The establishment that is Mainstream Media is saturated with people who are solely 'doing their job' or so they think, by reporting what they are told - propaganda or not. Some of them are damn good people, who have a strong conscience, but due to circumstance (mostly age and financial obligations) cannot change. Their potential to be something different has dried up.Then we are shown the best and the brightest. Two out of three of which ended up believing their abilities would best be used serving this country in it's war effort. They had the conscience, the dedication and the will to do something new, bold and dramatic - but they didn't have the knowledge that would have allowed their effort to really make an impact, and the results are given to us dramatically.The third student is a wild card, we're really not sure what he does by the end of the film, but we're given hope that he may attempt something great - to succeed or fail matters not, but that he may attempt it gives us hope. In my mind I saw all of us as that third student. Young, smart, definitely lazy and more interested in social life and girls then knowledge and wisdom which would allow him to fight to change the world. He is the future, the potential future, it exists only as a potential because it is possible, but extremely difficult to manifest. It can only happen with dedication, conscience, and knowledge - which are much more difficult to acquire then a video game, television show, sports event or event a really hot lay.That is the core of the film, if we want to make an impact, to make positive changes to our world, to become our potential as individuals and as a society we have to want it, we have to try for it, and we have to make it a daily effort.",5,"An honest attempt to portray our reality, as it is.",1215388800,"07 7, 2008",2008,4379,"['film', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'honest', 'attempt', 'portray', 'spicy', 'geopolitical', 'climate', 'raw', 'unedited', 'costly', 'truth', 'film', 'place', 'three', 'films', 'one', 'two', 'brother', 'arms', 'student', 'teacher', 'journalist', 'pathocratic', 'senator', 'vignette', 'illuminating', 'look', 'reality', 'situation', 'mean', 'one', 'can', 'somehow', 'fit', 'film', 'brother', 'arms', 'are', 'interestingly', 'two', 'previous', 'students', 'professor', ""'re"", 'introduced', ""'re"", 'shown', 'military', 'adventure', 'Afghanistan', 'attempt', 'fulfill', 'new', 'strategy', 'issued', 'senator', 'characters', 'are', 'bold', 'courageous', 'strong-willed', 'have', 'incredible', 'power', 'conscience', 'desire', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'failing', 'lack', 'accurate', 'psychological', 'knowledge', 'men', 'who', 'lead', 'are', 'Lions', 'Lambs.The', 'pathocratic', 'senator', 'played', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'Tom', 'Cruise', ""'d"", 'never', 'thought', ""'d"", 'enjoy', 'performance', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'film', 'psychopathic', 'ability', 'mix', 'words', 'tug', 'normal', 'man', 'emotions', 'lie', 'cunning', 'conviction', 'right', 'more', 'then', 'righteous', 'pathological', 'nature', 'seeing', 'thinking', 'believing', 'otherwise', 'journalist', 'who', 'shares', 'entire', 'vignette', 'played', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'desire', 'honestly', 'do', 'job', 'do', 'right', 'strong', 'invited', 'senator', 'hour', 'discuss', ""'new"", 'strategy', 'Afghanistan', 'help', 'relay', 'public', 'excellent', 'job', 'asking', 'questions', 'anyone', 'conscience', 'would', 'ask', 'can', 'see', 'Cruises', 'character', 'pathology', 'pay', 'last', 'vignette', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'who', 'professor', 'unnamed', 'California', 'University', 'student', 'much', 'promise', 'student', 'potential', 'feels', ""'d"", 'be', 'happier', ""'normal"", 'life', 'keeping', 'head', 'down', 'getting', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'best', 'life', 'trying', 'play', 'big', 'role', 'world', 'events', 'good', 'argument', 'countered', 'experience', 'wisdom', 'understanding', 'can', 'not', 'quite', 'grasp', 'due', 'youth', 'greater', 'part', 'interaction', ""'re"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'impact', 'made', 'armor', 'dented', 'hope', 'reflected', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'entire', 'bit', 'worth', 'it.The', 'core', 'film', 'display', 'reality', 'situation', 'here', 'America', 'politicians', 'are', 'self-serving', 'lying', 'pathological', 'monsters', 'who', 'are', 'irredeemable', 'incapable', 'change', 'establishment', 'Mainstream', 'Media', 'saturated', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'solely', ""'doing"", 'job', 'think', 'reporting', 'what', 'are', 'told', 'propaganda', 'not', 'are', 'damn', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'strong', 'conscience', 'due', 'circumstance', 'mostly', 'age', 'financial', 'obligations', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'potential', 'be', 'something', 'different', 'dried', 'are', 'shown', 'best', 'brightest', 'Two', 'three', 'ended', 'up', 'believing', 'abilities', 'would', 'best', 'be', 'used', 'serving', 'country', 'war', 'effort', 'had', 'conscience', 'dedication', 'will', 'do', 'something', 'new', 'bold', 'dramatic', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'knowledge', 'would', 'have', 'allowed', 'effort', 'really', 'make', 'impact', 'results', 'are', 'given', 'dramatically.The', 'third', 'student', 'wild', 'card', ""'re"", 'really', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'end', 'film', ""'re"", 'given', 'hope', 'may', 'attempt', 'something', 'great', 'succeed', 'fail', 'matters', 'not', 'may', 'attempt', 'hope', 'mind', 'saw', 'third', 'student', 'Young', 'smart', 'definitely', 'lazy', 'more', 'interested', 'social', 'life', 'girls', 'then', 'knowledge', 'wisdom', 'would', 'allow', 'fight', 'change', 'world', 'future', 'potential', 'future', 'only', 'potential', 'possible', 'extremely', 'difficult', 'manifest', 'can', 'only', 'happen', 'dedication', 'conscience', 'knowledge', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'difficult', 'acquire', 'then', 'video', 'game', 'television', 'show', 'sports', 'event', 'event', 'really', 'hot', 'lay.That', 'core', 'film', 'want', 'make', 'impact', 'make', 'positive', 'changes', 'world', 'become', 'potential', 'individuals', 'society', 'have', 'want', 'have', 'try', 'have', 'make', 'daily', 'effort']",Lions for Lambs Theatrical Release
1118526,A30TQET02FLSUX,B000YDJG0I,BLACKBOXBLUE,"[0, 1]","Lions For Lambs (2007) was a movie I was anxious to see when I heard about it several years ago before it was released. But then it got bad reviews and I shifted it to my DVDs To Watch list. Finally getting around to it recently, I felt the movie was average (3 stars out of 5). I have enormous respect for Robert Redford and love many of his movies, but this was not one of his better efforts in my opinion. I think the script lacked emotional connection and originality. It was too dry and journalistic for my taste. I do think the acting was good by the supporting cast, but headliners Robert Redford, Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep were all lacking in their performances...and they were the main reasons I was attracted to this movie originally. Cruise simply plays a character that doesn't fit him and it showed. He's stiff and unbelievable in his role as a Republican Senator. Same with Streep as a news reporter I think. And while Redford's teacher did fit him, he simply didn't have enough good scenes and enough depth within the overall story to make up for the rest.

I actually think 30 more minutes should have been added to the film with much more emphasis on the two young enlisted men fighting in Afghanistan and less time on the lecture Robert Redford gives to one of his college students.When the United States is at war, the party in power has to continually spin the story to keep the American public engaged, to frame every event to the advantage of the United States, to simplify every confrontation into good versus evil, and to cover up all the vest interests such as defense contractors that keep the war machine moving. I think Tom Cruise did an outstanding job as a GOP Senator trying to put a new spin on a bogged down situation in Afghanistan.  Anyone who has studied world history knows that Afghanistan is the quick sand black hole of the great powers and England, the USSR, and the United States have all been sucked into this country of tribes and warlords and ever shifting allegiances and resources. Cruise does an admirable job of trying to convince veteran reporter Meryl Streep that this is something new, somehow a light in the forest that will help America defeat the enemy and leave as victors. Of course Streep does not buy it, she realizes we are fighting ghosts and an enemy that can disappear into the villages and crowds without detection. Of course her superiors in the news industry ask her not to analyze the information, just report on the information. Redford is a college political science professor. He has a powerful presence and his idealism shines through his pores, but he gives too long a lecture and I fear that he loses the audience with too many words.

Whether they were lovers is another matter, left to one's imagination. Why do I come to this conclusion? It's based on a pattern of events. First body language. These two men are extremely comfortable being in close proximity to each other. In the college debate scene both young men were in perfect sync when speaking.  They  make a major life change together when they decide to join the army. On the helicopter they are joyously playing agility games with their hands. When one falls out of the helicopter at a great height, the other consciously decides to jump out after him. Most importantly, their final dramatic scene  is downright romantic! How many of us would give up our lives in such a way unless we were in love? To put it mildly, this is a brave and gutsy film!This provocative story is also a call to action! I'm personally afraid of our current Executive Branch of the Federal government. Something that dampens my enthusiasm for political action.  I believe we Americans are being ruled by a bunch of lunatics with agendas we will never totally understand. While the dialog between the smart aleck college student and the wizened professor is more about this student's contempt and cynicism, reading between the lines, it's also about fear. Fear of failure, fear of the unknown, fear of getting hurt, even fear of wasting one's time.

Robert Redford, one of the film industry's leading liberal voices, returns to the director's chair for the first time in seven years (2000'sThe Legend of Bagger Vancewas his last) with this 2007 drama written as a three-pronged polemic by Matthew Michael Carnahan (The Kingdom). Carnahan's intentionally didactic screenplay is full of eloquent arguments, but the film's structure points to the movie's chief limitation, which is that the characters are only there to present opposing points of view. The net effect feels more like a civics lesson, especially for two of the three plot threads. The third attempts to translate those political arguments to the actual war zone, but somehow, the night scenes on an isolated hilltop don't make the impact necessary to make the rest of the film resonate.The first storyline consists of an interview and ensuing debate between charismatic Senator Jasper Irving, a defiantly pro-war Republican hawk on an obvious Presidential track, and Janine Roth, a veteran, Lesley Stahl-like journalist he personally chose to reveal a new offensive the U.S. military is taking in Afghanistan against the Taliban. Their thrust-and-parry conversation is the best part of the movie, but it leads to the weakest part, a meltdown Roth has with her editor over the way the media shapes public opinion on the war without taking any responsibility to end it. The second plot thread involves an early-morning conversation between Professor Stephen Malley, a liberal academic teaching political science, and Todd Hayes, an obviously bright but disaffected student. They uncover Todd's reasons for apathy which stirs Malley to motivate the young slacker toward activism on any scale. The third storyline ties Malley to two former students, Ernest Rodriguez and Arian Finch, best friends both on scholarship, who heed the professor's advice by enlisting. This troubles Malley deeply, and the two are subsequently sent to Afghanistan to be part of the offensive described by Irving in the first storyline.Tom Cruise is ideally cast as Irving since he has already proven he can convey pending malevolence with surprising conviction. As Roth, Meryl Streep is solid even as the script makes periodic pokes at her character's age. As an actor, Redford appears terrifically engaged as Malley, blurring the line between actor and character to maximum effect. Derek Luke, Michael Pe&ntilde;a and Andrew Garfield are effective in the younger roles. Mark Isham's stirring score is a good match for the gravity of the subject. Even though it's clear that Carnahan's screenplay is designed to raise more questions than it answers, the movie feels strangely incomplete, overly calculated and predictably emphatic despite the earnest intentions. To Redford's credit, the movie doesn't take sides, but it doesn't really finish making a compelling case toward political activism either. His meticulous commentary track is the chief extra on the 2008 DVD, as Redford goes through not only production details but also plot points with precision. There is also a twenty-minute featurette, ""The Making of Lions for Lambs"" which follows the movie from script to casting to production.

1118541,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B000YDJG0I,Erik North,"[7, 10]","A lot has been said about actor/director Robert Redford's film LIONS FOR LAMBS, that it is nothing more than a 100 minute-long political science class wrapped up on celluloid.  Indeed, this is a film that relies on acting, dialogue, and story more than a lot of films that have come out in the last few years, not counting documentaries.  But maybe something like this is needed in Hollywood now: a film driven by acting, dialogue, and story more than mere action sequences, bloodshed, and smart-ass quips.  And since we are dealing with the central issue confronting America today--the War On Terror (or what it has either evolved or devolved into), that makes LIONS FOR LAMBS an impressive piece of American theater.The film traces three different paths.  One involves a very cynical national TV news reporter (Meryl Streep) being given the job of selling a new plan to somehow finally help ""win"" the War On Terror by a very persuasive up-and-coming neoconservative Senator (Tom Cruise).  The second one involves a university professor (Redford) trying to encourage a bright but slacking student of his (Andrew Garfield) to get involved in the political process before his apathy eats him alive by relating how two previous students in his debate class put their money where their mouths were.  The third path involves those two students (Michael Pena; Derek Luke) who, as Army rangers, find themselves in Afghanistan pinned down by machine gun fire emanating from Taliban fighters on a snow-covered mountain after their chopper goes down in a storm.As laid out by Redford and screenwriter/co-producer Matthew Michael Carnahan, LIONS FOR LAMBS makes it a point, through sharp dialogue, to remind us once again, as John Lennon once said, that ""apathy isn't it; we can do something.""  For both Pena and Luke, it means putting their lives on the line for the larger causes of freedom and democracy, even when it has long since become clear that the motivating factor is really kind of pointless.  For Streep, it means getting straight answers, even if her subject is someone who won't give anything but roundabout ones.  For Redford's university professor, it means motivating students into doing positive things to change the world and challenge authority.  And for Cruise, it means staying true to his ideology, however far removed from reality that ideology may be.It's not too terribly surprising that Redford, because of his liberal political beliefs, would be accused of taking a liberal position in this film; it wouldn't be the first time (as ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN or THE CANDIDATE would seem to indicate).  Nor is it too hard to believe that those who would accuse him of such a bias either have not seen LIONS FOR LAMBS or have no intention of doing so but just want to attack the film for the sake of attacking it.  I felt that he did a very even-handed job of showing us both the liberal and the conservative side of the issues surrounding our War On Terror--that it isn't a simple matter of black and white, right and wrong; that taking a stand is not a mere slogan; and that having any kind of extremist ideology can blind us to the mistakes we have made in fighting this war, and the mistakes yet to be made.Cruise does an extremely cutting job of portraying a neoconservative senator in the film; indeed, I would compare this performance to other fine actors of liberal political slants who do good jobs playing characters who are their polar opposites--Burt Lancaster in SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, and Sterling Hayden in DOCTOR STRANGELOVE.  Streep is at her usual best as the cynical TV reporter who sees our conduct in the War On Terror as a hopeless situation; and Redford never ceases to be persuasive in his own way.LIONS FOR LAMBS definitely isn't a film for those more interested in bloodshed and testosterone.  But for those looking for what used to make Hollywood films great, namely acting, dialogue, and story, this gets a film and unequivocal recommendation from me.",5,Getting Involved,1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,3988,"['lot', 'been', 'said', 'actor/director', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'film', 'LIONS', 'FOR', 'LAMBS', 'nothing', 'more', '100', 'minute-long', 'political', 'science', 'class', 'wrapped', 'up', 'celluloid', 'Indeed', 'film', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'story', 'more', 'lot', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'not', 'counting', 'documentaries', 'maybe', 'something', 'needed', 'Hollywood', 'now', 'film', 'driven', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'story', 'more', 'mere', 'action', 'sequences', 'bloodshed', 'smart-ass', 'quips', 'are', 'dealing', 'central', 'issue', 'confronting', 'America', 'today', 'War', 'Terror', 'what', 'evolved', 'devolved', 'LIONS', 'FOR', 'LAMBS', 'impressive', 'piece', 'American', 'theater.The', 'film', 'traces', 'three', 'different', 'paths', 'One', 'very', 'cynical', 'national', 'TV', 'news', 'reporter', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'being', 'given', 'job', 'selling', 'new', 'plan', 'somehow', 'finally', 'help', 'win', 'War', 'Terror', 'very', 'persuasive', 'up-and-coming', 'neoconservative', 'Senator', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'second', 'one', 'university', 'professor', 'Redford', 'trying', 'encourage', 'bright', 'slacking', 'student', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'get', 'involved', 'political', 'process', 'apathy', 'eats', 'alive', 'relating', 'how', 'two', 'previous', 'students', 'debate', 'class', 'put', 'money', 'where', 'mouths', 'were', 'third', 'path', 'two', 'students', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'who', 'Army', 'rangers', 'find', 'Afghanistan', 'pinned', 'down', 'machine', 'gun', 'fire', 'emanating', 'Taliban', 'fighters', 'snow-covered', 'mountain', 'chopper', 'down', 'storm.As', 'laid', 'out', 'Redford', 'screenwriter/co-producer', 'Matthew', 'Michael', 'Carnahan', 'LIONS', 'FOR', 'LAMBS', 'point', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'remind', 'once', 'again', 'John', 'Lennon', 'once', 'said', 'apathy', ""n't"", 'can', 'do', 'something', 'Pena', 'Luke', 'putting', 'lives', 'line', 'larger', 'causes', 'freedom', 'democracy', 'even', 'when', 'long', 'become', 'clear', 'motivating', 'factor', 'really', 'kind', 'pointless', 'Streep', 'getting', 'straight', 'answers', 'even', 'subject', 'someone', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'roundabout', 'ones', 'Redford', 'university', 'professor', 'motivating', 'students', 'doing', 'positive', 'things', 'change', 'world', 'challenge', 'authority', 'Cruise', 'staying', 'true', 'ideology', 'however', 'far', 'removed', 'reality', 'ideology', 'may', 'be.It', 'not', 'too', 'terribly', 'surprising', 'Redford', 'liberal', 'political', 'beliefs', 'would', 'be', 'accused', 'taking', 'liberal', 'position', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'first', 'time', 'THE', 'PRESIDENT', 'MEN', 'THE', 'CANDIDATE', 'would', 'seem', 'indicate', 'too', 'hard', 'believe', 'who', 'would', 'accuse', 'bias', 'either', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'LIONS', 'FOR', 'LAMBS', 'have', 'intention', 'doing', 'so', 'just', 'want', 'attack', 'film', 'sake', 'attacking', 'felt', 'did', 'very', 'even-handed', 'job', 'showing', 'liberal', 'conservative', 'side', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'War', 'Terror', ""n't"", 'simple', 'matter', 'black', 'white', 'right', 'wrong', 'taking', 'stand', 'not', 'mere', 'slogan', 'having', 'kind', 'extremist', 'ideology', 'can', 'blind', 'mistakes', 'have', 'made', 'fighting', 'war', 'mistakes', 'yet', 'be', 'made.Cruise', 'extremely', 'cutting', 'job', 'portraying', 'neoconservative', 'senator', 'film', 'indeed', 'would', 'compare', 'performance', 'other', 'fine', 'actors', 'liberal', 'political', 'slants', 'who', 'do', 'good', 'jobs', 'playing', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'polar', 'opposites', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'SEVEN', 'DAYS', 'IN', 'MAY', 'Sterling', 'Hayden', 'DOCTOR', 'STRANGELOVE', 'Streep', 'usual', 'best', 'cynical', 'TV', 'reporter', 'who', 'conduct', 'War', 'Terror', 'hopeless', 'situation', 'Redford', 'never', 'be', 'persuasive', 'own', 'way.LIONS', 'FOR', 'LAMBS', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'film', 'more', 'interested', 'bloodshed', 'testosterone', 'looking', 'what', 'used', 'make', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'great', 'namely', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'story', 'film', 'unequivocal', 'recommendation']",Lions for Lambs Theatrical Release

1118544,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000YDJG0I,Grady Harp,"[56, 70]","LIONS FOR LAMBS as a movie has the courage to do just what the message of the film attempts to do: encourage the American public to stop being so apathetic about our position in the global community.  The dramatization of three points of view about the Middle East conflicts (it not only takes on the Iraq debacle, but adds the Afghanistan and Iran problems as well) could, in lesser hands than Robert Redford's direction of Matthew Michael Carnahan's script, be a preachy bore.  But while the 'action' of the film may not grab the viewer, the afterburn of the message will haunt the thinking person.Three scenarios interweave (at times a bit bumpy in the editing, and at times a bit distracting): adamantly pro-war Republican Senator Irving (Tom Cruise) is interviewed by veteran 'thinking' journalist Janine Roth (Meryl Streep) and each defends/attacks the current strategy of the war in Iraq (Irving is taking calls about the latest 'expansion' into Afghanistan); Professor Malley (Robert Redford) tries to resurrect a sense of involvement in a student Todd Hayes (Andrew Garfield) once bright but now sinking into the apathy of living the good life; ex-students of Professor Malley - Arian Finch (Derek Luke) and Ernesto Rodriguez (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) - have committed to the idea of acting for change and have ended up being dropped in Afghanistan in the very 'new' war Senator Irving is addressing.  By stirring these three approaches to the manner in which the public is  currently addressing the war in Iraq in a concurrent conversation, the film involves the viewer in the crossfire of apathy and misinformation that come from failed education, faulty governmental intervention and the media sellout to get ratings.  It is not a pretty picture, but then our current state of affairs is not one of which we can be proud.There are no answers here, just harsh realities and questions as to why  we can remain so passive as a nation involved in the lowest state of global respect ever known. The film has flaws, but if the viewer can digest the information illustrated by some very fine acting, perhaps there may be a chance for a wake-up call.  Watch it for the message, not expecting a thriller or an action movie.  The mind is what is engaged here.

A lot of people will not 'get' this movie (clearly, when reading some of the other reviews).It wasn't supposed to be another Hollywood entertainment piece without substance. And it is not preaching anything. What Robert Redford does do here, is point out the apathy and ignorance of many Americans who chose to takes the path of least resistance in life, while others fight around the world for what they believe in. While they continue to die, we are microwaving our TV dinners at home. (THINK about it).In addition, the film highlights current political agendas, corporate cultures and consumerism in the news rooms, where political propagandas are transferred from politicians to TV without commentary or (valuable) discussion. (Fox news is not valuable discussion, in case you didn't know. Neither is the daily show by the way!).The ""news"" as it stands today, is really a part of the entertainment industry, rather than researched perspective and political engagement. Dead soldiers in Iraq are talked about in the same segment as Anna Nicole Smith's baby and Paris Hilton's dog.

In retrospective style we will witness two students assuming a public posture in a clever exposition of ideas and ideals, though they have chosen to enlist in the Army.The muscle is represented by the Army, where ironically these young citizens collide, to experience in live flesh the horror of a strategic default, a non foreseen incident or an undesirable collateral damage, when they fall on enemy territory in the heights of a snowy mountain in Afghanistan.You should see this movie with first rate attention, because its narrative time overcomes by far, its physical time; there's abundant food for thought all the way through, despite of the fact the narrative structure is based on ""Babel"".A tour de force film that will make you to think days and even weeks after you have seen it.",5,Brain and muscle !,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",2008,2165,"['work', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'far', 'most', 'ambitious', 'thoughtful', 'incisive', 'project', 'take', 'look', 'previous', 'achievements.This', 'smart', 'script', 'presents', 'different', 'perspectives', 'sensible', 'issue', 'brutal', 'devastating', 'conflict', 'good', 'part', 'reflections.Four', 'scenarios', 'four', 'positions', 'four', 'defined', 'points', 'view', 'brain', 'represented', 'Senator', 'Irving', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'firmly', 'convinced', 'new', 'strategy', 'must', 'prevail', 'sustained', 'rational', 'wing', 'wide', 'sector', 'pragmatism', 'decision', 'makings', 'sit', 'desk', 'comfortable', 'office.On', 'other', 'side', 'trench', 'have', 'sensitive', 'clever', 'worried', 'journalist', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'who', 'required', 'make', 'interview', 'out', 'ethical', 'confrontation', 'plans', 'practical', 'results', 'years', 'smart', 'strategies', 'war', 'hard', 'die', 'convictions', 'are', 'loomed', 'order', 'preserve', 'dignity', 'proud', 'Western', 'hemisphere', 'inquisitive', 'responses', 'arguments', 'exposed', 'journalist.The', 'nerve', 'symbolized', 'idealistic', 'professor', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'counterpart', 'mirror', 'image', 'opinion', 'brilliant', 'still', 'immature', 'teenager', 'Andrew', 'Gardfield', 'who', 'criticizes', 'even', 'meaning', 'role', 'world', 'retrospective', 'style', 'will', 'witness', 'two', 'students', 'assuming', 'public', 'posture', 'clever', 'exposition', 'ideas', 'ideals', 'have', 'chosen', 'enlist', 'Army.The', 'muscle', 'represented', 'Army', 'where', 'ironically', 'young', 'citizens', 'collide', 'experience', 'live', 'flesh', 'horror', 'strategic', 'default', 'non', 'foreseen', 'incident', 'undesirable', 'collateral', 'damage', 'when', 'fall', 'enemy', 'territory', 'heights', 'snowy', 'mountain', 'Afghanistan.You', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'first', 'rate', 'attention', 'narrative', 'time', 'overcomes', 'far', 'physical', 'time', 'abundant', 'food', 'thought', 'way', 'fact', 'narrative', 'structure', 'based', 'Babel', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'days', 'even', 'weeks', 'have', 'seen']",Lions for Lambs Theatrical Release

Since Hollywood has conditioned us to eschew movies with lengthy dialogue and strong mission statements--unlike many other forms of creative narrative like Greek drama, the works of G. B. Shaw, or B. Brecht--it will be hard for many viewers to actually sit still to listen to a ten minute conversation between a college professor (Rob Redford) and a student, during a meeting in his office.  However, if the film gets rid of at least some of the spider webs that obfuscate our thinking, it will have accomplished something few films demonstrate: that the U.S. has been transformed into the ultimate disposable consumer culture: young people are disposable in the eyes of our adminstration that is too cowardly to try something that takes effort: that is thought and understanding about geopolitics.  The lambs, the executive branch and the senate myrmidons--using a quote from Churchill throw its young lions into battle with the knowledge that they and their loved ones are safe behind a veneer of lies and ambition.  Unfortunatley the two protagonists who decide to enlist in the army to fight for America even knowing the mission might not be the right one have misplaced allegiances. A far more patriotic act on their part would be to go to a local gun store, and put a couple of slugs to the heads of our executives.

1118552,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000YDJG0I,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 6]","This is one of the strangest film we can imagine about the end of Dubya's war on terror, alas not the end of the war per se. It is all centered on Afghanistan but it is essentially conveyed in the paranoid fear of human beings. Like the Christian God, this story is based on three characters, three story tellers, three episodes that overlap and crisscross from one to the other constantly. On one side a university professor who was drafted into the Vietnam war and has not yet really understood what happened then. He has negotiated a hypocritical peace with life that makes him take his anger and frustration onto the students themselves in order to confront them to decision making at any time in their life as students when this life has become boring and senseless. They know it is not going to be better than their parent's though the latter have promised them it would. And anyway, and that is what these students have forgotten, it cannot be the same, let alone better because they are just starting in life and nothing in life is given ready made and ready to eat. You have to fight for it, like it or not, and that the dear professor has forgotten it in his own mind, even if the students have forgotten it in their real life. The professor makes the students fight but for the sake of it not for any commitment, even purely selfish. The professor does not do his job since he does not teach them how to start from zero, as life requires it for 95% of people, and then have an objective other than satisfying the wants, desires or phantasms of the professor. He is not even a signpost along the road that never follows the road it is indicating, but he is a signpost in the middle of the desert pointing in any erratic direction according to the moment and the professor's impulses. The journalist in a big newspaper is confronted with  the necessity, or even the duty, to tell the public that everyone is lying to them and they believe them. But she runs out of steam to convince other people, out of steam to really corner the senator who receives her, out of steam to convince her own boss about that necessity instead of treating everything as news when it is only propaganda. She too is sort of out of phase and she will either yield or retire. She is incapable of doing her job for her boss who takes the assignment away, her job being to bring news to the public. But she is also incapable to do what she thinks her job is, that is to say bring people to reflecting and having a wider vision on things, a vision that could integrate the past into the future and vice versa, in other words be responsible and visionary. The senator is a young wolf who is ready to win the war whatever the cost  it may take because that's what politicians need, a win. Instead of drawing the conclusion from the failure that the mistakes are too heavy for life to forgive and forget them and that politicians have to stop these mistakes, they want more war and they look for the person who is going to be able to carry the message to the people and make people swallow the hard medicine instead of changing it altogether. In that trilogy - or should I say trinity? - of lost grown-ups, the film shows a few young students and how they react to this fake life, and it is not at all encouraging.  These students are lost. Whether they want to commit themselves and their life to the big battle against terrorism but they are betrayed by a bunch of incompetent officers and politicians who will announce their death as a victory. Or they want to stay out of it and enjoy life and that makes them drop-outs for one and flunkies for two. No hope there, hence a deep sense of despair. The dice have been cast and no one can decipher the message written among the dots and figures. Two years later what can we think about it? It will take a lot of energy - and hope - on the side of politicians to change their ways. It will take a lot of energy for the people to understand enjoying life cannot be the objective of life itself. It will take a lot of energy for the media to understand that their job is not to transmit the press releases of politicians but to educate and enlighten the public into thinking with their own heads. It will take a lot of energy, though I am afraid this battle is far from even having begun, for professors and teachers, educators and intellectuals to get down into the world and commit themselves to real life, which would mean more work and less ease for them, the poor darlings, my heart is bleeding for them. To defend their privileges, these professors and company are ready to break the life of their students as students and then as grown-ups and even as citizens, and they will argue that the students agree.

It's pure liberal propaganda, a documentary buried in the look, but never reality of story within it's 3 interlaced pretences at stories.  A ""story"" has literary elements, (say, ""rules of engagment"") including character, plot, setting, denoument, climax, any one of which missing renders it mere chatter.  This offered only character, opinionated characters, poorly developed.I recently read some Hollywood somebody defending such a story as this, claiming that life has no climaxes or endings, so such stories are more realistic.  I can only pity the one who views life in such a way.  All lives DO end, and all choices lead to denouments and climaxes, whether the individual wishes to graph his own or not.  Those who spend theirs ""looking for themselves,"" and whining, ""What's it all about?"" while seeking escape in whatever poison they chose, are simply not living as God intends.  The life that is not worth dying for was not worth living.Who could care what happened to any of these characters, other than the 2 on the battlefield, and they were far from realistic, behaving out of character for special forces fighters.The clue as to where it was headed, which was nowhere, should have been obvious from its title, but unfortunately many viewers (self included) may not thought deeply about the title prior to watching.If a viewer wants to waste time, assuming a viewer who actually has followed the politics of the past decade, this is a good one to watch.

1118563,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B000YDJG0I,Mark Turner,"[5, 9]","I started out watching this movie expecting to hate it. I'd heard all about how it was a one sided, liberal view of the ongoing war in the Middle East. Knowing Robert Redford's politics I expected nothing less. But then it pulled me in. That is until it summed up towards the end.The movie has three converging stories that all meld into one. The first involves charismatic politician Senator Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise) who is giving a one on one interview with journalist Janine Roth (Meryl Streep). The interview is an attempt to get the press to work with Irving who is behind a new push in Afghanistan. While slick, Irving has to be the bad guy because we see news headlines about how the GOP is losing popularity (though our current congress is at an all time low in popularity and not run by the GOP) and pictures of him with everyone from President Bush to Condeleza Rice.The second story revolves around a college student (Andrew Garfield) and his political science teacher (Redford). Redford sees great potential in this student who has a come what may attitude towards life. To convince him of his potential, Redford tells him the story of two other students, our third story.The other two students are Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pena) and Arian Finch (Derek Luke), a Mexican American and black American, who got where they were in school via scholarships. They have chosen to join the armed forces to take a stand and try and change things from the inside. Both are involved in this new push and have been stranded behind enemy lines in Afghanistan.Each of these stories revolves around one simple idea. That the war in the Middle East is wrong and has been wrong and always will be wrong. Granted it never says this statement out loud, but that IS what the central story is about.It's also about the choices we make and how they affect more than ourselves. Choices to stand for what we believe, to sit back and watch the world go by, to enhance an already volatile situation or to offer up a truth spun to us rather than seek the reality behind the story. Unfortunately for this film, it tries to represent each side of the story using only one.An intellectual discussion on the topic would find merit in both sides because in truth it exists. But this movie espouses to do so while propagandizing only one. Each point of view made is done so with nothing more than the same rhetoric used over and over again to make a case. An example: the current war we find ourselves in is NOT Vietnam and never will be no matter how hard people want to draw comparisons. No two wars are alike no matter how many people want them to be. But this movie falls back on that comparison on more than one occasion.The film is well made, don't get me wrong. It looks tremendous. The acting is top notch (with the exception of Streep who never convinced me of her character). It feels like a great Hollywood movie. I began by enjoying it but ended feeling like I had heard this same story over and over again and always from someone unwilling to look at both sides of an issue. And that being what was trying to be told here made it a failure in so many ways.If you buy into the rhetoric, you'll love this movie. If you don't, it will make you angry. And if you can at least, honestly, go into with an open mind, you'll walk away thinking perhaps they need more open minded people to make both sides heard.  This movie died at the box office.

Unfortunately, it is a tedious, preachy film that seems more designed to deliver a message than to entertain; it winds up doing neither well.There are three distinct storylines going on, all taking place over a period of an hour in different regions of the world.  In California, Robert Redford is a political science professor debating an apathetic student about political activism during the former's office hours.  There is no plot, just a bunch of back-and-forth arguing.  Meanwhile, two of Redford's former students - who actually followed his call to participate, though not in the way he intended - are now Special Forces soldiers trapped on a mountaintop in Afghanistan after a mission went wrong.  This is the only storyline that is minimally interesting, probably because it is the only one with any real action in it.The third storyline involves a Republican senator played by Tom Cruise giving an interview to reporter Meryl Streep.  The purpose of their meeting is to unveil the purpose of the Afghanistan mission, which Cruise does not yet know has gone wrong.  The interview, however, turns into a debate about the United States's efforts in the Middle East, and it is grating to watch.  The attempt to provide a semblance of balance fails:  Cruise's pro-war stance is so filled with cliched lines - and he comes off too glib - that he is utterly unbelievable.  Streep isn't much better on her side.From a political standpoint, I actually agree with a lot of what this movie says, but it does it so poorly that it undermines its own cause.  I often say I can enjoy a good book or movie even if I disagree with its politics, as long as it's done well; similarly, I can hate a book or movie that I agree with if it's done bad, as this one is.

Well, this movie aims for that, but alas merely reaches the heights of `Yeah, it's worth watching...'.The film revolves around 3 storylines, essentially taking place simultaneously, and in real time, but this structure is not religiously adhered to as there are also some flashbacks.  In Washington, a senior Senator rumored to be a potential Presidential candidate, invites a respected journalist from a major TV news network, to give her an exclusive on the latest tactics being used in Afghanistan.  Meanwhile, that push is shown through the eyes of two soldiers in the Special Forces, as the mission goes wrong and they are stuck behind enemy lines.  The final strand is in a University, as the professor Robert Redford talks to a student full of potential but with more than enough cynicism and apathy to go with it.  He shares his experience with the story of the two Special Forces soldiers, who were students of his and left to `go make a difference'.It's a movie brimming with talent to be sure, with Robert Redford directing and Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep acting their socks off..  Cruise does give a compellingly convincing portrayal of a senior politician, convinced of his moral high ground but using it to further his career as much or if not more than doing the right thing.  Streep also gives a performance which at times seems just a little too self consciously rounded, when something stripped down to basics would have done just as well.  Her tics and mannerisms would have been better served in a movie which focused on her character.  Redford is.. well, simply Redford.The script, when we hear the characters debating with each other (which is most of the movie - don't go expecting an action flick whatever you do..) is intelligent and gets across its message clearly enough.  Engagement is needed - apathy is a recipe for disaster, whether it be apathy on an individuals part or on the part of the media.  Clumsy parallels to Vietnam are made.  However, we don't have time to warm to any of the characters, neither are arcs to the characters developed, such that the movie ultimately feels like a lecture - something that a documentary could have done as well - or even better, using actual facts instead of drama.Worth watching for some good performances and literate script, but should have been much more.

First and foremost, I believe that this movie gave very little technical realism to the military side of the equation.  Once again, we're portrayed as macho idiots (or lambs) that are saluting smartly and doing the bidding of senseless Republican war-mongers who do ""whatever it takes.""  The technical aspects of the military mission were laughable.  Anyone that falls or jumps out of a helicopter 100 feet above mountainous terrain is going to DIE.  Yet, one of our college heroes falls out and the other jumps out so that ""no man is left behind"" and they survive the fall into a snow bank on a flat part of the mountain pass.  Next, Hollywood shows us that we can see our good guys with the bad guy ""Talies"" approaching via satellite imagery through a blinding snow storm at night...right.  So, we watch our intrepid heroes fight off some of the advance of some 20-30 enemy while having little or no terrain as cover.  Why are our heroes not killed outright?....We are told that the Taliban want to take them alive.  OK, maybe plausible, but unlikely.  Next, our A-10 support arrives and bombs the crap out of the FLOT (forward line of troops) at least two or three times.  Initially our heroes hope that all have been vanquished, but then suffer further small arms fire from the dark only yards away.  What do they decide?  Do they decide to try to hold on for what everyone knows will be the rescue attempt?  NOOOOOO.  Damn it.  They stand up and go out in a suicide blaze of fire because they believe all is lost.  CRAP!  Seconds later the remaining Taliban are exterminated in the final A-10 pass and the rescue helicopter only a couple of minutes away.  I was so angry I could spit.  The rest of the movie is what you would expect from Robert Redford, another lecture on his view of American politics and right wing wrongs.

With all the excellent independent films he has viewed through his Sundance film festival, I thought ""Lions for Lambs"" would do a better job of dissecting the sorts of narratives we receive from the establishment.  So, it was disappointing to see the Afghani fighters portrayed as amorphous blobs on the screen, set in a scenario where the audience is to cheer for their destruction (that is, kill the ""other"" before the two likeable American boys are killed).  U.S. soldiers are portrayed as pure and heroic, Afghani soldiers are evil blobs.  This is the sort of narrative that entrenches a superiority complex in the American mind.  Even if U.S. soldiers are as wonderful as the characters in this movie are, they are carrying out policies designed by Machiavellian warlords of the U.S. empire who are much worse than the Republican politician played by Tom Cruise.  Superpowers don't invade countries to bring democracy, they invade to procure resourcesGas War: The Truth Behind the American Occupation of Afghanistanand open marketsThe Bush Agenda: Invading the World, One Economy at a Time.To the extent the Taliban are pathological, they exhibit pathologies that we and the Russians createdBleeding Afghanistan: Washington, Warlords, and the Propaganda of Silence (Open Media).This film would've been much more interesting if the Afghani soldiers received some character development, instead of just caricature.

The college student character is typical of many young people who have been politically neutralized.  College is financially out of reach for many (an economic pressure that induces many into our ""volunteer"" army), those who do enter higher ed are often saddled with enormous debtIn Debt We Trust, while others are part of the upper class and aren't particularly concerned about foreign policyAmusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business.For another perspective on U.S. militarism, I'd recommendWhy We Fight.""It is part of the general pattern of misguided policy that our country is now geared to an arms economy which was bred in an artificially induced psychosis of war hysteria and nurtured upon an incessant propaganda of fear.  While such an economy may produce a sense of seeming prosperity for the moment, it rests on an illusionary foundation of complete unreliability and renders among our political leaders almost a greater fear of peace than is their fear of war."" - General Douglas MacArthur, speech of 1951, quoted inTotal Insecurity: The Myth of American Omnipotenceby Carol Brightman",3,"Some points missed, but alright.",1217462400,"07 31, 2008",2008,3189,"['Redford', 'directed', 'film', 'probably', 'set', 'expectations', 'too', 'high', 'meet', 'excellent', 'independent', 'films', 'viewed', 'Sundance', 'film', 'festival', 'thought', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'would', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'dissecting', 'sorts', 'narratives', 'receive', 'establishment', 'So', 'was', 'disappointing', 'see', 'Afghani', 'fighters', 'portrayed', 'amorphous', 'blobs', 'screen', 'set', 'scenario', 'where', 'audience', 'cheer', 'destruction', 'kill', 'other', 'two', 'likeable', 'American', 'boys', 'are', 'killed', 'U.S.', 'soldiers', 'are', 'portrayed', 'pure', 'heroic', 'Afghani', 'soldiers', 'are', 'evil', 'blobs', 'sort', 'narrative', 'superiority', 'complex', 'American', 'mind', 'Even', 'U.S.', 'soldiers', 'are', 'as', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'are', 'carrying', 'out', 'policies', 'designed', 'Machiavellian', 'warlords', 'U.S.', 'empire', 'who', 'are', 'much', 'worse', 'Republican', 'politician', 'played', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Superpowers', 'do', ""n't"", 'invade', 'countries', 'bring', 'democracy', 'invade', 'procure', 'resourcesGas', 'War', 'Truth', 'American', 'Occupation', 'Afghanistanand', 'open', 'marketsThe', 'Bush', 'Agenda', 'Invading', 'World', 'One', 'Economy', 'Time.To', 'extent', 'Taliban', 'are', 'pathological', 'exhibit', 'pathologies', 'Russians', 'createdBleeding', 'Afghanistan', 'Washington', 'Warlords', 'Propaganda', 'Silence', 'Open', 'Media', '.This', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'Afghani', 'soldiers', 'received', 'character', 'development', 'instead', 'just', 'caricature', 'were', 'considered', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'one', 'point', 'being', 'aided', 'funded', 'U.S.', 'being', 'received', 'White', 'HouseTerrorism', 'Theirs', 'OursAfghan', 'Guerrilla', 'Warfare', 'Words', 'Mujahideen', 'Fighters.As', 'citizens', 'world', 'hyperpower', 'maybe', 'should', 'consider', 'losses', 'other', 'side', 'instead', 'just', 'losses', 'imperial', 'aggression', 'usHow', 'America', 'Gets', 'Away', 'Murder', 'Illegal', 'Wars', 'Collateral', 'Damage', 'Crimes', 'Against', 'Humanity.Aside', 'criticism', 'movie', 'have', 'thoughtful', 'dialogue', 'college', 'student', 'character', 'typical', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'politically', 'neutralized', 'College', 'financially', 'reach', 'many', 'economic', 'pressure', 'many', 'volunteer', 'army', 'who', 'do', 'enter', 'higher', 'ed', 'are', 'often', 'saddled', 'enormous', 'debtIn', 'Debt', 'Trust', 'others', 'are', 'part', 'upper', 'class', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'concerned', 'foreign', 'policyAmusing', 'Death', 'Public', 'Discourse', 'Age', 'Show', 'Business.For', 'perspective', 'U.S.', 'militarism', ""'d"", 'recommendWhy', 'Fight', 'part', 'general', 'pattern', 'misguided', 'policy', 'country', 'now', 'geared', 'arms', 'economy', 'was', 'bred', 'artificially', 'induced', 'psychosis', 'war', 'hysteria', 'nurtured', 'incessant', 'propaganda', 'fear', 'such', 'economy', 'may', 'produce', 'sense', 'seeming', 'prosperity', 'moment', 'illusionary', 'foundation', 'complete', 'unreliability', 'renders', 'political', 'leaders', 'almost', 'greater', 'fear', 'peace', 'fear', 'war', 'General', 'Douglas', 'MacArthur', 'speech', '1951', 'quoted', 'inTotal', 'Insecurity', 'Myth', 'American', 'Omnipotenceby', 'Carol', 'Brightman']",Lions for Lambs Theatrical Release

The Germans were most impressed with the Brit soldiers' fighting ability, but they didn't particularly respect the men who commanded them. Essentially, unblooded, starched collar men were setting objectives for a war they knew nothing about.""Lions for Lambs"" takes place over a very short period of time--less than a day in three separate scenarios. It opens with Janine Roth (Meryl Streep), a veteran reporter of 40 years, being granted an exclusive one on one hour with Senator Jasper Irving.  In the interview, the Senator extols that Ms. Roth help him sell a new initiative for the US war with Afghanistan. This initiative had begun 10 minutes before their interview commenced. Essentially, the US Forces in Afghanistan are going to use small point insertion of troops to break the enemy's back--very similar to the plan General Abrams used in Viet Nam. Can the Senator get Ms. Roth's support for this new plan and sell it to the US people?Next, we see Prof Steven Malley (Robert Redford) talking with Todd (Andrew Garfield, a student from his political science class. He offers Todd a deal--either accept a blue collar B for A work and non-attendance or entertain a proposition. Why did he offer it?  Because Todd was one of the few students who showed true potential and encouraging those people to do something with their lives was why Malley still taught college. Can he convince Todd to enter the program he's suggesting?The final set of people we see are two students Prof Malley mentioned in his talk with Todd. Ernest Rodriguez (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) and Arian Finch (Derek Luke) are two of the US Special Forces unit who are parachuting into Afghanastan to ""show the enemy the full measure of American mean."" Their helocopter is fired on due to poor intelligence and Rodriguez is knocked out of the craft. Arian follows him in the jump--to stay with his 'brother' in both arms and spirit. The damaged helo has to leave due to the continued fire. Can Command get a chopper back in time to rescue the two brave soldiers?These are the basic questions involving the three groups of people, but of course there's more discourse than that.  Essentially, the Senator's and Professor's portions of the film are all talk and the two soldiers' are mostly action. Redford manages to entwine the three storylines almost flawlessly.

1118579,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000YDJG0I,Roland E. Zwick,"[12, 19]","**1/2""Lions For Lambs,"" director Robert Redford's all-star dissertation on life in a post-9/11, ""War on Terror""-dominated world (and easily the most sermonizing movie since ""Crash""), takes place in three entirely separate locales: a United States senator's office in Washington D.C., an unnamed university campus in California, and a remote, snow-covered hillside in rural Afghanistan.In the first setting, Tom Cruise plays a smarmy Republican lawmaker who has decided to grant an exclusive briefing to a seasoned political reporter (Meryl Streep) regarding a new military strategy the Americans are implementing in Afghanistan.  In the second sphere, Redford is a veteran political science professor who is trying to convince a bright but deeply cynical student to overcome his apathy and to become actively engaged in the political process.  Finally, Michael Pena and Derek Luke are two of the professor's former students who a few years earlier decided to put their lives on the line by joining some special op forces and who are currently trapped behind enemy lines after the helicopter on which they are riding comes under intense artillery fire while on a mission.Thoughtful and timely political discourse is such a rare commodity on American screens these days that one feels downright ungrateful for not responding more positively to Redford's film.  Matthew Michael Carnahan's screenplay comes with an obviously liberal slant, but it does try more than most to be reasonably fair-minded in the points it is making and to see things from a multiplicity of angles.  The problem is that, for all its good intentions, the film comes across more like a TV or radio debate than a full-fledged fictional drama.  Redford's talking-heads directorial style results in a series of static mini lectures, virtually devoid of passion, cohesion or drama.  How can Redford expect the audience to get all worked up and agitated about the issues he's presenting when he himself seems to be having so much trouble doing so?The didactic tone leaves very little room for any actual character development, with the people in the film functioning as little more than convenient mouthpieces for the writer and director.  This is a shame because the movie has some cogent points to make about patriotism, political apathy, materialism, celebrity culture, the government's use of fear and paranoia in manipulating the masses, and the responsibility a free press has in exposing corruption and deceit, particularly in a time of national crisis.  Yet, the movie itself is so academic, inert, and talky that whatever issues it is raising get submerged in the tedium.  Oddly, the movie has a clunky disjointedness that one generally encounters in films adapted from stage plays, even though the screenplay in this case is apparently an original creation.In the role of actor, Redford comes across as smug and condescending as the professor, while Todd Hayes exhibits zero charisma as the supposedly brilliant boy whose soul Redford seems intent on saving (or, at least, kick-starting into the future).  Cruise and Streep play off each other well in the scenes they have together, and it's especially interesting watching Streep portraying a character who is the antithesis of the one she plays in the similarly-themed (but much better) ""Rendition.""  Pena and Luke are given far too little screen time to make much of an impression as the two lads who demonstrate their patriotism through actions rather than mere words.One could live with the movie's preachiness if the film itself were at least well done, but ""Lions For Lambs"" fails because it commits the one unpardonable sin of dramaturgy - it places its story at the service of the message rather than the other way around.  Thus, instead of a work of art, what we get is a piece of well-intentioned agitprop - a high class poli sci lesson in place of a compelling movie.",2,a star-studded poli sci lesson,1194652800,"11 10, 2007",2007,3905,"['**1/2', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'director', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'all-star', 'dissertation', 'life', 'post-9/11', 'War', 'Terror', '-dominated', 'world', 'easily', 'most', 'sermonizing', 'movie', 'Crash', 'place', 'three', 'entirely', 'separate', 'locales', 'United', 'States', 'senator', 'office', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'unnamed', 'university', 'campus', 'California', 'remote', 'snow-covered', 'hillside', 'rural', 'Afghanistan.In', 'first', 'setting', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'smarmy', 'Republican', 'lawmaker', 'who', 'decided', 'grant', 'exclusive', 'briefing', 'seasoned', 'political', 'reporter', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'regarding', 'new', 'military', 'strategy', 'Americans', 'are', 'implementing', 'Afghanistan', 'second', 'sphere', 'Redford', 'veteran', 'political', 'science', 'professor', 'who', 'trying', 'convince', 'bright', 'deeply', 'cynical', 'student', 'overcome', 'apathy', 'become', 'actively', 'engaged', 'political', 'process', 'Finally', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'are', 'two', 'professor', 'former', 'students', 'who', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'decided', 'put', 'lives', 'line', 'joining', 'special', 'op', 'forces', 'who', 'are', 'currently', 'trapped', 'enemy', 'lines', 'helicopter', 'are', 'riding', 'intense', 'artillery', 'fire', 'mission.Thoughtful', 'timely', 'political', 'discourse', 'such', 'rare', 'commodity', 'American', 'screens', 'days', 'one', 'feels', 'downright', 'ungrateful', 'not', 'responding', 'more', 'positively', 'Redford', 'film', 'Matthew', 'Michael', 'Carnahan', 'screenplay', 'obviously', 'liberal', 'slant', 'try', 'more', 'most', 'be', 'reasonably', 'fair-minded', 'points', 'making', 'see', 'things', 'multiplicity', 'angles', 'problem', 'good', 'intentions', 'film', 'more', 'TV', 'radio', 'debate', 'full-fledged', 'fictional', 'drama', 'Redford', 'talking-heads', 'directorial', 'style', 'results', 'series', 'static', 'mini', 'lectures', 'virtually', 'devoid', 'passion', 'cohesion', 'drama', 'How', 'can', 'Redford', 'expect', 'audience', 'get', 'worked', 'up', 'agitated', 'issues', 'presenting', 'when', 'be', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'doing', 'so', 'didactic', 'tone', 'very', 'little', 'room', 'actual', 'character', 'development', 'people', 'film', 'functioning', 'little', 'more', 'convenient', 'mouthpieces', 'writer', 'director', 'shame', 'movie', 'cogent', 'points', 'make', 'patriotism', 'political', 'apathy', 'materialism', 'celebrity', 'culture', 'government', 'use', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'manipulating', 'masses', 'responsibility', 'free', 'press', 'exposing', 'corruption', 'deceit', 'particularly', 'time', 'national', 'crisis', 'movie', 'so', 'academic', 'inert', 'talky', 'issues', 'raising', 'get', 'submerged', 'tedium', 'Oddly', 'movie', 'clunky', 'disjointedness', 'one', 'generally', 'films', 'adapted', 'stage', 'plays', 'even', 'screenplay', 'case', 'apparently', 'original', 'creation.In', 'role', 'actor', 'Redford', 'across', 'smug', 'condescending', 'professor', 'Todd', 'Hayes', 'zero', 'charisma', 'supposedly', 'brilliant', 'boy', 'soul', 'Redford', 'intent', 'saving', 'least', 'kick-starting', 'future', 'Cruise', 'Streep', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'well', 'scenes', 'have', 'together', 'especially', 'interesting', 'watching', 'Streep', 'portraying', 'character', 'who', 'antithesis', 'one', 'similarly-themed', 'much', 'better', 'Rendition', 'Pena', 'Luke', 'are', 'given', 'far', 'too', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'make', 'much', 'impression', 'two', 'lads', 'who', 'demonstrate', 'patriotism', 'actions', 'rather', 'mere', 'words.One', 'could', 'live', 'movie', 'preachiness', 'film', 'were', 'least', 'well', 'done', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'one', 'unpardonable', 'sin', 'dramaturgy', 'story', 'service', 'message', 'rather', 'other', 'way', 'Thus', 'instead', 'work', 'art', 'what', 'get', 'piece', 'well-intentioned', 'agitprop', 'high', 'class', 'poli', 'sci', 'lesson', 'place', 'compelling', 'movie']",Lions for Lambs Theatrical Release

A conventional ""plot"" is conspicuous by its absence, about 80% of the film is polarized chitchat, and it throws more questions into the fray than pat answers. Caveat emptor.If, on the other hand, the idea of witty back-and-forth on issues very germane in this day and age does not make you want to run back to Seinfeld reruns, here's a taut script packed to the gunnel with some gloriously insouciant dialogue.We follow three separate strands of it. Tom Cruise plays a presidential hopeful (but, in customary irony, he emphatically denies ever wanting to be one) who has engineered a secret new war strategy to tame the new kind of enemy that lurks overseas. The dubiously labeled ""forward operating points"", we learn. He announces this ever so speciously to a veteran reporter, played by Meryl Streep. Two soldiers, played superbly by Michael Pe&ntilde;a and Derek Luke, implement those new orders and land in serious peril. That's the second thread with actual combat action. In parallel, Redford completes the trifecta as a political science professor in ""a California university"", down but not out by the apathy of students, trying to galvanize one of them who is drifting from studies.All talk and no play could make Jack a dull boy. But Redford's assured direction has the clip and the pizazz to make the static seem kinetic. Streep and Cruise electrify simple banter about popularity polls and botched invasions that feel like they took place last month. There's a liberal dollop (pun intended) of wit and erudition to her talk. As though spurred by her refined touch, Tom Cruise is on a ""Magnolia""-caliber roll, bringing a creepy charisma to a senator clearly in love with the heft of his role.Surprising, too, is how equal the newcomer Andrew Garfield is to the task of countering Redford as the wayward student whose surfer dude mannerisms conceal a keen mind. On occasion, this professor-pupil talk makes for the worst kind of dialectic--a dry and cliched public service announcement more than clever drama. But thankfully just when we are about to check our watches, we are rescued by provocative interludes of US soldiers stranded in the inclement peaks of Afghanistan. Al Qaeda's militants are depicted as shadowy creatures, literally, which is a touch disingenuous but it's not hard to overlook. The two former students who joined the US army bring enough chemistry to their roles to add an emotional edge.But to me, therein lies the biggest ham in the script: the portrayal of these hard-working scholarship boys who trundle off into war zones because they want to do ""good"". There's been a tendency in recent years to aggrandize the common soldier which, while properly laying the blame on the political management, risks offering an unrealistic look at the experience of war. RememberJarhead? Ultimately, these are scared kids lost in a foreign country, a reminder of the human life put at risk by high ideals and political sloganeering. Ahem, Mr. Redford.As a critique of modern politics, however, it plays an even hand. Cruise's senator's assertions hark back to the now-(in)famous Tony Blair speech that gave a short shrift to evidence, vaguely acknowledges past mistakes while repeating them, and displays bafflement for the adversaries who refuse to play by his rules. But Streep's reporter isn't fully devoid of blame either, compromised by the media's early cheer-leading for the Iraq War and her inability to effectively question the party line.It's rare to see a high-profile movie out of mainstream Hollywood that goes so far out of its way to include everyone, not just the like-minded. It may smack of armchair moralizing, but boring it is not. And unlike some other recent films such as Rendition, which I nonetheless enjoyed, it isn't preachy either. Instead, to coin a phrase, it's urgeful: whatever you believe, please do something about it.A timely message wrapped in delightful theater.",4,"""SO SAYS THE MAN IN THE AIRCONDITIONED ROOM""",1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,4154,"['are', 'restive', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'ignoring', 'War', 'Terror', 'films', 'droves', 'patter', 'perspectives', 'usually', 'found', 'stage', 'plays', 'not', 'bag', 'then', 'let', 'say', 'first', 'up', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'not', 'conventional', 'plot', 'conspicuous', 'absence', 'about', '80', '%', 'film', 'polarized', 'chitchat', 'more', 'questions', 'fray', 'pat', 'answers', 'Caveat', 'emptor.If', 'other', 'hand', 'idea', 'witty', 'back-and-forth', 'issues', 'very', 'germane', 'day', 'age', 'not', 'make', 'want', 'run', 'back', 'Seinfeld', 'reruns', 'here', 'taut', 'script', 'packed', 'gunnel', 'gloriously', 'insouciant', 'dialogue.We', 'follow', 'three', 'separate', 'strands', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'presidential', 'hopeful', 'customary', 'irony', 'emphatically', 'ever', 'wanting', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'engineered', 'secret', 'new', 'war', 'strategy', 'tame', 'new', 'kind', 'enemy', 'overseas', 'dubiously', 'labeled', 'forward', 'operating', 'points', 'learn', 'ever', 'so', 'speciously', 'veteran', 'reporter', 'played', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Two', 'soldiers', 'played', 'superbly', 'Michael', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'implement', 'new', 'orders', 'land', 'serious', 'peril', 'second', 'thread', 'actual', 'combat', 'action', 'parallel', 'Redford', 'trifecta', 'political', 'science', 'professor', 'California', 'university', 'down', 'not', 'out', 'apathy', 'students', 'trying', 'galvanize', 'one', 'who', 'drifting', 'studies.All', 'talk', 'play', 'could', 'make', 'Jack', 'dull', 'boy', 'Redford', 'assured', 'direction', 'clip', 'pizazz', 'make', 'static', 'seem', 'kinetic', 'Streep', 'Cruise', 'electrify', 'simple', 'banter', 'popularity', 'polls', 'botched', 'invasions', 'feel', 'took', 'place', 'last', 'month', 'liberal', 'dollop', 'pun', 'intended', 'wit', 'erudition', 'talk', 'spurred', 'refined', 'touch', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Magnolia', '-caliber', 'roll', 'bringing', 'creepy', 'charisma', 'senator', 'clearly', 'love', 'heft', 'role.Surprising', 'too', 'how', 'equal', 'newcomer', 'Andrew', 'Garfield', 'task', 'countering', 'Redford', 'wayward', 'student', 'surfer', 'dude', 'mannerisms', 'conceal', 'keen', 'mind', 'occasion', 'professor-pupil', 'talk', 'worst', 'kind', 'dialectic', 'dry', 'cliched', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'more', 'clever', 'drama', 'thankfully', 'just', 'when', 'are', 'check', 'watches', 'are', 'rescued', 'provocative', 'interludes', 'US', 'soldiers', 'stranded', 'inclement', 'peaks', 'Afghanistan', 'Al', 'Qaeda', 'militants', 'are', 'depicted', 'shadowy', 'creatures', 'literally', 'touch', 'disingenuous', 'not', 'hard', 'overlook', 'two', 'former', 'students', 'who', 'joined', 'US', 'army', 'bring', 'enough', 'chemistry', 'roles', 'add', 'emotional', 'edge.But', 'biggest', 'ham', 'script', 'portrayal', 'hard-working', 'scholarship', 'boys', 'who', 'trundle', 'off', 'war', 'zones', 'want', 'do', 'good', 'been', 'tendency', 'recent', 'years', 'aggrandize', 'common', 'soldier', 'properly', 'laying', 'blame', 'political', 'management', 'risks', 'offering', 'unrealistic', 'look', 'experience', 'war', 'RememberJarhead', 'Ultimately', 'are', 'scared', 'kids', 'lost', 'foreign', 'country', 'reminder', 'human', 'life', 'put', 'risk', 'high', 'ideals', 'political', 'sloganeering', 'Ahem', 'Mr.', 'Redford.As', 'critique', 'modern', 'politics', 'however', 'even', 'hand', 'Cruise', 'senator', 'assertions', 'hark', 'back', 'now-', 'famous', 'Tony', 'Blair', 'speech', 'gave', 'short', 'shrift', 'evidence', 'vaguely', 'past', 'mistakes', 'repeating', 'displays', 'bafflement', 'adversaries', 'who', 'refuse', 'play', 'rules', 'Streep', 'reporter', ""n't"", 'fully', 'devoid', 'blame', 'compromised', 'media', 'early', 'cheer-leading', 'Iraq', 'War', 'inability', 'effectively', 'question', 'party', 'line.It', 'rare', 'see', 'high-profile', 'movie', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'far', 'way', 'include', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'like-minded', 'may', 'smack', 'armchair', 'moralizing', 'boring', 'not', 'other', 'recent', 'films', 'such', 'Rendition', 'nonetheless', 'enjoyed', ""n't"", 'preachy', 'either', 'Instead', 'coin', 'phrase', 'urgeful', 'believe', 'please', 'do', 'something', 'it.A', 'timely', 'message', 'wrapped', 'delightful', 'theater']",Lions for Lambs Theatrical Release

It is a film dealing with all of the issues of our current Goverment. Take a look at how ""Lions for Lambs"" deals with the Iraq war...and the flak that both senators and journalists deal with...and you can find it all here. A good education,right?The answer to that question is right:halfway right. With ""Lions for Lambs"",Robert Redford(the first person to knock the Oscar out of Martin Scorsese's hands,I might add)does a very good job at taking three seperate lives(a Senator,a TV journalist,and a professor)and blending them all into one(Redford's character is just a connection to the characters of Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep-you'll see the connection and what I mean). What these three characters deal with and how they get entangled in what is blamed on the Government and the Bush administration-does show the world we live in today(more,though,if you are against the war in Iraq-this is not a film for Iraq war supporters). Robert Redford does open viewers' eyes more a little bit to the career of a senator and a journalist in this current world. That,right there,is very positive and gives ""Lions for Lambs"" a strong,metal ground to stand on.The main problem,though,is that ""Lions for Lambs""(aside from what I already mentioned)is nothing about the Gov. we don't know already. The stuff that doesn't open our eyes and make us understand is what has been running in the headlines. It's the basis of the majority of ""Lions for Lambs"". And,unfortunately,""Lions for Lambs"" does become slow and boring in getting its required expression out not too long after the film has settled in(and that's most of the film). Had LFL been kept at its required pace(Robert Redford and Meryl Streep themselves claimed that they had several problems on the set with Tom Cruise that caused this damage)and been kept at a good and even balance,the news of today might have a little more life summarized better.

1118586,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,B000YDJG0I,Steve,"[2, 3]","Lions for Lambs addresses three areas of our current state of the union. The first is the messianic desire for America being the global and moral police force. Second, the media's morphing from the fourth estate to the fourth branch of government; a complicit enabler of public duping and a whore to ratings and lowest common denominator pandering. Lastly, it delivers a solid punch in the nose to America the Apathetic.While the back and forth between Streep and Cruise plays like all the other left/right debates on any Sunday morning program, the give and take between Redford as a university professor and his increasingly self-centered but once-promising student is well done. Some have complained that Redford lectures, and he does (he is playing a professor...), but his student volleys with equal skill and you hear a debate that is not heard enough; what's the right choice for someone in this land of plenty?America has become so powerful and wealthy that we have people who are poor yet fat, and possess cell phones and flat-screens, thus no desire to change their circumstances. The new ""heroes"" of our society are business-people or entrepreneurs, those nauseatingly-dubbed ""job creators,"" whose overarching goal is not the betterment of society but rather the fattening of their bank account. Those people are enabled by politicians who are equally self-serving and cynical. Furthermore, we have become so spoiled by our excess that we no longer care to improve (and in some cases, if one tries to improve America, their loyalty is called into question) or even perpetuate this experiment called The United States of America, but rather seek to get ours while we can and to hell with the future. Lions for Lambs might not solve all these problems, but it need only start the dialogue and get people to think about more than themselves. Wouldn't that be a huge step in the right direction?

1118589,A3B87UZLPCF0HW,B000YDJG0I,"Tanis ""Tanis Yvonne Somerville""","[3, 6]","An overtly political thought-provoker from old school Hollywood liberalist Robert Redford, Lions For Lambs marks the first feature from the revamped United Artist studio. Exploring the faith of two US soldiers dropped behind enemy lines through three parallel narratives all linked to the two men, Lambs marks an extreme departure for Tom Cruise the actor, as he plays a Machiavellian hotshot Republican senator who gives a one hour interview to Streep's experienced (if somewhat disillusioned) reporter. Meanwhile, Robert Redford's idealistic college professor lectures a potentially brilliant, but lazy student on the dangers of not harnessing his natural leadership skills, by using two of his former students (the two now lost in Afghanistan) as an example of standing for something they truly believed in. Designed purely to poke the waning fires of debate, Lions For Lambs is a powerful film that asks questions not only of the American government, but also its citizens and (most notably) its media. The point here is a simple but staggeringly profound one - if you don't stand for something, then you fall for everything.  Performance-wise, Cruise holds up surprisingly well, as he plays Senator Jasper Irving with a hint of a narcissistic undertone that gives the movie star his best role since just that flick. It may not be the Oscar contender some had predicted, and it may not set the box office alight, but it is an effective catalyst for diplomacy through art, and will surely spark communicative efforts, even amongst the least political viewer. Smart and engaging, with a reflective power, Lions For Lambs is not perfect filmmaking by any means, as it falters slightly around the middle - but it still begs for mass viewings from an information-starved public.",3,Not bad for Cruise---political eye-opener,1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,1777,"['overtly', 'political', 'thought-provoker', 'old', 'school', 'Hollywood', 'liberalist', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'first', 'feature', 'revamped', 'United', 'Artist', 'studio', 'Exploring', 'faith', 'two', 'US', 'soldiers', 'dropped', 'enemy', 'lines', 'three', 'parallel', 'narratives', 'linked', 'two', 'men', 'Lambs', 'extreme', 'departure', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'actor', 'Machiavellian', 'hotshot', 'Republican', 'senator', 'who', 'one', 'hour', 'interview', 'Streep', 'experienced', 'somewhat', 'disillusioned', 'reporter', 'Meanwhile', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'idealistic', 'college', 'professor', 'potentially', 'brilliant', 'lazy', 'student', 'dangers', 'not', 'harnessing', 'natural', 'leadership', 'skills', 'using', 'two', 'former', 'students', 'two', 'now', 'lost', 'Afghanistan', 'example', 'standing', 'something', 'truly', 'believed', 'Designed', 'purely', 'poke', 'waning', 'fires', 'debate', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'powerful', 'film', 'questions', 'not', 'only', 'American', 'government', 'also', 'citizens', 'most', 'notably', 'media', 'point', 'here', 'simple', 'staggeringly', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'something', 'then', 'fall', 'everything', 'Performance-wise', 'Cruise', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'Senator', 'Jasper', 'Irving', 'hint', 'narcissistic', 'undertone', 'movie', 'best', 'role', 'just', 'flick', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'had', 'predicted', 'may', 'not', 'set', 'box', 'office', 'alight', 'effective', 'catalyst', 'diplomacy', 'art', 'will', 'surely', 'spark', 'communicative', 'efforts', 'even', 'least', 'political', 'viewer', 'Smart', 'engaging', 'reflective', 'power', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'not', 'perfect', 'filmmaking', 'means', 'slightly', 'middle', 'still', 'mass', 'viewings', 'information-starved', 'public']",Lions for Lambs Theatrical Release
1118590,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B000YDJG0I,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[2, 4]","Another reviewer at Amazon notes 'it's about getting off your butt', while another here notes 'this isn't for short attention span viewers', and yet... I'm not sure either of those points are quite right about this film.This film is a complex tale with writing that seems to be from the same school as say The West Wing, or Sports Night, or the later Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.  No, this wasn't an Aaron Sorkin tale, but it seems that way, and if you watch the extras and listen to the writer's own words, and those of the actors and actresses that brought those words to life, you see that style very clearly (if you didn't already pick up on it).  Given what the writer seemed to be going for, and what the actors and actresses (and director Robert Redford), they all seem to have delivered, but then the question becomes what have they really delivered?This isn't an anti-war picture, but at the same time it is most certainly not a film that glorifies war or places the military on a pedestal.  Far from it, the military and political leadership rightfully catches blame for the mishandling of the war in Afghanistan.  We're 'treated to' seeing the results of the poor leadership, poor intelligence, and poor planning as it plays out over roughly one third of this film in the form of two special forces soldiers on a mission gone bad.While those events are unfolding 'in real time', we're also looking in at an interview (also occuring in real time) between an aging reporter (played by Meryl Streep) and a young 'hot shot' politician (played by Tom Cruise).  The dialog and banter between Streep and Cruise is crisp and quick, though there isn't the talking over other players that happens quite frequently in the Aaron Sorkin products noted above.  As the interview unfolds, and then is looked at later when Streep goes back to the offices of her big media/entertainment company employer, we learn that Streep wasn't happy with the answers she got from Cruise.  She is placed in a bit of a dilemma as her bosses presses her to take the story she was given and run with it while she feels much less inclined to actually run the story.Finally, while those events have been unfolding in real time, we get the last of events that are also unfolding in a real time as the political science professor played by Robert Redford is having an early morning meeting with an apparent slacker student who holds a lot of promise but just can't seem to engage himself in Redford's classes any more.The film moves back and forth between events in Afghanistan, to the Congressman's office in D.C., to the University in California and as we see flashbacks of past events in the professor's class we find that we are seeing a pair of individuals there who are now heavily involved in events in Afghanistan.What is the message of the film?  Is there even one particular message?  Certainly that 'get off your butt and get involved' message is there, but that isn't the only message and if it was just that message trying to come through in this film there are other films that would seem to do a much better job of passing along that message (see Pay It Forward as an example).Perhaps the message is that politicians are idiots?  Maybe, but again other films would seem to do a better job at telling and showing us that to be the case.Maybe the message is that the news media that have been there and done that are smarter than everyone else and know what will and won't work as they see through the semantics and re-invention of older military strategies that are being brought up by the hot-shot politicians and the military brass.After the fact, the lack of the single message and the complexity of the film may be what hurts the film the most, or at least hurts the film with most potential viewers.  While I rated the film at 4 stars in my review, it is more in the 3-1/2 star range for me (curse you for not allowing 1/2 star ratings Amazon.com!), and I can certainly see where it would be a 2 star (or worse) snooze fest for many or even a 5 star masterpiece for others.  I wish it was a bit easier to consume, but then again do people really want to be beat over the head with the messages and morals from the writers/directors/actors?

Because of his huge success in the ""Mission:Impossible"" films he also became known as an action film actor. So it's nice to see Tom in a film without him shooting a gun and trying to kill the bad guys. In ""Lions For Lambs"" Tom plays a U.S. senator giving an interview to a Washington journalist. He discusses the wars in Iran and Afganistan and his take on how the American government is dealing with the War On Terror.The film actually deals with three separate storylines with the same theme: the first one with Tom's character; the second in which Robert Redford plays a California college professor where he chats with a college student and discovers the young man's opinion on the wars; and lastly we see two young and brave soldiers actually fighting in the wars and their ultimate demise.Critics and fans hated ""Lions For Lambs"" with a passion. I have watched it several times and although it's not Tom Cruise's biggest film it is a thought-provoking and extremely well-written account of one of the most controversial wars in the last 100 years. The movie makes one re-evaluate your own opinions and thoughts on the invasion of Iran and Afganistan, the real reason why these wars started, and should they continue.Robert Redford also directed the film and with a $35,000,000 budget the picture made over $60,000,000, so despite what most say it was a success.",5,"""Very Enjoyable""",1297123200,"02 8, 2011",2011,1444,"['mid', '1990', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'had', 'become', '1', 'box', 'office', 'star', 'world', 'huge', 'success', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'films', 'also', 'became', 'known', 'action', 'film', 'actor', 'nice', 'see', 'Tom', 'film', 'shooting', 'gun', 'trying', 'kill', 'bad', 'guys', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'Tom', 'U.S.', 'senator', 'giving', 'interview', 'Washington', 'journalist', 'wars', 'Iran', 'Afganistan', 'take', 'how', 'American', 'government', 'dealing', 'War', 'Terror.The', 'film', 'actually', 'deals', 'three', 'separate', 'storylines', 'same', 'theme', 'first', 'one', 'Tom', 'character', 'second', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'California', 'college', 'professor', 'where', 'college', 'student', 'young', 'man', 'opinion', 'wars', 'lastly', 'see', 'two', 'young', 'brave', 'soldiers', 'actually', 'fighting', 'wars', 'ultimate', 'demise.Critics', 'fans', 'hated', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'passion', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'not', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'biggest', 'film', 'thought-provoking', 'extremely', 'well-written', 'account', 'one', 'most', 'controversial', 'wars', 'last', '100', 'years', 'movie', 'one', 're-evaluate', 'own', 'opinions', 'thoughts', 'invasion', 'Iran', 'Afganistan', 'real', 'reason', 'why', 'wars', 'started', 'should', 'continue.Robert', 'Redford', 'also', 'directed', 'film', '35,000,000', 'budget', 'picture', 'made', '60,000,000', 'so', 'what', 'most', 'say', 'was', 'success']",Lions for Lambs Theatrical Release
1118592,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000YDJG0I,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[10, 15]","Perceptively enlightened, Robert Redford's political propaganda film ""Lions for Lambs"" loosely translates into smart entertainment. Exceptionally strong acting and fully fleshed characters are unfortunately unable to disguise Redford's opinionated brand of current events, and he often teeters dangerously close to the edge of being an army recruiter. Despite the occasional overbearingly preachy tone, the three steadily converging storylines showcase top-notch direction and allow clever dialogue fodder for the always enjoyable cast to consume with pomp, irony and satire.Senator Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise) calls upon reporter Janine Roth (Meryl Streep) to receive an exclusive one-hour interview with himself to discuss his new plan to win the war on terror. As he engages in a verbal struggle to make the veteran reporter see his reasoning, his plan of action is already taking effect as a top-secret mission in the Middle East finds two best friends Arian and Ernest (Derek Luke and Michael Pena) abandoned in the cold confines of an icy plateau, waiting for rescue and surrounded by the enemy. Meanwhile, Dr. Stephen Malley (Robert Redford), the professor who negotiated with the two soldiers not to go to war, holds a meeting with another hopeful student who shows promise and potential.Lions for Lambs demonstrates Redford's seasoned talents as a director through the use of three initially separate storylines progressing simultaneously. As the film draws to a close, it becomes more apparent how closely those three groups of people are related, the fact that all three events take place at the same time, and the extreme differences in world affair opinions that each group holds. Despite the occasional flashback, the film is entirely sequential and in chronological order - something few films still do, especially when multiple plot lines are concerned.Lions for Lambs works as both a public service announcement and Redford's own propaganda. While Janine condemns Irving's elusively intelligent words and intimidating propaganda, Redford also spoon feeds the audience with his perceptions of the war on terror. What saves the film from collapsing on its own hypocrisy is the outstanding performances by all of the main characters. In a moment of climactic cinematic irony, Cruise discusses the effectiveness of the trained professional soldiers stationed in the Middle East, as the covert operation over Iran tragically unravels and casualties are quickly incurred.Cruise is inspired as the fast talking, patriotic, red-blooded American Senator who weaves a tale for the press with powerful words and piercing determination. Streep is equally outstanding as the reporter who, despite years of accepting her role as merely a go-between for ruthless politicians to rally their public image, suddenly gains a conscience that forces her to question her position. Redford stars as the professor who is convinced that his talents lie in discovering students with the potential to make a difference, as he did with Arian and Ernest who he was unable to prevent from going off to fight for their beliefs.While heavily opinionated propaganda films rarely equal grand entertainment, Redford is careful to insert a grandiose finale that paints a glowing picture for targets of his mindset on the war. Whether you agree with his outlook and his representation of the ""whatever it takes"" attitude of the government, Lions for Lambs is arguably well-made and brilliantly constructed. And Cruise Photoshoped into photographs with President Bush, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice are hilariously priceless.- Mike Massie",3,Lions for Lambs Movie Review,1194480000,"11 8, 2007",2007,3620,"['Perceptively', 'enlightened', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'political', 'propaganda', 'film', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'loosely', 'smart', 'entertainment', 'Exceptionally', 'strong', 'acting', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'characters', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'unable', 'disguise', 'Redford', 'opinionated', 'brand', 'current', 'events', 'often', 'dangerously', 'close', 'edge', 'being', 'army', 'recruiter', 'occasional', 'overbearingly', 'preachy', 'tone', 'three', 'steadily', 'converging', 'storylines', 'showcase', 'top-notch', 'direction', 'allow', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'fodder', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'cast', 'consume', 'pomp', 'irony', 'satire.Senator', 'Jasper', 'Irving', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'reporter', 'Janine', 'Roth', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'receive', 'exclusive', 'one-hour', 'interview', 'discuss', 'new', 'plan', 'win', 'war', 'terror', 'verbal', 'struggle', 'make', 'veteran', 'reporter', 'see', 'reasoning', 'plan', 'action', 'already', 'taking', 'effect', 'top-secret', 'mission', 'Middle', 'East', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'Arian', 'Ernest', 'Derek', 'Luke', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'abandoned', 'cold', 'confines', 'icy', 'plateau', 'waiting', 'rescue', 'surrounded', 'enemy', 'Meanwhile', 'Dr.', 'Stephen', 'Malley', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'professor', 'who', 'negotiated', 'two', 'soldiers', 'not', 'go', 'war', 'meeting', 'hopeful', 'student', 'who', 'promise', 'potential.Lions', 'Lambs', 'Redford', 'seasoned', 'talents', 'director', 'use', 'three', 'initially', 'separate', 'storylines', 'progressing', 'simultaneously', 'film', 'close', 'more', 'apparent', 'how', 'closely', 'three', 'groups', 'people', 'are', 'related', 'fact', 'three', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'same', 'time', 'extreme', 'differences', 'world', 'affair', 'opinions', 'group', 'occasional', 'flashback', 'film', 'entirely', 'sequential', 'chronological', 'order', 'something', 'few', 'films', 'still', 'do', 'especially', 'when', 'multiple', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'concerned.Lions', 'Lambs', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'Redford', 'own', 'propaganda', 'Janine', 'condemns', 'Irving', 'elusively', 'intelligent', 'words', 'intimidating', 'propaganda', 'Redford', 'also', 'spoon', 'feeds', 'audience', 'perceptions', 'war', 'terror', 'What', 'film', 'collapsing', 'own', 'hypocrisy', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'main', 'characters', 'moment', 'climactic', 'cinematic', 'irony', 'Cruise', 'effectiveness', 'trained', 'professional', 'soldiers', 'stationed', 'Middle', 'East', 'covert', 'operation', 'Iran', 'tragically', 'unravels', 'casualties', 'are', 'quickly', 'incurred.Cruise', 'inspired', 'fast', 'talking', 'patriotic', 'red-blooded', 'American', 'Senator', 'who', 'tale', 'press', 'powerful', 'words', 'piercing', 'determination', 'Streep', 'equally', 'outstanding', 'reporter', 'who', 'years', 'accepting', 'role', 'merely', 'go-between', 'ruthless', 'politicians', 'rally', 'public', 'image', 'suddenly', 'gains', 'conscience', 'question', 'position', 'Redford', 'professor', 'who', 'convinced', 'talents', 'lie', 'discovering', 'students', 'potential', 'make', 'difference', 'did', 'Arian', 'Ernest', 'who', 'was', 'unable', 'prevent', 'going', 'off', 'fight', 'beliefs.While', 'heavily', 'opinionated', 'propaganda', 'films', 'rarely', 'equal', 'grand', 'entertainment', 'Redford', 'careful', 'insert', 'grandiose', 'finale', 'glowing', 'picture', 'targets', 'mindset', 'war', 'agree', 'outlook', 'representation', 'attitude', 'government', 'Lions', 'Lambs', 'arguably', 'well-made', 'brilliantly', 'constructed', 'Cruise', 'Photoshoped', 'photographs', 'President', 'Bush', 'Colin', 'Powell', 'Condoleezza', 'Rice', 'are', 'hilariously', 'priceless.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",Lions for Lambs Theatrical Release
1118593,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000YDJG0I,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 10]","As I watched ""Lions for Lambs"", the new film directed by Robert Redford, starring Redford as a college professor, Meryl Streep as a journalist in Washington and Tom Cruise as a Senator, I felt as though I was sitting in a college lecture class, listening to many of the same topics we discussed when I was in school. And that was almost twenty years ago.The strange thing is, as much as I agree with the politics of this film, I was bored out of my skull.A little more than two thirds of the film involves actors talking with one another, discussing politics, ideology, and the like. But this is a film. It isn't a play. A film should not be lecturing us, it should tell a story about characters that move us to the point of action. There is an attempt to do this, but it doesn't involve any of the three stars, so it seems to be been given short shrift, it almost seems like an after thought added to give the film a little action.Janine Roth (Streep), a journalist well respected in Washington circles, rushes to the office of Senator Jasper Irving (Cruise). Irving has asked Roth to meet so he can tell her about a new offensive they are spearheading in Afghanistan. She is surprised to find he has set aside a full hour for their meeting and proceeds to get the facts about this new operation. During the course of their conversation, she peppers him with questions about the status of the war, the decisions made, what we did wrong, etc. At approximately the same time in California, Professor Malley (Redford) meets with one of his promising students, Todd Hayes (Andrew Garfield). Todd hasn't been attending class and Malley wants to know why;. They begin to talk about taking a stand, making a difference, etc. When Malley realizes he isn't getting through, he tells him about the last two students who `gave me any hope'. Through flashbacks, we see how Ernest Rodrigues (Michael Pena, ""Crash"") and Arian Finch (Derek Luke, ""Catch A Fire"", ""Antwone Fisher"") once excited the professor by challenging him then made the decision to enlist in the Army soon after 9/11. The story then flashes to present day again and we see these same two soldiers leading the new offensive into Afghanistan.I think it is necessary for us to discuss the same things these characters discuss, but because we are basically watching them talk for approximately 75 of the 90 minute running time of the film, there is little or no time for character development, for characters to bring us into the story, to make us care.Streep comes closest with her portrayal of Janine Roth. As she and Senator Irving (Cruise channeling the character he played in ""A Few Good Men"") sit and talk, Roth is barely able to hide her disbelief for the Senator's new plan and his reasons behind it. She doesn't believe him and tries to get to the bottom of the matter. Irving, initially gung ho to talk with her, he set up the meeting after all, becomes more and more reluctant when he realizes she isn't falling into lock step behind him. She returns to her office and talks to her boss, trying to get him to not air the story, to not validate it and give the public a chance to accept it.The Redford lecture is more difficult to handle because it involves flashbacks, which lead to more lectures and discussions. This story only makes its point at the very end, when Todd returns to his dorm and finally realizes how ineffectual his age group is, only because they aren't bothering to take a stand or to make their voice heard.The actual scenes involving the offensive in Afghanistan are interesting, but brief. And even these devolve into the two main characters talking as they await rescue.It is interesting that we have had many films in last three months telling stories about different aspects of our current involvement in the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last month's ""Rendition"", also featuring Meryl Streep, was more effective. It told a fictionalized story, depicting the problem with a policy we have called `rendition'. Because the film had characters, it was easier to become involved in the story. The problem with ""Rendition"" is there are too many characters and we never have a lead character we can empathize with, someone who can lead us to action. ""Lambs"" also fails to incite action because we are basically watching people discuss things we can hear in the news, or read in the paper, or see Jon Stewart make fun of in his Comedy Central program.I have no problem with the viewpoint presented in the film, and welcome having discussions with others, but why should we pay to listen to others talk? Why not release the film and let people in for free? That might kick start some discussions.But, of course, that's a pipedream. If the studio released the film, how would they make any money on the film? I mean, they never make any money on their films anyway, right? The biggest blockbuster can still be considered unprofitable.

1118594,AUB7WXM7IX81,B000YDJG0I,Timothy I. Morgan Jr.,"[1, 4]","This movie flopped at the box office, but it certainly didn't deserve to.  It's an intelligent, incisive, and surprisingly balanced film that addresses ongoing concerns about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without pretension.  It's talkative and politically charged, so it's not a movie for those looking for escapist fare (as the final scene suggests most Americans are).  The most common criticism of Lions for Lambs is that its points have been echoed repeatedly by political pundits, and while that's true to some extent, there are a number of perspectives presented here that, as a whole, form an intriguing and thought-provoking work.Director Robert Redford takes three different points of view on the overarching subject of the War on Terror: one from a hotshot Republican senator (Tom Cruise), another from a weary but still vocal history professor (Redford), and the last from two soldiers stranded on a mountaintop in Afghanistan (Derek Luke and Michael Pe&ntilde;a) waiting for rescue but facing an imminent strike by Taliban inhabitants.  Cruise is providing an interview to a TV reporter (Meryl Streep) and Redford is making a desperate attempt to one of his students to extract him from the political apathy that has started to consume him.The acting is uniformly good, but Cruise and Redford especially stand out.  Cruise is outstanding as the senator who is so charismatic he even convinces himself of his own lies.  Cruise doesn't just play an unctuous pen pusher though; he imbues his character with more complexity than that.  This is a man who genuinely wants to win the wars he helped get his country into and is willing to acknowledge some of his mistakes.  He doesn't want to lose any more lives than he has to, but he is also undaunted in his mission.  Redford presents a notable foil, even if the two never meet: his professor has the experience and the pain to back up his arguments, even if he is getting tired of spouting them.  There's an elegance to his performance but also an urgency to it.The beauty of Redford's approach is that it shows the political rhetoric (as exemplified by Cruise's character), public response (seen most clearly through Redford's character interacting with his dismayed student), and the consequences (portrayed in the Afghanistan scenes) of the wars that the US government has ignited.  Most of the movie shifts between these three scenes, with some flashbacks that illuminate how a few key characters got to the states they ended up in.  It's a smart move, because it juxtaposes several different sides of the arguments for and against the wars and doesn't overwhelm the viewer with one section for too long.The impact of the three sections is fuller and more comprehensive in this way.  At the movie's climax, all of the issues come together, and by the time the movie is over, the impact is that much more powerful.  Between the political and academic debates and the action on the ground that is the result of political decision-making, Redford successfully shows how all of us are affected by these wars in different ways.

1118596,A1RNMPOY4XIAA8,B000YDJG0I,Tristan,"[4, 8]","Robert Redford, Tom Cruise, and Meryl Streep have taken every controversial topic of the current war and condensed them into an engrossing, moving, provocative, hour-and-twenty-minute debate movie.The film takes place over an hour of time, of three separate, yet loosely related, storylines. They are as follows: The first is an ambitious senator (played by Tom Cruise), who has his eye on presidential candidacy, and has called in a famous news reporter (Meryl Streep) to giver her a story for the press about a new strategy he has come up with to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. He hopes that its success will boost this career and he spends his hour of the movie attempting to explain the facts in a very safe, favorable context to the reporter.The second story is two marines who are part of the ""new"" strategy being put into operation as the Senator discusses it. The third story is a Californian college professor (played by Robert Redford) who is meeting with one of his students who has missed one-too-many classes. He is the same professor who taught the two marines.All three storylines are blended together with a seamless, effective simplicity. By having all three happening in the same hour made it effective and almost unsettling as you see the marines fighting in the snowing night, and then come back to the bright, spotless, office of the senator sitting discussing the very strategy being fought. It made me realize how much is constantly happening in simultaneous motion. I cannot even imagine how much has happened as I write this review.As I said, a myriad of controversial topics are brought up but no real answer offered, but that is how it is effective. It brings up the topics and leaves you thinking about it long afterward without the feeling like you were force-fed one opinion. Two strong points that make the film so good are sharp, to-the-point script and the trio of big-name stars who all do wonderful jobs, especially Meryl Streep.

However, it is not real.  Meryl Streep is not Janine Roth and Tom Cruise is not Senator Irving.  Most importantly, this is not a real conversation.  It is a fictitious conversation, where the screenwriter can manipulate the conversation in any way he wants (as it is with all screenplays).  The dialogue in this movie is carefully crafted and controlled for political purposes.  It is propaganda.  Now, both sides of an issue have propaganda.  Propaganda is not bad.  But this movie supposes to speak for both sides of an issue, when in reality it speaks only for one.  The liberal agenda is just as apparent when Irving is speaking as it is when Roth is speaking.

It is a discussion that every father should conduct with his son or everybody should conduct with himself - what to do with our lives? How to make society functional?

1118600,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,B000YDJG0I,Westley,"[6, 9]","""Lions for Lambs"" joins a raft of recent movies exploring the fallout over the war with Iraq.  The subject matter is timely, and this movie has a few interesting things to say about the war and how Americans view politics.  Unfortunately, the movie is so poorly directed and the characters so stock that it ends up failing to make the intended impact.  The all-star cast includes Tom Cruise as a smug young Republican Senator, Meryl Streep as a smug liberal-leaning reporter, Robert Redford as a smug big-thinking Professor, and newcomer British actor Andrew Garfield as a smug, lazy liberal arts student.  Well you get the point.  The characters could hardly be more caricature-like, which greatly waters down the message of the movie.Message movies can be powerful in advancing political and sociological ideas, as witnessed by recent successes such as ""Crash"" and ""Babel.""  Unfortunately, whatever substance ""Lions for Lambs"" has is lost in its overly talky, didactic script.  The movie really consists of three intermixed scenes.  Tom Cruise's character gives an exclusive military scoop to Meryl Streep, who plays the most argumentative reporter in history.  After 5 minutes of arguing with her, a real Senator would show her to the door.  In the second scene, Robert Redford's professor tries to motivate one of his slacker students to really, really care.  These two conversations comprise the bulk of the movie along with what seems at first to be unrelated scenes of a military strike in the Middle East.  Gradually, the dots are connected to explain the relevance of the military section of the plot.  This part of the movie is genuinely affecting at time, helped greatly by solid acting by Michael Pena (Crash, Babel) and Derek Luke (Antwone Fisher).  Indeed, this section of the movie should have been expanded; instead, it became the epitome of liberal guilt, sadly undercutting its ultimate effectiveness.""Lions for Lambs"" is not a terrible movie.  It speeds along quickly and is relatively watchable.  However, what it aims for and what it attains are so disparate as to detract greatly, depending on the individual viewer, from what good things one may take from the movie.  Plus, Redford really doesn't aim high enough for the film to take the title of ""noble failure.""  Excoriating Republicans for being hawkish and taking the press for task for buying into hype aren't exactly going to win you any prizes for originality.",2,Call 911!

Short version:  it doesn't work all that well, because it is dry and wooden.OK, so the medium is lacking.  What about the message?Well, you get to review bad war leadership decisions from the Bush administration.  Who knew?In the Streep/Cruise thread, Cruise very much ends up being the straw man, but gets to put his case across very eloquently.  Merryl Streep often challenges him, but without pressing her arguments (hint: she's doing it for the audience).  When she does really object, it is not with him, but rather with her news manager.  I guess a central point Cruise makes would be hard to answer:  what would exactly happens if the US cuts and runs now?And that's the whole weakness on the foreign policy side:  it criticizes but doesn't manage to even try to articulate an answer.  Or indeed even ask novel and important questions, as it doesn't rise much above canned, though valid, criticism.Where it does come up with its own ideas, through Redford's character, it proposes a woolly, likely useless agenda about an in-USA-Peace-Corps that has absolutely nothing to do with Afghanistan/Iraq.  And it laments the supposed stupidity, ignorance and apathy of the voters.  Original that.  And with just a whiff of elitism.In the end, the best thing about the movie is its title.  It refers to WWI German soldiers admiring the doomed courage of British soldiers at the Battle of the Somme, while they were lead by an incompetent top leadership.  That pretty much summarizes Iraq and Afghanistan 6 years on, though the failures are much less at the military than at the political level.I applaud Robert Redford for trying to wake folks up, but this ain't 'Apocalypse Now', 'Deer Hunter' or even 'Three Kings' in terms of cinema quality or mass appeal.

Nothing, aside from the two friends ""last stand"" at the film's end seemed hacknyed.A lot of people complained that the movie was boring because it lacked action.  I for one, disagree.  I thought that the ideas being flushed out in the film, as well as the tension between the senator (Cruise) and the reporter (Streep), the proffesor and the bright student, and the Rodriguez and Finch's arguments with their classroom really drove this film.  And that's the problem that other's might have with it; the film is character driven, not action.There's a lot of great ideas here.  Are we repeating the same mistakes as we did in Vietnam?  Is the news media more concerned with revenue and entertainment than it is actual news?  Does public relations drive the political process?
