It's awesome ... better than Season 1, and makes me wonder why this show was canceled prematurely ... ?  I still love all the police drama, car chases, and the fantastic San Francisco scenery, which is really like another character in the show.  As someone who is now about the same age as Nash was when the show started, I am even more taken in by all the issues he (and the other characters as well) is dealing with, especially when it comes to family.  Most of us middle-aged baby boomers can relate to what it's like to juggle a job, a home, kids, and aging parents ... and, oh yeah, our own life as well.  Again ... great writing, top-notch acting, relevant storylines, good balance between drama and comedy, and VERY easy on the eyes.  I think I love Nash more than Sonny Crockett because he is just a more realistic character ... and like a fine wine, a few extra years only did him good!",5,Hooked All Over Again,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,944,"['watching', 'Season', '1', 'HAD', 'get', 'Season', '2', 'awesome', 'better', 'Season', '1', 'wonder', 'why', 'show', 'was', 'canceled', 'prematurely', 'still', 'love', 'police', 'drama', 'car', 'chases', 'fantastic', 'San', 'Francisco', 'scenery', 'really', 'like', 'character', 'show', 'someone', 'who', 'now', 'same', 'age', 'Nash', 'was', 'when', 'show', 'started', 'am', 'even', 'more', 'taken', 'issues', 'other', 'characters', 'well', 'dealing', 'especially', 'when', 'family', 'Most', 'middle-aged', 'baby', 'boomers', 'can', 'relate', 'what', 'juggle', 'job', 'home', 'kids', 'aging', 'parents', 'oh', 'yeah', 'own', 'life', 'well', 'Again', 'great', 'writing', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'relevant', 'storylines', 'good', 'balance', 'drama', 'comedy', 'VERY', 'easy', 'eyes', 'think', 'love', 'Nash', 'more', 'Sonny', 'Crockett', 'just', 'more', 'realistic', 'character', 'fine', 'wine', 'few', 'extra', 'years', 'only', 'did', 'good']",Nash Bridges: Season 2

The drama, the comedy and yes, sometimes the sadness makes this one of the best police dramas,including the present days series. The setting which is San Francisco, is the perfect backdrop for the stories.Nash Bridges (Don Johnson) is handsome, very sexy,and sometimes shy. It is easy to understand why the twice divorced Nash is attractive to so many women. Joe Dominguiz (Cheech Marin) is the perfect counterpart to Nash. Joe always has a scheme, which more often then not,colapses, but usually includes Nash. The stories have depth and hold ones interest.

1217670,AMM969VE0Y7NS,B001MVWLYY,Tom S.,"[15, 16]","In my opinion, this is a much better release of Nash Bridges than the first season was. While this season is not as loaded with features as the previous one, this season only has part two of the writers round-table continued from the first season, the presentation of the series itself is better. While the first season contained none of the songs by popular artists featured in the televised versions, this season actually contains some of them, an example being the opening song of the episode 'Night Train'. Also, where the first season DVD's replaced its songs (from James Brown to Rod Stewart and the Allman Brothers) with primarily new created instrumental overdubs, this season actually uses other popular music in place of some of its songs. The picture is once again fantastically restored, as was the first season's and the commentary by Don Johnson and others on a few of the episodes is rather interesting. Overall, in my opinion, this is a better quality release of a great series than was the first season.",4,Better this time around,1236038400,"03 3, 2009",2009,1020,"['opinion', 'much', 'better', 'release', 'Nash', 'Bridges', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'season', 'not', 'loaded', 'features', 'previous', 'one', 'season', 'only', 'part', 'two', 'writers', 'round-table', 'continued', 'first', 'season', 'presentation', 'series', 'better', 'first', 'season', 'contained', 'none', 'songs', 'popular', 'artists', 'featured', 'televised', 'versions', 'season', 'actually', 'example', 'being', 'opening', 'song', 'episode', ""'Night"", 'Train', 'Also', 'where', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'replaced', 'songs', 'James', 'Brown', 'Rod', 'Stewart', 'Allman', 'Brothers', 'primarily', 'new', 'created', 'instrumental', 'overdubs', 'season', 'actually', 'other', 'popular', 'music', 'place', 'songs', 'picture', 'once', 'again', 'fantastically', 'restored', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'commentary', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'others', 'few', 'episodes', 'rather', 'interesting', 'Overall', 'opinion', 'better', 'quality', 'release', 'great', 'series', 'was', 'first', 'season']",Nash Bridges: Season 2
