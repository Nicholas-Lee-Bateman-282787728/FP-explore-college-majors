But this is not one on them.  The series starts shortly after the Lord of Terror incident with Osho (the priest who left on the pilgramige)returning to the temple with all new ideas and beliefs, then 2 minuntes later starting a new one when he runs into one of the famous Urd VS Skuld arguements (the fact that he was still standing after what he got hit with shows he is made of sterner stuff than he lets on).  and the hilarity keeps going from there with Keicheii getting a call from ""HIM"" to Bell getting drunk from a can of cola, with all the warm and tender moments you have come to expect from the series.  Old fans should really enjoy it, but new watchers should DEFINATELY watch the first season before getting into it.

1056663,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000NIBUVC,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","""Ah! My Goddess"" will always have a big place in my heart.Being an old school anime fan, the original OAV's were quite special and the storyline of the manga and the anime series was well-written.The story is about Keiichi, a student at Nekomi Institute of Technology  (or NIT) was in his dorm because his sempai told him to wait for a phone call.While waiting, he got hungry, so Keiichi called  out for some food.He dialed the wrong number and got the ""Goddess Helpers"" office instead.A young cute goddess named Belldandy appeared out of the mirror and said ""Our job is to help people who are in trouble, like you.  I can grant you one wish, no matter what it is..."".Keiichi replied, ""I want you to stay for-ever"".This is the storyline as Keiichi and the goddess Belldandy try to do whatever they can to be together no matter the odds.To help the couple are Belldandy's sisters, the sexy older sister Urd and the younger intellectual sister, Skuld.The series is based on a manga by Fujishima Kosuke and serialized in Monthly ""Afternoon"" from Kodansha, Ltd.Over 23 volumes of the manga series have been published in the U.S. and every animation adaptation has been a big hit.The OAV series came out back in 1993 (from AnimEigo) and made the series a major hit among anime fans in the early 90's.""Ah! My Goddess"" was then shown on television in 1998 (although the characters were super-deforrmed) and in 2005, it became a TV series titled ""Aa Megami-sama: Sorezore no Tsubasa"".The first season was released in the US by Media Blasters and the second season is now being released by ADV Films.In the second season, Keiichi and Belldandy's love for each other is being tested.Most of all, Keiichi is getting closer to showing his true feelings for her and trying to gain the courage to show her how much he cares for her.The first episode features a problem with the Goddess system and the contract binding Keiichi and Belldandy together has been lost.The next episode continues to test the couple as rich girl, Sayoko (who likes Keiichi) will do whatever it takes to get closer to Keiichi, even if it means doing terrible things to Belldandy.Needless to say that it's such a great feeling to have the popular series continued and released in the US on DVD.With the planned TV debut on the Anime Network set for May 3rd, the DVD release is planned for release on May 8th.Volume 1 features commentary by Eileen Stevens (Belldandy) and Drew Aaron (Keiichi), clean opening and closing animations, production artwork and ADV previews.""Ah! My Goddess"" is an anime title that has always been about great storytelling and continues to be a wonderful romantic comedy anime series for fifteen years and still going strong.So, far a very strong start for the second season of the series and looking forward to watching more of anime's awesome couple of the year, Keiichi and Belldandy.",5,The Godesses are back!,1218326400,"08 10, 2008",2008,2872,"['Ah', 'Goddess', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'big', 'place', 'heart.Being', 'old', 'school', 'anime', 'fan', 'original', 'OAV', 'were', 'quite', 'special', 'storyline', 'manga', 'anime', 'series', 'was', 'well-written.The', 'story', 'Keiichi', 'student', 'Nekomi', 'Institute', 'Technology', 'NIT', 'was', 'dorm', 'sempai', 'told', 'wait', 'phone', 'call.While', 'waiting', 'got', 'hungry', 'Keiichi', 'called', 'out', 'food.He', 'dialed', 'wrong', 'number', 'got', 'Goddess', 'Helpers', 'office', 'instead.A', 'young', 'cute', 'goddess', 'named', 'Belldandy', 'appeared', 'mirror', 'said', 'job', 'help', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'trouble', 'can', 'grant', 'one', 'wish', 'matter', 'what', '.Keiichi', 'replied', 'want', 'stay', 'for-ever', '.This', 'storyline', 'Keiichi', 'goddess', 'Belldandy', 'try', 'do', 'can', 'be', 'together', 'matter', 'odds.To', 'help', 'couple', 'are', 'Belldandy', 'sisters', 'sexy', 'older', 'sister', 'Urd', 'younger', 'intellectual', 'sister', 'Skuld.The', 'series', 'based', 'manga', 'Fujishima', 'Kosuke', 'serialized', 'Monthly', 'Afternoon', 'Kodansha', 'Ltd.Over', '23', 'volumes', 'manga', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'published', 'U.S.', 'animation', 'adaptation', 'been', 'big', 'hit.The', 'OAV', 'series', 'came', 'out', 'back', '1993', 'AnimEigo', 'made', 'series', 'major', 'hit', 'anime', 'fans', 'early', ""90's."", 'Ah', 'Goddess', 'was', 'then', 'shown', 'television', '1998', 'characters', 'were', 'super-deforrmed', '2005', 'became', 'TV', 'series', 'titled', 'Aa', 'Megami-sama', 'Sorezore', 'Tsubasa', '.The', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'released', 'US', 'Media', 'Blasters', 'second', 'season', 'now', 'being', 'released', 'ADV', 'Films.In', 'second', 'season', 'Keiichi', 'Belldandy', 'love', 'other', 'being', 'tested.Most', 'Keiichi', 'getting', 'closer', 'showing', 'true', 'feelings', 'trying', 'gain', 'courage', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'her.The', 'first', 'episode', 'problem', 'Goddess', 'system', 'contract', 'binding', 'Keiichi', 'Belldandy', 'together', 'been', 'lost.The', 'next', 'episode', 'test', 'couple', 'rich', 'girl', 'Sayoko', 'who', 'Keiichi', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'get', 'closer', 'Keiichi', 'even', 'doing', 'terrible', 'things', 'Belldandy.Needless', 'say', 'such', 'great', 'feeling', 'have', 'popular', 'series', 'continued', 'released', 'US', 'DVD.With', 'planned', 'TV', 'debut', 'Anime', 'Network', 'set', 'May', '3rd', 'DVD', 'release', 'planned', 'release', 'May', '8th.Volume', '1', 'features', 'commentary', 'Eileen', 'Stevens', 'Belldandy', 'Drew', 'Aaron', 'Keiichi', 'clean', 'opening', 'closing', 'animations', 'production', 'artwork', 'ADV', 'previews.', 'Ah', 'Goddess', 'anime', 'title', 'always', 'been', 'about', 'great', 'storytelling', 'be', 'wonderful', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'anime', 'series', 'fifteen', 'years', 'still', 'going', 'strong.So', 'far', 'very', 'strong', 'start', 'second', 'season', 'series', 'looking', 'forward', 'watching', 'more', 'anime', 'awesome', 'couple', 'year', 'Keiichi', 'Belldandy']","Ah!

1056666,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B000NIBUVC,Sesho,"[1, 2]","The computer that controls Heaven has been reset but some of its data has been corrupted or lost. Included in some of the lost data is the contract between Keiichi and Belldandy. Keiichi soon gets a call from God telling him that he and Belldandy don't have that much time left together. The two lovers accept their fate but Urd and Skuld aren't about to let it happen without a fight. They busily set about retrieving the fragements of the contract still left in the heavenly database. The main antagonist in these first episodes is not a demon or other supernatural being, but Sayoko, the spoiled rich queen of Keiichi's college campus. For the life of her, she can't figure out why Keiichi prefers Belldandy over her. I mean, she's got looks, money, and popularity. Unfortunately for her, she's going to find out that these things alone cannot attract a good man. In fact, she's extremely jealous of Belldandy and probably harbors an attraction for Keiichi that she would never admit to herself. When Belldandy knits a sweater for Keiichi, Sayoko goes nuts trying to outdo her. When Sayoko holds a Christmas party, one of her objectives is to outshine and publicly humiliate Belldandy. Sayoko is beginning to realize what it is she's missing: innate kindness. But due to being around Keiichi and Belldandy, she still has a chance to change.If you can get through one of the most horrible anime theme songs ever recorded in the opening credits of this second season, you'll be gladly surprised that the quality of the show itself hasn't decreased at all. There's just something about Belldandy blowing on bagpipes that grates on the nerves. I really like the fact that Sayoko's character is getting more screen time and is being allowed to evolve. In the first season she was portrayed as a shallow, vacuous shell of a woman, much like Paris Hilton. But in these episodes she attains some depth and gets a bit of enlightenment about facets of her own personality that threaten to ruin her life. The comedy bits were just as funny as usual and Belldandy even lets her hair down when she gets drunk on cola and starts doing rampant acts of goodness! If you liked the first season, definitely continue with the second season.",4,SEPERATION,1182124800,"06 18, 2007",2007,2224,"['computer', 'Heaven', 'been', 'reset', 'data', 'been', 'corrupted', 'lost', 'Included', 'lost', 'data', 'contract', 'Keiichi', 'Belldandy', 'Keiichi', 'soon', 'call', 'God', 'telling', 'Belldandy', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'time', 'left', 'together', 'two', 'lovers', 'accept', 'fate', 'Urd', 'Skuld', 'are', ""n't"", 'let', 'happen', 'fight', 'busily', 'set', 'retrieving', 'fragements', 'contract', 'still', 'left', 'heavenly', 'database', 'main', 'antagonist', 'first', 'episodes', 'not', 'demon', 'other', 'supernatural', 'being', 'Sayoko', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'queen', 'Keiichi', 'college', 'campus', 'life', 'her', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Keiichi', 'Belldandy', 'mean', 'got', 'looks', 'money', 'popularity', 'Unfortunately', 'going', 'find', 'out', 'things', 'alone', 'can', 'not', 'attract', 'good', 'man', 'fact', 'extremely', 'jealous', 'Belldandy', 'probably', 'harbors', 'attraction', 'Keiichi', 'would', 'never', 'admit', 'When', 'Belldandy', 'sweater', 'Keiichi', 'Sayoko', 'nuts', 'trying', 'outdo', 'When', 'Sayoko', 'Christmas', 'party', 'one', 'objectives', 'outshine', 'publicly', 'humiliate', 'Belldandy', 'Sayoko', 'beginning', 'realize', 'what', 'missing', 'innate', 'kindness', 'due', 'being', 'Keiichi', 'Belldandy', 'still', 'chance', 'change.If', 'can', 'get', 'one', 'most', 'horrible', 'anime', 'theme', 'songs', 'ever', 'recorded', 'opening', 'credits', 'second', 'season', ""'ll"", 'be', 'gladly', 'surprised', 'quality', 'show', ""n't"", 'decreased', 'just', 'something', 'Belldandy', 'blowing', 'bagpipes', 'nerves', 'really', 'fact', 'Sayoko', 'character', 'getting', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'being', 'allowed', 'evolve', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'portrayed', 'shallow', 'vacuous', 'shell', 'woman', 'much', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'episodes', 'depth', 'bit', 'enlightenment', 'facets', 'own', 'personality', 'ruin', 'life', 'comedy', 'bits', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'funny', 'usual', 'Belldandy', 'even', 'hair', 'down', 'when', 'drunk', 'cola', 'doing', 'rampant', 'acts', 'goodness', 'liked', 'first', 'season', 'definitely', 'continue', 'second', 'season']","Ah!

1056667,A10U58PHFDK81C,B000NIBUVC,The Anime  Adict,"[5, 5]","Where oh where to begin? This is the first volume of the second season of the animated series based off of one of the most beloved romance/comdey manga of all time. Well first off a few warnings. First off if your new to the franchise, do not buy this one until you've become familized with the franchise or you'll be completely lost. And second to those who like and anime series to follow the manga it's based on word for word, you won't like this. For everybody else, the Goddess are back and better then ever.Now for the actual review. The series picks up right where the last left off, the clean up after the Lord of Terror incident. The flow is nice and shows none of lag found in the mangas and keeps Keiichi and Belldandy's relationship rolling. I for one am very happy to see that the director is moving things along much faster then the manga. Mean their relationship has come along as far in the number of episodes as it had manga. Though this does mean a considerable trimming of the side stories and romances though given the opening not for long. Also they've reworked certain stories that I really don't know who they are going to fix the damage, the hand in hand story arc is completely wrecked unless they pull off some magic. Now on to something beside story line reorganization commentary. The music is just as wonderful as the first time around and the voice acting in both lanuages are spot on and every character sounds exactly as you imagine the would. The art is even better then the last time, the elongated faces are gone allowing for the character designsto really shine, i.e. the goddesses actually look as beautiful as goddesses. Though Keiichi still has elephant ears. Everything in the series is fluid and smooth. The series innocent, charming and warm feeling is back in full force with moments and scenes that you can't help but smile fondly at just remembering them.In the end if you're a fan of the franchise or the previous series be certain to pick this one up. If not go back and pickup the rest of the series and then get back to this one, trust me you want to check out this franchise.",5,It's good to have the goddesses back,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,2125,"['Where', 'oh', 'where', 'begin', 'first', 'volume', 'second', 'season', 'animated', 'series', 'based', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'romance/comdey', 'manga', 'time', 'Well', 'first', 'off', 'few', 'warnings', 'First', 'new', 'franchise', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'one', ""'ve"", 'become', 'familized', 'franchise', ""'ll"", 'be', 'completely', 'lost', 'second', 'who', 'like', 'anime', 'series', 'follow', 'manga', 'based', 'word', 'word', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'everybody', 'else', 'Goddess', 'are', 'back', 'better', 'then', 'ever.Now', 'actual', 'review', 'series', 'up', 'right', 'where', 'last', 'left', 'off', 'clean', 'up', 'Lord', 'Terror', 'incident', 'flow', 'nice', 'none', 'lag', 'found', 'mangas', 'Keiichi', 'Belldandy', 'relationship', 'rolling', 'one', 'am', 'very', 'happy', 'see', 'director', 'moving', 'things', 'along', 'much', 'faster', 'then', 'manga', 'Mean', 'relationship', 'come', 'as', 'far', 'number', 'episodes', 'had', 'manga', 'mean', 'considerable', 'trimming', 'side', 'stories', 'romances', 'given', 'opening', 'not', 'long', 'Also', ""'ve"", 'reworked', 'certain', 'stories', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'fix', 'damage', 'hand', 'hand', 'story', 'arc', 'completely', 'wrecked', 'pull', 'off', 'magic', 'Now', 'something', 'beside', 'story', 'line', 'reorganization', 'commentary', 'music', 'just', 'as', 'wonderful', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'voice', 'acting', 'lanuages', 'are', 'spot', 'character', 'exactly', 'imagine', 'would', 'art', 'even', 'better', 'then', 'last', 'time', 'elongated', 'are', 'gone', 'allowing', 'character', 'designsto', 'really', 'shine', 'i.e', 'goddesses', 'actually', 'look', 'as', 'beautiful', 'goddesses', 'Keiichi', 'still', 'elephant', 'ears', 'Everything', 'series', 'fluid', 'smooth', 'series', 'innocent', 'charming', 'warm', 'feeling', 'back', 'full', 'force', 'moments', 'scenes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'smile', 'fondly', 'just', 'remembering', 'them.In', 'end', ""'re"", 'fan', 'franchise', 'previous', 'series', 'be', 'certain', 'pick', 'one', 'up', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'pickup', 'rest', 'series', 'then', 'get', 'back', 'one', 'trust', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'franchise']","Ah!
