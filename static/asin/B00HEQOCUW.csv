1689312,ANYDQIA5YVBMM,B00HEQOCUW,Alan Ramirez,"[1, 1]","I wasn't very sure of this movie, since Adam Sandler's latest films have been so horrible and over the top. But since it was a Tuesday night and I already saw half of the movies at the theater I decided to give it a chance, at least for Drew Barrymore. And I was surprised! Blended might become one of the best comedies of the summer. The movie is so well acted, funny, and the whole cast was great. Adam and Drew share a great chemistry, and he's funny and she's charming as usual.The humor is great (it doesn't fall to stupid humor like most Adam Sandler's films), and the jokes are well executed, they don't feel forced... you are laughing during the whole movie.The balance of comedy and seriousness (when it had to be serious), makes ""Blended"" a great example of what a comedy film should be, as an audience to feel good while you enjoy the story and the acting, but also caring for the characters. There's not a boring moment in this film. It's sad it wasn't really successful, it deserved a better chance. This movie is a must watch of the summer movies of this year!",5,A great surprise,1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,1074,"['was', ""n't"", 'very', 'sure', 'movie', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'latest', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'horrible', 'top', 'was', 'Tuesday', 'night', 'already', 'saw', 'half', 'movies', 'theater', 'decided', 'give', 'chance', 'least', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'was', 'surprised', 'Blended', 'might', 'become', 'one', 'best', 'comedies', 'summer', 'movie', 'so', 'well', 'acted', 'funny', 'whole', 'cast', 'was', 'great', 'Adam', 'Drew', 'share', 'great', 'chemistry', 'funny', 'charming', 'usual.The', 'humor', 'great', ""n't"", 'fall', 'stupid', 'humor', 'most', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'films', 'jokes', 'are', 'well', 'executed', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'forced', 'are', 'laughing', 'whole', 'movie.The', 'balance', 'comedy', 'seriousness', 'when', 'had', 'be', 'serious', 'Blended', 'great', 'example', 'what', 'comedy', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'audience', 'feel', 'good', 'enjoy', 'story', 'acting', 'also', 'caring', 'characters', 'not', 'boring', 'moment', 'film', 'sad', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'successful', 'deserved', 'better', 'chance', 'movie', 'must', 'watch', 'summer', 'movies', 'year']",N/A
1689313,A2EO4O7D7BA2K8,B00HEQOCUW,Blood,"[1, 5]","Adam Sandler used to be a good comedian, though some have trouble remembering when. Even I have difficulty believing that only twenty years ago he was at the helm of great comedies like ""Billy Madison"" and ""The Waterboy"", entirely due to his recent track record as an actor. In the past few years alone, he's produced and starred in a number of box-office flops like 2011's ""Jack and Jill"" and the subsequent ""That's My Boy"". Not only has he failed to make us laugh as his career has gone on but he's also failed to make money, and that's probably why he continues to turn to these formulaic and childish pieces of work, his newest being `Blended'.Centered around two single parents who meet on an unfortunate blind date, one of which divorced and another grieving over their spouse's death, we see them quite conveniently find their way on a trip to Africa together forced to pose as husband and wife. Sounds stupid, right? Guess what, it is.Feeling as if its story was plucked from the 80's with today's pop-culture thrown in to make it seem somewhat relevant, it treats the audience as if their stupid, throwing every mindless joke that it can on screen (one of which involving elephants making love). Ridiculous from beginning to end and certainly not in a funny way, it succeeded in making me groan and roll my eyes for two hours straight.

1689316,A2RX6ATG37L17S,B00HEQOCUW,Larry Leach,"[3, 4]","Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler both have been fading fast over the past years, making pointless movies. Now they are back together again for the 3rd time, perhaps an attempt to bring back some of the old magic. For those unaware, they were also together in The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates, both of which were excellent movies. this 3rd one doesn't disappoint either.Some of the old Sandler crew can be seen as well as a lot of new people in front of and behind the camera. This has brought a badly needed fresh new look to the typical Sandler movie. The characters are acting their age and the old typical acting styles have been toned down. this is a regular down-to-earth couple that deals with an unusual situation. No silliness from them this time. That's not to say that the comedic bits aren't there. There's plenty going on around these 2 to keep you entertained. I must say that some of it is very funny, but some of it is over the top and trying too hard. In this way, it's uneven.  Multiple viewings could get annoying.I enjoyed seeing these 2 together and acting like normal people. This is no fairy tale and this is no romp through Africa. There are plenty of serious and touching parts to this movie as well. A generous amount actually for a comedy movie.I really enjoyed this movie. It is a feel-good movie and well worth a see in spite of it's flaws.

1689317,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B00HEQOCUW,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[9, 10]","Adam Sandler (Grown Ups, Billy Madison) is back on the big screen and in an honest attempt to make a real funny family film; he succeeded with &#8220;Blended&#8221;. Directed by Frank Coraci (Click, Zookeeper) and written by Ivan Menchell (Bedtime, The Nanny) and Clare Sera (Doin&#8217; It Yourself) the film pairs up Adam and Drew Barrymore (E.T., Charlie&#8217;s Angles) for the fourth time and this time they have a wonderful on screen chemistry and they play very well of each other&#8217;s sarcasm.Drew and Adam play divorced parents of kids that are estranged to them both as separated parents. All the kids, in both their respective families, have issues and none of them seem a cohesive unit in the beginning. The first half of the movie they hate each other, starting with their first date, then by the second act, in a realistic and very funny way, they end up &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; falling for each other.Adam has three girls. Two, in the beginning look very much like boys. They are played by Emma Fuhrmann (Are We Listening) and Bella Thorne (Frenemies, Shake It Up!) and their transformations is extremely heartwarming thanks to Drew&#8217;s motherly touch. Now for the &#8216;AWE&#8217; factor of the film, throw in his third and youngest daughter played by Alyvia Alyn Lind (Dark Skies, Fire Twister) and you have a truly realistic divorced dad with a really big heart.Now Drew&#8217;s has two boys who are typically loud, obnoxious at times and a little sneaky whenever they can be played by Braxton Beckham (ICarly, NCSI) and Kyle Red Silverstein (Grey&#8217;s Anatomy, Lift) who test the patience of everyone in the movie. Now thanks to Adam, the boys learn some valuable lessons on relationships, sports and a whole lot more. See where this is going?Now, through a series of circumstances and a little misrepresentation, both Drew and Adam basically lie about a trip that Adam&#8217;s boss (who we never see) was going to take with Drew&#8217;s best friend, Jen. And a very special note to actress  Wendi McLendon-Covey ( Reno 911, Bridesmaids) who plays Drew&#8217;s best friend Jen because she always steels the moments with her quick wit, her wry humor and her ever piercing sarcasm. I was in tears with many of her quick whips of verbal abuse she tends to give everyone &#8211; no holds barred!Where is this Trip? A South African resort that is especially for &#8216;Blended&#8217; and mixed families - both straight and gay - and they&#8217;re there to be bonding while supposedly having a good time. You can imagine all the African comical situations you can think of (including animals) and some that will absolutely shock you in a very funny (but in a family style) way. Needless to say both Adam and Drew have no idea their disdain for each other would continue in Africa and in the same suite! The rest is a pure comedy delight!Equally as funny but in the more negative letch-like way, is Joel McHale (Ted, Community) who plays Drew&#8217;s ex-husband as rotten as scummy as could be. He does a nice job at the  antagonistic role that really &#8216;eggs&#8217; everyone in the film on.Kevin Nealon (SNL, Anger Management) and Jessica Lowe (Living The Dream, Wish It Inc.) play a divorced &#8216;blended&#8217; couple who can keep their hands (arms, legs, feet, lips) off of each other through most of the film and they do it with some hysterical results. They too have a son with communication issues played by Zack Henri (Teacher of the Year) who later comes out of his shell thanks to Adams &#8216;transformed&#8217; daughter. (You&#8217;ll just have to see how that is done in a very charming way!)Wonderful character actor Terry Crews (Bridesmaids, Get Smart) plays this wildly funny musical host at the African hotel who seems to literally pop up everywhere you would not expect him too. He too steels some of the scenes with his huge eyes and bright big smile while he sings various altered editions of popular songs.This is definitely a family film with a lot of crazy and wild humor but at its center it has a real true heart to it. I had so much fun watching all the characters come to life in a hysterical way that &#8220;Blended&#8221; will literally make you laugh from start to finish with all its characters and exotic situations. Some for the whole family to see and be sure to tell them Lorenzo of the [...] sent you!",4,&#8220;So Funny &#8211; &#8220;Blended&#8221; Is The Perfect Comedy With A Heart&#8221;,1401580800,"06 1, 2014",2014,4373,"['Adam', 'Sandler', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'back', 'big', 'screen', 'honest', 'attempt', 'make', 'real', 'funny', 'family', 'film', 'succeeded', '8220', 'Blended', '8221', 'Directed', 'Frank', 'Coraci', 'Click', 'Zookeeper', 'written', 'Ivan', 'Menchell', 'Bedtime', 'Nanny', 'Clare', 'Sera', 'Doin', '8217', 'film', 'up', 'Adam', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'E.T.', 'Charlie', '8217', 'Angles', 'fourth', 'time', 'time', 'have', 'wonderful', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'play', 'very', 'well', 'other', '8217', 'sarcasm.Drew', 'Adam', 'play', 'divorced', 'parents', 'kids', 'are', 'estranged', 'separated', 'parents', 'kids', 'respective', 'families', 'have', 'issues', 'none', 'seem', 'cohesive', 'unit', 'beginning', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'hate', 'other', 'starting', 'first', 'date', 'then', 'second', 'act', 'realistic', 'very', 'funny', 'way', 'end', 'up', '8211', 'guessed', '8211', 'falling', 'other.Adam', 'three', 'girls', 'Two', 'beginning', 'look', 'very', 'much', 'boys', 'are', 'played', 'Emma', 'Fuhrmann', 'Are', 'Listening', 'Bella', 'Thorne', 'Frenemies', 'Shake', 'Up', 'transformations', 'extremely', 'heartwarming', 'thanks', 'Drew', '8217', 'motherly', 'touch', 'Now', '8216', 'AWE', '8217', 'factor', 'film', 'throw', 'third', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'played', 'Alyvia', 'Alyn', 'Lind', 'Dark', 'Skies', 'Fire', 'Twister', 'have', 'truly', 'realistic', 'divorced', 'dad', 'really', 'big', 'heart.Now', 'Drew', '8217', 'two', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'typically', 'loud', 'obnoxious', 'times', 'little', 'sneaky', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'Braxton', 'Beckham', 'ICarly', 'NCSI', 'Kyle', 'Red', 'Silverstein', 'Grey', '8217', 's', 'Anatomy', 'Lift', 'who', 'test', 'patience', 'everyone', 'movie', 'Now', 'Adam', 'boys', 'learn', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'relationships', 'sports', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'See', 'where', 'going', 'Now', 'series', 'circumstances', 'little', 'misrepresentation', 'Drew', 'Adam', 'basically', 'trip', 'Adam', '8217', 's', 'who', 'never', 'see', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'Drew', '8217', 'best', 'friend', 'Jen', 'very', 'special', 'note', 'actress', 'Wendi', 'McLendon-Covey', 'Reno', '911', 'Bridesmaids', 'who', 'Drew', '8217', 'best', 'friend', 'Jen', 'always', 'steels', 'moments', 'quick', 'wit', 'wry', 'humor', 'ever', 'piercing', 'sarcasm', 'was', 'tears', 'many', 'quick', 'whips', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'give', 'everyone', '8211', 'barred', 'Where', 'Trip', 'A', 'South', 'African', 'resort', 'especially', '8216', 'Blended', '8217', 'mixed', 'families', 'straight', 'gay', '8217', 're', 'be', 'bonding', 'supposedly', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'can', 'imagine', 'African', 'comical', 'situations', 'can', 'think', 'including', 'animals', 'will', 'absolutely', 'shock', 'very', 'funny', 'family', 'style', 'way', 'Needless', 'say', 'Adam', 'Drew', 'have', 'idea', 'disdain', 'other', 'would', 'continue', 'Africa', 'same', 'suite', 'rest', 'pure', 'comedy', 'delight', 'Equally', 'funny', 'more', 'negative', 'letch-like', 'way', 'Joel', 'McHale', 'Ted', 'Community', 'who', 'Drew', '8217', 's', 'ex-husband', 'as', 'rotten', 'scummy', 'could', 'be', 'nice', 'job', 'antagonistic', 'role', 'really', '8216', '8217', 'everyone', 'film', 'on.Kevin', 'Nealon', 'SNL', 'Anger', 'Management', 'Jessica', 'Lowe', 'Living', 'Dream', 'Wish', 'Inc.', 'play', 'divorced', '8216', 'blended', '8217', 'couple', 'who', 'can', 'keep', 'hands', 'arms', 'legs', 'feet', 'lips', 'other', 'most', 'film', 'do', 'hysterical', 'results', 'too', 'have', 'son', 'communication', 'issues', 'played', 'Zack', 'Henri', 'Teacher', 'Year', 'who', 'later', 'shell', 'thanks', 'Adams', '8216', 'transformed', '8217', 'daughter', '8217', 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'done', 'very', 'charming', 'way', 'Wonderful', 'character', 'actor', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'Bridesmaids', 'Get', 'Smart', 'wildly', 'funny', 'musical', 'host', 'African', 'hotel', 'who', 'literally', 'pop', 'up', 'everywhere', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'too', 'too', 'scenes', 'huge', 'eyes', 'bright', 'big', 'smile', 'various', 'altered', 'editions', 'popular', 'songs.This', 'definitely', 'family', 'film', 'lot', 'crazy', 'wild', 'humor', 'center', 'real', 'true', 'heart', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watching', 'characters', 'come', 'life', 'hysterical', 'way', '8220', 'Blended', '8221', 'will', 'literally', 'make', 'start', 'finish', 'characters', 'exotic', 'situations', 'whole', 'family', 'see', 'be', 'sure', 'tell', 'Lorenzo', '[', 'sent']",N/A

I believe this is the 3rd time Sanders and Barrymore have made a movie together and this time they have families with them.Sanders loves to make jokes and this movie full of them. Of course, not all the jokes are funny and very obvious there will be one coming up. Then, many times they may take a joke too far, where it started out funny, but they ended up continuing the joke and it's not as funny as before. An example of this would be Terry Crews singing and dancing scenes out of nowhere appearances. They use Terry throughout the movie to make these funny awaked moment jokes. Yes, the first few times were kind of funny, but after seeing the 3rd to 4th time - I was done! It just got kind of ignoring after that, and trust me, there are way more than 4 times you see this joke! Like double that amount.
