And I was wondering if after all this time we could please let us drop ""alternative"" when talking about the music? It's just great rock 'n' roll. I don't even know what alternative means. Maybe alternative to sucking. It doesn't even make remote sense now. Alternative to metal hair bands of the 80s? So many newer bands owe a debt to the Pixies. They were a great band and proved they can still rock after many years apart. Their reunion tour is captured well here. You see sorta warts and all I guess. But they leave some mystery as to what makes the Pixies one of rock's most important bands of the last 30 years. Well I'd put 'em up there as truly one the all time best bands.

1006980,A13SPPHQ4LWP4F,B000GTLB12,Andrij W. Zip,"[1, 1]","Excellent documentary on the Pixies.  Keep in mind it's just that - a documentary.  There is some good concert footage, but the point of this film is to show the strained yet professional relationship between all four members of the Pixies during their 2004 reunion tour.  It's fascinating to watch them interact off-stage - all four of them seem to be in their own orbits.  They don't really talk with each other and when they do, it seems like they are keeping their distance.  As well, when they do interact it's mostly for professional reasons.  However, once on stage the four of them use their music to find some common ground (most of the time) and really make magic.  The great thing is that after nearly fifteen years the music hasn't aged and they haven't lost their edge - if anything maturity has added a dimension of artistic credibility to their music.

The concert shots are short and more ""inserts"" than full-blown songs.I figured that I'd get a look at what the Pixies were really like personally watching this movie but I was blown away by how much you learn about them: about Frank's new family, Joey's current family, Kim's realtionship with her sister and the fans that worship her and David's near brush with substance absuse which captures one of the most bizarre moments in the whole film--their Chicago appearance where he's lost.Other fascinating things about this film are the way fans (old AND new, which is amazing) worship them, about how they can all sit in a room and not speak, the Chicago fan who starts her own Pixies cover band.  The first warmup gig is a gas to watch too.If you're a Pixies fan this is a MUST HAVE and essential viewing.  Absolutely no two ways about it.  Even if you're a casual fan (I am), I was riveted to the film the whole time--it stands on its own whether you like their music or not.  It's vaguely reminiscent of the Radiohead film following them around on tour.The other fascinating aspect to it is to see what had become of the lives of former indie-rock superstars in the years since.  While that is kind of depressing, the most uplifting thing about the film is how many TEENAGE fans the Pixies have currently, which is nothing short of astounding.  Their music has jumped a generation, which is rare.Best band documentary I've seen since the Radiohead one, and overall.  This is how to do them.  Five stars.",5,Wow.

I was hoping to hear good music and see inside the lives of the band members and I feel that is exactly what I got from Loud Quiet Loud. As a matter of fact it was almost uncomfortable how we saw into their private feelings,worries and doubts. This film really lets you see them as people not just vastly talented musicians who must live a fairy tale life like people imagine celebrities. In this picture you see Dave Lovering go through the loss of his father,and his unraveling. Joey Santiago as he has to be away from his wife while she is expecting and struggle to score a film while on tour. You feel the concern for whether Kim Deal will be able to maintain her sobriety in the rock and roll atmosphere and show pressure. Last but not least you see Charles Thompson(black francis)and his frustration wanting to do more.

1006986,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000GTLB12,Robert Moore,"[45, 47]","I have pretty much all of the currently available DVDs on the Pixies and while all of them have their merits, this one far outstrips the others in giving an inside glimpse into the band and its members.  I found it far more interesting than THE PIXIES SELL OUT, which concentrates almost exclusively on their stage performances on the tour that, or any of the other Pixies concert DVDs.  What sets this one apart is the incredibly immediate and personal approach of the filmmaker.  The live performances are not neglected, but the focus is far more on the individual members of the band and the particular struggles they undergo during the making of the documentary.The Pixies are, in my opinion, the last truly influential American rock band.  True, Nirvana was more commercially successful, but as even Kurt Cobain admitted, Nirvana was heavily influenced by the Pixies.  In fact, most of the big bands of the nineties were heavily indebted to the Pixies.  But the Pixies never reaped the financial benefits that the major alternative bands of the nineties enjoyed.  Though none of them received the kind of international critical acclaim that the Pixies basked in, many of them sold far more records.  They broke up in the early nineties due to intense acrimony between singer/songwriter Black Francis (aka Charles Thompson aka Frank Black) and bassist/vocalist Kim Deal.  They reunited in 2004 for a concert tour for a variety of reasons, some having to do with a desire to reconnect with their fans and more having to do with economic need.  The title refers to the way that they would shift from very, very quiet music to intensely loud and raucous, with Thompson moving from a near whisper to one of the great screams in the history of rock.The portraits of the various band members that emerge are almost without precedent in rock documentaries.  Several members of the band are a little worse for wear.  In particular Kim Deal appears to have gone through some rough times.  In watching some other DVDs featuring performances from their reunion, I was disappointed to see Kim Deal drinking a number of beers throughout.  She has struggled with alcoholism and drugs and seeing her sipping from the bottle through the concerts seemed like an open embrace of her addictions.  I was delighted to learn from the film that in fact the tour was an alcohol free tour, with the other three members of the band agreeing to not having any alcohol backstage.  The beers that I saw Deal drinking in the other DVDs were non-alcoholic beers like O'Doul's.  In fact, as the film reveals, Deal has waged a more or less successful battle against her addictions.  She comes across in the film as a survivor, but a somewhat fragile one.  She enlists the help of her identical twin sister Kelly, herself the veteran of struggles against addiction, for emotional support.We get similar portraits of the other band members.  David Lovering is shown having struggled with a variety of problems, including borderline poverty and homelessness.  But he is also shown endearingly as someone who embraced other interests after his time with the Pixies, including magic (he is now a practicing magician) and, very curiously, searching for metal on beaches using a metal detector.  The tour is a godsend for him, helping pull himself out of his financial difficulties.  Unfortunately, he also struggles with drug use as he self-medicates to deal with the grief following his father's death.  One of the odder moments in the film comes when Lovering continues to pound away on the drums even though the song has come to an end, Thompson and Deal having a bit of a conference to decide what to do (they tell the audience that they are going to take a brief break to regroup).  Joey Santiago is the Quiet Pixie.  Even at the end of the film you don't have much of a sense for what he is like or what drives him.  He is shown as a loving father to his wife and two kids and we see him working on his Notebook on some film scores, but we simply don't get close to him.The huge presence in the band, figuratively as well as literally, is Charles Thompson.  Although the Pixies are a great band, with all members contributing to the sound, Thompson is clearly the band's resident genius.  But even though he is the leader of one of the great bands ever, he seems to struggle with his own disappointments.  He clearly feels the pressure to write songs for a new Pixies album and is disappointed that he has not had more success in his solo career (in part of the film he discusses with his producer what label might be willing to release his latest album).  And there are things not discussed.  There is not a single word about his absolutely astonishing weight gain.  Charles Thompson just might be the most obese rocker ever.  He has probably gained a hundred pounds since the break up of the Pixies in the nineties.  Yet there is no mention of this in the film.Despite all the problems each individual faces, the music is still astonishingly great.  They truly do sound as good as ever in this tour.  The film also shows how validated they felt by the reception they received upon coming out of retirement.  Their entire tour sold out in only a few minutes upon the tickets going on sale.  I tried to get tickets but failed (I could probably have gone stood outside and cadged a ticket, but I wasn't in the mood the night of the concert here in Chicago).  One of the most touching moments in the film did occur in Chicago when a young who couldn't have been out of her mid-teens (I don't remember it being an all ages concert, but it had to have been) talks about reading an adolescent book in which the protagonist continually talks about the Pixies.  The book inspired her to looks into their music and subsequently to strive to form a Pixies cover band.  She is front and center during their performance at the Aragon.  I loved it when at the end of the concert Kim Deal leaned over to one of the guards and asked him to give her pick to the girl.  As the opening credits come up we get to hear her band play for several measures and while they lack somewhat vocally, they managed to play quite credibly.Anyone who has ever enjoyed the Pixies absolutely has to see this DVD.  Although there are several DVDs that have been released in the past couple of years, this is far and away the best.  Rarely has any film given us such a personal glimpse into the lives of musicians.",5,By far the best DVD on the Pixies and one of the best rock DVDs of the year,1164326400,"11 24,

First encountered the band in 1988 and became a huge fan forever.  Kim is still a junkie, anyone who has seen her on tour with Breeders can see that.  Pose for the camera.  At least Lovering is true to himself.  Charles/Frank/Black is himself as always.  I think Kelly, a non player in the Pixies history, is more excited than anyone else to be there.  Cha-Ching!!  Joey is surf-rock madness and just takes a back seat but is the star.
