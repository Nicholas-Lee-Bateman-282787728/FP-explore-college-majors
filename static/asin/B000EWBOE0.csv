Gorman  &#34;Crystalline Structure Moon&#34;,"[0, 0]","i don't remember how i turned on to this Canadian comedy classic on PBS, but i loved it right from the start! i never thought i could say that about a show that has absolutely no women in it...but this show is hilarious! it's just small town blue-collar men having fun laughing about what makes them men. creator steve smith is supurb in the title role. and patrick mckenna is incredible as red's geeky-geek-geek nephew, harold. every time you see harold, you just want to punch him in the face because he is such a geek. still, he helps make the show as outrageously funny as it is. this is the first season i bought, and i made sure i picked a season with harold in it...because i've seen shows from the era where he was missing....and even though the entire cast is great, the show loses a lot of its appeal in the seasons when he is absent.this show explores a number of the great things about being men: there is folksy advice on life, relationships, how to stand up to bullies.....they always have their own group projects like having a running of the bulls (even though they only have 2 bulls), starting their own downtown mall by taking advantage of that fact that all the stores are connected by sewers, harold starts his own neighborhood watch program, etc......and of course, red has his handyman corner where he shows you how to build and fix things using everyday items you can find around the house or out in the yard or stuff you can steal from neighbors, junkyards or construction sites, and of course lots and lots of the handyman's secret weapon: duct tape! it's funny AND informative! you can learn to make a barbeque with 3 bathtubs, including pipes showerheads and duct tape.....or your own Airstream trailer using two aluminum boats (1 with trailer), a bunch of discarded appliances and duct tape....your own private reclining mancave using an old freezer, a tv, a water cooler jug and duct tape....and many more (with duct tape)! once in a while, it even works (or at least doesn't explode or burn up)! it's folksy, good-natured, small town blue-collar fun....well-conceived, written and acted by a wonderful cast. it's the greatest entertainment to come out of Canada since The Guess Who! so give it a chance, sit back, get out your duct tape and have a good laugh! you'll be glad you did....even if it IS Canadian!

979676,A3B79JJXKMM9ZH,B000EWBOE0,"R. L. Towler ""Blatzman""","[27, 27]","First off, I would like to mention that I was recently in Canada; Vancouver, British Columbia to be exact, visiting relatives for about 3 weeks. This set was released early in May. I could not find one store that usually stocks DVD's in the Vancouver area that carried this title. Being a Canadian show; I thought this rather odd. That changed when I started asking about it. One store would have ordered it for me for $49.99 Canadian, which I thought was a little pricey for 17 episodes. But, I do like this show, so I waited till I got home to the US and bought it here. It was well worth the wait.I first found out about Red Green as most Americans did; from watching the program on PBS. I found out later that some of us closer to the border like Detroit, Buffalo and Seattle could pick it up on the CBC network directly. I was hooked from the start, for those of you who have never seen the show, it's like ""Home Improvement"" meets ""Green Acres"". But Steve Smith (Red Green) isn't as obnoxious as Tim Allen. Red Green is the leader of the Possum Lodge on Possum Lake; which is approximately 120 or so, beer stores north of Toronto, Ontario. Red Green thinks of himself as quite the handyman. He always finds a way to fix, repair or mend things with duct tape or as he refers to it as; ""The handyman's secret weapon."" Red has probably done more advertising for the 3M company than anyone else in the free world. In this set he makes a double wide limo out of two exact model and color, compact cars, that just happen to have been side-swiped on opposite sides. They are held together by; you guessed it, duct tape. When his van breaks down he uses a boat trailer and a 4 door Ford LTD to make a tow car (truck). It's amazing what he can do with a little ingenuity and lots of duct tape. These little jewels are included in the ""Handyman Corner"" segment of each episode. The funny thing about these hare-brained ideas of his is that they all seem to work! Well, probably for a little while anyway.Some of you may wonder why they decided to start on season 7. I think I know the answer and Steve Smith confirms this in the program notes included with this set. When the show first started, it was just Red and his nephew Harold (Patrick McKenna) that were on the show. They were doing the show from smaller studios at independent networks with enough room for a couple of sets on the sound stage. Gradually, they started adding on characters. But 1997 was a indeed a lucky year for the show. The CBC network picked them up, gave the series a bigger budget and a larger studio set. The first studios only held about 100 people. The newer studio sat 300. They were able to do two shows of the same material in one night in front of two different audiences. As Steve Smith recalls; ""The show probably would not have lasted for 15 years if the CBC hadn't picked us up."" They were also able to do a lot more of the skits outside the studio, this was especially nice for some of the Handyman Corner segments. This is the same year that they re-named the series ""The New"" Red Green Show.  So as I stated before; there are 17 episodes in this set on 3 single sided DVD disks. I own all 6 of the ""Red Green Stuffed & Mounted"" series and there are two episodes from the Stuffed & Mounted series that are in season 7. They are as follows.""The Good Old Hockey Game"" (Stuffed & Mounted #5)""The Splinter Lodge""  (Stuffed & Mounted #6)There are program notes on disk one as well as biographies for just Red and Harold. These are the same biographies that are in the Stuffed & Mounted Disks. There is an individual episode play as well as ""play all"" option on the menu. It's easy to navigate through.My only complaint is that the colors are a little dark and when there is a dark background, it darkens the colors even more. But the picture is crisp with no drop outs, so that makes it a little easier on the eyes.The characters we all know and love are also included, Mike Hamar, Dalton Humphrey, Edgar Montrose, Ranger Gord and many others. And of course, my personal favorite, Hap Shaughnessy; the captain of the only ferry that crosses Possum Lake. Hap has done everything from playing for the 1967 Stanley Cup Champion, Toronto Maple Leafs to replacing Keith Richards on a Rolling Stones Tour. He also invented Christmas lights during World War II. When he was under the command of Sergeant Pepper. They were out of ammo and he invented the flashing lights so the German's would think they were still firing their weapons. Field Marshall Montgomery awarded him the Medal of Honor for this. Hap always has a tall tale to tell.One of my favorite lines is. ""It's time once again to talk about those three little words that men find so hard to say""....and the audience responds in unison with a loud ""I Don't Know!""I highly recommend this set to Red Green fans. So; if you are looking for something entertaining and laugh out loud funny, all I can tell you is, you can't go wrong with Red Green. So go ahead and get it, you won't be sorry.",5,"""If it ain't broke, you're not trying.""",1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,5026,"['First', 'would', 'like', 'mention', 'was', 'recently', 'Canada',

979678,A2Q65OXHQY32Q9,B000EWBOE0,Wodehouse Freak,"[3, 3]","This long-running Canadian comedy was popularised by PBS, but for those of us whose PBS stations do not broadcast this highly entertaining mock handyman sitcom, the DVDs are all we have. Steve Smith is Red Green, the host and expert on backwoods do-it-yourself projects, along with Patrick McKenna, who plays Harold Green, Red's geeky nephew and foil. Besides your guides, there are a number of colourful characters from Possom Lodge who are every bit quirky as the lead characters, including some very eccentric guests such as Graham Greene and Dave Thomas.1997 marks the seventh season of its fifteen-year run, so I wonder why Acorn Media started here instead of at the beginning? Then I comfort myself with the realisation that I can't view these episodes any other way... It's a start (excluding the ""Stuffed And Mounted"" volumes and specials).Learn how to turn two cars into a Hummer! What's better: curling or hockey? What do you do when you inherit 137 tubas?Besides strange, fantastic (as in fantasy) ways to recycle old vehicles and appliances, the scripts are well-written, very witty at times, whilst heavy with puns at others. Usually I do not like puns, but if they are set up well enough, I do appreciate the effort.There are 17 episodes, Red and Harold biographies, and production notes by Steve Smith.
