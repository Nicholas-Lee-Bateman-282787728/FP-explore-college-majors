Wilson,"[0, 2]","I was very impressed with the background and the subtle humor from the background that went along with the banter of the fights and obvious humor (small spoiler - ex: Doc Ock defeated on the octopus ride, very well played). All the stories were well written for adults! 6 stars! The only main problem I have is the childish large eyes that distract and belittle the character of the show itself. 2 stars! Also Spider-man is drawn a bit out of proportion many times. Why? 3 stars! This goes for all 8 Volumes. Then we have 3 or 4 episodes per Vol. and Paying $95 for 26 episodes is uncalled for. No stars, just a blackhole.",5,Great - except the eyes,1332979200,"03 29, 2012",2012,622,"['was', 'very', 'impressed', 'background', 'subtle', 'humor', 'background', 'went', 'banter', 'fights', 'obvious', 'humor', 'small', 'spoiler', 'ex', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'defeated', 'octopus', 'ride', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'stories', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'adults', '6', 'stars', 'only', 'main', 'problem', 'have', 'childish', 'large', 'eyes', 'distract', 'belittle', 'character', 'show', '2', 'stars', 'Also', 'Spider-man', 'drawn', 'bit', 'proportion', 'many', 'times', 'Why', '3', 'stars', '8', 'Volumes', 'Then', 'have', '3', '4', 'episodes', 'Vol', 'Paying', '95', '26', 'episodes', 'uncalled', 'stars', 'just', 'blackhole']",The Spectacular Spider-Man: Volume One
