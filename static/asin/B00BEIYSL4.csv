I suspect it will be more loved by folks over 40 (or 50!) than those under.The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was that the the parts for Thompson, Hanks and Farell seemed a little over-written to make it REALLY clear where they were each coming from. I think it could have been dialed back a bit, but hey, it was a produced by Disney.The story line was good and the supporting cast was excellent.That being said, I watched the show with my 21 year old daughter who thought it was &#34;pretty good&#34;. I on the other hand, I saw Mary Poppins as a 5 year old when it came out in theaters (and about 20 times since). She could not recall ever seeing it (we are gonna be fixing that, btw). I think this film impacted me because I knew the plot and characters of the 1964 flick. It seriously brought back a lot of memories which made me like both films that much more.

Travers was an artist with a Jungian orientation and a lot of ideas about mythology etc., but the movie presents her as a tiresome egotistical neurotic who secretly wallows in sentimentality.  It also soft pedals Disney's disingenuous insistence on using animation in the film.  In fact, the animation in Mary Poppins is lousy, and I've read that Travers confronted Disney angrily about it after the premier and was more less told, ""tough, little lady."" The Los Angeles and London segments are fun, but the Australian part mostly is an over-sentimentalized bore, except for the arrival of the ""original ""Mary Poppins"" toward the end.  Would have liked more of that.  And, speaking of veracity, couldn't Disney Inc. afford to do Australian locations in Australia instead of California?

Sure, it is a flawed film, in more ways than one, and the overt sentimentality of it all is sure to rub people the wrong way, and is one of those things that I have been known to criticize in other films, and yet there was something so pure and utterly enjoyable about every frame here that I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a deep swell of affection for this film, from start to finish.It doesn&#8217;t hurt that &#8216;Mary Poppins&#8217; is one of my favorite films of all time.  But then again, who doesn&#8217;t absolutely melt for that cinematic masterpiece.  The perfect blend of wit and charm coupled with a real emotional burst and some splendid life lessons, &#8216;Mary Poppins&#8217; is a magical and perfect representation of what Disney stood for and continues to stand for.A film about the collaborative creation of that big screen classic is daunting, for sure.I&#8217;m going to get the bad out of the way, because to me it is a little thing when taken into the context of the film.  Walt Disney was, as far as most accounts and records would indicate, a very selfish and reprehensible man.  He was a business man and a BS artist and had some unsavory political (or social) views and he was not a well thought of man, even by his employees.  He was a hard man to be around.  &#8216;Saving Mr. Banks&#8217; portrays him in the same golden light that his company has tried to cast him under since the very beginning.  Now, normally this would be a big detractor for me, but the truth of the matter is that this film is not about Walt Disney.  He is a supporting character and has marginal screen time, and the fact that he was desperate for a piece of Poppin&#8217;s pie has me hedging bets that he probably put his best foot forward during the time in question here.Still, it did feel like a real sugarcoating of the man, especially in his alone scenes, and made me wonder if Disney was the right studio to put out this movie.That being said, Disney really does make this movie so magical, so maybe they were the right studio.  Like I said, this movie isn&#8217;t even about Disney, and so having him be a faade isn&#8217;t a huge deal.  This movie is about P.L. Travers and her struggle to share her world, that repressed past that lies behind her masterpiece, and as such &#8216;Saving Mr. Banks&#8217; soars.  While some have balked that this film portrayed Travers&#8217; as an unsavory woman, I don&#8217;t agree.  She was prickly, yes, but she was also softened, and Emma Thompson is so remarkable (more on her in a minute) that she makes this woman so endearing and likable, despite her short fuse and sharp words.The film cuts between Travers childhood and her battle with Disney over the film rights to her book.  As the film progresses, and Travers goes in and out of her head, we see how the world of &#8216;Mary Poppins&#8217; was a form of escape that mirrored her own troubled childhood.But this is what I really loved about this movie.  Instead of going to easy, melodramatic route and giving us the expected overbearing depression of life with an alcoholic father and a suicidal mother (because Travers had both those things), &#8216;Saving Mr. Banks&#8217; paints these issues with a deft hand and actually softens its blows, creating a film that feels light on its feet, never bogged down by the weight of its contents, and yet never feels slight either.  The relationship between Travers and her father plays a central role here, creating a story about fathers and their mistakes and the daughters who love them and are left to pick up the pieces, and it does so in a way that feels authentic and soulful.  A lot of this is due to Colin Farrell&#8217;s heartwarming performance as Travers&#8217; father.  The portrayal of her father as an imperfect man, and not a soulless monster, was a really nice twist from the norm and gave a complexity to the film I didn&#8217;t expect.I honestly felt this was going to be a clich&eacute;d fluff film, and I almost passed on seeing this altogether because of that assumption.For me, this film lives and breathes in the marvelous performance given by Emma Thompson.  She is such a delightful breath of fresh air here.  She nails the biting sarcasm and prickly demeanor of Travers, and grabs hold of you from her very first scene, but it is in the warmer notes that her performance really shines.  Both of the &#8216;Let&#8217;s Go Fly a Kite&#8217; scenes left me in a puddle of tears, especially the first one (her foot movement, her delightful exuberance) and it was in that complete transformation that she won me over.The entire ensemble is great, with Giamatti, Novak, Whitford, Schwartzman and a young Annie Rose Buckley making delightful turns.  Hanks is a superb Disney, despite the white washing (and the horrible eye makeup that makes him look like he&#8217;s either Asian or had a botched facelift in certain angles) and makes the most out of his big confession scene (cue waterworks).This is not a popular opinion, I know.  I had a similar reaction to the maligned &#8216;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&#8217;, but I can&#8217;t help it.  &#8216;Saving Mr. Banks&#8217; won me over with its heart and soul, which it most certainly has.  What a tremendous year Disney just had!",5,Magic is the only word that can describe this beautiful film&#8230;,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,5423,"['know', 'was', 'supposed', 'hate', 'honestly',

1632375,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00BEIYSL4,Anthony L.,"[6, 8]","SAVING MR. BANKS is a lovely little movie filled with assured performances from excellent actors, soft music, beautiful cinematography, and a gentle pace. It is an easy film to watch, and easier to like. Though much of the nuances of plot were spoiled by the trailers (oh, the curse of the Internet!), I found myself lulled into the narrative, and came out refreshed from the film (if not a little irked at a few plot points).To get it over quickly, let's talk about those cons first. Then the pros. The main con I have with the film is about a little something called character arcs. Storywriting 101 says that your main character has to have an arc throughout the narrative - he/she has to change or grow. Ms. Travers did not. She began the film an insufferable dweeb, and remained an insufferable dweeb for the duration of the film. As the film progresses, and she remains mean and rude towards Disney and his staff no matter what their attempts to cajole her, entice her, please her, or impress her, it gets MORE than a LITTLE tiresome. It is only thanks toEmma Thompson's brilliant performance that I sympathized with her at all. Secondly, I only wish that the character of the REAL Mary Poppins was explored a bit more.But heck, enough of cons. On to pros... Firstly, the cast of MR. BANKS is absolutely awesome. Emma Thompson gives a brilliant and memorable performance as Ms. PL Travers (never Pamela!), an author with a very different sense of style than the Yanks, approached by Walt Disney for her book rights.Tom Hanksreminds us why he's perhaps the greatest American actor of his age, with a funny and moving portrayal of Disney himself. The supporting cast - a charismatic Colin Farrell, a warm Paul Giamatti, and BJ Novak and Jason Schwartzman as songwriters Dick and Bob Sherman give surprisingly subtle performances worthy of their high calibre.As I mentioned before, the soft score, the warm lighting and cinematography, and the calm assurance of veteran actors all add up to a funny and heart-warming film with excellent production values and morals, that will have you singing ""Let's go FLY a KITE!"" in no time. I know *I* was singing, humming, or dancing to it for hours. My rating? 4 (and a half) flying kites! Now to rewatchMary Poppins!P.S.

1632387,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00BEIYSL4,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 0]","When a movie like ""Saving Mr. Banks"" comes along, with it's nostalgic warmth, heart, humor, beautiful cinematography, and all around old school magic, we should embrace it, because they don't make 'em like this too much anymore. It's definitely a valentine to Disney lovers and movie lovers in general.""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a beautiful movie that takes place in both 1961 and, in flashbacks, in Australia in the early 1900s. The movie is about how the legendary film 'Mary Poppins' was made. It was a long (20 yrs!) and hard road. Emma Thompson stars as author P.L. Travers, who has not been interested in giving in to Walt Disney to film her precious books. But now, due to financial reasons, she gives in and decides to go to Los Angeles to see what happens. There, she constantly locks heads with the man himself (Tom Hanks), and the rest of his crew and staff. Demanding, picky and intolerant of most everything, Travers and Disney try to work together to finally get this movie on the screen.A lot of people have their opinions on Walt Disney and if this story is even 100% true. I do not know the history. Only from what I have seen in this movie. Taken on it's own, as a movie, SMB is a masterful piece of filmmaking. cast-wise, Emma Thompson is perfectly cast as Travers. She makes us feel the coldness that Travers displays when we first meet her and follow her through the film, and makes us feel (and maybe cry) by the end. The jumping around the timeline to her childhood in the early 1900s, and back to present day 1960s, is expertly done and weaves in seamlessly to what is presently going on in her world. It wonderfully explains where she came from and how she came to be the way she is. As for Mr. Hanks, you will have no problem beliving he is Disney. Hanks has really delivered a one-two punch this past year with this film and ""Captain Phillips"", the best streak he's had since the 90s. You forget you are watching Tom Hanks, and believe he is Uncle Walt, truly doing what he loves. The supporting cast, including Bradley Whitford, Colin Farrell and Paul Giamatti, also shine. It is a wonderful collection of actors. It is nearly impossible to not be completely and utterly moved by a few of these performances.From the real Disney studio lot, to actually filming in Disneyland, SMB also shines because of this authenticity. It feels and looks rich with it's own history. Director John Lee Hancock and his cinematographer don't hold back in making this a beautiful movie in the grand, old Hollywood style. Even though you have Travers' cynicism and biting remarks, it is a wonderfully happy movie, full with optimism and sentimentality. Don't let the hard, cold cynical critics and people of the world let you think that nostalgia and sentimentality is a bad thing. It's every bit as real and realistic as the harsh, gritty 'realistic' movies of today. There is wonderfulness in the world, and in the movies, and people want it.In the end, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is my favorite movie of 2013 by far, and definitely one of my top 5 favorite movies of the 2010s. No doubt. It's old school movie magic released in a medium where it seems like that is few and far between. Maybe the warm reception the movie got will make Hollywood take notice. It's an absolute shame that this movie was mostly overlooked by the Oscars. This movie is an absolute gem.",5,Saving Hollywood,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,3363,"['When', 'movie', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'along', 'nostalgic', 'warmth', 'heart', 'humor', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'around', 'old', 'school', 'magic', 'should', 'embrace', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', ""'em"", 'like', 'too', 'much', 'anymore', 'definitely', 'valentine', 'Disney', 'lovers', 'movie', 'lovers', 'general', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'place', '1961', 'flashbacks', 'Australia', 'early', '1900s', 'movie', 'how', 'legendary', 'film', ""'Mary"", 'Poppins', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'long', '20', 'yrs', 'hard', 'road', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'author', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'who', 'not', 'been', 'interested', 'giving', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'film', 'precious', 'books', 'now', 'due', 'financial', 'reasons', 'decides', 'go', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'see', 'what', 'constantly', 'heads', 'man', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'rest', 'crew', 'staff', 'Demanding', 'picky', 'intolerant', 'most', 'everything', 'Travers', 'Disney', 'try', 'work', 'together', 'finally', 'get', 'movie', 'screen.A', 'lot', 'people', 'have', 'opinions', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'story', 'even', '100', '%', 'true', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'history', 'Only', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'Taken', 'own', 'movie', 'SMB', 'masterful', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'cast-wise', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Travers', 'feel', 'coldness', 'Travers', 'displays', 'when', 'first', 'meet', 'follow', 'film', 'feel', 'maybe', 'cry', 'end', 'jumping', 'timeline', 'childhood', 'early', '1900s', 'back', 'present', 'day', '1960s', 'expertly', 'done', 'weaves', 'seamlessly', 'what', 'presently', 'going', 'world', 'wonderfully', 'where', 'came', 'how', 'came', 'be', 'way', 'Mr.', 'Hanks', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'beliving', 'Disney', 'Hanks', 'really', 'delivered', 'one-two', 'punch', 'past', 'year', 'film', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'best', 'streak', 'had', '90s', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'believe', 'Uncle', 'Walt', 'truly', 'doing', 'what', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'also', 'shine', 'wonderful', 'collection', 'actors', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'completely', 'utterly', 'moved', 'few', 'real', 'Disney', 'studio', 'lot', 'actually', 'filming', 'Disneyland', 'SMB', 'also', 'authenticity', 'rich', 'own', 'history', 'Director', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'cinematographer', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'making', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'grand', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'Even', 'have', 'Travers', 'cynicism', 'biting', 'remarks', 'wonderfully', 'happy', 'movie', 'full', 'optimism', 'sentimentality', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'hard', 'cold', 'cynical', 'critics', 'people', 'world', 'let', 'think', 'nostalgia', 'sentimentality', 'bad', 'thing', 'bit', 'real', 'realistic', 'harsh', 'gritty', ""'realistic"", 'movies', 'today', 'wonderfulness', 'world', 'movies', 'people', 'want', 'end', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'favorite', 'movie', '2013', 'far', 'definitely', 'one', 'top', '5', 'favorite', 'movies', '2010s', 'doubt', 'old', 'school', 'movie', 'magic', 'released', 'medium', 'where', 'few', 'far', 'Maybe', 'warm', 'reception', 'movie', 'got', 'will', 'make', 'Hollywood', 'take', 'notice', 'absolute', 'shame', 'movie', 'was', 'mostly', 'overlooked', 'Oscars', 'movie', 'absolute', 'gem']",Saving Mr. Banks

Emma Thompson is the standout actress in this awards-season frontrunner that has really gotten people talking.The story centers on P.L.

Travers reluctantly agrees to travel to Los Angeles and hear his plans. For two short weeks, we see the early stages of one of the most classic films ever made.Though I enjoyed the story and interaction between Hanks and Thompson, I didn't fully get behind this movie.

The story shifts back and forth from author P.L. Travers' childhood to the 1960s when she was brought to Hollywood by Walt Disney. The excellent Emma Thompson is at her best as Travers, who wants no part of Disney's cartoons and happy songs. Tom Hanks conveys Walt Disney's charm but also clearly shows his iron fist in a velvet glove. His employees treat him with a fear-tinged awe. It's very much oil-and-water; everything about the Americans annoys the very staid British author. The flashback scenes reveal pieces of the puzzle that came together as the series of treasured stories that have delighted readers for generations but now are best known from Disney's well-loved film. Colin Farrell does some of his best work as the charming father with serious character flaws. Annie Rose Buckley is heart-breaking as little Helen, whose love is powerless to save her father. Rachel Griffiths as Aunt Ellie is a key figure in the development of the entire story. My favorite scenes took place in the studio with the Sherman brothers and the film's writer (Jason Schwartzman, B.J. Novak and Bradley Whitford) turning themselves inside out trying to win Travers' appproval, but also those in the limousine with the chauffeur Ralph (Paul Giamatti) whose sunny optimism so grates on Mrs. Travers.

1632458,A2K5IXQT6RNX34,B00BEIYSL4,Christina Paige,"[1, 1]","Most of us have super powers, but most of us have only minor super powers, the kind that would get us sent to Sidekick classes as Sky High. One of my minor powers is to KNOW whether or not I will like a movie by its poster. I don&#8217;t even need a preview. I have never, ever been wrong; I have never been disappointed by a movie I knew I would like, and on the occasions when circumstances exerted a half-Nelson on me to attend a film on my no-go list, my gut instinct was absolutely justified. With Saving Mr. Banks, I didn&#8217;t even need the poster: the title was enough. I knew this was going to be a movie I&#8217;d love: truly, madly, deeply.The Mary Poppins books were in the same category as The Secret Garden and several of C.S Lewis&#8217;s Narnia books. All these stories helped inoculate the child-me to the very real dangers and hazards of life, but in ways that did not sully the soul or sicken the heart. Mary Lennox, Dickon, and the robin were better therapy than any psychoanalyst would have been; Mary Poppins awed me into good behavior much more effectively than any parental or grand-parental jaw. I respected her fierceness; I loved her view of realities, her secretiveness, her inherent mysteriousness. I loved the way she danced with Apollo, and was friends with stars. And I loved the stories where the children go off on naughty adventures by themselves, and when the babies talk with the visiting birds.I loved them enough that when I saw P. L. Travers&#8217; name on issues of Parabola magazine, I bought them to read her contributions. And I have her wonderful About the Sleeping Beauty, which gave a fascinating spin on the evil fairy.But I knew almost nothing about P.L. Travers the person.  So it was with a sense of keenest, almost breathless anticipation that I settled into the seat of the theatre to see this film, starring the one actress I trusted to faithfully render the author of Mary Poppins.We see flashbacks of Travers&#8217; childhood in Australia, where her father is a regional bank manager, while in 1961 she wrestles with a painful decision, driven by financial need. Walt Disney has been trying for 20 years to gain the movie rights to Mary Poppins, and for 20 years she has said no &#8211; not holding out for a better offer, just flatly refusing to let anyone muck about with her characters. Now she reluctantly agrees to be flown out to Walt Disney&#8217;s studio to be wooed, cajoled, entreated to sign a contract.Walt Disney is Travers&#8217; opposite: open where she is reserved, friendly where she vibrates between rude and hostile, tender where she is rock-hard, vulgar where she is refined  - the food trays and plushies!As they slowly, excruciatingly negotiate details of a Disney makeover &#8211; Travers loathes animation &#8211; it turns out that both of them have a proprietary interest in the father character, Mr. Banks.  Disney insists that he have a moustache; Travers wants him smooth-shaven.  Disney has had a hand in writing the script that portrays the father as distant, dismissive, focused on business above all else &#8211; as his own dad had been. Travers wants Mr. Banks to be like the whimsical, playful father she adored. Disney had been prepared for Travers to feel as territorial about Mary as he had felt about Mickey Mouse; the matter of the father&#8217;s role blindsides him, and almost derails the project. Once he realizes that they both have father issues, his genuine ability to care erodes her adamantine resolve, like water shaping stone.  Tom Hanks portrayal of &#8220;Call me Walt&#8221; Disney is subtle, nuanced, and powerful.The one flaw with this film is that it ultimately betrays P.L.Travers by implying that she eventually came around to liking that damnable animation sequence.I cannot stress enough how wonderful the supporting roles are played. Colin Farrell as Travers&#8217; father is the very heart of the movie, as a certain driver (played by Paul Giamatti) is the soul.  Farrell&#8217;s performance is so brilliant, so moving, that no words can do it justice, at least not without giving away spoilers.  You simply have to see for yourself. In addition, B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers who wrote the songs for so many of Disney&#8217;s films are like 1960s nerdly versions of the Coen brothers, and Annie Rose Buckley, who plays young Travers, is luminous.If you also have an eye to appreciate cinematography or costumes, you will realize that this film deserves Academy Award nominations for more than Best Actress, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor and Actress. It is so beautiful! And the contrast between turn of the century Australian and 1960s American outfits is perfectly presented. It&#8217;s downright terrifying, in fact. I recoiled in horror every time the film switched eras and the screen went from soft-focus panoramas of outback wilderness and people in hand-stitched, custom-made clothes to sharp-edged depictions of women with bouffant hair-dos in off-the rack outfits and torpedo bras. Every detail is perfect, from the scan of Travers&#8217; living room to the visit to Disney Land. Disney Studios used to be famous for their realistic dramas &#8211; Sounder comes to mind &#8211; and this gem of a film deserves to be ranked as one of Disney&#8217;s best.",5,Whose Dad Are We

1632459,A3N95R1VKWROWF,B00BEIYSL4,Christopher Schwinger,"[6, 17]","This is a highly fictionalized, but in some details quite accurate, movie about the attempt by Walt Disney to get Mary Poppins made, and the journey from stubbornness to openness by the author, Pamela Travers.  I had high hopes of Tom Hanks's performance as Walt Disney.  Man, he nails accents really well!  He can do Forrest Gump, Captain Phillips, and most impressively of all to me, Viktor Navorski on The Terminal.  And he didn't let me down as Walt Disney, mastering the rhythm and inflection of Disney.  I think he's one of the most versatile actors around today.  I was not familiar with Emma Thompson, but given the fact that the script caricatured her as someone who is unkind to everybody she meets and prissy to the utmost extreme, she gave the character sensitivity and humanity.The movie trailer made it look more like a comedy, but it actually is more of a drama.  Like many movies nowadays, it relies heavily on flashbacks, and they can be distracting, but I got used to 'em and saw how they ran concurrently with Travers's emotional journey.  I think as a movie, it works/is effective to structure the story around Travers opening up to Walt Disney's imagination and zest for life, in the context of Travers's painful childhood.  But since the character Travers is caricatured to the extent she is, I think it is unfair to her (though she is dead) to present such a one-sided story, as if her fussiness about every detail of the Mary Poppins movie was directly the fault of her unhappy childhood, which the movie overly insinuates.It felt like an oversimplification to me of the historical truth when she was portrayed as a sullen woman who was stand-offish to EVERYONE, while Walt Disney was the warm, jolly good guy.  Walt was a master showman, and a decisive businessman, but I have a hunch he wasn't nearly as warm toward her, who was constantly nitpicking about details, as the movie makes it seem.  But Tom Hanks mastered what the script gave him, and so did Emma Thompson.  And it's not a bad script, but it is not as historically accurate as it purports to be, and I think that's not very fair to Travers.  Her obsession with creative control is common, not confined to people who have bitter childhoods, and I think if they hadn't caricatured her so much with fictionalized incidents like fussing at a flight attendant (twice!) and making her so neurotic about anything bright and sunny, it would have been a better movie.  I hate the movie Amadeus because of its portrayal of Mozart as a totally obnoxious man, which even before I read about its inaccuracies I knew was oversimplistic.  You can capture the qualities of a character in a movie role but miss the essence, and I think that in this case, the essence of the very complex Travers and Disney was missing, even though personality traits were captured.  But unlike Amadeus, I enjoyed Saving Mr. Banks as a movie, even if not in a historical way.  The real Travers's main cause for being so shrewish at the Disney studio was a different creative vision.  She wanted a film with serious themes based in the Great Depression and her own rough childhood.  I've read that her Mary Poppins books are much more serious in tone than Disney's colorful and optimistic movie.  She figured that as the creator, she could dictate every detail.Summary:  Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are both outstanding, and I could go on with praise for the actors for the Sherman Brothers and some other characters.  As far as historical accuracy goes, it is hagiographic (depicting as saintly) of Walt, who wasn't that warm towards Travers, and oversimplifies Travers as a shrewish woman when her main cause for being so on the Mary Poppins movie collaboration was a different creative vision.  It's a fun movie in ways, though.  It has very good cinematography that keeps it really engaging, and it's fun watching Tom Hanks as Walt Disney.",3,"A one-sided portrayal of Walt as nice gentleman and Travers as nasty prude, but a good movie in other ways (3 1/2 stars)",1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,3896,"['highly', 'fictionalized', 'details', 'quite', 'accurate', 'movie', 'attempt', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'get', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'made', 'journey', 'stubbornness', 'openness', 'author', 'Pamela', 'Travers', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'performance', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Man', 'accents', 'really', 'well', 'can', 'do', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'most', 'impressively', 'Viktor', 'Navorski', 'Terminal', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'mastering', 'rhythm', 'inflection', 'Disney', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'versatile', 'actors', 'today', 'was', 'not', 'familiar', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'given', 'fact', 'script', 'caricatured', 'someone', 'who', 'unkind', 'everybody', 'meets', 'prissy', 'utmost', 'extreme', 'gave', 'character', 'sensitivity', 'humanity.The', 'movie', 'trailer', 'made', 'look', 'more', 'comedy', 'actually', 'more', 'drama', 'many', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'heavily', 'flashbacks', 'can', 'be', 'distracting', 'got', 'used', ""'em"", 'saw', 'how', 'ran', 'concurrently', 'Travers', 'emotional', 'journey', 'think', 'movie', 'works/is', 'effective', 'structure', 'story', 'Travers', 'opening', 'up', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'imagination', 'zest', 'life', 'context', 'Travers', 'painful', 'childhood', 'character', 'Travers', 'caricatured', 'extent', 'think', 'unfair', 'dead', 'present', 'such', 'one-sided', 'story', 'fussiness', 'detail', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'movie', 'was', 'directly', 'fault', 'unhappy', 'childhood', 'movie', 'overly', 'insinuates.It', 'felt', 'oversimplification', 'historical', 'truth', 'when', 'was', 'portrayed', 'sullen', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'stand-offish', 'EVERYONE', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'was', 'warm', 'jolly', 'good', 'guy', 'Walt', 'was', 'master', 'showman', 'decisive', 'businessman', 'have', 'hunch', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'warm', 'who', 'was', 'constantly', 'nitpicking', 'details', 'movie', 'seem', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'mastered', 'what', 'script', 'gave', 'so', 'did', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'not', 'bad', 'script', 'not', 'historically', 'accurate', 'be', 'think', 'not', 'very', 'fair', 'Travers', 'obsession', 'creative', 'control', 'common', 'not', 'confined', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'bitter', 'childhoods', 'think', 'had', ""n't"", 'caricatured', 'so', 'much', 'fictionalized', 'incidents', 'fussing', 'flight', 'attendant', 'twice', 'making', 'so', 'neurotic', 'anything', 'bright', 'sunny', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'movie', 'hate', 'movie', 'Amadeus', 'portrayal', 'Mozart', 'totally', 'obnoxious', 'man', 'even', 'read', 'inaccuracies', 'knew', 'was', 'oversimplistic', 'can', 'capture', 'qualities', 'character', 'movie', 'role', 'miss', 'essence', 'think', 'case', 'essence', 'very', 'complex', 'Travers', 'Disney', 'was', 'missing', 'even', 'personality', 'traits', 'were', 'captured', 'Amadeus', 'enjoyed', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'movie', 'even', 'not', 'historical', 'way', 'real', 'Travers', 'main', 'cause', 'being', 'so', 'shrewish', 'Disney', 'studio', 'was', 'different', 'creative', 'vision', 'wanted', 'film', 'serious', 'themes', 'based', 'Great', 'Depression', 'own', 'rough', 'childhood', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'books', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'Disney', 'colorful', 'optimistic', 'movie', 'figured', 'creator', 'could', 'dictate', 'detail.Summary', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'are', 'outstanding', 'could', 'go', 'praise', 'actors', 'Sherman', 'Brothers', 'other', 'characters', 'As', 'far', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'hagiographic', 'depicting', 'as', 'saintly', 'Walt', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'warm', 'towards', 'Travers', 'Travers', 'shrewish', 'woman', 'when', 'main', 'cause', 'being', 'so', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'movie', 'collaboration', 'was', 'different', 'creative', 'vision', 'fun', 'movie', 'ways', 'though', 'very', 'good', 'cinematography', 'really', 'engaging', 'fun', 'watching', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Walt', 'Disney']",Saving Mr. Banks

The story line, when you read what it is about or watch the trailers, it is hard to see how you could enjoy the film...except that with Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks, most of whatever they choose to act in is better than most. But the acting and nice photography holds you to the story, until you can feel the story taking off on it's own.Essentially, the lady that wrote Mary Poppins, didn't have a very nice childhood and it soured her. She made her story, her substitute family. That substitute family were the only people she let in her life so she wouldn't get hurt. So when Disney, hounded and hounded her to get her to let them make a movie out of the book; only dire need for money made her consider it.When you are trying to make a move for American families, as Disney did it; you want fun, music, characters, fantasy, animation... But this threatened the original story and was resisted by the author, so much so that tension in the viewers of &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; becomes uncomfortable. We get flashbacks to the childhood that caused the problems in the life of the author of Mary Poppins: alcoholic father ...to the point he drinks himself dead, mother falling apart, and a no-nonsense aunt to the rescue of the family.Mr. Banks, the father in Mary Poppins is a banker, like the author's father was. Even in Mary Poppins he was not very likable...though the author idealized her own father who celebrated who she was in her childhood...even though he was an alcoholic; and discounted her own helpless mother. The trauma to the author came, because of the horrible situation and disgrace in which her father left the family. She loved him...but how could she love him? That is where the title, and the main story line of this film lies, in saving Mr. Banks, the father, in her memory...and in her story.If you remember, at the end of Mary Poppins, Mr. Banks realizes that his family is the most important part of his life and he stops being such a prick. As the author, with the help of Disney, the writers, the environment changes the story so that Mr. Banks becomes worthy of love again, she works through her own issues to become whole again. And by doing this in &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; we are all made a little more whole, a little more happy, a little more at peace with the bad things that have happened in our own lives.",4,Enjoyable,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,2372,"['Good', 'acting', 'course', 'story', 'line', 'when', 'read', 'what', 'watch', 'trailers', 'hard', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'most', 'choose', 'act', 'better', 'most', 'acting', 'nice', 'photography', 'story', 'can', 'feel', 'story', 'taking', 'off', 'own.Essentially', 'lady', 'wrote', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'nice', 'childhood', 'soured', 'made', 'story', 'substitute', 'family', 'substitute', 'family', 'were', 'only', 'people', 'let', 'life', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'hurt', 'So', 'when', 'Disney', 'hounded', 'hounded', 'get', 'let', 'make', 'movie', 'book', 'only', 'dire', 'need', 'money', 'made', 'consider', 'it.When', 'are', 'trying', 'make', 'move', 'American', 'families', 'Disney', 'did', 'want', 'fun', 'music', 'characters', 'fantasy', 'animation', 'threatened', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'resisted', 'author', 'so', 'much', 'tension', 'viewers', '34', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', 'becomes', 'uncomfortable', 'get', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'caused', 'problems', 'life', 'author', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'point', 'dead', 'mother', 'falling', 'apart', 'no-nonsense', 'aunt', 'rescue', 'family.Mr', 'Banks', 'father', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'banker', 'author', 'father', 'was', 'Even', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'likable', 'author', 'idealized', 'own', 'father', 'who', 'celebrated', 'who', 'was', 'childhood', 'even', 'was', 'alcoholic', 'discounted', 'own', 'helpless', 'mother', 'trauma', 'author', 'came', 'horrible', 'situation', 'disgrace', 'father', 'left', 'family', 'loved', 'how', 'could', 'love', 'where', 'title', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'film', 'saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'father', 'memory', 'story.If', 'remember', 'end', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'family', 'most', 'important', 'part', 'life', 'being', 'such', 'prick', 'author', 'help', 'Disney', 'writers', 'environment', 'story', 'so', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'worthy', 'love', 'again', 'own', 'issues', 'become', 'whole', 'again', 'doing', '34', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', 'are', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'whole', 'little', 'more', 'happy', 'little', 'more', 'peace', 'bad', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'own', 'lives']",Saving Mr. Banks

1632476,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00BEIYSL4,C. Sawin,"[5, 6]","If you've ever seen Marc Forster's (&#34;World War Z,&#34; &#34;Stranger Than Fiction&#34;) semi-biographical drama &#34;Finding Neverland&#34; from 2004, then &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; may remind you of it. &#34;Finding Neverland&#34; is the story of how Scottish writer J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) created Peter Pan. In &#34;Saving Mr. Banks,&#34; P.L. Travers has already created Mary Poppins but you're seeing the inception of a beloved film classic come to life. John Lee Hancock's (&#34;The Blind Side&#34;) latest differs in how musical it is. Production spirals into absolute turmoil over the Mary Poppins film thanks to how difficult Travers is with the world she's created. The music often introduces this lighthearted atmosphere that feels very carefree, but then is often immediately crushed and decimated by Travers who has a way of bringing this depressing storm cloud into the room. It's an ongoing struggle throughout the film that effortlessly strings you along. If you've ever created anything in your life that you're passionate about then you can understand where Travers is coming from, but part of you desperately wants to see Travers cave and allow this film to be made. You find yourself rooting for both sides and in no way is that a bad thing.Part of what makes &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; so engrossing is how bits and pieces of Travers' childhood are interwoven in between the sequences taking place in the present. Her childhood mostly revolves around how close she was to her father Travers Goff (Colin Farrell) and how haunted by the demons of drinking ripped their family apart. Farrell gives what is arguably his most impeccable performance to date. Goff tells the most fanciful and elaborate stories to his daughter, is extremely creative when it comes to using his imagination to keep his children entertained, and puts playtime above everything else. Unfortunately, he's also extremely irresponsible and doesn't take care of himself properly. Farrell's portrayal of the character is sublime. Seeing how these events affect the adult Travers battling Walt Disney is also quite intriguing.Tom Hanks is very warm and approachable as Walt Disney. He seems to have a very specific vision set in his mind of where he wants to take Mary Poppins, but Travers will have none of it. His smoking is what's getting the most attention; mostly because Walt Disney was a chain smoker and the film never shows him smoking. You hear his smoker's cough a handful of times and see him put out a single cigarette. Hank's performance is the most impressive when he's reminiscing about the worn Mary Poppins book he had growing up, his Mickey Mouse story, and his conversation with Travers about who she is and what her Mary Poppins story is really about. Tom Hanks has this soft voice that reels you in and a glimmer in his eye that always makes you feel like he sees the magic in everything.&#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; is a whimsical and charming film that seizes hold of your childhood. The historical comedic drama tightly clutches on to the magic of what you grew up with and never lets it go. It's the cinematic equivalent of a heart of gold with absolutely exceptional performances from Tom Hanks, Colin Farrell, and Emma Thompson.",4,A symphonic struggle overflowing with sincerity,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,3249,"[""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Marc', 'Forster', '34', 'World', 'War', 'Z', '34', '34', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', '34', 'semi-biographical', 'drama', '34', 'Finding', 'Neverland', '34', '2004', 'then', '34', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', 'may', 'remind', '34', 'Finding', 'Neverland', '34', 'story', 'how', 'Scottish', 'writer', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'created', 'Peter', 'Pan', '34', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'already', 'created', 'Mary', 'Poppins', ""'re"", 'seeing', 'inception', 'beloved', 'film', 'classic', 'come', 'life', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', '34', 'Blind', 'Side', '34', 'latest', 'differs', 'how', 'musical', 'Production', 'spirals', 'absolute', 'turmoil', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'film', 'thanks', 'how', 'difficult', 'Travers', 'world', 'created', 'music', 'often', 'lighthearted', 'atmosphere', 'very', 'carefree', 'then', 'often', 'immediately', 'crushed', 'decimated', 'Travers', 'who', 'way', 'bringing', 'depressing', 'storm', 'cloud', 'room', 'ongoing', 'struggle', 'film', 'effortlessly', 'along', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'created', 'anything', 'life', ""'re"", 'passionate', 'then', 'can', 'understand', 'where', 'Travers', 'coming', 'part', 'desperately', 'see', 'Travers', 'cave', 'allow', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'find', 'rooting', 'sides', 'way', 'bad', 'thing.Part', 'what', '34', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', 'so', 'engrossing', 'how', 'bits', 'pieces', 'Travers', 'childhood', 'are', 'interwoven', 'sequences', 'taking', 'place', 'present', 'childhood', 'mostly', 'how', 'close', 'was', 'father', 'Travers', 'Goff', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'how', 'haunted', 'demons', 'drinking', 'ripped', 'family', 'apart', 'Farrell', 'what', 'arguably', 'most', 'impeccable', 'performance', 'date', 'Goff', 'most', 'fanciful', 'elaborate', 'stories', 'daughter', 'extremely', 'creative', 'when', 'using', 'imagination', 'keep', 'children', 'entertained', 'playtime', 'everything', 'else', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'extremely', 'irresponsible', ""n't"", 'take', 'care', 'properly', 'Farrell', 'portrayal', 'character', 'sublime', 'Seeing', 'how', 'events', 'affect', 'adult', 'Travers', 'battling', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'also', 'quite', 'intriguing.Tom', 'Hanks', 'very', 'warm', 'approachable', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'have', 'very', 'specific', 'vision', 'set', 'mind', 'where', 'take', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Travers', 'will', 'have', 'none', 'smoking', 'what', 'getting', 'most', 'attention', 'mostly', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'was', 'chain', 'smoker', 'film', 'never', 'smoking', 'hear', 'smoker', 'cough', 'handful', 'times', 'see', 'put', 'out', 'single', 'cigarette', 'Hank', 'performance', 'most', 'impressive', 'when', 'reminiscing', 'worn', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'book', 'had', 'growing', 'up', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'story', 'conversation', 'Travers', 'who', 'what', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'story', 'really', 'about', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'soft', 'voice', 'glimmer', 'eye', 'always', 'feel', 'magic', 'everything.', '34', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', 'whimsical', 'charming', 'film', 'hold', 'childhood', 'historical', 'comedic', 'drama', 'tightly', 'magic', 'what', 'grew', 'up', 'never', 'go', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'heart', 'gold', 'absolutely', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Emma', 'Thompson']",Saving Mr. Banks

1632489,ASQ8KNNP3A7FP,B00BEIYSL4,"Danusha V. Goska ""Save Send Delete""","[45, 61]","&#34;Savings Mr. Banks&#34; is worth seeing for Emma Thompson's peerless performance as &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; author PL Travers. That Thompson was not nominated for a best actor Academy Award is a crime. Thompson's performance is one of the most compelling and convincing performances I've ever seen.Thompson plays PL Travers as a witch, and I'm using the nice version of the word. You know what word I really mean. Thompson's Travers is thoroughly believable. This isn't a cartoon villainess. This isn't Cruella DaVille or Maleficent. This is a woman you could imagine having as a boss or a neighbor. You'd do everything you could to avoid her. She doesn't learn any lesson. She doesn't reveal that we are all warm and fuzzy if you just get close enough.Some have criticized &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; for this reason. They say that it's sexist to depict a successful woman author as being a witch. Baloney. It would be sexist to depict her as warm and cuddly. Women can be unpleasant. I know plenty of women like Travers. It isn't liberated to insist that all women are nice. Plenty of women are not nice at all.I found Thompson's depiction of Travers to be so powerful that the rest of the film didn't measure up, for me. Part of the film takes place in 1961. Travers is in Hollywood, working with Disney studios on their film adaptation of her book &#34;Mary Poppins.&#34; Part of the film is a series of flashbacks to Travers' childhood in Australia. In the flashbacks, Colin Farrell plays Travers' alcoholic father. The flashbacks didn't work for me. They had the feel of an afterschool special. Everyone was so good looking, especially Colin Farrell, even while suffering the health effects of alcoholism. Annie Rose Buckley, who plays the author as a child, is cherubically beautiful. The scenes depicting the alcoholic father disappointing and humiliating his daughter, and breaking her heart, did not affect me at all. They felt paint-by-numbers &#8211; oh, this is the predictable scene where the little girl realizes her father is a loser.The 1961 scenes in Hollywood worked much better. Paul Giamatti is amazing in the small part of Travers' limo driver. He brings a wallop of humanity and poignancy to his role that really swept me off my feet. The two develop a real rapport, and they could have taken up much more of the film. Jason Schwartzman and BJ Novak are also brilliant as Robert and Richard Sherman, who wrote the songs for Mary Poppins. In one scene, Travers objects to Robert Sherman's walking with a cane. The film doesn't mention this; I wish it had. Sherman was only 19 or 20 years old when he participated in the liberation of Dachau. He was shot during the war. That's why he walked with a cane.Tom Hanks as Walt Disney didn't really work for me. Walt Disney was a totemic figure from my childhood. I remember him, in his TV appearances, as rather godlike &#8211; avuncular and yet distant, impenetrable. While watching Emma Thompson as PL Travers, I got the sense that I was watching something like the real PL Travers &#8211; a real, complex, human being. While watching Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, I got the sense that I was watching Tom Hanks play a sanitized version of Walt Disney. &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; was very brave in its depiction of Travers, but very vanilla in its depiction of Walt. Giamatti as the fictional limo driver had more depth and complexity.The movie is most valuable as a character piece. It tries to say some big things about how people live through sorrow, like Travers' childhood, and survive that sorrow by creating art about it, like &#34;Mary Poppins.&#34; That big idea really didn't wash for me. I know it's possibly true, but that message just didn't grab me, so the movie was not a ten, but it's certainly worth viewing for Thompson's performance, for her interplay with Giamatti and the Sherman brothers as played by Schwartzman and Novak.",3,It Can Be Feminist to Depict a Witch as a Witch,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",2014,3910,"['34', 'Savings', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', 'seeing', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'peerless', 'performance', '34', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '34', 'author', 'PL', 'Travers', 'Thompson', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'best', 'actor', 'Academy', 'Award', 'crime', 'Thompson', 'performance', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'convincing', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.Thompson', 'plays', 'PL', 'Travers', 'witch', ""'m"", 'using', 'nice', 'version', 'word', 'know', 'what', 'word', 'really', 'mean', 'Thompson', 'Travers', 'thoroughly', 'believable', ""n't"", 'cartoon', 'villainess', ""n't"", 'Cruella', 'DaVille', 'Maleficent', 'woman', 'could', 'imagine', 'having', 'boss', 'neighbor', ""'d"", 'do', 'everything', 'could', 'avoid', ""n't"", 'learn', 'lesson', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'are', 'warm', 'fuzzy', 'just', 'get', 'close', 'enough.Some', 'have', 'criticized', '34', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', 'reason', 'say', 'sexist', 'depict', 'successful', 'woman', 'author', 'being', 'witch', 'Baloney', 'would', 'be', 'sexist', 'depict', 'warm', 'cuddly', 'Women', 'can', 'be', 'unpleasant', 'know', 'plenty', 'women', 'Travers', ""n't"", 'liberated', 'insist', 'women', 'are', 'nice', 'Plenty', 'women', 'are', 'not', 'nice', 'all.I', 'found', 'Thompson', 'depiction', 'Travers', 'be', 'so', 'powerful', 'rest', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'Part', 'film', 'place', '1961', 'Travers', 'Hollywood', 'working', 'Disney', 'studios', 'film', 'adaptation', 'book', '34', 'Mary', 'Poppins.', '34', 'Part', 'film', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'Travers', 'childhood', 'Australia', 'flashbacks', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Travers', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'flashbacks', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'had', 'feel', 'afterschool', 'special', 'Everyone', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'looking', 'especially', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'even', 'suffering', 'health', 'effects', 'alcoholism', 'Annie', 'Rose', 'Buckley', 'who', 'author', 'child', 'cherubically', 'beautiful', 'scenes', 'depicting', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'disappointing', 'humiliating', 'daughter', 'breaking', 'heart', 'did', 'not', 'affect', 'felt', 'paint-by-numbers', '8211', 'oh', 'predictable', 'scene', 'where', 'little', 'girl', 'father', 'loser.The', '1961', 'scenes', 'Hollywood', 'worked', 'much', 'better', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'amazing', 'small', 'part', 'Travers', 'limo', 'driver', 'wallop', 'humanity', 'poignancy', 'role', 'really', 'swept', 'off', 'feet', 'two', 'develop', 'real', 'rapport', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'up', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'BJ', 'Novak', 'are', 'also', 'brilliant', 'Robert', 'Richard', 'Sherman', 'who', 'wrote', 'songs', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'one', 'scene', 'Travers', 'Robert', 'Sherman', 'walking', 'cane', 'film', ""n't"", 'mention', 'wish', 'had', 'Sherman', 'was', 'only', '19', '20', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'participated', 'liberation', 'Dachau', 'was', 'shot', 'war', 'why', 'walked', 'cane.Tom', 'Hanks', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'was', 'totemic', 'figure', 'childhood', 'remember', 'TV', 'appearances', 'rather', 'godlike', '8211', 'avuncular', 'yet', 'distant', 'impenetrable', 'watching', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'PL', 'Travers', 'got', 'sense', 'was', 'watching', 'something', 'real', 'PL', 'Travers', '8211', 'real', 'complex', 'human', 'being', 'watching', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'got', 'sense', 'was', 'watching', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'play', 'sanitized', 'version', 'Walt', 'Disney', '34', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', 'was', 'very', 'brave', 'depiction', 'Travers', 'very', 'vanilla', 'depiction', 'Walt', 'Giamatti', 'fictional', 'limo', 'driver', 'had', 'more', 'depth', 'complexity.The', 'movie', 'most', 'valuable', 'character', 'piece', 'say', 'big', 'things', 'how', 'people', 'live', 'sorrow', 'Travers', 'childhood', 'survive', 'sorrow', 'creating', 'art', '34', 'Mary', 'Poppins.', '34', 'big', 'idea', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'wash', 'know', 'possibly', 'true', 'message', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'grab', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'ten', 'certainly', 'worth', 'viewing', 'Thompson', 'performance', 'interplay', 'Giamatti', 'Sherman', 'brothers', 'played', 'Schwartzman', 'Novak']",Saving Mr. Banks

1632491,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00BEIYSL4,Darren,"[0, 4]","And that is ... well, I'm not entirely sure.  I think this movie is intended for those Baby Boomers who remember &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; when it was first released, who remember the living, jovial Walt Disney in his undertaker's suit, who remember the Disneyland Park when it more or less resembled one of those county fairs in Missouri where Disney grew up.  Whom it's not for: kids.  They'll have precious little interest in an elderly British lady's grappling with the demons of her past, which is really the subject of the film.  As such, it's also undoubtedly why Disney Corp. signed on to the picture in the first place.  It's not *about* the man himself or, more importantly, his legacy.  Walt and his world are really rather ancillary to what's going on here.Strangely, the movie might be best for people like me who have never seen &#34;Mary Poppins&#34;.  We exist.  I guess I was a pretty macho little tyke: I distinctly remember being about 4 years of age back in the early 70s when this film came on network TV, and I also distinctly remember having no interest in it: it appeared to be about a lady flying around with an umbrella.  No thanks.  My mother was pretty excited about it and kept trying to coax me to watch it, but I was already spoiled on Warner Brothers, Tom & Jerry, and Rocky and Bullwinkle.  I can't be the only GenXer who was, and still is, &#34;meh&#34; about the whole Disney thing.  Blame it on the cartoons on TV in the 70s.  How on earth is Goofy going to compare to Bugs Bunny putting a stick of dynamite in Elmer Fudd's birthday cake?  I always thought Disney was boring and tame.  The only character I liked was Donald Duck, because he was usually angry about something.  (I still preferred Daffy, though.)Anyway, what I am interested in are the sources of art, and no one can accuse &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; of not doing its damnedest to get to the bottom of Mary Poppins.  More than half of the picture is in flashback to turn-of-the-20th-century Australia, where the Goff family find themselves living on a homestead in virtual isolation.  Colin Farrell is the &#34;Celtic&#34; (his term -- I think they were originally from Ireland) father, sprinkling fairy dust and leprechaun's gold all over his impressionable daughter Helen, with whom he shares a special bond.  He was bright enough to become a bank manager, but boredom and alcohol ruin him soon enough.  The mother of the family -- no Rock of Gibraltar herself -- eventually calls in her sister, who arrives bringing a parasol and purpose to their shabby lives.  And there's your inspiration.The main problem I had with all this was the insistent need to analyze WHY Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers is such a grumpy lady, and HOW she can be made to be happy again.  Tom Hanks as Disney provides the answers near the end, after giving us a sob story about delivering newspapers as an eight-year-old in the bitterly cold Missouri winter.  And the answer seems to be ... turn over your creations to Walt Disney; you'll feel much better, and you'll start wearing bright floral blouses, the better to highlight your new tan.  In my opinion, there wasn't a &#34;problem&#34; to be solved in the first place.  Who says an old British lady can't be grumpy?  And if the clips I've seen over the years are any guide, Disney's &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; IS cheesy, and Thompson (and the real-life Travers) were right to roll their eyes in utter annoyance.  Well, at least the journey was an intermittently interesting one, nicely performed by all the actors.  Thompson is perfect, of course -- she can play this kind of role in her sleep (and she probably did, here).  Hanks plays himself playing Disney, which works for the picture.  Paul Giamatti has lost a lot of weight -- glad to see that.3 out of 5.",3,Enjoyable for what it is,1395532800,"03 23, 2014",2014,3788,"['well', ""'m"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'think', 'movie', 'intended', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'who', 'remember', '34', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '34', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'who', 'remember', 'living', 'jovial', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'undertaker', 'suit', 'who', 'remember', 'Disneyland', 'Park', 'when', 'more', 'less', 'resembled', 'one', 'county', 'fairs', 'Missouri', 'where', 'Disney', 'grew', 'up', 'not', 'kids', ""'ll"", 'have', 'precious', 'little', 'interest', 'elderly', 'British', 'lady', 'grappling', 'demons', 'past', 'really', 'subject', 'film', 'such', 'also', 'undoubtedly', 'why', 'Disney', 'Corp.', 'signed', 'picture', 'first', 'place', 'not', '*about*', 'man', 'more', 'importantly', 'legacy', 'Walt', 'world', 'are', 'really', 'rather', 'ancillary', 'what', 'going', 'here.Strangely', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', '34', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '34', 'exist', 'guess', 'was', 'pretty', 'macho', 'little', 'tyke', 'distinctly', 'remember', 'being', '4', 'years', 'age', 'back', 'early', '70s', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'network', 'TV', 'also', 'distinctly', 'remember', 'having', 'interest', 'appeared', 'be', 'lady', 'flying', 'around', 'umbrella', 'thanks', 'mother', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'kept', 'trying', 'coax', 'watch', 'was', 'already', 'spoiled', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'Rocky', 'Bullwinkle', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'only', 'GenXer', 'who', 'was', 'still', '34', 'meh', '34', 'whole', 'Disney', 'thing', 'Blame', 'cartoons', 'TV', '70s', 'How', 'earth', 'Goofy', 'going', 'compare', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'putting', 'stick', 'dynamite', 'Elmer', 'Fudd', 'birthday', 'cake', 'always', 'thought', 'Disney', 'was', 'boring', 'tame', 'only', 'character', 'liked', 'was', 'Donald', 'Duck', 'was', 'usually', 'angry', 'something', 'still', 'preferred', 'Daffy', 'though', 'Anyway', 'what', 'am', 'interested', 'are', 'sources', 'art', 'one', 'can', 'accuse', '34', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', 'not', 'doing', 'damnedest', 'get', 'bottom', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'More', 'half', 'picture', 'flashback', 'turn-of-the-20th-century', 'Australia', 'where', 'Goff', 'family', 'find', 'living', 'homestead', 'virtual', 'isolation', 'Colin', 'Farrell', '34', 'Celtic', '34', 'term', 'think', 'were', 'originally', 'Ireland', 'father', 'sprinkling', 'fairy', 'dust', 'leprechaun', 'gold', 'impressionable', 'daughter', 'Helen', 'whom', 'shares', 'special', 'bond', 'was', 'bright', 'enough', 'become', 'bank', 'manager', 'boredom', 'alcohol', 'ruin', 'soon', 'enough', 'mother', 'family', 'Rock', 'Gibraltar', 'eventually', 'sister', 'who', 'bringing', 'parasol', 'purpose', 'shabby', 'lives', 'inspiration.The', 'main', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'insistent', 'need', 'analyze', 'WHY', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'such', 'grumpy', 'lady', 'HOW', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'be', 'happy', 'again', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Disney', 'answers', 'end', 'giving', 'sob', 'story', 'delivering', 'newspapers', 'eight-year-old', 'bitterly', 'cold', 'Missouri', 'winter', 'answer', 'be', 'turn', 'creations', 'Walt', 'Disney', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'much', 'better', ""'ll"", 'start', 'wearing', 'bright', 'floral', 'blouses', 'better', 'highlight', 'new', 'tan', 'opinion', 'was', ""n't"", '34', 'problem', '34', 'be', 'solved', 'first', 'place', 'Who', 'old', 'British', 'lady', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'grumpy', 'clips', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years', 'are', 'guide', 'Disney', '34', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '34', 'IS', 'cheesy', 'Thompson', 'real-life', 'Travers', 'were', 'right', 'roll', 'eyes', 'utter', 'annoyance', 'Well', 'least', 'journey', 'was', 'intermittently', 'interesting', 'one', 'nicely', 'performed', 'actors', 'Thompson', 'perfect', 'course', 'can', 'play', 'kind', 'role', 'sleep', 'probably', 'did', 'here', 'Hanks', 'playing', 'Disney', 'picture', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'lost', 'lot', 'weight', 'glad', 'see', 'that.3', '5']",Saving Mr. Banks
1632492,ADNLUVGELG6DM,B00BEIYSL4,Darryl Tern,"[0, 0]","As unusual as sliding up the banister, P.L. Travers abject herself working alongside Walt Disney and his merry crew, the Sherman Brothers and Don DaGradi to bring Marry Poppins from the east winds to the sunny west screen. Given the rights to review the script before filming, Travers seized every opportunity to criticize the music, wardrobe, and even Disney himself in hopes to give her precious &#34;Marry Poppins&#34; the justification on how she wrote the story and the message it evokes. With two powerhouses of storytelling, Disney and Travers are on opposites ends on what Marry Poppins is about. And without explanation she leaves Disney and his crew to find the answer and who P.L. Travers is. And in an ironic turn Travers is lost herself with Disney.The amazing supporting cast: Colin Farrell, Bradley Whitford, BJ Norvak, Jason Schwartzman, Kathy Baker, Ruth Wilson, Paul Giamatti and Melanie Paxson were all spectacular and held their own with Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks. The film did a wonderful job portraying the Sherman Brothers musical and amazing talents in songwriting and DaGrati visual script writing. A memorable scene was the introduction to the song &#34;Let's Go Fly a Kite&#34; that would no doubt make the audience lips utter the lyrics. There was also a nice relationship between Travers (Thompson) and Ralph her cab driver (Giamatti).The story behind the making of Disney's &#34;Marry Poppins&#34; was enjoyable and a major flashback to the first time you had seen the movie. It was exciting to see how Travers was treated at Disney studios with cake and tea and what the Disney staff went threw to please her. Travers was not an easy person to talk to let alone be friends with. She had a strong attitude forwards everything and there was anger and humor in it and that mostly came from Emma Thompson's performance. There were many appealing part of the movie like how the songs were written (Spoonfull of Sugar) and Travers relationship with her father. And like the original Marry Poppins books, there was some dark elements that in turn became life lessons. Although the film left out Disney's avoidance to Travers's suggestions (hence her disapproval of the animation) the film shows hers dismay but was somewhat ambiguous; either she cried over the film or how it reminded her of her father or the songs.There is no doubt that the movie dramatizes Travers's experiences with Disney but it doesn't ignore who Travers was. Like Disney she is ruthless, complex, critical, and imaginative when it comes to storytelling. &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; is a character film depicting Travers's troubled childhood in Australia through flashbacks while connecting them to her odd personality and her literature skills. Most importantly these flashbacks are tremendously key factors for her inspirations of &#34;Marry Poppins.&#34; The Banks family in the books are Travers's family- moreover- the people they are not. And for Travers, it is like giving her family away especially to a man who color- wash everything even the darkest time. She is obligated to be very critical to the filmmaking process since she wants the &#34;gravitas&#34; within the script. While Disney is a key opponent to persuade Travers in giving him the rights, he is not fully flushed out as he could had been but his presence on screen is effective. Unlike Travers, Disney likes making a spectacle of himself adding on to their everlasting clashes. The scene with them at Disneyland was a marvelous colorful historic experience and a throwback to what is known as a &#34;simpler&#34; era. One of the highlights of the two is their conversation at Travers's home, giving the audience a poignant look into Walt's childhood, but there could had been more to Disney than what was shown in the film.It is interesting that the characters in the movie can relate to one another and connects to the Banks family or the &#34;Marry Poppins&#34; book.

1632495,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00BEIYSL4,David Baldwin,"[7, 9]","""Saving Mr. Banks"" was not the film I expected it to be.  The advertisements of it depict a paternal Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) butting heads futilely with a headstrong British matron, P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), about translating her children's book to the big screen.  The impression you get is this is a comedy with some dramatic overtones.  Nothing could cut further from the truth because this film tackles deeper themes.  It's about adults who channel their energies into their work to accelerate the healing process from early childhood traumas.  When the film begins Travers is introduced to Disney's creative team and she digs her heels in objecting to anything contradictory to her aesthetic of Mary Poppins.  The film flashes back and forth from these sessions to her childhood in Australia.  As work progresses on the projected film the protective defenses that Travers has erected begin to evaporate as she recalls her childhood calamities.  When Travers storms out of the Disney offices allegedly in a snit over artistic differences it is then that Disney surmises that Travers created Mary Poppins to protect her from life's cruelties.  ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is nothing short of brilliant casting similar magic that the ""Mary Poppins"" film cast in 1964.  The film is meticulous in unraveling the two decade long mystery as to why Travers denied Disney the film rights to Mary Poppins and why she was so protective of her creation.  I can't fathom why the picture or Thompson were not nominated for Oscars this year.  This film is certainly better than the sterile and overrated ""Gravity"".  ""Saving Mr. Banks"" has a resonance that's lacking in most films.  I was curious why this film was rated PG-13 considering that ""Mary Poppins"" was the ultimate general audience film.  There are thematic elements in the film that would probably be a little unsettling to younger audiences but nothing remotely offensive.  I've never read the Mary Poppins books but I'm a long time fan of the film.

Travers (Emma Thompson) went to Hollywood to negotiate with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) about negotiating the film rights to MARY POPPINS.  As she negotiates - often fruitlessly - with Disney's creative team, her mind flashes back to her childhood in Australia.  Through such flashbacks we learn the extent to which MARY POPPINS is based on her autobiographical experiences.  Thompson's performance is a memorable one; her reactions to Disney's idealized world are classic, especially when she repeats the words &#34;No! No! No!&#34; in tones that recall Margaret Rutherford.  She is also vulnerable in an alien world, which pushes her towards a friendship with her driver Ralph (Paul Giametti).  Hanks' Disney comes across as an avuncular personality with a penchant for getting what he wants, but not without a considerable degree of understanding.  The portrait is an idealized one (apparently Disney was much more ruthless, and did not really get on with Travers at all), but works well within the overall film.  There are sentimental moments, but the ending is particularly affecting, when the film juxtaposes clips from the 1964 version of MARY POPPINS with Travers' and Disney's reaction, as they watch the premiere in Hollywood.",4,"Sentimentalized Portrait, but Affecting Nonetheless",1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,1286,"['SAVING', 'MR.', 'BANKS', 'story', 'when', 'author', 'P.', 'L.', 'Travers', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'went', 'Hollywood', 'negotiate', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'negotiating', 'film', 'rights', 'MARY', 'POPPINS', 'often', 'fruitlessly', 'Disney', 'creative', 'team', 'mind', 'flashes', 'back', 'childhood', 'Australia', 'such', 'flashbacks', 'learn', 'extent', 'MARY', 'POPPINS', 'based', 'autobiographical', 'experiences', 'Thompson', 'performance', 'memorable', 'one', 'reactions', 'Disney', 'idealized', 'world', 'are', 'classic', 'especially', 'when', 'words', '34', 'No', 'No', '34', 'tones', 'recall', 'Margaret', 'Rutherford', 'also', 'vulnerable', 'alien', 'world', 'towards', 'friendship', 'driver', 'Ralph', 'Paul', 'Giametti', 'Hanks', 'Disney', 'across', 'avuncular', 'personality', 'penchant', 'getting', 'what', 'not', 'considerable', 'degree', 'understanding', 'portrait', 'idealized', 'one', 'apparently', 'Disney', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'ruthless', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'get', 'Travers', 'well', 'overall', 'film', 'are', 'sentimental', 'moments', 'ending', 'particularly', 'affecting', 'when', 'film', 'juxtaposes', 'clips', '1964', 'version', 'MARY', 'POPPINS', 'Travers', 'Disney', 'reaction', 'watch', 'premiere', 'Hollywood']",Saving Mr. Banks

Emma Thompson succeeds memorably as P.L. Travers, the complex, seemingly-joyless British authoritarian behind the source novel, while Tom Hanks is, surprisingly, only okay as Walt Disney himself. The tough, contested relationship between these two, opposite sides of the same coin, forms the core of the story; Disney pushes to make the film uplifting and creative, while Travers fights to maintain her characters' dignity. On the surface, it's a good example of how the powers of dedication and creativity can overcome difficult circumstances to make a brilliant piece of work - perhaps one that's even better than they'd have made amidst calmer waters. I felt that the scenes inside Disney's idea factory, superficial as they proved to be, were the film's best.

KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[3, 5]","I've been a fan of Walt Disney for many years and while I know he wasn't always ""Uncle Walt"" he was not the monster that some try to convey every chance they get. Walt Disney was a salesman, artist, storyteller, visionary.... the list goes on and I would like to think he was a pretty good guy. I say this because even though I've done my research, I didn't know him personally.(and nether did any of the people who seem to want only to tarnish his legacy!)The Disney company however is a completely different animal and I loathe what they have done to this man's company. This film which I found very entertaining may be or may not be true and unless you were there in the room you probably should just keep your mouth shut on the subject. I'm sure there were liberties taken with the facts of this situation, but that is Hollywood folks liberties are taken with a grain of salt.Okay, on to the film itself. I liked this movie, I found it to be true at its core, sure it probably didn't all happen the way we see it on screen, but we go to movies to be entertained. Tom Hanks gives a good portrayal of a man I think would be hard to portray. Walt Disney is so well known it is hard to get his image out of your mind. I thought the fact that they showed Walt hiding his smoking from the public and hearing him cough from time to time in this film was a nice little character embellishment and showing the writing on the wall for Walt's fate to come in just a few years after Poppins was released.  Thompson and Giamatti are also good here, but while I found this film enjoyable I would have rather have seen a film about Walt and Roy Disney and this particular situation just a piece of that film.Tha Disney brothers have a story that should be told and now that this film has seen some success, maybe someone will see what a great movie there is to be made, hopefully we'll see some of the not so whitewashed parts of their lives too because regardless of these things Walt Disney brought more happiness to the world than most anyone can claim, even if he was a shrewd businessman.The Blu Ray looks great, but there should have been more bonus material on this edition.",4,"THIS IS NOT A FACTUAL DOCUMENTARY, BUT A VERY GOOD MOVIE!",1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2014,2170,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'many', 'years', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'Uncle', 'Walt', 'was', 'not', 'monster', 'try', 'convey', 'chance', 'get', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'was', 'salesman', 'artist', 'storyteller', 'visionary', 'list', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'guy', 'say', 'because', 'even', ""'ve"", 'done', 'research', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'personally', 'nether', 'did', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'want', 'only', 'tarnish', 'legacy', 'Disney', 'company', 'however', 'completely', 'different', 'animal', 'loathe', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'man', 'company', 'film', 'found', 'very', 'entertaining', 'may', 'be', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'were', 'there', 'room', 'probably', 'should', 'just', 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut', 'subject', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'liberties', 'taken', 'facts', 'situation', 'Hollywood', 'folks', 'liberties', 'are', 'taken', 'grain', 'salt.Okay', 'film', 'liked', 'movie', 'found', 'be', 'true', 'core', 'sure', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'way', 'see', 'screen', 'go', 'movies', 'be', 'entertained', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'good', 'portrayal', 'man', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'portray', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'hard', 'get', 'image', 'mind', 'thought', 'fact', 'showed', 'Walt', 'hiding', 'smoking', 'public', 'hearing', 'time', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'nice', 'little', 'character', 'embellishment', 'showing', 'writing', 'wall', 'Walt', 'fate', 'come', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'Poppins', 'was', 'released', 'Thompson', 'Giamatti', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'here', 'found', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'Walt', 'Roy', 'Disney', 'particular', 'situation', 'just', 'piece', 'film.Tha', 'Disney', 'brothers', 'have', 'story', 'should', 'be', 'told', 'now', 'film', 'seen', 'success', 'maybe', 'someone', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'be', 'made', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'see', 'not', 'so', 'whitewashed', 'parts', 'lives', 'too', 'regardless', 'things', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'brought', 'more', 'happiness', 'world', 'most', 'anyone', 'can', 'claim', 'even', 'was', 'shrewd', 'businessman.The', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'great', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'bonus', 'material', 'edition']",Saving Mr. Banks

Thurlow,"[21, 24]","The creative clash of a powerful Hollywood producer and a best-selling author over the making of a movie would appear to be thin material for a holiday movie.  In the capable hands of the Walt Disney Company and a host of excellent actors, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is an unexpected pleasure, funny and emotionally engaging in a powerful way.The movie opens in 1961.  P.L. Travers, author of the ""Mary Poppins"" series of books, has been persuaded to fly to California to discuss the making of a movie with Walt Disney himself.  Travers (Emma Thompson) is very much invested in protecting her character from Hollywood exploitation, just about as much as Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) wants to make a movie out of the story.  Travers makes life very difficult for Disney's creative team and Walt himself.Paralleling Travers' adventures in America is the story of her upbringing, half a century earlier, in rural Australia, a slow-motion tragedy that is the deep backstory to her ""Mary Poppins"" characters.  Devotion to her memories of that childhood are a stumbling block to the creative process in the present.  Walt Disney will be driven to great lengths to meet her more than halfway, culminating in a fateful conversation over tea back in London and a promise to respect her memories, even if it means remaking them a little.The acting in this movie is special.  Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are terrific together.  Colin Ferrell is heartbreaking as Travers' father, the inspiration for Mr. Banks.  Paul Giamatti is superb as Travers' limo driver in California, the one person who doesn't have an agenda.  A dozen other actors, including Kathy Bates and Ruth Wilson, have well-rounded supporting roles. Annie Rose Buckley almost steals the movie as the solemn young Travers.This movie is a ""talky"", with no action to speak of.  The sets, whether 1961 or 1906, are convincing.  The humor is often subtle but quite good.  The dramatization carries real emotional impact.  The movie will make more sense if the viewer has seen the classic movie ""Mary Poppins"".

1632547,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00BEIYSL4,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[2, 4]","SAVING MR. BANKS (Prod. Disney/BBC/Australia Films, Dir. John Lee Hancock, 2013, 126 minutes) ~This is a film I had been dying to see, and have just seen it. It was deeply rewarding in ways I can't really express, but I can, however, offer you a review of this fine family Disney film. What's more, for me anyway, it is the first Disney film I know of with Walt Disney himself (Tom Hanks in an OSCAR-worthy turn) as one of the central characters. It occurs to me also that my mind is boggled when I think of how much I love Tom Hanks--he is probably my most reviewed star because he's been part of my life for so long.Emma Thompson plays ""Mrs. Travers"", the creator of Mary Poppins. As frightening as she is mean, the spooky old bat is being wooed by Disney for the film rights to ""Mary Poppins"" and the year is 1962. According to Disney's remark, he's been chasing her for 20 years to get those rights. When she comes out to L.A. she becomes even more frightening ... and will Old Uncle Walt win her over, do you think?In the course of the film, through flashbacks I thought were annoyingly lengthy, we discover just how much pain and misery is contained in the creation of ""Mary Poppins"" by Travers, whose real name as we all now know was Helen Goff. It is her story and her pain, I suppose, but man!--those flashbacks are half the film and they would have done better tightening those. Still, it can be seen how the flashbacks are really necessary and help move the 'present' Disney storyline.In addition to Hanks, the scenes of the Disney headquarters in 1962 were perfection. Emma Thompson is no less deserving of an Oscar here. She is at her strongest, but I worry since I've never, ever seen her looking so thin. Her skill is absolute top-notch and only Hanks makes her shrink a little onscreen. In fact, I knew Disney and he--like Hanks--made everything in his environment shrink with his dazzling presence. I will never miss a film with Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks ... or Paul Giamatti.Well, guess who plays Disney's chauffeur assigned to Mrs. Travers?! Plus he has a vital role to play in this drama. Now my moaning begins but it will be brief. It is all about Disney. Hanks has too little time onscreen, and he definitely does not resemble Disney at the time because the makeups are far too 'young'. Hanks can never be put down, but this by appearance is Disney from around 1950, not 1962-1964 which is the timeframe this film covers. He is onscreen far too little anyway, and I wonder why they did all that.This is the one and only time I can actually say: I knew Walt. I'm nowhere near his generation but he, like I, was Chicago-born and Midwest-raised. His Chicago birthplace is no more than 1/4 mile from mine. This film did him great justice, it was an honor to see it and Tom Hanks definitely made it seem as if Walt really is in the room with us. What I wonder is why the pronounced Southern accent?--Walt pared and perfected his speech so no accent could be detected. Hanks ought to have known that.Although I have groused here, the attention to detail in this film is something I can't ignore. The wardrobe and everything is spectacular, to say the least. While there are anachronisms in the dialogue, there is nothing else anachronistic here. From Walt's famous Claddagh ring (he wore this on his right hand after he and his wife bought matching rings in Claddagh in 1948) to Mrs. Travers' famous ""signet"" ring--her father's ring which she wore on her left middle finger. It's all here, and I loved those details.That's all the grousing I can do here. This film made me weep, because like Walt and Helen Goff, I had a similarly tough childhood. As Walt and I always said, the child within stays alive and is forever in there somewhere--but to give yourself a life sentence for 'the bad of the past' is no good. ""I'm so tired of remembering it THAT way,"" Disney says sadly to Travers, referring to his own blistering memories.So am I. While healing tears will flow from seeing this, it's that weariness the film made me relive a little bit. My hope is that the viewer won't feel worn down by this or by the insanely plastic, super-Technicolor world of Disney. After all, 'begun is half done' and we can always sing ""Supercalafragalisticexpialadotious"" to pull us through it.And may I add, though I am no big fan of Colin Farrell's, he does a tremendous and perhaps overlooked job as Travers Goff, ""Mrs. Travers'"" real father.NOT-SO-FUN FACT: Hanks and Thompson, weirdly, are two (of four) of the only actors to receive a Golden Globe, SAG, BAFTA and Critics' Choice nomination respectively for the same performances and then fail to be Oscar-nominated: Hanks forCaptain Phillips(see my review) and Thompson for this, in which she ironically stars with Hanks. If I'm not mistaken, it is the first time Hanks and Thompson have made a film together.FUN FACT: Hanks, a 3rd cousin four times removed of President Lincoln's, saw the 2013 Oscar go to Daniel Day Lewis for his performance inLincoln(see my review)--which is why he did not get the Golden Boy for CAPTAIN PHILLIPS. I do not know who won the Oscar that ought to have gone to Emma Thompson for BANKS.

We were not disappointed.Here's the scoop. Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) wants to film Mary Poppins but needs the book's author, P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), to sign off on the rights. She's desperately in need of the dough but has a severe disdain for the Disney machine and figures he'll ruin her work. He flies her to L.A. to try and change her mind. What a bumpy road it is.This is a truly wonderful movie. Hanks is good as Disney. He shows the patience of Job and consistently bends to the wishes of Travers but there seems to be no winning. They juxtapose this scenario with slices of her story as a young girl in Australia. It was a rough life. Her dad's (Colin Ferrel) head was in the clouds and it hurt the family. But his cloudy-headedness seems to be what drove her to be an author. Watching B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as Robert and Richard Sherman running through the song writing process was also a lot of fun. I always enjoy Paul Giamatti and though he doesn't have much of a role here he presents a very likable character who actually helps sway the stalemate.This is a very good production.

1632568,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEIYSL4,FNDNreview,"[1, 2]","Like most people, I honestly couldn&#8217;t tell you who created Mary Poppins and if you had asked me a month ago if I had ever heard of P.L. Travers, I would have been completely dumbfounded by the name. However, now that BBC Films has teamed with Walt Disney Pictures to produce the new biopic, Saving Mr. Banks, it&#8217;s relatively safe to say a whole new generation of moviegoers will know exactly who Mrs. Travers is and how she came up with one of the most iconic characters ever conceived.Directed by John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side), Saving Mr. Banks stars Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers, the English author of the popular children's book, Mary Poppins. On a yearly basis, Mrs. Travers is contacted by Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) in regards to making Mary Poppins into a film. However, she is reluctant to work with him and is desperately afraid he will turn her beloved character into another one of his happy-go-lucky cartoons. For years, Disney has hounded her to sign over her consent to create a Mary Poppins film, but she considers the character to be family &#8211; and as it turns out, the Mary Poppins story has more to do with Travers' own family than anyone knows.At the same time, the royalty checks have stopped coming in for the original Mary Poppins book, and since Mrs. Travers refuses to write another novel, it has put her in a financial pinch. Her lawyer indicates that it's in her best interest to go to California and work out her creative differences with Walt Disney in order to get the feature film off the ground. Once there, and with creative control on her side, she must work out her differences with the creative team, including Don DaGradi (Bradley Whitford), and the Sherman brothers, Robert (B.J. Novak) and Richard (Jason Schwartzman).While focusing on developing the script and songs for the Mary Poppins film, Saving Mr. Banks also tells a parallel story that intertwines with Mrs. Travers during her time with the creative staff. She focuses heavily on her early childhood while living with her family in Australia, especially the time she spent with her father, Travers Robert Goff (Colin Farrell). He was a loving father, attempting to support his family by working at a bank, just as Mr. Banks did in Mary Poppins. The difference is her father was not a wealthy aristocrat as portrayed in the story. Instead, he was a conflicted individual that was unable to control his anger or his ambition to consume alcohol.Clearly, Mrs. Travers was a difficult woman to deal with in nearly every aspect of life &#8211; which is well presented by the flawless performance of Academy Award winning Emma Thompson. If you've never seen or heard an interview with the late Mrs. Travers, then believe me when I say that Thompson's interpretation is far nicer than the presentation in this family-friendly film. This aspect makes Thompson's performance all that much more impressive, because it's hard to imagine very many people liking Mrs. Travers, yet at no point in this film is she vilified. In fact, with the constant flashbacks to her childhood, she becomes a largely sympathetic character that you can't help feel compassion for. It also doesn't hurt that Emma Thompson herself is an absolute marvel to witness, not just in this film but over the course of her momentous career.The film focuses heavily on Thompson's portrayal as the strict, borderline snobby (or proper, depending how you look at it) Mrs. Travers &#8211; but the supporting cast also deserves a massive amount of credit for their roles. In particular, Tom Hanks role as the determined, but not overly pushy Walt Disney is the most notable &#8211; and is quite nostalgic if you're able to remember back to those classic shots of Walt Disney during the 1960s and 70s. Oddly enough, it's the trademark mustache on Hanks that really brings out the slight resemblance to Mr. Disney &#8211; who has never been portrayed in modern media until now. On a side note, even though Mr. Disney was a heavy smoker back in the day, you won't be seeing Hanks holding a cigarette (except for one brief scene). Apparently, that's an unforgivable offense in a Disney film.Recognizable actors Paul Giamatti and Bradley Whitiford also contribute heavily to this film in their minor supporting roles. Obviously, it seems like Giamatti is everywhere these days, having roles in Turbo, Parkland, 12 Years a Slave, and All is Bright in 2013 alone. You're almost forced to wonder if the man ever sleeps. His co-star, Bradley Whitiford, is probably most recognizable from his starring role in NBC's The West Wing or as Adam Sandler's foe in Billy Madison. Whitiford does a fair share of singing and dancing in this film, portraying Don DaGradi who, along with Bill Walsh, wrote the screenplay for the Mary Poppins film.While this is one of the better biopics in the last few years, there are few elaborations that stick out in Saving Mr. Banks. For one, this film implies that Mrs. Travers had a massive amount of input throughout the duration of the pre-development of Mary Poppins. In reality, she was overruled by Disney on several aspect, including the inclusion of the animated portions &#8211; of which she demanded Disney remove after the initial premiere. After signing over her rights, she had very little to do with the final product. In fact, Mrs. Travers detested the Mary Poppins film so much that she refused to let Disney adapt any of her future Poppins stories (she would go on to create seven more successful Mary Poppins novels).Lastly, for a film that focuses so much on Mrs. Travers' family, it's a bit surprising to see that her son, Camillus, is never mentioned (although briefly alluded to). Her son was adopted, which is something she neglected to tell him until he found out on his own &#8211; leaving a dark cloud over several years in both of their lives. Of course, there is quite a bit of negativity surrounding this aspect of her life, so it might have been far too much to include in a Disney produced film that typically loves to send everyone home happy.Overall, Saving Mr. Banks is without a doubt the best biopic of 2013 and also a formidable contender for the best picture of the year (regardless of its future accolades). Both Emma Thomson and Tom Hanks are magnificent in their respective roles, radiating with magic and authenticity. Both of their portrayals are full of heart, history, and loyalty to their beloved characters. Although Mrs. Travers was clearly a forced to be reckoned with, her desire to protect her beloved Mary Poppins is quite an astonishing story. She may not have enjoyed the end result of the 1964 classic, which went on to propel Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke to new heights, but she did reap the reward of its $100 million box office earning (of which she received 5%). Regardless, Saving Mr. Banks is a feel-good film that should be witnessed by all.GRADE:  AFNDNreview.com",5,"'Saving Mr. Banks' illuminates the under appreciated icon, Mrs. P.L.

Travers as the adult child of an alcoholic &#8230; a brilliantly creative woman who hadn't recourse to therapy but used her fiction to process childhood issues, meanwhile resorting to outlandish control and intimidation tactics to cope with daily life.Remarkably for a Disney production, the film doesn&#8217;t flinch while addressing that childhood: Travers grew up with an alcohol-addicted father, and the movie shows him dying from cirrhosis of the liver &#8230; in contrast to the pussyfooting Wikipedia bio, which blames &#8220;influenza.&#8221;I hadn't expected anything like this and was startled by the toughness and integrity of the script, direction, and Thompson's performance as Travers. I also applaud the production for not whitewashing the Disney studios or Disney himself. Only the very ending seemed to entail artistic license: it introduced a note of hope that the 1964 &#8220;Mary Poppins&#8221; premiere moved Travers to experience some psychic growth.

Writing a book, making a movie, composing songs -- all of these come from scratch, but they all connect to life experiences and deep emotions, sometimes not even realized by the creative person.You're not doing your job as a creative if you don't come up with something you become attached to. But once you do that, you set yourself up for hurt and defensiveness. It's realizing that and dealing with this phenomenon that is the constant challenge in a creative endeavor.Few movies capture such an ethereal concept as well as Saving Mr. Banks. It's not about what room Walt Disney stood in on February 3, 1062, nor is it about who is opposing whom. And it's downright foolish and misguided to see it as one side &#34;winning&#34; over another. A creative thing is a living thing and it lives on in film, music, print and more. It's about the work, not who is who. That transcends the time, setting and players.The performances are spot on. Lots has been said about the actors, but I also loved the way it was filmed, the sequences that tied one era to another, and the superb musical score.Not much in the way of bonus features on the Blu-ray (would have loved a commentary), but the major documentary is very fresh and filled with insight not found anywhere else. The rousing film wrap moment when the crew sang &#34;Let's Go Fly a Kite&#34; is downright tear-jerking.

1632596,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B00BEIYSL4,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[0, 2]","SPOILERS FOLLOWThe Walt Disney Company's ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a perfectly fine film, detailing the making of Disney's(mostly)live-action classic ""Mary Poppins.""  Starring Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks, it is an old-fashioned feel-good live-action Disney movie for the modern age.Ms. Thompson is arresting as the salty P.L. Travers, whose battles with Walt Disney(an uncharacteristically hackneyed Tom Hanks), set the stage for a tired, formulaic plot.  The movie's true triumph is the detailed glimpses of Travers' childhood home in Australia, and touchingly creative fluorishes of ""Poppins"" music.  Specifically, the movie makes excellent use of ""Winds in the East,"" and ""Let's Go Fly A Kite.""Emma Thompson gives a spectacular performance as author P. L. Travers.  It's blatantly wrong that she was overlooked for a nomination as Best Actress.  Colin Farrell is similarly brilliant, giving arguably his best performance in years as Travers Goff, the author's loving, complicated father.  Tom Hanks is a nearly unfailingly luminous actor in almost every role he takes on.  His acting in last year's ""Captain Phillips"" ranks among the best of his storied career on the big screen.  Here, he is completely miscast as Walt Disney.  He never really seems natural playing the animator and entertainment mogul.  In the early scenes, his vocal inflections even remind me of his Santa Claus character in The Polar Express.  Tom Hanks is a huge personality.  Walt Disney was a huge personality, and the two could never mesh for me.  An unknown may have been able to fade into the Walt Disney role more completely.Despite my above complaints, I recommend this movie wholeheartedly.  It can be viewed as a prequel to ""Mary Poppins,"" and even provides its own insights and a welcome freshness for that great movie.",4,"""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a fine movie, yet Tom Hanks is oddly miscast.",1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,1801,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWThe', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Company', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'film', 'detailing', 'making', 'Disney', 'mostly', 'live-action', 'classic', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Starring', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'old-fashioned', 'feel-good', 'live-action', 'Disney', 'movie', 'modern', 'age.Ms', 'Thompson', 'arresting', 'salty', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'battles', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'uncharacteristically', 'hackneyed', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'set', 'stage', 'tired', 'formulaic', 'plot', 'movie', 'true', 'triumph', 'detailed', 'glimpses', 'Travers', 'childhood', 'home', 'Australia', 'touchingly', 'creative', 'fluorishes', 'Poppins', 'music', 'Specifically', 'movie', 'excellent', 'use', 'Winds', 'East', 'Let', 'Go', 'Fly', 'A', 'Kite', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'author', 'P.', 'L.', 'Travers', 'blatantly', 'wrong', 'was', 'overlooked', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'similarly', 'brilliant', 'giving', 'arguably', 'best', 'performance', 'years', 'Travers', 'Goff', 'author', 'loving', 'complicated', 'father', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'nearly', 'unfailingly', 'luminous', 'actor', 'almost', 'role', 'acting', 'last', 'year', 'Captain', 'Phillips', 'best', 'storied', 'career', 'big', 'screen', 'Here', 'completely', 'miscast', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'never', 'really', 'natural', 'playing', 'animator', 'entertainment', 'mogul', 'early', 'scenes', 'vocal', 'inflections', 'even', 'remind', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'character', 'Polar', 'Express', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'huge', 'personality', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'was', 'huge', 'personality', 'two', 'could', 'never', 'mesh', 'unknown', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'fade', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'role', 'more', 'completely.Despite', 'complaints', 'recommend', 'movie', 'wholeheartedly', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'prequel', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'even', 'own', 'insights', 'welcome', 'freshness', 'great', 'movie']",Saving Mr. Banks
1632597,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B00BEIYSL4,Gryphonisle,"[0, 0]","""Saving Mr. Banks"" turned out to be quite a bit better than whatever I expected from it, perhaps I was channeling memories of ""Miss Beatrice"", the occasional animation feature that purported to tell the story of Beatrix Potter.  From what I gather online, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is far closer to the Truth than mere entertainment.  Mrs. Travers was a piece of work, pretty much like her vain, unpleasant and often rude character, Mary Poppins.  In this effort, two stories unwind simultaneously;  one is the contemporary tale of Walt Disney and Co. trying to construct a movie from Mrs. Traver's book, the author having finally  succumbed to his blandishments for the usual reasons:  Money.  Her royalties were on the wane.  She hates everything, and having last say on the scripting, tries to protect her story.  Her recollections of her childhood, in Australia, create the other story, in flashback, which serves to fill in Traver's backstory, and to give the audience insight into the inspiration for Mary Poppins (Traver's aunt).Only Paul Giamatti's character is invented;  that and the Australian countryside, which is somewhere in California (and Heritage Square, off the Pasadena Freeway).  The movie actually makes Mrs. Travers seem a bit nicer than she apparently was in real life, in Hollywood or London.  ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is more of a light drama than anything else, yet suitably entertaining, given its subject matter.I only read the book this January, and having done so (it reads very much like Milne's ""Winnie The Pooh"") and grown up on the movie, I can say I'm not much of a fan of either.

1632611,A2YNT4QDEQX30F,B00BEIYSL4,H. Snyder,"[1, 1]","Walt Disney and author P.L. Travers both created alter egos that not only had traits of their creators, but became almost as emotionally important to them as an actual child. Disney created Mickey Mouse in the 1920s, and was the voice for Mickey in the earliest talking cartoons, beginning in 1928. Disney continued in this capacity through the late 1940s, providing the familiar falsetto voice of his most famous creation. Helen Goff, writing under the pen name of P. L. Travers, created the magical nanny Mary Poppins, a character closely identified with Goff's traumatic childhood in Australia.These two obsessive creative personalities, Disney and Travers, waged a quiet twenty-year battle over the film rights to Travers' Mary Poppins. Finally Disney prevailed after a personal visit by Travers to California, which is the principle storyline of this film. In 1964 the enormously successful film starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke was released to great acclaim. Saving Mr. Banks recounts this contest of wills, and features frequent flashbacks to Goff's childhood, with her memories of her beloved but chronically alcoholic banker father, and her distracted mother trying to raise three children in remote rural Australia. The Mary Poppins inspiration was Goff's maternal aunt, whose stern presence was summoned in an attempt to save ""Mr. Banks"", otherwise known as Travers Goff, father of ""P.L. Travers"".Saving Mr. Banks is an enjoyable and moving film experience, combining as it does a good story that has some elements familiar to almost everyone, and a superb cast led by Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as P. L. Travers. Notable among the many fine performances is that of Colin Farrell as the loving, talented, but self-destructive Travers Goff. Paul Giamatti, one of Hollywood's most versatile and believable actors, puts in an emotionally subtle performance as the chauffeur assigned to Mrs. Travers during her stay in Los Angeles.The agonies of the screenwriting crew in dealing with the notoriously difficult Travers are shown in some detail. If you watch to the end of the credits, you will hear a few minutes of an actual fifty-year-old recording of one of the brainstorming and bargaining sessions between Travers and Disney's story and music-writing personnel.",5,"Straight from Your Childhood, a Well-told Story of Two Famous Entertainers",1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2014,2297,"['Walt', 'Disney', 'author', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'created', 'alter', 'egos', 'not', 'only', 'had', 'traits', 'creators', 'became', 'almost', 'emotionally', 'important', 'actual', 'child', 'Disney', 'created', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', '1920s', 'was', 'voice', 'Mickey', 'earliest', 'talking', 'cartoons', 'beginning', '1928', 'Disney', 'continued', 'capacity', 'late', '1940s', 'providing', 'familiar', 'falsetto', 'voice', 'most', 'famous', 'creation', 'Helen', 'Goff', 'writing', 'pen', 'name', 'P.', 'L.', 'Travers', 'created', 'magical', 'nanny', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'character', 'closely', 'identified', 'Goff', 'traumatic', 'childhood', 'Australia.These', 'two', 'obsessive', 'creative', 'personalities', 'Disney', 'Travers', 'waged', 'quiet', 'twenty-year', 'battle', 'film', 'rights', 'Travers', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Finally', 'Disney', 'prevailed', 'personal', 'visit', 'Travers', 'California', 'principle', 'storyline', 'film', '1964', 'enormously', 'successful', 'film', 'starring', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'was', 'released', 'great', 'acclaim', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'contest', 'wills', 'features', 'frequent', 'flashbacks', 'Goff', 'childhood', 'memories', 'beloved', 'chronically', 'alcoholic', 'banker', 'father', 'distracted', 'mother', 'trying', 'raise', 'three', 'children', 'remote', 'rural', 'Australia', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'inspiration', 'was', 'Goff', 'maternal', 'aunt', 'stern', 'presence', 'was', 'summoned', 'attempt', 'save', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'otherwise', 'known', 'Travers', 'Goff', 'father', 'P.L', 'Travers', '.Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'enjoyable', 'moving', 'film', 'experience', 'combining', 'good', 'story', 'elements', 'familiar', 'almost', 'everyone', 'superb', 'cast', 'led', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'P.', 'L.', 'Travers', 'Notable', 'many', 'fine', 'performances', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'loving', 'talented', 'self-destructive', 'Travers', 'Goff', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'versatile', 'believable', 'actors', 'emotionally', 'subtle', 'performance', 'chauffeur', 'assigned', 'Mrs.', 'Travers', 'stay', 'Los', 'Angeles.The', 'agonies', 'screenwriting', 'crew', 'dealing', 'notoriously', 'difficult', 'Travers', 'are', 'shown', 'detail', 'watch', 'end', 'credits', 'will', 'hear', 'few', 'minutes', 'actual', 'fifty-year-old', 'recording', 'one', 'brainstorming', 'bargaining', 'sessions', 'Travers', 'Disney', 'story', 'music-writing', 'personnel']",Saving Mr. Banks

Tom Hanks and Emma Thomson are brilliant, and the rest of the slim cast handle their roles beautifully.It definitely is not a Disney movie made for children or even for family viewing, unless you are ready for a lengthy discussion of the issues it raises. For adults, it is a well written and well acted story tying three cultures together - rural Australia of the 30's, stiff and proper England of the 70's, and an optimistic and materialistic US of the 70's. Yet its magic is in the way it replaces the story we know so well - Disney's &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; - with the true story of writer P.L. Travers childhood. As she watches her creation, the Mary Poppins stories, being recast in frivolous ways, especially (gasp!) with animation, it raises more than the hairs on the back of her neck. But Travers too has recast the difficult truth in her own stories. In the end it is Disney's reminder that &#34;This is what we story tellers do. We restore order with imagination.

Travers, the feisty woman who wrote ""Mary Poppins."" (I never heard about that, did you? Evidently this battle was waged over a 20-year period, as their respective fortunes waxed and waned.)The doughty author is an unbending, sharp-tongued shrew who flings insults with arrogant abandon but expects to be treated with deference and respect. ""I am Mrs. Travers, NOT Pamela!"" She intimidates everyone she encounters, ignores contracts and marches out of meetings without compunction. The pears in her complimentary fruit basket at the Beverly Hills hotel are lobbed off the balcony. Her outrageous demands are legendary: ""There will be no RED in this film!""We follow:* Tom Hanks (""Cloud Atlas"") as Walt Disney, beset by a cantankerous dame who will not trust him to do justice to her beloved character. It takes his insight and shared memories of mutually unlovable fathers that allows him to finally make a tiny dent in her armor.* Emma Thompson (""Nanny McPhee"") is P.L. Travers who swears she will make sure her creation is treated with respect. To her, Disney is the personification of a Hollywood machine that will maul her magical nanny beyond recognition. (He first proposed an animated version.)* Annie Rose Buckley (""Home and Away"") is Ginty, the name her doting father called our author when she was a child in Australia. We see numerous flashbacks that illustrate her hardscrabble childhood.* Colin Farrell (""Dead Man Down"") is Travers Goff, her beloved banker father who colors her childhood with his affection and his drunkenness. Farrell continues to dazzle me with his range and skill! He even makes his drunken character lovable.* Ruth Wilson (""Luther"") is Margaret, our author's long-suffering mother, living at the lonely end of the railroad line in Australia.* Rachel Griffiths (""Brothers & Sisters"") is Aunt Ellie, umbrella and bottomless carpetbag in hand, come to that miserable house to help the struggling family. The moment we see her rigid silhouette at the front door, we KNOW who inspired Mary Poppins!* Paul Giamatti (""Romeo and Juliet"") is Ralph, the first American to face Travers' withering scorn; he is her limo driver. She isn't impressed by California; when she sniffs the air, he tells her she is smelling jasmine, she thinks it ""smells of sweat!""""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" is hidden from Mrs. Travers because she won't tolerate nonsense. Disney's talented but thoroughly cowed songwriters (played by Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak) are out-witted, out-foxed and out-maneuvered by this wily, determined, and exasperating woman.The screening audience often laughed at her acerbic (PG-13) wit.

If you haven't heard the buzz on this film, it concerns the back story of how Walt Disney took years (well, decades actually) to convince P.L. Travers, the author of the Mary Poppins books to let Disney have the rights to make the Mary Poppins film.Tom Hanks looks like he is having a wonderful time portraying the larger than life Walt Disney. Emma Thompson seems to be channeling every old crusty aunt she ever encountered as a child to bring the difficult and very odd authoress to the screen. Again, she appears to be having a ball.Colin Farrell plays the lovable but unreliable father of Mrs. Travers in the flashback scenes of her childhood in Australia. Apparently after her father died, young Helen Lyndon Goff reinvented herself as Pamela Lyndon Travers and traveled to England to write after a failed stage career in Australia. The Disney version of the story is quite whitewashed, although you might not think so while watching the film. Travers was apparently a bisexual single mother who adopted only one of a set of twins after consulting with an astrologer about which boy to choose.And if you think Emma Thompson is portraying Travers in a harsh light, stay behind in the theatre for the end of the credits, where they play some of the audio tapes of the meetings between the author and the film makers. She was a real piece of work!Thankfully, the Mary Poppins film that we know and love so well was made by Walt Disney as it is perfection in my estimation. Well, perhaps it is a tad too long, which is also the case with Saving Mr. Banks but they are equally wonderful. You will enjoy this film, especially if like me, you have a soft spot for Mary Poppins and the Banks family.",5,Mary Poppins certainly wasn't there to save the children!,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,1763,"['Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'lovely', 'film', 'jolly', 'holiday', 'might', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'buzz', 'film', 'back', 'story', 'how', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'took', 'years', 'well', 'decades', 'actually', 'convince', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'author', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'books', 'let', 'Disney', 'have', 'rights', 'make', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'film.Tom', 'Hanks', 'having', 'wonderful', 'time', 'portraying', 'larger', 'life', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'be', 'channeling', 'old', 'crusty', 'aunt', 'ever', 'encountered', 'child', 'bring', 'difficult', 'very', 'odd', 'authoress', 'screen', 'Again', 'be', 'having', 'ball.Colin', 'Farrell', 'lovable', 'unreliable', 'father', 'Mrs.', 'Travers', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'childhood', 'Australia', 'Apparently', 'father', 'died', 'young', 'Helen', 'Lyndon', 'Goff', 'reinvented', 'Pamela', 'Lyndon', 'Travers', 'traveled', 'England', 'write', 'failed', 'stage', 'career', 'Australia', 'Disney', 'version', 'story', 'quite', 'whitewashed', 'might', 'not', 'think', 'so', 'watching', 'film', 'Travers', 'was', 'apparently', 'bisexual', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'adopted', 'only', 'one', 'set', 'twins', 'consulting', 'astrologer', 'boy', 'choose.And', 'think', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'portraying', 'Travers', 'harsh', 'light', 'stay', 'theatre', 'end', 'credits', 'where', 'play', 'audio', 'tapes', 'meetings', 'author', 'film', 'makers', 'was', 'real', 'piece', 'work', 'Thankfully', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'film', 'know', 'love', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'made', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'perfection', 'estimation', 'Well', 'perhaps', 'tad', 'too', 'long', 'also', 'case', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'are', 'equally', 'wonderful', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'especially', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Banks', 'family']",Saving Mr. Banks

1632654,A2BAAKZHSUGCDP,B00BEIYSL4,"Jill Clardy ""So many books, so little time....""","[3, 4]","I knew little about the film other than the fact that it starred Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks and revolved around the making of the Disney movie &#34;Mary Poppins&#34;; however the star power of those two great actors was enough to convince me to give it a try. P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) is a stern middle aged British matron who has refused for 20 years to sign over the movie rights to Disney Studios; but when she is in financial need and in danger of losing her home, finally relents to at least visit Hollywood and see what Disney has in mind for her beloved book.Travers abhors everything about the Disney empire, and gets off to a bad start when she finds her room at the Beverly Hills Hotel stuffed with Disney toys and characters. Her driver during her stay is Paul Giamatti, and the relationship that she develops with him, starting with rudeness and ending up with fondness, is entertaining to watch. When she arrives at the studio to meet Walt Disney she makes it very clear that if they do not adhere to her restrictions for the screenplay, she will not sign the contract. She is a stern taskmaster with the entire staff, and the Sherman Brothers, who have been hired to write the songs for the movie, work hard to please her.Though I found her a bit tiresome at times, apparently the portrayal of Ms. Travers was accurate, as the proceedings were recorded on audio tape at her insistence. (Snippets from those tapes were played during the credits.) Mary Poppins is a part of Ms. Travers' family and upbringing, and she can't bear to see her story altered or trivialized in any way. Through flashbacks of Ms. Travers' childhood with her beloved father (acted beautifully by Colin Farrell), we come to understand why the fictional character is so important to her. The narrative is seamlessly woven between the current day and Ms. Travers' childhood, and builds up to an emotional climax.Tom Hanks plays Walt Disney as a fatherly and caring, though somewhat manipulative, businessman. Of course, we all know that he eventually got his way; but the way he finally won her over was lovely and inspiring to watch. &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; is interesting from a historical perspective, humorous and emotional with excellent casting decisions throughout.",5,Entertaining and Instructive,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,2265,"['knew', 'little', 'film', 'other', 'fact', 'starred', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'revolved', 'making', 'Disney', 'movie', '34', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '34', 'however', 'star', 'power', 'two', 'great', 'actors', 'was', 'enough', 'convince', 'give', 'try', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'stern', 'middle', 'aged', 'British', 'matron', 'who', 'refused', '20', 'years', 'sign', 'movie', 'rights', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'when', 'financial', 'need', 'danger', 'losing', 'home', 'finally', 'least', 'visit', 'Hollywood', 'see', 'what', 'Disney', 'mind', 'beloved', 'book.Travers', 'abhors', 'everything', 'Disney', 'empire', 'off', 'bad', 'start', 'when', 'room', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Hotel', 'stuffed', 'Disney', 'toys', 'characters', 'driver', 'stay', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'relationship', 'starting', 'rudeness', 'ending', 'up', 'fondness', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'When', 'studio', 'meet', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'very', 'clear', 'do', 'not', 'adhere', 'restrictions', 'screenplay', 'will', 'not', 'sign', 'contract', 'stern', 'taskmaster', 'entire', 'staff', 'Sherman', 'Brothers', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'hired', 'write', 'songs', 'movie', 'work', 'hard', 'please', 'her.Though', 'found', 'bit', 'tiresome', 'times', 'apparently', 'portrayal', 'Ms.', 'Travers', 'was', 'accurate', 'proceedings', 'were', 'recorded', 'audio', 'tape', 'insistence', 'Snippets', 'tapes', 'were', 'played', 'credits', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'part', 'Ms.', 'Travers', 'family', 'upbringing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'see', 'story', 'altered', 'trivialized', 'way', 'flashbacks', 'Ms.', 'Travers', 'childhood', 'beloved', 'father', 'acted', 'beautifully', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'come', 'understand', 'why', 'fictional', 'character', 'so', 'important', 'narrative', 'seamlessly', 'woven', 'current', 'day', 'Ms.', 'Travers', 'childhood', 'up', 'emotional', 'climax.Tom', 'Hanks', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'fatherly', 'caring', 'somewhat', 'manipulative', 'businessman', 'course', 'know', 'eventually', 'got', 'way', 'way', 'finally', 'won', 'over', 'was', 'lovely', 'inspiring', 'watch', '34', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', 'interesting', 'historical', 'perspective', 'humorous', 'emotional', 'excellent', 'casting', 'decisions']",Saving Mr. Banks

As an author, it's a dream for me to have someone put my story on screen, at the same time I dread something like Memoirs of A Geisha or some other terrible adaptation. I empathize with holding onto the integrity of the story. Honestly, as a late 70's early 80's kid, there were several other books on my obsessive reading radar. Disney's Mary Poppins was my first and only Poppins exposure, so I may be biased. I still love the film even though my kids are grown and almost launched.Emma Thompson captured Travers's tightly wound, hyper critical side too perfectly because I almost didn't finish the film. If Travers's childhood was portrayed truthfully, her personality is understandable. Many have tried to soften her portrayal, but when a family member says, &#34;She died without loving anyone and no one loved her.&#34; Well, it's no wonder the character caused me such friction.

The subject is fascinating- the making of one of the most beloved movies of all time. The ending is suitably sentimental without tipping over into mawkish.The only reason I don't believe it's a great movie is a question of balance. Certainly P.L. Travers was a difficult person to deal with (and we have her own voice over the credits at the end to testify to that). However, this script portrays her as unbelievably tiresome in her anti-American stance on, well, just about everything.

I'm British by background and I found myself saying &#34;Not again&#34; as she raised one trivial issue after another in the rudest possible fashion.

1632695,A3F8T3BRXRX5P3,B00BEIYSL4,JWink,"[1, 1]","Saving Mr. Banks is story of author P.L. Travers meeting with Walt Disney, who seeks to adapt her Mary Poppins books for the big screen.As a kid, I never was one who appreciated the story and music of Mary Poppins movie and didn't read any of the books either.  I only vaguely remembered the story within the movie (i.e. Van Dyke dancing and the penguins and things like that.)So I wasn't really sure how much I was going to enjoy a movie whose story was the behind the scenes story of a movie that I really didn't care much for.But the one thing I can say is that regardless of whether you liked the Mary Poppins movie or books, you will enjoy this movie as the story is very well done with a lot of heart and soul.The story does an incredible job at portraying the childhood story through the author's eyes as a child providing a very intimate portrait of her life.  There are moments you will laugh and moments you will cry and in the end the movie will leave you with an appreciation for the lady who wrote the books and for the books themselves.Tom Hanks' as Disney does an admirable job at portraying the man as he was with all the wit and charm that the real Disney was described as being.  And even as well as Hanks did in the role, I thought Emma Thompson as Travers was the stand out for her portrayal of author as Oscar worthy.  There are moments you dislike her, moments you find her charming and moments she makes you cry and brings it all full circle so that you understand what she was all about.  Outstanding job.Colin Farrell also  gives a great performance as Goff (Travers father).  Showing that even with his flaws he still manages to have the charm that endears him into his young daughters heart.And although I am sure this is not written to be totally accurate in the portrayal of the real life story (rarely these types of movies are),  but this story is done very well with a sentiment that makes you care about the characters and makes you feel and reflect.  At least it did for me and for those like me with fathers that did live up to their imaginations or wishes.Overall  a great movie and worth watching 4.5 stars.",4,Excellent 4.5 stars,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,2144,"['Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'story', 'author', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'meeting', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'who', 'adapt', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'books', 'big', 'screen.As', 'kid', 'never', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'appreciated', 'story', 'music', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'only', 'vaguely', 'remembered', 'story', 'movie', 'i.e', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'dancing', 'penguins', 'things', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'going', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'story', 'was', 'scenes', 'story', 'movie', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'one', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'regardless', 'liked', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'movie', 'books', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'lot', 'heart', 'soul.The', 'story', 'incredible', 'job', 'portraying', 'childhood', 'story', 'author', 'eyes', 'child', 'providing', 'very', 'intimate', 'portrait', 'life', 'are', 'moments', 'will', 'laugh', 'moments', 'will', 'cry', 'end', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'appreciation', 'lady', 'who', 'wrote', 'books', 'books', 'Hanks', 'Disney', 'admirable', 'job', 'portraying', 'man', 'was', 'wit', 'charm', 'real', 'Disney', 'was', 'described', 'being', 'even', 'as', 'well', 'Hanks', 'did', 'role', 'thought', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Travers', 'was', 'stand', 'out', 'portrayal', 'author', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'are', 'moments', 'dislike', 'moments', 'find', 'charming', 'moments', 'cry', 'full', 'circle', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'Outstanding', 'job.Colin', 'Farrell', 'also', 'great', 'performance', 'Goff', 'Travers', 'father', 'Showing', 'even', 'flaws', 'still', 'have', 'charm', 'young', 'daughters', 'heart.And', 'am', 'sure', 'not', 'written', 'be', 'totally', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'rarely', 'types', 'movies', 'are', 'story', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'sentiment', 'care', 'characters', 'feel', 'reflect', 'least', 'did', 'fathers', 'did', 'live', 'up', 'imaginations', 'wishes.Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', '4.5', 'stars']",Saving Mr. Banks

Happily, the depiction of the early 1960's opts for accuracy, not caricature.  Tom Hanks underplays Walt in this movie and his screen time is too short.  However, what we do get to see is a joy.Emma Thompson surely deserved an Academy Award for her role as Mrs. Travers.  All the other characters on the screen become her foils.  At first viewing, the story seems simple, but beneath the surface is a great deal of subtlety and irony.  Much is conveyed non-verbally, both in the flashbacks and 60's scenes.The screenwriters use their best devices to justify, humanize, and sympathize Mrs. Travers.  But viewers who live on a day to day basis with a man or woman with an attitude like P.L. Travers in the next cubicle may squirm in their seats.How does one respond to the triumphs and tragedies of one's own life?

They finally found commonality in their individual childhood experiences. Though they didn't achieve a friendship, they did learn to respect each other. Travers came to understand how Disney overcame his childhood troubles by reaching above negative thoughts and finding comfort in the love of all things good. Disney came to understand that Travers' personal connection with her book helped her come to terms with the profound losses she suffered in childhood. She believed that to give up the book was to give up her ability to cope. But, as each realized how the other had overcome great odds, they began to compromise without making each other give up what each valued.

1632752,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B00BEIYSL4,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[10, 12]","John Lee Hancock (The Blindside, The Rookie) directed this wonderful film that gives a much curious insight into what became one of Walt Disney&#8217;s most popular and beloved movies ever, &#8220;Mary Poppins&#8221;. With a wonderful script by Kelly Marcel (Fifty Shades of Grey, Terra Nova) and Sue Smith (Peaches, The Cooks), &#8220;Saving Mr. Banks&#8221; is a film about a film that almost didn&#8217;t get made.It&#8217;s hard to believe the author herself P.L. Travers, wanted nothing to do with Hollywood, the entertainment industry overall and especially Walt Disney who ironically enough did not give her blessing, begrudgingly, for over 20 years. Headlining the Travers herself is the tour-de-force performance of Emma Thompson (Nanny McPhee, Primary Colors) as the old-fashioned, somewhat bitter author who really was a real thorn in Walt&#8217;s side as well as the Sherman Brothers as they tried and tried composed the music for the original film much to her dismay.Tom Hanks (Big, Splash) gives an equally amazing performance as the man everyone knows, but knows very little about in terms of his personal style and personality traits. Turns out that Tom is amazing at getting across Disney&#8217;s convictions, warmth, true heart and the simplicity of fulfilling a promise to his daughters of making a movie called &#8220;Mary Poppins&#8221; based on Travers books. Again, he shines in his persona and makes it very easy to believe the man who warms the hearts of millions can even have problems sometimes warming the heart of just one person.Tom and Emma have such a great on-screen chemistry together and the constant infusion of P.L.&#8217;s ideas and concepts while tearing apart the project overall were a great contrast to Disney ever trying so hard to get to know her and figure her out and why she is so bitter. The movie has a really slow pace for the first 45 minutes or so, but then picks up as Emma shines as the feistiest and irritable English woman you will ever see on screen.The Sherman Brothers, the men who created the music for much of the award-winning Disney library are the ones who had the most difficult time working with P.L. as she was more than mean, cross and downright rude and the roles were poignantly cast by B.J. Novak (The Internship, The Office) as Robert Sherman and Jason Swartzman (Bored To Death, Scott Pilgram Vs. The World) as Richard Sherman. They have some amazing scenes with Emma that will definitely make you raise an eyebrow and feel for the brothers anguish.Another surprise in the film is Paul Giamatti (Sideways, Turbo) who gives a wonderful performance as the driver assigned to take P.L. wherever she needs to go in Los Angeles while Disney tries to swoon her for the rights to do her book on film. Paul is subtle and sensitive and amazingly heartwarming in his performance and you&#8217;ll actually cheer for him by the end.This movie is written in a visual style that intertwines P.L. Travers real life from her past intermixed with the current time of Disney and Travers trying to make a deal for her book. We get to see her as a young girl and her most important influence in her life, her father, who is wonderfully played by Collin Farrell (Phone Booth, Total Recall). At first it was a little strange, but as you see how everything ties together, cutting back and forth - it eventually makes much more sense.Thomas Newman ( Wall*E, Skyfall) adds his wonderful score to a really powerfully performed movie. This film will definitely warm your heart by the end. And, even with its Hollywood sprinkles of glamour throughout, &#8220;Saving Mr. Banks&#8221; portrays very real people and real feelings. It&#8217;s amazing what Disney had to go through to get &#8220;Mary Poppins&#8221; made. I give kudos to every performance in this film and a good insight to the creation of a legend.

Power ""nlp trainer""","[5, 8]","If you want to be an Oscar contender release your movie in December.I wonder do they have secret meetings in Hollywood about what types of movies to make if one wants to win an Academy Award, because we have seen a plethora of movies about movies and movie making in recent years, which seem to do quite well during award season.  The most successful one being The Artist which won numerous Academy Awards, and several other note worthies too.  I liked My Week with Marilyn which gained two well deserved Oscar nominations for Michelle Williams  and Kenneth Branagh.  I was less wowed with Hitchcock.Now with Saving Mr Banks we have the latest, and one of the greatest of them all,  and in terms of beautiful and emotional story as good a movie as you will see this year.For most authors having their book made into a movie would be a dream come true.Emma Thompson gives an outstanding performance as P.L Travers the author of Mary Poppins who is reluctant to say the least about having her story made into a movie, let alone a musical, and the battles with the creative team at Disney to get it made.If you're like me Travers is a pill, with the apparent social skills of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We see her first by how she interacts with ordinary people such as a flight attendant or a fellow passenger, and she seems entirely oblivious to how other people feel.  On some level we are horrified but yet it is in some ways amusing.Yet she is the driving force of the narrative with even Walt Disney played by Tom Hanks taking a back seat.  It's absolutely brilliant to see the creative forces at work in creating this classic, and as the parallel story of her childhood unfolds as you watch the movie, we gradually come to understand how she became who she is.She lobs pears from her courtesy fruit basket into the hotel swimming pool, and she does not seem to like people.  How did someone who wrote such a classic and inspiring children's book become like this you may wonder?Do our childhoods shape who we are?  Unless we learn how to let go, and in some cases re-imagine our childhoods as Disney says those childhood events may very well determine our destiny.Colin Farrell plays her father as a child, at once inspiring her imagination and love, yet also falling short, and the elements of Mary Poppins and her personal story start to mesh together wonderfully.Ultimately there is some catharsis.  Walt Disney had a tough childhood and became ultra successful.  Travers wrote a classic book stemming from her personal story and fashioned a classic.  She believed in sharing the darkness.  Many fairy tale stories are quite dark, often depicting the wickedness in human nature, knowing about wicked people and monsters is somehow better and more instructive than not knowing.Within the movie are some emotionally affecting scenes, and I know I was not alone in sniffling.  Not many movies have that kind of effect, so I loved that.At the end of the movie we may not come to love her, but if you can spare one liquid tear, you may come to like her.I think most people will love it, and I hope this was helpful.",5,The legendary struggle behind a classic story,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",2013,3121,"['want', 'be', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'release', 'movie', 'December.I', 'wonder', 'do', 'have', 'secret', 'meetings', 'Hollywood', 'what', 'types', 'movies', 'make', 'one', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'have', 'seen', 'plethora', 'movies', 'movies', 'movie', 'making', 'recent', 'years', 'seem', 'do', 'quite', 'well', 'award', 'season', 'most', 'successful', 'one', 'being', 'Artist', 'won', 'numerous', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'several', 'other', 'note', 'worthies', 'too', 'liked', 'My', 'Week', 'Marilyn', 'gained', 'two', 'well', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Michelle', 'Williams', 'Kenneth', 'Branagh', 'was', 'less', 'wowed', 'Hitchcock.Now', 'Saving', 'Mr', 'Banks', 'have', 'latest', 'one', 'greatest', 'terms', 'beautiful', 'emotional', 'story', 'good', 'movie', 'will', 'see', 'year.For', 'most', 'authors', 'having', 'book', 'made', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'dream', 'come', 'true.Emma', 'Thompson', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'author', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'who', 'reluctant', 'say', 'least', 'having', 'story', 'made', 'movie', 'let', 'alone', 'musical', 'battles', 'creative', 'team', 'Disney', 'get', 'made.If', ""'re"", 'Travers', 'pill', 'apparent', 'social', 'skills', 'Wicked', 'Witch', 'West', 'see', 'first', 'how', 'ordinary', 'people', 'such', 'flight', 'attendant', 'fellow', 'passenger', 'entirely', 'oblivious', 'how', 'other', 'people', 'feel', 'level', 'are', 'horrified', 'yet', 'ways', 'driving', 'force', 'narrative', 'even', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'played', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'taking', 'back', 'seat', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'see', 'creative', 'forces', 'work', 'creating', 'classic', 'parallel', 'story', 'childhood', 'unfolds', 'watch', 'movie', 'gradually', 'come', 'understand', 'how', 'became', 'who', 'is.She', 'lobs', 'pears', 'courtesy', 'fruit', 'basket', 'hotel', 'swimming', 'pool', 'not', 'seem', 'people', 'How', 'did', 'someone', 'who', 'wrote', 'classic', 'inspiring', 'children', 'book', 'become', 'may', 'wonder', 'Do', 'childhoods', 'shape', 'who', 'are', 'learn', 'how', 'let', 'go', 'cases', 're-imagine', 'childhoods', 'Disney', 'childhood', 'events', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'determine', 'destiny.Colin', 'Farrell', 'father', 'child', 'once', 'inspiring', 'imagination', 'love', 'yet', 'also', 'falling', 'short', 'elements', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'personal', 'story', 'start', 'mesh', 'together', 'wonderfully.Ultimately', 'catharsis', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'had', 'tough', 'childhood', 'became', 'ultra', 'successful', 'Travers', 'wrote', 'classic', 'book', 'stemming', 'personal', 'story', 'fashioned', 'classic', 'believed', 'sharing', 'darkness', 'Many', 'fairy', 'tale', 'stories', 'are', 'quite', 'dark', 'often', 'depicting', 'wickedness', 'human', 'nature', 'knowing', 'wicked', 'people', 'monsters', 'somehow', 'better', 'more', 'instructive', 'not', 'knowing.Within', 'movie', 'are', 'emotionally', 'affecting', 'scenes', 'know', 'was', 'not', 'alone', 'sniffling', 'Not', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'kind', 'effect', 'loved', 'that.At', 'end', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'come', 'love', 'can', 'spare', 'one', 'liquid', 'tear', 'may', 'come', 'like', 'her.I', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'hope', 'was', 'helpful']",Saving Mr. Banks

I cannot in good conscience think of a single flaw in it. John Lee Hancock's direction is simply flawless. Every sequence is brilliantly shot and well-staged and he bring out the best in every single actor--even Ginty the secretary was good. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking not only in its scope but in the rich, warm shades of earthy colors: brown, tan, gold, green, gray and sepia. The screenplay is terrific. There is not a single false note, not a drop of corniness, not one wasted line; everything is brief, concise and to the point with all dialogues relative to the conflict (Walt Disney trying to get Pamela Travers' approval) and the inspiration for the book. (Pamela's childhood)I will never understand why Emma Thompson was not nominated for Best Leading Actress of 2013. She pulls off Pamela's eccentrities and shrill, annoying, cantankerous antics effortlessly and even though I knew beforehand she was eventually going to soften into a more kind, gentle woman it develops so slowly and gradually that it feel real. My favorite of her scenes is when the Sherman Brothers are playing ""Let's go fly a kite."" At first she taps her feet to the rhythm. Then she smiles and sways a little. Then BOOM! The secretary dashes into Walt Dinsey's office exclaiming. ""YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THIS!!! You're not going believe it! She's SINGING and DANCING with them!!!"" And that look on her face as she tries to hold back her tears at the premiere was absolutely unforgettable.Tom Hanks completely melts into the charming, charismatic persona of Walt Disney. His best scene is where he goes to visit Pamela towards the end. He drops the Mr. Smiley act and comes down to earth when he tells her about his abusive childhood to assure her, she's not the only person who's been dealt hard cards.Colin Farrell and Ruth Wilson are outstanding in portraying the agony and suffering of Pamela's parents in the flashbacks--especially Wilson. I kid you not, I had never read the plot summary of the movie but when Wilson went into Pamela' room and said ""I know you gave him the whiskey. I'm not mad at you. Take care of your sisters."" From the resonance in her low, husky voice on the ""Take care of your sisters."" I simply KNEW she was going to end it all, or at least try to.My favorite scenes are:1. Pamela rescuing her mother in the lake.2. Pamela hugging Mickey Mouse in bed, a foreshadowment of how she's slowly learning to drop her `chip on a shoulder' mannerisms.3. One of the Sherman brothers drawing a picture of her yelling ""No! No! No!""4. Walt Disney giving her a ride on the carousel. The look on her face as she's riding side saddle is PRICELESS.I highly recommend this movie.

He buckles up &#8211; it&#8217;s going to be a bumpy ride. Mrs. Travers then throws pears out of her hotel window, growls at the writers in the Disney studios, whinges about piddly details like numbers on doors and moustaches and says &#34;No! No! No!&#34; absolutely all of the time. She&#8217;s even truculent in the face of the legendary Walt Disney and his considerable charm.&#8220;Saving Mr. Banks&#8221; uses the technique of running Ginty&#8217;s 1906 childhood in Australia alongside her 1961 Californian battle with Disney and his people &#8211; so we slowly get to see why the dreamy hopeful child grows into a woman who would pen such a prig and proper character. Key to all of this is her relationship with the man she worshipped &#8211; Travers &#8211; her father. His daily battle with drink made his wife attempt suicide in a lake - lost him his job and health (consumption) &#8211; and eventually saw the kids farmed out to a visiting matriarch - Aunt Ellie. And with her starched almost churchlike garments, large carpetbag, face-shaped umbrella and &#8217;no nonsense&#8217; practicality in the face of a crisis &#8211; Aunt Ellie would of course become the character &#8220;Mary Poppins&#8221;. But is Mary Poppins about her saving the children - or is it really about Ginty saving her father through fiction?The superb cast includes Ruth Wilson as Margaret Travers, BJ Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the composing brothers Robert and Richard Sherman and Bradley Whitford as Disney man Don DaGradi. But the movie belongs to the leads&#8230; Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson.There&#8217;s a strong body of evidence (&#8220;Castaway&#8221;, &#8220;Charlie Wilson&#8217;s War&#8221;, &#8220;Cloud Atlas&#8221; and &#8220;Captain Phillips&#8221;) that Tom Hanks may indeed be up there with De Niro, Al Pacino, Liam Neeson, Paul Giamatti, Philip Seymour Hoffman and other greats in terms of being the best actor who&#8217;s ever lived. So it takes serious boots to outshine him as Walt Disney. Up steps such a force of nature - Engerland&#8217;s Emma Thompson &#8211; giving her hateful bully lady a beating heart and gradually unfolding the real reasons for her guarded and prickly nature. Thompson gives a performance of true brilliance - an embattled woman who is hurting so deeply that you literally ache for her &#8211; cherishing dreams she cannot have sullied by commerce and gaudiness. The dances between her and Hanks are fabulous &#8211; but even better is her work with Giamatti &#8211; the humble limousine driver who touches her heart and makes her offer up a rare morsel of kindness when he reveals he has a special needs daughter (&#8220;tell your daughter she can do anything she puts her mind too&#8230;&#8221;).Credit also has to go Colin Farrell who is magnificent and measured as the troubled yet adoring father Travers. The scenes between him and Annie Rose Buckley as young Ginty are beautiful and immensely moving. Childlike and wondrous himself &#8211; he instils in his little girl the qualities that would make her such a great writer later on. But he also crippled her mind with images of innocence betrayed &#8211; and a helpless descent into loss that would haunt her for the rest of her life.Thomas Newman&#8217;s perfectly complimentary music and the presence of those wonderfully uplifting movie songs that are lingering in the back of our consciousness give the whole film warmth that&#8217;s tangible. But what really gets you over and over again - is the astonishing and truly immersive attention to period detail. The look of the bank Travers works in Allora, the huge wooden house on a hill in the middle of nowhere, the fun-fair day where he makes a fool of himself in front of his family because he&#8217;s drunk&#8230;  Then there&#8217;s the Beverly Hills Hotel where Pamela stays in 1961 &#8211; the Disney gift hampers she encounters in her room &#8211; even the stationery that Giamatti is holding when he meets her at the airport &#8211; all of it is period and absolutely spot on. There&#8217;s a scene where Walt takes Travers to Disneyland in an effort to soften her up &#8211; the stalls outside the theme park gates &#8211; the public crowds walking by the attractions and the carousel that ends up in the movie &#8211; huge set pieces - and all of it perfect.The BLU RAY print is glorious throughout - a big Hollywood production and the picture quality reflects that. It&#8217;s defaulted to 2.34:1 so there are bars top and bottom &#8211; but even extended to Full Aspect &#8211; the print is gorgeous. This film is real looker on the format. Audio is English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio with English 2.0 - Subtitles are English for The Hard Of Hearing, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Finnish - and the Extras include &#8220;Deleted Scenes&#8221;, &#34;The Walt Disney Studios: From Poppins To The Present&#8221; and &#8220;Let&#8217;s Go Fly A Kite&#8221;.And on it goes to P. L. Travers finally sat in a cinema with tears rolling down her face as Walt Disney gives her Mister Banks the joy he so lacked all those years ago in Australia. Even Dick Van Dyke&#8217;s awful accent is forgiven as the joy of the songs and the film transcends everything.&#34;Wind's in the east&#8230;mist coming in&#8230;like something is brewing&#8230;about to begin&#8230;&#34;&#8220;Saving Mr. Banks&#8221; is beautifully crafted cinema &#8211; superbly written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith and Directed by John Lee Hancock.Do yourself a favour and open

1632776,A1C9N96N2M5D13,B00BEIYSL4,"marriedutopianstriver ""Seeker Of Heaven On Earth""","[1, 2]","Saving Mr. Banks is a film that carefully centers around Walt Disney&#8217;s initial challenge in convincing the author of Mary Poppins (Pamela Travers) to hand over the concept of what Mary Poppins stands for. The movie includes scenes that flash back to how her viewpoints were shaped during her childhood years in Australia and the relationship with her parents. Each of the actors and actresses  contributed to the shaping of the movie&#8217;s depiction that captured Walt Disney&#8217;s interactions with Pamela Travers (Both Colin Farrell and Paul Giamatti are also featured in Saving Mr. Banks). However, I admit that I enjoyed watching Emma Thompsons gifted portrayal of a woman who initially seems snobbish when it comes to her interactions with both Disney and the other cast members. However, Emma Thompson carefully puts forth great intensity (through her emotions) in helping the viewing audience understand the root reasons behind her distant nature.  I also enjoyed Tom Hanks favorable impression of Disney because he used his acting skills to portray a man who tactfully found a way to help the author understand why she had reservations in sharing the book. It was also heartfelt that Hanks played a character who cared very much about keeping a past promise to his children.  Both Walt Disney and the workers initially get the cold treatment by Pamela Travers. Obviously, I must refrain from sharing more to keep in mind other film goers who have yet to see Saving Mr. Banks.",5,Parental Influence,1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,1493,"['Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'film', 'carefully', 'Walt', 'Disney', '8217', 'initial', 'challenge', 'convincing', 'author', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Pamela', 'Travers', 'hand', 'concept', 'what', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'movie', 'scenes', 'flash', 'back', 'how', 'viewpoints', 'were', 'shaped', 'childhood', 'years', 'Australia', 'relationship', 'parents', 'actors', 'actresses', 'contributed', 'shaping', 'movie', '8217', 'depiction', 'captured', 'Walt', 'Disney', '8217', 's', 'interactions', 'Pamela', 'Travers', 'Both', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'are', 'also', 'featured', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'However', 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Emma', 'Thompsons', 'gifted', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'who', 'initially', 'snobbish', 'when', 'interactions', 'Disney', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'However', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'carefully', 'forth', 'great', 'intensity', 'emotions', 'helping', 'viewing', 'audience', 'understand', 'root', 'reasons', 'distant', 'nature', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'favorable', 'impression', 'Disney', 'used', 'acting', 'skills', 'portray', 'man', 'who', 'tactfully', 'found', 'way', 'help', 'author', 'understand', 'why', 'had', 'reservations', 'sharing', 'book', 'was', 'also', 'Hanks', 'played', 'character', 'who', 'cared', 'very', 'much', 'keeping', 'past', 'promise', 'children', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'workers', 'initially', 'get', 'cold', 'treatment', 'Pamela', 'Travers', 'Obviously', 'must', 'refrain', 'sharing', 'more', 'keep', 'mind', 'other', 'film', 'goers', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks']",Saving Mr. Banks

It's nice that I'm able to say that ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is right up the same alley.We follow ice queen P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), writer of the original ""Mary Poppins"" stories. When her accountant informs her that she is on the verge of bankruptcy, she decides to finally consider, after twenty years of non-starter conversations, to sell the rights from her stories to Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) to make the now classic ""Mary Poppins"" film. Through flashbacks, we are informed of her childhood, the father who she loved, despite his constantly disappointing her. We also get a glimpse of what gave her the inspiration for the classic character she wrote, and why she holds her character so dear.Thompson gives a bravura performance here, in a character that nobody else could've played as well. Her character is hard to like, but impossible not to love by the end. She and Hanks have excellent chemistry, as their characters are polar opposites of one another.Travers is a miserable woman who is overly critical, rude and generally unpleasant. We don't like her at the beginning, but her character becomes very rich, and by the end, we understand her and can't help but adore her. Tom Hanks plays Walt Disney in a way that reminded me of SAG president Ken Howard's character of Hank Hooper on the show ""30 Rock"". He's a man of enormous power and wealth who's just a big `ol softie at heart. He's the perfect yin to Thompson's yang, and you'll only wish they would have had more scenes together.""Saving Mr. Banks"" is a backstage drama and a character study, and both of these work gloriously together in the film. Boasted by lovely supporting characters, and a narrative that never lulls along for too long, ""Mr. Banks"" feels like a breath of fresh air and a blast from the past all at the same time.

This conflicts with the fact that I don't find Tom Hanks a particularly good actor normally and Emma Thompson can be hit or miss and yet I still gave it a high rating.  The truth is, because Tom Hanks can be pompous and overbearing which apparently bleeds into his acting roles (or perhaps his acting bleeds into his real personality), he was perfect for the womanizing Walt Disney which he gave a surprising amount of charm.  Emma Thompson played a curmudgeon fairly well, although I suspect any weakness in the movie stemmed from a certain typical stiffness with which she played the character (something that she did even with Nanny McPhee, a movie I enjoyed).

1632802,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00BEIYSL4,M. Oleson,"[0, 2]","Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.Just in time for the 50th Anniversary Blu ray edition of ""Mary Poppins,"" the Disney folks coincidentally (sure) release this film.  Rather than dig deep into the background of making the film itself, director John Lee Hancock and his writers (Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith) delve into the brusk relationship between the crusty author of the ""Poppins"" books, P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) and Walt Disney (Tom Hanks).The film spends an equal amount of time in the present (early 1960's) and 1910 Australia where Travers grew up as Ginty (Annie Rose Buckley), the oldest daughter of banker Travers Goff (an unheralded Colin Farrell).  As the film flits between the time periods we learn why Mrs. Travers insists the film have a serious tone and certainly ""no animation!""  Goff and Ginty had a great relationship but he was also a card carrying alcoholic who had been fired from his job in the city and could only find work in a remote town on the continent.In the film ""Mary Poppins,"" Mr. Banks is the grouchy father who is a bank officer in London.  Thompson is brilliant as Pam, as Walt insisted on calling her.  She makes her character terribly unlikable, but a perfect challenge for Disney who was used to getting his way.  Mrs. Travers was reluctant to give up the film rights unless she had control over the story line.  The ever insistent Walt had made a promise to his daughters that he would make a film based on the books and pursued Mrs. Travers for 20 years.The best scenes are in the final act as Travers begins to soften, yet still refuses and returns to England.  Walt pursues her, showing up at her door unannounced.  As he always does Hanks manages to capture the whole movie in a 5 minute scene as he finally persuades Mrs. Travers to sign the contract.  This isn't a perfect film to be sure.  It runs a bit long and omits any interaction between Mrs. Travers and the actors who would play her characters.

1632806,A192Z1UVDNK88E,B00BEIYSL4,Mom of Sons,"[0, 0]","Watched Saving Mr. Banks this weekend. It was my husband's Netflix pick. I was not interested, at all. After seeing the trailers (for a year), and based on its Christmas opening, I was expecting a sappy boring saccharine contrived G -rated family friendly (i.e. talk down to the kiddies) Disney-esque comedy about the making of Mary Poppins.This seems to be one of those cases where studio marketers try to convince the general public that a movie is something it isn't (usually they try to make movies look funny) in order to sell tickets. Because, when we watched it, I was very surprised to find out that Saving Mr. Banks is quite sad.The author of Mary Poppins, Pamela Travers, was half mad with unresolved guilt and grief over her intensely painful childhood and her deep love for her hopelessly alcoholic father. She wrote her Mary Poppins books out of this deep grief and anguish. The movie is about her conflicts with the wonderful Disney team as they together (hammer and tongs) created the light and happy movie we all have loved for 50 years.Saving Mr Banks is primarily the story of a wounded and damaged little girl who becomes a wildly successful writer..yet she exists almost completely alone in the world. It is set against the fascinating backdrop of Walt Disney and the Disney company. ""Saving Mr Banks"" is not at ALL like ""Mary Poppins,"" although it is an homage to Mary Poppins' creators.The actors are terrific, every single one. Colin Farrell as Travers' father was a standout, wonderful, as was Tom Hanks serving as the cornerstone of the movie as the beloved, iconic Walt Disney.Did I like it? Yes i think i did. It was better than i expected. It was also sadder though. My favorite parts were those having to do with the nostalgic, respectful and wonderful portrayal of Walt Disney, his genius, his character. My least favorite parts, unfortunately, featured the very prickly PL Travers (Emma Thompson was wonderful in her portrayal), which is, obviously the largest part of the movie. Doesn't help that I read the trivia on IMDB afterward and learned that Travers resented Disney until the day she died, and that when Poppins became a Broadway show, she said yes to that project only if Disney wasn't involved and also barred the Shermans, who wrote the beloved music and lyrics to the movie. Biting the hand that feeds you (hands that were so kind to her! and so profitable for her, making it possible for her to stay in the home she loved!) is a very unappealing trait.Recommendation: Yes, but expect it to be a memoir of a complex, cranky, hard-to-like woman, with the side benefit of a wonderful, beautiful, fascinating look at Disney history. Don't expect a picture about wonderful Disney history, with a side story of a cranky, hard-to-like woman.",4,Not What I Expected -- And I Mean That in a Good Way,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,2779,"['Watched', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'weekend', 'was', 'husband', 'Netflix', 'pick', 'was', 'not', 'interested', 'seeing', 'trailers', 'year', 'based', 'Christmas', 'opening', 'was', 'expecting', 'sappy', 'boring', 'saccharine', 'contrived', 'G', '-rated', 'family', 'friendly', 'i.e', 'talk', 'kiddies', 'Disney-esque', 'comedy', 'making', 'Mary', 'Poppins.This', 'be', 'one', 'cases', 'where', 'studio', 'marketers', 'try', 'convince', 'general', 'public', 'movie', 'something', ""n't"", 'usually', 'try', 'make', 'movies', 'look', 'funny', 'order', 'sell', 'tickets', 'when', 'watched', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'quite', 'sad.The', 'author', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Pamela', 'Travers', 'was', 'half', 'mad', 'unresolved', 'guilt', 'grief', 'intensely', 'painful', 'childhood', 'deep', 'love', 'hopelessly', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'wrote', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'books', 'deep', 'grief', 'anguish', 'movie', 'conflicts', 'wonderful', 'Disney', 'team', 'together', 'hammer', 'tongs', 'created', 'light', 'happy', 'movie', 'have', 'loved', '50', 'years.Saving', 'Mr', 'Banks', 'primarily', 'story', 'wounded', 'damaged', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'wildly', 'successful', 'writer..yet', 'almost', 'completely', 'alone', 'world', 'set', 'fascinating', 'backdrop', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Disney', 'company', 'Saving', 'Mr', 'Banks', 'not', 'ALL', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'homage', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'creators.The', 'actors', 'are', 'terrific', 'single', 'one', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Travers', 'father', 'was', 'standout', 'wonderful', 'was', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'serving', 'cornerstone', 'movie', 'beloved', 'iconic', 'Walt', 'Disney.Did', 'Yes', 'i', 'think', 'i', 'did', 'was', 'better', 'i', 'expected', 'was', 'also', 'sadder', 'favorite', 'parts', 'were', 'having', 'do', 'nostalgic', 'respectful', 'wonderful', 'portrayal', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'genius', 'character', 'least', 'favorite', 'parts', 'unfortunately', 'featured', 'very', 'prickly', 'PL', 'Travers', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'was', 'wonderful', 'portrayal', 'obviously', 'largest', 'part', 'movie', ""n't"", 'help', 'read', 'trivia', 'IMDB', 'afterward', 'learned', 'Travers', 'resented', 'Disney', 'day', 'died', 'when', 'Poppins', 'became', 'Broadway', 'show', 'said', 'yes', 'project', 'only', 'Disney', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'also', 'barred', 'Shermans', 'who', 'wrote', 'beloved', 'music', 'lyrics', 'movie', 'Biting', 'hand', 'hands', 'were', 'so', 'kind', 'so', 'profitable', 'making', 'possible', 'stay', 'home', 'loved', 'very', 'unappealing', 'trait.Recommendation', 'Yes', 'expect', 'be', 'memoir', 'complex', 'cranky', 'hard-to-like', 'woman', 'side', 'benefit', 'wonderful', 'beautiful', 'fascinating', 'look', 'Disney', 'history', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'picture', 'wonderful', 'Disney', 'history', 'side', 'story', 'cranky', 'hard-to-like', 'woman']",Saving Mr. Banks
1632807,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B00BEIYSL4,Monty Moonlight,"[4, 4]","Okay, I won't say it should have made a clean sweep at the recent Academy Awards, I haven't seen the other films that were nominated yet, but at the very least, this film deserved nominations across the board. &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; is an amazing film. Practically perfect in every way. Yeah, I'm sure that has gotten used a lot in reviews about it. Sorry.The film, based on actual events, tells the story of a reluctant visit by &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; author P.L. Travers to the U.S., more specifically, to the Walt Disney Studios, to give Walt Disney one last chance to convince her to sign over the movie rights to the beloved children's book. This is going to be no easy job though. This is a woman dead set against her precious characters being reinterpreted by anyone else, least of all Walt Disney! She's a serious, proper woman with no fondness for pixie dust, singing, or (most especially) cartoons! The story moves back and forth between the &#34;present&#34;, in this case being the early 1960's, and Travers' memories of her own childhood in Australia in the early 1900's. The film gives equal attention and importance to both periods, and it interacts together beautifully, playing the tragedy of Travers' childhood against the magical optimism of Walt Disney's fantasy infused world.Everything about this film, visually, is beautiful. The acting, it is simply top notch. We're talking about Tom Hanks as Walt Disney and Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers. Thompson is masterful at making a very unpleasant woman equally sympathetic and heartbreaking, but certainly, that is helped by the wonderful performances in the flashbacks. I admit, I have never been a Colin Farrell fan. I don't like the &#34;bad boy&#34; image (and how much it fascinates women...), but I have to give him props for his performances as a kind, loving father who had ended up in a career completely contrary to his personality, and who turned to alcoholism in a hopeless attempt to deal with it. The adorable Annie Rose Buckley plays young P.L. Travers, and she is a treasure in this film. Now, I was very concerned, I admit, about the role of Walt Disney. Hanks certainly has the spirit, but could he pull it off? Seeing the first photos of him in the role had me worried! But that was completely unnecessary. Once he is perfectly introduced in the film, I complete accept him as Uncle Walt. Tom is simply amazing in the role! We also get Bradley Whitford as script writer Don DaGradi, and B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as Robert and Richard Sherman respectively, the legendary brothers behind so many of our favorite Disney songs. These performances are all priceless, and there are more as well, but the highlight for me was really Paul Giamatti as P.L.'s Disney driver during her Los Angeles stay, Ralph. Though his role is not quite as large as the others, it is just as important to making the film work, and Paul never fails to bring me to tears with his sincerity.The single Oscar nomination this film landed was for the score, and it's well deserved. There is much Mary Poppins music incorporated into it and throughout the film. The scenes in the 1960's at the Disney Studio spend a large amount of time in a rehearsal room near Walt's office. It's in this room where the Sherman Brothers, DaGradi, and Polly (Michelle Arthur), I forget what her position was, but another fine performance, perform songs for Mrs. Travers and attempt to negotiate dialogue, designs, and everything else going into bring the world of Mary Poppins to the silver screen. It's some truly great stuff, sometimes quite hilarious, and sometimes seemingly hopeless. Now, keep in mind that we don't see the movie being filmed, nor the actors or anything else. This is early in production on &#34;Mary Poppins&#34;. After all, Walt doesn't even have the rights to make the film yet. This brings up an important issue though. Have you seen Mary Poppins?!!! If you haven't, whether you see &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; or not, you really need to see &#34;Mary Poppins&#34;. And, no, the stage version is not a suitable substitute. In fact, I really disliked it when I saw it a couple years ago, aside from the Step in Time bit. But, honestly, I wonder and I really don't know how someone could fully appreciate &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; if they haven't seen &#34;Mary Poppins&#34;, the classic Disney film. I really don't recommend it. As some have suggested, yes, definitely buy (or rent) both of them, and watch Mary Poppins BEFORE Banks. I also recommend watching it after, but you NEED to have seen it beforehand, I think. Oh, I suppose you can still enjoy Banks, but really, it's going to be far, far less than if you know what they're talking about (and arguing about). Let's just say, &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; is truly one of the greatest films ever. I mean EVER. Of course, if you're a hardcore Disney fan, &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; is probably one of your &#34;greatest films ever&#34; too, and there's no reason it shouldn't be. I'm not certain I would put it on that list myself, but it definitely is a true fave, and I'm sure it deserves to be counted among the best films of last year.As for the Blu-Ray release of &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34;, well, it leaves a lot to be desired in the department of supplements, and that's too bad. The combo pack does NOT include a DVD. Odd for a Disney release. Instead, you get the digital copy. At least those don't require separate discs anymore (or hard drive space), but I liked having the DVD even more. More importantly though, there are only 3 bonus features on the disc. They are great, but they are only three. First, there are a few deleted scenes. Let me say, all these scenes are great. I almost wish they had all been left in. There is this great scene with Giamatti standing up to Walt, to a slight degree, that is just awesome. I understand leaving that one out to keep Walt in a good light (not that it is bad, but it shows him pressuring P.L. perhaps more than the company would like, but kudos on including it in the bonus features anyway), but still, it's as powerful as it is subtle. The second bonus feature is an excellent one. It's basically your behind the scenes of the film, though it's largely about the Disney Studios at the time of when it was set. The film's director, John Lee Hancock, takes us on a tour of the Disney Studios and spends time with the real Richard Sherman in the very places all these events happened. It's some very touching stuff. The final bonus feature is a quick, musical moment from the last day of shooting. A sort of cast party singing along as the real Richard Sherman plays &#34;Let's Go Fly a Kite&#34; on the piano. Another very touching bit of footage. Yeah, the bonus features are all excellent, but again, just three. I tell ya, a commentary track with the real Richard Sherman sitting in would be awesome! Even if it was just for certain scenes.Overall, if you are a Disney fanatic, you definitely need this film in your collection. if you love the movie &#34;Mary Poppins&#34;, you definitely need this film in your collection, but even if you just love this cast and great acting, and old Hollywood, there is so much to love about this film! I love the way they captured the time periods, by the way! I'm not a huge fan of some aspects of the 1960's, but Disney 60's is a whole other thing (I suppose it falls in line with the Mad Men style, but with more stuffed animals and fun), and this film captures it beautifully! Even the Disney Park costumed characters and plush toys are perfectly dated! With the exception of Chip and Dale, ha. Did they add that shot in later? At least once, I saw some very 21st Century Chip 'n' Dale costumes, ha, but that was like a couple of seconds of something only a Disney nut like me would notice, ha. Otherwise, yep, &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; is practically perfect in every way!",5,Only one Oscar nomination?

It was interesting to see ""Saving Mr. Banks"" to get behind-the-movie insight into the making of Mary Poppins.

I loved all the Disney stuff. Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks and supporting actors and actresses were great. At first, I didn't know if I could stand Emma's character, P.L.

And she does a wonderful job at it.The movie is entertaining, engaging, and rather emotional.  Disney the studio has taken liberties with the truth (not surprising for any Hollywood studio), particularly where Disney himself was concerned.  But the movie does what was intended - which is to let the viewers know that Disney the man faced huge obstacles bringing the movie to the screen.  All because the author was a bit, well, nuts.One good effect will be that most viewers will be motivated to turn to the internet, and find that she was actually worse than the movie represented.  The author had a background as an actress before she was a writer, and some very shady aspects to her nature, as well as very shellfish ones.  According to her grandchildren, she died &#34;alone, loving no one, and loved by no one.&#34;So it isn't surprising to find Disney bent the truth about the ending.  Disney claims Travers crashed the Premier, then loved the film, with the two parting friends.  In reality, Travers crashed the Premier as noted, but was incensed by the movie, and left with a snub from Walt.

Stevens,"[0, 0]",I am a huge Disney fan and I wanted to see this movie because it's a &#34;history lesson&#34; of how the movie adaptation of Mary Poppins came to be. This movie follows two storylines. One storyline is the &#34;present day&#34; of the film set in 1961 and the other storyline is set in 1906. We find out quickly that these two storylines match up with each other and most importantly throughout the movie we find out exactly how the story of Mary Poppins came to be. There were very sad and uncomfortable parts towards the end of the movie but they needed to be shown in order to explain the title of the movie.Although I felt Tom Hanks provided the right &#34;look&#34; of Walt Disney I did feel at times it was hard to believe he was Walt Disney himself given that Tom Hanks has a very recognizable talk and laugh. Emma Thompson gave a great performance but I did feel she was a bit young to be playing the part of a 62 year old. I did enjoy that they incorporated Tom Hanks heavily coughing several times throughout the movie because Disney died several years later after this story from lung cancer. They don't actually show him smoking but there's one scene he makes a reference to that. It's a morbid tidbit but I was actually somewhat happy to see that little Disney trivia included within the movie.I recommend this to any Disney history fan. This movie can be emotional at times so I don't recommend it to the younger children. There's a scene where they go to the Disneyland theme park so if you like the theme park you might find this movie interesting for that.

1632838,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00BEIYSL4,Paul Allaer,"[5, 7]","&#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; (2013 release; 120 min.) brings the real-life story of how Walt Disney tried to convince PL Travers, the author of the Mary Poppins books, to let Disney Studio adopt it into a family-oriented, feel-good musical. As the movie opens, we are in Maryborough, Queensland (Aus) in 1906, where we get to know young Helen (nicknamed Ginty), her troubled (and alcoholic) dad Travers, and the rest of her family. The movie then morphs to London, 1961, where we get to know PL Travers as a difficult and outright grumpy woman, but because she is literally out of money, her agent is able to convince her to go to Los Angeles and meet with Walt and the rest of the Disney team, to see if they can come to terms on the development of the movie. From there the movie cuts back and forth between Australia and the 1960s. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, even though this movie already has a great buzz around it, I was more than pleasantly surprised, and moved. The writers (Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith) did an outstanding job recreating the circumstances of Helen Goff (who later changed her name to PJ Travers). In the first hour of the movie, when we don't really know PJ Travers yet, we wonder why, when her agent implores her to go to Los Angeles, PJ Travers bitterly replies &#34;you don't know how much she means to me!&#34; (she being the Mary Poppins creation). Only much later do we get a true sense of it. Second, tip o' the hat to Emma Thompson, who blew me away frankly, and to Tom Hanks, in their roles as PJ Travers and Walt Disney, respectively. Only recently did I see Hanks in &#34;Captain Phillips&#34;, and this movie now makes two in a row where Hanks brings a winning performance. Looks like he's got his mojo back after a weak string in recent years. Third, kudos to the production team. I couldn't stop marveling at the sets in this movie, which were picture perfect in every detail. Fourth, just to warn you that you may need some Kleenex towards the end of the movie (I know I did). Last but certainly not least, there is an excellent orchestral score to the movie, composed by Thomas Newman (the soundtrack can be found here on Amazon).&#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; opened yesterday here in Cincinnati, and the late matinee screening I saw this at today was very well attended, I am happy to say. The audience was really into it, laughing loudly at all the right moments. Bottom line: &#34;Savings Mr. Banks is another top-notch look at a slice of Hollywood from yesterday, not unlike, for example, the &#34;Hitchcock&#34; movie from last year starring Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren. &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,"""You don't know what she means to me!""",1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,2789,"['34', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', '2013', 'release', '120', 'min', 'real-life', 'story', 'how', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'tried', 'convince', 'PL', 'Travers', 'author', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'books', 'let', 'Disney', 'Studio', 'adopt', 'family-oriented', 'feel-good', 'musical', 'movie', 'are', 'Maryborough', 'Queensland', 'Aus', '1906', 'where', 'get', 'know', 'young', 'Helen', 'nicknamed', 'Ginty', 'troubled', 'alcoholic', 'dad', 'Travers', 'rest', 'family', 'movie', 'then', 'London', '1961', 'where', 'get', 'know', 'PL', 'Travers', 'difficult', 'outright', 'grumpy', 'woman', 'literally', 'money', 'agent', 'able', 'convince', 'go', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'meet', 'Walt', 'rest', 'Disney', 'team', 'see', 'can', 'come', 'terms', 'development', 'movie', 'movie', 'back', 'forth', 'Australia', '1960s', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Couple', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'even', 'movie', 'already', 'great', 'buzz', 'was', 'more', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'moved', 'writers', 'Kelly', 'Marcel', 'Sue', 'Smith', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'recreating', 'circumstances', 'Helen', 'Goff', 'who', 'later', 'changed', 'name', 'PJ', 'Travers', 'first', 'hour', 'movie', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'PJ', 'Travers', 'yet', 'wonder', 'why', 'when', 'agent', 'go', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'PJ', 'Travers', 'bitterly', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', '34', 'being', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'creation', 'Only', 'much', 'later', 'do', 'get', 'true', 'sense', 'Second', 'tip', 'o', 'hat', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'who', 'blew', 'away', 'frankly', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'roles', 'PJ', 'Travers', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'respectively', 'Only', 'recently', 'did', 'see', 'Hanks', '34', 'Captain', 'Phillips', '34', 'movie', 'now', 'two', 'row', 'where', 'Hanks', 'winning', 'performance', 'got', 'mojo', 'back', 'weak', 'string', 'recent', 'years', 'Third', 'kudos', 'production', 'team', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'marveling', 'sets', 'movie', 'were', 'picture', 'perfect', 'detail', 'Fourth', 'just', 'warn', 'may', 'need', 'Kleenex', 'end', 'movie', 'know', 'did', 'Last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'excellent', 'orchestral', 'score', 'movie', 'composed', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'soundtrack', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Amazon', '34', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', 'opened', 'yesterday', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'late', 'matinee', 'screening', 'saw', 'today', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'attended', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'audience', 'was', 'really', 'laughing', 'loudly', 'right', 'moments', 'Bottom', 'line', '34', 'Savings', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'top-notch', 'look', 'slice', 'Hollywood', 'yesterday', 'not', 'example', '34', 'Hitchcock', '34', 'movie', 'last', 'year', 'starring', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Helen', 'Mirren', '34', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '34', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",Saving Mr. Banks

This &#34;Hollywood' bio of the legendary final battle between Disney and Travers for the 'soul' of Mary Poppins has style, acerbic wit, winning characters and a sense of place that is all too rare these days.

So, first to the movie aspect of the review:All of the actors in this movie did a superb job transporting the audience into a real tear jerker of a story.  There is no way around the fact that this story tells a very compelling human drama and then deals with how we adjust our emotional stability and preservation of memories by trying to recast things in a better light.From an informational standpoint, this movie does an excellent job of showing some of the challenges that converting a book into a movie can entail and how the challenges of life can be transported into an uplifting fictional version of life.For all of the above, I would definitely rate this movie a 5 star.  So, why is it only a 4 star?  Frankly, it is because it changes one's perspective about a treasured movie and shows us how different reality and story telling can be.

DelParto ""Rose2""","[0, 0]","Saving Mr. Banks is a heartwarming movie that most likely may have an affect on any avid fan of the Walt Disney genre of films that have had a memorable movie soundtrack.  One can say that is the rough cut and behind the story film based upon the composing and writing of the soundtrack of the Mary Poppins film inspired by author P.L. Travers' (Emma Thompson) story of the beloved nanny.  Tom Hanks plays the legendary Walt Disney and Jason Schwartzman and B.J. Novak play the Sherman brothers and Bradley Whitford the conductor and songwriters that romp through the songs and Paul Giamatti the Disney assistant and valet to Travers.  But the most thought provoking part about the film is the biographical elements of the story of Mary Poppins that parallel with Travers' life and her family.The film is told in flashbacks from 1908 to around 1961 to Beverly Hills to the outback of Travers' childhood and the gut-wrenching moments centering upon her father played by Colin Farell.  Viewers may presume by the end of the film that the inspiration of Mary Poppins originated from Travers's life and Mr. Banks, a tinge of her father's tease that she remembered when he would shave.  Aside from the ironic moments of the film, there are the humorous and tongue in cheek ones of playfulness and sentimental journeys through the songs of Mary Poppins, ""A Spoon full of Sugar,""  recreations of the innocent time period with the nostalgic costumes and props dating back to the early 1960s, especially a trip that Travers was forced to take to Disneyland five years after its opening.  Since this was Tom Hanks' production he adds the authenticity to a tee from Disney's suit to his office.Saving Mr. Banks can be described with many enchanting descriptions because of how it associates with the most revered and creative geniuses in popular culture.  Like a Disney film but with a back story, or more so two stories and films in one, do not be surprise if the concluding scenes will tug at the heart strings or have one grabbing for a tissue.",5,"""Let's make something wonderful""",1396137600,"03 30, 2014",2014,2036,"['Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'heartwarming', 'movie', 'most', 'likely', 'may', 'have', 'affect', 'avid', 'fan', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'genre', 'films', 'have', 'had', 'memorable', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'One', 'can', 'say', 'rough', 'cut', 'story', 'film', 'based', 'composing', 'writing', 'soundtrack', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'film', 'inspired', 'author', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'story', 'beloved', 'nanny', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'legendary', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'B.J', 'Novak', 'play', 'Sherman', 'brothers', 'Bradley', 'Whitford', 'conductor', 'songwriters', 'romp', 'songs', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Disney', 'assistant', 'valet', 'Travers', 'most', 'thought', 'provoking', 'part', 'film', 'biographical', 'elements', 'story', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'parallel', 'Travers', 'life', 'family.The', 'film', 'told', 'flashbacks', '1908', '1961', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'outback', 'Travers', 'childhood', 'gut-wrenching', 'moments', 'centering', 'father', 'played', 'Colin', 'Farell', 'Viewers', 'may', 'presume', 'end', 'film', 'inspiration', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'originated', 'Travers', 'life', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'tinge', 'father', 'tease', 'remembered', 'when', 'would', 'shave', 'Aside', 'ironic', 'moments', 'film', 'are', 'humorous', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'ones', 'playfulness', 'sentimental', 'journeys', 'songs', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Spoon', 'full', 'Sugar', 'recreations', 'innocent', 'time', 'period', 'nostalgic', 'costumes', 'props', 'dating', 'back', 'early', '1960s', 'especially', 'trip', 'Travers', 'was', 'forced', 'take', 'Disneyland', 'five', 'years', 'opening', 'was', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'production', 'authenticity', 'tee', 'Disney', 'suit', 'office.Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'many', 'enchanting', 'descriptions', 'how', 'most', 'revered', 'creative', 'geniuses', 'popular', 'culture', 'Disney', 'film', 'back', 'story', 'more', 'so', 'two', 'stories', 'films', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'surprise', 'concluding', 'scenes', 'will', 'tug', 'heart', 'strings', 'have', 'one', 'grabbing', 'tissue']",Saving Mr. Banks

A fine screenplay that brings out the character of Walt Disney's Midwestern charm, wisdom and business acumen.  (He was, after all the creator of a magic kingdom.)  And Ms. Thompson's character, a curmudgeonly British spinster, Pamela Travers, who happened to have created one of the most famous children's books of all time, was played flawlessly. Although the movie, &#34;Mary Poppins,&#34; was a hit, and Disney and Travers are portrayed as burying the hatchet in this dramatization, in actuality Ms. Travers refused to allow Disney to make any further movies about her character.  Pamela Travers was in fact a very enigmatic woman and her portrayal in this screenplay is limited in scope.  It is an entertaining movie but could have been so much more if Pamela Travers had received a broader treatment in the screenplay.  Or perhaps we need another movie about the real Pamela Travers.

In one thread (1961) we have the curmudgeonly author behaving like a stark raving... well, curmudgeon as she tries to exert control over the creative process.  In the other thread (1906, Australia) we unwind the story of her grim childhood that makes her a curmudgeon in the first place.This movie has a lot of things to say not the least of which is to cast an entirely different light that beloved American classic of childhood.  Mary Poppins ain't quite what you think it's about as a kid (but then what good movie IS what you think it's about when you're a kid).  It's also a powerful demonstration of how our childhood influences us as adults sometimes in ways that we don't quite grasp until we look back on them from a great distance.It's also interesting to see behind the curtain of the creative process.  Avoiding spoilers, the author's primary objection is that Mary Poppins and the Banks family have become, in truth, her family over the years and sharing that vision and letting someone else have a piece of them is frightfully difficult.  It does make a person wonder if all authors have this same struggle when crossing mediums.Lastly, I'm a sucker for sentiment but this movie had the audience blowing its nose and audibly sniffing for a good hour.  It's an incredibly intimate portrait.  However, the kids won't think much of it and the group in the theatre with me was 50+ for the most part.  All that said, highly recommended for anyone with a sentimental streak.  Best movie I've seen in a month or more.Oh, and the patient who sit through the credits will be treated to some photos from the movie's production and a section of the recorded conversations between the author and the production cast.PS: It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews.

Hanks, Giamatti and Whitford--all of whom are capable of brilliance--are about as subtle as a toilet seat. The actors aren't at fault. It's the script and the direction.

Even movies that get great reviews can be pretty dull.But I am so glad to let you know that this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time--in fact, it's the only movie I've paid to see twice in two consecutive weeks.For those who don't know it (and I didn't until this movie came out), getting the author of &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; to sell the film rights was a long, arduous task for Walt Disney.  P.L. Travers was a difficult, demanding, stodgy woman who had very definite ideas about how the story should--and should not--be made into film, and this movie is the tale of how she was brought around to agree to the final script.Emma Thompson, as &#34;Mrs. Travers&#34; (as she insisted people call her) is fantastic--a royal fuss-budget, enigmatic, mercurial--yet not unsympathetic.  The performance is magnificent.Tom Hanks does a credible Walt Disney, but what I remember most about ol' Walt was his syrupy voice, which Hanks doesn't quite capture.  Still, he has some moments that will bring tears to your eyes...unless you have a heart of stone, in which case you probably won't watch this movie in the first place.The real unsung hero of the movie, though, is Paul Giamatti, as Mrs. Travers' chauffeur.  He's a great actor (hard to believe this is the same guy who was the boxing manager in &#34;Cinderella Man&#34;), and he brings a real Everyman quality to Ralph.  He has a secret of his own, but even before this we get the sense that he's a pivotal element in events, even if completely unseen by Uncle Walt & Co.Another excellent performance is by Jason Schwartzman, as one of the Sherman brothers.  That's really him playing the piano--great work.Mrs. Travers' back-story is told through flashbacks to her childhood in Australia.  These are quite effective at giving us insight into her motivations, though I admit I could sense what was coming and I started to cringe every time the story took us back to the land of Oz (no, not that one).Maybe we can get a sense of what it's like to make a movie for the generations.  At one point, Mrs. Travers is frustrated with the script and asks &#34;Where's the gravitas?&#34; before tossing the pages out a window.  Well, for one thing, she possesses enough gravitas to bend light--but she makes a point; good children's entertainment isn't for simpletons.Anyway, be sure to bring a box of kleenex; you'll need them.  Whether you'll flash back to being a kid and seeing &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; for the first time, or one of the songs will touch your heart (I admit, I can't hear &#34;Feed the birds, tuppence a bag&#34; without a tear coming to my eye; I remember being a young kid and thinking about that poor old woman--Jane Darwell, I would learn later--reduced to selling bread crumbs to survive, and being struck by the tragedy ot it; that could be my grandmother!), or whether you identify with Walt or with Helen, or whether you just yearn for a time when a spoonful of sugar really could help the medicine go down, this movie will get to you.See it.  Buy it.  Buy copies for your friends.  They'll thank you.",5,"Really worth multiple viewings; a wonderful film for anyone who loves movies, Disney, and Disney movies",1394150400,"03 7, 2014",2014,3185,"[""'ve"", 'gotten', 'habit', 'setting', 'Expectation-o-Meter', '34', 'Low', '34', 'when', 'go', 'theater', 'Even', 'movies', 'get', 'great', 'reviews', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'dull.But', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'let', 'know', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'fact', 'only', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'paid', 'see', 'twice', 'two', 'consecutive', 'weeks.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'getting', 'author', '34', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '34', 'sell', 'film', 'rights', 'was', 'long', 'arduous', 'task', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'was', 'difficult', 'demanding', 'stodgy', 'woman', 'who', 'had', 'very', 'definite', 'ideas', 'how', 'story', 'should', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'made', 'film', 'movie', 'tale', 'how', 'was', 'brought', 'agree', 'final', 'script.Emma', 'Thompson', '34', 'Mrs.', 'Travers', '34', 'insisted', 'people', 'call', 'fantastic', 'royal', 'fuss-budget', 'enigmatic', 'mercurial', 'yet', 'not', 'unsympathetic', 'performance', 'magnificent.Tom', 'Hanks', 'credible', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'what', 'remember', 'most', 'ol', 'Walt', 'was', 'syrupy', 'voice', 'Hanks', ""n't"", 'quite', 'capture', 'Still', 'moments', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'eyes', 'have', 'heart', 'stone', 'case', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'first', 'place.The', 'real', 'unsung', 'hero', 'movie', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Mrs.', 'Travers', 'chauffeur', 'great', 'actor', 'hard', 'believe', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'boxing', 'manager', '34', 'Cinderella', 'Man', '34', 'real', 'Everyman', 'quality', 'Ralph', 'secret', 'own', 'even', 'get', 'sense', 'pivotal', 'element', 'events', 'even', 'completely', 'unseen', 'Uncle', 'Walt', 'Co.Another', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'one', 'Sherman', 'brothers', 'really', 'playing', 'piano', 'great', 'work.Mrs', 'Travers', 'back-story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'Australia', 'are', 'quite', 'effective', 'giving', 'insight', 'motivations', 'admit', 'could', 'sense', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'started', 'cringe', 'time', 'story', 'took', 'back', 'land', 'Oz', 'not', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'sense', 'what', 'make', 'movie', 'generations', 'one', 'point', 'Mrs.', 'Travers', 'frustrated', 'script', '34', 'Where', 'gravitas', '34', 'tossing', 'pages', 'out', 'window', 'Well', 'one', 'thing', 'enough', 'gravitas', 'bend', 'light', 'point', 'good', 'children', 'entertainment', ""n't"", 'simpletons.Anyway', 'be', 'sure', 'bring', 'box', 'kleenex', ""'ll"", 'need', ""'ll"", 'flash', 'back', 'being', 'kid', 'seeing', '34', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '34', 'first', 'time', 'one', 'songs', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'admit', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', '34', 'Feed', 'birds', 'tuppence', 'bag', '34', 'tear', 'coming', 'eye', 'remember', 'being', 'young', 'kid', 'thinking', 'poor', 'old', 'woman', 'Jane', 'Darwell', 'would', 'learn', 'later', 'reduced', 'selling', 'bread', 'crumbs', 'survive', 'being', 'struck', 'tragedy', 'could', 'be', 'grandmother', 'identify', 'Walt', 'Helen', 'just', 'yearn', 'time', 'when', 'spoonful', 'sugar', 'really', 'could', 'help', 'medicine', 'go', 'down', 'movie', 'will', 'get', 'you.See', 'Buy', 'Buy', 'copies', 'friends', ""'ll"", 'thank']",Saving Mr. Banks

1632941,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B00BEIYSL4,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[1, 1]","I think for two reasons: first, don't like stories where the lead has to be explained or made acceptable by a series of flashbacks, as if her present life is not story enough; and second, the character is just unappealing and I didn't care for her, not because the writer Mrs. Travers is unappealing, but because the writers didn't make the Mrs. Travers' character interesting and appealing. I think they tried to make her sympathetic with her kindness to her driver, but the story needed a whole lot more. the story is her, and I couldn't care less about the difficulty male characters in the 1960s had in manipulating her - they wanted something and were able to get it yet the story is them complaining about how hard she made it for them - she couldn't have been that tough as Mr. Disney got the rights. the story shown is not the story I wanted to see: male characters whining about a difficult woman but ultimately getting what they want from her. every character must carry their own weight - if you're going to make a story with an unappealing character at it's center, you should have a very good reason for it. what is it about Mrs. Travers that is so valuable that a film about aspects of her life needed to be made? the story shows what motivates her writing but why is that so important it needed a film? the acting is fine, Emma Thompson is always great, and I loved the guys, just, no story. I didn't like that they made her unattractive either, why did they choose that hairstyle? I don't care if the real Mrs. Travers wore her hair like that, the character should've worn a more attractive style.  She is the story: why deliberately make her unattractive? If the filmmakers don't like or respect some aspect of her character, why make the film?

1632944,A1DBBW9T4NW25T,B00BEIYSL4,Stephen John Vogel,"[1, 2]","Saving Mr. Banks will have a special appeal to those with a particular interest in films in which past and present are inextricably mingled.  Most people instinctively understand that their past life affects, sometimes decisively, their present reality, but most of us but are seldom confronted with the evidence in any explicit form. Certain films, like certain works of literature, bring us to this realization.In Saving Mr. Banks, the author P. L. Travers, author of the famous Mary Poppins books, travels from her home in London to Los Angeles in 1961 to meet with Walt Disney and the team he has assembled in the hopes of bringing the story of her famous flying nanny to the big screen. Travers is reluctant to turn over the rights to her characters, whom she thinks of as her family, for fear of what might become of them in the hands of Disney. As we discover through flashbacks to her childhood in Australia during the Edwardian era, Travers has good reasons for her protective stance, since her books are based on the lives of real family members. This is especially true in the case of her charming and beloved, but highly unstable, father, on whom the character of Mr. Banks is loosely based, and her aunt who arrived, like Mary Poppins, to try to set things in order.  Saving Mr. Banks alternates between the two eras, as Travers, the mature woman, must confront her girlhood memories which the planned film of her book oblige her to dredge up.  It's a difficult and often painful process, in which long-suppressed feelings are brought to light, and cherished assumptions are re-examined in a critical manner.This movie reminded me of another film, brought out in 1985, called Dreamchild. It also tells a story which is based on historical fact, that of the visit to America made by Alice Liddell Hargreaves, in the year 1932.  It was she who, as a child in Victorian England, inspired Lewis Carroll to write his famous Alice in Wonderland as a sort of tribute and a gift to her. Though her memories of that period in her life are mostly faded by the time she makes her American voyage at the age of 80, she, like Travis, is compelled to recall them, as the American public and the press hound her for details of her life as ""little Alice.""  Again, like Travis, many of the details which were long buried in her subconscious are painful for her to re-examine, owing to the complicated nature of her feelings toward the man who immortalized her in his writing.Of the two films, I think that Dreamchild does the better job of juxtaposing the scenes of past and present in the lives of the main female characters. It is clearer in the earlier film why the memories of the past have been so long suppressed and how the events in the life of the girl so many decades earlier have come to shape the life of the woman she has evolved into.  However, I can well imagine that someone else might feel the opposite, and believe that Saving Mr. Banks is the more satisfying film in that respect.  I would have to say that both do well, and my preference for Dreamchild, overall, is not meant to take away from the achievements of Saving Mr. Banks as a film about the mysterious ways in which memory works and about the lasting hold which the past can have over the present.",5,Time Remembered,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",2014,3273,"['Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'will', 'have', 'special', 'appeal', 'particular', 'interest', 'films', 'past', 'present', 'are', 'inextricably', 'mingled', 'Most', 'people', 'instinctively', 'understand', 'past', 'life', 'affects', 'sometimes', 'decisively', 'present', 'reality', 'most', 'are', 'seldom', 'confronted', 'evidence', 'explicit', 'form', 'Certain', 'films', 'certain', 'works', 'literature', 'bring', 'realization.In', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'author', 'P.', 'L.', 'Travers', 'author', 'famous', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'books', 'travels', 'home', 'London', 'Los', 'Angeles', '1961', 'meet', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'team', 'assembled', 'hopes', 'bringing', 'story', 'famous', 'flying', 'nanny', 'big', 'screen', 'Travers', 'reluctant', 'turn', 'over', 'rights', 'characters', 'whom', 'family', 'fear', 'what', 'might', 'become', 'hands', 'Disney', 'discover', 'flashbacks', 'childhood', 'Australia', 'Edwardian', 'era', 'Travers', 'good', 'reasons', 'protective', 'stance', 'books', 'are', 'based', 'lives', 'real', 'family', 'members', 'especially', 'true', 'case', 'charming', 'beloved', 'highly', 'unstable', 'father', 'whom', 'character', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'loosely', 'based', 'aunt', 'who', 'arrived', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'try', 'set', 'things', 'order', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'two', 'eras', 'Travers', 'mature', 'woman', 'must', 'confront', 'girlhood', 'memories', 'planned', 'film', 'book', 'dredge', 'up', 'difficult', 'often', 'painful', 'process', 'long-suppressed', 'feelings', 'are', 'brought', 'light', 'cherished', 'assumptions', 'are', 're-examined', 'critical', 'manner.This', 'movie', 'reminded', 'film', 'brought', 'out', '1985', 'called', 'Dreamchild', 'also', 'story', 'based', 'historical', 'fact', 'visit', 'America', 'made', 'Alice', 'Liddell', 'Hargreaves', 'year', '1932', 'was', 'who', 'child', 'Victorian', 'England', 'inspired', 'Lewis', 'Carroll', 'write', 'famous', 'Alice', 'Wonderland', 'sort', 'tribute', 'gift', 'memories', 'period', 'life', 'are', 'mostly', 'faded', 'time', 'American', 'voyage', 'age', '80', 'Travis', 'compelled', 'recall', 'American', 'public', 'press', 'hound', 'details', 'life', 'little', 'Alice', 'Again', 'Travis', 'many', 'details', 'were', 'long', 'buried', 'subconscious', 'are', 'painful', 're-examine', 'owing', 'complicated', 'nature', 'feelings', 'man', 'who', 'immortalized', 'writing.Of', 'two', 'films', 'think', 'Dreamchild', 'better', 'job', 'juxtaposing', 'scenes', 'past', 'present', 'lives', 'main', 'female', 'characters', 'clearer', 'earlier', 'film', 'why', 'memories', 'past', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'suppressed', 'how', 'events', 'life', 'girl', 'so', 'many', 'decades', 'earlier', 'have', 'come', 'shape', 'life', 'woman', 'evolved', 'However', 'can', 'well', 'imagine', 'someone', 'else', 'might', 'feel', 'opposite', 'believe', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'more', 'satisfying', 'film', 'respect', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'do', 'well', 'preference', 'Dreamchild', 'overall', 'not', 'meant', 'take', 'away', 'achievements', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'film', 'mysterious', 'ways', 'memory', 'works', 'lasting', 'hold', 'past', 'can', 'have', 'over', 'present']",Saving Mr. Banks

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[2, 2]","As I prepared to post this review here on Amazon, there are already 596 reviews posted for &#8220;Saving Mr. Banks&#8221;. I wanted to point out that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film together under each version. So you will find lots of reviews of the theatrical version here as well as review of the Amazon Instant version. Neither of these covers the bonus features on the DVD and Bluray. So I always recommend that buyers sort the reviews by &#8220;Most Recent&#8221; first and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing. With that said, on to the Bluray + Digital version.I had the chance to see this wonderful new film, when it premiered on the &#8220;big screen&#8221; here in Philadelphia.  I had just finished seeing (and reviewing here on Amazon) the then-newly released Bluray of the restored Mary Poppins as well as the Deluxe Version of soundtrack CD for Saving Mr. Banks (you can find my review here on Amazon as well.)I&#8217;ll try not to repeat many of the comments that other reviewers have covered but will give you my take on the film, which I loved. Emma Thompson is just great and so is Paul Giamatti (in a great supporting role). Tom Hanks does a decent Walt Disney but he still looks and sounds like Tom Hanks.  I really want to recommend that before seeing SMB, you should revisit (or see for the first time) the original &#8220;Mary Poppins&#8221; &#8211; especially the new restored version noted above. You will get much more out of SMB that way.The BD print is great with lots of what I call &#8220;Disney Color&#8221; to it. And the story &#8211; yes true &#8211; is fascinating.Unlike most Disney home video releases, this one is a bit frugal on &#8220;bonuses&#8221; but what&#8217;s here is nice. There are three &#8220;deleted scenes&#8221; (though no commentary to explain why they were deleted), including the one delted &#8220;musical number&#8221;: &#8220;The Nanny Song&#8221;. You can hear composer Richard Sherman sing this as well as other original &#8220;demos&#8221; as bonus tracks on the Deluxe version of the Soundtrack CD. These three scenes total seven minutes. Then there is a nice 14 1/2 &#8211;minute featurette &#8220;The Walt Disney Studios: From Poppins to the Present&#8221; that has SMB Director John Lee Hancock giving a tour of the old Annimation SBuilding and comments from the children of the original &#8220;Mary Poppins&#8221; animators. There are no interviews with any of the SMB cast. The last bonus is a clip of the full crew and most of the cast singing the song &#8220;Let&#8217;s Go Fly A Kite&#8221; &#8211; with Sherman playing the piano &#8211; on the last day of shooting. It runs just 1:47.While it&#8217;s not considered a &#8220;bonus&#8221; the BD has another nice feature not listed on the package. When you get to the menu screen you will see the Wollensak reel-to-reel tape recorder that appears in the scene where P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson&#8221; is hearing the Sherman brothers play their songs for the first time.  At the end of the film &#8211; over the credits &#8211; you will hear the actual records made by Travers. And they are repeated in the menu section as well. It gives a nice reality to the story.So do I recommend the film? Yes, absolutely &#8211; but more for adults who remember seeing &#8220;Mary Poppins&#8221; than for children. For everyone, though, go find and see the BD of MP! It&#8217;s brilliant.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",5,Review of the BD release with bonuses &#8211; Great &#8211; But watch the original &#8220;Mary Poppins&#8221; first,1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,3558,"['prepared', 'post', 'review', 'here', 'Amazon', 'are', 'already', '596', 'reviews', 'posted', '8220', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '8221', 'wanted', 'point', 'out', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'grouping', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'formats', 'film', 'together', 'version', 'will', 'find', 'lots', 'reviews', 'theatrical', 'version', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'review', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'version', 'covers', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'So', 'always', 'recommend', 'buyers', 'sort', 'reviews', '8220', 'Most', 'Recent', '8221', 'first', 'then', 'look', 'see', 'format', 'reviewer', 'discussing', 'said', 'Bluray', '+', 'Digital', 'version.I', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'wonderful', 'new', 'film', 'when', 'premiered', '8220', 'big', 'screen', '8221', 'here', 'Philadelphia', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'seeing', 'reviewing', 'here', 'Amazon', 'then-newly', 'released', 'Bluray', 'restored', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'as', 'well', 'Deluxe', 'Version', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'can', 'find', 'review', 'here', 'Amazon', 'as', 'well', '8217', 'try', 'not', 'repeat', 'many', 'comments', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'covered', 'will', 'give', 'take', 'film', 'loved', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'just', 'great', 'so', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'great', 'supporting', 'role', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'decent', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'still', 'like', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'really', 'want', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'SMB', 'should', 'revisit', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'original', '8220', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '8221', '8211', 'especially', 'new', 'restored', 'version', 'noted', 'will', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'SMB', 'way.The', 'BD', 'print', 'great', 'lots', 'what', 'call', '8220', 'Disney', 'Color', '8221', 'story', '8211', 'true', '8211', 'most', 'Disney', 'home', 'video', 'one', 'bit', 'frugal', '8220', 'bonuses', '8221', 'what', '8217', 's', 'here', 'nice', 'are', 'three', '8220', 'deleted', 'scenes', '8221', 'commentary', 'explain', 'why', 'were', 'deleted', 'including', 'one', 'delted', '8220', 'musical', 'number', '8221', '8220', 'Nanny', 'Song', '8221', 'can', 'hear', 'composer', 'Richard', 'Sherman', 'sing', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'original', '8220', '8221', 'bonus', 'tracks', 'Deluxe', 'version', 'Soundtrack', 'CD', 'three', 'scenes', 'total', 'seven', 'minutes', 'Then', 'nice', '14', '1/2', '8211', 'featurette', '8220', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Studios', 'From', 'Present', '8221', 'SMB', 'Director', 'John', 'Lee', 'Hancock', 'giving', 'tour', 'old', 'Annimation', 'SBuilding', 'comments', 'children', 'original', '8220', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '8221', 'animators', 'are', 'interviews', 'SMB', 'cast', 'last', 'bonus', 'clip', 'full', 'crew', 'most', 'cast', 'singing', 'song', '8220', 'Let', '8217', 'Go', 'Fly', 'A', 'Kite', '8221', '8211', 'Sherman', 'playing', 'piano', '8211', 'last', 'day', 'shooting', 'just', '1:47.While', '8217', 'not', 'considered', '8220', '8221', 'BD', 'nice', 'feature', 'not', 'listed', 'package', 'When', 'get', 'menu', 'screen', 'will', 'see', 'Wollensak', 'reel-to-reel', 'tape', 'recorder', 'scene', 'where', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'Emma', 'Thompson', '8221', 'hearing', 'Sherman', 'brothers', 'play', 'songs', 'first', 'time', 'end', 'film', '8211', 'credits', '8211', 'will', 'hear', 'actual', 'records', 'made', 'Travers', 'are', 'repeated', 'menu', 'section', 'well', 'nice', 'reality', 'story.So', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'Yes', 'absolutely', '8211', 'more', 'adults', 'who', 'remember', 'seeing', '8220', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '8221', 'children', 'everyone', 'though', 'go', 'find', 'see', 'BD', 'MP', '8217', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']",Saving Mr. Banks
1632950,A26MJME9IBNETY,B00BEIYSL4,StrangePegs,"[134, 154]","Saving Mr. Banks is the kind of film that Hollywood ought to love. It's about how one of the most beloved movies in movie history got made. And it's the first time Walt Disney has ever been portrayed in a movie, so that's saying a lot. And, just to put all of this perspective, when Disney first heard that the movie was being made, they're first reaction was to buy it and squash it. See, there's a reason Walt has never been portrayed onscreen before. However, after looking at it, they decided not only not to do that but to produce it! It's that kind of movie.And it's good. I mean, it's really good. I know it is because my wife cried through about the last third of it. I will be extremely surprised if it doesn't get the best picture Oscar this year. Overall, from what we've seen so far, I think it's most well rounded show out there. And it leaves you feeling good after having had a good cry.Not to get into what the movie is about, but it's about how Walt Disney convinced P. L. Travers to give him the rights to make Mary Poppins, something it took him 20 years to do. Along with that story, you see the story of the defining moment of Travers' childhood, which shows why Poppins was so important to her. From what I've seen from fact-checking, the movie is fairly accurate, which is another plus. A big one, actually. They did have hours and hours of audio recordings from sessions with Travers and some of the people working on the movie (because she insisted that everything be recorded), so they wouldn't have had a good excuse for it not being accurate.So, first, let's talk Tom Hanks. Oh, man, Tom Hanks was... incredible. There were moments, especially when they showed him watching himself on the old black and white TV show Walt introduced, where he was just like Disney. And, from everything I've read, Hanks did capture Walt to an amazing extent. I do know that the folks at Disney Studios shaved Hanks' mustache to the exact dimensions that Walt wore his. His only being called a supporting actor for this role, but I think it's a safe bet that he will at least get a nomination for it. I will not at all be surprised if he wins. Actually, I hope he does. [I haven't seen Captain Phillips, yet, but he's also being talked about for a best actor nomination for that one.]Then, we have to talk Emma Thompson, and she may just deserve best actress for her performance. That's a tough call for me, though, because Sandra Bullock carried an entire movie virtually by herself, and that's an impressive feat. However, I'm not sure anyone else could have pulled off Travers the way Thompson did. It was a great performance, and she and Hanks were perfect together.Paul Giamatti was lovable as Ralph, the chauffeur. This role probably wasn't especially difficult for Giamatti, but he was perfect in it. Jason Schwartzman and B. J. Novak were awesome as Richard and Robert Sherman. Not the parts called for too much, but it was great to see them in the movie. They were good, too. Especially this one part with Novak, but I don't want to spoil it, so you'll just have to see it; then, I'll tell you which one.Which brings us to Colin Farrell. Farrell is one of those underrated actors who is almost always excellent despite the horrible movies he's in. I mean, Alexander wasn't really his fault, and how can you blame him for not turning down Total Recall? At any rate, he's wonderful and wonderfully tragic as Travers Goff. He was my favorite part of the movie. I mentioned that my wife cried, but there were some scenes of Goff with his daughter where I almost cried. That's kind of saying a lot for me.I loved this movie. Of the possible best picture nominees, if you have to pick just one, this is the one I would recommend. Sure, Gravity is visually amazing, but this movie has heart that Gravity just doesn't have, no matter how you feel about Walt Disney. And let me make this clear, the movie is not about Walt Disney; the script was written (and not changed) before Disney (the Company) had a hand in it; the movie is about Travers and how she was ultimately convinced to allow Walt to make Mary Poppins into a movie.

One movie is an excellent movie, with deep themes that are universal and important to me as an individual, and a great experience such as I haven't seen from Disney in too long, plus it's probably as close as we'll get on film to P. L. Travers's version of Mary Poppins, something I'm grateful for.The second movie is a movie that is lying to us--worse, it doesn't even do such a good job of hiding the truth in that regard, you just have to not be paying attention or thinking about things (and also be ignorant of anything outside of this movie) in order to fall for it.Perhaps it's fitting that I have this particular attitude to this movie, which combined with the fact that I don't want to knock off any more stars because of what they got right, makes me feel good that my 3-star review would still be considered a &#34;good&#34; review.I'll explain what I meant in my above assessment:First, the good movie review:This movie is about universal themes that matter to me personally, and I must give credit for that.  Such themes include the relationship between parents and children, and in particular what is the best course of action when children learn, as they inevitably will, that their parents aren't perfect and aren't in control of everything, and others of life's disappointments; what is the appropriate worldview to have and to teach to our children given this, and in particular what is the appropriate role of children's stories in that regard?  P. L. Travers chose one way, Walt Disney chose another, and their respective reasons had to do with their relationships with their respective fathers.  Her father was imaginative but irresponsible and used imagination as a buffer against hard truths of life, while Disney's father was practical, cheap, utilitarian and short-tempered.  While both loved their fathers, they reacted to this by becoming just the opposite: P. L. Travers is honest to the point of tactlessness, preferring gloom to cheer; Disney is warm and down to earth, with a love of fairy tales and a determination to disarm even the most devoted cold prickly.  Speaking for myself, I think neither worldview was completely right, but neither was completely wrong.  We shouldn't sugarcoat the truth and thereby set our children up for disappointment unnecessarily, but at the same time, stories are meant to reassure us that, while evil exists (and children will learn this naturally without help from stories), it is finite, and can be defeated, even if we don't experience that all the time in real life--and so we have hope.  That being the case, I thought the movie did a good job of being fair to both sides.Another good thing about the film is that, as I said, since Disney owns the film rights, we're probably never going to get as close as this to seeing P. L. Travers's Mary Poppins, although what we see of that here is brief, and is a dramatization of the inspiration for Mary Poppins: the author's Aunt Ellie coming to take charge of things and restore order in the house.  That's still better than nothing, and I found the flashbacks informative, both as to why the books were the way they were, and why the author didn't like Disney's take on it.  We do see Aunt Ellie's carpet bag and parrot-headed umbrella, and she does say &#34;Spit-spot&#34; (which the real Helen Morehead did).  Forget Rachel Griffiths's performance: the LOOK was enough to sell me on it.Also, this is the first time I've ever seen Walt Disney being portrayed by another actor, and Tom Hanks does a surprisingly good job.  The first time I saw the movie I felt like I was there, meeting the real Walt Disney for the first time, especially at Disneyland!  That's no small feat because I've seen Tom Hanks and I've seen Walt Disney and I know what they're like, and I wouldn't have pegged Tom Hanks for Walt Disney.  But he disappears into the role surprisingly well.  I also appreciate the fact that while they don't sugarcoat Walt Disney (in one scene he hastily puts out a lit cigarette, saying he doesn't want to encourage bad habits), neither are they slandering him by tearing down an idol--they're just portraying him as a man, with his good points but also with his flaws, just like the rest of us.Finally, this movie is a better experience than most recent Disney fare (a shame because Beauty and the Beast wasn't that long ago, just one generation), and the fact that this film features the songs from Walt Disney's Mary Poppins goes a long way in making it so.  I really felt taken back to that &#34;young at heart&#34; place that Disney has been missing for so long.  Just try to stay in your seat during the &#34;Let's Go Fly a Kite&#34; segment--I dare you.  Especially coming on the heels of the &#34;Fidelity Fiduciary Bank&#34; scene, it is excellent--those two are the real highlights of the movie, at least for me.  Not only is this film better than most recent Disney movies, it's better than most of the movies I've seen that are about the same thing, about the creation of fabulous literary characters that are now beloved favorites (for example, Finding Neverland).With regard to this &#34;good&#34; movie, my only lament (but I understand why it was so) is that we don't see David Tomlinson (the actor who portrayed Mr. Banks) being depicted here, or his relationship with either P. L. Travers or Walt Disney--I don't even know what kind of relationship he had with either.  I understand why it was so, though, so I'm willing to overlook that: that would either require them to not show any part of the Disney version of Mary Poppins at the end, or else to dramatize it with younger actors for the sake of consistency, and either approach would have lost something, I think.  So that's fine.Now, alas, I have to give the bad movie review:In a nutshell, what this film claims to be about is the following:P. L. Travers was born Helen Goff, who had a special relationship with her playful, imaginative father, but then learned the hard way that he was an alcoholic who kept getting fired from his job at the bank, and he used his imagination and creativity as a buffer against the hard truths of his life, and to shield Helen from discovering this disappointment.  Her Aunt Ellie then came to restore order and save the family (though tragically Mr. Travers Goff died from alcohol poisoning), and she was the anti-Travers Goff: strict, no-nonsense, intimidating, not fun or friendly.  And yet there was a gratitude on Helen's part to her for restoring order and for not shielding her from even hard truths like her father's death.This then inspired the Mary Poppins books, and Helen Goff took the name Pamela Travers as an adult, as a tribute to her father.  She was so resistant to Disney adapting the book (refusing him every year for over 20 years before caving because she needed the money) because it was so personal to her and she felt she would be betraying her father, since she knew Disney would change it beyond recognition, and she wasn't wrong.  But then, according to this film, what finally changed her mind was when Disney realized the hidden point behind the books: Mary Poppins didn't come to save the children, but Mr. Banks--or rather, Mr. Goff, the author's father.  And so Disney promised that, creative liberties aside, that part would be respected, and Mr. Banks would be redeemed for all the movie audiences to see and hear--and so while Travers Goff didn't get the chance in life, Mr. Banks did in fiction.A nice little fairy tale, but the evidence suggests that it is not true at all, which is why I say maybe it's fitting that I feel about it as I do, given what this movie is about.  This movie is to the truth what Disney's Mary Poppins is to Travers's Mary Poppins.  It is a fairy tale that uses the reality to tell a fictional story--the facts seem to be more or less true beyond what is necessary to make a better film, but they are interpreted in a way contrary to what is most obvious.  Likewise, I can't bring myself to hate or even dislike this movie because of what it gets so right, as I said above--so that it is not unlike a love-hate relationship with a loved one who has a deep flaw that I can't do anything about, frustrating me.The evidence is contrary to the interpretation this film gives, and while some of that evidence is outside the film, some of it is inside the film, which arguably makes it condescending to the audience.  The evidence we see is that Mr. Banks as portrayed in Walt Disney's Mary Poppins was based on Walt's father Elias Disney, not Travers Goff, and was really the anti-Travers Goff.  Travers Goff needed saving in the sense of being more responsible, treating his alcoholism, and being more of a father than a &#34;pal&#34; to his offspring.  Elias Disney, like Mr. Banks in the movie, needed saving in the sense of appreciating things like art and fairy tales for their own sake, rather than just practical considerations like how much money you could get for them, and not being so cheap, and not being so short-tempered with his children.More obvious is that, where Disney and Travers disagreed on what should be in the film, Disney got his way on just about everything, and we're not really made to understand why Mrs. Travers went along with it.  Her point was that Mary Poppins is both a strict, intimidating nanny type and also magical, so that the juxtaposition of two things that don't go together was the point--and also for her to be a port in a storm of whimsy, defeating it all with a sniff of contempt.  But the nanny tradition was foreign to American audiences, so Disney felt the need to make it more palatable, hence some of the changes that Mrs. Travers didn't like here (the Banks family being aristocrats instead of middle class everypersons, Mrs. Banks being a silly suffragette rather than a stay-at-home wife and mother): indeed, Disney's point was that a nanny isn't necessary at all if the family is working together as they should, so that Mary Poppins came to reconcile them all, but covertly and subtly so that no one guesses this except us the audience, and she leaves once she's no longer needed (she kept coming back in the books).  What's more, it isn't really clear from either the flashbacks in this film or the Disney film of Mary Poppins why the focus is so much on Mr. Banks, when both Mrs. Goff and Disney's Mrs. Banks needed redeeming too.My guess is that the screenwriters connected certain dots that didn't really match up: the facts surrounding her childhood and relationship with her father (and his untimely demise) seem to ring true, and she did take her father's first name as her last name, indicating a closeness there, and her Aunt Ellie did come to save the family and restore order, and Disney's film does redeem Mr. Banks.  But aside from the evidence being to the contrary, no real indication is given for why she objected so to the Disneyfication other than a sort of &#34;Freudian&#34; explanation, as if she subconsciously imagined that the changes were personal attacks upon herself and her family, especially her father, as opposed to a more mature, adult, reasonable expectation that, since the story wouldn't exist without her, her wishes should be respected at least to a certain degree even if you have to be flexible (which she was to some degree).  This has the effect of Mrs. Travers needing to be &#34;saved from herself&#34;, with Walt Disney as the handsome prince coming to her rescue, but she herself is the antagonist (not the villain) to herself as protagonist--she is both the princess and the wicked witch combined in one character.In any case, the evidence suggests something far different, and the part of the evidence that you don't get from this film or even this film combined with Walt Disney's Mary Poppins is that the Mr. Banks characterization and the generic plot of practical father needing redemption and a magical figure intervening so that the father is reconciled with his children in the end is not new for Disney.  It was there in Peter Pan, and it would be there in The Sword in the Stone.  It's clear that this common &#34;Disney formula&#34;, this backbone to the various stories that Walt Disney adapted, is his own attempt to redeem his father Elias Disney through fiction.  In other words, P. L. Travers's childhood and relationship with her father arguably don't even enter into the equation at all, where the Disney version of Mary Poppins is concerned.  Combined with what we do see in this film, it seems more likely that the Disney version of Mary Poppins was no concession to P. L. Travers at all, but a culmination of Walt Disney's career and life, something he had done before but in imperfect form.From a fairy tale standpoint (I don't know the reality), that would almost suggest that P. L. Travers signed over the rights out of sympathy for a kindred soul (if in the opposite direction from herself), someone who also had a difficult childhood and complex relationship with his father, and so found something personal in her work that conflicted with what was personal to herself about it.  While I feel like I want to empathize with Walt Disney, just as I felt like I wanted to empathize with P. L. Travers in this film, that indicates that Disney and his people were less considerate of Mrs. Travers than they are depicted in this film.  That combined with her being portrayed as a Freudian case, both princess and wicked witch in one, feels to me (though admittedly I am ignorant of the facts) like it is being unfair to P. L. Travers in favor of Disney, even while it looks like it's the other way around.That, in a nutshell, is why there is a bad part of this movie--it's pulling the wool over our eyes as though we were either very little or very stupid or so easily distracted that we don't pay attention or think things through, and that can be construed as condescending to us.Quite frankly, I feel like I want to be a Walt Disney to this film: I was inspired by it, but to the extent that some of what I appreciate about it is not actually in the film, and I would have done it differently.  The good parts are too good, in my opinion, to throw the baby out with the bathwater--at the same time, however, I would be doing a disservice to ignore the bad parts.  If you haven't seen the film yet, watch it for the themes, the performances, the experience, and to see the closest we'll probably get on film to the original Mary Poppins untouched by Disney--but be prepared for the film that is jingling keys in front of your face and telling you they aren't there, and don't fall for it.  If it helps, learn more about the real P. L. Travers and the real Walt Disney--and to end this review on a positive note, it does seem like the kind of movie that would inspire you to do just that, and that may just outweigh the bad parts enough to where I can feel good about giving this film a &#34;good&#34; review even if it's only just on the &#34;good&#34; side.",3,I wish I could give this movie two reviews....,1391644800,"02 6,

1632974,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B00BEIYSL4,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[2, 2]","&#8220;Saving Mr. Banks&#8221; is the embellished story of the uneasy collaboration between &#8220;Mary Poppins&#8221; author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) and Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) and his creative team. Disney mounts an extravagant charm offensive to secure the rights to the author&#8217;s famous creation.Travers is depicted as cantankerous, argumentative, rigid, and highly protective of her magical nanny. She also has little knowledge of the movie-making process, which becomes a difficult problem for Disney himself and his beleaguered staff. They are doing their best to wine and dine her, but she is wary of losing control and letting the studio turn &#8220;Mary Poppins&#8221; into just one more in a long line of animated features.Ms. Thompson and Mr. Hanks both do a fine job, though it&#8217;s hard not to suspect quite a bit of Disney-fying of the characters as well as the story. We see long stretches in flashback of Travers&#8217; youth in Australia and the devoted relationship with her father (Colin Farrell), who loved to spin yarns. But life&#8217;s hard knocks have molded her into a cold, arrogant, condescending presence who intimidates and even frightens those whose only goal is to make a good movie. Disney, in contrast, is depicted as all heart. The character of Ralph (Paul Giamatti), the chauffeur assigned to Travers in California, is on hand as a humanizing device. His soft-spoken manner and his personal burden helps put Travers&#8217; concerns about &#8220;Mary Poppins&#8221; in perspective.If you know a bit about P.L. Travers' background, you will see that the facts of her life have often been skewed in the film to polish the image of the Disney machine and Walt himself. However, the movie is entertaining in its own right and offers a behind-the-scenes look at the making of a certifiable classic.The Blu-ray edition contains deleted scenes, a tour of the Disney Studio, reminiscences by Disney employees who worked with Travers, and a tribute to composer Richard Sherman with a rousing rendition of &#8220;Let&#8217;s Go Fly a Kite&#8221; by cast and crew.",4,The Confrontation of Two Forces of Nature,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,2101,"['8220', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', '8221', 'embellished', 'story', 'uneasy', 'collaboration', '8220', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '8221', 'author', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'creative', 'team', 'Disney', 'extravagant', 'charm', 'offensive', 'secure', 'rights', 'author', '8217', 'famous', 'creation.Travers', 'depicted', 'cantankerous', 'argumentative', 'rigid', 'highly', 'protective', 'magical', 'nanny', 'also', 'little', 'knowledge', 'movie-making', 'process', 'difficult', 'problem', 'Disney', 'beleaguered', 'staff', 'are', 'doing', 'best', 'wine', 'dine', 'wary', 'losing', 'control', 'letting', 'studio', 'turn', '8220', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '8221', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'long', 'line', 'animated', 'features.Ms', 'Thompson', 'Mr.', 'Hanks', 'do', 'fine', 'job', '8217', 's', 'hard', 'not', 'suspect', 'quite', 'bit', 'Disney-fying', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'see', 'long', 'stretches', 'flashback', 'Travers', '8217', 'Australia', 'devoted', 'relationship', 'father', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'loved', 'spin', 'yarns', 'life', '8217', 'hard', 'knocks', 'have', 'molded', 'cold', 'arrogant', 'condescending', 'presence', 'who', 'even', 'frightens', 'only', 'goal', 'make', 'good', 'movie', 'Disney', 'contrast', 'depicted', 'heart', 'character', 'Ralph', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'chauffeur', 'assigned', 'Travers', 'California', 'hand', 'humanizing', 'device', 'soft-spoken', 'manner', 'personal', 'burden', 'put', 'Travers', '8217', 'concerns', '8220', 'Mary', 'Poppins', '8221', 'perspective.If', 'know', 'bit', 'P.L', 'Travers', 'background', 'will', 'see', 'facts', 'life', 'have', 'often', 'been', 'skewed', 'film', 'polish', 'image', 'Disney', 'machine', 'Walt', 'However', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'own', 'right', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'making', 'certifiable', 'classic.The', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'contains', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'tour', 'Disney', 'Studio', 'reminiscences', 'Disney', 'employees', 'who', 'worked', 'Travers', 'tribute', 'composer', 'Richard', 'Sherman', 'rousing', 'rendition', '8220', 'Let', '8217', 'Go', 'Fly', 'Kite', '8221', 'cast', 'crew']",Saving Mr. Banks
1632975,ALJLONJXLA3OQ,B00BEIYSL4,The People's Critic,"[9, 12]","When nominations were being made for the 2014 Golden Globes, I read that if Saving Mr. Banks were to get a nomination, it would have been in the drama category.  That sounded odd.  I mean Tom Hanks as Walt Disney trying to get the author of Mary Poppins to sign over movie rights, a drama?  Now, the Golden Globes don&#8217;t always get it right &#8211; it&#8217;s kind of their thing, but regarding Saving Mr. Banks as a drama &#8211; they were right about this one.It may seem a bit self-indulgent for a movie studio to make a movie about how amazing they were when they made another movie, but there&#8217;s more to this story than just that.  Primarily, Saving Mr. Banks is the behind the scenes story of Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) furiously courting writer P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) in the hopes of getting her to sign over the movie rights to her Mary Poppins children&#8217;s books. Hanks summons all of the likability of well, Tom Hanks, to portray the larger than life filmmaker.  His motive is to fulfill a promise to his daughters 20 years in the making, that he would produce a film about their favorite childhood books.  Travers is the holdout as she has seen Disney&#8217;s films over the past 20 years and does not want her beloved characters to be romping around stage, singing, and worst of all&#8230;as cartoons!  In 1961, Disney finally convinces Travers to at least visit Los Angeles, sit in with the writers, and see what happens.Travers is a terror on Disney, his writers, and his staff.  Her arrogant British ways are on full display, but it is clear that she has high defenses for a reason; these characters are important to her for reasons Disney can not possibly understand.  Director, John Lee Hancock explores the layers of Travers through flashback, sporadically inserting scenes of her childhood with her parents Travers (Colin Farrell) and Margaret (Ruth Wilson).  Through these flashbacks, the audience gets a rueful sense of Poppins&#8217; origin.  Hancock and his editors are brilliant at sensing when these scenes are necessary.  This is especially evident in a fine scene set to the Mary Poppins song, &#8220;Feed the Birds.&#8221;Cleary, Mary Poppins becomes a film and a film beloved by generations of people for 50 years now, so whether the film is made is not a source of tension whatsoever.  The strength of the film is in its way that Travers and Disney slowly are able to find common ground.  Doubtless, we are seeing some revisionist history.  I&#8217;m sure that if another studio had been granted the rights to tell this story, we might get a different vision of Walt Disney, the man.  However, Saving Mr. Banks does not seek to disparage its characters.  Rather, it desires to explore some of the &#8220;magic&#8221; that makes characters and stories meaningful to us.  The film is actually quite clever in its construction as it subtly mirrors the conflict in Mary Poppins through Travers&#8217;s fear of what blind capitalism might do to something she sees as so precious and pure.Disney fans will also find much to enjoy as the nostalgia level is through the roof and hypnotizing.  Memorable songs from Mary Poppins are strewn all over the film, and it is very enjoyable to watch these songs develop and be performed all over again.  In one scene, as Paul Giamatti&#8217;s character, Ralph, drives Travers into Walt Disney Land for the first time, he may as well come back and pick us up too!  In fact, during the credits photos of Walt Disney and all of the characters from the film are displayed and a real audio sample of the real P.L. Travers bossing around the writers can be heard.  The film is laced with Disney, but the contact high is pleasant.Thompson is irrepressibly repressive as Travers.  It is a delight to see her take the lead again for the first time since reprising her role as Nanny McPhee in 2010; however, this is her finest and most substantial performance in many years.  By the end of the film, she has the audience in the palm of her hand and conveniently one of the film&#8217;s final scenes takes place in a movie theater where the audience has no choice but to fully experience and empathize with her literally from per point of view.  Hanks does an ample and sufficient job as Disney, but most of his scenes involve making puzzled looks or smiling a lot.  There are several times throughout the film where viewers will ask themselves, &#8220;how is he ever going to get this woman to sign over the rights?&#8221; and he succeeds in making us understand, chiefly thanks to one fine speech towards the film&#8217;s end.  Otherwise, Hanks is a recognizable caricature.  It is certainly P.L. Travers&#8217;s story, but it would have been nice to get a bit more into Disney&#8217;s head than this film had intended.Saving Mr. Banks is a surprisingly rich contextual film, appropriately layered to tell not one but two deeply related stories.  I was surprised how caught up I found myself with the flashback scenes and consequently with how much I liked this film.  A-Saving Mr. Banks is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 2 hours.",4,Saving Mr. Banks,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",2013,5108,"['When', 'nominations', 'were', 'being', 'made', '2014', 'Golden',

The film employs a dual narrative, with one thread set during her two weeks in 1961 LA, and the other following her childhood in Australia.

Whatever the truth is, I was interested in this complicated character in spite of / because of her personality. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Tom Hanks' Walt Disney lacking complexity.Interestingly, the interaction between Travers and her (probably fictional) chauffeur in LA (played by Paul Giamatti) is more credible and interesting than that between her and Disney.

1632993,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00BEIYSL4,Turfseer,"[4, 14]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Walt Disney had been trying to obtain the rights to make 'Mary Poppins' into a film for years, but P.L. Travers, its highly critical author, wouldn't budge. Finally in 1961, faced with diminishing financial assets, Travers agreed to Disney's proposal with the proviso that she have the last say in regards to creative control of the script.In 'Saving Mr. Banks', Travers is depicted as the film's 'heavy' and Disney as the understanding 'good guy'. In reality, Travers was a much more complicated person than the stereotyped martinet who puts the Disney creative team through a living hell. The film's scenarists posit a simplistic scenario in which Travers' difficult childhood is the reason she grows up to be such a sourpuss. A good part of the film features flashbacks to Travers' early childhood in Queensland, Australia, where her highly imaginative father (well-played by Colin Farrell) encourages the young Travers' creativity but cannot control his own, very sad addiction to alcohol.The childhood flashbacks prove to be a ponderous affair and could have been easily done in one or two short but compact, all-encompassing scenes. Perhaps it would have been better to show Travers' life as she progressed into adulthood. Hardly someone who was narrow-minded (as some might get the impression here), Travers had a career as an actress and poet in her younger days, had a number of bisexual lovers, adopted a child when she was 40, spent two summers on different Native American reservations and was an astute student of the mystic, George Gurdjieff.Disney, on the other hand, is depicted as an eccentric uncle type that everyone loved. Tom Hanks ably conveys the 'good' side of Disney but visually fails to convey his true craggy look--a visage worn down by years of smoking cigarettes (Disney would never allow himself to be shown smoking in public and this fact is actually alluded to in 'Saving Mr. Banks'). Perhaps we needed a few flashbacks also for Mr. Disney, whose dark side included flirtations during the 40s with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, an anti- semitic, anti-communist organization (he distanced himself from the organization in the 50s) as well as testifying before the House of Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC), also in the 40s, against a number of liberal Hollywood writers, some of whom ended up being blacklisted (something that Mr. Hanks probably would have been appalled by me, had he been living as an adult, back then).Nonetheless, it is true that while working on the film version of Mary Poppins, Travers (in some measure), was devoted to playing the part of a curmudgeon. Travers stipulated that the creative sessions between her and the writing team be recorded on tape; thus a good deal of the hilarious interchanges, are utilized by the films' scenarists to illustrate just how far Ms. Travers would go in preserving the integrity of her intellectual property. Sometimes her demands were off the wall like not allowing the color 'red' to be used anywhere in the film. But not everything she objected to was unreasonable. Take for example, her violent distaste for the use of animation in the film. That, actually, constitutes the 'dark moment' at the end of Act II, when Travers bolts Disney headquarters (with unsigned contract in tow) and returns to England, vowing never to see Mary Poppins completed as a movie, precisely because of Walt Disney's desire to insert a small sequence involving dancing Penguins (Having seen clips of those dancing penguins, I can completely understand why Ms. Travers was upset!).The rest of the plot involves how Disney and company (along with the help of Travers' chauffeur, played by the always interesting Paul Giamatti) managed to soften Travers up and convince her to give up her rights, so that 'Mary Poppins' could finally get made.. Here, 'good' Disney shines; I don't know whether this actually happened, but Disney expresses empathy for Travers, when he recalls how he was very protective of his own invention, Mickey Mouse, when others were out to change his concept. I do know Disney did not fly all the way to England to convince Travers to change her mind, but Hanks gives his most impassioned speech of the movie when he links the history of his own creative career to that of Travers, during their face off in the UK.The Disney creative team also becomes more 'sensitive' to Travers' desire to ensure that her father's legacy is not tarnished. Hence, they 'save' Mr. Banks by not making him a 'pathetic' character (a drunkard in real life) but one who loves children and always wants to help them (he fixes the kite and the Sherman Brothers, end up penning the enormously catchy, 'Let's Go Fly a Kite."")The scenarists revert to comedy when Travers invites herself to the Mary Poppins Hollywood premiere after Disney declines to issue an invitation (Disney's fear is that she'll muck things up at the premiere, acting as a loose cannon). While Travers is watching the animated penguin sequence, you can see tears streaming down her cheeks. Disney leans over, and says something to her, to the effect that the animation didn't turn out to be so bad after all; but Travers explains she's crying because she still finds the animation repulsive.'Saving Mr. Banks' is an affectionate look at a small piece of entertainment history. It pulls at the heart strings but one still must look at it with a jaded eye. It's a film that was vetted beforehand by the Disney Corporation, who were bent on protecting their founder's reputation at any cost. The result is a slight loss of prestige for P.L. Travers. Nonetheless, she was the one who got the last laugh, by barring any future film sequels and insisting on only British writers working on a Mary Poppins musical.",3,It will successfully tug at your heart strings only if you ignore the one dimensional portraits of its principal protagonists,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,5834,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Walt', 'Disney',

I came out with a smile on my face.There were times when I laughed, teared up, shared Walt's frustration, and Travers' desire to keep her characters from becoming too &#34;Hollywood-ized&#34;.All actors/actresses portrayed their parts wonderfully. From the children to the adults, I felt my emotions openly ride on their performance! My favorite scene had to be the &#34;Let's go Fly a Kite&#34; sequence. I'd of given the Disney team quite the applause for all their hard work! (And a raise! Travers' was difficult to take at points.)It was fun to see them weave in so many of the Mary Poppins ideas through-out the movie: During a song Travers' dancing feet imitate the same steps that Poppins' does during her famous &#34;Stepping Time&#34; scene and how Travers' father talks about their horse &#34;Uncle Albert&#34; and how he was changed into one because of the sound of his laugh. There were many more.Not sure how much of the movie's facts were real, but honestly, I don't care.

The portrayal of L.A. and how things were at Disney seemed like someone's idea of what a 'Disneyfied' business' might be like.

She went on to be sure that no one could make a film of her work again, although she gave the rights to someone who is in process of producing a play.Many things in the movie were true. She had an alcoholic father who may or may not have been also a swindler-who droped dead when she was 7. Her Mother did abandon her, and attempt suicide, after her Father died. She later returned.Travers had to take care of her siblings during her Mother's long abscenes. She shows the signs of the plight of the alcoholic's child-who is burdened with caring for the parent, and trying, endlessly, to 'save' him. Everything reversed-the child burdened with the impossible task of taking care of the parent, meanwhile, not receiving the care and attention she needs and deserves.She apparently gave rights for someone to create a play, Mary Poppins.

1633013,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B00BEIYSL4,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[138, 150]","Saving Mr. Banks is the story of how Walt Disney came to make what is now regarded as his masterpiece: the much seen and much loved Mary Poppins, which was based on the series of very popular childrens books by P.L. Travers.  Or rather, this _a_ version of the story.  A somewhat sanitized and highly romanticized version.  The real story unfolded rather differently.  But that said, Saving Mr. Banks is at its heart, after all, a story and not a documentary, and in that context it's a highly enjoyable story.Directed by John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side, The Rookie) from a screenplay by Kelly Marcel (Terra Nova) and Sue Smith, (The Road from Coorain), Saving Mr. Banks is set in California in 1961 but flashes back to Australia in 1907 and Travers' early childhood.Walt Disney (winningly played by Tom Hanks) has a problem.  Many years ago, when his two daughters were quite young, he made a promise to them that he would make a movie of their favorite story-book character, Mary Poppins, the heroine of the series of popular books by English author P.L. Travers.  His problem is that Travers (a bravura performance by Emma Thompson) doesn't want to sell him the screen rights to make the movie and has been refusing to do so for two decades.  But Ms. Travers also has a problem - money.  Her books aren't selling as well as they once did, and the only way out of her financial situation seems to be agreeing to meet with Disney about finally selling him the screen rights.  This quickly becomes a clash between Disney's charming but determined irresistible force and Travers' seemingly immovable objections to everything about the project, which despite her needs she seems determined to prevent.  It seems that the negotiations are doomed to fail, but then, as we have come expect from anything Disney ""like a bolt out of the blue, fate steps in and sees you through"".  How that happens, and why, is what the movie is really about.The performances are excellent.  Tom Hanks' Disney is engaging, showing the man's charm and his frustrations but also his determination to realize his dream.  It's interesting that in some ways Hanks may end up competing with himself at Oscar time for his performance in this year's Captain Phillips, where he also played a man caught up in a clash of wills, albeit a more desperate one.  Emma Thompson (Sense and Sensibility, Howard's End) is a certainty for an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of a very complex Travers, showing how Mary Poppins was not merely a literary creation - it was her way of trying to reconcile her inner conflicts over her difficult childhood, in particular her relationship with her father, Travers Goff, the real-life basis for the Mr. Banks of the title.  Colin Farrell gives a stand-out performance as Goff, one of the best of his career, showing the man's complex nature, from his all-too-obvious flaws to the part of him that still managed to endear himself in his daughter's memory.  Paul Giamatti shows his nice side as Ralph, Traver's driver, who gives her a sympathetic ear to turn to in the midst of people she deems adversaries.  One of the more moving scenes in the movie occurs when Giamatti's Ralph explains to Travers just why he's so seemingly focused on the weather and why every sunny day is a good day.  It's rather startling actually to see Giamatti play nice after having just seen his decidedly nasty turn as a slave dealer in 12 Years a Slave.  The Disney creative team was particularly well done. Bradley Whitford (The Good Guys, The West Wing) plays Don DaGradi, Disney's top screenwriter, and B.J. Novak (The Office, Inglourious Basterds) and Jason Schwartzman (Moonrise Kingdom, The Darjeeling Limited) are remarkably paired as the song-writing brothers Robert and Richard Sherman, all of whom are just as anxious as Disney to win Travers over. Their scenes give remarkable insight into the creative process involved not only in adapting a novel for film but in adapting to try and please and/or placate a difficult author at the same time.Also worth noting is the musical score by Thomas Newman (Wall-E, Skyfall) which nicely adds to the emotions being displayed on the screen and evokes the varying time and place of the scenes, using wistful lilting melodies and occasional subdued overtones for Travers' childhood in rural Australia and more modern sounds with a slightly faster pace for 1960's California. It's something of a challenge to pull off without the shifts feeling jarring but Newman manages it quite well. And equally impressive is John Schwartzman's cinematography as it brings both settings to vivid life, seamlessly switching from one to the other as the story unfolds.But as I indicated at the beginning, one should remember that this is a more than a little sanitized and sentimentalized version of not only the events that took place but of the people themselves, particularly Disney and Travers. For example, at no point in the film is Hanks' Disney ever seen smoking even though for most of his adult life Disney was a notorious chain-smoker, ultimately dying of lung cancer just two years after the Mary Poppins film was released). Neither is there any real hint of how ruthless and even cold Disney could be. The Disney you see here is the warm ""Uncle Walt"" version that he carefully crafted for himself, not the man who notoriously sacked child actor Bobby Driscoll after the release of Peter Pan or Tommy Kirk, star of many Disney films and the Mickey Mouse Club TV show, after he found out that Kirk was gay. Thompson's P.L. Travers also gets a scrubbing, making her an overly fussy and lonely but oh-so-proper Englishwoman, completely at odds with her rather Bohemian younger years and the multiple romantic relationships she had in her life with members of both sexes. And who in reality never married even though in the film she repeatedly insists on being addressed as ""Mrs. Travers"". Nor is there anything but the slightest hint of her adopted son, the story of which would have revealed her own rather cold and ruthless side. But again, this isn't a documentary - it's a story, and as such should be enjoyed for what it is. No more, no less.One final note - make sure to stay through the end credits, where they not only show photos of all of the real people depicted in the film but also play one of the actual tape-recorded planning sessions between Travers and the Disney team. Those scenes - along with the ones of Travers' early childhood in Australia - were the most factually accurate parts of the movie.Highly recommended as an entertaining version of an important episode of Disney movie history.  The real-life version is out there for anyone who wants to look it up and it's quite interesting in its own right, but this version is the one you'll want to take your kids to see.",5,When Walt Disney's irresistible force met P.L.

Tom Hanks was wonderful as Walt Disney, I thought I was a kid again welcoming Walt Disney into my home with another wonderful story.  Back in the 60's Walt Disney was the favorite of children and adults alike, and Hanks brought his A+ game to filling those shoes.  Emma Thompson as always is greater than life.  Nobody knew much of P.L. Travers but it does appear that Ms Thompson has captured the character and gave a great portrayal.  When you put Hanks and Thompson together, the whole is definitely greater than the sum of its parts.  The scene between Disney, (Hanks) and Mrs. Travers, (Thompson) where Walt Disney finally convinces Mrs. Travers to grant him the rights to make Mary Poppins is classic by itself.

And, as happens so often, it ends in a compromise of sorts, the kind where not everyone gets everything they want.I have to wonder, though, about the historical accuracy of Disney's struggle for movie rights as told by a Disney studio. One is left to speculate how it might have looked it told from the Travers side. Although I might have rservations about the series of events as a whole, a few points seem to have uncommon authenticity.

Being young, I obviously couldn't articulate exactly WHY I liked it so much (I'm sure the catchy music had a lot to do with it), but I wore a tract in the VCR with it, that is for sure.  After seeing &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34;, however, I was astounding to realize perhaps part of the reason why &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; stands the test of time: because the message behind it is one born out of real-life issues.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; focuses on P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), writer of the &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; children's novel.  For 20 years, Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) has been pursuing the rights to make the book into a movie, finally culminating in him flying Travers to Los Angeles to begin work on the project.  When Travers wants full creative control and clashes monumentally with Disney's version of the film, it is revealed (via flashbacks) how personal the Poppins story truly is to Travers.The reason why this movie is so touching and genuine is because it works on two different levels:On one hand, it brings back incredible nostalgia for fans of Disney's &#34;Mary Poppins&#34;.  Just hearing the iconic music again and seeing how key plot/character points came together is exciting.On the other hand, those (though probably few and far between) who haven't seen the movie will still be intrigued by the fascinating backstory of P.L. Travers.  More specifically, the role her father (played by Colin Farrell) played in her life and how that relationship shaped her persona even into adulthood.  Some fascinating human dynamics that prove out the old &#34;truth is stranger than fiction&#34; maxim.The hallmark of &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34;, though, is its ability to have audiences laughing, crying, singing, and feeling all in the span of two hours.  The complex characters, catchy tunes, and use of flashbacks prove a potent mixture of drama and fun.  This is truly a film for the entire family.Until recently, &#34;Prisoners&#34; had been cemented atop my &#34;Best Movie of 2013&#34; list.  &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34;, however, is just as good, if only in a completely different way.

I know it's popular because of the big named cast , but look past that and you'll see its garbage .",1,More overrated film garbage,1396396800,"04 2, 2014",2014,333,"['nothing', 'like', 'here', 'just', 'predictable', 'movie', 'decent', 'script', 'one', 'would', 'act', 'main', 'character', 'added', 'give', 'movie', 'sentimental', 'feel', 'Disney', 'so', 'no', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'surprised', 'know', 'popular', 'big', 'named', 'cast', 'look', ""'ll"", 'see', 'garbage']",Saving Mr. Banks

So first i like the story of Saving Mr. Banks.Both Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson are really worth watching in anything but this movie was really enjoyable because it brought back memories of much loved Mary Poppins and Disneyland. I like the back story of Walt Disney as well as P.L. Travers.Anytime a movie can take you on a magical ride that inlcudes remembering your own childhood is worth the &#34;E&#34; ticket.,3,Sometimes sad beginnings bring about amazing imagination,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,618,"['Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks', 'never', 'surprise', 'human', 'beings', 'have', 'ability', 'power', 'take', 'harsh', 'realities', 'young', 'life', 'create', 'something', 'as', 'magical', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'first', 'i', 'story', 'Saving', 'Mr.', 'Banks.Both', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'are', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'anything', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'brought', 'back', 'memories', 'much', 'loved', 'Mary', 'Poppins', 'Disneyland', 'back', 'story', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'as', 'well', 'P.L', 'Travers.Anytime', 'movie', 'can', 'take', 'magical', 'ride', 'remembering', 'own', 'childhood', '34', 'E', '34', 'ticket']",Saving Mr. Banks
