Newhart was hysterical without having to use an off-color word or having to resort to a sexual escapade to gain interest.

1678262,A1PS4EZLXYMNPF,B00GHH9HW2,"BRADLEY R HUTSON ""hutsman""","[6, 9]","As other reviewers have said, the audio and video quality of this season is definitely lacking.  That is a disappointment for certain, but it's nothing I couldn't live with.  No, the REAL deal-breaker for me was when I realized that at least two of the episodes in the set (""Kirk Ties One On"" and ""Leave it to the Beavers"") appear to be syndicated versions.  I could tell when I was watching them that they seemed to have some abrupt scene changes, and the running time (just over 22 minutes) was definitely too short since these episodes are supposed to clock in just over 24 minutes.  So, I went online and found the original full-length CBS versions of those two episodes (with the correct two-minute longer running time) on Youtube.I'm not going to hurl any mud at Shout! Factory for this, however.  After all, they could only provide us with what the publisher provided to them.  At first I didn't quite get the message that appears when you first play each disc that reads ""The following episodes were mastered from the best available video sources.""  Now I understand that basically means ""This is the best we can give you, since the publisher provided us with junk.""  At least they were willing to resume releasing ""Newhart"" on DVD, since it had become painfully obvious that 20th Century Fox had no intention of releasing any more seasons.  I only wish that the quality had been better, and that EACH episode had been the original CBS version.  The packaging is a bit misleading, since it says on the back cover the set contains ""All 22 original episodes.""  I take ""original"" to mean just that, the ORIGINAL full-length versions.The final verdict, for me anyway, is to not buy any more season sets of ""Newhart"" going forward.  I will just watch the rest of them that get released from rental sources.  That way I can see the shows again, but at a tiny fraction of the cost.  Since I'm only interested in owning original versions, why pay for these sets if there is going to be some edited episodes slipped in?  If I had known this going in, I would not have bought season two.

Everything that has been stated about this release is true.  Poor video quality transfer is true; but is not even the worst of this Shout Factory production.  They have edited episodes on the set.  As in episodes released for syndication.  Thus on Disc 3: &#34;Kirk Ties One On&#34;, 3-4 minutes are deleted from the original broadcast.  You can check it on Youtube.  The first segment of the episode is exactly the same.  The second segment when Larry, Daryl and Daryl enter, is hacked to pieces.  Even the part when Dick Loudon is tying Kirk's tie, that is cut.  Absolutely a Grade D product.  Shout Factory even employs prevarication to excuse and confuse what you are viewing.  At the beginning of the episode, they state &#34;this episode is made from the best available copy&#34; or words to that effect.  In other words: &#34;this is the best we had, so we transferred it to dvd&#34;One has to wonder why they use syndicated episodes for some and complete episodes for others.  DVD promised clean, crisp releases of the shows we have enjoyed over the years; and the movies as well.  What has been delivered is poor quality transfers on a cheap format for maximum profits--(at least in some cases).  This is a primary example of defrauding the customer for a quick buck.Unless you are willing to accept edited episodes and blurry pictures, do not buy this set!I can only imagine what Season 3 shall be like.

This wasn't the best season Newhart had, there were a lot of transitions in season two.  For one the Kirk character was very much the lost character and it seemed that the writers just didn't know what to do with him until the end of the season when they had him get married.  You see the real emergence of the Larry, Darrell and my other brother Darrell through the season.  And then there is Stephanie who was always one of my least favorite characters.  But on top of it all you have the genius of Bob Newhart, the chemestry between Bob and Mary Frann was great, and of course Tom Poston as George was amazing.

Not only is this disc at last here but everything about it is right. There is a &#8220;play all&#8221; function and where some of us like to have a looped sound sequence at the main menu to keep our players from turning off, some of us detest it (after nine hours, the suicide provoking theme to &#8220;Two and a Half Men&#8221; makes us want to jail Chuck Lorre) what they have here is a clip of one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written for television and we can listen to Henry Mancini a lot longer than a warmed over Monty Python bit that never leaves the I chord. But know that this loop is here.  Each disc contains about 7 to 8 episodes and though they were digitized from old masters, the quality is fairly good. The makeup and sweaters are going to make some of us feel old, but the writing and performances are as fresh as ever and we wish more than anything that today&#8217;s sit coms were a fraction of what this was. But most of all there is the triumph that at last, this disc is here. We hope that the subsequent 6 seasons do not take as long as this one to come out.(The series ran from 1982-1990)Bob Newhart has had a spectacular career. Point of fact, he&#8217;s had four or five spectacular careers. In the 50&#8217;s he was one of the top Comedians in the country, holding his own beside Mort Saul, Shelley Berman, Jonathan Winters Phyllis Diller and Lenny Bruce. In the 1960&#8217;s came the first &#8220;Bob Newhart Show&#8217; on CBS. He continued his motion picture career throughout, always in memorable character roles, even as recently as last season. In 1973 MTM launched the second &#8220;Bob Newhart Show&#8221; in which Bob and Emily lived in Chicago and his sitcom not only held in the top five but helped to define television history. Bob closed up his psychiatric practice while, as he put it, &#8220;We were at the top.&#8221; Four years later he was back as Dick Loudon with his wife, Joanna and this time the formula set them in a Vermont Inn. Everything here is pure brilliance and the last fifteen seconds of this series is, without question, one of the most brilliant finales in television history.&#8220;Newhart&#8221; traded between number one and three with &#8220;Cosby&#8221; and &#8220;Golden Girls&#8221; throughout the 80&#8217;s and helped define American Television. From that series came some American slang and coinage that remains viable today.&#8220;Hi.  I&#8217;m Larry; this is my brother Daryl. This is my other brother Daryl.&#8221;I won&#8217;t go into his subsequent series, &#8220;Bob&#8221; in which he played a comic book artist; we&#8217;re going to stay in Vermont.&#8220;Newhart&#8221; is an outstanding sitcom and Bob Newhart had the formula down. He is the sane man, connected to reality and the real world and is surrounded by insane characters. He fully utilizes his trademark telephone bits that made him a star of the stand-up stage in the 50.s. The first season of &#8220;Newhart&#8221; is excellent- and the weakest of the entire series. The second season- for which we waited more than ten years (more on that later) The producers began to tighten things up with the hiring of a new maid, Stephanie (Julia Duffy), the spoiled socialite who ended her marriage to an octogenarian and settled on &#8220;cleaning toilets for these people&#8221; instead of returning to the mansion that is home in Newport, Rhode Island and being Daddy&#8217;s little billionaire girl. Stephanie is the cousin of Leslie Vanderkelen who was the maid at the Stratford Inn in season one, far too sane and far too much like Joanna to balance the series, Leslie has gone on to Oxford for the next part of her education. Some of the set issues from season one are resolved. The balcony above the front door actually LEADS to a hallway, though the hallway at the top of the stairs still sends people into an open area that must hang out over the driveway. The uncomfortable colonial furniture in season one is replaced with upholstered, tasteful furniture arranged into reasonable conversation areas for a lobby and perfect for playing various scenes.The townspeople, particularly the Wannamakers become more regular and we get a wonderful deeper glimpse into the inner workings of this fictional town- though the opening credits show footage of Middlebury, Vermont and the town is in closer approximation to Dartmouth University than Bennington, so we know we&#8217;re in Southeast Vermont. We join the village at their pot luck dinners where Joanna takes a stand for the suffrage movement and brings the women out of the kitchen to eat with the men. Joanna again becomes involved in the local community theatre only to discover that they do the same play every year: &#8220;My Fair Lady Without The Music.&#8221; (&#8220;It flies right by!&#8221; said Mr. Wannamaker.) Even though Mary Frann, as Joanna, brings intelligence and, for the 80&#8217;s women&#8217;s rights, her desire to do good and to do it well brings about as much insanity as Larry, Daryl and Daryl. Stephanie, after a fit for a broken date, runs out in a snow storm and we have a three bears episode where she meets Larry Daryl and Daryl. Tom Poston- one of the most gifted character actors in history, continues to bring depth and love to the character off George Utley. Steven Kampmann as Kirk from the Minuteman caf&eacute; is here- at least for a while- and is the same, funny, shallow, vane and selfish, but it is clear why he was not picked up and replaced with Peter Scolari, given the need to follow the solid formula of insanity to fit with the very impressive presence of Julia Duffy. We get to meet Scolari and we see Dick become the host of his own television talk show (a classic episode) and in fact as the season wears on Kirk does indeed grow weary. We are reminded of how, beneath her vanity and attitude during the decade that made blonde jokes acceptable (thankfully for only a decade) Julia Duffy&#8217;s portrayal of Stephanie has class and kindness. This is a brilliant sitcom; it is easily in the top ten off best of all time and everything about this much awaited disc set is perfect.And so one final note. We waited for this disc for over a decade. We wore out three copies of season one while trying to track down who would admit to owning the rights to MTM&#8217;s catalog (even Mary Tyler Moore claimed not to know) and as more years passed and more messages went up on the internet asking &#8220;Why?

This is a GREAT show that was popular HOW long ago?  Long before the idea of releasing a series to the public after it aired was thought up.  Long before DVDs were out!  No wonder companies don't want to spend the money restoring these archived gems to put on DVD!!!  People knock the show because the technology back then cannot possibly compare to today.  People grousing about this nonsense is going to keep great archived shows archived.  Shows like Empty Nest, The Nanny and The Proffessor, The John Larroquette Show, Sonny Spoon and I bet you can think of a few more you would like to see from the not so distant past.  But it's not going to happen if people don't buy these because other people are knocking it for its technology.
