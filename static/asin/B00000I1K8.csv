501719,A3F270SNP9ZA8B,B00000I1K8,albertatamazon,"[117, 119]","This edition of the famous Mary Martin ""Peter Pan"" is not the very first 1955 telecast. That telecast is preserved on kinescope, not videotape, and most likely exists only in black and white, as kinescopes were unable to reproduce color.Instead, this is the 1960 production of that same musical, here preserved in color, and those who are expecting a ""different"" production need not worry. Most of the original Broadway cast is still here--the exceptions are the children, who naturally have been cast to replace the 1955 kids who of course had outgrown their roles. Wendy and Jane in this production are played by Maureen Bailey, who, although having an attractive singing voice, is a shrill actress who quickly gets on one's nerves (unlike Kathleen Nolan, who went on to have a successful career on television after ""Peter Pan""). Liza the maid is played not by Mary Martin's daughter Heller Halliday, but by Jacqueline Mayro.But practically everything else is the same as the 1955 production, and those who think that they have grown up watching that 1955 production are mistaken; it is this 1960 production which has been rerun over and over on television and issued on video. Yes, the sets look cheesy in comparison to what we would see today, and you can see the wires when the actors fly, but you will most likely never see a better, more heartfelt production of ""Peter Pan"" than this version. It is the only one which truly captures the spirit, humor and poignancy of the story, unlike the chintzy, superficial Cathy Rigby production. Mary Martin as Peter, Cyril Ritchard as Mr. Darling and Captain Hook, and Joe E. Marks as Smee have never been bettered by any other actors playing these roles.",4,Don't expect the 1955 kinescope,1011657600,"01 22, 2002",2002,1702,"['edition', 'famous', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'not', 'very', 'first', '1955', 'telecast', 'telecast', 'preserved', 'kinescope', 'not', 'videotape', 'most', 'likely', 'only', 'black', 'white', 'kinescopes', 'were', 'unable', 'reproduce', 'color.Instead', '1960', 'production', 'same', 'musical', 'here', 'preserved', 'color', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'different', 'production', 'need', 'not', 'worry', 'Most', 'original', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'still', 'here', 'exceptions', 'are', 'children', 'who', 'naturally', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'replace', '1955', 'kids', 'who', 'course', 'had', 'outgrown', 'roles', 'Wendy', 'Jane', 'production', 'are', 'played', 'Maureen', 'Bailey', 'who', 'having', 'attractive', 'singing', 'voice', 'shrill', 'actress', 'who', 'quickly', 'one', 'nerves', 'Kathleen', 'Nolan', 'who', 'went', 'have', 'successful', 'career', 'television', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Liza', 'maid', 'played', 'not', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'daughter', 'Heller', 'Halliday', 'Jacqueline', 'Mayro.But', 'practically', 'everything', 'else', 'same', '1955', 'production', 'who', 'think', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'watching', '1955', 'production', 'are', 'mistaken', '1960', 'production', 'been', 'rerun', 'television', 'issued', 'video', 'Yes', 'sets', 'look', 'cheesy', 'comparison', 'what', 'would', 'see', 'today', 'can', 'see', 'wires', 'when', 'actors', 'fly', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'never', 'see', 'better', 'more', 'heartfelt', 'production', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'version', 'only', 'one', 'truly', 'spirit', 'humor', 'poignancy', 'story', 'chintzy', 'superficial', 'Cathy', 'Rigby', 'production', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'Peter', 'Cyril', 'Ritchard', 'Mr', 'Darling', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Joe', 'E.', 'Marks', 'Smee', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'bettered', 'other', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles']",N/A
501720,A3964W4LM4K0SR,B00000I1K8,"Amazon Customer ""jkrayner""","[1, 2]","When I was 5 years old, my mother took me to Broadway to see Mary Martin in Peter Pan.  We even had box seats.  From that day on Mary Martin was my idol.  I was delighted when she redid the show for tv with Cyril Richard.  I own the VHS tape and would love to have a dvd of it, but with the prices being charged by scalping third party sellers on Amazon, it is cheaper to buy the vhs to dvd conversion equipment and software that are now being sold by Roxio and Nero (Ulead).  I never liked the Disney cartoon of this story and have hated any attempt at redoing it on stage (or tv) since Mary Martin.  Maybe I instinctively felt, even at a young age, that it was great that a woman was playing a boy's part - and ""boy"" could she play it.  There is actually great pathos when everyone leaves him, and I remember when I was young clapping as hard as I could to keep tinkerbell alive.  Disney has co-opted tinkerbell (you should see all the Disney products with her on it), but has done little to promote Peter himself.  Years later, I showed it to my 2 year old god-daughter and she loved it, but I think she has forgotten it by now (with Justin Bieber, etc. taking over her musical tastes).  However, I have noticed that the movies and books I shared with her as a young child remain in some way in her subconscious, and I hope that she will pass them on to her children.  The schools are now teach terribly politically correct stories and seem to have forgotten that part of their job is to keep our own culture going.  I don't mind new additions, but not at the expense of the old standards.  However, beware, the age of the classics we enjoyed as children is now much younger for today's children.  Even Elmo (who is 3 and meant for 3 year olds) is now relegated to 2 year olds.  So I recommend this to all of us who saw it in our childhood and to anyone with a child or grandchild who is 2 or 3 years old.",5,The Best Peter Pan Ever - Keep Our Culture Alive,1297987200,"02 18, 2011",2011,1908,"['When', 'was', '5', 'years', 'old', 'mother', 'took', 'Broadway', 'see', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'even', 'had', 'box', 'seats', 'day', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'was', 'idol', 'was', 'delighted', 'when', 'redid', 'show', 'tv', 'Cyril', 'Richard', 'own', 'VHS', 'tape', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'dvd', 'prices', 'being', 'charged', 'scalping', 'third', 'party', 'sellers', 'Amazon', 'cheaper', 'buy', 'vhs', 'dvd', 'conversion', 'equipment', 'software', 'are', 'now', 'being', 'sold', 'Roxio', 'Nero', 'Ulead', 'never', 'liked', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'story', 'have', 'hated', 'attempt', 'redoing', 'stage', 'tv', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'Maybe', 'instinctively', 'felt', 'even', 'young', 'age', 'was', 'great', 'woman', 'was', 'playing', 'boy', 'part', 'boy', 'could', 'play', 'actually', 'great', 'pathos', 'when', 'everyone', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'clapping', 'as', 'hard', 'could', 'keep', 'tinkerbell', 'alive', 'Disney', 'co-opted', 'tinkerbell', 'should', 'see', 'Disney', 'products', 'done', 'little', 'promote', 'Peter', 'Years', 'later', 'showed', '2', 'year', 'old', 'god-daughter', 'loved', 'think', 'forgotten', 'now', 'Justin', 'Bieber', 'etc', 'taking', 'over', 'musical', 'tastes', 'However', 'have', 'noticed', 'movies', 'books', 'shared', 'young', 'child', 'remain', 'way', 'subconscious', 'hope', 'will', 'pass', 'children', 'schools', 'are', 'now', 'teach', 'terribly', 'politically', 'correct', 'stories', 'seem', 'have', 'forgotten', 'part', 'job', 'keep', 'own', 'culture', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'new', 'additions', 'not', 'expense', 'old', 'standards', 'However', 'beware', 'age', 'classics', 'enjoyed', 'children', 'now', 'much', 'younger', 'today', 'children', 'Even', 'Elmo', 'who', '3', 'meant', '3', 'year', 'olds', 'now', 'relegated', '2', 'year', 'olds', 'So', 'recommend', 'who', 'saw', 'childhood', 'anyone', 'child', 'grandchild', 'who', '2', '3', 'years', 'old']",N/A

If parts of the Mary Martin production look a bit outdated, that's because this DVD is a re-mastering of a 40+ year-old videotape, and color videotape was fairly new in 1960 (it was only in its 3rd year, following pioneering specials with both Dinah Shore and Fred Astaire). The other reason for its static look is that the production was recorded *live,* without stopping for better or additional takes; what they saw in 1960 is what you got. This is the same way it was presented in 1955 and 1956 when it was a one-time live broadcast. And while the DVD includes the NBC title cards, it does not, sadly, include the logo of the animated NBC peacock.

501734,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B00000I1K8,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[1, 5]","SPOILERS FOLLOWMary Martin and Cyril Ritchard give admirable performances as, respectively, Peter Pan and Captain Hook in this film of the famous stage show.  Though this adaptation does show its cracks fifty years in, it still holds its own as nostalgic entertainment.There are two songs in particular I remember from seeing this rerun on television during the 1980's.  These are ""I'm Flying,"" which is, predictably, the song played during Peter's initial flight to Neverland with Wendy, Michael and John and ""Captain Hook,"" sung by Hook and his pirate gang to extol the Captain's status as the leader of the pirates.  Amazingly, I can still plainly remember the laughable line from this song ""...Mrs. Hook's little baby boy...""  I suppose the creative team was trying to get a laugh out of young children who might otherwise have been scared by the villain.  This is, actually, a more durable song overall than the repetitive and obvious ""I'm Flying.""There are limitations to the set work in this production.  Adapted from a play, the sets often look only vaguely better than the quality of sets one would expect to find in a high school production.  Additionally, the politics and norms of 1960 are very much in evidence, as the Native American girl Tiger Lily is played by a lily-white blonde actress.  Lastly, even though Mary Martin gives a bravura performance, I have always associated Peter Pan as being played by a male actor.  While Ms. Martin is nominally playing a male character, I cannot make the mental leap to say that she IS A MALE, and as an actor that is what she is trying to sell the audience on in this role.  I don't want to get too deep into gender politics, but J.M. Barrie did create a male title character.  Although he didn't actually appear live onscreen, Bobby Driscoll's vocal work in Disney's animated variation on ""Peter Pan"" also serves as an indelible reminder that the character is, in fact, male.While this production will always be an item of nostalgia for baby boomers and even to a much smaller degree their offspring, I predict it will lose more appeal than it will gain as time goes on and even newer generations are born.",3,"Entertaining and refreshingly family-friendly, but still dated and inferior",1265760000,"02 10, 2010",2010,2164,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWMary', 'Martin', 'Cyril', 'Ritchard', 'give', 'admirable', 'performances', 'respectively', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'film', 'famous', 'stage', 'show', 'adaptation', 'show', 'cracks', 'fifty', 'years', 'still', 'own', 'nostalgic', 'are', 'two', 'songs', 'particular', 'remember', 'seeing', 'rerun', 'television', '1980', 'are', ""'m"", 'Flying', 'predictably', 'song', 'played', 'Peter', 'initial', 'flight', 'Neverland', 'Wendy', 'Michael', 'John', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'sung', 'Hook', 'pirate', 'gang', 'extol', 'Captain', 'status', 'leader', 'pirates', 'Amazingly', 'can', 'still', 'plainly', 'remember', 'laughable', 'line', 'song', 'Mrs.', 'Hook', 'little', 'baby', 'boy', 'suppose', 'creative', 'team', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'laugh', 'young', 'children', 'who', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'scared', 'villain', 'actually', 'more', 'durable', 'song', 'overall', 'repetitive', 'obvious', ""'m"", 'Flying', 'are', 'limitations', 'set', 'work', 'production', 'Adapted', 'play', 'sets', 'often', 'look', 'only', 'vaguely', 'better', 'quality', 'sets', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'find', 'high', 'school', 'production', 'Additionally', 'politics', 'norms', '1960', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'evidence', 'Native', 'American', 'girl', 'Tiger', 'Lily', 'played', 'lily-white', 'blonde', 'actress', 'Lastly', 'even', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'bravura', 'performance', 'have', 'always', 'associated', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'being', 'played', 'male', 'actor', 'Ms.', 'Martin', 'nominally', 'playing', 'male', 'character', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'mental', 'leap', 'say', 'MALE', 'actor', 'what', 'trying', 'sell', 'audience', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'too', 'deep', 'gender', 'politics', 'J.M', 'Barrie', 'did', 'create', 'male', 'title', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'appear', 'live', 'onscreen', 'Bobby', 'Driscoll', 'vocal', 'work', 'Disney', 'animated', 'variation', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'also', 'indelible', 'reminder', 'character', 'fact', 'male.While', 'production', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'item', 'nostalgia', 'baby', 'boomers', 'even', 'much', 'smaller', 'degree', 'offspring', 'predict', 'will', 'lose', 'more', 'appeal', 'will', 'gain', 'time', 'even', 'newer', 'generations', 'are', 'born']",N/A

Barrie in the early 1900s, it was originally conceived and concocted for the entertainment of his young stepchildren.  Eventually Mr. Barrie ... a prolific British writer ... would develop it into a sucessful stage play.""Peter Pan"" ... as everyone knows ... is the story of ""The boy who wouldn't grow up.""  Peter lives in Never Land ... a far away fantasy island ... where companions (the lost boys), pirates, and indians serve to provide every day with exciting adventures.  Peter has the ability to fly ... thanks to fairy dust ... and he likes to travel to London, England ... to the home of the Darling family ... where, hidden from view, he observes their daily lives.  Peter longs to have three things the Darlings have, but he does not: stories, pockets, and a mother.  On one of these visits, Peter loses his shadow inside the Darling home, and so he is compelled to return a week later.  Then, while retrieving his shadow, he is discovered by the three Darling children (Wendy, John, and Michael) who are enthralled by this young visitor.  Peter teaches them how to fly and then leads the group ... which includes Tinkerbell ... a tiny fairy who is Peter's jealous companion ... on a flight to Never Land, where they all enjoy (and are emperiled by) many adventures.  In time, the Darling children become homesick and, to Peter's great sadness, they decide they want to return to London ... and to the loving embrace of their heartsick parents. (Peter does visit the Darling home again ... but much later on)""Peter Pan"" has a lot of what might be called ""timeless"" or ""universal"" story ideas, which would explain its continued appeal all these years.  This particular production was adapted from a successful Broadway play ... using the same principle performers ... for an NBC television broadcast.  First aired in 1955, it proved to be so popular that NBC re-staged, re-filmed, and re-aired it in 1956 and 1960.  This film is from the 1960 effort.Unlike earlier ""Peter Pan"" productions, this version was made to be a musical.  The songs ... with lyrics by Carolyn Leigh and music by Mark Charlap ... are delightful and memorable ... and all are sung live.  The dances ... choreographed by Jerome Robbins ... are original and imaginative ... and fun.The emphasis in this production ... I think it is worth noting ... is on satisfying the audience.  This may seem to be a basic precept in show business, but often shows allow themselves to be taken away from it.  Here everything is done 100% with the enjoyment of the audience in mind.Mary Martin stars as Peter, and she ""lights up"" like no other performer can.  A great singer and stage presence, she is never-the-less unselfish when it comes to sharing the spotlight with her fellow performers.  Cyril Ritchard plays Mr. Darling and Captain Hook and ... with all due respect to Mary Martin ... he is the most fun to watch here, and his performance retains its appeal the longest (after repeated viewings).  Maureen Bailey is Wendy, and she is a good solid Wendy who gives us a few adorable moments.  Sonra Lee plays Tiger Lily and she is adorable and lots of fun.But I think this is the best version of all the ""Peter Pan"" shows that have made it onto film.  It is an uncomplicated screen play that is rich in originality, creativeness, and charm.  It is a delight for children ... and those of us who wish that we didn't have to grow up (... cause growin' up is awfuller ... than all the awful things that ever were).",5,Excellent Entertainment,1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,3561,"['Peter', 'Pan', 'one', 'most', 'beloved', 'stories', 'time', 'Written', 'James', 'M.', 'Barrie', 'early', '1900s', 'was', 'originally', 'conceived', 'concocted', 'entertainment', 'young', 'stepchildren', 'Eventually', 'Mr.', 'Barrie', 'prolific', 'British', 'writer', 'would', 'develop', 'sucessful', 'stage', 'play', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'everyone', 'knows', 'story', 'boy', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'Peter', 'Never', 'Land', 'far', 'away', 'fantasy', 'island', 'where', 'companions', 'lost', 'boys', 'indians', 'serve', 'provide', 'day', 'exciting', 'adventures', 'Peter', 'ability', 'fly', 'thanks', 'fairy', 'dust', 'travel', 'London', 'England', 'home', 'Darling', 'family', 'where', 'hidden', 'view', 'daily', 'lives', 'Peter', 'longs', 'have', 'three', 'things', 'Darlings', 'have', 'not', 'stories', 'pockets', 'mother', 'one', 'visits', 'Peter', 'shadow', 'Darling', 'home', 'so', 'compelled', 'return', 'week', 'later', 'Then', 'retrieving', 'shadow', 'discovered', 'three', 'Darling', 'children', 'Wendy', 'John', 'Michael', 'who', 'are', 'enthralled', 'young', 'visitor', 'Peter', 'how', 'fly', 'then', 'group', 'Tinkerbell', 'tiny', 'fairy', 'who', 'Peter', 'jealous', 'companion', 'flight', 'Never', 'Land', 'where', 'enjoy', 'are', 'emperiled', 'many', 'adventures', 'time', 'Darling', 'children', 'become', 'homesick', 'Peter', 'great', 'sadness', 'decide', 'want', 'return', 'London', 'loving', 'embrace', 'heartsick', 'parents', 'Peter', 'visit', 'Darling', 'home', 'again', 'much', 'later', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'lot', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'called', 'timeless', 'universal', 'story', 'ideas', 'would', 'explain', 'continued', 'appeal', 'years', 'particular', 'production', 'was', 'adapted', 'successful', 'Broadway', 'play', 'using', 'same', 'principle', 'performers', 'NBC', 'television', 'broadcast', 'First', 'aired', '1955', 'proved', 'be', 'so', 'popular', 'NBC', 're-staged', 're-filmed', 're-aired', '1956', '1960', 'film', '1960', 'effort.Unlike', 'earlier', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'productions', 'version', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'musical', 'songs', 'lyrics', 'Carolyn', 'Leigh', 'music', 'Mark', 'Charlap', 'are', 'delightful', 'memorable', 'are', 'sung', 'live', 'dances', 'choreographed', 'Jerome', 'Robbins', 'are', 'original', 'imaginative', 'fun.The', 'emphasis', 'production', 'think', 'worth', 'noting', 'satisfying', 'audience', 'may', 'seem', 'be', 'basic', 'precept', 'show', 'business', 'often', 'allow', 'be', 'taken', 'away', 'Here', 'everything', 'done', '100', '%', 'enjoyment', 'audience', 'mind.Mary', 'Martin', 'stars', 'Peter', 'up', 'other', 'performer', 'can', 'great', 'singer', 'stage', 'presence', 'never-the-less', 'unselfish', 'when', 'sharing', 'spotlight', 'fellow', 'performers', 'Cyril', 'Ritchard', 'Mr', 'Darling', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'due', 'respect', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'most', 'fun', 'watch', 'here', 'performance', 'appeal', 'longest', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'Maureen', 'Bailey', 'Wendy', 'good', 'solid', 'Wendy', 'who', 'few', 'adorable', 'moments', 'Sonra', 'Lee', 'Tiger', 'Lily', 'adorable', 'lots', 'fun.But', 'think', 'best', 'version', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'uncomplicated', 'screen', 'play', 'rich', 'originality', 'creativeness', 'charm', 'delight', 'children', 'who', 'wish', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'grow', 'up', 'cause', 'growin', 'up', 'awfuller', 'awful', 'things', 'ever', 'were']",N/A

It was as a kid when I first saw this Broadway on Television Musical production of the timeless tale of the flying boy who refuses to grow up. Although I am a few years too young to have seen the original Live broadcast, I saw a later rebroadcast that left me with vague memories of a 40 something Mary Martin as Peter Pan, a huge furry (actor in a costume) sheep dog, pirates, indians and pieces of the tunes of &quot;I won't grow up&quot;, and &quot;Ugga Wugga&quot; floating pleasently through my head. It was rebroadcast for a more recent &quot;For the first time in 20 (or 30) years&quot; anniversary just before being relased onto VHS for the first time.I don't feel there is much need to go into the story for this one since most viewers would be at least familiar with the Di$ney animated version of this magical story. So I'll mention some of the cast: Peter Pan (Mary Martin), Captain Hook (Cyril Ritchard) the musically inclined leader of the Pirates, Wendy (Maureen Bailey), Tiger Lilly (Sondra Lee) the Indian cheif. A coulple of neat keeper features are the original NBC Credits voice-over and the (back from the commercial breaks) Act slides.This DVD is Fantastic, there is only some slightly noticible video glitching (in the final scene)which is very good coming from GoodTimes Home Video. Most of my budget VHS tapes from them are on the cheesey &quot;spit &amp; bubble gum&quot; side of quality. Considering it was mastered from the original Live broadcast, the video quality is incredible for a 40 year old television production. The audio track could use a little tweaking to get rid of the slight tin can sound, but is remarkably very good. The &quot;Clam Shell&quot; case (Yuck!) says it's in stereo... obviously it's remastered Mono to Stereo Stereo, since &quot;Stereo&quot; television didn't appear until sometime in the mid-eightys.. They also have a &quot;this film has been modified to fit your television screen&quot; message at the begining, WHY? It is from a Television Broadcast there should have been no reformating, oh well.The extras are very few:English and Spanish Captioned Subtitles 18 Still Photo Scene Index (numbered with hooks)and that's about it, Production Notes or Cast Bios might have been an interesting thing to add. I'm not sure if in 1960 they had &quot;Teaser&quot; promos for special shows or not, perhaps not for live events. Since the case is clam shelled there is no book with extra production notes or something thrilling like that.I give Peter Pan a 4 for picture and a 3 for sound.",4,Peter Pan: Over 40 and Still WON'T GROW UP!,993513600,"06 26, 2001",2001,2590,"['quot', 'Wo', ""n't"", 'Grow', 'Up', 'quot', 'Ah', 'be', 'kid', 'again', 'was', 'kid', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Broadway', 'Television', 'Musical', 'production', 'timeless', 'tale', 'flying', 'boy', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'am', 'few', 'years', 'too', 'young', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'Live', 'broadcast', 'saw', 'later', 'rebroadcast', 'left', 'vague', 'memories', '40', 'something', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'huge', 'furry', 'actor', 'costume', 'sheep', 'dog', 'pirates', 'indians', 'pieces', 'tunes', 'quot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'grow', 'up', 'quot', 'quot', 'Ugga', 'Wugga', 'quot', 'floating', 'pleasently', 'head', 'was', 'rebroadcast', 'more', 'recent', 'quot', 'first', 'time', '20', '30', 'years', 'quot', 'anniversary', 'just', 'being', 'relased', 'VHS', 'first', 'time.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'there', 'much', 'need', 'go', 'story', 'one', 'most', 'viewers', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'familiar', 'Di', 'ney', 'animated', 'version', 'magical', 'story', ""'ll"", 'mention', 'cast', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'Cyril', 'Ritchard', 'musically', 'inclined', 'leader', 'Pirates', 'Wendy', 'Maureen', 'Bailey', 'Tiger', 'Lilly', 'Sondra', 'Lee', 'Indian', 'cheif', 'coulple', 'neat', 'keeper', 'features', 'are', 'original', 'NBC', 'Credits', 'voice-over', 'back', 'commercial', 'breaks', 'Act', 'slides.This', 'DVD', 'Fantastic', 'only', 'slightly', 'noticible', 'video', 'glitching', 'final', 'scene', 'very', 'good', 'coming', 'GoodTimes', 'Home', 'Video', 'Most', 'budget', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'are', 'cheesey', 'quot', 'amp', 'bubble', 'gum', 'quot', 'side', 'quality', 'Considering', 'was', 'mastered', 'original', 'Live', 'broadcast', 'video', 'quality', 'incredible', '40', 'year', 'old', 'television', 'production', 'audio', 'track', 'could', 'use', 'little', 'tweaking', 'get', 'rid', 'slight', 'tin', 'can', 'sound', 'remarkably', 'very', 'good', 'quot', 'Clam', 'Shell', 'quot', 'case', 'Yuck', 'stereo', 'obviously', 'remastered', 'Mono', 'Stereo', 'Stereo', 'quot', 'Stereo', 'quot', 'television', 'did', ""n't"", 'appear', 'sometime', 'mid-eightys..', 'also', 'have', 'quot', 'film', 'been', 'modified', 'fit', 'television', 'screen', 'quot', 'message', 'begining', 'WHY', 'Television', 'Broadcast', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'reformating', 'oh', 'well.The', 'extras', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'English', 'Spanish', 'Captioned', 'Subtitles', '18', 'Still', 'Photo', 'Scene', 'Index', 'numbered', 'hooks', 'Production', 'Notes', 'Cast', 'Bios', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'thing', 'add', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', '1960', 'had', 'quot', 'Teaser', 'quot', 'promos', 'special', 'shows', 'not', 'perhaps', 'not', 'live', 'events', 'case', 'clam', 'shelled', 'book', 'extra', 'production', 'notes', 'something', 'thrilling', 'that.I', 'give', 'Peter', 'Pan', '4', 'picture', '3', 'sound']",N/A

501742,A3GLF9XK4AUAHS,B00000I1K8,Robert E. Nylund,"[7, 7]","Musical comedy star Mary Martin may have not been as well-known to many of us if she hadn't appeared in a television version of the famous ""Peter Pan"" story on March 7, 1955.  After achieving great success on Broadway, and limited success in Hollywood (in generally disappointing film roles), Martin joined Australian actor Cyril Ritchard in an outstanding adaptation of Sir James Barrie's classic tale of boys who would not grow up.All of the elements of the story were incorporated in the NBC compatible color telecast, including the use of a woman in playing Peter Pan.  Mary Martin was slender and cut her hair short; with the use of make-up, she was able to achieve the effect of portraying an adolescent boy who refuses to grow up.  Peter lives on an uncharted island with other boys who don't want to become adults.One of the amazing things about Peter, however, is that he has the ability to fly.  (The effect was done through the use of special wires.)  During one of his nighttime flights, he spies on a family in London and, eventually, persuades the children to come to his island.  This includes the daughter, Wendy, who becomes a virtual mother to the boys.  Soon, however, they are battling pirates and Indians.  Peter Pan has considerable imagination in dealing with the threats, but there are numerous dangers, particularly from the pirates led by the notorious Captain Hook (wonderfully portrayed by Cyril Ritchard, who also plays the father of the English children).Interwoven into this delightful adaptation are some memorable songs that became extremely popular.  The original live telecast was so popular that NBC telecast it again in compatible color on January 9, 1956.  Unfortunately, videotape was still being perfected and neither telecasts were taped.  Eventually, as videotape became more practical, NBC was able to reunite Martin and Ritchard for a color taping of the musical in 1960.Typical of early color telecasts, the color range is more limited than today's color, but it is still quite impressive and one can enjoy the fine performances by Martin and Ritchard and the top-notch supporting cast.  Yes, the sets are somewhat limited compared to today's television productions, but that is not a big factor in enjoying this production.It is wonderful that NBC was able to preserve one of the more enjoyable television productions from the ""golden age"" of early television.  This is a story, too, that can appeal to both children and adults and is a reminder of a more innocent time when spectacular effects, sex, and violence were not as important (or even allowed).",5,Mary Martin's Peter Pan,1146096000,"04 27, 2006",2006,2600,"['Musical', 'comedy', 'star', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'well-known', 'many', 'had', ""n't"", 'appeared', 'television', 'version', 'famous', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'story', 'March', '7', '1955', 'achieving', 'great', 'success', 'Broadway', 'limited', 'success', 'Hollywood', 'generally', 'disappointing', 'film', 'roles', 'Martin', 'joined', 'Australian', 'actor', 'Cyril', 'Ritchard', 'outstanding', 'adaptation', 'Sir', 'James', 'Barrie', 'classic', 'tale', 'boys', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'grow', 'up.All', 'elements', 'story', 'were', 'incorporated', 'NBC', 'compatible', 'color', 'telecast', 'including', 'use', 'woman', 'playing', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'was', 'slender', 'cut', 'hair', 'short', 'use', 'make-up', 'was', 'able', 'achieve', 'effect', 'portraying', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'who', 'grow', 'up', 'Peter', 'uncharted', 'island', 'other', 'boys', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'become', 'adults.One', 'amazing', 'things', 'Peter', 'however', 'ability', 'fly', 'effect', 'was', 'done', 'use', 'special', 'wires', 'one', 'nighttime', 'flights', 'family', 'London', 'eventually', 'children', 'come', 'island', 'daughter', 'Wendy', 'who', 'virtual', 'mother', 'boys', 'Soon', 'however', 'are', 'battling', 'pirates', 'Indians', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'considerable', 'imagination', 'dealing', 'threats', 'are', 'numerous', 'dangers', 'particularly', 'pirates', 'led', 'notorious', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'Cyril', 'Ritchard', 'who', 'also', 'father', 'English', 'children', '.Interwoven', 'delightful', 'adaptation', 'are', 'memorable', 'songs', 'became', 'extremely', 'popular', 'original', 'live', 'telecast', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'NBC', 'telecast', 'again', 'compatible', 'color', 'January', '9', '1956', 'Unfortunately', 'videotape', 'was', 'still', 'being', 'perfected', 'telecasts', 'were', 'taped', 'Eventually', 'videotape', 'became', 'more', 'practical', 'NBC', 'was', 'able', 'reunite', 'Martin', 'Ritchard', 'color', 'taping', 'musical', '1960.Typical', 'early', 'color', 'telecasts', 'color', 'range', 'more', 'limited', 'today', 'color', 'still', 'quite', 'impressive', 'one', 'can', 'enjoy', 'fine', 'performances', 'Martin', 'Ritchard', 'top-notch', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Yes', 'sets', 'are', 'somewhat', 'limited', 'compared', 'today', 'television', 'productions', 'not', 'big', 'factor', 'enjoying', 'production.It', 'wonderful', 'NBC', 'was', 'able', 'preserve', 'one', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'television', 'productions', 'golden', 'age', 'early', 'television', 'story', 'too', 'can', 'appeal', 'children', 'adults', 'reminder', 'more', 'innocent', 'time', 'when', 'spectacular', 'effects', 'sex', 'violence', 'were', 'not', 'important', 'even', 'allowed']",N/A

501745,A37NL9EDUT23IV,B00000I1K8,"takemehome ""Joey""","[6, 7]","Like many from my generation...and my parents' generation, I grew up with this classic TV production of Peter Pan. The cheap sets, shoddy special effects, and over-the-top acting didn't matter when I was seven, and they don't matter now. The production is still fun to watch, with its classic songs and Mary Martin's legendary performance.However, it's been several years since this movie's been in print in any format. I'm fortunate enough to own a bootleg DVD copied from a VHS tape, but whoever owns the rights to the video and DVD releases of Peter Pan needs to bring it back into print, digitally restored and remastered for optimal video and audio quality, with a few nice bonus materials. Not everyone knows someone who can get them a bootleg, nor does everyone have $100+ for a used copy, or the equiupment and knowledge required to make their own homemade DVD from their video copies. This classic NEEDS to be available to the masses. Maybe even in a 2-Disc set with the kinescope version of the 1957 broadcast on disc 2, making this a true Special Edition.If you can track down a copy for cheap or get your hands on a bootleg, go for it.

501746,A4JHEO7H330AF,B00000I1K8,Tom Brody,"[0, 0]","I understand that when Peter Pan was first performed on stage, a female played the title role. This was because of rules regarding child actors at that earlier time in history. I first saw Mary Martin on television in a production of Peter Pan, in a broadcast in the 1950s. I did not like it then. And I do not like it now. I do not think that females in movies for children should play parts that are supposed to be male role models unless, for course, it is for comedic effect. Yuck. Is there anything good that I can say about this product? YESSSSS! For parents interested in confusing their male child as to his gender identity, and interested in traumatizing the child, this movie will be a useful and integral component of any gender-confusion program. For a workable program of gender confusion, I suggest forcing the young boy to wear frilled skirts, pink-colored buckle sandals, salmon-colored lipstick with a tad of eyeliner, and forcing the boy to use expressions more often used by girls, such as, &#34;My pup is totally my best friend,&#34; or &#34;I am so stoked that Bella and Zendaya are reunited,&#34; or &#34;Ryan and I took a selfie, OMG!&#34;  Mary Martin's Peter Pan can be an integral and effective part of any parent's agenda of gender confusion.

This re-telling of the Pan story, set on stage with Mary Martin portraying the rambunctious youngster, has a certain charm that is all its own.Unlike some Pan stories that may take themselves a bit too seriously, this edition is made for children and it shows in nearly every scene.  Both Captain Hook and his merry band of pirates and the Tiger Lilly-led Indians are played for slapstick/silly humor, while Martin's Pan and Wendy are quite whimsical themselves.Yet, despite the child-oriented humor and content, adults can also enjoy the film for the exact same reasons.  Instead of playing like, say, a typical Disney film (where little tidbits are thrown in every once in awhile to keep parents moderately entertained) this production will charm adults on the sole premise of its youthful exuberance.Perhaps the highlight of the entire Pan experience, though, are the musical numbers (especially those featuring Cyril Ritchard's Hook).  The Indian numbers are particularly fun, while ""Hook's Tango"" is probably the highlight of the entire film.So, though older children may roll their eyes at the hokey plot/acting/humor, young kiddies will still revel in it again and again!",5,The Pan That Defined My Childhood,1241568000,"05 6, 2009",2009,1358,"['Ever', 'original', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'story', 'was', 'put', 'paper', 'adventures', 'Peter', 'Neverland', 'have', 'been', 'chronicled', 'various', 'different', 'formats', 'books', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'etc.', 're-telling', 'Pan', 'story', 'set', 'stage', 'Mary', 'Martin', 'portraying', 'rambunctious', 'youngster', 'certain', 'charm', 'Pan', 'stories', 'may', 'take', 'bit', 'too', 'seriously', 'edition', 'made', 'children', 'nearly', 'scene', 'Captain', 'Hook', 'merry', 'band', 'pirates', 'Tiger', 'Lilly-led', 'Indians', 'are', 'played', 'slapstick/silly', 'humor', 'Martin', 'Pan', 'Wendy', 'are', 'quite', 'whimsical', 'themselves.Yet', 'child-oriented', 'humor', 'content', 'adults', 'can', 'also', 'enjoy', 'film', 'exact', 'same', 'reasons', 'Instead', 'playing', 'say', 'typical', 'Disney', 'film', 'where', 'little', 'tidbits', 'are', 'thrown', 'once', 'awhile', 'keep', 'parents', 'moderately', 'entertained', 'production', 'will', 'charm', 'adults', 'sole', 'premise', 'youthful', 'exuberance.Perhaps', 'highlight', 'entire', 'Pan', 'experience', 'are', 'musical', 'numbers', 'especially', 'featuring', 'Cyril', 'Ritchard', 'Hook', 'Indian', 'numbers', 'are', 'particularly', 'fun', 'Hook', 'Tango', 'probably', 'highlight', 'entire', 'film.So', 'older', 'children', 'may', 'roll', 'eyes', 'hokey', 'plot/acting/humor', 'young', 'kiddies', 'will', 'still', 'revel', 'again', 'again']",N/A
