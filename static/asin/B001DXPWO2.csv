1183574,A3TTDEJRZ92ME1,B001DXPWO2,"Amanda T. Stouffer ""Sunshine""","[2, 2]","I love this movie. It is one of my favorite animes, despite not having the same elements that I loved so much in movies such as Howl's Moving Castle. However it does have the ""lessons learned"" theme that is put in a way that doesn't bore you or make you roll your eyes.Spectacular animation, beautifully made, wonderful music, and great concepts.This is one of the first times I have seen a movie and am eagerly jumping to buy/loan the book!I do feel it leaves you with some questions here and there, but it all seems to fit in line with the story, the themes and tones and such, and gives it a ""mysterious"" or ""sci-fi"" feel.I was genuinely surprised with the ending and enjoyed it thoroughly.This movie made me laugh quite a few times and get pretty sad at one point. It has it's light and serious points and is a fun idea of real life meeting fantasy (time travel technology and people from the future).Unlike movies such as My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, or the non-anime Coraline, this movie is not filled with things that will catch a younger child's attention.However, if you're looking for an interesing film to watch with friends or whoever, it's a good one to watch, enjoy, and talk about.",5,My new favorite anime - great for pre-teens to adults!,1269820800,"03 29, 2010",2010,1202,"['love', 'movie', 'one', 'favorite', 'animes', 'not', 'having', 'same', 'elements', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'movies', 'such', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'However', 'have', 'lessons', 'learned', 'theme', 'put', 'way', ""n't"", 'bore', 'make', 'roll', 'eyes.Spectacular', 'animation', 'beautifully', 'made', 'wonderful', 'music', 'great', 'concepts.This', 'one', 'first', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'am', 'eagerly', 'jumping', 'buy/loan', 'book', 'do', 'feel', 'questions', 'here', 'there', 'fit', 'line', 'story', 'themes', 'tones', 'such', 'mysterious', 'sci-fi', 'feel.I', 'was', 'genuinely', 'surprised', 'ending', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly.This', 'movie', 'made', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'get', 'pretty', 'sad', 'one', 'point', 'light', 'serious', 'points', 'fun', 'idea', 'real', 'life', 'meeting', 'fantasy', 'time', 'travel', 'technology', 'people', 'future', 'movies', 'such', 'My', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'non-anime', 'Coraline', 'movie', 'not', 'filled', 'things', 'will', 'catch', 'younger', 'child', 'attention.However', ""'re"", 'looking', 'interesing', 'film', 'watch', 'friends', 'whoever', 'good', 'one', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'talk']",N/A

1183579,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B001DXPWO2,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[4, 4]","Putting in my two cents:The Girl Who Leapt Through Time has been on my to-watch list for awhile, but I never took the time to check it out until yesterday.  I (like most of the other reviewers) wasn't expecting too much, but after viewing their newer film ""Summer Wars"" I decided to give it a go.  I have to say that despite being a slightly older film, this exceeds Summer Wars in almost every aspect (except maybe computer animation).There are literally no weaknesses in this film.  The animation quality remains high throughout.  The characters are beautifully hand drawn and the backgrounds painstakingly rendered (mostly hand drawn as well).  The use of computer animation is kept to a minimum and mainly occurs when we view a 'leap'.The characters are strong and likable.  Makoto is your typical clumsy teenager.  A chance encounter followed by a (nearly) horrific accident enable her to 'leap' through time.  Rather than use this ability for so called 'evil' (I would be leaping back and investing heavily in certain stocks...), Makoto uses the ability to make her life and the lives of her friends better.  However, this begins to cause unforeseen and dire circumstances.And this is about the point where the  movie shifts from lighthearted and somewhat comedic to fully dramatic and saddening.  I won't divulge any events or spoil any plots for you, but let's say that I was moved by the end of the film (though not quite teary eyed!).The Japanese voice acting is strong, especially considering at least 2/3 main characters are voiced by a first time voice actor.  It goes to show you how in Japan, they take the voice acting seriously and cast well (rather than the majority of American dubbing firms which have a core of 5 or 6 full time actors that they HAVE to match to a main character in each series or film - often not getting the best match to the character).So the story is strong with a little sci-fi edge, the characters are likable and well portrayed, the voice acting is wonderful, the animation is gorgeous... why haven't you seen this yet?  If you are not a fan of anime, this might be a good film to help change your mind.",5,Why Can't More Films Be Like This? ~,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,2147,"['Putting', 'two', 'cents', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Leapt', 'Through', 'Time', 'been', 'to-watch', 'list', 'awhile', 'never', 'took', 'time', 'check', 'out', 'yesterday', 'most', 'other', 'reviewers', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'viewing', 'newer', 'film', 'Summer', 'Wars', 'decided', 'give', 'go', 'have', 'say', 'being', 'slightly', 'older', 'film', 'Summer', 'Wars', 'almost', 'aspect', 'maybe', 'computer', 'animation', 'are', 'literally', 'weaknesses', 'film', 'animation', 'quality', 'high', 'characters', 'are', 'beautifully', 'hand', 'drawn', 'backgrounds', 'painstakingly', 'rendered', 'mostly', 'hand', 'drawn', 'well', 'use', 'computer', 'animation', 'kept', 'minimum', 'mainly', 'when', 'view', ""'leap'.The"", 'characters', 'are', 'strong', 'likable', 'Makoto', 'typical', 'clumsy', 'teenager', 'chance', 'encounter', 'followed', 'nearly', 'horrific', 'accident', 'enable', ""'leap"", 'time', 'Rather', 'use', 'ability', 'so', 'called', ""'evil"", 'would', 'be', 'leaping', 'back', 'investing', 'heavily', 'certain', 'stocks', 'Makoto', 'ability', 'make', 'life', 'lives', 'friends', 'better', 'However', 'cause', 'unforeseen', 'dire', 'circumstances.And', 'point', 'where', 'movie', 'shifts', 'lighthearted', 'somewhat', 'comedic', 'fully', 'dramatic', 'saddening', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'events', 'spoil', 'plots', 'let', 'say', 'was', 'moved', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'quite', 'teary', 'eyed', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'strong', 'especially', 'considering', 'least', '2/3', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'voiced', 'first', 'time', 'voice', 'actor', 'show', 'how', 'Japan', 'take', 'voice', 'acting', 'seriously', 'cast', 'well', 'rather', 'majority', 'American', 'dubbing', 'firms', 'have', 'core', '5', '6', 'full', 'time', 'actors', 'HAVE', 'match', 'main', 'character', 'series', 'film', 'often', 'not', 'getting', 'best', 'match', 'character', 'story', 'strong', 'little', 'sci-fi', 'edge', 'characters', 'are', 'likable', 'well', 'portrayed', 'voice', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'animation', 'gorgeous', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'anime', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'help', 'change', 'mind']",N/A

1183581,A216F4VHOTA9MJ,B001DXPWO2,Deafie,"[1, 1]","I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. I had really low expectations because it's a cartoon and the cover of the DVD made me think it's a movie for teens. I took a chance and watched it anyway because I love the scifi genre including time travel. The subtitles were fine. It's the first time I've ever seen an anime movie. As a result of seeing this movie, I'll definitely be more openminded about the possibility of seeing other anime movies in the future.I did see one strange scene in the movie. There's a scene where Aunt Witch is talking, and then the camera focuses on a picture in the background behind Aunt Witch showing Aunt Witch as a young girl surrounded on either side by apparently her parents. Because of how long the camera focused on this picture, I thought the picture might mean something in the overall context of the movie, but nothing ever happened elsewhere in the movie that related back to the information in this picture. The whole movie was terrific, but I'm still bothered by the missing point of this seemingly wasted scene. Aunt Witch says she has time travelled too in addition to Makoto, but this is never really explained further anywhere. Why does her story appear to somewhat parallel the story of Makoto?(There was another scene near the end that I didn't understand either, but that mystery was resolved by a comment made by another reviewer responding to yet another review, so now I understand better what happened in that other scene.)",5,"loved this movie, have question about one mystery scene",1267228800,"02 27, 2010",2010,1486,"['was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'had', 'really', 'low', 'expectations', 'cartoon', 'cover', 'DVD', 'made', 'think', 'movie', 'teens', 'took', 'chance', 'watched', 'anyway', 'love', 'scifi', 'genre', 'including', 'time', 'travel', 'subtitles', 'were', 'fine', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'anime', 'movie', 'result', 'seeing', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'be', 'more', 'openminded', 'possibility', 'seeing', 'other', 'anime', 'movies', 'future.I', 'did', 'see', 'one', 'strange', 'scene', 'movie', 'scene', 'where', 'Aunt', 'Witch', 'talking', 'then', 'camera', 'picture', 'background', 'Aunt', 'Witch', 'showing', 'Aunt', 'Witch', 'young', 'girl', 'surrounded', 'side', 'apparently', 'parents', 'how', 'long', 'camera', 'focused', 'picture', 'thought', 'picture', 'might', 'mean', 'something', 'overall', 'context', 'movie', 'nothing', 'ever', 'happened', 'elsewhere', 'movie', 'related', 'back', 'information', 'picture', 'whole', 'movie', 'was', 'terrific', ""'m"", 'still', 'bothered', 'missing', 'point', 'seemingly', 'wasted', 'scene', 'Aunt', 'Witch', 'time', 'travelled', 'too', 'addition', 'Makoto', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'further', 'anywhere', 'Why', 'story', 'appear', 'somewhat', 'parallel', 'story', 'Makoto', 'was', 'scene', 'end', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'either', 'mystery', 'was', 'resolved', 'comment', 'made', 'reviewer', 'responding', 'yet', 'review', 'so', 'now', 'understand', 'better', 'what', 'happened', 'other', 'scene']",N/A

On watching I started to think 'this is going to be awful' when the heroine Makoto did her first face gurning over exaggeration. It reminded me of some really terrible cartoons my daughter used to watch. Luckily the gurning only reappeared occasionally in this story.The voices and soundtrack are really good. You forget it wasn't originally English. The haunting piano music also stood out. Some of the settings and skyscapes are stunning and the leaping through time images were original and great to watch. The 'drawn' characters stopped me from ever believing this was a real story but I still enjoyed it.This film is great fun. The leaping through time always ends with a comic thump back to earth or 'is anyone dead yet?'. You don't know what is going to happen next. The story also develops well and takes an unexpected turn into a sci fi love story. I think because of the themes the 12+ rating is about right.I would describe this film as a cross between 'Groundhog Day' and 'Back to the Future' both very likeable, easily accessible films and this film is too. The story revolves around a highschool, a baseball field, an art gallery, Makoto's home and the road to school. It is quite a limited claustrophic setting but it works well and builds up the story tension as different things happen on ordinary days with Makoto's intervention. Some of it is life and death and some of it high school angst and some is pure pudding humour.I think teenage girls would especially like the teen romance storyline. I think this would definitely be a teen 'date movie'.Highly recommended.",5,Spine Tinglingly Good,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,1704,"['will', 'admit', 'knowing', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Manga', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'easy', 'going', 'cartoon', 'watching', 'started', 'think', ""'this"", 'going', 'be', 'awful', 'when', 'heroine', 'Makoto', 'did', 'first', 'face', 'gurning', 'exaggeration', 'reminded', 'really', 'terrible', 'cartoons', 'daughter', 'used', 'watch', 'Luckily', 'gurning', 'only', 'reappeared', 'occasionally', 'story.The', 'voices', 'soundtrack', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'forget', 'was', ""n't"", 'originally', 'English', 'haunting', 'piano', 'music', 'also', 'stood', 'out', 'settings', 'skyscapes', 'are', 'stunning', 'leaping', 'time', 'images', 'were', 'original', 'great', 'watch', ""'drawn"", 'characters', 'stopped', 'ever', 'believing', 'was', 'real', 'story', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'it.This', 'film', 'great', 'fun', 'leaping', 'time', 'always', 'comic', 'thump', 'back', 'earth', ""'is"", 'anyone', 'dead', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next', 'story', 'also', 'well', 'unexpected', 'turn', 'sci', 'fi', 'love', 'story', 'think', 'themes', '12+', 'rating', 'right.I', 'would', 'describe', 'film', 'cross', ""'Groundhog"", 'Day', ""'Back"", 'Future', 'very', 'likeable', 'easily', 'accessible', 'films', 'film', 'too', 'story', 'around', 'highschool', 'baseball', 'field', 'art', 'gallery', 'Makoto', 'home', 'road', 'school', 'quite', 'limited', 'claustrophic', 'setting', 'well', 'up', 'story', 'tension', 'different', 'things', 'happen', 'ordinary', 'days', 'Makoto', 'intervention', 'life', 'death', 'high', 'school', 'angst', 'pure', 'pudding', 'humour.I', 'think', 'teenage', 'girls', 'would', 'especially', 'teen', 'romance', 'storyline', 'think', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'teen', ""'date"", ""movie'.Highly"", 'recommended']",N/A

The great supernatrual element but still grounded in real life makes this movie.  It dosen't get stuck with the time travel it is used as a plot element.  The main girl starts off as a teenager with a normal life and two good friends.  And turns out to be a little full of herself but then you find her soft side.  Her friends are good charecters as well not imperitive at the start but near the end... I won't ruin it.Not for the action fan but great for an anime fan.  Think a Spririted Away without the monsters and spirits.  The down to earth with the small amount of supernatrual element makes a beautiful movie.

This one is a classic storyline that's been done many times in various forms in Japan and that region of Asia, but this is the best perhaps because it is so simple in execution.One aspect I found interesting, if you have some idea of what's coming in the next few years (supernova/binary star passing/comet cluster/ realm border to 4d and all the earth changes in the EM field leading to the next ice age as the volcanoes, EQs etc go off), is that the male time traveler mentions near the end about how crowded it is at that intersection etc. Imagine the situation after the Day After Tomorrow if you went back in time and found a crowded world where in your own timeline, there simply weren't many that survived.

1183598,A3F9VH8916IA40,B001DXPWO2,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[1, 1]","Every bone in my body is telling me ""Jonathan, this is a romance, it's a time traveling romance filled with plot holes, love triangles, and more teenee gooy romance then you can handle."" Yes, it's true; I've made somewhat of a reputation for myself amongst my family and friends for my hatred of these kinds of movies. You know, close nit group of friends (two guys, one girl), boy likes girl but doesn't have the guts to tell her for fear of ruining their friendship, girl likes guy but doesn't want to admit it, other guy likes girl but doesn't want relationship getting in the way of school, girl develops time traveling super powers, drama ensues. You know, your basic stuff.  If this were ANY other movie, made by any other director, done any differently than it was, I'd probably have a field day ripping this film a new one. And why not? Didn't I rip Myazaki's ""Whisper of the Heart"" for the same elements this movie has? Yes, I seem to remember doing that, and having good reasons for it too. It wasn't a fluke, I'm not in the habit of giving out bad reviews for Studio Ghibli's amazing (and I do mean amazing) work, much less a film Myazaki himself, the MASTER of anime, produced. But I did, and I stand by that decision.But how then can I sit here with a straight face and tell you that The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a magnificent film. Not just a good film, but one of my favorite anime movies of all time that managed to bring a smile to the face of even a sarcastic cynic like me. Even with all its mellow drama, its plot holes, the love triangles and teeny weeny `cry me a river' romance I couldn't help but find myself completely enthralled by the story and characters.  I just can't explain it, maybe I've changed, maybe this night I was just in the mood, as it were, for a heartwarming little story about a teenage girl and her love for the cute funny best friend. I pride myself for my consistency, in my taste in music, movies, my political beliefs, etc, I'm nothing if not consistent. Logic, therefore, would tell me to hate this film, but I don't. In fact, I love it, so for the sake of the reading public (you guys) I will try to explain, to myself as well as to you, just why it is I loved this movie.Makoto, Chiaki, and Kosuke are the best of friends. Just like any classic friend trio their personalities vary a lot, Makoto (the lead female) being mostly carefree and fun loving, Kosuke being the brains of the outfit, while Chiaki is laid back, lazy, but fun to be around. Together they make an inseparable team, playing a little catch, singing a little karioke, or just riding bikes their bikes. Like any good anime this films main strength lies with its characters. Rarely does an anime film capture so perfectly the character and personality of its characters, and even rarer are examples of anime that do this for teenage characters. At no point in time did I feel like I was watching a movie about fictional characters in a fictional world with fictional problems, instead I felt like I was simply watching three normal everyday people as they interact with each other and the world around them. I cannot overstate how amazing these characters are. So that helps explain why I love this film, as characters are the foundation upon which any story is built. That's not what surprises me here.No, the surprising part is that the  love triangles and twist ending didn't completely turn me off to this film. After all, those are just the kind of things that usually activate the `let's trash a movie' part of my brain. It's my natural response. My BS flag goes up faster than it takes for an Elfen Lied character to take their clothes off. My fingers find their way to the C-R-A-P buttons on my keyboard, and I go on a funny rant that gets on the nerves of every fanboy on the internet. Overall a lot of fun, you all should try it sometime. Let this movie serve as an example to the Twilight fans of the world, to the writers who make their living writing crappy teen romances to sappy/shallow readers. Let this also serve as an example to all the snobby critics (myself included) who would normally never give a story like this a chance. The lesson being that ANY story can be done well provided the characters are strong enough to drive it. At its core this film is a teen age love story, and in the hands of an unskilled writer (Stephanie Meyers is but one example) this story would be complete and utter nonsense void of all artistic or entertainment value. But in the hands of a skilled writer, a visionary director, and talented actors, art is made. And that is what this movie is. Art.I watched this movie years ago and never quite got around to finishing the review for it, but at the time I gave it a 4/5. Upon seeing it again I've realized that rating wasn't enough, so I'll bump this up to a 5/5. Yes, I am that impressed by it. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is an amazing anime film reminiscent of the movies of the legendary Studio Ghibli. The art, the music, the cinematography, he visuals, all add to the story to create something of a modest masterpiece. Does it have its flaws? Yes, most notably the blatant plot holes that litter it especially near the end of the film, but compared to the overall quality of the movie such transgressions can easily be forgiven and forgotten.I love this movie. I hope you love it too.Replay value; moderate.",5,This is the kind of movie that I shouldn't like.,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,5393,"['bone', 'body', 'telling', 'Jonathan', 'romance', 'time',

1183599,A3LIWTQDSQ5UOO,B001DXPWO2,"Jonathan Oyama ""Welcome to die!""","[3, 3]","This is one of the best damn anime films ever made, if not the best.I haven't heard about Yasutaka Tsutsui's original novel on which this movie is based on. ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is a prequel to the novel. But God, this is a masterpiece, with dazzling computer animation, backgrounds that even Makoto Shinkai couldn't handle and the most satisfying drama I've ever seen.The anime involves Makoto Konno, a high school girl who is clumsier than ever. She hangs around, playing baseball with her buddies, studious Kosuke Tsuda and shaggy Chiaki Mamiya. One day, sneaking around a chemistry lab, she falls onto a seed. Little does she know that this seed has special abilities.On her bicycle ride down a hill, a train is about to cross, and Makoto's wheels lock. Just when she gets hit, she ends up back on the top of the hill, before the train ever crossed. And she's still alive. When Makoto arrives to talk to her aunt about her mind-tripping experience, her aunt gives the suggestion that she went through a time delay. Her aunt says that some girls her age have the ability to jump to a different time when they least expect it. Is this just a coincidence?No, it's not coincidence. In fact, in the middle of her time travels, this story turns into a heavily emotional romance. As much as Makoto wants to deny her feelings at first, she cannot help but admire the boy who also keeps her safe from danger. This is one of those films in which people cannot help but cry.By the time viewers understand how Makoto's time traveling works, we can't help but wish that Chiaki would stick around a little longer, to help Makoto out. After all, they are extremely lovable as a couple, and they care for each other so deeply.But even when we just think that Makoto will end up all alone, the director manages to slip in a great ending. This is one of those films that will cheer anyone up. The characters have such strong emotional bonds. And the use of time travel is mind tripping. Computer-generated images of LCD timers litter the time dimension through which Makoto heads into the past. The backgrounds are gorgeous.Really, there's almost no better romantic anime film than ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time.""

One day, her bicycle brakes won't work, and she finds herself about to be killed by crashing into a train passing her lane.  Fortunately, a miracle occurs - and she finds herself having time-jumped backwards safe and sound.After talking to her aunt, who had a similar experience, she experiments and finds that she can do it again, begining with small things like preventing the poaching of a snack by her sister.  But when things start progressing to slightly more serious matters and she takes a series of jumps in a panic when she realizes that one of her best guys is about to say something to her privately that will take them to a place from which they can't come back that she isn't sure she's ready to go, things take a dark turn and spiral out of control - and she finds that this time, she might not be able to fix what she's done...Part sci-fi with a neat twist that anyone who isn't familiar with the source material probably won't see coming and part teen drama with an achingly accurate depiction of that critical time in life and personal development, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a warm, poignant work that should be in the collection of any anime fan.",5,Timeless,1227398400,"11 23, 2008",2008,1658,"['When', 'put', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Leapt', 'Time', 'DVD', 'player', 'expected', 'very', 'good', 'albeit', 'light', 'anime', 'movie', 'What', 'got', 'instead', 'was', 'emotional', 'experience', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'moving', 'anime', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far.Makoto', 'Konno', 'slightly', 'clumsy', 'tomboy', 'verge', 'age', 'right', 'when', 'teens', 'start', 'looking', 'opposite', 'sex', 'differently', 'priority', 'hanging', 'out', 'two', 'best', 'buddies', 'cheeky', 'endearing', 'Chiaki', 'Mamiya', 'evenheaded', 'gentlemanly', 'Kosuke', 'Tsuda', 'One', 'day', 'bicycle', 'brakes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'work', 'be', 'killed', 'crashing', 'train', 'passing', 'lane', 'Fortunately', 'miracle', 'having', 'time-jumped', 'backwards', 'safe', 'sound.After', 'talking', 'aunt', 'who', 'had', 'similar', 'experience', 'experiments', 'finds', 'can', 'do', 'again', 'begining', 'small', 'things', 'preventing', 'poaching', 'snack', 'sister', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'progressing', 'slightly', 'more', 'serious', 'matters', 'series', 'jumps', 'panic', 'when', 'one', 'best', 'guys', 'say', 'something', 'privately', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'back', ""n't"", 'sure', 'ready', 'go', 'things', 'take', 'dark', 'turn', 'spiral', 'control', 'time', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'fix', 'what', 'done', 'Part', 'sci-fi', 'neat', 'twist', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'source', 'material', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'part', 'teen', 'drama', 'achingly', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'critical', 'time', 'life', 'personal', 'development', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Leapt', 'Time', 'warm', 'poignant', 'work', 'should', 'be', 'collection', 'anime', 'fan']",N/A

The heroine is given the ability to travel back in time.  At first she uses her powers frivilously but, under the guidance of an aunt who once had the ability herself, she learns to use it more responsibly.  While this is going on, she has to make up her mind if she wants to become romantically involved with one or the other of her male high school buddies she plays baseball with.  One of them has a secret...The target audience is teenage girls (it's a ""shojo"" movie), so I didn't enjoy it as much as others might.  You might call it a romantic comedy, but there isn't that much romance, and it doesn't really have a lot of jokes.  It will make you smile rather than laugh.  Once, when the heroine is crying, they make her face ""cartoony,"" and it makes what should be a serious scene silly-looking.

1183618,AONCQPRX7Y1ZY,B001DXPWO2,Ron,"[0, 0]","At a glance:""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"" is a film that explores that desire we all have to go back and change how certain events worked out in our lives.  The main character find herself to have this ability, but how did she get it, and what if any complications are brought about by changing things?  The film is another exceptional work by director Mamoru Hosoda, who has been pegged by many to be the director to succeed the great Hayao Miyazaki in directing.  Incredible acting, complimented with great story telling, with vibrant backgrounds and animation make this film a classic that all ages can enjoy.Some details (and spoilers):This film in particular brought about my interest in director Mamoru Hosoda, as he delivered an exceptional film that is easy to recommend to others.  Often times with anime films you really need to consider the content, the genre, and the associated appeal, whereas I don't even consider these when suggesting this film to others.  It has an appeal that exists at different levels, both to younger audiences, as well as older audiences, all the while maintaining a sense of good pacing and timing that keep you genuinely interested in the characters.  The idea of going back in time has unfortunately obtained something of a stigma, but this film goes above that by not using time machines, and not altering world history.  The main character wishes to change the events in her life not out of her desire for greed or power, but for some very relatable reasons that help you to feel empathy toward her and what she is going through.  Ultimately the film begins to address some of the consequences that her actions have had, and you're left feeling as though you gained something from the experience  I found myself enjoying all elements of the film and I didn't have trouble ""getting into it"" or being distracted at points that weren't done correctly.  This film had a lot of love go into it, and I believe that's why many have taken so well to it in return.Pros:* The high definition version is crisp, clear, and really shows off the beautiful palette used for this film.* Voice acting on the dub and sub were both incredibly well done, the emotion of the characters came through, and didn't feel forced.* Bonus features are included with this release on the DVD that comes with it (this does not include the DVD version of the film)* Great story, good pacing, and effective directing establish this film.Cons:* The release is not a DVD/Blu-Ray Combo* The features included are on a DVD rather than a Blu-Ray* While not incredibly expensive, the Blu-Ray is still a little more expensive than maybe it should be for a movie.",5,"Finally, a family film that transcends time and space (kind of)",1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,2669,"['glance', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Leapt', 'Time', 'film', 'desire', 'have', 'go', 'back', 'change', 'how', 'certain', 'events', 'worked', 'out', 'lives', 'main', 'character', 'find', 'have', 'ability', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'what', 'complications', 'are', 'brought', 'changing', 'things', 'film', 'exceptional', 'work', 'director', 'Mamoru', 'Hosoda', 'who', 'been', 'pegged', 'many', 'be', 'director', 'succeed', 'great', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'directing', 'Incredible', 'acting', 'complimented', 'great', 'story', 'telling', 'vibrant', 'backgrounds', 'animation', 'make', 'film', 'classic', 'ages', 'can', 'enjoy.Some', 'details', 'spoilers', 'film', 'particular', 'brought', 'interest', 'director', 'Mamoru', 'Hosoda', 'delivered', 'exceptional', 'film', 'easy', 'recommend', 'others', 'Often', 'anime', 'films', 'really', 'need', 'consider', 'content', 'genre', 'associated', 'appeal', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'consider', 'when', 'suggesting', 'film', 'others', 'appeal', 'different', 'levels', 'younger', 'audiences', 'as', 'well', 'older', 'audiences', 'while', 'maintaining', 'sense', 'good', 'pacing', 'timing', 'keep', 'genuinely', 'interested', 'characters', 'idea', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'unfortunately', 'obtained', 'something', 'stigma', 'film', 'not', 'using', 'time', 'machines', 'not', 'altering', 'world', 'history', 'main', 'character', 'wishes', 'change', 'events', 'life', 'not', 'desire', 'greed', 'power', 'very', 'relatable', 'reasons', 'help', 'feel', 'empathy', 'what', 'going', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'address', 'consequences', 'actions', 'have', 'had', ""'re"", 'left', 'feeling', 'gained', 'something', 'experience', 'found', 'enjoying', 'elements', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'trouble', 'getting', 'being', 'distracted', 'points', 'were', ""n't"", 'done', 'correctly', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'love', 'go', 'believe', 'why', 'many', 'have', 'taken', 'so', 'well', 'return.Pros', '*', 'high', 'definition', 'version', 'crisp', 'clear', 'really', 'beautiful', 'palette', 'used', 'film', '*', 'Voice', 'acting', 'dub', 'sub', 'were', 'incredibly', 'well', 'done', 'emotion', 'characters', 'came', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'forced', '*', 'Bonus', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'release', 'DVD', 'not', 'include', 'DVD', 'version', 'film', 'Great', 'story', 'good', 'pacing', 'effective', 'directing', 'establish', 'film.Cons', 'release', 'not', 'DVD/Blu-Ray', 'Combo*', 'features', 'included', 'are', 'DVD', 'rather', 'Blu-Ray*', 'not', 'incredibly', 'expensive', 'Blu-Ray', 'still', 'little', 'more', 'expensive', 'maybe', 'should', 'be', 'movie']",N/A

The film then follows her as she tried to resolve these issues and get her life back on track.
