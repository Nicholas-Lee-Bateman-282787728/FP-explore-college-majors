1013176,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B000HDRAP8,David Bower,"[3, 3]","I must agree with the other reviewers that this performance is not purely Gilbert and Sullivan but it was purely fun and entertaining to me!It can stand on its own as a joyous fun time of laughter and entertainment. I watched it again last night and by the time it was over I was laughing and refreshed by the experience. Yes, it does have some flaws but these are easily overlooked in my opinion as an evening of first class entertainment unfolds.Some of the inside jokes went completely over my head, but this again did not present any insurmountable obstacles for me. I thought the dance with the dolls in Act 2 was hilarious.If you are a Gilbert and Sullivan purist then this production may offend you, as it does some of the reviewers; if you are looking for a well produced and performed evening of musical fun then this may well provide it for you!",5,Thoroughly Entertaining Although Not Purist,1273795200,"05 14, 2010",2010,855,"['must', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'performance', 'not', 'purely', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'was', 'purely', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'joyous', 'fun', 'time', 'laughter', 'entertainment', 'watched', 'again', 'last', 'night', 'time', 'was', 'was', 'laughing', 'refreshed', 'experience', 'Yes', 'have', 'flaws', 'are', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'opinion', 'evening', 'first', 'class', 'entertainment', 'unfolds.Some', 'inside', 'jokes', 'went', 'completely', 'head', 'again', 'did', 'not', 'present', 'insurmountable', 'obstacles', 'thought', 'dance', 'dolls', 'Act', '2', 'was', 'hilarious.If', 'are', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'purist', 'then', 'production', 'may', 'offend', 'reviewers', 'are', 'looking', 'well', 'produced', 'performed', 'evening', 'musical', 'fun', 'then', 'may', 'well', 'provide']","Gilbert & Sullivan - The Gondoliers / David Hobson, Roger Lemke, Australian Opera"

And there are many delightfully 'stage tricks' which make this version the best that I have ever seen.But one must turn on the sub-titles to enjoy the 'in jokes' which pepper the story.By the British accents and mannerisms, one would think this was a British cast, but no, the Australians do enormous justice to the language, only slipping in the vernacular for the Australian jokes.A thoroughly enjoyable piece to watch, again and again.

1013178,A3VLAZEPO9UJEA,B000HDRAP8,L. E. Cantrell,"[8, 13]","This is a revival of the Stratford, Ontario, production of ""The Gondoliers.""  It is, therefore, putrid at second hand.  (I hastily add that this is not the fault of the talented Australian performers; they were victims of the unspeakable director and original producers who were fully given over to the demented theory that the roots of the G&S; comic operas lay in the English music hall and panto.)Previous reviewers have specified some of the horrors of this production.  I shall not repeat them here.  I merely point out that a male performer who was very good in Australian Opera's ""Patience,"" which was based on the excellent English National Opera production, is here thrust into the wigs and gowns of the Duchess of Plaza-Toro.  In the words of the Bard of Avon, ""Oh, horrible, horrible, most horrible.""The only positive thing that can be said of this train wreck is that the AO people, by and large, can sing--a talent wholly absent in the DVD of the original, Canadian version of this piteous, misadventured, overthrown production.",1,The mad Canuck beast rises again,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,1041,"['revival', 'Stratford', 'Ontario', 'production', 'Gondoliers', 'therefore', 'putrid', 'second', 'hand', 'hastily', 'add', 'not', 'fault', 'talented', 'Australian', 'performers', 'were', 'victims', 'unspeakable', 'director', 'original', 'producers', 'who', 'were', 'fully', 'given', 'demented', 'theory', 'roots', 'G', 'S', 'comic', 'operas', 'lay', 'English', 'music', 'hall', 'panto', 'Previous', 'reviewers', 'have', 'specified', 'horrors', 'production', 'shall', 'not', 'repeat', 'here', 'merely', 'point', 'out', 'male', 'performer', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Australian', 'Opera', 'Patience', 'was', 'based', 'excellent', 'English', 'National', 'Opera', 'production', 'here', 'thrust', 'wigs', 'gowns', 'Duchess', 'Plaza-Toro', 'words', 'Bard', 'Avon', 'Oh', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'most', 'horrible', 'only', 'positive', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'train', 'wreck', 'AO', 'people', 'large', 'can', 'sing', 'talent', 'wholly', 'absent', 'DVD', 'original', 'Canadian', 'version', 'piteous', 'misadventured', 'overthrown', 'production']","Gilbert & Sullivan - The Gondoliers / David Hobson, Roger Lemke, Australian Opera"

1013180,A2WFYKXM38GAAO,B000HDRAP8,mercat37,"[1, 1]","I have seen bad Gilbert & Sullivan before. Unfortunately, particularly in the realm of video performance, that is not unusual. What makes this one so disappointing is that it had the potential to be truly excellent. The cast is fantastic - great singers, good actors, brimming with enthusiasm. The costumes and staging are imaginative. The direction is a little lacking (some cast members stand woodenly while singing), but nothing terrible. I could even have accepted the Duchess being played by a man in drag, since he was at least entertaining.The travesty lies in the slaughter, by rewrite, of the lyrics. Multiple songs were ""updated"" in very unfunny ways. Not just a lyric here and there, or a ""modern"" verse added to the end - but a wholesale rewrite of the entire song, save a few words in the chorus. ""Royal Queen"" in particular comes to mind. The cast performed it brilliantly, but the new lyrics were very jarring.The sound and picture are also nothing to speak of, though that is perhaps not surprising for a 1989 production. The actors appear to have been miked from the front, so that when they move toward the back of the stage, their voices fade out a bit. Mercifully, the mikes don't pick up their stomping feet, unlike some G&S; videos I have seen.That said, I would watch it again, or at least listen to the soundtrack, because there's a certain freshness in a live recording that just doesn't come through even in the best studio recording. And the singing really is good. Roger Lemke and David Hobson as Giuseppe and Marco are a delight. Lemke has a great voice. Hobson has an amazing upper range, shown off to good effect in ""We're Called Gondolieri"" and ""Take a Pair of Sparkling Eyes."" It's also interesting to see him in an early role. Judging by his performances in Pinafore and Pirates (20 years later), he has become a much better actor!",3,Could have been so much more,1259712000,"12 2, 2009",2009,1865,"['have', 'seen', 'bad', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'Unfortunately', 'particularly', 'realm', 'video', 'performance', 'not', 'unusual', 'What', 'one', 'so', 'disappointing', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'truly', 'excellent', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'great', 'singers', 'good', 'actors', 'brimming', 'enthusiasm', 'costumes', 'staging', 'are', 'imaginative', 'direction', 'little', 'lacking', 'cast', 'members', 'stand', 'woodenly', 'singing', 'nothing', 'terrible', 'could', 'even', 'have', 'accepted', 'Duchess', 'being', 'played', 'man', 'drag', 'was', 'least', 'entertaining.The', 'travesty', 'slaughter', 'rewrite', 'lyrics', 'Multiple', 'songs', 'were', 'updated', 'very', 'unfunny', 'ways', 'Not', 'just', 'lyric', 'here', 'there', 'modern', 'verse', 'added', 'end', 'wholesale', 'rewrite', 'entire', 'song', 'save', 'few', 'words', 'chorus', 'Royal', 'Queen', 'particular', 'mind', 'cast', 'performed', 'brilliantly', 'new', 'lyrics', 'were', 'very', 'jarring.The', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'also', 'nothing', 'speak', 'perhaps', 'not', 'surprising', '1989', 'production', 'actors', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'miked', 'front', 'when', 'move', 'back', 'stage', 'voices', 'fade', 'out', 'bit', 'Mercifully', 'mikes', 'do', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'stomping', 'feet', 'G', 'S', 'videos', 'have', 'seen.That', 'said', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'least', 'listen', 'soundtrack', 'certain', 'freshness', 'live', 'recording', 'just', ""n't"", 'come', 'even', 'best', 'studio', 'recording', 'singing', 'really', 'good', 'Roger', 'Lemke', 'David', 'Hobson', 'Giuseppe', 'Marco', 'are', 'delight', 'Lemke', 'great', 'voice', 'Hobson', 'amazing', 'upper', 'range', 'shown', 'good', 'effect', ""'re"", 'Called', 'Gondolieri', 'Take', 'Pair', 'Sparkling', 'Eyes', 'also', 'interesting', 'see', 'early', 'role', 'Judging', 'performances', 'Pinafore', 'Pirates', '20', 'years', 'later', 'become', 'much', 'better', 'actor']","Gilbert & Sullivan - The Gondoliers / David Hobson, Roger Lemke, Australian Opera"
