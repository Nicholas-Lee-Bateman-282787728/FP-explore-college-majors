Katey Sagel was pregnant so the writers decided to make her character Peggy pregnant as well. It was a good idea but tradegy struck and Sagel had a miscarriage so the whole pregnancy thing was turned into a dream/nightmare sequence. After that this show really lost steam, season 7 was a mess and I never watched the remaining seasons, the magic was gone. Season 6 had some special episodes so I recommend this raunchy gem, enjoy!",4,Bittersweet season.,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,547,"['Married', 'Children', 'Complete', 'Sixth', 'Season', 'opinion', 'was', 'last', 'enjoyable', 'long-running', 'sitcom', 'Katey', 'Sagel', 'was', 'pregnant', 'writers', 'decided', 'make', 'character', 'Peggy', 'pregnant', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'good', 'idea', 'tradegy', 'struck', 'Sagel', 'had', 'miscarriage', 'so', 'whole', 'pregnancy', 'thing', 'was', 'turned', 'dream/nightmare', 'sequence', 'show', 'really', 'lost', 'steam', 'season', '7', 'was', 'mess', 'never', 'watched', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'magic', 'was', 'gone', 'Season', '6', 'had', 'special', 'episodes', 'recommend', 'raunchy', 'gem', 'enjoy']",Married... with Children: Season 6
1025554,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B000JBWWQK,andy8047,"[4, 8]","The 1991-92 season,the sixth of Fox's Emmy-winning Married...With Children,begins with the pregnancies of Peggy Bundy(Katey Sagal) and Marcy Rhoades D'Arcy(Amanda Bearse). Sagal's real-life pregnancy was written into the show and unfortunately,she miscarried. She did have children by her now-ex-husband Jack White,though. Peggy did miscarry with her and her husband Al's(Ed O'Neill) third child. The child would have enjoyed(to a degree) a good life with his/her siblings Kelly(Christina Applegate) and Bud(David Faustino). Kelly and Bud lambasted Al for impregnating Peggy against her preference. On September 8,1991 when this season began,Marcy and her second husband Jefferson(Happy Days veteran Ted McGinley) had been married for nine or ten months. Marcy did contemplate having children with her first husband Steve Rhoades. McGinley is now an official MWC cast member. He joined MWC in late 1990 but on a frequent guest star basis. However,McGinley's inaugural appearance on the show was in the season 4 episode IT'S A BUNDYFUL LIFE. For the first time since his final appearance as a regular in the season 4 episode ROCK AND ROLL GIRL,David Garrison as Steve Rhoades,makes a guest appearance in THE EGG & I. Accountant-turned-forest ranger Steve is wanted by the FBI for stealing a rare hawk egg. He hides out in his old neighborhood amongst the Bundys' home and his ex-wife's home. Also,although he called it quits on his marriage to Marcy,Steve intended to reclaim her,not knowing she had remarried. Marcy was far from enthused about Steve's visit and he and Jefferson fight a duel. The Bundys witness the duel and a camera is in Peggy's hands. The Bundys were surprised by Steve's visit as well. But Steve is caught and taken into police custody. In the season finale,the Bundys travel to England. The other episodes are great. Al still manages his shoe store,Peggy still is a lowly mobile housewife,Kelly is working various jobs and attending college and Bud is doing the same as Kelly. The late briard Buck is still like Peggy,lowly mobile(he was by this time elderly and died before the series ended). This season has a mostly new opening montage(personal scenes for almost every cast member). And in the closing montage,Al and Peggy are still sitting on their sofa. This montage has been used since the beginning of 1990.

""Married... with Children"" is the outrageously funny comedy sitcom that changed our view of the typical family comedy. The comedy series follows the lives of luckless shoe salesman Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), his dysfunctional family and his bothersome next-door neighbors. In this hilarious sixth season, the announcement of Peg's (Katey Sagal) pregnancy leaves the family in shock and forces Al to run away from home. Kelly (Christina Applegate) lands her own talk show and goes to Hollywood. Bud (David Faustino) tries to impress women with the help of his hip-hop alter-ego Grandmaster B. In the three-part season finale, the Bundys win a free trip to England but are unaware that some vengeful villagers seek to get rid of all male Bundys to break a curse cast upon their village. The sixth season marks star Amanda Bearse's directorial d&eacute;but on the show and the brief return of David Garrison as Steve Rhoades. It also includes guest stars like Jon Lovitz, Traci Lords, Fred Willard, Steve Carlton, Ed ""Too Tall"" Jones and Sugar Ray Leonard.Though the sixth season of ""Married with Children: The Complete Sixth Season"" will certainly leave you laughing for hours, this 3-disc DVD set is certainly nothing to rave about. All 26 hilarious episodes of the sixth season are presented in their original full screen format. The picture quality is noticeably cleaner and sharper than your average television rebroadcast. Its simple 2.0 Dolby Digital sound is rather satisfactory. There are no bonus features included in this 3-disc DVD set. Though the lack of extras is certainly a big letdown, ""Married with Children: The Complete Sixth Season"" earns a decent ""B-"".",4,America's Most Outrageous Family,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,1785,"['Learn', 'what', 'being', 'member', 'Bundy', 'family', 'Married', 'Children', 'Complete', 'Sixth', 'Season', 'Married', 'Children', 'outrageously', 'funny', 'comedy', 'sitcom', 'changed', 'view', 'typical', 'family', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'series', 'lives', 'luckless', 'shoe', 'salesman', 'Al', 'Bundy', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'bothersome', 'next-door', 'neighbors', 'hilarious', 'sixth', 'season', 'announcement', 'Peg', 'Katey', 'Sagal', 'pregnancy', 'family', 'shock', 'forces', 'Al', 'run', 'away', 'home', 'Kelly', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'own', 'talk', 'show', 'Hollywood', 'Bud', 'David', 'Faustino', 'impress', 'women', 'help', 'hip-hop', 'alter-ego', 'Grandmaster', 'B', 'three-part', 'season', 'finale', 'Bundys', 'win', 'free', 'trip', 'England', 'are', 'unaware', 'vengeful', 'villagers', 'seek', 'get', 'rid', 'male', 'Bundys', 'break', 'curse', 'cast', 'village', 'sixth', 'season', 'marks', 'star', 'Amanda', 'Bearse', 'directorial', 'd', 'eacute', 'show', 'brief', 'return', 'David', 'Garrison', 'Steve', 'Rhoades', 'also', 'guest', 'stars', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'Traci', 'Lords', 'Fred', 'Willard', 'Steve', 'Carlton', 'Ed', 'Too', 'Tall', 'Jones', 'Sugar', 'Ray', 'Leonard.Though', 'sixth', 'season', 'Married', 'Children', 'Complete', 'Sixth', 'Season', 'will', 'certainly', 'leave', 'laughing', 'hours', '3-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'rave', 'about', '26', 'hilarious', 'episodes', 'sixth', 'season', 'are', 'presented', 'original', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'picture', 'quality', 'noticeably', 'cleaner', 'sharper', 'average', 'television', 'rebroadcast', 'simple', '2.0', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'sound', 'rather', 'satisfactory', 'are', 'bonus', 'included', '3-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'lack', 'extras', 'certainly', 'big', 'letdown', 'Married', 'Children', 'Complete', 'Sixth', 'Season', 'decent', 'B-']",Married... with Children: Season 6
