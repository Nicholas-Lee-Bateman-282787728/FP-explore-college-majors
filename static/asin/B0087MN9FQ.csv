The Pig Who Cried Werewolf was cheesy, Night of the Living Carrots was great!, and The Ghost of Lord Farquaad...let's just say very strange, especially since it was made for 3D but you can't view it in 3D so it makes it look weird at times. These are VERY short ""short movies."" You're better of purchasing the new combo pack that was just released of ALL the Shrek & Monsters vs. Aliens Halloween movies (which includes this one) that are out called Dreamworks Shrek's Spooky Stories. It has Shrek's Thrilling Tales, Scared Shrekless + Thriller, and the new Monsters vs. Aliens Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space (the best out of all the shorts in my opinion!).",3,1 out of the 3 short films were good...,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",2012,786,"['short', 'films', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'ages', '5', 'up', 'ghost', 'zombie', 'carrots', 'turning', 'everyone', 'zombies', 'Pig', 'Who', 'Cried', 'Werewolf', 'was', 'cheesy', 'Night', 'Living', 'Carrots', 'was', 'great', 'Ghost', 'Lord', 'Farquaad', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'very', 'strange', 'especially', 'was', 'made', '3D', 'ca', ""n't"", 'view', '3D', 'look', 'weird', 'times', 'are', 'VERY', 'short', 'short', 'movies', ""'re"", 'better', 'purchasing', 'new', 'combo', 'pack', 'was', 'just', 'released', 'Shrek', 'Monsters', 'vs.', 'Aliens', 'Halloween', 'movies', 'one', 'are', 'out', 'called', 'Dreamworks', 'Shrek', 'Spooky', 'Stories', 'Shrek', 'Thrilling', 'Tales', 'Scared', 'Shrekless', '+', 'Thriller', 'new', 'Monsters', 'vs.', 'Aliens', 'Mutant', 'Pumpkins', 'Outer', 'Space', 'best', 'shorts', 'opinion']",N/A

The pigs episode was ok, but not that great. The monsters vs. aliens episode was really good and would make this the only reason for buying this. The third episode, the Shrek episode, was a real let down. It is the Shrek 3D movie that came with the Story so far collection which included Shrek, Shrek 3D, Shrek 2, and a bonus disc.

I thought SHREK'S THRILLING TALES might be more of the same. SHREK'S THRILLING TALES includes three cartoon shorts and one of them doesn't even involve anyone from the Shrek universe. The three shorts are:""Night of the Living Carrots"" - This short doesn't feature anyone from the Shrek universe, but instead features the cast of MONSTERS VS. ALIENS. After the heroics in ""Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space"" the Monsters find themselves fighting off a horde of zombie carrots grown from the blood of the now defeated Mutant Pumpkins. The carrots turn anyone and anything they bite into a mindless zombie. B.O.B. is immune to their attacks and has to save the world.""The Pig Who Cried Werewolf"" - This short features the Three Little Pigs and the Wolf. The Three Little Pigs return home after a night at the movies to discover they have a new next door neighbor. The Pig Who Built the Brick House is in a wheel chair with a broken leg and starts spying on their new neighbor. He's sure the neighbor is up to no good and tries to warn his brothers, but they don't believe him.""The Ghost of Lord Farquaad"" - As Shrek and Fiona are preparing to leave on their honeymoon, Fiona is kidnapped and Shrek and Donkey race to save her. They are led to a cemetery and discover that the ghost of Farquaad is behind the plot. He couldn't be a king in life, so he plans to rule the underworld with Fiona at his side as his queen. While he prepares to throw Fiona over a waterfall, he sends a giant stone dragon to kill Shrek and Donkey. This ogre and his faithful steed never seem to get a break.I enjoyed ""The Pig Who Cried Werewolf"" and even though it's not part of the Shrek universe, I liked ""Night of the Living Carrots,"" too. However, I've already seen THE GHOST OF LORD FARQUAAD before. It was originally a ride at Universal entitled SHREK 4-D and was later released on DVD as SHREK 3-D. Now it's been re-released here as filler. I wish there was another new Shrek short that was included, but there's not. It's rather disappointing as all of the shorts on SCARED SHREKLESS were entertaining. There are just so many great stories that could be told in a short format. Dreamworks should be pumping them out, but they aren't.There really aren't any extra features on the DVD except for the usual trailers and the promos for several other animated Dreamworks projects (MASTERMIND, HOW TO TRAIN A DRAGON, etc.).Overall, though ""The Pig Who Cried Wolf"" and ""Night of the Living Carrots"" are a blast, SHREK'S THRILLING TALES is a let down because over half of the disc is a re-release of SHREK 3-D, but under a different name.",3,Two New Shorts and One Retread,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,2701,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'Shrek', 'franchised', 'enjoyed', 'last', 'year', 'DVD', 'release', 'SCARED', 'SHREKLESS', 'thought', 'SHREK', 'THRILLING', 'TALES', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'same', 'SHREK', 'THRILLING', 'TALES', 'three', 'cartoon', 'shorts', 'one', ""n't"", 'even', 'involve', 'anyone', 'Shrek', 'universe', 'three', 'shorts', 'are', 'Night', 'Living', 'Carrots', 'short', ""n't"", 'feature', 'anyone', 'Shrek', 'universe', 'instead', 'cast', 'MONSTERS', 'VS.', 'ALIENS', 'heroics', 'Mutant', 'Pumpkins', 'Outer', 'Space', 'Monsters', 'find', 'fighting', 'off', 'horde', 'zombie', 'carrots', 'grown', 'blood', 'now', 'defeated', 'Mutant', 'Pumpkins', 'carrots', 'turn', 'anyone', 'anything', 'bite', 'mindless', 'zombie', 'B.O.B', 'immune', 'attacks', 'save', 'world', 'Pig', 'Who', 'Cried', 'Werewolf', 'short', 'Three', 'Little', 'Pigs', 'Wolf', 'Three', 'Little', 'Pigs', 'return', 'home', 'night', 'movies', 'discover', 'have', 'new', 'next', 'door', 'neighbor', 'Pig', 'Who', 'Built', 'Brick', 'House', 'wheel', 'chair', 'broken', 'leg', 'spying', 'new', 'neighbor', 'sure', 'neighbor', 'good', 'tries', 'warn', 'brothers', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Ghost', 'Lord', 'Farquaad', 'Shrek', 'Fiona', 'are', 'preparing', 'leave', 'honeymoon', 'Fiona', 'kidnapped', 'Shrek', 'Donkey', 'race', 'save', 'are', 'led', 'cemetery', 'discover', 'ghost', 'Farquaad', 'plot', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'king', 'life', 'rule', 'underworld', 'Fiona', 'side', 'queen', 'throw', 'Fiona', 'waterfall', 'giant', 'stone', 'dragon', 'kill', 'Shrek', 'Donkey', 'ogre', 'faithful', 'steed', 'never', 'seem', 'get', 'break.I', 'enjoyed', 'Pig', 'Who', 'Cried', 'Werewolf', 'even', 'not', 'part', 'Shrek', 'universe', 'liked', 'Night', 'Living', 'Carrots', 'too', 'However', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'THE', 'GHOST', 'OF', 'LORD', 'FARQUAAD', 'was', 'originally', 'ride', 'Universal', 'entitled', 'SHREK', '4-D', 'was', 'later', 'released', 'DVD', 'SHREK', '3-D.', 'Now', 'been', 're-released', 'here', 'filler', 'wish', 'was', 'new', 'Shrek', 'short', 'was', 'included', 'not', 'rather', 'disappointing', 'shorts', 'SCARED', 'SHREKLESS', 'were', 'entertaining', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'stories', 'could', 'be', 'told', 'short', 'format', 'Dreamworks', 'should', 'be', 'pumping', 'out', ""aren't.There"", 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'usual', 'trailers', 'promos', 'several', 'other', 'animated', 'Dreamworks', 'projects', 'MASTERMIND', 'HOW', 'TO', 'TRAIN', 'A', 'DRAGON', 'etc', '.Overall', 'Pig', 'Who', 'Cried', 'Wolf', 'Night', 'Living', 'Carrots', 'are', 'blast', 'SHREK', 'THRILLING', 'TALES', 'let', 'down', 'because', 'half', 'disc', 're-release', 'SHREK', '3-D', 'different', 'name']",N/A
