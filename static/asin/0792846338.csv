156364,ADLVFFE4VBT8,0792846338,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","This 2-disc bundle is an interesting edition in the sense that you get the movie twice, on Blu AND on DVD.DISC ONEThe Blu-ray disc has the movie only in beautiful 1080p Blu resolution, of course, and featuring DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround sound plus French and Spanish audio tracks and English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.Disc one is why I bought THIS Misery - I already have a DVD edition - and, at this price, I'm glad I did it. Misery's Blu treatment is nothing short of spectacular. Since I was able to compare the 2 versions, with the DVD and the Blu playing simultaneously, it was easy to see the difference. It's not only Blu's higher resolution that reveals more detail - James Caan's 5 o'clock shade anyone? - but the colors are brighter and the picture overall is crisper. Same for the sound. The lossless (uncompressed) audio is a big plus even on a movie like this where most of the sound is dialog and creepy music.DISC TWOIs the 'curious' one, featuring the entire movie as a DVD and a relative large number of featurettes. I call it 'curious' because there is no mention on the back of the box of the movie's duplicate on the second disc - a mistake?Anyways, besides the movie there's the obligatory 'this is how we made this and we had so much fun making it' featurette, named 'Misery Loves Company'. We get to hear from James Caan, the always lovely and talented Kathy Bates, director Rob Reiner and so on.In addition, there is a SERIES of featurettes discussing 'stalking' which I will list because they are fun to watch:- Advice for the Stalked- Profile of a Stalker- Celebrity Stalkers- Anti-Stalking LawsThis is interesting because Annie (Kathy Bates) is not really a stalker. She is sick and she is Sheldon's (Caan) biggest fan but she's not stalking him, she only takes advantage of an opportunity.Also good is the ""Diagnosing Annie Wilkes"" featurette where a psychiatrist explains that Annie was:- psychotic- bi-polar- delusional- paranoid- abused as a childand a few more other defects that I can't remember now.THE MOVIEI love Stephen King, I've read a lot of his work and watched nearly all King-inspired movies but I'm not his biggest fan. While a fan, I am objective enough to admit that not all of the King movies are great and some are quite terrible. It's not the case with Misery. Thanks to Kathy Bates (Oscar for best actress) incredible performance, Caan's showing that he can act and inspired work from director Reiner and photography wizard Sonnenfeld, Misery is one of those few movies that you can watch again and again and never get tired of it. I do watch it every couple of years and, thanks to the Blu edition now, I will enjoy watching the movie even more.RATING THIS EDITIONThis Misery earns high grades for the Blu version. While inside a cheap plastic case - the kind that has holes cut in it to save a few pennies - the 2 discs feature enough quality and content to qualify this as the best Misery so far:- superior Blu rendering of the movie- unexpected second copy as a DVD- interesting, informative, actually watchable featurettes- reasonable priceThe 5 stars are well earned.",5,"The Blu-ray edition - It's better than perfect, it's divine",1269475200,"03 25, 2010",2010,3127,"['2-disc', 'bundle', 'interesting', 'edition', 'sense', 'get', 'movie', 'twice', 'Blu', 'AND', 'DVD.DISC', 'ONEThe', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'movie', 'only', 'beautiful', '1080p', 'Blu', 'resolution', 'course', 'featuring', 'DTS-HD', 'MA', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'French', 'Spanish', 'audio', 'tracks', 'English', 'SDH', 'French', 'Spanish', 'subtitles.Disc', 'one', 'why', 'bought', 'THIS', 'Misery', 'already', 'have', 'DVD', 'edition', 'price', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Misery', 'Blu', 'treatment', 'nothing', 'short', 'spectacular', 'was', 'able', 'compare', '2', 'versions', 'DVD', 'Blu', 'playing', 'simultaneously', 'was', 'easy', 'see', 'difference', 'not', 'only', 'Blu', 'higher', 'resolution', 'more', 'detail', 'James', 'Caan', '5', ""o'clock"", 'shade', 'anyone', 'colors', 'are', 'brighter', 'picture', 'overall', 'crisper', 'Same', 'sound', 'lossless', 'uncompressed', 'audio', 'big', 'even', 'movie', 'where', 'most', 'sound', 'dialog', 'creepy', 'music.DISC', 'TWOIs', ""'curious"", 'one', 'featuring', 'entire', 'movie', 'DVD', 'relative', 'large', 'number', 'featurettes', 'call', ""'curious"", 'mention', 'back', 'box', 'movie', 'duplicate', 'second', 'disc', 'mistake', 'Anyways', 'movie', 'obligatory', 'how', 'made', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'making', 'featurette', 'named', ""'Misery"", 'Company', 'get', 'hear', 'James', 'Caan', 'always', 'lovely', 'talented', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'so', 'on.In', 'addition', 'SERIES', 'featurettes', 'discussing', ""'stalking"", 'will', 'list', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'Advice', 'Stalked-', 'Profile', 'Stalker-', 'Celebrity', 'Stalkers-', 'Anti-Stalking', 'LawsThis', 'interesting', 'Annie', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'not', 'really', 'stalker', 'sick', 'Sheldon', 'Caan', 'biggest', 'fan', 'not', 'stalking', 'only', 'advantage', 'opportunity.Also', 'good', 'Diagnosing', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'featurette', 'where', 'psychiatrist', 'Annie', 'was', 'psychotic-', 'bi-polar-', 'delusional-', 'paranoid-', 'abused', 'childand', 'few', 'more', 'other', 'defects', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'now.THE', 'MOVIEI', 'love', 'Stephen', 'King', ""'ve"", 'read', 'lot', 'work', 'watched', 'nearly', 'King-inspired', 'movies', ""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'fan', 'am', 'objective', 'enough', 'admit', 'not', 'King', 'movies', 'are', 'great', 'are', 'quite', 'terrible', 'not', 'case', 'Misery', 'Thanks', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Oscar', 'best', 'actress', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Caan', 'showing', 'can', 'act', 'inspired', 'work', 'director', 'Reiner', 'photography', 'wizard', 'Sonnenfeld', 'Misery', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'do', 'watch', 'couple', 'years', 'thanks', 'Blu', 'edition', 'now', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'movie', 'even', 'more.RATING', 'THIS', 'EDITIONThis', 'Misery', 'high', 'grades', 'Blu', 'version', 'cheap', 'plastic', 'case', 'kind', 'holes', 'cut', 'save', 'few', 'pennies', '2', 'discs', 'feature', 'enough', 'quality', 'content', 'qualify', 'best', 'Misery', 'so', 'far', 'superior', 'Blu', 'rendering', 'movie-', 'unexpected', 'second', 'copy', 'DVD-', 'interesting', 'informative', 'actually', 'watchable', 'featurettes-', 'reasonable', 'priceThe', '5', 'stars', 'are', 'well', 'earned']",N/A

156373,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792846338,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Not a film I consider a horror movie, more a psychological thriller, `Misery' has got to be one of the most effective psychological thrillers to date.  This is thanks in large part to the dynamic Oscar winning (and deserving) performance by the legendary Kathy Bates.  In fact, this performance is so dynamic, so convincing that when I first saw this film I was scared sleepless for months it felt (I was merely ten when I saw this movie the first time).  It had such an impact on me that it wasn't until about a year ago that I even considered watching this movie again, and I am so glad that I did.  Now that I am older I can appreciate this film much more, and while it still manages to deliver chills to my spine I'm not hiding my face in the pillow either.  Since I've allowed the film back into my life I've already watched it a handful of times and it never ceases to amaze me.The film follows author Paul Sheldon as he finishes yet another novel, this time a departure from his successful `Misery' series.  As he sets off for home (tradition causes him to leave town in order to finish each novel) he's caught in the middle of a snow storm and suffers a terrible wreck.  Worse than the wreck though is what's waiting for him when he opens his eyes.  Annie Wilkes is a nurse who finds Paul on the side of the road and vouches to nurse him back to health.  Annie just so happens to be Paul's biggest fan, eccentric as she is, and so he offers to let her read his novel before anyone else has the opportunity.  This was a grave mistake for Annie is very dissatisfied with his work and holds him hostage forcing him to rewrite it to her satisfaction.  What ensues is a mental game of cat and mouse that is so brilliantly crafted it will have the audience at the edge of their seats.The acting is just brilliant here, Kathy Bates living up to all the hype surrounding her performance.  Annie Wilkes truly is one of the best, if not the best female villain created for the big screen and Kathy Bates' delivery is iconic.  Not to be left out of the equation though is James Caan who meets her every step of the way with a very convincing performance all his own.  Paul Sheldon is the perfect compliment to Annie Wilkes and it's a shame that Caan's portrayal didn't receive the Oscar nomination it deserved.  This is really Bates' movie though, but it's her chemistry with Caan that helps elevate her performance to superiority.  The supporting players are also great, especially that of Richard Farnsworth.  Rob Reiner also deserves some praise for his superb direction here.  He's not a director I'm generally blown away by but here he soars.  He takes Goldman's screenplay (of course adapted from King's masterful novel) and takes off with it.The character of Annie Wilkes is one for the books, a perfect example of the desperation that stems from loneliness and depravation and the pure insanity that it can spawn.  Bates' execution is flawless and continues to add layers to this complex character.`Misery' is one of those rare gems that gets better with time and will never go out of style.  I highly recommend this masterpiece to anyone looking for a good thrill, some good performances and overall one heck of a great movie.  Personally I recommend you check out the collector's edition over this DVD release, its well worth the extra dollars.",5,Consider me Misery's number one fan...,1193356800,"10 26, 2007",2007,3351,"['Not', 'film', 'consider', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Misery', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'date', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'dynamic', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'deserving', 'performance', 'legendary', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'fact', 'performance', 'so', 'dynamic', 'so', 'convincing', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'was', 'scared', 'sleepless', 'months', 'felt', 'was', 'merely', 'ten', 'when', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'had', 'such', 'impact', 'was', ""n't"", 'year', 'even', 'considered', 'watching', 'movie', 'again', 'am', 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'Now', 'am', 'older', 'can', 'appreciate', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'still', 'deliver', 'chills', 'spine', ""'m"", 'not', 'hiding', 'face', 'pillow', ""'ve"", 'allowed', 'film', 'back', 'life', ""'ve"", 'already', 'watched', 'handful', 'times', 'never', 'amaze', 'me.The', 'film', 'author', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'yet', 'novel', 'time', 'departure', 'successful', 'Misery', 'series', 'off', 'home', 'tradition', 'leave', 'town', 'order', 'finish', 'novel', 'caught', 'middle', 'snow', 'storm', 'terrible', 'wreck', 'Worse', 'wreck', 'though', 'what', 'waiting', 'when', 'eyes', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'nurse', 'who', 'Paul', 'side', 'road', 'vouches', 'nurse', 'back', 'health', 'Annie', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'Paul', 'biggest', 'fan', 'eccentric', 'so', 'let', 'read', 'novel', 'anyone', 'else', 'opportunity', 'was', 'grave', 'mistake', 'Annie', 'very', 'dissatisfied', 'work', 'hostage', 'forcing', 'rewrite', 'satisfaction', 'What', 'mental', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'will', 'have', 'audience', 'edge', 'seats.The', 'acting', 'just', 'brilliant', 'here', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'living', 'up', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'performance', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'truly', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'female', 'villain', 'created', 'big', 'screen', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'delivery', 'iconic', 'Not', 'be', 'left', 'equation', 'James', 'Caan', 'who', 'step', 'way', 'very', 'convincing', 'performance', 'own', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'shame', 'Caan', 'portrayal', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'deserved', 'really', 'Bates', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'Caan', 'elevate', 'performance', 'superiority', 'supporting', 'players', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'especially', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'also', 'praise', 'superb', 'direction', 'here', 'not', 'director', ""'m"", 'generally', 'blown', 'away', 'here', 'Goldman', 'screenplay', 'course', 'adapted', 'King', 'masterful', 'novel', 'off', 'it.The', 'character', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'one', 'books', 'perfect', 'example', 'desperation', 'loneliness', 'depravation', 'pure', 'insanity', 'can', 'spawn', 'Bates', 'execution', 'flawless', 'add', 'layers', 'complex', 'character.', 'Misery', 'one', 'rare', 'gems', 'better', 'time', 'will', 'never', 'go', 'style', 'highly', 'recommend', 'masterpiece', 'anyone', 'looking', 'good', 'thrill', 'good', 'performances', 'overall', 'one', 'heck', 'great', 'movie', 'Personally', 'recommend', 'check', 'out', 'collector', 'edition', 'DVD', 'release', 'well', 'extra', 'dollars']",N/A

But after years of success, he decides to kill the character once and for all and get on with his life. He finishes his book, but disaster strikes on his way back to New York. He gets caught in a snow storm and crashes his car. He is on the verge of death when a seemingly harmless nurse named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates in an Oscar - winning role), who claims she's his number one fan. At first, Paul really enjoys Annie's company. Then Annie has several outbursts (including the now infamous ankle - breaking sequence), and Paul becomes suspicous of her past. From here on it's a tense battle between cat and mouse. And if you've never read the book before, then you're in for one of the creepiest endings in your life.No movie fan should be without &quot;Misery&quot;. It is in a class of its own, different from other King classics like &quot;Carrie&quot;, &quot;Cuju&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot;.

This is not a usual Stephen King plot (I haven't read ""Misery"" at that time). Well, some car crash, a lady is nursing James Caan, blah, blah, blah..."" Anyway I was stupid enough to quit watching after those twenty minutes thinking it's some boring crap. If only had I watched another five minutes! Bacause when I did a couple of years later I was damning my own foolishness. ""Misery"" appeared to be one of the most thrilling and gripping chillers I've ever seen. The story is so simple you begin to believe it's quite possible. It really could happen in real life. Why not? There are plenty of lunatics out there.So if you haven't seen it (which I doubt), buy ""Misery"" right now. But watch first and then read, not to be disappointed, because books are almost always better then films :)And if you've seen the movie and just want to have it on DVD, I'd advise you to purchase British special edition (by Universal), available on amazon.co.uk. Unlike American one it has commentaries by director Rob Reiner and writer William Goldman, photo galleries, composer Marc Shaiman's ""Musical Misery Tour"" featurette and a half-hour ""Misery Loves Company"" documentary.

I must admit that I have never read King's novel on which this film was based, but it didn't stop the movie from chilling my bones. It was an effort just to sit through it; it's that intense. James Caan and especially Kathy Bates deliver truly spectacular performances as popular (and, to his grudge, commercialised) writer Paul Sheldon and his psychotic ""number one fan"" Annie Wilkes. The movie has a justified reputation as a two-actor film, as the twisted relationship the characters share is what makes the movie so memorable.Bed-ridden after being saved from a car crash in the midst of a blizzard in the Rocky Mountains, Paul Sheldon finds himself under the care of Annie Wilkes, a seemingly-kind recluse who lives for his novels about female romance hero ""Misery"". Paul soon finds out that Annie's seemingly positive attitude is completely deceptive, as she is not at all intent on letting her hero escape her grasp, or kill off her favourite character of his. She forces him to revive Misery, with a novel written just for her. Paul has no choice to comply, but even so he soon learns that Annie is not at all what she seems, and that trying to escape might result in unthinkable consequences.Bates deservedly won an Oscar for her portrayal as the unhinged Annie, who appears on the surface to be the epitome of kindness but is really a ticking time bomb that'll go off, messily, at the least effort. James Caan's performance is wonderful as well as the trapped writer trying his utmost to escape. The movie is chock-full of suspense as Sheldon puts his cunning mind to use in how to escape from Annie. However, she proves to be equally cunning. As such, the film has a definite 'cat-mouse' atmosphere to it - and we do fear for Sheldon, as Annie is the sort of character whose boundaries of mercy are vague to say the least. Most of the terror found in the film is psychological, but it does reach out into direct physical pain on occasion - one scene in particular is bound to haunt the viewer for a long time after viewing; it has something to do with diamond mines.What's probably the most frightening of all is how the character of Annie Wilkes shifts from psychotically raged to sweet and giggling, from her loving mother attitude to the devil in a woman's guise. Make no mistake, Misery is a psychological drama of the best degree. It's excellently written and acted, and it'll keep your heart racing to the finish. An excellent adaptation - even from one who's never read the novel.",5,Intense to say the least,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",2008,2597,"['ever', 'movie', 'made', 'feel', 'as', 'trapped', 'protagonist', 'Misery', 'right', 'there', 'must', 'admit', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'King', 'novel', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'movie', 'chilling', 'bones', 'was', 'effort', 'just', 'sit', 'intense', 'James', 'Caan', 'especially', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'deliver', 'truly', 'spectacular', 'performances', 'popular', 'grudge', 'commercialised', 'writer', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'psychotic', 'number', 'one', 'fan', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'movie', 'justified', 'reputation', 'two-actor', 'film', 'twisted', 'relationship', 'characters', 'share', 'what', 'movie', 'memorable.Bed-ridden', 'being', 'saved', 'car', 'crash', 'midst', 'blizzard', 'Rocky', 'Mountains', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'care', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'seemingly-kind', 'recluse', 'who', 'novels', 'female', 'romance', 'hero', 'Misery', 'Paul', 'soon', 'out', 'Annie', 'seemingly', 'positive', 'attitude', 'completely', 'deceptive', 'not', 'intent', 'letting', 'hero', 'escape', 'grasp', 'kill', 'off', 'favourite', 'character', 'revive', 'Misery', 'novel', 'written', 'just', 'Paul', 'choice', 'comply', 'even', 'so', 'soon', 'Annie', 'not', 'what', 'trying', 'escape', 'might', 'result', 'unthinkable', 'consequences.Bates', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'unhinged', 'Annie', 'who', 'surface', 'be', 'epitome', 'kindness', 'really', 'ticking', 'time', 'bomb', ""'ll"", 'go', 'off', 'messily', 'least', 'effort', 'James', 'Caan', 'performance', 'wonderful', 'as', 'well', 'trapped', 'writer', 'trying', 'utmost', 'escape', 'movie', 'chock-full', 'suspense', 'Sheldon', 'cunning', 'mind', 'use', 'how', 'escape', 'Annie', 'However', 'be', 'equally', 'cunning', 'such', 'film', 'definite', ""'cat-mouse"", 'atmosphere', 'do', 'fear', 'Sheldon', 'Annie', 'sort', 'character', 'boundaries', 'mercy', 'are', 'vague', 'say', 'least', 'Most', 'terror', 'found', 'film', 'psychological', 'reach', 'out', 'direct', 'physical', 'pain', 'occasion', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'bound', 'haunt', 'viewer', 'long', 'time', 'viewing', 'something', 'do', 'diamond', 'mines.What', 'probably', 'most', 'frightening', 'how', 'character', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'shifts', 'psychotically', 'raged', 'sweet', 'giggling', 'loving', 'mother', 'attitude', 'devil', 'woman', 'guise', 'Make', 'mistake', 'Misery', 'psychological', 'drama', 'best', 'degree', 'excellently', 'written', 'acted', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'heart', 'racing', 'finish', 'excellent', 'adaptation', 'even', 'one', 'who', 'never', 'read', 'novel']",N/A

When it was playing in theaters, I was about 14, and I managed to see it at least three times. Rob Reiner's direction is competent. James Caan's acting is surprisingly subdued. Even Richard Farnsworth, Lauren Bacall and Frances Sternhagen create sympathy for their barely shown characters.But, my God, Kathy Bates is brilliant, playing Annie as someone quirky, scary and even funny. William Goldman's script, which originally called for Annie to use a welding torch to remove Paul Sheldon's feet, does allow her the chance to go over the top, of course, but Bates' subtlety at key points in the film is what floors me. The little touches showing Annie watching ""Love Connection"" or dancing around to Liberace records. Through these scenes, Bates actually builds sympathy for Annie's character, her loneliness, her ""morality"" and her need to love a fictional character.As a viewer, I cared deeply for her, even after she went nuts, tied a man to a bed, took a sledgehammer to his legs, held him captive, let everyone around believe he was dead and then tried to shoot him to death.Kathy Bates has been uniformly great in films ever since this one, but this one is my favorite of hers.

156392,A2S02XWWNNHUIX,0792846338,C. E. Miles,"[2, 2]","I would find it hard to believe that too many people haven't seen this Stephen King classic, but if you haven't this is an absolute must see.  James Caan is a novelist struggling to make a break for the mold he has  been placed in because of the success of his series of romance novels based  on his character Misery. Caan goes on vacation in the mountains to finish  his newest book, which is supposed to an edgy break from his previous work.  After a terrible car accident Caan is rescued by Annie Wilkes (Played by  Kathy Bates), a seemingly kind and sweet nurse who offers to get him back  on his feet. Annie, as it turns out, is the world's biggest Misery fan, or  should I say the world's biggest deranged fan. What ensues is some of the  most shocking and frightening moments in cinema history. I promise that you  will be sitting on the edge of your seat for this entire movie, and there  will be times that you will not be able to watch.Kathy Bates deservedly  won an Oscar for her portrayal of the devoted ""Misery"" fan. Her swing from  one emotion to another is believable, and terrifyingly real. She does a  tremendous job of making her character seem like your average next door  neighbor, then like your worst nightmare. James Caan is perfect as the  writer held captive in the home of this obviously unbalanced woman. He  portrays a breadth of emotion as he tries to cope with his captivity. From  the apprehensive beginnings, to the desperate attempts at freedom, to his  eventual courage to fight back. (I also love the casting of Richard  Farnsworth as the local sheriff. Has he ever played a character you didn't  like?)Rob Reiner's direction is terrific and always keeps the action  moving even in the most intricate of scenes. You can see that he let's both  Caan and Bates play their respective roles, and move the film along like  the consummate professionals they are. The screenplay adapted from King's  novel is superb, and makes this movie a suspense classic. Of all of the  Stephen King novels that have been turned into big screen features, this  one is very true to the book, which is what gives it its intensity. If you  have never seen this movie, you really should, and if you haven't seen it  for a while pick up a copy.

Saxelid ""Bookworm""","[1, 1]","Misery was arguably Stephen King's most personal book, a nail biter of a story that explored the horrible effects of both his substance abuse and considerable fame on his life.  The story is Hitchcockian in its simplicity.  Paul Sheldon, a successful writer of gothic/historical romances, is celebrating.  He has killed off Misery, his romance series heroine, and written his first 'real' (i.e. literary) novel in years.  Then disaster strikes...his car slides off the road during a blizzard and, severely injured, he awakens bedridden in the home of Annie Wilkes, his &quot;Number One Fan.&quot;  Sheldon gradually becomes aware that the woman is dangerously unbalanced and has no intention of releasing him, ever.  The game of cat and mouse he must play with Annie will have you on the edge of your seat.  Rob Reiner keeps the suspense building and William Goldman's script is a delight (although the intimate insider look at a writer's creative process that King's novel had sadly cannot be communicated visually).  An essential in any King fans cinema library.  My only quibble with the disc (which offers both a full frame and widescreen presentation) is that the hilarious trailer featuring a Christmas from Hell narration (while 'The Little Drummer Boy' plays in background) is absent, the included teaser and trailer are both pretty much standard issue hostage thriller stuff.

And that in itself makes Kathy's character of Annie Wilkes one of the most disturbingly scary creations in cinema.Brilliantly adapted from Stephen Kings novel of the same name, `Misery' tells the story of acclaimed author Paul Sheldon who has just finished his latest novel, a departure from his collection of love stories involving a girl named Misery.  In the air or tradition Paul visits the same Inn he visits as he finishes every novel, but on his way home he is caught in a blizzard that causes him to wreck.  He would have died if it weren't for his number one fan who pulled him from his car and decided to take it upon herself to nurse him back to health.What at first seems like a kind gesture transforms into heated and violent obsession as Annie keeps Paul hostage in her home, leaving him crippled in his bed to write for her.  She insists that he writes her his masterpiece in dedication to her for saving his life.It's Bates performance that makes this a memorable film, genuinely thrilling and believable, and as the film progresses we see so many layers to her character, showing us what on the outset could be perceived as pure insanity but upon further study is more sheer depravation and loneliness.  I'm ecstatic that she won the Oscar for this.  Believe me when I say I'm a huge fan of Caan, but he has nothing on Bates electric performance.  I've never read King's novel, but I'm anxious to do so.

156399,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,0792846338,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[53, 60]","Misery is an exceedingly good adaptation of the original novel by Stephen King.  The novel features one of King's most tightly-wound, increasingly suspenseful tales, and this movie faithfully brings the novel to life on the big screen.  Paul Sheldon, America's best selling writer, creator of Misery Chastain and chronicler of her romantic and human struggles and successes, has just finished writing a ""serious"" novel he hopes will give him the stature he desires.  On his trip home with the manuscript, a fierce blizzard causes him to lose control of his car.  Annie Wilkes, his number one fan, finds his car at the bottom of a hill, pulls Sheldon out of it, and takes him home to nurse back to health.  As Sheldon begins to adjust to his new surroundings, he is increasingly bothered by his caregiver's erratic mood swings.  He soon finds himself a virtual prisoner in her house, essentially unable to move with his two mangled legs.  When Annie reads his brand new book, she is exceedingly unhappy with it.  When she gets the newly published Misery Chastain novel and finds out that her beloved Misty is dead, she begins unleashing her fury on Sheldon and insisting he resurrect Misty in a new novel written especially for her.  All this time, the small mountain town's husband-and-wife police force search for any sign of the missing author (albeit halfheartedly).  Eventually, Sheldon realizes escape is something only he can achieve for himself.James Caan is quite good as Paul Sheldon, but Kathy Bates simply is Annie Wilkes.  Her performance as this complicated, mentally disturbed super-fan broods over this entire movie, making it the riveting thriller it is.  Lauren Bacall, in what is an overlooked but rather amazing casting coup, lends her talents to the movie in the role of Sheldon's literary agent, while Richard Farnsworth and perennial King favorite Frances Sternhagen round out a truly excellent cast.  King actually held out on this project until such time as it could be placed in the more than capable hands of director Rob Reiner.  King had a special affection for this particular story, and he was not going to allow a second-rate adaptation of it to come to the big screen.The suspense of this story is basically psychological in nature, but there are two scenes of far more physical suffering.  The hobbling scene is memorable to say the least, and another incident toward the end introduces a little blood to the film, but overall this is a movie that all lovers of suspense and human drama can appreciate.  There are a lot of bad movies based on terrific Stephen King stories and novels, but this movie captures the powerful magic of the original novel as effectively as any King movie ever has.",5,It's more than great--it's perfect,1045440000,"02 17, 2003",2003,2725,"['Misery', 'exceedingly', 'good', 'adaptation', 'original', 'novel', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'one', 'King', 'most', 'tightly-wound', 'increasingly', 'suspenseful', 'tales', 'movie', 'faithfully', 'novel', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'America', 'best', 'selling', 'writer', 'creator', 'Misery', 'Chastain', 'chronicler', 'romantic', 'human', 'struggles', 'successes', 'just', 'finished', 'writing', 'serious', 'novel', 'will', 'give', 'stature', 'trip', 'home', 'manuscript', 'fierce', 'blizzard', 'lose', 'control', 'car', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'number', 'one', 'fan', 'car', 'bottom', 'hill', 'pulls', 'Sheldon', 'home', 'nurse', 'back', 'health', 'Sheldon', 'adjust', 'new', 'surroundings', 'increasingly', 'bothered', 'caregiver', 'erratic', 'mood', 'swings', 'soon', 'virtual', 'prisoner', 'house', 'essentially', 'unable', 'move', 'two', 'mangled', 'legs', 'When', 'Annie', 'brand', 'new', 'book', 'exceedingly', 'unhappy', 'When', 'newly', 'published', 'Misery', 'Chastain', 'novel', 'out', 'beloved', 'Misty', 'dead', 'unleashing', 'fury', 'Sheldon', 'insisting', 'resurrect', 'Misty', 'new', 'novel', 'written', 'especially', 'time', 'small', 'mountain', 'town', 'husband-and-wife', 'police', 'force', 'search', 'sign', 'missing', 'author', 'halfheartedly', 'Eventually', 'Sheldon', 'escape', 'something', 'only', 'can', 'achieve', 'himself.James', 'Caan', 'quite', 'good', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'simply', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'performance', 'complicated', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'super-fan', 'broods', 'entire', 'movie', 'making', 'riveting', 'thriller', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'what', 'overlooked', 'rather', 'amazing', 'casting', 'coup', 'talents', 'movie', 'role', 'Sheldon', 'literary', 'agent', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'perennial', 'King', 'favorite', 'Frances', 'Sternhagen', 'round', 'out', 'truly', 'excellent', 'cast', 'King', 'actually', 'held', 'out', 'project', 'such', 'time', 'could', 'be', 'placed', 'more', 'capable', 'hands', 'director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'King', 'had', 'special', 'affection', 'particular', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'allow', 'second-rate', 'adaptation', 'come', 'big', 'screen.The', 'suspense', 'story', 'basically', 'psychological', 'nature', 'are', 'two', 'scenes', 'far', 'more', 'physical', 'suffering', 'hobbling', 'scene', 'memorable', 'say', 'least', 'incident', 'end', 'little', 'blood', 'film', 'overall', 'movie', 'lovers', 'suspense', 'human', 'drama', 'can', 'appreciate', 'are', 'lot', 'bad', 'movies', 'based', 'terrific', 'Stephen', 'King', 'stories', 'novels', 'movie', 'powerful', 'magic', 'original', 'novel', 'as', 'effectively', 'King', 'movie', 'ever']",N/A
156400,A2GYX971VETQBV,0792846338,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[7, 8]","Set in a secluded town in the snow-capped mountains, James Caan and Kathy Bates battle wits as a popular romance novelist and his obsessed fan in this wonderful adaptation of Stephen King's novel.  MISERY achieves everything it sets out to achieve, proving once again that Stephen King is a master of writing suspenseful, entertaining tales that both chill and delight.  Rob Reiner transfers King's talent beautifully to the big screen and the film manages to pull-off its suspense without any real violence.  Well...that is...almost without gruesome violence.  Those who have seen the film already (or have only heard about it) will be familiar with the famous ""hobbling"" scene.  But the success of the violence in this picture absolutely requires the non-violent suspense that saturates the rest of the film.  In addition to nail-biting suspense, King has managed to write a writer into his story, giving the film a bit of autobiographical realism and intrigue.What drives MISERY is the quality of its two main actors, James Caan and Kathy Bates.  Caan is perfect as the tortured writer, but Kathy Bates takes the cake.  Her performance as a psychopathic nurse, who is affected by dual personalities, is electrifying.  One just never knows when she is going to snap and I found myself on the edge of my seat in every scene that she is in.  The truly scary realization is that as the film progresses one begins to see that her ""split"" personalities are actually not split at all, but rather two sides of the same coin, each capable of horrific evil.  In this vein, the ""battle"" between the smart writer and the dim-witted fan becomes much more interesting as we realize that Bates is not as dim-witted as we were initially led to believe.  Because MISERY is primarily a film between two actors set in a single home (and primarily one room, at that), the audience becomes involved in the claustrophobia of Caan's situation and our feelings of helplessness only add to the tension the film creates.  Finally, I couldn't help but make some subtle comparisons to DEATHTRAP, another film of mystery and suspense that centers on a writer in a secluded cabin who is forced to write for his life.  While DEATHTRAP may keep you guessing, MISERY keeps you on the edge of your seat.Overall, MISERY is pure entertainment and a pleasure to watch.

156404,A3UUGZRTBS81YN,0792846338,David W. Jones,"[4, 4]","This review is primarily for the blu-ray transfer and not so much the film itself.  The transfer is acceptable, with a good level of detail, although this is offset by a high degree of film grain.  Also, the colors are a bit washed out, including the darker tones.  This detracts slightly from the suspense of the film--greater contrast generally suits the psychological thriller genre well.  The quality of the visuals do not matter all that much, however, since most of the movie occurs in one room; there is not much in the way of scenic vistas or action.  So if you already own this on DVD, it is not worth upgrading in my opinion.  But if you do not already own it and find it for a good price (as I did), then it is worth it.As far as the movie itself, I will simply say that Kathy Bates earned her Academy Award for this performance.  Her character Annie Wilkes is deservedly listed as seventeenth on the all-time movie villain list by the American Film Institute.  Very suspenseful.

I wanted to see the film for a long time but being a MGM release, I did not know what to expect. MGM is not very reliable on relesing good-quality blu-rays and they do not have the resources to do appropiate restorations like other studios. Then, I read a review of the BD on Bluray.com and the reviewer gave high marks to picture and audio quality and Amazon lowered the price to $6.00. It was an offer I couldn't refuse.Misery is a great film adaptation thanks to the source material, Rob Reiner's direction and the fantastic performances of Kathy Bates and James Caan. Bates is perfect as the psycothic Annie Wilkes and is a pleasure to watch her transform from a nursing lady into a maniacal person. She really earned her Oscar. James Caan is equally impressive in a role that demanded him to be in bed long periods of time. The movie is tense, scary, dramatic and also funny and that's what make it a classic thriller.Picture and Audio:Misery comes to Blu-Ray looking great. Textures, skin-tones and detail is clean and sharp. There some flickering in some scenes but nothing distracting. A great transfer through and through.The 5.1 Dts-HD MA is not that spectacular but serves the film right. Being a dialogue heavy film, don't expect this to bang the house but the mix serves the film right. Every sound is crisp and crystal clear.Extras:The bad news is that all the extras are on the DVD disc. The BD has none. While that may improve picture and audio quality, at least they should've include the audiocomentaries to go along with the picture.Anyway, the DVD has some good amount of bonus features: Two audiomentaries, a making-of feauterette, a conversation with composer Marc Shaiman, stalkers profiles, advice to stalked people, a diagnosis on Annie Wilkes and two theatrical trailers.Closing Thoughts:Misery remains a classic of horror thanks to the amazing novel that comes from and the excellent cast and crew that went to make the picture. Unlike many MGM titles, the Blu-Ray features excellent picture & sound. The only downside is that all the extras are on the DVD but at least they gave us bonus material.

In the past when I've read a book and then seen the movie version of that book, I've been disappointed in who was selected to play the leads.  For example, in the movie, ""An Interview with a Vampire"", I thought Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and Antonio Banderas were totally wrong for their respective roles and it ruined the movie for me.  That, and turning a horror book into a comedy ruined it, too.But in this movie, I thought Kathy Bates absolutely nailed the part of psychotic No. 1 fan, Annie Wilkes.  In the book, Annie is portrayed as both nurturing and cruel...and without warning or much provocation.  In this movie, Bates does an excellent job of changing her facial expressions from loving to raging mad within seconds.I also loved how she could dish out the most insanely cruel punishments, but act like a wise schoolteacher while doing it...with the attitude that this is for his own good.However, although I thought Bates nailed her part, I thought James Caan did a very weak impression of the tortured writer (both literally and figuratively), Paul Sheldon.Bates was giving her A-game here and Caan seemed kind of lethargic...when he should've been acting scared out of his wits, but trying to play it cool so as not to set off one of her psychotic spells.If you've read the book, I should warn you that many of the scenes are different from the book.  For example, in the book, Sheldon is addicted to the pain killers, but in the movie, he's not and instead stores them to poison her.The book is also WAY more gruesome than the movie.  For example, in the book, Wilkes kills one character by mowing his head with a lawn mower.  But in the movie, she simply shoots this character with a gun.Overall, I was very pleased with Kathy Bates' performance, disappointed with James Caan's performance, and pleased that this movie turned out similarly to how I pictured the scenes would be in the book.",5,Maybe having a number 1 fan isn't such a good thing,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,1956,"['seeing', 'movie', 'had', 'also', 'read', 'book', 'past', 'when', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'then', 'seen', 'movie', 'version', 'book', ""'ve"", 'been', 'disappointed', 'who', 'was', 'selected', 'play', 'leads', 'example', 'movie', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'thought', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'were', 'totally', 'wrong', 'respective', 'roles', 'ruined', 'movie', 'turning', 'horror', 'book', 'comedy', 'ruined', 'movie', 'thought', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'absolutely', 'nailed', 'part', 'psychotic', 'No', '1', 'fan', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'book', 'Annie', 'portrayed', 'nurturing', 'cruel', 'warning', 'much', 'provocation', 'movie', 'Bates', 'excellent', 'job', 'changing', 'facial', 'expressions', 'loving', 'raging', 'mad', 'seconds.I', 'also', 'loved', 'how', 'could', 'dish', 'out', 'most', 'insanely', 'cruel', 'punishments', 'act', 'wise', 'schoolteacher', 'doing', 'attitude', 'own', 'good.However', 'thought', 'Bates', 'nailed', 'part', 'thought', 'James', 'Caan', 'did', 'very', 'weak', 'impression', 'tortured', 'writer', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'Paul', 'Sheldon.Bates', 'was', 'giving', 'A-game', 'here', 'Caan', 'seemed', 'kind', 'lethargic', 'when', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'acting', 'scared', 'wits', 'trying', 'play', 'cool', 'so', 'not', 'set', 'off', 'one', 'psychotic', 'spells.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'should', 'warn', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'different', 'book', 'example', 'book', 'Sheldon', 'addicted', 'pain', 'killers', 'movie', 'not', 'instead', 'stores', 'poison', 'her.The', 'book', 'also', 'WAY', 'more', 'gruesome', 'movie', 'example', 'book', 'Wilkes', 'one', 'character', 'mowing', 'head', 'lawn', 'mower', 'movie', 'simply', 'shoots', 'character', 'gun.Overall', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'performance', 'disappointed', 'James', 'Caan', 'performance', 'pleased', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'similarly', 'how', 'pictured', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'book']",N/A

156439,A19JYLHD94K94D,0792846338,Itamar Katz,"[0, 0]","Both Stephen King and Rob Reiner have lost much of their charm for me in the past fifteen years, but in 1990 they were still in top enough form to create this masterpiece. Having struck gold in 1986 with his memorable adaptation of King's Stand By Me, Reiner made another attempt at the works of the successful suspense artist, and brought along for the task screenwriter William Goldman, with whom he worked before on the film version of Goldman's own novel The Princess Bride (Goldman would later adapt King twice more, somewhat less successfully, with Hearts In Atlantis and Dreamcatcher).King's writing is clearly at its best when he keeps the supernatural to a minimum; the stark reality is what made Stand By Me powerful, and it worked even better in Misery. Not only does King keep things frighteningly realistic in this story - it's also clearly semi-autobiographical - not, of course, that he was actually kidnapped by a crazed fan, but King's experiences with over zealous fans of his work clearly seeps into the story, and like in The Shining, King writes best when he writes about writers. James Caan does a more than adapt job of playing the bitter, King-ish author Paul Sheldon; master-adapter Goldman (whose credits also include Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, All The President's Men and Marathon Man) did a fantastic job of translating the book into the big screen.As good a job as Reiner, Goldman and Caan did, this film clearly belongs to Hollywood newcomer Kathy Bates, who won a much deserved Oscar for the role of Annie Wilkes (over old-timers Meryl Streep and Anjelica Huston). Bates is brilliant, frightening and sympathetic in the role which remains the defining role of her acclaimed career, and she makes the character come alive like no other actress could have, proving that being blonde and skinny is not what makes a great actress. Annie Wilkes remains one of the most memorable villains in cinema history, and for good reasons. Caan is excellent in his part, and praise should also go to supporting actors Lauren Bacall and Richard Farnsworth (The Straight Story), but Bates steals the show from all of them.Thanks to Kathy Bates' masterful performance and Rob Reiner's wonderful direction, Misery is one of the most powerful and frightening thrillers in cinema history. If anyone needed proof that Reiner was capable of serious dramatic films and not just quotable cult comedies like This Is Spinal Tap and When Harry Met Sally, Misery proved that point, although it doesn't lack in its own quotable one-liners. It's a strong, realistic horror film that doesn't let go.

Caan stars as Paul Sheldon, a very successful author of the ""Misery Chastain"" series of books.  After finishing his latest installment of his series, he sets off to deliver the manuscript to his editor.  Unfortunately, he encounters a terrible snowstorm, and his car slides off the road and over a cliff.  He is trapped inside with numerous injuries and unable to escape.Fortunately for Paul, Annie Wilkes (Bates) comes along and pries his car door open with a crowbar and frees him.  Annie takes Paul to her house to nurse him back to health.  As Paul is beginning to convalesce, Annie reveals that she is his ""number one fan"", and has read every book in the Misery series several times over.  She also has authgraphed pictures of Paul throughout her house.  At first, Paul is flattered by Annie's kindness, but he also suspects something is wrong with this good samaritan.Annie also managed to retrieve Paul's manuscript from the wreckage, and she begs Paul to let her read it.  After a while, he relents.  But after reading it, Annie goes completely nuts because Paul has killed off Misery.  Paul now realizes that Annie is insane and the only way for him to survive is to give in to her wishes and write a new novel which brings Misery back to life.Meanwhile, the local sheriff (Farnsworth) has become aware of Paul's disappearance and has begun an investigation into his whereabouts.Paul continues to work on his new novel and as he writes, he's realizing that he's creating his best work yet.  However, he still has Annie to deal with.  He's continually locked up in his room, but he does manage to unlock his door by using a paper clip in the lock.  He discovers many things about Annie, including her scrapbook, which has newpaper clippings implicating her in a hospital baby death scandal.Unfortunately for Paul, Annie figures out that he has been out of his room, and she takes measures to ensure he won't leave again, courtesy of a piece of wood and a large sledgehammer.  Will Paul be able to escape?  Will the sheriff uncover the truth about Annie before its too late?This is an excellent movie.  The plot is thrilling and will keep you on edge throughout the movie.  James Caan and Richard Farnsworth give solid performances, but Kathy Bates is truly the star of this film.  Her portrayal of the obsessed ""number one fan"" is impeccable.

He is tired of  writing the Misery novels, and in the eight one, he decides to kill her  off. After finishing his new untitled novel at a Colorado lodge, he heads  out on the winding Colorado road that will soon take him to New York.

However, a middle-aged woman named Annie Wilkes sees Paul's car on the side  of the road and brings him back to her farm. But little does Paul know that  the fate ahead of him may be worse than death...Kathy Bates gives the  performance of a lifetime as the unforgettable Annie Wilkes, and James Cahn  gives an equally strong performance.

I also love the part during the high-impact climactic scene between Annie and Paul when she maliciously called him a: c-o-c-k sucker. OMG so funny!!IMHO, ""Misery"" is an updated version of the classic ""What Ever Happened To Baby Jane"" because Annie is just as nutty and attention-starved as Baby Jane Hudson. I don't think she had a specific obsession with Paul, instead, I think she was just obsessed with the idea of being near a warm body. She would have done this to anyone! But, Paul was absolutely the perfect victim to be kept hostage because he was such a normal, sane person who would never otherwise have been caught dead (pardon the pun) with Annie Wilkes.Kathy Bates very rightfully won the Academy Award for her portrayal of this whack-job. She did such a bang-up job. As a matter of fact, there's even times when I'm watching ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" (another favorite of mine) when I actually think for a split second that I see Annie Wilkes return!

156461,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,0792846338,"John ""MovieAddict""","[0, 0]","I particularly enjoy one scene in &quot;Misery,&quot; in which the crazed fan of a successful author switches from kind, gentle woman to crazy lunatic after she reads his latest novel in his line of Misery books, about an inspirational woman from the 1800s. The fan finds out he has killed her favorite fictional character off. &quot;You dirty birdy!&quot; she yells. Right here lies the strength in &quot;Misery&quot;: its ability to take a good novel and turn it into a great film, by deep characters with waves of emotions and excellent lines of dialogue.Kathy Bates is the crazed fan of James Caan's fluent writer, Paul Sheldon, who has finally ended his Misery series. In the beginning, we see him telling Lauren Bacall that Misery has ruined his life. He has been type-cast, not able to write anything but Misery novels. So he has killed her off in his latest book, and set to work on a new novel, &quot;Untitled&quot; (which, in the novel Misery--the REAL novel--is named &quot;Fast Cars&quot;).Paul retreats to a cabin in the middle of nowhere, writes his new novel with a sense of joy, and checks out of the cabin he is staying in. On the way home to the big city, unproduced novel in hand, he crashes off the edge of a ravine and flips his car. This is credited to both the winter storm and his drunkness from a bottle of Dom Periogne.He awakens days later to find himself in the care of Annie Wilkes (Bates). Everything is nice and dandy at first. Annie is a nice enough person. She tells him the roads are closed and the telephone lines are down, but she will take him to town when they clear up. She says she has called Paul's agent and has told his agent where he is.But soon Paul realizes he is trapped in the house with a madwoman. She is nice one second, a lunatic the next. And the best thing about this is how well Kathy Bates carries the character.I read the novel &quot;Misery&quot; by Stephen King. It is the only book of his I have read that I have enjoyed. (I hate his other work.) And something tells me that King thought of this idea of a writer trapped with a crazy fan because he himself is an author, most likely adorned with letters signed by mad fans every day. But would his fans be crazy enough to kidnap King, abuse him when he's bad, and make him suffer endlessly? The fan, thinking, in the fan's deranged mind, that they are serving God?So King wrote about this idea, and Rob Reiner turned it into a film a coupl'a years later. I personally enjoy the film a bit more than the novel.In the book, I imagined Kathy Bates the whole time as Annie Wilkes. Only I didn't imagine Kathy Bates herself, but rather the woman Kathy Bates plays. You see, Kathy Bates doesn't play Kathy Bates here. Kathy Bates plays Annie Wilkes.  She steals the show. She completely evelops her character. She easily switches her moods as if there is an on and off switch.I cannot imagine anyone for the role of Annie other than Kathy Bates herself.&quot;Misery&quot; is at times humorous, at times amusing, at times scary, and at times truly appalling; but it is always an excellent thriller. Reiner spotted the potential in the book in 1989, and he immediately went to work on the film for a 1990 release. In fact, I can imagine Rob Reiner scrolling through King's novel, fascinated by every page, wanting to turn it into a blockbuster film with big stars and big thrills.And then I can imagine Rob Reiner at the premiere of &quot;Misery.&quot; I can see the credits rolling.

156463,A3OH101U0CPUC7,0792846338,Joseph Boone,"[1, 1]","This movie tells the story of author Paul Sheldon after a car crash has shattered his legs and a retired nurse named Annie Wilkes takes him to her home to recover. Unfortunately, for Paul, the esteemed Miss Wilkes is crazy as a loon and it becomes obvious pretty quickly that he's a prisoner, not a patient or a guest. I don't want to give away much of the plot, but she coerces him into writing a new novel just for her. One that will resurrect a character that Annie loves but that Paul had killed in his latest book. Paul's struggles with Annie to survive, write the book, keep his sanity, and escape are what form the core of the story.There have been so many mediocre to poor adaptations of Stephen King books that one tends to expect that any movie based on his work will be a waste of time.  Misery is the rare exception that proves the rule because this is a taut, suspenseful movie.  Kathy Bates won an Oscar for her portrayal of Annie Wilkes and she deserved it.  Annie is truly insane and Bates nailed the transitions from the sweet and caring Annie to the psycho screamer with a hair trigger in a way that seemed so natural it's unlikely many actresses could have matched it.  James Caan is equally good as the tortured Paul Sheldon even if his part is less compelling.  Richard Farnsworth also has a nice supporting role in the movie as the town sheriff even if it is an addition to the book.Misery is a riveting movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you squirm at the same time.  As sadistic as this version of Annie is, the violence has actually been toned down from the book, but it's extremely intense all the same.  This is not a gore splashed slasher film, but the tension between Annie and Paul is sky high and there is one scene, in particular, that is tough to watch.  I don't recommend this for the faint of heart, but anyone else should dive in and enjoy one of the very best adaptations of the modern master of horror.",5,Excellent adaption of one of King's best,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,1964,"['movie', 'story', 'author', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'car', 'crash', 'shattered', 'legs', 'retired', 'nurse', 'named', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'home', 'recover', 'Unfortunately', 'Paul', 'esteemed', 'Miss', 'Wilkes', 'crazy', 'loon', 'obvious', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'prisoner', 'not', 'patient', 'guest', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'much', 'plot', 'writing', 'new', 'novel', 'just', 'One', 'will', 'resurrect', 'character', 'Annie', 'Paul', 'had', 'killed', 'latest', 'book', 'Paul', 'struggles', 'Annie', 'survive', 'write', 'book', 'keep', 'sanity', 'escape', 'are', 'what', 'form', 'core', 'story.There', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'many', 'mediocre', 'poor', 'adaptations', 'Stephen', 'King', 'books', 'one', 'expect', 'movie', 'based', 'work', 'will', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'Misery', 'rare', 'exception', 'rule', 'taut', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'won', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'deserved', 'Annie', 'truly', 'insane', 'Bates', 'nailed', 'transitions', 'sweet', 'caring', 'Annie', 'psycho', 'screamer', 'hair', 'trigger', 'way', 'seemed', 'so', 'natural', 'unlikely', 'many', 'actresses', 'could', 'have', 'matched', 'James', 'Caan', 'equally', 'good', 'tortured', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'even', 'part', 'less', 'compelling', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'also', 'nice', 'supporting', 'role', 'movie', 'town', 'sheriff', 'even', 'addition', 'book.Misery', 'riveting', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'make', 'squirm', 'same', 'time', 'As', 'sadistic', 'version', 'Annie', 'violence', 'actually', 'been', 'toned', 'down', 'book', 'extremely', 'intense', 'same', 'not', 'gore', 'splashed', 'slasher', 'film', 'tension', 'Annie', 'Paul', 'sky', 'high', 'one', 'scene', 'particular', 'tough', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'faint', 'heart', 'anyone', 'else', 'should', 'dive', 'enjoy', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'adaptations', 'modern', 'master', 'horror']",N/A

156465,AEGLF0F0I36QW,0792846338,kcstrawberryblonde,"[1, 7]","HUGE comedown from the book. You'll hardly recognize it.I'm an RN who could kiss Stephen King for bringing public attention to the very real problem of evil-sometimes killer- nurses, who are either sociopathic or narcotic addicted, and still working in healthcare.Still,the movie is soooo disappointing. There are several parts that don't add up but James Caan's Golden Razzie-worthy performance is what completely ruins it.Bates nails it in one scene, as she depicts how someone with Anti-Social Personality Disorder thinks while they commit a pre-meditated, violent crime.(Anti Social Personality Disorder is better known as ""sociopath"" and ""psychopath"".) Yet, it annoys me that so many people who saw the movie are surprised and wide-eyed by the fact that a true sociopath would look just like you and I, and would act like everything was normal as s/he performed the most evil deeds imaginable.Repulsed by the things Annie did to her victim,yes.Definitely.But IMHO it shouldn't SURPRISE people. That's what ASPDs/sociopaths/psychopaths-whatever you call them-can really do. That's what people who abuse enough narcotics can do. Apparently a lot of people need to wake up and smell the coffee: ""People"" completely devoid of a conscience, who could sleep like a baby and expect the victim to be their friend after doing what Annie Wilkes did, are everywhere in society.They don't all attack people with axes or mallets but if they did they'd never feel a shred of guilt or concern for the victim.It wouldn't faze them to ruin your life for giving them a funny look. They've just learned to try to hide the way they're really wired. If you haven't seen them you should have because they've seen you.There's probably one on your block and one in your workplace. But I digress... :) Bates' portrayal of how a true sociopath can act was excellent, but she was disappointing in other scenes. If Annie Wilkes is a narcotics abuser, in many ways Bates looks and acts NOTHING like the real thing. When the man she's smitten and obsessed with asks her to have dinner with him, what woman answers in a monotone? LOLI didn't expect all of the mind games and psychological warfare that goes on between the hero and villain in the book to be communicated in the movie but was disappointed that more of it wasn't. I thought that was the main point of the story. Silly me.In the book we get to know Paul Sheldon, the hero, intimately. We also learn the complex ways Annie Wilkes(Bates), the villain, operates. Sheldon is a well-known writer. Wilkes is an extremely disturbed and evil fan who is obsessed with Sheldon and has been stalking him. When he's in a car crash she kidnaps him from the site and takes him to a deserted house. In the book we learn the way Sheldon handles crises, his past successes and failures, his admirable and annoying traits. In the book he's so real that it felt like really being there. And in the book King is brilliant as he takes Sheldon through the whole gamut of emotions we would expect from someone who's been in a serious car crash, kidnapped from the crash while critically injured, and held prisoner by someone who verbally, physically, and psychologically tortures them in isolation for six months. Where was ANY of that in the movie? Again, I thought the whole story was supposed to be about a villain who is an evil genius and her kidnapped victim who is SO intelligent and able to hold it together that he has a chance, even though the odds are greatly stacked against him.Instead of portraying that, Caan acts like he thought he was supposed to be portraying Wile E. Coyote. In one scene where the villain horribly abuses and tortures him, Caan writhes and yells twice and then voila! Half a minute later he's good as new a la your favorite cartoon character. He didn't even break a sweat! In another Annie Wilkes forces him to destroy the manuscript that he had worked on for years and was his pride and joy, AND was not yet in writing anywhere else. Caan questions her once. When she insists he kind of sticks out his lip and looks a little bit miffed and pouty for a few seconds. That's it? I don't THINK so, James.Near the end Caan needs a bath and some clean clothes but otherwise looks like he just got back from a spa! Miraculously his emotions are still rock solid.(Uh Huh. Riiight.)That's fortunate because he needs to make a nervy and dramatic escape attempt or be murdered by the villain. I think he creases his brow once during his escape attempt. If his hair moved at all it wasn't much. Between you and I, he didn't look like he'd missed many meals during his captivity. Whatever.There's still another scene at the very end that's bogus as it can be and an insult to people who've really lived through a certain medical problem. I won't tell you the ending but my advice is to read the book and skip the movie.To see a performance by Bates that's excellent through the whole movie, I recommend ""Fried Green Tomatoes."" To see a good one  by Caan, I recommend ""The Godfather."" If you want to read about real-life versions of Annie Wilkes I recommend ""Nurses Who Kill"" by Clifford Linedecker and William A. Burt.",2,Read the book but don't waste your time seeing the movie.,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",2012,5156,"['HUGE', 'comedown', 'book', ""'ll"", 'hardly', 'recognize', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'RN', 'who',

I hope this didn't qualify us as stalkers, but we also visited fameous Bettes Book Store in hopes of the possibility of seeing Mr. King (which we did not).

I was pleased initially, but even more pleased after I watched it. I don't think I was old enough when I watched it the first time to really appreciate this film.

156474,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0792846338,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 7]","By now pretty much everybody knows the rule that the best movies made from Stephen King novels do not put his name above the title and do not trumpet the fact in the trailer.  This would be film's like &quot;Stand By Me,&quot; &quot;The Shawshank Redemption,&quot; &quot;The Green Mile,&quot; and, of course, &quot;Misery.&quot;  Director Rob Reiner did the first and last films on that list, so he would know.  The idea in this 1990 film is fairly simple and one that obviously would send shivers up and down King's own spine: what if an author became the captive of his &quot;number one fan,&quot; who, needless to say, is a psychotic maniac?Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is a famous writer, who has been turning out historical bodice rippers about a heroine named Misery Chastain.  As was the case with Arthur Conan Doyle, who killed off Sherlock Holmes at one point, and Edgar Rice Burroughs, who tried to kill off Tarzan's Jane, Sheldon has enough of his fictional creation and has killed her off in a book about to hit the stands.  Meanwhile he has just finished a new novel about the slums in which he grew up that he hopes will establish his reputation as a serious writer.  However, after he leaves the secluded Colorado Hotel where he goes to write his books his car crashes during a snowstorm and he is horribly hurt.  But before he dies he is taken from his car and when he awakes he finds himself in a bed, both of his legs broken, and in the care of Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), a nurse who gleefully informs Paul that she is his &quot;number one fan.&quot;Grateful to be alive and believing Annie's story that they are snowed in and that the phone lines are down because of the storm, Paul recuperates.  He even lets Annie read his new manuscript, a privilege reserved for his editor, agent, and anybody who saves his life.  But Annie does not like Paul's new novel and when she discovers he has killed off Misery she goes off the deep end.  It becomes clear to Paul that if he has any hope of getting out of there alive, he is going to have to bow to dictates of his &quot;number one fan&quot; and bring Misery Chastain back from the grave.Meanwhile, Paul's agent (Lauren Bacall) has called up the local sheriff (Richard Farnsworth) and alerted him to the fact that the writer, on his way to New York with a new manuscript, has disappeared.  With the help of his plucky wife (Frances Sternhagen), the sheriff starts to search for Paul, who is trying to find some way of getting away from Annie, even in his hobbled condition.  Unfortunately, the more he learns about Annie, the less he likes his prospects and the more desperate his condition becomes.The original novel had a great irony in that under Annie's stern editorial guidance Paul is rather mortified to find the new Misery novel he is writing is the best thing he has ever done.  But with William Goldman's script the novel he is writing is but a small part of the game of cat and mouse between Annie and Paul.  Once it becomes clear Annie is insane Paul faces the daunting task of keeping on the slippery slope of her good side.  Besides, Goldman knows that the whole bit that King did in the novel with Paul's typewriter, which keeps losing keys as his work goes along, would not translate to the film, so he did not even try.This film represented the second time King created a female character who would be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, the difference being that Kathy Bates won for &quot;Misery&quot; whereas Sissy Spacek did not for &quot;Carrie.&quot;  While Caan turns in a solid performance as a character bound to a bed or wheelchair for most of the film, ultimately it is Bates who makes this film work with the way that she goes from sweet to sour on the drop of a pin.  Annie's is a many faceted lunacy and part of the terror is that Paul never knows which one will come walking through the door or back out of it again.  &quot;Misery&quot; struck me as being a flip on &quot;The Exorcist&quot; in that instead of being afraid of what we would find when we walked through the door, this time we were afraid of what was going to open the door and walk through.&quot;Misery&quot; is a relatively simple and rather intimate horror film.  This time King's monster is a human being and that makes Annie Wilkes one of the scariest, especially as she is played by Bates.  When you think of all the fine cinematic performances Bates has turned in since then, especially in &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; and &quot;Primary Colors,&quot; you have to be glad that Bette Midler turned down the role of Annie when it was offered to her.",5,"&quot;She can't be dead, MISERY CHASTAIN CANNOT BE DEAD!&quot;",1087603200,"06 19, 2004",2004,4612,"['now', 'pretty', 'much', 'everybody', 'rule', 'best', 'movies', 'made', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novels', 'do', 'not', 'put', 'name', 'title', 'do', 'not', 'trumpet', 'fact', 'trailer', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'quot', 'Stand', 'Me', 'quot', 'quot', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'quot', 'quot', 'Green', 'Mile', 'quot', 'course', 'quot', 'Misery.', 'quot', 'Director', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'did', 'first', 'last', 'films', 'list', 'would', 'know', 'idea', '1990', 'film', 'fairly', 'simple', 'one', 'obviously', 'would', 'send', 'shivers', 'up', 'King', 'own', 'spine', 'what', 'author', 'became', 'captive', 'quot', 'number', 'one', 'fan', 'quot', 'who', 'needless', 'say', 'psychotic', 'maniac', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'James', 'Caan', 'famous', 'writer', 'who', 'been', 'turning', 'out', 'historical', 'bodice', 'rippers', 'heroine', 'named', 'Misery', 'Chastain', 'was', 'case', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'who', 'killed', 'off', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'one', 'point', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'who', 'tried', 'kill', 'off', 'Tarzan', 'Jane', 'Sheldon', 'enough', 'fictional', 'creation', 'killed', 'off', 'book', 'hit', 'stands', 'Meanwhile', 'just', 'finished', 'new', 'novel', 'slums', 'grew', 'up', 'will', 'establish', 'reputation', 'serious', 'writer', 'However', 'secluded', 'Colorado', 'Hotel', 'where', 'write', 'books', 'car', 'crashes', 'snowstorm', 'horribly', 'hurt', 'taken', 'car', 'when', 'bed', 'legs', 'broken', 'care', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'nurse', 'who', 'gleefully', 'Paul', 'quot', 'number', 'one', 'fan.', 'quot', 'Grateful', 'be', 'alive', 'believing', 'Annie', 'story', 'are', 'snowed', 'phone', 'lines', 'are', 'down', 'storm', 'Paul', 'even', 'Annie', 'read', 'new', 'manuscript', 'privilege', 'reserved', 'editor', 'agent', 'anybody', 'who', 'life', 'Annie', 'not', 'Paul', 'new', 'novel', 'when', 'killed', 'off', 'Misery', 'deep', 'end', 'clear', 'Paul', 'hope', 'getting', 'alive', 'going', 'have', 'bow', 'dictates', 'quot', 'number', 'one', 'fan', 'quot', 'bring', 'Misery', 'Chastain', 'back', 'grave.Meanwhile', 'Paul', 'agent', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'called', 'up', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Richard', 'Farnsworth', 'alerted', 'fact', 'writer', 'way', 'New', 'York', 'new', 'manuscript', 'disappeared', 'help', 'plucky', 'wife', 'Frances', 'Sternhagen', 'sheriff', 'search', 'Paul', 'who', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'getting', 'away', 'Annie', 'even', 'hobbled', 'condition', 'Unfortunately', 'more', 'Annie', 'less', 'prospects', 'more', 'desperate', 'condition', 'original', 'novel', 'had', 'great', 'irony', 'Annie', 'stern', 'editorial', 'guidance', 'Paul', 'rather', 'mortified', 'find', 'new', 'Misery', 'novel', 'writing', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'done', 'William', 'Goldman', 'script', 'novel', 'writing', 'small', 'part', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Annie', 'Paul', 'clear', 'Annie', 'insane', 'Paul', 'daunting', 'task', 'keeping', 'slippery', 'slope', 'good', 'side', 'Goldman', 'whole', 'bit', 'King', 'did', 'novel', 'Paul', 'typewriter', 'losing', 'keys', 'work', 'along', 'would', 'not', 'translate', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'try.This', 'film', 'represented', 'second', 'time', 'King', 'created', 'female', 'character', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'difference', 'being', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'won', 'quot', 'Misery', 'quot', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'did', 'not', 'quot', 'Carrie.', 'quot', 'Caan', 'solid', 'performance', 'character', 'bound', 'bed', 'wheelchair', 'most', 'film', 'ultimately', 'Bates', 'who', 'film', 'work', 'way', 'sweet', 'sour', 'drop', 'pin', 'Annie', 'many', 'faceted', 'lunacy', 'part', 'terror', 'Paul', 'never', 'one', 'will', 'come', 'walking', 'door', 'back', 'again', 'quot', 'Misery', 'quot', 'struck', 'being', 'flip', 'quot', 'Exorcist', 'quot', 'instead', 'being', 'afraid', 'what', 'would', 'find', 'when', 'walked', 'door', 'time', 'were', 'afraid', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'open', 'door', 'walk', 'through.', 'quot', 'Misery', 'quot', 'relatively', 'simple', 'rather', 'intimate', 'horror', 'film', 'time', 'King', 'monster', 'human', 'being', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'one', 'scariest', 'especially', 'played', 'Bates', 'When', 'think', 'fine', 'cinematic', 'performances', 'Bates', 'turned', 'then', 'especially', 'quot', 'Dolores', 'Claiborne', 'quot', 'quot', 'Primary', 'Colors', 'quot', 'have', 'be', 'glad', 'Bette', 'Midler', 'turned', 'down', 'role', 'Annie', 'when', 'was', 'offered']",N/A

Like Stanley  Kubrick's version of the Stephen King novel, &quot;The Shining&quot;,  Misery is a good movie but the general &quot;feel&quot; of it, is that it  wasn't created with the book in mind. The characters don't have the same  &quot;feel&quot; as the written characters in this movie, but some aspects  of the film are actually better.For instance, Kathy Bates performance as  the estranged fan of #1 Bestselling novelist, Paul Sheldon, was absolutely  stunning. Never have I been so attracted, and repulsed, by the same  character. The &quot;split-personality&quot; aspect of her character is  spookily realistic, as anyone who has studied various mental illnesses will  know. In fact, her deranged-one-moment, sweet-as-pie-the-next personality  is definately the scariest thing in the movie, and not so much the  atrocities she commits.James Caan does an excellent job of not only  portraying a wounded man, but also of portraying a man living under  brutally truamatic conditions. (Note: the anticlimax of this movie was  great, too. &quot;Paul&quot; seemed genuinely affected by craziness he had  been put through)If you are looking for a good way to spend a sluggish  evening, you might want to consider seeing &quot;Misery&quot;. Considering  the story-line, the &quot;blood and injuries&quot; aspect of the film is  definately not overdone.

156480,A1TWTULVD6F22O,0792846338,"L. Quido ""quidrock""","[3, 4]","I have always felt the underappreciated film, ""Misery"", from King's novel of the same name, was akin to some of the best of his films (and so many of the films made from his novels are drek!). I do think that the film would have profited from a better actor in the lead role of Paul Sheldon (Nicholson is said to have turned it down....DeNiro would have been a great choice, but my personal favorite was Kevin Kline, who also turned it down), but the casting of James Caan just gave us more ability to focus on Kathy Bates, a journeyman actress who had been in at least a dozen films before Misery launched her career. And Caan turns in a worthy performance.King puts a modern day twist on the same kind of captivity and obsession that Fowles dealt with in his book, ""The Collector"".  The title of this movie and also King's book is ironic.  Misery, of course, is the name of the popular character in the Paul Sheldon (James Caan) series of books; he's a successful novelist with a romantic heroine he's grown tired of (Misery Chastain) and is killing off in his newest book, as yet unpublished (sort of like Patricia Cornwell with Kay Scarpetta...and while PC hasn't killed KS yet, one hopes she will, and soon) And misery (without the capital M) is exactly what he gets for having encountered Annie Wilkes, a psychopath immortalized by Bates. Injured and alone, Sheldon is made a virtual prisoner by his ""number one fan"".The audience is uneasy....if Hitchcock had directed, the uneasiness would have grown into fear a lot sooner, but Reiner, a good director that's a little out of his genre here, invokes realism instead of symbolism to point to all the signs of an impending Annie breakdown. Even those who had not read the novel will be hit over the head by the clues Annie leaves to what will happen when she finishes his new book. It's the one element of the film that prevents it, in my opinion, from being truly great. There's a background story going on about the sheriff, his wife and Sheldon's publicist trying to find him. It's well kept in the background and necessary to inject realism into what is happening to Paul.How Annie and Paul revenge themselves on each other is something you will recoil from, as you watch the film.Bates is stunning in her role, won every award in filmmaking for it, and has gone on to be our most memorable character actress. Reiner and Caan (especially Caan, who resuscitated his post-Godfather career with this) also contributed heavily to the very real life tragedy of the stalking/obsessive phenomena that famous people sometimes have to live with. There are also a lot of bloopers in the film, most of which I think Reiner left in as sort of a signpost to see who would pick up on them. My favorite Reiner-ism is the video of ""Harry Met Sally""...a Reiner film that is clearly visible on one of Annie's trips to the local store.And the film is chock full of memorable quotes, that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.  I leave you with one, from Bates as Annie, at the height of her madness:""Oh, This whole house is going to be full of romance, OOOH, I am going to put on my Liberace records.""Add it to your collection, it's a memorable thriller.",5,"The worst kind of ""Misery"" is the best kind of movie....",1128902400,"10 10, 2005",2005,3211,"['have', 'always', 'felt', 'underappreciated', 'film', 'Misery', 'King', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'was', 'akin', 'best', 'films', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'made', 'novels', 'are', 'drek', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'profited', 'better', 'actor', 'lead', 'role', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'Nicholson', 'said', 'have', 'turned', 'down', '.DeNiro', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'choice', 'personal', 'favorite', 'was', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'who', 'also', 'turned', 'down', 'casting', 'James', 'Caan', 'just', 'gave', 'more', 'ability', 'focus', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'journeyman', 'actress', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'least', 'dozen', 'films', 'Misery', 'launched', 'career', 'Caan', 'worthy', 'performance.King', 'modern', 'day', 'twist', 'same', 'kind', 'captivity', 'obsession', 'Fowles', 'book', 'Collector', 'title', 'movie', 'also', 'King', 'book', 'ironic', 'Misery', 'course', 'name', 'popular', 'character', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'James', 'Caan', 'series', 'books', 'successful', 'novelist', 'romantic', 'heroine', 'grown', 'tired', 'Misery', 'Chastain', 'killing', 'off', 'newest', 'book', 'yet', 'unpublished', 'sort', 'Patricia', 'Cornwell', 'Kay', 'Scarpetta', 'PC', ""n't"", 'killed', 'KS', 'yet', 'one', 'will', 'soon', 'misery', 'capital', 'M', 'exactly', 'what', 'having', 'encountered', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'psychopath', 'immortalized', 'Bates', 'Injured', 'alone', 'Sheldon', 'made', 'virtual', 'prisoner', 'number', 'one', 'fan', '.The', 'audience', 'uneasy', '.if', 'Hitchcock', 'had', 'directed', 'uneasiness', 'would', 'have', 'grown', 'fear', 'lot', 'sooner', 'Reiner', 'good', 'director', 'little', 'genre', 'here', 'invokes', 'realism', 'instead', 'symbolism', 'point', 'signs', 'impending', 'Annie', 'breakdown', 'Even', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'will', 'be', 'hit', 'head', 'clues', 'Annie', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'when', 'new', 'book', 'one', 'element', 'film', 'opinion', 'being', 'truly', 'great', 'background', 'story', 'going', 'sheriff', 'wife', 'Sheldon', 'publicist', 'trying', 'find', 'well', 'kept', 'background', 'necessary', 'inject', 'realism', 'what', 'happening', 'Paul.How', 'Annie', 'Paul', 'revenge', 'other', 'something', 'will', 'recoil', 'watch', 'film.Bates', 'stunning', 'role', 'won', 'award', 'filmmaking', 'gone', 'be', 'most', 'memorable', 'character', 'actress', 'Reiner', 'Caan', 'especially', 'Caan', 'who', 'resuscitated', 'post-Godfather', 'career', 'also', 'contributed', 'heavily', 'very', 'real', 'life', 'tragedy', 'stalking/obsessive', 'phenomena', 'famous', 'people', 'sometimes', 'have', 'live', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'bloopers', 'film', 'most', 'think', 'Reiner', 'left', 'sort', 'signpost', 'see', 'who', 'would', 'pick', 'up', 'favorite', 'Reiner-ism', 'video', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'Reiner', 'film', 'clearly', 'visible', 'one', 'Annie', 'trips', 'local', 'store.And', 'film', 'chock', 'full', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled', 'leave', 'one', 'Bates', 'Annie', 'height', 'madness', 'Oh', 'whole', 'house', 'going', 'be', 'full', 'romance', 'OOOH', 'am', 'going', 'put', 'Liberace', 'records', 'Add', 'collection', 'memorable', 'thriller']",N/A

156492,A3KSPMD210TJPU,0792846338,Matt Tawesson,"[0, 1]","This is one of the greatest movies ever made in the history of American cinema. Misery is about a famous author, Paul Sheldon (played by James Caan), who has just finished writing a book that does not yet have a title (""Untitled"" was the name of it). He goes out leaving the lodge he was staying in and shortly after he leaves, there is a huge snowstorm coming down, so bad to a point that Paul loses control of his car (a '65 Mustang, believe it or not), and crashes down a hill and lies for sometime in the overturned car, mangled and almost dead. Luckily for him, along comes Annie Wilkes (played by Kathy Bates), who saves him and nurses him back to health in the comforts of her own country home. A couple of days later, Paul wakes up and sees himself in Annie's home, and he realizes that she is his ""Number 1 Fan"", and proves it by having all of Paul's published Misery archives of the Misery character. At first, Annie seems like a nice person, but shortly later on, she becomes a total [...] and reveals her true colors when she reads about Misery being killed. She has an extreme fit (probably much worse than a general PMS fit) about Misery's demise and insists that Paul write a new novel to ""bring Misery back"", which she called ""Misery's Return""! (After making him burn his untitled book in a barbecue grill!!) How ridiculous and senseless that seems; it's quite obvious that when a character ends up dead in a story, he or she cannot possibly come back to life. Another incredible and intriguing scene is while Annie is at the store getting new typing paper for Paul because the kind she got was the kind that smudged, he gets out of his room and discovers Annie's scrapbook. This is where he learns of her troubled past by seeing the newspaper articles about these various people who were killed in her care at the hospital where she worked, including numerous infant babies (the scene where he hurries back to his room after hearing Annie's Jeep pull up returning to the house is a nail biter as well; you almost think he won't make it back in time but he does--narrowly). Annie also becomes obsessed with Paul and his writing of the ""new novel"" that not only is she nursing him back to health (in a macabre and slow way), but she is also holding him against his will in her home. In other words, Annie was making it quite difficult and almost impossible for Paul to survive and recover. Some of the people closest to him, his agent (played by screen legend Lauren Bacall), and Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen (the husband-and-wife police team), have almost no hope of ever finding Paul alive. But, towards the end of the movie, the sheriff goes to Annie's house inquiring about Paul, and Annie is giving just idle and small talk about her ""general liking"" for Paul's work. When the sheriff leaves, Paul makes a noise to distract the sheriff, sheriff walks back in, sees Paul downstairs in the cellar and gets shot by Annie's double barrel shotgun! The hobbling scene earlier in the film is scary to watch, and you almost feel the intense pain that Paul feels when Annie uses her strength to smash his ankles on that log; she did that to make sure he stays in his room and continues writing. Before she hobbles his feet, she also took away what I call his ""freedom key"", which was one of her bobby pins from her hair. What a hateful lady Annie is!!! The real showdown comes at the end of the movie when Paul and Annie are fighting. She's eager to find out what happens at the end of the book, but Paul tries to knock her out and the fight is on. The whole fight seems to be over when Paul trips Annie and she lands onto the typewriter (its bell rings when she bangs her head on it; ouch!!). But, a few seconds later, when Paul has crawled out of his room, Annie comes back for more and she is obviously finished off when Paul hits her with what I call an ""iron version of Misery the pig"", and it's over. I am a huge fan of this movie and of Kathy Bates. She is a great and excellent actress and she truly deserved her Oscar for her role as Annie Wilkes. Annie Wilkes is also one of the most scary fictitious characters in the history of American cinema.

Under the assured direction of Rob Reiner, the movie presents a chilling study of an obsessive...and deranged...fan.  Kathy Bates won an Oscar for her impeccable portrayal of Annie Wilkes, author Paul Sheldon's ""number one fan.""  She rescues him after he has an accident in a fierce blizzard and nurses him back to health (she's an ex-nurse).  All goes well until Bates discovers that Sheldon has killed off her favorite character, the titular MISERY, and she goes bonkers and forces him to bring the character back.  While Bates is certainly riveting, James Caan is remarkable as well in his role as the victimized author.  It's a shame Oscar overlooked him for this role, as he is just as good as Ms. Bates, and gives a commanding performance.

156496,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,0792846338,Michael Crane,"[3, 3]","Based on the horrifying novel by Stephen King, &quot;Misery&quot; is a disturbing and frightening thriller that will leave you feeling numb and breathless by the time that the end credits start to roll.  Filmed very similar to Hitchcock films, the movie starts slow and seems innocent, until you start to realize that you're in for a very rough ride.The story is this:  Paul is a very successful writer of the &quot;Misery&quot; novels.  After finishing writing a novel that was solely for himself, he gets caught up in a terrible snowstorm and gets into a serious car accident.  He surely would've died if it had not been for his number one fan, Annie, rescuing him from his car and nursing him back to health while his fractured legs heal.  Just when he thinks he's the luckiest guy in the world, he slowly starts to learn that Annie just might not be that much of a wonderful person, especially when it comes to a point where she's literally holding him hostage in her house in the middle of nowhere.  Paul used to write for a living... now, he must write to save his life!The directing and screenplay of this film was very well done.  I have not read the book, so I can't really comment if the movie stays true to the book.  I also really liked the music in it, which reminded me of &quot;Psycho.&quot;  Kathy Bates is truly remarkable at playing a psychotic fan with nothing to lose.  As you see her more and more in the movie, you feel her slowly slipping into insanity that will scare the hell out of you.  Although this movie is not gratuitously violent, when the violent scenes do happen they are very intense and almost hard to watch, so be warned.  Be prepared to see something very gruesome and painful... I won't give away the part, but chances are you already know what happens from some of the parodies of this movie.All in all, this was a great thriller that kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time.  Since this is sort of a old movie, there are no &quot;eye-popping&quot; or &quot;jaw-dropping&quot; extras on the DVD.  There are some, like the trailer and teaser, but not much else, so keep that in mind.  If you're a Stephen King fan, or you just like a good thriller that never lets go, &quot;Misery&quot; will do just the job for you.",4,One Powerful and Frightening Thriller!

156499,AN8M401S8Y6DA,0792846338,Mike Liddell,"[10, 12]","In my opinion The Shining is the greatest of all Stephen King adaptations and then Misery.  There are actually a lot of similarities between Misery and The Shining.  There both about writers, in secluded locations, who are deserted at some point due to a snow storm.  They both have characters that aren't all there mentally and we are witness to their descent into madness and loss of reality.  Both Bates and Nicholson have a way with tools, whether it be an axe or a sledge hammer, and with these tools they have cut and hobbled their way into our memories and into film history.Kathy Bates is the star of this film and deserves her Oscar win as the at times lovable Annie Wilkes, the obsessed fan of author Paul Sheldon played by James Caan.  Annie goes from saving Paul to keeping him hostage for her own agenda.  The ""shining"" beacon of this film is without a doubt Kathy Bates who for me is one of the most memorable and witty villains of modern horror film up there with Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.  With that said Caan is there like a dance partner for Bates every step of the way, he is like John Stockton to her Karl Malone always ready to assist her in enhancing the dark comedy throughout with his reactions by facial expression or perfect delivery of his lines.  Caan's non verbal reactions to Annie's tirades are priceless and only enhance her dialouge.  Pay attention to Caan's facial expressions during the scene when Annie explains about ""chapter plays"" and don't call them cliffhangers.So getting back to the king and queen of horror, I had an idea, what if Bate's character Annie Wilkes had rescued/kidnapped Jack Nicholson's character Jack Torrance and what would that dialouge be like.  I think it would go something like this:JACK:  ""Annie, let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration. You're distracting me. And it will then take me time to get back to where I was. You understand?""ANNIE:  ""Understand? UNDERSTAND? I will tell you ""what I understand!"" I go out of my way for you! I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you, and what thanks do I get? ""Oh, you bought the wrong paper, Annie, I can't write on this paper, Annie!"" Well, I'll get your stupid paper but you just better start showing me a little appreciation around here, Mr. MAN!""JACK:  ""Now, we're going to make a new rule. When you come in here and you hear me typing[types]or whether you DON'T hear me typing, or whatever the F you hear me doing; when I'm in here, it means that I am working, THAT means don't come in. Now, do you think you can handle that?""ANNIE:  ""I thought you were good Jack... but you're not good. You're just another lying ol' dirty birdy.""Just a thought, forgive me for prattling away and making everything all oogy, here's the dvd features.COLLECTOR'S EDITION DVD FEATURES:(A reviewer listed them above but in case they got lost in the review shuffle here they are again)First if your like me and like a nice pristine transfer and good sound the dvd is a definite and worthwhile upgrade.

The title is kind of ironic because it really is after the main character of paul sheldon's romance novels Misery Chastain, but if you think about it, being where he was, held captive by a psychotic obsessive nurse. Misery is the word, (miserable) Anyway Kathy Bates is brilliant, and my favorite parts are when she goes from nice nurse can i getcha anything to overreacting completely opposite psycho nurse, like a split personality scaring the sh*t out of paul sheldon. And the fact that he had to patronize her to keep her happy, and humor her outbursts was even more intense because you never knew what she would do next. Think of it, a famous writer crashes his car in a snow-storm, and is suddenly rescused by a seemingly nice woman who claims to be his number 1 fan. What a coincidence. At first he doesn't know what is in store for him, and he starts to catch on to her odd temper and bizarre comments about his books. It's a creepy thriller and the fact that the place was in the middle of nowhere, and he cant walk or get to a phone, and she keeps lying to him that the roads arent cleared yet. The story was brilliantly written and it's the kind of scenario that is like a worste nightmare. Rob Reiner directed it perfectly, and an especially nice touch was when annie flipped out over the paper preference and the classical music kept getting faster and faster when she got more and more angry while yelling WHAT'S THE MATTER? I GO OUTTA MY WAY FOR YOU! I DO EVERYTHING TO TRY AND MAKE YOU HAPPY. AND WHAT THANKS DO I GET. YOU BOUGHT THE WRONG PAPER ANNIE, I CANT TYPE ON THIS ANNIE. WELL I'LL GET YOU YOUR STUPID PAPER BUT YOU BETTER SHOW ME A LITTLE MORE APPRECIATION HERE MR MAN!!!!!!! Obviously indicating that she overreacts and is a raving lunatic. And she keeps getting worse and worse, like slamming chairs against the walls, slamming the paper stacks on his legs, bringing out guns, and tying him to the bed, giving him shots, and then breaking his ankles so he couldnt escape.

It is not only increasingly unnerving, but also darkly humorous.  In it we see James Caan as the author on a particularly successful franchise of books about a woman called Misery.  Whilst on his way back to his publisher (Lauren Bacall), he crashes his car and is rescued by Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), his number one fan, who nurses him back to health.  However, when she finds out that her favourite author is putting an end to Misery, she goes over the edge.  The film is actually based on a real-life experience of Stephen King's whereby a man broke into his home, claiming that he had a bomb.  It talks about the way in which fans can all too literally trap their idols under through their heightened expectations.The script is another stroke of genius, with several scenes from the book being wisely deleted.  For instance, a police officer that Annie runs over with a lawnmower (something that actress Kathy Bates thought would be funny) is emitted.  Whilst in the book it's another stage in Annie's mania, on the big screen it would just seem silly.  Secondly, the acting too is superb.  Kathy Bates gives the performance of her career, with James Caan just as good as her frustrated captive.  The tension between the two is wonderfully paced and you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat in many scenes.  What makes Annie such a disturbing villain is that her seemingly ordinary nature, using quaint phrases such as 'dirty birdie' whilst carefully tending to a small farm.There are countless highlights here but the end battle is brilliant.

The acting is sensational, the plot line comes from the greatest Horror writer of all time and works very well, the production is good in general, and the suspense is mind boggling and terrifying.To briefly describe the plot, a famous author named Paul Sheldon (James Caan) gets into a car accident, suffering severe injuries to his legs. He is discovered and saved by a fan of his, named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates). Sheldon is quick to learn that Annie is a huge fan of his work with a book series called Misery. What he doesn't know is that her love for his work goes even beyond extreme obsession, and she holds an unbreakable bond to the lead character in the series, Misery Chastain. This causes a devastating conflict for Sheldon, since he has decided to kill off the Misery Chastain and the series. We first notice her psychoticism at the point where she is urging Paul to burn his latest book, as she was given the rare opportunity to read his latest piece of work which is yet to be published.This film is put together with perfection, incorporating the small, necessary details from the novel into the film, while wisely leaving out the unnecessary ones. Kathy Bates gives a remarkable performance as Annie Wilkes, and was rightfully so honoured winning Best Actress at the Academy Awards in 1990. James Caan also delivers his character role exceptionally well, playing the suttle, shy and quick thinking Paul Sheldon. The minor characters, most notably the Sheriff do a great job adding to the plotline and making the film a thrill to watch.Misery surpasses a number of horror movies in its sensational quality, as it magnificently incorporates the suspense amongst numerous happenings. The story flows along very nicely, and there lies not a dull moment. The climax is truly stunning and captivating and will leave you in complete surprise. Another interesting quality this film offers is to intentionally have the viewer become frustrated with Mr. Sheldon's struggle to overcome his anxiety and pain.I would definitely have to recommend this film to all who love horror films, readers of Stephen King, or anyone who wants to see a true film of suspense and terror. Only the slowest of minds couldn't appreciate this work of genius. I also highly recommend reading the novel, as it does carry some significant differences to the film, and is just as suspenseful and exciting as the film.",5,An Extraordinary Horror Film; Equal To King's Book,1112486400,"04 3, 2005",2005,2497,"['Misery', 'one', 'rare', 'horror', 'films', 'where', 'get', 'component', 'movie', 'perfect', 'acting', 'sensational', 'plot', 'line', 'greatest', 'Horror', 'writer', 'time', 'very', 'well', 'production', 'good', 'general', 'suspense', 'mind', 'boggling', 'terrifying.To', 'briefly', 'describe', 'plot', 'famous', 'author', 'named', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'James', 'Caan', 'car', 'accident', 'suffering', 'severe', 'injuries', 'legs', 'discovered', 'saved', 'fan', 'named', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Sheldon', 'quick', 'learn', 'Annie', 'huge', 'fan', 'work', 'book', 'series', 'called', 'Misery', 'What', ""n't"", 'know', 'love', 'work', 'even', 'extreme', 'obsession', 'unbreakable', 'bond', 'lead', 'character', 'series', 'Misery', 'Chastain', 'devastating', 'conflict', 'Sheldon', 'decided', 'kill', 'off', 'Misery', 'Chastain', 'series', 'first', 'notice', 'psychoticism', 'point', 'where', 'urging', 'Paul', 'burn', 'latest', 'book', 'was', 'given', 'rare', 'opportunity', 'read', 'latest', 'piece', 'work', 'yet', 'be', 'published.This', 'film', 'put', 'together', 'perfection', 'incorporating', 'small', 'necessary', 'details', 'novel', 'film', 'wisely', 'leaving', 'out', 'unnecessary', 'ones', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'was', 'rightfully', 'so', 'honoured', 'winning', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Academy', 'Awards', '1990', 'James', 'Caan', 'also', 'character', 'role', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'playing', 'suttle', 'shy', 'quick', 'thinking', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'minor', 'characters', 'most', 'notably', 'Sheriff', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'adding', 'plotline', 'making', 'film', 'thrill', 'watch.Misery', 'number', 'horror', 'movies', 'sensational', 'quality', 'magnificently', 'suspense', 'amongst', 'numerous', 'happenings', 'story', 'along', 'very', 'nicely', 'there', 'not', 'dull', 'moment', 'climax', 'truly', 'stunning', 'captivating', 'will', 'leave', 'complete', 'surprise', 'interesting', 'quality', 'film', 'intentionally', 'have', 'viewer', 'become', 'frustrated', 'Mr.', 'Sheldon', 'struggle', 'overcome', 'anxiety', 'pain.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'have', 'recommend', 'film', 'who', 'love', 'horror', 'films', 'readers', 'Stephen', 'King', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'true', 'film', 'suspense', 'terror', 'Only', 'slowest', 'minds', 'could', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'work', 'genius', 'also', 'highly', 'recommend', 'reading', 'novel', 'carry', 'significant', 'differences', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'suspenseful', 'exciting', 'film']",N/A

156513,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,0792846338,Paperbackstash,"[1, 1]","Rob Reiner isn't a fan of horror or even supernatural films but felt drawn to the King plot and decided to give it a go. His general avoidance of the genre allowed him to not delve into old and worn cliches and give us something new. We have a purely psychological horror movie with drama undertones and an exceptional cast.What Annie is most obsessed with is Paul's series featuring Misery Chastain. She happens to find his newest manuscript that he had in his car with him. In this version he had killed Misery off and Annie goes berserk! After calming herself a little she then sits and thinks that maybe he just did an evil turn and can now redeem himself. She sets up a writing area for him and forces him to resurrect her beloved character...or suffer the consequences. Definitely not the most ideal climate to work in, Sheldon is confused, afraid, and underneath that is outrage and anger wanting to break free.Annie Wilkes, played by Kathy Bates, won an academy award for best actress. This role really brought her to the attention of the public. Paul Sheldon, played by James Caan, was convincing. These two are the main characters but we also see a sheriff and his wife for some parts. This was done to break up the isolation theme of the movie and add interesting contrast. One thing I feel when watching Sheldon is how helpless he is. Trapped, wounded, isolated, confused and drugged.The scene where Paul goes to ""explore"" while Annie is coming from the store is so wound full of tension I could barely tolerate it. My heart was pumping, my stomach was tight, my nerves were on full alert. I couldn't even sit still.Some of the scenes involving Wilkes and Sheldon are startlingly brutal and stay in your head. The nurse is obviously bananas and you catch glimpses between rage, compassion, loneliness, and a morbid type of love/desire.One thing funny to watch is Annie's dialogue. ""You silly bird"" and other quotes are priceless. She also says ""Oh, pooh,"" and has her own made believe thesaurus replacing common swear words. She has a big pot bellied pet pig (named Misery of course), and we see such a complex person here that we can't help but clap for the scriptwriter.We also get to witness some psychological warfare going on and the battle of an intelligent mind versus a loony one.The climax is a brilliant wrap-up; no cop outs here and it ended exactly the way it should have.I did happen to have read this novel. More violent and gruesome but not too much was altered for the screen so King fans should walk away pleased.Overall a great movie that keeps the heart pumping and the mind working, while holding the gore at bay. Reiner may not be the biggest horror fan -- but he makes it well and even though blockbuster has this in their drama section, this little horror splash is not getting away from us!

156514,A2QDD6OWIAEBED,0792846338,"Paul Aragon ""krakatoa1883""","[2, 4]","Rob Reiner's 1990 adaption of Stephen King's Misery is a film that works for various reasons, a few of which I will touch on here. The most obvious reason is of course the Oscar winning performance of Kathy Bates, as nut job Annie Wilkes. Playing a dangerous psycho as opposed to just another straight person is already the actors equivalent of being a peacock in a room full of pigeons, but it is all the more stricking here because both Kathy Bates and Rob Reiner are entirely on the same page, that is to say, they both seem to understand precisely what makes Annie Wilkes tick, and what makes the movie tick for that matter. You can look at this movie as simply the story of a misfortunate man at the mercy of a monster, who in the end, must truimph over this monster by killing it, or you could see it in a more darkly subversive light.The darker subversive light to this story, is to see it as a tragic love affair. It can be seen as a story in which a delusional person ( Annie Wilkes ) thinks that the object of her desire is something more then an ordinary man, so she built him into a God that should be placed on an alter, high on a pedestal. Just like some kind of childlike innocent, her admiration of him is of the most idealistic variety, and seems to be platonic and almsot spiritually based. She spends most of the film wallowing in a sort of self made torment of keeping her love object at arms lenth, where instead of culminating her true bodily cravings, she instead idolizes and worships her object while living forever in her own little fantasy dream world that has no place for such lewd lascivious base hungers. The problem here is that these types of feelings are what normally hits a young shy teen boy durring his first ever crush, not a grown woman facing middle age. Every action Annie Wilkes takes is to abstain from the unavoidable culmination of their eventual coitus, thus when the act of sex finally happens, it is explosive, volatile, and violent, it shatters her delusional bubble. The subversive sex act itself involves blood, fire, biting, beating, the climactic firing of her viral maleness, and some extremely raunchy sex talk, in fact, it is the first time Annie Wilkes uses real adult language rather then her amusing ""Cock-a-doo-dee"" speak. Not to be outdone by Annie Wilkes sudden sexually charged emergence, Paul Sheldon ( James Caan ), her love object shoves burning paper into her mouth and yells the movies most memorable line "" HERE YOU WANT IT?! EAT IT!! EAT IT TILL YOU CHOKE YOU SICK TWISTED.....!"" Yes, the sex talk gets down right dirty and full of imaginative urgent energy. The action finally ends with the two of them lying side by side on the hard wood floor, a hitherto never before seen look of fullfillment etched on her burnt and bloody face, while her love object pants from all the exertion spent to quell this passionate violent act, it would seem that the only thing missing is that they are not smoking cigarettes.Since sex is arguably the main reason we are alive, and is possibly what holds the candle to our very creative energy, it is hard not to see this film play out in this more subversive way. I feel that both Kathy Bates and Rob Reiner captured this aspect of both Annie Wilkes and the film perfectly and deliberately. On a sidenote, I think Annie Wilkes is the male in this twisted realationship, capable of giving her object a nice firemans carry with sturdy vigor.The others aspect of this film to point out is the concise stream-lined direction by Rob Reiner which makes viewing this film such a pleasure. Each scene is just the right size and has just the right amount of spice to keep things moving, seemingly without effort. Maybe I am becoming old and refined in my ways, but I can't stress enough the importance of not overdoing something, and keeping things singular and simplistic in nature. The bad aspect is that once again writer Stephen King has taken an existing movie, in this case its ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane"" 1962, and passed it off as his own inspired ideas. His plagiarizing continued with other such works as TommyKnockers, ( Five Million Years to Earth 1968 ) and Christine, ( The Car 1977 ) , but its hardly a knock on Misery, which holds its own very nicely thanks to aspects that were picked out in the acting and directing.Misery is a good bit of entertainment to keep in your collection, and a very affordable and abundant movie to find, at least untill they release a 20th anniversary addition or something, full of extras the current release does not have.",4,"""Give me.... your dirty love!""",1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,4573,"['Rob',

156524,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,0792846338,Robert J. Schneider,"[3, 3]","When he manned the filmed adaptation of Stephen King's great 1987 best-seller MISERY in 1990, Rob Reiner, known at that time mainly for hilarious comedies like THIS IS SPINAL TAP (1983), THE PRINCESS BRIDE (1987) and WHEN HARRY MET SALLY...(1989), showed that he could also direct a suspenseful thriller. He did a terrific job. Starring James Caan as injured, cynical romance novelist Paul Sheldon, and Kathy Bates as obsessed nurse and &quot;Number-One Fan&quot; Annie Wilkes, MISERY is perfectly cast and is one of the few truly successful Stephen King film adapatations. Indeed, in some ways it is even better than the book! It keeps the dark, cynical humor and concentrates more on the psychological cat-and-mouse game between Sheldon and Wilkes than on visual shocks. It definitely tones down the level of graphic violence from the novel; for example, Annie carries a sledgehammer instead of an axe. Also, she has no electric knife in the movie. Although the book's gore was effectively disturbing in written form, it would have been unnecessary and distracting in the film version.Better yet, Reiner focuses on the character-driven psychological horror and suspense, which draws you in right from the beginning and never lets up. James Caan strikes the right note for his portrayal of the bedridden Paul Sheldon. With his subtle, cynical, sarcastic, detached tone, Caan conveys a talented author whose whole world turned upside down, along with his car, on an icy road in the middle of nowhere. Being cared for/imprisoned by crazy, obsessed nurse Annie Wilkes, Caan creates a sympathetic character who refuses to accept himself as a helpless victim. Kathy Bates, in her first-ever filmic starring role, became the perfect embodiment of the Annie Wilkes that Stephen King had created in his novel, and as a result, deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress in 1990 (unusual for a Horror/Suspense film). Up to that point, Kathy Bates had been mainly a stage actress and was very well known in those circles, but she was virtually unknown to Hollywood despite having appeared in over 15 movies. MISERY quickly put her on the map, and she subsequently starred in excellent and diverse films such as FRIED GREEN TOMATOES (1991), DOLORES CLAIBORNE (another Stephen King adaptation, it was released in 1995 and should have earned her another Oscar nomination, at the very least), TITANIC (1997) and PRIMARY COLORS (1998).Also notable in MISERY are the supporting actors: Richard Farnsworth as the town sheriff who gets involved in the search for the missing author, Frances Sternhagen as his cranky wife and assistant, and Lauren Bacall, in a welcome return to the screen as Paul Sheldon's agent, who initiates the search process. The story is well-paced, the dialogue priceless, the claustrophobic cinematography excellent.

Penola,"[6, 8]","While the book by Stephen King paints the portrait of psychotic-obsessed fan with glee, Kathy Bates, in this film version of MISERY, brings a pathos and dimension to the character of Annie that drastically improves the  story. Her performance, which is anything but predictable or one-note, as  it is in the book, transforms a simple but compelling tale of obsession  into a dynamic exploration into madness, much like PSYCHO.  I loved the  relative simplicity of this movie, which, by virtue of its claustrophic  plot, rarely leaves Annie's house, and there are moments that actually had  me writhing in my seat.  Rob Reiner wisely leaves the movie mostly in the  hands of his two big pros, and they are up to the challenge.  James Caan is  a perfect foil for Annie's affections/brutality - his age and flashing wit  work well in the role of Paul Sheldon, an author with his own artistic  baggage, but it is Bates who commands the movie from beginning to end.  Her  short monologue in the rain, a gun in her pocket, is so tragically sad that  your fear of her actually melts.

Her slow revelation of insanity to her captive favorite author is so captivating and so disturbing that you'll be thinking of her everytime you require medical attention.  James Caan plays Paul Sheldon very well and the small supporting cast (especially the recently deceased Richard Farnsworth as the sheriff) make this an enjoyable adaptation of the brilliant novel.  Although some of the more graphic elements of the novel were slightly altered (the hobbling scene for instance) for either rating or budget constraints.The exploration of human psychosis is the key element here, and no one since Anthony Perkins in Psycho has brought a more convincing and somewhat sympathetic mad character to life.

This is a tense, thrilling, and finely crafted film that even has hints of dark comedy thrown in from time to time, mostly revolving around the sometimes awkward and sometimes disturbing conversations between Paul Sheldon (James Caan), and Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates). Seeing Bates playing a complete psycho was certainly interesting and a bit fun, if I may be so bold. While at times her odd speech and behavior had me laughing, even in some of the so-called dramatic moments, at other times they had me filled with terror and unease as I realized along with Paul just what sort of grave situation he had found himself in. He's crippled from an accident in the house of his self proclaimed ""number one fan"", who's one of those obsessed stalker types that tend to pop up from time to time in our celebrity obsessed society. In fact, she reminded me a bit of Sandra Bernhard's character Masha from the disturbingly hilarious black comedy The King of Comedy. She has a definite air of unpredictability about her, and you never know how she'll respond to a certain situation, making her perhaps one of the most frightening villains in cinematic history, right up there with Hannibal Lecter, Patrick Bateman, and Johan Liebert from the manga/anime series Monster. Kathy Bates put on a real good performance here, I will say that, perhaps one of the best of her career, and certainly superior to her role as Dolores Claiborne in the other Stephen King adaptation she starred in. James Caan also did great in his role as Paul Sheldon, a hapless writer trapped in a nightmarish situation that is all too real for many famous people, who often fear meeting obsessive fans like Annie. Of course Annie isn't all bad, there are moments of true kindness and sweetness that when looked back upon during some of her more psycho moments, seem almost unreal. It certainly doesn't seem unrealistic though, as many psychopaths and serial killers appear kind and friendly, even charming, to most people, but have a hidden dark side that most people would never suspect. Just look at murderers like Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy. Great Film but no masterpiece due to the fact that there was a bit too much unintentional humor in some scenes.

156539,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,0792846338,S. Rhodes,"[2, 3]","There have been some VERY good King adaptations (ie: ""The Green Mile,"" ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Delores Claiborne""), some that are good but aren't the book (Kubrick's ""The Shining"", ""Christine"") and some that are godawful (""Pet Sematary"", ""Dreamcatcher"").  ""Misery"" falls into the first category of being very good.  And it's a good thing too, because that was one of the best King novels.Misery centers on a famous novelist named Paul Sheldon (played by James Caan).  He's just finished his new book, and while there's a storm coming in, he feels he can still take his finished manuscript to his literary agent.  On the way, the snow storm gets the better of him and he skids off the road.All seems lost for Paul, until he's found and pryed from the car.  When he awakens he's in the midst of Annie Wilkes (played by Oscar winner Kathy Bates), who claims to be his number one fan.While nursing Paul back to health, she picks up the latest book in Paul Sheldon's ""Misery"" series, and is rather disappointed by Paul killing off his main character Misery Chastain.  Now Annie is mad, and wants Paul to write a book just for her.*From the book*""She has a lot of ways to spur him on.  One is a needle.  Another is an ax.  And if they don't work, she can get real nasty.""Unfortunately, like most book adaptations, some things have to be changed and others have to be cut.  Annie doesn't spur Paul on with an ax, she does it with a sledge hammer.  And while Kathy Bates plays an excellent Annie Wilkes (she won an oscar for it), she wasn't nearly as incredible as she was in the book.The book was also frightening.  This movie is not.  I agree, it isn't right to expect the book, but I did expect certain things.  It follows the book closely... but this is a horror movie for cryin' out loud!  It NEEDS to be scary.  It's suspenseful, yes, but it isn't scary.Misery is an incredible film.  One of the best situational movies ever made, and one of the best King adaptations (unfortunately good movies made from Stephen King's books are too few and far between).  Watch it.  Don't expect something to scare the pants off you, and don't expect Annie to be as psychotic as she was in the book (for those who read it).

156540,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,0792846338,S. Schell,"[0, 1]","Paul Sheldon, renowned novelist of the Misery Chastaine series, has just finished a new composition and is on his way to the airport to fy to New York and confer with his editor. A snowstorm develops in the surrounding area, the road becoming increasingly difficult to see. He squints past the dash through the roaring blizzard, swerving uncontrollably across the icy tracks. His car suddenly careens off the road, tumbling down an embankment and becoming burrowed in the mounting height of snowfall. The crash knocks him unconscious and renders him helpless for he has sustained multiple fractures in both legs and various other injuries. In the middle of the chaos, a mysterious figure spots the buried automobile and drags Paul from the carnage, throwing him over their shoulder and carrying him to safety. When he awakes, the face of a young nurse hangs over him declaring proudly that she is his number one fan. Little does he know, this is a fact she will prove time and again during his tenure at the Wilkes farm.Paul (James Caan) begins contemplating his escape the minute Wilkes' true nature is revealed to him in a fit of rage over his new manuscript. She frightens him into reducing his only copy to charred morsels and he is then coerced into penning his ninth installment of the Misery Chastain saga, unwillingly resurrecting his deceased heroine. As time goes on and Paul's wounds heal, he begins to see Annie's obsession with Misery's fictitious world burgeon to pure lunacy. He eventually comes to the doomed conclusion that his only way out will be his life or hers...&quot;Misery&quot; couldn't have been a more appropriate appellation for what Paul endures throughout this entire film under the domineering and neurotic guardianship of Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates). Bates is spine-chilling as the reclusive and irrational medic who keeps Paul captive in her foreboding lodge, dulling his senses with powerful painkillers and preventing his escape by any means. She is a dangerously intelligent fraud, perfectly unsuspecting in her demure manner and lighthearted disposition. This is a device that flawlessly conceals the fiery malice lurking beneath her charismatic shell. Bates won an Oscar for Best Actress for her disquieting and methodical portrayal and, along with her recognition from the Academy, unknowingly attained a special place in Stephen King's heart paired with another starring role in his next adaptation titled &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; (see my review on that).Caan is an interesting choice for the abducted author, his fear and rage believable, although this wasn't difficult to portray with somebody as brilliantly convincing as Bates on the job. He is the unlikely candidate for a role such as this after the portrayal of hot-headed Italian sibling Sonny Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's masterful trilogy of Godfather movies. He makes us cringe with his agonizing screams, falling out of his bed and banging his splinted legs on the hardwood floor. His determination and hopelessness are evident in his mobile face, and he makes for a great protagonist in this eerie tale.Co-starring to the thrill of Bates is the late Richard Farnsworth (The Straight Story) as Buster, the county sheriff investigating Paul Sheldon's disappearance. Lauren Bacall makes a relaxed cameo as Sheldon's editor who prods him about abruptly ending his enduring literary series.Most surprising was the direction by Rob Reiner, the architect of such zany comedies &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot;, &quot;Throw Momma From The Train&quot; and &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;. This is not his usual schtick and it's nice to see him venturing forth into unexplored territory. Compare some of the camerawork from &quot;Misery&quot; to one of the above mentioned (Throw Momma...) and you will see the remarkable similarities.I prefer reading most of King's tale instead of watching them because often movies cheapen the psychoanalysis that books offer for their characters and the possibility of bad casting can put some of your favorite stories to shame.

Keep in mind that the quality of what you see and hear also depends upon the quality of TV monitor you are using and its accompanying home theater processor and speakers. I have a pretty high end, esoteric system and am judging the Blu Ray off of that.My single disc Blu Ray shares the same cover as the two disc repackage.VIDEO QUALITY....While I do have the Standard Def DVD, this is not a comparison between the two formats.  I was surprised that the video quality was as good as it was.  The slightly saturated warm tones are natural in every way.  There were no artifacts in any part of the disc nor was there any aliasing seen, even on Kathy Bates knitted sweater where stair stepping would have likely to be seen. Contrast and details were very strong through out.  Snow tones were exceedingly real in color and detail as well.  While the menu was a static shot with only Play, Scenes and Audio setup, the video quality, with an average Mbps rate in the mid thirties, deserves 5 stars.AUDIO QUALITY...The lossless DTS HD 5.1 audio for this very dialogue driven film is really quite transparent in tone and detail.  Surrounds are used only across the front stage for  the music in the beginning of the film and all surrounds are used nicely during the brief period of snowstorm, also in  the beginning of the film.  There is no discreet use of any of the front or rear speakers for foley fx and not much for the LFE channel to do either.  I heard no problems with the audio at all but would have expected for at least a bit more directionality to come to the side channels.EXTRAS....There were none. No trailers, no commentary, nada, zilch, zip.I do hope that this review, which focused solely upon the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.

Everything from the acting, writing, and the directing is superb. ""Misery"" is a perfect movie.Based on Stephen King's novel of the same name, ""Misery"" is about a deranged woman keeping a man locked in her house against his will. Kathy Bates, who won the 1990 Oscar for Best Actress, came out of no where and made this film her own. A Broadway star with no film credits under her belt, Bates portrays one of the most disturbing and unbalanced women in the history of the cinema. Just when you think she is pleasant and kind she flips out, screaming and yelling obsenities. She plays more than just a bitch in this role; after watching her performance one observes how a person can snap and the problems of borderline personality disorder. James Caan is great as the helpless author Bates holds captive. The movie is interesting and exciting at the same time, and just when you think it can't get any better then Wham!, you are jolted out of your chair. This new DVD also comes with a wonderful documentary where Kathy Bates is interviewed and this is one of the reasons to own this Collector's Item. Rob Reiner did a fantastic job directing this thriller. Sit back and enjoy one of my top 10 favorite films of all-time. I have watched this film over and over and I never tire of it.

Paul Sheldon IS Stephen King here.  Especially being an aspiring writer myself, this is every writer's biggest nightmare.I'm not Stephen King's biggest fan, but I must give credit where credit is due.  I don't even know if he himself realized what he tapped into with this story--given his other works, I fear perhaps not--but even if not, that doesn't change the fact of what he tapped into here.  I'll explain: the primary reason I docked off one star is because Annie Wilkes, like WAY too many psychotic and irredeemably evil Stephen King characters, professes Christianity, apparently knowing nothing more about the faith than what those who hate it the most say about it, while morally evaluating this the opposite way.But in this case I'm not even sure that was worth docking off anything--here that actually seems to be relevant.  Perhaps Mr. King didn't intend it so, but as a Christian myself, I found it to be so.  What I get from the story is this: Annie Wilkes is herself a victim of a society that has rejected God, and this is why she so latches herself onto a series of fictional novels as to make them her &#34;religion&#34;, to the point to where she cannot accept it when even their own author does things with it that she doesn't like.  How else do you explain a science fiction author being the founder of a major religion of our time, if not for a phenomenon like this?  Deny food to the soul, and it will eat anything, no matter how junky it is.I think it's premature for me to dub this Stephen King's best work, especially as I have never read the book, but man oh man....Watch this film (or read the book) at your own risk, especially if you are yourself a writer or aspire to be one.God bless.",4,MAN!!!,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,2047,"['have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'seeing', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'want', 'mean', 'compliment.Not', 'only', 'was', 'genuinely', 'frightened', 'movie', 'heart', 'continued', 'pound', 'long', 'was', 'had', 'gotten', 'online', 'distract', 'what', 'more', 'frightening', 'relevant', 'Paul', 'Sheldon', 'IS', 'Stephen', 'King', 'here', 'Especially', 'being', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'writer', 'biggest', 'nightmare.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'Stephen', 'King', 'biggest', 'fan', 'must', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'realized', 'what', 'tapped', 'story', 'given', 'other', 'works', 'fear', 'perhaps', 'not', 'even', 'not', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'what', 'tapped', 'here', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'primary', 'reason', 'docked', 'off', 'one', 'star', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'WAY', 'too', 'many', 'psychotic', 'irredeemably', 'evil', 'Stephen', 'King', 'characters', 'Christianity', 'apparently', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'more', 'faith', 'what', 'who', 'hate', 'most', 'say', 'morally', 'evaluating', 'opposite', 'way.But', 'case', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'was', 'worth', 'docking', 'off', 'anything', 'here', 'actually', 'be', 'relevant', 'Perhaps', 'Mr.', 'King', 'did', ""n't"", 'intend', 'so', 'Christian', 'myself', 'found', 'be', 'so', 'What', 'get', 'story', 'Annie', 'Wilkes', 'victim', 'society', 'rejected', 'God', 'why', 'so', 'series', 'fictional', 'novels', 'make', '34', 'religion', '34', 'point', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'when', 'even', 'own', 'author', 'things', ""n't"", 'like', 'How', 'else', 'do', 'explain', 'science', 'fiction', 'author', 'being', 'founder', 'major', 'religion', 'time', 'not', 'phenomenon', 'Deny', 'food', 'soul', 'will', 'eat', 'anything', 'matter', 'how', 'junky', 'think', 'premature', 'dub', 'Stephen', 'King', 'best', 'work', 'especially', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'man', 'oh', 'man', '.Watch', 'film', 'read', 'book', 'own', 'risk', 'especially', 'are', 'writer', 'aspire', 'be', 'one.God', 'bless']",N/A

Kathy Bates is very convincing as the psychotic nurse who's loneliness and isolation and 'misery' draws her into a deep obsession with a fictional character penned by a discontented pulp fiction writer.James Caan excels in the role of Paul Sheldon, an author who is sick and tired of writing shallow romantic novels based on shallow characters and wants to do something meaningful for once. When his car is involved in a winter crash he is rescued by Annie Wilkes, a lonely ex--nurse who brings him to her home. Annie wilkes is played superbly by Kathy Bates, you could really believe Bates is psychotic in real life after viewing this movie.  Soon Sheldon realises the terrifying truth, Bates is psychotic and obsessed with the old pulp fiction novels he has just given up (he thought) forever.When she discovers how he has killed off her favourite character she flies into a rage and Sheldon quickly learns the scary truth, she has no plans of alerting the authorities as to his whereabouts. He must now play a dangerous game, he must balance finding a way of escape with avoiding her psychotic rage.This is a very worthy film version of what was an excellent novel (perhaps King's best), because most of the film is restricted to a single location and uses a tiny number of characters, very strong acting performances were essential in order for it to work. These were indeed supplied (Bates in particular over-achieves in her role here) in the film.

Rob Reiner is the director, and adapts the Stephen King novel to the screen. Considering most of the film takes place in a bedroom, you're going to need a pretty good script to keep such a concept alive and interesting. Fortunately, ""Misery"" is full of interesting plot developments, and as the story moves along, nothing feels boring or tedious. In fact, two of the times I saw this movie were back-to-back on TV (thanks for that, AMC!), and I can honestly say I watched it both times, in a row, without ever getting bored.In addition to Rob Reiner's great directing, we have the talented acting of James Kahn and Kathy Bates, both of whom portray their characters quite realistically and believably. The realism of their acting is partially what makes this movie so frightening, because James Kahn and Kathy Bates make it seem like this sort of things could actually happen, which is a powerful tool in horror movies. In addition, there's no way you can give this movie less than 5 stars after seeing the heart-pounding, realistic terror in the climax!Well, my time here is done. In closing, this is a highly-recommended horror movie for those that want to see an excellent, entertaining and nerve-wracking work of horror genius, especially if you're interested in seeing the realistic side of horror movies.

A very sharp picture transfer on this edition, and some great features including interviews with stars and production crew, as well as audio commentaries (if you go for that).Misery is a fine film with the right ingredients to make it a true suspense thriller.  Kathy Bates shines as the looney devoted fan of author Paul Sheldon (played superbly by James Caan) who happens to rescue him from a car crash and keeps him prisoner.  Nail biting stuff especially when it looks like he'll never escape her clutches.Great to finally see this film getting the DVD transfer it deserves ie. special edition!

156561,A3S98L5B1SR9P1,0792846338,Zack H.,"[1, 1]",It's about a writer who gets in a car accident during a snow storm and his so-called '#1 fan' rescues him and demands him to write a book for her. The writer puts together all of the clues he finds along the way and figures out what she's really trying to do. It's a great movie to grab a bowl of popcorn and watch from beginning to end without any breaks.,5,"Stephen King's ""Misery""",1120867200,"07 9, 2005",2005,356,"['writer', 'who', 'car', 'accident', 'snow', 'storm', 'so-called', '1', 'fan', 'rescues', 'write', 'book', 'writer', 'together', 'clues', 'way', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'trying', 'do', 'great', 'movie', 'grab', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'watch', 'beginning', 'end', 'breaks']",N/A
