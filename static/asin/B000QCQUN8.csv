There is minimal dialogue; which is probably a good thing because the actors didn't do too well with the simple lines that they had.  The costumes might have been good, but the lighting was so terrible that you couldn't see what was going on most of the time.  The lack of a plot was the film's biggest problem.  It's just clowns killing people.Unfortunately, there isn't even a cheese factor to give this movie some redeeming quality.  I was hoping for something overly done like Killer Klowns from Outer Space.  But there is nothing in this movie.  This will never be a cult classic, or even a cheap thrill.

If the people involved with this major catastrophe can get money, we ALL need to go the route of the movie industry.I will say one thing:  the majority of ""indy"" horror productions sell their movie with packaging.  I picked this up and thought, ""hey; interesting cover.  I'll give it a try.""  STUPID, STUPID, STUPID.  This movie is the WORST movie I've ever seen--and I've seen plenty of stinkers in my 54 years.Supposedly set in Port Emmett, Florida, ""Dead Clowns"" is about (I should have read the back of the disc) a terrible tragedy involving of all things a clown car being dumped into the bay--never to be recovered.  It's said, mind you, that on certain nights you can hear the sound of a calliope wafting over the waters...Obviously shot on a shoe-string budget (not to mention a wing and a prayer), there is actually no story at all.  There's some boring footage of a hurricane, the same old shot of wind blown palm trees, traffic lights, and stop signs.  Yep; that about sums up the movie.  Oh...I forgot.  Seems that--for whatever reason--the clowns are now zombies and they have picked this particular night (keep in mind they've been buried for over 50 years) to show up and eat people.  The effects are at an all time low:  think Herschel Gordon Lewis--but WAY worse.  The extras in this movie (and I absolutely refuse to refer to any of them as actors) have as much stage presence as a dead ferret.  The editing, pacing, and directing are all horrible.  The majority of the cast members do not even speak--probably for good reason.This complete waste of time lasts 95 minutes and was distributed by Lionsgate.  People, keep this up and you'll be as defunct as Orion Pictures.  It was directed and written by Steve Sessions and probably shot on his one night off from Jack-In-The-Box.  This movie should be pulled from the shelves and sent back to its distributor.  It is not worth one star.  Possibly the only movie I would give a negative rating.STAY AWAY!!!

Heck, you wouldn't want to be anywhere near the place when a hurricane hits. A travelling circus found that out the hard way fifty years ago when, while on board a train crossing a bridge over the bay (um, wouldn't they have cancelled that predetermined train schedule knowing full well a Category 3 storm was coming?), a tugboat slams into one of the bridge's beams and causes the locomotive to crash into the water below. The clown car (train car, not those tiny ones during the show) is never recovered, which makes for bad news when the current hurricane stirs the now zombie clowns back to the surface for a little revenge (setting up some good gore scenes later on, as apparently, revenge includes flesh eating). Got to hand it to Director/Writer Steve Sessions for some decent editing, bouncing around a few different locations during the storm to help prevent monotony, a good ending with a downbeat twist and managing to scrape together enough cash to get a day's work out of former scream queen Brinke Stevens. Paradoxically, the audio often makes it hard to hear dialogue, the acting is usually stale and unrealistic at best, and the overall pace of the film gets way too slow. Lumbering zombie clowns may not have been the best choice, after all. One thing's for sure: clown costumes must be made out of some really durable material.

1074877,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000QCQUN8,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 3]","An abnormal or exaggerated fear of clowns is known as coulrophobia.  It is not an uncommon fear among children (e.g., Chuckie Finster on ""Rugrats,"" Chris Griffin on ""Family Guy"") and sometimes manifests itself in teenagers (e.g., Xander Harris on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" Haley James on ""One Tree Hill"") and adults ((e.g., Cosmo Kraemer on ""Seinfeld,"" Alan Shore on ""Boston Legal,"" and Adrian Monk on ""Monk"").  So the idea of zombie clowns could be pretty scary, but that is not really the case with ""Dead Clowns,"" yet another DVD from the folks at Lions Gate to prove that the films they select for Horrorfest are no where near the bottom of their barrel of horror films.You know this film is in trouble as soon as you hear the back story: Once upon a time a circus was coming to town, but as the train was crossing the bridge over the bay a big storm wiped out the bridge, the train, and all the clowns (what happened to the rest of the circus is not clear, thereby setting up a whole series of sequels like Dead Elephants, Dead Bare Back Riders, so on and so forth).  Local legend has it that when its raining you can hear circus music and now another big storm is brewing.  In other words, the new storm is going to bring all these dead clowns up from the sandy bottom of the ocean and they are going to start killing people for apparently no logical reason whatsoever.  We never really learn enough about these victims to rejoice in their demises, but then most of them do not have names and appear in the credits as Weather Reporter, Tormented Woman, or Girl with Shotgun.""Dead Clowns"" is written and directed by Steve Sessions (""CREMAINS,"" ""Malefic""), who also did the music for this 2003 horror film, so pretty much everything was under his control.  More than anything else this film reminds be of the Blind Dead films of Amando de Ossorio (the first of which is ""La Noche del terro ciego).""  The films have many things in common: a minimum of dialogue and slow moving murderous zombies that make you want to yell out to the victims ""Walk away!  Walk away!""  Basically ""Dead Clowns"" is about clowns killing and eating people, so anything that gets in the way of that like character development apparently would just get in the way.The gore factor is fairly high in the last part of the film, but without anybody really saying anything or without the usually musical cues we end up being oddly detached from it all.  On the one hand Sessions gets credit for trying to do things a bit differently, but on the other hand this different approach does not really work.  I also have to say that the clown outfits have held up way better than they should have for all those years at the bottom of the bay, although the same cannot be said for the clowns themselves.  Given the art on the cover of the DVD, I was expecting the outfits to be a lot grungier, especially when all you get to see are those oversized clown shoes.  So if you want to check out a scary killer clown movie you would be better off with the 1992 mini-series ""To Catch a Killer"" where Brian Dennehy portrays John Wayne Gacy, or, of course, Tim Curry as Pennywise in ""Stephen King's It.""",2,"Not only those suffering from coulrophobia should avoid ""Dead Clowns""",1186963200,"08 13, 2007",2007,3162,"['abnormal', 'exaggerated', 'fear', 'clowns', 'known', 'coulrophobia', 'not', 'uncommon', 'fear', 'children', 'e.g.', 'Chuckie', 'Finster', 'Rugrats', 'Chris', 'Griffin', 'Family', 'Guy', 'sometimes', 'manifests', 'teenagers', 'e.g.', 'Xander', 'Harris', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'Haley', 'James', 'One', 'Tree', 'Hill', 'adults', 'e.g.', 'Cosmo', 'Kraemer', 'Seinfeld', 'Alan', 'Shore', 'Boston', 'Legal', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'Monk', 'idea', 'zombie', 'clowns', 'could', 'be', 'pretty', 'scary', 'not', 'really', 'case', 'Dead', 'Clowns', 'yet', 'DVD', 'folks', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'prove', 'films', 'select', 'Horrorfest', 'are', 'where', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'horror', 'films.You', 'know', 'film', 'trouble', 'as', 'soon', 'hear', 'back', 'story', 'Once', 'time', 'circus', 'was', 'coming', 'town', 'train', 'was', 'crossing', 'bridge', 'bay', 'big', 'storm', 'wiped', 'out', 'bridge', 'train', 'clowns', 'what', 'happened', 'rest', 'circus', 'not', 'clear', 'thereby', 'setting', 'up', 'whole', 'series', 'sequels', 'Dead', 'Elephants', 'Dead', 'Bare', 'Back', 'Riders', 'so', 'so', 'forth', 'Local', 'legend', 'when', 'raining', 'can', 'hear', 'circus', 'music', 'now', 'big', 'storm', 'brewing', 'other', 'words', 'new', 'storm', 'going', 'bring', 'dead', 'clowns', 'up', 'sandy', 'bottom', 'ocean', 'are', 'going', 'start', 'killing', 'people', 'apparently', 'logical', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'never', 'really', 'learn', 'enough', 'victims', 'rejoice', 'demises', 'then', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'names', 'appear', 'credits', 'Weather', 'Reporter', 'Tormented', 'Woman', 'Girl', 'Shotgun', 'Dead', 'Clowns', 'written', 'directed', 'Steve', 'Sessions', 'CREMAINS', 'Malefic', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'music', '2003', 'horror', 'film', 'so', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'was', 'control', 'More', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'be', 'Blind', 'Dead', 'films', 'Amando', 'de', 'Ossorio', 'first', 'La', 'Noche', 'del', 'terro', 'ciego', 'films', 'have', 'many', 'things', 'common', 'minimum', 'dialogue', 'slow', 'moving', 'murderous', 'zombies', 'make', 'want', 'yell', 'out', 'victims', 'Walk', 'away', 'Walk', 'away', 'Basically', 'Dead', 'Clowns', 'clowns', 'killing', 'eating', 'people', 'anything', 'way', 'like', 'character', 'development', 'apparently', 'would', 'just', 'get', 'way.The', 'gore', 'factor', 'fairly', 'high', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'anybody', 'really', 'saying', 'anything', 'usually', 'musical', 'cues', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'oddly', 'detached', 'one', 'hand', 'Sessions', 'credit', 'trying', 'do', 'things', 'bit', 'differently', 'other', 'hand', 'different', 'approach', 'not', 'really', 'work', 'also', 'have', 'say', 'clown', 'outfits', 'have', 'held', 'up', 'way', 'better', 'should', 'have', 'years', 'bottom', 'bay', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'clowns', 'Given', 'art', 'cover', 'DVD', 'was', 'expecting', 'outfits', 'be', 'lot', 'grungier', 'especially', 'when', 'get', 'see', 'are', 'oversized', 'clown', 'shoes', 'So', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'scary', 'killer', 'clown', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', '1992', 'mini-series', 'Catch', 'Killer', 'where', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Gacy', 'course', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'Pennywise', 'Stephen', 'King']",Dead Clowns

The story is that all these clowns on a train fell into the bay during a hurricane, and the town just didn't care to spend the money to look for them or remember them so now another hurricane rolls around and the clowns are back after 50 years or so to seek revenge.Only they're not very funny. Really, what's the point of putting clowns in your movie if it's going to be a COMPLETELY humorless film. I don't pick up a clown film because I think it will have a good story, I don't pick them up for the great character development, I pick them up to see clowns killing people in clown-like ways. And zombie clowns? Well, thats brillaint. Except they screwed it up by letting them just be zombies dressed as clowns. I was expecting imagination, I got nothing.The characters are boring, cliche and annoying and the dialogue is dull and drawn out to death. The pacing is all wrong. The only relief comes in waiting for the occassional stock hurricane footage because at least that was filmed well. Only it's the same shots over and over so that gets pretty awful too.But yeah all of that I could've ignored for the most part if these clowns had actually been clowns and killed with imagination. That would have left the problem of the film being unbearably slow, poorly and weirdly lit with bad sound, and generally headache-inducing, but at least I would've thrown down two stars for the interesting deaths.As is, there's no reason to watch this, let alone buy it.",1,headache,1193616000,"10 29, 2007",2007,1511,"['DEAD', 'CLOWNS', 'just', 'headache', 'waiting', 'happen', 'story', 'clowns', 'train', 'fell', 'bay', 'hurricane', 'town', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'spend', 'money', 'look', 'remember', 'so', 'now', 'hurricane', 'around', 'clowns', 'are', 'back', '50', 'years', 'so', 'seek', 'revenge.Only', ""'re"", 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'Really', 'what', 'point', 'putting', 'clowns', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'COMPLETELY', 'humorless', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'clown', 'film', 'think', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'great', 'character', 'development', 'pick', 'up', 'see', 'clowns', 'killing', 'people', 'clown-like', 'ways', 'zombie', 'clowns', 'Well', 'brillaint', 'screwed', 'up', 'letting', 'just', 'be', 'zombies', 'dressed', 'clowns', 'was', 'expecting', 'imagination', 'got', 'nothing.The', 'characters', 'are', 'boring', 'cliche', 'annoying', 'dialogue', 'dull', 'drawn', 'out', 'death', 'pacing', 'wrong', 'only', 'relief', 'waiting', 'occassional', 'stock', 'hurricane', 'footage', 'least', 'was', 'filmed', 'well', 'Only', 'same', 'shots', 'so', 'pretty', 'awful', 'too.But', 'yeah', 'could', ""'ve"", 'ignored', 'most', 'part', 'clowns', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'clowns', 'killed', 'imagination', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'problem', 'film', 'being', 'unbearably', 'slow', 'poorly', 'weirdly', 'lit', 'bad', 'sound', 'generally', 'headache-inducing', 'least', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thrown', 'down', 'two', 'stars', 'interesting', 'deaths.As', 'reason', 'watch', 'let', 'alone', 'buy']",Dead Clowns

Now let us explain that never have we been the type to jump on the bandwagon when it comes to liking or disliking a film. We couldn't care less about what someones opinion is, but just about everyone was spot on here. This one's easily on par with world's top horrific films likeRise Of The ScarecrowsandHalloween Night. No matter how b or how low the budget is Sid can find the enjoyment in almost anything, except a piece of trash like this. In all the disasters we've watched this one sits in the top 5 and will make an appearance on the ""He's Gone the Evil's Gone from Here"" list.Dead Clowns (aka Man that looks like a dead bear) takes place on a home video camera somewhere in Florida. A hurricane is coming into the area and dominates the first half hour making you wonder if you watching a b version of the weather channel. All you get is landscape shots of the storm along with some mindlessly boring dialogue. You're literally seconds away from throwing in the towel when something actually happens. For some reason the storm resurrects a bunch of dead clowns from the sea who died in a bridge collapse. That's it folks, that's your movie. Now please thank Sid for saving you the hour and a half you could have spent doing absolutely anything besides watching this. So obviously we think this one blows and would have no matter what age we were in the past. When you return this one give it the right treatment and scream ""he's gone, the evil's gone from here!""",1,What a sh**y circus,1255392000,"10 13, 2009",2009,1588,"['review', 'number', 'Dan', 'Q', 'Octoberfest', 'horror', 'season', 'decided', 'go', 'little', 'clown', 'horror', 'variety', 'Now', 'let', 'explain', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'type', 'jump', 'bandwagon', 'when', 'liking', 'disliking', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'what', 'someones', 'opinion', 'just', 'everyone', 'was', 'spot', 'here', 'one', 'easily', 'par', 'world', 'top', 'horrific', 'films', 'likeRise', 'ScarecrowsandHalloween', 'Night', 'No', 'matter', 'how', 'b', 'how', 'low', 'budget', 'Sid', 'can', 'find', 'enjoyment', 'almost', 'anything', 'piece', 'trash', 'disasters', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'one', 'top', '5', 'will', 'make', 'appearance', 'Evil', 'Gone', 'Here', 'list.Dead', 'Clowns', 'aka', 'Man', 'dead', 'bear', 'place', 'home', 'video', 'camera', 'somewhere', 'Florida', 'A', 'hurricane', 'coming', 'area', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'making', 'wonder', 'watching', 'b', 'version', 'weather', 'channel', 'get', 'landscape', 'shots', 'storm', 'mindlessly', 'boring', 'dialogue', ""'re"", 'literally', 'away', 'throwing', 'towel', 'when', 'something', 'actually', 'reason', 'storm', 'bunch', 'dead', 'clowns', 'sea', 'who', 'died', 'bridge', 'collapse', 'movie', 'Now', 'thank', 'Sid', 'saving', 'hour', 'half', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'doing', 'absolutely', 'anything', 'watching', 'So', 'obviously', 'think', 'one', 'blows', 'would', 'have', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'were', 'past', 'When', 'return', 'one', 'give', 'right', 'treatment', 'scream', 'gone', 'evil', 'gone', 'here']",Dead Clowns
