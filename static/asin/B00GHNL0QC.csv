If you love this man, and who doesn't, you should watch this DVD.  I was especially moved by the clip of Pope Francis when Pope John Paul II made him a cardinal.  The scenes of this great man with the poor in Argentina are touching, and I loved all the interviews with people that have known him for years.  May God bless him today and always.

1678396,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B00GHNL0QC,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[3, 3]","This glossy 51-minute documentary on the life of Pope Francis, produced by the Knights of Columbus, gives a great overview of who the first Jesuit and (South) American pope really is. I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn about the passions, personality, and cultural background of Pope Francis. But it is talkier and more interview-driven than other Pope Francis documentary DVDs sold here on Amazon, which is both a vice and a virtue.First the negative. Other than location footage in Argentina, we don't get much that is new here outside of interviews and stock footage (some of it very good) from the pope's earlier career when he was known as Father, Bishop, and finally Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio SJ. If you saw this film when it aired on MSNBC and EWTN, you may also like to know that there are no extras on this Janson Media disc, but simply a language choice (English or Spanish) and chapter menu. Some elements of the film are inconsistent, as the pope's Spanish words are always subtitled while other Spanish speakers are sometimes dubbed and sometimes subtitled without any particular consistency. Occasionally, the film's narrative gets buried in what feels like an extended series of interviews strung together, losing the overall thrust of the pope's life story in a lot of talkiness. Between the narrator and the interviewees, there is rarely a wordless moment in this film, and it tells rather than shows the pope's life even when there is an opportunity to let iconic moments (like the conclave and post-election appearance on the balcony) speak for themselves.On the other hand, the actual content of the material is quite good, even insightful at times. The interview footage is well chosen, with a strong preference for Argentinians -- from politicians to ordinary poor folk -- over talking heads or media analysts. A disproportionately large number of the interviews feature native Argentinians who knew ""Father Jorge"" before he was pope, lending a real poignancy to their recollections, and the film is quite good when it lets them share their love of the man's ordinary habits (one woman talks about riding the subway with him) in simple words. Other interviews, kept tactfully brief, are done with American Catholic observers like Supreme Knight Carl Anderson and Bergoglio's friend Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston. Rather than plunging the program into an analysis by American talking heads, these interviews actually have a positive effect, lending just enough of an English-language flavor to the program to prevent it from feeling entirely like a Spanish production translated for U.S. viewers. The English-language interviews and narration do give this video a leg up over ""Who Is Pope Francis?"", another documentary being sold through Ignatius Press in the United States that features so-so English dubbing with occasional mispronunciations. The stock footage is also pretty good, including some concluding video material from World Youth Day in Rio (July 2013) not currently available on other Francis biopics.In the final analysis, my favorite documentary on the new pope is still ""Who Is Pope Francis?"" (see my earlier review of that product) from Spain-based Goya Productions. Despite some odd translation moments, it is more comprehensive than this video, giving a stronger overall narrative of the pope's life and spirituality (barely mentioned in this Knights of Columbus film) and work. It gives you a picture of the man that is concise, broad and fast-moving. It also ""shows"" more than it ""tells"" the pope's life, allowing the viewer to dwell longer on iconic images of Francis at work without the interruption of constant interviews. Nevertheless, I intend to hang onto both films, as ""Francis: The Pope From the New World"" features superior interview material, giving it a complementary power. Whereas the Goya Productions video features interviews primarily with Spain-based commentators and a few Jesuits from Argentina, the Knights of Columbus video features truly heartfelt insights from people who know Francis intimately as friends. While it is talky, this new video is at its best when it simply lets people who know Francis intimately talk about why they love him, and the fact that these people are ""real"" human beings (poor, average, faithful South Americans) is ultimately the biggest point in this video's favor.",5,Interview-driven Pope Francis biopic,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,4372,"['glossy', '51-minute', 'documentary', 'life', 'Pope', 'Francis', 'produced', 'Knights', 'Columbus', 'great', 'overview', 'who', 'first', 'Jesuit', 'South', 'American', 'pope', 'really', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'learn', 'passions', 'personality', 'cultural', 'background', 'Pope', 'Francis', 'talkier', 'more', 'interview-driven', 'other', 'Pope', 'Francis', 'documentary', 'DVDs', 'sold', 'here', 'Amazon', 'vice', 'virtue.First', 'negative', 'Other', 'location', 'footage', 'Argentina', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'new', 'here', 'interviews', 'stock', 'footage', 'very', 'good', 'pope', 'earlier', 'career', 'when', 'was', 'known', 'Father', 'Bishop', 'finally', 'Cardinal', 'Jorge', 'Bergoglio', 'SJ', 'saw', 'film', 'when', 'aired', 'MSNBC', 'EWTN', 'may', 'also', 'like', 'know', 'are', 'extras', 'Janson', 'Media', 'disc', 'simply', 'language', 'choice', 'English', 'Spanish', 'chapter', 'menu', 'elements', 'film', 'are', 'inconsistent', 'pope', 'Spanish', 'words', 'are', 'always', 'subtitled', 'other', 'Spanish', 'speakers', 'are', 'sometimes', 'dubbed', 'sometimes', 'subtitled', 'particular', 'consistency', 'Occasionally', 'film', 'narrative', 'buried', 'what', 'feels', 'extended', 'series', 'interviews', 'strung', 'together', 'losing', 'overall', 'thrust', 'pope', 'life', 'story', 'lot', 'talkiness', 'narrator', 'interviewees', 'rarely', 'wordless', 'moment', 'film', 'rather', 'pope', 'life', 'even', 'when', 'opportunity', 'let', 'iconic', 'moments', 'conclave', 'post-election', 'appearance', 'balcony', 'speak', 'themselves.On', 'other', 'hand', 'actual', 'content', 'material', 'quite', 'good', 'even', 'insightful', 'times', 'interview', 'footage', 'well', 'chosen', 'strong', 'preference', 'Argentinians', 'politicians', 'ordinary', 'poor', 'folk', 'talking', 'heads', 'media', 'analysts', 'disproportionately', 'large', 'number', 'interviews', 'feature', 'native', 'Argentinians', 'who', 'knew', 'Father', 'Jorge', 'was', 'pope', 'lending', 'real', 'poignancy', 'recollections', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'when', 'share', 'love', 'man', 'ordinary', 'habits', 'one', 'woman', 'talks', 'riding', 'subway', 'simple', 'words', 'Other', 'interviews', 'kept', 'tactfully', 'brief', 'are', 'done', 'American', 'Catholic', 'observers', 'Supreme', 'Knight', 'Carl', 'Anderson', 'Bergoglio', 'friend', 'Cardinal', 'Sean', ""O'Malley"", 'Boston', 'Rather', 'plunging', 'program', 'analysis', 'American', 'talking', 'heads', 'interviews', 'actually', 'have', 'positive', 'effect', 'lending', 'just', 'enough', 'English-language', 'flavor', 'program', 'prevent', 'feeling', 'entirely', 'Spanish', 'production', 'translated', 'U.S.', 'viewers', 'English-language', 'interviews', 'narration', 'do', 'give', 'video', 'leg', 'up', 'Who', 'Pope', 'Francis', 'documentary', 'being', 'sold', 'Ignatius', 'Press', 'United', 'States', 'so-so', 'English', 'dubbing', 'occasional', 'mispronunciations', 'stock', 'footage', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'including', 'concluding', 'video', 'material', 'World', 'Youth', 'Day', 'Rio', 'July', '2013', 'not', 'currently', 'available', 'other', 'Francis', 'final', 'analysis', 'favorite', 'documentary', 'new', 'pope', 'still', 'Who', 'Pope', 'Francis', 'see', 'earlier', 'review', 'product', 'Spain-based', 'Goya', 'Productions', 'odd', 'translation', 'moments', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'video', 'giving', 'stronger', 'overall', 'narrative', 'pope', 'life', 'spirituality', 'barely', 'mentioned', 'Knights', 'Columbus', 'film', 'work', 'picture', 'man', 'concise', 'broad', 'fast-moving', 'also', 'shows', 'more', 'tells', 'pope', 'life', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'dwell', 'longer', 'iconic', 'images', 'Francis', 'work', 'interruption', 'constant', 'interviews', 'Nevertheless', 'intend', 'hang', 'films', 'Francis', 'Pope', 'New', 'World', 'superior', 'interview', 'material', 'giving', 'complementary', 'power', 'Goya', 'Productions', 'video', 'features', 'interviews', 'primarily', 'Spain-based', 'commentators', 'few', 'Jesuits', 'Argentina', 'Knights', 'Columbus', 'video', 'features', 'truly', 'heartfelt', 'insights', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'Francis', 'intimately', 'friends', 'talky', 'new', 'video', 'best', 'when', 'simply', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'Francis', 'intimately', 'talk', 'why', 'love', 'fact', 'people', 'are', 'real', 'human', 'beings', 'poor', 'average', 'faithful', 'South', 'Americans', 'ultimately', 'biggest', 'point', 'video', 'favor']",Francis: The Pope From the New World
